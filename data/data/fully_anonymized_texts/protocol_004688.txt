 1 PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
PROTOCOL TITLE: PHASE II STUDY OF LENALIDO MIDE AND ELTROMBOPAG  IN 
PATIENTS WITH SYMPTO MATIC ANEMIA IN LOW OR INTERMEDIATE I 
MYELODYSPLASTIC SYND ROME (MDS)  
DATE PROTOCOL FINAL:  08 JULY 2011  
INDICATION:  MDS  
STUDY PHASE:  Phase II 
BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE: The rationale for this  study is that combined treatment with 
eltrombopag (PROMACTA) and lenalidomide (REVLIMID) will reduce the incidence of 
lenalidomide induced thrombocytopenia thus enabl ing patients to tolerate  the required  duration of 
lenalidomide therapy leading to higher r ates of response  to lenalidomide . A major reason why 
lenalidomide cannot be used for the treatment of  MDS is because of the occurrence of 
thrombocytopenia. The use of eltrombopag will potentially raise platelet counts in these patients and 
enabl e a longer e xposure to lenalidomide.  Secondly, thrombocytopenia in the first [ADDRESS_731458] indicated that eltrombopag is less likely to increase 
blasts thus making it a possible potential therapeutic candidate in low risk MDS.  
STUDY OBJECTIVES:  
Primary  Objectives : 
To evaluate the rate of hematologic improvement of the eltrombopag/lenalidomide combination as 
defined by [CONTACT_190949] 2006 criteria  
To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the eltrombopag/lenalidomide combination in patients with 
low –intermediate risk MDS  
 
Secondary Objectives  
To compare the time to hematologic improvement  
To evaluate the duration of hematologic improvement  
To evaluate the effect of combination treatment on platelet counts, platelet transfusions.and bleeding 
events.  
To evaluate the frequency of bone marrow response (CR+PR) and cytogen etic response.  
To evaluate the relationship between mutations in bone marrow stem cells and response  
To evaluate the relationship between various stem and progenitor alterations and response  
 
 
STUDY DESIGN:  
This is a multicenter, phase II study evaluating the efficacy and safety of the combination of 
lenalidomide and eltrombopag in low risk MDS.

 Patients will be treated based on their baseline platelet counts:  
 
Arm A : Patients with platelet counts > =50k at baseline:  
These patients will start Len at 10mg/d for 3 weeks/month, and will not start eltrombopag until the 
platelet counts drop below 50,000. If platelets drop less than 50,000, Len will be stopped and 
eltrombopag will be started at a dose of 1 00mg initially  ([ADDRESS_731459] Asian heritage)  
and titrated up  to a maximum dose of 300 mg ([ADDRESS_731460] Asian heritage)  to achieve 
a platelet count above 50,000 /L. Once a platelet count above 50,000 is achieved, the same dose of  
eltrombopag will be continued for an additional two weeks. Once a platelet count > 50,[ADDRESS_731461] given to the patient. Once the platelets are increased to above 50,000 and 
maintained at this level for 2 weeks, Len will be started again and this time will be given concurrently 
with eltrombopag. These agents will subsequently  be used concurrently for all subsequent cycles.  
 
Arm B: Patients with Plts <50k at baseline  
These patients will not receive Len initially. Eltrombopag will be started alone at a dose of 100mg 
initially and titrated  up (Table 4)  to achieve a platelet count above 50,000. Once the platelet count 
above 50,000 is achieved, the same dose of eltrombopag will be continued for an  additional two 
weeks. Once the plt count > 50,000 is maintained for two weeks, the patients will  discontinue 
eltrombopag and follow the treatment algorithm described for patients in arm A.

 3 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
3.1 Hypothesis  
 
Combined treatment with eltrombopag (EP) and lenalidomide  (CC-5013 ;REVLIMID) 
will reduce the incidence of thrombocytopenia due to Lenal idomide and enable patients 
to tolerate duration of therapy leading to higher rates of response.  
 
3.2 Treatment of Thrombocyt openia in MDS or sAML/MDS  
In a review of patients with MDS referred to the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, the 
incidence of life -threatening thrombocytopenia was 16 -40% depending on the MDS 
risk status, with a median survival of only 6 to 12 months.  The incidence of 
thrombocytopenia increases with disease progression, and without effective therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], 
some patients may experience life -threatening bleeding (1) 
In MDS, the disease clone incl udes the megakaryocytic lineage .  Megakaryocytes from 
patients with MDS show impaired proliferation and differentiation, thus causing 
thrombocytopenia (2).  Additional aspects potentially contributing to thrombocytopenia 
in MDS are premature cell death of megakaryocytes and decreased platelet life span (3).  
Interestingly, these aspects can be observed in both patients with MDS, and patients with 
Idiopathic  Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP) .  In MDS, the megakaryocytic proliferation 
is unresponsive to recombinant thrombopoietin (TPO), possibly due to deregulated TPO -
receptor -mediated signaling (4) .  In additi on to the qualitative disturbance of the TPO -
receptor, there is also a quantitative disturbance in terms of the number of TPO receptors, 
which show a reduced expression by 50% on MDS platelets, as well as on CD41+ and 
CD34+ ce lls as compared to normal cells.  However, an in vitro study showed that 
CD61+ cells in suspension cultures increased with PEG -rHuMGDF ( pegylated 
recombinant human MGDF)alone in 31 out of 39 patient samples from MDS patients (5).  
The clinical development of PEG -rHuM GDF was aborted owing to the development of 
cross -reacting autoantibodies against endogenous TPO.   More recently, Phase II data 
were presented for another TPO -R agonist, romiplostim, which showed efficacy in 41% 
of the patients with low - or intermediate -1 risk MDS (6)  Howeve r, few patients showed 
some direct or indirect evidence for disease progression [FDA Oncology Drug Advisory 
Committee Meeting, March 2008].

 3.3 Treatment of Thrombocytopenia in MDS or sAML/MDS with Eltrombopag  
Eltrombopag is an orally available, non -peptide  TPO -receptor (TPO -R) agonist that 
stimulates platelet production by a mechanism similar, but not identical to endogenous 
TPO.  Eltrombopag has been investigated at dose ranges of up to 200  mg daily for 5 
days in healthy volunteers, and a dose -platelet res ponse relationship was observed.  In 
ITP, patients received up to 75  mg daily, and response rates were 28% with 30  mg, 
67% with 50 mg, and 86% with 75  mg (response defined as a platelet count >50  Gi/L; 
the studied patients had platelet counts <30  Gi/L).  T he safety profile was similar to 
placebo (7).  The positive results with eltrombopag in ITP are encouraging but the 
required dose and response in MDS are unknown.  A phase I/II study in high risk MDS 
is presently evaluating the efficacy of eltrombopag at different doses with dose 
escalations of up to [ADDRESS_731467] that 12 out of 14 
leukemic/lymphoid cell lines tested demonstrated decreased proliferation when treated 
with eltrombopag, with an IC 50 of 0.5 to 15  g/mL.  This effect  occurs even in the 
presence hematopoietic cytokines. (8-11).  There is add itional evidence from an ex vivo 
study indicating that eltrombopag does not stimulate leukemic cell growth.  In 7 out of 
7 BM specimens taken from patients with MDS or AML secondary to MDS, no 
increase in proliferation due to co -incubation with eltrombopag  was se en (12).  
 
3.4 Lenalidomide can result in transfusion independence  in MDS but leads to a 
high rate of thrombocytopenia  
Ineffective erythropoiesis remains the hallmark of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) 
forwhich few treatments offer sustained erythropoietic improvement (13). Lenalidomide) 
(CC-5013; REVLIMID ) is an oral 4 -amino glutarimide derivative of thalidomid e that 
lacks the neurological toxicities of the parent compound. In a safety and efficacy study 
(MDS -001) investigating erythroid response to CC -5013 (lenalidomide) monotherapy in 
43 patients with MDS, CC -5013 (lenalidomide) yielded a high frequency of maj or 
erythroid response (MER) in patients that had either failed prior treatment with 
erythropoietin or had high endogenous levels and high transfusion burden (14). Patients 
received tr eatment with one of three CC -5013 (lenalidomide) dose schedules, 25 or 10 
mg daily, or 10 mg/day x 21 days every 4 weeks. Neutropenia (67%) and 
thrombocytopenia (57%) > grade 3 NCI -CTC version 2.0 were dose limiting, 
necessitating treatment interruption an d dose -reduction in 25 (61%) patients. Other 
adverse effects were infrequent and of mild to moderate severity including pruritus, 
fatigue, diarrhea, edema,thyroid dysfunction and joint discomfort. Among the 36 patients 
completing more than one cycle of tre atment, 24 (67%) experienced an erythroid 
response according to Internation al Working Group (IWG) criteria . MER defined by 
[CONTACT_556992] -independence (> 8 weeks) or a rise in hemoglobin >2 g/dl was 
achieved in 21 patients and 3 patients experienced  a >50% reduction in red blood cell

 (RBC) transfusions. Response rate was  highest among evaluable patients with a 
chromosome 5q31.1 deletion (91%) compared tothose with a normal karyotype (68%) or 
other chromosome abnormality (17%) [P=0.009],and response rate was higher in patients 
with lower (Low -/Intermediate -1) InternationalPrognostic Scoring System (IPSS) risk 
categories (72% vs. 25%) [ P=0.098] (15). Eleven of17 (65%) patients with karyotypic 
abnormalities had a 50% or greater reduction in abnormalmetaphases, including ten 
(57%) complete cytogenetic remissions. After a median follow -upof 109 weeks in 
November  2004, median duration of transfusion -independence had notbeen reached (81+; 
range, 19 to >128 weeks) with a median sustained hemoglobin (Hgb) of13.4 g/dL (range, 
11.5-15.8 g/dL) and median Hgb rise of 5.6 g/dL. The results of this studyindicate that 
CC-5013 (lenalidomide) has significant and sustained erythropoietic andcytogenetic 
remitting activity in patients with Low/Intermediate -[ADDRESS_731468] year, evaluating the frequency ofMER to lenalidomide in 
patients with transfusion -dependent Low/Int -1 risk MDSwith (MDS -003; N=148) or

Minor + MER rate of 44% in the MDS -002 results (15, 16). Grade 3or greater 
neutropenia or thrombocytopenia were the principal reasons for treatment interruption 
and dose -reduction.  
 
3.5 Rationale for combining lenalidomide and eltrombopag:  
 
The rationale for combination is based on the following:  
 
1. A major reason why lenalidomide cannot be used in MDS is because of the occurrence 
of thrombocytopenia. The use of EP will potentially raise platelet counts in these patients.  
 
2. Thrombocytopenia in the first 2 months after Len therapypredicts the subsequent 
response to lenalidomide tre atment in patients with low risk MDS (17)Thus raising 
platelet counts to enable continuation of lenalidomide therapy is important in these 
patients.  
 
3. An increase in blasts has been a potential concern w ith the use of  thrombopoietin 
mimetics and has been reported in a study with romiplostim (6) Preclinical studies have 
indicated that  eltrombopag is less likely to increase blasts thus making it a possible 
potential therapeutic candidate in low risk MDS (12).

5 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
5.1 Overall design  
 
This is a multicenter, Phase II study evaluating the efficacy and safety of the 
combination of lenalidomide and eltrombopag in low risk MDS. This study will 
include patients with low risk MDS (IPSS low and Int -1) with symptomatic anemia 
or transfusion dependence. Patients will be treated in 2 separate arms based on 
their baseline platelet counts:  
 
Arm A : Patients wi th platelet counts >=50k at baseline:  
These patients will start Len at 10mg/d for 3 weeks/month, and will not start 
Eltrombopag until the platelet counts drop below 50,000. If platelets drop less than 
50,000, Len will be stopped and Eltrombopag will be st arted at a dose of 100mg 
initially and titrated up (similar schema to 509 study) to achieve a platelet count 
above 50,000. Once the platelet count above 50,000 is achieved, the same dose of 
Eltrombopag will be continued for an additional two weeks. Once a platelet count > 
50,[ADDRESS_731469] given to  the patient. Once 
the platelets are increased to above 50,000 and maintained at this level for 2 weeks, 
Len will be started again and this time will be given concurrently with Eltrombopag. 
These agents will now be used concurrently for all subsequent cycl es.  
 
Arm B: Patients with Plts <50k at baseline  
These patients will not receive Len initially. Eltrombopag will be started alone at a 
dose of 100mg initially and titrated up (similar schema to 509 study) to achieve a

 platelet count above 50,000. Once the  platelet count above 50,000 is achieved, the 
same dose of eltrombopag will be continued to additional two weeks. Once the plt 
count > 50,000 is maintained for two weeks, the patients will discontinue 
eltrombopag and follow the treatment algorithm describe d for patients in arm A . 
Patients that never drop their platelet counts below 50,000 will not receive any 
additional eltrombopag. (Figure 1)  
 
Treatment with myeloid growth factors is permitted for the management of 
neutropenia atthe discretion of the treating investigator.  
 
Study drugs will be continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicities.  
 
Bone marrow examinations will be performed at baseline , at every 4 months and at 
study discontinuation.  
 
52 evaluable adult subjects with MDS will be evaluated . 
 
5.2 Protocol Therapy  
5.2.1 Lenalidomide Description  
REVLIMID®  (lenalidomide), a thalidomide analogue, is an immunomodulatory agent 
with anti -angiogenic properties.  The chemical name [CONTACT_832] 3 -(4-amino -1-oxo 1,3-dihydro -
2H-isoindol -2-yl) pi[INVESTIGATOR_119510] -2,6-dione and it has the following chemical structure:

The empi[INVESTIGATOR_193038] C 13H13N3O3, and the gram molecular weight is 
259.3.  
Lenalidomide is an off -white to pale -yellow solid powder. It is soluble in organic 
solvent/water mixtures, and buffered aqueous solvents. Lenalidomide is more soluble in 
organ ic solvents and low pH solutions. Solubility was significantly lower in less acidic 
buffers, ranging from about 0.4 to 0.5 mg/ml. Lenalidomide has an asymmetric carbon 
atom and can exist as the optically active forms S( -) and R(+), and is produced as a 
racemic mixture with a net optical rotation of zero.

 Mechanism of Action:  
The mechanism of action of lenalidomide remains to be fully characterized. 
Lenalidomide possesses immunomodulatory and antiangiogenic properties.  
Lenalidomide in hibited the secretion of pro -inflammatory cytokines and increased the 
secretion of anti -inflammatory cytokines from peripheral blood mononuclear cells.  
Lenalidomide inhibited cell proliferation with varying effectiveness (IC50s) in some but 
not all cell l ines.  Of cell lines tested, lenalidomide was effective in inhibiting growth of 
Namalwa cells (a human B cell lymphoma cell line with a deletion of one chromosome 5) 
but was much less effective in inhibiting growth of KG -1 cells (human myeloblastic cell 
line, also with a deletion of one chromosome 5) and other cell lines without chromosome 
5 deletions. (18, 19)  Lenalidomide inhibited the expression of cyclooxyge nase-2 (COX -
2) but not COX -1 in vitro.  
Pharmacokinetics and Drug Metabolism:  
Absorption: Lenalidomide, in healthy volunteers, is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_299755] 0.[ADDRESS_731470] -dose. Co -administration with food does not alter the extent of absorption 
(AUC) but does reduce the maximal plasma concentration (Cmax) by 36%. The 
pharmacokinetic disposition of lenalidomide is linear. Cmax and AUC increase 
proportionately with increases in dose. Multiple dosing at the recommended dose -
regimen does not result in drug accumulation.  
Pharmacokinetic analyses were performed on 15 multiple myeloma patients treated in the 
phase I studies.  Absorption was found to be rapid on both Day 1 and Day 28 w ith time to 
maximum blood levels ranging from 0.7 to 2.0 hours at all dose levels (5mg, 10mg, 
25mg, and 50mg).  No plasma accumulation was observed with multiple daily dosing.  
Plasma lenalidomide declined in a monophasic manner with elimination half -life ranging 
from 2.8 to 6.1 hours on both Day 1 and 28 at all 4 doses.  Peak and overall plasma 
concentrations were dose proportional over the dosing range of 5mg to 50mg.  Exposure 
(AUC) in multiple myeloma patients is 57% higher than in healthy male voluntee rs.  
Pharmacokinetic Parameters:  
Distribution:  
In vitro (14C)-lenalidomide binding to plasma proteins is approximately 30%.  
Metabolism and Excretion:  
The metabolic profile of lenalidomide in humans has not been studied. In healthy 
volunteers, approximately  two-thirds of lenalidomide is eliminated unchanged through 
urinary excretion. The process exceeds the glomerular filtration rate and therefore is 
partially or entirely active.  Half -life of elimination is approximately 3 hours.  
As the majority of lenalido mide is excreted unchanged by [CONTACT_10521]  (where OATP1B1 
and BCRP are not involved in xenobiotic excretion) , no pharmacokinetic interactions 
between lenalidomide and eltrombopag are expected.

 Metabolism  
Eltrombopag is primarily metabolized through cleavage, oxidation and conjugation 
withglucuronic acid, glutathione, or cysteine. In a human radiolabel study, 
eltrombopagaccounted for approximately 64 % of plasma radiocarbon AUC0 -∞. Minor 
metabolites,each accounting for < 10 % of the plasma radioactivity, arising from 
glucuronidation andoxidation were also detected. Based on a human study with radiolabel 
eltromb opag, it isestimated that approximately 20 % of a dose is metabolised by 
[CONTACT_179694]. In vitro studiesidentified CYP1A2 and CYP2C8 as the isoenzymes responsible 
for oxidativemetabolism, uridine diphosphoglucuronyl transferase UGT1A1 and 
UGT1A3 as theisozymes  responsible for glucuronidation, and that bacteria in the lower 
gastrointestinaltract may be responsible for the cleavage pathways.  
 
Elimination  
Absorbed eltrombopag is extensively metabolised. The predominant route of  
eltrombopag excretion is via faeces (59 %) with 31 % of the dose found in the urine 
asmetabolites. Unchanged parent compound (eltrombopag) is not detected in 
urine.Unchanged eltrombopag excreted in faeces accounts for approximately 20 % of the 
dose.The plasma elimination half -life of eltromb opag is approximately 21 -32 hours.  
 
Special Patient Populations  
 
Renal Impairment  
The pharmacokinetics of eltrombopag has been studied after administration 
ofeltrombopag to adult patients with renal impairment. Following administration of a 
single50 mg -dose, the AUC0 -∞of eltrombopag was decreased by 32 % (90 % CI: 63 
%decrease, 26 % increase) in patients with mild renal impairment, 36 % (90 % CI: 66 
%decrease, 19 % increase) in patients with moderate renal impairment, and 60 % (90 % 
CI:18 % decrease, 80 % d ecrease) in patients with severe renal impairment compared 
withhealthy volunteers. There was a trend for reduced plasma eltrombopag exposure 
inpatients with renal impairment, but there was substantial variability and 
significantoverlap in exposures between  patients with renal impairment and healthy 
volunteers.Patients with impaired renal function should use eltrombopag with caution and 
closemonitoring.  
 
Hepatic Impairment  
The pharmacokinetics of eltrombopag has been studied after administration of  
eltrombop ag to adult subjects with liver cirrhosis (hepatic impairment). Following 
theadministration of a single 50 mg dose, the AUC0 -∞of eltrombopag was increased by 
41 %(90 % CI: 13 % decrease, 128 % increase)in subjects with mild hepatic impairment, 
93 %(90 % CI : 19 %, 213 %) in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment, and 80 % 
(90 %CI: 11 %, 192 %) in subjects with severe hepatic impairment compared with 
healthyvolunteers. There was substantial variability and significant overlap in exposures 
betweensubjects w ith hepatic impairment and healthy volunteers.The influence of hepatic 
impairment on the pharmacokinetics of eltrombopag followingrepeat administration was 
evaluated using a population pharmacokinetic analysis in 28healthy adults and 79

 patients with chron ic liver disease. Based on estimates from thepopulation 
pharmacokinetic analysis, patients with liver cirrhosis (hepatic impairment)had higher 
plasma eltrombopag AUC(0 -τ) values as compared to healthy volunteers, andAUC(0 -τ) 
increased with increasing Child -Pugh score. Compared to healthy volunteers,patients 
with mild hepatic impairment had approximately 87 % to 110 % higher 
plasmaeltrombopag AUC(0 -τ) values and patients with moderate hepatic impairment 
hadapproximately 141 % to 240 % higher plasma eltr ombopag AUC(0 τ) values.Patients 
with liver cirrhosis (hepatic impairment) should use eltrombopag with cautionand close 
monitoring.  
 
Race  
The influence of East Asian ethnicity on the pharmacokinetics of eltrombopag 
wasevaluated using a population pharmacok inetic analysis in 111 healthy adults (31 
EastAsians) and 88 patients with ITP ([ADDRESS_731472] Asians). Based on estimates from 
thepopulation pharmacokinetic analysis, East Asian (i.e. Japanese, Chinese, Taiwanese 
andKorean) ITP patients had approximately 87 % hi gher plasma eltrombopag AUC(0 -
τ)values as compared to non -East Asian patients who were predominantly 
Caucasian,without adjustment for body weight differences.  
 
Gender  
The influence of gender on the pharmacokinetics of eltrombopag was evaluated using 
apopul ation pharmacokinetic analysis in 111 healthy adults (14 females) and 88 
patientswith ITP (57 females). Based on estimates from the population 
pharmacokineticanalysis, female ITP patients had approximately 50 % higher plasma 
eltrombopagAUC(0 -τ) as compared  to male patients, without adjustment for body weight 
differences.

 reduction step when neutrophil count is > 500/ µL.Dose Modi fications for 
Thrombocytopenia  
 
For patients with a baseline platelet count <50,000/ uL; 
Start eltrombopag when the platelet count is < 50,000/ uL. Start Lenalidomide (AND 
STOP eltrombopag) only after platelet count > 50,000  (non transfused)  for atleast 2 
weeks. If platelet fall <50,000/ uL after resuming lenalidomide again then again hold dose 
and start Eltrombopag  again. Once plt count > 5 0,000 for two weeks, then start 
lenalidomide and give eltrombopag concomitantly.  
 
For patients with a baseline platelet count =>50,000 /uL; 
Start Lenalidomide alone. If plt count falls below 50,000/L  then follow algorithm as 
above.  
 
Patients who do not experience platelet recovery within 8weeks of starting Eltrombopag 
should be removed from study and complete all offstudyevaluations.  
 
Dose modifications for hemoglobin levels :  
For those patients experiencing arise in hemoglobin > 14 g/dL, Lenalidomide sh ould be 
withhelduntil the hemoglobin is < 12 g/dL, at which time treatment can be resumed 
accordingto the dose adjustment recommendations in Table 1. For thosepatients 
previously adjusted to the lowest CC -5013 (lenalidomide) dose, the CC -5013 
(lenalidomide) schedule should be changed to a 2 week treatment scheduleevery 4 weeks.  
 
Dose Modifications for Other Adverse Events  
Dose interruption and modification guidelines for other adverse events are in Table  2.  
Lenalidomide  should be held for any > grade 3 adverse events withsuspected drug 
association until resolution to < grade 2. For any patients who doesnot experience 
resolution to < grade 2 within 4 weeks should be removed from studyand complete all 
off-study evaluations. For patients with thro mboembolic events,both agents should be 
discontinued and not resumed until resolution with properprophylaxis according to the 
discretion of the treating investigator.  
NOTE: Patients will be removed from study if lenalidomide  is held forlonger than 8 
weeks  for treatment -related toxicity.

Dosing for Eltrombopag  
 
Patients will initially be started on 100 mg eltrombopag  ([ADDRESS_731485] 
Asian heritage) . Thereafter, dependent on t he platele t response (see Table 3 below), the 
dose of study medication can be increased every 2 weeks, up to a maximum dose of 
300 mg/day  (150 mg/day for subjects of East Asian heritage) .   
 
Modified dosing for subjects of East Asian heritage (i.e., Japanese, Chines e, Taiwanese 
and Korean) has been implemented for the following reasons.  In healthy Japanese 
subjects, plasma eltrombopag AUC (0-) was approximately 80% higher when compared 
to non -Japanese healthy subjects who were predominantly Caucasian.  Similarly, in  
patients with ITP, plasma eltrombopag exposure was approximately 70% higher in East 
Asian (i.e., Japanese, Chinese, Taiwanese and Korean) subjects as compared to non –East 
Asian subjects who were predominantly Caucasian.

 Intra -individual dose adjustments will be made in a stepwise fashion, by [CONTACT_556996] 100  mg, 200  mg or 300  mg as needed  (50, 100, [ADDRESS_731486] Asian heritage) .  Titration of study medication with different dosages 
on different days will be permi tted where needed in order to maintain a stable platelet 
count in the safe range without exceeding platelet counts >400  Gi/L.The dosing 
regimen of eltrombopag must be individualized based on platelet counts. Use the 
lowest effective dosing regimen to maint ain platelet response.  
 
Figure 4: Schema of dose adjustments for eltrombopag  
 
Eltrombopag must be taken either in a fasted state (i.e., 1 hour before or 2 hours after 
food) or taken with food low in calcium  (no dairy products) . There must be at least a 4-
hour interval between eltrombopag and other medications, food, or supplements 
containing polyvalent cations such as iron, calcium, aluminum, magnesium, selenium, 
and zinc , including dairy products . After any eltrombopag dose adjustment, monitor 
platelet counts at least weekly for [ADDRESS_731487] a QTc >480 msec will be excluded

 Special Handling Instructions  
Females of childbearing potential should not handle or administer lenalidomide  unless 
they are wearing gloves.  
 
 
8.2 SUPPORTIVE CARE  
 
1. All supportive measures consistent with optimal patient care will be given 
throughoutthe study.  
 
2. Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_171295]’s well being may be administered atthe 
discretion of the Investigator. These therapi[INVESTIGATOR_12457], 
analgesics,antihistamines, or other medications, and transfusions of red blood cells, 
platelets,or fresh frozen plasma given to assist in the management of 
complicationsassociated with MDS or study treatment.  
 
3.Packed RBCs: Transfusions of two units of pa cked RBCs should be considered 
fordecline in hematocrit (HCT) to < 25% or symptoms of cardiovascular compromise.  
The following transfusion thresholds and guidelines are recommended for 
studyparticipants: HCT < 25%, two units of packed RBCs; HCT < 21%, thre e units 
ofpacked RBCs; HCT < 18%, four units of packed RBCs.  
 
4 Platelets: Eight to ten units of random donor platelets or one cytopheresis unit ofsingle 
donor platelets should be administered to all subjects with signs of hemostaticfailure (i.e., 
bleeding  or petechiae) or life threatening thrombocytopenia (i.e., plateletcount < 
10,000/μL).  
 
5 Patients should not receive androgens or steroids for supportive treatment of their 
anemia or thrombocytopenia  
 
6 Patients may receive hydrocortisone prophylacticall y to prevent transfusion  
reactions. Steroids given for adrenal failure, hormones administered for non -
cancerrelatedconditions (e.g. insulin for diabetes), and intermittent uses of 
dexamethasoneas an antiemetic are permitted concomitantly with study drug. S hort 
courses ofsteroids to treat study drug -induced skin rashes are also permitted.  
 
8.3 DURATION OF THERAPY

ALT 3xULN and bilirubin 1.5xULN (>35% direct).ALT 5xULN.  
ALT 3xULN if associated with the appearance or worsening of hepatitis symptoms or 
rash.  
All subjects who discontinue study medication should continue to participate in the 
follow -up visits.  
8.[ADDRESS_731491] follow -up procedures, subjects should consult theinvestigator and 
details should be recorded in the eCRF.  
 
Antacids, Cations and Vitamin/Mineral Supplements  
Administration of eltrombopag with a polyvalent cation -containing antacid 
decreasedplasma elt rombopag exposure by 70%, and a similar reduction was observed 
wheneltrombopag was administered with a high -calcium meal. Therefore, every effort 
must bemade to educate subjects on how to take study medication with medications or 
foodscontaining these poly valent cations. Details of these and all concomitant 
medicationsshould be recorded in the eCRF.  
Eltrombopag should be taken on an empty stomach (1 hour before or 2 hours aftera 
meal)  or taken with food low in calcium (no dairy products) . Allow at least a 4  hour 
interval between eltrombopag and othermedications , foods,  or products containing 
polyvalent cations (e.g. calcium, magnesium,aluminium, zinc, selenium or iron) such

in eltrombopag absorption due tochelation.  
 
Antacids  
Subjects requiring routine (e.g. daily) acid suppression should be encouraged to take 
H2antagonists like ranitidine, famotidine or nizatidine, or proton pump inhibitors 
likeomeprazole, esomeprazole or lans oprazole.  
Subjects requiring occasional acid suppression may take liquid or chewable 
antacids(calcium carbonate, aluminum hydroxide or magnesium hydroxide), provided 
studymedication is taken at least 4 hours before and 4 hours after consumption of 
cation containingantacids.  
AL UM2008/[ZIP_CODE]/00  
Mineral Supplements and Dairy Products  
Mineral supplements (such as calcium, magnesium, aluminium, zinc, selenium or 
iron)are permitted during the study but study medication must be taken at least [ADDRESS_731492] 4 hours before and 4 hours after consumption of dairy products (such 
asmilk, yogurt, and cheese).  
 
HMG -CoA Reductase Inhibitors (statins)  
Subjects will be permitted to use HMG -CoA reductase (3 -hydroxy -3-methyl -glutaryl - 
CoA) inhibitors during the study, but these drugs should be used with caution and a 50% 
dose reduction of the HMG -CoA reductase inhibitor is recommended, with close 
monitoring for safety, such as liver  chemistry and signs and symptoms of myolysis, and 
efficacy, such as cholesterol and triglycerides (refer to individual product information for 
monitoring recommendations).  
Preclinical data showed that eltrombopag is an inhibitor of the transporters OATP1B [ADDRESS_731493] of 
eltrombopag on the PK of rosuvastatin, an OATP1B1 and BCRP substrate, was 
conducted in healthy subjects. Co -administration of eltrombopag 75 mg once daily for 5 
days with a single 10mg dose of rosuvastatin administered on Day 5 increased plasma 
rosuvastatin Cmax 2.03 -fold and AUC(0 -∞) 55%. Concomitant administration of 
eltrombopag and other OATP1B1 or BCRP substrates should be used with caution.  
NFIDENTIAL UM2008/[ZIP_CODE]/00  
Concomitant MDS Therapy  
G-CSF is allowed during the study for subjects with severe neutropenia and 
recurrentinfections. Subjects who enter the study on G -CSF should continue at the same 
doseschedule until the optimal dose of study medication has been estab lished.  
Any change in dosage of any concomitant medication (change in dose or 
frequency)MUST be recorded in the eCRF, to include: drug name, dose, frequency 
ofadministration, start and stop dates and indication.

The following medications are prohibited during the study:  
• Any other TPO -R agonists  
• Treatment with deferasirox. Deferasirox shares some aspects of the safety profile 
ofeltrombopag, and should therefore not be combined with eltrombopag to allow for 
abetter identification of potenti al, eltrombopag -related events . 
• Drugs that affect platelet function (including, but not limited to, aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], 
clopi[INVESTIGATOR_556969]/or NSAIDS) may also affect the results of the bleeding scale assessments 
duringthe study and are therefore prohibited. In the event their use is clinically

bleedinganalyses.  
• Anticoagulants (e.g. warfarin, heparin) may also affect results of the bleeding

Increased Liver Chemistries : Eltrombopag administration may cause  hepatotoxicity. In 
the ITP controlled clinical studies, one patient experienced Grade 4 ( NCI Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [NCI CTCAE] toxicity scale) elevations in 
serum liver test values during therapy with Eltrombopag, worsening of und erlying 
cardiopulmonary disease, and death. One patient in the placebo group experienced a 
Grade [ADDRESS_731495] abnormalities (predominantly Grade 2 or less in severity) were reported 
in 11% and 7% of the eltrombopag and placebo groups, respectively. In the three

the ITP extension study, one additional patient had eltrombopag discontinued due to liver 
test abnormalities (all Grade 3) . 
 
Serum ALT, AST, and bilirubin should be measured prior to initiation of eltrombopag, 
every 2  weeks during the dose adjustment phase and monthly following establishment of 
a stable dose. If bilirubin is elevated, pe rform fractionation. Evaluate abnormal serum 
liver tests with repeat testing within 3 to 5 days. If the abnormalities are confirmed, 
monitor serum liver tests weekly until the abnormality(ies) resolve, stabilize, or return to 
baseline levels. Permanently discontinue eltrombopag if ALT levels increase to 3X the 
upper limit of normal (ULN) and are: 
 progressive, or  
 persistent for 4 weeks, or  
 accompanied by [CONTACT_218080], or  
 accompanied by [CONTACT_556998].  
  
Pharmacokinetic evaluations in patients with hepatic impairment show that plasma 
eltrombopag AUC (0-) increases with increasing degree of hepatic impairment (as 
measured by [CONTACT_2751] -Pugh). Exercise caution when administering eltrombopag to patients 
with hepatic impairment (Child -Pugh Class A, B, C) . Use a lower starting dose of 
eltrombopag in patients with any degree of hepatic impairment i.e. cirrhosis and monitor 
closely  
 
Bone Marrow Reticulin Formation and Risk for Bone Marrow Fibrosis  
Eltrombopag is a thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor agonist and TPO -receptor agonists may 
increase the risk for the developme nt or progression of reticulin fiber deposition within 
the bone marrow.  
  
In the ITP extension study, [ADDRESS_731497] had bone marrow biopsiesevaluated for 
increased reticulin and collagen fiber deposition. Bone marrow biopsies taken after 1  year 
of the rapy showed predominantly myelofibrosis (MF) Grade 1 or less in 140/151 (93%) 
of patients. There were 11/151 (7%) of patients with MF Grade 2. Four patients had 
collagen deposition reported. One patient with a pre -existing MF Grade [ADDRESS_731498] not yet excluded a risk of bone marrow fibrosis with cytopenias.  
  
Prior to initiation of eltrombopag, the peripheral blood smear should be examined closely 
to establish a ba seline level of cellular morphologic abnormalities. Following 
identification of a stable dose of eltrombopag, peripheral blood smears and CBCs should 
be examined monthly for new or worsening morphological abnormalities (e.g., teardrop 
and nucleated red blo od cells, immature white blood cells) or cytopenia. If the patient

Version: 07 January 2016  
 develops new or worsening morphological abnormalities or cytopenia, treatment with 
eltrombopag should be discontinued and a bone marrow biopsy, including staining for 
fibrosis considered.  
 
Recurrence of Thrombocytopenia After Cessation of Eltrombopag  
Discontinuation of eltrombopag may result in recurrence of thrombocytopenia. This 
recurrence of thrombocytopenia may increase the patient's risk of bleeding, particularly if 
eltrombopag is disc ontinued while the patient is on anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents. 
In the  3 controlled ITP clinical studies, transient decreases in platelet counts to levels 
lower than baseline were observed following discontinuation of treatment in 8% and 8% 
of the  eltrombopag and placebo groups, respectively.  Serious hemorrhagic events 
requiring the use of supportive ITP medications occurred in 4 severely thrombocytopenic 
patients within one month following the discontinuation of eltrombopag; none were 
reported am ong patients in the placebo group.  
  
Following discontinuation of eltrombopag, weekly CBCs, including platelet counts for at 
least 4 weeks should be obtained and alternative treatments for recurrence 
ofthrombocytopenia, according to current treatment guid elines, considered.  
 
Thrombotic/thromboembolic complications  
Eltrombopag may increase the risk of thrombotic/thromboembolic events.. Excessive 
doses of eltrombopag may increase platelet counts to a level that produces 
thrombotic/thromboembolic complicatio ns.  
In the 3 controlled ITP clinical studies, thrombotic/thromboembolic complications 
occurred in four patients in the groups that received eltrombopag and none in the placebo 
groups.Thrombotic/thromboembolic complications have also been reported in the I TP 
extension study. The thrombotic/thromboembolic complications in patients with chronic 
ITP included both venous and arterial events and were observed at low and normal 
platelet counts.  
Use caution when administering eltrombopag to patients with known ris k factors for 
thromboembolism (e.g., Factor V Leiden, ATIII deficiency, antiphospholipid syndrome, 
chronic liver disease). To minimize the risk for thrombotic/thromboembolic 
complications, do not use eltrombopag in an attempt to normalize platelet counts. Follow 
the dose adjustment guidelines to achieve and maintain a platelet count of 50 x 109/L as 
necessary to decrease the risk for bleeding  
In a placebo -controlled double -blind study (ELEVATE) of 292 patients with chronic 
liver disease who were undergoing  an elective  surgical procedure, the risk of portal 
venous thrombosis was increased in patients treated with 75  mg eltrombopag once daily 
for 2  weeks in preparation for their invasive procedure. Seven thrombotic complications 
(six patients) were reported within the group that received eltrombopag and three 
thrombotic complications were reported in the placebo group (two patients). All of the 
thrombotic complications reported within the eltrombopag group were of the portal 
venous system. Five of the six pat ients in the group that received eltrombopag

 experienced a thrombotic complication within 30 days of completing treatment with 
eltrombopag and at a platelet count above 200 x 109/L. Malignancy is known to increase 
the risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a thrombotic event and four  of the 6 patients either had a 
diagnosis or suspi[INVESTIGATOR_556973] (2 hepatocellular carcinoma; 1 possible lymphoma 
and 1 brain tumor).     
 
Caution should be exercised w hen administering eltrombopag to patients with hepatic 
impairment (Child -Pugh Class A, B, C)  and  a lower starting dose of eltrombopag should 
be used in patients with any degree of hepatic impairment.  Such patients should be 
monitored very closely. Eltrom bopag is not indicated for the treatment of 
thrombocytopenia in patients with chronic liver disease.  
The ELEVATE study was terminated in November 2009 and a Dear Health Care 
Professional Letter (DHCPL) was sent to all physicians enrolled in Promacta  Cares in 
May 2010.   
 
Hematologic Malignancies and Progression of Malignancies  
Stimulation of the TPO receptor on the surface of hematopoietic cells by [CONTACT_556999]. In the controlled clinical studies, 
patients were treated with eltrombopag for a maximum of 6  months. During this perio d 
no hematologic malignancies were reported in patients treated with eltrombopag. One 
hematologic malignancy (non -Hodgkin's lymphoma) was reported in the extension 
study.Eltrombopag is not indicated for the treatment of thrombocytopenia due to diseases 
or treatments that cause thrombocytopenia (e.g., myelodysplasia or chemotherapy) other 
than chronic ITP.  
 
Cataracts Cataracts were observed in toxicology studies of eltrombopag in rodents (see 
Non-clinical Information). To date, there is however, no evidence  that eltrombopag 
increases the incidence nor progression of cataracts in patients who have received 
eltrombopag.  In the three placebo -controlled ITP studies, 7% of patients in both the 
placebo and eltrombopag treatment groups had a report of cataract.  A  significant 
proportion of patients in the ITP clinical studies were also exposed to chronic 
corticosteroid administration.   
 
Routine monitoring of patients for cataracts is recommended. Patients treated with 
eltrombopag who experience visual difficulties  should have an appropriate 
ophthalmologic evaluation

 Is possibly, probably or definitely related to participation in the research; AND  
 fatal, life -threatening, or serious OR suggests greater risk of harm to study 
participant(s)or others than was prev iously known or recognized.  
(A) Unexpected:  
An event can be categorized as unexpected if it occurs in one or more subjects  
participating in a research protocol; and the nature, severity, or frequency of  
which is not consistent with either:  
 The known or foreseeable risk of adverse events associated with the 
procedures involved in the researc h that are described in protocol -related 
docume nts such as: the IRB -approved research protocol; any applicable 
investigator brochure: the current IRB -approved informed consent document; 
or other relevant sources of information, such as product labeling and  package 
inserts; or  
 The expected natural progression ofany underlying disease, disorder, or 
cond ition of the subject(s) experiencing the adverse event and the subject’s 
predisposing risk factor profile for the adverse event.

 1“Life -threatening” means that the subject was at immediate risk of death at the 
time of the serious adverse event; it does not refer to a serious adverse event that 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  
2“Persistent or significant disability or incapacity” means that there is a 
substantial disruption of a person’s ability to carry out normal life functions.

All SAEs mus t be reported to the Montefiore -Einstein PI [INVESTIGATOR_303943] 24 hours of 
being awa re of the event. The Montefiore -Einstein Research team will inform study 
supporters and collaborating centers of reportable events .  
 
Toxicity will be scored using CTCAE Version 4.0 for toxicity and adverse event 
reporting.  A copy of the CTCAE Version 4.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP 
homepage ( HTTP://CTEP.INFO.NIH .GOV ).  All appropriate trea tment areas should 
have access to a copy of the CTCAE Version 4.0.  All adverse clinical experiences, 
whether observed by [CONTACT_56313], must be recorded, with 
details about the duration and intensity of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], the acti on taken with respect to 
the test drug, and the patient’s outcome.  The investigator must evaluate each adverse 
experience for its relationship to the test drug and for its seriousness.  
 
The investigator must appraise all abnormal laboratory results for their clinical 
significance.  If any abnormal laboratory result is considered clinically significant, the 
investigator must provide details about the action taken with respect to the test drug and 
about the patient’s outcome.  
 
During clinical trials, adver se events can be spontaneo usly reported or elicited during 
open -ended questioning, exam ination, or evaluation of a subject. (In order to prevent 
reporting bias, subjects should not be questioned regarding the specific occurrence of one 
or more adverse even ts.) 
 
Adverse events (AEs) will be recorded in the case report form for the duration of the trial, 
regardless of whether or not the event(s) are considered related to trial medication. All 
AEs considered related to trial medication will be followed until r esolution even if this

12 DATA  MANAGEMENT  
12.1 Analyses and Reporting  
Data will be analyzed and reported after 25 patients are enrolled.  All subsequent data 
collected will be analyzed and reported in a follow -up clinical report  by [CONTACT_978] .  
12.2 Study auditing  
12.2.1  Investigator responsibilities  
Investigator responsibilities are set out in the ICH guideline for Good Clinical Practice 
(GCP) and in the US Code of Federal Regulations.  
Investigators must enter study data onto CRFs or other data collection system.  The 
Investigator wil l permit study -related audits by [CONTACT_193089], IRB/EC 
review, and regulatory inspec tion(s) (e.g., FDA, EMEA, TPP), providing direct access to 
the facilities where the study took place, to source documents, to CRFs, and to all other 
study  documents.  
[ADDRESS_731514] (DSMB). This board meets once a month 
with any additional meetings schedule d when needed. The responsibilities are as follows:  
 
 Familiarize themselves with the research protocol (s)  
 The DSMB reviews trial performance information such as accrual information.

  Review interim analyses of outcome data and cumulative toxicity data summaries 
to determine whether the trial should continue as originally designed, should be 
changed, or should be terminated based on these data.   
 The DSMB also determines whether and to whom outcome results should be 
released prior to the reporting of stu dy results.  
 All adverse events are reviewed by [CONTACT_942], with assurances that these have 
been in fact sent for review to all pertinent IRBs.  
 Review of reports of related studies to determine whether the monitored study 
needs to be changed or terminate d. 
 Review major proposed modifications to the study prior to their implementation 
(e.g., termination, droppi[INVESTIGATOR_556979], increasing target sample size).  
 Following each DSMB meeting, provide the study  leadership with written 
information concerning findings for the trial as a whole related to cumulative 
toxicities observed and any relevant recommendations related to continuing, 
changing, or terminating the trial.  
 
 The study leadership will provide information on cumulative toxicities and relevant 
recommendations to the local principal investigators to be shared with their IRB’s.  
[ADDRESS_731515] lCAL  ANALYSIS  
14.1 Safety evaluation  
Data from all subjects who receive any protoc ol therapy  will be included in the safety 
analyses. Subjects who entered the study and did not receive any protocol therapy  and 
had this confirmed, will not be evaluated for safety.  
The severity of the toxicities will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE v 4.0 whenever 
possible.  
14.2 Sample size and power considerations  
The primary outcome is major erythroid response. A maximum of 52 patients will be 
enrolled into the study.   An early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_556980]’s optimal two -stage design.   After the first [ADDRESS_731516] been evaluated.   At the end of the trial, the treatment will 
be considered efficacious and worthy of further study if 17 or more patients respond out 
of 52 patients.  
 
The target response rate is assumed to be 40%. (Conservative  estimate)   A response rate 
less than 25% is considered to be clinically unimportant (21).  Under these assumptions, 
the design specified above has the following operating characteristics.   The probability 
of accepting  the treatment for further study if the response rate is unacceptably low

 HiSeq2000 instrument. . The transcriptome patterns will be correlated with response.  In 
addition to gene expression patterns, this study will also correlate mutations and sin gle 
nucleotide polymorphisms with response to lenalidomide and eltrombopag. Somatic 
mutations will be identified by [CONTACT_557005] (toenail clippi[INVESTIGATOR_556984]) samples.  
 
b. Analysis of “MDS” stem cells pre and post treatment with t he combination of 
eltrombopag and lenalidomide and their correlation with response (Study co -chair Dr . 
Ulrich Steidl is an expert in flow sorting of leukemia stem cells and their functional 
characterization, both in vitro and in vivo).  Using high -speed mul ti-parameter 
fluorescence -activated cell sorting we will separate bone marrow progenitors into long -
term and short -term hematopoietic stem cells as well as more committed myeloid, 
erythroid and megakaryocytic progenitors, as performed previously (22, 23). Stem cell 
compartments expanded in MDS as compared to normal bone marrow will be identified.  
Sorted cell fractions will be studied for the presence of pathogeni c mutations and 
characteristic chromosomal lesions. Functional validation of sorted cell populations will 
be performed in vitro and in vivo.  
 
Our preliminary studies indicate that primitive stem cells (LT -HSCs and ST -HSCs) are 
expanded in MDS and harbor i nitiating karyotypic abnormalities and striking alterations 
in DNA methylation with an accumulation of aberrantly hypermethylated loci. 
Furthermore, we and others observe that karyotypi[INVESTIGATOR_556985] (24). These preliminary data lead us to hypothesize  that a pool of 
disease -initiating stem or early progenitor cells exists in MDS that contains and 
progressively acquires genetic and epi[INVESTIGATOR_556986].  The study of these MDS cells -of-origin and MDS -initiating cell 
population s will reveal fundamentally new information about early  pathogenic events , 
which represent particularly promising targets for therapeutic intervention, as well as  the 
modes of MDS progression.   
Quantitative and cytogenetic assessment of MDS stem and progenitor cells from marrow 
samples of responders and non -responders to lenalidomide and eltrombopag will be 
performed. Karyotypic , transcriptomal,  as well as methylomic analysis of these cells will 
be conducted for clonal genetic and epig enetic assessment. Comparison of pretreatment 
and post treatment samples from both subsets of patients will demonstrate whether a 
decrease in clonal stem cells correlates with clinical response. We will also determine 
whether persistence of clonal stem cel ls in responders correlates with a risk of future 
relapse.

Risks Associated with Pregnancy  
The use of lenalidomide in pregnant females and nursing mothers has not been studied 
nor has the effect of the lenalidomide on human eggs and sperm.  Lenalidomide is 
structurally related to thalidomide.  Thalidomide is a known human teratogenic active 
substance that causes severe life -threatening birth defects.  An embryofetal development 
study in animals indicates that lenalidomide produced malformations in the offspring of 
female monkeys who received the drug during  pregnancy.  The teratogenic effect of 
lenalidomide in humans cannot be ruled out.  Therefore, a risk minimization plan to 
prevent pregnancy must be observed.  
All study participants must be registered into the mandatory Revlimid REMS™  program, 
and be willing and able to comply with the requirements of Revlimid REMS™ . 
Criteria for females of childbearing potential (FCBP)  
This protocol defines a female of childbearing potential as a sexually mature female who: 
1) has not undergone a hyst erectomy or bilateral oophorectomy or 2) has not been 
naturally postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any 
time in the preceding 24 consecutive months).  
The investigator must ensure that:  
 Females of childbearing potentia l comply with the conditions for pregnancy risk 
minimization, including confirmation that she has an adequate level of 
understanding  
 Females NOT of childbearing potential acknowledge that she understands the 
hazards and necessary precautions associated wit h the use of lenalidomide  
 Male patients taking lenalidomide acknowledge that he understands that traces of 
lenalidomide have been found in semen, that he understands the potential 
teratogenic risk if engaged in sexual activity with a female of childbearing  
potential, and that he understands the need for the use of a condom even if he has 
had a vasectomy, if engaged in sexual activity with a female of childbearing 
potential.   
Contraception  
Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) enrolled in this protocol m ust agree to use two 
reliable forms of contraception simultaneously or to practice complete abstinence from

 heterosexual intercourse during the following time periods related to this study: 1) for at 
least 28 days before starting lenalidomide; 2) throughou t the entire duration of 
lenalidomide treatment; 3) during dose interruptions; and 4) for at least [ADDRESS_731535] include one highly effective method and 
one additional effective (barrier) method. FCBP must be referred to a qualified provider 
of contraceptive methods if needed. The following are examples of highly effective and 
additional effective methods of contraception:   
o Highly effective methods:  
 Intrauterine device (IUD)  
 Horm onal (birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], injections, implants)  
 Tubal ligation  
 Partner’s vasectomy  
o Additional effective methods:  
 Male condom  
 Diaphragm  
 Cervical Cap  
Because of the increased risk of venous thromboembolism in patients with multiple 
myeloma taking lenalidomi de and dexamethasone, combined oral contraceptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_196989]. If a patient is currently using combined oral contraception the patient 
should switch to one of the effective method listed above. The risk of venous 
thromboembolism continues for  4−6 weeks after discontinuing combined oral 
contraception. The efficacy of contraceptive steroids may be reduced during co -treatment 
with dexamethasone.  
Implants and levonorgestrel -releasing intrauterine systems are associated with an 
increased risk of in fection at the time of insertion and irregular vaginal bleeding. 
Prophylactic antibiotics should be considered particularly in patients with neutropenia.  
Pregnancy testing  
Medically supervised pregnancy tests with a minimum sensitivity of 50 mIU/mL must b e 
performed for females of childbearing potential, including females of childbearing 
potential who commit to complete abstinence, as outlined below.

 Female Patients:  
FCBP must have two negative pregnancy tests (sensitivity of at least 50 mIU/mL) prior to 
prescribing lenalidomide.  The first pregnancy test must be performed within [ADDRESS_731536] be perform ed 
within 24 hours prior to prescribing lenalidomide.  The patient may not receive 
lenalidomide until the Investigator has verified that the results of these pregnancy tests 
are negative.  
Male Patients : 
Must agree to practice complete abstinence or agree t o use a condom during sexual 
contact [CONTACT_197013], during dose interruptions and for at least 28 days 
following lenalidomide discontinuation, even if he has undergone a successful 
vasectomy.   
During study participation and for 28 days following lenalidomide discontinuation  
Female Patients:  
 FCBP with regular or no menstrual cycles must agree to have pregnancy tests 
weekly for the first [ADDRESS_731537] 28 days of lenalidomide treatment, including dose interruptions, and then 
every 14 days throughout the remaining duration of lenalidomide treatment, 
including dose interruption s, at lenalidomide discontinuation, and at Day 14 and 
Day 28 following lenalidomide discontinuation.   
 At each visit, the Investigator must confirm with the FCBP that she is continuing 
to use two reliable methods of birth control at each visit during the t ime that birth 
control is required.   
 If pregnancy or a positive pregnancy test does occur in a study patient, 
lenalidomide must be immediately discontinued.  
 Pregnancy testing and counseling must be performed if a patient misses her period 
or if her pregna ncy test or her menstrual bleeding is abnormal.  Lenalidomide 
treatment must be temporarily discontinued during this evaluation.

 If pregnancy or a positive pregnancy test does occur in the partner of a male study 
patient during study participation, the investigator must be notified im mediately.  
Additional precautions  
 Patients should be instructed never to give lenalidomide to another person.  
 Female patients should not donate blood during therapy and for at least 28 days 
following discontinuation of lenalidomide.  
 Male patients should no t donate blood, semen or sperm during therapy or for at 
least 28 days following discontinuation of lenalidomide.  
 Only enough lenalidomide for one cycle of therapy may be prescribed with each

Angiotensin II Receptor Inhibition to Improve Microvascular Function in Women who have had Preeclampsia
I.3 Short T itle (optional):
Losartan for Vascular Function after Preeclampsia
I.[ADDRESS_699809] whether taking a medication that blocks angiotensin II receptors
(losartan) decrease these negative ef fects in women who have had preeclampsia. Identification of these mechanisms and treatment strategies
may lead to better clinical management of cardiovascular disease risk in these women.
In this study we are recruiting women who have had preeclampsia in the past 5 years. We use the blood vessels in the skin as a representative
vascular bed. Using a minimally invasive technique (intradermal microdialysis for the local delivery of pharmaceutical agents) we examine
the blood vessels in a nickle-sized area of the skin in women who have had preeclampsia. We make these measurements after the subjects
take a placebo and after they take losartan (an angiotensin II receptor blocker) to test whether this treatment improves vascular function in
these women. Because losartan can have dangerous ef fects on a fetus, women enrolled in this study will be required to use an ef fective form
of birth control [hormonal patch, implant or pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]; intrauterine device; consistent use of barrier contraceptive; or prior medical procedure to
prevent pregnancy (i.e. tubal ligation or vasectomy in current partner)]. As a compliment to these measurements, we also draw blood from the
subjects and isolate the inflammatory cells to test how sensitive their inflammatory responses are following the placebo and the losartan
treatment.
A modification was submitted changing the eligibility requirements from having preeclampsia within the past [ADDRESS_699810] 5 years to match the other preeclampsia studies in our lab (IRB #202203433, 202303202, 202303799).
I.5 Specify your research question(s), study aims or hypotheses (do not indicate "see protocol")
AIM: To determine the ef fect of systemic AT1R inhibition (oral losartan) on in vivo and in vitro measures of inflammation and endothelial
function in women who have had preeclampsia (PE) . Utilizing a chronic (6 week) losartan intervention coupled with intradermal
microdialysis and assessment of the inflammatory response to ang II stimulation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), we will test
the hypotheses that therapeutic doses of the AT1R inhibitor augment endothelium-dependent dilation and reduce inflammation in PE.
HYPOTHESES
1: Chronic oral losartan therapy will augment endothelium-dependent dilation in PE by [CONTACT_104700]-dependent dilation.
2: Chronic oral losartan therapy will attenuate exaggerated ang II sensitivity in PE.
3: Chronic oral losartan therapy will reduce circulating inflammatory cytokines, and attenuate the exaggerated inflammatory response to ang
II stimulation in PBMCs from PE.
NOTE: This IRB protocol encompasses the projects of aim 3 in the attached NIH K99/R00 award. Aim 2 has been completed and aim 1 is
approved under HawIRB #201909818.
I.6 Background and significance and/or Preliminary studies related to this project.
(do not  indicate "see protocol")
Angiotensin II Sensitivity Contributes to Endothelial Dysfunction Following Preeclampsia: Women with a history of preeclampsia have an
exaggerated presser response to systemic infusion of Ang II. Similarly , compelling in vivo pi[INVESTIGATOR_537368]. Ang II mediates several events of the inflammatory process including activation of the vascular endothelium; and
AT1R activation plays a lar ge role in the pathophysiology of concurrent inflammatory reactions through this direct action on local vascular
cells. Inhibition of Ang II, either through ACE inhibition or AT1-receptor antagonism, reduces tissues inflammation and oxidative injury .
Reciprocally , inhibition of inflammatory mediators such as IL-[ADDRESS_699811] had preeclampsia.

Trial.
Clinical (or  Treatment) trial  – A prospective biomedical or behavioral research study of new treatments, new drug or combinations of
drugs, new devices, or new approaches to sur gery or radiation therapy . (NIH and ClinicalT rials.gov  & FDA ) The University of Iowa
requires a freestanding protocol.
Physiology intervention/study  – A pharmacologic or measurement study aimed at understanding basic mechanisms of disease and/or
of normal human physiology , often without any therapeutic intent (though a clinical trial could include such components, often labeled
as “translational” or “basic science” aims.) Measurements in such studies could include, but are not limited to, a blood draw , EKG,
EEG, MRI, auditory or sensory testing, checking vital signs, DEXA  scans, eye tracking, specimen collection, exercise, fasting, special
diets, etc.
Behavioral intervention/study  – May be used to refer to studies of individual or group behavior . This option does not include drugs,
biologics, or devices but could include psychotherapy , lifestyle counseling, behavior modification, etc.
Diagnostic trial  – Protocol designed to evaluate one or more interventions aimed at identifying a disease or health condition
(ClinicalT rials.gov  & FDA )
Observational
Expanded Access  – A process regulated by [CONTACT_2165] (FDA) that allows manufacturers to provide investigational
new drugs to patients with serious diseases or conditions who cannot participate in a clinical trial. Examples of expanded access include
non-protocol access to experimental treatments, including protocol exception, single-patient IND, treatment IND, compassionate use,
emer gency use, continued access to investigational drug, and parallel track ( ClinicalT rials.gov  & FDA ).
Registry  – The collection and maintenance of data (not including biologic samples) in which: (1) the individuals in the registry have a
common or related condition(s), and/or (2) the individuals in the registry are interested in being contact[CONTACT_518705].( UI Guide )
Repository  – The collection, storage, and distribution of human biologic samples and/or data materials for research purposes. Repository
activities involve three components: (i) the collection of data and/or specimens such as blood, tissue, saliva, etc.; (ii) the storage of data or
specimens, and data management function; and (iii) the sharing of data/specimens with recipi[INVESTIGATOR_518689]. (paraphrased from OHRP )
Other
Phase I trials  – include initial studies to determine the metabolism and pharmacologic actions of drugs in humans, the side ef fects
associated with increasing doses, and to gain early evidence of ef fectiveness; may include healthy participants and/or patients
(ClinicalT rials.gov  & FDA )
Phase II trials  – include controlled clinical studies conducted to evaluate the ef fectiveness of the drug for a particular indication or
indications in patients with the disease or condition under study and to determine the common short-term side ef fects and
risks( ClinicalT rials.gov  & FDA )
Phase III trials  – include expanded controlled and uncontrolled trials after preliminary evidence suggesting ef fectiveness of the
drug has been obtained, and are intended to gather additional information to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug
and provide an adequate basis for physician labeling( ClinicalT rials.gov  & FDA )

Long-term followup and how it occurs
Visit 1 - Consent and Screening (approximately 1 hour)
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_537374] f explain the study and go over the informed consent with the participant. After the participant signs the informed consent,
the PI [INVESTIGATOR_537374] f performs the physical screening that includes urine pregnancy test, heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), height, waist
circumference, and weight measurements. The participant fills out the health history questionnaire and confirms that they are using an ef fective
form of birth control. A research nurse performs or approved laboratory personnel standard venipuncture to obtain blood (total = 7.5ml blood) for
complete blood count (CBC), chemistry analysis, and lipid profile to be measured at UIHC pathology labs. The subject provides a urine sample for
the measurement of urine proteins which will be measured by [CONTACT_537393].
Visits 2 and 5- Pi[INVESTIGATOR_119150] (approximately 15 minutes)
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_537374] f give the participant study medication (losartan or placebo). The PI [INVESTIGATOR_537374] f goes over the instructions for taking the
study medication which includes how many pi[INVESTIGATOR_537375] , potential side ef fects, and who to call if they have questions or
problems while taking the medication.
Visits 3 and 6 - Pi[INVESTIGATOR_7049] 24 hour blood pressure monitor (approximately 15 minutes)
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_537374] f instrument the participant with the 24 hour blood pressure monitor . The PI [INVESTIGATOR_537374] f goes over the instructions for
wearing the monitor .
Visits 4 and 7 - Experimental visits (approximately 4 hours each)
Note: prior to coming to PSRB for the experimental visits, subjects take the oral study medication for [ADDRESS_699870] any study medication, before
beginning the same 6 week regimen of the other treatment.
In the event of an experimental failure (e.g. equipment stops working, building power outage during study visit, etc) subjects may be asked to
repeat a trial.
Experimental procedures
[ADDRESS_699871] will return
the blood pressure monitor to the investigators when they come in for the experimental visit.
Subjects will come to the CRU or 1 18 PSRB where a research nurse or approved laboratory personnel performs a blood draw (14.5 ml, < 1
Tablespoon) for substances of interest (e.g. inflammatory cytokines) and immune cell activity , and blood chemistry . The subject provides a urine
sample for the measurement of urine proteins which will be measured by [CONTACT_537393]. Then the rest of the study visit occurs in 1 18 PSRB
for the experiment (Pulse wave velocity and intradermal microdialysis).
Pulse wave velocities (PWV) on Carotid-femoral and carotid-brachial: Carotid-femoral artery PWV , the ‘gold standard’  in vivo assessment of aortic6/2/25, 9:37 AM HawkIRB
https://hawkirb.research.uiowa.edu/hawkirb/summary/projects.page?mode=pf&OID=73247426 13/[ADDRESS_699872] analysis system (AtCor Medical, Inc.) as
previously described by [CONTACT_978].45-[ADDRESS_699873] in order to calculate the transit time (t) between the foot of the carotid and the femoral
waveforms.85, 86 The carotid-femoral and carotid-brachial transit distance (CFTD) is estimated between the 2 anatomical sites as the dif ference
between the suprasternal notch (SSN) to carotid (SSN-C) and femoral (SSN-F) sites. Thus, the CFTD=(SSN-F)-(SSN-C) and PWV  calculated as
CFTD/t. This approach accounts for parallel transmission of the pulse wave up the brachiocephalic and carotid arteries, and simultaneously along
the aortic arch using the SSN as a fiducial point where parallel transmission begins (e.g., bifurcation site of aortic arch/brachiocephalic artery).
Microdialysis Probe Insertion: (NOTE: The intradermal microdialysis procedure used here is identical to the one approved in IRB #201909818)
Please see the attached "intradermal microdialysis" document for general information about intradermal microdialysis, schematic representation of
the procedure, and references. The researchers place a tight band around the forearm so they can visualize veins. For each MD site, they make pairs
of pen-marks on the arm 2.5 cm (1 inch) apart and away from veins. They remove the tight band. The MD tubing enters and exits the skin at the
marks. The researchers clean the arm with povidone iodine and alcohol, and place an ice bag on the site for 5 minutes to numb the skin. Then they
insert a thin needle into the skin at each entry mark. The needle’ s tip travels between the layers of skin for 2.5 cm (1 inch) and exits the skin at the
matching exit-mark. They thread the microdialysis tubing through the needle and then withdraw the needle leaving the tubing in the skin. Any
hyperemia related to the insertion subsides in about 60 minutes. When the hyperemia induced by [CONTACT_119180], the
experiment begins. During this time Lactated Ringer ’s perfuses the tubing. The researchers tape a fiber optic laser Doppler flowmeter probe and its
holder over each microdialysis site. The researchers control the temperature of the holders. The holders start at 33°C (91.4°F). During the
experiment, the computerized data acquisition system records heart rate, skin blood flow , and skin temperatures continuously . The researcher and/or
an automated critical care monitor measures blood pressure at 5-7 minute intervals.
Acetylcholine, Angiotensin II, and Norepi[INVESTIGATOR_537376]: The intradermal microdialysis probes are randomly numbered 1 - 4 and
assigned
to receive doses of acetylcholine with or without L-NAME (probes 1 and 2), angiotensin II (probe 3) or norepi[INVESTIGATOR_238] (probe 4).
Acetylcholine Dose Response: Microdialysis Probe 1. Lactated Ringer ’s only
Microdialysis Probe 2. Lactated Ringer ’s + L-NAME
[CONTACT_119192]: Microdialysis Probe 3. Lactated Ringer ’s only
Norepi[INVESTIGATOR_537377]: Microdialysis Probe 4. Lactated Ringer's only
When the skin blood flow is stable, the researchers perform a 10-minute baseline set of measurements. The researchers add identical concentrations
of acetylcholine to the perfusate in probes [ADDRESS_699874] concentrations,
the researchers warm the temperature controllers to 43°C (108°F) and switch perfusates at all sites to lactated Ringer ’s for about [ADDRESS_699875] may be given the pi[INVESTIGATOR_537378] 2(replacing visit 4), along with instructions for when and how to take the pi[INVESTIGATOR_119157] 5.

the repeated trial as stated above.
VIII. Risks
VIII.1 What are the risks to subjects including
- emotional or psychological
- financial
- legal or social
- physical?
Physical Risks:
Microdialysis: Intradermal microdialysis is a specialized research technique. Dr . Stanhewicz is highly skilled in this technique and has been using
the procedures in this protocol (including fiber placement, perfusate preparation, subject monitoring, and fiber removal) for over [ADDRESS_699880]. The participant may experience mild pain while the researchers remove probe. Minor bleeding may occur . As with any event
that breaks the skin, infection is possible. However , no participants in any of the researchers’  prior experiments have reported infection. In the
unlikely event in which the membrane breaks during removal leaving an isolated pi[INVESTIGATOR_288669], they treat the pi[INVESTIGATOR_537379] a manner similar to that for a splinter in the skin. In this case, trained personnel make a superficial incision for removal. Such an event
has never occurred in any projects overseen by [INVESTIGATOR_124] . Stanhewicz.
Microdialysis delivers small amounts of pharmacological substances to a nickel-sized area of the skin. Therefore there are no individual risks
associated with the drugs perfused through the fibers (acetylcholine, L-NAME, angiotensin II, norepi[INVESTIGATOR_238], SNP , lactated Ringer's). The small
quantities used and the extremely localized administration during microdialysis does not produce systemic ef fects. To the researchers’  knowledge,
there are no reports of long or short-term side ef fects of these substances administered through microdialysis. The chance of adverse reactions to
these substances is extremely small given the minute amount delivered to the a very small area of skin, the lack of adverse reactions to similar
amounts delivered via MD in many other studies, and lack of adverse ef fects in human cell cultures. There is a slight chance of aller gic reaction to
these substances that could produce redness, itching, rash, and/or swelling.
Local Heating: The local heating control unit (Moor Instruments) precisely controls and monitors the temperature of the heated probe holders used
with the Laser Doppler Flowmeter . The system has programmed maximum temperature limits. To determine the maximal SkBF , the researchers
increase the temperature of the heating units slowly (about 0.1°C every 1 second). The skin feels very warm but not painful. Local heating causes
temporary redness of the skin that subsides within several hours. This technique is very unlikely to produce long-term ill ef fects.
Povidone Iodine: Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_119160]. Participants could be aller gic to iodine. An aller gic
reaction could cause redness, itching, rash, and/or swelling. Staf f use only alcohol on participants with iodine aller gy as identified during screening.
Tape and adhesive disks: Participants could be sensitive to the adhesive of the tape, ECG electrodes, and double-sided adhesive disks used in the
study causing redness, rash, tenderness, and/or itching. The researchers remove these items carefully .
Blood draws: Potential risks associated with obtaining blood samples are minimal but include slight bruising, pain, a temporary
feeling of faintness, and/or a small risk of infection. All blood draws will be performed by a research nurse or team member trained in
drawing blood.
24-hour blood pressure measurement: There are no known or foreseeable risks associated with 24-hour blood pressure monitoring. The hourly cuf f
inflation may be disruptive to the participants activities of daily life. The cuf f may cause mild pressure discomfort when inflating.
Pulse wave velocity (PWV): There are no known or foreseeable risks associated with the use of applanation tonometry for PWV . EKG patches are
used for the monitoring and may cause minor skin irritation.
Losartan Pharmacotherapy: Losartan is a commonly prescribed hypertensive medication that works by [CONTACT_537394] [ADDRESS_699881] serious side ef fects of losartan are cold symptoms (stuf fy/runny nose, sneezing, sore
throat), mild dizziness, back pain, and diarrhea.
Injury or death of unborn babies: Losartan is classified as pregnancy category D. Studies in pregnant women have demonstrated risk to the fetus.
Pregnancy or planning to become pregnant are exclusion criteria in this study .
Low blood pressure (hypotension): Use of an anti-hypertensive medication may cause a decrease in blood pressure that leads to dizziness, faintness,
or lightheadedness, especially when going from lying down to standing up. This can be treated by [CONTACT_13635][INVESTIGATOR_56007].
For people who already have kidney problems, losartan may lead to worsening of kidney function. Abnormal kidney function is an exclusion
criteria for this study . We screen participants for markers of kidney function, and repeat those measurements (blood chemistry) at the end of each
treatment period.
Swelling in feet, ankles, or hands, or unexplained weight gain: In some patients, losartan use may lead to edema. This can be treated by [CONTACT_13635][INVESTIGATOR_537380].
Aller gic reaction: Subjects could have a mild or severe aller gic reaction including hives; dif ficult breathing; swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or
throat. We exclude subjects who have a known aller gy to losartan.
Emotional or Psychological risks: There are no foreseeable psychological risks with this study .
Social Risks: There are no foreseeable social risks with this study6/2/25, 9:37 AM HawkIRB
https://hawkirb.research.uiowa.edu/hawkirb/summary/projects.page?mode=pf&OID=73247426 15/18

participating in this research and how referral will occur if necessary (e.g. availability of emergency medical care, psychological
counseling, etc.)
Note: All investigational substances used in these protocols are used with general Physician Oversight (see attached Standard Operating Procedures
document)
Risks Associated with Losartan Treatment: Because of the risk of injury or death to unborn babies we perform a pregnancy test on all subjects
before administering losartan and council participants on the risks of becoming pregnant while taking the medication. During the study if a subject
experiences side ef fects that are life threatening, the subject will be instructed to call [ADDRESS_699883] experiences any mild but tolerable expected
side ef fects such as cold symptoms, mild dizziness, back pain, or diarrhea, they will be asked to keep a log of these including the date, the duration,
and the severity by [CONTACT_119182] a scale of 1 (mild) to 10 (severe/intolerable). If the subject feels the side ef fects are uncomfortable or intolerable, then
they will be instructed to call the Research Associate (Claire Goebel) or Dr . Stanhewicz. The Research Assistant or Dr . Stanhewicz (although she
will be blinded) will instruct the subject to skip the next dose and if the symptoms/side ef fects have resolved at time of next dose (in 24 hours), they
will be instructed to take the next dose. Dr . Stanhewicz will consult with Dr . Jalal if necessary . If symptoms do not resolve or worsen at time of next
scheduled dose, the subject will be instructed to discontinue the treatment. The subject will be withdrawn from the study procedures but will be
followed up as necessary .
Risks Associated with Intradermal Microdialysis: Research techniques are only performed by [CONTACT_119183] .
Stanhewicz to complete these procedures. Dr . Stanhewicz has [ADDRESS_699884], research personnel
constantly monitor subjects for adverse reactions (e.g. pain, itching, redness, swelling) to the microdialysis fibers or the perfusates. Participants are
never left unsupervised with the fibers in place. An automated monitor measures blood pressure every [ADDRESS_699885] left the study visit.
Risk of loss of confidentiality: The investigators collect the minimum amount of confidential data in order to complete the aims. All subjects are
assigned a code and data and specimens are collected using the code only . The only time subject names and codes appear together is on their file
which is kept in a locked cabinet in the PI's of fice. Only IRB approved personnel have access to these files. All data files are stored on password
protected computers and servers and only IRB approved personnel have access. Extensive details on how the risk of loss of confidentiality is
minimized are provided in section X. Privacy and Confidentiality .

Paper/hard copy records (hard copy surveys, questionnaires, case report forms, pi[INVESTIGATOR_499], etc.) - Most of the data are coded and do not contain
personal identifying information. Some data will temporarily contain the subject’ s name, address, and/or telephone number (Phone Interview
Form). Documents allowing identification of participants do not leave our labs and are only available to authorized persons. Only authorized
personnel may access the lab computer . Data forms containing identifiable information are shredded when no longer needed (within 5 years
after publication of results). We keep data in the laboratory in locked cabinets, the password-protected folder on the secured University of
Iowa RDSS server , and on password-protected computers maintained in locked laboratory rooms. Only authorized personnel have access.
Coded data shared with unauthorized persons cannot be traced to individuals. The list linking code numbers to participants is not shared with
unauthorized persons and destroyed when the project is completed and within [ADDRESS_699893] information
retained in the investigator ’s secured files if they wish to be considered for participation in future studies. After we complete the study , we
remove all identifiers from the data and store the data indefinitely . Individual data may be used without identifying the subject to illustrate
representative responses. Any hard paper copy of subject lists or data will be kept in a locked cabinet in the locked of fice of the PI. Subjects
will be assigned a code for the study . Files will be labeled with this code for confidentiality . Study data including laser -Doppler flowmetry
data will be stored on password protected computer hard-drives and password protected server folders which are only accessible to research
team members via password. Subject confidentiality will be maintained in all presentations and publications and information/records
pertaining to subject participation in the research project will not be released without prior authorization by [CONTACT_748].

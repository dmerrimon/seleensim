• Central corneal thickness  
• Cup-disc ratio   
• Ophthalmoscopy (dilated)  
• Heart rate and blood pressure  (BP)  
• Blood chemistry, hematology  
Duration  of study : There are a total of 6 clinical visits over 8 weeks (up to 5 weeks of washout 
and 3 weeks of study treatment) 
Statistical methods:  With a sample size in each group of 20, the study will have 80% power to detect 
a difference of 3.[ADDRESS_1182641] deviation of 3.3 mm Hg, 
α = 0.05 (two- tailed). There is no correction for multiplicity for multiple time 
points or comparisons for high or low VVN539 doses.  
 
The primary endpoint for this study is to compare mean IOP at each diurnal time point (8AM, 10AM, and 4PM) at Visit 4 (Day 7), Visit 5 (Day 14) and 
Visit 6 ( Day 21) for two doses of VVN539 compared to vehicle  using data from 
the study eye.  Time -matched longitudinal models adjusting for baseline and 
including a random effect for center will be used to test time -specific 
comparisons.  Data from Days 7, 14, and 21 will be analyzed using mixed -
model repeated measures ( MMRM) with an unstructured covariance assumed 
for each treatment with treatment, visit, and visit by [CONTACT_850701] a fixed effects, baseline measurement as a covariate, and a random effect for site. 
Sensitivity analyses include a time -matched last observation carried forward 
(LOCF) of the last available IOP measurement as well as analysis of covariance 
(ANCOVA) analyses at each visit. 
Additional sensitivity analyses will be 
performed on the PP Analysis Set as necessary.  
 
Analyses of change from baseline and observed and change from baseline for 
diurnal IOP will be performed in a manner similar to the primary efficacy 
analysis.  
 
Safety analyses will be performed on all subjects in the Safety Analysis Set. The assessment of safety will be based on the summary of ocular and non -
ocular treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs), Best Corrected Visual 
Acuity ( BCVA ), central corneal thickness, vital signs, clinical laboratory tests, 
and ophthalmic exams using slit -
lamp biomicroscopy and dilated 
ophthalmoscopy. Summaries will be provided by [CONTACT_1570], and for 
ocular assessments separately by [CONTACT_3449] -eye and non -study-eye.

VVN539 -CS-201 Protocol v2.0 1 Introduction  
1.1 Background 
A relatively new class of topi[INVESTIGATOR_850693] (ROCK) inhibitors (Kopczynski 2014). The most commonly prescribed ocular hypotensive 
medications reduce  intraocular pressure ( IOP) by [CONTACT_850702] 
(prostaglandin analogues) or decreasing aqueous humor production (ß- adrenoceptor antagonists, 
α-adrenoceptor agonists, and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors). ROCK inhibitors lower IOP through 
a different mechanism of  action, increasing aqueous outflow through the trabecular outflow 
pathway by [CONTACT_850703]- driven cellular contraction and reducing production of fibrotic 
extracellular matrix proteins (Tian  2005; Tokushige 2007; Honjo 2001; Wang  2015; Rao  2017).  
In this class of ROCK inhibitors are netarsudil (approved in the U.S. as Rhopressa® (NDA  
2085254) in 2017, and as a component of the fixed dose product, Rocklatan® (NDA  201259) in 
2019 ( Serle  2018), and ripasudil (approved in Japan in 2014 as Glanatec®, Tanihara 2015).  
VivaVision is developi[INVESTIGATOR_850694]539, a ROCK inhibitor with nanomolar potency. Upon contact 
[CONTACT_502989], it releases nitric oxide (NO) from the nitrate (ONO 2) functional group, and is 
metabolized to VIP -5156, a ROCK inhibitor with subnanomolar potency. The release of NO 
from VVN539 is a characteristic like latanoprostene bunod (approved in the U.S. as Vyzulta® in 
2017, Medeiros 2016). It has been demonstrated “NO” alone can lower the IOP by 10 -20% (2-
4 mmHg) by [CONTACT_850704] ( Cavet  2018).  
Nitric oxide released by [CONTACT_850705]539 stimulates soluble guanylate cyclase (GC), leading to an increase of cGMP in TM cells ( Torfard  1994). This leads to the relaxation of 
trabecular meshwork, a smooth muscle like tissue. In addition, NO can also alter calcium -
dependent potassium channel conductance, which leads to channel membrane activation and hyperpolarization with lower calcium ions resulting in vascular smooth muscle relaxation (Garcia- Calvo  1994).  
The IOP lowering mechanisms of action by [CONTACT_850706]. The sponsor believes that there may be synergy or additivity of NO releasing capacity and ROCK inhibition. Thus, the Sponsor suggests this molecule may provide a favorable benefit/risk profile in the lowering of elevated IOP in patients with open angle glaucoma (OAG) and ocular hypertension (OHT). 
VVN539 ophthalmic solution is a preserved multi -dose product, intended for topi[INVESTIGATOR_850695]. As a new chemical entity (NCE), the intended regulatory route is 505(b)(1).

VVN539 -CS-201 Protocol v2.0 1.2 Study  Rationale 
Please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure  (IB) for a summary of findings from the VVN539 non-
clinical studies .  
This first -in-human clinical trial with VVN539 is a phase 2 study intended to assess the  efficacy 
as well as the ocular and systemic safety of two doses of VVN539 and two dosing regimens as 
compared to vehicle control in subjects with OHT or primary open angle glaucoma (P OAG).  
1.3 Risk/Benefit Assessment  
1.3.[ADDRESS_1182651] to be  
transient, mild ocular hyperemia  (Kopczynski, 2014). Other frequent adverse events reported 
include conjunctival hemorrhage (Serle et al 2018 , Kahook et al 2019 ). 
1.3.[ADDRESS_1182652] -in-human study for VVN539. Currently 
approved treatments for OHT and POAG are often not well tolerated and / or are not sufficient for 
disease progression. As VVN539 has a different mechanism of action, it may provide an 
alternative for subjects replacing other therapeutics or acting synergistically. Subjects in this study 
contribute to the development of this new drug that may help others with OHT and POAG.  
1.3.[ADDRESS_1182653] shown a similar pattern of systemic adverse events (AEs)  as timolol, minimal 
treatment related serious AEs overall, and manageable ocular AEs (Singh, 2020) . Even though 
blood levels of VVN539 after ocular instillation  in animals have been minimal in the nonclinical 
studies to date, the Sponsor intends to conduct clinical laboratory and hematology testing at Visit 
1 (screening) and Visit 6 (end of treatment). 
Given the experience with this product in pre -clinical studies as well as with similar approved 
products used in a dry eye population, there is a favorable benefit -risk ratio. Further the risks of 
this trial will be mitigated via routine monitoring and rep orting of potential new adverse events. 
VivaVision   VVN539- CS-[ADDRESS_1182654] population.  
2.2 Study  Endpoints  
2.2.1 Primary Endpoint (s) 
The primary endpoint for this study is to compare  mean IOP at each diurnal time point (8AM, 
10AM, and 4PM) at Visit 4 (Day 7), Visit 5 (Day 14) and V isit 6 (D ay 21)  for two doses of 
VVN539 compared to vehicle . The primary statistical analysis will be performed using the data 
from the study eye. The study eye is defined as  meeting all inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria, and with the 
higher IOP at 8:00AM at Visit 2. Should both eyes have the same IOP and meet all inclusion 
criteria and no exclusion criteria, then the right eye will be the study eye. 
2.2.2 Secondary Endpoint (s) 
Secondary efficacy endpoints include: 
• Mean change from baseline (Visit 2 ) in IOP  at each diurnal time point to Visit 4 (Day 7), 
Visit 5 (Day 14) and V isit 6 (Day 21); 
• Mean change from baseline (Visit 2) in diurnal IOP to Visit 4 (Day 7), Visit 5 (Day 14) 
and Visit 6 ( Day 21) . Diurnal IOP is the average of 8AM, 10AM, and 4PM  measurements 
at a given visit.  
2.2.3 Safety Assessment s 
The safety assessments include:

VVN539 -CS-201 Protocol v2.0 3 Study Design  
3.1 Overall Design of the Study  
This is a prospective, parallel -comparison, multi -center, double -masked, randomized, vehicle -
controlled dose -response study assessing the safety and ocular hypotensive efficacy of VVN539 
in subjects with POAG or OHT . Approximately 60 s ubjects will be randomized into one of two 
active treatment arms  or a control ar m (20 subjects per cohort): 
• Arm 1: 0.02 % VVN539 ophthalmic solution  
• Arm 2: 0.04 % VVN539 ophthalmic solution  
• Arm 3: VVN539 ophthalmic solution vehicle 
Treatment assignments will be masked to VivaVision, study subjects, Investigators,  and site staff.   
The study involves 6 clinic visits, including screening, baseline, and treatment visits. The study is 
open to subjects with OHT and POAG who are either treatment -naïve or are already on ocular 
hypotensive medication. Subjects on ocular hypotensive who meet screening inclusion and do not 
meet screening exclusion criteria at Visit 1 will discontinue their prior ocular hypotensive 
medication for up to 35 days before returning to the site for Visit 2 (baseline). Treatment naïve 
subjects can return for the baseline visit as early as the day after Visit 1. Subjects meeting all baseline inclusion criteria and none of the baseline exclusion criteria will be randomized into one 
of the study arms and will return to the study site the next day for the first treatment. Three different 
dosing regimens (once a day [ q.d.] in the morning , q.d. in the evening and twice a day [b.i.d.] ) will 
be tested for 7 -9 days, each.

efficacy analysis. Data from both eyes will be used for safety analysis. The study eye will be 
defined as meeting all inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria , and with the higher IOP at  
8:00AM at  Visit 2. Should both eyes have the same IOP and meet all inclusion criteria and no 
exclusion criteria, then the right eye will be the study eye.

to respond to queries from regulatory authorities. Minimal information includes demography, 
screen failure details, elig ibility criteria, and  any serious adverse event . 
Individuals who do not meet the criteria for participation in this trial (screen failure) because of the following  may be rescreened. : 
• Prohibited medications from which the subject may discontinue for the purposes of 
eligibility and / or participating in the study (with approval from the Investigator based on 
clinical safety).

Starting the day after Visit 5, subjects will self -administer the IP b.i.d ( suggested timing between 
7:00AM and 9:00AM  for the morning dose and between 7:00PM and 9:00PM for the evening 
dose) each day for [ADDRESS_1182669] morning dose will be 
administered in clinic after the 8:00AM IOP dose has been measured. Subjects will return the IP 
at Visit [ADDRESS_1182670] of care treatment.  
Subjects should be instructed to administer missed doses as soon as possible, as long as it is not administered within 12 hours of the next scheduled dosing during the q.d. dosing periods or not 
within 4 hours of the next scheduled dosing during the b.i.d dosing period. Missed doses will be 
recorded as deviations in the electronic case report form (eCRF).  
5.2 Preparation/Storage/Handling/Accountability  
5.2.1 Acquisition and Accountability  
VVN539 ophthalmic solution and vehicle will be provided to study sites in identical bottles so that 
masking is maintained. Shipment records will be verified by [CONTACT_850708]. Accurate records of receipt and disposition of the 
IP (e.g. dates, quantity, subject number, date dispensed, date returned) must be maintained by [CONTACT_3452]. At the end of the study, all used and unused IP will be returned to VivaVision ( or 
designee), following approval by [CONTACT_850709]. The study monitor (or designee) will verify IP 
accountability prior to return of the IP. All accountability procedures must be completed before the study is complete or before the study site is closed, whichever comes first.  
5.2.[ADDRESS_1182671] Packaging and Labeling  
Each randomization kit contains one dropper bottle of IP sufficient for 14- 18 days of q.d. and 7- 9 
days of b.i.d. dosing. Double masked labels will minimally contain the following information:  
• Protocol number 
• Sponsor’s name  
• Kit number 
• Instructions for use  
• Storage temperature  
• Required statement(s) per regulatory agency  
VivaVision   VVN539- CS-[ADDRESS_1182672] Storage and Stability  
IP and active comparator should be stored at controlled refrigerated temperatures from 2°C to 8°C 
and protected from light. Once dispensed to the subject, IP bottles may be stored by [CONTACT_850710] (approximately 2-8°C/ 35-46°F)  or at ambient room temperature until use . 
5.3 Measures to Minimize Bias: Randomization and Blinding  
Subjects will be randomized to a treatment assignment. A randomization schedule will be 
generated by [CONTACT_850711] a secure and limited -access location separate from the Investigators and members 
of the project team.  Treatment will not be blocked by [CONTACT_850712]. Treatment assignments will be masked to the Sponsor, subjects, Investigators, and investigative staff, until completion of the study and the final database is locked. 
Appropriate precautions will be taken to prevent unauthorized access to the randomization scheme.  
Both doses of VVN ophthalmic solution as well as vehicle will be provided in identical dropper 
bottles to prevent inadvertent unmasking. If unmasking is required, the integrity of the study 
assessments and objectives will be maintained by [CONTACT_558678].  Unless the 
subject’s safety requires otherwise and if time permits, the decision to unmask an individual subject’s treatment assignment is to be made jointly by [CONTACT_850713], thus leaving the masking of the remaining subjects intact.  
5.[ADDRESS_1182673] has taken 2 months prior to Visit 1 and / or is taking through Visit 
6 (or discontinuation from the study) will be recorded in the subject chart and the eCRF. The 
generic name [CONTACT_18467], dose, route of administration, duration of treatment (including start and stop dates), frequency, indication and whether or not the medication was taken due to an AE will 
be recorded for each medication. 
For this protocol, a prescription medication is defined as a medication that can be prescribed only 
by a properly authorized/licensed clinician. Medications to be reported in the c ase report form are 
concomitant prescription medications, over- the-counter medications and supplements.

Rescued subjects will be considered as treatment failures, and the need for rescue therapy will not be considered an adverse event (AE). Rescued subjects will stop the investigational product and 
should not be withdrawn from the study. 
The following guidance is provided to Investigators for rescue and the decision to rescue is at the 
discretion of the investigator’s judgement:  
• Ocular hypotensive medication (other than IP) is prohibited during study participation unless the subject is rescued.  
• If the subject’s IOP is > 36 mm HG, the Investigator may recheck the IOP within 3 day of the visit and rescue medication may be considered if the IOP remains elevated  
• Rescued subjects should discontinue the investigational product. 
• Rescued subjects should continue in the study for safety follow -up after receiving the 
rescue medication.

6.[ADDRESS_1182677].  
6.2 Subjects Discontinuation/ Withdrawal from the Study  
Subjects are free to withdraw from participation in the study at any time upon request. An 
Investigator may discontinue or withdraw a subject from the study for the following reasons:  
• IOP measurement of 36 mmHg or higher in either eye  
• Severe ocular irritation, burning, pain, or hyperemia 
• Study terminated by [CONTACT_1034], Food and Drug Administration ( FDA) , or other 
regulatory authorities  
• Any woman who becomes pregnant while participating in the study. Information on the 
pregnancy and outcome will be requested. 
• Significant study treatment/intervention non-compliance  
• If any clinical adverse event , laboratory abnormality, or other medical condition or 
situation occurs such that continued participation in the study would not be in the best interest of the subject 
• Disease progression which requires discontinuation of the study intervention 
• If the subject  meets an exclusion criterion (either newly developed or not previously 
recognized) that precludes further study participation  
The reason for subject discontinuation or withdrawal from the study will be recorded on the c ase 
report form. Subjects who sign the informed consent form and are randomized but do not receive 
the study intervention may be replaced. Those who sign the informed consent form, and are 
randomized and receive the study treatment , and subsequently withdraw, or are withdrawn or 
discontinued from the study, will not be replaced.    
Additionally, the trial or parts of the trial may be discontinued by [CONTACT_850714], Inc. This may be 
based on a significant number of AEs of a similar nature that warrant such action. 
In the event study discontinuation of a randomized subject is necessary, the Investigator should 
make every attempt to have the subject complete all Visit [ADDRESS_1182678]'s final study visit, an effort will be made to follow up until 
VivaVision   VVN539- CS-[ADDRESS_1182679] fails to return to the clinic for a required study 
visit:  
• The site will attempt to contact [CONTACT_850715] 1-[ADDRESS_1182680] wishes to and/or should continue in the study. Subjects should 
continue the current dosing regimen until the rescheduled visit. 
• Before a subject  is deemed lost to follow -up, the Investigator or designee will make every 
effort to regain contact [CONTACT_1155]  (where possible, [ADDRESS_1182681] ’s last known mailing address or local equivalent methods). 
These contact [CONTACT_9300] ’s medical record or study file . 
• Should the subject continue to be unreachable, he or she will be considered to have 
withdrawn from the study with a primary reason of lost to follow -up.   
 
VivaVision   VVN539- CS-[ADDRESS_1182682] (HIPAA) 
authorization will be obtained from all subjects prior to any study- related procedures being 
performed.  The Schedule of Procedures and Assessments ( Appendix 1) lists the procedures that

VVN539 -CS-201 Protocol v2.0 8 Study Assessments  
The Schedule of Procedures and Assessments (Appendix 1) provides a list of study assessments 
and evaluations to be performed and the timing of each.   
8.1 Efficacy Evaluations  
Efficacy assessments will be conducted at the time points indicated on the Schedule of Procedures 
and Assessments (Appendix 1) and as detailed in the sections below.   
8.1.1 IOP 
IOP will be measured per the instructions in Appendix 5. 
8.2 Safety Evaluations 
Safety assessments will be performed at the time points indicated on the Schedule of Procedures 
and Assessments (Appendix 1) and as detailed in the sections below.   
• AE monitoring 
• BCVA ( Appendix 3) 
• Slit-Lamp Biomicroscopy ( Appendix 4)

• Dilated o phthalmoscopy ( Appendix 6 ) 
• Vital signs (h eart rate and blood pressure) ( Appendix 12) 
• Clinical laboratory tests  (blood chemistry, hematology) ( Appendix 11) 
8.2.1 Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)  
AEs will be monitored throughout the study.  Subject s will be encouraged to report any adverse 
findings during the study  whether or not they are related to IP. These can be collected either in an 
unsolicited fashion without any prompting or in response to a general question such as : “Have you 
noticed anything different since you started the study; began the IP , etc?”  
All AEs will be captured on the appropriate eCRF .  Information to be collected at minimum 
includes event description, onset, assessment of severity , relationship to IP , and outcome.  
The Investigator will record all AEs  with start dates occurring any time after informed consent is 
obtained until 7 (for nonserious AEs) or 30 days (for SAEs) after the last day of study participation. 
At each study visit, the I nvestigator will inquire about the occurrence of AE/SAEs since the last 
visit. Events will be followed for outcome information until resolution or stabilization.  
VivaVision   VVN539- CS-[ADDRESS_1182696] ’s condition deteriorates at any 
time during the study, it will be recorded as an AE.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Definitions  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical study subject , temporally 
associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study  
intervention.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use 
of study intervention. 
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “ serious ” if, in the view of either the 
Investigator or Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death,  
• A life -threatening AE ,  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081],  
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions, or  
• A congenital anomaly or birth defect.  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6721], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize 
the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed 
in this definition.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Classification of Adverse Events  
Severity of Adverse Events  
The severity of all AEs will be assessed by [CONTACT_558683]:  
• Mild: requires minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the  subject ’s daily 
activities;  
• Moderate:  result s in a low level of inconvenience or concern and may cause some 
interference with functioning ; 
• Severe: interrupts a subject ’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug therapy 
or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life -threatening or incapacitating. 
The term “severe” does not necessarily equate to “serious”.   
Relationship of Adverse Events 
VivaVision   VVN539- CS-[ADDRESS_1182697]  based on temporal relationship and his/her clinical judgment. 
The degree of certainty about causality will be graded using the categories below. In a clinical 
study, the IP must always be suspect.  
• Unrelated:  no reasonable possibility that the administration of the IP c aused the event, no 
temporal relationship between the IP  and event onset, or an alternate etiology has been 
established . 
• Related:  is known to occur with the IP , is a reasonable possibility that the IP  caused the 
AE, or there is a temporal relationship between the IP  and event. Reasonable possibility 
means that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the IP and the AE. 
Expectedness 
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the 
Investigator’s Brochure (IB) , package insert, or device labeling or is not listed at the specificity or 
severity that has been observed; or, if an IB is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk information described in the protocol, as amended. “Unexpected,” as used in this definition, 
also refers to AEs or suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned in the IB, package insert, or device labeling as  occurring with a class of drugs (or other medical products) or as anticipated 
from the pharmacological properties or other characteristics of the IP , but are not specifically 
mentioned as occurring with the particular IP under investigation. 
The Investigator will be responsible for determining whether an AE  is unexpected, i.e., if the 
nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with the risk information previously 
described for the IP .   
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event Reporting  Requirements  
According to federal regulations, a n Investigator must immediately  (within 24 hours)  report to the 
Sponsor or a designee  any SAE , whether or not considered drug related, including those listed in 
the protocol or IB and must include an assessment of whether there is a reasonable possibility that 
the drug caused the event.  
According to federal regulations, the S ponsor must notify the FDA and all participating 
Investigators as soon as possible, but in no case later than [ADDRESS_1182698] a causal 
relationship between the drug and the adverse event (See 21 CFR 312.32(c)(1)).  
VivaVision   VVN539- CS-[ADDRESS_1182699] also notify FDA of any unexpected fatal or life -threatening 
suspected adverse reaction as soon as possible but in no case later than 7 calendar days after the 
Sponsor's initial receipt of the information  (See 21 CFR 312.32(c)(2) ). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancy  
All pregnancies are to be reported from the time informed consent is signed until [ADDRESS_1182700] 
be withdrawn from the study. 
Every effort should be made to gather information regarding the pregnancy outcome and condition 
of the infant. It is the responsibility of the I nvestigator to obtain this information within 30 calendar 
days after the initial notification and approximately 30 calendar days after delivery. 
Pregnancy complications such as spontaneous abortion/miscarriage or congenital abnormality are 
considered SAEs and must be reported to the Sponsor or its delegate using the Serious Adverse 
Event Form. Note : An elective abortion is not considered an SAE. 
In addition to the above, if the Investigator determines that the pregnancy meets serious criteria, it 
must be reported as an SAE to the Sponsor or its delegate.

efficacy endpoints as the primary analysis.  
The Per Protocol (PP) Analysis Set will include all subjects who completed study-required treatment and who followed the protocol without significant deviations. The determination of 
significant protocol violations will be made prior to locking the final d atabase and unmasking. 
Subjects will be analyzed in the group to which they were randomized.  
The Safety Analysis Set will include all subjects who took at least one dose of investigational 
product as indicated on the dosing record. Subjects will be analyzed in the group according to the 
treatment received. All safety variables will be analyzed usi ng the Safety Analysis Set and only 
observed data will be included (i.e., missing data will remain missing for the safety analysis).

subjects, protocol deviations, and subjects excluded from the analysis sets will be provided as well.  
Exposure and compliance to study treatment will be summarized by [CONTACT_11763]. 
9.4.2 Efficacy Analyses 
Efficacy analyses will be based on the study eye using the FAS.  [IP_ADDRESS] Primary Efficacy Analyses 
Primary Estimands: The primary estimands are the treatment differences between VVN539  and 
vehicle at 8:00 AM, 10:00 AM, and 4:00 PM at each of Days 7 , 14, and 21 in the study eye using 
the FAS. The primary estimands treat subjects as if they do not receive rescue/prohibited therapy.  
Target Population : Subjects with open -angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension that meet the 
study entry criteria.  
Endpoint : Observed  IOP measurements at each time point in the study eye.  
Treatment Condition(s): Treatment condition is based on the randomized treatment group.  
Population- level Summaries: The difference in the mean IOP at the nine time points of interest 
and their corresponding p- values and 95% confidence intervals.

what frequency monitoring will be done, at what level of detail monitoring will be performed and 
the distribution of monitoring reports. 
10.1.6 Quality Assurance and Quality Control  
Quality control (QC) procedures will be implemented beginning with the data entry system and 
data QC checks that will be run on the database will be generated. Any missing data or data 
anomalies will be communicated to the site(s) for clarification/resolut ion.   
Following written Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), the monitors will verify that the clinical trial is conducted and data are generated and biological specimens are collected, documented 
(recorded), and reported in compliance with the protocol, International Council for Harmonisation 
(ICH) Good Clinical Practice (GCP ), and applicable regulatory requirements (e.g., Good 
Laboratory Practice [GLP],  Good Manufacturing Practices [ GMP ]).   
The investigational site will provide direct access to all trial related sites, source data/documents, 
and reports for the purpose of monitoring and auditing by [CONTACT_941] S ponsor, and inspection by [CONTACT_21229].

[IP_ADDRESS] Data Collection  and Management Responsibilities  
Data collection is the responsibility of the clinical trial staff at the site under the supervision of the site’s  Investigator. The I nvestigator is responsible for ensuring the accuracy, completeness, 
legibility, and timeliness of the data reported.    
All source documents should be completed in a neat, legible manner to insure accurate 
interpretation of data. Data recorded in the eCRF derived from source documents should be consistent with the data recorded on the source documents.    
Clinical data (including AEs, concomitant medications, and expected adverse reactions data) will be entered into IBM Clinical Development, a [ADDRESS_1182711] protection and

VVN539 -CS-201 Protocol v2.0 internal quality checks, such as automatic range checks, to identify data that appear inconsistent, 
incomplete, or inaccurate. Clinical data will be entered directly from the source documents.    
[IP_ADDRESS] Study Records Retention  
Study documents should be retained for a minimum of [ADDRESS_1182712] elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical 
development of the study intervention. These documents should be retained for a longer period, 
however, if required by [CONTACT_427]. No records will be destroyed without the written consent 
of the Sponsor , if applicable. It is the responsibility of the Sponsor to inform the Investigator when 
these documents no longer need to be retained.   
10.1.8 Protocol Deviations 
A protocol deviation is any noncompliance with the clinical trial protocol, ICH GCP, or Manual 
of Procedures (MOP) requirements. The noncompliance may be either on the part of the subject , 
the I nvestigator , or the study site staff. As a result of deviations, corrective actions are to be 
developed by [CONTACT_3483].   
These practices are consistent with ICH GCP:   
• 4.5 Compliance with Protocol, sections 4.5.1, 4.5.2, and 4.5.3  
• 5.1 Quality Assurance and Quality Control, section 5.1.1  
• 5.20 Noncompliance, sections 5.20.1, and 5.20.2. 
It is the responsibility of the site ’s Investigator to use continuous vigilance to identify and report 
deviations. All deviations must be addressed in study source documents, reported to the  reviewing  
IRB (as applicable per the IRB policies ), the Contract Research Organization and/or Sponsor. The 
site Investigator is responsible for knowing and adhering to the reviewing IRB requirements.  
Further details about the handling of protocol deviations will be included in the MOP.   10.1.[ADDRESS_1182713] no right to publish or present the results of this study without the prior written consent of the Sponsor.

VVN539 -CS-201 Protocol v2.0 12.3 Appendix 3 : Visual Acuity  
Distance visual acuity (VA) will be assessed as outlined in Appendix 1 using ETDRS visual acuity 
charts either retro -illuminated or frontally illuminated (60 -watt bulb or well -lit room, respectively). 
It is recommended that the ETDRS Chart [ADDRESS_1182718]'s prescription eyeglasses for distance correction, 
provided the prescription is less than one year old. Sites should measure the eyeglasses and record 
the readings at Visit [ADDRESS_1182719]'s eyeglass prescription is more than one year old or if the subject forgets to bring their eyeglasses to Visit 1. 
This refraction should then be used for all following visits.  
12.3.[ADDRESS_1182720] should be positioned according to the elevation of the chart (either seated or standing) 
so that the chart is at a comfortable viewing angle. The subject should attempt to read each letter, 
line-by-line, left to right, beginning with line [ADDRESS_1182721] be accepted.  
Maximum effort should be made to identify each letter on the chart; the subject should be encouraged to guess. When it becomes evident that no further meaningful readings can be made, 
the examiner should stop the test. The number of letters missed or read incorrectly should be noted. 
In order to provide standardized and well -controlled assessments of visual acuity during the study, 
the same lighting conditions must be used consistently throughout the study

VVN539 -CS-201 Protocol v2.0 Calculations: LogMAR VA = Baseline value + (n x 0.02)  
• where:   the baseline value is the LogMAR number of the last line read (at least 1 letter read 
correctly in this line), and “n” is the total number of letters missed up to and including the 
last line read, and “0.02” is the value for each letter.  
12.4 Appendix 4 : Biomicroscopy 
The slit -lamp biomicroscopy exam will be performed to examine eye structures at each study visit 
for each eye. Areas assessed will include the following: anterior chamber, eyelids, conjunctiva, cornea, iris, pupi[INVESTIGATOR_8324], lashes and lens.  
Note : the same Investigator should assess and score anterior chamber cells and flare across all 
study visits for an individual subject. 
It should be performed with a slit lamp (halogen illumination system is required) using a beam width and intensity that provide optimal evaluation of the anterior segment.  
This procedure will be performed in the same manner for all subjects observed at the Investigator’s 
site. The site will record all ABNORMAL findings in the source document and the Investigator 
will evaluate the ABNORMAL findings as Not Clinically Significant (NCS) or Clinically 
Significant (CS). CS and NCS ABNORMAL findings will be recorded in the source 
documentation. However, only ABNORMAL CS descriptions from Visits 3-6 will be captured in 
the eCRF as AE.  
The scoring scales below will be used:  
Anterior Chamber Cells  
 0 = No cells seen  
1 = 1 - 5 cells  
2 = 6 - 15 cells  
3 = 16 - 30 cells  
4 = greater than 30 cells  
Anterior Chamber Flare  0 = None  
1 = Mild (trace to clearly noticeable, visible)  
2 = Moderate (without plastic aqueous humor)  
3 = Marked (with plastic aqueous humor)  
4 = Severe (with fibrin deposits and/or clots)

12.5 Appendix 5 : Intraocular Pressure  
IOP measurement should be conducted after the biomicroscopy exam is completed and prior to 
pupil dilation, as applicable.   
IOP measurements will be performed utilizing a Goldmann applanation tonometer affixed to a slit 
lamp according to the Investigator’s standard procedure ( two-person reading method). 
Measurements will be taken with the subject seated. The subject and slit lamp should be adjusted 
so that the subject’s head is firmly positioned on the chin rest and against the forehead rest without 
leaning forward or straining. All pressure will be recorded in mmHg. Two consecutive 
measurements are taken in each eye and recorded as the mean of the two measurements. If the two 
measurements differ by >1.[ADDRESS_1182722] measurement is performed,  and the median is 
recorded.  
At Visit 1, IOP will be measured once during screening visit. 
At Visit 3, IOP will be measured once at  8:00AM (±30 minutes)  prior to the first q.d. AM dosing.  
At Visits 2, 4, 5, and 6 diurnal IOP will be measured:  
• At 8:00AM (±30 minutes), 10:00AM (±30 minutes) and 4:00PM (±30 minutes) 
• At Visits 4 and 6, the 8:00AM measurement will be taken prior to the AM dosing.  
12.6 Appendix 6 : Dilated Ophthalmoscopy  
Dilated ophthalmoscopy will include assessment of the retina for any abnormal findings, optic 
nerve head for pallor and cuppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (cup to disc ratio) for each eye. The status of the vitreous

VVN539 -CS-201 Protocol v2.0 (including haze), retina (including vessels), macula, optic nerve will be determined as Normal or 
Abnormal. The cup- to-disc ratio will be recorded with two decimal points (e.g., 0.80). After the 
Ophthalmoscopy procedure, the Investigator will determine if findings are within normal limits or are abnormal. For abnormal findings at Visit 1, the Investigator will determine whether or not the 
abnormality would exclude the subject from study participation. 
12.7 Appendix 7 : Pachymetry  
Corneal thickness evaluation (in microns) will be performed using a calibrated ultrasonic or optical 
pachymeter , provided that the same method is used for all measurements. Measurements will be 
taken in the central cornea after instilling topi[INVESTIGATOR_15413]. A total of three readings will be obtained for each eye. Care should be taken to place the probe perpendicular to the corneal surface 
and to not a compress the cornea. 
Pachymetry is performed  at Visit 1 and Visit 6 .  
• At Visit 1, pachymetry  within 3 months of the visit is acceptable.  
• At Visit 6, Pachymetry is to be performed after the last IOP measurement.  
12.8 Appendix  8: Gonioscopy 
Gonioscopy will be  performed at Visit 1  using the Shaffer system  (Shaffer, 1960)  to grade the 
angle anatomy as follows:  
Angle  Grade  
closed  0 
10 – 15o I 
15 – 25o II

• Visual fields  performed within 3 months of Visit 1 are  acceptable.  
12.10 Appendix 10: Optical Coherence Tomography  (OCT)  
OCT will be used at the screening visit to determine the nerve fiber layer thickness  at Visit 1 . 
12.11 Appendix 11 : Blood Chemistry, Hematology 
Laboratory requisition forms must be completed, and samples must be clearly labelled with the 
subject number, protocol number, site/center number and visit date. Refer to the Central Laboratory Manual for details for the collection, preparation and shipment of samples and reference ranges.  
Laboratory reports must be reviewed and signed by [CONTACT_377620] [ADDRESS_1182724] be performed and 
results reviewed by [CONTACT_377620] 2 . 
Approximately 10 mL of blood will be obtained at Visit 1 and Visit 6 . Fasting will not be 
required, therefore specific values may be out of the typi[INVESTIGATOR_748924].  
Abnormal laboratory values noted as clinically significant at Visit 6  that are changes from the

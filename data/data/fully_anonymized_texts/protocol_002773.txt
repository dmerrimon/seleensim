ProKidney Renal Autologous Cell Therapy (REACT)  REGEN -003 v1.7 
Confidential  Page 3 12 January  2021  
   PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
Title: A PHASE II, OPEN -LABEL SAFETY AND TOLERABILITY STUDY OF A 
RENAL AUTOLOGOUS CELL THERAPY  (REACT)  IN PATIENTS WITH  
TYPE 2 DIABETES AND CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE (REGEN -003) 
Therapeutic Product:   REACT  is made from expanded autologous selected renal cells 
(SRC) obtained from each individual subject’s kidney biopsy. To manufacture REACT , 
kidney biopsy tissue from each enrolled subject will be sent to ProKidney , where renal cells 
will be expanded and SRC selected. SRC will be formulated in a gelatin -based  hydrogel at a 
concentration of 100 x 106 cells/mL, packaged in a 10 mL syringe, and shipped to the 
clinical site for use.  
Study Objectives:  
Primary Objective: The primary objective of the study is to assess the safety of 
REACT  injected in one recipi[INVESTIGATOR_622495]. 
• Primary Outcome Measures:  procedure and/or product related ad verse events 
(AEs) through [ADDRESS_828851]- injection.  
Secondary Objective: The secondary objective of the study is to assess the safety and 
tolerability of REACT  administration by [CONTACT_622519]- specific AEs over a 24-month 
period following injection. 
• Secondary Outcome Measures:  renal -specific laboratory assessments through [ADDRESS_828852]- injection.  
Exploratory Objective: Exploratory objectives of the study are designed to assess the 
impact of REACT  on renal function over a 24- month  period following injection and on the 
Quality of Life.  
• Exploratory Outcome Measures: 1) clinical diagnos tic and laboratory 
assessments  of renal structure and function (including eGFR, serum creatinine, 
and proteinuria) to assess changes in the rate of progression of renal disease, 2)  
patient -reported outcomes from the Kidney Disease Quality of Life (KDQOL) 
and EQ-5D-5L surveys obtained at baseline (i.e., after randomization, but bef ore 
REACT  injection) through [ADDRESS_828853]  injection.  
Study Design: Multi -center, prospective, open- label, single -group study. All subjects will 
be treated with two REACT  injections 6 months (+4 weeks) apart after biopsy. 
Randomization: Open -label, non-randomized. 
Control Group: Each subject will serve as his or her own control; the patient’s previous 
medical history, which must include a minimum 6-month period of observation of renal 
function, will serve as the control for rate of progression of renal insufficienc y. 
Sample Size:  Up to [ADDRESS_828854] statistical analysis will not be performed. Therefore, the sa mple size proposed for this 
study is a size typi[INVESTIGATOR_622496] 1 studies, allowing for identification of saf ety outcomes in 
a limited population.  
Study Population:  Male or female patients 30 to 65 years of age with CKD and eGFR  
between 14 and 20 mL/min/1.73m2. Patients should have sufficient historical clinical data to 
determine their individual rate of CKD disease progression.

jeopardized by [CONTACT_6231]. 
26. The subject has used an investigational product within [ADDRESS_828865]  
injection without receiving written consent from the Medical Monitor. 
Number of Sites :  Up to 10 clinical centers will be included in the study.  
Study Duration : treatment to begin as soon as the REACT  product is made available and 
assuming a one-month interval prior to receiving the first REACT  injection, and assuming a 
6-month interval before receiving the second injection, plus a 24 month follow up peri od 
after the final injection, the duration of treatment would be: 
- [ADDRESS_828866]  injections  
Study Enrollment : up to 10 subjects will be enrolled into the study. Patients who complete 
screening procedures satisfying all I/E criteria will be e nrolled into the study immediately 
prior to the biopsy.  Patients who do not meet all criteria before the biop sy is taken will be 
considered screen failures.  Patients who have a biopsy but are not injected f or whatever 
reason will be discontinued from the study and may be replaced. Once a patient ha s been 
injected, the patient will have completed treatment and every  effort should be made to 
ensure the patient completes all follow -up visits. 
Investigational Plan : 
Screening : Subjects who satisfy eligibility criteria and provide writte n informed consent 
may be entered into the study. The subject should have adequate, historical clinical data to 
provide a reasonable estimate of the rate of progression of CKD (re: Inc lusion 7). Screening 
procedures include a full physical exam, ECG, and laboratory assessments (hem atology, 
clinical chemistry, and urinalysis). An ultrasound will be performed to confirm  the presence 
of two kidneys with normal anatomic features. A MRI study will determine kidney size a nd 
volume. 
Renal Biopsy :  Three days or less before undergoing renal biopsy, enrolled subjects will 
report to the clinic and undergo an interim physical exam along with an ECG and renal MRI  
(if not completed during or after the Screening Visit). Laboratory tests, includi ng renal 
ProKidney Renal Autologous Cell Therapy (REACT)  REGEN -[ADDRESS_828867] for females will also be perform ed. Eligible 
subjects satisfying all inclusions and exclusion criteria will be  admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]  / 
clinical research center to undergo a kidney biopsy. A minimum of [ADDRESS_828868]’s kidney biopsy tissue will be sent to ProKidney. 
REACT  Injection :  Ten to 14 days before the scheduled injection date, subjects will 
undergo an interim physical exam for ongoing verification of inclusion and exclusion 
criteria. Subjects also will undergo renal scintigraphy ( i.e., split kidney function scan) to 
find out what percentage each kidney contributes to total baseline kidney function. O n the 
day of the scheduled REACT  injection, eligible subjects will be admitted into the hospit al / 
clinical research unit. After warming to liquefy the hydrogel, REACT  will be injecte d into 
the same kidney that was previously biopsied using a percutaneous approach. This 
procedure will follow a standardized technique, such as that used in the ablation of rena l 
masses by [CONTACT_622521]. Subjects without complications may be 
discharged the same day consistent with site standard practice. An ultrasound wi ll be 
performed the day after injection to detect possible, subclin ical AEs. It is anticipated that all 
subjects will receive [ADDRESS_828869]  injections given 6 months (+4 week s) apart. The first and 
second injections will occur in the same kidney in which the biopsy was taken. Therefore,  
only one kidney will be used for the duration of this study. 
Follow- up: Subjects will complete follow -up evaluations on Days 1, 7, 14, 28 (± 3 days) 
and Months 2, 3, 4 and 5 (± 7 days) after the first REACT  injection , and on Days 1, 7, 14, 
28 (± 3 days) and Months 2 and 3 (± 7 days) after the second  REACT  injection . Depending 
on when the second injection is administered ( i.e., at 6 months [+4 w eeks]), subjects may 
undergo evaluations at [ADDRESS_828870]- treatment.  
Safety Monitoring :  Hemorrhage following REACT  injection is a known and foreseeable 
risk to subjects participating in this study. Therefore, hemoglobin will be me asured by [CONTACT_39722]’s local laboratory at the following times: a) before, b) after procedure per site standard 
practice . 
  Investigational Product, Dosage and Mode of Administration: 
Investigational Product:  REACT  is made from expanded autologous selected renal cells 
obtained from each individual subject’s kidney biopsy. To manufacture REACT , biopsy 
tissue from each enrolled subject will be sent to ProKidney , in whose facilities renal cells 
will be expanded and SRC selected. SRC will be formulated in a gelatin -based hydrogel at 
a concentration of 100 x 106 cells/mL, packaged in a 10 mL syringe, and shipped to the 
clinical site.  
Dosage: The volume of REACT  to be administered will be determined by [CONTACT_094]- procedure 
MRI vo lumetric 3D evaluation or ellipsoid formula (Length x width AP plane x width 
Transverse plan x .62). Based on pre- clinical data, the dose of REACT  will be 3  x 106 
cells/g estimated kidney weight (g KWest). Since the concentration of SRC per mL of 
REACT  is 100 x 106 cells/mL, the dosing volume will be 3.[ADDRESS_828871]  injected into the biopsied kidney will be 8.0 mL.

Investigational Product, Dosage and Mode of Administration:  Dosage (continued)  
It is anticipated that all subjects will receive two p lanned REACT  injections to allow dose- 
finding and evaluate the duration of effects. The first and second injections will oc cur in the 
same kidney in which the biopsy was taken. In some cases, a subject or the Investiga tor may 
decide to postpone or withhold the second REACT  injection. For example, if there appears 
to be any untoward safety risk, or rapid deterioration of renal function, or the development 
of uncontrolled diabetes or uncontrolled hypertension, or the development of a malignancy 
or an  intercurrent infection, then the second REACT  injection should not be administered. 
Mode of Administration:  REACT  will be inject ed into the biopsied kidney using a 
percutaneous approach. The percutaneous method will employ a standardized technique 
(such as that utilized in the ablation of renal masses by [CONTACT_622522]).  
Data Safety Monitoring Board:  A Data S afety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be 
chartered to oversee subject safety, especially as it rel ates to unexpected investigational  
product- related events. The DSMB will minimally consist of [ADDRESS_828872] enrollment and t he 
amount of new data generated. The DSMB will advise ProKidney on aspects concerning the 
safety of subjects participating in the clinical trial. Apart from reviewi ng study data, the 
DSMB will consider feedback from the Sponsor and Investigators. The DSMB will s hare its 
recomme ndations with the study centers, Institutional Review Boards/Et hics Committees,  
and regulatory authorities, as appropriate. Other specific activities and resp onsibilities of the 
DSMB will be detailed in the DSMB charter.

Notes:  
* Day 1 follow -up visit should only be conducted if there is a saf ety event identified during or after the kidney bio psy. 
**Every attempt should be made to ensure the second REACT  injection is administered 6 months (+4 weeks) after  the first injection . In the event that the subject  cannot schedule  
his/her second REACT  injection [ADDRESS_828876] injection or  cannot keep his/her scheduled  6-month visit, ProKidney  and the Medical Monitor must be 
notified  immediately. The expectation is that the subject an d the clinical center will accommodate the Sponsor’ s preference that the series of [ADDRESS_828877]  injections should be 
administered no  more than 6 months apart.  
a. If the screening assessment falls outside of the 60 -day window before renal biopsy, re -screening will be performed as described in Screeni ng (Section  6.1). 
b. Because the second REACT  injection will occur 6 months (+ 4 weeks) after the first injection, the [ADDRESS_828878] is terminated from t he study by [CONTACT_737] ( Section  8.6) or when the 
subject  voluntarily discontinues from the study ( Section  5.4). 
e. The Informed Consent Form must be signed and dated prior to conducting any study -specific procedures, including those at the Sc reening Visit.  Signing the Informed Consent 
Form starts the 60-day timeline for screening.  
f. The PE and interim PE are described in Section  7.2.2 . 
g. Vital signs include heart rate, resting blood press ure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], and body temperature. ( Section  7.2.1 ). At the Pre -Biopsy Visit (Day -3 to Day -1) and the Pre -Injection Visit 
(Day -14 to Day -10) three BP measurements will be taken and the ave rage will be used to satisfy entry criteria.  
h. Vital signs (included are heart rate, blood pressur e, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487]) will be measured throughou t the procedure. Temperature is not required to be recorded throughout the 
procedure.  
i. Refer to  Table  [ADDRESS_828879]  injection(s) on Day [ADDRESS_828880]  injection, and at the month 24/EOS Visit.  
n. The REACT  preparation will be handled and injected according to procedures described in the Study Reference Manu al. 
o. CT Scan must be used in conjunction with ultrasound for the REACT  injection procedure.  
p. Subjects may be admitted to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_622498]. Subjects who do not experience compli cations may be discharg ed the same day consistent with site standar d 
practice.  
q. Subjects will undergo a funduscopic exam with retin al photography of both retinae to monitor diabetic retinopathy at screening, month 12, and month 24/EO S visit.

**Every attempt should be made to ensure the second REACT  injection is administered 6 months (+ 4 weeks) afte r the first injection . In the event that the subject cannot schedule
his/her second REACT  injectio n [ADDRESS_828884] injection, or cann ot keep his/her scheduled 6-month visit, ProKidney  and the Medical Monitor must be 
notified  immediately. The expectation is that the subject an d the clinical center will accommodate the Sponsor’ s preference that the series of [ADDRESS_828885]  injections should be 
administered no  more than 6 months apart.  
a.If the screening  assessment  falls outside of  the 60 -day window  before renal  biopsy,  re-screening will  be performed as  described in Screening  (Section  6.1).
b.Because the second  REACT  injection  will occur  6 months  (+4 weeks)  after the first injection,  the 6-month visit  may not be scheduled.
c.In the  event that a second REACT  injection  will not be  administered,  the subject will undergo  all follow -up assessments  after the last  REACT  inject ion at  the 24-month EOS 
Visit.
d.The EOS Visit will take  place [ADDRESS_828886]  is terminated from  the study by [CONTACT_16032]  (Section  8.6), or when the

1. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
1.1. Chronic Kidney Disease  
1.1.1.  Background 
Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is characterized by [CONTACT_622524] t hat without 
therapeutic intervention will worsen until the patient reac hes end stage renal disease (ESRD). It  is 
defined as reduced kidney function, demonstrated by [CONTACT_622525] 
(eGFR) or evidence of kidney damage, such as increased exc retion of urinary albumin. Global 
prevalence of CKD is estimated at 8 -16% .1  CKD is associated with considerable morbidity, such as 
diabetes mellitus ,2 and is often accompanied by [CONTACT_622526]/or risk factors such as hypertension and renovascular disease .[ADDRESS_828901] ( i.e., Stage 
5 disease); even with costly treatments, however, patients with ESRD experience substantial 
morbidity and mortality .[ADDRESS_828902] patients require renal replacement therapy (dialysis or 
kidney transplantation). Preventing or delaying adverse outcomes of CKD via early interv ention is 
the primary strategy in CKD management .[ADDRESS_828903].  
1.1.2.  Progressive Staging of CKD 
The major  causes  of CKD  are diabetes  and hypertension.  Nearly  half of all CKD  cases  arise f rom 
diabetes with or without hypertension .2,5   The incidence of CKD continues to increase, primarily 
due to  the increased  incidence of  Type 2  Diabetes  Mellitus  (T2DM ).[ADDRESS_828904] often quantified by [CONTACT_622527] (GFR), which is defined as “the volume of plasma from which a given s ubstance is 
completely  cleared  by [CONTACT_622528]” .7  Creatinine clearance is  the principal  
endogenous marker that is used to measure GFR. In February 2002, with the aim of providing a 
uniform definition of CKD, the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative of the US Kidney 
Foundation defined CKD and the various stages of CK D8 (Table  4). For example, the threshold for 
CKD is 60 mL/min/1.73m2, which is less than one-half of the GFR for a normal, young adult male 
(120-130 mL/min/1.73m2).9   Additionally, there is a heightened risk for CKD complications when 
the GFR  is 60 mL/m in/1.73m2 and lower. 
Table  4 defines  CKD  stages  according  to GFR  measurements,  and the relative prevalence  and 
clinical  action  taken  at each stage .13   The initial stage of diabetic nephropathy (Stage 1) occurs over 
a period of several years and is characterized by [CONTACT_622529] (30- 300 mg/24 hr .) followed by 
[CONTACT_622530] (> 300 mg/24 hr .). As the ability of the kidney to filter blood waste products 
declines,  serum  creatinine rises.  With  increasing  kidney  damage (Stages  2-4), rising blood pressure 
further  exacerbates  kidney  disease.  When  the kidneys  cease to  function entirely (Stage 5 [ESRD]), 
renal replacement therapy (dialysis or transplantation) is required.

All-cause mortality rates were shown to increase as GFR declined ; mortality rates were highest at 
Stages 4 -5 of CKD .10,11,12  Populations defined as having an eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73m2 consistently 
exhibited a higher mortality rate than comparator groups where there was no evidence  of CKD. 
1.1.3.  Standard -of-Care in CKD  
Treatment of patients with CKD is focused on slowing progression and preparing for ki dney failure 
/replacement. For many pati ents, CKD occurs as part of a complex comorbidity cluster, especially 
with cardiovascular disease and T2DM. 
Increased risk of cardiovascular disease can be a complication of CKD or an i ndependent 
comorbidity associated with T2DM .14 Collectively, the aim is to lower cardiovascular risk and 
prevent or slow the progression of kidney failure via administration of: 1) angiotensin conve rting 
enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and/or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) to decrease  proteinuria and 
control hypertension; 2) insulin and anti-diabetic agents for glycemic control (e.g., reduced serum 
hemoglobin A1c); and, 3) statin therapy to counter dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035]. 
When a patient reaches ESRD, renal replacement therap y (i.e. , dialysis or transplantation) is 
indicated. The vast majority of Stage 5 patients receive hemodialysis .15   Dialysis replaces about 5 -
15% of kidney function, depending on the intensity and frequency of use; dialysis also helps to 
restore fluid and electrolyte balance when kidneys fail. However, the life- expectancy of an ESRD 
patient initiating hemodialysis is only [ADDRESS_828905] 
effective form of therapy at this time; there is a c hronic shortage of organs. If a patient is able to 
secure a kidney for transplantation, long-term immunosuppressive therapy is require d to prevent 
rejection. Use of these regimens results in a higher incidence of infection and, over t he long term, 
some types of cancer .17 Taken together, there is a critical medical need for impro ved therapi[INVESTIGATOR_622500] y the need for 
renal transplantation. 
1.2. Scientific Rationale  
ProKidney is developi[INVESTIGATOR_622501] (REACT ) based on extensive scientific 
evaluation of its biologically active component known as SRC ( i.e., homologous, autologous 
selected renal cells). This cell population is naturally involved in renal repair  and 
regeneration .18,19,20,21,[ADDRESS_828906]  is intended to

CKD by [CONTACT_622531] l structur e and function .18,19,33,[ADDRESS_828908] ed

c.Two doses of REACT  were administered, one at [ADDRESS_828909]  was established in 
multiple animal models of CKD. For example, the 5/6th nephrectomy (Nx) rodent mass r eduction 
model of CKD allowed for an optimized selection of a therapeutically relevant SR C cell population. 
A 70% Nx canine model of CKD confirmed SRC activity in a large mammal, while the ZS F-1 rat 
Confidential  Page 25 12 January 2021 ProKidney Renal Autologous Cell Therapy (REACT) REGEN -[ADDRESS_828910] engraftment or tissue replacement, and also i nduced secretory 
factors via a putative paracrine mechanism .18,21,22,24, 26 
This intervention strategy significantly improved survival, stabilized disease pr ogression, and 
extended the longevity in both the 5/6th Nx model and the ZSF-1 rodent models of CKD. 
Morphological normalization of multiple nephron structures was accompanied by [CONTACT_622532] l 
improvements, including glomerular filtration, tubular protein handling, electrolyte ba lance, and the 
ability to concentrate urine. Lowered blood pressure and reduced levels of circulating r enin were 
also observed in the ZSF-1 rat model. The observed functional improvements following SRC  
treatment were accompanied by [CONTACT_622533] , tubular degeneration 
and interstitial inflammation and fibrosis. No toxicologicall y significant in -life, clinical pathology, 
or histological changes were noted in the target organ or other tissues. Based on results fr om 
multiple pre -clinical studies conducted in different CKD animal models, SRC ( i.e., active 
component of REACT ) were effective in significantly delaying progression of CKD when 
implanted in the diseased organ prior to irreversible nephropathy. These results pr ovide a rationale 
for investigating the effects of this cell -based intervention in patients prior to ESRD. 
1.3.2.  Safety Pharmacology 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Extra -Renal Activity  
REACT  (i.e., SRC formulat ed in a gelatin -based hydrogel) was administered in various rat and 
canine models to assess immediate cardiovascular and respi [INVESTIGATOR_622502]. The acute 
effects of lower and higher SRC concentrations formulated in varying percentages  of gelatin (0.75-
1.0%) were evaluated in the rodent 5/6th Nx model. Potential changes in blood pressure we re 
assessed immediately before, during, and shortly after REACT  delivery in the normal canine model. 
No studies on the effects of REACT  on the central nervous system were performed since: 1) 
animals exhibited normal behavior before, during, and after REACT  injection; 2) no effects on the 
central nervous system were expected from an investigational product containing i ntact renal cells; 
and, 3) REACT  was delivere d into the kidney. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Hemodynamic Effects  
Rats in the 5/6th Nx study (Study #4) received REACT  or vehicle control, and potential 
hemodynamic effects were monitored over [ADDRESS_828911]  delivery. A 
total of 9 animals died; the causes of death were classif ied as apnea (n=3), renal hemorrhage (n=2), 
and deaths associated with CKD (n=4). Six of the 16 animals that experienced apnea  were not pre-
treated with atropi[INVESTIGATOR_050]; of these animals that experienced apnea, two died under the inf luence of 
anesthesia prior to the use of atropi[INVESTIGATOR_050]. Ten of the [ADDRESS_828912]  injection. 
On the other hand, apnea, renal hemorrhage, and deaths that occurred in the 5/6th Nx rat study we re 
not observed in the ZSF-1 rat study, or in the canine pharmacology study, or in two (intact) canine 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_622503]-term effects of volume administration on bl ood pressure. Taken 
together, this model-specific hemodynamic response can be potentially attributed to:   1) altered 
hemodynamics of the severely mass -reduced rodent remnant kidney  38 2) transient changes in 
kidney interstitial pressure administration triggering a c entral autonomic  response ;39 40 and, 3) under

of CKD.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Dose Volume  
Using a range of REACT  doses, volumes, and concentrations, (Study #5), the normal canine was 
selected to evaluate blood pressure immediately before, during, and after R EACT  delivery into the 
kidney. In this study, each pole of each kidney received 2.[ADDRESS_828914] ; therefore, a total of  
10 mL/120 g, or 0.083 mL/g, was delivered at a dosage of 12.5 x 106 cells /gram of kidney mass. 
REACT  treatment was well tolerated; there were no adverse syst emic effects (physical or 
serological), nor were there any significant toxicological or histomorphological change s indicative 
of kidney injury or other tissue injury as a result of REACT  delivery. In  contrast to the severe mass 
reduction rodent model of CKD, no apnea, renal hemorrhage, or deaths were noted. 
1.3.3.  Kinetics, Migration, and Persistence  
As with other  cell-base d therapie s targeting sof t organs, dat a on biodistribution of the 
investigationa l produc t has been limited. To tha t end, thre e additiona l studie s provi de evidence 
concerning t he potentia l migration and persistenc e of REACT  within t he kidney a t selected 
sampling  times  post-delivery .24,25,26   The results  of these  studies  are summarized  in this section; 
detailed information is provided in the Investigator’s Brochure . 
[IP_ADDRESS].  ZSF-1 Rat 
SRC s were labeled with t he Rhodamine- B superparamagneti c iron oxid e (SPIO ) particle.  This 
contras t agent is specifically formulated f or cell labeling and i s readily internalized by [CONTACT_105]- 
phagocyti c cells. SPIO- labeled  cells were  administered  to the ZSF-1 rat kidney. Twenty-f our hours 
after delivery,  SPIO -labeled  cells were detec ted by [CONTACT_66243] I and whol e organ optica l imaging. In 
addition, ZSF- 1 rats received  SRCs  labeled  with CelSense -19F , which wer e quantified by [CONTACT_622534]  3 hr., 24 hr., a nd 7 da ys after implantation .24,25 
Both acute ZSF -1 detection and long-ter m donor cell detection using t he 5/6th Nx mode l of CKD 
showed significa nt retention of SPIO- labeled  cells.  Clinically  relevant  MRI detection  at 24  hr. 
following cel l delivery revealed a region a t the anteri or pole of the kidne y wher e SPIO- labeled  cells 
had been injected. Sectioning of t he whol e kidne y and staining with Prussian bl ue demonstrate d a 
bolus of iron labeled SPIO  cells migrating  and distributing  from  the cortical injection  site, which  
confirmed thei r presenc e in tubula r and peritubula r space s of the renal cortex and medulla. 
Likewise, whol e organ fluoresce nt imaging highlighted cel l detection a t and around t he site of 
injection located a t the uppe r cortex of t he anterio r pole of the ZSF-1 ra t kidney. Detection of 19F-
labeled SR C at 3 and 24 hr . after deliver y confirmed nearly 100 % retenti on in the kidney. Afte r 7 
days, detection of 19F-labeled SR C was diminished by [CONTACT_622535] r of magnitude, consiste nt with 
conti nuous urinary excretion. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Porcine Non -GLP Analysi s of Non- Renal  Tissue  
In a pre-clinical, non-GLP study, SPIO-labeled SRC were delivered to the kidneys of l iving swine 
(n=11). Cellular distribution was monitored over the course of the 30-day study period using MRI . 
Labelled SRC wer e distributed in two major compartments:  urinary bladder and renal parenchyma. 
Confidential  Page 27 12 January 2021 ProKidney Renal Autologous Cell Therapy (REACT) REGEN -003 v1.7 
The major route of excretion was urine. Notably, there was no evidence of ectopic SR C migration 
or site -specific engraftment at non -target organ sites .41 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Canine Non -GLP Analysis of Non- Renal Tissue  
In a pre-clinical, non-GLP study, SPIO-labeled SRC were delivered to the kidneys of l iving canine 
hosts. Cellular distribution was monitored at [ADDRESS_828915]- injection via MRI. Consistent with 
observa tions from the living porcine model demonstrating that inj ected SPIO -labeled SRC was 
retained in renal parenchyma or excreted in urine, SPIO -labeled SRC likewise were retained within 
the renal parenchyma at the injection site after 30 minutes . 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Conclusions  
•SRC are distributed at the site of injection (renal par enchyma) and excreted via the
urine, based on SRC labeling studies with SPIO and CelSense-19F.
•SRC delivered into rat, swine, and canine kidneys were not detected in non- target organs
(other than urinary tract during excretion), based on extensive histological evaluation.
•Based on reports concerning allogenic mesenchymal stem cell s as well as published data
concerning the safety of autologous mesenchymal stem cells in clinical trials, a utologous
REACT -related materials should also not give rise to ectopic tissue growth, org an
dysfunction, or tumor development .42,43,44,45,[ADDRESS_828916] , thre e GLP safet y studie s were conducted, i .e., one  study was

rats, a model of uncontrolled metabolic syndrome including T2DM, hypertension, and severe 
obesity. The rats received:  1) high dose REACT ; 2) low dose REACT ; 3) sham; or, 4) biomaterial 
only. Each animal received [ADDRESS_828918]- treatment.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Renal -Related Findings  
No tre atment -related kidney findings were noted following evaluation of 8 areas of each kidney (3 
stains per area), including assessment and scoring of 150 glomeruli per kidney. Apart f rom changes 
related to implantation and/or injection site linear scar s, all k idneys were considered normal within 
the context of the disease model. No test article -related kidney finding was observed at 3- or 6-
month post- treatment. All macroscopic and microscopic kidney change s were considered related to 
the natural progression of renal disease in the ZSF -1 obese rat, or to the injection procedure. 
Kidney changes in all groups were more severe in males, and consistent with differe nces in the 
disease stage between genders. Overall, there was an apparent trend of lower  renal histolog ical 
severity scores (i.e. , lower glomerular injury score, tubule- interstitial injury score, and global 
nephron score) that was consistently noted in the low-concentration REACT  treatment group when 
compared to the Sham control group [ADDRESS_828919]-procedur e.

(NOAEL) was the high dose, 6.25 x 106 cells /g KWest. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Non-Renal Findings  
No REACT  safety -related findings were observed in non- target tissues. No ureteral or b ladder 
(primary routes of REACT  excretion) REACT -related changes were observed. There were no 
REACT - related effects, and no observable REACT  cellular materials in any of the draining (lymph 
nodes) or filtering (liver, lung, spleen) tissues examined. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Clini cal Pathology 
The results of clinical laboratory tests (including hematology, clinical chemis try, and special 
urinalysis panels) were evaluated for differences between baseline a nd end of study (3- or 6-months 
post- treatment), and between treated and contr ol groups. No REACT -related clinically significant 
laboratory abnormalities were identified.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Conclusions:  
• All animals survived to the end of study (3- or 6-months post- treatment).  
• There were no significant safety -related clinical pathology findings or safety -related 
findings of toxicological significance attributable to treatment.  
• No REACT -related clinically significant laboratory abnormalities were identified.  
• The observed NOAEL was 6.25 x 106 cells /g KWest. 
1.4.2.  Initial Single Dose Canine Study  
The initial canine toxicology study assessed the safety of a single administration of tw o different 
doses of REACT  compared to sham treatment or treatment with the biomaterial.  The test article was 
delivered into one pole of each kidney. A total of 32 mongrel dogs were entered into the study; 16 
were assessed at one month and 16 were assessed at 3 months.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  General Results  
All 32 animals survived to their designated termination time point at one or 3 months aft er 
treatment. The animals appeared to be in good health throughout the study. There were no 
significant clinical pathology findings. There were no signs of renal insufficiency (a zotemia), and 
there were no indications of decreased GFR. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Renal -Related Results  
No REACT  delivery -related macroscopic or micros copic findings were observed at the one- or 3-
month endpoint. No treatment-related kidney findings were noted following enhanced evalu ation of 
8 areas of each kidney (3 stains per area), including evaluation and scoring of 150 glomerul i per 
kidney. Apart f rom changes related to injection site scars all kidneys were n ormal. All macroscopic 
and microscopic kidney changes were considered background findings or related to the i njection 
procedures. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Non-Renal Findings  
No test article -related findings were identified in other (non-kidney) tissues. All macroscop ic and 
microscopic changes were considered background changes and within normal limit s. 
Confidential  Page 29 12 January 2021 ProKidney Renal Autologous Cell Therapy (REACT) REGEN -003 v1.7 
 
 
   [IP_ADDRESS].  Procedure -Related Findings  
The most common abnormalities included swelling at the incisio n sites (seroma formation) and 
weight loss at study termination. With regard to incision site swelling, ten of sixtee n (10/16) 
animals had sterile seroma formation post-implantation, and nine of sixteen (9/ 16) post treatment. 
The animals had varying degrees of swelling at their retroper itoneal incisions and were treated as 
deemed necessary by a veterinarian.  
Numerous animals had mild inappetence following REACT  administration (29 of 32) and treatment 
procedures (18 of 32). Most animals (28 of 32) experienced weight loss from baseline  (prior to 
implantation) to termination. Of note, a greater amount of weight loss occurred bet ween baseline (2 
weeks prior to treatment) and treatment (Day 0; renal injecti ons) than between treatment and 
termination. Weight loss also occurred across all treatm ent groups and was judged to be related to 
the stressful nature of the study. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Conclusions  
• All animals survived to their designated termination time point and were in good general  
health throughout the study based on clinical pathology, urinalysis, and vete rinary 
assessment.  
• Neither the low or high dose of REACT  produced macroscopic or microscopic adverse 
effects at one- or 3-months post- treatment, similar to observations following sham 
treatment or treatment with the biomaterial.  
• Pathological evaluation showed no REACT  safety -related (macroscopic or microscopic) 
findings in the target (kidney) or non-target organs examined. 
• Based on anatomic pathology, the observed NOAEL was the higher concentration 
tested, i.e. , 11.7 x 106 cells/g KWest. 
1.4.3.  Repeat Dose Canine Study  
The second canine toxicology study assessed the safety of administering two repeat dos es of 
REACT . Each dose was delivered into both kidneys at baseline (time zero) and 3 months. All 
animals were subjected to two renal biopsies per kidney 4 to 6 weeks prior t o the baseline injection 
procedure. Control animals were injected with PBS. Animals were monitored for 6 m onths 
following the baseline injection. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Study Results  
All 8 animals were in good clinical health throughout the study and survived to their d esignated 
termination time point at 6 months. There was mild or insignificant weight loss in 5 of 8 a nimals, 
with 2 animals losing >3% body weight for the duration of the study. Greater weight loss occu rred 
between the renal implantation and initial treatment than betw een the initial treatment and 
termination. The clinical pathology and urinalysis data revealed no abnormal trends . There were no 
signs of renal insufficiency, and no indications of decreased GFR. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Kidney -Related Findings  
No REACT  implantation s afety -related macroscopic or microscopic findings were observed at the 
6-month time point.  No treatment-related kidney findings were noted following enhance d 
evaluation of 8 areas of each kidney (3 stains per area), including evaluation and scori ng of 150 
glomeruli per kidney. All kidneys appeared normal, apart from changes related to inj ection site

   scars (fibrosis/chronic inflammation in the capsule; lin ear fibrosis/chronic inflammation and 
inflammatory cells in the cortex/medulla).  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Non-Kidney Related Fin dings  
No test article safety -related findings were identified in non- target tissues. All macroscopic and 
microscopic changes were considered background changes and thus, considered within norma l 
limits.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Conclusions  
• All animals survived to their designated termination time point, and appeared in good 
health based on clinical pathology, urinalysis, and veterinary assessment data. 
• Pathological assessment showed no REACT  safety -related (macroscopic or microscopic) 
findings in either the target organ (kidney) or non-target organs examined. 
• At the [ADDRESS_828921]  were 
observed in comparison to the control animals injected with PBS. 
1.5. Non-clinical Conclusions  
Evidence from multiple animal studies over a wide range of doses (3 to 15 million SRC/g of kidney 
tissue implanted), and extended periods of time post- REACT  treatment (up to one year), including 
three GLP studies, indicates that the potential risk of co mplications from REACT  delivery into the 
kidney is similar to the potential risk of complications associated with standar d renal biopsy 
practice .47,48,49 
Apart from changes related to injection procedures and cardiovascular findi ngs specific to 5/6th 
nephrectomy rodent mass reduction model of CKD, no unanticipated in- life, hematological, 
urological, serological, or histological changes were found in the target organ or non- target tissues 
following delivery of REACT . 
1.6. Phase 1 Clinical Trial: Interim Results  
1.6.1.  Background 
In April 2013, a first- in-human clinical trial was initiated at the Karolinska Univ ersity Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_622504], Sweden: A Phase 1, Open-Label Safety and Delivery Optimization St udy 
of Renal Autologous Cell Therapy ( REACT ) in Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease 
(RMTX -CL001). This is a Phase 1, open-label, safety and delivery optimization study of REACT  
implanted into subjects with CKD. REACT  will be manufactured from SRC obtained from a 
subject’s renal biopsy, formulated with gelatin biomaterial, and injected back into the subject’s left 
kidney. The primary objective is to assess the safety and optimal delivery of REACT  implanted at 
one site in a recipi[INVESTIGATOR_622505]- and/or product- related adverse events 
(AEs) through [ADDRESS_828922]’s ba seline rate

insufficiency over time. Six subjects, recruited from the Karolinska Universit y Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], were 
enrolled into the study. In addition, one subject was enrolled in the study at the University of Nor th 
Carolina.  
Confidential  Page 31 12 January 2021 ProKidney Renal Autologous Cell Therapy (REACT) REGEN -003 v1.7 
1.6.2.  Adverse Events  
Among a cohort of 7 male subjects, 53 to 70 years of age, with pre-dialysis diabetic nephropat hy 
(Stage 3b/4 of CKD), all subjects recovered from the laparoscopic REACT  delivery procedure 
without immediate  perioperative  complications.  Notably,  no subject experienced hematuria, which 
was prospectively considered to be the most likely untoward event. One subject develope d an 
intestinal volvulus on Day [ADDRESS_828923]. All serious adverse events (SAEs) 
associated  with the clinical trial are  presented  in Table  6. 
Eight of the nine SAEs were considered possibly related to the implant surgery. There w ere no AEs 
or SAEs considered related to the biopsy procedure. To date, no delayed or late- onset  adverse 
reactions  related  to REACT  or other study procedures have been identified (e.g., negative immune 
mediated reactions). Based on the current data, the highest risk associated with R EACT  treatment 
appears to be from the implant surgery. Consequently, steps are being taken to decreas e the duration 
of the surgical procedure and improve surgical outcomes.

species studied (refer to the Investigator’s Brochure ). In the clinical trials TNG -CL010 and TN G-
CL011, cortica l thicknes s was evaluated using imaging technologies ; no biopsie s were taken to 
confir m the basis for the increased thickness. Cortica l thicknes s was measured in both t he right and 
left kidney  to determine  if the impla nted lef t kidney exhibited any chang e in cortica l thicknes s that 
could be attributed to R EACT  implantation. T he right kidney served a s a non-implanted control. 
On average, cortica l thicknes s increased in t he left kidney fr om [ADDRESS_828927]  treatment.  This change  in cortical thickness  was not sufficient  to 
cause an increas e in the total volum e of the left kidney (dat a not presented). No cha nge in cortical 
thicknes s was observed in t he right kidney cortex. 
1.6.5.  Hemoglobin 
CKD can be associated wit h anemia due to an alteration in renal erythropoietin production as well 
as metabolic abnormalities resulting from chronic uremia .[ADDRESS_828928]  can be broadly divided into 3 
categories:  kidney biopsy, REACT  product, and delivery into the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_622495]. An assessment 
of potential risks associated with each of these steps is  presented in this Section. 
At this time, there are no specific warnings or precautions associated with the  use of REACT . 
However, warnings and precautions for the renal biopsy and the percutaneous inject ion procedure 
must be considered with use of this product. The risks of renal biopsy have been well ch aracterized 
in the 100 years that this procedure has been used and developed. Percutaneous needle 
instrumentation of the kidney has a shorter history. 
The risks of renal biopsy and percutaneous needle kidney injection include: 
1.Pain in flank / injection/biopsy site
2. Bleeding at injection/biopsy site which may occur around the kidney or anywhere along the
needle track and which may be sufficient to entail clinically significant anemi a, acute kidney
injury (AKI), hematoma, and in the case of subcapsular bleeding, a “Page kidney” a nd acute
hypertension
3. Surgical damage to the kidney from needle injury, as well as injuries of other struc tures that
include connective tissues, bone, and intra-abdominal viscera

of an imm une respons e (e.g., graf t rejecti on) caused by R EACT  injection into t he kidney seems 
unlikely. 
Since the kidney i s a highly perfused organ, i t is doubtf ul that the implanted SR C will remain 
localized  at the  injection  site. The three  locations  considered  to be the most likely  destinations  of 
migrated  SRC  are: 1) the sub-capsular  space;  2) the systemic circulation;  and, 3) the urinary  tract.  
Leakag e of SRC into t he sub-capsular  space is  not expected  to pose a risk  to the subject.

Notes:  
a.The dose of REACT  will be 3 x 106 cells/g estimated kidney weight.
b.Kidney weight will be estimated from an MRI study p erformed before renal biopsy.
c.8 mL will be the maximum dosing volume (mL).
The dose of REACT  will be based on kidney volume calculated via MRI. In contrast to other 
methods, measurements of renal volume using MRI are more accurate, and acquire tru e 
tomographic data along any orientation without the risk of ionizing radiation or nephrotoxic 
contra st agents. Renal volume measurements (mL) estimated from M RI are approximately 92 to 
97% of dry weight measurements in grams for isolated organs trimmed of perirenal f at. As a 
conservative approach, the REACT  dose will be calculated using a conversion of one g equals one 
mL. The volume of REACT  to be administered will be determined by [CONTACT_094]- procedure MRI 
volumetric 3D evaluation or ellipsoid formula (Length x width AP plane x width Transverse  plan x 
.62). This ensures that subjects will not receive REACT  doses higher than those previously tested in 
animal studies.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Rationale for Two REACT  Injections  
It is anticipated that all subjects will receive two p lanned REACT  injections to allow dose-finding 
and evaluate the duration of effects. The scientific ratio nale, based on non- clinical studies, is that 
the biologically active component of REACT  (homologous, autologous, SRC) delays progression of 
experimental models of CKD by [CONTACT_622537] .18,19,33,[ADDRESS_828951] “new” cells delivere d via REACT

the event that the subjec t cannot schedul e his/he r second R EACT  injection  [ADDRESS_828953]  injecti on should not be 
administered.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Safety of Two R EACT  Injections  
To asses s the safety of administering two dose s of REACT  into t he biopsie d kidney, a canin e GLP  
toxicology study wa s conducted (Refe r to Section  1.4.2 ). Simila r to the clinica l study design, study 
animal s (n=8) underwe nt renal biopsie s at 4 to 6 wee ks prior to baseline . Each dos e was delivered  
into both kidne ys at baseli ne and 3 months ; animal s were observe d for [ADDRESS_828954]  safety- relate d (macroscopi c or microscopic ) findi ngs in eithe r the targe t organ (kidney) 
or non-target  organs  examined.  No treatment -related kidney findi ngs were noted following 
enhanced evaluation of 8 area s of each kidney (3 stai ns per area), including assessme nt and scoring 
of 150 glomerul i per kidney. Al l kidne ys appeared normal, apar t from change s related to injection 
site scars. There were no signs of renal insufficiency, and no indications of decreased GFR.

The product delivery system consists of 3 components: 
1. [ADDRESS_828955], Luer- Lok® syringe
2. Package for containment of the syringe
3.REACT  shippi[INVESTIGATOR_622507] a package designed to 
maintain integrity of the product as well as sterility of the product and syringe. A re presentative 
image of the product delivery system is shown in  Figure 3.  
Confidential  Page 44 12 January 2021 ProKidney Renal Autologous Cell Therapy (REACT) REGEN -[ADDRESS_828956] with 
contaminated needles, blood, and blood products; appropriate blood and secretion precautions  will 
be employed by [CONTACT_622538][INVESTIGATOR_122505], as 
currently recommended by [CONTACT_622539].  
All material containin g investigational drug product will be treated and disposed of as hazardous 
waste in accordance with governing regulations and clinical site  procedures.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Disposition of Stored Specimens  
Specimens will be stored in the vapor phase of a liquid nitrogen freeze r at ProKidney. Only 
Investigators or suitably qualified  individuals who have received appropriate study- specific training 
and whose names are listed on the Delegation of Responsibility Log will have access  to these 
specimens.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Unused Specimens  
Renal cells that may have been frozen but not used to manufacture REACT  will be remain in the 
vapor phase of a liquid nitrogen freezer at ProKidney until the EOS Visit. At that time, if these renal 
cells are no longer needed, they will be de-identified of all personal information a nd stored in the 
vapor phase of a liquid nitrogen freezer for a maximum of [ADDRESS_828957] be provided the option not to store or use 
their unused renal cells  and research samples (as described in  Table  2), and must provide written 
consent for the storage and future use of autologous cells not used for REACT  injection  if they 
consent to the long-term storage of unused specimens. Additionally, subjects may decide a t any 
point during the study not to have their unused renal cells stored. In this case, the Investigator will 
destr oy all known remaining samples attributed to that subject and report what was done to both t he 
subject and to the IRB. Likewise, subjects must have the option of having their cells de stroyed upon 
completion of the study.

Investigator, be jeopardized, then the second REACT  injection should not be administered. 
4.5. Study Duration  
Subjects will begin their series of REACT  injection(s) as soon as the autologous REACT  
preparation is made available. Assuming a one- month interval prior to the first REACT  injection, 
and assuming a 6-month interval before the second injection, plus a 24-month follow-up period 
after the final injection, the study duration would be:

subject is unwilling to continue using a highly effective method of birth control throughout 
the duration of the study.  
Note: A highly effective method of birth control is defined as one that results in a l ow 
failure rate (i.e. , less than one percent per year) when used consistently and correctly, such 
as implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, some intrauterine  devices IUDs, 
sexual abstinence, or a vasectomized partner.  
24. The subject has a history of active alcohol and/or drug abuse that, in the judgment of the

5.3. Prohibited and Concomitant Medications  
• The consumption of NSAIDs (including aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]) as well as clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745], prasugr el, or other 
platelet inhibitors is prohibited during the study beginning [ADDRESS_828971]  injection(s).  
• Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], up to a dose of 100 mg/day, may be continued if doing so is the standard of care at 
the investigational site, for subjects with  diabetes who are greater than [ADDRESS_828972] additional risk factors for cardiovascular disease or stroke, and for whom the  perceived 
benefits of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_622508] h treatment.  
• Intake of fish oil and platelet aggregation inhibitors, such as dipryridamole ( i.e., Persantine), 
is prohibited during the study beginning [ADDRESS_828973]  injection(s).  
Confidential  Page 51 12 January 2021 ProKidney Renal Autologous Cell Therapy (REACT) REGEN -003 v1.7 
 
 
   • Subjects who are undergoing treatment with an ACEI or an ARB must have initiated t herapy 
at least [ADDRESS_828974]  injection. Stable treatment is defined as dose adjustment no 
less than one-half of the current dosage and no more than 2 times the current dosage. In 
addition, except where medically necessary, no changes should be made to the ACEI or 
ARB dosing regimen from Screening through the 24-month EOS Visit. Dose interruptions 
up to 7 d ays due to medical necessity are allowed.  
• Medications that interfere with measurements of SCr should be avoided during the st udy, 
such as trimethoprim, dronedarone, and cimetidine. If such medications are requir ed based 
on medical necessity, then the circu mstance should be discussed with the Medical Monitor 
and documented within the CRF. 
• Use of investigational drugs is prohibited during the course of the study, unless preap proved 
by [CONTACT_1689]. Investigational drugs are defined as drugs that have not bee n 
approved for use by [CONTACT_1622]. 
5.4. Subject Withdrawal Criteria  
Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason without penalty or prejudice, 
and without jeopardizing access to future medical care. If the Investigat or determines that 
continuing in the study is no longer in the best interest of the subject, then the Investigator  should 
withdraw the subject from the study. If a subject voluntarily withdraws from t he study, the reason(s) 
should be documented. Subjects who withdraw from the study or are withdrawn by [CONTACT_622541]. 
If a subject withdraws from the study before having the renal biopsy, the subject  will be considered 
a screen failure. If a subject withdraws from the study following the renal b iopsy but before the first 
REACT  injection, the subject will not be a screen failure, but will not be consi dered enrolled and 
may be replaced. If a subject withdraws from the study after REACT  injection but before the end of 
the follow-up period, the subject cannot be replaced. 
Patients that do not meet I/E criteria on the RMCL -[ADDRESS_828975] completed a biopsy in RMCL-002 will not undergo another 
biopsy if they enroll in REGEN -003.

   6. STUDY VISITS  
The schedules of clinical assessments and procedures to be performed during t he study ar e 
displayed in the time and events tables, i.e., Table  1. Similarly, the schedules of sample collection 
and clinical laboratory evaluations planned for the study are displayed in the laboratory t ime and 
events tables, i.e., Table 2. Before conducting any study specific assessments or procedures 
(including screening), the subject must provide written informed consent in accordanc e with ICH 
GCP guidelines and [ADDRESS_828976] eligibility ( i.e., no 
evidence of renal tumors, polycystic kidney disease, renal cysts or other anatomic  abnormalities that 
would interfere with the REACT  injection procedure) along with obtaining a baseline echogenicity 
reading. Additionally, a MRI study without contrast will be performed from the time  of Screening 
Visit through Day -[ADDRESS_828977]’s eGFR must be between 14 and 20 mL/min/1.73m2 
inclusive at the Screening Visit. To define the eGFR for entry criteria, the site should use the  eGFR 
assessed during screening and calculate using the CKD- EPI [INVESTIGATOR_10908] .[ADDRESS_828978]  injection approximately one 
month later. Due to shippi[INVESTIGATOR_622509], the preferred day for collecting th e renal 
biopsy cores is on a Wednesday or Thursday. Biopsies should not be collected on a Friday. 
Subjects will report to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_622510] d ays before the biopsy for 
pre-biopsy assessments. As much as possible, pre-biopsy laboratory samples may be collected and 
Confidential  Page 53 12 January 2021 ProKidney Renal Autologous Cell Therapy (REACT) REGEN -[ADDRESS_828979]  injections to allow dose-finding 
and to evaluate the duration of effects. As indicated on the time and events tables ( i.e., Table  1), the 
series of [ADDRESS_828980] cannot schedule 
his/her second REACT  injection [ADDRESS_828981] injection or  cannot keep his/her 
scheduled 6-month visit, ProKidney and the Medical Monitor must be notified immediately. The 
expectation is that the subject and the clinical center wil l accommodate the  Sponsor’s preference 
that the series of [ADDRESS_828982]. The Investigator and 
ProKidney will discuss the reason(s) that the subject did not qualify and determine the  best course 
of action. For example, if the subject was excluded for a te mporary condition (e.g. , active infection) 
then it may be possible to manufacture REACT  at a later date, assuming future eligibility can be 
established. If the results of pre- treatment assessments indicate that it is highly unlikely  for that 
subject to becom e eligible for REACT  injection(s), then the subject should be discontinued from the 
study. If REACT  injection is delayed ( e.g., due to an intercurrent illness), the renal scintigraphy 
study, if conducted, does not need to be repeated prior to injection. 
Confidential  Page 54 12 January 2021 ProKidney Renal Autologous Cell Therapy (REACT) REGEN -[ADDRESS_828983] 
possible, subclinical adverse effects (e.g., swelling, fluid accumulation). If pr oduct- or procedure - 
related AE’s occurred following REACT  injection, the subject should not be discharged until the 
AE’s have resolved, stabilized, or returned to baseline. If consistent with the si te’s standard 
practice, the subject may be discharged the same day as the REACT  injection after no less than  [ADDRESS_828984] will return to the clinic for follow -up visits on Days 1 (if discharged day of REACT  
injection), 7, 14, and 28 (± 3 days) and Months 2, 3, 4 and 5 (± 7 days) after the first REACT  
injection , and on Days 1 (if discharged day of REACT  injection), 7, 14, and 28 (± 3 days) and 
Months 2 and 3 (± 7 days) after the second  REACT  injection (Table  1 and Table  2).The subject will 
also report to the clinical center [ADDRESS_828985]  injection, subjects will complete long -term, follow -up assessments of 
safety and efficacy through Months 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24 (± 7 days) post- treatment.  
6.6. End-of-Study Visit  
This section describes situations in which a subject will undergo the EOS visit; for  example, due to 
premature discontinuation from the study or completion of all protocol-specified foll ow-up visits. 
• If a subject discontinues from the study after undergoing the renal biopsy but before  
REA CT injection, then that subject should complete all EOS assessments except for t he 
MRI and/or renal scintigraphy studies. These imaging studies should only be completed 
if, in the judgment of the Investigator, one and/or the other would provide critical sa fety 
information needed for patient care. If the subject is experiencing an inves tigational 
product- or study procedure-related SAE, then the subject will not be discontinued until  
the SAE has resolved, stabilized, or returned to baseline. 
• If a subject dis continues from the study after undergoing one or two REACT  injections 
but before completing all of the protocol- specified follow -up visits, then he/she should 
have the EOS Visit at the time of discontinuation. For these subjects, the Investi gator 
will dete rmine whether or not it is clinically prudent to perform one or both of the 
imaging studies ( i.e., MRI and renal scintigraphy). If the subject is experiencing an 
investigational product- or study procedure-related SAE, then the subject will not  be 
discontinued until the SAE has resolved, stabilized, or returned to baseline. 
• If a subject completes all of the protocol- specified follow -up visits, he/she will undergo 
all EOS assessments [ADDRESS_828986] will not be discontinued until the SAE has resolved, stabilized, or returne d to 
baseline.

All CKD -related medical history and all other significant medical history  will be recorded in the 
CRF beginning at the Screening Visit. Throughout the study, medical conditions that are stil l 
ongoing will be regularly updated in the CRF. 
7.2. Clinical Evaluations  
7.2.1.  Vital Signs  
Vital signs to be measured include systolic/diastolic blood pressure, hear t rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], and 
temperature. Blood pressure will be measured after the subject has res ted in a sitting position for a 
minimum of 5 minutes. At the Pre -Biopsy Visit (Day -3 to Day-1) and Pre- Injection Visit (Day -14 
to Day - 10 Visit), three BP measurements will be taken and the average of the 3 measurements (for 
systolic and diastolic pressure) used to satisfy entry criteria and entered i nto the CRF. 
7.2.2.  Physical Examination 
The Investigator or designee will perform the PE. The compreh ensive examination will assess all 
pertinent body systems while the interim examination will include specific assessments of those  
body systems deemed appropriate for that subject by [CONTACT_737]. As a general rule for the 
interim examination, the Investigator will review the subject’s AEs prior to, or in conjunction with, 
the examination and include assessment of related body sy stems as  appropriate. Only clinically 
significant abnormalities will be recorded in the CRF.  
The subject’s weight will be measured at every visit that i ncludes a complete or interim physical 
examination. The subject’s height will be taken at the Screening Visit. Body Mass  Index (BMI) will 
be calculated as kg/m2. 
7.2.3.  ECG  
A [ADDRESS_828989] has been resting on their b ack for 5 minutes. 
7.2.4.  Concomitant Medications 
Concomitant medications will be recorded in the CRF as follows:  
• Screening V isit until first REACT  injection:  Record any CKD- specific medications 
as well as medications that may affect renal hemodynamics a nd/or serum creatinine 
measurements. In addition, record any medications used to treat an AE that is 
documented in the CRF. Surgical medications used during the biopsy procedure do not 
need to be captured in the CRF unless their use falls outside of expected dosages  and/or 
frequencies of administration. 
• First REACT  injection until 6 to 7 months of follow -up: Record any medication s 
taken until [ADDRESS_828990]  injection 
procedure do not need to be captured in the CRF unless their use falls outside of 
expected dosages and/or frequencies of administration. 
Confidential  Page 57 12 January 2021 ProKidney Renal Autologous Cell Therapy (REACT) REGEN -003 v1.7 
 
 
   • Second (Final) REACT  injection until 6 months of follow -up: Record any 
medications taken until [ADDRESS_828991]  injection procedure do not need to be captured in the CRF 
unless their use falls outside of expected dosages and/or frequencies of administ ration. 
• 6 months of follow- up through the EOS Visit:  Record CKD -specific medications, 
that may affect renal hemodynamics and medications that may affect serum creatinine 
measurements. Record medications used to treat any AE documented in the CRF. 
7.2.5.  Funduscopic Exam of Retina  
This exam should be completed at screening, month 12, and month 24/EOS to monitor for diabetic 
retinopathy of both eyes. Retinal photography should be collected and kept within the patient 
records and any worsening from baseline should be reported as an AE if not already docume nted in 
medical history.  
7.3. Laboratory Assessments  
Planned clinical laboratory evaluations are listed in  Table  12. Analyses will be conducted by a 
central laboratory, except as noted. The schedule for collecting biological sample s during the study 
are shown in  Table  2.

Urine  will be  collected  over two different time  periods: 24- hour collection and “spot” urine. Spot 
urine collections will be used for dipstick urinalysis (test stick) assessments. The schedules for 
collecting each type of urine sample are shown in  Table  2. To provide a comprehensive pi[INVESTIGATOR_622512], both total protein and albumin will be assessed in all sampl es. 
Confidential  Page 59 12 January 2021 ProKidney Renal Autologous Cell Therapy (REACT) REGEN -[ADDRESS_828993]  injection is a known and foreseeable risk to subjects 
participating in this study. Therefore, hemoglobin and hematocrit will be measure d by [CONTACT_779]’s  
local laboratory before and after each procedure and compared to baseline l evels. Other bleeding 
parameters ( e.g., APTT, PTT -INR, platele ts) also will be measured throughout the study. 
7.3.4.  Virus Serology  
The biopsy cores obtained from each subject will be used for the expansion and sel ection of SRC. 
Contamination with HIV, HBV, and/or HCV would prevent ProKidney from manufacturing 
REACT  product for that subject. Therefore, each subject will undergo testing for viral  blood-borne 
pathogens, including HIV, HBV, and HCV. 
7.3.5.  Drug Screen  
Consistent with Exclusion Criterion #24 (See Section 5.2), subjects  are no t eligible  to participate  in 
the study if they have an “…active history of … drug abuse that, in the judgment of the 
Investigator, would impair the subject’s ability to comply with the protocol.” Therefor e, subjects 
will undergo testing for drugs of abuse. 
7.3.6.  Pregnancy Screen  
A qualitative urine pregnancy test will be performed at the site using a test- strip. If the test is 
positive, then a confirmatory test will be performed by [CONTACT_20019]. If site practices do 
not accept the results of a test -strip, then a urine sample should be sent to the central laboratory for 
analysis. Post-menopausal women with a confirmatory FSH test do not have to undergo pregnancy 
testing throughout the study. 
7.3.7.  Research Samples  
Research  samples  (serum/plasma and  urine) will be collected, frozen, and stored for the evaluation 
of novel biomarkers. Participating subjects can opt out of long-t erm storage  of their unused 
specimens  during the informed consent process  or at any time during the study ( Section [IP_ADDRESS] ).  
7.4. Renal Imaging  
7.4.1.  Ultrasound 
Renal ultrasound will be performed at the Screening Visit to  verify subject eligibility ( i.e., no 
evidence of renal tumors, polycys tic kidney disease, renal cysts or other anatomic abnormalitie s that 
would interfere with the REACT  injection procedure) along with obtaining a baseline echogenicity 
reading. Ultrasound will also be performed following the in-patient renal biopsy on D ay [ADDRESS_828994]  injection(s) on Day 0 and Day 1 with the aim of monitoring 
possible, subclinical AEs. Findings from the ultrasound (e.g., resistance index, length, et c.) will be 
recorded on the CRF. An ultrasound may be conducted at other times, in the judgment of the 
Investigator, if needed for additional safety evaluation(s). 
7.4.2.  Computerized Tomography 
Computerized tomography (CT) must be used in conjunction with ultrasound during the REACT  
injection procedure, according to the u sual standards of care at the investigative site.  Use of 
fluoroscopic CT may be used in conjunction with ultrasound. 
Confidential  Page 60 12 January 2021 ProKidney Renal Autologous Cell Therapy (REACT) REGEN -[ADDRESS_828995] will be performed from the Screening Visit through D ay -1 before 
renal biopsy to determine kidney size and volume. During the site initiation visit, t he MRI process 
will be defined for each site, depending on the MRI equipment available. Genera lly, a 1.5-T unit 
should be used. MRI imaging studies will help determine kidney volume (for dosing calculati ons). 
MRI will be performed using standard sequences without injection of contrast agents . Renal volume 
measurements may be calculated, for example, using a fast 3D gra dient - echo sequence, VIBE, with 
an acquisition time of 22 seconds and sp atial resolution of  2 x 1.4 x 1.2 mm. Imaging parameters 
will be recorded in the source documents and CRF. A total of two MRIs will be performed on 
patients.  
7.4.4.  Renal Scintigraphy  
Renal scintigraphy will be used to assess left and right kidney function using the radioa ctive tracer 
99mTc- dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) or Tc99m MAG3 (Mercaptoacetyl triglyci ne). This 
method is considered as the most reliable for measuring renal cortical functi on and is the preferred 
agent for this clinical trial. If the site standard practice  is to use a radiopharmaceutical other than 
99mTc-DMSA or Tc99m MAG3 then the site must discuss their procedure with ProKidney or t he 
Medical Monitor prior to site  initiation. If the site’s standard practice is considered suffi ciently 
equivalent to the procedure using 99mTc-DMSA or Tc99m MAG3, then the site will be allowed to 
follow their procedure. In this case, a copy of the site’s procedure wil l be signed/dated by [CONTACT_622543]’s regulatory binder. All patients in this 
study will receive five renal scintigraphy studies. Renal scintigraphy will be performed befor e the 
first REACT  injection, before the last REACT  inject ion, at the 6- Month Visit after the last REACT  
injection, at the [ADDRESS_828996] will remain supi[INVESTIGATOR_050] f or 4 hours with 
monitoring of hemoglobin, blood pressure, gross hematuria, abdominal/flank pain, and f lank 
ecchymosis. As long as any biopsy-related AEs have resolved, stabilized, or ret urned to baseline, 
the subject can be discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_622513]. Importantly, any pain medication administered after  the renal biopsy should be 
selected carefully, avoiding medications with nephrotoxic potential. 
Confidential  Page 61 12 January 2021 ProKidney Renal Autologous Cell Therapy (REACT) REGEN -[ADDRESS_828997]  injection, 
then he/she will not be treated with REACT  but will be followed until resolution of the event(s) and 
then discontinued from the study. 
7.5.2.  REACT  Injection  
Before performing the REACT  injection, the operating physician will evaluate the subject as 
follows: 
• Perform a physical examination to determine the feasibility of t he procedure.  
• Evaluate bleeding parameters, including coagulation panel, PTT- INR, platelets, 
hemoglobin, hematocrit, and other pertinent laboratory studies. 
− Note: Hemorrhage following REACT  injection is a known and foreseeable risk to 
subjects participating in this study. Therefore, hemoglobin and hematocrit w ill be 
measured before and after each REACT  injection per the site’s standard practice 
and compared to baseline levels. 
• Review imaging  studies, including ultrasound, MRI, and CT or fluoroscopic CT, to 
determine route of  access, depth of kidney, and appearance of cortical -medullary 
junction. 
• Map potential REACT  cell deposition sites.  
• Determine classification and associated perioperative /post-operative risk according to 
the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) with respect to airway assessment, 
medical history, allergies, and medications. 
• Interview the subject and the subject’s family/supporters to discuss the p rocedu re, its 
risks and possible complications. Answer questions and obtain written informe d consent. 
Prophylactic antibiotics will be given intravenously according to site standar d practice. An initial 
CT scan may be ordered, if necessary, to evaluate adjacent vis cera, renal location, and the presence 
of renal cysts. A CT scan must be used in conjunction with ultrasound to locate the cortical -
medullary junction. 
REACT  is targeted for injection into the kidney cortex via a needle/cannula and syringe compati ble 
with cell delivery. The intent is to introduce REACT  via penetration of the kidney capsule and 
deposit REACT  into multiple sites of the kidney cortex. Initially, the kidney capsule will be pi [INVESTIGATOR_622514] a 15- to 20- gauge trocar /access cannula inserted appro ximately [ADDRESS_828998]  will be at a rate of 1 to 2 m L/min. After each 1-to-2-minute  
injection, the inner needle will be retracted along the needle course within the  cortex to the second 
site of injection, and so forth, until the needle tip reaches the end of the access ca nnula or until the 
entire REACT  product has been injected. Using a percutaneous delivery approach, place ment of the 
access cannula /trocar and delivery needle will  be performed using direct, real- time imaging . A CT 
scan must be used in conjunction with ultrasound for the REACT  injection procedure . 
During the procedure, moderate conscious sedation will be employed; vital signs w ill be measured 
continuously. REACT  injection will cease if there is imaging evidence of cell extrava sation into 
Confidential  Page 62 12 January 2021 ProKidney Renal Autologous Cell Therapy (REACT) REGEN -[ADDRESS_828999] for track embolization. During removal of the oute r cannula (trocar), 
the site of the renal cortex puncture and needle track throug h the retroperitoneum will be embolized 
with absorbable gelatin particle/pledgets (e.g. , Gelfoam® [[COMPANY_007]]) or fibrin sealant  (e.g. , TISSEEL 
[Baxter]) or other suitable agent to prevent excessive renal bleeding. 
Upon completion of the procedure, non- contra st CT scan or ultrasound with color Doppler 
evaluation will be performed to image puncture site cell injection and any he matoma or bleeding 
events. The subject will be monitored for [ADDRESS_829000] practice.

8. SAFETY ASSESSMENTS AND MANAGEMENT
8.1. Adverse and Serious Adverse Eve nts 
8.1.1.  Definition of Adverse Events  
An A E is the developme nt of an undesirabl e medica l condition (including abnorma l laboratory 
findings ) or the deterioration of a pre-existing medica l condition following or during exposur e to a 
study treatment, whethe r or not considered to hav e a causa l relationship with study procedure s or 
the investigationa l product. A pre-existing condition i s a clinica l condition (including a condition 
being treated ) that is diagnosed befor e the subjec t signs the Informed Conse nt Form and i s 
documented a s part of the subject’ s medica l history. Pre-existing conditi ons that are stabl e or 
unchanged should not be considered A Es. 
The Investigat or is responsibl e for ensuring tha t all AEs observed by t he Investigat or or reported by 
[CONTACT_70579] t that occu r from the day of t he biopsy procedur e through [ADDRESS_829001] ’s medical  record  as well as the CRF 
provided by t he Spons or or its designee. 
Treatment -emergent  adverse events  (TEAEs)  are defined  as any AE that started  after the first 
injection of REACT  or started  prior  to the first injection  but increased  in severity  or frequenc y after 
the first injection  of REACT . 
Unscheduled visit s may be performed a t any tim e during t he study a s judged necessary by [CONTACT_622544] s and conduc t follow-up on AEs. Evaluati ons and procedure s to be performed 
at unscheduled visi ts will be  at the  Investigator’s  discretion  in consultation  with the Spons or and 
may be based on thos e listed in t he Schedul e of Events. 
The Investigator’ s clinica l judgme nt is used to determi ne whethe r a subjec t is to be removed from 
treatment  due to an AE. 
An AE is considered unexpected if it is not consistent in nature or severity with information 
contained in the current version of the Investigator’s Brochure provided by [CONTACT_1034]. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Definition  of Serious  Adverse Events  
An S AE is an AE that occur s during any phas e of the study ( i.e., ba seline, treatment, washout, or 
follow- up) at any dos e of the investigationa l product, comparator, or placebo, and fulfil s one or 
more of the following: 
•Results in death
•It is immediately life -threatening
•It requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]
•It results in persistent or significant disability or i ncapacity
•Results in a congenital abnormality or birth defect
•It is an important medical event that may jeopardize the su bject or may require medical
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.
All SAEs that occur from the day of the biopsy procedure,  during treatment, or within [ADDRESS_829002]  injection, whether or not they are related to study procedures or the 
Confidential  Page 64 12 January 2021 ProKidney Renal Autologous Cell Therapy (REACT) REGEN -[ADDRESS_829003]’s medical record as wel l as the CRF 
provided by [CONTACT_4885]. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Other Significant Adverse Events  
Significant events of particular clinical importance inclu de SAEs and AEs leading to premature 
discontinuation of subjects from the study. These events will be recorded in the subjec ts’ medical 
records as well as the CRF provided by [CONTACT_4885]. Narratives of the se events may 
be prepared for inclusion in the Clinical Study Report. 
The following sections describe “adverse events of special interest” concer ning procedure- and 
product-related events. Subjects should be carefully monitored for the occurrence of  these potential 
AEs.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Procedure -Related Events  
Post-procedure pain :  If the subject experiences pain following the biopsy or REACT  injection, 
administration of paracetamol or paracetamol -codeine combinations is recommended. More severe 
pain in the loin or abdomen requires ultrasonography to exclude signif icant perirenal hemorrhage. If 
severe pain occurs, administration of opi[INVESTIGATOR_622515]. If analges ic doses higher than the 
maximum authorized doses are required to alleviate pain, then the Investigator mus t perform 
additional clinical evaluations to  ascertain the probable cause(s) of excessive pain.  
Hemorrhage: Following renal biopsy and REACT  injection procedures, subjects undergo regular 
hemoglobin and blood pressure monitoring. Subjects will be confined to bed and monitored for 
maintenance of norm al coagulation indices. If bleeding occurs and the subject is hypotensive 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_383805], a blood transfusion may be considered. If the bleeding is still not c ontrolled, 
surgery may be considered. In rare cases, renal angiography may be performed to iden tify the 
source of bleeding. Coil embolization can be performed during the same procedure. 
Other complications:  In very rare cases, other organs (such as liver, gallbladder and lungs) may 
be penetrated during the biopsy procedure. In these cases, appropri ate treatment and follow - up may 
be discussed with consulting surgeons. 
Death: Deaths resulting from renal biopsies occur in <0.01% of patients .55,56,[ADDRESS_829004] 
inclusion /exclusion criteria will ensure that subjects who may be predisposed to unc ontrolled or 
excessive bleeding will not be enrolled in this trial.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Product -Related Events  
No REACT  product- related events are expected to occur. This assump tion is based on the 
autologous nature of REACT  (i.e., REACT  is manufactured from renal cells isolated from the same 
kidney to which they are being returned), the lack of product-related events observed in pre- clinical 
animal studies, and the lack of spec ific REACT - related events seen during and following implant 
of the first [ADDRESS_829005] , then the 
event will be immediately reviewed by [CONTACT_24318]. 
Confidential  Page 65 12 January 2021 ProKidney Renal Autologous Cell Therapy (REACT) REGEN -003 v1.7 
 
 
   8.2. Adverse Event Intensity and Relationship Assessment  
8.2.1.  Intensity Scale  
Intensity will be assessed by [CONTACT_210923] “Common Terminology Crit eria for Adverse 
Events” (CTCAE) version 4.03, from the US National Cancer Institute (refer to  
http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/CTCAE_4.03_2010-06-14_QuickReference_8.5x11.pdf ). 
If the AE is not included in the CTCAE, then the Investigator will determine the intensit y of the AE 
according to the following criteria: 
• Mild (Grade 1) : The AE is noticeable to the subject but does not interfere with routine 
activity.  
• Moderate (Grade 2) :  The AE interferes with routine a ctivity but responds to 
symptomatic therapy or rest. 
• Severe (Grade 3) :  The AE significantly limits the subject’s ability to  perform routine 
activities despi[INVESTIGATOR_4795]. Severe events are usually incapacitating.  
• Life-Threatening (Grade 4) : The s ubject is at immediate risk of death.  
• Death (Grade 5)  
If the intensity (grade) changes within a day, the maximum intensity (grade) should be re corded. If 
the intensity (grade) changes over a longer period of time, the changes should be recor ded as 
separate events (having separate onset and stop dates fo r each grade).  
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs. Severity is a mea sure of intensity 
whereas seriousness is defined by [CONTACT_622545] (See 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ). Therefore, an AE of severe intensity may not necessaril y meet the criteria for 
seriousness.  
8.2.2.  Relationship Assessment  
An Inve stigator listed on Form FDA [ADDRESS_829006]. If no valid reason exists for suggesting a relationship, then the AE should be clas sified as 
“not related.” If there is any valid reason, even if undetermined, for suspecting a possible cause-
and-effect relationship, then the AE should be considered “possibly related” or “related” to the 
study procedure or investigational product. 
Definitions of relatedness categories are:  
• Not Related : Exposure to the study treatment did not occur, or the occurrence of the AE 
is not reasonably related in time, or the AE is considered unlikely to be related to the 
study treatment.  
• Unlikely Related :  The study treatment and the AE were not closely related in time, 
and/or the AE could be explained more consistently by [CONTACT_622546]. 
• Possibly Related :  The study treatment and the AE were reasonably related in time, and 
the AE could be explained equally well by [CONTACT_622547]. 
Confidential  Page 66 12 January 2021 ProKidney Renal Autologous Cell Therapy (REACT) REGEN -003 v1.7 
 
 
   • Related :  The study treatment and the AE were reasonably related in time, and the AE 
was more likely explained by [CONTACT_622548], or  the 
study treatment was the most likely cause of the AE.  
For the purpose of safety analyses, all AEs judged by [CONTACT_63033] “possibly related” or 
“related” will be considered treatment -related adverse events.  
8.3. Recording and Reporting Adverse Events  
Adverse events spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_3184]/or in response to an open ques tion from 
study personnel, or revealed by [CONTACT_4171], or documented via laboratory reports, im aging reports, 
consult notes, survey instruments and other data collection tools, will be recorded in the s ubject’s 
medical records and CRF provided by [CONTACT_4885]. 
Adverse event s will be reported using standard medical terminology, whenever possible. A 
clinically significant change in laboratory values or vital signs need not be repor ted as an AE unless 
the abnormal change constitutes an SAE and/or leads to discontinuation o f treatment or withdrawal 
from the study. 
For each AE, the Investigator will record the start date, the stop date, the in tensity of each 
reportable event, the Investigator’s judgment of the relationship to the study p rocedure or 
investigational product, the action taken, severity (if applicable), and whether  the event resulted in 
discontinuation of treatment or withdrawal from the study. Follow-up information on any SAE  may 
be requested by [CONTACT_622549]. 
All SAEs must be promptly reported by [CONTACT_622550]  [ADDRESS_829007] information for reporting SAEs appears below: 
Email: [EMAIL_11835]  
SAE Hotline: [PHONE_12905] 
eFax : [PHONE_12906] 
 
ProKidney or its designee is responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory authorit ies of certain 
AEs. It is the Principal Investigator’s responsibility to notif y the IRB /EC of all SAEs that occur at 
the site.  
8.3.1.  Serious Unexpected Drug Reactions  
If there are ser ious, unexpected adverse drug reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) associated with the use of the 
investigational product, ProKidney or its designee will notify the FDA and all participating  
Investigators on an expedited basis and in accordance with applicable regul ations. It is the 
responsibility of the Investigator to promptly notify the IRB /EC and other appro priate institutional 
regulatory bodies of all unexpected serious adverse drug reactions involving risk to human s ubjects. 
Confidential  Page 67 12 January 2021 ProKidney Renal Autologous Cell Therapy (REACT) REGEN -003 v1.7 
 
 
   8.3.2.  Pregnancy  
Pregnancy is neither an AE nor an SAE, unless a complication relating to the pregnanc y occurs. All 
reports of congenital abnormalities /birth defects are SAEs. Spontaneous misca rriages should be 
reported and handled as SAEs. However, elective abortions without complications should not  be 
handled as AEs. 
All pregnancies experienced by [CONTACT_622551]. The course of all pregnanc ies, including 
perinatal and neonatal outcome, regardless of whether the subject has discontinue d participation in 
the study, will be followed until resolution, including follow-up of the health status of the new born 
to [ADDRESS_829008] on the pregnan t female or the 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_15165]. Therefore, female subjects of child-bearing potentia l who are 
planning a pregnancy during the course of the study, or who are not using a highly effective 
method(s) of birth control, or who are unwilling to continue using a highly effective method of bi rth 
control throughout the duration of the study are not eligible to participate in the study. (Refer  to 
Exclusion Criterion # 23; Section  5.2). 
8.4. Data Safety Monitoring Board  
A Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be chartered to  oversee subject safety, especially as 
it relates to unexpected investigational product- related events. The DSMB will minimally co nsist of 
[ADDRESS_829009] enrollment and the 
amount of new data generated. The DSMB will advise ProKidney on aspects concerning the sa fety 
of subjects participating in the clinical trial. Apart from reviewing study data, the DSMB will 
consider feedback from the Sponsor and Investigators. The DSMB will share its recom mendations 
with the study centers, Institutional Review Boards /Ethics Committees, and re gulatory authorities, 
as appropriate. Other specific activities and responsib ilities of the DSMB will be detail ed in the 
DSMB charter.  
8.5. Dose Adjustment Criteria  
The dates for the first [ADDRESS_829010] undergoing his/her second 
REACT  injection. After the third subject has received his/her second REACT  injection, the DSMB 
will meet to assess AEs and other safety parameters obtained to date for these [ADDRESS_829011]  injection as 
well as protocol-specified study evaluations, and/or follow-up procedures. 
Apart from reviewing study data, the DSMB will evaluate relevant feedback from  the Sponsor and 
Investigators. 
8.6. Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_622516], Medical Monitor, DSMB, and Sponsor may remove any subject from the st udy 
for: 
Confidential  Page 68 12 January 2021 ProKidney Renal Autologous Cell Therapy (REACT) REGEN -003 v1.7 
 
 
   • Any clinical AE, laboratory abnormality, intercurrent illness, other medical condition or 
situation whereby [CONTACT_622552].  
• Development of any exclusion criterion. 
If a subject is terminated from the study, EOS assessments should be conducted at  the last visit. 
If any of th e following events occur, no additional subjects can receive REACT  injections until 
review by [CONTACT_622553]: 
• An SAE that is rated as severe or life -threatening and, in the judgment of the 
Investigator, is related to REACT  or study procedures 
• Death of an enrolled subject 
• Similar SAE’s in more than one subject that are related to REACT , in the judgment of 
the Investigator 
• Inability to deliver a minimum of 50% of the dose of REACT  in more than one subject 
due to surgical or other issues 
8.7. Study Suspension or Study Termination  
As long as subjects are enrolled and participating in the study, including follow-up, the  Medical 
Monitor, DSMB, IRB /EC, Sponsor, FDA and other regulatory agencies will review ser ious, 
unexpected, procedure- and product- related AEs.  
Enrollment in the study will be suspended if any patient develops an apparent tumor, w hether in the 
kidney or at a remote anatomic site. A DSMB review will then determine whether or  not study 
amendment or termination is needed. The study will also be suspended in the event that tw o or more 
patients develop a similar unexpected SAE or AEs that are m ore severe than expected with the 
study drug or study procedures.  A DSMB review will then determine whether or not study 
amendment or termination is needed. If a decision is made to suspend or terminate the  study, the 
ProKidney will notify the Investigators /sites and ProKidney as well as the IRB /EC and regulatory 
authorities, as required. 
The DSMB, IRB /EC, Sponsor, Investigator(s), FDA and other regulatory authoritie s, as part of 
their duties to ensure human subject protection, may suspend the study at any time  due to concerns 
for the safety of study subjects. Once the clinical trial is ha lted ( i.e., no new enrollments and no 
further REACT  injections), a report will be submitted to the IRB /EC.  
Confidential  Page 69 12 January 2021 ProKidney Renal Autologous Cell Therapy (REACT) REGEN -003 v1.7 
 
 
   9. STATISTICAL METHODS AND PLANNED ANALYSES  
9.1. Sample Size  
Up to 10 subjects who complete screening procedures and satisfy all inclusion a nd exclusion criteria 
will be enrolled.  
Statistical analyses will be primarily descriptive in natu re and no statistical hypothesis testing is 
planned for the study. Unless otherwise specified, continuous variables will be  summarized by 
[CONTACT_179329]-missing observations (n), mean, standard deviation, media n, 
minimum, and maximum. Categorical variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_622554]. 
9.2. Criteria for Evaluation  
9.2.1.  Analysis Objectives and Endpoints  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Primary  
To assess the safety of REACT  injected in one recipi[INVESTIGATOR_622495]. 
• Primary Endpoint: Procedure and/or product related AEs through [ADDRESS_829012]-
injection.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Secondary  
To assess the safety and tolerability of REACT  administration by [CONTACT_622519]- specific AEs over 
a 24-month period following injection. 
• Secondary Endpoints: Renal -specific laboratory assessments through [ADDRESS_829013] 
injection.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Exploratory 
To assess the impact of REACT  on renal function over a 24-month period following injection and 
on the Quality of Life. 
• Exploratory Endp oints: 1) Clinical diagnostic and laboratory assessments of renal 
structure and function (including eGFR, serum creatinine, and proteinuria) to asse ss 
changes in the rate of progression of renal disease, 2) patient -reported outcomes from the 
Kidney Disease  Quality of Life (KDQOL) and EQ-5D-5L surveys obtained at baseline 
(i.e., after randomization, but before REACT  injection) through [ADDRESS_829014] 
deviation, median, minimum, and maximum for the continuous variables as well as the freque ncy 
and proportion for categorical variables. These summaries will be produced for both the full 
analysis set a nd the injection analysis set. Demographic and baseline characteristic infor mation will 
be presented as descriptive statistics; generating inferenti al statistics is not planned. These data will 
be provided in a tabular listing. 
Confidential  Page 70 12 January 2021 ProKidney Renal Autologous Cell Therapy (REACT) REGEN -[ADDRESS_829015]  injection.  GFR will be estimated using the Chronic Kidney 
Disease Epi[INVESTIGATOR_10444] (CKD-EPI) equation that incorporates bo th serum creatinine 
and Cystatin C. [1] 
Estimated GFR measured at each time point will be summar ized by [CONTACT_622555].  
9.5. Exploratory Analysis  
An exploratory analysis will be conducted to examine potential changes in health- related Quality of 
Life (HR -QoL).  
9.6. Statistical Methods  
Subjects will complete the KDQOL -SF™ survey ( i.e., Kidney Disease and Quality of Life Short 
Form). The KDQOL -SF is a 36 -item, validated,  HR-QoL instrument relevant to patients with 
kidney disease .64   This disease -specific, HR -QoL instrument consists of the following subscales : 
• The “SF -12 measure of physical (PCS) and mental (MCS) functioning” contains items 
about general health, activity limits, ability to accomplish desired tasks, depressi on and 
anxiety, energy level, and social activities.  
• The “Burden of Kidney Disease subscale” contains items about how kidney disease 
interferes with daily life, takes up t ime, causes frustration, or makes the respondent feel 
like a burden. 
• The “Symptoms and Problems subscale” contains items about how bothered a 
respondent feels by [CONTACT_622556], chest pain, cramps, itchy or dry skin, shortness of 
breath, faintness/dizziness,  lack of appetite, feeling washed out or drained, numbness in 
the hands or feet, nausea, or problems with dialysis access. 
• The “Effects of Kidney Disease on Daily Life subscale” co ntains items about how 
bothered the respondent feels by [CONTACT_622557], diet restrictions, ability to work around the  
house or travel, feeling dependent on doctors and other medical staff, stress or worri es, 
sex life, and personal appearance.  
9.7. Safety Analysis  
9.7.1.  Laboratory Evaluations 
Baseline values will be collected immediately prior to REACT  injection. Observed and change from 
baseline laboratory data will be summarized via sample size, mean, standard devi ation, median, 
minimum, and maximum for the continuous variables as well as frequency and proportion for t he 
categorical variables.  Laboratory abnormalities will be defined using the NCI CTCAE grading 
scheme. Abnormal laboratory values will be flagged as above or below the normal range . The 
results of laboratory testing for renal function, specifically sCr, BUN, and urinar y albumin, a re of 
particular interest for this study.  
The incidence of treatment- emergent laboratory abnormalities, defined as values that incr ease at 
least one toxicity grade between baseline and any time post -baseline up to six months following 
REACT  injection, will be summarized. If baseline data are missi ng, then the latest value between 
Confidential  Page 71 12 January 2021 ProKidney Renal Autologous Cell Therapy (REACT) REGEN -003 v1.7 
 
 
   biopsy and injection will be used as the baseline value. If baseline and pre-injection data are  
missing, then any graded abnormality ( i.e., at least a Grade 1) will be considered as treatment - 
emergent. These values will b e summarized for both the full analysis set and the injection analysis 
set. Observed and change from baseline values will be presente d as descriptive statistics; generating 
inferential statistics is not planned. These data will be pr ovided in a tabular lis ting. 
9.7.2.  Adverse Events  
Clinical and laboratory AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regula tory Activities 
(MedDRA) version 18.1 by [CONTACT_1196] (SOC) and Preferred Term (PT). Adver se events 
will be graded using the CTCAE version 4.[ADDRESS_829016] . Summarie s (frequency and proportion) of treatment-emergent AE’s will be pres ented by 
[CONTACT_3592]. Additional summaries will include, but are not limited  to, treatment - emergent AE 
judged to be related to the procedure and/or investigational product, intensity, re ason for subject 
withdrawal, SAEs, and deaths. The numbers of events (occurrence) and the number of  subjects 
(incidence) who experienced treatment -emergent AEs will be reported by [CONTACT_1570]. Adverse 
event data will be provided in a data listing.

The final study protocol, I nvestigator’s Brochure,  subject informed consent, subject recruitment 
materials  (if applicable), and patient-reported questionnaires/surveys (if applicable), incl uding 
respective version dates, must be approved or given a favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_3952] /EC as  
appropriate. A copy of the written approval must be provided to the Sponsor. This documentat ion 
should clearly mention the approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_29925], the subject Informed 
Consent Form, and subject recruitment materials (if applicable), and patient -reported 
questionnaires/surveys (if applicable) along with the respective version dates. The written approval 
and a list  of current  membership,  or Department  of Health  and Human  Services  (DHHS)  Assurance 
Number,  or letter  from the  IRB /EC stating  that the  membership  list is  on file, must be  provided  to 
the Sponsor prior to the release of clinical study supplies to the investigational sit e and 
commencement of  the study.  If any member  of the IRB /EC has direct participation  in this clinical 
trial, written notification regarding his or her abstinence from voting must also be obtained. 
The Investigator must inform the IRB /EC of any amendment to the protocol, provide updates about  
the ongoing trial at intervals (at least annually) specified by [CONTACT_622558] B /EC, and submit 
final study reports to the IRB /EC. In addition, the IRB /IEC must approve all advertisi ng used to 
recruit subjects for the study along with any written information to be provided to subj ects (e.g., 
diaries,  calendars,  patient -reported surveys) and updates to the Informed Consent Form. 
It is the Investigator’s  responsibility  to notify  the IRB /EC of all SAEs  that occur  at his  or her site. 
The Sponsor is responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory authorities of certain sa fety events, 
including unexpected, serious, drug- related  adverse reactions  that occur during the clinical study. 
The Investigator is responsible for notifying its IRB /EC of these unanticipated SAEs . 
Initial IRB approval, and all materials approved by [CONTACT_622559] a nd made available 
for inspection. 
10.3.1.  Subject  Informed Consent  
Informed consent is a process that is initiated prior to the individual’s agreeing t o participate in the 
study and continuing throughout the individual’s study participation. The Investigator will ensure 
that potential participants  (and their families)  are given  full and  adequate  oral and  written  
Confidential  Page 73 12 January 2021 ProKidney Renal Autologous Cell Therapy (REACT) REGEN -003 v1.7 
 
 
   information about the nature, purpose, possible risk(s) and benefit(s) of th e study. IRB-approved 
consent forms explaining study procedures and the investigational product /intervent ion(s) will be 
provided. The Investigator will explain the research study and answer any questions t hat may arise. 
Potential participants should have sufficient time to discuss the study, ask questi ons, and process the 
information during the consent process before deciding whether or not to participa te. 
The rights and welfare of potential subjects will be protected by [CONTACT_622560] d ecide not to participate in the research 
study. Those individuals who agree to enroll must sign and date the current version of the Infor med 
Consent Form prior to starting any study-related procedures, including screening. Subje cts may 
withdraw consent at any time throughout the course of the clinical trial without pena lty or prejudice 
toward future medical care.  
The acquisition of informed consent will be documented in the participant’s medi cal records, as 
required by [ADDRESS_829017] to his/her physician or to other appropriate medical pe rsonnel responsible 
for the subject’s well -being. The Sponsor affirms the subject’s right to protection against invasion 
of privacy. Only a subject identification number and/or initials (where allow ed by [CONTACT_476821]) will identify subject data retrieved by [CONTACT_1034]. However, ProKi dney requires the 
Investigator to permit the Sponsor, its designated representative(s), the I RB /EC, and when 
necessar y, representatives of the regulatory health authorities to review and/or to copy a ny medical 
records relevant to the study. 
10.5. Substantial Amendment to the Protocol  
A substantial amendment to the protocol must be agreed upon in writing by [CONTACT_10577], then 
submitted to and approved by [CONTACT_622561]. It is the responsibility of ProKidney or its designee to ensure compliance with the 
appropriate regulatory requirements.  
Written approval of a protocol amendment is not required prior to implementat ion of changes that 
eliminate an immediate hazard to the study subject; however, approval must be o btained as soon a s 
possible thereafter. Any protocol amendment also must be signed by [CONTACT_24342], who will 
provide a copy to the IRB /EC. 
10.6. Protocol Deviations  
A protocol deviation is any noncompliance with the protocol or GCP requirements. The 
noncompliance may be attributed to the subject, the Investigator, or the site st aff. All protocol 
deviations will be documented and reported by [CONTACT_622562]. ProKidney will work with the site to develop and 
implement any corrective actions to address protocol deviations, as appropriat e. 
Confidential  Page 74 12 January 2021 ProKidney Renal Autologous Cell Therapy (REACT) REGEN -[ADDRESS_829018] be reported to the Sponsor, IRB /EC, and r egulatory 
authorities. 
Although, in principle, no deviations from or changes to the protocol are permitted, under  
emergency circumstances protocol deviations may proceed without prior appr oval from ProKidney , 
IRB /EC and regulatory authorities to protect the rights, safety, and well-being of s tudy subjects. 
Confidential  Page 75 12 January 2021 ProKidney Renal Autologous Cell Therapy (REACT) REGEN -[ADDRESS_829019]’s CRF. Source documen tation supporting the CRF data should 
indicate the subject’s participation in the study and document the dates and detail s of study 
procedures, AEs, and subject status. 
When a subject completes the study, the Investigator must review and sign the CRF indic ating that 
he/she has reviewed the completed CRF and pertinent clinical data for that  subject and that, to the 
best of his/her knowledge, all data recorded in the CRF accurat ely reflect the subject’s clinical 
performance in the study. 
11.1.2.  Study Monitoring  
Befo re an investigational site can enter a subject into the study, a representative of  ProKidney or its 
designee will visit the investigational study site to:  
• Determine the adequacy of the facilities.  
• Discuss with the Investigator(s) and other personnel their responsibilit ies under the 
protocol as well as the responsibilities of ProKidney. This will be documented in a 
Clinical Study Agreement between ProKidney and the Investigator. 
During the study, a study monitor appointed by [CONTACT_622563]-site monitoring visits as described in the Study Monitoring Pla n. 
Monitoring and auditing procedures, approved by [CONTACT_1034], will ensure that the study is 
conducted in accordance with the protocol and regulatory requirements while ensuring t he safety of 
all study subjects. Apart from on- site visits, the monitor will maintain frequent communication wit h 
the Investigator and site personnel via letters, e-mails, telephone, and FAX . 
Duties of the monitor includ e, but are not limited to:  
• on-site review of the CRFs for completeness and clarity  
• confirmation that the facilities remain acceptable  
• confirmation that investigational product accountability checks are being per formed 
• confirmation that AEs and SAEs are properly documented in the CRFs, and that any 
SAEs have been forwarded to ProKidney or its designee and the IRB /EC 
• recording and reporting of any protocol deviations not previously sent to ProKidney, the 
IRB /EC, and regulatory authorities, as required 
• clarification of administrative matters  
Confidential  Page 76 12 January 2021 ProKidney Renal Autologous Cell Therapy (REACT) REGEN -[ADDRESS_829020]’s medical records at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7708], and other recor ds relevant to the study. 
Source data verificat ion requires direct access to all original records for each subject. The review  of 
medical records will be performed in a manner that ensures sub ject confidentiality.  
Regulatory authorities and the IRB /EC may request access to a ll source documents for on- site 
inspection or an audit. Likewise, the Sponsor or its designee may conduct a quality assuranc e to 
ensure compliance with GCP and all applicable regulatory req uirements. Direct access to source 
documents must be guaranteed by [CONTACT_737], who will provide support at all  times for these 
activities.  
11.2. Audits and Inspections  
The purpose of an audit or inspection by [CONTACT_1034], regulatory authorities, the IRB  /EC, or other 
appropriate institutional bodies is to systematically and indepen dently examine all  study- related 
activities and documents to determine whether these activities w ere conducted, and the data were 
recorded, analyzed, and accurately reported, in accordance with the protocol, ICH-GCP, and any 
applicable regulatory requireme nts. The Investigator and the site /institution must provide support at 
all times for on -site audits or inspections by [CONTACT_622564], CR Fs, 
and other study documentation. The Investigator must notify ProKidney or its desig nee immediately 
if contact[CONTACT_426] a regulatory agency about an inspection. 
Additionally, the Sponsor or its designee will be allowed to conduct site visits to the  investigational 
facilities for the purpose of monitoring any aspect of the study. The Investiga tor agrees to allow the 
monitor to inspect the drug storage area, study drug stocks, drug accountability records, subjec t 
charts, study source documents, and other records relative to study conduct. 
11.3. Retention of Records  
The Investigator agrees to keep records and those documents that include (but are not  limited to): 
the identification of all participating subjects; medical rec ords; study -specific source documents; 
source worksheets; all original signed and dated Informed Consent Forms; records of  any body 
fluids or tissue samples retained; query responses; and, detailed records of inve stigational product 
accountability to enable evaluations or audits from regulatory authorities, the S ponsor, or its 
designees.  
These documents are to be retained until at least two years aft er the last approval of a marketing 
application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketi ng applications 
in an ICH region, or at least two years have elapsed since the formal discontinua tion of clinical 
development of the investigational therapy. If the Investigator cannot meet thi s obligation, he/she 
must ask the Sponsor for permission to make alternative arrangements; details  of these 
arrangements should be documented. If the Investigator withdraws from the res ponsibility of 
retaining the study records, custody must be transferred to a person willing to acce pt the 
responsibility. ProKidney must be notified in writing if a custodial change occurs .

   12. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
Independent qu ality assurance (QA) and clinical quality control (QC) syst ems are implemented and 
maintained using written standard operating procedures (SOPs) to ensure that the t rial is conducted, 
and data are generated, documented (recorded), and reported in compliance with the pr otocol, ICH-
GCP, and the applicable regulatory requirements. 
To ensure compliance with Good Clinical Practices and all applicable regulator y requirements, 
ProKidney may conduct a quality assurance audit. Refer to Audits and Inspections ( Sectio n 11.2 ) 
for more details regarding the audit process. 
13. PUBLICATION POLICY  
All information regarding the investigational therapy is the confidential property of  ProKidney . The 
Investigator agrees to use this information to conduct the study and will not use it for other purposes 
without written approval from the Sponsor. It is understood that there is an obligation to provide 
ProKidney with complete data obtained during the study. ProKidney retains full rights over a ny 
invention, discovery, or innovation, patentable or not, that may occur during the conduct of the 
clinical trial.  
It is anticipated that the results of this study will be presented at scientific meeting(s) and/or 
published in a peer-reviewed journal(s). A Publications Committee, composed of Investigators 
participating in the study and representatives from the Sponsor, will oversee the public ation and 
presentation of study results, which will reflect the experi ence of all participating clinical sites.  
The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors has adopted a trials- registration policy 
requiring that all clini cal trials be registered in a public database (such a s ClinicalTrials.gov and 
clinicaltrialsregister.eu) as a condition for publication i n member journals. It is the responsibility of 
ProKidney to register the present study in an acceptable clinical trial registry on or before the onset 
of subject enrollment.

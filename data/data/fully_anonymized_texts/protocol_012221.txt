Objectives  We hope to learn the following:  
 Determine if He aling Touch improve s the quality and 
quantity of patient sleep the night before surgery  
 Define any side effects associated with Healing Touch  
 Establish the value of Healing T ouch on  the patient’s  
pain, stress, anxiety and recovery from anesthe sia. 
 Determine if Healing T ouch is associated wit h measures 
of patient satisfaction and cost of care.  
Statistical 
Methodology  Bivariate comparisons will be used to evaluate  differences in b aseline 
variables between Healing Touch a nd con trol groups (ex. age, gender 
and race, also type of surgical procedu re e.g. burn versus other 
reconstructive procedure ). These latter variables are potential 
covariates for secondary analysis. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) or  
Kruskal-Wallis test and Chi-square analysis will be us ed for these 
comparisons. Similarly, the association between outcome  variables and  
baseline variables will be e xamined; correlation and  ANOVA  or Kruskal-
Wallis will be us ed as appropriate.

integrating complementary and alt ernativ e medicine (CAM) into we llness routines and 
treatment practices with increased frequency.1  From acupuncture to zinc, t he portfo lio 
of CAM options is blossoming as evide nced by [CONTACT_279942] n of the N ational Center

Ener gy-derived hea ling such as healing touch (HT)  is  based on principles o f 
quant um physi cs that humans are energetic organisms that occupy a physical 
space.[ADDRESS_341618] a measura ble 
magne tic field. Many integrativ e medicine practitioners believ e that we hav e 
specific energy v ortices that con trol the fl ow of subtle energy in the body (referred 
to as chakras) and that energy travels through t he body alon g vertical pathways 
called meridi ans. Layers of energy within and surrounding t he bo dy are impo rtant 
for health and we ll-being. Disease and injury are believed to be related t o 
disturbances in t he chakras, meridians and energy fiel ds.5-10 In theory, HT uses 
noninv asive hand t echniques to b alance human and environment al energy 
disturba nces, remove biofiel d blockages, restore innate healing forces an d 
reactivate t he mind- body-spi[INVESTIGATOR_279905].6,7,9,10 
 
Bioenergy hea ling is controversial . Whereas t he art of HT has long been 
estab lished, only recently has science begun to explore the bioenergy healing 
realm; hence definitive proof of its c linical val ue is sparse. There is however, go od 
scientific evidence to indicate tha t bioenergy fields exist.4,5,11 Yet n either the ability 
to ma nipulate these energies by [CONTACT_279944], no r the existence of c hakras 
and meridians ha ve been conclusively proven. This lack o f knowledge mak es it 
difficult for professionals to r espond to t he voluminous testimo nials of success. 
Witho ut evidence that eithe r suppo rts or refutes the benef it(s) of energy me dicine, 
health fraud and quackery will prevail. T he probl em is seriou s. Unproven 
remedi es may be ha rmful and waste money, a nd using ine ffective practices m ay 
prevent people fro m getting necessary me dical treatmen t. 
 
The clinical efficacy of H T within conventional me dical scien ce appears t o be in 5 
main areas: reduc tion of anxiety/improvement in mood/well-being,12-20  relief of 
pain,15,16,19- 24 haste ning of wound hea ling,25-27 immun e modulation28,29 and

healed.31,41- 43,75-79 The chro nic nature of postburn and/or postsurgical dyssomnia is 
unsettling in view of its insidious e ffects on quality of life, wound hea ling and 
health. Experts in sleep me dicine have also demonstrated sig nificant 
psychological co nseque nces of sustained sleep inadequacy and sleep 
fragmentation. Sleep disturbances pre dispose individuals, especially children, to 
heightened anxi ety, attenti on-deficit hyperactivity disorder, imp aired mem ory, 
reduced cognition and po or social integration.80-85

Because c linical an d pharmacological modulatio n of postburn sleep disturbance

1.2 Rationale and Risks/Benefit 
     1.2.1 Rationale: Our work is u nique because no one has ev er related                        
electroe ncephalography (EEG) r ecordings of energy to HT. Hea ling touch m ay 
prove  useful in the tre atment of re fractory sleep disorders common during 
recovery and coul d lead to widespread applicatio n worldwide i n terms of it s 
developm ent as a safe, economical and non-inv asive procedure that promotes 
sleep, physiological r estoration and psychologica l well-being. Such findings 
would dovetail nicely with the Affordable Care Act as America transitions to 
value based care, requiring the adoption of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_279907].  
 
1.2.2 Risks/Benefit: This study involves no more than minimal ris k. Ther e may not   
be direct benefit not ed for study subjects; information from this study m ay 
influence t he care of surgical pop ulations in the future. This informatio n is 
commu nicated to participa nts/consenting parents/leg al guardians upon        
study introduction and is not ed up on consent. The risks of this study ar e 
minimal; however, t he potenti al for HT therapy to promote sleep and improv e 
postoperative morbidity in elective surgery pop ulations is novel and signifi cant.  
 
2.0 Objectives: 
There is a fundamental gap in understanding how the energy-based, CAM approach of 
HT can be used to maximize health and improve recovery following disease or injury. 
Whereas the art of HT has long been established, there has been a recent explosion in 
its integration as a therapeutic intervention. However, proof of its mechanistic action and 
clinical value is lacking. Our long-term goal is to expand the capacity for improved 
   
 
                                                                      12                                   Sleep 7 IRB – Version 2.[ADDRESS_341623] which emphasizes value and reduced health care spending. The 
objective of this study is to develop foundational scientific evidence that validates efficacy 
of a standardized HT intervention designed to promote sleep, a proven integral 
component of repair and recovery. These data are critical to advance the science and 
practice of HT, ultimately providing understanding of how this type of CAM can make a 
positive contribution to patient care. Our central hypothesis for this investigation is that 
HT generates improvement in a recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]’s sleep in association with 
electroencephalographic changes. We formulated this hypothesis on the basis of strong 
preliminary data demonstrating that HT has a positive impact on PSG outcomes.  W e 
further postulate that HT and its associated increase in restorative sleep will benefit 
common sources of preoperative stress and/or postoperative anguish (e.g. anesthesia 
emergence, pain, anxiety, nausea). With recognition that well-designed clinical trials of 
HT are sparse; secondary objectives of this application are to produce cost to benefit 
information and to determine if patient satisfaction is enhanced by [CONTACT_279946]. 
 
2.1   The primary objective  of this study is (Aim 1) to determine the safety and efficacy of 
healing touch intervention on improving measures of sleep.   
         With recognition that our original work demonstrating deficits in sleep and quality of 
life outcomes in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_65304], this prospective randomized trial will 
examine a new method for improving sleep. We postulate that HT will safely 
modulate changes that favor enhanced restorative sleep outcomes measured by 
[CONTACT_279947] (TST), sleep efficiency, sleep stages and 
time awake after sleep onset (WASO).  
 
2.2    A s econdary objective  of this study is to establish the value of HT on perioperative 
management of surgery-related outcomes (Aim 2).   
 
The intent of this aim is to evaluate the impact of HT on distress preceding surgery 
as measured by [CONTACT_112344], pain, and laboratory indices of stress. This investigative 
aim will also assess the effectiveness of HT postoperatively in management of 
anesthesia emergence, sedation, anxiety, and pain reflected by [CONTACT_2085], 
psychometric and medication measures of well-being as well as track the incidence 
of postoperative nausea/vomiting. Upon completion of this study objective, it is 
expected that important information will be provided that determines whether HT 
intervention can mediate clinical improvement and comfort measures.   
 
2.[ADDRESS_341624] of care associated with HT (Aim 3). There is a need to ensure the value of 
healthcare services.  Therefore, in addition to safety/efficacy considerations, 
additional key determinants of quality- based surgical care include patient 
satisfaction and financial outcomes.  We will connect satisfaction and cost findings 
to clinical outcomes, with the goal of providing an objective interpretation of 
benefits and costs . These  essential steps will justify (o r contest)  the value of HT  
services within the framework of perioperative clinical practices.  
 
2.4   The rationale of selection of outcome measures (sleep, surgery- related outcomes, 
patient satisfaction and cost of care) is that Healing Touch is expected to provide 
an inexpensive, non-invasive method that will prosper as a safe and efficacious 
adjunctive preoperative treatment.

3.4.1  Study specific recruitment cards, a 1 page flyer and also a patient 
education brochure describing healing touch will be used for marketing.  
Patients requiring surgery will be invited to participate by [CONTACT_279949]/or via a ma iling of related study 
materials to th eir home . Before surgery, a staff member from Patient 
Access may encourage patient or caregiver to look for study information 
when they receive their study packet mailing (per script).  This will occur 
during the normal preoperative phone call.  In addition, a study co-
investigator may contact [CONTACT_279950]) per script who are 
identified as potential candidates. Once study information has be en 
review ed by [CONTACT_102]/fami ly, and t he patie nt/family is agreea ble to 
participate in t he study, a study co-investigator will work with scheduling 
personnel to plan research admission the evening before elective surgery. 
  
3.4.2  Informed consent will be obtained from the participants and/or their legal 
guardians by [CONTACT_279951].  
             [IP_ADDRESS] The conversation is expected to include a thorough discussion of  
            what is expected to happen during the study, risks and benefits of 
            the planned therapy, and any possible alternatives.   
             [IP_ADDRESS] The family will be given a copy of the signed consent form.            
[IP_ADDRESS] For participants who are less than 18 years of age, some of these 
            participants are able to give assent and others are too young.  If it 
            is determined that a participant is able to give assent (generally     
            children 11 years or older), the consenting staff will attempt to       
            explain the study at both the participant’s and the legal guardian’s

         A single blinded stratified random block randomization sche me89 will be 
generated by [CONTACT_4305] (LJ) who will conceal group assignment from 
the blinded polysomnography technician and blinded board certified sleep 
physician as well as the blinded biostatistician (JK) who will analyze the data .  
Intervention assignment will also not be conveyed to the study 
subject/caregiver(s).  The str atification is based on possible influenti al variables 
groupi[INVESTIGATOR_279908] (5 to 11, >11 years) and also acuity (levels 1 and 2) whereby 
[INVESTIGATOR_67147] 1 is defined as same day surgery and observation (e.g. patients are 
technically never admitted as inpatient). Level 2 represents patients admitted for 
≥ 24 hours and therefore assigned an inpatient encounter of surgical procedure. 
Also carefully considered was the study design; the blinding and suitable control 
groups.90-96 Followi ng screening per inclusion/exclusion criteria and upon verbal 
agreement to participate, 200 subjects w ill be randomly assigned to receive one 
of four interventions: hea ling touch, sham, control no presence, or contr ol 
presence.   The subjects will not be informed of group assignment. No study 
procedures will be performed until written informed consent (and assent as 
appropriate) is obtained. The consenting process will take place in a private area. 
The investigator will ask open-ended questions of the consenting 
parent(s)/assenting subjects regarding study methods to determine level of 
comprehension. The consent process including consenting parents/assenting 
subjects verbalization of understanding of the study will be documented in the 
medical record. 
This is a prospective, randomized trial with 4 treatment groups:  
Healing touch (active intervention, focused intention) will be performed by

covariate to be therapi[INVESTIGATOR_279910] e.g. divorce (unpublished findings) therefore 
prior to each HT procedure, the practitioner will complete a stress survey. No 
interpretation of survey results will be made relative to the assigned therapi[INVESTIGATOR_279911].  The HT practitioner will be entered into the model as a fixed 
effect.  Rather, the survey score will be examined during data analysis to 
determine if stress is an effector of HT effectiveness.  HT will begin per

will perform self- centering ex ercises at the patient ’s bedside in orde r to center 
or quiet the practitioner’s own mind, creating an atmosphere devoid of 
anxiety so the practitioner can focus compassionately and with full presence. 
Once centered, the practitioner uses three t echniques in conjuncti on with 
approximately 60 minutes of sof t backgrou nd music during the study 
intervention: 1) Magnetic clearing  (approximately 10 minutes) which cleanses 
the subject’s energy fiel d to assist in releasing emotional debris and fee lings 
of fear, anger , worry an d tension . The practitioner does the energy clearing 
by [CONTACT_7328] 15- 30 ful l length smooth, gentle, continuous passes (usually 
downward and outward direction) with both hands one to six i nches from the 
patient ’s body. 2) Mind Cleari ng (approximate ly 10 minutes) used fo r 
relaxation and to focus o r quiet the patient’s mind . It consists o f the 
practitioner’s hands placed lightly on or above specific sit es around t he hea d,

Sham (placebo treatment) session will also be conducted at comparable time 
and duration as the active intervention and with analogous environmental 
conditions including presence of identical sof t backgrou nd musi c. The sham 
HT aide will be engaged with the subject yet has no experience with or 
knowledge about healing touch. The standardized clinical encounter will 
appear to be similar to the active treatment and the well-trained sham aide 
will interact with the patient in accordance with a standardized, 
choreographed mock routine involving body motions that mimic HT. There 
will be no positive intent or patient contact; instead the sham aide will 
silently count backward from [ADDRESS_341632] media player with ear phone headset with the purpose of 
distracting the sham aide’s mind so that compassionate thoughts are 
circumvented.   
Control presence whereby a research aide who is not familiar with HT will 
be present in the patient’s room from approximately 2200 – 2300. The 
research aide will not engage/interact with the research subject.  A staff 
nurse will inform the patient that the aide is not permitted to converse with 
the subject. The aide will quietly sit in a corner of the patient’s room , 
listening to media player using earphones similar to that described during 
active intervention . Identical sof t backgrou nd music to that used during active 
intervention will be audible to the patient during the approximate 1-hr study 
period. 
Control no presence involves no study aide presence in the room. A course 
of sof t backgrou nd musi c identical to intervention groups will begin at 
approximately 2200.  
 
The sleep technician will document that an experimental procedure was 
performed and note any unexpected occurrences (interruptions, HT side 
effects) at the end of the 1 hour intervention/control period  using the 
demos/safety CRF .  
   
4.1.2   Study duration is from approximately 9 pm (when the electrodes are attached for the 
sleep test) the evening prior to surgery until 8 hours after surgery the following day 
(unless patient is discharged earlier than 8 hours postop).

Manua l for the Scoring of Sl eep and As sociated E vents: Rules, Te rminology an d 
Technical Specificatio ns98 will be used for scoring and interpretati on of sleep 
stages . PSG pro vides comprehensive su mmary repo rts of sleep stages and also 
generates sle ep latency, TST, WASO, arou sals and sle ep efficiency measures . 
Narong Simakajornboon MD, Director of t he CCHMC’s  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_279912]-certified sleep specia list, blinded to experimental conditions, 
will perfor m the specialized data interpretati on. A copy of the sleep test report will 
be provided to study participants. 
 
Patients w ill have vital signs (temperature, r espi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] , heart rate, blood 
pressure) assessed prior to the sleep study and repeated preoperatively (the 
morning of surgery).   Vital signs and vomiting will be assessed in the operating 
room.   Vital signs , and pain score (using an observational scale99 [OPAS ] 
and/or numeric rating [1-10 scale] as appropriate) will be assessed post-
operatively both upon arrival to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) and 
before PACU discharge .  Vital signs , and pain score will also be recorded upon 
arrival to post-recovery patient room and at discharge.  Nausea and vomiting 
will be assessed in the PACU and in the post-recovery patient room. Minutes 
in the OR, PACU and patient room (time from arrival until discharge) will be 
recorded.   
 
Laboratory parameters (C-reactive protein, glucose, cortisol and D25) will be 
obtained (from approximately 5 mL of blood) in t he operating room.  Since ther e 
is a strong argumen t that H T reduces stress and anxi ety, the result s of this 
study could provide data demonstrating improved ho rmonal balance following 
HT intervention. There also exist reports linking sleep with metabolism of 
glucose and vitamin D. 
 
An anxiety test (Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale) w ill be obtained 
preoperatively (in patient unit prior to preoperative meds and repeated in the 
preoperative surgery area).[ADDRESS_341634] recovery patient room (on the floor) will also 
be recorded.   
 
A patient satisfaction survey will be administered post recovery that includes 
questions specific to the HT procedure, sleep and also includes four questions 
identical to that contained in Press Ganey Pediatric Inpatient survey (questions 
B5, D4, K3 and I9; http://www.pressganey.com/ ) to assess contentment with 
overall inpatient care.  
 
Implicit in the definition of economic consequences of healing touch, we will also 
collect select utilization and cost outcome measures including total charges from 
admission to study discharge as well as charges specific to the Post Anesthesia 
Recovery Room.  Labor cost of HT, length of stay in recovery room (number of 
minutes), length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408] (number of hours) and medications administered 
for slee p, anxiety, p ain, itch, nausea, vomiting and anesthetics during the defined 
study period all have high cost implications and thus will be examined as well.

patients will be closely scrutinized by [CONTACT_279954]. Even though 
there are no known serious side effects reported with HT therapy, subjects will be 
screened for dizziness, headache, and restlessness prior to the 
intervention/control session. In addition, subjects will be evaluated during the HT, 
sham and control/presence groups for emotional outburst, muscle spasm and 
restlessness during the study intervention time as well as any changes in the 
status of dizziness or headache following the study intervention period.  
Continued monitoring will occu r until end of study (up to 8 hours postoperatively) 
to assess for persistent treatment effect. 
5.4.2   Any Serious and Unexpected AE and Grade 3 or above, with a reported 
causality of “possible,” “probably,” or “likely” must be reported to the Study PI [INVESTIGATOR_279916]-Investigator in an expedited method.

         trained data manager. T he database has be en in use for 14 years; it will be adapt ed 
for data en try specific to t he new project. The database is stored on SHC’s dedicated 
network driv e. The network is security- and back up- protect ed by [CONTACT_279956] n 
systems on a daily basi s. In addition, t he in dividual study f iles are password 
protected. T he programs are run by t he statistici an an d verifi ed by a research 
investigator. Pri or to embarking on any an alysis, variabl es will be check ed for 
outlyi ng values.  Distributional prope rties of the continuous variables will be 
examined and any transformatio ns necessary f or analysis considered. Bivariat e 
compari sons will follow, to look at differences in ba seline variabl es between HT an d 
control grou ps (ex. age , gender and r ace, also length of time and type of surgical 
procedure e.g. burn versus other reconstructive procedure). The se latter variables 
are potential covariat es for secondary analysis. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) or 
Kruskal-Wallis test and C hi-square analysi s will be used fo r these compariso ns. 
Similarly, t he association between outcome variables and base line variables will be 
examined; co rrelation and ANOVA or Krusk al-Wallis will be use d as appropriate.

possible value. However, this is not feasible f or our sleep outcomes.  A secon d 
approach wo uld be to i nclude those subjects with outcome data, complete case 
analysis. La st observation carri ed forward is al so commo nly used, bu t this method 
can be bi ased, but will be examined. Multiple imputatio n (MI) methods have be en 
proposed92,104,[ADDRESS_341647] a mi ssing data analysis to address the question of bias. I f 
the mi ssing m echanism depends on group a ssignmen t (HT, sham or one of the 
control groups) or other demographic variables, w e will estimate t he bias usin g 
logistic regression. Bias adjusted analyses wo uld then be conduct ed using the 
inverse of t he estimated probab ility of being missing as the weighting factor. We will 
be able to do this by [CONTACT_279957] a weighted genera lized estimating equations (GEE) 
method.107 Thus we will use MI or weighted GEE method as appr opriate, as well as 
complete case ana lysis. In general, i t will be appropriate to use generaliz ed linear 
random e ffects mixed mod el for analysis. This will a llow f or repeat ed nature of t he 
outcome variables, and specification of t he appropriate link function, dependent up on 
the type of outcome variabl e. SAS PROC G ENMOD may be used fo r these ana lyses 
and using PRO C GLIMMIX wo uld also a llow inv ocation of the GEE metho d if 
required . As mentioned above, bivariate relatio nships between outcom e variables 
and independe nt variables will be examined ; this w ill also be in preparation f or 
consideration of any secondary analyses incorporating covariates and confounders. 
Variables consider ed as potential covariates in an initial model w ill either be thos e 
considered c linically signifi cant irrespectiv e of the statistical association and thos e 
associated wit h the outcome an d independe nt variabl e of interest at p <0.15. Inclusion 
in final models w ill depend up on statistical sig nificance (p<0.05) or e ffect of removal 
of the variable on the beta coefficien t (>10% change) on the independent variabl e of 
interest. Age and gender w ill be considered c linically meaningful an d will be retained

8.3 Primary Study Endpoints  
8.3.1 Statistical An alysis (Primary Objective) 
The primary treatment endpoint for Aim 1 will be generated from PSG.  Group 
comparisons will be made for total sleep time, sleep efficiency, REM, WASO and 
spectral analysis of C3/C4 delta waves, using a generaliz ed linear random e ffects 
model. S econdary analyses wil l involve addi ng appropriate covariat es to the 
   
 
                                                                      22                                   Sleep 7 IRB – Version 2.1 
         model . Age and gender will be retaine d. Potential covariates i nclude prior 
experience with HT, me dication usage , frequency of random disturbances (such 
as parents or other caregivers enteri ng the room, cell phones) and number o f 
prior surgical procedures. The same approach w ill be use d to examin e 
hormones, anes thesia emergence, anxiety, and p ain scales (Aim 2), t he 
advantage is tha t the appropriate link func tion may be app lied and we can 
account fo r the repeat ed nature of t he desig n.

of 50 per group for 80% power to detect a difference of [ADDRESS_341651] and type I error rate of 0.016 to account 
for multiple testing. Similarly for sleep efficiency, we hypothesize a difference of 
2% whereas in a previous study we observed a difference of 10%.[ADDRESS_341652] a difference of 7% with a 
standard deviation of 15, 2-sided test and type I error rate of 0.016, to account 
for comparing HT to the [ADDRESS_341653] deviation of 30, power of 
80% and a 2-sided test. For WASO, with an assumed standard deviation of 50, a 
type 1 error rate of 0.016, a power of 80% and a 2-sided test, a difference of 25 
minutes will require 50 subjects in each group , producing a total sample size of 
200 subjects.

Analysis wil l follow the general approach and then the same specific approach as 
described f or Aim 1, looking at di fferences in outcomes among grou ps utilizing 
generalized linear models. Using this methodology we will be able to examine the 
differences over time baseline to post recovery, examining the change between time

Using our validation information for the OPAS pain assessment scale107 with [ADDRESS_341654] a power of > 80% to detect  a reduction in pain scale of 
0.[ADDRESS_341655] deviation of 0.52, using a type I error rate of 0.016 (to account 
for the multiple testing) and 2-sided test. Given the 0.[ADDRESS_341656] 80% power to detect a difference 
of 69% in the control versus 40% in the HT group with a 2-sided test and type I error 
rate of 0.05. However after accounting for the multiple testing, using type I error rate 
of 0.016, the power is reduced to 70% with the 50 subjects per group estimated for 
the proposed study. Turner et al20 reported on pain after dressing change in older 
adolescents and adults.  In their randomized trial of therapeutic touch; a 23% 
decrease in anxiety was detected in the intervention group. If we assume that we will 
see this level of decreased anxiety in the HT group compared to the control and also 
assume an effect size of 0.7 and a type I error of 0.16, the 50 subjects per group 
(estimated for Aim 1) would yield 85% power for our analysis of anxiety. 
 
8.3.3 Statistical Analysis (Aim 3) 
The data analytic plan will follow that established for Aims [ADDRESS_341657] to charge ratio (CCR).  Because cost fluctuates over time, the 
annual cost to charge ratio (obtained from Shriners Headquarters) will be used to 
calculate and apply CCR to charges pertinent to this study in order to determine if 
the expense of a 1 hour HT session translates to a change in dollars expended in 
PACU care, total length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_279923] (ex. 
anxiety/pain/itch/anti-nausea medication expense). Cost-benefit analysis comparing 
those with HT versus no HT and by [CONTACT_279958].  An expert in health 
cost/economics will be consulted where necessary for the latter analysis. 
 
Unfortunately we have no published data with respect to satisfaction or cost analysis. 
We will be able to detect an effect size of at least 0.[ADDRESS_341658], a type 1 error rate of 
0.016 and power is 80%. A power of 80% could be maintained with correlations as 
low as r=0.20.

compensation for time or travel.

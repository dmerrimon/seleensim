radial artery is unknown. There are no studies comparing distal radial artery access to proximal 
radial artery access.  
5.   STUDY OBJECTIVES  
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate hand function following distal radial artery 
access  compared to proximal artery access in patients undergoing cardiac catheterization .  
Hand function will be assessed by:  
• QuickDASH  questionnaire  
• Hand grip test  
• Thumb forefinger pi[INVESTIGATOR_127914] a pi[INVESTIGATOR_127918], hematoma, bleeding, rates of radial artery occlusion

6.   STUDY DESIGN  
This is a prospective, randomized, single -center clinical trial.   
This study will assess the outcomes of hand function utilizing th e QuickDASH  questionnaire, 
hand strength using  the hand grip test, and the thumb and forefinger pi[INVESTIGATOR_127919]. R ates of radial artery occlusion in patients undergoing card iac catheterization using 
dRA compared to  pRA  will be analyzed  using ultrasound doppler at 1 month and 1 year .

7.  ASSESSMENT OF HAND FUNCTION  
Hand function will be assessed by [CONTACT_716]:  
1. QuickDASH  questionnaire   
The DASH outcome measurement is used around the world by [CONTACT_127930] a 
tool for self -reported outcome concerning upper -limb musculoskeletal disorders  (Hudak P) . It 
consists of two components: symptom questions of 30 items with scores from 1 to 5, and 
optional high performance (sport/music or work) section of 4 items also with scores of 1 to 5.

 The optional modules which concern sport, music or work are not use d as those are mainly 
utilized to identify the specific limitations by [CONTACT_127931].  
This study will be using the abbreviated, Quick DASH  questionnaire.  The purpose of the 
QuickDASH is to use 11 items to mea sure physical function and symptoms . It decreases 
responder and data entry burden while maintaining a high degree of correlation to the original 
length DASH.

 The lead statistician will use a random number generator to produce a randomization scheme that 
will be used by [CONTACT_9137](s) to allocate study participants to distal or proximal access  
study arms after informed consent is obtained , all inclusion/exclusion is assessed , and the 
participant is found to be eligible for the study.  
Participants randomized to proximal access will receive conventional access procedure according 
to standard of care.  
9.[ADDRESS_144257] the procedure as follows  (Kiemeneij) . 
Patients will receive appropriate peri -procedural antiplatelet and anticoagulation medications 
according to standard hospi[INVESTIGATOR_13707].  
 
The left or the right upper a rm is placed comfortably on a cushion on the ipsilateral side  of the 
patient. The hand is placed in a mid -supi[INVESTIGATOR_127926] . For right distal radial access, the right 
wrist rests on a comfortable underground which brings the wrist in passive ulnar flexion. The 
patient is asked to bring the thumb under the other four fingers. This brings the artery more to the 
surface which all ows easier puncture.  After disinfection, the patient is covered with a sterile 
drape. A brachial drape  is applied to the hand exposing  the anatomical snuff box and the 
proximal radial.  
 
Under ultrasound guidance, l ocal an esthesia is applied by [CONTACT_127934] 5cc of 
lidocaine  filling the radial fossa.  The puncture will be performed at the point of maximal 
pulsation proximal in the anatomical snuffbox. If this fails, a puncture more distal, just outside 
the snuffbox can be attempted. The pun cture is preferably done with the traditional radial needle . 
After successful anterior wall puncture a radial sheath wire is advanced . Proper position is 
verified by [CONTACT_127935]’t traverse the palmar arch . This 
is followed by [CONTACT_127936] a hydrophilic sheath . The size of the sheath used will be 
documented (5 or 6 french radial sheaths).  In order to prevent damage to the tip of the introducer 
and sheath, which might damage the artery, a small skin incision can be  made followed by 
[CONTACT_127937]. After administration of a spasmolytic cocktail containing 200 -400 mcg of 
nitroglycerin and 5 mg of verapamil , the operator can take up a position at the level of the 
patient’s knees. The choice of wire is at discretion of the operator. In case of left sided access, 
usually the wire encounters some resistance at the flexed left elbow. Careful manipulation of the 
wire direction with the tip of the catheter will usually solve the problem. If necessary a 
hydrophilic wire under fluoroscopy, can be used with special attention not entering small side 
branches in order to prevent perforation.  
 
Hemostasis is performed  using a radial hemostatic band, but with the least possible pressure and 
the shortest possible time (patent hemostasis). Technique, device used , and time will be  recorded 
in the electronic case report form (e-CRF).   Following the procedure, the patient is free to use 
both arms. No special supportive slings or other mobility limitation measures are required.

Participants will not receive any compensation for participating in this study.  
 
11.  COSTS  
Participants will not incur any additional research -related costs due to study participation. 
Subject  or their insurance company will be required to pay for all expenses related to regular care 
including procedure  and other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10422].  
 
12.  RISK AND BENEFITS TO PARTICIPANTS  
12.1.  Potential Benefits  
There is no guarantee of direct benefit to the subjects  who participate in this study . There is a 
possibility that  dRA will reduce the risk of bleeding and radial artery occlusion  as well as 
improve patient comfort.  Future  patients may benefit from the knowledge gained.  
 
12.2.  Potential Risks  
12.2.1 Physical Risks  
Possible risks  include  loss of sensory function  in part of the hand if the cutaneous nerve running 
in the anatomical snuffbox becomes damaged, distal embolization can result in digital ischemia 
and occlusion of the branch supplying the scaphoid bone can result in bone necrosis.  
A study with 656 patients reported an incidence of distal radial artery occlusion of 1.5% , 
haematoma of wrist and forearm  (0,8%), edema  (0.2%), numbness (0.6%), dissection (0.3%), 
arteriovenous fistula (0.2%), transient ischemic attack  (0.2%), stroke (0.2%), aneurysm (0.2%), 
death (0.5%)  (Kaledin AL, 2014;27) . 
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Al-Azizi  IRB#  
019-504 
  
13 October 24, 2022 ; version 1. 3 
 A skilled and experienced operator  minimiz es such complications.  Operators with adequate 
experience in distal radial access at the dis cretion of the Principal I nvestigator are eligible to 
participate .  
 
12.2.2 Psychosocial & Privacy Risks  
Any time information is collected there is a potential for loss of confidentiality. Every effort will 
be made to keep participant’s information confidential, however this cannot be guaranteed. 
Participation in research study may make participants feel unco mfortable. Participants will be 
informed that they may refuse to participate or stop their participation at any time without effect 
on future medical treatment  or relationship with the treating physician . 
 
12.2.3  Adverse Event Reporting  
An Adverse Event ( AE) is any untoward sign, symptom or medical condition occurring at any 
time after the subject receives his/her procedure , even if the event is not considered  to be related 
to the study . Abnormal laboratory values or test results constitute AEs only if they induce 
clinical signs or symptoms, are considered clinically significant, or require therapy.  
The adverse  events that will be monitored and reported from the start  of the study procedure 
until 1 year after the index procedure  are com plications related to the procedure which include : 
• Bleeding  
• Hematoma  
• Radial Occlusion  
 
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is an undesirable sign, symptom or medical condition which:  
• is fatal  
• is life threatening  
• requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• constitutes a congenital anomaly or a birth defect  
• is medically significant, in that it may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed above  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_127927]:  
• treatment, which was elective or preplanned, for a pre -existing condition that is unrelated 
to the indication under study and did not worsen  
• treatment on an emergency, outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the 
definitions of serious given above and not resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_127928].   
 
13. RISK/BENFIT ASSESSMENT  
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Al-Azizi  IRB#  
019-504 
  
14 October 24, 2022 ; version 1. 3 
 Local hematoma formation or prolonged compression may cause sensory damage or ischemia 
after radial access interventions. Distal radial access  allows the arm to stay in a more natural and 
comfortabl e position for the patient and may reduce the risk of bleeding and artery occlusion. 
Advancing the understanding of distal radial access procedures  will contribute to potentially 
easier and safer peri -procedural management  of patients undergoing cardiac catheterization . 
 
14.   STATISTICAL METHODS  
14. Statistical Methods  
Patient demographics and characteristics will be reported and compared between the radial distal 
access (rDA) and proximal distal access (pDA) cohorts. Continuous variables will be reported as 
means ± standard deviations or medians [quartile 1, quartile 3] , if skewed. Categorical variables 
will be reported as frequencies and percentages. Differences between demographic and clinical 
variables, as well as safety and compliance, will be assessed via two sample t -tests and Chi -
square tests (or Wilcoxon’s Rank S um test and Fisher’s Exact test), as appropriate.  
 
14.1 Analysis of Primary Composite Outcome  
The primary composite outcome of hand function will be defined utilizing the average Z -score 
approach (O’Brien, 1984; Sun, 2012) . The average z -score for each subject is calculated as the 
average of the z -scores of the differences between pre - and [ADDRESS_144260]’s hand included in the composite outcome are: (a) the Quick DASH 
questionnaire score (0 -100) calculated as [(sum of n responses / n) – 1] * 25, (b) Thumb and 
forefinger pi[INVESTIGATOR_127929] (kg), and (c) hand grip strength test (kg). The average of the  three 
z-scores are then compared between rDA and pDA using the Wilcoxon rank -sum test.  
 
14.[ADDRESS_144261] (or Fisher’s exact test). The rate of complications (including 
occurrence of hematoma, bleeding, radial artery occlusion, and complications of vascular access) 
per subject will be compared between the study cohorts u sing a Poisson Exact test.  
 
14.3 Exploratory Objectives  
Associations with radial artery occlusion will be explored using a logistic regression model and 
adjusted for significant confounders and study cohort if the event rate for occlusion allows for a 
multivariable model.

composite outcome of hand function. A small clinical effect is defined as a 10% ± 10% change 
in pre - to post -operation scores in at least one of the three tests for one of the study cohorts. 
Results from the Monte Carlo study indicate that a sample size of n=[ADDRESS_144263] 80% power under a correlation of 0.3 between the three tests. Allowing for a 
loss-to-follow -up rate of 15%, the total number of patients that should be enrolled for the entire 
study is at l east 296 (148 per arm).  
 
14.[ADDRESS_144264] (IRB ). 
Amendments affecting the safety of subjects, the scope of the investigation, or the scientific 
quality of the study require additional approval by [CONTACT_1201]. Examples of amendments requiring 
such approval are:  
1. A significant change in the study design (e.g., addition or deletion of a control group)  
2. An increase in the number of invasive procedures to which subjects are exposed  
3. Addition or deletion of a test procedure for safety monitoring  
These requirements for approval should in no way prevent any immediate action from being 
taken by [CONTACT_127938].

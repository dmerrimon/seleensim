Amendment 6: 06-DEC -2021  
This amendment is considered to be substantial based on the criteria set forth in Article 
10(a) of Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of the 
European Union.  
 
Overall Rationale for Amendment 6:  
 
Non-pharmaceutical interventions  (NPIs ) taken to prevent COVID -19 transmission 
(e.g.,  masks, lockdowns, physical distancing)  have led to an observed reduction in the 
rate of exacerbations among individuals with COPD. Given that the primary study 
outcome and eligibility criteria for this study are based on an exacerbation rate, the 
observed reduction in the rate of COPD exacerbations has affected (i) the collection of 
exacerbation data among enrolled participants and (ii) the recruitment of participants into 
the study, respectively.  
 
The ration ale for this amendment is two-fold. First , based on the presumption that the 
COPD exacerbation rate is e xpected t o progressively return to pre -COVID -19 levels 
following the  lifting of NPIs , this amendment will extend the allowable treatment 
duration to beyond 52 weeks and up to 104 weeks to maximize  the opportunity for 
collection of exacerbation data. Second , to further mitigate  the effects of a 
lower -than-expected exacerbation rate and to maintain sufficient study power,  this 
amendment will permit the s tudy population  to increase up to 1400 participants , if 
warranted , based on future blinded sample size re -evaluat ions.  
 
A summary of changes is described in the table below.

an extended  treatment 
duration beyond 52 weeks and 
up to 104 weeks.  Updates to the 
treatment duration 
necessitated a change 
in the study schema.  
Section 1.3 – Schedule of 
Activities (SoA)  
 
 A second SoA table was 
added (Secti on 1.3.2) to 
reflect procedures for 
participants enrolled in an 
extended treatment duration 
beyond 52 weeks and up to 
104 weeks.  An extended treatment 
duration maximizes the 
opportunity for data 
collection on 
exacerbations.  
An explanation was added 
under  Section 1.3 to 
differentiate the two SoA 
tables  (Section 1.3.1 and 
Section 1.3.2)  and explain 
when ‘IP Conclusion’ and 
‘Study Conclusion’ dates will 
be communicated to the study 
sites.  To highlight the 
difference between the 
two SoA tables  and that 
study sites will be 
provided with 
information to plan 
each participant’s Exit 
Visit.  
Section 1 .1 – Synopsis  
  
Section 4 .1 – Overall 
Design  
 
Section 9 – Statistical 
Considerations  Updates were made to the 
number of randomized 
participants, which can 
increase up  to 1400 
(approximately 700 per 
group).  
 Future blinded sample 
size re-evaluations  may 
warrant an increase in 
the size of the study 
population to  maintain 
sufficient study power.  
 
Section 1.1 – Synopsis  
  
Section 4.1 – Overall

Section 4.2 – Scientific 
Rationale for Study Design  
 Wherein treatment duration 
was discussed, u pdates were 
made to reflect the extension 
of the treatment duration to 
beyond [ADDRESS_288794] the updated 
study design .  
Section 1.1 – Synopsis  
 In the ‘Overall Design’, the 
first paragraph was updated to 
state the study treatment 
duration will be dependent on 
a number of factors discussed 
in Section 4.4.  To reference the 
section of the protocol 
that provides details 
related  to study 
treatment durations for 
participants.

104 weeks  (Section 4.4.2) . 
The ‘End of Study’ definition 
(Section 4.4.3) was updated to 
reference the SoA for 52 
weeks (Section 1.3.1).   The updated study 
design (52 weeks 
versus beyond 52 
weeks) warranted a 
differentiation of these 
definitions.  
Section 1.3.1 – SoA for the 
First 52 Weeks  Table footer ‘a’ was updated,

informed consent is 
signed.  
For run -in failures, the bullet 
regarding the collection of 
details on COPD medications 
in the [ADDRESS_288801] paragraph regarding 
re-screening of participants 
was updated.  To clarify that 
re-screening of both 
screen failure and 
run-in failure 
participants is 
permissible with 
written approval.  
Section 6.3 – Measures to 
Minimize Bias: 
Randomization and 
Blinding  In the second paragraph, the 
mention of 13 doses of IP was 
removed.  Doses of IP will be 
greater than 13 for 
participants enrolled 
beyond 52 weeks.

statement was added to 
indicate the safety 
assessments  (vital signs, 
safety laboratories)  that will 
be taken at  less frequent 
intervals in the second versus 
first year of the study.  The safety profile of 
mepolizumab in the IB  
justifies a less frequent 
assessment of safety 
measures after the first 
year of treatment . 
Section 9 – Statistical 
Cons iderations  The first paragraph was 
updated  to include 
‘annualized’ exacerbations ;

 1. PROTOCOL SUMMARY  
1.1. Synopsis  
Protocol Title:  A multi -center, randomized, double -blind, parallel group, placebo -
controlled study of mepolizumab 100 mg SC as add -on treatment in participants with 
COPD experiencing frequent exacerbations and characterized by [CONTACT_238472] (Study  
208657 ) 
Short Title:   Mepolizumab as Add-on Treatment IN participants with COPD 
characterized by [CONTACT_238475] (MATINEE)  
Rationale:   Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is characterized by 
[CONTACT_238476], in the airways and the lung, to noxious particles or gases. 
While the disease course is marked by [CONTACT_238477] (AECOPD) which contribute to the overall 
disease severity and which increase in frequency as the disease worsens [ Vogelmeier , 
2017; Barnes , 2015].  In addition to the increased risk of morbidity and mortality 
associated with COPD exacerbations, these events place a significant economic burden 
on healthcare systems which is predicted to increase with the increasing global disease 
prevalence [ Halpin , 2017; Perera , 2012; Toy, 2010].  
Mepolizumab has been studied in patients with COPD with limited or no treatment 
options [ Pavord , 2017].  The initial Phase IIIA COPD mepolizumab program consisted of 
two 52 -week multicenter, ra ndomized, double blind, placebo -controlled studies, 
MEA117106 and MEA117113 [ Pavord , 2017].  These studies compared treatment with 
mepolizumab to placebo when added to maximum inhaled standard of care  (Inhaled 
corticosteroids [ICS]  plus long-acting beta 2-adrenergic receptor agonists [LABA]  plus 
long-acting muscarinic receptor antagonists [LAMA]).  MEA117113 randomized 
participants with peripheral blood eosinophil counts of ≥150 cells/µL at Screening or  
≥300 cells/µL in the prior 12 months.  MEA117106 was stratified based on blood 
eosinophil levels at Screening and randomized participants who either met the same 
threshold as for MEA117113, designated the “high stratum”, or who had a blood 
eosinophil leve l <150 cells/µL at Screening and no evidence of blood eosinophil levels 
≥300 cells/µL in the year prior, designated the “low stratum”.  
Evidence from MEA117113 and MEA117106 demonstrated a consistent and clinically 
relevant impact of treatment with mepoliz umab 100 mg SC compared with placebo on 
exacerbation reduction in participants with COPD who frequently exacerbate despi[INVESTIGATOR_238405] -based inhaled triple maintenance therapy  (ICS plus LABA plus 
LAMA) . 
This study is designed to confirm the benefits of mepolizumab treatment on the primary 
outcome of moderate/severe exacerbations as well as to more robustly inform on 
outcomes which are less frequent such as exacerbations requiring emergency department 
(ED)/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_238406]. 
TMF-[ADDRESS_288806] been modified to focus on a 
group of COPD participants with a documented historical blood eosinophil count of ≥150 
cells/μL  in the 12 months prior to Screening  Visit 0  (or at Screening Visit 1)  and blood 
eosinophil counts of ≥300 cells/µL at Screening Visit 0 that are more likely to benefit 
from mepolizumab treatment .  
Objectives and Endpoints : 
Objective  Endpoint  
Primary  
• To evaluate the efficacy of mepolizumab 
100 mg subcutaneous (SC) compared to

responders (≥2 unit reduction in CAT score 
from Baseline) at Week 52  
• Proportion of St. George's Respi[INVESTIGATOR_6004]  (SGRQ) total score  
responders (measured using the  St. 
George's Respi[INVESTIGATOR_238408]  [SGRQ -C], and defined as ≥4 point 
reduction in SGRQ total score fr om 
Baseline) at Week 52 
• Proportion of Evaluating Respi[INVESTIGATOR_238409] (E -RS: COPD) 
responders  (≥2 unit reduction in total score 
from B aseline)  at Week 52  
• Annualized rate of exacerbations requiring 
ED visit and/or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_238410]-13811028  CONFIDENTIAL

 Overall Design:  
This is a multi -center, randomized, placebo -controlled, parallel group, double -blind, trial 
evaluating mepolizumab 100 mg SC compared with placebo given every 4 weeks as a 
liquid formulation in a pre -filled safety syringe injection . The study treatment period  will 
be a minimum of 52 weeks  up to a maximum of 104 week s. The study treatment duration 
for each participant will be determined based on a number of factors, which are detailed 
in the main body of the study protocol (Section 4.4). 
Study inclusion criteria require a blood eosinophil count of ≥300 cells/μL at Screening  
Visit 0  and a documented  historical blood eosinophil count of ≥150 cells/μL in the [ADDRESS_288807] been measured within 14 days of a  COPD exacerbation . 
Participants with no documented historical  blood  eosinophil count of ≥150 cells/µL must 
meet this threshold at the Screening Visit [ADDRESS_288808] a history 
of regular use of ICS -based triple maintenance COPD therapy (as  defined in  Inclusion 
Criteria , Section 5.1) for at least [ADDRESS_288809] a 
documented  history of use of a specific ICS -based inhaled triple maintenance COPD 
regimen (ICS plus LABA plus LAMA)  with a minimum inhaled corticosteroid at a dose 
of ≥500 mcg/day fluticasone propi[INVESTIGATOR_117476] .  Participants are also required to 
have a histor y of at least 2  moderate COPD exacerbations that were treated  with systemic 
corticosteroids (intramuscular (IM), intravenous or oral) with or without antibiotics, or [ADDRESS_288810] occurred while treated with ICS plus LABA 
plus LAMA.  All  participants will continue optimized maintenance COPD therapy 
throughout the entire duration of the study regardless of intervention arm assignment.  
Note:   The COVID -[ADDRESS_288811] of this clinical study  by, for 
example, preventing participants from attending study visits at the study site during 
periods when the transmission of the virus is being managed with local/national 
government  instruction to not leave home .  Where applicable country and local 
regulations and infrastructure allow, and at the discretion of the Investigator and consent 
of the participant, home healthcare may take place at a location other than the clinical 
study s ite, e.g ., the participant’s home to perform study assessments.  In addition, the 
public health measures brought in to combat COVID -19 such as mask wearing, social 
distancing and lockdowns can potentially lead to a fall in non -COVID viral infections 
(e.g., respi[INVESTIGATOR_4345], influenza) and pollution , which in turn reduce the 
overall COPD exacerbation rates of the study population.  
Disclosure Statement : 
This is a parallel group double -blind intervention study with 2 arms, one active 
mepolizumab and  one placebo matching arm  given to participants as an add on to their 
optimized maintenance COPD therapy.

 Number of Participants:  
It is estimated that  approximately  4000  participants will be screened to achieve 
approximately 800 randomized participants and  an estimated total of 400 randomized 
participants per intervention group.   The number of randomized participants may increase 
up to approximately  1400  (approximately 700 per intervention group)  following blinded 
sample size re -evaluation.  
Intervention  Groups and Duration:  
Following the Run-in period, eligible participants will be randomized 1:[ADDRESS_288812] (IP) will be administered  as a single SC 
injection given every [ADDRESS_288813] randomized participant 
will be scheduled to complete only 52 weeks of the study.  
 
The primary efficacy endpoint will include all moderate (require either systemic 
corticosteroids and/or antibiotics) and severe exacerbations (requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_238411]) reported after the first dose up to and including the last study visit 
(Exit Visit ). 
Pharmacokinetic Sub -study:  China  and US only 
An optional pharmacokinetic (PK) sub -study will be conducted in China  and t he US  to 
assess potential ethnic differences in the PK of mepolizumab [ADDRESS_288814] 52 weeks of the study period  only. 
Independent Adjudication  Committee:  
An independent external adjudication committee for all serious adverse event ( SAE ) 
reports will be utilized in this study to ensure external objective medical review of these 
events in a blinded fashion.  Additionally , Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE)  
(cardiovascular death, non -fatal myocardial infarction, non -fatal stroke)  will also be 
adjudicated in a blinded fashion by [CONTACT_238480].

 2. INTRODUCTION  
2.1. Study Rationale  
While chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD ) is generally viewed as a disease 
driven by [CONTACT_238482], up to 40% of COPD patients have an inflammatory 
pattern that includes elevated sputum eosinophils [ Brightling , 2005; Saha , 2006].  In 
severe COPD patients, sputum eosinophils and Interleukin (IL) -5 levels  are elevated to 
similar levels as those seen in severe asthmatics [ Bafadhel , 2012a].  Notably, COPD 
patients with eosinophilic inflammation cannot be  distinguished based on clinical features 
and lung function alone from those without eosinophilic inflammation [ Saha , 2006].  
Furthermore, increased eosinophilic  inflammation in COPD has been associated with 
increased risk of exacerbations [ Vedel -Krogh , 2016].  COPD exacerbations are 
characterized by [CONTACT_238483], deterioration in lung function, 
and decreased health -related quality of life (HRQoL) [Vogelmeier , 2017] and potentially 
contribute to further permanent decrements in lung function.  Recent studies identified 
that increased eosinophilic airway inflammation occurred during COPD exacerbations 
[Bafadhel , 2011] and that peripheral eosinophils levels in the blood were used 
successfully as a surrogate marker to predict response to corticosteroid therapy [ Bafadhel , 
2012b; Bafadhel , 2017].  A study by [CONTACT_238484] [ Siva, 2007] showed that a treatment 
strategy that aimed to reduce  sputum eosinophils in COPD showed a significant reduction 
in severe exacerbations compared to a treatment strategy aimed towards symptom 
reductions alone.  
Based on the observation that airway eosinophilic inflammation is associated with COPD 
exacerbations  [Bafadhel , 2011; Bafadhel , 2017], that a treatment regimen designed to 
reduce eosinophils will attenuate COPD exacerbations, and that airwa y levels of IL -[ADDRESS_288836] hma and in eosinophilic -
phenotype of COPD, the mepolizumab COPD program was designed to study a COPD 
patient population meeting a blood eosinophil threshold with a history of exacerbations 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_238412] (ICS) -based triple mainten ance therapy.  This 
clinical experience and the successful reduction of acute exacerbation of COPD 
(AECOPD) by [CONTACT_8668] -5 inhibition with mepolizumab [ Pavord , 201 7] suggests that the 
management of exacerbations can be tailored by [CONTACT_238485] a treatable trait.  
Mepolizumab is a humanised immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody (IgG1, kappa) which 
binds to and inhibits the ability of IL -[ADDRESS_288837] of 
mepolizumab, administered every 4 week s through subcutaneous (SC) injection, on the 
rate of moderate/severe COPD exacerbations in participants with a history of COPD 
exacerbations despi[INVESTIGATOR_238413] -based triple maintenance therapy [ Pavord , 2017].  
Studies MEA117106 and MEA117113 demonstrated that treatment with mepolizumab 
TMF-13811028  CONFIDENTIAL   
  208657  
 Protocol Amendment 6  
 35 
 led to improvements in exacerbations and other efficacy endpoints when compared with 
placebo.  In addition, in these studies, the safety profile of mepolizumab was similar to 
placebo and no new safety concerns were identified in this COPD patient population to 
those identified in the severe asthma program .  
The results from MEA117113 and MEA117106 demonstrate th at while patients selected 
with an exacerbating phenotype and with a blood eosinophil count 150 cells/ µL at 
Screening or 300 cells/ µL in previous 12 months achieved a clinically relevant 
reduction in moderate/severe exacerbations, patients with a blood eosinophil count 300 
cells/ µL (in previous 12 months or at S creening) are more likely to achieve greater 
benefit from mepolizumab.  Thus, a blood eosinophil c ount 300 cells/µL provides a 
clear threshold to identify patients that are more lik ely to benefit from mepolizumab . In 
this study , to ensure stability of eosinophil counts , an additional requirement is for  a 
documented historical eosinophil count of ≥150 cells/µL in the 12 months prior to 
Screening Visit 0 . Participants with no documented historical eosinophil count of ≥150 
cells/µL must meet this threshold at the Screening Visit 1 assessment prior to 
randomi zation . 
Therefore, this  study will provide additional efficacy data on the benefits of mepolizumab 
treatment in a more refined patient population expected to benefit from treatment.  In 
addition to exacerbation data, this study wil l provide additional important HRQoL  data 
for me polizumab compared with placebo.  
2.2. Background  
COPD is a chronic progressive disease with rising morbidity and mortality and is 
currently the fourth leading cause of death in the world [ WHO  Report , 2008]; Lozano , 
2012].  The disease course is marked by [CONTACT_238486] [ Vogelmeier , 2017].  
In addition, a study by [Hurst , 2010] showed that the single best predictor of 
exacerbations was previous exacerbations .  
AECOPD are heterogeneous in nature with respect to their inflammatory component.  A 
study by [CONTACT_238484] [Siva, 2007] showed that a treatment strategy that aimed to reduce 
sputum eosinophil counts in COPD showed a significant reduction in severe 
exacerbations compa red with a treatment strategy aimed towards optimizing symptoms 
alone.  Subsequent studies found that increased eosinophilic airway inflammation 
occurred during COPD exacerbations [ Bafadhel , 2011] and that blood eosinophil levels 
were used successfully as a surrogate for sputum eosinophil levels to predict response to 
corticosteroid therapy [ Bafadhel , 2017].  Furthermore, the 2019 GOLD report 
recommends the use of blood eosinophil count as a biomarker for considering treatment 
of COPD with inhaled corticosteroids  [GOLD , 2019 ]. Additionally, the results from the 
mepolizumab COPD initial phase IIIA studies indicate that blood eosinophil levels are a 
useful biomarker to tailor treatment and prevent exacerbations for those COPD patients 
with an eosinophilic phenotype defined by [CONTACT_238487] [ Pavord , 
2017].  
TMF-13811028  CONFIDENTIAL   
  208657  
 Protocol Amendment 6  
 36 
 The [GOLD , 2019 ] report advocate s the use of one or more long -acting  inhaled 
bronchodilators  (long acting beta2 -agonist [LABA]) or (long acting muscarinic 
antagonist [ LAMA ]) in addition to ICS for patients with more advanced disease , high 
blood eosinophil count and high risk of exacerbations [ GOLD , 2019]   
The concurrent use of these medications (i.e., ICS  plus LABA  plus LAMA) is often 
termed ‘triple inhaled maintenance therapy’ and is usually considered optimal for COPD 
patients at risk of exacerbations.  For patients who continue to exacerbate despi[INVESTIGATOR_238414] (approximately 40% of patients on inhaled triple therapy), there 
are limited additional maintenance treatment options.  Of these patients, approximately 
20% have eosinophil levels ≥ 300 cells/μL [ Müllerova , 2017].  
 
Overall, there are approximately 6.1%  of COPD patients who have progressive disease 
that is not controlled with triple therapy , and blood eosinophil levels ≥300 cells/µL , who 
could benefit from the attenuation of eosinophilic inflammation by [CONTACT_238488] 
[Benson , 2018 ]. 
 
This population of patients is at higher risk of poor outcomes including a 2 -fold increased 
risk of moderate/severe exacerbations and a 26% increase in mortality compared with the 
general COPD population [GlaxoSmithKline document number 2017N350371_00 ]. 
 
The mepolizumab COPD program addresses a key unmet need in patients at high risk for 
adverse outcomes.  The patient populat ion for mepolizumab includes patients who 
continue to experience AECOPD despi[INVESTIGATOR_238415] -based 
triple inhaled maintenance therapy (see inclusion criteria Section  5.1).  There are limited 
or no additional therapeutic options [ GOLD , 2019 ] for this target population with a high 
burden of disease despi[INVESTIGATOR_238416].  
2.3. Benefit/Risk Assessment  
More detailed information about the known and expected benefits and risks and

 Mitigation Strategy  
In the event of an acute severe reaction 
(e.g., anaphylaxis) following administration 
of study treatment, there must be 
personnel/staff onsite at the treat ment 
facility who are appropriately trained in 
basic life support to manage the patient 
including administration of medications 
(e.g., epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]), and have access to a 
system that can promptly transport the 
patient to another facility for additional 
care if appropriate.  
Local Injection site reactions  In the integrated Phase IIIA COPD trials

 Potential Risk of Clinical Significance  Data/Rationale for Risk  
 Mitigation Strategy  
Potential risk of immunogenicity  Mepolizumab has low immunogenic 
potential. Overall, the immunogenicity 
results from clinical studies across the 
mepolizumab program demonstrate that the 
presence of anti -drug antibodies (ADAs) is 
not associated with any specific adverse 
events, anti -mepolizumab antibodies did 
not discernibly impact the 
pharmacokinetics (PK) or 
pharmacodynamics (PD) of mepolizumab 
in the majority of participants and there 
was no evidence of a correlation between 
antibody titers and change in eosinophil 
level.  
Immunogenicity data reported to date 
across the mepolizumab development 
program are summarized in the IB; See 
Section 5.4 ‘Cli nical Immunogenicity’ and 
in Section 6 ‘ Summa ry of D ata and 
guidance for the investigator ”. Blood samples will be collected for 
detection of both ADA and neutralizing 
antibodies (Nab). 
Potential risk for adverse cardiovascular 
(CV) effects  In the integrated Phase IIIA COPD trials 
117106 and 117113, incidence of

 2.3.2.  Benefit Assessment  
Study 208657 will investigate the efficacy and safety of mepolizumab in the reduction of 
moderate/severe COPD exacerbations in participants receiving intensive therapeutic 
intervention f or COPD treatment recommended for this population with severe disease 
and high risk of AECOPD.  
Exacerbations are a major concern to COPD patients and lead to a worsening of the 
quality of life for patients. A reduction in frequency of moderate and severe 
exacerbations may improve a patient’s quality of life and may reduce hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602].  
Participants in this study will be followed -up monthly and will continue optimized 
maintenance COPD therapy and therefore may benefit both from the additional assurance 
of medicine compliance and monitoring of their current maintenance therapy. 
Participants may also benefit from regular monitoring of their COPD symptoms and 
potential identification of exacerbations.  
Data obtained from this study will provide additional ev aluation of the efficacy and 
safety of mepolizumab delivered as a pre-filled liquid formulation in a safety syringe.  
2.3.3.  Overall Benefit:  Risk Conclusion  
Data from mepolizumab preclinical and clinical development demonstrate the ability of 
mepolizumab to inhibit IL -5, and consequently treat inflammatory conditions linked to an 
eosinophil signal, such as COPD patients predisposed to future exacerbations. To date, 
the safety profile of mepolizumab has been favourable. Furthermore, preclinical and 
clinical data to date have not identified any safety concerns that would preclude further 
investigation in COPD. Importantly, in addition to their randomized IP, all participants 
will be receiving optimized maintenance COPD therapy throughout the study.  Therefore, 
further investigation of the efficacy and safety of mepolizumab is justified in study 
208657.

participants in the US and Chinese 
participants in China  • Plasma mepoliz umab concentrations  
 
4. STUDY DESIGN  
4.1. Overall Design  
Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed with the exception of immediate safety 
concerns.  Therefore, adherence to the study design requirements, including those 
specified in the Schedule of Activities (SoA, Section  1.3), are essential and required for 
study conduct.  
This is a multi -center, randomized, placebo -controlled, double -blind, parallel group, trial 
evaluating mepolizumab 100 mg compared with placeb o given every 4 weeks through SC 
injection of a liquid formulation delivered in a pre -filled safety syringe.  
It is estimated that approximately  4000 participants will be screened to achieve a target 
global randomization of approximately  800 randomized par ticipants.  The number of 
randomized participants may increase up to approximately  1400 following blinded 
sample size re -evaluation (Section 9.2).  Eligible participants will be randomized 1:[ADDRESS_288839] review  the results of the Visit 0 blood eosinophil count  
prior to initiating Screening Visit 1.  Participants with eosinophil count  less than 300 
cells/L cannot proceed to Screening V isit [ADDRESS_288840] a documented historical eosinophil count of ≥150/μL in the 
[ADDRESS_288841] 
been measured during a COPD exacerbation.   Participants with no documented historical 
eosinoph il count of ≥150 cells/µL must meet this threshold based on the Screening Visit 
1 assessment in order to return for Visit 2  (Inclusion Criteria, Section 5.1). 
Investigators are required  to thoroughly review participants ’ medical records to identify 
historical eosinophil counts.   It is only in the absence of documented records will 
eosinophils meas urement at Screening Visit1 be considered.  
Participants who meet all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria at 
Screening Visit [ADDRESS_288842]

 52 weeks  (see SoA in Section 1.3.1 ) and up to  a maximum of  104 weeks  (See SoA in 
Section 1.3.2 ). More specifically,  
• For participants  enrolled for 52 weeks  (SoA in Section 1.3.1 ), their Exit Visit will 
occur  at Week [ADDRESS_288843] scheduled dose of IP . 
 
• For participants enrolled  beyond 52 weeks  (SoA in Section 1.3.2 ), their Exit Visit 
will be  at Week 104 or  until a scheduled visit that aligns  to the date (i.e., that 
occurs on or before)  the last randomized participant is scheduled to complete their 
Week [ADDRESS_288844] of care treatment (as 
further defined in inclusion criteria  Section 5.1) for at least [ADDRESS_288845] a recorded history of use of an ICS-based inhaled triple regimen 
(ICS plus LABA plus LAMA)  with a minimum inhaled corticosteroid at a dose of 
≥500  mcg/day fluticasone propi[INVESTIGATOR_117476] .  A detailed schematic is provided in 
the study reference manual ( SRM ) giving examples of ICS plus LABA plus LAMA 
therapy in the [ADDRESS_288846] 2 moderate COPD 
exacerbations that were treated  with systemic corticosteroids  (intramuscular (IM),  
intravenous, or oral)  with or without antibiotics,  or [ADDRESS_288847] occur red while the participant was receiving ICS plus LABA plus LAMA  (Inclusio n 
Criteria , Section 5.1).  All participants will receive optimized maintenance COPD therapy 
throughout the entire duration of the study regardless of treatment arm assignment.   In 
addition to ICS plus LABA plus LAMA,  participants can enter the study with other 
COPD maintenance medications.  
The requirement for ICS plus LABA plus LAMA is predicated on the participant’s 
tolerance and safety to ICS and to long -acting inhaled bronchodilators.  However, it is 
recognized tha t maximal tolerated and safe therapy may not allow the use of a LAMA or 
LABA in combination with ICS in a given participant.  Where documentation of safety 
and tolerance does not allow the use of LABA or LAMA, participants will be allowed 
into the study on  ICS plus LABA or ICS plus LAMA.  These circumstances must be 
reviewed and discussed with the Medical Monitor.  
It is also rec ognized that escalation or de -escalation of COPD maintenance medications 
may need to be individualized if clinically crucial for a participant .  The investigator will 
TMF-13811028  CONFIDENTIAL   
  208657  
 Protocol Amendment 6  
 48 
 discuss all cases with the Medical Monitor before initiating changes to a participant’s 
COPD maintenance medication regimen.  
The study intervention al product, prepared in a pre -filled safety syringe, will be 
administered  as a single SC injection given every 4 weeks at every study visit  (except for 
the Exit Visit), beginning at the  Randomization  Visit  (Visit 2) .  The Exit Visit  will occur 
[ADDRESS_288848] dose up to and including the 
Exit Visit.  
Participants should  understand and agree to complete an e lectronic diary (eDiary) 
throughout the study to be considered eligible.  The daily eDiary consists of questions to 
be answered each evening before bedtime.  The same eDiary will be used to capture 
patient reported outcomes  (PROs)  (see Section 8.1.3 ).  Site staff must therefore train 
participants on the proper use of the eDiary and completion of PROs at Visit 1. 
Compliance with completion of the daily eDiary will be captured during the Run -in 
period and throughout the study.  Participant s must meet the eDiary compliance 
requirement for them to be eligible for randomization.   
Instream review of the eDiary  data will monitor pa rticipant  symptoms sug gestive of an 
exacerbation and will also trigger prompts to encourage site staff to contact [CONTACT_238493].  
Supplementary study conduct information not mandated to be present in this protocol is 
provided in the  accompanying SRM. The SRM will provide the site staff with 
administrative and detailed technical information that does not impact participant safety.  
Note:   The COVID -[ADDRESS_288849] at a location 
other than the clinical study site, e.g ., the participant’s home to perform study 
assessments.  Refer to Appendix 10  and the SRM for details on COVID -19 pandemic 
measures and home healthcare for s tudy assessments.  
Pharmacokinetic Sub -study:  China a nd US only  
An optional pharmacokinetic (PK) sub -study will be included in China and the US to 
assess potential ethnic differences in the PK of mepolizumab [ADDRESS_288850] of care (SoC) therapy 
must include a well-documented  requirement for ICS -based triple COPD maintenance 
treatment (per inclusion criteria Section 5.1) for at least [ADDRESS_288851] 2 moderate COPD 
exacerbations that were treated with systemic  corticosteroid  (intramuscular (IM), 
intravenous, or oral)  with or without antibiotics,  or 1 severe exacerbation  requiring 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_238419] 12 months prior to Screening Visit 1.  
All participants will receive optimized maintenance COPD therapy throug hout the entire 
duration of the study regardless of intervention arm assignment.   
The 2 -week Run -in period allows for the assessment of participant understanding and 
compliance with the daily eDiary to establish Baseline E -RS: COPD symptoms, and to 
allow adequate time for receipt of results from assessments collected at Screening Visit 1.  
A Screening blood eosinophil count threshold of ≥300 cells/μL at Screening Visit [ADDRESS_288852] shown that patients 
with an eosinophil count ≥300 cells/μL are likely to achieve greater benefit from 
mepolizumab  treatment . 
For participants with no documented historical eosinophil count  of ≥150 cells/µL  in the 
[ADDRESS_288853] data over the full study period, whether participants 
continue on IP or in the case o f premature discontinuation from IP.  However, the 
decision to continue in the study after premature discontinuation from IP remains the 
prerogative of the participant.  Participants who agree to continue in the study after 
premature discontinuation from I P (for any reason) will continue to be contact[CONTACT_238494], either through in clinic visits or by [CONTACT_233351], on a 
monthly basis (aligned to their study schedule) until the end of their planned 
participation , to enable cap ture of post -intervention information.  
4.3. Justification of Dose  
Evide nce from the two initial phase IIIA studies demonstrated that in individuals with 
blood eosinophils ≥150 cells/µL at screening or ≥300 cells/µL in the prior year, a 100 mg 
SC dose provided a  clinically relevant reduction in the primary endpoint of 
moderate/severe exacerbations of 18 to 20% compared with placebo.  This magnitude of 
reduction was consistent across studies (MEA117113 and MEA117106 High Stratum) 
and across the two doses investiga ted with an 18 -20% reduction with 100 mg and 14% 
reduction with 300 mg [ Pavord , 2017].  The absence of evidence of a greater reduction in 
the rate of moderate/severe exacerbations and prolonged time to first moderate/severe 
exacerbation with 300 mg SC, as well as the absence of evidence of an exposure -
response for those endpoints, support the rationale for a 100 mg SC therapeutic dose 
administered every  4 weeks in pati ents with COPD [ Pavord , 2017].

 • Placebo SC  
A unique Participant Number will be assig ned to participants who have consented. This 
unique participant number will be used to identify the individual participant throughout 
the study and will not be re -assigned to any other participant.  
Participants will be assigned to study intervention in accordance with the randomization 
schedule. Once a Randomization number has been assigned to a participant, it cannot be 
reassigned to any other participant in the study.  
The Randomization schedule will be generated using a validated Randomization 
software .  Separate Randomization schedules will be created for each country. Equal 
numbers of participants will be allocated to each intervention arm.  
Details of how to use the IWRS  to register and randomize participants will be provided in 
the SRM.  
The IWRS  will be programmed with blind -breaking instructions. In case of an 
emergency, the investigator has the sole responsibility for determining if unblinding of a 
participants’s interve ntion assignment is warranted.  Participant safety must always be the 
first cons ideration in making such a deter mination.  If the investigator decides that 
unblinding is warranted, the investigator should make every effort to contact [CONTACT_238498] a participant’s intervention assignment unless this could delay emergency 
intervention of the participant.   If a participant’s intervention assignment is unblinded 
[COMPANY_004] must be notified within [ADDRESS_288871] discontinue IP but may continue in the study if the participant’s 
intervention assignment is unblinded by [CONTACT_31598].  The event 
or condition which led to the unblinding will be recorded i n the eCRF.  
[COMPANY_004]’s Global Clinical Safety and Pharmacovigilance (GCSP) staff may unblind the 
intervention  assignment for any participant w ith an SAE. If the SAE requires that an 
expedited regulatory report be sent to one or more regulatory agencies, a copy of the 
report, identifying the participant’s  intervention  assignment, may be sent to investigators 
in accordance with local regulations and/or [COMPANY_004] policy.  
6.4. Study Intervention  Compliance  
Study intervention will be administered at the study site by a designat ed member of the 
site staff. Drug dispensing/accountability logs will be maintained by a designated 
member of the site staff.  
 
• Participants are dosed under medical supervision at the site, they will receive 
mepolizumab 100 mg SC or matching placebo, provid ed in a pre -filled safety 
syringe, directly from the Investigator or designee.  The date and time of each dose 
administered in the clinic will be recorded in the participant’s source documents.

person administering the study intervention.  
• For the first three administrations p articipants will be monitored for [ADDRESS_288872] , participants will be monitored  according to the monitoring 
policies for the center  or vendor for home visits .   
• In the event of an acute severe reaction (e. g., anaphylaxis) f ollowing administration 
of study treatment, there must be personnel/staff onsite at the treatment facility or at 
the participant’s home (if a home visit)  who are appropriately trained in basic life 
support to manage the patient including administration of medications  (e.g., 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]), and have access to a system that can promptly transport the patient to 
another facility for additional care if appropriate.  
• Administration of study intervention will be documented in the source documents 
and reported in the  CRF.

PARTICIPANT DISCONTI NUATION/WITHDRAWAL  
7.1. Discontinuation of Study Intervention  
In rare instances, it may be necessary for a participant to permanently discontinue study 
intervention. If a participant permanently discontinues interventi onal product before the 
end of the protocol specified randomized intervention period, every effort will be made 
by [CONTACT_238501].  Participants will be provid ed with the option to continue to have 
regularly scheduled in -clinic visits or to have regularly scheduled phone visits.  The 
Investigator must document the reason for discontinuation of IP in the eCRF.  The 
principal Investigator/ site staff should contin ue contact [CONTACT_238502].  The required 
study assessments will depend on whether the participant is attending an in -clinic visit or 
a scheduled phone visit.  At a minimum,  an assessment of exacerbations, AEs, SAEs, and 
concomitant medications will be completed.  Further details are provided in the SRM.  
TMF-[ADDRESS_288875] the participant return to the clinic 4 
weeks after the participant perman ently discontinues IP in order to complete the 
Discontinuation from IP Visit.   
The primary reason for discontinuation from IP will be recorded in the eCRF.  
Participants should permanently discontinue IP, but not the study, if the following criteria 
are met: 
• Meets any of the protocol -defined liver chemistry stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3418], identified 
during the study or identified during routine standard of care assessments outside 
of the study (See Section  7.1.1  and Appendix 7)  
• ECG: Clinically significant abnormality identified during the study that meet the 
QTc stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_131956]  7.1.2  
• Pregnancy:  Positive pregnancy test ( See Appendix  5) 
7.1.1.  Liver Chemistry Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_238429].  
Discontinuation of study intervention  for abnormal liver tests  is required when:  
• a participant meets one of the conditions outlined in the algorithm  below   
• when in the presence of abnormal liver chemistries not meeting protocol -specified 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004], the investigator believes study intervention  discontinuation  is in 
the best interest of the participant.

• The QT correction  Frideri cia formula must  be used for each individual participant  to 
determine eligibility for and discontinuation from IP.  This formula may not be 
changed or substituted once the participant  has been enrolled.    
A participant who meets either bulleted criteria based on the average of triplicate ECG 
readings will be withdrawn from study treatment intervention but not from the study:  
• QTcF > 500 msec OR Uncorrected  QT > 600 msec  
• Change from baseline of QTcF  >60 msec

7.1.3.  Temporary Discontinuation  
If a participant becomes infected (parasitic infection) whilst receiving study intervention 
and does not respond to anti -helminth treatment, temporary discontinuation of study 
intervention should be considered in consultation with [COMPANY_004] Medical Monitor.  
7.2. Participant Discontinuation /Withdrawal  from the S tudy  
A participant may prematurely discontinue study intervention product and withdraw from 
the study at any time at his/her own request, or at any time at the discretion of the 
investigator for safety, behavioural,  compliance or administrative reasons.  
Participants may withdraw from the PK sub -study and remain in the study.  
Participants who permanently discontinue IP are not required to withdraw from the study.  
If a participant must permanently discontinue IP, every effort should be made by [CONTACT_12226]/site staff to keep the participant in the study to collect important efficacy and 
safety data.  Participants who have permanently discontinued IP and have not withdrawn 
consent may continue in the study to complete all remaining protocol specified visi ts by 
[CONTACT_238504] -clinic visits  (or home healthcare , if applicable)  or by [CONTACT_89205].  
For p articipants who discontinue IP but remain in the study, an IP discontinuation Visit 
should be conducted as shown in SoA.  See SoA (Section 1.3) for data to be collected at 
the time of IP discontinuation .  If for any reason those participants later withdraw from 
the study, a withdrawal from the study Visit should be conducted as shown in the SoA. 
Additional details will be given in the SRM.  
For p articipant s who discontinue IP and withdraw from the study at the same time, the 
Withdrawal from study Visit should be conducted as per S oA.  
If the participant withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the sponsor may 
retain and continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent.  
If a participant withdraws from the study, he/she may request destruction of any sam ples 
taken and not tested, and the investigator must document this in the site study records.  
Any participant who withdraws from the study prior to their planned Completion of 
Study date (defined in Section 4.4) will be considered to have missing data from the date 
of study withdrawal up to their planned Completion of Study date.  
TMF-[ADDRESS_288876] be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a 
required study visit:  
• The site must attempt to conta ct the participant and reschedule the missed visit 
as soon as possible and counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining 
the assigned visit schedule and ascertain whether or not the participant wishes to 
and/or should continue in the study.  
• Befo re a participant is deemed lost to follow up, the investigator or designee 
must make every effort to regain contact [CONTACT_6635] (where possible, 3 
telephone calls and, if necessary, a certified letter to the participant’s last known 
mailing addres s or local equivalent methods). These contact [CONTACT_19425]’s medical record.  
• Should the participant continue to be unreachable, he/she will be considered to 
have withdrawn from the study.  
Discontinuation of specific sit es or of the study as a whole are handled as part of 
Appendix 1 . 
7.4. Reasons for IP Discontinuation and/or Study Withdrawal  
The primary reason for  IP discontinuation and/or  study withdrawal will be recorded in 
the eCRF.  When a participant withdraws consent, the Investigator must document the 
reason (if specified by [CONTACT_2299]) in the eCRF.

8.1. Efficacy Assessments  
8.1.1.  Moderate and Severe COPD Exacerbations  
Moderate exacerbations are defined per protocol as clinically significant exacerbations 
that require treatment with oral/systemic corticosteroids and/or antibiotics.  
Severe exacerbations are defined per protocol as clinically significant exacerbations that 
require in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (i.e., ≥24 hr s) or result in death.  
The decision to treat moderate exacerbations should be cor roborated by [CONTACT_238505].  
For safety reasons alerts will be programmed into the eDiary to encourage the participant 
to contact [CONTACT_238506]. The site will also receive 
notification of the alert. An alert itself will not be classified as a moderate exacerbation 
unless it resulted in subsequent treatment for the worsening of symptoms meeting the 
definition above.

 [IP_ADDRESS].  Guidelines for Identifying Symptom Defined COPD Exacerbations  
The following are symptoms used to ascertain an exacerbation of COPD:   
Worsening of two or more of the following major symptoms for at least two consecutive 
days:  
Dyspnea  
Sputum volume  
Sputum pur ulence (color)  
OR 
Worsening of any one major symptom together with any one of the following minor 
symptoms for at least two consecutive days:  
Sore throat  
Colds (nasal discharge and/or nasal congestion)  
Fever (oral temperature >37.5°C) without other cause  
Increased cough  
Increased wheeze  
Site staff will have access to a symptom summary report through a web -based portal. The 
symptoms summary report will indicate when symptoms meet the above criteria.  
If a participant is determined to have an exacerbation it should be treated per protocol as 
described in Section  8.1.2   
8.1.2.  Exacerbation Treatment  
If in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689]/treating physician,  the exacerbation is severe enough 
to warrant the need for oral corticosteroids (with or without antibiotics) the following 
guidelines should be used.  
• The duration of treatment with oral corticostero ids should be ≤14 days (dose and type 
according to local practice)  
• The duration of treatment with oral corticosteroids should not exceed 14 days unless 
given approval by [CONTACT_1689]  
• Any course of oral corticosteroids started within 7 days of finis hing a previous course 
will be considered as treatment for a single exacerbation  
If, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689]/treating physician, there is evidence of respi[INVESTIGATOR_238433]:  
• The duration of treatment with antibiotics should be 7 to 14 days (dose and type 
according to local practice).  If first line antibiotic treatment fails and additional

 76 
 antibiotics are used, the total duration of antibiotic treatment should not exceed 30 
days unless given approval by [CONTACT_1689].  
• Any course of antibiotics started within 7 days of finishing a previous course will be 
considered as treatment for the original exacerbation (i.e. a single exacerbation).  
Note:  Use of antibiotics for the treatment of upper or lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_238434] a COPD exacerbation unless worsening of COPD symptoms are 
documented by [CONTACT_238507]’s medical notes.  
All medications used for the treatment of exacerbations must be recorded in the source 
documents and the exacerbation page of the eCRF.  
Exacerbations should not be recorded in the AE section of the eCRF unless they meet the 
definition of an SAE . 
8.1.3.  Health Related Quality of Life Assessm ents 
All Clinical Outcomes Assessment  (COA ) efficacy endpoint assessments completed at 
study visits will be completed using the eDiary.  Participants will complete the following

[IP_ADDRESS].  COPD Assessment Test (CAT)  
The CAT [ Jones , 2009; Jones , 2012] is a short and simple patient completed 
questionnaire which has been developed for use in routine clinical practice to measure the 
health status of patients with COPD.  The CAT is an 8 -item questionnaire suitable for 
completion by [CONTACT_238508]. When completing the questionnaire, 
participants rate their experience on a 6 -point scale, ranging from 0 (no impairment) to 5 
(maximum impairment) with a scoring range of [ADDRESS_288882].  
The CAT should be completed in the clinic at each scheduled in clinic visit, before any 
other visit procedures, as indicated in the SoA (Section  1.3)  
[IP_ADDRESS].  St. George ’s Respi[INVESTIGATOR_238436]  (SGRQ -C) 
The SGRQ -C is a 40 -item patient questionnaire, designed to measure health impairment 
by [CONTACT_238509][INVESTIGATOR_1856] (questions 1 -7) and the patient ’s 
current state (questions 8 -14).  Higher scores indicate greater impairment of health. The 
SGRQ -C is derived from the original SGRQ, and produces scores equivalent to the 
SGRQ instrument [ Meguro , 2007].  The SGRQ -C is designed for supervised self -
administration which means that the participant should answer the questionnaire by 
[CONTACT_1029],  but that site staff can provide support if required. It is appropriate to help 
TMF-[ADDRESS_288883] difficulty reading 
questions may be read out loud.  The participant’s response should not be challenged.  
Participants must complete the questionnaire while in the clinic for their scheduled study 
visit. The SGRQ -C should be administered after CAT and before any other study 
procedures  at Randomization (Visit 2) and at additional visits indicated in the Schedule 
of Assessment (Section 1.3).  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Daily Symptom Diary  
Using the  eDiary , participants will complete a  daily symptom  diary  (each evening ) 
consisting of : 
• items from  EXACT ; 
• additional symptoms questions  (related to symptoms of an exacerbation) ; 
• rescue medication use ; and 
• night  time awakenings  
Participants will be trained to use the eDiary at Visit 1 and will complete the eDiary 
throughout the study.  
EXAcerbations of Chronic Pulmonary Disease Tool – Patient Reported Outcomes 
(EXACT) and Evaluating Respir atory Symptoms in COPD (E -RS: COPD)  
The Exacerbation of Chronic Pulmonary Disease Tool -Patient Reported Outcomes 
(EXACT) is a [ADDRESS_288884] captures information on 
the severity of the respi[INVESTIGATOR_238437] a COPD exacerbation as 
reported by [CONTACT_2299] [ Leidy , 2011].  
The EXACT questions will be the first questions presented for completion each evening 
at bedtime in the eDiary.   
The daily recording of information allows an asses sment of the underlying day to day 
variability of a participant’s symptoms and facilitates the detection of symptom 
worsening that may be indicative of a COPD exacerbation.  The total score for EXACT 
ranges from 0 -100, higher scores indicate more severe sy mptoms.  The entire instrument 
is intended to be completed in about 3 minutes or less (typi[INVESTIGATOR_238438]).  
The Evaluating Respi[INVESTIGATOR_238439] (E-RS: COPD) consists of [ADDRESS_288885] instrument. E -RS: COPD is intended to capture information 
related to the respi[INVESTIGATOR_238440], i.e. breathlessness, cough, sputum 
production, chest congestion, and chest tightness.  The E -RS: COPD has a scoring range 
of 0-40, higher scores indicate more severe symptoms [ Leidy , 2014].  
Three subscales of the E -RS: COPD are used to describe different symptoms; 
breathlessness, cough and sputum, and chest symptoms [E-RS™: COPD , 2016 ]. 
TMF-[ADDRESS_288886], participants will also complete 5 additional daily 
diary questions to provide the information on other symptoms suggestive of an 
exacerbation:  sputum purulence (color), wheezing, sore throat, colds (nasal discharge 
and/or nasal congestion) and fever witho ut other cause.  
These additional symptoms questions, combined with EXACT responses to questions on 
dyspnea , cough and sputum quantity will be used to trigger prompts to both site staff and 
patients about symptom changes , as described in S ection [IP_ADDRESS] , that may be indicative 
of an exacerbation.  
Rescue medication use  
The number of occasions of rescue medication use will also be captured in the daily 
eDiary . 
Night  time awakenings  
Data regarding nighttime awakenings will also be captured in the daily eDiary.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Patient Global Rating of COPD Severity and Patient Global Rating of 
Change in COPD  
Participants will complete the Global Rating of COPD Severity as per SoA (Section  1.3).  
This single global question will ask participants to rate their severity of COPD on a four 
point scale (mild, moderate, severe, very severe).   
Participants will complete a Global Rating of Change in COPD (overall disease) question 
at specified schedule d visits as per SoA, subsequent to randomization including the  Exit 
Visit (or IP Discontinuation Visit).  Response options are on a 7 point Likert scale 
ranging from much better to much worse.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Patient and Clinician Rated Response to Therapy  
The clinician will be asked to rate the response to therapy at the visits  
specified in SoA ( Section  1.3). This is an overall evaluation of response to intervention, 
conducted separately by [CONTACT_12214] a rating scale.  A seven -point scale score 
is used with the following definitions: 1 = significantly improved; 2 = moderately 
improved; 3 = mildly improved; 4 = no change; 5 = mildly worse; 6 = moderately worse;

 laboratory assessments are taken at less frequent intervals  in the second year ( Week 52 to 
104; Section 1.3.2 ) than in the first year (Week 0 to 52; Section 1.3.1 ). 
8.2.1.  Physical Examinations  
Complete  physical examinations will be performed at scheduled visits as noted in the 
SoA (Section  1.3). 
• A complete physical examination will include, at a minimum, assessments of the 
Skin, Cardiovascular, Respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], Gastrointestinal and Neurological systems.  
Height and weight will also be measured and recorded at Screening Visit 1.  For 
subsequent visits , only weight will be measured.  
• Investigators should pay special attention to historical clinical signs related to 
previous serious illnesses.  
8.2.2.  Vital Signs  
• Oral or skin temperature, pulse ra te and BP will be assessed.  
• Blood pressure and pulse measurements will be assessed in the resting state with a 
completely automated device. (Manual techniques will be used only if an 
automated device is not available).  
• Blood pressure and pulse measurement s should be preceded by [CONTACT_2669] [ADDRESS_288890] for the participant in a quiet setting without distractions (e.g., television, 
cell phones)  and should be taken before blood collection for laboratory tests . 
8.2.3.  Electrocardiograms  
• A single 12 -lead ECG and rhythm strip will be obtained at scheduled visits as 
outlined in the SoA (s ee Section  1.3) using an ECG machine that automa tically 
calculates the heart rate and measures PR, QRS, QT, and QTcF intervals  (if a 
machine read  QTcF  is unavailable, QTcF  will be manually calculated) .  All sites 
will use their own ECG equipment.  All results will be recorded after 
measurement of vital signs and prior to spi[INVESTIGATOR_038].  
• If a routine single ECG demonstrates a prolonged QT interval, obtain two more 
ECG readings over a brief recording period  (e.g., 5-10 minutes) , with each 
recording separated by [CONTACT_2669]  [ADDRESS_288891] (but not from the study). Refer to Section  
7.1.2  for QTc withdrawal criteria and additional QTc readings that may be 
necessary.  These ECG s in question should be scanned and sent to the Medical 
Monitor.

to treat them over each day in the medical problems and health care utilization worksheet. 
These entries will be reviewed by [CONTACT_238510].  
8.2.5.  Pneumonia  
All pneumonias should be confirmed by [CONTACT_238511] X -ray and 
captured on the AE/SAE page of the eCRF.  
Investigators and site staff should remain vigil ant for the possible development and 
diagnosis of pneumonia as the clinical features of such infections overlap with the 
symptoms of COPD exacerbations.  For all suspected cases of pneumonia, Investigators 
should confirm the diagnosis by [CONTACT_19201] a chest X-ray or documentation of the result of 
a chest X -ray performed outside of the clinic site.  Appropriate therapy should be 
initiated for confirmed pneumonia.  Confirmation by [CONTACT_13190] X -ray should occur within [ADDRESS_288893] be performed by [CONTACT_238512].  
• The Investigator must review the laboratory report , document this review, and record 
any clinically relevant changes occurring during the study in the AE section of the 
eCRF.  The laboratory reports must b e filed with the source documents. Clinically 
significant abnormal laboratory findings are those which are not associated with the 
underlying disease, unless judged by [CONTACT_238513] ’s condition.  
• All la boratory tests with values considered clinically significantly abnormal during 
participation in the study or within [ADDRESS_288894] dose of treatment should be 
repeated until the values return to normal or B aseline or are no longer considered 
signif icantly abnormal by [CONTACT_47998].  
• If such values do not return to normal/B aseline within a period of time judged 
reasonable by [CONTACT_737], the etiology should be identified and the Medical 
Monitor notified.  
• All protocol -requir ed laboratory assessments, as defined in Appendix 3, must be 
conducted in accordance with the laboratory manual and the SoA.

 • If additional non -protocol specified laboratory assessments are performed at the 
institution’s local laboratory and result in a change in patient management or are 
considered clinically significant by [CONTACT_737] (e.g., SAE or AE) the results 
must be recorded in the participant’s eCRF.   Refer to the SRM for appropriate 
processing and handling of samples to avoid duplicate and/or additional blood draws.   
A blood sample for hematology will be collected at scheduled study visits, including 
premature disc ontinuation of IP.  After Randomization, neither the site staff nor [COMPANY_004] 
personnel will be sent results from the central laboratory for: absolute and differential 
values for eosinophils, lymphocytes, basophils, neutrophils and monocytes. However, 
sites will  be sent total white blood counts throughout the study.   This must also be 
applied to hematology results received from a local laboratory.  
Routine non -fasting clinical chemistry including serum glucose and serum potassium 
levels will be performed as per So A.  In the event of premature discontinuation from IP 
or from the study a sample should be collected at the IP Discontinuation/study 
Withdrawal Visit  as specified in the SoA (Section  1.3).  
8.3. Adverse Events  and Serious Adverse Events  
The definitions of an AE or SAE can be found in Appendix 4. 
COPD exacerbations should not be recorded in the AE section of the eCRF unless they 
meet the definition of an SAE.  
The investigator and any qualified designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, 
and reporting events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible for 
following up AE s that are serious, considered related to the study intervention  or the 
study, or that caused the participant to discontinue the study intervention   (see Section 
7.1). 
The following AEs of special interest will have customized AE and SAE pages in the 
eCRF:  
• Systemic reactions  
• Local injection site reactions  
In addition, the information as to whether an event met the diagnostic criteria for 
anaphylaxis as outlined by [CONTACT_238514] [ Sampson , 2006] and

Visit/ Study  withdrawal visit at the time points specified in the SoA (Section 1.3). 
Medical occurrences that begin before the start of intervention product  but after 
obtaining informed consent will be recorded on the Medical History/Current Medical 
Conditions section of th e CRF  not the AE section.  
• All SAEs will be recorded and reported to the sponsor or designee immediately and 
under no circumstance should this exceed 24 hrs,  as indicated in  Appendix 4. The 
Investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the sponsor within 24 hours of it 
being available.  
• Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs after the conclusion of 
the study participation. However, if the Investigator learns of any SAE, including a 
death, at any time after a participant has been discharged from the study, and he/she 
considers the event to be reasonably related to the intervention product  or study 
participation, the Investigator must promptly notify the sponsor.  
8.3.2.  Method of Detecting AEs and SAEs  
• The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of AEs and SAE s and 
the procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in  
Appendix 4

 consists of five items covering five dimensions (mobility, self -care, usual activities, 
pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression). Each dimension is measured by a five -point 
Likert scale (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and  
extreme problems).  Respondents are asked to choose one level that reflects their “own 
health state today ” for each of the five dimensions. Respondents can be then classified 
into one of [ADDRESS_288898] health states. The second part is a vertical  response scale (EQ -
VAS) that has endpoints labelled “best imaginable health state ” and “worst imaginable 
health state anchored at [ADDRESS_288899] represents their own health on that day.  EQ -5D-3L health states are 
converted to a single summary index by [CONTACT_2931] a formula that essentially attaches 
weights to each of the levels in each dimension. The formula is based on the valuation of 
EQ-5D health states from general population samples . 
9. STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS  
The primary estimand is the difference between mepolizumab 100  mg SC and placebo as 
add-on treatment in the rate of annualized exacerbations in participants wi th COPD 
experiencing frequent exacerbations and characterized by [CONTACT_238472], regardless of 
IP discontinuation or changes in background medication/starting a prohibited medication, 
in the absence of COVID -[ADDRESS_288900] will be considered statistically significant at the two -sided 5% alpha 
level (one -sided 2.5%).  
9.2. Sample Size Determination  
The primary analysis is based on comparing the annuali zed rate of moderate/severe 
exacerbations in participants treated with mepolizumab [ADDRESS_288901] the superiority of mepolizumab 100 mg compared to 
placebo will be:  
H0: μi = μ p  
where μ i is the annuali zed exacerbation rate on the mepolizumab 100 mg SC arm and μ p 
is the annualized  exacerbation rate on the placebo arm.  
The (one -sided) alternative hypothesis is that the annualized  exacerbation rate is lower on 
the mepol izumab arm:  
Ha: μi< μ p 
The estimated annualized  rate of moderate/severe exacerbations in the placebo arm was 
1.7 exacerbations  (based on exacerbation data observed from studies MEA117113 and 
MEA117106 [High Stratum], which were conducted  prior to the COVID -19 pandemic ).

  208657  
 Protocol Amendment 6  
 90 
 Based on a true population reduction of 23% in the annualized  rate of moderate/severe 
exacerbations following treatment with mepolizumab 100 mg SC compared to placebo, it 
was estimated that 400 participants per arm (800 participants in total) are required to 
provide 90% power to detect a statistically significant reduction at the 2 -sided 5% level 
of significance. The smallest observed effect which is predicted to result in a st atistically 
significant difference between mepolizumab 100 mg SC compared to placebo is 15%.  
To account for the loss of patient years’ data from participants who withdraw early from 
the trial and no longer provide any data (on - or off -treatment), the samp le size includes an 
additional 44 patients to account for approximately 5.5% of patient -years data being 
missing, this being the level of missing data encountered in study MEA117113.  
The sample size estimate is based on the number of moderate/severe exace rbations per 
year following a negative binomial distribution [ Keene , 2007].  The estimate of 1.7 
moderate/severe exacerbations per year in the placebo arm a nd of 0.55 for the dispersion 
parameter are based on data observed from studies MEA117113 and MEA117106 (High 
Stratum). Overall in this study, a total of approximately 800 participants will be 
randomized with a randomization ratio of 1:1 placebo: mepolizum ab 100 mg SC.   
Blinded re -evaluation s of the sample size will be carried out prior to randomizing the 
800th participant to assess  whether, based on the overall annualized rate of 
moderate/severe exacerbations and the level of dispersion seen within the available data, 
the initial planned sample size of 800 randomized participants would continue to provide 
90% power for this study.   The sample size re -estimation will follow the method 
described in [Friede , 2010].   A negative binomial distribution will be fitted to the blinded 
exacerbati ons from the available data with participant follow -up time as an offset, and 
estimates obtained for the overall exacerbation rate and the dispersion (shape) 
parameter.   These estimates will be used to re -calculate the sample size that would be 
required to  provide 90% power.   If the re -estimated sample size is less than or equal to 
the currently planned 800 randomized participants, the study will continue as planned; 
otherwise the study sample size may be increased to that indicated by [CONTACT_238522] -estimation, 
with a potential maximum increase to 1 400 participants. Further blinded re -evaluations 
will be conducted to monitor whether the sample size continues to be appropriate given 
the emerging event rate. The total sample size will be between 800 as originally pla nned 
up to a potential maximum of 1400 participants.  
9.2.1.  Sample Size Sensitivity  
The sample size in Section 9.2 is based on an assumed exacerbation rate of 1.7 
exacerbations per year in the placebo group and an expected reduction of 23% in this rate 
for participants treated with mepolizumab. If the tru e placebo exacerbation rate or the 
expected reduction with mepolizumab differ from these assumptions then, at the given 
sample size, there will be an effect on the power of the study. Table [ADDRESS_288902]

additional 44 participants to account for early study withdrawals), and a dispersion

9.3. Populations for Analyses  
For purposes of analysis, the following populations are defined:  
Population  Description  
All Participants Enrolled 
(ASE)  All participants for whom a record exists on the study database. 
This population will be used for summarizing  reasons for screen 
and run-in failures.  
Modified Intent -to-Treat 
(mITT)  All randomized participants who receive at least one dose of trial 
medication. Primary population for analysis of efficacy endpoints 
data by [CONTACT_106180].  
Safety  All randomized participants who receive at least one dose of trial 
medication. Analysis of safety endpoints b y actual treatment 
received for more than 50% of treatment administrations.  
Per-Protocol (PP)  All participants in the mITT population not identified as protocol 
deviators with respect to criteria that are considered to impact the 
primary efficacy endpoint. Population for supplementary analysis 
of primary endpoint.  
TMF-[ADDRESS_288904] one 
pharmacokinetic sample was obtained, analysed and was 
measurable. Population for the PK sub -study analysis.  
 
9.4. Statistical Analyses  
All analyses will be carried out using all available data and will be detailed in the 
Reporting and Analysis Plan (RAP) , incl uding details on additional analyses to assess the 
impact of COVID -19 on this study . 
9.4.1.  Efficacy Analyses  
Endpoint  Statistical Analysis Methods  
Primary  The primary estimand is defined by [CONTACT_6570]:  
Population: Participants with COPD experiencing frequent exacerbations and 
characterized by [CONTACT_238523]: Mepolizumab vs. placebo (both as add -on treatment  to 
standard of care)  
Variable: Number of moderate or severe exacerbations  
Summary Measure : Ratio of the freq uency of exacerbations in the 
mepolizumab treatment arm to the frequency in the placebo arm. Exacerbation 
rates will be expressed as an annualized exacerbation rate p.a.  
Strategies for intercurrent events:  
A treatment policy strategy will be used for the i ntercurrent event s of 
discontinuation of study medication , use of medication prohibited by [CONTACT_12695] , and investigational product interruption of [ADDRESS_288905] 
occurred as a result of disruptions or restrictions (e.g. lockdown measures, 
social distancing) imposed due to the COVID -19 pandemic. Full details  will be 
provided in the RAP.  
The target population for the estimand is as defined by [CONTACT_238524]/exclusion criteria and therefore the modified Intent -to-Treat population 
will be the primary population for efficacy analyses.  
Participant s who premat urely discontinue study treatment (for any reason) will 
not be required to withdraw from the study and every effort will be made by [CONTACT_238525]-13811028  CONFIDENTIAL

 Endpoint  Statistical Analysis Methods  
investigator/site staff to encourage the participant to remain in the study for 
continued collection of efficacy and saf ety data.   
Exacerbations reported by [CONTACT_238526]/severe exacerbations will use a 
negative binomial model, including bot h on-treatment and, where available, off -
treatment exacerbation data.  Any remaining missing data will be considered 
missing at random (MAR).  This model will include covariates of smoking status 
(current vs previous smoker), number of exacerbations in pre vious year, 
baseline disease severity (as % predicted post -bronchodilator FEV 1) and 
geographic region. The rate of moderate/sev ere exacerbations will be analys ed 
using a negative binomial regression model . 
Sensitivity analyses to th e assumption regarding missing data will be performed 
using multiple imputation methods based on pattern mixture models. These 
sensitivity analyses will include an off -treatment imputation approach based on 
the off -treatment data collected from participants  who continue in the study 
following early discontinuation of randomized treatment and a tippi[INVESTIGATOR_30350].  Further details will be provided in the RAP.  
Full details of the analysis methods to be used will be provided in the RAP.  
Secondary  For all secondary endpoints the target population , treatment comparison and 
strategies for intercurrent events will be the same as for the primary estimand.  
For the evaluation of the time to the first moderate/severe exacerbation, the 
summary comparison between tr eatments will be the hazard ratio.  
Analysis of this variable will use a Cox’s proportional hazards model allowing 
for covariates of smoking status (current vs previous smoker), number of 
exacerbations in previous year, baseline disease severity (as % pred icted post -
bronchodilator FEV 1) and geographic region. Missing values will be considered 
as censored at random (non -informative censoring). Summaries and graphs of 
the Kaplan -Meier estimates of the proportion of participants with a 
moderate/severe exacerba tion over time will be produced.  
The proportion of CAT score responders at Week [ADDRESS_288906] ic regression model adjusting for baseline CAT score,

or restr ictions imposed due to the COVID -19 pandemic  on or before the 
Week  52 visit, will be included in the analysis as a non -responder. Sensitivity 
analyses to the assumption regarding missing data will be performed using 
multiple imputation methods based on pattern mixture models. Analysis will be 
performed using a logistic regression model adjusting for baseline SGRQ  total 
score, smoking  status and geographic region.  
The proportion of E-RS: COPD  responders at Week [ADDRESS_288907] for the primary and secondary endpoints is 
mepolizumab 100 mg SC vs placebo in the mITT population.  A hierarchical testing 
procedure will be used to provide strong control of Type I error for multiplicity arising 
from the primary and multiple secondary endpoints.  This will be carried out using a step -
down closed testing procedure where inference for an endpoint in the predefined 
hierarchy will be dependent on statistical significance having been achieved for the 
previo us endpoints in the hierarchy.  
For example, for the primary endpoint, mepolizumab will be compared to placebo at a 
two-sided α=0.05 (one -sided α=0.025).  The next endpoint in the hierarchy (i.e. the first 
secondary endpoint) will be tested only if the tes t for the primary endpoint is significant 
at the one -sided 2.5% level. Testing will continue down the hierarchy for the remaining 
endpoints in an equivalent manner  only if the previous endpoint in the hierarchy achieves 
statistical significance.   
The hier archy of the primary and secondary endpoints to be tested is as follows:  
1. Annualized  rate of moderate/severe exacerbations (primary endpoint)  
2. Time to first moderate/severe exacerbation

 10.4.  Appendix 4: Adverse Events: Definitions and Procedures for 
Recording, Evaluating, Follow -up, and Reporting  
10.4.1.  Definition of AE  
AE Definition  
• An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, 
temporally associated with the use of a study intervention, whether or not 
considered related to the study intervention.  
• NOTE: An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including 
an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) 
temporally associated with the use of a study intervention.  
 
Events Meeting  the AE Definition  
• Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or 
urinalysis) or other safety assessments ( e.g., ECG, radiological scans, vital signs 
measurements), in cluding those that worsen from B aseline, considered clinically  
significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the investigator ( i.e., not 
related to progression of underlying disease).  
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of  the condition.  
• New conditions detected or diagnosed after study intervention administration even 
though it may have been present before the start of the study.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction.  
• Signs, symptoms , or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study 
intervention or a concomitant medication. Overdose per se will not be reported as 
an AE/SAE unless it is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self -
harming intent. Such overd oses should be reported regardless of sequelae.  
• “Lack of efficacy ” or “failure of expected pharmacological action ” per se will not 
be reported as an AE or SAE. Such instances will be captured in the efficacy 
assessments. However, the signs, symptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting 
from lack of efficacy will be reported as AE or SAE if they  fulfil  the definition of  
an AE or SAE.  
 
Events NOT  Meeting the AE Definition  
• Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safety 
assessments which are associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by 
[CONTACT_238533]’s condition.  
TMF-13811028  CONFIDENTIAL   
  208657  
 Protocol Amendment 6  
 106 
 • The disease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of 
the disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the 
participant’s condition.  
• Medical or surgical procedure  (e.g., endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that 
leads to the procedure is the AE.  
• Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]).  
• Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing  disease(s) or condition(s) 
present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen.  
 
10.4.2.  Definition of SAE  
If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious 
conditions are met (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1080]/sy mptoms of the disease under study, 
death due to progression of disease).  
A SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose:  
o Results in death  
o Is life -threatening  
The term ‘life-threatening ’ in the definition of ‘serious ’ refers to an event in which the 
participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, 
which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe.  
Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_238454], hospi[INVESTIGATOR_19949] (usually 
involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12332]/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the phys ician’s office or 
outpatient setting. Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_42244]. If a 
complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_238455], the event is 
serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” occurred or was necessary, the 
AE should be considered serious.  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a pre -existing condition that did n ot worsen 
from B aseline is not considered an AE.  
Results in persistent disability/incapacity  
• The term disability means a subst antial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct 
normal life functions.  
• This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical 
significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea , 
influenza, and accidental  trauma ( e.g., sprained ankle) which may interfere with or 
prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.  
TMF-13811028  CONFIDENTIAL   
  208657  
 Protocol Amendment 6  
 107 
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
Other situations:  
• Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE 
reporting is appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that 
may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_238456]. These events 
should usually be considered serious.  
Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in 
an emergency room or at home for allergic  bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or development of drug dependency or 
drug abuse.  (See Section 7.1 and Appendix 7 for additional events defined as SAEs) . 
10.4.3.  Definition of Cardiovascular Events  
Cardiovascular Events (CV) Definition:  
Investigators will be required to fill out the specific CV event page of the CRF for the 
following AEs and SAEs:  
• Myocardial infarction/unstable angina  
• Congestive heart failure  
• Arrhythmias  
• Valvulopathy  
• Pulmonary hypertension  
• Cerebrovascular events/stroke and transient ischemic attack  
• Peripheral arterial thromboembolism  
• Deep venous thrombosis/pulmonary embolism  
• Revascularization  
10.4.4.  Recording and Follow -Up of AE and SAE  
AE and SAE Recording  
• When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all 
documentation ( e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1088], laboratory, and diagnostics reports) 
related to the event.  
• The investigator will then record all relevant AE/SAE information in the CRF.  
• It is not accepta ble for the investigator to send photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_10914]’s 
medical records to [COMPANY_004] in lieu of completion of the AE/SAE CRF page.  
TMF-13811028  CONFIDENTIAL   
  208657  
 Protocol Amendment 6  
 108 
 • There may be instances when copi[INVESTIGATOR_31784]. In this case, all participa nt identifiers, with the exception of the 
participant number, will be redacted on the copi[INVESTIGATOR_31785].  
• The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, 
symptoms, and/or other clinica l information. Whenever possible, the diagnosis 
(not the individual signs/symptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE.  
Assessment of Intensity  
The investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported 
during the study and assign it to 1 of the following categories:  
• Mild: An event that is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_2299], causing minimal 
discomfort and not interfering with everyday activities.  
• Moderate: An event that causes sufficient discomfort and interferes with normal 
everyday activities.  
• Severe: An event that prevents normal everyday activities. An AE that is assessed 
as severe should not be confused with an SAE. S evere is a category utilized for 
rating the intensity of an event; and both AE and SAE can be assessed as severe.  
An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets at least 1 of the predefined 
outcomes as described in the definition of an SAE, NOT when it is rated as severe.  
 
Assessment of Causality  
• The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between study intervention 
and each occurrence of each AE/SAE.  
• A “reasonable possibility ” of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, 
and/or arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot 
be ruled out.  
• The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship.  
• Alternative causes, suc h as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other 
risk factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study intervention 
administration will be considered and investigated.  
• The investigator will also consult the Investigator’s Broch ure and/or Product 
Information, for marketed products, in his/her assessment.  
• For each AE/SAE, the investigator must  document in the medical notes that 
he/she has reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality.  
• There may be situations in w hich an SAE has occurred,  and the investigator has 
minimal information to include in the initial report to [COMPANY_004]. However, it is very 
important that the investigator always make an assessment of causality for 
every event before the initial transmission of th e SAE data to [COMPANY_004] . 
TMF-13811028  CONFIDENTIAL   
  208657  
 Protocol Amendment 6  
 109 
 • The investigator may change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_9242] -up 
information and send an SAE follow -up report with the updated causality 
assessment.  
• The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory 
reporting requirements.  
 
Follow -up of AE and SAE  
• The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by [CONTACT_42383]/or c ausality of the AE or SAE as fully as possible. This 
may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological 
examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals.  
• If a participant dies during participation in the study or  during a recognized 
follow -up period, the investigator will provide [COMPANY_004] with a copy of any post -
mortem findings including histopathology  
• New or updated information will be recorded in the originally completed CRF.  
• The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to [COMPANY_004] within 24 hours of 
receipt of the information.  
 
10.4.5.  Reporting of SAE to [COMPANY_004]  
SAE Reporting to [COMPANY_004]  via Electronic Data Collection Tool  
• The primary mechanism for reporting SAE to [COMPANY_004] will be the electronic data 
collection tool.  
• If the electronic  system is unavailable, then the site will use the paper SAE data 
collection tool (see next section) in order to report the event within 24 hours.  
• The site will enter the SAE data into the electronic system as soon as it becomes 
available.  
• After the study is completed at a given site, the electronic data collection tool will 
be taken off -line to prevent the entry of new data or changes to existing data.  
• If a site receives a report of a new SAE from a study participant or receives 
updated data on a previousl y reported SAE after the electronic data collection tool 
has been taken off -line, then the site can report this information on a paper SAE 
form (see next section) or to the medical monitor  by [CONTACT_756].  
• Contacts for SAE reporting can be found in SRM.  
SAE Reporting to [COMPANY_004] via Paper CRF  
• Facsimile transmission of the SAE paper CRF is the preferred method to transmit 
this information to the Medical M onitor .   
TMF-13811028  CONFIDENTIAL

 • In rare circumstances and in the absence of facsimile equipment, notification by 
[CONTACT_238534] a copy of the SAE data collection tool sent by 
[CONTACT_22855].  
• Initial notification via telephone does not replace the need for the investigator to 
complete and sign the SAE CRF pages within the designated reporting time 
frames.  
• Contacts for SAE reporting can be found in SRM.

 10.5.  Appendix  5: Contraceptive Guidance and Collection of 
Pregnancy Information  
10.5.1.  Definitions:  
Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP)  
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming post-menopausal 
unless permanently sterile (see below).  
If fertility is unclear ( e.g., amenorrhea in adolescents or athl etes) and a menstrual cycle 
cannot be confirmed before first dose of study intervention, additional evaluation should 
be considered.  
Wom en in the following categories are not considered WOCBP  
1. Premenarchal  
2. Premenopausal female with 1 of the following:  
• Documented hysterectomy  
• Documented bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656]  
• Documented bilateral oophorectomy  
For individuals with permanent infertility due to an alternate medical cause other 
than the above, ( e.g., mullerian  agenesis, androgen insensitivity), investigator 
discretion should be applied to determining study entry.  
Note: Documentation can come from the site personnel’s: review of the 
participant’ s medical records, medical examination, or medical history interview.  
3. Postmenopausal female  
• A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an 
alternative medical cause.  
• A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenop ausal 
range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not 
using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy (HRT). 
However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, confirmation with 
more than one FSH measurement is required.  
• Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to 
use one of the non -estrogen hormonal highly effective contraception methods 
if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must 
discontinue HRT to allow confirmat ion of postmenopausal status before 
study enrollment.

 10.5.2.  Contraception Guidance:  
• CONTRACEPTIVESa ALLOWED DURING THE STUDY INCLUDE:  
• Highly Effective Methodsb That Have Low User Dependency Failure rate of <1% per 
year when used consistently and correctly.  
• Implantable progestogen -only hormone contraception associated with inhibition of ovulationc 
• Intrauterine device (IUD)  
• Intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS)c 
• Bilateral tubal occlusion  
• Vasectomized partner  
• Note: Vasectomized partner is a highly eff ective contraceptive method provided 
that the partner is the sole sexual partner of the woman of childbearing potential and 
the absence of sperm has been confirmed. If not, an additional highly effective method 
of contraception should be used. Spermatogene sis cycle is approximately 90 days.  
• Highly Effective Methodsb That Are User Dependent  Failure rate of <1% per year when 
used consistently and correctly.  
• Combined (estrogen - and progestogen -containing) hormonal contraception associated with 
inhibition of ovulationc 
• oral 
• intravaginal  
• transdermal  
• injectable  
• Progestogen -only hormone contraception associated with inhibition of ovulationc 
• oral 
• injectable  
• Sexual abstinence  
• Note: Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined 
as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated 
with the study intervention. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated 
in relation to the duration of the study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of t he 
participant.  
a. Contraceptive use by [CONTACT_238535].  
b. Failure rate of <1% per year when used consistently and correctly. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_44785] f ailure rates differ from those 
when used consistently and correctly.  
c. If locally required, in accordance with Clinical Trial Facilitation Group (CTFG) guidelines, acceptable 
contraceptive methods are limited to those which inhibit ovulation as the primary m ode of action.  
 
Note: Periodic abstinence (calendar, sympto -thermal , post -ovulation methods), withdrawal (coitus interruptus), 
spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhoea method (LAM) are not acceptable methods of contraception. Male 
condom and female co ndom should not be used together (due to risk of failure with friction)

 10.5.3.  Collection of Pregnancy Information:  
Female Participants who become pregnant  
• Investigator will collect pregnancy information on any female participant, who 
becomes pregnant while participating in this study  and up to [ADDRESS_288914] 
dose of study intervention.   
• Information will be recorded on the appropriate form and submitted to [COMPANY_004] within 
24 hours of learning of a participant ’s pregnancy.  
• Participant will be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. The 
investigator will collect follow up information on participant and neonate, which will 
be forwarded to [COMPANY_004] Generally, follow -up will not be required for longer than 6 to 8 
weeks be yond the estimated delivery date.   
• Any termination of pregnancy will be reported, regardless of fetal status (presence or 
absence of anomalies) or indication for procedure.  
• While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any pregnancy 
compli cation or elective termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be 
reported as an AE or SAE.  
• A spontaneous abortion (occurring at < 22 weeks gestational age) or sti ll birth 
(occurring at > 22 weeks gestational age)  is always considered to be an SAE a nd will 
be reported as such.  
• Any SAE occurring as a result of a post -study pregnancy which is considered 
reasonably related to the study intervention by [CONTACT_093], will be reported to 
[COMPANY_004] as described in  Appendix 4. While the investigator is not obligated to actively 
seek this information in former study participants, he or she may learn of an SAE 
through spontaneous reporting.  
Any female participant w ho becomes pregnant while partici pating will discontinue study 
intervention

Deficiencies : Definition and Procedures for Recording, 
Evaluating, Follow -up, and Reporting  in Medical Device 
Studies  
• The definitions and procedures detailed in this appendix are in accordance with 
ISO [ZIP_CODE] and European Medical Device Regulation (MDR) 2017/745 for 
clinical device research.  
• Both the investigator and the sponsor will comply with all local medical device 
reporting requirements for medical devices.  
• The detection and documentation procedures described in this protocol apply to 
all [COMPANY_004] medical devices provided for use in the study (see Section 6.1.[ADDRESS_288918] of [COMPANY_004] medical devices).  
 
10.8.1.  Definition of Med ical Device AE and ADE  
Medical Device Incident Definition  
•  An AE is any untoward medical occurrence, in a clinical study participant,  or 
other persons e.g., Investigator, study site staff,  nurse etc.,   temporally associated 
with the use of study intervention  whether or not considered related to the 
investigational medical device. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease 
(new or exacerbated) temporally associated with  the use of an investigational 
medical device. This definition includes events related to the investigational 
medical device or comparator and events related to the procedures involved.  
• An adverse device effect (ADE) is an AE related to the use of an inves tigational 
medical device. This definition includes any AE resulting from insufficient or 
inadequate instructions for use, deployment, or operation, or any malfunction of 
the investigational medical device as well as any event resulting from use error or 
from intentional misuse of the investigational medical device.

 10.8.2.  Definition of Medical Device SAE, SADE and [LOCATION_003]DE  
 A Medical Device SAE is any serious adverse event that:  
a. Led to death  
b. Led to serious deterioration in the health of the participant,  that either resulted 
in: 
• A life -threatening illness or  injury . The term ‘life -threatening' in the definition 
of ‘serious' refers to an event in which the participant was at risk of death at the 
time of the event. It does not refer to an event, which hypothetica lly might have 
caused death, if it were more severe.  
•  A permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function.  
•  Inpatient or  prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a pre -
existing condition, or a procedure required by [CONTACT_760], without serious 
deterioration in health, is not considered an SAE.  
• Medical or surgical intervention  to prevent life-threatening illne ss or injury or 
permanent impairment to a body structure or a body function   
 
c. Led to fetal distress, fetal death or a congenital abnormality or birth defect  
SADE definition  
• A SADE is defined as an adverse device effect that has resulted in any of the 
consequences characteristic of a serious adverse event.  
• Any device deficiency that might have led to an SAE if appropriate action had not 
been taken, intervention had not occurred, or circumstances had been less fortunate.  
Unanticipated SADE ([LOCATION_003]DE) defin ition  
• An [LOCATION_003]DE (also identified as UADE in US Regulations 21 CFR 813.3),  is a 
serious adverse device effect that by [CONTACT_5942], incidence, severity or outcome has 
not been identified in the current version of the benefit/risk assessment (see 
Section 2.3). 
10.8.3.  Definition of  Device  Deficiency  
Device Deficiency Definition  
•  A device deficiency is an inadequacy of a medical device with respect to its 
identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety, or performance. Device deficiencies 
include malfunctions, use errors, and information supplied by [CONTACT_3455] .

 10.8.4.  Recording and Follow -Up of AE and/or SAE and Device 
Deficiencies  
AE, SAE and Device Deficiency Recording  
• When an AE/SAE/device deficiency occurs, it is the responsibility of the 
investigator to review all documentation (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1088], laboratory 
reports, and diagnostics reports) related to the event.  
• The investigator will  then record all relevant AE/SAE/device deficiency 
information in the participant’s medical records, in accordance with the 
investigator’s normal clinical practice, and on the appropriate form.  
• It is not acceptable for the investigator to send photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_10914]’s 
medical records to [COMPANY_004]  in lieu of completion of the [COMPANY_004] /AE/SAE/device 
deficiency form.  
• There may be instances when copi[INVESTIGATOR_31784] . In this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of the 
participant number, will be redacted on the copi[INVESTIGATOR_31785].  
• The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on si gns, 
symptoms, and/or other clinical information. Whenever possible, the diagnosis 
(not the individual signs/symptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE.  
• For device deficiencies, it is very important that the investigator describes any 
corrective or remedia l actions taken to prevent recurrence of the deficiency.  
o A remedial action is any action other than routine maintenance or servicing of 
a medical device where such action is necessary to prevent recurrence of a 
device deficiency. This includes any amendmen t to the device design to 
prevent recurrence.  
Assessment of Intensity  
• The investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE/SAE/device 
deficiency reported during the study and assign it to one of the following 
categories:  
• Mild: An event that  is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_2299], causing minimal 
discomfort and not interfering with everyday activities.  
• Moderate: An event that causes sufficient discomfort and interferes with normal 
everyday activities.  
• Severe: An event that prevents normal eve ryday activities. An AE that is assessed 
as severe should not be confused with an SAE. Severe is a category used for rating 
the intensity of an event; both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as severe.  
TMF-13811028  CONFIDENTIAL   
  208657  
 Protocol Amendment 6  
 121 
 • An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets at least 1 of  the predefined outcomes 
as described in the definition of an SAE, not when it is rated as severe.  
 
Assessment of Causality  
• The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between study intervention 
and each occurrence of each AE/SAE/device deficiency  
• A “reasonable possibility” of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, 
and/or arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot 
be ruled out.  
• The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship.  
• Alternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other 
risk factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study intervention 
administration will be considered and investigated.  
• The investigator will also consult the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) and/or 
Instruction Direction For Use  (IDFU ) or Product Information, for marketed 
products, in his/her assessment.  
• For each AE/SAE/device deficiency, the investigator must  document in the 
medical notes that he/s he has reviewed the AE/SAE/device deficiency and has 
provided an assessment of causality.  
• There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investigator has 
minimal information to include in the initial report to [COMPANY_004]. However, it is very 
importa nt that the investigator always make an assessment of causality for every 
event before the initial transmission of the SAE data to [COMPANY_004].  
• The investigator may change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_9242] -up 
information and send an SAE follow -up rep ort with the updated causality 
assessment.  
• The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory 
reporting requirements.  
 
Follow -up of AE/SAE/device deficiency  
• The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct  of 
supplemental measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as 
requested by [CONTACT_238536]/or causality of the 
AE/SAE/device deficiency as fully as possible. This may include additional 
laboratory tests or investigations, hi stopathological examinations, or 
consultation with other health care professionals.

 Protocol Amendment 6  
 122 
 • If a participant dies during participation in the study or during a recognized 
follow -up period, the investigator will provide [COMPANY_004] with a copy of any 
post-mortem findings i ncluding histopathology.  
• New or updated information will be recorded in the originally completed CRF.  
• The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to [COMPANY_004] within 24 hours of 
receipt of the information.  
 
10.8.5.  Reporting of SAEs  
SAE Reporting to [COMPANY_004] via an Electronic Data Collection Tool  
• The primary mechanism for reporting an SAE to [COMPANY_004] will be the electronic data 
collection tool.  
• If the electronic system is unavailable, then the site will use the paper SAE data 
collection tool (see next table) in order to report the event within 24 hours.  
• The site will enter the SAE data into the electronic system as soon as it becomes 
available.  
• After the study is completed at a given site, the electronic data collection tool will 
be taken offline to prevent the entry of new data or changes to existing data.  
• If a site receives a report of a new SAE from a study participant or receives updated 
data on a previously reported SAE after the electronic data collection tool has been 
taken off -line, then the site can report this i nformation on a paper SAE form (see 
next section).  
• Contacts for SAE reporting can be found in SRM . 
 
SAE Reporting to [COMPANY_004] via Paper Data Collection Tool  
• Facsimile transmission of the SAE data collection tool is the preferred method to 
transmit this information to the [COMPANY_004] medical monitor.  
• Initial notification via telephone does not replace the need for the investigator to 
complete and sign the SAE paper data collection tool within the designated 
reporting time frames.  
• Contacts for SAE reporting can be  found in SRM .

 10.8.6.  Reporting of SADEs  
SADE Reporting to [COMPANY_004]  
NOTE: There are additional reporting obligations for medical device deficiencies 
that are potentially related to SAEs that must fulfill the legal responsibility to notify 
appropriate regulatory authorities and other entities about certain safety 
information rela ting to medical devices being used in clinical studies.  
• Any device deficiency that is associated with an SAE must be reported to [COMPANY_004] 
within 24 hours after the investigator determines that the event meets the definition 
of a device deficiency.  
• [COMPANY_004] will rev iew all device deficiencies and determine and document in writing 
whether they could have led to an SAE. These device deficiencies will be reported 
to the regulatory authorities and IRBs/IECs as required by [CONTACT_2091].

Home healthcare is defined as :  
• visits at the participant’s home, and  
• telemedicine visits . 
Where applicable country and local regulations and infrastructure allow , home health 
care can be performed at the discretion of  the investigator  and following the participant 
signing of a n informed  consent  form specific for home healthcare .  
Home visits at the participant’s home  
These are performed at the participant’s home by a qualified home healthcare personnel 
(e.g., nurse) when the participants is unable to attend a site visit due to COVID -19 
restrictions and the Investigator deems that a site visit is not necessary.   See the SRM for 
details.

≥150/μL in the 12 months prior to Screening 
Visit 0 that was measured between 12 months 
and 1 month prior to Visit 0, and that was not 
measured within 14 days of a COPD 
exacerbation.  
Participants with no documented historical 
blood eosinophil count of ≥150 cells/µL must 
meet this threshold at the Screening Visit 1  
Updated inclusion criterion # 5: Two or more 
moderate COPD exacerbations that were 
treated with systemic corticosteroids

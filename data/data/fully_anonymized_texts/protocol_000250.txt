Protocol INCB [ZIP_CODE]- 202 Am 7 Version 7  02 APR  2020  
CONFIDENTIAL  Clinical Assessments : 
Adverse event assessments, vital signs, electrocardiograms, physical examinations, ECOG performance 
status, comprehensive eye examinations, and tumor and disease response assessments will be performed by [CONTACT_3878].   
An objective assessment of disease status will be performed at screening.  Subsequently , disease status 
including RECIST radiological response assessment will be assessed  every [ADDRESS_197368] 4 cycles 
and every 3 cycles thereafter.  A central radiology group will be contracted to provide centralize d reading 
on all assessments.   
Estimated Duration of Participation:    
Up to [ADDRESS_197369] is receiving benefit and has not met any criteria for study withdrawal, and 30 days 
(+5 days) for safety follow -up following the last dose of the study drug.  Subjects will be followed -up for 
overall survival following documented disease progression. 
Estimated  Number of Subjects:    
Approximately 140 subjects will be enrolled  (approximately 100 subjects in Cohort A, and approximately  
20 subjects into Cohort B and Cohort C [US only]  each). 
Principal Coordinating Investigator:   , MD  
Statistical Methods:    
Primary analysis will be performed on FGFR2 translocated subjects.  Approximately 100 subjects with 
documentation of FGFR2 translocation from the central  genomics la boratory are planned for the final 
analysis of the primary endpoint of ORR .  With the assumed rates of 33% for the intervention, a sample 
size of approximately 100 subjects would provide > 95 % probability to have a 95 % confidence interval 
with lower limit of > 15% assuming 10% lost to follow-up.  Up to 20 subjects will be enrolled in Cohorts 
B and C (US only) , respectively, which will provide > 80% chance of observing at least 4 responders in 
each cohort if the underlying ORR is 30%. 
The proportion of subje cts with ORR and DCR will be estimated with 95%  CI.  The PFS, DOR , and OS 
will be analyzed by [CONTACT_8761] -Meier method.  Descriptive statistics will be summarized for safety data.  
Futility Analysis  
For Cohort A (FGFR2 translocations), futility analysis will  be performed  when approximately [ADDRESS_197370] permanently discontinued study 
treatment .  Cohort A can be stopped for futility if 2 or less responders are observed, for which there is  less 
than 10% probability of claiming ORR >  15% based on a [ADDRESS_197371] a guidance and nonbinding. 
Cohorts B ( other FGF/FGFR alterations) and C ( US only; negative for FGF/FGFR alterations ) can be 
stopped if [ADDRESS_197372] a guidance and nonbinding. 
Data Monitoring Committee:    
No independent Data Monitoring Committee is planned for this study.  A study committee will be 
established and will include the investigators or designees, the sponsor representatives (eg, medical 
monitor), and when appropriate ad hoc experts.

tyrosine kinases that is proposed for the treatment of cholangiocarcinoma.  Aberrant signaling 
through FGFR resulting from gene amplification or mutation, chromosomal translocation, and 
ligand -dependent activation  of the recep tors has been demonstrated in multiple types of human 
cancers.  Fibroblast growth factor receptor signaling contributes to the developi[INVESTIGATOR_169069], survival, migration, and angiogenesis.  
Incyte is proposing to study INCB054828 for the treatment of advanced/metastatic or surgically unresectable cholangiocarcinoma.  Refer to the Investigator 's Brochure ( IB) for additional 
background information on INCB054828. 
1.1.1. Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor Inhibition in Oncology  
The mammalian FGFR family is composed of 4 highly conserved receptors (FGFR1, FGFR2, 
FGFR3, and FGFR4) that have an extracellular ligand binding domain, a single transmembrane 
domain, and an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain.  Eighteen fibroblast growth factor (FGR) 
ligands, divided into canonical and hormonal FGFRs, bind to FGFRs leading to receptor dimerization, activation  of the kinase domain, and transphosphorylation of the receptors 
(Eswarakumar  et al 2005).  Subsequent signal transduction occurs through phosphorylation of 
substrate proteins such as FGFR substrate 2 that leads to activation of the RAS -mitogen -activated protein kinase and phosphoinositide 3-kinase–protein kinase B pathway s 
and phospholipase Cγ that activates the protein kinase C pathway.  In some cellular context, signal transducer and activator of transcription proteins are also activated by [CONTACT_169086].  Signaling through the FGF-FGFR pathway is tightly controlled through feedback regulation.  
Mitogen -activated protein kinase phosphatases and Sprouty proteins are upregulated upon FGFR 
stimulation and antagonize FGF- dependent activation of extracellular signal -regulated kinases.  
In many cases, FGFR pathway activation promotes cell proliferation, survival, and migration; however, cellular context plays an important role, and in certain tissues, FGFR signaling results 
in growth arrest and cellular differentiation ( Dailey  et al 2005).  
In adults, FGF- FGFR signaling is involved in angiogenesis during wound healing.  The 
hormonal FGF ligands contribute to regulation of metabolic pathways involving lipid, glucose, phosphate, and  vitamin D ( Itoh 2010) .  Genetic defects in the FGF23 -signaling pathway lead  to 
disordered phosphate metabolism:  loss of function mutations in FGF23 or its signaling result in 
retention of phosphate and tissue mineralizing, while gain of function mutations in the FGF23 
pathway manifests as hypophosphatemic Rickets syndrome ( Farrow  and White 2010).  
There is strong genetic and functional evidence that dysregulation of FGFR can lead to the 
establishment and progression of cancer.  Genetic alterations in FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3 
have been described in many tumor types ( Knights and Cook 2010, Turner and Grose 2010 ).  
These include activating mutations, translocations, and gene amplification resulting in ligand 
independent, constitutive activation of the receptors or aberrant ligand -dependent signaling 
through FGFRs.   
Incyte Corporation  Page [ADDRESS_197381] shown that high levels of FGF ligands such as FGF2 promote cancer cell res istance to 
radiation, chemotherapeutics, and targeted cancer drugs ( Fuks et al 1994, Pardo  et al 2002, 
Terai  et al 2013).  Clinically, detection of high levels of FGF2 in tumors i s associated with 
poorer outcome in several tumor types including NSCLC ( Donnem et al 2009, Rades  et al 2012).  
A substantial body of evidence supports that genetically activated FGFR pathway sensitizes 
FGFR -altered cancer cells to knockdown or inhibition of these receptors ( Kunii et al 2008, 
Qing  et al 2009, Weiss  et al 2010, Lamont et al 2011 ).  A larg e screen of more than 500 tumor 
cell lines with a selective FGFR inhibitor demonstrated that only a small percentage (5.9%) of all cells are sensitive to FGFR inhibition, and growth suppressed cell lines were highly enriched for 
FGFR alterations ( Guagnano  et al 2012).  These results demonstrate that FGFR inhibitors are 
active in a targeted manner against cancers with activated FGFR pathway.  An implication of 
these data is that selection based on molecular -, genetic -, or protein-based diagnostic tests for 
specific FGFR alterations in tumors may be important for identifying patients  most likely to 
benefit from an FGFR inhibitor. 
Results from early clinical studies of selective FGFR inhibitors, including INCB054828 have 
shown a tol erable safety profile for the class and preliminary signs of clinical benefit in subjects 
with FGF/FGFR alterations.  An on -target pharmacologic effect of FGFR inhibition in clinical 
studies is hyperphosphatemia (HP).  In the ongoing INCB [ZIP_CODE]-101 study,  at the recommended Phase 2  dose (RP2D) of 13.5 mg, 100% of subjects developed HP  (> 5.5 mg/mL).  
Hyperphosphatemia has been managed with diet modifications and phosphate binders.   
INCB054828 is a potent selective inhibitor of FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3 and is proposed for 
the treatment of subjects with advanced/metastatic or surgically unresectable 
cholangiocarcinoma who have FGFR2 translocation, have other FGF/FGFR alteration , or are 
negative for F GF/FGFR alterations.  
1.1.2. Cholangiocarcinoma 
Cholangiocarcinoma, also known as bile duct carcinoma, is found in the intra- or extrahepatic bile ducts.  It is the second most common primary liver cancer but only accounts for approximately 3% of all gastrointestinal cancers ( Rizvi and Gores 2013).  First line therapy is 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_169070] a response rate of 30 % to 50% ( Eckman  et al 2011) and 
the 5 -year survival rate is 1 1.5% (NCI  2016). 
The incidence of cholangiocarcinoma is quite rare, with 1 to 2 patients  per 100,000 in regions 
like the US and the [LOCATION_006]; however in regions like Southeast Asia, liver fluke and other parasitic infections give rise to a much higher incidence (113 per 100,000; Bergq uist and von Seth 2015).  
Fibroblast growth factor receptor [ADDRESS_197382] common FGFR alteration in 
cholangiocarcinoma and associated with a more indolent disease state ( Churi  et al 2014, Wu  et al 
2013).  These fusions are found in 13% to 15% of patients  with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma  
(Graham  et al  2014).  Intrahepatic disease accounts for 5% of all cholangiocarcinoma, with 95% 
of patients  having extrahepatic disease ( Blechacz  and Gores 2008 ) however recent data indicates 
a rise in intrahepatic disease ( Bergquist and von Seth 2015).   Other FGF/FGFR alterations are 
not as common but can be found in the ex trahepatic cholangiocarcinoma patients  (Bergquist and 
von Seth 2015). 
Incyte Corporation  Page [ADDRESS_197383] been shown to generate overexpression of the 
FGF rece ptor, produce a receptor that is constitutively active, or lead it to a state where there is 
reduced dependence on ligand binding for activation ( Knights and Cook 2010).  
Tyrosine kinases are an especially important target in cancer therapy as they have a key role in growth factor signaling.  Several tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been shown to be effective 
antitumor agents and have been approved in multiple oncology indications ( Arora  and Scholar 
2005).   INCB054828 is a potent inhibitor of the kinase activity of FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3 
and has been shown to inhibit growth in several tumor models.   
The planned study will evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of INCB054828 in subjects 
with advanced/ metastatic or surgically un resectable cholangiocarcinoma with FGFR 2 
translocations, FGF/FGFR alterations and without FGF/FGFR alterations.  Subjects with FGFR2 
translocations are found in approximately 15% of subjects with intrahepatic cholangiocarcino ma 
(Arai et al 2013, Ross et al 2014, Ang  2015 ). 
Preliminary data from the ongoing Phase [ADDRESS_197384] FGF/FGFR genetic alterations.  In the ongoing 
Phase [ADDRESS_197385] been treated at dose levels ranging from 1 to 20 mg 
once daily for 2 weeks followed by 1 week off in 21-day cycles .  The recommended Phase 2  
starting dose has b een established at 13.5 mg once daily following the 2 weeks on/1 week off 
regimen.  This dose was recommended based on safety, pharmacokinetics ( PK), and preliminary 
signals of clinical benefit.  One subject with FGFR2-CCDC6 cholangiocarcinoma has been treated with 9  mg of INCB054828 with a confirmed partial response (PR). 
In addition, a Phase [ADDRESS_197386] frequently reported adverse event (AE)  was HP, followed by [CONTACT_29429], stomatitis, and 
alopecia.  Hyperphosphatemia was the leading dose- limiting toxicity resulting in interruptions 
and discontinuations.  The effi cacy results of this compound in the ongoing Phase [ADDRESS_197387] 
shown an overall response rate of 18.8% among 48 subjects with FGFR2 fu sions ( Javle et al 
2018).  
Amendment 5 ([ADDRESS_197388] 2017) in creases the number of subjects  enrolled into Cohort A (FGFR2 
translocation) from [ADDRESS_197389] efficacy data to inform future development 
decisions.  As the primary analysis will be based solely on Cohort A, this amendment does not 
increase the number of subjects in Cohorts B and C.  Futility analysis will be performed as 
initially planned ( before  Amendment 5), when approximately [ADDRESS_197390] prominent findings following repeat-dose exposure to INCB054828 in both rats and 
monkeys were HP, physeal dysplasia, and soft tissue mineralization.  Mineralization was 
observed in numerous tissues including the kidney, stomach, arteries (gastric and pulmonary), 
ovaries (monkey only), and eyes (cornea; rat only).  Soft tissue mineralization was not reversible, while physeal and cartilage findings were reversible.  
Hyperphosphatemia, physeal dysplasia, and soft tissue mineralization have been reported in rodents and large animals following administration of selective FGFR inhibitors ( Brown  et al 
2005, Brown  2010, Wöhrle  et al 2011, Yanochko et al 2013).  These observations can be 
explained by [CONTACT_169087].  Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF 23)–mediated signaling negatively affects renal vitamin D biosynthesis by [CONTACT_169088]27B1, which catalyzes the production of the biologically active vitamin D 
metabolite 1,25(OH)2D3, and by [CONTACT_169089]24A1, which converts 1,25(OH)2D3 into a 
metabolite that is less biologically active.  Additionally, it has been published that FGF -23 
suppresses renal phosphate reabsorption by [CONTACT_169090]-phosphate cotransporters NPT2A and NPT2C in the brush-border membrane of proximal tubule epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663] ( Baum  et al 2005, Shimada et al 2001, Shimada et al 2004a , Shimada et al 2004b).  
Wöhrle et al ( 2011) demonstrated that FGFR inhibition by [CONTACT_169091]176067 
counteracts the biologic activity of FGF-23 in the kidney, leading to HP and hypervitaminosis D. 
In rats, the mineralization was similar in distribution and morphology to that occasionally 
observed in normal animals; thus it is likely that the increased incidence of mineralization in 
various tissues at these doses represents a test article–related exacerbation of a spontaneously occurring co ndition.  While soft tissue mineralization was not reversible during 28- day recovery 
period, there was also no evidence of progression or worsening of this effect.  Soft tissue mineralization in monkeys was observed only at 3 mg/kg per day in the 10- day ra nge-finding 
study and was not assessed for reversibility.  No evidence of mineralization was found at the doses tested in the 28-day study in monkeys. 
Moderate lens opacities (capsule, posterior) in one 0.33 mg/kg per day and one 1 mg/kg per day 
males and slight attenuation of retinal vessels in one 1 mg/kg per day female were  observed in 
monkeys at the end-of-treatment (EOT) period on the 28-day Good Laboratory Practice study.  These findings were not present during the pretest period and thus a relationship to INCB054828 cannot be dismissed.  However, lens opacities are occasionally observed in normal cynomolgus 
monkeys of similar age and origin according to the testing facility historical control data.  
Persistence of lens opacity in 1 animal at the end o f recovery period suggests that this finding is 
not reversible. 
Fully reversible mild -to-moderate elevation of alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) and aspartate 
aminotransferase ( AST ) were noted at the EOT period in the 28-day monkey study at doses 
≥ 0.33 mg/kg per day; these changes were not associated with changes in other hepatobiliary 
parameters or microscopic changes in the liver.  These changes may be related to FGFR4 
inhibition, which is known to result in increases in liver function tests without histological correlates ( Pai et al 2012 ).

2. STUDY OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS  
2.1. Study Objectives  
2.1.1. Primary Objective  
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of INCB054828 in subjects with advanced/metastatic or surgically unresectable cholangiocarcinoma with FGFR2 translocation who have failed at least 1 previous treatment.  
2.1.2. Secondary Objectives 
The secondary objectives are:  
• To evaluate the efficacy of INCB054828 in subjects with advanced/metastatic or surgically unresectable cholangiocarcinoma with different molecular subgroups.   
• To evaluate the safety of INCB054828 in subjects with advanced/metastatic or surgically unresectable cholangiocarcinoma . 
• To identify and evaluate covariates that may influence the PK of INCB054828 in this 
subject population through population PK  analysis.  Additionally, exposure-response 
analyses for key efficacy and safety parameters will also be considered if sufficient data are available.  
2.2. Study Endpoints  
The genomi c testing results from the central laboratory will be used to determine cohort 
allocation for primary and secondary endpoint analyses. 
2.2.1. Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoint of this study is to determine the objective response rate (ORR) in subjects with FGFR2 translocations  based on the central genomics laboratory results.  Objective response 
rate is defined as the proportion of subjects  who achieved a complete response ( CR; 
disappearance of all target lesions ) or a PR (≥ 30% decrease in the sum of the lo ngest diameters

CONFIDENTIAL  of target lesions ) based on RECIST v 1.1.  Clinical response will be determined by [CONTACT_169093].  
2.2.2. Secondary Endpoint s 
The secondary endpoints for this study include: 
• ORR in subjects with FGF/FGFR alterations othe r than FGFR2 translocations 
(Cohort B). 
• ORR in all subjects with FGF/FGFR alterations  (Cohorts A and B). 
• ORR in subjects negative for FGF/FGFR alterations  (Cohort C [US only]). 
• Progression- free survival (PFS  = first dose to progressive disease [ PD] or deat h; all 
cohorts). 
• Duration of response (DOR = time from the date of CR or PR until PD; all cohorts). 
• Disease control r ate (DCR  = CR + PR  + stable disease [ SD]; all cohorts).

4.1. Overall Study Design  
This is an open- label, mo notherapy study of INCB054828 in subjects with advanced/metast atic 
or surgically unres ectable cholangiocarcinoma with FGFR2 translocations, with other 
FGF/FGFR alterations , or who are negative for FGF/FGFR alterations.  The study will enroll 
approximately 140 subjects total:  100 subjects with FGFR2 translocations (Cohort A), 
20 subjects with other FGF/FGFR alterations (Cohort B) , and 20 subjects with no FGF/FGFR 
alterations ( Cohort C [US only] ). 
Subjects will receive a once daily dose (QD) of INCB054828 at 13.[ADDRESS_197417] eligibility can be based on local genomic testing results, if available.  Confirmatory 
testing through the central genomics laboratory will be performed on all subjects. 
Previous therapi[INVESTIGATOR_169075], immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], with or without 
radiotherapy.  Subjects receiving radiotherapy to target lesion (s) must show progression of target 
lesion before  entry into the study. 
Genomic testing results will allow subjects to be assigned to a cohort:  
• Cohort A:  FGFR2 translocations  with a documented fusion partner in central 
laboratory report 
• Cohort B:  other F GF/FGFR alterations  
• Cohort C (US only):  negative for FGF/FGFR alterations 
Subjects enrolled based on a local sequencing report will be assigned to a cohort based on the local results.  However , final cohort assignment for statistical analysis of primary a nd secondary 
endpoints will be done based on the central genomics testing results. 
Treatment will start on Cycle 1 Day 1.  Subjects will undergo regular safety assessments during 
treatment as well as regular efficacy assessments.  Subjects will be allowed to continue 
administration  in 21-day cycles until documented disease progression or unacceptable toxicity is 
reported.  See Figure  3 for the study design.

[IP_ADDRESS]. Storage 
Bottles of tablets should be stored at room temperature, 15°C to 30°C (59°F to 86°F). 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Instruction to Subjects for Handling Study Drug (INCB 054828) 
The subject must be instructed in the handling of study drug  as follows: 
• To store the study drug  at room temperature.  
• To only remove from the study drug bott le the number of tablets needed at the time of 
administration.  
• Not to remove doses in advance of the next scheduled administration. 
• Tablets cannot be split or crushed 
• To make every effort to take doses on schedule. 
• To report any missed doses. 
• To take study drug immediately upon rising or after a [ADDRESS_197425] with a glass of 
water; the subject should refrain from eating  1 hour after taking study drug. 
• If the subject vomits after taking study drug, the subject should not take another dose 
that day.

CONFIDENTIAL  5.4. Treatment Interruptions and Adjustments  
5.4.1. Dose Modifications 
Dose interruptions and modifications may occur for individual study subjects.  The occurrence of 
toxicities (related or unrelated to study drug) will guide decisions for treatment interruptions and 
discontinuation for individual subjects.  
5.4.2. Criteria and Procedures for Dose Interrupti ons and Adjustments  of Study Drug  
Treatment with INCB0 [ZIP_CODE] may be delayed up to 14 days to allow for resolution of toxicity  
(Table 3) .  Subjects may resume treatment if no medical condition or other circumstance ex ists 
that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], would make the subject unsuitable for further 
participation in the study.  The treating investigator should contact [CONTACT_169097]  14 days before restarting 
treatment with INCB0 [ZIP_CODE]. 
Table 3: Guidelines for Interruption and Restarting of Study Drug  
ADVERSE EVENT  ACTION TAKEN 
Chemistry  
• AST and/or ALT is > 5.0 × ULN . 
Note:  In subjects with liv er 
metastasis- related elevations at baseline, 
contact [CONTACT_169098]. Step 1:   Interrupt study drug up to 2 weeks (14 days) until 
the toxicity has resolved to ≤ Grade 1 except by [CONTACT_169099].  
Step 2:   Restart study drug at same dose.  If assessed as 
related to study drug, restart study drug at next lower dose; monitor as clinically indicated.  
Other toxicities , including SRD/RPED  
• Any Grade 1 or Grade 2 toxicity. Continue study drug treatment and treat the toxicity; monitor as clinically indicated.  
• Any Grade 3 toxicity, if clinically significant and not manageab le by 
[CONTACT_90994]. Step 1:   Interrupt study drug up to 2 weeks (14 days), until 
toxicity r esolves to ≤ Grade 1. 
Step 2:   Restart study drug at same dose.  If assessed as 
related to study drug, restart study drug at next lower dose; monitor as clinically indicated.  
• Any recurrent Grade 3 toxicity after 2 dose reductions . Discontinue study drug administration and follow- up per 
Protocol.  (Exceptions require approval of sponsor.)  
• Any other Grade 4 toxicity. Discontinue study drug administration and follow- up per 
Protocol. 
For subjects who present with possible or confirmed serous retinal detachme nt/retinal pi[INVESTIGATOR_169077] (SRD/RPED) based on optic coherence tomography (OCT ), the 
guidelines in Table [ADDRESS_197427]' s treatment.  
Incyte Corporation  Page 36 of 83 
Protocol INCB [ZIP_CODE]- 202 Am 7 Version 7  02 APR  2020  
CONFIDENTIAL  Per CTCAE v4.03, there is a grading for retinal detachment ; however, this refers to 
rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (when a hole occurs in the retina)  or exudative detachment 
(fluid accumulation due to inflammatory diseases) .  There is no exact  CTCAE grading term  for 
SRD/RPED  secondary to FGFR inhibition (there is no hole in the macula, just fluid 
accumulation  or detachment of retinal pi[INVESTIGATOR_20092]).  Therefore, grading should be 
based on the CTC AE term "retinopathy ." 
Due to the fact subjects may enter the study with extensive pretreatment toxicities, the dose 
reduction rules are provided as guidelines (see Table  3). 
For dose adjustments, the sponsor recomm ends a maximum of 2 dose level reductions:  subjects 
administered  13.5 mg can decrease to 9  mg, and if additional dose reduction is required, subjects 
can decrease to  6 mg.   Dose reductions below 6 mg are not allowed.  The frequency of 
administration  remains the same (once daily) and as well as the schedule (2 weeks on treatment 
followed by 1 week off treatment). 
Adverse events that have a clear alternative explanation or transient (≤ 72 hours) abnormal 
laboratory values without associated clinically significant signs or symptoms may be exempt from dose-reduction rules. 
5.4.3. Management of Hyperphosphatemia 
Hyperphosphatemia is an expected on -target pharmacologic effect of FGFR inhibition.  
Hyperphosphatemia should be managed with diet modifications, phosphate binders and diuretics, 
or a dose reduction per the recommendations in Table 4 .

CONFIDENTIAL  5.4.4. Criteria for Permanent Discontinuation of Study Drug  
The occurrence of unacceptable toxicity not caused by [CONTACT_169100].  Unacceptable toxicity is defined as follows: 
• Occurrence of an AE that is related to treatment with the study drug that , in the 
judgment of the investigator or the sponsor's medical monitor, compromises the 
subject 's ability to continue study -specific procedures  or is considered to not be in the 
subject 's best interest.  
• An AE requiring more than 2 dose reductions. 
• Persistent AE requiring a delay of therapy for more than 21 days unless a greater 
delay has been approved by [CONTACT_456]. 
• Increase in QT/QTcF to > 500 milliseconds or to > 60 milliseconds o ver baseline.   In 
case of a QTc > [ADDRESS_197428]  be withdrawn from study treatment for the following reasons: 
• The subject becomes pregnant. 
• Consent is withdrawn.  Note  Subjects may choose to discontinue study treatment and remain in the study to be followed for progression and survival. 
• Further treatment  would be injurious to the subject's health or well-being, in the 
investigator 's medical judgment.   Subject would still be followed for progression and 
survival. 
• The stu dy is t erminated  by [CONTACT_456]. 
• The study is t erminated  by [CONTACT_169101], IRB, or IEC. 
• Unacceptable toxicity has occurred . 
• Disease progression has been reported . 
• Other anti neoplastic treatment is initiated . 
A subject  may be discontinued from study treatment as follows:  
• If, during the course of the study, a subject is found not to have met eligibility criteria but is receiving clinical benefit as per the investigator , the m edical monitor, in 
collaboration with the i nvestigator, will determine whether the subject sho uld be 
withdrawn from the study.  This includes cases where the local genomic testing result is positive for an FGF/FGFR alteration but the central genomic testing is  not. 
• If a subject is noncompliant with study procedures or study dr ug administration in the 
investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], the sponsor should be consulted for instruction on handling the subject.  
Incyte Corporation  Page [ADDRESS_197429] discontinues study treatment and actively withdraws consent for collection of 
follow-up data (safety follow-up or disease assessment), then no additional data collection 
should occur; however, subjects will have the option of withdrawing consent for study treatment 
but continuing in the follow-up period of the study for safety/efficacy assessments. 
5.7. Concomitant Medications  
5.7.1. Restricted Medications  
The use of mild or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors and OCT2 substrates, such as metformin, should involve careful monitoring in relation to safety . 
Calcium -based phosphate binding medications should not be used due to a concern for soft tissue 
mineralization.  
5.7.2. Prohibited Medications  
The following medications and measures are prohibited: 
• The concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers and 
moderate CYP3A4 inducers.  Based on the low overall bioavailability of t opi[INVESTIGATOR_169078], there are no restrictions on topi[INVESTIGATOR_147063].  See Appendix B  for a 
list of potent CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers. 
• Any concomitant use of a selective FGFR inhibitor (other than the study drug) 
• Investigational study drug for any indication. 
• Use of any anticancer medications other than the study medication.  
6. STUDY ASSESSMENTS  
All study assessments will be performed as indicated  in the schedule of assessments ( Table 5 ), 
and all laboratory assessments will be performed as indicated in Table 6 . 
Table 7 presents a summary of clinical laboratory analytes to be assessed.   The o rder of

CONFIDENTIAL  6.1. Prescreening and Screening  
Prescreening is available for subjects without a genomic testing  report  (results within 
approximately 2 years of screening are valid for this study ).  Prescreening allows genomic 
testing to be performed outside of the 28-day screening window. 
Screening is the interval between signing the ICF and the day  that the subject is enrolled in the 
study (Cycle  1 Day  1).  Screening may not exceed [ADDRESS_197435]' s routine clinical management (eg, blood count, 
imaging study) and obtained before signing of informed consent may be us ed for screening or 
baseline purposes provided that the procedure meets the Protocol- defined criteria and has been 
performed in the time  frame of the study (ie, within 28 days of Cycle 1 Day 1).  All information 
associated with eligibility requirements must be entered into the appropriate eCRF pages . 
Results from the screening visit evaluations will be reviewed to confirm subject eligibility  before 
enrollment or the administration of study drug.  Tests with results that fail eligibility requirements may be repeated once during screening if the investigator believes the results to be in error.  For screening assessments that are repeated, the most recent available result before 
treatment assignment will be used to determine subject eligibility.  Treatment should start as 
soon as possible, but within [ADDRESS_197436] who fails screening may repeat the screening process 1  time if the investigator believes that there has  been 
a change in eligibility status (eg, after recovery from an infection).   Subjects who are rescreened 
will receive a new subject number through the IRT. 
6.2. Treatment  
The treatment period begins on the day that  the subject receives the first dose of study drug 
(Cycle 1 Day 1) through the point at which the investigator  determines that the subject will be 
permanently discontinued from study drug.  Cycle [ADDRESS_197437] has signed the ICF and no more than 3 days after the date of enrollment.  Dates for subsequent study visits will be determined based on this day and should occur within 3 days (+/- ) 
of the scheduled date unless delayed for safety reasons.  At Cycle [ADDRESS_197438] 
should be encouraged to return for the follow-up v isit.

CONFIDENTIAL  6.4. Follow -Up 
6.4.1. Safety Follow- Up 
The safety follow-up period  is the interval between the EOT visit and the scheduled follow-up 
visit, which should occur 30 to 35 days after the EOT visit (or after the last dose of study drug  if 
the EOT visit was not performed).  A dverse events  and SAEs must be reported up until at least 
[ADDRESS_197439] information regarding disease status until: 
• The start of new antineoplastic therapy.  
• Disease progression . 
• Death . 
• The end of the study.  
6.4.3. Survival Follow- Up 
Once a subject has received the last dose of study drug, confirmed disease progression, or starts a 
new anticancer therapy, the subject moves into the survival follow-up period and should be contact[CONTACT_5143], email, or visit at least every [ADDRESS_197440] before any study- specific 
procedures are conducted using an ICF approved by [CONTACT_1036]/IEC that contains all elements 
required by [CONTACT_12212] E6 and describes the nature, scope, and pos sible consequences of the study  in a 
form understandable to the study subject.  Local and institutional guidelines for ICF content and 
administration must be followed; the original signed ICF must be retained by [CONTACT_093], 
and a copy of the signed ICF must be provided to the study subject.  The informed consent process for each subject must be documented in writing w ithin the  subject source documentation. 
7.2. Interactive Response Technology  Procedure 
The IRT will be contact[CONTACT_147101] a subject ID number when a subject enters screening.  Upon 
determining that the subject is eligible for study entry, the IRT will be contact[CONTACT_169103].   Additionally, the IRT will be contact[CONTACT_169104].  See appropriate information  in Section  5.1.1. 
7.3. Demography and Medical History 
7.3.1. Demographics and General Medical History  
Demographic data and general medical history  will be collected at  screening.  
7.3.2. Disease Characteristics and Treatment History  
A disease- targeted medical and medication history will be collected at screening.  
7.4. Prior and Concomitant Medication s and Procedures  
Prior and concomitant medications and procedures will be reviewed to determine subject 
eligibility.  All concomitant medications and measures  must be recorded in the e CRF , and a ny 
medication received  or procedure performed within [ADDRESS_197441] will be maintained  after  signing the 
ICF to document concomitant medications , including any changes to the dose or regimen.  
Concomitant medications include any prescription, over-the-counter, or natural/herbal preparations taken or administered during the study period.  Concomitant treatments  and/or 
procedures that are required to manage a subject 's medical condition during the st udy will also be 
recorded in the eCRF.  
7.5. Safety Assessments  
7.5.1. Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be monitored from the time the subject  signs the ICF .  Subjects will be 
instructed to report all AEs during the study and will be assessed for the occurrence of AE s 
throughout the study.  In order to avoid bias in eliciting AEs, subjects will be asked general, 
Incyte Corporation  Page 46 of 83 
Protocol INCB [ZIP_CODE]- 202 Am 7 Version 7  02 APR  2020  
CONFIDENTIAL  nonleading questions such as "How are you feeling? "  All AEs (serious and nonserious) must be 
recorded on the source documents and e CRFs  regardless of the ass umption of a causal 
relationship with the study drug .  The definition, reporting, and recording requirements for AEs 
are described in  Section  8. 
7.5.2. Physical Examinations 
Clinically notable abnormalities that are considered clinically significant in the judgment of the 
investigator are to be reported as AEs.  
Physical examinations must be performed by a medically qualified individual such as a licensed 
physician, physician 's assistant, or an advanced registered nurse p ractitioner, as local law 
permits.  
Clinically notable abnormalities that are considered clinically significan t in the judgement of the 
investigator are to be reported as AEs.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Comprehensive Physical  Examination 
The comprehensive physical examination will in clude height (at screening) and body weight and 
assessment(s)  of the following organ or body systems:  skin; head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat; 
thyroid; lungs; cardiovascular system ; abdomen (liver, spleen) ; extremities ; and lymph nodes, as 
well as  a brief neurological exam ination . 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Targeted Physical  Examination 
The targeted physical examination will be a symptom- directed evaluation.  The targeted physical 
examination will include body weight and assessment(s)  of the body systems or organs, as 
indicated by [CONTACT_106216], AEs, or other findings.   
7.5.3. Vital Signs  
Vital sign measurements include blood pressure, pulse, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and body temperature.  
Blood pressure and pulse will be taken with the subject in the recumbent, semirecumbent, or 
sitting position after approximately [ADDRESS_197442] from 
the study based on an ECG flagged as " Abnormal, Clinically Significant " is the responsibility of 
the investigator, in consultation with the sponsor' s medical monitor, as appropriate.  C linically 
notable abnormalities that are considered clinically significant in the judgment of the investigator 
are to be reported as AEs. 
Incyte Corporation  Page [ADDRESS_197443] at 
screening, once every 3 cycles (± 14 days, starting at Cycle 3), at EOT, and as clinically 
indicated.  The eye examination should include a visual acuity test, slit- lamp examination, 
funduscopy with digital imaging, and OCT.  Every effort should be made to ensure that all subsequent examinations are performed by [CONTACT_169105] . 
7.5.6. Laboratory Assessments 
Each site 's local laboratory will be used for eligibility and ongoing safety assessments.  
Chemistry, hematology, coagulation panel, lipid panel, serology, endocrine function, and urinalysis will all be analyzed by [CONTACT_25733] 's laboratory. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pregnancy Testing  
A serum pregnancy test will be required for all women  of childbearing potential during 
screening .  A urine pregnancy test is allowed on Day 1 (before the first dose of study drug), 
Day [ADDRESS_197444] was positive , then t he investigator will 
assess the potential benefit/risk to the subject and  determine whether  it is in the subject 's best 
interest to resume study drug and continue participation in the study. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Hepatitis Screening Tests  
Subjects will undergo screening for hepatitis B or C through their local laboratory.  If the results 
are positive, then subjects will be required to undergo additional testing.  Subjects with chronic 
or cleared hepatitis B or C will be allowed to enroll.  Chronic is defined as subjects with no 
evidence of liver cirrhosis or active hepatitis (elevation of transaminases) but with positive anti-HCV a ntibody test or positive HCV RNA, positive HBV surface antigen , or positive HBV 
DNA.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. HIV Screening Tests  
Subjects outside of the US will be required to submit to an HIV test during screening to ensure negative HIV status before enrollment/Cycle [ADDRESS_197445] is optional for US subjects.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Evaluation of FGF and FGFR Genetic Alterations 
All potential subjects must be evaluated for FGF/FGFR alteration status before  enrollment.  
Subject eligibility can be based on local genomic testing results, if available .  Confirmatory 
testing through the central genomics laboratory will be performed on all subjects.  See  Appendix D  for a list of alterations.  
Incyte Corporation  Page [ADDRESS_197446] v1.1 ( Eisenhauer  et al 2009) will be used, and the recommended method for 
measuring and following tumor burden will be CT scan, to include the thorax, abdomen, and 
pelvis; the neck can be included if needed.  Alternative modalities (eg, MRI) may be substituted 
for a CT scan at the discretion of the investigator, provided that the same modality is used throughout the study and that the m ethodolo gy is consistent with RECIST v1.1. 
The schedule for efficacy assessments will be at screening (this will be considered the baseline scan) , every 2 cycles (every 6 we eks) for the first 4 cycles , every 3 cycles  (every 9  weeks) 
thereafter , and then at EOT  (if applicable) .  For subjects who discontinue treatment for reasons 
other than disease progression, every effort should be made to continue monitoring their disease status by [CONTACT_169106] 1) start of new anticancer therapy, 2) documented disease 
progression, 3) death, or 4) end of study, whichever occurs first. 
7.6.2. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status  
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group perform ance status ( Table 8) will be assessed at the visits 
specified in the schedule of assessments ( Table 5 ).

CONFIDENTIAL  (if discontinued treatment for a reason other than progression), and OS in the e CRF.  For subjects 
who do not intend to return to the study investigator for their ongoing care, follow-up should be 
maintained by [CONTACT_169107], patient  records, and public records/databases at intervals of no 
longer than 12 weeks.  After the final primary analysis is performed, the follow -up interval for 
subsequent anticancer  treatments and survival may  be reduced to every 12 weeks (see 
Section 6.4).  
7.7. Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
7.7.1. Blood Sample Collection  
Pharmacokinetic samples will be obtained on Cycle 1, Day 8 at predose, 1  to 2 hours postdose, 
and 4 to 12 hours postdose (3 samples total; Table 6 ).  The exact date and time of the PK blood 
draws will be recorded in the eCRF along with the date and time of the last dose of study drug preceding the blood draw and the time of the most recent meal.  Instructions for sample 
preparation and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_169079].  
The subject will re ceive a reminder card in advance of the study visit, providing instruction to 
hold the dose of study drug on the day of the visit, a place to record the time of the previous dose 
of study drug, and a place to record the time of the most recent meal or snack consumed. 
On Cycle [ADDRESS_197447] takes the study drug, any subsequent timed samples will be taken.

CONFIDENTIAL  8. SAFETY MONITORING AND REPORTING  
8.1. Adverse Events  
8.1.1. Definitions  
For the purposes of this Protocol, an adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical 
occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related, 
that occurs after a subject provides informed consent.  Abnormal laboratory values or test results occurring after informed consent constitute AEs only if they induce clinical signs or symptoms, 
are considered clinically meaningful, require therapy (eg, hematologic abnormality that requires transfusion), or require changes in the study drug(s). 
8.1.2. Reporting  
Adverse events  that begin or worsen after informed consent should be recorded on the Adverse 
Events form  of the e CRF.  Conditions that were already present at the time of infor med consent 
should be recorded on the Medical History form in  the eCRF.  Monitoring for the occurrence of 
new AEs should be continued for at least [ADDRESS_197448] dose of study drug.   Adverse 
events ( including lab oratory abnormalities that constitute AEs) should be described usin g a 
diagnosis whenever possible rather than  by [CONTACT_147108].  When a 
clear diagnosis cannot be identified, each sign or symptom should be reported as a separate AE . 
The term "disease progression " should be recorded as an AE/SAE only if there are no other 
identifiable AEs /SAEs  associat ed with the disease progression at the time of reporting.  For 
events associated with disease progression , the relevant signs and symptoms should be reported 
using a diagnosis whenever possible rather than individual underlying signs and symptoms.  

Incyte Corporation  Page 51 of 83 
Protocol INCB [ZIP_CODE]- 202 Am 7 Version 7  02 APR  2020  
CONFIDENTIAL  When a clear diagnosis cannot be identified, each sign or symptom should be reported as a 
separate AE.  If the events resulting from disease progression meet the criteria for an SAE (eg, 
resulted in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], a life -threatening event, or death ), the specific event(s) should be  
reported as an SAE(s) as described in Section  8.3.2.  In both cases (ie, AEs or SAEs related to 
disease progression), it should be indicated that each event  (reported as a diagnosis or as signs 
and symptoms) is  related to disease progression  on the Adverse Events form of the eCRF. 
The severity of AEs will be assessed using CTCAE v 4.03 Grades 1 through 4.  T he CTCAE 
v4.03 severity of Grade 5 will not be used; AEs resulting in death  will be gra ded accordingly 
using Grades [ADDRESS_197449] the outcome noted as fatal.   If an event is not classified by 
[CONTACT_3989], the severity  of the AE will be graded according to the scale below to estimate the grade 
of severity:  
Grade  1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated.  
Grade 2  Moderate; minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate activities of daily living.  
Grade 3  Severe or medical ly significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12342]; disabling; limiting self -care activities of 
daily living . 
Grade 4  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated. 
Note that a grading scale for hyperphosphatemia (elevated serum phosphate) is not included in  
CTCAE v 4.03.  Grading should be applied using the table above (" investigations -other, specify" 
category in CTCAE v 4.03).  Hyperphosphatemia should be graded based on clinical severity 
(eg, sympt oms) and medical intervention measures taken (eg , phosphate binders) and not on 
phosphate levels. 
The occurrence of AEs should be sought by [CONTACT_165935].  A dverse events may 
also be detected when they are volunteered by [CONTACT_165936], or through physical examination, laboratory test, or other assessments.  To the 
extent  possible, each AE  should be evaluated to determine: 
• The severity grade (CTCAE Grade 1 to  4). 
• Whether there is at least a reasonable possibility that the AE is related to the study treatment:  suspected (yes) or not suspected (no). 
• The s tart and end dates, unless unresolved at final follo w-up. 
• The action taken with re gard to study drug . 
• The event o utcome ( eg, not recovered/not resolved, recovered/resolved, 
recovering/resolving, recovered/resolved with sequelae, fatal, unknown). 
• The s erious ness, as per serious adverse event (SAE ) definition  provided in 
Section  8.3.1. 
Unlike routine safety assessments, SAEs are monitored continuously and have special reporting requirements  (see Section  8.3.2). 
Incyte Corporation  Page 52 of 83 
Protocol INCB [ZIP_CODE]- 202 Am 7 Version 7  02 APR  2020  
CONFIDENTIAL  All AEs should be treated appropriately.  If an AE is treated with a concomitant medication or 
nondrug therapy, this action should be recorded on A dverse Event form and the treatment should 
be specified on  the Prior/ Concomitant M edications  or Procedures and Non- Drug T herapy form 
in the eCRF . 
Once an AE is detected, it should be followed until it ha s resolved  or until it is judged to be 
permanent;  assessment should be made at  each visit (or more frequently if necessary) of any 
changes in severity, the suspected relation ship to the study drug, the interventions required to 
treat the event , and the outcome. 
When the severity  of an AE changes over time for a reporting period (eg, between visits ), each 
change in severity  will be reported as a separate AE until the event resolves.  For example, 
[ADDRESS_197450] Abnormalities  
Laboratory abnormalities that constitute an AE in their own right (considered clinically 
meaningful, induce clinical signs or symptoms, require concomitant therapy , or require changes 
in study drug ) should be recorded on the Adverse Event form in  the eCRF.  Whenever possible, a 
diagnosis rather than a symptom should be provided (eg, " anemia" instead of " low hem oglobin" ).  
Laboratory abnormalities that meet the criteria for AEs should be followed until they have 
returned to normal or an adequate explanation of the abnormality is found.  When an abnormal 
laboratory te st result corresponds to a sign or symptom of a previously reported AE, it is not 
necessary to separately record the laboratory  test result as an additional event.  
Laboratory abnormalities  that do not meet the definition of an AE  should not be reported as AEs .  
A Grade 3 or 4 (severe) AE does not autom atically indicate an SAE unless it meets the definition  
of serious, as defined in  Section  8.3.1.  A dose modification  for the lab oratory  abnormality may 
be required (see  Section  5.4) and should not contribute to the designation of a laboratory test  
abnormality as an SAE . 
8.3. Serious Adverse Events  
8.3.1. Definitions  
An SAE is defined as an event that meets at least 1 of the following criteria: 
• Is fatal or life -threatening . 
• Requires  inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], unless 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2138] a result of: 
− A routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication not associated with 
any deterioration in condition.   
Incyte Corporation  Page 53 of 83 
Protocol INCB [ZIP_CODE]- 202 Am 7 Version 7  02 APR  2020  
CONFIDENTIAL  − An elective surgery or preplanned treatment for a pre- existing condition that is 
unrelated to the indication under study and has not worsened since signing the 
ICF. 
− A treatment on an emergency outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the definitions of a SAE and not resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]. 
− Any social reasons and respi[INVESTIGATOR_4594], in the absence of any deterioration in the 
subject 's general condition. 
• Results in persistent or significant disability , incapacity , or a substantial disruption of 
a person 's ability to conduct normal life functions . 
• Constitutes a congenital anomaly or birth defect . 
• Is considered to be an important medical event  or a medically significant event that 
may not result in death, be immediately life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_147065], based on appropriate medical judgment, the event 
may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
1 of the outcomes listed above. 
8.3.2. Reporting  
Every SAE, regardless of suspected causality (eg, relatio nship to study drug(s) or study 
procedure or disease progression), occurring after the subject has signed the ICF through the last 
study visit (or [ADDRESS_197451] dose of study drug, whichever is later) must be reported to 
the sponsor (or designee) within [ADDRESS_197452] a reasonable possibility that the SAE is related to the study treatment:  suspected  
(yes) or not suspected (no).  Refer to the Incyte Reference Guide for Completing the Serious 
Adverse Event Report Form. 
The contact [CONTACT_89208]' s study- specific representatives  is listed in the 
investigator manual provided to each site.  The original copy of the SAE Report Form and the 
confirmation sheet must be kept at the study site.  
Investigational site personnel must report any new inform ation regarding the SAE within 
24 hours of becoming aware of the information in the same manner that the initial SAE Report 
Form was sent.  Follow-up information is recorded on an amended or new SAE Report Form, 
with an indication that it is follow -up to the previously reported SAE and the date of the original 
report.  The follow-up report should include information that was not provided on the previous 
Incyte Corporation  Page 54 of 83 
Protocol INCB [ZIP_CODE]- 202 Am 7 Version 7  02 APR  2020  
CONFIDENTIAL  SAE Report Form, such as the outcome of the event (eg, resolved or ongoing), treatment 
provided, action taken with study drug because of the SAE (eg, dose reduced, interrupted, or 
discontinued), or subject disposition (eg, continued or withdrew from study participation).  Each recurrence, complication, or progression of the original event should be reported as follow-up to that event, regardless of when it occurs. 
If the SAE is not documented in the IB for the study drug  (new occurrence) and is thought to be 
related to the sponsor' s study drug, the sponsor or its designee may urgently requir e further 
information from the investigator for reporting to health authorities .  The sponsor or its designee 
may need to issue an  Investigator Notification (IN)  to inform all investigators involved in any 
study with the same drug that this SAE has been reported.  Suspected Unexpected Serious 
Adverse Reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) will be collected and reported to the competent authorities and 
relevant ethics committees in accordance with Directive 2001/20/EC , or as per national 
regulatory requirements in participating countries. 
8.4. Emergency Unblinding of Treatment Assignment  
Not applicable. 
8.5. Pregnanc y 
Pregnancy, in and of itself, is not regarded as an AE unless there is suspi[INVESTIGATOR_147066] a contraceptive medication or method.  When a pregnancy has been confirmed in a subject during maternal or paternal exposure to study drug, 
the following procedures should be follow ed in order to ensure subject safety: 
• The s tudy drug must be discontinued immediately  (female subjects only ; see 
Section  5.4.2 for the maximum permitted dura tion of study drug interruption). 
• The i nvestigator must complete and submit the Incyte Clinical Trial Pregnancy  form 
to the sponsor or its designee within 24 hours  of learning of t he pregnancy. 
Data on fetal outcome and breastfeeding are collected for regulatory reporting and drug safety 
evaluation.  Follow-up should be conducted for each pregnancy to determine outcome, including 
spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of the birth, and the presence or absence of any 
birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn complications, by [CONTACT_147109]- baby [CONTACT_765].  Pregnancy should be recorded on a Clinical Trial Pregnancy f orm 
and reported by [CONTACT_89211].  Pregnancy follow-up information

complaint should be reported as described in Section  8.1.[ADDRESS_197453] for investigation, he/she will return a copy of the 
product complaint communication  with the product. 
9. STATISTICS  
9.1. Study Population s 
The efficacy evaluable population includes all subjects who have a known FGF/FGFR alteration from the central genomics laboratory and received at least [ADDRESS_197454] a negative FGF/FGFR alteration from the central genomics laboratory and 
received at least 1  dose of study drug. 
The per protocol (PP) population includes all efficacy  subjects who were sufficiently compliant 
with the Protocol. 
The safety population includes all subjects who received  at least 1 dose of study drug. 
9.2. Selection of Sample Size  
Approximately 100 subjects with documentation of FGFR2 translocation from the central genomics laboratory are planned for the final analysis  of the primary endpoint of ORR.  With the 
assumed rates of 33% for the intervention, a sample size of approximately 100 subjects would 
provide > 95% probability to have a 95% c onfidence interval with lower limit of >  15% 
Incyte Corporation  Page 56 of 83 
Protocol INCB [ZIP_CODE]- 202 Am 7 Version 7  02 APR  2020  
CONFIDENTIAL  assuming 10% lost to follow-up.  Up to 20 subjects will be enrolled in Cohorts B and C (US 
only), respectively, which will provide > 80% chance of observing at least 4 responders in each 
cohort if the underlying ORR is 30%. 
9.3. Level of Significance  
The level of significance for the primary endpoint is 1-sided 5%. 
9.4. Statistical Analyses  
Subjects will be summarized by [CONTACT_32024] , and cohort determination will be based on FGF/FGFR 
status from the central genomics laboratory. 
9.4.1. Efficacy Analyses 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Primary Efficacy Analyses  
The primary endpoint of the study is ORR in subjects with FGFR2 translocations  based on the 
central genomics laboratory results , defined as the proportion of subjects who achieved a CR or a 
PR based on RECIST v 1.[ADDRESS_197455] sufficient baseline or on -study response assessment information to be adequately assessed  
for response status will be included in the denominators in the calculation of ORR .  The 95% CI 
for the ORR will be estimated using the Clopper -Pearson method. 
The ORR will also be analyzed based on per  protocol population as sensitivity analysis. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Seconda ry Efficacy Analyses 
Secondary efficacy analysis will be conducted for the efficacy evaluable population.  
Objective response rate in subjects with FGF/FGFR alterations other than FGFR2 translocations, 
in subjects negative for FGF/FGFR alteration  and in al l subjects with FGF/FGFR alterations  will 
be analyzed in the same fashion as the primary analysis.  
For objective responders, DOR is defined as the time from the date that a subject first achieves  
CR or PR based on RECIST v1.[ADDRESS_197456] date known to be alive.  Overall survival will be analyzed by [CONTACT_8761] -Meier  method. 
  
 
 
 
 
 
9.4.2. Safety Analyses 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Events  
A TEAE is any  AE either reported for the first time or worsening of a pre- existing event after 
first dose of study drug.  Analysis of AEs will be limited to TEAEs, but data listings will include all AEs regardless of their timing to study drug administration.  Adverse events will be tabulated 
by [CONTACT_169108].  Severity of AEs will be based on the 
National Cancer Institute ( NCI) CTCAE v4.03 using Grades 1 through 4 ( NCI 2010 ). 
The subset of AEs considered by [CONTACT_8127] a relationship to study drug will be considered to be treatment- related AEs.  If the investigator does not specify  the relationship of 
the AE to study drug, the AE will be considered treatment- related.  The incidence of AEs and 
treatment -related AEs will be tabulated.  
Subjects taking INCB054828 may develop HP , which is a known effect of selective FGFR 
inhibitors.  The number and percentage of subjects with at least 1 event of HP will be tabulated.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Clinical Laboratory Tests 
Laboratory test values outside the normal range will be assessed for severity based on the normal ranges for the clinical reference laboratory.  The incidence of abnormal laboratory values and 
shift tables relative  to baseline will be tabulated.  
Laboratory data will be classified into Grades 1 through 4 using CTCAE v4.03.  The following 
summaries will be produced for the laboratory data:  
• Number and percentage of subjects with worst postbaseline CTC AE grade (regardless 
of baseline value).  Each subject will be counted only for the worst grade observed postbaseline. 
• Shift tables from  baseline to the worst postbaseline value using CTC AE grade.  
• For laboratory parameters where CTC AE grades are not defined, shift tables to the 
worst postbaseline value using the low/normal/hig h classifications based on 
laboratory reference ranges.

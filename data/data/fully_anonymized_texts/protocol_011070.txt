INTRODUCTION
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of irreversible vision loss in 
developed countries. AMD is characterized by [CONTACT_375034], known as drusen, 
accumulating between the retinal pi[INVESTIGATOR_374999]’s membrane. In exudative or wet AMD unwanted blood vessels grow into the macula which leads to hemorrhage and subretinal fluid. In addition, retinal pi[INVESTIGATOR_6678], retinal tears, fibrovascular scarring and vitreous hemorrhage may occur. The aberrant growth of leaky vessels is the result of local inflammatory responses leading to disruption of the balance of cytokines that control angiogenesis 
(Lim et al., 2008)
Angiogenesis is a complex and coordinated process of the growth and sprouting of new blood 
vessels from pre-existing vasculature. Although several angiogenic factors have been identified, VEGF family proteins, their receptors and intracellular signaling molecules appear to be the key mediators of angiogenesis (Kane et al., 2008) .
Approximately 1.[ADDRESS_469427] geographic atrophy; >[ADDRESS_469428] bilateral large drusen. These prevalence figures are expected to increase by [CONTACT_3450] 50% ( Chew et al, 2012; Friedman et al, 2004 ). From the initial stage of dry AMD, 
characterized by [CONTACT_375035], 10% are at risk for severe, acute loss of central vision due to the onset of wet AMD, characterized by [CONTACT_375036], which leads to subretinal bleeding, fluid exudation, and fibrotic scar 
formation. Over 200,000 new patients each year in the U.S. develop wet AMD ( Ferris, et al, 1984 ).
Current FDA-approved therapi[INVESTIGATOR_375000] (Macugen
®), ranibizumab (Lucentis®) 
and aflibercept (Eylea®). All of these molecules act against the same target: vascular endothelial 
growth factor (VEGF). VEGF, a potent endothelial cell mitogen and vascular permeability factor, is a major contributor to the pathogenesis of neovascular AMD. Treatments with anti-VEGF drugs, 
which are delivered by [CONTACT_375037], have shown dramatic visual benefits for 
AMD patients ( Brown et al, 2006; Heier et al, 2012; Martin et al, 2012 ). However, there are some 
critical limitations; in formal clinical trials, despi[INVESTIGATOR_375001], 23% of eyes treated monthly with ranibizumab proceeded to vision worse than 20/200, and 20% to 40% fail to resolve macular fluid even after 2 years of therapy ( Brown et al, 2006; Heier et al, 2 012). 
Furthermore, in the “real-world” setting, patients receive intravitreal injections at much lower 
frequency than the established protocols, so that on average, long-term visual outcomes in AMD 
treatment are poor ( Rofagha et al, 2013; Maguire et al, 2016 ). Factors associated with poor vision 
outcomes, in addition to persistent exudation, include macular atrophy and submacular fibrotic scar formation. Thus, there is a need for additive or alternative therapy to anti-VEGF treatments for wet AMD.
Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) has been implicated in the pathophysiology of both angiogenesis 
and fibrosis in retinal diseases ( Schultz and Grant, 1991; Vinding, 1990 ). FGF comprises a family 
of 22 members, including FGF2, having many biological activities ( Bikfalvi et al., 1997 ). FGF2 
promotes growth of vascular endothelial cells and tubular structure formation ( Strutz et al, 2002 ), 
and stimulates both VEGF production and scar formation in retina. 
RBM-007 injectable solution is a novel oligonucleotide-based aptamer having potent anti-FGF2 
activity ( Jin et al, 2016 ) and anti-VEGF-expression activity ( Belgore et al, 2003 ). In the rat and  
RBM-007 Injectable Solution Protocol RBM-007-002 Amendment 1   
 1 7  o f  7 8              Confidential  mouse models of laser-induced choroidal neovascularization, it showed activity after intravitreal 
injection at doses as low as 5 μg/eye ( Matsuda et al., 2019 ). In the laser-induced choroidal 
neovascularization (CNV) fibrosis model in rats, it showed activity after intravitreal injection at 
doses as low as 15 μg/eye ( Matsuda et al., 2019 ). It is hypothesized to have potential effects in the 
treatment of wet AMD because of these activities. Thus, the Sponsor plans to evaluate the safety and bioactivity of RBM-007 Injectable Solution as an intravitreal treatment for exudative AMD.
RIBOMIC has conducted a Phase I/II, open-label, dose-escalating, sequential cohort study 
assessing the safety, tolerability and bioactivity of a single IVT injection of RBM-007 injectable solution in the study eye of nine subjects with refractory wet AMD (Protocol RBM-007-001). 
Three dose levels of RBM-[ADDRESS_469429] been assessed in this Phase I/II study, 0.2 mg/eye, 1.0 mg/eye 
and 2.0 mg/eye. In this study (SUSHI), there were no reported SAEs. No dose-dependent events were reported and no safety concerns were identified at all investigated doses. Ocular AEs were reported in 3 subjects (33.3%). Most common AE was subconjunctival hemorrhage (2 subjects) and these were considered to be due to the injection procedure. Only one drug related AE was mild iritis that was resolved after one day of topi[INVESTIGATOR_375002].
RIBOMIC believes that the Phase I/II study results mentioned above, in addition to the results of 
the non-clinical studies, support the use of repeated IVT injections of the 2.0 mg concentrations of RBM-007 in humans in the Phase II clinical trial, namely TOFU (Protocol RBM-007-002).

RBM-007 injections in combination with Eylea® dosed at every other month, compared to 
Eylea® monotherapy dosed at every other month in approximately eighty -one subjects with

RBM-007 Injectable Solution Protocol RBM-007-002 Amendment 1   
 2 1  o f  7 8              Confidential  A wide range of animal toxicology studies were conducted with RBM-007 Injectable Solution by 
[CONTACT_375039]. Systemic toxicity was seen only with high doses far above those 
doses contemplated for ocular administration. The NOAEL in Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) intravitreal monkey studies is 1 mg/eye. Using a volume of vitreous of 2.2 mL for monkey, this is 
a concentration of 0.45 mg/mL ( Atsumi et al, 2013 ). The intended human doses for the first in 
human study (RBM-007-001) are 1.0 mg and 2.0 mg per eye administered once. Considering a 
value of human vitreous to be 5.2 mL ( Panda-Jonas, 1994 ), these concentrations are 0.038, 0.19 
and 0.38 mg/mL for these clinical doses. Therefore, the NOAEL in monkey is 11-fold higher than the intended starting clinical dose and 1.1-fold higher than intended maximum human dose. The safety factor would have been even higher if the viscosity and injectable volume for RBM-007 
Injectable Solution in animals (monkey and rabbit) were not limiting parameters. Additionally, the 
current long-term ocular monkey study with monthly injection of RBM-007 at 1 mg/eye monotherapy and RBM-007 at 0.5 or 1 mg/eye in addition to Eylea
® at 2 mg/eye for up to five 
injections (by [CONTACT_10585] 20 of dosing as interim report) has not shown any treatment-related adverse effect. This study is still ongoing.
With regard to systemic exposure, the highest concentration of RBM-007 seen in plasma after 
single intravitreal dosing was 2,100 ng/mL at a dose of 1 mg/eye in monkey and 65.1 ng/mL at a dose of 0.5 mg/eye (injection to both eyes at a dose of 0.5 mg/eye, total 1 mg/body) in rabbit. Toxicokinetic evaluation in GLP systemic studies in monkey suggests that blood level at which toxicity might occur is 691,000 ng/mL. Thus, even without correcting for the body weight differences between animals and humans, the safety margin is 165–5,207 at the maximum dose of 
2.0 mg/eye for human. If the body weight for animals is taken into account (rabbit and monkey at 
3 kg and human at 70 kg.), the safety margin is 3,850–123,830. 
Thus, the Sponsor contends that the preclinical toxicology studies support the planned clinical 
studies.
Number of Subjects
Approximately 81 subjects (Arm 1: 27 subjects, Arm 2: 27 subjects, Arm 3: 27 subjects) with wet AMD will be enrolled at approximately 15 sites. The final number of subjects enrolled may be adjusted based on drop-out rate.

Prior to RBM-007 administration, the study eye should be prepared as follows:
1.Dilate pupil (1 % mydriacyl and 2.5 % phenylephrine or equivalent applied topi[INVESTIGATOR_897]) 
approximately 10 minutes prior to injection.
2.Administer 1 eye drop of topi[INVESTIGATOR_15413] (0.5 % proparacaine hydrochloride ophthalmic 
solution or an equivalent topi[INVESTIGATOR_163011]).
3.Administer 10 % povidone iodine.
4.Use a sterile cotton-tipped applicator to remove excess fluid from the lower conjunctival sac.
5.Take 2 sterile cotton tipped applicators and thoroughly soak with 0.5 % proparacaine topi[INVESTIGATOR_375008]. Place the soaked 
applicators, side by [CONTACT_10167], gently but firmly on the conjunctival surface at the area of the

7. Patch the study eye at the Clinical Investigator's discretion.
8. Prescribe topi[INVESTIGATOR_375009].
<Investigational drug: Sham>
Sham is injection that simulates RBM-007/Eylea® drug administration. Sham intravitreal 
injections will be administered to subjects according to the same dosing schedule and procedure 
as RBM-007/ Eylea® injections. However the Sham intravitreal injection procedure will only 
mimic RBM-007/Eylea® intravitreal injection in that the blunt end of an empty syringe is pressed 
against an anesthetized eye, instead of a needle attached to RBM-007/Eylea® syringe injected into 
the anesthetized eye. Therefore Step 3 and 4 of RBM-007 ( Section 10.7 ) and corresponding steps 
of Eylea® administration procedure will be skipped for the Sham injection.
To keep masking of the study, investigator and authorized staff must follow the points described 
in Section 9.4.

The used vials of RBM-007/ Eylea® will be stored at the investigational site upon completion of 
accountability procedures and returned to RIBOMIC or designee after the trial is completed.
Refer to Study Drug Manual for study drug handling. 
RBM-[ADDRESS_469452] Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA)
Mean change in BCVA from Baseline at Week 16 is the primary efficacy variable for this study, 
Proportion of subjects with BCVA: 1) gain of ≥15 ETDRS letters (3-line gainers); 2) gain of ≥10 
ETDRS letters; 3 )  gain of ≥ 5 ETDRS letters and 4) ≥ [ADDRESS_469453] could not read ETDRS chart, Finger Counts, Hand 
Motion, Light Perception, or No Light Perception will be recorded.
Central Subfield Thickness (CST), Macular Volume (MV), Fibrosis and SHRM
CST, MV , fibrosis and SHRM are secondary efficacy variables, and change in CST, MV, fibrosis and SHRM from Baseline at Week [ADDRESS_469454] a causal relationship with the study drug(s). An AE, therefore, can be an unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease that 
has clinical significance and is temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) 
product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.
In clinical studies, an undesirable medical condition occurring at any time, including Baseline or 
pre-treatment period, may be recorded as an AE even if no study drug has been administered.
Any significant adverse change in a subject’s condition from Baseline, regardless of causality, is 
to be considered an AE, unless the change is determined to be a continuation of a pre-existing 
condition that is documented in the subject’s medical history. However, a clinically significant 
worsening in severity, intensity, or frequency of a pre-existing condition may indicate an AE. In addition, all conditions that lead to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], defined as an overnight hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], are considered as AEs. This includes planned elective surgeries.
Lack of efficacy of the study drug(s) for the condition being investigated is not considered an AE 
unless a clinically significant change is assessed by [CONTACT_120666].  An elective surgical 
procedure scheduled or planned prior to study entry is not considered an AE if an overnight hospi[INVESTIGATOR_375013], and the underlying diagnosis for which surgery is to be performed 
should be captured in the medical history as a pre-existing condition. The surgical procedure 
should also include the term “elective” in all reports.
Assessment of Adverse Events
Clinical Investigators will seek information on AEs at each subject contact. Subjects should be 
asked, using a general, non-direct question, if there has been any change in their general health. 
Direct questioning and examination should then be performed as appropriate.
Severity of the AE should be assessed according to the following criteria:
•Mild: No interference with the subject’s daily activities; no medical intervention/therapy
required
•Moderate: Possible interference with the subject’s daily activit ies; no or minimal medical
intervention/therapy required
•Severe: Considerable interference with the subj ect’s daily activities; medical 
intervention/therapy required
Regardless of severity, some AEs may also meet regulatory serious criteria. Refer to definitions 
and reporting of serious adverse events (SAEs) in Section 12.1.2.
A Clinical Investigator who is qualified in medicine must make the determination of the 
relationship of the study drug(s) to each AE (related or not related). The Clinical Investigator 
should decide whether, in his or her medical judgment, there is a reasonable possibility that the

 4 6  o f  7 8              Confidential  RBM-007, Eylea® or the Sham injection could have caused the AE/SAE based on facts, evidence, 
scientific rationales, and clinical judgment. When assessing causality, the Clinical Investigator 
may consider the following information when determining the relationship to the study drug(s) for each AE: mechanism of action, biologic plausibility, confounding risk factors (i.e., medical history, 
concomitant medications), temporal relationship, dechallenge/rechallenge, and lack of alternative 
explanation. It should be specified if the AE is related to the injection procedure and not the study drug.
xThe AE may be recorded as Related to the study drug(s) if there is a plausible temporal 
relationship between the onset of the AE and administration of the study drug(s), and the AE 
cannot be readily explained by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state, concurrent illness, or concomitant 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; and/or the AE follows a known pattern of response to the study drug(s),; and/or the AE abates or resolves upon discontinuation of the study drug(s),.
xReporting the AE as Not Related to study drug(s), may be considered if, for example, there 
is good evidence that the AE has an etiology other than the study drug(s) (e.g., pre-existing medical condition, underlying disease, concurrent illness, or concomitant medication); 
and/or the AE has no plausible temporal relationship to administration of the study drug(s) 
(e.g., cancer diagnosed 2 days after dose of study drug(s)).
Reporting Adverse Events
AEs, whether spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_150041], will 
be recorded in the subject’s medical record and on the appropriate AE eCRF. Each recorded AE 
will be described by [CONTACT_13662] (i.e., start and end dates), frequency, severity, regulatory seriousness criteria if applicable, suspected relationship to the study drug(s), relation to injection procedure, location, actions taken and outcome.
AEs that occur after any subject has provided written informed consent, before treatment, during 
treatment, or within [ADDRESS_469455] be recorded. To improve the quality and precision of acquired AE data, Clinical 
Investigators should observe the following guidelines:
xWhenever possible, use recognized medical terms when recording. Do not use colloquialisms and/or abbreviations.
xIf known, record the diagnosis (i.e., disease or syndrome) rather than component signs and 
symptoms and /or laboratory or test findings (e.g., record congestive heart failure rather than 
dyspnea, rales, and cyanosis, and enlarged heart on chest x-ray). However, other events that are considered unrelated to an encountered syndrome or disease should be recorded as individual AEs (e.g., if congestive heart failure and severe headache are observed at the same time and are clinically unrelated, each event should be recorded as an individual AE).
xIf the diagnosis is not known, then record the leading component sign, symptom or test finding and describe the other clinically related findings in the narrative description of the case. A suspected diagnosis can be used and described as such
x(e.g., record suspected or probable myocardial infarction); this has to be updated in the clinical database once the diagnosis is confirmed.

 4 7  o f  7 8              Confidential  xAEs occurring secondary to other events (e.g., sequelae) should be identified by [CONTACT_163031]. A primary AE, if clearly identifiable, generally represents the most accurate clinical term. If a primary AE is recorded, events occurring secondary to the primary event should be described in the narrative description of the case. For example:
xThe subject developed orthostatic hypotension and subsequently fainted and fell to the floor wherein she experienced a head trauma and neck pain.
xThe primary AE in this example is orthostatic hypotension. The fall, head trauma and neck 
pain should be described in the narrative description of the case.
xFor intermittent events (e.g., intermittent headache), the event onset date should be recorded 
as the date the subject first started to experience the event and resolution date should reflect when the last occurrence resolved or stopped. Separate AEs for each event should not be recorded. For example, if a subject experienced headache on 14SEP2015 lasting for three hours, then subsequently experienced intermittent epi[INVESTIGATOR_375014] [ADDRESS_469456] complains of intermittent headaches for one week and the severity of each headache ranges from mild to moderate, then the severity would be moderate.

sclerosis, commonly known for its relapsing and remitting course, in some cases leading to

of the event.
To improve the quality and precision of acquired SAE data, Clinical Investigators should observe 
the following guidelines:
x Death - Death is an outcome of an event. The event that resulted in the death should be 
recorded and reported as a SAE.
x Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_163016] - The illness leading to the 
surgical or diagnostic procedure should be recorded as the SAE, not the procedure itself. The 
procedure should be captured in the case narrative as part of the action taken in response to 
the illness.
When new significant information (including the outcome of the event) is obtained, the Clinical Investigator should enter the information directly into the eCRF within [ADDRESS_469460].
Expedited Reporting of Serious Adverse Events
RIBOMIC (or designee) will provide the Principal Investigator [CONTACT_4490] a reporting cover letter and an anonymized MedWatch 3500A or CIOMs form as appropriate for expedited reporting of SAEs to the IRB or IEC.

Appendix C - Declaration of Helsinki
  
WMA Declaration of Helsinki - Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human 
Subjects 
 
Preamble
1. The World Medical Association (WMA) has developed the Declaration of Helsinki as a 
statement of ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects, including research 
on identifiable human material and data.
The Declaration is intended to be read as a whole and each of its constituent paragraphs 
should be applied with consideration of all other relevant paragraphs.
2. Consistent with the mandate of the WMA, the Declaration is addressed primarily to 
physicians. The WMA encourages others who are involved in medical research involving human subjects to adopt these principles.
General Principles
3. The Declaration of Geneva of the WMA binds the physician with the words, “The health 
of my patient will be my first consideration,” and the International Code of Medical Ethics 
declares that, “A physician shall act in the patient's best interest when providing medical care.”
4. It is the duty of the physician to promote and safeguard the health, well-being and rights 
of patients, including those who are involved in medical research. The physician's knowledge 
and conscience are dedicated to the fulfilment of this duty.
5. Medical progress is based on research that ultimately must include studies involving 
human subjects.
6. The primary purpose of medical research involving human subjects is to understand the 
causes, development and effects of diseases and improve preventive, diagnostic and therapeutic interventions (methods, procedures and treatments). Even the best proven interventions must be 
evaluated continually through research for their safety, effectiveness, efficiency, accessibility and 
quality.
7. Medical research is subject to ethical standards that promote and ensure respect for all 
human subjects and protect their health and rights.
8. While the primary purpose of medical research is to generate new knowledge, this goal 
can never take precedence over the rights and interests of individual research subjects.
9. It is the duty of physicians who are involved in medical research to protect the life, 
health, dignity, integrity, right to self-determination, privacy, and confidentiality of personal 
information of research subjects. The responsibility for the protection of research subjects must 
always rest with the physician or other health care professionals and never with the research 
subjects, even though they have given consent.
10. Physicians must consider the ethical, legal and regulatory norms and standards for 
research involving human subjects in their own countries as well as applicable international  
RBM-[ADDRESS_469481], incentives for subjects and information regarding provisions for treating and/or compensating 
subjects who are harmed as a consequence of participation in the research study.
In clinical trials, the protocol must also describe appropriate arrangements for post-trial 
provisions.
Research Ethics Committees
23. The research protocol must be submitted for consideration, comment, guidance and 
approval to the concerned research ethics committee before the study begins. This committee 
must be transparent in its functioning, must be independent of the researcher, the sponsor and 
any other undue influence and must be duly qualified. It must take into consideration the laws 
and regulations of the country or countries in which the research is to be performed as well as applicable international norms and standards but these must not be allowed to reduce or eliminate any of the protections for research subjects set forth in this Declaration.
The committee must have the right to monitor ongoing studies. The researcher must 
provide monitoring information to the committee, especially information about any serious adverse events. No amendment to the protocol may be made without consideration and approval 
by [CONTACT_942]. After the end of the study, the researchers must submit a final report to the 
committee containing a summary of the study’s findings and conclusions.
Privacy and Confidentiality 
24. Every precaution must be taken to protect the privacy of research subjects and the 
RBM-[ADDRESS_469482]’s freely-given informed consent, preferably in writing. If the consent cannot be expressed in writing, the non- written consent must be formally documented and witnessed.
All medical research subjects should be given the option of being informed about the 
general outcome and results of the study.
27. When seeking informed consent for participation in a research study the physician must 
be particularly cautious if the potential subject is in a dependent relationship with the physician or may consent under duress. In such situations the informed consent must be sought by [CONTACT_30388].
28. For a potential research subject who is incapable of giving informed consent, the 
physician must seek informed consent from the legally authorized representative. These individuals must not be included in a research study that has no likelihood of benefit for them 
unless it is intended to promote the health of the group represented by [CONTACT_11275], the 
research cannot instead be performed with persons capable of providing informed consent, and 
the research entails only minimal risk and minimal burden.
29. When a potential research subject who is deemed incapable of giving informed consent 
is able to give assent to decisions about participation in research, the physician must seek that 
assent in addition to the consent of the legally authorized representative. The potential subject’s 
dissent should be respected.
30. Research involving subjects who are physically or mentally incapable of giving consent, 
for example, unconscious patients, may be done only if the physical or mental condition that 
prevents giving informed consent is a necessary characteristic of the research group. In such 
circumstances the physician must seek informed consent from the legally authorized representative. If no such representative is available and if the research cannot be delayed, the study may proceed without informed consent provided that the specific reasons for involving subjects with a condition that renders them unable to give informed consent have been stated in the research protocol and the study has been approved by a research ethics committee. Consent 
to remain in the research must be obtained as soon as possible from the subject or a legally 
RBM-[ADDRESS_469483] fully inform the patient which aspects of their care are related to the 
research. The refusal of a patient to participate in a study or the patient’s decision to withdraw 
from the study must never adversely affect the patient-physician relationship.
32. For medical research using identifiable human material or data, such as research on 
material or data contained in biobanks or similar repositories, physicians must seek informed 
consent for its collection, storage and/or reuse. There may be exceptional situations where consent would be impossible or impracticable to obtain for such research. In such situations the research may be done only after consideration and approval of a research ethics committee.
Use of Placebo
33. The benefits, risks, burdens and effectiveness of a new intervention must be tested 
against those of the best proven intervention(s), except in the following circumstances:
Where no proven intervention exists, the use of placebo, or no intervention, is acceptable;
or
Where for compelling and scientifically sound methodological reasons the use of any
intervention less effective than the best proven one, the use of placebo, or no intervention is 
necessary to determine the efficacy or safety of an intervention and the patients who receive any 
intervention less effective than the best proven one, placebo, or no intervention will not be 
subject to additional risks of serious or irreversible harm as a result of not receiving the best 
proven intervention.
Extreme care must be taken to avoid abuse of this option.
Post-Trial Provisions
34. In advance of a clinical trial, sponsors, researchers and host country governments should 
make provisions for post-trial access for all participants who still need an intervention identified 
as beneficial in the trial. This information must also be disclosed to participants during the 
informed consent process.
Research Registration and Publication and Dissemination of Results
35. Every research study involving human subjects must be registered in a publicly 
accessible database before recruitment of the first subject.
36. Researchers, authors, sponsors, editors and publishers all have ethical obligations with 
regard to the publication and dissemination of the results of research. Researchers have a duty to 
make publicly available the results of their research on human subjects and are accountable for the completeness and accuracy of their reports. All parties should adhere to accepted guidelines for ethical reporting. Negative and inconclusive as well as positive results must be published or 
otherwise made publicly available. Sources of funding, institutional affiliations and conflicts of 
interest must be declared in the publication. Reports of research not in accordance with the principles of this Declaration should not be accepted for publication.
Unproven Interventions in Clinical Practice
37. In the treatment of an individual patient, where proven interventions do not exist or 
other known interventions have been ineffective, the physician, after seeking expert advice, with 
RBM-007 Injectable Solution Protocol RBM-007-002   
 7 2  o f  7 8              Confidential  informed consent from the patient or a legally authorized representative, may use an unproven 
intervention if in the physician's judgment it offers hope of saving life, re-establishing health or 
alleviating suffering. This intervention should subsequently be made the object of research, designed to evaluate its safety and efficacy. In all cases, new information must be recorded and, 
where appropriate, made publicly available.

Appendix D - Procedures for Examinations
21.4.1 Demographics/Eligibility, Medical/Surgical History and Concomitant 
Medication
Demographics/Eligibility, medical/surgical history and concomitant medication will be obtained through subject interviews at Screening (Day -28 to Day -1). Medical history and concomitant medications will be obtained through subject interviews at each visit.
 
21.4.2 Physical Examination
A full body systematic physical examination will be conducted during Visit 0/Screening (Day - 28 to Day -1). Clinical Investigator or an external internist will confirm subject’s overall condition noting any abnormalities by a review of the following systems: e.g., head, neck, thyroid, ears, nose, 
throat, mouth, tongue, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], cardiovascular, abdomen, neurological and other. 
The Clinical Investigator will assess subject’s overall condition to determine qualification for 
study entry considering possible class effects of RBM-007. 
21.4.3 Vital Signs
Blood pressure and heart rate will be measured at Visit 0/Screening (Day - 28 to Day -1) using an automated or manual blood pressure monitor. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures will be recorded in millimeters of mercury (mmHg) and heart rate will be recorded in beats per minute (bpm).
In accordance with the recommendations of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, 
Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure 
(US_Dept_Health_and_Human_Services, 2004 ), the following measurement procedure will be 
used to measure vital signs:
xSubject should not smoke or ingest caffeine within the 30-minute period immediately before 
the measurement.
xSubject should be seated quietly in a chair with the back supported, feet on the floor, arm 
bared, and arm supported at heart level.
xBegin the measurement after at least [ADDRESS_469486] 80 % of the arm. Many adults need a large cuff.
xTake two (2) systolic/diastolic pressure and heart rate measurements separated by [CONTACT_2669] [ADDRESS_469487]’s source document.
xIf the two pressure measurements differ by 5 mmHg or less, then the average of the two 
becomes the recorded pressure. For example, if the two measurements are 120/90 and 125/95, then 122.5/92.5 is the recorded systolic/diastolic pressure. 
RBM-[ADDRESS_469488] reading 
measurement is made, and the average of the three becomes the recorded pressure. For 
example, if the three measurements are 115/90, 124/96, and 120/92, then 119.7/92.7 is the recorded systolic/diastolic pressure. The recorded blood pressure will be the average of the 
measurements.
xRecord the heart rate. For heart rate, the average of the two (or three, if performed) 
measurements obtained becomes the recorded heart rate.
21.4.[ADDRESS_469489] will be conducted before IVT injection at Screening Visit, Visit 1 and 
Visit 7 for all females of childbearing potential. A female is considered of childbearing potential 
unless she is postmenopausal (at least [ADDRESS_469490] menses occurred), has had her uterus and/or both ovaries removed, or has had a bilateral tubal ligation. To obtain the pregnancy test, 
the subject should follow instructions provided by [CONTACT_375056].
 
21.4.[ADDRESS_469491] BCVA at each study visit.
21.4.6 External Ocular Examination
External ocular examination will be done evaluating lid and lashes as normal and abnormal with notes if abnormal.
21.4.7 Slit-Lamp Biomicroscopy
Slit-lamp biomicroscopy will be used to examine eye structures at each study visit. Slit-lamp biomicroscopy will be performed prior to the (first) injection and then again within 30 minutes 
after the (second) injection on the Visit 1 (Day1), 3 (W4), 4 (W8) and 5 (W12). This will be also 
applied for the post IVT injection of Rescue treatment. The conjunctiva, cornea, and lens will be observed with the slit-lamp beam approximately 0.3 mm in width and 1.0 mm in length. Conjunctiva, Sclera and Cornea will be described as normal / abnormal with notes if abnormal.
  
Lens 
The lens will be noted as normal/abnormal, phakic, aphakic, or pseudophakic. Phakic lens will be graded for cataract as nuclear, posterior subcapsular, and cortical as described below:
None (0) = No lens discoloration nor opacificationMild (1) = Yellow lens discoloration or small lens opacity (axial or peripheral) 
Moderate (2) = Amber lens discoloration or medium lens opacity (axial or peripheral) 
Severe (3) = Brunescent lens discoloration or complete lens opacification (no red reflex)
Anterior chamber cells and flare will be observed with a 1.0 mm in width and 1.0 mm in length 
slit beam and graded using the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) scale (Sun 
RBM-007 Injectable Solution Protocol RBM-007-002   
 7 5  o f  7 8              Confidential  Working, 2005) . The iris and the pupil will be evaluated for the presence of clinically significant 
abnormalities.
AAnterior Chamber Cells 
 
(0) = No cells 
(0.5) = 1-5 cells(1) = 6-15 cells
(2) = 16-25 cells
(3) = 26-50 cells(4) = >50 cells
 
Anterior Chamber Flare 
(0) = None
(1) = Fain
(2) = Moderate (iris/lens details clear)(3) = Marked (iris/lens details hazy)
(4) = Intense (fibrin/plastic aqueous)
 
Iris 
The iris will be evaluated for the presence of any clinically significant abnormalities, and 
graded as either normal (within normal limits) or abnormal (clinically significant abnormality 
present). A description of any clinically significant abnormalities will be noted.
 
Pupil 
The pupil will be evaluated for the presence of any clinically significant abnormalities, and 
graded as either normal (within normal limits) or abnormal (clinically significant abnormality 
present). A description of any clinically significant abnormalities will be noted.
21.4.8 Intraocular Pressure
IOP will be measured by [CONTACT_375057]. Procedures in each visit are 
described in Section 7.5.2 .
RBM-007 Injectable Solution Protocol RBM-007-002   
 7 6  o f  7 8              Confidential  For Rescue IVT injection, IOP will be measured as follows: 
-IOP will be measured at 40 (±10) minutes post-injection.
-If post-injection IOP is > 21 mmHg after eye massage and/or aqueous tap performed per
investigator discretion, IOP measurement will be repeated at 60 (±10) minutes post-
injection.
-If post-injection IOP at 60 (±10) minutes is > 21 mmHg after eye massage and/oraqueous tap performed per investigator discretion, IOP measurement will be repeated at90 (±10) minutes post-injection.
-If there is an increase of ≥ 10 mmHg at 90 (±10) minutes post-injection compared to
Baseline IOP, the subject should be prescribed a topi[INVESTIGATOR_15434]-lowering medication until heor she returns for follow- up per the Clinical Investigator’s discretion (an unsche duled
visit may apply).
-On the other hand, a subject with IOP measurement of > 21 mmHg will be managedaccording to the discretion of the Clinical Investigator.
-TheIOP increase of ≥  10 mmHg from Baseline AND IOP measurement of > 21 mmHg
will be reported as an AE.
•Aqueous tap can be performed at any time per the Clinical Investigator`s discretion fortreatment or prevention of increasing in the IOP.
The applanation tonometer must be calibrated for accuracy before the first subject undergoes 
screening, and periodically until the last subject has exited the study. For checking calibration, 
follow the manufacturer’s instructions.
The following IOP measurement procedure is in accordance with the procedure used in the Ocular 
Hypertension Treatment Study (Gordon et al., 2001 ) at each visit:
At least two, and sometimes three, consecutive measurements are made to obtain a determination of intraocular pressure. Each IOP measurement should be recorded in the subject’s source document and in the eCRFs.
•If the two measurements differ by 2 mmHg or less, then the average of the two
measurements becomes the recorded IOP. For example, if the two measurements are 22 and23, then 22.5 is the final recorded IOP.
•However, if the two measurements differ by [ADDRESS_469492] measurement ismade, and the median of the three measurements becomes the recorded IOP (the median isthe middle measurement after arraying the measurements from low to high). For example,
if the three measurements are 15, 19, and 16, then 16 is the final recorded IOP.
•The IOP in the left eye is then measured using the same technique.
RBM-[ADDRESS_469493] 
ophthalmoscopy will be performed prior to the (first) injection and then again within 30 minutes after the (second) injections on the Visit 1 (Day1),  Visit 3 (Week 4), Visit 4 (Week 8) and Visit 5 (Week 12). Areas to be assessed include cup to disc ratio, peripheral retina, macula, choroid, and vitreous. This will be also applied for the post IVT injection of Rescue treatment.
 
Cup/Disc Ratio
The cup/disc ratio will be determined by [CONTACT_375058] 
(e.g., 0.80).
  
Retina, Macula and Choroid
The retina, macula and choroid will be evaluated for the presence of any clinically significant 
abnormalities, and graded as either normal (within normal limits) or abnormal (clinically significant abnormality present). A description of any abnormalities will be noted.
Vitreous
The following National Eye Institute Grading Scheme will be used to measure vitreous haze 
and opacification (Nussenblatt et al., 1985) .
Vitreous Haze Scale
Step Description
(0) Clear
(Trace or 0.5+) Trace
(1+) Few opacities, mild blurring
(2+) Significant blurring but still visible
(3+) Optic nerve visible, no vessels seen
(4+) Dense opacity obscures the optic nerve head
21.4.[ADDRESS_469494] angiography images will be taken only at selected sites at study Visit 1 (Day1) and Visit 6 (Week 16) in subjects showing SHRM on the Visit 0 (Screening) SD-OCT. The images may be stored in the EDC and sent to the central reading center at a later date at Sponsor discretion.

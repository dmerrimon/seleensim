omedication prescribed here in the clinic and follow-up care, or
opsychiatry referral.
If you participate, you will answer questions and start one of the treatments today. We 
will also call you in 6 and 12 weeks.
You will be randomly assigned to one of the two treatments.
Risks: If you participate, there are some risks. We may learn more about your mood 
symptoms. The treatment may have side effects (similar to regular medical care).
Benefits: The study treatments are standard treatments for anxiety and depression. Your 
symptoms may improve.
Alternatives: Treatment for anxiety or depression outside the study

WHY IS THIS STUDY BEING DONE?
To see how people with epi[INVESTIGATOR_324232]/or depression. The 
study is assessing adherence to anxiety and depression medication prescribed by [CONTACT_324237][INVESTIGATOR_324233] a mental health professional. The medications prescribed in this study, 
escitalopram and venlafaxine XR, are FDA approved for anxiety and depression.
HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL TAKE PART?
[ADDRESS_400295] Medical Center.
WHAT IS INVOLVED?
This study involves:
A set of questions after your doctor visit today. We will ask questions about your medical 
history, medications, mood and quality of life. This will take less than 1 hour.
You will be assigned at random to one of two study groups . This means you are put 
into a group by [CONTACT_3364]. It is like flippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a coin. You will have equal chance of being placed 
in any group. You will be assigned to one of these two common treatments for anxiety 
and/or depression:
1.  A prescription from your neurologist for a  medication.
Lexapro (escitalopram) 10mg daily. We may change the dose or switch 
to Effexor XR (venlafaxine XR) 37.5mg daily.
2.  A psychiatry referral. Psychiatry referrals are a standard care for depression or 
anxiety.
We will call you in 6 weeks to see how you are. We will mail you the questions. This will 
take 15 minutes.
We will call you in 12 weeks to see how you are. We will mail you the questions. This 
should take 20 minutes. Also, another team member will call and ask about your medication 
or psychiatry appointment. This will take less than 10 m i n u t e s .
Also, if you are prescribed medication today – you will receive follow-up
medical care from your doctor’s Nurse Practitioner (NP) or Physician Assistant (PA):
oWe will call you every two weeks. These medication phone calls are to see how

HOW LONG WILL I BE IN THE STUDY?

potential risk.
WHAT ARE THE RISKS?
The medications and psychiatry referrals are common treatments. But, there is slight risk. Risks 
include:
When you answer questions about your mood, we may find new symptoms 
When treatment is started for anxiety and/or depression, your symptoms might worsen. 
The risk is no higher than in usual medical care.
If you receive the medication, there may be medication side effects. Few people have side 
effects. Common side effects of escitalopram are: trouble sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]; ejaculation disorder; 
nausea; sweating; fatigue and sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008]. Less common side effects are: dry mouth; 
dizziness; diarrhea; constipation; indigestion; stomach pain; flulike symptoms; low 
appetite; sexual problems; sinusitis and rhinitis. Common

IRB Template Version 6.7.2017side effects of venlafaxine XR are nausea; sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008]; dry mouth; sweating; sexual 
problems; low appetite; and constipation. Less common side effects are low energy; high 
blood pressure; heart racing; blood vessel changes; constipation; diarrhea; vomiting; 
strange dreams; dizziness; trouble sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]; nervousness; tingling; tremor; yawning and 
vision changes. Other, rare side effects may occur with both medications. Another risk is 
suicidal thoughts. This is most likely in the first few weeks after starting medication or with 
dose change. We can discuss side effects, change your dose or switch medication if needed.
Since you are randomized to one of two standard of care treatments for anxiety and 
depression, researchers do not know which group will have a better outcome. You could 
be assigned to the group which performs either better or worse than the other group.
There is a small risk that de-identified information might be re-identified or there could be 
a breach of confidentiality.
During the study, you will be asked questions about your mood, thoughts, and 
actions. If we learn you or someone else is in danger, the study team is required to 
report this to the proper authorities.
You should discuss the risk of this study with the study staff.
A Data Safety and Monitoring Committee will review the data throughout the study.
Reproductive Risks 
Due to uncertain risk of birth defects with the study medications, we encourage women of 
childbearing potential to use reliable birth control. Reliable birth control includes: not having sex; 
oral contraceptives; intrauterine device (IUD); Depo-Provera; tubal ligation; or vasectomy of the 
partner (with negative sperm counts) in a monogamous relationship (same partner). An acceptable, 
but less reliable, method is careful use of condoms and spermicide and/or a cervical cap or sponge. 
You should discuss this with your doctor if you have questions. If you are pregnant or breast 
feeding, you will not be enrolled.
ARE THERE BENEFITS?
If you agree to participate, there may or may not be benefit. Your anxiety or depression may 
improve. We hope the information from this study will help others in the future.

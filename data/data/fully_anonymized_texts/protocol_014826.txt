Planned Sample Size:  Assum ing that the proportions of outpatients who are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_190290] -19 related disease or die due to any reason within 28 days of 
randomization are 30% and 15% for placebo and camostat mesilate groups , 
respectively , based on the two-sided Fisher's Exact Test, at the ta rget 
significance level of 5%, 275 outpatients ( 183 in camostat mesilate group 
and 92 in placebo group) are needed to achieve 80% power.  Thus, 
approximately 300 outpatients (200 in the camostat mesilate group and 100  
in the placebo group) will be randomized to account for subject  drop- out. 
Investigational Therapy:  Camostat mesilate as  100 mg tablets , taken orally. Study dose: two 100 mg 
tablets (200 mg total) taken 4  times a day for 14 days.

Page  7 of 53 Reference Therapy:  Placebo tablet identical in appearance to camostat mesilate . Study dose:  two 
placebo tablets taken 4  times a day  for 14 days. 
Treatment Duration:  Subjects will be treated for 14 days and followed until Day  28  
Efficacy  Assessments : Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  (Primary Efficacy Endpoint) is defined as status changing 
from ambulatory  care to COVID -19 related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_855529] 28. Presenting to the emergency room is 
considered hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
Resolution of fever  is defined as the time (in hours) from initiation of study 
treatment (active or placebo) until normalization of fever ( ≤ 37.2 °C oral ) 
and sustained  for at least 72 hours ; this will only be assessed in subjects 
who experienced a fever within 24 hours of enrollment . 
Overall survival rate  defined as the proportion of randomized subjects who 
survive up to Day 15 and Day 28.  
Proportion of subjects with no viral shedding (yes/no) using RT -PCR at 
Day 7 and Day 15.  
Safety  Assessments : • Incidence of AEs: overall, treatment -related, grade 3 or hi gher in 
severity, serious, fatal, and those resulting in treatment discontinuation  
• Changes from baseline in clinical laboratory values judged as clinically 
significant will be listed as AEs. Laboratory values  of interest will be  
monitor ed, including platelet counts, liver function tests ( aspartate 
aminotransferase [ AST ], alanine aminotransferase [ ALT ], alkaline 
phosphatase [ ALP ], gamma -glutamyl transferase [ GGT ]), and 
potassium levels.  
• Changes from baseline of vital signs ( i.e., blood pressure, SpO2, and 
heart rate)  
Statistical Methods and 
Planned Analyses:  The detailed methodology for summary and statistical analysis of the data 
collected in this trial will be documented in a Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
In general, all efficacy endpoints and major safety endpoints will be 
summarized using descriptive statistics ( e.g., proportions for categorical 
data, means and standard deviations  for continuous data, median for time -
to-event data).  The primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints will be 
analyzed u sing appropriate statistical models.  
Analysis Populations:  
The Intent -to-Treat (ITT) population will include all subjects who are 
randomized. Subjects will be analyzed according to their study treatment 
assignment, not according to the treatment actually received. The ITT population will be used for evaluating primary and secondary efficacy endpoints and subject characteristics.  
The Per -Protocol (PP) population will include all subjects in the ITT 
population who complete the 28- day study and have no major protocol 
deviations. The PP population will be used for primary and secondary efficacy endpoints.  
Sagent Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  NI03 -CV19 -[ADDRESS_1191621] 1  dose of 
study medication  (camostat mesilate or placebo) . The Safety population 
will be used for all summaries of safety and tolerability  data.  
Efficacy Analyses  
The primary endpoint (the proportion of subjects requiring COVID -19 
related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_855530] 28 days of 
randomization ) will be a nalyzed using the Fisher exact test in ITT and PP 
populations . The primary endpoint will also be analyzed using the Mantel -
Haenszel (MH) test, and the 95% Clopper -Pearson confidence interval (CI) 
will be reported. In addition, the continuity -corrected Newc ombe CI for the 
proportion al difference between treatment groups will be reported.  The 
logistic regression  model with treatment group, sex , race, duration of 
symptoms prior to enrollment, age groups (<65 versus ≥ 65 years) and other 
risk factors as covariates may be used to investigate the potential influences 
of demographic and baseline characteristics.  The odds  ratios and their 95% 
CIs will be estimated.  
The overall survival rate up to Day [ADDRESS_1191622] will be used to 
analyze these time-to-event endpoints. The median event time  and their 
corresponding 2- sided 95% CIs will be provided for each treatment arm.  
The Cox proportional hazard model with treatment group, sex, race, 
duration of symptoms , age groups (< 65 versus ≥ 65 years) and other risk 
factors as covariates may be used to investigate the p otential influences of 
demograph ic and baseline characteristi cs. The hazard ratios and their 95% 
CIs will be estimated . Additionally, the change from baseline in clinical 
symptoms and viral shedding will be summarized using shift tables.   
A sensi tivity analysis for efficacy endpoint s will be performed for central 
laboratory confirmed COVID -19 subjects  in the ITT population.

Page  16 of 53 5 INTRODUCTION 
On 31 December 2019, the World Health Organization ( WHO)  was informed of a cluster of 
cases of pneumonia of unknown cause detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China. T he 
severe acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_7686] – coronavirus -2 (SARS -CoV -2) was identified as the 
causative virus of the disease currently referred to as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) by 
[CONTACT_190344] 07 January 2020 ( WHO, 2020).  
The rapid spread of COVID -19 presents an increasing threat to human health globally. The virus 
has subsequently spread throughout the world and was declared a pandemic by [CONTACT_941] W HO on 
11 March  2020. Among patients infected with SARS CoV -2 are cases progressing to severe 
disease symptoms including acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505] (ARDS), pneumonia, 
pulmonary edema, and organ failure . These pathologies are driven by [CONTACT_855548] ( Cascella et al, 2020 ). As of the writing of this protocol, the number of 
cases of COVID -19 exceeds 7 million an d the resulting number of deaths worldwide continue to 
climb.  
5.1 Background on  COVID -19 
5.1.1 Overview of COVID -19 Disease  
Gand hi et al , 2020 discusses the presentation, management, prevention, and control of patients 
with mild or moderate COVID -19. SARS -CoV -2 is a novel betacoronavirus related to bat 
coronaviruses that was thought to originate from a seafood market in Wuhan, China , where live 
animals were sold. There is much still unknown about COVID -19, but data from China indicated 
that 81% of people who become infected have a mild or moderate form of the disease (with no or mild pneumonia), 14% have a severe disease, and 5% have a critical form of the disease.   
COVID -19 is spread from person to person through an infected person’s respi[INVESTIGATOR_855532] , sneezes , or even just speaking. It may also be contracted from a contaminated 
surface when a person touches the surface and then touches their face, transferring the virus to a 
mucosa l membrane. Droplets are able to  travel for approximately [ADDRESS_1191629] 1.8 meters (6 feet) apart from others will reduce the 
likelihood of transmission. The virus may live on certain surfaces (cardboard, plastic, and stainless  steel) for days; therefore, sterilizing surfaces with antibacterial cleaners will also reduce 
transmission. Personal protective equipment for health care workers is essential  to prevent the 
spread of COVID -19. Testing and diagnosis  of patients is important so that those who are 
infected can self -isolate to prevent the spread to others  (Gandhi et al , 2020) .  
An infected person may or may not display symptoms. Presymptomatic people may infect other s 
for 1 to 3 days before display ing symptoms , and the virus is detectable during this time . The time 
from exposure to the time of displaying symptoms can be  from 2 to 14 days, with 97.5% of 
people displaying symptoms within 11.[ADDRESS_1191630] before or soon after symptoms start. Viral levels will

Camostat Mesilate  Version  4.0 
 
This document is confidential.  
Page  17 of 53 continue  to be detectable but will fall over the next week. Patients with severe COVID -19 illness 
may continue viral shedding longer, but how long viral shedding continues is not known at this 
time (Gandhi et al , 2020) .  
COVID -19 is diagnosed by [CONTACT_855549] -polymerase chain reaction (RT -PCR) 
from a nasopharyngeal swab sample. The sensitivity of this assay is high but not 100%; therefore repeat testing is important if the person continues to exhibit symptoms, has knowingly been exposed, or lives in an area where there are a high number of COVID -19 cases  (Gandhi et al , 
2020) .  
The most common symptoms of a mild to moderate COVID -19 infection are fever, cough, sore 
throat, malaise, and myalgia. Anorexia, nausea, diarrhea, anosmia, and ageusia are often  
reported. Dyspnea may occur (usually 5 to 8 days after symptom onset) and is suggestive of 
more severe disease, often  a precursor to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Dyspnea can occur in patients with 
moderate disease but the oxygen saturation is usually at least 94% on room air  (Gandhi et al , 
2020) . Importantly, clinical deterioration typi[INVESTIGATOR_855533] 5  to 7 days 
following symptom onset, suggesting there is a window of opportunity for antiviral therapy early in the infection prior to the s ubsequent onset of severe systemic inflammation. 
Certain comorbid conditions render a person more susceptible to contracting COVID -19 and 
contribute to worsening of the disease to a more severe version. These conditions include: age 
≥ 65 years , cardiovascu lar disease, chronic lung disease, hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and 
diseases that weaken the immune system  (Gandhi et al , 2020) .  
Patients with mild or moderate COVID -19 are usually instructed to recover at home, where they 
can be isolated, observed, monitored, and receive supportive care. However, some patient’s conditions may deteriorate, especially those with comorbid conditions, which most often happens a week after onset of symptoms. These patients should be monitored closely.  Patients 
with mild to moderate disease are able to  monitor their own oxygen saturation levels if they are 
given a pulse oximeter  (Gandhi et al , 2020) .  
Other than supportive care, remde sivir is the only treatment at this time that has proven efficacy 
from a Phase 3 randomized, placebo -controlled clinical trial, but, importantly, this was only 
administered to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_249107] -19. A preliminary report of early 
unblinding of the result s showed a statistically significant, shortened time to recovery in the 
group that received remdesivir (11 days) compared with  those who received placebo (15 days). 
Kaplan -Meier estimates of mortality by 14 days were 7.1% for remdesivir and 11.9% for 
placebo, which  was not a statistically significant difference ( Beigel JH et al , 2020). There 
currently is no vaccine that provides  immunity against COVID -19. 
5.2 Background on Camostat Mesilate  
Camostat mesilate  was approved for  human use in Japan with the indication of “remission of 
acute symptoms of chronic pancreatitis” on [ADDRESS_1191631] step of 
SAR S-CoV -2 infection; namely, how the virus is able to get into human cells. S cientists found 
that the cellular protein protease TMPRSS2 is necessary for SARS -CoV -2 to enter lung cells , 
which is similar to SARS -CoV -1 (Hoffmann et al , 2020) . Entry of SARS -CoV -2 into the cell 
depends on the cell entry receptor protein angiotensin converting enzyme II ( ACE2 ) and the 
serine protease TMPRSS2. A protein on the viral  surface called a spi[INVESTIGATOR_855534]2 
receptor on the human cell  and then TMPRSS2 cleaves the spi[INVESTIGATOR_144870], allowing the virus to 
enter the cell and replicate inside of it. In this study, viral entry was inhibited by [CONTACT_855550], which is a k nown TMPRSS2 inhibitor. Therefore, camostat mesilate is a biologically 
plausible candidate to prevent the infection of SARS -CoV -2 or stop the progression of 
COVID -19 once a person is infected.  
Camos tat mesilate is already licensed in Japan and South Korea to treat chronic pancreatitis  and 
reflux esophagitis . A clinical trial using camostat mesilate for chronic pancreatitis is currently 
ongoing in the [LOCATION_002] (US) and is sponsored by [CONTACT_855551] -Iko Pharmaceutical  Co., Ltd, 
Sagent’s parent company . Because camostat mesilate is a known inhibitor of TMPRSS2 and has 
already been approved in Japan and South Korea and is currently under study for approval to treat pancrea titis in the U nited S tates, it is a potential  candidate for the treatment of COVID -19, 
one that could be available much sooner than a drug  that would still have to go through all 
development phases .  
A Danish clinical trial using camostat mesilate is currently ongoing in subject s diagnosed with 
COVID -19. Subject s in this trial will receive  two 100 mg pi[INVESTIGATOR_855535] 
3 times daily ( TID) for 5 days ; however, justification for this dosing is not publicly available . 
This study is designed to treat subjects in the U nited S tates with mild to moderate confirmed 
COVID -19 with a dos ing regimen of 200 mg 4 times daily (QID) for 14 days. Dosing is based on 
the antiviral indication, as well as current data related to pharmacokinetics  (PK)  and safety.

dogs, rabbits, hamster cells (hERG gene), various bacteria (Ames mutation test), and healthy 
humans . Nonclinical  studies , including in -vitro and in -vivo pharmacology ; PK including 
administration, distribution, metabolism, and excretion; safety pharmacology ; toxicology and 
toxicokinetic evaluations; genotoxicity; tolerance studies; and reproduction and development 
studies have all been completed.  Camostat mesilate ’s effect on general sy mptoms, central 
nervous system, autonomic nervous system, cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_2133], reproduction, and urinary system as well as local irritation and antigenicity have all been evaluated. The test methods a nd 
results of these studies can be found in the current version of the Investigator’s Brochure  (Sagent

Camostat mesilate or Foipan®, has been approved in Japan since [ADDRESS_1191633] s with acute, 
chronic, or postoperative pancreatitis were conducted, with the majority of subjects dosed at 
200 mg TID . The duration of dosing ranged from 2 weeks to more than 13 weeks. Few adverse 
events (AEs) were reported and no serious adverse events (SAEs) were documented from these studies. These studies did not have formal statistical tests, but did show a decrease in se rum and 
urinary amylase levels throughout the treatment period ( Kinami et al, 1980 ; Hirayama et al, 
1980a ; Abe et al, 1980; Fujiwara et al, 1980; Hayawaka et al, 1980; Hirono, 1980; Horiguchi et 
al, 1980; Kubota and Meada, 1980; Tanaka and Tsuchiya, 1980) . 
Two studies by [CONTACT_855552]  (Hirayama et al , 
1980a , Hirayama et al , 1980b) . In both of these studies, camostat mesilate  was dosed at 200 mg 
TID. Both studies showed that camostat mesilate significantly reduced serum and urine amylase levels. Only 1 AE was reported in the camostat mesilate  group compared with none in the 
placebo group.  
A PK and safety Phase 1/2 study (NI03- 001) is currently being  conducted in the U nited S tates 
with 2  phases  (Ramsey et al , 2019) . In the first phase, a single -dose of camo stat mesilate  at doses 
of 100 mg, 200 mg, and 300 mg were administered to  18 subjects with chronic pancreatitis. 
At 
all doses, camostat mesilate  displayed markedly lower exposure (maximum serum concentration 
[Cmax] and area under the curve [AUC ]) than the 2 metabolites. 4-GBA exposure appeared to be 2 
to 3 times  higher than that of FOY -251. Camostat mesilate  exposure did not increase as the doses of 
camostat mesilate  increased, which may be explained by [CONTACT_855553]. FOY -251 exposure increased as the doses of camostat mesilate  increased from 
100 mg to the 200 mg, but not from the 200 mg to the 300 mg. 4-GBA exposure (both Cmax and 
AUC) increased as the doses of camostat mesilate  increased from 100 mg to the 200 mg, but only the 
AUC slightly increased from the 200 mg to the 300 mg. There were no deaths or SAEs, and 3 out of 18 subjects reported 4 treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs). Two TEAEs were mild and [ADDRESS_1191634] phase of this study suggested that the camostat mesilate  is safe to 
administer to subjects with chronic pancreatitis as a single dose up to and including 300 mg. 
The second phase of Study NI03- 001 i s a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study of 
3 doses of camostat mesilate  (100 mg, 200 mg, and 300 mg) administered TID for 28 days for 
the treatment of chronic pancreatitis associated pain. This study is still ongoing and data remain  
blinded. Six  SAEs (nephrolithiasis, diabetic ketoacidosis, abdominal pain [2 events], pancreatitis, 
pancreatitis acute) have been  reported from [ADDRESS_1191635] s with pancreatitis reported 
that adverse effects were rare (< 3%), mostly mild, such as pruritus, increased thirst and appetite, and light headedness  (Abe et al , 1980;  Ishii et al, 1980) . 
5.3 Clinical Risks/Benefits of Camostat Mesilate  
Camostat mesilate  has been available in Japan for 30 years where it is used  for the treatment for 
relief of the acute symptoms of chronic pancreatitis  and postoperative reflux esophagitis . The 
following is taken directly from the package i nsert for Foipan
® (camostat mesilate) and is 
considered an important precaution:  
Foipan Tablet® [ADDRESS_1191636] -marketing surveillance study, 83 adverse reactions (including 
abnormal clinical laboratory te st values) were observed in 69 of 3806 subjects 
(1.8%). The main adverse reactions were 15 cases of rash (0.4%), 9  cases of 
itching (pruritus; 0.2%), 10 cases of nausea (0.3%), 7 cases of abdominal discomfort (0.2%), and 6  cases of abdominal bloating (0.2% ).  
From a postoperative reflux esophagitis investigation for FOIPAN performed up 
to the time of approval and in the Drug Use Investigation, 75 AEs were reported in 57 (1.3%) out of 4224 subjects. The major AEs were 12 (0.3%) cases of hepatic 
function abnormal ities such as increased AST and ALT, 8 (0.2%) cases of 
diarrhea, and 5 (0.1%) cases of nausea.  
The Foipan
® packa ge insert  also details the following significant adverse reactions:  
Symptoms of Shock and Anaphylaxis  
Sagent Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  NI03 -CV19 -[ADDRESS_1191637] -marketing 
surveillance. No specific antibody production has been reported with the drug in 
antigenicity studies in animals. However, in view of time course of symptom 
development (symptoms developed within [ADDRESS_1191638] cases), 
initial symptoms (dermatitis such as welts, itching sensation, and erythema, vertigo, feeling poorly, dull headache, sweaty, cold sweat, edema/swelling, dyspnea, and decrease in blood pressure), and subjects who had a past history of 
administration of this drug had experienced symptoms of hypersensitivity ( e.g., 
urticaria, itching sensation and edema), these may have occurred due to anaphylactic reactions.  
Thrombocyto penia 
Serious decreased platelets have been reporte d from post -marketing surveillance. 
Symptoms included subcutaneous hemorrhage, oral hemorrhage, and epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940]. The 
number of days until the onset was within [ADDRESS_1191639] cases. 
Possible idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura was suspec ted in some reported cases. 
In subacute and chronic toxicity studies of the drug, the decrease in platelets was not 
observed, and the mechanism of pathogenesis remains unknown. 
Hepatic Function Disorder, Jaundice  
Hepatic function disorder and jaundice (bot h with unknown frequency), accompanied 
by [CONTACT_855554] ( AST ), alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT ), and gamma -glutamyl transferase  (GGT ), and alkaline phosphatase  (ALP) 
have been reported from post -marketing surveillance. Initial symptoms included 
general fatigue, nausea and vomiting, and jaundice. Most of disorders occurred without subjective symptoms and identified by [CONTACT_855555]. The duration 
from the beginning of dosage to onset was 12 months in many cases. Som e disorders 
occurred (identified) after the end of administration of the drug. In subacute and chronic toxicity studies of the drug, hepatic function abnormal was not observed, and 
the mechanism of pathogenesis remains unknown.  
Hyperkalemia  
Serious hyperka lemia ha s been reported from post -marketing surveillance , 
although the frequency is unknown due to spontaneous reporting . Most of the 
disorders occurred without subjective symptoms and were identified by [CONTACT_855556]. Abnormal electrocardiograms or  electrocardiogram abnormalities 
with clinical symptoms (general fatigue and sensation of heaviness in chest) were observed in some cases. The duration from the beginning of dosage to the onset was within [ADDRESS_1191640] cases. In subacute and chronic tox icity studies of the 
drug, abnormal changes in potassium levels were not observed, and the 
mechanism of pathogenesis remains unknown.

8.2 Exclusion Criteria  
Individuals  meeting any of the following criteria at screening or baseline are ineligible to 
participate in this study: 
1. Physician makes a decision that trial involvement is not in subjects' best interest, or any 
condition that does not allow the protocol to be followed safely  
2. Known s evere liver disease ( e.g., Child Pugh score >  12, AST  > 5 times upper limit)  
3. Oxygen saturation  (SaO2 )/SpO2 ≤  94% in room air condition, or the arterial oxygen partial 
pressure  (PaO2)/fractional inspi[INVESTIGATOR_1401]  (FiO2) ratio <  [ADDRESS_1191647] acting antiviral activity, including, but not limited to, hydroxychloroquine, 
lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir, tocilizumab, ivermectin, or remdesivir within the 30 days  prior to the 
time of the screening evaluation. No off -label use of a drug for CO VID-19 is allowed.

meets all other entry criteria requirements. Nasal mid-turbinate swab samples are also to be 
obtained at the S creening /Baseline and Day [ADDRESS_1191649] for viral shedding . If a subjects ’ test performed at 
the local laboratory is positive for COVID -[ADDRESS_1191650] will  stay in the study and complete all study visits. The reason for this is 
that RT -PCR testing is not sensitive enough to be accurate 100% of the time. These subjects will 
provide safety data for camostat mesilate. Statistical analysis for efficacy endpoints may be 
adjuste d for subjects who fall into this category.  
8.4 Rescreening  
Individuals who sign the informed consent form ( ICF) to participate in the study  but who do not 
subsequently meet all the requirements as outlined in the inclusion and exclusion criteria and 
therefore do not enroll  (screen failures)  may  not be rescreened.

study site within [ADDRESS_1191652] administration of study drug to comp lete assessments as 
indicated in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 ) (Early Termination Visit) . 
In the event that a subject  discontinues  prematurely from the study because of a TEAE or SAE , 
the TEAE or SAE  will be followed up until it resolves (returns to normal or baseline values) or 
stabilizes, or until it is judged by [CONTACT_855558] 28. 
Upon discontinuation every effort will be made to follow the subjects until Day [ADDRESS_1191653]  may voluntarily withdraw or be withdrawn from the study at any time for reasons 
including, but not limited to, the following:  
• AE and/or SAE  
• subject  withdrawal of consent: at any time, a subject's  participation in the study may be 
terminate d at his/her request or on the basis of the investigator’s clinical judgment.  The 
reason for subject  withdrawal will be noted on the e CRF.  
• intercurrent illness: a co ndition, injury, or disease unrelated to the primary diagnosis that 
became apparent during treatment and necessitated the subject ’s termination from the 
study  
• general or specific changes in the subject's  condition that renders him/her ineligible for 
furthe r treatment according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria  
• subject  fails to adhere to the protocol requirements ( e.g., drug noncompliance, failure to 
return for defined number of visits)   
• lost to follow -up: the subject  stopped coming for visits, and study personnel were unable 
to contact [CONTACT_423]  
• pregnancy, as indicated in Section  12.4.5. 
Additionally, the S ponsor  may stop the study at any time for safety, regulatory, legal, or other 
reasons aligned with good clinical practice ( GCP ). This study may be terminated at the discretion 
of the S ponsor  or any regulatory agency. An investigator may elect to discontinue or stop the 
study at his or her study site for any reason, including safety or low enrollment.

9.1 Details of Study Treatments  
Camostat mesilate , N, N-dimethylcarbamoylmethyl 4 -(4-guanidinobenzoyloxy)-phenylacetate 
methanesulfonate, a guanidinobenzoic acid derivative is an orally active protease inhibitor with 
potent inhibitory effects on trypsin, plasma kallikrein, plasmin, thrombin, C 1r and C 1 esterase but 
does not attenuate α -chymotrypsin, pepsin, or pancreatin. C amostat mesilate  is presented as  a 
film-coated tablet  that is white to yellowish white in appearance . Each tablet contains 100 mg 
camostat mesilate.  
All drug  supplies will be provided by [CONTACT_941] S ponsor.  Camostat mesilate will be manuf actured in 
tablet form by [CONTACT_855551]- Iko Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Japan). Placebo tablets will be manufactured 
by [CONTACT_855559], Inc . (Irvine CA).  
Active Treatment Arm: two 100 mg tablets of camostat mesilate taken orally QID  (total daily 
dose of 800 mg)  
Placebo Arm: 2 matching placebo table ts taken orally QID   
Study drug  will be supplied in  high density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles, each bottle containing 
112 table ts of active drug or matching placebo. Each bottle  will be labeled with  a randomized 
bottle number, the name [CONTACT_49256], expi[INVESTIGATOR_320], and other information 
required by [CONTACT_3133] ( FDA ) regulations.  
Study drug must be stored at controlled room temperature (15℃  to 30℃ ; 59℉  to 86℉ ) in a limited 
access, secured storage area until dispensed. The storage conditions should be monitored daily . 
9.2 Dosage Schedule  
Study drug is administered as 2 tablets taken orally QID for 14  days.  Study drug  should ideal ly 
be taken with  a meal or snack  (breakfast, lunch, dinner) , but it is not required. Tablets should be 
taken 3 times during the day and the fourth dose should be taken in the late evening  (bedtime) , 
with the dosing spaced approximately [ADDRESS_1191654] misses a dose, there should be 
no less than 2 hours between doses.  
9.3 Measures to Minimize B ias: Study Treatment  Assignment and  Blinding  
9.3.[ADDRESS_1191655] number.   
According to the randomization schedule as indicated in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 ), the 
investigator or designee will obtain the randomization number from the IWRS software .  The IWRS 
software will use the blinded study arm linked to the randomization number to select a bottle number 
containing the correct study product (active or placebo) which is known to the IWRS to be in the 
possession of the site. The pharmacist or designee will provide the assigned bottle  to the subject. No 
Sagent Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  NI03 -CV19 -[ADDRESS_1191656]’s  study treatment, that  subject  will be discontinued 
from the study unless there are ethical reasons for that subject  not to be discontinued; approval from 
the Sponsor’s M edical M onitor must be obtained in such instances. 
In the event that emergency unblinding is required for a given subject  because of AEs or concerns for 
the subject’s  safety or wellbeing, the  IWRS software will perform the unblinding . The IWRS 
software limits access to the emergency unblinding function to designated personnel and records the 
date, time, and person performing the unblinding. The unblinding and its cause will also be 
documented on the eCRF  via automated entry by [CONTACT_8784] . 
9.3.2 Blinding  
This is randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study. Subjects will be  randomized in a 2:1 
ratio to camostat mesilate:placebo. None of the investigators, study site personnel , Sponsor, or 
subjects will know  to which treatment the subjects were randomized. To maintain  the blind, 
camostat mesilate and placebo tablets will be indistinguishable from one another  and are  
identified in distribution to study sites and dispensing to study  subjects by a randomized number 
assigned to each bottle known only to the packager (Stason) and the IWRS .  
The labeling, shipment, and receipt of the bottles at  the study sites are all recorded in the IWRS 
software, contributing to the blinding of the assigned product after study randomization by 
[CONTACT_855560] t contents of bottles assigned to study subjects. 
The assignment of the blinded randomization number to a subject and selection of a bottle 
number for the corresponding blind- labeled product bottle are controlled by [CONTACT_855561] g study arm or product assignment to any party.

include dates, quantities, batch/serial numbers, expi[INVESTIGATOR_1659], in- clinic  temperature log s, and 
unique code numbers assigned to the product and study subjects . 
At each visit after initiation of treatment, study site personnel will record compliance . Subjects  
will be instructed to bring their unused/partially used  bottles  back f or inspection at each study 
visit. Subjects  are to be reminded of the importance of compliance with an emphasis on taking 
their study drug on schedule and maintaining the prescribed interval between doses. 
Investigators will maintain records that adequatel y document that the s ubjects  were provided

10.3 Study Procedures  
Assessments and their timing are to be performed as outlined in the Schedule of Assessments 
(Table 1) . Section  12.3 specifies laboratory assessment samples to be obtained.  
Assessments and procedures scheduled at a visit where study drug is administered shoul d be 
performed before administration of study drug  unless otherwise indicated in the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table 1).  
Efficacy  assessments are described in Section 11 and include  recording of  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_855538] (if not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]),  resolution of fever , overall survival rate, and viral 
shedding. 
Safety assessments are described in Sect ion [ADDRESS_1191665] igator may , at his/her discretion, arrange for a subject  to have an unscheduled 
assessment, especially in the case of AEs that require follow -up or are considered by [CONTACT_190370]. The unscheduled visit page on the 
eCRF  must be completed.   
Study discontinuation procedures are described in Section  8.5. 
Follow -up of AEs and SAEs leading to study discontinuation is discussed in Section  8.5. 
11 EFFICACY ASSESSMENTS  
The Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1) outlines the efficacy assessments to be performed 
throughout the study and their timing . 
Sagent Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  NI03 -CV19 -[ADDRESS_1191666] e Diary  
• Subjects will be provided access to  an eDiary and completion instructions  at the baseline visit 
(Day  1). Adequate time should be allocated on Day [ADDRESS_1191667] understands 
how to access the eDiary  portal to complete the daily eD iary and is willing and able to do so 
every  day throughout the study. NOTE : The objective s and endpoint s for this study relies on 
subject reported data collected via the eDiary. It is critical that the Investigator and subject 
understand that accurate, complete, and contemporaneous eD iary data is required to meet the 
study primary objective. It is particularly importa nt to ensure that each subject completes the 
eDiary every day. The eDiary  will have reminders for subjects to take the study drug  and to 
complete the eDiary  daily.  The site will check the portal to be sure the subject is completing 
the eDiary daily. It is suggested that the sites should call the subject on Day [ADDRESS_1191668] the following details in their eDiary : 
• Number of doses taken in the previous 24 hours  
• Oral body  temperature at the time of diary completion 
• Highest oral temperature obtained in the last 24 hours (if additional temperatures were 
obtained the previous day that were not recorded in the diary the day before) 
Information from the eD iary will be used dire ctly for analysis of the secondary endpoints. The 
Investigator or designee will be required to monitor the subject’s eDiary  entries and contact [CONTACT_855565].  
11.2 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (Primary Efficacy Endpoint)

comorbid conditions, present at the time when informed consent is given and up to the time of 
first dosing ( Day 1 ). Medical history will include alcohol consumption and smoking  history , if 
applicable.  
Illnesses first occurring or detected during the study and/or worsening of a concomitant illness during the study are to be documented as AEs on the e CRF  in accordance with Section  12.4. All 
changes not present at baseline or described in the past medical history and identified as 
clinically noteworthy must be recorded as AEs.  
Additionally, demographic data will be collected f or all subjects  and include age, sex , race, and 
ethnicity . 
Prior and concomi tant medications are to be recorded on the eCRF. Refer to Section 9.6.1 for 
details.  
12.2 Vital Signs  and Body Temperature  – On -Site Visits  
Vital signs ( heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements , and SpO 2) and body 
temperature will be evaluated at  the visits indicated in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1). 
All vital signs will be measured after the subject  has been resting in a sitting position for at least 
5 minutes. Blood pressure measurements are to be taken in the same arm for the duration of the 
study. Body weight (without shoes) and height (without shoes) will be recorded at screening 
only. 
Vital sign measurements will be repeated if clinically significant or machine/equipment errors 
occur. Out -of-range blood pressure  or heart rate measu rements will be repeated at the

reviewed, signed, and dated by [CONTACT_093]. A legible copy of all reports must be filed with 
the subject’s  electronic source document s for that visit. Clinically significant abnormal values 
occurring during the study will  be followed up until repeat test results return to normal, stabilize, 
or are no longer clinically significant.  
12.4 Adverse Events  
12.4.1 Adverse Events  
An AE is any symptom, physical sign, syndrome, or disease that either emerges during the study or, if present at screening, worsens during the study, regardless of the suspected cause of the event. All medical and psychiatric conditions (except those relat ed to the indication under study) 
present at screening will be documented in the medical history eCRF. Changes in these 
conditions and new symptoms, physical signs, syndromes, or diseases should be noted on the AE eCRF during the rest of the study.  
Sagent Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  NI03 -CV19 -[ADDRESS_1191672]  is administered study medication (Day 1)  until Day 28  or early termination . 
Subjects with early termination will be followed up until Day 28. Follow -up of the AE, e ven 
after the date of therapy discontinuation, is required if the AE persists until the event resolves or 
stabilizes at a level acceptable to the investigator.  
When changes in the intensity of an AE occur more frequently than once a day, the maximum intens ity for the event should be noted. If the intensity category changes over a number of days, 
then those changes should be recorded separately (with distinct onset dates). 
Specific guidelines for classifying AEs by [CONTACT_855567] e given in 
Table 3 and Table 4.  
Table  3. Classification of Adverse Events by [CONTACT_240480] : An event that is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423] , causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with 
everyday activities.  
MODERATE : An event that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal everyday activities.  
SEVERE : An event that prevents normal everyday activities.

Page  39 of 53 Table  4. Classification of Adverse Events by [CONTACT_472807] : This category applies to those AEs that are clearly and incontrovertibly due to extraneous 
causes (disease, environment, etc. ). 
UNLIKELY : This category applies to those AEs that are judged to be unrelated to the study  drug but for which 
no extraneous c ause may be found. An AE may be considered unlikely to be related to study drug  if or when it 
meets 2 of the following criteria: (1) it does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of 
the study drug; (2) it could readily have been produced by [CONTACT_423]’s  clinical state, environmental or toxic 
factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the subject ; (3) it does not follow a known pattern of 
response to the study  drug; or (4) it does not reappear or worsen when the d rug is readministered.  
POSSIBLY : This category applies to those AEs for which a connection with the study  drug administration 
appears unlikely but cannot be ruled out with certainty. An AE may be considered possibly related if or w hen 
it meets 2 of the following criteria: (1) it follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug; (2) it could not readily have been produced by [CONTACT_423]’s  clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, 
or other modes of therapy administered to the subject ; or (3) it follows a known pattern of response to the 
study  drug. 
PROBABLY : This category applies to those AEs that the investigator feels with a high degree of certainty are 
related to the study  drug. An AE may be considered probably related if or when it meets 3 of the following 
criteria: (1) it follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug ; (2) it could not be 
reasonably explained by [CONTACT_20612]’s  clinical state, environm ental or toxic 
factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the subject ; (3) it disappears or decreases on cessation or 
reduction in dose (note that there are exceptions when an AE does not disappear upon discontinuation of the 
drug, yet drug -related ness clearly exists; for example, as in bone marrow depression, fixed drug eruptions, or 
tardive dyskinesia); or (4) it follows a known pattern of response to the study  drug. 
DEFINITELY :  This category applies to those AEs that the investigator feels are incontrovertibly related to 
study  drug. An AE may be assigned an attribution of definitely related if or when it meets all of the following 
criteria: (1) it follows a reasonable temporal se quence from administration of the drug ; (2) it could not be 
reasonably explained by [CONTACT_20612]’s  clinical state, environmental or toxic 
factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the subject ; (3) it disappears or decreases on cessation or 
reduction in dose and recurs with reexposure to drug (if rechallenge occurs); and (4) it follows a known pattern 
of response to the study  drug.

• is life -threatening , 
• results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] , 
• results in persistent or sign ificant disability/incapacity , and/or  
• is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
For the purposes of this study , death and inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_855541] , as the primary end point of this study is the proportion  of subjects requiring COVID -19 
related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (including emergency room visit) or who die due to any cause within 
[ADDRESS_1191674]  and/or require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes defining an SAE. SAEs are critically important for the identification 
of significant safety problems; therefore, it is important to take into account both the 
investigator’s and the Sponsor’s assessment. If either the Sponsor or the investigator believes 
that an event is serious, the event must be considered serious and evalua ted by [CONTACT_855568].  
12.4.[ADDRESS_1191675] be reported within 24 hours of 
occurrence or when the investigator becomes aware of the event. Notification can be made using 
the dedicated fax line or email  for the EVERSANA P harmacovigilance group:  
EVERSANA P harmacovigilance fax number: [PHONE_17753]  
EVERSANA P harmacovigilance email address : [EMAIL_16204]  
If the investigator contacts the EVERSANA P harmacovigilance group by [CONTACT_756], then a 
written report must follow within 24 hours and is to include a full description of the event and sequelae in the format detailed in the SAE reporting form. 
EVERSANA Pharmacovigilance telephone number: 1- [PHONE_17754]  
The event must also be recorded on the standard AE eCRF. Preliminar y reports of SAEs must be 
followed up by [CONTACT_202852], including clear and anonymized photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_73932], consultant reports, autopsy reports, and other documents when requested 
and applicable. SAE reports must be made w hether or not the investigator considers the event to 
be related to the investigational drug.  
Appropriate remedial measures should be taken to treat the SAE, and the response should be recorded. Clinical, laboratory, and diagnostic measures should be emplo yed as needed in order to 
determine the etiology of the problem. The investigator must report all additional follow -up 
evaluations to the EVERSANA Pharmacovigilance group within [ADDRESS_1191676]’s  
participation in the study is to be followed up until it either resolves, stabilizes, returns to 
baseline values (if a baseline value is available), or is shown to not be attributable to the study

Page  41 of 53 12.4.4 Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions  
Adverse event s that meet all of the f ollowing criteria will be classified as suspected unexpected 
serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) and reported to the appropriate regulatory authorities in 
accordance with applicable regulatory requirements for expedited reporting:  
• serious  
• unexpected ( i.e., the event is not consistent with the safety information in the IB)  
• there is at least a reasonable possibility that there is a causal relationship between the event 
and the study treatment  
The investigator will assess whether an event is causally related to  study treatment. The S ponsor 
(or EVERSANA) will consider the investigator’s assessment and determine whether the event 
meets the criteria for being reportable as a [ADDRESS_1191677]

them, with a follow -up report submitted within a further [ADDRESS_1191678] be 
reported to the relevant regulatory authorities and the IRBs within 15 calendar days after the 
Sponsor (or EVERSANA) first has knowledge of them. 
The S ponsor (or EVERSANA) is responsible for reporting S[LOCATION_003]Rs  and any other events 
required to be reported in an expedited m anner  to the regulatory authorities and for informing 
investigators of reportable events, in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements within specific timeframes. Investigators will notify the relevant IRBs of reportable events within the

of knowledge of the event. The pregnancy will not be processed as an SAE; however , the 
investigator will follow up with the subject  until completion of the pregnancy and must assess 
the outcome in the shortest possible time but not more than 30 days after completion of the pregnancy. The investigator should notify the S ponsor  (or EVERS ANA ) of the pregnancy 
outcome by [CONTACT_17258] a follow -up pregnancy report. If the outcome of the pregnancy involved 
spontaneous or therapeutic abortion ( any congenital anomaly detected in an aborted fetus is to be 
documented) , stillbirth, neonatal death, or  congenital anomaly, the investigator will report the 
event by [CONTACT_29658] /emailing  a completed pregnancy report form to the S ponsor  (or EVERSANA )

13 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
A statistical a nalysi s plan (SAP) will be prepared after the protocol is approved and subsequently 
submitted to the Investigational New Drug application before completion of the study . This 
document will provide further details regarding the definition of analysis variables an d analysis 
methodology to address all study objectives. The SAP will serve as a com panion document  to the 
protocol and supersedes it in case of differences.  
The statistical evaluation will be performed using SAS
® software  version 9.4 or higher 
(SAS  Institute, Cary, NC). All data will be listed, and summary tables will be provided.  
Summary statistics will be presented by [CONTACT_2948]. For continuous variables, data will be 
summarized with the number of subjects  (N), mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and 
maximum by [CONTACT_1570].  For categorical variables, data will be tabulated with the number 
and proportion of subjects  for ea ch category by [CONTACT_1570].   
In general, all efficacy endpoints and major safety endpoints will be summarized using descriptive statistics ( e.g., proportions for categorical data, means and standard deviations for 
continuous data, median for time -to-event data). The primary and key secondary efficacy 
endpoints will be analyzed using appropriate statistical models.  
A statistical analysis plan (SAP) will further describe the statistical analyses prior to unblinding of study and database lock. Missing data procedures will be described in the SAP.   
13.1 Determination of Sample Size 
Assuming that the proportions of outpatients who are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_191544] -19 related disease 
or die due to any reason  within 28 days of randomization are 30% and 15% for placebo and 
camostat mesilate groups, respectively, based on the two -sided Fisher's Exact Test, at the target 
significance lev el of 5%, 275 outpatients (183 in camostat mesilate group and 92 in placebo 
group) are needed to achieve 80% power. Thus, approximately 300 outpatients (200 in the camostat mesilate group and 100 in the placebo group) will be randomized to account for  subj ect 
drop- out.

Page  43 of 53 13.2 Analysis Populations  
Intent -to-Treat Population  (ITT)  
The Intent -to-Treat (ITT) population will include all subjects who are randomized. Subjects will 
be analyzed according to their  study treatment assignment, not according to the treatment 
actually received.  The ITT population will be used for evaluating primary and secondary efficacy 
endpoints  and subject characteristics.  
Per-Protocol Population (PP)  
The Per -Protocol (PP) population will include all subjects in the ITT population who comple te 
the 28- day study and have no major protocol deviations. The PP population will be used for 
primary and secondary efficacy endpoints. 
Safety Population  
The Safety population will consist of subjects who receive at least 1 dose of study medication 
(camost at mesilate or placebo). The Safety population will be used for all summaries of safety 
and tolerability data.  
13.3 Efficacy Analysis  
13.3.1 Analysis of Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The primary endpoint (the proportion of subjects requiring COVID -19 related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_855542] 28 days  of randomization ) will be analyzed using the Fisher 
exact test in ITT and PP populations. The primary endpoint will also be analyzed using the 
Mantel -Haenszel (MH) test, and the 95% Clopper -Pearson confidence interval (CI) will be 
reported. In addition, the continuity -corrected Newcombe CI  for the proportional  difference 
between treatment groups will be reported. The logistic regression model with treatment group, 
sex, race, duration of symptoms prior to enrollment , age groups (< 65 versus ≥ 65 years) and 
other risk factor s as covariates may be used to investigate the potential influences of 
demographic and baseline characteristics. The odds ratios and their 95% CIs will be estimated.  
A sensitivity analysis for the primary efficacy endpoint will be performed for central lab oratory 
confirmed COVID -19 subjects  in the ITT population. 
13.3.2 Analysis of Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
Secondary analysis include:  
• The overall survival rate (the proportion of randomized subjects who survive up to Day 15 and Day  28) 
• Time to  resolution of  fever from randomization up to Day 28  
• Time to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_855536] 28

Page  52 of 53 16.1 APPENDIX 1 -  CONTRACEPTION GUIDELINES  
Women of childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) and men whose sexual partners are WOCBP must 
use at least [ADDRESS_1191694] dose of study treatment.  
A woman is considered to be a WOCBP (fertile) following menarche and until becom ing 
postmenopausal, unless she is permanently sterile. Permanent sterilization methods include 
hysterectomy, bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656], and bilateral oophorectomy. A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical ca use. A high 
follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a 
postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy. However, in the absence of [ADDRESS_1191695] a failure rate of <1% (when 
implemented consistently a nd correctly) and include:  
• combined (containing estrogen and progestogen) hormonal contraception associated with 
inhibition of ovulation (administration  may be ora l, intravaginal, or transdermal)  
• progestogen- only hormonal contraception associated with inhibi tion of ovulation 
(administration  may be o ral, injectable, or implantable)  
• intrauterine device  
• intrauterine hormone -releasing system  
• bilateral tubal ligation or occlusion  
• vasectomy (provided that the male has a medical assessment of surgical success)  
• sexual abstinence (defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk in relation to the duration of the clinical trial, in line with the preferred and 
usual lifestyle of the subject ) 
All subjects  will be strongly advised that they (or the female partners of male s ubjects ) should 
not become pregnant while on study treatment or for the above -specified period after the last 
dose. A f emale subject  will be advised that she must report immediately to the study site for 
pregnancy testing and appropriate management in the event that she may be pregnant.

Page  53 of 53 16.2 APPENDIX 2 – GUIDELINES FOR NASAL TURBINATE SWAB COLLECTION 
PROCEDURE  
General Guidelines  
Proper collection of specimens is the most important step in the laboratory diagnosis of 
infectious diseases. A specimen that is not collected correctly may lead to false negative test 
results. The following specimen collection guidelines follow standard r ecommended 
procedures. These instructions are provided by [CONTACT_100571] ( CDC, 2020)  
A nasal mid -turbinate swab is to be collected by a healthcare provider using a flocked tapered 
swab.  Use only synthetic fiber swabs with plastic or wire shafts. Do not use calcium alginate 
swabs or swabs with wooden shafts, as they may contain substances that inactivate some viruses 
and inhibit PCR testing.  
Collecting and Handling Specimens Safely  
For pr oviders collecting specimens or within 6 feet of subjects  suspected or known to be infected 
with SARS -CoV -2, maintain proper infection control and use recommended personal protective 
equipment (PPE), which includes an N95 or higher -level respi[INVESTIGATOR_13521] (or fac emask if a respi[INVESTIGATOR_855544]), eye protection, gloves, and a gown, when collecting specimens. 
For providers who are handling specimens, but are not direc tly involved in collection ( e.g., self -
collection) and not working within [ADDRESS_1191696] p recautions; gloves are 
recommended. Healthcare personnel are recommended to wear a form of source control 
(facemask or cloth face covering) at all times while in the healthcare facility.  
Collecting Mid -turbinate Swab Specimens  
Use a fl ocked tapered swab , and grasp only the distal end of the swab handle using gloved hands . 
Tilt subject’s  head back 70 degrees. While gently rotating the swab, insert swab less than one 
inch (about 2 cm) into nostril until resistance is met at turbinates. Ro tate the swab several times 
against nasal wall. In the subject eCRF , record the subject’s nostril used for sampling. Use the 
same nostril throughout the study each time a swab specimen is collected.  
Storage  
Swabs should be placed immediately into a sterile  transport tube containing 2 to 3 mL of either 
viral transport medium (VTM), Amies transport medium, or sterile saline, unless using a test 
designed to analyze a specimen directly, ( i.e., without placement in VTM), such as some point -
of-care tests .  
Label the specimen appropriately, including the subject ID, study number, specimen type (nasal 
mid-turbinate swab sample), and date and time of collection.  
Refer to the central laboratory manual for further processing of swab samples.

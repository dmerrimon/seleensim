Genomic 
Testing (Optional): A separate blood specimen will be collected at the Bas eline Visit for genomic

This sample should be collected at the Baseline Visit prior to dosing, but may be collected at any time during the study, if necessary. Genomic testing will not be 
available to study participants in Denmark due to country -specific regulations.  
Statistical 
Methods : Determination of Sample Size  
The sample size in this study was determi ned based on number of nSEBs as the 
original primary endpoint. In the [LOCATION_006] Phase 2 study, the mean number of new BCC lesions at 6 months was 0.42 in the Patidegib  Topi[INVESTIGATOR_261060], 2%, group with 
a standard deviation (SD) of , and a mean of  in the Vehicle group with a SD of . The effect size was 0.81. It is assumed that at 6 months, the mean number of nSEBs in the Patidegib Topi[INVESTIGATOR_261060], 2%, group will be , with a SD of 0.94, while at 6 months the mean and SD in the Vehicle group will be the same as in the Phase 2 study at 6 months (see Table  4) for an e ffect size of . 
At 12 months, it is assumed that the means and SDs will be twice those observed at 6 months. With these assumptions, 63 subjects in the Pat idegib 
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_261060], 2%, group and 63 in the Vehicle group (for a total of 126 subjects) will give  >90% power for a two- sided 0.05 level statistical significance. To 
account for a 16% drop-out rate, approximately   subjects will be 
randomized. Sample size  was calculated based on a Wilcoxon -Mann -Whitney 
test, which is conservative if the underlying di stribution is Negative Binomial.  
Given the change in primary endpoint requested by [CONTACT_1622], it is acknowledged that the power for statistical significance in new BCCs may be different than what was projected before the initiation of the study, and based on nSEBs. We can however state that i f the drug effect on new BCCs is the same proportion to 
its vehicle mean as is  the drug effect on nSEBs to its vehicle mean , and if the 
coefficient of variations of new BCCs and nSEBs are similar, then the new BCC 
primary endpoint will have the same power as does nSEBs. 
 
Statistical Analysis  
The primary population for efficacy analyses will be the Intent- to-Treat (ITT) 
populat ion, with the per -protocol (PP) population for supportive ana lyses. The

Phase [ADDRESS_1273588] that develop over  
12 months. This endpoint will be analyzed using a negative binomial regression 
to compare treatment grou ps with  number of BCCs at Baseline, Age  
years), gender, prior HHI therapy, and geographic region as covariates. 
Secondary endpoints that are based on number of new BCCs  or nSEBs will be 
analyzed similar  to the primary endpoint . This includes the  proportion of 
subjects with at least two  new facial BCCs and the proportion of subjects with at 
least one new facial BCC.  
The primary method of dealing with missing data will be the multiple imputation method. Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) and observed case analyses will be done as sensitivity analyses.  
 
Safety endpoints will be summarized with means and standard errors, or 
proportions.

PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL   Page 15 of 73 4 INTRODUCTION  
Basal cell carcinomas (BCC) are slow growing tumors of the skin. They c an be sporadic or 
inherited. B asal cell nevus (Gorlin) syndrome ( ]1) (BCNS)  is a rare autosomal 
dominant heritable  disease characterized by [CONTACT_907269], most prominent 
among which is the de velopment of numerous BCCs over a l ifetime. Reports of its prevalence 
vary; the highest estimate is . The burden of BCCs varies among Gorlin Syndrome 
patients. In general, Gorlin Syndrome patients have their BCCs treated as they become 
problematic (i.e., at risk of invasion of vital structures such as eyes, nose, or ears ), large enough 
that scarring will be particularly noticeable if treatment is delayed,  or larg e enough off the face 
such that they are uncomfortable, bleed).  
Several topi[INVESTIGATOR_897] -applied drugs (e.g., imiquimod and 5 -fluoruracil) are used in the treatment of 
sporadic BCCs. Both of these can cure approximately  of the superficial subtype of BCCs, 
which generally occur off the face. However, they generally are not useful for nodular BCCs, 
which are the more prevalent subtype, especially on the face. Surgery  is the definitive treatment 
of choice for BCC which are refractory to other interventions.  
Prevention of BCCs so far has been limited to admonitions to avoid sunlight, advice which i s 
followed infrequently by [CONTACT_907270][INVESTIGATOR_907248], and which has not 
been shown to produce a statistically significant reduction in BCC inc idence.  
In 1996, two groups identified the PTCH1 gene as the locus of the mutations that cause Gorlin 
Syndrome.2-[ADDRESS_1273597] one defective heritable copy of this gene, and 
sporadic loss of the second allele is crucial to the develo pment of all of their BCCs . The PTCH1 
gene encodes the primary inhibitor of the hedgehog (HH) signaling pathway, and its function is to inhibit signaling by [CONTACT_103680] “downstream” member of the HH pathway –  
(SMO).  All Gorlin Syndrome BCCs , unlike sporadic BCCs, thus far analyzed  have loss of 
PTCH1 with out activating mutations of SMO.
[ADDRESS_1273598] been developed for oral treatment of BCCs. T wo of these – 
vismodegib and sonidegib – have been approved for systemic treatment of advanced BCCs. The 
latter are defined as BCCs whose surgical excision likely would produc e unsatisfactory results 
(i.e., “locally advanced”) or those which have become metastatic
6. Approximately 50% of such 
BCCs fail to respond initially, frequently due to mutations in the SMOOTHENED gene, which encodes the pr otein to which these drugs bind. Of those that do respond, a significant proportion

Phase [ADDRESS_1273599]/ all of the 
clinically and histologically c leared BCCs recur to the same size as before treatment .
8 Adverse 
events (AEs)  seen with systemic hedgehog inhibitor ( HHI) include muscle spasms, alopecia, 
dysgeusia, nausea, fatigue, weight loss, diarrhoea and decreased appet ite [Vismodegib and 
Sonidegib USPI].  
Patidegib is a semi -synthetic small molecule which when given orally has good therapeutic 
efficacy  for advanced BCCs but produces the same types of AEs as do other systemic HH 
inhibitors.  
PellePharm is developi[INVESTIGATOR_907249], 2%, for the reduction of BCC burden in 
subjects with Gorlin Syndrome. Patidegib Topi[INVESTIGATOR_261060], 2%, is manufactured with excipi[INVESTIGATOR_907250], is  stable in the developed gel formulation, and can be applied to mini-
pig skin without irritation.  Application of Patidegib Topi[INVESTIGATOR_261060], 2%, significantly reduces 
murine BCC tumor size in vivo and reduces GLI1 biomarker expression in vitro in human BCC 
tumor explants.

in patients with Gorlin syndrome; and US dose escalating study  for sporadic BCCs).

PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL   Page 19 of 73 6 OVERALL STUDY DESIGN AND PLAN  
This is a global, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, stratified, ve hicle -controlled study of the 
efficacy and safety of Patidegib Topi[INVESTIGATOR_261060], 2%, applied topi[INVESTIGATOR_907254] . Subjects will be required to apply the IP for [ADDRESS_1273601] 12 months duration 
following the end of this study. All subjects who complete the Month 12/Exit Visit having demonstrated adequate compliance with application of the IP without major Protocol Deviations (PDs) during the study will be eligible for participation in the extension study.  
The principal investigator (PI) or designee will be responsib le for the oversight of the study at 
their clinical trial site.   
6.1 Rationale for S tudy D esign  
The key el ements of the study design are choice of the primary endpoint, stratification, eligibility 
criteria , disease severity , a relatively longer treatment duration (12 months ) than that in the 
Phase 2 Gorlin Syndrome study (treatment duration 6 months), the methodology for 
measurement of BCCs, and the use of imaging to track BCCs .  
 Choice of Primary E ndpoint  
The primary endpoint of the study is a comparison between treatment arms of  the number of new 
BCCs  per subject that develop over the 12 month period. BCC s urgery has signi ficant morbidity 
(e.g., scarring, functional loss of eyelid, nose, ear) and most BCCs in patients with Gorlin 
syndrome are ultimately removed by [CONTACT_44850].  Reduction in the number of facial BCCs and in the number of resulting BCC surgeries are serious u nmet medical needs and the number of BCCs 
and number of nSEBs are therefore cons idered appropriate correlating study endpoints.  
Generally , a facial BCC of longest diameter  is considered a SEB .[ADDRESS_1273602] B aseline the BCC was  either surgically removed because of the developm ent of possible 
functional facial/health impairment, as determined by [CONTACT_907271] (irrespective of whether or not it was surgically removed). These obj ective criteria are 
that post B aseline, the BCC has a longest diamete r  mm in longest 
diameter from Baseline.  
 Stratification  Parameters 
The study design incorporates stratification to ensure that potential Baseline confounders of 
efficacy are distributed evenly across treatment arms. The assignment of subjects into the study is being stratified based on Gender, Age and previous HHI therapy.  

PellePharm, I nc. 
Phase [ADDRESS_1273603] s with Gorlin Syndrome , the rate of  development of nSEBs was lower 
after vismodegib was discontin ued ( ) than it had been during placebo 
treatment prior to vismodegib treatment ( ).[ADDRESS_1273604] s from a natural history study .10 Age is therefore a stratification factor 
to avoid confounding age- related rates of Baseline tumor progression across treatment groups.  
 Treatment Duration 
The duration of treatment in the phase 2 [LOCATION_006] study in Gorlin Syndrome patients (Pelle -926-201) 
was [ADDRESS_1273605] the PI [INVESTIGATOR_907255] . This is accomplished by [CONTACT_907272]  (unmarked). M arked (annotated) 
images will also b e collected in addition to unmarked images at prespecified visits (see Table  1). 
Pelle -926-201 also included imaging to track BCCs.   
At visits prior to IP application (i.e., Screening and Baseline), a second set of digital images 
(annotated images) w ill be captured, after the BCCs on the face have been identified, labeled, 
and numbered for tracking purposes. I t is possible that in some instances at Screening and/or 
Baseline all BCCs cannot be tracked (labeled and numbered ) due to limited space for stickering 
on the face. In such situations, the BCCs will be tracked in order of decreasing (longest) BCC diameter. It is of critical importance that all SEBs are identified in the images.   
At prespecified post-B aseline visits, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_907256] B CCs for a second set of 
(marked) images. For a given subject, each BCC will be given the same tracking number as 

PellePharm, I nc. 
Phase [ADDRESS_1273606]-B aseline visits, the Investigator will identify (label and number) all BCCs 
that were tracked prior to IP application start and will identify any new BCCs that have appeared 
since start of IP application . At these pre-specified post-B aseline visits , the Investigator will 
review the BCCs and identify BCCs that may be approximately ) in 
size. The Investigator will measure the longest diameter for these BCCs, identify them as new or 
previously existing SEBs, and flag them on the label. Throughout the study for any given subject  
each BCC will have the same number .  
Qualified, trained, and blinded Image Data Quality  Reviewer  (s) will examine each set of subject 
images (1) to determine t he accuracy of mappi[INVESTIGATOR_907257], and (2) to rule out wild 
transcription  or transposition reporting errors in  BCC diameter . The I mage Data Quality  
Reviewer  (s) may query the Investigator, as appropriate. The Investigator may review the query 
and correct , as appropriate. The Investigator’s decision of the BCC diameter and surgical 
eligibility is final.  
 Eligibility Criteria and Disea se Severity   
Patidegib topi[INVESTIGATOR_907258] s with Gorlin Syndrome . Gorlin Syndrome is 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_907259], based on the major and minor diagnostic criteria which are 
reflected in the inclusion criteria6.  
The protocol requires that the subject must have had at least 10 ( with at least 3 on the face) 
clinically typi[INVESTIGATOR_907243] 24  months prior to Randomization (Baseline/Day  1). This 
is to ensure that subject s with moderate to severe Gorlin Syndrome who are most likely to 
benefit from treatment are enrolled.  
Additionally the subject must have at least [ADDRESS_1273607] diameter <5 mm present on the 
face prior to Randomization (Baseline/Day  1). This increases the possibility for developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a 
nSEB during the study.  
6.2 Dose R ationale 
The PK data from the [LOCATION_006] Phase 2 Proof- of-Concept (Pelle -926-201) study showed 1/6 subjects

PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL   Page 27 of 73 8 STUDY PROCEDURES AND ASSESSMENTS  
The study will be conducted as outlined in the schedule of as sessments ( SoA) ( Table  1). All 
study visits will take place in person at the study site/clinic, except for the [ADDRESS_1273617] infor mation a nd data obtained during the study 
visits will be recorded in the source documents, applicable study logs, and electronic case report 
forms  (eCRFs ), as appropriate. 
Investigators (and any designee) must have appropriate, documented experience and training, or 
obtain approval from PellePharm based on experience (or through additional training organized and provided by [CONTACT_907267] [or designee]). Sites will undergo a feasibility assessment, and a formal Pre -Trial Visit (PTV) conducted by [CONTACT_907274] ( CRO) (or 
designee). Sites that meet the requirements to conduct a study according to Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ) and applicable local and country regulatory requirements, as well as Investigator 
and site personnel with demonstrated experience and qualifications will be approved by [CONTACT_907275]. The CRO will continue the site activation process 
to assist sites to receive IRB approval and IP shipment and conduct of a Trial Initiation Visit 
(TIV) prior to the enrollment of subjects into the study for each site. In addition, at least one and 
preferably two site personnel will be trained in the image capture method by [CONTACT_907276]. A  back -up image capture site staff member should be 
available as needed.  
At each study visit, every attempt should be made to ensure that the same Investigator assesses 
the same subject. PellePharm realizes that the conduct of a clinical trial involves a t eam of study 
staff who perfo rm a variety of functions under the supervision of the PI. Tasks and 
responsibilities are delegated by [CONTACT_978], and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_907262]- site 
personnel. There are specific tasks that PellePharm requires be done by a licensed physician with appropriate experience. As outlined below and in the SoA ( Table  1), these tasks include SEB 
biopsy procedure, assessment and reporting, BCC measurement and assessment, and recording application site reactions.  The surgical excision of the BCC may be done by [CONTACT_907277] a licensed physician with appropriate experience.  
PellePharm also realizes that scheduling visits can be challenging and has allowed for flexibility 
with study visit days . It should be noted that the indicated visit day is in reference to the Baseline 
Visit. For example , the Month [ADDRESS_1273618] no more than 45 days after the 
Screening visit. If this period exceeds 45 days, subjects will need to be re- screened.

Pelle -926-301 , Protocol Amendment 3, 04JAN2021 
PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL   Page 28 of 73 The assessments/procedures to be performed at the different visits are elaborated here.  
 Informed C onsent  
All subjects must provide written informed consent before any study related procedures are 
performed. Each subject will receive a copy of the signed consent form.  Subjects may be pre-
screened (chart review , etc.) for eligibility prior to any  study related proc edure.  
 Inclusion and Exclusion 
Following provision of informed consent from each subject, the Investigator will determine whether subjects meet the inclusion/e xclusion criteria .  
A WOCBP is defined as a woman who (a) has not undergone hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy or (b) has not been naturally post-menopausal for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had no menses in the 24 preceding months).  
A WOCBP may be enrolled if she agrees to complete abstinence from sexual intercour se or the 
couple agrees to use at least 2 forms of birth control as defined by [CONTACT_2224] a condom with 
spermicide in association with one of the following: bilateral tubal ligation, combined oral contraceptives (estrogens and progesterone), or implanted or injectable contra ceptives with a 
stable dose for at least 1 month prior to the Baseline Visit, or hormonal intra -uterine device 
(IUD) inserted at least [ADDRESS_1273619]'s date/year  of birth, gender at birth , race and ethnicity will be recorded in the eCRF , 
where allowed by [CONTACT_907278]. Race and ethnicity will not be col lected in 
countries where prohibited. 
 Medical History  
Subjects’ relevant family history of Gorlin Syndrome and medical history pertinent to eligibility criteria will be collected . Information about medical conditions that resolved 2 or more years 
prior to Screening do not need to be recorded unless considered relevant by [CONTACT_737]. 
 Prior and C oncomitant Medications 
Prior and concomitant m edications will be captured separately for BCC  (facial) and other 
indication s.  
All medications ongoing in the [ADDRESS_1273620] will apply the IP at the study site under the direction of the 
Study Coordinator (or designee). The IP should be applied after all clinical assessments. Additional information on IP application is available in  Section 10.4.  
 Compliance  
The site pharmacist (or designated site personnel) will collect and weigh the previously dispensed IP tubes to assess compliance with IP dosing for the preceding month. The weight of the IP tubes will be recorded on the appropriate eCRF. See Section 9.[ADDRESS_1273621] to their primary care physician and/or th eir PSCP. Data collected will be  reported in the ‘Unscheduled 
Visit’ eCRF page.

The safety assessments in the study include vital signs, AEs, dermal safety , and laboratory 
assessments (Section 11.1).  
 Dermal Safety and T olerability  Events  
Safety and tolerability will be evaluated through assessment of selected local signs and 
symptoms (pain/burning, pruritus, erythema, edema, and crusting) on the face. Any local skin 
reaction that requires use of a concomitant therapy  or causes interruption or discontinuation 
of the IP should be reported as a dermal safety event . These events will be assessed for 
severity, relative to the skin reactions scale ( Table  2).

 Physical E xamination and Vital Signs  
Physical examinations (PEs) including v ital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], 
and temperature) will be collected and reported. He ight will be collected at the Baseline Visit 
only. C linically significant changes from B aseline will be captured as AEs. Changes in BCC  
measurements and BCC count will be captured separately as efficacy (imaging and tracking) 
assessments and not as a PE as sessment. Changes in BCC count or size will not constit ute 
AEs.  
PEs are also done at quarterly visits. Additional PEs at other visits  may be collected 
according to any signs/symptoms and/or positive findings at previous PE.  
 Laboratory A ssessments  
Routine safety laboratory tests (complete blood count/differential, urinalysis, and serum chemistry) will be performed as per the SoA (Table  1) and Appendix 17.1. Any out-of- range 
laboratory result that is considered clinically significant by [CONTACT_907280]. Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities at any visit will be followed to resolution (return to normal or to the Ba seline state) or until clinically stable as determined by [CONTACT_907281] .  
 Pregnancy T ests 
All WOCBP will have a serum pregnancy test as per the SoA (Table  1), and serum or urine 
pregnancy tests at all other study visits. If the WOCBP becomes pregnant during the course of the study, she must immediately stop applying the IP and report the finding to the Investigator. Potential teratogenicity should be discussed at each visit with  WOCBP and with 
male subjects with partners who are WOCBP.  
8.4 Other A ssessments  
 PK A ssessments  
A plasma sample will be collected prior to application of IP per the SoA  (Table  1). At 
Baseline, PK samples will be collected prior to the first dose and the date and time of the first dose will be recorded. Post -Baseline, the date and time of the last dose prior to collection of 
the PK sample must be recorded.

Upon enrollment and randomization of a subject, the pharmacist (or designee) will s elect the 
IP kit based on the randomization number provided by [CONTACT_907282]/Phone Randomization System ( IxRS ). The initial application of the IP will take place in the clinic 
under observation. No other IP applications at subsequent visit s will be required to be 
observed in the clinic setting. However, where it is suspected that inappropriate amounts of IP are being applied by [CONTACT_423]  (based on tube weights) further review of IP application in 
the clinic may be warranted.  
The subject will return  all IP gel tube s (used , partially used, and/or unused) at their 
subsequent study visit. If any IP gel tubes are lost or damaged between clinic visits, 
additional IP may be provided to the subject. The goal is to ensure that the subject has an 
adequate sup ply of IP to  be able to administer all scheduled treatments.  
Refer to the Pharmacy Manual for additional details about administration requirements, IP 
supply, and accountability procedures.

be applied to the face , which will be defined as the area extending from the anterior hairline 
to the jaw line (except the eyelids) including the  ears. If the anterior hairline is receding, 
application of  IP to  the forehead will extend no more than [ADDRESS_1273631] on the proper use of laminated 
dosing cards during the Baseline V isit. In addition to the verbal ins tructions given during the 
visit, written and/or other media IP application instructions may be provided to the subjects. 
Subjects should be encouraged to keep facial hair short enough to allow adequate application 
of IP to the face , and subjects must remove make- up prior to IP application . 
Subjects will be instructed to wash their face and hands within approximately [ADDRESS_1273632] ( ), avoiding the eyelids (as described 
above and in the Pharmacy Manual). If no observable AEs  are noted within a  
observation period after their first application, subjects can leave the site.  Subjects will be 
advised to minimize exposure to direct sunlight while in the study and to wash their hands 
before and after application of the IP . 
 
. If an IP application has been missed or delayed such that there would be 
 between applications, the subject should not apply that dose of IP and just wait to 
apply the next dose. Th e importance of IP compliance should be discussed with the subject 
during each site visit.  
Subjects will be instructed to store their IP in a secure location away from children. WOCBP  
should not come in contact [CONTACT_907283]. The amount of IP used by [CONTACT_907284].  If it is suspected that inappropriate amounts of IP are being 
applied by [CONTACT_423] (based on tube weights) further review of IP application in the clini c 
may be warranted.  
10.[ADDRESS_1273633]  Accountability  and Disposal  
Upon receipt of the IP , the Investigator (or designee, e.g., study center pharmacist) will 
acknowledge receipt of the IP after reviewing the shipment’s content and condition. The 
Inves tigator (or designee) is responsible for ensuring that the designated study site staff 
conduct a complete inventory of study materials and assume responsibility for their storage and dispensing. The Investigator (or designee)  must agree to keep all study materials in a 
secure location with restricted access. The Investigator (or designee) will keep a record of the inventory and dispensing of a ll IPs . This record will be made available to the Study Monitor 
for the purpose of accounting for al l clinical supplies. Any significant discrepancy and/or 
deficiency must be recorded with an explanation. 
All supplies sent to the investigators will be accounted for and, in no case, used in any 
unauthorized situation. Each tube of IP adminis tered at the s tudy center will be administered 
by [CONTACT_347103]. At each site visit, IP compliance will be discussed with the 
subject. At the end of the study, following final IP inventory reconciliation by [CONTACT_2037], the study 
site will dispose of and/or destroy all supplies (including used, partially used, and/or un used 
tubes of IP ) where possible, in compliance with the site’s SOP s for IP disposal/destruction.  In 
the event that the site is unable to dispose of and/or destroy IP sup plies, the Sponsor w ill be 
notified and a third-party vendor may be contracted to manage destruction of IP supplies.

Phase [ADDRESS_1273634] a causal relationship with the medicinal (investigational) product . AEs include any unfavorable and unintended illness, sign ( e.g., including an 
abnormal laboratory finding) , symptom, clinically significant laboratory test abnormality, or 
disease associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product that has  appeared or 
worsened du ring the course of the clinical trial, regardless of causal relationship to the 
medicinal (investigational) product under study.  
Subjects will be questioned about any concurrent illness or systemic sign or symptom. Any 
incidence of  these systemic signs or  symptoms will be reported on the AE eCRF. 
Vital signs and laboratory abnormalities are to be recorded as AEs only if they are clinically significant (for example: are symptomatic, requiring corrective treatment, leading to discontinuation or fulfilling a seriousness criterion).  A laboratory abnormality that is part of 
an efficacy endpoint (e.g., histologic confirmation of BCC on a biopsy) is not to be reported 
as an AE.  
An unexpected AE is one that is not listed in the Investigator’ s Brochure (IB) or is no t listed 
at the specificity or severity that has been observed.  
 Documenting Adverse Events  
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to document in the eCRF all AEs /SAEs  that occur 
during the course of the study. AEs /SAEs  should be collected after the i nformed consent 
form is signed and usually at the Screening visit. T he AEs /SAEs  should be documented as a 
single medical diagnosis. When this is not possible, the AE /SAEs  should be documented in 
terms of signs and/or symptoms observed by [CONTACT_907285].  
All AEs /SAEs  occurring after the  subject signs the informed consent through the last study 
visit must be reported, regardless of whether or not t he AEs /SAEs  are considered drug -
related. A ll AEs /SAEs , whether in response to a query, observed by [CONTACT_3991], 
or reported spontaneously by [CONTACT_423], will be recorded. 
At each visit during the study, the subject will be assessed for the occurrence of new and 
ongoing AEs. Dermal safety and tolerability that res ult in the subject requiring a concomitant 
therapy or discontinuation from the study will be reported as an AE /SAE . The following data 
will be collected on all AEs and recorded on the appropriate e CRF:

In addition, the Investigator’s assessment of causality will be recorded   
It is not necessary to capture multiple occurrences of an AE  separately if the event recurs at 
short intervals. In such instances the end date of the AE is the date when the event resolved

of SAEs under Section  11.1.6. Pregnancy in and of itself is not an SAE, but a subject who 
becomes pregnant must discontinue IP application immediately and the pregnancy will be 
followed to term (and ideally the child will be followed afterward if the subject consents) or termination . Any birth defect or other serious issue that may arise during the pregnancy or 
due to fetal exposur e will be considered an SAE.   
 Assessment of Severity  
The severity assigned to an AE should be determined by [CONTACT_85210]. The categories described below should be used to estimate the severity  of AEs:  
• Mild: Transient or mild discomfort; n o limitation in activity; no medical 
intervention/therapy required  
• Moderate:  Mild to moderate limitation in activi ty; some assistance may be 
needed; no or minimal medical intervention/therapy required  
• Severe:  Marked limitation in activity; some assistance usually required; medical 
intervention/therapy required; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_85153]; may be incapacitating or life threatening  
 Assessment of Causality  
The Investigator should assess the relationship of the AE, if an y, to the IP. The following 
should be taken into account when assessing SAE causality: 
• Positive temporal relations hip to IP , such as if the IP  was discontinued and the 
SAE resolved or the event recurred after re -introduction. 
• If there is a reasonable possibility that the AE is associated with an underlying or 
concomitant illness.  
• Possible association with previous or concomitant therapy. 
• No temporal relationship to the IP  and/or a more likely alternative etiology exists.  
• If the AE is directly related to study procedures or a lack of efficacy.  
The following classifications should be used when evaluating the relationship of AEs and 
SAEs to the investigational drug. 
1. Not Related : No relationship between the experience and the administration of IP; 
related to other etiologies such as concomitant medications or subject’s clinical state.  
2. Unlikely : The current state of knowledge indicates that a relationship is unlikely.

PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL   Page 46 of 73 3. Possibly : A reaction that follows a plausible temporal sequence from administration of 
the IP  and follows a known response pattern to the suspected IP. The reaction might have 
been produced by [CONTACT_423]’s cli nical state or other modes of therapy administered to 
the subject . 
4. Probably:  A reaction that follows a plausible temporal sequence from administration of 
the IP  and follows a known response pattern to the suspected IP. The reaction cannot be 
reasonably exp lained by [CONTACT_20612]’s clinical state or other 
modes of therapy administered to the subject. 
5. Definitely : A reaction that follows a plausible temporal sequence from administration of 
the IP  and follows a known response pattern to the suspected IP  and can be confirmed 
with a positive re-challenge test or supporting laboratory data. 
 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events 
SAE s will be captured in both the clinical and safety database.  
All SAEs, regardless of cause or relationship, th at occurs after the subject first consents to 
participate in the study (i.e., signs the informed consent) and throughout the duration of the 
study and for [ADDRESS_1273636] IP application will be captured in the clinical database via the eCRFs (Se ction  11.1.2).  
SAEs also will be captured i n the safety database. An initial SAE Report must be completed 
for all SAEs (irrespective of relatedness) with an onset date within [ADDRESS_1273637] also be completed for Related SAEs 
(possibly, probably or definitely) regardless of the time elapsed from the last dose (even if the study has been closed). 
When new, significant information for an SAE is obtain ed, as well as when the outcome of 
an SAE is known, the Investigator must submit a Follow-Up Report. If the subject was 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], a copy of the discharge summary must be included as part of the subject’s 
medical file.  For related events,  the Investigator should monitor the subject until the outcome 
of the SAE is known. This may require periodic Follow-Up Reports. 
PellePharm and the study CRO must be notified of all SAEs (regardless of ca usal 
relationship to IP) within 24 hours of the Inve stigator’s knowledge of the event by [CONTACT_907286] a completed SAE report to the CRO Medical Monitor.  
If there are serious, unexpect ed AEs associated with the use of the IP, PellePharm (or 
designee) will notify the appropriate regulatory agency(ies) and all appropriate parties  as 
appropriate (e .g., IRB)  on an expedited basis. It is the responsibility of the Investigator to 
promptly notify the IRB/IEC of all unexpected SAEs involving risk to human subjects.

 Expedited Serious Adverse Event Reports 
An AE, whether serious or non-serious, is designated unexpected if it is not reported in the 
reference safety section of the IB  or if the event is of greater frequency, specificity or 
severity  than so reported. 
PellePha rm will notify regulatory authorities of unexpected related S AEs and all 
participating study sites in writing for submission by [CONTACT_26492]/IEC. This notification will be in the form of a Safety Update to the IB  (i.e., “15- day letter”).  
Upon receiving such notices, the Investigator must review and retain the notice with the IB 
and immediately submit a copy of this information to the responsible IRB/IEC , according to 
local regulations. The Investigator and IRB/IEC wi ll determine if the informed consent 
requires revision. The Investigator should also comply with the IRB/IEC procedures for 
reporting any other safety information.

12.6.1 Efficacy Summaries  
The efficacy endpoints are intended to com pare twice daily ap plication of Patidegib Topi[INVESTIGATOR_907253], 2%, and Vehicle. Efficacy assessments will be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_907290]. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoint is the number of new BCCs per subject by [CONTACT_43380] 12.  
 
 [IP_ADDRESS] Secondary Endpoints  
The secondary efficacy endpoint s are:  
1. The number of nSEBs per subje ct by [CONTACT_43380] 12. 
2. The proportion of subjects developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] ≥2 facial new BCCs  by [CONTACT_43380] 12.

6. aBCCdex  change in Lesion S ymptoms scale score from Baseline to Month 12.  
 
An nSEB is a histologically verified BCC that was surgically removed because of possible 
functional facial/health impairment as determined by [CONTACT_737]. 
Also, nSEBs are facial BCCs with a longe st diameter of   that:  
a. were not  surgically eligible BCCs (SEBs)  at Baseline,  
b. have grown by  [CONTACT_907291], and  
c. have been verified histologically . 
 
  [IP_ADDRESS] Exploratory Endpoints  
The exploratory endpoint s are:  
1. The proportion of SEBs that undergo clinical resolution at Month  12.  
2. The number of BCC surgeries from Baseline to Month 12.
 
3. Change in aBCCdex Worry About Future Lesions scale score from Baseline to Month 12.  
4. Change in aBCCdex Mental Health scale score from Baseline to Month 12.  
5. Change in aBCCdex Social/Relationships scale score from Baseline to Month 12.  
6. Change in aBCCdex Life Impact scale score from Baseline to Month 12.  
 

PellePharm, Inc.  
Phase [ADDRESS_1273640] that develop from baseline to  
Month 12. The number of new BCCs that develop from Baseline to Month 12 will be 
analyzed using a negative binomial regression to compare treatment groups with number of BCCs at Baseline, Age ), gender, prior HHI therapy, and geographic 
region str ata (North America, Europe) as covariates. PROC GENMOD of SAS will be used 
with distribution=Negbin . 
In or der to assess the impact of parametric assumptions, a  non- parametric rank analysis of 
covariance (ANCOVA, Stokes et al) will be provided as a sensitivity analysis with number of 
BCCs at Baseline, prior HHI therapy, gender, age ), and geographic 
region as covariates.   
The Negative Binomial regression  was selected as the primary method of analysis to account 
for the potential for over dispersion. Using the Negative Binomial model, the power will be 
somewhat higher than the one calcu lated using a non- parametric Wilcoxon -Mann -Whitney 
test. The proposed sensitivity  analysis , Rank ANCOVA, was selected to corroborate the 
results from the Neg ative Binomial model. If the distribution is markedly  different from 
Negative Binomial (and unknown to sufficiently allow a different parametric regression 
model), then the non-parametric ANCOVA gives type- 1 error close r to the nominal level. 
The number of  nSEBs that develop from Baseline to Month 12 will be analyzed using a 
Negative Binomial regression  to compare treatment groups with number of BCCs at 
Baseline, Age  ), gender, prior HHI therapy, and geographic region as 
covariates. Secondary endpoints that are based on number of new B CCs will be analyzed 
similar to the primary endpoint. The proportion of subjects with at least two new B CCs 
lesions and the proportion of subjects with at least one n ew B CC lesion will be analyzed 
using a logi stic regression to compare treatment groups with number of BCCs at Baseline, 
Age ), Gender, and prior HHI therapy and geographic region as covariates. 
Change in aBCCdex will be analyzed using an ANCOVA model with treatment group as a 
main effect, Baseline aBCCdex, prior HHI therapy, gender, a ge strata , and geographic region 
as covariates.  Testing of secondary endpoints will be done sequentially at a two-sided 0.[ADDRESS_1273641] errors, or proportions. Treatment-
emergent AEs (TEAEs) will be coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA) . Previous and Concomitant drugs will be coded using the WHO-Drug dictionary. 
12.7.1 Dermal  Safety and Tolerability 
The frequency of dermal safety and tolerability assessments including pain/burning, pruritus, 
erythema, and edema will  be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_6982]. 
12.7.2 Adverse Events  
Subjects will be assessed for the occurrence of new and ongoing AEs. Descriptions of AEs 
will include the dates of onset and resolution (if resolved), maximum severity, seriousness, action taken regarding the IP, corrective treatment, outcome, and Investig ator’s assessment of 
causality. All AEs will be recorded and classified using terminology from the MedDRA. All reported TEAEs, defined as any AE with an onset on or after the date of first IP  application, 
or worsening of an AE with an onset prior to first IP application, will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570], the number of subjects reporting TEAEs, system organ class, preferred 
term, severity, and relationship to IP . When summarizing TEAEs by [CONTACT_907292] , each subject will be counted only once within a system organ class or a preferred term 
using the event with the greatest severity or causality, respectively, within each category. All 
reported SAEs will be summarize d by [CONTACT_1570], the number of subjects reporting 
SAEs, system organ class, preferred term, severity, and relationship to IP . 
All information pertaining to AEs noted during the study will be listed by [CONTACT_249274] a verbatim description of the event as reported by [CONTACT_737] , as well as the 
preferred term,  system organ class, start date, stop date (if stopped), seriousness, severity, 
action taken regarding the IP, corrective treatment, outcome and relationship to the IP . In 
addition, a listing of subjects who prematurely discontinue from the study due to AE s will be 
provided as well as a listing of subjects who reported an SAE. 
12.7.[ADDRESS_1273642] results collected at Screening  to Baseline (Day 1) and at Months 1, 3, 6, 9, and 
Month 12/ Exit Visit. Normal ranges established by [CONTACT_141428] l laboratory will be used to 
determine the shifts. A listing of all out-of- range laboratory test results at any assessment 
PellePharm, Inc.  
Phase [ADDRESS_1273643] results will be presented in a data listing.  
12.7.6 Handling of Missing Data  
The primary m ethod for dealing with missing data will be the MI method. The MI model will 
be detailed in the SAP. One hundred imputations will be generated using PROC MI of SAS. Fully Conditional Specification (FCS) model will be used with either new BCCs or nSEBs at prior post- Baseline visits, treatment group, number of BCCs  at Baseline, prior HHI therapy, 
gender, age strata, and geographic region as covariates to impute the data. The seed to be 
used is 20180330. The results of the 100 analyses will be transformed into a normal statistic and combined into a single analysis using PROC MIANALYZE. 
LOCF and observed case analyses will be done as sensitivity analyses.  
12.7.7 Multicenter Issues  
For the purpose of the summaries and analyses, the term ‘Center’ will be used to define each 
study site. All data collected from participating Centers will be monitored and reviewed as specified in this protocol.  
Approximately 50 Center s are planned in this study to enable a sufficient number of subjects 
to be enrolled . In the event that a  Center has low numbers of subjects enrolled, pooling of 
results for C enters may be performed. The algorithm for pooling of C enters will be described 
in the SAP . Descriptive summary statistics will be generated including Center and pooled-
Center (when appropriate) by [CONTACT_907293].  
12.7.8 Multiplicity Issues  
Testing of secondary endpoints will be done sequentially at a two- sided 0.05 level.

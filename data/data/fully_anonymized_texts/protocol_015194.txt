 PROTOCOL SUMMARY  
Study Title  
Evaluation of the Safety, Tolerability, Effica cy and Activity of AMX0035, a Fixed Combination 
of Phenylbutyrate (PB) and Tauroursodeoxycholic Acid (TUDCA), for Treatment of 
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)  
 
Version Number  
4.0 
 
Study Indication  
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)  
 
Phase of Developme nt 
II 
 
Rationale for the Study  
The objective of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of  AMX0035 in subject s with 
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). ALS is a progressive  neurodegenerative disease for which 
there is no cure. There are only tw o medi cations  approved  specifi cally for treating ALS .  This 
includes  Rilutek (riluzole), which only provides a modest benefit for  subject s, and Radicava 
(edar avone) . ALS also exacts a significant economic burden.  
 
AMX0035 has demonstrated efficacy in model s of neurodegeneration, classical activation of 
neuroinflammation, and bioenergetics deficits.  The individual components of AMX0035, PB and 
TUDCA have demonstrated efficacy in in vivo  models of ALS, Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, 
ischemia, and many others. Each  individual  component has also been tested in small clinical 
trials of ALS subject s and was found to be  safe and well-tolerated, and hit primary endpoints of 
efficacy.  
 
The first trial under this IND will be a randomized double -blind placebo -controlled Pha se II trial  
to evaluate the safety and efficacy of AMX0035 for treatment of ALS. The program is  designed 
to demonstrate that treatment  is safe,  can slow the decline in function, muscle strength, and  vital 
capacity, and to assess the impact of AMX0035 thera py on biomarkers of ALS including  blood 
levels of phosphorylated axonal neurofilament H subunit and [ADDRESS_681256]  populatio n. 
 
Study Design  
This is a multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled 28-week study evaluating 
the safety, tolerability, efficacy , pharmacokinetics  and biological activity of AMX0035 .

 Study Objectives and Endpoints  
The primary objective of the study is to assess safety , tolerability,  and efficacy  of oral  (or feeding 
tube)  administration of AMX0035 via sachet  (3g PB and 1g TUDCA)  twice daily vs. matched 
placebo administered  via sachet  twice daily.   
 
The primary outcome measure s will be: 
1. To co nfirm the safety and tolerability of AMX0035  in subject s with ALS over a 24-week  
period  
2. To measure the impact of treatment on disease progression using the slope of  the revised 
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS -R)

 2 Introduction: Background Information and Scientific Rationale  
2.[ADDRESS_681269] s in the US and an estimated 450,000 people worldwide, according to the ALS 
Association. ALS causes the progressive degeneration of motor neurons, resulting in rapi[INVESTIGATOR_524982]; on 
average, the disease is fatal within just 3-5 years. There are two  FDA -approved medication s for 
ALS, riluzole, which  only extends survival modestly , and Radicava (edaravone) .  ALS also 
exacts a significant economic burden.  
 
Although the precise cause of  ALS is unknown, ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases such 
as Alzheimer’s are strongly characterized by [CONTACT_525010]. Together these 
processes form a toxic cycle that is a key driver of progressive neurological decline. Recent 
research has highlighted mitochondrial stress and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress as key 
mediators of both the nerve cell death and neuroinflammatory processes1. The mitochondrion is 
the energy production center o f the cell, while the ER is the quality control center. These two 
organelles are in constant communication, and are in fact physically connected by a membrane, 
and their health is vital to cell survival. When either of these cellular processes go es awry, t he 
resulting stress can either kill the cell and/or create inflammation. The brain is extremely 
sensitive to both mitochondrial stress and ER stress, and both of these pathways have been 
strongly implicated in causing neurodegenerative disease. We believe that only therapeutically 
targeting both organelles simultaneously will enact a significant and lasting benefit.  
2.1.2  AMX0035 Rationale  
AMX0035 is a proprietary combination of two small molecules, phenylbutyrate (PB) and 
tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA),  designed to block neuronal death and neurotoxic 
inflammation through simultaneous inhibition of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and 
mitochondrial stress.  
 
Both PB and TUDCA have been evaluated individually in many disease -specific models of ALS 
and oth er neurodegenerative diseases, and in many nonspecific models of ER Stress and 
bioenergetic stress, respectively.  
 
PB is a pan -HDAC inhibitor and ameliorates ER stress through upregulation of the master 
chaperone regulator DJ -1 and through recruitment of other chaperone proteins2,3. The large 
increase in chaperone production reduces activation of canonical ER stress pathways, folds 
misfolded proteins, and has been sho wn to increase survival in many in vivo models including

Page 18 of 101 
 the G93A SOD1 mouse model of ALS4. Phenylbutyrate has also been effective in additional in 
vivo models of Huntington’s Disease, Alzheimer’s, and Parkinson’s5,6,7. 
 
TUDCA recovers mitochondrial bioenergetic deficits through incorporating into the 
mitochondrial membrane, reducing Bax translocation to the mitochondrial me mbrane, reducing 
mitochondrial permeability, and increasing the apoptotic threshold of the cell8. TUDCA has 
exhibited efficacy in many in vivo oxidative insult models, including mouse models of stroke, 
retinal d isease, cardiac disease, brain lipopolysaccharide insult, the MPTP mouse model of 
Parkinson’s, and ALS in vitro models of poly(GA) -induced toxicity9,10,11. 
 
Either ER stress or bioenergetic stress can result in neuronal death and a cytotoxic immune 
response. We therefore combined PB and TUDCA and have since demonstrated that they have 
synergistic efficacy when dosed in parti cular ratios. The combination of agents demonstrated a 
mathematically synergistic increase in neuronal viability in a strong oxidative insult model 
(H2O2 -mediated toxicity) by [CONTACT_525011].   
 
Cytotoxic neuroinflammation has been found to be a major par t of neurodegeneration12,13,14. 
Different ratios of AMX0035 reduced classical activation of cytotoxic cytokines and incre ased 
phagocytic cytokines in an LPS -insult, glial model of inflammation .  
2.1.[ADDRESS_681270]  was 
scheduled to receive PB at increasing dose from 9 to 21 g/day. A total of [ADDRESS_681271] s were 
recruited at 8 sites in the U S. Twenty -six subjects completed the 20 -week treatment phase. 
Histone acetylation was decreased by [CONTACT_3450] 50% in blood buffy -coat specimens at 
screening and was significant ly increased after PB administration. Blood levels of PB and the 
primary metabolite, phenylacetate, increased with dosage (Figure 1) with a  plateau between the [ADDRESS_681272] dose (9 g/day), was the most effective at increasing  histone acetylation levels in blood 
(Figure 2). Treatment  with PB did not alter blood riluzole levels. Adverse events in subject s 
taking  riluzole and NaPB together did not occur more frequently, c ompared to those on PB 
alone.

Version 6.[ADDRESS_681273] at 9 g/day. However, the author noted that in a 
study of PB in Huntington’s disease, the effects of PB on mRNA expression levels of a [ADDRESS_681274] dosages ( 4 g t.i.d.) with an inverse dose re sponse16. 
 
For the planned Phase II trial of PB in combination with TUDCA, we therefore selected a dose 
of 3 grams of PB twice a day (6 grams per day) as a target dose with the desired pharmacologic 
effect.  
 
Recently, TUDCA at 1g b.i.d. demonstrated a statistically significant slowing of ALSFRS -R 
progression rate in a year -long, multi -site, placebo -controlled clinical trial of ALS17.  In this 
proof -of-principle trial, [ADDRESS_681275] s under treatment with riluzole were randomized to 
placebo or TUDCA (1 gram b.i.d.) for 54 weeks.  The proportion of responders (defined as 
subject s with >1 5% improvement in ALSFRS -R slope ) was higher under TUDCA (87%) than 
under placebo (P =  0.021; 43%). At study end , baseline -adjusted ALSFRS -R was signiﬁcantly 
higher (P = 0.007) in TUDCA than in placebo groups. Comparison of the slopes of regression 
analysis showed slower progression in the TUDCA than in the placebo group (P < 0.01) ( Figure 
3). 
 
Figure 3 : Linear regression ana lysis of ALSFRS -R mean scores 
over time for the TUDCA (circles, slope -0.388) and placebo 
groups (triangles, slope -0.262).  
 
For the planned Phase II trial of PB in combination with TUDCA, we therefore selected a dose 
of 1 gram of TUDCA twice a day (2 gram s per day) as a target dose.  
 
Ursodiol ( UDCA ), the non -taurine conjugated form of TUDCA, was also found to be safe and 
well-tolerated in a crossover study  subjects with ALS18. Subjects who received UDCA treatmen t 
also showed significant benefit as measured by  [CONTACT_525012] .

Version 6.[ADDRESS_681276] s randomized to active therapy in the Phase II trial will receive 3g PB and 1g TUDCA 
twice a day orally  (or by [CONTACT_525013]) . AMX0035 will be presented as a [ADDRESS_681277]  interrupted treatment 
with PB at the 9 gram per day dose (i.e. a dose higher than that planned in the proposed Phase II) 
for the occurrence of edema on the foot and under the eye.  
2.1.4  Additional Previous Clinical Experience with Phenylbutyrate  
Sodium phenylbutyrate (PB) is ge nerally well tolerated. It is FDA approved for subject s with 
urea cycle disorders including deficiencies of carbamylphosphate synthetase, ornithine 
transcarbamylase, or argininosuccinic acid synthetase . It is indicated in patients with either 
neonatal -onset deficiency or late -onset disease. The usual total daily dose is 450 -600 mg/kg/day 
in patients weighing less than 20kg, or 9.9 -13.0 g/m2/day in larger patients.  Detailed information 
can be found on the package insert for PB19. 
 
Sodium phenylbutyrate is also under development as an anticancer agent. In a dose escalation 
study in subject s with refractory solid tumor malignancies doses of up to 45g/day were 
administered20. Due to dose-limiting toxicities , the study concluded that 27g/day was the 
maximally tolerated dose. Nausea, vomiting, hypocalcemia and fatigue occurred at the 36g/day 
and 45g/day doses. Gastrointestinal upset (nausea, dyspepsia and vomiting) occurred at  the 
lowest dose of 9g/day and was seen within 30 minutes of drug ingestion. However, 82% of 
subject s completed the study despi[INVESTIGATOR_524983]. Other frequently reported side effects 
include a "sweat" -like odor, usually noticeable only to the caregiv er. Mild neurotoxicity 
(confusion, lethargy) has been noted at higher doses of close to 30g/day, but resolved with dose 
reduction.  
 
A dose -escalation study of intravenous PB in subject s with myelodysplastic syndromes and acute 
myelogenous leukemia found a  maximally tolerated dose at 375 mg/kg/day (26.3g/day for a 
70kg individual) with no serious toxicities detected in subject s receiving doses between 125 and 
375 mg/kg/day (8.8 and 26.3g/day for a 70kg individual) 0. Dose -limiting toxicities (lethargy, 
confusion, slurred speech) were detected at 440 and 500 mg/kg/day PB (30.8 and 35g/day 
respectively, for a 70kg individual). Reports of edema have been blamed on the high sodium

 load associated with the drug. Phase  I/II studies in subjects with sickle cell anemia  (see table 1 
below)  and beta thalassemia report similar side effects.  
 
Another phase I study in subject s with refractory solid tumors tested IV PB doses between 150 to  
515 mg/kg/day (up to 36g/day for a 7 0kg individual) with dose -limiting toxicities (excessive 
somnolence, confusion) and electrolyte abnormalities resulting at a dose of 515 mg/kg/day (36.0 
g/day for a 70kg individual). The maximally tolerated dose of PB was determined to be 410 
mg/kg/day (28 .7 grams/day for a 70kg individual) as there were no dose -limiting toxicities at this 
dose and no subject s required dose  reductions or escalations  (see table 1).  
 
The most common side effects of PB include: menstrual irregularities, decreased ap petite, sw eat-
like body odor, and bad taste. Less common side effects include: nausea, vomiting, stomach 
upset, stomach pain, gastritis, headache , and skin rash. Rarely, cases of peptic ulcers, rectal 
bleeding, constipation, pancreatitis and renal tubular acidosis h ave been reported. 
Hypoalbuminemia, metabolic acidosis, alkalosis, hyperchloremia, hyperuricemia, hypokalemia, 
hypophosphatemia, hyperphosphatemia and hypernatremia  have been observed . At higher doses, 
some subject s experienced confusion and fatigue, both of which resolved with dose reductions. 
Rarely, the following may occur, but have not been directly linked to sodium phenylbutyrate 
therapy: anemia, leukopenia, leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, thrombocytosis, arrhythmia, 
syncope and depression.

2.1.5  Additional Previous C linical Experience with TUDCA  
Tauroursodeoxycholic acid is currently marketed in Italy under the brand name [CONTACT_525059] 
(Bruschettini S.R.L.). It is exported to China and Turkey under the brand name [CONTACT_525060]. It is 
used for the treatment of cholesterol galls tones. It has been used for the treatment of cholestatic 
liver diseases including primary cirrhosis, pediatric familial intrahepatic cholestasis and primary 
sclerosing cholangitis and cholestasis due to cystic fibrosis. To our knowledge there are no other 
off label use s of tauroursodeoxycholic acid.  
 
Ursodeoxycholic acid  (UDCA) , which is widely used in the [LOCATION_002]  for treating gallstones , 
is produced and  secreted endogenously  by [CONTACT_525015] a taurine (TUDCA)  or glycine  (GUDCA)  
conjugate. Taurine con jugation increases the solubility of UDCA by [CONTACT_525016]. 
TUDCA is taken up in the distal ileum under active transport and therefore likely has a slightly a 
longer dwell time within the intestine than UDCA which is taken up more proximally i n the 
ileum (IND 118,844).  
 
TUDCA is widely used for the dissolution of cholesterol gallstones. This generally requires long 
periods of treatment often 1 to 2 years to obtain complete dissolution (IND 118,844).  
 
Between 1997 and 2007, 898,000 Tudcabil ta blets were sold in Italy ( taken from product profile 
contained in referenced IND 118,844). There were no reported cases of toxicity related to 
Tudcabil capsules. There were no reports of overdose or drug abuse during this period. There 
were no reports rela ted to the use of pregnancy (all pregnant subjects, and those planning to 
become pregnant , are excluded from this trial ).  Common adverse events include mild abdominal 
pain and diarrhea. There are some cases of pruritus and a very limited number of cases o f 
elevated liver enzymes. It should be noted that most of the studies are conducted in subject s with 
chronic liver disease.

Version 6.[ADDRESS_681280] trouble absorbin g bile acids (e.g. ileal disease or resection).  The only known 
or theoretical drug interactions are with substances that inhibit the absorption of bile acids such 
as cholestyramine and with drugs that increase the elimination of cholesterol in the bile (T UDCA 
reduces biliary cholesterol content). Based on similar physicochemical characteristics, it is likely 
that drug toxicity  and interactions are very similar to th ose of ursodeoxycholic acid which are 
summarized below.  
 
TUDCA has been and is being evalua ted in multiple other studies as well. A  study at Columbia 
of [ADDRESS_681281] s are administered 1.75g TUDCA  
for 12 months is ongoing  (see table 2) . A study at Washington University assessing the effect of 
TUDCA o n lipid markers and ER stress has been completed in [ADDRESS_681282] s at 1.75g daily for 4 
weeks; an additional study arm in this study assessed PB at 20g/day  (see table 2) . We have 
included in the IND package a signed right to reference to the IND for  a study at Washington 
University assessing subject s with HIV receiving 1.75g daily TUDCA for 30 days .

2.1.6    Previous Clinical Experience with Ursodiol  (UDCA)  
Ursodiol therapy has not been associated with liver damage. Lithocholic acid, a naturally 
occurring bile acid, is known to be a li ver-toxic metabolite. This bile acid is formed in the gut 
from ursodiol less efficiently and in smaller amounts than that seen from chenodiol. Lithocholic 
acid is detoxified in the liver by [CONTACT_525017], although man appears to be an efficient sulfater, i t 
is possible that some subject s may have a congenital or acquired deficiency in sulfation, thereby 
[CONTACT_525018] -induced liver damage ( IND 118,844).  
 
Abnormalities in liver enzymes have not been associated with Actigall® (Ursodiol USP 
capsules) therapy and, in fact, Actigall® has been shown to decrease liver enzyme levels in liver 
disease. However, subject s given Actigall® should have SGOT (AST) and SGPT (ALT) 
 
 
AMX -0035 in ALS  
Protocol Number: AMX3500  
Version 6.[ADDRESS_681285] been shown to adsorb bile 
acids in vitro and may be expe cted to interfere with ursodiol in the same manner as the bile acid 
sequestering agents (IND 118,844). Estrogens, oral contraceptives, and clofibrate (and perhaps 
other lipid -lowering drugs) increase hepatic cholesterol secretion, and encourage cholesterol  
gallstone formation and hence may counteract the effectiveness of ursodiol.  
 
Ursodeoxycholic acid was tested in 2 -year oral carcinogenicity studies in CD -1 mice and 
Sprague -Dawley rats at daily doses of 50, 250, and 1000 mg/kg/day. It was not tumorigenic in 
mice. In the rat study, it produced statistically significant dose -related increased incidences of 
pheochromocytomas of adrenal medulla in males (p=0.014, Peto trend test) and females 
(p=0.004, Peto trend test). A [ADDRESS_681286] (IND 118,844).  
 
Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits with ursodiol doses up to [ADDRESS_681287] revealed no evidence of impaired ferti lity or harm to the fetus at 
doses of 20 - to 100 -fold the human dose in rats and at 5 -fold the human dose (highest dose 
tested) in rabbits. Studies employing [ADDRESS_681288] shown some 
reduction in fertility rate and litter siz e. (IND 118,844) There have been no adequate and well -
controlled studies of the use of ursodiol in pregnant women, but inadvertent exposure of [ADDRESS_681289] trimester of pregnancy during the Actigall 
trials led to no  evidence of effects on the fetus or newborn baby. Although it seems unlikely, the 
possibility that ursodiol can cause fetal harm cannot be ruled out; hence, the drug is not 
recommended for use during pregnancy.  
 
2.[ADDRESS_681290] s with 
urea cycle disorders.  Refer to the phenylbutyrate tablet label (Buphenyl®) . 
 
In female subject s, the most common clinical adverse event reported w as amenorrhea/menstrual 
dysfunction (irregular menstrual cycles), which occurred in 23% of the menstruating subject s. 
Decreased appetite occurred in 4% of all subject s. Body odor (probably caused by [CONTACT_525019], phenylacetate  [PAA] ) and bad taste or tas te aversion were each reported in 3% of 
subject s.

Other adverse events reported in 2% or fewer subject s were:  
• Gastrointestinal: abdominal pain, gastritis, nausea and vomiting; constipation, rectal 
bleeding, peptic ulcer disease, and pancreatitis each oc curred in one subject .  
• Hematologic: aplastic anemia and ecchymoses each occurred in one subject .  
• Cardiovascular: arrhythmia and edema each occurred in one subject .  
• Renal: renal tubular acidosis  
• Psychiatric: depression  
• Skin: rash  
• Miscellaneous: headac he, syncope, and weight gain  
 
Phenylbutyrate has been evaluated in a dose -escalating study in ALS subject s over the course of 
20-weeks and was found to be generally safe and tolerable15. Specifically, t he most common 
adverse events included falls  or other  accidental injury , dizziness, diarrhea, edema, dry mouth, 
headache,  nausea, and rash . With the exception of  headache, these adverse events occurred at a 
higher  rate compared to  the comparison placebo cohort. These events  are expected side effects 
from PB. There were no clinically significant changes in  laboratory values, EKGs or vital signs. 
No deaths or  unexpected and related serious adverse events occurred.  Significant adverse events 
did not occur more  frequently with subjects who were taking riluzole in  addition to NPB, 
compared to subjects taking PB  alone.  Importantly, this study evaluated daily dosages of 
phenylbutyrate between [ADDRESS_681291] s receiving intr avenous phenylacetate, 250 –300 
mg/kg/day for 14 days, repeated at 4 -week intervals. Manifestations were predominately 
somnolence, fatigue, and lightheadedness; with less frequent headache, dysgeusia, hypoacusis, 
disorientation, impaired memory, and exacerb ation of a pre -existing neuropathy.  
 
These adverse events were mainly mild in severity. The acute onset and reversibility when the 
phenylacetate infusion was discontinued suggest a drug effect . 
 
The m ost common adverse reactions reported with the use of T UDCA (≥1%) are: abdominal 
discomfort, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, pruritus, and rash.  
 
TUDCA is generally well tolerated. A derivative, UDCA or ursodiol, is approved for subject s 
with primary biliary cirrhosis. Common adverse events  with TUDCA  includ e mild abdominal 
pain and diarrhea. There are some cases of pruritus and a very limited number of cases of 
elevated liver enzymes.   
 
TUDCA has been evaluated over a year -long placebo controlled study in ALS subject s at 1g 
b.i.d17. The population for safety  analysis consist ed of [ADDRESS_681292] s. Laboratory 
parameters did not change in  either treatment group during the course of the study.  Except for

 the expected com plications related to ALS,  no changes in vital signs and laboratory values that  
could possibly be attributed to the study drug or placebo  were recorded. Overall, five adverse 
events were  considered by [CONTACT_525020]’ 
descriptions. Two events were  reported in the [ADDRESS_681293] s (13.3%);  three events 
occurred in the [ADDRESS_681294] s (21.4%). The events were as follows: m ild diarrhea 
occurred in two  subject s treated with TUDCA and in two treate d with  placebo; anorexia was 
reported in a placebo -treated  subject . Four subject s died during the study period,  one in the 
TUDCA group and three in the placebo  group.  The one death in the treated group was not 
considered drug related —TUDCA trended towards a survival benefit.   
 
The risks and side effects of muscle strength testing include fatigue and/or muscle crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  
 
2.2.[ADDRESS_681295] both been tested individually in ALS clinical trials and met their 
primary  endpoints of safety  and tolerability . TUDCA also met its efficacy endpoint of slowing 
ALSFRS -R decline , and PB was therapeutically efficient in improving histone acety lation levels. 
If successful, this trial will allow further clinical development of this therapy to potentially slow 
ALS progression. The trial is also assessing multiple biomarkers in concert with clinical 
endpoints , which will allow  both a more detailed understanding of drug activity as well as serve 
as a data set for the field as a whole to help understand how these biomarkers might track ALS 
progression.

Protocol Number: AMX3500  
Version 6.[ADDRESS_681296] s with ALS. The main strategic objectives of this protocol  are below.   
 
The primary outcome measures will be:  
1. To confirm the safety and tolerability of a fixed -dose combination of PB and  TUDCA in 
subject s with ALS over a 6 -month period ; 
2. To measure the impact of the treatment using the slope of progression with the revised 
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS -R); 
 
The secondary objectives of the study will be:  
1. To assess the impact  of AMX0035 on the rate of decline of isometric muscle  strength, as 
measured by [CONTACT_525008] (ATLIS) ; 
2. To assess the impact of AMX0035 on disease progression as measured by [CONTACT_525021] (SVC) decline, time to tracheost omy and survival ; 
3. To assess the impact of AMX0035 on biomarkers including phosphorylated  axonal 
neurofilament H subunit (pNF -H) levels and 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO) uptake ;  
4. To develop concentration -response models of TUDCA and phenylbutyrate at s teady -state 
after administration of AMX0035 sachet twice -daily.  
5. To measure the impact of AMX0035 on survival . 
 
3.2 Study Outcome Measures  
3.2.1  Primary Outcome Measures  
The primary  outcome  measure s for the study  will include : 
• Safety  and tolerability  as def ined as the proportion of subject s able to remain on study 
drug until planned discontinuation.  
• The rate  of decline (slope of decline)  in the ALS  functional  rating  scale  (ALSFRS -R).   
 
Safety and tolerability will be assessed by  [CONTACT_525022] 9. 
 
The revised version of the ALSFRS was created to add assessments of respi[INVESTIGATOR_26517], 
including dyspnea, orthopnea, and the need for ventilatory support. The revised ALSFRS 
(ALSFRS -R) has been  demonstrated to retain the properties of the original scale and show strong 
internal consistency and construct validity.  
 
Survival endpoint will be defined as d eath, tracheostomy or permanent assisted  ventilation (> 22 
hours a day).

Version 6.[ADDRESS_681304] s who are using  Mexiletine at a dosage less than or equal to 
300mg/day for cramps and fasciculations  will not be excluded .  
 
There is a potential for an interaction between AMX0035 and Mexiletine ; at 20 times the 
intended clinical concentration (C max), the principal metabolite of Phenylbutyrate, 
Phenylacetylacetate has been s hown to be inhibitory to CYP 1A2 and CYP 2D6 which are the 
major enzymes responsible for the breakdown of Mexiletine. Therefore, it is possible the co-
administration of Phenylbutyrate and Mexiletine will increase the subject ’s exposure to 
Mexiletine.  
 
Subjects who are co -administered AMX0035 and Mexiletine should therefore be mo nitored for 
Mexiletine -associated adverse events, and if these events present , the Site I nvestigator should 
consider stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_524990] . Adverse events ass ociated with 
Mexiletine include but are not limited to cardiac arrhythmias, liver injury, and blood dyscrasias.  
5.[ADDRESS_681305] who meets all eligibility criteria will be randomized to receive either therapy by 
[CONTACT_525026]0035 (3g PB and 1g TUDCA)  or matching placebo for [ADDRESS_681306] will be discontinued from participation in the study if:  
• Any clinical adverse event (AE ), laboratory abnormality, requirement for a concomitant 
medication, concurrent illness, or other medical condition or situation occurs such that , in 
the opi[INVESTIGATOR_14270] , continued participation in the study would not be in the 
best interest of the subject.  
• The subject is non -compliant or is lost-to-follow -up. 
 
 
AMX -0035 in ALS  
Protocol Number: AMX3500  
Version 6.[ADDRESS_681307] may choose to discontinue participation in the study at any time.  However, the Site 
Investigator (SI) or designee will encourage subjects to cont inue with follow -up, regardless of 
their compliance with the  study drug.  If the SI or designee is concerned about the use of a 
prohibited medication or other safety issues, then the study drug may have t o be reduced to 
single dose or discontinued.  If a subject permanently discontinues study drug , the SI or design ee 
should still encourage su bjects to follow the study protocol under the modified  intent -to-treat 
principle (ITT). These subjects will be encouraged to follow th e study visits, off drug. Loss to 
follow -up should be prevented whenever possible.  
 
Any subjec t who is on study drug and needs to begin the use of any prohibited medication, must 
immediately discontinue use of the study drug and should not begin use of the prohibited 
medication before an appropriate wash -out period  of at least [ADDRESS_681308] a Follow -Up Telephone Call 
no sooner than 28 days  (+5 days) after taking their last dose of study drug  to monitor their safety 
and to permit review of their medical records at the e nd of the study to document their vital 
status .  
 
Subjects who withdraw from the study due to adverse events will be followed for outcome 
measures under the ITT protocol as noted above. The DSMB will review these events promptly 
and make recommendations ab out potential changes to the study , including possible changes to 
protocol, updates to the informed consent form, or even ending the study early.   
 
In the event a subject wishes to no longer have their personal health information used for the 
analysis of this study, he or she will notify the site through an authorized letter and future data 
will not be included in analysis ; however, all data up to this letter will still be included.

 7 STUDY SCHEDULE  
No study procedures should be performed prior to the signing of the informed consent form 
(ICF). All subjects will sign an ICF prior to undergoing any study tests or procedures. It is 
recommended that  the ALSFRS -R be completed first at every visit. After  the ALSFRS -R it is 
recommended that SVC and ATLIS meas urements are performed so as not to fatigue the subject 
with other testing .  Blood samples  are recommended to be  taken at the end of the study visits. 
The order of testing , however,  will be at the discretion of each Site Investigator (SI).  
 
Visit windows a re consecutive calendar days and the target visit dates are calculated from the 
Baseline Visit.   
 
Subjects who withdraw consent or early terminate from the study (i.e., discontinue study drug) 
will be asked to come in for a Final Safety Visit and have a F inal Follow -up Telephone Call 28 
days (+5 days) after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_524993]. 
7.1 MR-PET Scheduling Call

Sub-Study procedures will be conducted at [LOCATION_005] Gen eral Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (MGH) in [LOCATION_011], 
MA. However, blood will be drawn for TSPO testing at the subject’s site during the Screening 
Visit.  
 
Subjects participating in the MR-PET Sub-Study may be  consented over the phon e by a 
medically licensed professional  MGH study staff member  to determine subject eligibility and to 
ensure the subject is safe to undergo  the MR-PET scan .  These procedures include:  
o Obtain verbal  pre-screening informed consent from subject  
o Assess MR-PET inclusion and exclusion criteria  
o Complete MR-PET safety questionnaire  
 
During this call, MR-PET Sub-Study procedures will be discussed in detail and the subject 
should be given the opportunity to ask questions  about the MR-PET Sub-Study.  The MGH study

8.1.2  Clinical Laboratory Assessments  
The following laboratory tests will  be performed for safety:  
 
o Hematology with differential panel: complete blood count with differential (hematocrit, 
hemoglobin, platelet count, RBC indices, Total RBC, Total WBC, and WBC & 
differential)  
 
o Blood chemistry panel/Liver function tests (LFTs):  alanine aminotransferase  (ALT

Additionally, blood will be collected for biomarker analysis, including light and heavy 
neurof ilament testing  (NF-L and pNF -H, respectively) . Neurofilaments will be used as a 
mechanistic measure of neuronal death. These proteins are greatly elevated in ALS subject s and 
promising results from multiple trials suggest this marker may be prognostic of clinical decline. 
NF-L and pNF -H will be tested over multiple time points with the intention of generating a 
longitudinal dataset correlating neurofilament levels to observed clinical outcomes. This dataset 
will help to validate AMX0035 therapeutic mechani sm and provide a dataset for the ALS field.

 8.1.9 Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale  (C-SSRS)  
The US FDA recommends the use of a suicidality assessment instrument that maps to the 
Columbia Classification Algorithm for Suicide Assessment (C -CASA)22. The C -CASA was 
developed to assist the FDA in coding suicidal ity data accumulated during the conduct of clinical 
trials of antidepressant drugs. One such assessment instrument is the Columbia Suicide Severity 
Rating Scale (C -SSRS)23. The C -SSRS involves a series of probin g questions to inquire about 
possible suicidal thinking and behavior.  
 
At the Baseline Visit, the C -SSRS Baseline version will be administered.  This version is used to 
assess suicidality over the subject’s lifetime .  
 
At all clinic visits after the Baseli ne Visit , the Since Last Visit version of the C -SSRS will be 
administered. This version of the scale assesses suicidality since the  subject’s last visit.  
8.1.10  Exit Questionnaire  
An exit questionnaire will be completed by [CONTACT_525034] (Week 24). This will include questions regarding blindedness and overall experience with  
the trial.  
 
8.1.11  Adverse Events  
Adverse events (AEs) will be documented at each study visit, including the Screening Visit once 
the inform ed consent form has been signed by [CONTACT_423], and at all study visits, including the 
Final Telephone Call 28 days (+ 5 days) after the last dose of study drug.   Information on 
adverse effects of study drug and on inter -current events will be determined a t each visit by 
[CONTACT_525035], review of concomitant medications, and vital sign results.

 8.2.2 Pulmonary Function Testing  - Slow Vital Capacity  (SVC)  
Slow Vital Capacity (SVC) : The vital capacity (VC) (percent of predicted normal) will be 
determined, using the upright slow VC method. The VC can be measured using conventional 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_318353] a calibration check prior to subject testing.  A printout from the 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_318354]. All VC evaluators must be NEALS certified. Three 
VC trials are required for each testing session, however up to [ADDRESS_681344] VC is 10% or greater for the  first [ADDRESS_681345] VC recorded is utilized for eligibility.  
8.2.3  Isometric Strength Testing  (ATLIS)  
Accurate Testing of Limb Isometric  Strength : We are measuring isometric strength using the 
Accur ate Testing of Limb Isometric Strength device (ATLIS) developed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Patricia Andres 
of [LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. The device was specifically designed to alleviate the 
reproducibility concerns that exist for prior strength measurements such a s hand  held 
dynamometry (HHD) . ATLIS does not depend on experimenter strength, and has measurement 
settings to ensure that subject s are in the same position each time they are tested.  All ATLIS 
evaluators must be trained and certified. ATLIS may detect function al decline before the 
ALSFRS -R, which may have a ceiling effect, and may be able to detect changes in function with 
greater sensitivity to ALSFRS -R. The measure does show a small training effect, so we will 
include measurement at initial screening visit to  allow subject s to become acquainted with the 
device.

the Site Manual  of Procedures (MOP) .  
8.2.[ADDRESS_681347] be NEALS certified to perform the ALSFRS -R, SVC and ATLIS; specific 
certification requirements are outlined in the study operations manual. Repeat NEALS 
certification will be required every two years for all NEALS certified outcome measures . It is 
strongly preferred that a single evaluator performs all measures throughout the study, if possible. 
NEALS certification is required for all evaluators prior to performing any study tests.

 9 SAFETY AND ADVERSE EV ENTS  
The adverse event (AE) definitions and reporting procedures provided in this protocol comply 
with all applicable [LOCATION_002] Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations and 
International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guide lines.  The Site Investigator will 
carefully monitor each subject throughout the study for possible adverse events.  All AEs will be 
documented on CRFs designed specifically for this purpose.  It is also important to report all 
AEs, especially those that r esult in permanent discontinuation of the investigational product 
being studied, whether serious or non -serious.  
9.1 Definitions of AEs, Suspected Adverse Drug Reactions & SAEs  
9.1.1  Adverse Event and Suspected Adverse Drug Reactions  
An adverse event (AE) is any unfavorable and unintended sign (including a clinically significant 
abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with a 
study, use of a drug product or device whether or not considered related to the drug prod uct or 
device.  
 
Adverse drug reactions (ADR) are all noxious and unintended responses to a medicinal product 
related to any dose.  The phrase “responses to a medicinal product” means that a causal 
relationship between a medicinal product and an adverse ev ent is at least a reasonable possibility, 
i.e., the relationship cannot be ruled out.  Therefore, a subset of AEs can be classified as 
suspected ADRs, if there is a causal relationship to the medicinal product.  
 
Examples of adverse events include: new cond itions, worsening of pre -existing conditions, 
clinically significant abnormal physical examination signs (i.e. skin rash, peripheral edema, etc), 
or clinically significant abnormal test results (i.e. lab values or vital signs), with the exception of 
outcom e measure results, which are not being recorded as adverse events in this trial (they are 
being collected, but analyzed separately). Stable chronic conditions (i.e., diabetes, arthritis) that 
are present prior to the start of the study and do not worsen du ring the trial are NOT considered 
adverse events.  Chronic conditions that occur more frequently (for intermittent conditions) or 
with greater severity, would be considered as worsened and therefore would be recorded as 
adverse events.  
 
Adverse events are generally detected in two ways:  
  
Clinical → symptoms reported by [CONTACT_243075].  
 
Ancillary Tests → abnormalities of vital signs, laboratory tests, and other diagnostic 
procedures (other than the outcome measures, the results  of which are not being captured 
as AEs).

 For the purposes of this study, symptoms of progression/worsening of ALS, including ‘normal’ 
progression, will be recorded as adverse events.     
 
The following measures of disease progression will not be recorded  as adverse events even if 
they worsen (they are being recorded and analyzed separately): vital capacity results , ALSFRS -
R, and ATLIS results.  
 
If discernible at the time of completing the AE log, a specific disease or syndrome rather than 
individual assoc iated signs and symptoms should be identified by [CONTACT_525036].  However, if an observed or reported sign, symptom, or clinically 
significant laboratory anomaly is not considered by [CONTACT_246413] a component  of a 
specific disease or syndrome, then it should be recorded as a separate AE on the AE log.  
Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities, such as those that require intervention, are those 
that are identified as such by [CONTACT_67505].  
 
Subje cts will be monitored for adverse events from the time they sign consent until completion 
of their participation in the study (defined as death, consent withdrawal, loss to follow up, early 
study termination for other reasons or following completion of the  entire study).   
 
An unexpected adverse event is any adverse event, the specificity or severity of which is not 
consistent with the current Investigator ’s Brochure.  An unexpected, suspected adverse drug 
reaction is any unexpected adverse event for which , in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_524996]  (or their designee) , there is a reasonable possibility that the investigational product 
caused the event.  
9.1.2  Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as an adverse event that mee ts any of the following 
criteria:  
1. Results in death.  
2. Is life threatening: that is, poses an immediate risk of death as the event occurred.  
a. This serious criterion applies if the study subject, in the view of the Site 
Investigator or Sponsor, is at immediate risk of death from the AE as it occurs .  It 
does not apply if an AE hypothetically might have caused death if it were more 
severe.  
3. Requires in -patient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081].  
a. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34096] (i ncluding elective PEG tube/g -
tube/feeding tube placement) or a routinely scheduled treatment is not an SAE by 
[CONTACT_246414] “procedure” or a “treatment” is not 
an untoward medical occurrence.  
4. Results in persistent or signi ficant disability or incapacity.  
 
 
AMX -0035 in ALS  
Protocol Number: AMX3500  
Version 6.0 
Version date 11Jan 2019 
Page 68 of 101 
 a. This serious criterion applies if the “disability” caused by [CONTACT_318378] a substantial disruption of the subject’s ability to carry out normal life 
functions.  
5. Results in congenital anomaly or birth defect in the offspring of the subject (whether the 
subject is male or female).   
6. Necessitates medical or surgical intervention to preclude permanent impairment of a 
body function or permanent damage to a body structure.  
7. Important medical events that may not result in death, are not life -threatening, or do not 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_243047], based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes  listed in this definition.  Examples of such 
medical events include blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in in -patient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
 
An in -patient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_243048] a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_2505], treatment -emergent, clinical 
adverse event may meet criteria for "seriousness" but is not an adverse experience, and will 
therefore, not be considered an SAE.  An example of this would include a social admission 
(subject admitted for other  reasons than medical, e.g., lives far from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], has no place to 
sleep).  
 
A serious, suspected adverse drug reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) is an SAE for which , in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_524997], there is a reasonable possibility that the invest igational product 
caused the event.  
 
The Site Investigator is responsible for classifying adverse events as serious or non -serious.  
9.[ADDRESS_681348] throughout the stud y for possible AEs.  
All AEs will be documented on source document templates  and e CRFs designed specifically for 
this purpose.  All AEs will be collected and reported in the electronic data capture (EDC) system 
and compi[INVESTIGATOR_524998]. The Medical Monitor 
shall promptly review all information relevant to the safety of the investigational product, 
including all serious adverse events (SAEs).  Special attention will be paid to those that result in 
permanent disc ontinuation of the investigational product being studied, whether serious or non -
serious.  
 
9.2.1  Assessment of Adverse Events  
At each visit (including telephone interviews), the subject will be asked if they have had  any 
problems or symptoms since their last visit in order to determine the occurrence of adverse 
events.   If the subject reports an adverse event, the Investigator will probe further to determine:  
1. Type of event  
2. Date of onset and resolution (duration)  
 
 
AMX -0035 in ALS

 3. Severity (mild, moderate, severe)  
4. Seriousnes s (does the event meet the above definition for an SAE)  
5. Causality, relation to investigational product and disease  
6. Action taken regarding investigational product  
7. Outcome  
9.2.[ADDRESS_681349] should be specified by [CONTACT_42737], using the following definitions:  
 
1.  Not Related:          Concomitant illness, accident or event with no reasonable 
association with treatment.  
 
2.  Unlikely:  The reaction h as little or no temporal sequence from administration 
of the investigational product, and/or a more likely alternative 
etiology exists.  
 
3.  Possibly Related:  The reaction follows a reasonably temporal sequence from 
administration of the investigational pr oduct and follows a known 
response pattern to the suspected investigational product; the 
reaction could have been produced by [CONTACT_246415]’s clinical state or by 
[CONTACT_243079]. (Suspected 
ADR)  
 
4.  Probably Related:  The reaction follows a reasonably temporal sequence from 
administration of investigational product; is confirmed by 
[CONTACT_246416] -challenge; 
and cannot be reas onably explained by [CONTACT_287525]’s clinical state. (Suspected ADR)  
 
5.  Definitely Related:  The reaction follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of investigational product; that follows a known or 
expected res ponse pattern to the investigational product; and that is 
confirmed by [CONTACT_3895][INVESTIGATOR_318360], and reappearance of the reaction on 
repeated exposure. (Suspected ADR)

9.2.4  Recording of Adverse Events  
All clinical adve rse events are recorded in the Adverse Event (AE) Log in the subject’s study 
binder. The site should fill out the AE Log and enter the AE information into the Electronic Data 
Capture (EDC) system within 48 hours of the site learning of a new AE or receivin g an update 
on an existing AE.   
 
Please Note:  Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) must be reported to the Medical Monitor and 
Coordination Center within 24 hours of the site learning of the SAE.  
 
Entries on the AE Log (and into the EDC) will include the follow ing: name [CONTACT_318381], the date of onset, the date of resolution, relationship to investigational product, action 
taken, and primary outcome of event.

Version 6.[ADDRESS_681351] (DSMB) will be assembled for the trial. The 
DSMB receives the blinded a nd unblinded summary reports of the frequency of all clinical 
adverse events and safety laboratory tests for planned periodic meetings as specified in the 
DSMB charter . In addition, the DSMB Chair may call ad hoc meetings.  Meetings will be held 
via telecon ference.  A DSMB Charter will detail the processes of this group.   
 
Summaries of serious adverse events and enrollment will be provided approximately monthly  to 
the DSMB by [CONTACT_525037]. Any possibly, probably or definitely study drug related ,  
serious adverse events (i.e. serious adverse drug reactions, or S[LOCATION_003]Rs) are considered events of 
interest and will be reported in real -time (within 1 business day of Coordination Center (CC) 
awareness) to the DSMB. All adverse events and abnormal labora tory values results will be 
listed and will be completely identified (using MedDRA adverse reaction codes) by [CONTACT_525038].  The DSMB can ask to receive the SAE reports more frequently.  As necessary, the 
DSMB can review the frequencies of clinical an d laboratory abnormalities.  Recommendations 
for modification or termination of the trial based on safety data will be made by [CONTACT_525039].  The DSMB will review safety data throughout the trial and may 
stop the trial for saf ety if they determine that there is a significant difference in the rate of a 
particular adverse event that would indicate a risk that is greater than the possible benefit of the 
study drug.  A notable increase in the frequency of any adverse event should be examined by [CONTACT_525040] a recommendation by [CONTACT_4318].  
 
Prior to each DSMB meeting, the CC will provide an update to the DSMB on enrollment, data 
quality (missing data) and protocol adherence.  The CC will be responsible for com munication 
with the DSMB.

 Power for safety and tolerability was considered in three ways: incidence of adverse events 
(AEs), change in ALFSR -R and ATLIS, and change in biomarker such as pNF -H. 
 
With [ADDRESS_681354] an 80% probability of detecting any adverse event 
expected to occur in at least 2% of treated subject s. We will have 80% power to detect a [ADDRESS_681355] at alpha = 0.05. We will consider a dose tolerable if the proportion of treatment 
failures (discontinuation of study drug due to an adverse event) is less than 40% with 80% 
confidence, one -tailed. With [ADDRESS_681356] 80% power for 
declaring AMX0035 tolerable at the tested dose if the true treatment failure rate is 30%.  
 
A shared -baseline, mixed -effects analysis will be used for primary analysis . A covariate of 
bulbar onset or onset elsewhere  and a second covariate of age at enrollment  will be included in 
the analysis. The mixed -effects model accounts for both the variance between subject s and the 
deviation within subjects from their average rate of decline. We will use the same analysis for 
clinical outcomes in this trial. We propose to test at an alpha of 0. 05. 
 
Further detail on primary analysis and analysis rationale for secondary endpoints will be 
included in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).

occurrence of ea ch adverse event and incidence of Grade III/IV adverse events. Total number of 
serious adverse events and abnormal laboratory tests will be compared between groups using 
Fisher's exact test. Withdrawal, abnormal laboratory tests, vital signs and use of con comitant 
medications will be assessed to characterize the safety profile of the combination of PB and 
TUDCA. Compliance data will be determined for each visit and by [CONTACT_1570]. The time to 
subject  refusal will be compared between treatment groups to better determine tolerability. This 
will be accomplished using a method of survival analysis that allows informative censoring due 
to death. Descriptive statistics denoting the changes from baseline to the final assessment visit 
with respect to key laborat ory parameters and vital signs will also be provided.  
 
Further detail will be provided in a statistical analysis plan.

assessment after randomization. Slope will be imputed from available data and time points. 
Homogeneity of clinical characteristics and efficacy variables at baseline between th e two 
randomization groups (between -group baseline differences) will be assessed by [CONTACT_525041] a chi -squared test for discrete variables. All efficacy 
endpoints will compared between the two randomization groups at  study end (between -group 
differences at study end) by [CONTACT_525042], adjusting 
for baseline value and for center effect, and by a chi -squared test for discrete variables. Survival 
time will compared between treat ments by a Kaplan –Meier survival analysis.  
 
The primary analysis strategy will use a shared -baseline, mixed -effects model of ALSFRS -R 
progression rate. The mixed -effects model accounts for both the variance between subject s and 
the deviation within subjec ts from their average rate of decline. We will use the same analysis 
for clinical outcomes in this trial. We propose to test at an alpha of 0. 05. We are targeting an 
effect size (slowing of ALSFRS -R slope) greater than 30% based on the trial by [CONTACT_525043]17. In 
the Phase I/II trial of TUDCA that analyzed a total of 29 subjects, the ALSFRS -R score declined 
32.5% more slowly in the TUDCA group: the slopes of the two regression lines were 
significantly different ( -0.262/week for the TUDCA group, -0.388/week fo r the placebo group; P 
< 0.01).  
10.2.4  Analysis Populations  
The modified  intent to treat (ITT) population will include all study subjects who are randomized 
and receive at least one dose of study drug. The ITT population will be considered for primary 
analyses. For ITT analyses, subjects will be grouped based on randomized treatment, regardless 
of treatment actually received.  
 
10.3 Missing Data  
The trial will be modified  intent to treat (ITT).  Every effort will be made to obtain follow -up 
information for a ll subjects whether or not they continue on treatment.

 11 DATA COLLECTION, MANAGEMENT AND MONIT ORING  
11.1 Role of Data Management  
Data Management (DM) is the development, execution and supervision of plans, policies, 
programs, and practices that control, protect, deliver, and enhance the value of data and 
information assets.  
 
All data will be managed in compliance with applicable Sponsor (or their designee) policies and 
regulatory requirements. Site personnel will collect, transcribe, correct, and transmit  the data 
onto source documents, Case Report Forms  (CRFs ), and other forms used to report, track and 
record clinical research data.  Clinical sites will be monitored to ensure compliance with data 
management requiremen ts and Good Clinical Practices.  DM is  responsible for developi[INVESTIGATOR_007], 
testing, and managing clinical data management activities.  
11.1.1  Data Entry and Checks  
The site personnel are instructed to enter information into the Electronic Data Capture (EDC) 
System within 5 days of a visit.  Please Note : Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) must be reported 
to the Coordination Center within 24 hours of the site learning of the SAE.  Data collection is the 
responsibility of the staff at the site under  the supervision of the Site Investigator (SI) .  During 
the st udy, the  Site Investigator must maintain complete and accurate documentation for the 
study.  
 
The EDC  includes password protection .  An edit checking and data clarification process will be 
put in place to ensure accuracy and completeness of the database.  L ogic and range checks as 
well as more sophisticated rules will be built into the EDC to provide immediate error checking 
of the data entered.  The system has the capability to  automatically create electronic queries for 
forms that  contain data that are out  of range, out of window, missin g or not calculated correctly.  
The sites will only have access to the queries concerning their subjects.   
11.1.[ADDRESS_681359] Read -Only access to 
the data. The database can only be locked after each Site Investigator (SI) has signed off on their 
subjects and all queries have been resolved.   
11.1.3  Quality Assurance  
Protocol procedures are reviewed with the Site Investigator  (SI) and associated personnel prior to 
the study to ensure the accuracy and reliability of data. Each SI must adhere to the protocol 
detailed in this document and agree that any  changes to the protocol must be approved by [CONTACT_525044].  Each Site Investigator will 
be responsible for enrolling only those study subjects who have met protocol eligibility criteria.

 13 APPENDICES  
13.1 APPENDIX I: EL ESCORIAL WORLD FEDER ATION OF NEUROLOGY 
CRITERIA FOR THE DIA GNOSIS OF ALS  
 
Information obtained from the web site: www.wfnals.org . 
 
The diagnosis of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis [ALS] requires:  
 
A - The presence of:  
 (A:1) evidence of lower m otor neuron (LMN) degeneration by [CONTACT_2085], electrop hysiology
 or neuropathologic examination,  
 (A:2) evidence of upper motor neuron (UMN) degeneration by [CONTACT_12148], and  
 (A:3) progressive spread of symptoms or signs within a region or t o other  regions, as 
determined by [CONTACT_525049], together with  
 
B - The absence of:  
 (B:1) electrophysiological and pathological evidence of other disease processes that 
might explain the signs of LMN and/or UMN degeneration, and  
 (B:2) neuroimaging evi dence of other disease processes that might explain the observed 
 clinical and electrophysiological signs.  
 
CLINICAL STUDIES IN THE DIAGNOSIS OF ALS  
 
A careful history, physical and neurological examination must search for clinical evidence of 
UMN and LMN  signs in four regions [brainstem, cervical, thoracic, or lumbosacral spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831]] 
(see Table 1) of the central nervous system [CNS]. Ancillary tests should be reasonably applied, 
as clinically indicated, to exclude other disease processes. These should in clude 
electrodiagnostic, neurophysiological, neuroimaging and clinical laboratory studies.  Clinical 
evidence of LMN and UMN degeneration is required for the diagnosis of ALS.  The clinical 
diagnosis of ALS, without pathological confirmation, may be catego rized into various levels of 
certainty by [CONTACT_525050] [bulbar cranial motor 
neurons], cervical, thoracic, or lumbosacral  spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831] [anterior horn motor neurons]. The terms 
Clinical Definite ALS and Clinically Probable ALS are used to describe these categories of 
clinical diagnostic certainty on clinical criteria alone:  
 
A. Clinically Definite ALS is defined on clinical ev idence alone by [CONTACT_525051], as 
well as LMN signs, in three regions.  
 
B. Clinically Probable ALS is defined on clinical evidence alone by [CONTACT_525052] (above) the LMN signs.  
 
 
AMX -0035 in ALS  
Protocol Number: AMX3500  
Version 6.[ADDRESS_681364] two limbs, with proper 
application of neuroimaging and clinical laboratory protocols to exclude other causes.  
 
D. Clinically Possible ALS is defined when clinical signs of UMN and LMN dysfunction are 
found together in only one region or UMN signs are found alone in t wo or more regions; or 
LMN signs are found rostral to UMN signs and the diagnosis of Clinically Probable - 
Laboratory -supported ALS cannot be proven by [CONTACT_525053], neurophysiologic, neuroimaging or cl inical laboratory studies. Other diagnoses 
must have been excluded to accept a diagnosis of Clinically Possible ALS.

SUICIDAL BEHAVIOR  
(Check all that apply, so long as these are separate events; must ask about all types)  Lifetime  
Actual Attempt:  
A potentially self -injurious act committed with at least some wish to die, as a result o f act. Behavior was in 
part thought of as method to kill oneself. Intent does not have to be 100%. If there is any intent/desire to die 
associated with the act, then it can be considered an actual suicide attempt. There does not have to be 
any injury or ha rm, just the potential for injury or harm. If person pulls trigger while gun is in mouth but 
gun is broken so no injury results, this is considered an attempt.  
Inferring Intent: Even if an individual denies intent/wish to die, it may be inferred clinicall y from the behavior or 
circumstances. For example, a highly lethal act that is clearly not an accident so no other intent but suicide 
can be inferred (e.g., gunshot to head, jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_24608] a high floor/story). Also, if someone denies 
intent to die,  but they thought that what they did could be lethal, intent may be inferred.  
Have you made a suicide attempt?  
Have you done anything to harm yourself?  
Have you done anything dangerous where you could have died?  
What did you do?  
Did you______ as a way  to end your life?  
Did you want to die (even a little) when you_____?  
Were you trying to end your life when you _____?  
Or did you think it was possible you could have died from_____?  
Or did you do it purely for other reasons / without ANY intention of killing yourself (like 
to relieve stress, feel better, get sympathy, or get something else to happen)? (Self-
Injurious Behavior without suicidal intent)

 Interrupted Attempt:  
When the person is interrupted (by [CONTACT_24662]) from starting the potentially self -injurious act (if 
not for that, actual attempt would have occurred).  
Overdose: Person h as pi[INVESTIGATOR_24609]. Once they ingest any pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], this becomes an 
attempt rather than an interrupted attempt. Shooting: Person has gun pointed toward self, gun is taken away 
by [CONTACT_24663], or is somehow prevented from pulling tr igger. Once they pull the trigger, even if the gun 
fails to fire, it is an attempt. Jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_007]: Person is poised to jump, is grabbed and taken down from ledge. 
Hanging: Person has noose around neck but has not yet started to hang - is stopped from doing so.

A potentially self -injurious act committed with at least some wish to die, as a result of act. Behavior was in part 
thought of as method to kill oneself. Intent does not have to be 100%. If there is any intent/desire to die associated 
with the act, then it can be considered an actual suicide attempt. There does not have to be any i njury or 
harm , just the potential for injury or harm. If person pulls trigger while gun is in mouth but gun is broken so no 
injury results, this is considered an attempt.  
Inferring Intent: Even if an individual denies intent/wish to die, it may be inferre d clinically from the behavior or 
circumstances. For example, a highly lethal act that is clearly not an accident so no other intent but suicide can be 
inferred (e.g., gunshot to head, jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_24608] a high floor/story). Also, if someone denies int ent to die, but 
they thought that what they did could be lethal, intent may be inferred.

The following instructions will be provided orally to the patient at the Baseline  Visit by a 
healthcare staff member. Please have the Listerine® products  (Pocketpaks® and Pocketmist®) 
available for demonstration.  
 
- Alert the patient that the study drug has a strong bitter taste , but that there are ways to make it 
more palatable (see b elow).  
 
- Rip open the sachet of study drug and add it to a cup or other container and add approximately 
8 oz. (1 cup) of room temperature water and stir vigorously. Study drug may require significant 
stirring or gentle crushing to dissolve.  
 
- The treatm ent should be taken within one hour of mixing into water.  
 
- Several things may be done to reduce the bad taste and make the drug more palatable:  
 
1) Use Listerine Pocket Packs®  (strips)  or a Listerine PocketMist®  (spray)  immediately 
before and/or immediat ely after taking the drug. Use liberally to coat the mouth. This has 
been found  to significantly  mask the bitter  taste.  
 
2) Take a snack or a meal after taking your treatment.  
 
3) Follow drug immediately with milk to remove taste from the mouth.  
 
4) Avoid drinking fruit juice at the same time as the drug as this may make flavor worse.  
 
- Mixing the study drug with a liquid other than water  should be avoided .

 OPEN LABEL EXTENSION PLAN  
 
Study Indication  
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)  
 
Phase of Development  
II 
Rationale for the Study  
The objective of this study is to determine the long -term safety of AMX0035 in subjects with Amyotrophic 
Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). ALS is a progressive neurodegenerative disease for which there is no cure. There are 
only two medicines approved specifically for treating ALS, Rilutek (riluzole) and Radicava (edaravone). ALS 
also exacts a significant economic burde n. 
 
AMX0035 has demonstrated efficacy in models of neurodegeneration, classical activation of 
neuroinflammation, and bioenergetics deficits. The individual components of AMX0035, PB and TUDCA 
have demonstrated efficacy in in vivo models of ALS, Parkinson’s , Alzheimer’s, ischemia, and many others. 
Each individual component has also been tested in small clinical trials of ALS subjects and was found to be 
safe and well -tolerated, and hit primary endpoints of efficacy.  
 
Study Design and Plan  
This is a multicent er, open label extension, up to 132-week study evaluating the long -term safety of 
AMX0035. Up to one hundred thirty -two (132) subjects will be given oral (or feeding tube) twice daily sachet 
of active therapy.  Treatment duration will be  up to one thirty -two (132) weeks starting at the 
Screening/Baseline visit.  Clinic visits will occur at Screening/Baseline, Week 6 (day 42), Week 12 (day 84), 
Week 24 (day 168), Week 36 (day 252), and Week 52 (Day 3 64), Week 6 8 (Day 476), Week 8 4 (Day 588), 
Week 10 0 (Day 700), Week 116 (Day 812), Week 132 (Day 924) . 
 
All visit windows are consecutive calendar days and are calculated from the day the subject starts study 
treatment (Day 0, the day of the Screening/Baseline Visit). The  screening/Baseline visit must  occur withi n 28 
days of the Week 24 visit of the main study.  If the Screening/Baseline visit occurs on the day of the Week 24 
visit or within 7 days of that visit then it is not necessary to complete the assessments, labs and outcomes.  If 
the Screening/Baseline vis it occurs Day 8 – Day 28 then all assessments, la bs and outcomes need to be 
comple ted.  Visit windows will be +/ - 10 days for the Week 6 and Week 12 visits and +/ - 28 days for the Week 
24, Week 36, Week  52, Week 6 8, Week 8 4, Week 10 0, Week 116 and Week 132  visits. Any change from this 
visit window will be considered an out of window visit deviation.  
 
Study Objectives  
The primary objective of the study is to assess long -term safety of oral (or feeding tube) administration of 
AMX0035 via sachet (3g PB and 1g TUDCA) twice daily for compassionate use.  
The primary outcome measure is:

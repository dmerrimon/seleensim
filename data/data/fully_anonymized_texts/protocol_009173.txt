2. Objectives
There  has traditionally been very low uptake of diabetes education programs among immigrant men.  This may be in part due to a lack of engagement of these community’s social support networks.  To address this, we will test: 1) that a social network-focused SMA intervention based in primary care is feasible and acceptable among South Asians with prediabetes/type 2 diabetes, and 2) that health behaviors will also improve among participants’ social networks. The aims of this project are to: Aim 1: Implementation: Evaluate the preference, feasibility, and acceptability of social network-based (participant + social partner) versus individual-based (participant only) SMA ILI among SA immigrant participants with prediabetes/T2D through a 2-group pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].Leveraging a pragmatic design approach, simulating a natural experiment, I will recruit participants with prediabetes/T2D (n=48 total) to join one of 2 kinds of 8-session/16-week SMA intervention groups at an Emory Family Medicine clinic: (1) dyads (patient + social partner; mixed gender) or (2) men-only Primary Outcomes: recruitment and retention (preference and feasibility) and satisfaction (acceptability) Exploratory Outcomes: pre-post changes in biometric measurements (body weight, blood pressure, plasma lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], glycated hemoglobin), physical activity, and dietAim 2:  Broader reach through Social Networks: Assess the behavioral outcomes of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_279235]’ social networks as potential spi[INVESTIGATOR_39472].Conduct baseline and 6-month post-recruitment mappi[INVESTIGATOR_279236]’ (from Aim 2) self-identified social networks (n=5/participant) and assess the following: Primary outcomes: change in weight control practices (e.g. physical activity, calorie counting, etc.)

Exploratory outcomes: change in weight from baseline to 6 months3. BackgroundDiabetes is a major public health concern and challenging to address in current primary care practice . The burden of prediabetes and type II diabetes (T2D) in the US is growing rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375], with 
1.[ADDRESS_340829] in the US, and is a major contributor to morbidity and mortality.
2  T2D can lead to complications such as renal dysfunction, peripheral 
and autonomic neuropathy, vision problems, and cardiovascular disease.3  It is one of the top 
chronic conditions seen in primary care, accounting for over 15% of all outpatient primary care visits.
4 Over 50% of these visits are associated with multiple diagnoses, making it challenging for 
health professionals to address evidence-based T2D care in allotted 15 minute visits.5 As such, 
preventing or delaying the onset of T2D and its related complications are major public health and health system priorities.  
South Asians and Africans are growing immigrant groups at high risk for diabetes in the US. 
South Asian (SA) (ancestry originating from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and other parts of South Asia) and Sub-Saharan African immigrant groups make up two of the fastest growing immigrant groups in the US.
[ADDRESS_340830] higher rates of T2D and cardiovascular disease than whites.7–[ADDRESS_340831]: higher rates of hypertension,
74 dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], and insulin resistance.10–12 SAs 
report low levels of physical activity, and the diet of the SA migrant population is low in fiber and is often high in fat and sugar.
13–[ADDRESS_340832] worse glycemic control over time, even when the processes of care are similar.17,18  
Cumulatively, these findings in SA immigrant communities challenge the well-accepted 
“healthy immigrant effect” phenomenon (that immigrants are on average healthier than native-born persons), suggesting that more tailored T2D prevention and management strategies are greatly needed to narrow the disparities in outcomes between these and other US populations.
25,26
Intensive lifestyle interventions (ILIs) can improve diabetes self-management and health outcomes. Six large trials showed that intensive lifestyle interventions (ILIs), group-based 
programs designed to promote weight loss through a combination of diet, activity, and behavior change, decrease T2D incidence in people with prediabetes and reduced complications among people with T2D.
27–31 Two of these studies, the Diabetes Prevention 
Program (DPP) in the US and the Finnish DPP, showed a >50% reduction in T2D incidence in study participants in the ILI group compared to those in the control group.
27,[ADDRESS_340833]-effective.33–[ADDRESS_340834] for intensive lifestyle interventions for T2D prevention, 
Protocol Title :  Better Together: A patient-centered approach to improve diabetes among

Page 6 of 26 Protocol Version: V. 3.2 2/5/2025
uptake of men in such programs is low, ranging from 20-40%.27,38–40  Immigrant men in 
particular, may face additional barriers to access such programs due to poor healthcare access (lack of health insurance and no usual source of care), compared to immigrant women and US-born men.
41,42 Men are less likely than women to identify disease prevention strategies and 
lifestyle as influencing their health.43  
Preliminary data from my qualitative study in the SA Muslim immigrant community  in 
Atlanta suggests that immigrant men do not prioritize lifestyle change, citing a lack of perceived 
control to make decisions about what is eaten in the home.  One male focus group participant remarked, “If my wife tells me to eat, I have to eat. I have no choice.”  At the same time, spouses and family members can provide motivation for healthy lifestyle choices.  Another male participant noted, “I think husband and wife it does [motivates] automatically. Like the other day I came home and my wife was walking outside in the subdivision and she told me, "Do you want to join me for half an hour?" So let me go and join. Part of the kinda bonding.” 
 Strategies to improve the reach of diabetes prevention and management programs for 
men, particularly immigrant men, are needed and our data suggest that engagement of social networks, particularly family and other household members is important.

45 Moreover, social networks, 
participation through social support, may be able to be leveraged to improve health behaviors. In a number of studies, participants with high levels of social support were more engaged in health behavior changes, and social support has been shown to improve patient activation for behavior change.

ILI were more likely to lose >5% of their body weight and engage in positive dietary changes, when compared to control group untreated spouses.
[ADDRESS_340836] not explored the potential for 
“collateral health effects” of interventions–for example, people who are socially connected with each other.
52  Interventions that ignore participant’s social structure may overlook the 
potentially valuable support created by [CONTACT_31806]’s social context (e.g., helpi[INVESTIGATOR_279237]). Not engaging with social connections might even increase the barriers to behavior change as social connections may influence unhealthy lifestyle choices. Family members and friends can potentially be negative influences, hindering a patient’s health goal.
53,[ADDRESS_340837] identified cultural and family priorities as barriers

62 A study of African immigrant 
offspring, note that social and religious gatherings are central part of their culture, and foods, often high in oils and starches, are central to these celebrations.
63 Thus, these cultural and social 
influences shared among SA and African immigrants may be better addressed in an ILI that targets participants and their social influencers.
Shared medical appointments (SMAs) may be a model to incorporate the power of social 
networks for intensive lifestyle education delivery .  Group-based clinic visits, such as SMAs are 
a promising, sustainable strategy to increase patient access by [CONTACT_238389] a larger volume of patients in shorter a time frame and increase efficiency of the time health professionals spend with patients.  In this model, individuals with a similar medical condition participate in a longitudinal multidisciplinary group visit with a portion of the visit dedicated to personalized care.  The visits generally involves 12 to 16 patients in a 1 to 2 hour visit in which a portion of the visit is facilitated by a team (for example a physician/nurse/advanced practice provider/nutritionist) in a group setting and a portion is individualized for each patient.
[ADDRESS_340839] been shown to be feasible in several 
chronic health conditions, including heart failure and diabetes (T2D) self-care, and are associated with lower direct medical costs and higher guideline adherence in T2D care.
5,41 Furthermore, 
these visits are reimbursed by [CONTACT_279259], creating a sustainable approach to deliver ILI curriculum. 
Yet, to date the SMA model does not incorporate patients’ health influencers, who may be critical in providing support to initiate and sustain behavior change and have not targeted the specific needs of immigrant men. 
Preliminary/Relevant Data
In our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we focused on a dyad-based group ILI with SA Muslims.  We 
successfully recruited 7 patients and their support partners in 5 days, using physician referrals and chart review, supporting feasibility of the proposed study.  For those that were called and declined participation, 30% reported that their support partner, typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] a spouse, could not commit to attend the sessions. Of the 7 patients enrolled, 3 were men, and their support partners included 1 adult son and 2 wives.  Of the 4 female patients, support partners included 3 husbands and 1 female friend.  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_279238] (43%), and in most dyads (6 of 7), both partners have prediabetes or T2D, and the mean age of participants is

51 (age range 23-72). Retention of participants is >80% retention at midpoint of the 16-week, bi-weekly intervention.  Survey data suggest high levels of satisfaction with the group-based format (5/5 on Likert-like scales) and engagement of the support partner (5/5).  
Supporting our choice to offer a male-only group, in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_279239] a predominantly African American group in [LOCATION_001] City, in which participants in an all-male group program lost a mean 4% of body weight, participants reported interest for both male-only or mixed gender groups.
39,[ADDRESS_340840] been identified as key factors in considering how to tailor interventions for racial/ethnic minority populations .
69,70 Our study 
addresses these gaps by [CONTACT_279260], feasibility, and acceptability for an SMA intervention based in primary 
care and developed with user-driven input and changes in healthy lifestyle practices among 
participants’ social networks. The findings of this study should have relevance to other 
chronic conditions, such as hypertension and cardiovascular disease, and for other socially-
cohesive subpopulations (e.g., Latinos, Native Americans, and rural whites).
4. Study Endpoints 
This study has [ADDRESS_340841] is a culturally tailored lifestyle intervention for South 
Asian immigrants in Atlanta.  The second aim examines spi[INVESTIGATOR_279240]’ self-identified spi[INVESTIGATOR_39472].  The endpoints are as follows:
Aim 1: 
Primary Outcomes : I will examine outcomes in both patients ( P) and social partner ( SP) for 
those in the mixed gender arm of the intervention Specifically, I will report on:
1.Recruitment and retention (preferences and feasibility) : preference by [CONTACT_279261] (e.g. which group of the study are participants choosing), rate of recruitment, 
number of sessions attended; for dyads, this would include sessions attended together 
and separately, over the 6 month study period
2.Participant perceptions of ILI (acceptability):  questionnaires at conclusion of program to 
evaluate: (1) satisfaction with the program and (2) suggestions for program 
improvement 
Exploratory Outcomes : To evaluate changes in T2D-related risk behaviors in Ps, changes in the 
following at baseline (BL), 6 months (conclusion of ILI), and 6 months will be measured:
Protocol Title :  Better Together: A patient-centered approach to improve diabetes among 
immigrant communities
Page 9 of 26 Protocol Version: V. 3.2 2/5/2025
1.Anthropometric measurements (body weight, body mass index (BMI), abdominal waist 
circumference) : Weight will be measured in kilograms using a calibrated, standardized 
scale, and height will be measured using a standardized stadiometer. BMI will be 
calculated using the standard formula. Waist circumference will be measured by [CONTACT_279262].113 
2.Hemoglobin A1c (A1c):  Point-of-care testing (POCT) with well-validated clinical 
instrument
3.Blood pressure:  Blood pressure will be measured using standard procedures with a 
manual cuff
4.Plasma lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805]:  POCT with well-validated clinical instrument
5.Physical activity:  Participants will be asked to keep daily activity logs (e.g. minutes of 
exercise and types of exercises performed daily)
6.Diet:  Changes in diet will be measured using the Rapid Eating and Activity Assessment 
for Participants short version (REAP-S), a validated short food frequency questionnaire 
(FFQ).71(p) 
Aim 2: Assess the behavioral outcomes of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_279241]’ 
social contacts as potential spi[INVESTIGATOR_39472].
Primary outcomes  will include change from baseline to 6- months in weight control practices 
(e.g. physical activity, calorie counting, etc.), based on a 30-item questionnaire previously used 
in a similar intervention.51 
5. Study Intervention / Design 
Describe the study intervention that is being evaluated, and/or the nature of 
interactions proposed.
6. Procedures Involved
Aim 1:
3.1 Overview: To evaluate preferences, feasibility, and acceptability of a virtual SMA ILI for SA 
and WA immigrant men on health behaviors and glucose control in a pre-post pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].  
Participants with T2D or prediabetes will be given a choice of 1 of 2 groups of the study: (1) 
dyads (patient + support partner; mixed gender) or (2) men-only (no social partner). Groups will be stratified by [CONTACT_124940], thus a total of 4 groups.  
3.2 Study Design and Setting: This is a pragmatic, pre-post, pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].  Participants will meet in 
groups of 12 for the SMA intervention at the conference room at the Emory Family Medicine 
Center in Dunwoody, Georgia.  The group size of 12 is the recommended size for SMAs.37 
Leveraging a pragmatic, quasi-experimental design, simulating a natural experiment, the ILI will occur on a rolling basis, as recruitment is completed by [CONTACT_19313].  
3.3 Intervention Development:  The intervention will be refined based on feedback from the 
qualitative data analyses from Aim 1.  Based on previous work by [CONTACT_2296], the intervention 
was modified to be delivered in group telehealth sessions over [ADDRESS_340842] 
Protocol Title :  Better Together: A patient-centered approach to improve diabetes among 
immigrant communities
Page 10 of 26 Protocol Version: V. 3.2 2/5/[ADDRESS_340843] convenient to participants and a time that can be integrated into the 
routine clinic schedule, likely a weekend morning or weekday evening. Based on my pi[INVESTIGATOR_279242], the sessions will be modeled on the Diabetes 
Prevention Program27,72,73 and will include:
•Basic skills in healthy eating and physical activity, tailored for SA and WA immigrants
•Copi[INVESTIGATOR_279243] (e.g. social or family situations that 
are specific SA and WA immigrant groups)
•Building social support so dyads/participants can learn effective ways to support one 
another to make and sustain health behaviors.
3.4 Recruitment: I and a research assistant will identify eligible participants through chart 
review and referrals from the Emory Family Medicine Center.  We will contact [CONTACT_279263], explain details of the study, obtain verbal consent, and recruit the patient and social partner, if choosing the dyad group (we will suggest who to include, based on our qualitative work) to participate.  I anticipate screening 200 patient charts to identify a total of 48 eligible, consenting participants.Eligibility (Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria):  Based on reviews done at screening, men and 
women >18 years of age with a diagnosis of T2D or prediabetes will be invited to participate.
3.5 Enrollment: Individuals and their support person (if choosing the mixed gender arm) meeting 
eligibility criteria will receive detailed study information and be invited to participate. Informed 
consent forms will be available in English.  All subjects will be reassured that their participation is voluntary and they are free to withdraw at any time, without consequences to their existing care. Participants will receive $20 gift cards for each data collection survey, and a total fo $75 if they complete all surveys and attend all sessions as a token of appreciation.
The following additional protocol adds a qualitative element to Aim 1, primary outcome 2: 
Participant perceptions of ILI (acceptability): questionnaires at conclusion of program to evaluate: (1) satisfaction with the program and (2) suggestions for program improvement
We will employ a type of in-depth interviewing style known as semi-structured interviews. 
Semi-structured interviews and semi-structured interview guides allow some flexibility in the administration of the guide, as compared to a structured interview guide. This will allow for in-depth data collection to generate valid data on this topic. 
The participant list will be pulled from the Better Together study and the community health 
workers from the Better Together study. Ten people from the Better Together study and their support person will be interviewed as dyads. The people selected for the interviews will be done purposively. We will aim to have balance in gender of the participant with diabetes – aiming for 5 male participants and 5 female participants. Some questions in the attached interview guide pertain to the individual with diabetes, some will be directed at the support person, and some will

Page 11 of 26 Protocol Version: V. 3.2 2/5/[ADDRESS_340844] data saturation to be achieved with the 13 interviews and will then qualitatively 
analyze these data. Interviews will be transcribed using rev.com and a deductive coding process rooted in social support theory will be employed. A codebook will be developed with the initial set of codes matching the social support constructs. Inductive codes will be drawn from the emerging stories and themes from the interviews as needed. A second coder will independently code all transcripts. 
Aim 2: 
4.1 Overview:   To test the hypothesis that a social network-focused ILI SMA will have spi[INVESTIGATOR_279244]’ social networks I will prospectively assess the influence of 
behavioral weight loss treatment on participant’s self-identified social contacts who influence their lifestyle practices. I will conduct baseline and 6-month post-recruitment mappi[INVESTIGATOR_279236]’ (from Aim 2) self-identified social contacts (n=5/participant). Based on the high rates of cardio-metabolic risk factors in SA and WA immigrant communities, we anticipate that participants’ social contacts will have elevated cardio-metabolic risk at baseline.
59,61,74–76
4.2 Participants:  We will utilize an egocentric approach . During enrollment of participants 
(egos) in Aim 2, we will use a name [CONTACT_279280] (listing 5 alters).77  Alters will be asked to 
participate in surveys as baseline and at 6-months. Alters will be excluded if they lack proficiency in English, are < 18 years of age, or cannot provide written consent. 4.3 Study Design:  Paper surveys and weight assessments at baseline and at 6 months months 
will be conducted via home visits with alters (if geographically feasible). The alters will receive 
$20 for each assessment.  7. Data and Specimen BankingNo specimens will be stored. 
•All hard copi[INVESTIGATOR_279245] a locked 
file cabinet in a locked cabinet at the Emory Family Medicine Clinic at Dunwoody.  
•Electronic data will be stored on a password protected, Emory University laptop, in a password

•Every measure will be taken to prevent loss/theft of data, including limiting the number of 
people who have access to files and not allowing hard copi[INVESTIGATOR_279246].
•We will make the data of our work available through presentations of the results, including the 
methods, results, and plans for further investigation at regional, national, and international meetings and conferences for researchers and clinicians. We will also work with our community advisors to disseminate the results to local communities and other stakeholders with interest in our findings.
•Publication of data shall occur during the project, if appropriate, or at the end of the project, 
consistent with standard scientific processes. We have budgeted for publication in open access journals to improve availability of our findings. Following NIH policy, the research data documenting, supporting, and validating research findings will be made available after the main findings from the final research data set have been accepted for publication via the procedure below. We will ensure adequate protections of the privacy of human subjects by [CONTACT_279264] :  Better Together: A patient-centered approach to improve diabetes among

The only contingency on the use of the data will be ethical guidelines (e.g., requirement for completion of appropriate human subjects’ protection training courses, secure data storage). The NIH will be notified of any data transmissions.  De-identified data will be shared with requesting researchers via secure, electronic mail.
8. Sharing of Results with Participants
See above, study findings will be made available via community stakeholders, presentations, 
and publications.  Participants pre-post biometric results will be shared with individual participants at the end of study.
9. Study Timelines
The timeline of the proposed Study 2 and 3 (Aims 1 and 2) is summarized in the table below.  The timeline begins after notice of award.

Based on reviews done at screening, men with a diagnosis of T2D or prediabetes will be invited 
to participate if they meet all of the following inclusion criteria: (1) age > 18 years; (2) confirmed diagnosis of prediabetes or T2D (documented A1c of ≥ 5.7% or FBG of >100); (3) a 
family member or peer willing to participate and attend all sessions as a social partner (if enrolling in dyad arm); and (4) proficiency in English(if in dyad, at least one member of each dyad), and (5) willingness to provide written consent.  Individuals will be excluded from participation if they have any of the following: (1) type 1 diabetes or diabetes secondary to other conditions (e.g. steroid-induced, pancreatic insufficiency, or chemotherapy-induced); (2) malignancy or life-threatening illness with life expectancy of <5 years; (3) end-stage disease or serious illness that prohibits participation (e.g. end-stage renal disease or class IV congestive heart failure); (4) inability to perform unsupervised physical activity; (5) pregnancy; (6) diagnosed cognitive deficits or limited decision-making capacity; (7) alcohol or substance abuse; or (8) homelessness or no fixed address.
Aim 2:
For the second aim, participants will be identified through participants in Aim 1.  The eligibility criteria are as follows:

12. Local Number of Participants
For Aim 1, our goal is to recruit 48 participants.  We anticipate screening 200 patient charts to identify a total of 48 eligible, consenting participants.  For Aim 2, we anticipate that each participant will identify 4 social contacts (i.e. alters), and these will mostly consist of household members, based on a previous study.
[ADDRESS_340851] 3 alters per 
participant to compete baseline and follow up surveys.  A previous study of SA’s in an urban setting in India reported a 97% response rate.
77 This would provide a sample size of 140 (97% of 
48 participants x 3 alters/participant).13. Recruitment MethodsAll recruitment will be done via chart review of patients seen at the Emory Dunwoody Family practice, via chart review.  Patients who met eligibility criteria from chart review will be contact[CONTACT_279265] (See phone scripts). For Aim 2, participants will be identified from participants in Aim 1.
Incentives: For Aim 1: All subjects will be reassured that their participation is voluntary and they 
are free to withdraw at any time, without consequences to their existing care. Participants will receive $75 gift cards for completing all surveys and attending sessions.
For Aim 2: Paper surveys and weight assessments at baseline and at 6 months will be conducted 
via home visits with alters (if geographically feasible). Participants will receive $[ADDRESS_340852] clinical technique for point of care lab collection, thus this is an acceptable risk in the population.  There is a risk of loss of confidentiality of study data. We will, however, take measures to ensure that this does not happen by [CONTACT_70731]: storing data on a locked, password protected electronic file and using a study ID number in place of personal information when possible.

Data Analysis, Management and ConfidentialityAim 1 Analysis: Power calculation: The sample size (12 participants per group) was chosen based on recommendations in the literature for optimal size for a SMA model.
78,[ADDRESS_340854] a similar difference with an alpha (Type I error rate) of 0.05 and a beta (Type II error rate) of 0.20, would require 37 participants per group.  This is beyond the scope of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]/training award. Instead, we will accept an alpha of 0.20 and a beta of 0.40, which defines a targeted recruitment of 11 participants per group (n=44); thus our target of 12 per group (n=48) would power us for these parameters. The Emory Family Medicine Clinic sees approximately 11,000 unique patients annually.  We conservatively estimate that approximately 10% are of WA or SA origin and 30% of this population will have T2D or prediabetes, thus we would have 330 eligible participants from which to recruit 48.  This number is feasible as it would require enrollment of 6 participants weekly for 8 weeks.   Quantitative Data Analysis: De-identified, quantitative data will be entered into a Redcap database. Regular data audits will ensure the accuracy of the electronic data. Analyses will be conducted using the Stata 15 statistical software package. Descriptive analysis will be performed for all baseline variables, and outliers will be investigated for data errors. A probability of <0.[ADDRESS_340855]-intervention changes (comparing baseline to 6-month follow up). However, modeling will be limited by [CONTACT_279266]. All data will be presented before and after adjustment for confounding and interaction (including, for example, age, gender, and education). Primary Outcome Analyses: Preferences will be assessed by [CONTACT_279267].  Feasibility will be assessed by [CONTACT_279268], number of sessions attended by [CONTACT_4317] (for dyad arm, will assess P and SP individually and together).  Acceptability will be assessed by [CONTACT_279269]-like scales of satisfaction with each session and overall intervention. Exploratory Analyses:  Participant anthropometric and biochemical markers will be assessed individually and modeled over time using hierarchical

modeling to account for clustering.  Changes in glycemic control and lipi[INVESTIGATOR_81059] 6  months for P will be done using similar methods as above to account for clustering; for dyad arm, if SP also has diabetes or prediabetes, their change in glycemic and lipid control will be assessed individually and compared to their baseline measure. This pi[INVESTIGATOR_279248] a larger, pragmatic, randomized trial.Aim 3: Power calculation: We anticipate that each participant will identify 4 social contacts (i.e. alters), and these will mostly consist of household members, based on a previous study.
[ADDRESS_340856] 3 alters per participant to compete baseline and follow up surveys.  A previous study of SA’s in an urban setting in India reported a 97% response rate.
77 This would 
provide a sample size of 140 (97% of 48 participants x 3 alters/participant). Given, the small sample size of the intervention participants, we do not expect to be powered to find differences in weight loss practices among alters, however this data will provide a signal of spi[INVESTIGATOR_11036], pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299], and necessary training for the PI [INVESTIGATOR_8178] a larger fully powered study with a control group.Analysis: After appropriate data checks (as described in section 3.8 above), descriptive analyses will be performed for all baseline variables, and outliers will be investigated for data errors. Chi squared tests will be used to assess pre-post differences in WCSS items.  Partial correlations, controlling for relevant baseline values from egos and alters will be used to examine associations between egos and alters in changes in weight and behaviors (as assessed by [CONTACT_279270]).  When appropriate, hierarchical linear models will be created, to account for repeated measures in the same person and the clustering of alters by [CONTACT_279271], to look at baseline to 6-month changes in weight management behaviors.
All patient-related data will be held in confidence by [CONTACT_279272] a study ID number. Data will be stored and analyzed in a manner to preserve confidentiality; data will be de-identified and stored in a secured REDCap database with access limited to authorized personnel.  Source documents and paper documents will be stored in a locked drawer within another locked room; only authorized personnel will have access to these records.This study will comply with Emory’s Data Security Policy (http://it.emory.edu/security/security_awareness/encrypt.html ). All sensitive data and data 
that contains HIPAA identifiers will be stored on a hard drive, disk, or thumb drive that is 
encrypted, password-protected, and kept in a locked office. All data will be extracted and analyzed by [CONTACT_3476]. Only aggregate data will be printed or published. Once the study is complete all data will be destroyed.
18. Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety of Participants
In Study [ADDRESS_340857] (Aim 1), the intervention is an educational behavior change 
program that is based on the successful lifestyle principles tested in the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) study and the Action for Health in Diabetes (Look AHEAD) study. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_279249], we will engage an independent data safety and monitoring board (DSMB) for assistance with oversight. 
Protocol Title :  Better Together: A patient-centered approach to improve diabetes among 
immigrant communities
Page 17 of 26 Protocol Version: V. 3.2 2/5/2025
At each in-person session, participants will be asked about any potential adverse effects (e.g., 
injuries, chest pain associated with exercise) and report these to the study investigators. These adverse events will then be reported to the single institutional review board (IRB) and the DSMB. Detailed procedures for the notification of any abnormal findings of clinical relevance as well as non-emergency and emergency referrals will be developed and implemented. As part of the informed consent process, individuals will be informed of their rights regarding injury sustained during study procedures and if study-related injury does occur, participants will be offered treatment according to prevailing local health policies. 
DSMB – The PI [INVESTIGATOR_279250], to serve as a DSMB for the study. The DSMB will be charged with external oversight, monitoring conduct, data integrity, and patient safety. Prior to recruitment for Aim 1, the DSMB will review the protocol and monitoring plans. Following this, the DSMB will mainly monitor for adequate recruitment milestones, the occurrence of adverse events related to participation in the study, and for effectiveness (or lack thereof) of the intervention. 
The following adverse events will be monitored: death, dropout, clinical deterioration, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_279251], other major surgical procedures (e.g., amputation), development of serious substance abuse, and emergence of new medical diagnoses posing significant risk to subjects. 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_279252] 6-month intervals thereafter 
until the participants that were recruited last have completed their 6-month follow-up visits. The DSMB meetings will be via teleconference and the study has budgeted for honoraria for the DSMB members. At these meetings, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_279253]. Any events arising in the interim between DSMB meetings will be communicated to the DSMB electronically. Following DSMB meetings, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_279254], the IRB, and the National Institutes of Health. 
In the unlikely event that we observe a high number of serious adverse events (e.g., heart attacks) 
that are deemed related to the intervention, premature discontinuation of the study may be recommended by [CONTACT_279273] [INVESTIGATOR_279255]. Similarly, if an individual is hurt by [CONTACT_1758], and the intervention is linked and decreases the likelihood of the participant completing the study, provisions will be made to remove him/her from the study.
Aim 2:
Participants in Study Record 3 (Aim 3) are not participating in an intervention, and are completing a pre-post paper survey and weight measurements.  There is no potential for side effects or injury. As such, a data safety and monitoring board (DSMB) is not applicable to this study aim.
19. Provisions to Protect the Privacy Interests of Participants and Confidentiality of 
Participants’ identifiable data
Protocol Title :  Better Together: A patient-centered approach to improve diabetes among 
immigrant communities
Page 18 of 26 Protocol Version: V. 3.2 2/5/[ADDRESS_340858] (HIPAA).
We anticipate that all subjects will have the capacity to give informed consent.  All patient-related data will be held in confidence by [CONTACT_279272] a study ID number. Data will be stored and analyzed in a manner to preserve confidentiality; data will be de-identified and stored in a secured REDCap database with access limited to authorized personnel.  Source documents and paper documents will be stored in a locked drawer within another locked room; only authorized personnel will have access to these records.  All study related data will be destroyed within 3 years of study completion. 
Economic Burden to Participants
All study related costs are covered by [CONTACT_1758], we do not anticipate economic burden to participants.  We will offer sessions during hours that are convenient to participants to avoid disruption of work schedules. 
20. Consent Process
• Informed consent will be obtained in person through review and written signature [CONTACT_279281]; this will occur just prior to the focus group discussion.• No waivers will be required• No vulnerable populations are included•We aim to ensure comprehension by [CONTACT_279274]-English-Speaking Participants   
•Given the limited funding of this proposed study, all focus groups discussion will 
be conducted in English.  
•English proficiency is included in the inclusion criteria.
21. Setting
For Aim 1, all research related activities will take place at Emory Family Medicine Clinic 
at Dunwoody.  For Aim 2, when geographically feasible, surveys and weight assessments will done via home visit.  If this is not feasible, this will be conducted remotely via phone or an approved video conference platform.

Diagnosis and main criteria 
for inclusion  • Patients  >18 years of age  
• Patients with histological or cytologically documented HCC 
(Documentation of original biopsy for diagnosis is acceptable 
if tumor tissue is unavailable)  or clinical diagnosis by 
[CONTACT_281397]. For subjects without cirrhosis , histologic al confirmation is mandatory.
 
• Patients must have at least one tumor lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension according to RECIST  
• The target lesion has not been previously treated with local therapy (such as surgery, radiation thera py, hepatic arterial 
therapy, chemoembolization, radiofrequency ablation, percutaneous ethanol injection or cryoablation).  
• Patients who have received local therapy, such as surgery, radiation therapy, hepatic arterial embolization, chemoembolization, radiofrequency ablation, percutaneous ethanol injection or cryoablation are eligible  if the  previously 
treated lesions have progressed or recurred can be identified as target lesions.  Local therapy must have been completed at 
least 4 weeks prior to the baseline scan.  
• Patients who have received Yttrium -90 microspheres are not 
eligible.  
• Patients who have an ECOG PS  ≤ 1  
• Patients who are categorized under BCLC -C stage 
• Cirrhotic status of Child -Pugh class A. Child- Pugh status 
should be calculated based on clinical findings and laboratory results during the screening period.  
• The following laboratory parameters:  
 Platelet count ≥  60 x 10
9/L  
 Hemoglobin ≥  8.5 g/dL  
 Total bilirubin ≤  2.5 mg/dl  
 Alanine transaminase (ALT) and AST ≤  5 x upper 
limit of normal  
 Serum creatinine ≤  1.5 x the upper limit of normal 
Prothrombin time (PT)- international normalized ratio (INR) 
≤ 2.3 or PT ≤ 6 seconds above control.  
    
June 19, 2015   Version : 9 Page:   [ADDRESS_343039].   All statistical analyses will 
be performed using SAS (version 9.3; SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC).  For the primary analysis,  all patients receive d treatment will 
be included the analysis  for toxicity.   Continuous parameters will 
be summarized using descriptive statistics, such as number of patients, mean, standard deviation, median and range.  The toxicities will be summarized with frequency and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) by [CONTACT_24975], severity and their relationship to the treatment. Assuming a 30% of grade 3 or 4 
treatment related toxic ity rate , with 20 patients, the 95% CI will 
be (9.9%, 50.1%).  
For the secondary analysis, the Kaplan- Meier metho d will be 
applied to estimate the probabilities of overall survival and progression- free survival as well as the median OS duration and 
PFS duration. The Log rank test will be used to compare the two time-to-event outcomes between patient subgroups.

Imaging Requirements   
• Triple Phase CT  – To determine liver volume measurement, 
identify hepatic vascular anatomy to determine TheraSphere dosimetry  
 
• Spi[INVESTIGATOR_281375]/pelvis  –performed with cuts of [ADDRESS_343040] 1.1 
criteria .  
 
• Spi[INVESTIGATOR_281376]  –performed with cuts of [ADDRESS_343041]  1.1 criteria.  
 
• MRI can replace CT scans; however, the same imaging 
modality should be used for all images in an individual patient throughout the study  
 
• Images for efficacy assessments will require a duplicate set of 
images in DICOM format  
 
• Hepatic angiography and 99mTc -MAA – selective celiac and 
superior mesenteric arteriograms are needed to evaluate the hepatic arterial anatomy for the whole liver, as well as evaluation of potential sources of extra -hepatic blood supply 
to tumors. Repeat 99mTc -MAA may be needed to estimate 
cumulative lung shunt or re -asses GI flow.

Biomarker Variables  In addition to assessing the baseline plasma IGF -1 level, we will 
run exploratory biomarker studies utilizing available blood and  
plasma. A blood sample will be obtained from all patients at Screening. Plasma samples for biomarker evaluation will be obtained from all patients at s ix independent time points: (1) 
Screening; (2) Cycle 1/Day 1; (3) Cycle 2/Day 1; (4) Cycle 3/Day 
1; (5) Pre -Yttrium- 90, on the same day; and ( 6) End of 
Treatment. Plasma from patients on treatment days will be obtained from blood samples harvested prior to drug administration. These biomarker studies are optional and donation of biomarker samples is not required for participation in the clinical trial.  
The planned biomarker study is designed to measure the correlation between plasma IGF -[ADDRESS_343042] patients’ survival and outcome.  
Data from this biomarker analysis may be correlated with various 
other data obtained in this study ( e.g., clinical activity, toxicity).

1 Introduction  
 
More than 80% of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients are not candidates for 
curative treatments, such as resection or liver transplant, the outcome of HCC patients remained very poor. Recently, sorafenib —a multitarget tyrosine kinase 
inhibitor —was found to improve survival of patients with Child -Pugh A unresectable 
HCC. The median overall survival (OS) was 10.7 months for patients on sorafenib vs 7.9 months for placebo, P = .0006, and median time -to-progression (TTP) was 5.5 
months for patients on sorafenib vs 2.8 months for placebo, (P <0.001). Notably, out 
of all patients under the SHARP trial, 421 patients had extrahepatic spread (EHS) and/or macrovascular invasion (MVI ) (Sorafenib=209, placebo=212). For patients 
with EHS and/or MVI (S orafenib vs placebo), OS was 8.9 vs 6.7 months (HR: 0.77; 
95% CI: 0.60, 0.99) and TTP was 4.1 vs 2.7 months (HR: 0.64; 95% CI: 0.48, 0.84). (Sherman M, et al. 44
th  ASCO Annual Meeting).  
Considering that the cause of death of HCC patients with extrahepatic spread is 
mainly intrahepatic HCC progression or hepatic failure, rather than extrahepatic metastasis, the intentional addition of an intra -arterial local therapy modality, such as 
    
June 19, 2015   Version : 9 Page:   [ADDRESS_343047] been available on this approach until now.  
1.1 Background  and Rationale  
TheraSphere®, a localized, minimally embolic therapy, capi[INVESTIGATOR_281379] Y ttrium -90 microspheres, a source of 
beta energy, via the hepatic artery to the tumor bed. The distribution of blood flow is 3 to 7 times greater within  the tumor than the surrounding noncancerous tissue. 
Consequently, there is preferential delivery of microspheres to the tumor capi[INVESTIGATOR_281380]- tumor parenchyma. The ability to concentrate radioactive 
microspheres within the tumor leads to an "inside -out" radiation, which in turn exerts 
a local tumoricidal effect . 
 Preliminary data:  Treatment details were retrospectively collected for a cohort of 
patients with a dvanced multifocal HCC at MD Anderson Cancer Center  between 
January 2008 & May 2010 who received systemic sorafenib followed by [CONTACT_281398] Y ttrium- 90 microspheres . 19 patients met the criteria (BCLC stage B=3 
patients, and BCLC stage C=16 patients), (Child -Pugh A=16, and Child- Pugh B=3). 
Response rate was: PR 21% ( n=4) and 79% (n=15) of these patients had SD by 
[CONTACT_13407]. Median TTP per liver tumors was 7.3 months, and OS was 10.3 months. Grade 3 /[ADDRESS_343048] Y90 
microsphere therapy. Significant adverse events were: GI ulcer (1), pancreatitis (1), lymphopenia (1), and mucositis (2)  from which all patients recovered uneventfully.  
It will be also important in the future to determine how to mo st effectively integrate 
molecular assays that assess the likelihood of therapeutic benefit into clinical practice. Therefore, we plan to assess potential biological markers candidates to help predict response or survival benefit to this approach. Insulin like growth factor- 1 (IGF -1) is 
produced predominantly in the liver, and our recent study showed that pre -treatment 
plasma IGF -1 may correlate with patients’ survival, and hence improve the prognostic 
ability of the Cancer of the Liver Italian Program (CLIP) score, and Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging . IGF -1 significantly correlated with the 
clinicopathologic features. With an optimal IGF -1 cut point of 26 ng/mL, the overall 
survival for patients with IGF -1 >26 was 17.7 months (95% CI of 13.6, 22.8), and for 
IGF-1 ≤ 26 (60/288 patients) was 5.8 months (95% CI of 4.0, 12.5), p- value<0.0001. 
Additionally, we have accrued 20 patients on the current study with a primary aim to evaluate the safety  of the combination of sorafenib and Yttrium- 90; advers e events 
(NCI -CTAE v 4.0) and found no grade 4 or 5 reactions. A few grade 3 reactions 
occurred in the form of: liver enzymes increase (ALT=[ADDRESS_343049]=3 patients, and bilirubin = 1 patient), Fatigue (=2), and 1 patient for each of the following: enceph alopathy, hypertension, hyponatremia, hypophosphatemia, thrombocytopenia, 
maculo -papular rash, weight loss and vomiting.

1.2 Sorafenib  
1.2.1 Preclinical  
Sorafenib is a multikinase inhibitor which effects specific targets that are imperative for tumor cell prolifera tion including the serine/threonine kinases c -Raf and B -Raf (IC
50 6 and 25 
nM respectively) and the receptor tyrosine kinase RET, Flt -3 and c -Kit (IC 50 47, 33 and 68 
nM respectively)  [1]. Sorafenib has potent activity against receptor tyrosine kinases important 
in tumor angiogenesis including the vascular endothelial growth factor recepto r family 
(VEGFR1, - 2, -3; IC 50 26, 90 and 20 nM respectively ) and platelet derived growth factor -
beta (PDGFR- ί; IC 50 57 nM). In cellular mechanistic (on target) assays, sorafenib was found 
to be a potent inhibitor of VEGFR -2, VEGFR- 3, and PDGFR and Flt -[ADDRESS_343050] effects on 
tumor growth through its inhibition of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway and on the anti -
angiogenic activity of the compound.  Sorafenib demonstrates broad ant i-tumor activity in 
human tumor xenograft models of liver, kidney, lung, prostate, breast and leukemia. In human hepatocellular tumor cell lines, sorafenib potently inhibited cellular proliferations, Raf/MEK/ERK signaling and induced apoptosis. Sorafenib h as potent activity against human 
tumor xenograft model of hepatocellular carcinoma with tumor stabilization seen at moderate 
doses and partial tumor regressions observed at higher doses.  
1.2.2 Clinical experience  
Sorafenib as a single agent has been evaluated g lobally in multiple Phase I and II trials in 
various malignancies. Two pi[INVESTIGATOR_281381] -institutional, single agent, randomized, 
placebo -controlled trials led to sorafenib’s approval for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) (US 
2005, EU 2006) worldwide and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (2007) worldwide.  
TARGET ( Treatment Approaches in Renal Cancer G lobal Evaluation Trial) used a 
randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled design to assess the efficacy of sorafenib in 
903 subjects with advanced RCC who re ceived 1 prior systemic regimen.  The formal 
analysis of PFS using data available as of 28 Jan 2005 demonstrated a statistically significant 
doubling of PFS in subjects treated with sorafenib as well as a favorable safety profile of sorafenib in advanced R CC subjects.  [2] This trial supported the US and European Union 
approvals of sorafenib in RCC, followed by [CONTACT_281399], the first approved a gent for this disease in over a decade.  
Clinical results in Phase I studies of sorafenib as a single agent were suggestive of a therapeutic effect in HCC and led to the design of a single arm  Phase II study ([ZIP_CODE]), in which 137 subjects with advanced, in operable HCC Child -Pugh classes A and B were treated.  
The results of this study (median TTP of 5.5 months by [CONTACT_281400] 9.2 months), provided the basis for the randomized, placebo- controlled 
Phase III study in su bjects with advanced HCC Child -Pugh class A (SHARP, S orafenib H CC 
Assessment  Randomized P rotocol).  This large (602 subjects) Phase III study was the first 
international, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study to demonstrate a 
statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in OS in advanced HCC subjects treated with sorafenib over placebo. [3]  Of the 299 sorafenib subjects valid for ITT 
analysis, the median OS was 10.7 months in the sorafenib group and 7.9 months in  the 303 
    
June 19, 2015   Version : 9 Page:   15 of 50 
 
 
subjects randomized to the placebo group (hazard ratio in the sorafenib group, 0.69; 95% confidence interval, 0.55 to 0.87; p<0.001.  The nominal alpha for this analysis was 0.0077 according to the pre -specified O'Brien -Fleming -type alpha spending function.  Therefore, 
sorafenib had a statistically significant effect on prolonging overall survival.  This significant survival benefit represented a 31% reduction in risk of death (or 44% improvement in OS) in subjects treated with sorafenib versus tho se treated with placebo. 
As of [ADDRESS_343051] been exposed to sorafenib either as single agent or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents in Phase I/II/III studies.  Sorafenib has been generally well tolerated at a dose of 400 mg po twice daily (bid).  The most common drug related adverse events have included hand-foot skin reaction, diarrhea, fatigue, hypertension, pain and rash.  Grade 3 and 4 drug -related 
adverse events are uncommon.   There was no evidence of cumulative toxicity and the 
majority of the adverse events were reversible.  
 
2.    TheraSphere  
2.1 General Device Description  
 
TheraSphere® consists of insoluble glass microspheres in which yttrium -90 is an integral 
component of the glass. The sphere diameter ranges from 20 to 30 μm with 22,000 to 73,000 
microspheres per milligram. TheraSphere is available in six dose sizes (3 GBq , 5GBq, 7GBq, 
10GBq, 15GBq and 20 GBq) each supplied in 0.[ADDRESS_343052].  
 Yttrium- 90 is a pure beta emitter which decays to stable zirconium -90 with a physical half -
life of 64.2 hours. The average energy of the beta emissions from yttrium -90 is 0.9367 MeV 
with mean tissue penetration of approximately 2.5 mm.  
TheraSphere is admi nistered through the hepatic artery which supplies blood to tumor tissue 
(the portal vein supplies blood to the normal hepatic tissue). The microspheres are trapped in the vasculature of the tumor due to arteriolar capi[INVESTIGATOR_281382] a loc al 
radiotherapeutic effect. In clinical use, the glass microspheres remain permanently trapped in the vasculature where the isotope decays to infinity leaving background radiation with no therapeutic value.  
2.2        Global Regulatory Status of Therasphe re 
 TheraSphere received a Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) from the [LOCATION_002] Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1999 (HDE H980006) and is currently approved for use in radiation treatment or as a neoadjuvant to surgery or transplantation in patients with

unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who can have placement of appropriately positioned hepatic arterial catheters. The device is also indicated for HCC patients with partial or branch portal vein thrombosis/occlusion, when clinical evaluation warrants the treatment. The current US package insert is provided in Appendix 1a.  
TheraSphere is approved for use in Europe for the treatment of hepatic neoplasia. TheraSphere is approved in Canada for the treatment of hepatic neoplasia in patients who have appropriately positioned arterial catheters. In addition, TheraSphere is available in Russia, India, South Africa and Kuwait for the treatment of hepatic neoplasia.  
2.3        Rationale  for the Treatment of  Hepatocel lular Carcinoma  
 According to the American Cancer Society, primary liver cancer is a major health problem worldwide. [ 4]  Globally, it is the fifth most commonly diagnosed cancer in men and eighth 
most common in women, with more than 700,[ADDRESS_343053] leading cause of cancer death in men and sixth among women. In North America and Western or Northern Europe, areas with historically low rates, the incidence of liver cancer is increasing, possibly due to increased prevalence  of hepatitis C.  
In 2007, the US FDA approved sorafenib tosylate (Nexavar®), a small molecule Raf kinase 
and VEGF receptor kinase inhibitor, for the treatment of patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).  [5] The approval was based on the results of an 
international, multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled trial (SHARP3 trial) 
in patients with unresectable, biopsy -proven hepatocellular carcinoma. [ 2]  Overall survival 
was the primary efficacy en dpoint. A total of 602 patients were randomized; 299 to sorafenib 
400 mg twice daily and 303 to matching placebo. Demographics and baseline disease characteristics were similar between the sorafenib and 
placebo groups. Prior treatments included surgical re sections (20 % ), locoregional therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] 
(including radiofrequency ablation, percutaneous ethanol injection and transarterial chemoembolization in 40 percent), radiotherapy (5 % ), and systemic therapy (4 % ).  
The trial was stopped following a pre -specified second interim analysis for survival 
disclosing a statistically significant advantage for sorafenib [median 10.7 vs. 7.9 months; HR: 0.69 (95 percent CI: 0.55, 0.87), p= 0.[ZIP_CODE]]. The final analysis of time -to-tumor progression 
(TTP) by [CONTACT_281401] a statistically significant improvement in TTP in the sorafenib group [median 5.5 vs. 2.8 months; HR: 0.58 (95 %  CI: 0.45, 0.74), p=0.000007]. 
Sorafenib is now suggested as the standard- of-care (SOC) therapy for patients with advanced 
HCC, the patients classified as BCLC C according to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) classification system.  [6]  Sorafenib is included in the NCCN Clinical Practice 
Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN – Hepatobiliary cancers V.1.2010 – HCC5) as one of the 
possible treatments for patients with unresectable HCC and extensive liver disease who are not candidates for transplantation. [7] 
  Although sorafenib is a standard -of-care in the treatment of patients with H CC, it is 
associated with only a modest improvement in median survival as compared to best 
    
June 19, 2015   Version : 9 Page:   [ADDRESS_343054] common adverse reactions3 (≥20 percent) considered related to sorafenib were fatigue, weight loss, rash/ desquamation, hand- foot skin reaction, alopecia, diarrhea, anorexia, nausea 
and abdominal pain. [2]  Diarrhea was reported in 55 percent of sorafenib patients (grade 3 in 
10 % ). Hand -foot syndrome (21 percent overall; grade 3 in 8 %) and rash (19 %  overall; 
grade 3 in 1 %) were the most common dermatologic adverse reactions to sorafenib. 
Sorafenib dose reductions and drug holidays are often required to manage these toxicities.  
 Adhoc  subset analysis of the SHARP trial data indicated that the efficacy of sorafenib is 
reduced in an important subset of patients with advanced HCC.  [ 8] In patients with 
extrahepatic spread or macroscopic vascular invasion, the median survival was 8.9 months in patients treated with sorafenib as com pared to 6.7 months in patients treated with placebo. 
 
The long- term experience of TheraSphere in the treatment in 291 patients with HCC as part 
of a single -center, prospective, longitudinal cohort study were recently reported . [9] A total of 
526 treatments were administered (mean, 1.8; range, 1- 5). Toxicities included fatigue (57%), 
pain (23%), and nausea/vomiting (20%) ; 19% exhibited grade 3/4 bilirubin toxicity. The 30-
day mortality rate was 3%. Response rates were 42% and 57% based on WHO and EASL 
criteria, respectively. The overall TTP was 7.9 months (95% confidence interval, 6- 10.3). 
Survival times differed between patients with Child -Pugh A and B disease (A, 17.2 months; 
B, 7.7 months; P = .002). Patients with Child -Pugh B disease who had portal vein thrombosis 
(PVT) survived 5.6 months (95% confidence interval, 4.5 -6.7). Baseline age; gender; 
performance status; pr esence of portal hypertension; tumor distribution; levels of bilirubin, 
albumin, and alpha -fetoprotein; and WHO/EASL response rate predicted survival. These 
investigators concluded that patients with Child- Pugh A disease, with or without PVT, 
benefited mos t from treatment. Patients with Child -Pugh B disease who had PVT had poor 
outcomes. Therefore, TTP and overall survival varied by [CONTACT_281402].  
Results from a separate cohort of 108 consecutive patients with advanced HCC using TheraSphere  demonstrated a m edian overall survival from treatment of  16.4 months, with 
median time to progression of 10.0 months. [ 10] Tumor response at [ADDRESS_343055] in 62 patients were complete or partial response 10 (16%), stable disease 46 (74%) and progres sive disease 6 (10%). Toxicities were generally mild to moderate . The most 
common being transient fatigue during the week following administration (61%) and abdominal pain (56%).  For patients with normal bilirubin at enrollment, 32% experienced Grade 1 or  2 elevations and three patients developed Grade 3 elevations. For patients with 
elevated bilirubin at enrollment, 17% experienced Grade 2 elevations and 30% experienced Grade 3 or 4 elevations. In the majority of patients, bilirubin returned to baseline values within 4 -6 weeks. The conclu sion was that Therasphere  is safe and effective, even in patients 
with compromised liver function.  
Preliminary results of a Phase II investigation of the safety, tolerability and efficacy of 
administering TheraSphere and N exavar (sorafenib) treatment in 26 patients with HCC 
indicate that the combination is safe . [11] In this trial, all patients  began sorafenib [ADDRESS_343056] patients (65%) required 
sorafenib dosage adjustment. The most common toxicities were diarrhea, fatigue and hand foot syndrome with most being self -limiting and responsive to sorafenib dose adjustment. 
    
June 19, 2015   Version : 9 Page:   18 of 50 
 
 
One single grade 4 toxicity of worsening cirrhosis was observed. Median survival is 15.5 months which exceeds that reported in the sorafenib or placebo arms of the SHARP study (10.7 and 7.9 months respectively). The reported toxicities are consistent with the toxicity profile of both TheraSphere and sorafenib with no apparent increase in severity or frequency.    Sorafenib will be given at a dose of 400 mg, or ally, twice a day. Possible adverse events 
related to sorafenib include: cardiovascular: hypertension (9% to 17%); central nervous system: fatigue (37% to 46%), sensory neuropathy (≤13%), pain (11%); dermatologic: rash/desquamation (19% to 40%; grade 3: ≤1%), hand- foot syndrome (21% to 30%; grade 3: 
6% to 8%), alopecia (14% to 27%), pruritus (14% to 19%), dry skin (10% to 11%), erythema; endocrine & metabolic: hypoalbuminemia (≤59%), hypophosphatemia (35% to 45%; grade 3: 11% to 13%; grade 4: <1%); gastroin testinal: diarrhea (43% to 55%; grade 3: 2% to 10%; 
grade 4: <1%), lipase increased (40% to 41% [usually transient]), amylase increased (30% to 34% [usually transient]), abdominal pain (11% to 31%), weight loss (10% to 30%), anorexia (16% to 29%), nausea ( 23% to 24%), vomiting (15% to 16%), constipation (14% to 15%); 
hematologic: lymphopenia (23% to 47%; grades 3/4: ≤13%), thrombocytopenia (12% to 46%; grades 3/4: 1% to 4%), INR increased (≤42%), neutropenia (≤18%; grades 3/4: ≤5%), 
hemorrhage (15% to 18%; grade 3: 2% to 3%; grade 4: ≤2%), leukopenia; hepatic: liver 
dysfunction (≤11%; grade 3: 2%; grade 4: 1%); neuromuscular & skeletal: muscle pain, weakness, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696]: dyspnea (≤14%), and cough (≤13%).  
The early reports of serious adverse events possibly associated with the use of TheraSphere 
included death, hepatorenal failure, liver abscess, hepatic encephalopathy, hepatic decompensation, radiation hepatitis, radiation pneumonitis, duodenal ulcer, gastrointestinal bleeding and cholecystitis. As clinical experience with TheraSphere increased, the pre -
treatment high risk factors associated with these early serious events were identified, leading 
to improved patient selection criteria and thereby [CONTACT_281403]. These ri sk factors include infiltrative tumor type, bulk disease (tumor volume >70% or 
nodules too numerous to count), AST or ALT > five times the upper limit of normal, bilirubin > 2 mg/dL, tumor volume >50% in the presence of an albumin < 3 g/dL and those in whom extra -hepatic shunting to the lungs or gastrointestinal tract cannot be managed through 
standard angiographic techniques.  
For those patients without the pre -treatment high risk factors noted above, TheraSphere is 
very well tolerated, with treatment in th e US commonly administered in an outpatient setting.

4. Study design 
This is a single -arm phase II clinical trial to evaluate the safety  of continuous sorafenib at 400 
mg twice daily followed, after 4 (+/ - 1 week) weeks from starting sorafenib, by [CONTACT_281405]- 90 
treatment concomitant with sorafenib, in patients with child -Pugh A, BCLC -stage C HCC.  Of 
note, the time between starting sorafenib  and Yttrium -90 administration will be 4 weeks 
regardless whether the patient underwent dose reductions or interruptions. Patients will continue taking the maximum tolerating dose of sorafenib , with no interruption during and 
after the Yttrium -90 procedures. This is a single -institution study that  will be  conducted at 
MDACC, Department of GI Medical Oncology and Department of Interventional Radiology. 
No sorafenib interruptions around the procedure will be applied, and only one Y -90 treatment 
only will be performed.

• Subject withdraws consent from study treatment and study procedures.  A subject must be removed from the trial at his/her own request or at the request of his/her legally acceptable representative.  At any time during the trial and without giving reasons, a subject may decline to participate further.  The subject will not suffer any disadvantage as a result.  
• Subject is lost to follow -up. 
• Death.  
 
Subjects  may be  withdrawn from the study for the following reasons:  
• The subject is non- compliant with study drug, trial procedures, or both; including the 
use of anti -cancer therapy not prescribed by [CONTACT_4690]. 
• Pregnancy.  Pregnancy will be reported as an SAE.  (Note: subjects who have been 
withdrawn from treatment with study drug because of pregnancy should not undergo CT scans [with contrast]/MRI or bone scans while pregnant.)

[IP_ADDRESS] Treatment -emergent hypertension  
Hypertension is a known and potentially serious AE associated with sorafenib treatment. Subjects will check blood pressure at home , on a weekly basis through the first [ADDRESS_343071] be reported by [CONTACT_1963] ..  Blood pressure measurements considered out of the normal range are 
diastolic pressure > 90 mm Hg and/or systolic pressure > 140 mm Hg, or a  20 mm Hg increase in diastolic pressure if the previous measurement was within normal limits.  
The dose -modification schedule to be followed in the event of treatment -emergent 
hypertension is outlined below .  The choice of anti -hypertensive medication to be used in 
cases of treatment- emergent hypertension will be at the investigator's discretion and based on 
site-specific treatment guidelines as applicable.  All anti -hypertensive medications used for

6.3 TheraSphere  
 
 
TheraSphere treatment is performed in the outpatient setting. Prior to initial treatment, a 
Technetium -99 Macroaggregated Albumin (Tc-99m MAA) scan will be performed using 
standard institutional practices.  If there is an uncorrectable risk of flow to the gastrointestinal 
organs or risk of excessive shunting to the lungs, TheraSphere treatment will not be 
administered and the patien t will receive alternative or no treatment as previously defined in 
the treatment plan  
 Following treatment, patients will remain at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_281385] (usually 2-6 hours). All 
patients will be evaluated post -treatment to assess clinical experience and adverse 
experiences.  
 
 
    
June 19, 2015   Version : 9 Page:   [ADDRESS_343073] 1 -2 outpatient visits for pre -treatment evaluation to determine initial 
eligibility to receive TheraSphere, followed by a treatment visit for outpatient delivery of 
TheraSphere, . 
 
Catheters will be placed in the hepatic artery in the angiography suites.  No scheduled 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_281386], unless the physician determines that the patient should be 
admitted following treatment for management of a complication or adverse experience.  
 
Pre-Therasphere Evaluation  
 
Pre-treatment evaluation will include the initial screening by [CONTACT_969], physical examination, 
laboratory and diagnostic studies  (hepatic angio graphy and Tc -MAA Scan).  A treatment plan 
will be developed, dosage will be calculated, and the initial TheraSphere activity vial will be 
ordered from the manufacturer (Nordion).  
  
 
Diagnostic Imaging Studies  
 
Contrast enhanced Computed Tomography Scanning of the Abdomen/Liver or  Magnetic 
Resonance Imaging of the Abdomen/Liver  
 
Technetium -99 Macroaggregated Albumin (Tc -99m MAA) Scan.  
 
CT or MR scanning of the liver will be performed and the images used to calculate the appropriate liver volume for TheraSphere dose determination.  Reasonable 
attempts will be made to use the same imaging modality as that used for pre-treatment for all subsequent evaluations of the patient related to dose determination.  
 
The dose is calculated as described below (Section 7.3. 3.4), using the appropriate 
reference liver volume and mass.  Dosimetric techniques for TheraSphere are 
discussed in detail in the peer -reviewed literature.
  
 
The imaging scan is used to document the location and size of  the hepatic lesion(s) 
and vascular anatomy where possible.  
 
Prior to first TheraSphere treatment a Tc -99m MAA scan will be performed to 
obtain a preliminary assessment of hepatic infusion and any potential 
extrahepatic shunting or gastrointestinal flow.  Lung Shunt Fraction will be determined as the ratio of total lung counts divided by [CONTACT_281410].  
 
If gastrointestinal flow is detected, steps will be undertaken (embolization, change in catheter position) to correct this flow, prior to T heraSphere 
administration.  If gastrointestinal flow cannot be corrected using established angiographic techniques, the patient may not receive TheraSphere treatment. 
    
June 19, 2015   Version : 9 Page:   [ADDRESS_343074] be < 30 Gy (< 16.5mCi of injected activity) per treatment. Any 
uncorrected detectable gastrointestinal flow is a contraindication to TheraSphere 
treatment.  
 
Treatment Planning  
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_281387], indicating the number and sequence of planned TheraSphere 
treatments. The clinician will assure that the patient understands the two -stage 
screening process that is necessary for this treatment procedure.  The physician and patient will discuss and agree on a contingency treatment plan, including the option of no treatment, in the event that the pa tient is found ineligible to receive TheraSphere 
after catheter placement. The Treatment Plan may be modified following initial treatment, based on clinical experience and patient response to treatment.   
 
 
 TheraSphere Dose Calculation  
The target dose of TheraSphere used is 80 – [ADDRESS_343075] 
order relative to the TheraSphere production schedule, and the treatment date proposed for the 
patient, it may be necessary to allow T heraSphere to physically decay  to the appropriate 
targeted activity before injection.  
 
The amount of radioactivity required to deliver the dose to the selected liver target is 
calculated using the following formula:  
 
Activity Required (GBq) = [Desired Dose (Gy)][ Mass of Selected Liver Target (kg)]  
                50   
 
In nearly all cases more than 95% of the glass microspheres are delivered. Calculation of the liver dose (Gy) delivered after injection uses the following formula:  
 
Dose (Gy) =     50 [Injected Activity (GBq)][1-F][1 -R] 
  Mass of Selected Liver Target (kg)  
 
Where F is the fraction of injected activity deposited into the lungs as measured by [CONTACT_21851] -99m 
MAA and R is the calculated residual.  
 
 
TheraSphere Ordering  
The TheraSphere order will be placed by [CONTACT_281411] U ser or designated colleague. Upon 
completion of the pre -treatment screening evaluation, treatment plan and dose calculation, a 
TheraSphere order form will be sent to TheraSphere Customer Support, either by E -mail to 
TheraSphereCustomerSuppor [EMAIL_5489]  or by [CONTACT_12100] 1 -[PHONE_5837]).   The deadline for 
order is the Tuesday prior  to calibration date  to permit  inclusion of  your order in the weekly 
dispensing cycle.   
    
June 19, 2015   Version : 9 Page:   32 of 50 
 
 
 
TheraSphere is viable for therapeutic use for up to 12 days after the calibration date.  
TheraSphere will be shipped by [CONTACT_281412]-site by [CONTACT_281413].  To meet the desired absorbed dose to the patient’s liver, the 
clinician must schedule the patient’s TheraSphere treatment visit to occur within 12 days of the calibration date, and take into consideration the appropriate physical decay of the dose 
activity.  
 
6.4 Procedures on Day of Treatment 
 
Treatment with TheraSphere may be performed in the outpatient setting.  The 
following sections describe the procedures performed on day of treatment.  
 
Catheter Placement and TheraSphere Infusion  
 
The goals of percutaneous catheter placement for TheraSphere administration are: first, to 
limit the perfusion to the normal liver, and, second, to deliver TheraSphere as specified in the 
treatment plan.  
  
On the day of treatment,  TheraSphere is administered via infusion under imaging 
guidance  through an hepatic arterial catheter appropriately positioned in the arterial 
anatomy to permit selective infusion of TheraSphere into the target tissue selected for 
treatment.   The interventional radiologist will pe rform this procedure.  The patency of the 
catheter will be maintained using standard techniques. Administration of TheraSphere  
Regardless of catheter size or infusion pressure used, the flow of the microspheres will mimic the flow dynamics of the vessel being infused. 
 
The TheraSphere administration procedure is described in the TheraSphere package insert  and in peer -reviewed literature.
Patient Management  
Following treatment, the patient will remain under observation consistent with standard care 
guidelines  for aftercare procedures involving arterial catheterization.  The patient will be sent 
home when the physician determines that the patient is stable and that there is no risk of bleeding from the access site.  At the time of discharge, patients will be in structed per 
institutional guidelines regarding after -care including instructions if they develop a problem.  
 
Because there may be small unrecognized arterial vessels connecting to the gastrointestinal 
system, prophylactic anti -ulcer medication is recommended at discharge. Gastric coating 
agents and tapering 5 day steroid dose pack (to reduce fatigue unless contraindicated) may 
also be given.  
 
Special radiation isolation procedures are not necessary following TheraSphere 
treatment.  
 
 
 
    
June 19, 2015   Version : 9 Page:   [ADDRESS_343076]- Treatment Period  
 
If a patient receives a liver transplant or dies in the immediate period following treatment with 
TheraSphere, radiation safety guidelines for handling of the body and/or body tissues should 
be followed, as dictated by [CONTACT_281414].  
 
There are no federal regulations that clearly address the radiation safety issues related to 
handling of liver tissue following TheraSphere treatment.  The surgeon and oncologist will consider the risks and benefits of the clinical circumstances and relevant institutional 
policy, before determining whether, and when, it is safe to proceed with procedures that require direct handling of TheraSphere -treated liver tissue in the immediate post -
treatment period.  
Most patients have surface dose rates <20µSv/h at 30 days following treatment. Generally a patient skin surface dose rate of < 20µSv/h does not require special handling (such as lead gloves, special instruments and extremity radiation monitors) by [CONTACT_281415]. Notify radiation safety personnel for transportation and storage of the explanted tissue. 
Very small amounts of longer -acting radioactive by -products have been noted. These by-
products are well within known toxicity levels but may present some post -mortem tissue 
handling issues. Some regulatory jurisdictions are developi[INVESTIGATOR_281388]-products  post mortem, specifically in regards to cremation ; relevant institutional 
policy should be considered.  
 
Travel docum entation may be offered to patients who need to cross international borders, as 
the long lived activity may be detectable with the sensitive equipment at some facilities.  
 
6.6 Device Dosages  
 
The target dose of TheraSphere used is  80 – [ADDRESS_343077] radiation safety techniques 
should be used.  
 
Glass microspheres are typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 20 -30 micrometers ( µm) in diameter, or about [ADDRESS_343078] treatment angiographic 
observations, macroscopic embolization of the hepatic arteries was not observed indicating 
hepatic perfusion is maintained.

Safety variables include the following: AEs, laboratory changes (complete blood counts, electrolytes, chemistry, and coagulation), changes in vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and temperature) and ECG at the investigator’s discretion .  
All AEs whether considered drug -related or not, will be reported in  with a diagnosis, 
start/stop dates, action taken, whether treatment was discontinued, any corrective measures 
    
June 19, 2015   Version : 9 Page:   [ADDRESS_343083] to toxicity grade. 
7.4.1 Adverse events  
Investigators should refer to the Safety Information section of the current IB for sorafenib, 
including the DCSI (development core safety information), for the expected side effects of sorafenib.  As with any agent, there is always the potential for unexpected AEs, including hypersensitivity reactions.  The IB will be updated if any new relevant safety data are obtained.  
Therapeutic monitoring should be performed following dose selection or m odification of 
sorafenib  in a manner consistent with the local clinical standard of care.  In general, subjects 
should be closely monitored for side effects of all concomitant medications regardless of the path of drug elimination.  
All concomitant medications must be recorded in the  subject’s source documentation.  
Subjects must be carefully monitored for AEs.  This monitoring also includes significant changes to clinical laboratory test results.  Adverse events should be assessed in ter ms of their 
seriousness, intensity, and relationship to the study drug, or other chemotherapy/treatment.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Definitions  
Definition of adverse event (AE)  
In a clinical study, an AE is any untoward medical occurrence ( i.e. any unfavorable and 
unintended sign [i ncluding abnormal laboratory findings], symptom or disease) in a 
patient or clinical investigation subject after providing written informed consent for participation in the study.  Therefore, an AE may or may not be temporally or causally associated with t he use of a medicinal (investigational) product.  
A surgical procedure that was planned prior to the start of the study by [CONTACT_39708] (however, the condition for which the surgery is required may be an AE  if the condition worsens compared to baseline ). 
The clinical manifestation of any failure of expected pharmacological action (lack of efficacy) is not recorded as an AE if it is already reflected as a data point captured in the CRF.  If, however, the even t fulfills any of the criteria of an SAE, it must be recorded as and AE and 
reported as an SAE . 
 
• Conditions  that started before signing of informed consent and for which no symptoms 
or treatment are present until signing of informed consent  are recorded as medical 
history ( e.g. seasonal allergy without acute complaints).  
    
June 19, 2015   Version : 9 Page:   38 of 50 
 
 
• Conditions  that started before signing of informed consent and for which symptoms or 
treatment are present after signing of informed consent, at unchanged intensity , are 
recorded as medical history  (e.g. allergic pollinosis).  
• Conditions  that started or deteriorated after signing of informed consent will be 
documented as adverse events . 
Definition of serious adverse event (SAE)  
An SAE  is classified as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, meets any of the 
following criteria (a  – f): 
a. Results in death . 
b. Is life -threa tening.  
The term ‘life -threatening’ in the definition refers to an event in which the patient 
was at risk of death at the time of the event, it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  
c. Requires inpatient ho spi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] . 
A hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23565]:  
- The admission results in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8932] 12  hour s. 
- The admission is pre -planned.  
(i.e. elective or scheduled surgery arranged prior to the start of the study)  
- The admissi on is not associated with an AE. 
(e.g. social hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8933]).  
However, it should be noted that invasive treatment during any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_39675] ‘medically important’ and as such may be reportable as an SAE dependent on clinical judgment.  In addition, where local regulatory authorities specifically require a more stringent definition, the local regulation takes precedence.  
d. Results in persistent or significant disability / incapacity . 
Disability  means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life’s 
functions. 
e. Is a congenital anomaly / birth defect . 
f. Is another  medically important serious event as judged by [CONTACT_093] . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Classifications for adverse event assessment  
The following classifications should  be used:  
• Seriousness  
 
• Intensity  
As an alternative to the grading system described in the standard tex t below 
    
June 19, 2015   Version : 9 Page:   39 of 50 
 
 
(mild, moderate, severe), other systems for intensity may be used (e.g. CTCAE, Grade 1 to Grade 5).  If used, this needs to be stated and definitions of the grades should be provided.  If applicable, a “translation” between the CTCAE system and the standard system of intensity grading may have to be provided.  
 
• Causal relationships to study drug:  
 To be assessed separately for concomitant agents 
 
  
  
 
• Study treatment action  
 
• Other specific treatment of AE  
 
• Causal relationship to protocol -required procedures(s)  
 
• Outcome  
 
All AEs will be assessed and documented by [CONTACT_39709]. 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_343084] be determined according to the criteria given in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]. 
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Intensity  
The intensity of the AE is classified according to the CTCAEv4.0.  Grade refers to the severity (intensity) of the AE: 
CTCAEv4 Grade 1 : mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic 
observations only; intervention is not indicated.  
CTCAEv4 Grade 2 : moderate; minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention is indicated; 
limiting to age -appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL; instrumental 
ADL refers to preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the telephone, managing money, etc) . 
CTCAEv4 Grade 3 : Severe or medically significant but not immediately life threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_281391]; disabling; limiting to 
self care ADL (self care ADL refers to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden).  
CTCAEv4 Grade 4 : life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention is indicated.  
CTCAEv4 Grade 5 : death due to an AE.  
    
June 19, 2015   Version : 9 Page:   40 of 50 
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS].3 Causal relationship  
The assessment of the causal relationship between an AE and the administration of treatment is a clinical decision based on all available information . 
The causality assessment should be done separately for each study treatment . 
The assessment is based on the question whether there was a “reasonable causal relationship” to the study treatment in question.  
Possible answers are “yes” or “no”.  
An assessment of “no” would include:  
1. The existence of a clear alternative explanation, e.g.  mechanical bleeding at surgical 
site. 
or 
2. Non-plausibility, e.g. the subject is struck by [CONTACT_23634]; cancer developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a few days after the first drug administration.  
An assessment of “yes” indicates that there is a reaso nable suspi[INVESTIGATOR_267374].  
Factors to be considered in assessing the relationship of the AE to study treatment include:  
- The temporal sequence from drug administration:  The event should occur after the dr ug 
is given.  The length of time from drug exposure to event should be evaluated in the clinical context of the event.  
- Recovery on drug discontinuation (de -challenge), recurrence on drug re -introduction (re -
challenge):  
- Subject’s response after de- challenge  or subjects response after re -challenge should be 
considered in the view of the usual clinical course of the event in question. 
- Underlying, concomitant, intercurrent diseases:   
Each event should be evaluated in the context of the natural history and cour se of the 
disease being treated and any other disease the subject may have.  
- Concomitant medication or treatment:  The other drugs the subject is taking or the treatment the subject receives should be examined to determine whether any of them may be suspect ed to cause the event in 
question.  
 [Causal relationship to protocol -required procedure(s)]  
The assessment of a possible causal relationship between the AE and protocol -required 
procedure(s) is based on the question whether there was  a “reasonable causal r elationship” to 
protocol -required procedure(s).  
Possible answers are “yes” or “no”.

[IP_ADDRESS] Assessments and documentation of adverse events  
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting  of serious adverse events 
The definition of serious adverse events (SAEs) is given in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]. 
Each serious adverse event must be followed up until r esolution or stabilization, by 
[CONTACT_39718]. An isolated laboratory abnormality 
that is assigned grade 4, according to CTC definition, is not reportable as an SAE;  unless the 
investigator assesses that the event meets standard ICH criteria for an SAE.  CTC grade 4 baseline laboratory abnormalities that are part of the disease profile should not be reported as 
    
June 19, 2015   Version : 9 Page:   42 of 50 
 
 
an SAE, specifically when they are allowed or not excluded by [CONTACT_39719]/exclusion criteria.    When required, and according to local law and regulations, serious adverse events must be reported to the Ethics Committee and Regulatory Authorities.   
 All serious adverse events should be reported to Bayer  within [ADDRESS_343085] for 
reporting procedures.  
 The Investigator may report serious adverse drug reactions (SADRs) using either:  
 
An ADEERS form (Adverse Event Expedited Reporting System) available  at

June 19, 2015   Version : 9 Page:   [ADDRESS_343087]’s participation in this study.  The report should be submitted within the same timelines as an SAE, althoug h a pregnancy per se is not considered an SAE.   
For a study subject, the outcome of the pregnancy should be followed up carefully, and any abnormal outcome of the mother or the child should be reported. 
For the pregnancy of a study subject’s partner, all efforts should be made to obtain similar 
information on course and outcome, subject to the partner’s consent.  
For all reports, the forms provided are to be used.  
Progressive disease  
If progressive disease leads to signs and symptoms tha t meet the criteria for an SAE 
(i.e., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], disability, death, or important medical event), the signs and symptoms 
should be reported as an SAE and not the underlying progressive disease.  
Death  
If any subject dies during the trial or within [ADDRESS_343088] the cause of death in detail (using the SAE Form) 
within 24 hours.  
7.5 Other procedures and variables  
7.6 Appropriateness of procedures / measurements 
The assessments described in the previous sections are widely used and generally recognized 
as reliable, accurate, and relevant for determining the safety and efficacy of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_51673].  
8. Statistical methods and determination of sample size  
8.1 Statistical and analytical plans  
Statistical consideration for 2012 -0870: study of sorafenib plus theraspheres for extrahepatic 
hepatocellular carcinoma (redesign, [ADDRESS_343089] enrolled in study 2012- 0870)  
 This is a phase II study of sorafenib plus theraspheres for extrahepatic hepat ocellular 
carcinoma (EHC). The primary objective is to evaluate the progression -free survival (PFS), 
where the progression -free survival will be measured from the start of therapy until failure to 
disease progression or death.  
 Historical data showed that  the median PFS was 4.[ADDRESS_343090] that the combination treatment would improve the PFS.   A maximum of 40 will be recruited for the study at a rate of 1 -2 patients per month. The study 
will monitor toxicity and futility.    
 Futility monitoring  
    
June 19, 2015   Version : 9 Page:   44 of 50 
 
 
The primary endpoint PFS will be monitored using the method of Thall et al. (2005), and we 
will stop enrolling patients to the study if, based on the available data, we have little reason to 
believe that the media n PFS of the combination therapy ( mE) is more than that of sorafenib 
alone ( mS) in the historical data, which was 4.1 months. Formally, we’ll stop the study early 
if  
 Prob(m
E > m S |data) < 0.15    
 
That is, if there is less than 15% chance the median PFS of the combination therapy is more 
than that of sorafenib, the trial will be stopped. Where mS represents the median PFS for  
sorafenib alone in the historical data with an inverse gamma distribution  IG(11, 41), which 
corresponds to a mean of 4.1 months a nd a variance of 1.87. m E  represents the median PFS 
for the study combination therapy, assuming the prior for mE is  IG (2.17,4.8), which has the 
same mean as mS but with a much larger variance (i.e. 99) to reflect much greater uncertainty 
about the median PFS of the combination therapy of sorafenib and theraspheres.  
  
Futility monitoring will start once [ADDRESS_343091] been enrolled. Assuming an accrual rate 
of 1.5 per month and an additional follow -up of 12 months, the operating characteristics for 
the futility stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_281392] 8 ,

If the trial continues to maximum accrual of 40 patients and maintains sufficient follow -up to 
observe 25 events (PD/death) with a median PFS of 4.1 months, then a 95% credible interval for median PFS would extend from 2.76 to 6.08 months.  
 Toxicity Monitoring  
In addition, toxicity will be monitored closely in all patients using the method of Thall et al (1995). The interim monitoring will be first conducted after th e first [ADDRESS_343092] been 
evaluated and then be repeated after each cohort of 5 patients. Denote the probability of 
toxicity by θ
E, where toxicity is defined as any non- hematological Grade 3 or greater 
complications attributable to the treatment.  We assume θ E ~ beta (0.6, 1.4).  We will stop the 
    
June 19, 2015   Version : 9 Page:   45 of 50 
 
 
trial if at any point Pr(θ E > 0.30 | data)  >0.85. That is, we will stop the trial if, a t any time 
during the study, we determine that there is more than 85% chance that the toxicity rate is more than 30%. Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_281393] 9.

Futility monitoring in CTC website  
 The Department of Biostatistics will provide and maintain a website (“Clinical Trial Conduct”:  https://biostatistics.mdanderson.org/ClinicalTrialConduct/
) for futility monitoring 
for each treatment arm on this study. The Clinical Trial Conduct website resides on a secure server, and access is gained through usernames and passwords provided to personnel responsible for enrolling patients and updating patient data.   The website is accessed through 
a browser using secure socket layer (SSL) technology. Personnel responsible for enrolling patients on trials, which  includes the principal investigator(s), research nurse(s), and data 
coordinator(s), will be trained by [CONTACT_281416]; the importance of timely updating of follow -up times and recording of events  
will be emphasized in training.  
 
Analysis Plan:  
Primary analysis  
Once the trial is completed, the posterior median time to progression and it 95% credible 
interval will be estimated. In addition, posterior probability that the median PFS is more than 
    
June 19, 2015   Version : 9 Page:   46 of 50 
 
 
sorafenib will be assessed. Furthermore, Kaplan -Meier method will be used to estimate 
median PFS and the 95% confidence interval. Log rank test, univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models will be used to identify prognostic factors for PFS.  
 Secondary analysis  
 Toxicity rate and mortality rate will be estimated with a 90% credib le interval. the posterior 
probability that the toxicity rate is greater 30% will be evaluated as well.  
Binary endpoints such as response will be tabulated by [CONTACT_281417] 95% confidence interval (CI). Fisher’s exact test will be applied  to compare the patient 
characteristics between responders and non -responders. Univariate and multivariate logistic 
regression models will be fit to identify clinical factors associated with overall response.  
The time -to-event endpoints will be analyzed us ing Kaplan- Meier method, Log rank test and 
Cox proportional hazards regression modeling. Discrete or categorical patient -reported 
outcomes and quality of life assessments will be tabulated by [CONTACT_151660] 95% CI, while for the continuous data, summary sta tistics including n, mean, and standard deviation, 
median, minimum and maximum will be computed.

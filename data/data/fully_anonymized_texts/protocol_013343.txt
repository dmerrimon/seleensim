Number of Subjects [ADDRESS_984170]-treatment. 1) Positive depression screen (PHQ-9 score > 8) or current antidepressant treatment 2) Report <150 minutes of weekly moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) on the GPAQ 3) Physically able to engage in physical activity 4) Written and verbal fluency in English. Statistical Methodology A total of [ADDRESS_984171] cancer survivors range from 7-13%[ADDRESS_984172] cancer survivors (e.g., BRCA1/2 mutation carriers) may also have increased risks for other cancers.[ADDRESS_984173] cancer survivors and an important factor associated with poor prognosis. Individual studies estimate the prevalence of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) in breast cancer survivors to range from 10-30%.[ADDRESS_984174] cancer survivors are estimated to be as high as 50%.5,[ADDRESS_984175] cancer survivors. A recent meta-analysis integrated 76 prospective studies, including those in which depression was assessed prior to cancer diagnosis and those that assessed depression after diagnosis. Results indicated an 18% increase in mortality for breast cancer patients with depression.[ADDRESS_984176] cancer mortality (ranging from 39% to 51%) among physically active breast cancer survivors. These studies also find physical activity associated with a reduced risk of all-cause mortality, ranging from 27% to 56%.  Physical Activity and Depression. Numerous trials, including our own work described in Section (3.3.2), have assessed the efficacy of aerobic exercise as a treatment for depression. Meta-analyses summarizing these studies have reported effect sizes ranging from 0.[ADDRESS_984177] size (Cohen’s d) of 0.22, suggesting a small-to-moderate effect of exercise on depressive symptoms in cancer survivors.    
Increasing Physical Activity among Breast Cancer Survivors with Depression      December 29, [ADDRESS_984178] will support future grant applications. These future studies will utilize multi-phase optimization strategy (MOST) to identify the optimal combination of intervention strategies to increase physical activity among breast cancer survivors. Aim 1. Evaluate the feasibility of screening and subject recruitment through targeted mailings to breast cancer survivors using the UT Southwestern cancer registries.  Aim 1A. Assess the percentage of contact[CONTACT_720611].  Aim 1B. Assess the percentage of respondents meeting eligibility criteria (< 150 minutes of physical activity per week and > 8 on the PHQ-9). Aim 1C. Assess the percentage of eligible respondents enrolled in the physical activity intervention. Aim 2. Evaluate the feasibility of implementing a multi-component physical activity intervention in breast cancer survivors with significant depressive symptoms. Aim 2A. Physical activity program compliance.  Aim 2A.a. Assess the percentage of physical activity classes attended  Aim 2A.b. Assess the percentage of days of use of the self-monitoring device Aim 2B. Participant-reported program satisfaction Aim 3. Conduct preliminary analysis of changes in physical activity and depressive symptoms following the physical activity intervention. Hypothesis 1. Participants in the physical activity program will demonstrate increases in physical activity at three and six months Hypothesis 2. Participants in the active living program will demonstrate decreases in depressive symptoms at three and six months post-baseline. Cancer Relevance: This project simultaneously targets two factors (depression and inactivity) related to poor outcomes in breast cancer survivors and provide important information on how to effectively address these risk factors in a real-world setting.

Based on indications of physical activity frequency from the screening questionnaire, we will invite those who meet eligibility criteria (estimated to be at least 33% of respondents [n=50], based on national prevalence of sedentary behavior and depression among breast cancer survivors) to attend an initial in-person screening and baseline assessment session. 
Increasing Physical Activity among Breast Cancer Survivors with Depression      December 29, [ADDRESS_984182] to be assessed for safety of engaging in physical activity, following recommendations identified in the ACSM guidelines.18 The Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PAR-Q)[ADDRESS_984183] their physician to ensure their safety engaging in physical activity.  Study assessments (described in section 6.0) will be conducted at the baseline assessment visit. Participants will complete the PAR-Q to identify potential medical contraindications. Participants indicating potential contraindications to exercise will be instructed to discuss participation with their physician before engaging in physical activity.  Blood samples will be collected at the baseline assessment visit. 5.[ADDRESS_984184] clinician-rated assessments (all assessments which are not self-report). During the trial, the outcome assessments will be obtained at Weeks 1, 13, and 25. Participants will be asked to wear an accelerometer during Weeks 1, 13 and 25. If the participant is not able to come to the site and (s)he agrees, some assessments and/or visits may be conducted by [CONTACT_648], by [CONTACT_2319], or at appropriate off-site locations, and/or on participants’ or other off-site computers via the secure study website(s) if access to a computer with internet service is available. Detailed descriptions of the assessments are provided in section 6.0. 5.5 Participant Discontinuation In order to ensure safety, female participants who become pregnant during the study will be required to discontinue participation in the intervention. Participants may be asked to stop study intervention if any situation arises that, in the investigator’s judgment, poses a safety risk. 
Increasing Physical Activity among Breast Cancer Survivors with Depression      December 29, [ADDRESS_984185] stop the study intervention will still be asked to complete assessment visits as scheduled.  5.6 Participant Remuneration Participants will receive monetary remuneration for their participation in the trial to compensate for their time, travel arrangements, and the burden of participation. Essential to the study is appropriate support for participants’ time and effort contributing to the study. Reimbursement for attending data collection visits will be made based on the following schedule: • Reimbursements will be made for participants who complete the initial survey. • Reimbursements will also be made for the assessment visits (Baseline and Weeks 13 and 25). 25 participants who complete the eligibility screening assessments (described in section 6.2.1) will be chosen randomly to receive a $[ADDRESS_984186].

Prior and Concomitant Medications. The Prior and Concomitant Medications form assesses prescribed medications taken by [CONTACT_2299]. The Prior and Concomitant Medications form will be administered at the screening visit and then monthly thereafter, if the participant endorses a change in medication status. Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire-Revised (PAR-Q). The PAR-Q19 asks 7 health-related questions to determine whether a person needs to consult with their physician prior to engaging in an exercise program. The PAR-Q will be administered at the screening visit.  6.2.3 Study Assessments Measurements of Physical Activity: Actigraph GT3X+ accelerometer. – The Actigraph will provide a valid and reliable objective assessment of physical activity.24 Subjects will be asked to wear the device for a 7-day period at each assessment time point (baseline and weeks 13 and 25). Subjects will be instructed to wear the device on their non-dominant arm and to remove the device only when it may become submerged in water (bathing, swimming, etc.). Following, the 7-day period, subjects will return the accelerometers using a postage-paid envelope. Measurement of Psychosocial and Physical Outcomes: Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology – Self-Rated (QIDS-SR16). The QIDS-SR16 25-27 is a 16-item questionnaire to assess severity of depression-specific symptoms. The QIDS-SR16 has high reliability (Cronbach’s alpha of 0.83), good concurrent validity (correlations between the QIDS-SR16 and the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression is 0.81)25.  Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36). The SF-3628 is a 36-item survey of patient-reported general health and quality of life across eight domains of well-being (physical functioning, social functioning, vitality, pain, general health, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, and mental health). Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2272] (PSQI). The PSQI29 is a 19-item scale designed to assess sleep quality and disturbances. Scores range from 0 to 21 with higher scores representing worse sleep quality. The PSQI has demonstrated reliability (Cronbach’s alpha of 0.80) in the assessment of self-reported sleep quality and validity when compared to sleep diaries and polysomnography.30  Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI). The BFI31 is a 9-item scale designed to assess fatigue. The BFI demonstrates good reliability (Cronbach’s alpha of 0.96) and validity (correlation of 0.86 with the POMS fatigue subscale).  Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy – Breast (FACT-B) – The FACT-B32 is a 44-item scale designed to measure multidimensional quality of life in breast cancer patients. The FACT-B has demonstrated reliability (Cronbach’s alpha of 0.90) and concurrent validity (0.87 correlation with the Functional Living Index-Cancer and 0.86 correlation with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General). Brief COPE. The Brief Cope33 is a 28-item scale designed to assess a wide range of copi[INVESTIGATOR_25133]. The Brief COPE has been used in studies of cancer patients and demonstrates good reliability and validity.

 9  Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS). The SHAPS34 is a 14-item scale that measures anhedonia, the inability to experience pleasure. The SHAPS has adequate construct validity, satisfactory test-retest reliability (ICC=0.70) and high internal consistency has also been reported (Cronbach’s alpha of 0.94).  State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). The STAI35 is a 40-item scale that measures state and trait anxiety.  Anthropomorphic assessments. Height will be assessed at baseline. Weight and waist circumference will be measured at each assessment time point. Height and weight measurements will be used to calculate Body Mass Index (BMI).  Metabolic indices. Blood samples will be collected by a trained phlebotomist to allow for evaluation of markers of metabolic health, including blood glucose, triglycerides, and lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805]. Antidepressant Medication Use. The [LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_143465] (MGH-ATRQ) will be assess the current use antidepressant medication. Relationship Status. A single-item question will ask participants to indicate their current relationship status from one of 7 categories (single, never married; cohabiting with partner; married, living together; married, not living together; separated; divorced; widowed). The Couples Satisfaction Index (CSI)[ADDRESS_984189] a self-report questionnaire aimed at evaluation participants’ satisfaction with the program. This questionnaire will include Likert-scale questions about: 1) satisfaction with the program; 2) program engagement/adherence; 3) program enjoyment; 4) perception of program effectiveness; 5) willingness to recommend program to others; 6) barriers to program participation; 7) intent to maintain physical activity; and 8) attitudes toward physical activity. This assessment will allow for further refinement of the intervention to ensure its sustainability and broad dissemination. Psychological Mediators/Moderators of Physical Activity Behavior Change: Physical Activity Stages of Change Questionnaire. The 4-item scale assesses the current stage within the Transtheoretical Model framework (Pre-contemplation, Contemplation, Preparation, Action, Maintenance). These stages are highly correlated with change in physical activity over time.37 Physical Activity Self-Efficacy Questionnaire. The 3-item scale assesses self-efficacy for physical activity. Activity-specific self-efficacy is highly correlated with activity change and psychosocial outcomes.37 6.2.4 Physiological Measures Physiological Measures. Physiological measures include height, weight, body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference.  Height will be obtained once at baseline and the other measures will be obtained at each assessment visit.  6.2.5 Safety Assessments Assessments involved in determining participants’ ability to safely participate in the protocol (maximal exercise testing, laboratory tests, and physical exam) are described under Diagnostic

The facility will be staffed by [CONTACT_720615] [CONTACT_97829].  7.2 Staff Training The study staff will be trained and certified as specified in the Manual of Procedures and Study Tools Manual. Training will cover protocol-specific training as needed (e.g., assessments, study interventions, fidelity to the protocol and safety procedures, data management and collection, research procedures including understanding reliability and validity, and problem solving), as well as any IRB-required trainings  
Increasing Physical Activity among Breast Cancer Survivors with Depression     December 29, [ADDRESS_984194] cancer survivors. The feasibility of the study will be assessed by [CONTACT_4868]: 1) Screening - the number of subjects screened through the web-based questionnaire and the percentage of those screened who meet program eligibility requirements  2) Recruitment - the percentage of screened subjects that are ultimately enrolled 3) Intervention Compliance – defined as percentage of weekly exercise does completed by [CONTACT_720616] 4) Retention – defined as percentage of assessments completed  Consistent with Aim 3, we will conduct a data analysis examining the effects of the intervention on physical activity and depressive symptoms. A mixed-effects repeated measures model will be used to analyze the primary outcome measures (minutes of MVPA and QIDS-C scores). The independent variables in the model will be time (weeks 1, 13, and 25)(within-subjects factor). The model will allow for random slopes and intercepts while all other factors will be fixed effects. The baseline value of the dependent variable will be included as a covariate as will the other potential covariates if needed [age, race, gender, history of depression]. The need for higher order times terms or the transformation log (time+1) to obtain a better fitting model will be considered. The goodness of fit of the final model will be investigated. The analysis will use all available data from all randomized patients with at least one post-baseline visit (i.e., modified “intent to treat” sample) and all tests will be two-sided with alpha of .[ADDRESS_984195] Cancer Survivors with Depression     December 29, 2015

The study team must obtain written approval of the study protocol, consent form, other supporting documents, and any advertising for participant recruitment from the UT Southwestern institutional review board (IRB) in order to participate in the study. Prior to study initiation, the protocol and the informed consent documents will be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_9904] (ERC) or IRB. Any amendments to the protocol or consent materials must be approved before they are implemented. Annual progress reports and Serious Adverse Event (SAE) reports will be submitted to each IRB, according to its usual procedures. 9.2 Regulatory Files The regulatory files should contain all required regulatory documents, study-specific documents, and all important communications. Regulatory files will be reviewed at each participating site for regulatory document compliance prior to study initiation, throughout the study, as well as at the study closure. 9.3 Informed Consent The informed consent form is a means of providing information regarding the trial to a prospective participant and allows for an informed decision about participation in the study. The informed consent will be approved by [CONTACT_11577](s). Every study participant is required to sign a valid, IRB-approved current version of the study informed consent form prior to the initiation of any study related procedures. The original signed informed consent for every participant will be stored in a locked, secure location that is in compliance with their IRB and institutional. Every study participant must be offered a copy of the signed consent form. Participants may contact [CONTACT_720617]. Prior to signing the informed consent form, research staff who are knowledgeable about the study will explain the study to the potential participant and provide the participant with a copy of the consent to read. If the participant is interested in participating in the study, a researcher who is authorized to obtain informed consent will review each section of the informed consent form in detail, answer any of the participant’s questions, and determine if the participant comprehends the information provided by [CONTACT_421719]. The participant will consent by [CONTACT_200874]. The person obtaining consent will also sign and date the consent document. The consent must be properly executed and complete to be valid. It is strongly recommended that another research staff member review the consent after it is signed to ensure that the consent is properly executed and complete. All persons obtaining consent must have completed appropriate training. The informed consent form must be updated or revised whenever important new safety information is available, or whenever the protocol is amended in a way that may affect a participants’ participation in the trial. A copy of the informed consent will be given to a prospective participant to review during the consent process and to keep for reference. The participant will be informed that their participation is voluntary and they may withdraw from the study at any time, for any reason without penalty. Study participation is voluntary and there are no benefits lost if an individual declines participation. Individuals who refuse to participate or who withdraw from the study will be treated

Source documents include all recordings of observations or notations of clinical activities and all reports and records necessary for the evaluation and reconstruction of the clinical research study. Whenever possible, the original recording of an observation should be retained as the source document; however, a photocopy is acceptable provided that it is a clear, legible, and exact duplication of the original document. 9.[ADDRESS_984198] and Trivedi will meet weekly to examine accumulating data to assure protection of participants’ safety while the study’s scientific goals are being met. These meetings will determine whether there is support for continuation of the trial, or evidence that study procedures should be changed, or if the trial should be halted, for reasons relating to the safety of the study participants, the efficacy of the treatment under study, or inadequate trial performance (e.g., poor recruitment). 9.8.2 Protocol Violations Reporting and Management A protocol departure is any departure from procedures and requirements outlined in the protocol. Protocol departures may occur on two levels, deviation versus violation. The difference between a protocol deviation and violation has to do with the seriousness of the event and the corrective action required. A protocol deviation is considered an action (or inaction) that by [CONTACT_720618] 29, [ADDRESS_984199] the safety, rights, or welfare of a study participant.  Protocol violations are departures that may compromise the participant safety, participant rights, inclusion/exclusion criteria or study data and could be cause for corrective actions if not rectified or prevented from re-occurrence. Protocol violations will be monitored for (1) significance, (2) frequency, and (3) impact on the study objectives, to ensure the integrity of the trial. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_720605] a departure from the protocol will be designated as a protocol deviation or a protocol violation. All protocol violations and deviations will be reported to the IRB as required.  9.8.[ADDRESS_984200] Confidentiality/Privacy Participant records will be held confidential by [CONTACT_360319], secure and separate storage of any documents that have participant identifiers, and secure computing procedures for entering and transferring electronic data. All research information obtained on participants is confidential, and disclosure to any third parties without specific authorization is strictly prohibited. To maintain subject privacy, all study forms and reports will be identified by a coded study identification number only.

  22        APPENDIX 1 Adverse Event Reporting Definitions and Procedures 1.0 Definitions of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events 1.1 Adverse Event (AE) An adverse event (AE) is defined as any reaction, side effect, or untoward event including any new illness, symptom, sign or worsening of a pre-existing condition or abnormality that occurs during the course of an individual’s participation in a clinical trial, whether or not the event is considered related to the clinical trial intervention. Stable chronic conditions, such as arthritis, which are present prior to an individual’s enrollment in a clinical trial and that do not worsen during the course of their participation are not considered AEs. In order to avoid the reporting of pre-existing conditions as new AEs, and to assist with the assessment of a condition that may have worsened in intensity or severity, a thorough medical history should be performed during the eligibility assessment phase to record any chronic, acute, or intermittent preexisting or current illnesses, diseases, symptoms, or laboratory signs. An AE case report form (CRF) is used to capture reported AEs (as defined by [CONTACT_760]) and may also be used to record follow-up information for unresolved or ongoing events that were reported previously. A site study investigator is responsible for reviewing and characterizing each AE that is reported, and is expected to follow appropriate reporting procedures. Adverse events and their resolution outcome should be elicited from study participants at each study related contact.  The site must actively seek information about the AE until it is resolved or medically stable or until the participant is lost to follow-up and terminated from the study. 1.2 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) A serious adverse event (SAE) is an adverse event that is deemed serious by a study investigator because it meets one or more of the following criteria (although the event may meet more than one of the criteria below, investigator’s should choose only the most serious when reporting the event): An adverse event is serious if it results in: • Death: A death that occurs either during the course of the clinical trial or that comes to the attention of the investigator during the protocol-defined follow-up period and after the completion of therapy, whether or not it is considered treatment-related must be reported. • Life threatening: Any adverse event that when it occurs places the participant at immediate risk of death (i.e., it does not include a reaction that had it occurred in a more serious form, might have caused death). • Admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_720607]. • A persistent or significant disability or incapacity. • A congenital anomaly or birth defect. 
 
  23        • Requiring a medical intervention to prevent one of the above outcomes. A SAE case report form is used to capture reported SAEs and may also be used to record follow-up information for unresolved or ongoing events that were reported previously. A site study investigator at the site is responsible for reviewing and characterizing each SAE that is reported, and is expected to follow appropriate reporting procedures, including the reporting of the event to their IRB as per local IRB guidelines. Serious adverse events will be followed until resolved or considered stable, with reporting to the NIDA appointed Safety Monitor through the follow-up period. The site must actively seek information about the SAE as appropriate until the SAE is resolved or medically stable or until the participant is lost to follow-up and terminated from the study. In the event that a FDA MedWatch form is generated and distributed by [CONTACT_720620] a result of a related and unexpected event, the site staff will be responsible for reporting this to their IRB as per local IRB guidelines and for maintaining this information in their regulatory binders. 1.[ADDRESS_984208]/Progress Note and not separately reported as an AE or SAE. Pregnancies will be followed through resolution, regardless of the outcome. 2.[ADDRESS_984209] study visit or the participant’s study termination date, whichever comes first. Follow up of an event will continue for up to [ADDRESS_984210] the Adverse Event assessment date. Qualified research staff is responsible for consistently and thoroughly eliciting medical and/or psychiatric AEs/SAEs from participants during every study assessment visit in order to complete the AE/SAE CRFs in a timely manner. This may require consent in the form of a release of information (ROI) from the participant in order to request medical records, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8838], etc. Qualified research staff is responsible for reviewing all clinician progress notes and checklists following each participant contact [CONTACT_720621]/SAEs have been appropriately reported. Reported AEs/SAEs will be followed until resolution or stabilization or study end, and any serious and related AEs/SAEs will be followed until resolution or stabilization, even beyond the end of the study. The study principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_9835], including ensuring human research subject protection by [CONTACT_9939], trained research staff and medical clinicians to assess, report, and monitor adverse events. 3.0 Assessment of Severity and Relatedness A study investigator is responsible for reviewing all reported AEs on a weekly basis in order to characterize their seriousness, severity, and relatedness to the study intervention. 3.1 Severity 
 
  24        The seriousness of an event is determined by [CONTACT_720622] a serious adverse event. The severity of an event refers to the intensity of the event. Severity grades are assigned by [CONTACT_720623]. Adverse events severity grade definitions are provided below: Grade 1 Mild Transient or mild discomfort (< 48 hours), no or minimal medical intervention/therapy required, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_266772] (non-prescription or single-use prescription therapy may be employed to relieve symptoms, e.g., aspi[INVESTIGATOR_266773], acetaminophen for post-surgical pain). Grade 2 Moderate Mild to moderate limitation in activity some assistance may be needed; no or minimal intervention/therapy required, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9841]. Grade 3 Severe Marked limitation in activity, some assistance usually required; medical intervention/therapy and/or required hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9841]. Grade 4 Life-threatening Extreme limitation in activity, significant assistance required; significant medical intervention/therapy required, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27595]. Grade 5 Death   
 
  25        3.2 Relatedness The relatedness of the event refers to causality of the event to the study intervention. Relatedness requires an assessment of temporal relationships, underlying diseases or other causative factors and plausibility. Relationship to intervention is defined as: • Definitely related: An adverse event that follows a temporal sequence from administration of the test intervention and/or procedure and follows a known response pattern to the test intervention and/or procedure; and, when appropriate to the protocol, is confirmed by [CONTACT_318207][INVESTIGATOR_720608]’s clinical state or by [CONTACT_43593][INVESTIGATOR_014]. • Probably related: An adverse event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the test intervention and/or procedure and follows a known response pattern to the test intervention and/or procedure and cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_82977]’s clinical state or other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. • Possibly related: An adverse event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the test intervention and/or procedure and follows a known response pattern to the test intervention and/or procedure, but could have been produced by [CONTACT_2299]’s clinical state or by [CONTACT_43593][INVESTIGATOR_014]. • Unrelated: An adverse event that does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence after administration of the test intervention and/or procedure and is most likely explained by [CONTACT_2299]’s clinical disease state or by [CONTACT_43593][INVESTIGATOR_014]. 4.0 Reporting Procedures of AE/SAEs Standard reporting, or the process of reporting an event within 7 days of the site becoming aware of the event, is required for all reportable AEs, whether or not they are considered related to the clinical trial participation. Expedited reporting, or the process of reporting an event within 24 hours of the occurrence of the event and/or the site's knowledge of the event, is required for all SAEs, including deaths. The SAE case report form and a progress note summary as well as any other relevant documentation related to the event should also be submitted with the initial report. If complete information about the event is not available at the time of the initial report, the event should still be reported with as much information as possible within the [ADDRESS_984211] annually. Details regarding adverse events, if requested by [CONTACT_941], local IRB or regulatory authorities, should be summarized in writing by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_720609]. 5.0 Discontinuation of Participant From a Clinical Trial Related to a Reported AE/SAE The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_720610]/her clinical judgment in order to determine whether or not an AE/SAE is of sufficient severity to require that a participant be removed from the study intervention. If necessary, the Investigator may suspend any trial treatments and institute the necessary medical therapy or refer a participant to appropriate medical care in order to protect a participant from any immediate danger. Subsequent review of the event(s) by [CONTACT_720624] a site. The study sponsor retains the authority to suspend additional enrollment and treatments for an individual study site or the entire study as applicable. A participant also has the right to voluntarily withdraw from treatment due to what he/she perceives as an intolerable adverse event or for any other reason. If voluntary withdrawal is requested, the participant should be asked to continue (at least limited) scheduled evaluations, complete an end-of-study evaluation and be referred to appropriate care for medical supervision until the symptoms of any adverse event resolve or until their condition becomes stable.

Version # / Version Date: Version 5 / [ADDRESS_1203640] chemoradiotherapy with weekly cisplatin and BKM120 to 
assess tolerability of this combination in high risk patients with locally advanced Squamous Cell 
Carcinoma of the Head and Neck (SCCHN). We will also obtain preliminary information about the 
efficacy of this treatment.
The design of this study follows a classical 3+[ADDRESS_1203641] of care.
Patients will be assessed weekly for adverse events for the duration of the treatment (2 weeks of 
BKM120 and 7 weeks of CRT = 9 weeks) and every [ADDRESS_1203642].
Fresh biopsies will be obtained prior to BKM120 and after 7-10d of treatment but prior to start of 
radiation treatment. Biopsies will be snap frozen and used for correlative studies. Biopsies are optional 
but encouraged in patients with accessible tumors.
1.2 Primary Objectives
Determine Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of BKM120/cisplatin in combination with radiation 
therapy in patients with locally advanced squamous cell cancer of the head and neck.
1.3 Secondary Objectives
Assess:
Overall response rate
Time to progression
Survival
Mood alteration from BKM120
Activity of BKM120 as single agent in sequential biopsies
2. BACKGROUND
2.1 Study Disease
There are >50 000 new cases of squamous cell cancer of the head and neck in the US annually and it is 
the fifth leading cause of death among cancer patients (Jemal, et al 2010)
Protocol #: 14-008
Version # / Version Date: Version 5 / [ADDRESS_1203643] patients, 
treatment consists of concurrent chemotherapy plus radiation (chemoradiotherapy, CRT). The standard 
chemotherapy agent used in conjunction over the 7 week radiotherapy course (70 Gy, 35 fractions) is 
cisplatin which can be given either as a bolus infusion every 3 weeks or weekly. Many oncologists 
prefer weekly cisplatin because of better tolerability compared to bolus cisplatin and similar efficacy.
The cure rate of locally advanced stage III or IV disease is only around 50% historically and recurrence 
rates have remained high (Forastiere 2000). The primary risk is loco-regional failure, often within the 
field of prior radiotherapy. Maximizing efficacy of radiotherapy is therefore critical to improve 
prognosis.
In recent years, HPV positive squamous cell cancer has been recognized as a clinical entity that is 
characterized by [CONTACT_863278]. These patients are typi[INVESTIGATOR_863242] a history of smoking (Gillison 2010). Trials are under way that target this 
patient population with the goal of reducing the intensity of treatment and thus the severity of acute and 
long term side effects. However, these patients represent a minority among the head and neck cancer 
population. If a significant smoking history (>10 pack years) is present, the prognosis is poor, even in 
those patients who have HPV positive disease (Ang, et al 2010). Recurrences present primarily as loco- 
regional failures within the radiation field suggesting resistance to radiation.
Resistance to radiotherapy is complex and poorly understood. Recent data suggest however, that PI3 
Kinase/AKT activity is closely connected with three major radioresistance mechanisms: intrinsic 
radioresistance; tumor-cell proliferation; and hypoxia. Conversely, PI3K inhibition is associated with 
radiosensitization (Hosoi, et al 1998; Bussink 2008; Nakamura, et al 2005). Furthermore, activation of 
the PI3K pathway is frequent in head and neck cancer, either through mutations of PI3Kor other 
components of the PI3K pathway such as mTOR, AKT or PTEN which are present in almost one third 
of all head and neck squamous cell cancers, but may also occur in response to radiotherapy in cases 
without mutations along the PI3K pathway (Stransky et al 2011, Lui at a 2013, Toulany et al 2005). 
HPV positive oropharyngeal cancer, which accounts for a large portion of newly diagnosed patients 
with locally advanced SCCHN is also frequently associated with activating PI3K mutations. 
Furthermore, our own data suggest that presence of genetic mutations of the NFE2L2/KEAP1/CUL3 
pathway which is present in one-third of patients with HNSCCs may play a particularly significant role 
and radioresistance could be restored with BKM120 (Abazeed, et al 2013). As a pan-PI3K inhibitor, 
BKM120 should thus act as an effective radiosensitizer and could help to target a key pathway in 
SCCHN, thus improving outcomes.
2.2 Study Drug: BKM120
NVP-BKM120 (BKM120) is a potent and highly specific oral pan-class I PI3K inhibitor that is a 2,6- 
dimorpholino pyrimidine derivatives. This compound has been studied extensively in non-clinical 
models and is currently being evaluated in clinical trials.
2.2.[ADDRESS_1203644] and mechanism of action
The phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) signaling regulates diverse cellular functions, including cell 
proliferation, survival, translational regulation of protein synthesis, glucose metabolism, cell migration, 
and angiogenesis (Katso, et al 2001). PI3K signaling also serves a central role in the pathogenesis of
Protocol #: 14-008
Version # / Version Date: Version 5 / [ADDRESS_1203645] 2021
7numerous forms of neoplasia. At the structural level, the enzyme PI3K is composed of a 110-kDa 
catalytic subunit and an 85-kDa adaptor subunit. The PI3K signaling is modulated by [CONTACT_863279], including growth factors (such as EGF, IGF-1, and FGF), hormones (such as estrogen and 
thyroid hormone), integrins, intracellular calcium levels, and RAS signaling. PI3K signaling is 
negatively regulated at the level of PIP3 clearance by [CONTACT_236020], such as the 
phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) protein and the inositol 5-phosphatase-2 (SHIP2) protein. 
Constitutive activation of PI3K signaling is known to be a critical step in mediating the transforming 
potential of oncogenes and tumor suppressors and in many tumor types (Liu 2009). Resistance to a 
variety of therapeutic interventions, including chemotherapy, hormonal therapy and anti-HER2 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], can also be linked to constitutive activation of the PI3K pathway (McCubrey 2006). 
Moreover, preliminary data suggest that activation of the PI3K pathway may be a predictor of poor 
prognostic outcome in many cancers. Molecular changes leading to constitutive activation of the PI3K 
pathway are diverse and include, but are not limited to,
a. Gain-of-function mutations of PI3K subunits (PIK3CA encoding the PI3K catalytic subunit p110α; 
genes encoding the p85 regulatory subunit) or oncogenes encoding positive regulators of PI3K (e.g.,
HER2, EGFR, RAS, Src-family proteins) or
b. Loss-of-function mutations or epi[INVESTIGATOR_539362]3K signaling 
(e.g., loss of PTEN expression or function) (Chow 2006, Cully 2006)
Together these observations suggest that PI3K pathway could be a critical therapeutic target for the 
treatment of patients with advanced solid malignancies who often have limited therapeutic options 
beyond institutional standard of care. Hence, the pan-PI3K inhibitor BKM120 treatment potentially 
addresses an unmet medical need in such patients.

8Figure 1: Schematic representation of the PI3K pathway
2.2.[ADDRESS_1203647] class I PI3K (p110α, -β, -δ and -γ), Class III (Vps34), the class IV mTOR related 
PI3K or PI4Kβ, was assessed using either using a luciferase luminescence (class I or III PI3Ks and PI4Kβ) or 
a TR-FRET assay (Class IV mTOR). The IC50 in these assays is outlined below in Table 1.

Protocol #: 14-008
Version # / Version Date: Version 5 / [ADDRESS_1203648] 2021
9Table 1:        Inhibitory activities (IC50) of BKM120 against other PI3K or related kinases
BKM120 significantly inhibits p110α and the most common p110α mutations (H1047R, E454K, E542K), 
p110β, p110δ and p110γ but not the related proteins Vps34, mTOR or PI4Kβ. Hence BKM120 is classified 
as a pure pan-class I PI3K inhibitor. Enzymatic characterization of the inhibitory properties of the compound 
revealed that BKM120 is a mixed inhibitor of PI3Kα with a strong competitive component (largest on 
Vmax). The cocrystal X-ray structure of BKM120 with PI3Kγ confirmed that BKM120 interacts with PI3K 
into the ATP catalytic cleft. The PI3K pathway regulates the activity of the mTORC1 complex, when cells 
are challenged through mitogenic stimuli. In order to assess in cells the potential impact of the BKM120 on 
the mTORC1 complex, the compound was tested in TSC1 null cells. These cells express a constitutively 
activated mTORC1 complex that uncouples the mTOR pathway from the PI3K upstream input 
(Kwiatkowski 2003). When exposed to TSC1 null MEFS, BKM120 reduced the S235/236P-RPS6 levels 
with an IC50 of [ADDRESS_1203649] mechanism of action (BCR-Abl inhibitor STI571, mTORC1 
allosteric inhibitor RAD001), BKM120 is able to decrease the phosphorylation status of various either direct 
([COMPANY_004]3β, FKHRL1/FOXO3a) or indirect downstream Akt effectors (p70S6K, through mTOR) in the PTEN 
null U87MG cell line, as efficiently as prototypi[INVESTIGATOR_235959]3K inhibitors such as LY294002 and Wortmannin.
2.2.3 Preclinical Safety
Please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure for additional information on the preclinical testing of BKM120.
2.2.4 Pharmacodynamics
BKM120 inhibits wild-type PI3K  (IC 50: 35 nM), with at least 50-fold selectivity towards this target 
compared to other protein kinases as well as against somatic PI3K activating mutants (H1047R-, E542K-
, and E545K-p110), the other three PI3K paralogs as well as the direct downstream effector AKT. 
BKM120 does not inhibit the related kinases mTOR or Vps34, nor does it inhibit other receptors and ion 
channels profiled (IC 50 >10 M). BKM120 reduces the phosphorylation of the direct downstream effector 
Akt in relevant tumor cell lines (e.g., IC50 93 nM for S473P-Akt in Rat1-p110cells). This biological activity 
correlates with inhibition of various other downstream signaling components and with antiproliferative 
activity in a variety of tumor cell lines. BKM120 demonstrates significant tumor growth inhibition in 
relevant tumor xenografts in mice and rats when administered orally, including models of renal cell cancer 
(RENCA, 786-0, Caki-1), glioblastoma multiforme (U87MG), prostate cancer (PC3M), lung cancer (A549, 
NCI-H1975), ovarian cancer (A2780), colorectal cancer (HCT116, HCT-15) and melanoma (A2058, A375).

10In vivo PK/PD analyses of tumor tissues shows a good correlation between exposure, PI3K pathway 
blockade (S473P-Akt levels), and anti-tumor activity.
2.2.5 Nonclinical pharmacokinetics and metabolism
BKM120 showed favorable pharmacokinetic properties in all animal species tested. The absorption of [14C]- 
BKM120-related radioactivity was >84% in the rat. Oral bioavailability was high in rats (73%), was 
complete in dogs, and was moderate in monkeys (42%). The estimated steady state plasma volume of 
distribution (Vss) was high (3.0-3.5 L/kg) in all species tested, suggesting a wide tissue distribution. 
BKM120 was found to cross the blood brain barrier in rats with a tissue-to-plasma ratio of approximately 2 
([COMPANY_001] internal data). BKM120 is moderately bound to plasma protein in all species examined (about 
80%). In vitro metabolism studies using human liver microsomes showed that oxidative phase I metabolism 
of BKM120 was predominantly mediated by [CONTACT_097]3A4 (estimated fm > 0.9). Formation of a BKM120 N- 
glucuronide conjugate (Phase II metabolism) via the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase-1 family, polypeptide 
A4 (UGT1A4) was also observed in human liver microsomes supplemented with uridine 5'-diphospho- 
glucuronic acid (UDPGA). BKM120 and metabolites have a low potential for covalent binding to protein. 
BKM120 was determined to be a weak reversible inhibitor of CYP3A4 (IC50 = 8 µM, Ki = 13.4 µM 
unbound) at concentrations reached in the clinic. BKM120 very weakly inhibited the CYP2C family (2C8, 
2C9 and 2C19) with IC50 values ranging from 35-65 μM (34-59 μM unbound). BKM120 did not show 
time-dependent inhibition of CYP450 enzymes. In GLP toxicology studies, BKM120 exposure in terms of 
AUC0-24h and Cmax increased in a dose proportional manner in rat and dog. Results from the rat ADME 
study showed that radioactivity was mainly excreted into the feces. Renal excretion was minor. There was 
no noticeable drug accumulation in dog or male rats after 13 weeks of daily dosing. There was a slight 
accumulation in female rat (< 2 fold). Further information concerning the pharmacokinetic and 
pharmacodynamics properties of BKM120 may be found in the Investigator Brochure.
2.2.6 Safety pharmacology and toxicology
Safety pharmacology studies in rats revealed no effects on neuronal (behavior) or respi[INVESTIGATOR_263576]. 
Cardiac safety studies, conducted in vitro and in vivo did not indicate a prominent electrophysiological risk. 
No relevant electrophysiological effect was seen in dogs. The only effect considered relevant was a trend 
towards an increase in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, which was observed in two dog telemetry 
studies. In rats and dogs, clinical pathology and histopathology findings showed quantitative reductions of 
lymphoid and erythroid counts and lymphoid tissue hypoplasia. The pancreas was seen to be affected by 
[CONTACT_540813]120, particularly in dogs, where acinar cell toxicity was seen in the exocrine part of this 
organ. At higher doses in the 2-week dose-range-finding study in rats, there were histopathological findings 
in both the endocrine as well as the exocrine pancreas. Male sexual organs and associated tissues were found 
to be targets of toxicity in both rats and dogs. Changes included minimal to slight germ cell depletion, 
formation of spermatic giant cells and abnormal spermatids, and cellular debris in epi[INVESTIGATOR_235961]. 
Testicular toxicity did not fully reverse after the 4-week treatment-free period in rats (highest dose), although 
a clear trend towards recovery was seen. In individual female rats, minimal to slight cyst formation occurred 
in the Graafian follicles. In dogs, there was no effect on female sexual organs. Glucose homeostasis was 
affected in various species (mice, rats, dogs), as expected from the mode of action of BKM120. However, 
these effects were minimal in both rats and dogs at the doses used in the 4-week studies.
Other safety considerations include:
After up to 2 weeks of treatment with up to 2.5 mg/kg/day of BKM120, alterations in the levels of 
multiple brain neurotransmitters were seen in rats.
Protocol #: 14-008
Version # / Version Date: Version 5 / [ADDRESS_1203651] 2021
11No evidence for a direct DNA interaction was found in an Ames test and two chromosome aberration 
tests in vitro with BKM120. However, evidence of a genotoxic potential with BKM120 has been 
seen in vitro and in vivo and is likely due to an aneugenic effect.
No phototoxic potential or any effect on wound healing has been identified with BKM120 in pre- 
clinical studies.
In conclusion, the majority of the observed effects were related to the pharmacological activity of BKM120 
as an inhibitor of PI3K, such as a potential influence on glucose homeostasis and the risk of increased blood 
pressure.
Please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure for additional information on the preclinical testing of BKM120.
2.2.7 Pharmacodynamic biomarkers
The preclinical in vivo studies with xenografted tumors in mice indicate that detectable inhibition of AKT 
phosphorylation, which is an accurate readout of PI3K activity, as well as further suppression of downstream 
signaling (e.g., phosphorylation of S6) was obtained soon after BKM120 administration. PI3K is known to 
serve a pi[INVESTIGATOR_863243], and preclinical studies in which oral glucose 
and intraperitoneal insulin tolerance tests were performed suggesting post-treatment induction of insulin 
insensitivity/resistance. Therefore, throughout the trial the circulating levels of several markers for glucose 
metabolism (e.g., glucose, insulin, C-peptide) will be assessed as an additional measure of PI3K signaling 
modulation.
2.2.8 Clinical experience
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical experience with BKM120
As of September 2012, over 600 patients were enrolled into clinical studies with BKM120 (as 
single agent or combinations). The [COMPANY_001] sponsored clinical studies were:
 Phase I single agent studies [CBKM120X2101], [CBKM120X1101], and [CBKM120Z2102]
 Phase II single agent studies [CBKM120C2201] and [CBKM120D2201]
 Phase I combination studies [CBKM120B2101], [CBKM120X2107], [BKM120E2101], 
[CBEZ235A2118], [LDE225X2114], [CSTI571X2101], and [CMEK162X2101].
 Phase II combination studies [CBKM120F2202]
 Phase III combination study [CBKM120F2302]
For the interest of the current protocol, results presented below will focus on phase I single agent studies 
([CBKM120X2101], [CBKM120X1101]), and phase I combinations in breast cancer patients 
([CBKM120X2107], [CBEZ235A2118]). Please refer to the current version of the IB for more detailed 
information.
[IP_ADDRESS] Human safety and tolerability data
Study recruitment in study [CBKM120X2101] has been completed with forty (40) patients included in the 
dose escalation phase at 6 dose levels (all once daily) (12.5 mg (1 patient); 25 mg (2), 50 mg (5), 80 mg
Protocol #: 14-008
Version # / Version Date: Version 5 / [ADDRESS_1203652] 2021
12(11), 100 mg (17), 150 mg (4)) . Dose limiting toxicities were hyperglycemia, skin rash, epi[INVESTIGATOR_50684], 
mood disorder, joint pain. The MTD for BKM120 given as single agent, once daily was established at 100 
mg/day (Bendell 2012). Forty-three additional patients were treated in the expansion cohort at 100 mg/day. 
At the cut-off date of 4th July 2011 (Graña 2011), patient characteristics of 82 patients analyzed were as 
follows: median age 55 years (range 30–78); ECOG performance status 0/1/2 for 35/46/1 patients, 
respectively. The safety experience for this single agent trial of BKM120 is described in Table 2.

A second single agent trial, [CBKM120X1101] was a phase I dose escalation study in Japanese patients 
with advanced solid tumors with dose levels ranging from 25 to 100mg/day (Doi 2011). Enrolment of 15 
patients has been completed, including 9 patients at 100 mg/day. One DLT (G4 hepatic function abnormal) 
was observed in the 100 mg/day group. The most common G3 or G4 adverse events occurring in at least 2 
patients were hepatic function abnormal in 6 patients including transaminase increase in 2 patients, G3 
anemia in 2 patients, hypokalemia in 2 patients. The recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for Japanese has 
been determined at 100 mg/day, as in the western population.
The safety and efficacy of BKM120 combined with trastuzumab in patients with relapsing HER2- 
overexpressing BC who have previously failed trastuzumab are being explored in a phase Ib/II, multi-center 
study [CBKM120X2107]. The combination of BKM120 and trastuzumab was shown to be tolerable, and 
with one dose-limiting toxicity (G3 asthenia), the MTD for BKM120 was declared at 100 mg/day (Saura 
2011). Among the 18 patients evaluated in the Phase Ib part, the following G3/G4 AEs were observed: 
asthenia, ALT elevation, hyperglycemia, mood alteration, affective disorder, hypersensitivity, 
photosensitivity reaction, and rash. These AEs were all short-lived and reversible with either dose 
interruption or modifications as needed. In the phase II portion of the study, as of June 2012, [ADDRESS_1203653] been enrolled and received BKM120 at the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of 100 mg/day in 
combination with trastuzumab (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_863244] 2012). Overall the treatment was well tolerated. Most 
common AEs (>15%) included gastro-intestinal toxicity (e.g. diarrhea, nausea, stomatitis), rash, fatigue, 
transaminase increase, hyperglycemia, depression and anorexia. No G4 AEs have been reported. Most 
common G3 treatment related AEs included transaminase increase (~10%), rash (9%) and fatigue (6%), and 
were consistent with phase Ib findings with as well as single agent BKM120.

13Details on liver toxicity, mood alterations, pneumonitis, hyperglycemia, skin rash and hypersensitivity as 
side effects of BKM120 are presented below.
[IP_ADDRESS] Liver Toxicity
Liver toxicity has been analyzed based on a search of multiple MedDRA event terms and is presented in 
Table 3. Liver function test (LFT) alterations observed during ongoing and completed studies have been 
mostly transaminase enzyme increases (ALT and/or AST). Data suggest a higher rate of grade 3/4 liver 
enzyme elevations in Japanese patients (44.4%) in [CBKM120X1101] study, however, the number of 
patients (9 patients) treated at 100mg in this study was limited.
Although transaminase increases are relatively common, only a few of the patients with LFT alterations had 
other simultaneous observations related to impaired liver function (e.g. bilirubin increase or clinical 
symptoms). Based on these findings, conservative inclusion criteria and guidelines to monitor and to follow 
patients with LFT alterations (including dose and schedule modifications) are currently implemented in 
study protocols investigating BKM120. Please refer to the respective inclusion/exclusion criteria.
[IP_ADDRESS] Mood disorders
Recently, a number of publications demonstrated that the modulation of AKT/[COMPANY_004]3 signaling pathway by 
[CONTACT_560054] (Beaulieu 2009). Preclinical studies conducted 
in rats to investigate the effect of BKM120 on different neurotransmitters have shown that repeated 
administration of BKM120 resulted in an enhanced decrease in glutamate, dopamine, serotonin and 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_863245].
Psychiatric side effects events have been reported in patients treated with BKM120 and are currently under 
investigation. The current data does not allow the identification of any sign or symptom which could predict

Protocol #: 14-008
Version # / Version Date: Version 5 / [ADDRESS_1203655] range of AEs including (but not 
limited to) depression, anxiety, mood alteration, confusion, affective disorders, insomnia, hallucination, 
panic disorders, irritability or difficulties to concentrate have been reported.
Considering the initial symptoms reported during the first-in-man [CBKM120X2101] study, mood 
disorders have been analyzed based on HLGT 'Mood disorders and disturbances NEC' or HLGT 'Personality 
disorders disturbances in behavior' or HLGT “Psychiatric and behavioral symptoms NEC” or HLGT 
“suicidal and behaviors NEC”. The frequency of mood disorders thus defined, regardless of study drug 
relationship, ranged from 6.3% in [CBKM120B2101] study to 50.0% in dose escalation part of 
[CBKM120X2107] study, however, the majority of events were of grade 1 or 2 severity (Table 4).
Therefore, patients must be regularly and closely monitored for signs and symptoms of neuropsychiatric 
disorders with particular attention to changes in mood and personality. To support the identification and the 
assessment of psychiatric disorders, two self-assessment questionnaires, the Patient Health Questionnaire-
9 (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), are part of the protocol. Any AEs 
(symptom/diagnosis) should be accurately reported using CTCAE toxicity/grading. A consultation with a 
psychiatrist is strongly recommended for any psychiatric adverse event grade ≥ 1. Protocol guidelines 
further disqualify patients with an active and/or history of major psychiatric disorder. Please refer to the 
respective inclusion/exclusion criteria.
[IP_ADDRESS] Lung Toxicity/ Pneumonitis
Lung changes compatible with pneumonitis have not been observed in the preclinical setting. Among the 
current studies, pneumonitis was reported in five cases and interstitial lung disease in one further case. One 
case of pneumonitis had a fatal outcome in a complex clinical context, combining progression of lung 
metastases and possible infection with pneumocystis carinii or cytomegalovirus. Apart from this fatal case, 
the conditions were resolved or improving at the latest report (except one non-suspected SAE which was

Version # / Version Date: Version 5 / [ADDRESS_1203656] 2021
15unchanged).
The currently available data still do not enable a clear assessment about the causal relationship of 
pneumonitis with BKM120 treatment. Newly appearing or significant changes in pulmonary symptoms 
(which cannot be explained by [CONTACT_54648]), should be carefully followed with appropriate 
management as per institutional guidelines and the guidelines provided in the protocol. Please refer to Table 
15 for more detailed guideline on the diagnosis and management of Pneumonitis.
[IP_ADDRESS] Hyperglycemia events
The PI3K/AKT pathway plays a significant role in regulating glucose metabolism, particularly by [CONTACT_863280]. Therefore, hyperglycemia is considered as an “on 
target” effect of BKM120. Regular monitoring of FPG, HbA1c, and insulin C-peptide is implemented in 
BKM120 protocols to evaluate this pharmacodynamics effect. Transient increases of plasma glucose levels 
have been reported commonly in patients treated with BKM120. Hyperglycemia observed at 100 mg/day, 
regardless of study drug relationship, in ongoing BKM120 studies are summarized in Table 5.
The highest rate of hyperglycemia (57.1%) was reported in [CBKM120C2201], a Phase II study conducted 
in patients with advanced endometrial carcinoma, as this was the only study among those listed allowing 
the enrollment of patients with controlled diabetes mellitus.
However, so far, there were only two patients that experienced a grade [ADDRESS_1203657] dose level (150mg/day) in [CBKM120X2101] study. In order to mitigate the potential 
risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_863246], only patients with normal glycaemia defined as fasting 
plasma glucose (FPG) ≤ 120 mg/dL are eligible for study entry. Patients who have a poorly controlled 
diabetes mellitus defined as (HbA1c >8%) are excluded. In addition, detailed guidelines to monitor patients 
are recommended including: regular monitoring of FPG to early identify hyperglycemia and prevent

Version # / Version Date: Version 5 / [ADDRESS_1203658] 2021
16acute/sub-acute complications, caution warranted for patients with history of DM, or taking corticosteroids, 
or with other severe medical conditions (e.g. infections). Hyperglycemia management guidance also 
includes: dietetic measures and appropriate anti-diabetic medications as per investigator’s decision and/or 
local guidelines, consider oral anti-diabetics such as metformin as first-line treatment for sustained and more 
severe hyperglycemia (other drugs as appropriate), if sulfonylurea or insulin are initiated, patients should 
be instructed on how to recognize (and treat) hypoglycemia, for patients with history of DM, management 
should be based on prior anti-DM treatment. Detailed guidelines to monitor and manage patients who 
develop hyperglycemia are provided in Table 5.
[IP_ADDRESS] Skin rash and hypersensitivity
Skin rash is commonly observed in patients treated with BKM120. The rate of skin rash and other related 
event terms ranged from 18.4% to 41.4% in single agent studies with a representative number of patients 
treated with 100mg of BKM120. In one study with nine evaluable patients, seven patients (77.8%) reported 
such events Table 6.
Studies of BKM120 in combination with other agents tended to report slightly higher frequencies (e.g. 
combination with MEK inhibitor). The skin rashes seen have no typi[INVESTIGATOR_863247], are 
mainly papulo-macular (only a minority acneiform) and are frequently associated with pruritus. Events have 
been reversible after treatment interruption and/ or dose reduction. Effective medications have included 
antihistamines, topi[INVESTIGATOR_40826]/or low-dose systemic corticosteroids (the latter should be used 
with caution due to the increased risk of hyperglycemia). There have been few cases reported of allergic 
reactions and DRESS (drug rash with eosinophilia and system symptoms), but these have not been of acute 
onset or of a severe nature. Complementary information collected suggests that sun exposure may 
exacerbate the condition and should be avoided; however, genuine photosensitivity reaction has not been 
confirmed and no phototoxic potential seen pre-clinically. Patients are advised (e.g. in the written patient 
information) to avoid sun exposure, or take measures to protect themselves from intense sunlight, during 
study treatment.

[IP_ADDRESS] Human pharmacokinetic and metabolism data
Preliminary clinical pharmacokinetic data of BKM120 after single and multiple daily dosing is available 
from the first-in-human trial [CBKM120X2101]. BKM120 was administered as a capsule (doses ranging 
between 12.5 and 150 mg) and full pharmacokinetic profiles were collected on Day 1, Day 8 and Day 28 of 
Cycle 1. BKM120 was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_24584], with the median time to reach the peak plasma concentration 
(Tmax) ranging from 1.0 to 1.75 hours following administration. Tmax was independent of dose and was 
not altered after multiple oral doses. Variability in systemic drug exposure was moderate at all dose levels. 
At 100 mg the variability in systemic drug exposure and Cmax (CV %) at steady-state was moderate, about 
36% and 25%, respectively. During once daily dosing, plasma BKM120 concentrations were found to 
accumulate in reaching steady-state. After one week of oral daily dosing (day 8), both Cmax and AUC0- 
24h were approximately 3-fold higher than after a single dose (day 1). The mean accumulation ratio (Racc) 
of BKM120 at 100 mg was 2.7 and 3.3 on days 8 and 28, respectively, indicating the absence of significant 
drug accumulation after day 8.
The decay in BKM120 plasma concentration over time was bi-exponential, with an apparent long terminal 
half-life. The mean T1/2,acc (effective half-life, obtained from drug accumulation) calculated from 
exposure data at day 28 ranged between 38 and 49 hours across all dose levels. T1/2,acc was found to be 
independent of dose. Based on the effective half-life, steady state BKM120 plasma levels can be expected 
to be reached after 1 week of daily dosing. Furthermore the preliminary PK data within the Japanese 
population [CBKM120X1101] show no significant differences in Cmax or AUC0-24h with the Caucasian 
population [CBKM120X2101]. A preliminary population PK analysis, including data from studies 
[CBKM120X2101] and [CBKM120X1101] confirmed those findings ([COMPANY_001] internal data).
In study [CBKM120B2101], BKM120 was administered with [COMPANY_004]1120212 (a MEK inhibitor). Single dose 
pharmacokinetics of BKM120 appeared to be unaffected by [CONTACT_863281]1120212. 
Concurrent chronic daily administration of both drugs, however, consistently resulted in a dose- and time-
Protocol #: 14-008
Version # / Version Date: Version 5 / [ADDRESS_1203660] 2021
18dependent decrease in BKM120 systemic drug exposure. After 28 days of once daily combination treatment 
of BKM120 with [COMPANY_004]1120212 (1.5-2.0 mg), exposure of BKM120 at system steady-state was decreased 
by [CONTACT_3450] 45-50%, when compared to the mean value determined from [CBKM120X2101]. 
Decrease in exposure was less pronounced at lower doses of [COMPANY_004]1120212 (0.5- 1 mg) (approximately 25%). 
The overall drug clearance of BKM120 increased up to 2-fold in the presence [COMPANY_004]1120212. This dose and 
time dependent effect of [COMPANY_004]1120212 on BKM120 oral clearance is most likely explained by [CONTACT_863282]3A4, a property of [COMPANY_004]1120212, which has been demonstrated in vitro. These findings are also 
consistent with a high dependence of BKM120 clearance on CYP3A4 activity. Similar changes in the 
pharmacokinetics of BKM120 could be expected to occur when other inducers of CYP3A4 are combined with 
BKM120 treatment (see concomitant medication ). The pharmacokinetics of [COMPANY_004]1120212 was not altered 
by [CONTACT_540825]120.
In study [CBKM120X2107] a daily dosing regimen of BKM120 was tested in combination with weekly 
infusions of trastuzumab in patients with relapsed HER2-overexpressing breast cancer. Preliminary 
pharmacokinetic data indicated that the systemic drug exposure (Cmax and AUC) of oral BKM120 in 
combination with trastuzumab was similar to the single agent data. Trastuzumab trough levels were 
consistent with those previously reported to be therapeutic (i.e., generally greater than 20 μg/ml).
2.2.9 Clinical efficacy data
Sixty six patients were evaluable for response in study [CBKM120X2101] where all patients in the 
expansion cohort were required to have mutated and/or amplified PIK3CA and/or mutated PTEN or null/low 
PTEN protein expression: partial tumor responses (PR) were observed in [ADDRESS_1203661] cancer and the other 2 not confirmed ([ADDRESS_1203662] cancer and 1 patient with parotid carcinoma) (Graña 2011). The first patient 
was a [ADDRESS_1203663] cancer assessed as triple 
negative (ER-, PgR-, HER2-), PI3KCA wild type, PTEN IHC positive. Since 2006 she received many 
previous anticancer agents (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, gemcitabine, docetaxel, paclitaxel, 
vinorelbine, capecitabine, etoposide, anastrazole). As progressive disease developed (bulky lymph node 
involvement and local breast relapse), she was enrolled (April 2009) in the Phase I study of BKM120 in the 
100 mg/day cohort. A metabolic response (61% decrease in SUV) was observed after [ADDRESS_1203664] partial response (66% tumor shrinkage) after [ADDRESS_1203665] cancer, assessed as ER positive, HER2 negative, PI3KCA mutated (E545K & H1047Y), 
PTEN IHC positive. She had been previously treated with several antineoplastic agents. When she received 
BKM120 at 100 mg/day (January 2010), she had measurable metastases in the brain, lung and liver. At the 
second radiological assessment after receiving 4 cycles of BKM120 treatment, a 45% reduction of the sum 
of the lesions was recorded. The TTP for this patient was [ADDRESS_1203666] patient was a 45 year-old man 
with grade 4 parotid gland ductal carcinoma, PI3KCA wild type, PTEN IHC positive. He had been 
previously treated with doxorubicin and adriamycin. After disease progression was observed on this regimen 
he was enrolled in the 100mg/day cohort (July 2010) in the [CBKM120X2101] study. At the first 
radiological assessment after receiving 2 cycles of BKM120 treatment, a 33% reduction of the sum of the 
lesions was recorded. The TTP for this patient was 16 weeks.
As of the data cut-off 04July2011, preliminary analysis shows forty-five percent of patients (30 of 66 
evaluable) had stable disease as best response, with 20 patients (30%) with a disease stabilization of 3 
months or longer. A trend towards better activity (long-term stabilizations) has been observed at the higher 
dose cohorts, also expressed in metabolic FDG-PET response. However, considering the impact of a PI3K
Protocol #: 14-008
Version # / Version Date: Version 5 / [ADDRESS_1203667] 2021
19inhibitor on glucose metabolism, further data needs to be acquired to understand whether the current FDG- 
PET assessment data can be used as a predictive factor for efficacy.
With regards to pharmacodynamic markers observed in study [CBKM120X2101], down regulation of pS6 
in skin by 30-80% was demonstrated in 28 out of the 38 evaluable patients at 100 and 150 mg/d and more 
than 25% FDG-PET signal decrease in patients at doses greater than the MTD.
With regards to the PI3K pathway activation, two of the three responders described above, one had a tumor 
with the PIK3CA mutation. Moreover, [ADDRESS_1203668] is warranted.
More specifically, in [CBKM120X2101], 25.3% (21/83) of patients had metastatic breast cancer. At the cut- 
off date of 4th July 2011, twenty breast cancer patients were evaluable for objective tumor response by 
[CONTACT_393] 1.0. Two breast cancer patients (11%), described above exhibited partial responses. For these 2 
patients, the treatment duration was 27+ (ongoing) and [ADDRESS_1203669] cancer 
patients (40%) had stable disease. Median progression-free survival was 60 days and the 6-month PFS rate 
was 33% (Rodon 2011).
Please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure for additional information on the available clinical experience 
with BKM120.
2.[ADDRESS_1203670] weekly 
cisplatin and radiotherapy in patients who are treated for locally advanced disease with curative intent.
We believe that weekly cisplatin dosing at 30mg/m2 is a reasonable standard as a starting dose since over 
the course of a 7 week chemoradiotherapy regimen, patients receive a total cumulative dose of 210mg/m2, 
similar to the two standard doses of bolus cisplatin 100mg/m2 each.
A retrospective study comparing chemoradiotherapy with bolus cisplatin (100mg/m2) versus weekly 
cisplatin (20mg/m2 weekly) failed to demonstrate significant differences in outcome (Kose et al 2011).
A prospective study similarly concluded that weekly cisplatin versus bolus cisplatin (100mg/m2 d 1, 22) 
was equally effective. The starting dose of 40mg/m2 had to be modified in many cases and the cut-off for 
successful treatment with cisplatin was a cumulative dose of 200mg/m2 or more (Homma et al 2011).
Even under the unlikely assumption that BKM120 is not active, the starting dose of cisplatin should provide 
sufficient radiosensitization compared to the standard of care.

of 3- 6 per dose level. Once the MTD is reached, an additional 10 patients will be treated at that dose level 
and an amendment will be submitted to OHRS to declare the dose.
5.3 Dose Escalation and Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_863249]-limiting toxicity (DLT), as defined in Section 5.5, will be the basis for determining the maximum 
tolerated dose (MTD). Any subject who receives at least one dose of the study drug (BKM120) will be 
included in analysis for DLT. Treatment cohorts will be dosed in escalating order, as outlined in Table 8, 
only after the safety of the previous dose level has been established, or until an MTD has been determined.
Subsequent dose levels will be opened for treatment as follows:
Protocol #: 14-008
Version # / Version Date: Version 5 / [ADDRESS_1203687] 2021
261) Escalation to the subsequent dose level will occur only after all subjects in the previous cohort 
have completed the full 7-week course of BKM120-CRT and have been evaluated for safety and toxicity. 
Safety will be evaluated based on the incidence of adverse events (AEs), physical exam findings, and clinical 
laboratory test results. A review of the safety data for each cohort will be conducted when all of the above 
data are available. In the event that an MTD is not reached after dose level 5, the study will be considered 
to have reached a biologically acceptable dose appropriate for Phase II study. Any further dose escalations 
or de-escalations will require a protocol amendment.
2) Three patients will initially be enrolled at dose level 1. The following rules apply for the 
advancement to the next dose level and to determine the MTD (see also Table 7). Enrollment may proceed 
at the higher dose according to the rules after three patients have been treated for the 2 weeks of BKM120 
followed by 7 weeks of BKM120+CRT at a given dose level and safety data have been reviewed. The dose 
will be increased until a DLT is observed in one subject. Dose limiting toxicity is graded according to the 
National Cancer Institute’s CTCAE v4.0 (http://ctep.cancer.gov/forms/CTCAEv4.pdf).
Once a DLT occurs, additional subjects will be added to the cohort until either a second subject experiences 
a DLT or six subjects are treated at that dose level. If no additional subject experiences a DLT at the trigger 
dose-level, further dose escalation as outlined in Table [ADDRESS_1203688] dose studied for which the incidence of DLT is less than 33%. 
The final cohort of three to six subjects may be expanded to 10 subjects to provide additional safety and 
pharmacokinetic data.
The decision to enroll subjects in the next higher dose level will be made at the discretion of the principal 
investigator.

After establishment of MTD, 10 additional patients will be enrolled at the MTD dose level to gain additional 
experience with this regimen and dose. If the MTD is not reached, because  1 DLT is encountered at dose 
level 6, ten additional patients will be enrolled at this dose level. If there are greater than 2 DLTs at dose 
level 1, enrollment will continue at dose level –[ADDRESS_1203692] be interrupted 
because of unacceptable toxicity, drug dosing will be interrupted or modified according to rules described 
in Table 9. Toxicity will be assessed using the NIH-NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events,

28otherwise specified (e.g., hyperglycemia). A dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as an adverse event or 
abnormal laboratory value assessed as unrelated to disease, disease progression, inter-current illness, or 
concomitant medications, and occurs < [ADDRESS_1203694] dose of BKM120, and meets any of the 
criteria listed in Table 9.
Whenever a patient experiences toxicity that fulfills the criteria for a DLT (or a potential DLT), treatment 
with BKM120 will be interrupted (if not otherwise specified) and the toxicity will be followed up as 
described in section 5.3. Exceptions are CTCAE grade 2 hyperglycemia and CTCAE grade 2 mood 
alteration, where BKM120 treatment will be continued under appropriate co-medication. The criteria for 
dose-limiting toxicities are outlined in Table 9.

5.8 Agent Administration
5.8.1 BKM120 Administration
The study drug BKM120 will be self-administered (by [CONTACT_36129]). The investigator will 
instruct the patient to take the study drug exactly as specified in the protocol. BKM120 will be 
administered on a continuous once daily dosing schedule. Patients should be instructed to take the dose of 
BKM120 daily in the morning, one hour after a light breakfast (morning meal) at approximately the same 
time each day. BKM120 should be taken with a glass of water and consumed over as short a time as 
possible. Patients should swallow the capsules as a whole and not chew them. Do not crush capsule. 
Patients should continue to fast for [ADDRESS_1203725] 4 hours following the 
previous day’s dosing must be noted whenever possible.
If the patient forgets to take her/his dose AFTER 6:[ADDRESS_1203726]. John’s Wort, Seville oranges, grapefruit or grapefruit juice, 
grapefruit hybrids, pummelos and exotic citrus fruits from [ADDRESS_1203727] avoid concomitant intake of strong and moderate CYP3A4/[ADDRESS_1203728] be 
recorded. If a patient requires a BKM120 dose delay of >14days from the previous dose, the patient must 
be discontinued from treatment but will only come off study if dead or due to refusal to continue on the 
study. Patients will only require a [ADDRESS_1203729] dose of BKM120.
Medication labels will comply with US legal requirements and be printed in English. They will supply no 
information about the patient. The storage conditions for study drug will be described on the medication 
label.
5.8.2 Cisplatin Treatment
Protocol #: 14-008
Version #/ Version Date: Version 5/ 15 July 2021
33Commercially available supplies of cisplatin will be used for this study. Preparation instructions can be 
found in the FDA approved package insert. Cisplatin will be administered per institutional guidelines.
Cisplatin injection is a sterile, aqueous solution, available in 50ml, 100ml, and 200ml, multiple dose vials, 
each ml containing 1mg of Cisplatin and 9mg sodium chloride in water for injection. HCI and/or sodium 
hydroxide added to adjust pH to 3.5 to 4.5.  It will be given intra-venously (IV) on days: (1, 8, 15, 22, 29,
36 and 43).
If radiation is held, BKM120 and cisplatin will be held as well. Additional weekly chemotherapy 
treatments may be added to the treatment course if chemo/XRT was held during the course of treatment. 
Cisplatin should be given only if at least 3 more days of radiotherapy treatment remain. Days of 
chemotherapy may be changed (+/-) 2 days if unforeseen circumstances require the timing of treatment. 
Treatment doses are based on body surface area (BSA). The actual body weight will be used for dose 
calculations as long as the BSA is below 2. For a BSA above 2, the BSA will be capped at 2.
Cisplatin is nephrotoxic and the patients will receive pre-and post treatment hydration according to 
institutional standards.
Institutional guidelines for highly emetogenic regimens will be followed. Patients will receive a 5HT 
antagonist for primary prevention of nausea and vomiting and will also receive [ADDRESS_1203730] and decadron per IV 
on day 2 and 3 after chemotherapy for delayed nausea at the discretion of the investigator. The concomitant 
use of aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_863250]120 is not allowed.
 Possible side effects of cisplatin are
oHematologic: Neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia
oGastrointestinal: Nausea, vomiting
oDermatologic: Alopecia
oRenal: Elevation of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and Creatinine, hypomagnesemia, 
hypokalemia, hypocalcemia
oNeurologic: Peripheral neuropathy, restlessness
oAllergic reactions
oOtotoxicity
Cisplatin is a commercially available product that is provided as part of standard of care.
5.9 Radiation
All patients will receive daily radiotherapy with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) delivered at 
DFCI. The prescribed dose will be 70 Gy (gray, SI unit of absorbed radiation) to the primary and nodal 
gross tumor volume, given in 2 Gy daily fractions for a total of 35 fractions. Other target volumes will be 
treated to 63 Gy and 56 Gy using differential dosing, as described below. There will be no planned cone 
downs or field changes. Treatment will be given 5 days per week for 7 weeks; treatment will not be 
planned to be delivered on Saturday, Sunday or major holidays, as per standard practice. Radiotherapy 
will be administered according to the general guidelines below.
Protocol #: 14-008
Version #/ Version Date: Version 5/ 15 July 2021
34 Volume Definitions-Volumes for all structures must be contoured on each relevant CT slice.
Gross tumor volume (GTV) consists of tumor at the primary site and gross nodal disease. The volumes 
will be defined based on imaging studies (CT and/or PET), in conjunction with information from clinical 
examination.
High risk clinical target volume (CTV1) includes volumes of potential tumor extension (adjacent to the 
primary or nodal GTV) and clinically/radiographically uninvolved nodal volumes at highest risk for 
microscopic involvement. The required anatomic margin around the GTV and gross nodal disease will 
be determined on a case-by-case basis by [CONTACT_174634], limited by [CONTACT_863287]. For gross nodal disease, CTV1 will include the nodal station where that node is located. In 
addition, the high risk clinical target volume may also include the complete anatomic nodal levels 
immediately adjacent to nodal regions that have gross disease.
Low risk clinical target volume (CTV2) includes lymph node regions at lesser risk for nodal 
involvement.
Planning target volume (PTV) incorporates a margin that accounts for daily set up variation. The 
planning target volume will be a 0.[ADDRESS_1203731] an individual PTV designed for set-up uncertainty.
 Avoidance Structures–The following normal tissue structures will be defined and delineated on 
all appropriate CT slices:
(a)Spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831], brainstem
(b)Expanded Spi[INVESTIGATOR_35406] ([ADDRESS_1203732])
(c)Right and left parotid glands
(d)Larynx
(e)Oral cavity
 Avoidance Structures–For cases in which the nasopharynx or base of skull is the primary target, 
the following avoidance structures will be added:
(a)Inner ear
(b)Optic nerves
(c)Optic chiasm
(d)Expanded optic nerve and chiasm (2 mm expansion around these structures)
(e)Eyes
(f)Brain
 Target Dose Prescriptions. The three target volumes are described in Section 5.8. All will be 
treated daily over the course of [ADDRESS_1203733] scan. Doses will be 
planned as follows:
Protocol #: 14-008
Version #/ Version Date: Version 5/ 15 July 2021
35(a)GTV will be treated to a total dose of 70 Gy in 2.0 Gy fractions.
(b)CTV1 will be treated to a total dose of 63 Gy in 1.8 Gy fractions.
(c)CTV2 will be treated to a total dose of 56 Gy in 1.6 Gy fractions.
 PTV coverage: No more than 20% of the PTV may receive > 110 % of the prescription dose. No 
more than 3% of the PTV may receive < 95% of the prescription dose. No more than 1cc of tissue outside 
the PTV may receive > 110% of the prescription dose.
 Normal Tissue Doses–The following normal tissue limits are recommended:
(a)Parotid Glands: Mean dose of 26 Gy or less.
(b)Larynx: Dose to the larynx should be limited to 50 Gy or less. For tumors in sites adjacent to the 
larynx, priority is given to tumor coverage. In those cases, at a minimum, an attempt will be made to 
minimize hot spots in the larynx.
(c)Oral Cavity: Volume receiving more than 50 Gy will be limited; constraints are similar to those noted 
above for larynx.
(d)Spi[INVESTIGATOR_35406]: No segment of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_863251] [ADDRESS_1203734] should be limited to 56 Gy for small volume.
(e)Mandible: Dose to any point should be less than 70 Gy.
(f)Inner Ear: Mean dose should be less than 34 Gy, and the maximum dose less than 47 Gy.
Note: In cases with a conflict/overlap between target and normal tissue, target dose considerations should 
take priority, at the discretion of the treating physician. An exception to this is the spi[INVESTIGATOR_863252], which takes priority.
 Treatment Breaks: There are no planned treatment breaks on this study; any breaks in planned 
radiotherapy are strongly discouraged. The Radiation Oncology Study Chair, Roy Tishler, will be 
contact[CONTACT_6811] [PHONE_17867] for interruptions greater than three treatment days. Radiotherapy interruptions 
will be permitted for unavoidable mechanical malfunction or serious illness requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], such 
as sepsis, delirium, severe respi[INVESTIGATOR_863253], at the discretion of the 
treating physician and Radiation Oncology Chair. Treatment breaks should be as short as possible. The 
reason for any interruption in treatment must be documented in the treatment chart.
 Simulation: At the time of radiation simulation all patients will have a thermoplastic mask fitted 
for immobilization. This mask will extend from the top of the skull to below the mid clavicle. Bite blocks, 
dental rolls and other set-up techniques may be used at the discretion of the treating radiation oncologist.
 Quality Assurance:
Prior to the first radiation treatment, the standard quality assurance procedures will be followed. The 
monitor units required to deliver the prescribed dose shall be calculated. The monitor units generated by 
[CONTACT_863288]’s first treatment. 
Measurements in a quality assurance phantom will be done for each patient that will be treated. In addition, 
film measurements will be taken during the QA period.
On the first day of treatment each patient will have electronic portal images taken, which will be approved 
by a radiation oncologist prior to delivery of the first treatment, per standard practice.
Weekly Verification portal images will be taken at least once per week and approved by a radiation

 Isodose Distribution: All plans will have complete documentation in the patient’s chart, 
including representative CT slices with treatment isodoses. A DVH with all relevant PTV and CTV 
structures and all normal tissue structures will be generated for each patient and documented in the 
patient’s radiotherapy chart.
 Treatment Equipment and Delivery: Treatment will be delivered on the Dana-Farber Varian 
Clinac 2100EX or Varian TX. 6 MV energy and dynamic multi-leaf collimators will be used to deliver all 
treatment.
5.10 General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines
All medications (excluding prior chemotherapy and biologic, immunologic or radiation therapy) taken 
within 4 weeks prior to the administration of BKM120 and all concomitant therapy administration during 
the study with reasons for therapy should be recorded. All prior chemotherapy; biologic, immunologic or 
radiation therapy; and surgery within [ADDRESS_1203736] the patient to notify the study site about any new medications he/she takes after the start

5.12.1 Laboratory evaluations
[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancy Test
A serum pregnancy test (β-HCG) is required for all women of child-bearing potential at screening, within 
[ADDRESS_1203739] dose of BKM120. Note: Postmenopausal women must have been amenorrheic 
for ≥ 12 months in order to be considered “of non-childbearing potential”. This should be documented 
appropriately in the patient’s medical history. Additional pregnancy tests should be performed as clinically 
indicated.
[IP_ADDRESS] Hematology
Hematology includes the following parameters: complete blood count (CBC) consisting of red blood cell 
(RBCs), a total white blood cell count (WBC) with differential (total neutrophil count including bands, 
lymphocyte, monocyte, eosinophil, and basophil counts); hemoglobin (Hgb); and platelet count.

findings) exam need only be performed if the urinalysis result is abnormal. This must be supplemented 
with laboratory quantification of any potentially relevant abnormalities.
5.12.2 Vital signs
Vital sign assessment consists of height (first visit), pulse, blood pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], temperature 
and weight. Blood pressure, pulse and respi[INVESTIGATOR_214773] [ADDRESS_1203740] comprise a total body examination (general 
appearance, skin, neck, including thyroid, eyes, ears, nose, throat, lungs, heart, abdomen, back, lymph 
nodes, extremities and basic nervous system).
Significant findings made after the start of study drug which meet the definition of an Adverse Event must 
be recorded.
5.12.4 Neuropsychiatric assessments
Patient self-rating mood questionnaires for anxiety and depression (PHQ-9, GAD-7).
Additional assessments may be done according to the clinical judgment of the Investigator. Symptomatic 
patients (≥ CTCAE grade 1) must continue with questionnaires on a weekly basis while active on the 
treatment portion of the study. Instructions on how to instruct the patient to complete the questionnaires 
as well as how to determine the scores will be provided together with each instrument.

http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/CTCAE_4.03_2010-06-14_QuickReference_8.5x11.pdf
Information about all adverse events, whether volunteered by [CONTACT_423], discovered by [CONTACT_70721], or detected through physical examination, laboratory test or other means, will be collected 
and recorded and followed as appropriate.
Protocol #: 14-008
Version #/ Version Date: Version 5/ 15 July 2021
39An adverse event is the appearance or worsening of any undesirable sign, symptom, or medical condition 
occurring after starting the study drug even if the event is not considered to be related to study drug. 
Medical conditions/diseases present before starting study drug are only considered adverse events if they 
worsen after starting study drug. Abnormal laboratory values or test results constitute adverse events only 
if they induce clinical signs or symptoms, are considered clinically significant, or require therapy.
The occurrence of adverse events should be sought by [CONTACT_105]-directive questioning of the patient at each 
visit during the study. Adverse events also may be detected when they are volunteered by [CONTACT_58862], laboratory test, or other assessments. As far as 
possible, each adverse event should be evaluated to determine:
1. the severity grade (mild, moderate, severe) or (grade 1-4)
2. its relationship to the study drug(s) (suspected/not suspected)
3. its duration (start and end dates or if continuing at final exam)
4. action taken (no action taken; study drug dosage adjusted/temporarily interrupted; study drug 
permanently discontinued due to this adverse event; concomitant medication taken; non-drug therapy 
given; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]/prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059])
5. whether it constitutes a serious adverse event (SAE)
All adverse events should be treated appropriately. Such treatment may include changes in study drug 
treatment including possible interruption or discontinuation, starting or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_058], 
changes in the frequency or nature of assessments, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or any other medically required 
intervention. Once an adverse event is detected, it should be followed until its resolution, and assessment 
should be made at each visit (or more frequently, if necessary) of any changes in severity, the suspected 
relationship to the study drug, the interventions required to treat it, and the outcome.
Information about common side effects already known about the investigational drug can be found in the 
[Investigators’ Brochure]. This information should be included in the patient informed consent and should 
be discussed with the patient during the study as needed.
5.12.12 Serious adverse events
An adverse event is considered serious if it results in ANY of the following outcomes:
1)Death
2)A life-threatening adverse event
3)An adverse event results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15163] ≥ 24 hours
4)A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal 
life functions
5)A congenital anomaly/birth defect.
6)Important Medical Events (IME) that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon medical judgment, they may 
jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one

40All events reported to the FDA by [CONTACT_109] 3500A 
(MedWatch Form).
All events must be reported, by [CONTACT_46465] ([PHONE_002]), to [COMPANY_001] Pharmaceuticals DS&E 
Department within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence. This includes serious, related, labeled 
(expected) and serious, related, unlabeled (unexpected) adverse experiences. All deaths during treatment 
or within [ADDRESS_1203744] medical treatment given to a patient (e.g. treatment withdrawal during 
washout period, change in treatment to a fixed dose of concomitant medication).
Serious adverse events occurring more than 4 weeks after study discontinuation need only be reported if 
a relationship to the [COMPANY_001] study drug (or therapy) is suspected.
For Comparator Drugs/Secondary Suspects (Concomitant Medications), all serious adverse experiences 
will be forwarded to the product manufacturer by [CONTACT_093].
5.12.[ADDRESS_1203745] be reported to [COMPANY_001] 
within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence. The pregnancy should be followed up for 3 months after the 
termination of the pregnancy to determine outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary termination, 
details of the birth, and the presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal 
and/or newborn complications.
Pregnancy should be recorded on a Clinical Study Pregnancy Form and reported by [CONTACT_110][INVESTIGATOR_623] (DS&E) department. Pregnancy follow-up should be 
recorded on the same form and should include an assessment of the possible relationship to the [COMPANY_001] 
study treatment of any pregnancy outcome. Any SAE experienced during pregnancy must be reported on 
the SAE Report Form.
Pregnancy outcomes must be collected for the female partners of any males who took study treatment in 
this study. Consent to report information regarding these pregnancy outcomes should be obtained from 
the mother.
Information for female partners of male study participants
Your male partner is offered to participate in a clinical research study. As a prerequisite to participate in 
this study your partner must agree to use a condom during intercourse. This is important because test 
results of the study treatment in pregnant animals indicated that the medicine can harm an unborn baby 
[CONTACT_863289]. At the same time it is also important that you do not become pregnant while your 
partner is taking the medication. Therefore, you should use a highly effective method of birth control 
(contraception) during the time your male partner receives the study treatment and thereafter for another 
[ADDRESS_1203746] less than 
1% of unwanted pregnancy during one year, if used appropriately according to the instructions of the 
manufacturer.
Those methods are the following (a+b):
a) Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS)
Protocol #: 14-008
Version #/ Version Date: Version 5/ 15 July 2021
41b) Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) 
with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository
 Oral contraception, injected or implanted hormonal methods are not allowed as BKM120 
potentially decreases the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives.
 Fertile males, defined as all males physiologically capable of conceiving offspring must 
use condom during treatment, for 4 weeks (5 T1/2) after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_863248] 12 
weeks (16 weeks in total after study drug discontinuation) and should not father a child in this period.
 Female partner of male study subject should use highly effective contraception during dosing 
of any study agent and for [ADDRESS_1203747] information about you, 
your pregnancy and your child.
5.13 Duration of Follow Up
Follow up (FU) for adverse events will take place every 2 weeks after conclusion of BKM120+CRT (EOT) 
during the first month, then monthly for [ADDRESS_1203748]. See Study Calendar for full details.
5.14 Criteria for Removal from Study Treatment and/or Study Itself
For patients who are unable to tolerate the protocol-specified dosing schedule, dose adjustments are 
permitted in order to keep the patient on study drug. If administration of BKM120 must be 
interrupted because of unacceptable toxicity, drug dosing will be interrupted or modified according 
to rules described in Table 11. Toxicity will be assessed using the NIH-NCI Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0.
http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/CTCAE_4.03_2010-06-14_QuickReference_8.5x11.pdf
The reason for study treatment discontinuation and/or study removal and the date the participant was 
removed must be documented in the case report form (CRF). Alternative care options will be discussed 
with the participant.
Reasons that a patient may discontinue study treatment and/or discontinue participation in a clinical study 
are considered to constitute one of the following:
1. adverse event(s)
2. abnormal laboratory value(s)
3. abnormal test procedure result(s)
Protocol #: 14-008
Version #/ Version Date: Version 5/ [ADDRESS_1203749] Treatment Ended/Off Study Form should be filled out when a participant completes study 
treatment and again when the participant comes off study. This form can be found on the QACT website 
or obtained from the QACT registration staff.
In the event of unusual or life-threatening complications, investigators must immediately notify the 
Overall PI, Glenn Hanna, MD at [PHONE_17868] or page at [PHONE_17869].

discretion.
-Nephrotoxicity: If, despi[INVESTIGATOR_179090], serum creatinine increases to > grade 1 (≥ 1.[ADDRESS_1203777]), 
creatinine clearance should be recalculated before the next cisplatin dose and subsequent dose reductions 
will be recommended as follows:

* Creatinine clearance as calculated by [CONTACT_863291]-Gault equation.
** Percent dose reduction is calculated from the original dose, not the previous dose. If creatinine 
clearance recovers, the dose of cisplatin should be re-escalated to the patient’s previous dose level as is 
outlined in the Dose Modification of Cisplatin in Kidney Impairment chart above. There is no maximum 
limit.
Serum creatinine will be measured weekly within 24 hours of cisplatin dosing.

7. ADVERSE EVENTS: LIST AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS
Adverse event (AE) monitoring and reporting is a routine part of every clinical trial. The following list 
of reported and/or potential AEs (Section 7.1) and the characteristics of an observed AE (Section 7.2) will 
determine whether the event requires expedited reporting in addition to routine reporting.
7.1 Expected Toxicities
7.1.1 Known Undesirable Side Effects of BKM120
[IP_ADDRESS] Neuropsychiatric events
In an ongoing Phase Ia study of BKM120 in patients with solid tumors (CBKM120X2101), neuro- 
psychiatric adverse events, including reversible and generally mild to moderate mood alterations, 
described as anxiety, agitation with crying epi[INVESTIGATOR_863255]120. In this study, three out of five patients with moderate to severe mood alterations had a 
history of depression and/or anxiety. All patients with a documented medical history of depression/anxiety 
also developed mood alterations while treated with BKM120 at the 100 mg dose level and thus reflecting 
a potential risk group of patients.
In order to lower the risk of experiencing significant mood alterations within the proposed study, cancer 
patients with an active or history of major depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive

by [CONTACT_1755]/or based on recent psychiatric assessment will not qualify for study participation. 
Patients with corresponding symptoms CTCAE Grade ≥ [ADDRESS_1203778] and closely followed medically. Medical treatment with mood stabilizers such as SSRIs 
(sertaline/fluoxetine) may be prescribed as per investigator’s discretion and following consultation of a 
psychiatrist.
Results of the questionnaire will also be reported in the final manuscript as part of toxicity reporting, using 
descriptive statistics.
[IP_ADDRESS] Management of mood alteration
Patient self-rating mood questionnaires PHQ-9 (depression) and GAD-7 (anxiety) will be used:
• to support assessment of eligibility at Screening
• to monitor for newly occurring or worsening mood alterations during the study. 
The following grading system will be used for this study:

[IP_ADDRESS] Hyperglycemia
In preclinical studies, insulin/glucose homeostasis was impacted in various species (mice, rats, dogs), as 
expected from the mode of action of BKM120. In both rats and dogs, at the doses used in the 4-week 
studies, these effects were minimal. However, in mice treated at high doses (30 or 60 mg/kg/day) a clear 
induction of insulin resistance/insensitivity was observed, without clear influence of the dose or the time 
point of testing. Histopathologically, pancreas and liver showed changes which are in concordance with 
this activity.
Grade 4 Hyperglycemia was also observed in an ongoing Phase Ia study of BKM120 in patients with solid 
tumors (CBKM120X2101). Therefore, no patients with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus will be enrolled in 
this study. In all patients, fasting plasma glucose will obtained at screening and will be monitored 
throughout the trial. For the treatment of glucose disturbances occurring under BKM120 treatment 
investigators are advised to adhere to the protocol guidelines outlined in Table 11.
[IP_ADDRESS] Management of Hyperglycemia
In addition to the dose modification and hyperglycemia treatment guidelines in Table 5.
Under the supervision of an endocrinologist, an insulin regimen should be initiated according to 
institutional standard of care or the Treat-To-Target Algorithm for Lantus® (Riddle, Rosenstock, and 
Gerich 2003).
• For any hyperglycemia ≥ grade 1, the patient should continue to follow dietary guidelines provided by 
[CONTACT_11026] (American Diabetes Association 2004).
• For each patient, a maximum of [ADDRESS_1203782] discontinue treatment with BKM120, if after 
treatment is resumed at a lower dose, hyperglycemia recurs at a worse severity.
• For each patient, once a dose level reduction has occurred, the dose level may not be re-escalated in that 
patient during future treatment with BKM120.
• Based upon the results of preliminary clinical data and actual laboratory values (e.g., glucose, insulin) 
generated, the treatment recommendations for study drug induced hyperglycemia may be modified as 
needed.
[IP_ADDRESS] Cardiac events
Cardiac safety studies, conducted in vitro and in vivo, did not indicate a prominent electrophysiological 
risk. The only effect considered relevant was a trend towards an increase in systolic and diastolic blood 
pressure, observed in two dog telemetry studies. As a precaution in the first-in man study with BKM120 
no patients with a severe or unstable cardiac disease or cardiac disease requiring continuous treatment, 
and no patients with uncontrolled hypertension will be enrolled in early clinical studies. In addition, all 
patients will be assessed for cardiac diseases before start of treatment, while all patients enrolled in the 
trial will undergo regular cardiac monitoring throughout the conduct of the trial. For the treatment of acute
Protocol #: 14-008
Version #/ Version Date: Version 5/ 15 July 2021
54cardiac events occurring under BKM120 treatment investigators are advised to adhere to the protocol 
guidelines. Vital signs, including pulse rate and blood pressure, will closely be followed during the early 
clinical studies.
[IP_ADDRESS] Management of Cardiac events
At the screening visit a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), and an echocardiogram or MUGA 
(ECHO/MUGA) will be performed to assess eligibility. Repeat ECGs will be performed at screening and 
as clinically indicated. An ECHO/MUGA will be repeated at Day 1 of CRT and EOT.
[IP_ADDRESS] Management of Pneumonitis
Pneumonitis is a known side effect of rapamycin analogues. Based on the literature, the class of PI3K 
inhibitors has not previously been associated with the development of Pneumonitis. Clinically significant 
Pneumonitis is typi[INVESTIGATOR_863256]-specific symptoms including dyspnea, nonproductive 
cough, fatigue, and fever. Diagnosis is generally suspected in individuals who develop these symptoms or 
in asymptomatic individuals in whom a routine chest CT scan reveals a new ground glass or alveolar 
infiltrate.
In ongoing clinical trials with BKM120 in the single agent setting two cases of Pneumonitis occurred. In 
the study BKM120X2101 one patient experienced Pneumonits grade [ADDRESS_1203783] dose of 
BKM120 at 100mg which resolved in 7 days after antibiotic therapy and discontinuation of the study 
treatment due to fatigue. In the Japanese study BKM120X1101 one case of Pneumonitis occurred in a 
patient given 100 mg one month after the start of study medication with BKM120. The patient experienced 
Pneumonitis with fatal outcome which was concomitant to progression of underlying malignancy 
including the progression of existing and the appearance of new lesions in combination with increasing 
pleural effusion (please see current IB for more details).
All patients participating in clinical trials administering BKM120 will be routinely asked about the 
occurrence of adverse events which could include new or changed pulmonary symptoms (consistent with 
lung abnormalities). CT scans and pulmonary function test should be done, as clinically indicated, or if 
there are symptoms that indicate that the patient has developed Pneumonitis. In case of a documented 
Pneumonitis, the guidelines (including dose modifications) in Table [ADDRESS_1203784] is highly recommended for any Pneumonitis case identified during the study.

- Possible – The AE may be related to the study treatment.
- Unlikely – The AE is doubtfully related to the study treatment.
- Unrelated – The AE is clearly NOT related to the study treatment.
7.3 For expedited reporting purposes only:
- AEs for the agent that is listed above should be reported only if the adverse event varies in 
nature, intensity or frequency from the expected toxicity information which is provided.
- Other AEs for the protocol that do not require expedited reporting are outlined in the next 
section (Expedited Adverse Event Reporting) under the sub-heading of Protocol-Specific Expedited 
Adverse Event Reporting Exclusions.
7.4 Expedited Reporting to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
The Overall PI, as study sponsor, will be responsible for all communications with the FDA. The Overall 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_57895], regardless of the site of occurrence, any serious adverse event that meets the 
FDA’s criteria for expedited reporting following the reporting requirements and timelines set by [CONTACT_1622].

have the same qualitative composition, although they are not proportionally scaled. The capsules consist of 
dry powder blends made using standard excipi[INVESTIGATOR_863258]: mannitol, microcrystalline 
cellulose, crospovidone, colloidal silicon dioxide, and magnesium stearate. The 10-mg capsule uses a Size 
1 or Size 3 pi[INVESTIGATOR_863259], the 50 mg capsules uses a Size 1 capsule shell of pi[INVESTIGATOR_863260].
8.1.2 Storage and Stability
Based on the available stability data, BKM120 capsules are not to be stored above 25°C.
The capsules are packaged in high density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles with induction seals and child 
resistant caps.
The shelf-life period and storage conditions will be continually assessed based on accelerated and long 
term stability data.
8.1.3 Handling
Qualified personnel, familiar with procedures that minimize undue exposure to themselves and the 
environment, should undertake the preparation, handling, and safe disposal of the chemotherapeutic agent 
in a self-contained and protective environment.
8.1.4 Ordering

Drug Accountability and Storage.)
8.1.[ADDRESS_1203795] pre-treatment tumor tissue collected (fresh or archival) and NexGen sequencing will 
be performed to assess the mutational landscape in these cases. This will include over [ADDRESS_1203796] Institute/MIT, Cambridge, MA. In this assay, tyrosine kinases 
will be isolated from fresh tumor tissue and phosphorylation status will be assessed in a panel of [ADDRESS_1203797] approximately 30% of patients to be eligible and amenable to sequential biopsies.
The correlative studies to investigate the influence of the NFE2L2/KEAP1/CUL3 pathway, are outlined 
in the attached research proposal (Appendix D), for which we will receive support through an internal 
DFCI grant mechanism.
9.2  ImmunoProfile 
In addition to the correlative laboratory studies explained in the section above, the investigators may 
choose to use an additional tissue testing methodology known as ImmunoProfile.  
ImmunoProfile uses multiplex immunofluorescent staining and imaging. Multiplex technology uses 
multiple colors to identify different cells and proteins at the same time on the same slide. Once multiplex 
staining is complete, the Vectra imager is used to acquire an image of the slide/staining for analysis. Image 
analysis software is then used to determine the number and percentage of cells positive for the selected 
immuno-regulatory proteins. 
The current version of ImmunoProfile tests for 5 different proteins/markers on one slide (i.e., DAPI, a 
tumor marker, PDL1, CD8, PD-1 and FOXP3). These initial proteins have been selected because they are 
targets for existing immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_863261].

Version #/ Version Date: Version 5/ [ADDRESS_1203798] and the study results are not released to patient electronic medical records as of the 
writing of this document. 
Detailed Material and Methods 
Staining is performed overnight for ~9 hours on BOND RX fully automated stainers (Leica Biosystems). 
Tissue sections of 5-μm thick FFPE are baked for 3 hours at 60°C before loading into the BOND RX. 
Slides are deparaffinized (BOND DeWax Solution, Leica Biosystems, Cat. AR9590) and rehydrated with 
series of graded ethanol to deionized water. Antigen retrieval is performed in BOND Epi[INVESTIGATOR_863262] 1 (pH 6) or 2 (pH 9), as shown below (ER1, ER2, Leica Biosystems, Cat. AR9961, AR9640) at 
95°C. Deparaffinization, rehydration and antigen retrieval are all pre-programmed and executed by [CONTACT_863294]. Next, slides are serially stained with primary antibodies, such as anti-CD8 (clone 4B11; Leica, 
dilution 1:200). Incubation time per primary antibody was 30 minutes. Subsequently, anti-mouse plus 
anti-rabbit Opal Polymer Horseradish Peroxidase (Opal Polymer HRP Ms + Rb, Akoya Biosciences, Cat. 
ARH1001EA) is applied as a secondary label with an incubation time of 10 minutes. Signal for antibody 
complexes is labeled and visualized by [CONTACT_863295] (Akoya) by 
[CONTACT_863296] 10 minutes. Slides are incubated in Spectral DAPI [INVESTIGATOR_517963] (Akoya) for 10 
minutes, air dried, and mounted with Prolong Diamond Anti-fade mounting medium (Life Technologies, 
Cat. P36965) and stored in a light-proof box at 4 ̊C prior to imaging. The target antigens, antibody clones, 
dilutions for markers, and antigen retrieval details are listed in Table 16. 
Image acquisition is performed using the Vectra Polaris multispectral imaging platform (Vectra Polaris, 
Akoya Biosciences, Marlborough, MA). Areas with non-tumor or residual normal tissue (i.e. residual 
lymph node) are excluded from the analysis. Representative regions of interest are chosen by [CONTACT_352091], and 3-5 fields of view (FOVs) are acquired at 20x resolution as multispectral images. Cell 
identification is performed as described previously (Carey et al, Blood 2016). In short, after image capture, 
the FOVs are spectrally unmixed and then analyzed using supervised machine learning algorithms within 
Inform 2.4 (Akoya). This image analysis software assigns phenotypes to all cells in the image, based on a 
combination of immunofluorescence characteristics associated with segmented nuclei (DAPI [CONTACT_266309]). 
Each cell-phenotype specific algorithm is based upon an iterative training / test process, whereby a small 
number of cells (training phase, typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 15-20 cells) are manually selected as being most representative 
of each phenotype of interest and the algorithm then predicts the phenotype for all remaining cells (testing 
phase). The pathologist can over-rule the decisions made by [CONTACT_863297], until 
phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_863263]. Thresholds for "positive" staining and the accuracy of phenotypic algorithms 
are optimized and confirmed by [CONTACT_863298].

Version #/ Version Date: Version 5/ 15 July 2021
6312.2 Data Safety Monitoring
The DF/HCC Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will review and monitor toxicity and 
accrual data from this study. The committee is composed of clinical specialists with experience in 
oncology and who have no direct relationship with the study. Information that raises any questions about 
participant safety will be addressed with the Overall PI [INVESTIGATOR_36749].
The DSMC will review each protocol up to four times a year or more often if required to review toxicity 
and accrual data. Information to be provided to the committee may include: up-to-date participant accrual; 
current dose level information; DLT information; all grade [ADDRESS_1203811] been reported; summary of all deaths occurring with 30 days of intervention for Phase I or II 
protocols; for gene therapy protocols, summary of all deaths while being treated and during active follow- 
up; any response information; audit results, and a summary provided by [CONTACT_3476]. Other information 
(e.g. scans, laboratory values) will be provided upon request.
13. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
This trial follows a standard 3+3 phase I design. The primary endpoint is to determine the MTD. Patients 
will be started at a given dose and escalated according to the information outlined in section 5.3.
The table below gives the probabilities of the dose escalation scheme outlined in section 5.3.
True Rate of DLT Probability of Escalation
20% .71
30% .49
40% .31
50% .17
60% .08
For example, if the true rate of DLT is 20% at a given dose, there is a 71% probability of escalating to a 
higher dose.
At most, 46 patients are estimated to be accrued. This is based on studying 6 levels of BKM120+Cisplatin 
(section 5.3) with at most 6 patients per level plus an additional 10 at the MTD (these 10 accrued to ensure 
that the adverse event rate at the MTD is acceptable). The estimation of adverse events will be based on 
studying these 10 additional patients. The width of the 90% confidence interval for the estimation of the 
adverse event rate will be no more than 56%. The monthly accrual rate is estimated to be 2 to 3 patients.
For secondary objectives: best overall response rate will be summarized as a proportion with a corresponding 90% 
exact confidence interval, the distributions of progression and survival will be estimated using a Kaplan-Meier 
method with corresponding 90% confidence intervals for the median or time-specific event time, scores from the 
GAD-7 and the PHQ-9 to assess mood will be summarized across the timepoints of assessment. Several correlative 
studies are planned to learn more about how BKM120 blocks PIK. NexGen sequencing of the specimens and studies 
to investigate the influence of the NFE2L2/KEAP1/CUL3 are planned (see sections 9.1 and Appendix D). Given 
the small sample size of this trial, these studies are exploratory.

68APPENDIX B: DRUGS THAT ARE PROHIBITED
Other investigational therapi[INVESTIGATOR_201714].
Anticancer therapy (chemotherapy, biologic or radiation therapy, and surgery) other than the study 
treatments must not be given to patients while the patient is on the study. If such agents are required for a 
patient then the patient must be discontinued from the study.
In vitro metabolism studies suggest that oxidative metabolism of BKM120 is predominantly mediated 
by [CONTACT_097]3A4 (fm>0.9), with only minor contributions of CYP1A1. As BKM120 is a sensitive CYP3A4 
substrate, co-administration of BKM120 with strong and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors and CYP3A4 
inducers is prohibited. See below for a list of prohibited drugs. Please note this list may not be 
comprehensive.
Based on in vitro studies, co-administration of BKM120 with CYP3A4 inducers is predicted to 
decrease the systemic exposure to BKM120, thereby [CONTACT_863300]. See below for a list of prohibited CYP3A inducers. Please note that this list 
may not be comprehensive. Therapeutic doses of warfarin sodium (Coumadin®) or any other coumadin- 
derivative anticoagulants are not permitted.
If a patient requires the concomitant use of any medication included in Table 18 below entitled “List 
of Prohibited QT prolonging drugs” (i.e., drugs that are generally accepted by [CONTACT_236054].org Advisory 
Board of the Arizona CERT to have a risk of causing Torsades des de Pointes), study treatment 
administration must be interrupted as long as the patient requires therapy with the QT prolonging agent.
Herbal preparations/medications are not allowed throughout the study. These herbal medications 
include, but are not limited to St. John’s wort, Kava, ephedra (ma huang), ginko biloba, 
dehydroepi[INVESTIGATOR_2119] (DHEA), yohimbe, saw palmetto, ginsing. Patients should stop using these herbal 
medications [ADDRESS_1203813] dose of study drug.
Hormonal contraceptives may be affected by [CONTACT_9058] P450 interactions, and are therefore not 
considered effective in this study.

(*) Classification according to the Qtdrugs.org Advisory Board of the Arizona CERT
Sensitive substrates: Drugs whose plasma AUC values have been shown to increase 5-fold or higher 
when co-administered with a potent inhibitor of the respective enzyme.
Drugs to be used with caution
Preliminary in vitro metabolism studies suggest that BKM120 is a weak, reversible inhibitor CYP3A4/5 
(Ki=13.6 μM, [I]/Ki= 0.4 where [I] is the average C max at steady-state following 100 mg daily dose) and 
a weak reversible inhibitor of CYP2C8/2C9/2C19 (IC 50=34 μM, [I]/IC 50=0.15). Note: that with the data 
available, we are not able to confirm whether such interactions will occur in patients. Therefore, 
investigators, at their discretion, may administer concomitant medications known to be metabolized by 
[CONTACT_097]3A4/5, CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. Patients receiving such medications must be carefully 
monitored for potentiation of toxicity due to any individual concomitant medications, and may require 
dose titration or reduction of the drug substrate. Please refer to Table [ADDRESS_1203814] of CYP450 substrates 
and carefully consider their co-administration with BKM120.
Particularly, caution is advised when BKM120 is co-administered with:
Protocol #: 14-008
Version #/ Version Date: Version 5/ 15 July 2021
71Drugs which are substrates for CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2C9 or CYP2C19 and which have a narrow 
therapeutic index.
Oral anti-diabetics which are metabolized by [CONTACT_097]2C8 or CYP2C9 can possibly result in 
hypoglycemia. Patients who develop diabetes mellitus during the study should be treated according to the 
American Diabetes Association guidance. It is recommended that treatment start with metformin.
If a patient, after study enrollment, requires the concomitant use of any QT prolonging medication 
with a possible or conditional risk for torsade de pointes then the investigators, at their discretion, may co- 
administer such medications. Patients receiving such medications must be monitored. Refer to Table [ADDRESS_1203815] of QT prolonging medications to be used with caution.
Note: please refer also to Table [ADDRESS_1203816] of prohibited QT prolonging medication.
Please refer to Table [ADDRESS_1203817] of CYP450 substrates and carefully consider their co-administration 
with BKM120.
Concomitant treatment with corticosteroids and BKM120 should be avoided, whenever possible, 
during this study. A short duration (< 2 weeks) of systemic corticosteriods is allowed (e.g. for chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease, or as an anti-emetic). Chronic dosing of corticosteriods is known to induce 
CYP3A enzymes, thereby [CONTACT_863301]120 overall exposure to sub-therapeutic 
levels.

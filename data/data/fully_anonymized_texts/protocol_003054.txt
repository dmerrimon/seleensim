2. Introduction  
a. Background and rationale Research suggests that acidic pH and nasal viral load 
contribute to replication and disease severity of COVID -19. We plan to test salin e nasal 
irrigation of 240cc with either a lkalinized nasal saline or 0.1%  virucidal povidone -iodine 
twice daily in participants recently testing positive for SARS -CoV-2. We hypothesize that 
nasal irrigation debridement with ei ther the basic or virucidal intervention will be 
correlated with reduced COVID -19 progression to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and reduction in 
symptom severity, supportive oxygen, and death in COVID -19 positive patients 55 years 
of age and older.  
4 
 b. Objectives - To determ ine if twice -daily saline nasal irrigations with either 0.1% povidone -
iodine or 2.5 mL  of baking soda in one of two over -the-counter irrigation devices in 
patients tested positive for COVID -19 improves clinical outcomes:  
i. Primary Outcome : To assess reductio n in COVID -19-related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_639414] a national dataset . 
ii. Secondary Outcomes :  
1. Assess reduction in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6042], symptoms, admission, supplemental 
oxygen use, ICU admission, and death in patients with alkalinization or 
virucidal a dditives to nasal irrigation.   
2. Evaluate impact of nasal irrigation compared to published historical 
reports and meta -analyses of outcomes in similar patient groups 
including household spread.  
3. Evaluate impact of race, days of symptoms, and pre -existing cond itions 
on utility of nasal irrigation to reduce adverse outcomes of any kind.  
3. Study Methods  
a. Trial design - a consecutive prospective, randomized parallel group trial to evaluate the 
efficacy of either alkalinization or povidone -iodine  twice daily nasal irr igation initiated on 
the day of positive test notification  for reduction of COVID -19 symptoms and disease 
progression to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_30059] . The enrolled participants were also compared to 
a national dataset as a nested case -cohort.  
b. Randomization - Block randomization to the twice daily irrigation with alkalinization or 
povidone -iodine was done by [CONTACT_639460] (random.org) stratified by [CONTACT_4321]. 
With odd numbers signifying alkaline and even povidone -iodine, numbered opaque 
envelopes were prepar ed in separate sequences for male or female participants to be 
opened after consent, indicating the appropriate additive to be given to the patient. The 
list of positives for the day from the lab were called in sequential order to obtain a 
consecutive samp le that met all inclusion criteria and did not meet any exclusion criteria. 
On days with potential participant volume exceeding 10, the call order was randomized 
by [CONTACT_639460].  
c. Sample Size - We assumed a baseline admission rate of 25%, with a small to moderate 
impact of the additive to the irrigant (Cohen’s d=3). To reduce hospi[INVESTIGATOR_639415] 10%, 
100 patients per group would be required for 80% power. Initial assumptions by [CONTACT_639461] u nit would be variables, 
thus the IRB approved protocol was for 400 patients. Published support that any 
pressurized unit was sufficient reduced the target enrollment to 200.  
After determining a zero hospi[INVESTIGATOR_639416], the trial’s revi sed target 
enrollment was 79 irrigation participants with 158 matched controls. Assuming that 25% 
of the matched control participants and 10% of the treatment participants would visit the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (60% reduction), [ADDRESS_855326] .80 
(80%) power to detect that proportional difference. Power was calculated two ways, by 
[CONTACT_56047] a simulation comparing the likelihood of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and using a z -test 
comparing independent proportions. Both analyses assumed reduc ed variation in 
proportions due to accounting for the correlates of testing time, age, sex, and race, and 
5 
 resulted in similar calculations. The inability to evaluate and match underlying conditions 
in the control group could increase variability, thus a 1: [ADDRESS_855327] a full analysis a new power analysis was conducted, 
leading to the decision to enroll up to a target of 79 patients with 1:[ADDRESS_855328] 
accessed 8/20/2021.  
g. Time points at which outcomes were measured:  Primary ou tcomes were  measured [ADDRESS_855329] 14 days. Subjects were  called on Day 2, 7, 14, and 28 to check on 
current symptoms and outcomes.  
4. Statistical Principles  
a. Confi dence Intervals and P Values: alpha will be 0.05 and 95% confidence intervals will 
be reported for relative risk. Standard Error will be reported for exact binomial tests.  
b. Adherence and protocol deviations:  Symptom outcomes will be reported for patients 
completing the daily symptom diary. Adherence to irrigation was recorded in daily online 
surveys, and confirmed with uploaded photographs of used saline packets or pods, or 
phone calls for patients unable to upload photographs.  
c. Analysis populations:  The pri mary outcomes of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_639417].  Adherence, symptom, and household spread will be reported for 
patients filling out a minimum of two daily surveys, and all completing initial survey.  
5. Trial Population  
a. Screening Data:  We will report the number of patients with positive tests, the number 
reached, the number screened and reasons for non -enrollment.  
b. Eligibility:   
i. Inclusion Criteria  - Capable of understanding and providing informed consent 
using remote consent ; Willin gness and physical capacity to initiate nasal

6. Analysis  
a. Outcome Definitions  –  
i. Primary Outcome : hospi[INVESTIGATOR_639418] -19 within 28 days of 
enrollment – Obtained by [CONTACT_6270] -report, report of family member, and confirmed 
by [CONTACT_14716]. For the purposes of the study, COVID -19 related chief 
complaints will include any of the top five sympt oms associated with emergency 
department presentation: Cough, Fever (subjective or >100.4°F/38°C), Myalgia, 
Headache, or Dyspnea. Other ED presentations resulting in discharge without 
subsequent admission will not meet the criteria of morbidity severity re lated to 
this study. In cases where patients are admitted, discharge diagnosis or cause or 
contributing cause of death will be considered for categorization of COVID -
related or not -COVID related. In cases where potential for COVID -19 related 
admission or d eath is ambiguous, a member of the research team (MD) blinded 
to group will be asked to assess the information gathered from the chart and 
make a determination of COVID or non -COVID related.  
ii. Secondary Outcomes – Obtained by [CONTACT_639463], in addition to c onfirmatory 
phone call information collected day 2,7,14, and 28.   
1. Duration of COVID -19 symptoms (loss of smell, fatigue, presence or 
absence of fever >100.4, subjective fever, chills, muscle aches, runny 
nose, cough (new onset or worsening of chronic cough ), shortness of 
breath, nausea or vomiting, headache, loss of smell, abdominal pain, 
diarrhea (>3 loose/looser than normal stools/24 hours)  
7 
 2. Confirmed or symptomatic household members with new cases after 
initiation of daily surveys  
3. COVID -19 related ED visits, supplemental oxygen use, ICU admission  
4. Dose -response of daily irrigation related to symptoms  
5. Adverse events related to irrigation,  including discomfort not leading to 
or leading to  discontinuation and reason  
b. Analysis method s –  
i. Primary Outcome -To compare observed hospi[INVESTIGATOR_639419] (admission or 
death) published by [CONTACT_29510], the binomial test was used. As it is an exact test, 
Clopper -Pearson confidence intervals were used giving a SE and P value. 
Relative risks were calculated for bad outcomes compared to the total number 
of cases, and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_639420]. Chi 
squares were calculated for differences between demographics in the enrolled 
group and the national dataset.  Deaths in patients for whom hospi[INVESTIGATOR_639421] . 
ii. Differences  by [CONTACT_639464]. Prior to combining the randomized groups to 
compare with the national dataset, the plan was as follows: t o examine sex and 
racial differences on the dependent variables, t-tests will be used unless non -
normal distribution is noted, in which case Mann Whitney U will be used. 
Baseline measures of duration, pre -existing conditions, and symptoms will be 
compared across the conditions to ensure that the randomization process was 
effective. Analyses of compliance by [CONTACT_639465]. If any of these analyses result in significant findings, 
they will be considered as covariates in subsequent analyses. To test the effect 
of treatme nt group in disease severity, Kaplan -Meier survival plots will be 
calculated . Pearson’s correlation coefficient will assess if an inverse linear 
relationship exists between number of irrigation uses and illness severity 
outcomes.  
c. Missing Data  – Only laboratory confirmed cases were used. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_639422] 43% of laboratory -confirmed CDC case records  in correlating  age 
range s and the same enrollment  time period. To avoid overestimating by [CONTACT_639466], 
we calculated the admission rate retaining all laboratory -confirmed cases in the 
denominator, includ ing when hospi[INVESTIGATOR_639423].  
(Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_639424])   
______________________________________________________  
(Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_639425] + No + Unknown + Missing)  
 
Because there were no deaths in our sample, we could not cal culate a comparative rate 
with the national database. To capture the burden of mortality  which likely was or 
should have been preceded by [CONTACT_2360][INVESTIGATOR_059] , we included deaths as an additional 
measure of severity only when hospi[INVESTIGATOR_639426]. Thus, the rate 
of deaths is under -estimated.

Deaths reported

We did not include deaths in cases where hospi[INVESTIGATOR_639429]. Thus the comparison rate  used 
for binomial testing  was:  
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] + Death when hospi[INVESTIGATOR_639430]  
(Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_639431] + No + Unknown + Missing)

 Appendix 1: Final Full Recruitment Methods  and Demographics  
Recruitment   
There will be two groups of participants: an active (exposed to intervention) group and a 
passive control group. The passive “nonexposed” control group (not interested in enrolling 
or not able to be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] ) will be people  [ADDRESS_855332] will be called by a 
member of the research team and asked if they are interested in participa ting in the study. 
If they do not pi[INVESTIGATOR_639432] a voice mail will be left (see script) and they will be called 
back up to two additional times (unless the participant calls us back first).  
At the AU local testing site potential participants will be giv en an informational flyer about 
the study.  The flyer will also be made into posters that will be posted at the testing site. 
The flyer will explain that if they test positive they may be eligible to participate in a 
research study evaluating the effects o f nasal irrigation on symptoms associated with 
COVID -19, and instructing them to call the number on the flyer for more information when 
their positive test result returns. The flyer will also provide information about the on -line 
health care portal which c an be used to obtain test results more quickly. In addition to the 
flyer a banner will be added to the health care portal informing users about the study and 
providing contact [CONTACT_639467]. A minimum of once a day a 
member of the r esearch team will obtain the list of positive results from the on -site testing 
facility.  Those individuals who tested positive and who meet study inclusion criteria will 
be called and asked if they are interested in participating in the study (see phone s cript). If 
patient is interested in hearing more the study will be explained and remote consent will 
be obtained. Participants will be asked to enter the phone number of the research team 
into their cell phone in order easily identify future calls.  
4.1.1.  Eligibl e participants will be consented remotely and their study materials (consisting of a 
nasal irrigation device (Neilmed sinus irrigation bottle or Navage unit) with 28+ 
accompanying saline pods/packets, two gallon jugs of distilled water, a physical copy of 
the consent form, an instructional sheet, and the randomly allocated additive (baking soda 
or betadine) with a ½ tsp scoop), will be delivered to their residence by a member of the 
research team using COVID -19 precautions (masks, maintaining 6 ft. or more physical 
distance, door drop off) later that day.

Protocol Title : [COVID -19] Saline Nasal Irrigation to Reduce COVID -19 Severity   
Principal Investigator s: Amy Baxter,  MD; Matt Lyon, MD  
1. Objectives  
Describe the purpose, specific aims, and hypothesis:   
Research suggests that acidic pH and nasal viral load contribute to replication and disease severity 
of COVID19. We plan to test saline nasal irrigation with either Alkalinized nasal saline or ½ tsp of 
the virucidal  povidone -iodine twice daily in patients recently testing positive for SARS -CoV -2. We 
hypothesize that nasal irrigation debridement with either the basic or virucidal intervention will be 
correlated with reduced COVID -19 progression to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] , and  reduction in symptom 
severity, supportive oxygen, and death in COVID -19 positive patients 5 5 years of age  and older  
Specific Aims : 
Evaluate the number of twice -daily saline nasal irrigation s with either povidone -iodine  or ½ tsp of baking soda in one 
of tw o over -the-counter irrigation devices in patients tested positive for COVID -19 with regards to clinical outcomes.  
 
      Technical Objective 1:  To assess reduction in COVID19 -related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6042], symptoms,  admission, supplemental  
oxygen use, ICU admission, and death in patients with differing nasal irrigation frequency . 
 
Technical Objective 2:  Assess reduction in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6042], symptoms, admission, 
supplemental oxygen use, ICU admission, and death in patients with alkalinization or 
virucidal additives to nasal irrigation.   
 
• Evaluate impact of nasal irrigation compared to published historical reports and meta -analyses  of outcomes in 
similar patient groups including household spread.  
• Evaluate impact of nasal irrigation  on COVID -19 related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_639436].  
• Evaluate dose -response of irrigation to clinical outcomes as noted above.  
• Evaluate impact of race, days of symptoms, and pre -existing conditions on utility of nasal irrigati on to reduce

 Describe the background and rationale for the study:  
 
The severe acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_6507] 2 (SARS -CoV -2) pathogen is a single stranded positive sense RNA virus, 
with a similar spi[INVESTIGATOR_639437] -CoV and MERS -CoV. Clinical coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -
19) caused by [CONTACT_639468]: younger patients are dramatically 
less impacted than the elderly; obesity, diabetes, race and hypertension are independent risk factors; male patients fare more 
poorly than females; the duration from infection to mild symptoms to severe symptoms averages 14 -17 days; anosmia is present 
in up to 80% of patients; and asymptomatic transmission is common.  
 
Recent work demonstrates that the attack entry overwhelmingly occurs via respi[INVESTIGATOR_639438]2 receptors in ciliated epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663], (1) explaining many of the clinical pathogenic differences. Nasal 
ACE2 receptors are upregulated in obesity, diabetes and hypertension. Children have minimally developed sinuses, lower 
expression of ACE2 and TMPSSR genes, and much smaller nasal cavities compar ed to adults, with males over 70 having 
significantly larger cavities and mucosa than women. (2) Furthermore, viremia is infrequent, supp orting the hypothesis of local 
mechanical spread of the virus toward the lungs as a predominant means of infectivity.  Alternately, genetic expression of the 
ciliated nasal ACE2 and TPMSSR genes has been shown to activate expression in the lungs.  
 
The prepo nderance of nasal entry and the slow time frame for sufficient viral replication suggest that a topi[INVESTIGATOR_639439] , allowing  time for immune response without inciting an 
overwhel ming cytokine storm. While drug treatment tests are ongoing, the nasal entry point and previous work in reduction of 
viral load and symptoms with other pathogens suggest topi[INVESTIGATOR_639440] g attachment, viral fusion, and viral load, thus reducing morbidity and mortality.  
 
Significance  
If this study yields positive results and shows nasal irrigation to be a safe, inexpensive and accepted 
method for reducing COVID19 severity in a racially diverse and economically challenged population at 
higher risk for morbidity and mortality, it will potentially save hundreds of thousands of lives.  
 
Research & Development by [CONTACT_2312]  
1) Nasal viral load is highly proportional to infectivity.(4) Mec hanically flushing out SARS -CoV -2 would be expected 
to reduce the viral load.  
2) The nasal mucosa is specifically the site of SARS -CoV -2 entry; ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in nasal 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663].(1) Indeed, an intranasal inhibitor of spi[INVESTIGATOR_639441] -
CoV -2. “Intranasal application of EK1C4 before or after  challenge with HCoV -OC43 protected mice from 
infection, suggesting that EK1C4 could be used for prevention and treatment of infection by [CONTACT_639469] -CoV -2 and other emerging SARSr -CoVs.” (3) 
3) Mechanical reduction of cellular infection: The viral lipid layers of SARS -CoV -2 need to fuse after the spi[INVESTIGATOR_639442]2 receptors, so physical flow of nasal irrigation may reduce likel ihood of intracellular fusion 
and thus infection. Per the Nature article, “Our data highlight the possibility that viral transmissibility is 
dependent on the spatial distribution of receptor accessibility along the respi[INVESTIGATOR_4352].”  
14 
 4) Buying immunologic  time: given the apparent mechanical rather than blood -borne slow advance of COVID -[ADDRESS_855334] this 
system, lending credence to the surface area/mechanical model of viral severity. The respi[INVESTIGATOR_639443] -COV also spread mechanically, but more efficiently in lungs,(5) supporting interventions prior to 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_639444].  
5) Irriga tion works for colds:  Nasal lavage (rinsing) seems better than spray. Multiple RCTs show statistically 
significant results, and the mechanical concepts of COVID lend greater rationale than upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_639445]. In ad dition, nasal irrigation significantly reduce not only load but 
duration and severity of other viral illnesses even when symptoms had been established as much as 48 hours.(6, 
7) Given the slow progression of COVID -19, earlier initiation of irrigation in po sitive patients not yet requiring 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_639446] a more marked impact on reducing morbidity.  
6) Nasal antimicrobial reduces viral infections in bovine animals: from 28% in those pre -treated with one intranasal 
NO dose compared to 78% of animals  treated with saline placebo.(8) For humans, dilute povidone -iodine is 
widely used for chronic sinus infections and decolonizing before surgery.(9 -12) 
7) SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_855335] more acidic nasal mucosa (6.4 compared to 6.8 in whites) could contribute to the differential 
infection rate,(13) rendering this intervention helpful in a population with higher attack rates and severity. In 
addition, drug targets such as zinc, quercetin, and ivermectin act by [CONTACT_639470]. Providing weak bas e through mild alkalinization to 7.3 could 
directly reduce the ability of viral replication.  
8) SARS -CoV -2 is sensitive to povidone -iodine solution,(14) as are other viral pathogens,(15) and it  is safe for the 
nasal passages.(9)  
9) Mortality in countries where nasal irrigation is widespread is dramatically lower than in countries where irrigation 
is not standard.  Thailand, Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia have populations in which up to 80% of the population 
commonly use nasal irrigation.(6, 16, 17) Death rates there are fractional compared to other countries which 
only wear masks or bow in greeting but do not have a cultural habit of irrigation.

4. Number of Subjects/Records/Samples Collected  
Indicate the total number of subjects to be accrued/records reviewed/samples collected across all sites:  
400 
 
5. Recruitment Methods  
Describe when, where, and how potential subjects will be recruited:  
There will be two gr oups of participants: an active (exposed to intervention) group and a passive control group. The passive 
“nonexposed” control group (not interested in enrolling or not able to be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] ) will be people [ADDRESS_855346] Procedure Measures (n = 200): Treatment diary; clinical outcomes called weekly   
Active participants will be community outpatients who have tested positive for COVID -19. Participants will be recruited by 
[CONTACT_19201] a list o f outpatient positive results from the AU testing center of patients age 55 years or older (See data collection 
form.) Persons on this list will be called by a member of the research team and asked if they are interested in participating  in 
the study. If t hey do not pi[INVESTIGATOR_639432] a voice mail will be left (see script) and they will be called back up to two 
additional times (unless the participant calls us back first).  
 
At the AU local testing site potential participants will be given an informational fl yer about the study (see recruitment flyer).  
The flyer will also be made into posters that will be posted at the testing site. The flyer will explain that if they test po sitive 
they may be eligible to participate in a research study evaluating the effects  of nasal irrigation on symptoms associated with 
COVID -19, and instructing them to call the number on the flyer for more information when their positive test result returns. 
The flyer will also provide information about the on -line health care portal which  can be used to obtain test results more 
quickly. In addition to the flyer a banner will be added to the health care portal informing users about the study and 
providing contact [CONTACT_639467]. A minimum of once a day a member of the  research team will 
obtain the list of positive results from the on -site testing facility.  Those  individuals who tested positive and who meet study 
inclusion criteria will be called and asked if they are interested in participating in the study (see phone  script). If patient is 
interested in hearing more the study will be explained and remote consent will be obtained.  Participants  will be asked to 
enter the phone number of the research team into their cell phone in order easily identify future calls.

A site is defined as an institution/organization/university that is collaborating with Augusta University  
 
If this research involves multiple sites, specify which is the lead site and describe the roles of each site in the study.  
 
If Augusta University will serve as the lead site, indicate that all required approvals are already obtained or will be obtained at 
each site prior to project implementation. In addition:  
 
Describe the processes you have in place to ensure successful coordination of activities among sites. For example, do all sites 
have the most current version of the protocol, consent document, and HIPAA  authorization? How will modifications be 
communicated to sites and approved prior to implementation? How will participating sites be kept abreast of any problems, 
interim results, or the eventual closure of the study?  
 
Describe the mechanisms you have in place to ensure that all local site investigators conduct the study appropriately and that 
engaged participating sites safeguard data as required by [CONTACT_28584]. Please confirm that all non -
compliance  and /or unanticipated problems  associated with the study protocol or applicable requirements will be reported in 
accordance with local policy.

Reliance agreements (i.e. IRB Authorization Agreement (IAA), Individual Investigator Agreement (IIA), etc.) are formal 
arrangements between institutions allowing the IRB of one institution to rely on the IRB of another institution for review of 
human subjects research. Investigators working at multiple institutions, each having an IRB, may choose to have one IRB 
become the IRB of record over some or all participating sites. This means that the AU IRB is either the reviewing IRB (IRB  of 
Record) or is relying on another IRB for IRB oversight of the research activity.  
 
If the study will utilize a reliance agreement or a single IRB, please describe which institution(s) will be relying on anoth er IRB 
for review and which institution will  be responsible for the IRB oversight of the relying IRB(s).  
 
Note: Requests for Reliance Agreements should be submitted by [CONTACT_639475]. All request for Reliance 
Agreements should be submitted through IRB Net following the procedures outlined in Forms and Templates

8. Procedures Involved  
 
a. Describe the procedures involved to include those procedures that are standard evaluation 
and/or care and those that are solely for research purposes:  
For research purposes:  
Following consent – Block randomization to the twice daily irrigation with alkalinization or betadine will be done by 
[CONTACT_639460].  Out of the list of positives for the day (from both the lab and any call ins) we will call in 
sequential  order to obtain a consecutive sample that meets all inclusion criteria and do not meet any exclusion criteria.  
 
For the other patients on the list from the lab who tested positive for COVID -19 and meet 
screening criteria (age 55 or older, etc.) their information will be kept on a password protected 
spreadsheet and stored on the _HUMAN folder in box (also referred to  as a research box) so that 
approximately one month later we can go back and determine hospi[INVESTIGATOR_639452] 
[ADDRESS_855347] a box of study supplies  delivered to the ir residence by a member of the research 
team using COVID -19 precautions (masks, maintaining 6 ft. or more physical distance, door drop off). At this time the 
research team member will ask the participant to confirm receipt of the materials via text.  
 
Either NeilMed nasal irrigation unit or Navage will be available on different days, with a goal of 50% of each device used 
in order to avoid concerns about conflict of interest.  
  
Participants will be called (Day 2 call) after they receive their materials to answer any questions. Directions for nasal lavage 
will be included with the materials and via email. Participants will be instructed to watch a 1 minute video 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYZDeiOVJx0  on days with NeilMed supplies, or  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIfgNNLX1L8  if they received a Navage.  
 
Intervention – twice -a-day nasal lavage  
Twice -a-day virucidal group:  Participants randomized to betadine will receive 2 gallon jugs of distil led water, two NeilMed 
Sinus Irrigation bottles and 28 salination packets  (with some extras) , OR one Navage unit with 28 SaltPods (and some 
extras), and a cardboard receptacle labeled “used saline containers” to keep track of adherence.   
 
Those randomized to receive betadine will also receive  one bottle of povidone -iodine, a one -sheet instruction with 
photographs demonstrating how to add ½ tsp betadine in addition to the salination packet to the sinus irrigation bottle  or 
Navage unit reservoir prior to Salt Pod, along with a ½ tsp measuring spoon .  
 
Twice -a-day alkalinized group : Participants randomized to alkalinization will receive [ADDRESS_855348] receptacle labeled “used 
saline containers” to keep track of adherence. Those randomized to alkalinization will also receive a box of baking soda , ½ 
tsp measuring spoon and instructions on how to add the  baking soda.  
 
When study materials are procured the identifying information for the products (lot number, etc.) 
will be recorded so that we can track what materials were given to the participants. We will use 
the accountability log and the device accounta bility log (see attached).  
 
As part of the materials box an instruction sheet will be included (see attached) that will detail the 
process for nasal irrigation and equipment cleaning. The websites for on -line resources will be 
included as well as study te am contact [CONTACT_3031]. Participants will be reminded on the 
instruction sheet that they should be the only one using the equipment for their safety and the 
safety of other household members. Information on this sheet will also include procedures for 
track ing material use via Qualtrics (see data collection sheet) and remind participants that at the 
end of the study they will keep or discard of all used and unused materials but that none are to 
be returned to researchers nor transferred to another person.  
 
Prompts to complete study materials (see attached) will be sent to participants (text and/or email) 
via Qualtrics twice a day for the duration of the study period.

6.5 Daily Adherence: Participants will receive two daily reminders to do nasal irrigation and subsequent verification, and 
asked to kee p a daily study diary using Qualtrics. The additive packages for nasal irrigation will be attached to a one page 
card with numbers and days to help patients visually assess whether they have done it yet that day. During the daily 
verification participants will be asked to report from their diary the presence or absence  of the following symptoms: loss of 
smell, fatigue, cough, muscle aches, harder to breathe, AND to report any other medications taken, AND  to provide a  
photograph of this card as well as the n umber of used packets in the box . (See data collection instrument.)  
 
An investigator will call the patient or their designated contact [CONTACT_98205] 2, 7, 14, and 28.  
 
6.6 Outcomes : The following outcomes will be collected via GRAChIE as described above (see data collection spreadsheet): 
visit to an emergency department Y/ N; chief complaint  was the patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057] y/n (if yes admission date/discharge 
date); was the patient administered supplemental oxygen y/n was the patient admitted to an intensive care unit y/n was 
22 
 patient mechanically intubated Y/N was patient given assisted ventilation with CPAP/HighFlow/BIPAP Y/N did the patient 
die as a result of this illness Y/N (date of death) . 
 
For the purposes of the study, COVID -19 related chief complaints will include any of the top 
five symptoms associated with emergency department presentation: Cough,  Fever 
(subjective or >100.4°F/38°C),  Myalgia,  Headache, or  Dyspnea.18 Other ED presentations 
resulting in discharge without subsequent admission will not meet th e criteria of morbidity 
severity related to this study. In cases where patients are admitted, discharge diagnosis or 
cause or contributing cause of death will be considered for categorization of COVID -related or 
not-COVID related. In cases where potential for COVID19 related admission or death is 
ambiguous, a member of the research team (MD) will be asked to assess the information 
gathered from the chart and make a determination of COVID or non -COVID related.

8.1. Participants will receive two prompts a day to complete the nasal lavage and complete the data collection diary.  
8.2. Participants who opt for the online data collection tool will be provided with a phone call to follow up on data 
collection when they don’t complete online data collection for two days.  In the case of a patient reporting a summary 
number of irrigation events or a range of irrigation events, the estimate or median number of irrigation events range 
will be used for analysis. If no data is obtain ed after confirmation of the initial irrigation, the patient’s data will be 
excluded from the continuous variable irrigation analyses, but will be included in analysis of betadine/alkaliniaztion 
and Navage/Neilmed by [CONTACT_118067].  
8.3. Sources of Research  Material – See “measures”. Background information will be obtained from the patient at the time 
of enrollment. (see Measures). Outcomes will be assessed by [CONTACT_639476] .  
8.4. Instrument - For the study, an irrigation diary will be created, and packets of nasal irrigation will be attached to a one 
page card with numbers and days to help patients visually assess whether they have done it yet that day. A photograph 
of this card will be requested as part of  the patient diary.  
8.5. Follow -up – An investigator blinded to allocation will call the patient  on Day2, Day 7, Day 14 and Day 28 to check on 
their current symptoms (if the participant is unable to be contact[CONTACT_639477]'s cu rrent symptoms.  
 
For the control group, after enrollment is stopped, eligible patients with a positive test who 
were not enrolled will be separated into two groups: those who refused enrollment and 
those who were not able to be reached or responded too late to be enrolled on the day of 
contact. One control will be chosen from each group by [CONTACT_4868]: sex, race, 
age +/ - [ADDRESS_855351] +/ - [ADDRESS_855352] will be expanded to +/ - two weeks. If race is list ed as “unspecified”, initial 
experience with enrolled patients supports that commonly this is chosen by [CONTACT_639478]. 
Thus, when matching with a Black patient, two “unspecified” matches will be chosen and 
searched in order in GRAChIE. The first patient w ith matching race will be the Control 
included. If the criteria for matching cannot be met with 1 from each of the “refused” and 
“uncontact[INVESTIGATOR_530]” pools, two matches will be found in the other pool. The EMR will then be 
searched for the following information f rom the Control group within [ADDRESS_855353] been enrolled (see data collection spreadsheet) : vi sit to an emergency 
department  Y/N, chief complaint ; was the patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057] y/n (if yes admission

 a. Describe the data analysis plan, including any statistical procedures:  
Interim analysis planned at [ADDRESS_855355] less or greater severity or lack of efficacy with 
povidone -iodine versus alkalination for safety or for preponderance of efficacy of 
irrigation itself, study will be halted  to analyze the case: control outcomes for 
disease severity: ED visit, admission, ICU, death, and historic outcomes for 
household transmission. The povidone -iodine/alkalinization and frequency of 
irrigation endpoints will be evaluated separately as power p ermits.  
 
8.6. Endpoints  
8.6.1.  Primary  – Primary outcome will be a statistical difference between need for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_639454]. The case:control analysis will 
be conducted by [CONTACT_118067].  
8.6.2.  Secondary  - Secondary outcomes include differences between symptoms, supplemental 
oxygen use, ICU admission, mortality.  
   
Statistical Analysis  -  Initial analyses will be conducted to determine whether demographic variables are 
related to the following d ependent variables: hospi[INVESTIGATOR_21186]; oxygen use; admission; ICU admission; mortality. 
To examine sex and racial differences on the dependent variables, t-tests will be used unless non -normal 
distribution is noted, in which case Mann Whitney U will be used. Baseline measures of duration, pre -
existing conditions, and symptoms will be compared across the conditions to ensure that the randomization 
process was effective. Analyses of compliance by [CONTACT_639481]. If any of these analyses 
result in significant findings, they will be considered as covariates in subsequent analyses. To test the effect 
of treatment change in disease severity, either t -tests for normally distributed data or the Mann -Whitney will 
be used.  Pearson’s correlation coefficient will assess if an inverse linear relationship exists between number 
of irrigation uses and illness severity outcomes.

 Power Analysis:  The analysis will include treatment compliance with doses as a continuous variable 
correlated with clinical outcome), and full compliance (two rinses daily until resolution of symptoms or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]).  A 2 -sided Fisher’s exact test for binar y outcomes will be used, with an alpha of 0.05 and 
beta of 0.80 requiring 100 patients in each group, anticipating an a priori severity of 20% needing oxygen or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5478] a 50% reduction to 10% being significant. Subanalyses will evaluate the pre valence of 
relevant pre -existing conditions and severity of symptoms at initiation of treatment.

9.3.2 Case Control matching: Power was calculated two ways, by [CONTACT_56047] a  
simulation comparing the likelihood of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and using a z -test 
comparing independent proportions. Both analyses assumed reduced 
variation in proportions due to accounting for the correlates of age, sex, and 
race, and resulted in similar calcul ations. A ssuming that 25% of the 
matched control participants and 10% of the treatment  participants would

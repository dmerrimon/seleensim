Version: 04/24/[ADDRESS_645972] Cardiac Resynchronization therapy (CRT) utilizing biventricular pacing 
(BVP) has had on heart failure patients, one-third of patients do not respond to CRT, and CRT 
may result in worsening heart failure and increased mortality in some patients. We hypothesize 
that in patients with heart failure (HF) eligible for CRT as part of routine standard-of-care based 
on accepted Class I or Class II indications, His-Purkinje conduction system pacing (HPCSP)-
optimized trial of CRT (HOT-CRT) may not only be safely achieved but will also be associated 
with superior echocardiographic and clinical outcomes compared to conventional BVP during 
CRT. We aim to determine the overall rate of successful HOT-CRT at the time of implant of 
CRT in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], collecting data in BVP and HOT-CRT on acute and mid-term outcomes at 
Geisinger. Primary outcomes include freedom from major complications and change in left 
ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) at 6 months. To compare the effectiveness of HOT-CRT 
versus traditional CRT in patients with heart failure, patients will be randomized to either HOT-
CRT or BVP and will remain blinded to their treatment allocation. Treating physicians will be 
aware of assignment in order to facilitate routine device follow-up. Echocardiographic evaluation 
will also be performed in a blinded manner. Crossover is permitted between treatment group 
allocation as follows: (1) If CS lead (BVP) cannot be placed due to difficult cannulation of the 
CS, limited branches at the posterolateral or lateral wall, or phrenic nerve capture, patients may 
then crossover to HOT-CRT. All efforts will be made to achieve CRT using CS lead. (2) HOT-
CRT patients may crossover if HPCSP lead cannot be positioned with adequate stability and 
reasonable pacing output and acceptable electrical resynchronization cannot be achieved. 
Echocardiographic response to CRT (improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction) and a 
combination of clinical, electrocardiographic, and echocardiographic endpoints will be 
prospectively studied. Any complications will also be assessed prospectively, both acutely and 
throughout the study period.
3 BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE
Heart failure (HF) is one of the leading causes of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], morbidity and mortality in the 
[LOCATION_002]. In addition, healthcare costs of heart failure in the [LOCATION_002] exceed $35 
billion annually.1 CRT utilizing BVP has made major improvements to symptoms and mortality 
in HF patients with [LOCATION_001] Heart Association (NYHA) symptoms class II, III or ambulatory 
IV, left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) < 35% and widened QRS by [CONTACT_53402] 
(ECG).2,3,[ADDRESS_645973] of patients do not respond to CRT.5 
In some patients, CRT may result in worsening heart failure and increased mortality. The 
anatomic location of the LV lead, patient specific characteristics, myocardial substrate and ECG

Version: 04/24/2023characteristics may affect clinical response. Novel approaches to improve CRT outcomes are 
necessary and several new approaches are evolving. Small studies have examined patients with 
intact intrinsic atrioventricular (AV) conduction and normal or near-normal conduction via the 
right bundle branch. In these patients, LV pacing synchronized to produce fusion with the 
intrinsic activation via the right bundle branch (sLVP) results in superior LV and right 
ventricular (RV) electrical activation and function compared to biventricular pacing.  In a study 
using sLVP, patients with >50% sLVP had significantly decreased heart failure hospi[INVESTIGATOR_501532] <50% sLVP.6 However, this algorithm is limited by [CONTACT_501537]’s intact AV nodal conduction to allow for conduction to occur normally via the 
right bundle branch. Significant number of patients with heart failure require atrial pacing and or 
have long PR intervals limiting the utility of this approach.  Recent studies suggest improved 
outcomes with His bundle pacing (HBP).[ADDRESS_645974] CRT.9 A recent small pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] (HisSync) comparing HBP 
with BVP could not demonstrate superiority with HBP due to high crossover rates.10 Nonetheless 
this study showed a trend towards improved clinical and echocardiographic outcomes with HBP 
compared to BVP. Many patients in these studies show partial correction of left bundle branch 
block (LBBB) with HBP. HBP can also provide robust AV synchronization in patients with long 
AV delays or AV nodal block. By [CONTACT_501538], HBP can provide clinical and hemodynamic benefits. Our early 
experience shows that His bundle Optimized LV pacing can combine AV synchrony with fusion 
LV pacing.11 The QRS duration and morphology can mimic normal physiologic pattern in this 
situation. Permanent His bundle pacing utilizes FDA-approved clinical tools to precisely position 
the pacing lead at the His bundle region and stimulates the ventricles through the intrinsic His-
Purkinje system, which results in synchronous electrical and mechanical activation. There is 
great clinical uncertainty for CRT utilization in HF patients “in the middle” with intermediate 
ECG criteria; QRS duration 130-149ms or non-LBBB morphology; currently Class IIa-IIb 
indications. This is a significant clinical problem because these patients with intermediate ECG 
criteria represented 40-45% of those enrolled in the large randomized trials that showed benefit 
of CRT. Even in these patients with right bundle branch block (RBBB), HBP has been shown to 
normalize conduction by [CONTACT_501539].12 Because of the ability of His-
Purkinje conduction system pacing to achieve significant electrical resynchronization in the 
majority of patients undergoing CRT, this form of pacing has the theoretical potential to improve

3.1 Hypothesis
We hypothesize that:
1. in patients with advanced heart failure and evidence of intraventricular conduction 
disease who meet criteria for CRT, HOT-CRT may be safely achieved and,
2. HOT-CRT will be associated with superior echocardiographic and clinical outcomes 
compared to conventional biventricular pacing (BVP) during CRT.
3.2 Specific Aim 1
To determine the overall rate of successful HOT-CRT at the time of implant of CRT. Patients 
randomized to HOT-CRT but who cannot be successfully implanted with a HPCSP lead will 
crossover to traditional coronary sinus (CS) lead position.
3.[ADDRESS_645975]-pacing (degree of 
QRS narrowing) and incidence of major periprocedural complications (pericardial tamponade, 
need for lead revision, etc.). Mid-term outcomes include echocardiographic response at 6 months 
along with a composite clinical outcome of heart failure hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], ventricular arrhythmias, 
crossover, and all-cause mortality.
4 PRELIMINARY DATA
In patients with bundle branch blocks (BBB), capture thresholds to correct the BBB may limit 
the ability to achieve successful HBP. High pacing thresholds may lead to premature battery 
depletion. Recently an alternative form of conduction system pacing has gained significant 
momentum. By [CONTACT_501541], very low and stable capture thresholds can be 
achieved.13,14,15,16,17 This new approach, called left bundle branch pacing (LBBP), has been 
shown to achieve significant narrowing of the paced QRS and improve clinical outcomes in 
patients with LV dysfunction and LBBB. In short- and medium-term follow-up, this approach 
has been shown to be feasible in a very high percentage of patients.

CRT and BVP. Treating physicians will be aware of assignment in order to facilitate routine 
device follow-up. Echocardiographic evaluation will also be performed in a blinded manner. 
Study physicians with the role of completing this evaluation will be blinded to lead placement.
Crossover is permitted between treatment group allocation if:
CS lead (BVP) cannot be placed due to difficult cannulation of the CS, limited 
branches at the posterolateral or lateral wall, or phrenic nerve capture. These patients 
may then crossover to HOT-CRT. All efforts will be made to achieve CRT using CS 
lead.
HOT-CRT patients may crossover if HPCSP lead cannot be positioned with adequate 
stability and reasonable pacing output and acceptable electrical resynchronization 
cannot be achieved.
Implant procedure will be per routine percutaneous access, as is standard for pacemaker and 
implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs). All patients will receive FDA-approved cardiac 
resynchronization therapy pacemaker or defibrillator device, as per standard of care outlined for 
the patient.
Follow-up will be performed at [ADDRESS_645977] of care. In addition, routine device and clinical follow-up will be scheduled at 3, 
and 6 months, with remote device monitoring between scheduled visits, as needed.
Electrocardiography (i.e., ECG) will be performed pre-implant, prior to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345], and 
at 3- and 6-months post-discharge, as is standard of care. Echocardiography will be performed 
pre-implant, at 6 months to evaluate for change in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), 
chamber dimension, and wall motion with strain imaging as is standard of care in the treatment 
of patients with advanced heart failure. NYHA functional class and quality of life, as measured

The primary clinical endpoint for the study (Aim 2) is change in left ventricular ejection fraction 
at 6 months. The primary safety endpoint (Aim 1) – freedom from major complications such as 
pericardial tamponade or need for CRT lead revision.
Secondary endpoints are as follows:
Clinical: Composite of heart failure hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], ventricular tachycardia 
(VT)/ventricular fibrillation (VF), crossover of treatment and any-cause mortality at 6 
months will be assessed. NYHA functional class and quality of life will also be assessed.
Electrocardiographic: Change in QRS duration between pre-implant and at hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7954], and 6 months will be performed. Arrhythmia occurrence (i.e., atrial fibrillation 
(AF), nonsustained VT, VT or VF requiring device therapy) will be documented 
throughout the study period.
Echocardiographic: Change in left ventricular end-systolic volume index, chamber 
dimension, and tissue-strain pre-implant, and at 6 months will be performed by [CONTACT_501542].
Regarding primary complication endpoints, complications will be assessed prospectively both 
acutely and throughout the study period, including:
Procedure-related: pneumothorax, perforation, pericardial effusion, or hemorrhage
System-related: implant site hematoma, implant site infection
Lead-related: lead dislodgement, lead fracture, inability to pace due to high threshold, 
phrenic capture
Patients will be allocated to HOT-CRT or standard BVP (CS lead) prior to implant procedure.

Version: 04/24/2023Patients randomized to biventricular pacing will undergo left ventricular lead placement in the 
coronary sinus venous branches.
Patients randomized to HOT-CRT will undergo CRT as described below. His bundle pacing lead 
will be placed initially to achieve CRT. If complete resynchronization is achieved (BBB 
normalization) but capture thresholds are high (1.5-2V), the lead may be placed in the distal 
conduction system (left bundle branch area). If only partial QRS narrowing is achieved, a 
coronary sinus lead may be placed and LV timing may be optimized to achieve maximal 
resynchronization. This will be at the discretion of the implanting physician.

5.8 Statistics
Geisinger’s Biostatistics Core will perform the statistical analyses. The statistician will be 
responsible for assisting with study design and statistical analysis to understand the role of HOT-
CRT in HF patients.
5.8.[ADDRESS_645982] data and estimate parameters that are needed to design a larger 
study. Therefore, the sample size is based on estimating the precision of the change in left 
ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). If we assume an equal distribution of subjects with LVEF 
at baseline above or below 35%, then from the BLOCK-HF trial20 we further assume that the 
standard deviation of change in LVEF at 6 months will be 7.93. With a sample size of 50 patients 
in each arm, we can estimate the precision of a 95% confidence interval (i.e., half-width) to be 
2.25. A sample size of 50 was chosen due to budget limits.
Survival analysis will be conducted between the two randomized groups to assess time-to-event 
as an endpoint. 
5.8.2 Statistical Power and Sample Size Considerations
Analysis will follow the “intent-to-treat” principle. That is, subjects will be analyzed based on 
their randomization allocation. A small number of patients might cross-over into the other arm so 
we will complete a secondary analysis using the per-protocol principle where subjects are 
analyzed based on their final treatment allocation. Data will be fully described using mean and 
standard deviation or median and inter-quartile range for continuous measures, and frequency 
and percentage for categorical variables. Baseline variables will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_501551]. Any imbalance will be adjusted for in the estimation of 
the parameters of interest. Successful placement (Aim 1) will be summarized in the HOT-CRT 
group among those randomized to this group. The percentage and 95% confidence interval will 
be estimated.  A logistic regression model will be fit to identify baseline factors that associate 
with success. The primary endpoint in Aim 2, change in LVEF, will be estimated along with the

randomization arms will also be estimated. No formal statistical inferences will be conducted in 
this study. Deliverables
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_501534], collect preliminary data, and further 
develop and refine infrastructure to test hypothesis(es) in a fully powered trial. We anticipate 
being able to identify specific clinical and health care utilizations endpoints during the pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251], 
which will be important to further investigate in a larger, powered trial. We hope to publish our 
findings and add to the generalizable knowledge to inform physicians, policy-makers, and the 
healthcare community of real-world outcomes.

6.1 Adverse Event Reporting
Clinical adverse events (AEs) will be monitored throughout the study.  The date and time of 
onset and outcome, course, intensity, action taken, and causality to study treatment will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_9154]. In the event of a serious AE (SAE), this will be reported to the 
Geisinger IRB (GIRB) according to the GIRB guidelines. 
Definitions:
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward, undesired, or unplanned event in the form of signs, 
symptoms, disease, or laboratory or physiologic observations occurring in a person given a test 
article or in a clinical study. The event does not need to be causally related to the test article or 
clinical study. 
An AE includes, but is not limited to, the following:
Any clinically significant worsening of a preexisting condition.
An AE occurring from abuse (e.g., use for nonclinical reasons) of a test article.
An AE that has been associated with the discontinuation of the use of a test article.
A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE that:
Results in death.
Is life-threatening (see below).
Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1324] (see 
below).
Results in a persistent or significant disability or incapacity (see below).
Results in cancer.
Results in a congenital anomaly or birth defect.
Additionally, important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, 
or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_37347], based on appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such 
events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency 
IRB NUMBER: 2020-0831

18
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY
Version: 04/24/2023room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse.
Life-threatening refers to immediate risk of death as the event occurred per the reporter. A 
life-threatening experience does not include an experience, had it occurred in a more severe 
form, might have caused death, but as it actually occurred, did not create an immediate risk of 
death. For example, hepatitis that resolved without evidence of hepatic failure would not be 
considered life-threatening, even though hepatitis of a more severe nature can be fatal. Similarly, 
an allergic reaction resulting in angioedema of the face would not be life-threatening, even 
though angioedema of the larynx, allergic bronchospasm, or anaphylaxis can be fatal.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_138821] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17127] a 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_138822]; however, it is not in itself considered 
an SAE. In absence of an AE, a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17127] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_501535]. This is the case in the following situations:
The hospi[INVESTIGATOR_112041] a procedure required 
by [CONTACT_760].
The hospi[INVESTIGATOR_112042] a routine procedure 
followed by [CONTACT_16018] (e.g., stent removal after surgery). This should be recorded in the 
study file.
In addition, a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a preexisting condition that has not worsened does not constitute 
an SAE.
Disability is defined as a substantial disruption in a person’s ability to conduct normal life 
functions.
If there is any doubt about whether the information constitutes an SAE, the information is treated 
as an SAE.
A protocol-related adverse event is an AE occurring during a clinical study that is not related 
to the test article but is considered by [CONTACT_55886] (or designee) to be 
related to the research conditions, i.e., related to the fact that a subject is participating in the 
study. For example, a protocol-related AE may be an untoward event occurring during a washout 
period or an event related to a medical procedure required by [CONTACT_760].
Other Reportable Information. Certain information, although not considered an SAE, must be 
recorded, reported, and followed up as indicated for an SAE. This includes: 
IRB NUMBER: 2020-0831

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY
Version: 04/24/2023Pregnancy exposure to a test article, except for exposure to prenatal vitamins. If a 
pregnancy is confirmed, use of the test article must be discontinued immediately.  
Information about pregnancy exposure includes the entire course of pregnancy and 
delivery, and perinatal and neonatal outcomes, even if there are no abnormal findings. 
Both maternal and paternal exposure are considered other reportable information. For 
exposure involving the female partner of a male subject, the necessary information must 
be collected from the subject, while respecting the confidentiality of the partner.
Lactation exposure to a test article with or without an AE.   
Overdose of a test article as specified in this protocol with or without an AE. Baby 
[CONTACT_501552].
Inadvertent or accidental exposure to a test article with or without an AE.
6.[ADDRESS_645985]’s AEs and SAEs will be recorded and reported from the signing of the informed 
consent form to conclusion of patient follow-up in accordance with GIRB policy guidelines.
6.3 Serious Adverse Event Reporting
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_501536]. If an SAE has 
not resolved at the time of the initial report, a follow-up report including all relevant new or 
reassessed information (e.g., concomitant medication, medical history) will be submitted to 
GIRB. An SAE will be followed until either resolved or stabilized.
7 PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS
7.1 Informed Consent and HIPAA Authorization
The investigator will provide for the protection of the subjects by [CONTACT_131934]. The informed consent/authorization form will be submitted to the IRB for review 
and approval.  
Before any procedures specified in this protocol are performed, a subject must:
Be informed of all pertinent aspects of the study and all elements of informed consent. 
Be given time to ask questions and time to consider the decision to participate.
Voluntarily agree to participate in the study.

7.2 Potential Risks/Benefits and Protection of Human Subjects Against Risks
Potential Risks
Risks associated with both CS lead position and HBP which include, but are not limited to, the 
risk for cardiac perforation, tamponade, lead dislodgement, fracture, and site infections. Early 
data indicate that the two technologies are comparable with respect to risk profile.
All electronic study data will be kept in password-protected computer files and hard copy data 
will be stored in a locked environment that is only accessible only to the study team members. 
Data will be coded by [CONTACT_195117] a unique study identification number to patients’ medical record 
numbers. Analysis will be performed using the coded data. Only aggregate data without personal 
identifiers will be included when presenting results or submitting manuscripts for publication.
Benefits
There will be no direct benefit to patients who are included in this study. We hope that what is 
learned from this study will help others in the future.

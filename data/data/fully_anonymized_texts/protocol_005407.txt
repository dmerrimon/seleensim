[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
Date: December 16, 2024  
Study Protocol and Statistical Analysis Plan (with Results)  
  
PROTOCOL  
 
Study population.  25,[ADDRESS_612369] information for donors was 
provided by [CONTACT_477479][INVESTIGATOR_840] (SRTR) and is verified using Lexis Nexis Accurint.  
We anticipate that approximately 20% (n=5,070) of this cohort 
will have served as the primary caregiver for their recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]. 
Characteristics of the overall cohort and the subset of 
caregiver donors are in Table 1.  Moreover, the subset of 
caregivers > 50 years is greater than the whole cohort, further 
highlighting the need for aging research in this population.  
 
Donor questionnaire. All participants are contact[CONTACT_47605] 
a centralized phone bank maintained by [CONTACT_7071] R01’s PI [INVESTIGATOR_477471] a survey by [CONTACT_648], 
mail, or email. The following data are collected and maintained using a robust, redundant, secure, web -based 
computer entry system (REDCap): demograph ics (gender, date of birth, race /ethnicity ); socioeconomic 
(education, employment, marital status); family history of comorbid disease; follow -up (frequency of doctor 
visits pre and post -donation); comorbidities pre and post -donation (smo king, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, 
etc.), current hypertension, diabetes, or chronic kidney disease/end -stage renal disease, and mental health 
quality of life.  Patients are contact[CONTACT_51095] -up surveys annually. Furthermore, we  will leverage the 
infrastructure of the parent R01 to collect new primary data specific to caregivers. Among those who were  the 
primary caregiver s for their recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841] s, we will administer additional questions derived from the Bakas 
Caregiver Outcomes Scale and National Allian ce for Caregiving quantitative interviews, to describe their 
physical and mental health at time of donation, including self -reported caregiver burden and benefit pre and 
post-donation, the economic impact of caregiving, and the caregiving role in the context of donation .  
 
Medical records abstraction.  During completion of the questionnaire, donors are asked to provide signed 
waivers for medical records requests from their primary and other care providers. Pre -donation medical 
records are obtained from the transplant center. Post -donation medical record s are obtained from the 
transplant center, as available, and from the participants’ medical providers over time.  
 
Aim 1:  To assess emergency department utilization  associated with  caregiving among a cohort of 
living kidney donors who were obese at the time of donation . We will leverage an existing multi -center 
R01 study of a national cohort of obese living kidney donors, to quantify the association between a donor 
reporting that they served as the primary caregiver for the transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_477472] . We will adjust for baseline characteristics and will explore the presence of 
effect modification and interaction between caregiving status and donor age, race/ ethnicity, and rurality.  
 
Study population. The study population will consist of living donors with obesity identified by [CONTACT_7071] R01, 
categorized by [CONTACT_477480][INVESTIGATOR_841]. Donors will be 
stratified by [CONTACT_477481][INVESTIGATOR_841] (parent, child, spouse/life partner, other caregiver) and sex to allow us 
to explore sex as a biological variable.  We estimate that approximately  20% (n=5,070) were the caregiver for 
their recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841], of whom 40% were ≥ 50 years old (3% > 65 y ears), and  17% were minorities.  
 
Definition of caregiver.  Donors are asked whether they served as the primary caregiver (i.e., the main 
individual who provided unpaid caregiving activities pre and post -donation) for their transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841].  
 
Definition of outcome  of interest. As part of the parent R01, healthcare utilization data are  obtained from the 
questionnaire and include whether donors have utilized the ED since donation . Donors are asked to report not 
only whether they used the ED as well as the frequency of use.  
 
Aim 2:  To assess hospi[INVESTIGATOR_477473] a cohort of living kidney donors 
who were obese at the time of donation . We will use the same cohort from Aim [ADDRESS_612370].  The parent R01 also captures data on whether the donor has been 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_477474] . 
 

STATISTICAL DESIGN AND POWER  
 
Aim 1. Power calculation. Goren  et al. demonstrated a  significant difference in ED utilization by [CONTACT_477482]  (7.2% for caregivers vs. 4.0% for non -caregivers).[ADDRESS_612371] and a proportion of 4% 
experiencing ED use in the non-caregiver  group, we will have 99% power t o detect a relative risk of 1.[ADDRESS_612372] -donation  ED use by [CONTACT_477483] , using generalized 
estimating equations (GEE) accounting for repeated measurements, to estimate  whether odds of ED use differ 
by [CONTACT_477483] . We will use Poisson  regression to explore  count  of ED visits  among those who report 
having used these services  by [CONTACT_477483] , adjusting  for baseline characteristics, including demographic , 
socioeconomic, and health status at donation. We will explore the presence of effect modification and 
interaction between caregiving status and donor age, race/ ethnicity, and rurality . As a sub-aim, we will explore 
whether utilization differs by [CONTACT_6270] -reported physical, mental, and financial burden among caregiver donors . 
 
 
Aim 2. Power calculation. Goren  et al. demonstrated a significant difference in the proportion of Alzheimer’s 
caregivers experiencing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (8.1% for caregivers vs. 5.1 % for non -caregivers).[ADDRESS_612373] and a proport ion of 5 % experiencing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_477475] -caregiver group, we will have 99% 
power t o detect a relative risk of 1.[ADDRESS_612374] modification and interaction by [CONTACT_477484], ethnicity, and rurality , in addition to  exploring the role of self -reported burden 
in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_477476] . 
 
RESULTS  
Among 784 donors (median 10.4yrs post -donation), 148 (18.9%) identified as caregivers. Caregiver donors 
were older (62.6 vs. 57.9yrs, p< 0.001), more often female (69.6% vs. 58.3%, p=0.01), the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]’s spouse 
(50.0% vs. 7.9%) or parent (16.2% vs. 4.6%,  p< 0.001), and retired (38.4% vs. 24.9%, p=0.004), with no racial 
differences. Among those identifying as the caregiver and responding to the question about hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
(n=138), 71 (51.5%) reported having been admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_477477], compared to 237 (40.3%) 
among non -caregivers. Among those identifying as the caregiver and responding to the question about 
emergency room utilization since donation (n=144), 77 (53.5%) reported having been admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_477478], compared  to 305 (49.4%) among non -caregivers.

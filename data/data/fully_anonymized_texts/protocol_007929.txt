PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
Protocol Title A Multi Center, Randomized, Double -Masked, Active-Controlled, Comparative 
Clinical Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of MYL -1701P and Eylea® 
in Subjects with Diabetic Macular Edema  
Protocol 
Number  MYL -1701P -[ADDRESS_997819] diabetes mellitus and that approximate ly 7% of t hese ind ividuals are 
affected  by [CONTACT_730529].  
EYLEA® (aflibercept ) injection, an anti- Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor 
(VEGF) agent, has been approved by [CONTACT_730530] (DME). E ylea is bei ng marketed by [CONTACT_730531], Inc. in the US and [COMPANY_014] in EU.  
Mylan Inc. and Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. are dev elopi[INVESTIGATOR_730513] -1701P , a 
proposed biosimilar to  Eylea, and this study w ill serve to demonstrate the 
clinical similarity of MYL -1701P and Eyle a with r egard to efficacy, safety , 
pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity in the treatment of patients with DME. 
Primary 
Objectives  The primary objective is to demonstrate the clinical equivalence of MYL -
1701P  and Eylea  over [ADDRESS_997820] corrected visual acuity (BCVA).  
Primary 
endpoints  The primary efficacy endpoint will be the mean change from baseline in BCVA 
as assessed b y Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS)  letters at 
week 8.  
Methodology 
and treatments This is a multi -center, randomized, double -masked, active -controlled, 
comparative clinical study to demonstrate that no clinically meaningful 
differences ex ist betw een MYL -1701P and US -licensed Eylea in subjects with 
DME treated up to 52 weeks.  
Three hundred and twenty- four (324) eligible adult subjects with type 1 or 2 
diabetes mellitus wi th central DME involvement and BCVA between 73 and 38  
letters based o n ETDRS letters (20/40 – 20/200 Snellen equivalent) in the study 
eye and central retinal thickness (CRT) ≥ 300 µm, as determined by [CONTACT_730532] – optical coherence tomography (SD -OCT)  in the study eye , will be 
randomized 1:1 to intravitreal t reatment with MYL -1701P  or Eylea .  
 
 
 
 Randomization will be stratified based on 
Baseline BCVA, i.e., ETDRS letter scores 73 -55 vs. 54-38  and geographical 
region (US, EU, Japan and rest of the world) . 
At study week 8, th e primary endpoint  will be assesse d, and subjects will 
continue to receive the assigned treatment until Week 48. An end of study visit 
will be conducted at Week 52. Subjects  will receive intravitreal injections of 
MYL -1701P  or Eylea  throughout the 52-week tr eatment period, with planned 
doses at Stu dy Days 1, 29 (week 4), 57 (week 8), 85 (week 12), 113 (week 16), 
169 (week 24), 225 (week 32),  281 (week 40) and 337  (week 48). Additional 
doses may be administered at Week 20, Week 28, Week 36 and Week 44 based 
on the vis ual acuity, and /or SD-OC T as per the protocol specified criteria for 
administering additional [ADDRESS_997821] of the subjects may not require additional 4 -weekly doses.  
All subjects will return to clinic every 4 weeks for assessment of visual acuity 
(BCVA based on ETDRS letters) and central retinal thickness (CRT by 
[CONTACT_66309]-OCT) to a ssess ef ficacy and to guide treatment. There will be additional 
visits during the study as specified in the study schedule for safety an d 
pharmacokinetic evaluation.  
 
 
 
 
Immunogenicity w ill be assessed for all the subjects parti cipating in the study, 
through assessment of blood samples for anti-drug antibody  and neutralizing 
antibody throughout the study. Along with immunogenicity, free aflibercept 
concentration in the blood samples from a ll subjects will be determined to 
evaluate drug tolerance status. 
Pharmacokinetic (PK) sample s will be collected in patients identified for PK 
subpopulation (at least 32 in each study arm) . Subjects in the PK subpopulation 
will have to visit the sites for  2 additional visits for sampling ( visits V2 and 
V7A). 
Investigational 
Products  Test product: MYL -1701P (a proposed biosimilar to Eylea)  injection for 
intravitreal injection.

ratio to each arm  after allowing fo r approximately 10%  drop-outs .  
 
 
 
 
Statistical 
Methods  For the primary endpoint of change from baseline in BCVA at Week 8, the 
primary analysis will be based on a mixed model repeated measures analysis 
with ter ms for treatment, vis it, treatment by [CONTACT_23259], and region, 
together with baseline BCVA as a covariate.  
The within subject variance -covariance matrix will be assumed to be 
unstructured;  estimation will use restricted maximum likelihood, and the 
denomina tor degrees o f freedom will use the Kenward -Roger estimate. This 
model will provide an estimate, standard error, and 90% as well as 95% two-
sided CIs for the treatment difference at Week 8. If these CIs are fully 
contained within the interval ( -3, 3) then equivalence will have been 
demonstrated.  
The primary analysis will be performed on the Full Analysis Set and will 
include data from all visits regardless of whether the subject is still receiving 
study medication.  
Additionally,  sensitivity analysis of th e primary endpoint will be conducted,  in 
which BCVA values after discontinuing study medication will be excluded. 
Supportive analyses of the primary endpoint will also be produced based on the

2 INTRODUCTION  
2.1 Indication  
Mylan Inc., in collaboration with Momenta Pharmaceutica ls, Inc. is developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a proposed 
biosimilar version of Eylea® (aflibercept ). Eylea  was f irst approved in 2011 by [CONTACT_730534]-Related Macular Degeneration . 
Eylea (aflibercept)  is a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor  indicated for the 
following treatment s in the US and EU: 
• Neovascular (Wet) Age -Related Macul ar Dege neration (AMD) 
• Macular Edema Followin g Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO)  
• Diabetic Macular Edema (DME)  
Additionally, it is  indicated for Diabetic Retinopathy in Patients with DM E in the US and 
visual impairment due to my opic choroidal neovascularization in the E U. 
This study is being conducted by [CONTACT_730535] -1701P 
(a proposed biosimilar to Eylea , also referred to as  M710 ) and Eylea with reg ard to efficacy, 
safety , pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity in the treatment of patients with DME . 
2.[ADDRESS_997848] diabetes mellitus and th at 7% of 
these individuals are affe cted by [CONTACT_730536] a (Whiting DR, 2011; Ding  J et al ., 
2012 ). 
Anti-VEGF drugs are effective at improving vision in people with DME . Eylea  (aflibercept)  
confers some advantage over ranibizumab and bevacizumab in people with DME, at one year 
in both visua l and anatomic terms . (Virgili G  et al.,  2017 ). 
MYL -1701P is being developed as a proposed biosimilar t o Eylea  (aflibercept). Eylea  is a 
recombinant fusion protein consisting of portions of human VEGF receptors [ADDRESS_997849] for MYL-1701P-3001 is 
available  in the Single Reference Safety Document, which for this study is the MYL -1701P 
Investigator’s Brochure.  
Throughou t this study protocol, “ Eylea” refer s to US -licensed Eylea . 
2.2.1 Rationale for Study  
MYL -1701P is currently being developed by [CONTACT_456] (Mylan Inc.) in collaboration with 
Momenta Pharmaceuticals, that is being  formulated as a proposed biosimilar to Eylea  in 
accordance with European U nion (EU) and US Biosimilar guidelines.  (EMA 2014 , 
FDA  2015 ) 
This is a multi -center, rand omized,  double- masked, active -contro lled, comparative clinical 
study to demonstrate that no clinically meaningful differences exist between M YL-1701P and 
US-licensed Eylea in subjects with DME treated up to 52 weeks. 
It is part of the overall registration package to support the regulatory ap proval of MYL-1701P 
as a proposed biosimilar  to Eylea.   
Confidential Page 24 of 517
[IP_ADDRESS] Rationale for Study Population- Diabetic Macular Edema  
The active pharmacol ogic agent, in Eylea (aflibercept) , is understood to act as a soluble 
decoy receptor that binds to VEGF -A and PlGF, and there by [CONTACT_730537] -1 and VEGFR-2, which are expressed on the 
surface of endothelial cells. Activation through  VEGFR-1 and VEGFR- 2 is associated with 
neovascularization  and va scular permeability, while in hibition of activation by [CONTACT_730538] 
(aflibercept)  has been demonstrated to reduce both processes, with clinical benefit in the 
indicate d disorders. ( Eylea  US Package I nsert , 2017 ).  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
  
 
 
 
  
[IP_ADDRESS] Rationale for Subject Selection and Study Endpoints  
 
 
 
 
   
   
 
 
  
  
 
 
It is recognized that baseline visual acuity can be a factor  in tre atment response. In 
Dugel PU  et al., 2016, treatment response was analyzed by  c ategories of baseline BCVA for 
several anti -VEGF treatments, bu t with greatest focus on  trials of Lucentis. It was 
demonstrated that change in BCVA increased as baseline BCVA  decreased. Therefore, to 
reduce variability, randomization  will be stratified based on Baseline BCVA, i.e., ETDRS 
letter scores 73-55 vs. 54-38 an d geographical region (US, EU, Japan and rest of the world). 
(Dugel PU et al ., 2016 ) In addition, baseline BCVA is included as a covariate in the primary 
analysis.

differences between study treatments  (MYL -1701P and Eylea). 
2.3 Study Design 
This is a multi -center, randomized, double- masked, active-controlled, compar ative clinic al 
study between MYL-1701P and US- licensed Eylea in subjects with DME treated up to 52 
weeks.  
A total of 324  eligible adult subjects with type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus with central DME 
involvement and BCVA between 73 and 38 letters based on ETD RS letters  (20/40 – 20/ 200 
Snellen equivalent) in the study eye with CRT > [ADDRESS_997851],  in the 
study eye will be randomized 1:[ADDRESS_997852] s will continue to receive 
the assigned treatment until Week 48. An end of study visit will be conducted at Week 52.  
Subjects will receive intravitreal injections of either MYL -1701P or Eylea throughout the 
52-week treatment period, with planned doses at Study Day 1, Day 29 (week 4), Day 57 
(week 8), Day  85 (week  12), Day  113 (week 16), Day  169 (week 24), Day  225 (week 32), 
Day 281 (week 40) and Day 337 (week 48).  
In addi tion to the nine planned doses, study drug may also be administered at Week  20, 
Week  28, Week  [ADDRESS_997853]  at that 
visit and in accordance with the “c riteria for administering a dditional 4-weekly doses ” 
outlined in Section 5.1.2.  
B
oth US  Package I nsert  (USPI) and EU Summary of Product Characteristics ( SPC) for Eylea 
recommends intravitreal injection every 4 weeks (monthly) for the first 5 injectio ns followed 
by [CONTACT_730539] 8 weeks (2 months), USPI [INVESTIGATOR_730516] 4-
week (monthly) dosing in some subjects based on the need. However, SPC does not make 
any such recommendations for [ADDRESS_997854] satisfy the criteria outlined in Section 5.1.2 
and should also weigh the procedural risks related to intravitreal injection versus potential 
benefit. 
All subjects  will return to clinic every 4  weeks for assessment of visual acuity (BCVA based 
on ETDRS letters) and central retinal thickness (CRT b y SD- OCT) to assess efficacy and  to 
guide treatment. There will be additional visits during the study as specified in the study visit 
schedule for safety and pharmacokinetic evaluation.  
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_730540] (ETDRS Letter Sc ores 73-55 vs 
54-38) and geographical region (US, EU, Japan and Rest of the World).  
Confidential Page [ADDRESS_997855] 32 subjects in each study arm  will be included in the pharm acokinetic (PK) subset 
and PK  sampling will be done in these subject s as per the Study  Schedule ( Table 1 ). These 
subje cts will be enrolled from identified participating Investigator sites after voluntary 
consent for the same.  These subjects will be required to visit the study site for PK sampling 
for [ADDRESS_997856] , Eylea, could be reasonably 
assumed to be associated with MY L-1701P, and therefore considered expected for the 
purposes of expedited reporting to regulatory authorities and investigators. The excipi[INVESTIGATOR_730517]- 1701P are different from that of the E ylea formulation . Investigator 
should consider this difference between MYL-1701P and Eylea, while evaluating hi story of 
hypersensitivity to any of the excipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  
Confidential Page 27 of 517

However, because MYL -1701P has not yet been evaluated in clinical studies, investigators 
should carefully monitor for all adverse events, including those not described as ass ociated 
with Eylea and should promptly document and report th e adverse events as per the protocol.  
2.4.1 Safety Profile of Eylea 
A complete overview of the undesirable effects of E ylea can be found in the Eylea SPC and 
Eylea USPI . (Eylea SPC , 2017  and Eylea US  Package Insert , 2017 ). 
The adverse events of particular concern include bu t are not limited to : 
• Endop hthalmitis and retinal detachm ent fol lowing intravitreal injections: In such an 
event subject,  should be instructed to report any symptoms suggestive of 
endophthalmitis or retinal detachment withou t delay and should be managed 
appropriately.  
• Increases in intraocular pressure after  intravitreal injection.  
• Potential risk of a rterial thromboembolic events following intr avitreal use of VEGF 
inhibitors; these events will be classified  according to Hicks et al, [ADDRESS_997857] common adverse reactions (≥5%) reported in patients receiving E ylea were 
conjunctival hemorrhage, eye pain, cataract, vitreous floaters, intraocular pre ssure in creased, 
and vitreous detachment. 
As this is a therapeutic protein, there is a potentia l for immunogenicity with 
Eylea /MYL -1701P. Subjects should be instructed to report any signs or symptoms of 
intraocular inflammation, e.g. pain, photophobia, or redness, which may be a clinical si gn 
attributable to hypersensitivity.  
For any potential aller gic reaction after administration of study drug, diagnosis and 
assessment of anaphylaxis will be done using National Institute of Allergy and Infectious 
Disease and the Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network ( NIAID/FAAN ) criteria of 
anaphylaxis; the manageme nt of anaphylaxis should follow the standard institutional 
practices ( Appendix 11.1 ).

their future medical care by [CONTACT_44060].  
Every effort should be made to retain subjects in the study. When available, a reason for not 
completing the study  will be recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF).  
If, a subject discontinues from the study prematurely, due to any reason as provided in the below 
withdrawal criteria, the site should request the subject s’ consent for being follow ed-up during 
further study visits or at least until the Week 8 to perform safety and efficacy assessments as 
per the Study Schedule  (Table 1).  
A subject  may be required to terminate  study d rug for reasons including the following:  
• The subject withdraws consent.  
• For female subjects, diagnosis of pregnancy or stated intention to become pregnant. All 
efforts should be made by [CONTACT_103894], so that 
they are f ollowed until delivery or termination.

Reference T herapy, Dose, and Mode of Administration:  
Eylea is a sterile, clear,  and colorless to pale yellow solution. It is supplied as a 
preservative -free, sterile, aqueous solution in a single-use, glass vial designed to deliver 0.05 
mL (50 µL) of Eyl ea (40 mg/mL  in 10 mM sodium phosphate, 40 mM sodium chloride, 
0.03% polysorbate 20, and 5% sucrose). Eylea  will be sourced from the [LOCATION_002].  
5.1.[ADDRESS_997883] dose at 48 weeks.  
Subjects will receive intravitreal injections of MYL -1701P or Eylea throughout the 52-w eek 
treatmen t period, with planned doses at Study Day 1, Day 29 (week 4), Day 57 (week 8), 
Day 85 (week 12), Day  113 (week 16), Day  169 (week 24), Day  225 (week 32), Day  281 
(week 40) and Day  337 (week 48).  
In addition to the nine planned doses, study drug may also be administered at Week  20, 
Week  28, Week 36 and Week 44 based on the visual acuity, and/or SD- OCT at that  visit and 
in accordance with the “criteria for administering additional 4 -weekly doses” outlined in 
Section  5.1.2.  
5.1.[ADDRESS_997884] of the subj ects m ay not require additional 
4-weekly doses.  
5.1.3 Delayed and Missed Visits and/or Dose 
Every attempt should be done to c omplete the v isits and/or dosing with in the given window 
period for each scheduled visi t. The out of window drug administration should be recorded as 
a protocol deviation. 
If dose is given late for unavoidable reasons, the next scheduled dose should occur no sooner 
than three weeks after th e previous dose. The next dose should be scheduled s uch that it is as 
Confidential Page [ADDRESS_997885] 3 weeks apart f rom the 
previous dose. Investigators should ensure that the subj ects’ general clinical and the ocula r 
conditions are suitable for dosing prior to every dosing. 
If the visit is delayed until the start o f the window period of the next dose, the visit will be 
considered as a missed visit . 
The reasons for the delayed or missed visits and/or doses must  be documented in the patient’s 
study records and appr opriate section of the eCRF and all efforts shoul d be taken to 
administer the subsequent scheduled doses on time.  
5.1.[ADDRESS_997886] only be administered by a qualified person and the dosing regimen is 
expected to be the same as the cu rrent labeling for Eylea . Intravitreal injections  should not be 
performed if the pre -dose intra- ocular pressure is more than 30 mm Hg.  (Eylea  EU SPC, 
2017 ) 
The intravitreal inje ction procedure should be carried out under controlled aseptic conditions, 
which include surgical hand disinfection and the use of  steril e gloves, a sterile drape, and a 
sterile eyelid speculum (or equivalent).  
Adequate anesthesia and a topi[INVESTIGATOR_191285] –spect rum microbicide should be given prior to the 
injection.  The choice of the anesthetic age nt and the mic robicide can follow institutional 
practices.  The details of the pre -medication administered should be documented. 
Immediately following the intravitreal i njection, subjects should be monitored for elevation in 
intraocular pressure. If required, a sterile  paracentesis needle should be availa ble. 
Additionally , vision will be assessed post -injection by [CONTACT_730546]. 
Following intravitreal  injection, subjects should be instr ucted to report any symptoms 
suggestive of intraocul ar inflammatio n, endophthalmitis and/or retinal d etachment (e.g., eye 
pain, redness of the eye, photophobia, blurring of vision) without delay. 
If the subject reports any of these symptoms, Investigator w ill perform OE and appropriate 
investigations to con firm the diagn osis. Additional immunogenicity sampl es will be collected 
if subject has signs of intraocular inflammation , suggesting immune reaction . 
Each vial should o nly be used for the treatment of a s ingle eye. After injection, any unused 
product must be discarded. 
In the event of any significant dos ing errors, the CRO Medical Monitor, or designee should 
be contact[CONTACT_15608].

5.3 Study Medicat ion Complaints  
In the event of a complaint/concern during study participation, regarding the supplied study 
medication,  the site should contact [CONTACT_456]. Additional information and potentially the 
return of study medica tion may be requested by [CONTACT_730547].  The 
details of the complaint handling will be provided in an appropriate study manual. 
5.[ADDRESS_997888], will ensure that all 
investigational products are stored in a secured area under recommended storage conditions 
and in accordanc e with applicable regulatory require ments while at the investigator site.  
Study drug should be stored in accordance with the drug label. Storage conditions stated in 
the Investigator’s Brochure may be superseded by [CONTACT_4671].  
Temperature of storage  facilities should be monitored and recorded daily  using validated 
devices that record m aximum and mini mum temperatures. Should the storage facility 
experience any excursion of temperature outside of the labelled storage condition this must 
be reported imm ediately to Mylan or designee.  At si tes where daily monitoring and recording 
is not poss ible at weekend s, then on the next working day af ter the weekend the temperature 
record (e.g. , max/min thermometers) should be checked immediately for any temperature 
excursions. Devices used for temperatu re monitoring should be regularly calibrated. Affec ted 
material mu st be placed into quarantine until the impact of the excursion has been assessed 
and confirmed by [CONTACT_103897].  
The investigator must maintain adequate records  documenting the receipt, use, loss, or other 
disposition of the study drug.  If Mylan or CRO suppl ies drug accountability forms , these 
must be used. Alternatively , Mylan may approve use of standard institution forms. In either 
case, the forms must identify  the study drug, including batch or code numbers, and account 
for its disposition on a subject-by- subje ct basis, including specific dates  and quantities. The 
forms must be signed by [CONTACT_47510], and copi[INVESTIGATOR_730521] n or designee.  
At the end of the stu dy, Mylan will provide instructions as to dispositio n of any unused 
investigational product. If Mylan  authorizes destruction at the study site, the investigator 
must ensure that the materials are destroyed in compliance with applicable environmental 
regulat ions, institutional policy, and any special instructions provided by [CONTACT_103897].  Destruction 
must be adeq uately documented. 
5.5 Masking  
Considering the ophthalmology indication, the term “masking” has been used instead of 
“blinding” throughout the protocol. 
The study drug will be provided as glass vials and syringes.  
Masked pers onnel 
Confidential Page 41 of 517
Investigator will be masked throughout the study. Investigator /designee  will perform all study 
assessment s prior to and following study drug admini stration.  Investigator will also dec ide on 
the requirement of optional injections as nec essary.  
Unmask ed Personnel 
If an alternate ophth almologist is available at the site:  
An alternate ophthalmologist will be identified to be responsible for preparation  and 
administration of the study drug. Ophthalmologist administering the study drug will perform 
the po st injection procedures like measurement of IOP and any safety assessments up to 
[ADDRESS_997889] is  not available at the site ; and  a qualified u nmasked 
Pharmacist or Physician Assistant  is available at site : 
Incases, where the site does not have an alternate ophthalmologist, a qualified unmasked 
study personnel, i.e., unmasked pharmacist, physician assistant, will be identified to be  
responsible for the receipt, tracking, prepa ration and destruction of study drug. The identified 
qualified pharmacist/physician assi stant will prep are the drug and hand over the syringe to 
the masked Investigator for intravitreal  administration. Every effort should be taken to avoid 
any accidental u nmasking of masked study personnel du ring the process. The detailed 
instructions will be  given in a separate masking and unmasking plan.  
Every effort will be made to ensure that all other study site personnel other than those 
designated as unmasked, remain masked to treatment assignment.  
Masked and unmasked roles will be assumed for the enti re study  and, s witching from an 
unmasked to a ma sked role after the first subject is randomized at a site is not permitted. Any 
deviation to the roles above must be ap proved by [CONTACT_456], and properly documented 
before any subjects are treated. The Site  Signature [CONTACT_730583]. 
The central SD-OCT assessment, and central laboratory assessme nt, including safety, PK and 
immunogenicity, will be performed by [CONTACT_730548]. The complete det ails of the 
study personnel with their masking status will be maintained in the Mask ing and Unmask ing 
plan. 
The responsibilities of the Masked personnel are as follows:  
• Perform all screeni ng procedures up until randomization  
• Assess inclusio n/exclusion crit eria 
• Obtain medical , surgical , ophthalmic and smoking history  
• Obtain informed consent 
• Collect and process samples for laboratory testing  
• Acquire SD - OCT, fundus photography (FP), and fluorescein angiography (FA) 
images and transfer th em to reading centers  
• Acquire ECGs  
• Perform study  drug administration (when preparation of study drug is done by [CONTACT_730549], physician assistant at the site)  
Confidential Page 42 of 517
• Perform post- treatment safety assessments  (except for post injection proced ures like 
measurement  of IOP and any safety asses sments up to 30 minutes after the study drug 
administration) . 
• Decide on need for additional treatment, if any 
• Assess AE s, including severity and relationship 
• Perform complete OE  at all study visits  
• Evaluate all safety, including  review of images for safety  concerns at the site  
• Evaluate vital signs and ECGs; perform physical examinations  
• Test refraction and BCVA  
• Check IOP  
• Assess  SD - OCT, FP /FA. 
Responsibilit ies of the Unmasked Personnel are as follows:  
• Receipt, tracking, and destruction of study drug  
• Prepare study drug 
• Study drug administration and post injection procedures like measurement of IOP and 
any safety assessmen ts up to 30 minutes after the study drug administration  (when 
unmasked ophthalmologist i s identified at the s ite) 
Note: For patients in C zech Republic, additionally, the masked or unmasked ophthalmologist 
can monitor the patient for clinical signs and symptoms suggestive of adverse events  for at 
least [ADDRESS_997890]  Identification number (SID), randomization number and study 
medication, as well as site drug inventory control will be  managed by [CONTACT_730550]. A 
manua l containing complete instructions for Web or telephon e access and use will be 
provided to each sit e prior to study start. At their first clinic visit, the IXRS will assign a SID.  
Each SID will be unique and serve as t he primary subject identifier througho ut all phases of 
the study. The SID must appear on all CRF pages, source docu ments, laboratory data , ECG 
and diary data. Subjects qualifying to enter the study drug treatment phase, will be ass igned 
an additional “randomization number” by [CONTACT_730551]. 
For those patients added to the study as per section 7.[ADDRESS_997891] the old patients’ treatm ent. 
5.[ADDRESS_997892] is required by [CONTACT_730552] a 
medical emergency and when the  knowledge of the study treatment allocation is required for 
appropriate management of the medical event . Investigator should access the ‘Emergency 
Code break’ module in the IXRS system for breaking the m ask. The details of the procedure 
for “Emer gency Code break via Web ” are provided in the IXRS User Manual. In such 
situations, the randomization information will b e held by [CONTACT_394522](s), and the 
date and reason for breaking the mask  must be reco rded. The investigator should follow the 
study ’s rand omization procedures and should ensure that the code is broken only in 
accordance with the protocol. As the study is mask ed, the investigator should promptly 
document and explain to the sponsor any premature un mask ing (e.g., accidental un mask ing, 
Confidential Page 43 of 517
unmask ing due to a serious adverse event) of the investigation al product(s). Unmasking of 
treatment code for final da ta analysis will be done after database loc k. Unmasking process 
will be performed in accordance to both Sponsor’s and CRO’s unmasking SOPs, as detai led 
in the sta tistical analysis plan.  
In the event th at the mask  is broken for a subject by [CONTACT_737] , this subject is to be 
withdrawn from the study.  
5.8 Concomitant Medications  
All concomitant medications taken during the study (from signing informed consent to pos t-
study follow-up) must be recorded with indication, daily dose, frequency, and start and stop 
dates of administration in the CRF. All su bjects will be questioned about concomitant 
medication at each clinic visit and at follow up.  
Medications taken within 90 days prior to screening and prior to dos ing with study 
medication will be documented as a p rior medication. Any other important medica tions 
relevant to the treatment condition or the study treatment (e.g., prior treatment for DME) 
taken before the [ADDRESS_997893] ug (e.g. for safety reasons - see Section  4.3.3 ). 
Table 2: List  of P rohibited Treatment  
• Use of intraocular or periocular corticosteroids or other DME therapy in study eye  
• Antiangiogenic drugs for study eye (e.g., pegaptanib, bevacizumab, ranibizumab, 
aflibercept ) 
• Systemic antian giogenic drugs (e.g., bevacizumab, aflibercept)  
• Drugs that optimize (retinal) microcirculation e.g ., calcium dobesilate  
• Pan-retinal or macular laser photocoagulation  in the study eye for the treatment of DME  
• Systemic medications known to be toxic to the l ens, retina or optic nerve, including

ethambutol 
• Concurrent treatment with an investigational drug or de vice in the either eye  
• Any other medication/treatment which c an impact the v isual acuity or safety while on 
concurre nt treatment with aflibercept based on Investigator’s discretion . 
Permitted Medication  
Any medication other than the identified prohibited medications that were considered 
necessary for the subject’ s best interest and not expected to interfere with the safety or 
efficacy of the study drug can be given at the discretion of the Investigator. Investi gator is 
recommended to consult the Medical Mo nitor if he/she is u nclear on the impact of a 
concomitant medic ation on the  study endpoints. 
5.8.1 Study Eye  
Subjects w ill not be allowed to receive any medications (approved or investigational) for 
their DME in the study eye other than the study treatment (MYL-1701P or Eylea ), as 
Confidential Page 44 of 517
specified in the protocol, until they had completed the end of study (week 52) or early 
termi nation visit assessments. The prohibited medications should neither be admini stered 
locally (e .g., IVT, topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], juxtascleral, or periorbital routes), nor systemi cally, with the intent 
of treating the study eye. 
5.8.2 Fello w / Non -study Eye  
If the fellow eye ha d DME involving or threatening the center of the macula, requiring 
treatment, standard of care therapy can be administered, if necessary. All fellow eye 
treatment s must be recorded on the eCRF as a con comi tant medicat ion and/or procedure for 
the fellow eye . The fellow eye will not be considered an additional study eye. Subjects who 
receive  treatment for the fellow eye will  not be withdrawn from the study. Safety of the 
fellow eye should be monitored, an d all AEs collec ted. Other conditions in the fellow eye 
could be treated with approved therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. 
Immunogenicity and safety of subjects who received intravitreal anti- VEGF therapy in the 
fellow eye will be analyzed se parately and the analysis will be detai led in the statistical 
analysis plan. 
5.8.[ADDRESS_997894] t he nature, purpose, and risks of the study 
explained to them by [CONTACT_093]. They will be provided with a written copy of the 
informed consent form (ICF) for the study and give n sufficient time to  consider the study’s 
implications befo re deciding to p articipate.  A separate PK consent form will be provided to 
the subjects willing to participate in the PK subpopulation at the participati ng sites. Subjects 
agreeing to participate i n the study will sig n the ICF and be given a duplicate copy before 
undergoing any screening or pre- screening (if r equired) procedures. For every subject 
screened , a unique SID will be issued at the time of consent by [CONTACT_730553].   
Once a subject enrolls  in this study, the site will make every effort  to retain the s ubject for the 
planned duration of the study . Clinical study site staff are responsible for developi[INVESTIGATOR_103853]. Elements of this plan may include the followin g. 
• Thorough explanation of the complete clini cal study visits  schedule and procedural 
requirements d uring the informed consent process and re- emphasis at each clinic visit  
• A simple explanation of the key data and key time points that are crit ical for the study 's

of trained staff to co mple te in-person  contact [CONTACT_730555], the site should make every effort to regain contact [CONTACT_730556] y can appropriat ely be withdrawn from the study. All co ntact attempts 
should be documented in the subject's medical record. Should the subject continue to be 
unreachable, then and only then will he /she be considered t o have withdrawn from the study 
with a prim ary reason of "Lost to Follow- up." For all other subjects withdrawing from the 
study, an alternative reason for discontinuation should be recorded in the CRF. Regardless  of 
site plans to suppor t and retain subject s within the study, subjects may volunt arily withdraw 
from the study  for any reason and at any time.  
For a subject that completes the study and all procedures , it is anticipated that the duration of 
study would be up to 13 months (56 we eks).

Activities s pecific to this protocol are  expanded upon further below. 
6.3.[ADDRESS_997900] (e valuating Physician ) will be masked to wheth er the 
subject is receiving MYL -1701P or Eylea . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Ophthalmologic E xamin ation 
A study ophthalmologist (evaluating Physician ) will perform  a dilated eye examination of 
each eye of the  subj ect to establish that the ocular inclusion criteria are met and that non e of 
the ocular exclusionary conditions are present.  
Only one e ye wi ll be classified as study eye. Study eye will be de cided based on BCVA, CRT 
and other eligibility assessments at th e discretion of the masked  investigator. If both eyes are 
eligible, the study eye will be selected by [CONTACT_458] (masked). Once the study 
eye has been determined , it should rem ain the study eye throughout. If the fellow eye 
develops DME or if the condition of DME in the fellow eye worsens during the study, the 
fellow eye must not be considered as the study eye.  
The compl ete O E will include: 
Prior to Study Drug Administration  
Intraocular pressure:  
Intraocular pressure of the study eye will b e measured using standard devices (e.g., 
Goldmann applanation tonometry or Tono-pen™) . The same method of IOP measurement 
will be used  in each subject throughout the study. 
Indirect Ophthalmoscopy: 
Subjects' posterior pole and peripheral retina will be  examined by [CONTACT_314899]. 
Slit Lamp Biomicroscopy: 
Confidential Page 53 of 517
Subjects' ant erior eye structure and ocular adnexa will be  examined using a slit lamp.  
After Study drug administration: 
Finger Coun ting 
Vision will be assessed post -injection by [CONTACT_730561] c ounting fingers.  
Intraocul ar pressure:  
Intraocular pressure of the study eye will be measured using standard devices ( e.g., 
Goldmann applanation tonometry or Tono-pen™). The same method of IOP measurement 
will be used in each subject throughout the study. Intraocular pressure is me asured at 
approximately [ADDRESS_997901] 60 
minutes after the study drug administration.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  BCVA  
Visual acuity of the study  eye and fellow eye will be evaluated using the ETDRS protoco l at 
4 meters (further detailed in a separate visual acu ity testing protocol). 
Refraction and testing of visual acuity to fulfill study eligibility  criteria must be performed 
before the subject ’s eyes are dilated and before fundus photography and SD-OCT i f these 
procedures are to be carried out on the same day. Refraction must precede visual acuit y 
testing. A certified Visual Acuity Examiner must perform the standardized, ETDRS  visual 
acuity testi ng. The visual acuity examiner will be masked to the treatme nt assignment. All 
efforts should be made for the visual acuity examiner to have no knowledge of the study eye  
and have no ready access to the subje ct’s previous BCVA recorded. 
It is recommended that same Visual Acuity Examiner perform s VA throughout the study, 
specifically at baseline and Visit 5 (Week 8). 
A detailed protocol for conducting the VA testing and refraction wil l be provided as part of 
study procedure manual. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  SD-OCT/CRT  
Central retinal  thickness and other retinal characteristics will be evalu ated at scheduled visits 
using SD-OCT. The CRT will be m easured as central subfield thickness . 
An OCT of the study eye and fellow eye will be performed by a certified OCT Technician 
according to the standardized procedures described in separate  manual pr epare d for this 
study. OCT images for the study eye will be transmitted to an independent image readi ng 
center. All OCT im ages will be archived electronically at the study sites as part of the source 
documentation. OCT technicians will be certified to maintain quality and consistency. OCT 
technicians will be ma sked to the study drug assignment. 
At screening, for subject eligibility assessment, CRT will be assessed by [CONTACT_730562]-OCT images.  
At randomization, for assessment of continued eligibi lity of the subject, CRT reading by [CONTACT_730563].  
Similarly, for assessment of req uirement of additional 4- weekly doses as described in 
Section  5.1.2, the CRT read ing by [CONTACT_730564] b e use d. 
However, for efficacy analysis the central CRT reading of SD- OCT at all visits will be 
considered. 
Confidential Page [ADDRESS_997902] be performed after testing visual acuity if 
these procedures are carried out on the same day.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Fluores cein Angiography/ Fundus Photography  
The anatomical  state of the retinal vasculature of the study eye and fellow eye w ill be 
evaluated by [CONTACT_62872]/ FP at the screening visit  and end of study visit at Week 52. The FA/FP  from 
the screening visit (visit 1) will  be captured and transmitted to the central reading cent er for 
both eyes and reviewed before randomization for eligibility assessment . 
FA/FP images  from the end of study visit will be read by [CONTACT_100690], but the 
images must be transmitte d to the central reading center for archival.  
All FA/FP images will be archived electronically at the study sites as a part  of source 
documentation. 
Photography must be performed after testing visual acuity i f these procedures are to be 
carried out on the same  day. Fluorescein Angiography/Fundus Photography wi ll be done after 
other investigations including blood and urine sam ples are collected to avoid any interference 
from fluorescein . A detailed protocol for image acquisition and transmission will be pro vided 
in the study procedure manual. 
6.3.2 Safety Testing  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Event Assessment  
If subject reports  any symptoms before drug a dministration, they will be evaluated by 
[CONTACT_394530]. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_730522]-Investigator will be notified before dosing to  determine the course of action.  
Subjects will be routinely queried regarding the presence o r absence of adverse events using 
open ended questions.  The cl inic will provide documentation of any adverse even ts in the 
subject’s eCRF.  The adverse event source documentation will minimally include the 
following information:  date and time of assessment,  the outcome of the response, and 
identification of the clinic  staff member collecting the information.  
Arterial thromboembolic events following intravitreal use of  study drug will be classifi ed 
according to Hicks et al, 2018  by [CONTACT_730565] . 
For any potential a llergic reaction after administration  of study drug, diagnosis and 
assessment of anaphylaxis will be done  using NIAID/FAAN criteria of anaphylaxis; the 
management of anaphylaxis should follow the standard institutional practices 
(Appendix 11.1 )

Additionally, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time and INR will be do ne 
at screening.  For Czech Republic patients, additional tests of prothrombin time, activate d 
partial thromboplastin time and INR will be performed every three months (at Visit 6, 9, 12  
and 15) during the treatment period . 
Blood volumes to be collected and blood and urine sample handling instructions will be 
provided in the central vendor laboratory manual. The central laboratory will provide

[IP_ADDRESS]  Vital  Signs  
Vital signs include BP, pulse rate and temperature. B lood pressure will be measured after the 
subject was sitting for [ADDRESS_997903]’s arm supported at the level of the 
heart  and recorded to the nearest mmHg after [ADDRESS_997904]. Where possible, the same arm 
(preferably the dominant arm) will be used throughout the study. 
The same size blood pressure cuff, which h as been properly sized and calibrated, will be used 
to measure blood pressure each time.  The use of automated devices for measuring blood 
pressure (BP) and pulse rat e are acc eptable, although, when done manually, pulse rate will be 
measured in the brachial /radial artery f or at least 30 seconds.  Any clinically significant 
changes in blood pressure and pulse rate should be recorded as an AE. Determination of 
clinical si gnificanc e and seriousness will be based on the Investigator's medical judgment.

[IP_ADDRESS]  12-lead EC G 
In this study,  12-lead ECGs should be collected at times specified in the study schedule in 
Section  6.[ADDRESS_997905] s, a medic ally qualified individual at the site will assess ECG 
recor dings and make any comparisons t o baseline measurements. The ECG data  (QT interval, 
heart rate [ HR], QRS duration, PR and RR interval) will be recorded. 
In some cases, it may be appropriate to repe at abnormal ECGs to rule out improper lead 
placement as con tributing to the ECG abnormality . It is important that leads are placed in the 
same positions each time in order to achieve precise ECG reco rdings. Any clinically  
significant ECG abnormalities meas ured at screening should be assessed for their effects on 
subject eligibility of the study and recorded in medical history. Any clinical ly significant 
changes between the screening and subsequent ECG s sho uld be recorded as an AE. 
Determination of clinical significance and seriousness will be based on the Investiga tor's 
medical judgment.

PK subpopulation.  
6.3.4 Immunogenic ity Assessment  
The multi- tiered sample analysis recommendations for immunogenicity testing will be 
employed fo r the immunogenicity assessment.  (FDA 2016 ; Mire -Sluis AR  et al., 2004 ; 
Shankar G et al., 2008 )  
All samples designated for immunogenicity evaluation will undergo a screening assay to 
detect the presence of antidrug antibo dies (ADA) against aflibercept. Samples  identified as 
positive in the screening assay will then be tested in a confirmatory assay. Confirmed positive 
samples will be further evaluate d for antibody titer and the presence of neutralizing 
antibodies against aflibercept.  
Additionally, free af libercept concentration in all the ADA samples will be de termined to 
evaluate drug tolerance status.   
Confidential Page 57 of 517
Antidrug antibody, neutralizing antibody, and drug concentration analysis will use fully 
validated ana lytical methods. Bioanalytical methodology and procedures will be documente d 
in a sample analysis protocol. 
6.3.5 Blood Volume 
Blood samples will be collected for immunogenicity, drug tolerance and safety l aboratory 
investigations as detailed in Study Schedule ( Table 1). Additionally, blood samples will be 
collec ted for PK analysis in the subjects who are part of the P K subpopulation as specified in 
Study Schedule ( Table 1).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Immunogenicity Blood Sampling

7.2.5 Missing Data  
Missing data wil l not be imputed in the primary analysis of the primar y efficacy endpoint. 
Imputation techniques in sensitivity  analyses will be described in the SAP.  
In descriptive summaries and listings, no imputation will be employed. 
7.2.6 Sub-Group Analyses  
Subgroup analys es by [CONTACT_178814], age , gender, race, ethnic origin, and geographic 
region for key efficacy endpoints will be performed. Details will be provided in the  SAP. 
7.3 Secondary Endpoints  
7.3.1 Efficacy  
The key sec ondary efficacy endpoint is 
• The mean change from baseline in CRT as determined b y SD -OCT over time  
Only the ce ntral CRT reading of all the SD-OCT images across visits will be used for 
efficacy analysis.  
The other secondary efficacy endpoints will include: 
• The mean change in BCVA over time  
• Proportion of subject s who gained ≥15 letters  from baseline in BCVA, assessed in 
change from baseline in ETDRS letters over time  
• Number of administrations of study drug required 
The proportion of subjects who gained ≥15 l etters from baseline in BCVA at wee ks 1, 4, 8, 
12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48 and 52 will be presented by [CONTACT_3148]. For each time 
point, the summary table will present the number of subjects in each treatment, th e 
proportions by [CONTACT_3148], the difference in proportions, and the 95% CI for the differenc e. 
These estimates will be unadjusted for covariates. 
The number of administrations of study drug required over the treatment period will be 
descriptively summarized.  
The other secondary efficacy endpo ints will be analyzed in a similar  manner as the primar y 
efficacy endpoint. 
All analyses will be performed on the FAS and the PP Population. 
7.3.2 Safety  
Safety will be assessed over time, based on the following evaluations:  
• Ocular (study and fellow eye) and non- ocular adverse events (AE)  
• Vital signs 
• Physical examin ations performed  
• Complet e OE  
• Safety labs ( Serum  chemistry, hematology and urinalysis)

The investigator must obtain in writing the sponsor’s agreement to dispose of any re cords, 
even if the ret ention period has been reached. 
8.6 Confidentiality  
Information furnished to Clinical Investigators and IRBs/Ethics Committees will be 
maintained in confidence by [CONTACT_103918]/Ethics Committee.  By [CONTACT_103919],  the Investigator affirms to the Sponsor that he/she will maintain, in confidence , 
information furnished to the IRB/Ethics Committee relevant to this study under appropriate 
understanding of confidentiality with such IRB/Ethics Committee.  
By [CONTACT_730573], the Investig ator agrees that within local regulatory restrictions and 
institutional and ethical considerations, the Sponsor may consult and/or copy source 
documents (e.g., laboratory/X-ray reports, ECG tracings, workbooks, medical records)  in 
order to verify CRF data.

being conducted as well as the country where the study will be submitted. 
8.7.[ADDRESS_997918]/Ethics Commi ttee 
The Investigator is responsible for obtaining initial and continuing review (at in tervals not 
more  than once per year) o f the study by [CONTACT_2717]/Ethics Committee, or in accordance with 
applicable government regulations of the country where the study is being conducted as we ll 
as the country where the study will be submitted. This study will not enroll  any subjects until 
the IR B/Ethics Committee provides written approval of the protocol and the informed 
consent to the investigator.  In addition, a copy of t he IRB/Ethics Committee approval 
documents must be provided to the sponsor prior to enrolling any subjects into the study. 
8.7.[ADDRESS_997919] of investigational sites, IEC(s)/IRB(s ) appro vals, 
as well as oth er relevant documentation will be submitted to the local Regulatory Authorities 
for review and approval prior to study  start.  Upon completion, the Regulatory Authorities 
will be notified the study has ended. The study will only be undert aken in compliance with 
the local regulatory requirements.  
Confidential Page [ADDRESS_997920] (e.g., IRB or et hics committee) and the Sponsor and/or 
its agent for review and approval prior to the start of the study.  The i nvestigator shall provide 
a copy of the signed and dated informed consent to the subject, and a signed and dated copy 
shall  be maintained in the volunteer’s medical record.  
8.[ADDRESS_997921](s) will be reported as outlined in this section. 
Subjects will be provided a study diary to c apture adverse even ts in between the visits. The 
Investigator/designee will review information recorded in the study diary  during the visits.  
Study diary will be collected back from the Subject prior to study completion or early  
termination.  
The Investigator must pursue and obtain information adequate both to determine the outc ome 
of all AEs and to assess whether it meets the  criteria for classifi cation as an SAE requiring 
immediate notification to Mylan. The Investigator is required to assess causali ty an d should 
obtain suff icient information to determine the causality of all AEs. All AEs will be followed 
until the event is resolved, deemed to be stable, or until the event is found to be due to 
another known cause (concurrent condition or medication) and cl inical judgment ind icates 
that further evaluation is not warranted with the sponsor concurring with that ass essment.  
9.[ADDRESS_997922]. An AE can therefore be a ny unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including a new, clinically important abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or dise ase, 
temporal ly associated with drug administration, whether or not related to the product. 
The above definition covers also cases of  
• Exacerbation of pre-existing diseases or conditions. 
o Pre-existing diseases or conditions will not be considered AEs unless there is 
an increase in the fre quency or severity, or a change in the quality of the 
disease or condition.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the cl inical sequelae of a s uspected drug-drug or drug-food 
interaction.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study 
treatment or a concomitant medication. Overdose per se  will not be reported as an 
AE/SAE unless this is an intentional overdose t aken with possible suicidal/self -
harming intent; this should be reported regardless of sequelae. 
 
An AE will be  defined as a treatm ent-emergent adverse event (TEAE) if the first onset (or 
worsening, in the case of pre- existing disease ) is after the first a dministration of MYL -1701P 
or Eylea  after randomization through EOS/ET .  
AEs should be categorized as those rel ated to the Study eye, fellow  eye and systemic AEs.  
AEs reported from subjects receiving Anti -VEGF treatment in fellow  eye will be separately 
reported. 
9.2.[ADDRESS_997923] related to any dose of the 
investigation products should be considered adverse drug reactions (ADRs). The phras e 
“responses to an investigational product” means that a causal relationship between an 
investigational product and an AE is at least a reasonable possibility. All AEs judged by 
[CONTACT_309960] [ADDRESS_997924] will be designated as ADRs.  
All AEs, with the causal relationship to the study drug reported as “possible”, “probable” or 
“definite” will be considered ADRs. If the relationship to the study drug is not given, then the 
AE must be treated a s if the relationship were “possible.”  
9.2.3 Unexpected Adverse Event/Adverse Drug Reaction  
An unexpected AE or ADR is defined as one whose nature or severity is not consistent with 
the applicable reference safety information designated for the study. For exampl e, hepatic 
necrosis would be unexpected (greater severity) if the IB only listed elevated hepa tic 
enzymes or hepatitis. Likewise, cer ebral thromboembolis m and cerebral vasculitis would be 
unexpected (greater specificity) if the IB only listed cerebral vasc ular accidents.  
The re ference safety document is the Investigator’s Brochure  for MYL -1701P. For Eylea  and 
any concomitant medication, the respective SmPC  or US prescribing information  will be the 
reference safety document.  
9.2.[ADDRESS_997925] medical occurrence that at any dose: 
• Results in death.  
• Is life -threatening. 
o NOTE: The term “ life-threatening ” in the defin ition of “serious” refers to an 
event in which the subject  was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not 
refer to an event which hy pothetically might have caused death if it were more 
severe.  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/in capacity. 
• Is a congenital anomaly. 
o NOTE: A congenital anomaly  in an infant born to a mother who was exposed to 
the study drug during pregnancy is considered an SAE. However, a newly 
diagnosed pregnancy in a subject that has received the study drug is not 
considered an SAE unl ess it is suspected that the study drug interacted with a 
contraceptive method and led to the pregnancy. The subject with new ly diagnosed 
pregnancy will discontinue receiving study treatment and will be followed -up 
every 3 months until d elivery or terminat ion to gather information about the 
outcome of the pregnancy.  
• Is an important medical event.  
o NOTE: Important Medical Event:  Medical and scientific judgment should be 
exercised in deciding whether it is appropriate to consider other sit uations serious, 
such as important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or 
result in death or hospit alization but may jeop ardize the subject and / or may 
require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition 
above. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or 
at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not 
result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
o For this protocol, any cancer, includi ng localized basal cell carcinoma, is 
considered an important medical event, to be reported as a SAE. 
• Requires inpatient hosp italization or prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
o NOTE: Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_394491] 24 hours in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_730524]. Events NOT  to be reported as SAEs are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_43716]:

requested from the Investigator to provide clarity and understanding of the event in th e 
context of the clinical study .

Investigator will then monitor and/or ask about or evaluate AEs using non- leading  questions, 
such as  
o “How are you feeling?” 
o “Have you experienced any issues since your last visit?”  
o “Have you taken any new medic ations since your last visit?”  
Any clinically relevant observations made by [CONTACT_730575] e visit will also be 
considered AEs.  
The subject ’s diary should also be reviewed at each study visit for adverse events. W hen 
study di aries are issued, subjects will be appropriately educated by [CONTACT_730576] 
a timely manner.

9.3.2 Evaluation 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Severity Assessment of Adverse Events  
The clini cal severity of an A E will be graded using the NCI-CTCAE Criteria Version 4.03. A 
copy of these criteria will be provided t o each study  site. If an AE is not listed in the CTCAE, 
its clinical severity will be classified as follows:  
Table 6: Clinical Se verity of Adverse Events 
The Investigator will use the terms defined below to describe the maximum inte nsity of the AE.  
Grade 1 – MILD  Does not interfere with subject 's usual function  
Grade 2 – MODERATE  Interferes to some extent with  subject 's usual fun ction  
Grade 3 – SEVERE Interferes significantly with subject 's usual function  
Grade 4 - LIFE -THREATEN ING Risk of death at time  of event  
Grade 5 – DEATH  Death related to AE  
If an AE is graded 4 or 5 according to the above criteria, t hen the AE meets the criteria for an 
SAE and the Investigator should immediately notify the sponsor or designee as described i n 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS] . 
It is important to distinguish between severe AEs and SAEs. Severity is a classifica tion of 
intensity based on the CTCAE grading o r on the above table, whereas an SAE is an AE that 
meets any of the regulatory specified criteria req uired for designation as seriousness 
described in Section  9.2.4 . 
Confidential Page 70 of 517
[IP_ADDRESS]  Action Taken  
The possible actions taken for an AE are described in  Table 7. 
Table 7: Action Taken  for an Adverse Event  
Treatment interrupted  The treatment was tempo rarily interrupted  
Treatment withdrawn  The treatment was permanently discontinued  
Unknown  Not known, not observed, not recorded, or  refused  
No action taken  The AE did not require any int ervention  
Not applicable  AE occurred after study medication was pe rmanently withdrawn or 
subject  completed the treatment period  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Outcome at the Time of Last Observation  
For all adverse events, the in vestigator must purs ue and obtain information adequate both to 
determine the outcome of the adverse event and to assess whe ther it meets the criteria for 
classification as a serious adverse event requiring immediate notification to S ponsor or its 
designated representative . 
• The outcome at the time of last observ ation will be classified as:  
• Recovered/resolved  
• Recovered/resolved with sequelae  
• Recovering/resolving 
• Not recovered/not resolved  
• Fatal*  
• Unknown 
All ongoing AEs without fatal outcome (i.e., did not ca use death) will be r ecorded as not 
recovered/not resolved  at the time of death.  
*Only select fatal as an outcome when the A E results in death. If more than one AE is 
possibly related to the subject ’s death, the outcome of death should be indicated for the A E 
which is the most  plausible cause of death in the opin ion of the Investigator.  
Note:  although “fatal” is usually an eve nt outcome, events such as sudden death or 
unexplained death should be reported as SAEs.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Causality Assessment of Adverse Events  
For all adverse events, sufficient information should be obtained by [CONTACT_730577]. The investigator is required to assess causality 
of each AE.  
An Investigator’s causality assessment is the determination of w hether there exists a 
reasonable possibility that the inv estigational product caused or contributed to an AE. The 
Investiga tor must make an assessment of the relationship of each AE (serious and 
non-serious) to the study treatment(s) and record this relati onship in the CRF. 
In addition, if the Investigator deter mines an AE or SAE is associated with the protocol 
specified study  procedures, the Investigator must record this information about the causal 
relationship in the source documents and CRF, as appropriate, and report the assessment in 
accordance with the rep orting requirements, as applicable, AE or SAE. 
Factors that need t o be considered when making a causality assessment include:  
• Temporal relationship (e.g., time of onset) 
Confidential Page 71 of 517
• Clinical and pathological char acteristics of the event(s)  
• Pharmacological plausibility  
• Exclusion of confounding factors (medical and medication history) 
• Drug Interactions 
• De-challenge/re -challenge 
• Dose relationship  
A suspected relationship (definite, probable, and possible) between the events and the study 
medication means, in general, that  there are facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal 
relationship. Receipt of additional or clarifying information may warrant reassessmen t of 
causality. The Investigator is responsible for assessing relationship of AEs t o study treatment 
in accord ance with the following definitions  (Table 8): 
Table 8: Definition of Suspected Relationship between the Events and Study  Medication  
DEFINITELY Causal relationship is certain  F or Example: th e tem poral relationship between 
drug exposure and the adverse event (AE) 
onset/course is reasonable, there i s a clinically 
compatible response to de -challenge, other causes 
have been eliminated; the event must be definitive 
pharmacologically  or phenomenolo gical ly, using a 
satisfactory re -challenge procedure if necessary.  
PROBABLY  High degree of certainty for 
causal relationship  For Example: the temporal relationship between 
drug exposure and AE onset/course is reasonable, 
there is a clinical ly compatible r espon se to de -
challenge (re -challenge is not required), and other 
causes have been eliminated or are unlikel y. 
POSSIBLY  Causal relationship is 
uncertain  For Example: the temporal relationship between 
drug exposure and the AE onset/course is  
reasonable or unkno wn, de -challenge information 
is either unknown or equivocal, and while other 
potential causes may or ma y not exist, a causal 
relationship to study drug does not appear probable . 
UNLIKELY  Not reasonabl y related 
although a causal relatio nship 
cannot be  ruled out  For Example: Event or laboratory test abnormality, 
with a time to drug intake that makes a relati onship 
improbable (but not impossible), or disease or other 
drugs provide plausible explanations . 
UNRELATED/NOT 
RELATED No possible relationship  Th e tem poral relationship between drug exposure 
and the AE onset/course is unreasonable or 
incompatible, or a causal relationship to study drug 
is impossible . 
 
If the relationship to the study treatment(s) is considered to be unlikely or not 
related/unrelat ed, an alternative suspected etiology should preferably be provided (e.g., 
concomitant medications, intercu rrent condition) wherever applicable and available.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Documentation  
All AEs occurring within the period of observation for the study must be documented in the 
CRF with the following information; where appropriate:  
• AE name [CONTACT_730584] 
• When the AE first occurred (start date and time); SAE start date is defined as the dat e 
the AE became serious  
• When the AE stopped (stop date and time or date and time of last observation if 
ongoing, i.e., recovering or not recovered) 
Confidential Page 72 of 517
• Severity of the AE 
• Seriousness criteria (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], death, etc.)  
• Action taken with study medication as a result of AE  
• Outcome

[IP_ADDRESS]  Treatment of Adverse Events  
AEs that occur during the study will be treated, if necessary, by [CONTACT_214717]. 
If such treatment constitutes a deviation from the protocol, the reason s hould be documented 
in the CRF; this can include temporary interruption of study treatment. The decision about 
whether the subject may resume the study treatment will be made by [CONTACT_394557]/or medical monitor.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Follow-up 
Any AE will be followed-up to a satisfactory resolution, until it becomes stable, or until it ca n 
be explained by [CONTACT_17648] (i.e., concurrent condition or medication) and clinical 
judgment indicates that further evaluation is not warrant ed. All findings  relevant to the final 
outcome of an AE must be reported in the subject ’s medical record and recorded on th e 
appropriate CRF page.  
New information  and any important missing information from prior reports  on a SAE must  be 
provided promptly t o the study sponsor. In addition, the Investigator may be requested by 
[CONTACT_103897]/designee to obtain specific additional follow -up information in an expedited fashion. 
The investigator should respond to targeted follow-up requests as soon as possible and no 
later than [ADDRESS_997928].  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Notification  
For SAEs, the active reporting period to Mylan, begins from the time that the subject  
provides informed consent, which is obtained prior to the subject ’s participation in the study, 
i.e., prior to u ndergoing any study- related procedure and/or receiving investigational product, 
through and including the follow up visit. Should an Investigator be made aware of any SAE 
occurring any time after the active reporting period, the SAE must be promptly repo rted to 
Mylan onl y in case of reasonable causality (i.e. suspected ADR).  
The SAE reporting form  is to be completed for all s erious adverse events, signed by [CONTACT_3786], and emailed or faxed with supporting documentation (e.g., CRFs, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2553], l aboratory repor ts). Subject  identity details (such as but not limited to name [CONTACT_394561]/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7965]) must not be visib le on SAE forms or any supporting documentation 
provided by [CONTACT_737]. These should be “blacked out” and replaced with the site and 
subject ’s study identification number on every page. 
At that time of first notification, the Investigator/designee s hould provide the following 
information via the SAE report form:  
• Protocol number 
• Reporter ( study site and Investigator)  
• Subject’s uni que identificati on number  
• Subject ’s age  
• Investigational medicinal product  
• Date of first dose of study  treatment  
• Date of l ast dose of study  treatment, if applicable  
• SAE term  
Confidential Page 73 of 517
• The seriousness criteria that were met  
• Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_730526]  
• Severity  
• Start and stop (if applicable) of the event (date and time)  
• A brief description of the eve nt, outcome to date, and any actions taken 
• Concomitant medication at onset of the event 
• Relevant past history information  
• Relevant lab oratory test fin dings 
If the initial notification of an SAE is by [CONTACT_756], within [ADDRESS_997929] be submitted as soon as possible to Mylan.  
Any missing or additional relevant information concerning the SAE should be provided on a 
follow -up SAE Report Form. Ensure that any additional  information requested by [CONTACT_394545], as outlined above (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_73529], autopsy report) is 
provided to the sponsor as soon as it is available. 
Sponsor Contact [CONTACT_730578] 24 hours by [CONTACT_6968] (preferred) or fax  to:

[IP_ADDRESS] Regulatory Reporting  
All AEs, including suspected serious unexpected AEs will be reported in accordance with 
applicable local regulations. The Investigator is re quired to comply with applicable 
regulations (including local law and guidance) regarding notification to her/his regulatory 
authorities, ethics committees (ECs) and institutions.  
Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs),  SAEs and other cases required by 
[CONTACT_730579]’s 
representative to all concerned parties within the prescribed timeframe. The sponsor or 
representative will also submit periodic safety reports (for e.g., De velopment Safety Upda te 
Reports) as required by [CONTACT_59761]. 
9.[ADDRESS_997931] be followed until a final outcome is determined (e.g., 
parturition, spontaneous or scheduled termination). 
Confidential Page [ADDRESS_997932] Safety and Risk Management 
within 24 hours from the time of initial knowledge, even if beyond the closure of the clini cal 
database.  
While pregnancy itself is no t considered an AE or SAE, any pregnancy complication or 
elective termination of a  pregnancy for medical reasons will be recorded as an AE or an SAE. 
A spontaneous abortion is always considered to be a SAE and will b e reported to the s ponsor 
within 24 hours of knowledge of the event. 
Elective termination (i.e., without medical reasons) of an uncomplicated pregnancy is 
considered to be an elective procedure and not an AE, nevertheless, Mylan requests that t he 
outcome ( e.g., elective term ination) be reported within 24 hours and sent as a follow-up on 
the Delivery and Infant Follow -up Form).  
The Investigator is also responsible for following up the pregnancy at 3 monthly interva ls 
until delivery or termination, informin g the sponsor about its outcome.  
9.4.2 Overdose, Medication Errors and Other Events  
Overdose, per se  of either study treatment or  a concomitant medication will not be reported as 
an AE; unless it is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self -harmi ng intent. 
Signs, sy mptoms, and clinical sequelae associated with intentional overdose are to be 
recorded on the AE CRF pag e. Dosing and other medication errors are to be recorded as 
protocol deviations. 
9.4.[ADDRESS_997933] unexpectedly worsened in severity or frequency or changed in nature at  
any time during the study.  
When recording an unanticipated worsening of study eye DME on the Adverse Event eCRF, 
it is impor tant to convey the concept that the condition has changed by [CONTACT_13665] (e.g., “accelerated DME”). Events that are clearly consiste nt with the expected 
pattern of progression of the underlying disease should not be recorded as AEs. In cases of 
ocular inflammation, diagnoses terms like iritis, iridocyclitis, vitritis, endophth almitis or 
uveitis should be used. 
9.[ADDRESS_997934] Findings  
Abnormal laboratory fi ndings per se (e.g., clinical chemistry, hematology) or other abnormal 
assessments  (e.g., ECG, X-rays, and vital signs) are not reported as AEs. However, abnormal 
findings that are deemed clinically significant or are associated with s igns and/or symptoms 
must be recorded as AEs if they meet the definition of an AE (and recorded as an S AE if they 
Confidential Page 75 of 517
meet the criteria of being serious). Clinically significant abnormal laboratory or othe r 
abnormal findings that are detecte d after study drug administration or tha t are present at 
baseline and worsen following the administration of study drug ar e included as AEs (and 
SAEs, if serious). The Investigator should exercise his or her medical judgme nt in deciding 
whether an abnormal laboratory finding  or other abnormal as sessment is clinically 
significant. Broad guidance for determining whether an abno rmal objective test finding 
should be reported as an AE follows:  
• The test result is associated with accompanying symptoms and/or  
• The test result require s additional diagnost ic testing or medical/surgical intervention 
and/or 
• The test result leads to a chan ge in study dosing (outside of protocol-stipulated dose 
adjustments)  or discontinuation from the study , additional concomitant drug 
treatment, or other t herapy; and/or 
• The te st result is considered to be an AE by [CONTACT_394548]. 
 
Repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of any of the above conditions, does not constit ute 
an AE.  
Any abnormal test result determined by [CONTACT_730580].

or both (e.g ., generalized hives , pruritus or flushing, swollen lips -tongue -uvula) AND AT 
LEAST ONE OF THE FOLLOWING : 
a. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798]  (e.g., dys pnea, wheeze -bronchosp asm, stridor, reduced 
PEF, hypoxemia)  
b. Reduced BP or associated symptoms of end -organ dysfunction  (e.g. , hypotonia 
[collapse], syncope, incontinence)  
2. Two (or more) of the following that occurred rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375] (minutes to several hours) afte r

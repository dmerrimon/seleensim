Template ID: COM -I00205 Rev: 2.[ADDRESS_1051753] market study assessing the safety 
and efficacy of Nerivio for the treatment of migraine in children under the age of 
12 
Investigational 
Device  Nerivio is an FDA -approved remote electrical neuromodulation (REN) device for 
the acute  and/or preventive treatment of migraine with or without aura  in patients 
12 years of age or older.   
Nerivio  delivers transcutaneous electrical stimulation to the upper arm to induce 
conditioned pain modulation (CPM) that activates a descending endogenous 
analgesic mechanism. The treatment is self -administered and controlled by a 
smartphone application.  
Objectives  The study assess ed the safety and efficacy of Nerivio for acute treatment of 
migraine in children under the age of [ADDRESS_1051754] treatment  
Inclusion 
Criteria  • Prescribed with Nerivio device for the treatment of migraine  
• Age under [ADDRESS_1051755] Nerivio treatment  
• Treat with Nerivio at least onc e 
Exclusion 
Criteria  • Treatments shorter than 30 minutes  
Study Design  A prospective, data analysis of users that met the inclusion criteria was 
performed. All data that were reported prior and following the treatments by [CONTACT_766928].   
Primary 
endpoint  - 
Safety  Rate of Device Related Adverse Events  
Incidence of device -related adverse events (DRAEs) reported by [CONTACT_1766].  
a) Percentage of patients reporting DRAEs  
b) Severity of reported DRAEs

Template ID: COM -I00205 Rev: 2.[ADDRESS_1051756] 50% of all their treatments.  
 
Consistent Freedom from Headache at [ADDRESS_1051757] 50% of all their  treatments . 
 
Freedom from a specific migraine associated symptom.  
Freedom from a specific migraine associated symptom was calculated as the 
percent of patients reporting the presence of that symptom at baseline, and the 
lack of that symptom at [ADDRESS_1051758] 50% of all their  
treatments .  
Per the ICHD -3, migraine associated symptoms are:  
a) Hyper s ensitivity  to light (phonophobia)  
b) Hyper sensitivity to sound (phonophobia)  
c) Nausea (with or without vomiting)  
 
Functional disability relief  
Functional disability relief was calculated as decrease of at least one level of 
functional disability from baseline to 2-hours post -treatment  in at least 50% of all 
their treatments . 
Disability levels are (0) none (full function), (1) mild disability , (2) moderate  
disability , and (3) severe  disability .  
 
Freedom from functional disability  
Freedom from functional disability was calculated as decrease from any 
disability level (3,  2, or 1) at baseline to no disability (i.e., return to full function) 
at 2-hours post -treatment  in at least 50% of all their  treatments . 
 
Exploratory 
efficacy 
endpoints  Use of migraine medications  
Treatment patterns of Nerivio use as a standalone treatment vs. in combination 
with medications were extracted from the [ADDRESS_1051759] -treatment reports, as the 
percentage of treatments in which no rescue headache medications were used 
(Nerivio standalone), or Nerivio was used with over -the-counter (OTC) 
medications, or with prescription medications (Rx).  
 
Nerivio t reatment stimulation i ntensity  
Treatment intensity (stimulation current) is set by [CONTACT_766929]. The average intensity over all treatments per 
patient was calculated to provide personal intensity levels, which was used for 
the analyses. Average personal intensity levels and the range for 80% of the 
users were calculated over the patient cohort.  
 
Nerivio utilization   
Average (and/or median) o f number of Nerivio treatments per month . A specific 
cohort of this outcome considers safety in patients who use the device at high 
frequency, close to the every -other -day regime of preventive treatment.

Datasets  1. Intent to treat analysis set (ITT)  
The ITT analysis set includes all users who had at least one treatment   
 
2. Modified intent to treat analysis set (mITT)  
The mITT analysis set includes all ITT participants who had at least 2 
treatments with prospective electronic diary reports  at the beginning of the 
treatment (“baseline”) and [ADDRESS_1051760] the beginning of the treatment.  
Data Analysis  The ITT analysis set was u sed for the safety assessments and the mITT 
analysis set was used for the efficacy assessments.  
 
 
STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR RWE -009 STUDY  
The study hypothesis was that treatments  of migraine  with the Nerivio device in children 
will be as safe and effective as previously described in adolescents  and adults.  
 
DATA COLLECTION  
BASELINE DATA  
Baseline participant characteristics  (age, gender)  were collected from the Nerivio account 
of each participant.  
TREATMENT DATA   
Treatment data was retrieved from the Nerivio app  for each treatm ent. Data includes 
automatic parameters  (e.g time of treatment, location, device serial number, treatment 
intensity etc …) and individual information completed by [CONTACT_2299] (pain level before 
and after the treatments, migraine symptoms, functional disability before and after the 
treatment etc …) 
COMPUTER SOFTWARE  
All statistical analyses and data presentations, including tabulations and listings, were 
performed using the SAS  version 9.[ADDRESS_1051761] deviation, minimum, median and maximum and categorical variables 
by a count and percentage.  
 
Safety Endpoints Analysis  
The rate of device rela ted adverse event  (DRAE) was calculated ad the number of reported 
DRAE divided by [CONTACT_766930] . 
 
Efficacy Endpoints Analysis  
All the endpoints will be calculated for Qualified Attacks only, Qualifies treaterent was 
defined as  
[ADDRESS_1051762] 30 minutes  
2 – Pre and post treatment data wasreported by [CONTACT_766931]  
3 – No rescue medications  were taken before and during the [ADDRESS_1051763] two  qualified  treatments  were 
performed. Patients who experienced the  outcome (e.g., pain freedom) in at least 50% of 
their reported treatments, during which they did not report  the use of rescue medications, 
were considered responders.  
Headache pain and functional disability  were rated at baseline and at [ADDRESS_1051764] ‐treatment 
on a 4‐point scale: severe, moderate, mild, or none. Migraine  associated  symptoms 
(photophobia, phonophobia, and  nausea/vomiting) were marked as present or not.  
Pain relief was calculated as a decrease from severe or  moderate levels at baseline to mild 
or none at 2 h posttreatment.  
Functional disability relief was calculated as  any improvement in disability from baseline to  
2 h posttreatment.   
Pain/functional disability freedom was calculated  as a decrease from  any pain/disability 
level at baseline to none at [ADDRESS_1051765] ‐treatment.  
Freedom from a  specific migraine‐associated symptom was calculated as  the percentage 
of patients reporting the  presence of that  symptom at baseline and the lack of that 
symptom at  [ADDRESS_1051766]‐treatment. Freedom from at least one associated  symptom was 
calculated as the percentage of  patients in  which one or more associated symptom(s) were 
reported at baseline and the  lack of at least one of those symptoms  at [ADDRESS_1051767] ‐treatment.

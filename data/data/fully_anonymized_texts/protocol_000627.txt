Confidential Information   Global Amendment 1: 29 January 2020  SUMMARY OF CHANGES – VERSION 2.0 ( GLOBAL AMENDMENT 1), JANUARY  
2020  
RATIONALE  
This amendment serves to clarify that investigator judgement is the foundation of reporting 
adverse events (AEs) associated with out -of-range laboratory values.  It is recognized that IGF -1 
and IGFBP3 are pharmacodynamic markers for TransCon hGH therapy an d may be used to 
guide an investigator’s recommendation to titrate the study drug dose.  In prior versions of this 
protocol, investigators were compelled to label out -of-range IGF -1 and IGFBP3 values as 
“clinically significant” (regardless of presence of c linical concern, signs, or symptoms) in order 
to pursue dose titrations.  Additionally, clinically significant laboratory values (including IGF -1 
and IGFBP3) were categorically to be documented as AEs.  This amendment revises the protocol 
language so that TransCon hGH dose titrations may occur with or without the labeling of out -of-
range IGF -1 and/or IGFBP3 as “clinically significant.”  It also specifies that out -of-range 
laboratory values may constitute AEs if they induce a new/worsening diagnosis, clinica l sign, or 
symptom, or require therapy.  
Section(s)  Change  Rationale  
Protocol version  Global Amendment 1.0 supersedes  
U.S. (country -specific) Amendment 
1.0. U.S. had a country -specific 
amendment ( US Specific 
Amendment 1 .0) to include protocol 
changes only designated in the U.S. 
for the GH Auto -Injector and Dual 
Chamber Cartridge (DCC) system. 
This Version 2.0 ( Global 
Amendment 1) applies to all regions , 
unless otherwise specified . Thus, 
U.S. will continue from U.S. 
Amendme nt 1.0 to Version 2.0 
(Global Amendment 1)  while all 
other countries will move from 
original protocol to Version 2.0 
(Global Amendment 1).Country -
specific amendments will be applied , 
as needed , to this version and will be 
identified as Version 2.1  in that 
country.

an associated diagnosis, sign, 
symptom; and/or requirement of 
additional action (another test, 
evaluation, or treatment).   In this

INCORPORATED INTO GL OBAL AMENDMENT 1  
RATIONALE  
The original protocol indicates that the GH Auto -Injector  and dual chamber cartridges (DCC) 
will be introduced into the study in certain countries when ready.   Due to labeling practicalities, 
the GH Auto -Injector  will be introduced into sites in the US only.   This US -specific amendment 
contains the procedural changes necessary to  enable  this introduction.  In addition to the GH 
Auto -Injector , this US -specific amendment also includes : a new device usage questionnaire  to be 
collected at specific timepoints; a new dosing weight bracket to account for the DCC strengths; 
the option for  US investigators to keep subjects whose dose may have changed due to increased 
weight on the same dose pending IGF -1 results , and removing the requirement to re -confirm 
IGF-1 SDS lab oratory  results outside the specified range before adjusting dose .

Confidential Information   Global Amendment 1: [ADDRESS_467858] important and obvious 
function of hGH is growth  promotion of children.  Through its IGF -1 mediated  effects ( as well 
as less obvious direct effects ), it stimulates cartilage and bone growth  by [CONTACT_373591].  In addition, hGH has 
important metabolic functions: it exerts potent anti -insulin effects resulting in decreased glucose 
utilization ( and resultant increased pla sma glucose levels) and increased lipolysis  (in contrast to 
the opposing actions of IGF -1 to lower plasma glucose and increase lipogenesis ); these functions 
underlie its continued secretion into adulthood.  New research continues to reveal other potential 
roles of hGH, including regulation of cardiac and immune function, mental agility and aging.  
GHD is the result of impaired production or secretion of hGH, which can appear at any time 
point in life and is due to various known and unknown factors.  The etiology of childhood GHD 
is most commonly of hypothalamic origin with impaired GHRH secretion, the most common 
diagnosis being isolated idiopathic GHD.   GHD is a well -recognized clinical entity in adult s as 
well.  It causes abnormalities in body composition, lipid metabolism, and physical and 
psychosocial function, all of which improve with hGH replacement therapy.    
At the present time , however,  there are no commercially available sustained -release or long -
acting hGH preparations.   Currently hGH  is available only as daily injection formulations , thus  
causing a significant burden and interruption of normal daily life to children and their parents , as 
well as compliance issues.  Decreased compliance with daily hGH therapy  is known to result in 
sub-optimal height outcomes  (Cutfield, 2011 ).  If a weekly long -acting hGH product were to 
have similar efficacy, safety, and tolerability while maintaining hGH exposure in the optimal 
therapeutic range  as existing daily therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], preference and satisfaction for the weekly regimen 
would likely exist, with improved compliance to follow.  
TransCon hGH is a  weekly administered hGH prodrug that liberates unmodified hGH  as the 
active pharmaceutical  ingredient  through controlled auto -hydrolysis resulting in sustained release  
of hGH .  TransCon hGH consists  of hGH that is transiently conjugated to mPEG via a 
(TransCon) linker . 
The linker that forms the bridge between the protein and mPEG moieties is stable at pH 5.0.  
However, after introduction into a physiological pH and temperature ( ie, after injection of 
TransCon  hGH), autohydrolysis of the linker occurs in a controlled manner that follows 
first-order kinetics, whereby [CONTACT_373592], fully -active hGH is released.   As the released hGH is 
completely unmodified, it is expected to have  the same mode of action and tissue distribution as 
endogenous hGH .  This is important for optimal efficacy, as a portion of hGH activity is 
mediated by [CONTACT_373593] e, including the growth plate and adipocytes .  The 
release of hGH also liberates N1, -N1, -N3-trimethyl -1,3-propane -diamine, a small molecular 
weight compound associated with the linker.  The remainder of the inactive mPEG -linker 
component of TransCon hGH is cleared from the body through natural mechanisms  for other 
high molecular weight molecules.

phase 1 trials in healthy adults, one phase 2 trial in adult GHD , and one 6-month p hase 2 trial in 
pediatric GHD .  Upon completion of the TransCon hGH (ACP -001) phase [ADDRESS_467859].  The linker component and hGH  remained the same  between TransCon 
hGH ( ACP -001) and TransCon hGH (ACP -011); the only change was the reduction in  mPEG 
carrier  size.  This change resulted in TransCon hGH (ACP -011), a drug product that is 
functionally equivalent in PK , PD, and safety/tolerability  to its predecessor, but with low er 
viscosity and higher product concentration that enables smaller injection volumes and the use of 
a small -gauge needle.  Additionally, the PEG exposure was reduced by ≥  50%.  
5.2. RELEVANT FINDINGS FR OM NONCLINICAL STUDI ES 
Nonclinical pharmacology and toxicolo gy studies have been conducted to support the clinical 
development program involving weekly SC administration of TransCon hGH (ACP -011) in 
children with growth hormone deficiency.   All pi[INVESTIGATOR_373560] (GLP) and the program as 
a whole follows recommendations provided by [CONTACT_373594].  The nonclinical program has assessed both the parent prodrug and the 
products of autohydrolysis (hGH, the remainder mPEG -linker [measured as mPEG40], and 
TMPD) as well as IGF -1, the PD biomarker for hGH.  
Please refer to the current Investigator’s Brochure  for detailed information pertaining to the 
nonclinical program supporting conduct of this clinical trial.  
5.3. CLINICAL EXPERIENCE  
A phase 1 clinical trial of TransCon hGH (ACP -001) in healthy male volunteers has been 
conducted  as a randomized, double -blind, dose -escalation trial versus placebo and daily hGH 
(Omnitrope) investigating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics 
(PD) response in [ADDRESS_467860] drug were detected 
when compared to placebo and the active comparator (Omnitrope).  The test product was well 
tolerated at up to 0.24 mg hGH/kg when injected once su bcutaneous ly to 28 healthy male 
subjects.  
A second phase 1 single -dose trial investigated the safety and tolerability of TransCon hGH 
(ACP -001) at 2  different dose -levels, 0.30 mg hGH/kg and 0.36 mg hGH/kg, respectively, in 
24 male  and female healthy subje cts.  ACP -001 was well tole rated with no safety concerns.  
A phase 2 clinical trial in adult subjects with GHD was a randomized, open -label, 
active -controlled trial of 3 dose levels of TransCon hGH (ACP -001) (0.02, 0.[ADDRESS_467861] -301EXTClinical Study Protocol   TransCon hGH (ACP -011)

daily doses) over 4 weeks.  A total of 37 subjects were randomized.  ACP -001 was well tolerated 
with no safety concerns.  Detailed information is given in the Investigator’s Brochure.  
A phase 2 clinical trial in pediatric subjects with GHD has been conducted as a multicenter, 
randomized , open -label, active -controlled, parallel -group trial of 3 doses of TransCon hGH 
(ACP -001; 0.14, 0.21 and 0.30 mg hGH/kg /week) compared to daily hGH (Genotropin 0. 21 mg 
hGH/kg /week divided into 7 equal  daily  doses) over [ADDRESS_467862]  (12 subjects in the 0.14 mg hGH/kg/week, 14  subjects 
in the 0.21  mg hGH/kg /week and 14 subjects in the 0.30 mg hGH/ kg/week TransCon hGH 
cohorts and 13  subjects in the 0.21 mg hGH/kg /week Genotropin cohort).  Mean annualized HV 
among the 3  dose levels administered weekly ranged from 11.9 cm for the 0.14 mg/kg/week dose 
to 12.9  cm for the 0.21 mg hGH/kg /week dose to 13.9  cm for the 0.30 mg hGH/kg /week dose, 
which were all comparable to 11.6 cm for the active comparator, daily injections of Genotropin 
at a 0.21 mg hGH/kg /week dose  (Figure  1).

No reports of drug -related serious or unexpected AEs were observed.  A Es were  generally mild 
and observed at the same level and nature compared between the 3 TransCon hGH cohorts and 
the Genotropin cohort.  Injection site reactions were g enerally mild and transient and were 
observed at a rate that was similar to the daily hGH control arm.  There were no observations of 
injection site nodule formation or lipoatrophy.  Low immunogenicity (a single subject  with a low 
titer) was consistent wit h published data for daily hGH .  No neutralizing antibodies were

TransCon hGH (ACP -011) was found to be  bioequivalent (with comparable PK, PD, safety and 
tolerability)  in a Phase 1 single center, randomized, open -label t rial to evaluate comparability of 
PK and PD parameters of ACP -001 and ACP -011. 
In a trial completed in 2018, TransCon hGH (ACP -011) administered by [CONTACT_373595] 
(syringe/needle versus GH Auto -Injector ) was confirmed to be bioequivalent (with comparable 
PK, PD, safety and tolerability) in a phase 1, randomized, open -label, single -dose, crossover 
study in healthy adult males.

5.4. TRIAL RATIONALE  
In comparison to the heiGHt and fliGHt trials, the primary objective of this  extension trial is to 
assess the long-term safety of weekly TransCon hGH (ACP -011) in children with GHD 
previously treated in a TransCon hGH trial.   Additionally, when the GH Auto -Injector , a unique 
device de veloped specifically for the administration of TransCon hGH, becomes available, 
subjects will be switched from the administration of TransCon hGH by [CONTACT_373597] -Injector  in the US only .

5.5. SUMMARY OF POTENTIAL  RISKS AND BENEFITS  
TransCon hGH (ACP -011) is a n investigational medicinal  hGH prodrug product with a proposed 
once -weekly dosing regimen designed to overcome the inconvenience and suboptimal 
compliance of daily hGH injections .  The safety  and efficacy  profile is anticipated to be  
comparable to currently approved daily hGH products , while maintaining exposure (C max and 
AUC) in the optimal therapeutic range .  Moreover, the  biodistribution is designed to be the same 
as with establ ished daily hGH products .  Obviating the need for daily injections should increase 
compliance  and therefore long-term efficacy, which would be of  great benefit to pediatric 
patients with GHD (European Union, 2008 ). 
TransCon hGH administered by [CONTACT_373598] -Injector is expected to have a comparable safety 
profile to TransCon hGH administered b y syringe and needle as well as to daily hGH 
formulations.  
6. OBJECTIVES  
6.1. PRIMARY OBJECTIVE  
To assess long -term safety of weekly TransCon hGH in children with GHD previously treated in 
a phase 3 TransCon hGH trial  
6.2. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES  
• To assess annualized HV with long -term dosing of weekly TransCon hGH treatment  
• To assess the proportion of subjects with IGF -1 SDS in the normal range of 0.0 to +2.0  with 
long-term dosing of weekly TransCon hGH treatment  
• To evaluate the ∆HSDS with long -term dosing of weekly TransCon hGH treatment  
• To determine the incidence of antibodies against TransCon hGH (anti -hGH and anti -PEG) 
with long -term dosing of weekly TransCon hGH treatment  
• To assess the preference for weekly TransCon hGH or daily Genotropin  
• To assess  the treatment satisfaction of weekly TransCon hGH over time  
• In subjects using the GH Auto -Injector : to assess comfort, ease-of-use, and safety   
7. TRIAL DESIGN  
7.1. OVERALL TRIAL DESIGN  AND PLAN  
7.1.1.  Trial Design  
This is a multicenter, phase 3, long -term, open -label extension trial of weekly TransCon hGH in 
children with GHD who previously participated in a  phase [ADDRESS_467868] -301EXTClinical Study Protocol   TransCon hGH (ACP -011)

Confidential Information   Global Amendment 1: 29 January 2020  extension  trial and data collected in the prior trial will serve as baseline data for the extension 
trial. 
Following informed consent, subjects will enter the extension  trial and begin or continue 
TransCon hGH  (depending on prior trial medication).  To continue uninterrupted treatment with 
hGH, Day 1 (the first weekly dose) should occur on the day of Visit 1, or as soon as possible 
thereafter.   To accommodate extension trial activities and scheduling of procedures, the weekly 
dosing and visit schedule may need to be adjusted as a subject enters the extension trial.  In 
unusual situa tions, a period of up to approximately [ADDRESS_467869] dose of the extension trial is acceptable.   After Visit 1 , subsequent v isits will 
occur 5 days (±1 day ) post-dose at Week 13 (±2 weeks)  and then every 1 3 weeks (±2 weeks)  
ongoing .  TransCon hGH will be provided in  single -use glass vials and administered with 
syringe and needle , initially at a strength of 12.1 mg  hGH /vial and subsequently at either 
12.1 mg hGH /vial or 24.2 mg hGH /vial.  Once available, Tra nsCon hGH will be supplied in 
DCCs  for administration using a GH Auto -Injector in the US only . 
The trial will be conducted at approximately  100 sites specialized in the management of pediatric 
GHD that participated in and enrolled subjects in prior TransCon hGH trials.  
The trial consists of:  
1. Visit 1 – the final visit of the prior trial should be  the first visit of  this extension trial , but a 
period up to approximately [ADDRESS_467870] dose 
in the extens ion trial is acceptable  
2. Treatment Period – ongoing treatment until either a) the product is approve d and 
commercially available,  b) alternative arrangements have been made for continued subject 
access  to hGH treatment , or c) treatment for pediatric growth hormone deficiency is no 
longer considered appropriate  
The total duration of participation for each subject in the trial will therefore depend on the 
conditions listed above  in the Treatment Period  and may be different in different countries and 
regions . 
The overall trial design is shown in Figure  2.

TransCon hGH will be injected SC into the left and right buttock, left and right thigh, and left 
and right abdomen by [CONTACT_423]/ parent/legal guardian/caregiver .  To minimize local side 
effects , it is recommended to rotate the six injection sites in a subsequent manner ( eg, right thigh , 
right abdomen, right buttock , left thigh, left abdomen, left buttock).  
The reason for administering the exact volume as per Table  1 (rather than calculating the exact 
dose) is as follows.  When the GH Auto -Injector , a uniqu e device developed specifically for the 
administration of TransCon hGH, becomes available, subjects will be switched from the 
administration of TransCon hGH by [CONTACT_373602] -Injector  in the US only.  
With the GH Auto -Injector , TransCon h GH will be provided in single -use DCCs  as detailed in 
Section  9.1.2 .  Multiple DCC presentations (dose strengths) will be available containing  
approxi mately  20% incremental increases in dose to support increasing weight ranges.  Thus, 
each DCC will contain a specific quantity of TransCon hGH to support a specific weight range 
consistent with Table  1, as shown in Table  2. 
Dosing based on fixed volumes  or DCCs  for weight ranges with 20% bracketing ensures  that all 
subjects will receive an average of 0.24 mg  hGH /kg/week over the course of the trial.

After the GH Auto -Injector  is available  (in the US only) , for subjects whose weight is below  the 
ranges  listed in Table  2, TransCon hGH will continue to be administered using syringe and 
needle .  Once the subject’s weight has reached a weight range listed in Table  2, TransCon hGH 
will be administered using the GH Auto -Injector . 
Please note that there are slight differences in the boundaries of the highest weight brackets in 
Table  2 versus Table  1.  These differences are necessary to maintain the approxima te weight -
based dose of 0.24 mg hGH/kg/week, wh en administering two (duplicate) DCCs per week to 
achieve an absolute total TransCon hGH dose > 13.3. mg/week.  
For those subjects who have historically been dose -titrated to a bracket different (higher or 
lowe r) than expected for weight, and have had interval weight gain into a higher bracket, the 
investigator has the option to either:  
• Increase the absolute dose according to Table  [ADDRESS_467876] 
who weighed 15 kg at a prior visit has been taking a dose volume (vial) or absolute dose

characteristics of TransCon hGH.  
9.4. DISPENSING AND STORA GE 
TransCon hGH must be kept in a locked area  at the clinic  with access limited to designated trial 
staff and stored according to its labeling .  The sWFI supplied for reconstitution of TransCon 
hGH should also be stored according to its labeling .  All products will be temperature monitored, 
as appropriate.   
TransCon hGH and sWFI will be dispensed to the subjects/ parents/legal guardians /caregivers  by 
[CONTACT_373603].  
Further details are provided in the Pharmacy Manual and Instructions for Use . 
9.5. SELECTION OF TRIAL DOSES  
TransCon hGH is an inactive prodrug.  The phase 2 pediatric GHD trial with TransCon hGH 
demonstrated that a dose of 0.21 mg hGH/kg /week provided similar hGH exposure , efficacy 
(annualized HV ), and safety/tolerability compared to the equiv alent weekly dose of Genotropin, 
with PD demonstrating normalization of IGF-1 SDS.  This trial also demonstrated comparable 
tolerability and safety and numerically greater annual HV with a 0.30 mg  hGH /kg/week dose of 
TransCon hGH.  Treatment guidelines support an hGH dose of 0.24  mg hGH/kg /week 
(Grimberg, 2016 ) .  The TransCon hGH 0.24  mg hGH/kg /week dose is currently being studied in 
the phase [ADDRESS_467878] the TransCon hGH dose 
without Medical Expert  [CONTACT_094]-approval.  
• At each visit, the TransCon hGH dose volume (vial) or DCC dose strength may be adjusted 
by [CONTACT_373604] (vial) or TransCon 
hGH Dosing Table for the GH Auto -Injector and DCC Product  (See Section  9.3). 
• Additionally, t he goal for IGF -1 should be between 0 and +  2.0 SDS (unless a different target 
is identified in consultation  with the Medical Expert ).  Thus, if the IGF -1 SDS measured at a 
visit is < 0 SDS, the dose may be increased by [CONTACT_3450] 20% to the next higher  weight 
bracket by [CONTACT_093]  (See Section  9.3) (Although the prior requirement  has been 
eliminated for a second [ “confirmatory ”] IGF -[ADDRESS_467879] -dose (±1 day) remains optional at the investigator’s 
discreti on.) 
• Additionally , if HV is considered  to be suboptimal in an adherent subject, the dose of 
TransCon  hGH may be increased after consultation with the Medical Expert.

The investigator or Medical Expert  (and, if needed, with the ISC review) may stop or reduce the 
dose of investigational product  for an individual subject at any time during the trial (please notify 
the Medical Expert [INVESTIGATOR_91394]) .  For example, consideration for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_373562] g the 
dose may occur  in the presence of the following  symptoms and laboratory abnormalities:  
• Severe hGH -related AEs at any time during the trial ( eg, peripheral edema, severe headache, 
intracranial hypertension or other adverse drug reaction and/or abnorma l laboratory values) . 
• Pregnancy: A subject must be discontinued from the trial if pregnant.   
• IGF-1 > +2.0 SDS : The TransCon hGH dose may be decreased by [CONTACT_3450] 20% to the 
next lower weight bracket, unless a different target SDS is identified in consultation  with the 
Medical Expert .  See Section  9.3 for details.  (Although the prior requirement  has been 
eliminated for a second [ “confirmatory ”] IGF -[ADDRESS_467880] -dose (±1 day) remains optional at the investigator’s 
discretion.)  
Any re -establishment of the prior dose due to a subsequent sub -optimal IGF -1 response 
should receive prior approval by [CONTACT_373584] . 
• In those subjects who have historically been dose titrated to a bracket different than expected 
for weight, the investigator may —at study visits —recommend maintenance of the current 
absolute dose until the visit’s IGF -[ADDRESS_467881] the mos t appropriate dose volume or DCC 
presentation.  
• Evidence of hypersensitivity to TransCon hGH  
• Evidence of clinically significant pre -diabetes or diabetes (HbA1c  > 6.2%  and an absolute 
increase of 0.5% from the prior visit  HbA1c ): Confirmation of HbA1c level is required.  
Once confirmed, TransCon hGH dose may be decreased to the next lower weight bracket.  If 
appropriate follow -up monitoring shows progressively worsening glucose intolerance, 
additional TransCon hGH dose adjustments  may be appropriate.  
• Clinical  evidence of BIH based on history and physical exam, including visual changes, 
headaches, nausea, vomiting, and/or papi[INVESTIGATOR_373563] : TransCon hGH treatment 
should be discontinued while BIH is  clinical ly manage d.

The tria l will use an Internet -based interactive web response system (IWRS)  to capture drug 
inventory and accountability data, including receipt of drug inventory and supplies by [CONTACT_779], 
distribution to subjects, return to the site from subjects, and return to t he Sponsor (or destruction 
with the Sponsor’s approval).   Each investigational product  delivery to the site must be 
confirmed, including date, quantity, and batch/pack number.  Each drug dispensed by [CONTACT_373605] 
a subject must include date and amount of dr ug dispensed.  Each drug returned to the site by a 
subject must include date and amount of unused drug returned.  
The computer system complies with all applicable regulatory requirements for record keepi[INVESTIGATOR_373565] (21 CFR Pa rt 11 and ICH E6 GCP ) as do paper systems .   
The system is designed so that changes to any record do not obs cure the original information.  
The audit record will clearly indicate that a change was made and clearly provide a means to 
locate and read the prior information.  All changes to the data have an electronic audit trail in 
accordance with 21 CFR 11.10(e).  Electronic signatures will be used in accordance  with [ADDRESS_467883]  and ancillary supplies , along with a copy of the inventory

conditions listed above and may be different in different countries and regions.  
10.2. TRIAL PERIODS AND VI SITS  
Following  confirmation of eligibility, enrolled subjects will begin attending morning visits  every 
13 weeks (±2 week s):  
• Visit 1:  Week 1  (Day [ADDRESS_467887] week ly dose ) 
• Visit 2 : Week 13 (±2 week s), 5 days (±1 day) after the 11th, 12th, 13th, 14th or 15 th dose 
• Visit 3:  Week 26 (±2 week s), 5 days (±1 day) after the 24th, 25th, 26th, 27th or 28 th dose 
This pattern will continue until completion of the trial.  All visits should be in the morning for 
consistent height measurements.  Attempts should be made to adhere to the planned visit 
schedule.  It is suggested that the site staff provide dosing, diary,  and visit reminders ( eg, phone 
calls) to subjects/parents/legal guardians /caregivers  between visits , especially for those subjects 
who transitioned from Genotropin to TransCon hGH.  
An overview of all visits is provided in the Schedule of Events ( Section  18.2). 
For detailed desc riptions of assessments refer to Section  11. 
10.2.1.  Visit [ADDRESS_467888] be 
approved by [CONTACT_19821] /HREC/ IEC prior to implementation.  Release of medical 
information authorization should also be obtained at the time of infor med consent.  
Visit 1 of the extension trial should be the same day as the final visit of the prior trial  and may 
occur over several days.   To continue uninterrupted treatment with hGH, Day 1 (the first weekly 
dose) should occur on the day of Visit [ADDRESS_467889] -301 trial (heiGHt trial), or as soon as possible  thereafter .   If the subject is 
entering after completion of the TransCon hGH CT -302 (fliGHt trial), they should remain on 
their dosing schedule a nd take their dose approximately two days after Visit  1, or as soon as 
possible  thereafter .  To accommodate extensio n trial activities and scheduling of procedures, the 
weekly dosing and visit schedule may need to be adjusted as a subject enters the extens ion trial .  
In unusual situations, a period of up to approximately [ADDRESS_467890] dose of the extension trial is acceptable . 
During Visit 1 (and again on Day 1, if on a subsequent day), the investigator wil l review all 
baseline data collected to determine the subject’s eligibility.   Data collected up through the final 
visit of the prior trial may be used as baseline data for the extension trial.   The follo wing will be

11.3. HEIGHT MEASUREMENT  
Height should be measured at each visit , preferably  by [CONTACT_373611] , at approximately the 
same time of day using a wall -mounted stadiometer  (to minimize bias and reduce variability) , the 
accuracy of which has been verified  prior to each visit using a validated  metallic calibration rod .   
Children < [ADDRESS_467902] placed 
on a flat, stable surface such as a table.   Note: despi[INVESTIGATOR_373568] a length board, once a subject is 2 years old, the subsequent measurements should 
be perform ed on a stadiometer.  
For subjects ≥ 2 years old, obtain the height  measurement  on a wall-mounted stadiometer

Testing for  hCG  should be performed for female subjects of child -bearing potential .  Subjects 
who are sexually active must use an effective form of contraception.  
11.7. PATIENT -REPORTED OUT COME MEASURES  
All Patient -Reported Outcomes  (including PQ, CSDS, and C&OS)  used in t his trial have been 
assessed for understanding by [CONTACT_373613]/legal guardians/caregivers as 
intended by [CONTACT_21411] a prior Cognitive Debriefing study per the Guidance for Industry – 
Patient -Reported Outcome Measures: Use in Medical P roduct Development to Support 
Labeling Claims  (Guidance for Industry, 2009 ). 
11.7.1.  Preference Questionnaire  
The Preference Questionnaire should only be completed for subjects who were treated with daily 
Genotropin in the prior  TransCon hGH CT -301 trial .  The parent/legal guardian/caregiver will 
complete the PQ -P, while the subject, if ≥ 9 years old at Visit 1 , will complete the PQ -C. 
The timing of the preference questionnaires is listed in  Section [IP_ADDRESS] . 
11.7.2.  Child Sheehan Disability Scale  
The CSDS is an adaptation of the Sheehan Disability Scale to assess imp airment related to 
childhood anxiety on children and their parents  (Whiteside, 2009 ).  This measure is being 
adapted in this trial to assess impairment related to treatment burden on children and th eir 
parents/legal guardians/caregivers.   
At Visit 1  for all subjects , the parent/legal guardian/caregiver will complete the CSDS -P, while 
the subject, if ≥ 9 years  old, will complete the CSDS -C.

Confidential Information   Global Amendment 1: 29 January 2020  11.7.3.  Convenience & Overall Satisfaction Domains  of the Treatment Satisfaction 
Questionnaire for Medication  
The original 14-item Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM) Version 1.4 
is a reliable and valid instrument to assess patients' satisfaction with medication, providing 
scores in four domains – Side Effects, Effectiveness, Convenience and Overall  Satisfaction.  In 
naturalistic studies, administering the TSQM with the Side Effects domain could provoke the 
physician to assess the presence or absence of adverse events in a way that is clinically atypi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], 
carrying the potential to interfere with routine m edical care.  As a result, a TSQM -9, derived 
from the TSQM Version 1.4 but without the Side Effects domain was created  (Bharmal, 2009 ).  
This measure is being adapted further for this trial  with the  removal of the  Effectiveness domain 
since effectiveness of hGH is not subjective and will be assessed with objective measures in this 
and other trials evaluating TransCon hGH.  Thus, only C&OS of the TSQM -9 will be used.   
At Visit 1 for all subjects, the parent/legal guardian/caregiver will complete the C&OS -P.  The 
timing of the questionnaires to be completed after Visit 1 is listed in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]  and 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS] . 
11.7.4.  Device Usability Questionnaire  
The Device Usability Questionnaire  will be administered during this trial to assess GH Auto -
Injector comfort , ease-of-use, and safety  from the point of view of the caregivers and 
subjects.   The data will supplement the GH Auto -Injector ease -of-use and functionality data 
gathered from a pre vious phase 1 clinical trial (comparing TransCon hGH administered by [CONTACT_373614] -Injector and by [CONTACT_129325]/needle), as well as data gathered during the formative and 
summative usability studies conducted in the device design and development phases.   The data 
will also be analyzed as part of this current trial’s overall assessment of safety and efficacy.  
The DUQ was designed for use by [CONTACT_373615]/or adults.   It consists of eight statements that the 
subject or caregiver (ie, whomever is designated as the individu al primarily responsible for 
preparing and performing the injection with the GH Auto -Injector) is asked to rank on a scale 
indicating level of agreement.   The statements relate to  the level of comfort , ease-of-use, and 
safety . 
This timing of DUQ administra tion is outlined in  Section  [IP_ADDRESS] . 
11.8. SUBJECT DIARY  
The subject diary will be provided to the subject/parent/legal guardian/caregiver at the clinic 
visits and should be completed weekly on the day of investigational product  administration.   The 
data captured within the subject diary includes:  
• Date and time of administration  
• Dose of investigational product  
• Person preparing and giving injection  
• Location of injection on subject’s body  
• Assessment of local tolerability

prior documented bone age was >  12.0 years, and the bone age x -ray was performed greater than 
9 months prior to Visit 1, a bone age x -ray should  be performed within approximately 4  weeks of 
Visit 1 . 
11.10.  LABORATORY ASSESSMEN TS 
Blood will be collected  at each visit for assessments as listed in the Schedule of Events 
(Section  18.2), and described in Section  10.2.  The total blood volume collected in a 3 -month 
period will be up to approximately 18  mL, and the total collected in a 6-month period will be up 
to approximately 30 mL . 
Detailed blood sampling , processing and assaying of samples will be provided in the laboratory 
manual . 
11.11.  LOCAL TOLERABILITY A SSESSMENT  
Local tolerability is defined as an injection site reaction deemed abnormal from those ordinarily 
observed in SC injections (includin g pain, inten sity, or duration), and will be collected on an AE 
form, as appropriate.   Between visits, local tolerability will be evaluated and documented by [CONTACT_1560]/parent/legal guardian/caregiver in the subject diary.   
At clinic visits , assessment of local toler ability will be performed by  [CONTACT_373616] (documented as part of the physical exam), in conjunction with subject diary 
review.  
11.11.1.  Reporting Local Tolerability as an Adverse E vent 
For the purpose of this trial, injection site reactions should not be documented as AEs unless the 
reaction:  
• impacts  the subject’s  ability to perform daily activitie s, or  
• requires medical therapy (not including prophylactic therapy)

12.1.1.  Definition  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject 
administered  a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal rel ationship 
with the treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavo rable and unintended sign, symptom, or

not related to that product.  An AE can arise with any use ( eg, in combination with another drug), 
route of administratio n, formulation, or dose, including an overdose.  
Possible AEs associated with TransCon hGH are listed in the Investigator ’s Brochure or the 
accompanying Reference Safety Information.  The adverse reactions associated with 
commercially available daily hGH -containing products that may or may not be observed with 
use of TransCon hGH are:  
• Sudden death in pediatric patients with Prader -Willi syndrome; risk factors include morbid 
obesity, history of upper airway obstruction or sleep apnea, and unidentified respi[INVESTIGATOR_373570]  
• Intracranial tumors, particularly meningiomas, in teenagers/young adults treated with brain 
irradiation as children  
• Injection site reactions/rashes (as well as rare, generalized hypersensitivity reactions)  
• Skin atrophy and lipoatrophy  
• Note:  Rotating the injection site ( see Section  9.3) is expected to decrease the risk of skin 
atrophy  or lipoatrophy . 
• Headaches  
• Glucose intolerance, including impaired glucose tolerance/impaired fasting glucose as well 
as overt diabetes mellitus  
• Intracranial hypertension with papi[INVESTIGATOR_044], visual changes, headache, nausea, and/or 
vomiting  
• Fluid retention manifested by [CONTACT_315950], arthr algia, myalgia, nerve compression syndromes 
(including carpal tunnel syndrome/paresthesias)  
• Hypothyroidism (central [secondary ] hypothyroidism may first become clinically evident or 
worsen  in patients with GHD  during hGH treatment ) 
• Slipped capi[INVESTIGATOR_373571] (occurs more  frequently in pa tients with endocrine 
disorders or in pati ents undergoing rapid growth)    
• Note: Any subject with the onset of a limp or complaints of hip or knee pain should be 
carefully evaluated for a slipped capi[INVESTIGATOR_373572]. 
• Progression of pre-existing scoliosis  due to rapid growth  (hGH  has not been shown to 
increase the occurrence of scoliosis ) 
Note: Any subjects with a history of scoliosis should be monitored for progression of 
scoliosis.   
• Pancreatitis - Cases of panc reatitis have been reported rarely in children and adults receiving 
hGH  treatment, with some evidence supporting a greater risk in  children compared with 
adults.   Pancreatitis should be considered in any hGH -treated subject, especially a child, who 
develop s persistent severe abdominal pain.

will also be reviewed periodically by [CONTACT_373617] a ccordance with its governing charter.  
12.1.2.  Severity, Causality , and Outcome Assessment  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Severity Rating  
The following guideline  must be used by [CONTACT_221464]: 
Mild  – The subject is aware of the sign or symptom but tolerates it easily.  The event is of little 
concern to the subject and/or of littl e or no clinical significance.  The event is not expected to 
have any effect on the s ubject’s health or well -being.  The e vent may or may not require medical 
intervention.  
Moderate  – The event causes the subject  enough discomfort for it to cause interference with or 
change some of the subject’s usual activities.   The event is of some concern to the s ubject and 
poses some ris k to the subject’s health or well -being.  The event may require medical 
intervention.  
Severe  – The subject is incapacitated and unable to work or participate in  many or all usual 
activities.  The event is of definite concern to the subject and/or poses sub stantial risk to the 
subject’s health or well -being.  The event is likely to require medical intervention and/or close 
follow -up. 
Life-threatening  – The subject is at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Causality Rating  
The principal inv estigator will assess the causal relationship between the  investigational product  
and the event using the following guideline:  
Definite  – This causality category applies to those AEs which the investigator feels are clearly  
related to the investigational p roduc t.  An AE may be categorized  as definitely related to the 
investigational product  when the event meets the first 4 (or more ) of the following criteria:

degree of certainty are related to the investigational product .  An AE may be categorized as 
probably related to the investigationa l product  when the event meets the first 3 (or more ) of the 
following criteria:  
• The event  follows a reasonable temporal sequence from investigational product  
administration  
• The event  cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_11176]’s clinical

Possible  – This causality category applies to those AEs in which the  investigator feels  there is a 
reasonable, although not probable, connection with the investigational product .  An AE may be 
categorized as  possibl y related to the investigational product  when the  event mee ts the  first 2 (or 
more ) of the following criteria:  
• The event  follows a reasonable temporal sequence from investigational product  
administration  
• The event  is possibl y explained  by [CONTACT_11176]’s clinical state,

Subjects will be followed until AEs have either resolved, subjects have returned to  their baseline 
status, or subjects are deemed stable or commensurate w ith ongoing disease processes.  One of [ADDRESS_467907] be recorded:  
Resolved  – The subject has fully recovered from the event and has returned to baseline status  
without residual observable effects.  
Resolved with sequelae  – The subject has recovered from the event with some residual 
observable effects.  
Ongoing  – The subject has no t recovered from the event and observable effects remain, 
regardless of whether the  event is  changing or stable and persistent.  
Death Due to This Event  – The subject died because of the event  
Death Due to Other Event  – The subject had not  recovered from th e event at the time of death  
Lost to Follow -up – The subject had not  recovered from the event at the time of last contact  
12.1.3.  Reporting Procedures for All Adverse Events  
At each visit, a ll AEs will be documented  in response to a general question about the subj ect’s 
well-being and whether any possible changes  in well -being have occurred since  the previous 
visit.  Additionally, at each visit, site staff will review subject diary data with the subject and 
parent/legal guardian/caregiver, to determine if diary entr ies reflect any AEs.  There will be no 
direct questioning to solicit  possible AEs .  AEs reported up to  [ADDRESS_467908]’s participation in the trial .  All AEs ongoing at the completion of the study  or Early 
Termination  Visit must be followed until the event is resolved or deem ed stable by [CONTACT_1275].  In this trial, all AEs that are considered mild and not related to investigational 
product  will not be reported on the AE CRF.  In addition, the following out -of-range laboratory 
values —whether or not associated with a titration of the TransCon hGH dose —will not be 
considered AEs unless they are associated with a clinical sign or symptom: IGF -1, IGF -1 SDS, 
IGFBP3, IGFBP3.  In this trial, IGF -1 and IGFBP3 are pharmacodynamic markers of TransCon 
hGH therapy and may be used to guide  an investigator’s recommend ation to titrate the  TransCon 
hGH  dose.  Reportable AEs must be recorded on the  appropriate  eCRF.   Reportable AEs either

• Severity  
• Causality ( relationship to investigationa l product ) 
• Outcome  
• Action taken  
• Determination of “serious ” (or not)  
Any ongoing AEs from the prior  trial will be followed until resolution or stabilization .  Any 
changes  to the condition s documented as medical history during the trial  and that meet the above 
AE definition  should be  recorded as AE s so that  a comple te safety profile of the investigational 
product  is obtained.  See Section  12.2.[ADDRESS_467909] results may constitute AEs if they : 
• induce a new/worsening diagnosis, clinical sign , or symptom , or 
• require therapy . 
Routine titration of chronic, concomitant medications (eg, increase of levothyroxine dose due to 
interval weight gain  and without associated signs/symptoms of overt hypothyroidism ) would not 
be considered a s AEs.  Whenever possible, an AE should be recorded as a specific diagnosis or 
syndrome rat her than as a sign, symptom, or out-of-range laboratory value.  If there is not a 
diagnosis, the event term should be the clinical sign or symptom.   Based on an investigator’s 
clinical judgement , multiple concurrent symptoms should be grouped t ogether  as a single , 
unifying  diagnosis  (e.g. headache, fever, cough, and coryza constitute a probabl e viral upper 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092] , and this single AE term is more appropriate than listing each symptom 
as a separate AE).  
Care should also be tak en to record the most medically appropriate term ( eg, hypertension for 
elevated blood pressure that persists and requires chronic treatment and follow -up, or increased 
blood pressure for elevated blood pressure that occurs for a limited time and does not p ersist or 
require ongoing treatment).  
AEs will be documented  at the maximum intensity experienced.  If a previously recorded AE or 
condition recorded as part of medical history increases in severity or frequency, i t will be 
recorded as a new AE.  
All AEs wi ll be considered  ongoing until they have completely resolved or, in the case of a 
condition  recorded as part of medical history , returned to baseline status prior  to investigational 
product  administration.  At study completion  or the Early Termination Visit , all AEs should have 
a stateme nt regarding resolution.

[IP_ADDRESS].  Serious Adverse Event Definition  
In addition to severity and causality ratings, each AE is to be classified by [CONTACT_1694] 
“serious ” or “not serious. ” 
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that: 
• Results in death  
• Is life -threate ning 
Note:   The term “life-threatening ” here refers to an event in which the subject was  at risk of 
death at the time of the event .  It does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have 
caused death if it were more severe.  
• Requires inpatient hospi [INVESTIGATOR_373573]: Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34096] , for a routinely scheduled treatment , or 
scheduled in advance of trial participation are not  considered SAE s. 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity , or disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions  
• Is a co ngenital anomaly/birth defect  
Note:  This applies if a subject exposed to an investigational product gives birth to a child 
with a congenital anomaly or birth defect . 
• Is an important medical event  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgement, 
they may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed 
in this definition .  
Events  not considered to be SAEs are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5315]:

A suspected unexp ected serious adverse reaction  (S[LOCATION_003]R ) is any AE for which there is evidence 
to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE, and which is assessed as both 
unexpected and serious.   A suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected ” if it is not 
listed in the Investigator’s Brochure  or Reference Safety Information as associated with 
TransCon hGH , or if it is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed.  The 
final determination of e xpectedness will be assessed  by [CONTACT_1034] . 
Non-Serious A dverse Events Leading to Discontinuation  
If situation permits, non -serious events (including laboratory abnormalities  and pregnancies ) that 
may require permanent discontinuati on of investigational product  should be discussed with the

Lay Summary of Proposed  Research 
Lay Summary of Proposed ResearchThe purpose  of the present research  is to test a potential new  treatment for auditory verbal  hallucinations in 
schizophrenia that  uses transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS),  a neurostimulation technique that  
passes an extremely weak electric current through the brain. During the treatment, two electrodes  are 
positioned on the  scalp  above regions of  the brain implicated in abnormal cortical activity associated  with 
auditory verbal hallucinations  in schizophrenia (1-3). Due to  the directional flow of current, one electrode, 
termed “cathodal”,  inhibits cortical activity, and the other, termed “anodal”, increases  cortical  activity.  
These electrodes will be placed such that cathodal stimulation is applied to an  area  associated with 
hyperactivity and anodal stimulation to an area  associated with hypoactivity. One preliminary study has

revealed that  this form of neurostimulation can alleviate auditory  verbal hallucination  symptoms both 
immediately following  five days of treatment  and up to three months  after the final treatment(4). The goal of 
this study is to replicate these effects  and explore the mechanisms that may underpin them.
 
[ADDRESS_1171096] the inhibitory (cathodal) 
tDCS electrode placed over left  auditory cortex relative to  an anodal placed over frontal cortex on the right 
side. tDCS treatments will take place for 20 min per day for 5 consecutive days.  For  sham,  procedures will 
be similar except that  sham (inactive) tDCS treatment  will be used. Assessment  batteries will then be  
repeated following  completion of treatment  and at 1 and 3 mo following treatment. In addition, patients will 
be offered the possibility  to participate in a concurrent magnetic resonance  imaging (MRI)  study aimed at  
evaluating the effects of tDCS on activation of auditory cortex  during a auditory  discrimination task as well  
as on other imaging  parameters related  to resting brain activity and metabolism. Patients  who agree to 
participate in this MRI study will be scanned before and after active or sham tDCS.
 
In addition  to hallucinating patients, we  will recruit  up to  [ADDRESS_1171097] similar assessments to the patients, but will not  receive tDCS. Overall, we 
hypothesize that tDCS treatment will lead to reduction in hallucinations, improvement in auditory function, and change in MRI measurements so that patients more closely resemble healthy  volunteers  and non-
hallucinating patients.  
Background, Significance  and Rationale
Background, Significance and RationaleThe term “hallucination”  refers to a sensory experience  that is not in  accordance with  reality.  For example, 
many individuals  who suffer from schizophrenia have the experience that people are speaking to them  
(“auditory verbal hallucinations”) even when  this is not, in fact,  the case. Moreover, the voices experienced 
by [CONTACT_842627], leading to significant  emotional  distress. In the worst 
case, hallucinations may  “command” individuals to perform acts that are harmful to themselves of  others.  In 
some cases,  voices are perceived coming  from inside the head, although  in others they are experienced as 
coming from outside. Although hallucinations  respond adequately  to antipsychotic medications in most 
patients with schizophrenia, for some patients  the hallucinations persist  and remain a significant source  of 
distress. The present project is  directed  toward  development of a new treatment for persistent auditory  
verbal hallucinations in individual with schizophrenia. 
 
One theory  regarding the etiology of  auditory hallucinations is that they reflect overactivity of the auditory  
region of brain (auditory cortex), especially left temporo-parietal cortex(1), and hypoactivity in the prefrontal cortex, especially dorsolateral  and anterior cingulate  regions(2,  5). In individuals with  persistent 
hallucinations, these abnormalities persist despi[INVESTIGATOR_842619]. Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) is a relatively new technique in which  small electrodes are placed  over  
specific regions of the  scalp and extremely low currents (1-2 mA) are  applied to  specific  brain regions for 
up to 20 minutes. Depending  upon the direction of  current  flow, these  currents may either increase

(stimulate) or decrease  (inhibit) activity  in underlying brain regions. It  has been reported  that applying 
inhibitory currents  over left auditory  regions for 20 min per day over  5 consecutive days leads  to significant, 
long-lasting reductions  in auditory hallucinations (6). The present study seeks to replicate this  finding and  
will utilize MRI measures of brain activity  and metabolism and behavioral assessments to  understand the 
underlying mechanisms.  
Specific Aims and Hypotheses
Specific Aims and  Hypotheses
The aim of  this study is to evaluate  the effects on schizophrenia symptoms of tDCS  applied with  cathodal 
(inhibitory) electrode over the left temporo-parietal junction and anodal  (excitatory) electrode over the left  
dorsolateral prefrontal  cortex.
Our specific hypotheses are:
1.In comparison to sham, active  tDCS treatment will decrease the severity of refractory auditory 
hallucinations in patients with schizophrenia
2.In comparison to sham, active  tDCS treatment will decrease the severity of negative schizophrenia 
symptoms
3.In comparison to sham, active  tDCS treatment will normalize auditory function  as reflected in 
stronger prediction error  signals  in the auditory cortex during the auditory  discrimination task and  
decreased baseline activity in this region.  
4.In comparison to sham, active  tDCS treatment will normalize auditory function  as reflected in 
reduced cerebral blood flow in auditory  cortex  and normalized  metabolism.
5.Symptom alleviation following active tDCS treatment will be  maintained over the course of 3 
months
The two control  groups  (AVH- and healthy controls) will serve as comparison groups  for specific  AIM [ADDRESS_1171098] Population

Gender, Racial and  Ethnic Breakdown
Expected racial breakdown is approximately  50% Caucasian, 16% African-American, 16% Hispanic, 16% 
Asian, and 2% other. Expected gender ratio is 50% male and 50% female.
Description of subject population60 patients between the ages of [ADDRESS_1171102] 3 months. 
In addition  to the primary intervention group, two comparison groups  will be studied:
1. A group  of patients  with  minimal or no auditory hallucinations (AH-) (n=20); and
2. A group  of non-clinical  healthy volunteers (n=20)
These subjects will  be tested using a subset of  the baseline assessment  battery  used with AH+ patients,  but 
will not receive  tDCS or  repeat assessments.
All patients will  be receiving antipsychotic  medication  at the time of study entry. Patients  will remain on 
their present dose of antipsychotic  medication  throughout the treatment  interval.  
All participants  will receive a  physical examination and medical history  evaluation in order  to rule out  
disorders that might increase risks associated with tDCS, a  urine toxicology  screen  to rule out  illicit drug 
abuse, and a pregnancy test  for women of childbearing capacity.  After passing all screening criteria, 
participants may be removed from the study if they  do not comply  with  study procedures, if  there is a

How and by [CONTACT_60504]/or recruited? 
Patients will be recruited from the Lieber  Schizophrenia  Research Clinic  as follows:
1.      Clinical psychiatrists  and psychologists of each service will be informed about  the study.
2.      The clinic psychiatrist will ask patients  that they feel are clinically appropriate to see if he 
or she would agree to be contact[CONTACT_842628].
3.      If the patient agrees, then a study  psychiatrist or psychologist  would meet with the patient  
to describe  the study and ask if the patient would be interested in participating.
4.      If the patient is interested in the study and appears to meet  general eligibility criteria, the 
patient would  be evaluated for capacity to give informed consent,  and if they have adequate 
capacity, then provide written informed consent.

Study Procedures
Describe the procedures required for this studyOverview
 
AH + Sample
 
The treatment portion  of this study will follow a double-blind parallel arm design in which patients, raters 
and investigators will be blinded with respect to condition assignment. All  personnel  will have undergone 
HIPAA and CITI training. Following a clinical  evaluation  to determine eligibility, patients will be assigned 
to either the active or the sham condition. In the  active condition, patients will receive cathodal stimulation 
to the left temporo-parietal  junction  and anodal stimulation to  the left  dorsolateral  prefrontal  cortex at 2mA  
X 20 min in each session. In the sham  condition, electrodes will be  placed  over  the same  regions,  but current  
will be applied  under a  “sham” approach in which  currents are initially  ramped  up over 30 s  as in  the active 
condition, but then  immediately ramped down. Prior experience has shown that  subjects  do not  distinguish 
the active and sham  conditions.  Patients  will participate in two daily  sessions of 20 minutes each for 5 
consecutive weekdays. Auditory hallucinations  as determined by [CONTACT_842633] 
(AHRS) and the five dimensions of schizophrenia  symptoms assessed in the Positive and Negative 
Syndrome Scale (PANSS) will be assessed  at baseline, immediately following the final treatment, and at 1-  
and 3-month follow-up timepoints. AHRS  will be  repeated prior to first treatment session.  All subjects will 
be assessed prior to and following initiation of 5-d  treatment period using a neurophysiological battery 
sensitive to auditory dysfunction in schizophrenia,  and neuropsychological tests  of auditory  and general 
neurocognitive impairment. The neurophysiological impact of tDCS will be assessed  by [CONTACT_842634].  MRI sessions are optional for  
AVH+ patients.
 
Comparison Samples
 
AH- patients and non-clinical control participants will first undergo  clinical evaluation  to determine 
eligibility according to their sample’s respective  inclusion/exclusion criteria before  participating in a  
baseline assessment session. Baseline  assessments for the AH- patients will include the  same 
neurophysiological battery sensitive  to auditory dysfunction, neuropsychological  tests auditory  and general 
neurocognitive impairment, MRI  procedures  that the AH+  patient  sample receives. Non-clinical  control 
participants will  only take part  in the assessment of auditory function  and MRI  procedure.
 
Evaluation
 
After the patient signs the informed consent form and the HIPAA authorization,  he/she will undergo  clinical 
evaluation to determine study eligibility. All participants will receive  medical assessments from an  MD 
(medical history,  physical  examination, urine  pregnancy test and toxicology) and either the SCID 
(schizophrenia patients) from an  RN or SCID-NP  (non-clinical controls)  from  an MA level psychologist. 
All patients with  schizophrenia will also undergo  a psychiatric history  assessment  with an  MD. Patients  in 
the AH+  sample will undergo  additional medical assessments  including blood  draw, urinalysis and ECG to 
ensure tDCS  safety.  A urine pregnancy will be  done during screening and prior  to the first tDCS session (on 
Day 1).

controls will consist of  a computerized tone matching task (TMT) which  will assess their ability to match 
tones following brief delay (8, 9)
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)Subjects who  consent for the optional MRI component will undergo MRI scanning, which  includes 
structural 3-Tesla  MRI  scans and  task-based  fMRI scans and may include resting-state fMRI,  resting-state 
ASL, magnetic resonance spectroscopy,  and diffusion tensor  imaging. None of  the imaging modalities used  
in the study will include exogenous contrasts.  Total  scanning time will typi[INVESTIGATOR_43182] 2 hours and will  
not exceed 3 hours.    MRI scans will be  performed immediately  before  and after  the treatment period with active  or sham  tDCS 
in AVH+ patients.  Comparison  AVH- patients and  healthy participants will also undergo MRI scanning 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_842621]. On the  day of MRI scanning, subjects will be  accompanied  to the MRI  suite at 
the NYSPI [INVESTIGATOR_842622]  (depending  on availability). The subject will be placed in a  supi[INVESTIGATOR_842623]. Head  will be positioned and  a plastic head-holder will be  used to  decrease 
head movement during the scan.  A bite bar (a  soft but  firm  mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959])  will also be  offered to  the subjects  
to prevent  excessive movement. Participants may or may not bite  down  on the bite bar.  A new disposable 
cover for the bite  bar will be used for every new participant. The  participants will be given foam earplugs to 
reduce the noise of the MRI as well as  a MRI-compatible hand  held  response pad  for responding  to the task 
(multi-button response units or  mouse or a similar device). The tasks will be projected from  an Insight liquid 
crystal display (LCD) projector zoomed to a screen  inside the MR suite or viewed  through dual channel  
binocular goggles (Silent  Vision SV-2600; Avotec, Inc.). All subjects will undergo a structural MRI scan at 
the beginning of the session to allow for anatomical co-registration. Women  will have  urine pregnancy 
testing on each  MRI  scan day.
MRI Screening 
Before inclusion  in the MRI experiment, all subjects  will be screened to ensure  their eligibility for MRI  
scanning. The screening questionnaire  includes questions regarding inclusion/exclusion  criteria, including 
the presence of ferromagnetic implants, pubertal status, and  pregnancy.  Questions will be  asked to  
determine if girls/women  are post-menarche  or pre-menopausal. Menarche will be defined as the onset  of

(i.e. metal  heart valve, aortic clips, etc.)  that are unsuitable for the scanner, the subject  will not  be included 
in our study. Inclusion and exclusion  in our study will be determined by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_6254]-PIs  in this study.  
Further screening will be  done via the New  York State Psychiatric Institute – Dept. of Psychiatry MRI  
Metal Screening Questionnaire. A 38-item questionnaire that was developed by [CONTACT_842636]. This  questionnaire asks specifically about  
metallic implants  and past experiences with metal to further ascertain any possible risks  the person may 
incur by [CONTACT_842637].  Again, if any metallic implants are  detected that  are unsuitable  for the 
scanner, the subject will not be included in our study. All  precautions will be taken  for the safety of the 
participants.fMRI Task Description (auditory  discrimination  task)
Participants will perform an auditory  discrimination task during  the fMRI scans. This  task is designed to  
detect activation in the  auditory cortex and other language-related areas, without interference  from the 
scanner noise, regardless  whether the  activation  is induced by [CONTACT_842638].  Subjects will be explained that  they  will hear recordings of spoken 
sentences through  headphones at random  intervals  while in  the scanner. Each stimulus will be  presented 
over an  otherwise silent  epoch, which will be followed by a  short noisy imaging acquisition period. Right 
when the latter finishes, they will be  asked if they heard any voices immediately before  the scanner noise 
started and they would need press a button to indicate so. They will be instructed that the content of the sentences will be  explicit in some cases and they will listen  to the recordings before the scanning session.  
Before each of the  two sessions in the scanner,  participants will have a training session  in a computer 
outside of  the scanner. The training session will last about 30 minutes.
Although our MRI Scans are for research purposes (and not  clinical purposes),  a credentialed, board-
certified radiologist  will perform a  clinical  reading for gross structural abnormalities on every MRI within [ADDRESS_1171110] will 
provide an oral report followed by a written  note to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_842624]. A  written report 
will be provided  within two weeks of the oral  report.  Results of the MRI  will be  provided to  the volunteers 
by a study physician.  Volunteers can opt to  receive a letter  regarding  the results  of the MRI  on the consent 
forms. Participants  requesting a letter will receive one using the language provided  by [CONTACT_1201].
 
 
Treatment
 
Only patients  in the  AH+ sample will receive tDCS  treatment. Prior to the first treatment, all  female  subjects  
will receive  a pregnancy test.  Stimulation will be performed using a  battery-driven BrainStim SYS 
(Brainvision LLC, [LOCATION_013]), and transferred through two 7x5 cm sponge electrodes soaked in a saline solution (0.9% NaCl).  In accordance with a recent tDCS study (21) showing beneficial  effects of tDCS 
stimulation in reducing  AVH in hallucinating  schizophrenia patients, we will use a similar stimulation

montage. In the active  tDCS condition the  cathodal  electrode will be placed over the left temporoparietal 
junction, and the  anodal electrode  will be placed over right DLPFC. In accordance with  recent  studies  of 
tDCS in other psychiatric  or neurological illnesses(22-24), the stimulation level will be set  at [ADDRESS_1171111] 3 hours. In  sham stimulation,  electrodes  are located in the same  positions as in 
active stimulation  and the same  fade  in/fade  out ramp will be applied and the constant  current  will last only 
30 s. Small current pulses will also occur infrequently (every  550 ms, 110 mA over 15 ms) through  the 
remainder of  the 20-minute session to produce similar stimulation sensation between conditions.  During the  
treatment sessions, subjects will be  allowed  to watch  a silent  movie or read material  of their  choice.  
Treatments will  be administered by a  trained,  BA-level research  assistant under  supervision of an MD.  The  
RA will  undergo a  progression of graduating  steps consisting of observation, implementation under 
supervision, and  implementation with guidance.

Safety:
We will monitor for potential adverse  events of tDCS with the Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale  
(WBFPRS, Figure).  The WBFPRS is readily  understood by [CONTACT_842639].  
Additionally, we will monitor discomfort  and potential objective adverse effects of tDCS (e.g. skin 
redness) as  suggested by "Brunoni AR,  Amadera J, Berbel  B, Volz  MS,  Rizzerio BG, Fregni F. A systematic  
review on reporting and assessment of adverse effects associated with transcranial direct current stimulation. Int J Neuropsychopharmacol. 2011;14:1133-45: (Figure 2).  Any  score  rated at a 3 or greater in  severity will 
require immediate evaluation by a qual ified member  of the clinical team ([CONTACT_842653]).  Both are 
familiar with Brain stimulation procedures.    
In these cases, the  psychiatrist will check in via phone with the subject the following day, and  then  as 
clinically indicated. 
 
Additionally, subjects  will receive the CGI-I  scale  prior to  each treatment session  to evaluate clinical 
stability. Additionally, at  baseline and  after the final treatment, patients will undergo pure tone 
audiometry testing for safety  screening.  If a change  in auditory threshold is discovered, the treating 
physician will  inform  the patient  and discuss  whether or not  to continue with treatment. Furthermore, if  a 
change is discovered,  the patient’s hearing will be tested again  periodically  until either it returns baseline or 
the clinician determines  that the change is permanent. 
 
Post-treatment Assessments
 
Immediately following  completion of last treatment, patients in  the AH+ sample will have [ADDRESS_1171112] repeat of 
baseline behavioral and ERP methods. Behavioral assessments will also be  repeated at  1- and  3-month 
follow-up timepoints.  Response  to treatment  will be defined as >15%  reduction in  AHRS  score. After the 
completion of the 3 month visit, subjects will be offered the opportunity to do  one week of optional, 
open label active treatment using identical procedures to the blinded treatment. Subjects will be seen once after the week of open treatment  for a follow-up visit

tDCS is thought to work in part by [CONTACT_842640]( Fritsch B, Reis J,  Martinowich K,  Schambra HM, 
Ji Y, Cohen LG, Lu  B. Direct current stimulation promotes BDNF-dependent  synaptic plasticity: potential 
implications for motor learning. Neuron.  2010;66:198-204. PM#2864780). Furthermore, plasma BDNF is 
known to correlate with  CSF BDNF (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_24124] A, Kale A, Joshi S, Naphade N, Raju MS,  Nasrallah  H, Mahadik 
SP. Decreased  BDNF levels in CSF  of drug-naive first-epi[INVESTIGATOR_842625]: correlation  with plasma 
BDNF and psychopathology.  Int J Neuropsychopharmacol. 2010;13:535-9) and so represents an appropriate 
reflection of potential effects of  tDCS  on CNS plasticity. We predict that an  increase in  plasma  BDNF  may 
serve as  a marker of  "adequate" tDCS.  D-serine is an endogenous  modulator of NMDAR function that is 
known to modulate dendritic architecture in brain (Balu DT, Coyle JT. Neuronal  D-serine regulates 
dendritic architecture in the somatosensory cortex. Neurosci Lett. 2012;517:77-81. PM#3400345). D-serine synthesis is  dynamically regulated by [CONTACT_842641] (e.g. nitric oxide)  that also affect  brain  plasticity (1. Darra  
E, Ebner  FH, Shoji K, Suzuki H, Mariotto S. Dual cross-talk between  nitric oxide and  D-serine in  astrocytes 
and neurons in the brain.  Cent Nerv  Syst  Agents Med Chem. 2009;9:289-94) . Although there is less 
literature regarding  effects of tDCS on D-serine regulation, nevetheless addition of this  measurement  (which 
is done by [CONTACT_842642]) adds little expense to the study  and does not require additional phlebotomy. We 
postulate that successful tDCS will be accompanied by [CONTACT_67191] D-serine  release and possibly dendritic  
rearrangement in brain, and will be reflected in peripheral (plasma) D-serine concentrations.
 
 
In reviewing  the literature, we  note that there is also evidence that  BDNF  gene polymorphisms affect 
response to tDCS (Antal A,  Chaieb  L, Moliadze  V, Monte-Silva  K, Poreisz C,  
Thirugnanasambandam N, Nitsche  MA, Shoukier M, Ludwig H,  Paulus W.  Brain-derived 
neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene polymorphisms shape cortical plasticity in humans.  Brain Stimul. 
2010;3:230-7). It  has also been demonstrated  that individuals with common  polymorphisms of the 
BDNF gene may show differential response to tDCS enhancement of brain  plasticity. Thus, for both  
facilitatory tDCS (24 subjects, 10 heterozygotes)  and inhibitory tDCS (19  subjects, 8 heterozygotes), 
carriers of  the Val66Met allele displayed enhanced  plasticity. In the present study, we will perform a 
secondary analysis to evaluate whether Val66 Met carriers show preferential response to  tDCS 
treatment.

Risks/Discomforts/Inconveniences 
Risks that  could be  encountered during the study period
MRI
 
There are no known risks to the use of MRI per  se. However, three areas  of concern are  addressed in  the 
next section. The first is the safety risk posed by [CONTACT_842643]. The  second  is the discomfort some subjects experience during  confinement within  
the bore  of the MRI system. The third is the loud noise made by [CONTACT_842644].  These risks 
occur for all clinical MRI exams and are not increased by [CONTACT_350405]. The  images  obtained  from 
structural and functional scanning are automatically transferred from the scanner to  a workstation that strips 
potentially identifying  data from the  image headers, writes the data as image  volumes identified by [CONTACT_842645]
[ADDRESS_1171115]  to specific absorption 
ratio (SAR),  limits on gradient slew rate  (dB/dt),  and noise. Having ascertained  the absence of implanted 
metal foreign objects  using the aforementioned screening form, subjects and staff  remove all other metal 
objects, including clothing  with metal clasps, before  entering the magnet room. The magnetic properties of 
unknown material  are tested outside the  magnet room with  a strong permanent magnet. Participants and 
staff are also  instructed to enter the  magnet  room slowly and to  pause at the entrance to determine if  any 
items on their person  may be pulling toward  the magnet. Participants  wear insert earplugs  during  scanning 
to reduce noise levels below FDA limits. General Electric engineers have  recently measured the sound  
levels within  our scanners and have  determined that it  is compliant with FDA  guidelines.
    Some people have reported sensations during  MRI  scans, such as "tingling" or "twitching" (or,  very  
rarely, a painful sensation),  which  are caused by [CONTACT_842646]. In our experience, no one  has had sensations from the MRI that did not stop when the scanning 
stopped. An  acute risk of burns to the skin is presented by [CONTACT_842647], and participants will be 
asked to remove patches  before entering the scanner. Some  participants may  feel uncomfortable or confined 
once positioned within the bore of the  MRI  system and it may cause  some  subjects to feel anxious.
 
 
Evaluation
 
Patients with schizophrenia  may experience some discomfort as a  result of questions asked during  the 
psychiatric evaluation, but this should be comparable  to their experiences in standard care. For participants 
recruited for the AH+ sample who receive  a blood draw: occasionally, redness or a bruise  may develop at 
the site  where blood was drawn.  If this occurs,  it will usually disappear in a few days. Some people  become 
dizzy and faint when  their blood is drawn.
 
tDCS (AH+  Sample Only)
 
Since the development of  tDCS in the 1960’s, hundreds of subjects have  participated  in studies and received 
tDCS without any adverse effects.  There  has been no evidence of  neuronal  damage  induced  by [CONTACT_32101]: in two 
evaluations, Nitsche and colleagues  (25, 26) found no elevation of neurone-specific enolase (sensitive 
marker of neuronal damage).  McCreery  et al.,(27)  demonstrated  that current densities below 25mA/cm2  do 
not induce brain tissue damage even  by [CONTACT_219650]-frequency stimulation over several hours. In our 
protocol, we  stimulate with a maximum current  density of 0.057 mA/cm2, a  thousand  fold below this limit. 
Duration of stimulation is an additional factor contributing to  potential  tissue damage, which has been 
detected at a minimum total charge of  216 C/cm2 (28). (Total charge=current density  x stimulation 
duration.) This protocol exposes subjects to maximum total charges of 0.022 C/cm2, which  is far below the  
established safety threshold. Iyer  et al. (29)  demonstrated the safety of tDCS applied  at 1mA and  2mA for  
20 minutes to normal  subjects and noted some enhancement  of verbal  fluency after 2mA of stimulation, but 
no adverse events.  A recent study (30) has demonstrated the safety of  1mA of cathodal  tDCS  for [ADDRESS_1171116]. Fregni  et al, in May 2006 (31), report that patients suffering  from central pain 
secondary to traumatic spi[INVESTIGATOR_842626] 2mA for  [ADDRESS_1171117]  reported a sunburn like sensation under the electrodes while current  was 
turned on. This has sometimes persisted for an  hour or more after the current  was turned off. Mild  scabbing 
has also been observed under an electrode, which resolved after a  few days. Both of these events  (sunburn  
like sensation and  scabbing) appear  to be related to drying out  of the sponge electrodes, which we learned 
from another investigator working with  tDCS. Since then we have  kept the sponges  sufficiently moist, and 
irritation has been minimal or absent, while scabbing has not recurred.Some subjects may  also experience mild nausea during or after the stimulation. In a study involving one-
hundred and two  subjects, 2.9% of the participants reported feeling  nauseous after receiving tDCS (32).
Reported side effects of tDCS include reddening of the skin under the electrodes (reported in two subjects with recently shaved  heads) and  itching under the electrode  sites  while the current was turned on. 
 
Genetics: there  are potential  dangers  in releasing DNA information, such as jeopardy to  insurability (risk to  
ability to obtain insurance), discrimination  against  employers, landlords and others.  
 
 
Describe procedures  for minimizing risks
tDCS
 
Routine safety procedures are in place  to screen  subjects prior to  scanning, maintain security of the 
restricted access areas, and ensure that system security features are in  good working order.
To minimize chemical reactions at the electrode-skin interface, non-metallic,  conductive rubber electrodes, 
covered completely with saline-soaked sponges will be used, as recommended by [CONTACT_305876], 2000 (33).Electrode sponges will be  kept moist in order to avoid skin irritation.
A research physician will be present  at all times to monitor patient  safety.
Operation of  cellular (wireless) devices,  telephones,  or two-way radios  may  produce changes in device 
output, and thus should not be used in close  proximity  (< 1m).  
We do not apply  electrodes over  broken  or irritated skin. 
The use of  other stimulation electrodes during the treatment period will be  avoided. 
Lead wires are configured so that they cannot  be plugged into power outlets such as wall sockets and  line 
cord receptacles. 
 
 
MRI
 
In order  to minimize risks and discomforts to participants, we will:
- Screen  for metallic devices,  implants and  other contraindications to scanning by [CONTACT_2329] a screening 
questionnaire.

Genetics: blood samples will be coded.  No personal  identification will link subjects with the blood  sample, 
and the genetic information  will not be made available to  anyone (including the subject and their  physician). 
We will apply  for a  certificate  of confidentiality as an additional protection.
 
 
 
Methods to Protect Confidentiality
Describe methods  to protect confidentiality
All data (written and electronic) will be coded by [CONTACT_6227]. Personal identifying  information will be sorted  in 
an electronically secure  database at [LOCATION_001] Psychiatric Institute.  A master list matching  subjects  with 
codes will  be kept under lock and key, separate  from any research records or the computer database, with 
access restricted to research staff,  to the extent permitted by [CONTACT_2371]. Only staff directly involved  in this project 
will have access to  the master list linking subject  names  to code numbers. In the informed consent form, 
subjects are told that the  information they provide and all  findings  of testing will be  kept strictly 
confidential, with  access  limited to the research staff, and possibly  state or federal regulatory personnel.  
Subject data will  be kept in a computer,  but the subject’s name [CONTACT_842651].  The 
information will only be  linked to a code number assigned for the purpose of maintaining privacy. Only 
members of  the research  team will have access to the computer.
Will the  study be  conducted under  a certificate of confidentiality?

Name [CONTACT_3261]:  Amantadine hydrochloride  
Title of Study: Open -Label Safety Study of ADS -5102 (amantadine HCl) Extended Release 
Capsules for the Treatment of Levodopa  Induced Dyskinesia  
Study center(s):  Approximately 90 sites worldwide  
Study Duration:  Approximately 37 months (from 
enrollment  of first subject to last subject completion  
[LSLV] ) Phase of development: 3 
 
Objectives:  
Primary:  
 To evaluate the safety and tolerability of ADS -5102 oral capsules, an extended 
release formulation of amantadine, administered at a dose of 340 mg once nightly  
at bedtime  for the treatment of levodopa  induced dyskinesia (LID) in subjects 
with Parkinson’s disease (PD).  
Secondary:  
 To evaluate duration of ADS -[ADDRESS_851502] on dyskinesia as assessed by [CONTACT_234055]’s Disease Rating Scale ( MDS -UPDRS ), Part IV . 
 To evaluate clinical progression  of Parkinson’s disease as assessed by [CONTACT_274657] -
UPDRS, Combined Score, Parts I , II, and III . 
Study Design:   
This study will be offered to subjects who are described b y one of the following 3 groups:  
 Group 1 ( current Adamas  LID study subjects ): Subjects who are participating in 
Adamas efficacy studies evaluating ADS -5102 in LID and choose to immediately 
transition into ADS -AMT -PD302 without a  time gap; 
 Group 2 ( previous Adamas  LID study subjects): Subjects who  have  previously  
participated in Adamas efficacy studies evaluating ADS -5102 in LID and  will 
enter ADS -AMT -PD302 after a time gap; 
 Group 3 ( non Adamas  LID study subjects with prior DBS ): Subjects who would 
have been deemed ineligible for participation in previous  or current  Adamas 
efficacy studies due to having undergone deep brain stimulation .

 (Amendment 4) Page 3 of 74 
 
CONFIDENTIAL and PROPRIETARY  Detailed inclusion/exclusion criteria and a schedule of events are described in this protoc ol 
Section 7  and Appendix  A, respectively for each of these groups : 
 Current Adamas LID study subjects (Group 1) should have their Screening Visit 
(Visit 1), including consent, for the ADS -AMT -PD302 study occur at the same 
visit as the final  efficacy visit for the previous Adamas efficacy study, as outlined 
in the previous protocol. Subsequently, t hey should also have their Baseline Visit 
(Visit 2) for the ADS -AMT -PD302 study occur during the final study visit (not 
including any safety follow up visit) of the previous Adamas efficacy study visit, 
as outlined in the previous protocol.  
 Previous Adamas  LID study subjects (Group 2) and Non Adamas LID study 
subjects with prior DBS (Group 3) will not have overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_636909] . 
A study design schematic for study entry differences between these groups can be found in 
Appendix  B.   
Consented subjects who complete screening (Visit 1) and meet study eligibility criteria will 
have a baseline visit (Visit 2) and receive 1 week of 170  mg ADS -5102 (1 capsule) nightly at 
bedtime, followed by 340 mg ADS -5102 (2 capsules) nightly at bedtime for up to  99 
additional weeks. The final week (  Week 101) of dosing will be at the reduced dose of  
170 mg ADS -5102 (1 capsule) nightly at bedtime.   
Subjects will be enrolled into the study at Visit 2 (Week 0, Baseline) and return to the clinic 
after 4, 8, 16, 28, 40,  52, 64, 76, 88,  and 100 weeks dosing.   Subjects will receive a 
telephone reminder at the end of Week 1 to increase their dose to two ca psules nightly at 
bedtime .  At the Week 100 visit, subjects will be instructed to reduce their dose for 1 week, 
taking 1 capsule nightly at bedtime.   
An efficacy assessment using the MDS -UPDRS will be completed at all study visits, 
beginning with the Scre ening Visit, with the exception of the Baseline/Week [ADDRESS_851503] an early termination visit 
that includes MDS -UPDRS assessments and safety follow -up.   
Subjects who discontinue study drug after Week 4 should receive a reduced dose of 170 mg 
ADS -5102 for one additional week.  The additional week of dosing at a reduced dose will not 
be needed for subjects who discontinue study drug before Week 4.  
Adverse events (AEs) will be recorded beginning with the first dose of study drug and will 
continue through the safety follow -up visit.  Concomitant medications will be recorded 
throughout the study.

CONFIDENTIAL and PROPRIETARY  Methodology:   
The safety analysis population will include all enrolled subjects who receive at least one dose 
of study drug.  Safety data will be summarized from the time of first dose and include all 
available safety data.  No formal statistical testing will be done.  
All AE data will be listed and will be summarized by [CONTACT_9313], preferred term, and 
analysis group, as well as for all analysis groups combined.   Quantitative safety variables 
(e.g., vital signs and clinical laboratory tests) will be summarized at each visit by [CONTACT_216348], as well as for all analysis groups combined  and changes from baseline will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_636923].  
The efficacy analysis population will include all enrolled subjects who receive at least one 
dose o f study drug and provide at least one post -enrollment MDS -UPDRS assessment.  
MDS -UPDRS, Part IV and Combined Score, Parts I, II, and III data will be summarized 
across study visits and include all available data.  The baseline MDS -UPDRS score s for a 
subjec t will be their MDS -UPDRS scores from the Screening Visit.  
Sample Size Justification:  
It is expected that a study size of  up to 250  subjects and duration of treatment up to 101 
weeks will support the goal of 100 subjects completing one year of treatment.

CONFIDENTIAL and PROPRIETARY  4. INTRODUCTION 
Parkinson's disease is a chronic, progressive disorder with prominent motor signs including 
tremors, rigidity, bradykinesia and postural instability.  Levodopa is the most commonly 
prescribed and effective drug treatment for symptomatic relief in PD; however, chronic treatment 
with levodopa often results in the emergence of dose-limiting motor side-effects, including 
abnormal involuntary movements known as LID.  With continued levodopa treatment, and as PD 
progresses, LID can become severely disabling and has been associated with a decrease in t
he 
quality of life (Encarnacion et al., 2008).  There are currently no medications approved for the 
treatment of LID, thus there is a significant unmet medical need for new treatments for this 
condition. 
Dyskinesia 
can be an adverse effect of all dopaminergic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], but mostly related to t
he use 
of levodopa ( Del Sorbo et al., 2008).  LID can be diagnosed by [CONTACT_636926].  The most 
common type of LID is referred to as “pe
ak-dose dyskinesia” and usually consists of 
stereotypi[INVESTIGATOR_636912], trunk, and/or limbs.  Movement 
disorder specialists have developed rating scales to evaluate dyskinesia for purposes of clinical 
diagnosis and cli
nical trial investigation (Goetz et al., 2008 ; Colosimo et al., 2010 ; Goetz et al., 
2013 ). 
The incidence of LID reported in the literature, including reports of individual studies, varies 
widely (Duvoisin 1974 ; Parkinson Study Group 1989 ; Parkinson Study Group 1996 ; Thanvi et 
al., 2007).  Based on published studies utilizing a Medicare beneficiaries’ database, IMS 
prescribing data, and demographic studies presented in the peer-reviewed literature, we have 
estimated a prevalence of approximately 140,000 Parkinson’s patients with LID.  
The underlying cause of LID is unknown, but the pulsatile administration of levodopa treatment 
and the degree of denerva
tion in the striatum appear to influence its development ( Del Sorbo et 
al., 2008).  Other factors that have been associated with a higher incidence and severity of LID 
include early age of onset of PD, longer duration of levodopa treatment, levodopa total exposure, 
female gender, and genetic factors.  The preferential use of dopamine agonists in the treatment of 
early disease and the careful management of pulsatile effects of levodopa therapy can delay but 
not eliminate the development of LID.  
Amantadine IR, which is approved for the treatment of PD, is used off-label by [CONTACT_636927].  A number of 
literature reports suggest amantadine is effective for the treatment of LID ( Verhagen et al., 1998; 
Verhagen et al., 1999; Luginger et al., 2000; Snow et al.,  2000; Paci et al. 2001 ; Thomas et al., 
2004 ; da Silva-Junior et al.,  2005; Sawada et al.,  2010 ; Wolf et al., 2010; Goetz et al., 2013).  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_636913]’s reported utility in the treatment of LID, until recently, the drug was
 not 
ex
tensively studied in well-controlled clinical trials that meet evidence-based clinical or 
regulatory standa
rds of acceptance, nor was the optimal dose for this indication established.  The 
majority of patients with PD tolerate 200 mg/day of the amantadine IR formulation; however, the 
available literatur
e on amantadine for the treatment of LID indicates that higher doses of 
amantadine produce a greater reduction in LID symptoms ( Verhagen et al., 1998; Luginger et al. , 
2000 ).  However, the increased frequency of adverse events (AEs) at higher doses, in particular 
central nervous system (CNS) events and sleep disturbances, limits the routine use of amantadine

CONFIDENTIAL and PROPRIETARY  IR at doses of 300 mg/day or higher ( Tyrrell et al., 1964; Jackson et al., 1967; Hayden et al., 
1981 ). 
4.1. Product Rationale 
The pharmacologic rationale for a formulation that slows the release of amantadine is based upon 
the nature and timing of amantadine IR CNS side effects relative to dosing as well as 
observations with other CNS active drugs.  Symmetrel (amantadine HCl IR tablet) has a short 
tmax of 2-4 hours (Aoki et al., 1988), and the most commonly reported side effects are CNS 
related, including dizziness (lightheadedness), agitation, hallucinations, and insomnia which can 
occur wit
hin a few hours of dosing (Hayden 1981; Jackson et al., 1967 ).  These side effects may 
explain why amantadine is usually administ
ered in divided doses, despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a 16 hour half-life, 
which would typi[INVESTIGATOR_636914].  Moreover, the CNS effects are particularly 
disruptive late in the day or evening (following a second or third amantadine dose) as the patient 
is trying to sleep ( Tyrrell et al., 1964; Jackson et al.,  1967 ). 
In addition to amantadine, there are other CNS active stimulant drugs, such as methylphenidate 
and cocaine that have high blood brain permeability (CNS penetrants), and exhibit a short t max.  
By [CONTACT_636928], the type 
and timing of the CNS effects can be modulated ( Volkow et al., 1998; Swanson et al., 2002; 
Spencer et al., 2006).  Hence, the pharmacologic rationale for improved tolerabilit
y o
f an 
extended-release formulation of amantadine is that the reduction in the rate of rise in pla
sma 
concentration may reduce the CNS adverse effects that can occur shortly after dosing, without 
compromising concentration-dependent efficacy. 
4.2. Dose and Dose Regimen Justification 
The proposed dose of amantadine HCl in ADS-[ADDRESS_851517] of amantadine on sleep. This pharmacokinetic profile could enable higher daily 
doses to be tole
rated with a once-nightly ER preparation than can be tolerated with an IR 
formulation. The once-nightly dosing regimen may also provide enhanced c
onvenience and 
improve compliance.  The labeled dose of Symmetrel for initiating treatment of PD is 100 mg 
given twice daily.  The label also allows for an increase of up to 400 mg daily in divided doses 
for patients whose respo
nses are not optimal with 200 mg daily.  Figure 1 shows 
pharmacokinetic modeling of the steady state exposure for the ADS-5102 formulation compared 
to the approved doses of amantadine IR. Profiles were generated from Adamas clinical data in 
healthy volunteers (NPI-5103-C101).

CONFIDENTIAL and PROPRIETARY  Figure 1: Pharmacokinetic Modeling of Steady-state Concentrations for ADS-5102 vs 
Approved Doses of Amantadine IR   
 
ADS -5102 administered as 340 mg once-nightly
 results in a PK profile that provides higher 
exposures than possible with 100 mg bid amantadine IR, and yet remains within those approved 
in the Symmetrel package insert.  As seen in Figure 1, the C max of the recommended dose of 
ADS -5102 remains below that of the 200 mg amantadine IR bid. The minimal concentration 
after dosing with ADS-5102 remains above the C max from a 100 mg dose of amantadine IR. 
4.3. Summary Pharmacokinetic Information for Extended Release 
Amantadine Formulations 
4.3.1.  Single Dose Studies 
In a single-dose trial, the PK performance of 3 amantadine ER formulations [labeled A, B  
(ADS-5101), and C (ADS-5102)] was studied in healthy volunteers (Study No. NPI-5103-C-
101).  The study demonstrated that all 3 ER amantadine formulations had lower C max and longer 
tmax compared to IR amantadine.  Relative bioavailability (based on AUC 0-inf) of amantadine 
ER formulations A, B, and C compared to IR amantadine was 85.3%, 94.6%, and 88.5%, 
respectively.

-PD302 (Amendment 4) Page [ADDRESS_851518] of Food on Bioavailability of Amantadine ER  
Two single-dose crossover studies (study NPI-5101- FE-103 and study ADS-5101-106) 
established the lack of effect of food on pharmacokinetics and one stud
y demonstrated that 
administering the A
DS-5101 capsule contents sprinkled on applesauce  
(Study NPI-5101- FE-106) does not affect the bioavailability of amantadine. 
When study medication was administered after a standard meal, absorption of amantadine wa
s 
faster, with slightly higher peak concentration and 1 hour earlier median t max value as compared 
with the reference fasted treatment.  The 90% CIs of the ratio of the least squares geometric 
mean for C max, AUC 0-t, and AUC 0-∞ fell within the 80.00% to 125.00% interval for each test 
treatment (fed and sprinkled) relative to the reference treatment (fasted condition).  The results 
from these studies support dosing recommendations that amantadine ER can be administered 
with food and can be sprinkled on applesauce. 
Steady state pharmacokinetic data are not available for ADS-5102.  One of the objectives of this 
study is to measure steady state amantadine concentrations at the three dose levels. 
4.3.3.  Relative Bioavailability of Amantadine ER vs. Amantadine IR at Steady State 
Two multiple dose studies were conducted with similar study designs: NPI-5101- MD-104 which 
studied a daily dose of 200 mg (two 100 mg ADS-5101 capsules administered once d
aily), and 
ADS -5101-105 which used a dose of 220 mg (two 110 mg ADS-5101 capsules administered 
once daily).  Both studies were 2-treatment, 2-period crossover, single and multiple-dose PK 
studies comparing once-daily ADS 5101 and twice–daily amantadine IR (2 x 100 mg) in healthy 
adults under fasting conditions.  In each trial, a single dose of the reference
 (2 x 100 mg 
amantadine IR) and test (200 mg or 220 mg ADS-5101) substance was administered, followe
d 
by 48 hours of plasma sampling to characterize the single dose pharmacokinetic profile.  The 
subjects were then administered 7 days of study drugs (amantadine IR, 100 mg bid or  
ADS -5101, 200 or 220 mg qd), and the steady state pharmacokinetic profile was assessed.  
Following a seven day washout, the subjects were crossed over to the alternate test regimens. 
Similar PK results were observed on Day [ADDRESS_851519] linear kinetics 
over time for both the IR and ER formulations. 
4.4. Summary Safety Information for Extended Release Amantadine 
Formulations  
The safety of amantadine ER formulation has been examined in approximately 120 healthy 
subjects in the five single dose Phase 1 studies and 61 patients in one repeated dose Phase 2/[ADDRESS_851520] frequently occurring adverse events 
reported with the ER formulations of amantadine were headache, fatigue, and dizziness, 
occurring in 5-10% of subjects.  The majority of adverse events were categorized as mild. There 
were no serious adverse events in any of the trials to date, and no deaths were reported.  No 
meaningful trends were observed for serum chemistry, hematology, or urinalysis results. 
In the Phase 2/[ADDRESS_851521] of 
ADS -5102 for Treatment of LID  16 July 2015  
Adamas Pharmaceuticals, Inc.              Protocol ADS-AMT
-PD302 (Amendment 4) Page 23 of 74 
 
CONFIDENTIAL and PROPRIETARY  these AEs were mild to moderate.  Five patients had serious adverse events, and no deaths were 
reported. No meaningful trends were observed for serum chemistry, hematology, or urinalysis 
results. 
In all the amantadine ER studies, the reported adverse events were generally consistent with the 
known safety profile of amantadine.

Subjects who withdraw from the study will not be replaced. 
7.4. Subject Enrollment 
All subjects must sign and date an IRB/REB/IEC-approved ICF before any study procedures, 
including screening procedures, are performed.  During screening, the investigator or designee is 
to assess the need and requirements for a caregiver and/or study partner during the course of the 
study, and to assure the commitment of the person(s) so designated.  It is preferable that the 
involved caregiver remains consistent during study participation; however, if circumstances 
require that the involved caregiver changes, he/she must undergo appropriate training prior to 
assisting the subject in completion of study assessments. 
Subjects will be considered enrolled into the study after they have signed the ICF, have met all 
study mandated inclusion/exclusion criteria, and are enrolled at Visit 2 (Week 0, Baseline). 
7.5. Discontinuation of Study Medication   
Subjects who discontinue study dru
g after Week 4 should receive a reduced dose for one 
additional week of ADS-5102 before stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_11743].  The additional week of dosing at a 
reduced dose will not be needed for subjects who discontinue study drug before Week 4. 
Subjects should discontinue study medication if judged necessary by [CONTACT_4687], 
and reasons may include any of the following: 
 Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) falls below 50 mL/min/1.73m2, 
confirmed by [CONTACT_15013]. (see Section 6.4)  
NOTE:  
 Subjects whose eGFR falls below 30 mL/min/1.73m2 while on study should 
discontinue study drug without the additional week at a reduced dose. 
 Need to take a medication that is excluded or that may interfere with study 
measurements 
 Intolerable or unacceptable AEs 
 Positive pregnancy test 
If the subject decides to discontinue study drug, they will have an early termination visit that 
includes efficacy assessments and safety follow-up.

1.1. Screening/Day - 14 to -1 
During screening, potential subjects for the study will be fully informed about the nature of the 
study and possible adverse events (AEs).  Subjects who wish to participate in the study must read 
and understand the consent form and sign the document after the investigator has answered all 
questions to the candidat
e’s satisfaction.  Further procedures can begin only after the consent 
form has been signed.  
The Screening Visit must be conducted within 14 days prior to Day 1.   
NOTE: If a subject from a previous Adamas LID study wishes to enroll directly in ADS-AMT-
P
D302 without a time  gap, they should have their Screening Visit (Visit 1), including consent, 
for the ADS-AMT-PD302 study occur during the final efficacy study visit for the previous 
Adamas efficacy study, as outlined in the previous protocol.  
Per the Schedule of Events in
 Appendix A , if a subject is directly rolling over to the ope
n label 
extension, a number of common assessments between the Adamas efficacy study visit and the 
Screening
 Visit (ADS-AMT-PD302) only need to be performed once.  
Potential stud
y subjects will be evaluated for entry into the study according to the stated 
inclusion and exc
lusion criteria.  Individuals who are identified during this screening as not 
eligible for study enrollment need not complete all screening procedures.   The reason for 
ineligible status is to be documented.

12. ADVERSE AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS 
During the study, the Inve
stigator or study site personnel will be responsible for querying and 
recording adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), as detailed in this section of 
the protocol.  In this study AEs and SAEs will be reported from the time of study drug 
administration until the last study visit or death, whichever occurs first. 
12.1. Definition of Adverse Events 
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence that occurs in conjunction with the 
use of a medicinal product in humans, whether or not considered to have a causal relationship to 
the medicinal product.  An AE can, therefore, be any unfavorable or unintended sign (includi
ng a 
clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated 
with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. 
ADS -5102 for Treatment of LID  16 July 2015  
Adamas Pharmaceuticals, Inc.              Protocol ADS-AMT-PD302
 (Amendment 4) Page 49 of 74 
 
CONFIDENTIAL and PROPRIETARY  12.1.1. Adverse Event (AE) 
Any medical condition or clinically significant laboratory abnormality with an onset date before 
the first date of study drug administration is usually considered to be pre-existing, and should not 
be documented in the CRF as an AE. 
Any AE (i.e., a new event or an exacerbati
on of a pre-existing condition) with an onset date after 
study drug administration up to and including the designated follow-up safety visit should be 
recorded as an AE on the CRF.  All AEs must be recorded on the AE CRF regardless of the 
severity or relationship to study medication.  It is important that Investigators also report all AEs 
that result in permanent discontinuation of the study drug being studied, whether serious or non-
serious. 
An AE does  include: 
 an exacerbation of a pre-existing illness; 
 an increase in frequency or intensity of a pre-existing epi[INVESTIGATOR_3756]; 
 a condition detected or diagnosed after study drug administration even though it may 
have been present prior to the start of the study; 
 persistent disease or symptoms present at baseline which worsen following the start of 
the study. 
An AE does not  include: 
 medical or surgical procedures (e.g., surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, transfusion) 
Note:  in this case, the condition that led to the procedure is an AE; 
 pre-existing diseases or conditions present or detected prior to start of study drug 
administration, which do not worsen; 
 the disease or disorder being studied or a sign or symptom associated with that disease 
(i.e., signs or symptoms associated with lack of efficacy will generally be considered to 
reflect underlying disease, rather than AEs); 
 situations where an untoward medical occurrence has not occurred (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_89783], social, and/or convenience admissions); 
 overdose of either study drug or concomitant medication without any signs or symptoms. 
(Dosing details will be recorded on the appropriate eCRF(s)). 
The Investigator should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on the signs, 
symptoms and/or other clinical information.  In such cases, the diagnosis should be documented 
as the AE (and SAE if serious) and not the individual signs/symptoms. 
All AEs must be fully and completely documented on the AE page of the CRF and in the 
subject’s medical notes.  The following attributes must be assigned: description of AE, dates and 
times of onset and resolution (or whether ongoing), severity (Section 12.1.2), causality to study 
drug ( Section 12.2), whether an SAE or not ( Section 12.1.4 ), and action taken (i.e., no action 
taken; study medication interrupted; study medication discontinued; other).

Adamas Pharmaceuticals, Inc.              Protocol ADS-AMT-PD302
 (Amendment 4) Page [ADDRESS_851538] a nonspecific question (e.g., “Have you noticed 
anything different since your last visit?”) to assess whether any AEs have occurred since the last 
report or visit.  AEs will be identified and documented on the AE page of the CRF in appropriate 
medical terminology. 
12.1.2. Severity of Adverse Events 
The severity of each AE/SAE should be classified into one of three defined categories as 
follows: 
 Mild:   the AE is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423], causes minimal discomfort, and does not 
interfere in a significant manner with the subject’s normal functioning level or activities;   
 Moderate:   the AE is sufficiently uncomfortable to interfere with normal ever yday 
activities , but is not hazardous to health;   
 Severe:   the AE produces significant impairment of functioning or incapacitation and is a 
definite hazard to the subject’s health. 
These three categories are based on the investigator’s clinical judgment, which in turn depends 
on consideration of various factors such as the subject’s reports, the physician’s observations, 
and the physician’s prior experience.  The severity of the AE should be recorded in the 
appropriate section on the AE page of the CRF.   
The evaluation of severity must be distinguished from the evaluation of “seriousness” (see 
Section 12.1.4).   A severe event might not meet the criteria for seriousness and a serious event 
might be evaluated as mild or moderate.  For example, a subject might have a severe  headache 
that does not require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_128020] ; or a subject might have a 
mild  myocardial infarction that requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_636918] . 
12.1.3. Follow-up of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Even ts 
All AEs and SAEs must be followed until resolution (or return to baseline status), or until the 
condition stabilizes or is otherwise explained, or until the subject dies or is lost to follow-up.  
The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that follow-up includes any supplemental 
investigations as may be indicated to elucidate as completely as practical the nature and/or 
causality of the AE/SAE.  This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, 
histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals. 
The sponsor may request that the Investigator perform or arrange for the conduct of 
supplemental measurements and/or evaluations.  If a subject dies during participation in the 
study or during a recognized follow-up period, the Investigator should provide the Sponsor with 
a copy of any post-mortem findings, including histopathology.

 (Amendment 4) Page 51 of 74 
 
CONFIDENTIAL and PROPRIETARY  12.1.4. Serious Adverse Event (SAE) 
A serious adverse event  (SAE) is any AE occurring at any dose that: 
 results in death; 
 is life-threatening (subject is at immediate risk of death at the time of the event); 
 requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_316886]; 
 results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; 
 is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a subject who received study drug; 
 is a significant or important medical event, i.e., an event that, based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the above mentioned criteria (examples of such events are 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse). 
When a causality assessment is provided for an SAE, it is important to include a rationale for the 
assessment, so that a better understanding of the reported event can be compi[INVESTIGATOR_42602].  The rationale 
should be accompanied by [CONTACT_209789], including relevant laboratory tests, 
histopathology evaluations, and the results of other diagnostic procedures.  The Investigator’s 
rationa
le with supporting evidence is valuable when the Sponsor performs a cumulative analysis 
of similar events. 
A Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) is any serious adverse event that is 
considered related to the investigational product, and that is also unexpected.  S[LOCATION_003]Rs qualify 
for expedited reporting to applicable Health Authorities, Eudravigilance, and IRB/REB/IECs. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Clarification of SAE Definition 
“Occurring at any dose” does not imply that the subject is receiving study drug at the time of the 
event.  Dosing may have been interrupted temporarily prior to the onset of the SAE, but may 
have contributed to the event. 
“Life-threatening” means that the subject was at immediate risk of death from the event as it 
oc
curred.  This does not include an event that might have led to death, had it occurred with 
greater severity. 
Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_98176].  If a complication prolongs 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], it is an SAE. 
“Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” does not imply that the subject must have had an overnight stay in the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  If the subject was admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_209747] a day for the purpose of 
treatment or observation, the definition of “Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” is met.  Brief treatment in 
an outpatient clinic or Emergency department does not constitute “inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].” 
The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event (see 
Section 12.1.2); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance (such 
as severe headache).  This is not the same as “serious,” which is based on event outcome or

-PD302 (Amendment 4) Page [ADDRESS_851539]’s life or functioning.  
Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations. 
An SAE is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the Investigator’s Brochure or is not 
listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed. It is the responsibility of the Sponsor 
to make this determination. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Clarification of Subject Deaths 
All subject deaths (re
gardless of relationship to study drug) should be reported within [ADDRESS_851540] death should 
include an AE term for the cause of the death unless the protocol provides other specific 
instructions (e.g., mortality related to underlying disease is an efficacy endpoint).  For all reports 
in which an AE term is not provided (other than “Death”), follow-up for the cause of death will 
be required.  Only in the rare occurrence that no verbatim description of an AE can be obtained 
from the investigative site, then “Death – Unknown Cause” will be used as the event term. 
12.2. Relationship to Study Drug 
The relationship or association of the AE/SAE
 to study drug will be characterized as “ related ” 
or “not related ”.  An AE/SAE will be considered to be not related  to the use of the study drug 
if any of the following criteria are met: 
 An unreasonable temporal relationship between administration of the product and the 
onset on the AE (e.g., the event occurred either before, or too long after administration of 
the product for it to be considered product-related); 
 A causal relationship between the product and the AE is biologically implausible  
(e.g., death as a passenger in an automobile accident); 
 A clearly more likely alternative explanation for the AE is present (e.g., typi[INVESTIGATOR_316741] a concomitant drug). 
Adverse events will be considered “ related ” to the
 use of the study drug if none of the  
“not related ” criteria are met. 
The Investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship of the AE/SAE to study 
drug.  An AE/SAE may be related to the study drug, other concomitant medications, intercurrent 
illness, a procedure performed in the course of the study, or another reason.  Among the potential 
etiologies, the investigator should make a determination based on the most likely causal 
relationship.  Alternative causes, such as the natural history of any underlying diseases, 
concomitant therapy, other risk factors, and the temporal relationship of the event to the study 
drug should be considered.  The Investigator will also take into account the 
Investigator’s 
Brochure (or Prescribing Information, if applicable) in the causality assessment.   
There may be situations when an SAE has occurred and the Investigator has minimal information 
to include in the initial report to the Sponsor.  However, it is very important that the Investigator 
always makes an assessment of causality prior to transmission of the SAE report to the Sponsor, 
as the causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting

CONFIDENTIAL and PROPRIETARY  requirements.  The Investigator may change the causality assessment in light of follow-up 
information, by [CONTACT_636934].   
12.3. Recording Adverse Events 
Out of range clinical laboratory findings (e.g., clinical chemistry, hematology) or findings on 
other assessments (e.g., electrocardiogram, X rays, vital signs) per se are not reported as AEs.  
However, if the out of range finding that is deemed clinically significant or is associated with 
signs and/or symptoms must be recorded as an AE (and additionally as an SAE if it meets the 
crite
ria of being serious; see  Section 12.1.4),  as described above. 
The Investigator should exercise medical and scientific judgment in deciding whether an out of 
range clinical laboratory finding or finding on other assessment is clinically significant.  Usually, 
the abnormality should be associated with a clinically evident sign or symptom, or be likely to 
result in an evident sign or symptom in the near term, in order to be considered clinically 
significant.  A clinically significant laboratory abnormality in the absence of clinical symptoms 
may jeopardize the subject and may require intervention to prevent immediate consequences.  
For example, a markedly low serum glucose concentration may not be accompanied by [CONTACT_636935], yet be of a magnitude to require glucose administration to prevent such sequelae. 
12.4. Reporting Adverse Events 
The Sponsor has requirements for reporting SAEs to both the local regulatory authority, other 
regulatory agencies, and Eudravigilance about the safety of a drug unde
r clinical investigation.  
The Sponsor or designee must be notified within 24 hours once the Investigator determines that 
an AE meets the protocol definition of an SAE.  The procedures for reporting serious adverse 
events are as follows: 
 Complete the “Serious Adverse Event Report”; 
 Contact [CONTACT_636936] 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the 
event; 
 For fatal or life-threatening events, also fax copi[INVESTIGATOR_3103], autopsy 
reports, and other documents when requested and applicable. 
The Sponsor or designee may request additional information from the Investigator to ensure the 
timely completion of accurate safety reports. 
Any fatal or life-threatening events should also be reported immediately by [CONTACT_636937]’s designee. 
The Investigator, or responsible person according to local requirements, must comply with the 
applicable local regulatory requirements concerning the reporting of SAEs to all applicable 
reg
ulatory authorities and IRB/REB/IECs. 
12.4.1. Post-Study Reporting Requirements 
All SAEs, regardless of cause or relationship, which occur from the time of study drug 
administration up to and including the safety follow-up visit, must be reported to the Sponsor or 
designee.  If the Investigator learns at any time after a subject has been discharged from the study 
ADS -5102 for Treatment of LID  16 July 2015  
Adamas Pharmaceuticals, Inc.              Protocol ADS-AMT
-PD302 (Amendment 4) Page [ADDRESS_851541] qualified as an SAE during the study, and 
such event is reasonably related to previous study drug exposure, the Investigator should 
promptly notify the Sponsor or designee. 
12.4.2. Investigator Reporting Responsibility 
When an investigative site receives an initial or follow-up notification of an SAE or other safety 
information (e.g., revised Investigator’s Brochure) from the Sponsor, the responsible person, 
according to local requirements, must submit this information to the local IRB/REB/IEC and 
keep a copy in their files. 
12.4.3. Pregnancy 
A pregnancy is not an AE.  If a subject becomes pregnant while enrolled in the study following 
administration of study drug, the Sponsor or designee must be notified within [ADDRESS_851542] will be followed through the outcome of the pregnancy.  The 
Investigator will be required to complete a Pregnancy Information Form and fax the information 
to the Sponsor or designee.

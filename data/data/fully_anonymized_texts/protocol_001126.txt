Objectives  The primary objective is to investigate the feasibility of performing 
this minimally invasive fetal surgical repair of myelomeningocele 
(MMC).  
Number of Subjects  [ADDRESS_940259] common congenital anomaly of the central nervous system that is compatible with life.

1. The most frequent form is myelomeningocele (MMC), characterized by [CONTACT_693395][INVESTIGATOR_693332] a sac filled with cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872] (CSF), and is associated with lower limb paralysis and bowel and bladder dysfunction.

and second trimesters, with diagnosis often occurring between 14 and 20 weeks of gestation following maternal serum screening and detailed fetal 
ultrasound.
(2-5)   
  
3. Fetal MMC is usually associated with an Arno ld-Chiari II malformation, 
which includes a constellation of anomalies such as hindbrain herniation, 
brainstem abnormalities, low -lying venous sinuses and a small posterior 
fossa. (6-7) This malformation is associated with different degrees of 
hydrocephalus. The Arnold- Chiari II malformation has well- known 
deleterious effects on motor, cranial nerve and cognitive functions. (6-7) 
Postnatally some form of CSF -peritoneal shunt is frequently required, 
often resulting in a lifelong requirement for monitoring due to the frequent complications such as shunt failure, migration and infection. 
(6, 8- 
[ADDRESS_940261] shown that prenatal coverage of a spi[INVESTIGATOR_693333] -like lesion can preserve neurological function and reduce or reverse hindbrain 
herniation.
(9, 11 -14)   These studies suggest a “two -hit” hypothesis in which the ultimate 
neurologic deficit results from a combi nation of the failure of normal neural -tube closure 
(first hit) with secondary spi[INVESTIGATOR_693334] (second hit mechanism).
(15-16)  
  
Our group developed a technique to trea t fetoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_693335] a sheep model

Rodrigo Ruano, MD    CONFIDENTIAL  1.4  Clinical Data to Date  
1.4.1 Unpublished data:   
Using the knowledge and expertise gained with more than [ADDRESS_940262] Michael Belfort (where [CONTACT_693450] was part 
of the group before joining Mayo Clinic), in collaboration with a group in Barcelona (Peiro et 
al (17)), has developed a novel approach for the minimally invasive repair of fetal neural tube 
defects. This technique has now been employed in 7 human cases in Barcelona, Spain, 1 in 
Mexico City, Mexico and 1 in Shira z, Iran showing its feasibility and applicability to the 
human uterus and fetus, and demonstrating an improved degree of flexibility in terms of access to the fetus regardless of placental location. The technique is designed to decrease the maternal risks of open fetal surgery while maintaining a similar level of fetal benefit as seen 
in the randomized controlled trial that compared fetal intervention versus postnatal therapy 
for spi[INVESTIGATOR_113163], which was called the MOMS trial.
 (18)  
  
Our technique employs a n open abdomen/closed uterus methodology that allows significantly 
more flexibility in the minimally invasive portion of the fetal neural tube repair while at the same time allowing a closed skin repair in a similar manner to that employed at Mayo Clinic using an open uterus approach. In the 9 human cases performed in Barcelona, Mexico City and Shiraz there has not been any incidence of maternal premature rupture of the membranes 
(PPROM) except for 1 case at 35+ weeks. One pregnancy was delivered at 28 week s 
(Mexico). The [ADDRESS_940263] all been delivered by [CONTACT_693396] 7 were by [CONTACT_693397] (37+ weeks), one was at 35+ weeks because of PPROM, and 1 (in Mexico) was at [ADDRESS_940264] 2 cases, the skin edges were sutured with a V -loc suture showing that this technique is also feasible.  
  
The technique employs  a novel approach to low pressure uterine distention using the same 
carbon dioxide gas 
(14, 19 -22) that others attempting fetoscopic repair have used, but employing 
a much lower gas flow rate and pressure. In addition, our technique allows a significantly 
quicker neural tube repair because of improved access to the fetus, ability to manipulate the 
fetus into the required position, and superior port placement resulting from the exteriorized 
maternal uterus. In addition, because of the exteriorized uterus and the superior placement this allows, we require only two access ports and these can be sutured into the uterus allowing a closed seal and minimizing gas leakage. Finally, recent advances in miniature surgical instruments (Storz 1.5 -  3mm surgical sets) allow unprecedented flexibility which 
enables a full surgical repair to be performed via a fetoscopic approach.  
  
Fetoscopic Repair of Spi[INVESTIGATOR_693329] 9.0 
    Revised 01/28/[ADDRESS_940265] care, the frequency of complications should be appropriately reduced and results 
assessed in larger groups over a longer period of time.  
1.4.2 Published Cl inical Investigations  
  
The recent publication of the NICHD sponsored randomized controlled trial (MOMs Trial  
(18) 
) demonstrated clear neonatal benefit of open in -utero fetal surgical repair of MMC. The 
study showed a reduction in neurological morbidity, especially in terms of decreased severity of hydrocephalus and in degree of hindbrain herniation (relative risk: 0.67; 95% confidence interval: 0.56- 0.81, and need for postnatal ventricular -peritoneal shunting (risk relative: 0.48, 
95% confidence interval: 0.36–0.64).  
  
Open in- utero fetal surgery is not without risk and the MOMS Trial showed an elevation in 
maternal -fetal morbidity/risk when compared to the postnatally treated group, including 
higher risk for chorioamniotic separation (26% vs. 0%, respectively), maternal pulmonary 
edema (6% vs. 0%), oligohydramnios (21% vs. 0%), placental abruption (6% vs. 0%), 
sponta neous membrane rupture (46%; RR: 6.15; 95% CI: 2.75- 13.78), spontaneous labor 
(38%; RR: 2.80, 95% CI: 1.51- 5.18), maternal blood transfusion (9%; RR: 7.18; 95% CI:  
0.90- 57.01), and preterm delivery before 34 weeks (46%; RR: 9.2; 95% CI: 3.81 2.19).
(18)  
The reason for the increased incidence of these complications was related to the nature of the 
open fetal procedure, which involves a multi -faceted invasive approach including maternal 
laparotomy, large hysterotomy with uterine edge stapling, and open fetal  repair of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_693336] a significant amount of time.  
  
Fetal endoscopic surgery has progressed rapi[INVESTIGATOR_693337] a number of intricate procedures inside the uterus with specially designed instruments. These procedures include laser therapy for Twin- twin-transfusion syndrome, 
fetal cystoscopy and fulguration of posterior urethral valves, release of amniotic bands, and 
placement of various shunt s and balloons inside fetal structures and cavities (peritoneal, 
pleural, cardiac, and trachea).  
  
  
    
Fetoscopy offers a less invasive therapeutic option that could reduce a number of the 
morbidities (both maternal and fetal) related to open fetal proc edures. 
(21-25)  A few animal 
studies and some clinical human experience with fetoscopic repair of MMC have been 
reported showing the feasibility of covering the defect with a patch and sealant, or even in 
performing a full repair. These repairs have been accomplished using at least two (and 
sometimes more) entry ports through the uterine wall.(20, [ADDRESS_940266] 
demonstrated the feasibility of performing a complete percutaneous fetoscopic repair of 
MMC using carbon dioxide to distend the  uterus and provide a dry working area for the 
surgeon to perform the repair.(24, 26)  These investigators described a two -layer covering

they showed that the procedur e is feasible; their percutaneous technique with complete two 
layer surgical closure of the defect using sutures was associated with prolonged operative 
time and significant maternal and obstetrical morbidities.  
  
The Kohl group used [ADDRESS_940267] are ongoing at different fetal c enters in the world. There is no question that the 
field is ready for a less invasive methodology than what is currently available with open fetal 
repair.  
  
The value of the Kohl experience has been in proving that CO2 insufflation in the uterus is 
not toxic to either mother or fetus and is well tolerated by [CONTACT_693398]. 
(27)   In their 37 procedures, 36 were successful without maternal or fetal 
complication intra -operatively. In one case acute membrane rupture occur red during the 
surgery -  a not uncommon complication during any fetoscopic procedure regardless of the 
use of CO2. In a second case, maternal bleeding occurred when one of the trocars was removed after the surgery.  
  
A recent publication by [CONTACT_693399] 
(28) showed that in fetal endoscopic repair of spi[INVESTIGATOR_693338] (fSBA), on average, the fSBA group were born at a lower gestational age than the 
neonatally repaired spi[INVESTIGATOR_693339] (nSBA) group (median 32 wks [range 25- 34 wks] vs 39 
wks [34- 41 wks];  p=0.001). The fSBA were all operated on by [CONTACT_693400]’s group in Bonn, 
[LOCATION_013], while the neonatal repair group were operated on in Groeningen in Holland. The fSBA group experienced more complications (chorioamnionitis 3/13 (23%), premature rupture 
of the  amniotic membranes 11/13 (85%), oligohydramnios 8/13(62%), and infant respi[INVESTIGATOR_693340] -pressure ventilation 10/13 (77%).
 (28)  
In their paper regarding fSBA patients Kohl et al. reported a maternal complication rate from 
hemorrhage of 19% (3/16). In two of these cases there was minor placental bleeding during 
the procedure from inadvertent trauma, while in one case one of the troc ars was inadvertently 
placed through an anterior placenta and resulted in heavy placental bleeding. It should be remembered that Kohl et al have employed a technique that utilizes a minimum of 3 trocars 
and frequently more, and a procedure time of a median of 4 hours (range 5 minutes to 8 
hours). Compared to open spi[INVESTIGATOR_693341]: chorioamnionitis – 23% vs. 3%, PPROM 85% vs. 46%, oligohydramnios – 62% vs. 21%, In terms of neurological function however, Verbeek et al 
(28) noted better preservation

preserved knee -jerk [p=0.006] and anal [p=0.032] reflexes). (28)  
  
The intra -individual difference in leg muscle ultrasound dens ity was smaller in fSBA than in 
nSBA infants (mean difference 24, 95% confidence interval [CI] 15- 33; p<0.05), which was 
associated with better preserved segmental muscle function. Verbeek et al (28) concluded that 
fetal endoscopic surgery is associated wi th spi[INVESTIGATOR_693342], but that it 
results in more complications.  
  
To date, I was part of some surgeries performed at [LOCATION_007] Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/Baylor College 
of Medicine. We have performed one initial case that was published in the Obstetr ics and 
Gynecology journal. (29)  This case was performed under a Baylor College of Medicine IRB 
approved protocol investigating the surgical approach prior to becoming aware that an IDE was required. AC is a [ADDRESS_940268] open procedure and consented to the open procedure. She was 
then (per protocol) apprised of the fetoscopic procedure and she fully understood the 
procedure and the risks and benefits. She underwent the surgery on 7/30/[ADDRESS_940269] was closed as expected. There were no complications with the surgery or postoperative course and the patient was discharged to an outpatient facility (Ronald McDonald House) 
where she remained until 09/03/2014. On t hat date, at 28 -2/7 weeks she presented with 
ruptured membranes and was hospi[INVESTIGATOR_693343] (ampi[INVESTIGATOR_693344]). She remained in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_693345] (breech 
presentation) on 9/21/2014 at 30- 6/7 weeks because of a fetal tachycardia and non -specific 
concern for fetal wellbeing. The baby (GC) did well and had Apgar scores of [ADDRESS_940270] published his experience considering technique, maternal 
outcomes and postnatal outcomes. 
(30-32) The [LOCATION_013] group have demonstrated that 
fetoscopic repair of spi[INVESTIGATOR_693346] (no cases of maternal demi se, 
spontaneous labor, placental abruption or need for transfusion) with similar postnatal 
outcomes [Ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement within 1 year was required in 45% of the 
cases] when compared to the MOMs trial. However, the [LOCATION_013] group has descri bed high 
rates of premature rupture of the membranes (PPROM) [84.3%, mean gestational age at 29.7 
(range, 22.6 -37.3) weeks] and prematurity [Mean gestational age at delivery was 33 (range, 
24.6- 38.1) as they perform the fetoscopic procedure using 5 ports a nd bigger instruments 
than our group.

Our group published our experience with 28 patients with 22 patients undergoing fetoscopic 
repair of spi[INVESTIGATOR_113163]. (33)  We demonstrated that improvement of the surgical technique 
allowed for better outcomes, leakag e of cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_693347] 10%, postnatal hydrocephalus 
in 30%, vaginal delivery in 60% and premature rupture of the membranes in 10%. The 
outcomes related to the fetus were very similar to the open fetal repair, but with significant 
reduction of maternal  morbidity.  
1.5  Study Rationale and Risk Analysis (Risks to Benefits Ratio)  
1.5.1 Study Rationale  
  
The novel portions of this surgery will be;  
1) the approach to the uterus and the use of a minimally invasive technique with 
CO2 gas within the uterus and 2)  a two -three port approach.   
  
In this procedure, the maternal abdomen will be opened via a laparotomy incision and the 
uterus will be exteriorized with the fetus in -situ. Once the uterus is exteriorized the fetus can 
be manipulated through the wall of the uterus into an ideal position for the surgery, regardless of the placental location. A small volume of amniotic fluid (+/ - 200cc) will be 
withdrawn through an 18G needle (placed under ultrasound guidance) prior to starting the fetoscopic portion of the surgery, and replaced with carbon dioxide gas at a pressure of less than [ADDRESS_940271] FDA approved/cleared 
surgical equipment the neural tube defect will be endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_693348] s uturing techniques.

4. Local wound infection at the trocar and/or laparotomy sites occurs in less than 5% 
of cases and is managed by [CONTACT_693401]/or local drainage.  
  
5. Regional analgesia can be complicated by [CONTACT_693402], failed 
sensory blockage, infection, hematoma, neurologic injury, and drug side -effects 
(pruritus, nausea and vomiting, urinary retention, hypoventilation, seizure, 
hypotension). The inci dence of these complications is very low and no different 
than for other conditions where loco -regional is offered.  
  
6. General anesthesia has known complications including death, brain injury, asphyxia, hypotension and damage to lungs, larynx, pharynx and teeth.  
  
7. Possible side -effects of the drugs commonly used after fetal surgery include: a. 
Magnesium sulfate -  flushing, sweating, muscle weakness, nausea and vomiting, 
lethargy, blurred vision, excess fluid in the lungs necessitating supplemental oxygen; b. indomethacin - intestinal crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], decreased amniotic fluid 
production, and constriction of the fetal ductus arteriosus, nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_050], hypotension.  
  
8. Preterm labor can be induced by [CONTACT_693403]. Prophylactic tocolysis (first line indome thacin, Magnesium sulfate or nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_693349]) will be given at the time of the procedure.  The risk for patients 
going into labor without PPROM or infection is less than 2%.  
  
    
9. Chorioamnionitis - inflammation of the fetal membranes (amnion a nd chorion) 
due to a bacterial infection. Any invasive procedure may lead to intra -uterine 
infection, despi[INVESTIGATOR_693350]. The most frequent cause of chorio- amnionitis is 
PPROM  with ascending infection, and its presence requires immediate delivery.

Therefore, those patients who undergo open fetal surgeries with hysterotomy need special prenatal care and must deliver by 
[CONTACT_693406] a maximum of [ADDRESS_940273] cesarean section deliveries at a maximum of 37 weeks gestation in subsequent pregnancies. In addition, open fetal surgeries with hysterotomy are associ ated with increased risk of premature rupture of the

[IP_ADDRESS] Anticipated Fetal and Neonate Risks  
  
1. Preterm premature rupture of the membranes. In the absence of signs of infection, 
the patients will be managed expectantly with hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], antibiotics and possible tocolysis. If there is evidence of infection then delivery will be expedited.  
  
2. Preterm birth  
  
3. Placental abruption - very rarely occurs during intrauterine surgery.  
  
4. Chorioamniotic separation

Page 14 of 48  
Rodrigo Ruano, MD    CONFIDENTIAL  5. Chorioamnionitis - inflammation of the fetal membranes (amnion and chorion) 
due to a bacterial infection. Any invasive procedure may lead to int ra-uterine 
infection, despi[INVESTIGATOR_693350]. The most frequent cause of chorio- amnionitis is 
PPROM with ascending infection, and its presence requires immediate delivery.  
  
6. Potential sequelae are PPROM, amniotic band syndrome, and umbilical cord 
occlusion with either fetal growth retardation or death.  
  
7. Indomethacin (if prolonged use, higher than 72 hours) can be associated with 
significant narrowing of the ductus arteriosus in late gestation. If narrowing 
occurs, indomethacin will be discontinued. However, indomethacin will be used 
for 48 hours maximum.  
  
8. Oligohydramnios (decreased amount of amniotic fluid)   
  
9. Anesthesia risks for the fetus include fetal bradycardia and fetal demise. In order 
to avoid fetal demise, we will monitor the fetal heart function continuously during the entire fetal surgery by a specialized fetal cardiologist.   
  
10. No response to the surgical treatment, or failure to reverse the hindbrain herniatio n  
  
11. Injury to the fetus from the procedure including organ damage caused by [CONTACT_693407]2 gas   
  
12. Cord tethering (tissue attachments that limit the movement of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_693351]) which may require later surgery intervention  
  
13. The risk for spontaneous intrauterine death after fetoscopy is NOT increased compared to the risk of spontaneous death in cases managed by [CONTACT_693408].  
  
14. Risks of the dural patch include:  
a. Hematoma formation (a collection of blood in the ar ea of the patch)  
b. Rejection of the patch by [CONTACT_58076]’s body (as a foreign material)  
c. Inflammation  
d. Calcification (hardening of the patch)  
e. Delayed bleeding / hemorrhage  
f. Adhesion formation (patch causes tissues to adhere together)  
  
15. Complications arisin g from preterm birth:  
a. Intraventricular hemorrhage (bleeding in the brain)  
b. Retinopathy of prematurity (damage to the infant eyes)

1.5.3 Risk Minimizing Procedures and Activities  
[IP_ADDRESS] Fetus  
The fetal procedures will be performed by [CONTACT_693409]. The 
fetal medicine investigators have extensive experience in fetoscopy. The neurosurgery 
collaborator has s ignificant experience in postnatal and fetal repair of MMC, and is 
experienced in the postnatal care of a baby [CONTACT_693410]. This project will be carried out with 
the help of our fetal intervention, pediatric surgery, neurosurgery and neurology colleagues.  
  
[IP_ADDRESS] Maternal  
Maternal infectious complications: prophylactic administration of intravenous antibiotics. 
Complications and side -effects of epi[INVESTIGATOR_44187] (if applied): the procedure will be 
carried out or under the direct supervision of an expert i n this procedure. Preterm labor 
induced by [CONTACT_25234]: prophylactic administration of tocolytics. Maternal 
uterine/placental bleeding: ultrasound guidance of trocar insertion, placement of sutures 
around trocar ports and direct vision and ability to suture bleeding ports because of the 
exposed uterus.  
  
[IP_ADDRESS] Confidentiality  
We will take all precautions to minimize this risk. Once the consent form is signed subjects 
will be assigned a study ID # and will be identified by [CONTACT_168084] # throughout the s tudy. All 
data collected will be coded with this study ID # and will be stored on a secure server at Mayo Clinic and will be password protected. Only the Principal Investigator, Co-  
Investigators, and designated research staff will have access to the link between the study ID 
and subject identifying information. Any hard copy/paper documentation will be stored in a 
secured area only accessible by [CONTACT_174582].  
    
1.5.4 Risk/Benefit Analysis  
  
Since we are testing the feasibility of the procedure, there is no current data regarding 
procedure failure. This information will be evaluated. If the procedure is not possible to be 
performed, an open fetal surgical repair will be performed immediately f ollowing the 
confirmation of the investigational procedure failure using the same maternal -fetal 
anesthesia. It should be noted that these risks all occur with the current standard open 
procedure as well.  
  
Even with the inherent risks of surgery, the ant icipated benefits of significantly increasing 
neonatal outcomes and decreasing neonatal and maternal morbidity, outweigh the risks. The 
Fetoscopic Repair of Spi[INVESTIGATOR_693329] 9.0 
    Revised 01/28/[ADDRESS_940274] as a result of participating in this research study 
could be:  
  
1. The abil ity to intervene in neural tube defect repair at an earlier gestational age.  
  2. Decreased neonatal morbidity as a result of reduction of the deleterious intrauterine 
effects of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_693352], thus preserving functional ability.  
  
3. Direct improvement of neonatal outcomes by [CONTACT_693411].  
  
4. Direct reduction of mat ernal morbidity because of shorter hospi[INVESTIGATOR_693353].  
  5. Decreased future morbidity for mothers by [CONTACT_693412]. A potential benefit to society is the development of 
minimally invasive techniques and equipment that has the potential to change the face of 
fetal therapy for indications other than open neural tube defec ts.  
1.[ADDRESS_940275] udy shows that the 
technique is feasible, then the next step will be to perform a randomized controlled study comparing the efficacy of the technique and open fetal surgical repair of MMC.

A hysterotomy increases the risk of uterine rupture and require s that all subsequent deliveries 
are by [CONTACT_49812] (increasing her risk in all future pregnancies). There is also a 
decreased risk of PPROM and prematurity. Finally, a vaginal delivery is possible following

Patients will be offered the minimally invasive technique as an option to the open fetal 
surgical repair of MM C (considered the gold standard). All patients will be closely followed 
up after the procedure, with weekly ultrasound examinations and consultations.  Delivery will be scheduled at the participating center hospi[INVESTIGATOR_693354] -up for 
24 months by [CONTACT_37152].  
    
3.2  Primary Study Endpoints  
The primary outcome measure will be to evaluate maternal, obstetrical and perinatal 
outcomes after fetoscopic repair of spi[INVESTIGATOR_693355] a larger study.    
  
To assess and descri be the following neonatal outcomes following MMC fetoscopic repair:  
• Rate of persistence of CSF leakage from the repaired wound or delayed 
pseudomeningocele formation  
• Rate of need for shunt placement in the first year of life

• Gestational age at delivery  
• Long term neurological outcome until 60 months  
• Hindbrain herniation  
  
To assess and describe the following maternal outcomes following minimally invasive 
procedure:  
• Short term morbidity including pr eterm labor, preterm premature rupture of 
membranes, placental abruption, and abdominal or vaginal bleeding  
• Peri-operative complications such as anesthesia complications, edema, wound 
infection  
• Incidence of maternal and obstetrical complications such as oligohydramnios, preterm 
premature rupture of the membranes, prematurity (<37 weeks), extreme preterm birth 
(<32 weeks) and comparison to historical controls and our own open fetal surgery cases  
  
3.3  Secondary Study Endpoints  
Secondary endpoints are related to postnatal outcomes including:  
• Successful closure of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_693357] (defined as whether the minimally 
invasive technique can be technically performed in human patients (success of 
primary skin closure) by [CONTACT_693414] 24 hours after birth).  
• Frequency of reversal of Chiari malformation  
• Presence of clinical hydrocephalus that needs postnatal treatment including 
ventriculo- peritoneal shunting or endoscopic thir d ventriculostomy evaluated until the 
age of 5 years.  
• Neurological function evaluated by [CONTACT_693415].  
• In addition the procedure will be assessed as to whether it prevents loss of functional 
neurol ogical level during intra -uterine life by [CONTACT_693416].

• An investigat or may ask a subject who is withdrawing whether the subject wishes to 
provide continued follow -up and further data collection subsequent to their 
withdrawal from the interventional portion of the study. Under this circumstance, the 
discussion with the subj ect would distinguish between study- related interventions and 
continued follow -up of associated clinical outcome information, such as medical 
course or laboratory results obtained through non- invasive chart review, and address 
the maintenance of privacy an d confidentiality of the subject’s information  
• If a subject withdraws from the interventional portion of the study, but agrees to 
continued follow -up of associated clinical outcome information as described in the 
previous bullet, the investigator must obtain the subject’s informed consent for this 
limited participation in the study (assuming such a situation was not described in the 
original informed consent form). In accordance with FDA regulations, IRB approval 
of informed consent documents would be required (21 CFR 50.25, 56.109(b), 312.60, 
312.66, 812.100)  
• If a subject withdraws from the interventional portion of a study and does not consent 
to continued follow -up of associated clinical outcome information, the investigator 
must not access for purposes related to the study the subject’s medical reco rd or other

as standard of care:  
  
• Demographics/Medical History  
• Maternal obstetrical history  
• Physical Exam including Vital Signs  
• Height & Weight  
• Laboratory tests –karyotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007]  
• HIV & Hepatitis B & C testing if not done clinically already.  
• Prior/concomitant medications  
• Comprehensive obstetrical ultrasound examination, including documentation of 
cervical length, gestational age, biometry, confirmation of Arnold- Chiari II 
Fetoscopic Repair of Spi[INVESTIGATOR_693329] 9.0 
    Revised 01/28/[ADDRESS_940285], and determination of the anatomic spi[INVESTIGATOR_693358] w ell as the functional lesion level  
• Maternal/Fetal MRI to confirm the diagnosis of MMC, spi[INVESTIGATOR_693359] -Chiari II malformation  
• Fetal Echocardiogram to rule out structural abnormalities;  
• Patient Education including: MM C description, prenatal and neonatal development, 
general expected outcomes and management options  
• Clearance for surgery by [CONTACT_693424]  
• Psychosocial evaluation to identify family support and possible confounding social issues  
• MMC counseling (including information regarding prenatal and postnatal surgery, 
management following prenatal surgery  
  
The standard management options of postnatal repair and open fetal surgical repair will be 
offered to all patients as the first set of th erapeutic options and the gold standard. In addition, 
our group will offer the procedure as an alternative experimental option, with a full 
explanation of the experimental nature of the procedure, the technical benefits and difficulties, and the risks and potential benefits of the procedure and the limited long term outcomes information.  
  
Those patients who request participation in the present study will be informed that they can, a 
priori, select a cross -over arm if for any reason the fetoscopic procedur e is not possible. They 
can elect that an open fetal surgical repair of MMC be performed (if MOMs criteria are met) or postnatal intervention. This would allow her to have a significantly less morbid procedure on the uterus than open hysterotomy. In the event that this is not possible an open uterus procedure can be performed. In addition, a standardized packet of information will be provided. This packet contains materials describing MMC and includes materials describing 
prenatal and neonatal development, general outcomes expected, and management options in 
pregnancy and the newborn period.  
6.2  Visit 2 – Fetoscopic Procedure to Repair MMC  
The procedure will be performed between 19 0/7 and 25 6/7 weeks at the Mayo Clinic, 
Jacobson Building, [COMPANY_002]ster, Minnesota.  
  
Maternal -Fetal anesthesia:  
This procedure will be performed under general anesthesia with placement of a maternal 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_693360]. This is the same anesthesia approach 
currently in use for open fetal surgeri es. The rationale for using the same anesthetic technique 
for this minimally invasive procedure and for open fetal surgical repair of MMC is to allow 
moving to open fetal surgery in those cases where the fetoscopic procedure cannot be 
performed. This will also provide adequate fetal anesthesia during the procedure.  
  
Prophylactic Tocolysis and antibiotics:  
Prophylactic tocolysis will be used in all patients with a protocol employing indomethacin 
25mg Q6 for 24 hours and nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_050] 10 mg Q6 for 24 hours. I f regular, significant, uterine

gram IV loading dose followed by a 2 gram/hour continuous infusion. Prophylactic antibiotics will also be used during the procedure using Cephalexin 1 g IV immediately 
before the procedure. Nafcillin will be injected into the amniotic cavity at the conclusion of 
the procedure. Steroids for lung maturity: steroids for fetal lung maturation will be given 
between 24 and 25 6/7 weeks (two doses of [ADDRESS_940286] dose given 48- 72 hours before the procedure.  
  
Minimally invasive procedure:  
We will use a standard laparotomy approach that we currently use in our open fetal surgeries. 
This involves a transverse lower abdominal skin incision and exposure of the rectus sheath 
with entry into the abdomen through a vertical or horizontal fascial incision. Once the 
maternal belly is opened the uterus is exposed and ultrasound is performed to determine the 
position of the fetus. If necessary, the uterus will be exteriorized and the fetus will be gently 
repositioned using external version techniques under ultrasound guidance in order to have the 
fetal back facing upwards (when the mother is supi[INVESTIGATOR_050]). A small volume of amniotic fluid (+/ - 
200cc) will be withdrawn through an 18G needle (placed under ultrasound guidance) prior to starting the fetoscopic por tion of the surgery, and the amniotic fluid will be replaced with 
carbon dioxide gas at a pressure of less than 20 mmHg. A 9- 12 Fr (Cook Medical, Inc., 
Indiana, [LOCATION_003]) or Step™ Short 5 mm (Covidien, [LOCATION_005], [LOCATION_003]) cannula will be introduced into the amniotic cavity by [CONTACT_693425], and sutured in place with a through and through vicryl stitch that will plicate the fetal membranes and prevent extension of membrane separation.  
The pediatric cystoscope (Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, [LOCATION_013] or Richard Wolf Medical  
Instruments Corp, Illinois, [LOCATION_003]) will be placed into the uterus via this port. An additional 
610F port will be added under vision and sutured in place as described. The Storz instruments (graspers, scissors, and needle drivers) will be used via these ports to perform the surgery. If necessary additional amniotic fluid will be removed under direct vision and replaced by [CONTACT_693426] (< 20mmHg). The maximum insufflation pressures used by 
[CONTACT_693427] 9 mmHg to 25 mmHg with a median of 17 mmHg). The fetus will be 
“floating” in the amniotic fluid with the spi[INVESTIGATOR_693361]. A 
humidifier (In suflow, Lexion Medical LLC, St. Paul, Minnesota, [LOCATION_003]) will be used during 
the fetoscopic procedure in order to maintain the chorion- amniotic membranes intact and 
wet. Because of the unique circumstances of the laparotomy and exteriorized uterus, the 
access  ports can be placed distant from the placenta in order to minimize the chances of 
abruption of the placenta.  
  
The meningomyelocele sac will be opened at the interface of skin and membranes with the 
micro scissors to free the placode from the membranes c ircumferentially. The placode will be 
allowed to descend into the lesion leaving the skin edge above. A pi[INVESTIGATOR_693362] (Medtronic Durepair regeneration matrix, Medtronic, Oakland, NJ, [LOCATION_003]) will be cut 
to the size of the meningomyelocele  defect, introduced through a port using a grasper and 
laid on top of the placode without any suture. The main reason for placing a pi[INVESTIGATOR_693363] 9.0 
    Revised 01/28/[ADDRESS_940287] surgical technique with barbed 4/0 (Covidien,V -loc or Ethicon Stratfix) suture. If skin 
closure is not possible using the available skin, relaxing incisions will be made using micro 
scissors [ADDRESS_940288] to allow a primary skin closure. If primary skin closure is 
not possible after relaxing incisions are made, the uterus will be opened and the procedure 
completed with a sewn in patch of AlloDerm (Life Cell Corp. Branchburg, NJ)  using an 
open technique.  
  
Before removing the trocar, the gas will be removed through the port and the amniotic fluid 
will be replaced by [CONTACT_693428].  
  
6.3  Weekly postsurgical visits – Postsurgical Management before delivery (V3 follow -ups)  
The expected hospi[INVESTIGATOR_693364] 96 hours; however, it is possible that the patient will be 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_693365]. The patient will then be discharged to nearby 
[CONTACT_693429] (usually Ronald McDonald House in 
[COMPANY_002]ster, Minnesota) Patients will be on modified bed rest for the first [ADDRESS_940289] discharge, but will subsequently be allowed to graduate to moderate activity if the uterus is quiesc ent.  
  
Patients will return on a weekly basis for fetal ultrasound examinations and consultations. 
Targeted ultrasonography will be used to evaluate the functional neurological level (as shown 
by [CONTACT_693430]), the posterior ventricles, the Ar nold- Chiari II malformation, 
amniotic fluid level, & membrane status (weekly). Fetal Surveillance by [CONTACT_693431] 34 weeks In addition a monthly comprehensive ultrasound examination will be performed and an MRI wil l be repeated at 30 -32 weeks of gestation.  
  
    
  
6.4  Delivery (V4)  
If MRI at [ADDRESS_940290], and that there has been reversal 
of the Chiari malformation, the patient will be delivered according to obstetric principles 
which include the option of a vaginal delivery. Cesarean section will  only be performed 
based on obstetrical need. This is a major benefit of the fetoscopic procedure, and has long 
standing implications for the obstetric future of the mother. Not only will she avoid the risk of uterine rupture in the current pregnancy, but she potentially a cesarean section for the delivery of the current baby [CONTACT_693432]. This will lower her risk of hemorrhage and death in the current pregnancy, and will decrease her risk of placenta accreta 
in subsequent pregnancies.

Descriptive Statistics  
  
Fetoscopic Repair of Spi[INVESTIGATOR_693329] 9.0 
    Revised 01/28/2021  
Page 30 of 48  
Rodrigo Ruano, MD    CONFIDENTIAL  Descriptive statistics (e.g., mean standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum for 
numerical data and counts and percents for categorical data) will be calculated, as appropriate 
for all variables. Baseline values for demographic, clinical, and outcome  variables (primary 
and secondary) will be described.  
  
All pregnant women/fetuses entered into the study at Visit 1 will be included in the safety 
analysis. The frequencies of AEs by [CONTACT_24975], body system, severity and relationship to study 
procedures will be summarized. SAEs (if any) will be described in detail.  
AE incidence will be summarized along with the corresponding exact binomial 95% two-  
sided confidence intervals.  
  
Handling of Missing Data  
  
Missing data will be addressed using last observation carry forward (LOCF) where 
appropriate. Where LOCF is not appropriate missing data will be left as missing. Heavy 
tailed distributions and outliers will be addressed by [CONTACT_693437]. Data will be r eviewed for outliers before analysis and 
values may be checked against source data.  
  
Multiplicity  
  
For both the primary analyses, and the secondary analyses, there will be one primary (or first) 
analysis and thus no correction will be made for multiple comparisons. A sequence of 
outcomes of interest will be described for each analyses, and significance will be assessed in the order of these sequences. Therefore, testing involves closed testing procedures that protect the probability of falsely rejecting the null hypothesis. If a test fails to be significant, 
then further tests will be calculated in an ex ploratory rather than inferential manner.  
7.[ADDRESS_940294] Population(s) for Analysis

the investigational procedure.)  
  
• Fewer than one (1) obstetrical SAE ≥ Grade 4 as defined by [CONTACT_693440] “probably” or “definitely” related to the procedure.  (Examples: obstetrical 
Grade 4 event = premature rupture of the membranes, fetal grade 5 event = placental 
abruption)  
 
• Any clinically indicated MRIs obtained in the interim between study required and 
standard of care MRI intervals will be reported as an adverse event to the IDE.  
 
  
All adverse events occurring during the study, including those not meeting the criteria of an 
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (UADE) will be recorded on the appropriate case 
report form.  Records of these events will be maintained and reports submitted to the FDA and IRB according to the regulatory requirements.  Expected clinical adverse events and 
nonsignificant (not serious) clinical adverse events will be reported. Expected clinical 
adverse events and anticipated adverse device effects are those listed in Section 1.5.2.  
8.1  Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_693371]: The trial will be voluntarily placed on hold for the following reasons 
until the FDA, Sponsor -Investigator and the DSMB (see Section 8.7.1) evaluate the safety of 
the trial and address any required changes to the investigational plan to decrease risk and improve safety:  
• if there is one (1) maternal SAE ≥ Grade 4 as defined by [CONTACT_693441], and determined to be  
“probably” or “definitely” related to the procedure  
• if there is one (1) fetal SAE ≥ Grade 4 as defined by [CONTACT_3989] t he investigational 
procedure, and determined to be “probably” or “definitely” related to the procedure.  
• if there is one (1) obstetrical SAE ≥ Grade 4 as defined by [CONTACT_693442], and determined to be “probably” or “definitely” relate d to 
the procedure.  (Examples: obstetrical Grade 4 event = premature rupture of the 
membranes, fetal grade 5 event = placental abruption)  
    
  
8.2  Clinical Adverse Events  
Clinical adverse events (AEs) will be monitored throughout the study.  
8.[ADDRESS_940296] medical occurrence in a pregnant woman and/or /fetus who 
has received an intervention (drug, biologic, or other intervention).  The occurrence does not 
Fetoscopic Repair of Spi[INVESTIGATOR_693329] 9.0 
    Revised 01/28/[ADDRESS_940297] a causal relatio nship with the treatment. An AE can therefore be any 
unfavorable or unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or 
intervention, whether or not consi dered related to the medicinal product or intervention.  
  
All AEs (including serious AEs) will be noted in the study records and on the case report 
form with a full description including the nature, date and time of onset, determination of 
non-serious versus serious, intensity (mild, moderate, severe), duration, causality, and 
outcome of the event.  
8.[ADDRESS_940298] (UADE)  
  
An UADE is any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life -threatening problem or 
death caused by, or associated with a device, if that effect, problem or death was not 
previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the inv estigational plan or 
application (including supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious 
problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects (21 
CFR 812.3(s)).  
8.5  Definition  of a Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
  
A SAE is any adverse drug or intervention experience that results in any of the following 
outcomes:  
• Death as a result of  the Investigational Procedure  
• A life -threatening event (at risk of death at the time of the event),  
• **Requir es inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081],  
• A persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a pregnant woman related to the procedure.  
Important medical events tha t may result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse event when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the pregnant woman/fetus and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
  
**For this study, it is recognized that inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_693372]. Standard obstetrical clinical practice generally requires women to be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_693373], preterm premature rupture of membranes, infection, or any other symptoms related to pregnancy may occur. Therefore, every hospi[INVESTIGATOR_693374] t be considered a Serious Adverse Event (SAE). Each hospi[INVESTIGATOR_693375] a SAE. All pregnancy complications will be collected as Adve rse Events during this research study.  
  
Fetoscopic Repair of Spi[INVESTIGATOR_693329] 9.0 
    Revised 01/28/2021  
Page 33 of 48  
Rodrigo Ruano, MD    CONFIDENTIAL  A distinction should be drawn between serious and severe AEs. A severe AE is a major event 
of its type. A severe AE does not necessarily need to be considered serious. For example, 
nausea which persists for several  hours may be considered severe nausea, but would not be 
an SAE. On the other hand, a stroke that results in only a limited degree of disability may be 
considered a mild stroke, but would be a SAE.  
  
  
8.5.1 Relationship of SAE to study device or other intervention  
  
The relationship of each SAE to the study intervention will be characterized using one of the 
following terms: definitely, probably, possibly, unlikely or unrelated.  
  
Definitely – the event fol lows in a reasonable temporal sequence from the study intervention 
and the event cannot be explained by [CONTACT_423]’s medical condition or other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_693376] – there is temporal relationship between the event and study intervention or the 
relation ship is suggestive and the event is unlikely to be explained by [CONTACT_423]’s medical 
condition or other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_693377] – there is some temporal relationship between the event and the study intervention 
and the event is less likely to be explained by [CONTACT_423]’s medical condition or other 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_693378] – there may or may not be some temporal relationship between the event and the 
study intervention and the event is more likely to be explained by [CONTACT_423]’s medical condition or other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_693379] – the event is due to an underlying or concurrent illness or effect of a concomitant 
therapy and is not related to study intervention (e.g., there is no temporal relationship to the study intervention, or has a much more likely alternative etiology)   
  
    
  
8.5.2 Severity of Adverse Events  
  
The sponsor -investigator will use the following NCI CTCAE v5 definitions to grade the 
severity of each AE:  
  
Grade 1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated.  
Grade 2 Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age 
appropriate instrumental ADL*.  
Fetoscopic Repair of Spi[INVESTIGATOR_693329] 9.0 
    Revised 01/28/2021

Rodrigo Ruano, MD    CONFIDENTIAL  Grade 3 Severe or medically sig nificant but not immediately life -threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12342]; disabling; limiting self -care ADL**.  
Grade 4 Life -threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated. Grade 
5 Death related to AE.  
  
Activit ies of Daily Living (ADL)  
*Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the 
telephone, managing money, etc.  
**Self -care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, 
taking medicatio ns, and not bedridden.  
  
8.5.[ADDRESS_940299] review, self -report, physician 
evaluation, non- directive questioning during study visits, and/or clinical or research tests. 
See Section 1.5.[ADDRESS_940300]. Expectedness of the adverse event 
will be based on the Sponsor -Investigator’s determination and study documents (i.e. study 
protocol, informed consent, or IDE Application). All AEs (serious and non -serious) will be 
noted in the study records and recorded on the Adverse Event case report form with a full 
description including the nature, date and time of onset, determination of non- serious versus 
serious, intensity/grade, duration, causality, relationship to the investiga tional product, and 
outcome of the event. Once an adverse event is detected, it will be followed to the extent 
possible until its resolution or until it is judged to be permanent. Any increase in severity of 
an adverse event will be captured as a new event .  
  
SAEs will be documented as specified above and the relationship of each SAE to the study 
intervention will be characterized as outlined in Section 8.5.  The SAEs and UADEs will be 
closely followed and any changes in severity (improving or deteriorating) will be documented until resolved.    
At each contact [CONTACT_1155], the investigator must seek information on adverse events by 
[CONTACT_5147], as appropriate, by [CONTACT_5148].  Study subjects will be routinely 
questioned about adverse effe cts at study visits. Information on all adverse events should be 
recorded immediately in the source document, and also in the appropriate adverse event case 
report form (CRF).  All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic, laboratory 
or pro cedure results should recorded in the source document.  
  
All adverse events occurring during the study period must be recorded.  All observed or 
volunteered adverse effects (serious or non- serious) and abnormal test findings, regardless of 
the treatment group if applicable or suspected causal relationship to the  investigational device 
Fetoscopic Repair of Spi[INVESTIGATOR_693329] 9.0 
    Revised 01/28/[ADDRESS_940301](s) will be recorded in the 
subjects’ case history.  For all adverse effects sufficient information will be pursued and or obtained as to permit; an adequate determination of the outcome, an assessment of the casual 
relationship between the adverse effect and the investigational device or, if applicable other 
study treatment or diagnostic product.  The clinical course of each event should be followed 
until resolution, stabil ization, or until it has been ultimately determined that the study 
treatment or participation is not the probable cause.  Serious adverse events that are still 
ongoing at the end of the study period must be followed up, to determine the final outcome.  
Any serious adverse event that occurs after the study period and is considered to be at least 
possibly related to the study treatment or study participation should be recorded and reported 
immediately.  
  
Causality and severity assessment  
The sponsor -investi gator will promptly review documented adverse effects and abnormal test 
findings to determine 1) if the abnormal test finding should be classified as an adverse effect; 
2) if there is a reasonable possibility that the adverse effect was caused by [CONTACT_693443]; and 3) if the adverse effect meets the criteria for a serious adverse effect.  
  
If the sponsor -investigator’s final determination of causality is “unknown and of questionable 
relationship to the investigational  device or other study treatments,” the adverse effect will be 
classified as associated with the use of the investigational device or other study treatments for reporting purposes.  If the sponsor -investigator’s final determination of causality is 
“unknown but not related to the investigational device or other study treatments,” this 
determination and the rationale for the determination will be documented in the respective 
subject’s case history.  
  
8.6  Adverse Event Reporting  
Unanticipated problems relat ed to the research involving risks to subjects or others that occur 
during the course of this study (including SAEs) will be reported to the IRB in accordance 
with IRB Policies and Procedures for Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or 
Others . AEs that are not serious but that are notable and could involve risks to subjects will 
be summarized in narrative or other format and submitted to the IRB at the time of 
continuing review.  
    
8.6.1 Adverse Event Reporting Period  
  
Detailed information  concerning adverse events (AEs) will be collected and evaluated 
throughout the trial. An AE is any event that is serious, deemed related to the study and/or 
unexpected in nature, severity, or frequency, or fits IRB definition of adverse event. 
Reporting of these events will be as follows:  
  
Fetoscopic Repair of Spi[INVESTIGATOR_693329] 9.0 
    Revised 01/28/2021  
Page 36 of 48  
Rodrigo Ruano, MD    CONFIDENTIAL  For any maternal, fetal or neonatal deaths or other life -threatening events associated with the 
study intervention:  
• Promptly complete an Adverse Event Report  
  
Besides maternal, fetal and neonatal deaths, the following are examples of adverse events to 
be reported.  
  
Maternal events: Stroke, drug allergy, uterine rupture, pulmonary embolus, ascites, spi[INVESTIGATOR_693380], amniotic fluid embolism, hemorrhage that requires blood 
transfusion or laparotomy, chorioamnionitis, pulmonary edema requiring diuretics or 
intubati on, complications of general anesthesia, magnesium toxicity, chorioamniotic 
separation, bleeding from the placenta as a result of study intervention and anhydramnios.  
  
8.6.[ADDRESS_940302] of potential maternal and fetal complications to the intervention. 
The Investigator will promptly notify th e IRB of all Unanticipated, Serious Adverse Events 
that are related to the research activity. Other unanticipated problems related to the research involving risk to pregnant women/fetus/children or others will also be reported promptly.  
  
When an adverse event has been identified, the study team will take appropriated action 
necessary to protect the study participant and then complete the Study Adverse Event 
Worksheet and log.  The sponsor -investigator will evaluate the event and determine the 
necessary fo llow-up and reporting required.  
  
The sponsor -investigator will promptly review documented Unanticipated Adverse Device 
Effects and as necessary shall report the results of such evaluation to FDA within [ADDRESS_940303] as requested.  
  
8.6.3 Sponsor -Investigator Reporting: Notifying the FDA  
  
The sponsor -investigator will report to the FDA all u nanticipated adverse device effects 
according to the required reporting timelines, formats and regulations.  
  
The sponsor -investigator will submit a completed report to the FDA’s Center for Devices and 
Radiological Health for any observed or reported adve rse effect that is determined to be an 
Fetoscopic Repair of Spi[INVESTIGATOR_693329] 9.0 
    Revised 01/28/[ADDRESS_940304].  
  
If the results of the sponsor -investigator’s follow -up evaluation shows that an adverse effect 
that was initially determined to not constitute an un anticipated adverse device effect does, in 
fact, meet the requirements for reporting; the sponsor -investigator will submit a report as 
soon as possible, but in no event later than [ADDRESS_940305] in light of any pre vious, similar report(s).  
  
Subsequent to the initial submission of a report, the sponsor -investigator will submit 
additional information concerning the reported adverse effect as requested by [CONTACT_1622].  
  
Reporting Process

8.6.4 Deviations from the investigational plan.  
The sponsor -investigator shall notify Mayo IRB (see 21 CFR 56.108(a) (3) and (4)) of any 
deviation from the investigational plan to protect the life or physical well -being of a subject 
in an emergency. Such notice shall be given as soon as possible, but in no event later than [ADDRESS_940307] the scientific sou ndness of the plan or the rights, safety, or 
welfare of human subjects, FDA and IRB notification in accordance with 21 CFR 812.35(a) 
also is required.  
    
8.6.5 Follow -up Reports  
  
If a SAE has not resolved at the time of the initial report and new information arises that 
changes the investigator’s assessment of the event, a follow -up report including all relevant 
new or reassessed information (e.g., concomitant medication, medical history) will be 
Fetoscopic Repair of Spi[INVESTIGATOR_693329] 9.0 
    Revised 01/28/[ADDRESS_940308] to report, to the investigator, 
any subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the subject’s personal physici an, believes might 
reasonably be related to participation in this study.   
  
8.6.6 General Physical Examination Findings  
At screening, any clinically significant abnormality should be recorded as a preexisting 
condition.  At the end of the study, any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities that 
meet the definition of an adverse event must also be recorded and documented as an adverse 
event.   
8.7  Medical Monitoring  
It is the responsibility of the sponsor -investigator to oversee the safety of the  study.  This 
safety monitoring will include careful assessment and appropriate reporting of adverse events as noted above, as well as the construction and implementation of a site data and 
safetymonitoring plan (see Section 10 Auditing, Monitoring and Ins pecting).  Medical 
monitoring will include a regular assessment of the number and type of serious adverse 
events.

of the DSMB may be convened more often, as necessary, to address urgent concerns 
regarding patient safety and data integrity.   
  
Studies identified by [CONTACT_693445] e intensive monitoring may be reviewed on a quarterly, 
rather than semiannual basis. Special sessions of the DSMB may be held to address protocol specific issues, as necessary if the events of that protocol require review prior to the next 
scheduled DSMB m eeting. Such meetings may occur through an electronic format.   
  
Meeting Agenda and Format   
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_10718] [ADDRESS_940310] DSMB review and, if 
available, an interim analysis.

Rodrigo Ruano, MD    CONFIDENTIAL  • Each study is assigned two primary reviewers for review, presentation during the 
DSMB meeting a nd making a recommendation. The primary reviewers may ask the 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_693384].   
• If a Committee member is either a principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_5768] -principal investigator, 
statistician or other study tea m member for a study under review, or has any other 
conflict of interest (including substantial financial interest in the study sponsor), that 
member may be present to answer questions regarding the study, but must abstain 
from voting and leave the room pr ior to final deliberations and voting on that study. If 
the Chair is the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_25810], another member of the Committee 
oversees the Committee deliberations and voting.   
  
The meeting format may include both a Closed Session and an Open Session as required by 
[CONTACT_241300].   
  
  
Open Session:  
The DSMB may request the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or study team to attend to provided 
clarification or respond to issues. The open session will focus on the conduct and progress of 
the study and review the safety and efficacy data.   
  
Closed Session:    
Only DSMB members should be present at the closed session. In this session the DSMB will 
review the data and evaluate the study:   
• conduct ( accrual),   
• safety (adverse events) and   
• data integrity (eligibility and protocol deviations)   
• the risk benefit ratio for trial subjects   
  
Meeting Materials   
DSMB interim report templates will be prepared by [CONTACT_693446], for 
review at the DSMB meeting. Interim data rep orts that summarize the safety data and 
describe the status of the study generally consist of two parts:   
  
Part 1 – Open Session Report   
1. Accrual summary that describes subjects screened, enrolled, completed or withdrawn.   
2. A listing of adverse events and serious adverse events blinded to treatment group.   
3. A copy of the annual Mayo IRB continuing review   
  
Part 2 – Closed Session Report   
This confidential report is generally the same as the open session report but unblinded to 
treatment group. This report may also include data on study outcomes including safety data.

Rodrigo Ruano, MD    CONFIDENTIAL  Meeting Outcomes   
In the closed session the DSMB will vote to take one of the following actions for each 
protocol reviewed and present their recommendation to the Principal Investigator:   
1.Full Approval: enrollment may continue; no outstanding questions regarding adverse 
events or study progress.   
2.Conditional Approval: enrollment may continue with the requirement for 
submission by [CONTACT_458] [CONTACT_4007] a satisfactory response to DSMB 
concerns. If the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_693385] a satisfactory response within 14 days or receives an additional extension beyond this time period, enrollment in the 
study will be suspended.   
3.Suspension: enrollment immediately suspended pending principal investigator 
[INVESTIGATOR_693386].   
4.Closure: study closed due to unacceptable adverse event occurrence rate or other 
study issues as deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_4318].   
5.The occurrence of events that prompt the activation of the protocol specific early 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_693387], phase II, and phase III studies require prompt review by [CONTACT_10748] t eam. The study team formulates an appropriate plan of action to ensure patient 
safety (as required by [CONTACT_1622] & IRB). This may include protocol changes and may also require immediate suspension of accrual, as deemed necessary to ensure patient 
safety.   
  
The study team then forwards the action plan to the DSMB chair for review. A copy of the 
action plan is also provided to the DOS DMSB for review at the time it is submitted to the 
FDA & IRB. The DSMB provides a prompt review of the action plan and a summar y of that 
review to the IRB and to the study team. The review by [CONTACT_693447]. The suspended study may only be  re-opened 
after the sponsor -investigator has received FDA approval to do so. It will not be re -opened 
without proper protocol modification.  
  
Minutes   
• All decisions of the DOS DSMB are maintained in the minutes of the committee. The 
decisions of the com mittee are also conveyed in writing to the principal investigator 
[INVESTIGATOR_7966], the study statistician, and the IRB. If the DOS DSMB recommends 
immediate suspension or closure of a study, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_693388].   
o Principal investigators may appeal the decisions of the DOS DSMB by 
[CONTACT_17258] a written appeal to the chair of the DSMB. If the decision 
regarding the appeal is unsatisfactory to the investigator, a second appeal may 
be made to the Chair o f Surgery Research.   
• Suspension or closure of any FDA regulated clinical trial by [CONTACT_693448]. If the suspension is temporary, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_693389] & IRB of the steps taken to remedy the issues that led to the 
suspension.   
Fetoscopic Repair of Spi[INVESTIGATOR_693329] 9.0 
    Revised 01/28/[ADDRESS_940311] of 1996 (HIPAA).  
Those regulations require a signed subject authorization informing the subject  of the 
following:  
• What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study  
• Who will have access to that information and why  
• Who will use or disclose that information  
• The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI.  
  
In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by 
[CONTACT_5151], retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject authorization.  For subjects that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts 
should be made to obtain permission to collect at least vital status (long term survival status 
that the subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled study period.  
9.2  Source Documents  
  
Source data comprise all information, original records of clinical findings, observations, or 
other activities in a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial.  Source  data are contained in source documents.  Examples of these original documents, and  
data records include: hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, 
memoranda, subjects’ diaries or evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, 
recorded data from automated instruments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_24440], microfiches, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic 
media, x -rays, subject files, and records kept at the pharmacy, at the  laboratories, and at 
medico -technical departments involved in the clinical trial. When applicable, information 
recorded on the CRF shall match the Source Data recorded on the Source Documents.  
  
9.3  Case Report Forms  
  
A Case Report Form (CRF) will be completed for each subject enrolled into the clinical 
study.  The investigator -sponsor will review, approve and sign/date each completed CRF; the 
investigator -sponsor’s signature [CONTACT_57322] -sponsor’s 
responsibility for ensur ing that all clinical and laboratory data entered on the CRF are 
complete, accurate and authentic.  
  
The study case report form (CRF) is the primary data collection instrument for the study.  All 
data requested on the CRF must be recorded.  All missing da ta must be explained.  If a space 
on the CRF is left blank because the procedure was not done or the question was not asked,

should be printed legibly in black ink.  If any entry error has been made, to correct such an error, draw a single straight line through the incorrect entry and enter the correct data above 
it.  All such changes must be initialed and dated.  Do not obliterate, erase, or use “white -out” 
for er rors.  For clarification of illegible or uncertain entries, print the clarification above the 
item, then initial and date it.  If the reason for the correction is not clear or needs additional 
explanation, neatly include the details to justify the correcti on.  
  
  
Data Security and Confidentiality  
  
Data will be entered into a secure password -protected database (REDCap) with access 
limited to the study team as delegated by [CONTACT_079].  Study participants will 
be assigned an individual code at the time of enrollment which will be applie d to all of their 
data, allowing for increased confidentiality during data analysis. REDCap allows participant data to be downloaded in a de -identified manner and also includes and audit trail for all data 
entry and subsequent changes to data.  
  
9.[ADDRESS_940312] case histories and regulatory documents.  
  
The sponsor -investigator will retain the specified records and reports during the study and for 
the longer of the following;  
1. As outlined in the Mayo Clinic Research Policy Manual –“Retention of and Access to Research Data Policy” http://may ocontent.mayo.edu/research- policy/MSS_669717,

10 Study Monitoring, Auditing, and Inspecting  
10.1 Study Monitoring Plan  
  
The investigator will allocate adequate time for such monitoring activities.  The Investigator 
will also ensure that the monitor or other compliance or quality assurance reviewer is given access to all the study -related documents and study related faciliti es (e.g. pharmacy, 
diagnostic laboratory, etc.), and has adequate space to conduct the monitoring visit.  
Fetoscopic Repair of Spi[INVESTIGATOR_693329] 9.0 
    Revised 01/28/[ADDRESS_940313] (DSMB) which meets quarterly.  
This study will be monitored on a routine basis during the conduct of the trial.  The Mayo 
Clinic Office of Research Regulatory Support will provide assistance and guidance with 
clinical trial monitoring activities as a service for the sponsor -investigator.  Clinical trial 
monitoring requires review of the study data generated throughout the duration of the study to ensure the validity and integrity of the data along with the protection of human research 
subjects.  This will assist sponsor -investigators in com plying with Food and Drug 
Administration regulations.  
10.2 Auditing and Inspecting  
The sponsor -investigator will permit study -related monitoring, audits, and inspections by [CONTACT_5040], the monitor, and government regulatory agencies, of all study related documents (e.g., 
source documents, regulatory documents, data collection instruments, study data etc.).  The 
sponsor -investigator will ensure the capability for inspections of applicable study- related 
facilities (e.g., pharmacy, diagnostic laboratory, etc.).  
  
Participation as a sponsor -investigator in this study implies acceptance of potential inspection 
by [CONTACT_5152].  
[ADDRESS_940314] (IRB), in agreement with local legal prescriptions, for formal approval of the study.  The decision of the IRB concerning the conduct of the study will be 
made in writing to the sponsor -investigator before commencement of this study.  
  
All subjects for this study will be provided a consent form describing this study and 
providing sufficient information for subjects to make an informed decision about their 
participation in this study.  This consent form will be submitted with the protocol for review 
and approval by [CONTACT_14884].  The formal consent of a subject, using the Approved IRB consent form, must be obtained before that subject undergoes any study procedure.  The consent form must be signed and dated by [CONTACT_29159]’s legally authorized representative, and the individual obtaining the informed consent.

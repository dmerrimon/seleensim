Objectives:  To determine if early treatment with convalescent plasma (CP) therapy reduces 30 -
day mortality among Veterans  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_39869] a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) facility with 
non-severe COVID -19. 
Research Design : This is a non-interventional, retrospective data collection study , designed to 
emulate a (hypothetical) target randomized trial using observational data from the VA electronic 
health record (EHR) database.  Eligible patients  will include Veterans  admitted to a VA Medical 
Center with a SARS -CoV-[ADDRESS_1280120]. The outcome is 30 -day all -cause mortality.   
Methodology:   This project will access VA healthcare data in the EHR  on a national basis . Data 
will be identified and captured usin g Computerized Patient Record System ( CPRS ), on VHA 
servers and the Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW) using the VA Informatics and Computing 
Infrastructure (VINCI) servers and non -identifiable data will be captured using the VA REDCap 
system.  This will also i nclude data from the VA Pathology & Laboratory Medicine Service.  
Additional data will be provided from the Mayo Clinic CP Registry  to identify VA patients who 
have received CP . Death and morbidity , including  intensive care unit (ICU)  transition, intubation , 
extubation, and discharge , will be assessed using VHA data. We will fit inverse probability 
weighted pooled logistic models to estimate the observational analogue of the per -protocol 
effect of CP on [ADDRESS_1280121] 
ratios.  
Clinical Implications:  This project will allow a comprehensive assessment  of the impact of 
convalescent plasma on morbidity and mortality  among Veterans with COVID -19. This study 
aims to produce early evidence on the  effectiveness of CP therapy, a promising approach to 
treating COVID -19. This evidence will help clini cians deliver better clinical care to critically -ill 
Veterans. In addition, it will set the stage for further research that informs the use of CP in 
patients with COVID -19.

infected persons who were older, male, and infirm. [ADDRESS_1280123] been tested or treated for known or probable COVID -19 at a Department of 
Veterans Affairs ( VA) facility.4  
2.2 Rationale  
The convalescent plasma (CP)  collected from individuals who have recovered from a viral 
infection contain neutralizing antibodies. Administering CP to individuals who are infected by [CONTACT_911339]. There is some evidence of benefit of CP treatment 
against  respi[INVESTIGATOR_911322], such as severe acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_244089] (SARS),[ADDRESS_1280124] that CP may improve outcomes in  patients wit h COVID -19.8-12 Based on 
preliminary evidence of possible efficacy, this study will identify early signals of efficacy and

2.[ADDRESS_1280126] (EHR) used to care for Veterans provides a unique opportunity 
to assess the morbidity and mortality for Veterans with COVID -19. CP is one of several novel 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_911323]. Veterans being treated  with CP  in VHA are tracked by [CONTACT_808074] & Laboratory Medicine Service  and the  Mayo  Clinic CP R egistry. This study will 
provide the opportu nity to  observationally  assess the impact of CP for all Veterans with COVID -
[ADDRESS_1280127] of CP therapy on  30-day mortality in COVID -19 patients early 
in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2779]. We will emu late a hypothetical  randomized  trial (target trial) using 
observational data from a large  national sample of patients who received care within the   
VA. We will create a VA-based cohort using VA Corporate Data Warehouse ( CDW ) data 
and other V HA healthcare data sources , such as the  VA Pathology & Laboratory 
Medicine Service , combined with Mayo  Clinic  CP Registry data to evaluate the impact of 
CP among Veterans with COVID -[ADDRESS_1280128] is a collaboration between the CSP Epi[INVESTIGATOR_911324] (CSPEC) in [LOCATION_011], MA

5.0 Study Procedures  
5.1 Study  Design  
This study  is an observational study which  emulates a hypothetical randomized trial  (target 
trial)13,14 using observational data from the VHA EHR  database . VA data will be used to emulate 
the eligibility criteria, treatment  strategies, outcome, and follow -up of the target trial .  
Version: 1. 3, 05/25/[ADDRESS_1280132] within 7 days of 
admission, oxygen saturation of ≥90% within the past day, and  non-severe COVID -19. Patients 
previously treated with convalescent plasma or residing  in long -term care in the past [ADDRESS_1280133] SARS -CoV-2–positive test 
date (if the positive test occurred dur ing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) or at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_55110] (if the 
positive  test occurred before hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]).  Eligible patients would be randomly assigned to 
either receive  or not receive CP within [ADDRESS_1280134] access to the VINCI data mart to 
identify Veterans with positive SARS -CoV-2 testing.  
If necessary,  data can be extracted from medical records. In this case, data from VINCI/CDW 
will be reviewed by [CONTACT_911344] a VA REDCap database. Each subject will be 
assigned a unique  study ID and no PHI will be captured within VA REDCap. A crosswalk will be 
used to link the study ID to the Patient ICN. This document will be the only document to link 
study data and will be kept secure within the study’s  VINCI workspace and will only be  
accessible to a limited number of study staff conducting data review.  
5.[ADDRESS_1280135] with study subjects. All subjects 
will be identified from the Mayo Clinic CP Registry , the VA Patholog y & Laboratory Medicine 
Service , and from the VA CDW.

into the study. We are requesting an Exemption  Category  4.iii for secondary research use of 
identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens.  
5.4 Inclusion /Exclusion Criteria  
The population to study will includ e all Veterans who have  tested positive for SARS -CoV-[ADDRESS_1280137] 
Discharge Course. Data review will begin from date of diagnosis, short - and long -term outcomes 
will be assessed up to 1 -year following diagnosis . There are no exclusion criteria for this study.  
5.5 Study  Evaluations  
This is non-interventional, retrospective data study, and therefore we will be using VA CDW 
data within the VA healthcare system.  
5.6 Data Analysis   
Data Collection/Study Measures  
Data will be identified and captured using CPRS, on VHA servers and the C DW u sing the  VINCI 
servers. Data captured will come from several VHA healthcare data sources and National 
Patient Care Databases (NPCDs), including: VA Pathology & Laboratory Medicine Service ,

Outpatient Clinic  and Patient Treatment File (PTF)  datasets, Vital status crosswalk File with 
Real SSNs, Vital Status File with Scrambled SSNs, the Decision Support System (DSS) 
National Data Extract (NDE), Beneficiary Identification Records Locator (BIRLS) death file, 
Pharmacy files, and Pharmacy Benefit  Management (PBM) system database. Data contain 
information on clinic visits, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_911331], diagnosis , and procedure  codes. 
Pharmacy data and laboratory data are available as well . All electronic databases related to the 
study will be stored on double password protected servers behind the VA firewall . Data 
accessed remotely via VINCI or in CDW  will be accessible only by [CONTACT_911345].  
As needed , data from VINCI/CDW will be reviewed by [CONTACT_911344] a VA 
REDCap datab ase. Each Veteran identified will be assigned a unique study ID. A crosswalk 
document will be kept within VINCI that will link the study ID to the Patient ICN. This document 
will be the only document to link study data and will be kept secure within on the  study’s  VINCI  
workspace  and will only be accessible to a limited number of study staff conducting data review. 
The variables below re present  a desirable list of information that will be captured using 
REDCap. We recognize that some of the information will  not be available. Where feasible, we 
will make imputation for some information items.  
Analyses conducted on the study will receive internal quality control checks by [CONTACT_911346].  Below we describe the primary data and 
variables we will use to accomplish the aims of the proposal. The list of data and variables is not 
exhaustive but provides a detailed summary of the types of data will be using . 
Exposure: CP Treatment  
The primary exposure of interest is the use  or the non -use of CP. These data are derived from 
multiple sources, including  the VA Pathology and Laboratory Medicine Service , CDW,  and the 
Mayo Clinic CP Registry . Data on CP recipi[INVESTIGATOR_911332] y and 
Laboratory Medicine Service will be matched  to EHR data  with unique identifiers , which include 
name, date of birth,  VA patient identifiers  (e.g., Patient ICN) , date of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and VA 
medical center  or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Other identifying information to match records may also be available , 
such as Social Security Numbers from the VA Pathology and Laboratory Medicine Service . 
Mayo Clinic data will not include Social Security numbers.  
Outcome variables  
The primary outcome is [ADDRESS_1280138]  
Initial Present ation:  date of encounter, date of birth, sex, race, ethnicity, zip code of residence, 
date symptoms started . 
Prior Medical Diagnoses : chronic obstr uctive pulmonary disease, coronary heart disease, 
cardiac failure, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cerebrovascular disease, chronic liver disease, 
cancer of solid organ, estimated glomerular filtration rate , immunodeficiency , autoimmune 
disorder [RA, IBD,  lupus, etc.]  
Health Limitations and Habits:  smoking (never, former, current).  
Current medications:  diabetes oral medication, diabetes insulin used, immunosuppression 
therapy, blood pressure therapy, angiotensin converting enzyme angiotensin converting enzyme 
Version: 1. 3, 05/25/2021   VA Central IRB Protocol  Page 10 of 13 
 (ACE) inhibitors , angiotensin -receptor blockers (ARBs ), beta blockers, human 
immunodeficiency virus therapy.  
Outpatient Management Course: including symptoms at home, VA physici an management, 
“progression of symptoms” and re -evaluation at the medical center, viral lab testing, and short - 
and long -term outcomes.  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_911333]:  VA Facility, admission date, Initial Admission to (ward, isolation, 
ICU, ICU on ventilator, other), chest x-ray lung findings at admission, PaO2,  admission and 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_911334] ( white blood cell count , lymphocyte count, platelet count, 
hemoglobin, CRP, procalcitonin, serum sodium, serum potassium, serum chloride) , and 
admissi on and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_911335] ( lactate d ehydrogenase  (LDH) , aspartate transaminase  
(AST), alanine aminotransaminase (ALT), bilirubin total, creatine kinase (CK), dDimer), 
influenza vaccine in EHR over past 12 months, assay used to diagnose SARS -CoV-2 infection, 
and co -infection with other respi[INVESTIGATOR_4398].  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_911336]:  ICU (start date and end date) complications (sepsis, acute kidney injury, 
rhabdomyolysis, ARDS, disseminated intravascular coagulation, pneumonia diagnosed by [CONTACT_28839], 
hours to pneumonia  from admission, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23047] (IV antibiotics, IV antifungal, IV antiviral 
(+name [CONTACT_911348]), kidney dialysis, glucocorticoids, extra corporeal membrane oxygenation, IV 
immunoglobulin, IV hyperimmunoglobulin ), other COVID -19 treatments, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345] 
(date) and discharge facility or outcome (residence, nursing facility, death)   
Post Discharge:  COVID -[ADDRESS_1280139] date (if the positive test occurred during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059])  or at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_911337] (if the positive test occurred before hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]).  
Eligible patients would be randomly assigned to either receive or not receive CP. The exact 
timing of transfusion and determination of suitability for use (based on antibody levels or donor 
characteristics of the plasma units) would be left to the discretion of treating physicians. The 
primary outcome would be [ADDRESS_1280140] (the effect of 
assignment to CP on outcomes),  estimate the risk difference and hazard ratio comparing 
patients in the CP and n on-CP group . The risk (cumulative incidence) of outcomes could be 
estimated nonparametrically using the Kaplan -Meier method or under parametric smoothing 
assumptions via a pooled logistic regression model including a time -varying intercept, an 
indicator fo r treatment group, and a product (“interaction”) term between time and treatment 
group. The hazard ratio could be estimated from the pooled logistic regression model without 
the product term. In the case of a prespecified imbalance in baseline characterist ics between 
intervention arms, relevant covariates could be added to the model.  
To estimate the per -protocol effect (the effect of treatment with CP on outcomes  if all patients 
had adhered to the protocol), we would restrict the above intention -to-treat a nalysis to patients 
who adhered to their assigned treatment ( CP or no CP) and adjust for the a priori baseline 
prognostic factors, as well as trial start day relative to first eligibility . The adjustment for these 
covariates would be carried out via invers e probability weighting, with all continuous variables 
Version: 1. 3, 05/25/[ADDRESS_1280141] error, to 
calculate percentile -based confidence intervals (CI) for survival difference and hazard ratio 
estimates.  
Combined analysis with other cohorts in the Mayo  Clinic CP  Registry : Other health systems in 
the registry will be performing similarly data analyses. Research groups are encouraged to 
share the same data analysis plan. Some will contribute summary statistics to a research 
collaboration.  
Sample Size/Power  
We present  power  calculations here for the mortality outcome. It is assumed that approximately 
[ADDRESS_1280142] 500 exposed and 2,500 unexposed subjects assumi ng a 
5:[ADDRESS_1280143] been admitted, making our 
sample viable . Current data shows an approximately 25% mortality rate, among  those admitted 
who either have died or were discharged . Assuming independent observa tions, we would be 
able to detect a hazard ratio of 1.3 with 80% power and 1.35 with 90% power . Given the 
matched design, it is necessary to estimate a design effect due to the matching . A design effect 
of 2.0 would be considered extreme, assuming an intra class correlation of 0.20 and cluster size 
of 6 [5:1] . This would result in an effective sample size of [ADDRESS_1280144] ratio of 1.43 with 80% power and 1.50 with 90% power . These calculations 
assume alpha=0.05.  
5.[ADDRESS_1280145]. We will, however, continue to 
use data previously collected.  
6.0 Reporting  
The Co -Chair s will be jointly  responsible for ensuring that the study adheres to the reporting 
requirements of the VA C entral IRB, local R&D Committee(s), and VA/VHA requirements (e.g., 
VHA Handbook 1200.12 and VHA Handbook 1058.01).  
7.[ADDRESS_1280146] protected servers behind the VA firewall. Once uploaded to networked data servers, 
the data are maintained in a separate network system dedicated to databases containing PHI or 
sensitive data. There are multiple levels of security to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of 
all data stored on the system. The desktop computers and the data servers require 
authentication for access and these computers and servers are assigned to authorized staff 
only.  
Only personnel approved to be on the study by [CONTACT_941] R&D Committees will be allowed access to 
these files. Personnel that are removed from t he study will have their access removed. To de -
identify and protect PHI, scrambled social security numbers and dates will be used in the 
Version: 1. 3, 05/25/[ADDRESS_1280147] study data during transmission. For example, VA 
sensitive information will be transmitted using Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 
140-2 compliant encryption tools  or Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) . In accordance with 
VA policy, incident reporting of theft, loss of data, loss of storage media, unauthorized access to 
sensitive data or storage media and non -compliance with security controls will be reported 
promptly to the study PI s, Privacy Officer and Information Security Officer . 
Upon study completion, all research data will be maintained and/or destroyed,  in accordance 
with the V HA Records Control Schedule  (RCS 10 -1) and VA Directive [ADDRESS_1280148]. As follow -up of 
Veterans continues for 1 year, we will continue to meet regularly to complete the objectives of 
the study.  
The regulatory documents, including CIRB communications, will be  maintained by [CONTACT_911347]. Seattle will also be monitoring serious adverse events 
related to study participation, which is limited to data security .

Exploratory Objectives: 
The e xploratory objectives include evaluation of  the pharmacokinetics (PK) of ibudilast (MN -166) 
using a population PK approach, correlations of cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872] (CSF) , and serum biomarkers with 
imaging and clinical measures of progressive disability , identification of unique phase 2 endpoints, and 
composite MRI scales (combining BPF, MTR, and DTI).  
Rationale:  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_261918] (RRMS), 
there are no therapi[INVESTIGATOR_261919] (MS) in the absence 
of relapses. The few studies showing efficacy of anti -inflammatory therapi[INVESTIGATOR_261920] -inflammatory effect of the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. There is gre at need for a safe, 
effective, and conveniently- administered therapy for progressive MS without overt inflammation.  
 Ibudilast (MN -166, AV411) is a small molecule macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) - and 
phosphodiesterase ( PDE ) 4, [ADDRESS_318672] represent a novel pharmacotherapy approach which may 
provide unmet needs in progressive MS. 
 
The original  rationale for the multiple sclerosis indication was the putative anti- inflammatory  effects of 
this drug. Using an  autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model in rats as an  experimental model for 
multiple sclerosis, the severity of acute EAE was significantly  ameliorated by [CONTACT_262092] ( Fujimoto  et al 1999).  In another study, ibudilast has been demonstrated to 
suppress pro -inflammatory cytokines in a dose -dependent manner, such as IL-1β , IL-6, and TNF-α, 
while increasing the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL -10 in LPS -treated microglial -neuronal co -cultures  
(Mizuno et al 2004).  Indeed, this anti -inflammatory profile combined with potential immunoregulatory 
action lead to its  consideration for utility in multip le sclerosis.  Two pi [INVESTIGATOR_261921]. One pi[INVESTIGATOR_261922] 3 
relapses per year. Sixty (60) mg of MN -166 was administered orally in three divided doses daily for 12 
to 20 months. MN -166 sign ificantly reduced the mean relapse rate by 48%, from 4.0 ± 0.9 before 
initiation of treatment to 2.1 ± 1.1 after treatment (p<0.05). (Sakoda  et al 2004)  A second pi[INVESTIGATOR_261923] -166 in patients w ith MS. In this 
trial, 12 patients with relapsing -remitting MS were administered 60 mg of MN -166 orally in 3 divided 
doses daily for 4 weeks. Serum Th1 and Th2 cytokine levels were measured before  and after 4 weeks 
of treatment . After treatment with MN -166, there was a tendency for Th1 cytokine mRNA such as IFN -
γ and TNF -α to be downregulated and for Th2 cytokine mRNA such as IL- 4 and IL -10 to be 
upregulated. This study showed that MN -166 induced a shift in the cytokine profile from Th1 towards  
Th2 and incr eased the natural killer T cell subset in MS patients (Feng  et al 2004 ).

6 A previous Phase 2 12-month randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled  trial evaluating MN -166 
30 and 60 mg /d vs. placebo followed by a  12-month  open -label extension  phase was conducted in 
Central Eastern Europe in RRMS subjects. Two -hundred, ninety -seven subjects were randomized; 95 
subjects to 30 mg /d, 99 subjects to 60 mg/d  and 103 subjects to placebo .  Subjects receiving MN -166 
(ibudilast ) 60 mg/d exhibited significantly red uced brain atrophy, persistent black hole formation (from 
gadolinium- enhancing lesions), time to relapse and EDSS progression vs. placebo (Barkhof et al 2010 ).  
A dose -response was evident between MN -166 at 30 and 60 mg/d with 60 mg/d demonstrating 
statistical significance for these endpoints.   Inflammation MRI endpoints were not significantly 
affected, providing the first therapy with evidence of primary neuroprotection independent from a 
substantial effect on overt inflammation.  Subset analyses of secon dary progressive multiple sclerosis 
(SPMS) patients or patients enrolling with EDSS ≥ 4.5 show improved EDSS and/or whole brain 
atrophy outcomes for the 60 mg/d vs . placebo group that were better than  the whole population 
(predominantly RRMS subjects).   
 During the 12-month double- blind core phase, m ore treatment -emergent  adverse events ( TEAEs ) were 
experienced by [CONTACT_262093] 60 mg /d group (26 TEAEs) compared to the 30 mg /d (18 TEAEs) or 
placebo group  (12 TEAEs) . The most common treatment- emergent  AEs were headache (n  =3) and 
nausea (n  =2) in the 30 mg/d ; nausea (n  =4), headache (n =3), vomiting (n  =2) and dizziness (n  =2) in 
the 60 mg /d group; and upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416] (n =5) and headache (n =2) in the placebo group.  
During the open -label extension phase, five additional treatment -related TEAEs occurred. These 
TEAEs were night cramps (60 mg /d), hepatotoxity (60 mg/d ), depression (60 mg /d), and pruritus (2 
subjects in placebo to 60 mg/d ).  
 Over the entire study, a total of 20 SAEs were reported by 19 subjects. Of these 20 SAEs, 12 SAEs 
were reported by 12 subjects in the core period and nine SAEs were reported by 7 subjects during the extension period. More subjects in the 60 mg/d  dose group (10.1%) experienced an SAE compared to 
the placebo  to 30 mg /d (5.8%), placebo to 60 mg/d  (3.9%), and 30 mg /d (4.2%) dose groups.
 Overall 
the most commonly reported SOCs for the SAEs were in Gastrointestinal Disorders and Injury, 
Poisoning and Procedural Complications categories. All  of the SAEs were considered by [CONTACT_262094] . Eight of the SAEs were considered by [CONTACT_262095] . No deaths occurred during the study.  
 
A total of 9 subjects disco ntinue d from the study due to a TEAE; t wo of these subjects had TEAEs that 
were considered to be treatment -related; hepatic st eatosis in the 30 mg /d group and hepatotoxicity  in 
the 60 mg /d group .  
 
The safety of MN -166 from 30 to 80 mg/d  has also been evaluated in single and multiple doses up to 
14 days has also been evaluated in healthy volunteer s and diabetes mellitus  Type 1 &2  patients and 
chronic pain patients  (diabetic neuropathy and complex regional pain syndrome) . MN -166 100 mg/d  
has been evaluated  in single and multiple doses for up to 8 days (followi ng 6 days of dose -incremental 
40, 60 and 80 mg /d dosing at 2 days each ) in healthy volunteers and diabetes mellitus Type 1  and 2 
patients . A Phase 1b safety study to evaluate MN-166 in methamphetamine -dependent addicts recently 
completed enrollment. In this study, subjects received 40 mg/d  for 1 week and then 100 mg/d  for 1 
week . Medication overuse headache  (MOH)  pain patients are currently being enrolled in a trial with 
dosing at 80  mg/d  for 2 months  and opi[INVESTIGATOR_261924] 100 mg/d for [ADDRESS_318673] positioned for primary neuroprotection in 
MS subjects (Fox 2010) and the dose -response data from this and other controlled neurological trials 
suggest that doses ≥ 60 mg /d may be ideal.   
This Phase [ADDRESS_318674] 
(MN -166) on imaging measures of brain atrophy and tissue integrity, to evaluate the safety and 
tolerability of 100 mg/d  (50 mg b.i.d. ) over 96 weeks, and to identify  imaging markers for measuring 
biologic activities of potential therapi[INVESTIGATOR_261925] . 
METHODOLOGY 
This is a multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel- group study designed to 
evaluate the safety, tolerability and activity of MN -166 administered twice daily over a 96 week  period 
in subjects with primary or secondary progressive multiple sclerosis who are currently untreated with 
long-term MS disease modifying therapy (DMT) or who are receiving either glatiramer acetate (GA) or 
interferon beta (IFNβ -1a [Avonex, Rebif ] or IFNβ -1b [Betaseron  Etavia ]) treatment.  Study drug will 
be administered as an adjunct to glatiramer or beta interferon treatment. A total of 250 male and female 
subjects from  21 to 65 years  old, inclusive, are planned to be enrolled into two treatment groups.  
Randomization of subjects will be stratified by  [CONTACT_20984] (PPMS or SPMS) and 
immunomodulating therapy status: current use of immunomodulating therapy or no current use of 
immunomodulating therapy .   
 The study will consist of a screening phase (up to 45 days) followed by a treatment p hase ( 96 weeks ) 
and a follow -up visit ([ADDRESS_318675] Week 96  visit).  Following the screening phase, subjects who 
continue to meet entry criteria will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups:  MN-166 100 
mg/d  or matching -placebo in a 1:1 ratio.  Study drug will be administered either b.i.d. ( ie, MN -166 50 
mg or placebo taken in the morning and evening)  or thre e times per day, depending on subject’s 
tolerance to ibudilast . 
Screening Phase (up to 45 days)  
During the screening phase, subjects will be assessed for study eligibility. The following assessments 
will be performed: medical/multiple sclerosis history including review of prior medications, physical examination including height and body weight, vital signs  and an  electrocardiogram .  Clinical la bs 
(chemistry, hematology,  lipid profile, and  urinalysis) including a serum pregnancy test for women of 
child -bearing potential  and a serum biomarker sample will be collected. An MRI of the brain will be 
performed at the Screening Visit (or within 1 week following the Screening Visit).  Following the MRI, 
an optional  lumbar puncture  (LP) will be performed. Other assessments to be conducted include 
cognitive tests ( Symbol D igit Modalities  Test and Selective Reminding Test), Short Form -36 Health 
Survey (SF -36), Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale -29 (MSIS -29), EuroQol 5 Dimensions ( EQ-5D), 
Suicide Behaviors Questionnaire -Revised (SBQ -R), Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), Multiple Sclerosis 
Functional Composite (MSFC), Expanded Disabilit y Status Scale (EDSS), and Optical  Coherence 
Tomography (OCT).    
Treatment Phase (96 weeks ) 
 The Baseline Visit must occur within 45 days following the Screening Visit.  At the Baseline Visit 
(Day 1), subjects who have completed all of the screening assessments and continue to meet eligibility 
criteria will be randomized to one of two treatment groups and will take their first dose of study 
medication on the evening of the Baseline Visit (Day 1) .  On the evening of Day 1, all the subjects will 
take 3 capsule of MN -166.  On the morning of Day 2, a ll subjects will begin a 3 capsule BID  (twice 
daily)  dosing regimen through Day 14 .  Subjects randomized to MN -166 will start at 60 mg /d (30 mg 
BID) and will remain on 60 mg /d through Day  14. Beginning on Day 15, all subjects will begin a 5 
capsule BID regimen ; those randomized to MN -166 will therefore be taking 100 mg /d (50 mg BID).

After Day 15, s ubjects with intolerable side -effects (eg nausea, diarrhea, vertigo) may reduce their dose 
to either 4 capsules twice a day (80  mg/d  for those taking ibudilast) or 3 capsules twice a day (60mg/d  
for those taking ibudilast). Subjects with intolerable side -effects ( eg nausea, diarrhea, vertigo) at the 
end of Day 14 may continue to taking 3 capsules twice a day at the Investigator’s discretion. At the 
investigator’s discretion, the daily dose of ibudilast can be changed between [ADDRESS_318676] maintain their then -current daily dose of study medication 
(3 capsules twice per day, 4 capsules twice per day, or 5 capsules twice per day) for the duration of the trial. Additionally, at the investigator’s discretion, the  daily dose of i budilast may be  divided and taken 
three times per day to  help improve tolerability.  
 
 
Subjects will return to the clinic for follow -up visits on a regular basis at Weeks 4 , 8, 12, 24, 36,  48, 60,  
72, 84 and 96 (see Table 1 Schedule of Assessments).   
 Subjects who experience a relapse will return to the clinic within three days of notifying the 
Investigator and will undergo assessments described in Table 2 Schedule of Unplanned Procedures and 
Assessments).  
 Subjects who prematurely discontinue study me dication will continue to be followed on a semi-annual 
basis  (Table 2 Schedule of Unplanned Procedures and Assessments ) unti l the end of the study (Week 
96). 
 
For subjects who are no longer taking study drug and are being followed on a semi -annual basis (Wk 
24, 48, 72, 96), adverse events will not be collected post study drug discontinuation.  Existing AEs will 
be followed until the AE resolves or stabilizes.  
Follow -up Phase  
All subjects who complete the study active on study medication will return for a follow -up safety visit 
at Week 100 ([ADDRESS_318677] study visit) to assess general health and adverse event status.   
Number of Subjects (Planned):  The number of randomized subjects planned for this study is 250: 125 
in the placebo treatment group and 125 in MN -166 100 mg /d treatment group.

Tertiary and Exploratory Endpoints:  see Objectives above .  
Pharmacokinetic: Plasma samples for analysis of ibudilast and its metabolite, 6,7 -dihydrodiol ( DHD ), 
will be collected and population PK analysis will be performed.  
Safety Monitoring :  After [ADDRESS_318679] 60 days, the Medical Safety Monitor will review pooled (i.e., blinded to treatment) 
safety data provided by [CONTACT_262102] g Center. Beginning after approximately month 3 of 
enrollment start, a National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) Data and Safety 
Monitoring Board (DSMB) will meet e very six months during the study (and more often, if deemed 
necessary) , and will review blinded safety data including adverse events and serious adverse events  
(SAE) .  Efficacy data may also be reviewed if warranted, as determined by [CONTACT_4318]. The DSMB will 
be empowered to recommend stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_29921]. The group’s mandates and membership will be described in the NeuroNEXT DSMB Guideline .

12 Statistical Methods  
Analysis Populations:  
The modified Intent -to-Treat (mITT) Population : The primary population for analysis is the mITT, 
which is defined as all subjects who are randomized and receive at least one dose of study medication 
and have at least one efficacy assessment in the double-blind phase. Subjects will be analyze d based on 
the treatment to which they are randomized.  
The Per Protocol (PP) Population:  The per -protocol population includes all mITT subjects who 
satisfy the following conditions: 
• Have 75% -125% compliance, both limit values inclusive in the double -blind phase  
• Have no major protocol deviations, determined by a blinded data review  
Endpoint Analysis:  
All imaging endpoints will be statistically evaluated using linear mixed models (LMMs: Laird and 
Ware 1982). LMMs are advantageous for longitudinal clinical trials because they can account for the 
dependency due to repeated measures with relatively few parameters, which potentially enhances 
statistical efficiency. Furthermore, LMMs can accommodate incomplete cases ( ie, missing data), which 
is expected  in this study due to dropout. LMMs are typi[INVESTIGATOR_261928] (Verbeke and Molenberghs 2000) that yield valid inferences with incomplete cases under the 
widely applicable assumption that the missing data are ignorable ( Little  and Rubin 2002) . For all 
analyses, the residuals of the fitted statistical models will be examined for evidence of departure from assumptions, such as normality. If assumptions appear to be grossly violated, then transformations of response variables migh t be considered. Alternatively, generalized LMMs might be used because of 
their ability to accommodate a wider range of distributional forms ( eg, beta distribution).  The primary 
analysis will be conducted using a modified intent -to-treat analysis, which includes all subjects who are 
randomized and receive at least one dose of study medication in the double -blind phase.  Since this is a 
phase [ADDRESS_318680] that exceeds the 0.10 significance  level. To account for baseline imbalance due to randomization vagaries, the baseline 
group means (intercepts) in the statistical analysis will be constrained to be equal. Sensitivity analyses 
will be conducted using brain atrophy as measured by [CONTACT_262103] ( ie, non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) that were 
unbalanced between treatment groups. Safety Analysis:  
The safety analyses will be conducted using the double- blind safety population, defined as subjects 
who are randomized and receive at least one dose of study medication in the double -blind phase.  
Adverse events (AEs), discontinuation due to AEs, and serio us adverse events (SAE) will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_1601], for each treatment group, the number and percentage of subjects with any AE, and AEs by [CONTACT_6657]. Adverse events will be further summarized by 
[CONTACT_110204]. The summary will be limited to treatment- emergent AEs.  
Sample Size Justification:   
Estimated required sample for the primary objective was computed from pi[INVESTIGATOR_261929].  The pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299] (considered the control group) c onsisted of N = 36 relapse -remitting ( RR) and 
secondary progressive ( SP) participants with up to 3 annual BPF measures from the same 3T scanner.  
Unpublished pi[INVESTIGATOR_261930] a published study (Altmann et al 2008) suggested a reasonable range of 
percentage difference was 30% to 50%.  Also, using a different atrophy metric and only [ADDRESS_318681] RRMS Phase 2 trial observed a 33% -36% slowing in brain atrophy (Barkhof et al 2010).  
Based on these assum ptions, a sample size of N =125 subjects per treatment arm provides power close 
to 80% for effects of 33% or larger (assuming a type I error rate of 0.10).

25 4. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
4.1. Introduction  
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex autoimmune disease with predominantly unknown etiology 
currently affects approximately 2.[ADDRESS_318699].  The degenerative and inflammatory changes are associated with the formation of sclerotic plaques due, in part, to abnormal hardening and fibrosis of the neuronal myelin sheath.  The symptoms are diverse, ranging from tremor, nystagmus, paralysis, and disturbances in speech and vision.  Symptoms of the disease often occur in early adult life with characteristic exacerbations and remissions.  
   
Relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) is the most common type of the disease, accounting for 65%-85% of patients.  Most patients with RRMS eventually progress to the secondary progressive (SPMS) form of the disease.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_261933] (RRMS), there are no therapi[INVESTIGATOR_261934]. The few studies showing efficacy of anti- inflammatory therapi[INVESTIGATOR_261935]- inflammatory effect of the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  Currently, mitoxantrone is the only FDA-
approved therapy for secondary progressive MS, but is not commonly used because of its risks of heart injury and blood cancers ( ie leukemia).  There is a great need for a safe, effective, and 
conveniently- administered therapy for patients with progressive MS without overt inflammation. 
Ibudilast (MN -166) may meet these needs.  
 The Phase [ADDRESS_318700]  (MN-166/AV411) background 
Ibudilast is a n anti- inflamm atory/ne uroprotective agent that has been in use for over 20 years in 
Japan and some other Asian countries for the treatment of asthma and cerebrovascular disorders 
(post -stroke dizzine ss) with 30mg/d  dosage based on attenuating airway hypersensitivity and 
improving cerebral blood flow, respectively ( Kawasaki et al 1992; Fukuyama et al 1993).  
Ibudilast, in delayed- release capsule format, is marketed as Ketas® (via innovator, Kyorin 
Pharmaceuticals) or Pi[INVESTIGATOR_261936]® (a generic by [CONTACT_16956]/Taisho Pharmaceuticals).  While ibudilast has 
not yet been approved for any conditions outside of Asia, clinical development for neurological 
conditions, including multiple sclerosis, neuropathic pain, and certain drug addictions, has been 
undertaken by [CONTACT_262104]. (as AV411) and MediciNova Inc. (as MN -166). (Ledeboer  et al 
2007a; Ledeboer et al 2007b; Rolan  et al  2009, Barkhof et al 2010) These entities merged at the 
end of [ADDRESS_318701] assets could be integrated with continued development as MN-
166 with MediciNova (San Diego, CA).   
Ibudilast distributes well to the CNS and it is a selective inhibitor of certain cyclic nucleotide 
phosphodiesterases (Gibson et al  2006) and the pro-inflammatory cytokine, macrophage 
migration inhibitory factor (MIF) (Cho  et al  2010 ).  At clinically -relevant plasma or CNS 
concentrations, ibudilast selectively inhibits macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) and, 
secondarily, PDEs-3, 4 and -10.  MIF inhibition or knockout has been linked to attenuated 
disease progression in animal models of MS (Powell et al 2005;  Kithcart et al 2010) and 
attenuates neuronal death and promotes recovery in mouse spi[INVESTIGATOR_1828] ( Nishio  et al  2009).  
Another MIF knockout study reveals its role in neurodegeneration in experimental stroke model (Inacio  et al  2011).  PDE inhibition has likewise shown some neuroprotective actions ( Chen  et al 
2007; Nakamizo et al  2003).   
The original rationale for the multiple sclerosis indication was the putative anti- inflammator y 
effects of this drug. Using autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model in rats as an 
experimental model for multiple sclerosis, the severity of acute EAE was significantly ameliorated by [CONTACT_262105] (Fujimoto  et al  1999).  Ibudilast has 
been demonstrated to suppress, in a dose-dependent manner, pro- inflammatory cytokines such as 
IL-1 beta, IL- 6, and TNF -alpha, while increasing the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in LP S-
treated primary microglial -neuronal cultures (Mizuno  et al  2004).  Indeed, this anti- inflammatory 
profile combined with potential immunoregulatory action lead to its consideration for utility in MS. Two pi[INVESTIGATOR_261937]. One pi[INVESTIGATOR_261922] 3 relapses per year. Sixty (60) mg of MN-
166 was administered orally in three divided doses daily for 12 to 20 months. MN- 166 
significantly reduced the mean relapse rate by 48%, from 4.0 ± 0.9 before initiation of treatment 
to 2.1 ± 1.1 after treatment (p<0.05). The mean Expanded Disability Status Score (EDSS) was 
4.3 ± 2.0 before the treatment and 4.8 ± 2.6 after treatment, but this difference was not 
significant (Sakoda et al  2004) A second pi[INVESTIGATOR_261938]-166 in patients with MS. In this trial, 12 patients with 
relapsing -remitting MS were administered 60 mg of MN-166 orally in 3 divided doses daily for 
4 weeks. Serum Th1 and Th2 cytokine levels were measured before and after 4 weeks of 
treatment. After 4 weeks of treatment with MN -166, TNF-α mRNA decreased in all but one 
patient and this change was statistically significant. After treatment with MN -166, there was a 
tendency for Th1 cytokine mRNA such as IFN-γ and TNF-α to be downregulated and for Th2

27 cytokine mRNA such as IL -4 and IL-10 to be upregulated. The reductions in IFN-γ and TNF- α 
were statistically significant. This study showed that MN-166 induced a shift in the cytokine 
profile from Th1 towardsTh2 and increased the natural killer T cell subset in MS pat ients ( Feng  
et al 2004). More recently, ibudilast has been recognized to have glial attenuating activity in 
vitro and in vivo.  Researchers identified activation of glial cells (astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocytes) as an important component of the pathogenesis and/or maintenance of 
multiple sclerosis  and neuropathic pain (Sloane et al 2009; Watkins et al 2003; DeLeo and 
Yezierski 2001).  Notably, ibudilast treatment was also shown in a rodent genetic model of 
Krabbe’s neurodegeneration (Twitcher mouse) to reduce demyelination, apoptosis, and pro-
inflammatory cytokine expression (Kagitani-Shimono et al  2005).  Additional means by [CONTACT_262106] 
(NGF, GDNF, NT -4) in glial -neuronal co -cultures (Mizuno et al  2004), and inhibition of MIF 
which has been linked to neurodegeneration (Inacio et al  2011; Kithcart et al 2010).

4.3.1. Formulation of the Drug to be Studied  
MN-[ADDRESS_318702] utilized is licensed in Japan and 
manufactured under Japanese CGMP  guidelines and distributed as Pi[INVESTIGATOR_261936]®. It is the same 
product which has been used in Avigen/MediciNova clinical trials for several years.  
4.4. Pre-clinical toxicology  
4.4.1. Pre-clinical study overview  
The following provides an overview of the toxicity findings in the various species studied.  In each case, the dose at which a toxic effect is seen in the animal is related to th e Human 
Equivalent Dose (HED). For more detail on the results of the pre- clinical findings, consult the 
Investigator’s Brochure.  
4.4.2. Evaluation of organ- and species -specific findings  
The acute oral toxicity established in the rat, dog and monkey, was only evident with human 
equivalent dosing (HED) regimens (and generally plasma ibudilast exposures) >25- fold a single 
high-dose human oral administration in ongoing or planned trials ( eg, 50 mg in a 50 mg BID 
dosing regimen). Specific organ toxicity with ibudilast treatment has not been clearly defined in acute toxicity  studies in multiple species as organ histopathology was performed only in a GLP 
rat study wherein some unscheduled- sacrifice rats at the highest -dose (400 mg/kg PO ) exhibited 
abnormal findings including discoloration in the glandular and non-glandular stomach, myocardial degeneration and hemorrhage in a few rats, sublingual salivary gland degeneration and inflammation, and thymic lymphocyte necrosis and splenic lymphocyte depletion.   
 All adverse findings of behavioral or pathological (clinical pathology or histopathology) nature in repeat- dose animal toxicology studies were either markedly or completely recovered in 
dedicated recovery groups.  Other findings including inappetance and body weight gain, and/or serum chemistry changes were similarly reversed in recovery groups. At necropsy, occasional 
Protocol NN102 SPRINT -MS with Amendment 6.[ADDRESS_318703] QD in studies ranging in duration from 2 weeks to 6 months 
given doses many multiples of the proposed human exposure. In all cases, no abnormal changes in serum chemistry or urinalysis markers of renal function were seen.  Some corollary with serum 
GGT elevation , not considered a renal toxicity marker, was observed.  
 Specifically, in a two -week dose escalation study in rats given up to 225 mg/kg orally for the 
final week, oral rat dose levels wherein the proximal tubule effect was identified were ≥ 125 
mg/kg (human equivalent dosing (HED) margin ≥ 13- fold a 100 mg/d clinical regimen, and with 
end-of-study peak plasma ibudilast concentrations exceeding that correlating with the 50 mg BID 
regimen.    In a 28-day oral dose study in rats given up to 600 mg/kg daily the lowest dose given that resulted in tubular toxicity corresponded to a 42-fold human equivalent dose (HED) and the key PK parameters of C
max and AUC at end -of-study exceeded that corresponding to steady 100 mg/d  
clinical regimens for C max, but with daily AUC below the clinical correlate.  
 In a [ADDRESS_318704] up to 400 mg/kg where renal tubular 
regeneration rather than degeneration or necrosis was o bserved, the HED margin was 26- fold 
and end- of-study peak plasma concentration exceeded a human 100 mg/d correlate. 
 Interestingly, in a 16-month oral toxicology study that included doses up to 200 mg/kg in male and female rats, no renal tubule abnormaliti es were noted.  
 In conclusion, the high dose/exposure renal tubule effects seen only in the rat, were not more evident ( eg, greater magnitude and/or observed at lower doses) in chronic dosing conditions 
compared to 2-4 week dosing periods, and ‘new’ toxicity was not clearly evident in dog, rat, or monkey studies of 13-week to 39-week duration, or even in 2- year rats studies, that were not 
apparent in the shorter sub-chronic studies.  The renal toxicity seen in rats dosed orally was not observed following subcutaneous dosing of 
ibudilast, even with plasma ibudilast and DHD exposures similar to that observed with oral dosing.  Moreover, adverse renal pathology was  not observed in oral dosing in a 2-week rabbit 
toxicology study nor in 2-, 4-, or 39- week toxicol ogy studies in cynomolgus monkeys– and was, 
likewise, not observed with SC  dosing of dogs over 2-, 4-, and 13-week durations with HED and 
plasma ibudilast TK parameters exceeding that correlating with human 50 mg BID regimens [C
max 116 ng/ml, AUC 0-24h 1613 ng*hr/ml, study AV411-026].   
 
The plasma metabolite (6,7 -DHD) : ibudilast ratios in various toxicology species and studies 
were consistently > that observed in humans thus contributing to safety confidence and margin.

30 The potential toxicity of major metabolites, and impurities within the drug substance itself,  or 
it’s degradation products has been evaluated at least acutely and shown to have low intrinsic toxicity (LD
50>600 mg/kg in rodents). This provides a toxicity safety margins >400- fold 
compared to a human dose from a mg/kg perspective.  
Inconsistent, but noted in some treatment group monkeys was cytoplasmic alteration in the  adrenal  cortex at oral ibudilast dosing ≥ 100 mg/kg/d (HED margin >22-fold 100 mg/d clinical 
regimen) in a 28-day study but not in a 39- week chronic toxicity, even at daily oral  doses of 
150-200 mg/kg.  
 Hyperplasia of the rat non -glandular stomach, an organ with no human correlate, was observed 
in one but not in a repeat subchronic and in chronic rat – the clinical significanc e cannot be 
determined.  Mammary lobular hyperplasia of mild -moderate nature was observed in a dose independent 
fashion in the majority of female rats receiving ibudilast at 50 -400 mg/kg in the 26- week oral rat 
study, but not in other toxicology studies (including the 16- month oral rat toxicity study at doses 
up to 200 mg/kg): it was not evident in recovery animals.  Likewise, thyroid follicular cell 
hypertrophy of a minimal magnitude was observed in two oral rat toxicology studies (2- week 
study 7613-105 and 26-week study 1123-017) in several animals at  the highest doses (>125-200 
mg/kg in study 7613-105, 250- 400 mg/kg in study 1123-017) and with plasma ibudilast 
exposures exceeding human [ADDRESS_318705] article autoimmune response.   While it was not generally observed in vehicle controls, the findings were not dose -related in terms of frequency nor severity.  Such potential indicators of 
autoimmunity were not called out in other secondary lymphoid organs.  Notably, such findings were not highlighted over dosing durations and in species in which an autoimmune action might be expected to present including:  4-week dog or monkey studies, a 13-week dog study, 26- week 
or 16 -month rat toxicology studies – and at doses and plasma exposures covering similar or 
greater ranges than the [ADDRESS_318706] levels over time (see Sanftner et al 2009).  Such liver changes and enzyme 
induction was not so evident with SC dosing of rats, rabbits, or dogs nor orally-dosed monkeys.  
 Ibudilast treatment has been carefully studied in cardiovascular, pulmonary, CNS, 
carcinogenicity (via a feed approach in rats), genetic, antigenicity or dependence studies across 
multiple species and high doses/exposures/concentrations.  Results are summarized in the Investigator’s Brochure.   
 
Protocol NN102 SPRINT -MS with Amendment 6.[ADDRESS_318707] 100 mg/d  (eg, 50 mg BID; ~1.5 mg/kg/d). This 
was determined in multiple species from both acute and chronic dosing studies and ranged from 5-11- fold by [CONTACT_262108] (HED) extrapolation from the oral dosing studies, (higher in 
shorter -term studies), and 2.6-3.7-fold for the 13- week SC rat and dogs studies.  
  The plasma ibudilast (and DHD) C
max and AUC toxicokinetic correlates for NOAELs in the  ≥ 
13-week (and shorter) studies in rats and dogs are generally > human 100 mg/d steady- state PK 
parameters.  The orally -dosed subchronic and chronic monkey studies tended to have lower 
plasma ibudilast levels, likely due to high metabolism and low oral bioav ailability, but still in the 
context of very high oral doses and hence drug exposures via a relevant route.

The safety of ibudilast from 30 to 80 mg/d  has been evaluated in single and multiple doses up to 
14 days in healthy volunteers and diabetes mellitus Type 1 & 2 patients , chronic pain patients 
(diabetic neuropathy and complex regional pain syndrome) and opi[INVESTIGATOR_261941]. The 
dosage of  100 mg/d  has been evaluated in single and multiple doses for up to 8 days (following 6 
days of dose -incremental 40, 60 and 80 mg/d  dosi ng at 2 days each) in healthy volunteers (HV) 
and diabetes mellitus  (DM) Type 1 & 2 patients.  In a phase 2 study MS trial, subjects received 
MN-166 30 or 60mg /d up to 2 years (96 weeks). An ongoing Phase 1b safety study to evaluate 
MN-166 in methamphetamine-dependent addicts recently completed enrollment. In this study, 
subjects received MN-166 40mg /d for 1 week and then 100 mg/d  for 1 week.  O ther ongoing 
trials include dosage of 100  mg/d for 3 wee ks to opi[INVESTIGATOR_9828] (with Columbia 
Univ ersity /NYSPI [INVESTIGATOR_261942]) and dosing for 8 weeks at 80 mg/d  in chronic medication 
overuse headache (MOH) pain at the Univ ersity of  Adelaide with a prior AV411 investigator.   
Notably, all of the trials listed in the table except for the first two have included all concurrent 
concomitant medications with ibudilast dosing at 80 or 100 mg/d .  While pharmacokinetic drug-
drug interactions have not been carefully assessed (or are in progress), there are no clear 
pharmacologic or safety interactions noted to date.  Also, pharmacokinetics have been closely monitored in almost all of the trials an d from the data of Study MN -166/AV411, the  PK has 
generally been shown to be dose-proportional both within and between studies.  Based on prior trials, steady state plasma C
max and AUC 0-24h levels at the highest dose (50 mg BID; 100 mg/d) 
are anticipated t o be approximately 116 ng/ml (C max) and 1613 ng*hr/ml (AUC 0-24h) (study 
AV411-026 HV group).

4.6.1. Published safety summary from experience in Japan  
 The largest accumulation of clinical safety experience with ibudilast is from the approval of 
Ketas
® for asthma and post- stroke dizziness. Dosing was usually 20 to 30 mg/d  (included uses 
up to 40 mg/d ) and based on chronic administration. In the package insert, the most common 
adverse events were anorexia (0.6%), n ausea (0.6%), increased liver enzymes (ALT 0.4%, AST 
0.3%, and GTP 0.4%). A summary table of frequently observed AEs (from Ketas® package 
insert) is below.

5%) occurred in the SOCs of Infections and Infestations (36%), Nervous System Disorders 
(19%), Gastrointestinal Disorders (15%), Psychiatric Disorders (13%), General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions (9%), and Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders (7%). No significant differences in TEAEs by [CONTACT_262111]. There was a slight dose related increase in the percent of subjects with gastrointestinal AEs : 8%, 
12%, and 15% for placebo, 30 mg/d, and 60 mg/d  treatment groups, respectively.  
 During the core -period, more treatment -related TEAEs were experienced by [CONTACT_262093] 60 
mg/d group (26 TEAEs) compared to the 30 mg/d  (18 TEAEs) or placebo group (12 TEAEs). 
The most common treatment -related AEs were headache (n  =3) and nausea (n =2) in the 30 
mg/d; nausea (n =4), headache (n =3), vomiting (n=2) and dizziness (n =2) in the 60 mg/d  group; 
and upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416] (n =5) and headache (n =2) in the placebo group.   During the 12- month  open -label extension period, five additional treatment- related TEAEs 
occurred. These TEAEs were night cramps ([ADDRESS_318715] 60 mg/d ), hepatotoxity ([ADDRESS_318716] 60 
mg/d), depression ([ADDRESS_318717] 60 mg/d ), and pruritus (2 subjects in placebo to 60 mg/d ).  
 Over the  entire 24-month study, the most frequently occurring AEs (≥ 2% of subjects) were 
nasopharyngitis (20%), headache (14%), urinary tract infection (9%), pharyngitis (6%), nausea (5%), anxiety (4%), insomnia (4%), asthenia (4%), pyrexia (4%), diarrhoea (3%),v omiting (3%) 
iron deficiency anemia (3%), hypertension (3%), depressed mood (3%), depression (3%), upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092] (3%), hypercholesterolaemia (2%), back pain (2%), rhinitis (2%), and sinusitis (2%).  Gastrointestinal AEs occurred in a pe rcentage of subjects: 10%, 12%, 17%, and 
18% for placebo to 30 mg/d , placebo to 60 mg/d , 30 mg/d , and 60 mg/d  treatment groups, 
respectively.  There was a slight increase in gastrointestinal AEs in the percent of subjects who received MN -166 treatment for 24 months.  
 Over the entire 24 -month study, a total of 2 1 SAEs were reported by 20 subjects. SAEs were 
reported by 12 subjects in the core period and nine SAEs were reported by 7 subjects during the extension period. More subjects in the 60 mg/d  dose group (10/99 [10.1%] ) experienced an SAE 
compared to other active group. Four subjects in placebo group (4/103 [3.8%] ) experienced 
SAEs during core period while on placebo, [ADDRESS_318718] (1/48 [2.1%] ) 
experienced an SAE during the extension-period while on 60 mg/d dosage and 4 subjects in the 
30mg /d dose group (4/95 [4.2%] ) experienced an SAE.  The SAEs were as follows: acetabulum 
fracture, duodenal ulcer perforation, calculus ureteric, and menorrhagia in the placebo group; inguinal hernia, epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], peptic ulcer perforation, fibula fracture and menorrhagia in the 30 mg/d  
group; and bladder diverticulum, epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], intervertebral disc protrusion, pneumonia haemophilus, uterine cancer, gastrointestinal malignant neoplasms, retinal detachment, hip surgery, depression, acute pancreatitis, ankle fracture and congenital anomaly resulting in death (partner pregnancy) in the 60 mg/d  group . All of these SAEs were considered by [CONTACT_262112]102 SPRINT -MS with Amendment 6.[ADDRESS_318719] SE -001- 009 who was 
diagnosed with gastrointestinal malignant neoplasms died due to this SAE approximately 1 year 
after he withdrew from the study due to this SAE.   A total of nine subjects discontinued from the study due to a TEAE. Two of these subjects experienced a TEAE that were considered to be related to study drug; hepatic steatosis (severe) and hepatotoxicity (moderate) treated with 30 mg/d  and 60 mg/d , respe ctively.  None of the other 
TEAEs (duodenal ulcer perforation, osteoarthritis, tachycardia, epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], uterine cancer, gastrointestinal neoplasm, acute pancreatitis) that resulted in study discontinuation were considered to be related to study medication by  [CONTACT_1697].  
 
4.6.4. Abnormal Laboratory Test Values in the clinical trials 
Ibudilast- related changes in clinical chemistry or hematology endpoints have been infrequent and 
not clearly dose- related. Two treatment -related adverse events of ALT and AST increases have 
been observed  in Phase 1 studies AV411- 016 and AV411-026. In a single dose study in healthy 
volunteers (AV411-016), one protocol -defined dose limiting toxicity was encountered in one 
subject in the 50mg cohort. Subject [ADDRESS_318720]’s ALT was 82 U/L, slightly over twice the ULN; AST value is unknown.  Liver function tests returned to normal on Day 20.  One diabetic subject (subject 2004) in study AV411- 026 experienced increases in ALT to 83  IU/L on Day 15 
(one day post last dose of AV411 50 mg bid), 74 IU/L on Day 16  and  117 IU/L on Day 24 ([ADDRESS_318721] dose of study drug) which were considered by [CONTACT_262113]; on Day 36, ALT levels returned to normal limits. In the MN-166- CL-001 
study in MS patients , 3 subjects had clinically significant ALT/AST elevation s. One  subject ( SE-
004-069) on MN -166 30mg/d   experienced the adverse  event of hepatic steatosis  at [ADDRESS_318722]’ s ALT was 3 23 U/L, AST 153 U/L. This event was considered possibly related to study 
drug by  [CONTACT_262114] . His ALT and AST level 
returned to normal as recorded a t the 9 month early termination visit.  One patient (subject SE -004-
068), after receiving 10 months of MN-166 60 mg /d, he had an acute pancreatitis event  with ALT 
increased to 691 U/L and the AST to164 U/L. Amylase was 855 U/L  at the time of admission into 
the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. The patient was withdrawn from the study and the event was considered by [CONTACT_262115]. The lab values 1 week after admission  were:  ALT 14 1 
U/L, AST 105 U/L and GGT 25 1 U/L. His early termination follow up lab value at 11 months was 
ALT 85  U/L, GGT 117 U/ L; his other labs returned to normal.   Another patient ( SE-003-057) 
after receiving 22 months of N-166 60 mg/d had an adverse event of hepatotoxicity (ALT 98 U/L, 
AST 87 U/L and GGT 259 U/L) which was considered by [CONTACT_262116]. This patient was withdrawn from the study and ALT was 76  
U/L and other values returne d to normal at [ADDRESS_318723] was non- compliant and was taking "24 
capsules more."  
Two isolated  GGT elevation have also been observed  in the MN-166 and placeb o treatment 
groups:  one healthy volunteer in the AV411-009  trial had an adverse event of a mild elevation

which was considered by [CONTACT_262117] -002, one subject in the placebo group exhibited a [ADDRESS_318724], BUN and creatinine : 
these changes were  thought to be related to study drug.  
 
4.6.5. Safety Overview for Higher Dosage  
In general, clinical trials involving ibudilast dosing with 8 days (up to 100 mg/d ) or 2  weeks  (to 
80 mg/d) or 2  years (to 60 mg/d), safety findings that warrant concern  have not appeared to 
increase with increased duration of treatment.  The results to date suggest acceptable safety and 
tolerability at doses of 60  to 100 mg/d , without an apparent accumulation of AEs or toxicity over 
time. Any  potential study drug- related adverse events can be identified by [CONTACT_262118]. Additionally, in the recently 
completed trial in medication overuse headache (MOH) subjects at 80  mg/d for [ADDRESS_318725] common AE reported was nausea, which occurred more frequently in the MN-166- treated  
group but was generally mild and was managed by [CONTACT_46431]-the-counter anti- emetics and /or 
temporarily ceasing the medication and rein stating at a lower dose and titrating  upward to the 
original dose. In the   UCLA methamphetamine addiction study, subjects received  100 mg/d   
MN-166 for 7 d following 1 week at 40  mg/d before or after of 1 week of placebo . No significant 
difference or trend w as observed in the frequency of study drug- related AEs.   In the ongoing 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_261946] , subjects  receive 100 mg/d MN-166 for 3 
weeks  or 7 d and are progressing without apparent safety/tolerability concerns.  
Focusing on the clinical trials involving single and multiple dosing regimens of 80-100 mg/d , 
which is most relevant to the proposed protocol, AEs have been generally GI -related as 
summarized in the table below. Tolerability issues with ibudilast dosing tend to be gastrointestinal (GI) in nature and are somewhat, but not consistently, dose -related.  Nausea 
tends to be more commonly observed followed by [CONTACT_262119] a small subset of patients.  In the RRMS trial and in other repeat ed dosing trials , when GI distress was observed, 
there appear ed to be some accommodation to these side effects within 1 -2 weeks of dosing.  
A summary of frequently reported t reatment related AEs in the 80-100 mg /d  dosage group from 
completed and ongoing studies are summarized below.

40 4.7. Dose rationale  
 
The efficacy result from the previous Phase 2 MS trial  indicated that patients receiving 60 mg/d 
exhibited significantly reduce d  brain volume loss,  reduced progression to persistent black hole 
formation (from gadolinium-enhancing lesions), extended time to first relapse and  reduced  
EDSS progression vs. Placebo (Barkhof et al  2010) (see figure below).  A dose- response was 
evident between the 30 and 60 mg/d regimens, with 60 mg/d statistically significant, for all but 
EDSS.  Inflammation MRI endpoints were not significantly affected, implicating ibudilast as 
perhaps one of the first therapi[INVESTIGATOR_261947] -
inflammatory or immunosuppressive action.   
 
  
  
 
  p < 0.05 at 60 mg/d for Time to 1st relapse, Brain Volume Loss, and Progression to PBH 
 
Brain atrophy, as measured by [CONTACT_262120] (PBVC), was -0.95% and -1.2% in 
the placebo group at [ADDRESS_318726] treatment attenuated atrophy by 
~13% at the low dose and ~35% (p<0.05) at 60 mg/d.    The Phase [ADDRESS_318727] positioned for primary 
neuroprotection in MS patients (Fox  2010) and the dose- response data here and in other 
translational neuropharmacology suggest that doses ≥60 mg/d  may be suitable to demonstrate 
efficacy in patient population.   Pain is reported in ~50% of MS patients, is considered to be  neuro pathic in the majority of those 
patients, and is more prevalent in progressive forms of MS (Grau- Lopez  et al 2011; Österberg et 
al 2005).  There is a recognized need for effective pharmacotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_261948] (50th %)

clinical utility therein.

4.8. Potential Drug -Drug Interactions  
Ibudilast is not expected to exhibit pharmacokinetic drug- drug interactions with 
immunomodulating therapi[INVESTIGATOR_261951].  Patients in the proposed progressive MS 
trial may remain on their glatiramer acetate or interferon -beta therapy.  While the metabolism 
and pharmacokinetics of ibudilast are described in the Investigator’s Brochure, specific notation of potential interactions with glatiramer acetate or interferon -beta is not noted herein.  
Pharmacokinetic interactions are not anticipated wit h ibudilast co- administration in either case:  
glatiramer acetate is a small polypeptide mixture and not reported to involve cytochrome P450 metabolism nor induction; interferon -beta-[ADDRESS_318728] some inhibitory action on CYP1A2 
(medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm).  As ibudilast is neither a potent inducer nor an inhibitor of 1A2 
and is not notably metabolized by 1A2 in human isozyme metabolic studies, pharmacokinetic interactions a re not anticipated.  Moreover, pharmacodynamic interactions of note have not been 
reported, to our knowledge.  One remote option considered relates to bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394]. It is a substrate of CYP2B6 and if ibudilast were to induce CYP2B6 then there may be some incr eased 
metabolism, reduced effectiveness, of this anti-depressant.  There has been some concomitant 
medication history with Wellbutrin
® in our trials with no apparent pharmacodynamics adverse 
outcomes.  Moreover, as has been published separately, and as we have observed in our own 
clinical trials, there have been no declines in steady -state plasma ibudilast levels with multi-
day/week dosing which provides some additional support that  neither 2B6 nor other enzymes 
participating in ibudilast metabolism are no t noticeably induced. Finally, ibudilast in conjunction 
with other drugs has not yielded DDI (drug- drug interaction), at least in terms of plasma ibudilast

Protocol NN102 SPRINT -MS with Amendment 5.[ADDRESS_318729] (MN -166) in subjects with primary and secondary 
progressive multiple sclerosis . 
5.1. Primary Objective  
 
The primary objectives of the study are:  
 
• to evaluate the activity of ibudilast ( MN-166) (100 mg/d ) versus pla cebo at 96 weeks  as 
measured by [CONTACT_262082] (MRI) analysis for whole brain 
atrophy using brain parenchymal fraction (BPF).  
• to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ibudilast ( MN-166) ( 100 mg/d ) versus placebo 
administered orally in subjects with primary and secondary  progressive multiple sclerosis. 
5.2. Secondary Objectives  
 
The major secondary objectives are to evaluate the activity of ibudilast (MN -166) at 96 weeks 
versus placebo as measured by:  
 
• Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in descending pyramidal white matter tracts  
• Magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) imaging in normal-appearing brain tissue   
• Retinal nerve fiber layer as measured by [CONTACT_262121] (OCT)  
• Cortical atrophy as measured by [CONTACT_262084] (CLADA )  
 
The additional secondary outcomes are to measure the activity of ibudilast (MN -166) at 96 
weeks  versus placebo on:  
 
• Inflammatory disease activity, as measured by T1  lesion volume, T2 lesion volume, and 
annualized relapse rate  
• Disability, as measured by [CONTACT_262101] (EDSS) and Multiple Sclerosis 
Functional Composite (MSFC)  
• Cognitive impairment  as measured by [CONTACT_262122] t he Selective 
Reminding Test  
• Quality of Life, as measured by [CONTACT_262087] (MSIS -29), EuroQol 5 
Dimensions (EQ-5D), and Short Form- 36 Health Survey (SF -36) 
• Neuropathic pain, as measured by [CONTACT_262088] (BPI) 
5.3. Tertiary Objectives  
 The first set of tertiary objectives are to evaluate the activity of ibudilast (MN -166) at one year 
versus placebo as measured by [CONTACT_262089]: whole 
brain atrophy using brain parenchymal fraction (BPF), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in 
descending pyramidal white matter tracts, magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) imaging in normal -appearing brain tissue,  retinal nerve fiber layer  (RNFL)  as measured by [CONTACT_262123]102 SPRINT -MS with Amendment 6.0                                               08 Aug 2017

 coherence tomography (OCT) , and cortical atrophy as meas ured by [CONTACT_262124] (CLADA ). 
 
The second set of tertiary objectives are to evaluate the activity of ibudilast (MN -166) at 96 
weeks  versus placebo as measured by, whole-brain gray matter fraction, magnetization transfer  
ratio ( MTR ) in gray matter, new T1 lesions since baseline, and new T2 lesions since baseline. 
 
5.4. Exploratory Objectives  
The exploratory objectives include evaluation of the pharmacokinetics (PK) of ibudilast (MN -
166) using a population PK approach, correlations of cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872] (CSF) and serum 
biomarkers with imaging and clinical measures of progressive disability, identification of unique phase 2 endpoints, and composite MRI scales (combining BPF, MTR, and DTI).   
Blood samples for analysis of ibudilast and its metabolite, 6,7- dihydrodiol (DHD) will be 
collected during scheduled visits on Weeks 8, 48, and 96. The exact sampling time and time 
relative to the previous dose will be documented in the case report forms. Population PK modeling using the NONMEM program (Icon Development Solution) will be used to characterize the pharmacokinetic properties of ibudilast in healthy subjects and subjects with MS. The population analysis will evaluate selected covariates to determine if they contribute to differences in PK parameter estimates among individuals. The covariates will likely include 
demographic variables (age, gender, body weight, and race), creatinine clearance (as a marker of renal function), liver enzyme levels (as a marker of hepatic function ), blood chemistry variables, 
and relevant disease covariates at baseline, among others. Further, the effect of concomitant medications on the pharmacokinetics of ibudilast will also be assessed.

 6. OVERALL STUDY DESIGN AND PLAN: DESCRIPTION 
This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study 
designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and activity of ibudilast (MN -166) administ ered 
twice daily over a 96 week  period in subjects with primary or secondary progressive multiple 
sclerosis who are currently untreated with long- term MS disease modi fying therapy (DMT) or 
who are receiving either glatiramer acetate (GA) or interferon beta (IFNβ -1a [Avonex, Rebif ] or 
IFNβ -1b [Betaseron, Extavia ]) treatment.  Study drug will be administered as an adjunct to 
glatiramer or beta interferon treatment.  
A total of 250 male and female subjects from  21 to 65 years old , inclusive, are planned to be 
enrolled into one of two treatment  arms ( ibudilast 100 mg/d or matching- place bo).  
Randomization of subject s will be stratified by  [CONTACT_20984] (PPMS or SPMS), and  by 
[CONTACT_262125]: “untreated”, GA, or IFN .  Subjects will return to the clinic for 
follow -up visits on a regular basis at Week 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84 and 96 (se e Table 1 
Schedule of Assessments).    
After [ADDRESS_318730] 60 days, the Medical Safety Monitor (MSM) will review safety data 
provided by [CONTACT_36909].  Safety data will be segregated by [CONTACT_1570] (Group A, Group B), but the treatment assignment for each group (ibudilast, placebo) will not be 
identified. The MSM  will prepare a report of study safety based upon the 30-day and 60- day 
safety data.  A National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) Data and Safety 
Monitoring Board (DSMB) will meet to review the 30 -day and 60- day safety data report from  
the MSM . The DSMB will then meet every six months during the study (and more often, if 
deemed necessary), and will review segregated (but treatment group blinded) safety data 
including adverse events and serious adverse events (SAE).  One member of the DSMB will 
know the specific treatment group assignment. The membership of the DSMB and its mandates are described in the NeuroNEXT DSMB  Guideline.   
The NeuroNEXT Clinical Coordinating Center (CCC) located at the [LOCATION_005] General 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_261952]. The NeuroNEXT Data Coordinating Center (DCC) located at the University of Iowa will coordinate all data and statistical services for the study, as well as clinical monitoring for all sites.  
The study phases are described below and displayed in Figure 1. The schedule of assessments, is 
displayed  in Table 1 .  Table 2 displays the Schedule of Unplanned Procedures and Assessments. 
6.1. Screening Phase (up to 45 days)  
A total of up to [ADDRESS_318731] a confirmed diagnosis of SPMS or PPMS according to 2010 International 
Panel Criteria, typi[INVESTIGATOR_261953]’s MRI Criteria, and 
Protocol NN102 SPRINT -MS with Amendment 6.0                                               08 Aug 2017

 clinical evidence of disability progression in the preceding 2 years, as measured by [CONTACT_117162]: 
o worsening overall ED SS of at least 0.5 points (may be assessed retrospectively , but 
cannot be during a clinical relapse ) or  
o 20% worsening in 25-foot walk (25- FW) or  
o 20% worsening in 9-hole peg test (9-HPT) in either hand. 
The diagnosis must be noted in the source documents. 
6.1.2. Treatment Phase (96 weeks ) 
The double- blind Treatment Phase consists of a Baseline visit followed by [ADDRESS_318732] occur within 45 days following the Screening Visit.  At the 
Baseline Visit (Day 1), subjects who have completed all of the screening assessments and 
continue to meet eligibility criteria will be randomized to one of two treatment groups (MN -166 
100 mg/d or placebo) in a 1:[ADDRESS_318733] dose of study medication (30 mg MN-166 or placebo) on the 
evening of the Baseline Visit  (Day 1) .  On the morning of Day 2, a ll subjects will begin a 3 
capsule BID dosing regimen  through Day 14.  Subjects randomized to MN- 166 will start at 60 
mg/d (30 mg BID) on Day  2 and will rema in on 60 mg/d through Day 14 . Beginning on Day 15, 
all subjects will increase dosing to 5 capsules BID regimen ; those randomized to the MN-166 
treatment arm will be taking 100 mg/d .  
After Day 15, s ubjects with intolerable side -effects ( e.g., nausea, diarrhea, vertigo) may reduce 
their dose to either 4 capsules twice a day (80 mg/d for those taking ibudilast) or 3 capsules twice 
a day (60 mg/d for those taking ibudilast). Subject with intolerable side -effects ( e.g., nausea, 
diarrhea, vertigo) at the end of Day 14 may continue to taking 3 capsules twice a day at the 
Investigator’s discretion.  At the investigator’s discretion, the daily dose of ibudilast can be 
changed between [ADDRESS_318734] 8 weeks of treatment. At the investigator’s discretion , the daily dose of ibudilast may be 
divided and taken three times per day if needed to improve tolerability.  At the end of the first [ADDRESS_318735] maintain their then -current daily dose of study medication 
(6 capsules per day, 8 capsules per day, or 10 capsules per day). The dosing interval may be 
twice a day or 3 times per day, at the investigator’s discretion. The dosing interval may be 
changed between twice and three times per day over the course of the entire study, at the investigator’s discretion.  
Subjects will return to the clinic for follow -up visits on a regular basis at Week 4 , 8, 12, 24, 36,  
48, 60, 72, 84 and 96 (see Table 1: Schedule of Assessme nts).   
Subjects who experience symptoms suggestive of a possible relapse will return to the clinic 
within three days of notifying the Investigator and will undergo assessments described in Table 2 
Schedule of Unplanned Procedures and Assessments).  
 Subjects who prematurely discontinue study medication will be asked to continue to be followed 
off study medication on a semi -annual basis (Table 2: Schedule of Unplanned Procedures and 
Protocol NN102 SPRINT -MS with Amendment 6.0                                               08 Aug 2017

Note:  Active medical conditions th at are minor or well -controlled are not exclusionary 
if, in the judgment of the Investigator, they do not affect risk to the subject or the study 
results. In cases in which the impact of the condition upon risk to the subject or study

Protocol NN102 SPRINT -MS with Amendment 6.[ADDRESS_318747] Withdrawal/Discontinuation Criteria  
Subjects may request to be withdrawn from the study at any time for any reason.  
The Investigator may interrupt the treatment of any subject whose health or well-being may be 
compromised by [CONTACT_94597].  The following instances may require subjects to be 
withdrawn from the study: 
 Subject fails to adequately comply with the dosing, evaluations, or other requirements of the study  at the discretion of Investigator ; 
 Subjects who have adverse events that require discontinuation of study medication; 
 Subjects who, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], should be discontinued for their well-being;  
 Subjects who are no longer able to understand task instructions or to perform tests adequately ; 
 Subject becomes pregnant during the study. See section 11.8 for reporting requirements 
and follow-up of the pregnancy; 
 Any Grade 3 or higher CTCAE; 
 Abnormal laboratory values as described in section 8.6.2.   
If a subject withdraws or is removed from the study for any reason, the reason and date of 
discontinuation of study medication should be recorded in the appropriate section of the Case 
Report Form (CRF).  At the time of study discontinuation, every effort should be made to ensure 
all Early Withdrawal (EW) procedures and evaluations are performed .  
The study sponsors reserve the right to discontinue the study at any time for medical or administrative reasons.    
Study drug re-administration may be considered as noted below.  
7.3.1. Follow -up Procedures Upon Discontinuation/Withdrawal  
If a subject discontinues study medication for any reason , the subject will be encouraged to 
continue to be followed within the study, but on a reduced study visit schedule . Depending upon 
when the subject discontinued study drug, the reduced study visit schedule will include study 
visits at Week 24, 48, 72, and 96. The timing of all study visits will remain relative to the 
original baseline date.  For subjects who discontinue study drug between regularly scheduled study visits, the subject should complete the next regularly scheduled study visit after study drug 
discontinuation , and then shift to the reduced study visit schedule. For subjects who discontinue 
study drug at a regularly scheduled study visit, the subject should shift immediately to the 
reduced study visit schedule . For subjects discontinuing study drug but remaining in the study 
for follow -up, s tudy visits will occur on a n approximate semi -annual basis until Week 96. Table 
[ADDRESS_318748] discontinues/withdraws prior to study completion and does not wish  to continue 
follow -up within the study (i.e. return for semi -annual visits), then all assessments scheduled for 
the Early Withdrawal visit ( Table 2 ) should be performed at the time of study discontinuation.  
A termination CRF page should be completed for every subject who received study medication 
whether or not the subject completed the study. The reason for discontinuation should be 
indicated on the CRF. Any AEs that are present at the time of discontinuation/ withdrawal 
should be followed in accordance with the safety requirements outlined in S ection 11.  
For all subjects  who complete the study on study medication , a follow-up visit (Week 100) will 
be conducted [ADDRESS_318749] visit to assess general health  and advers e event status .

 8. TREATMENT OF SUBJECTS 
8.1. Description of Study Drug  
MN-166 and matching-placebo will be provided in bottles containing MN-166 10 mg capsules or 
matching-placebo capsules, and will be stored at room temperature.  
8.2. Concomitant Medications  
Subjects may continue the use of IFN-β or glatiramer acetate while participating in this study.  
During the study, subjects may be allowed to change medications from one injectable to the other.  Peg ylated interferon beta-1 will be allowed (if approved by [CONTACT_1622]). 
Inhaled and topi[INVESTIGATOR_14271].  
If a relapse epi[INVESTIGATOR_254788], a single course of systemic corticosteroids is permitted , as prescribed 
by [CONTACT_38296]. 
8.3. Prohibited Medications  
The following medications are prohibited prior to and during study participation: 
• Systemic corticosteroid treatment within 3 months prior to screening (inhaled or topi[INVESTIGATOR_56785]).   
o  A single course of systemic corticosteroid treatment will b e allowed for treatment 
of a clinical relapse  
• Current use of intermittent systemic corticosteroids ( i.e., monthly or bimonthly 
intravenous methylprednisolone) 
• Oral immunosuppressants ( e.g., azathioprine, methotrexate, cyclosporine, teriflunomide 
[Aubagio
®]) within 6 months of screening 
• Mitoxantrone or natalizumab within 6 months of screening 
• Fingolimod or dimethyl fumarate [Tecfidera®] within 3 months of screening 
• Rituximab or other B-cell therapy within12 months of screening 
• Current use of other MS disease-modifying therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (DMTs) besides glatiramer acetate and IFNβ -1 (any formulation). 
 
The following medications are prohibited during study participation: 
• cimetidine, cyclosporine, dronedarone, lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054], probenecid, quinidine (including Neudexta), ranolazine, rifampin, ritonavir, or tipranavir 
8.4. Treatment Complianc e 
Compliance will be monitored closely at each visit. Subjects will be instructed to bring all 
unused study medication with them to each visit for drug accounta bility . Compliance will be 
assessed at weeks 24, 72, and 96 by [CONTACT_262129] s and dividing the actual number of doses 
taken (per capsule  count) by [CONTACT_262130] . All subjects will be 
reminded of the importance of strict compliance with taking study medication for the 
effectiveness of treatment and for the successful outcome of the study. Subjects who miss more 
than 25% of scheduled doses or take more than 125% of the scheduled doses will be considered noncompliant and may be discontinued from the study per investigator’s judgment.    
Protocol NN102 SPRINT -MS with Amendment 6.[ADDRESS_318750] of a screening phase (up to 45 days), followed by a double-blind treatment 
phase (96 weeks) and a follow-up visit (4 weeks after the 96 week visit).  Following the 
screeni ng phase, subjects who continue to meet entry criteria will be randomly assigned to one of 
two treatment groups: MN-166 100 mg/d  or matching placebo.  A total of 250 subjects, aged 21 
to 65 years, will be enrolled and randomized into one of two treatment groups (MN -166 vs. 
placebo) in a 1:1 ratio.  Randomization of subjects will be stratified by [CONTACT_262131] (IFN/GA vs. no DMT), and disease status (PPMS vs. SPMS).  The NeuroNEXT DCC will generate a randomization table for each of the strata using a permuted block design with random block sizes. 
8.6. Dosing Guidelines  
8.6.1. Treatment Phase  
Capsules containing either MN-166 (10 mg capsules) or matching-placebo will be used. At the Baseline Visit (Day 1), subjects will be instructed to take [ADDRESS_318751] 14 days and 5 capsules twice a day thereafter (or as directed by [CONTACT_10670])  once in the morning (e.g., between approximately 6 -9 AM ) and once in 
the evening (e.g., approximately 12 h later, which would be approximately 6-9 PM ), by [CONTACT_1966]. 
The investigator may also choose to administer the total daily dose of study medication on a three -times a day regimen to help reduce side effects.  
If a subject forgets to take their AM or PM study drug dose at the assigned time  (between 6 -9 
AM and PM) , subjects will be allowed to take their medication up to 12 PM or 12 AM, 
respectively .  Beyond this time, subjects will be instructed to skip the dose and take the next dose 
at their regularly scheduled time.  
 
 8.6.2   Dosing Inter ruption for Abnormal Labor atory Values  
Laboratory tests should be repeated within two weeks after any of the following laboratory 
values are met:  
• AST or ALT  or ALP or T.bil  > 3x upper limit of normal  (ULN)  
• GGT > [ADDRESS_318752]  
• Creatinine > 1.[ADDRESS_318753] 
• White blood cell count < 2500/mm3 
• Platelet count < 75,000/ mm3 
If after repeat testing the laboratory value is still outside the above limits, then the subject should 
stop study medication. While dosing is withheld, subjects will continue tests and assessments according to the schedule defined in the protocol (and may also undergo additional assessments 
to evaluate the laboratory abnormality as per the Investigator’s standard practice). In addition, 
Protocol NN102 SPRINT -MS with Amendment 6.[ADDRESS_318754] every 2 weeks (rechecks  
will be run at the central laboratory) until resolution or stabilization of the laboratory value.  
After laboratory values return within normal limits, resumption of blinded study treatment is to 
be considered on a case by [CONTACT_262132].  
 
8.6.[ADDRESS_318755] permanently discontinue dosing with study treatment (i.e., only one dosing interrupt ion is 
allowed for the same lab abnormalit y). However, subjects who subsequently experience a 
different laboratory abnormality can have study treatment withheld again for  a different 
laboratory abnormality. However, only two dosing interruption s are allowed for each subject. 
Any subject who experience s a third abnormal laboratory tests as defined in Section 8.6.[ADDRESS_318756] is required to provide written informed consent prior to undergoing any study 
procedures. A copy of the signed and dated informed consent (in a language in which the subject 
is fluent) is required to be given to the subject. If a subject withdraws consent, data collected up 
to the time of discontinuation will be used to evaluate study results.  
During the consent process, s ubjects will be informed that there is an FDA -approved treatment 
option available (i.e., mitoxantrone) for secondary progressive multiple sclerosis.

8.8.2. Procedures/Assessment Details  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Informed Consent  
The Clinical Study Site Principal Investigator ( CSSPI) or a qualified designee ( e.g., a licensed, 
qualified medical practitioner such as a physician’s assistant or a nurse practitioner) listed on 
Form FDA [ADDRESS_318761]’s questions, and 
obtain written informed consent before performing any study- related procedure. Informed 
Consent should be conducted in accordance with local requirements. Subjects should be able to 
verbally describe the benefits and risks associated with this study and what other treatment 
alternatives are available (as described in the consent form). Only subjects who provide informed 
consent, as assessed and documented by [CONTACT_737], will be  enrolled . 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Medical History   
A medical history  including history of multiple sclerosis  will be obtained by [CONTACT_262137] [INVESTIGATOR_261957] 1572. If the subject’s historical MS care was 
provided at another institution or location, efforts must be made to obtain these outside records to 
verify that the subject meets all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria. This must be 
accomplished during the screening period  and added to the subject’s medical record .  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Prior/Concomitant Medication Review  
Site study staff will record all medications used to treat multiple sclerosis  taken within 1 month 
prior to screening visit in the CRF . Also, the following parameters will be recorded for all 
concomitant medications: drug name, route of administration, total daily dose, unit, frequency, start/stop dates, indication, and whether the medication was started after last dose of study 
medication .  The concomitant medications will subsequently be coded using the World Health 
Organization Drug Dictionary (WHO- DD).   
[IP_ADDRESS]. Relapse Assessment  
Relapse Definition  
A protocol -defined clinical relapse is defined as new or recurrent neurological symptoms, not 
associated with fever  or infection , lasting for at least [ADDRESS_318762] 30 days of stability or improvement. In addition, a protocol- defined clinical relapse requires 
an increase in the EDSS Functional System corresponding to symptom(s) of the relapse, or an 
increase in the overall EDSS secondary to a functional change related to symptom(s) of the relapse. Because relapse is an expected event in patients with MS, a relapse epi[INVESTIGATOR_261958].  
 
Protocol NN102 SPRINT -MS with Amendment 6.0                                               08 Aug 2017  
   
Page 67 of 128 
 Relapse Treatmen t 
Clini cal relapses that meet the above definition may be treated with a course of corticosteroids at 
the investigator’s direction. MRI studies must be postponed until 1 month after completion of 
any systemic (excludes topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], inhaled) corticosteroid treatment.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Physical Examination  
The physical exams must be performed by [CONTACT_262137] [INVESTIGATOR_261959] (physician, 
physician’s assistant or nurse practitioner) listed on the Form FDA  1572. Clinically significant 
changes from the signing of the informed consent form  (ICF) should be captured as AEs in the 
CRF . 
A complete physical examination includes the following assessments: general appearance, head, 
eyes, ears/nose/throat, neck, lymph nodes, skin, lungs, heart, abdomen, and musculoskeletal. If 
the subject is discontinued for any reason, every attempt should be made to perform a final 
physical examination.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Vital Signs, Height, and Weight  
Blood pressure (BP) , heart rate  (HR)  measurements will be taken. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_261960]. Clinically 
signif icant changes from the signing of the ICF should be captured as AEs in the CRF . 
Weight will be measured in pounds or kilograms. Height will be recorded only at Visit 1 (screening).  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Electrocardiogram (12- Lead ECG)  
All subjects will have standard resting 12- lead ECGs performed and interpreted . A central 
facility will be used in this study for interpretation and analysis of ECGs. Subjects are to be 
supi[INVESTIGATOR_1919] 5 minutes prior to ECG asses sments.  The time the ECG is performed will be 
recorded (using a 24-hour  clock).  
The CSSPI [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a qualified designee listed on Form Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) [ADDRESS_318763]’s study chart. If a 
CSSPI [INVESTIGATOR_261961], initialed and dated the original ECG tracing and the results on the tracing match those on the report, the report will be considered  as reviewed and signed by [CONTACT_262137].  If 
the results vary, the CSSPI [INVESTIGATOR_261962], sign and date the report.  Results will be captured in the subject’s study chart, not in the CRF . Clinically significant findings from the screening 
report must be capt ured in the medical history.  Any clinically significant changes compared 
with screening must be captured as an AE in the CRF . 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Interval History  
During each visit, adverse events and concomitant medications will be documented.  For s ubjects 
who discontinue study medication and are followed on a semi -annual basis , adverse events that 
occur post -study drug discontinuation will not be collected.   Only those adverse events that 
Protocol NN102 SPRINT -MS with Amendment 6.[ADDRESS_318764] been completed . 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)  
Brain MRI will be performed in a standard fashion, as outlined in the MRI procedure manual.  
Each subject’s baseline MRI must be approved by [CONTACT_262138] r prior to 
randomization.   
Brain MRIs will be read  clinically for non -MS pathology by a board -certified neuroradiologist, 
with a report entered into the study database within  ten days and reported back to the treating 
neurologist through standard clinical results reporting methods. Urgent findings identified on 
brain MRI will be reported to the treating neurologist immediately at the discretion of the reading neuroradiologist. 
At any time during the study, s ubjects who received unscheduled corticosteroid t reatment must 
postpone their MRI until [ADDRESS_318765] (or “dummy”) MRI scan prior to study initiation. This test MRI will 
ensure adequate performance of the study MRI.  
It is required  that the same MRI scanner be used to acquire all MRI scans over the course of the 
study. If during the study period a study site needs to change the MRI scanner or the current MRI 
scanner undergoes significant upgrades (hardware or software), the investigator should notify the Clinical Coordinating Center. For all changes in scanner and significant scanner upgrades, the investigator will be requested to obtain MRI scans of 4 volunteers acquired prior to changing/upgrading the MRI scanner and the same 4 vol unteers again after changing scanners (a 
total of 8 scans). The site will be allowed to acquire ibudilast trial subject scans on the new scanner only after obtaining approval of the new or upgraded scanner. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) 
OCT is a non -invasive imaging technique used to obtain high resolution cross- sectional images 
of the retina. OCT measures the thickness of the ten layers in the retina.   
[IP_ADDRESS]. Lumbar Puncture (LP)  
An optional lumbar puncture for the collection of cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_261963] p erformed  in 
subjects who consent for LP.  If LP is performed, it must be performed after the MRI is done and 
cannot be performed prior to MRI. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Event (AE) Monitoring  
The CSSPI [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a qualified designee listed on Form FDA [ADDRESS_318766] assess the severity and 
relationship to study medication for all AEs (see Section  11.3).  
All observed or volunteered AEs regardless of treatment group or suspected causal relationship 
to the investigational product(s) will be recorded on the AE page(s) of the CRF.  
Each CSSPI  [INVESTIGATOR_261964].  
Protocol NN102 SPRINT -MS with Amendment 6.[ADDRESS_318767] pursue and obtain information adequate to determine the 
outcome of the AE and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as an SAE (see 
Section  11.3) requiring immediate notification to the Sponsor or its designa ted representative.  
For all AEs, sufficient information should be obtained by [CONTACT_118555]. The Investigator is required to assess causality and indicate that assessment 
on the CRF. For AEs with a causal relationship to the investigational product, follow -up by [CONTACT_262139] a level acceptable to the Investigator, and Sponsor concurs with that assessment.  
Adverse events (serious and non- serious)  including all suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions (S[LOCATION_003]R s) should be recorded on the CRF from the date of informed consent until the 
end of their participation in the study ( i.e., the subject has discontinued or completed the follow-
up visit).  
The DCC will prepare aggregate reports of all adverse events (serious/not serious, 
expected/unexpected and relationship to study drug) for the Independent Medical Monitor 
(IMM) on a quarterly basis and the DSMB on a semi-annual basis, or as requested  by [CONTACT_262140] . In addition, all adverse events will be coded 
using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Affairs ( MedDRA ) system. A separate report 
detailing protocol compliance will also be available from the DCC for DSMB as requested.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Laboratory Evaluations 
Laboratory evaluations will include the tests listed in  Appendix 1. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Instruments and Rating Scales 
For subjects who do not speak English with sufficient fluency to complete English versions of the Instruments and Rating Scales, a validated foreign language version will be utilized. Where an appropriate foreign language version is not available, the instrument or rating scale will be omitted.  
[IP_ADDRESS].1. Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) -short form  
The BPI -short form is designed for use in clinical trials to provide information on the intensity of 
pain as well as the degree to which pain interferes with function . The BPI [INVESTIGATOR_261965], pain quality, and the subject 's perception of the cause of pain. It takes 
approximately 5-10 minutes to complete.  
[IP_ADDRESS].2. Short Form -36 Health Survey  (SF-36) 
The SF -36 is a multipurpose short- form (SF) generic measure of health status.  The SF -36 
measures eight concepts commonly represented in widely us ed surveys: physical functioning, 
role limitations due to physical health problems , bodily pain, general health, vitality 
(energy/fatigue), social functioning, role limitations due to emotional problems and mental 
health (psychological distress and psychol ogical well-being).  The standard (4- week) recall 
version will be utilized.  
Protocol NN102 SPRINT -MS with Amendment 6.0                                               08 Aug 2017

 [IP_ADDRESS].3. Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale -29 (MSIS-29) 
The MSIS -29 is an instrument measuring the physical (20 questions) and psychological (9 
questions) impact of multiple sclerosis.  
[IP_ADDRESS].4. Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC)  
The MSFC was originally defined as  a three -part, standardized, quantitative assessment 
instrument for use in clinical trials. The three original components measure leg 
function/ambulation  through 25- foot-walk test (25 FW) , arm/hand function through 9-hole peg 
test (9 -HPT) , and cognitive function through Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test.  
Contemporary revisions to the MSFC have added a visual component (a low -contrast visual 
acuity test) and replaced the Paced Aud itory Serial Addition Test with the Symbol Digit 
Modality Test (SDMT). This trial’s implementation of the MSFC will utilize this four -
component version: [ADDRESS_318768] Sensitivity (2.5% chart). The 
MSFC measures will be administered b y a trained and certified examiner and takes 
approximately 20 to 30 minutes to complete. 
[IP_ADDRESS].5. Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)  
The Kurtzke EDSS is a rating system used to quantify disability in subjects with multiple 
sclerosis and monitor changes in the level of disability over time. The EDSS scale ranges from [ADDRESS_318769] symptoms and adverse events. 
[IP_ADDRESS].6. EuroQol 5- Dimension (EQ -5D) 
The EQ -5D is a standardized instrument for use as a measure of health outcome (mobility, self -
care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression). It is designed for self -completion 
by [CONTACT_262141] a few minutes to complete. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS].7. Beck Depression Inventory -Fast Screen (BDI -FS)

[IP_ADDRESS].9. Symbol Digit Modalities Test  (SDMT)  
The Symbol -Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) is a five minute test that quickly assesses  the 
participant for cerebral dysfunction using a simple substitution task. It is easy to administer and 
remarkably accurate when it comes to detecting the presence of brain damage and other changes 
in a patient’s cognitive functioning. It is effective because those with cerebral dysfunction will

• Inflammatory disease ac tivity, as measured by T1 lesion volume, T2 lesion volume, and 
annualized relapse rate  
• Disability, as measured by [CONTACT_262101] (EDSS) and Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC)  
• Quality of Life, as measured by [CONTACT_262144] (MSIS -29), EuroQol 5 
Dimensions (EQ-5D), and Short Form- 36 Health Survey (SF -36) 
• Cognitive impairment, as measured by [CONTACT_262145]  
• Neuropathic pain, as measured by [CONTACT_262088] (BPI). 
10.2. Tertiary Endpoints  
1. The first set of tertiary objectives are to evaluate the activity of ibudilast (MN -166) at 48 
weeks versus placebo as measured by [CONTACT_262089]: 
whole brain atrophy (BPF), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in descending pyramidal white 
matter tracts, magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) imaging in normal -appearing brain tissue, and 
retinal nerve fiber layer as measured by [CONTACT_262121] (OCT) , and c ortical 
atrophy as measured by [CONTACT_262146] . 
2. The second set of tertiary objectives are to evaluate the activity of ibudilast (MN -166) at 96 
weeks versus placebo as measured  by [CONTACT_28760] -brain gray matter fraction, new T1 lesions since 
baseline, and new T2 lesions since baseline. 
 
10.3. Exploratory Endpoints  
The exploratory endpoints at selected  sites include analysis of  the pharmacokinetics (PK) of 
ibudilast (MN -166) using a population PK approach, potential pharmacokinetic -
pharmacodynamic analyses, and the correlation of cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872] (CSF) and serum 
biom arkers – e.g., neurofilament light chain measurement and correlation analysis with imaging 
metrics .   
Protocol NN102 SPRINT -MS with Amendment 6.[ADDRESS_318776] and its metabolite, 6,7- dihydrodiol (DHD) will be 
collected during scheduled visits on Weeks 8, 48, and 96. The ex act sampling time and time 
relative to the previous dose will be documented in the case report forms. Population PK 
modeling using the NONMEM program (Icon Development Solution) will be used to characterize the pharmacokinetic properties of ibudilast in he althy subjects and subjects with 
MS. The population analysis will evaluate selected covariates to determine if they contribute to differences in PK parameter estimates among individuals. The covariates will likely include demographic variables (age, gender , body weight, and race), creatinine clearance (as a marker of 
renal function), liver enzyme levels (as a marker of hepatic function), blood chemistry variables, and relevant disease covariates at baseline, among others. Further, the effect of concomitant medications on the pharmacokinetics of ibudilast will also be assessed.

 11. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
11.1. Primary Safety Parameters  
Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_262147]: 
• treatment emergent adverse events ( TEAEs)  
• treatment emergent serious adverse events ( TESAEs)  
Safety  (relationship and severity)  and tolerability will further be assessed by [CONTACT_262148], laboratory va lues, ECGs, physi cal examinations, vital signs and weight.  
During the study, if ≥ [ADDRESS_318777] may continue on study drug.   
11.2. Definition of Adverse Events  
An adverse event ( AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a study subject who was 
administered a medicinal (investigational) product and which does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not considered 
related to the medicinal (investigational) prod uct. Adverse events may include the onset of a new 
illness and the exacerbation of pre- existing conditions.  
Other untoward events occurring in the framework of a clinical study are also to be recorded as AEs, ( e.g., those occurring during treatment- free pe riods, including screening or post- treatment 
follow -up periods), in association with study-related procedures and assessments or under 
placebo.  
11.3. Assessment of Adverse Events 
The CSSPI  [INVESTIGATOR_261967], relationshi p with study 
medication, and whether it meets the criteria for classification as a SAE, requiring immediate 
notification to the Sponsor or designee (se e Section  11.6). These assessments will be made in 
accordance with the standard ratings detailed in the following sections.  
Each CSSPI  [INVESTIGATOR_261968]  (AERS) .  
 
11.3.1. Severity Assessment  
The severity of AEs will be determined as described below. 
 
Protocol NN102 SPRINT -MS with Amendment 6.[ADDRESS_318778]’s daily 
activities. Treatment is not ordinarily indicated.  
Moderate  
Grade [ADDRESS_318779]’s daily activities. Treatment may be necessary.  
Severe 
Grade [ADDRESS_318780]’s daily 
activities. May be unable to continue in the study and treatment may be necessary. 
Life-
threatening  
Grade 4  Extreme limitation in activity, significant assistance required; significant and urgent 
medical/therapy intervention required hospi [INVESTIGATOR_114956].  
Death  
Grade 5  Death  related to AE.  
 
When changes in the intensity of an AE occur more frequently than once a day, the maximum 
intensity for the event should be noted for that day. Any change in grade of severity of signs and symptoms over a number of days will be captured by [CONTACT_44745] a new AE, with the amended severity grade and the date (and time, if known) of the change. 
11.3.2. Relationship to Study Drug  
One of the following categories in Table [ADDRESS_318781] abnormality, occurs in a 
plausible time relationship to treatment administration, and which 
cannot be explained by [CONTACT_262149]. The response to withdrawal of the treatment (dechallengea) 
should be clinically plausible. The event must be definitive pharmacologically or phenomenologically, using a satisfactory 
rechallenge
b procedure if necessary.  
Probably 
related  
 A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, occurs within a 
reasonable time sequence to administration of the treatment, unlikely to 
be attributed to concurrent disease or other medications or chemicals, 
and which follows a cl inically reasonable response on withdrawal 
(dechallenge). Rechallenge information is not required to fulfill this definition.  
Possibly related  
 A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, occurs within a 
reasonable time sequence to administration of the treatment, but which 
could also be explained by [CONTACT_262150]. Information on treatment withdrawal may be lacking or 
unclear. 
Unlikely to be related  
 A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, occurs with a 
temporal relationship to treatment administration that makes a causal 
Protocol NN102 SPRINT -MS with Amendment 6.[ADDRESS_318782] negative dechallenge and rechallenge information. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_261969] ( e.g., concomitant disease, 
environmental fac tors, or other medications or chemicals).  
a Dechallenge is when a medication suspected of causing an AE is discontinued. If the symptoms of the AE 
disappear partially or completely, within a reasonable time from medication discontinuation, this is termed a 
positive dechallenge. If the symptoms conti nue despi[INVESTIGATOR_261970], this is termed a negative 
dechallenge. Note that there are exceptions when an AE does not disappear upon discontinuation of the 
medication, yet medication -relatedness clearly exists ( e.g., as in bone marrow suppression, fixed medication 
eruptions, or tardive dyskinesia)  
b Rechallenge is when a medication suspected of causing an AE in a specific subject in the past is readministered to 
that subject. If the AE recurs upon exposure, this is termed a positive rechallenge. If the AE does not recur, this is 
termed a negative rechallenge. 
As this is a double-blind study, the causality assessment should be made under the assumption 
that the subject is receiv ing active study medication. If considering unblinding, this assessment 
should be made prior to unblinding to avoid bias. 
11.4. Recording Adverse Events  
Adverse events should be collected and recorded for each subject from the date the informed consent form (ICF ) was signed until the end of their participation in the study, (i.e., the subject 
has discontinued or completed the study) through the follow- up visit  with the exception of those 
subjects who discontinue study medication during the study and are followed on a semi -annual 
basis . Subjects who discontinue study medication but continue follow- up within the study will 
not have AEs collected after study drug discontinuation . Only those AEs that occurred while on 
study drug that have not been resolved will be fol lowed until resolution or stabilization.  
Following the end of the subject’s participation in the study, the CSSPI [INVESTIGATOR_261971] “spontaneously” if considered at least possibly related to study medication.  
Adverse events may b e volunteered spontaneously by [CONTACT_1177], or discovered by [CONTACT_119560], non-leading question such as, “How have you been feeling since you were last asked?” All AEs and any required remedial action will be recorded in the subject’s source documentation and transcribed onto the 
appropriate CRF  page for the study period indicated. The nature of AE, date (and time, if known) 
of AE onset, date (and time, if known) of AE outcome to date, severity, and action taken of the AE will be documented together with the CSSPIs or an authorized physician’s assessment of the 
seriousness of the AE and causal relationship to study medication and/or study procedure (at the 
time of assessment).  
All AEs should be recor ded individually in the study subject’s own words (verbatim) unless, in 
the opi[INVESTIGATOR_261972], the AEs constitute components of a recognized condition, disease, or syndrome. In the latter case, the condition, disease, or syndrome should be named rather than each individual symptom. The AEs will subsequently be coded using the MedDRA.  
Protocol NN102 SPRINT -MS with Amendment 6.[ADDRESS_318783]’s source documentation and transcribed onto the appropriate CRF  page.  
All SAEs will be followed until resolution, stabilization of the condition, the event is otherwise explained, or the subject is lost to follow -up. 
11.6. Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)  
An AE is considered serious if it meets one or more of the following criteria:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threaten ing (i.e., a subject is at immediate risk of death at the time of the event, 
not an event where occurrence in a more severe form might have caused death)  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Results in  a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
• Is another important medical event (see below) ? 
Important medical events that do not result in death, are not life -threatening, or do not require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_37347], based on appropriate medical judgment, they 
may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or in a physician ’s office, blood dyscrasias 
or seizures that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. A distinction should be drawn between serious and severe AEs. 
Severity is a measure of intensity whereas seriousness is defined by [CONTACT_29967]. For 
example, a mild degree of gastrointestinal bleeding requiring an overnight hospi[INVESTIGATOR_261973], but is not nece ssarily severe. Similarly, an 
AE that is severe in intensity is not necessarily an SAE. For example, alopecia may be assessed as severe in intensity, but would probably not be considered an SAE. 
11.6.1. SAE Reporting Requirements  
The CSSPI [INVESTIGATOR_261974] e is responsible for submitting  the requested information via 
the DCC Online Adverse Event Reporting System  within [ADDRESS_318784]’ s participation in the study, the CSSPI [INVESTIGATOR_261975] “spontaneously” if considered at least possibly related to study medication.  Upon entry of a serious adverse event by a CSSPI , the DCC Online Adverse 
Event Reporting System will immediately notify the Medical Safety Monitor (M SM).   
• Within 24 hours  (of learning of the event), investigators must report any Serious Adverse 
Event s (SAE s). Investigators must report all other AEs within 5 working days/7 calendar 
days  (of learning of the event).  
Protocol NN102 SPRINT -MS with Amendment 6.0                                               08 Aug 2017

 Serious adverse events : The CSSPI  [INVESTIGATOR_261976] ( related, probably related, possibly 
related, unlikely to be related, and unrelated) of the adverse event. The IMM will review the 
SAE report.  The IMM may request further information if necessary.  The Online Adverse Event Report ing System maintains audit trails and stores data (and data updated) and communication 
related to any adverse event in the study.  The IMM may determine that the Serious Adverse Event requires expedited reporting to the Sponsor and FDA  (Food and Drug Administration) .  
The DCC will prepare a Medwatch safety report for submission to the FDA.  If warranted, the 
IMM will notify the DSMB chair.  The DSMB may suggest changes to the protocol or consent 
form to the Study Chair as a consequence of adverse events.  
As a minimum requirement, the initial notification will provide the following information: 
• Subject ID number 
• Date of SAE onset  
• An event term  
• Details of SAE  (if sufficient information is available)  
• Criterion/criteria for classification as “serious”  
• Causality  assessment (if sufficient information is available to make this 
classification).  
Initial reports of SAEs must be followed later with detailed descriptions, including clear photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_211387] (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_73529], consultant reports, autopsy 
reports, etc.), with the study subject’s personal identifiers removed. All relevant information 
obtained by [CONTACT_262137] [INVESTIGATOR_261977] a follow -up SAE  CRF  page via the DCC Online Adverse Event Reporting System.  
The Independent Medical Monitor  may also request additional information on the SAE.  
Non-serious adverse events : Non -serious adverse events that are reported to or observed by [CONTACT_92685] a member of his research team will be submitted to the DCC in a timely fashion 
(within 5 working days). The events will be presented in tabular form and given to the IMM on a 
quarterly basis or as requested. Local site investigators are also requir ed to fulfill all reporting 
requirements of their local institutions.  
The DCC will prepare aggregate reports of all adverse events (serious/not serious, expected/unexpected and relationship to study drug) for the IMM on a quarterly basis and the DSMB on a semi -annual basis, or as requested  by [CONTACT_262151] . In addition, all 
adverse events will be coded using the MedDRA system. A separate report detailing protocol compliance will also be available from the DCC for DSMB review monthly or as requested .  
Any AE fulfilling the criteria for expedited reporting will be reported by [CONTACT_262152] , respectively,  in accordance with the 
NeuroNEXT Network and company’s standard operating procedures (SOPs) and local regulatory 
requirements.  
Clinical Study Site Principal Investigators are responsible for complying with NeuroNEXT 
Central Institutional Review Board’s ( CIRB) reporting requirements for all safety reports .  
Protocol NN102 SPRINT -MS with Amendment 6.0                                               08 Aug 2017

 Copi[INVESTIGATOR_261978]’s study file. Emergency Procedures  
If the CSSPI [INVESTIGATOR_261979],  an “on call” Independent Medical Safety Monitor (s) will be  available 
24 hours a day by [CONTACT_756]/pager.  A neurologist experienced with MS trials and 
pharmacotherapy trial medical monitoring, independent of MediciNova or NINDS/NeuroNEXT or CCF, will be the primary medical safety monitor.   
11.6.2. Emergency Treatment Code- Break  
In the case of a medical emergency, where knowledge of study treatment by [CONTACT_262137] [INVESTIGATOR_261980], the CSSPI [INVESTIGATOR_261981].  
A 24-hour code- break service will be available via the DCC . 
All treatment code breaks must be fully documented and signed with the time, date, reason, and 
name [CONTACT_262234]. The 
breaking of the blind must result in the withdrawal of the subject, and the subject should return for a final study assessment.  
11.7. Guidance for Overdose  
There is no clinical experience with MN -166/AV411overdose in humans and there is no 
available specific antidote to the effects of MN -166/AV411. Standard symptomatic support 
measures should be used in the case of excessive pharmacological effects or overdose.  
11.8.  Reporting and Follow -up of Pregnancies 
If any study subject or subject’s partner becomes pregnant after receiving the first dose of study 
medication ( MN-166 or placebo) and until the follow-up period specified in the protocol, the 
CSSPI [INVESTIGATOR_261982] a Pregnancy Report Form to the DCC database 
within [ADDRESS_318785] becoming aware of the pregnancy.  
If a pregnancy is to be terminated, the anticipated date of termination should also be provided in 
the “Additional Information/Comments” f ield of the Pregnancy Report Form. If a maternal SAE 
is reported for the study subject during the initial notification of pregnancy, a separate SAE Report Form should also be completed and submitted via the DCC Online Adverse Event 
Reporting System within [ADDRESS_318786]’s pregnancy 
with the doctor medically responsible for the pregnancy. A new Pregnancy Report Form should 
be submitted via the DCC electronic data capture system  within [ADDRESS_318787] becoming aware of any new information.  
If additional information on the outcome of the pregnancy and/or the details of the birth/delivery is received “spontaneously” by [CONTACT_3452], the CSSPI [INVESTIGATOR_261983] a Pregnancy Report Form within 24 hours of becoming aware of the information. If the 
outcome of the pregnancy is reported as premature birth, or as elective termination due to a medical reason or as spontaneous or accidental miscarriage, the details o f the outcome should be 
described in the “Additional Information/Comments” field of the Pregnancy Report Form. The pregnancy outcome will generally be reported as a follow-up report.  
Complete an SAE Report Form if the delivery outcome meets the criteria f or a SAE ( e.g., 
congenital anomaly/birth defect, stillbirth, some other sickness, etc.). The SAE Report Form 
should be completed with the study subject’s details (e.g., subject number, initials, date of birth, 
investigational product information, etc.) and  the details of the fetal SAE and maternal 
complications should be described in the “Narrative” field of the SAE Report Form.  
If a pregnancy is reported for the study subject’s partner, the Sponsor’s representative will provide instructions on how to colle ct pregnancy information in accordance with local 
requirements. 
11.9. Preplanned Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_261984], if a subject has a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29918] (e.g., elective surgery) that was scheduled prior to the subject entering the study (i.e., before the subject signed the ICF) for an event/condition that occurred before the study, the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29919] a therapeutic 
intervention and not the result of an SAE. However, if the event/condition worsens during the 
study, it must be reported as an AE or SAE (if the event/condition results in a serious outcome such as prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].) 
11.10. Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) 
The monitoring of subject safety and data quality will follow the NINDS Guidelines for Data and  
Safety Monitoring in Clinical Trials.  A DSMB appointed by [CONTACT_18121] /NINDS will meet semi -
annually to review partially unblinded study data provided by [CONTACT_4305].  This 
committee will monitor rates of adverse events and endpoints in the trial and will monitor the 
performance of the trial. The format of DSMB meetings, reports, and guidelines for interim analysis will be agreed prior to study subject enrollment.

 12. STATISTICS  
The Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will provide comprehensive details on the statistical  methods 
planned for this study.  
12.1. Data Analysis 
12.1.1. Analysis Populations 
The modified Intent -to-Treat ( mITT) Population : The primary population for analysis is the 
mITT, which is defined as all subjects who are randomized and receive at least one dose of study 
medication  and have at least one efficacy assessment  in the double-blind phase. Subjects will be 
analyzed based on the treatment they are randomized.  
The Per Protocol (PP) Population:  The per- protocol population includes all mITT subjects 
who satisfy the following conditions:  
• Have 75% -125% compliance, both limit values inclusive in the double-blind phase, 
• Have no major protocol deviations, determined by a blinded data review.  
12.1.2. Statistical Analysis Plan  
All imaging endpoints will be sta tistically evaluated using linear mixed models (LMMs: Laird 
and Ware, 1982). LMMs are advantageous for longitudinal clinical trials because they can 
account for the dependency due to repeated measures with relatively few parameters, which potentially enhances statistical efficiency. Furthermore, LMMs can accommodate incomplete cases ( i.e., missing data), which is expected in this study due to dropout. LMMs are typi[INVESTIGATOR_261985] (Verbeke and Molenberghs, 2000) that yield va lid 
inferences with incomplete cases under the widely applicable assumption that the missing data are ignorable (Little and Rubin 2002). For all analyses, the residuals of the fitted statistical models will be examined for evidence of departure from assump tions, such as normality. If 
assumptions appear to be grossly violated, then transformations of response variables might be considered. Alternatively, generalized LMMs might be used because of their ability to accommodate a wider range of distributional fo rms ( e.g., beta distribution).  The primary 
analysis will be conducted using a modified intent- to-treat analysis, which includes all subjects 
who are randomized , receive at least one dose of study medication in the double-blind phase , and 
meet the conditio ns specified in 12.1.1.  Since this is a phase II proof of concept study, statistical 
significance will be determined by [CONTACT_262153] 0.10 significance level.  To account 
for baseline imbalance due to randomization vagaries, the baseline group means (intercepts) in the statistical analysis will be constrained to be equal.  
Primary Objective #1: To evaluate the activity of Ibudilast (MN -166 100 mg/d) versus 
placebo at two years, as measured by [CONTACT_262082] (MRI) analysis for whole brain atrophy using brain parenchymal function (BPF).  
The first primary objective of the proposed study is to evaluate the activ ity of ibudilast 
(treatment) versus placebo. For the first primary objective, the endpoint is the rate of change in brain parenchymal fraction (BPF) of the treatment group versus the placebo group. The 
evaluation of activity is defined as the test of the null hypothesis that the BPF rates of change in Commented [CCS1]: OPTIONAL – We removed this from the 
SAP, since this is repetitive with the second criteria in that you can’t 
have 75% -125% compliance without taking the study medication as 
randomized.  If others feel we don’t need to change this, I’m fine 
with that.  
Protocol NN102 SPRINT -MS with Amendment 6.0                                               08 Aug 2017  
   
Page 84 of 128 
 the treatment and placebo groups are equal. The null hypothesis can be evaluated based on 
parameter estimates in the LMM, the details of which are now presented.  
Suppose Yij is the BPF value for the ith patient ( i = 1, …, N ) at the jth month ( j = 1, …, n i), tij 
denotes time in week s, P stands for placebo, and T  stands for treatment. Assuming linear change 
over time, the LMM can be written as the following,  
𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖=  𝛼𝛼𝑃𝑃+𝛽𝛽𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖+�𝛾𝛾+𝛿𝛿𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖�𝑔𝑔𝑖𝑖+ (𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖+𝑏𝑏𝑖𝑖+𝜖𝜖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖)      (1)  
where gi is a dummy variable for group, 
𝑔𝑔𝑖𝑖=�0𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝑃𝑃,
1𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝑇𝑇. 
In Equation (1), αP, βP, γ, and δ are fixed effects; αP is the intercept for the placebo group, βP is 
the slope for the placebo group, γ  = αT − αP = 0 is the difference of the intercepts, and δ = βT − 
βP is the difference of the slopes. Setting γ  = 0 constrains the baseline means to be equal, which 
controls for initial imbalance that occurs in empi[INVESTIGATOR_261986] ( Senn, 2013). The terms ai 
and b i are random effects (random intercepts and slopes, respectively), and 𝜖𝜖 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is random error. 
We make the typi[INVESTIGATOR_261987]        
[𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖𝑏𝑏𝑖𝑖]𝑇𝑇~𝒩𝒩(𝟎𝟎,𝑮𝑮), 𝜖𝜖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖~𝒩𝒩(0,𝜎𝜎2𝑰𝑰𝑖𝑖), and [𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖𝑏𝑏𝑖𝑖]𝑇𝑇⊥ 𝜖𝜖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖. 
The prime object of inference is δ, as this is the index of longitudinal activity of T versus P, 
namely, the difference in rates of change. The null hypothesis of no longitudinal ibudilast effect 
(equality of T  and P  slopes) is H 0: δ = 0, and can be evaluated with the likelihood ratio test , or a 
Z-test, provided a sufficiently large sample size that is provided in the proposed study ( N = 250, 
see Sample Size Justification below). The Z statistic is 𝑍𝑍=𝛿𝛿̂𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆(𝛿𝛿̂)⁄  and leads to the rejection of 
H0 when |𝑍𝑍|>𝑍𝑍1−𝛼𝛼, with the latter value being th e 100⋅(1−𝛼𝛼)th quar tile of the standard 
normal distribution (single- tailed test).  
Longitudinal measurements will span up to five time points per participant ( Baseline and 24, 48, 
72, 96 weeks ), and there is a possibility that BFP trajectories will not be linear. In order to assess 
the sensitivity of the results to the assumption of linearity, n on-linear trends will be modeled with 
polynomials and compared to the fit of the linear trend model of Equation (1). If p olynomials of 
order greater than one are required, then the evaluation of T versus P involves parameters in 
addition to δ from Equation (1), for example, the difference in quadratic terms. In this case, an 
appropriate Wald test will be performed, which is the multiparameter extension of the Z -test. 
Interpretation of the results will be in terms of T versus P differences in instantaneous rate of 
change ( ie, the first derivative) at different time points.  
Accounting for multiple sites . The  proposed study involves multiple sites, which is a potential 
source of additional variation. Patients within a site tend to be correlated due to similarity of 
environment, eg, because of testing by [CONTACT_262154] (Localio  et al   2001). It is 
potentially important to account for the nesting of patients within sites in order to produce proper precision estimates ( ie, standard errors) for statistical testing. To account for site variation, the 
Equation (1) model may be augmented with additional ra ndom effects and associated variance 
components.  
Suppose that Y
hij is BPF for the jth score of the ith patient in the hth site ( h = 1, …, S). Then the 
LMM has the form in the left side of the table below. The right hand side of the table identifies 
the types of effects in each pi[INVESTIGATOR_261988].

If individual site variance components in H  are negligible, then the associated random effects 
will be omitted to simplify the model. In the case that all H components are negligible, we will 
revert to Equation (1) for the analysis.  
Primary Objective # 2: To evaluate the safety and tolerability of ibudilast versus placebo.  
The main assessment of safety will involve a comparison of treatment -related SAEs  across the 
two treatment groups.  This will be assessed in two ways.  First, the percentage of subjects who 
experience any treatment -related SAE in each group will be compared using a chi-square test.  
Then, the rates of treatment -related SAEs in each gro up will be compared using a Poisson 
regression model.  We will also assess the values of laboratory assessments over time across the two groups using a LMM.  To assess tolerability, the percentage of subjects who complete the entire treatment period will b e compared across the two groups using a chi- square test.  
Appropriate constraints for baseline imbalance will be used in all statistical models.

 Major Secondary Objective s: To evaluate the activity of ibudilast at two years versus placebo, 
as measured by : 
(1) Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in descending pyramidal white matter tracts 
(2) Magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) imaging in normal-appearing brain tissue 
(3) Retinal nerve fiber thickness as measured by o ptical coherence tomography (OCT) 
(4) Cortical atrophy as measured by [CONTACT_262084] 
(CLADA)   
The secondary objectives will be analyzed using a model similar to that described above for the assessment of BPF.  An exception is the OCT analysis will require add itional random effects for 
eyes nested within patients. Additional details are provided below. The baseline intercepts will again be constrained to be equal to account for baseline imbalance.  
Other Objectives  
The proposed study will provide a wealth of additional information.  Correspondingly, a number of additional exploratory hypotheses will be conducted.  For example, there is a great need to 
identify imaging metrics for measuring potential neuroprotective therapi[INVESTIGATOR_261989]. Usin g data collected simultaneously from the same patients over two years, we will 
directly compare different atrophy measures, MTR, DTI, and OCT for variability, sensitivity to change over time, cost, ease of implementation, and correlation with clinical disa bility measures, 
patient self -report, and CSF parameters. In addition, we will correlate imaging = changes in the 
initial 6 -12 months with clinical changes over 2 years. A multivariate version of the LMM will 
be used (Fieuws & Verbeke, 2004) to simultaneously model two response variables. This will allow the statistical comparison of the slopes, for example, of brain atrophy and a self- report 
measure to see if they are changing similarly over time. Through these analyses, we will attempt to make recommendat ions regarding the most robust and practical outcome for implementation 
in future Phase [ADDRESS_318789] advanced imaging metrics differently. The baseline intercepts in all the mo dels will 
again be constrained to be equal to account for baseline imbalance.  
Additional exploratory analyses will examine one year changes in the variables involved in the 
primary and secondary objectives above,a s well as  one or two year changes in a number of 
additional variables: T1 lesion volume ; T2 lesion volume; annualized relapse rate; disability as 
measured by [CONTACT_239461] (EDSS) and Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC); cognitive impairment as measured by [CONTACT_262155] l Digit Modality Test 
(SDMT) and Selective Reminding Test; quality of life as measured by [CONTACT_262156] (MSIS -29), EuroQol 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D), and Short Form-36 Health  Survey (SF -36); 
and neuropathic pain, as measured by [CONTACT_7854] (BPI) in a subset of subjects with central neuropathic pain.  All will be assessed using either a linear mixed model (for continuous 
outcomes) or a generalized linear mixed model (for binary our count data).  However, it is 
important to note that these are not the main focus of this study. Hence, we did not power for any of these comparisons, they are not involved directly in the “go”/”no go” decision, and should be considered as exploratory hypothesis generating analyses. We will also assess the activity of ibudilast at 96 weeks versus placebo as measured by [CONTACT_28760]-brain gray matter fraction, MTR in gray matter, new T1 lesions since baseline and new T2 lesions since baseline. Finally, additional exploratory analyses will seek pharmacokinetics (PK) of  ibudilast using a population PK Commented [CCS2]: Per email from R. Fox on 09/09/2016,

clinical measures of progressive disability.  
12.1.3. Sample Size Justification  
Primary Objective: Estimated required sample size for the primary objective was computed 
based on two pi[INVESTIGATOR_261990]. The first pi[INVESTIGATOR_232879] (DS1) consisted of N = 
30 PP subjects (n=15 female; mean age 58.6 y ears; mean disease duration 7.3 years; mean EDSS 
4.97) who participated in the placebo arm of a clinical trial for the chemotherapy drug mitoxantrone (Kita  et al  2004). A maximum of three repeated measures were available, collected 
over 24 months.  
The second pi[INVESTIGATOR_232879] (DS2) consisted of N  = [ADDRESS_318790] size for the power analysis was defined as the percentage difference in linear slope 
relative to a hypothetical treatment group. That is, the percentage reduction in linear 
deterioration of the treated group in a hypothetical intervention. The pi[INVESTIGATOR_261991] (Altmann  et al  2009) suggested a reasonable range of percentage difference was 30% to 50%. 
Also of note, an earlier study was performed assessing the activity of ibudilast in relapsing MS, 
and this study included measurement of brain atrophy. While the earlier study used a different atrophy measure (SIENA) than in this proposal (BPF), and had only two time points, it did show effects sizes of approximately 33% -36%, (Bark hof et al 2010) which could be considered an 
appropriate target for the power analysis.  
Power calculations were based on a LMM appropriate for clinical trials  (Yi and Panzarella, 
2002; Heo and Leon, 2009). Because there was only one site for the pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299], the LMM of Equation (1) was used as the basis for the power analysis. Presentation of the required sample size equations is facilitated by [CONTACT_262157]. Consider the following equalities for the parameters of Equation (1),  
[𝛼𝛼
𝑃𝑃𝛽𝛽𝑃𝑃𝛾𝛾 𝛿𝛿 ]𝑇𝑇=[𝛽𝛽0𝛽𝛽1𝛽𝛽2𝛽𝛽3]𝑇𝑇=𝜷𝜷𝑇𝑇,  
[𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖𝑏𝑏𝑖𝑖]𝑇𝑇=[𝑏𝑏0𝑖𝑖𝑏𝑏1𝑖𝑖]𝑇𝑇=𝒃𝒃𝑖𝑖𝑇𝑇.                                  (1)  
(Recall that γ = 0 to constrain the groups to be equal at baseline. ) Then the LMM of Equation (1) 
can be written in matrix notation as  
𝒀𝒀𝑖𝑖=𝑿𝑿𝑖𝑖𝜷𝜷+𝒁𝒁𝑖𝑖𝒃𝒃𝑖𝑖+𝝐𝝐𝑖𝑖, 
where each matrix has row dimension ni; Xi is the design matrix of the fixed effects, and Z i is the 
design matrix for the random effects. X i has four columns, the first being a vector of 1s, the 
second being t ij, the third being g i, and the fourth being t ij ⋅ gi. Zi consists of the first two columns 
of Xi.  
The
 required sample size depends on the variance of the responses,  
𝑽𝑽𝑖𝑖=𝑉𝑉𝑎𝑎𝑉𝑉(𝒀𝒀𝑖𝑖)=𝒁𝒁𝑖𝑖𝑮𝑮𝒁𝒁𝑖𝑖𝑇𝑇+𝜎𝜎2𝑰𝑰𝑖𝑖 
and t

 where XP is the design matrix for the placebo group, X T is the design matrix for the treatment 
group, and the subscript (4,4) indicates the element in the 4th row and 4th column of the matrix. 
The value of δ is varied to represent  effect sizes of 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, and 50%, which is the 
hypothetical slope difference between the treatment and placebo groups.  
The analysis used the proposed time points of 0, 24, 48, 72, and 96 weeks. Power curves were 
computed for DS1, DS2, and for  their average (Avg). Avg was based on averaging the LMM 
parameter estimates across the data sets (eg , average slope = [DS1 slope + DS2 slope] / 2). Avg 
was an attempt to pool information from the two data sets without the raw data (the raw data for DS2 was  unavailable). A 10% dropout rate was assumed and all estimated sample sizes were 
inflated by [CONTACT_262158] ( ie, final sample size = initial sample size × 1.10). Given the resources 
required for obtaining and analyzing 3T scans, the type I error rate was set at α = 0.10. Figure [ADDRESS_318791] sizes (30%, 35%, 40%). Focusing on Avg for the middle effect size (35%), the figure indicates that a single- arm N / 2 = 125 provides close to 
80% (power = 0.80 is the horizontal dashed line). The middle effect size is important as it nearly corresponds to the upper effect size of the aforementioned ibudilast study (effect size = 36%). 
The Avg data source is preferred because it approximates a pooling of t he information from both 
samples. The feasibility of N / 2 = [ADDRESS_318792] sizes with α = 0.10 for all three data sources (DS1, DS2, Avg). The 
power by [CONTACT_262159] 3. T he figure clearly shows that 
the study has adequate power across the range of possible values suggested by [CONTACT_233197]. For the “best” data (DS1), our study has slightly less than 90% power to detect  effects 
of approximately 40% or larger, and more than 90% power to detect effects on the upper end of the range of interest (50%). Most importa ntly, the figure shows that the power based on the Avg 
data source is very high for effect s in the 33% - 36%  range of greatest interest (approximately 
80% - 85% ). Therefore, based on these assumptions, we are confident that a per -arm sample size 
of N / 2 = 125 ( N = 250 total participants) is sufficient to help ensure statistically reliable results 
for the proposed s tudy.

months. Equation (2) was the basis for computing required sample size based on the LMM. In 
order to express power (1 −

quantities, the following equation can be used

show that the estimated power was greater than 0.[ADDRESS_318794] size (30% difference

The three levels of nesting represented by [INVESTIGATOR_8850] (4) (month nested within eye nested within 
patient) presents a challenge for deriving power equations, and analytic results are usually based on simplifying assumptions ( eg, fewer random effects than in Equation (4)) (Heo and Leon, 
2009). In order to base the power estimate on the LMM of Equation (4), a simulation approach was used. For the simulation, the LMM of Equation (4) was fit to the pi[INVESTIGATOR_261995] s. For each replication, 
a random number generator was used to compute random effects and random error for N  = 250 
hypothetical treatment and control patients based on the appropriate covariance structures (eg , 
G). Then simulated OCT response values were computed based on the fixed and random effects 
and random error of Equation (4). For each replication, the null hypothesis of H

Ibudilast is purported to ha ve neuroprotective effects, and so these data were used as a model to

brain MTR measured at baseline, 24 weeks, 1 year, and 2 years as part of a multi-center pha se III 
clinical trial using 1.5T MRIs and the stock manufacturer pulse sequence. Only descriptive

 statistics were available for change between baseline and two years. There was a placebo group 
and two treatment groups, one receiving BG-12 240 mg twice a da y (b.i.d. ) and the second 
receiving BG-12 240 mg three times per day day ( t.i.d.). The statistics available for the study 
were means of change scores and their standard deviations. Thus, power was estimated based on an independent t -test of the mean baseline to 2 year difference in MTR scores for the treatment 
(BG-12) and placebo groups.  Power was computed using the conventional formula

where δ is the difference of the mean change scores and σ2 is the pooled variance of the 
difference. A subset of patients had no new or enlarging T2 legions, and the analysis was 
performed twice: once for all the patients and another time excluding the patients with no lesions. The results of the power analysis are shown in the table below . As see n in the table, the 
lowest estimated power (t.i.d., all patients) was greater than the conventional cut-off of 0.80. 
When only subjects with no new lesions were considered (which more closely approximates what we expect in the proposed trial), estimated po wer was even greater than the conventional 
level . The table suggests that N  =[ADDRESS_318800] T  and P

CLADA and NFL from CSF : No pi[INVESTIGATOR_261997] . However, we expect both CLADA and NFL effects to be 
consistent with those of the other secondary endpoints. Therefore, we are confident that 
statistical power for CLADA will be sufficient to detect effect sizes similar to those discussed for 
the other secondary endpoints. The power for NFL will depend upon the number of subjects who agree to have lumbar punctures.  
Safety  Objective: With an overall significance level  of 0.10, the study will have 80% or greater 
power to detect differences in safety or tolerability of 15% or greater across the two groups.  Thus, minor safety concerns may not be detected in this study – and would need to be assessed in a larger, future p hase [ADDRESS_318801] 
(DSMB) will meet at approximately 6-month intervals to review study progress ( eg, enrollment, 
Protocol NN102 SPRINT -MS with Amendment 6.[ADDRESS_318802] retention, etc.) as well as blinded study data (safety and efficacy) 
provided by [CONTACT_15791].  The frequency and format of DSMB meetings, reports, and guidelines for interim analysis will be agreed upon prior to study initiation.  
We propose to have one interim efficacy analysis at a time when half of the subjects have completed their Week 96  follow -up visit.  For this interim analysis, we propose to use the Lan-
DeMets spending function approach with O’Brien -Fleming stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_74239]. Table 10 
illustrates the proposed stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_261998] 2 equally spaced analyses (one interim analysis and the planned final analysis).  However, the Lan-DeMets method allows 
for analyses at unequal intervals and without having to pre -specify the time of any interim 
analyses.  Hence, the proposed method has the flexibility to adapt should the DSMB request an interim analysis at an alternative time point or if the DSMB doesn’t meet after exact ly half of the 
patients complete their Week [ADDRESS_318803] a formal futility 
assessment at the time of the interim efficacy  analysis. The futility assessment will be based on a 
determination of the predictive power. If this predictive power is below 20% at the time of the interim analysis, then we propose that the trial should stop for futility.  In the event of early study 
termination because of overwhelming efficacy, all participants would be offered open -label 
active treatment, if feasible. The protocol and informed consent would be revised accordingly. Similar to all previous analysis, the statistical models will constrain the groups to be equal at baseline to account for vagaries in randomization that result in initial imbalance (Senn, 2013).

About this consent form  
 
Please read this form carefully.  It tells you important information about a research study.  A member of our research team will also talk to you about taking part in this research study.  People who agree to take part in research studies are called “subjects.”  This term will be used throughout this consent for m. 
 
{Name [CONTACT_50854]} is {description of site} . We are doing this research as part of the Network for Excellence in 
Neuroscience Clinical Trials (NeuroNEXT), which is supported by [CONTACT_262174] (NINDS).  
 If you ha ve any questions about the research or about this form, please ask us.  Taking part in this research study is 
up to you.  If you decide to take part in this research study, you must sign this form to show that you want to take 
part.  We will give you a signed copy of this form to keep.  
 
A description of this clinical trial will be available on http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov
, as required by U.S. law.  That 
website will not include information that can identify you.  At most, the website will eventually include a summary of the results of the study.  You can search this website at anytime.  
 
Why is this research study being done?  
 The study will be conducted by [CONTACT_262175] 
(NeuroNEXT) in  about  28 sites around the [LOCATION_002].  
 
{Place any Conflict of Interest disclosures mandated by [CONTACT_262176].}  
 
We are doing this research study to find out if the drug ibudilast can help people with progressive multiple sclerosis 
(MS). We will also find out if it is safe to take without causing too many side effects.  
 
Ibudilast is not approved for use by [CONTACT_3133] (FDA). This means that ibudilast can 
only be used in research studies. This drug has been given to approximately [ADDRESS_318816] to placebo. The ‘placebo’ looks like the study  
drug, ibudilast capsules, but contains no active study drug. We will assign you by [CONTACT_3364] (like a coin toss) to the 
ibudilast group or the placebo group.  You and the Study Doctor cannot choose your study group.  You will have a  [ADDRESS_318817] been diagnosed with a progressive form of multiple 
sclerosis. Currently, mitoxant rone is the only FDA -approved therapy for secondary progressive MS, but is not 
commonly used because of its risks of heart injury and blood cancers ( i.e., leukemia).  
 About 250 people will take part in this study.  We plan to enroll about 10- 15 people at  {Insert Site Name} . 
 
This research study is supported by a federal grant awarded by [CONTACT_52993]/National Institute of 
Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) through the Network for Excellence in Neurological Clinical Trials (NeuroNEXT). The National Multiple Sclerosis Society and MediciNova, Inc. are also supporting this research 
study.  The study drug (ibudilast and placebo) used for this research study is supplied by [CONTACT_262177], Inc. a biopharmaceutical company developi[INVESTIGATOR_262027] .  
 
How long will I take part in this research study? 
 It will take you about 26 months (a little over 2 years) to complete this study.  You can expect a total of 13 study 
visits during this time, although more visits may be required if your Study Doctor decides they are needed for medical reasons.  
 
 
What will happen in this research study?  
 
You will go to the {Insert Site Name}  for all of your study visits. {Insert Site Investigator 
Name} , your main Treating Doctor (called the “Study Doctor” in this Consent Form), will explain to you in 
more detail about the method of gathering information that is important in conducting clinical research.  
If you choose to take part in this study, we will ask you to sign this consent form before we do any research 
procedures.  
 Screening Visit  
The Screening Visit will take about [ADDRESS_318818] for 12 hours prior to this visit.  The Study 
Doctor will review the results of these tests and procedures.  If you don ’t qualify, the Study Doctor will tell you 
why.  
 At this visit, we will:  
• Ask you questions about your medical history, including your MS.  
• Ask you about medications you are taking or have taken.  Bring bottles (both empty and full) of medications you curren tly use.  
• Perform a physical exam and measure your vital signs, including heart rate and blood pressure.  
• Measure your weight.  
• Ask you to complete the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS).This test helps to measure your multiple 
sclerosis disease status.  For this test, we will give you a complete neurological exam and ask you to walk 
500 meters.  
• Ask you to complete the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC). This test measures your walking ability, how well you can move your hands, and how well yo u can see.  
• Ask you to complete some cognitive tests.  These tests will tell us about your cognition (thinking).  
• Perform Ocular Coherence Tomography (OCT). This is a painless scan of the retina in the back of your 
eyes, one of the areas affected by [INVESTIGATOR_46427].  
• Draw blood samples.  We will draw a total of about 15 tablespoons  of blood over the course of this 
research study.  
• Ask you for a urine sample.  
• Test your blood for pregnancy, if you are a woman who is able to become pregnant.  Pregnant women 
cannot take par t in this research study.

 • Give you an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan.  An MRI scan is a large medical imaging device that 
uses powerful magnets to create a pi[INVESTIGATOR_262028] (scan) that can determine the areas affected by 
[CONTACT_164898]. Thi s test is painless and takes about 60 minutes.  
• Perform an optional spi[INVESTIGATOR_122499].For this test, we collect some spi[INVESTIGATOR_262029] 
a needle. There may be some discomfort with this test.  
• Perform an electrocardiogram (ECG), a test to measure your heart function. For this test we will place several small, sticky pads on your chest, arms and legs. Each pad has a wire attached. The wires connect to a machine that makes a recording of your heart rhythm. This painless test takes about 15 minutes.  
• Ask you to complete some questionnaires about your health, daily life, how you are feeling, and your MS.  
 Optional Spi[INVESTIGATOR_262030], we will ask you to undergo a spi[INVESTIGATOR_262031], Week 48 (visit 8) and Week 96 
(visit 12).
 The Screening Visit Spi[INVESTIGATOR_262032].  This 
is being done to  find out  if spi[INVESTIGATOR_872], scans and physical exams all give us different  information about disease 
progression.  You do not need to have the spi[INVESTIGATOR_262033]. For this test, we 
collect some spi[INVESTIGATOR_262029] a needle. This test takes about 20- 30 minutes.  
 A local anesthetic (numbing medicine) will be injected into the area on your back. You might feel a burning 
sensation until the medicine begins to work. When the area is numb, a hollow needle is inserted in the lower back 
between the two lumbar vertebrae (bones in your lower spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]). This sometimes causes a pressure sensation. The 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_262034], and fluid is collected. The spi[INVESTIGATOR_262035]. You might feel some discomfort.  
 Baseline Visit (Visit 2)  
This visit will take about 2 hours. At this visit, we will: 
• Ask you about your health and medications.  
• Ask you about any side effects you may have experienced and how you have been feeling.  
• Measure your vital signs.  
• Draw a blood sample. 
• Ask for a urine sample. 
• Test your urine for pregnancy, if you are a woman who is a ble to become pregnant.  
• Perform an MRI.  
• Ask you to complete the EDSS and MSFC tests.  
• Ask you to complete some questionnaires about your health, daily life, how you are feeling, and your MS.  
 
If you still qualify for this study, we will assign you by [CONTACT_3364]  (like a coin toss) to the ibudilast group or the placebo 
group.  You and the Study Doctor cannot choose which group you are in.  
You will have a [ADDRESS_318819] or placebo.  
 
You and the Study Doctor will not know which group yo u are in, but the Study Doctor can find out if  medically  
necessary.  
 Taking the Study Drug  
You will begin taking 3 capsules of your assigned study drug (ibudilast or placebo) by [CONTACT_104744] (dosage 60 mg/day) for 14 days. Beginning on Day 15, we will  increase your dose to 5 capsules taken by [CONTACT_104744] 
(dosage 100 mg/day ).  Study drug should always be taken with food.  However, in the event that you are having 
difficulty tolerating the study drug (nausea, diarrhea) by [CONTACT_112216] 14, you may  continue taking 3 capsules 
twice a day until Day 21. If, after 21 days, you are still having difficulty tolerating the study drug, you may stop taking the study drug. If tolerability is acceptable after 21 days, your dosage will be increased to 5 capsules  twice a

What are the risks and possible discomforts from being in this research study? 
 
Risks of Taking Ibudilast  
 1. Ibudilast has been used for the treatment of asthma and post -stroke disorders in Japan for more than  [ADDRESS_318825] common reported side 
effects were:  
• appetite loss  
• nausea  
• diarrhea  
• elevated liver enzymes which is an indication of liver damage- (uncommon, between 1 and 10 out of a 
1000)  
• headache  
 
 2. Approximately [ADDRESS_318826] been seen.  The side effects that were seen in a 2 year study 
were GI (gastrointestinal, meaning the stomach and intestines; include nausea and diarrhea; increase in liver 
enzymes)  related . 
  3. Ibudilast has bee n given to nearly 300 patients with relapsing remitting MS . There were 20  serious adverse 
events (side  effects) reported. Most of the serious adverse events were gastrointestinal in nature or having to do with 
bone fractures.  All of these serious adverse events were considered by [CONTACT_262180].  Six of the serious adverse events were considered severe and two were considered life -threatening.  
Nine subjects discontinued from the study due to a side effect.  Two  side effects (liver disorders) were possibly 
related to taking ibudilast.  
 
As in the earlier trials, the most common side effects were:  
 
• Nausea 
• Diarrhea  
• Headache 
• Increase in liver enzyme  
 
As noted from the above mentioned studies, GI distress, which includes nausea and diarrhea, appear to be the most common side effects. The GI symptoms associated with ibudilast tend to occur early (within 1 -2 weeks) and 
usually last for only a few days or weeks, and then improve. These symptoms may be relieved with anti -diarrheal or 
anti-nausea drugs, if necessary. Usually a majority of those receiving ibudilast recover from these symptoms within 
several days (with or without anti- diarrheal drugs). Talk to your Study Doctor if you experience these symptoms, 
particularly if they last for more than [ADDRESS_318827] are cold symptoms, itching sensation, rash, dizziness, tremors, insomnia, drowsiness, sudden blushing , anorexia (decreased appetite), abdominal pain, abdominal bloating, 
palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], flushed appearance, anemia (low red blood cell counts), low white blood cells, tiredness, facial edema 
(swelling), abnormal sound sensitivity (changes in your hearing) and metallic taste in mouth.     
 
Risk of Allergic Reaction  
As with any drug, an allergic reaction can occur.  Allergic reactions can be mild or serious, and can even result in 
death in some cases.  Common symptoms of an allergic reaction are rash, itching, ski n problems, swelling of the 
face and throat, or trouble breathing.  If you think you are having an allergic reaction, call the Study Doctor right away.  If you are having trouble breathing, call [ADDRESS_318828] that we don’t know about at this time.  New information about 
ibudilast may become available during this study. If this happens, your Study Doctor will tell you about any new 
information that could affect your willingness to tak e part in the study.  We may ask you to sign a new Consent 
Form that includes the new information.  
 
Pregnancy and Fertility Risks  
The effect of ibudilast on an embryo or fetus (developi[INVESTIGATOR_191278]), or on a breastfeeding infant, is 
unknown and may be harmful.  Because of these unknown risks , if you are capable of giving birth to or fathering 
a child, you and your sexual partner should use adequate birth control measures while you are in this study.   
If you are a female who is sexually active and able to become pregnant, or a man with a sexual partner who is able 
to become pregnant, you must agree to use one of the birth control methods listed below. You must use birth control for the entire study and at least [ADDRESS_318829] dose of stu dy drug. Acceptable birth control methods for this 
study are:  
 
• Abstinence (no sex)  
• Oral contraceptives (birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353])  
• IUD (a small T -shaped device containing either copper or a hormone inserted into the womb for birth 
control)  
• Diaphragm with spermicide (a foam, cream or gel that kills sperm)  
• Norplant  (birth control capsules that are inserted in the skin of the upper arm of a female)  
• Approved hormone injections  
• Condoms with spermicide  
 Women cannot take part in this study if the y are:  
 
• Pregnant  
• Trying to become pregnant  
• Breastfeeding  
 
If during the study you think you are pregnant, you must tell your Study Doctor and stop taking the study drug 
immediately. Your Study Doctor will ask you about the outcome of your pregnancy.  
 Men cannot take part in this study if they are actively trying to get their sexual partner pregnant.   During this study if 
you think your partner is pregnant you must tell the Study Doctor immediately.  Your Study Doctor will ask you 
about the outcome of your  partner’s pregnancy. 
 
Risks of MRI  
MRI examination releases radio waves, which are very noisy.  We will give you earplugs. You may experience brief claustrophobia (fear as a result of being in a small, enclosed space) during the MRI procedure. Some patients feel discomfort associated with lying still within the magnet. If you need it, the doctor can give you some medication to 
make you less anxious and help you relax.   
 
Because MRI uses strong magnets, people with cardiac pacemakers, certain artificial heart valves, metal plates, pi[INVESTIGATOR_2115], or other metallic objects in your body (including gun shot debris or shrapnel) or other metallic/electronic material in 
their body cannot undergo MRI and will not be eligible for this study.  
 
Risks of Unexpected Findings 
You will have several MRIs during this study. MRIs are generally not performed in patients with progressive 
MS. The MRIs done for this study will not affect the care you receive for your disease. The study MRIs are being done to learn more about the effects of the study drug on the brain.  
It is possible these MRIs could show us something that looks like an abnormality or problem.  If we do see something that looks like a medical problem, we will ask a radiologist (a doctor who specializes in x -rays/scans/test 
Protocol NN102 SPRINT -MS with Amendment 5.0                                               24 Feb 2015

 results of this sort) to review  the results.  If the radiologist thinks there might be a problem, we will tell you and help 
you get follow -up care.   
If the radiologist thinks that you might have a medical problem, but it turns out that you don’t, we may have 
caused you to worry needles sly about your health.  
 
Risks of Blood Draw  
You may have a bruise (a black and blue mark) or pain where we take the blood samples.  There is also a small risk of feeling lightheaded, fainting, or infection.  
 
Risks of Optional  Spi[INVESTIGATOR_262038] a standard procedure used in medical practice. When spi[INVESTIGATOR_262039] a spi[INVESTIGATOR_122499], the risks include headache, bleeding and pain at the site where the needle was put in, and infection. Pain during the 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_262040] (lidocaine). Infection after a  spi[INVESTIGATOR_262041], but serious, and would be treated with antibiotics.  
 
About [ADDRESS_318830] -spi[INVESTIGATOR_262042]. Headache can occur if the lining 
around the spi[INVESTIGATOR_872] (dura) is torn and some of the fluid leaks out. Post -spi[INVESTIGATOR_262043] [ADDRESS_318831] [ENTER PI [CONTACT_4909]], who is in charge of this study. Pain medication will be given to you, if needed. If the headache lasts more than three days, a procedure called a blood patch may be performed. This procedure involves taking blood from your arm and injecting it in the same place w here the spi[INVESTIGATOR_262044]. The clotting of the blood in this space should stop further fluid leaking and 
stop the headache.  
 
Bleeding may occur in 1 -2% of patients that undergo spi[INVESTIGATOR_122499]. If you are currently taking blood thi nner 
medications you may be at a higher risk of bleeding and will not be eligible to undergo spi[INVESTIGATOR_122499].  
 Do you agree to let us do a spi[INVESTIGATOR_262045] 48 and Week 96 Visits?  
 
 
  YES   NO   Initials_________________  
 
You can change your mind about this later.  If you change your mind, tell the Study Doctor.  
   
What are the possible benefits from being in this research study? 
 
You may not experience any medical benefit from taking part in this research study.  While you are in this study, your MS may improve, but it is also possible that your MS may remain the same, or get wo rse.  
 What we learn from this study may help to identify a new therapy for progressive MS patients and/or identify new tools to monitor MS disease progression in progressive MS patients. Others with progressive MS may benefit in the future from what we learn in this study.  
Protocol NN102 SPRINT -MS with Amendment 5.0                                               24 Feb 2015

What other treatments or procedures are available for my condition?  
You do not have to take part in this study to be treated for your progressive MS. Currently, mitoxantrone is the only 
FDA -approved therapy for secondary progressive MS , but is not commonly used because of its risks of heart injury 
and blood cancers ( i.e., leukemia). Some symptoms of progressive MS may be helped by [CONTACT_14759], stretching, and 
physical and occupational therapy. There are also medications which may be used t o treat some symptoms of 
progressive MS such as bladder and bowel urgency (an urgent need to go to the bathroom), erectile problems, 
spasticity, and pain, if such treatments are needed. You can talk to the Study Doctor and your own doctor about 
other treat ments and procedures that are available for progressive MS, including other research studies.  
Can I still get medical care within {Insert Site Name} if I don’t take part 
in this research study, or if I stop taking part?  
 
Yes. Your decision won’t change the medical care you get from us now or in the future. There will be no penalty, and you won’t l ose any benefits you receive now or have a right to receive.  
 Taking part in this research study is up to you. You can decide not to take part. If you decide to take part now, you 
can change your mind and drop out later. We will tell you if we learn new information that could make you change 
your mind about taking part in this research study.  
 
What should I do if I want to stop taking part in the study?  
 If you take part in this research study, and want to drop out, you should tell us. We will also talk t o you about 
follow -up care, if needed. We will make sure that you stop the study safely. If you decide to stop taking the study 
drug, you will be asked to come in for visit 13, which should occur approximately [ADDRESS_318832] to ask you to drop out before you finish the study. If this happens, we will tell you 
why. We will also help arra nge other care for you, if needed.
 
Will I be paid to take part in this research study?  
 
Yes. We will pay you $50 for each in- person study visit, including any relapse visits , $25 for each lab re -check visit, 
and $100 for each spi[INVESTIGATOR_122499]. We will pay you approximately  $700 over the two- year study period  if you complete 
all the in -person visits for this study but do not complete the 3 optional spi[INVESTIGATOR_262046], or $1,[ADDRESS_318833] to pay for if I take part in this research study? 
 
Study funds will pay for study related tests, procedures, and visits. One of the study sponsors (MediciNova Inc.) will provide the study drug at no cost to you. The cost of routine tests and services  that would normally be performed 
even if you don’t take part in the study will be billed to you or your insurance provider. You will be responsible for payment of any deductibles and co -payments required by [CONTACT_262181]. If 
you have any questions about costs to you that may result from taking part in the research, please speak with the Study Doctors and study staff. If necessary, they will arrange for you to speak with someone in the {Insert Site 
Name} Patient Fin ancial Services about these costs.

 Appendix 5: DSMB Guidelines  
Data and Safety Monitoring Board for the Network of Excellence in Neuroscience Clinical Trials 
(NeuroNEXT)  
  
Data and Safety Monitoring Board Guidelines  
1. Introduction  
The Data and Safety Monitoring Board will act in an advisory capacity to the National Institute of 
Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) to monitor participant safety, data quality, and to 
evaluate the progress and overall conduct of NeuroNEXT -supported trials.   
DSMB monitoring is required for trials which may modify the current standards of treatment or public 
health policy, result in the licensing of a therapeutic agent or device, or extend approved indications to new group s of patients. This includes Phase III clinical trials and possibly some earlier phase trials  
(eg, this could include  trials that involve multiple sites, pose significant risk to participants, are 
conducted in vulnerable populations,  or use certain controversial interventions).    
2.  Responsibil ities 
The DSMB is responsible for assuring the NINDS that study participants are not exposed to unnecessary or unreasonable risks and that the study is being conducted according to high scientifi c 
and ethical standards.  Specifically, the DSMB will:  
• Review the research protocol, informed consent documents and plans for safety monitoring and advise the NINDS on readiness to begin enrollment  
 Assess the performance of the trial with respect to participant recruitment, retention and follow -up, protocol adherence, and data quality and completeness, in order to ensure the 
likelihood of successful and timely trial completion.  
 Review the statistica l analysis plan, including the interim analysis plan, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_262051].   
 One DSMB member, when possible a clinician, may be unblinded to treatment assignment.  Monitor interim data regarding the safety and efficacy of the study regi mens, so that the trial 
will be concluded as soon as there is convincing evidence of the treatment effects.  Review abstract and publications of main findings prior to submission to ensure the study is being reported appropriately.  
 Review and consider any  protocol modifications or ancillary studies proposed by [CONTACT_262184].  For example, addition of an ancillary study could burden the study participants s o 
much that they are likely to discontinue participation in the trial.  Protocol modifications will be considered in the context of their potential impact on scientific integrity and participant 
safety. The DSMB will be responsible for the data and safety monitoring of the ancillary 
study.   
 Monitor recruitment progress.  
 Monitor lost to follow -up.  
 Review data completeness and quality.  
 Monitor missing data.

  Recommend planned adaptations based on pre -specified plans and decision rules.  
 Advise the NINDS a nd the study investigators as to whether a protocol should continue as 
scheduled or undergo a modification due to findings that emerged as a result of the 
monitoring process.  
 Consider factors external to the study when relevant information becomes available, such a 
scientific or therapeutic developments that may have an impact on the safety of participants or the ethics of the trial.  
 Review abstract and publication of main findings prior to submission to ensure the study is 
being reported appropriately.  
Enrollment in a study cannot begin until the DSMB’s recommendation for approval to begin has been 
accepted by [CONTACT_262185].  
3. Membership  
The DSMB is appointed by [CONTACT_262186]. The voting members may include physicians, 
laboratory scientists, statisticians, ethicists and patient advocates. Collectively, they will have appropriate expertise in the relevant scientific and safety monitoring areas. The precise number and 
areas of expertise of DSMB members will be dictated by [CONTACT_262187]. Study 
investigators may suggest to the NINDS appropriate individuals to serve on the DSMB. NINDS 
representatives will participate on the DSMB as non -voting members.  
The number of DSMB members for each NeuroNEXT trial may vary depending on the size, disease, and complexity of the trial and could range from three to five or more members.  It is expected that 
DSMB members attend every meeting and every call.  However since that might not always be 
possi ble, a quorum is considered to be half of the standing members plus one.  The Board may wish 
to decide if particular expertise is needed within the quorum for the meeting to be valid.  
To avoid any appearance of conflict of interest, it is critical that DS MB membe rs not be involved in 
the studies have no vested interest in their  outcome, have no ties to the study investigators ( eg, not 
from the same institution and no history of extensive collaboration), and have no financial ties to any commercial concerns  likely to be affected by [CONTACT_262188]’  outcome. If at any time a DSMB member 
perceives that he/she or another member of the Board (including an NINDS representative) has a 
potential conflict of interest, he/she is obligated to bring the issue to the attenti on of the full DSMB for 
open discussion and resolution. The NINDS requires DSMB members to complete a conflict of 
interest disclosure form and a statement of confidentiality  on an annual basis.   
4. Initial Meeting  
Before any study is opened to subject accr ual, the DSMB will meet in conjunction with the study 
prinicipal investigator  (PI)  and study statistician to review the study protocol,
 particularly the specific 
outcome definitions, the analysis plan, the procedures for recording and reporting SAEs, the monitoring proposal, pre- specified interim analysis plan and decision rules, and pre- specified plans 
for adaptation and decision rules.  The informed consent document/process also will be inspected to ensure that all required elements have been included in language understandable to a typi[INVESTIGATOR_262052].  It is possible that the DSMB will recommend modification or clarification of the protocol, especially relating to the monitoring plan.  A carefully considered, final moni toring plan is important to establish at the outset, because any subsequent deviation from the 
pre-specified plan may diminish the scientific integrity and credibility of the study.  
Protocol NN102 SPRINT -MS with Amendment 5.[ADDRESS_318836] will formulat e its operating procedures. 
These procedures will include such issues as: the types and formats of reports it will receive from 
the PI [INVESTIGATOR_262053]; the policy on whether and how the members may be unblinded; what 
interim data (if any) may be rel eased to the study investigators ( eg, overall event rate); and how 
SAEs will be submitted for DSMB review.  
The DSMB decides in their first meeting if DSMB members will be unblinded.   If the DSMB decides 
to remain blinded, they should consider assigning one DSMB member, when possible a clinician, to 
be unblinded to treatment assignment.   The unblinded DSMB member may decide to unblind other 
DSMB members as indicated, and for example based on concerns over SAE imbalances between 
study groups  
5. Meeting F requency and Format  
The DSMB will meet regularly to monitor the cumulative safety data during the period when 
participants are receiving study intervention and during the participant follow -up period. Meetings are 
generally held four times a year to review and discuss new and ongoing studies and will be generally 
scheduled in February, May, August and November each year. Additional meetings or conference 
calls will be scheduled as needed should participant safety questions or other unanticipated 
problems ari se.   Up to two meetings annually will be held in- person in the Washington, DC area.   
Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], the DSMB will review each ongoing trial at least twice a year ; in no instance should more 
than [ADDRESS_318837] has 
enrolled. The DSMB responsibilities for monitoring and oversight conclude when the study is done 
and data has been verified and ready for publication.  
The NINDS DSMB meeting format consists of three sessions: Closed Executive Sessions, Open 
Sessions, and Optional DSMB Sessions with Program Official.  The meeting format, including the 
number of open and closed sessions, and the participation in these sessions is at the discretion of 
the DSMB.  The DSMB Chair, in conjunction with  the NINDS DSMB Liaison, is responsible for the 
DSMB operations and will set the meeting agenda.  Before each meeting, the DSMB Liaison will ask 
all DSMB members to state whether they have developed any new conflicts of interest since the last 
formal repor t to the NINDS.   
Closed Executive Sessions :  Only DSMB members and NINDS DSMB Liaison participate in closed 
executive sessions, to ensure complete objectivity as they discuss outcome results by [CONTACT_262189], make decisions, and formulate recomm endations regarding the study.  The DSMB Chair 
may request additional participants during this session, eg, MSM, unblinded study statistician.  
Open Sessions:  DSMB members, NINDS Staff, study PIs and study statistician(s) attend this 
session, at which data concerning study conduct and aggregate safety data are discussed.  
Optional DSMB Sessions with Program Official:  DSMB members, NINDS DSMB Lia ison, and 
NINDS Administrative PD attend this session.  During this session no unblinded data (closed report) 
will be discussed, but other trial issues, such as recruitment, can be discussed in the absence of the 
investigators.  
6. Interim Data Reports  
For each trial, t he format and reporting requirement of unblinded data should be discussed and 
agreed upon at the first DSMB meeting. In general, the study statistician will prepare study data reports and send these to the NINDS DSMB Liaison at least [ADDRESS_318838] 
all copi[INVESTIGATOR_262054].  
The Open Session report will focus on study participant accrual and demographics, data completeness, and other study performance measures, any new information (on the intervention or 
disease/disor der) that may affect the outcome of the trial, and a list of publications or presentations.  
All data in the Open Session report will be presented in the aggregate, ie, not by [CONTACT_11512].  The Closed Session report will divide study participants according to cumulative data 
or coded treatment assignment ( eg, Treatments A vs. B), comparing participant demographics and 
baseline characteristics, rates of and reasons for treatment discontinuation and loss to follow -up, 
rates of SAEs and, if an interim  efficacy analysis is scheduled, rates of efficacy outcomes 
(depending on the trial ). 
Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], the PI [INVESTIGATOR_262055] a report addressing specific concerns he or she anticipates the 
DSMB will have regarding the conduct of the study. This report should be sent to the NINDS  Liaison  
for distribution to the DSMB along with the Open Session report  as noted above . Likewise, the study 
statistician's report for the Closed Session will usually contain his or her assessment of the progress 
of the trial, includin g recommendations on whether it should be terminated or modified. Interim data 
reports will generally include the following types of information, although only the Closed Session 
data reports will include comparisons by [CONTACT_1570]. If the randomizatio n is stratified ( eg, by 
[CONTACT_654]), these tables and figures are presented by [CONTACT_1534]:  
 A summary of monthly accrual and cumulative accrual, overall and by [CONTACT_138554], 
compared to targets.  
 A summary of baseline characteristics, overall and by [CONTACT_1570].  
 A summary of the completeness and quality of data collection forms.  
 A summary of the status of enrolled participants, overall and by [CONTACT_1570]. (Study 
status includes whether the subject is on study or off study. For participants who are on study, there should be an indication as to whether they are on study treatment or off 
treatment. For participants who are off study, the reason should be indicated ( ie, completed 
study, died, refused further participation, lost -to-followup, or other).  
 Summari es of participants off treatment, including a listing by [CONTACT_262190] (overall and by [CONTACT_1570]) of the reasons for going off treatment, the proportion of participants off 
treatment prior to reaching the study outcome, and the proportion of participants going off treatment each study month.  
 Assessments of whether the clinical centers have followed eligibility criteria and other 
protocol requirements.  
 An assessment ( eg, based on pi[INVESTIGATOR_262056]) of subject adherence to the treatment 
regimen, overall and by [CONTACT_1570].  
 A summary of outcome rates by [CONTACT_1570], if an interim efficacy analysis is scheduled.  
 A listing of individual SAEs by [CONTACT_262191] a table of event -specific cumulative 
rates, overall and by [CONTACT_1570].  
  A listing of AEs by [CONTACT_262192].  
 A listing of protocol violations, if any.

SAE Reporting :  see protocol section 11.6.1 for SAE reporting.  
 
Planned Interim analyses:  see section 12.1.[ADDRESS_318839] interim treatment -
specific results.   
The DSMB Chair will prov ide meeting minutes, including the DSMB’s recommendations to the 
Director of the NINDS Office of Clinical Research, through the NINDS DSMB Liaison.  DSMB 
recommendations need not be generated by [CONTACT_262193], and should include the views of all members if there is disagreement about a particular issue.  The NINDS OCR Director 
will determine if the NINDS concurs with the DSMB’s recommendations.  The NINDS OCR Director or designee will communicate concurrence or not with the study PI.  The NINDS DSMB Liaison will 
provide the DSMB minutes and recommendations to the study PI, along with a memorandum 
documenting: (a) the date of the review; (b) that all relevant interim safety and efficacy data were 
reviewed; (c) recommendations concerning the study execution or modifications to the study 
protocol; and (d) the anticipated date of the next review .  The Principal I nvestigator will promptly 
forward a copy of this memorandum to each participating study investigator for submission to their local IRBs , pursuant to the NIH's Guidance on Reporting Adverse Events to Institutional Review 
Boards for NIH -Supported Multicenter Clinical Trials (release date: June 11, 1999, 
http://gr ants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice- files/not99 -107.html
).  
If the DSMB recommends an amendment to the protocol, it must be approved by [CONTACT_262194], the IRBs and, for IND or IDE studies, the FDA. NINDS concurrence is required 
because some decisions may have significant programmatic implications. For example, a decision to extend the duration of a trial or increase the sample size has implications for the NINDS budget.  
If as a result of interim data monitoring the DSMB determines that a trial: (a)  has answered the 
primary study question; (b) is futile or will not be able to reach a firm conclusion; (c) cannot recruit 
participants within a reasonable timeframe (as determined by [CONTACT_194304]); (d) is not being conducted 
according to high scientific or ethical standards; or (e) poses an unreasonable or unnecessary risk to study participants, the DSMB will recommend to the NINDS representative that the study protocol be 
amended, temporarily suspended, or terminated, as appropriate.  If the NINDS OCR Direct or 
concurs, this recommendation will be conveyed to and discussed with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_262057].  It will be important to ensure that the PI [INVESTIGATOR_262058]'s rationale.  In addition, prior 
to a public announcement of a trial's early termination, a plan should be developed and implemented for notifying the study investigators, the IRBs and the study participants.  When a study is conducted 
under an IND or IDE, the FDA and the involved biopharmaceutical companies or device 
manufacturers must also be notified.  A decision to modify or terminate a trial may influence the conduct of another, similar clinical trial and the NINDS may arrange to debrief that trial's study 
investigators or its DSMB in advance of the public announcement.

 8. Communications from Study Investigators  
Communication with DSMB members will be primarily through the NINDS DSMB Liaison.  Neither 
the investigators nor the DSMB members should directly communicate on any study -related issues 
outside of the DSMB meetings (including protocols, procedure manuals, reports, recommendations).  The study PI [INVESTIGATOR_262059] ( eg, 
recruitment, follow -up, compliance) in order to manage day -to-day study aspects and ensure quality 
contr ol. These data reviews do not involve treatment group comparisons. If in the course of such 
monitoring, the investigator uncovers issues that may threaten the integrity of the study or subject safety ( eg, excessive dropout rate or unexpectedly high rate of  adverse events), he or she should 
alert the NINDS DSMB Liaison who will consult with the DSMB Chair as to whether a special meeting or conference call of the Board should be held. Except as explicitly authorized by [CONTACT_40746], it is critical that study inve stigators will remain blinded to the interim data because knowledge 
of emerging trends between treatment arms may influence participant enrollment, management and 
evaluation, thus compromising the study by [CONTACT_262195].    
In addition, for clinical trials funded in whole or in part by [CONTACT_262196] (regardless of who the official sponsor is), a participating study investigator is obligated to inform the 
NINDS of any significant communication from the FDA concerning the trial, i ncluding warning letters, 
investigator disqualification notices, clinical holds, etc., within [ADDRESS_318840] learning of this FDA 
communication. Formal notification should be made in writing, but initial notification may be done by 
[CONTACT_262197] a written notice would delay the notification. It should include a statement of the action 
taken or contemplated and the assistance needed to resolve the situation. This policy is detailed in the Notice to NIH Grantees/Contractors Regarding Letters or Notices from  the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) (release date: September 22, 2000, http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice -files/NOT -OD-00-053.html
). The NINDS will bring the 
matter to the attention of the DSMB.  
9. Medical Safety Monitor and Safety Monitoring by [CONTACT_262198] -monitored trial have an assigned Medical Safety Monitor 
(MSM) , independent of the study investigators, who is responsible for review of individual serious 
adverse events (SAEs) as they occur, and regular reporting of SAEs to the DSMB and others, as appropriate. Some SMC's may also identify a MSM to review SAEs.  
Each multi -center clinical trial supported by [CONTACT_262199] (MSM), nominated by [CONTACT_262200] (PD). The Med ical Safety Monitor is a 
physician who is not involved in the study and who has no conflict of interest. The Medical Safety 
Monitor is responsible for ongoing monitoring of reports of SAEs submitted by [CONTACT_262201]. The Medical Safety 
Monitor may suggest protocol modifications to prevent the occurrence of particular adverse events, 
eg, modifying the protocol to require frequent measurement of laboratory values predictive of the 
event or to improve expeditious identification of SAEs. To minimize bias, the Medical Safety Monitor will usually evaluate SAEs blinded to treatment assignment, unless the DSMB/SMC approves partial 
or complete unblinding. Specific procedures for Medical Safety Monitor activities will necessarily vary 
from trial to trial in order to protect the safety of participants. For selected trials, the Medical Safety 
Monitor may serve as a resource to the clinical investigators for advice about managemen t of SAEs 
but may not be involved in other aspects of the trial.  
The Medical Safety Monitor will prepare regular reports concerning SAEs (not segregated by 
[CONTACT_1570]) for submission to the principal study investigator, the DSMB and, as appropriate, 
the FDA and collaborating biopharmaceutical companies or device manufacturers. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], such 
Protocol NN102 SPRINT -MS with Amendment 5.[ADDRESS_318841] the principal study investigator and the NINDS Program Director (PD) and if applicable, NINDS DSMB representative, who will notify the DSMB Chair. The DSMB may convene a meeting or t eleconference of the Board to consider the concerns and plan appropriate action.  
The DSMB could consider recommending that the trial go on hold if a clear imbalance in the rates of a serious adverse event emerged between the treatment groups.  The DSMB would discuss whether to recommend that the study should 1) proceed with additional monitoring, 2) proceed with protocol 
modifications, 3) be placed on hold, or 4) should be terminated.  
In the event that the MSM is unavailable for an extended period of time (ie, extended vacation, 
sabbatical, illness, etc.) a back -up MSM will be nominated by [CONTACT_9154] [INVESTIGATOR_262060]. The responsibilities of the MSM are worked out between the Steering Committee and 
DSMB in advance of starting the trial.  
10.  DSMB Review of Study Publications  
 
The DSMB will have the opportunity to review and comment on all study manuscripts and abstracts 
prior to submission.

 PREFACE  
This Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) describes the planned analyses for the NeuroNEXT NN102 
(SPRINT -MS) study  [National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) grant # 
U01NS082329].  The planned analyses identified in this SAP are intended to support the completion 
of the Final Study Report (FSR) and will be included in regulatory submissions and/or future manuscripts.  All interim analyses will involve only the primary study endpoint,  and will be performed 
once the specified number of randomized subjects have completed the full study period.  All final, 
planned analyses identified in this SAP will be performed only after the last randomized subject has 
completed the full study period.  Once all data have been cleaned and verified, a “locked” version of the data will be used for reporting the final study results.  Key statistics and study results will be made available to the Protocol Principal Investigator (PPI) following database lock and prior to completion of the final FSR.   
1. STUDY DESIGN  
This is a multicenter, phase II, randomized, double- blind, placebo controlled, parallel group study 
designed to generate proof -of-concept evidence to evaluate the activity of Ibudilast (MN -166) on 
imaging measures of brain atrophy and tissue integrity, to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Ibudilast over two years, and to identify imaging markers for measuring biologic activities of potential therapi[INVESTIGATOR_261925].   A total of 250 male and female subjects from 21 to 65 years old, 
inclusive, will be enrolled into two treatment groups across sites within the NeuroNEXT network.  Subjects will be randomized in a 1:[ADDRESS_318843] (100 mg/day; n = 125) or matching placebo (n = 125).  Randomization of subjects will be stratified by [CONTACT_20984] [primary progressive MS (PPMS) or secondary progressive MS (SPMS) ] and immunomodulation therapy 
[untreated with long -term MS disease modifying therapy or receiving either glatiramer acetate (GA) or 
interferon beta (IFNβ -1a: Avonex, Rebix or IFNβ -1b: Betaseron, Etavia) treatment].  Study drug will 
be administered either two times per day  (i.e., MN -166 50 mg or placebo taken in the morning and 
evening) or three times per day, depending on subject’s tolerance to study drug.   The study will 
consist of a screening phase (up to 45 days), followed by a treatment phase (96 weeks), and a follow -
up visit ([ADDRESS_318844] week 96 visit).  Thus, subjects  will be involved for approximately [ADDRESS_318845] occur within 45 days following the screening visit.  At the baseline visit (day 1), subjects who have completed all of the screening assessments and continue to meet eligibility criteria will be randomized to one of two treatment groups and will take 3 capsules of study medication on the evening of day 1 .  
On the morning of day 2, all subjects will begin a three capsule BID (twice daily) dosing regimen through day 14.  Subjects randomized to MN -166 will start at 60 mg/day (30 mg BID) and will remain 
on 60 mg/day through day 14.  Beginning on day 15, all subjects will begin a 5 capsule BID regimen; those randomized to MN -166 will therefore be taking 100 mg/day (50 mg BID).  After day 15, subjects 
with intolerable side effects (e.g., nausea, diarrhea, vertigo) may reduce their dose to either 4 capsules twice a day (80 mg/day for those taking MN -166) or 3 capsules twice a day (60 mg/day for 
those taking MN -166).   Subjects with intolerable side effects at the end of day 14 may continue taking 
3 capsules twice a day at the Investigator’s discretion.  At the Investigator’s discretion, the daily dose of Ibudilast can be changed between [ADDRESS_318846] maintain their then- current daily dose of study medication (3 capsules twice per day, 4 
capsules twice per day,  or 5 capsules twice per day) for the duration of the trial.  Additionally, at the

 Investigator’s discretion, the daily dose of Ibudilast may be divided and taken three times per day to 
improve tolerability.  Subjects will return to the clinic for follow -up visits on a regular basis at weeks 4, 
8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, and 96.  All subjects who complete the study on drug will return for a follow -
up safety visit at week 100 ([ADDRESS_318847] study visit) to assess general health and adverse 
event s tatus.  
Subjects who experience a relapse will return to the clinic within three days of notifying the Investigator, and will undergo assessments as described in Table 2 (Schedule of Unplanned Procedures and Assessments) of the study protocol.  
Subjects who prematurely discontinue study medication will continue to be followed on a semi -annual 
basis until the end of the study.  For such subjects, adverse events will not be collected post study drug discontinuation.  Existing AEs will be followed until the AE resolves or stabilizes.  
1.1 Primary Objectives 
Primary Objective #1: Evaluate the activity of Ibudilast (MN -166: 100 mg/day) versus placebo at 
96 weeks as measured by [CONTACT_262202] (BPF).  
Primary Objective #2:  Evaluate the safety and tolerability of Ibudilast (MN -166) versus placebo  
1.2 Major Secondary Objectives 
Major Secondary Objective: Evaluate the activity of I budilast (MN -166) versus placebo as 
measured by:  
(1) Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in descending pyramidal white matter tracts  
(2) Magnetization transfer ration (MTR) imaging in normal -appearing brain tissue  
(3) Retinal nerve fiber layer thickness as measured by [CONTACT_262121] (OCT)  
(4) Cortical atrophy as measured by [CONTACT_262084] (CLADA)  
Brain MRI will be performed in a standard fashion, as outlined in the MRI procedure manual.  Each subject’s baseline MRI must be approved by [CONTACT_262135].  All sites will perform a test (or “dummy”) MRI scan prior to study initiation.  This test MRI will ensure adequate 
performance of the study MRI.  It is required that the same MRI scanner be used to acquire all MRI scans over the course of the study.  If during the study  period a study site needs to change the MRI 
scanner or the current MRI scanner undergoes significant upgrades (hardware or software), the investigator should notify the Clinical Coordinating Center  (CCC) .  For all changes in scanner and 
significant scanner upgrades, the investigator will be requested to obtain MRI scans of 3 volunteers 
acquired prior to changing/upgrading the MRI scanner and the same 3 volunteers again after 
changing scanners (a total of 6 scans).  The site will be allowed to acquire trial  subject scans on the 
new scanner only after obtaining approval of the new or upgraded scanner.  Data will be captured in the study database flagging that a major scanner change/upgrade has occurred.  However, all primary and secondary analyses will not attempt to adjust for the scanner change.  
2. PRIMARY ENDPOINTS  
2.1. Brain Parenchymal  Fraction (BPF)  
Using computerized image analysis software, brain volume loss is detectable at all stages of disease (Miller et al, 2002; Bermel & Bakshi, 2006).  Atrophy is an indirect marker of destructive pathologic processes in MS, including the net effects of focal tissue damage in white matter and grey matter, but also diffuse pathologic processes in normal -appearing brain tissue.  More than 20 studies show

 significant cross- sectional correlations between whole brain atrophy and overall clinical disability 
(Fisher, 2011a; Fisher, 2011b).  Whole brain atrophy (WBA) also correlates with cognitive impairment 
(Edwards et al, 2001; Rao et al, 1985; Hohol et al, 1997; Benedict et al, 2004; Lazeron et al, 2005), depression (Feinstein et al, 2004), fatigue (Marrie et al, 2005; Tedeschi et al, 2007), and quality of life (Janardhan & Bakshi, 2000; Rudick et al, 2001).  Multivariate analysis suggests that disabil ity 
correlates better with WBA than with lesion measures (Benedict et al, 2004).  WBA progresses over the course of MS, with a mean rate in untreated MS patients generally ranging from 0.5- 1.5% per 
year (Fisher, 2011b).  Although one small (n=21) early study found atrophy to slow in later disease (Fox et al, 2000), contemporary studies with larger sample sizes (n=69 and n=963) found similar or faster rates of atrophy in PMS compared with RRMS (Fisher et al, 2008; De Stefano et al, 2010).  Atrophy progression in PPMS is similar to SPMS (Kalkers et al, 2001).  Longitudinal studies found patients with greater rates of atrophy are more likely to worsen clinically (Dastidar et al, 1999; Molyneux et al, 2000; Fisher et al, 2000; Fisher et al, 2002; Dalton et al, 2 004; Minneboo et al, 2008; 
Di Fillippo et al, 2010).  For example, a longitudinal study found WBA progression is predictive of cognitive deterioration (Amato et al, 2007).  These clinical correlations appear to be stronger later in the disease (i.e., SPMS compared to RRMS – Fisher et al, 2000; Ge et al, 2000).  Altogether 
although additional treatment trial data is needed, face validity, concurrent validity, and predictive validity of WBA in PMS are significant enough to use it as the primary outcome metric  in PMS trials.  
Based on accumulated evidence, an international consensus panel recommended WBA as the primary outcome of phase II PMS trials (Barkhof et al, 2009).  Indeed, several recent PMS studies used WBA as the primary outcome, including trials evaluating lamotrigine (Huang et al, 2002) and simvastatin (Chataway et al, 2012).  For currently available RRMS therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], the treatment effects on atrophy range from 30% -50% compared to placebo, including a 34% slowing of atrophy in a phase II 
trial of Ibudilast in RRMS (Barkhof et al, 2010) and a 49% slowing over 2 years with simvastatin in 
SPMS (Chataway et al, 2012).  
The primary outcome of this trial is WBA, estimated as the change in brain parenchymal fraction 
(BPF).   BPF is a normalized measure of whole brain volume calculated as the volume of brain 
parenchymal tissue divided by [CONTACT_262203] a smoothed outer surface of the brain (Rudick et al, 1999).  The fully -automated algorithm takes partial volume effects into account, can utilize either 
FLAIR or dual echo PD -/T2-weighted images, and has a scan- rescan coefficient of variability < 0.2%.  
Sensitivity analyses for BPF include SIENA and an advanced SIENA technique that utilizes a single longitudinally co- registered image within each patient, which may further reduce variability.  
For the purposes of this trial, BPF will be computed based on MRI scans performed at screening, and at weeks 24, 48, 72, and 96.  The images will be processed, and reviewed for quality and completeness at the Cleveland Clinic MS MRI Analysis Center.  Images will be checked for adherence to protocol, consistency over time, image quality, and completeness of the electronic transfer.  This step determines if the MRI data set can be approved for BPF analysis or if it should be  
rejected, reacquired, or resent from NeuroRx.  Once approved, the images will be set up to be analyzed.  The image analysis pi[INVESTIGATOR_262064].  Database records for which the atrophy results have been visually verified will be 
transmitted to the NeuroNEXT Data Coordinating Center  (DCC)  in accordance with the procedures 
outlined in the corresponding data transfer agreement.

 2.2. Safety  
The primary assessment of safety will compare the percentage of subjects in each group with:  
• Treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs)  
• Treatment -emergent serious adverse events (TESAEs)  
For the purposes of this study, a treatment -emergent adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical 
occurrence in a study subject who was administered a medicinal (investigational) product and which 
does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including a significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal (investigational) product.  Adverse events may include the onset of a new illness and the exacerbat ion of pre- existing conditions.  Other untoward events occurring in 
the framework of a clinical study are also to be recorded as AEs (e.g., those occurring during treatment -free periods, including screening or post -treatment follow -up periods), in association with 
study -related procedures and assessments or under placebo.  
One of the following categories should be selected based on medical judgment, considering the definitions below and all contributing factors:  
• Related : A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, occurs in a plausible time 
relationship to treatment administration, and which cannot be explained by [CONTACT_262150].  The response to withdrawal of the treatment (de-challenge) should be clinically  plausible.  The event must be definitive 
pharmacologically or phenomenologically, using a satisfactory re- challenge procedure if 
necessary.  
• Probably Related: A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, occurs within a 
reasonable time sequence to administration of the treatment, unlikely to be attributed to 
concurrent disease or other medications or chemicals, and which follows a clinically 
reasonable response on withdrawal (dechallenge).  Re- challenge information is not 
required to fulfill thi s definition.  
• Possibly Related: A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, occurs within a 
reasonable time sequence to administration of the treatment, but which could also be 
explained by [CONTACT_262150].   Information on 
treatment withdrawal may be lacking or unclear.  
• Unlikely to be Related: A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, occurs with a 
temporal relationship to treatment administration that makes a causal relationship improbable, and in which other medications, chemicals, or underlying disease provide 
plausible explanations.  
• Unrelated : A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, occurs with little or no 
temporal relationship with treatment administration.  May have negative dechallenge and re-challenge information. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_261969] (e.g., concomitant 
disease, environmental factors, or other medications or chemicals).  
For the purposes of this study, primary interest involves an examination of treatmed -related AEs - 
defined as any AE deemed to be at least possibly related to study treatment.  As this is a double- blind 
study, the causality assessment should be made under the assumption that the subject is receiving

 active study medication.  If considering unblinding, this assessment should be made prior to 
unblinding to avoid bias.  
An AE is considered serious if it meets one or more of the following criteria:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening (i.e., a subject is at immediate risk of death at the time of the event, not 
an event where occurrence in a more severe form might have caused death)  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapaci ty 
• Results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Is another important medical event  
Important medical events that do not result in death, are not life- threatening, or do not require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_37347], based on appropriate medical j udgment, they may 
jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  
[CONTACT_262239] will serve as the Medical Safety Monitor (MSM)  for this trial.  [CONTACT_262240] will work 
closely with the DCC, and will use the online AE reporting system to review all reported SAEs in near 
real time and evaluate them to identify the need for timely intervention.  For any reported SAEs, an automatic email will be sent to [CONTACT_262240] to prompt a review of the event for determination of 
whether the event is unanticipated and/or whether it is related to study drug.  With the assistance of the coordinators at the DCC, [CONTACT_262240] has the option of requesting additional information about any SAE.  He will complete  a form for each review, and this information will be entered into the online 
data entry system.  
Thus, in summary, the determination of whether an AE or SAE is treatment -related (at least possibly 
related to treatment) differs.  Because the MSM only reviews SAEs in real -time, the determination of 
whether or not a non- serious AE is considered treatment -related will be made at the site level.  
However, for SAEs, the MSM determination of whether or not an SAE is treatment -related  will take 
precedent over the classification at the site level.  
2.3. Tolerability  
The primary assessment of tolerability will compare the percentage of subjects in each group who:  
• Discontinue treatment early (early study termination and/or early study drug  withdrawal) due to 
treatment -emergent AEs or SAEs  
• Discontinue treatment early (early study termination and/or early study drug withdrawal) for any reason  
3. MAJOR SECONDARY ENDPOINTS  
3.1. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI)  
Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) quantifies the magnitude and direction of water diffusion.  Areas of tissue injury have altered diffusion, thus offering a quantitative, dynamic measure of tissue integrity.  The four common DTI metrics that describe water diffusion are axial diffusivity ( λ
‖, diffusion along the 
length of a fiber tract), radial diffusivity (λ ┴, diffusion across the breadth), mean diffusivity (MD, overall 
measure of diffusion), and fractional anisotropy (FA, degree of anisotropy of diffusion – Molyneux et

 al, 2000; Fisher et  al, 2000).  Several animal and human studies suggest that λ ‖ roughly reflects 
axonal integrity and λ ┴ roughly reflects myelin integrity (Song et al, 2002; Song et al, 2003; Song et al, 
2005).  D TI measures correlate with disability (Dalton et al, 2004; Amato et al, 2007).  A longitudinal 
study of MS patients showed an increase in FA within acute MS lesions during recovery, with a 
concomitant decrease in λ ┴ suggestive of possible remyelination (Fox et al, 2011).  Furthermore, the 
magnitude of λ ┴ as baseline predicted the evolution of lesions into T1 black holes (areas with more 
significant tissue injury) at 1 year (Fox et al, 2011).  DTI is performed differently by [CONTACT_262204], which can yield different DTI values.  However, with careful attention to pulse sequence implementation, we have demonstrated the ability to standardize image acquisition to yield DTI images with very similar values (Fox et al, 2012; Magnotta et al, 2012).  
The DTI images will be  processed at the Cleveland Clinic Mellen Center Research MRI Laboratory 
(Director: Mark Lowe).  The images will be reviewed for quality and completeness as they are received by [CONTACT_38768].  Images will be checked for adherence to protocol, image quality, and completeness of the electronic transfer.  This step determines if the MRI dataset can be approved for 
DTI analysis or if it should be rejected, reacquired, or resent from NeuroRx.  Once approved, the images will be analyzed.  The image analysis pi[INVESTIGATOR_262065] a comma separated value (csv) text file.  Cumulative results will be transmitted to the NeuroNEXT DCC in accordance with the procedures outlined in the corresponding data transfer agreement.  
Based on this information, there will be two DTI outcomes under con sideration , both measured 
separately on the left and right side: 
• Axial Diffusivity  (LD) 
• Radial Diffusivity  (TD) 
3.2. Magnetization Transfer Ratio (MTR) 
Magnetization transfer (MT) imaging is an indirect study of semi -solid tissue components such as cell 
membranes, whose T2 relaxation times are too short to be imaged directly (Hohol et al, 1997; Benedict et al, 2004).  The MT effect is usually quantified by [CONTACT_262205] -by-voxel maps of the 
percent decrease in signal between images with and without MT  pulse, thus producing a MTR image 
(Fillippi & Grossman, 2002).  Decreased MTR correlates strongly with loss of myelin and axons within lesions are more pronounced in NAWM in SPMS (Feinstein et al, 2004; Marrie et al, 2005), and correlate with disability (Tedeschi et al, 2007).  MTR is also abnormal in normal -appearing grey 
matter (NAGM) in MS ( Ge et al, 2002; Fisniku et al, 2009; Fillippi [CONTACT_2297], 2011), and recent 
MR/pathology correlation studies show that MTR can detect cortical demyelination (Chen et al, 2013 ).  
These findings suggest that whole- brain normal -appearing brain tissue (NABT) and gray matter MTR 
may be useful biomarkers of tissue damage in trials of neuroprotective therapi[INVESTIGATOR_262066].  
A number of small, single -center studies of MS therapi[INVESTIGATOR_262067].  But, relatively few 
multi- center studies have done so, presumably because of the added complexity of standardizing 
acquisition protocols and performing a robust centralized analysis.  Two randomized, placebo-controlled multi -center studies in SPMS (interferon beta- 1b and IVIG) demonstrated annual changes 
in whole- brain measures of MTR of about 2.5% -3.5% in their respective placebo groups (Inglese et 
al, 2003; Fillippi [CONTACT_2297], 2004).  While neither study showed a benefit of treatment on MTR,  the 
magnitude of change over time suggests that detecting a treatment effect on MTR for a neuroprotective agent in SPMS is feasible.  The recent DEFINE BG -12 phase III trial in RRMS 
(analyzed by [CONTACT_262206]) included MTR imaging in 64 sites, with n=126- 135 per treatment group.  
Using a similar sample size to our proposed study, a significant benefit on both whole- brain and

 NABT MTR was seen in patients treated with BG -12 relative to placebo (Arnold et al, 2014).  These 
results, combined with the ability to implement MTR imaging on most modern scanners with whole-
brain coverage, high resolution, and high signal -to-noise ratio (SNR), suggest that MTR is both 
feasible and useful to deploy in a multi -center trial in progressive MS (Dastidar et al, 1999; Kalkers et 
al, 2001; De Stefano et al, 2010).  
The MTR data will be transmitted to the NeuroNEXT DCC directly from NeuroRX in accordance with the procedures outlined in the corresponding data transfer agreement.  
Based on this information, there will be two MTR outcomes under consideration:  
• Median MTR in normal appearing brain tissue (NABT)  
• Median MTR in normal appearing grey matter (NAGM)  
3.3. Optical Coherence Tomography  
Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) non- invasively uses near -infrared light to measure the 
thickness of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and macular ganglion cell layer (GCL), which comprise first -order sensory neurons for the visual pathway.  Both RNFL and GCL decline 
proportional to disease progression in MS (even in the absence of overt visual systems, signs, or symptoms – Rudick et al, 1999) and brain atrophy (Gordon- Lipkin et al, 2007).  OCT metrics correlate 
strongly with visual function (Walter et  al, 2012) and patient -reported quality of life in MS (Mowry et al, 
2009).  Being able to selectively quantify the contributions of unmyelinated axonal (peripherally RNFL) vs. neuronal (macular GCL) pathology has substantial relevance for understanding the pathological processes in MS (Waxman & Black, 2007).  Analogous to MRI, data from different OCT platforms are not equivalent; however, the change in RNFL thickness from the two main study OCT platforms (Zeiss Cirrus and Heidelberg Spectralis) can be combined in a clinical trial (Waxman et al, 2011).  In summary, OCT may represent a simple, quick, non- invasive, and relatively inexpensive 
method to assess neurodegeneration and the potential benefit of putative neuroprotective therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
The OCT data will be transmitted to the NeuroNEXT DCC from the Digital Angiography Reading Center (DARC) lab in accordance with the procedures outlined in the corresponding data transfer 
agreement.   For each subject, there is one record per eye.  
For the purposes of this trial,  the analysis will focus on a comparison of the mean retinal nerve fiber 
layer (RNFL)  thickness.   All subjects are assessed by [CONTACT_5640] a Spectralis or Cirrus machine.   For each 
machine, three separate measurements are obtained – unless the first two readings differ by [CONTACT_26813] 7.5%, in which case an additional reading is taken.  The mean RNFL thickness (within each eye) is defined as the mean of the two variables that are closest to one another.  
3.4. Cortical Longitudinal Atrophy Detection Algorithm (CLADA ) 
Additional atrophy measures include GM atrophy, which will be measured using two different approaches – GM faction (GMF) and cortical thickness (CTh).  Cortical thickness  is measured at each 
time point using CLADA, a longitudinal algorithm based on deformation of a patient -specific cortical 
model (Nakamura et al, 2011) , and will be considered as an additional major secondary endpoint for 
this study .  The cortical model is generated from longitudinal T1- weighted MPRAGE images.  The 
point correspondence that define the distance between the inner and outer cortical surfaces are maintained throughout, leading to greater reproducibility.  Change in CTh is calculated as the slope in CTh over time, with a scan- rescan variability of 0.45%.  
The CTh data will be processed at the Cleveland Clinic MS MRI Analysis Center, and will part of the

[ADDRESS_318848] been received, the other atrophy measurements, GMF and CTh, will be measured and verified.  
4. ENROLLMENT & RANDOMIZATION  
Following the screening phase, subjects  who continue to meet entry criteria will be enrolled and 
randomly assigned in a 1:1 manner to one of two treatment groups: MN -166 100 mg/d or matching 
placebo.  A total of approximately 250 subjects will be randomized into the study.  Randomization of 
subjects will be stratified by [CONTACT_262207]  [untreated with long -term MS disease 
modifying therapy (DMT) vs. those receiving either glatiramer acetate (GA) or interferon beta (IFNβ -
1a – Avonex, Rebif, or IFNβ -1b – Betaseron, Etavia)] , and disease status [primary progressive MS 
(PPMS ) vs. secondary progressive MS ( SPMS) ].  The NeuroNEXT DCC will generate a 
randomization table for each of the strata using a permuted block design with random block sizes.  
5. PRELIMINARY TABULTIONS  
All subjects who provide informed consent will be accounted for in this study.  Regularly generated 
enrollment reports will describe:  
• Number of subjects consented, eligible, and randomized by [CONTACT_3725]  
• Ongoing study status of all randomized subjects  
• Reasons for ineligibility  
• Protocol deviations  
• Early drug withdrawals  
• Early study terminations  
Subject data will also be summarized by [CONTACT_1570] (MN -166 vs. placebo) with respect to 
important demographic characteristics.  Distribution of categorical variables will be tabulated by [CONTACT_1570].  Continuous variables will be summarized as mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum by [CONTACT_6654].  Variables to be collected will include:  
• Gender  
• Race  
• Ethnicity  
• Age 
• Participation in lumbe r puncture study  
• T2 lesion volume (CCs) at screening  
6. ANALYSIS POPULATIONS  
Due to the exploratory nature of this study, all analyses to address the primary and major secondary objectives will be conducted at the 0.[ADDRESS_318849] will differ depending on the objectives of any particular analysis.

 6.1. Primary and Major Secondary Efficacy Analyses  
6.1.1. Modified Intent -to-Treat (mITT) Population 
The primary analysis for all primary and major secondary efficac y objectives will be implemented 
using a modified intent -to-treat (mITT) approach, which is defined as all subjects who are: 
• Randomized  
• Received at least one dose of study medication  
• Have at least one efficacy assessment (i.e., week 24, 48, 72, or 96 visit) during the double -
blind phase of the study  
All subjects meeting this criteria will be analyzed based on the treatment to which they were 
randomized, whether or not they remained compliant with respect to taking study medication.  
6.1.2. Per Protocol (PP) Population:   
To assess the sensitivity of the results, and to obtain knowledge regarding the potential effects when the protocol was strictly adhered to, we will also replicate all primary and major secondary efficacy 
objectives using a per protocol population.  The per -protocol population includes the subset of all 
mITT subjects who satisfy both of the following conditions:  
• Have 75% -125% compliance ( both limit values inclusive ) with assigned study medication as 
randomized in the double- blind phase  
• Have no major protocol deviations  (defined as any alteration/modification to the protocol that 
has the potential to negatively impact subject safety, integrity of the study, ability to draw conclusions from the study data, or affect the subject’s willingness to participate in the study)  
6.2. Safety/Tolerability Population  
All safety/tolerability analyses will be implemented using an intent -to-treat approach, which is defined 
as all subjects who are randomized and receive at least one dose of study medicatio n. 
7. PRIMARY ANALYSES  
7.1. Primary Objective #1: Evaluate the activity of I budilast (MN -166: 100 mg/day) versus placebo at 
96 weeks as measured by [CONTACT_262202] (BPF).  
The first primary objective of the proposed study is to evaluate the activity of Ibudilast ( MN-166) 
versus placebo by [CONTACT_262208] ( BPF) 
between the Ibudilast and placebo treatment groups  as meas ured at baseline, weeks 24, 48, and [ADDRESS_318850] of the null hypothesis that the 
BPF rates of change in the treatment and placebo groups are equal.  
The raw data will be summarized graphically, and in the following table:

The null hypothesis can be evaluated based on an assessment of parameter estimates from a linear 
mixed model (LMM: Laird and Ware, 1982).  LMMs are advantageous for longitudinal clinical trials because they can account  for dependency due to repeated measures with relatively few parameters, 
which potentially enhances statistical efficiency.  Furthermore, LMMs can accommodate incomplete cases (i.e., missing data), which is expected in this study due to dropout.  LMMs are typi[INVESTIGATOR_261985] (Verbeke and Molenberghs, 2000) that yield valid inferences with incomplete cases under the widely applicable assumption that the missing data are ignorable (Little and Rubin, 2002).  
For this analysis, assuming linear change over time, the LMM can be written in the following manner :

Assuming a common intercept constrains the baseline means to be equal, which controls for any

The main parameters  of interest are β [ADDRESS_318858]:  
H0: θ1 = β4 - β 3 = [ADDRESS_318859] the alternative  
H1: θ1 ≠ 0. 
This null hypothesis can be evaluated with the likelihood ratio test, or a Z -test, provided a sufficiently 
large sample size which is provided in the proposed study.  The Z statistic of interest is:  
𝑍𝑍=𝜃𝜃�1/𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆�𝜃𝜃�1� , 
and leads to the rejection of H 0 when  
|𝑍𝑍|<𝑍𝑍1−𝛼𝛼 /2 
with the latter being the 100(1- α/2)th quartile of the standard normal distribution.  
If we fail to reject H 0, then we will conclude that there is no significant difference in the change of BPF 
between the treatment group and the placebo group over [ADDRESS_318860] the null hypothesis does not 
imply acceptance of the null hypothesis of no difference in slopes over time for the two groups.

 72, and 96 weeks), there is a possibility that the BPF trajectories will not be linear.   In order to assess 
the sensitivity of the results to the assumption of linearity, non- linear trends will be modeled by 
[CONTACT_262210] a categorical variable.  For this modelling approach, visits that were performed 
outside of an expected scheduled visit will be categorized into the next expected scheduled visit.  We 
will compare model fit between the non- linear and linear models using the AIC, and will report results 
from the non- linear model if the AIC suggests that the nonlinear model provides  a better fit.  In this 
case, the primary comparison will involve a comparison of the estimated means of the two groups at each time  point, and will be displayed in a table similar to the following:

The residuals of the fitted statistical models will be examined for evidence of departure from assumptions, such as normality.  If assumptions appear to be grossly violated, then transformations of response variables might  be considered.  It is also possible that some baseline characteristics will 
be imbalanced between the two treatment groups.  In this case, the model may be expanded to include adjustments for the imbalanced characteristics.  As specified in section 6, the primary 
analysis
 will be conducted using a modified intent -to-treat analysis, which includes all subjects who 
are randomized, receive at least one dose of study medication, and have at least one efficacy 
assessment in the double- blind phase. 
Finally, 
the proposed study involves multiple sites, which is a potential source of additional variation.  
Patients within a site tend to be correlated due to similarity of environment, e.g. because of testing by [CONTACT_262154] (Localio et al, 2001).   Sensitivity analyses may also be conducted to 
account for site variation by [CONTACT_262211].  
7.2. Primary Objective #2:  Evaluate the safety and tolerability of Ibudilast (MN -166) versus placebo  
7.2.1 Safety  
The primary assessment of safety will compare the percentage of subjects in each group with:  
• Treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs)  
• Treatment -emergent serious adverse events (TESAEs)

[ADDRESS_318861], the percentage of subjects who experience any 
treatment -related AE in each group will be compared using the following logistic regression model:  
logit (𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖)=𝛽𝛽0+𝛽𝛽1𝑥𝑥1𝑖𝑖+𝛽𝛽2𝑥𝑥2𝑖𝑖+𝛽𝛽3𝑥𝑥3𝑖𝑖+𝜖𝜖𝑖𝑖 
where  
• Y i represents an indicator of whether or not ith subject had at least one treatment related AE.  
• x 1i = [ADDRESS_318862] was thought to be receiving immunomodulation therapy at randomization 
        (IFN/GA), and [ADDRESS_318863] was not thought to be receiving immunomodulation therapy  
• x 2i = [ADDRESS_318864] secondary progressive MS  
• x 3i = [ADDRESS_318865] was randomized 
        to placebo group 
• 𝜖𝜖𝑖𝑖 is random error for the 𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡ℎ subject  
To determine if the percentage of subjects having any treatment related AEs differ across treatment 
group we will test the following hypothesis:  
Ho: β3 = 0 vs. H A: β3 ≠ 0 
If the null hypothesis is rejected,  and β3 > 0, we will conclude that Ibudilast was responsible for a 
significantly greater frequency of treatment -related AEs.  Similarly, if β3 < 0, we will conclude that 
Ibudilast was responsible for a significantly lower frequency of treatment -related AEs.  In addition to 
an overall comparison, this hypothesis will be repeated for assessing the percentage of subjects 
having at least one treatment -related AE within each MedDRA system organ class  (SOC).  If there 
are significant differences between groups within any specific SOC , then additional tests will compare 
differences across groups for specific MedDRA preferred terms in order to further explore the cause of the observed differences.  
In addition to the comparison of percentages in the manner described above, the rates of treatment -
related AEs in each group will be compared us ing the following Poisson regression model:  
log�𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖
𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖�=𝛽𝛽0+𝛽𝛽1𝑥𝑥1𝑖𝑖+𝛽𝛽2𝑥𝑥2𝑖𝑖+𝛽𝛽3𝑥𝑥3𝑖𝑖+𝜖𝜖𝑖𝑖 
where  
• Y i represents the number of treatment related SAEs experienced by [CONTACT_941] 𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡ℎ subject.  
• T i represents the number of months between the date of randomization and the date of last 
follow -up for the ith subject.  
• x 1i = [ADDRESS_318866] was thought to be receiving immunomodulation therapy at randomization 
        (IFN/GA), and [ADDRESS_318867] was not thought to be receiving immunomodulation therapy  
• x 2i = [ADDRESS_318868] secondary progressive MS  
• x 3i = [ADDRESS_318869] was randomized 
        to placebo group  
• 𝜖𝜖𝑖𝑖 is random error for the 𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡ℎ subject

[ADDRESS_318870] the 
following hypothesis:  
Ho: β3 = 0 vs. H A: β3 ≠ [ADDRESS_318871].  
Values of β 3 > [ADDRESS_318872] 
group, while values of β 3 < [ADDRESS_318873] group.  
Treatment -related SAEs will be analyzed in the same manner described above.  Additional safety 
analyses will also assess all treatment -emergent AEs, treatment -emergent SAEs, unanticipated 
SAEs, and treatment -related & unanticipated SAEs in a similar manner.  
7.2.2 To lerability  
The assessment of tolerability will involve assessing the percentage of subjects in each group who:  
• Discontinue treatment early (early study termination and/or early study drug withdrawal) due to 
treatment -emergent AEs  or SAEs  
• Discontinue treatment early (early study termination and/or early study drug withdrawal) for any reason  
Both will be assessed using a model similar to that described in section 7.2.[ADDRESS_318874] at 96 
weeks versus placebo using a variety of additional imaging metrics.  Four separate imaging metrics 
will be considered.  
• Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in descending pyramidal white matter tracts  
• Magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) imaging in normal -appearing brain tissue  
• Retinal nerve fiber layer as measured by [CONTACT_7349] (OCT)  
• Cortical atrophy as measured by [CONTACT_262212]

(NABT) and Median MTR in normal appearing grey matter (NAGM)] record the values at each of the

where:  
• Yij is the change in the MTR value from baseline for the ith subject at the jth time point  
• x 1i = the baseline MTR value for the ith subject  
and all other variables are defined in the same manner as described for the model in section 7.1.  The 
major secondary hypothesis of interest will involve a comparison of the β 3 and β 4 parameters, and will 
proceed in the same manner as described for the model in section 7.1.

represent the cortical thickness values.  
8.5. Additional Secondary, Tertiary , and Explorator y Analyses 
A number of additional secondary, tertiary , and exploratory analyses are also planned, but will not be 
included as part of the FSR.  These additional analyses include, but are not limited to:

9. SAMPLE SIZE JUSTIFICATION  
9.1. Primary Objective #1: Evaluate the activity of I budilast (MN -166: 100 mg/day) versus placebo at 
96 weeks as measured by [CONTACT_262220] (BPF).  
Estimated required sample size for the primary objective was computed based on two pi[INVESTIGATOR_261990]. The first pi[INVESTIGATOR_232879] (DS1) consisted of N = 30 PP subjects (n=15 female; 
mean age 58.6 years; mean disease duration 7.3 years; mean EDSS 4.97) who participated in the placebo arm of a clinical trial for the chemotherapy drug mitoxantrone (Kita et al 2004). A maximum of three repeated measures were available, collected over 24 months.  
The second pi[INVESTIGATOR_232879] (DS2) consisted of N = [ADDRESS_318877] size for the power analysis was defined as the percentage difference in linear slope 
relative to a hypothetical treatment group. That is, the percentage reduction in linear deterioration of 
the treated group in a hypothetical intervention. The pi[INVESTIGATOR_261991] (Altmann et al 2009) suggested a reasonable range of percentage difference was 30% to 50%. Also of note, an earlier study was performed assessing the activity of Ibudilast in relapsing MS, and this study included measurement of brain atrophy. While the earlier study used a different atrophy measure (SIENA) than in this proposal (BPF), and had only two time points, it did show effects sizes of approximately 33% -
36%, (Barkhof et al 2010) w hich could be considered an appropriate target for the power analysis.  
Power calculations were based on a LMM appropriate for clinical trials (Yi and Panzarella, 2002; Heo 
and Leon, 2009). Because there was only one site for the pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299], the LMM of Equation (1) was used as the basis for the power analysis. Presentation of the required sample size equations is facilitated by [CONTACT_262157]. Consider the following equalities for the parameters of the 
primary model described in section 7.1:

 (Recall that γ = 0 to constrain the groups to be equal at baseline.) Then the LMM of Equation (1) can 
be written in matrix notation as  
𝒀𝒀𝑖𝑖=𝑿𝑿𝑖𝑖𝜷𝜷+𝒁𝒁𝑖𝑖𝒃𝒃𝑖𝑖+𝝐𝝐𝑖𝑖, 
where each matrix has row dimension ni; Xi is the design matrix of the fixed effects, and Zi is the 
design matrix for the random effects. Xi has four columns, the first being a vector of 1s, the second 
being tij, the third being gi, and the fourth being tij ⋅ gi. Zi consists of the first two columns of Xi.  
The required sample size depends on the variance of the responses,  
𝑽𝑽𝑖𝑖=𝑉𝑉𝑎𝑎𝑉𝑉(𝒀𝒀𝑖𝑖)=𝒁𝒁𝑖𝑖𝑮𝑮𝒁𝒁𝑖𝑖𝑇𝑇+𝜎𝜎2𝑰𝑰𝑖𝑖

where XP is the design matrix for the placebo group, XT is the design matrix for the treatment group, 
and the subscript (4,4) indicates the element in the 4th row and 4th column of the matrix. The value of 
δ is varied to represent effect sizes of 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, and 50%, which is the hypothetical 
slope difference between the treatment and placebo groups.  
The analysis used the proposed time points of 0, 24, 48, 72, and 96 weeks. Power curves were 
computed for DS1, DS2, and for their average (Avg). Avg was based on averaging the LMM parameter estimates across the data sets ( e.g., average slope = [DS1 slope + DS2 slope] / 2). Avg 
was an attempt to pool information from the two data sets without the raw data (the raw data for DS2 
was unavailable). A 10% dropout rate was assumed and all estimated sample sizes were inflated by 
[CONTACT_262158] ( i.e., final sample size = initial sample size × 1.10). Given the resources required for 
obtaining and analyzing 3T scans, the type I error rate was set at α = 0.10. Figure 7.[ADDRESS_318878] sizes (30%, 35%, and 40 %). Focusing on Avg for the middle effect 
size (35%), the figure indicates that a single- arm N / 2 = 125 provides close to 80% (power = 0.80 is 
the horizontal dashed line). The middle effect size is important as it nearly corresponds to the upper 
effect si ze of the aforementioned Ibudilast study (effect size = 36%). The Avg data source is preferr ed 
because it approximates a pooling of the information from both samples. The feasibility of N / 2 = [ADDRESS_318879] sizes with α = 0.10 for all 
three data sources (DS1, DS2, Avg). The power by [CONTACT_262221] 7.2.  The figure clearly shows that the study has adequate power across the range of possible 
values suggested by [CONTACT_233197]. For the “best” data (DS1), our study has slightly less than 90% power to detect effects of approximately 40% or larger, and more than 90% power to detect effects on the upper end of the range of interest (50%). Most importantly, the figure shows that the power based on the Avg data source is very high for effects in the 33% - 36% range of greatest 
interest (approximately 80% - 85%). Therefore, based on these assumptions, we are confident that a 
per-arm sample size of N / 2 = 125 ( N = 250 total participants) is sufficient to help ensure statistically 
reliable results for  the proposed study.

With an overall significance level of 0.10, the study will have 80% or greater power to detect

 where Φ[⋅] is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution. Estimate d power 
was calculated using Equation (3) for the δ effect sizes discussed previously. The results show that 
the estimated power was greater than 0.[ADDRESS_318881] size (30% difference in slopes). 
This result implies that N = [ADDRESS_318882] sizes that is anticipated in the proposed study.  
9.4. Major Secondary Objective (b): Evaluate th e activity of Ibudilast (MN -166) versus placebo as 
measured by [CONTACT_262213] (MTR) imaging in normal appearing brain tissue.  
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_262071]. Descriptive statistics were provided by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Douglas Arnold (Director of NeuroRx) for a study of the efficacy of BG -12 (BG00012, dimethyl 
fumarate), which is a novel therapy in the development for relapsing MS. Ibudilast is purported to have neuroprotective effects, and so these data were used as a model to projec t the power of 
Ibudilast in this proposed trial. A total of N =448 MS patients had whole- brain MTR measured at 
baseline, 24 weeks, 1 year, and 2 years as part of a multi -center phase III clinical trial using 1.5T 
MRIs and the stock manufacturer pulse sequence. Only descriptive statistics were available for change between baseline and two years. There was a placebo group and two treatment groups, one receiving BG -12 240 mg twice a day (b.i.d.) and the second receiving BG -12 240 mg three times per 
day (t.i.d.). The statistics available for the study were means of change scores and their standard deviations. Thus, power was estimated based on an independent t-test of the mean baseline to 2 
year difference in MTR scores for the treatment (BG -12) and placebo groups.  Power was computed 
using the conventional formula  
1−𝛽𝛽 =Φ�|𝛿𝛿|√125
𝜎𝜎−𝑍𝑍1−𝛼𝛼

where δ is the difference of the mean change scores and σ2 is the pooled variance of the difference. 
A subset of patients had no new or enlarging T2 legions, and the analysis was performed twice: once for all the patients and another time excluding the patients with no lesions. The results of the power analysis are shown in the table below. As seen in the table, the lowest estimated power (t.i.d., all patients) was greater than the conventional cut -off of 0.80. When only subjects with no new lesions 
were considered (which more closely approximates what we expect in the proposed trial), estimated power was even greater than the conventional level. The table suggests that N =[ADDRESS_318883] T and P differences in change over time for the proposed study. The 
improved image acquisition from  3T MRIs and tailored pulse sequences are expected to increase the 
study power.

The three levels of nesting represented by [INVESTIGATOR_8850] (4) (month nested within eye nested within patient) presents a challenge for deriving power equations, and analytic results are usually based on simplifying assumptions ( e.g., fewer random effects than in Equation (4)) (Heo and Leon, 2009). In 
order to base the power estimate on the LMM of Equation (4), a simulation approach was used. For the simulation, the LMM of Equation (4) was fit to the pi[INVESTIGATOR_262072]. For each replication, a random number generator was used to compute random effects and random error for N = 250 hypothetical treatment and control 
patients based on the appropriate covariance structures ( e.g., G). Then simulated OCT response 
values were computed based on the fixed and random effects and random error of Equation (4). For

 9.6. Major Secondary Objective (d): Evaluate the activity of I budilast (MN -166) versus placebo as  
measured by [CONTACT_262215], as measured by [CONTACT_262084].  
No pi[INVESTIGATOR_262073]. However, we expect CLADA 
effects to be consistent with those of the other secondary endpoints. Therefore, we are confident that statistical power for CLADA will be sufficient to detect effect sizes similar to those discussed for the other secondary endpoints.  
10. SAFETY MONITORING  
10.1. Assessment & Recording of Adverse Events 
The clinical study site PI ( CSSPI ) or an authorized physician will assess all AEs for severity, 
relationship with study medication, and whether it meets the criteria for classification as an SAE, requiring immediate notification to the Sponsor or designee.  These assessments will be made in accordance with the standard ratings detailed in the following sections.  Each CSSPI [INVESTIGATOR_262074] (AERS).  
Adverse events should be collected and recorded for each subject from the date the informed consent form was signed until the end of their participation in the study (i.e., the subject has discontinued or completed the study) through the follow -up visit with the exception of those who 
discontinue study medication during the study and are followed on a semi -annual basis.  Subjects 
who discontinue study medication but continue follow -up within the study will not have AEs collected 
after study drug discontinuation.  Only those AEs that occurred while on study drug that have not been resolved will be followed until resolution or stabilization.  
Adverse events may be volunteered spontaneously by [CONTACT_1177], or discovered by [CONTACT_262222], or  by [CONTACT_23501], non- leading question such as, “How have 
you been feeling since you were last asked?”  All AEs and any required remedial action will be recorded in the subject’s source documentation and transcribed onto the appropriate CRF page for the study period indicated.  The nature of AE, date (and time, if known) of AE onset, date (and time, if 
known) of AE outcome to date, severity, and action taken of the AE will be documented together with the CSSPIs or an authorized physician’s assessment of the seriousness of the AE and causal relationship to study medication and/or study procedure (at the time of assessment).  
All AEs should be recorded individually in the study subject’s own words (verbatim) unless, in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_261972], the AEs constitute components of a recognized 
condition, disease, or syndrome.  In the latter case, the condition, disease, or syndrome should be named rather than each individual symptom.  The AEs will subsequently be coded using the MedDRA.  
Appropriate measures should be taken to treat AEs as necessary, and the response of the study 
subject should be monitored and recorded.  Clinical, laboratory, and diagnostic measures should be obtained as needed, and the results of which should be recorded in the subject’s source 
documentation and transcribed onto the appropriate CRF page.  
The CSSPI [INVESTIGATOR_262075] [ADDRESS_318888]’s participation in the study, the CSSPI [INVESTIGATOR_262076] “spontaneously” if considered at least possibly related to study medication.  Upon entry of a serious adverse event by a CSSPI, the DCC Online Adverse Event

 Reporting System will immediately notify the Medical Safety Monitor (MSM).  
10.2. Severity Assessment  
The severity of AEs will be determined as described below:  
• Mild (Grade 1) : Ordinarily transient symptoms that do not influence performance of 
subject’s daily activities.  Treatment is not ordinarily indicated.  
• Moderate (Grade 2): Marked symptoms sufficient to make the subject uncomfortable.   
Moderate influence on performance of subject’s daily activities.  Treatment may be 
necessary.  
• Severe (Grade 3) : Symptoms cause considerable discomfort.  Substantial influence on 
subject’s daily activities.  May be unable to continue in the study and treatment may be necessary.  
• Life-Threatening (Grade 4) : Extreme limitation in activity, significant assistance required; 
significant and urgent medical/therapy intervention required. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_114956].  
• Death (Grade 5) : Death related to AE.  
When changes in the intensity of an AE occur more frequently than once a day, the maximum intensity for the event should be noted for that day.  Any change in grade of severity of signs and symptoms over a number of days will be captured by [CONTACT_44745] a new AE, with the amended severity grade and the date (and time, if known) of  the change.  
10.3. Medical Safety Monitor  
As previously indicated, [CONTACT_262239] will serve as the MSM for this trial.  In addition to performi
ng real -time reviews of all SAEs (as described in  section
 2.2), [CONTACT_262240] will also receive 
quarterl
y tabulations, by [CONTACT_47123], of all AEs/SAEs for the purpose of determining if 
any safety trends exist that may raise concerns.  Safety will be assessed in two ways – both the 
percentage of subjects who experience any AE and the rate of AEs will be compared by [CONTACT_262223].  The additional questions related to whether the AE/SAE is related to treatment and/or whether the AE/SAE is unanticipated will be used to subset these into a series of additional tables.  This quarterly review will identify any disconcerting discrepancy in the frequency of any AE/SAE between the two groups.  
11. INTERIM
 ANALYSES  
11.1. Interim Safety Monitoring  
After [ADDRESS_318889] 60 days, the Medical Safety Monitor will review pooled (i.e., blinded to treatment) safety data provided by [CONTACT_15791].  Beginning after approximately month 3 of enrollment start, a National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will meet every six months during the study (and more often, if deemed necessary), and will review blinded safety data including adverse events and serious adverse events (SAE).  The DSMB will be empowered to recommend stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_262077].  
11.2. Interim Efficacy and Futility Assessment  
One interim efficacy assessment will occur when 125, or approximately half , of the [ADDRESS_318890] completed their week 96 follow -up visit.  For these analyses, the Lan- DeMets alpha

 spending function approach with the O’Brien- Fleming  stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_262078].  Table 11.1 
below shows the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_262079] (one 
interim and one final analysis).

A formal futility assessment , based on the determination of predictive power, will also be conducted  at 
the time of the interim analysis.  If the predictive power is below 20% at the time of the interim 
analysis, then we would recommend that the study be stopped early for futility.

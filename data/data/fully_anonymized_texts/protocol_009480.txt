I. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
 
A. Treatment  for patients who suffer an ischemic stroke  typi[INVESTIGATOR_814443] s upon  a fixed and 
arbitrary time window . Therapy typi[INVESTIGATOR_84688] s intra-venous treatment (IVT) for 
patients  who present within 4.5 hours  of beginning of symptoms  and intra-arterial 
treatment (IAT ) for patients who arrive  within [ADDRESS_1127472] of care  [1]. During IVT, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)  is injected  into a  
vein in the arm. IAT is an endovascular procedure in which a catheter is inserted into an 
artery and directed to  the site of the blocked blood vessel in the brain .  The clot is 
removed  using a mechanical device  with or without  an injection of tPA  directly at the  site 
of the  clot.  Several types of mechanical devices are approved for clinical use.  Not all 
patients who arrive within this fixed  time window receive IVT or IAT, since certain 
defined subgroups of patients do not improve despi[INVESTIGATOR_814444] (i.e. 
opening of the occluded blood vessel) within the accepted time window.  
 
Patients who should not be treated include those  who demonstrate large areas of 
hypodensity  (i.e. dark tissue)  on head  computerized tomography  (CT) scan, those  with an 
intracranial hemorrhage, and those with other stroke mimics such as herpetic 
encephalitis . [2,3] To further improve  the criteria for  determining  which patients should 
receive therapy , a group of investigators developed  the ASPECT S core,  an imaging scale 
based on head CT . Patients with  an ASPECT S core of  < 6 will generally  not improve 
with treatment.  
 
B. To further improve patient selection (decrease the number of patients in whom successful 
revascularization is clinically futile) other noninvasive testing methods have been 
applied, including CT perfusion, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) perfusion, and 
diffusion based images. [4-8] Despi[INVESTIGATOR_814445], the good 
clinical outcome ( GCO ) rate consistently lags behind the rate of good revascularization, 
by [CONTACT_2669] 30 -40%.  
 
C. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_814446] (time from on set of symptoms and findings 
on CT scan), the percentage of GCO has been consistently lacking behind the  
recanalization rate s which has been steadily improving to up to 80 -90%. It is clear that a 
significant proportion of good revascularization s are futile  due to lack of clinical 
improvement [5-8, 9-12]  
 
  CIS Trial  
Version: 6.0 
Date: 03/30/2018  2 The investigators believe that focusing only on time and static noninvasive imaging for 
selecting patients suitable for IAT ignores critical physiological factors, i.e. 
differentiating blood -deprived yet v iable brain tissue fr om nonviable tissue.  The 
principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_218147] a system referred to as the Capi[INVESTIGATOR_814447] 
(CIS) that helps differentiat e between viable and nonviable tissue . The CIS is  obtained 
during the diagnostic cerebral angiogram (DCA) performed as a necessary step  at the 
time of treatment . The fact that the CIS is obtained just before proceeding with treatment 
differentiates it from all other currently employed neuroimaging -based patient selection 
strategies , which are s ometime done an hour or more prior to proceeding with the 
treatment.  Tissue  in the ischemic area  (tissue blocked from its usual primary blood 
supply) , but fed through secondary vessels ( pi[INVESTIGATOR_479359] ) represent s tissue  that can 
recover if the clot can be removed.  This secondary blood supply is shown by a blush 
surrounding the capi[INVESTIGATOR_814448].  The investigators believe that collateral  blood 
flow graded by [CONTACT_814464].  The CIS is a 4 point simple system 
(0-3).  The ischemic territory is divided into 3 sections. If a section exhibit s a capi[INVESTIGATOR_814449]. If the three section s of the ischemic territory ha ve a capi[INVESTIGATOR_814450] 3 . If none exhibit capi[INVESTIGATOR_814451]. Based on the 
1/3 hypodensity  rule we considered the CIS to be poor (pCIS) if more than 1/3 of the 
ischemic territory has no capi[INVESTIGATOR_814452] (CIS=0,  1). A score of 2 or 3 is  considered a 
favorable CIS (fCIS). DCA ( injecting the ischemic territory only) is a necessary step 
performed prior to clot removal .  Certain operators inject only the occluded vessel instead 
of obtaining more complete  imaging which assesses the anatomical and physiological 
status of collateral vessels . It is currently the usual practice of many  
neurointerve ntionalists  to obtain a complete set of DCA films prior to treatment which 
assess collateral circulation. This may increase the time of the intervention by 2-[ADDRESS_1127473] retrospectively examined the CIS for patients previously treated 
with IAT for this type of stroke [ 13-15], initially  via large case series analyses and 
subsequently by [CONTACT_814465] - controlled clinical trials . [9-11] The previous studies indicated that 
patients graded as having a fCIS, indicatin g good peripheral blood flow, typi[INVESTIGATOR_814453].  A good outcome is 
defined as a slight disability and able to carry out daily activities or better.  Good 
outcome rates have been on the order of 70-90% for patients with a favorable CIS and 
good revascularization.  This proportion of good outcomes far exceeds any published rate 
of good outcomes using all other peer - review published patient selection methodologies 
to date. For patients with a pCIS, t he maximum rate of good outcomes has been 13% 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_814454], which is actually well below the success rate 
of approximately 20% for patients who are left untreated, without even tPA [ 7].  These 
results raise the question if we a re not only not helpi[INVESTIGATOR_814455] . Clinical trials focused on IAT have had mixed results, with some 
trials showing no benefits compared to IVT with tPA alone [ 5, 8], and more recent trials 
showing superiority of the IAT plus IVT over IVT  alone  [3,13-14,16 ].  The absolute rates 
  CIS Trial  
Version: 6.0 
Date: 03/30/[ADDRESS_1127474] varied widely (52 -71%).  
The investigators believe that a primary factor explaining differences between studies is 
the portion  of people with favorable CIS included in the studies.  Interestingly the ratio 
between the rate of good outcomes in the treatment arm vs. the control arm  (no IAT)  has 
been stable across the different positive trials showing the effect of IAT at approximatel y 
1.[ADDRESS_1127475] II trial more than 15 years ago . 
[3].  The investigators believe  the stagnation of this ratio at 1.[ADDRESS_1127476] for patients 
with fCIS and obtain good revascularization to obtain around 80% GCO in the treated 
arm.  We al so expect successful revascularization to be futile  for patients with pCIS . 
 
E. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_814456]. 
In order to explore the genetic link to the CIS, this trial also aims to perform SNP -trait 
association analysis to identify the genetic loci linked to CIS and stroke outcome in 
patients suffering from AIS. Dce1  has recently been found to be responsible for 
approximately 85% of the variation in collateral extent and it is likely that 
polymor phisms of Dce1 are a major determinant of the wide variation in collateral scores 
in humans. If it is shown that Dce1  is correlated to CIS and both are predictive outcomes 
for EVT, then this will further increase confidence in CIS as an assessment of colla teral 
status, strengthen patient stratification of patients to define course of treatment for best 
outcome and least risk, and suggest the use of genetic testing in clinical decision making.  
 
II. STUDY OBJECTIVE (S); INCLUDING SPECIFIC AIMS AND/OR 
HYPOTHESES  
 
The hypothesis, or idea being tested, is that as long as patients have a favorable CIS they 
can be successfully treated with IAT out to 24 hours . For p atients with poor CIS, success 
rates will be relatively low, with no benefit provided by [CONTACT_430419].  The long term objective is 
to: 
a. Lengthen the time window of treatment for patients with fCIS from [ADDRESS_1127477] the health care system the costs of futile treatment of patients with pCIS.   
III. METHODS  
 
A. Study Design:  
  CIS Trial  
Version: 6.0 
Date: 03/30/2018  4 The current study focuses on patients with acute ischemic stroke due to a blockage of the 
intracranial internal carotid artery or middle cerebral artery  (M1) .  The study will be 
performed prospectively in up to 6 stroke centers.  Akron General Medical Center is the 
primary institution for development of the study and data analysis for this multicenter trial . 
To participate in the study, all centers need to meet certain qualified requirements which 
include:  
• One neurointerventionalist with 6 years’ experience in performing IAT with 
multiple devices.  
• Demonstrate coverage of the comprehensive stroke center 2 4 hours a day.    
The proposed study will be carried out over a period of 4 years  from the initial approval 
date.  Informed consent will be obtained for each patient, as described in section VIII.  
The study will be carried out in 2 phases  (Figure 1) .   
Phas e I will compare outcomes between treated patients with fCIS and pCIS.  All eligible 
patients will be assessed by  a full diagnostic cerebral angiogram with dye injection of all 
potential collaterals.  DCA  will be used to characterize the CIS.  Treatment wi ll be identical 
for both groups.  All patients will be treated with the combination of IAT and the normal 
standard of care for a patient not receiving IAT  (which may include IVT, but not always ). 
The sample size will be set to have 60 patients complete the  trial.  Distribution of fCIS and 
pCIS patients will not be forced, but the option to balance groups may be employed if the 
percentage for one group reaches 70%.  
In phase II, after confirming the hypothesis that patients with pCIS tend to have poor 
outcome s as compared to the natural history of the disease , only patients with pCIS will be 
enrolled.  [ADDRESS_1127478] of care  based on a simple 1:[ADDRESS_1127479] of care .  Based on previous studies, the results from Phase I should show 
poor results for pCIS patients, on the order of 15% good outc omes, below the published good 
outcomes for patients receiving no treatment.  This phase will provide preliminary data to 
determine if IAT provides any benefit in these patients, or is even potentially harmful , which 
no other clinical trial to date of IAT has formally hypothesized or tested as plausible .  Due to 
the low rate of success the investigators realize this phase will be underpowered to 
definitively show differences between two groups, but the phase will provide preliminary 
safety pi[INVESTIGATOR_207636] a t opic not studied to date to develop plans for a larger and adequately 
powered study.  
 All eligible patients participating in both phase I and phase II will be given the option to 
donate an additional 8.5 ml blood sample for genetic testing of the Dce1  gene . Blood samples 
will be collected in Paxgene DNA tubes. Collection of this sample will occur during 
regularly scheduled blood work within 48 -60 hours of admission. Akron General will store 
all samples until all patients are enrolled  after which the samples  will be sent to a 
biospecimen processing facility to identify polymorphisms of the Dce1  gene.  Results 
obtained from the genetic testing will be analyzed in conjunction with data from phase I and 
II. 
The primary measure of outcome will be the same for both  phases.  The outcomes will be 
measured based on the modified Rankin Scale (see appendix) at least 3 months  and again at 1 
year following treatment.  Patients will be graded according to this scale by [CONTACT_814466]: 6.0 
Date: 03/30/[ADDRESS_1127480] or other mRS scale certified health care provider not involved in the treatment 
and blinded to the treatment for each patient.   
 
B. Study Population :  
The population for the study will be patients with anterior circulation acute ischemic 
stroke due to blockage of the intracranial internal carotid artery or middle cerebral artery 
(M1) within [ADDRESS_1127481] angiography, magnetic 
resonance angiography, or DCA.  Only patients 18 or over will be considered for the study.  
Other inclusion criteria include a score of 8 or greater on the National Institute of H ealth 
Stroke Scale (NIHSS, see appendix). Exclusion criteria will include contra -indication for 
IAT found on initial CT, intracranial hemorrhage, stroke mimics (tumor, herpetic 
encephalitis, etc.), more than 1/[ADDRESS_1127482] Score  < 6, and p re-existing disability defined as mRS ≥  2.  Pregnant 
women will also be excluded.

C. Assessment of Resources   
The multicenter study will be carried out at up to [ADDRESS_1127483] . For all eligible patients, an 8.5 ml 
blood sample will be collected followe d by [CONTACT_814467]. Sample specimens 
will be stored at a temperature of 2ºC to 8ºC at each institution for a maximum of 28 days 

  CIS Trial  
Version: 6.0 
Date: 03/30/2018  7 before being shipped to Akron General. Akron General will store all samples for long -term at 
temperatures between -70ºC and -80ºC until the samples are sent for genetic analysis.  
The initial phase of treatment for patients treated with IAT typi[INVESTIGATOR_20187] 2-3 hours in 
the angio suite to try to remove the clot from the blood vessel .  To remove the clot, Trevo 
stent retriever (Stryker Neurovascular) will be used as the first pass. Patients are then 
transferred to the neuroscience intensive care unit (routine). The length of stay in the unit  
varies from patient to patient and will be determined  by [CONTACT_814468].  Patients can 
be discharged to home care or to a rehabilitation facility depending on their condition, based 
on the current standard of care.  All medications and rehabilitation techniques prescribed for 
patients following the procedure will be based on the normal standard of care for the treating 
physician, regardless  of the treatment group or classification of the CIS.  
For follow -up, patient s will be seen by [CONTACT_814469][INVESTIGATOR_814457].  The primary outcome measure will be acquired at the 90 day follow up.  
At this appointment, a mRS score will be ascribed for the patient by a modified Rankin Scale 
certified health care provider blinded to the  CIS categorization (phase I) or the treatment 
(phase II).  Assessment based on the mRS is standard for follow up appointments, regardless 
of inclusion in the study.  A standard follow up visit typi[INVESTIGATOR_20187]  15-[ADDRESS_1127484] of care.  The primary outcome measure will be acquired at the 1 year  
follow up.  At this appointment, a mRS  score will be ascribed for the patient by a modified 
Rankin Scale certified health care provider blinded to the CIS categorization (phase I) or the 
treatment (phase II).  Assessment based on the mRS is standard for follow up appointments, 
regardless of in clusion in the study.  A standard follow up visit typi[INVESTIGATOR_20187] [ADDRESS_1127485] 90 days 
following treatment  and again at 1 year following treatment .  NIHSS score will be obtained 
in the emergency room before the treatment, within 24 h of treatment, and before discharge. 
The person who will obtain the NIHSS will be certified to obtain it.  Adequacy of 
revascularization will be assessed at the end of treatment by [CONTACT_814470] (mTICI) scale  (see Appendix) .  All of the se 
measures are standards for care and trials of acute ischemic stroke . [8-10] All case report 
forms  will be maintained by [CONTACT_814471], and stored within 
locked cabinets.  The personal identifying information on the case repo rt forms  will be de -
identified and assigned a code before being transferred to Akron General Medical Center for 
transfer of the data to a de -identified database which will be used for analysis.  
 
IV. DATA COLLECTION  
 
  CIS Trial  
Version: 6.0 
Date: 03/30/2018  8 A. How and what data will be collected   
Data re lated to patient demographics, stroke risk factors, condition prior to treatment, 
time of treatment , and outcomes  will be collected for each patient.  Data on demographics 
will include sex, age, and race.  Data on stroke risk factors will include history o f 
hypertension, blood pressure , prior heart attack, arrhythmias, diabetes , glucose  (sugar) level 
at admission , and obesity.   Data on condition prior to treatment will include NIHSS score 
determined in the emergency room.  Data on time of treatment will include time from 
symptoms to arrival at emergency room, time to start of DCA, and time to end of the 
procedure.  Data on outcomes will include mRS at 3 months , mRS at 1 year , NIHSS score 
within 24 hours and at discharge, and  complications brain edema and intra -cranial 
hemorrhage . Other parameters within these categories could be acquired as deemed 
necessary for analysis of the data.  
 
V. DATA ANALYSIS  
 
A. Sample Size Considerations  
Phase I 
A power analysis has been performed based o n the previous retrospective analyses of the 
relationship between outcomes and the CIS  for phase I .  The sample size was calculated for 
the influence of the combination of CIS and revascularization on good outcomes (mRS ≤ 2) 
based on the following assumpti ons.  
 The percentage of patients with fCIS will be 60%  
 The percentage of patients with good revascularization will be 50%  
 The rate of good outcomes for the combination of fCIS and good revascularization 
is assumed to be 70%  
 The rate of good outcomes for the combination of fCIS and poor revascularization 
is assumed to be 20%  
 The rate of good outcomes for the combination of pCIS and good revascularization 
is assumed to be 20%  
 The rate of good outcomes for the combination of pCIS and poor r evascularization 
is assumed to be 10%  
The assumptions provide the following power analysis:  
 𝛼 = 0.05  for overall analysis and set to 0.025 for subgroup analysis comparing fCIS 
and good revascularization to all other groups due to multiple comparisons  
 powe r = 0.90  
 Needed Sample size = 54 patients  
 An additional [ADDRESS_1127486] to the 90 day follow up and/or deviations from the protocol.   
Phase II 
Phase II will be an exploratory study evaluating the rates for good outcomes for patients 
with pCIS treated with IVT plus IAT vs. IVT (or other standard of care) only.  The rate of 
good outcomes is expected to be app roximately 13% for the IAT group  with 
revascularization .  The investigators have no prior data on expected rates of good outcomes 
for patients with pCIS treated with IVT only.  The best possible outcome rate would be on 
  CIS Trial  
Version: 6.0 
Date: 03/30/2018  9 the order of 25% noted previously fo r untreated acute ischemic stroke.  Due to the low levels 
of good outcomes, the investigators acknowledge the study will be underpowered to detect a 
difference between the two treatment groups for a total sample size of 30.  Phase II will serve 
as a pi[INVESTIGATOR_814458] a larger prospective study.  
Genetic Analysis  
Genetic analysis will be performed based on the following:  
 Genetic and expression analysis f or the two groups based on their collateral score  
 Adjust groups for cardiovascular/stroke risk factor presence and other known 
confounding conditions  
 High density SNP array analysis will be performed for common and rare alleles 
against known collateral -related genes that have been identified in mice. These 
include human RABEP2 and its isoform RABEP1 and related gene pathways; 
VEGFA, FLK1 and their related gene pathways; NOTCH, DLL4, ADAM10, 
ADAM17, CNX37 and their related gene pathways.  
 Subgroup analysis wi ll be performed for ethnicities.  
 Taqman assays and/or exome sequencing of significantly associated SNPs and/or 
genes.  
 Pending results, a future validation study will follow this discovery study by 
[CONTACT_814472].   
B. Statistical Methodology  
 
Data for the proposed study will be analyzed using comparison of proportions and 
multivariable logistic regression.  Analysis of proportions based on Fisher exact  tests will be 
used to compare rates of good outcomes between the fCIS and pCIS groups as the primary 
end point for phase I.  The influence of successful revascularization on outcomes for patients 
with fCIS or pCIS will also be analyzed using  Fisher exact  tests as the secondary end point.  
Binary and/or ordinal multiple l ogistic regression analyses will be used to evaluate the 
influence of multiple parameters on the likelihood of a good outcome.  These parameters will 
include CIS, mTICI score, NIHSS score, time to revascularization, age, sex, history of 
diabetes mellitus, history of high blood pressu re, history of coronary artery disease.  The 
same analyses will be performed for phase II, instead focusing on the treatment groups rather 
than the CIS classification . 
 
VI. DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING PLAN  
 
A. Describe any provisions for monitoring the data for sa fety 
 
A safety committee will monitor the data.  The safety committee will be composed of at 
least [ADDRESS_1127487] 
one member with a background in biostatistics who is not  an investigator or affiliated with 
Akron General Medical Center will also be on the committee.   
For phase I, the only deviations in normal standards of care  are: 
  CIS Trial  
Version: 6.0 
Date: 03/30/2018  10 1- the extra few minutes for full DCA for some centers as opposed to injecting only the 
occluded vessel  
2- Adding IAT to treatment of patients seen between 6 and 24 hours of onset of 
symptoms .  
The safety committee will be looking at known potential complications for IAT in both fCIS 
and pCIS groups.  These include :  
A. parenchymal hemorrhage type 2 symptomatic or asymptomatic hemorrhagic 
transformation within the vascular territory of the index ischemic stroke within 24 hours 
of treatment  
B. Any neurological worsening (NIHSS increase of 4 points or  more) within [ADDRESS_1127488] of care , giving the indication that IAT should not be withheld from patients during 
phase II.  During phase II, the safety committee will review the data on complications as 
noted above and percentage of good outcomes after 10 and 20 subjects are evaluated for 
comparisons between the two treatment groups.  
 
VII. STUDY LIMITATIONS  
 
A. Potential Limitations of Procedures   
 
The primary limitation for phase II  is the small sample size .  Due to the expected 
relatively low rates of good outcomes for pCIS patients regardless of type of treatment, the 
power will not be sufficient to establish whether or not treatment with IAT is beneficial for 
patients  with pCIS .  The study will , howev er, provide the preliminary data needed to plan for 
a future, larger prospective clinical trial.  Potential limitations for the genetic component of 
this study include DNA damage due to improper handling or storage of blood samples. The 
Paxgene DNA tubes are de signed to stabilize DNA in the blood. However, the tubes will 
only function properly if the instructions for inverting the tube multiple times and prompt 
shipment for storage at Akron General are followed.  
 
VIII.  ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
A. Informed Consent  
Enrollm ent of patients will be performed in an imaging suite at each institution.  Once 
eligibility is determined by [CONTACT_814473], the consent process will 
be initiated by a  study research coordinator  or study nurse .  These investigator s are familiar 
with all aspects of the proposed treatment methods and typi[INVESTIGATOR_814459].   
Consent will be obtained using IRB -approved consent forms.  The consent process will 
emphasize oral presentation with brief summaries of the relevant information due to the time 
  CIS Trial  
Version: 6.0 
Date: 03/30/2018  11 sensitive nature of treatment of stroke.  The consent process will include visual illustrations 
and simple consent forms.  The presentatio n will include an explanation of the 
diagnosis/proposed treatment with a  focus on risks, benefits and alternative treatments.  Best 
available rates on outcomes for the proposed treatment methods will be provided.   
 Due to the influence of stroke on mental  function, a capacity assessment will be 
performed for each eligible subject.  The capacity assessment will include the following 
elements:  
 Indication that the  patient is being asked to make a treatment choice and the patient’s 
ability to assess current he alth situation and make the choice is being evaluated  
 Inquiries into the patient ’s self -assessed ability to make a treatment choice  and 
assessment of the patient’s ability to paraphrase disclosed information  
 Ability of the patients to express a stable choice, with treatment decision expressed 
immediately after disclosure and at the close of the interview  
 Careful document ation of  the encounter  
Alternative measures of consent will be employed for patients who d o not demonstrate 
acceptable mental capacity.  The alternative process will include:  
 Attempting  to establish whether patient has drafted an advance directive (i.e. living 
will, power of attorney)  
 In the absence of an advance directive, seeking substituted judgment of a proxy 
authorized by [CONTACT_814474] (i.e. power of attorney, family member) is not immediately present , telephone consent 
will be used. A study resea rch coordinator or study nurse will fully explain the diagnosis and 
proposed treatment, with a focus on risks, benefits and alternative treatments in the same 
manner as the normal consent process. The telephone consent process will include the 
following st eps: 
 Two witnesses will listen to the statements made by [CONTACT_814475].  
 One of those witnesses will indicate, "Phone consent by," print the consenting 
individual's name [CONTACT_292557] [CONTACT_814476].  
 Both persons will date and sign the consent form as witnesses.  
 The proxy will provide written consent , using the normal trial consent forms, upon 
arrival at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] . 
 
B. Risks and Side Effects   
Acute anterior circulation large vessel occlusion ischemic stroke is a serious  and 
potentially fatal condition. Severe disability and death can result regardless of the type of 
treatment performed.  For the proposed study, risk is minimized by [CONTACT_814477] I with the combination of IAT and standard of care .  Random ization of treatment 
between IAT plus standard of care or standard of care  alone is only used for the patients 
with pCIS in phase II, after establishing a poor rate of good outcomes (< 15%) for those 
patients with pCIS treated with the combination of IAT and IVT.  Patients not enrolled in 
the study will be treated with the normal standard of care for the participating institution.  
At Akron General Medical Center the normal standard of care is supportive treatment .  
The investigators believe there is a ris k to treating patients with pCIS with IAT.  Opening 
  CIS Trial  
Version: 6.0 
Date: 03/30/2018  12 up the blood supply to ischemic tissue could potentially increase the risk of vasogenic 
edema and/or hemorrhagic transformation, as well as possible herniation.  
It is theoretically possible that results f rom the genetic analysis could be used to 
obtain information that could lead to patient discrimination by [CONTACT_814478]. However, given the de -identification at the contributing institution 
followed by [CONTACT_78150] -site genetic analysis  on the de -identified samples, coupled with the 
genetic data for any individual not being returned to the contributing site, the risk is felt 
to be negligible.  
No compensation to patients for poor outcomes is available for participating in this 
study.  Akron General Medical Center will continue to provide standard care to all 
enrolled subjects following the initial stroke care, and submit charges for all usual ca re to 
the patient’s insurance.  The patient will be responsible for any charges not covered by 
[CONTACT_22241].  In case of emergency following treatment, patients should follow standard 
practices to seek urgent medical treatment.  Adverse events should also be reported to the 
principal investigator ([CONTACT_127943] -Ali) at [PHONE_16972] . 
 
C. Adverse  events  
Adverse events may include:  
1. New clot formation due to placement of guiding catheter  
2. Intra -cranial  hemorrhage due to perforation of the treated vessel  
3. Symptomatic intra -parenchymal  hemorrhage  
4. Extension of clot to a previously patent vessel  
5. Interval developi[INVESTIGATOR_814460]/or other sign of mass effect  
6. Arterial access complications such as retroperitoneal  hematoma , rectus 
muscle hematom a, or large groin hematoma  more than [ADDRESS_1127489] of care .  
Currently those patients are not offered  IAT due to the belief that too much time has 
passed to restore tissue that has been deprived of the primary source of circulation.  
However, the new Extend IA trial proved that these patients could be treated. [4] The 
investigators believe that successful treatment beyond [ADDRESS_1127490]

F.  Provisions for vulnerable subjects   
Vulnerable subjects, children, pregnant women, and prisoners, will not be enroll ed in 
the study.  
 
G. Subject Privacy and Data Confidentiality  
Measures will be taken to protect the privacy of the subjects and confidentiality of 
their personal information from the enrolled subjects.  The enrollment process will take 
place within the imagi ng suite  or emergency department , in a manner to maximize the 
probability that only the caregivers will be aware that a subject is eligible for a trial.  The 
only other person at each site who will be aware that a subject is enrolled will be a 
research coo rdinator at each site tasked with collecting data and reviewing procedures.   
The protected health information will be collected for each enrolled subject at each 
site.  The paper files will be stored within locked filing cabinets within the office of the 
primary investigator or research coordinator.  The data will be de -identified before being 
provided to the primary institution for analysis  (honest broker) .  Patients will be 
identified based on a code including an identifier for the site and the patient number at the 
site.  Any electronic files relating the patient name [CONTACT_814480].  The files will be password protected and stored on a single desktop computer.  
The files may be backed up on a password -protected portabl e drive.  When data is used 
for presentations at professional organizations or submissions to journals, no patient 
identifiers will be disclosed.  All data will be maintained at each site for a minimum of 3 
years.  After the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_814461], the paper data from individual patients will be shredded, while 
electronic data will be deleted and overwritten.  
 
IX.  PLANS FOR DISSEMINATION OF FINDINGS  
Data acquired for the study will be prepa red for publication in journals focused on treatment 
of acute ischemic stroke.  The study will also be registered on clinicaltrials.gov to allow the 
general public to access the results of the study.

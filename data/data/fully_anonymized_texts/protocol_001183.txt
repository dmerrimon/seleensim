9 1. Introduction - Background and Rationale  
1.1 Mantle Cell Lymphoma – Disease Overview  
Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a subtype of Non- Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) which is 
considered incurable with conventional therapy. With an incidence of approximately 70,000 
cases diagnosed in the [LOCATION_002]  (US) per year, the disease is rare. It typi[INVESTIGATOR_747265] 60 and 2/3rd of the cases are male.[ADDRESS_1022398] 
is considered the typi[INVESTIGATOR_747266], occurring in 60- 75% of cases. This form typi[INVESTIGATOR_747267]. 
The second is an indolent form typi[INVESTIGATOR_747268] ( WBC ) 
count and circulating lymphoma cells as well as  splenomegaly. This indolent form is 
characterized by [CONTACT_747297]- slow course and observation alone is recommended i f 
asymptomatic.2 The final form is a blastic variety which is typi[INVESTIGATOR_747269], often 
presenting with marked lymphadenopathy and B -symptoms including fevers, chill s, sweats, 
and/or weight loss.  Other than observation in the indolent variety, there is no treatment 
differences between the variants of MCL.  
1.[ADDRESS_1022399] been studied with bendamustine and rituximab (BR) currently considered a standard induction regimen for patients unwilling or ineligible for aggressive therapy.  
BR was first studied by [CONTACT_747298] (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristi ne and prednisone) vs. BR in  indolent NHL. The 
MCL cohort included 94 patients and BR had an improved median progression- free survival 
(PFS) over RCHOP (35.[ADDRESS_1022400] Ratio ( HR) 0.49, p=0.0044).
3 Superiority 
of BR over RCHOP was also confirmed in the US through the BRIGHT study.4 Another 
study through the German cooperative group compared FR (fludarabine and rituximab) to 
BR in  indolent NHL. The MCL cohort in this study was 47 patients and again showed 
improved median PFS to BR over FR (17.6 vs. 4.7 months, p=0.01).[ADDRESS_1022401] of care for MCL patients unable to be treated with aggressive measures.  
Bendamustine and rituximab is generally well tolerated in this patient population. The only 
elderly MCL study assessing BR showed a Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  rate of 2/63 during 
induction; however, there were deaths during the maintenance phase of this study (3 of 
62).6 Other studies, which include other NHL histologies, show a similar rate of SAE or 
Grade 3/4 non- hematologic toxicities  that occasionally  prompt s withdrawal prior to 
completion of recommended 6 cycles.3,4,5 Deaths during induction are rare.  However, in a 
retrospectiv e study of CLL patients, dose reductions to 70 mg/m2 occurred in half of patients 
over the age of 65, mostly due to neutropenia and infections.7 Of those over the age of 75, 
69% of patients required dose reduction to 70 mg/m2. 7 This has prompted some providers 
to start all patients of very advanced age (over 80) and others with comorbid conditions at 
70 mg/m2 instead of 90 mg/m2 day [ADDRESS_1022402] form.

Date: 10/ 11/[ADDRESS_1022403] promising BR based regimens. However, 
there are other promising therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], including venetoclax  that will likely be important in MCL 
within this two year time frame.  This study evaluates venetoclax in combination w ith 
bendamus tine and rituximab. If there is promise in this study, this combination will be 
considered in a larger Phase III study for induction therapy in MCL planned through the US 
cooperative groups.  
Safety in the reported combination studies with BR indicate increased toxicity with additional 
drugs. The LENA -BERIT (BR+ Lenalidomide) study mentioned previously had a Grade 3- 5 
infection rate of 42% (21 of 51) with a death rate during induction of 3 of 51. This was 
considered overly toxic, though the efficacy was high in this study.13 The addition of 
bortezomib and dexamethasone to BR (RiBVD) in 76 older MCL patients showed 4 deaths 
during induction; 1 infection, 1 progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) and 2 
cardiac arrests.14 The rate of febrile neutropenia on this study was 11% (11 of 74) and 24 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_747270].14 Therefore, there is a suggestion that studies 
combining novel agents with BR show more toxicity than BR alone and should be evaluated closely for toxicity including deaths and infection.  It is known that bendamustine can cause 
delayed lymphocyte recovery and thus atypi[INVESTIGATOR_95908], such as Pneumocystis Jiroveci  
Pneumonia (PJP), Cytomegalovirus  (CMV) and Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) are possible 
and have been reported and s een by [CONTACT_431].
15,16,17 
1.4 Venetoclax (ABT -199, GDC -0199)  
Venetoclax is a novel, oral, highly selective BCL2 inhibitor which is currently Food and Drug Administration ( FDA) approved in relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) .
18 Inhibition 
of BCL 2, an anti -apoptotic protein that is overexpressed in many NHL’s , allows for apoptosis 
to proceed and induces rapi d cell kill.19 Venetoclax has been studied in various NHL 
histologies as a single agent and in combination with chemotherapy and other targete d 
agents.  
1.4.1  Clinical Efficacy and Safety in MCL and NHL  
Response to single- agent venetoclax has been documented in 28 relapsed MCL 
patients  in a Phase I study evaluating all histologies of NHL. The MCL cohort had  
an overall response rate ( ORR) of 75% (n=21) with few complete responses (CR s) 
(n=6, 21%).20 Given the risk of TLS, the dose of venetoclax was increased from 20 
mg to the target dose over several weeks. The ending dose was 200 mg (n=1), 400 mg (n=9), 600 mg (n=4), 800 mg (n=7), 900 mg (n=1) and 1200 mg (n=6). There was no difference in efficacy between these doses and the target dose going 
forward for MCL is 400 mg orally ( PO) daily. Additional studies evaluating 
combinations of venetoclax with chemotherapy and other targeted agents are on -
going.  
Venetoclax is generally safe though the majority of patients will experience a 
treatment emergent adverse event. Common side effects in NHL are mostly hematologic including neutropenia (Grade 3 or 4: 14.8%), febrile neutropenia

Date: 10/ 11/202 1 
 
11 (Grade 3 or 4:  2.2%), thrombocytopenia (Grade 3 or 4: 9.6%), and anemia (Grade 
3 or 4:  14.8%). Gastrointestinal (GI) toxicities including nausea and diarrhea are 
also common but tend to be low grade (all grade 47%, Grade 3 or 4 <1%). 
Infections, mostly being upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_747271] s een with venetoclax. Please 
see the Investigator Brochure  (IB) and prescribing information for more detail.21,[ADDRESS_1022404] that a Phase II study of BR + venetoclax is warranted in MCL.  Dosing with chemot herapy 
has not been optimized. The follicular lymphoma study utilized continuous dosing of venetoclax with BR and demonstrated a Grade 3- 4 Adverse Event (AE)  rate of 
78% compared to 46% without venetoclax.
[ADDRESS_1022405] dose of drug.19 
The risk of TLS necessitates careful dose titration of the drug and sometimes admission for hydration and TLS monitoring.  Tumor lysis has also been seen in 
MCL, but to a lesser degree and usually in the setting of high tumor burden (verbal communication, unpublished data).  Thus, in MCL, careful upward dose titration is 
still n eeded. In this study, we will start with [ADDRESS_1022406] M onitoring in MCL  
The absence of Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) is a powerful predictor of outcome after 
induct ion in MCL.  MRD can be measured in many ways but the most sensitive is a 
polymerase- chain reaction ( PCR ) based test quantifying the presence of a clonal 
immunoglobulin heavy chain re- arrangement or t(11;14) .27,28 A combined analysis of 
transplant eligible and ineligible patients (MCL Younger and MCL Elderly studies) showed 
MRD positive patients consistently had an adverse PFS after all induction treatment (chemotherapy in MCL Elderly and chemotherapy followed by [CONTACT_747299] ( SCT) in MCL Younger) .

meaningful surrogate of PFS and overall survival ( OS) after induction therapy in MCL 
patients.

Date: 10/ 11/[ADDRESS_1022409]. Given toxicity seen in the follicular lymphoma study combining BR with continuous venetoclax, we will utilize venetoclax as a chemosensitizer and only treat for 10 days with each cycle. Mainten ance rituximab will be allowed per investigator discretion given the 
complexity of the issue in MCL after BR therapy.  
We plan to utilize a CR rate of 70% as a historical control based on early evaluation of  the 
induction therapy of E1411.
29 To be considered promising, we hope to improve this by 15% 
to 85%. CR is our primary outcome to allow for a quick readout and allow for potential inclusio n in a future randomized study.  We will also monitor MRD via PCR based methods 
throughout the study as an exploratory  objective. 
1.6.1  October  11, 2021: Revised Summary  of Rationale  
Preliminary data from a similar cohort of patients  as that  enrolled in this study 
indicates that post -induction CR rate is 60%, not 70% as initially assumed. In 
addition, the observed study accrual rate ( 1.1 patients/month) is significantly lower 
than the planned/expected study accrual rate of 2.3 patients/month. For both reasons, the study was redesigned to reflect the current historical CR rate and with a lowered sample size for prompt primary endpoint readout. Accrual before this 
redesign is 25 patients.  
A 17% increase in CR rate  from 60% (null)  to 77%  (alternate) is of interest .

rituximab/hyaluronic acid package insert.  Biosimilars for rituximab  are permitted. 
All doses are based on actual body weight.  
Prophylactic filgrastim, pegfilgrastim or pegfilgrastim on body injector  (OBI)  or biosimilars  
will be administered for all patients on study per Section 5.5. 
Pneumocystis Jiroveci  Pneumonia (PJP)  and antiviral prophylaxis will be initiated in all 
patients (Section 5.6) . 
Section 5.7 for Monitoring of Cytomegalovirus (CMV).  
Premedication: Acetaminophen and diphenhydramine should be administered prior to 
each infusion or injection of rituximab, per institution guidelines. Other prophylactic 
medications may be administered per institution guidelines.  
Antiemetic T herapy:  Standard anti -emetic therapy may be given to patients prior to 
administration of bendamustine  per institutional guidelines. However, 5- HT3 serotonin 
receptor agonist and steroids are strongly recommended.  
Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS)  is an event of interest and will be monitored closely during 
therapy.  TLS will be assessed by [CONTACT_86792] (DSMB) among the

5.5 Neutropenic Sepsis Prophylaxis  
Bendamustine and venetoclax can cause neutropenia. Prophylaxis for neutropenic sepsis 
and febrile neutropenia is required with one of the following (Growth Colony Stimulating 
Factors [GCSFs]) to be administered 24-[ADDRESS_1022444] dose of bendamustine for 
each cycle.

neutropenia  
5.[ADDRESS_1022445] be initiated on prop hylaxis for PJP  at the time of Cycle 2 of venetoclax, 
bendamustine and rituximab. However, PJP prophylaxis may be administered with Cycle 1 
if the treating physician feels the risk of PJP is higher than the risks during the venetoclax 
dose ramp up. Trimethoprim -sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim ) is the preferred treatment of 
choice for PJP prophylaxis. PJP prophylaxis should continue until  6-[ADDRESS_1022446] completed induction cycle. PJP prophylaxis may be discontinued at that time, or continued at the discretion of the treating physician . If the patient will not be able to take 
trimethoprim -sulfamethoxazole then alternatives include: Dapsone, Pentam idine (aerosol) 
or Atovaquone. (The myelosuppressive effects of trimethoprim -sulfamethoxazole when 
administ ered in prophylactic doses is minimal.)  
Patients must also be initiated on acyclovir or valcyclov ir as prophylaxis against Herpes 
Simplex and Varicella Zoster  viral infections.  Antiviral prophylaxis should continue for a 
minimum of 6 months after completion of induction, and may be discontinued at that time, or continued at the discretion of the treating physician. 
If lymphopenia is documented (absolute lymphocyte count <500), then the investigator may 
choose to continue prophylactic medications for a longer duration.  
NOTE:  The above mentioned prophylactic medications have no known interactions with the 
study drugs . 
5.7 Monitoring for  Cytomegalovirus  (CMV)  
Patients will be monitored for CMV reactivation using Quantitative PCR assay for CMV DNA.  
Induction Phase:  Quantitative PCR will be checked once a month and at the end of 
induction . 
Maintenance Phase:  Treating physician  discretion or per institutional standards ; however, 
if the CMV level at the end of induction is detectable, it is recommended to continu e 
monitoring CMV PCR per institutional standards .

● CMV DNA detected <137 IU/m L 
● CMV DNA detected between 137 and 9,100,00 0 IU/m L 
● CMV DNA detected >9,100,000 IU/m L 
If CMV PCR  is reported as >137 IU/mL, then the frequency of testing for the PCR needs to 
be changed to weekly monitoring.  
If CMV PCR is >500 IU/ml and the trend is rising, on subsequent weekly measurements 
then: 
● The study treatment will be held  
● Preemptive CMV therapy will be initiated as per institutional guidelines in conjunction 
with Infectious disease specialist s

CMV reactivation if all the following conditions are met:  
● CMV reactivation is resolved as determined by [CONTACT_093] 
● The CMV reactivation was NOT associated with any known end organ disease ( for 
example: pneumonitis, hepatitis, gastroenteritis, retinitis, encephalitis ) 
● Patient is deemed clinically appropriate to restart therap y 
Once treatment is restarted, secondary prophylaxis must be maintained per institutional 
guidelines.

25 6. Dose Delays & Modifications  
All toxicities should be graded according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 5.0 (CTCAE V5 .0). A copy of the CTCAE  
V5.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP website (http://www.ctep.cancer.gov ). 
A 3 day window is allowed for scheduled therapy, tests  and/or results  except as noted for TLS 
monitoring . Delays due to holidays, weekends, bad weather or other unforeseen circumstances will 
be permitted. 
If administration of venetoclax, bendamustine or rituximab  is delayed on day 1 of a cycle, the 
administration of all the agents should be delayed for the same timeframe. For example, if 
bendamustine is delayed, administration of venetoclax and rituximab should also be delayed so that they are given together beginning on Day 1 of the same cycle (Cycle 1 cannot be more than 49 
days) . 
NOTE : For CMV reactivatio n and infection management, please refer to Section 5.7  
If any of the study drugs are permanently discontinued (i.e., Grade 4 infusion- related reaction with 
rituximab), the patient will be removed from study  and followed per Section 7.2 . 
NOTE:  TLS will be considered as laboratory or clinical TLS per Appendix IV.

with bleeding  - Hold venetoclax until febrile neutropenia resolves, ANC recovers to >1000/mm3 
and/or platelets recover to >50,000/mm3. Resume venetoclax dosing. 
- There may be a prolongation of C ycle 1 by [CONTACT_8622] 28 days. In general, after 
resuming venetoclax , please allow for 7 (+/ - 1) days with each dose increase. 
Cycle 1 cannot be more than 49 days . 
At Start of Cycle 2 -6: 
• Grade [ADDRESS_1022448] 7 days and up to 2 8 days . 
- Once ANC resolves to > 1000/mm3 and/or platelets  resolve >75,000/mm3, resume

29 however, systemic (IV, IM, or PO) corticosteroids will not be allowed to control 
lymphoma related symptoms after Cycle [ADDRESS_1022458] study treatment:  
• Immunotherapy other than prescribed in the treatment plan. 
• Any FDA -approved or experimental therapy intended for the treatment of 
lymphoma including systemic corticosteroids, unless otherwise listed . 
• Warfarin (novel anticoagulants are allowed so long as there are no other drug-drug interactions) . 
• Strong to moderate inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A per Appendix III. 
o Weak inhibitors and inducers are allowed  
o Please contact [CONTACT_747308]  
• Strong to moderate P-gp inhibitors such as amiodarone, azithromycin, 
captopril, carvedilol, cyclosporine, felodipi[INVESTIGATOR_050], quercetin, quinidine, ranolazine, 
ticagrelor  (Appendix III) . 
• Grapefruit and grapefruit juice, Seville oranges (including marmalade/jam) and 
star fruit are known inhibitors of CYP3A and should be avoided. 
• In cycles 2 -6 when venetoclax will not be administered (i.e., Days 11- 28), a void 
the use of strong or moderate CYP 3A inhibitors  or P-gp inhibitors 2 to 3 days 
prior to the next cycle of venetoclax treatment . 
• In cycles 2 -6 when venetoclax  will not be administered (i.e., Days 11- 28), a void 
the use of strong or moderate CYP3A inducers at least 7 days prior to the next cycle of venetoclax treatment . 
NOTE:  Continuous use of strong and moderate CYP3A inhibitors , CYP3A inducers  
or P-gp inhibitors  is not allowed. If a patient  requires continuous use of 
these drugs they will need to be excluded.  
Concomitant medications that fall into the categories below could potentially lead to 
adverse reactions and should be considered cautionary (except where noted). If a 
potential study patient is taking any of the medications in the categories described 
below, the investigator must assess and document the use of medications known or suspected to fall in the following medication categories:  
o P- gp substrates such as digoxin, everolimus, and sirolimus  due to inhibition 
potential at therapeutic dose levels .

separate dosing of the P- gp substrate at least 6 hours before venetoclax.  
o CYP2C8 substrates such as thiazolidinediones (glitazones) and select statins 
(because of expected inhibition of the metabolism of CYP2C8 substrates) by 
[CONTACT_27840] . 
o CYP2C9 substrates such as tolbutamide (because of expected inhibition of the 
metabolism of CYP2C9 substrates by [CONTACT_27840]). It is recommended to exclude CYP2C9 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index such as  phenytoin.  
Additionally, caution should be exercised, or alternative treatments considered, 
when co- administering bendamustine with a CYP1A2 inhibitor  or CYP1A2 inducer .

31 7. Study Duration and Discontinuation of Therapy 
7.1 Study Duration 
Patients will receive protocol therapy until: 
1. Any of the study drugs are permanently discontinued (i.e., Grade 4 infusion- related 
reaction with rituximab), the patient will be removed from study.  
2. Subject completes 6 cycles of treatment per Section 5.  
3. Disease progression per Lugano staging26 or clinical parameter s. 
4. Toxicities considered unacceptable by [CONTACT_12692], despi[INVESTIGATOR_12657] . 
5. Development of an inter -current illness that prevents further administration of study 
treatment . 
6. Extraordinary Medical Circumstances: If at any time the constraints of this protocol are 
detrimental to the patient's health, protocol treatment should be discontinued.  
7. Patient withdraws consent  or is unable to comply with study procedures . 
7.[ADDRESS_1022459]  anti-cancer  therapy  will be documented.  
If a patient  is removed from treatment for reason(s) other than progression, follow with 
regular tumor assessments per standard of care until progr ession or start of new treatment  
with the exception of allowed maintenance rituximab. 
For patients who are registered but do not receive any protocol therapy, baseline and follow -
up information per Section 10 will be collected.  
7.3 Criteria for Removal from Study Treatment   
A genuine effort will be made to determine the reason(s) why a patient fails to return for the 
necessary visits or is discontinued from the trial, should this occur. It will be documented whether or not each patient completed the clinical study. If for any patient study treatment or observations were discontinued , the reason will be recorded on the appropriate electronic 
case report form.  Reasons that a patient may discontinue treatment  in a clinical study are 
considered to constitute one of the following:  
1. Recurrence of disease or documented progression of disease. 
2. Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment per investigator discretion.  
3. Unacceptable adverse events.  
4. Treatment interruption of more than 4 weeks  (28 days) . 
5. Investigator and/or patient decision to discontinue treatment . 
6. Pregnancy.  
7. Develops a second malignancy (except for non- melanoma skin cancer or cervical 
carcinoma in- situ) that requires treatment, which would interfere with this study . 
8. The patient may choose to withdraw  from the study at any time for any reason.

unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator.  
10. Severe non- compliance to protocol as judged by [CONTACT_1188]. 
11. Lost to follow -up. 
12. Death.  
13. Closure of study by [CONTACT_12694].  
Any patient who receives at least one dose of study drug (bendamustine, rituximab or 
venetoclax ) will be included in the safety analysis. Patients who discontinue study treatment 
early should be followed for response assessments , if possible. Follow -up will continue per 
Section 10, as applicable.

33 8. Adverse Event Reporting 
8.1 Collection of Safety Infor mation 
Adverse Event  (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of 
a pre- existing medical condition in a patient administered a medicinal product in a clinical 
investigation and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. 
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a product 
(investigational or marketed), whether or not considered related to the product 
(investigational or marketed).  
After informed consent, but prior to initiation of study treatment  (bendamustine, rituximab or 
venetoclax) , only AEs/SAEs caused by a protocol -mandated intervention not considered 
standard of care will be collected (e.g., SAEs related to invasive procedures such as 
biopsies). After the initiation of study treatment, all identified AEs and SAEs must be recorded and described on the appropriate page of the electronic Case Report Form 
(eCRF). If known, the diagnosis  of the underlying illness or disorder should be recorded, 
rather than individual symptoms. The following information should be documented for all AEs: date of onset and resolution, severity of the event; the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_12658] (see definitions below); treatment required for the AE ; 
cause of the event (if known); and information regarding resolution/outcome.  
Only clinically significant laboratory abnormalities that require active management will be  
recorded as AEs or SAEs on the  eCRF (e.g., abnormalities that require  study drug dose 
modification, discontinuation of study treatment, more- frequent follow -up assessments, 
further diagnostic investigation, etc.).  
If the clinically significant laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome (e.g., 
alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin 5x the ULN associated with cholecystitis), only the 
diagnosis (e.g., cholecystitis) needs to be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  
If the clinically significant laboratory abnormality is not a sign of a disease or syndrome, the 
abnormality itself should be recorded as an AE or SAE on the eCRF. If the laboratory abnormality can be characterized by a precise clinical term, the clinical term should be recorded as the AE or SAE. For example, an elevated serum potassium level of 7.0 mEq/L 
should be recorded as “hyperkalemia” . 
Observations of the same clinically significant laboratory abnormality from visit to visit should not be repeatedly recorded as AEs or SAEs on the eCRF  unless their severity, 
seriousness, or etiology changes.  
Severity 
The categories and definitions of severity used for clinical trials AEs are defined in the NCI’s 
Common Terminology Criteria (CTCAE) V5.0 (http://www.ctep.cancer.gov) . 
Attribution  
The following categories and definitions of causal relationship or attribution to study drug 
should be used to assess Adverse Events:  
• Definite: There is a reasonable causal relationship between the study drug and the event. 
The event response to withdrawal of study  drug (dechallenge) and recurs with 
rechallenge, if clinically feasible.  
• Probable: There is a reasonable causal relationship between the study drug and the event. The event responds to dechallenge. Rechallenge is not required.  
• Possible: There is a reasonable causal relationship between the study drug and the event. Dechallenge information is lacking or unclear.  
PrECOG Protocol Number: PrE0405 
IND Number: 143290 
Confidential  
Date: 10/ 11/202 1 
 
34 • Unlikely: There is doubtful causal relationship between the study drug and the event.  
• Unrelated: There is clearly not a causal relationship between the study drug and the 
event or there is a causal relationship between another drug, concurrent disease, or 
circumstances and the event.  
Categories ‘definite’, ‘probable’ and ‘possible’ are considered study drug related. Categories 
‘unlikely’ and ‘unrelated’ are considered not study drug- related.  
The development of a new cancer should be regarded as an AE. New cancers are those 
that are not the primary reason for administration of study treatment and have been identified after inclusion of the patient into the clinical study.  
Expected/Unexpected : Expected AEs are those AEs that are listed or characterized in the 
Package Insert or current Investigator’s Brochure ( IB). 
Unexpected AEs are those not listed in the Package Insert  or current IB or not identified. 
This includes AEs for which the specificity or severity is not consistent with the description 
in the Package Insert  or IB. For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis  would be 
unexpected if the Package Insert  or Investigator ’s Brochure only referred to elevated hepatic 
enzymes or hepatitis.  
Attribution and expected/unexpected should be assessed against the study drug(s) . The 
investigator will determine if event is due to bendamustine, rituximab or venetoclax, disease, etc. 
AEs related to bendamustine, rituximab or venetoclax  should be followed for [ADDRESS_1022460] dose of study therapy until ≤ grade 1 or stabilization, and reported as SAEs if they become serious.  
Any AE’s (serious or not) that occur after the above time periods but are deemed to be at least possibly related to study therapy shall be reported.  
8.[ADDRESS_1022461] medical occurrence occurring after initiation of study 
treatment or that at any dose: 
• results in death (i.e., the adverse event actually causes or leads to death)  
• is life -threatening (defined as an event in which the study patient was at risk of death at 
the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe)  
• requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_312]  
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e., the adverse event results in 
substantial disruption of the subject’s ability to conduct normal life functions)  
• is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be 
immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], based upon 
appropriate medical and scientific judgment, may jeopardize the patient or may require 
intervention (e.g., medical, surgical) to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed 
in the definition above).  
Examples of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not 
result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].

8.[ADDRESS_1022463] (AESI)  
The following adverse events are considered of special interest and must be reported to PrECOG as ser ious adverse events (Section 8.5  for reporting instructions), irrespective of 
regulatory seriousness criteria.  
Non Drug Specific AESIs (applicable to Venetoclax and Rituximab)  
• Drug- Induced Liver Toxicity  
Cases of potential drug- induced liver injury that include an elevated ALT or AST in 
combination with either an elevated bilirubin or clinical jaundice, as defined by [CONTACT_25742]'s Law and based on the following observations:  
o Treatment -emergent ALT or AST >3x baseline value in combination with total 
bilirubin >2x ULN (of which >35% is direct bilirubin)  
o Treatment -emergent ALT or AST >3x baseline value in combination with clinical 
jaundice  
Criteria for Hy’s Law (FDA G uidance 2009)  
- The drug causes hepatocellular injury, generally shown by a higher incidence 
of 3- fold or greater elevations above the ULN  of ALT or AST than the 
(non- hepatotoxic) control drug or placebo. 
- Among trial subject s showing such aminotransferase elevations, often with 
aminotransferases  much greater than 3x ULN, one or more also show elevation  
of serum total bilirubin to >2x ULN, wi thout initial findings of cholestasis 
(elevated serum alkaline phosphatase) . 
- No other reason can be found to explain the combination of increased 
aminotransferases and total bilirubin, such as viral hepatitis A, B, or C; pre-
existing or acute liver disease; or another drug capable of causing the observed injury.  
• Suspected transmission of an infectious agent by [CONTACT_104841], as defined below : 
o Any organism, virus, or infectious particle (e.g., prion protein transmitting transmissible spongiform encephalopathy), pathogenic or non- pathogenic, is 
considered an infectious agent. A transmission of an infectious agent may be suspected from clinical symptoms or laboratory findings that indicate an infection in a patient exposed to a medicinal product. This term applies only when a 
contamination of study treatment is suspected. 
Venetoclax Events of Special Interest  
• Any grade tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) 
o Definitions for TLS is described in Appendix IV: “Definition of Tumor Lysis 
Syndrome”31. Please note that, if the clinical scenario fits for TLS, use these criteria 
for evaluating renal and electrolyte imbalances occurring at the same time.  
- Laboratory TLS  (2 or more metabolic abnormalities present)  = Grade 3  
- Clinical TLS (laboratory TLS must also be present)  = Grade 4

reported to PrECOG  on a Second Primary Cancer  form within 30 days of diagnosis, 
regardless of relationship to protocol treatment. Secondary primary malignancies should also be reported as a SAE. The SAE form is not for use for reporting recurrence or development of metastatic disease. A copy of the pathology report, if applicable, should be sent, if available.  
NOTE : Once data regarding survival and remission status are no longer required by [CONTACT_760], no follow -up data should be submitted.  
8.8 Procedures in Case of Pregnancy  
Prior to study enrollment, women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) and male patients with a female partner of childbearing potential must be advised of the importance of avoiding pregnancy during trial participation and the potential risk factors for an unintentional 
pregnancy, documented in the informed consent. In addition, all WOCBP should be instructed to contact [CONTACT_12696] (e.g., missed or late menstrual period) at any time during study partic ipation.  
Pregnancy of a female patient or the female partner of a male patient  occurring whil e the 
patient is receiving study drug or within 12 months  after the patient’s last dose of study drug 
will be reported to PrECOG  on a Pregnancy Form within 24 hours of the investigator’s 
knowledge of the pregnancy.  
All reports of congenital abnormalities/birth defects and spontaneous miscarriages should also be reported and handled as SAEs. Elective abortions without complications should not be handled as AEs.  
The outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth including health of the newborn or congenital abnormality) must be followed and 
documented on the Pregnancy Form even if the subject was discontinued from the study 
treatment. Should pregnancy occur during a subject’s participation, the subject will immediately be discontinued from the treatment and followed per protocol.  
The study -specific Pregnancy F orm can be found in the Study Reference Manual.  
PrECOG will notify Genentech of any pregnancy within 1 business day of the Awareness 
Date.

before Cycle 3 or 4 should be done per institution guidelines. End of treatment PET/CT 
should be performed 6- 8 weeks after the final cycle of therapy  (6-8 weeks after Cycle 6 Day 
1) and is the primary endpoint for this study. Bone marrow biopsy and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_747282]. 
Any progression on therapy should be confirmed with PET/CT.  
After the End of treatment PET/CT, all other imaging will be per institution standards. 
Patients  will be followed until progression or for up to 5 years  from treatment discontinuation 
or study closure. 
9.2 Lymphoma Response Criteria (Lugano Classification)32 
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using international criterial 
proposed by [CONTACT_941] 11th International Conference on Malignant Lymphoma in Lugano 
Switzerland (Lugano Classification).32 
The criteria use Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR), Stable disease (SD) or 
Progressive Disease (PD) to evaluate response.  PET/CT is the primary modality to measure 
response and will be utilized for the primary outcomes; however, CT without PET component may be adequate at other measurements.  
Tumor measurements will be recorded at baseline for at least [ADDRESS_1022476] diameter and the other its perpendicular counterpart.  
Measurements of lesions will be done at baseline and at each disease assessment.  
Non- target lesions can be utilized also. These may be dominant lesions over 6 nodes 
identified or lesions which are seen but difficult to measure (i .e., a bone lesion with FDG 
activity bu t no clearly defined borders). Non-target lesions will be recorded as present or 
absent.  
Spleen size, in cranio- caudal cross sectional measurement, should be recorded at each 
disease assessment.  
Full criteria can be found in Appendix V: Revised Criteria for Response Assessment .
32 
End of treatment PET/CT is the primary response assessment. A 5-point scale, also known 
as the Deauville criteria, (Table 9-1) should be utilized to measure FDG uptake and 
treatment response via PET. Each target lesion should have a Deauville score at the end of treatment.

primary outcome for this study. It is defined as a complete metabolic response via PET/CT as well as a morphologically negative bone marrow biopsy and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]. Bone marrow flow cytometry should not be utilized in CR assessments . If bone 
marrow biopsy and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_747283], a repeat bone marrow biopsy and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_747284] (PET/CT imaging alone will suffice).  
All other responses, including PR, SD, PD and CT based criteria  are indicated 
in the Lugano Criteria, listed in A ppendix V  Revised Criteria for Response 
Assessment.
32 
9.3 Minimum Residual Disease (MRD) Measurements  
MRD negative rate at the end of treatment assessment are exploratory endpoints in this study. MRD will be measured using PCR based markers through Adaptive  Biotechnologies 
(clonoSEQ ) on tumor tissue (baseline only), liquid marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_747285] . 
Baseline tumor tissue sample will be obtained. If tumor tissue is not available, bone marrow 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_747286] , if involved with mantle cell lymphoma,  for 
baseline comparison sample.  If baseline samples (blocks/slides, bone marrow, and/or 
peripheral blood) are not submitted at baseline for MRD  (i.e., not involved with mantle cell 
lymphoma) , then patients will be allowed to remain on study but MRD samples will not be 
collected during the study.  
Bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_747287]. Please note,  if bone marrow is positive for mantle cell lymphoma at baseline, an 
end of treatment bone marrow must  be collected to confirm response.  
Peripheral blood for MRD assessments will be collected at the end of treatment.

Please refer to the current Investigator’s Brochure for additional information.  
11.1.9  Side Effects  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Tumor Lysis Syndrome 
TLS is a risk for patients with MCL  who are treated with high cell -killing 
agents, including venetoclax. The highest risk for TLS occurs within the first 
24 hours of a dose escalation caused by [CONTACT_747310] . Refer 
to Section 5.3 for Tumor Lysis Prophylaxis and Section 5.4 for Tumor Lysis 
Monitoring. 
NOTE : Defined risks for TLS are not clear in MCL but some higher risk 
situations include:  
 Bulky disease (any lymph node mass >10 cm)  
 Circulating mantle cell lymphoma with ALC >25 x 10
9/L 
 Borderline renal function  
 Rapi[INVESTIGATOR_32660].  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Neutropenia  
Neutropenia is an important identified risk for venetoclax, specifically in CLL. 
Clinical data from the oncology studies suggest that the neutropenia adverse events are observed among subjects who receive venetoclax as a single agent or in combination with other therapeutic agents, with slightly higher frequency observed in some combination studies. Serious adverse events of neutropenia or neutropenia events that lead to discontinuations 
are few across the entire venetoclax oncology program.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Infections  
Infections have been reported in the oncology clinical studies; however, 
these events are confounded by [CONTACT_54648], comorbidities, an d 
other immunosuppressive medications. To date, no clear relationship has 
been noted between serious infectious events and neutropenia. The types

IND Number: 143290 
Confidential  
Date: 10/ 11/[ADDRESS_1022494] of care (e.g., National 
Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines [NCCN] for oncology subjects).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Anemia  
Anemia has been reported in the oncology studies with slightly higher 
frequency in some studies in which venetoclax is combined with other chemotherapeutic agents; however, most of the events were nonserious 
and confounded by [CONTACT_747311][INVESTIGATOR_014].  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Thrombocytopenia  
Thrombocytopenia adverse events have been reported in the oncology 
studies, with slightly higher frequency in studies in which venetoclax  is 
combined with other chemotherapeutic agents.  However, most of the events 
were nonserious and assessment of these events is confounded by [CONTACT_13935]’ underlying disease states, prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and preexisting thrombocytopenia, including autoimmune thrombocytopenia, in several patients.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Lymphopenia  
Lymphopenia has been observed in nonclinical studies with venetoclax. 
While opportunistic infections have been reported in the clinical program, 
data are confounded by [CONTACT_1962]’ underlying disease and prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
If clinically indicated, anti -infective prophylaxis should be implemented, 
including appropriate prophylaxis for viral, fungal, bacterial, or 
Pneumocystis  jiroveci  pneumonia infections.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reproductive System Effects  
Based on nonclinical studies, there is a potential for decreased spermatogenesis. Male patients considering preservation of fertility should bank sperm before treatment with venetoclax. Long- term effects of 
venetoclax on female reproductive potential are unknown.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Treatment -Emergent Malignancies (Second Primary Malignancies)  
Events of second primary malignancies have been reported across the oncology program. No pattern has been was observed. As venetoclax is being evaluated in patients with relapsed/refractory  (R/R) disease who had 
previously been treated with various cytotoxic agents, second primary malignancies should be closely monitored.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Food Effect  
Administration with a low-fat meal incr eased venetoclax exposure by 
[CONTACT_3450] 3.4-fold an d administration with a high-fat meal incr eased 
venetoclax exposure by 5.1- to 5.3-fold compare d to fasting conditions .

inducers of CYP3A  or P-gp inhibitors  is prohibited . Co- administration with 
weak CYP3A inhibitors and inducers  is allowed.  P-gp substrate should be 
avoided. If a concomitant use is unavoidable, separate dosing of the P -gp 
substrate at least 6 hours before venetoclax.  
In cycles 2- 6 when venetoclax will not be administered (i.e., Days 11- 28), 
avoid the use of strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors or P -gp inhibitors [ADDRESS_1022495] 7 days prior to the next cycle 
of venetoclax treatment.  (Section 6.2.2 and Appendix III: Additional 
Excluded and Cautionary Medications ). 
Live attenuated vaccines should not be administered prior to, during, or 
after treatment  with venetoclax until B -cell recovery occurs.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Overdose  
There is no specific  antidote for venetoclax . For patients  who experience 
overdose,  closely  monitor  and provide appropriate supportive treatment;  
during ramp- up phase interrupt  venetoclax  and monitor carefully  for signs  
and symptoms  of TLS along with other toxicities . 
11.1.10  Nursing/Patient Implications

11.2.8  Drug Interactions  
Bendamustine is a substrate for the cytochrome P450(CYP) 1A2 isoenzyme.  
Bendamustine is metabolized to minimally active metabolites by [CONTACT_097]1A2. Concurrent administration of a CYP1A2 inhibitor such as atazanavir, cimetidine, ciprofloxacin, 
fluvoxamine, mexiletine, tacrine, thiabendazole, zileuton, norfloxacin, and/or ethinyl

Bendamustine is metabolized to minimally active metabolites by [CONTACT_097]1A2. Concurrent 
administration of a CYP1A2 inducer  such as barbiturates, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], and/or 
rifampin may cause a decrease in bendamustine plasma concentrations and a potential decrease in cytotoxicity. The parent compounds are believed to be primarily 
responsible for the cytotoxicity of this agent. Caution should be exercised, or 
alternative treatments considered, when co- administering bendamustine with a 
CYP1A2 inducer.  
Bendamustine is metabolized to minimally active metabolites by [CONTACT_097]1A2. Smoking

54 12. Statistical Considerations 
12.1 Study Design,  Sample Size Considerations  & Statistical Analyses  
12.1.1  Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoint of this single arm Phase II study is  CR rate after 6 cycles of BR 
+ venetoclax. A 15% improvement in t he historical post -induction CR rate of 70% to 
85% is of interest. A total of 56 patients  will be enrolled, 53 of whom are expected to 
be eligible and treated.  There will be 90% power to detect the 15% improvement in 
CR rate from 70% using one-sided exact binomial test with 10% Type I error . This 
treatment combination will be considered worthy  of further investigation if 42 or more 
eligible and treated patients achieve  CR. The efficacy population consists of all eligible 
and treated patients.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Revised Study Design  
Preliminary data from a similar cohort of patients as that enrolled in this 
study indicates that post -induction CR rate is 60%, not 70% as initially 
assumed. In addition, the observed study accrual rate (1.1 patients/month) 
is significantly lower than the planned/expected study accrual rate of 2.3 
patients/month. For both reasons, the study was redesigned to reflect the current historical CR rate and with a lowered sample size for prompt primary endpoint readout. Accrual before this redesign is 25 patients  as of 
10/11/2021. 
With a revised accrual goal of 33 patients, 32 patients expected to be eligible 
and treated, there is 81.8% power and 11.6% alpha using exact binomi al 
test to detect a 17% difference in CR rate from 60% to 77%. The null 
hypothesis will be rejected, and treatment combination declared positive if 
≥ 23 (71.9%)  CRs are observed among 32 eligible and treated patients.  
12.1.2  Secondary Endpoints  
Secondary endpoints include progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival 
(OS). PFS  is defined as time from r egistration to disease progression or death from 
any cause, whichever occurs first . Patients that are alive and progression free at the 
time of analysis will be censored at the date of last disease assessment. OS is defined 
as time from registration  to death; patients will be censored at the time of last study 
contact. PFS and OS will be estimated using Kaplan -Meier methodology  and 90% 
confidence interval (CI) around estimates will be presented. Appropriate descriptive 
measures will be used to describe clinical and demographic variables.  
12.2 Planned Analyses  
12.2.1 T oxicity Monitoring  Plan  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Tumor Lysis Syndrome 
Tumor Lysis Syndrome ( TLS) is an event of interest in this study. TLS risk 
factors are listed in Section 5.3,  TLS monitoring plan is detailed in Section 
5.4 and “Definitions for Tumor Lysis Syndrome” noted in Appendix IV. The 
risk for TLS will be assessed among the first [ADDRESS_1022503] 3 cycles with no hold 
to accrual . Given the expected clinical TLS rate of 5%, the probability of 
observing at least one clinical TLS among 19 patients is 62%, and 82% 
among 33 patients.  
  
PrECOG Protocol Number: PrE0405 
IND Number: 143290 
Confidential  
Date: 10/ 11/202 1 
 
55 A TLS incidence rate of no more than 15% ( ≤ 3 out of 19 patients) i s 
permissible on this study. If the observed TLS is ≥ 21% (≥ 4 out of 19 
patients) then a detailed review of TLS cases will be conducted by [CONTACT_747312] (DSMB). This is the boundary and the DSMB could 
recommend closing the study due to high incidence of TLS. If the true 
incidence of TLS is 30% or higher, there is at least 87% probability of crossing the boundary. Whereas, if the true incidence of TLS is 10% there is only 11% chance of crossing the boundary.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Non- Diseas e Related Death on Treatment  
Deaths during induction have been reported in prior studies with BR and 
novel combinations, particularly bortezomib and lenalidomide.
13,14 The 
combined rate of non- disease related death in these studies is 
approximately 5.5%, which is considered unacceptable. Non- disease 
related death, defined as death from any cause not due to mantle cell 
lymphoma and occurring at any time from Cycle 1, Day 1 to end of 
treatment , will be monitored during the study and each event will be reporte d 
to the DSMB. In addition to reporting each non- disease related death event 
to the DSMB for review, the cumulative observed number of events will be assessed, based on the presented operating characteristics, at specific accrual stages specified in the table below. These accrual stages include 
after 19, 28,  and 33 patients enrollment . If at any of the accrual stages the 
specified boundary for that stage is crossed, the study will pause enrollment and await DSMB review and recommendations. During the review, the DSMB may decide that a death event is not related to treatment and may exclude the event from further calculations (i.e. accident or suicide).  
From the table, at the 19 patient  enrollment and treatment milestone,  the 
expected number of non- disease related death is 1 (based on the 5.5% rate 
reported from referenced studies). If ≥ 2 such death events occur (i.e. boundary is crossed) among 19 patients then the DSMB will review all non-disease related death cases. There is 8.1%, 28.1%, 45.6%, 58.0%, 68.3%, and 80.2% probability of crossing the boundary if the true underlying non-disease related death rate is 2.5%, 5.5%, 8%, 10%, 12%, and 15% 
respectively.  
If at any time there are greater than 5 non- disease related deat hs during 
induction, the study may  close for safety. If the true non- disease related 
death rate is 5.5% then the probability of observing >5 events among 33 
patients is only 0.8%. Whereas the probability of observing >5 events is 
10.6% if the true n on-disease related death rate is 10%, and 67.1% if the 
true underlying death rate is 20%.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Other Toxicity  
Toxicity and adverse events for all enrolled patients will be monitored 
throughout the conduct of the study. Toxicity rates, with 90% exact binomial 
CIs, will be estimated for all enrolled patients who received at least one cycle of treatment, irrespective of eligibility. These rates will be estimated for Grade 3 or higher treatment -related toxicities using CTCAE Version 5.0. If 
all 33 patients are treated, the maximum width of a 90% exact CI on the rate 
of Grade 3 or higher treatment -related toxicities will be no wider than 31%. 
The probability of observing at least one rare toxicity event (given a true rate of 5%) is 81.6%. The DSMB will review safety data and may halt the study 
for safety if any grade 4 or higher specific toxicity occurs with an incidence rate of >30% . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Study and Safety Monitoring Plan  
This study will be monitored by [CONTACT_747313]. The D SMB meets twice 
each year , or as frequently as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_4318]. For each 
meeting, all monitored studies are reviewed for toxicity  and progress toward 
completion. If a safety concern is identified, the DSMB  may recommend 
halting or permanently stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_747291].  
12.2.2 Analyses of Correlative Studies  
Minimum Residual Disease (MRD)  will be analyzed as a binary endpoint an d 90% 
exact CI  around the estimated MRD negative rate will be reported. This estimate will 
also be reported within levels of response to BR + venetoclax treatment.

60 [IP_ADDRESS]  Remaining Peripheral Blood Samples to Central Lab  
Red Top Tube  (10 mL)  Processing for Serum  
Gently mix the blood sample by [CONTACT_8536] 5 times (do not shake). Allow the 
sample to sit at room temperature for 30- 60 minutes in vertical positon until 
a clot has formed. If the blood is not centrifuged immediately after the 
clotting time (30- 60 minutes at room temperature), the tubes should be 
refrigerated (4°C) for no longer than 4 hours.  
Once the clot has formed, the sample is ready for centrifugation. Centrifuge for 15 minutes at room temperature at 1200 RPM  or per institutional 
practices . Immediately aliquot and store the resulting serum into two (2) 
properly labeled polypropylene tubes. Be careful to not disturb the clot. Store the samples in the freezer at -80°C until they are shipped to the  CBPF . 
EDTA Tube  (6 mL) Processing for Plasma and Buffy Coat  
**Samples should be processed within 4 hours, but at limit of 
processing being same day ** 
• Gently mix blood sample by [CONTACT_8536] 10 times (do not shake).  
• Place tube immediately on wet ice for 5 minutes.  
• Centrifuge at 1200 RPM for 15 minutes at 4° C. If a refrigerated 
centrifuge is not available, spin sample at room temperature (1200 RPM for 15 minutes)  or per institutional practices . Immediately place the tube 
on wet ice after centrifugation.  
After centrifugation, the plasma layer will be at the top half of the tube. The 
nucleated cells (WBC) will be in a whitish layer, called the “buffy coat”, just 
under the plasma and above the red blood cells.  
Plasma  Preparation:  
• Using a transfer pi[INVESTIGATOR_12674]- thirds of the plasma and 
transfer plasma into a 15 mL conical centrifuge tube, be careful not to 
disturb the buffy coat layer in the EDTA tube ( NOTE:  see below for buffy 
coat processing instructions). Centrifuge the 15 mL conical tube at 1200 
RPM for 15 minutes at 4° C. If a refrigerated centrifuge is not available, 
spin sample at room temperature (1200 RPM for 15 minutes). Immediately place the conical tube on wet ice after centrifugation.  
• Transfer equal amounts of plasma into two (2) properly labeled 
polypropylene tubes for cryopreservation being careful not to disturb the 
small PBMC/pellet . 
• Store the two aliquots of plasma samples in the freezer at ≤ -80°C or 
colder until they are shipped to the CBPF . 
Buffy Coat Preparation: 
• From the EDTA tube remove and aliquot the “buffy coat”; be careful not 
to disturb the layer of  red blood cells.  
• Store the  aliquot of cells in one (1)  properly labeled polypropylene tube 
for cryopreservation.  
• Store the sample in the freezer at  ≤ -80°C or colder until it is sh ipped to 
the CBPF .

Definitions of Tumor Lysis Syndrome  
Metabolic Abnormality  Criteria for Classification of 
Laboratory Tumor Lysis Syndrome * Criteria for Classification of Clinical Tumor 
Lysis Syndrome * 
Hyperuricemia  Uric acid >8.0 mg/ dl (475.8 μmol/liter) 
in adults.   
Hyperphosphatemia  Phosphorus >4.5 mg/dl (1.5 mmol/  liter) 
in adults .  
Hyperkalemia   Cardiac dysrhythmia or sudden death probably 
or definitely caused by [CONTACT_496446]. 
Hypocalcemia  Corrected calcium <7.0 mg/dl (1.75 
mmol/liter) or ionized calcium <1.12 
(0.3 mmol/liter)†  Cardiac dysrhythmia, sudden death, seizure, 
neuromuscular irritability (tetany, paresthesias, 
muscle twitching, carpo pedal spasm, 
Trousseau’s sign, Chvostek’s sign, 
laryngospasm, or bronchospasm), hypotension, 
or heart failure probably or definitely caused by 
[CONTACT_403479] . 
Acute Kidney I njury‡  N/A Increase in the serum creatinine level of 0.3 
mg/dl (26.5 μmol/liter) (or a single value >1.5x  
the upper limit of the age appropriate normal 
range if no baseline creatinine measurement is 
available) or the presence of oliguria, defined as an average urine output of <0.5 mL/kg/hr for 6 hr . 
* In laboratory tumor lysis syndrome, two or more metabolic abnormalities must be present during the same 24-hour 
period within [ADDRESS_1022524] (Grade 3) . Clinical tumor lysis syndrome 
requires the presence of laboratory tumor lysis syndrome plus an  increased creatinine level, seizures, cardiac 
dysrhythmia, or death (Grade 4 or Grade 5[death]) . 
† The corrected calcium level in milligrams per deciliter = measured calcium level in milligrams per deciliter + 0.8 × 
(4 – albumin in grams per deciliter). 
‡ Acute kidney injury is defined as an increase in the creatinine level of at least 0.3 mg per deciliter (26.5 μmol per liter) or a period of oliguria lasting 6 hours or more. By [CONTACT_108], if acute kidney injury is present, the patient has 
clinical tumor lysis syndrome if no other cause can be found .

Response and 
Site PET-CT–Based Response  CT-Based Response  
Complete  Complete Metabolic R esponse  Complete Radiologic Response  
(all of the following)  
 Score 1, 2, or 3*- with or without a residual mass on 
5PS† Target nodes/nodal masses must regress 
to ≤ 1.5 cm in LDi  
Lymph Nodes and 
Extralymphatic S ites It is recognized that in Waldeyer's ring or extranodal  
sites with high physiologic uptake or with activation 
within spleen or marrow (e.g. , with chemotherapy or 
myeloid colony -stimulating factors), uptake may be 
greater than normal mediastinum and/or liver. In this 
circumstance, complete metabolic response may be 
inferred if uptake at sites of initial involvement is no greater than surrounding normal tissue even if the tissue has high physiologic uptake. No extralymphatic sites of disease  
Nonmeasured L esion  Not applicable  Absent  
Organ E nlargement  Not applicable  Regress to normal  
New L esions  None  None  
Bone M arrow No evidence of FDG -avid disease in marrow  Normal by [CONTACT_5293]; if indeterminate, 
IHC negative  
Partial Partial Metabolic R esponse  Partial Remission  
(all of the following)  
Lymph Nodes and 
Extralymphatic S ites Score 4 or 5† with reduced uptake compared with 
baseline and residual mass(es) of any size  ≥ 50% decrease in SPD of up to [ADDRESS_1022525], assign 5 mm × 5 mm as the default 
value  
 At end of treatment, these findings indicate residual 
disease  When no longer visible, 0 × 0 mm  
  
For a node > 5 mm × 5 mm, but smaller than 
normal, use actual measurement for 
calculation  
Nonmeasured 
Lesions  Not applicable  Absent/normal, regressed, but no increase  
Organ E nlargement  Not applicable  Spleen must have regressed by > 50% in 
length beyond normal  
New L esions  None  None  
Bone M arrow Residual uptake higher than uptake in  normal 
marrow but reduced compared with baseline (diffuse 
uptake compatible with reactive changes from 
chemotherapy allowed). If there are persistent focal 
changes in the marrow in the context of a nodal 
response, consideration should be given to further 
evaluation with MRI or biopsy or an interval scan . Not applicable

75 Abbreviations:  5PS, 5 -point scale; CT, computed tomography; FDG, fluorodeoxyglucose; IHC, immunohistochemistry; 
LDi, longest transverse diameter of a lesion; MRI, magnetic resonance imaging; PET, positron emission tomography; [COMPANY_003], 
cross product of the LDi and perpendicular diameter; SDi, shortest axis perpendicular to the LDi; SPD, sum of the product 
of the perpendicular diameters for multiple lesions.  
* A score of [ADDRESS_1022530] treatment, especially if at the time 
of an interim scan. However, in trials involving PET where de- escalation is investigated, it may be 
preferable to consider a score of 3 as inadequate response (to avoid undertreatment).  
- Measured dominant lesions: Up to six of the largest dominant nodes, nodal masses, and extranodal 
lesions selected to be clearly measurable in two diameters. Nodes should preferably be from disparate 
regions of the body and should include, where applicable, mediastinal and retroperitoneal areas. Non -
nodal lesions include those in solid organs (e .g., liver, spleen, kidneys, lungs), GI involvement, 
cutaneous lesion s, or those noted on palpation.  
- Nonmeasured lesions: Any disease not selected as measured, dominant disease and truly assessable 
disease should be considered not measured. These sites include any nodes, nodal masses, and 
extranodal sites not selected as dominant or measurable or that do not meet the requirements for 
measurability but are still considered abnormal, as well as truly assessable disease, which is any site 
of suspected disease that would be difficult to follow quantitatively with measurement, including pleural 
effusi ons, ascites, bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, abdominal masses, and other lesions that 
cannot be con firmed and followed by [CONTACT_9661].  
- In Waldeyer's ring or in extranodal sites (e.g. , GI tract, liver, bone marrow), FDG uptake may be greater 
than in the mediastinum with complete metabolic response, but should be no higher than surrounding 
normal physiologic uptake (e.g. , with marrow activation as a result of chemotherapy or myeloid growth 
factors).  
† PET 5 PS: 
1. No uptake above background  
2. Uptake ≤ mediastinum  
3. Uptake >mediastinum but ≤ liver  
4. Uptake moderately >liver  
5. Uptake markedly higher  than liver and/or new lesions  
6. X: new areas of uptake unlikely to be related to lymphoma.

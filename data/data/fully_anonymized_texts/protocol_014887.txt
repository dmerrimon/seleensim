Primary cervical dystonia (PCD) is the most common form of focal dystonia.1 PCD is frequently reported as a 
source of disability,2 decreased quality of life ,3 and social stigma .4  Botulinum toxin (BoNT) is the gold standard 
treatment for PCD (Class I evidence, Level A recommendations) .[ADDRESS_834449] of care is injecting no more 
frequently than every 12 weeks to re duce the risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_414773], patients commonly report fading of 
benefits sooner than 12 weeks following the injection.5 We conducted a retrospective analysis of PCD patients 
injected with BoNT at our center (n=150). We found the average duration o f benefits from BoNT injections was 
about 9.[ADDRESS_834450] -line approach for treatment of PCD, in many patients it provides only suboptimal benefits. 
Therefore there is clearly a merit in exploring other options to potentiate and possibly prolong the benefits of 
BoNT therapy.  
 
We propose to use repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation  (rTMS ) therapy as an adjunctive therapy in 
combination with BoNT injections as a novel approach to treat PCD. rTMS refers to the application of transcranial 
magnetic stimulation (TMS) pulses to a specific target  at predefined stimulation parameters.7-[ADDRESS_834451] weeks after the conclusion of the rTMS sessions. For example, in a recent double blind randomized 
controlled study, low frequency rTMS delivered over eight we eks to Parkinson’s disease patients showed positive 
clinical benefits that lasted for [ADDRESS_834452] treatment, the peak -dose benefits seen with BoNT are se en at about 4 -6 
weeks after the administration of injections. We plan to introduce a 1 week course of rTMS around 2-8 weeks 
before or after BoNT or T1). We may examine the effects of combined therapy at around 10 weeks after BoNT 
(T2) and at around12 weeks after BoNT (T3) injections follow -up (Figure A).  We will record the clinical 
outcome with the Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS), a s tandardized validated 
rating scale for PCD. We will also measure the physiological effects at these time points with transcranial 
magnetic stimulation (TMS) technique, a useful tool to understand the brain physiology. We will measure the 
effects of rTMS on  cerebellar excitability with a well-established TMS parameter referred to as  cerebellar 
inhibition (CBI). As mentioned in aforementioned section, rTMS  delivered at 1 Hz and below inhibits the brain 
4/20/2015    and when delivered at frequencies greater than 5 Hz, 7,11-13 it excites the brain. Based on previous imaging 
studies that showed increased activation of cerebellum in dystonia, 16-21,28 we plan to use low frequency rTMS 
to achieve inhibition of cerebellum and improvement of symptoms.  
It is reasonable to be con cerned that the alongside the effects of low frequency rTMS on excitatory loops, the 
inhibitory loops in the cerebellum could as well be further inhibited by [CONTACT_112016]. We are therefore planning to 
include the cerebello -cortical inhibition circuit to determine the effects of rTMS on an inhibitory loop.  
SPECIFIC AIM 1:  Clinical impact of rTMS therapy in PCD.   
We will determine the clinical effects of 1-Hz rTMS  therapy of the cerebellum when combined with BoNT 
injections in PCD. Comparisons will be drawn in the clinical scoring of TWSTRS (blinded videotape ratings) 
between T1 ( around 6 weeks after BoNT injections or the start of rTMS therapy), T2 ( around 10 week s after) 
and T3 ( around 12 weeks after  or at the time of next BoNT injection ) assessments. We hypothesize benefits 
seen at T2 follow -up compared to T1 will be greater in the group receiving combined rTMS and BoNT therapy 
compared with standard BoNT alone.  Similar effects will be seen at T3 follow -up but they will be reduced in 
magnitude. (Figure C)  
 
SPECIFIC AIM 2 : Physiological impact of rTMS therapy in PCD  
Aim 2a:  We will determine the physiological  effects of 1-Hz rTMS  therapy when combined with BoNT 
injections in PCD. We will record the time course of effects on cerebellar inhibition (CBI) at T1, T2 and T3 
follow -ups by [CONTACT_626191] . We hypothesize that compared to T1, CBI will be reduced and reach 
physiological leve ls at T2 follow -up. CBI will continue to remain at physiological levels at T3 follow -up though to 
a lesser extent.  
 
Aim 2b: We will determine if the physiological effects of 1-Hz rTMS therapy as reflected in CBI, will correlate 
with the clinical scoring o f PCD symptoms. We hypothesize that the change in CBI measure at T2 and T3 
follow -ups will show positive correlation with the improvement in PCD symptoms at these time points.

4/20/2015    STUDY DESIGN:  Subjects receiving BoNT therapy for a diagnosis of PCD will be enrolled. Diagnosis of PCD 
will be established in accordance with the Consensus Statement of the Movement Disorders Society.27 In this 
two year study, we plan to recruit 20 subjects  with PCD  in the age range 21–80 years. Subjects followed at our 
center regularly fill out a self -reported form to document the duration of benefits they perceive with BoNT therapy. 
We will enroll subjects who report benefits lasting 10 weeks or less only (suboptimal benefits with standa rd care). 
Specifically , our inclusion criteria are : 1) Diagnosis of PCD according to the Consensus Statement of the 
Movement Disorders Society; 2) Report benefits of BoNT lasting 10 weeks or less only. We will exclude subjects 
with 1) pregnancy; 2) active seizure disorder 3) presence of a metallic body such as pacemaker, implants, metal 
rods and hearing aid.   We will also identify subjects who meet inclusion/exclusion criteria from the  IRB 
approved database (#416 -2002).  These subjects have consented to be  contact[CONTACT_5646].  We will 
enroll 10 healthy  age and sex -matched controls for normative electrophysiological data.  Controls will be 
recruited through fliers placed across the campus. Specifically, our inclusion criteria are: 1) There is no hi story 
of any neurological disorders; 2) Neurological exams are unremarkable.  We will exclude subjects with 1) 
pregnancy; 2) any neurological disorders 3) presence of a metallic body such as pacemaker, implants, metal 
rods and hearing aid.    
 
Eligible subje cts will be invited to an introductory session. We will obtain IRB approved informed consent.  
Subjects will be explained in detail about the procedures outlined for the study. Subjects will have a detailed 
medical history and neurological examination usin g the NINDS Common Data Elements.  Subjects will be 
randomized to receive BoNT therapy  combined with real or sham rTMS (1:1, 10 subjects in each arm). At our 
center, PCD subjects  are scheduled for BoNT injections approximately every [ADDRESS_834453] to real rTMS 
versus sham rTMS.   
Outcome measures.  The clinical outcome will be measured with Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating 
Scale (TWSTRS) . The TWSTRS  is a widely accepted composite rating scale for PCD with subscales for clinical 
severity, functional disability, and associated pain. Studies evaluating the clinimetric properties of TWSTRS have 
demonstrated substantial reliability, validity, and responsiv eness to change following therapeutic intervention. It 
is the most commonly employed outcome measure in PCD trials and has practical applicability in a clinical 
setting.  Also, w e will administer the Craniocervical Dystonia Questionnaire Description for qua lity of life 
assessment. The Craniocervical Dystonia Questionnaire (CDQ -24) is a patient -rated health related quality of life 
(HR-QoL) measure for craniocervical  dystonia. It has been validated for use in clinical  research. The CDQ -[ADDRESS_834454] o f Craniocervical  Dystonia on 5 HR -QoL domains. It is composed  of 24 items, forming 5 
subscales: stigma, emotional  well-being, pain, activities of daily living, and social/  family life. Items are rated on 
a 5-point scale.[ADDRESS_834455] two  weeks because of 
dystonia by [CONTACT_626192]. Subjects will also rate their symptoms before and 
after stimulation using a 7 -point nominal scale: 1) excellent, 2) very good, 3) good, 4) average, 5) slightly worse 
than usual, 6) bad or 7) very bad.  
We will record videos of subj ects at T1, and possibly at T2 and T3 time points which will be scored by [CONTACT_626193]  (excluding control patients) . We will obtain IRB approval to consent subjects in order 
to obtain videos of all subjects  (excluding control subjects) . The physiological outcome will be measured with 
TMS (CBI measure). We will also obtain MRI scan before and after rTMS therapy . 
Brain Structure Measures: We will be using the research dedicated 3T Phillips or 3T Siemens MRI scanners 
in the McKnight Brain Inst itute to obtain diffusion tensor imaging, T1 weighted, and T2 weighted images. 21  We 
will be using the 32 channel head coil (Phillips) or 64 channel head coil (Siemens) for data acquisition.   
Brain Function Measures: We will be using the research dedicated 3T Phillips or 3T Siemens MRI scanners 
at the McKnight Brain Institute to obtain functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data during the 
production of grip force production tasks22-24.  Participants will use their hand to squeeze an MRI compatible 
4/20/2015    grip force transducer in the MRI unit.  This is a fiber optic transducer that is fully compatibl e with MRI.  When 
producing force, the participants will view the amount of force they generate when viewing the visual feedback 
on a MRI compatible visual display while lying inside the scanner.  
RTMS THERAPY:  
Real stimulation: Repetitive -TMS will be deli vered over each cerebellar hemisphere, using a  NeuroStar TMS 
therapy  system (Neuronetics , Malvern , PA, [LOCATION_003] ).22 This coil , delivering TMS pulses to the patient’s brain,  will 
be positioned over a point that is 3 cm lateral to the inion on the line joining the inion and the external auditory 
meatus . The coil position will be  marked on the skin. 900 pulses will be delivered consecutively to each side 
with a frequency of 1 Hz and at an intensity of 90% of the resting motor threshold (RMT) for  a total duration of 
[ADDRESS_834456] stimulation intensity required to 
evoke a 50 μV potential in a target muscle (i.e. first dorsal interosseus muscle in our case). Constant coil 
position will be  continuously mon itored during the experiment.  During rTMS, all patients will wear ear plugs in 
order to  protect the ears from the acoustic artefact associated  with the discharge of the stimulation coil.  A 
similar protocol will be observed for the contralateral cerebellum.   
Sham Stimulation : Patients will undergo the same procedure for identifying stimulus location used in patients 
receiving real rTMS. Simulated rTMS will be administered using NeuroStar TMS therapy  system coil which 
produces discharge noise and vibration without stimulating the cerebral cortex. This technique has been 
suggested to provide more effective  blinding compared to other methods use in previous controlled studies .23 
Safety of rTMS : Repetitive TMS can have undesired side effects .[ADDRESS_834457], and all subjects will provide 
informed consent. The study is highly f easible given the large number of PCD subjects seen at UF and the  
considerable expertise. Statistical analyses will be performed using commercially available statistical software  
(SPSS, version 19.0; SPSS, Inc., Chicago, Illinois). We aim to enroll [ADDRESS_834458] a mixed model analysis using time and stimulation arm as 
repeated factors adjusted for baseline values, and subjects as the random factor. The model will include 2 
factors : treatment (2 levels: real vs sham) and time (3 levels: T1, T1, and T3). The [ADDRESS_834459] to determine the relation between the 
change in CBI at T2 compared to that at T1  and change in CBI at T3 compared to that at T1. With an expected 
difference of 30% in TWSTRS scores at 10 weeks between the two arms (real and sham rTMS), a standard 
deviation of 20%, type I error of 5% and power of 80%, the necessary sample size for each  group is  ten 
completers.

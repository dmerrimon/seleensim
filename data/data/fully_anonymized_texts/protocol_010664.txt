1. PURPOSE OF THE STUDY AND BACKGROUND  
 
1.1. Background  
Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is a demonstrably effective device intervention for patients with broad 
QRS and ventricular dysfunction and is a class I indication for patients in sinus rhythm, LBBB and EF ≤ 30 -35%.  
However, many patients with hear t failure (HF) are unable to maintain sinus rhythm and approximately 30 -36% 
of CRT patients are in atrial fibrillation (AF). Unfortunately, there is lack of evidence for the benefits of CRT in the 
absence of sinus rhythm. The recent RAFT study in patients with less advanced HF found no benefit at all for CRT 
for permanent AF patients although most patients did not achieve sufficient biventricular pacing.  
Approximately 100,[ADDRESS_1134390] of approximately $1.[ADDRESS_1134391] that only CRT patients with AF who undergo 
atrioventricular junctional (AVJ) ablation can respond as well as patients in sinus rhythm. AVJ ablation 
regularizes rhy thm, eliminates tachycardia, and forces 100% biventricular pacing without fusion or 
pseudofusion. In the absence of a randomized clinical trial, however, there are concerns regarding making a 
significant proportion of CRT patients pacemaker dependent. It i s believed that AVJ ablation is performed in only 
small numbers of patients at the present time.  
We propose a randomized controlled clinical trial in 40 subjects with permanent AF who are eligible for cardiac 
resynchronization therapy with defibrillator (C RT-D) to test the benefit of AVJ ablation on clinical outcome.  
 
1.2. Purpose of the study  
The primary aim of the study is:  
 To determine if patien ts with permanent AF who meet conventional criteria for CRT -D and undergo AVJ 
ablation have improved left ventricular remodeling as assessed by [CONTACT_358025]-systolic volume 
reduction ≥ 15% from baseline to 6 months . 
The secondary aims of this study are:  
 To determine if subjects with permanent AF who meet conventional criteria for CRT -D and undergo  AVJ 
ablation, relative to subjects without AVJ ablation, have:  
1. Improved left ventricular ejection fraction  
2. Diminished left ventricular end-diastolic volume  
3. Lower risk of heart failure requiring augmented oral or IV treatment regimen during an in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_819088] a formal inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]  
4. Lower likelihood of experiencing inappropriate implantable cardioverter -defibrillator ( ICD) therapy  
5. Lower risk of ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation ( VF) requiring appropriate ICD 
therapy  
6. Higher percentage of biventricular pacing  
7. Improved quality of life  
8. Acceptable safety and complication rate in this high -risk heart failure population

proposal is not designed to assess clinical benefit measured by [CONTACT_819108][INVESTIGATOR_198619], but obtaining proof of concept by [CONTACT_819109] a more definitive study. Testing the hypothesis that AVJ ablation will result in much more 
effective CRT pacing is very much needed in light of widespread use of CRT in AF patients without sufficient 
scientific proof. Knowing that 36% of CRT -D patients present in AF, the economic impact of treatment optimized 
by [CONTACT_819110] r health care (assuming the trial prove s the hypothesis).  
Furthermore, since a prior study suggests that even a high percentage of biventricular pacing in the absence of 
AVJ ablation may not provide for the best possible outcomes from CRT, the proposed st udy is not only 
scientifically appropriate but also ethically sound.

CRT-D Implantation and Programming:  For subjects having an index device procedure, t he CRT -D will be 
implanted following clinically approved indications using standard techniques and leads will be placed in the 
right ventricle (RV) and the coronary sinus for biventricular (BiV) pacing.  In case left ventr icular ( LV) lead cannot 
be positioned in the coronary sinus, direct epi[INVESTIGATOR_819092] 8 of 21   Version 4.0                                                       September 26, 2018  For primary prevention subjec ts (indicated for ICD without prior cardiac arrest or hemodynamically 
compromising VT/VF) , ICD programming should follow parameters shown in Table [ADDRESS_1134401] been shown to reduce the risk of inappropriate and appropriate ICD therapi[INVESTIGATOR_819093]. For secondary prevention subjec ts (indicated for ICD due to prior cardiac arrest o r 
hemodynamically compromising VT/VF) , the ventricular tachycardia zone should  be programmed at a rate 
commensurate with the subject ’s documented clinical arrhythmia; however, the ventricular fibrillation zone 
should remain at 200 bpm or greater  (Table 3).

after implant to mitigate the risk of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia for those patients undergoing AV 
junction ablation. Following that the rate can be decreased to 60 ppm during routine clinical care. The 
pacemaker should be programmed in a VVIR mode with a lower rate of 60 bpm and an upper sensor rate set at 
80% of age -corrected maximum heart rate. The upper sensor rate should remain unchanged throughout the 
study. Device algorithms designed to promote fusion and increased  pacing during atrial fibrillation (e.g. 
ventricular sensed response, trigger pacing, ventricular rate regularization) should remain programmed ON 
throughout the study. Patients randomized  to either arm of the study are programmed in a similar fashion, as 
they are both in permanent AF. Should sinus rhythm spontaneously develop, or as a result of shock in response 
to VT, the device may need to be reprogrammed to a dual chamber mode.  
AV Junction Ablation Procedure: At the discretion of the investigator, ablat ion of the AVJ should be performed 
within 2 days  of implantation of a market -released CRT defibrillator (CRT -D) device  (unless active CRT -D device 
has been implanted ), although specific institutional or subject circumstances may necessitate a delay of up t o [ADDRESS_1134406] AV node. A deflectable ablation catheter is 
placed on the annulus where it records a large His -bundle electrogram. The catheter is then withdrawn until it 
records a large atrial electrogram and small His -bundle electrog ram. It is at this site that radiofrequency at 30 -
50W is delivered for up to 60 secs; if complete heart block does not ensue, the ablation catheter is repositioned 
and the process repeated. A prior study has demonstrated that the procedure can be successfu lly performed in 
>99% of patients. For rare subjects for whom there is difficulty, ablation can also be performed successfully at 
the left intraventricular septum using a retro -aortic approach. If conduction recovers, which is rare, the ablation 
will be re peated. There conceivably may be a very rare subject who fails both approaches, and these subjects 
will be followed in their assigned arm and treated with medical therapy for rate control, i.e. intent to treat.  The 
cardiac rhythm will be observed for at le ast [ADDRESS_1134407] ID based on the randomization strings pr ovided by 
[CONTACT_46134]. The randomization result is viewed by [CONTACT_819114]. All eligibility criteria will be confirmed prior to providing the randomization 
treatment assignment/subject ID to the en rolling site. 
 
5.2. Subject Consent   
Each potential subject will have the protocol described to them by [CONTACT_819115]. Potential subjec ts will sit down with the coordinator or physician and have 
the oppor tunity to ask questions. Those  who meet inclusion/exclusion criteria will then be asked to sign consent 
for study participation . At this time they will sign an “informed consent” form that is fully approved by [CONTACT_819116]. It is the responsibility of the investigator to ensure 
that subjects are eligible to participate in the  study prior to enrollment and throughout the study. Once 
informed consent has been obtained, all screening tests and procedures have been assessed and study eligibility 
has been confirmed, subjects will be randomized and assigned a unique subject identifi cation number.   The 
enrolling site will enter data in the web base system and the system will assign the subject ID after study 
eligibility criteria are met. The scheme for assign ing subject ID is as follow: first [ADDRESS_1134408] in the enrolling site.  
 
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_819094] s that informed consent from each potential research participant will be 
obtained by [CONTACT_819117].  The following person may obtain consent:  the 
principal investigator, sub-investigators , or study  team members listed on t he IRB application form as a consent 
designee. Each individual who will interact with potential research participants to obtain consent will submit 
evidence of human subjec t compliance training per local IRB regulations .  
 
5.3. Visit 1: Screening  
 Potential s ubjects will be screened to determine eligibility for participation in the study  per medical 
record review . Potential s ubjects will be identif ied based on planned CRT-D implant  or existing active 
CRT-D device .  Those who fulfill the study eligibility criteria and current indication for CRT -D 
implantation  or existing active CRT -D device  can be approached for inform consent , but additionally ECG 
evidence of AF will be required at consent  and meet study criteria prior to patient randomization . The 
screening visit might occur on the same day as the Baseline  and procedure  visit described below.   
 
5.4. Visit 2: Randomization and Baseline Assessment  
The following tasks  will be performed and documented at the Visit 2 (Visit [ADDRESS_1134409] on the same 
day as Visit 1 and Visit 3)  following informed consent : 
 Reconfirm inclusion and exclusion criteria  prior to randomization .  Presence of AF  in potential subjec ts 
who qualify for CRT -D implantation  or existing CRT -D device will be confirm ed as follow s: AF present at 
screening visit and at 2 additional time points, one within 3 months and one ≥ 3 months prior to 
enrollment, with no intervening ECGs revealing sinus rhythm and/or no successful effort to restore sinus 
rhythm for > 24 hours.  
 Subjects will undergo an echocardiogram at Baseline Visit prior to CRT -D implantation if no 
echocardiogram was performed within the past calen dar year prior to randomization to qualify patient 
for CRT -D implant per current medical guidelines.   For subjects  with an existing CRT -D device, an 
echocardiogram demonstrating <15% change in LVSEV in comparison to pre -implant cardiac imaging 
must be within three calendar months prior to consent.  
Page 11 of 21   Version 4.0                                                       September 26, 2018   Perform randomization to AVJ ablation or conventional treatment without  ablation if potential subject 
meets as study eligibility criteria  via the electronic data capture system or manually if internet access is 
not possible.  
 
Note:  Some of the following data will be required to confirm study eligibility criteria and recorded at time of 
screening confirmation and randomization.  If not required to confirm study eligibility, this data will be 
recorded after randomization occurs.   
 Perform clinical assessment and collect data on current prescribed CV medication s 
 Complete limited physical examination including vital signs, body weight, and height  
 Perform symptom assessment  
 Obtain a copy of standard 12 -lead ECG  used to confirm study eligibility  
 Obtain most recent echo cardiogram  images  obtained within 1 calendar year  prior to or on 
randomization date used to determine study eligibility and prior to CRT -D implant  
 Quality of Life assessment (prior to providing randomized treatment assignment to subject)  
 
5.5. Visit 3: Procedure  Day(s)    
CRT-D implantation  (unless subject has an existing, active CRT -D device ) and AVJ ablation (in subjects 
randomized to AVJ ablation arm) are  expected to be performed during this visit  which must occur within on 
or within [ADDRESS_1134410] is in electrophysiology lab for CRT -D implantation. However, the timing of the 
AVJ ablation is left to the discre tion of physician . It is recommend ed that AVJ ablation be performed within 2 
days of CRT -D implantation. Programing of CRT -D should  need to be adjusted at the time of AVJ ablation as 
described above.  
 
5.6. Visit 4: Follow -up at 1 calendar month after Randomization (1 calendar month   7 days)   
During this follow -up visit investigators/coordinators should:

insurance coverage  with the exception of the [ADDRESS_1134412]. These subjects will not undergo 
any additional study activities prior to withdrawal.  
 
6. ASSESSMENT OF STUDY ENDPOINTS  
 
6.1. Echocardiogram (ECHO)  
Echocardiographically  quantified left ventricular systolic volume is the primary endpoint of this study. Subjects 
will undergo an ECHO  at Baseline Visit prior to CRT -D implantation if no echocardiogram was performed within 
the past calendar year prior to randomization and at a 6-month  follow -up visit  after CRT-D implantation . The [ADDRESS_1134413]  follow  a 
standardized protocol; i mages  will be digitized and sent to central ECHO Core Lab for blind assessment  if 
possible . ECHO image acquisition that was performed to confirm eligibility  prior to study consent  will need to be 
sent to ECHO Core Lab at the Washington University in St. Louis  for approval regarding correct images and 
quality  after the subject signs the approved study consent . Sites will be supplied with training materials that will 
describe in detai l the methodology for obtaining JAVA -CRT echocardiograms. Training sessions will be conducted 
and documented for all participating sites.  
 
The ECHO will be sen t to [CONTACT_819134], Professor of Medicine/Cardiology at the Washington University in St. 
Louis  Medical Center.  [CONTACT_497575] is respected leader in the field with vast experience as clinician and 
echocardiography expert. He has served as Director of ECHO Core Lab for numerous clinical trials including 
recent ECHO -CRT trial.  He and his team will perform centralized b linded Echo reading. The ECHO will be used to 
also assess left ventricular diastolic volumes, left atrial volume , left ventricular function , and left ventricular 
dyssynchrony .  We will request that echo data will be de -identified when sent from enrolling s ite to the ECHO 
Core Lab but  just in case of identification still present the core lab will have “honest broker” who is a third party 
(an echo technician) who will receive the echos and de -identify them. The de -identified echos will then be 
analyzed by [CONTACT_819118].

Page [ADDRESS_1134414] of care  following CRT -D implant and/or AVJ ablation  and will 
be obtained to document rhythm and presence of atrial fibrillation as well as to assess and document CRT -D 
paced QRS morphology.  
 
6.3.  CRT-D Interrogation  
An i nterrogation of implanted CRT -D will be performed at each follow -up visit to document percentage of 
biventricular pacing and to document burden of appropriate and inappropriate ICD therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].   Assessment of 
CRT-D implant status and LV lead status will also be performed in addition to assessment of device 
programming.  
 
6.4. Clinical Assessment    
A clinical assessment will be performed  to include  functional status  (NYHA class) , interim hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], 
comorbidities, medications and heart failure event status .  Vital signs  and weight/height  will be collected at 
baselin e and at all study visits. Vital signs inclu de blood pressure, and heart rate .  
 
6.5.  Quality of Life Assessment  
Quality of life data will be acquired at baseline  prior to the subject being informed of the randomized treatment 
assignment  and at 6 -month follow -up visit using the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) 
administered to the subject .  
 
6.6.  Congestive Heart Failure  
Subjects will be categorized as having a “heart failure event” when the subject has symptoms and/or signs 
consistent with heart failure and:  
 
1. receives intravenous decongestive therapy (IV diuretics, IV neseritide, IV inotropes),  that does not involve 
formal in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063], regardless of the setting (i.e. in an emergency room setting, in the 
physician’s office, etc.), or  
2. receives an augmented heart failure regimen with oral or intravenous medications during an in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408] 
(formal hospi[INVESTIGATOR_819095] a calendar date change).  
 
Source documentation must be submitted to the CDC along with the completed CRF. Additional documentation 
will be requested from the enrolling center as needed. Initially, required documentation will only require a 
comprehensive discharge summary enabling t he endpoint reviewer to determine the heart failure classification. 
If the discharge summary is not sufficient to determine a classification or additional information is needed to 
complete the heart failure adjudication data requirements then documentation  will be requested from the 
enrolling center that may include some or all of the following, if available:  
• History and physical, or admit note, or ER note  
• Test results  
• Chest X -ray, lab work, echo, ultrasound, other test results as appropriate  
• Consults  
• Operative reports  
• Progress notes from the chart  
The collection of heart failure events will stop at the point the trial is terminated, enrollment has been stopped, 
and the subject has had their last clinic follow -up visit.  
 
7. SAFETY  AND REPORTAB LE EVENTS  
 
7.1. Adverse Event  Definition  
An adverse event  is any symptom, sign, illness, or experience that develops or worsens during the course of the 
study .  Any adverse event related to the A VJ ablation should be reported regardless of whether it met the 
definition of a serious adverse event as described in Section 7.2. All serious cardiovascular adverse event s 
Page 14 of 21   Version 4.0                                                       September 26, 2018  (including stroke)  must be reported  per definition in Section 7.2.  
 
7.2. Serious Adverse  Event  Definition  
A serious adverse event is defined as any adverse medical experience that results in any of the following 
outcomes:  
 death;  
 is life-threatening;  
 requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];  
 results in permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function ; 
 requires  medical or surgical intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage . 
 lead  to fetal distress, fetal death or a congenital abnormality or birth defect.  
 
7.3. Recording Adverse Events  Per Definition in Section 7.[ADDRESS_1134415] should be questioned directly regarding the occurrence of any adverse experience since his/her last 
visit.   
 
All adverse e vents , whether obs erved by [CONTACT_737], elicited from or volunteered by [CONTACT_423], should be 
documented  on or following randomization date  and within [ADDRESS_1134416] all adverse e vents per Section 7.1 definition  that occur during the study period in the 
appropriate source documents  and/or AE  case report form  with 10 calendar days of the date reported to the 
enrolling site .  The study period for reporting adverse events  (e.g., from the time of randomization to final study 
visit)  will be [ADDRESS_1134417], 
NIH, and FDA  per local regulations . Similar to other clinical trials conducted by [CONTACT_819119], adverse events will be immediately reported to the Co ordination and Data Center ( CDC) via 
dedicated web -based case report forms to the PI ([CONTACT_166452]) and Co -PI ([CONTACT_819135]). The CDC will be 
forwarding relevant documents to the Chair of DSMB for review and Chair will determine whether individual 
case will require immediate assessment by [CONTACT_819120]. The main poin t of assessment by [CONTACT_819121].  
 
8. RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT  
 
8.1. Potential Risks  
Early risk to patients:  The ablation catheter needs to be introduced through the femoral veins. This  can result in 
either bleeding (hematoma) or thrombosis. The former was reported in 1 of 252 subjects (0.4%) in one study; 
the latter was reported in 1 of 156 subjects (0.6%) in another study. When the ablation is performed after 
implantation of the CRT device, it is possible to dislodge one of the implanted leads with the ablation catheter; 
Page 15 of 21   Version 4.0                                                       September 26, 2018  this was observed in 2 of 156 subjects (1.2%) in a prior study. This complicatio n would require repositioning of 
the lead(s) that dislodged.  
Late complications : There are [ADDRESS_1134418] is that dislodgement 
of the ventricular lead in a pacemaker dependent subjec t could be fatal. However , a stable underlying escape 
rhythm is present in 67% of subjects following ablation. In addition, each subject in this trial will be undergoing 
biventricular pacing. It would be distinctly unusual for both the right and left ventricular leads to dislodge at the 
same time. Dislodgement of one ventricular lead would lead to loss of biventricular pacing but would still allow 
the other ventricular lead to pace the heart. In addition, contemporary left ventricular leads are multipolar, 
providing additional paci ng redundancy.  
The second feared complication is polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. In early tr ials of AV junction ablation, 
sudden cardiac death was observed in ~5% of patients. It was subsequently recognized that this was due to 
bradycardia -dependent p olymorphic tachycardia. This adverse event can be eliminated by [CONTACT_819122] a higher than usual lower rate cutoff (as has been 
designed in this trial). Arrhythmic mortality was observed in on ly 2 of 252 subjects (0.8%) when such a protocol 
was routinely employed in a post -AV junction trial of pacemaker patients. In our study, all subjects will have an 
implantable defibrillator; thus, in the extremely rare event that a subjec t develops post -ablation polymorphic 
ventricular tachycardia, the defibrillator would be able to resuscitate the subjec t.  
8.2. Protection Against Risks  
All subject s that are treated for AF and heart failure with CRT  are observed and treated in an optimal fashion as 
dictated by [CONTACT_819123]. 
If the subject experiences any adverse event during the study, they will be treated in a m anner consistent with 
clinical standards and the subject will be responsible for the costs of treatment.  
 
8.3. Potential Benefits to Subjects  
There is no guarantee of benefit from the AVJ ablation procedure. The study can provide better understanding 
of how to manage AF in the setting of HF in patients who will receive CRT. It is expected that the patient’s heart 
failure status including symptom s and function, quality of life, and need for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_819096].  
 
8.4. Alternatives to Participation  
Alternatives to participation are not to participate in the study and receive the same care outside of the formal 
study.  
9. DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING PLAN  
A data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) will be convened to independently monitor the conduct and the 
outcomes of the trial. The DSMB will be responsible for monitoring the safety and well -being of the subjects 
participating in this study  and ensuring the ethical conduct of the trial.  Since this study is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_819097] [ADDRESS_1134419], and data collection/analysis of the trial. The 
board will be comprised of 4 independent members: (1) a statistician with experience in clinical trials; (2) 2 
cardiologists with expertise  in HF clinical trials; and (3) [ADDRESS_1134420] ’s name 
[CONTACT_819133] .  Subjects ’ personal informa tion will be 
kept confidential and will not be released without his/her written permission, except as described in this section 
or as required by  [CONTACT_169291]. Subject ’s personal information may be shared, to the extent necessary, among the 
research staff, wi th the Institutional Review Board and for research oversight  as dictated by [CONTACT_427] .   
 
All information and data collected concerning subjects or their participation in this investigation will be 
considered confidential by [CONTACT_6750]. No social security numbers or direct identifiers will be collected by [CONTACT_6750]. 
Study data collected during this investigation may be used by [CONTACT_819124], 
publication, to support future research and/or other business pur poses. HIPAA authorization will be obtained 
from each subject by [CONTACT_819125].  
All data will be submitted using a password protected electronic data capture system with access limited to only 
those authorized by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_819098] . All study data will be coded with a study subject number that 
is assigned at the time of treatment randomization and cannot be linked to the patient’s identify except at the 
individual enrolling sites. Source document records to suppor t event adjudication or core laboratory analysis will 
be redacted of all PHI before being sent to the coordinating center and only the subject ID will be recorded to 
link the subject to this data.  The electronic data will be directly extracted from web sy stem for data collection.  
 
11. STATISTICAL METHODS AND POWER CONSIDERATIONS      
Overall Study Design and Primary Endpoint:  This study is designed as a 2 -arm unblinded randomized clinical 
trial. A total of 40 subjects receiving CRT -D will be randomized 1:1 to AVJ ablation or control arm (without AVJ 
ablation), stratified by [CONTACT_318976].  The primary endpoint is the binary response defined as ≥ 15% reduction in 
LVESV from baseline to 6 months. 
 
Randomization Scheme:   Enrolled subjects will be 1:1 randomized to AVJ ablation (with CRT -D) or control (CRT -D 
only) . The randomization sequence will consist of a string of random 4 - and 6 -blocks. That is, there will be a 50% 
chance that the first block will consist of 4 subjects (2 AVJ ablation + 2 control, in random order), and a 50% 
chance that it will contain 6 subjects (3 AVJ ablation + 3 control, in random order). Each subsequent block will 
similarly be of random size. This procedure makes it very difficult for anyon e to predict whether the next 
treatment assignment will be AVJ ablation (or control), helpi[INVESTIGATOR_819099]. In contrast, if 
each block were of size 4, then it would be trivial to perfectly predict every 4th treatment assignment as well as 
the 3rd, if the first two were both AVJ ablation or both control, which would be undesirable. Randomization will 
be stratified by [CONTACT_318976]. The randomization scheme will be generated by [CONTACT_819126] r Section 5 .  
 
Endpoint:  The primary endpoint is the binary response defined as ≥ 15% reduction in LVESV from baseline to 6 
months.   
Power and Sample Size:   Randomizing 20 subjects per arm (for a total of 40 subjects), and allowing for up to 
10% drop -out due to withdrawal, death, or inadequate imaging, we expect at least n= 18 evaluable subjects per 
arm. This sample size will provide 8 0% power to detect an absolute change of 50% in response rates, using a 
0.[ADDRESS_1134421], assuming the actual response rate in the AVJ ablation arm is 80 -85%, as in 
Page 17 of 21   Version 4.0                                                       September 26, 2018  Gasparini 2006 (1) and Ferreira 2008 (6), where the empi[INVESTIGATOR_819100] ∆ = 49% and 33%, 
respectively.  
Crossovers:  We anticipate  that virtually no subjects will cross over from the AVJ ablation arm to the control arm. 
We expect at most 2 -5% crossovers from control to the AVJ ablation arm, but we will work with investigators to 
consider these crossovers ideally only after trial comp letion so that they would have no effect on the primary 
endpoint. In any case, since the primary analyses will be conducted on an intention to treat (ITT) basis, 
crossovers will not affect the primary analysis. Furthermore, the stated response rates pertai n to the planned 
ITT analyses, so they and the associated power computations already implicitly account for the small expected 
effect of the limited crossovers we anticipate for this study.   
Statistical Methods:  The primary analysis will be an intention -to-treat (ITT) analysis based on Fisher’s exact test 
of the null hypothesis that the response rates are identical for both arms, conditional on the total number of 
responders.  Response rates for each arm will be estimated by [CONTACT_597818][INVESTIGATOR_819101] (maxi mum likelihood 
estimates), along with associated Clopper -Pearson exact 95% confidence intervals (CI).  Maximum likelihood 
estimates and associated 95% CI for the odds ratio (OR), relative risk (RR), and the absolute change in 
proportions will be used to su mmarize the treatment effect.  
Secondary Analyses:  Secondary endpoints include: a) change in LVEF from baseline to 6 months; b) LV end 
diastolic volume and change from baseline to 6 months; c) HF event including repeated HF event s; d) all -cause 
mortality; e ) VT/VF arrhythmic events requiring ICD therapy; f) inappropriate ICD therapy; g) percentage BiV 
pacing; h) quality of life; and i) complications related to AVJ ablation procedure. Since power for analyzing most 
secondary endpoints will be limited, seconda ry analyses will be mainly descriptive in nature.  However, to the 
extent feasible, statistical analysis will be performed, as described briefly below.  
Continuous secondary endpoints (a), (b), and (h) will be compared across arms using Wilcoxon and t -tests  and 
summarized via means, medians, and standard deviations.  Linear models will also be employed to adjust for 
potential effects of baseline values and demographic characteristics.  Power for some of these particular 
comparisons is expected to be relative ly high, given that mean changes on the order of 0.75 SD (0.50 -1.00 SD) 
can be detected with 88 -91% (55 -99%) power, using a 0.[ADDRESS_1134422]-event endpoints (c) and (d) will be modeled using Co x models, although power is 
expected to be very low for these secondary endpoints. Secondary endpoint (c) also includes repeated heart 
failure hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]. A cause -specific Anderson -Gill regression model (a generalization of the Cox model for a 
first event) treating death as a competing risk will be used to assess any difference in ongoing risk of repeated 
therapy in the two arms of the trial. Inference (p -values and confidence intervals) will be based on the robust 
grouped jackknife covariance estimat or to account for potential dependencies between times to repeated heart 
failure hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]. Secondary endpoint (f) concerns inappropriate ICD shocks. A cause -specific Cox model 
will be used to model time to first inappropriate shock, while repeated shock epi[INVESTIGATOR_819102] a 
cause -specific Anderson -Gill model, with inference based on the robust grouped jackknife covariance estimator. 
Each of these will treat death as a competing risk.  
Secondary endpoint (e) is about repeated appropriate ICD therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; for it, a robustified Anderson -Gill model 
will be carried out to assess any difference in ongoing risk of repeated therapy in the two arms of the trial.  
Safety endpoints of ablation (i) will include perforation/tamponade, cardiac arrest dur ing procedure, groin 
hematoma requiring evacuation, other vascular interventions, need for transfusion, failure to achieve heart 
block, and need for repeat ablation procedure. Counts and proportions will be used to summarize the 
distributions of these disc rete safety endpoints.  
12. ORGANIZATION OF THE STUDY   
Page [ADDRESS_1134423]. Wojciech Zareba and his team has developed a 
limited access electronic data capture (EDC) web -based management system for several past and ongoing 
studies  located on a production server hosted by [CONTACT_819127] . The system integrates subject 
enrollment from enrolling sites, randomization, follow -up, invoicing , and core lab and endpoint adjudication 
committees  with confidentiality as described in Section 10 .  Manual and/or automatic queries will be created in 
the EDC system and will be issued to the site for appropriate response. Enrolling site staff will be responsible for 
resolving all queries in the database, in a timely manner.  The enrolling site principal investigator (PI) provides 
his/her elect ronic signature [CONTACT_5760] (eCRFs) in compliance with local 
regulations . Changes to data previously submitted to the sponsor require a new electronic signature [CONTACT_3265] [CONTACT_978] 
[INVESTIGATOR_318948].  Database  backups are performed regularly.

13. HEART FAILURE EVENTS  ADJUDICATION COMMITT EE PROCESS  
 
A secondary endpoint in JAVA -CRT is occurrence of heart failure events. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_819106] a heart failure event in several prior drug and device trials, but not all subjects who require 
treatment f or severe heart failure are admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Symptoms and signs of heart failure such as 
fatigue, exertional dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, edema, rales, and pulmonary congestion 
are the cardinal findings of congestive heart fai lure. These signs and symptoms may be quite variable in 
presentation and severity, and the diagnosis of heart failure has both objective and subjective components. In 
addition, some of the symptoms and signs of heart failure can mimic or co -exist with unre lated conditions such 
as bronchitis, asthma, and pneumonia.  
 
The physician who makes a diagnosis of heart failure in a given subject utilizes information from the medical 
history, physical exam, and relevant laboratory data before initiating or augmenting decongestive therapy.  
 
Decongestive therapy can involve:  
1.  more rigorous dietary salt restriction, reduction in physical activity, or elevating the head with pi[INVESTIGATOR_819107];  
2.  initiation or augmentation of appropriate oral drugs such as di uretics, vasodilators, angiotensin converting 
enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, aldosterone receptor blockers, or cardiac glycosides;  
3.  initiation of intravenous medication including diuretics, neseritide (intravenous BNP), inotropes 
(pho sphodiesterase inhibitors, or adrenergic/dopaminergic agonists); and/or  
4.  ventilatory support.  
 
Many asymptomatic subjec ts with ejection fractions <0.[ADDRESS_1134424] 
of clinica l and laboratory findings before the therapy is started. Intravenous decongestive therapy is an excellent 
marker of a sev ere heart failure event.  
In JAVA -CRT, subjects will be categorized as having a “heart failure event” when the subject has symptoms 
and/or signs consistent with congestive heart failure and:  
1. receives intravenous decongestive therapy(IV diuretics, IV neseritide, IV inotropes) , that doe s not 
involve formal in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063], regardless of the setting (i.e. in an emergency room setting, 
in the physician’s office, etc.),  
Page 20 of 21   Version 4.0                                                       September 26, 2018  OR  
2. receives an augmented heart failure regimen with oral or intravenous medications during an in -hospit al 
stay (formal hospi[INVESTIGATOR_819095] a calendar date 
change).  
Heart Failure Event Endpoint Committee Adjudication Process  
 
Composition and Duties  
The JAVA -CRT Heart Failure Event Endpoint Committee will co nsist of, at a minimum, three non -participating 
cardiologists. One of the cardiologists specializes in heart failure, while the other two are an electrophysiologist 
and a non-invasive, general cardiologist . The committee will be responsible for the adjudic ation of the 
occurrence of heart failure events in the JAVA -CRT clinical trial and will meet quarterly at a minimum. The 
purpose of this process is to provide maximum uniformity and continuity in the review and categorization of 
heart failure events, while  still maintaining latitude for professional judgment by [CONTACT_819129].  
 
The Committee will receive information regarding all heart failure events from the enrolling sites. This 
information will be first sent to the Coordination and Data Center (CDC) where the supporting documentation 
will be reviewed for completeness and then forwarded to the committee. The committee then review s and 
adjudicate s the events within [ADDRESS_1134425] been established to review. They are events that occur in 1) 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]; and 2) ambulatory, out -of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_69225]. The Committee will review and adjudicate all heart 
failure events. The Committee will classify each event as a heart failure event , not a heart failure event, or 
needing additional information.   
 
Review of CHF Case Report Forms  
Each study data form will be systematically reviewed and validated by [CONTACT_819130]. For this 
purpose, JAVA -CRT data forms have been created. These forms are endpoint -specific. The committee members 
will initially review each study data form submitted in advance of the scheduled committee meeting and will 
independently document the results of their review on CHF Event Classification Forms developed by [CONTACT_12924].  
Reporting of Classification  
The Committee will complete a CHF Event Adjudica tion Data Form to the CDC that will be included in the JAVA -
CRT database with a confirmation report document forwarded to the DSMB by [CONTACT_319017]. A 
copy of each confirmation document will be archived by [CONTACT_819131].

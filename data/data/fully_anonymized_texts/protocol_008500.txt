AMENDMENT RATIONALE AND SUMMARY:  
The driver for this amendment was clarification of conflicting guidance on the dose and schedule of Stereotactic Radiosurgery (section 4.2) per organ.  Guidanc e now matches 
the corresponding dosing table for each organ. Specifically: 
• Section 4.2.1d (Brain) specified 3 and up to 5 fractions per day; now indicates 
that treatment to be delivered per institutional preference (i.e. on consecutive days versus several per week; one fraction per day) 
• Section 4.2.2  (Chest and Lung) specified in sections 4.2.2b and 4.2.2f  that 
patients could have 3-5 and 3- 10 treatments/fractions; the reference to 3 -5 has 
been removed  
• Section 4.2.3 (abdomen) was incomplete.  This has bee n removed as these lesions 
are rare  
• Section 4.2.4 (liver) section 4.2.4f; clarified that 3 to 5 treatments/fractions will be given on consecutive weekdays or every other day 
• Section 4.2.5 (spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]/soft tissue): deleted reference to dosing schedule in section 
4.2.5b as it conflicted with section 4.2.5f; revised dosing schedule in 4.2.5 to indicate dose to be delivered per institutional preference ((i.e. on consecutive days versus several per week; one fraction per day, 1 to 5 fractions) 
 In addition, the following minor clarifications were made:  
• Removed David Morris as Co-Investigator as he is no longer at UNC 
• Inclusion criteria Section 3.1.5; clarified that progressive disease is assessed via 
RECIST1.1  
• Section 4.3; clarified that 3 day washout means 3 full day s without erlotinib  
• Section 6.1 Time and events table: added footnotes to clarify tumor evaluations at progression and follow- up; added note that post SRS visit can occur on last day of 
SRS; clarified windows allowed around study visits 
• Section 6.9 (assessment of efficacy); refined definition of patients evaluable for analysis of efficacy

 This protocol has been amended to allow multicenter sites participat ing on this trial to 
utilize their institutional brand of radiosurgery machine. 
  
Throughout protocol, and particularly in section 4.2:  
Section 4.2:  We have edited the study to define standard of care (SOC) parameters for stereotactic radiosurgery that ar e not specific to the CyberKnife® brand.   
 
Rationale : The SOC radiosurgery incorporated in this multicenter protocol was referred 
to and specific for CyberKnife®.  However, the intent of this protocol is not to dictate which SOC radiosurgery is used, as t here are many brands of stereotactic radiosurgery.   
No core content has been modified.  The new parameters will not affect in any way how stereotactic radiosurgery is done for UNC patients—it remains SOC.  Similarly, it defines the SOC in such a way that parallel procedures will take part at our partner institutions so 
that their patients will also be treated per SOC.  
 
Minor typographical errors have been corrected throughout protocol  Added Co -Investigators as follows:   Julian Rosenman, MD ; Timothy Zagar , MD

1.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
1.1 Study Synopsis  
This is a single arm phase II trial of 40 patients evaluating a novel treatment 
strategy for patients with epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] (EGFR) -mutant non 
small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  Eligible patients  will have just progressed on a 
EGFR -tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI).  In the current trial, all sites of progressive 
disease will be treated with local ablation (primaril y stereotactic radiosurgery)  
followed by [CONTACT_602749]- TKI erlotinib until disease progression.  We hypothesize 
that this treatment strategy will lead to a progression free survival of at least 3 
months.  
1.2 EGFR -mutated NSCLC  
75% of NSCLC patients present with metastatic disease, with an expected median overall survival (OS) of [ADDRESS_798197] adenocarcinoma histology.  Presence of this mutation is inversely correlated with history of smoking.  It is present in 6% of patients with adenocarcinoma who are current smokers, 15% in former smokers, and 52% of never smokers
1.  Treatment of mutated disease with these EGFR -TKIs results in a 
median PFS (13 months) that exceeds the median OS for non -mutated patients2.  
Beyond the increased survival, toxicity on EGFR- TKIs i s very mild compared to 
cytotoxic chemotherapy, with an acnei form rash and diarrhea being the most  
common side effects  associated with their use . 
1.3 Erlotinib  
The only FDA approved EG FR-TKI in the [LOCATION_002] is erlotinib  (Tarceva®).  
This agent is approved for maintenance treatment of locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC that has not progressed after [ADDRESS_798198] line 
therapy of  metastatic  EGFR -mutant NSCLC.  PFS was 13.1 months after erlotinib  
therapy, as compared to  4.6 months after carboplatin plus gemcitabine (hazard 
ratio (HR)=0.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.10 to 0.26; p<0.0001) .   While these impressive results clearly represen t an advance in the treatment of 
NSCLC, all patients inevitably develop resistance and experience disease 
1 
LCCC1123  CONFIDENTIAL  
PI:[INVESTIGATOR_602723] 18, [ADDRESS_798199] the emergence of a mutant 
clone.  Whether through positive- selection of a resistant clone that was present 
before  starting therapy or from the evolution of such a clone during therapy, it is 
clear that some of the cancer cells will remain sensitive to erlotinib while others are resistant.  This molecular heterogeneity explains the frequently clinically observed mixed response at the time of progression in patients with EGFR mutation on erlotinib.  In this situation, many sites of disease remain well controlled with erlotinib while one or a small number of sites progress.  If such sites could be eliminated, systemic sensitivity to erlotinib could theoretically be restored.  Erlotinib could then be used for systemic control of remaining sites of disease.  
 Any modality of local control, such as surgery, radiation, or radiofrequency ablation could theoretically be used to eliminate resistant clones.  The following section explains the rationale for preferential use of radiation.  However, the anatomy of certain sites will be particularly amenable to alternative modalities of local control and the study will allow this.  
1.4.1 Radiation for patients with EGFR mutation  
EGFR mutant cells are 500 -1,000 fold more sensitive to radiation than wild- type 
cells, a phenomenon that extends to T790M mutant cells ( see Figure 1 ).
8,9  In 
EGFR wild -type cells exposed to radiation, EGFR rapi[INVESTIGATOR_602724]-PK, a key component of non-homologous end-joining repair.  In L858R or Δ E746-E750 cells, this mechanism of radioresistance 
is defective.  EGFR mutant cells do not halt DNA synthesis or progression to mitosis in response to radiation.

These in -vitro  findings are supported by [CONTACT_602750].  Investigators at the 
Dana Farber Cancer Institute reviewed their outcomes after thoracic radiation 
between EGFR mutant and wild-type tumors in a retrospective cohort of patients with locally advanced NSCLC
10.  The two- year locoregional relapse rate was 
45.5% in EGFR wild-type patients and 19.1% in patients with EGFR mutation.  These findings suggest that radiation may be a particularly effective modality for the treatment of EGFR mutant cancers (see Figure 2).

1.4.2 Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS)  
A number of studies have investigated stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for the 
treatment of cancer.  SRS is a method for delivering focused high dose 
3 
LCCC1123  CONFIDENTIAL  
PI:[INVESTIGATOR_602723] 18, 2014    
radiotherapy to a tumor while attempting to spare  surrounding normal tissues.  It 
is extremely effective at treating small lesions and with appropriate patient 
selection, has low toxicity.  It can be administered via several different modalities, 
including linear accelerator based (e.g. Varian’s Novalis, Accuray’s CyberKnife) which can treat both central nervous system and extracranial disease, as well as the GammaKnife which treats intracranial disease exclusively.  Much of the focus 
of research of SRS in lung cancer has been on cure of small lesions in patients who are not candidates for surgery.  However, multiple studies have investigated its use in metastatic disease.  
 Investigators at the University  of [COMPANY_002]ster Medical Center treated 49 patients 
with a total of 125 metastatic lesions and achieved a crude local control rate of 94%
11.  Of note, 8 of these patients had lung cancer; there was a tail to the 
survival curves for both breast cancer and lung cancer (see Figure 3) . 
 
 
 
                                                        Figure 3 
 
Another study evaluated only patients with metastatic NSCLC, with only 1 or 2 
sites of oligometastatic disease12.  The long term survival rate of 22% in this study 
was comparable to older studies utilizing primary surgical resection plus metastectomy of isolated adrenal or brain metastases from NSCLC  (see Figure 4) .

A larger series treated 121 patients with < 5 detectable metastases13.  As shown in

1.5 Correlative Studies  
VeriStrat ® is a commercially available serum proteomic test that identifies 
second  and third  line NSCLC patients who are likely to have a good or poor 
outcome ( as measured by [CONTACT_70112]) following erlotinib therapy.  Serum is analyzed 
5 
LCCC1123  CONFIDENTIAL  
PI:[INVESTIGATOR_602723] 18, 2014    
using Matrix Assisted Laser -Desportion Ionization Time of flight Mass 
Spectrometry (MALDI -TOF).  Eight peaks are analyzed to create a result of 
“good” or “poor.” 
 
 
 VeriStrat®  was initially developed on a training set of [ADDRESS_798200] outcomes in patients treated 
with an EGFR -TKI, it did not distinguish results from patients treated with 
chemotherapy.   
 The plot below shows the overall survival by [CONTACT_602751], patients treated in second- line with gefitinib.  
These data (on file at Biodesix), updated from those published originally
15, yield a 
hazard ratio between VeriStrat groups of 0.45 (95% confidence interval: 0.25-0.80), log-rank p=0.006. 
 
 Interestingly, sera were available from 29 patients who progressed on gefitinib in this series.  22 of these patients were VeriStrat®  good at the initiation of the 
study and 11 (50%) of these converted to VeriStrat®  poor at the time of withdrawa l from study therapy
16. 
 Similar results were found in an analysis of ECOG 3503, a single- arm phase II 
study of erlotinib for first line therapy of NSCLC
17.  Of 137 enrolled patients, 
analyzable samples were availabl e on 102.  VeriStrat® identified 73% of these as 
6 
LCCC1123  CONFIDENTIAL  
PI:[INVESTIGATOR_602723] 18, 2014    
having a good signature [INVESTIGATOR_1238] 27% as having a poor signature.  As shown below, 
both OS and PFS w ere different for patients with good and poor signatures. 
 
  
 
 
A retrospective analysis of the [ADDRESS_798201] significantly better outcomes than those classified as  
VeriStrat Poor. Multivariate analysi s showed that VeriStrat remains  a significant 
predictor of OS when adjusted for other patient characteristics, including EGFR mutation status. In addition to showing in the placebo arm that VeriStrat has a 
clear prognos tic component, this study demonstrat ed that VeriStrat was predictive 
of response to erlotinib, with all but one of the 19 responders being classified as VeriStrat Good
18.  
 
A study has been undertaken to investigate changes in patient VeriStrat classification during the course of gefitinib therapy.
16  It was found that, although 
VeriStrat classifications remained generally stable during the course of treatment, in approximately 30% of the patients  classified as VeriStrat Good at baseline, the 
classification changed to VeriStrat Poor near progression. Progression in these patients was found to be associated with the development of new lesions. Changes of VeriStrat classification from VeriStrat Poor to VeriStrat Good during the 
course of treatment were observed, but were rare.

 Serum will be collected for testing with the VeriStrat® MALDI -TOF assay.  
Several  exploratory objectives will be evaluate d.  We will evaluate if VeriStrat®

evaluate if VeriStrat®  following completion of SRS predicts for longer PFS or 
OS with re -initiation of erlotinib.  We will evaluate whether “poor” VeriStrat® 
signatures ever turn to “good” signatures following SRS.  We will evaluate PFS 
and OS of patients whose signature [CONTACT_602768] “poor” to “good.”  . We will explore response rates and PFS on subsequent treatments (see section 6.5).

4.2.1b Treatment technique 
An immobilization/patient localization system is  mandatory for this study. 
Multiple isocenter and non- isocentric techniques are permitted.  
4.2.1c Treatment volumes The goal of treatment planning is to deliver a conformal dose of radiation to the 
contrast enhancing target volume based on MR or CT images.  Treatment volumes 
will be determined based on correlation of diagnostic imaging with a treatment planning CT scan performed at 1.[ADDRESS_798210] and/or neurosurgeon. Both radiation oncologist and neurosurgeon need to review the target volumes. When a patient is able to undergo a MRI, MRI will be used with formal image registration. The preferred image is a T1 image post-gadolinium at a minimum of [ADDRESS_798211]-surgically, the tumor bed (resection cavity) as defined on the T1 gadolinium enhanced image will be treated. This can be termed GTV or 
CTV.  No PTV will be defined unless there is evidenced of registration error. The use of a PTV will be at the discretion of the treating physicians but should not be greater than a 3 mm 3D expansion.  
4.2.1d Treatment schedule / time and dose considerat ions 
  Radiosurgery treatments will be deliv ered per institutional preference (on 
consecutive weekdays versus several per week; one fraction per day).  
 
  Time and dose considerations: 
 
• Prescription isodose : The dose will be calculated to the 50 -100% isodos e 
curve as normalized to the maximum dose. Dose is specified in Gray (Gy) to muscle . 
• Coverage : The target lesion should be covered at least 95% by [CONTACT_602754]; small volume lesions (those treated with a single [ADDRESS_798212] a high conformity (>1.8) index) may be 
covered with less than a 95% but not less than 90% 
• Conformity of dose : Conformity indices PIV*TIV/TV²  should be within 
1.00 – 1.80; small volume lesions (those treated with a single [ADDRESS_798213] a high conformity (>1.8) index) may be treated with a conformity index < 2.0 
• Total dose : The total dose is to the prescription isodose

LCCC1123  CONFIDENTIAL  
PI:[INVESTIGATOR_602723] 18, 2014    
• Normal tissue dose limitations : The dose to the optic chiasm and nerves 
will be < 8 Gy if a single fraction, < 15 Gy in 3 fractions, < 25 Gy in 5 
fractions; if there has been prior radiation acceptable tolerance limits are < 6 Gy single fraction, < 12 Gy in 3 fractions, < 20 Gy in 5 fractions. Brainstem will be < 15 Gy per fraction or total cumulative  dose of < 20 
Gy unless tumor is i ntrinsic to the brainstem. Volume of brain receiving 
>12Gy should be limited to <10cc in a single fraction treatment. Volume of brain for fractionated treatment will not have a limit 
• Dose schedule : Patients will receive one treatment daily, delivered per  
institutional preference (on consecutive days versus several per week; one fraction per day) 
 
 
  
   
 
 
  
 
 
 
      
RTOG SRS QA Guidelin es will be followed and AAPM Report 54 Guidelines

  Please note: based on anatomic location, edema/mass effect, and patient’s 
extracranial disease status doses can be reduced by 10% or converted to 
fractionated treatment. Normal tissue tolerance limits that are specified should be respected unless there are special circumstances.  
 
Anatomic locations where dose reduction or fractionation can be considered are posterior fossa, deep and central (thalamic, insular, brainstem) or motor strip (or adjacent to motor strip). Dose reductions are allowed but not required. This will require clinical judgment. 
 Although we rarely treat more than 4  intracranial  lesions, when doing so dose is 
16 Gy to the lesions.

4.2.2c Treatment volumes  
The goal of treatment planning is to deliver a conformal dose of radiation to the 
contrast enhancing target volume based CT images. Treatment volumes will be determined  based on correlation of diagnostic imaging with a treatment planning 
CT scan performed at 1.[ADDRESS_798214] 
and/or thoracic surgeon. The preferred image for target contouring is a CT image post- contrast at a minimum of 1.5 mm between image slices with the image 
obtained at the normal end expi[INVESTIGATOR_50126]. When a patient is unable to maintain a breath  hold for the entire scan (which is an expected common occurrence) the 
breath  hold at end expi[INVESTIGATOR_602726]. If a breath hold technique cannot be performed a 4D-CT scan should be obtained.  Note: FOV on the “big bore” CT should be limited to [ADDRESS_798215] dose algorithm.

contrasted study. 
4.2.2e Treatment immobilization  
Patients will be positioned in a stable position capable of allowing accurate reproducibility of the target posi tion from treatment to treatment. Positions 
uncomfortable for the patient should be avoided so as to prevent uncontrolled movement during treatments. A variety of immobilization systems may be used, including stereotactic frames that surround the patient on three sides and large rigid pi[INVESTIGATOR_50151] (conforming to patients’ external contours) with reference to the stereotactic coordinate system . Patient immobilization must be reliable enough to insure that the gross tumor volume (GTV) does not deviate beyond the confines 
of the planning treatment volume (PTV) with any significant probability (i.e., < 5%).  
4.2.2f Treatment schedule / time and dose considerations  
Time and dose considerations:  
• Prescription isodose : The dose will be calculated to the 60 -100% isodose 
curve as normalized to the maximum dose. In general, the 60-85% isodose 
curve is strived for target coverage  
•    Coverage : The target lesion should be covered at least 95% by [CONTACT_602756] 99% should be covered by 90% of the prescriptio n isodose curve 
• Conformity of dose : Conformity indices PIV*TIV/TV² should be within 
1.00 – 1.80 at 2 cm from the PTV, the dose should be no greater than 30 Gy. The ratio of 50% isodose volume to the prescription Isodose volume 
should be no greater than 3.9

The goal of treatment planning is to deliver a conformal dose of radiation to the contrast enhancing target volume based on MR or CT images. Treatment volumes will be determined based on correlation of diagnostic imaging with a treatment planning CT scan performed at 1.00 to 1.50 mm slice thickness. Minimal margins of up to 3 mm beyond the GTV will be used for microscopic tumor spread (CTV) respecting normal anatomic boundaries. The preferred margin is 3 -5 mm in all 
dimensions.  PTV should include an additional margin of 1.5-5 mm depending on location of the fiducial markers, image registra tion quality, tumor deformation, 
and the patient’s respi[INVESTIGATOR_3323].  The relevant target volumes and critical structures for treatment planning will be contoured by [CONTACT_602758]/or surgeon. Both radiation oncologist and surgeon need to review the target volumes.

4.2.5e Treatment immobilization 
Patients must be positioned in a stable supi[INVESTIGATOR_602730], allowing the patient to feel as comfortable as possible. Positions uncomfortable for the patient should be avoided to prevent unnecessary movement. A prone position is not allowed. A variety of immobilization systems  may be utilized including vacuum

 Time and dose considerations:  
• Prescription isodose : The dose will be calculated to the 60 -100% isodose

• Conformity of dose : Conformity indices PIV*TIV/TV²  should be within 
1.00 – 2.00 
• Total dose : The total dose to the prescription isodose 
• Normal tissue dose  limitations : 
o For single fraction treatment:  The maximum voxel dose to the 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_62402] 15 Gy in a single fraction. 10% of the volume (as defined as 6mm above and below the PTV) should be less than 10 G y in a single fraction . No voxel to the kidney 
greater than 15Gy with a limit of 6 Gy to 50% of the kidney 
o For patients who have received prior radiation or are receiving treatment to multiple levels, treatment typi[INVESTIGATOR_602732] : The maximum v oxel dose to the spi[INVESTIGATOR_602733] 5 Gy in a single fraction and 10% of the volume should 
not exceed [ADDRESS_798227] should not exceed 15 Gy to 10% of the volume if fractionated treatm ent is utilized . Attempts to limit dose  to the

 NB: In all circumstances, normal tissue tolerances need to be respected and dose reductions will be ac       
4.3 Erlotinib Treatment Dosage and Administration 
Erlotinib (Tarceva®) will be administered per standard of care.  Of note, patients 
with EGFR mutation often require substantially less than the standard dose to 
achieve efficacy.  Thus, while the study recommends a standard starting dose, patients with known intolerance at this dose, but known tolerance with efficacy at a lower dose will be allowed to initiate at that dose.  Erlotinib will be taken once 
per day on an empty stomach (one hour before, or two hours after food).  At the time of enrollment into the study, patients may already be on erlotinib therapy.  For these patients , it is recommended (but not required) that erlotinib be 
discontinued 3 days prior to the initiation of SRS  (i.e., if last dose of erlotinib is 
on a Sunday, SRS can be administered on Thursday).  The study recommends that erlotinib be restarted 3 days after the completion of SRS.  At the investigator’s discretion, erlotinib may be started sooner (or never discontinued) but not later. .   
4.4 Toxicities and Dosing Delays/Dose Modifications 
Erlotinib is FDA approved for the population being studied and treating clinicians 
have extensive experience in toxicity management, dosing delays, and dose modifications.  As erlotinib is the only FDA approved TKI targeted against EGFR  
in the [LOCATION_002]  and no international sites are planned, it is anticipated that 
most or all patients will have received erlotinib specifically prior to study entry.  The study therefore does not demand a specific strategy for toxicity management.  Rather, the study refers  clinicians to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_602734]. 
4.5 Concomitant Medications/Treatments  
Erlotinib does not commonly causes significant interactions with concomitant medications.  In theory, CYP3A4 inhibitors may increase erlotinib plasma Status of

In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse events, treatment may continue 
until:  
• Disease progression  
• Inter -current illness that prevents further administration of treatment  
• Unacceptable adverse event(s)  
• Patient decides to withdraw from the study, OR  
• General or specific changes in the patient’s condition render the 
patient unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the

Patients will be followed until death.   See section 6.5 for details. 
5.0 DRUG INFORMATION  
5.1 Erlotinib ( Tarceva ®) 
5.1.1 Mechanism of Action  
The mechanism of clinical antitumor action of erlotinib is not fully characterized.  
Erlotinib inhibits the intracellular phosphorylation of tyrosine kinase associated with the epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] (EGFR). Specificity of inhibition with regard to other tyrosine kinase receptors has not been fully characterized. EGFR is expressed on the cell surface of normal cells and cancer cells.  
5.1.2 How supplied  
Erlotinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose 
disease has not progressed after four cycles of platinum- based first -line 
chemotherapy, and for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic non- small 
cell lung cancer after failure of at least one prior chemotherapy regimen. For the present study, it will be supplied by [CONTACT_602760].    
5.1.[ADDRESS_798229] demonstrated that patients w ith this mutation can achieve efficacy 
with substantially lower dosages with subsequent better tolerance of therapy. Thus, while the recommended dose will remain the FDA approved dose of

PI:[INVESTIGATOR_602723] 18, [ADDRESS_798249] SRS/local ablative therapy The toxicity of erlotinib has been well defined in multiple phase III studies.  
However, two elements are different in this study.  First, erlotinib is being used after SRS.  While this has been done before in clinical practice, the toxicity has not been systematically assessed.  Second, if the therapy is efficacious, patients may spend a longer time on erlotinib and live a longer time, potentially exposing longer-term toxicities that have been masked by [CONTACT_602763]. 
6.9.6 Veristrat ® in EGFR mutated NSCLC  
Veristrat ® has been shown to be prognostic in untreated patients as well as 
predictive of both response and survival in EGFR- TKI treated pat ients, including 
patients with EGFR mutation.  Although change in V eristrat ® result from “good” 
to “poor” has been demonstrated in patients progressing on an EGFR- TKI, the 
assay has never been evaluated in the context of a therapy seeking to restore systemic sensitivity to a TKI and a “poor” to “good” transition has never been documented.  Exploratory analyses of both the good vs. poor signature [CONTACT_602769].

• >10mm by [CONTACT_3610] (CT scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm)  
• 10mm caliper measurement by [CONTACT_40133] (lesions which cannot be 
accurately measured with calipers should be recorded as non -
measurable).  
• [ADDRESS_798252] be ≥15mm in short axis when assessed by [CONTACT_3610] (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5mm).  At baseline and in follow-up, only the short axis will be measured and followed.    All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter <10mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 to <15 mm short axis) as well as truly non-measurable lesions, will be considered non-measurable.  Lesions considered truly non-measurable include:  leptomeningeal disease; ascites; pleural/pericardial 
effusion; inflammatory breast disease ; lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, 
abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by [CONTACT_87415].  All measurements should be recorded in metric notation, using calipers if clinically  assessed. All baseline evaluations should be performed as close as 
possible to the treatment start and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.  The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each  identified and reported lesion at baseline and during 
follow-up.  Imaging based evaluation should always be done rather than clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461].  Clinical lesions w ill only be considered measurable 
when they are superficial and ≥10 mm diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g. skin nodules). For the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_602764] a ruler to estimate the size of the lesions is recommended. 
6.9.9 Baseline Documentation of Target and Non- Target Lesions  
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 5 lesions total (and a maximum of two lesions per organ) representative of all involved organs should be identified as target lesions and will be recor ded and measured at baseline.   
 Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longer diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  
 A sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters. If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, only the short axis is 
32 
LCCC1123  CONFIDENTIAL  
PI:[INVESTIGATOR_602723] 18, 2014    
added into the sum.  The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to 
further characterize the objective tumor response of the measurable dimension of the disease.  
 All other lesions (or sites of disease) including pathological lymph nodes should be identified as non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements are not required and these lesions should be followed as “present” or “absent”, or in rare cases “unequivocal progression”.   
6.9.[ADDRESS_798253] 1.1 Cr iteria  
Complete response (CR)− Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological 
lymph node (LN) (whether target or non- target)  must have decreased in short 
axis to <10mm.  
 
Partial response (PR) −At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the LD of the target 
lesions taking as reference the baseline sum LD.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD )−At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of the 
target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started including baseline if that is the smalles t on study.  In addition to 
the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5mm.  The appearance of one or more new lesions also constitutes PD.

when subsequent scans suggest small lesions were likely still present and in fact the patient had PR, not CR at the first time point.  Under these circumstances, the original CR should be changed to PR and the best response is PR.

7.0 ADVERSE EVENTS  
7.1 Definition s  
7.1.1 Adverse Event (AE)  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence (e.g., an abnormal 
laboratory finding, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a 
drug) in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not related to the medicinal product.   
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_129297] (e.g., surgical insertion of central line) need not be considered AEs and should not be recorded as an AE.  Disease progression should not be recorded as an AE, unless it is attributable by [CONTACT_353202]. 
34 
LCCC1123  CONFIDENTIAL  
PI:[INVESTIGATOR_602723] 18, 2014    
7.1.2 Suspected Adverse Reaction (SAR)  
A suspected  adverse reaction (SAR) is any AE for which there is a reasonable 
possibility  that the drug is the cause.   Reasonable possibility  means that there is 
evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE.  A 
suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug.   
 
Causality assessment to a study drug is a  medical judgment made in consideration 
of the following factors: temporal relationship of the AE to study drug exposure, known mechanism of action or side effect profile of study treatment, other recent or concomitant drug exposures, normal clinical course of the disease under investigation, and any other underlying or concurrent medical conditions.  Other factors to consider in considering drug as the cause of the AE: 
• Single occurrence of an uncommon event known to be strongly associated 
with drug exposure (e.g., angioedema, hepatic injury, Stevens-Johnson 
Syndrome) 
• One or more occurrences of an  event not commonly associated with drug 
exposure, but otherwise uncommon in the population (e.g., tendon rupture); often more than once occurrence from one or multiple studies would be needed before the sponsor could determine that there is reasonable pos sibility  that the drug caused the event.   
• An aggregate analysis of specific events observed in a clinical trial that 
indicates the events occur more frequently in the drug treatment group 
than in a concurrent or historical control group 
7.1.[ADDRESS_798259] information (e.g., Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for an unapproved investigational product or package insert/summary of 
product characteristics for an approved product).  Unexpected also refers to AEs 
or SARs that are mentioned in the IB as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring w ith the particular drug under investigation.   
7.1.4 Serious AE or SAR  
An AE or SAR is considered serious if, in the view of either the investigator or 
sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death;  
• Is life -threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death from 
the event as it occurred);  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (>24 hours) or prolongation of 
existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059];*  
• Results in  congenital anomaly/birth defect;  
• Results in a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions; 
35 
LCCC1123  CONFIDENTIAL  
PI:[INVESTIGATOR_602723] 18, 2014    
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -
threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious 
adverse drug experience when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition.  For reporting purposes, also consider the occurrences of pregnancy as an event which must be reported as an important medical event.  
 *Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_353184], central line insertion, metastasis interventional therapy, resection of primary tumor, or elective surgery, will not be considered serious adverse events.  
7.[ADDRESS_798260] begin from day 1 of study treatment and continue until the AE or SAR is resolved or returns to <grade 1 or baseline.  
 
Collected information should be recorded in the Electronic Case Report Forms 
(eCRF) for that patient.  Please include a description of the event, its severity or toxicity grade, onset and resolved dates (if applicable), and the relationship to the 
study drug.    Documentation should occur at least monthly.

After informed consent but prior to initiation of study medications, only SAEs caused by a protocol -mandated intervention will be collected (e.g. SAEs related to 
invasive procedures such as biopsies, medication washout, or no treatment run-in).   For any other experience or condition that meets the definition of an SAE or a 
serious SAR, recording of the event must begin from day 1 of study treatment and continue through the 30 day follow-up period after treatment is discontinued.   For a ny other experience or condition that meets the definition of a serious 
adverse event (SAE) or SAR , recording of the event must begin from day 1 of 
study treatment and continue through the 30 day follow-up pe riod after treatment 
is discontinued.   
7.3.2 Documentation and Notification 
These events (SAEs or serious SARs) must be recorded in the eCRF for that 
patient within [ADDRESS_798261] Manager indicating that an SAE or Serious 
36 
LCCC1123  CONFIDENTIAL  
PI:[INVESTIGATOR_602723] 18, 2014    
SAR has been entered into Oncore (email contact [CONTACT_353204]-
up).  
7.3.3 Reporting  
FDA Expedited Reporting requirements  for studies conducted under an IND : 
If an investigator deems that an event is both a serious SAR AND unexpected, it 
must also (in addition to Oncore) be recorded  on the MedWatch Form 3500A as per 
[ADDRESS_798262] Manager at [PHONE_7309] along with supporting 
documentation defining the event and causality.  The MedWatch 3500a form can be accessed at : 
http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/HowToReport/DownloadForms/default.htm
. 
(Please be sure and access form 3500a, and not form 3500). UNC, as the Sponsor of the study, will make the final determination regarding FDA submission.   
 
UNC study personnel are responsible for informing the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_602740] , and, if it is also a serious SAR AND unexpected, for forwarding all 
MedWatch 3500A forms to the FDA in accordance with 21 CFR 312.32 (for drugs under an IND) and 21 CFR 314.80 (for marketed drugs).     The UNCCN Project Manager will a lso be responsible for informing each Affiliate 
site of all serious and unexpected SARs via fax as soon as possible.    
IRB Reporting Requirements:  
Affiliate sites:   
• For affiliate sites using a local IRB of record, please submit adverse events 
per local I RB policy. 
• For affiliate sites relying on the UNC -IRB, an aggregated list of all SAEs 
will be submitted to the UNC IRB annually at the time of study renewal 
according to the UNC IRB policies and procedures.   In addition, any 
SAEs that qualify as an Unantic ipated Problem will be entered into 
Oncore and reported to the UNC IRB by [CONTACT_602765]’s web- based reporting system (see section 9.5.3) within 7 
days of the Investigator becoming aware of the problem.    
 
UNC : 
• UNC will submit an aggregated list of all SAEs to the UNC IRB annually 
at the time of study renewal according to the UNC IRB policies and 
procedures. 
• The UNC -IRB will be notified of all SAEs that qualify as an 
Unanticipated Problem as per the UNC IRB Policies using the IRB’s web -
based reporting system  (see sectio n 9.5.3) within 7 days of the Investigator 
becoming aware of the problem.

7.4 Data and Safety Monitoring Plan 
The Principal  Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_602741] 
(DSM C).  
 
Meetings/teleconferences  will be held at a frequency dependent on study accrual, 
and in consultation with the study Biostatistician.  Th ese meetings will include  the 
investigators  as well as protocol nurses , clinical research associates , regulatory 
associat es, data manager s, biostatistician s, and any other relevant personnel the 
principal investigators may deem appropriate.  At these meetings, the research 
team will discuss  all issues relevant to study progress, including enrollment, 
safety, regulatory, data collection, etc.  
 The team will produce summaries or minutes of these meetings. These summaries will be available for inspection when requested by [CONTACT_87227], but not limited to, the oversight of the Office of Human Research Ethics (OHRE) Biomedical  IRB, the Oncology Protocol Review Committee (PRC) or the North 
Carolina TraCS Institute  Data Safety Monitoring Board  (DSMB) .   
 
The UNC LCCC Data and Safety and Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will 
review the study on a regular (quarterly to annually) basis, with the frequency of review based on risk and complexity as determined by [CONTACT_87228] .  The UNC PI [INVESTIGATOR_353187]: 1) safety and accrual data including the number of 
patients treated; 2) significant developments reported in the literature that may affect the safety of participants or the ethics of the study; 3) preliminary response 
data; and 4) summaries of team meetings that have occurred since the last report.  
Findings of the DSMC review will be disseminated by [CONTACT_87229], 
PRC, and the UNC IRB and DSMB.   
8.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
8.1 Study Design/Study Endpoints  
This is a single arm phase II trial of [ADDRESS_798263] progressed on an 
EGFR -TKI.  The primary endpoint of the study will be progression free survival.  
Secondary endpoints include overall survival, local control rate of sites ablated by [CONTACT_218117], toxicity of SRS, toxicity of erlotinib after SRS, and proteomics based biocorrelates ( Veristrat® ). 
8.[ADDRESS_798264] -line erlotinib.  However, the FDA has approved 
docetaxel, pemetrexed and erlotinib for second line therapy based on a median

While a PFS that matched the best previously demonstrated second line resul ts 
would be sufficient to meet the threshold for further study, several factors are 
worthy of note in considering how such results could be interpreted and utilized.  
First, both SRS and erlotinib are substantially less toxic than cytotoxic 
chemotherapy.  Second, this therapy would represent an additional option for 
EGFR mutant patients —after second progression on erlotinib, patients would still 
be eligible for treatment with standard chemotherapy.  Thus, we hypothesize that the proposed treatment strategy will lead to a median progression free survival of at least 3 months.  
 A median PFS of 3 months implies that at 3 months, 50% of the population will still be progression free (PF).  With 40 patients, the following table shows the precision of the 95% confidence interval that will be constructed for the percentage of patients who are PF at 3 months.  If the percentage of patients PF at 3 months is 65% the 95% CI will be (48%- 79%).

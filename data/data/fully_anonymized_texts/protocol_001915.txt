Version Date 08/05/[ZIP_CODE].0 INTRODUCTION
1.1 Biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer
Around 161,360 men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in the [LOCATION_002] in 
2017 and an estimated  26,730  will die of the disease1. About 20 to 40% of patients  undergoing  
radical prostatectomy (RP)2 and 30 to 50% of patients  undergoing radiation therapy (RT) at 
some time point  will experience rising prostate  specific antigen (PSA) following definitive  
therapy in the absence of visible  metastases on imaging3, a condition known as biochemical 
recurrence (BCR)4. The definition of BCR is dependent upon the type of local therapy. 
Biochemical recurrence after RP is defined  by [CONTACT_610139] 0.2 ng/mL  measured [ADDRESS_809033] showing a persistent PSA > 0.2 ng/mL  5. 
Biochemical recurrence  after RT is defined as a PSA rise of 2 ng/mL or more above the 
nadir, regardless of whether or not a patient receives  androgen deprivation therapy (Phoenix 
definition)6. The Phoenix definition has shown improved accuracy over the ASTRO 
(American Society for Radiation Oncology) definition  of biochemical failure (defined as 
three consecutive PSA rises following a nadir)  in predicting clinical failures and has been  
widely used in clinical practice7.
In this asymptomatic phase  of the disease,  the most effective management is still 
unknown since no intervention has been  shown to prolong survival. Acceptable treatment 
options include: 1) salvage radiation  therapy for BCR after prostatectomy; 2) salvage 
prostatectomy in selected cases after RT; 3) observation with close surveillance; 4) 
intermittent or continuous androgen deprivation  therapy (ADT); or 5) enrollment in clinical 
trials.
Several retrospective studies demonstrated that early ADT has no significant effect on 
overall survival (OS)  since it decreases prostate  cancer-specific mortality (PCSM)  but 
increases non-prostate cancer specific mortality8-10. Retrospective study by [CONTACT_262276]-Albeniz 
and colleagues presented at 2014 Annual ASCO Meeting used the CaPSURE registry to 
evaluate data from  2,012 patients with PSA-only relapse  after radical prostatectomy  or 
radiation therapy. Patients who underwent immediate ADT demonstrated no significant 
advantage in all-cause mortality (HR=0.94)  or prostate cancer-specific mortality (HR=1.15). 
Estimated 5-year  OS rates  of 85.1% in the immediate ADT arm and 87.2% in the deferred  
ADT arm, and estimated 10-year OS was 71.6% in both arms, indicating that there may be 
no need for immediate ADT treatment in BCR patients11.
Patients with BCR have a variable clinical course: some will have  indolent course 
with no impact their OS; others may have a rapid progression to radiographically  apparent 
metastasis with increased risk for dying from prostate cancer. Comparison of outcomes  
demonstrated that patients with BCR have  a 88% 10-year  OS rate in contrast to the 93% 10- 
year OS rate in men without BCR12. In a landmark study evaluating BCR following RP, the 
median time from  BCR to clinical progression was noted to be 8 years and from metastasis to 
PCSM was 5 years13, indicating that median OS from  the diagnosis of BCR was around 13 
years.

Version Date 08/05/2019PSA doubling time (PSADT) after the prostate  cancer treatment can also be used to 
provide some insight into prognosis. A study of 432 T1-3N0M0 prostate cancer patients who 
developed BCR following definitive three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) or 
intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) from  1989 to 2005 demonstrated that PSADT
remains a significant predictor of clinical failure and prostate  cancer specific survival. 
Immediate use of ADT in patients with PSADT of <6 months was significantly associated with 
improved prostate cancer specific survival, although the survival benefit  was less apparent in 
patients with longer PSADT14.
Choueiri and colleagues reported a retrospective analysis of 3,071 men who 
underwent radical  prostatectomy  at Duke University (between 1988 and 2008). After a 
median follow-up  of 7.4 years  from the time of RP, 17.8 % men had had a BCR and 14.8 % 
had died of all causes. The median follow-up after PSA failure was 11.2 years. In men who 
experienced BCR, a PSA doubling  time <6 months was associated with a significantly 
increased risk of overall death from any cause (HR = 1.55)15.
D'Amico and colleagues have  suggested that men who have a BCR with a PSADT > 
15 months after RP are at minimal risk for prostate cancer metastasis or prostate cancer 
specific mortality, whereas those with a PSADT of 3 months or less are at very high risk. 
Another study of 8,669 patients with prostate  cancer treated with RT (5,918 pts) or RP (2,751 
pts) found that a PSADT < 3 months was also significantly associated with prostate cancer 
specific mortality16.
A retrospective study of patients with BCR who were enrolled in four clinical trials at 
Johns Hopkins University of the non-hormonal  agents: marimastat (a  matrix metalloproteinase 
inhibitor), imatinib, ATN-224 (a copper/zinc-superoxide dismutase  inhibitor) and 
lenalidomide demonstrated  that changes in PSADT were prognostic for metastasis-free 
survival, which may suggest that the onset of metastasis may be delayed if an experimental 
agent is capable of significantly prolonging the PSADT17.
In summary, the value of ADT is not clear in BCR population  and no study has 
shown that therapeutic intervention in this setting may improve overall survival. Further 
research is needed to determine the optimal initiation point of ADT, and whether alternative 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_610112].
1.2 Androgen receptor role in prostate cancer
Several studies demonstrated that the androgen receptor (AR) plays a crucial role in 
pathogenesis of prostate cancer18 and its progression in castration resistant disease19. AR is a 
member of the steroid receptor  super family and controls expression of several genes  involved 
in cell survival, differentiation, proliferation, and metabolism20. AR activation and 
overexpression are consistent findings in castration resistant  clones, demonstrating the pi[INVESTIGATOR_610113]21. The regulation  of AR activation can be initiated by [CONTACT_177735]-
dependent and ligand-independent mechanisms 22.

Version Date 08/05/2019Ligand-dependent activation is the predominant pathway in normal and castration sensitive 
prostate cancer cells. In the castrate environment it is sustained in part by [CONTACT_610140]23 including AR hypersensitivity  to very low 
intracellular levels of androgens24 and promiscuity for binding  other steroid hormones (such 
as progesterone and estradiol) 25. In addition, prostate cancer cells develop ligand independent 
mechanisms to synthesize their own androgens by [CONTACT_610141]26. Therefore, both pathways of AR activation remain 
activated in castration-resistant disease.
Antiandrogens regulate  AR function by [CONTACT_610142], by 
[CONTACT_610143]27 and by [CONTACT_610144]-activators to initiate transcription of target downstream genes28. In the clinic, antiandrogens, 
such as bicalutamide, have been  used in non-castrate  and castration resistant  prostate  cancer 
patients29. There is a strong rationale for considering the AR as a therapeutic target in recurrent,  
non-castrate prostate  cancer (BCR).
In the early 1990’s, single agent bicalutamide  (50 mg daily) was tested as 
monotherapy in metastatic prostate  cancer patients  with high PSA levels. By 3 months, 20% 
of patients  had a PSA decline of 85%, and by 6 months, 40% of the patients reached  a 90% 
decline. Those who achieved this response  had longer OS; however,  this was inferior to 
complete androgen blockade  (castration).  Single agent bicalutamide (50 mg daily) was also 
recently tested as one arm of ECOG 2809 study in patients with BCR and results are 
pending.
In another study, single agent bicalutamide at higher dose (150 mg daily)  was 
compared to combined androgen suppression with orchiectomy or Zoladex (LHRH agonist) 
and flutamide (an antiandrogen) in patients  with locally advanced prostate cancer. At 6.3 
years follow-up there was no statistical difference  between the two groups  in time to 
progression or OS (56%  mortality); however, there was a significant improvement in QOL in 
the bicalutamide  arm due to improved emotional well-being, physical capacity and sexual 
interest30.
In a smaller study 41 BCR patients were treated with high-dose  (150 mg) 
bicalutamide and finasteride (5α-reductase inhibitor) but no androgen deprivation therapy. 
Thirty-four of 36 evaluable patients reached  a PSA nadir  that represented a decline of PSA 
by 95.5%. The median time to treatment failure was 21.3 months in more advanced patients  
with median PSA values at study entry of 19.1 ng/mL.  At a follow  up of 3.9 years, disease  
control was comparable to castration31.
Monk et al32 used a combination of finasteride and flutamide  to treat 101 BCR 
patients with rising PSA between  1 and 10 ng/mL  after primary therapy. Combined 
peripheral androgen blockade regimens  achieved an undetectable (<0.2  ng/mL)  PSA in 40 - 
77% of patients depending  on whether the PSA levels at study entry were above or below  10

in 96% patients. The median time to PSA progression was 85 months. With a median follow-  
up of 10 years,  the median survival time had not been reached, and the 5-year OS rate was 
87%.
The existing data supports that in BCR patients starting hormone treatment achieving 
an undetectable PSA nadir (<0.2  ng/mL)  may predict for a longer survival than those whose 
PSA remains detectable. Thus, an undetectable  PSA nadir promises  to be the most accurate 
measure of disease  response  and an important endpoint for clinical trials evaluating new
approaches in hormone  naïve patients. However, PSA declines ≥ 85% may also be 
considered to explore the activity of novel  androgen-sparing combinations in a similar group 
and time frame.
1.3 Clinical Experience with Metformin
Metformin is a well-tolerated and inexpensive oral agent that is commonly used to 
treat diabetes  mellitus and insulin resistance. It reduces  serum glucose levels by [CONTACT_610145]33. By [CONTACT_610146], metformin reduces glucose  levels, increases 
insulin sensitivity and reduces hyperinsulinemia34. Metformin for the treatment of diabetes  
mellitus was approved in the 1970s in Europe and in 1995 in the [LOCATION_002]. Its use in 
diabetes has shown to increase OS and prevent macrovascular complications better than other  
oral hypoglycemic drugs35. Metformin today has a wide variety of clinical indications: 
polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), where insulin resistance is a key factor for the 
development of the metabolic disturbances. In this setting, it has a favorable effect on 
hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_10704]36. It is also used in the management of the metabolic 
syndrome37 and prevention  of diabetes  in high-risk population38.
Its most potentially dangerous toxicity is lactic acidosis (3 cases per 100,000 patient  
years). Lactic acidosis is extremely rare if metformin use is restricted to individuals without 
any of predisposing  conditions. Additional toxicities include: gastrointestinal (>1/10 - 
diarrhea, nausea,  vomiting,  abdominal bloating, flatulence, anorexia, metallic taste) which is 
usually transient when  treatment is started and resolving spontaneously with continued 
treatment, rash (< 1/10,000),  low vitamin B12 (9% after 6 months – it is suggested that 
vitamin B12 and/or hemoglobin levels be monitored at 6 - 12 months interval), hepatic  
dysfunction (<1/10,000), TSH elevations (< 1/10,000). Modest weight loss (up to five pounds)  
is common. Hypoglycemia does not normally occur when metformin is administered
– extreme caloric restriction or excessive physical activity without adequate caloric intake 
may rarely lead to hypoglycemia.

Version Date 08/05/2019activation of LKB1/AMPK pathway, inhibition of protein synthesis, induction of cell cycle 
arrest and/or apoptosis, reduction in circulating insulin levels, activation of the immune system 
and eradication of cancer stem cells.
The major link between  metformin and cancer is believed  to be the AMPK upstream  
kinase LKB1 (Fig.  1). Metformin activates LKB1 (tumor  suppressor protein  that is mutated 
in Peutz-Jeghers syndrome and inactivated in 30 – 50% NSCLC and other tumors39) and its 
downstream target AMPK, which, in turn, suppresses the activity of the mammalian target of 
rapamycin (mTOR), a signaling pathway with a central role in cancer cell growth and cancer 
pathogenesis. AMPK is a central cellular energy sensor whose activation leads to suppression 
of  many  of  the  processes  highly  dependent  on  ample  cellular  ATP  supply,  including
gluconeogenesis,  protein  and  fatty  acid  synthesis  and  cholesterol  biosynthesis,  while 
promoting catabolic processes such as fatty acid beta-oxidation and glycolysis40.
Several studies demonstrated that activation of AMPK plays a prominent role in 
mediating the effects of metformin41, 42. Metformin decreases ATP synthesis and a rise in the 
cellular AMP:ATP ratio, effectively mimicking conditions of cellular energy stress43. While 
most research into metformin action has focused  on insulin-responsive tissues, evidence 
suggests that cancer cells can initiate an AMPK-dependent energy stress response to 
metformin.
Another possible anticancer mechanism could be the decrease in circulating insulin 
levels since studies have demonstrated  that type II diabetes and obesity are associated with an 
increased risk of cancer. Cancer cells express insulin as well as insulin-like growth factor  
receptors (IGF-R) and that, besides its metabolic effect, IGF-R promotes  proliferation  and 
metastasis44. Hyperinsulinemia may promote  tumor growth  by [CONTACT_610147], such as proliferation of epi[INVESTIGATOR_255125], increasing bioavailability of steroid sex 
hormones and serum levels of insulin-like growth factors  (IGF), as well as disrupting the 
homeostasis of adipokines, which are cytokines selectively secreted by [CONTACT_610148]. Anticancer effects of metformin have  been  
demonstrated in a number of tumor model systems including the prostate, ovarian, breast,  
colorectal and endometrial carcinoma45-47.
Although typi[INVESTIGATOR_610114]1/AMPK/mTOR pathway or direct inhibition of insulin/IGF-mediated 
cellular proliferation, in reality  the mechanism of action of this drug is much more complex. 
Intriguingly, there are some novel  data to suggest metformin may specifically target cancer 
stem cells, which are hypothesized  to be resistant to conventional therapi[INVESTIGATOR_610115] a major 
reason for recurrence  following radiation  or chemotherapy48.
Interest in metformin as an anticancer agent began  when endocrinologists noticed that 
diabetic patients  taking metformin had a lower incidence of cancer. Evans et al. first described 
an association between  metformin and decreased  cancer  incidence in 200549. Several other  
retrospective studies showed that patients with diabetes taking metformin were less likely to

Retrospective analysis of data from the ZODIAC trial, whose primary outcomes  were 
diabetes-related complications, revealed that cancer related mortality was lower in patients  
taking metformin (HR 0.43; 95% CI 0.23 – 0.80)50.
Noto and colleagues reported meta-analysis with 11,117 (5.3%) cases of incident 
cancer at any site reported among 210,892 patients in 10 studies (2 RCTs, 6 cohort studies, 2 
case-control studies). The risks of cancer among metformin users were significantly lower 
than those among non-metformin  users: the pooled RRs (95% CI) were 0.66 (0.49–0.88) for 
cancer mortality, 0.67 (0.53–0.85) for all-cancer incidence, 0.68 (0.53–0.88) for colorectal
cancer (n = 6), 0.20 (0.07–0.59) for hepatocellular cancer (n = 4), 0.67 (0.45–0.99) for lung 
cancer (n = 3)51.

and colleagues showed that metformin caused 50% decrease in cell viability in human 
prostate cancer cell lines (DU145, PC-3 and LNCaP) compared with only a modest 20% 
decrease in a normal  prostate cell line (P69), suggesting that metformin may specifically 
target the prostate  cancer cells45. Metformin was also reported to activate AMPK and to 
cause growth  inhibition in prostate and colon cancer cells52.
Study published by [CONTACT_610149]. suggested that mechanism for the anti-tumor activity of  
metformin  in  prostate  cancer  cell  lines  is  independent  of  its  anti-diabetic  effects53.  
Metformin disrupted  the AR translational MID1 regulator complex leading to release  of the 
associated AR mRNA and subsequently to down-regulation of AR protein in AR positive  
cell lines. Metformin reduced levels of cyclin D in prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo 
and blocked cell cycle in G(0)/G(1) phase.  Interestingly, this effect was independent of 
AMKP, and it was only observed in malignant cells and not normal prostate cells54.
Colquhoun and colleagues randomized LNCaP prostate cancer xenografts on a high-  
carbohydrate, high-fat (HC-HF)  diet into four treatment groups; control (n=16, vehicle only),  
metformin alone (n=8), bicalutamide alone (n=9) or combined metformin and bicalutamide  
(n=8). Metformin was dissolved in cell culture medium and was administered at a dose of 50 
mg/kg. Bicalutamide was dissolved in DMSO and was also administered at a dose of 100 
μg/kg. Both drugs  were administered on days 12, 14, 16, 19, 21 and 23 by [CONTACT_610150]. Treatment with metformin and/or bicalutamide was well tolerated. Study revealed  
no significant difference in tumor volume in mice treated with metformin when compared 
with untreated control mice (P = 0.15). Conversely, mice treated with bicalutamide had 
significantly smaller tumors than untreated control mice (P = 0.02), and mice treated with a 
combination of metformin and bicalutamide had highly significantly smaller tumors than 
untreated mice (P < 0.0004). Serum PSA was significantly elevated in all treatment groups  at 
the experiment termination, compared with levels obtained before treatment 
(P=0.001).Treatment with metformin did not reduce PSA levels significantly (P=0.97),  
whereas treatment with bicalutamide  or the combination of metformin + bicalutamide  
significantly reduced PSA levels (34.0 and 19.0 ng/ml,  respectively, P=0.002). The serum 
PSA level for the combination treatment regimen  was significantly lower than that for either

In a population-based case–control study of 1001 patients with prostate  cancer and 
942 controls, metformin use was associated with a 44% risk reduction in prostate cancer

Version Date 08/05/2019patients not on metformin, and 2582 non-diabetic  patients) with localized prostate  cancer 
treated with external-beam radiation  therapy from 1992 to 2008. With a median follow-up of
8.7 years,  the 10-yr actuarial rates  for metformin, diabetic non-metformin, and nondiabetic  
patients for prostate cancer specific mortality were 2.7%, 21.9%, and 8.2% (log-rank p ≤ 
0.001)57. Surprisingly, metformin strongly decreased the clinically defined transformation to 
CRPC which at the end may improve prostate  cancer specific mortality57.
Margel et al58 reported that duration of metformin treatment among diabetic men after 
a diagnosis of prostate cancer was associated with decreased  prostate cancer–specific and all- 
cause mortality. This population-based observational cohort study included 3,[ADDRESS_809036] been diagnosed with diabetes followed by 
a diagnosis of prostate cancer. By [CONTACT_129746]-up  in 2009 (median, 4.64 years), 1,343 
men had died (35%), including 291 (7.6%) from prostate cancer. Prostate cancer–specific 
mortality was decreased  by 24% for each additional 6 months of metformin use after diagnosis; 
use of other  antidiabetic medications did not significantly decrease prostate  cancer–specific 
mortality.
Metformin as a single agent has shown modest therapeutic activity in patients with 
castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).  A single arm Phase II study enrolled 42 patients  
with chemotherapy naïve mCRPC treated with metformin 1000 mg twice daily until disease  
progression (defined as PSA increase 25% above baseline, progression of measurable disease  
or bone lesions, clinical progression, and start of palliative  radiotherapy or death at week 12). 
36% of patients were progression-free  at 12 weeks, 9.1%  were progression-free at 24 weeks, 
and in two patients  had ≥ 50% PSA decline.  In 23 patients (52.3%)  a prolongation of PSADT 
was observed.  Additionally, insulin sensitivity markers improved by 26% in the first 12 
weeks of treatment. This study demonstrated that treatment with metformin is safe in non- 
diabetic patients59.
Joshua et al. reported the results of the study of 24 men (median age 64, median PSA 
6 ng/mL)  with confirmed prostate cancer that were given 500 mg of metformin three times a 
day before the surgery (neoadjuvant treatment). Median duration  of drug treatment was 41 
days (range 18 - 81). No grade  3 adverse events were reported, all patients  underwent  
subsequent radical  prostatectomy with no adverse events related to metformin. Significant 
pre-and postoperative  changes were noted in serum IGF1 (p=0.02), fasting glucose (p=0.03),  
BMI (p<0.01). PSA reduction was not statistically significant (p=0.08). In addition, 
metformin reduced Ki67 proliferation index by 29%,  compared to the baseline  biopsy60 .
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_610117]'s antineoplastic 
activity, the clinical evidence has been confusing. Although metformin does not appear to be 
associated with a reduced prostate  cancer risk or with a reduced risk for recurrence after 
surgery61; there is strong suggestion that metformin may reduce risk of castration resistant  
disease development and death  from prostate cancer by 25% to 45%62, 63 .

Version Date 08/05/[ZIP_CODE].6 Obesity and prostate cancer
Two-thirds of the adult  male population in the US is overweight or obese64 and excess 
bodyweight deregulates  several pathways such insulin levels, free insulin growth factor  1 (IGF-
1), adiponectin, and sex hormones that could potentially affect prostate cancer outcomes.  
Several studies have demonstrated association between  obesity and the incidence of prostate 
and other  cancers65. It has been postulated  that increased insulin resistance  and adipokines may 
play an important role 66. Circulating levels of adiponectin and leptin in obese patients may also 
be important in prostate cancer  pathogenesis67. Adiponectin levels (inhibitory adipokine) are 
reduced in obese patients, while  leptin levels are increased, which at the end may promote 
prostate cancer growth68. This theory  is supported  by [CONTACT_610151]69. Hyperinsulinemia and 
metabolic syndrome may play a role in carcinogenesis and be negatively associated  with 
prostate cancer prognosis70. Increased insulin level  decreases sex hormone-binding globulins,  
and causing  an increase in free unbound androgens which at the end may lead to worse 
prognosis71. In prostate cancer patients  treated with RP, obesity  was associated with higher-
grade tumors, a trend toward increased risk of positive surgical margins, and higher 
biochemical failure  rates72. In diabetic patients, obesity is associated with higher risk of 
high-risk prostate cancer, which is independent of the lower risk for prostate  cancer in 
diabetic patients73. The lower risk for prostate cancer in diabetic  patients is possibly explained 
by [CONTACT_610152]74. Another retrospective  study showed that the 
presence of metabolic syndrome was associated with a shorter median time to progression (16 
vs 36 months) and median OS (36.5  vs. 46.7 months) in prostate  cancer patients receiving  
ADT75 .
Cao and Ma recently reported a meta-analysis of six post-diagnosis  survival studies 
on 18,203  patients  with 932 deaths and found that 5 kg/m(2) increase in BMI was associated 
with 20% higher  prostate cancer-specific mortality. The sixteen studies followed 26,479 
prostate cancer patients after their primary  treatment, a 5 kg/m(2) increase in BMI was 
significantly associated with 21% increased risk of BCR (RR:  1.21, 95% CI: 1.11-1.31 P < 
0.01). This study demonstrated that elevated BMI is associated with increased risk of 
biochemical recurrence and prostate  cancer-specific mortality76. Unanswered question is does 
weight loss reduce the risk of recurrence, the development of metastases, and death from  
prostate in men with the disease?

Version Date 08/05/2019both insulin-dependent and insulin-independent mechanisms, which involve activation of 
adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK), inhibiting mTOR 
signaling pathway77. Recent evidence suggests activation of AMPK leads to down  regulation  
of AR78 and inhibits xenograft growth of several PCa cell lines54. Metformin should work 
better in early, castrate sensitive prostate cancer since in castration resistant disease AR 
signaling is increased (through amplification, mutations, and intracellular androgen 
stimulation) which may hamper metformin's ability to inhibit cancer growth.
Bicalutamide is a non-steroidal antiandrogen, which functions by [CONTACT_610153]. It 
exerts its effect predominantly  through induction of a G1/S phase arrest of the cell cycle79. 
Published preclinical data suggest the additive anticancer effects of combining metformin 
and bicalutamide in the prostate  cancer patients with metabolic syndrome and possible  
synergistic activity with antiandrogens: in AR-positive cells, this effect appeared to be 
mediated by [CONTACT_610154], whereas in AR-negative cells 
the combination treatment appeared to promote apoptosis.
HYPOTHESIS:
Metformin will enhance the antitumor effects of the antiandrogen bicalutamide in the 
setting of preserved  testosterone, effectively delaying onset  of metastases while preserving  
quality of life in overweight and obese men with castrate naïve non-metastatic prostate  
cancer with biochemical recurrence.

Version Date 08/05/2019All toxicities should be graded according to the Version 4.0 of the NCI Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). Dose modifications will  be based  on the 
highest grade  since the prior dose and will be performed as outlined  below depending on 
the type and severity of the toxicity encountered, provided that the criteria have  not been  
met for subject withdrawal from  study. Patients will be withdrawn from the study if they

5.5.1. Dose Modifications for Metformin
The major toxic effects of metformin which limit dose are gastrointestinal (nausea,  
abdominal bloating, diarrhea). During the ramp-up period,  subjects experiencing 
gastrointestinal symptoms should be encouraged to take tablets with food. If no 
improvement, subjects should try taking study medication every other day for two 
weeks, once per day for two weeks and then twice per day thereafter. Subjects not 
tolerating study medication after this approach may go off study treatment but 
Investigators are urged to re-challenge willing subjects 4 weeks later. Dose 
adjustments, for reasons of toxicity, will be as in the tables below.  (Please note that 
none of the recommended dose adjustments require splitting of study medication 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353]. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_187972], prior to taking, for any reason.) Breaks of up 
to 4 weeks consecutively or 8 weeks overall  are allowed to ascertain the cause of the

Medication should be resumed  according to the algorithms above (if first 
biochemistry results are normal, resume  immediately at full dose)
Other Situations
Diagnostic Imaging:
If the subject is scheduled for any CT scans requiring intravenous contrast 
material, metformin should not be taken for 24 hours prior to the investigation 
or for 48 hours after the procedure.  (This does not include contrast used for 
MRI or nuclear medicine scans, including MUGA). Study medication will 
then be resumed at full dose (without ramp-up)  provided there is no 
concern about renal  function. If there is concern about renal function, 
creatinine should be checked prior  to resumption  of study medication.
General Anesthetic:
If general  anesthetic is required for surgery, study drug should not be taken 
on the morning of surgery or for 48 hours after anesthetic and surgery. 
Study medication will then be resumed at full dose (without ramp-up) 
provided there is no concern about renal  function.  The drug is restarted at 
full dose if the duration of interruption was less than 2 weeks. If the duration 
of drug interruption was more than 2 weeks, it should be restarted using a 4 
week ramp-up schedule (one caplet per day for 4 weeks, then two caplets per 
day). If there is concern about renal function, creatinine should be checked 
prior to resumption  of study medication.
Any Situation Considered Medically Necessary:
Study medication may be held in any situation which the Investigator considers it 
medically necessary, for up to 4 weeks.
5.5.2. Dose Modifications for Bicalutamide
Not allowed. In case of CTCAE grade 3 or 4 transaminase elevation, bicalutamide

7.1 Definitions of Biochemical Response and Progression
7.1.1 Complete Response: PSA <0.2 ng/mL  confirmed on two consecutive

Copyright© 2015 Fox Chase Cancer  Center® Office  of Clinical Research. All rights reserved.
Version Date 10/30/2017additional determinations taken at least 4 weeks apart.
7.1.2 Partial Response: A reduction in PSA ≥ 50% from baseline without 
evidence of clinical or radiographic progression confirmed on two 
consecutive additional determinations taken at least 4 weeks apart.
7.1.3 Stable Disease: Patients who do not meet the criteria for response  
(CR or PR) or serological progression for at least 3 months (90 days) 
will be categorized as having stable disease.
7.1.4 Progressive Disease:
1)For patient who achieved a ≥ 50% decline in PSA, progression is 
defined as an increase in PSA value  by 50% above baseline  or nadir  
(whichever is lowest), confirmed by a second PSA rise at least two 
weeks later. The PSA rise must be at least 5 ng/mL. Changes in PSA 
below 5 ng/mL will not be considered assessable for progression.
2)For patients with an undetectable PSA nadir (< 0.2 ng/mL),  
progression is defined as a PSA rise to the detectable  range (detectable  
PSA is ≥ 0.2 ng/mL)  confirmed by a second PSA rise at least 2 weeks 
later.
3)For patients whose PSA has not decreased by 50%, progression is 
defined as an increase in PSA value  ≥ 50% of baseline (on trial) or 
nadir PSA, whichever is lowest, confirmed by a repeat PSA at least [ADDRESS_809070] 5 ng/mL.
7.2 Radiographic Progression
The appearance of new lesions on examination or radiographs (CXR,  CT 
scan, MRI scan, or bone  scan) with or without a concurrent increase in serum 
PSA from baseline.

The change in PSA slope (and PSADT) pre-study,  during-study, and off-study 
will be determined to see if the treatments have any disease modifying effects, 
especially in those patients  experiencing stable disease. This end-point is 
exploratory, but may help to interpret PSA response.
7.7 Symptomatic Deterioration
Patients with a global  deterioration of health  status requiring discontinuation  
of treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time 
should be classified as having symptomatic deterioration.
7.8 Duration of Response
The period measured from the time that PSA criteria are met for complete or 
partial response (whichever status is recorded first) until the first date that 
progressive disease  is documented.
7.9 Quality of life (QOL)
Quality of life will be assessed during the screening visit and after the study 
completion using The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate 
(FACT-P) questionnaire. It is a relevant,  worldwide tool used for assessing the 
health-related quality  of life in men with prostate cancer.

institution.
8.2Tissue Collection
The collection of a representative  block of the diagnostic tumor tissue (if 
available) is an important part of this trial; however, the participation of 
subjects is optional. Blocks will be carefully banked as part of the Fox Chase 
tissue/tumor bank. Tumor blocks will be the preferred material to collect, as 
one of the objectives will be to create tissue micro arrays. These will optimize  
the amount of tissue available to investigators and permit the preservation  of 
the tumor block submitted. If, at any time, the submitting hospi[INVESTIGATOR_610122], it will be returned by

The tissue may be used by [CONTACT_610162]. Samples 
will be used for research  purposes only and will not be sold. Patients will not 
be identified by [CONTACT_2300]. The only identification of tissue will be by a patient 
study number assigned at the time of randomization to the trial the surgical/ 
histology number and/or patient initials. Material issued to
researchers will be anonymized and only identified by a coded number.  
Diagnostic pathology reports  are received  as part of the supporting 
documentation required for this trial. Testing for hereditary genetic defects  
predisposing to malignant disease will not be carried out without the 
expressed consent of the subject. All subjects on whom a diagnostic tumor 
block is collected will be aware of this retrieval and will have given their 
consent.
8.2.1 Use of Tumor Blocks
As part of the embedded correlative science for the protocol,  the following  
research is planned  using  archival tissue samples collected and banked at the 
time of study entry:
a)Insulin Receptor (IR)
We plan to quantify IR expression by [CONTACT_610163].
b)LKB1
We plan to quantify  LBK1 expression by [CONTACT_610164].  LKB1 expression is key to the ability of metformin to 
affect AMPK activity within tumors and to suppress the growth- 
promoting outputs of this signaling pathway (i.e. mTOR-regulated 
protein translation). LKB1 expression is essential for direct  (insulin  
independent) effects of metformin.
c)Phosphoantibody Markers of Activation of Key Signaling Pathways 
Expression of IR and LKB1 will be indicative of the capacity of tumor cells to 
respond to indirect (insulin and IR mediated) and direct  (insulin  independent,   
LKB1   mediated)   effects   of   metformin   respectively,  however, the 
expression of these factors cannot distinguish whether the pathways  underling  
these  responses  are  actually  activated.  Multiple other genetic factors  may alter 
pathway activation. As a result, activation markers of these pathways  [PI3K 
(STMN1), PKB/Akt (P-PKB/Akt,) mTOR (P-4E-BP1) and IRS-1 (P-IRS-1)] 
will be evaluated as predictors  of metformin benefit.  If one or more of these 
biomarkers a re activated at prostate  cancer  diagnosis,  it  is  predicted  that  
metformin  benefit  is possible.  If none  of these pathways is activated, it is 
predicted that metformin  benefit   will  not  be  seen,  regardless  of  IR  and/or

8.3Use of Blood Samples
Correlative studies will be an integrated component of the clinical trial. Investigations  
of fasting glucose and insulin levels at baseline,  [ADDRESS_809074]: 4E-BPI [INVESTIGATOR_1238] p70S6K1, IGF-1/IGFBP-3 (observed on peripheral  
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).
a)Genomic/Gene Expression Profile Predictive of Metformin Benefit Large-scale 
genomic studies over the past two decades  have identified numerous recurrent 
genetic e vents in prostate cancer.  More recent  studies are focusing on building  a 
comprehensive, genome-wide  understanding  of various  types of prostate cancer. 
We plan to use such analyses to search for a genomic/gene expression profile  
predictive of metformin benefit.  In the case of observed metformin benefit,  we 
will perform comprehensive genomic/gene expression analysis of peripheral  
blood and available tumor material. Considering rapid technical advances in the 
genomic analysis arena, at the time of analysis, we will choose the most 
appropriate methodology to delineate  the genetic/gene  expression predictors of 
metformin benefit.
b)Blood Collection and Analysis Investigation of a core group of blood variables  
(at baseline, 9 weeks after enrolment and at the end of treatment) and tumor related  
factors (at diagnosis)  will be examined as predictors of metformin benefit in this 
trial is outlined  below. We will also collect additional samples that will allow us 
to examine a broader array of both prognostic and predictive  factors in future 
work. The blood collection for fasting glucose  and insulin is a mandatory part 
of the baseline,  [ADDRESS_809075] 12 hours, participants will provide  the following 
blood specimens: 1 tube for immediate glucose  analysis (performed  according to 
established institutional practice), light green  topped tubes (containing lithium 
heparin - for plasma), red topped tubes (for serum) and lavender topped tube (for 
DNA). Lavender topped tubes for DNA should be collected even for patients  
who consent to blood  banking but refuse genetic  testing. DNA may be used to 
study gene  expression without fitting the definition of genetic testing. The 
green  topped tubes will be centrifuged within half an hour of collection and the 
plasma collected frozen  immediately in 1 ml aliquots at -80°C. The red topped 
tubes will sit for 30 minutes at room temperature and then be centrifuged and 
the collected serum frozen immediately in 1 ml aliquots at -80°C.  Lavender topped 
tubes (whole blood in EDTA) will be collected and frozen at -80°C  in 1 ml 
aliquots for subsequent thawing and DNA extraction. Specimens will be stored at

laboratory, frozen on dry ice, in batches of 10 sets or more (1 set = entire 
blood  collection at one patient  visit), for subsequent storage and ultimate  analysis. 
Our plan to collect lymphocytes for DNA at both baseline and at the end of 
study (week 33) will provide the necessary sample to evaluate not only 
germline DNA but also potential  changes in DNA methylation as a result of the 
metformin intervention.
In addition  to blood samples collection  listed above additional blood samples will 
be collected at the NCI site for  immune assessments in  some patients (exploratory): 
6 (10mL) green top sodium heparin tubes for PBMC and 2 (8mL) SST  tubes  for 
serum samples)  at baseline,  week 9 and week  32 (end of study). Immune 
assessments will be  performed at the Laboratory of Tumor Immunology and  
Biology at the  NCI’s Center for Cancer Research  (CCR) and will include flow 
cytometry-based and serum assays. Samples will be  analyzed in batches after 
enrolling all patients in order to ensure  best laboratory practices  and quality data. 
From samples acquired the following assays will be performed: 
1Analyses of PBMCs:  PBMCs separated  by [CONTACT_138789]-Hypaque density 
gradient centrifugation, will be analyzed for changes in standard 
immune cell types  (CD4 and CD8 T cells,  natural killer [NK] cells, 
regulatory T cells [Tregs],  myeloid-derived suppressor cells 
[MDSCs], and dendritic cells) as well as 123 immune cell subsets,  as 
described elsewhere (Lepone et al 2016)80.
2Analyses of soluble factors: Sera will be analyzed pre- and post-
therapy for the following soluble factors: sCD27 and sCD40  ligand.
3Additional assays: Blood samples may be used for additional research  
studies, which  may include phenotypic and functional analysis of 
immune-cell subsets (such as CD4 and CD8 T cells, NK cells, Tregs,  
and MDSC), T cell clonality,  circulating tumor cells, RNA and 
proteomic analyses, and analyses of cytokines  (such as IFN-γ, IL-10, 
IL-12, IL-2,  IL-4,  etc.), chemokines, antibodies, tumor-associated 
antigens, and/or other markers.
c)Insulin (plasma)
Our core analyses will explore the indirect, insulin mediated, effect of metformin 
as a predictor  of invasive disease free survival (primarily), overall survival and 
prostate  cancer free interval, including an evaluation of both baseline fasting 
insulin (primarily), change in insulin over 9 weeks (secondarily) and at the end 
of treatment. This primary  focus  on insulin reflects the recognition  that insulin 
at diagnosis is a prognostic factor in prostate  cancer, and it reflects  the major 
impact metformin has on insulin levels; our hypothesis is that higher insulin

Version Date 10/30/2017level at baseline will predict  metformin benefit in the overall study population. 
Additionally, in exploratory analyses we will examine the relationship between  
changes in insulin level during  the first 6 months of metformin administration.
d)Glucose (plasma)
We plan to examine whether baseline  glucose  predicts metformin benefit 
independent of insulin or whether glucose modifies effects of insulin as a 
predictor of metformin benefit.  We will also investigate Homeostasis Model 
Assessment (HOMA), an empi[INVESTIGATOR_610123] a single measure of fasting  insulin and glucose that correlates 
well with the gold standard frequently  sampled intravenous  glucose tolerance 
test, as a predictor of metformin benefit,  focusing on whether it provides  
additional prediction  beyond insulin alone

9.0 BACKGROUND THERAPEUTIC INFORMATION
9.1 Metformin (Please refer t o the package  insert for m ore comprehensive 
information.)
9.1.1 Availiability: Metformin is commercially available
9.1.2 Other Names: Glucophage; Glumetza; 1,1-Dimethylbiguanide;  
Metiguanide; Diabex; Dimethylbiguanide; Metforminum; Diabetosan; 
Fluamine: a commercially available agent.
9.1.3 Chemical Name: 3-(diaminomethylidene)-1,1-dimethylguanidine
9.1.4 Molecular Formula: C4H11N5
Metformin HCl is a white crystalline powder soluble in water and 95% ethyl 
alcohol. It is practically insoluble in ether and in chloroform. Melting Point: 
218-220o C
9.1.5 Mode of Action:
Metformin HCl is a biguanide derivative  producing an antihyperglycemic 
effect which can only be observed  in man or in the diabetic animal and only 
when there is insulin secretion. Metformin, at therapeutic doses,  does not 
cause hypoglycemia when used alone in man or in the non-diabetic animal, 
except when using  a near lethal dose. Metformin has no effects on the 
pancreatic beta cells. The mode of action of metformin is not fully understood.  
It has been postulated that metformin might potentiate  the effect of insulin or 
reduce hepatic gluconeogenesis. Metformin absorption is relatively  slow and 
may extend over about 6 hours. The drug is excreted in urine at high renal  
clearance rate of about 450 mL/min. The initial elimination of metformin is 
rapid with a half-life  varying  between 1.7 and 3 hours.  The terminal 
elimination phase accounting for about 4 to 5 % of the absorbed dose is slow 
15-1015
34
Copyright© 2015 Fox Chase Cancer  Center® Office  of Clinical Research. All rights reserved.
Version Date 10/30/2017with a halflife between 9 and 17 hours. Metformin is not metabolized. Its 
main sites of concentration are the intestinal mucosa and the salivary glands.  
The plasma concentration at steady-state ranges about 1 to 2 mcg/mL. Certain 
drugs may potentiate the effect of metformin HCl, particularly sulfonylurea 
type of drugs  in the treatment of diabetes. The simultaneous administration of 
these two types of drugs could produce a hypoglycemic reaction, especially if 
they are given in patients already receiving  other drugs which, themselves, 
can potentiate the effect of sulfonylureas. These drugs can be: long-acting 
sulfonamides, tubercolostatics, phenylbutazone,  clofibrate, monoamine 
oxidase inhibitors, salicylates, probenecid and propanolol. In healthy  
volunteers, the pharmacokinetics of propranolol and ibuprofen were not 
affected by [CONTACT_188026]-administered in single-dose interaction 
studies.
Metformin is negligibly  bound  to plasma proteins and is, therefore, less likely 
to interact with highly protein-bound drugs such as salicylates, sulfonamides, 
chloramphenicol, and probenecid, as compared to sulfonylureas, which are 
extensively bound to serum proteins.
Human Toxicity
In man, no adverse effect has been reported on liver or kidney function, the 
hematopoietic system or on the blood vessels.  The reported incidence of lactic acidosis 
in patients receiving  metformin hydrochloride is very low (approximately
0.03 cases / 1000 patient/years with approximately 0.015 fatal cases / 1000 
patient/years). The consecutive administration of both phenformin  and metformin to 
the same patient has allowed for the demonstration of a fundamental difference  
between these two biguanides in relation to lactacidemia. In some instances, patients  
developed hyperlactacidemia with phenformin when the same patients were 
presenting normal lactic acid levels while being  treated with metformin. In other  
instances, hyperlactacidemia observed  during a treatment with phenformin did regress  
when metformin was substituted for phenformin. Metformin may increase 
lactacidemia but to a degree that is clinically less significant than the elevation seen 
after phenformin.
Teratology
Teratological studies were carried out in albino rats divided  in three groups: No 
abnormalities were found,  even when high doses were administered. The number of 
animals was the same in each group. Death rate in the three groups of treated animals 
and controls was approximately the same. However, the number of living animals in 
each group treated was slightly lower than in the control group. Also, the frequency  
of litters exceeding 10 live animals was slightly higher in the control group. A loss of 
weight at the time of weaning has been observed  when compared to the control 
group. Nevertheless, on a statistical basis, differences were shown to be non- 
significant. There is no difference between the groups  of treated animals and the 
control group regarding the number of stillborn. The number of deaths after birth was 
slightly higher in metformin treated groups than in the control group, but the

10.0  ADVERSE EVENTS
10.1Definition of Adverse Experience
10.1.1 Adverse Events (AE) is any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease  temporally associated with the 
use of a medicinal (investigational)  product,  treatment or procedure regardless  of 
whether it is considered related to the medical treatment or procedure (NCI CTEP 
Guidelines March 28, 2011).
10.1.2 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is an AE that is fatal or life threatening, 
requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29350] (for > 
24 hours), persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal  life functions, or is a congenital anomaly/ birth defect,   
or results in any important medical event that may not result in death, be life 
threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_236907], based  
upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject and may require  
medical or surgical intervention to prevent  any of the above outcomes. A “life- 
threatening” adverse event places  the patient at immediate risk of death in the 
judgment of the investigator or sponsor.
10.1.3 Severity Rating
The investigator will evaluate the severity of each adverse event. NCI Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v.4.0) or study specific toxicity

Version Date 10/30/2017tables provided in the protocol define  severity. If not included in CTCAE      
v.4.0, severity is expressed in numerical grade  using the following definitions:
1.Grade 1: Mild-asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic  
observations only; intervention not indicated.
2.Grade 2: Moderate-minimal, local or noninvasive  intervention indicated; 
limiting age appropriate instrumental ADL.
3.Grade 3: Severe-severe or medically significant but not immediately life- 
threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_610125]; 
disabling; limiting self care ADL.
4.Grade 4: Life-threatening consequences; urgent  intervention indicated.
5.Grade 5: Death related  to AE
10.1.4 Attribution/Relationship to study drug
Definite – clearly related
Probable – likely related
Possible – may be related
Unlikely – doubtfully related
Unrelated – clearly not related
10.1.5 Expectedness
An Expected Adverse Event is one where the specificity or severity is consistent 
with the current information available from the resources.
An Unexpected Adverse Event is one where the nature, severity, or frequency of 
the event is related to participation in the research is not consistent with either:
1.The known or foreseeable risk of adverse events associated with the 
procedures involved in the research that are described in (a) the protocol-related  
documents, such as the IRB-approved research protocol, any applicable 
investigator brochure,  and the current IRB-approved  informed consent document,  
and (b) other relevant sources of information, such as product  labeling and 
package inserts: or
2.The expected natural progression of any underlying disease,  disorder,  or 
condition of the subject (s) experiencing the adverse event and the subjects(s) 
predisposing risk factor  profile for the adverse event.
(OHRP Guidance on reviewing  unanticipated  problems 2007)
10.2Recording and Reporting Responsibilities
10.2.1 Investigative  site recording responsibilities:
1. Upon identification of an AE or SAE, the site investigator will utilize the 
above definitions to properly classify the event. Each category listed above must 
be recorded for each event.
2. All AEs and SAEs will be recorded  in the “AE case report forms”  (CRF)

epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], action taken with respect to the study drug, and the patient’s outcome  
will be recorded in the CRF. All events will be recorded on case report forms for 
the duration of the study until they resolve.
3. All reportable SAEs will be recorded  on the FDA MedWatch form  3500a. 
After submitting the initial report it may be necessary to submit follow  up reports 
to the Sponsor should the event require further investigation.
10.2.2 Investigative  site reporting responsibilities:
1.The investigator/ site is responsible to report all SAEs which occur on or after 
the first day of treatment to the sponsor within [ADDRESS_809076] 
treatment.
2. Each investigator is responsible  to report  all AEs/SAEs to their local IRB 
following guidelines  set by [CONTACT_412959]. The FCCC OCR reserves the right to 
request an event be reported to the IRB at their discretion. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_610126] [EMAIL_11608] . 
3. If the investigator or IRB feels the event warrants a revision  to the informed

Version Date 10/30/2017We will test the hypothesis that only 20% of patients on either arm of the study will 
have undetectable PSA at 32 weeks, versus the alternative that 40% of arm B patients  will. 
An initial cohort of 39 patients and, if continued, a second cohort of 27 patients will be 
randomized 2:1 to arms B and A respectively.
After stratification for prior therapy we will randomize, 2:1, nominally  [ADDRESS_809079] 
simply described  by [CONTACT_1959] (E1/26)  – (C1/13),  where C1 and E1 are the numbers of 
undetectable PSAs in arms A and B respectively. The cut point for continuation of the trial 
past the first cohort requires that
(E1/26) – (C1/13) > -2/13 = -0.1538462…. To avoid confusion due to round off of such 
fractions, we identify the decision boundary  by 13 E1 – 26 C1 > -52, exactly equivalent the 
first expression, and obtained by [CONTACT_610166] 13*26.
If 13 E1 – [ADDRESS_809080] the null hypothesis  if 22(E1 + 
E2) – 44(C1 + C2) is at least 88 and E1 + E2 is at least 14. The initial cohort will consist of 
39 and the final cohort of 27 patients for a total of 66 patients. If the true null is 20% 
undetectable PSAs type I error will be 3.24%  and power will be 80.3%. In this case the 
chance of early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_610129] 60% but will be 3.23% if the true arm B 
fraction of undetectable  PSAs is 40%.
If the null (arm A) fraction undetectable  PSAs is 25% type I error increases to 10.9% 
and power  increases to 83.3%  if the arm B fraction undetectable is 45% (20% higher).  If the 
null fraction  is 30% type I error increases to 19.7% and power to 83.2% (arm B 50%, 20% 
higher).
The above discussion is based on the exact 2:[ADDRESS_809081] 80% and type I error is less than 5%. Type I error 
when the null fraction is 30% is always under 20%. To use the table we compute nc1 E1 – 
ne1 C1 where nc1 and ne1 are the actual numbers of arm A and arm B respectively in the 
initial cohort of 39. If this number, nc1 E1 – ne1 C1 > -a1, and E1 > m1 in the table, then the 
trial may be continued past the initial cohort. Otherwise it is terminated and the null hypothesis 
accepted. If the second cohort is recruited,  then nc2(E1+E2)  – ne2(C1+C2) must be computed. 
nc2 and ne2 are the total numbers of patients in arms A and B respectively. If nc2(E1+E2) – 
ne2(C1+C2) is at least r and E1+E2 is at least m2 in the table, then the null hypothesis will 
be rejected. The table is indexed by [INVESTIGATOR_161491]1 and nc2 only. This is so because  nc1+ne1  = 39 
invariably as does nc2+ne2 = 66. For example, suppose nc1 = 13 hence ne1 = 26. Then if E1 
= 7 and C1 = 4, E1 > m1 = 6 and 13 E1 – 26 C1 = 13 * 7 – 26 * 4 = 91 – 104
= -13, and -13 > -52, so the second cohort would be recruited.  Finally, suppose nc2 = 22 
hence ne2 = 44 and suppose E2 = 9 and C2 = 2. Then E1+E2 = 9+7=16 > m2=14 and 
22(E1+E2) – 44(C1+C2) = 22*16 – 44*6 = 352-264 =[ADDRESS_809082] r = 88. In this case 
the null hypothesis would be rejected.

11.2  Toxicity assessment
A DLT rate of 20% will be considered excessive for arm B. A rate of 5% is expected and 
acceptable. If [ADDRESS_809083] 80% chance of declaring arm B too toxic 
when the true DLT rate is 20%. This chance under the null is about 1%. The chance of 
halting the trial early is over 57% for a 20% DLT rate and less than 1% if this rate is only 
5%.
11.[ADDRESS_809084] 
85% reduction  in PSA at 32 weeks will be the same. We will sort the 66 patients 32 week 
PSAs into groups above or below their grand median 32 week PSA.  We will then submit the 
doubly dichotomized  data to Fisher’s exact test. The test will distinguish an odds  ratio of
3.19 from  one of 1.0 with 80% power  and at most 10% type I error.
We will characterize the time to PSA progression and the time to onset of metastatic disease  
using the method of Kaplan and Meier. We will compare arms A and B for each of these end 
points with log-rank tests. Patients will be followed for PSA progression and for onset of 
metastatic disease for at least 60 months.
11.4Definition of Populations for Analyses
All Treated Subjects: all subjects who are treated with bicalutamide  (arm A) or 
bicalutamide and metformin (Arm  B). All Randomized Subjects: all subjects who received  
treatment.
11.5Safety Analyses
Safety analyses will be conducted on treated patients. All adverse events will be 
summarized 1) without regard to causal relationship and 2) by [CONTACT_610167], based  on the Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]. Worst toxicity grades per subject will be tabulated 
for selected adverse events and laboratory measurements. Any serious adverse event or

described in detail. Adverse events and other  symptoms will be graded according to the 
National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) Version 4.[ADDRESS_809085] accrual. All serious adverse events (SAEs) will be reviewed on a real time basis first 
by [CONTACT_314478] [INVESTIGATOR_610130]-Investigator as applicable.
12.2Data Safety Monitoring Board
Interim analysis of toxicity, outcome  and ongoing scientific investigations will be 
performed at least every [ADDRESS_809086] (FCCC DSMB). In this capacity the FCCC DSMB will serve as an advisory committee 
to the Sponsor-Investigator. The FCCC DSMB will review those aspects of this trial that are 
outlined in the responsibilities section of the Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP). If 
the committee decides  that changes should be made to this trial, it will make recommendations 
in writing to the Sponsor-Investigator, the Associate Director of Clinical Research, and the 
Protocol Management Executive Committee, which, in turn, have  the authority to approve or 
disapprove these recommendations. These changes will be discussed with the Sponsor-
Investigator before they are implemented. These changes may include early termination of 
accrual. Other changes might include altering the accrual goals  or changing the eligibility 
criteria for the trial.

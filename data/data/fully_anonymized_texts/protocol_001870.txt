Hepatitis C virus (HCV) chronically infects over 170 million people worldwide.1-3  
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a leading cause of chronic liver disease and the leading 
indication for liver transplantation in the U nited States (US) with estimates of more 
than [ADDRESS_865291] all oral directl y acting antivirals (DAAs).  It is expected that 
treatment rates will increase and success of treatment will continue to improve.[ADDRESS_865292] been promising with high sustained virologic response (SVR, considered functional cure), widespread uptake of DAA agents in HIV/HCV coinfected patients is  restricted due to unrecognized drug– drug interactions 
between HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART) and DAA agent. In this regard, treatment of HCV in HIV/HCV coinfected patients remains a complex issue.  
 Recently, in -vitro studies have demonstrated that maraviroc, and HIV ART that 
exerts anti -HIV effects through CCR5 antagonism, appears to have significant anti -
viral effect on HCV replication comparable to sofosbuvir –a potent HCV NS5B 
inhibitor and the back bone to several combination anti -HCV DAA therapy cur rently 
approved. In this study, we propose to characterize the antiviral effect of Maraviroc in HIV/HCV coinfected patents naïve to anti -HCV DAA therapy. We intend to 
evaluate HCV viral kinetics after adding maraviroc to existing ART in 10 HIV/HCV coinfect ed patients by [CONTACT_646232]. This study will 
provide the in- vivo evidence that CCR5 antagonists can be used to treat HCV and 
may offer prolonged effect in the HIV/HCV coinfection by [CONTACT_646233].

Page 8 of 30 1 Background Information and Scientific Rationale  
 Epi[INVESTIGATOR_91256] C virus (HCV) is a major cause of chronic liver disease and is the leading 
indication for liver transplantation in the US. Approximately 4.1 million individuals (1.6%) in the US population have been infected with HCV.
6 Approximately 50% of 
HCV infected persons have been tested, with the remainder unaware of their diagnosis. Of t hose that reach care, 16% have been treated, and 9% have been 
cured of HCV.
7 8 Among HIV -positive individuals, coinfection with HCV is relatively 
high, ranging from 15% to 30%.9,10 Liver disease in HIV patients has become a 
major source of morbidity and mortality in the US and worldwide.11 HIV/HCV 
coinfection is especially problematic in the US now that HIV patients are living longer on highly active antiretroviral therapy (ART), and are often dying of 
complications from liver disease primarily related to HCV. In addition, more than 
75% of adults in the US infected with HCV were born between [ADDRESS_865293] ug use (IVU) per capi[INVESTIGATOR_135009] 2004
12. A more 
recent study looking at patterns of drug use and infectious disease in Baltimore drug users found that 45% of recent users of cocaine or heroin were infected with hepatitis C and with nearly 8% co- infected wit h HIV
13.  
 Treatment  
 
Until recently, a major limiting factor in expansion of treatment for HCV has been standard of care therapy with pegylated interferon, ribavirin, and more recent ly for 
genotype [ADDRESS_865294] profiles, response- based dosing regimens of over 6 months, and 
decreased efficacy in key groups including: those with genotype 1 disease, HIV coinfection, and cirrhosis. In particular the response rates observed in HIV/HV 
coinfected patients were much lower than those without HIV infection .

However, with new therapeutics becoming available, the pi[INVESTIGATOR_646225].  There has been dramatic improvement using all oral DAA regimens with sustained virologic response (SVR) rates over 90%, short -duration therapi[INVESTIGATOR_646226] -
tolerated, simple r egimens including among those with HIV coinfection. Although 
the rates of SVR has been relatively high in limited studies that have evaluated these novel DAA regimens in HIV/HCV coinfected patients, it is unclear whether 
MAVERIC  
Jan, [ADDRESS_865295], HIV/HCV coinfected patients have demonstrated a much more rapid pr ogression of liver fibrosis over time. Hence, 
management of HIV/HCV coinfected patients offer several challenges that need to be addressed.  
 Rationale  
CCR5 is a chemokine co- receptor best known for its central role in HIV binding to 
T-cells. However, CCR5 is expressed in hepatocytes, stellate cells and Kupffer 
cells within the liver16 and may mediate liver fibrosis .17-19 Interaction between HIV 
(or gp120) and CCR5 has been shown to upregulate HCV replication as well .[ADDRESS_865296] of CCR5 blockade using two potent 
receptor antagonists, cenicriviroc (dual CCR2/[ADDRESS_865297]) and maraviroc (CCR5 a ntagonist), on HCV replication in- vitro. Both agents  are known to inhibit 
HIV  replication and cenicriviroc is being evaluated  in  a  Phase 2b trial in adults with NASH and  hepatic fibrosis. Briefly, 100,000 Huh7.5
JFH1 human hepatocyte 
cells, which cons titutively produce a cell -line adapted strain of HCV genotype 2 
and express CCR5 were seeded in 24- well format plates. The next day, cells 
were incubated with 25 ug/ml, 0.25 ug/ml, or 0.0025 ug/ml of the antiviral drugs under investigation. These included maraviroc or cenicriviroc, sofosbuvir (an HCV polymerase inhibitor positive control) or raltegravir (an HIV integrase inhibitor negative control). The culture supernatants were collected after 24 hours of incubation with the drug. Cell number was evaluated to determine if cell 
viability affected HCV viral load production. HCV replication was monitored using a commercial HCV Core Antigen ELISA assay (Cell BioLabs, San Diego, CA). Negative strand HCV RNA was detected by a qualitative strand- specific RT -PCR 
assay as a measure of actively replicating virus . Positive strand HCV RNA was 
measured by [CONTACT_16641] -PCR in the cell culture supernatant.  
 
Collectively, CCR5 blockade with cenicriviroc  & maraviroc decreased HCV core 
production, HCV negative strand production and HCV RNA released to 
supernatant to extents comparable with sofosbuvir, a known HCV NS5B inhibitor 
with extremely potent anti -HCV activity in -vitro and in- vivo.
22 The results were 
specific to R5 antagonism since Raltegravir (an HIV integrase inhibitor) did not 
lead to a similar effect on HCV replication. These results led us to believe that 
CCR5 blockade appears to modulate HCV replication in an in -vitro Huh7.5 JFH1 
human hepatocyte cell system. This potent inhibition suggests that CCR5 may 
represent a new target for multidrug HCV therapy and warrants evaluation in HIV/HCV coinfected  patients. In this regard, we intend to study a small group pf 
HIV/HCV infected patients

Figure 1A –  Change in HCV Core Antigen  concentrations  
A dose- dependent response was observed for maraviroc, cenicriviroc, and sofosbuvir at 
the 0.25 ug/ml and 25 ug/ml concentrations but not at 0.0025 ug/ml. Raltegravir had no 
effect on HCV  core antigen production,  nor did DMSO buffer controls. Cell viability was 
not affected by [CONTACT_646234].

and 72C for 2 min) were performed, and PCR  products (295 base pairs in length) were 
visualized by [CONTACT_646236]. GAPDH (400 bp) was amplified as a control.

 Study Drug   
Maraviroc (trade name: [CONTACT_646250]) is an antiretroviral drug in the CCR5 receptor 
antagonist  class used in the treatment of HIV infection. It is also classed as an 
entry inhibitor . Maraviroc was approved for the treatment of HIV infection by [CONTACT_646237] 2007. Specifically, maraviroc is a negative 
allosteric  modulator of the chemokine CCR5  receptor, found on the surface of T 
lymphocytes. The chemokine  receptor CCR5 is an essential co- receptor for most 
HIV strains and necessary for HIV to infect lymphocytes. The drug binds to CCR5 at a non- competitive site and alters gp120 binding site of CCR5, thereby [CONTACT_646238] .

 Research Strategy   
Study subjects will be selected and enrolled at a single si te at IHV. HIV infected 
participants  (coinfected with HCV and DAA -treatment naïve for HCV) who are 
well controlled on ART will receive Maraviroc for one month and serial 
measurements of viral and immune parameters will be performed. Rationale for not recruiting treatment naïve HIV/HCV coinfected participants is based on 
previous studies that have demonstrated an increase in HCV VL in HIV/HCV coinfected patients who initiated ART .
[ADDRESS_865301] of CCR5 antagonism.  
Patients with HIV/HCV coinfection with HIV viral suppression and active HCV 
infection will be included. Patients will be randomized to one of 2 cohorts: immediate 
start of marav iroc (cohort 1), and delayed start (cohort 2). All patients will receive 4 
weeks of Maraviroc (dose adjusted according to intake of concurrent CYP 3A 
inducers, see table 1) in addition to their regular ART. The immediate start group will 
receive maraviroc in addition to their HIV antiretroviral regimen from week 0 to 4. 
This will be followed by a wash out period of 4 weeks after cessation of Maraviroc. After the 4- week wash out period, patients will be crossed over the no- maraviroc 
arm. The delayed start gr oup will receive no maraviroc from weeks 0 to 4, followed 
by a 4 week wash out period, before crossing over to the on- maraviroc arm. Figure 2 
below illustrates the study scheme.

• Medication review  
 
At study visits every [ADDRESS_865309] study visit the following blood 
specimens may be collected for research laboratory storage and tests (total 
68.5 ml research, or about 4 .6 tablespoons):  
• RNA paxgene (2.5ml)  
• Peripheral blood mononuclear cell (50 ml)  
• Serum storage (10 ml) 
• Plasma storage (6ml)  
 
Outside Tests:   Tissue may be requested from liver biopsies done for clinical 
purposes; imaging, FibroScan or other liver evaluation results may also be 
requested from outside providers with subject consent.  
 HCV and HIV Virologic Studies  
We will study the viral and host immunity to HCV and HIV in all patients. The results will be used to characterize each individual with regards to immune status and chronicity of disease.  
A] Full length HCV genome sequencing will be performed on plasma using the protocol as described and compared for variability of sequences.  
B] Genome -wide transcriptional profiling Sequencing will be performed using 
RNAseq approach. This will provide the most comprehensive coverage of the genome, inc luding empi[INVESTIGATOR_646227], 
MAVERIC  
Jan, [ADDRESS_865310] that are highly representative 
of the analysis group for validation.   
   
We will screen patient samples for miRNA panel that comprises of over 400 known, well -characterized miRNAs. The TaqMan Array Human MicroRNA Panel 
(Applied Biosystems, Inc .) is a fixed -set microfluidic card that simplifies the 
profiling of 400plus human miRNAs. After extracting RNA and making cDNA we will use the Multiplex RT and TaqMan MicroRNA Reverse Transcription Kit loaded on the micro- fluidic card, and run on the Appl ied Biosystems7900HT Fast 
Real-Time PCR System.  
C] We will screen sera from all patients for differential expression of protein peaks that may be associated with liver fibrosis and HCC with the aid of a high-throughput approach using multiplex cytokine arr ays, which has the capability of 
detecting several different cytokines and other biologically relevant proteins.  
D] We will perform detailed phenotypic and functional evaluation of immune cell types in the periphery and liver (as available). This will help us in determining the nature of immune responses in patients who are chronically infected. Determination of specific immune defects in these individuals are important milestones in deciding future therapeutics. Exhaustion and activation markers on T, B and NK cells will be quantified. Specific immune responses against pooled 
HBV and HCV peptides will be performed using an ELISPOT assay and flow cytometry as previously described.    
 
7 Potential Risks and Benefits  
 Potential Risks  
The potential risks incl udes risks of phlebotomy which include: pain, bruising, 
fainting and very rarely, infection. These risks will be minimized by [CONTACT_646240].  
 There is potential for loss of confidentiality, which will be minimized by [CONTACT_646241]. In addition, all laboratory specimens, and research records will be coded by a number to maintain subject confidentiality. All paper records will be kept locked with limited access. Electronic data will be password protected and will not include participant names or contact [CONTACT_8972].  
 Risks with Use of Maraviroc  (MVC, Selzentry
™) 
 Common side effects reported with maraviroc that may or may not be causally 
related include: cough, fever, colds/upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_6014], r ash, 
MAVERIC  
Jan, [ADDRESS_865311] abnormalities in patients on maraviroc 
compared to placebo groups.   Postural hypotension was reported in patients taking higher doses (than currently approved) of maraviroc in clinical studies.
[ADDRESS_865312]-marketing experience has reported skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 
including Stevens -Johnson syndrome (a severe and sometimes fatal form of skin 
rash).  
 Maraviroc contains soya lecithin. Therefore if you have a medical history of allergy to soya or peanuts, you may develop an allergy reaction to maraviroc.  
 Potential Benefits  
Participants will derive no direct clinical benefit from participation in this protocol. It is hoped that this research will be of benefit to society by [CONTACT_646242].   
 
8 Store d Samples and Future Research  
Future use of the specimens will be based on the scientific merit of the investigation and would be decided by [CONTACT_079]. They would  be 
related to the study of HCV and/or HIV. Other investigators may wish to s tudy 
these samples and/or data.  In that case, IRB approval must be sought prior to any sharing of samples and/or data.  Any clinical information shared about the sample would similarly require prior IRB approval. If approved, and once a Material Transfer Agreement (MTA) has been established, the study team may 
send de- identified samples to the collaborators.  Investigators will use stored 
samples only for research.  
• Intended Use: Some tissue and blood samples may be stored for future analysis in this resear ch study. These samples will be stored by [CONTACT_646243], the immune system and/or other related medical conditions.  The 
blood and tissue will be used over time to gain a better unders tanding of 
the pathogenesis of HCV and  HIV, and especially the degree of liver 
disease progression.  Genetic testing will be performed. Different analytical and laboratory methods will be employed including but not limited to: PCR, ELISA, ELISPOT and immun ohistochemistry; RNA/DNA, 
MAVERIC  
Jan, 2017  
 
Page 21 of 30 cytokine and antibody quantitation; viral particle detection and 
identification of genetic markers. The consent will include language for specimen storage.  
• Storage:  Samples will be kept in secure facilities with limited access. Samples and data will be stored using a unique identifier.  Only 
investigators and study staff will have access to the samples and data.  
• Tracking:  Extra blood and tissue samples will be stored using a unique 
identifier that only the study team can trace b ack to the participants. These 
stored samples as well as a linkage file will be maintained in a database that will be managed by [CONTACT_7183]/or Study Coordinators and 
will be maintained on the IHV server. This database will also be stored on 
the password- protected computer of the Lead -Investigator/Study 
Coordinator in an encrypted and/or password -coded file.  
• Disposition at the Completion of the Protocol: At the completion of the 
protocol (termination), samples and data will either be destroyed, or  after 
IRB approval, transferred to another existing protocol. Final disposition of any samples cannot be done without written permission from the PI.  
 
• Reporting the Loss or Destruction of Samples/Specimens/Data to the IRB: 
o Any loss or unanticipated destruction of samples or data resulting in a violation that compromises the scientific integrity of the data collected for the study will be reported to the IRB.  
o Participants may request at any point not to have their samples stored. In this case, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_646228]. This decision will not affect the subject’s participation in any other protocols.  
 Generally, the results from the research stored samples will not be given to the participant's primary care provider or appear in the medical record. This is because the test results, unlike routine medical testing, may be experimental or preliminary. The relevance of these tests to direct patient care may be unknown. 
At the participant's request, the results of any research tests will be discussed with the primary care physician by [CONTACT_32366] . 
 
9 Assessment of Safety & Monitoring  
As this is an observational study with i ntervention limited to blood collection, 
safety issues are not expected. Only those reportable Adverse Events (AEs) related to the research procedures will be reported. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_646229] .  
 
MAVERIC  
Jan, 2017  
 
Page 22 of 30 
 Recording/Documentation 
At each contact [CONTACT_10970]  (once a week while taking maraviroc, and then 
every 4 months prior to and after completing maraviroc) , information regarding 
adverse events related to research procedures will be elicited by [CONTACT_646244] a source 
document.  Source documents will include: progress notes, laboratory reports and data collection tools. Source documents will be reviewed in a timely manner by [CONTACT_5051].  
 Definitions  
Adverse Event : Any untoward medical occurrence in a human subject, including 
any abnormal sign, symptom, or disease, temporally associated with the subject’s participation in research, whether or not considered related to the subject’s participation in the research.   
 
Protocol Deviation : Any change, divergence, or departure from the IRB approved 
study procedures in a research protocol. Protocol deviations are designated as serious or non- serious and further characterized as:  
• Those that occur because a member of the research team deviates from the protocol.  
• Those that are identified before they occur, but cannot be prevented.  
• Those that are discovered after they occur  
9.2.[ADDRESS_865313] of the protocol will not be reported t o the 
IRB unless they occur at a rate greater than anticipated by [CONTACT_3476]. Expected adverse events will not be reported to the IRB unless they occur at a rate greater than that known to occur in those having phlebotomy procedures normally. If the ra te of these events exceeds the rate expected by [CONTACT_123894], the events will be classified and reported. Deaths related to the natural history of hepatitis or co- infection will be reported at the time of continuing 
review.  
9.2.2 Annual Reporting to the IRB 
The following items will be reported to the University of Maryland IRB in summary at the time of Continuing Review:  
• Serious adverse events or deaths that are not related to the research 
• All adverse events associated with research including expected AEs  Protocol 
deviations.  This includes AEs related to phlebotomy within 48 hours of procedure.  
• Serious, continuing, and minor non- compliance 
• Any trends or events which in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_646230], 2017  
 
Page 23 of 30 
 Type and Duration of the Follow -up of Subjects after Adverse Events  
All SAEs and non -serious AEs identified in this study will be followed until 
resolution or until the PI [INVESTIGATOR_646231]/SAE has stabilized and no more follow -up 
is required.  This requirement indicates that the follow -up may be required for 
some events after the participant discontinues participation from the study.  
These events will be reported to the IRB annually.  
 Withdrawal of a Subject  
A participant may withdraw from the study at any time.  As part of their duties to 
ensure that research participants are protected, the IRB, IHV, or other 
government agencies may discontinue the study at any time.  Voluntary withdrawal from the protocol may occur at any time at the request of either the participant or the PI.  If a request i s made to withdraw from the protocol, all 
further planned study procedures will be immediately cancelled and further follow- up will be terminated. Samples and data collected prior to this request will 
be stored and used as outlined in the protocol unless a specific request is made 
by [CONTACT_646245]. Data already obtained from the participant’s samples will not be discarded. In addition, participants with poor compliance and/or failure to present for follow -up visits 
may be withdrawn from the study at the discretion of the PI.  
 If a patient becomes pregnant during the course of  the study, the investigator, in 
consultation with the patient, should consider whether the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus of continuing the study therapy. If it is determined that the potential benefit does not outweigh the potential risk to the fetus, the patient should be discontinued from the study.  
 Should a subject develop evidence of HIV virologic breakthrough, or decline in CD4 to less than 200 (if above 200  at baseline) during the study they will be 
evaluated by [CONTACT_646246].  
 Discontinuation of maraviroc will be considered in any patient with signs or 
symptoms of acute hepatitis, in particular if drug- related hypersensitivity is 
suspected or with increased liver transaminases combined with rash or other 
systemic symptoms of potential hypersensitivity (e.g. pruriti c rash, eosinophila or 
elevated IgE).  
 Should a subject be started on anti -HCV therapy while in the study, maraviroc 
will be discon tinued and the subject will be withdrawn from the study.  
 Return of Withdrawn/Removed Subjects  
A participant who has withdrawn may  not return to the study.

12 Ethics/Protection of Human Subjects  
 Informed Consent Process  
Informed consent is a process where information is presented to enable persons to volu ntarily decide whether or not to participate as a research subject. It is an 
on-going conversation between the human research subject and the researchers 
which begins before consent is given and continues until the end of the subject's involvement in the r esearch. Discussions about the research will provide 
MAVERIC

Page 25 of 30 essential information about the study and include: purpose, duration, procedures, 
alternatives, risks and benefits.  Subjects will be given the opportunity to ask questions and have them answered.  
The s ubjects will personally sign and date the informed consent document prior 
to undergoing any research procedures. The subjects may withdraw consent at 
any time throughout the course of the trial.  A copy of the informed consent document will be given to the subjects for their records. Consenting process will 
be documented in the record. The rights and welfare of the subjects will be protected by [CONTACT_646247].

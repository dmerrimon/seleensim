LY2951742Summary of Study Design :  
Study CGAJ is a multisite , randomized, open -label trial w ith 3 study  periods in patients diagnosed with epi[INVESTIGATOR_839890] 120 mg /month (with a 240 mg loading dose administered as two 
injections of 120 mg each ) or 240 mg/month of LY2951742 .  Injections of LY2951742 should be self -administered .
Treatment Arms and Duration:   
Two treatment arm s: LY2951742 ( 120mg/month , administered as 1 injection ), and LY2951742 (240 mg /month, 
administered as 2 injections of 120 mg ).  Following a 3-to-45-day screening period, eligible patients will be 
randomized to receive one of two fixed dose s ofLY2951742 for up to 12months during an open -label treatment 
phase , followed by a [ADDRESS_1167303] -treatment phase in which patients are no longer receiving LY2951742 .
Number of Patients :
The study  will screen an estimated 312potential study participants and enroll approximately 2 50 patients to ensure 
that 100patients with migraine complete the 12 -month treatment phase .
Statistical Analysis:
Effectiveness and safety a nalyses will be conducted using an intent -
to-treat (ITT) population, which is to include all 
patients who receive at least one dose of investigational product .    
Continuous safety and efficacy variables with repeated measures will be analyzed using mixed-model repeated 
measures (MMRM) which will include the fixed categorical effects of treatment, treatment -by-visit interaction,
pooled investigative site, visit, as well as the continuous fixed covariates of baseline andbaseline -by-visit 
interaction .  When appropriate ,an analy sis of variance (ANOVA) or an analy sis of covariance (ANCOVA )model 
with LOCF imputation will be used .  Baseline value will be the last available value from Visit 1 to Visit 2 .  
Categorical safety and efficacy variables with repeated measures will be analyzed using generalized linear mixed 
model (GLIMMIX) in a similar manner as for mean change sabove. Categorical safety variables without repeated 
measures will be analyzed by [CONTACT_125427] -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test controlling for pooled investigative site 
(Fisher’s exact tests, if needed) .
Subgroup analyses will be conducted for some of the efficacy and safety measures. No interim analyses are planned 
for this study.  However, an interim analysis may be conducted in support of   regulatory  submissions if necessary.

LY29517422.Introduction
2.1. Background
Migraine is a chronic, debilitat ing condit ion found to be one of the top 10causes of disabilit y 
expressed as years lived with disabilit y globally (Vos et al . 2012).  However, one study  estimates 
that only a small fract ion of patients receive prevent ive treatment, although more than 25% of 
migraineurs are in need of prevent ive therapy (Rizzoli 2014).  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_96631] y of 
prevent ive medicat ions for migraine, significant needs remain for new treatm ent opti ons wi th 
improved efficacy and tolerabilit y.
Calcitonin gene -related pepti de(CGRP), a 37 -amino acid neuropeptide , is widely expressed 
throughout the central and peripheral nervous sy stem and acts as a local facilitator of 
inflammatory  processes .  Ca lcitonin gene -related pepti deis implicated in the pathophysio logy of  
migraine and is hypothesized to be invo lved in the release of inflammatory  mediators and the 
transmissio n ofnocicept ive (p ain) informat ion from intracranial  blood vessels to the nervous 
system  (Villal ónand Ol esen 2009). In migraineurs, serum concentrations of CGRP are 
significant ly elevated during migraine attacks (Goadsby  [CONTACT_2297] . 1990; Goadsby  [CONTACT_529987] 
1993), and infus ion of CGRP to individuals wit h a history  of migraine can trigger migraine 
attacks (Lassen et al. 1998, Lassen et al. 2002). The neutraliz ation of CGRP with antibodies has 
been shown to modulate neurogenic inflammat ion; thus, these ant ibodies may represen t a 
promising pharmaco logicapproach for the preventio n of migraine (Investi gator’s Brochure [IB], 
Secti on 3.1).
LY2951742 is a humanized monoclonal ant ibody  that potently  and selectively binds t o CGRP, 
prevent ing CGRP -mediated bio logical effects (IB, Sec tion 3.1).  To date, m ore than [ADDRESS_1167304] been exposed to LY2951742 at single doses ranging fro m 1 to 600 mg and 
multiple doses up to 300 mg in 5 clinical trials of LY2951742.  In studies of pat ients with 
migraine ( Studi es I5Q -MC-ART1 [ART -01] and I5Q -MC-CGAB [CGAB]), efficacy data have 
demonstrated that LY2951742 had significant ly greater mean reduction s than placebo in 
migraine headache days and other efficacy  parameters.  Across clinical studies of LY2951742, 
assessment of adver se events (AEs) indicates that LY2951742 has been well tolerated in both 
healt hy subjects and in pat ients with epi[INVESTIGATOR_39751] c migraine.  The AEs generally  have been mild to 
moderate in severit y. In two studies of pat ients with migraine, the most frequent ly repo rted AEs 
included inject ion
-site pain, upper respi [INVESTIGATOR_39738], abdo minal pain, dizziness, 
inject ion-site ery thema, rash, hypertensio n, and nasopharyngit is.  Analyses of laboratory  values 
and cardio vascular mo nitoring of the clinical studies have shown no other clinically  important 
changes in tested parameters.
2.2. Study Rationale
Study  I5Q-MC-CGAJ (CGAJ) will enable a comprehensive safet y assessment of LY2951742 in 
both epi[INVESTIGATOR_839891] a history  of at least 
4 migraine headache days during a recent 30- day period (Section 5.1)and will build upon 
preliminary evidence of efficacy and safety  from com pleted studi es of LY2951742.  This study  
is intended to provide long-term data that will help support a registration program forpatients

dosin g visi ts (Visi t 2, and Visit 4 through Visi t 14) f or a total  of 12 doses. Patients rando mized 
to 120 mgwill receive an init ial loading dose of 240 mg ([ADDRESS_1167312] ions of 120 m g each) at Visi t 2.  
All injecti ons at subsequent dosing visits will be self-admin istered as a single inject ion of 
120mg.Those randomized to [ADDRESS_1167313] ions will be delivered via prefilled syringe or by  [CONTACT_839894] (when the autoinjector device is available for clinical trial use ).  
Patients (and caregivers) will receive training on the use of the prefilled sy ringe and on the use of 
the autoinjector when switched to the autoinjector.
At Visi t 2(first dose) , the patient mu st rem ain at the study  site for a [ADDRESS_1167314] ions of LY2951742 will 
be administered by  [CONTACT_102] (or caregiver ).  Injecti ons administered by  [CONTACT_839895] 4 
and Visit 5 will be done in the office under the supervisio n of site staff; all subsequent inject ions 
will be administered by  [CONTACT_11346]/caregiver butshoul d be administered unsupervised by [CONTACT_839896].  For all o ffice visits, inject ions will occur after all  study  procedures have been

LY29517424.3. Scientific Rationale for Study Design
The l ength of the open -label treatm ent phase (12 mo nths) is considered an appropriate duration 
to assess the longer -term safety  ofa migraine prevent ion medicat ion and is consistent with 
regul atory  feedback.  A 4-month post -treatm ent follow-up phase is included to evaluate patient 
safet y during wash -out of LY2951742 .  This allows for a total of 5months ofobservat ion from 
the time o f last inject ion of LY2951742.   A 5-month post -treatm ent observat ion peri od allows 
for a wash -out of approximately 5 eliminat ion half -lives of LY2951742 and shoul d decrease 
LY2951742 serum concentrations by [CONTACT_3450] 97% during this time .
4.4. Justificatio nfor Dose 
Doses of 120 mg and 240 m g administered once monthly  were selected primarily on the basis of 
clinical efficacy  and pharmacokinet ic/pharmacodynamic data fro m the Phase [ADDRESS_1167317] ically significant separation 
from placebo as early  as Month 1. Theplanned doses of 120 mg and 2 40 m g LY2951742 for 
Study  CGAJ also are being studied in three pi[INVESTIGATOR_839892]2951742; two of these 
studi es are in pati ents wi th epi[INVESTIGATOR_39751] c migraine, and one is in pat ients with chronic migraine.
4.5. Benefit/Risk Assessment
More informat ion about the known and expected benefits, risks, serious adverse events (SAEs) 
and reasonably ant icipated adverse events (AEs) of LY2951742 are to be found in th e 
Invest igator’s Brochure (IB).
I5Q-MC-CGAJ Clinical Protocol Page [ADDRESS_1167318] ion criteria.  Eligibilit y of patients for study  
enrollment will be based on the results of a screening medical history, physical examinat ion, 
neuro logical examinati on, clinical laboratory  tests, electrocardi ograms ( ECG s), and migraine 
history  during screening, as de scribed in the Inclusio n and Exclusio n Cri teria secti onsof this 
protocol .  The nature of any co morbid condi tions present at the time of the physical examinat ion 
and any  preexist ing condit ions must be documented.   Individuals who do not meet the criteria f or 
participat ion in this study  (screen failure) for specific reasons as outlined maybe considered for 
rescreen ing once, with approval fro m Eli Lilly  and Com pany (Lilly )Medical ( Secti on5.3).

All patients will receive injections of LY2951742 at doses of 120 or 240 mg administered once 
monthlyfor up to 12monthsduring the treatment p hase ( Secti on 4.1; Appendix 2 ).  Patients 
rando mized to the 120 mg dose of LY2951742 will receive an init ial loading dose of 240 mg 
(2inject ions of 120 m g each) at Visit [ADDRESS_1167330], they may  receive assistance from a caregiver (such 
as a family member).  
The invest igator or his/her designee is responsible for the fo llowing:
training patients and caregivers on the care and use of the prefilled sy ringe and the 
investigat ional autoinjector
verifying that instructions are fo llowed properly
maintaining accurate records of investigational product dispensing
at the end of the study  returning all unused medication to Lilly ,or its desi gnee ,

prefilled syringe and, at som e point du ring the study, an autoinjector .  An invest igational 
autoinjector device willbe provi dedduring the study when i t becom es available .
6.2. Method of Treatment Assignment
Patients who m eet all cri teria for enrollment will be randomized to one of two dose groups at
Visit 2.  Assignment to treatment groups w ill be determined by a computer -generated random 
sequence using an interactive web -response system (IWRS).   The IWRS will be used to assi gn
open -label invest igational product to each patient. Site person nel will confirm that they  have 
located the correct ly assigned package by [CONTACT_635331].
To achieve between -group com parabilit y for site factor, the randomizat ion will be stratified by  
[CONTACT_3725].
6.2.1. Selection and Timing of Doses
The actual  time of all dose administrations will be recorded in the pati
ent’s electroni c case report 
form (eCRF).

6.6.1. Special Treatment Considerations 
During the post-treatment follow-up period, pa tients will not receive LY2951742.  One month 
after Visit 15 ([ADDRESS_1167333] dose), if clinically warranted due to a worsening of symptoms, 
patients may start migraine preven tion medications at the discretion of the investigator.  The list 
of allowed preventive medica tions is provided separately. 
6.7. Treatment Compliance 
Investigators will be required  to document the administra tion of LY2951742 in the eCRF. 
LY2951742 must be administered as indicat ed in the Schedule of Activities ( Appendix 2) .  If the 
patient is unable to comply w ith injections in the allowed window, the situation should be 
discussed with Lilly to determine if the patient may continue. 
6.8. Concomitant Therapy 
The list of medications allowed or not allowed during the study can be found in the concomitant 
medications study tool.  The concom itant use of acute medications to treat migraine is allowed, 
with some limitations.  Any changes in the lis t of allowed/not allowed medications will be 
communicated to investigators and will not constitute a protocol amendment. 
I5Q-MC-CGAJ Clinical Protocol Page [ADDRESS_1167334] during open -label treatment (Study  
Period II) will proceed immediately to Study  Period III.
7.1. Discontinuation from Study Treatment
7.1.1. Permanent Discontinuation from Study Treatment
Discontinuati on of  the invest igational product for abnormal liver tests should be considered by

ALP >2.5X ULN and TBL >2X ULN
ALP >2.5X ULN with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vo miting, right quadrant 
pain or tenderness, fever, rash, and/or eosinophilia (>5%)
Patients who discont inue the invest igational product early will have end -of-therapy procedures 
perform ed as shown in the Schedule of Act ivities(Appendix 2 )and are requested to proceed into 
the post -treatment phase .
7.1.2. Temporary Discontinuation from Study Treatment 
Not applicable.
7.1.3. Discontinuation of Inadvertently Enrolled Patients
If the sponsor or invest igator ident ify a pat ient who did not meet enrollment criteria and was 
inadvertent ly enro lled, a discuss ion must occur between the sponsor clinical research 
physician/clinical research scient ist (CRP /CRS )and the investigator to determine if the pat ient 
may cont inue in the study.  If both agree it is medically appropriate to continue, the invest igator 
must obtain documented approval fro m the sponsor CRP /CRS to allow the inadvertent ly enro lled 
patient to co ntinue in the study  with or wi thout treatm ent wi th invest igational product.
7.1.4. Permanent Discontinuation from the Study
Some possible reasons that may  lead to perm anent di scontinuat ion include:
I5Q-MC-CGAJ Clinical Protocol Page 28
LY2951742Enrollment in any other clinical trial invo lving an investigation al product or enrollment in 
any other ty pe of medical research judged not to be scient ifically or medically co mpat ible 
with this study
Participation in the study  needs to be stopped for medical, safet y, regul atory , or other 
reasons consistent with applicab le laws, regulations, and good clinical pract ice (GCP)
Invest igator Decisio n
othe invest igator decides that the patient should be discontinued from the study
oif the pat ient, for any  reason, requi res treatm ent with another therapeutic agent that 
has been dem onstrated to be effect ive for the study indication (preventi on of  
migraine) during Study  Period II (open -label treatment) ,discont inuat ion from the 
study  occurs pri or to introducti on of  the new agent
Subject Decisio n
othe patient asks to be wi thdrawn from  the study
Patients who discont inue the study early will have end -of-study  procedures perform ed as shown 
in the Schedule of Act ivities(Appendix 2 ) and are requested to proceed into the post- treatm ent 
phase.
7.1.5. Patients Lost to Follow -Up
A pat ient willbe considered lost to fo llow-up if he or she repeatedly  fails to return for scheduled 
visits and is unable to be con tacted by  [CONTACT_4145].  Site personnel are expected to make 
diligent attempts to contact [CONTACT_57986] a scheduled visit or were otherwise 
unable to be fo llowed up by  [CONTACT_4179].

tolerance limit s for timing).
Appendix [ADDRESS_1167336] igator or desi gnated si te 
personnel .In addit ion, the fo llowing s cales will be used for secondary  efficacy  assessments as
summarized below. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Patient Global Impression of Severity
The Pati ent Gl obal Impressio n of Severit y (PGI -S) scale ( Guy 1976) is a pati ent-rated instrument 
that measures baseline illness severit y.  The PGI -S includes a range of possible responses, fro m 1 
(“normal, not at all ill”) to 7 (“extremely ill”).
[IP_ADDRESS]. Patient Global Impression o f Improvement
The Pati ent Gl obal Impressi on of Improvement (PGI -I) scale ( Guy 1976) i s a patient -rated
instrum ent that m easures the improvement of the patient’s symptoms.  It is a 7 -point scale in 
which a score of 1 indicates that the patient is “very  muchbetter ,” a score of 4 indicates that the 
patient has experienced “no change,” and a score of 7 indicates that the patient is “very  much 
worse.”
8.1.3. Appropriateness of Assessments
All efficacy and safet y assessments have been well documented and are generally  regarded as
reliable, accurate, and relevant in this pat ient population .  Thi s includes healt h outcom es 
measures considered to be appropriate for evaluat ing changes in qualit y of life, global 
funct ioning, and disabilit y (Section 8.9).
I5Q-MC-CGAJ Clinical Protocol Page [ADDRESS_1167337] via eCRF the occurrence and nature of 
each patient’s pre-exist ing condit ion(s), including clinically significant signs and symptoms of 
the disease under treatment in the study .  In addi tion, si te personnel will record via eCRF any 
change in the condit ion(s)and any  new condi tion(s)asAEs. Invest igators should record their 
assessment of the potential relatedness of each AE to protocol procedure orinvest igational 
product via eCRF .
The invest igator will decide whether he or she interprets the observed AEs as reasonably 
possibly  related to migraine headache, to the investigat ional product, investigational study  
device, study  procedure, or other concomitant treatment or pathologies.
The invest igator will answer y es/no when making this assessment.
Planned surg eries and nonsurgical intervent ions should not be reported as AEs unless the 
underlying medical condit ion has worsened during the course of the study .
If a patient’s investigational product is discontinued as a result of an AE, study  site personnel  
must re port this to Lilly or its designee via eCRF , clarifying if possible, the circumstances 
leading to discontinuati onsof treatm ent.
8.2.1. Serious Adverse Events
An SAE is any  AE from this study  that resul ts in one of the fo llowing outcom es:
death
initial or prolonged inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3094]
a life -threatening experience (that is, immediate risk of dying)
persistent or significant disabilit y/incapacit y
I5Q-MC-CGAJ Clinical Protocol Page 31
LY2951742congenital ano maly/birth defect
considered significant by  [CONTACT_92355]:  important medical 
events that may  not resul t in death, be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_298945], based upon appropriate medical judgment.
when a condit ion related to the invest igational device ( for example, prefilled 
syringeor auto injector ) necessitates medical or surgical intervent ion to precl ude 
either perm anent impai rment of  a body  function or permanent damage to a body  
structure, the seri ous outcom e of “requi red intervent ion” will be assigned.
Although all AEs after signing the ICF are recorded in the eCRF, SAE reporti ng begins after the 
patient has signed the ICF and has received investigational product.  However, if an SAE occurs 
after si gning the ICF, but prior to receiving investigational product, it needs to be reported 
ONLY if it is considered reasonably possibly related to study  procedure.
Study  site personnel  must al ert Lilly or i ts desi gnee of  any SAE within [ADDRESS_1167338] igator 
awareness o f the event via a sponsor -approved method.  If alerts are issued via telephone, they 
are to be immediately fo llowed wi th official  notificati on on study -specific SAE forms.  This 24 -
hour notificat ion requirement refers to the init ial SAE informat ion and all fo llow -up SAE 
inform ation.
Pregnancy (during maternal or paternal exposure to invest igational product) does not meet the 
definit ion of an AE.  However, to fulfill regulatory requirements ,any pregnancy that occurs 
during the study , including those in which conceptio n occurred within [ADDRESS_1167339] 
discontinued and/or completed the study  (the patientsummar y eCRF has been com pleted).  
However, if the invest igator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a patienthas 
been discharged from the study , and he/she considers the event reasonably  possibly  related to the 
study  treatm ent or study  participat ion, the invest igator m ust prom ptly notify Lilly .
[IP_ADDRESS]. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions
Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) are serious events that are not listed 
in the IB and that the investigator ident ifies as relat ed to investigational product or procedure.  
[LOCATION_002] [ADDRESS_1167340] ive 2001/20/EC and the 
associ ated detailed guidances or nati onal regulatory  requirements in parti cipat ing countries 
requi re the reporting of S[LOCATION_003]Rs . Lilly has procedures that will be fo llowed for the recording 
and expedited reporting of S[LOCATION_003]Rs that are consistent with glo bal regulat ions and the associated 
detailed guidances.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Event Monitoring with a Systematic Questionnaire 
Suicidali tywill be assessed as requi red by [CONTACT_3133]’s Divisio n of 
Neurol ogy for use in clinical trials invo lving all drugs for neurological indicat ions.  Before 
administering the C-SSRS (Posner et al. 2011 ), study  site personnel  will quest ion the patient 
I5Q-MC-CGAJ Clinical Protocol Page [ADDRESS_1167341] ing condit ion(s) and the occurrence and nature of any AEs.  
Nonserious AEs obtained through the questionnaire are recorded and analyzed separately. Only 
serious AEs and AEs leading to discont inuat ion elici ted through the C -SSRS are to be recorded 
as AEs via eCRF. Serious adverse events must be reported to Lilly  or its designee wi thin 
24hours as SAEs.   Any suicidal behavior, or suicidal ideat ion per items 4 or 5 (active suicidal 
ideat ion with som e intent to act, either without specific plan or with specific plan and intent) 
woul d prom pt ref erral of the pati ent to a m ental  health prof essional.
8.2.2. Complaint Handling
Lilly co llects product complaints on invest igational products and drug delivery systems used in 
clinical studies in order to ensure the safet y of study  parti cipants, m onitor quali ty, and to 
facilitate process and product improvements.
Patients will  be instructed to contact [CONTACT_81129] a 
complaint or probl em wi th the invest igational product (or drug delivery  system such as a 
prefilled syringe orautoinjector ) so that the situation can be assessed.
8.3. Treatment of Overdose
No data are available at this stage of development.
8.4. Safety Assessments
8.4.1. Electrocardiograms
For each patient, a single, 12 -lead digital ECG willbe collected at the visits shown in the 
Schedule of Activities(Appendix 2 ). Electrocardi ogram s will have a central overread and 
shoul d be recorded according to the study -specific recommendat ionsincluded in an ECG
manual.   
Any clinically  significant findings from ECGs that result in a diagnosis should be reported to 
Lilly or i ts desi gnee as an AE viaeCRF .
8.4.2. Vital Signs
Vital signs will  include body  temperature, bl ood pressure, and pulse.  Blood pressure and pulse 
will be measured in triplicate in the sitt ing posit ion prior to bl ood draws and study drug 
administration (seeStudy  Schedule [ Appendix 2 ]).
Any clinically  significant findings from vital signs measurement that result in a diagnosis should 
be reported to Lilly or its designe e as an AE viaeCRF .
8.4.3. Laboratory Tests
For each patient, laboratory testsdetailed in Appendix 3 shoul d be conducted accordi ng to the 
Schedule of Activities (Appendix 2 ). 
Any clin ically  significant findings from laboratory tests that resul t in a di agnosis shoul d be 
reported to Lilly  or its designee as an AE via eCRF .
I5Q-MC-CGAJ Clinical Protocol Page 33
LY2951742In addit ion, an immunogenicit y plasma sample will be collected, when possible, for any  patient 
who experiences a potenti al systemic allergic/hypersensit ivity react ion during the study  as 
judged by  [CONTACT_3170]. This immunogenicit y plasma sample shoul d be co llected 
immediately  or as soon as possible, taking into consideration the availabilit y and wellbeing o f 
thepatient. Exact date and time of the sample should be recorded on the laboratory requisit ion 
form.
8.4.4. Other Tests 
Not applicable.
8.4.5. Safety Monitoring
Invest igators are responsible for monitoring individual pat ient safety  throughout the tri al.If a 
study  patient/subject experiences elevated ALT ≥3X ULN, ALP ≥2X ULN, or elevated TBL 
≥2X ULN, clinical and laboratory  monitoring should be init iated by  [CONTACT_3170]. Details for 
hepat ic monitoring depend upon the severit y and persistence of observed laboratory test 
abnorm alities.To ensure patient/subject safet y and com ply wit h regulatory  guidance, the 
investigator is to consult with the Lilly CRP/CRS regarding collect ion of specific reco mmended 
clinical informat ion and fo llow-up laboratory  tests. See Appendix 4 .
Lilly will periodically  review evolving aggregate safet y data wi thin the study . In addit ion, safet y 
data for the trial will also be reviewed periodically  by [CONTACT_105231] ( DMC; an advisory  group for the LY2951742 clinical development program) .
8.5. Pharmacokinetics
At the visit s and t imes specified in the Schedule of Act ivities (Appendix 2 ), venous blood
samples of approximately 2.[ADDRESS_1167342] dose administration prior to blood 
sampling should be recorded .  The actual date and time (24-hour clock time )of each sampling 
will be recorded.   Bioanaly tical samples collected to measure invest igational product 
concentration will be re tained for a maximum of [ADDRESS_1167343] ivities (Appendix 2 ), venous blood 
samples will be co llected to determine the plasma concentrations of CGRP.  A maximum o f 
3samples m ay be collected at addit ional time points during the study if warranted and a greed 
upon between both the investigator and sponsor.  Instructions for the collection and handling o f 
blood sam ples will  be provi ded by [CONTACT_456].  When a blood sample is collected , the time and 
I5Q-MC-CGAJ Clinical Protocol Page [ADDRESS_1167344] dose administration prior to blood sampling s hould be recorded .  The actual date and 
time (24-hour clock time )of each sampling will be recorded.
A validated assay will be used to determine plasma drug- tolerant CGRP concentrations.  
Samples will  be analyzed at a l aboratory  approved by  [CONTACT_456].
Bioanalyt ical samples collected to m easure CGRP will be ident ified by [CONTACT_92361] 
(coded) and retained for a maximum o f [ADDRESS_1167345] ivities (Appendix 2 ),where local regulat ions and ERBs allow.
Samples will  be used for research on the drug target, disease proce ss, pathways associated with 
migraine headache and/or other pain condit ions, mechanism  of action of LY2951742, and/or 
research method or in validat ing diagnost ic tools or assay(s) related to migraine headache and/or 
other pain condit ions.  
CCI
I5Q-MC-CGAJ Clinical Protocol Page [ADDRESS_1167346] LY2951742 as specified in the Schedule of 
Activities (Appendix 2 ).Immunogenicit y will be assessed by a validated assay designed to 
detect anti -drug ant ibodies in the presence o f the investigational product.  Ant ibodies may be 
further characterized and/or evaluated for their abilit y to neutralize the activ ity of LY2951742.
Samples will  be retained for a m aximum  of [ADDRESS_1167347] patient visit for the study , or 
for a shorter peri od if regulat ions and ERBs impose shorter time limits, at a facilit y selected by  
[CONTACT_456].  The duration allows the spo nsor to respond to future regulatory requests related to 
LY2951742.
8.9. Health Economics
The self -reported questionnaires will be administered according to the Schedule o f Activities
(Appendix 2 ).  Health economic, disabilit y and quali tyof life assessments of LY2951742 in 
patients wi th migraine will be based on the following scales:
Migraine Disability Assessment test (M IDAS ): The MIDAS was designed to quantify 
headache -related di sabili ty over a [ADDRESS_1167348] the number of days reported as missing, or with reduced productivit y at work or hom e and 
social events, are wei ghted to p roduce scores in which a higher value is indicat ive of more 
disabili ty (Stewart 1999 ;Stewart 2001 ).  This instrument is considered highly reliable and valid; 
and is correlated with clinical judgment regarding the need for medical care (Stewart 1999 ;
Stewa rt 2001) . 
Migraine Specific Quality of Life questionnaire (MSQ v2.1): The MSQ v2.1 i s a self-
administered healt h status instrument, and was developed to address physical and emotional 
limitations of specific concern to individuals suffering fro m migraine headaches. The instrument 
consists of 14 items that address 3 dom ains: (1) Role Functi on-Restrictive ;(2) Rol eFuncti on-
Preventive; and, (3) Emotional Funct ion (Jhingran 1998) .  The instrument was designed with a 4 -
week recall period, and is considered r eliable, valid and sensit ive to change in migraine ( Jhingran 
1998; Rendas -Baum 2013 ). Clinically meaningful differences for each domain have been 
established and are widely used in the literature.
I5Q-MC-CGAJ Clinical Protocol Page 36
LY2951742Patient Satisfaction with Medication Questionnaire Modifi ed(PSMQ -M):The PSMQ -Mis 
a self-rated scale which measures patient s’level of satisfact ion withstudy  medicat ion(Kalali
1999 ). The scale has been modified for use in this study , assessing [ADDRESS_1167349] 4 weeks: satisfact ion, preference, and side effects. Satisfact ion 
responses range fro m “very unsat isfied” to “very  satisfied” wi th the current treatment. 
Preference compares the current study  medicat ion to previ ous m edicat ions, wi th responses fro m 
“much rather prefer my previ ous medicat ion” to “much rather prefer themedicationadministered 
to me during the study .”
Health Care Resource Utilization (HCRU) and Employment Status :The HCRU will be 
solicit ed by  [CONTACT_839898]. The HCRU consists o f [ADDRESS_1167350] ion on employment status is also solicited, given the correlat ion and potential 
confoundi ng wi th health outcom es measures . 
Subcut aneous Administration Assessment Questionnaire (SQAAQ ):  The SQAAQ is a self-
administered questionnaire that provides an assessment of ease of use and confidence wit h using 
a device to administer a subcutaneous inject ion of investigat ional product .  Patien ts will respond 
to questi onnaire i tems using a 7 -point Li kert scal e (fro m “Strongly Disagree” to “Strongly 
Agree”) shortly after the injection . If a caregiver administer sthe injection, the patient should be 
prepared to provide the caregiver’s ratings of the questions.
I5Q-MC-CGAJ Clinical Protocol Page [ADDRESS_1167351] ical analysis plan (SAP) document.
Unless otherwise specified, safety and effect iveness analyses will be conducted on an intent -to-
treat (ITT) basis, which is to include all pat ientswho receive at least one dose of invest igational 
product. When change from baseline is assessed, the pat ient will be included in the analysis only 
if he/she has a baseline and a post -baseline measurement.
All statistical tests will be conducted at a 2 -sided alpha level o f 0.05, and 95% confidence 
intervals will be provi ded if appropri ate, unless otherwise stated. No adjust ments for multiplicity 
willbe applied to any  safet y or efficacy  analyses.
Continuous safety  and efficacy  variables with repeated m easures will be analyzed using mixed-
model repeated m easures (MMRM) which will include the fixed categorical effects of treatm ent, 
treatm ent-by-visit interaction, pooled investi gative site, visit, as well as the continuous fixed 
covari ates of baseline and baseline -by-visit interacti on.
The safet yand efficacy analys es will  be conducted for Study  Period IIandStudy Period III
(post-treatment follow -up phase ), as well as the two periods combined.
When appropriate ,an analysis of variance (ANOVA) or an analysis of covariance ( ANCOVA )
model with last-observat ion-carried -forward ( LOCF )imputation will be used.  Unless otherwise 
specified, when an ANOVA modelis used to analyze a cont inuous variable, the model will 
contain the main effect of treatm entand pooled investigative site. When an ANCOVA model is 
used to analyze change fro m baseline for a continuous variable, the model will include treatm ent,
baseline ,and pooled investigative site.
Categorical variables wit h repeated measures will be summarized and analyzed in a similar 
manner as for mean change sfrom a categorical, pseudo li kelihood -based repeated measures 
analysis using a generalized linear mixed model ( GLIMMIX ) procedure in SAS. Categorical 
variables wit hout repeated measures will be analyzed by [CONTACT_125427] -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test 
controlling for pooled invest igative site (Fisher ’s exact tests, if needed). 
Any change to the data analysis methods described in the protocol will require an amendment 
ONLY if it changes a principal feature of the p rotocol .  Any  other change to the data analysis 
methods described in the protocol, and the just ification for making the change, will be described 
in the clinical study  report (CSR) .  Additional exploratory analyses of the data will be conducted 
as deemed a ppropri ate.

Term Definition
AE adverse event:  Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
subject administered a pharmaceutical product that does not necessarily have a causal 
relatio nship with this treatment.  An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease 
temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or 
not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.
complaint A complaint is any written, electronic, or oral communication that alleges deficiencies 
related to the identity, quality, pu rity, durability , reliability , safety  or effectiveness, or 
performance of a drug or drug delivery system.
enroll The act of assigning a patient to a treatment.  Patients who are enrolled in the trial are 
those who have been assigned to a treatment.
enter Patients entered into a trial are those who sign the informed consent form .
interim analysis An interim analysis is an analysis of clinical study data, separated into treatment groups, 
that is conducted before the final reporting database is created/lock ed.
investigational 
productApharmaceutical form of an active ingredient or placebo being tested or used as a 
reference in a clinical trial , including products already on the market when used or 
assembled (formulated or packaged) in a way different from the authorized form, or 
marketed products used for an unauthorized indication, or marketed products used to 
gain further information about the authorized form.
ITT intent to treat : The principle that asserts that the effect of a treatment policy can be best 
assessed by [CONTACT_56620] o n the basis of the intention to treat a patient (that is, the planned 
treatment regimen) rather than the actual treatment given.  It has the consequence t hat 
patients allocated to a treatment group should be followed up, assessed ,and analyzed as 
members of that group irrespective of their compliance to the planned course of 
treatment.
IWRS interactive web -response sy stem
SAE serious adverse event
TEAE treatment -emergent adverse event : Any untoward medical occurrence that either occurs 
or worsens at any time after treatment baseline and thatdoes not necessarily have to 
have a causal relationship with this treatment .

Note: S elected tests may be obtained in the event of a treatment -emergent hepatic abnormality and may be required in follow- up with patients in consultation with the Lilly, or its designee, cli nical 
research physician .  If the patient has discontinued the trial and returns for hepatic follow -up, the site should use the [ADDRESS_1167359] include a neurological exam.
cElectrocardiograms ( ECG s)will be performed at Visit 1, Visit 2, Visit 9, Visit 15 and Visit 17 or early termination .  Note:  the Visit 2ECG should be co llected prior to blood draws and dosing.  
Patients must be supi[INVESTIGATOR_17044] [ADDRESS_1167360] 30 minutes in the office.
Injections administered by [CONTACT_309506] 4 and Visit 5 will be done in the office under the supervision of the staff; all subsequent injections will be administered by [CONTACT_102]/caregiver and 
should be unsupervised by [CONTACT_49885].
fFastin g laboratory samples (such as chemistry) will be collected at baseline (Visit 2), 6 months (Visit 9), and study endpoint (Visit 15 or early study termination ).  Fasting status is defined as no food 
or caloric beverage [ADDRESS_1167361] for confirmation. Patients will be provided with a home pregnancy kit for testing (prior to injection) at each home visit.

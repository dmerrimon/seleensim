Final Protocol 09 June 2020
Main Criteria for Evaluation and Analyses:
Primary  Endpoints
The following PK parameters will be analyzed for TAK -788.
Time of first occurre nce of C max(Tmax).
Maximum observed concentration (C max).
Area under the concentration -time curve from time [ADDRESS_702855] 
quantifiable concentration (AUC ).
Area under the concentration -time curve from time [ADDRESS_702856] quantifiable concentration (AUC last). 
Secondary Endpoints
The following PK parameters will be analyzed for active metabolites (AP32960 and AP32914) of TAK -788.
Time of first occurrence of C max(Tmax).
Maximum observed concentration (C max).
Area under the concentration -time curve from time [ADDRESS_702857] 
quantifiable concentration (AUC ).
Area under the concentration -time curve from time [ADDRESS_702858] quantifiab le concentration (AUC last).
Explo ratory  Safety  Endpoints
Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_47364] (TEAEs), clinical laboratory values, 
physical examinations, 12-lead ECGs, and vital signs
Statistical Considerations:
Pharmacokinetics:
The PK parameters of TAK -788 and its active metabolites (AP32960 and AP32914) will be calculated based on 
plasma concentration -time profiles of TAK -788 and its active metabolites (AP32960 and AP32914) as described in 
Section 11.0, and outlined in the SAP.
A linear mixed-effects model will be used for the analysis on the natural log (ln) -transformed C max, AUC , and AUC last
for TAK -788 and its active metabolites (AP32960 and AP32914). The model will include sequence, treatment, and 
period as a fixed -effect and subject nested within sequence as a random -effect. Each model will include calculation of 
least squares means (LSMs) as well as the difference between treatment LSMs.
Geometric mean ratios (GMR) and 90% confidence intervals (CI), consistent with the two one sided test [ Schuirmann 
1987], will be calculated using the exponentiation of the difference between treatment LSMs from the analyses on the 
ln-
transformed C max, AUC , and AUC last(if it is needed) for TAK -788 and the combined molar C max, AUC , and 
AUC last(if it is needed) for TAK -[ADDRESS_702859] 
treatment relative to the appr opriate reference treatment. 
Safety:
Quantitative safety data as well as the difference to baseline, when appropriate, will be summarized using the 
appropriate descriptive statistics.
Sample Size Justificatio n: 
The sample size calculation was based on the expected 2 -sided 90% CI for th e difference in the paired, 
log-transformed AUC ∞means of TAK -788 in the presence and absence of a high-fat meal. The within -patient 
coefficient of variation for TAK -788 C maxwas estimated to be 17.2% on the basis of data from a clinical study 
conducted in healthy subjects (TAK -788-1001). If the observed GMR for the TAK -788 AUC in the prese nce and 
absence of high -fat is 1, with a sample size of 12, the 90% CI for the AUC GMR is expected to be 0.881 to 1.13 on the 
basis of the variance assumptions. Fourteen (14) healthy  adult subjects will be enrolled into th is high - fat meal effect 
study to get at least 12 PK -evaluable subjects in each treatment arm according to the FDA guidan ce Assessing the 
Effects of Food on Drugs in INDs and NDAs –Clinical Pharmacology Considerations Guidance for Industry 
(FDA FE2019).

4.0 INTRODUCTION
4.1 Background
Aberrant activat ion of epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] (EGFR) and human epi[INVESTIGATOR_47339] 2 (HER2) plays a causal ro le in a subset of non –small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and other 
cancers. As inhibit ion of wild -type (WT) EGFR i s associ ated wi th dose -limit ing toxicit ies, a 
tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that inhibits oncogenic EGFR and HER2 vari ants m ore potently  
than WT EGFR is more likely to be dosed at the more efficacious levels. Mult iple classes of 
activat ing mutations have been i dentified in EGFR and HER2 that vary widely in their sensit ivity 
to available TKIs. TAK -788, form erly known as AP [ZIP_CODE], was designed to be a potent, select ive 
inhibitor of all activated forms of EGFR and HER2, including exon 20 insertions (not targeted by  
[CONTACT_47366]), more potently than it inhibit s WT EGFR.
Clinical Pharmacokinetics
The clinical development pro gram for TAK -788 incl udes an ongoing phase 1/2 clinical efficacy  
and safet y study  in pat ients with NSCLC (AP32788 -
15-101), 2 complete dclinical pharmaco logy 
studies:1) Single rising dose study  (Part 1), low -fat meal effect study  (Part 2), and relat ive 
bioavailabilit y study  (Part 3) in healthy subjects (TAK -788-1001) and 2) a drug -drug i nteracti on 
study to characteri ze TAK -788 drug -drug interaction with eit her a strong cy tochrom e P-
450 
(CYP)3A inhibitor, itraconazole (Part 1) or with a strong CYP3A inducer, rifampin (Part 2) in 
healt hy subjects (TAK -788-1006); and 4 ongoing clinical pharmaco logy studi es: TAK - 788-1002, 
-1004, -1007, and - 1008. The obj ectives and study design of the se studi es are presented in 
TAK -788 IB Edition4(
IB 2020) .Only preliminary PKresul ts from AP32788 -15-101, and final 
PK results fro m TAK -
788-1001 and TAK - 788-1006 are presented in this document.
In the AP32788 -15-101 study , following daily  oral (PO) administrati on of  TAK - 788 once daily 
(QD), TAK -788 was re adily absorbed with a median time to reach C maxconcentrati on (T max) of 
4hours postdose .The single- dose C maxand AUC 24of TAK -[ADDRESS_702867] TAK -788 accumulat ion rati os were observed at steady  state 
(geom etric m ean range 1.2 3to 1.5 2) in the dose range of [ADDRESS_702868] ion of CYP3A and other co -regula ted enzymes/transporters by  [CONTACT_4129] -788 as a potential

evaluated in clinical studies. Sy stemic exposures to metabolites AP32960 and AP32914 in terms 
of molar AUC 24were approximately 62% (%CV: 25%) and 8% (%CV: 13%) of parent AUC [ADDRESS_702869] study  TAK -788-1001, a l ow-fat meal (i e, ≤350 calori es and ≤15% calories 
from fat) did not affect the PK of TAK- 788 in healthy  subjects. At 160 mg TAK -788, 90% CIs of 
the GMR with a low -fat m eal versus fasted conditions for C max(GMR 0.964) and AUC (GMR 
0.951) fell completely wit hin 80 -125% range.
In the TAK -788- 1006 study , a DDI between the CYP3A4 inhibitor, itraconazo le, and TAK - 788 
was observed. Fo llowing coadministrati on of  multiple oral  doses of 200 m g itraconazole wi th a

The clinical safet y data from study AP32788 -15-101 available as o f 27 January 2020 indicated no 
particular safety  findings that are uni que to TAK -788 com pared wi th other approved EGFR TKIs 
for NSCLC patients. The m ostcommo n TEAEs occurring in ≥20% of NSCLC pat ients by 
[CONTACT_11702] (PT) overall were diarrhea 84.7%, nausea 45.3%, decreased appetite 31.0%, 
vomiting31.0%, fat igue 30.0%, and an emia ( 23.2%) . There is so me var iety in t he characterizat ion 
of TEAEs of the skin result ingin different PTs to describe it. The most commo n skin -related PTs 
were rash (3

derm atitis acneiform (12.3%), and pruritus (10.8%) (IB 2020 ).

TAK -[ADDRESS_702873] health benefit to the healthy subjects en rolled in this study  is the free m edical tests 
received at screening and during the study .
In Study  TAK -788- 1001 in healthy subjects (n=69) , the most commo n AEs by [CONTACT_6214] ( ≥2 subjects 
overall) were nausea (12.5%), diarrhea (10.0%), headache (7.5%), and abdo minal pain upper 
(5.0%) in Part 1 of study ; and headache (31.3%), nausea (31.3%), abdominal pain upper (18.8%), 
feces soft (12.5%), and flatulence (12.5%) in Part [ADDRESS_702874] in Part 3 of study . All TEAEs recovered or re solved. One Grade ≥3 AE occurred, which 
was lipase increased and was assessed as not related to TAK -788 (120 m g dose, no treatment 
given). One subject permanently discont inued TAK -788 due to an AE of Grade 1 vomit ing. The 
majorit y of TEAEs were gastrointes tinal and were Grade ≤2 in severit y.There were no clinically 
meaningful pulmo nary, renal , hepat ic, or cardiac abnormalit ies during this study

9.3.1 PK Measurements 
[IP_ADDRESS] Plasma PK Measurements
PK parameters from plasma concentrations o f TAK -788 and its metabo lites,AP32960 and 
AP32914 ,will be calculated as fo llows, as appropriate, following oral administration:
AUC last: The area under the concentration versus time curve, from time [ADDRESS_702928]
observed non- zero concentration, as calculated by  [CONTACT_47389].
AUC : The area under the concentration versus time curve, from time 0 
extrapol ated to infinit y. AUC is calculated as AUC lastplus the rati o of the 
last m easurable blood concentration to the eliminatio n rate constant.
AUC %extrap : Percent of AUC extrapol ated, represented as (1 –AUC last/AUC)*100.
CL/F: Apparent total plasma clearance after oral (extravascular) administration,
calculated as Dose/AUC (TAK -788 only).
Cmax: Maximum observed concentration.
tmax: Time to reach C max. If the m aximum  value occurs at m ore than one time 
point, t maxis defined as the first time po int with this value.
t½z: Apparent first -order terminal disposi tion phase half -life will be calculated as 
0.693/λ z.
λz: Apparent first order terminal disposit ion phase rate constant calculated fro m 
a semilog plot of the plasma concentration versus time curve.
Vz/F : Apparent volume o f distribut ion during the terminal disposit ion phase after 
oral (extravascular) administration, calculated as Dose/(AUC x λ z) 
(TAK -788 only).
No value for λ z, AUC , AUC %extrap , CL/F, Vz/F, or t½zwill be reported for cases that do not exhibit  
a linear terminal log -linear phase in the concentration versus t ime profile. 
No PK parameters will be calculated for subjects with detectable concentrations at 2 or fewer 
consecut ive time po ints. 
Individual and mean plasma concentration -curves (both linear and log- linear) will be included i n 
the final report.

9.3.4 Confinement
In each period, subjects will be housed on Day -1, at the time indicated by [CONTACT_47365], unt il after the 
240-hour PK sample is collected and scheduled safe ty assessments in Period 2 are completed .
Subjects will return for study  assessments/PK blood sampling as indicated in the Section 3.[ADDRESS_702929] all subjects (including subjects who terminate the study  early) 30 ± 2days 
after the l ast TAK -[ADDRESS_702930] who has 
signed inform ed consent to participate in a study; it does not necessarily  have to have a causal 
relationship with the treatment.
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, a clinically significant abnorma l 
laboratory  finding), symptom, or disease temporally  associ ated wi th the use of a drug, whether or 
not it is considered related to the drug.
An untoward finding generally may:
Indicate a new diagnosis or unexpected worsening of a preexist ing condit ion. (Intermittent 
events for pre -exist ing condit ions or underlying disease should not be considered AEs.)
Necessitate therapeutic intervent ion.
Requi re an invasive diagnostic procedure.
Requi re discontinuation or a change in dose of study medicat ion or a concomi tant medicat ion.
Be considered unfavorable by [CONTACT_47392].
Diagnoses versus signs and symptoms:
Each event should be recorded to represent a single  diagnosis. Acco mpanying signs (including 
abnorm al laboratory  values or ECG findings) or symptom s shoul d NOT be recorded as 
additional AEs. If  a diagnosis is unknown, sign(s) or symptom(s) should be recorded 
appropriately  as an AE(s).
Laboratory  values and ECG findings:
Changes in laboratory  values or ECG param eters maybe considered AEs if the y are j udged to 
be clinically  significant (i e, if som e act ion or intervent ion is required or if the Invest igator 
judges the change to be beyo nd the range of normal physio logic fluctuati on). A l aboratory  
re-test and/or continued monitoring of an abnormal va lue are not considered an intervention. In 

TAK -788
Study ID TAK -788-1005 Page 34of 61
Final Protocol 09June 2020
addition, repeated or addit ional noninvasive testing for verificat ion, evaluat ion or m onitoring 
of an abnorm ality is not considered an intervention.
If abnormal laboratory values or ECG findings are the result of pathol ogy for whi ch there is an 
overall diagnosis (eg, increased creat inine in renal failure), the diagnosis only should be 
reported appropriately  as an AE.
Pre-exist ing condit ions:
A pre -exist ing condit ion (present at the time of signing of informed conse nt) is consi dered a 
concurrent medical history  condi tion and shoul d NOT be recorded as an AE. A baseline 
evaluat ion (eg, laboratory  test, ECG, X -ray) should NOT be recorded as an AE unless related 
to a study procedure. However, if the subject experiences a worsening or complicat ion of such 
a concurrent medical history  condi tion, the worsening or complicat ion should be recorded 
appropriately  as an AE (worsening or complicat ion occurs after informed consent is signed). 
Invest igators should ensure that the eve nt term  recorded captures the change in the condit ion 
(eg, “worsening of…”).
If a subject has a pre -exist ing epi[INVESTIGATOR_45283] (eg, asthma, epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]), any occurrence of an 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_55723], seri ous, or 
severe in nature, that is, Investigators should ensure that the AE term recorded captures the 
change from Baseline in the condit ion (eg “worsening of…”).
If a subject has a degenerat ive concurrent condition (eg, cataracts, rheumatoid arthritis), 
worsening of the condit ion should only be captured as an AE if occurring to a greater extent to 
that which would be expected. Again, Invest igators should ensure that the AE term recorded 
captures the change in the condit ion (eg, “worsening of…”).
Worsening o f AEs:
If the subject experiences a worsening or complicatio n of an AE aft er the first administration of 
study  medicat ion or after any  change in study  medicat ion, the worsening or complicat ion 
shoul d be recorded as a new AE. Invest igators should ensure tha t the AE term recorded 
captures the change in the condit ion (eg, “worsening of…”).
Changes in severit y of AEs:
If the subject experiences a change in the severit y of an AE that is not associated with a change 
in study  medicati on, the event shoul d be captur ed once with the maximum severit y recorded.
Prepl anned surgeries or procedures:
Prepl anned procedures (surgeries or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) that were scheduled prior to signing of 
inform ed consent are not considered AEs. However, if a preplanned procedure is performed 
early (eg, as an emergency) due to a worsening of the pre -exist ing condit ion, the worsening o f 
the condi tion shoul d be captured appropriately  as an AE. Com plicati ons resul ting fro m any 
planned surgery  should be reported as AEs.

TAK -[ADDRESS_702931] ive surgeries or proced ures:
Elect ive procedures performed where there is no change in the subject’s medical condit ion 
shoul d not be recorded as AEs but should be documented in the subject’s source documents. 
Com plicat ions result ing from an elect ive surgery should be reported as AEs.
Overdose:
An overdose is defined as a known deliberate or accidental administration of investigational 
drug, to or by  a study  subject, at a dose above that which is assigned to that individual subject 
according to the study protocol. It is up to the Investigator or the reporting physician to decide 
whether a dose is to be considered an overdose, in consultation wit h the Sponsor.
All cases of overdose (with or without associated AEs) will be documented on an Overdose 
page of the CRF, in order to capture this important safet y information consistent ly in the 
database. AEs associated with an overdose will be documented on AE CRF(s) ac cording to 
Secti on 10.0.
Serious adverse events (SAEs) of overdose should be reported according to the procedure 
outlined in Sect ion 10.2.7 .
In the event of drug overdose, the subject should be treated symptomat ically.
10.1.[ADDRESS_702932] medical occurrence that at any  dose:
1.Results in DEATH .
2.Is LIFE THREATENING.
The term “life threatening” refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the 
time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death 
if it were m ore severe.
3.Requi res inpat ient HOSPI[INVESTIGATOR_39749].
4. Results in persistent or significant DISABILITY/INCAPACITY.
5.Is a CONGENITAL ANOMALY/BIRTH DEFECT.
6.Is an IMPORTANT MEDICAL EVENT that satisfies any of the fo llowing:
May require intervent ion to pre vent items 1 through 5 above.
May expose the subject to danger, even though the event is not immediately life 
threatening or fatal or does not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].
AEs that fulfill 1 or more of the serious criteria above are to be considered SAEs and shoul d be 
reported and fo llowed up in the same manner (see Sections 10.1.1 and [IP_ADDRESS] ).

10.2 AE Procedures
10.2.1 Assigning Severity/Intensity of AEs
In thi s study , intensi ty for each AE, including any  laboratory  abnorm ality, will be determined 
using the National Cancer Inst itute, Commo n Termino logy Criteria f or Adverse Events (NCI 
CTCAE), versio n 5.0, dated 27 November 2017 [ CTCAE 2017]. Cl arificati on shoul d be m ade 
between an SAE and an AE that is considered severe in intensit y (Grade 3 or 4) because the terms 
serious and severe are NOT synonymous. The general term severe is often used to describe the 
intensity (severi ty) of a specific event; the event itself, however, may  be of  relatively minor 
medical significance (such as a Grade 3 headache). This is NOT the same as serious , which is 
based on subject/event outcome or action criteria described ab ove and is usually  associated wi th 
events that pose a threat to a subject’s life or abilit y to functi on. A severe AE (Grade 3 or 4) does 
not necessarily need to be considered serious. For example, a white blood cell count of 1000/mm3
to <2000/mm3is consid ered Grade 3 (severe) but may not be considered serious. Seriousness (not 
intensity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory  reporting obligations.

10.2.2 Assigning Causality of AEs
The rel ationship of each AE to study  medicati on(s) will be assessed using the f ollowing 
categori es:
Related: An AE that fo llows a reasonable temporal sequence fro m administration of a 
drug (including the course after withdrawal o f the drug), or for whi ch a causal  
relationship is at least a reasonable possibilit y, ie, the relati onship cannot be 
ruled out , although factors other than the drug, such as underlying diseases, 
complicat ions, conco mitant drugs and concurrent treatments, may also be 
responsible.
Not Rel ated: An AE that does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence fro m ad ministrati on 
of a drug and/or that can reasonably be explained by  [CONTACT_1604], such as 
underlying diseases, complicat ions, conco mitant medi cations and concurrent 
treatm ents.

10.2.[ADDRESS_702936] died.
10.2.5 Action Taken With Study Treatment
Drug withdrawn –a study  medicat ion is stopped due to the particular AE.
Dose not changed –the particular AE did not require stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a study  medicat ion.
Unknown –only to be used if it has not been possible to determine what action has been taken.
Not applicable –a study  medicat ion was stopp ed for a reason other than the particular AE 
eg,the study  has been terminated, the subject died, dosing with study  medicat ion had not y et 
started or dosing wit h study  medicat ion was already  stopped before the onset of the AE.
Drug interrupted –the dose w as interrupted due to the particular AE.
10.2.6 Outcome 
Recovered/reso lved – subject returned to first assessment status with respect to the AE.

TAK -788
Study ID TAK -788-1005 Page 38of 61
Final Protocol 09June 2020
Recovering/resolving –the intensit y is lowered by  [CONTACT_45332] m ore stages: the diagnosis has or 
signs/symptom s have alm ost disappeared; the abnormal laboratory  value improved, but has 
not returned to the normal range or to the baseline value; the subject died fro m a cause other 
than the particular AE with the condit ion rem aining “recovering/resolving.”
Not recovered/not resolved –there is no change in the diagnosis, signs or symptoms; the 
intensity of the di agnosis, signs/symptoms or laboratory  value on the l ast day  of the observed 
study peri od has beco me worse than when it started; is an irreversible congenital ano maly;the 
subject died fro m another cause with the particular AE state remaining “Not recovered/not 
resolved.”
Recovered/Resolved with sequelae –the subject recovered fro m an acute AE but was left wit h 
perm anent/si gnificant impairment (eg, recovered from a car diovascular accident but with 
some persisting paresis).
Fatal  –an AE that is considered as the cause of death.
Unknown –the course of the AE cannot be fo llowed up due to hospi [INVESTIGATOR_47350]’s participation in the study .
10.2.[ADDRESS_702937] AEs, and Abnormal LFTs
[IP_ADDRESS] Collection Period
Collect ion of AEs (ie, AEs, SAEs, Special Interest AEs, and Abnormal LFTs) will co mmence at 
the time the subject signs the informed consent. Routine co llection of AEs will cont inue until the 
follow-up phone call 30 ±[ADDRESS_702938] discont inues study 
participat ion. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting AEs
At each study  visit, the Invest igator will assess whether any subject ive AEs have occurred. A 
neutral  quest ion, such as “How have you been feeling since your last visit ?” may be asked. 
Subjects m ay report AEs occurri ng at any  other time during the st udy. Subjects experiencing an 
SAE prior to the first exposure to invest igational product must be monitored un til the symptom s 
subside and any clinically relevant changes in laboratory values have returned to Baseline or there 
is a satisfactory explanat ion for the change. Non -serious AEs that begin prior to the first exposure 
to invest igational product, related or unrelated to the study procedure, need not be fo llowed-up for 
the purposes of the protocol.
All subjects experiencing AEs, whether considered asso ciated with the use of the study medicat ion 
or not, m ust be m onitored until the symptoms subside and any clinically  relevant changes in 
laboratory  values have returned to Baseline or until there is a sat isfactory  explanati on for the 
changes observed. All A Es will  be docum ented in the AE page of the CRF, whether or not the 
Invest igator concludes that the event is related to the drug treatment. The fo llowing informat ion 
will be documented for each event:

11.1.3 PK Analysis
The plasma TAK -788 and itsactivemetabolites (AP32960 and AP32914) concentrations will be 
listed and plotted against sample co llection times . PK parameters derived fro m theplasma 
concentrations of TAK -788 and its active metabolites (AP32960 and AP32914) and sample 
collect ion times will be calculated as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] using appropriate summary 
statist ics to be fully outlined in the SAP.
[IP_ADDRESS] Analysis of Variance
A linear mixed -effects model will be used for the analysis on the ln -transformed C max, AUC , and 
AUC lastfor TAK -[ADDRESS_702947] ive metabo lites (AP32960 and AP32914). The model will include 
sequence, treatm ent, and peri od as a fixed -effect and subject nested within sequence as a

11.2 Determination of Sample Size
The sample size calculat ion was based on the expected 2 -sided 90% CI for the difference in the 
paired, l og-transform ed AUC ∞means of TAK -[ADDRESS_702949] imated to be 17.2% on the 
basis of data fro m a clinical study conducted in healt hy subjects (TAK -788- 1001). If the observed 
GMR for the TAK -788 AUC in the presence and absence of high -fat is 1, with a sampl e size of 12, 
the 90% CI for the AUC GMR is expected to be 0.881 to 1.13 on the basis of the variance 
assumpt ions. Fourteen (14) adult subjects will be enro lled into this high -fat meal effect study to get 
at least 12 PK -evaluable subjects in each treatmen t arm  according to the FDA guidance Assessing

applicable), and subject informat ion sheet (if applicable) describe the planned and permitted uses, 
transfers, and disclo sures of the subject’s personal an d personal healt h informat ion for purposes of 
conducting the study. The informed consent form and the subject informat ion sheet (if applicable) 
further explain the nature of the study, its object ives, and potential risks and benefit s, as well as the 
date i nform ed consent i s given. The informed consent form will detail the requirements of the 
participant and the fact that he or she is free to withdraw at any  time wi thout giving a reason and 
without prej udice to hi s or her further m edical care.
The Investigat or is responsible for the preparation, content, and IRB or IEC approval of the 
inform ed consent form  and, if applicable, the subject authorization form. The informed consent 
form, subject authorizat ion form (if applicable), and subject information sheet (i f applicable) must 
be approved by [CONTACT_47401].
The informed consent form, subject authorizat ion form  (if applicable), and subject informat ion 
sheet (if applicable) must be written in a language fully co mprehensible to the prospective subject. 
It is the responsibilit y of the Invest igator to explain the detailed elements of the informed consent 
form, subject authorizat ion form (if applicable), and subject informat ion sheet (if applicable) to the 
subject. Information should be given in both oral and written form whenever possible and in the 
manner deemed a ppropri ate by  [CONTACT_4186]. In the event the subject is not capable of rendering 
adequate written informed consent, then the subject’s legally  acceptable representative may 
provi de such consent for the subject in accordance with applicable laws and regul ations.

TAK -[ADDRESS_702955]’s legally acceptable representative, must be given ample opportunit y to: 
(1) inquire about details o f the study, and (2) decide whether or not to participate in the study. If the 
subject, or the subject’s legally  accepta ble representative, determines he or she will part icipate in 
the study , then the informed consent form and subject authorizat ion form (if applicable) m ust be 
signed and dated by  [CONTACT_423], or the subject’s legally  acceptable representative, at the time o f 
consent and prior to the subject entering into the study . The subject or the subject’s legally 
acceptable representative should be instructed to sign using their legal names, not nicknames, 
using blue or black ballpo int ink. The Invest igator must also si gn and date the informed consent 
form and subject authorizat ion (if applicable) at th e time of consent and prior to subject entering 
into the study ; however, the Sponsor may allow a designee of the Invest igator to sign to the extent  
permitted by  [CONTACT_1289].
Once signed, the original informed consent form, subject authorization form (if applicable), and 
subject informat ion sheet (if applicable) will be stored in the Investigator’s site file. The 
Invest igator must document the date the subject signs the i nformed consent in the subject’s 
medical record. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_1681], the signed subject authorization for m 
(if applicable), and subject informat ion sheet (if applicable) shall be given to the subject.
All revised informed consent fo rms m ust be reviewed and signed by [CONTACT_39822]’s legally  acceptable representative in the same manner as the original informed 
consent. The date the revised consent was ob tained shoul d be recorded in the subject’s medical 
record, and the subject should receive a copy o f the revised informed consent form.
13.[ADDRESS_702956]’s right to protection 
against invasio n of privacy. Throughout this study , a subject’s source data will only be linked to 
the Sponsor’s clinical study  database or documentation via a unique ident ificat ion number. As 
permitted by [CONTACT_39823], limited subject attributes, such as sex, age, or date 
of birth, and subject init ials may be used to verify the subject and accuracy o f the subject’s unique 
ident ificat ion number.
To comply wit h ICH Guidelines for GCP and to verify co mpliance with this protocol, the Sponsor 
requi res the Invest igator to permit its monitor o r designee’s monitor, representatives from any 
regul atory  authori ty (eg, FDA, Medi cines and Heal thcare products Regul atory  Agency,

 3. Background Information 
 
Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disease affecting multiple organ systems; however, pulmonary disease is the 
cause of the majority of morbidity and mortality .
[ADDRESS_685497] substantially increased the proportion of CF patients surviving into adulthood. In 1986, 70.8% of patients 
with CF were under 18 years of age . Data from  2016 CF Foundation  Patient Registry Annual report  show 
that that the majority of patients currently living with CF are adults (52.7%) and that median survival is 
now well into middle age (47.7 years).
[ADDRESS_685498] P. aeruginosa is less 
than 10% in pediatric patients with CF, but increases steadily in to around 20% in adults age 30- [ADDRESS_685499] demonstrated high inter -patient variabil ity 
in the exposure of formed colistin and inadequate attainment of therapeutic levels in patients with adequate or augment ed renal function.
6,7 The variability between patients in colistin exposure is due to 
variable conversion from colistimethate, which requires removal of f ive pro -drug functional groups, as

Version  2  Date: November [ADDRESS_685500] to patient renal function in clinical practice.
13 The only PK study of polymyxin B in patients  with 
CF included 9 patients with only a median of 2 samples analyzed per patient (31 samples  total).14 
Interestingly, this study did identify a relationship between polymyxin B CL and creatinine clearance; 
however, the validity  and magnitude of this relationship are uncertain given that most of the observed 
effect was due to a single patient. The other patient -specific factor which has traditionally informed the 
dosing of these agents is patient body weight. Population PK studies of colistin from the modern era of use have challenged the traditionally held belief that the clearance and volume of distribution scale with 
patient weight.
6,[ADDRESS_685501] of patient body weight on the clearance of polymyxin B; however, the majority of polymyxin B dosing in clinical practice is still weight -based.
11,12   
 The polymyxins are associated with significant toxicities, namely, nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity, which 
limit their clinical use. Therefore, it is important to assess the relative toxicity of colistin and PMB to ensure 
that shifting use to PMB for its PK advantages does not lead to increased toxicity. The com parative 
nephrotoxic potential of colistin and polymyxin B has been extensively investigated in non -CF 
populations, primarily the critically ill, and a meta- analysis of recent observational studies found an 
increased risk for acute kidney injury (AKI) with colistin relative to polymyxin B (RR 1.55, 95% CI 1.36-
1.78).
[ADDRESS_685502] colistin associated AKI (aOR 0.03, 95% CI 0.001 -0.79) in multivariable analysis.
17 Unfortunately, 
no CF patients in this study received polymyxin B, so the relative rates of kidney injury between the two agents in this population could not be assessed.  A 2017 study investigated the association between 
polymyxin treatment and kidney injury in 220 adult CF patients , 29 treated with PMB and 191 treated with 
colistin.
18 The study  found no difference in rates of AKI between PMB and colistin (34.5% vs 29.8% , p = 
0.77) in patients nor  in the rates of renal recovery by [CONTACT_2360][INVESTIGATOR_2345] (90.0% vs 91.2%, p = 1.00). 
Neurotoxicity  with the polymyxins are poorly characterized in patients with and without CF, especially 
with polymyxin B. Studies with colistin in pediatric patients with CF have found rates of neurotoxicity 
between 0 – 97.3% with many demonstrating higher rates of neurotoxicities than AKI.[ADDRESS_685503] of patient specific covariates (i.e. weight, renal function) on pharmacokinetic parameters. Patients will be monitored for nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity to ensure that PMB has an acceptable

Version  2  Date: November [ADDRESS_685504] to prospectively  assess the 
pharmacokinetics and toxicities of PMB in this patient population and will facilitat e optimal use of this 
compound in the management of acute pulmonary exacerbations of CF.  
 
4. Specific Aim/Hypothesis 
 
4.1. Measure the plasma  concentration of PMB in adult CF patients receiving  intravenous 
therapy. Adult patients with CF often receive multiple courses of antipseudomonal antibiotics 
over the course of their disease resulting in the evolution of multi -drug resistant (MDR) P. 
aeruginosa pulmonary colonizers. The polymyxins, colistin and PMB, frequently retain activity 
against MDR gram -negative bacteria. Colistin has historically been the most commonly used 
polymyxin in patients with CF; however, new pharmacokinetic (PK) and toxicity data obtained from non- CF populations suggest that PMB may achieve more consistent exposure with lower 
associated toxicit y. We aim to measure concentrations of PMB in plasma samples obtained from 
adult CF patients treated with polymyxin B using liquid chromatography –tandem mass 
spectrometry (LC -MS/MS) . 
4.2. Characterize the pharmacokinetics of PMB in adult CF patients.  There are three major 
population PK studies which inform the dosing of PMB and one small study including patients 
with CF. These studies suggest that the clearance of PMB is not related to patient body weight 
and have discordant results regarding patient renal function. Therefore, underweight patient 
populations  with excellent renal function, such as CF, may be at risk for underdosing with 
traditional weight -based regimens. We aim to use population pharmacokinetic modeling to 
characterize the PK of fixed-d ose PMB in this special population and assess the effect of patient -
specific covariates ( e.g., body weight, renal function) on PK parameters. 
4.3. Determine the safety of PMB therapy in adult CF patients. Polymyxin use is limited to salvage therapy for MDR gram -negative bacterial infections and cases of allergy, intolerance, or adverse 
effects to alternative agents due to the significant toxicities related to these compounds. 
Nephrotoxicity is the most common dose- limiting toxicity; however, it has been poorly 
characterized with PMB in patients with CF. Neurotoxicity has also been reported and occurs with moderate frequency with colistin in studies of patients with CF. We aim to characterize PMB -
associated nephrotoxicity using the Kidney Disease: Improving Global  Outcomes (KDIGO) 
criteria and neurotoxicity via patient self -report.

5.6.1.  The dose and duration of infusion for PMB will determined at the discretion of the 
prescribing physician in the course of routine clinical care. There is no study intervention 
on the dosing and administration of PMB.  
 
5.6.2.  The recommended dosing schedule for intravenous polymyxin B at Michigan Medicine 
consists of an initial weight -based loading dose (2 mg/kg, maximum of 200 mg) followed by 
100 mg every 12 hours for the duration of therapy as determined by [CONTACT_15370].  A 
reduction of the maintenance dose to 75 mg every 12 hours is recommended for patients 
with total body weight less than or equal to 50 kg.

 6.1. Population Pharmacokinetic Analysis  
 
RESEARCH PROTOCOL  
 
 
Version  2  Date: November 21 , 201 9 Page 9 
 6.1.1.  Pharmacokinetic  Modeling: The PK data will be analyzed using a population PK 
modeling approach through the  nonparamet ric adaptive grid (NPAG) algorithm in the  
PmetricsTM package for the R environment .21,[ADDRESS_685505]-order process . Michaelis -Menten and mixed- order 
linear/Michaelis Menten elimination will be tested if first -order processes alone do not 
display adequate fit of the data . 
 
For all models, the inverse of the estimated assay variance will be used as the first 
estimate for  weighting. Weighting will be accomplished by [CONTACT_527985]. Assay variance will be determined 
on a between- day basis. The analysis will be performed with adaptive γ, a scalar which is 
optimized with each cycle to produce the best approximation to the homoscedastic assumption.  
 
Models will be run for at least 100 cycles and Bayesian estimates  will be obtained for each 
patient. For each model, both the mean and median will be employed as measures of 
central tendency for the population parameter estimates and will be evaluated in the Bayesian analysis. Scatter plots will be examined for individual patients and for the 
population as a whole.  
 
6.1.2.  Monte Carlo Simulation : The parameter vector and covariance matrix from population 
PK modeling will be used as the prior distribution for the simulation function within 
Pmetrics
TM. [ADDRESS_685506] Monte Carlo simulations will be performed for candidate dosing 
regimens.  
 
The simulated  plasma  concentration- time curves  will be used to calculate area under the 
concentration- time curve (AUC) values for different 24 -hour increments  through 96 hours . 
For each regimen examined, probability of efficacy will be the fraction of the simulated subjects at each time interval for which the 24- hour AUC is between 50 – 100 mg*h/L while 
the probability of toxicity will be the fraction of subjects with 24- hour AUC values ≥ 100 
mg*h/L .

6.2. Toxicity Analysis  
 
6.2.1.  Nephrotoxicity : Nephrotoxicity will be assessed using the KDIGO criteria to define AKI. 
The nephrotoxicity endpoint will be met if subjects meet criteria for any stage of AKI by [CONTACT_527986] (Table 2). The degree of AKI will also be described by [CONTACT_527987]. Time to renal recovery after cessation of PMB and the 
proportion of patients with renal recovery by [CONTACT_2360][INVESTIGATOR_527974]. 
Renal recovery is defined as resolution of all  KDIGO criteria  for AKI .

 7. Benefits and Risks  
 
7.1. Benefits :  
 
7.1.1.  Current CF Foundation guidelines recommend that two antibiotics with activity against P. 
aeruginosa as the standard of care for treatment of acute pulmonary exacerbations. Many 
adult CF patients have had extensive lifetime exposure to antipseudomonal antibiotic therapy and may require therapy with last line agents due to multi -drug resistance in 
clinical isolates. The polymyxins, colistin and polymyxin B, are often required as combination salvage therapy for isolates with documented resistance to aminoglycosides 
or fluoroquinolones. Polymyxin B has significant pharmacokinetic advantages to colistin for CF patients; however, limited  data exist in this patient subpopulation to guide dosing in 
practice. The data generated by [CONTACT_528000] B in this population and ensure safety with commonly administered doses  extrapolated from 
non-CF patient populations . There is no direct benefit to patients enrolled in the study at 
the time of enrollment; however, patients treated with polymyxin B at the time of the study 
are at risk for re -infection with MDR organisms  in the future. Therefore, PK data obtained 
in this study could inform the dosing of polymyxin B for the treatment of future infections 
with MDR organisms.  
 
7.1.2.  Patients will not experience direct benefit from this study.  Patients will not be informed of 
study results.  
 
7.2. Risks 
 
This study poses no more than minimal risk to participants. Potential risks are as follows.  
 
7.2.1.  Accidental Disclosure of Protected Health Information (PHI)  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Frequency: Rare  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  This investigation will involve the use of PHI. With any use of PHI, the potential 
for accidental disclosure exists.  
 
7.2.2.  Adverse Effects Due to Blood Sampling  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Frequency: Rare  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  The only intervention outside of routine care in this study is blood sampling. 
Potential adverse effects of blood sampling include mild pain, anxiety/fear, bruising, 
hematoma, arterial  puncture, nerve damage, re -bleeding, phlebitis, or vasovagal 
reactions.  
 
7.3. Protection Against Risks 
 
7.3.1.  Accidental Disclosure of Protected Health Information (PHI)  
We will follow standard practice for protecting research data (locked cabinets/offices requiring key access, restricted access, use of secure servers). Protection of participant 
confidentiality will be maintained by [CONTACT_528001]  a unique identification 
number.  Only this number will be used on study documents that relate to the subject.  All 
physical data will be stored in a locked cabinet within a locked office. Electronic study

 data will be maintained on University of Michigan servers in M+Box and accessed 
through University devices or VP N. Access to PHI will be restricted to IRB -approved 
study personnel. All data will be codified prior to analysis . 
 
7.3.2.  Adverse Effects Due to Blood Sampling  
To minimize the risks associated with blood sampling, blood samples will be obtained by a member of the study team who has received training specific to blood sampling. Best 
practice procedures for phlebotomy will be followed. A maximum of 5 mL of blood will be 
removed per sample for a maximum  total volume of 30 mL per patient, which is less than 
10% of the volume removed in a standard blood donation. When possible, existing indwelling central venous access will be used to obtain samples to avoid additional venipuncture.  
 
8. Adverse Events  
 8.1. Reporting Plan  
We will utilize a study specific adverse event (AE) reporting plan and only report adverse events directly related to the venipuncture or venous access to the IRB  per the recommended 
guideline.  
 
8.2. Other Reportable Information or Occurrence  
Any breach of confidentiality will be reported immediately to the IRB.

b. Cryovials  
i. Label [ADDRESS_685509] with:  
1) study protocol number  
2) the study subject code  
a) color code with a highlighter pen (yellow, pi[INVESTIGATOR_8745], green, orange) the 
subject code if more than one subject is to be studied on the same 
date 
b) the color code should match the plasma collection tube for each 
subject to reduce the risk of potential transfer error  
3) date of collection  
4) sample code (i.e. C 0, C1, etc.) 
5) aliquot number (AQ -1, AQ -2) 
ii. Transfer cryovials to a rack

subject is to be studied on the same day  
 
c. Cryovial boxes  
i. Label 2 cryovial boxes with:  
1) study protocol number  
2) date of collection  
3) aliquot number (AQ -1 and AQ -2) 
 
4. B lood Sample Collection and Processing  
a. Collection  
i. Collect venous blood in pre-labeled and chilled lavender  top plasma collection tubes  
ii. Invert the plasma collection tube ten times slowly and gently to ensure adequate 
mixing of the EDTA with the sample  
iii. Immediately replace the sample tube upright in the test -tube rack within the study 
cooler  
iv. Record actual time of sample collection in sample collection log  
 
b. Processing  
i. Centrifuge the whole blood at 3000 rpm for 12 minutes in a refrigerated centrifuge 
set to 4°C  
ii. Transfer the supernatant (plasma) to pre- labeled cryovials in 0.5 – 1 mL aliquots of 
equal volume, taking care not to disturb the buffy coat.  
1) See the section below for management of insufficient sample volume  
iii. Place cryovials into the appropriate cryovial boxes ordered by [CONTACT_528002]  2  Date: November 21 , 201 9 Page 19  
 1) More than one subject can be stored in each cryovial box.  Do not divide a 
samples for a single subject between more than one cryovial box  
iv. Store cryovial boxes at -80°C  until analysis  
1) The time from blood collection until the plasma sample is stored at -8 0°C 
should be 90 minutes or less.  
 
c. Potential Problems  
i. Hemolysis  
1) Samples with visible  hemolysis  may be processed as noted  
2) The cryovials for hemolyzed samples should be marked with the term “Hemo”  
 
ii. Insufficient sample volume  
1) An insufficient sample volume is less than 0.5 mL of plasma  
2) If between 0.25 -0.5 mL: 
a)  Transfer plasma to two labeled cryovials in aliquots of  equal volume  
3) If less than 0.25 mL:  
a) Transfer  plasma into the cryovial labeled “ AQ-1” only  
b) Mark the cryovial labeled “ AQ-2” with the term  “ISV” , which indicates  
“insufficient sample volume”  
c) Place the “AQ -2” cryovial labeled “ISV”  in the appropriate slot in the 
“AQ-2” cryovial box  inverted, so that the cap is facing downward 
rather than upward .

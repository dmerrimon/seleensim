[CONTACT_741963] (other than any eye drops  provided) are not allowed to be used during the study.   
Study Duration of Treatment:  
Approximately 3 weeks  
Criteria  for Evaluation : 
‒ The primary endpoint is the proportion of subject s agreeing with the statement “Clear vision: near, 
far, and in-between”  
Statistical Methods:  
Continuous variables will be summarized using the sample size, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum. Categorical variables will be summarized using frequencies and percentages.  
The responses to the primary endpoint statement will be summarized using categorical summary statistics (strongly agree, agree, slightly agree, neither agree nor disagree, slightly disagree, disagree, strongly disagree).  
Responses of strongly agree, agree, and slightly agree w ill be coded to a category “Agree.” Responses of 
strongly disagree, disagree, and slightly disagree will be coded to a category “Disagree.” The trichotomized responses will be summarized categorically (agree, neither agree nor disagree, disagree).  
Neutral  responses ( i.e., “neither agree nor disagree”) will not be included in the primary statistical analysis.  The 
non-neutral  responses used for the analysis will be presented using categorical summary statistics (agree, 
disagree). An exact 95% confidence interval around the proportion of subjects agreeing with the statement will be presented along with the p- value from a one- sided exact binomial test of the alternative hypothesis is that the 
proportion of subject s agreeing is greater than 0.5.  
Sample Size  Calculations:  
Approximately [ADDRESS_1170686] s will be enrolled. Allowing for up to 10% losses, power calculations were completed 
for [ADDRESS_1170687] with a nominal 5% one -sided significance level will have 
93% power to detect the difference between the Null hypothesis proportion, π₀ of 0.5 and the Alternative 
proportion, π ₁, of 0.6 when the sample size is 270.

could potentially affect ocular physiology or lens performance are prohibited during the 
course of the study.  
5.5 Treatment Compliance 
Treatment compliance will be assessed using lens wear parameter data.  
5.6 Protocol Deviations 
A deviation from the protocol is an unintended and/or unanticipated departure from the 
procedures and/or processes approved by [CONTACT_842400]. It is a Sponsor expectation that Investigators will follow  the protocol and 
procedures as written. The Sponsor will not grant protocol waivers for this study. The Investigator may implement a deviation from the protocol to eliminate an immediate hazard to study subject s without prior IRB approval. As soon as poss ible after such an 
occurrence, the implemented deviation, as well as the reasons for it should be submitted to the IRB for review and approval. It should also be submitted to the Sponsor for agreement, and to the regulatory authorities, if required. 
In the  event a protocol deviation occurs, the date of and reason for deviations must be 
documented in all cases. Significant or major protocol deviations impacting the rights or 
safety of the subject,  or the integrity of the study must be reported by [CONTACT_367807]. Reporting of all other protocol deviations must adhere to the requirements of the governing IRB. Unless the protocol deviations put the subject  at risk or the subject ’s condition requires that they be discontinued from the study, 
subject s may continue to participate until the end of the study. 
Site Corrective Action Plans will be developed and completed as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_1034], Sponsor designee (e.g., CRO) for sites or Investigators who deviate from this protocol in a way that adversely affects the rights, safety, or well-being of the subject (s) and/or the quality or integrity of data. The Site Corrective Action Plan will 
outline the deviation and the site’s corrective and/or remedial actions. Decisions regarding critical deviations that merit Investigator disqualification and site closure will be made by [CONTACT_240373].

An AE is any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or injury, or untoward 
clinical signs (including abnormal laboratory findings) in subject s, users, or other persons, 
whether or not related to the investigational medical dev ice, comparator, or the procedures 
involved. For users or other persons, this definition is restricted to events not related to investigational medical devices . 
6.1.1 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Definition s 
An AE that (related or not related to the investigation al test articles , comparator products 
or study procedures): 
o Led to death. 
o Led to serious deterioration in the health of the subject, that resulted in: 
‒ A life -threatening illness or injury; or 
‒ A permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function (e.g., 
blindness); or 
‒ Inpatient or prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or 
‒ Medical or surgical intervention to prevent life- threatening illness or 
injury or permanent impairment to a body structure or a body function. 
o Led to fetal distress, fetal death, or a congenita l abnormality or birth defect.  
Note: A planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a pre -existing condition, or a procedure 
required by [CONTACT_760], without serious deterioration in health, is not considered 
an SAE. 
Serious adverse events may include  but are not limited to  any hazardous, sight- threatening 
conditions occurring after exposure to the investigational test article  or control product  
including, but not limited to, the following: 
• A presumed infectious ulcer (defined as a progressive erosion of the corneal 
tissue). For the purposes of reporting, this includes:

6.1.[ADDRESS_1170746] (ADE) Definition s 
An adverse device effect is an  AE that is  assessed to be related to the use of an 
investigational medical device. This definition includes AEs resulting from insufficient or inadequate instructions for use; deployment, implantation, installation, or operation; or any malfunction of the investigational medical device. This definition also includes any event resulting from use error or from intentional misuse of the investigational medical device.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Anticipated Serious Adverse Device Effect  (ASADE)  Definition  
An a nticipated serious adverse device effect (ASADE) is an ADE that first meets the 
serious criteria (see Section 6.1.1) and which , by [CONTACT_5942], incidence, severity or outcome, 
has been previously identified in the investigational plan or application (including a 
Study #916 - Protocol

• Poor visual acuity (reduced sharpness of vision) 
• Moderate to severe eye pain not relieved by [CONTACT_288830] 
[IP_ADDRESS] Unantic ipated Serious Adverse Device E ffect (U SADE)  Definitions  
An unanticipated serious ocular or non -ocular adverse device effect is an adverse event 
related to the use of an investigational medical device that has resulted in any of the 
consequences characteristic of a serious adverse event as described in Section 6.1.1 and 
which by [CONTACT_5942], incidence, severity or outcome has not been identified in the current versio n of the risk analysis report.  
This definition includes but is not limited to AE s resulting from insufficient or inadequate 
instructions for use, deployment, implantation, installation, or operation, or any malfunction of the investigational medical devic e.  
This definition also includes any event resulting from use error or from intentional misuse of the investigational medical device.  [LOCATION_003]DEs include but are not limited to  
• Any central or paracentral (within 6 mm of cornea) corneal event that results in permanent opacification (s uch as corneal scar or  vascularization)

6.1.5 Relationship Definition: Study Device and/or Other Study Materials  
• Related: There is at least a reason able possibility that the AE  is related to 
the study device (study solution) and/or r ewetting drops. Reasonable 
possibility means that th ere is evidence to suggest a causal relationship or 
association between the study device and/or r ewetting drops and the AE.   
• Not related:  There is little or no reasonable possibility that the AE  is 
related to the study device (study solution) and/or r ewet ting drops. This 
assessment implies that the AE has no evidence to suggest either a causal relationship or association to the study device and/or Rewetting Drops and a more likely or certain alternative etiology exists.  
6.1.6 Severity  Definitions  
• Mild:  Subject awareness of a sign or symptom that is easily tolerated, 
requires no treatment, and does not interfere with subject’s daily activities.  
Study #916 - Protocol  
Amendment 1 29 NOVEMBER  2022   Page 36 of 84 
 • Moderate:  Subject awareness of a sign or symptom which may be a low 
level of concern to the subject and may interfere wit h daily activities but can 
be relieved by [CONTACT_119106].  
• Severe:  A sign or symptom that interrupts the subject’s daily activity and 
requires systemic therapy or other treatment 
6.[ADDRESS_1170747] ’s 
end of participation in the study must be reported.  If there is an Ongoing AE at the time 
of subject’s discontinuation or at 3- Week Follow up visit, Unscheduled visit(s) must be 
scheduled to follow up on the AEs until the event resolves or stabilize. 
Ocular AEs of possible clinical significance should be photo-documented and shared with 
the Medical Monitor in electronic form.  
When evaluating for reportable AEs,  the Investigator should refer to the definitions for 
AEs to determine : 
a) whether the event is serious (refer to  Section  6.1.1 and Section 6.1.2)  
b) whether the event is severe (refer to Section 6.1.6) 
c) whether the event is s ignificant (refer to Section  6.1.2 and  Section  6.1.3) 
d) whether the event is related to the study device (refer to Section 6.1.5) 
6.2.1 Procedures for Reporting Serious or Significant Adverse Events  
An AE classified as a SAE or a Significant Non -Serious Ocular AE require s expeditious 
handling and reporting to the Sponsor to comply with regulatory requirements, as follows:  
• To ensure subject safety, all SAEs , regardless of relationship to the IMP , must 
be immediately ( i.e., within a maximum 24 HOURS after becoming aware of 
the event) reported  to the Lexitas and Sponsor. All information relevant to the 
SAE must be recorded on the Sponsor provided SAE report form  signed by 
[CONTACT_737]. Within [ADDRESS_1170748] copy SAE report form and send  
the form to  the following email distribution:  
  
• The investigator must verify that the report was received by [CONTACT_842401]/or 
Sponsor. If the investigator is not able to verify it was successfully received by [CONTACT_842401]/or Sponsor , the investigator must call the CRO  clinical study 
manager by [CONTACT_367810]-up. The CRO will forward the documentation to the medical monitor and the sponsor for review. 
• Investigators should not wait to receive additional information to fully document the event before initially notifying Lexitas and Sponsor of an SAE or a Significant Non-Serious AE. Additional relevant information such as 

Study #916 - Protocol  
Amendment 1 29 NOVEMBER  2022   Page 37 of 84 
 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_842364].  
• The Investigator should take all appropriate measures to ensure the safety of 
the subjects: notably, he/she should follow a subject with an SAE or Significant Non -Serious AE until the event has resolved or the condition has 
stabilized. This may imply that follow -up will continue after the subject has 
left the study, and that additional evaluations may be requested by [CONTACT_1034]. 
• Ensure that the subject’s identity is protected and the subject’ s identifiers in 
the clinical trial are pro perly mentioned on the form. 
• BEGIN TREATMENT OF THE AE IMMEDIATELY BY A SUITABLY LICENSED EYE CARE PROFESSIONAL.  
• Continue to update the paper SAE or Significant Non-Serious AE Report 
Form , if applicable, each time the subject is seen during the management of 
the event  and at resolution of the event .  All updated report forms should be 
submitted by [CONTACT_842402] [ADDRESS_1170749] them to the Lexitas and 
Sponsor. 
• Events requiring medical treatment will be evaluated by [CONTACT_1034]. Upon review of the medical treatment, Bausch + Lomb Clinical Operations representatives may contact [CONTACT_842403] f urther information 
concerning the treatment . 
• Report all [LOCATION_003]DEs to the reviewing IRB within 10 working days following awareness of the U SADE or according to the established reporting procedures 
of the IRB, whichever is shorter. 
• Submit all bills, prescription receipts, and culture reports/fees related to the AE to the Bausch + Lomb Clinical Operations.  Expense incurred for study related medical treatment will be paid by [CONTACT_59268] +Lomb Clinical Operations.

6.2.3 Device Deficiencies : Definition and Reporting Procedures  
A device deficiency is defined as an inadequacy of a medical device with respect to its identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety, or performance. Device deficiencies include malfunct ions, use errors, and inadequate labeling.  
Investigators must evaluate, record, and report any complaints/ deficiencies or malfunctions experienced with the study solution  during this trial to the Medical Monitor  
Study #916 - Protocol  
Amendment 1 29 NOVEMBER  2022   Page 38 of 84 
 promptly. The  Sponsor and Medical Monitor  shall review all device deficiencies,  and, upon 
the Sponsor’s request, Investigators must supply any additional information related to the 
safety reporting of a particular event.  
Report device deficiencies within 24 hours of knowledge to: 
  
The Medical Monitor will distribute, within [ADDRESS_1170751] led to a n SAE. In the event of a disagreement between the Sponsor 
and the Investigator(s), the Sponsor shall communicate both opi[INVESTIGATOR_367772]. 
6.2.4 Procedures for Culturing  of Co rneal U lcer or Suspected O cular I nfection  
For purposes of this study, the Sponsor requests that cultures should be obtained in cases 
of corneal ulcer or suspected ocular infection, unless medically contraindicated. Cultures should be taken from the cul -de-sac, lower  eyelid margin, and the corneal lesion (if 
applicable). The required culturing techniques are outlined in Appendix B . 
When a culture is obtained, the contact [CONTACT_240376]. 
Microbial data generated from returned subject supplies ( e.g., lenses, lens cases, and/or 
lens case solutions) are for information only. Because microbes may be introduced into 
subject supplies during use, recovery of microbes from returned subject supplies cannot be presumed to indicate etiology or direction of organism transmission. 
The ocular cultures, along w ith the associated contact [CONTACT_145924], will 
be sent to the local clinical laboratory designated by [CONTACT_240377]. The clinical 
laboratory will report the culture results to the Investigator who will record the results in the eCRF . 
6.2.[ADDRESS_1170752] they might be pregnant (e.g., missed,  
or late menstrual period). Female sub jects who become pregnant during the study will be 
followed until completion of pregnancy. Every effort will be made to obtain the health status of the mother and infant or fetus (in cases of miscarriage or therapeutic abortion) at term. Pregnancy itself i s not considered an AE. 
All confirmed pregnancies must be reported on a Pregnancy Report  and submitted to the 
Medical M onitor via facsimile or email transmission within 24  hours of the Investigator’s 
awareness of the pregnancy.  The Medical Monitor will distribute the completed report to 
the Sponsor as per the distribution listed below. 
All pregnancies will be followed until outcome even after study closure.  The outcome of 
all pregnancies will be reported on a  paper Pregnancy Outcome Report  and submitted t o 
the Medical Monitor via facsimile or email transmission once the outcome is learned. The Medical Monitor will distribute the completed report to the Sponsor as per the distribution 
listed below.

7.0 STATISTICAL METHODS  
7.1 Assessment of Effective ness 
Analyses of effectiveness outcomes will be completed using the Full Analysis Set. 
7.1.1 Primary Effectiveness Endpoints  
[IP_ADDRESS] Clear Vision: Near, Far, and In- Between  
The primary endpoint will be assessed as part of the online consumer survey. The responses 
to the primary endpoint statement will be summarized using categorical summary statistics (strongly agree, agree, slightly agree, neither agree nor disagree, slightly disagree, disagree, strongly disagree). 
Responses of strongly agree, agree, and slightly agree will be coded to a category “Agree.” 
Responses of strongly disagree, disagree, and slightly disagree will be coded to a category 
“Disagree.” The trichotomized responses will be summarized categorically (agree, neither agree nor disagree, disagree).  
Neutral responses (i.e., “neither agree nor disagree”) will not be included in the primary statistical analysis. The non-neutral  responses used for the analysis will be presented using 
categorical summary statistics (agree, disagree). An exact 95 % confidence interval around 
the proportion of subjects agreeing with the statement will be presented along with the p -
value from a one -sided exact binomial test of the alternative hypothesis is that the 
proportion of subject s agreeing is greater than 0.5. 
7.1.2 Secondary Effectiveness Endpoints  
There are no predefined secondary effectiveness endpoints. 
7.1.3 Supportive Effectiveness  
[IP_ADDRESS] Consumer Survey  
Agreement with statements in the online consumer survey will be analyzed using the 
methods described for the primary endpoint.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Investigator Questionnaire  
The following investigator questionnaire will also be evaluated using one -sided exact 
binomial test of the alternative hypothesis is that the proportion of subject s agreeing is 
greater than 0.5.

3. PRECAUTIONS  
You should be aware of and fully discuss with your study doctor the following safety precautions:  
− Do not use saliva or anything other than the recommended solutions for lubricating or wetting your lenses. 
− If the lens sticks (stops moving), you should use a solution intended to lubricate or rewet a 
contact [CONTACT_13293], as recommend by [CONTACT_506800] . The lens should move freely on 
your eye for the continued health of your eye. If non- movement of the lens continues, you 
should immediately consult your study doctor. Do not attempt to remove the lens, except 
on the instructions of your study doctor. 
Study #916 - Protocol   
Amendment 1 29 NOVEMBER 2022  Page 72 of 84 − Always wash and rinse your hands before handling lenses. Do not get cosmetics, lotions, 
soaps, creams, deodorants, or sprays in your eyes or on the lenses. It is best to put on lenses before putting on makeup. Water -base cosmetics are l ess likely to damage lenses than oil -
base products. 
− Do not touch contact [CONTACT_842411], as microscopic scratches of the lenses may occur, causing distorted vision and/or injury to your eye. 
− Carefully follow these handling, insertion, and wearing instructions for the daily disposable contact [CONTACT_742013].

− As with any contact [CONTACT_13293], follow -up visits are necessary to assure the continuing health of 
your eyes. Your study doctor should provide you with a recommended follow -up schedule. 
4. ADVERSE REACTIONS (Problems and What to Do) 
You should be aware that the following problems may occur: 
− Eyes stinging, burning, itching (irritation), or other eye pain, 
− Comfort is less than when lens was first placed  on eye,  
− Abnormal feeling of something in the eye (foreign body, scratched area), 
− Excessive watering (tearing) of the eyes,  
− Unusual eye secretions, 
− Redness of the eyes,  
− Reduced sharpness of vision (poor visual acuity), 
− Blurred vision, rainbows, or halos around objects, 
− Sensitivity to light (photophobia), 
− Dry eyes.  
If you notice any of the above, you should: 
− Immediately remove your lenses.  
Study #916 - Protocol   
Amendment 1 29 NOVEMBER 2022  Page 73 of 84 − If the discomfort or problem stops, then look closely at the lens. If the lens has dirt, an 
eyelash, or other foreign body on it, or the problem stops and the lens appears undamaged, insert a new lens. After insertion of a new lens, if the problem continues, you should immediately remove the lenses and consult your study doctor. 
When any of the above problems occur, a serious condition such as infection, corneal ulcer, 
neovascularization, or iritis may be present. You should keep the lens off your eye and seek immediately professional identification of the problem and prompt treatment to avoid serious eye damage.  
5. PER SONAL CLEANLINESS and LENS HANDLING  
− Preparing the Lens for Wearing:  
It is essential that you learn and use good hygienic methods in the care and handling of the lenses. Cleanliness is the first and most important aspect of proper contact [CONTACT_224037]. In particular, your hands should be clean and free of any foreign substances when you handle your lenses. The procedures are:  
○ Always wash your hands thoroughly with mild soap, rinse completely, and dry with a lint-free towel before touching your lenses. 
○ Avoid the  use of soaps containing cold cream, lotion, or oily cosmetics before handling 
your lenses, since these substances may come into contact [CONTACT_145944]. 
○ Handle your lenses with your fingertips and be careful to avoid contact [CONTACT_145945]. It is helpful to keep your fingernails short and smooth. 
○ Start off correctly by [CONTACT_145946].  
○ Should you accidentally place an inside -out lens on your eye, one of the following signs 
should signal you to remove and replace it correctly: 
▪ Less than usual comfort, 
▪ The lens may fold on the eye, 
▪ Excessive lens movement on blink, 
▪ Blurred vision. 
If the lens folds and sticks together: Place the lens in the palm of your hand and GENTLY rub the 
lens between your index finger and palm in a gentle back and forth motion. Replace the lens if it does not unfold. 
If the lens flattens or drapes across your finger, the lens or your finger may be too wet. To correct 
this, dry your finger by [CONTACT_145947], drying 
the opposite finger each time. 
- Placing the Lens on the Eye:  
There are other methods of lens placement. If the following methods are difficult for you, your study doctor will provide you with an alternate method. 
Note : If after placement of the lens, your vision is blurred, check for the following: 
○ The lens is not centered on the eye (see “Centering the Lens,” next in these instructions). 
Study #916 - Protocol   
Amendment 1 29 NOVEMBER 2022  Page 74 of 84 ○ If the lens is c entered, remove the lens (see “Removing the Lens” section) and check 
for the following: 
▪ Cosmetics or oils on the lens (replace the lens), 
▪ The lens is on the wrong eye, 
▪ The lens is inside-out (it would also not be as comfortable as normal). 
If you find that  your vision is still blurred after checking the above possibilities, remove both lenses 
and consult your eye professional. The One -Hand Placement Technique  
Place the lens on your index finger. Head up, looking straight 
ahead, pull down your lower eyelid with the middle finger of your placement hand. Look up steadily at a point above you. Then place the lens on the lower white part of your eye. Remove your index finger and slowly release the lower lid. Look down to position the lens properly. Close your eyes for a moment; the lens will center itself on your eye.  
The Two -Hand Placement Technique  
With the lens on your index finger, use the middle finger of the other hand to pull the upper lid against the brow. Use the middle finger of your placement hand to pull down the lower lid and then place the lens centrally on your eye. While holding this position, look downward to position the lens properly. Slowly release your eyelids.  
If the lens feels uncomfortable, then look in the mirror and gently place a finger on the edge of the contact [CONTACT_145948]. Then by [CONTACT_145949], the lens will re -center itself. If the lens still feels uncomfortable, follow the steps described in the 
section of these instructions entitled “Adverse Reactions.” 
− Centering the Lens : 
Very rarely, a lens that is on the cornea will be displaced onto the white part of the eye during lens wear. This can also occur during placement and removal of the lenses if the correct techniques are not performed properly. To center a lens, follow one of the procedures below. 
Hold the upper and lower eyelids open with your fingers. Then while looking in a mirror, gently 
place a finger on the contact [CONTACT_842412] t he center of the eye.  
Or 
Hold the upper and lower eyelids open with your fingers. Then, while looking in a mirror, move your eye towards the lens to place it on the center of the eye.  
− Removing the Lens:  
Always remove the same lens first.  
1) Always wash your hands thoroughly with mild soap, rinse completely, and dry with a lint-free towel before touching your lenses.  

Study #916 - Protocol   
Amendment 1 29 NOVEMBER 2022  Page 75 of 84 2) Always be sure that the lens is in the correct position on your eye before you try to remove 
it (a simple check of your vision, closing one  eye at a time, will tell you if the lens is in the correct 
position). Look up and slowly pull down your lower eyelid with the middle finger of your removal 
hand and place your index finger on the lower edge of lens. Squeeze the lens lightly between the thumb and the index finger and remove it. Avoid sticking the edges of the lens together. 
3) Remove the other lens by [CONTACT_145951]. 
Note: If this method of removing your lens is difficult for you, your study doctor will provide you 
with an alternate method.  
− Care for a Sticking (Nonmoving) Lens: 
It is important to the health of your eyes that your contact [CONTACT_686135]. If a lens sticks (stops 
moving), use a solution intended to lubricate or rewet a contact [CONTACT_13293], as recommend by [CONTACT_842413] . In this case, do not use plain water or anything other than the recommended solutions. 
Do not attempt to remove a lens that is sticking, which could damage your eye. If the lens does not begin to move when you blink after several applications of the solution or, contact [CONTACT_458398]. Do not attempt to remove the lens except on the advice of your study doctor. 
6. EMERGENCIES  
If chemicals of any kind (household products, gardening solutions, laboratory chemicals, etc.) 
are splashed into your eyes, you should: FLUSH EYES IMMED IATELY WITH TAP 
WATER AND THEN REMOVE LENSES PROMPTLY. CONTACT [CONTACT_842414] A HOSPI[INVESTIGATOR_35466]

WARNINGS  
After a thorough eye examination, including appropriate medical background, subjects should be fully apprised by [CONTACT_842417]. Subjects should be advised of the following warnings pertaining to contact [CONTACT_13279]: 
• Problems with contact [CONTACT_842418]. It is essential that 
subjects follow their eye care professional’s direction and all labeling instructions for proper use of lenses. Eye problems, including corneal ulcers, can develop rapi[INVESTIGATOR_145908] . 
• Daily disposable lenses are not indicated for overnight wear, and subjects should be instructed not to wear lenses while sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007] . Clinical studies have shown that the risk of 
serious adverse reactions is increased when daily disposable lenses are worn overnight. 
• Studies have shown that contact [CONTACT_145938] a higher incidence of adverse reactions than nonsmokers. 
• If a subject experiences eye discomfort, excessive tearing, vision changes, or redness of the eye, the subject should be instructed to immediately remove lenses  and promptly contact [CONTACT_842419].  
• Patients should be instructed not to expose their contact [CONTACT_35551].  Water can harbor microorganisms that can lead to severe infection, vision loss, or blindness.  If their contact [CONTACT_842420], lakes, or oceans, the contact  [CONTACT_842421] a new pair.  Recommendations for 
wearing lenses during any water activity should be discussed with the patient. 
 
PRECAUTIONS  
Precautions for Eye Care Professionals:  
• Due to the small number of subjects enrolled in clinical investigation of lenses, all refractive 
powers, design configurations, or lens parameters available in the lens material are not evaluated in significant numbers. Consequently, when selecting an appropriate lens design and parameters, the eye care professional should consider all characteristics of the lens that can affect lens performance and ocular health, including oxygen permeability, wettability, central and peripheral thickness, and optic zone diameter. 
• The potential impact of these factor s on the subject’s ocular health should be carefully weighed 
against the subject's need for refractive correction; therefore, the continuing ocular health of the subject and lens performance on eye should be carefully monitored by [CONTACT_288818]. 
Study #916 - Protocol   
Amendment 1 29 NOVEMBER 2022  Page 78 of 84 • Subjects who wear contact [CONTACT_842422].  Visual requirements vary with the individual and should be considered when selecting the most appropriate type of lens for each subject. 
• Eye care professional should instruct the patients to remove the lens immediately if the eye becomes red or irritated.  
• Fluorescein should not be used while the subject is wearing the lenses, because the lenses will become dis colored. Whenever fluorescein is used, flush the eyes with sterile saline solution. 
Wait at least 5 minutes before inserting new lenses. If it is not possible to flush the eyes, wait a minimum of 1 hour before inserting new lenses. If inserted too soon, the lenses may absorb residual fluorescein.  
• Before leaving the eye care professional’s office, the subject should be able to promptly remove lenses.  
• The lenses are prescribed for disposable wear and are to be stored for return to the eye care professional once they are removed from the subject’s eye. It is important that subjects be instructed to always have available a pair of replacement lenses. In the event that a lens must be removed from the eye because of dust, a foreign body or other contaminant gets on the lens, or the lens becomes dehydrated, the lens should be removed and replaced with a replacement lens. 
Eye care professionals should carefully instruct subjects about the following safety precautions: 
• If the lens sticks (stops moving) on the eye, follow the recommended directions on Care for a Sticking Lens. The lens should move freely on the eye for the continued health of the eye. If non-movement of the lens continues, the subject should be instructed to immediately  consult 
his or her eye care professional. Do not attempt to remove the lens, except on the instructions of the eye care professional.  
• Always wash and rinse hands before handling lenses. Do not get cosmetics, lotions, soaps, creams, deodorants, or sprays in the eyes or on the lenses. It is  best to put on lenses before 
putting on makeup. Water -base cosmetics are less likely to damage lenses than oil -base 
products. 
• Do not touch contact [CONTACT_842423], as microscopic scratches of  the lenses may occur, causing distorted vision and/or 
injury to the eye. 
• Carefully follow the handling, insertion, removal, and wearing instructions in the Subject Instructions and those prescribed by [CONTACT_288820]. 
• Never wear lenses beyond th e period recommended by [CONTACT_288820]. 
• If aerosol products such as hair spray are used while wearing lenses, exercise caution and keep eyes closed until the spray has settled. 
• Always handle lenses gently and avoid droppi[INVESTIGATOR_35459]. 
• Avoid all harmful or irritating vapors and fumes while wearing lenses. 
• Ask the eye care professional about wearing lenses during water activities and other sports. 
• Inform the doctor (health care professional) about being a contact [CONTACT_35560]. 
• Never use tweezers or other  tools to remove lenses from the lens container unless specifically 
indicated for that use. Pour the lens into the hand. 
Study #916 - Protocol   
Amendment 1 29 NOVEMBER 2022  Page 79 of 84 • Do not touch the lens with fingernails. 
• Always contact [CONTACT_742029]. 
• Always inform t he employer of being a contact [CONTACT_35560]. Some jobs may require use of eye 
protection equipment or may require that the subject not wear contact [CONTACT_13276]. 
• As with any contact [CONTACT_13293], follow -up visits are necessary to assure the continuing health of the 
subject’s eyes. The subject should be instructed as to a recommended follow-up schedule. 
 
ADVERSE REACTIONS  
The subject should be informed that the following problems may occur: 
• Eyes stinging, burning, itching (irritation), or other eye pain, 
• Comfort is le ss than when lens was first placed on eye, 
• Abnormal feeling of something in the eye (foreign body, scratched area), 
• Excessive watering (tearing) of the eyes,  
• Unusual eye secretions, 
• Redness of the eyes,  
• Reduced sharpness of vision (poor visual acuity), 
• Blurred vision, rainbows, or halos around objects, 
• Sensitivity to light (photophobia), 
• Dry eyes.  
If the subject notices any of the above, he or she should be instructed to: 
• Immediately remove lenses.  
• If the discomfort or problem stops, then look closely at the lens. If the lens is in any way 
damaged, do not put the lens back on the eye. Place the lens in the storage case and contact [CONTACT_288820]. If the lens has dirt, an eyelash, or other foreign body on it, or the problem stops and the lens appears undamaged, the subject should insert a new lens. After insertion of a new lens, if the problem continues, the subject should immediately remove the lenses and consult the eye care professional . 
If the above symptoms continue after removal of the lens, or upon insertion of a new lens, the subject should immediately remove the lenses and contact [CONTACT_842424], who must determine the need for examination, treatment,  or referral without delay.

 IMPORTANT TREATMENT INFORMATION FOR ADVERSE REACTIONS  
Sight-threatening ocular complications associated with contact [CONTACT_842425][INVESTIGATOR_375], and 
therefore early recognition and tre atment of problems are critical. Infectious corneal ulceration is 
one of the most serious potential complications and may be ambiguous in its early stage. 
Study #[ADDRESS_1170771] therapy for corneal abrasions such as eye patching or the use of steroids or steroid/antibiotic combinations may exacerbate the condition. If the subject is wearing a contact [CONTACT_742031], the lens should be removed immed iately, and the lens and lens care products retained for analysis and culturing. 
 
SELECTION OF SUBJECTS  
Persons who require vision correction and who would not or could not adhere to the replacement 
regimen for the Bausch + Lomb daily disposable contact [CONTACT_842426]. Failure to follow handling instructions could lead to serious eye infections, which might result in corneal ulcers. 
Subject communication is vital because it relates not only to subject selection but also to ensure 
compliance. It is also necessary to discuss the information contained in the Subject Instructions with the subject at the time of the initial examination. Subjects selected to wear the Bausch + Lomb daily disposable contact [CONTACT_842427], general health, and cooperation. The eye care professional must take care in selecting, examining, and instructing contact [CONTACT_742034]. Subject hygiene and willingness to fol low eye care professional 
instructions are essential to their success.  
A detailed history is crucial to determining subject needs and expectations. Your subject should be questioned regarding vocation, desired lens -wearing time (full or part time), and des ired lens usage 
(reading, recreation,  or hobbies). Initial evaluation of the lens should be preceded by a complete 
eye examination, including visual acuity, keratometry, and slit lamp examination. 
It is normal for the subject to experience mild symptoms such as lens awareness, variable vision, 
occasional tearing (watery eyes), and slight redness during the adaptation period. Although the adaptation period varies for each individual, generally within one week these symptoms will disappear. If these symptoms persist, the subject should be instructed to contact [CONTACT_288816]. 
 FITTING PROCEDURE  
1. Pre-fitting Examination  
A pre -fitting subject history and examination are necessary to: 
− determine whether a subject is a suitable candidate for daily disposable contact [CONTACT_13276] 
(consider subject hygiene and mental and physical state), 
− make ocular measurements for initial contact [CONTACT_367835], and  
− collect and record baseline clinical information to which post -fitting examination results 
can be compared.  
A pre -fitting examination should include spherocylindrical refraction and VA, keratometry, and 
biomicroscopic examination. 
Study #916 - Protocol   
Amendment 1 29 NOVEMBER 2022  Page 81 of 84 2. Initial Lens Power Selection  
− Lens power is determined from the subject's spherical equivalent prescription corrected to 
the corneal plane.  
− Select the appropriate power lens and place the lens on the eye. Allow the lens to remain on the eye long enough ( 10 minutes) to achieve a state of equilibrium. Small variations in 
the tonicity, pH of the lens solutions, and individual tear composition may cause slight changes in fitting characteristics.  
− Allow any increase in tear flow to subside before evaluating the lens. The time required will vary with the individual.  
3. Initial Lens Evaluation  
− To determine proper lens parameters,  observe the lens relationship to the eye using a slit 
lamp.  
○ Movement: The lens should provide discernible movement with: 
▪ Primary gaze blink  
▪ Up gaze blink 
▪ Up gaze lag  
○ Centration: The lens should provide full corneal coverage. 
− Lens evaluation allows the contact [CONTACT_842428]/cornea relationship in the 
same manner as would be done with any daily disposable soft lens. 
4. Criteria of a Well -Fitted Lens  
If the initial lens selection fully covers the cornea, provides discernible movement after a blink, is comfortable and provides satisfactory visual performance, it is a well -fitted lens and can be 
dispensed. 
5. Characteristics of a Tight (Steep) Lens  
A lens which is much too steep may subjectively and objectively cause distortion which will vary 
after a blink. However, if a lens is only marginally steep, the initial subjective and objective vision and comfort findings may be quite good. A marginally steep lens may be differentiated from a properly fitted lens by [CONTACT_742035]. A prope rly fitted lens will tend to slide 
downward approximately 0.5 mm while a steep lens will remain relatively stable in relationship to 
the cornea, particularly with the blink. 
6. Characteristics of a Loose (Flat) Lens  
If the lens is too flat, it will:  
− Decenter, especially on post -blink. 
− Have a tendency to edge lift inferiorly and sit on the lower lid, rather than positioning 
between the sclera and palpebral conjunctiva.  
− Have a tendency to be uncomfortable and irritating with fluctuating vision. 
− Have a t endency to drop or lag greater than 2.[ADDRESS_1170772] -blink. 
7. Follow- up Care  
− From the day of dispensing, the following schedule is required for this study. 
○ 1-Week Follow -Up Visit  
○ 3-Week Follow -Up Visit  
Study #916 - Protocol   
Amendment 1 29 NOVEMBER 2022  Page 82 of 84 − Prior to a follow -up examination, the contact [CONTACT_842429] [ADDRESS_1170773] lens wear.  
− With lenses in place on the eyes, evaluate fitting performance to assure that CRITERIA OF A WELL FITTED LENS continue to be satisfied. Examine the lenses closely for surface deposition and/or damage. 
− After the lens removal, instill sodium fluorescein (unless contraindicated) into the eyes and conduct a thorough biomicroscopy examination. 
○ The pr esence of vertical corneal striae in the posterior central cornea and/or corneal 
neovascularization may be indicative of excessive corneal edema.  
○ The presence of corneal staining and/or limbal -conjunctival hyperemia can be 
indicative of an unclean lens, a reaction to solution preservatives, excessive lens wear, and/or a poorly fitting lens. 
○ Papi[INVESTIGATOR_615555]/or damaged lens. If any of the above observations are judged abnormal, various professional judgments are necessary to alleviate the problem and restore the eye to optimal conditions.  
MULTIFOCAL FITTING GUIDELINES

WEARING SCHEDULE  
The wearing and daily disposable schedules should be determined by [CONTACT_288820]. Regular checkups, as determined by [CONTACT_288820], are extremely important. 
Daily Disposable: There may be a tendency for the daily disposable subject to over -wear the lenses initially. 
Therefore, the importance of adhering to a proper, initial daily disposable schedule should be 
stressed to these subjects. The wearing schedule should be determined by [CONTACT_288820]. The wearing schedule chosen by [CONTACT_842431]. The lens is to be prescribed for single- use disposable wear and is to be replaced after each removal.  
All subjects should be supplied with a copy of the Subject Instructions. 
 HANDLING OF LENSES  
When lenses are dispensed, the subject should be provided with appropriate and adequate 
instructions and warnings for lens handling. The eye care professional should recommend appropriate and adequate procedures for each individual subject in accordance with the particular lens-wearing schedule. 
 
Study #916 - Protocol   
Amendment 1 29 NOVEMBER 2022  Page 84 of 84 CARE FOR A STICKING (NONMOVING) LENS  
If the lens sticks (stops moving), the subject should use a solution intended to lubricate or rewet a 
contact [CONTACT_13293], as recommend by [CONTACT_506800] .  The subject should be instructed to not 
use plain water, or anything other than the recommended solutions. The subject should be 
instructed to contact [CONTACT_842432], and to not attempt to remove the lens except on the advice 
of the eye care professional.

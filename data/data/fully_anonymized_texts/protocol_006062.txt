 2.0 Introductio n 
Scientific Rationale and Significance  
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic progressive autoimmune disease of the central 
nervous system (CNS), and the most common neurologic disease of young adults 
including Veterans. More  than 2.[ADDRESS_723547] a progressive MS (PMS) 
phenotype characterized by [CONTACT_550790] (1). Mobility deficits are a hallmark of MS with 
approximately half of all patients requiring a walking aid by 15 years after diagnosis . MS 
is divided into subtypes according to its course. About 85% people present with a 
relapsing -remitting MS (RRMS) subtype, then transition into a s econdary progressive 
subtype (SPMS) after 10 -20 years. The remaining 10 -15% present with unremitting 
progression from onset called primary progressive MS (PPMS) (2). Taken together , 
PPMS and SPMS are termed progressive MS (PMS). Patients with PM S, including 
veterans, use a disproportionate quantity of social and medical services, and report a 
lower quality of life than RRMS (3). 
MS is traditi onally considered an inflammatory disorder characterized by [CONTACT_14198][INVESTIGATOR_550768]. Neurodegeneration causes generalized atrophy 
throughout the CNS including  the brain, spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831], and optic nerves (4-6). Atrophy of 
both the brain and spi[INVESTIGATOR_550769] -
processing techniques (7). Targeting specific mechanisms of neurodegeneration is a 
rational strategy for development and validation of therapeutic interventions for PMS.  
Lipoic acid (LA) is an endogenously -produced eight carbon sulfur -containing fatty acid 
that is synthes ized de novo in plants and animals. Endogenous LA is bound to pro teins 
and is involved in acyl transfer reactions (8). It can also be absorbed from natural food 
sources and nutritional supplements. LA and its reduced form dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA) 
form a redox couple serves as a cofac tor for at least five enzymes. LA in addition has 
antioxidant fun ctions including free -radical scavenging, metallic ion chelation, 
regeneration of intracellular glutathione, and repair of oxidative damage to 
macromolecules (9). In mitochondria, the LA/DHLA redox couple serves as a key co -
factor for the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex of oxidative respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], and aids 
synthesis of nucleic acid s (10). LA is involved in modulation of signal transduction 
including the PKB/Akt signaling pathway important for vascular endothelial integrity, 
redox -sensitiv e transcription factors including Nrf2, and acts as an insulin mi metic to 
reduce insulin resistance (11, 12) . LA is available as an inexpensive dietary 
 VA Central IRB Protocol Template – version 10/26/[ADDRESS_723548] shown that LA reduces impairment in a dose -dependent 
fashion in the murine model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) 
(13, 14). Our center has also shown that LA is safe and tolerated in people with MS, 
and conducted dose -finding pharmacokinetic (PK) studies. O ral administration of LA at 
1200 mg/day produces easily detectable blood levels in people with MS and achieves 
level s comparable to therapeutic blood levels in mice with EAE (15). The same dose of 
LA has been used in trials for diabetic polyneuropathy and shown to be well -tolerated in 
two year trials for this indication (16). The most common adverse reactions in LA trials 
are gastrointestinal intolerance, headache, malodourous urine, and rash (16, 17) . One 
participant in our Center’s prior clinical t rial of LA in secondary progressive MS and one 
in the currently ongoing study developed biopsy -proven membranous 
glomerulonephritis  (18). Both participants developed urine protein and limb edema 
leading to the diagnosis. At [ADDRESS_723549] care. This participant is under 
ongoing care monitoring.  
We discovered that LA significantly reduced brain atrophy in people with SPMS 
compared to placebo in our  pi[INVESTIGATOR_373962] ( RCT, see Preliminary 
studies) (18). The natural antioxidant, LA, produced a significant reduction in brain 
atrophy assessed by [CONTACT_550791] (SPMS).  
Additionally, the LA cohort had a trend toward improvement in walkin g tests and a 
reduction in falls. Importantly, LA was safe, well tolerated, and had very high 
compliance.  
Significance : The impressive results of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_550770], 
safe, natural, and tolerated DMT candidate for people who suffer from PMS. The goal of 
this larger, multi -site, Phase  [ADDRESS_723550] of LA in a broader PMS population is to confirm the 
effects on brain atrophy rate reduction and 
to establish the clinical benefits of LA.  
Preliminary Studies  
LA suppresses EAE, the animal m odel of 
MS, in a dose -dependent fashion. In a 
study of EAE mice treated with LA before 
disease onset, LA in doses of 100 
mg/kg/day, 50 mg/kg/day, and 20 
mg/kg/day were all effective in Fig. 1. Dose -response curve of EAE 
suppression in LA -treated mice.  
 VA Central IRB Protocol Template – version 10/26/2012  Page 12 of 48 
 
Figure 4. LA reduces brain atrophy in 
SPMS partic ipants using intention -to-
treat analysis.  suppressing EAE (19). An LA dose of 20 mg/kg/day suppressed EAE development by 
[CONTACT_34120] 50%  (according to Cumulative Disease Scores scores), a dose of 50 mg/kg/day 
suppressed EAE by ~80%, and a dose of 100 mg/kg/day suppressed EAE by 100% 
over 10 days (Fig.1).  
PK studies in EAE and humans have determined the human equivalent dose to the 
therape utically effective dose in EAE. Two PK studies of LA in people with MS were 
conducted at OHSU and determined that doses of 1200mg taken with food were easily 
detectable LA  levels in the serum and had reasonable gastrointestinal tolerability (15, 
17). A formulation from the PK studies was used in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_550771].  
Spain et al conducted a single -center, 2 -year 
randomized, double -blind, placebo -controll ed 
phase 2 trial (n=51) of daily oral LA in SPMS 
(18). The LA cohort demonstrated a 68% 
reduction in the annualized rate of whole 
brain atrophy (0.21% vs -0.65%, p = 0.002, 
Fig 4). Although not powered to detect 
clinical outcomes, the LA cohort had a trend 
toward improv emen t in walking speed in the 
T25FW ( -0.54 SD 0.36 vs 0.14 SD 0.25, p = 
0.06). Overall LA was safe and well tolerated 
with high compliance and  at the time,  no 
unexpected deleterious adverse events (AE) 
were attributed to LA.  A later review of AE’s 
in light of safety data emerging from the 
present study indicate that the serious 
adverse event of biopsy -proven glomeru lonephritis  and a second case of proteinuria  in  
subject s in the LA cohort was  related to lipoic acid (see above).  To date, all three cases 
resolved  within a 3-12 month period.  Gastrointestinal (GI) upset was significantly 
greater in the LA cohort compared to placebo (17% v 3% p = 0.004). Unexpectedly, the 
LA cohort had a significantly lower number of falls than the placebo cohort (15% v 38%, 
p = 0.03 ). The results of this study formed the basis of the current research trial.  
3.0 Objectives  
Hypothesis:   The purpose of this study is  to determine if the oral antioxidant LA provides 
clinical benefits and reduces brain atrophy in PMS. The hypothesis is  that d aily LA will 
both maintain mobility and reduce whole brain atrophy, thus pavin g the way for 
 VA Central IRB Protocol Template – version 10/26/[ADDRESS_723551] of 1200mg oral daily LA versus placebo in PMS are: 
Specific A im 1. Determine if LA is superior to placebo in maintaining mobility as 
measured by [CONTACT_550792] 25 Foot 
Walk (T25FW). Secondary outcomes are changes in the 2 Minute Timed Walk (2MTW) 
and fall count for cons istency of the effects of LA on mobility.  
 
Specific Aim 2. Determine if LA is superior to placebo in slowing whole brain atrophy 
with an estimated 40 -50%% effect size. Additional secondary outcome measures are 
changes in neurological disability, cognition , mood, and quality of life.  
 
Specific Aim 3. Monitor safety and tolerability via laboratory testing and adverse event 
reporting.

5.0 Study Procedures  
5.1 Study Design  
5.1a.  Design and specific aims:  This is a phase [ADDRESS_723554]  to 
compare the daily administration of 1200 mg oral LA to a placebo, as a disease -
modifying  treatment in PMS. A total of 118 subjects with PMS will be randomized 1:1 to 
LA or placebo. None of the study procedures involve usual care. All study procedures 
will be covered by [CONTACT_550793].  
5.1b.  Study population : A convenience sample of adults with  PMS will be recruited 
from the study sites. The multi -site design of the trial is intended to promote 
generalizability of the study results.  
5.1c.  Study timeline and visit scheduling.  The anticipated study recruitment period is for 
the first [ADDRESS_723555] participant exits the 
study. There should be no more than 60 days inclusive between the screen and 
baseline visits. S ubsequent study visits will occur at 3 months, 6 months, and every 6 
months thereafter, each visit within +/ - 2 weeks from the ideal visit based on the 
baseline/ month zero (M0) visit. The MRI can take place up to 2 weeks prior to the 
baseline and final vis its. Should the final MRI be postponed for any reason until after the 
 VA Central IRB Protocol Template – version 10/26/[ADDRESS_723556] udy days. Study visits will be scheduled at the same time -period 
each visit (morning versus afternoon). Study visits may be postponed for concurrent 
non-MS related illness affecting neurological performance on the discretion of the 
treating neurologist.  
 
5.1d. Unscheduled visits for relapse evaluation and adverse events (AE):  Unscheduled 
visits will occur in the event of MS clinical relapses or investigations of AE of at least 
moderate severity considered directly related to the study drug or study procedur es. 
The unscheduled visit for AE is for the purpose of evaluation by [CONTACT_38296], 
documentation, and reporting according to IRB guidelines. If sufficient medical 
documentation by [CONTACT_550794], or if t he 
symptoms had resolved by [CONTACT_550795], the treating neurologist may use the 
medical documentation or telephone interview in lieu of an unscheduled visit. 
Asymptomatic elevations or depression in laboratory values considered related to the 
inves tigational drug do not require an unscheduled visit but instead follow the 
monitoring procedure (5.1m. Protection from risks).  If AEs warranting an unscheduled 
visit are noted during a scheduled study visit, procedures for both the unscheduled visit 
for A E and the scheduled study visit are completed. An unscheduled visit for AE 
evaluation includes  collection of case report forms for :  
 AE evaluation documentation including event history  
 General m edical exam  
 Vital signs  
 Concomitant medications  
 Safety la boratory measures (per treating neurologist discretion)  
 Adverse events monitoring  
 SBQ -R 
A protocol -defined MS clinical relapse is defined as new or recurrent neurological 
symptoms, not associated with fever or infection, lasting for at least 24 hours, w hich is 
 VA Central IRB Protocol Template – version 10/26/2012  Page 17 of 48 
 followed by a period of stability or improvement. In addition, a protocol -defined relapse 
requires an increase in the EDSS Functional System corresponding  to the symptom(s) 
of the relapse, or an increase in the overall EDSS secondary to a functiona l change 
related to symptoms(s) of the relapse. A relapse is not considered an adverse event. 
MS c linical relapses can occur in PMS and may be treated by [CONTACT_550796] s of 
less than 2 weeks duration.  
An unscheduled visit should be conducted within 1 week of a reported MS clinical 
relapse. The unscheduled visit for MS clinical relapse evaluation includes:  
 MS clinical relapse evaluation documentation including  
 General medical exam  
 Vital signs  
 Concomitant medications  
 EDSS examination (blinded)  
 Safety laboratory measures (per treating neurologist discretion)   
 Adverse events monitoring  
 SBQ -R 
Subjects who have discontinued the investigational drug for adverse events including 
laboratory monitoring (see section 5.1m.) do not require unscheduled visits for 
subsequent MS clinical relapses.  
Scheduled study visits involving MRIs will be delayed for at least [ADDRESS_723557] procedures for both the 
unscheduled visit for MS clinical relapse and the scheduled study visit completed.  
Subjects who withdraw early from the study follow the procedures outlined in 
Withdrawal of Subjects (sec 5.7).  
 5.1e.  Source of investigational drug.  Pure Encapsulations®, which follows Good 
Manufacturing Pr ocedures in their production of LA, will provide gelatin capsules 
 VA Central IRB Protocol Template – version 10/26/2012  Page 18 of 48 
 containing 600 mg of LA and the encapsulated placebo rendered to appear similar to LA 
(Letter of support, Appendix A).  
5.1f.  Investigational New Drug (IND).  [CONTACT_550853] holds an IND for test ing LA in PMS 
(#110132). The current proposed study has been  added as an amendment to the 
current IND. Reporting requirements to the FDA will be followed.  
5.1g.  Labeling:  The investigational product will have a label that will be visible on the 
pertinent s torage containers. The label or labeling of an investigational new drug shall 
not bear any statement that is false or misleading in any particular and shall not 
represent that the investigational new drug is safe or effective for the purposes for which 
it is being investigated.   
5.1h.   Blinding . Blinding of the investigational drug will be implemented by [CONTACT_550797], and instructions. The Central Research 
Pharmacy will maintain a master record of subject assignmen t. Subjects and all 
personnel involved in conducting the trial will remain blinded to treatment assignment 
and undergo a blinding questionnaire at study end.  
 
5.1i.  Duration of treatment:  Treatment with study drug will be for [ADDRESS_723558] 
packaging and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  
5.1k.   Compliance  and medication reconciliation : Compliance with taking the 
investigational drug will be encouraged at each visit and between visits by [CONTACT_550798]. Unused pi[INVESTIGATOR_550774], by [CONTACT_550799]. The study site research pharmacies will conduct medication reconciliation with 
returned pi[INVESTIGATOR_550775] 75% or more than 125% of prescribed doses to encourage proper compliance.  
5.1l. Risks:  Risks of the investigational drug, study procedures, and potential loss of 
confidentiality are reviewed with potential subjects during the informed consent process. 
Risks, reporting, responses to risks, an d methods to minimize risks are further outlined 
in section 6.0, Reporting and 7.0, Privacy and Confidentiality. Briefly, risks of the 
 VA Central IRB Protocol Template – version 10/26/2012  Page 19 of 48 
 investigational drug are minimized by [CONTACT_550800]. Risks of study proced ures are minimized by [CONTACT_550801]. Risks of loss of confidentiality are minimized 
by [CONTACT_550802], limiting access of PHI to the minimum necessary study 
staff, and use of secure data transfer metho ds. 
Risks of LA: Oral LA can cause physical side effects including gastrointestinal (GI) 
intolerance, nausea and vomiting and rash. LA may cause liver, renal and urinary 
disorders. There is a possibility of developi[INVESTIGATOR_550776]/or membranous 
glomerul onephritis due to study drug.  It is not known how LA could affect a fetus. LA 
may increase the risk of hypoglycemia in diabetics. The risks of LA taken with DMTs or 
with alcohol are unknown.  
Risks of study procedures and loss of confidentiality: There is a risk of falls and injury 
during gait testing. The MRI magnet can cause metal in the body to move, heat, and 
cause injury. The MRI space is small, so those with claustrophobia are at risk of 
discomfort during the study. There is a risk of psychological ha rm from incidental 
findings unrelated to the study found on MRI such as brain tumors, stroke, other. The 
risks of blood draws include discomfort, vasovagal syncope, bleeding, bruising, and 
infection. The risks of clinical testing and patient -reported outco me measures include 
psychological discomfort from discovering or reporting deficits due to MS. There is a risk 
of loss of confidentiality of the study data.  
5.1m.  Protection from risks:  The informed consent process will inform potential subjects 
of the ris ks of participation. The study will be conducted with IRB  oversight. Procedures 
in this study were specifically designed to minimize risks to the subjects. The 
investigators will adhere to the Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  (sec. 6.2) . Trained 
study perso nnel will perform all data collection, and information will be coded with a 
subject identifier to protect subject confidentiality. Findings that could affect the subjects’ 
health or welfare will be reported to the appropriate authorities (e.g. IRB) and 
communicated to the subjects and appropriate medical service (s) which could include 
the primary care physician.  
Risks to subjects from LA will be minimized by [CONTACT_550803], reviewing medical histories and medications at each s tudy visit for potential 
interactions with the investigational drug, reviewing AEs for relation to investigational 
drug, and requiring unscheduled visits for AE evaluation and management.  
To minimize the possible GI side effects of oral LA, we recommend s ubjects take the 
investigational drug with food, or if necessary, to divide the daily dose, or the dose 
 VA Central IRB Protocol Template – version 10/26/2012  Page 20 of 48 
 reduced by 50% at the discretion of the treating neurologist.  Serum renal panels and 
urinalyses will  monitor for kidney damage at every visit.  
Trained phlebotomists will perform blood draws to minimize the associated risks of 
blood draws. Safety  monitoring laboratory panels will monitor for liver, kidney, and 
hematological problems, pregnancy for women of childbearing potential and changes in 
HbA1c.   
a. Proteinuria monitoring : Subjects  must have urine protein monitored every [ADDRESS_723559] pause  study drug if they 
skip or miss a visit until draw can occur.   
Subjects with baseline (screening) negative or trace proteinu ria may participate 
in the s tudy. Subjects with baseline  1+ or higher proteinuria are further  tested for 
albumin to creatinine ratio (ACR): 1) ACR ≤ 300mg/g may participate, 2) ACR 
>300mg/g  are excluded and receive referral to PCP . No repeat screening for 
proteinuria in subjects who have ACR  >300 mg/g will be done.  
Subject s who experience 1+ or higher proteinuria during t he study are further  
tested for ACR: 1) ACR ≤ 300mg/g may continue participation , 2) ACR >300mg/g 
permanently stop study drug  and receive referral to PCP  or nephrologist along 
with notification of the Medical Monitor . A referral to Nephrology is recommende d 
if ACR>1000mg/g. A kidney biopsy is recommended if proteinuria  >300  does not 
resolve within 6 weeks of drug cessation . 
b. Renal function monitoring:  Subjects with baseline eGFR  ≥ 60 may participate in 
the study. Subjects with baseline eGFR<5 0 are excluded.  Subjects with baseline 
eGFR 50 -59.9 are retested : 1) eGFR  ≥ 60 may participate in the study , 2) 
eGFR<6 0 are excluded.   
Subjects who experience eGFR 50 -59.9 during the study are retested within  1 
month: 1) eGFR  ≥ 60 may continue participation in the study , 2) eGFR<6 0 
permanently stop study drug and are referred to PCP . Subjects who experience 
eGFR< 50 during the study permanently stop study drug  and referred to PCP . 
Regardless of the eGFR, if the eGFR decreases by 25% or more compared to 
the baseline eGFR, t he Medical Monitor should be notified and should review the 
information to determine the next course of action.    
c. Liver function monitoring : Abnormal  liver laboratory results are graded according 
to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v5.0 
(https://ctep.cancer.gov/protocoldevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm ). 
 VA Central IRB Protocol Template – version 10/26/[ADDRESS_723560] stable and asymptomatic baseline Grade 1 abnormal 
laboratory liver values may, at the discretion of the site treating neurologists, 
participate in the study. Subjects who experience  laboratory abnormalities of 
Grade 1 during the study will be permitted to continue at the full dose  of study 
drug unless advised otherwise by [CONTACT_550804] .  
Abnormal l aboratory tests may be repeated immediately if laboratory testing error 
is suspected. Laboratory tests should be repeated within 1 month for any liver  
values reaching a Grade 2  or greater .  
If laboratory liver value(s) are still Grade 2 or greater by  1 month, the 
investigational drug will be reduced by 50% and levels checked again within 1 
month. The rationale is that liver -related abnormalities are often dose -dependent. 
If laboratory liver value(s) improve to Grade 1 or less , the study drug dose is then 
increased to the full dose. If the same subsequent laboratory value(s) worsen 
again at the full dose, the subject may continue for the study duration at the 50% 
dose as long as subsequent laboratory values do  not meet Grade 2 or greater 
levels . If subjects on a 50% dose demonstrate continued Grade 2  value(s) at a 
maximum of [ADDRESS_723561] permanently 
discontinue the investigational drug . If in question, permanent study drug 
discontinuations can be discussed with the Medical Monitor to establish the 
relationship of the laboratory result to the investigational drug. Subjects continue 
study procedures following the study flowsheet until stu dy end during any 
investigational drug dose reductions  and temporary  cessations (see 5.1d for 
special handling of MS clinical relapse evaluations).  
Safety laboratory results will be reviewed by [CONTACT_550805] 3 business 
days to determin e if dose adjustments or safety reporting is required along with 
documentation and reporting as required  (section 6.0 Reporting) . 
Sexually active female subjects capable of becoming pregnant and female partners of 
sexually active male subjects will be aske d to use effective birth control during the 
study. If a female participant or partner of a male participant becomes pregnant during 
the research study, study personnel must be notified immediately. Subjects will be 
advised not to breastfeed while taking th is investigational drug. Screening for pregnancy 
in female subjects of child -bearing potential will be conducted via pregnancy tests at 
study visits.  
 VA Central IRB Protocol Template – version 10/26/[ADDRESS_723562]’s continued 
participation in the study, and to fulfil any reporting requirements necessary. Site 
treating neurologists will coun sel subjects with unexpected findings on MRI to minimize 
any psychological trauma incurred by [CONTACT_550806].  
Overall, the risks of LA are considered minimal and are outweighed by [CONTACT_550807].  
5.1n.  Data banking : MRI an d images and analyses results along with subject 
demographics and medical histories will be banked in the VAPORHCS Biorepository for 
Neurological Diseases (BND #2916). The only PHI included in the data repository is the 
date of study visit. These dates are  necessary for the proper identification of images 
and data in subjects with multiple data entry points. The banking of the images is 
described in the Informed Consent Form (ICF).  
5.1o. Optional biorepository p articipation : All subjects who have consented to the 
LAPMS study will be asked if they would like to contribute their blood to the 
Biorepository for Neurological Diseases  (BND)  #2916 (Rebecca Spain, director , 
Portland, OR ). If the subject consents  to the blood donation, approximately 10ml (2 
teaspoons ) of the blood collected a t each study visit requiring a routine lab draw  will be  
saved for storage in the BND indefinitely for future research . A coded data set including  
study ID, date of specimen collection , study visit, sex, age at time of blood draw, 
education, diagnosis, dis ease duration, study arm, and comorbid health conditions is 
 VA Central IRB Protocol Template – version 10/26/[ADDRESS_723563] their blood included in the biorepository.  
5.2 Recruitment Methods  
5.2a.  Recruitment goal:  A total of 118 subjects will be recr uited for the study which 
include s an expected 25% will -drop rate out after enrolment. More potential subjects will 
be screened than enrolled as it is expected that some will not meet eligibility 
requirements despi[INVESTIGATOR_550777]. The PM and DCC will monitor recruitment 
across study sites and provide feedback on when enrolment is complete in order to stop 
recruitment (see Communication Plan 8.0).  Recruitment data and reasons for failing to 
enroll in the study will be collected periodically from all stu dy sites for the purpose of 
encouraging enrolment and identifying barriers to participation.  
5.2b.  Subject Identification/Recruitment : Potential subjects for the study will be recruited 
by [CONTACT_550808]’s local Institutional Review Board (IRB)  and/or a C entral IRB . Sample 
advertisement s recruitment flyers  (Appendix B ), recruitment letters to local MS 
practitioners  (Appendix C ), and telephone scripts for interested Veter ans and non -
veterans (Appendix D ) are provided to each site. E mail blasts to potential subjects will 
be sent from the National MS Society using the approved language contained in the 
recruitment flyers and letters  (Appendix E ). The NMSS promote s the study by [CONTACT_550809] a 
webpage including a study summary , site locations,  and study coordinator contact 
[CONTACT_3031].  A short URL  (Appendix X), linking to the NMSS webpage, may be 
distributed during media interviews, and added to promotion materials  (Appendix Y) 
during MS related  events, such as but not limited to, MS Walks, MS races, and MS 
support groups.  ResearchMatch.org will be used as one of the recruitment tools for this 
research study/protocol. ResearchMatch Volunteers will be contact[CONTACT_550810].o rg using the approved language contained in the  recruitment message 
(Appendix W ). A release of information will be obtained as needed to request medical 
records for eligibility review prior to scheduling screening visits. Participants enrolled in 
the North  American Research Committee on Multiple Sclerosis ( NARCOMS ) registry for 
Multiple Sclerosis will receive an approved study flyer in the mail. As with other 
recruitment tools, a release of information will be obtained as needed to request medical 
 VA Central IRB Protocol Template – version 10/26/[ADDRESS_723564]. Rebecca Spain’s MS Research Repository (IRB#[ZIP_CODE]). This 
repository contains names and contact [CONTACT_550811]. All subjects included in the repository have consented to bein g contact[CONTACT_550812]. Initial contact [CONTACT_550813]. The CCC will also work with the Recru itment 
Innovation Center (RIC) at Vanderbilt University to implement a [ADDRESS_723565] in MS.  Examples and text  of the 
components within the social media ad campaign include the Facebook page (Appendix 
Z), the Facebook Ads (Appendix  AA), and the study webpage (Appendix BB) and 
content (Appendix CC) , adhering to  the VA Graphic Standa rds Guide.  
5.2c.  Recruitment of specific subpopulations.  MS has a predilection for affecting 
women in a 3 -4:[ADDRESS_723566] of LA on specific minority 
populations and/or with particul ar genetic characteristics. MS is rare in children, and 
progressive forms of MS rare within this small population. Therefore no children will be 
enrolled.  
5.2d.  Recruitment of Veterans : The pi[INVESTIGATOR_550778] 21 Veterans from the 
total 51 subjects . The current proposed study has more restrictive inclusion criteria than 
the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], requiring that subjects are ambulatory. Recruitment of non -Veterans and 
use of VA and non -VA study sites is necessary to fulfil the enrolment timeline.  
5.2e.  Sources  of materials : Sources from human subjects will include blood and urine 
samples and data in the form of clinical tests (e.g. gait, neurologic exam), patient -
reported outcomes, and radiographic information (MRI). Medical records will be 
reviewed prior to th e screening visit to assess for eligibility and confirm MS diagnosis. 
Data will be collected solely for research purposes.  
5.2f. Benefits:  Subjects may or may not benefit directly from the study. The benefits to 
society may be the discovery of a safe and  low-cost oral therapy to treat PMS.  
5.2g.  Costs to subjects:  There will be no cost to subjects to participate in this study. 
The study drug and investigations will be covered by [CONTACT_97681].  
 VA Central IRB Protocol Template – version 10/26/[ADDRESS_723567] compensation:  Subjects will receive $50 per visit including unscheduled 
visits and $25 for extra laboratory visits if needed and cannot be performed locally. In 
addition, subjects are compensated for travel with $0.50/mile over 30 miles up to a 
maximum of $100 per visit. The payments will be in the form approved by [CONTACT_550814], and will cover the costs of transportation and meals during the study visits. 
The compensation is included in the ICF. Subjects will be provided compensation after 
each visit regardless if all procedures are complete d. 
5.3 Informed Consent Procedures  
Subjects will be required to sign IRB - approved ICFs  in accordance with FDA Code of 
Federal Regulations (21 CFR 50). The ICF will be presented to all potential subjects at 
the screening visit by [CONTACT_550815] . Briefly, the ICF describes the purpose of the study, 
procedures and participant involvement, potential risks, protection against risks, 
alternatives to participation, costs and compensation, confidentiality, right to withdraw, 
potential benefits, relevant contact [CONTACT_6404], and new information regarding the Health 
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. Potential subjects will have ample 
time to read and ask questions, and, when satisfied, will document their consent to 
participate by [CONTACT_12568]. A copy of the ICF is given to the participant and the other 
retained for study records. All subjects must be able to provide informed consent in 
English.  Potential subjects with impa ired decision making ability will not be included in 
the study as they may not be able to adhere to study procedures per the eligibility 
requirements.

5.5b.  Consent, medical history, general medical exam : The ICF will be presented by 
[CONTACT_978], LSI, or designated study staff. After consent has been obtained, the rest of the 
study procedures can occur. The medical history  and general medical exam is 
conducted by [CONTACT_550817].  
5.5c.  Vital signs:  Resting blood pressure, pulse, and weight are collected by [CONTACT_550818] y and ongoing health 
monitoring. Consistent methods of obtaining data (e.g. same resting period prior to 
blood pressure and pulse assessments, etc.) is encouraged across study visits. Height 
is assessed at the screening visit only.  
5.5d.  Concomitant medica tion review:  Current use of prescribed scheduled and as 
needed medications as well as over the counter medications and supplements is 
recorded by [CONTACT_550819]. Concomitan t medications are reviewed at each subsequent visit by 
[CONTACT_550820]. Any start, stop, or change 
to MS disease -modifying therapi[INVESTIGATOR_550780]. 
Supplements will be review ed by [CONTACT_550821].  
5.5e.   Safety laboratory analyses:  Laboratory studies will be collected from all subjects 
at the screening visit if not available within the prior 3 months for establishing eligibility. 
Additional laboratory analyses occur at visits M3, M6, M12, M18 and M24 to monitor 
blood cell count, renal function, liver function, urine protein, non -fasting blood glucose 
levels, HbA1c, and (for women of child -bearin g potential) pregnancy testing.  Subjects  
must have urine protein monitored every 3 months for the duration of the study .  
Pregnancy testing is additionally conducted at the baseline visit for women of child -
bearing potential. This involves taking approxima tely 15 -25 mL (3 to 5 teaspoons) of 
blood at each draw for a total of 90 -150mL (2/3 cup) over the course of the study. 
Laboratory draws will be performed by [CONTACT_550822].  
5.5f. Inclusion/Exclusion review:  Eligibility cr iteria are reviewed by [CONTACT_550823]. Once all criteria are met  and confirmed at the 
baseline visit , the study staff will use REDCap to assign a randomization code and  then 
 VA Central IRB Protocol Template – version 10/26/[ADDRESS_723576]  screens 
who do not meet inclusion/exclusion requirements will be accounted for in the 
recruitment monitoring process (See 5.2 Recruitment Methods).  
5.5g.   Walking tests.  The T25FW  and 2MTW  will be collected at the screening and 
baseline visits, and every 6 months during the study (21, 22) . For the T25FW, subjects 
are instructed to walk 25 feet marked on the ground “quickly but safely” (Appendi x F). 
The measure is immediately repeated and th e two results averaged. Assistive walking 
devices including canes and walkers are permitted. The 2MTW determines the distance 
a participant walks in 2 minutes. Dalfampridine is an FDA -approved symptomatic 
treatment for improving walking speed in MS. Subjec ts will be asked to maintain their 
usual dose of dalfampridine at all study visits . Subjects will be strongly encouraged to 
use the same assistive devices (insoles, orthotics, canes, walkers, etc.) if used at the 
study start throughout the remainder of the  study as safely possible. Subjects who 
become unable to complete the mobility testing during the course of the study due to 
worsening MS will continue the study and be analyzed as having worsening mobility 
according to the data analysis plan. Subjects who  are unable to complete mobility 
testing for non -MS related reasons will not have data recorded for that study visit. 
Because gait testing is the primary outcome measure, subjects should be tested as 
early as possible during each study visit. Testing condi tions should be as uniform as 
possible from visit to visit (see 5.1 Study Design, Study timeline and visit scheduling).  
5.5h.   EDSS: The EDSS is an eight functional system scale to assess overall MS 
disability including motor, sensory, cerebellar, brain s tem, visual, mental, sphincteric, 
and other systems (24). Each functional system is graded  from 0 (no disability) to 5 or 6 
(maximal disability). An integrated score between 0 (normal examination) and 10 (death 
from MS) is formed based on the score in each functional system. The EDSS exam will 
be performed by a blinded and trained EDSS examiner  who is not the subject’s usual 
treating neurologist (Appendix G ). 
5.5i.  9HPT:  The [ADDRESS_723577] (9HPT) is a timed test of upper extremity arm and 
hand function. Subjects place pegs into a platform with hole and then take them out 
again (Appendix F). The 9HPT and T25FW will be administered in accordance with the 
instructions for the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (21). 
5.5j.  Cognitive tests : Cognitive testing will utilize the Brief International Cognitive 
Assessm ent for MS (BICAMS (25) which includes  the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (26) 
(Appendix H ), the [LOCATION_004] Verbal Learning Test - Second Edition (27) (Appendix I ), 
 VA Central IRB Protocol Template – version 10/26/[ADDRESS_723578] - Revised (28) (Appendix J ). These measures  
will be assessed at baseline, M12 and M24.  
5.5k.   Patient -reported outcome measures:  The Patient Reported Outcome Measures 
Information Systems (PROMIS) will pain intensity  (Appendix K ), pain interference  
(Appendix L ), and ability to participate in social roles (Appendix M ) (29). Additional 
measures of depression (Patient Health Questionnaire -9, Appendix N ), sleep the 
previous 4 weeks (Sleep Scale from the Medical Outcomes Study , Appendix O ), 
exercise (Godin Leisure -Time Exercise Questionnaire , modified , Appendix V),  and the 
Modified Fatigue impact Scale  (Appendix P) will be administered at baseline and every 
6 months thereafter (30, 31) .  The Fall Efficacy Scale -International (FESI) (Appendix T ) 
is administered annually.  
5.5l.  Fall count : Fall count will be kept by a daily Fall Count Diary (Appendix Q). Each 
calendar page will cover 1 month and will include space to count falls and fall -related 
injuries each day. Each page wil l include the definition of a fall as “any unexpected 
event that results in you ending up on the ground, floor, or any lower surface” (23). At 
the baseline visit, subjects will be given calendars to cover the first [ADDRESS_723579] the opportunity to answer any fall counting related questions. A final 
3 month supply of falls calendars will be mailed before the end of the study with a target 
start date on the calendar corr esponding to 3 months prior to the final study visit. 
Subjects will again be called once to encourage compliance and answer any related 
questions.  
5.5m.  MRI procedures .  
a. MRI acquisition protocol:  A 3T MRI will be utilized to acquire the following series 
of the brain. 1. A high resolution Magnetization Prepared Rapid Acquisition 
Gradient Echo (MPRAGE) for high resolution structural (T1 -weighted) 
information, as the basis for brain atrophy measures. Partitions will be 1.0 mm; 
voxels 1 mm3. 2. Conventional bra in imaging with T2 -weighted, and FLAIR 
series; 2mm (non -gapped) slice acquisition, with in plane resolution 1mm2. 
Intravascular MR contrast will not be administered. 3. The American College of 
Radiology phantom scan will be utilized as necessary for qualit y control. The 
imaging procedure will require 60 minutes with approximately 30 minutes 
participant scan acquisition time, 10 minute phantom scan acquisition time (when 
needed), and the remaining 20 minutes for positioning and questions. Careful 
screening o f subjects prior to MRI will be done to reduce the chance of injury due 
to MRI -contraindicated conditions.  
b. MRI clinical readings.  MRIs will receive a clinical read from site clinical radiology 
staff and results reviewed by [CONTACT_550824] – version 10/26/2012  Page 32 of 48 
 (tumor, stroke, etc.) which, if found, will be communicated to the appropriate 
clinical service for optimal management including treatment of MS exacerbations.  
c. MRI volumetric analyses:  MRI analyses used for study outcomes will be 
analyzed  by [CONTACT_550825]. MRI images are sent to the 
Reading Site via secure methods. Prior to analyses, AIRC staff will ensure that 
only the study ID and PHI element of date of study visit are visible to the analysts 
to reduce any bias. Brain volume measures will be based on SIENAX software 
and brain atrophy measures on SIENNA tools in the FSL software library 
produced by [CONTACT_550826] (32). Total brain 
T2-hyperint ense lesions will be determined using in -house software. In -house 
and FSL software will be used to explore differential gray versus white matter 
atrophy as an exploratory MRI outcome measure. Study MRIs will be reviewed 
for quality within [ADDRESS_723580]  ([ADDRESS_723581] per MRI visit permitted) if needed w ithin an acceptable time -frame.  
d. MRI quality control (QC):  In order to ensure high quality and comparable images 
across study sites, the Central MRI Reading Site will coordinate QC by [CONTACT_550827]. In addition, each site will conduct 
standard phantom scan according to protocols set by [CONTACT_550828]. Feedback from the Central MRI Reading Site staff to the study sites 
regarding test, phantom QC, and study MRIs will occur in a timely manner so that 
errors can be fixed promptly.  
5.5n.   Suicidality monitoring:  Monitoring suicidality is a requirement by [CONTACT_550829]. Monitoring using the with 
the Suicide Behaviors Questionnaire -Revised  (SBQ -R) occurs at the screen to establish 
a baseline and every subsequent study visit to eva luate for the developmen t of new 
suicidality (Appendix R). 
5.5o.  Adverse event (AE) monitoring:  This occurs at baseline, every subsequent visit, 
at between visit telephone calls, and ad hoc . Unscheduled visits will occur to evaluate 
AE per the protocol gui delines (sec. 5.1d). AE are coded by [CONTACT_550830] (sec. 6.0).  
Subjects will be encouraged to remain in the study through study completion if they 
start, stop, or switch a DMT, if their disability pro gresses due to MS to an EDSS of more 
than 6.5, or if they have an MS relapse. Subjects who develop MRI contraindications 
may continue through the study end without further MRIs. Study staff will review 
eligibility at study visits and during regularly sched uled meetings.  
 VA Central IRB Protocol Template – version 10/26/2012  Page 33 of 48 
 5.5p.   Investigational drug dispens ing: Drug dispens ing occurs at baseline and every 
study visit according to dispens ing schedules by [CONTACT_550831].  
5.5q.   Subject/provider blinding questionnaire:  All blinded study staff and s ubjects take 
a blinding questionnaire at M24 to evaluate the blind  (Appendix S). 
5.5r. Subject disposition form : Final disposition of each subject is recorded on this form 
at the M24, early termination visit, or when determined that the subject is unable t o 
attend an early termination visit.  
5.6 Data Analysis  
5.6a.  Sample size : The sample size and power analysis were based on the pi[INVESTIGATOR_550781] T25FW ( -0.54 seconds SD 
0.36 vs 0.14 SD 0.25, p = 0.06). A s ample size of [ADDRESS_723582] 80% power to 
detect a difference between the LA group with a coefficient, β [ADDRESS_723583] 
deviation of the residuals (repeated measures within each participant) is 1.80 with a 
0.05 two -sided significance level and the correlation of 0.85 between the measurements 
over time, which if lower increases th e power. The delta of improvement is a reduction 
in the rate of walking slowing of 0.5 seconds per unit of time.  This translates into 2 
seconds on the average timed walk over 2 years.  A sample size of 59 per arm will allow 
for a 25% drop -out rate.  The pi[INVESTIGATOR_48085] t study had a 10% drop out rate however 25% is more 
realistic for a multi -site trial in an era with more therapeutic options for MS. Screen visit 
failures are likely to be minimal (<10% of all screen visits) as most eligibility 
requirements can be made pri or to the screening visit using the methods described in 
5.2 Recruitment Methods.  
As a check on these calculations we compared the estimates, Altmann et al.’s estimates 
of sample size when using SIENA as the method of determining whole brain atrophy 
rate, the current sample of 44 per group will achieve 80% power at significance level 
0.05 assuming a 40 -50% effect size (33).  
5.6b.  Data analysis plan:  Data is analyzed by [CONTACT_550832]. Only subjects that complete the baseline 
evaluation and take at least one dose of study drug will be included in the data 
analysis.  
The SCC  will use the mixed model approach to compare, between the treatment 
groups, mean rates of change  from baseline in the times to complete the T25FW. The 
SCC  will use the transformation 25/T25FW, which is the walking speed in feet per 
 VA Central IRB Protocol Template – version 10/26/[ADDRESS_723584]. Additional models will include as covariates, baseline measures of 
disease duration and use of MS medications if significantly related to the response 
when added to the original model or resu lt in a 10% change or greater in the estimated 
overall treatment effect. Secondarily, the SCC  will compare with a t -test or 
nonparametric tests the proportion of participants who demonstrate clinically significant 
worsening in gait defined by a 20% improve ment in the T25FW and/or 2MTW and/or 
requires greater assistance to walk (e.g. newly require a cane, transition from cane to 
walker, etc.). A sensitivity analyses  will be performed  using an intention to treat analysis 
with the cross -over with and without p articipants who have a change in their disease -
modifying therapy during the course of the study. Compliance information will be added 
as determined by [CONTACT_21173][INVESTIGATOR_4382] -counts to the mixed model.  
The impact of LA on falls frequency will be assessed by [CONTACT_550833] s in fall 
frequency from the first to the last [ADDRESS_723585] repeated measures and allow for missing data, and include covariates 
associated with falling such as age, level of disability, and use of a  walking aid. As 
exploratory secondary outcome measure, the SCC  will investigate the disconjugate 
composite endpoint based on sustained change in EDSS, clinically significant 
worsening in gait as defined above, or 20% increase in 9HPT.  
The mixed model appr oach will compare the mean rates of change from baseline in 
brain as measured by [CONTACT_47795] . Age, sex, and disease duration will be used as covariates 
along with disability.   
Adverse and serious adverse events will be tabulated and compare the differences in 
the occurrence and the frequencies between the two groups. The frequency of side 
effects will be compared using χ2 tests or Fisher’s exact test as appropriate depending 
on the number of adverse events seen.  For evaluation of patient safety, laboratory test 
results at baseline and changes from baseline will be summarized and compared using 
t-tests for continuous measures and Fisher’s exact test for proportions.  
 
 
 VA Central IRB Protocol Template – version 10/26/2012  Page 35 of 48 
 5.7 Withdrawal of Subjects  
Subjects can withdraw from the study at any time. Reason for withdraw al will be recorded. 
Subjects may also be withdrawn from t he study by [CONTACT_550834] [INVESTIGATOR_225428]: 1. New or worsening medical conditions (e .g., cancer, 
renal disease, end -stage cardiopulmonary disease, post -traumatic stress disorder, 
uncontrolled diabetes, etc.) that may interfere with study procedures or otherwise pose 
concern for subject health or safety, 2. New pregnancy, 3. Inability of subjects to comply 
with study procedures, 4. Other reason s deemed import ant to subject safety or data 
quality raised by [CONTACT_4318], IRB, FDA, or any other regulatory body that has the authority 
to do so.  If subjects are deemed no longer safe to take the investigational drug but 
otherwise are able to participate in the study outc omes for the remainder of the study, they 
are encouraged to do so.  
Female study subjects of childbearing potential will be encouraged to use effective birth 
control methods during the study. Pregnancy testing in female subjects of childbearing 
potential wi ll be conducted as part of safety laboratory studies at each study visit according 
to the study flowsheet. Should pregnancies occur during the study, those female subjects 
will be withdrawn from the study. I nformation will be collected as to the pregnancy course, 
outcome and health of the newborn infant. Because LA is available as an over the counter 
supplement, male subjects whose female partners become pregnant will continue in the 
study, however pregnancy and birth outcomes of the female partners will be  recorded and 
presented to the DSMB.  
If a subject wants to withdraw from the study, the subject will contact [CONTACT_550835]. If a 
subject withdraws or is removed from the  study for any reason  and is unable or 
unsuitable to continue the study procedures off investigational drug , the reason and 
date of discontinuation of the investigational drug  is recorded. At the time of study 
discontinuation, every effort will be made to schedule  the subject for an early 
termination visit following the procedures for  M24 without the MRI or F all Count D iary if 
termination is within [ADDRESS_723586] of the Medical Monitor.  
 
6.0 Reporting : All SAE, UAP, and PD are reported to the IRB within defined 
timelines.  
 
 VA Central IRB Protocol Template – version 10/26/2012  Page 36 of 48 
 6.1 Adverse event reporting  
Adverse event (AE) information will be monitored in detail throughout the course of the 
study.  AEs are  defined as and will be graded as to their expectedness and attribution 
(unrelated,  possibly, probably, or definitely related to the protocol). [CONTACT_550851] 
will act as the medical monitor to determine relationship of AEs to the study intervention 
if uncertain. AEs will be reviewed by [CONTACT_550836], graded, and reported to 
the DCC . The DCC will code  the events using MedDRA  and will assist the CCC with 
IRB reporting  per reporting guidelines.   
6.[ADDRESS_723587] of LA. Therefore  
only GI distress related and probably related to study of any intensity is  tracked and 
reported.  All other AEs are collected and stored at the study sites.  
 
6.3 Limited reporting of AE  
Not all AE captured at sites are reported to the DCC. The limited set of A E reported to 
the DCC via the REDCap database is according to guidelines in 6.3a below . Serious AE 
(SAE)  and select UP and PD  are reported under expedited guidelines according to IRB 
and other monitoring entity requirements.

 6.4 Adverse event (AE) definition : Any untoward or undesirable, a lthough not  
           necessarily unexpected, event experienced by a human subject that may be a  
           result of:  
• The interventions and interactions used in the research.  
• The collection of identifiable private information in the research.  
• An underlying disease, disorder, or condition of the subject.  
• Other circumstances unrelated to the re search or any underlying disease, 
disorder, or condition of the subject.  
6.5 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) definition : Any AE that:  
• Is fatal.  
• Is life -threatening.  
• Is persistent or significantly disabling or incapacitating.  
• Results in inpatient hospit alization or prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
• Results in psychological or emotional harm requiring treatment.  
• Creates a persistent or significant disability.  
• Causes a congenital anomaly or birth defect.  
• Results in a significant medical incident (co nsidered to be a serious study  
  related event  because, based upon appropriate medical judgment, it may  
  jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to     
  prevent  one of the outcomes listed in this definition).  
6.6 Unantic ipated problem (UP)  definition : 
• Any event that is not expected given within the context of the study.  
• Any event that places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm or 
discomfort relative  to what was previously known.  
• No harm to a subject needs t o occur for an event to be an unanticipated   
problem.  
 
6.7 Protocol Deviation (PD) : The term “protocol deviation” is not defined by 
[CONTACT_550837] (45 CFR 46) or the FDA human 
subjects regulations (21 CFR 50). All PD are graded b y the treating neurologist 
and entered into REDCap. Severe PD have expedited reporting to the DCC via 
REDCap.  Moderate PD are entered into REDCap according to the usual 
timelines. Mild PD are recorded on the site AE log only.  
 
6.7a.  Mild PD:  
• The deviation  resulted in no harm or risk of harm to research participants; or  
• The deviation did not result in or require any substantive action to be taken or 
result in a substantive change to the subject ’s condition or status (i.e., did not 
 VA Central IRB Protocol Template – version 10/26/[ADDRESS_723588]’s parti cipation in a substantive way, did not result in a change 
to the subject’s emotional or clinical condition, did not cause an adverse 
experience or require a change to the clinical care of the subject, etc.)  
• The deviation had no substantive effect on the v alue of the data collected (i.e., 
the deviation does not confound the scientific analysis of the results);  
• The deviation did not result from willful or knowing misconduct on the part of the 
investigator(s);  
• The deviation is easily corrected (e.g., consen ting a subject with an old version of 
an ICF, recording data on an expi[INVESTIGATOR_5697]/incorrect form, forgetting to record data that 
may be acceptably recorded at the next visit, etc.)  
 
6.7b.  Moderate  PD: 
• The deviation resulted in a harm or risk of harm that is not significant; or  
• The deviation resulted in the need for minimal risk interventions, such as those 
defined in 45CFR46.110 and 21CFR56.110;  
• The deviation resulted in the loss or improper collection or recording of some 
data for one or more subjects, but did  not invalidate the entire data set for the 
study;  
• The deviation resulted in a regulatory violation that can be acceptably resolved;   
• Repeated minor protocol deviations from the same laboratory, site or research 
team; or  
• There has been a failure to foll ow action ordered to correct minor or moderate 
protocol deviations . 
 
6.7c.  Severe  PD: 
• The deviation resulted in or required a substantive action to be taken or resulted 
in a change to the subject’s condition or status;  
• The deviation has significantly harm ed or posed a risk of significant harm to 
research participants;  
• The deviation has substantially damaged the scientific integrity of the data 
collected for the entire study;  
• The deviation is evidence of willful or knowing misconduct on the part of the 
investigator(s);  
• The deviation involves serious or continuing noncompliance with federal, state, or 
local research regulations;  
• There have been repeated minor and/or moderate protocol deviations from the 
same laboratory, site or research team;  
• There has be en a failure to follow action ordered to correct minor and/or 
moderate protocol deviations;   
 VA Central IRB Protocol Template – version 10/26/2012  Page 39 of 48 
 • There has been a failure to follow action ordered in accordance with the 
emergency action provision of this policy.  
6.8 Data a nd Safety Monitoring Plan   
Data and  safety monitoring will involve AE reporting by [CONTACT_96577], and review of 
AE, SAE, UP, protocol deviations ( PD), dropouts, complaints , or breaches of 
confidentiality  by [CONTACT_15791] . Subjects will be encouraged to report any study -related 
and/or health pr oblems at any time to the study site staff. AEs reported to the DCC and 
other data and safety issues  found during site visit audit s will be subject to additional 
reporting (IRB, FDA) per reporting  policies.  
 
A Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be a ssembled for subject safety. This 
board will consist of members who have expertise in any of the following: neurology, 
multiple sclerosis , clinical trials, and medical safety. The board members will document 
their lack of conflict of interest and approve a  DSMB Charter prior to study start. All 
members of the DSMB will review and approve study protocol and informed consent 
forms for all study sites prior to enrollment.  
 
The DSMB Chair or DSMB member designee reviews SAE in real time according to 
reporting t imetables (6.0). The DSMB receive s quarterly reports, developed by t he DCC 
and SCC , which include s aggregate reports of AE, SAE, UP, and PD, including the 
safety lab data according to Limited Reporting of AE (6.3) presented grouped by [CONTACT_550838] s ite (as necessary).  The board will meet  every six months , as necessary, 
to review quarterly reports, enrollment/screening progress, data collection problems, 
and missing data. No non -safety related study outcome analyses will be performed until 
study compl etion, unless the committee determines there is a compelling reason to do 
so related to patient safety concerns. The DSMB also meet s when the last subject 
completes participation. The DSMB will provide a written summary of each meeting to 
the PI [CONTACT_4490] a sta tement about appropriateness of continuation of the study.  DSMB 
report s are communicated at least annually to the Central IRB and non -VA IRBs.   
 
7.0 Privacy and Confidentiality  
7.1. Protected h ealth  information  (PHI)  
Study subjects  will be given a unique study ID t hat will be linked to the name [CONTACT_13255] [CONTACT_270853] a key . The key will be  held by [CONTACT_550839] , and 
for all subj ects by [CONTACT_978]. Local sites may collect PHI elements including name, address, 
email address, telephone numbers, dates  of birth, social security numbers, and medical 
record numbers for the purpose of recruitment, screening potential subjects, scheduling, 
 VA Central IRB Protocol Template – version 10/26/[ADDRESS_723589] study procedures such 
as laboratory assessments and MRIs a re performed  at the local sites.  Dates of study 
visit will be  the only PHI element recorded in the REDCap study  database, the only PHI 
viewed by [CONTACT_361668], and the only PHI retained in the data repository (BND #2916). PHI 
will be  transmitted on MRIs to the Central MRI Reading Site in order to properly identify 
the scans. The PHI elements may include date s of study visit s, name s, date s of birth, 
social security number s, and medical record number s. Prior to analyses and to ensure 
blinding, s taff at the Central MRI Reading Site will ensure that only the subject ID along 
with the PHI element of date of study visit are visible to the MRI analysts.  This is 
outlined on the ICF. All other PHI including names, addresses, contact [CONTACT_550840].  
7.[ADDRESS_723590] copi[INVESTIGATOR_550782] -site locked cabinets, and electronic 
data stored on secure servers according to the privacy regulations of  each study site.  
Trained and designated study staff will enter s tudy data , from each site  and the Central 
MRI Reading Site , into a web-based REDCap database . OCTRI's REDCap software is  a 
highly secure and robust web -based research d ata c ollection and management system, 
which is physically housed on servers located in the OHSU’s Advanced Computing 
Center.  The servers are housed behind both the OHSU fire wall and a second ACC 
firewall.  All web -based data transmissions are encrypted with  industry -standard SSL 
methods.    
REDCap is a robust multi -level security system that will enable the PM and study PI [INVESTIGATOR_550783] "minimum necessary" data access for their research staff, including 
specification of data fields that are identifiers.  The only PHI entered into REDCap will be 
the dates of study visits. Study sites will maintain up -to-date study staff personnel lists so 
that REDCap access is limited to approved study staff. User activities are logged to 
enable auditing of all data access . REDCap is jointly managed in accordance with 
OHSU Information Security Directives by [CONTACT_311460]'s 
 VA Central IRB Protocol Template – version 10/26/[ADDRESS_723591] copi[INVESTIGATOR_550784], when necessary,  through secure 
methods. For VA to VA transmission, this can include email using PKI or RMS encryption. 
Otherwise, transmission is via secure fax or secure mail such as FedEx/UPS with tracking. 
MRI images will be sent to the Centr al MRI Reading Site by [CONTACT_550841], or on compact disks  
by [CONTACT_550842]/UPS with tracking.  
Study data manage ment is under the oversight of the  DCC . Members o f the DCC will have 
REDCap access to view, enter and edit data, and update the REDCap database 
throughout the study for the purposes of quality control. The DCC will work with the PM 
and site study staff to resolve data discrepancies in an ongoing fashion throughout the 
study.  
Blood samples for subjects participating in the optional BND are shipped to the VA 
Portland Health Care System via s ecure mail, such as FedEx/UPS with tracking . The only 
PHI on the specimen label is the date of  specimen collection . An electronic copy of 
coded data that does not contain protected health information, except for the date of 
specimen collection, will be transferred to the BND for storage via methods allowed by 
[CONTACT_550843] , such as an sftp account, o r on compact disks by [CONTACT_550844]. 
The BND  is located at the VA Portland Health Care System in Portland, Oregon, in VA 
Building 101, Room [ADDRESS_723592]. Rebecca 
Spain, director of the biorepository, makes the decisions regarding how the blood 
samples and data are used in the future under IRB -approved protocols . Samples from 
the biorepository released to other investigators may  include  the date of specimen 
collection . 
The ICF and HIPAA authorization provide  information about how specimens will be 
transferred, how long they will be kept, and who will view/use the specimens. Subjects 
who consented to the LAPMS study prior to the addition of the option of donating blood 
to the  biorepository will re -consent with the version that includes the blood donation to 
the BND  either at the next study visit, or if necessary, via an approved phone script.  
The ICF will describe that the HIPAA identifier , date of study visit, will be included o n all 
stored study data includ ing in the REDCap database on MRI images sent to the Central 
MRI Reading Site , and  on specimens within the BND. . The ICF also describes that 
 VA Central IRB Protocol Template – version 10/26/[ADDRESS_723593] Opera ting 
Procedures , a Manual of Operations & Procedures,  and data collection forms  to each 
site. An Investigator Meeting will familiarize the LSIs with the study prior to study start. 
As necessary, t he study monitor (PM)  will hold [ADDRESS_723594]  
regular (e.g.  monthly ) teleconferences with site study staff  for data collection and related  
issues. LSIs are expected to hold regular meetings with their site research staff  in order 
to review study progress, review adverse events, and other st udy matters . Email will 
also be utilized as a primary method of communicating information about changes to the 
protocol, informed consent, and HIPAA authorization. Communication about AEs, 
SAEs, unanticipated problems, or DSMB reports will also be conducte d by [CONTACT_6968], 
phone, or the LSI teleconferences as appropriate to the level of urgency of information 
 VA Central IRB Protocol Template – version 10/26/2012  Page 43 of 48 
 transmitted.  This information will be relayed  to the appropriate IRBs  under the direction 
of the DCC  according to the DSMP (sec. 6. 8). 
Initial and ongoing I RB approval documents will be provided by [CONTACT_550845]  
[INVESTIGATOR_550785].  Acknowledgment of these 
notifications will be maintained as documentation of understanding from each study site.  
Study sites will be notified when enrolment targets are reached, when sites have 
completed their final study visits, and when the entire study has completed. 
Acknowledgment of these notifications will be maintained as documentation of 
understanding from each study sit e. Study LSIs will have the opportunity to participate 
in manuscript preparation with authorship order related to recruitment achieved and/or 
level of participation in manuscript editing.

safety, protocol compliance, and regulatory compliance. The monitoring may include the 
following: Audit data listings to source documen tation, ensure subject eligibility, verify 
reporting of adverse events, assess compliance with protocol, audit regulatory files, and 
ensure adequate site personnel training. The Central Research Pharmacy may request 
site pharmacy investigational drug accou ntability review during these visits. Centralized 
monitoring processes at the DCC occur at regular intervals and will include data quality 
checks, site performance checks, and safety reporting monitoring. Regular feedback 
and data queries will be issued to  each site by [CONTACT_15791], and resolution of queries 
managed by [CONTACT_550846].

Varied clinical performance: MRI is an objective and quantitative outcome 
measures but can vary due  to acquisition techniques. Standardization of 
acquisition will include using the same MRI scanner at each site and uniform 
positioning for all participants. Participants will be permitted oral muscle relaxants 
or anxiolytics only during the MRI. Quality c ontrol processes (sec. D5) set in place

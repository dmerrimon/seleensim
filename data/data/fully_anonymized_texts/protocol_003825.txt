Overview: The study will: 1) Obtain input  on feasibility, usability, and acceptability of using mHealth in 
behavior change by [CONTACT_78389] a device for rural older adults; 2) Develop, refine  and tailor  MOWI  in research 
settings; 3) Conduct  MOWI in subjects’ homes. The overall goal is to improve older  adult  physical function in 
rural areas and use the results as a basis for an R01 randomized trial testing the MOWI’s delivery in the home.  
 
Study Setting /Population: Dartmouth -Hitchcock (D -H) serves 1.5 million persons from a circumscribed area 
of rur al New Hampshire/Vermont. The site of Lebanon, NH, is a typi[INVESTIGATOR_78379] (16.2% aged 
≥65 years; 95.4% Caucasian83). Of 13,293 p rimary care patients ≥65years old at D -H, 3,987 are study eligible 
(~30% obese84). The Center  for Health & Aging (CHA)  has rooms for  study assessments. In-home evaluations 
will use CHA video equipment .  
 
Recruitment: As a Geriatrician working with an interdisciplinary team, I 
have ready access to potential subjects from a practice panel of ~[ADDRESS_85562] review and e- mailed/mailed letters 
describing the study (after HIPAA waiver). Posters/ handouts will be placed 
strategically at D- H. Colleagues  will give information materials to patients  
requesting permission for contact [CONTACT_78390] r esearch assistant . With 
respect to the qualitative component, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_78380] 6 clinicians (from 87 in the provider network) to participate in interviews. [CONTACT_78409] will use the 
CHA’s extensive aging services network to recruit 4 leaders of aging 
services organizations for study participation.  
 
Selection Criteria: Focus groups, interviews, and usability testing will target English -speaking obese older 
adults (age≥65years and BMI ≥30kg/m217 or waist circumference ≥88/102cm85 in females/males).  Excluded 
from eligibility are adults with severe mental or life -threatening illness, dementia, substance use, history of 
bariatric surgery, suicidal ideation, unable to provide consent/perform measures, or residing in a nursing home. Aim 1a provider interv iews will target English -speaking, licensed, outpatient, primary care clinicians and 
community aging service program directors. Older adult participants in Aims 2 & [ADDRESS_85563] less  than a 5% weight loss in the past 6 months, and 
be without advanced co- morbidity, exercise restrictions88 or involvement in other research studies. 
 
Screening/Consent : Subjects expressing  interest will be mailed/emailed forms, evaluated by [CONTACT_78391] , and t hose meeting criteria invited to an RA -led session to verify final eligibility, review and 
complete consent forms, and answer queries. Competence for consent will be assured by: [CONTACT_78392] (all Aims) and a Callahan score ≥4 (Aims 2 & 3). Written consent will be obtained before enrollment. 
The RA will obtain screening/baseline measures, and provide a list of contact [CONTACT_8972] (see Human Subjects).    
 
Aim 1b (Adapt Amulet) : Adapt a novel mHealth device (Amulet) to assess geriatric functional measures 
in a sample of older, obese adults: Amulet  will be modified to measure functional outcomes ( activity type , 
strength, gait speed) in older adults supporting MOWI’s exercise component  using self -monitoring and 
feedback. This device (Figure 3)  provid es an adaptable platform for remote sensing and health behavior 
change . I chose Amulet  due to  its potential for team science and as a ecologic momentary assessment  
system96. It measures more about human activity  unlike devices82,[ADDRESS_85564]-worn device does not rely on other devices  (ie: smartphone)  to function. 
Battery life will likely  exceed 7 days. The Amulet display provides personalized programmable reminders 
(blinking lights, textual display, or vibration)  and audio- visual feedback  to allow goal attainment . A 9-axis 
gyroscope, accelerometer, and magnetometer integrates sensor s capturing motion, speed, isometric exercise 
data and activity type (sedentary, walking, running). Low -energy Bluetooth 4.[ADDRESS_85565]. Kotz’ s Amulet team will develop and configure applications assessing: steps/distance; strength;  
activity  type; activity feedback . Objective measures will be validated with Amulet. Amulet will sample data and 
detect steppi[INVESTIGATOR_78381]101,102 and step counts103. Distance  is 
calculated as steps × distance/step. Upper limb strength will be assessed using sensors placed on a Thera -FIGURE 2:  STUDY OVERVIEW  
 

band104 handle connected to a strain gauge placed in series reading the combined force experienced using an 
analog -to-digital converter105, communicating back to Amulet.  
Usability evaluations during technology deployment will ensure a user -centered design, using 
videotaped sessions to enable careful review by [CONTACT_78393]. Open- ended semi -structured 
interviews to  the first [ADDRESS_85566] -initiated tasks involved in Amulet’s operation. 
Continuous commentary (Think Aloud usability method109,110; see Appendix) with non- verbal/verbal reactions 
will be used to evaluate Amulet’s ease of use, complexity, and design flaws. Subjects wi ll rate their 
confidence in using the system (see Appendix). A semi- structured approach will be employed including 
questions such as: What are helpful formats for feedback messages?; What types of Amulet data will be most 
useful?; How can mHealth be of maximum utility to users?; What are the highest priorities for feedback? 
Adaptive testing will be performed as it is difficult to fully develop messages prior to pi[INVESTIGATOR_48124].  
Aim 1 informing future work : Focus groups, interviews and usability testing will be used to create the 
intervention manual, adapt the Amulet, and optimize Aim 2 (and to the Amulet/Telehealth teams, allowing refinement prior to integration into future cohorts and tailoring content to meet older adult needs. Formative 
mixed methods will be used to identify and address design and content flaws and unanticipated challenges as 
part of a critical feedback loops using st aged, iterative, usability testing.  
 
Recruitment and Retention Strategies  
Participants  will be recruited from referrals  from Family  Medicine/General Internal  Medicine providers  
(Primary  Care),  providers  from the Dartmouth  Weight  & Wellness  Center,  and community  members  attending 
the Dartmouth  Center  for Health  and Aging  (DCHA).  I will inform  clinicians  of Family  Medicine and General  
Internal  Medicine and the staff at the Weight  & Wellness  Center  of the proposed study  during section 
meetings.  [CONTACT_78409]  has an extensive network  of community -care providers  and will send e- mails/le tters to 
the CHA’s  listserv  and mailing  list requesting  participation.  Posters  will be placed in each examination room,  in 
the patient  waiting  areas  and in common  areas  of the DCHA.  All posters  will have been pre-approved by 
[CONTACT_78394]/family  advisors  and the Committee  for the Protection for Human  Subjects.  Additionally,  postings  
in the DCHA  quarterly  newsletter,  the DHMC weekly  D-H Today  online bulletin,  the weekly  Geisel  School  of 
Medicine  at Dartmouth newsletter,  and electronic  mailing  lists will promo te the study.  We anticipate advertising  
in the local newspaper  as well. A dedicated phone number  and e-mail will be assigned to this study.    
Patients  will be i dentified  from the PI’s clinical practice group at D-H, word  of mouth,  or other  means  as 
indicated below.  We will also identify  prospective individuals  fulfilling  basic  eligibility  criteria  after obtaining  a 
HIPAA waiver  for electronic  record  review  from the Committee  for the Protection of Human  Subjects.  A pre-
assessment eligibility  would  be performed to limit the burden on patients  should they be ineligible  after full 
informed  consent  for the requisite  aims.  This will allow  the investigators  to query  our electronic  medical  record  
and if necessary  send  targeted  messages  and/or  letters  to individuals  that may possibly  qualify  for this study.  If 
needed,  the study  staff will send a letter  to prospective individuals  requesting their involvement  either  by [CONTACT_78395]  (through the electronic  medical  record).  This letter  will describe the study  and provide contact  
[CONTACT_78396].  The CTO  will also have details  of the study.  Any individuals  that have  
expressed interest  will be contact[CONTACT_78397].  A pre-screeni ng questionnaire or electronic  link to RedCAP  (See  below)  or by 
[CONTACT_78398]/emailed to participants  (depending  on patient  preference).   
As part of Aim 1a, eligible  patients  will be asked  to participate in qualitative  focus  groups  and individual  semi-
structured  interviews  with a member  of the team.  It is anticipated  that the focus  group  will occur  4-[ADDRESS_85567]  for clinicians  and community  leaders  of health  and senior  centers.  At the time of 
communication,  the consent  form will be sent to these  individuals  for review  (paper  or electronic)  and if they 
agree to the terms  of the consent,  the individuals  will attend these  sessions  at a mutually  convenient  time for 
the study  participants  and the Research  Team.  A reminder  letter  will be sent either  via myDH  (through  the 
electronic  medical  record)  by [CONTACT_978], and/or  a hard copy  letter  to the patient’s  address.    
As part of Aim 1b, eligible  patients  will be asked  to attend the DCHA  to confirm  eligibility  and informed consent  
process  by [CONTACT_21118]/PI  (See  Section on Informed  Consent  Procedures  for Full details).  Those  ineligible  will be 
informed  by [CONTACT_78399].  We anticipate  that eligibility  to study  onset  will be 
roughly  4-6 weeks  after screening.   
As part of Aim 2 and 3 (including  the pre-pi[INVESTIGATOR_78382] 2), eligible  patients  will be asked  either  to attend  a baseline 
visit with the RA or PI [INVESTIGATOR_78383]/PI  (See  Section on Informed  Consent  Procedures  for Full Details ). Those  ineligible  will be 
informed  by [CONTACT_78399].  We anticipa te that eligibility  to study  onset  will be 
roughly  4-6 weeks  after screening.  The patient’s  primary  care provider  will provide medical  clearance prior to 
study  enrollment  and sign a paper  or electronic  form allowing  the individual  to undergo this intervention.  They  
will be kept informed of any abnormal  symptoms  or problems  throughout  the study.   
The investigators  recognize  that this intervention may lead to attrition.  To reduce the risk of participant  
drop- out, participants  will be reminded of sessions  with a phone call, e- mail,  and Amulet  messaging  reminder  
from the RA. Individuals  will be compensated  with sandwiches/snacks  plus $[ADDRESS_85568] for the focus  groups  of 
the qualitative  aim (Aim 1a), $[ADDRESS_85569]  semi -structured  interviews,  a nominal  $10/hour  
payment  for the prevalidation phase of Aim 1b (cash,  gift-card),  a $[ADDRESS_85570] each for Aim 1b, $100 for 
completing  >80%  of the visits  and assessments  for the three -month  program  (Aim 2) - $25 per assessment,  
and $200 for completing >80%  of the visits  and assessments  at 6-months  (Aim 3). Payment  will be made at 
study  conclusion according to institutional  policies.  They  will also receive a fixed  schedule of items  (pens,  
notepads,  thank  you cards)  to recognize their participation to date.  Participants  will have the option of declining  
such incentives  at any time.  We will provide a $[ADDRESS_85571] or equivalent  for each visit (Aim 4).  
 No involvement  of special  vulnerable population such as fetuses,  neonates,  pregnant  woman,  children,  
prisoners,  institutionalized individuals  or others  who may be considered  vulnerable will be included in this 
study.  The study  will be a single -arm study  and there will be no assignment  to a study  group for this study.   
 
Retention  
We recognize that a ttrition  rates  in obesity  studies  range between 25-50%.  For Aim 1a (qualitative  
studies),  we will target  4 focus  groups  of 6-8 individuals  (24-32 individuals  total),  6-[ADDRESS_85572]  for Aim 1, two waves  for Aim 2, and in 4 waves  for 
Aim 3 to reach target  enrollment  and completion.  Should we exceed target  enrollment  and completion,  we will 
continue gathering  measurements  on all individuals.  With the new arm (MOWI -P), we anticipate recruiting  an 
additional 16 subjects.  For Aim 4 (Weight  Maintenance),  we anticipate  recruiting 60% of each  of the original  
sample for Aim 2 (ie: 4 waves  @ 8 = 32 x 0.6 = approximately  19 subjects).   
 
STATISTICAL DESIGN AND POWER  
Aim 1 (Qualitative assessment ) will use mixed -methods to adapt Amulet and MOWI for use in rural 
older obese adults.  
Aim 1b ( Adapt Amulet) : Adapt Amulet to assess functional measures:  Agreement/reliability for 
upper/lower strength (Thera- bands and STS), gait speed, and steps will be calculated. Descriptive statistics will 
outline distributions, mean differences/ ratios assessing Amulet’s measures to corresponding steps, speed or 
streng th, and for usability testing. Relative/absolute test- retest reliability of mean differences between 
test/retest using 95% confidence intervals and standard error of mean to examine bias and intra-class coefficients will be reported. Paired t -test will tes t for bias. Scatterplots and Bland- Altman plots for 
miscalibration will be viewed, and a relation of variance to mean (data heteroscedasticity) to assess agreement between measures.  
Data and Safety Monitoring Plan 
Per the instructions  for the “Human  Subjects”  section of PHS-398/SF424 (R+R)  the proposed study  
intervention could have harmful  effects  but does  NOT  meet  the criteria  for an NIH-defined  Phase  III trial.  
To ensure  participant  safety, data integrity  and validity,  the Research Assistant  will meet  with the 
Principal  Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_78384],  and will be responsible for reviewing  the following:  number  of subjects  
completing  the protocol;  subject  withdrawal  and sources  of data loss; any serious  or minor  adverse  
consequences  and actions  taken to remedy  the issue;  new,  timely  information that could impact  efficacy  and/or  
safety  of the program  or procedures.  The meeting reports  will be forwarded to the Committee  for the Protecti on 
of Human  Subjects  at the time of annual  review  and serious  events  will be reported  per institutional  
regulations.  
The current  intervention is not an experimental  agent  and its proposed  risk to individuals  is likely  
considered low. We anticipate that there  will be a low risk of adverse  medical  events  associated  with this 
intervention.  A physician will be available on the premises  during  all intervention sessions  and monitor  patient  
progress  and/or  adverse  events  during  each  session and be responsible for monitoring the data and safety  for 
this proposal.  However,  we intend on establishing an independent  data safety  monitoring  process  that will 
include an independent  data safety  monitoring board (DSMB).  The committee  will consist of experienced 
researchers  in the Department  of Medicine and The Dartmouth Institute  at the Geisel  School  of Medicine  at 
Dartmouth.  Such  members  will consist of researchers  who are not involved  in the development  or execution of 
this proposal.  Per institutional  policies,  no investigators  will have any conflict  of interests  with or financial  
stakes  in the research  outcome.  This independent  board will follow  the policy  for data and safety  monitoring 
published by [CONTACT_78400]:  adverse consequences  (whether  
serious  or minor)  to any subject  and actions  taken  to remedy  the problem;  data quality,  completeness,  
timeliness;  performance of the study  site; reviewing the ent ire IRB-approved study  protocol,  manual  of 
procedures  with regard  to safety , recruitment,  intervention,  data management,  quality  control,  analysis  and 
informed  consent  documents  with regard  to applicability  and readability;  recruitment  and retention;  adherence 
to protocol;  maintenance  of confidentiality;  external  factors  impactin g safety  or ethics  of the study;  and new or 
evolving  information  regarding the expected efficacy  and/or  safety  of the MOWI  intervention.  Additionally,  the 
DSMB  will review  the study  in relation to intervention effects, gender  and minority  exclusion;  propos e 
appropriate  analyses  and periodically  review  developi[INVESTIGATOR_78385];  consider  the rationale 
semi -annually  for continuing  the study;  review  and make recommendations  on proposed protocol  changes  
during the trial. All recommended changes  to the protocol  will be adhered to by [CONTACT_978]. The board will identify  
relevant  data parameters  and the format  of how the information  will be regularly  reported.  Written  reports  of 
each meeting  will be sent to the program  officer  and additional reports  as needed,  in addition to providing  
timely  advice on issues  regarding data discrepancies.  They  will review  manuscripts  of trial results.  In addition,  
they will recommend  subject  recruitment  be initiated  after receipt  of a satisfactory  protocol  and/or  postpone 
recommendations  for initiation  of subj ect recruitment  until after the receipt  of satisfactory revised protocols.  
Summary  reports  of the meetings  will be sent to the CPHS  at the time of annual  reviews.  The monitoring 
committee  will ensure safe and effective  conduct  of the intervention and recommend  conclusion of the 
intervention when significant  benefits  or risks have developed or the intervention is unlikely  to be concluded 
successfully. All monitoring will be timely  and effective. Data  from the Research Assi stant  and Biostatistician  
will be forwarded to the DSMB  for review  (and to the Program  Officer  upon request).  The DSMB  will conduct  
reviews  of the study  every  [ADDRESS_85573]’s  healthcare providers  with appropriate  
information,  as needed,  concerning  the individu al.  
 
Adverse Event Reporting  
Serious,  unexpected  adverse events  (SAE)  related to study  participation are anticipated to be rare. 
Study  personnel  will be trained to report  all adverse events.  In addition,  screening for adverse  events  
potentially  related to the study  intervention will occur  during the routine administration  of study  assessment  
measures.  These interview -based indicators  will augment  required  SAE reports  by [CONTACT_24355],  including  
specific  items  in the assessment interviews  evaluating epi[INVESTIGATOR_78386]-related injuries, unexpected 
medical  events,  medical  emergency  room  admissions,  medical  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602],  or unplanned medical  clinic  
visits.  If an SAE occurs, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_78387],  to the DSMB,  and to the NIA Program  Officer  within  10 days  of the study’s  knowledge of the SAE (if 
unanticipated)  unless  otherwise  requested by [CONTACT_4318].  The PI, in consultation with co-investigators  and 
others,  as needed,  will review  the adverse event  report  and gather  other  information as needed  to investigate  
the event  and determine the need  for subsequent  action.  Any subsequent  action will be documented and 
reported to the CPHS. In addition,  any SAE will also be reported to the NIH program  officer  and they will be 
informed  of any actions  taken  by [CONTACT_78401] a result  of its continuing  review.   The CPHS  will review  each 
reported adverse event  to determine whether:  the participants  in the study  should receive additional 
information  related to continuing  their participation;  the protocol,  study  plan or consent  form should  be 
modified;  or the study  should be temporarily  suspended.  If the CPHS  determines  that some  action  in response  
to the adverse  event  is necessary,  the CPHS  will promptly  inform  the PI. All deaths  will be reported  in an 
expedited manner,  normally  within  24 hours of t he study’s  knowledge.  The report  of death  will also be 
submitted to the NIA Program  Administrator  and to the CPHS  and to the DSMB  Chair.

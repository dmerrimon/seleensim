patients rec eiving lumpectomy and whole breast irradiation.13   The EORTC [ZIP_CODE]/[ZIP_CODE]

Phase I, II and III studies conducted at the National Institute of Oncology in 
Hungary have some of the longest follow -up data to date. Forty- five patients with T1 
breast cancer were enrolled in the Phase I -II study and underwent lumpectomy followed by 
[CONTACT_349091] 7 x 4.33 Gy or 7 x 5.2 Gy to the tumor bed. With a median follow -up 
of 57 months, the local recurrence rate was 4.4%. The 5 -year probability of cancer -
specific, relapse- free and local recurrence -free survival was 90.0%, 85.9%, and 95.6%, 
respectively. The phase III study was subsequently performed with an additional [ADDRESS_433725] brachytherapy 7 x 5.2 Gy to the 
tumor bed alone. With a median follow -up of 30 months, this study also confirms excellent 
locoregional tumor control of 100% in both arms. The 3- year probability of cancer -specific 
and relapse- free sur vival was essentially equivalent, 98.1% and 98.4% in the WBRT group

Rationale for Partial Breast Irradiation with Protons  
 
                                                                                                                                          OSR# [ADDRESS_433729] irradiation.  Proton therapy would eliminate the additional surgical procedure 
required for brachytherapy. In addition, it is likely to improve dose homogeneity within the 
target volume, which may improve cosmetic results and reduce the risk of symptomatic fat 
necrosis associated with brachytherapy which has been reported to be as high a s 40%. In 
comparison to three -dimensional conformal radiation therapy, the inherently superior depth 
dose characteristics (Bragg peak) would minimize the integral dose delivered to 
surrounding normal tissues, particularly the lung and heart. We anticipate that this will 
result in decreased toxicity and less risk of radiation induced malignancy.

breast, shows minimal or no changes in shape or size.  There 
may be minimal subcutaneous fibrosis or scarring.

be used to document cosmetic outcome.  Photos will include a 
“close up” view of the treated breast with the subjects arms 
raised over the head and a photo of both breasts with the subjects 
hands on hips.  Photographs will not include the subjects’ face.  
 
9.0 Statistics and Data Management  
 
9.1 Initially 25 subjects will be enrolled into this trial.  After a  
toxicit y evaluation is completed and felt to be acceptable, 25 
additional subjects will be enrolled for a total of 50 subjects.  
 
An additional 50 subjects will be enrolled under the new 
eligibility criteria defined in the April 4, 2008 revision.  
  
 
 
9.2 All acute to xicities will be scored according to the NCI Common 
Toxicity Criteria v2.0.  Late toxicity will be scored per RTOG 
guidelines.  Any toxicities with a threshold of Grade 3 or above 
will be reported as an adverse event.  Frequencies of toxicities 
will be tab ulated and compared to published reports.  
 
9.3 Frequency and type of recurrence (local, regional, distant) will  
be tabulated and compared to prior studies.  
 
9.4 Data Management and Publications  
 
Treatment records and study data will be collected, stored and 
maint ained in the department of radiation medicine.  Data 
 
                                                                                                                                          OSR# [ZIP_CODE]  12 analysis and publications will be performed under the direction 
of the study principal investigators.  All presentations, posters, 
abstracts and manuscripts that include data from this study will 
be revi ewed and approved by [CONTACT_9154]’s prior to presentation 
or submission.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 2 of 76 Template 18.0PROTOCOL AMENDMENT SUMMARY OF CHANGES TABLE
Amendment 1 (01Feb2021)
Overall Rationale for the Amendment
The principal reason for this amendment was to introduce a complementary safety cohort 
(which will be referred to as the safety cohort throughout the protocol) and clarify the number of subjects to be enrolled and the analysis populations for the efficacy and safety analyses. The safety cohort will serve the purpose of providing additional safety assessment. Although efficacy data will be collected for the safety cohort, only descriptive summaries will be provided and th ere is no intent to pool the efficacy data from the safety cohort with that from 
the primary cohort. These changes were made to reflect mitigation of the low RSV circulation 
and impact on efficacy data due to the COVID-19 pandemic related measures.

STUDY DESIGN
Study D5290C00004 (MELODY) is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_9205] [ADDRESS_600998] RSV season. The population to be enrolled is healthy late preterm and term infants born ≥ 35 weeks 0 days GA who would not receive RSV prophylaxis based on the American Academy of 
Pediatrics (AAP) or other local or national guid elines. A total of approximately  3,000 infa nts will be 
randomized 2:1 to receive a 50-mg (if weight < 5 kg) or 100-mg (if weight ≥5 kg) IM dose of MEDI8897 
(N = 2,000) or placebo (N = 1,000). Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_150991] (northern hemisphere 
[NH], southern hemisphere [SH]) and by [CONTACT_469030] ( ≤ 3 months, > 3 to 
≤6 months, > 6 months). Enrollment of infants > 6 mont hs of age will be limited to approximately 500. The 
study will comprise 2 cohorts: a primary cohort (N = ~1,500) and a complementary sa fety cohort (hereafter 
referred to as the safety cohort; N = ~1,500) for a total of approximately 3,000 s ubjects. The pr imary cohort 
will include subjects from the NH2019, SH2020, and NH2020 enrollment seasons. The safety cohort will include subjects enrolled after the NH2020 enrollment s eason. Given the largely reduced circulation of RSV 
due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic related measures, the efficacy analyses performed in the primary analysis for the primary cohort will serve the purpose of evaluating the efficacy of MEDI8897 in the study population. Although efficacy data will also be collected for the safety cohort, only descriptive

Subjects will be monitored throughout the study for LRTI. All subjects seeking medical attention for a 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_4375] (in either the inpatient or outpatient setting) will be evaluated for the occurrence of LRTI. All subjects found to have an LRTI and all subjects who require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416], 
even if there is not a diagnosis of LRTI, should have respi[INVESTIGATOR_468957]. Samples should be collected for all of these events (even those not meeting the protocol definition of LRTI). Subjects who have a primary hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416] (ie, upper or lower tract) or a respi[INVESTIGATOR_316667] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or who seek outpatient medical attention (including ER visits) for a lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_4375], will be assessed clinically for the presence of LRTI and for RSV by [CONTACT_469031][INVESTIGATOR_171919]. 
In addition to the clinical assessment of LRTI, there is a protocol definition using objective criteria for the 
determination of a medically attended protocol-defined LRTI. To meet the protocol-defined endpoint of medically attended LRTI, subjects with signs of LRTI must have documented at least one physical exam finding of rhonchi, rales, crackles, or wheeze AND at least one of the following clinical signs:
• Increased respi[INVESTIGATOR_316670] (age < 2 months, ≥ 60 breaths/min; age 2 to 6 months, ≥50 breaths/min; 
age > 6 months, ≥ 40 breaths/min) OR
• Hypoxemia (in room air: oxygen saturation < 95% at altitudes ≤ 1,800 meters or < 92% at altitudes 
> 1,800 meters), OR
• Clinical signs of severe respi[INVESTIGATOR_3765] (eg, acute hypoxic or ventilatory failure, new onset apnea, 
nasal flaring, intercostal, subcostal or supraclavicular retractions, grunting) or dehydration secondary to 
inadequate oral intake due to respi[INVESTIGATOR_1506] (need for intravenous fluid)
Testing for RSV will be performed centrally using the [LOCATION_002] Food and Drug Administration-cleared
and Conformité Européenne or European Conformity-marked in vitro diagnostic real-time RT-PCR assay 
(Lyra RSV + human metapneumovirus [hMPV] assay; Quidel Corporation, San Diego, CA). A diagnosis of RSV LRTI requires having a respi[INVESTIGATOR_468958]-PCR.
TARGET SUBJECT POPULATION
Healthy late preterm and term infants > [ADDRESS_601000] RSV season
TREATMENT GROUPS AND REGIMENS
Subjects will be randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio  to receive a single IM dose of MEDI8897 (N = 2,000) or 
placebo (N = 1,000). The MEDI8897 dose level will be stratified by [CONTACT_469032]: 50 mg MEDI8897 for infants < 5 kg or 100 mg MEDI8897 for infants ≥5 kg.
STATISTICAL METHODS
General Considerations:
Tabular summaries will be presented by [CONTACT_1570]. Categorical data will be summarized by [CONTACT_316745]. Continuous variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_9086]. Additional details of statistical analyses will be described in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). 
There will be 2 study cohorts: a primary cohort and a safety cohort. The primary cohort will include subjects 
from the NH2019, SH2020, and NH2020 enrollment seasons (enrollment was paused after one subject from NH2020 was enrolled due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic). The safety cohort will include subjects enrolled after the NH2020 enrollment season.
The Intent-to-treat (ITT) Population is defined as all subjects who are randomized. Subjects will be included 
in the treatment group corresponding to their randomized treatment. All analyses, with the exception of safety, 
MedImmune Protocol D5290C00004 (MELODY) Amendment 1
MEDI8897 01Feb2021; Final
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 8 of 76 Template 18.0will be performed on the ITT Population unless otherwise specified. Subjects in the ITT Population and from 
the primary cohort will be ITT Population 1 (ITT1). Subjects in the ITT Population and from the safety cohort will be ITT Population 2 (ITT2).
The As-treated Population will include all subjects who are randomized and who receive any amount of 
investigational product. Subjects will be included in the treatment group corresponding to the treatment actually received. All safety analyses will be performed on the As-treated Population. Subjects in the As-treated Population and from the primary cohort will be As-treated Population 1 (AT1). Subjects in the As-treated Population and from the safety cohort will be As-treated Population 2 (AT2).
Sample Size:
This Phase 3 study will enroll approximately  3,000 sub jects of whom approximately  2,000 w ill receive 
MEDI8897 and 1,000 will receive placebo. Th e 2,000 subjects to be dosed with MEDI8897 in this study, 
together with the 968 subjects dosed with MEDI8897 in the Phase 2b Study D5290C00003 and at least600 subjects dosed with MEDI8897 in the palivizumab-controlled Phase 2/[ADDRESS_601001] 99% power for the pr imary eff icacy e ndpoint. Reducing the sample size to 1,[ADDRESS_601002] 99% power to detect 70% relative risk reduction ( RRR), assuming a 
placebo group medically attended RSV LRTI incidence of 8% with a 2-sided α = 0.05.
The 70% RRR assumption is based on the Phase 2b Study D5290C00003 in which there was 70% RRR in the 
incidence of medically attended RSV LRTI (9.5% placebo, 2.6% MEDI8897; p < 0.001) and 79% RRR in the 
incidence of RSV hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (4.1% placebo, 0.8% MEDI8897; p < 0.001) in subjects who received MEDI8897 prophylaxis. In addition, the assumption is  supported by a placebo-controlled study in Native 
American term infants in which there was a  
 in infants who received motavizumab 
prophylaxis. In the event that the incidence rate in the placebo group drops due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic (eg, social distancing), the sample size of 1,[ADDRESS_601003] 90% power to detect 70% 
RRR if the placebo incidence rate is 4% or higher.
To evaluate risk, a sample size of 2,000 subjects exposed to MEDI8897 in this Phase 3 study will provide a
> 99% probability of observing at least one adverse event (AE) if the true event rate is 0.3%; if no AEs are observed, this study provides 98% confidence that the true event rate is < 0.2%.
Statistical Analyses:
There are 3 planned analyses for this study: the primary analysis, safety analysis, and final analysis. The 
primary analysis will be conducted after all randomized subjects (except for one subject enrolled in the NH2020 season) from the primary cohort have been  followed through Day 361 and will be the primary 
analysis for which the study is designed to assess efficacy. For the primary analysis, all efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK), ADA, and safety data collected for the primary cohort through at least Day [ADDRESS_601004] been 
followed through Day 151. For the safety analysis, in addition to the analyses conducted during the primary analysis based on the primary cohort, all available efficacy, PK, ADA, RSV neutralizing antibody, RSV serology, and safety data collected for the safety cohort will be analyzed (only descriptive summaries will be provided for the efficacy data collected for the safety cohort). The final analysis will be conducted when all subjects have completed the last visit of the study (ie,  Day 511). Given the largely reduced circulation of RSV 
due to the COVID-19 pandemic related measures, the efficacy analyses performed in the primary analysis for the primary cohort will serve the purpose of evaluating the efficacy of MEDI8897 in the study population.Although efficacy data will also be collected for the safety cohort, only descriptive summaries will be

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY [ADDRESS_601005] on the primary efficacy endpoint is demonstrated at the significance level of 2-sided 0.05. With that, the over all Type I e rror is controlled at 0.05. Therefore, no further multiplicity adjustment is 
necessary.
Primary Endpoint Analysis:
Primary Efficacy Analysis
The incidence of RSV LRTI (inpatient and outpatient) during [ADDRESS_601006] results (performed centrally via RT-PCR) and objective clinical LRTI criteria and will be presented 
by [CONTACT_1570]. For subjects with multiple medically attended RSV LRTI events, only the first occurrence will be used in the primary analysis.
The primary efficacy analysis of the primary endpoint will be conducted on ITT1. RSV LRTI that occurs 
through [ADDRESS_601007] variance will 
be used as the primary efficacy analysis model to compare the incidence of medically attended RSV LRTI between MEDI8897 and placebo, including treatment group, age at the time of randomization (ie, ≤ 3 months, 
>3  t o  ≤6 months, > 6 months), and dichotomous temperate hemispheres (NH and SH) as covariates. In 
addition, the 2-sided p-value and corresponding 2-side d 95% confidence interval on the relative risk will be 
provided from the model. RRR is defined as (1 - Pn/Ps) where Pn is the incidence of RSV LRTI through [ADDRESS_601008] dose in the placebo group generated by [CONTACT_10994]. Statistical significance will be achieved if the 2-sided p-value is ≤0.05. 
During blinded data review prior to database lock for  the primary analysis, it was decided to drop the 
stratification factor hemisphere from the full model due to no incidence of medically attended RSV LRTI events through [ADDRESS_601009] dose for SH in the primary cohort, which would cause a known convergence or estimation issue. Similar consideration also applies to other analyses for the primary efficacy endpoint, where hemisphere will be dropped from the corresponding models.
Additional Analyses of the Primary Endpoint
A Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel approach stratified by [CONTACT_469033] (ie, ≤ 3 months, 
>3t o  ≤ 6 months, > 6 months) will be used to compare the incidence of RSV LRTI through [ADDRESS_601010] RSV LRTI may be 
performed as a supplementary analysis.
An analysis may also include all RSV positive LRTI endpoints, using results from either the central laboratory 
or local laboratory.
Different approaches to handle missing data (ie, early discontinuation and no RSV LRTI prior to 
discontinuation) may be considered for supplementary analyses. Additional analyses may be performed to 
adjust duration of efficacy follow-up and to assess the efficacy within subgroups. These analyses will be described in the SAP.
The incidence of medically attended RSV LRTI through [ADDRESS_601011] dose will also be summarized by 
[CONTACT_469034]2.

Efficacy
The incidence of RSV LRTI hospi[INVESTIGATOR_151400] [ADDRESS_601012] will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570]. Other safety assessments will include:
• Occurrence of AESIs to include targeted AEs of hypersensitivity (including anaphylaxis), 
thrombocytopenia, and immune complex disease (eg, vasculitis, endocarditis, neuritis, glomerulonephritis) following investigational product administration.
• Occurrence of NOCDs following investigational product administration
Pharmacokinetics Analysis
Following a single dose of MEDI8897, individual MEDI8897 serum concentration data will be tabulated by 
[CONTACT_316750]. PK parameters, eg, C max, AUC, apparent clearance, and 
terminal half-life, will be estimated using non-compartmental analysi s, if data permit.
Anti-drug Antibody Analysis
The incidence of ADA to MEDI8897 will be assessed and summarized by [CONTACT_316751]. The ADA titer will be listed by [CONTACT_316752]. The impact of ADA on PK, efficacy, and association with TEAEs and TESAEs will be assessed. These summaries will be conducted on the overall As-treated Population, AT1, and AT2, unless specified otherwise.
Exploratory Endpoint Analyses:
HRU and Caregiver Burden
The magnitude of HRU (eg, number of admissions to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_316672]; number of 
subjects who require respi[INVESTIGATOR_316673]; number and types of outpatient visits, eg, ER, urgent care, outpatient clinic; and number of prescription and over-the-countermedications and duration of use) will be summarized overall by [CONTACT_1570], and for the following subgroups: subjects with at least one medically attended LRTI caused by [CONTACT_937]-PCR-confirmed RSV, subjects with medically  attended LRTI not caused by [CONTACT_4510], and sub jects with non-protocol defined LRTIs, which may 
be further broken down by [CONTACT_469035]. These summaries will be conducted on ITT1 and ITT2 (if data permit).
Caregiver burden (eg, caregiver missed work days, subject absence from day care) for subjects with medically 
attended LRTI caused by [CONTACT_937]-PCR-confirmed RSV will be summarized by [CONTACT_469034]1 and ITT2 (if data permit).
RSV Neutralizing Antibody and RSV Serology
RSV neutralizing antibody levels afforded by [CONTACT_46054]8897 will be compared to maternal RSV neutralizing 
antibody levels and those elicited following infection in the placebo group.
RSV seroresponses will be evaluated as a measure of RSV exposure in the placebo and MEDI8897 groups.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 18 of 76 Template 18.01 INTRODUCTION
Prevention of respi[INVESTIGATOR_4345] (RSV) illnesses in all infants is a major public health 
priority. However, despi[INVESTIGATOR_330802] 50 years of attempted vaccine development, there are no 
licensed vaccines. As there is no approved RSV prophylaxis for the broader population of healthy infants and no tr eatment for RSV, the current management for these patients when 
they acquire serious RSV illness is supportive care. 
The only currently approved prophylaxis for RSV, palivizumab (Synagis
®), was developed by
[CONTACT_469037]-risk children: preterm infants ≤35 weeks 
gestational age (GA), children with chronic lung disease (CLD) of prematurity, and children with haemodynamically significant congenital heart disease (CHD). In addition, further restrictions have been implemented by [CONTACT_469038]. For example, in the [LOCATION_002] of America ([LOCATION_003]) per the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines, palivizumab is not recommended for healthy preterm infants 
≥29 weeks GA ( American Academy of Pediatrics, 2014 ). In the [LOCATION_008] ([LOCATION_006]), 
palivizumab is recommended by [CONTACT_469039] 
(JCVI) for preterm infants with CLD or haemodynamically significant, acyanotic CHD based on the GA at birth and chronological age at the start of the RSV season ( JCVI, 2010a , 
2010b ).

al, 2009 ; Hall, 2012 ; Madhi et al, 2006 ; Shay et al, 1999 ; Shi et al, 2017 ; Stockman et al, 
2012 ). All children, including healthy term infants, are at risk for severe RSV LRTI with 
primary RSV infection during infancy. Ninety percent of children are infected with RSV in the first 2 years of life and up to 40% of those will have LRTI with the initial epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2014 ; Greenough et al, 2001 ; Meissner, 2003 ; Parrott et al, 
1973 ). RSV LRTI, characterized predominantly as bronchiolitis or pneumonia, represents a 
serious illness with acute and perhaps long-term consequences to the developi[INVESTIGATOR_316678] ( Blanken et al, 2013 ). It is estimated that RSV causes up to 90% of 
childhood bronchiolitis and up to 40% of pediatric pneumonias ( Hall, 2001 ). In 2015, an 
estimated 33.1 million (uncertainty range, 21.6 to 50.3 million) new epi[INVESTIGATOR_448815]-associated LRTI occurred worldwide in  children younger than 5 years (28% of LRTI 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]), with approximately 3.2 million (range, 2.7 to 3.8 million) epi[INVESTIGATOR_468960], leading to 59,600 (range , 48,000 to 74,500) in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_241900] ( Shi et al, 
2017 ). Children younger than 1 year of age had an estimated 2.3 million hospi[INVESTIGATOR_614]. 
The overall mortality due to RSV LRTI was estimated to be as high as 118,200 (uncertainty range, 94,600 to 149,400 ( Shi et al, 2017 ).

department visits, especially in healthy infants.  In children < 5 years of age in the [LOCATION_003], RSV 
is estimated to cause 1 in 13 private practice visits, 1 in 38 emergency department visits, and 
1 in 334 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] ( Hall, 2012 ). Another study demonstrated that in otherwise healthy 
term infants < 12 months of age in a Medicaid program (1995 - 2003), 13.3% had an outpatient visit, 6.2% had an emergency depa rtment visit, and 5.5% were hospi[INVESTIGATOR_468961] ( Carroll et al, 2008 ). Paramore and colleagues reported high rates of outpatient 
RSV LRTI among infants and young children, ranging from 157.5 to 252.0 per 1,000 children < 1 year of age ( Paramore et al, 2010 ). This study also showed that outpatient RSV LRTI rates 
for late preterm (33 to 36 weeks GA) infants ranged from 183.3 to 245.7 per 1,000 infants, 
with rates for full-term infants ranging from 128.8 to 171.3 per 1,000 infants.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_468962]; the rates for infants within the first year of life were invariably the highest, 19 to 22 per 1,000 children, consistent with the [LOCATION_003] and Canadian data ( Jansen et al, 2007 ; 
van Gageldonk-Lafeber et al, 2005 ; Weigl et al, 2001 ). In addition, RSV hospi[INVESTIGATOR_316683] 0 to 3 years of age were found to be 4 and 9 times greater than the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_316684], respectively(König et al, 2004 ).
Similarly, high rates of RSV hospi[INVESTIGATOR_468963]. For infants 
< 6 months of age, the incidence (95% confidence interval [CI]) of severe LRTI was

159.9) per 1,000 in those born at 32 to 35 weeks GA, and 142.3 (range, 89.50 to 212.0) per 1,000 in those born at < 32 weeks GA ( Madhi et al, 2006 ).
1.2 MEDI8897 Background
MEDI8897 is briefly described below. Refer to the current Investigator’s Brochure for details. 
MEDI8897 is a recombinant human immunoglobulin G1 kappa (IgG1 κ) monoclonal antibody 
(mAb) directed against the prefusion conformat ion of the RSV F protein. The antibody has 
been engineered with a triple amino acid substitution (YTE; M257Y/S259T/T261E
[M252Y/S254T/T256E, according to the European Union (EU) numbering system]) in the 
fragment crystallizable (Fc) region to prolong the terminal half-life (t 1/2), which is expected to 
provide protection from serious RSV diseas e for the duration of the RSV season. MEDI8897
neutralizes RSV by [CONTACT_316754] F protein at a site distinct from that bound by [CONTACT_316755]. In preclinical studies, MEDI8897 was > 150-fold more potent than palivizumab in vitro and approximately 9-fold more potent than palivizumab in vivo in the cotton rat model ( Zhu et al, 2017 ). MEDI8897 is currently under development by

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY [ADDRESS_601021] all 
infants from RSV disease based on an improvement in potency and the extended t
1/2that is 
expected to support once-per-RSV-season dosing.
1.3 Summary of Nonclinical Experience
The potential clinical ut ility of MED I8897 and dose predictions of the antibody were 
evaluated in the cotton rat model of RSV infection. The pharmacokinetics (PK) of 1G7, the non-YTE version of MEDI8897, was evaluated in cotton rats following a single intramuscular (IM) dose of 0.25 to 3.0 mg/kg. Serum concentrations increased dose proportionally across the entire dose range with a terminal-phase elimination t
1/2of approximately 1 day. In cotton rats, 
a serum concentration of 6.8 μg/mL resulted in a 3-log reduction in lung RSV titers and for 
Phase 2b was identified as the target serum concentration to maintain in children to provide 
antiviral activity against RSV over a typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] 5-month RSV season.
The YTE amino acid substitutions introduced into MEDI8897 do not impact RSV neutralizing 
activity when compared to th e parental mAb, 1G7. MEDI8 897/1G7 showed potent antiviral 
activity in vitro against RSV A and B laboratory strains, clinical isolates, as well as 
palivizumab-resistant viruses. MEDI8897/1G7 was > 150-fold more potent than palivizumab in vitro against the laboratory strains and > 50-fold more potent than palivizumab against clinical isolates based on the median half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC
50)(Zhu et al, 2017 ). 
Toxicity, toxicokinetics (TK), and immunogenicity of MEDI8897 were evaluated in a G ood 
Laboratory Practice-compliant repeat-dose in travenous (IV) and IM toxicology study 
conducted in cynomolgus monkeys. Cynomolgus monkeys represent a pharmacologically relevant model for nonclinical safety assessment based on similar binding of MEDI8897 to cynomolgus monkey neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) compared to human FcRn. Toxicology studies in cynomolgus monkeys indicate that there is no evidence of MEDI8897 toxicity in these animal models.  
 
 
 
 
 
Overall, data from nonclinical studies do not reveal any MEDI8897-related 
safety concerns.

1.[ADDRESS_601022]-time-in-human Study D5290C00001 ( Griffin et al, 2017 ) was a Phase 1a, 
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose- escalation study to evaluate the safety, 
tolerability, and PK of MEDI8897 compared to placebo. A total of 136 subjects were randomized and received a single dose of MEDI8897 (6 subjects each at doses of 300 mg IV, 1,000 mg IV, 3,000 mg IV, and 100 mg IM; 78 subjects at 300 mg IM) or placebo (34 subjects). The mean t
1/2of MEDI8897 ranged from 85 to 117 days across the IV and IM 
dose groups confirming the predicted 3- to 4-fold increase in the t 1/2of MEDI8897 compared 
to a standard immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody. The safety profile of MEDI8897 was 
favorable, with similar proportions of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) reported in 
placebo (61.8%) and MEDI8897 recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (62.7%). Two treatment-emergent serious adverse events (TESAEs; gunshot wound and appendicitis) were reported in [ADDRESS_601023] were reported in 29.4% of placebo recipi[INVESTIGATOR_842] 17.6% of MEDI8897 recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. The most frequent TEAEs in the MEDI8897 total group included upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092] (URTI; 18.6%), headache (8.8%), 
urinary tract infection (5.9%), dermatitis contact (4.9%), musculoskeletal pain (4.9%), nausea

(17.6%), URTI (8.8%), nausea (5.9%), increased blood creatine phosphokinase level (5.9%), 
and paresthesia (5.9%). There were no events designated as an adverse event of special interest (AESI) or new onset chronic disease (NOCD). There were no deaths. No safety signals in this healthy adult population were observed. Post-baseline ADA was detected in 13.7% of adults receiving MEDI8897 and 15.2% of adults in the placebo group. On Day 361, 
ADA was detected in 5.3% of subjects in the MEDI8897 total group and 10.7% of subjects in the placebo group. The highest titer at Day 361 was 1:[ADDRESS_601024]-time-in-infant Study D5290C00002 ( Domachowske et al, 2018 ) was a Phase 1b/2a,

be receiving palivizumab, allowing for a placebo comparator group. A total of 89 infants from sites in the [LOCATION_003], Chile, and South Africa were randomized and received a single IM dose of MEDI8897 (10, 25, or 50 mg; N = 71) or placebo (N = 18) and were followed for approximately 360 days after dosing. 
A total of 66 subjects (93%) in the MEDI8897 group and 17 subjects (94.4%) in the placebo 
group reported at least 1 TEAE. No safety signals were observed with ascending dose levels. The majority of the events were mild or moderate in severity; only 2 TEAEs were assessed as ≥ Grade [ADDRESS_601025] by [CONTACT_1275]. There were no deaths, AESIs, or NOCDs in any dose group. 
Three MEDI8897 subjects (4.2%) had a total of [ADDRESS_601026] by [CONTACT_093]; no subjects in the placebo group had a TESAE. One infant who received 25 mg of MEDI8897 was hospi[INVESTIGATOR_468964]. Real-time 
reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reactio n (RT-PCR) testing from th e central laboratory 
was negative for RSV (but positive for human metapneumovirus [hMPV]); the illness resolved.  
 
 
 
The most frequently reported TEAEs for the MEDI8897 group were URTI (69.0%), 
gastroenteritis (29.6%), cough (25.4%), pyrexia (22.5%), and otitis media (21.1%). There 
were no trends by [CONTACT_469040]8897 for these events. The most frequently reported TEAEs in the placebo group were URTI (66.7%), anemia (33.3%), gastroenteritis (22.2%), cough (22.2%), and otitis media (22.2%). Skin rashes (defined as adverse events [AEs] that coded to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activi ties (MedDRA) preferred terms of dermatitis, 
dermatitis allergic, dermatitis atopic, dermatitis contact, dermatitis diaper, dry skin, eczema, rash, and rash papular) were reported for 38.9% of subjects in the placebo group and 47.9% of subjects in the MEDI8897 group. No skin events were consistent with hypersensitivity. 
MEDI8897 exhibited a less-than-dose-proportional exposure increase between the 10 and 
25 mg doses; however, exposure increase was dose proportional between 25 and 50 mg doses. 
Following a single IM dose of 10, 25, or 50 mg, the estimated t½ of MEDI8897 ranged from 62.5 to 72.9 days. On Day 151, 87% of the MEDI8897 serum concentrations following the 50 mg IM dose were above the EC
90threshold of 6.8 μg/mL.
ADA was not detected in any subject at Day 151. Post-baseline ADA was detected at Day 361

None of the post-baseline MEDI8897 ADA-positive subjects were ADA positive at baseline; only one subject (in the placebo group) was ADA-positive at baseline. The highest titer detected was 1:25,600 (observed in 2 subjects [2.8%]). The [ADDRESS_601028] between Day 151 and Day 361. Serum anti-RSV neutralizing antibody titer s increased dose-dependently following 
administration of MEDI8897 and were higher than placebo by [CONTACT_2006] 8 and through Day 151. Serum MEDI8897 concentrations were correlated with serum anti-RSV neutralizing antibody across all the dose levels, confirming anti-RSV activity of MEDI8897.
1.4.3 Study D5290C00003
The Phase 2b Study D5290C00003 was a rando mized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
single-dose study that evaluated the safety, efficacy, PK, and ADA response of MEDI8897 in 
healthy pr eterm infants. Subjects were 29 to < [ADDRESS_601029] RSV season 
who would not receive RSV prophylaxis based on the JCVI, AAP, or other local or national guidelines. Overall, 1,453 subjects were randomized 2:1 to receive a single dose of 50 mg IM MEDI8897 (n = 969) or placebo (n = 484). A total of 1,447 subjects were dosed, including 966 subjects in the MEDI8897 group and 481 subjects in the placebo group. Subjects were followed for approximately 360 days after dosing. The study was completed on 06Dec2018 (last subject last visit). 
Results from the planned primary analysis conducted after all randomized subjects who 
remained in the study completed the Day 151 visit demonstrated a statistically significant 
relative risk reduction (RRR) in the inciden ce of the primary endpoint of RSV-confirmed 
LRTI (inpatient and outpatient) and the secondary endpoint of RSV hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
 
 
 
 
Based on the primary analysis, the safety profile for the MEDI8897 group was comparable to 
the placebo group, with no identified risks. Overall,  of subjects in the MEDI8897 group and  of subjects in the placebo group had at least 1 TEAE. The majority of the TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity. TEAEs ≤[ADDRESS_601030] dose occurred in 2.5% of 
subjects in both groups. In comparison to the placebo group, the MEDI8897 group had a

TEAEs≥Grade 3 in severity (12.3% vs 7.4%, respectively), and TESAEs (16.7% vs 10.4%, 
respectively). The most common TESAEs, based on the MEDI8897 group, were bronchiolitis (2.1% MEDI8897, 4.2% placebo), LRTI (1.4% MEDI8897, 2.7% placebo), pneumonia 
(1.4% MEDI8897, 2.1% p lacebo), and bronchitis (1.2% MEDI8897, 2.3% placebo). None of 
the TESAEs were considered related to study treatment by [CONTACT_093]. Five deaths were 
reported during the study through Day 361, in cluding 2 subjects (0.2%) in the MEDI8897 
group and 3 subjects (0.6%) in the placebo group. None of the deaths were related to study drug according to the investigator.
Overall, the incidence of investigational product-related TEAEs (MEDI8897 2.3%, placebo 
2.1%); AESIs, including hypersensitivity, imm une complex disease, and thrombocytopenia 
(MEDI8897 0.5%, placebo 0.6%); and NOCDs (MEDI8897 0.3%, placebo 0.8%) was low and generally comparable between the placebo and MEDI8897 groups. AESIs were reported 
in 5 subjects ([ADDRESS_601032] with petechiae) in the 
MEDI8897 group and 3 subjects (rash or rash papular) in the placebo group. All events were Grade 1 in severity. The TEAE of petechiae that was reported as an AESI was 1-day duration and was reported by [CONTACT_469041] d on description by [CONTACT_7071]. There were no 
laboratory assessments for the petechiae.
TEAEs that involved the skin and subcutaneous tissues (including diaper rash) were collected 
as skin reactions, with a few exceptions for skin reactions that could be definitively diagnosed such as impetigo, varicella, and scabies.  
Following a single fixed 50 mg IM dose of MEDI8897, over 95% of measurable Day 151 
concentrations were greater than the nonclinical EC
90target of 6.8 μg/mL. The median area 
under the concentration-time curve from time 0 to infinity (AUC 0-∞) and estimated apparent 
t½ were 5.3 day.mg/mL (range, 3.2 to 10.2 day.mg/mL) and 56.5 days (range, 46.8 to 81.1 days), respectively. 
Overall, the rate and titers of ADA were low, and in ADA-positive subjects there was no 
effect on PK or safety. Of the subjects who had serum samples available for testing, ADA was detected post baseline in 4.3% (40/921) of subjects in the MEDI8897 group and 
2.8% (13/466) of subjects in the placebo group; with less than 5% of subjects in either group 
being ADA positive at any visit. ADA titers ranged from 1:50 to 1:3,200 in the MEDI8897 group and 1:50 to 1:[ADDRESS_601033]-baseline ADA positive, ADA targeting the YTE domain was observed in 4/17 subjects on Day 151 and 10/15 on Day 361.

based on improved potency and an extended t
1/2, which is expected to support once-per-RSV-
season dosing.
Based on advice from the [LOCATION_002] Food and Drug Administration (US FDA), a pi[INVESTIGATOR_61493] 2b study was conducted in healthy preterm infants born 29 to 35 weeks GA to demonstrate efficacy and safety  of MEDI8897 in healthy preter m infants who are not eligible 
to receive palivizumab according to AAP or other local guidelines. Based on favorable benefit-risk results following the primary analysis, this Phase 3 study in h ealthy infants

Declaration of Helsinki and are consistent with International Council for Harmonisation (ICH)/Good Clinical Practice (GCP), and applicable regulatory requirements.
Prevention of RSV illness in all infants is a major public health priority. However, despi[INVESTIGATOR_468965], there is no safe and effective vaccine for these children. As there is no approved RSV prophylaxis for the broader population of healthy

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY [ADDRESS_601039] se rious RSV disease; however, this has not yet 
been proven in this population.
MEDI8897 has no endogenous targets, and no safety  concerns were identified in nonclinical 
studies. The potential risks are based primarily  on common safety risks observed with any 
immunoglobulin, including mAbs such as palivizumab. These potential risks include, but are not limited to, hypersensitivity (including anaphylaxis), immune complex disease, thrombocytopenia, and injection site reactions. To date, there have been no observed events of 
anaphylaxis, significant hypersensitivity reactions, immune complex disease, or 
thrombocytopenia attributable to MEDI8897 in the clinical studies. Nonetheless, subjects in MEDI8897 clinical studies will be monitored for important potential risks, and routine pharmacovigilance and risk minimizatio n activities will be performed accordingly.
1.7 Research Hypotheses
1.7.1 Primary Hypothesis
Compared to placebo, a single IM MEDI8897 dose,  50 mg if weight < 5 kg or 100 mg if 
weight ≥ 5 kg, will be eff icacious in reducing medically attended LRTI caused by [CONTACT_937]-PCR-
confirmed RSV in healthy late preterm and term infants born ≥ [ADDRESS_601040] RSV season, and the safety profile will be acceptable.
1.7.2 Secondary Hypotheses
!There will be a reduction in the incidence of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_468953]-PCR-
confirmed RSV
!The predicted serum exposure of MEDI8897 will be adequate for the duration of the RSV 
season
!ADA to MEDI8897 will not significantly impact the serum concentrations or safety of 
MEDI8897 through [ADDRESS_601041] dosing (ie, during a 5-month RSV season)

3 STUDY DESIGN
3.1 Description of the Study
3.1.1 Overview
Study D5290C00004 (MELODY) is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_9205] [ADDRESS_601043] RSV season ( Figure 1 ). 
The population to be enrolled is healthy late preterm and term infants born ≥ 35 weeks 0 days 
GA who would not receive RSV prophylaxis based on the AAP or other local or national guidelines. The study will be conducted over 5 respi[INVESTIGATOR_467031] (3 northern

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 29 of 76 Template 18.0hemisphere [NH] and 2 southern hemisphere [ SH] seasons) to better characterize RSV cases 
over multiple seasons. A total of approximately 3,000 infants will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive a single 50-mg (if < 5 kg weight at the time of dosing) or 100-mg (if ≥ 5 kg weight 
at the time of dosing) IM dose of MED I8897 (N = 2,000) or placebo (N = 1,000). The study 
may continue to enroll through 5 enrollment seas ons even if the target of 3,000 subjects is 
met. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_150991] (NH, SH) and by [CONTACT_469045] ( ≤ 3 months, > 3 to ≤6 months, > 6 months). Enrollment of infants 
> 6 months of age will be limited to approximately  500. The study will comprise 2 cohorts: a 
primary cohort (N = ~1,500) and a complementary safe ty cohort (hereafter referred to as the 
safety cohort; N = ~1,500) for a total of approxima tely 3,000 subjects. Given the largely 
reduced circulation of RSV due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pand emic
related measures, the primary cohort will include subjects from the NH2019, SH2020, and NH2020 enrollment seasons. The safety cohort will include subjects enrolled after the 
NH2020 enrollment season. The efficacy analyses performed in the primary analysis for the 
primary cohort will serve the purpose of evaluat ing the efficacy of MEDI8897 in the study 
population. Although effi cacy data will also be collected for the safety cohort, only descriptive 
summaries will be provided and there is no intent to pool the efficacy data from the safety cohort with that from the primary cohort. Both th e primary and the safety cohorts, individually 
and combined, will serve the purpose of evaluat ing the safety of MEDI8897. All subjects will 
be followed for approximately [ADDRESS_601044].
Subjects will be monitored throughout the study for LRTI. All subjects seeking medical 
attention for a respi[INVESTIGATOR_4375] (in either the inpatient or outpatient setting) will be evaluated 
for the occurrence of LRTI. All subjects found to have an LRTI and all subjects who require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a respi[INVESTIGATOR_28299], even if there is not a diagnosis of LRTI, should have 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_468967]. Samples should be 
collected for all of these events (even those not meeting the protocol definition of LRTI). Subjects who have a primary hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416] (ie, upper or lower tract) or a respi[INVESTIGATOR_316667] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or who seek outpatient medical 
attention (including emergency room [ER] visits) for a lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_4375], will be 
assessed clinically for the presence of LRTI and for RSV by [CONTACT_469031][INVESTIGATOR_171919]. 
In addition to the clinical assessment of LRTI, there is a protocol definition using objective 
criteria for the determination of a medically attended protocol-defined LRTI. To meet the protocol-defined endpoint of medically attended LRTI, subjects with signs of LRTI must have documented at least one physical exam finding of rhonchi, rales, crackles, or wheeze AND at least one of the following clinical signs:

Subjects will be randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive a single IM dose of MEDI8897 
(N = 2,000) or placebo (N = 1,000). The MEDI8897 dose level will be stratified by [CONTACT_469047]: 50 mg MEDI8897 for infants < 5 kg or 100 mg MEDI8897 for 
infants ≥5k g .
3.2 Rationale for Dose, Population, and Endpoints
3.2.1 Dose Rationale
A single fixed 50-mg IM dose was shown to be efficacious in the Phase 2b Study 
D5290C00003 in preterm infants (29 to < 35 w eeks GA) in their first RSV season (see 
Section 1.4). Model-based analyses of the Phase 2b clinical PK and efficacy data identified a 
projected serum AUC 0-∞of  as the protective exposure threshold. The risk of 
medically attended RSV-confirmed LRTI over the course of the RSV season was significantly 
lower in infants with higher projected AUC 0-∞. Infants with AUC 0-∞above 13.4 day.mg/mL 
had a statistically significantly higher probabi lity of protection base d on exposure-response 
analysis using Cox proportional hazard regression.  
 
 Additionally, 
a cut-point analysis of the weight-normalized  doses of all treated infants revealed that a 
10 mg/kg dose was the corresponding clinically efficacious and protective threshold dose. Henceforth, based on these analyses, a stratified fixed dosing strategy by [CONTACT_469048]8897 serum concentrations above the target AUC throughout the RSV season. Based on dose optimization analysis designed to maximize the proportion of infants with clinically efficacious  MEDI8897 serum exposure, a single fixed 
50-mg IM dose is proposed for infants < [ADDRESS_601045] RSV season while a single fixed 100-mg dose is proposed for infants weighing ≥ [ADDRESS_601046] evaluated in healthy preterm infants 29 to < 35 weeks GA (per US FDA advice) in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_9205] 2b Study D5290C00003 with favorable benefit-risk results following the primary analysis (see Section 1.4). This study proposes to further extend the population to healthy late 
preterm and term infants ( ≥35 weeks GA) to meet the overall goal of evaluating MEDI8897 
for prevention of RSV disease in all infants entering their first RSV season.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 33 of 76 Template [IP_ADDRESS] Rationale for Endpoints
The endpoints for this Phase 3 pi[INVESTIGATOR_468969] 2b pi[INVESTIGATOR_2397]. The primary endpoint is the incidence of medically 
attended LRTI (inpatient and outpatient) due to RT-PCR-confirmed RSV through 150 days 
after dosing (ie, during a typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] 5-month RSV season). This endpoint will examine the efficacy of MEDI8897 compared to placebo in preve nting LRTI due to RSV. RSV results in a 
significant burden of disease consisting of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], visits to the ER, and visits to outpatient clinics. This primary endpoint is designed to allow the capture of the total burden of RSV disease and the efficacy of MEDI8897 in reducing that burden. A separate secondary endpoint of RSV hospi[INVESTIGATOR_468970]. 
Safety endpoints include TEAEs, TESAEs, AESIs (defined as hypersensitivity including 
anaphylaxis, immune complex disease, and thrombocytopenia), NOCDs, and concomitant 
medications. 
Serum concentration of MEDI8897 at selected time points will be evaluated as a secondary 
endpoint to confirm that ade quate serum exposures are maintained for at least 5 months after 
dosing. Additionally, serum concentration data will be used to characterize the PK of MEDI8897 in infants using a population PK approach separately. For infants who require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_468971], an additional serum sample for measurement of MEDI8897 concentration and ADA will be obtained contemporaneous with time of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Exposure-response analysis will be performed to relate MEDI8897 
serum concentrations and efficacy e ndpoints (LRTI including RSV-associated 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]).
To determine MEDI8897 serum levels post dosing and correlation with the development of 
ADA, serum concentrations will be measured up to [ADDRESS_601047] dosing, when MEDI8897 levels are expected to be low. 
Exploratory endpoints will examine magnitude of healthcare resource utilization (HRU) and 
caregiver burden due to RSV illness in the studied population. This will allow the 
determination of social and economic resources that are required for infants who have 
RSV-confirmed LRTI. Serum anti-RSV neutralizing antibody levels will be evaluated for correlation with serum MEDI8897 levels and maternally-derived RSV neutralizing antibody 
levels in the placebo group. RSV serology will be  performed to identify potential exposure to 
RSV. To monitor for RSV resistance, the F protein from collected RSV isolates w ill be 
genetically characterized and novel variants  will be phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_468972] I8897 and palivizumab neutralization. The incidence of medically 
attended LRTI (inpatient and outpatient) due to RT-PCR-confirmed RSV from Day [ADDRESS_601048] Day 151.

A master log of all consented subjects will be maintained at the site and will document all 
screening failures (ie, subjects who are consented but do not meet study eligibility criteria 
and/or are not randomized), including the reason(s) for screening failure.
Subjects who fail to meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria (ie, screening failures) should not be
randomized or administered investigational product. The investigator must consult with the sponsor before a subject who has failed screening may be considered for rescreening.

medical attention for a respi[INVESTIGATOR_4375] (in eithe r the inpatient or outpatient setting) will be 
evaluated for the occurrence of LRTI ( Table 6 ). All subjects found to have an LRTI and all 
subjects who require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416], even if there is not a diagnosis of LRTI, should have respi[INVESTIGATOR_468980]. Samples should be collected for all of these respi[INVESTIGATOR_468981]. Subjects who have a primary hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416] (ie, upper or lower tract) or a respi[INVESTIGATOR_316667] a 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or who seek outpatient medical attention (including ER visits) for a lower 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_4375], will be assessed clinically for the presence of LRTI and for RSV by [CONTACT_469050][INVESTIGATOR_171919]. Testing for RSV will be performed 
using the US FDA-cleared and CE-marked in vitro diagnostic real-time RT-PCR assay (Lyra RSV + hMPV assay; Quidel Corporation, San Diego, CA, www.qui del.com). A diagnosis of 
RSV LRTI requires having a respi[INVESTIGATOR_468958]-PCR assay.
In addition to the clinical assessment of LRTI, there is a protocol definition using objective 
criteria for the determination of a medically attended protocol-defined RSV LRTI. To meet 
the protocol-defined endpoint of medically atte nded RSV LRTI, subjects with signs of LRTI 
must have documented at least one physical exam finding of rhonchi, rales, crackles, or 
wheeze AND at least one of the following clinical signs:
•Increased respi[INVESTIGATOR_316670] (age: < 2 months, ≥ 60 breaths/min; 2 to 6 months, 
≥50 breaths/min; > 6 months, ≥40 breaths/min), OR
•Hypoxemia (in room air: oxygen saturation < 95% at altitudes ≤ 1,800 meters or < 92% at 
altitudes > 1,800 meters), OR
•Clinical signs of severe respi[INVESTIGATOR_3765] (eg, acute hypoxic or ventilatory failure, new onset apnea, nasal flaring, intercostal, subcostal or supraclavicular retractions, grunting) or dehydration secondary to inadequate oral intake due to respi[INVESTIGATOR_1506] (need for IV

MEDI8897 01Feb2021; Final
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY [ADDRESS_601076].
Subjects will be randomized at a 2:1 ratio to receive MEDI8897 (N = 2,000) or placebo 
(N = 1,000). Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_150991] (NH and SH) and by [CONTACT_469030] (ie, ≤3 months, > 3 to ≤ 6 months, > 6 months). Enrollment of 
infants > 6 months of age will be limited to approximately 500.
The procedure for using IWRS is as follows:
!The investigator or designee contacts the IWRS and provides the SID number and 
subject’s baseline characteristic(s) used to verify that it is the same subject
!Placebo (provided by [CONTACT_3725]) or a vial from a ME DI8897 kit will be assigned to the subject
!Confirmation of this information is sent to the unblinded investigational product manager 
who prepares the investigational product to be dispensed to the subject per the response 
system and records the appropriate information in the investigational product 
accountability log
Investigational product (MEDI8897 or placebo) mu st be administered the same day the 
investigational product is assigned. Total in-use storage time from needle puncture of the investigational product vial to administration should not exceed [ADDRESS_601077]/legal representative nor the investigator or any of the site staff who are involved in the 
treatment or clinical evaluation of the subjects will be aware of the treatment received (ICH E9). In the event that treatment allocation for a subject becomes known to the 
investigator or other blinded study staff involved in the management of study subjects, the 
sponsor must be notified immediately . If the treatment allocation for a subject needs to be

MEDI8897 01Feb2021; Final
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY [ADDRESS_601078] notify the sponsor 
immediately . The site will maintain a written plan detailing which staff members are 
blinded/unblinded and the process of investigational product administration used to maintain the blind.
Details of maintaining the double-blind setting until database lock for the primary and safety 
analyses are provided in Section 4.8.1 .
4.6.3 Methods for Unblinding
[IP_ADDRESS] Unblinding in the Event of a Medical Emergency 
In the event of a medical emergency, the investigator may unblind an individual subject’s 
investigational product allocation. Instructions for unblinding an individual subject’s investigational product allocation are containe d in the IWRS manual. In general, unblinding 
should only occur if management of the medical emergency would be different based on the subject having received investigational product. In the majority of cases, the management of a 
medical emergency would be the same whether or not investigational product was received by 
[CONTACT_423]. If this was the case, the investigational product allocation should not be unblinded.
MedImmune retains the right to unblind the treatment allocation for SAEs that are unexpected 
and are suspected to be causally related to an investigational product and that potentially require expedited reporting to regulatory authorities.
4.7 Restrictions During the Study and Concomitant Treatment(s)
The investigator must be informed as soon as possible about any medication taken from the 
time of screening until the end of the clinical phase of the study (final study visit). Any 
concomitant medication(s), including herbal preparations, taken during the study will be 
recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF).
4.7.1 Permitted Concomitant Medications
Investigators may prescribe concomitant medications or treatments deemed necessary to provide ade quate supportive care including routine vitamins and iron.
4.7.2 Prohibited Concomitant Medications
Use of concomitant medications including OT C medications (except fo r routine vitamins and 
iron), herbal supplements, etc from Day [ADDRESS_601079] dose is discouraged. Subjects’ 
legal representatives must be instructed not to administer any medications, including OTCproducts, without first consulting with the investigator.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 51 of 76 Template 18.04.8 Statistical Evaluation
4.8.1 General Considerations
There will be 2 study cohorts: a primary cohort and a safety cohort. The primary cohort will 
include subjects from the NH2019, SH2020, and NH2020 enrollment seasons (enrollment was 
paused after one subject from the NH2020 was enrolled due to the impact of the COVID-19 
pandemic). The safety cohort will include subjects en rolled after th e NH2020 enrollment 
season.
There are 3 planned analyses for this study: the primary analysis, safety analysis, and final 
analysis. The primary analysis will be conducted after all randomized subjects (except for one subject enrolled in the NH2020 season) from the primary c ohort have been followed 
through Day [ADDRESS_601080] been followed through Day 151. For 
the safety analysis, in addition to the analyses conducted during the primary analysis based on the primary cohort, all available efficacy, PK, ADA, RSV neutralizing antibody, RSV serology, and safety data collected for the safety cohort will be analyzed (only descriptive summaries will be provided for the efficacy data collected for the safety cohort). The final analysis will be conducted when all subjects have completed the last visit of the study (ie, Day 511). Given the largely reduced circulati on of RSV due to the COVID-19 pandemic
related measures, the efficacy analyses performed in the primary analysis for the primary 
cohort will serve the purpose of evaluating the efficacy of MEDI8897 in the study population. 
Although efficacy data will also be collected for the safety cohort, only descriptive summaries will be provided and there is no intent to pool the efficacy data from the safety cohort with that from the primary c ohort. Bot h the primary and the safety cohorts, individually and 
combined, will serve the purpose of evaluating the safety of MEDI8897.
Tabular summaries will be presented by [CONTACT_1570]. Categorical data will be summarized 
by [CONTACT_96776]. Continuous variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_9086]. Addi tional details of statistical analyses will be 
described in the Statis tical Analysis Plan (SAP). 
The Intent-to-treat (ITT) Population will include all subjects who are randomized. In this 
population, data w ill be analyzed according to the randomized treatment. All analyses, with 
the exception of safety, will be performed on th e ITT Population unless otherwise specified.
Subjects in the ITT Population and from the primary cohort will be ITT Population 1 (ITT1). 
Subjects in the ITT Population and from the safety cohort will be ITT Population 2 (ITT2).
The As-treated Population will include all subjects who are randomized and who receive any 
amount of investigational product. In this population, data will be analyzed according to the

MEDI8897 01Feb2021; Final
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 52 of 76 Template 18.0treatment actually received. All safety anal yses will be performed  on the As-treated 
Population. Subjects in the As-treated Popul ation and from the primary cohort will be 
As-treated Population 1 (AT1). Subjects in the As-treated Population and from the safety cohort will be As-treated Population 2 (AT2).
The Per-protocol P opulation will include subjects in the ITT Populatio n who receive the 
correct dose of randomized treatment and who do not have a serious protocol violation. 
Detailed criteria defining this population will be determined and documented prior to performing the primary analysis.
The study will maintain a double-blind setting (ie, blind for subjects, Investigators/site staff, 
and Sponsor/designated clinical research organization) until database lock for the primary and safety analyses. More specifically, at the time of the primary analysis (where the analyses will be based only on the primary cohort), the data from the primary cohort will be unblinded to the Sponsor/designated clinical research organization associated with the analysis, write-up,
and submission. To maintain the double-blind setting for the safety cohort until the safety 
analysis, any data with potential unblinding risk will be split by [CONTACT_469055], no potential unblinded information will be transferred from subjects not in the primary cohort. The unblinded data from the safety cohort will not be transferred to the Sponsor until the database lock for safety analysis occurs. The site personnel, subjects, and the study team 
members involved in advice or d ecisions involving study subjects and/or day-to-day 
interactions with the site will remain blinded until the end of the study (ie, all subjects have 
completed the Day 511 visit) to ensure the trial integrity is maintained. Further details will be 
specified in the unblinding plan prior to unblinding of the primary cohort data.

D5290C00003.
The 70% RRR assumption is based on the Phase 2b Study D5290C00003 in which there was 
70% RRR in the incidence of medically attended RSV LRTI (9.5% placebo, 2.6% MEDI8897; p < 0.001) and RRR in the incidence of RSV hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
(4.1% placebo, 0.8% MEDI8897; p < 0.001) in subjects who received MEDI8897 prophylaxis 
(see Section 1.4.3 ). In addition, the assumption is supported by a placebo-controlled study in 
Native American term infants in which there was a

If the significance of the pooled efficacy based on pooling all subjects from Phase 2b and Phase 3 is demonstrated (at 2-sided 0.05), the secondary efficacy endpoint will be further tested from pooling th e 860 subjects weighing < 5 kg on Day 1 (ie, 
290 subjects randomized to placebo and 570 s ubjects randomized to MEDI8897) in the 
Phase 2b Study D5290C00003 and ITT1 subjects in  the Phase 3 Study D5290C00004. If the 
significance of the pooled efficacy based on pooling the subjects weighing < 5 kg from Phase 2b and Phase 3 ITT1 subjects is again demonstrated (at 2-sided 0.05), the secondary 
efficacy endpoint will be tested using ITT1 subjects from this Phase 3 study alone. With that, the overall Type I error is controlled  at 0.05. Therefore, no further multip licity adjustment is 
necessary.
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary Efficacy Analysis
The primary endpoint is the incidence of medically attended RSV LRTI (inpatient and 
outpatient) through [ADDRESS_601086]

MEDI8897 01Feb2021; Final
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY [ADDRESS_601087] results (performed centrally using RT-PCR) and objective clinical LRTI criteria.
The primary efficacy analysis of the primary endpoint will be performed on ITT1 using a
Poisson regression model with robust variance ( Zou, 2004 ). The model contains the term of 
treatment group and age group at randomization (ie, age ≤3 months, age > 3 to ≤ 6 months, 
age > 6 months) and dichotomous temperate h emispheres (NH and SH) a s covariates. The
RRR, de fined as 1- Relative Risk, and its corresponding 2-sided 95% CI, will be estimated 
from the model. In addition, the 2-sided p-v alue testing null hypothesis that the incidence of 
medically attended RSV LRTI between MEDI8897 and placebo groups are the same will be obtained from the model. Statistical significance will be achieved if the 2-sided p-value is 
≤0.05.
During blinded data review prior to database lo ck for the primary analysis, it was revealed that 
there was no incidence of medically attended RSV LRTI events through [ADDRESS_601088] dose 
for SH in the primary cohort, which would cau se a known convergence or estimation issue. 
Therefore, it was decided to drop the stratification factor hemisphere from the full model and a reduced model (including the term of treatment group and age at randomization stratum as covariate) will be used instead. Similar consideration also applies to other analyses for the primary efficacy endpoint, where hemisphere will be dropped from the corresponding models. 
RSV LRTI that occurs through [ADDRESS_601089] dose, their event status will be imputed assuming the observed placebo 
RSV LRTI rate conditional on stratification factor (age at randomization) using multiple imputation techniques and will be described in the SAP.
If convergence cannot be achieved using the Poisson regression analysis model, the stratified 
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test (detailed in Section [IP_ADDRESS] ) will be used as the primary 
analysis model.
The above described analysis on the primary efficacy endpoint will also be conducted on the 
Per-protocol Population.
[IP_ADDRESS] Additional Analyses of the Primary Endpoint
The additional analyses of the primary endpoint will be conducted on ITT1. To allow for 
differences in follow-up time, the primary analysis using a Poisson Regression with robust 
variance will be repeated, adjusting for the same covariates as well as log (follow-up time) as an offset. Since the follow-up time is adjusted in the model, there is no missing imputation for this analysis.

Zelen’s exact test will be used to test the hom ogeneity of the odds ratios across strata and the 
corresponding p-values will be presented.
In addition, a Kaplan-Meier curve for time to first medically attended RSV LRTI will be
generated based on observed events. Treatmen t group differences  in time-to-first medically 
attended RSV LRTI w ill be compared using the str atified log-rank test with the stratification 
factor (age at randomization) as the strata.
Additional analyses, including summaries for age at onset of the first medically attended RSV 
LRTI, inpatient/outpatient visit settings, a nd RSV subtypes associated with the primary 
endpoint will be provided.
An analysis may also include all RSV positive LRTI endpoints, using results from either the 
central laboratory or local laboratory.
Additional sensitivity analyses will be conducted on ITT1 to assess the robustness of the 
efficacy results with regard to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

estimated using a Poisson regression model with robust variance with the term of tr eatment. A 
forest plot of the RRR and the 95% CI will be presented. In the event that the Poisson regression model does not converge for any stratum of a subgroup, the exact conditional 
method based on the number of RSV LRTIs ( Breslow and Day, 1987 ) will be used as the 
analytical model to generate the RRR and its corresponding CI for all subgroup strata.
The subgroup analysis will be conducted for the following subgroups on ITT1:

(eg, an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom (e g, nausea, chest pain),  or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the 
medicinal product.
The term AE is used to include both serious and non-serious AEs and can include a 
deterioration of a pre-existing medical occurrence.  An AE may occur at any time even if no 
study treatment has been administered.
Elective treatment or surgery or preplanned treatment or surgery (that was scheduled prior to 
the subject being enrolled into the study) for a documented pre-existing condition that did not 
worsen from baseline is not considered an AE (serious or nonserious). An untoward medical 
event occurring during the prescheduled elective procedure or routinely scheduled treatment
should be recorded as an AE or SAE.

5.3.1 Hypersensitivity, Including Anaphylaxis
Administration of polyclonal immunoglobulin preparations and mAbs has been associated with immediate (type I) hypersensitivity (including anaphylaxis) that occurs during or after dosing. An immediate hypersensitivity reaction is defined as an acute onset of an illness with involvement of the skin, mucosal tissue, or both during administration of investigational product (but does not meet the definition of anaphylaxis). Anaphylaxis is a rare event, usually occurring after subsequent exposure to antige n, and it is most commonly accompanied by 
[CONTACT_404494]. It is potentially a fatal, systemic allergic 
reaction that is distinct from simple allergic reactions (eg, rash, pruritus) because of the 
simultaneous involvement of several organ systems ( Sampson et al, 2006 ). A full definition of 
anaphylaxis is provided in Appendix B . See Section 5.5for recording AEs.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 61 of 76 Template [IP_ADDRESS] Immune Complex Disease
Immune complex disease can manifest in the form of a number of conditions such as 
vasculitis, endocarditis, neuritis, glomerul onephritis, serum sickness, and arthralgias. 
Drug-induced immune complex (type III) hypers ensitivity reactions can occur when host 
immune system generates antibodies to drug resulting in soluble circulating antigen-antibody complexes formation and their deposition in blood vessels. Subsequently this initiates tissue 
damaging inflammatory reactions mediated by [CONTACT_316779]/or leukocytes and mast cells. 
The pathology and clinical manifestations are de pendent on the tissues/organs involved, with 
vascular, skin and renal tissues being common sites of injury. Common examples of immune complex hypersensitivity  reactions are serum s ickness (systemic) and Arthus reactions (local). 
The clinical manifestations of serum sickness include skin rash, fever, malaise, and polyarthralgias or polyarthritis. Symptoms typi[INVESTIGATOR_316725] [ADDRESS_601104] exposure 
to antigen and usually resolve in several weeks after withdrawal of the causative agent. Serum 
sickness needs to be differentiated from other ‘serum-sickness-like’ reactions that have a similar clinical presentation (eg, viral infections, anti-seizure drugs), but are believed to have different pathogenic mechanisms. Both serum sic kness and serum sickness-like reactions have 
been reported with mAbs (eg, rituximab, infliximab). Clinical presentation and time to onset should be taken into account for the diagnosis and differentiation of these reactions. Diagnosis of these suspected reactions is best confirmed via biopsy of the affected tissues. See Section 5.5for recording AEs.
5.3.3 Thrombocytopenia
Thrombocytopenia is a disorder in which there is an abnormally low platelet count; a normal 
platelet c ount ranges from 150,000 to 450,000 platelets per μL. The 3 major causes of low 
platelet c ounts include: 1) insufficient platelet synthesis in the bone marrow; 2) increased 
breakdown of platelets in the bloodstream; and 3) increased breakdown of pl atelets in the 
spleen or liver. General symptoms of thrombocytopenia include bleeding in the mouth and gums, bruising, nosebleeds, and petechiae (pi[INVESTIGATOR_316726]/rash). Severe bleeding is the 
major complication, which may occur in the brain or gastrointestinal tract. Drug-induced 
thrombocytopenia is a reversible form of thrombocytopenia that should be suspected in a subject who presents with new onset thrombocytopenia or recurrent epi[INVESTIGATOR_469011], without an obvious alternative etiology. It is commonly induced by [CONTACT_9934]-dependent antibodies that cause platelet destruction or clearance by [CONTACT_451591] (drug-induced immune  thrombocytopenia), and less commonly by 
[CONTACT_9934]-induced bone marrow suppression or autoimmune thrombocytopenia that is initiated by [CONTACT_316781]. The init ial approach to the subject 
with suspected drug-induced thrombocytopenia involves confirming thrombocytopenia, 
establishing a temporal relationship to a drug, and eliminating other causes of thrombocytopenia. The diagnosis is made clinically by [CONTACT_469059] (typi[INVESTIGATOR_16195] 1 week). Most

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 73 of 76 Template 18.0Appendix A Additional Safety Guidance
Further Guidance on the Definition of a Serious Adverse Event (SAE)
Life threatening
‘Life-threatening’ means that the subject was at immediate risk of death from AE as it 
occurred or it is suspected that use or continued use of the product would result in the subject’s death. ‘Life-threatening’ does not mean that had an AE occurred in a more severe form it might have caused death (eg, hepatitis that resolved without hepatic failure).
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_469025] a serious AE, although the reasons for it may be 
(eg, bronchospasm, laryngeal edema). Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2144]/or surgical operations planned 
before or during a study are not considered AEs if the illness or disease existed before the 
subject was enrolled in the study, provided that it did not deteriorate in an unexpected way 
during the study.
Important Medical Event or Medical Intervention
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether a case is serious in 
situations where important medical events may not be immediately life threatening or result in death, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], disability or incapacity bu t may jeopardize the subject or may require 
medical intervention to prevent one or more outcomes listed in the definition of serious. These should usually be considered as serious.
Simply stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_33095]; medical 
judgment must be used.
Examples of such events are:
!Angioedema not severe enough to require intubation but requiring IV hydrocortisone 
treatment
!Hepatotoxicity caused by [CONTACT_76475] (acetaminophen) overdose requiring treatment with 
N-acetylcysteine
!Intensive treatment in an ER or at home for allergic bronchospasm
!Blood dyscra sias (eg, neutropenia or anemia requiring bl ood transfusion) or convulsions 
that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_469026]. The determination of severity s hould be made by [CONTACT_469063] 1 to 5 as defined below.

Grade 4 An event, and/or its immediate sequelae, that is associated with 
an imminent risk of death.
Grade [ADDRESS_601133]. The followi ng factors should be considered when deciding if there is a 
“reasonable possibility” that an AE may have been caused by [CONTACT_7198].
!Time Course. Exposure to suspect investigational product. Has the subject actually 
received the suspect investigational product? Did the AE occur in a reasonable temporal 
relationship to the administration of the suspect investigational product?
!Consistency with known investigational product profile. Was the AE consistent with the 
previous knowledge of the suspect investigational product (pharmacology and toxicology) or products of the same pharmacological class? OR could the AE be anticipated from its 
pharmacological properties? 
!De-challenge experience. Did the AE resolve or improve on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_469027]?
MedImmune Protocol D5290C00004 (MELODY) Amendment 1
MEDI8897 01Feb2021; Final
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 75 of 76 Template 18.0!No alternative cause. The AE cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_230614], other drugs, or other host or environmental factors.
!Re-challenge experience. Did the AE reoccur if the suspected investigational product was 
reintroduced after having been stopped? MedImmune would not normally recommend or 
support a re-challenge.
!Laboratory tests. A specific laboratory investigation (if performed) has confirmed the 
relationship?
In difficult cases, other factors could be considered such as:
!Is this a recognized feature of overdose of the investigational product?
!Is there a known mechanism?
Causality of ‘related’ is made if following a review of the relevant data, there is evidence for a 
‘reasonable possibility’ of a causal relationship for the individual case. The expression ‘reasonable possibility’ of a causal relationship is meant to convey, in general, that there are facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship.
The causality assessment is  performed based on the available data including enough 
information to make an informed judgment. With limited or insufficient information in the 
case, it is likely that the event(s) will be assessed as ‘not related’.
Causal relationship in cases where the diseas e under study has deteriorated due to lack of 
effect should be classified as no reasonable possibility.
Relationship to Protocol Procedures
The investigator is also required to provide an assessment of relationship of SAEs to protocol 
procedures on the SAE Report Form. This includes non-TESAEs (ie, SAEs that occur prior to the administration of investigational product) as well as TESAEs. A protocol-related SAE may occur as a result of a procedure or intervention required during the study (eg, blood 
collection, washout of an existing medication). Th e following guidelines should be used by 
[CONTACT_95108]:
Protocol related: The event occurred due to a procedure/intervention that was described 
in the protocol for which there is no alternative etiology present in the subject’s medical record.
Not protocol related: The event is related to  an etiology other than the procedure/ 
intervention that was described in the protocol (the alternative etiology must be documented in the study subject’s medical record).

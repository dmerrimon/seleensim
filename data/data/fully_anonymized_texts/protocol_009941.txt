Version V1.0  3 Introduction  
This document is a protocol for a human research study. This study is to be conducted 
according to US  (21 CFR Part 812)  and international standards of Good Clinical 
Practice (International  Conference on Harmonization ICH -E6, ISO [ZIP_CODE] and other 
applicable government regulations, and Institutional research policies and procedures ).  
3.[ADDRESS_544280] of a 
human life.  The average person sleeps about 3000 hours per year; thus, the 
importance of sleep should not be underestimated.  Adequate quantity and quality of 
sleep is essential to most psychological and physiological processes.  Obstructive sleep 
apnea (OSA) is a common and serious condition that impairs sleep and can 
compromise an individual’s health.      
OSA can be characterized by a periodic full closure or partial obstr uction in the upper 
airway due to neurological and/or anatomical features factors including micro-  and 
retrognathia and impaired neuromodulation to the upper airway.  Risk factors also 
include obesity, male, or post -menopausal females, age, neck size, and upper airway 
malformations such as deviated septum (Epstein, et al., 2009; Kapur, 2010).  The 
obstruction or upper airways resistance results in cyclical reductions in blood oxygen, 
increased work  of breathing, and arousals (cortical and sympathetic) from sleep.  These 
sequelae may in turn have short - or long -term results such as insulin resistance, type 
two diabetes, stroke, incident coronary heart disease in men, neurocognitive deficits, 
and hypertension.  Along with damage to health, these conditions  may and also have 
significant negative  workplace and economic consequences (Gottlieb et al., 2010; 
Marin, et al., 2005; Redeker &  McEnany, 2011; Redline et al., 2010; Rosekind, et al., 
2010; Yaggi;, 2005).  
Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the most often frequently prescribed 
therapy for OSA.  CPAP provides a pneumatic splint to the upper airway, thus 
preventing closure due to critical closing pressure.  Other therapeutic options include 
oral appliances, surgical procedures, and, most recently, expi[INVESTIGATOR_430290] (EPAP) devices (Provent K071560; K080983; K090398; K102404, Theravent, 
San Jose).   
While CPAP is considered the therapy of choice, adherence to short -term (acclim ation) 
and long -term therapy remains problematic (Somers, Peterson, Sharma &  Yaramchuc, 
2011).  Rates of adherence, defined as usage of at least 4 hours for 70 percent of the 
nights, are reported to average between 30% and 60%; one study found that 31% of 
their population did not fill their prescription for CPAP (Sin, Mayer, Man &  Pawluk, 2002; 
Wolkove, Baltzan, Kamel, Dabrusin & Palayew, 2008).  Thus there is still an opportunity 
to improve therapeutic targets for patients with OSA.  
Expi[INVESTIGATOR_430291] (EPAP) is such a therapeutic target.  Data support 
the use of the EPAP for the treatment of OSA.  At least two potential mechanisms of 
action have been suggested. One of these is increased functional residual capacity, 
InnoM ed Healthscience 
INN-C003 
Confidential  
 
Page [ADDRESS_544281]/pharyngeal collapse. An alternative mechanism is passive dilation of the airway, 
which reduces flow limitation (Braga, Chen, Burschtin, Rapoport  & Ayappa, 2011; 
Colrain, Brooks &  Black, 2008; Heinzer et al., 2008; Owens et al., 2012; Rosenthal, 
Massie, Dolan, Loomas, Kram & Hart, 2009; Walsh et al., 2011).   
The Provent device provides for an “unimpeded flow of air during inhalation, but closes 
so that exhalation occurs against a fixed orifice”  thus creating EPAP  (Rosenthal, et al, 
2009).  The Provent device is comprised of two nasal inserts which are affixed to the 
nares via adhesive, each containing an actuated valve. Several studies provide the 
long-term (up to 12 months) effect iveness of Provent versus sham devices in 
multicenter trial with up to 250 subjects enrolled.  These studies demonstrated an 
effective therapeutic approach in reducing the apnea hypopnea values (Berry et al ., 
2010;Kryger, et al ., 2011).  These studies furt her demonstrated that no serious adverse 
events occurred over the span of the study.  
The BONGO NASAL  EPAP device was developed to provide similar principals of 
operation and is  posited to be substantially equivalent  to the Provent device. This 
mechanism provides for m inimal inhale resistance and controlled exhale resistance 
which increases  expi[INVESTIGATOR_430292].  
The Bongo differs from the Provent in that it is reusable, does not use adhesive, and 
seals against the openin g of the nares instead of the outer edges of the nares and nose.  
During product development, bench testing was conducted on the Bongo, including age 
testing, environmental testing (high temperature, low temperature, and humidity ), cycle 
testing, drop testing, and cleaning testing. Comparative testing against the Provent 
device was  also conducted including inhale resistance testing and exhalation flow rate 
testing.  
3.[ADDRESS_544282] Description  
The BONGO NASAL EPAP device consists of two nasal inserts (a connected pair), 
each containing an actuated valve, with a  patient attachment mechanism.  The device 
works by [CONTACT_430302],  but is closed by [CONTACT_430303] a fixed 
orifice.  This mechanism provides increased EPAP upon exhalation . 
The design incorporates elements of the currently marketed Nasal -Aire II (K022465).  
The Nasal -Aire II is a nas al interface that delivers  positive pressure from the CPAP 
machine to the patient.  The materials to be used in the investigational product are 
similar to those  in the currently marketed product.  Like t he Nasal -Aire II , the Bongo will  
seal against the nar es.

The Bongo is made  of silicone and polypropylene.  A total of four ( 4) nasal insert sizes 
(SM, MD, LG, and XL) will be available during this study.  Subjects will fit  the most 
appropriate size for comfort during the first clinic visit .  A total of two ( 2) valves with 
different resistances (R1 and R2) will be available during this study. Each nasal insert 
size will have the capability to use each resistor for a total of 8 variations (e.g. Nasal 
Insert MD will have R1 and R2 options).

Page 12 of 27 
Version V1.0  During this Screening Visit the following will occur:  
• Informed Consent Process 
• Subjects will be asked to bring their CPAP /APAP machines and/or their data card 
for downloading and review.  The following data from the past 30 days will be 
downloaded: pressure setting, average hours of use per night, % of time used, 
and residual AHI.  If the subject has no data on their data card over this time 
period, and/or the subject has been di agnosed and is unable or willing to use 
CPAP, this will be noted on their record.  
• Subjects will fit for the nasal inserts : 
o Subjects will s elect the size of the BONGO  according to Bongo IFU  
o Subjects will be allowed a minimum of 10 minutes of acclimation with the 
valve R1; ensure that subject has some “supi[INVESTIGATOR_050]” time  during the 
acclimation period.  
o Subjects will be asked on a scale of 1- 10 where their tolerability level of 
the device resides (<5, not qualified; ≥5, will qualify to move ahead) .  
• Once a subject is deemed eligible to participate, b aseline measurements 
including BMI, vital signs, medications, and the above measures  will be recorded.   
6.2 PSG Studies  
Two in -lab PSG studies will be performed  while using the Bongo device. PSG 1 will be 
performed on a separate visit after  the Screening Visit. PSG 2 will be performed after a 
two week (14 day) period of at home use with the Bongo.  
 
Sites will follow the standard sleep protocol methods that include patient preparation 
procedures, the standard r ecording montage, the proper instrument calibration and bio-
calibration procedures that must precede the initiation o f the collection of the PSGs 
according to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) Manual for Scoring 
Sleep and Associated Events (2007), a standard PSG montage, recording channel 
labels and the order to be used will be:  
• left electrooculogram  (E1/M2)

Prior to each PSG, the site will screen the subject for acute alcohol intoxication by 
[CONTACT_19201] a breath alc ohol test or equivalent. If testing shows any evidence of recent 
alcohol use, then the subject will be sent home after being counseled to refrain from 
alcohol use and return to the site within one week for the PSG.  Subjects will be allowed 
no more than two attempts to participate if they are intoxicated upon arrival to the sleep 
clinic .  
In addition, prior to each PSG, the site will call the subject to remind them of the 
upcoming PSG, they will be asked if they have any current cold or nasal condition which 
would prevent them from attending. At the time of the PSG, the research staff will 
assess the subject for  nasal infection, nasal congestion,  or nasal allergies  that may 
impact the ability of the subject to breathe through the nose. If observation shows any 
evidence of nasal infection, nasal congestion, or nasal  allergies, then the subject will be 
sent home and asked to return to the  site after the symptoms have resolved.  
A standard type pre (PM) sleep questionnaire will also be completed at a PSG visit . This 
questionnaire will assess the subjects day of test activity . 
To record data during a PSG with the Bongo, a sampling tube connec ting the nasal 
insert to the pressure transducer is used.  Each nasal insert has a sampling  port for 
connecting a sampling tube.   The sample tubes  and instructions for use will be supplied 
by [CONTACT_430304].  
 
During  PSG 1:  
1. Subjects may sleep in the position that is the most comfortable for them . 
2. All subjects will begin with the R1 valve in place.   
3. Subjects will sleep with the R1 valve  until the completion of one REM cycle. 
Calculate the AHI at this time.  
a. If the AHI is  below 10 (AHI < 10), maintain the R1 valve . 
b. If the AHI equals or exceeds 10 (AHI ≥ 10), change to the R2 valve  for the 
remainder of PSG 1.  
4. Continue to calculate the running AHI of subjects that remained on the R1.  
a. If the running AHI equals or exceeds 10 (AHI ≥  10), change to the R2  
valve  for the remainder of PSG [ADDRESS_544286] leaving the facility:  
a. Calculate and r ecord the AHI for the overall  time the R1 valve was used.  
b. If applicable, also calculate and record the AHI for the overall  time the R2 
valve was used. ( Note that the AHI for R1 and R2 should not be 
combined) .

AASM 3% and/or arousal criteria.  
 
1. Compare R1 AHI , as well as the R2 AHI (if app licable) , to the subject's  baseline AHI 
(from their diagnostic study).  
2. If the subject while using the Bongo had an AHI reduction to less than 10 (AHI < 10) 
or an AHI reduction by [CONTACT_2669] 50% (AHI reduction ≥ 50%) compared to  the baseline, 
then the subject qualifies for the at home portion of the study.  
a. Send the subject home with either the R1 or R2 valve only, whichever  valve 
the subject had the lowest AHI with.  
3. If the subject did not have the AHI reductions described above with either valve, then 
that subject will be terminated from the remainder of the study . 
 
Subjects that qualif y for the at home portion of the study will continue using the Bongo 
at home for two weeks . Subjects will complete a daily use log while using the Bongo at 
home.  
Enrollment will continue until such time a total of up to [ADDRESS_544289] completed all 
components of the study.  
In preparation for the home use portion of the study, t he site will: 
• Remove the sampling tubes from the Bongo and cover the Bongo sampling por ts 
with caps provided by [CONTACT_430305]  
• Subjects will be provided with the instructions for use.  
• Instruct the subject to call the si te if any adverse events are experienced.  
After two weeks  (14 days)  of at home use with the Bongo, the subjects will return with 
their Bongo unit  and daily use log to the site for PSG 2 . PSG 2 should be conducted no 
later than three days  (14+3 days ) after the end of the at home use portion of the study.  
 
During  PSG 2 :  
1. All subjects will use  either the R1 or the R2 valve (the same device) that they 
have been using during the at home use period for the entirety  of PSG 2.  
2. Subjects may sleep in the position that is the most comfortable for them.  
3. Calculate and record the AHI for the overall  time.  
 
Score using the AASM 3% and/or arousal criteria. PSG [ADDRESS_544290] the skin/nares and query the subject as to 
any adverse events they may have encountered and to complete the study.  This visit 
may be conducted on the morning after the completion of their  final PSG or via a 
separate clinic visit .

8 Statistical Plan  
The primary aim of this study is to assess objective sleep parameters while sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_430294] (Test product).  The primary endpoint to be 
evaluated is AHI  compared to baseline data. Baseline demographic will  be summarized 
and reported. For continuous variables such as weight, the mean, standard deviation 
and range will be presented. For categorical variables such as gender, the proportion of 
subjects in each category will be presented.   Descriptive statistics  for sleep study data 
will be reported.  
8.1 Sample Size  
Up to 20 subjects may be enrolled in the study  with a targeted number up to 10 subjects 
who complete the study  and are deemed evaluable. A study with 10 subjects was 
proposed and accepted by [CONTACT_430307] a  pre-

should be regarded as adverse events.  Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are 
considered to be adverse events if the abnormality:  
• results in study withdrawal  
• is associated with a serious adverse Product  effect  
• is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
• leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
• is considered by [CONTACT_430310]-C003

Page [ADDRESS_544293] chart.  Any and all clearly study 
related signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic procedures results should be 
recorded in the source document ; however, events related to each other should be 
grouped under one diagnosis.  
 
All adverse Product  effects occurring during the study period will be recorded.  The 
clinical course of each event will be followed until resolution or stabilization or until it has 
been determined that the study treatment or participation is not the cause.  Serious 
adverse Product  effects that are still ongoing at the end of the study period will be 
followed to determine the final outcome.  Any serious adverse Product  effects that occur 
after the study period should be recorded and reported promptly (see section 8.3 
below).

12 Receiving, Storage, Dispensing and Return  
12.1 Packaging  
A "fitting kit" consisting of a  full set of BONGO devices with the R1 resistor will be 
available to study staff for sizing  and acclimation purpos es.  The se devices will be 
cleaned according to standard practice for cleaning CPAP masks following the facility 
procedures.  Devices will be cleaned after each subject.   
 
For each subject, BONGO nasal inserts of their selected size with both resistors values 
(R1 and R2) will be provided.  If R2 is needed, the sleep technologist will replace the 
Bongo R1 device with the Bongo R2 device.

(HIPAA).  The Protected Health Information ( PHI) collected during this study is related 
to general health and sleep.  No additional information will be collected regarding the 
subject 's PHI.   
Review of data will be allocated to study personnel on a “need to know” basis.  An 
enrolled subject will be assigned a unique patient ID number. Study personnel will use 
the patient ID number to identify all subject data on case report forms.  
In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, 
by [CONTACT_5151], retains the ability to use all information collected prio r to the revocation of 
subject authorization.  For subjects that have revoked authorization to collect or use 
PHI, attempts should be made to obtain permission to collect at least vital status at the 
end of their scheduled study period.  
13.2 Source Documents  
Source documents may include the following  
• Investigator/Designee Note form  
• Case report forms  
• Data from the CPAP downloads  
• Data from the Polysomnogram  
• Self-completed questionnaires  
13.3 Case Report Forms  
All case report forms (CRF) will be completed in their entir ety (i.e. each field filled out 
and or noted as not applicable). For any errors, standard good clinical practice includes 
the follow ing: Each  error will be crossed out with a single line, dated and initialed by [CONTACT_430314].  Queries by [CONTACT_430315]/or illegible  
13.4 Records Retention  
Records will be kept at the investigational research site for a period of no less than 2 
years.  Data will be kept in a secure and locked environment.  It is accept able to 
maintain records at an off -site facility which can be accessed within a reasonable period 
of time (i.e. [ADDRESS_544297]).

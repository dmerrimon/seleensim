 Comparison of Aerosol Delivery of Infasurf to Usual Care in Spontaneously 
Breathing RDS Patients . 
Executive Summary : 
Rationale: Surfactant replacement therapy can be life saving for newborn infants born with  symptomatic lung  surfactant 
deficiency causing Respi[INVESTIGATOR_39053] (RDS) .  Currently such therapy requires instillation of a liquid 
suspension into the trachea through an  endotracheal tube.  Prolonged endotracheal intubation or repeated re -
intubations have undesirable adverse effects on fragile premature infants.  Instilling surfactant as liquid suspension into 
the lung is associated with adverse events due to interruption of breathing i n patients who  already have respi[INVESTIGATOR_27580].  Effective aerosol delivery of Infasurf to su ch patients could decrease the incidence and length of 
endotracheal intubation and decrease the incidence and severity of adverse events during surfactant administration.   
Design : This prospective, randomized, multicenter , unblinded clinical trial will co mpare “usual care” to aerosolized 
Infasurf.  The study objective is to document that aerosolized Infasurf is superior  to “usual care” and provides for some 
patients effective surfactant therapy with  less need for endotracheal intubation and instillation of a surfactant 
suspension into the airway.  Two cohorts  will be recruited: (a) patients who did not receive surfactant at birth who 
develop RDS in the first hours of life and (b) patients who received ins tillation of surfactant for RDS in the first hour of 
life, were e xtubated, and have continuing  RDS.

1.7 Description   
This is a pi [INVESTIGATOR_60312] a Solary s aerosol 
generator adapted for neonatal use is superior  to “usual care” for non -intubated, spontaneously breathing patients with 
mild RDS.  This alternative method of delivery may benefit some patients by [CONTACT_60354] o f a surfactant suspension.  Patient s who have not received 
surfactant in the first hour of age and patients who received intra tracheal surfactant in the first hour after birth but were 
subsequently extubated will be eligible to participate.  Treatment will  not be masked.   All data will be extracted from the 
medical record for the first [ADDRESS_65335] Drug  & Test Device  
Infasurf ® (calfactant) Intratracheal Suspension for intratracheal use only  is an FDA  approved drug for the prevention and 
treatment of the Respi[INVESTIGATOR_39053] (RDS).  It has no contraindications.  It has no identified toxicity.  
Administration of Infasurf is associated with occasional complica tions of cyanosis, alterations in heart rate and blood 
pressure, airway obstruction and reflux of the surfactant.  Currently , administr ation of Infasurf requires  endotracheal 
intubation for intratracheal instillation.  
The Solarys®  aerosol generator is an FDA approved medical device for delivery of aerosolized drugs to the lungs of 
intubated patients.  The proximal tip of the device has been imbedded in a pacifier shaped adaptation so the Infasurf 
aerosol can be delivered into the oropharynx and not into th e respi[INVESTIGATOR_60313].  
2.[ADDRESS_65336] above the larynx.  No physiologic benefit was observed (the animals were healthy) but a sufficient 
fraction of the Infasurf was inhaled into the lung to predict a positive beneficial effect i n symptomatic individuals.  These 
animal studies have not yet been presented at s cientific meetings or published .  
 
2.3 Potential Risks   
 
Version 1.3  
 3/25/[ADDRESS_65337] by [CONTACT_60355].  Aerosoliz ed Infasurf deposits  only in the lung (the site of its activity) 
or in the stomach.  There are no additional risks from  Infasurf delivered as an aerosol than there are from  Infasurf  when 
instill ed into the lung . 
2.4 Potential Benefits   
Successful administration of Infasurf by [CONTACT_60356].  (1) Endotracheal  
intubation (or endotracheal re -intubation) may  be able to be avoided in some patients , and  (2) the adverse events at 
instillation due to filling the airway with liquid and interrupting breathing may  be diminished or abolished.  
2.5 Justification   
The dose aerosolized will be up to twice the dose currently instilled which is 3 ml/kg body weight ( 105 mg 
phospholipid/kg body weight ).  Liquid Instillation delivers to the interior lung an amount of Infasurf that is  approximately 
twice the amount  of lung surfactant  normally present in healthy newborn animals and [ADDRESS_65338] 10% of the dose of 210 mg/kg body weight aerosolized Infasurf migrates to the deep lung it is 
expected  the patient will become surfactant sufficient.   
Repeat dosing will be administered if a positive effect was observed followed by [CONTACT_60357][INVESTIGATOR_60314].  If a patient does not respond with sufficient benefit to the aerosolized Infasurf the attending physician can 
remove the patient fr om the aerosol trial and administer instilled Infasurf  or other approved surfact ant. 
2.6 Compliance   
The study will be conducted in compliance with Good Clinical Practices.  
2.7 Study Population   
Patients will be recruited who :  
 (a) have  a clinical diagnosis of RDS ,  
 (b) are receiving respi[INVESTIGATOR_1413]:  supplemental oxygen plus (a) nasal continuous positive  airway   
       pressure  (NCPAP) , or high flow nasal cannula  (HFNC) or non -invasive ventilation (NIV)  to assist  
        breathing  
 (c) are not intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation for respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399].  
 
3.  OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSES OF THE TRIAL  
For newborn infants born with a deficiency in lung surfactant because of prematurity or other causes of delayed lung 
maturation lung surfactant replacement therapy is life saving.2,3,4  The objective of this trial is to  demonstrate that there 
is a group of patients who can benefit from  surfactant replacement therapy w ith lower  risk of administration 
complications and less discomfort by [CONTACT_60358], safer administration technique – aerosolization.  
Currently s urfactant replacement therapy requires  instillation of a liquid suspension into the airways.  In order to instill 
into the airways it is necessary  that an endotracheal tube be inserted and the surfactant administered through the 
endotracheal tube.  A singl e dose may not be sufficient therapy and , if repeat dosing is likely or inevitable , a decision has 
to be made to either prolong the time of intubation or to remove the tube and possibly subject the patient to re -
 
Version 1.3

 intubation.  One purpose of this trial is to  determine if aerosolizing Infasurf provides an effective alternative for some 
patients that enable  delivery of surfactant replacement therapy without subjecting them to the pain, discomfort and risk 
of endotrachea l intubation or re -intubation.  
The volume of the liquid instillation of the currently approved surfactants (2.5 to 4.0 mL/kg body weight) is larger than 
the total volume of the airways below the trachea which is 1 ml/kg body weight.  Complications at administration are 
the physiologic consequences  of two processes : (a) liquid obstruction of some airways, and (b) stimulatio n of irritant 
receptors in the lung.  Liquid obstruction can produce transient low blood oxygen and high blood carbo n dioxide, which 
together with neur ally mediated irritant reflexes  result in transient cardiopulmonary dysfunctions : cyanosis, tachycardia, 
bradycardia, hypotension, hypertension, airway obstr uction and reflux of surfactant.   Aerosolized delivery has the 
potential of minimizing both airway ob struction by [CONTACT_60359] .   
Specifically the Objectives of the Trial are :  
(a) Document superiority  of aerosolized of Infasurf to usual care in early  RDS in preventing the need to intubate  
       and instill a liquid surfactant  suspension into the patient.   
(b) Show acute improvement i n respi[INVESTIGATOR_60315].  
(c) Document that aerosolized Infasurf is as safe as “usual care ” for RDS patients.  
 
4. TRIAL  DESIGN   
4.1 Efficacy endpoints    
The primary efficacy endpoint will be the incidence of the requirement for endotracheal intubation and instill ation 
surfactant to “usual care” over 72 hours , the time course for acute RDS.  
Secondary efficacy endpoints will measure other clinical parameters  that are indicative of lung surfactant sufficiency:  
  (a) Incidence of death and/or bronchopulmonary dysplasia (defined as an oxygen requirement to  
        maintain acceptable blood oxygen saturations) at [ADDRESS_65339] . 
 (a) Severity of acute RDS measured by [CONTACT_60360][INVESTIGATOR_60316] [ADDRESS_65340].  
 b) Duration of acute RDS measured by  [CONTACT_60361].  
 c) Protection from acute lung injury as measured by [CONTACT_60362] 72 hours of age or intubation and surfactant  
     instillation.  
4.2 Trial Design   
This will be a prospective, randomized unmasked study comparing Infasurf aerosolization to “usual care .”  There will be 
a 1:[ADDRESS_65341] approximately a 
1:[ADDRESS_65342] the “usual care” group of fragile NICU patients with RDS to 
aerosolization with a  saline placebo when there is only the potential  for complicat ions and none for benefit.  
 
Version 1.3  
 3/25/[ADDRESS_65343]   
Infasurf (calfactant) is an FDA approved surfactant  replacement drug.  Repeated  testing documents that aerosolization 
produces no change in its composition, biophysical or biologic activity.5  Aerosolization utilizes a Solarys disposable 
nebulizer FDA approved for human use in patients on mechanical ventilation.  The device has been modified so that the 
distal end is imbedded in a “pacifier like” modification that insures the tip cannot be obstructed by [CONTACT_60363] s the oral tissues from abrasion by [CONTACT_60364].  The Infasurf is aerosolized into the oropharynx in micro -
droplets of 3 to 100 microns diameter rather  than into the bias flow at the nose .  
4.5 Duration   
Patients are eligible for randomization to  aerosolized Infasurf therapy or “usual care” to [ADDRESS_65344] hour of life;  or to 24 hours of age if  treated with instill ed surfactant at birth ( ≤1 hour 
of age ).  Aerosolized patients may receive up to 3 aerosol treatments.  For the “Usual Care”  there is no “participation” in 
any intervention only extractio n of data from medical record.  
Data will be extracted from the medical record until day [ADDRESS_65345].  
No long  term follow -up is planned for this study .   No long term harm has been identified in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_60317].2, 3, 4 
4.6 Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_60318]:  Aerosolization will require the usual bedside monitoring  by [CONTACT_60365][INVESTIGATOR_60319].  Any patient , who in the judgment of the clinical 
care team , is experiencing an adverse event due to  the aerosolizatio n will have it stopped and not restarted.  Taking 
appropriate remedial steps to resolve an adverse event will be the responsibility of the patient’s  clinical care team .  The 
patient will not receive additional aerosol therapy  if dosing is discontinued due to an adverse event . 
Sites .  Following an adverse event resulting in discontinuation of aerosol therapy , recruitment by t hat site will 
automatically be suspended . 
The Principal Investigator (or a co -investigator) will notify th e sponsor within 24 hours of the adverse event.   The 
Sponsor will notify the Study Chair and the Chair of the Data Monitoring and Safety Committee (DMSC)  within 24 hour s 
of receiving notification.   
The site will not re -start recruiting to the study until the site P.I., the Study Chair and the Sponsor  decide that 
appropriate remediation, if necessary, has been achieved.   
Any adverse event during aerosolization will be reviewed by [CONTACT_60366] 24 hours of 
occurrence.  S(he) shall contact [CONTACT_60367] P.I. and after that review either  allow the study to 
continue recruiting or suspend the study.  In either case the local IRB and the Medical Director of the Sponsor will be 
notified with in [ADDRESS_65346] all approved the decision  to restart the trial at that site.    
In addition, if the study is suspended at any one site the Sponsor will notify the P.I. at all oth er participating sites and the 
national and all local IRB s.  Any local IRB, site P.I. or the Sponsor can suspend the study at any or all of th e other 
participating sites.  If  suspended at other sites restarting will require prior approval by [CONTACT_60368] P.I. and the 
Sponsor.  
Entire Trial:  The Study Chairman, the DSMB  chair and the Sponsor will confer  upon receiving notification of any adverse 
event resulting in discontinuation of aerosol therapy with [ADDRESS_65347] served by [CONTACT_60369].  
 
Version 1.3  
 3/25/2020  
 Within 5 days the Principal In vestigator of the site where the adverse event occurred will submit a full description of the 
adverse event along with relevant data from the patient’s medical record.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_60320].    
Upon receipt of report from the site PI [INVESTIGATOR_60321] P.I.  T he Study Chair and the Chair of the DMSC will hold a teleconference to reach a consensus to advise the 
Sponsor to :  
(a) Stop  the trial for the safety of patients.  
(b) Suspend the trial until the cause of the adverse event is identified and remedied.  
(c) Suspend the trial at the site of the adverse event only until a cause is remedied.  
(d) Restart the trial at the site and conti nue the trial at the other sites.  
4.7 Infasurf + Solarys  Accounting   
Infasurf  used in this trial will be identical to current FDA approved Infasurf but provided  in a larger vial.  Storage  of the 
product  will require refrigeration but not masking of product  identity. The vial s will have a label that allows the study 
number of the patient (determined by [CONTACT_60370]) and the data of administration to be entered  at 
use.   
The Solarys aerosolization device modified for delivery to non -intubated premature infants will be provided packaged 
with the Infasurf.  Each unit will have a label on it packaging with a unique ID number and a space for entering the date 
and patient ID number when used .  
Used vials and devices will be retained after administra tion by [CONTACT_60371].  Unused vial -
device units will be returned to the Sponsor at the end of the trial.  Reconciliation of vial-device units  will be done by [CONTACT_429].  
4.[ADDRESS_65348].  At the time of administration an entry will be made into the progress 
notes of all patients who received aerosol that includes the information required to complete the form in Appendix A.  
This protocol requires no study specific evaluation, testing or monitoring of the patients.

6.  TREATMENT OF SUBJECTS  
6.1 Aerosolization of Infasurf   
The aerosol is generated using a Solarys® Aerosol Delivery system adapted for  premature newborns.  The distal tip of a 
catheter is fixed to a proprietary adapter for premature and term infants with RDS.  The adapter has a shape similar to a 
neonatal pacifier . The nipple tip is actually an inverted dome that prevents the cannula tip from being obstructed by [CONTACT_60375] .  The distal tip exits just a few 
millimeters from the end of inverted tip of the  “nipple” and delivers the aerosol into oropharynx.  A fine aerosol mist is 
produced at the end of the catheter.   A schematic of  the set -up is in Appendix  C.   
Newborns are obligate nose breathers.  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], non -intubated RDS patients have a ≥3 liter/kg/minute flow of gas 
passing by [CONTACT_60376] a positive pressure.  The baby [CONTACT_60377], and exhales into, that  flow.   Newborn babies 
with RDS have tachypnea, ~ 60 breaths/minute, and have low tidal volumes, ~ 5 mL/ kg/ breath. Less than 10% of the 
nasally delivered respi[INVESTIGATOR_60322].  The aerosol is generated in the oropharynx so when the baby [CONTACT_60378].  When the baby [CONTACT_60379], some of the aerosol is exhaled, but some remains in the lungs 
and supplements  the surfactant already there.  
 
Version 1.3  
 3/25/2020  
 The Solarys aerosol works by [CONTACT_60380] a small central  tube in the Solarys system at 
a rate of approximately 0.1 9 ml/minute.   Simultaneously an air -oxygen mixture (set by [CONTACT_60381]’s respi[INVESTIGATOR_60323]) is 
propelled down 5 tiny tubules surrounding the li quid filled tube at a rate of ~ 0.9 liter/minute.  As the liquid exits the 
distal end of the central tube the gas exiting from the surrounding tubule s generates the aerosol mist.  
Dose:   A dose equal to twice the current instilled dose 210 mg/kg body weight (6 ml/kg body weight) will be aerosolized.   
That will r equire approximately 32  minutes/kg body weight.  Lung deposition of aerosol is small, usually less than 25% of 
the dose so even an aerosol of 6 ml/kg body weight will result in a much lower lung delivered dose than the current 
practice of in stillation of 1 05 mg/kg/dose.  
Re-dosing:   Up to [ADDRESS_65350] dose.  The indication for re -
dosing will be:  
1) a positive response to the previous dose, defined as improvement in respi[INVESTIGATOR_60324], and  
2) a subsequent deterioration in respi[INVESTIGATOR_4806], and  
3) no adverse event during the initial dose.  
Usual Care:   There will be no protocol driven interventions in the usual care group.  Use of pacifiers as tolerated in these 
patients is encouraged to decr ease the incidence of loss of continuous airw ay pressure through the mouth.  
Sham therapy has not been included because it cannot produce an effective masking of treatment assignment to care 
givers because of both the presence of residual Infasurf in the mo uth and stomach and there is a reliable decrease in 
inspi[INVESTIGATOR_60325].  
Separation of the effect of additional gas infusion derived from aerosolized Infasurf effect by [CONTACT_60382].  Pres sure in the airway is set by [CONTACT_60383], if necessary, to 
maintain the airway pressure ordered by [CONTACT_60384].  The tidal volume of spontaneous breathing 
participants is affected only by [CONTACT_60385].  Usual care patients will have the 
positive airway pressure set and adjusted as their respi[INVESTIGATOR_60326].  
The decision not include a sham procedure was also based on the concern of  interrupting and/or modifying ongoing 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_60327].  Such an intervention has no reasonable 
expectation of benefit for the subject but does have some potential for adverse consequences.   There will  be no 
protocol driven interventions in the usual care group.

ONY, Inc., or its designee , will be responsible for (a) data management, (b) reviewing  and validating all information in the 
clinical report forms, (c) statistical analysis, and (d) generation of the clinical study report.  A Statistical Analysis Pla n 
(SAP) providing details of statistical analyses performed after completion of the study will be  developed.  Prior to locking 
the database, all data editing will be completed and decisions regarding the evaluability of subject data for inclusion in 
statistical analyses will be made. The rationale for excluding any data from statistical analyses will be prospectively 
defined, and classification of all or part of a subject's data as non -evaluable will be documented before the database is 
locked and the statistical analysis is begun.  ONY, Inc., or designee will perform the statistical analysis of the da ta derived 
from this study.  All analyses will be carried out using SAS version 9.4 (or higher) statistical software (Cary, NC).   
Statistical design :  This study is a randomized, multiple -center clinical trial designed to assess the superiority  of the 
experimental intervention (aerosolized Infasurf) relative to active control (“usual care”) with regards to  the incidence of 
intubation and instillation of liquid surfactant suspension .  A total of up to [ADDRESS_65352] hour of life (“the post -instilled cohort”) and up to [ADDRESS_65353] hours of life  (“the uninstalled cohort”) will be enrolled.   Treatment 
assessment will be done for each cohort separately, that is, this study may be thought of as two individual trials under 
one protocol.    
Stratification : The randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_60388] . 
Randomization : Subjects will be randomized to the intervention or active control arm in a 1:1 fashion using a stratified 
permuted block randomization scheme  with variable block sizes of 2 and 4 .  Randomization lists will be generated  by [CONTACT_60389] -based system to be used at the individual study sites .  
Subjects will be included in primary data analyses according to their randomized assignment irrespective of the 
treatment ac tually received (intent -to-treat).  Exceptions would include those who withdraw their consent to use any of 
their data prior to subject evaluation.   
Accrua l. Subjects will be accrued to the study on a first -come basis.  The projected accrual is approximat ely [ADDRESS_65354]. A one-sided nominal significance level of 5% will be utilized.    Additional analyses will be performed 
utilizing both cohorts of subjects in order to assess differential treatment effects.  
Primary safety analyses .  All adverse events will be recorded during the study period and then tabulated at the end of 
the study.   
 
Version 1.3

 Secondary analyses .  Secondary efficacy outcomes representing measures of severity of RDS (oxygen supplementation 
and respi[INVESTIGATOR_60333] [ADDRESS_65355]) will be summarized  using standard descriptive statistics and compared between treatment groups using the 
stratified Wilcoxon rank sum test.  In the case of outcomes measuring the duration of acute RDS (duration of 
supplemental oxygen), so to accommodate the potential censor ing involved, distributional estimates will be based on 
the Kaplan -Meier method and groups differences statistically assessed using the stratified log -rank test.  For the 
comparison of measures of protection from acute lung injury (incidence of lung air le aks or pulmonary hemorrhage from 
randomization to 72 hours or intubation and surfactant instillation), the Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test will be used.  All 
statistical tests will be one-sided and tested at a  5% nominal significance level.  
Interim analysis .  A group sequential approach will be utilized in the statistical evaluation of data, with a two interim 
analys es and the final analysis planned.  The interim analys es, which will assist in making the decision of whether or not 
to stop the trial early for futility, will take place after the study outcome variables are observed in approximately the first 
1/3 of evaluable subjects  and after approximately 2/[ADDRESS_65356] of the primary efficacy outcome, that is, we will compute 
the probability of rejecting the primary null hypothesis at the end of study given the data observed thus far.  In the event 
of unfavorable trends in the data, the conditional power of achieving a final conclusion of superiority  will be much less 
than the initial planned power of the study for a given point in the alternative parameter space, thus making conditional 
power a quantitative tool for use in interim decision making.  Monte Carlo simulations based on 10,000 iterations will be 
utilized to compute the conditional power under two difference scenarios: 1) assuming the parameter values utilized for 
sample size derivati on, and 2) assuming the true parameter values are equal to the sample estimates computed from 
the interim data.  Given the uncertainty in the actual values of the parameters, the conditional power associated with 
the second scenario should be viewed as tha t which is most informative in decision making.  Additionally, 95% 
confidence intervals will be obtained and used to assess if the values assumed in the planning of the study are much 
different than those suggested by [CONTACT_26739].  The conditional power for s elected values within the computed confidence 
intervals may be calculated if deemed potentially informative.  Results of interim analyses will be reviewed by [CONTACT_60390].   After the second interim analysis , sample size may be modif ied using the method 
discussed in Gould (1992),[ADDRESS_65357] size of a 20% decrease in intubation rate.     
9.[ADDRESS_65358] for superiority  on the study data at the 
conclusion of the study, done in conjunction with a 5% nominal significance level.  For the sake of simplicity, calculations 
corresponding to the test based on the proposed approach are approximated by [CONTACT_60391] a simple two -sample binomial 
test.  We assume th e intubation probabilit y corresponding to the active control group to be 60%.  This is based on an 
abstract presented at the Pediatric Academic Societies meeting of 2016 in which the incidence of intubation and 
instillation of surfactant among infants with  early RDS requiring 30 - 40% oxygen was 32 of 50, 64%.  A clinical 
meaningful effect in the uninstalled cohort  is defined as a 20% decrease (in percentage points) in the intubation rate 
which equates to a 48% intubation rate .   Calculations show a sample size of 229 per group ( 458 total) in this cohort will 
result in a test procedure which is associated with power of approximately 80. 1%.  In the post -instilled cohort , 200 
subjects will be enrolled.  This will provide approximatel y 80% power is detecting a 30% decrease in the intubation rate 
(60% versus 42%).  
9.3 Criteria for trial t ermination  
There will be no termination of the trial for early efficacy.  Criteria for termination for futility are presented in 9.1 in 
interim analysi s. The data monitoring and safety committee will review the adverse events and will recommend to the 
study chair and the sponsor that the trial be suspended or discontinued for safety.  Since this is a study of an alternative 
 
Version 1.3  
 3/25/2020  
 method of administration of In fasurf which is FDA approved as safe and effective termination for adverse events 
unrelated to administration of the aerosol is not included.  
9.4 Missing data  
The amount and nature of missing data will be characterized and no method of  imputation will be used for missing data.  
A summary of missing data will be provided according to the number of subjects, the time points where the data are 
missing, and clinical center.  For each clinical center, the number and percent of subjects with no missing data will  be 
presented in tabular form.   
9.5 Procedure for revising the  analysis plan  
If the study biostatistician determines the analysis plan is in need of revision after the  study starts, the biostatistician 
and study chairman will discuss the validity and influence  of revision in the evaluation of study data and will then 
determine if the revision can be conducted. The details of any revisions will be described in the clinical study report for 
this protocol.  
 
10. ACCESS TO DATA  
10.1 Study S ites 
Participatin g sites will agree to providing access to the patient medical records of study participants.  They will also agree 
to allowing true copi[INVESTIGATOR_60334]’s medical record that support the data in the case report forms to 
be retained by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_60335].  
10.[ADDRESS_65359] of the participating site and Food and Drug 
Administration reviewers full access to data in the medical records.  
 
11. QUALITY ASSURANCE & QUA LITY CONTROL   
11.1 Quality Control   
All information about interventions in this study will be included in  the patient’s  medical record.  All sites are approved 
Level III Neonatal Intensive Care Units in licensed acute care hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600].  Data in the medical r ecord shall be controlled by 
[CONTACT_60392].   Any data considered spurious by [CONTACT_60393] P.I. who will attest to its accuracy or inaccuracy.  
All principal investigators and  co-investigators will have credentials to practice as direct care providers in the Neonatal 
Intensive Care Units of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600].   
11. Quality Assurance  
Study monitors will extract data from the medical record and enter it into an electronic c ase report  form.  The Case 
report form will have a 200% verification of agreement with the medical record.  Completed and verified case report 
 
Version 1.3  
 3/25/2020  
 forms will be accrued into the study data set which will meet all Good Clinical Practices criteria for integrity, security,  
traceability and privacy.  
 
12.  ETHICS  
12.1 Patient Safety  
Insuring that both the “usual care” group and the aerosolized Infasurf groups have  unfettered access to optimal medical 
care is the major consideration in d evelopment of this protocol.   
For the “usual care” group the only requirement is that the family consents to our accessing its child’s medical record.  
Full confidentiality will be maintained and there should be no downside for participation.  
The aerosolized Infasurf group may benefit if the therapy decreases the incidence of endotracheal intubation and 
instillation of surfactant.  However, all members of that cohort retain full access to surfactant instillation therapy, if 
needed.  To protect the welfare of these patients no study spec ific assessments or tests are mandated by [CONTACT_760].  
Documentation of the patient’s  status in the medical record contains sufficient information to evaluate the efficacy and 
safety of aerosolized Infasurf  
12.2 Consent   
No patient can participate in the  study without the co nsent of parent(s) or guardian.  
 
12.3 Confidentiality  
All participating patients will be assigned a unique study number.  The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_60336] a log matching the patient’s name [CONTACT_60399][INVESTIGATOR_60337].  Also the case report form 
for each subject retained by [CONTACT_60394] P.I. and the Sponsor will have both the subject ’s study Identification number 
and the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_60338].  This is to allow  the Princ ipal Investigator, the Sponsor or FDA to audit the 
study data or expand the data extraction from the patient’s medical record if necessary for e fficacy or safety 
evaluations.  
All study results will be presented as either group results or, if individual res ponses are reported for illustration , 
identified only by [CONTACT_60395].   
 
13. DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]  
13.1 Case report form   
A copy of the case report form is in Appendix B.  It includes demographic data, respi[INVESTIGATOR_60339] 3 days and data from the patient’s chart relevant to efficacy and safety outcomes  to 28 days, death or

 STUDY SCHEMA 
 
Patients will be randomly assigned to a cavernosal nerve electrical stimulation testing 
algorithm of 4 different stimulus patterns in sequence (Table 1) while intercavernosal 
pressure is recorded to detect penile erection. Specifically, a fixed frequency and pulse 
width will be set with amplitude started at 1 mA and increased by 5 mA increments, to a 
maximum of 30 mA or until intracavernosal pressure is observed to persistently rise. 
Upon pressure rise, amplitude will be decreased by 5 mA and then increased by 1 mA 
increments to identify the threshold level. If no pressure changes are appreciated, the 
contralateral neurovascular bundle will be assessed, and if no pressure changes are 
observed here, the procedure will be aborted.

Study Phase Pi[INVESTIGATOR_373806]/Rationale  
 
 
 Erectile dysfunction persists in approximately 80% of men 
[ADDRESS_468094] not provided benefit. Electrical stimulation 
has been demonstrated to benefit neuroregeneration and the 
functional recovery of neuromuscular systems. Therefore, 
electrical stimulation of the cavernosal nerves during 
radical prostatectomy is being investigated for its potential 
development into a treatment aimed at improving recovery 
of erectile function after prostatectomy. This pi[INVESTIGATOR_373807], as defined by [CONTACT_373818], such that future studies of 
sub-threshold stimulation may be pursued.  
Primary Objective  Endpoint for this study is the accrual of 7 patients and 
collection of cavernosal nerve stimulation thresholds for 
induction of penile erection in each.  
Secondary Objective(s) None  
Exploratory Objective(s) None  
Correlative Objective(s) None  
Sample Size 7 men age 18 years or older  
Disease sites/Conditions Prostate cancer being treated with radical prostatectomy. 
Interventions Unilateral cavernosal nerve electrical stimulation, possible 
contralateral cavernosal nerve electrical stimulation, and 
intracavernosal pressure recording.

 1.0 Introduction  
 
1.1 Erectile Dysfunction after Prostatectomy   
 
Erectile dysfunction persists up to 1 year after radical prostatectomy in approximately 
70% to 80% of cases, whether performed with open or robotic surgical approaches 
(O’Neil 2016). Approximately 30 years ago, it was identified that intraoperative 
preservation of the prostatic neurovascular bundles containing the cavernous nerves 
enabled some men to recover and maintain erectile function after surgery (Lepor 1985). 
Prior to this discovery, the surgery essentially had a 100% rate of erectile dysfunction.  
 
Since that time, technologic advances in pelvic surgery, such as robotic surgery, have 
demonstrated a minimal advantage over open surgery in terms of postoperative erectile 
dysfunction rates. Furthermore, there is limited data to suggest current postoperative 
penile rehabilitation therapi[INVESTIGATOR_61346] a marked improvement in erectile function 
recovery after pelvic surgery. One temporal analysis found stable rates of erectile 
dysfunction, at 70% to 90%, from the mid-1990s through the current era (Schauer 2015). 
A contemporary analysis of patient-reported outcomes confirms that 78% to 88% of men 
demonstrate some degree of erectile dysfunction after prostatectomy (O’Neil 2016).  
 
1.2  Cavernosal (Cavernous) Nerve Electrical Stimulation   
 
1.2.1  Preclinical Data: Electrical Stimulation and Nerve Regeneration  
 
Electrical stimulation elsewhere in urology, specifically the sacral and pudendal nerves, 
has been applied with permanently implanted devices, and used successfully to treat 
voiding dysfunction. Laboratory studies have shown that temporary pudendal nerve 
stimulation in animal models of incontinence can improve neuroregeneration by 
[CONTACT_373819], a phenomenon observed in other 
peripheral nerves (Jiang 2013). This beneficial effect of temporary nerve stimulation, and 
the practice of urologic patients treated with nerve stimulators undergoing temporary 
percutaneous test stimulation before implantation, led to our overall hypothesis for a 
long-term series of clinical studies: temporary percutaneous stimulation of the cavernous 
nerves after prostatectomy will improve neuroregeneration, and the subsequent 
postoperative recovery of postoperative erectile function, as defined by a reduced erectile 
dysfunction rate, better quality of erections, shorter time to functional recovery, and 
improved patient satisfaction.  
 
The stimulation assessed in the animal models of pudendal nerve recovery was performed 
with sub-threshold (20 Hz frequency, 0.3 mA amplitude, 100 µs pulse width) parameters, 
w
hich did not result in end-organ activation (anal sphincter contraction). The ideal 
application of electrical stimulation to facilitate recovery of erectile function will 
similarly utilize sub-threshold (i.e. stimulation parameters will not result in an erection) 
parameters. Previous work during intraoperative cavernous nerve mappi[INVESTIGATOR_373808] (20 Hz frequency, 1-10 mA amplitude, 
220µs pulse width) to produce erections (Rehman 1999). H owever, the stimulus 
CASE xxxx    Page 10    Version date: 03.29.2016  
 thresholds at which sub-threshold stimulation became supra-threshold stimulation are 
unknown. 
 
1.2.2 Clinical Data: Cavernosal Nerve Stimulation for Anatomic Localization  
 
The use of electrical stimulation has been applied to prostatectomy for the purpose of 
cavernous nerve localization to facilitate their anatomic preservation. Commercially 
available devices for this purpose have been developed; however, current surgical 
approaches and improved understanding of pelvic anatomy have resulted in 
intraoperative electrical stimulation providing no advantage in preserving the prostatic 
neurovascular bundles and cavernous nerves. The implantation of permanent electrodes 
for stimulating (20 Hz frequency, 5mA - 60 mA amplitude, 260 &#120757;s pulse width) 
the cavernous nerves to produce erections has been investigated, but this has never gone 
beyond initial clinical trials (Burnett 2008).  
 
1.[ADDRESS_468098] 
shown some promise with these, the clinical investigation of such treatments has been 
limited by [CONTACT_373820]. 
These challenges highlight the potential for application of non-biologic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], such as 
electrical stimulation, to augment neuroregeneration. Electrical stimulation, which has 
been demonstrated safe and well tolerated in many other human appi[INVESTIGATOR_373809], has been 
shown to enhance neuroregeneration. As cavernosal nerve electrical stimulation can 
result in penile erection, determining sub-threshold stimulation parameters is necessary 
such that men can undergo stimulation after surgery and not develop penile erection with 
an indwelling foley catheter. This will facilitate both their comfort and social acceptance 
of the treatment.  
 
2.0  Objectives 
 
2.1  Primary Objective  
 
To determine the cavernosal nerve electrical stimulation amplitude thresholds at which an 
erection, as indicated by [CONTACT_373821], occurs for

6.1.1 Electrical Stimulation  
 
In addition to a dosing schema, please add a narrative description of the investigational 
agent administration.  
 
Investigational Agent Administration  
 
Subjects will receive stimulation patterns 1 – 4 in a randomized order. Specifically, a 
fixed frequency and pulse width will be set with amplitude started at 1 mA and increased 
by 5 mA increments, to a maximum of 30 mA or until intercavernosal pressure is 
observed to persistently rise. Upon pressure rise, amplitude will be decreased by 5 mA 
and then increased by 1 mA increments to identify the threshold level. 
 
If no response is observed on the cavernosal nerve assessed, the contralateral cavernosal 
nerve will be tested with the same stimulus pattern. If no response is seen on the 
contralateral nerve, the procedure will be aborted.  
 
6.2 Electrical Stimulation Dose Escalation  
 
Dose escalation will proceed within each stimulus pattern according to the following 
scheme. The pulse width and frequency will be fixed. Amplitude started at 1 mA and 
increased by 5 mA increments, to a maximum of 30 mA or until intercavernosal pressure 
is observed to persistently rise. Upon pressure rise, amplitude will be decreased by 5 mA 
and then increased by 1 mA increments to identify the threshold level.  
 
If no response is observed on the cavernosal nerve assessed, the contralateral cavernosal 
nerve will be tested with the same stimulus pattern. If no response is seen on the 
contralateral nerve, the procedure will be aborted.  
CASE xxxx    Page 14    Version date: 03.29.2016  
  
6.3 Definition of Dose-Limiting Toxicity (Applicable for dose escalation studies only) 
 
No dose-limiting toxicities are anticipated in this study. The ranges of electrical 
stimulation that will be tested have been proven safe and effective in prior work on 
intraoperative cavernosal nerve stimulation for anatomic mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  
 
Management and dose modifications are outlined in Section 7. 
 
6.4 General Concomitant Medications and Supportive Care Guidelines 
 
Subjects should receive full supportive care, including transfusions of blood and blood 
products, cytokines, antibiotics, antiemetics, etc. when appropriate. All routine care for 
prostatectomy patients will be provided. There is no contraindication to routine care due 
to participation in this study.  
 
6.5 Criteria for Removal from Study 
 
• Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of intraoperative treatment.  
 
• The investigator considers it, for safety reasons, to be in the best interest of the subject.  
 
• Unacceptable intraoperative adverse events related to the surgical course.  
 
• Subject decision to withdraw from the study (full consent).  
 
• Death during surgery.  
 
• Sponsor reserves the right to temporarily suspend or prematurely discontinue this study. 
 The date and reason for discontinuation must be documented.  
 Every effort should be made to complete the appropriate assessments.

prostatectomy care (approximately 24 hours) during the immediate postoperative 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Subsequently, they will undergo a full postoperative assessment 
(approximately 7 – 21 days) at their initial postoperative visit for foley catheter removal. 
Subsequent reassessment will occur at the second postoperative visit (approximately 2 to 
4 months) assessing cancer control.  
 
The clinical course of each event will be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it 
has been determined that the study treatment or participation is not the cause.  
 
Serious adverse events that are still ongoing at the end of the study period will necessitate 
follow-up to determine the final outcome. Any serious adverse event that occurs after the 
CASE xxxx    Page 15    Version date: 03.29.2016  
 study period and is considered to be possibly related to the study treatment or study 
participation will be recorded and reported immediately. 
 
7.0  Dose Delays/Dose Modifications 
 
Dose delays and dose modifications will not occur as part of this intraoperative study.  
 
8.0 Adverse Events and Potential Risks  
 
The risks of this study are low relative to those of prostatectomy. No adverse events 
related to electrical stimulation are anticipated based upon its transient use 
intraoperatively and experience electrical stimulation in other segments of urology, as 
well as the published literature. The potential adverse events and risks intercavernosal 
needle insertion are mild in severity and are familiar to urologists on account of the use of 
intercavernosal injection therapy and intercavernosal aspi[INVESTIGATOR_373811]. Overall, these adverse events pose a low risk to the patient and are all easily 
treatable with minimal likelihood of requiring a secondary intervention.

8.2 Definitions  
 
8.2.1 Adverse Event   
 
An adverse event  (AE) is any unfavorable or unintended event, physical or 
psychological, associated with a research study, which causes harm or injury to a 
research participant as a result of the participant’s involvement in a research study. The 
event can include abnormal laboratory findings, symptoms, or disease associated with the 
CASE xxxx    Page 16    Version date: 03.29.[ADDRESS_468108] a causal relationship with the 
research, any risk associated with the research, the research intervention, or the research 
assessments.  
 
Adverse events may be the result of the interventions and interactions used in the 
research; the collection of identifiable private information in the research; an underlying 
disease, disorder, or condition of the subject; and/or other circumstances unrelated to the 
research or any underlying disease, disorder, or condition of the subject.  
 
For the purpose of this study the following events would not be considered adverse 
events and would not be recorded in the database: 
• Expected potential complications and outcomes of prostatectomy  
 
8.2.2   Serious Adverse Events  
 
A serious adverse event (SAE)  is any adverse experience occurring at any dose that 
results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Results in death.  
• Is a life-threatening  adverse experience.  The term life-threatening in the 
definition of serious refers to an adverse event in which the subject was at risk 
of death at the time of the event.  It does not refer to an adverse event which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6929] .  Any adverse event leading to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_356636], UNLESS at least one of the 
following expectations is met:  
o The admission results in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8932] 24 hours OR  
o The admission is pre-planned (e.g., elective or scheduled surgery 
arranged prior to the start of the study) OR  
o The admission is not associated with an adverse event (e.g., social 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8933].  
However it should be noted that invasive treatment during any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_356637] “medically important” and as such may be reportable as 
a serious adverse event dependant on clinical judgment.  In addition where local 
regulatory authorities specifically require a more stringent definition, the local 
regulation takes precedent.  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity .  The definition of 
disability is a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal 
life’s functions. 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect .  
• Is an important medical event .  Important medical events that may not result 
death, be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a 
serious adverse experience when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  Examples 
CASE xxxx    Page 17    Version date: 03.29.2016  
 of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood disease or disorders, or 
convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development 
of drug dependency or drug abuse. The development of a new cancer is 
always considered an important medical event. 
 
For the purpose of this study the following events would not be considered serious 
adverse events and would not be recorded in the database: 
• Expected potential complications and outcomes of prostatectomy  
 
8.2.3 Adverse Event Evaluation  
 
The investigator or designee is responsible for ensuring that all adverse events (both 
serious and non-serious) observed by [CONTACT_373823]’s 
medical records. Source documentation must be available to support all adverse events.  
 
A laboratory test abnormality considered clinically relevant and requiring treatment or 
causing apparent clinical manifestations related to the electrical stimulation or 
intracavernosal pressure recording should be reported as an adverse event. Those related 
to expected potential complications and outcomes of prostatectomy will not be.  
 
The investigator or sub-investigator (treating physician if applicable) will provide the 
following for all adverse events (both serious and non-serious): 
• Event term (as per CTCAE) 
• Description of the event 
• Date of onset and resolution 
• Expectedness of the toxicity 
• Grade of toxicity  
• Attribution of relatedness to the investigational agent (as determined by 
[CONTACT_373824]-investigators)  
• Action taken as a result of the event 
• Outcome of event 
 
Descriptions and grading scales  found in the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE) will be utilized for AE reporting.  
 
An expected adverse event  is an event previously known or anticipated to result from 
participation in the research study or any underlying disease, disorder, or condition of the 
subject. The event is usually listed in the Investigator Brochure, consent form or research 
protocol.  
 
An unexpected adverse event is an adverse event not previously known or anticipated to 
result from the research study or any underlying disease, disorder, or condition of the 
subject.  
 
CASE xxxx    Page 18    Version date: 03.29.2016  
 Attribution  is the relationship between an adverse event or serious adverse event and the 
study drug.  Attribution will be assigned as follows: 
 
• Definite – The AE is clearly related to the study drug. 
• Probable – The AE is likely related to the study drug. 
• Possible – The AE may be related to the study drug. 
• Unlikely – The AE is doubtfully related to the study drug. 
• Unrelated – The AE is clearly NOT related to the study drug. 
 
Protocol must specify if attribution is required for individual components of the treatment 
regimen or the treatment regimen as a whole.

Only the necessary number of electrodes will be ordered for this study. If a surplus of 
electrodes is noted (for instance due to early study closure) they will be disposed of or 
returned to the manufacturer refund, if possible.  
 
10.0 EXPLORATORY or CORRELATIVE STUDIES 
 
Not applicable for this study.  
 
11.0  STUDY PARAMETERS AND CALENDAR  
 
11.1 Study Parameters 
 
Study parameters include persistent intracavernosal pressure rise to indicate penile 
erection in response to stimulus. This will be documented for each stimulus variable 
tested. Pressure will be recorded  
 
CASE xxxx    Page 21    Version date: 03.29.[ADDRESS_468113]-prostatectomy care, 
as outlined below. Deviations from the following time points are permissible and will not 
require exclusion from the study.  
 
Postoperative Care (0 - 24 hours postoperative): overall assessment, drain removal  
First Postoperative Visit (7 - 21 days postoperative): overall assessment, catheter removal  
Second Postoperative Visit (2 - 4 months postoperative): assessment of cancer control  
 
12.[ADDRESS_468114] in this study will be measured by [CONTACT_373827]. This is 
perfomed via sterile 20-22 guage needle inserted perpendicularly into the right corpora 
cavernosa at the 9 o’clock position, which is connected to sterile arterial line tubing. 
Pressure will be recorded with a standard blood pressure transducer on the anesthesia 
cart.   
 
13.0 DATA REPORTING / REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS  
 
Adverse event lists, guidelines, and instructions for AE reporting can be found in Section 
8.0 (Adverse Events: List and Reporting Requirements). 
 
13.1 Data Reporting  
 
The OnCore™ Database will be utilized, as required by [CONTACT_113297], to provide data collection for both accrual entry and trial data management. 
OnCore™ is a Clinical Trials Management System housed on secure servers maintained 
at Case Western Reserve University. OnCore™. Access to data through OnCore™ is 
restricted by [CONTACT_113298]. Once logged into the OnCore™ system 
with a user ID and password, OnCore™ defines roles for each user which limits access to 
appropriate data. User information and password can be obtained by [CONTACT_113299]™ Administrator at [EMAIL_3337]. 
 
CASE xxxx    Page 22    Version date: 03.29.2016  
 OnCore™ is designed with the capability for study setup, activation, tracking, reporting, 
data monitoring and review, and eligibility verification. This study will utilize electronic 
Case Report Form completion in the OnCore™ database. A calendar of events and 
required forms are available in OnCore™. 
 
13.2 Regulatory Considerations 
 
The study will be conducted in compliance with ICH guidelines and with all applicable 
federal (including 21 CFR parts 56 & 50), state or local laws. 
13.2.[ADDRESS_468115]’s financial responsibility. Subjects must also 
be notified that they are free to discontinue from the study at any time. The subject 
should be given the opportunity to ask questions and be allowed time to consider the 
information provided.  
The original, signed written Informed Consent Form must be kept with the Research 
Chart in conformance with the institution’s standard operating procedures. A copy of the 
signed written Informed Consent Form must be given to the subject. Additionally, 
documentation of the consenting process should be located in the research chart. 
13.2.[ADDRESS_468116] (HIPAA), a 
subject must sign an authorization to release medical information to the sponsor and/or 
allow the sponsor, a regulatory authority, or Institutional Review Board access to 
subject’s medical information that includes all hospi[INVESTIGATOR_44227], 
including subjects’ medical history.  
 
13.2.3  Retention of records 
 
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_356640], records of study drug receipt and 
dispensation, and all IRB correspondence for as long as needed to comply with local, 
national and international regulations. No records will be destroyed until the Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_113282].  
 
13.2.4  Audits and inspections  
 
Authorized representatives of the sponsor, a regulatory authority, an Independent Ethics 
Committee (IEC) or an Institutional Review Board (IRB) may visit the site to perform 
audits or inspections, including source data verification. The purpose of an audit or 
CASE xxxx    Page 23    Version date: 03.29.2016  
 inspection is to systematically and independently examine all study-related activities and 
documents to determine whether these activities were conducted, and data were recorded, 
analysed, and accurately reported according to the protocol, Good Clinical Practice 
(GCP), guidelines of the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH), and any 
applicable regulatory requirements.  For multi-center studies, participating sites must 
inform the sponsor-investigator of pending audits.  
 
14.0  STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_373815]-threshold cavernosal nerve 
electrical stimulation parameters. No statistical comparisons are being made as part of 
this study. Only descriptive statistics of the stimulus parameters will be calculated.  
 
Sample size was determined based upon other pi[INVESTIGATOR_373816]. In one study by [CONTACT_373828], et al (J Urol. 1995, 154: 1426-1428) two differing 
stimulation types were assessed with groups of 6 and 16 men, respectively. Similarly, 
another study by [CONTACT_373829], et al. (BJUI. 1999, 84: 305-310) investigated stimulation in 
groups of men with (N=4) and without (N=10) erectile dysfunction. Our study is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_373817]-ranging sub-threshold neurostimulation parameters and we anticipate a 
sample size of 7 men will provide a sufficient assessment of the range of parameters that 
is clinically relevant. 
 
Anticipated accrual rate is approximately 2 patients per month.

IND# [ADDRESS_405276] (BPCA) mandates the National Institutes of Health 
(NIH) prioritize therapeutic areas in critical need for pediatric labeling, sponsor pediatric clinical 
trials, and submit these data to the [LOCATION_002] Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for 
consideration for labeling changes. This study will be conducted in accordance with Section 409l 
of the Public Health Service Act; as such, the results from this research may be submitted to the 
FDA for review and use in negotiated labeling changes. This research study is contractually 
supported by [CONTACT_22443] (NICHD). The NICHD awarded a contract to Duke University to establish the 
Pediatric Trials Network (PTN) through its Duke Clinical Research Institute (DCRI). The purpose 
of this contract is to facilitate trial design for studies supported by [CONTACT_4289]. A separate contract was 
awarded to The Emmes Company to serve as the BPCA Data Coordinating Center (DCC). 
Infantile hemangiomas (IH) are the most common tumor of childhood. In the [LOCATION_002], 
approximately 80,000 children per year are diagnosed with the tumor, 12-20% of which are 
significantly complex and require referral to specialists for consideration of treatment.  
Complications of hemangiomas include permanent disfigurement, ulceration, bleeding, visual 
impairment, and airway obstruction. Hemangiomas occur exclusively in infants; therefore, 
efficacy, pharmacokinetic (PK), and toxicity data from older children and adults are not available. 
Furthermore, hemangiomas preferentially affect premature and low birth weight infants (<2500 g). 
According to a previous study, every 500 g reduction in birth weight below 2500 g results in a 
25% increased risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a hemangioma.1 
Efficacy of systemic beta-blockers for the treatment of IH has been reported. Historically, 
agents with reported activity in treating IH include corticosteroids, interferon alpha, and vinca 
alkaloids. In 2008, the initial report of oral propranolol use for the treatment of IH was published.2 
This was followed by a number of case series describing its efficacy for IH.3-9 Given propranolol’s 
efficacy and immediate availability in a US suspension, it has rapi[INVESTIGATOR_328192]-line 
therapy for IH.2,10 Furthermore, a multicenter, randomized, double-mask placebo-controlled, 
industry-sponsored trial of a new formulation of oral propranolol has been performed and this 
formulation was approved by [CONTACT_328243].10 In this study, 460 infants 1 to 5 months 
of age were randomized to either placebo or one of four dosing regimens. A rapid response to 
treatment was observed in 88% of infants receiving 3mg/kg/day by [CONTACT_5875] 5.[ADDRESS_405277] proposed multiple mechanisms, 
including pericyte-mediated vasoconstriction, inhibition of vasculogenesis and 
catecholamine-induced angiogenesis, the disruption of hemodynamic force-induced cell survival, 
and the inactivation of the renin-angiotensin system.11 
Pediatric dermatologists are using topi[INVESTIGATOR_328193], safety, or 
pharmacokinetic data . The success of oral propranolol for IH treatment has led many 
practitioners to use topi[INVESTIGATOR_328194]-label for the treatment of IH.12 There are currently no 
commercially available forms of propranolol designed for application to the skin; however, 
intraocular preparations of timolol are commercially available. Similar to the initial reports on oral 
beta blockers, publications on the use of 0.25% or 0.5% timolol maleate gel-forming intraocular 
solutions applied directly to hemangiomas on the skin or mucosa for off-label use in IH are rapi[INVESTIGATOR_328195].

CLIENT CONFIDENTIAL Efficacy of topi[INVESTIGATOR_328196]: Numerous case reports and small studies, 
including those of premature infants, have reported growth arrest and reduction in thickness and 
redness of IH within [ADDRESS_405278] available 
prospective study of 124 Chinese infants with IH, administration of timolol therapy directly to the 
IH for 4 months resulted in controlled growth of IH in 36/101 (36%) infants, and regression of IH 
in 56/101 (56%) infants. Only 3/23 (13%) infants in the control group had regression of IH.18 In a 
retrospective study, investigators treated 73 infants (median age 4.3 months, 25th, 75th percentiles: 
2.6, 7.2 months) for a mean of 3.[ADDRESS_405279] follow-up visit was 45%.19 Previous investigators also conducted a prospective, 
placebo-controlled analysis of topi[INVESTIGATOR_328197] 41 infants, ages 5 to 24 weeks. Among 
those who received treatment, a higher proportion of IH decreased in size as assessed by [CONTACT_328244] >5% at week 20 compared to those who did not receive treatment, 
p<0.02.20 In a study of 25 infants treated for 6 months, timolol was more effective when applied to 
thinner, plaque-type morphology than nodular superficial lesions.17 
Outcome scales used to assess efficacy of treatment for IH: 
Because most of the growth observed in IH 
is in tumor thickness not width, assessment 
of IH progression or regression has proven 
difficult with standard methods of 
measurement. Therefore, investigators have 
developed several scales to assess IH 
growth and efficacy of treatment for IH. All 
available scales are based on a shared 
concept of visual changes (progression or 
regression) at the determined endpoint 
compared to baseline or time zero, and aim 
to convert subjective improvement or 
worsening to quantitative measures. The 
visual analog scale (VAS) methodology is a widely accepted and frequently used measurement 
instrument for assessment of IH growth. When responding to a VAS item, raters specify the level 
of change from time zero to the endpoint (growth or regression) by [CONTACT_124439] a position along a 
continuous line between two end-points. The best results are observed when lesional 
photographs are taken and a centralized assessment is made by [CONTACT_328245], masked, and 
well-trained investigators. Although not formally validated, the VAS methodology has been used 
in several IH studies to evaluate response of IH to treatment with both topi[INVESTIGATOR_328198]. 
Most recently, a centralized VAS methodology was used in a study to gain FDA approval for an 
oral propranolol formulation for treatment of IH. Further, the VAS has demonstrated good 
agreement between masked observers, based on the intraclass correlation coefficient.19,21,[ADDRESS_405280] interreader and intrareader reliability when primary efficacy 
is assessed by [CONTACT_328246].23 
Safety of topi[INVESTIGATOR_328196]: In contrast to oral propranolol for which safety 
data from a completed industry-sponsored trial exists, publications reporting the efficacy of topi[INVESTIGATOR_328199] 1/2/[ADDRESS_405281] been relatively small in size and short in duration, with no pharmacokinetic 
data and little to no prospective safety monitoring; therefore, rare adverse events (AEs) may have 
been missed. 
In a prospective study of 124 infants, parents reported no AEs related to study drug administration, 

NICHD-2015-TIM01 Version 8.0 
IND# [ADDRESS_405282] to the few documented AEs in the above studies, investigators documented epi[INVESTIGATOR_328200] 4 of 22 infants who received Holter monitoring concomitant with timolol therapy for 
IH.24 Two of these infants with clinically significant bradycardia had weights <2500 g at the 
initiation of therapy, both were <40 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA) at drug initiation, and both 
were receiving a timolol dose higher than most of the cohort.24 In a case report of an infant treated 
with ophthalmic timolol and anti-glaucoma medications, the infant developed altered mental 
status, hypotonia, hypothermia, bradycardia, apnea, hypotension, and bronch- obstruction, and 
required intensive care.25 A second case report documented apneic spells in a 2-week-old 
premature infant who was receiving timolol therapy for glaucoma.26 Apneic spells ceased after 
discontinuation of timolol.26 In the randomized trial that supported use of intraocular timolol 
maleate gel-forming solution (GFS) in children with glaucoma, 3 of 72 subjects (4%) developed 
bradycardia or hypotension.27 
Pharmacokinetics of topi[INVESTIGATOR_328196] : Information regarding the PK of 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_328201]. Studies in adults with intraocular application have indicated 
systemic absorption of up to 80% of each drop of 0.5% timolol solution.28 In a limited PK study (5 
pediatric subjects) of intraocular application of 0.5% timolol solution, plasma timolol 
concentrations ranged from 3.5 ng/mL in a 5-year-old to 34 ng/mL in a 3-week-old.[ADDRESS_405283] lower systemic absorption compared to the solution, the 
likelihood of transcutaneous absorption is potentially increased when timolol is applied to the 
highly vascularized or ulcerated tissue of IH, or in the presence of occlusion (e.g., diaper 
hemangiomas).12 Moreover, compromised barrier function of preterm infant skin and smaller 
volume of distribution relative to adults may lead to increased systemic absorption when 
compared to adults.12 Previous investigators measured plasma concentrations of timolol 30 
minutes after applying timolol solution to occluded skin over IH after treatment with fractionated 
CO 2 laser.30 Timolol concentrations were below the limit of detection (20 pg/mL) in all 9 infants. 
An additional small study demonstrated absorption in all patients sampled (average of 
0.18 ng/dL), but the biologic significance of this is unknown.31 
Preliminary data on safety and outcomes of infants treated with topi[INVESTIGATOR_328202]: The 
Hemangioma Investigator Group (HIG) conducted a retrospective, multicenter cohort study of 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_328202] (applied directly to the hemangioma) solution for IH.32 This study included 
738 infants from 9 pediatric dermatology and vascular anomalies centers, thereby [CONTACT_328247]-label use of topi[INVESTIGATOR_328203]. The majority of infants were prescribed timolol in 
the outpatient setting and none of these received prolonged monitoring. During the active growth 
phase (0-3 months of age) 51% of infants showed improvement after 3 months of therapy and 
82% after 6-9 months of therapy. AEs were rare, occurring in 3.4% of infants and there were no 
serious adverse events (SAEs).32 There were no serious cardiovascular adverse events. 
Univariate and multivariate mixed-effects models showed that only initial IH thickness significantly 
predicted early improvement in size (p = 0.0003) and color (p = 0.0001 with IH <1 mm responding

incidence of IH (1-4/100) to that of infantile glaucoma for which timolol is FDA approved 
(1/50,000), 80 times more infants will receive timolol for IH compared to glaucoma, even if only 
10% of infants with IH receive beta blocker therapy. Given the likelihood for increased population 
exposure to topi[INVESTIGATOR_328202], and limited existing data about the efficacy, safety, and PK of different 
timolol formulations, the study of 0.25% and 0.5% topi[INVESTIGATOR_328207] a randomized, masked fashion 
represents an urgent public health need. 
 Potential Risks and Benefits 
 Potential Risks 
 Risks of Blood Drawing 
There are small risks to blood sampling, usually some pain/discomfort with the blood stick and 
blood loss. Every effort will be made to avoid additional (to standard of care) sticks for this study 
and will time clinical blood draws to coincide with timed samples, using existing intravenous lines 
when possible.  
 Risks of topi[INVESTIGATOR_328208]. Application of topi[INVESTIGATOR_328209] (e.g. diaper hemangiomas) may increase transcutaneous 
absorption, and pose a greater risk of adverse events associated with systemic beta-blockers. 
Effects of systemic beta blockade include bronchial hyperreactivity, hypotension, bradycardia, 
hypoglycemia, sleep disturbance, hypothermia, and changes in extremity color or temperature 
e.g., coldness. Infants with known baseline risk factors for bradycardia, hypoglycemia, or 
bronchial hyperreactivity will be excluded from enrollment according to the protocol’s predefined 
NICHD-2015-TIM01 Version 8.0 
IND# [ADDRESS_405288] an improved safety profile 
when compared to oral therapy although transcutaneous absorption has not been fully 
characterized. Conclusions drawn from this study will benefit infants receiving timolol in the future 
through better understanding of the efficacy and the characterization of the safety and PK profile 
of two different formulation strengths of this drug.

CLIENT CONFIDENTIAL 4 STUDY DESIGN 
 Study Design 
This is a prospective, multi-center, double-masked, randomized, efficacy, safety, and PK study. 
Infants who satisfy all eligibility criteria will be randomized (1:1) to 0.25% or 0.5% timolol GFS and 
will be treated for a period of 180 days (Figure 1). 
Randomization will be stratified using two age groups: <4 weeks postnatal age and ≥4 weeks 
postnatal age. Infantile hemangiomas are more common in preterm and low birth weight infants, 
therefore, it is expected that 10% of enrolled subjects will be preterm infants. Infants who are 
eligible for the study based on inclusion and exclusion criteria but whose parents decline 
treatment of the hemangioma will constitute the non-intervention arm of the study and will serve 
as a control group. 
Infants who have progressive disease and require additional therapy as determined by [CONTACT_328250]: if on the 0.25% timolol maleate GFS they will receive open 
label 0.5% timolol GFS two times a day and continue to be followed per the schedule of study 
procedures (Table 6-1). If they are on 0.5% the investigator may choose to continue the 0.5% 
open label or withdraw the participants from the Treatment Phase and proceed into the safety 
follow-up period and receive alternate therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
This study will be conducted in accordance with current U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
regulations and guidelines, (or, as applicable, international regulations and associated 
guidelines), the International Council for Harmonisation Guidelines on Good Clinical Practice 
(which incorporate the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki), as well as all other applicable 
national and local laws and regulations. 
 4.1.[ADDRESS_405289] study identified is a recently completed prospective, single-center, double-masked, 
randomized, placebo-controlled efficacy study in Barcelona, Spain (Efficacy and safety of topi[INVESTIGATOR_328213] 0.5% solution in the treatment of Child Proliferative Hemangioma 
Early Stage Surface. Randomized Controlled Study). This study has enrolled a total of 70 patients, 
35 randomized to 0.5% timolol BID and 35 to placebo BID for 6 months. (EudraCT Number: 
2013-005199-17). In addition, photographs from a second previously published double-masked, 
randomized, placebo-controlled trial (Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry 
Number: ACTRN12610001069044) are anticipated to be provided for analysis.20 These studies 
are anticipated to provide paired clinical photographs of approximately 35 placebo-treated 
patients through up to 180 days following baseline. 
As a secondary strategy, approximately 10 infants who are eligible for this study based on 
inclusion and exclusion criteria, but whose parents decide not to treat the IH, will be enrolled and 
also serve as a part of the untreated control cohort.

CLIENT CONFIDENTIAL infants are withdrawn at any time in the study for reasons other than lack of efficacy after 
randomization, additional infants may be enrolled. All infants receiving ≥[ADDRESS_405294] dose. 
 Randomization Procedures 
Patients meeting eligibility criteria whose parents agree to treatment with timolol will be 
randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 0.25% or 0.50% timolol GFS. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_328253]: <4 weeks postnatal age vs ≥4 weeks postnatal age at time of randomization. 
The infant’s randomized treatment assignment will be obtained through the Advantage eClinicalSM 
enrollment module. In the event that Advantage eClinicalSM is not available at the time of 
randomization, a back-up system specified in the MOP will be used. 
 Reasons for Participant Withdrawal 
 Withdrawal from Treatment Phase (study drug dosing) 
The clinician or family may choose to suspend study drug dosing for any reason during the study 
period, and the infant will remain in the study. 
If at any time during the study, the treating physician determines that the target hemangioma 
failed therapy and the IH requires more aggressive surgical or alternate pharmacologic therapy 
(e.g., oral beta blockers, or oral or topi[INVESTIGATOR_11930]), the infant may be withdrawn from the 
Treatment Phase and move into the [ADDRESS_405295] study dose, and should 
continue to return for planned study visit activities including photography of the IH. 
If a treating physician chooses to withdraw the participant from the Treatment Phase 
(i.e. discontinue timolol maleate GFS dosing), the treating physician must immediately report this 
to the DCRI study PI [INVESTIGATOR_328215]. 
The investigator will withdraw a participant from receiving further study drug if: 
1. Any clinically significant adverse event (AE) is deemed by [CONTACT_1961] [INVESTIGATOR_328216].  
2. The treating physician determines that the target hemangioma 
failed therapy and requires alternate pharmacologic, laser or 
surgical intervention.  
3. Participant develops ulceration of the target hemangioma after therapy is initiated.  
4. Participant receives oral or intravenous corticosteroids or additional oral, 
intraocular, or topi[INVESTIGATOR_328217].  
5. Requested by [CONTACT_18121], FDA, DMC, or PTN.  
 Withdrawal of Consent for Study Participation 
The infant’s parents or legal guardians may withdraw consent voluntarily from participation in the 
study at any time. The infant’s parent or legal guardian is not obligated to state the reason for 
withdrawal. The reasons for withdrawal, or failure to provide a reason, must be documented by 
[CONTACT_328254]/withdrawal section of the electronic case report form (eCRF). 
Following withdrawal of consent, no study procedures or collection of data may occur.

 Randomization of Participants in the Non-intervention Arm 
If at any time during the study the parents of an infant in the non-intervention arm change their 
mind and want timolol maleate GFS therapy, the infant will be randomized for participation in the 
study if there is a need for additional enrolled subjects and the infant meets the inclusion criteria 
and none of the exclusion criteria at the time of first dose.

 Screening/Rescreening 
Infants 0-84 days postnatal age with IH will be screened for eligibility. 
A participant may be rescreened if there is a transient disease status (e.g., parent/guardian 
reports a “cold or fever” and met a temporary delaying enrollment criterion of acute illness or 
fever). No participant may be screened more than twice due to a screening failure result. 
 Enrollment/Baseline 
Research staff will obtain informed consent from the parent/guardian for all participants who 
satisfy eligibility criteria. 
Once the informed consent has been obtained the following information will be recorded in the 
CRF: 
1. Infant demographics, including birth weight and gestational age at birth 
and postnatal age.  
2. Medical history (birth history and cardiac or pulmonary diagnoses)  
3. Physical examination, including weight, height/length, baseline blood 
pressure, heart rate. Note, at the Baseline Visit, blood pressure* and

heart rate and blood pressure at 1 and 2 hours (+/- 15 minutes) after the first application of timolol. 
Data from a minimum of [ADDRESS_405304] be 
collected. Parents of all outpatient infants enrolled in one of the treatment arms will be requested 
to remain in or close to the  clinic for a period of 2 hours after the initial application of timolol.  Vital 
signs (heart rate and blood pressure) will be collected at 1(+/-15 mins) and 2 hours (+/-15 mins) 
after the first application of timolol. The infant will  be monitored for signs and symptoms of an AE 
or AE of special interest during this period, particularly bronchospasm, arrhythmias, and 
hypoglycemia .  
Thereafter, all infants enrolled in one of the treatment arms will have follow-up office visits at day 
30±5 days, 60±5 days, 120±5 days, and 180±5 days and follow-up phone calls at day 
90±5 days,150±5 days. Participants will be monitored by [CONTACT_29382]/caregiver as instructed in

visit), site staff should continue the follow-up period for the full [ADDRESS_405306] no further follow up beyond 
180 days. 
 Efficacy Assessment Using Centralized VAS 
Efficacy will be determined at the end of the study by [CONTACT_328257] (taken by [CONTACT_327021]). All collected images from both arms of 
the study and the untreated control group will be evaluated in a masked fashion by [CONTACT_328258]. Each study site will be given photographic equipment and a minimum of two 
individuals at each site will be trained to capture standardized photographs. Detailed information 
will be in the MOP and the photography vendor’s User’s Manual on how to take the pi[INVESTIGATOR_328221]’s hemangioma in order to obtain a systematic and consistent approach. All study and 
control photographs will undergo a centralized/standardized color calibration by [CONTACT_328259]. Two expert Raters and one Adjudicator 
will be trained on the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), how to recognize change in volume and color, 
and in the comparison of the hemangioma from baseline to study endpoint. However, assessment 
will initially be completed by 2 of the Raters. Adjudication by [CONTACT_328260] a case 
of disagreement between the two Raters (see Rater’s User’s Manual). For the purpose of this 
study, a disagreement will be defined as a difference in both Raters’ assessment concerning the 
treatment response categories on the VAS scale. Raters will use the VAS (see Section 10.1) to 
rate changes in volume and changes in color separately. Raters will be masked to both treatment 
assignment and timing of the digital photograph. Interreader and intrareader reliability of the 
Raters will be assessed prior to evaluation of study infants. The scores of the centralized Raters 
will be used to determine the success or failure of timolol therapy to obtain partial or complete 
regression of hemangioma in each study infant. 
 Laboratory Evaluations 
When clinically indicated, investigators will evaluate infants for the presence of hypoglycemia 
(serum glucose < 60 mg/dL). 
 PK Sampling 
Parents/guardians of infants in the treated groups will have the option to consent for PK blood 
draws, heel sticks, or finger sticks. Refusal to provide consent for the PK portion of the study

remain uncovered unless ulcerated or under the diaper, in which case a bandage will be applied 
when possible. Parents will record daily dosing in a log. Written instructions on how to apply study 
drug on the hemangioma will be provided to the parents at time of randomization and/or first study 
drug dispensing; the study site team (PI [INVESTIGATOR_1461]) will show the parents how to apply the 
correct dose (i.e.,  drop) by [CONTACT_328261]. Detailed instructions will be provided in 
the MOP. At each visit study drug bottles will be weighed to verify compliance. A discrepancy of 
>0.75g (+/-) between the expected bottle weight and the actual bottle weight at Visits 02 and 03

CLIENT CONFIDENTIAL 8 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY 
 Methods and Timing for Assessing, Recording and Analyzing Safety 
Parameters 
Safety will be assessed in all infants following initial study-specific procedure through 7 days 
(+5 days) post last study dose or last study procedure, as applicable, and will be assessed by 
[CONTACT_328262]. Those outpatient infants whose parents are willing 
and able to remain in clinic for a period of [ADDRESS_405311] vital signs (heart rate and blood pressure) collected at 1 hour and 2 hours (+/- 15 mins). The 
infant will be monitored for signs and symptoms of an AE or AE of special interest during this 
period, particularly bronchospasm, arrhythmias, and hypoglycemia. 
Inpatient infants will be monitored by [CONTACT_2360][INVESTIGATOR_33717]. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_328226] (heart rate 
and blood pressure) [ADDRESS_405312] during this period.  
For all treated participants that complete 180 days of treatment on study drug, the follow-up period 
through day 90 (±5 days) after study-specific drug has been completed will include solicitation of 
adverse events of special interest only. Infants whose parents decline treatment with timolol will 
have no further follow up beyond 180 days. Refer to Figure 1 and Table 6-1. A safety monitoring 
committee (DMC) will be convened by [CONTACT_328263]. 
 Adverse Event 
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in humans, whether or not 
considered drug-related, which occurs during the conduct of a clinical trial. (Any change in clinical 
status, routine labs, x-rays, physical examinations, etc.), that is considered clinically significant by 
[CONTACT_65227]. 
Suspected adverse reaction is any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that 
the drug caused the adverse event. A reasonable possibility implies that there is evidence that 
the drug caused the event. 
Adverse reaction is any adverse event caused by [CONTACT_33641]. 
Serious adverse event or serious suspected adverse reaction or serious adverse reaction 
as determined by [CONTACT_328264]: 
1. Death  
2. Life-threatening AE (“life-threatening” means that the study participant was, in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_26335], at immediate risk of death from the reaction 
as it occurred and required immediate intervention)  
3. Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions  
4. Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
5. Important medical event that may not result in one of the above outcomes, but may 
jeopardize the health of the study participant or require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the above definition of serious 
event  
 Adverse Events of Special Interest 
In addition, we will specifically evaluate infants for the following adverse events of special interest: 
NICHD-2015-TIM01 Version 8.0 
IND# 129154 19NOV2021

CLIENT CONFIDENTIAL 1. Bradycardia (need for pharmacologic intervention, or a persistent heart rate below 
100 while awake and alert after drug administration) (per study clinician or per 
parent report if informed by [CONTACT_213989])  
2. Hypotension (need for pharmacologic intervention, or blood pressure < 80% 
standard values for age) (per study clinician or per parent report if informed by 
[CONTACT_213989])  
3. New alteration in mental status (e.g., drowsiness, lethargy) (per study clinician or 
parent report)  
4. New local skin irritation (per study clinician or parent report)  
5. New sleep disturbance (per study clinician or parent report)  
6. Apnea (per study clinician or parent report)  
7. Bronchospasm (evaluated by [CONTACT_328265])  
8. Hypoglycemia (serum glucose < 60 mg/dL) (evaluated by [CONTACT_328266])  
9. Diarrhea (per parent report)  
10. Arrhythmias  
 Unexpected Adverse Event 
This is defined as any adverse event, the specificity or severity of which is not consistent with the 
package insert or investigational plan. 
 Identification of Events and Timeframe for Reporting 
Pre-existing conditions will not be considered as adverse events. New events that occur or 
pre- existing conditions that worsen in terms of frequency or intensity will be reported as adverse 
events. 
All reportable events as defined above, determined to be an AE based on physical examination, 
laboratory findings, or other means, will be reported in the electronic case report form (e-CRF). 
The investigator will provide the date of onset and resolution, intensity, action(s) taken, changes 
in study drug dosing, relationship to study drug, and outcome. 
Any event excluding adverse events of special interest beginning more than [ADDRESS_405313] 
dose of study drug. 
 Follow-up of Adverse Events 
All events (study-related or not) must be followed to adequately evaluate the infant’s safety or 
until the event stabilizes/resolves. Any safety event that is identified at the last assessment (or an 
early termination) must be recorded on the appropriate eCRF with the status of the safety event 
noted. All serious suspected adverse reactions and serious adverse reactions will be followed 
until resolution or until the infant is medically stable. All other events that cannot be resolved by 
[ADDRESS_405314] the status of the 
ongoing event entered in the electronic data capture (EDC) system at that time. 
  Guidelines for Assessing Grade of an Adverse Event 
The investigator should use the following definitions when assessing intensity of an adverse 
event: 
1. MILD: Participant is aware of symptoms or has minor findings but tolerates them 
well, and no or minimal intervention required.  
2. MODERATE: Participant experiences enough symptoms or findings to require

23 
CLIENT CONFIDENTIAL intervention.  
3. SEVERE : Participant experiences symptoms or findings that require significant 
intervention.  
 Guidelines for Determining Causality 
The investigator will use the following question when assessing causality of an adverse event to 
study drug, where an affirmative answer designates the event as a suspected adverse reaction: 
Is there a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the event? ‘‘Reasonable possibility’’ means 
that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event. 
 Discontinuation of a Participant Due to Adverse Events 
Infants may be withdrawn from the study at any time. Infants withdrawn from the study due to an 
AE, whether serious or non-serious, must be followed by [CONTACT_328267]. Any infant who experiences an AE may be withdrawn at any time from 
the study at the discretion of the investigator. The AE(s) should be noted on the appropriate CRFs, 
and the infant’s progress should be followed until the AE is resolved or considered stable. The 
Medical Monitor and the Protocol Chair/PI [INVESTIGATOR_240297]. 
 Reporting Procedures 
Information about AEs will be solicited by [CONTACT_98750]. 
All adverse events will be entered into the safety data system within [ADDRESS_405315] 
also submit safety reports locally as required by [CONTACT_11577]. 
 Regulatory Reporting 
Any event that requires expedited reporting based on federal regulations will be forwarded to the 
IND sponsor. The IND sponsor will submit expedited safety reports (e.g. IND safety reports) to 
the regulatory agencies as necessary, and will inform the investigators of such regulatory reports. 
Site investigators must submit safety reports as required by [CONTACT_11577]. Documentation of the 
submission and receipt by [CONTACT_328268]. 
All serious events irrespective of their designation as “related” or “not related” to study product(s) 
will be reported to the FDA at least annually in a summary format. 
 Safety Oversight 
The DMC will review serious adverse events at regularly scheduled meetings. In addition, a 
qualified and experienced clinician not otherwise associated with this protocol will serve as the 
medical monitor. The medical monitor will review all SAEs at the time they are reported. If safety 
concerns are identified, the medical monitor may request a meeting of the DMC to review safety 
data. At a minimum, the medical monitor will comment on the outcomes of the SAE and causal 
relationship of the SAE to the study product. The medical monitor will also indicate whether he/she 
concurs with the details of the report provided by [CONTACT_1704]. If no SAEs prompt review 
at an earlier time point, the DMC will review AEs and SAEs at the regularly scheduled meeting. 
The DMC will convene and make recommendations on termination of the study based on review

CLIENT CONFIDENTIAL Secondary Endpoints: 
Secondary efficacy endpoints will include the following: 
1. Estimation of the proportion of infants with partial response in hemangioma color 
(partial response or greater as assessed by [CONTACT_8298]-color) from baseline to day 
180 within each randomized treatment arm and compared with the untreated 
controls.  
2. Comparison of partial response of hemangioma volume (partial response or greater 
as assessed by [CONTACT_8298]-volume) between the two treatment arms.  
3. Comparison of partial response of hemangioma color (partial response or greater as 
assessed by [CONTACT_8298]-color) between the two treatment arms.  
4. Absolute change in hemangioma dynamic complication scale from Day [ADDRESS_405317] (Section 8.1.2 ) from randomization to Day 180 in infants treated with topi[INVESTIGATOR_328228] (0.25% and 0.5%) GFS for the treatment of infantile hemangioma. 
Exploratory Endpoints: 
Exploratory PK endpoints include estimation of PK parameters such as clearance (CL), volume 
of distribution (V), area under the curve (AUC), and maximum concentration (Cmax), as possible. 
The relationship between different hemangioma characteristics and plasma concentrations may 
also be described as an exploratory endpoint. 
Treatment Failure for Partial Response in Hemangioma Color or Volume 
The infant will be considered a treatment failure for the primary endpoint of partial response of 
VAS-volume or the secondary endpoint of partial response of VAS-color from baseline to Day 180 
if any of the following conditions are met: 
1. Partial response not achieved at the Day 180 visit in infants who complete the 
180-day treatment period.  
2. Infant withdrawn from masked treatment due to progressive disease. This will 
include participants randomized to the 0.25% treatment arm and switched to the 
0.5% treatment arm.  
3. Ulceration of the target hemangioma after initiation of masked treatment.  
4. Infant withdrawn from study treatment due to safety concerns.  
5. Study drop-out or loss to follow-up after the 30-day visit and before the 180-day visit 
for reasons other than progressive disease, ulceration, or safety concerns without 
having achieved partial response at the last study visit before drop-out.  
Partial response will not be evaluated in participants who drop-out from the study for reasons 
other than progressive disease, ulceration, or safety concerns or are lost to follow-up before the 
30-day visit. Sensitivity analyses will be performed to assess the impact of assumptions made to 
account for drop-out on the primary analysis. This will include summaries of partial response that 
exclude participants who withdrew for reasons other than lack of efficacy. Other methods, such 
as multiple imputation, may be considered based on drop-out rates and cause of missingness.

CLIENT CONFIDENTIAL In addition to the assessments of partial response through the 180-day visit, the proportion of 
participants who achieve partial response through each study visit will be summarized. The 
number of participants with partial response before but not at the 180-day visit will be summarized. 
 Study Hypotheses Tested 
For the primary analyses of treatment efficacy, let p RC be the proportion with partial or greater 
response in hemangioma volume for the control cohort, p R25 the proportion with partial or greater 
response in hemangioma volume for the 0.25% arm, and p R50 the proportion with partial or greater 
response in hemangioma volume for the 0.5% arm. The following set of hypotheses will be 
assessed: 
Hypothesis 1 (H 1): The partial response proportion in the 0.5% arm is greater than the partial 
response proportion in the control cohort. 
Null hypothesis H 10: pR50 ≤ p RC  
Alternative hypothesis H 1A: pR50 > p RC 
Hypothesis 2 (H 2): The partial response proportion in the 0.25% arm is greater than the partial 
response proportion in the control cohort. 
Null hypothesis H 20: pR25 ≤ p RC  
Alternative hypothesis H 2A: pR25 > p RC 
A secondary efficacy hypothesis comparing treatment arms will also be tested: 
Secondary efficacy hypothesis (H 3): The partial response proportion in the 0.25% arm is not equal 
to the partial response proportion in the 0.5% arm. 
Null hypothesis H 30: pR25 = p R50 
Alternative hypothesis H 3A: pR25 ≠ p R50 
The =0.05 level will be used for hypothesis testing. Hypotheses will be tested with chi-square or 
Fisher’s exact tests. A Bonferroni multiplicity correction will be applied to the  level for the primary 
hypotheses. Response proportions will be further compared between groups using the odds ratio 
or estimated differences in proportions and corresponding confidence interval estimates. 
 Sample Size Considerations 
Sample size calculations for primary efficacy hypotheses assume that [ADDRESS_405318] 
evaluable data in the untreated control cohort. The following success rates are assumed: 
0.15 response proportion in the control cohort, 0.45 response proportion in the 0.25% arm, and 
0.50 response proportion in the 0.5% arm. With 45 participants in each treatment arm and  = 
0.05 as in Section 10.2, this gives the efficacy hypothesis comparing the 0.5% and control arms 
a power of 93% and the efficacy hypothesis comparing the 0.25% and control arms a power of 
85% after applying the Bonferroni multiplicity correction to the alpha level. The study sample size 
of 100 randomized participants was determined by [CONTACT_328272] 10% of randomized infants 
will drop out with unevaluable partial response. 
Sample size calculations for the secondary safety analyses assume that approximately 20% of 
participants will experience an AE of special interest and 5% will experience an SAE of special 
interest.24,32 With 100 participants across the two treatment groups, 95% Wilson score confidence 
intervals are (0.02,0.11) (confidence interval width=0.09) for SAEs and (0.13,0.29) (confidence 
interval width=0.16) for AEs. These intervals are thought to be sufficiently precise for the 
estimation of key event rates. The probability is 0.[ADDRESS_405319] one event will be seen

postnatal age, gestational age, sex, and selected clinical variables recorded prior to initiation of 
study drug. Study drug administration will be summarized in terms of number of days of dosing 
and reasons for final discontinuation of study drug. 
 Efficacy Analysis 
Key efficacy endpoints are summarized in Section 10.1. Chi-square or Fisher’s exact tests will be 
used to test response proportion hypotheses at study end. Response proportions will be further 
compared via odds ratio, difference in proportion, and confidence interval estimates. 
Further adjusted analyses taking into account postnatal age, gestational age, and other baseline 
or demographic covariates of interest via logistic regression will be performed. Differences 
between studies used for the control data will be assessed. 
As discussed in Section 10.1, randomized participants who switch to unmasked treatment with 
timolol maleate 0.5% GFS due to disease progression will be classified as treatment failures in 
the primary analysis. VAS scores following the switch to unmasked treatment will be analyzed as 
a secondary analysis. Both the VAS assessment of change from study baseline and change in 
VAS score from the time of treatment switching will be summarized in this secondary analysis. 
The duration of unmasked treatment will be summarized. Partial response of color or volume from 
the start of randomized treatment will be evaluated in participants who switch treatment using 
data collected after the treatment switch. 
Additional secondary efficacy variables for analysis between randomized treatment arms include 
severity of the hemangioma, time to partial response, and quality of life measurement variables. 
Absolute change in overall severity will be measured via hemangioma dynamic complication scale 
from baseline to Day [ADDRESS_405321] will be considered.

CLIENT CONFIDENTIAL 12 INFORMED CONSENT PROCESS 
Informed consent is a process that is initiated prior to the infant’s parent or legal guardian agreeing 
to participate in the study and continuing throughout the infant’s study participation. Extensive 
discussion of risks and possible benefits of participation in this study will be provided with the 
infant’s parent(s) and/or legal guardian (if applicable). Consent forms describing in detail the study 
procedures and risks will be given to the infant’s parent(s)/legal guardian, and documentation of 
informed consent is required prior to enrolling in the study. Consent forms will be IRB-approved, 
and local IRBs will determine whether one or two parent signatures are required based on the 
risk level of study or local regulatory requirements. The infant’s parent(s)/legal guardian will be 
asked to read and review the document. Upon reviewing the document, the investigator will 
explain the research study to the infant’s parent(s)/legal guardian and answer any questions that 
may arise. The infant’s parent(s)/legal guardian will provide informed consent prior to the conduct 
of any study procedures. The infant’s parent(s)/legal guardian should have the opportunity to think 
about the study prior to allowing the infant to participate. The infant’s parent(s)/legal guardian may 
withdraw consent at any time throughout the course of the study. A copy of the executed informed 
consent document will be given to the infant’s parent(s)/legal guardian for their records. The rights 
and welfare of the infants will be protected by [CONTACT_328278](s)/legal guardian that 
the quality of their medical care will not be adversely affected if they decline to allow their infant 
to participate in this study. For non-English speakers, a fully translated consent or an oral 
presentation accompanied by a short form may be used to obtain informed consent. The fully 
translated consent and the short form must be approved by [CONTACT_328279]. 
The IND sponsor or designee will provide the investigator, in writing, any new information that 
bears significantly on the infants’ risk to receive the investigational product. This new information 
will be communicated by [CONTACT_328280]’ parent(s)/legal guardian who have consented 
for their infant to participate in the trial in accordance with IRB requirements. The informed consent 
document will be updated, and infants’ legal guardians will be re-consented, if necessary. 
Site staff may employ IRB-approved recruitment efforts prior to informed consent; however, 
before any protocol-specific procedures are performed to determine protocol eligibility, informed 
consent must be obtained and properly executed. The investigator will choose infants in 
accordance with the eligibility criteria detailed previously. To prevent bias, the investigator will not 
exercise selectivity. 
By [CONTACT_328281], the infant’s parent/legal guardian agrees that the infant will complete all 
evaluations required by [CONTACT_20767], unless the infant’s parent/legal guardian withdraws the infant 
voluntarily or the infant is withdrawn from the trial for any reason.

CLIENT CONFIDENTIAL 13 FUTURE USE OF STUDY DATA AND STORED 
SPECIMENS 
After study-specific testing is complete, information about the study, including study data, will be 
de-identified and submitted to the NIH data repository (https://dash.nichd.nih.gov; referred to 
below as “DASH”) in compliance with NIH policies on data sharing. Other researchers may submit 
requests to DASH to use these data for future, unspecified research. The NICHD DASH Data 
Access Committee reviews all requests to determine whether the proposed use of the data is 
scientifically and ethically appropriate. 
The de-identified photographs that were sent to the external raters and adjudicator will be 
destroyed after all study analyses and the FDA review of the study results are complete. 
PK samples will be labeled at the site with a study-provided barcode label. The barcode will only 
contain a unique code number without protected health information (PHI) or any other information 
that could identify the study participant. These samples will be stored at the site and then shipped 
to a central lab for study-specific PK testing. After analysis, these PK samples will be stored until 
the FDA completes review of the final research study report and proposed drug label changes. 
Once FDA review of the study results is complete, the samples will be destroyed. No other 
biospecimens will be collected or stored in this study.

 1. BACKGROUND AND  RATIONALE  
 
1.1. Disease Background  
Colorectal  cancer  is the second  leading cause  of cancer  mortality  in the United  States (1). Recent  
advances in the treatment of this deadly cancer  have almost  doubled the median  survival  time of those 
patients.  The introduction of Irinotecan  and Oxaliplatin  along with 5FU has enabled patients  to live 
longer  (2-4). Those  drugs represent  the conventional  chemotherapeutic  armamentarium  for treating  
metastatic colorectal  cancer  (MCRC).  More  recently,  added to that armamentarium,  came  targeted  
biologic  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014],  cetuximab,  panitumumab, and bevacizumab  with the potential  to improve  survival  
even further  (5-6). With  these molecularly  targeted  agents,  the survival of patients  with metastatic  
disease is now  approximating 24 months.  
 
1.2. Drug  Background  
 
1.2.1. Panitumumab  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Panitumumab Pharmacology 
Panitumumab  is a high affinity  (Kd = 5 x 10-11 M) fully  human  IgG2  monoclonal  antibody that is 
directed  against the human  EGFR.  This fully  human  antibody was engineered  using XenoMouse®  
technology developed by [CONTACT_763508]. In this proprietary  strain  of mice,  murine  heavy and light chain  
immunoglobulin genes  were  inactivated  and most  of the human heavy and light chain  immunoglobulin  
genes  (both kappa  and lambda) were  inserted.  When  this strain  of engineered  mice  was immunized with 
EGFr  over- expressing  A431 cells,  fully  human anti-EGFr  antibodies  were  produced, from  which  
panitumumab  was selected  for further development. (7)  
Through the high -affinity  interaction  of panitumumab with the active site of the EGFr,  binding of the 
ligands  EGF,  TGFα,  amphiregulin, betacellulin,  epi[INVESTIGATOR_13358], and heparin- EGF  is blocked. This inhibition  
may in turn arrest  tumor cell proliferation,  inhibit metastasis,  and trigger apoptosis (programmed cell 
death). (7) 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Preclinical  Antitumor  Activity  of Panitumumab  
In murine  xenograft  tumor models,  panitumumab  has demonstrated tumor  growth  inhibition, eliciting  
both tumor regression  and eradication  of established  tumors  (8). When  panitumumab was combined 
with chemotherapeutic  agents,  eradication  and inhibition of the growth of human  epi[INVESTIGATOR_015], ovarian,  
breast,  and pancreatic carcinoma  cells in vitro and A431 epi[INVESTIGATOR_015], DU145 prostrate,  and A549 lung 
xenografts  in vivo were  observed. In addition,  the administration  of panitumumab  combined  with a 
multikinase  inhibitor,  AMG 706, in mice  resulted  in significantly  greater  tumor growth inhibition  of 
A431 epi[INVESTIGATOR_015], HT29  colon, and Calu6 non- small  cell lung xenografts  than with  either agent alone. 
The antineoplastic  effects  of panitumumab have been demonstrated in multiple  human  xenograft  tumor  
models. Panitumumab, at a dose of 1.0 mg/injection  administered  intraperitoneally  (IP) twice  weekly  
for 3 weeks,  inhibited  the growth of human  A431  epi[INVESTIGATOR_763480],  resulting  in the complete  regression  of established  (≤ 1.2 cm3)  
tumors.  Lower  doses  of panitumumab administered  twice  weekly  for [ADDRESS_1046282] in different  tumor cell types  (9).   A lack of antitumor

IRB Approved:   10.21.[ADDRESS_1046283] for proliferation,  
survival, and/or  angiogenesis  may be more  important.  The data indicate  that expression  of EGFr  on 
tumors  is frequently accompanied  by [CONTACT_763509]-EGFr  antibodies, such as panitumumab, may lead to growth arrest  and 
regression  (9). 
 
The effects of panitumumab in combination  with chemotherapeutic  agents  (doxorubicin, cisplatin,  and 
docetaxel) have been  evaluated  in in-vivo models  and have indicated  additive  growth inhibition of  tumor  
xenografts. Panitumumab  also has been  evaluated  in combination with AMG  706, a  multikinase  inhibitor 
including VEGF  receptor,  resulted  in significantly  greater  inhibition of tumor xenografts  than either 
agent  alone. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Clinical Studies  with Panitumumab  
The clinical  development  program  for panitumumab is extensive and includes  a wide  range  of studies.  
Fifteen  studies have been  initiated  and over [ADDRESS_1046284] been treated  with panitumumab at 
multiple  dose levels  and 1 of 3 dosing schedules (2.5 mg/kg weekly, 6 mg/kg every 2  weeks or 9 mg/kg  
every  3 weeks).  Subjects with a variety  of solid  tumors  (CRC,  renal  cell, prostate,  NSCLC,  pancreatic,  
esophageal)  have been  treated  with panitumumab  in either  a monotherapy setting or in combination with 
chemotherapy. 
 
Initia
lly in MCRC,  panitumumab, as a single  agent, had been  shown to have antitumor activity  in 
refractory  MCRC in both EGFR -positive  and – negative  tumors  (10,11). However  subsequent  follow  up 
has shown a significant  difference  in response  comparing  patients with mutated  KRAS  oncogene  
compared  to those without a mutation  on this oncogene  (12,43). The patients with patients  a wild-type 
or unmutated KRAS  oncogene  have a significantly  better  response  to monoclonal  antibody targeted  
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_763481].  As such, panitumumab  has been FDA approved for the treatment  of EGFR - 
expressing  mCRC  after progression on or following  fluoropyrimidine -, oxaliplatin -, and irinotecan - 
containing chemotherapy regimens.  
 
In addition, a recen t phase 3, multicenter,  randomized  controlled trial (RCT)  of panitumumab  plus best 
supportive  care (BSC)  vs BSC alone  in patients  (pts) with metastatic  colorectal  cancer  (mCRC).  In this 
study, patients  receiving  panitumumab had a 46% lower  relative  progression  rate than those receiving  
BSC alone  (hazard  ratio=0.54, 95% CI: 0.44, 0.66). By [CONTACT_763510]  (week  8), a higher  
percentage of patients  alive  without  progression was observed in the panitumumab  versus  BSC group  
(49%  versus  30%, respectively); a difference in the percentage  of patients  alive  favoring panitumumab  
continued through week  32 (AACR abs CP-1,12). In combination  with IFL ([COMPANY_010]  Study 20025409), 
the incidence  of grade  3 or 4 diarrhea (58%)  was notably higher than that historically  expected  for this 
already  highly  GI-toxic  chemotherapy regimen,  and [ADDRESS_1046285]  had an epi[INVESTIGATOR_254335]  4 diarrhea that 
was also considered  serious.  Of note, panitumumab in combination with the FOLFIRI  regimen  using the  
same  agents  but different  doses/infusion times  was better  tolerated  with an incidence  of grade  3 or 4 
diarrhea  similar to that expected  from the literature  for this chemotherapy regimen  alone  (25%)  (median  
PFS=10.9  months) (13,14).. These  data suggest  that the potential  for additive  toxicities  in the 
gastrointestinal  tract ex ists when  panitumumab is administered  in combination with GI-toxic  
chemotherapy. However,  these toxicities  could be managed  by [CONTACT_763511] #: 2012C0033

 chemotherapy regimen.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Toxicities  
 
Nonclinical  toxicology studies  were  conducted to support  the use of panitumumab  for intravenous  
administration  in the oncology setting. All toxicology studies  were  conducted in cynomolgus  monkeys,  
the only pharmacologically  relevant  nonhuman species.  Panitumumab  was administered  IV at doses  
ranging from 0.3 to 30 mg/kg  once weekly  for 4 weeks and ≤ 15 mg/kg  once weekly  for 12 weeks.  
Additionally, a study is ongoing in which  panitumumab  was administered  weekly  to monkeys  at doses  
of ≤ 30 mg/kg for 26 weeks. The 30-mg/kg/week dose used in the toxicology studies  provides a 6- fold 
safety  margin  (AUC- based)  to the clinical  dose of 2.5 mg/kg once weekly  and an approximately 4.5- fold 
safety margin  (AUC- based)  to a clinical  dose of 6.0 mg/kg once every 2  weeks or 9.0 mg/kg once every  
3 weeks.  The principal  treatment -related  findings  observed in these  studies were  diarrhea  and skin rash,  
which  were  considered  to be related  to the pharmacologic  action  of panitumumab. Dehydration and 
electrolyte  disturbances were  observed  in early  studies and were  considered  likely  to be associated  with 
severe diarrhea.   Therefore,  fluid  support  was administered  in subsequent  studies  to prevent  dehydration. 
 
Reproductive  tox icity studies evaluating the effects  of panitumumab  on embryofetal  development and 
female  fertility  are ongoing (in-life complete).  In the embryofetal  development study, panitumumab  
was administered  once weekly  at doses of 7.5, 15, or 30 mg/kg to pregnant  cynomolgus  monkeys during 
the period of organogenesis. A  preliminary  review  of the data showed that fetal abortions  occurred  in all 
dose groups, and thus, panitumumab  should not be administered  to pregnant  women,  and women  of 
childbearing potential  as well as men should continue  to use contraception during panitumumab  therapy 
and for [ADDRESS_1046286] dose is administered.  In the fertility  study, panitumumab (7.5, 15, or 30 
mg/kg)  was administered  once weekly  to female cynomolgus  monkeys  before mating  and through early  
pregnancy;  based  on an initial review  of the draft data,  minimal- to-severe skin rash and/or  diarrhea,  
decreased  food consumption, and body weight  loss (sometimes resulting  in amenorrhea)  were  observed  
in some animals in all  dose  groups  (14). 
 
The mechanism  of action  of panitumumab is not expected  to be mutagenic  or carcinogenic,  and no 
structural alerts regarding carcinogenicity  have  been identified  for this drug class.  Additionally,  
panitumumab  is neither  a growth hormone  nor an immunosuppressant. Thus, mutagenicity  or 
carcinogenicity  studies  are considered unnecessary.  This approach is consistent  with International  
Committee on Harmonization (ICH)  guidelines.

Panitumumab Clinical Safety  Experience 
The below  referenced  studies reflect  the reported  adverse events  at the time of the last Panitumumab  
Investigator’s  Brochure  (14). Please  refer to the current  version  of the Panitumumab  Investigator’s  
Brochure  as well as the updated safety  information contained in the Investigational  New Drug  safety  
letters  for further updates. 
Safety  analyses from  16 clinical  studies in subjects with a variety  of solid  tumors  (n = 1599 receiving  
panitumumab) indicated  that panitumumab is generally  well tolerated.  Among these studies,  11 enrolled  
subjects with mCRC (n = 1052 receiving  panitumumab  as a single  agent). In these subjects,  
dermatologic -related  toxicities  were  the most  frequently reported  adverse events (91%  of subjects),  with

panitumumab  due to dermatologic adverse  events.  
Infusion  reactions to panitumumab  (defined  as any reported allergic  reaction,  hypersensitivity,  
anaphylactoid reaction,  chills, fever,  or dyspnea, occurring within  [ADDRESS_1046288] dose that were  not 
otherwise  designated  as either  anaphylactoid or allergic  reaction)  were  infrequent  (3% of subjects;  < 1% 
severe);  particularly  considering that premedication  was not mandated in study protocols. Infusion  
reactions,  including anaphylactic  reactions,  bronchospasm, and hypotension, have been reported  in the 
clinical  trials  and post-marketing  experience (including fatal outcomes). Fatal  reactions  have also been 
observed in patients  with a history  of prior  hypersensitivity reaction  to panitumumab including a case of 
fatal angioedema  occurring more  than 24 hours following  the administration  of panitumumab, 
Panitumumab  antigenicity, as measured  by [CONTACT_28745]- linked immunosorbent  assay  (ELISA)  and Biacore  
assay,  was very  low and was not associated  with clinical sequelae.  
Acute renal  failure has been observed in patients  who develop  severe diarrhea  and dehydration. 
Please refer to the current Panitumumab  Investigator’s  Brochure  for further details  (14).  
[IP_ADDRESS] Panitumumab Safety  Monotherapy Studi es 
An integrated  analysis of the safety  of panitumumab has been  conducted for 1052 subjects with mCRC  
receiving  panitumumab  monotherapy (mCRC  Monotherapy Set). Subjects  primarily  received  
panitumumab  doses  of 2.5 mg/kg once weekly  (15%) or 6.0 mg/kg every  2 weeks (82%).  
Consistent  with the published data on subjects treated  with EGFr  inhibitors  (ie, class/target  effect)  
(Perez- Soler  and Saltz,  2005), the most  commonly  reported  treatment -related  adverse  events  in subjects 
treated  with panitumumab were  associated  with the skin, including pruritus  (52%),  acneiform  dermatitis  
(51%),  erythema  (50%),  and rash (38%).  Most  subjects  (833 of 1052 subjects,  79%)  with any 
dermatologic  toxicity  had events  that were  considered  to be mild or moderate.  Only 3% of subjects 
permanently discontinued panitumumab administration  for dermatologic  toxicities.  Dermatologic  
toxicities  typi[INVESTIGATOR_763482], with a median  time to first 
integument  toxicity  (of any severity) of 10 days (95% CI: 8, 11). 
Other  common  treatment -related  adverse  events  (ie, subject  incidence  ≥ 10%)  included fatigue  (15%) 
and diarrhea (13%).  
Subjects  in the wild-type KRAS  subset  received  a higher  number  of panitumumab infusions  compared  
with subjects in the mutant  subset  (mean  [median]  10.0 [8.0]  and 4.9 [4.0],  respectively).  More  treatment -
related  adverse events  occurred  in the wild-type KRAS  subset  compared  with the mutant  KRAS  
subset,  presumably  due to the greater number of panitumumab  infusions received.  These adverse events  
were  mainly  skin toxicities  (erythema,  pruritus,  dermatitis  acneiform)  likely  reflecting  the increased  
duration of exposure  to panitumumab. No qualitative  differences in overall  adverse events were 
observed between the wild -type KRAS  subset,  the mutant  KRAS  subset  and the overall  population,  
however, treatment  related  grade  3 adverse events were  reported  for 25% of subjects in the wild-type 
KRAS  subset  compared  with 12% of subjects in the mutant  KRAS  subset.  Two percent  of wild-type 
KRAS  subjects  and 1% of mutant  KRAS  subjects withdrew for panitumumab -related  events. 
Infusion reactions to pa nitumumab  were  infrequent even though premedication  was not mandated  in the 
panitumumab  clinical  program. Overall,  1% of subjects had an infusion reaction  reported  by [CONTACT_763512].  Using  a definition consistent  with the Vectibix  USPI  (2007), 3% of

[IP_ADDRESS] Safety  of Panitumumab  in Combination  with Chemotherapy  
 
To date,  panitumumab  has been evaluated  in combination with chemotherapy in subjects with CRC,  
NSCLC,  and SCCHN.  
In the mCRC  setting  in combination with IFL (Study 20025409), the incidence  of grade 3 or 4 diarrhea  
(58%)  was notably higher than that historically  expected  for this already  highly GI-toxic chemotherapy  
regimen,  and [ADDRESS_1046289]  had an epi[INVESTIGATOR_254335] 4 diarrhea  that was also considered serious.  Of note, 
panitumumab  in combination with the FOLFIRI  regimen  using the same agents but different  
doses/infusion times  was better  tolerated  with an incidence  of grade  3 or 4 diarrhea similar to that 
expected  from the literature  for this chemotherapy regimen  alone  (25%) (14). These  data suggest  that 
the potential  for additive  toxicities  in the gastrointestinal tract exists  when  panitumumab is administered  
in combination with GI-toxic  chemotherapy.  However,  these  toxicities  could  be managed  by 
[CONTACT_763513].  
No clear  additive  effects were  observed in the NSCLC setting  where  panitumumab  was combined with 
carboplatin/paclitaxel  (Study 20025404). One case of pulmonary fibrosis  was reported in a subject 
treated  with this combination. Although subjects with evidence  of interstitial pneumonitis  or pulmonary 
fibrosis  were  excluded from clinical  studies  (from  [ADDRESS_1046290]), this subject,  who had a previous 
history  of underlying idiopathic  pulmonary fibrosis,  was enrolled  before  the protocol  exclusions were  
implemented. 
[COMPANY_010]  study  20040249 ( PACCE)  is an open- label,  controlled  study of bevacizumab  and chemotherapy 
administered  with and without  panitumumab  as first- line treatment of subjects with mCRC.  
Chemotherapy included oxaliplatin -or irinotecan -based  regimens.  Based  on the results  of a planned  
interim  analysis (conducted after 257 progression or death  events had occurred), adding panitumumab to 
bevacizumab  and oxaliplatin -based  chemotherapy did not prolong progression- free survival  and 
contributed increased  toxicity  to the multi- agent  regimens. Panitumumab  treatment  was discontinued 
from  the study at that time  (22 March  2007).  
A final analysis of on-treatment  efficacy  and safety was  performed based  on available data as of [ADDRESS_1046291]-line 
treatment  of metastatic colorectal  cancer.

 1.2.2    5- Fluorouracil  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pharmacology of 5- Fluorouracil  
5-FU, 5-fluoro -2,4(1H,3H) -pyrimidinedione, is an antineoplastic  antimetabolite,  is a colorless to 
faint yellow  aqueous, sterile,  nonpyrogenic  injectable  solution  for intravenous  administration.  
This antimetabolite  has been used since its advent in the 1950s and has cell cycle specific 
activity  in the S-phase.  Its main  target  after conversion to the metabolite  FdUMP  is the enzyme  
thymidylate synthase  (15).  It can be incorporated into both DNA and  RNA resulting  in alteration  
and disruption of normal  function and ultimately leading  to cell death. With  regard  to colorectal  
cancer treatment,  it has been long the standard  of care in the  adjuvant  setting  in combination with 
leucovorin (16). Given  the paucity of active agents in this disease,  it was also the mainstay  in the  
metastatic setting.  The drug is generally  well tolerated  with side effects most  commonly related  
to the rate of infusion.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Toxicities  
Please refer to t he FDA approved package  insert  for more  details  about  a comprehensive  list of 
adverse events.  Stomatitis  and esophagopharyngitis  (which  may lead to sloughing and 
ulceration),  diarrhea,  anorexia, nausea and emesis are commonly seen during therapy.  
Leukopenia usually follows every  course of adequate therapy with fluorouracil.  The lowest  white  
blood cell counts  are commonly  observed between  the 9th and 14th days after the first course  of 
treatment,  although uncommonly the maximal  depression may be  delayed  for as long as [ADDRESS_1046292]  often  seen is a pruritic  
maculopapular  rash usually  appearing on the extremities  and less frequently on the trunk. It is 
generally  reversible  and usually responsive  to symptomatic  treatment.  Other  adverse reactions  
are: Hematologic:  pancytopenia, thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis, anemia.  Cardiovascular:  
myocardial  ischemia,  angina. Gastrointestinal: gastrointestinal ulceration  and bleeding. Allergic  
reactions:  anaphylaxis  and generalized  allergic  reactions.  Neurologic:  acute cerebellar  syndrome  
(which  may persist  following  discontinuance  of treatment),  nystagmus,  headache.  Dermatologic:  
dry skin, fissuring, photosensitivity,  as manifested  by [CONTACT_763514][INVESTIGATOR_763483]; vein pi[INVESTIGATOR_371];  palmar -plantar  erythrodysesthesia  syndrome,  as manifested  by [CONTACT_763515] f eet following  by [CONTACT_77368], erythema,  and swelling.  Ophthalmic: Lacrimal  duct 
stenosis,  visual  changes,  lacrimation,  photophobia. Psychiatric: disorientation,  confusion, 
euphoria. Miscellaneous:  thrombophlebitis, epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940], nail  changes  (including  loss of nails).  (17) 
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Clinical Studies  with 5-FU 
Many  studies  have been performed  with 5-FU in the setting  of colorectal  cancer.  Many  of the 
early  studies  focused  on the schedule  of giving the 5- FU: bolus vs. infusional regimens  (18, 19). 
More  recently,  the focus of studies  with 5-FU have been  in conjunction with oxaliplatin  or 
irinotecan  in regimens  such as FOLFOX  or FOLFIRI.  These  latter combinations  when  compared  
to a 5- FU/LV  in Phase  III studies  proved to have superior response rates,  progression free 
survival (20, 21) and survival  (20). FOLFOX  and FOLFIRI  appear  to be equivalent  regimens  
in the metastatic setting  (22, 23).

 1.2.3. Irinotecan  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharmacology of Irinotecan  
Irinotecan  is a water  soluble camptothecin  analog. Camptothecin  is an alkaloid obtained from  the  
Camptotheca acuminata tree. The subcellular  target  of camptothecin  and camptothecin 
analogues  in mammalian  cells is the nuclear  enzyme topoisomerase I (Topo I) which  is encoded 
by a single  copy gene mapped to human  chromosome  20q11.2- 13.1 (27). This enzyme,  along 
with the nuclear  enzyme  topoisomerase II (Topo II) modulates  the topological  structure  of DNA 
by [CONTACT_763516],  thereby [CONTACT_763517].  Topo I induces single -strand  DNA breaks  after covalently  linking to the 3' terminus  
of DNA,  and subsequently facilitates  DNA religation.  The camptothecins, along with Topo I 
and DNA,  establish  a reversible  cleavable  complex, inhibiting  the religation  of DNA.  The DNA  
replication  machinery  then converts  single -strand  breaks  to lethal  double -strand  breaks  (27). 
In vivo, cellular  carboxylesterases  cleave the ester bond of irinotecan, which  is inactive,  thereby  
[CONTACT_763518]-38, (7-ethyl -10-hydroxycamptothecin). SN-38 is estimated  
to be  250-1000 fold more potent  as a topoisomerase -I inhibitor than irinotecan  (28,29). Mutations  
of the Topo I gene and stable  decrements in Topo I activity  are implied  in tumor resistance 
to irinotecan  (30,31). Exposure to irinotecan  has also been  shown  to produce  a rapid,  transient  
decrease in Topo I concentration in vitro and in vivo, which  in cell cultures  correlates with a 
decrease in irinotecan  cytotoxicity  throughout the exposure period (30). 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Toxicities  
See section  6.9.2. Below . 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Clinical Studies  with  Irinotecan  
Significant  clinical  activity  has been reported  in phase  II trials  of irinotecan  in patients  with 
small -cell and non-small -cell lung cancer  (NSCLC),  colorectal  cancer,  squamous cell carcinoma  
of the cervix, ovarian cancer,  stomach  cancer  and lymphoma  (28). Irinotecan  added to 5FU and 
leucovorin is one of the standards  of care in the treatment  of MCRC.  While  bolus irinotecan  
regimens  when given with 5-FU and leucovorin, were  found to have a significant  effect  on 
mortality  (32),  the continuous  infusion regimens were  found to be very effective in both the 
adjuvant  and metastatic settings  (33). Currently  the preferred  method  to administer  this 
combination  is the bimonthly  regimen  with infusional  5FU (FOLFIRI).  The bimonthly regimen  
tends  to be very well tolerated  by [CONTACT_763519].  
 
1.3. Rationale for Performing  the Study  
 
The rationale  for this study stems out from the following:  1- FOLFIRI  is an active  combination  
in the  first and second  line treatment  of MCRC with a high impact on survival. 2- EGFR is a well 
established  target  in colorectal  cancer.  3- There  is significant  preclinical  rationale  to add 
panitumumab  to irinotecan. Clinically,  EGFR  targeting  monoclonal antibodies, such as 
panitumumab, enhance  the activity  of irinotecan  in patients  in first line therapy (13) as well in 
patients  who are already refractory  to irinotecan  (34,35). The results  of a phase  3 trial evaluating 
panitumumab  in combination with FOLFIRI  vs. FOLFIRI  alone  as a second- line treatment  in 
1,186 patients  with metastatic colorectal  cancer  (mCRC)  showed  that panitumumab  significantly

OSU PROTOCOL #: [ZIP_CODE]  VERSION: 09/19/2017

 improved progression- free survival  in combination with FOLFIRI  (5.9 mos),  compared  to 
FOLFIRI  alone  (3.9 mos),  in patients  with  KRAS  wild -type mCRC(36).  
 
The proposed strategy  of adding panitumumab  to patients  having progressed  on first line 
FOLFIRI -Bevacizumab  has many  advantages.  There  is a high response  rate (> 20%) with the 
combination  of Irinotecan  and cetuximab  in patients  who already  failed  irinotecan  (34,35 ) 
equaling or surpassing all of the reported  second  line response  rates (< 25%)  from  other  studies  
(37,38). Irinotecan,  unlike oxaliplatin has no known cumulative toxicity.  Therefore  this treatment  
strategy,  to deliver second  line therapy  in a sequential  fashion after the patient  has progressed  on 
first line FOLFIRI  + bevacizumab,  is feasible leaving the patients  yet with an option for an 
active combination (FOLFOX) in the third line.  
 
As per the NCCN guidelines, irinotecan  in combination with cetuximab  is an acceptable second  
or third line of therapy  after a patient has progressed  on irinotecan  based  chemotherapy. This is 
based  on the BOND 1 and BOND 2 study data showing that response  rates and median  TTP 
were  superior  when  cetuximab was added to irinotecan  vs. cetuximab  alone  in patients who 
already  failed  irinotecan  (34,35). These efficacy  parameters were  comparable  to salvage 
responses with oxaliplatin based  regimen.  This sets the stage  for the rational  for our study with 
panitumumab. 
 
Give
n the rationale  stated  above, we propose a phase II study looking at the addition of 
panitumumab  to FOLFIRI  upon disease progression with FOLFIRI  plus bevacizumab.  FOLFIRI  
is superior  to irinotecan  alone  in patients  who failed  5-FU in the first line (39).  Thus,5- FU 
resistance is less relevant and the possible synergism/additivity  of 5- FU with oxaliplatin  and 
irinotecan  justifies  continuing its across lines of therapy. This study hypothesizes the possibility 
that a cancer  becomes resistant  to the FOLFIRI  regimen,  and that adding panitumumab will 
restore  sensitivity  to the regimen.  This study will provide  us with direct  prospective  data on the 
activity of  FOLFIRI  added to a novel  targeted  agent,  panitumumab. The objective of the study is  
to determine  the efficacy  of this second  line therapeutic  regimen  in patients  with locally  advanced, 
unresectable  or metastatic  colorectal  carcinoma.  The regimens  consist  of mFOLFIRI  [5-
fluorouracil  and irinotecan]  and panitumumab . 
 
There  is considerable va riability  of the metastatic colorectal  cancer  clinical  response  to anti- 
EGFR agents.  Thus  there  is a pressing  need  to identify  reliable  markers with a predictive  value 
to select  the appropriate patients  who can benefit from  these treatments.  There  has  been reporting  
of the characterization  of molecular  markers predictive  of anti-EGFR  antibodies  sensitivity  in 
colorectal  cancer.  A study including 30 mCRC  patients  reported  that KRAS  mutation  was 
highly predictive of tumor resistance  to cetuximab (40). The [ADDRESS_1046293]  of KRAS  codon 12 and 13 mutation status on patients’ 
progression free survival  with panitumumab compared  to best supportive  care,  there  was an 
increase from  7.4 to 12.3 weeks in those patients  who were  had no evidence  of mutations  (41). 
On July 17th , 2009, The U.S. Food and Drug  Administration  ( FDA)  has recently  approved the 
change  in label  for panitumumab indicating  the utility  of KRAS  gene te sting  as a predictive

 biomarker  in patients  with mCRC  . The Panitumumab  Randomized  Trial  in Combination with 
Chemotherapy for Metastatic  Colorectal  Cancer  to Determine Efficacy  (PRIME)  was a 
randomized  phase  3 study in which  panitumumab was given  in combination with oxaliplatin  and 
5FU (FOLFOX4)  vs FOLFOX4  alone, and patients were  prospectively selected  for KRAS  exon 
2 (codon 12 and 13) wild-type tumors.  There  was an improvement  in progression free survival  
from  8 to 9.6 months with the addition of panitumumab (HR 0.8; 95% CI 0.66- 0.97, p= 0.02) but 
no statistically  significant benefit  in overall  survival,  23.9 vs 19.7 months, respectively.  (42) 
_Retrospective  analysis of this study  identified  patients  with additional  RAS  mutations  such as 
KRAS  exon 3 (codon 61) and exon 4 (codons  117 and 146) and NRAS  exon 2 (codons  12 and 
13) and exon 3 (codon 61). Patients  now identified  without  any RAS  mutations  had an 
improvement  in their progression free survival  with the addition of panitumumab to FOLFOX4,  
10.1 months vs 7.9 months with FOLFOX4  alone (HR 0.72; 95% CI 0.58-0.90 p=0.004)  and 
overall  survival  from 26 vs 20.2 months (HR 0.78;  95% CI 0.62- 0.99 p=0,04).(43)  The FIRE -[ADDRESS_1046294]- line therapy  
has prospectively looked  at these additional  RAS  mutations, and there  was a greater  benefit  seen 
in patients  treated  with  FOLFIRI and  cetuximab  if they wild-type for all RAS mutations. (44)  
 
Thus,
 enrollment  to this trial requires  that patient  tumors  are checked  for RAS  mutation  (KRAS  
exon 3 (codon 61) and exon 4 (codons  117 and 146) and NRAS  exon 2 (codons  12 and 13) and 
exon 3 (codon 61)). Only tumors  that do not have  these mutations  will render  patients  eligible  to 
receive panitumumab  and enroll  onto this study.  
 
1.4.1 Rationale for correlative study  
Initially,  our study selected  only KRAS  wild-type tumors  for exon 2 (codon 12 and 13) but not 
for the additional  RAS  mutations  [KRAS  exon 3 (codon 61) and exon 4 (codons  117 and 146) 
and NRAS  exon 2 (codons  12 and 13), exon 3 (codon 61), and exon 4 (codons  117 and 146)]. 
Thus, we proposed to collect  patient  tumor samples so that we could  retrospectively  analyze  
them  for the additional  RAS  mutations  to see if progression- free survival  and overall  survival  are 
impacted  by [CONTACT_763520]. If  patient  tumors  are analyzed  for the additional  RAS  mutations  
prior to enrollment,  then tissue collection  is not necessary.

 3. STUDY DESIGN 
 
3.1. Study  design  
 
This is an open -label,  prospective  phase II clinical trial, with a primary  endpoint of progression- 
free survival (PFS).  Patients must  fail a combination of FOLFIRI  and bevacizumab  prior  to 
being considered  for this study. At the time of consideration, all participants  will be screened  for 
RAS  mutations  and only patients  who are considered  RAS -wild type [KRAS  exon 2 (codon 12 
and 13), KRAS  exon 3 (codon 61) and exon 4 (codons 117 and 146) and NRAS  exon 2 (codons  
12 and 13), exon 3 (codon 61), and exon 4 (codons 117 and 146)]will  be enrolled  on the study. 
Patients  eligible  for this study will receive a modified regimen  of FOLFIRI  as outlined  in this 
study along with panitumumab as outlined  in section  6.2. Each  cycle will consist  of days 1 and 
15 as outlined  in section  6.2. Patients  will be restaged  after 2 cycles of therapy.  If there  is no 
evidence of progressive  disease,  patient  will continue on study. They  will be monitored at regular  
intervals  with serial  laboratory  testing  as well as periodic  scans to assess response to treatment  as 
outlined in section  5.5. 
 
3.2  Sample Size and Accrual  Rat e: 
A total of [ADDRESS_1046295] the null hypothesis  that there  is no difference in 
median  PFS between  the study regimen  and the historical control. Please refer to Section  9 for 
details  regarding the statistical  methods. We anticipate a uniform  accrual  rate of 2 patients  with 
KRAS  wild type mCRC  per month  from  the 2 participating  institutions (The Ohio  State  
University  (lead)  ), no lost to follow -up, and an additional [ADDRESS_1046296] fulfill each  of the following criteria:

of therapy prior  to enrolling onto the study was FOLFIRI  and bevacizumab  received  no 
more  than [ADDRESS_1046297] been treated  with 
FOLFIRI  plus bevacizumab  until disease progression  is radiographically documented  
2. Patients’  tumors  will need  to be tested  for the RAS mutation  status.   Only  those patients  with 
wild-type or  unmutated RAS oncogene  are eligible to participate in this study.  
3. Provide  wr itten informed  consent  prior to study -specific screening  procedures,  with the 
understanding that the patient  has the right to withdraw  from  the study at any time,  without  
prejudice. 
4. Prior cetuximab  is allowed  in the adjuvant  but not in the metastatic  setting , but must  have 
been completed  at least  6 months  before  enrolling  on this trial.  
5. Age > 18 years 
6. ECOG performance status < 1

**Patients  have the right to withdraw from  the study at any time for any reason.  The investigator  
also has the right to withdraw  patients  from the study in the event  of intercurrent illness,  adverse  
events,  treatment  failure,  protocol  violations, administrative reasons or other reasons.  
 
7. STUDY MEDICATION  
 
7.1. Drug  Formulation,  Packaging, and Storage  
 
7.1.1 5-Fluorouracil:  
Storage  and Stability - Although fluorouracil solution may discolor  slightly  during storage,  the 
potency and safety  are not adversely  affected.  Store  at controlled room  temperature  15° to 30°C 
(59°to 86°F). Protect  from light.  Retain  in carton  until time  of use. 
23 THE  OHIO  STATE  UNIVERSITY  
IRB PROTOCOL #: 2012C0033 
OSU PROTOCOL #: [ZIP_CODE]  VERSION: 09/19/2017  
IRB Approved:  tracked   
 Administration - 5FU should be administered  only intravenously, using care to avoid  
extra vasation.  Extravasation  should be handled according to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_320049]. Patients  will be 
given a bolus of 400 mg/m2 to be followed by a continuous  infusion  over 46 hrs at a dose of 
2400mg/m2. 
Leucovorin will be administered  at a dose of 200 mg/m2 over 120 minutes  prior  to the 5- FU 
bolus. Leucovorin may be run simultaneously with irinotecan  infusion via y- site connection. 
 
7.1.2 Irinotecan:  
 
Storage  and stability - Irinotecan  vials must  be stored  in a cool,  dry place,  protected  from light in 
a locked cabinet  accessible only to authorized individuals. It is stable for at least three  years at 
room  temperature.  Irinotecan  is stable for at least 24 hours  in glass bottles  or plastic  bags after 
reconstitution  with  D5W.  
 
Administration - Irinotecan  is diluted  with 5% dextrose (D5W)  to a total volume  of 500 mL and 
infused intravenously over  90 minutes. Nothing else should be added to the bag. Patients will be 
given a dose of 180 mg/M2 by [CONTACT_104488]. 
 
7.1.3 Panitumumab  (Refer to Appendix  4): 
Panitumumab  will be manufactured  and packaged  by [CONTACT_763524]’s  
clinical  trial drug distribution  procedures. Each  vial of panitumumab  will contain 20 mL of a 
sterile  protein  solution containing a 20- mg/mL  solution of panitumumab. The vial will contain 
approximately 400mg  of panitumumab and is for single  dose use only. Each  vial of 
panitumumab  will be labeled  in accordance with current  ICH GCP,  FDA  and specific national 
requirements.  
The supplied investigational  drug must  be stored  at 2-8° C in a secured  area upon receipt.  As 
panitumumab  contains  no preservatives,  vials are designed for single  use only. Exposure of the 
material  to excessive temperature  above  or below this range  should be avoided. Do not allow  
panitumumab  to freeze and do not use if contents  freeze in transit or in storage.  If vials fall out 
of specified  temperature  requirement,  please contact  [CONTACT_763525].  
Records  of the actual  storage  condition during the period of the study must  be maintained  (ie, 
records  of the date and time and initials  of person checking, and the “working day” temperature  
of the refrigerator used for storage  of trial supplies, continuous  temperature  recordings, or 
regularly  maintained  temperature  alarm  systems used in conjunction with  temperature  recording). 
 
7.2. Protocol  Dosage Regimen  and Administration  
Prophylactic  Skin Treatment: The day before treatment  is initiated,  patients  will be given  
minocycline  at a dose of 100 mg PO bid followed by [CONTACT_763526] a dose of 100 mg PO 
qd for the duration  of therapy. In the STEPP study (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_763486], Abs 394, ASCO GI 2009), 
patients  who received  prophylactic  therapy (doxycycline)  had a significant  reduction in the 
incidence  and severity  of rash.  There  was also an improvement  in the risk of diarrhea  when  
panitumumab  was added  to irinotecan  in the presence  of a prophylactic strategy.

IRB PROTOCOL #: 2012C0033 
OSU PROTOCOL #: [ZIP_CODE]  VERSION: 09/19/2017  
IRB Approved:  tracked   
 If patient experiences reaction  to minocycline, it will be discontinued. The trial will proceed  
without  modification.  
 
It is also recommended  patients wear sunscreen and hats  and limit sun exposure. 
 
On days one and 15 of a cycle the following drugs  will be administered:  Irinotecan  180 mg/m2, 
5-FU 400 mg/m2 bolus, leucovorin 200 mg/m2, panitumumab  6 mg/kg. Finally  the patient  will 
be given a pump  to continue  to receive their infusional 5- FU at a total dose of 2400mg/M2 over 
[ADDRESS_1046313] on each treatment  day. A cycle of therapy is 
28 days  and the regimen  is repeated  on Day 29. 
 
Of note: if a patient  has required  dose reduction  of FOLFIRI  chemotherapy  with their previous 
administrations,  then such dose reductions  will continue  at the time of enrollment in this  protocol  
with the exceptions  of sub-optimally  controlled  nausea,  vomiting,  diarrhea,  neutropenia, and 
anemia.  Patients  with more  than 50% reduction of the original  dose of infusional 5FU and/or  
irinotecan  will not be allowed  on the study (see section  4.2.9). The aforementioned side effects  
should be attempted  to be controlled  with the appropriate  supportive  measures and the full dose 
of irinotecan  should be given. 
Premedication  for c hemotherapy may be administered  prior  to, during, or after panitumumab  
administration  (if given during panitumumab administration,  pre-medications  should be given 
through a separate IV line).  Panitumumab  will be administered  until subjects develop disease  
progression or are unable to tolerate panitumumab. 
 
The panitumumab dose will  be calculated  based  on the subject’s actual  body weight  at baseline  
and will not be re-calculated  unless  the actual  body weight  changes  at least by + 10%. The total 
dose  may be rounded up or down  by [CONTACT_375650] 10 mg. The panitumumab  dose will be 
diluted  in a minimum  of 100 mL of pyrogen- free 0.9% sodium chloride  solution USP (normal  
saline solution, supplied by [CONTACT_779]).  The maximum  concentration of the diluted  solution to be 
infused should not exceed  10 mg/mL.  The volume of normal  saline should be increased  as 
needed  to ensure the maximum  concentration  of the diluted  solution does not exceed  10 mg/mL.  
Panitumumab  will be administered  IV by [CONTACT_763527] a peripheral  line or 
indwelling  catheter  using  a 0.22- micron  in-line filter infusion set-up over 1 hour ± [ADDRESS_1046314]’s  actual  weight  requires  greater  than 150- 
mL volume infusion, panitumumab will be administered  over 60 to 90 minutes ± [ADDRESS_1046315] Operating  Pr ocedures  and 
promptly forwarded to the clinical  research  center  for infusion.  
 
The 
effects of overdose of panitumumab are not known. 
 
The doses  of irinotecan  and 5- FU will be calculated  on the basis  of milligrams  of drug per square  
meter  of body surface area (BSA).  As the weight  of the patient  may change  throughout  the 
study, the dose will be recalculated  based  on the new body surface area prior  to the start of each 
cycle.  Refer to Appendix  2:  BSA Nomogram  for assessment  of body surface area

7.3. Duration  of treatment  
Duration  of individual  patient  treatment will depend on individual  response and tolerance.  Patients  
with clearly  documented progressive  disease must  be taken  off therapy with FOLFIRI  + 
Panitumumab  at time of progression. Patients  who are responding (complete  or partial),  or 
whose  disease is stable,  will be treated  until progression of disease,  intolerable  toxicity,  patient  
refusal  to continue  with study, or investigator  decision  to remove  patient from  study in 
accordance with  section  6.8.  Patients who have stable disease or better  and have completed 6 
cycles of therapy, may at the treating physician’s discretion, continue with therapy or switch to 
single- agent panitumumab therapy, for improved tolerance.  They may not switch back to 
FOLFIRI + Panitumumab and will be taken off trial should they have disease progression. 
 
7.4. Dose Adjustment for 5FU and Irinotecan  Toxicities  
 
A cycle is 4 weeks – with treatment  on days 1 and 15. We do not make  up day #15 treatments if 
a patient  should require  adjustment or omission based  on outlined criteria below. 
 
 This study will take into consideration previous  toxicities  experienced  with FOLFIRI  
prior  to enrollment. The initial dose of FOLFIRI  will determined  by [CONTACT_763528].  Prior to enrollment, if the patient  experienced  significant  toxicity  
with FOLFIRI  and dose adjustments  were  required, these dose adjustments  will continue  
upon initiation  of this trial. 
 
 For toxicities  which  are considered  by [CONTACT_763529]–threatening  events  (e.g. alopecia,  altered  taste etc.),  treatment  will be continued at the 
same  dose without  reduction or interruption.  In addition, no dose reductions  or 
interruptions  will be required for anemia as it can be satisfactorily  managed  by 
[CONTACT_27752].  
 
 For any event that is apparent  at baseline,  the dose modifications  will apply according to 
the corresponding shift in toxicity grade, if the investigator feels it is appropriate.  (e.g. if 
a patient  has grade  1 asthenia at  baseline  which  increases to grade  2 during treatment,  this 
will be considered  as a shift of 1 grade  and treated  as a grade  1 toxicity  for dose 
modification purposes). 
 
 If on the first day of chemotherapy treatment,  the granulocyte  count  (ANC)  is < 1,500 or 
the platelet  count  is < 75,000, treatment  will be held for up to three  weeks until ANC is ≥  
1200 and platelet  count  is ≥ 75,000. CBC should be obtained at least weekly  when  
treatment  is held. Chemotherapy doses  will not be reduced  based  on nadir  counts  except  
in febrile neutropenia as  defined below . 
 
 If the dose is modified to manage  an adverse event, it is recommended  that the patient  be 
seen by [CONTACT_385472] -starting  study drug. 
 
 If a rest period is extended  due to toxicity,  the “complete"  cycle should be given afterwards  
with chemotherapy  and panitumumab. If toxicity  requires a dosing delay/interruption   
of  both  5- FU  and  irinotecan   of  more   than  six  weeks  or  at  the

 volume of normal  saline  should be increased  as needed  to ensure  the maximum  concentration  of 
the diluted  solution does not exceed  10 mg/mL.  Panitumumab will be administered  IV by [CONTACT_763530]  a peripheral  line or indwelling  catheter using  a 0.22- micron  in-line 
filter  infusion  set-up over 1 hour  ± [ADDRESS_1046318] infusion is well tolerated  (ie without  any serious infusion- related  reactions)  all subsequent

minutes  ± [ADDRESS_1046320] Operating  Procedures  and promptly 
forwarded to the  clinical research  center  for infusion. 
The effects of overdose of panitumumab are not known. 
See Appendix 6 Pharmacy  Guide for information on panitumumab packing and formulation,  
labeling, storage,  preparation, supply/return, and accountability. 
 
Pre-medication  for Panitumumab 
Panitumumab  specific pre-medication  is not required  for routine  panitumumab  infusions. If, 
during or after any infusion, a reaction  occurs,  pre-medication  may be used for subsequent  
panitumumab  infusions  according to institutional guideline or investigator’s discretion.  
 
Interruption  of Panitumumab  Infusion 
Subjects  who experience  any serious  infusion reaction  during panitumumab administration  will 
have the infusion stopped. Continuation of dosing will be based  on the severity  and resolution of 
the event  and will be at the discretion  of the investigator.  Suspected  infusion reactions should be 
reported  as an adverse event. All subjects  who experience such an event will be followed for 
safety.  
 
Toxicity  Assessment  
Toxicities  will be recorded  as adverse events  on the Adverse  Event case report  form  and must  be 
graded using  The National  Cancer  Institute’s  Common  Toxicity  Criteria  (CTCAE)  version 4.0 
(Appendix 4), with the exception of skin- or nail-related  toxicities,  which  must  be graded using 
CTCAE version  3.0 with  modifications  (see Appendix 4a). 
 
Panitumumab Dosage  Adjustments  
For subjects who experience toxicities  while  on study, one or more  doses  of panitumumab may 
need to be withheld, reduced, or delayed  (administered  at > 14 day intervals).  On resolution of 
toxicity,  a limited  number  of attempts  to re-escalate reduced  panitumumab doses  will be allowed  
(outlined  in Figure  4). Dose  escalations above 6 mg/kg starting  dose are not allowed.  
Panitumumab  dose reductions  are listed  in Table 3.

Criteria  for Withholding  a Dose of Panitumumab  
Skin- or nail-related  toxicities:  
• Symptomatic  skin- or nail-related  toxicity requiring narcotics,  systemic steroids,  or felt to 
be intolerable by [CONTACT_423]  
• Skin or nail infection  requiring  IV antibiotic or IV antifungal  treatment  
• Need  for surgical  debridement  
• Any skin- or nail-related  serious  adverse event  
 Non -skin- or nail-related  toxicities:  
Any grade 3 or  4 toxicity  with the following exceptions: 
• Panitumumab  will only be withheld  for symptomatic  hypomagnesemia  and/or  
hypocalcemia that  persists despi[INVESTIGATOR_456344]/or calcium  replacement  
• Panitumumab  will only be withheld  for grade  3 or 4 nausea,  diarrhea,  or vomiting that 
persists despi[INVESTIGATOR_763487] (see Section  6.6 and 6.7.1 for diarrhea  management  
guidelines)  
• Panitumuma b will only be withheld  for grade  ≥ 3 anemia  or grade  4 thrombocytopenia  
that can not be  managed  by [CONTACT_29470](s) or cytokine therapy 
 
Criteria  for Re-treatment  with Panitumumab  
Skin- or nail-related  toxicities:  
• Panitumumab  administration  may  recommence once:  
• The adverse event has  improved to ≤ Grade 2 or returned to baseline,  and;  
• The subject  has recovered  to the point where  symptomatic skin- or nail-related  toxicity is  
felt to be tolerable;  and, 
• Systemic steroids  are no longer  required, and 
• IV antibiotic or IV antifungal  treatment is no longer required  
Non-skin- or nail-related  toxicities : 
• Panitumumab  administration  may recommence once the adverse event  has improved to 
≤ Grade 1 or returned  to baseline.  
 
 
Dose Modification  Schedule  
• Subjects  should be assessed  for toxicity  before  each dose.  Dose  modification  should be 
performed according to the  schedule described  below and outlined in Figure 1.

IRB PROTOCOL #: 2012C0033 
OSU PROTOCOL #: [ZIP_CODE]  VERSION: 09/19/2017  
IRB Approved:  tracked   
 • Subjects  who develop a toxicity  that does not meet  the criteria  for withholding a dose of 
panitumumab  (Section  6.5) should continue  to receive panitumumab  and their symptoms  should 
be treated.  
• Panitumumab -related  toxicity  will be considered  resolved  if it improves  to a degree  that 
allows  for re -treatment  with panitumumab (Section  6.5).  
• For subjects  who experience a toxicity  that meets the criteria  for withholding a dose of 
panitumumab:  
• Subjects  receiving  either  100% or 80% of the starting  dose of panitumumab are allowed  
to have up to 2 subsequent  doses  withheld for toxicity.  The second  dose should only be withheld  
if the toxicity  has not resolved by [CONTACT_763531]. Subjects  treated  at 
the 100% dose level  whose  toxicity  resolves after 1 dose of panitumumab is withheld  should be 
re-started  at the 100% dose level  (recommended  but not required,  reduction to the 80% dose is 
allowed  as an  alternative  to re-challenge with the 100% dose). 
• If toxicity  recurs,  subjects treated  at the 100% dose or 80% dose should be re-started  at 
the 80% dose or 50% dose, respectively,  when  the toxicity  resolves after withholding 1 or 2 
doses  of panitumumab.  
• Subjects  trea ted at the 100% dose level  whose  toxicity  resolves  only after 2 subsequent  
doses  of panitumumab are withheld  should be re-started  at the 80% dose level.  
• Subjects  treated  at the 80% dose level  whose toxicity  resolves after withholding 1 or 2 
doses  of panitumumab should be re-started  at the 50% dose level.  
• Subjects  who experience toxicity  at the 50% dose level  will not be  re-treated  with 
panitumumab. 
It is recommended  that panitumumab  doses  will be escalated  in subjects whose toxicity  resolves  
to the degree  that meets  the criteria  for re-starting  a dose of panitumumab (Section  6.5). Dose  
escalations are recommended  but not required. Dose  escalations should occur  in the following 
manner:  
• Subjects  treated  at the 80% dose level  whose  toxicity  does not recur  should receive the 
100% dose level  at the next dose unless  a previous  attempt  to re-escalate  to the 100%  dose level  
was not tolerated  (re-initiation  of the 80% dose is allowed  as an  alternative  to dose escalation).  
• Subjects  treated  at the 50% dose level  whose  toxicity  does not recur  should receive the 
80% dose at the next dose unless  a previous  attempt to re-escalate to the 80% dose level  was not 
tolerated  (re-initiation  of the 60% dose is allowed  as an  alternative to dose escalation).  
• Subjects  who mi ss 3 or more  consecutive  scheduled  doses  due to toxicity or  are unable to 
receive a dose of panitumumab within  6 weeks of  having received  their previous dose  of 
panitumumab  due to toxicity  will be considered  unable to tolerate  panitumumab and will not be 
retreated  with  panitumumab.  
• In case of unexplained respi[INVESTIGATOR_763488]-productive  cough, dyspnea,  
crackles,  or radiological  pulmonary infiltrates,  panitumumab should be discontinued until further  
pulmonary investigation

 Panitumumab Delayed - or Missed -Doses  
Panitumumab  should be administered  by [CONTACT_763532].  
However,  if panitumumab  dose cannot be administered  as scheduled,  every  attempt  should be 
made  to administer  the drug within  3 days of the scheduled  dose (up to 3 days before  the 
scheduled  dose or up to 3 days  after  the scheduled dose). If it is necessary  to change a subject’s visit 
from  the originally  scheduled  date,  the subsequent visits  should continue  at the previously scheduled  
days/dates.  If the dose is  not administered  within  the ± 3-day window, the dose will be considered  a 
missed  dose, and the next scheduled  dose should be given at the time of the regularly  scheduled  
dose.  Missed  doses  will not be made up. 
 
Discontinuation  of Panitumumab  
Panitumumab  will be administered  until subjects are unable  to tolerate  panitumumab, disease 
progression, death, or  study  withdrawal by [CONTACT_423], investigator,  or sponsor 
 
Electrolyte  Management  
Electrolytes  and Magnesium  levels  will be evaluated  as outlined  in the schedule  of assessment  
table  in Section  5.[ADDRESS_1046321]’s  serum  magnesium  level  should be 
maintained  within  the normal  range during study treatment.  
It is important  to assess  and manage  serum  potassium  and calcium  (adjusted  for albumin)  in 
subjects who have concomitant  hypomagnesemia. Subject’s  serum  potassium  and calcium  
parameters are recommended  to be maintained,  as per standard  institutional practice,  within  the 
normal  ranges  during study  treatment.  
Electrolytes  will be followed for 8 weeks after completion of the trial to insure  proper replacement.

7.6. Special  Instructions Regarding  Treatment of Toxicity  
 
Infusion- Related  Toxicity  and Hypersensitivity : 
Careful  attention  to prophylaxis  and bedside  monitoring  of vital signs  is recommended.  
Discontinue  therapy for anaphylaxis. Mild  symptoms:  (e.g., mild flushing, rash,  pruritus): 
complete infusion, supervise at bedside. No treatment  required. Panitumumab  is contraindicated  
in patienst  with a history  of life-threatening  hypersensitivity reaction  to panitumumab  or any of 
the excipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  
 
Moderate Symptoms:  (e.g., moderate  rash,  flushing, mild dyspnea,  chest  discomfort): Stop 
chemotherapy infusion. Give  intravenous  diphenhydramine  25 mg and intravenous  
dexamethasone 10 mg. Resume infusion  after recovery  of symptoms  at a low rate of infusion, 20 
mg/hr  for 15 minutes. Then, if no further  symptoms develop, resume  infusion at full dose rate 
until infusion has been completed.  If symptoms recur,  stop infusion. Remove  patient  from  
protocol  therapy.  Report as an  adverse event. 
 
Severe Life-threatening  Symptoms: (e.g., hypotension requiring  pressor  therapy, angioedema,  
respi[INVESTIGATOR_763489], generalized  urticaria): Stop infusion. Give  
intravenous  diphenhydramine  and dexamethasone,  as indicated above. Add epi[INVESTIGATOR_665725] / or 
bronchodilators  if indicated. If wheezing is present  and is not responsive  to adrenaline,  then 
administer  0.35 ml of nebulized salbutamol  solution (or equivalent). Remove  patient  from  
protocol  therapy.  Report as an  adverse event. 
 
Diarrhea  
Irinotecan  can cause diarrhea,  and should be stopped at diarrhea grade ≥ 2, and treated  
symptomatically  (recommend  IV hydration and use of loperamide  for diarrhea,  observing 
loperamide  dosage recommendation and treatment  start,  see below).  If control takes longer  than 
2 days, medical  evaluation including relevant  diagnostic  procedures, alternative  treatment  and 
possible investigation  of DPD deficiency  should be considered. Irinotecan  cannot  be re-started  
until diarrhea  has resolved  to grade  < [ADDRESS_1046322] 24 hours  
beforehand.  
The recommended  dosage  regimen  for loperamide:  [ADDRESS_1046323] 12 hours. During  the night, 
34 THE  OHIO  STATE  UNIVERSITY  
IRB PROTOCOL #: 2012C0033 
OSU PROTOCOL #: [ZIP_CODE]  VERSION: 09/19/2017  
IRB Approved:  tracked   
 the patient  may take 4 mg of loperamide  every  4 hours. Note:  This dosage regimen  exceeds the 
usual  dosage  recommendations  for loperamide. Premedication  with loperamide  is not 
recommended.  
The use of drugs  with laxative  properties  should be avoided because of the potential for 
exacerbation  of diarrhea.  Patients  should be advised  to contact  [CONTACT_763534]. 
 
Grade ≥ 2 Nausea/Vomiting  
For nausea  and vomiting the  patients  must  be supplied with anti-emetics in order  to help 
themselves in case nausea or vomiting  occurs  at home.  The choice and dose of anti-emetics will 
be determined  by [CONTACT_56951]. Adequate  secondary  prophylactic  treatment  and IV 
hydration should be initiated  once nausea or vomiting  has occurred.  If the adverse event recurs 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_430903], then dose modifications  should also  be according to the  table above. 
 
Fever/Infection  with  or without  neutropenia  
Chemotherapy should be stopped immediately.  Appropriate  anti-infective  therapy  should be 
initiated.  When  the ANC has recovered  to ≥ 1,500/mm3 and the fever  or infection  has resolved,  
the patient  may restart  treatment.  
 
Skin Toxicity 
With  panitumumab, various  degrees of skin toxicity,  specifically  rash and erythema  have been 
reported. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_763490].  If the rash were  
to develop to have small  acneiform  pustules, topi[INVESTIGATOR_763491]. The rash is self-limiting  and dissipates upon cessation  of the 
drug in the majority  of cases.  
 
It is recommended  patients  use suncscreen  and hats to limit sunexposure  while  on receiving  
panitumumab. 
 
Pulmonary Toxicity  
Panitumumab  may cause pulmonary fibrosis.  In case of unexplained respi[INVESTIGATOR_763492]-productive  cough, dyspnea, crackles,  or radiological  pulmonary infiltrates,  panitumumab  
should be discontinued until further pulmonary investigation. 
 
 
7.7. Supportive Therapy  
 
 
7.7.1. Diarrhea  
Loperamide:  All patients will be instructed  to begin taking loperamide  at the earliest  signs  of 
diarrhea  (i.e. first poorly formed  or loose stool, first epi[INVESTIGATOR_763493]) that occurs more  than 12 hours  after receiving  irinotecan. Loperamide  should be taken  
in the following  manner:  [ADDRESS_1046324] 12 hours. Patients  may take loperamide  4 mg every  4 hours  
during the night. 
Atropi[INVESTIGATOR_050]:  Diarrhea  or abdominal crampi[INVESTIGATOR_763494]  0.4 mg IM or Subq. Additional  antidiarrheal measures 
may be used at the discretion  of the treating  physician. Atropi[INVESTIGATOR_763495]

 patients  with  potential  contraindications  (e.g., obstructive uropathy, glaucoma, tachycardia,  etc.).  
 
7.7.2. Nausea  and Vomiting  
Antiemetics: Patients  should receive antiemetics prior to chemotherapy administration  according  
to institution  guidelines. 
 
7.7.3. Myelosuppresion  
Growth  Factors:  Routine prophylactic  use of a colony- stimulating  factor  (G-CSF or GM-CSF)  is 
not permitted.  Therapeutic  use in patients  with serious  neutropenic  complications  such as ANC  
of < 500 for more  than 5 days, fever  accompanying  grade  3-4 neutropenia, or obvious sepsis may 
be considered, at  the investigator's  discretion.  
Erythopoietin treatment  for moderate to severe anemia (< 10 mg/dl) is permitted  in the study.  
 
 
7.8. Concomitant Medications  and Treatments  
5-FU and some  of its metabolites  are converted principally  by [CONTACT_508631] (carboxylesterase 
and cytidine  deaminase and PyNPase  in tumor tissues).  At present,  it is unknown whether  this 
metabolism  is likely  to be influenced by [CONTACT_763535], which  either  induce  or 
inhibit certain  liver enzymes.  
Laxatives:  The use of drugs  with  laxative  properties  should be  avoided. 
 
7.9. Warnings  and Precautions  regarding  specific agents used  in this protocol  
 
7.9.1 5-Fluorouracil:  
 
Cardiovascular:  Although uncommon, fluorouracil  has been  associated  with chest  pain, anginal  
attacks,  ischemic electrocardiographic  changes,  myocardial  infarction, cardiomyopathy, and very 
rarely,  sudden death. Most  commonly, these  effects occur when  the drug is administered  as a 
continuous  infusion and within  several  hours  from  the start of the infusion. Patients  with pre- 
existing coronary artery  disease (CAD)  appear to be at greater risk; however, most reported  cases 
are in those with no previous history of CAD.  
 
Dermatologic:  Contact  [CONTACT_8748],  Alopecia,  dry skin,  fissuring, hand- foot syndrome, nail 
changes,  rash,  photosensitivity, and vein pi[INVESTIGATOR_763496]: primarily  neutropenia, occurred  significantly  more  often  in patients  
receiving  bolus injections (31%  versus  4%, RR 0.14, p less than 0.0001). Anemia  and 
thrombocytopenia  occurred  in less than 5% of all patients.  agranulocytosis, anemia,  epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940],  
pancytopenia, and thrombocytopenia  have also been reported  during treatment  with intravenous  
5-FU. Factors increasing  the risk for hematologic  toxicity  included a poor performance  status  
and fluorouracil  administration  by [CONTACT_238678],  while  increased  age, female  gender, and a 
good performance  status significantly  increased  the risk for nonhematologic  toxicities.  In hand- 
foot syndrome, continuous  administration  of fluorouracil was  an additional  prognostic  factor.  
 
Gastrointestinal: Commonly  occurring symptoms  during IV fluorouracil  therapy are stomatitis,  
esophagopharyngitis, nausea,  vomiting, anorexia and diarrhea

OSU PROTOCOL #: [ZIP_CODE]  VERSION: 09/19/2017  
IRB Approved:  tracked   
  
Neurologic:  Neurological  effects reported  with the administration  of fluorouracil include  
confusion, disorientation,  euphoria, nystagmus, headache,  and acute cerebellar  syndrome.  
 
7.9.2 Irinotecan:  
Bone  Marrow  Suppression: Virtually  all phase I and II studies  of irinotecan  have reported  
neutropenia  that may be dose limiting.  Anemia  and lymphocytopenia  have been  observed as 
well.  
GI: Diarrhea - abdominal  crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and diarrhea (early  diarrhea)  during or shortly  after 
irinotecan  administration; late diarrhea  (diarrhea  occurring more  than 8 hours  after irinotecan  
administration) as the dose-limiting  toxicities  (depending upon the schedule).  Other  commonly 
observed adverse events  include  nausea and vomiting, anorexia, abdominal  crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  Infrequent  
occurrences of mucositis  or colitis  (sometimes with gastrointestinal  bleeding)  have been  
observed. 
Skin: alopecia,  asthenia.  irinotecan  may cause  local  irritation  at infusion sites.  Extravasation  
necrosis of the skin has  not been  reported  in US  studies.  
Constitutional: Dehydration has occurred as a consequence  of diarrhea,  particularly  when  
associated  with severe  vomiting.  Patients  may have an acute syndrome  of lacrimation,  
diaphoresis, this syndrome is thought  to be cholinergically  mediated.  
Pulmonary:  Sporadic  cases of pulmonary toxicity,  manifested  as shortness  of breath,  
nonproductive cough, and transient  infiltrates  on chest X -ray have been reported. 
Renal:  Occasionally,  abnormalities  of serum  Creatinine have been observed. 
 
8. STUDY OUTCOME MEASURES  
 
8.1. Objective Response Rate  (ORR)  
Objective response of measurable disease will be in accordance with  the criteria described  in

9. SAFETY PARAMETERS  
 
9.1. Abnormal  Laboratory  Test Values  
In the event  of unexplained abnormal  laboratory test values,  the tests should be repeated  
immediately  and followed up until they have  returned to the normal  range  and/or  an adequate  
explanation of the abnormality  is found. 
 
9.2. Pregnancy  
The patient  will be removed from the study if she becomes pregnant  during the study and 
immediately  inform  the investigator. The investigator  should counsel  the patient,  and discuss the 
risk of continuing with the pregnancy and the possible effects on the fetus.  Monitoring of the 
patient  should continue until conclusion of the pregnancy.  
Pregnancy occurring in the partner  of a patient  participating  in the study must  also be treated  as 
described  above. 
 
9.3. Data Safety Monitoring and Submission:  
 
Data Safety Monitoring Plan 
The data and safety monitoring plan will involve the continuous evaluation of safety, data quality 
and data timeliness. Investigators will conduct continuous review of data and patient safety at their regular Disease Group meetings (at leas t monthly) and the discussion will be documented in the 
minutes. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_763497], where applicable, at these disease centered meetings and determine if the risk/benefit ratio of the trial changes. Frequ ency and severity of adverse events will be reviewed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_459678]/device from other sources, including published literature, scientific meetings and discussions with sponsors, to determine if the trial should be t erminated before 
completion. Serious adverse events and responses will be reviewed by [CONTACT_663051] (DSMC). The PI [INVESTIGATOR_37354] a progress report (biannually for Phase II and quarterly for Phase I) that will be reviewe d by [CONTACT_763536].  
 Mandatory safety and trial review teleconferences will be scheduled and moderated by [CONTACT_37377] -
Center Trial Program (MCTP). All sites involved in the study are expected to have a rep resentative 
present for every call to review and discuss patients on study and other applicable agenda items. Meeting minutes will be used to document each teleconference. The minutes will be stored in the MCTP protocol files.  
 
Data Submission  
 
The study will be managed per the Multi -Center Trial Program (MCTP) policies. Subsite data must 
be submitted to the MCTP within 2 weeks of completion of each cycle. Data will be submitted using case report forms and the Data Submission Form cover sheet (refer to Supplemental Forms Document) supplied by [CONTACT_763537]. Access to the OSU OnCore database may be provided to external participating sites for direct electronic data entry. All data submitted must be accompanied by [CONTACT_37413].

Adverse Events 
An adverse event is defined in the International  Conference on Harmonization (ICH)  Guideline  
for Good  Clinical Practice as “any  untoward medical  occurrence in a patient  or clinical 
investigation  subject  administered  a pharmaceutical  product and that does not necessarily  have  a 
causal  relationship  with this treatment.”  (ICH  E6:1.2). The ongoing review  of safety  data will 
include  review  of clinical  AEs and SAEs  including skin- related  toxicity  assessment  and 
laboratory  studies.  The CTCAE  version 4.0 will be used to grade  all AEs,  except  panitumumab - 
related  skin toxicity,  which  will be graded by [CONTACT_763538] 3.0 Dermatology Skin 
Assessment  (Appendix  4). The investigator  is responsible for reviewing  laboratory  test results  
and determining whether  an abnormal  value  in an individual  study subject  represents a change  
from  values  before  the study. In general,  abnormal  laboratory  findings  without  clinical  
significance (based  on the investigator's  judgment) should not be recorded  as adverse  events; 
however, laboratory  value changes  requiring  therapy or adjustment  in prior  therapy are 
considered  adverse events.  
 
Serious  Adverse Events 
A serious  adverse event (SAE)  is defined as an adverse event that:  
• Is fatal 
• Is life threatening (places the subject  at immediate  risk of death)  
• Requires  in-pa tient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10909]  
• Results in persistent  or significant  disability/incapacity  
• Is a congenital  anomaly/birth defect  
• Other significant  medical  hazard  
A hospi[INVESTIGATOR_763498] “serious” is any inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_763499]  a minimum  of an overnight  stay in a health  care facility.  Any adverse  
event  that does not meet  one of the definitions  of serious  (e.g. emergency  room  visit,  outpatient  
surgery, or requires  urgent investigation) may be considered  by [CONTACT_763539] 
“other  significant  medical  hazard”  criterion  for classification  as a serious adverse event. 
Examples  include allergic bronchospasm, convulsions, and blood dyscrasias.  
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_763500] -required  procedures  or administration  of study 
treatment  is not classified  as an  SAE.  
 
Reporting  Procedures for All Adverse Events  
All AEs occurring after informed  consent  signing observed by [CONTACT_98756]  (whether  or not attributed  to investigational  product)  will be reported  on the case report  
form.  The investigator  is responsible  for ensuring that all adverse events observed by [CONTACT_763540]’ medical  records.  
 
The following adverse event attributes  must be assigned  by [CONTACT_093]:  
• Adverse  event  diagnosis  or syndrome(s)  (if known, signs  or symptoms if  not known)  
• Event  d escription  (with  detail appropriate to the  event) 
• Dates of onset  and resolution  
• Severity  
• Assessment  of relatedness to study treatment  
• Action  taken.

It will be left to the investigator’s  clinical judgment to determine  whether  an adverse event  is 
related  and of sufficient  severity  to require  the subject’s removal  from treatment or from  the 
study. A subject  may also voluntarily withdraw  from  treatment  due to what  he or she perceives 
as an intolerable  adverse event. If either  of these situations  arises,  the subject  should be strongly 
encouraged to undergo an end-of-study assessment  and be under  medical  supervision until 
symptoms cease or the condition becomes stable.  
 
Serious  Adverse Events Reporting  Procedures  
Serious  adverse events will be collected  and recorded  at least throughout  the study period, 
beginning with the signing of the informed  consent through 30 days after the end of the treatment  
phase or through the safety  follow -up visit, whichever is longer. 
 
Subsite SAE reporting  requirements  are located  at the end of this section.  Subsites  are NOT  
permitted  to report  directly  to the  FDA,  [COMPANY_010], or the OSU IRB.  
 
The investigator  should notify the Sponsor ( John Hays , MD, PhD ) of all serious adverse events  
occurring at the site(s)  in accordance with FDA Regulations. The Sponsor will medically  review  
all SAEs.  The Sponsor will ensure  the notification  of the appropriate  Ethics  
Committees/Institutional Review  Boards, of all serious adverse  events  occurring at the site(s) in 
accordance with  FDA regulations. 
 
The s

 10. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
HYPOTHESIS  AND ENDPOINTS  
With  median  progression- free survival  (PFS)  as the primary  endpoint, the primary  objective of 
this single  arm, open- label,  phase  II study is to determine  the median  PFS for FOLFIRI  and 
panitumumab  in patients  with metastatic  RAS  wild-type colorectal  carcinoma  who have  
previously failed  FOLFIRI  and bevacizumab.  
The secondary endpoints  of this study  are the frequency and severity  of toxicities  of the regimens,  
overall  response rate, and overall  survival  rate at  1 year.  
 
10.1. Study design and Sample Size Calculation : 
The PRIME  study is a phase III clinical trial, in which  patients  with metastatic colorectal  cancer  
and KRAS  (codon 12 and 13) wild-type tumors  were  randomized to FOLFOX  or FOLFOX  and 
panitumumab  for first- line therapy. Retrospective analysis  of the additional  RAS  mutations  
showed  that patients  with tumors  that were  RAS  wild-type had a 2.2 month improvement  in PFS 
when  panitumumab  was added to FOLFOX  (7.9 vs. 10.1 months [HR 0.72m  95% CI 0.58- 0.90, 
p=0.004]) (43). Patients  receiving  FOLFIRI  plus panitumumab  after failing  first–line non- 
irinotecan  containing treatment  for RAS  wild-type metastatic colorectal  cancer  patients  had a 
reported  mPFS  of 5.9 months compared  to 3.9 months for those treated  with FOLFIRI  alone  
(36). Also,  per the BOND study, patients  who had disease progression on prior  irinotecan -based  
chemoregimens  were  randomized to either  cetuximab  monotherapy or cetuximab  and irinotecan.  
Median  time to progression was improved by 2.6 months with the combination arm (1.5 vs 4.1 
months, comparing cetuximab  vs cetuximab and irinotecan)  (34). We expect  a similar  treatment  
effect  for panitumumab  and FOLFIRI  in our study following  FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab  failure.  
As such, we expect  our group of patients  to have  an improved mPFS  (6 months) compared  to the 
his
torical control  of a similar patient  population treated  with irinotecan  and cetuximab  (3.98  
months) in RAS  wild -type metastatic colorectal  cancer  (36). 
 
We antic
ipate  a uniform accrual  rate of [ADDRESS_1046332] been set at 0.10 and 80% respectively  when  
calculating  the sample size using the online sample  size calculator  provided by [CONTACT_99944]  
(http://www.swogstat.org/statoolsout.html ). 
 
With  a total of [ADDRESS_1046333]  95% confidence intervals  no wider  than 
20% for proportions. If a specific adverse event  occurs  with a true probability of 10%, the 
probability of observing one  or more patients with the AE in 25 patients  will be about  93%. 
 
 
10.2. Analysis  of Primary  and Secondary  Efficacy  Parameters 
Continuous variables  will be expressed  by [CONTACT_3163],  standard  deviations  and 95% confidence  
intervals.  Frequencies will be computed for discrete data.  Median  PFS will be estimated  using 
the  Kaplan -Meier   estimator  with  confidence   interval   calculated   based  on  the  Brookmeyer - 
Crowley  method (38). Kaplan -Meier estimator will be  used also to estimate OS  rate at  1 year.

11. TISSUE COLLECTION AND CORRELATIVE ANALYSIS  
 
11.1 Tissue collection  only  applies  to patients  who  were  enrolled  during previous version of the 
protocol, when  only KRAS codon 12 and 13 were assessed  for enrollment eligibility.   Tissue is 
collected  so that additional RAS  mutations  can be assessed  retrospectively.   Thus, if  all RAS  
mutations  [KRAS  exon 2 (codon 12 and 13),exon 3 (codon 61) and exon 4 (codons  117 and 146) 
and NRAS  exon 2 (codons  12 and 13), exon 3 (codon 61), and exon 4 (codons 117 and 146)]  are 
checked  prior to trial enrollment, then no tissue collection  is needed. A new biopsy will is not  
required  strictly  for purposes of this correlative study.  Paraffin -embedded tissue will be obtained 
from  OSU Department  of Pathology via the Histology Core  Facility  as per  standard.  
 
Diagnostic samples shall be formalin -fixed  and paraffin -embedded according  to standard  
laboratory  procedures,  with the  purpose of storing  for future  analysis of additional RAS  
mutations  including:  KRAS  codon exon3 and [ADDRESS_1046334]  laboratory  protocol and supplies  
(e.g. formalin,  ethanol, paraffin,  tissue cassettes,  etc) to perform the paraffin -embedding. For 
surgical  specimens,  we will defer to handling of the specimen  as per the institutional standard  
practice of grossing the specimen  and preparing it for Surgical  Pathology evaluation (e.g. 
surgical  margins, histology, lymph node, etc.).  
 
11.2 SP
ECIMEN SUBMISSION  
 
11.2.1 If the recommended  blocks  cannot  be released  to OSU for correlative research,  we ask  
that unstained slides are required  to be  cut as outlined:  
 
1-Tissue Sections diameter >5  mm, include five  sections, 10 um in thickness.  
 
2-Tissue sections diameter< 5mm square, include  15-20 sections 10um in thickness.  
3- Please use NON- PLUS  slides and  one H&E  (2-4um) for each block. 
For these molecular  studies,  multiple tissue  sections can be collected  on one  glass slide,  as the tissue 
itself  is digested  and scraped  off the slide,  thus there  is not a need to mount  one section  per slide.  The 
slides will be air dried (not  oven- dried). The slides  will be stored at room  temperature  (>16°C).

 Appendix  4: Panitumumab  Pharmacy  Guide  
Packaging, Formulation,  Labeling  and Storage  
Panitumumab  will be manufactured and packaged  by [CONTACT_763544]’s  clinical  trial drug distribution  procedures. Each  vial of panitumumab will 
contain 10 mL  of a sterile  protein  solution containing a 20- mg/mL  solution of 
panitumumab.  The vial  will contain approximately [ADDRESS_1046341] be stored at 2-8° C in a  secured  area upon receipt.  
As panitumumab contains  no preservatives,  vials  are designed  for single use only. 
Exposure of the material  to excessive temperature above or below this range  should be 
avoided.  Do  not allow panitumumab to freeze and do not use if contents  freeze in transit 
or in storage.  If vials fall out of specified  temperature requirement,  please  contact  
[CONTACT_763525]. 
Records  of the actual  storage  condition during the period of the study must be  maintained  
(ie, records  of the date and time and initials  of person checking, and the “working day” 
temperature of the refrigerator used  for storage of trial supplies, continuous  temperature  
recordings, or regularly  maintained  temperature alarm  systems used  in conjunction with 
temperature recording).  
 
 
Preparation  
NOTE: Panitumumab  is a protein  and should be handled gently  to avoid  foaming, 
which may lead to denaturation  of the protein  product.   This precaution  applies  not 
only to  panitumumab stored  in the vial, but also for diluted  panitumumab  prepared  
in the IV bag.  It is, therefore,  essential  to avoid medication  delivery  methods,  
particularly  pneumatic  tube systems,  that could potentially  lead  to excessive shaking  
or vibration  that would lead to particulate formation in the protein  product.  
Panitumumab  must  be prepared  as an  intravenous  infusion using aseptic techniques.  The  
dose of panitumumab  will be 6 mg/kg  and will be based  upon the subject’s baseline 
weight. The dose of panitumumab is required  to be  recalculated  only when  the subject’s 
body weight  increases or decreases by  > 10% from  the original screening/baseline 
weight.  This  weight  will be considered  the new baseline weight  from  which a + 10% 
variance is allowed  before another  recalculation  is necessary.   The  calculated  amount  of 
panitumumab  (may  be rounded to the nearest  ten milligrams  [eg, 456 mg rounded to 460 
mg or 312 mg rounded to 310 mg]) will be removed  from the vials and added to a 
minimum volume  of 100 mL of pyrogen- free 0.9% sodium chloride solution USP.  The 
maximum concentration of the diluted  solution to  be infused should not exceed  10 
mg/mL.   In the event a subject’s  actual  body weight  requires  greater than a 150- mL 
volume infusion, panitumumab will be administered  over 60 to 90 + 15 minutes, as 
tolerated.  (6 milligrams/kilogram  (mg/kg) intra venously infused over 60 minutes  every  
14 days. Infuse doses higher than 1000 mg  over 90 minutes. Do not give panitumumab as 
IV bolus. Add doses  of up to 1000 mg to a 100 mL bag of 0.9% NS. For doses  greater

 than 1000 mg, dilute  in a 150 mL  bag of 0.9% NS. Mix  diluted solution by [CONTACT_763545]. Do  not shake.  Administer with  a low protein -binding 0.[ADDRESS_1046342] operating 
procedures. 
 
 
Supply  and Return  
At study initiation  and as needed  thereafter,  panitumumab will  be shipped to a 
responsible person (eg, a pharmacist) at  the Investigator’s  institution, who  will check  the 
amount  and condition of the drug and enter  these  data into the  Proof of Receipt  Form  and 
Investigational Product  Accountability  record.  The  Proof of  Receipt  Form  should then  be 
returned   to[COMPANY_010], and the original  retained  at the site. At the end of the study, or as 
directed,  all panitumumab supplies, including unused, partially used, or empty  containers,  
will be destroyed at  the site or returned  to [COMPANY_010] as directed.  
 
 
Panitumumab Accountability  
An Investigational  Product  Accountability Record  for the must be  kept current and 
should contain:  
• The dates and quantities of panitumumab  received  
• Manufacturing  batch  or lot numbers  for product  received  
• Subject’s identification  (subject  number)  
• Date and quantity  of panitumumab dispensed  (and remaining, if from individual  subject  drug 
units) 
• The initials of th e dispenser  
• Dose preparation  records  
• Date and quantity  of drug returned  to the  investigator/pharmacy,  if appropriate  
 
Any discrepancies must be  documented and subsequently reported  immediately.  
These inventories  must  be made  available  for inspection  by [CONTACT_763546](s)  
and regulatory  agency  inspector(s).  The investigator is responsible  for the accountability  of all 
used and unused trial supplies.

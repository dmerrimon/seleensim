If the purpose of this submission is to establish a research repository describe the informed consent process. For guidance
regarding consent issues, process approaches, and sample language see the Sample Repository/Registry/Bank Consent
Template .
Once a subject is referred for consideration in the study, the subject’s history and status will be completely evaluated and treatment
recommendations will then be discussed thoroughly with the subject. Any alternative forms of therapy will be presented as objectively
as possible. The risks and hazards of the study drugs recommended will be explained to the subject. The Investigator shall seek
consent only under circumstances that provide the subject sufficient opportunity to consider whether or not to participate and that
minimize the possibility of coercion or undue influence. The subject will be given as much time as needed to review the consent and
ask any questions before making a decision. The subject will then receive a signed copy of the consent form.
Requests for information about the research or complaints will be addressed to the PI, research staff, Ombudsman or Office of
Research Integrity as appropriate. All requests or complaints will be handled in a timely, courteous, and confidential manner following
University policies.

e) If the research involves using or accessing identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens, the research could
not practicably be carried out without using such information or biospecimens in an identifiable format.
Private information/specimens are “identifiable” if the investigator may ascertain the identity of the subject or if identifiers
are associated with the information (e.g., medical records). This could be any of the 18 HIPAA identifiers  including dates
of service .
If not using identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens, insert N/A below.
Section [ADDRESS_203855] fit into one of three regulatory options :
1. The only record linking the participant and the research would be the consent document, and the principal risk would be
potential harm resulting from a breach of confidentiality (e.g., a study that involves participants who use illegal drugs).
2. The research presents no more than minimal risk to the participant and involves no procedures for which written consent
is normally required outside of the research context (e.g., a cover letter on a survey, or a phone script).
3. The participant (or legally authorized representative) is a member of a distinct cultural group or community in which
signing forms is not the norm, the research presents no more than minimal risk to the subject, and there is an appropriate
alternative mechanism for documenting that informed consent was obtained.
Select the option below that best fits your study. 
If the IRB approves a waiver of signatures, participants must still be provided oral or written information about the study.
To ensure you include required elements in your consent document, use the Cover Letter Template  as a guide. There is
an English  and a Spanish  version.
 
Option 1
Describe how your study meets these criteria:
a) The only record linking the participant and the research would be the consent document:
b) The principal risk would be potential harm resulting from a breach of confidentiality (i.e., a study that involves subjects
who use illegal drugs).
Under this option, each participant (or legally authorized representative) must be asked whether (s)he wants to sign a
consent document; if the participant agrees to sign a consent document, only an IRB approved version should be
used.
Option 2
Describe how your study meets these criteria:
a) The research presents no more than minimal risk to the participant:
b) Involves no procedures for which written consent is normally required outside of the research context (i.e. a cover
letter on a survey, or a phone script):
Option 3
Describe how your study meets these criteria:
a) The subject (or legally authorized representative) is a member of a distinct cultural group or community in which
signing forms is not the norm.
b) The research presents no more than minimal risk to the subject.
c) There is an appropriate alternative mechanism for documenting that informed consent was obtained.

Neuroendocrine tumors vary widely in both disease site and grade, ranging from low grade, relatively benign carcinoid tumors to
aggressive and rapi[INVESTIGATOR_174558]-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas. High grade neuroendocrine carcinomas (HG-NECs) can originate
anywhere in the body, and are highly aggressive, with dismal 5-year overall survival rates. The lung and gastrointestinal tract (small
bowel, colon, rectum or pancreas) form the majority of these HG-NECs sites. HG-NECs are classified into three subtypes based on
histopathology, specifically, as small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma, large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) or poorly
differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma. 
There is a lack of consensus for upfront systemic regimens for HG-NECs and as such, treatment is often per physician preference.
Most often, HG-NECs are treated with platinum-based chemotherapeutic regimens, with marked heterogeneity in response. It is well
established that small cell neuroendocrine carcinomas are characterized by a co-mutation for TP53 and RB1, and are exceptionally
platinum-sensitive. However less is known about LCNECs. 
Large-Cell Neuroendocrine Carcinoma
LCNEC was first introduced in 1991 by [CONTACT_174576]. al [5] as a new type of lung cancer. The [ADDRESS_203856] clinicopathological identity
[6-8]. Histopathologically, these tumors are characterized by [CONTACT_174577] (more than 10 mitosis per high power field), extensive
necrosis, and neuroendocrine features, specifically the presence of chromogranin A, neuron specific enolase and synaptophysin.
LCNEC is a rare and aggressive disease with a paucity of data regarding disease progression. Precise incidence and prevalence is
unknown. From 2003-2012, the Dutch Cancer Registry reported 952 histologically confirmed new cases of pulmonary LCNECs.
Among these cases, 383 patients presented with advanced disease, primarily metastases to liver, bone or brain. The prognosis is
poor with overall 5-year survival for metastatic disease less than 5% , which is similar to small cell lung cancer (SCLC), although some
studies suggest that the prognosis for early stage LCNEC might be slightly better and similar to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). 
Molecular Profiling of HG-NECs
Molecular profiling of small-cell neuroendocrine carcinomas is well established and validated, indicating universally expressed co-
mutation for TP53 and RB1 [2]. Recently there have been attempts to define genomic profiles of LCNEC. The development of a 241-
gene panel on pulmonary tumors, next generation sequencing allows LCNECs to be further defined. 
Based on specific genetic signatures, Rekhtman and colleagues sub-classified 45 LCNECs into two major cohorts: 
small cell-like (TP53/RB1 co-mutated; n=18) and 
non-small cell-like (n=25), 
as well as one minor cohort (carcinoid-like n=2). 
Similarly, molecular profiling of gastrointestinal high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas (GI-NECs) indicate that they can also be
dichotomously categorized by [CONTACT_174578]-mutations for TP53 and RB1. 
Treatment regimens for small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma are well established, based on clinical trials conducted in SCLC. In
contrast, current guidelines regarding optimal treatment for large-cell and poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas are
nonexistent, driven by [CONTACT_174579]. Additionally, the WHO recently defined a new subtype
of high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma, mixed neuroendocrine neoplasm (MINEN), which features characteristics found in large-cell
carcinomas and in other tumor types, including adenocarcinomas for example. 
To date, there are no prospective randomized clinical trials examining front line therapi[INVESTIGATOR_174559]-NECs, based on mutational
profiles. Given the gap in evidence-based information for treatment and the emerging more refined classification of these tumors, we
propose to utilize recent genomic profiles of high-grade large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas to guide and inform clinicians of optimal
treatments. 
We hypothesize that upfront genetic profiling of HG-NEC can segregate these tumors into NGS-based groups that will impact
Section 9 Page 1 of 859128
treatment decisions (feasibility study) and ultimately, improve overall treatment response and outcomes.
Objectives
List your research objectives. Please include a summary of intended research objectives in the box below.
Primary Objective 
To study the feasibility of upfront next generation sequencing (NGS) directed treatment in high grade neuroendocrine carcinomas
(excluding small cell carcinoma). Feasibility is defined as being able to sequence the patient within 2 months of initial medical oncology
visit and more than 50% of patients are assigned to molecularly defined cohorts (TP53 and RB1 co-mutated vs. non-co-mutated).
Secondary Objectives:
To evaluate progression-free survival on front-line chemotherapy.
To evaluate the objective response rate.
Exploratory Objective: To identify prevalence of potentially targetable mutations in high grade neuroendocrine carcinoma
Study Design
Describe and explain the study design (e.g., observational, secondary analysis, single/double blind, parallel, crossover, deception, etc.).
Clinical Research : Indicate whether subjects will be randomized and whether subjects will receive any placebo.
Community-Based Participatory Research : If you are conducting community-based participatory research (CBPR) , describe
strategies for involvement of community members in the design and implementation of the study, and dissemination of results from
the study.
Qualitative research : Indicate ranges where flexibility is needed, if a fixed interview transcript is not available, describe interview
topi[INVESTIGATOR_41866].
Research Repositories : If the purpose of this submission is to establish a Research Repository (bank, registry) and the material
you plan to collect is already available from a commercial supplier, clinical lab, or established IRB approved research repository,
provide scientific justification for establishing an additional repository collecting duplicate material. Describe the repository design
and operating procedures. For relevant information to include, see the [LOCATION_006] Research Biospecimen Bank Guidance  or the [LOCATION_006]
Research Registry Guidance .
This is a single-arm, pi[INVESTIGATOR_174560] (HG-LCNEC) to study the
feasibility of upfront NGS directed treatment in high grade neuroendocrine carcinomas. Tumor samples will receive next generation
sequencing (NGS) profiling to classify the tumor as one of three subtypes: small cell-like, non-small cell-like or non-typeable. Non-
typeable cases will not be eligible for participation in this study, neither is small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (HG-SCNEC). The
systemic therapy regimen will be determined based on the NGS profile of the tumor. 
Feasibility is defined as being able to sequence the patient within 2 months of initial medical oncology visit and being able to assign
into molecularly-defined cohorts (TP53 and RB1 co-mutated vs non-co-mutated). 
Secondary outcomes include ORR and progression-free survival (PFS). Radiological response will be assessed via RECIST Version
1.1 criteria (Appendix B) based on standard-of-care CT scans completed at q2 monthly intervals during treatment and q3 month during
observation. PFS is defined from date of on study to the date of disease progression or death or date of last follow-up whichever
occurs first. PFS will be assessed via standard-of-care CT scans (q2 month intervals during active treatment and q3 months during
observation) as graded by [CONTACT_150114] 1.[ADDRESS_203857] one epi[INVESTIGATOR_174561], the incidence of AE causing withdrawal from the
study and incidence of SAE. The total number of epi[INVESTIGATOR_174562] (Frequency Table), the severity and attribution to
study therapy of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_174563] (Severity Table and Attribution Table) will also be evaluated.
Subjects receive treatment on the recommended regimens for as long as the treating oncologist feels they are benefiting from the
treatment, and the patient wishes to continue. Subjects will be followed until disease progression.

Differentiate between procedures that involve standard/routine clinical care and those that will be performed specifically for this
research project. List medications that are explicitly forbidden or permitted during study participation.
Prior to any study-required tests, subjects must provide written informed consent to participate in this study. It is now standard of care
to send tumor tissue for molecular testing so subjects may begin standard of care (SOC) treatment while waiting for results from this
test. Patients can receive up to two cycles of Standard of Care (SOC) chemotherapy while NGS results are being obtained before the
patient can be presented at Markey Molecular Tumor Board (MTB). Based on the results, subjects may then be changed to a different,
FDA-approved treatment which matches the molecular patterns. All study visits, labs, tests and procedures are SOC and would be
done if the subject were not on study. 
Screening shall include: complete history; physical examination and evaluation of ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group)
Performance Status; histopathological confirmed diagnosis of high grade neuroendocrine carcinoma; CBC; serum chemistries and
baseline computerized tomographic (CT) scan (within 6 weeks of starting treatment) for RECIST 1.1 evaluation. Baseline lab tests and
radio-graphic studies should be completed within 6 weeks prior to registration/initiation of treatment. All of these are standard of care
for metastatic carcinoma of HG-NEC type. 
The case will be reviewed at MTB once the NGS report is ready, patient meets inclusion criteria and has consented to participate in the
study. The MTB will provide a written review of the molecular sequencing of the subject, and the study statistician will review and assign
subjects to cohorts, in consultation with the PI. Subjects will be assigned to the current FDA-approved, NCCN-recommended
treatment regimen based on their molecular profile and will continue treatment for as long as the risk-benefit profile remains favorable,
the study remains active, and they wish to continue. 
All the procedures to be carried out are illustrated in the attached study calendar. All the tests/procedures are standard of care for this
patient population.

Potential Risks & Benefits
Risks
Describe any potential risks – including physical, psychological, social, legal, ability to re-identify subjects, or other risks. Assess
the seriousness and likelihood of each risk.
Which risks may affect a subject’s willingness to participate in the study?
Describe likely adverse effects of drugs, biologics, devices or procedures participants may encounter while in the study.
Qualitative research  - describe ethical issues that could arise while conducting research in the field and strategies you may use to
handle those situations.
Describe any steps to mitigate these risks.
Benefits
Describe potential direct benefits to study participants – including diagnostic or therapeutic, physical, psychological or emotional,
learning benefits. This cannot include incentives or payments.
State if there are no direct benefits.
Describe potential benefits to society and/or general knowledge to be gained.
Describe why potential benefits are reasonable in relation to potential risks. If applicable, justify why risks to vulnerable subjects are
reasonable to potential benefits.
Tumor tissue collected will be left-over from SOC biopsies. Risks of blood draw include soreness, bruising, pain, infection, possible
fainting, bleeding. 
Risks of having genetic testing for this study relate to accidental breach of confidence and would include emotional, social, or financial
consequences. In some cases, it could be used to make it harder for the subject to get or keep a job or health insurance. Genetic
information could be used in ways that could cause the subject or their family distress. We will take every precaution to protect our
subjects' information.
HG-NEC is an aggressive cancer with poor prognosis. At the time of this study, overall 5-year survival for metastatic disease is less
than [ADDRESS_203859] front-line treatment. Physician mainly treat with platinum based chemotherapy with
markedly uneven results. The treatment plan matched specifically to the subjects' molecular profile should be more effective than the
usual treatment approach. As all therapi[INVESTIGATOR_174566]-approved treatments for that molecular pattern, we
feel the risk-benefit ratio is acceptable.
Available Alternative Opportunities/Treatments
Describe alternative treatments or opportunities that might be available to those who choose not to participate in the study, and which
offer the subject equal or greater advantages. If applicable, this should include a discussion of the current standard of care treatment(s).
Subjects can get the usual treatment for this type of cancer without being on study. They can participate in another study, if one is
available. They can receive only palliative care or refuse all treatment.

Digital Data
Specimens from subjects (either archival or fresh tumor tissue) are reviewed for NGS status for participation in the study.
Medical/Clinical information pertaining to the protocol is included in the subjects’ medical records. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_174567]’
protocol charts. This ensures timely record review, and allows for collection of data points required to meet primary and secondary
objectives of the study.
Confidentiality of medical information is discussed at length in the informed consent. Subjects are made aware of what data will be
collected, where it is stored and who has access to the information. Study data may be published or shared with other researchers, but
the identity and medical history of each study participant will remain strictly confidential. Representatives of University of Kentucky,
Markey Cancer Center, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Kentucky Cancer Registry, and the Institutional Review Board
(IRB) may review the study data and medical records relating to this research study. 
During the study, information will be collected to assess compliance with the study requirements. These records will be used by [CONTACT_174581]. The records will not be used for any
other purposes or disclosed to any other party without the subject’s permission. All records will be coded with an identification number
to protect their identity. Data will be stored in a secured area for at least six years or two years after the study is completed, whichever
occurs first. All data stored is on site at Markey Cancer Center Clinical Research Organization in locked facilities, and with limited
access to records by [CONTACT_174582]. All research records will be held for a minimum of six years following completion of
the study.
Patients enrolled in this study will be evaluated clinically and with standard laboratory tests before and at regular intervals during their
participation in this study. Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_31029], ECGs, clinical chemistry and hematology tests and
monitoring of adverse events. Adverse events that occur between the signing of the informed consent through [ADDRESS_203860] be retained for a minimum of 6 years after study closure. Do
you confirm that you will retain all IRB-related records for a minimum of 6 years after study closure?
Yes No
Payment
Describe the incentives (monetary or other) being offered to subjects for their participation. If monetary compensation is offered,
indicate the amount and describe the terms and schedule of payment. Please review this guidance  for more information on payments to
subjects, including restrictions and expectations.
Subjects will not receive any payment for participating in this study.
Costs to Subjects
Include a list of services and/or tests that will not be paid for by [CONTACT_23638]/or the study (e.g., MRI, HIV). Keep in mind that a
subject will not know what is “standard” – and thus not covered by [CONTACT_456]/study – unless you tell them.
All tests, visits, and procedures are standard of care for this patient population and will be billed to the subject's insurance. All drugs
recommended will be FDA-approved for the tumor markers and the drugs will be charged to the subject's insurance.
Data and Safety Monitoring
The IRB requires review and approval of data and safety monitoring plans for greater than minimal risk research or NIH-funded/FDA-
regulated clinical investigations.
If you are conducting greater than minimal risk research, or your clinical investigation is NIH-funded, describe your Data and Safety
Monitoring Plan (DSMP). Click here for additional guidance on developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a Data and Safety Monitoring Plan .
If this is a non-sponsored investigator-initiated protocol considered greater than minimal risk research, and if you are planning on
using a Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) as part of your DSMP, click here for additional guidance  for information to
include with your IRB application.
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_174568]. Additionally, the Markey Cancer
Center Data Safety and Monitoring Committee outlines oversight and monitoring of all cancer clinical trials. The Committee is
responsible for reviewing data to identify patient safety and protocol compliance issues. The Markey Protocol Review Committee
(PRC) assigns studies a DSMC review timeline based on the phase, origination of the study and known safety issues.
The members of the MCC DSMC consist of Medical Oncologists, a Pharmacist, a Nurse Manager, a Certified Clinical Research
Professional and a Reporter. These members were selected based on their experience, reputation for objectivity, and knowledge of
Section 9 Page 6 of 859128
clinical trial methodology. The DSMC reviews the protocol to assure the following: progress of the trial and safety of participants;
compliance with requirements for the reporting of adverse events; any actions resulting in a temporary or permanent suspension by [CONTACT_130376]; and data accuracy and protocol compliance. The DSMC, the Protocol Review Committee (PRC), the responsible disease-
specific Clinical Care and Research Team (CCART) and/or the [LOCATION_006] IRB are empowered to immediately suspend accrual to any study
under its purview for failure to comply with AE/SAE reporting requirements, poor study enrollment, protocol violations or issues related
to patient safety.

6. STUDY DESIGN AND STATISTICAL  CONSIDERATIONS  
 
6.1 Study Design and Endpoints  
 
This is a single -arm, pi[INVESTIGATOR_174570] (HG -LCNEC) to study the feasibility of upfront NGS directed treatment in high grade 
neuroendocrine carcinomas. Tumor samples will receive next generation sequencing (NGS) 
profiling to classify the tumor as: small cell -like or non- small cell-like. Non- typeable cases will 
not be eligible for participation in this study, neither is small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma  
(HG-SCNEC). The systemic therapy regimen will be determined based on the NGS profile of 
the tumor. 
 
Feasibility is defined as being able to sequence the patient within 2 months of initial medical oncology visit and being able to assign into molecularly -defined cohorts (TP53 and RB1 co- 
mutated vs non- co-mutated).  
 
Secondary outcomes include ORR and pro gression -free survival (PFS). Radiological response 
will be assessed via RECIST Version 1.1 criteria (Appendix B) based on standard- of-care CT 
scans completed at q2 monthly intervals during treatment and q3 month during observation. PFS is defined from date of on study to the date of disease progression or death or date of last follow- up whichever occurs first. PFS will be assessed via standard -of-care CT scans (q2 month 
intervals during active treatment and q3 months during observation) as graded by [CONTACT_174583] T 
Version 1.[ADDRESS_203861] one 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_174561], the incidence of AE causing withdrawal from the study and incidence of SAE. The total number of epi[INVESTIGATOR_174562] (Frequency Table), the severity and attribution to study therapy of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_174563] (Severity Table and Attribution Table) will also be evaluated.  
 
Listings of AEs by [CONTACT_174584]: time to onset, the duration of each AE, the severity of each AE, the relationship of the AE to study therapy, whether it was a serious AE (or not), and whether the AE caused withdrawal. Toxicities will be graded according to Common Toxicity Criteria (CTCAE) v5.  
 
6.2 Sample Size/Accrual  Rate  
 
We plan to enroll 15 patients on this pi[INVESTIGATOR_174571]- free 
survival. 
 
Feasibility is defined as being able to sequence the patient within 2 months of initial medical oncology visit and being able to assign into molecularly defined cohorts (TP53 and RB1 co- mutated vs non co-mutated). If more than 50% patients are not able to sequence within 2 months 
MCC Protocol #:  MCC -20-MULTI -37 
Version Date: 25.November.2020  
19 PRECISION -NEC   
  
of initial medical oncology visit or more than 50% patients are not able to assign into 
molecularly def ined cohorts, the study will be deemed not feasible. No stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_174572]. With 15 patients, the probability of unfeasible of the study is calculated with true unfeasibility probability p from 0.2 to 0.8 (Table 1). From this calculation we see if the true unfeasibility rate <0.5, the probability to declaim the trial unfeasible is low and if the true unfeasibility rate >0.5, the probability to declaim the trial unfeasible is high.

Patients who fail to complete 2 -cycles of the treatment due to toxicity or withdrawal from study 
will be excluded  f rom the ORR evaluation. All patients enrolled on the study will be evaluable 
for the PFS.  
 
6.3 Study  Cohorts 
 
Patients with large cell, HG -NEC will be enrolled into one of two cohorts, small cell-like or non- 
small cell-like cohorts, based on the next generation sequencing panel performed on the tumor sample. It is expected to enroll 6 patients for small cell-like subtype (40%) and 9 patients for non-small cell-like subtype (60%). 
 
6.[ADDRESS_203863] error (SE). All patients will be followed until disease progression, death or end of study,  whichever occurs first, for evaluation of PFS. The PFS will be estimated using Kaplan- 
Meier method for the entire cohort. Summary statistics will be provided for the analysis of potentially targetable mutations in high grade neuroendocrine carcinoma.

KEY INFORMATION FOR MCC -20-MULTI -37: A Pi[INVESTIGATOR_174574] -based stratification of front -line treatment of high -grade N euroendocrine 
Carcinoma (Precision -NEC) 
 
We are asking you to choose whether or not to volunteer for  a research study about using molecular analysis to 
guide treatment planning for patients with high- grade neuroendocrine cancer (HG -NEC). We are asking you to 
take part in this research because you have HG -NEC that has spread to other places in your body and your 
cancer cannot be cured by [CONTACT_44850]. T he purpose of this study is to use results of molecular analysis of your tumor 
tissue to inform treatment planning for your disease. 
 
This top sheet  provides K ey Information to help you decide whether to participate.  More detailed information is 
provided after this page. Ask the research team questions. If you have questions later, contact [CONTACT_38429]. 
Charles Kunos , MD, the researcher (i.e., Investigator ) in charge of th is study , can be found below.   
WHAT IS THE STUDY AB OUT AND HOW LONG WIL L IT LAST?   
HG-NEC is an aggressive cancer and currently, there is no standard f ront-line treatment. The usual approach  
involves  treatment  with platinum -based chemotherapy . For some patients this works well but for many others it 
does not. Among patients who g et the usual approach, about [ADDRESS_203864] 
the match of your tumor tissue’s mutation patterns to the mutation patterns found in other cancer types . We will 
then recommend the FDA -approved treatment for you based on your tumor mutations profile. We hope this 
molecularly -guided plan for treatment will be more effective against  your cancer (high- grade neuroendocrine 
cancer) than just the usual approach using platinum -based chemotherapy.  
Of course, getting the tumor analysis done and reviewing treatment options takes time. By [CONTACT_174585], we hope to find out if we can complete molecular analysis ( sequencing)  and begin your treatment in a 
timely manner. Additionally, w e want to learn how effective this approach will be. Your participation in this 
resear ch study  will last about 3 years.   
WHAT ARE KEY REASONS  YOU MIGHT CHOOSE TO VOLUNTEER FOR THIS STUDY?  
The treatment plan matched specifically for you should be more effective than the usual treatment approach you 
might otherwise receive, however , there may be no added benefit to you at all. For a complete description of 
benefits, refer to the Detailed Consent , found on the following pages . 
WHAT ARE KEY REASONS  YOU MIGHT CHOOSE NOT TO VOLUNTEER FOR T HIS STUDY?  
Next generation m olecular sequencing is now standard of care for all patients with HG -NEC and you can get 
treatment for your cancer without being on th is study . For a complete description of risks, refer to the Detailed 
Consent and/or  Appendix . 
DO YOU HAVE TO TAKE PART IN THE STUDY?  
If you decide to take part in the study, it should be because you really want to volunteer. You will not lose any 
services, benefits or rights you would normally have if you choose not to volunteer  to be in this study .  
WHAT IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS, SUGGESTIONS OR CONCERNS?  
If you have questions, suggestions, or concerns regarding this study or you want to withdraw from the study

Consent -HIPAA dated 2/13/2023    DETAILED CONSENT:  
ARE THERE REASONS WHY YOU WOULD NOT QUALIFY FOR THIS STUDY?  
You cannot be in this study if you are under [ADDRESS_203865] AND WHAT IS THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF TIME INVOLVED?  
The research procedures will be conducted at [LOCATION_006] Medical Center.  You will need to come to the clinic  every 4 
weeks while you are getting treatment.  You will get treatment as long as the treatment helps you and you want to 
continue. You will come to clinic for another visit 30 days after you finish treatment. Each of these visits will take 
about 2 hours. You will be in the study for about 3 years.  
WHAT WILL YOU BE ASKE D TO  DO?  
If you decide to take part in this study, while you are receiving the commonly -used, platinum -based 
chemotherapy, your tumor tissue will be sent to a laboratory for molecular sequencing. Those results will be 
analyzed by t he Markey Cancer Center Molecular Tumor Board and results  will be provided to your oncologist . 
Based on your cancer’s molecular profile y ou may then be changed to a different  FDA-approved treatment  
regimen that best matches the patterns of your tumor’s mutations . 
You will get the FDA -approved treatment for your cancer based on your tumor’s molecular profile. While on 
treatment , you will come to the clinic every [ADDRESS_203866] a physical exam and laboratory tests  (e.g., blood tests) . You will get a CT scan every [ADDRESS_203867] of all tests and procedures for this study, see the Appendix: 
Study Visits/Procedures.   
WHAT ARE THE POSSIBLE RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS?  
Physical : 
You will not receive any investigational treatment on this study.  
There is no additional physical risk from collecting leftover tumor tissue from a procedure that is being done as 
part of your clinical care.   
Risks of blood collection:  
Risks associated with blood sampling are generally slight, but may include soreness, bruising, pain, infection, possible fainting, bleeding.  
Risk of having genetic testing:  
Even without your name [CONTACT_174595], genetic information is unique to you making it possible for someone to trace it back to you. The results of genetic research apply to both you and your family members.  In some cases, 
it could be used to make it harder for you to get or keep a job or health insurance.  Genetic  information could be 
used in ways that could cause you or your family distress.  There is a f ederal law called the Genetic Information 
Non- discrimination Act (GINA).  Generally, GINA makes it illegal for health insurance companies, group health 
plans, and most employers to discriminate against you or treat you differently based on your genetic information. Be aware that GINA does not protect you against discrimination by [CONTACT_55173], disability insurance, or long- term care insurance.  GINA  also does not prohibit discrimination on the basis of an already 
known genetic disease.  
Unknown Risks  
In addition to the risks listed above, you may experience a previously unknown risk or  side effect. Tell the study 
doctor or study staff right away if you have any problems or ill effects from participating in this study.  The [ZIP_CODE]

part, you will be informed in a timely manner.  
WILL YOU BENEFIT FROM TAKING PART IN THIS STUDY?  
We do not know if you will get any benefit from taking part in this study. However, if you take part in this study, 
information learned may help others with your condition.  
IF YOU DON’T WANT TO TAKE PART IN THE STUDY, ARE THERE OTHER CHOICES?  
If you do not want to take part in the study, there are other choices .  
• You may choose to have cancer treatment without being on study.  At [LOCATION_006], our standard treatment would 
be platinum -based chemotherapy with carboplatin and etoposide.  
• You may choose to take part in a different research study, if one is available.  
• You may choose not to be treated for cancer.  
• You may choose to only get comfort care to help relieve your symptoms and not get treated for your cancer.   
WHAT WILL IT COST YOU TO PARTICIPATE? 
You and/or your insurance company, Medicare, or Medicaid will be responsible for the costs of all care and 
treatment that you would normally receive for any conditions you may have. These are costs that are considered 
medically necessary and will be part of the care you receive, even if you do not take part in this study.  
The University of Kentucky may not be allowed to bill your insurance company, Medicare, or Medicaid for the 
medical procedures done strictly for research. These costs will be paid by [CONTACT_174587]. The research- related tests/procedures for  this study are: review by [CONTACT_174588].  
WHO WILL SEE THE INFORMATION THAT YOU GIVE?  
When we write about or share the results from the study, we will write about the combined information. We will 
keep your name [CONTACT_56556].  We will make every effort to prevent anyone who is not 
on the research team from knowing that you gave us information, and what that information is.  Your  information 
will be stored in a password- protected database and any physical files (scans, slides or paper records ) will be 
stored in locked file cabinets located behind locked doors.   
You should know that in some cases  we may have to show your information to other people. For example, the law 
may require us to share your information with:  
• a court or  agencies, if you have a reportable disease/condition;  
• authorities, if you report information about a child being abused; or if you pose a danger to yourself or 
someone else.  
To ensure the study Is conducted properly, officials  of the National Cancer  Institute, the Kentucky Cancer 
Registry  and/or  the University  of Kentucky  may look at or copy pertinent  portions  of records  that identify  you. 
CAN YOU CHOOSE TO WITHDRAW FROM THE STUDY EARLY ?
 
You can choose to leave the study at any time. You will not be treated differently if you decide to stop taking part in the study.  
If you choose to leave the study early, data collected until that point will remain in the study database and may not 
be removed.  
The i nvestigators (researchers overseeing this trial)  may need to remove you from the study . You may be 
removed if:  
• you are not able to follow the directions ,

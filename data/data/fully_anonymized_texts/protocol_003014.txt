 INTRODUCTION  
Due to advances in maternal and fetal healthcare and the expansion of civil rights, between 100,000 and 
200,000 American women with physical disabilities (WWPD) are  pregnant each year.[ADDRESS_280968] tripled since 2000,2 with comparable rates of live births as their peers without disability.3  Physical disability 
resulting from injury or illness is c haracterized by a loss of physical function and mobility. A decision to pursue 
pregnancy should involve well- informed deliberation between a woman and her clinicians  given potential risks 
and tradeoffs in health (e.g., pre -term birth, miscarriage, infectio n) and function (e.g., further loss of mobility 
and independence) . Unfortunately, enduring stigma continues to influence the experience of many WWPD 
seeking counsel about pregnancy.4 Receipt of  family planning services are highly variable, with WWPD with low 
education, low income and who are unemployed  are particularly disadvantaged.5 Clinicians’ limited competence 
in disability6,[ADDRESS_280969] decision -making process for many. The 
development of a decision -making tool specifically for WWPD considering pregnancy can significantly improve 
the decision -making process by [CONTACT_232858] – that is, decisions that are informed by [CONTACT_232859]’s values and preferences. Ultimately, a better decision -making process can 
improve healthcare quality  and outcomes for this population of women. However, many pregnancy -related 
decision -making tools focus on pre -natal testing or delivery options9 and few , if any , focus on the decision to 
become pregnant. None are designed to comprehensively address the complexities, challenges, and biases that WWPD often face in the decision to pursue p regnancy.  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a long history of stigma and discrimination, tens of thousands of WWPD in the U.S. are having children 
every year; a substantial number do so despi[INVESTIGATOR_79615] a severe disability.

ill-informed and inadequate healthcare dramatically out of step with the hopes of WWP D.  
METHODS  
Sample Characteristics  – In this study, physical disability is defined by [CONTACT_232860]. It can occur as a result of but not limited to: 1) traumatic injury, such as spi[INVESTIGATOR_1828]; 2) neuro -developmental conditions, such as cerebral palsy; 3) chronic medical 
conditions, such as multiple scl erosis; or 4) a combination of these. Three items from the Behavioral Risk Factors 
Surveillance System
14 will determine disability severity based on the nee d for assistance with daily life activities 
and/or personal care; women with mild, moderate or severe severity will be eligible. Women who are eligible will be actively planning or in the process of making a decision about whether or not to get pregnant  in the near 
future . The language is deliberately open based on feedback from women during development . The decision -
making  process or many women with physical disabilities can be protracted given many uncertainties and a 
general lack of information and healt h care provider expertise.  
Description of the Decision Making Tool  – The decision making tool is a 23-page tool and set of 9 downloadable 
worksheets  (uploaded in Section 12, Exemption 3, #8  of the application) . We developed the tool through 
iterative brainstorming sessions with stakeholders and used  a survey , focus group , and interview data from 
women with physical disabilities who have been pregnant, decided not to get pregnant, or are considering a future pregnancy. The tool  covers topi[INVESTIGATOR_232849] a 
 HUM00189778 Protocol  v2, 10.28 .2020                                                                                                                                   Page 3 of 9 
 pregnancy  and reflects core elements of decision making tools based on the Ottawa Framework for Decision 
Support.15 This framework targets determinants of decisions that may be potentially modifiable by a decision -
making tool, but are currently suboptimal for patients and health care providers due to factors such as 
inadequate knowledge, high uncertainty, or biased perceptions of others.   
Section Title  Content  
Overview of Pregnancy  Reviews changes in a woman’s body during pregnancy. This is not meant to be 
exhaustive but a general overview.  
Knowing what is important to 
you Reflects ODSF’ values  component. It has several options to answer questions about 
values to explore what is important to guide decision -making. The associated 
worksheet (#1) focuses on what is important as a foundation for decision -making.  
Partners, family and important 
relationships  Reflects ODFS’ support  component. Guides talking about the decision and  engaging 
those most important in discussions. The two associated worksheets support 
conversations about pregnancy and decision making that can be challenging to have 
(#2 and #3).   
Physical function and 
independence  Reviews major domains of physical function and the possible effects of pregnancy on 
independence. The associated worksheet (#4) highlights topic areas to discuss with 
different health care providers.  
Health and wellbeing  An overview of the different medical specialties that might  be involved in care during 
planning and during a pregnancy and reviews major areas of mental and physical 
health that could be affected during pregnancy. The associated worksheet (#5) 
presents a series of questions to review with family and health care pr oviders.  
Caring for an infant  Encourages consideration of various aspects of caring for an infant that may be 
relevant. The associated worksheet (#6) provides a list of considerations to support further dialog with family and health care providers.  
Finan cial resources & 
insurance  Addresses the need for financial planning in anticipation of a pregnancy and childcare. 
The associated worksheet (#7) reviews various aspects of planning to consider as part 
of decision -making.  
How to find reliable 
information a nd resources  Provides guidance for how to find information and judge its quality. The associated 
worksheet (#8) provides a step -by-step guide for evaluating online resources.  
Connecting with other women 
with physical disabilities  General guidance for connecting to peers.  
Dealing with reactions of 
others, stigma and bias, pressure  Addresses the pressures women with disabilities can face during decision -making 
about pregnancy.  
Reaching a decision  A closing section that highlights acceptance of wherever  the user is in the decision -
making process, the different ways they may feel, and encourages taking breaks if 
needed.   
Intervention Delivery, Feasibility and Efficacy Testing  – We will provide the tool for a [ADDRESS_280971] design was selected following the 
recommendations of O’Connor and Jacobsen16 for pi[INVESTIGATOR_232850] -making tools; this will help us 
prepare the tool for the next phase of testing that will utilize a parallel groups design. Similarly, th e sample size 
was based on feasibility at this stage of the tool’s development. We will assess outcomes at baseline, 6 weeks 
and the end of the trial period. For pi[INVESTIGATOR_232851]’s development, we are interested in several dimensions of feasi bility and preliminary support for its efficacy. Using Bowen et al.’s phases of 
 HUM00189778 Protocol  v2, 10.28 .2020                                                                                                                                   Page 4 of 9 
 intervention development,17 we are primarily concern ed with assessing “ can it work” .  Participants will be 
compensated $40 for their time.  
Outcome Assessment  – In pi[INVESTIGATOR_232852], we are interested in feasibility  and preliminary 
effectiveness. Specifically, we are interested in the tool’s acceptability, demand for it, and its implementation (or 
use of the tool). For preliminary efficacy , the goal for pi[INVESTIGATOR_232853] a woman to make a decision about 
pregnancy during the intervention period. Rather, assessment will focus on three  domains of interest we expect 
to be influenced positively by [CONTACT_232861].  
We will also ask a sub -set of wome n if they would be interested in an opened ended interview to learn more 
about their experience using the tool and any other feedback they wish to share. This is not required and is not 
highly structured; it will be an informal conversation for those wishing to share more in depth feedback.  
• Decisional conflict is characterized by [CONTACT_232862] a decision . The Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS)[ADDRESS_280972] , the support subscale  for having the support of others,  and the 
values subscale  for clarity of values.  
• Decision or choice predisposition will be assessed using the single -item Stage of Decision -Making Scale.21 
The scale ranges from “haven’t begun to think about choices” to “have already made a decision and unlikely 
to change my mind”  but are modified to fit pregnancy and excludes the option of not  having begun to think 
about choices since we are only including women actively planning or considering a future pregnancy.  
Outcomes , measures, and time when collected are summarized in the table.  All measures will be completed via 
online survey, or by [CONTACT_232863].

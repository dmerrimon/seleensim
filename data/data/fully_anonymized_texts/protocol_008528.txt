Title: A Multicenter Phase 2 Study of the Bruton ’s Tyrosine Kinase (Btk) Inhibitor, 
PCI-[ZIP_CODE], in Subjects with Relapsed or Relapsed and Refractory Multiple 
Myeloma 
Protocol Number: PCYC-1111-CA 
Phase: 2 
Duration of Study: Approximately Five Years  
Indication: Relapsed or relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (MM) 
Study Drug and 
Comparator: PCI-[ZIP_CODE] (ibrutinib) p.o. hard gelatin capsule and Dexamethasone p.o.  
No comparator is used in this study.  
Objectives: The primary objective of this study is to determine the efficacy of PCI-[ZIP_CODE], 
both as a single agent and in combinati on with dexamethasone, in subjects with 
relapsed or relapsed and refractory MM as measured by [CONTACT_375827] (CBR), defined as the proportion of subjects who achieve stringent complete response (sCR), complete response (CR),very good partial response (VGPR), partial response (PR), or minimal response (MR) as 
assessed by [CONTACT_599281] (IMWG) 
response criteria.  
Secondary objectives are to evaluate the efficacy of PCI-[ZIP_CODE] in this 
population as assessed by [CONTACT_599282] (DCB; ≥MR), 
objective response rate (ORR; ≥PR), duration of objective response (DOR), 
and the safety and drug pharmacokinetics (PK).  
Exploratory objectives are to evaluate progression-free survival (PFS), 
time to progression (TTP), overall survival (OS). 
Study Design: This is a Phase 2, open-label, nonrandomized, multi-cohort, multicenter Simon 2-stage study designed to assess the safety and efficacy of PCI-[ZIP_CODE] in subjects with relapsed or relapsed and refractory MM.  
Treatment of PCI-[ZIP_CODE] 420 mg once daily in the original protocol 
(hereafter referred to as Cohort 1) was d esigned to detect a meaningful signal 
of activity while minimizing risk of continuing enrollment under null 
conditions.  Amendment 1 was designed to further explore the optimal regimen by [CONTACT_599283]-[ZIP_CODE] and/or by [CONTACT_599284].   
Stage 1: 
• Up to eighteen (18) subjects will be enrolled to each Cohort 2, 3, 
and 4, for a maximum total of 54 subjects. 
• Stage 1 enrollment to Cohorts 3 and 4 may begin concurrently after Cohort 2 Stage 1 enrollment is complete.  If there is concurrent enrollment, Sponsor will implement centralized assignments into 
cohorts. 
 
 
  
PCI-[ZIP_CODE] (Ibrutinib) PCYC-1111-CA, Amendment 6  18 April 2016 
Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 4 Stage 2: 
• If ≥ 3 CBRs are observed within Cohorts 2, 3, or 4 in Stage 1, 
the Cohort(s) may be selected for expansion for up to a total of 
enrollment of 43 subjects or until observing ≥ 8 CBRs, whichever 
occurs earlier. 
• If there is concurrent Stage [ADDRESS_792763] regimen which gives optimal efficacy and safety results at interim analysis for further development while 
suspend other cohorts at any time. 
The expected total enrollment including Cohort 1 is between 67 (minimal) 
and 164 subjects. 
The dose cohorts are summarized in the table below.

Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 9 Concomitant Therapy 
and Clinical Practice: Permitted Concomitant Therapy  
Antiemetics or other standard supportive  agents are permitted as clinically 
indicated.  Hematopoietic growth fact ors are permitted per ASCO Guidelines55.  
Short courses (<14 days) of corticosteroids (at dosages equivalent to prednisone ≤ 20 mg per day) for treatment of non-cancer-related medical 
reasons are permitted. 
Prohibited Concomitant Therapy
 
Any chemotherapy, other myeloma-targeted therapy including “IMiDs” 
(eg, lenalidomide) and proteosome inhibitors (eg, bortezomib), anticancer immunotherapy and corticosteroids are prohibited.  Experimental therapy and 
radiotherapy to treat the underlying myeloma disease are also prohibited. 
Refer to 
1Appendix 2  for guidance on drugs that are CYP P450 inhibitors. 
Refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS] for guidance on concomitant use of anticoagulants. 
Statistical Methods: Subjects who meet the stated eligibilit y requirements will be enrolled in the 
study.   Full enrollment to Cohort 1 will be cont ingent upon Simon 2-stage design rules 
with a target sample size of 35 evaluable subjects based on meeting interim 
efficacy endpoints ie, if ≥ [ADDRESS_792779] the null hypothesis that the CBR of PCI-[ZIP_CODE] monotherapy at a dose of 420 mg/day is ≤ 10% (not 
clinically compelling) versus the a lternative hypothesis that CBR will be 
≥ 30%, at a 1-sided significance level of 5%, with 85% power.  An interim 
analysis for futility will be performed wh en [ADDRESS_792780] evaluable response data (ie, completed [ADDRESS_792781] discontinued treatment) or earlier if two or more 
subjects have documented CBR, defined as a MR or better.  Further enrollment to Cohort 1will be halted if there are fewer than [ADDRESS_792782] stage 
enrollment will not be contingent u pon results in the other cohorts.  
Full enrollment to Cohorts 2, 3, and 4 will be contingent upon Simon 2-stage 
design rules with a sample size of up to 43 evaluable subjects based on meeting interim efficacy endpoints, ie, if ≥ [ADDRESS_792783] cohort.  This design has 80% power to reject the null hypothesis of CBR ≤  10%, at a 1-sided significance level of 5%. 
Observation of ≥ 8 CBRs within an expanded cohort of up to 43 subjects will 
be considered consistent with th e alternative hypothesis of CBR rate ≥ 25%.  
The enrollment of that cohort may be  closed early for success once [ADDRESS_792784] comparison of 
CBR among the cohorts.  Results of this study will inform alternative 
directions for future combination and single-agent development in alternative 
MM study populations.   
The final analyses will occur upon study completion.

2.0 INTRODUCTION 
2.1 Overview of the Disease 
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a di
sseminated malignant proliferation of plasma cells and 
plasmacytoid cells.1  Its yearly [LOCATION_002] (US) age-adjusted incidence of 5.4/100,000 is 
comparable to that of chronic lymphocy tic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma 
(CLL/SLL; 5.7/100,000), which in turn is sec ond only to diffuse large B cell lymphoma 
(DLBCL; 6.9/100,000) among lymphoid malignancy subtypes.  Its most recently estimated 
(Surveillance Epi[INVESTIGATOR_70299] [SEER ]) population based 5-year survival of 37.7% 
is inferior to those of CLL/SLL (77.1%) and DLBCL (59%).[ADDRESS_792797] 
significant areas of unmet medical need, in terms of survival and incidence, among lymphoid malignancies.  Myeloma cell growth occurs within bones and specifically involves the bone 
marrow.  Its clinical hallmarks include bone destruction, which may be manifested by [CONTACT_599290], severe osteopenia, pa thologic fractures and hypercal cemia, and impaired bone marrow 
function, which may result in anemia, thrombocytope nia, and neutropenia.  Bone destruction in 
particular is a major cause of severe and disa bling morbidity in myeloma.  Bone lesions are 
present in the majority of patients at presentation  and nearly all patients by [CONTACT_599291].  Myeloma cells typi[INVESTIGATOR_599251] 1 (or rarely more) monoclonal paraprotein 
(M protein) molecule, which may be intact immu noglobulin (usually IgG or IgA; rarely IgD, E, 
or M) or free ( κ or λ) light chains.  Examples of comple tely nonsecretory myeloma are rare.  
Myeloma M proteins can cause numerous comp lications including renal insufficiency, 
amyloidosis, hyperviscosity, and neuropathy.  The va rious direct and indire ct destructive effects 
of myeloma cells render MM pa tients highly symptomatic and challenging to manage.  
In addition, these patients are su bject to greater morbidity and higher mortality compared to 
those with the more common subtypes of lymphoma.  
PCI-[ZIP_CODE] (Ibrutinib) PCYC-1111-CA, Amendment 6  18 April 2016 
Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 19 Myeloma cells are highly dependent upon the bo ne marrow microenvironment, including the 
presence of certain cytokines (eg, interleukin-6 [IL-6]), chem okines, macromolecules in the 
extracellular matrix, and supportiv e cells (stromal cells), for their growth and survival.  
Crucial cytokines and chemokines are secreted into the microenvironment by [CONTACT_167666] (BM) 
stromal cells, and some by [CONTACT_599292].  Adhesion of MM cells to BM stromal cells 
triggers secretion of cytokines, which augmen t MM cell growth and survival and confers drug 
resistance.[ADDRESS_792798] growth factor–2, and other 
factors secreted by [CONTACT_375823]/or BM stromal cells  promote angiogenesis, and thereby [CONTACT_375824].  More recently, much progress has been made in 
elucidating the role of osteocla sts in the development of lytic  lesions and in reciprocally 
contributing to a microenvironment supportive of myeloma cell growth and progression.  
Multiple myeloma cells stimulate osteoclastogenesis by [CONTACT_375825] κB ligand (RANKL), IL-6, and macr ophage inhibitory protein-1 α 
(MIP-1α), while osteoclasts themselves may produce IL-6, as well as interact with stromal cells.  
These interactions contribute to a favorable microenvironment for myeloma cell adhesion and 
proliferation.3-8 
Historically, the available treatments for MM were based upon alkylators (melphalan or 
cyclophosphamide), anthracyclines, dexamethasone, or vincristine in various combinations.  
Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], 50% to 70% of subjects achieved an ob jective response to these regimens with little, 
if any, impact upon survival.  Current regimens include lenalidomide, thalidomide, bortezomib, 
and liposomal doxorubicin.  These regimens co mmonly also incorporat e high- or low-dose 
dexamethasone, and may also include melphalan fo r patients who are not tr ansplant candidates.  
Front-line therapy for most patients genera lly includes bortezomib and/or lenalidomide.1 
Survival following failure to th ese 2 agents is extremely poor.9 
High-dose alkylating agent chemotherapy, with or  without total body irradiation, followed by 
[CONTACT_599293] (ASCT) can achieve high (40%) complete 
response rates and a similar perc entage of partial responses.[ADDRESS_792799], patients.10-14  Syngeneic or allogeneic 
transplantation (allo-SCT or BMT) is perfor med less frequently, but patients can remain 
progression free at long in tervals post transplant.11,15-20  Once a patient relapses after single or 
tandem high-dose therapi[INVESTIGATOR_599252], there may not be an acceptable 
therapeutic option. 
2.2 PCI-[ZIP_CODE] (Ibrutinib) Background 
PCI-[ZIP_CODE] (ibrutinib; I MBRUVICA®) is a first-in-class, potent, or ally administered covalently-
binding inhibitor of Bruton’s tyrosi ne kinase (Btk) for the treatm ent of B-cell malignancies.   
Ibrutinib has been approved in many regions, including the US and EU, for indications covering 
the treatment of patients with mantle cell lym phoma (MCL) who have re ceived at least 1 prior 
therapy, patients with chronic lymphocytic leuke mia (CLL) including CLL with a deletion of the 
PCI-[ZIP_CODE] (Ibrutinib) PCYC-1111-CA, Amendment 6  18 April 2016 
Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 20 short arm of chromosome 17 (del17p) or a TP53 mutation, and patients with Waldenström’s 
Macroglobulinemia.  Ibrutinib is currently under investigation in other various indications as a 
single agent and in combinations.   
B cells are lymphocytes with multiple functions in the immune response, including antigen 
presentation, antibody production, and cytokine  release.  B cells express cell surface 
immunoglobulins comprising the B- cell receptor (BCR), which is  activated by [CONTACT_375826].  Antigen binding induces receptor aggr egation and the clustering and activation of 
multiple tyrosine kinases, which in turn act ivate further downstream signaling pathways.[ADDRESS_792800] hematopoietic cells with the excepti on of T-cells and natural killer 
(NK) cells, but the selective effect  of Btk mutations suggests that it s primary functional role is in 
antigen receptor signaling in B-cells.21   
Data from Study PCYC-[ZIP_CODE] demonstrate that although PCI-[ZIP_CODE] is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_36062], once dail y dosing with PCI-[ZIP_CODE] is adequate to sustain 
maximal pharmacodynamic activity fo r 24 hours postdose at dose levels ≥2.5 mg/kg.  In Study 
PCYC-[ZIP_CODE], the Btk occupancies for the 2.5 mg/ kg/day to 12.5 mg/kg/day cohorts and for the 
560 mg continuous dosing cohort, were all above 90% at either [ADDRESS_792801] version of th e PCI-[ZIP_CODE] Investigator's Brochure (IB).  
2.3 Btk and Multiple Myeloma 
Although Btk is markedly down-regu lated in normal plasma cells, it is highly expressed in the 
m
alignant cells from many myeloma patients and some cell lines.  Chauhan et al,22 showed that 
Btk mRNA expression was 2.3-fold increased in  6 MM patient specimens compared to normal 
human marrow precursors.  Kong et al,23 noted increased expression in 84% of primary myeloma 
samples and among some cell lines, especially ANBL-6 and INA-6, both of which are IL-6 
dependent.  Bam et al,24 reported expression particularly among cases within the MF gene 
PCI-[ZIP_CODE] (Ibrutinib) PCYC-1111-CA, Amendment 6  18 April 2016 
Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 21 expression profile (GEP) groupi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and also comm only in cases within the DC-1, DC-2, HY, 
and LB subgroups.25,26  Multiple myeloma cells with the MF  GEP are known to be particularly 
dependent upon micro-environmenta l interactions and integrin β7-based adherence to the bone 
marrow stroma.27  These cases tend to be clinically aggressive.  The DC-2 GEP subtype often 
carries t(11;14) (q13, q32), wh ich involves the same chromosomes and bands as the 
characteristic translocation of mantle cell lym phoma (MCL), albeit with  differing breakpoints.  
This subtype tends to have a lymphoplasmacytic cytology, rather than purely plasmacytic 
cytology, and to express multiple markers associ ated with BCR or its function, including CD20, 
CD79a, VPREB, and PAX5.28  Since inhibition of stromal adhe rence is an important mechanistic 
feature of PCI-[ZIP_CODE] activity and since PCI-[ZIP_CODE] has significant clinical activity in MCL and 
lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL), it is reasonab le to anticipate clin ical activity in MM, 
especially in subtypes with such features.  
The ability of PCI-[ADDRESS_792802] (OC) development and function, as well as micro-
environmental interactions, is a further basis to test this drug in MM patients.  As specialized 
mature cells of the myelomonocytic lineage, OCs are known to express Btk.  Although neither 
Xid mice nor XLA patients have a clear clinical defect  related to loss of Btk function, recent 
observations have shown that Btk is nonethele ss important in OC function and development.  
Monocytic OC precursor cells from Xid mice are defective in multinucleate osteoclast formation 
in response to RANKL.29  Btk/TEC knockout (KO) mice (but not Btk KO mice) have 
osteopetrotic bones associated with  defective osteoclast formation.[ADDRESS_792803] been tested at clinically re levant (ie, submicromolar) levels.[ADDRESS_792804] independently reported increased Btk 
expression in cell subfractions (CD138neg or CXCR4+) and expect them to be enriched for this

Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 22 colony forming population,23,24 compared to the bulk population of MM cells.  Consistent with 
this observation, Matsui found PCI-[ZIP_CODE] to be i nhibitory to in vitro colony formation by 
[CONTACT_398]138neg cells (but not growth of CD138+ cells in bulk culture) from  5/[ADDRESS_792805] of PCI-[ZIP_CODE] on the self-renewing 
subpopulation would further explai n the difficulty of documenting inhibition of short-term 
cultures of predominantly CD138+ non-fractionated cells.  Such a selective effect could be 
advantageous for clinical use, as putative st em cells tend to be re sistant to conventional 
antineoplastic agents. 
In summary, PCI-[ADDRESS_792806] pot entially important clinical activity in MM by 
[CONTACT_599294] (1) OC function and development resulting in 
bone destruction, (2) micro-envi ronmental interactions importa nt for MM cell adherence and 
growth, and (3) MM repopulating cell growth.

2.4.1 Nonclinical Studies with PCI-[ZIP_CODE] 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pharmacology 
PCI-[ZIP_CODE] was designed as a selective and irreversible inhibitor of the Btk protein,34 in vitro, 
PCI-[ZIP_CODE] is a potent inhib itor of Btk activity (IC 50 = 0.39 nM).  The irreversible binding of 
PCI-[ZIP_CODE] to cysteine-481 in the active site of Btk results in sustaine d inhibition of Btk and 
enhanced selectivity over other kinases that do no t contain a cysteine at  this position.  When 
added directly to human whole blood, PCI- [ZIP_CODE] inhibited signal transduction from the BCR 
and blocked activation of B cells (IC 50 = 80 nM).  Inhibition of B cell activation by [CONTACT_9090]-[ZIP_CODE] in 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells was measured by [CONTACT_599295]69 following stimulation of th e BCR with anti-immunoglobulin antibodies.  
Continuous exposure to 10 nM PCI-[ZIP_CODE] for 18 hour s resulted in the complete prevention of 
up-regulation of CD69, whereas up- regulation of CD69 induced by T cell receptor stimulus was 
blocked only by [CONTACT_599296] 10 µM PCI-[ZIP_CODE], indicating that  PCI-[ZIP_CODE] is more 
than 1000-fold selective for inhibition of antig en receptor signaling in B cells over T cells.35  
PCI-[ZIP_CODE] arrested cell growth a nd induced apoptosis in human B cell lymphoma cell lines in 
vitro and inhibited tumor growth in vivo in xenograft models.35  In mice, tumor growth inhibition 
was demonstrated at dose levels where no ove rt toxicity was observed, as measured by [CONTACT_36080].  In addition, PCI-[ZIP_CODE] was efficacious in a mouse model of collagen-induced arthritis, 
a disease whose pathogenesis involves B cell activation. 
PCI-[ZIP_CODE] (Ibrutinib) PCYC-1111-CA, Amendment 6  18 April 2016 
Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 23 Binding of PCI-[ZIP_CODE] to the active site of Btk (Btk  occupancy) was demonstrated in vivo in rat 
and dog blood mononuclear cells, mouse splenocytes, and xenograft tumor cells using a 
pharmacodynamic assay, which uses a specially designed Btk-binding fluorescent probe.  
The probe binds irreversibly to the active site of Btk, enabling fluorescent detection of labeled 
Btk protein.  The presence of PCI-[ZIP_CODE] bound to the Btk active site precludes probe binding, 
thus reducing the fluorescence probe signal.  In mice, 50% of the Btk active sites in splenocytes 
were occupi[INVESTIGATOR_530] 3 hours following a single oral dose of PCI-[ZIP_CODE] at 5 mg/kg.  Mice orally 
administered PCI-[ZIP_CODE] 30 mg/kg had complete Bt k active-site occupancy in splenocytes, 
which persisted for approximately 12 hours postdose.  In dogs, a single oral dose of 10 mg/kg 
resulted in complete occupancy of Btk m easured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
(PBMCs).  The complete occupancy persisted for ≥ 24 hours with partia l recovery by 48 hours 
postdose.  PCI-[ZIP_CODE] added to human blood (ex vivo) led to complete Btk occupancy 
(IC 50= 100 nM) and inhibition of B cell activation measured by [CONTACT_398]69 expression. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Toxicology 
Four-week safety studies in rats (2.5, 40, and 300 mg/kg/day for ma
les and 2.5, 40, and 
150 mg/kg/day for females) and dogs (1.5, 24, and 150 mg/kg/day) have been performed.  At the 
respective highest dosage, minor to mild clinical  signs and histopathologic findings were noted.   
A cardiac study in radiotelemetry-monitored dogs (single doses of 24 and 150 mg/kg) also has 
been performed.  Lower heart ra tes were observed from 1 to 6 hours postdose, consistent with 
prolongation of the RR interval.  No treatment-related prolongation of the corrected QT interval 
(QTc) was observed. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis,  Im pairment of Fertility 
Carcinogenicity studies have not  been conducted with PCI-[ZIP_CODE]. 
PCI-[ZIP_CODE] was not mutagenic in a bacterial mutageni city (Ames) assay, was not clastogenic in a 
chromosome aberration assay in mammalian (CHO) cells, nor was it clastogenic in an in vivo 
bone marrow micronucleus assay in mice at doses up to 2000 mg/kg. 
Fertility studies with PCI-[ADDRESS_792808] not been c onducted in animals.  In the general toxicology 
studies conducted in rats and dogs , orally administered ibrutinib did not result in adverse effects 
on reproductive organs.

[IP_ADDRESS] Atrial Fibrillation 
Atrial fibrillation and at rial flutter have been reported in  subjects treated with ibrutinib, 
particularly in subjects with car diac risk factors, hypertension, acute infections, and a previous 
history of atrial fibrillation.  Fo r atrial fibrillation wh ich persists, consider the risks and benefits 
of ibrutinib treatment and follow the pr otocol dose m
odification guidelines (see Section 6.5.1). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Bleeding-related Events 
There are reports of hemorrhagic events in subjec ts treated with ibrutini b, both with and without 
thrombocytopenia.  These include minor hemorrhag ic events such as contusion, epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940], and 
petechiae; and ma
jor hemorrhagic events, some fatal, including gastrointestinal bleeding, 
intracranial hemorrhage, and hematuria.  Us e of ibrutinib in s ubjects requiring other 
anticoagulants or medications that  inhibit platelet function may in crease the risk of bleeding.  
Subjects with congenital bleeding diat hesis have not been studied.  See Section [IP_ADDRESS] for 
guidance on concomitant use of anticoagulants, an tiplatelet therapy and/or supplements.  See

reported in subjects treat ed with ibrutinib.  
[IP_ADDRESS]
 Diarrhea  
Diarrhea is the most frequen tly reported non-hematologic AE with ibrutinib monotherapy and 
combination therapy.  Other frequently reported g
astrointestinal events include nausea, vomiting, 
and constipation.  These events are rarely severe .  These events are rarely severe.  Should 
symptoms be severe or prolonged follow the protocol dose modification guidelines 
(see Section 6.5.1).  
[IP_ADDRESS] Infections  
Fatal and non-fatal infections have  occurred with ibruti nib therapy.  At least 25% of subjects with 
MCL and 35% of subjects with CLL had Grad e 3 or greater infections per NCI Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE).  The most commonly reported infections 
include pneumonia, cellulitis, urin ary tract infection and sepsis.  Although causality has not been 
estab

[IP_ADDRESS] Tumor Lysis Syndrome 
There have been reports of tumor lysis syndr ome (TLS) events in subjects treated with 
single-agent ibrutinib or in com
bination with ch emotherapy.  Subjects at risk of TLS are those 
with comorbidities and/or risk factors such as high tumor burden prior to treatment, increased 
uric acid (hyperuricemia), elevated LDH, bulky disease at baseline, and pre ‐existing kidney 
abnormalities. 
2.4.4 Clinical Pharmacokinetics 
Following oral administration of ibrutinib at doses ranging from 420 to 840 m
g/day, exposure to 
ibrutinib increased proportionally to doses increased with substantial intersubject variability. The 
mean half life (t1/2) of ibrutin ib  ranged from 4 to 13 hours, with a median time to maximum 
plasma concentration (Tmax) of 2 hours. Taking into account the approximate doubling in mean systemic exposure when dosed with food and the fa vorable safety profile, ibrutinib can be dosed 
with or without food. Ibrutin ib is extensively metabolized primarily by [CONTACT_9058] 
P450 (CYP) 3A4. The on-target effects of metabo lite PCI-[ADDRESS_792810] dose 
exposure. Less than 1% of ibrutinib is excreted  renally. Ibrutinib exposure is not altered in 
patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) >30 mL/min. Patients with severe renal impairment or 
patients on dialysis have not been studied. Following single dose administration, the AUC of 
ibrutinib increased 2.7-, 8.2- and 9.8-fold in subj ects with mild (Child-P ugh class A), moderate 
(Child-Pugh class B), and severe (Child-Pugh class C) hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal liver function. A higher proportion of  Grade 3 or higher adverse reactions were 
reported in patients with B-cell malignancie s (CLL, MCL and WM) with mild hepatic 
impairment based on NCI organ dysfunction work ing group (NCI-ODWG) criteria for hepatic 
dysfunction compared to patients with normal hepatic function. 
2.4.5 PCYC-1111-CA Stage 1 Summary 
As of 31 December 2013, a total of 69 subjects were
 enrolled in Stage 1: 13 subjects in Cohort 1, 
18 subjects in Cohort 2, 18 subjects in Cohort 3 and 20 subjects in Cohort 4.   
PCI-[ZIP_CODE] (Ibrutinib) PCYC-1111-CA, Amendment 6  18 April 2016 
Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 27 The observed safety profile acro ss the four tested c ohorts in this ongoing study did not indicate 
clinically meaningful differences and the overall obtained safety prof ile with ibrutinib alone or in 
combination is consistent with the reported treatment-emergent AEs detailed in the current 
version of the IB for PCI-[ZIP_CODE].   
Efficacy data collection is ongoing with 19 subjects still on treatment and 4 subjects treated for 
more than 6 cycles.  The Simon 2-stage enrollment expansion criteria were met for Cohort 4 with 
4 confirmed minimal responses (MR) a nd 9 subjects remaining on treatment. 
2.5 Rationale for Study Design and Dose 
This study is based upon the biology of Btk and its inhibition in MM from preclinical laboratory 
studies conducted ( Section 2.4.1
).  PCI-[ADDRESS_792811] potentially important 
clinical activity in MM by [CONTACT_599297] (1) OC function and 
developm
ent resulting in bone de struction, (2) micro-environmenta l interactions important for 
MM cell adherence and growth, and (3) MM repopulating cell gr owth.  The extremely broad 
activity noted in early  phase clinical studies of PC I-[ADDRESS_792812]/WM a nd MCL, is also supportive of exploring clinical effects in 
MM subjects.   
This multi-cohort study follows a 2-stage design among previously treated subjects, with dosing 
in the first cohort consisting of 420 mg per da y PCI-[ZIP_CODE] (3 x 140-mg capsules) administered 
once daily without interruption.  Pharmacodynami c analysis in a Phase 1 study PCYC-[ZIP_CODE] and 
Phase 2 study PCYC-1102-CA revealed comple te Btk active-site occupancy at doses of 
2.5 mg/kg and above, including the [ADDRESS_792813] dose safely 
explored in the Phase 1 study was 12.5 mg/kg, and ex tensive experience has b een gained at doses 
of 8.3 mg/kg as well as at fixed doses of 560 and 840 mg/day in a number of studies.  
No maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was establishe d in studies conducted at these doses.  In a 
subsequent Phase 1b/2 study of CLL/SLL dosed  with 420 vs 840 mg/day (PCYC-1102-CA), 
neither responses nor toxicity was significantly different between the two arms.  Therefore, 
a substantial margin of safety  has been established for dosing at 420 (up to 840) mg/day.  
The safety profile of PCI-[ADDRESS_792814] been added to explore both 
higher doses and the routine addition of dexame thasone; the rationales for these changes are 
summarized as follows: 
PCI-[ZIP_CODE] (Ibrutinib) PCYC-1111-CA, Amendment 6  18 April 2016 
Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 28 While 420 mg/day is the dose that has been applie d in Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies of CLL/SLL, 
a higher dose of 560 mg/day is used in Phase 2 studies of the more aggressive NHL subtypes 
DLBCL and MCL.  There are several rationales fo r considering higher doses in some settings 
including:  1) expectation of higher rates of mutations of Btk and related signaling molecule 
genes in more aggressive diseases with greater chromosomal instability;  2) differing levels of 
tissue exposure or cellular penetra tion;  3) possible PK differences among individuals in different 
disease populations;  and 4) possible further acti vity benefit from inhibition of other kinase 
targets (e.g. BLK, BMX, ITK) at higher drug exposure levels.   
Dexamethasone 40 mg p.o. weekly (termed “low dose or LD dexamethasone”) is added to the 
treatment of subjects in  Cohorts 1 and 3 with evidence of ear ly disease progression (PD) with the 
goal of short-term stabilization to potentially a llow more gradually deve lopi[INVESTIGATOR_599255]-[ADDRESS_792815] cycle.  Myeloma regimens ar e commonly augmented with dexamethasone, which 
often appears to improve respons e to other agents.  More specifically, Btk expression was found 
to be up-regulated at both the protein and mRNA  levels in MM1R dexa methasone-resistant cells 
compared to the sensitive parent line MM1S, sugge sting a possible role of  Btk in the mechanism 
of dexamethasone resistance.22  Dexamethasone has been noted to be markedly synergistic with 
PCI-[ZIP_CODE] in vitro growth inhibiti on of lymphoma cell lines (Pha rmacyclics, unpublished data).  
PCI-[ADDRESS_792816] had consistently limited 
activity:  ORR = 19% to 23%, CR = < 1% to  4%, and TTP = 3.5 to 4.7 months [Revlimid® and 
Velcade® package inserts].  The PCYC-1111-CA st udy eligibility selects a more heavily 
pretreated population co mpared to the Revlimid® and Velcade® pi[INVESTIGATOR_36491].  Thus, in an 
analysis of the APEX trial data, ORR and median TTP to high dose  dexamethasone among 
bortezomib-naïve patients previously treated wi th thalidomide was significantly decreased to 
10% and 2.[ADDRESS_792817] development and function in vitro as 
well as bone destruction in vivo ( Section 2.4.1).  Biomarkers of bone turnover40 and cytokine and 
chemokine levels4,6-8,41 will be obtained during the study.  Increased peripheral blood tumor cell 
mobilization or trafficking has been fre quently observed both in CLL and non-CLL 
non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma subjects treated with PCI-[ZIP_CODE].42  Peripheral blood levels of CD138+ 
cells, and their pattern of CD45 and CD38 expression, will therefore be measured among 
subjects treated in this study.

6.3 Dosage and Administration  
6.3.1 PCI-[ZIP_CODE] 
PCI-[ZIP_CODE] 140-mg capsules are intended to be adm
inistered orally once daily with 8 ounces 
(approximately 240 mL) of water (avoid grapefruit or Seville orange juic e due to CYP450 3A4/5 
inhibition).  The capsules should be swallowed intact and subjects should not attempt to open 
PCI-[ZIP_CODE] (Ibrutinib) PCYC-1111-CA, Amendment 6  18 April 2016 
Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 37 capsules or dissolve them in water.  Subjects should refrain from taking the study drug on the 
morning of study visits designated for PK  sampling until seen at the site (see Section 7.1.2).  
One cycle of treatment is once-daily administration of PCI-[ZIP_CODE] for 28 days.  
Dosages are as follows: 
Cohort PCI-[ZIP_CODE] (mg/day) Dexamethasone 
1 420 (3 capsules) Upon PD, 40 mg once weekly is allowed 
2 560 (4 capsules) 40 mg once weekly 
3 840 (6 capsules) Upon PD, 40 mg once weekly is allowed 
4 840 (6 capsules) [ADDRESS_792839] is deriving 
clinical benefit (SD or better) and the subject is not experien cing any unacceptable toxicity. 
PCI-[ADDRESS_792840] be returned and 
drug accountability records ( Section 10.8) updated according to the schedule in Appendix 4. 
Returned capsules must not be re-dispensed to the same subject or  to another subject. 
Investigators are prohibited from supplying PCI-[ADDRESS_792841] ering the study drug. 
6.3.2 Dexamethasone 
Subjects rec
eiving dexamethasone will receive 40 mg orally once per week.  Dexame
thasone 
may be taken as either a single dose in the morn ing or as divided doses over the course of the 
day.

Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 38 6.3.3 Combination of PCI-[ZIP_CODE] and Dexamethasone Dosing  
[IP_ADDRESS] For Subjects with PD (Cohorts 1 and 3) 
At the discretion of the investig ator and after Cycle 1, subjects in Cohorts [ADDRESS_792842] PD 
and who are clinically stable, w ithout significant worsening of symptoms or hematologic status 
(ie, meet all entry criteria for the study in rega rd to symptoms and hemato logy), will be eligible 
to receive dexamethasone [ADDRESS_792843] re peat laboratory samples collected prior to 
addition of dexamethasone.  Dexamethasone admi nistration may commence at any time during a 
PCI-[ZIP_CODE] cycle.  Blood samples for PK should be obtained during the initial cycle with added 
dexamethasone (Cohort 1 and 3 only), according to Section 7.1.2.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Concurrent Dosing of PCI-[ZIP_CODE]/Dexamethasone Combination 
(Cohorts 2 and 4) 
PCI-[ZIP_CODE] will be administered orally once dail y at dosages of 560 mg (Cohort 2) and 840 mg 
(Cohort 4).  Dexamethasone 40 mg will be admi
nistered orally once weekly, starting Day 4 of 
Cycle 1.  The rationale for this timing is to 1)  prevent toxicity from dexamethasone confounding 
safety and tolerability as might occur if admi nistered concurrently on Day 1, and 2) to allow 
intra-subject assessment of impact  of dexamethasone on PCI-[ZIP_CODE] PK. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Concurrent Dosing of PCI-[ZIP_CODE]/Dexamethasone Combination (Cohort 4 expansion) 
PCI-[ZIP_CODE] will be administered orally once daily at a dose of 840 mg (6 x 140 mg capsules).  
Dexamethasone [ADDRESS_792844] 
begins in some cases within hours of the firs t administration and has been maximal within 
weeks.  It has been often accompanied by [CONTACT_28423] d symptomatic improvement.  It is therefore 
possible that increased MM cells  will appear in the blood samp les collected early on in the 
treatment of subjects during this study.  If such a phenom enon occurs, continued observation or 
treatment should be discussed with the medical mon itor.  Note:  an increase in the presence of 
circulating plasma cells in peripheral blood in the absence of other indicato rs of active disease is 
not an indicator of PD.

6.7.3 Guidelines for PCI-[ZIP_CODE] Management  with Surgeries or Procedures  
PCI-[ZIP_CODE] may increase risk of bleeding with inva sive procedures or surgery.  The following 
guidance should be applied during the perioperative period for s ubjects who require surgical 
intervention or an invasive pr ocedure while receiving PCI-[ZIP_CODE]: 
[IP_ADDRESS] Minor Surgical Procedures 
For minor procedures (such as a central line pl acement, needle biopsy, lumbar puncture [other 
than shunt reservoir access], thor acentesis, o
r paracentesis) PCI-[ADDRESS_792851] is  on PCI-[ZIP_CODE], it is not 
necessary to holdCI-[ZIP_CODE].   
[IP_ADDRESS] Major Surgical Procedures 
For any surgery or invasive procedure requiring sutures or staples for closure, PCI-[ADDRESS_792852] 7 days after the 
procedure and restarted at the disc retion of the investigator when the surgical site is reasonably 
healed without serosanguineous drainage or the need for drainage tubes.   
PCI-[ZIP_CODE] (Ibrutinib) PCYC-1111-CA, Amendment 6  18 April 2016 
Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 42 [IP_ADDRESS] Emergency Procedures 
For emergency procedures, PCI-[ADDRESS_792853] 7 days after the urgent surgical procedure, whichever is 
longer. 
6.8 Precautions 
For complete information on precautions refer to the IB. 
6.8.1
 Medications to be Used w
ith Caution 
[IP_ADDRESS] Concomitant Use of CYP Inhibiting/Inducing Drugs 
Ibrutinib is metabolized primarily by [CONTACT_097]3A4. Avoid co-administration with strong CYP3A4 or 
moderate CYP3A inhibitors and consider alte rnative agents with less CY
P3A inhibition.  
• If a strong CYP3A inhibitor (eg, ketoconazo le, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, 
saquinavir, clarithromycin, telithromycin, itr aconazole, nefazadone, or cobicistat) must 
be used, reduce ibrutinib dos e to 140 mg or withhold treatment for the duration of 
inhibitor use.  Subjects should be monito red for signs of ibrutinib toxicity.  
• If a moderate CYP3A inhibito r (eg, voriconazole, erythromyc in, amprenavir, aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053], 
atazanavir, ciprofloxacin, crizotinib, dar unavir/ritonavir, diltiazem, fluconazole, 
fosamprenavir, imatinib, verapamil, amiodar one, or dronedarone) must be used, reduce 
ibrutinib to 280 mg for those subjects receiv ing 840 mg and to 140 mg for those subjects 
receiving doses below 840 mg fo r the duration of the inhibitor use.  For subjects who are 
already on moderate CYP3A inhibitor concomit antly with ibrutinib without significant 
toxicity the investigator ma y consider the overall risk-b enefit to determine if a dose 
reduction of ibrutinib is a ppropriate.  Avoid grapefruit and Seville oranges during 
ibrutinib treatment, as these contain moderate inhibitors of CYP3A (see Section 6.3.1). 
• No dose adjustment is required in co mbination with mild inhibitors.  
Avoid concomitant use of strong CYP3A inducer s (eg, carbam
azepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], rifampin, phenytoin, and 
St. John’s Wort).  Consider alternative agents with less CYP3A induction. 
A list of common CYP3A inhibitors  and inducers is provided in 3Appendix 2. 
For further information, please refe r to the current version of the IB and examples of inhibitors, 
inducers, and substrates can be found at http://medicine.iupui.e du/clinpharm/ddis/main-table/.  
This website is continually revised and s hould be checked frequently for updates.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Drugs That May Have Their Plasma Concentrations Altered by [CONTACT_9090]-[ZIP_CODE]

).43,44  Confirmation of investigator-asse ssed responses by [CONTACT_599316] (IRC) may be done as a suppor tive assessment.  The method of independent 
review will be governed by [CONTACT_599317]. 
8.2 Definition of Analysis Populations 
The following definitions will be used for the efficacy and safety analysis sets. 
• Modified ITT population:  All enrolled subjects who receiv
e ≥ 1 dose of study drug.  
• Safety analysis population:   All enrolled subjects who receive ≥ 1 dose of study drug. 
• Response evaluable population:   All enrolled subjects who receive ≥ 1 dose of study 
drug and undergo ≥ 1 response assessment af ter start of treatment. 
Unless otherwise specified, the Modified ITT popul ation will be the primary population used for 
analyzing the efficacy endpoints.  The response eval uable population will be used for sensitivity 
analysis for efficacy.  The Safety analysis popu lation will be used for analyzing the safety 
endpoints.

8.3.1 Demographic/Baseline Characteristics and Study Conduct 
Subject demographics (including age, sex, and r ace/ethnicity) and other baseline characteristics 
(including ECOG perform
ance status, disease burden, and number of prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) will be 
summarized.  Summary statistics will include means, standard deviations, and medians for 
continuous variables and proportions for categorical variables.   
Further, compliance parameters (including numbe r of doses taken compared with number of 
doses that should have been taken) and concurrent treatments will also be similarly summarized. 
8.3.2 Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
The primary endpoint of the study is the CBR, de fined as the proportion of subjects achieving a 
MR or better as assessed by [CONTACT_599305] ( Appendix 5).43,44 
The primary efficacy analysis will be performe d in the Modified ITT population.  CBR and its 
corresponding 2-sided 90% exact binomial confidence interval will be calculated.  For subjects 
in Cohorts 1 and 3, CBR will be calculated during PCI-[ZIP_CODE] monotherapy period as primary 
analysis.  CBR across the whole study cour se (including PCI-[ZIP_CODE] and dexamethasone 
combination therapy period) will be calculated  and presented as secondary analysis.   
8.3.3 Secondary/Exploratory Efficacy Endpoints 
[IP_ADDRESS] Duration of Clinical Benefit (DCB) 
Duration of clinical benefit (DCB) will include  only subjects with confirmed responses 
(MR or better).  DCB will be calculated fr
om the first observation of response to the time of PD, 
with death from causes other than progression censored.  Kaplan-Meier methodology will be 
used to estimate DOR and corresponding quartil es (including the median).  A 2-sided 95% 
confidence interval will be provided for the median DOR. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Objective Response Rate (ORR) 
Objective response rate (ORR) is define d as the proportion of subjects achieving CR 
(including sCR) + PR (including VGPR) as a ssessed by [CONTACT_599318].  ORR and its corresponding 2-sided 90% exact binom
ial confidence interval will be 
calculated.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Duration of Response (DOR) 
Duration of response (DOR) will include only subject s with confirmed responses (PR or better).  
DOR will be calculated from the first observation of response to the time of  PD, with death from 
causes other than progression censored.  Kaplan-Meier m
ethodology will be used to estimate 
DOR and corresponding quartiles (i ncluding the median).  A 2-si ded 95% confidence interval 
will be provided for the median DOR.

[IP_ADDRESS] Progression-free Survival (PFS) 
Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the duration from star t of the treatme
nt to PD or 
death (regardless of cause of death), whichever comes first.  Kaplan-Meier methodology will be 
used to estimate event-free curves and correspondi ng quartiles (including the median).  A 2-sided 
95% confidence interval will be  provided for the median PFS. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Time to Progression (TTP) 
Time
 to progression (TTP) is defined as the durati on from start of treatment to PD, with deaths 
from causes other than progression censored.  Kaplan-Meier methodology will be used to 
estimate TTP and corresponding quartiles (includi ng the median).  A 2-sided 95% confidence 
interval will be provided for the median TTP. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Overall Survival (OS) 
Overall surv
ival (OS) is defined as the durat ion from first study drug administration until the 
date of death from any cause.  Subjects who are know n to be alive as of data analysis cutoff date 
will be censored at their date last known aliv e.  Kaplan-Meier methodology will be used to 
estimate OS curves and corre sponding quartiles (inc luding the median).  A 2-sided 95% 
confidence interval will be provided for the median OS. 
8.3.5 Safety Endpoint 
Safe

(number and percentage) of treatment-emergent AEs will be reported by [CONTACT_61132]® System 
Organ Class and Preferred Term.  Additional AE summaries will include AE frequency by 
[CONTACT_147483]. 
Adverse events requiring permanent disc ontinuation of study drug will be summarized 
separately, both overall and by [CONTACT_599319].

Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 55 420 mg/day is ≤ 10% (not clinically compelling) versus the alternative hypothesis that CBR will 
be ≥ 30% at a 1-sided signifi cance level of 5%, with 85%  power.  Observation of ≥  7 CBRs 
within an expanded cohort of 35 subjects will be considered c onsistent with the alternative 
hypothesis of CBR rate ≥ 30%. 
Although the design described abov e is setup to detect cohort specific CBRs of 30%, CBRs as 
low as 20% is still considered clinically meaningful, as the drug may be developed in 
combination therapy and/or in less heavily pre- treated populations.  With this 2-stage design, 
the probability to continue enrolling subjects fo r the second stage is approximately 0.68 if the 
true CBR rate is 20%.  
8.5.2 Cohorts 2-4

Up to eighteen subjects will be enrolled to each  subsequent cohort (2-4).  Stage 1 enrollment to 
Cohorts 2, 3, and 4 will not be contingent upon resu lts of preceding cohorts.  Full enrollment to 
Cohort 2, 3, and 4 will be contingent upon Simon 2- stage design rules with a sample size of  up 
to 43 evaluable subjects based on meeti ng interim efficacy endpoints, ie, if ≥ [ADDRESS_792879] cohort.  This design has 80% power to 
reject the null hypothesis of CBR ≤ 10%, at a 1-sided 5% signif icance level.  Observation of ≥ 8

9.1 Safety Monitoring 
The study's investigators and data 
coordinators are responsible for entering the data and safety of 
this study, including implementation of  the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_89020].  
All sites are required to use the eCRFs provi ded by [CONTACT_4530].  All sites will be 
monitored on an ongoing basis by [CONTACT_4530].  
Safety data is monitored in accordance with the sponsor's Pharmacovigilance Committee 
procedures.  Adverse events a nd serious adverse events will be  reviewed internally on an 
ongoing basis to identify safety concerns.

be any unfavorable and uninte nded sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational study drug, 
whether or not considered related to the study drug. 
For the purposes of this clinical study, AEs in clude only treatment-emergent events that are 
either new or represent detectable ex acerbations of pre-existing conditions.  
Disease progression is not an AE; rather it may be the cause of an AE.  Adverse events that occur 
due to disease progression must be reported as all other treatme nt emergent AEs.  “Disease 
progression” should never be an AE. Adverse events may include, but are not limited to: 
• Subjective or objective symptoms spontaneous ly offered by [CONTACT_3184]/or observed 
by [CONTACT_599320]. 
PCI-[ZIP_CODE] (Ibrutinib) PCYC-1111-CA, Amendment 6  18 April 2016 
Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 57 • Adverse events experienced by [CONTACT_599321]. 
• Adverse events not previously observed in the subject that emerge during the 
protocol-specified AE reporting period, including signs or symptoms associated with 
MM that were not present before the AE reporting period ( Section 9.3.1). 
• Com
plications that occur as a result of pr otocol-mandated interventions (eg, invasive 
procedures such as biopsies). 
The following are NOT considered an AE: 
• Pre-existing Condition:   A pre-existing condition (doc umented on the medical history 
CRF) is not considered an AE unless the seve rity, frequency, or character of the event 
worsens during the study period. 
• Preplanned or Elective Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]:   A hospi[INVESTIGATOR_147440], but rather a therapeutic intervention.  However, if during 
the pre-planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_599271], the event will be consid ered an SAE.  Surgeries or interventions 
that were under consideration, but not performed before enro llment in the study will not 
be considered serious if they are performe d after enrollment in the study for a condition 
that has not changed from its ba seline level.  Elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14150], 
solely for the administration of therapy, or due to long tr avel distances are also not 
considered SAEs. 
• Diagnostic Testing and Procedures:   Testing and procedures should not to be reported 
as AEs or SAEs, but rather the cause for the test or procedure should be reported. 
9.2.2 Serious Adverse Event 
The terms “severe ” and “serious” are not s ynonymous.  “Severity” (or intensity) refers to the 
grade of an AE, whereas “serious” is
 a regulatory definition. 
An SAE (experience) or reaction is any unt oward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
• results in death (ie, the AE actually causes or leads to death). 
• is life-threatening (“life-threatening” is define d as an AE in which the subject was at risk 
of death at the time of the event.  It does not refer to an event th at hypothetically might 
have caused death if it were more severe.  If either the investigator or the Sponsor 
believes that an AE meets the definition of life-threatening, it will be considered 
life-threatening). 
• requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] > 24 hours or prolongation of ex isting hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
• results in persistent or significant disability/i ncapacity (ie, the AE results in substantial 
disruption of the subject’s abilit y to conduct normal life functions). 
• is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
• is an important medical event that may not result in death, be imme diately life-threatening 
or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_599272], based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, in the event may jeopardi ze the subject or may require medical or 
PCI-[ZIP_CODE] (Ibrutinib) PCYC-1111-CA, Amendment 6  18 April 2016 
Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 58 surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in this definition.  
Examples of such events are intensive treatm ent in an emergency department or at home 
for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias  or convulsions that do not result in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development of  drug dependency or drug abuse.  
Given that the investigator’s pe rspective may be informed by [CONTACT_36091], 
and the Sponsor is likely to have broader knowle dge of the drug and its effects to inform its 
evaluation of the significance of the event, if eith er the Sponsor or the investigator believes that 
the event is serious, the event will be considered serious. 
9.2.3 Severity 
Definitions found in the CTCAE v4.0 will be us
ed fo r grading the severity (intensity) of AEs.  
The CTCAE v4.[ADDRESS_792885] experi ence any AE not listed in the CTCAE v4.0, 
the following grading system should be used to assess severity: 
• Grade 1 (Mild AE) – experiences that ar e usually transient,  requiring no special 
treatment, and not interfering with the subject’s daily activities. 
• Grade 2 (Moderate AE) – experiences that in troduce some level of inconvenience or 
concern to the subject, and that may inte rfere with daily activities, but are usually 
ameliorated by [CONTACT_14212]. 
• Grade 3 (Severe AE) – experiences that are unacceptable or intolerable, significantly 
interrupt the subject’s usual daily activity, and require sy stemic drug therapy or other 
treatment. 
• Grade 4 (Life-threatening or di sabling AE) – experien ces that cause the subject to be in 
imminent danger of death. 
• Grade 5 (Death related to AE) – experi ences that result in subject death. 
9.2.4 Causality 
The investigator is to a
ssess the causal relation (ie, whether there is a reasonable possibility that 
the study drug caused the event) using the following definitions: 
Unrelated: Another cause of the AE is more plau sible; a temporal sequence cannot be 
established with the onset of the AE and administration of the 
investigational product; or, a causal relationship is considered biologically 
implausible. 
Possibly Related: There is a clinically plausi ble time sequence between onset of the AE and 
administration of the investigational product, but the AE could also be 
attributed to concurrent or underlying disease, or the use of other drugs or 
procedures.  Possibly related should be used when the investigational 
product is one of several biologically plausible AE causes. 
Definitely Related: The AE is clearly rela ted to use of the investigational product.

An “unexpected” AE is an AE that is not listed in the IB or is not listed at the sp
ecificity or 
severity that has been observed.  For example, hepatic necrosis would be “unexpected” (by [CONTACT_36092]) if the IB referred only to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis.  Similarly, 
cerebral thromboembolism and cereb ral vasculitis would be “unexpe cted” (by [CONTACT_36093]) if the IB listed only cerebral vascular accidents.  “Unexpected” also refers to AEs 
that are mentioned in the IB as occurring with  a class of drugs or as anticipated from the 
pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the 
study drug under investigation.

is present at
 the Safety Follow-up visit, the SAE (and associated AEs and concomitant 
medications) should be followed to resolution or until the investigator assesses the subject as 
stable or the subject is lost to follow-up or withdraws consent.   Resolution/stable means the

ignee will monitor this study until completion.  
Monitoring will be conducted through personal visits  with the investigator and site staff as well 
as any appropriate communications by [CONTACT_2319], fax, email, or telephone.  The purpose of monitoring 
is to ensure that the study is conducted in compliance with the protocol, standard operating 
procedures (SOPs), and other written instructions and regulatory guidelin es, and to endure the 
quality and integrity of the data.  This st udy is also subject to reviews or audits. 
To assure the accuracy of data collected in th e CRFs, it is mandatory th at the monitor/auditor 
have access to all original source documents at  reasonable times and upon reasonable notice.  
During the review of source documents, every effort  will be made to main tain the anonymity and 
confidentiality of all subjects dur ing this clinical study.  However, because of the experimental 
nature of this treatment, the investigator ag rees to allow the IRB/IEC, representatives of 
Pharmacyclics, its designated agents, and author ized employees of the appropriate regulatory 
agencies to inspect the facilities used in this study and, for purposes of verification, allow direct 
access to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_599273] s of all subjects enrolled into this study.  A statement to this 
effect will be included on the ICF and permission from authorizing the use of protected health 
information. 
Pharmacyclics or its authorized representative ma y perform an audit at any time during or after 
completion of this study.  All study-related doc umentation must be made available to the 
designated auditor.  In addition, a representative of the FDA or other Regulatory Agencies may 
choose to inspect a study site at  any time before, during, or after completion of the clinical study.  
In the event of such an inspecti on, Pharmacyclics will be available to assist in the preparation.  
All pertinent study data should be made available as requested to the Regulatory Authority for 
verification, audit, or inspection purposes.

 If at on study, the only measurable non-bone marrow parameter was 
FLC, a ≥ 50% decrease in the difference between involved and

Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 81  IMWG Response Criteria  
CATEGORY RESPONSE CRITERIA a 
Progressive Disease 
(PD) Any one or more of the following: 
• Increase of 25% from lowest value in g: 
 Serum M-component (absolute increase must be ≥0.5 g/dL)c  
 Serum M-component increase ≥1 g/dL, if starting M component 
was ≥5 g/dL  
 Urine M-component (absolute increase must be ≥ 200 mg/24 h) c 
 If at on study, the only measurable non-bone marrow parameter 
was FLC, the difference between involved and uninvolved FLC 
levels (absolute increase must be >10 mg/dL) c  
 Bone marrow plasma cell percentage (absolute % must be ≥10%)c 
Or any one or more of the following felt related to the underlying clonal 
plasma cell proliferative disorder  
 Development of new soft tissue plasmacytomas or bone lesions  
 Hypercalcemia ( ≥11.5 mg/dL)
Relapse from CR or 
sCR d Subject who has achieved confirmed CR who has any one or more of 
the following:  
• Reappearance of serum or urine M-protein by [CONTACT_145169]  
• Development of ≥5% plasma cells in the bone marrow f 
• Appearance of any other sign of progression (i.e., new plasmacytoma, 
lytic bone lesion, or hypercalcemia)
a All response categories require two consecutive assessmen ts made at any time before the institution of any new 
therapy; complete response and PR, MR and SD categories also require no known evidence of progressive or 
new bone lesions if radiographic studies were performed. Radiographic studies are not required to satisfy these 
response requirements. Bone marrow assessments need not be confirmed.  
b Presence/absence of clonal cells is based upon the k/  ratio. An abnormal k/  ratio by [CONTACT_317438]/or immunofluorescence requires a minimum of 100 plasma cells for analysis. An abnormal ratio reflecting 
presence of an abnormal clone is k/  of >4:1 or <1;2.  
c Positive immunofixation alone in a subject previously classified as CR will not be considered progression. 
d This category will ONLY be used to analyze disease free survival 
e This response category is not available for those subjects being followed by [CONTACT_357731]. 
f  Relapse from CR has the 5% cutoff versus 10% for other categories of relapse. 
g In the case where a value is felt to be a spurious result per physician discretion (for example, a possible lab 
error), that value will not be considered when determining the lowest value.

Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 82  Confirmation of Response Categories  
In order to be classified as a hematologic response, confirmation of serum monoclonal protein, 
serum immunoglobulin free light chain (when primar y determinant of response) and urine monoclonal 
protein (when primary determinant of response) results must be made by [CONTACT_99964].  Confirmation assessments may be pe rformed at any time after the initial assessment.   
• Bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]/biopsy is only required to document CR or sCR, except for subjects with bone 
marrow plasmacytosis evaluable disease only, where a bone marrow is required to document all 
response categories including progression. However, a second confirmatory bone marrow is not required to confirm response in any case 
• Radiographic studies are not required to satisfy th ese response requirements; however, if radiographic 
studies were performed there should be no ev idence of progressive or new bone lesions. 
Measurable Disease  
o Serum M-protein ≥0.5 g/dL  
o Urine M-protein ≥  200 mg/24 h 
o Serum FLC assay: Involved FLC level ≥10 mg/dL provided serum FLC ratio is abnormal 
 
The serum free light chain (sFLC) assay is of particular use in monitoring response to therapy in subjects 
who have oligo-secretory or non-secretory disease and should be used in assessing response only if the 
baseline serum and/or urine M proteins are not “mea surable” as above, and the baseline level of the 
involved FLC is “measurable.” When using this assay, it is important to note that the sFLC levels vary 
considerably with changes in renal function and in subj ects with renal insufficiency, the levels of both the  
kappa and lambda may remain elevated, but the ratio normalizes with achievement of CR. Thus, both the level of the involved and the uninvolved sFLC isotype (ie, the involved/uninvolved ratio or 
involved-uninvolved difference) should be considered in assessing response. Subjects included on the 
study on the basis of sFLC alone (ie, no measurable serum/urine m-spi[INVESTIGATOR_2531]) should be the only ones who are evaluated using sFLC response criteria. The others should follow usual criteria and ignore sFLC 
results with the exception of defining stringent complete response.

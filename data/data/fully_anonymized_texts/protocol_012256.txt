Title Of Study:SCALE UP Utah II: Community-Academic Partnership to Address COVID-19 Testing and Vaccination Among UtahCommunity Health Centers6. Study Purposes and Objectives:SCALE-UP II is a state-wide, pragmatic study conducted among 11 Community Health Center (CHC) systems and 38clinics across Utah. These CHCs serve low socioeconomic status, racially/ethnically diverse, and rural/frontierpopulations. The long-term objective of SCALE-UP II is to increase the reach, uptake, and sustainability of COVID-19testing among underserved populations. Through RADx-UP Phase I funding (SCALE-UP Utah), the team hasestablished population health management (PHM) interventions that have been used since Jan 2021 to increase theuptake of COVID-19 testing and vaccination among CHC patients. Interventions are based on a PHM approach thatuses widely available technology (i.e. cell phones and text messaging). SCALE-UP II will both build on SCALE-UPUtah PHM interventions and investigate novel interventions (i.e., Conversational Agents and Patient Navigation) thatare tailored to address individuals’ hesitancy factors and that work at the interplay between vaccination and testing.SCALE-UP II builds on long standing partnerships among the University of Utah Clinical and Translational ScienceInstitute (UofU CTSI), Association for Utah Community Health (AUCH), CHCs, and the Utah Department of Health(UDOH). CTSI and SCALE-UP II investigators are leading several COVID-[ADDRESS_17762] evidence available, patients’ specific barriers and hesitancy factors,and extensive collaboration with CHCs, AUCH, and UDOH:a. Text Messaging (TM): bidirectional text messaging to connect patients to vaccination or mailed at-home rapi[INVESTIGATOR_18882].b. Conversational Agent (CA): automated, scripted and interactive agent used to mimic human interaction to: 1)elicit specific hesitancy factors and barriers to testing; 2) provide individually tailored information to addresshesitancy and barriers; and 3) offer a connection to mailed at-home rapid test kits.c. Patient Navigation (PN): phone call from a community health worker to help address hesitancy and accessbarriers, and to offer at-home rapid test kits. Two types of PN will be tested: Request PN (RPN) will contact [CONTACT_18903] a TM/CA message. No PN will have no contact [CONTACT_18904] a patient navigator.  Prior to randomization, patients will be triaged into one of two studies based on self-reported ownership of a smartphone with internet access. The primary outcome, Testing, captures whether patients actually test with the mailed at-home test kit. Secondary outcomes include: Time-To-Vaccine (time-to-event outcome) as well as several implementationoutcomes including Reach-Engage Testing (proportion of patients that reply to an offer to receive an at-home rapi[INVESTIGATOR_18883]) and Reach-Accept Testing (proportion of patients that accept an offer to receive an at-home test kit). Asimilar set of implementation outcomes will be measured for vaccination (i.e., Reach-Engage Vaccine and Reach-Accept Vaccine).7. Is this a multi-site study, where more than one site needs IRB approval?
    Yes No8. Background and Introduction:Racial/ethnic minority, low socioeconomic status (SES), and rural populations suffer profound health inequities acrossa wide variety of diseases and conditions, as well as a disproportionate burden of the negative health consequencesof the COVID-19 pandemic. As of June 2021, the cumulative COVID case rate in Utah per 100,000 was 10,803among Whites vs. 17,541 among Latinos. The positivity rate was 14% among Whites vs. 24% among Latinos. Similardisparities persist across the nation regarding vaccination rates between urban vs. rural, high vs. low SES, and Whitevs. non-White populations. Low vaccination rates leave underserved populations at risk for local outbreaks, and morecontagious and severe variants. Thus, interventions targeting these populations at the interplay between testing andvaccination are critical for pandemic control. Not only do underserved populations experience profound healthinequities, but there is also a critical digital divide between high and low resource healthcare systems. Low resourcesettings are far less likely to adopt Health Information Technology approaches, and often do not have the capacity toimplement large scale population health management (PHM) efforts utilizing data analytics and automated patientoutreach. Community Health Centers (CHCs) are optimal settings for implementing these PHM interventions toincrease the uptake of COVID-19 testing and vaccination among underserved populations. Eleven Utah CHCsystems are participating in SCALE-UP II. Their 38 primary care clinics serve over 165,000 unique underservedpatients annually. Supported by a RADx-UP Phase I grant (SCALE-UP Utah), we have established a flexible textmessaging outreach and patient navigation infrastructure with CHCs to increase testing and vaccine uptake. SCALE-UP II will leverage this infrastructure as well as long standing partnerships among the University of Utah Clinical andTranslational Science Institute, Association for Utah Community Health, CHCs across the entire state, and the UtahDepartment of Health.

SCALE-UP Utah II is composed of two experimental studies, which allow participants access to COVID-19 testingand/or vaccine resources via technology-based interactive platforms. Participant cohorts will be selected from theelectronic medical records pulled from the participating community health centers. Minors (under 18) will be includedin the data pull, however people under the age of 18 will not be included in any of the following interventions (IE: textmessages, conversational agents, patient navigation, or surveys). Their information is included to allow for parents torequest COVID tests for their children. Children will not be contact[CONTACT_18909]. Due to this lack ofany direct contact, the study is utilizing an "assent waiver" for children under the age of 18. Participants will be triaged into one of the two designs based on self-reported smart phone access. Individuals whoreport using a smart phone will be placed in the Conversation Agent (CA) study /Text Message (TM) study andsubsequently be randomized between either a CA or TM arm. Individuals who report they do not use a smart phoneor do not respond within a certain timeframe, will be placed in the Text Message (TM) Only study. Both studies willstratify the population between two different levels of patient navigation (PN). Patient Navigation will consist of apatient navigator calling participants who request a call from a PN. Patients will be randomly assigned to either NoPN or Request PN (RPN).The CA study will utilize a customized conversational agent platform, which is HIPPA compliant to provide patientswith an interactive, dynamic experience to reach COVID-19 testing and/or vaccine resources.The TM Only study will use a bi-directional text messaging platform to send patients messages about COVID testingand/or vaccination. The message response logic is based on the patient’s responses to the messages. The answeroptions for patients will be simple and allow patients to STOP the intervention at any time.Within the Conversation Agent (CA) study and the Text Message Only (TM) study, patients will be randomized to oneof two patient navigation arms: No PN or Request PN (RPN). Patients randomized to No PN, will not be connected bya patient navigator. Patients randomized to RPN will only be called if they request a call by [CONTACT_18910].In RPN patient navigators will assist patients address barriers in engaging in COVID-19 testing and/or vaccination.Population Health Management Interventions:SCALE-UP Utah II will build on the standing partnerships among the University of Utah Clinical and TranslationalScience Institute, Association for Utah Community Health (AUCH), Community Health Centers across the state, andthe Utah Department of Health (UDOH); and will leverage infrastructure enabled in SCALE UP Utah I. Hence, wehave agile infrastructure, collaborations, and processes that are “shovel ready” to support novel, practical andscalable PHM interventions to increase COVID-19 testing and vaccination among Utah CHC patients.The study team’s primary outcome, Testing, captures whether patients complete at-home tests that were requestedthrough the study. The secondary outcomes, Time-To-Vaccine (time-to-event outcome) as well as several implementation outcomesincluding Reach-Engage Testing (proportion of patients that reply to an offer to receive an at-home rapid test kit) andReach-Accept Testing (proportion of patients that accept an offer to receive an at-home test kit). A similar set ofimplementation outcomes will be measured for vaccination (i.e., Reach-Engage Vaccine and Reach-Accept Vaccine).This experimental aims are:a. Conducting a 2 (TM vs. CA) X 2 (No PN vs. RPN) factorial design assessing intervention effects on testingoutcome. The study team hypothesizes a main effect for CA being more effective than TM Only, and a maineffect for PN, comparing RPN vs. No PN (RPN > No PN).b. Conducting a 2 arm (No PN vs. RPN) trial among a subset of participants who receive only text messaging (nochatbot). The study team hypothesizes a main effect for PN, comparing RPN vs. No PN (RPN > No PN).c. Examining factors associated with at-home testing and/or vaccination uptake over the life of the study. Thestudy team will assess predictors of outcomes and moderators of intervention effects, such as characteristics ofpatients and contextual factors related to the status of the pandemic.Text Message Only StudyOverview:The Text Message Only Study is comprised of participants who either do not answer the original screener questionregarding smart phone use or answer that they do not use a smart phone.Patients in the Text Message Only design will be randomized between two different conditions; TM only (no PN)and TM+ RPN.  Patients in the TM only condition will receive HIPAA-compliant bidirectional text messages. Texts willinclude a brief message regarding COVID-19 testing and/or vaccination information. Patients who reply “yes” will
receive additional messages with a recommendation to be tested in-clinic or at home and/or vaccinated. Additionally,they will receive in-clinic testing and/or vaccination locations/hours/phone and/or patient will be able to request an at-home testing kit, based on participating clinic involvement. At-home test kits are FDA approved, free of cost to theparticipant, and sent on behalf of the participants' clinic. Patients who reply “no” may receive a text with the clinicphone number and a note to call if anything changes. Patients in this No PN condition will not receive any PN phonecalls.Patients in the TM+RPN condition will receive the same text messages and testing/vaccination options as thepatients in the TM only condition. Patients randomized to TM+RPN will be given the option to request a call by[CONTACT_18911] a text message.Conversational Agent / Text Message StudyOverview:The Conversational Agent/Text Message Study is comprised of patients who answer the original screener questionregarding smart phone use affirmatively, meaning that they do use a smart phone.Patients in the Conversational Agent/ Text Message Study will be randomized into two different arms; 1)Conversational Agent (CA) and 2) Text Message No Conversational Agent (TM- No CA).The TM- No CA group will receive HIPAA-compliant bidirectional text messages, just like the message sent to theparticipants in the TM Only Study. Patients will be randomized between two different conditions: TM - No CA (no PN)and TM+RPN.Patients in the TM- No CA only (no PN) condition will receive HIPAA-compliant bidirectional text messages. Texts willinclude a brief message regarding COVID-19 testing and/or vaccination information. Patients who reply “yes” willreceive additional messages with a recommendation to be tested in-clinic or at home and/or vaccinated. Additionally,they will receive in-clinic testing and/or vaccination locations/hours/phone and/or patient will be able to request an at-home testing kit, based on participating clinic involvement. At-home test kits are FDA approved, free of cost to theparticipant, and sent on behalf of the participants' clinic. Patients who reply “no” may receive a text with the clinicphone number and a note to call if anything changes. Patients in this condition will not receive any patient navigationphone calls.Patients in the TM+RPN condition will receive the same text messages and testing/vaccination options as thepatients in the TM only condition. Patients randomized to TM+RPN will be given the option to request a call by[CONTACT_18911] a text message.Patients assigned to the CA arm of the CA study will receive a controlled and automated, interactive agent to aid inidentifying and providing COVID-19 testing and/or vaccine information, and provide patients with the ability to orderat-home tests to be delivered to their home. In this arm patients will be randomized between two different studyconditions; CA Only (no PN) or CA+RPN.Patients in the CA only condition will receive a HIPAA-compliant option to connect with an interactive agent.Information provided will include a brief message regarding COVID-19 testing and/or vaccination information that canbe provided to the patient, such as at-home testing kits. Patient in this arm will not receive any phone calls frompatient navigators. Patients in the CA+RPN condition will receive the same interactive agent option that provides testing/vaccinationresources and connections. Patients randomized to CA+RPN will be given the option to request a call by [CONTACT_18912].Step One:Primary Data ExtractionTo identify the cohorts for the PHM intervention, a subset of EHR data will be manually extracted from the CHCs. TheEHR reports will contain all patients [ADDRESS_17770] weekly, including all encounters in the previous week. Data fields will include riskfactors such as age, gender, body mass index, encounter diagnoses for medical co-morbidities, patient demographics(e.g., zip code, insurance status, preferred language, race/ethnicity, parental/family status); as well as cellphonenumber for text messaging and patient navigation. Participating CHCs will share these clinical encounter reports withAUCH, who will then securely transfer the data to the University of Utah study team. The data will then be hosted atthe U of U Center for High Performance Computing.The primary data extraction and use of data is designed to be covered by a waiver of informed consent, as approvedby [CONTACT_1201].Step Two:
Secondary Data Inclusion:A secondary data source for this project will be vaccination records from the Utah Statewide ImmunizationInformation Systems (USIIS). USIIS is a voluntary collection system. Individuals may opt-out of sharing their vaccinerecords with USIIS at any time. In accordance with Utah Code 26-3-7(3) Utah Department of Health allowsresearchers to request access to USIIS data for "valid research." This data sharing will be covered through a data useagreement between the University of Utah and Utah Department of Health.The process for this matched collection is as follows... Participating Community Health Centers will send USIIS a listof patients participating in SCALE UP. These records will include patient identifiers such as name, DOB, address,primary clinic, and MRN. Community Health Centers routinely send patient information to USIIS. This transfer of datais routine clinical practice and covered through DUAs between the clinics and USIIS. USIIS will then perform a matchbetween the lists from the CHCs and their vaccination records. USIIS will then send the University of Utah thematched data sets. These records will include name, DOB, address, primary clinic, MRN, and COVID-[ADDRESS_17771] up to date vaccination recordsfor patients.  Step Three:Cohort Selection & RandomizationOnce the data are securely housed at the Center for High Performance Computing, the study team will determinecohort building criteria. Cohort selection will be based on EHR data considering factors such as age, race/ethnicity,language, relevant medical comorbidities, and residence in hotspot areas. These selection criteria are consistent withrecommendations from UDOH and the CDC.Once the cohort selection criteria are determined, patients are assigned between the two study designs based ontheir answer to the smart phone screener question. Once triaged to each study, patients are then randomizedbetween the various arms and conditions within each study.  Step Four:ImplementationText Messaging Only StudyPatients assigned to the Text Message study will receive HIPPA-compliant bidirectional texts, which is acommunication method routinely used by [CONTACT_18913], to patients in high-risk cohorts. Text messages will be designedby [CONTACT_18914] a HIPPA compliant text messaging service. The text messaging service willretrieve the patient cohort from the study database to send the TMs to the patients. The text messages will appear tothe patients as having originated from their CHC. As part of their general CHC care, patients have agreed to becontact[CONTACT_18915]. Textmessages will be repeated either every 10 days or 30 days, to continuously screen for COVID-19 testing andvaccination eligibility and to provide updates. Every text message will include the option to reply STOP to ceasereceiving text messages at any time.Text messages will include a brief message regarding COVID-19 testing and/or vaccine information. The content ofthe text messages will be the same across the three different patient navigation conditions.Patients in the TM only (No PN) condition who reply “yes” will receive additional messages with a recommendation tobe tested, testing locations/hours/phone, and/or have the ability to request a free at-home test be sent to their homeon behalf of their CHC.Patients assigned to TM+RPN who reply “yes” will receive a call from a Patient Navigator. Patient Navigators will talkto patients about free at-home testing and patients will have the option to request a free at-home test sent to thepatient on behalf of their CHC.  The duration of patient navigator involvement will vary from patient to patient,depending on the complexity of the case. If a patient declines PN they will no longer receive PN intervention.Conversational Agent/Text Message StudyPatients assigned to the CA/TM Study will be randomized between receiving access to a Conversational Agent (CA)or the same bi-directional text message intervention as the Text Message Study (TM). Patients in both groups (CAand TM) will then be randomized between two arms of patient navigation, No PN or RPN. Therefore, in the CA/TMstudy, there are four different groups of participants: CA only, CA+RPN, TM only, and TM+RPN. The two arms ofpatient navigation are the same as in the TM Only Study.To avoid duplication and potential inconsistencies, patients who test positive for COVID-[ADDRESS_17772] positive with additional resources, including a community health worker program tosupport COVID-19 positive and/or high-risk patients in quarantine. Patients that request free at-home testing will notbe required to share their results with their CHC but will receive health education in case they test positive by [CONTACT_18916]. Patient Surveys:All patients that request an at-home COVID-[ADDRESS_17773] theRADx-UP Tier 1 Common Data Elements (CDEs). Surveys will first be offered online and when not completed; afollow-up phone will occur to aid in the survey completion. The survey will be offered [ADDRESS_17774] COVID tests for their children (under the age of 18) may beasked questions about the outcomes of those tests in the surveys. Because children are not directly contact[CONTACT_18917], this study will be utilizing a "waiver of assent" for children under the age of 18. Anapproved University of Utah survey vendor will administer this survey. The incentives for the survey are structured such that an individual may receive either $2, $5, or $10 as a pre-surveyincentive and either $20, $25, $28, or $[ADDRESS_17775] of dynamic survey incentives as an sub-outcome of the study. Data Transfer:Throughout the course of the study, on a quarterly basis, the study team will send identifiable patient data and studyoutcomes to project's sponsor, The National Institutes of Health. The identifiable information being transferred willinclude the CDE portion of the survey. This process will be detailed and approved through data transfer agreementsinvolving the community health centers, the Association for Utah Community Health, The University of Utah Office ofSponsored Projects, The University of Utah IRB, and Duke University, which is housing the data for the NationalInstitutes of Health.7.

Explain why the research and privacy risk of the research are no morethan minimal:The research is no more than minimal risk as neither the text messages norpatient navigation are sensitive in nature, and CHCs frequently utilize similarmethods in their normal and routine care of patients. For example,Community Health Center clinics frequently send text messages to theirpatients for appointment reminders, and use patient navigators or healthcoaches as part of routine care and treatment engagement. Furthermore,extensive procedures are in place to ensure the privacy of patients will beprotected and their data will remain confidential.

Participants randomized to receive text messages,conversational agents, or patient navigation have the option of not answeringthe text messages or the patient navigation calls if they choose, and are ableto opt-out of future messages and future calls, therefore giving them the rightto withdraw from participation in text messages, conversational agent, andpatient navigation at any time during the study. As such, a reasonable personwho is in a participant's position, whether the patient is randomized to receiveor not receive text messages, conversational agent, or patient navigation,would not consider the waiver as adversely affecting their rights and welfare.8.

Amendment IntroductionBrief Description of the Study: (This will populate from original application)SCALE-UP II is a state-wide, pragmatic study conducted among 11 Community Health Center (CHC) systems and 38 clinicsacross Utah. These CHCs serve low socioeconomic status, racially/ethnically diverse, and rural/frontier populations. The long-term objective of SCALE-UP II is to increase the reach, uptake, and sustainability of COVID-19 testing among underservedpopulations. Through RADx-UP Phase I funding (SCALE-UP Utah), the team has established population health management(PHM) interventions that have been used since Jan 2021 to increase the uptake of COVID-19 testing and vaccination amongCHC patients. Interventions are based on a PHM approach that uses widely available technology (i.e. cell phones and textmessaging). SCALE-UP II will both build on SCALE-UP Utah PHM interventions and investigate novel interventions (i.e.,Conversational Agents; Proactive vs. Reactive Patient Navigation) that are tailored to address individuals’ hesitancy factors andthat work at the interplay between vaccination and testing.SCALE-UP II builds on long standing partnerships among the University of Utah Clinical and Translational Science Institute(UofU CTSI), Association for Utah Community Health (AUCH), CHCs, and the Utah Department of Health (UDOH). CTSI andSCALE-UP II investigators are leading several COVID-[ADDRESS_17809] evidence available, patients’ specific barriers and hesitancy factors, and extensivecollaboration with CHCs, AUCH, and UDOH:1. Text Messaging (TM): bidirectional text messaging to connect patients to vaccination or mailed at-home rapid test kitsfor use as needed.2. Conversational Agent (CA): automated, scripted and interactive agent used to mimic human interaction to: 1) elicitspecific hesitancy factors and barriers to testing; 2) provide individually tailored information to address hesitancy andbarriers; and 3) offer a connection to mailed at-home rapid test kits.3. Patient Navigation (PN): phone call from a community health worker to help address hesitancy and access barriers, andto offer at-home rapid test kits. Two types of PN will be tested: Reactive PN (RPN) will contact [CONTACT_18940] a TM/CA message. Proactive PN (PPN) will contact [CONTACT_18941]/CA messaging.Prior to randomization, patients will be triaged into one of two studies based on self-reported ownership of a smart phone withinternet access. The primary outcome, Testing, captures whether patients actually test with the mailed at-home test kit. Secondary outcomes include: Time-To-Vaccine (time-to-event outcome) as well as several implementation outcomesincluding Reach-Engage Testing (proportion of patients that reply to an offer to receive an at-home rapid test kit) and Reach-Accept Testing (proportion of patients that accept an offer to receive an at-home test kit). A similar set of implementationoutcomes will be measured for vaccination (i.e., Reach-Engage Vaccine and Reach-Accept Vaccine).1. Name [CONTACT_18956]:Use a name [CONTACT_18957]. You may use

What changes are being made? List and number each change, groupi[INVESTIGATOR_18898].1. Administrative changesa. We would like to add Association for Utah Community Health as a study site. 2. Changes to study design and procedures:a. We would like to remove the CDE survey administered by a survey companyb. We would like to remove the procedure for sending data to the NIH2. Describe the reason for each of the changes described above. List and number the reasons according to thelist above.1. Administrative changesa. We need to add the Association for Utah Community Health (AUCH) as a study site because AUCH employs thecommunity health workers who work as patient navigators for this study. 2. Changes to study design and proceduresa. We need to remove the procedure for administering the CDE survey because we have not signed a contract orreliance agreement with a survey company yet. Our plan is to re-add this procedure once we have a contractedsurvey company. Because we are removing the administration of the CDE survey for this amendment, we have also removedinformation on the consent process page as well as the risks and benefits page.On the consent process page, we removed all consent language/processes that are tied to the CDE (3 month followup) survey. This includes the online consent and the phone consent. We have left the waiver of consent language inthe study because the waiver of consent is what allows for the review of patient's data at participating CHCs toestablish cohort selection. On the risks and benefits page, we have removed all of the details about the compensation that are linked to the CDE(3 month follow up) survey. The only compensation in this study is for the CDE (3 month follow up) survey, thereforethis amendment aims to remove the compensation. b. We need to remove the procedure for sending data to the NIH because we are waiting on details from the NIHregarding the secure handling and storage of these data. Once we receive these details, we will re-add this
procedure and fill out the data banking section and add safe harbor for sharing data. 3. How does each change described above affect participants? List and number the effects according to theabove list.1. Administrative changes will have no effect on participants. 2. Changes to study design will not have any effect on participants because we have not enrolled any participantsyet. 4.

Text Messaging (TM): bidirectional text messaging to connect patients to vaccination or mailed at-home rapid test kitsfor use as needed.2. Conversational Agent (CA): automated, scripted and interactive agent used to mimic human interaction to: 1) elicitspecific hesitancy factors and barriers to testing; 2) provide individually tailored information to address hesitancy andbarriers; and 3) offer a connection to mailed at-home rapid test kits.3. Patient Navigation (PN): phone call from a community health worker to help address hesitancy and access barriers, andto offer at-home rapid test kits. Two types of PN will be tested: Request PN (RPN) will contact [CONTACT_18940] a TM/CA message. No PN will have no contact [CONTACT_18904] a patient navigator.  Prior to randomization, patients will be triaged into one of two studies based on self-reported ownership of a smart phone withinternet access. The primary outcome, Testing, captures whether patients actually test with the mailed at-home test kit. Secondary outcomes include: Time-To-Vaccine (time-to-event outcome) as well as several implementation outcomesincluding Reach-Engage Testing (proportion of patients that reply to an offer to receive an at-home rapid test kit) and Reach-Accept Testing (proportion of patients that accept an offer to receive an at-home test kit). A similar set of implementationoutcomes will be measured for vaccination (i.e., Reach-Engage Vaccine and Reach-Accept Vaccine).1. Name [CONTACT_18956]:Use a name [CONTACT_18957]. You may use

Amendment IntroductionBrief Description of the Study: (This will populate from original application)SCALE-UP II is a state-wide, pragmatic study conducted among 11 Community Health Center (CHC) systems and 38 clinicsacross Utah. These CHCs serve low socioeconomic status, racially/ethnically diverse, and rural/frontier populations. The long-term objective of SCALE-UP II is to increase the reach, uptake, and sustainability of COVID-19 testing among underservedpopulations. Through RADx-UP Phase I funding (SCALE-UP Utah), the team has established population health management(PHM) interventions that have been used since Jan 2021 to increase the uptake of COVID-19 testing and vaccination amongCHC patients. Interventions are based on a PHM approach that uses widely available technology (i.e. cell phones and textmessaging). SCALE-UP II will both build on SCALE-UP Utah PHM interventions and investigate novel interventions (i.e.,Conversational Agents and Patient Navigation) that are tailored to address individuals’ hesitancy factors and that work at theinterplay between vaccination and testing.SCALE-UP II builds on long standing partnerships among the University of Utah Clinical and Translational Science Institute(UofU CTSI), Association for Utah Community Health (AUCH), CHCs, and the Utah Department of Health (UDOH). CTSI andSCALE-UP II investigators are leading several COVID-[ADDRESS_17822] evidence available, patients’ specific barriers and hesitancy factors, and extensivecollaboration with CHCs, AUCH, and UDOH:1.

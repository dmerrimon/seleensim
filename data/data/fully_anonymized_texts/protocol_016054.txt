2. Objectives
1.To evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a 4-week mindfulness program among young 
women in Puerto Rico with elevated stress
2.To explore changes in psychological resilience, psychological distress, health behaviors, and 
cardiometabolic markers (blood pressure, pulse, weight, and waist circumference).
3. Background
Cardiometabolic diseases among women in Puerto Rico. The 1.7 million women residing in Puerto Rico 
(99% identifying as Latinx)29 experience a great load of cardiometabolic diseases (i.e., adiposity, type 2 
diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035]).1-3 It is estimated that, among women in PR, the prevalence 
of overweight and obesity is 67.1%, hypertension 39.2%, hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035] 36.8%, and type 2 diabetes 
16.3%, with estimates of obesity and type 2 diabetes being higher than in men.1 With cardiometabolic 
diseases driving the majority of deaths and disability in Puerto Rico -including women,30 the steep

it is imperative to understand modifiable factors influencing women’s cardiometabolic health and guide 
early prevention efforts.
Psychological well-being and cardiometabolic health. Psychological well-being has gained attention as a 
protective factor against cardiovascular disease.4-[ADDRESS_552298] lower optimism scores than Latinx women on the mainland US 
(unpublished data). Prioritizing studies on well-being among women in Puerto Rico is of utmost 
importance given their disproportionate exposure to stressors: a 15 year-long economic crisis, the 
ravaging 2017 hurricane season (Hurricanes Irma and María) and its subsequent humanitarian crisis, the 
[ADDRESS_552299] poverty rate in the US, among 
others.14-17
Mindfulness-based Stress reduction programs (MBSR). The high burden of cardiometabolic diseases 
among women in Puerto Rico,1 their disproportionate exposure to stressors,14-17 and potentially low 
psychological well-being, highlight the need for effective behavioral interventions. The American Heart 
Association has issued a call to action for studies testing mindfulness-based interventions for 
cardiometabolic health.18 At its core, this program empowers participants to develop a profound 
awareness of the present moment, fostering a deeper understanding of their thoughts, emotions, and 
bodily sensations. Through mindfulness meditation and a series of carefully crafted exercises, MBSR 
equips individuals with powerful tools to manage stress, reduce anxiety, and enhance their overall well-
being. MBSR consists of an 8 week program with weekly sessions (usually lasting 2.5hrs), daily practice 
exercises (of 45min duration each) and an end-of-program day-long retreat. MBSR has been shown to 
improve psychological well-being, with studies documenting greater intervention effectiveness and 
acceptability for women than men. Additionally, studies have shown that mindfulness-based 
interventions reduce adiposity and hypertension.21,[ADDRESS_552300] adapted the original 
MBSR to use shortened weekly sessions (1.5- 1hr) and home practice exercises (5-15min).31 They also 
selected 4 sessions out of the original 8-week MBSR sessions to shorten the program. This responds to 
preliminary data from our focus group discussions among young women in Puerto Rico documenting 
that an 8-week long program with weekly sessions was a burden and would hinder participation.
We took these modifications by [CONTACT_436036] 4-week 
MBSR program to be delivered virtually. The original 4-week protocol by [CONTACT_436037]: Shift-and-persist and cardiometabolic markers among women in Puerto Rico: a pi[INVESTIGATOR_16282] a

Spanish version 4-week MBSR program among young women (18-29yr) with elevated stress residing in 
Puerto Rico, and will explore changes in resilience, stress, health behavior, and cardiometabolic 
outcomes. Testing the Spanish 4-week MBSR protocol in young women in Puerto Rico is needed to 
evaluate novel strategies that may be feasible and acceptable for this group. 
4. Study Endpoints
Primary endpoints: 
-Rates of recruitment and retention, adherence, and satisfaction. Adherence will be measured by [CONTACT_436038]-reported completed home practice, both 
assessed at post-intervention assessments. 
-Ratings of satisfaction, also assessed by [CONTACT_436039]-intervention assessments, will be measured with 
several questions, including one that reads “Overall, how satisfied were you with the stress reduction 
program”, “How satisfied are you NOW (after the stress reduction program) with your ability to manage 
the stress in your life?”, and “¿How much did the program helped you manage your stress?“ 
-We will also ask questions on satisfaction of the instructor and group setting: “Did you feel that the 
other participants cared about the group?”, “You felt that the instructor was very knowledgeable about 
the program”, “It was easy for you to communicate with the instructor”, and “Did you feel that the 
instructor cared about you?”
Secondary endpoints: 
-Baseline and post-intervention secondary outcome data on cardiometabolic markers (adiposity, pulse, 
and blood pressure) will be assessed online via self-report and include: changes in weight, pulse, and 
blood pressure (systolic and diastolic).
-Baseline, post-intervention, and 1-month post-intervention changes on psychological resilience and 
psychological distress will be assessed through an online survey:
-Psychological resilience: shift-and-persist (Chen et al scale), mindfulness (FFMQ-15), 
psychological flexibility (Acceptance and Action Questionnaire - version 2 (AAQ-2)). 
-Psychological distress: depression symptoms (CESD-10), PTSD symptoms (PCL-2), anxiety 
symptoms (GAD-7), and perceived stress (PSS-4)
-Health behaviors: emotional eating (TFEQ) and reward-based eating (RBD scale).
-self-reported height, weight, and blood pressure
5. Study Intervention/Design 
This is a one-arm intervention study that will explore if a 4-week MBSR program is feasible and 
acceptable among young women in Puerto Rico with elevated stress. The intervention consists 
of 4 weekly virtual sessions and daily mindfulness exercises at home (between 5-16mmin of 
duration each, according to participant’s availability). The participants will also complete three 
study assessments: baseline, post-intervention, and 1-month post-intervention. All study 
measures at all time points will be done online through questionnaires to be filled out by 
[CONTACT_4317]. 
6. Procedures Involved
Interested individuals who contact [CONTACT_1758] (via email or phone/text) for more information and/or 
provide their contact [CONTACT_436040] (see Google Forms survey 
document), will be contact[CONTACT_65312], text or email by [CONTACT_436041] a screening call

mindfulness-based trial
Page 7 of 28  Version: # 4 1/31/2024
IRB Form SOCIOB 01302023(described in detail in the Recruitment and Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria sections). All interested 
individuals will provide verbal consent prior to screening. A maximum of [ADDRESS_552302] interested participants for scheduling a screening call.
Eligible individuals will receive the REDCap link (via email or text, according to the participant’s 
preference) leading to the electronic informed consent after confirming eligibility by a research staff. 
The study personnel will describe the study protocol, discuss the informed consent, and answer any 
questions. Individuals will then fill out the electronic consent form and will be given access to the 
online baseline questionnaire (email or text). Study staff will also fill out the contact [CONTACT_436042] (see Contact [CONTACT_33655]), where data on the participant’s 
email, phone number, address and at least 2 emergency contacts will be collected. The survey is 
meant to be completed by [CONTACT_436043], but study staff will be available via phone or 
email if any question arises. This approach is currently being used in the PR-OUTLOOK study, a 
study of young adults in Puerto Rico. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_436024] (as part of other studies) and got good 
response rates.
Individuals will receive the 4-week tailored intervention in groups (3 waves of approximately 10 
participants each; these may be stacked, overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_007], or following completion of each group, according 
to the instructor’s availability). All weekly sessions will be delivered via Zoom. My team and I have the 
expertise and are equipped to recruit and implement the telephone-delivered program given our prior 
virtual studies in Puerto Rico and US Latinxs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Once in the intervention, 
participants will join one session weekly (on Zoom) and will receive access to online audio files, which 
are the daily practice exercises to be done at home. 
Each session has a duration of 1hr (except the first session which is longer due to introductions and 
describing the program’s logistics and expectations). The sessions follow a brief check-in,
lecture on the week’s topic, and guided practice. For the audio files, for each exercise, participants will 
have the opportunity to select a short version of the practice (5-8min) or a longer version (12-16min) 
according to their daily availability. The following table outlines the 4-week MBSR session topi[INVESTIGATOR_436025]-practice exercises.

Week 1 Orientation; Introduction to 
stress and its consequencesAwareness of breathing
Week 2 Awareness of sensations Body Scan
Week 3 Thoughts are not facts Awareness of thoughts
Week 4 Recap; Mindful eating, mindful

After completion of the intervention, participants are encouraged to continue doing the mindful daily 
exercises at home by [CONTACT_436044]. Following the last session, participants will be given 
access to the online questionnaire for the post-intervention measures, which will include the Contact 
[CONTACT_33655]. Research staff will have 10 attempts (via email, text or call) to contact [CONTACT_436045].

7. Data Specimen Banking
No specimens will be collected as a part of this study. Trained study staff will assess the eligibility of 
participants using a database (Excel or REDCap). Data from study assessments will be directly collected 
in REDCap. Essential study staff will only have access to the REDCap project and their study roles will 
dictate what type of access they will have. 
8. Sharing of Results with Participants
- Publication of study findings is expected, where data will be published in aggregate and 
without identifying study participants.
-A summary of the main study results will be emailed to participants upon completion of the 
study. These results will all be in aggregate and without identifying study participants.

Prisoners
Cognitively impaired or Individuals with Impaired Decision-Making Capacity
Pregnant persons
We will not include vulnerable populations.
12. Local Number of Participants
We will enroll 30 women. 
Given that 99.8% of individuals in Puerto Rico self-report as Hispanic, we expect to enroll Hispanic 
individuals. 
13. Recruitment Methods
Spanish-speaking women between 18-29 y will be recruited through flyers posted/disseminated through 
social media (e.g., Instagram, Facebook, Twitter) and social pages/accounts. These pages are those from 
mentors and collaborators outside of Emory University given that Emory pages do not currently have 
the reach to the population in Puerto Rico. These pages include collaborators that have already worked 
with the PR in other studies and include: CienciaPR, PR-CEAL, Puerto Rico Public Health Trust, Ciencia en 
Tus Manos, Estudio PROSPECT, among others. Recruitment flyers will also be disseminated through 
newsletters and email blasts at academic organizations (not including Emory) including the University of 
Puerto Rico, Ponce Health Sciences University, and San Juan Bautista School of Medicine, among others.

mindfulness-based trial
Page 12 of 28  Version: # 4 1/31/2024
IRB Form SOCIOB 01302023Additionally, the printed flyer will be distributed (in-person) at community events, health fairs and 
billboards. 
The study flyer includes a study email where interested individuals can contact [CONTACT_436047]. The flyer also includes a QR code and its respective link to a Google 
Forms survey where interested individuals can enter their contact [CONTACT_3031]. Specifically, the Google 
Forms survey only asks for  1) First and Last Name, 2) phone number and 3) email.
Interested individuals will provide verbal consent (see Verbal Consent document). Afterwards, 
individuals will be screened for eligibility via phone (see Screening Questionnaire)). Data will be directly 
entered in the database (REDCap or excel). Screening questions include age, sex, gender, PSS-4, PHQ-9, 
history of cognitive and psychiatric conditions, prior participation in an 8-week MBR program, currently 
pregnant, and access to internet/phone:
1- Female sex at birth
2- Not identifying as man, trans man, or trans woman
3- Self-reported age = needs to be between 18-29y
4- Currently residing in Puerto Rico
5- PSS-4 score >6
6- PHQ-9 scores <15
7- A negative response to item #9 (“Thoughts that you would be better off dead, or thoughts of 
hurting yourself in some way?)
8- No self-reported history of cognitive and psychiatric conditions
9- Affirmative response on access to internet/phone
10- No prior participation in an 8-week MBSR program
11- Currently not pregnant
Eligibility will be assessed via stages, first through socio-demographic characteristics (age, sex, gender, 
pregnancy, place of residence). If the individual does not meet the socio-demographic criteria, then they 
will be notified that they are not eligible. It they do meet these criteria, they will go through the PSS 
scale and notified if they are eligible upon scoring their responses. Afterwards, they will complete the 
PHQ-9 and eligibility will be assessed and notified if they are not eligible. Lastly, questions on criteria #8-
#10 will be asked and the participant will be notified of their eligibility status. The staged eligibility 
screening is done to reduce the number of people exposed to the PSS and PHQ-9 questions if they are 
not eligible according to the prior criteria. If eligible and interested in participating, the staff will send 
the REDCap link (via email or text, according to the participant’s preference) leading to the electronic 
informed consent. The study personnel will describe the study protocol, discuss the informed consent, 
and answer any questions. Individuals will then fill out the electronic consent form and will be 
given access to the online baseline questionnaire (REDCap). 
14. Withdrawal of Participants
Participants can leave a study at any time without penalty.  
The person in charge of the research study, [CONTACT_375700] López-Cepero, or any of the study 
representatives designated by [CONTACT_436048] a study participant due to lack of commitment to the

mindfulness-based trial
Page 13 of 28  Version: # 4 1/31/[ADDRESS_552307] 
common risks and discomforts expected in this study are the time commitment for the weekly sessions 
and the completion of the study assessments. The mindfulness intervention that is being tested may not 
work for study participants and they may not perceive any benefits from the intervention. Researchers 
may ask questions about stress and stress management that may upset some participants. Interviewers 
are trained on cultural sensitivity and how to minimize any discomfort, including handling sensitive 
questions and emotional reactions. We will provide a toll-free phone number that individuals may call 
for any emotional or psychological advice or referrals at any time (from línea PAS). Línea PAS is a 24hr 
365days/year phone line responding to individuals with suicidal behavior and mental health disorders. It 
offers crisis counseling and emotional support, screening, psychiatric and psychological evaluation, and 
referrals (all free of charge). In addition, information on resources to coordinate mental health services 
will be provided to all prior to completing the screening questionnaire (see Mental Health Services 
document). Lastly, as with any study collecting identifiable information, there is a risk of loss of 
confidentiality but every effort will be made to keep all personal information confidential by [CONTACT_436049], password protected data files and analysis of de-identified data. Data on criminal or civil records, 
or any sensitive or personal information that may lead to such, will not be collected.
16. Potential Benefits to Participants
We do not know if all participants will receive personal benefits from taking part in this study.  
They may not benefit directly from joining the study. However, the potential benefits could include 
learning about mindfulness, reductions in stress, and improved emotional well-being. We also hope that 
the knowledge gained from this study may help others in the future. 
17. Compensation to Participants
If all study components are completed, participants will get $[ADDRESS_552308] study assessment, they will receive a $[ADDRESS_552309]. 
-After completion of the 4-week program and the second study assessment they will receive a $[ADDRESS_552310] and final study visit (1 month after completion of the program), they will 
receive a $[ADDRESS_552311] 
deviations for continuous ones. Recruitment, adherence, retention, and satisfaction will be calculated 
for the total sample and will be explored by [CONTACT_278943] (i.e., age, income, 
employment, and education level). Changes in each secondary outcome will be evaluated using mixed 
Protocol Title: Shift-and-persist and cardiometabolic markers among women in Puerto Rico: a pi[INVESTIGATOR_16282] a 
mindfulness-based trial
Page 14 of 28  Version: # 4 1/31/[ADDRESS_552312] exploratory analyses among 
those with high levels of adherence (vs. low). STATA version [ADDRESS_552313] included a similar sample size. This sample size suits the goals of this study to assess 
feasibility.
All study staff will be up to date with the Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI) Human 
Subjects trainings and will be trained for all protocols, including informed consent and data collection. 
The research team will maintain all responses and documents confidential. Individuals participating in 
the intervention will be informed that information disclosed within the intervention sessions is 
considered confidential and should not be repeated outside of the group. The data collected will only be 
used for research purposes. Only the research team will have access to the files. The electronic consent 
form and eligibility criteria will remain stored electronically. Identifiable information will not be 
shared to anyone and will be kept in a password-protected computer at Emory University and in the PI’s 
OneDrive/SharePoint files. 
19. Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety of Participants
The screening and online survey will collect data on psychological distress, resilience, health behaviors, 
sociodemographic characteristics, and physical measurements (height, weight, waist circumference, and 
blood pressure), which will be entered real-time in REDCap (HIPPA compliant). The electronic consents 
and study files will be stored in the PI’s (Emory University’s) OneDrive and SharePoint platforms (HIPAA 
compliant). All data and project files will only be accessible by [CONTACT_436050]. Access to any 
study documents are password protected and secure laptops.
Research staff will be trained on identification and report of adverse events. All participants receive an 
information sheet on mental health resources in Puerto Rico during their screening. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_436026] 4 weekly sessions to assess intervention fidelity. Any reports by [CONTACT_436051] a potential adverse event, whether directly related to the 
protocol or not, will be recorded and reported to the IRB in order to determine whether a formal report 
should be submitted. Serious adverse event will be reported immediately. Participants are those with 
elevated stress, however, they would be screened out (excluded) if they have major depression 
symptoms. Regardless, we have designed a suicide safety protocol:
If a participant reports suicidal ideation at any point during the study (e.g., intervention session or study 
visit), research staff will contact [CONTACT_436052].

20. Provisions to Protect the Privacy Interest of Participants
As previously mentioned, screening and all study data will be stored in the PI’s (Emory 
University’s) OneDrive/SharePoint files. Only trained study personnel needing to work directly 
with the study data will have access to the files and to the REDCap database for research 
purposes only. 
Participants will be instructed to only share things that they are comfortable sharing during the 
sessions and that everything discussed during the sessions should remain confidential and 
should not be repeated outside of the group.
The data collected will only be used for research purposes. Study data will be linked using a 
unique study ID number and identifiers will be removed so there will only be a de-identified

Consent document). Informed consent will be obtained immediately after assessing eligibility of 
a study participant. Individuals will receive the REDCap link that leads to the electronic consent 
form. Consent will occur via phone call after the staff discusses the study and consent process. 
If the individual agrees to participate, they will provide an electronic signature. If technical 
difficulties arise with participants providing an electronic signature, a check on the “Yes” box 
following the statement “I consent to participate in the study” will suffice.
Non-English-Speaking Participants

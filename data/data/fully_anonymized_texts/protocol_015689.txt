Most cocaine dependent patients suffer from deficits in cognitive function that, if left untreated, predict poor ou tcome. 
Purpose: The present study investigates a pharmacotherapeutic intervention designed to improve cocaine treatment 
success by [CONTACT_226623], the brain system that is critically associated with 
chronic cocaine use and co gnitive functions. Procedures: Treatment with levodopa /carbidopa plus ropi[INVESTIGATOR_11122] (tested at 
two doses) will be compared to levodopa /carbidopa  alone, and placebo.  Measurement of performance on 
beha vioral/cognitive measures of decision-making, beha vioral inhibition, reward motivation, and attentional bias will 
be con ducted at treatment entry and at repeated time points during the 10-week treatment. It is hypothesized that treatment 
with levodop a/carbidopa  + ropi[INVESTIGATOR_226613]. Course  of Study: Eligible cocaine dependent  patients will be randomized equa lly to one of four medication 
cond itions.  Outpatient treatment will last [ADDRESS_272442] of weekly cognitive beha vioral therapy (CBT).  The primary outcome measure will be 
weekly mean p roportion of cocaine non-use days.  Seconda ry endp oints will include ab stinence rates during the last 2 
weeks of treatment, time in study, and medication co mpliance.  Enrollment:  This project requires a final intent-to-treat 
sample size of [ADDRESS_272443] phone  screens on ~ 6 40 individuals, of whom 
320 (50%) will qualify, enroll, and start intake. Of the [ADDRESS_272444] that 200 (~60%) will complete 
intake and be  randomized into the ITT sample. Based on these projections and recruitment rates achieved during our 
previous levodopa  studies, 40 months wi ll be allotted to complete study enrollment (~ 5 new subjects/month). 
Recru itment:  Adult (18-55yo) men and women of  all ethnic backgrounds w ill be recruited to participate.  Participants 
will be non-hosp italized, self-referred persons who call in response to various advertising strategies, including 
newspa per/newsletter articles and anno uncements, public service announ cements on television and radio, notices mailed 
to local professionals, city-wide billboards, and posters located throughout the local community.  Known Risks: The 
known risks associated w ith the study medications (levodopa /carbidopa,  ropi[INVESTIGATOR_226614]) inlude potential side effects but these 
are deemed minimal and w ill be clearly listed in the informed cons ent form.  Data Safety Mo nitoring: This trial will 
adhe re to general data and safety monitoring procedures.  A DSM Board will be formed to provide additional, 
independent oversight of data related to patient safety.  IND#:  N/A. Proposed Funding Source: National Institute on 
Drug Abuse (NIDA).  Communication of Study Results:  Study results will be communicated at national scientific 
meetings and to all oversight entities, e.g., NIDA, IRB.

5. Strategies for Recruitme nt and Retention 
The study will be conducted at the outpatient Treatment  Rese arch Clinic  (TRC), a component of the Department 
of Psy chiatry and Behavioral Sciences Center for Neurobehavioral Research  on Addictions (CNRA ). Participants 
will be non-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], self-referred persons who call in response to various advertising strategies, including 
newspaper/newsletter articles and announcements, public service  announcements on television and radio, 
notices mail ed to local  professionals, city-wide billboards, and posters located throughout the local  community. 
 
6. Study Inte rventions  
 
6.1 Study drug #1 
 
Levodopa. The drug, levodopa (L-3,4-dihydroxyp henylalanine), is a dopamine precursor. It is combined 
with a decar boxylase inhibitor, which prevents the levodopa from being metabolized in the peripheral 
circulation before it reaches the brain. Levodopa with the decarboxylase inhibitor carbidopa (trade 
name  [CONTACT_226632]  ), is a highly eff ective symptoma tic treatment  for the motor disability of Parkinson’s 
diseas e, a condition characterized by [CONTACT_226624]. 
Simil ar to other agents used in the treatment of Parkinson’s disease  and also studied as potential 
cocaine medications (e.g., ama ntadine, selegiline), levodopa increases  extracell ular dopamine and 
dopamine transmissio n. Levo dopa/carbidopa pharmacotherapy is safe and well tolerated in cocaine 
dependent outpatients. 
 
Participants assig ned to a levo dopa/carbidopa condition will receive the sustained release formulation 
(Sinemet CR  ), titrated  according to schedule below. The dosage and titration schedule have been 
used in our previous levodopa trials 
 
 
6.2 Study drug #2 
 
Ropi[INVESTIGATOR_11122]. The drug, ropi[INVESTIGATOR_11122], is a DA (primarily type D2 and D3) receptor agonist used in the 
treatment  of Parkinson’s disease.  Preliminary studies s uggest that ropi[INVESTIGATOR_226616], and may  reduce 
cocaine use. In an open-label trial (Meini et al.,  2008), 39 subjects with cocaine dependence received 
ropi[INVESTIGATOR_226617] 1.5 mg/day for 12 weeks. Average  rates of benzoylecgonine-positive urines decre ased 
from 90.2% at baseli ne to 17.8% at week 6. Twelve subjects achieved  sustained cocaine abstinence for 
up to 10 weeks. 
 
 
Participants assig ned to a medication com bination condition will also receive  ropi[INVESTIGATOR_226618]-release formulation (REQUIP XLTM), with a one-week dose titration schedule to reach fixed 
dose levels  of 2.0 mg/d or 4.0 mg/d, depending on study condition. These doses  were chosen based on 
a previous study of ropi[INVESTIGATOR_226619]’s disease  to minimize risk of side effects (REQUIP XLTM prescri bing information) (see titration 
schedule, below).

 Placebo.  We will use a matched placebo procedure for ma intaining the blind. Placebo capsules will be 
identical in size, color, coating and shape to the active study medication. All placebos will be packed in 
capsules with riboflavin a dded and contained in a blister pack affixed with patient instructions. 
Participants in all  conditions will take the same number of capsules at the same  scheduled times 
(morning/evening) per day throughout treatmen t. Participants will take one matching placebo twice 
per day, at the same  time they take their active study medication. 
 
 
6.4 Medicat ion Dispensing 
 
 
At each clinic visit (MWF) subjects will be administered the medication at the dispensing window and 
given  take-home doses  for intervening days. Riboflavin (50mg) will be added to the medication (and 
placebo) capsules and used as  a marker to monitor compliance. We will use a double-dummy  method 
involvi ng a matched placebo for each of the two medications. Placebo capsules will be identical in size, 
color, coating and shape. Participants in all conditions will take the same number of capsules at the 
same  scheduled times (morning/evening) per day throughout treatment.  Participants in the single 
medication condition will take one matching placebo twice per day, at the same  time they take their 
active study medication. Participants in the placebo group will take two matching placebos twice per 
day. T his method, along with additional strategies used in o ur clinic to protect the integrity of 
blindness, will be applied.

 6.5 Non medication interventions 
 
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). Participants will receive individual CBT in 50-minute weekly 
sessio ns.  Including CBT will allow us to replicate the behavioral therapy condition that proved  most 
efficacious when used previo usly in our lev odopa and citalopram trials.  Cognitive-behavioral therapy is 
based on  the model of relapse proposed  by [CONTACT_226625]. The model regards copi[INVESTIGATOR_226620]. Skills training techniques 
include (1) self-monitoring and functional analysis of  situational factors associa ted with craving or drug 
use; (2) learning alternative non-drug responses for handling high risk situations; and (3) general 
lifestyle modifications (e.g., increasing pleasant drug-free events, anger management, interperso nal 
skills, general problem-solvi ng). An unpublished treatment manual written by J. Schm itz (PI) and 
implemented in several completed studies, closely parall els the treatment  content found in other 
published CBT manuals. All CBT sessio ns will be audio-taped for adherence and competence ratings 
using recommend ed procedures done in all our treatment studies. Weekly supervisi on will be held by 
a designated clinical supervis or who will provide feedback to keep CBT delivery  consistent and prevent 
drift. 
 
Prize-based attendance CM (Co ntingency Manageme nt). During Treatment, for each visit attended, 
subjects will earn a draw from the attendance voucher “fishbowl”. The fishbowl has [ADDRESS_272447] a value of $1, some have a value of $25, one slip is worth $100, and half of the 
slips just say “G ood Job”.  Subjects will earn 5 bonus draws  for each week in which all 3 visits in a week 
(that is, Monday, Wednesday, and Friday) are attended. Vouchers for the $25 and $[ADDRESS_272448]. For the $1 slips, $1 in cash or a voucher will be giv en.

 7. Study Schedule 
7.1 General eva luation intake 
Treatment-seeking individuals will undergo  the CNRA general evaluation protocol (HSC-MS-05-0322). 
Those who complete this protocol will be eligible for Study 64, based on random allocation to study 
method. 
 
 
7.2 Study specific 
 
 
7.2.1  Enrollme nt/Rand omiza tion 
 
An urn rand omization procedure will be used to assign  subjects to one of the four treatment groups. 
This procedure will balance groups on important pretreatment characteristics that may  influence 
measures of cog nitive performance and/or treatment outcome.  The variables will include (1) seve rity 
of cocaine dependence, based on  days using cocaine in past 3 0; (2) baseline (trait) impulsivity  score, 
based on  the Barratt Impulsive ness Scale (BIS). The BIS was chosen  as a variable for the urn 
randomization because it has norms for high and low i mpu lsivity in cocaine users based on previous 
studies and has been predictive of treatment retention. 
 
Treatment assig nment will be concealed to all clinical and research staff, including the investigators. 
Only the study pharmacist who dispenses the study medication will be unblinded to participants’ 
assig ned condition. 
 
 
7.2.2  Behavioral lab assessment 
The following behavioral/cognitive laboratory  measures will be administered by a trained  research 
assis tant at designated time points. To ensure validity and compliance, eligibility for lab testing will 
require estimated  premorbid IQ  levels  > 80 (Shipley-2) and the absence of acu te cocaine intoxication 
on the day of testing (based on exam ination of DSM-IV symptoms  and urine drug screen results). One 
hour prior to testing all cigarette-smo kers will be prompted to smo ke one cigarette in a designated 
outside area. This 60-minute window has been used in previo usly funded work at the CRNA to control 
for the potentially confounding effects of either nicotine withdrawal  or acute nicotine stimulation. 
 
The Iowa Gambling Task  (IGT) is a computerized version of the original Iowa Gam bling Tas k. 
Subjects are asked to choose  between four decks of cards that result in theoretical monetary 
rewards at different rates. Each deck (labeled A, B, C, and D) contains [ADDRESS_272449]. Antoine Bechara, who 
developed the task. The primary dependent variable to be used in the statistical analyses  will 
be the net score for the IGT, calculated as the total number of cards selected from the 
advantageous minus the disadvantageous decks [(C+D)-(A+B)] across  five blocks of 20 cards 
each. 
 
The Risky Decisi on-Making Task  was developed specifically for  the asses sment of ac ute drug 
effects and repeated measurement over  time. Like the IGT, it is a computer-based task that 
provides subjects with different options over 112 repeated trials, defined as non-risky (net gain

 .01, no loss) and risky (gain/loss of 0. 25, 0.50, 0.75, or  1.00 with gain/loss probability = 0.50). 
Like the IGT, the non-risky option is more adaptive over  many trials.  Subjects start each test 
session  with $6.00. End-of-sessi on earnings can range from approximate ly +$14.00 to -$2.[ADDRESS_272450] (CPT). The version of the CPT that will be used for this study 
is the Imm ediate Memory Task (IMT). The IMT is a paradigm based on  the continuous 
perfor mance task, originally developed as a measure of attentional  capacity and the ability to 
withhold a prepotent response. Subjects are required to respond selectively to a series of 
stimuli (e.g., numbers) presented briefly for 500 ms with a 500 ms ITI. Go/No-Go paradigms 
have also shown sensitivity to acute stimulant effects. Increases  in false alarm rates  are 
interpreted as failures in response inhibition. Five-digit numbers are presented on a computer 
screen every [ADDRESS_272451] number of a set is 
repeated. A ‘hit’ response is scored when a subject correctly responds. Distracter stimuli consist 
of five-digit numbers that are  completely different from the first, and numbers in which four of 
the five digits match the origi nal, with the non-matching number occurring randomly  across the 
five digit places. A  response to a distracter is scored as a ‘false alarm’ and operationally defined 
as a failure in response inhibition. The primary dependent variable will be the percent  of false 
alarms. 
 
The Progressiv e Ratio  (motivation) Task. We operationally define motivation as a change in 
responding that is functionally related to a change in its consequences. Specifically, in the 
procedure descri bed below, we interpret the allocation of behavior  to a response option with 
increasing response requirement and corresponding increases in reward (money) value as an 
index of m otivation. The procedure presents subjects with two mutually exclusive response 
options: a progressiv e-ratio (PR) reinforcem ent schedule and a fixed-time (FT) reinforcem ent 
schedule. Monetary rewards are periodically represented by a counter located near the top of 
the on-screen display. T he PR schedule is programmed  on one option (work). The initial 
response requirement on the work option is 10 responses, and produces a reinforcer  of $0.01. 
After each reinforcer,  the response requirement is increased by [CONTACT_226626] $0.01.  Thus, each subsequent reinforcer  is 
worth more than the previous one, but requires more work to obtain it. These parameters 
effectively serve  to produce earnings that maintain subjects’ attention, maintain PR responding 
throughout at least half of the sessio n, and avoid exceptionally large ratio sizes. 
Also  availa ble during the session  is a seco nd option (non-work), which is availa ble at any time. 
Once the non-work option is selected, no responses are required to earn monetary rewards – 
money simply ac cumulates by [CONTACT_226627]-intervals  have 
elapsed. Importantly, once the non-work option has been selected, it is in eff ect for the 
remainder of the sessi on, and this change is not reversible. The non-work option amount and 
time value are yoked to the perfor mance on the work option: the reward amount is exactly  66% 
of that earned on the last completed PR (work), and the time interval for each r eward delivery 
is either the time that was required to complete the last PR  or 120 sec, whichever  is larger.

The PR and FT schedules can be thought of as work and non-work options because (a) the work 
option requires increasing behavioral output and the non-work option requires no behavioral 
output, and (b) the contingencies are arranged such that it is advantageous to remain on the 
work option, even when the PR requirement reaches very  high values near the end of the 
sessio n. The primary dependent varia bles of interest will be the largest PR completed  on the 
work option. 
 
The Coca ine Stroop. The task is administered on a desktop computer, and assesses  attentional 
biases  to cocaine-related (drug-related) and appetitive (non-drug related) stimuli vs. neutral 
stimuli. Drug-related, non-drug related, and neutral words are presented in separate blocks of 
30 trials e ach. Block order is counterbalanced over participants with a short interval  of a few 
seco nds between blocks. Stim ulus Materials: There are cocaine-related words (e.g.,  COCAINE, 
CRACK,  ROCKS, HIT); neutral words consisting of outdoor features (BRIDGE, AVENUE, 
SIDEWALK) and indoor, household, features (e.g.,  ROOM, FLOO R, CABINET); and appetitive non- 
drug related words selected from items that our cocaine-dependent participants reported 
acquiring with the money they received  (from CM) in previous pi[INVESTIGATOR_20732] (e.g.,  VACATION, 
FOOD, JEWELRY).  Categ ories are matched on length and frequency of use.  Participants are 
instructed that words written in different colors (blue, green, or red) are presented on the 
screen, one after the other, and that their task is to indicate as quickly and as accurately as 
possible  which color the word is  written in, by [CONTACT_226629] a 
keyboard. Participants are instructed to ignore the meaning of the word itself and just to 
respond to the color. On each trial, a word is  presented in capi[INVESTIGATOR_226621] a button. If the participant makes a wrong response there is 
a tone. If the participant makes no response within three seco nds the word is removed  (and 
there is a tone). Within each block, the order of words is rand omly determined by [CONTACT_226630]. The primary data analyses  are focused on reaction times (RT) to ma ke a 
response to each word. RTs less  than [ADDRESS_272453] (attentional bias) is  the difference in RTs 
on cocaine vs. neutral words, and the difference in RTs on cocaine vs. non-drug related 
appetitive words. The cocaine Stroop effects are (normally distributed) difference scores 
reflecting the difference in reaction times across  the separate  stimulus types. 
 
7.2.3  In treatment  
During the 9-week treatment phase participants will be scheduled to attend three clinic visits per week 
(MWF).  Activities conducted at these visits will include urine testing, administration of study 
medication, cognitive behavioral therapy, and prize-based  CM for attendance. Brief (5-10 m in) 
evaluations by [CONTACT_226631],

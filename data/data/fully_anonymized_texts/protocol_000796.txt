Detailed title A Phase 1/2, randomized, observer -blind, controlled, multi -
center stud y to evaluate safet y, reactogenicity and 
immunogenicity of [COMPANY_004] Biologicals’ respi[INVESTIGATOR_151495] (RSV) investigational vaccine based on the RSV viral 
proteins F, N and M2 -1 encode d by [CONTACT_489717] -derived

Rationale for the 
study and study 
designRationale for the study
[COMPANY_004] Biologicals is developi[INVESTIGATOR_489564] (ChAd155 -RSV vaccine) to protect infants from RSV 
diseases.
The purpose of this study is to provide critical information on 
the safet y, reactogenicity and immunogenicit y profile of the 
ChAd155- RSV vaccine in infants likely  to be unexposed to 
RSV before moving to a proof-of-concept trial in infants. An 
important aspect of this phase I/II stud y will be to compare a 
single lower dose of 1.5x1010viral particles (vp) and two 
higher doses of 5x1010vp according to a 0, 1 month schedule 
administered to infants aged 6 and 7 months likely to be 
unexposed to RSV, which is powered to statistically  exclude a 
level of risk of ‘vaccine- induced enhanced RSV disease’, 
associated with historic FI-RSV vaccine trials
.
Rationale for the study design
Study population: The immunogenicit y, safet y and 
reactogenicity of the pediatric candidate RSV vaccine 
(ChAd155- RSV vaccine) has been evaluated in healthy  adults 
aged 18 to 45 years (study 201974 [RSV PED -001; 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]]). A clinical study  is curr ently being 
conducted in RSV- seropositive infants aged 12 to 23 months 
(study  204838 [RSV PED -002]). The safety  profile of the 
ChAd155- RSV vaccine in adults (study  201974 [RSV PED -
001; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
]) has been evaluated and determined to 
besatisfactory  by a n Independent Data Monitoring 
Committee (I DMC). Should there be a satisfactory  safet y 
profile of the ChAd155 -
RSV vaccine in RSV- seropositive 
infants, as evaluated b y an IDMC on Day 60 data (i.e., [ADDRESS_629334] dose level) of the study  RSV 
PED -002, the present study  will be performed. This study  will

01-AUG -2019 10be conducted i n infants aged 6 and 7 months, (having a low 
chance of natural exposure to RSV before inclusion in the 
study ).Although potentially  both RSV -exposed and RSV -
unexposed subjects will be enrolled , the primary  anal ysis for 
incidence of LRTI will be conducted in 
infants with a
negative RSV exposure status (at screening based on in -
stream 
baseline serological testing ). This study  will support 
the decision to age de -escalat eto the targeted population 
(infants as from 6 weeks of age) in the subsequent study .
Control vaccine s:Active comparators are included as a 
control for the reactogenicity , safet
y and immunogenicity 
assessments. The choice of one of four control vaccines, as 
active comparators has been driven b y the fact that, in most 
countries at least one of these vaccines meet the criteria of 
being of medical benefit, and where possible licensed for 
infants and used with a similar dose and schedule as the 
investigational RSV vaccine, while not being part of a 
national immunization program. The choice of which active 
control comparator vaccine tobe used will be done at the 
country  level and will be used according to its approved label.
A placebo group was added to accommodate areques tfrom 
countries that were not able to identify  a suitable active 
comparator.
Study blinding: Given the different appearance and storage 
conditions of the investigational RSV vaccine and active 
control comp arator vaccines, double blinding is not possible 
and the study  will be conducted in an observer -blind manner.
When all data up to Day  61 are available, a statistical anal ysis 
will be performed. This analy sis may  lead to the unblinding of 
some subjects. As a consequence, after Day  61, the study  
cannot be considered as observer -blind, but will be conducted 
in a single blind manner, with subjects’ parent(s)/ legally  
acceptable representative(s) (LAR[s]) remaining blinded up to 
the last study  visit ( end of the second RSV transmission 
season ), while the investigator will still not have access to the 
individual subject treatment allocation up to the last study  
visit ( end of the second RSV transmission season), except in 
case of emergency unblinding.
Regimen, dose and route of administration:
This study  will evaluate two regimens of the ChAd155- RSV 
vaccine ;either one lower dose of 1. 5x1010vp or two doses of 
5x1010vp will be administered. For the two dose schedule ,an 
interval of approximately one month between dosing will be 
used. A single dose arm was added in this 6 -7 month -old

Adverse event: Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation subject, temporally associated with the use 
of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related 
to the medicinal product.
An adverse event (AE) can therefore be an y unfavourable 
and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory  
finding), s ymptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) 
temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal product. 
For marketed medicinal products, this also includes 
failure to produce expected benefits (i.e., lack of 
efficacy ), abuse or misuse.
Blinding: A procedure in which one or more parties to the trial are 
kept unaware of the treatment a ssignment in order to 
reduce the risk of biased study outcomes. The level of 
blinding is maintained throughout the conduct of the trial, 
and only  when the data are cleaned to an acceptable level 
of quality  will appropriate personnel be unblinded or 
when re quired in case of a serious adverse event. In a 
single -blind study , the investigator and/or his staff are 
aware of the treatment assignment but the subject is not. 
In an observer -blind study , the subject and the site and 
sponsor personnel involved in the c linical evaluation of 
the subjects are blinded while other study  personnel may  
be aware of the treatment assignment (see Section 6.3for 
details on observer -blinded studies). 
Child in care: A child who has been placed under the control or 
protection of an agency , organization, institution or entity  
by [CONTACT_285135], the government or a government body , 
acting in accordance with powers conferred on them by 
[CONTACT_6617]. The definition of a child in care can 
include a child cared for by  [CONTACT_301930] a 
care home or institution, provided that the arrangement 
falls within the definition above. The definition of a child 
in care does not in clude a child who is adopted or has an 
appointed legal guardian.
Eligible: Qualified for enrolment into the study  based upon strict 
adherence to inclusion/exclusion criteria.
End of Study
(Synonym of End of 
Trial)For studies without collection of human biologicals 
samples or imaging data EoS is the Last Subject Last

01-AUG -2019 391. INTRODUCTION
1.1. Background
1.1.1. RSV disease burden
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_227899] (RSV) is a ribonucleic acid virus of which two antigenically  
distinct subgroups exist, referred to as RSV -A and RSV -B [Borchers , 2013]. RSV is a 
highl y contagious human pathogen that causes respi[INVESTIGATOR_6014] (RTI ) in people 
of all ages.
During the first year of life, 50 -70% of infants are infected with RSV and essentially  all 
children have had an RSV infection b y their second birthday. The risk for severe 
RSV -associated lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_36115] (L RTI) is highest in infants below 
6months of age and is a leading cause of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. I t is estimated that on average 
31 per 1000 children below 6 months of age are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_489583]- associated LRTI 
Boyce, 2000; Deshpande , 2003; Hall , 2009; Holman, 2004; Iwane , 2004; Paramore , 
2004; Vicente , 2003 . 50-70% of these hospi[INVESTIGATOR_489584] Boyce, 2000; García , 2010; Hall, 
2009; Rietveld, 2004 . For human immunodeficiency  virus (HIV) -infected children, the 
incidence rate of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_443104] -associated L RTI was reported to be 2.5 -to 5-
fold greater than in HIV -uninfected children Cohen, 2015; Madhi , 2006 . Although RSV 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_489585] 6 months of age, a considerable number 
of RSV infections in children of 6 -15 months of age, still lead to bronchiolitis or 
(broncho)pneumonia requiring medical attention [ Fisher , 1997].
Previous infection with RSV does not prevent subsequent infections. Therefore, re -
infection with RSV occurs throughout an individual’s lifetime and is common in all age 
groups [ Simoes, 1999; 
Krilov, 2011]. These re -infections generally  go undiagnosed 
because they  usuall y present as comm on acute upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_36115]. I n more 
vulnerable persons (e.g., immunocompromized subjects or elderl y), re-infections can 
however also lead to severe disease [Graham , 2011] .
1.1.2. Current management of RSV disease in infants
To date, no vaccine is available against RSV and treatment of RSV disease is largely  
symptomatic and supportive care [ Murray , 2014].
The antiviral drug ribavirin is currently  the only  approved antiviral therapy for RSV 
treatment, but its use is restricted to severe hospi[INVESTIGATOR_489586] , difficulty  in administration (aerosol) and high cost  American 
Academ y of Pediatrics Subcommittee on Diagnosis and Management of Bronchiolitis , 
2006 .
RSV -specific monoclonal antibod ies (palivizumab, Synagis ) are indicated for use in 
infants at highest risk for severe RSV disease. Synagis is only  effective as prophy laxis 
and is not indicated or recommended in the general, health y infant population.

01-AUG -2019 401.1.3. History  of enhanced RSV disease with formalin- inactivated RSV 
vaccines
In the late sixties, following initial encouraging results in small clinical trials, field 
evaluation trials of a formalin inactivated vaccine targeting RSV, called FI -RSV, were 
initiated in the [LOCATION_002]. FI -RSV was cultured on monkey  kidney  cells, harvested, 
inactivated with formalin and aluminum- precipi[INVESTIGATOR_135162] (FI -RSV lot 100). Four clinical 
studies in different age groups were conducted in parallel in 1965 -1967 [ Chin , 1969; 
Fulginiti , 1969; Kapi[INVESTIGATOR_327859] , 1969; Kim, 1969] . The study results indicated that the FI -RSV 
vaccine did not protect against infection with the respective virus. In addition, children 
who had been vaccinated with the FI -RSV vaccine developed more severe clinical 
symptoms upon subsequent natural infection with RSV compared to the children who had 
not been vaccinated with the FI -RSV vaccine (resulting in [ADDRESS_629377] children were vaccinated [ Kim, 1969]). This observation is referred to as 
“FI-RSV enhanced RSV disease” (ERD) in this document. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Clinical sy mptoms of FI-RSV enhanced RSV disease
The key  clinical observations from the FI -RSV trials are summarized below. These need 
to be taken into consideration when defining potential safet y signals during the clinical 
development of new RSV vaccine candidates.
Age at t he time of FI -RSV vaccination
The four studies included children aged between 2 months and 9 y ears. When comparing 
the different age strata at which children were vaccinated in these studies (Young infants 
[0-5 months]; Older infants [6
-11 months]; Toddler s [12 -23 months]; Children [ ≥24 
months]), the most prominent increase in RSV -associated LRTI and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_489587] -RSV vaccination was observed in children vaccinated at y ounger age. In the 
study  where the youngest subjects were vaccinated [ Kim, 1969], [ADDRESS_629378] one beginning at the ag e of 2 months, the other one 
at the age of 5 months.

Specific/ defining clinical symptoms
In the four studies an attempt was made to identify specific/ defining clinical sy mptoms 
of the “FI -RSV enhanced RSV disease” by  [CONTACT_489726][INVESTIGATOR_489588]- associated LRTI  in the control group. However, 
apart from the unexpected severit y, none of the observed s ymptoms were unique in FI -
RSV vaccinated patients. Therefore, no specific/ defining s ymptom can be monitored as a 
safety signal in order to detect a similar adverse effect of new RSV vaccine candidates 
during clinical development. Finall y, no increased incidence of RSV -associated 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_489589]/or

Definition of “FI -RSV e nhanced RSV disease”
Based on the original publications, it can be summarised that “FI -RSV enhanced RSV 
disease” was:
1.Caused by  [CONTACT_489727] -RSV lot 100 (and not by [CONTACT_489728] [e.g., FI -PIV]) below 2 y ears of age.
2.More sev ere if the vaccine was administered at a younger age.
3.Initiated b y RSV infection (and not b y similar pathogens [e.g., PIV]).
4.Associated with high viral replication and shedding of RSV.
5.Defined b y increased severity and potentially duration of ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] s ymptoms of RSV -
associated LRTI (but not upper RTI): bronchiolitis/(broncho)pneumonia.

01-AUG -2019 42Key characteristics of vaccinees
RSV priming status : risk very  low in subjects that are primed for RSV ( i.e., who 
have been naturall y infected with RSV before) as vaccination of primed subjects is 
expected to amplify  the (non -pathogenic) immune response induced b y natural RSV 
infection.
Age at vaccination: risk very  low in children vaccinated at 2 y ears or older and 
progressivel y increasing with y ounger age (highest risk in in fants < [ADDRESS_629380] a more immature immune sy stem).
Age at first exposure to RSV after vaccination : risk for severe RSV disease upon 
natural infection being higher in y ounger infants, who have smaller airways and a 
more immature immune sy stem .
[IP_ADDRESS]. Serum immune responses to the FI -RSV vaccine and to subsequent 
RSV infection
During the trials with the FI- RSV vaccine, serological assay s were performed to monitor 
1) the immune response to vaccination 2) the immune response to natural infection post -
vaccination. In general, vacc inees developed high levels of total serum antibodies in 
response to vaccination (as measured b y complement fixation). When the sera of these 
infants and children were later compared with those of infants and children with natura l 
RSV infection, it could be observed that FI-RSV vaccination induced high total IgG 
antibody titers, but a relatively  low level of neutralising antibody  titers [Murphy , 1986]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pathological observations of RSV disease in FI -RSV vaccinated 
children
Post-mortem examinations of the 2 FI -RSV vaccinated children who died (aged 14 and 
16 months at time of death, vaccinated at 2 and 5 months of age, respectively )showed 
extensive bronchopneumonia in both children with patch y atelectasis, emphysema and 
pneumothorax in one of them [ Kim, 1969]. Microscopi[INVESTIGATOR_897], there was an intense 
inflammat ory infiltrate, with a predominance of neutrophils and macrophages in the lungs 
accompanied b y the occasional presence of eosinophils in smaller bronchioles; a 
pathological pi[INVESTIGATOR_489590]. Since eosinophils were also 
detected in the blood of some of the vaccinees, this finding gained a lot of attention in 
later investigations. Large quantities (104plaque -forming units [pfu] per gram) of RSV 
were recovered from the lungs and bacteria could be cultured from the lungs of both 
children ( Klebsiella from one and E. coli from the other).
Re-
examination of the original autops y report and of new histological preparations from 
the same tissues confirmed the observations, and re -emphasised the relatively  small 
contribution of eosinophils (1-2%) compared to neutrophils. Gram stain did not detect 
bacteria in the lungs, suggesting that the positive cultures may  have been due to small 
numbers of bacteria onl y (and making it less likely that the primary  cause of the disease 
process could have been bacterial) [ Prince , 2001]. During a second re- examination of the 
lung samples, evidence of immune complex deposition (arthus- like reaction) was 
detect ed in the small airway s [Polack, 2007].

01-AUG -2019 43In summary , the pathological observations indicate that 1) RSV viral replication was 
abundant, 2) the overall pathology  was consistent with severe viral bronchopneumonia 
and 3) immune complexes were formed in the small airway s.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Animal models for “FI -RSV enhanced RSV disease”
In order to better understand the pathoph ysiology  of “FI -RSV enhanced RSV disease”, 
several animal models have been developed to mimic this phenomenon. I n general, 
animal models suggest that the immunopathology  seen with the FI -RSV vaccine was a 
result of a poor functional antibody  response [ Graham , 2011; Openshaw , 2002] An 
unbalanced cellular immune response skewed towards Th2 (disturbed Th1/Th2 balance) 
could also beobserved in mouse models [ Connors , 1992; Connors , 1994; Waris , 1996], 
but is not consistently  supported by  [CONTACT_489729] [ Antonis , 2003; 
Castilow , 2008; 
Phipps, 2007]. Note that the results of animal models of FI -RSV 
enhanced RSV disea se should however be interpreted with caution due to the inherent 
differences between the animal model and humans per se and different replicative 
potential of RSV in the different species in particular.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pathophy siology  of “FI -RSV enhanced RSV disease”
Based on the clinical and pathological observations in the vaccinated children in 
combination with a large body  of data from animal models, two (non- mutually  exclusive) 
hypotheses on the immunological factors that contributed to FI -RSV enhanced RSV 
disease ha ve been proposed:
Induction of low- quality, non -neutralising antibodies. Murphy  et al observed that 
upon natural RSV infection, the FI -RSV vaccinated subjects produced high amounts 
of poorly  neutralising antibodies, indicating that natural infection booste d the low-
quality  antibody  response induced b y the FI -RSV vaccine [ Murph y, 1986]. These 
antibodies did not neutralise RSV replication and contributed to th e formation of 
immune complexes that may  have contributed to the severe clinical s ymptoms and 
potentially  immunopathology  [Polack, 2002].
Two (non -mutually exclusive) culprits for this poorly  neutralising antibody  response 
have been proposed 1) Formalin
-induced disruption of neutralising epi[INVESTIGATOR_489591], leading to an unusually  large proportion of antibodies 
directed against non -protective epi[INVESTIGATOR_322] [ Murph y, 1986; Murphy , 1988; 
Moghaddam , 2006]. 2) Formalin- induced disruption of the Toll-like receptor (TL R)-
[ADDRESS_629381] activity  of the F -protein (a major surface protein of RSV). F- protein in its 
native form is known to bind and stimulate TL R-4, which leads to antibody  affinity  
maturation and high avidity  antibodies. If this binding is disrupted, affinity 
maturation may  not (sufficiently ) occur and antibodies remain of low affinity and 
neutralising capacity  [Delgado , 2009].
An unbalanced cellular immune response . Another potential explanation is the 
induction of an unbalanced cellular immune response skewed towards Th2 
(disturbed Th1/Th2 balance) [ Connors , 1992; Connors , 1994; Waris, 1996]. This 
latter hy pothesis is however mainly  based on preclinical data in mouse models and is 
not consistently  supported by  [CONTACT_489729] [ Antonis , 2003;

balance) has been contributing to FI- RSV enhanc ed RSV disease [ Boukhva lova, 
2006].
1.1.4. Rationale for a viral vector -based RSV vaccine
Immunity  induced by  [CONTACT_489730] y prevent RSV re -infection, 
allowing re -infections to occur commonl y throughout life. Both arms of the immune 
system are involved in protection from severe disease.
The humoral immune response is capable of neutralizing the virus and inhibiting viral 
replication, thereb y playing a major role in protection against lower RSV infection and 
severe disease [ Pi[INVESTIGATOR_29422] , 2003]. I ndeed, passive immunization with RSV -specific 
monoclonal antibodies ( Synagis), when given prophy lactically , has been shown to reduce 
RSV disease in premature infants and newborns with bronchopulmonary  dysplasia or 
underly ing cardiopulmonary  disease [ Cardenas, 2005].
T-cells are also involved in the control of RSV disease. Lethal RSV infections have been 
described in patients with low CD8 T -cells counts as in the case of severe combined 
immunodeficiency , bone marrow and lung transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] [ Hertz , 1989]. The 
histopathology  of fatal cases of RSV infection of newborns shows that there is a relative 
paucity  of CD8 T -cells in the lung infiltrate [ Welliver , 2007]. Moreover, the presence of 
CD8 T -cells producing interferon gamma ( IFN-)has been associated with diminished 
both Th2 responses and eosinophilia in animal models of RSV [ Castilow , 2008; Stevens , 
2009].
A vaccine based on recombinant viral vectors carry ing relevant RSV a ntigens, mobilizing 
both humoral and cellular arms of the immune response, is considered as an adequate 
solution to induce a balanced and more effective immune response against the RSV virus 
in a naïve population. Adenoviral vector- based vaccines have been shown to be potent 
inducers of CD8 T -cells producing IFN-and antibodies against expressed antigens 
[Liniger , 2007; Barnes , 2012].
Potent immunogenicity  and lack of prolonged transgene expression have made 
replication incompetent adenoviruses attractive viral vectors for vaccine development. 
They  possess a stable virion, allowing inserts of foreign genes not to be deleted and they  
can infect man y different cell types; the transferred information remain s epi[INVESTIGATOR_489592].
Chimpanzee -derived adenoviruses exhibit sequence homology  to human adenoviruses 
within the hexon protein in particular, which is a major capsid protein used for subgroup 
classification of adenoviruses [ Roy, 2011; Colloca , 2012]. They  are not kno wn to cause 
pathological illness in humans and antibodies against chimpanzee adenoviruses have low 
or no seroprevalence ranging from 0 -4% in Europe and in the [LOCATION_002], up to 20% in 
the developi[INVESTIGATOR_14696], which is far less than the most common huma n adenovirus 
seroty pe 5 (Ad5), with seroprevalence rates of 40– 45% in the [LOCATION_002] and up to 
90% in sub- Saharan Africa [ Capone , 2013].

1.1.5. Antigens selected for the vaccine
The inve stigational vaccine is a recombinant viral vector manufactured using a s ynthetic 
deox yribonucleic acid fragment that encodes three RSV proteins:
The fusion (F) protein deleted from the transmembrane and cy toplasmic regions 
(F0TM). The F protein is a major surface antigen of the RSV virus that is well 
conserved among RSV- A and RSV -B subgroups. I n addition, it is the main target of 
the neutralizing antibod y response to RSV, which is considered essential for 
protection against RSV-associated severe disease [ Magro , 2012].
The nucleocapsid (N) protein is an internal (non -exposed) antigen, highl y conserved 
between RSV strains and known to be a source of many  T-cell epi[INVESTIGATOR_322] [ Anderson, 
2010; Townsend , 1984]. The N protein is essential for the replication and 
transcription of the RSV genome. Its primary  function is to encapsidate the virus 
genome protecting it from ribonucleases.
The matri x (M2 -1) protein is a transcription anti- termination factor that is important 
for the efficient s ynthesis of full -length messenger ribonucleic acid (RNA) as well as 
for the s ynthesis of pol ycistronic readthrough messenger RNA, which are 
characteristic of n on-segmented negative- strand RNA viruses. M2- 1 is an internal 
(non-exposed) antigen, highl y conserved between RSV strains and known to be a 
source of man y T-cell epi[INVESTIGATOR_322] [ Anderson , 2010; Townsend , 1984].

1.1.6. Pre-clinical experience
The candidate vaccine is based on the RSV viral proteins F, N and M2 -1 encoded b y a 
chimpanzee -derived adenovector (ChAd155 -RSV). A number of pre -clinical studies were 
conducted to demonstrate immunogenicit y, efficacy and safet y of intramuscular (IM) 
injection of the ChAd155 -RSV vaccine. Several animal models have been selected for 
such s tudies: mice, cotton rats and newborn calves. I mportantly , vaccination has not

vaccine high dose (5x1010viral particles [ vp]) seems to be more reactogenic (local and 
general) than the ChAd155

reactogenicity profile was less than that observed in the Bexsero group. No safet y signal 
from the assessed hematology  parameters (hemoglobin, platelet count, prothrombin time 
and APTT) was observed in subjects receiving the ChAd155
-RSV vaccine. No 
significant reductions in platelet count or clinically  significant changes in coagulation 
parameters were observed up to [ADDRESS_629384] Dose 2. An approximately  2.4-fold increase 
in RSV -A neutralizing antibody  titers (geometric mean titer [GMT] from ba seline) was 
observed in both RSV low dose and RSV high dose after Dose 1. No booster effect was 
evident after Dose 2. An anti -F IgA and IgG antibody  secreting B -cells response and an 
RSV F, N and M2- [ADDRESS_629385] dose were observed with ELISpot. There was no booster response after the 
second vaccination. There was no specific vaccine- induced CD4 T -cellular response

unexposed to RSV before moving to a proof -of-concept trial in infants. An important 
aspect of this phase I/II study  will be to compare a single lower dose of 1.5x1010viral 
particles (vp) and two higher doses of 5x1010vp according to a 0, 1 month schedule 
administered to infants aged 6 and 7 months likely to be unexposed to RSV, which is 
powered to statisticall y exclude a level of risk of ‘vaccine -induced enhanced RSV 
disease’, associated with his toric FI -RSV vaccine trials [Kim, 1969]
.
This study  is the first of a careful de- risking sequence of studies in a clinical development 
plan that will progressively  exclude ERD as a potential risk prior to Phase III.

[IP_ADDRESS]. Study  population
The immunogenicit y, safety  and reactogenicit y of the pediatric candidate RSV vaccine 
(ChAd155- RSV vaccine) has been evaluated in healthy  adults aged 18 to 45 years (study  
201974 [RSV PED -001; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]]). A clinical study  is currentl y being conducted 
in RSV -seropositive infants aged 12 to 23 months (study  204838 [RSV PED -002]). The 
safet y profile of the ChAd155 -RSV vaccine in adults (study  201974 [RSV PED -001; 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]]) has been 
deemed satisfactory  by [CONTACT_489732] (IDMC). Should there be a satisfactory  safet y profile of the 
ChAd155- RSV vaccine in RSV -seropositive infants, as evaluated b y an IDMC on Day  60 
data (i.e., [ADDRESS_629386] dose level) of the study  RSV PED -002, the 
present stud y will be performed. This study will be conducted on infants aged 6 and 7 
months (having a low chance of natural exposure to RSV before inclusion in the study )
. 
Altho ugh potentiall y both RSV -exposed and RSV -unexposed subjects will be enrolled, 
the primary  analy sis for incidence of L RTI will be conducted in infants with a negative
RSV exposure status (at screening based on 
in-stream serological testing ).This study  will 
support the decision toage de -escalat e to the targeted population (infants as from 6 weeks 
of age). 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Choice of study  population
Infants aged 6 and 7 months were selected to be vaccinated in this study  because:
Infants of this age are more likely  to be unexposed to RSV compared to older infants
[Dunn , 2013]
.
The natural course of RSV disease is generall y less severe at this age. Their airway s 
are relativel y larger and they are therefore less at risk of serious RSV -RTI than 
younger infants.
Risk of adverse outcome of natural infection following FI -RSV vaccination was 
more pronounced when the vaccine was administered to y ounger infants.
For safet y reasons, the population will have no predisposing risk factors for severe 
outcome following RSV dis ease (e.g., premature birth, past or current chronic lung 
disease, or cardiovascular disease).
[IP_ADDRESS]. In-stream serological testing of baseline samples to determine 
exposure status (Amended [ADDRESS_629387] 2019)
Subjects will not be screened for serostatus as criterion for enrolment in the study , due to 
the potential presence and detection of residual maternal antibodies (Refer to Section 
6.7.3 for more details on the determination of a negative RSV exposure status). The 
assumption is that the majority  of infants are previously  unexposed (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]). 
Serological testing of baseline samples to determine exposure status will be performed in -
stream to ensure at least 50% of infants with a negative RSV exposure status 
(at 
screening based on in-stream baseline serological testing) andthe sample size may be 
adjusted as needed through additional recruitment (Section 11.4).

[IP_ADDRESS]. Rationale for RSV disease surveilla nce
ChAd155- RSV vaccine has been successfully tested in several preclinical models 
assessing the risk of vaccine -related ERD and it was associated with a profile that did not 
suggest disease enhancement. ChAd155
-RSV vaccine induced an immune response 
assoc iated to inhibition of viral replication in the lungs in all animal models tested and 
reduction of bovine RS V-LRTI signs in y oung calves. The ChAd155 -RSV vaccine has 
been tested in young seronegative calves, which is a model that mimics natural RSV 
infecti on. Bovine RSV causes respi[INVESTIGATOR_489595] y oung calves that is very  similar to 
that observed in human infants. In addition, bovine RSV is genetically  and antigenically  
close to human RSV. Exacerbation of respi[INVESTIGATOR_489596]- bovine RSV vaccine [ Antonis , 2003]. The similarities of FI -RSV 
vaccine -induced ERD and the observed clinical signs make the newborn calve/bovine 
RSV model a relevant animal model for evaluation of safet y of human RSV vaccines. In 
this model, vaccination with ChAd155- RSV vaccine was immunogenic, protected 
initially  seronegative calves from bovine RSV infection and pulmonary  pathology  and 
did not induce ERD.
Although the risk of ERD is thought to be very  low with an adenovirus- based vaccine, a 
cautious approach is taken and this is the first of a series of trials in potentially  naïve 
infants. In this first step the minimum number of subje cts is exposed to allow detection of 
a serious signal of ERD of the magnitude that occurred in association with the RSV -FI 
trials. For details of the sample size and assumptions refer to Section 11.4. Rates of RSV 
infection are highl y variable by [CONTACT_489734] a conservative rate of infection of 
20% in the first season is taken.
All subjects will be closely  monitored for the occurrence of RSV- RTI and the earl y 
detection of ERD b y IDMC and sponsor will comprise three complementary  approaches: 
the detailed review of individual cases of RSV
-LRTI, the monitoring of the disease 
severit y of cases of RSV infection occurring in vaccinees and the compar ison of RS V-
LRTI disease rates between vaccinees and control recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].

All cases of RSV -LRTI will be considered as adverse events (AEs) of special interest 
(refer to Section 9.1.5) and will have to be reported within 24 hours to the sponsor, and 
notified to the IDMC (which is not blinded), together with full case details, within 48

[IP_ADDRESS]. Rationale for monitoring for spontaneous or excessive bleeding
During a study  carried out in adult subjects (RSV001), a mild non- clinically significant 
drop in hemoglobin was noted following vaccination with another adenoviral vector 
(PanAd3 -RSV) without clinical signs and with a reversal towards baseline values over 
time [ RSV001 Interim Study  Report , 2014]. In the repeat dose toxicology  study  in rab bits 
using the ChAd155 -RSV vaccine, a transient non -clinically  significant drop in platelets 
was noted post IM vaccination (maximal drop of platelet observed 24 hours after 
vaccination; refer to the current IB for further details). I n light of these data, subjects’ 
parent(s)/ legally  acceptable representative(s) (LAR[s]) will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_1275]/stud y staff if their child presents s ymptoms of spontaneous bleeding or eas y 
bruising or if their child develops a rash, within 30 days after either vaccination (Visit 1

blood samples for hematology /biochemistry  were taken from all subjects at all study  
visits, i.e., at Screening, on the day  of vaccination (Day  0 and Day  30), [ADDRESS_629391]

The safet y profile of the ChAd155 -RSV vaccine was found to be satisfactory  by [CONTACT_489737]. No safet y signal from the assessed hematology parameters (hemoglobin, platelet 
count, prothrombin time and APTT) was observed in subjects receiving the ChAd155 -
RSV vaccine. No significant reductions in platelet count or clinicall y significant changes 
in coagulation parameters were observed up to [ADDRESS_629395] Dose 2.
1.2.5. Rational e for study  blinding
Given the different appearance and storage conditions of the investigational RSV vaccine 
and the active control comparator vaccines / Placebo ,double blinding is not possible and 
the study  will be conducted in an observer- blind manner.
When all data up to Day  61 are available, a statistical anal ysis will be performed. This 
analysis may  lead to the unblinding of some subjects. As a consequence, after Day  61, the 
study  cannot be considered as observer -blind, but will be conducted in a single blind 
manner, with subjects’ parent(s)/ legally  acceptable representative(s) (LAR[s]) remaining 
blinded up to the last study  visit ( end of the second RSV transmission season*), while the 
investigator will still not have access to the treatment alloc ation up to the last study  visit 
(end of the second RSV transmission season ), except in case of emergency  unblinding 
(see Section 9.8).
*Refer to t he SPM for RSV seasons per country .
Please refer to the glossary  of terms for the definition of observer- blind and single blind.
1.2.6. Rationale for the use of controls
The comparator / Placebo group s are included as a control for the reactogenicity , safet y 
and immunogenicit y assessments. The choice of control between anactive comparator or 
Placebo will be done at country  level. Refer to the Informed Consent Form (ICF)for the 
local choice of comparator/Placebo.
Active comparators are included as a control for the reactogenicit y, safet y and 
immunogenicit y assessments. The choice of one of four control vaccines, as active 
comparators has been driven by  [CONTACT_49392], in most countries at least one of these 
vaccines meet the criteria of being of medical benefit, and where possible licensed for 
infants and used with a similar dose and schedule as the investigational RSV vaccine, 
while not being p art of a national immunization program. The choice of which active 
control comparator vaccine will be used will be done at the country  level and will be used 
according to its approved label.

ChAd155- RSV vaccine, whereas all infants will receive either an active control 
comparator vaccine ( Bexsero ,or Nimenrix, 
or Synflorix , or Menveo ), or Placebo (see 
Figure 1andTable 2).
The choice of active comparator vaccine or Placebo is done at the country  level.
Please refer to the current IB for the summary  of potential risks and benefits of 
ChAd155- RSV vaccine.
Please refer to the local Prescribing Information for information regarding the summary
of potential risks and benefits of Bexsero
,Nimenrix, Synflorix and Menveo.
The following section outlines the risk assessment and mitigation strategy  for this study  
protocol:
1.3.1. Risk A ssessment
As with all injectable vaccines, immediate s ystemic allergic reactions to vaccination can 
occur. In order to be able to treat infants with an immediate sy stemic allergic reaction to 
vaccination, all infants across all groups will need to remain under observation (visual 
follow -up as well as measurement of vital signs) at the study  site for at least 60 minutes 
after vaccination for Visit 1 and Visit 3 and 30 minutes for all remaining vaccination 
visits .
Intramuscular vaccination commonly precipi[INVESTIGATOR_14263] a transient and self -limiting local 
inflammatory  reaction. This may  typi[INVESTIGATOR_1306] y include pain at injection site, redness and 
swelling.

Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_629397] is 
thought to be very  low (refer to Section 1.2), this is the first time that this vaccine will be 
administered to subjects likely  to be unexposed to RSV. Consequently , all subjects will 
be closel y monitored b y active and passive surveillance for detection of RSV -RTI and 
wheezing (refer to Section 9.2). All cases of LRTI associated with RSV will be 
considered as AEs of special interest (refer to Section 9.1.5) and will have to be reported 
as SAEs (within 24 hours).
IM vaccination commonly  precipi[INVESTIGATOR_14263] a transient and self -limiting local inflammatory  
reaction. This may  typi[INVESTIGATOR_489602], swelling and tenderness.
Most sy stemic sy mptoms observed in a clinical trial with a similar product carried out in 
healthy  adults (chimpanzee adenovirus -based vaccine with ChAd3 as vector for 
vaccination against hepatitis C) at doses to be used in this trial did not exceed mild 
severit y [HCV001 Clinical Study  Report , 2011]. Fatigue, headache and malaise were the 
most commonly  reported sy stemic AEs overall.
In a Phase I clinical trial with a similar simian adenoviral vector -based RSV vaccine with 
the same insert (PanAd3 -RSV) carried out in healthy  adults, the most commonly  reported 
AEs concerned injection site reactions. However, a mild non- clinical ly significant drop in 
hemoglobin was noted following vaccination without clinical signs and with a reversal 
towards baseline values over time [ RSV001 Interim Study  Report , 2014].
A transient non -clinicall y significant drop in platelets was noted post IM vaccination in a 
preclinical stud y with the ChAd155- vector (refer to the current IB for further details). 
Furthermore, in Ebola Phase I studies in adults investigating a similar ade noviral 
vectored vaccine (ChAd3 -EBO -Z), transient non -clinically  significant decreases in 
thrombocy te counts were also observed (refer to the current IB of recombinant 
chimpanzee adenovirus Ty pe 3-
vectored Ebola Zaire vaccine for further details). A broad 
safet y hematology and biochemistry evaluation was performed at each study visit in 
adults during stud y RSV PED- 001 (201974) . In this study , no significant safety  concerns 
were identified up to [ADDRESS_629398] Dose 2 in healthy  adults aged 18 to 45 years (refe r to 
Section 1.1.7 and to the current IB) . Hematology  and biochemistry  parameters are also 
being intensivel y evaluated in RSV -seropositive infants a ged 12 to 23 months during 
study  RSV PED -002 (204838) .
Risks linked to the active control comparator vaccines
Refer to the local Prescribing Information for potential risks and contraindications related 
to Bexsero ,Nimenrix, Synflorix orMenveo vaccines.
1.3.2. Benefit A ssessment
The infants receiving the investigational ChAd155 -RSV vaccine may not directl y benefit 
from vaccination since the efficacy  of the investigational ChAd155- RSV vaccine has not 
been assessed yet and it is hence not known whether it is effe
ctive in protecting against 
RSV infection.

5.1. Number of subjects
The target will be to enroll approxima tely 150 infants likely  to be previously  unexposed 
to RSV with about 50 infants for each of three randomization groups. If necessary, the 
sample size may be increased through additional recruitment in order to achieve a 
sufficient number of RSV infected 
infants, with a negative RSV exposure status (at 
screening based on in -stream serological testing), in each RSV vaccine group. Dose [ADDRESS_629410] dos e (RSV seasons will be determined for each country  
based on local epi[INVESTIGATOR_489606]). The RSV season is 
defined as the period of the y
ear when 70% of the RSV cases have occurred in previous 
years. For the calculation, where ava ilable, data from up to the ten previous y ears should 
be applied. If the data permit calculation of the actual date of the beginning of the season, 
rather than approximation to the nearest month, this is desirable. Refer to the SPM for 
RSV seasons per coun try.Refer to Section 11.4 for the determination of sample size
(Amended [ADDRESS_629411] 2019).
Overview of the screening plan:
Upon completion of all screening procedures (refer to Table 7), the investigator will 
review the inclusion/exclusion criteria for each infant. I nfants meeting all eligibility  
criteria will be enrolled in the study . Their screening information will be recorded on the 
appropriate screen of eCRF.
If the investigator believes there is a reasonable reason to do so, screening procedures 
may be repeated once on ly. All screening procedures may  be repeated except the blood 
sampling for humoral response (neutralizing antibody  titers against RSV -A, RSV -F 
protein antibody  concentrations and palivizumab- competing antibody  concentrations).
5.2. Inclusion criteria for enrolm ent
Deviations from inclusion criteria are not allowed because they  can potentially  jeopardize 
the scientific integrit y, regulatory acceptability of the study or subject safety. Therefore, 
adherence to the criteria as specified in the protocol is essential.
All subjects must satisfy  ALL the following criteria at study  entry :
Subjects’ parent(s)/LAR(s) who, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], can and will 
comply  with the requirements of the protocol (e.g., completion of the diary  cards, 
return for f ollow -up visits).
Written informed consent obtained from the parent(s)/L AR(s) of the subject prior to 
performing an y stud y specific procedure.
A male or female between and including 6 and 7 months of age (from the day  the 
infant becomes 6 months of age until the day  before the infant achieves 8 months of 
age) at the time of the first vaccination.

6.2.1. Subject identification
Subject identification numbers will be assigned sequentially  to the subjects who have 
consented to participate in the study , according to the range of subject identification 
numbers allocated to each study  center.
6.2.2. Randomization of treatment
[IP_ADDRESS]. Randomization of supplies
The randomization of supplies within blocks will be performed at [COMPANY_004] Biologicals, using 
MATerial EXcellence (MATEX), a program developed for use in Statistical Anal ysis 
System (SAS®) (Cary , NC, [LOCATION_003]) by  [CONTACT_43055]. Entire blocks will be shipped to 
the study  centers /warehouse(s).
[IP_ADDRESS]. Treatment allocation to the subject
The treatment numbers will be allocated by [CONTACT_489742] .
[IP_ADDRESS].1. Study group and treatment n umber allocation
The target will be to enroll approximately  150 infants. Approximately  50 infants likely  to 
be previousl y unexposed to RSV will be randomly assigned to receive 2 doses at 0, 1 
month schedule of 0.5 mL of the ChAd155- RSV vaccine (5 x1010vp)[the 2DRSV + 
comparator group] , approximately  50 infants likely  to be previously  
unexposed to RSV 
will be randomly  assigned to receive a single dose of 0.5 mL of ChAd155- RSV vaccine 
(1.5x1010vp)[the 1D RSV + comparator group ], and approximately  50 infants likely  to 
be previousl y unexposed to RSV will be randomly assigned to receive 0.5 mL  of the

Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_629415] to a study  group at the i nvestigator site will be performed using 
a randomization sy stem on internet (SBIR) operated at the study  level.
The randomization algorithm will assign each subject to the 2 dose sof RSV vaccine + 
comparator group, thesingle dose of RSV vaccine + comparat or group, or its 
corresponding active control comparator group with the aim of keepi[INVESTIGATOR_489608] 2 dose RSV + comparator group, the pooled single dose RSV + comparator 
group and the pooled comparator group at 1:1:1 in the entire stud y (see Table 25for a 
description of pooled groups).
Countries will be grouped into five levels according to the choice of comparator vaccine 
or Placebo, t he randomization algorithm will use a minimization procedure accounting 
for country  as a minimization factor and the groupi[INVESTIGATOR_489609]/placebo as a 
stratification factor to attempt to maintain a 1:1:1 ratio as well within each level in the 
assignment of RSV + comparator vaccine versus comparator /Placebo control vaccine 
alone .
The actual randomization assignment the subject received ( to one of five 2 dose of RSV 
+ comparator vaccine groups, to one of five single dose of RSV + comparator vaccine 
groups, or to one of five comparator /Placebo control alone gr oups) will be able to be 
identified in SBI R.
After obtaining the signed and dated ICF from the subject’s parent(s)/LAR(s) and having 
checked the eligibility  of the subject, the delegated study  staff will access SBIR. Upon 
providing the subject identification number and the age, the randomization sy stem will 
determine the stud y group and will provide the treatment number to be used for the first 
dose.
The number of each administered treatment must be recorded in the eCRF on the Vaccine 
Administra tion screen.
When SBI R is not available, please refer to the SBIR user guide or the SPM for specific 
instructions.
[IP_ADDRESS].2. Treatment number allocation for subsequent doses
For each dose subsequent to the first dose, the delegated study  staff will access SBIR, 
provide the subject identification number, and the sy stem will provide a treatment 
number consistent with the allocated stud y group.
The number of each administered treatment must be recorded in the eCRF on the Vaccine 
Administration screen.

01-AUG -2019 716.3. Method of blinding
Data will be collected in an observer -blind manner. By  [CONTACT_43049]-blind, it is meant that 
during the course of the study , the vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_42973] y stud y endpoint (e.g., safet y, reactogenicit y) will all be unaware of 
which vaccine was administered. To do so, vaccine preparation and administration will 
be done b y authorized medical personnel who will not participate in an y of the study 
clinical evaluation assay s.
When all data up to Day  61 are available, a statistic al anal ysis will be performed. This 
analysis may  lead to the unblinding of some subjects. As a consequence, after Day  61, the 
study  cannot be considered as observer -blind, but will be conducted in a single blind 
manner, with subjects’ parent(s)/ LAR(s) rem aining blinded up to the last study  visit ( end 
of the second RSV transmission season ), while t he investigator will still not have access 
to the treatment allocation up to the last study  visit ( end of the second RSV transmission 
season ), except in case of e mergency  unblinding (see Section 9.8).
The laboratory  in charge of the laboratory  testing will be blinded to the treatment, and 
codes will be used t o link the subject and study  (without any  link to the treatment 
attributed to the subject) to each sample.
6.4. General study  aspects
Supplementary  study  conduct information not mandated to be present in this protocol is 
provided in the accompany ing SPM. The SP M provides the investigator and the site 
personnel with administrative and detailed technical information that does not impact the 
safet y of the subjects.
In the same investigational center, infants will be vaccinated sequentiall y, separated b y a 
minimum interval of 60 minutes.
Refer to Section 9.10 for information about limited vaccination, holding rules, safety
monitoring and safet y evaluation by [CONTACT_489743].

Nasal swab or other specimen for PCR assay collected during assessment visit
Real time assessment of potential RS V-LRTI cases is important for the timely monitoring 
of safet y.
If during passive or active surveillance contact, the investigator/study  staff assesses that 
an infant presents a potential RSV -RTI (refer to Section 9.2), a nasal swab or another 
specimen for assay  will be collected during an assessment visit:
The nasal swab will allow assessing the potential RSV infection by  [CONTACT_4503] -
PCR and respi[INVESTIGATOR_489617] (RVP) at sponsor laboratory .
The specimen for local assay  will allow assessing the potential RSV infection and 
RVP at a local routine laboratory , where available. The specimen type will depend 
on the assay  run locally .
Nasal swab collected for PCR assay to detect asymptomatic RSV infections
During RSV season, there will be monthly  nasal swabs to detect as ymptomatic RSV 
infections. These nasal swabs will allow assessing the pot ential RSV infection by  
[CONTACT_4503]-PCR performed centrall y at the sponsor laboratory . This swab may  be 
omitted upon investigator discretion if a swab has been taken for a s ymptomatic epi[INVESTIGATOR_489618] 4 weeks.
Refer to the SPM for more details about nasal swab.
6.6.13. Surveillance for RSV -RTI and wheezing
Surveillance period for RSV -RTI and wheezing will start at Visit 1 (after Dose 1) until 
the final visit (Visit 8 [ end of the second RSV transmission season ]). In order to timely  
detect RSV- RTI and to ensure cases are timely  captured by  [CONTACT_365196], both active 
and passive surveillance will be conducted as described in Section 9.2. Contacts f or 
active and passive surveillance will be recorded in the eCRF.
If an assessment visit is performed (refer to Section 9.2.4), this visit will be re corded in 
the eCRF, as well as signs and sy mptoms. Signs and sy mptoms to be recorded in the 
eCRF are listed in the SPM.

01-AUG -2019 87Determination of a negative RSV exposure status in infants at 6 to 7 months of age will 
be based on RSV A and/or B neutralizing antibody  titers present in serum at screening 
(before vaccination w ith the RSV vaccine) based on in- stream baseline serological 
testing. At birth, newborns do show positive for neutralizing antibodies due to maternal 
transfer during gestation. The titer of these antibodies declines over time. At the age of [ADDRESS_629439] experienced a recent RSV infection. This cut- off will thus 
allow the discrimination between a negative RSV exposure status versus RSV infected 
infants before start of vaccination. 
The following laboratory assay s are planned:
Functional (neutralizing) antibody  titers against RSV -A will be measured by  a 
neutralization assay  on serum samples ( Table 10).
RTI will be assessed by :
Quantitative RT-PCR that is able to discriminate RSV -A and RSV -B subty pes 
(Table 11).
Qualitative multiplex PCR for detection of a panel of viruses ( Table 11).
Local RSV assay , and /orlocal RVP where available ( Table 11)(Amended [ADDRESS_629440] 2019) .
Final confirmation of R SV presence will be obtained through the definitive results from 
the central test. 
These assay s will be performed at the investigator’s laboratory , at [COMPANY_004] Biologicals’ 
laboratory  or at laboratory  designated by  [CONTACT_43055] (refer to Table 10and Table

An AE can therefore be any  unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporall y associated with 
the use of a medicinal product. For marketed medicinal pro ducts, this also includes 
failure to produce expected benefits (i.e., lack of efficacy ), abuse or misuse.
Examples of an AE include:
Significant or unexpected worsening or exacerbation of the condition/indication 
under study .
Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency  and/or intensity  of the condition.
New conditions detected or diagnosed after stud y vaccines administration even 
though they  may  have been present prior to the start of the study .
Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction.
Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study  
vaccines or a concurrent medication (overdose per se should not be reported as an 
AE/SAE).
Signs, sy mptoms temporally  associated with study  vaccines administration.
Pre-or post -treatment events that occur as a result of protocol- mandated procedures 
(i.e., invasive procedures, modification of subject’s previous therapeutic regimen).

d.Results in disability /incapacity ,
Note: The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability  to 
conduct normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include experiences

01-AUG -2019 112The investigator will assess the maximum intensity that occurred over the duration of the 
event for all unsolicited AEs (including SAEs) recorded during the stud y. The assessment 
will be based on the investigator’s clinical judgement.
The intensity  should be assigned to one of the following categories:
1 (mild) =An AE which is easil y tolerated b y the subject, causing minimal 
discomfort and not interfering with every day activities.
2 (moderate) =An AE which is sufficiently  discomforting to interfere with 
normal every day activities.
3 (severe) =An AE which prevents normal, every day activities. Such an AE 
would, for example, prevent attendance at school/kindergarten/a 
day-care centre and would cause the parent(s)/LAR(s) to s eek 
medical advice. 
An AE that is assessed as Grade 3 (severe) should not be confused with a SAE. Grade 
3 is a category  used for rating the intensit y of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be 
assessed as Grade 3. An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets one of the pre -
defined outcomes as described in Section 9.1.2.
[IP_ADDRESS].2. Assessment of causality
The investigator is obligated to assess the relations hip between stud y vaccines and the 
occurrence of each AE/SAE using clinical judgement. 
Alternative plausible causes, such as natural history of the underl ying diseases, 
concomitant therap y, other risk factors, and the temporal relationship of the event to the 
study  vaccines will be considered and investigated. The investigator will also consult the 
IB to determine his/her assessment.
There may  be situations when a SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial repor t to [COMPANY_004] Biologicals. However, it is very  
important that the investigator alway s makes an assessment of causality  for every  event 
prior to submission of the Expedited Adverse Events Report to [COMPANY_004] Biologicals. The 
investigator may  change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_19954] -up information and 
update the SAE information accordingl y. The causality assessment is one of the criteria 
used when determining regulatory  reporting requirements.
All solicited local (injection site) reactions will be consider ed causall y related to 
vaccination. Causality of all other AEs should be assessed by [CONTACT_159290]:

01-AUG -2019 1189.7. Unblinding
[COMPANY_004] Biologicals’ policy  (which incorporates ICH E2A guidance, EU Clinical Trial 
Directive and US Federal Regulations) is to unblind the report of an y SAE which is 
unexpected and attributable/suspected to be attributable to the study  vaccines, prior to 
regulatory  reporting. The [COMPANY_004] Biologicals’ Central Safet y Physician is responsible for 
unblinding the treatment assignment in accordance with the specified timeframes for 
expedited reporting of SAEs (refer to Section 9.4.1 ).
9.8. Emergency  unblinding
Unblinding of a subject’s individual treatment code should occur onl y in the case of a 
medical emergency , or in the event of a serious medical condition, when kno wledge of 
the treatment is essential for the clinical management or welfare of the subject, as judged 
by [CONTACT_093].
The emergency  unblinding process consists of the automated sy stem SBIR that allows the 
investigator to have unrestricted, immediate a nd direct access to the subject’s individual 
study  treatment.
The investigator has the option of contact[CONTACT_30697] a [COMPANY_004] Biologicals’ On -call Central Safet y 
Physician (or Backup) if he/she needs medical advice or needs the support of [COMPANY_004] to 
perform the unblinding (i.e., he/she cannot access SBI R).
Any emergency  unblinding must be full y documented by [CONTACT_43086], which must be appropriatel y completed by  [CONTACT_489755] 24 hours to [COMPANY_004] Biologicals.

The investigator (or designate) must therefore provide a “subject card” to each subject’s 
parent(s)/LAR(s). In an emergency situation this card serves to inform the responsible 
attending ph ysician that the subject is in a clinical study  and that relevant information 
may be obtained by  [CONTACT_21947].
Subjects’ parent(s)/LAR(s) must be instructed to keep subject cards in their possession at 
all times during the stud y duration.
9.10. Holding rules and safety monitoring
The investigation al ChAd155
-RSV vaccine has never been administered to RSV -
potentially  naïve infants. Safety  precautions such as limited vaccination, safety  
evaluations by  [CONTACT_489756], and study  holding rules have therefore been 
defined.
9.10.1. Limited vaccination
In the same investigational center, all the infants should be vaccinated sequentially  and at 
least 60 minutes apart to allow monitoring of an y acute events (e.g., h ypersensitivity  
reaction). All infants should be closely  observed (visual follow -up as well as 
measurement of vital signs) for at least 60 minutes after vaccination. Vital signs are body  
temperature, HR and RR. Vital signs are preferably  measured when the infant is calm.
9.10.2. Internal safety  review committee (iSRC) oversight
This study  will be overseen by  [CONTACT_489757] a charter. An iSRC was already  
involved in study  RSV PED -002 (204838). Core members of the iSRC will include a 
[COMPANY_004] Biologicals’ safet y physician, a CRDL , and a biostatistician who are not otherwise 
involved in the conduct of the proj ect. The iSRC safet y reviews will be conducted using 
unblinded data. The iSRC has access to the subject randomization and reviews unblinded 
data.
The iSRC will review all accumulating safet y and reactogenicity data four weeks after 
the start of vaccination and then every  4 weeks until all dosing with ChAd155- RSV 
vaccine is complete on the study . The iSRC members will determine if a safety  signal 
should be escalated to the VSMB .The iSRC members will determine whether an y of the 
predefined holding rules are met (refer to Section 9.10.4
) or if there is an y other safet y 
signal. In this case, vaccination in the study  will be immediately  put on hold (refer to 
Section 9.10.5).

9.10.3. Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) oversight
This study  will be overseen by  [CONTACT_489758] a charter. The IDMC involved 
in the present study  was already  involved in study RSV PED -002 (204838). Overall, the 
role of the IDMC includes the review and protection of data integrit y and rights and 
safet y of stud y participants throughout the stud y period . It will provide initial, regular, 
and closing advice to [COMPANY_004] Biologicals on medical, ethical, scientific and safety -related 
issues . Its advice will be based on the interpretation of study  data with reference to the 
study  protocol.
The IDMC will review the protocol and statistical anal ysis plan. Meetings will be 
documented and minutes of open sessions of the IDMC meetings made availab le to the 
sponsor. The IDMC may, if deemed necessary , convene a meeting with, or request 
further information from the principal investigators and [COMPANY_004] Biologicals’ designated 
project representatives at any  stage of the study .
The IDMC may  recommend to the sponsor to suspend the enrolment to the study  and/or 
vaccination based on their review of safety  data arising in this study  
(refer to Section 
9.10.4).
The IDMC safety  reviews will be conducted using unblinded data. The IDMC will 
review all available safety  data while taking into account any  other findings that could 
have an impact on the safety  of the subjects.
The IDMC members will determine whether an y of the predefined stud y holding rules 
are met (refer to Section 9.10.4) or if there is an y other safet y signal. If this is the case, 
vaccination in the stud y will be immediately  put on hold. If no safet y signal is observed,

allow detection of a serious ERD signal having a magnitude similar to that of the historic
FI-RSV vaccine trials [Kim, 1969] . A total of 150 infants will be enrolled and 
randomized with 1:1:1 ratio to receiv eeither 1 dose of the 1. 5x1010vp/dose ChAd-155 
RSV vaccine [the 1D RSV + comparator group ], 2 doses of the 5x1010vp/dose ChAd-
155 RSV vaccine [the 2D RSV + comparator group] , or no ChAd- 155 RSV vaccine [the 
comparator/Placebo control alone group ].

Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_629490] 50% of subjects [ Dunn , 2013] w ill have a negative RSV exposure status (at 
screening which will be assessed by [INVESTIGATOR_2993]-stream serological testing of baseline samples
). 
While the rate of RSV infection could be highl y variable b y season, a conservative rate of 
infection of 20% in the first season is assumed [Kutsay a, 2016 ]. Therefore, wi th [ADDRESS_629491] 5 infected infants 
with a negative RSV exposure status (at screening based on in-stream baseline 
serological testing) in each 
RSV vaccine group [50×
0.5×0.2=5 ].
With a one -sided ty pe I error of 0.05, and the assumption of a 10% rate of infection 
progressing to very  severe RS V-
LRTI (which is a conservative assumption based on the 
rate in the natural history of disease ),[ADDRESS_629492] 90% statistical 
power to demonstrate the progression rate from infection to very  severe RS V-LRTIis 
less than 80% . That is less extreme than that observed in thehistoric FI -RSV vaccine trial 
where 80% of RSV RTI cases progress edto hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] [ Kim, 1969]. During the 
course of the stud y, since the actual negative RSV exposure status (at screening based on 
in-stream baseline 
serological testing) and infection rates may be lower than 50% and 
20%, respectively , the sample size may be adjusted as need edthrough additional 
recruitment in order to achieve a sufficient number of RSV infected infants with a
n
egative RSV exposure status (at screening based on in -stream baseline serological 
testing )
in each RSV vaccine group (Amended [ADDRESS_629493] 2019) . 
If a maximum of 1 out of 5 infections in infants receiving ChAd -155 RSV vaccine 
progress to very  severe RS V-LRTI, then it can be concluded with 95% confidence that 
the expected progression rate o f infection is less than the effect reported in previous FI -
RSV trials; if a minimum of 3 out of 5 infections progress to very  severe RS V-LRTI then 
it can be concluded with 95% confidence that the expected progression rate of infection is 
more than the 10% observed in natural history  of infection. The above power anal ysis is 
based on the procedure of inequality  of one proportion in PASS 12. 
With [ADDRESS_629494] one 
SAE would be about 92% if the true incidence rate of SAE is 5%. For estimating the 
proportion of subjects with AEs, the maximum width of exact 95% confidence interval 
(CI) would be under 30%, and it could be as large as 35% if attrition rate is 30%.
Figure 6illustrates the precision on the estimate for the proportion of subjects with AEs 
following vaccination with each RSV formulation based on the number of subjects with
AEs observed from 50 sub jects.

Any missing or non- evaluable immunogenicity  measurement will not be replaced:
For the within- group assessment, the descriptive anal ysis performed for each assay  at 
each timepoint will ex clude subjects with a missing or non -evaluable measurement. 
Kinetics will be plotted on subjects with results available at all timepoints.
The geometric mean titers/concentrations (GMTs/GMCs) will be computed by  [CONTACT_55418]-logarithm of the arithmetic mean of the log10 transformed titers/concentrations.
A seronegative subject will be defined as a subject whose antibody  titer/concentration is 
below the cut -off value of the assay . A seropositive subject is a subject whose antibody  
titer/concentration is g reater than or equal to the cut -off value of the assay .
Determination of a negative RSV exposure status in infants at 6 to 7 months of age will 
be based on RSV A and/or B neutralizing antibody  titers present in serum at screening 
(before vaccination with t he RSV vaccine) based on in- stream baseline serological 
testing. At birth, newborns do show positive for neutralizing antibodies due to maternal 
transfer during gestation. The titer of these antibodies declines over time. At the age of [ADDRESS_629499] experienced a recent RSV infection. This cut- off will thus 
allow the discr imination between a negative RSV exposure status versus RSV infected 
infants before start of vaccination.

11.11. Interpretation of analy ses
For the occurrence of very  severe RSV-LRTI among RSV infected infants with a
n
egative RSV exposure status (at screening based on in -stream baseline serological 
testing
) from first vaccination (Day  1) up to the end of the first RSV transmission season, 
if the upper bound aryofthe95% one -sided lower CI of the rate is under 80%, it indicates 
that the very  severe RS V
-LRTI rate is less than that of the historic RSV -FI tria ls [Kim, 
1969].
Comparative anal yses will be exploratory  and should be interpreted with caution 
considering that there is no adjustment for multiplicity  and that group sizes are small for

01-AUG -2019 [ZIP_CODE].12.1. Sequence of analy ses
In preparation of th e planned iSRC and I DMC evaluations, analy ses of all available 
safet y data (i.e., data that are as clean as possible) will be performed (see Section 9.10 for 
more information). These anal yses will be done by  [CONTACT_489780] , and will be documented in a statistical anal ysis 
report. Onl y the outcome of the iSRC and I DMC reviews will be communicated to the 
RSV study  team (no safety  signal or safet y signal). No clinical study report will be 
written (Amended [ADDRESS_629511] 2019) .
The statistical anal yses will be performed in 3steps:
An anal ysis will be performed when a ll data up to Day 61 are available. Additional 
safet y data available at the time of this anal ysis will be described. At this point, the 
statistician will be unblinded (i.e., individual subject treatment assignments will be 
available) and the stud y will be conducted in a single blind manner, with patients 
remaining blinded up to the last study  visit ( end of the second RSV transmission 
season ). Summary  results may  unblind some specific subjects but no individual 
listings will be provided and the investigator will not have access to the treatment 
allocation up to the last study  visit ( end of the second RSV transmission season ), 
except in case of emergency  unblinding (see Section 9.8).
An anal ysis will be performed when all data up to Visit 7 ( end of the first RSV 
transmission season) are available. No individual listings will be provided.
The final analy sis will be performed when all data up to study  conclusion (end of the 
second RSV transmission season) are available. An integrated clinical study  report 
containing all data will be written and made available to the investigators at that 
time.
If the data for tertiary  endpoints become available at a later stage, (an) additional 
analysis/ anal yses will be performed. These data will be documented in annex(es) to the 
study  report and will be made available to the investigators at that time.
11.12.2. Statistical considerations for interim analyses
No interim anal yses are planned.

inspection), and must be available for review in conjunction with assessment of the 
facility , supporting s ystems, and staff. Where permitted by  [CONTACT_5751]/regulations or 
institutional policy , some or all of these records can be maintained in a validated format 
other than hard copy (e.g., microfiche, scanned, electronic); however, caution needs to be 
exercised before such action is taken. The investigator must ensure that all reproductions 
are legible and are a true and accurate cop y of the original and meet accessibility  and 
retrieval standards, including re -generating a hard copy, if required. Furthermore, the 
investigator must ensure that an acceptable back -up of the reproductions exists and that 
there is an acceptable quality  control procedure in place for making these reproductions.
[COMPANY_004] will inform the investigator/institution of the time period for retaining these records 
to comply  with all applicable regulatory  requireme nts. The minimum retention time will 
meet the strictest standard applicable to a particular site, as dictated b y ICH GCP, any  
institutional requirements, applicable laws or regulations, or [COMPANY_004] standards/procedures, 
otherwise, the minimum retention period w ill default to 25 y ears after completion of the

The serum neutralization assay  is a functional assay  that measures the ability  of serum 
antibodies to neutralize RSV entry  and replication in a host cell line.
Virus neutralization is performed by  [CONTACT_117838] a fixed amount of RSV -A strain ( Long,
ATCC No. VR -26) with serial dilutions of the test serum. Then, the serum -virus mixture 
is transferred onto a monolay er of Vero cells (African Green Monkey , kidney , 
Cercopi[INVESTIGATOR_227203], ATCC CCL -81) and incubated for three day s to allow infec tion of 
Vero cells by  [CONTACT_105]- neutralized viruses and the formation of plaques in the cell monolay er. 
Following the fixation period, RSV -infected cells are detected using a primary  antibody  
directed against RSV (anti -RSV IgG) and a secondary  antibody  conjugate d with horse -
radish peroxidase (HRP) , allowing the visualization of plaques after coloration with 
TrueBlue peroxidase substrate .Viral plaques are counted using an automated 
microscope coupled to an image anal yzer (Scanlab sy stem with Axiovision software). For 
each serum dilution, a ratio, expressed as a percentage, is calculated between the number 
of plaques at that dilution and the number of plaques in the virus control wells (no serum 
added). The serum neutralizing antibody  titer is expressed in ED60 (Estimated Dilution 
60) and corresponds to the inverse of the interpolated serum dilution that y ields a 60% 
reduction in the number of plaques compared to the virus control wells as described b y 
others [ Barbas , 1992; Bates , 2014].
ELISA
Anti- RSV protein F ELISA
The anti -F protein IgG ELISA is an indirect ELISA allowing the detection and the 
quantitation of specific IgG antibodies directed against the RSV F protein in human 
serum samples. PreF antigen will be adsorbed onto a [ADDRESS_629525]. The 
corresponding antibody concentration, corrected for the dilution factor, is 
expressed in arbitrary ELISA Laboratory Units per milliliter (ELU/mL).

Palivizumab monoclona l antibody  (Synagis) is used as a passive treatment that 
protects against RSV infection by  [CONTACT_489783][INVESTIGATOR_489673] 
F antigen. 
First, F protein antigens purified from CHO expression sy stem are coated onto [ADDRESS_629526] are 
added in sequence with competitor antibodies (horseradish peroxidase -conjugated 
palivizumab) and incubated to allow specific binding of antibodies directed against 
the F protein antigens. If palivizumab-like antibodies are present in serum samples, 
they will compete with the horseradish peroxidase -conjugated palivizumab 
antibodies for binding to the F prote in coated antigen. After a washing step, the 
horseradish peroxidase substrate solution (TMB/H 2O2) is added and a colored 
product develops in a manner that is inversel y proportional to the amount of 
palivizumab -like antibodies contained in the test serum. T he color is quantified by  
[CONTACT_489784] [ADDRESS_629527] curve using a four
-parameter equatio n and are 
expressed as palivizumab- equivalent antibodies in microgram per millilitre (µg/mL).
Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT- PCR)
Quantitative RT-PCR able to discriminate RSV- A and RSV -B subt ypes:
Briefl y, RSV A and RSV B RNAs extracted from the nasal swabs are detected in a 
duplex PCR format using specific amplification primers and fluorescent probes 
designed in the RSV N gene, encoding the RSV nucleocapsid protein. The process 
involves nucleic acids extraction, conversion of R NA to complementary  
deox
yribonucleic acid b y reverse transcription and detection b y real -time PCR 
reaction using a calibration curve (absolute quantitation). The RSV viral load is 
reported as copi[INVESTIGATOR_333946].
Qualitative multiplex RT-PCRfor detection of a panel of viruses:
A qualitative PCR multiplex assay  is used for the detection and identification of 
multiple respi[INVESTIGATOR_489674]. The following virus types and subty pes can be identified 
in the assay :
Influenza A virus (Flu A)
Influenza B virus (Flu B)
Human Influenza A virus subty pe H1 (Flu A -H1)
Human Influenza A virus subty pe H3 (Flu A -H3)
Human Influenza A virus subty pe H1pdm09 (Flu A -H1pdm09)

Amendment number: Amendment 1
Amendment date: 16 July  2018
Co-ordinating author:  (Scientific Writer )
Rationale/background for changes:
In response to feedback from regulatory  authorities, this study  will evaluate two 
regimens of the ChAd155- RSV vaccine: either one dose or two doses will be 
given and the study  sample size has been adjusted accordingl y. The one dose 
regimen will administer a single vaccination with a lower dose of 1.5x1010viral 
particles (vp) while the two dose regimen will administer 5x1010vp for both 
vaccinations with a one month interval between doses. Unless th e higher 5x1010vp 
dose is not well -tolerated in subjects 12 -23 months of age in the ongoing study  
204838 (RSV PED -002),we intend to study  this high dose as a [ADDRESS_629538].
The meningococcal vaccine NeisVac -Cwas removed and the pneumo coccal 
polysaccharide conjugate vaccine Synflorix was added as one of the potential 
active comparator vaccines to be considered in countries where it is currently  
licensed.
A placebo group was added to accommodate this request from countries that were 
not able to identify  a suitable active comparator.
A cross -reference to the Informed Consent Form (ICF) was added for the local 
choice of comparator/placebo (Sections 1.2.6 and 3).
Serological testing of baseline samples to determine exposure status will be 
performed in -stream to ensure at least 50% of subjects with a negative RSV 
exposure status at screening based on in -stream baseline serological testing. The 
sample size will be adjusted as needed through additional recruitment. The 
discussion on sample size determination has been simplified and assumptions have 
been further justified (Section 11.4)

The purpose of this study is to provide critical information on 
the safet y, reactogenicity and immunogenicit y profile of the 
ChAd155- RSV vaccine in infants likely  to be unexp osed to 
RSV before moving to a dose selection and a proof -of-
concept trial in infants. This An important aspect of this

infants aged 6 and 7 months, likely  to be unexposed to RSV ,
associated with the ChAd155- historic FI-RSV vaccine trials .
(Amended 16 July 2018)
Rationale for the study design
Study population: The immunogenicit y, safet y and 
reactogenicity of the pediatric candidate RSV vaccine 
(ChAd155- RSV vaccine) has been evaluated in healthy  adults 
aged 18 to 45 years (study 201974 [RSV PED -001; 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]]). A clinical study  is currentl y being 
conducted in RSV -seropositive infants aged 12 to 23 months 
(study  204838 [RSV PED -002]). The safety  profile of the 
ChAd155- RSV vaccine in adults (study  201974 [RSV PED -
001; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]]) has been evaluated and determined to 
besatisfactory  by [CONTACT_489787] (I DMC). At the condition of Should there be a
satisfactory  safet y profile of the ChAd155- RSV vaccine in 
RSV -seropositive infants, as evaluated b y an IDMC on Day  
60 data (i.e., Day [ADDRESS_629540] dose 
level) of the stud y RSV PED -002, the present study  will be 
performed. This study  will be conducted onin infants aged 6 
and 7 months, ( having a low chance of natural exposure to 
RSV before inclusion in the study ,).The primary analysis for 
incidence of LRTI will be conducted i n infants with a 
negative RSV exposure status (at screening based on in -
stream baseline serological testing). This study will support 
the decision to allow age de -escalat ioneto the targeted 
population (infants as from 6 weeks of age ).) in the 
subsequent s tudy.
Control vaccine s: Active controls: Active 
controls comparators are included as a control for the 
reactogenicity , safet y and immunogenicit y assessments. The 
choice of one of four meningococcal control vaccines, as 
active comparators has been driven b y the fact that, in most 
countries at least one of these vaccines meet the criteria of 
being of medical benefit, and where possible licensed for 
infants and used with a similar dose and schedule as the 
investigational RSV vaccine, while not being part of a 
national immunization program. The choice of which active 
control meningococcal comparator vaccine willtobe used will
be done at the country  level and will be used according to its 
approved label.
To provide benefit to all trial participants and to maintain the 
study  blind until the end of follow up, the ChAd155 -RSV

of the RSV cases have occurred in previous years. For the 
calculation, where available, data from up to the ten previous 
years should be applied. If the data permi t calculation of the 
actual date of the beginning of the season, rather than 
approximation to the nearest month, this is desirable).

following change swasmade:
In general, animal models suggest that the immunopathology  seen with the FI -RSV 
vaccine was a result of a poor functional antibod y response [ Graham , 2011; Openshaw, 
2002] An unbalanced cellular immune response skewed towards Th2 (disturbed Th1/Th2 
balance) could also beobserved in mouse models [Connors, 1992; Connors, 1994; Waris, 
1996], but is not consistently  supported b y data from other mod el animals [Antonis, 
2003; Castilow , 2008; Phipps, 2007].
The Section 1.1.6. Pre -clinical experience .the following statement was added :
Please refer to the current IB for information regarding the pre -clinical studies of [COMPANY_004] 
Biologicals’ investigational ChAd155- RSV  vaccine.
The Section 
1.1.7. Clinical experience ,the following statement was amended
:
Please refer to the current IB for information regarding the pre- clinical and clinical
studies of GlaxoSmithKline ([COMPANY_004]) Biologicals’ investigational ChAd155 -RSV vaccine.
The Section 1.2.1. Rationale for the study ,the following changes were made:
The purpose of this stud y is to provide critical information on the safet y, reactogenicity 
and immunogenicit y profile of the ChAd155 -RSV vaccine in infants likely  to be 
unexposed to RSV before moving to a dose-selection and a proof -of-concept trial in 
infants. This An important aspect of this phase I/II study  will be to compare a single 
lower dose of 1.5x1010viral particles (vp) and two higher doses of 5x1010vp according 
to a 0, 1 month schedule administered to infants aged 6 and 7 months likely to be 
unexposed to RSV, which is powered to statistically exclude a level of risk of ‘vaccine -
induced enhanced RSV disease’ after vaccination of infants aged 6 and 7 months, likely  
to be unexposed to RSV ,associated with the ChAd155- historic FI-RSV vaccine trials in 
young infants [Kim , 1969 ].
The Section [IP_ADDRESS]. Study population , the following changes were made:
The immunogenicit y, safety  and reactogenicit y of the pediatric candidate RSV vaccine 
(ChAd155- RSV vaccine) has been evaluated in healthy  adults aged 18 to 45 years (study  
201974 [RSV PED -001; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]]). A clinical study  is currentl y being conducted 
in RSV -seropositive infants aged 12 to 23 months (study  204838 [RSV PED -002]). The 
safet y profile of the ChAd155 -RSV vaccine in adults (study  201974 [RSV PED -001; 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]]) has been evaluated satisfactory  by [CONTACT_269395] (I DMC). 
At the condition of Should there be a satisfactory  safety  profile of 
the ChAd155- RSV vaccine in RSV -seropositive infants, as evaluated b y an IDMC on 
Day 60 data (i.e., Day [ADDRESS_629555] dose level) of the study  RSV 
PED -002, the present study  will be performed. This study  will be conducted on infants 
aged 6 and 7 months (having a low chance of natural exposure to RSV before inclusion in
the study ),). The primary analysis for incidence of LRTI will be conducted in infants 
with a negative RSV exposure status (at screening based on in-stream serological 
testing ). This study will support the decision to allow age de -escalat ioneto the targeted 
population (infants as from 6 weeks of age).

01-AUG -2019 174The Section [IP_ADDRESS]. Choice of study population ,the following change wasmade:
Infants of this age are more likely  to be unexposed to RSV compared to older infants. 
Most of the infants (50% to 70%) are estimated to be RSV -exposed at one y ear of age.
[Dunn , 2013] .
The Section [IP_ADDRESS]. In-stream serological testing of baseline samples to determine 
exposure status ,was added:
Subjects will not be screened for serostatus as criterion for enrolment in the study, due 
to the potential presence and detection of residual maternal antibodies (Refer to 
Section 6.7.3 for more details on the determination of a negative RSV exposure status). 
The assumption is that the majority of infants are previously unexpo sed (see Section 
[IP_ADDRESS]). Serological testing of baseline samples to determine exposure status will be 
performed in -stream to ensure at least 50% of infants with a negative RSV exposure 
status (at screening based on in-stream baseline serological testing )and the sample 
size will be adjusted as needed through additional recruitment (Section 11.4).
The Section 1.2.3. Rationale for regimen, dose and route of administration ,was 
amended as follows:
A vaccination regimen based on This study will evaluate two IM injections (in the 
anterolateral thigh) of 5 x 1010viral particles (vp) regimens of the ChAd155- RSV
vaccine ;either one dose of 1.5x1010vpor two doses of 5x1010vp will be administered
according to a 0, 1 -month . For the two dose schedule (4 -week an in terval of 
approximately one month between vaccinations) dosing will be evaluatedused. A single 
dose arm was added in this study . This dose level is the same as the highest dose 6-[ADDRESS_629556] previously been administered to RSV -

Using a different adenovector, PanAd3, the 5 x 1010vp dose regimen was shown to be 
safe in toxicology  studies in mice. Preclinical data in different species (mice, cotton rats, 
non-human primates, and seronegative newborn calves) have shown that this regi men 
induces both anti -RSV F neutralizing antibodies and sy stemic T- cell responses [Taylor, 
2015; Pi[INVESTIGATOR_489694], 2015 ].

In the Section [IP_ADDRESS].Rationale for RSV disease surveillance the following paragraph 
was deleted:
Subjects will not be screened for serostatus as criterion for enrolment in the study , due to 
the potential presence and detection of residual maternal antibodies. The assumption is 
that the majority  of infants are previousl y unexposed (see Section ). Infants will be 
administered with Dose 1 of the ChAd155-RSV vaccine before the RSV season and then 
followed up through the RSV season.
The Section 1.2.5. Rationale for study blinding , was amende d as follows:
Given the different appearance and storage conditions of the investigational RSV vaccine 
and the active control comparator vaccines / saline solution Placebo, double blinding is 
not possible and the study  will be conducted in an observer -blind manner.

Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_629561] been made:
Active comparatorsThe comparator / Placebo groups are included as a control for the 
reactogenicity, safety and immunogenicity assessments. The choice of control between 
an active comparator or Placebo will be done at country level. Refer to the Informed 
Consent Form (ICF) for the local choice of comparator/P lacebo.
Active comparators are included as a control for the reactogenicity, safety and 
immunogenicity assessments. The choice of one of four meningococcal control vaccines, 
as active comparators has been driven b y the fact that, in most countries at least one of 
these vaccines meet the criteria of being of medical benefit, and where possible licensed 
for infants and used with a similar dose and schedule as the investigational RSV vaccine, 
while not being part of a national immunization program. The choice o f which active 
control meningococcal comparator vaccine will be used will be done at the country  level 
and will be used according to its approved label.
Since the immunization schedule for the meningococcal active comparator vaccines for 
infants between [ADDRESS_629562] dose of the 
investigational RSV vaccine (for either Menveo orSynflorix) or the second dose of the 
investigational RSV vaccine (for either Bexsero or Nimenrix or NeisVac -C). To

follows :
1Visit [ADDRESS_629585] no longer than 30 days after the Screening visit. When applicable, a re -screening visit may 
be scheduled at any time (but only once to assess eligibility ; blood for humoral response will notbe re- sampled).
All screening procedur es need to be performed within [ADDRESS_629586] RSV season at 
Visit 7 (refer to Figure 1and Table 2 ).
In Section 6.6.11. Study vaccines administration ,the following change ha sbeen made:
The subjects will be observed closel y (visual follow -up as well as measurement of resting 
vital signs) for at least 60 minutes following the administration of the vaccines at Visit 1 
and Visit 3, with appropriate medical treatment readily  available in case of anaph ylaxis. 
Vital signs are body temperature, HR and RR. Vital signs are preferabl y measured when 
the infant is calm. After administration of comparator vaccines or saline FBat Visit 5, 
Visit 6 and Visit 7, the subjects will be observed closely  (visua l follow -up as well as 
measurement of resting vital signs) for at least 30 minutes following the administration of 
the vaccines, with appropriate medical treatment readily  available in case of anaphy laxis.

During RSV season, there will be monthly  nasal swabs to detect as ymptomatic RSV 
infections. These n asal swabs will allow assessing the potential RSV infection by  
[CONTACT_4503]-PCR atperformed centrally atthe sponsor laboratory . This swab may  be

01-AUG -2019 194** If during passive or active surveillance contact, the investigator/study staff assesses that an infant presents a 
potential RSV -RTI (refer to Table 6 for defini tion), the potential RSV infection will be assessed by [CONTACT_4503]-
PCR of nasal swab specimens taken at an assessment visit.
*** During RSV season, there will be monthly nasal swabs to detect asymptomatic RSV infections. These swabs will be 
tested by q uantitative RT-PCR at sponsor laboratory.
These assays will be performed only on enrolled infants .and samples from non -enrolled subjects will be 
discarded .
In Section 6.7.3. Laboratory assays ,the following change s havebeen made:
Determination of a neg
ative RSV exposure status in infants at 6 to 7 months of age will 
be based on RSV A and/or B neutralizing antibody titers present in serum at screening 
(before vaccination with the RSV vaccine) based on in -stream baseline serological 
testing. At birth, newborns do show positive for neutralizing antibodies due to maternal 
transfer during gestation. The titer of these antibodies declines over time. At the age of 
[ADDRESS_629591] experienced a recent RSV infection. This cut -off will thus 
allow the discrimination betwee n a negative RSV exposure status versus RSV infected 
infants before start of vaccination.
The following laboratory assay s are planned:
Functional (neutralizing) antibody  titers against RSV -A will be measured by  a 
neutralization assay  on serum samples ( Table 10).
RSV F protein antibody  concentrations and palivizumab- competing antibody  
concentrations will be determined by [INVESTIGATOR_2993]-house ELISA on serum sample.
RTI will be assessed by :
Quantitative RT-PCR that is able to discriminate RSV -A and RSV -B subty pes 
(Table 11).
Qualitative multiplex PCR for detection of a panel of viruses ( Table 11).
Local RSV assay , and local RVP where available ( Table 11).
Final confirmation of RSV presence will be obtained through the definitive results 
from the central test.

Minimizing environmental contamination with genetically modified organisms
Each product will be used in accordance with the local applicable genetically  modified 
organism regulations.
To minimize release of the recombinant vectored vaccine virus into the environment, 
each vaccine is produced under good manufacturing practice conditions with the handling 
of live material in appropriate laboratory facilities. This is to ensure that any  release of 
modified organism is containe d, inactivated and incinerated, using single use equipment 
as much as possible, to avoid release of modified genetic material into the environment.

:
Refer to APPENDIX Dfor the symptoms and grading for assessment visits and 
worsening visits.
In Section 9.2.1. Passive surveillance ,the following change wasmade:
All subjects’ parent(s)/LAR(s) will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_1697]/study  staff in 
case of an y new or worsened RTI symptoms (cough, runny nose or blocked nose) or in 
case of an y new difficul ty in breathing or wheezing. They  will be also reminded to record 
the start date and the end date of the RTI s ymptoms on the RTI  epi[INVESTIGATOR_489611].
In Section 9.2.2. Surveillance for asymptomatic RSV- RTI,the following change swere
made:
In order to detect as ymptomatic RSV -RTI, monthly  nasal swabs for anal ysis at sponsor 
laboratory  will be performed for all subjects during the RSV season .who are ‘RTI 
symptom free’ within an approximate 30 day period . Upon investigators discretion this, 
the asymptomatic visit may be omitted if a nasal swab has been taken for a potential 
disease epi[INVESTIGATOR_459752] 4 weeks . This (please refer to the SPM for an example 
of when to schedule the visit). The asymptomatic nasal swab will be tested by

In Section 9 .2.3. Active surveillance ,the following change swere made:
There will be contact [CONTACT_489796]/study  staff and subject’s parent(s)/LAR(s) 
on a regular basis (weekly  during the RSV season and every  month outside the RSV 
season). If there has not been a contact [CONTACT_10782] a clinic visit (i.e., Visits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6*, 
7, 8, 9), a passive surveillance contact (refer to Section 9.2.1), an assessment visit (refer

for solicited symptoms in infa ntshas been changed as follows
:
*Fever is defined as temperature 38.0°C / 100.4° F by [CONTACT_28414]. The preferred location for measuring temperature 
in this study will be the axilla for subjects 1 and < 5 years of age and the rectum for subjects < 12 months of age.
The Section [IP_ADDRESS].2. Assessment of causality, the following change wasmade:
The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between stud y vaccines and the 
occurrence of each AE/SAE using clinical judgement. In case of concomitant 
administration of multiple vaccines/products, if possible, the investigator should specify  
if the AE could be causally  related to a specific vaccine/product administered (i.e., 
investigational, control or co -administered vaccine). When causal relationship to a 
specific vaccine(s)/product(s) cannot be determined the investigator should indicate the 
AE to be related to all products.

01-AUG -2019 207In Section 11.4. Determination of sample size ,the following change shavebeen made:
The sample size determination is based on the minimum number of subjects needed to 
allow detection of a serious ERD signal of ERD of the having a magnitude similar to 
that occurred in association with of the historic FI -RSV vaccine trials [ Kim, 1969]. A 
total of 150 infants will be enrolled and randomized with 1:1:1 ratio intoto receiv e
either receiving 1dose of the 1.5x1010vp/dose ChAd-155 RSV  vaccine [the 1D RSV  + 
comparator group], 2 doses of the 5x1010vp/dose ChAd -155 RSV vaccine [the 2DRSV  
+ comparator group ], or no ChAd- 155 RSV vaccine [the comparator/Placebo control.
alone group].
An effect of vaccination on ERD will be monitored very closely. It is anticipated that 
prior to the transmission season approximately  70% of infants [ADDRESS_629600] 50% of 
subjects [ Dunn , 2013] w ill be RSV naïve i.e., have not experienced an RSV RTI  
previously  [, 2014]. I f the magnitude of ERD risk in RS V naïve children is as extreme as 
that observed in the FI trial (80% of RSV RTI progress to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]), and in 
contrast a negative RSV experienced children follow a usual clinical course of infection 
(5% of RSV RTI require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) then in this cohort including RSV experienced 
and naive infants an overall rate of 60% RSV RTI requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_489701] [ ,
1969]. RSV hospi[INVESTIGATOR_489702] (at screening
which will be assessed. by[INVESTIGATOR_2993]-stream serological testing of baseline samples) . While the 
rate of RSV infection could be highly variable by [CONTACT_165221], a conservative rate of 
infection of 20% in the first season is assumed [Kutsayataken. Therefore, a total of 10 
infected infants would be expected from 50 RSV vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. , 2016]. Therefore, 
with [ADDRESS_629601] 5 
infected infants with a negative RSV  exposure status (at screening based on in -stream 
baseline serological testing ) in each RSV vaccine group [ 50×0.5×0.2=5].
With a one -sided type I error of 0.05, and the assumption of thea 10% rate of 10% 
infection progressing to very severe RS V-LRTI, (which is a conservative assumption 
based on the rate in the natural history of disease), [ADDRESS_629602] 
90% statistical power to demonstrate the progression rate from infection to very severe 
RSV-LRTI is less than 80% . That is less e xtreme than that observed in the historic FI-
RSV vaccine trial where 80% of RSV RTI cases progressed to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] [Kim, 
1969]. During the 60%. course of the study, since the actual negative RSV exposure 
status (at screening based on in -stream baseline serological testing ) and infection rates 
may be lower than 50% and 20%, respectively, the sample size will be adjusted as 
need edthrough additional recruitment in order to achieve at least 5 RSV  infected 
infants with a negative RSV exposure status (at screening based on in -stream 
baseline 
serological testing )in each RSV vaccine group .
If a maximum of 21 out of 105 infections in infants receiving ChAd- 155 RSV vaccine 
progress to very  severe RSV -LRTI, then it can be concluded with 95% confidence that 
theexpected progression rate of infection is less than the effect reported in previous FI -
RSV trials; if a minimum of 43 out of 105 infections progress to very  severe RSV -LRTI 
then it can be concluded with 95% confidence that the expected progression rate of

SAE would be about 92% if the true incidence rate of SAE is 5%. For estimating the 
proportion of subjects with AEs, the maximum width of exact 95% confidence interval 
(CI) would be under 30%, and it could be as large as 35% if attrition rate is 30%. Figure 
6 illustrates the precision on the estimate for the proportion of subjects with AEs 
following vaccination with each RSV formulation based on the number of subjects with 
AEs observed from 50 subjects.
In addition, relative risks for enhanced RSV- LRTI of RSV vaccine versus control will be 
monitored and evaluated. Under the assumption of 5% of annual LRTI event rate in 
control group, a one year follow up, and one- sided ty pe I error of 0.1, the current sample 
size is able to provide about 80% statistical power to rule out the relative risk of at least 
8.5 (vaccine vs. control) in absence of vaccine efficacy . The power anal ysis is based on

For a given subject and the anal ysis of solicited AEs during the 7 -day follow -up period 
after vaccination, missing or non -evaluable measurements will not be replaced. Therefore 
the anal ysis of the solicited symptoms based on the TVC ESwill include only  vaccinated 
subjects with documented safet y data (i.e., s ymptom screen completed)
The Section 11.6.3. Immunogenicity was amended as follows:
Determination of a negative RSV exposure status in infants at 6 to 7 m onths of age will 
be based on RSV A and/or B neutralizing antibody titers present in serum at screening 
(before vaccination with the RSV vaccine) based on in- stream baseline serological 
testing. At birth, newborns do show positive for neutralizing antibodi es due to maternal 
transfer during gestation. The titer of these antibodies declines over time. At the age of

allow the discrimination between a negative RSV exposure status versus RSV infected 
infants before start of vaccination.

The Section 11.9. Analysis of immunogenicity was amended as follows:
The primary  anal ysiswill be performed on the PP cohort PPS for immunogenicity  and, if 
in any  group the percentage of vaccinated subjects with serological results excluded from 
the PP cohort PPS for immunogenicit y is more than 10%, a second anal ysis will be 
performed on the TVC ES. The results from immunogenicity  anal ysis will be reported by  
[CONTACT_489797].
For the final analysis, the Adapted PPS for immunogenicity analysis will be used 
which allows the summary of immunogenicity resul ts by [CONTACT_7206]. In summary table 
on the Adapted PPS for immunogenicity, PPS for immunogenicity at Day 61 will be 
used for Pre, Day 31 and Day 61 immunogenicity summary and PPS for 
immunogenicity at Day 365 for Day 365 immunogenicity summary.
The infants are monitored for RSV infection starting from dose 1 and therefore 
immunogenicity analyses can be adjusted to exclude those infants with an infection 
prior to sampling.
In the Section 11.9.1. Within groups assessment, the Section [IP_ADDRESS]. Analysis of 
secondary objectives had the following changes:
For boththree pooled groups, at each timepoint that blood samples are collected for 
humoral immune response against the investigational RSV vaccine (neutralizing antibody  
titers against RSV -A, RSV F antibod y concentrations and palivizumab -competing 
antibody  concentrations): ).
An immunogenicity analysis will also be performed on the ES with a negative RSV 
exposure status (at screening based on in-stream baseline serological testing ) for whom 
immunogenicity data are available.
The Section [IP_ADDRESS]. Analysis of tertiary objective was amended as follows:
If available, an y further exploratory immunology results (including, but not limited to 
anti-vector immunity  and palivizumab -competin g antibody concentrations) will be 
reported b y timepoint forthe two pooled RSV vaccine group sand the pooled comparator 
group and timepoint 
using descriptive summary  statistics.
The Section 11.10. Analysis of RTI and LRTI was amended as follows:
The primary analy sis will be performed on the TVC ESof subjects with a negative RSV 
exposure status (at screening based on in- stream baseline serological testing) in the 
pooled single dose RSV vaccine group , the pooled two dose RSV vaccine group, and the 
pooled comparator group separately  for first and second RSV seasons and overall. A 
similar analysis will be performed on the entire ES. As primary  anal ysis, the assessment 
of RSV infection will be performed using the quantitative RT -PCR according to 
standardiz edcase definitions (see Table 6 ) based on the available WHO case definitions.

the event will be tabulated. The rate (with 95% CI) of RSV -RTI and RSV -LRTI and 
infections progressing to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_489703]. RSV infection (sy mptomatic or asymptomatic) will be assessed by  [CONTACT_489798] -PCR (RSV -A/B) or locally available test.
The rate of very severe RSV -LRTI among RSV infected infants with a negative RSV 
exposure status (at screening based on in- stream baseline serological testing) from first 
vaccination (Day 1) up to the end of the first RSV transmission season will be 
estimated as well as 95% one -sided lower CI.
The proportion and the relative risk of subjects with at least one RSV -associated RTI 
(with 95% CI) will be calculated. between each of two pooled RSV vaccine groups and 
the pooled control group will be calculated for both the cohort of subjects with a
negative RSV exposure status (at screening based on in -stream baseline serological 
testing ) on the ES and on the entire ES. The same descriptive anal ysis will be performed 
for subjects with at least one RSV -associated LRTI and those with at least one RSV -
associated severe LRTI.
Descriptive anal yses (mean, median, min, max) of viral load assessed b y the quantitative 
RT-PCR (RSV -A/B) of RSV -RTI, RSV -associated L RTI and severe LRTI all cases as 
listed in Table 6will be tabulated. by [CONTACT_489799] . This anal ysis will also be done on 
the twothree pooled groups.

performed for all cause L RTI and all cause severe LRTI. These will also be presented for 
each viral etiology  identified by  [CONTACT_489776].
The incidence rate of as ymptomatic RSV infections (with 95% CI) detected by  [CONTACT_489777] (RSV -A/B), will be tabulated by  [CONTACT_489800].

The RVP (Multiplex PCR) on specimens from all RSV -A/B positive and confirmed 
LRTI cases, according to case definition presented in Table 6 ( Figure 3), will be 
tabulated as a qualitative assessment profiling the potential co -infections occurring in 
these subjects.
The Section 11.11. Interpretation of a nalyses was amended as follows:
For the occurrence of very severe RSV -LRTI among RSV infected infants with a 
negative RSV exposure status (at screening based on in -stream baseline serological 
testing) from first vaccination (Day 1) up to the end of the fir st RSV transmission 
season, if the upper boundary of the 95% one -sided lower CI of the rate is under 80%, 
it indicates that the very severe RSV- LRTI rate is less than that of the historic RSV -FI 
trials [ Kim, 1969].

Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_629611], v Virus neutralization is performed by  [CONTACT_117838] a fixed amount of RSV -A long 
strain ( Long, ATCC No. VR -26) with serial dilutions of the test serum. Then, the serum -
virus mixture is transferred onto a monolay er of Vero cells (African Green Monkey , 
kidney , Cercopi[INVESTIGATOR_227203] , ATCC CCL -81) and incubated for three day s to allow 
infection of Vero cells b y non -neutralized viruses and the formation of plaques in the cell 
monolay er. Following the fixation period, RSV -infected cells are detected using a 
primary  antibody  directed against RSV (anti -RSV IgG) and a secondary  antibody  
conjugated with fluore scein isothiocy anate, horse -radish peroxidase (HRP) , allowing the 
visualization of plaques by [CONTACT_31122]. after coloration with TrueBlue 
peroxidase substrate .Viral plaques are counted using an automated microscope coupled 
to an image anal yzer (Scanl ab sy stem with Axiovision software). For each serum 
dilution, a ratio, expressed as a percentage, is calculated between the number of plaques 
at that dilution and the number of plaques in the virus control wells (no serum added). 
The serum neutralizing ant ibody  titer is expressed in ED60 (Estimated Dilution 60) and 
corresponds to the inverse of the interpolated serum dilution that y ields a 60% reduction 
in the number of plaques compared to the virus control wells as described by [CONTACT_2312] 
[Barbas, 1992; Bates, 2014].
ELISA
Anti- RSV protein F ELISA
The anti -F protein IgG ELISA is an indirect ELISA allowing the detection and the 
quantitation of specific IgG antibodies directed against the RSV F protein in human 
serum samples. PreF antigen will be adsorbed onto a 96- well polystyrene 
microplate. After a washing and a blocking step, dilutions of serum samples, 
controls and standards will be added to the coated microplate. A reference 
standard curve will be prepared using a pool of commercial human serum 
containing an ti-RSV antibodies. After incubation, the microplate will be washed to 
remove unbound primary antibodies. Bound IgG will be detected by [CONTACT_1121] 
a secondary anti-human antibody conjugated to HRP. Bound antibodies are 
quantified by [CONTACT_227269], tetramethylbenzidine and 
hydrogen peroxide, whereby a colored product develops proportionally to the 
amount of anti -preF IgG antibodies present in the serum sample. The optical 
density of each sample dilution is then interpolated on the ref erence standard. The 
corresponding antibody concentration, corrected for the dilution factor, is 
expressed in arbitrary ELISA Laboratory Units per milliliter (ELU/mL).
PCR Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT -PCR)
Quantitative RT-PCR able to discriminate RSV -A and RSV -B subt ypes:
Briefl y, RSV A and RSV B RNAs extracted from the nasal swabs are detected in a 
duplex PCR format using specific amplification primers and fluorescent probes 
designed in the RSV N gene, encoding the RSV nucleocapsid p rotein. The process 
involves nucleic acids extraction, conversion of RNA to complementary  
deoxyribonucleic acid b y reverse transcription and detection b y real -time PCR 
reaction using a calibration curve (absolute quantitation). The RSV viral load is 
repor ted as copi[INVESTIGATOR_333946].

01-AUG -2019 225Section [IP_ADDRESS], Study Population was amended as follows: 
The immunogenicit y, safety  and reactogenicit y of the pediatric candidate RSV vaccine 
(ChAd155- RSV vaccine) has been evaluated in healthy  adults aged 18 to 45 y ears (study  
201974 [RSV PED -001; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]]). A clinical study  is currentl y being conducted 
in RSV -seropositive infants aged 12 to 23 months (study  204838 [RSV PED -002]). The 
safet y profile of the ChAd155 -RSV vaccine in adults (study  201974 [RSV PED -001; 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]]) has been 
evaluated deemed satisfactory  by [CONTACT_489802] (IDMC). Should there be a satisfactory  safet y profile of the 
ChAd155- RSV vaccine in RSV -seropositive infants, as evaluated b y an IDMC on Day  60 
data (i.e., [ADDRESS_629620] dose level) of the study  RSV PED -002, the 
present stud y will be performed. This study will be conducted on infants aged 6 and 7 
months (having a low chance of natural exposure to RSV before inclusion in the study ). 
Although pot entially both RSV -exposed and RSV -unexposed subjects will be enrolled, 
Tthe primary  analy sis for incidence of L RTI will be conducted in infants with a negative 
RSV exposure status (at screening based on in -stream serological testing). This study  will 
support the decision to age de-escalate to the targeted population (infants as from 6 weeks 
of age) (Amended 21 March 2019) . 
Section 1.2.4, Rationale for safety monitoring plan was amended as follows: 
During this stud y, safety evaluations will be performed by [CONTACT_489803] (iSRC) (refer to Section 9.10.2) and an independent data monitoring 
committee (IDMC )(refer to Section 9.10.3), with specific holding rules. Data of LRTI 
associated with RSV infection will be received b y the IDMC within 48 hours upon [COMPANY_004] 
becoming aware (refer to Section 9.10.3 for more detailed information). Any holding 
rules met during the study will be escalated to the Vaccine Safet y Monitoring Board 
(VSMB; refer to Sections 
9.10.4 and9.10.5) (Amended 21 March 2019) .
Section [IP_ADDRESS], Rationale for monitoring for spontaneous or excessive bleeding was
revised as follows: 
During a study  carried out in adult subjects (RSV001), a mild non
-clinically significant 
drop in hemoglobin was noted following vaccination with anothe r adenoviral vector 
(PanAd3 -RSV) without clinical signs and with a reversal towards baseline values over 
time [ RSV001 I nterim Study  Report, 2014]. In the repeat dose toxicology  study  in rabbits 
using the ChAd155 -RSV vaccine, a transient non -clinically  significant drop in platelets 
was noted post IM vaccination (maximal drop of platelet observed 24 hours after 
vaccination; refer to the current IB for further details). I
n light of these data, subjects’ 
parent(s)/ legally  acceptable representative(s) (LAR[s]) will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_1275]/stud y staff if their child presents s ymptoms of spontaneous bleeding or eas y 
bruising or if their child develops a rash, within 30 days after either vaccination (Visit 1 
and Visit 3) , in order to detect any th rombocy topenic petechiae or purpura. The 
investigator will, based on his/her medical judgment, measure the total blood count and

01-AUG -2019 226Section 1.2.7, Rationale for ChAd155 RSV vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_489708]: 
To provide potential benefit to all trial participants and to maintain the study  blind until 
the end of follow up, the ChAd155- RSV vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_489601] (Amended 21 March 2019).
Section 1.3.1, Risk Asses sment was amended as follows: 
As with all injectable vaccines, immediate s ystemic allergic reactions to vaccination can 
occur. In order to be able to treat infants with an immediate sy stemic allergic reaction to 
vaccination, all infants across all steps groups will need to remain under observation 
(visual follow- up as well as measurement of vital signs) at the stud y site for at least 
60minutes after vaccination for Visit 1 and Visit 3 and 30 minutes for all remaining 
vaccination visits (Amended 21 March 2019) .
Section 1.3.2, Benefit Assessment was amended as follows: 
The choice of active comparator vaccine ( Bexsero, Nimenrix, Synflorix, orMenveo ) for 
each participating country ensures that the vaccine may  be given according to the local 
label and provides potential medical benefit in the country that chose active comparator. 
Within a given participating country , all infants in both groups of this study will receive 
the full locally  recommended vaccination course of active comparator v accine where 
possible and may  be immunized against either invasive meningococcal disease caused b y 
Neisseria meningitidi s(with the meningococcal vaccines Bexsero, Nimenrix or Menveo );
or against invasive pneumococcal disease , pneumonia, and acute otitis media caused b y 
Streptococcus pneumoniae (with the pneumococcal vaccine Synflorix) (Amended 21
March 2019) .
Section 1.3.2, Overall Benefit: Risk Conclusion was amende d as follows: 
The investigational ChAd155- RSV vaccine is currently  in Phase I/II stage of clinical 
development and no vaccine efficacy  has been demonstrated. Taking into account the 
measures taken to minimize the risk to 
infants participating in this study , the potential 
risks to the subjects are justified by  [CONTACT_489738].
The four control vaccines administered to all participants in this study  as active 
comparator s, are licensed for infants in the particular country where possible, and 
therefore have demonstrated medical benefit in the prevention of invasive meningococcal 
disease caused b y Neisseria meningitidis (for the meningococcal vaccines Bexsero,
Nimenrix, Me nveo ); or against invasive pneumococcal disease , pneumonia, and acute 
otitis media caused b yStreptococcus pneumoniae (for the pneumococcal vaccine 
Synflorix )(Amended 21 March 2019) .

written. 
The statistical anal yses will be performed in 3steps:
An anal ysis will be performed when all data up to Day 61 (i.e., data that are as clean 
as possible) are available. Additional safet y data available at the time of this analysis 
will be described. At this point, the statistician will be unblinded (i.e., individual 
subject treatment assignments will be available) and the study  will be conducted i n a 
single blind manner, with patients remaining blinded up to the last study  visit ( end of 
the second RSV transmission season). Summary  results may  unblind some specific 
subjects but no individual listings will be provided and the investigator will not ha ve 
access to the treatment allocation up to the last study  visit ( end of the second RSV

Section 6.7.3 was updated for clarification as follows: 
Section 6.7.3     Laboratory assays
Please refer to APPENDIX A for a detail ed description of the assay s performed in the 
study . Please refer to APPENDIX B for the address of the clinical laboratories for sample 
analysis.
Determination of a negative RSV exposure status in infants at 6 to 7 months of age will 
be based on RSV A and/ or B neutralizing antibody
 titers present in serum at screening 
(before vaccination with the RSV vaccine) based on in- stream baseline serological 
testing. At birth, newborns do show positive for neutralizing antibodies due to maternal 
transfer during gesta tion. The titer of these antibodies declines over time. At the age of [ADDRESS_629662] experienced a recent RSV infection. This cut -off will thus 
allow the discrimination between a negative RSV exposure status versus RSV infected 
infants before start of vaccination. 
The following laboratory assay s are planned:
Functional (ne utralizing) antibody  titers against RSV -A will be measured by  a 
neutralization assay  on serum samples ( Table 10 ).
RTI will be assessed by :
Quantitative RT-PCR that is able to discriminate RSV -A and RSV -B subty pes 
(Table 11).
Qualitative multiplex PCR for detection of a panel of viruses ( Table 11 ).
Local RSV assay , and /orlocal RVP where available ( Table 11) (Amended [ADDRESS_629663] 2019) .

FI-RSV vaccine trials [ Kim, 1969]. A total of 150 infants will be enrolled and 
randomized with 1:1:1 ratio to receive either 1 dose of the 1. 5x1010vp/dose ChAd-
155 
RSV vaccine [the 1D RSV + comparator group ], 2 doses of the 5x1010vp/dose ChAd-
155 RSV vaccine [the 2D RSV + comparator group], or no ChAd -155 RSV vaccine [the 
comparator/Placebo control alone group ].
An effect of vaccination on ERD will be monitored very  closel y.It is anticipated that at 
least 50% of subjects [ Dunn , 2013] will have a negative RSV exposure status (at 
screening which will be assessed by  [INVESTIGATOR_2993]-stream serological testing of baseline samples). 
While the rate of RSV infection could be highl y variable b y season, a conservative rate of 
infection of 20% in the first season is assumed [ Kutsay a, 2016]. Therefore, with [ADDRESS_629670] 5 infected infants 
with a negative RSV exposure status (at screening based on in-stream baseline 
serological testing) in each RSV vaccine group [ 50×0.5×0.2=5 ].
With a one -sided ty pe I error of 0.05, and the assumption of a 10% rate of infection 
progressing to very  severe RSV -LRTI (which is a conservative assumption based on the 
rate in the natural history of disease), [ADDRESS_629671] 90% statistical 
power to demonstrate the progression rate from infection to very  severe RSV -LRTIis 
less than 80%. That is less extreme than that observed in the historic FI -RSV vaccine trial 
where 80% of RSV RTI cases progressed to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] [ Kim, 1969]. During the 
course of the stud y,since the actual negative RSV exposure status (at screening based on 
in-stream baseline serological testing) and infection rates may  be lower than 50% and 
20%, respectively , the sample size willmay be adjusted as needed through additional 
recruitment in order to achieve at least 5 a sufficient number of RSV infected infants
with a negative RSV exposure status (at screening based on in- stream baseline 
serological testing) in each RSV vaccine group (Am ended [ADDRESS_629672] 2019) .

range fo r the unscheduled visits will be provided as per the toxicity  scale refered in the 
protocol .The maximum grading during the study  will be tabulated (Refer to APPENDIX 
C) Laboratory values will be classified according to toxicity  criteria. Laboratory  values
that are outside the normal range will also be flagged in the data listings, along with 
corresponding normal ranges and assessment of clinical significance (Am ended [ADDRESS_629681] 2019) .
Section 11.10 was updated as follows: 
11.10. Analy sis of RTI and L RTI 
The primary  anal ysis will be performed on the ES of subjects with a negative RSV 
exposure status (at screening based on in- stream baseline serological testing) in the 
pooled single dose RSV vaccine group, the pooled two dose RSV vaccine group, and the 
pooled comparator group separately  for first and second RSV seasons and overall. A

of RSV infection will be performed using the quantitative RT -PCR according to 
standardiz edcase definitions (see Table 6 ) based on the available WHO case definitions. 
The number of RSV infections within each group and the maximum disease severit y of 
the event will be tabulated. The rate (with 95% CI) of RSV -RTI and RSV -LRTI and 
infections pr ogressing to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_489648]. 
The incidence rate of very severe RSV -LRTI among RSV infected infants with a 
negative RSV exposure status (at screening based on in- stream baseline serological 
testing) from first vaccination (Day  1) up to the end of the first RSV transmission season 
will be estimated as well as 95% one- sided lower CI .
The proportion incidence rate and the relative risk of subjects with at least one RSV -
associated RTI (with 95% CI) between each of two pooled RSV vaccine groups and the 
pooled control group will be calculated for both the cohort of subjects with a negative 
RSV exposure status (at screening based on in- stream baseline serological testing ) on the 
ES and on the entire ES. The same descriptive analy sis will be performed for subjects 
with at least one RSV -associated L RTI and those with at least one RSV -associated severe 
LRTI (Am ended [ADDRESS_629682] 2019) . 
Section 11.12.1 was updated as follows:
11.12.1 Sequence of analyses
In pre paration of the planned iSRC and I DMC evaluations, analy ses of all available 
safet y data (i.e., data that are as clean as possible) will be performed (see Section 9.10 for 
more information). These anal yses will be done by  [CONTACT_489808] y, and will be 
documented in a statistical anal ysis report. Onl y the outcome of the iSRC and IDMC 
reviews will be communicated to the RSV study  team (no safet y signal or safet y signal ). 
No clinical study report will be written (Amended [ADDRESS_629683] 2019) .

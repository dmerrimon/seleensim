Number of Patients:  Approximately 100 patients will be randomized. Patients who 
discontinue study participation prior to completing the study 
will not be replaced.  
  
Study Design : This is a randomized, 2 DB treatment period  dosing study, to 
be conducted at multiple centers in the [LOCATION_002] . 
Previously diagnosed patients with a history of epi[INVESTIGATOR_41989] (as defined by [CONTACT_142894], 3rd edition [beta version]1 [ICHD-3] ), 
who experience an average of [ADDRESS_1099918] 12 months, with no more than 
14 headache days per month, and with 48 hours of 
headache- free time between migraine headaches , will be 
randomized in a 1:1 ratio in both DB periods  to receive either

take their normal migraine medication during this screening 
period.  
Randomized patients  will be instructed to use the study 
medication in 1 migraine attack as soon as (and no more than 
within 1 hour after) experiencing moderate to severe pain 
(defined as headache pain rating  of Grade 2 [moderate] or 
Grade  3 [severe] on pain severity scale of 0 to 3 ). Patients will 
return to the study site within 2 to 7 days in the DB1 treatment 
period and, if continuing to be eligible, will be re -randomized 
into a DB2 treatment period t o receive either DFN -02 
(sumatriptan nasal spray ) 10 mg or a matching placebo to 
treat 1 migraine attack at any pain level. They will then return 
to the study site within 2 to 7  days of their second treatment 
for study completion as sessments. Once randomized, the 
total duration of each patient’s participation in the study would be up to [ADDRESS_1099921] dose and after completing in 
the electronic diary ( eDiary ) the [ADDRESS_1099922] on function and the patient’s satisfaction with the study 
medication will be collected.  Patients will record criteria in 
real-time in an eDiary that will include, but is not limited to, the 
date and time of each migraine attack, the occurr ence of 
aura, predose pain level, date and time of study medication 
use, postdose pain level, symptoms and functional disability, 
treatment satisfaction , and date and time of rescue 
medication. The eDiary will be reviewed for compliance and 
rescue medicati on. Data will be entered into the electronic 
case report form (eCRF). After study  completion or early 
termination, patients should be referred to their usual 
healthcare professional to resume pre- study standard of care, 
as per the Investigator discretion.  
  
Treatment:  For the DB1 treatment period, all patients will be randomly 
assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either  DFN- 02 10 mg or a 
matching placebo t o be used in 1 migraine attack as soon as 
(and no more than within 1 hour after) experiencing moderate 
to severe pain. Eligible p atient s will then be re- randomized in

medication may be repeated once (if needed) , more than 2 
hours  after the initial dose and after completing in the eDiary 
the 2 hour s postdose assessments . 
  
Study Duration:  The duration of study participation will be up to approximately 
13 weeks, including a screening period of approximately 
3 weeks ( wherein patients may be randomized earlier than 3 
weeks provided they meet inclusion/exclusion criteria and 
headache assessment criteria; the screening period may also 
be extended based on Investigator judgment and in 
consultation with the Medical Monitor), 2  DB treatment 
periods with up to 4 weeks (each period) for patients to 
experience and treat migraine attack s, and 2 to 7 days for 
patients to retu rn to the site after treatment. The 2 DB 
treatment periods combined would total up to 10  weeks.  
  
Study Population:  Male and female patients [ADDRESS_1099925]

 4 Introduction  
Migraine headache is a disabling neurological disorder with clinical findings of headache, 
often associated with nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia. In the [LOCATION_002] ( US), 
about 17 % of all women and 6% of all men suffer from m igraine.[ADDRESS_1099946] mechanism of migraine headache is not known, the pathophysiology is 
related to alteration in the neurochemical balance of the brain to trigemin al-vascular 
activation and release of vasoactive peptides . Radiological investigations in migraine 
patients are characterized by [CONTACT_797636][INVESTIGATOR_797618] , the brainstem, and the trigeminal nerve ganglion.3,4 
Clinically, migraine with aura occurs in 5 phases: prodrome, aura, headache, resolution, and postheadache.  The prodr 
ome phase is associated with nonspecific symptoms such as 
fatigue,  muscle pain in the neck and head, cognitive impairment, anxiety, and irritability. 
Auras are focal  neurological changes typi[INVESTIGATOR_223282] a visual or somatosensory nature, lasting 
less than 60 minutes.  Auras are considered to occur as the result of electrical disturbances 
in the brain. Auras occur in approximately 15% of migraine attacks. The headache phase 
can be divided into mild, moderate,  and severe phases. The mild phase is the peri od of time 
from headache awareness to the onset of  moderate pain.  
 
In general, the headache phase lasts  4 to 72 hours. The postheadache phase 
lasts up to 48 hours and is characterized with symptoms  similar to those of the prodrome.5,6 
Typi[INVESTIGATOR_452873], pulsating quality, 
moderate or sev
ere pain, aggravation by [CONTACT_238960], and association with 
nausea and/or photophobia and phonophobia. It is important to initiate pharmacotherapy as 
early as possible to abort the migraine before it becomes severe and more resistant to 
treatment .7 
Several therapi[INVESTIGATOR_797619], ergot alkaloids, nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory  drugs 
(NSAIDs), aspi[INVESTIGATOR_797620], and/or opi[INVESTIGATOR_797621]. Migraine- specific therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], such as triptans or ergot alkaloids, 
have become the treatment of choice when patients respond poorly to NSAIDs or 
combination regimens of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_439736]. For most migraine sufferers, triptans are the 
drug class of choice both from efficacy and tolerability perspecti ves.
8  
Sumatriptan, a 5 -hydroxy- tryptam ine (5- HT) 1B/1D receptor agonist  developed by 
[CONTACT_35316],  is marketed under the brand name [CONTACT_797673]®. Sumatriptan is one of the 
most commonly used triptans for the treatment of acute migraine headache. Oral, intranasal, 
and subcutaneous injectable formulations of sumatriptan are approved by [CONTACT_3361] (FDA) and are available on the market . The relative bioavailability for 
Imitrex  following subcutaneous administration is significantly higher compared to intranasal 
or oral administration .9-11 The therapeutic response rate at 2 hours is dependent upon the 
mode of administration— subcutaneous 70%, oral 59%, and intranasal 61% .12  
The onset of action with subcutaneous sumatriptan (10 minutes) is faster than with 
intranasal (30 to 
45 minutes) or oral (45 to 60 minutes) delivery .9,10,13,[ADDRESS_1099947]. Reddy’s Laboratories, Ltd.

discussed in a number of journal publications15-21 (  drug master file , reference data  on

One 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_9205] 1 study (DFP- 02-CD-009)26 and four pi[INVESTIGATOR_42751] 1 studies 
(DFP -02-CD-008,22 2419/11,23 1931/09 ,24 and 2010/1025) have been conducted in a total of 
154 healthy adult male and female volunteers at a dose range of 5 mg to 20 mg. DFN -02 
was generally well -tolerated without any clinically meaningful changes in laboratory 
parameters or vital signs.  
Overall, the pharmacokinetic ( PK) data suggest t hat sumatriptan achieved peak plasma 
concent ration rapi[INVESTIGATOR_797622] 10 minutes following 10 mg DFP -02 intranasal spray, 
approximately 5 minutes sooner than that of the 4 mg and 6 mg Imitrex injections . This 
profile may lead to improved onset of therapeutic benefit for patients  suffering from  migraine 
headaches.  
In addition, in one Phase 3 open -label clinical sa fety study (DFP -02-CD-010),27 167 patients 
used DFN- 02 (studied as DFP- 02) to treat migraine attacks for up to 6 months. Overall, 
4 patients experienced 5 serious adverse events ( SAEs ). Three of the SAEs  were 
treatment -emergent (one subject each; diverticulitis, pyelonephritis and menometrorrhagia) , 
and all 5 SAEs were considered by [CONTACT_797637].  No 
new safety results were noted; the study results are currently being summarized and will be 
reported in the next version of the Investigator’s Brochure.

6 Investigational Plan 
6.1 Overall Study Design and Plan  
This is a randomized, 2 DB treatment period dosing study, to be conducted at multiple 
centers in the US. Previously diagnosed patients with a history of epi[INVESTIGATOR_17730] ( as 
defined by [CONTACT_25419], 3rd edition [beta version]1 
[ICHD-3] ), who experience an average of [ADDRESS_1099955] 12 months, with no more than 14 headache days per month, and with 48 hours of 
headache- free tim e between migraine, will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio in both DB periods  to 
receive either  DFN- 02 (sumatriptan nasal spray ) [ADDRESS_1099956] a 
12-month medical history of acute migraine will be eligible for enrollment in the treatment 
period. Patients will continue to take their normal migraine medication during thi s screening 
period.  
During the screening period, the electronic diary ( eDiary ) will be dispensed in order for the 
patient to enter information for daily check -in, record at least 1 migraine attack , and rescue 
medication use, to determine the patient’s ability to properly use the eDiary . If eligible and 
randomized, patients in the DB1 treatment period will be instructed to use the study 
medication in 1 migraine attack as soon as (and no more than within 1 hour after) 
experiencing  moderate to severe migraine pain (defined as headache pain rating of Grade  2 
[moderate] or Grade 3 [severe] on a pain severity scale of 0 to 3 ). If the patient  is not able to 
use study medication for the first migraine after randomization, they should be instructed to 
use the study medication for the next attack. Those patients who do not experience a 
migraine attack , and/or who do not treat any migraine attack with study medication or record 
eDiary data, will not be allowed to continue into the DB2 treatm ent period, and will be 
discontinued. After treating a migraine attack with study medication, patients should be 
instructed to contact [CONTACT_11255] 24 hours of the treated migraine (or the next working day) 
to schedule their next visit.  
Patients will re turn to the s tudy site within 2 to 7 days in the DB1 treatment period and, if 
continuing  to be eligible, will be re -randomized into a DB2 treatment  period to treat 
1 migraine attack at any pain level. They will then return to the study site within 2 to 7 days 
of the second treatment. Once randomized, the total duration of each patient’s participation in the study would be up to [ADDRESS_1099957] dose of study medication a patient does not 
 experience sufficient relief , 
he/she may take a second dose of study medication for the same attack, or take  rescue 
medication more than [ADDRESS_1099958]. Reddy’s Laboratories, Ltd. 
Protocol No. DFN-02-CD-[ADDRESS_1099959]. Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd.  [ADDRESS_1099960] dose of study medication after 2 hours, he/she should not take a 
second dose, but may take rescue medication instead, if needed. Rescue medication will be 
decided between the Investigator  and the patient. No more than [ADDRESS_1099961] on migraine pain, symptoms, function, rescue medication, 
and the patient’s satisfaction will be collected by [CONTACT_797639] -time in an eDiary . See 
Section [IP_ADDRESS].1  for eDiary assessment criteria. The eDiary will be reviewed for 
compliance and rescue medication, and data will be entered into the  electronic case report 
form (eCRF). After  study completion or discontinuation, patients should be referred to their 
usual healthcare professional to resume pre- study standard of care, as per the Investigator

 7.3.1  Additional Exclusion Criteria  
Patients presenting with a history of hypertension that is uncontrolled during screening (i.e., 
SBP >  140 mmHg and/or 
DBP >  90 mmHg ), whether on treatment or not, will be excluded. 
Patients  who had high or uncontrolled BPs in the past  and are  currently controlled with given 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_452881].  
Independent of past history, if a patient  has a sustained resting SBP >  140 mmHg and/or 
DBP > 90 mmHg at Visit 1 (V1) or Visit 2 (V2), those patients should be excluded. Any 
patient without  a known history of hypertension that presents at screening with SBP > 140 
mmHg and/or DBP >  90 mmHg should be excluded if the BP reading is due to suspected 
hypertension or another pathological conditi on, not if due to a transient fluctuation, based on

 7.4 Removal of Patients  from Therapy or Assessments  
Patient s are free to withdraw from the study at any time without providing any reason(s) f or 
withdrawal and without prejudice to further treatment. If a patient is to be withdrawn from the 
study by [CONTACT_737], the Investigator should first alert the Medical  Monitor, if safety 
allows, or as soon as possible thereafter.  
Patient s may be withdrawn from the study  for any of the  following reasons, and the date and 
reason(s) for withdrawal will be documented in the eCRF: 
1. A patient develops any significant illness, or needs to undergo any acute major 
surgery, du
ring the course of the study.  
2. A patient was enrolled and observed to violate any protocol requirement that 
may affect 
the outcome of the study.  
3. A patient withdraws consent.  
4. The Inves
tigator deems it may not be safe or proper for the patient  to continue i n 
the study.  
 A patient who becomes pregnant at any time during the study must be discontinued.  
Patient s prematur 
ely withdrawing from the study after entering the treatment period will be 
encouraged to complete the early termination (V4/ET) evaluations according to this  protocol.  
In the event that a patient  disconti nues prematurely from the study due to a treatment -
emergent adverse event  (TEAE) or serious TEAE, the TEAE or serious T EAE will be 
followed until it resolves (returns to normal or baseline values) or stabilizes, or until it is 
judged by [CONTACT_39982].  
Once a patient  is withdrawn, they may not re -enter the study.  
Reasonable efforts will be made to contact [CONTACT_4676] s who are lost to follow -up. At a minimum, 
[ADDRESS_1099973] be documented in the patient ’s file.  
The Sponsor has the right to terminate the study at any time in the event  of SAEs , or if 
spec
ial circumstances occur relating to the study medication that the Sponsor deems 
unfeasible to continue the study. In this event, the Investigators  will be informed of th e 
reason for study termination.

9 Administration of Study Treatments  
9.1 Method of  Assigning Patient s to Treatment Groups 
The DF N-02-CD-012 study  is a randomized, 2 DB treatment periods , placebo- controlled 
study. Treatment sequences will be assigned randomly in each DB period with a 1:1 ratio to 
receive either DFN -02 or matching placebo ( Figure 6-1). 
9.1.1  Screening (Vis
it 1) 
After written informed consent is obtained and the patient has been confirmed as qualifying 
to 
enter the screening period, the Investigator  or designee will contact [CONTACT_797645] (IWRS)  to obtain a unique patient  identification (ID) number  
to be used throughout the study . This patient ID number will not be reused for any other 
participant in the study . This unique  identifier  comprises the numerical order of the patients 
screened and will be used to identify the patient  on the eCRF. 
9.1.2  Randomization  (Visit 2)  
Once a pa
tient’s eligibility for enrollment  has been confirmed at the end of the screening 
period, the Investigator (or designee) should contact [CONTACT_797646] . Patients who do not meet 
eligibility criteria will be registered as screen failures. It is important that the study  staff 
reconfirm the patient’s willingness to continue in the study prior to randomizing the patient to 
a treatment.  
The planned treatment given to individual patients will be determined by a randomization 
scheme prepared by 
[CONTACT_797647]. For both DB periods, all 
patients will receive intranasal DFN- 02 10 mg  or a matching placebo  in a randomized 1:1 
treatment sequencing. As detailed in Section 6.1, patients  will treat 1 migr aine attack  in the 
DB1 treatment period and, if eligible, be re -randomized to enter into the DB2 treatment 
period. The IWRS will assign the appropriate study medication kit to each patient  for each 
treatment period. If a patient discontinues from the study after randomization, the patient ID 
number will not be reused, and the patient will not be allowed to re -enter the study.  Patients 
will be required to return unused study medication and t he eDiary  provided by [CONTACT_779].  
9.2 Selection of Doses in the Study  
The human dos
e range of DFP- 02 evaluated in the piv otal study (DFP -02-CD-009)26 and the 
4 pi[INVESTIGATOR_7602] (DFP -02-CD-008, 2419/11, 1931/09, 2010/10), was based upon doses of the 
marketed intranasal formulations of Imitrex nasal spray .22-25 The concentration of 0  
 was chosen based on early development work (data on file) to optimize the PK profile 
of sumatriptan.  These studies indicated no safety, tolerability, or clinically meaningful 
changes in vital signs and laboratory parameters.  The highest single- dose of sumatriptan in

CONFIDENTIAL  
 DFN- 02 for current and future clinical studies is 10 mg.  The safety and tolerability of this 
dose was evaluated in a long -term safety study (DFP -02-CD-010)27 that showed no new 
safety findings.  
9.3 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Patient  
At the end of the screening period, eligible patients will be randomized to receive study 
medication (DFN- 02 or
 a matching placebo) as described in Section 6.1. Information about 
use of study medicat
ion, predos e and postdos e assessments , and any rescue medication 
taken during the study will be recorded in the eDiary. For dosing information, see 
Section 8.1.  
9.4 Blinding  
In order to bli
nd the study treatment,  study medication ki ts with identical labeling appearance 
will be assigned unique kit numbers by [CONTACT_797648]. 
This is a DB study. All ra ndomization data will be kept strictly confidential and accessible 
only to authorized personnel until the time of unblinding after database lock at the end of 
study . Blinding is critical to the integrity of this clinical study; however, in the event of a 
medical emergency for an individual patient, in which knowledge of the treatment assignment is critical to the patient’s management, the blind for the patient may be broken by [CONTACT_737]  (or designee)  by [CONTACT_269289]. Before unblinding, the Investigator  (or 
designee)  should have determined that the treatment information is necessary to decide the 
patient’s immediate management, and must make every effort to contact [CONTACT_531783]. In many cases, especially if the emergency is clearly not related to study 
treatment, the problem may be properly managed without unblinding by [CONTACT_797649]. In cases of accidental unblinding or when the Medical 
Monitor cannot be contact[CONTACT_797650], the Medical Monitor should be contact[CONTACT_797651] .

CONFIDENTIAL  [IP_ADDRESS].1  eDiary Assessments  
Patient s will be provided with an eDiary at s creening (V1) to collect at least 1 migraine 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_797628], if randomized (V2), to continue to collect migraine date and time (for 
migraine attacks treated with study medication) and any non- study medication used to 
treat migraine in the study. At V2 and V3, patients will be re- instructed on the eDiary 
usage to ensure real -time entry of predose  and postdose recordings. (Predos e 
migraine assessments will be allowed to be recorded retrospectively in the event a 
patient  did not follow the instructions .) All patient s should be instructed to return the 
eDiary to the study site.  
At baseline (V2), patient s wil l complete the PPMQ -R questionnaire in the eDiary ; 
record the migraine pain start and end (date and time) when they get the migraine; 
record the baseline pain level ; record the functional disability  scale ; and record 
presence of symptoms and MBS (among nausea, photophobia, and p honophobia)  just 
before taking the study medication.  
At postdose, patient s will  record time to meaningful pain relief (based on their 
perception) , and time to pain- free after study medication within [ADDRESS_1100014] study medication dosing and use of rescue medication in the 
eDiary  at applicable timings.  
The following eDiary assessments will be recorded by [CONTACT_797653] 10.2.  
• Migraine 
pain and symptoms: 
o Migraine pain start and end (date and time) 
o Level of headache pain predose and at various time points after  (0 = none; 
1 = mild; 2 = moderate; 3 = severe)  
o Time t o meaningful pain relief (based on patient ’s percepti on) and time to 
pain- free after study medication 
o Migraine symptoms and MBS other than pain (nausea, photophobia, 
phonophobia, at predose,
 and at various time points, postdose)  
o  
• PPMQ -R: The PPMQ -R is a self -adm inistered satisfaction measurement for 
acute migraine treatment.   
• Functional disability scale (0 = no disability, able to function normally; 
1 = performance 
of daily activities mildly impaired, can still do everything but 
with difficulty; 2 = performance of daily activities moderately impaired, unable to 
do some things; 3 = performance of daily activities severely impaired, cannot do all or most things, bed rest may be necessary ).  
• Overall treatment satisfaction, measured by [CONTACT_797654] s, and 
the answer s will be assessed on a 7- point scale (1 = very satisfied, 2 = satisfied, 
3 = somewhat satisfied, 4 = neither satisfied nor dissatisfied, 5 = somewhat 
dissatisfied, 6 = dissatisfied, and 7 = very dissatisfied).  
• Study medication and rescue use. 
Visits may
 be scheduled as needed for AE management. Adverse event and 
concomitant medi
cation review should be performed at each unscheduled visit.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Events  
Adverse Event D efinition 
A
n AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study patient  
administered
 a study medication and which does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with this treatment.  A TEAE is an AE  with a start date on or after the initial 
dose of study medication and up to [ADDRESS_1100020] dose of study medication. An 
AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of the 
study medication , whether or not related to the study  medication. This includes an 
exacerbation of pre -existing conditions or events, intercurrent illnesses, drug 
interaction , or the significant worsening of the indication under investigation that is not 
recorded elsewhere in the eCRF . Anticipated fluctuations of pre -existing conditions, 
including the disease under study , that do not represent a clinically significant 
exacerbation or worsening need not be considered AEs . Migraine headaches will not 
be captured as AEs.  Migraine headaches will be captured by [CONTACT_797657] .  
For the purpose of the site’s data col lection responsibilities, any untoward event that 
started or worsened after the informed consent form (ICF) was signed  until the final 
end-of-study visit (inclusive)  is to be considered an AE.  
It is the responsibility of the Investigator  to document all AEs that occur during the 
study.  Adverse events  will be elicited by [CONTACT_99020]  a non -leading question, for 
example, “Have you experienced any new or changed symptoms since we last asked/since your last visit?”  Adverse events  should be reported on the appropriate 
page of the eCRF .

CONFIDENTIAL  Assessment of Severity 
Each AE will be assigned a category by [CONTACT_322258]:  
Mild An 
AE that is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_102] , causes minim al 
discomfort , and does not interfere with everyday activities.  
Moderate An AE that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal 
everyday acti
vities; intervention may be needed.  
Severe An AE that prevents normal everyday activities; treatment or other 
intervention usual
ly needed.  
If there is a change in severity of an AE, it must be recorded as a separate event. 
Assessment of C ausality 
Every
 effort will be made by [CONTACT_737]  t o assess the relationship of the AE, if any, 
to the study medication. Causality should be assessed using the categories presented 
in the following table:  
Not Related  The event is clearly due to extraneous causes (e .g., diseases, 
environment ), which should be s pecif ied if known ; or the event is 
most likely produced by [CONTACT_244130] ’s clinical 
state, therapeutic interventions , or concomitant therapy and does 
not follow a known response pattern to the study medication.  
Possibl y Related  The event is temporally rel ated to study medication use but can be 
explained by [CONTACT_11693]. Information on the effect of study 
product withdrawal may be lacking.  
Probabl y Related  The event is temporally related to study medication use and is 
consistent with known effects of the study medication and/or improves upon withdrawal of the study medication.  
Definitely Related  The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of 
study medication administration and/or follows a known response pattern to the study medicati on and could not have been produced 
by [CONTACT_244130] ’s clinical state, therapeutic 
intervention, or concomitant therapy and either occurs immediately 
following study medication administration or improves on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_797630] a positive reaction at the application site.  
Action Taken  
The Investigator  will report  the act ion taken in the appropriate section of the eCRF , as 
follows:  
• Dose not changed  
• Drug interrupted  
• Drug withdrawn  
• Not applicable 
• Unknown 
Follow -up of Adverse Events  
T
he Investi
gator  should follo w up on patient s with AEs until the event s are resolved or 
until, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689] , the event s have stabiliz ed or are determined to 
be chronic.  Details of AE resolution must be documented in the eCRF . Patients  who

Documentation and Reporting of Adverse Event s 
Adverse events  will be reported and documented in accordance with the procedures 
outlined in this section . Adverse event s will be reported from the time of informed 
consent  through V4/ET and documented on the r elevant eCRF  pages.  The following 
data should be documented for each AE: 
• Description of the symptom event  
• Classificat
ion of “serious” or “not serious ” 
• Severity  
• Dat
e of first occurrence and date of resolution (if applicabl e) 
• Action taken  
• Causal relationship 
• Outcome of event (unknown, recovered, not yet recovered, recovered with 
sequelae, death 
[with date and cause reported]).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Serious Adverse Events 
Serious Adverse Event Def
inition  
An S
AE is any untoward medical occurrence or effect that, at any  dose:  
• Results  in death.  
• Is li
fe-threatening . An AE is li fe-threatening if the patient  is at immediate risk of 
death from the event as it occurs (i.e., it does not include a reaction that might 
have caused death if it had occurred in a more serious form) . 
• Requires or prolongs i npatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1838]. C omplicat ions occurring during 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_797631].  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_122669] a pre -existing 
non-worsening condition is not, however, considered an AE.  The details of such 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_797632] . 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity . An AE is incapac itating or 
disabling if it results in a substantial or permanent disruption of the patient ’s ability 
to carry out normal life functions. 
• Is a c ongenital anom aly/birth defect. 
In addition, medical and scientific judgment  is required to  decide if prompt notification is 
required in situations other  than those defined for SAEs above (i.e. , any event that the 
Investigator  regards as serious that did not strictly meet the criteria above but that may 
have jeopardiz ed the patient  or required intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed above, or that would suggest any significant hazard, contraindication, side effect , 
or precaution that may be associated with the use of the study medication ).

notify the Sponsor  within 24 hou rs of occurrence of the SAE. An SAE report consists of 
the SAE form, the concomitant medication form, and any available supporting 
documentation (e.g. , hospi[INVESTIGATOR_44458]). A copy of the SAE form must be 
emailed within [ADDRESS_1100027].  at:

igato
r should not wait to receive additional information to fully document the 
event before notification of an SAE, though additional information may be requested.  
Where applicable, information from relevant laboratory results, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_63337] , 
and autopsy reports should be obtained.  
Instances of death, congenital abnormality , or an event that is  of sufficient clinical 
concern to influence the overall assessment of s afety, if brought to the attention of the 
Investigator  at any time after cessation of study medication administration and linked 
by [CONTACT_797658], should be reported to the study Medical Monitor .  
The Sponsor and/or INC Research will prom ptly notify all relevant parties of findings 
that could adversely affect the safety of patients, influence patients’ desire to continue 
in the study, impact the conduct of the study, or alter the Institutional Review Board 
(IRB) approval of the study. In addition, INC  Research, on behalf of the Sponsor, will 
expedite the reporting to all concerned Investigators and to the IRB (where required) of 
all adverse reactions that are both serious and unexpected. The Sponsor will  expedite 
the reporting of all adverse reactions that are both serious and unexpected and for which there is a reasonable possibility of their being caused by [CONTACT_7860], to 
the regulatory authorities as soon as possible but in no case later than 15 calendar days after becoming aware of their occurrence through an IND Safety Report 21 CFR 
320.31(d)(3).  
If the AE is fatal or life -threatening, and w
 ith reasonable possibility of its being related 
to the study medication, the Sponsor must also notify the FDA as soon as possible, but 
in no case later than 7 calendar days after becoming aware of its occurrence, by 
[CONTACT_797659] 21 CFR 320.31(d)(3).  
If the patient  took one or more sus pect medicinal product(s) other than the study 
medication, the relevant manufacturer(s) of this medicinal product(s) will be informed 
about the SAE by [CONTACT_797660] a reasonable 
possibility the concomitant drug caused the SAE. The Investigator must provide their causality assessment for any concomitant medication taken by [CONTACT_11581] t. 
Follow -up of Adverse Events 
All follow -up reports 
will be subject to the same reporting timelines as the Initial 
Reports. Within 24 hours of receipt of new information, the updated follow -up SAE 
form, along with any supporting documentation (e.g., patient discharge summary or 
autopsy reports), should be faxed or emailed to the Sponsor.

Unblinding Instructions  
Breaking the Blind 
The blind should 
be broken for all SAE IND safety reports that are judged t o be 
expedited reports for submission to FDA.  
The unblinding procedures and follow -up will be perfo rmed in accordance with the 
protocol and the Sponsor’s standard operating procedures (SOPs).  
The blind should not be broken at the study site level except in a medical emergency 
(where knowledge 
of the study medication received would affect the treatment of the 
emergency). For a medical emergency, the blind must only be broken following 
discussion on a case- by-case basis, at the discretion of the Investigator/treating 
physician/Sponsor.  
If the blind is broken, the date, time, and reason must be recorded in the patient ’s 
source rec
ord, eCRF, and any associated AE report.  
If an Investigator, site personnel performing assessments, or patient  is unblinded, the 
unbl
inding incident and unblinded patient  must be listed as a major protocol deviation.  
A patient  for whom the blind is broken will discontinue study medication and be 
scheduled for
 a safety follow -up visit and then discontinued from the study. The patient  
will be encouraged to stay in the study until the AE is resolved or stabilized.  
For all SAEs observed in the study considered to be drug related ,  a suspected 
unexpected serious adverse reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) will be reported by [CONTACT_797661]. All Investigators and the IRB will receive 
blinded reports. However, on the request of the IRB, the Sponsor will send unblinded 
reports directly to the IRB.  
Laboratory and Vital Signs Variables  
Vital signs and laboratory abnormalities should be reported as AEs if they are 
considered to be 
clinically significant, as per the Investigator’s judgment. If an abnormal 
laboratory value is associated with clinical signs and symptoms, the sign/symptom 
should be reported as an AE , and the associated abnormal laboratory result should be 
considered additional information.  
Pregnancy  
Although pregnancy is not an SAE, the procedures to report pregnancies will be the 
same as the p
rocedures detailed above for reporting SAEs.  
Female patient s should not be pregnant when entering the study and must not become 
pregnant during the study; please see Section [IP_ADDRESS]  for additional details. Following

CONFIDENTIAL  administration of study medication, any known cases of pregnancy in female patient s 
or male patient s who impregnate their female partners will be reported to the Sponsor 
within 24 hours of occurrence. All female patie nts will be withdrawn from the study and 
administration of study medication will be stopped. The pregnancy will be reported 
immediately by [CONTACT_80381]/emailing a completed Pregnancy Report to the 
Sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours of knowledge of the event. The pregnancy will not be processed as an SAE; however , the Investigator will follow the patient  until 
completion of the pregnancy and must assess the outcome in the shortest possible time but not more than 30 days after completion of the preg nancy. The Investigator 
should notify the Sponsor (or designee) of the pregnancy outcome by [CONTACT_17258] a follow -up Pregnancy Report. If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for 
immediate classification of an SAE (e.g., spontaneous or therapeutic abortion [any 
congenital anomaly detected in an aborted fetus is to be documented], stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly), the Investigator will report the event by [CONTACT_797662] a completed SAE form to the Sponsor (or designee) within [ADDRESS_1100032] been reported. Coronary vasospasm was

[IP_ADDRESS]  Unexpected Adverse Reactions  
Unexpected Adverse React
ion Definition  
An unexpected adverse reaction is any untoward and unintended response that is 
related to the ad
ministration of a  study medication  at any dose that is not consistent 
with the applicable product information (e.g., In vestigator’s B rochure for an 
unauthorized study medication or summary of product characteristics for an authori zed 
product).  
All S[LOCATION_003]Rs will be subject to expedited reporting.  The Sponsor  and/or INC Resear ch 
shall ensure that all relevant information about a S[LOCATION_003]R that is fatal or life- threatening 
is reported to the relevant competent authorities and the IRB within [ADDRESS_1100034]. Reddy’s Laboratories, Ltd. 
Protocol No. DFN-02-CD-[ADDRESS_1100035]. Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd.  [ADDRESS_1100036] been issued for s umatriptan : 
Sumatriptan should not be given to patients with documented ischemic or vasospastic 
CAD. It i
s strongly recommended that sumatriptan  not be given to patients in whom 
unrecognized CAD is predicted by [CONTACT_797663] (e.g., hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, smoker, obesity, diabetes, strong family history of CAD, female with surgical or physiological menopause, male over 40 years of age) unless a 
cardiovascular evaluation provides satisfactory clinical evidence that the patient is 
reasonably free of CAD and ischemic myocardial disease or other significant 
underlying cardiovascular disease. If, during the cardiovascular evaluation, the 
patient’s medical history or ECG investigations reveal findings indicative of, or consistent with, coronary artery vasospasm or myocardial ischemia, sumatriptan 
should not be administered.  For further details, please refer to the full Imitrex product

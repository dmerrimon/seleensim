2.2 Background & 
Rationale , 
Significance of 
Selected Topic & 
Preliminary Data   
  
Background:  
Bladder cancer is the 8th most common cancer in the US affecting 563,000 men and 
women annually. There are approximately 72,000 new cases diagnosed each year 
and roughly 16,000 patients die each year as a result of bladder cancer [1].  Many  of 
these patients are diagnosed with the cancer confined to the bladder. These patients 
often come to the operating room for an initial screening, biopsy(s), and/or 
resection(s). They require frequent tumor resections which may have invaded the 
bladder mu scle wall. This would require a deep level of anesthesia with muscle 
relaxation for safe and adequate tumor resection. This study will evaluate the use of 
a unique muscle relaxation reversal agent and its effect on the surgical condition, 
anesthetic provid ed, decrease of provider variability, as well as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_85284].  
 
Sugammadex, a selective relaxant binding agent, is used to speed up recovery of 
muscles after anesthesia. During some operations, your muscles must be completely 
relaxed.  This is ofte n required by [CONTACT_906620]. 
Muscle relaxation medications cause the muscles to relax; the general anesthetic 
includes muscle relaxants such as Esmeron  and Norcuron. Since respi[INVESTIGATOR_906614], artificial ventilation is required. Sugammadex 
reverses the effect of the muscle relaxation medications. After the operation 
spontaneous breathing is achieved [2].  
 
This study will involve the use of Sugammadex which was recently approved by [CONTACT_1556].  Sugammadex has been  used in Europe as Bridion  since 2008  and the specific 
drug information has been attached as an appendix item . [3] 
 
Rationale for this Study  
Bladder cancer affects about [ADDRESS_1272844] step for the 
diagnosis and treatment invol ves a transurethral resection of the  bladder (TURB)  
tumor. This is a highly skilled procedure due to the complexity of resecting a tumor 
from within the lumen of a thin, hollow organ: the bladder  [4]. 
Subclinical perforation of the bladder with extravasati on of urine has been reported in 
Protocol 2015 -1007  
October 5, 2017  
Page 4 of 13 
 
      MISP Template: Protocol  4 Final Version: 8/13/2010  as many as 58% of cases, when evaluation with immediate post TURB cystogram is 
used  [5]. Clinically detected perforation of the bladder has been reported in up to 
10% of cases and this can be a serious complication resultin g in leakage and 
systemic absorption of irrigation fluid and by [CONTACT_79602], vascular or bowel injury  [6].  
While extraperitoneal perforations can often be managed conservatively, large, 
intraperitoneal bladder perforations may require immediate treatment to prevent 
complications. In addition, perforations have been linked to reports suggesting that 
extravesical growth of tumor can occur in some patients when this happens  [7]. 
 
There are approximately [ADDRESS_1272845] a history of bladder cancer or other type of 
abdominal cancer which has affected the bladder. Due to a large number of 
anesthesia providers, there is a large  variability of intra -operative man agement of 
these patients. T he surgeon will often ask for a short period of complete muscle 
relaxation when electro cautery is used, in order to decrease spontaneous 
movement.  Because of the long duration of reversal wit h 
neostigmine/glycopyrrolate, patients are usually given lower doses of muscle 
relaxant, which increases the risk for bladder perforation. By [CONTACT_906621], 
the anesthesiologist expects to improve the surgical condition by [CONTACT_1541] a deeper 
level of mu scle relaxation with a standardized dose of muscle relaxant. A more 
predictable reversal of muscle relaxation will be provided, while minimizing post -
operative side effects. Neostigmine/glycopyrrolate usually is not administered 
immediately after the end o f surgery and, for a profound block, takes a considerable 
amount of time for reversal. Sugammadex may be administered much earlier and is 
expected to complete the reversal in several minutes. There has not been a study 
which provides an outcome in outpatie nt surgical or urological patients. Due to the 
high comorbidity of this population , maintenance of patient safety needs to be 
studied.  Therefore , this study will focus on the use of Sugammadex as a reversal 
agent for muscle relaxation during bladder surge ry to improve the patient’s ease of 
recovery [8,9].  
 
Rationale for Endpoints   
Patients who receive muscle relaxation reversal by [CONTACT_906622]/  
glycopyrrolate experience more post -operative nausea and vomiting than patients 
who don’t receive neostigmi ne. Patients also experience oral secretion and 
salivation, bradycardia, and tachycardia. These anesthetic complication s may 
prolong PACU stay , prolong recovery, or result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]; effecting and 
increasing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_85284] [ 10].  Variabil ity of response to Rocuronium as 
measured by [CONTACT_906623] a variability of 
doses given during outpatient surgery. By [CONTACT_2363] a standard dose of Rocuronium, an 
improved  recovery should be expected by [CONTACT_906624].  
 
Train of Four  
 
An Acceleromyograph (e.g. TOF -Watch SX) is a neuromuscular monitoring device 
which can objectively measure neuromuscular blockade reversal. Electrodes are 
placed over the ulnar nerve near the wrist, and a transducer is placed on the t humb. 
The ulnar nerve is stimulated and the response of the adductor pollicis muscle is 
recorded.  
 
The train -of-four (TOF) is a method that assesses the depth of neuromuscular 
blockade. In 15 -second cycles, with a 10 -second gap between cycles, the ulnar 
nerve is stimulated four times within two seconds and the twitch responses (T1 -T4) 
Protocol 2015 -1007  
October 5, 2017  
Page 5 of 13 
 
      MISP Template: Protocol  5 Final Version: 8/13/2010  are recorded. The height of T4 relative to T1 is known as the TOF ratio (TOFR). After 
administration of neuromuscular blockade, there is a fade in the latter twitch 
responses.  As the blockade deepens, the nerve stimulation will stop producing 
responses, starting with T4. The loss of T4, T3, T2, and T1 represents a blockade of 
80%, 85%, 90%, and 100% respectively. Once there are no twitch responses, the 
device switches to post -tetanic count (PTC) mode automatically. Once in PTC mode, 
the nerve is stimulated at 1 Hz over fifteen seconds. If there are no responses, there 
is five seconds of tetanic stimulation at 50 Hz. After a pause of three seconds, there 
are stimulations at 1 Hz over fifteen seconds. The number of responses during this 
fifteen second cycle constitutes the PTC. After reversal of neuromuscular blockade, 
the PTC will gradually increase. Once there are more than five consecutive 
responses, the device automatically goe s back to TOF mode [11]. Once TOFR 
reaches 0.9, the patient has recovered from the neuromuscular blockade and may 
be extubated. TOFR of 0.[ADDRESS_1272846] for neuromuscular blockade 
reversal, greatly reducing the risk of residual blockade [12].  
 
2.3 Study Design

      MISP Template: Protocol  6 Final Version: 8/13/[ADDRESS_1272847] Recruitment Plans and Consent Process  
 
Recruitment Plans:  
All patients who  are scheduled to have an outpatient cystoscopy procedure including 
transur ethral resection of the bladder (TURB ) at the outpatient Mays Clinic Surgical 
Center in Houston [LOCATION_007] will be pre -screened to see if they meet the enrollment 
criteria.  If so, the p atient will be approached by a member of the research study 
team.   
 
Informed Consent:  
Patients who are eligible to participate in the study will be approached by a member 
of the study team and informed about the trial.  Patients will be encouraged to 
discuss participation in the study with their family and given the opportunity to have 
any questions answered before written informed consent is sought.  
 
Randomization A ssignments and Results with be  mailed out  to the subjects after 
publication.  
 
Randomizatio n Method  
 
Once eligibility criteria have been confirmed patients will be randomized (1:1) to one 
of two groups using an automated on -line randomization scheme.  After assignment 
to one of the two treatment groups, a unique study number will be assigned.  Only 
one unique study number will be assigned per patient.  
 
This will be a double -blind study in that t he Surgeon and patient will be blinded to the 
randomization . Note:  The Anesthesiologist  and study personnel  will not  be blinded . 
 
Risks and Benefits  
 
The risks to participating in this study are minimal.  The patient may experience 
increased bradycardia.  Adequate safety measures, vigilance, and awareness will be 
taken by [CONTACT_108424].   By [CONTACT_906625] a ny additional risks than they would otherwise experience under the 
standard practice for this procedure.   
 
The benefits to utilizing Sugammadex as a reversal agent for a neuromuscular 
blockade may include improved quality of recovery and decreased time fo r recovery 
when compared to the current ( Neostigmine/ Glycopyrrolate).  
 
Duration of Study or Criteria for Terminating Participation in the Study  
 
Patients will be removed from study if the patient elects to withdraw from the study 
prior to general anesthesi a.  The reason for study removal and the date the patient 
was removed must be documented in the Case Report Form.   Additionally,  if there is 
a change in the patient’s health status or if the patient requires an alternative 
anesthesia plan that would contra dict the use of muscle relaxation, such as regional 
anesthesia or sedation . 
 
Data Collection and Follow -up for Withdrawn Subjects  
 
Data that has already been collected prior to notifying the  PI [INVESTIGATOR_906615] t’s wish to 
withdraw from the study will remain i n the study database. No additional information 
will be collected past this time point.

care (SOC) using Neostigmine/Glycopyrrolate on patients undergoing cystoscopy 
with bladder tumor resection procedure.  The primary objective is to determine if 
Sugammadex can improve muscle rec overy comparing to the SOC , measured by 
[CONTACT_906626] -of-four ratio of 
0.9.  Fifty-six patients will be randomized with a 1:1 ratio to receive either 
Sugammadex or Neostigmine/Glycopyrrolate.  
 
With a sample size of [ADDRESS_1272852] 8 0% power to detect an 
effect size of 0.809 in mean of the time from administration of neuromuscular 
blockade reversal to train -of-four ratio of 0.9 between the 
Neostigmine/Glycopyrrolate  arm and Sugamma dex arm.  The two-sided Type I error 
rate was 0.05, and the test statistic used was the two group t -test (nQuery Advisor 
7.0) Considering that 10% of the enrolled patients will be inevaluable, the trial need 
to enroll a total of [ADDRESS_1272853] the measurement on the primary endpoint.  
 
Patients will be randomized throug h CORe at MDACC.  There will not be any 
stratification factors .

      MISP Template: Protocol  10 Final Version: 8/13/2010   
Analysis Plans  
 
The analysis will be p erformed on evaluable patients.   Patients are considered to be 
evaluable if they don’t have any protocol violations and have the measurement on 
the primary endpoint.  Patients’ demographic information at baseline will be analyzed, 
with data summarized in ta bles listing the number of subjects per treatment arm in 
order to assess comparability. We will summarize the distribution of time from 
administration of neuromuscular blockade reversal to train -of-four ratio of 0.[ADDRESS_1272854] to compare continuous variables between two different 
patient groups.  The Fisher’s exact test will be applied to assess the association 
between two categorical variables.  Linear regression  may be utilized to assess the 
effects of patient prognostic factors on time from administration of neuromuscular 
blockade reversal to train -of-four ratio of 0.9.  
 
Toxicity data will be summarized by [CONTACT_47898].  The association between the 
types and  severity of toxicity and the treatment groups will be evaluated.  No formal 
statistical testing will be performed on these summary data.  
 
The dosage of Rocuronium has been reduced from 0.6 mg/kg to 0.45mg/kg after 
enrolling two patients (one on each treat ment arm). The Rocuronium dosage may 
impact the evaluation of the primary endpoint which is the time of recovery from 
neuromuscular block.   We will perform a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the impact of 
including these two patients in the analysis.

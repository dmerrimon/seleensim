Maternal  Smoking and Child Secondhand Smoke Exposure (SHSe)  
 
Smoking  among  women  is sufficiently  important  to the U.S. public  health  to have  warranted  two separate  reports  
of the U.S. Surgeon General devoted exclusively to the topic  (USDHHS,1980; 2001). Smoking prevalence is 
unevenly distributed in the  U.S. population, being highly concentrated among individuals with low 
3

 socioeconomic status, especially low educational attainment.  Such  differential  smoking  rates  contribute  directly  
to the unsettling  problems  of health  disparities  that are growing in  the U.S. (e.g.,  Margerison -Zilko,  2012).  Not 
surprisingly,  there  is considerable  consensus  on the need  to reduce  smoking among  disadvantaged  women,  
especially  maternal  smokers  (e.g.,  Graham et  al., 2007;  Higgins  & Chilcoat,  2009;  Kandel  et at., 2009).  
 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_821501] -hand -smoke exposure ( SHSe ), estimates are 
that 85% of children from low -income U.S. families  experience  chronic  exposure  (Cornelius  et al., 2003;  
Halterman  et at., 2010;  USDHHS,  2007).  Children  exposed  to SHS are at increased risk for numerous serious 
health problems, including sudden infant death syndrome, more severe asthma, lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_18073], 
and chronic middle ear disease, and maternal smoking is a particularly sign ificant contributor  to this increased  
morbidity  and mortality  (Blackburn  et at., 2005;  Schoenberger  et at., 2003;  USDHHS,  2007).  SHSe is also a 
substantial  economic  burden  on the U.S. healthcare  system,  being  estimated  to increase  direct  medical  and life-
lost costs  by » $5 billion  annually  (Aligne &  Stoddard,  1997;  Sisko  et al., 2009).  
 
Interventions  developed  to reduce  children's  SHSe  have  aimed  to (1) decrease  parental  smoking  around  their 
children,  (2) increase  parental  smoking  cessation,  or (3) both.  Since  smoking  by a child’s  mother  is a particularly  
significant  contributor  to SHSe, interventions have typi[INVESTIGATOR_821502]. Regarding efforts to 
decrease smoking around children, studies testing  relatively  low-intensity  interventions  (e.g.,  written  materials,  
brief advice)  have  failed  to change  exposure  levels  (e.g., Irvine  et at., 1999;  Wakefield  et al., 2002),  while  those  
testing  more  intensive  interventions  have  had more  success  decreasing children’s  SHSe,  with at least  some  
instances  of biochemically -verified  changes  (see Hovell  et at., 2009).  
 
The results  of Hovell  et al. suggest  that interventions  to help mothers  smoke  away  from their children  may yield 
important benefits.  Still, as the Surgeon  General’s  report  on children  and SHSe  notes,  “the single  best way [for a 
smoker]  to protect  their family  from secondhand  smoke  is to quit smoking."  Unfortunately,  that is where  substantial  
improvements  are sorely  needed  in treatment development efforts. We know of only two reports focused 
exclusively on developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a smoking cessation intervention  for mothers  of young  children  (Curry  et at., 2003;  
Wall et at., 1995). The  interventions  tested  were  brief,  low-cost interventions  (e.g.,  brief advice,  written  materials,  
telephone  outreach)  that could  be readily  integrated  into pediatric  care.  Both Curry  et al. and Wall et at. reported  
differences  in self-reported  point -prevalence  smoking  levels  (14%  vs. 7% at 12 mos,  and 6%  vs. 3% at 6 mos,  
respectively),  but in neither  case  could  those  self-reported  changes  be biochemically  verified.  Of course, there  is 
considerable  social  pressure  on parents  to underreport  smoking  (e.g.,  Hovell  et al., 2009;  Lund  et at., 2004)  and 
hence it is not unexpected that self -reported cessation rates might be  inflated.  
 
Clearly,  more  effective  smoking -cessation  interventions  for mothers  are needed  to meet  the public  health  priority  of 
reducing SHSe  among  children  (USDHHS,  2010).  We recognize  that maternal  smoking  cessation  will not 
eliminate  SHSe  among children  since  many  (-40%)  live with more  than one smoker  (King  et at., 2009).  However,  
the evidence  is clear  that smoking mothers  are the primary  contributors  to their children's  SHSe,  making  them  the 
obvious  first target  (Blackburn  et al., 2005; Schoenberger  et al., 2003;  USDHHS,  2007).  The overarching  goal of 
this project  is to develop  an efficacious,  cost-effective incentive -based smoking cessation intervention that is 
combined with state -of-the-art smoking -cessation pharmacotherapy practices to optimize outcomes.  
 
More Intensive and Effective Cessation Interventions  
Brief,  low-cost interventions.  A notable  limitation  discernible  in the literature  on smoking -cessation  for mothers  
of young children  is an over-reliance  on brief,  low-cost interventions  with broad  reach  that can be readily  delivered  
as part of routine medical  care,  etc. This is a public  health  approach  where  the overarching  goal is to improve  
population  health  over time. The dramatic  decline  in smoking  prevalence  in the U.S. over the past 45 years  is 
evidence  of the effectiveness  of that approach (Irvin Vidrine et al., 2009). While there is widespread recognition 
of the importance of that accomplishment, there is also growing  recognition  of the need  to compliment  the public -
health  approach  with more  intensive  interventions  targeting  the most vulnerable  populations who  often  are 
underserved  by [CONTACT_821530]  (Abrams,  2007;  Frohlich  & Potvin,  2008;  Hiscock et al., 2012;  Irvin Vidrine  et 
al., 2009;  Satchel  & Higginbotham,  2008).  What  is driving  much  of this recognition  of the need  for adjustments in 
tobacco -control strategies is the leveling off of the declines in smoking prevalence in the U.S. and other 
developed  countries  during  the past decade,  largely  attributable  to the difficulties  encountered  in decreasing  
smoking  among more economically -disadvantaged  individuals.  
 
This same  heavy  reliance  on brief,  low-cost interventions  is also true of efforts  to promote  smoking  cessation  during  
pregnancy where  results  have  similarly  fallen  short.  For example,  we know  of at least  16 controlled  trials  in that 
area examining  variations of  brief advice  and pregnancy -specific  self-help materials  (see Lumley  et at., 2009;  
Melvin  & Gaffney,  2004).  Only four of those trials  resulted  in significant  differences  in antepartum  cessation  rates  
(Ershoff  et al., 1989;  Hjalmarson  et at., 1991;  Windsor  et al., 1985; 1993) and just one trial produced a 
demonstrable improvement in birth outcomes (Ershoff et al., 1990). Such exclusive  focus  on brief interventions  
seems  incompatible  with the extensive  evidence  linking  cigarette  smoking  with serious adverse health 
4 
 
Human subjects protocol f orm 7/19/19  
 consequences for infants and children (Rogers,  2009).  
 
Regarding  the general  population  of smokers,  the 2008  Clinical  Practice  Guidelines  on Treating  Tobacco  are quite  
clear  in concluding  that intensive  treatment  is more  effective  than brief treatment,  intensive  treatments  are 
appropriate  for all tobacco users  willing  to participate  in them,  and that patient  satisfaction  is higher  with intensive  
compared  to brief interventions  (Fiore  et al.,  2008).  We believe  that these  same  recommendations  need  to be 
followed  with maternal  smokers.  There  are at least  two areas  of treatment  development  research  for smoking  
cessation  during  pregnancy  where  investigators  are examining  more intensive  treatment interventions  (i.e., 
pharmacotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_821503]).  Regarding  pharmacotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014],  there  have been  several  promising  
trials reported  on NRT with  pregnant  smokers  and important  ongoing research  (see Oncken  & Kranzler, 2009  for a 
review).  Two of the more  promising  findings  have  involved  increased  cessation  rates  with combined  behavioral  
and pharmacological  interventions  (Pollak  et al., 2007)  and improved  birth outcomes  with NRT despi[INVESTIGATOR_821504] (Oncken et at., 2008). There is little question that pharmacotherapy has an 
important contribution to make to improving smoking -cessation outcomes with maternal  smokers.  
 
Incentives  
We feel the same  is true regarding  financial  incentives.  Several  controlled  trials  conducted  by [CONTACT_821531] -based intervention where 
women earn vouchers exchangeable for retail items contingent on bioche mically -verified abstinence 
significantly increases antepartum and postpartum smoking abstinence, improves birth outcomes, and 
increases breastfeeding duration among economically disadvantaged women (Donatelle et at., 2000; Heil et 
al., 2008; Higgins et al ., 2004; Higgins et al., 2010a; Higgins et al., 2010b).  That is the model  that we are 
proposing  in this application.  The treatment  effects  obtained  with incentives  in pregnant smokers,  a notoriously  
difficult  population  of smokers  to treat,  are encouraging  regarding  the potential  utility  of this approach  for treating  
other  groups  of recalcitrant  smokers  as well. In the most  comprehensive  meta -analysis  on cessation  treatments  
for pregnant smokers, financial incentives produced a 24% average difference between experimental and 
control conditions compared to 6% across all treatment approaches (Lumley et al., 2009). Additionally, in an 
economic analysis of the interventions  reviewed  in that comprehensive  meta -analysis  comparing  financial  
incentives,  cognitive  behavioral  strategies, stages of change, feedback, pharmacotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and “other" 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_821505]’s National Institute for Health and Clinical 
Excellence (NICE), financial incentives pro duced the highest net cost benefit per intervention, with a net 
benefit of 2,261 pounds or $3,[ADDRESS_1138759] of the intervention (Taylor, 2009, 
http://www.nice. org.uk/nicemedia/live/[ZIP_CODE]/[ZIP_CODE]/[ZIP_CODE].pdf}.  We believe it is important to include cost -
effectiveness analyses  in this next generation  of incentives  treatment -outcome  studies  and we are proposing  to do 
so in the proposed  study with  mothers  of young  children.  Importantly,  there  is evidence  from the smoking -
cessation  literature  that cost-effectiveness increases  with increasing  intensity  of smoking -cessation  
interventions  (Cromwell  et at., 1997).  
 
Pharmacotherapy  
We know of only four controlled studies that experimentally investigated the effects of combining abstinence -
contingent incentives with smoking -cessation pharmacotherapy and all examined only short -term abstinence 
(< 3 wks). Our group conducted a controlled study with 14 schizophrenic outpatients using a within -subjects 
design, another challenging population with high smoking  prevalence  and notoriously  poor quit rates  (Tidey  et al., 
2002). During  three  5-day periods,  patients  were exposed  to incentives  for smoking  abstinence  combined  with 
transdermal  21 mg NRT,  incentives  combined  with placebo,  and non -contingent  incentives  combined  with placebo.  
Incentives  increased  abstinence  compared  to the non-contingent  control, but  NRT did not improve  outcomes  
above  incentives  plus placebo.  Similarly,  Tidey  et al. (2011)  reported  a between -groups study  with 57 
schizophrenic  smokers  randomized  to 300 mg/day  bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_821506] a non-contingent  control  condition.  Over  a 22-day study  period,  incentives  
decreased cotinine  levels  compared  to the control  condition,  but bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_821507].  The two other  studies  were  conducted  with smokers  without  
serious  mental  illness  (Perkins  et al., 2008;  2010).  Both studies  used  a 2 x 2 crossover  design  involving  5-day study  
periods  comparing  incentives  vs. no incentives and active medication vs. placebo. The medications were 21 mg 
transdermal NRT (Perkins et al., 2008) and 1 mg b.i.d. varenicline (Perkins et al., 2010). Across both studies, 
treatment effects were additive: incentives and medication each independently  increased  absti nence  and when  
combined  produced  abstinence  levels  greater  than those  observed  with either alone. To our knowledge, the 
proposed trial will represent the first experimental examination of the effects of combining incentives with 
pharmacotherapy compared to  incentives alone on longer -term abstinence.  
 
Behavioral Economics as a Conceptual Framework for Understanding Parental Smoking  
The high rates of SHSe described above can be difficult to comprehend considering that the adverse 
consequences are increasingly  well known  and there  are more  effective  smoking -cessation  treatments  available  
now than ever before.  Studies indicate that parents are well aware of the adverse consequences of SHSe on 
5 
 
Human subjects protocol f orm 7/19/19  
 children’s health (Halterman et al., 2010), including smoking parents (Johansson et al., 2005). A report by  
[CONTACT_821532] -Gittens (2002) also provides insight into the smoking -cessation  intentions  of parents  with young  
children.  In this study  of 102 disadvantaged  parents,  82% had intentions  to quit  but only 21% actually  made  a quit 
attempt.  Importantly,  66% reported  that they would  be interested  in joining  a smoking - cessation program and/or 
trying a smoking -cessation medication. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_821508], why don’t these mothers stop  smoking?  
 
Behavioral economics offers potential answers to that question . Results from several studies demonstrate that 
smokers discount  the value  of delayed  reinforcement  more  than nonsmokers,  a phenomenon  known  as delay  
discounting  (DD)  (Bickel  et al., 2007). This difference can be summarized as smokers showing a greater 
preference for more immediate, smaller magnitude  rewards  (e.g.,  smoking  a cigarette)  over more  delayed,  larger -
magnitude  rewards  (e.g.,  a healthy  child).  Moreover, other  studies  have  shown  that individuals  with less education  
discount  more  than those  with more  education  (e.g.,  de Wit et al., 2007).  Additionally,  two studies  by [CONTACT_821533]  (Washio  et al., 
2011;  Yoon  et al., 2007).  Yoon  et al. (2007)  demonstrated  that among  women  who quit smoking  during  pregnancy  
(N=48),  those  who discounted  more  at baseline  were  also more  likely  to relapse  back  to smoking  by 6-months  
postpartum.  Using  data from our research  clinic  for cocaine  abusers,  Washio  et al. (2011)  demonstrated  that DD of 
hypothetical monetary reinforcers predicted the amount of abstinence achieved among 36 outpatients receiving 
incentives with relatively low - or high -magnitude monetary value. DD predicted the number of weeks of cocaine 
abstinence, adjusting for treatment  condition  (p = .02). Interestingly,  greater  discounters  achieved  less 
abstinence  in the low-magnitude  (p = .02), but not in the high-magnitude  (p = .30) incentive  conditions,  suggesting  
that the high-magnitude  incentives  were  helpi[INVESTIGATOR_821509].  
 
Other behavioral -economic tasks also have important potential contributions to make toward understanding 
persistent smoking among disadvantaged populations and individual differences in response to incentives and 
other interventions. One instrument that we are proposing to examine in this application uses a simulated 
cigarette purchase task (CPT) to generate demand curves for smoking -produced rein forcement (e.g., Murphy 
et al., 2011). Individuals report the number of cigarettes they would smoke in a hypothetical day across a 
range of prices per cigarette. In approximately 20 min, the task generates a rich array of measures of demand 
and price sensi tivity, including breakpoint, and intensity and elasticity of demand among others. The same 
task has been used effectively to assess individual price sensitivity with alcohol and opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556] 
(Jacobs & Bickel, 1999; Murphy et at., 2009), differences between smokers with vs. without serious mental 
illness (Mackillop & Tidey, 2011), and has been shown to predict treatment outcome in problem drinkers 
(MacKillop & Murphy,  2007).  
 
Incentives can be conceptualized as altering the price of smoking by [CONTACT_821534]. As such, there is a sound 
theoretical rationale to anticipate that individual differences in elasticity of demand (i.e., sensitivity to pri ce) 
may predict sensitivity to the incentives, with successful treatment response corresponding to greater price 
sensitivity. Similarly, NRT can be conceptualized as substituting an inferior form of nicotine reinforcement for 
cigarette smoking. As such, th ere is a sound theoretical rationale for anticipating that individuals who are 
already more sensitive to price in the absence of the inferior substitute (at baseline) may show even greater 
elasticity of demand when NRT is available to substitute for smokin g. That is, they would be expected to 
benefit more from the combined incentives + NRT intervention than those with more inelastic baseline 
demand curves. We will explore such relationships in the proposed study and believe that doing so has the 
potential t o enhance understanding of the processes underpi[INVESTIGATOR_821510], individual differences in treatment response, differences between treatment conditions, and 
provide future targets for improving interventions wi th disadvantaged smokers.  
 
Summary  
Developi[INVESTIGATOR_821511] -effective interventions to increase smoking cessation among disadvantaged 
mothers and reducing SHSe among their children is an important U.S. public health priority. The financial 
incentive s model that we are proposing is effective with other treatment -recalcitrant populations and we 
believe has the potential to meet this important public -health challenge. Indeed, results from the subsets of 
mothers who have participated in our prior trials on incentives for smoking -cessation among pregnant women 
provide preliminary empi[INVESTIGATOR_821512]. Because of the prevalence of heavy smoking among 
disadvantaged smokers, we will also examine whether combining incentives with pharmacotherapy  improves 
outcomes above incentives alone. Behavioral -economic theory suggests that the efficacy of the cessation 
intervention that we are proposing is at least in part attributable to providing smaller, more immediate 
incentives for success that acts to b ridge the temporal delay to the larger naturalistic rewards of improved 
health outcomes for mother and child. We will continue to investigate the behavioral -economic processes 
involved in smoking among disadvantaged women and how these processes relate to individual differences in 
treatment response.

Objectives:   Clearly state the primary and secondary objective(s) of the study.  
 
Primary aim  # 1: develop an efficacious, cost -effective smoking -cessation intervention for mothers of 
young children. 250 smoking mothers of children  ages  11 yrs will be recruited from our University hospi[INVESTIGATOR_821517]: (1) usual care for quitting smoking and protecting children  from SHSe;  (2) usual  care combined  
9 
 
Human subjects protocol f orm 7/19/19  
 with financial  incentives  for biochemically -verified  maternal  smoking  abstinence;  (3) usual care combined 
with financial incentives plus pharmacotherapy using innovative procedures to optimize medication 
efficacy. We will conduct cost -effectiveness analyses of the three interventions. We hypothesize that each 
of the interventions with incentives will increase smoking abstinence compared to usual care alone, but 
that the largest magnitude and most cost - effective treatment effects will be achieved by [CONTACT_821536].  
 
Primary aim # 2 : determine whether maternal smoking cessation decreases objective measures of SHSe i n 
children. Urine samples will be collected from the youngest child of each maternal participant at each follow -
up assessment for determination of cotinine levels. We will examine this outcome by (a) comparing between 
treatment conditions and (b) comparing  children of abstainers versus smokers independent of treatment 
condition. We hypothesize that (a) both incentives interventions will decrease child cotinine levels 
significantly more than usual care alone and (b) that SHSe levels will be significantly low er among children 
of abstainers than smokers.  
 
Secondary aim : utilize behavioral -economic measures to improve understanding of treatment process and 
predict outcomes. Women will complete smoking -price sensitivity and delay -discounting tasks at study 
intake  and follow -up assessments. We hypothesize that cigarette price sensitivity will increase as an orderly 
function of treatment intensity and differ between treatment conditions, and that steeper baseline 
discounting (i.e., greater impulsivity) will predict smoking abstinence at follow - up assessments after 
controlling for the influence of treatment . 
 
 
METHODS AND PROCEDURES  
 
Study Design:  Describe the research design, including a description of any new methodology and its advantage over existing 
methodologies.  
 
This study  is a randomized  clinical  trial with three  treatment  conditions.  Treatment  conditions  will last for [ADDRESS_1138766] of  either  A: usual  care for reducing  SHSe .  B: provisions  of incentives  contingent  upon  biochemically -verified  
maternal  smoking abstinence  or C: the incentive  program  combined  with provision  of and support  in using  of 
pharmacotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  Outcome measures will include maternal abstinence rates, child cotinine exposure and the interaction 
of behavioral economic measures and treatment  success.  This extended  treatment  period  of combined  incentive  and 
pharmacotherapy  support  represents  a novel  and intense  approach  to reducing  smoking  and second -hand  smoke  
exposure  in these  vulnerable  populations.  
 
 
Procedures:   Describe all procedures (sequentially) to which human participants will be subjected. Identify all procedures that are 
considered experimental and/or procedures performed exclusively for research purposes. Describe the types, frequency and 
duration of te sts, study visits, interviews, questionnaires, etc.  
 
Note:  A clinical research protocol may involve interventions that are strictly experimental or it may involve some aspect of resear ch 
(e.g., randomization among standard treatments for collection and ana lysis of routine clinical data for research purposes). It is 
important for this section to distinguish between interventions that are experimental and/or carried out for research purpose s 
versus those procedures that are considered standard therapy. In add ition, routine procedures performed solely for research 
purposes (e.g., additional diagnostic/follow -up tests) should be identified.  
 
 
Screening:  
Participants  will be recruited  primarily  from our university -affiliated  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]’s  pediatric  practice  but also other  pediatric  
and family  medicine  practices  throughout  the county  in which  our clinic  is located  as well as from the local office  for 
Women,  Infants, and Children (WIC). All mothers attending a pediatric visit with their child will complete a brief self -
administered smoking - screening  form (attached).  Those  who endorse  smoking  in the prior 7 days  and having  a child s 
11 years  of age will be invited for an intake  assessment.  
 
Intake Assessment:  
The study  intake  assessment  battery  will examine  the following  seven  areas:  (1) Socio -demographics:  age, yrs of 
education, race/ethnicity,  height/weight,  marital  status,  and health  insurance  status.  (2) Smoking  history:  age started  
smoking,  average number  of cigarettes  smoked  per day, time to first cigarette  in the morning,  number  of previous  quit 
attempts,  number  of other smokers in the household, nicotine dependence/tolerance (Fagerstrom & Schneider, 1989), 
10 
 
Human subjects protocol f orm 7/19/19  
 and nicotine withdrawal (Hughes & Hatsukami,  1986). Smoking  Timeline  Follow -back  (TLFB)  interviews  will be 
conducted  (Brown  et at., 1998)  to characterize fluctuations  in daily smoking  rates  and associated  child SHSe.  (3) 
Smoking  attitudes:  motivation  to stop,  confidence  in ability  to stop,  intention  to quit, and measures  of perceived  stress.  
(4) Biochemical  verification  of maternal  smoking  status  and baseline SHSe  of the child:  Maternal  breath  CO (pi[INVESTIGATOR_821518],  Bedfont  Scientific  Ltd) and urine  cotinine  levels  (Viva -E Enzyme  lmmunoassay  Testing  (EMIT)  
System,  Seimens)  will be measured.  The urine  cotinine  level of each  target  child will be measured  to establish  a 
baseline  of SHSe.  For children  still in diapers,  urine  samples  will be collected  by [CONTACT_1299]  a sterile cotton  pad in the 
diaper  (e.g.,  Hovell  et al., 2009).  (5) SHSe:  Mothers  will be queried  regarding  their smoking  in the house during  
workdays  and non-workdays  in the past 7 days,  their child’s  SHSe  during  the past 7 days  related  to their smoking  and 
that of others in the home as well as outside the home (e.g., grandparents home) (Hovell et al., 2009). Exposure 
will be quantified  as # of cigs smoked  while  the child was in the room  or car. (6) Medical  history/Mental  health  status:  
any current medical concerns problems, prescription and over -the-counter medications currently used, allergies, 
surgical, gynecologic, and family history, immunizations, substance abuse history, and review of systems, lifetime 
history of depression, general psychiatri c symptoms (Brief Symptom Inventory, Derogatis, 1993), and current 
depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory,  Beck  & Beck,  1972).  If a subject expresses  any thoughts of harm  
to self or others  the subject will be taken  to a private  room  and the staff member  will sit with them  and call Crisis  Services  
(7) Behavioral  economics:  mothers  will complete the  delay  discounting  task (Johnson  & Bickel,  2002)  and the 
simulated  cigarette  purchase  task (Murphy  et al., 2011).  Permission  will be requested  of all mothers  for project  staff to 
review  child health  records  through  48 wks after the quit date,  but permission will not be a requirement for  
participation.  
Treatment Conditions  
Participants  will be randomly  assigned  to one of three  treatment  conditions:  (1) usual  care for smoking  cessation  and 
protecting children  from SHSe,  (2) usual  care combined  with incentives  for objectively  verified  smoking  abstinence,  and 
(3) usual  care combined with incentives and pharmacotherapy using innovative procedures to enhance its efficacy. 
We will stratify assignment  on four variables  that may influence  maternal  and child outcomes:  (1) maternal  smoking  level 
(< vs. > 20 cigs/day),  (2) maternal  educational  attainment  (< vs. > 12 yrs), (3) the number  of smokers  living  with the target  
child (1 vs. a 2), and (4) whether  the target  child is < vs. > [ADDRESS_1138767]  
complex  of the interventions  and includes  the protocols  to be used  in the other  treatment  conditions.  
 
Usual  care. The 2008  Clinical  Practice  Guidelines  for smoking  cessation  recommends  that medical  providers  should  at 
a minimum  implement  the 5As (Fiore  et al., 2008).  To assure  that referring  pediatric  services  are at least  acquainted  with 
the 5As,  our staff will conduct  office -based  training  sessions  with all referring  practices  prior to the start of study  
recruitment  and once  annually  throughout  the course  of the study  using  training  procedures  developed  previously  by 
[CONTACT_821537].  As part of training  in the 5As, providers  will be encouraged  to refer 
smokers  to the Vermont  Quit Network  that is supported  by [CONTACT_821538]  
(http://www.vtquitnetwork.org).  This network  offers  a wide range  of free cessation  services,  including  nicotine  
replacement  therapy  wherein  free nicotine  patches,  gum,  or lozenges  will be mailed  directly  to the participant's  home.  
There  are basic  web-based  modules  on preparing  to quit, motivating  oneself  during the  quit process,  a review  of the 
reasons  that people  smoke,  evaluating  whether  pharmacotherapy  may help,  developi[INVESTIGATOR_007]  a quit plan,  and sustaining  
abstinence.  Additionally,  they provide  free online  coaching  that includes  forums  with former  smokers  and others who 
are currently trying to quit, or individual smoking -cessation phone counseling, or in -person smoking -cessation group 
counseling  offered  in the local community  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600].  Importantly,  we will have  no involvement  with the content  of 
counseling  or other smoking -cessation services that might be routinely offered through the referring medical practices 
aside from us providing the once  yearly  workshop  on how to implement  the 5As and recommending  them  to refer women  
to the Vermont  Quit Network. Our  goal is for this condition  to represent  usual  care and not standard  of care as stipulated  
in the Clinical  Practice  Guidelines. As discussed above in the section on follow -up assessments, we will assess all 
mothers on smoking -cessation recommendations and services received through their children’s health -care 
providers, which is information that can be considered in cost -effectiveness and other  analyses.  
 
Usual care + incentives. Participants in this condition will rece ive the usual -care services from their providers 
described above  plus a 12-week  program  of monetary  incentives  for verified  smoking  abstinence  (maximum  earnings  
= $810  over 12 wks) that will be implemented by [CONTACT_821539]. The initial smoking negative test (< 6 ppm) will be 
worth $10. Each consecutive negative test increases the incentive by $2.50, with the 2nd consecutive negative test 
worth $12.50, the 3rd negative  test $15, the 4th test $17.50,  etc. Incentive  value  continues  to escalate  upward  based  
on consecutive  negative  test results  with a maximum  value  of $50. A positive  test or failure  to submit  a specimen  for a 
scheduled  test resets  incentive  value back  to the initial  $10. This reset  contingency  protects  against  relapse  once  a 
period  of abstinence  has been  achieved  (Roll & Higgins,  2000). Two  consecutive  negative  tests  following  a reset  will 
return  incentives  back  to the value  that they were  at prior to  the positive  test result.  Based  on prior studies  (Heil et at., 
2008),  we anticipate  mothers  will earn about  40% ($324)  of the maximum  possible.  Use of NRT or other

condition,  but study  staff will not offer them  the pharmacotherapy  protocol  described  below.  Based on  our prior studies  
with incentives  for smoking  cessation  and those  of others  in disadvantaged  populations,  we are confident that  there  will 
be minimal  ongoing  pharmacotherapy  use in this condition  or the usual  care condition  above  (<10%)  (Coleman  et at.,

protocols described  above  and the following  pharmacotherapy  protocol:  (1) A clear  recommendation  will be provided  by 
[CONTACT_821540].  For those  who agree,  we will immediately  register  them  with the Vermont  Quit Network  if they 
have  not already  done so  asking  for a supply  of free NRT as part of the registration  and using  our clinic  address  as the 
delivery  site. We will have NRT  already  available  onsite  that we will use so that the pharmacotherapy  protocol  can be 
implemented  immediately  after a woman  agrees  to use it. That supply  can be replenished  as needed  when  the 
requested  package  arrives  from the state.  We will use the medications provided through the Vermont Quit Network 
(over -the-counter NicoDerm CQ, GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare). (2) Following their quit date, participants 
will be encouraged to follow a standard 10-wk course of transdermal  NRT,  using  the 21 mg/24  hr patch  for 6 more  
wks, the 14mg/24  hr patch  for 2 wks, and the 7 mg/24  hr patch  for the final 2 wks. Additionally, participants will be 
encouraged to use nicotine lozenges (or gum if someone objects to the lozenges)  in combination  with transdermal  
NRT beginning  on their quit date as a behavioral  substitute  for smoking.  We will use Commit  (GlaxoSmithKline  
Consumer  Healthcare)  brand  of [ADDRESS_1138768] nurse will assess medication side effects at each visit, and recommend 
adjustments in dose and other aspects of the regimens described above as warranted and in consultation with the 
clinic medica l director.  
 
Abstinence -monitoring  schedule.  Beginning  with the quit date,  all mothers  will report  to the clinic  or be met at a 
convenient location  according  to a predetermined  12-week  schedule.  Week  1 of the cessation  effort  includes  five 
consecutive  days  of 1 x daily  abstinence  monitoring.  In Weeks  2-8, abstinence  monitoring  will be reduced  to twice  
weekly  and then to once  weekly  for the  remaining  4 weeks  (Weeks  9-12). Abstinence  will be defined  as a breath  carbon  
monoxide  level < 6 ppm for purposes  of implementing the incentives program. To keep the frequency of clinic contacts 
and data collected comparable across treatment conditions  in this trial, women  assigned  to the usual -care only condition  
will receive  $15 vouchers  independent  of smoking status  for attending  the abstinence -monitoring  sessions.  This will 
assure  comparable  levels  of attendance  across  conditions.  When  the influence  of such  non-contingent  incentives  on 
smoking  or other  drug abstinence  was examined  in a meta -analysis,  it was  identical  to providing  no incentives  at all 
(Lussier  et al., 2006).  Thus,  this will be done  in the proposed  study  for research purposes  only.  TLFB  assessments  will 
be completed  at each  visit to assess  any smoking  since  last visit as well as use of NRT or  other  smoking -cessation  
medications.  Following  this assessment  subjects  will be randomized  to one of three  treatment groups.  
 
Follow -up Assessments  
The assessment  battery  will be completed  with all mothers  and children  again  at 6, 12, 24, and 48 wks after intake  by [CONTACT_821541]. All subjects will be compensated $[ADDRESS_1138769]  achieved  high rates  of follow -up compliance  (85-90%)  in prior studies  with 
this level of compensation  and anticipate  the same  in the proposed  study.  Urine  specimens  collected  from mothers  and 
children  at the follow -up assessments  will be sent to an outside  laboratory  for cotinine  testing  using  gas chromatography  
(GC)  with maternal and liquid chromatography -mass spectrometry (LC -MS/MS) for child specimens; maternal specimens 
will also be assessed for tobacco  alkaloids  anabasine  and anatabine  using  LC-MS/MS  to discriminate  between  cotinine  
from smoking  vs. NRT use (Jacob  et al., 2002).  Participants  will complete  a brief yes-no questionnaire  consisting  of five 
questions  adapted  from prior studies  with women  on smoking -cessation  services  received  (e.g.,  Sherman  et al., 2005):  
(1) Has your child’s  doctor  talked  with you  about  smoking  cessation  since  last assessment?  (2) Has your child’s  doctor  
referred  you to a smoking -cessation  clinic  or related  service  (e.g.,  online/phone  counseling)  since  last assessment?  (3) 
Have  you attended  a smoking -cessation  clinic  (or online or phone counseling) since last assessment? (4) Has your 
child’s doctor recommended or prescribed a smoking - cessation  medication  (e.g.,  nicotine  patch/gum/lozenges,  
Zyban)  since  last assessment?  (5) Have  you used  any smoking - cessation  medications  since  last assessment?  Those  
reporting  use of a pharmacotherapy  will complete  a TLFB  interview  to characterize use since last  assessment.

Statistical Considerations:  Delineate the precise outcomes to be measured and analyzed. Describe how these results will be 
measured and statistically analyzed. Delineate methods used to estimate the required number of subjects. Describe power 
calculations if the study involves compa risons.  Perform this analysis on each of the primary and secondary objectives, if possible.  
 
Treatment  conditions  will be compared  for differences  in baseline  characteristics  using  I-tests  for continuous  measures  and chi-
square tests for categorical variables. If specific characteristics differ significantly across treatment conditions and are  
predictive  of treatment  outcomes,  they will be considered  as potential  covariates  in subsequent  analyses.  Primary  analyses  will 
include  all subjects  randomized  to treatment  conditions  independent  of early  dropout,  noncompliance,  etc., consistent  with an 
intent -to-treat approach  to randomized  clinical  trials  (Armitage,  1983).  The primary  outcome  measures  in this trial will be point 
prevalence  smoking  abstinence  at the 12- and 24-week  assessments.  We will analyze  abstinence  at [ADDRESS_1138774] 7 days,  breath  CO < 6 ppm,  confirmed  by [CONTACT_821544]  (< 50 ng/ml)  of specimens  collected  at the 
12- and 24-week  assessments  by [CONTACT_821545].  The study  is designed  to have  sufficient  power  to have  a greater 
than 80% chance  of detecting  treatment  difference  at each  assessment  point  through  24-weeks.  Abstinence  rates  at each 
assessment  will be compared  across  the treatment  conditions  using  chi square  tests  or Fisher’s  Exact  tests,  if small  expected 
cell frequencies  are present.  Comparison  of point -prevalence  abstinence  rates  among  treatment  conditions  across  all periodic 
assessments  will be analyzed  using  mixed  model  repeated  measures  for categorical  data based  on generalized  estimating 
equations  utilizing  a logistic  link function  (SAS:  PROC  GENMOD,  SAS Institute,  Cary,  NC) with assessment  time,  treatment 
condition,  and their interaction  as factors.  Treatment  comparisons  and temporal  changes  in children’s  mean  urine  cotinine  will 
be examined  using  repeated  measures  analysis  of variance  (PROC  MIXED)  across  assessments.  Group  comparisons  at each 
time point  will be based  on Fisher’s  protected  LSD.  Because  cotinine  levels  are typi[INVESTIGATOR_821520],  data will be log transformed 
prior to analyses.  Analysis  of variance  will be used  to compare  SHSe  levels  by [CONTACT_821546] -up 
assessments.  Logistic  regression  will be used  to examine  the association  between  baseline  temporal  discounting  and other 
measures  of price  sensitivity  and subsequent  abstinence.  Baseline  DD will be expressed  as the logarithm  of each  participant’s 
estimated  parameter  k, and elasticity  of demand  in the models  from the cigarette  purchase  task.  Additional  explanatory  
variables in the models will include treatment condition and subject demographic and smoking characteristics. Additional mode ls 
will examine  potential  interactions  between  treatment  condition  and measures  from the demand  curves  as well as target child 
characteristics such as baseline cotinine  level.  
 
Sample Size Justification  
Sample size was determined based on having sufficient power to detect differences between treatment conditions 
corresponding to our first specific aim on point prevalence abstinence differences at the 12 -week end -of-treatment assessment 
and the 24-week  follow -up assessment.  Our completed  trials  on smoking  cessation  among  pregnant  women  provide  relevant 
information for estimating sample size for the proposed study. Across three trials, biochemically -verified, 7 -day point - 
prevalence  abstinence  in the contingent  and non-contingent  conditions  at the end-of-pregnancy  were  -35% in the contingent 
conditions  and ranged  from 9-23% in the non-contingent  conditions.  We estimate  that the incentive  condition  will produce  35% 
abstinence rates and the usual care condition will produce 15% abstinence rates. The proposed sample size of 240 trial 
participants  (80/condition)  will result  in estimated  power  .95 using  O = 0.05 for detecting  differences  among  the treatment 
conditions  (i.e., 40% vs. 15%)  at 12-week  end-of-treatment  assessment.  Power  is estimated  to be .[ADDRESS_1138775]  a 15% (i.e., 
20% vs. 5%) difference between treatment conditions at the 24 -week follow -up assessment. For the second specific aim 
relating to the objective measure of SHSe in child ren, power is estimated to be .80 using O = 0.[ADDRESS_1138776] treatment 
differences of approximately 35% with respect to the mean decrease in urine cotinine levels from baseline and > .80 in 
comparisons  by [CONTACT_821547].  This computation  is based  on variability  estimates  from Hovell  et al. (2009)  which 
corresponds to a log transformed analysis and geometric means. This assumes moderate correlation (r = .50) between 
cotinine levels within subjects across assessment times. If our average baseline lev els are similar to theirs, this relative 
difference  translates  to an absolute  mean  difference  of approximately  4.2 ng/ml  between  treatment  conditions  and larger  effects in 
comparisons by [CONTACT_821548]. For the logistic regression analyses corresponding to the secondary aim on 
behavioral  economic  predictors,  power  is estimated  to be .80 using  O=.[ADDRESS_1138777] 
estimate  is dependent  on the total number  of predictors  and the overall  R2 of the model  with lower  detectable  OR’s  associated 
with smaller overall R2.  
 
Economic Evaluation, Cost analysis.  
We will conduct  a cost-effectiveness  analysis  (CEA)  from the societal  perspective  (Drummond  et al., 2005).  First,  to determine

2011;  http://datcap.com/),  including  incentives  projects  (Knealing  et al., 2008).  The economic  cost of treatment  will be derived by  
[CONTACT_821549]  (e.g.,  drug tests,  financial  incentives).  The total cost per treatment  epi[INVESTIGATOR_821521] - 
specific,  and will also include  the opportunity  cost of the patient’s  time while  in treatment  as measured  by [CONTACT_682709]  (Outpatient) 
version of the DATCAP (French 2005; Salomé et al., 2003). The time period of the cost analysis will span from intake to  
discontinuation  or completion  of the program.  The cost of all research -specific  resources  consumed  will be excluded  from the 
evaluation.  All costs  and benefits  will be expressed  in a common  dollar  year.  Estimated  treatment  costs  will be combined  with 
the estimated  child healthcare  utilization  costs  to represent  total costs  per treatment  condition.  Cost-effectiveness  analysis.  
CEA will be conducted  wherein  the average  (mean)  difference  in treatment  costs  across  the three  treatment  conditions  will be 
divided  by [CONTACT_565844]  (mean)  difference  in each  outcome  to derive  incremental  cost-effectiveness  ratios  (ICERs).  Statistical 
significance  of these  lCERs  will be determined  by [CONTACT_821550]-parametric  bootstrapped  standard  errors  (Drummond  et al., 
2005).  A special  form of CEA,  cost-utility  analysis  (CUA),  will be performed.  Based  upon  smoking  status  from the quit date 
through  the 48-week  assessment,  the number  of quality -adjusted  life years  (QALYs)  gained  by [CONTACT_23169] —as measured  by 
[CONTACT_821551] ‘smoking'  and/or  ‘non-smoking’  statu s will be derived  using  QALY  weights  recommended  in the 
extant literature (e.g., Cromwell et al., 1997; Flack et al., 2007). We will estimate relapse curves beyond the 48 -week 
assessment  from the literature  to estimate  longer -term outcomes.  QALYs  gained  by [CONTACT_821552]  (Taylor,  2009).  The 
incremental  cost per QALY  gained  between  the three  treatment  conditions  will be calculated  and compared  for mothers  and 
children  separately  and also summed  across  mothers  and children.  In conducting  analyses  for children,  we will assume  that all 
children residing  fulltime  with the mother share  the same  smoking  status  as the target  child.  
 
Risks/Benefits:   Describe any potential or known risks.  This includes physical, psychological, social, legal or other risks.

Subject Selection:   Provide rationale for subject selection in terms of the scientific objectives and proposed study design.  
 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_821525], almost 60% of all U.S. children and 
85% of those from low -income families are chronically exposed (Cornelius et al., 2003; Halterman et al., 2010; 
USDHHS, 2007). SHSe, especially from maternal smoking, increases risk for infant death, chronic respi[INVESTIGATOR_58776], asthma, and other longer -term medical problems. Thus, studying potential treatment approaches to reduce 
maternal smoking in disadvantaged populations is of the utmost importance.  
 
Vulnerable  Populations:   Explain the rationale for involvement of subjects  (e.g., cognitively impaired, Non-English speaking, 
prisoners , students) .  Discuss what procedures or practices will be used in the protocol to minimize their susceptibility to undue 
influences and unnecessary risk (physical, psychological, etc.).

[CONTACT_821554] a decrease in second -hand -smoke exposure.  
 
Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria:   Eligibility and ineligibility criteria should be specific. Describe how eligibility will be determined and 
by [CONTACT_20898].  Changes to the eligibility criteria at a later phase of the research have the potential to invalidate the research.

Inclusion of Minorit ies and Women:   Describe  efforts to include minorities and women.  If either minorities or women are 
excluded, include a justification for the exclusion.  
 
As we are targeting mothers for our smoking -cessation efforts, women will make up the majority of the subject pool for 
this project. All efforts will be made to include minorities in this study. As we are targeting disadvantaged women we 
are likely to recruit a more diverse group than expected given the local population.  
 
Inclusion of Chil dren:  Describe efforts to include children.  Inclusion is required unless a clear and compelling rationale shows 
that inclusion is inappropriate with respect to the health of the subjects or that inclusion is inappropriate for the purpose  of the 
study.  If  children are included, the description of the plan should include a rationale for selecting or excluding a specific age range  
of children.  When included, the plan must also describe the expertise of the investigative team in working with children, th e 
appropriateness of the available facilities to accommodate children, and the inclusion of a sufficient number of children to 
contribute to a meaningful analysis relative to the purpose of the study.  Provide target accrual for this population. Identify wheth er 
children are wards of the state. If children are excluded  then provide appropriate justification.

There will be no added expense to the participant for participation in this study.  
 
Compensation  for participation:  Describe all plans to pay subjects, either in cash, a gift or gift certificate. Please note that all 
payments must be prorated throughout the life of the study. The IRB will not approve a study where there is only a lump sum 
payment at the end of the study because this can be considered coercive. The amount of payment must be justified. Clarify if 
subjects will be reimbursed for travel or other expenses.  
 Not applicable   
 
 All subjects will receive $35 compensation for their time for each of the 5 assessments. Subjects in Treatment A 
will receive $15 in financial incentives for each of the 23 study visits. Subjects in Treatments B or C will receive 
financial incentives for the 23 study visits only if they demonstrate biochemically -verified smoking abstinence. 
Incentives for these visits start at $10 and max out at $50 (details of schedule are described above). Important to 
clarify is we consider the $35 for ea ch follow -up assessment as compensation. However, we consider financial 
incentives for attending sessions and abstaining from smoking as therapeutic interventions (i.e., therapy) and not 
compensation for study participation.

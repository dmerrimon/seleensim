1. STATEMENT OF HYPOTHESIS AND OBJECTIVES:  
 
Rosacea is a chronic inflammatory disorder that is characterized by [CONTACT_784132] (transient 
erythema), non -transient erythema, papules, pustules, and telangiectasia. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_784115]. Furthermore, rapid recurrence is common 
following the use of systemic antibiotics, resulting in the chronic us e of these medications to 
control the disease. Although the exact pathogenesis of rosacea is unknown, treatment for this 
condition has been investigated based on its similarity to acne and photodamaged skin. Case 
reports have sho wn promising results in rosacea  patients  treated with methyl aminolevulinate 
photodynamic therapy ( MAL – PDT).  Other than a case report which observed significant 
improvement of papules, pustules, erythema, and flushing following 5 - aminolevulinic acid 
photodynamic therapy ( ALA-PDT) treatment of a patient with rosacea, the role of ALA -PDT in 
the treatment of rosacea has not been reported .   
We have designed a pi[INVESTIGATOR_784116] -PDT in treating papulopustular 
rosacea. The objectives of the study are as follows:   
Primary objective:  
1. To evaluate improvement of the inflammatory lesions (papules, pustules, nodules) , 
erythema, and telangiectasia  of rosacea as assessed by [CONTACT_737]’s Global 
Assessment (IGA).  
 
2. To evaluate improvement of the inflammatory lesions (papules, pustules, nodules) of 
rosacea as assessed by [CONTACT_784133]’s Global As sessment 
(ILIGA).  
 
Secondary objective s:  
3. To evaluate improvement of rosacea associated erythema as assessed by [CONTACT_784134] (CEA) scale.  
 
4. To evaluate improvement of the inflammatory lesions (papules, pustules, nodules) of 
rosacea as measured by a difference in inflammatory lesion count.  
 
5. To evaluate improvement of rosacea as assessed by [CONTACT_784135].

Rosacea

Version Date: March 14, 2017  
  
Rosacea is a chronic inflamma tory disorder that is characterized by [CONTACT_784132]  (transient 
erythema) , non transient  erythema, papules, pustule s, and telangiectasia. It primarily affects the 
central third of t he face . Secondary features of rosacea include burning or stinging, 
erythematous plaques, edema, dry appearance, peripheral locations, ocular manifestations, and 
phymatous changes.1 It has a prevalence of about 10%. The majority of patients with rosacea 
are between the ages of 30 -60 years of age.2,3   
There are four subtypes of rosacea ( erythematotela ngiectatic, papulopustular, phymatous, and 
ocular ); patients may have characteristics of more than one subtype. Although the  exact 
pathogen esis of rosacea is unknown, increased blood flow, excess ive sun exposure, hair follicle 
mites ( Demodex folliculorum and Demodex brevis ), and inflammatory mediators (neutrophils, 
macrophages, and lymphocytes)  are thought to play role.3  
Treatmen t for rosacea consists  of topi[INVESTIGATOR_112935], sodium s ulfacetamide, sulfur, topi[INVESTIGATOR_784117], antibiotics (e rythromycin, clindamycin, tetracycline), and, in resistant 
cases, isotretinoin. The therapeutic effect of these medications on rosacea is related more 
towards their anti -inflammatory than their antibacterial actions.3, 4  
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] t herapy is not always effe ctive in treating symptoms of rosacea. Furthermore, rapid 
recurrence is common following th e use of systemic antibiotics , resulting in the chronic use of 
these medications in order to control the disease .4  Pharmacological treatment  is partially 
effective  in treating the papulopustular lesions of rosacea, but the t reatment of erythema, 
flushing,  and telangiectasia is limited and at times requires the use of  lasers, including pulse -
dye laser.5   
Photodynamic Therapy  
Photodynamic therapy (PDT)  has been used for various dermatological conditions . It involves 
the administrati on of a photosensitizer  which is absorbed  by [CONTACT_784136] . Absorption occurs 
preferentially by  [CONTACT_784137]. Illumination with a light 
source of a spe cific wavelength results in the release of reactive oxygen specie s within the 
target tissue and results in the phototoxic destruction of tissue and bacteria.4,6   
5 - amino levulinic acid (ALA) and its methylated ester , methyl  aminolevulinate (MAL) , are two 
commo n photosensitizers used in PDT. Both ALA and MAL are converted to protoporphyrin IX 
(PpIX), a cytotoxic intermediate that des troys tissues through necrosis and apoptosis . ALA, 
which is activated by [CONTACT_491895] (417 +/ - 5nm) , is approved by [CONTACT_784138] (AKs)  of the face and scalp. It has also been used off -label  in 
treating acne vulgaris, photodamaged  skin, sebaceous hyperplasia, and skin cancer. MAL, 
which is activated by [CONTACT_784139], is approved by [CONTACT_784140] s calp. MAL is also approved in some European countries for the treatment 
of superficial and nodular basal cell carcinoma (BCC)  and Bowen’s disease.4,6

 Both ALA and MAL – PDT have been effecti ve in treating acne vulgaris. Studies have shown 
that PDT results in significant reductions in the number of inflammatory acne lesions.[ADDRESS_1078341] been screened within the Department of Dermatology 
at the Medical Faculty Associates. Individuals meeting inclusion and exclusion  criteria (see 
Section 3.2 ) will be randomized to one of three groups (groups A, B, or C) ; each group will 
contain [ADDRESS_1078342] their entire face treated with 20% 5 -ALA 
(Levulan® Kerastick®, Dusa Pharmaceuticals)  and Blu-U light (D[LOCATION_003] ®) . Those in group B will

®). Those in group C will have their entire face  treated with the vehicle  (Kerastick® without 5 -
ALA) only.  All patients will have their face treated with either 20% 5 -ALA (Levulan® Kerastick®, 
Dusa  Pharmaceuticals)  or the vehicle  (Kerastick® without 5 -ALA), which will remain in cont act 
with the skin for one hour and, for those in group A and B,  subsequently irradiated with a 417nm 
blue light set at 10 J/cm2 from a Blu -U light (D[LOCATION_003] ®)  for [ADDRESS_1078344] will receive a total of 4 treatments with a 2 -3 week interval between each treatment  (See 
Section 3.4) . In addition, the face will be photographed and assessed by a blinded investigator 
(See Section 4 ). If ≥ 30% of patients in group A experience improvement in the Investigator’s 
Global Assessment Score (IGA) by [CONTACT_784141] (See Section 3)  we will  offer subjects in 
group B and group C one treatment  with 20% 5 -ALA (Levulan® Kerastick®, Dusa 
Pharmaceutica ls) and Blu -U light (D[LOCATION_003] ®) , which will occur 2 -3 weeks after the completion of 
the blinded study period .

3.4 Treatment Phase  
After the screening phase , subjects (ages 18 – 79 yea rs) with papulopustular rosacea, will be 
randomized  into one of three groups (groups A, B, or C).  Each group will contain [ADDRESS_1078348] their entire face treated with 20% 5 -ALA (Levulan® Kerastick®, 
Dusa Pharmaceuticals) and Blu -U light (D[LOCATION_003] ®). Those in group B will have their entire face 
treated with the vehicle (Kerastick® without 5 -ALA) and Blu -U light (D[LOCATION_003] ®). Those in group  C 
will have their entire face treated with the vehicle (Kerastick® without 5 -ALA) only. All subjects 
will have th eir face cl eansed with acetone; each subjects face should be clean and dry prior to 
application of 20% 5 -ALA (Levulan® Kerastick®, Dusa Pharmaceuticals)  or vehicle ( Kerastick® 
without 5 -ALA).  20% 5 -ALA (Levulan® Kerastick®, Dusa Pharmaceuticals)  or vehicle 
(Kerastick® without 5 -ALA) will be crushed and prepared for application after shaking for at 
least 3 minutes.  Topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] 5 -ALA or vehicle  will be liberally applied on skin ( entire face) with extra 
pressure on lesions and allowed to remain in contact [CONTACT_61708] [ADDRESS_1078349] their entire face  irradiated with a 417nm blue light set at 10 J/cm2 from a

Version Date: March 14, 2017  
 group A experience improvement in the Investigator’s Global Assessment Score (IGA) by [CONTACT_784142] (See Section 3) we will offer subjects in group B and group C an additional full 
face treatment with 20% 5 -ALA (Levulan® Kerastick®, Dusa Pharmaceuticals) and Blu -U light 
(D[LOCATION_003] ®)  2-3 weeks after the completion of the blinded study period.  Assessments 
(Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA), Inflammatory Lesion Investigator’s Global Assessment 
(ILIGA), Clinical Erythema Asse ssment (CEA) Scale, inflammatory lesion count, and 
photographs (See Section 4.1.3))  will be performed at baseline, p rior to ea ch treatment session, 
and at study completion  by a blinded investigator.  A Patient Overall Assessment will be 
performed prior to e very treatment visit ( except week 0), and at study completion.  
3.5 Study Completion and Withdrawal Criteria  
Completion of the blinded component of the study will occur for each individual after 4 
treatments with 20% 5 -ALA (Levulan® Kerastick®, Dusa Pharmaceuticals) and Blu -U light 
(D[LOCATION_003] ®)  (group A), vehicle (Kerastick® without 5 -ALA) and Blu -U light (D[LOCATION_003] ®)  (group B), or 
vehicle (Kerastick® without 5 -ALA) only (group C) . Participants will have final assessments 
performed 2 months (+/ - 2 weeks)  after their last treatment  of the blinded period , as outlined in 
Table 1. If ≥30% of patients in group A experience improvement in the Investigator’s Global 
Assessment Score (IGA) by [CONTACT_784141] (See Section 3) we will offer subjects in group B 
and group C an additional full face treatment  with 20% 5 -ALA (Levulan® Kerastick®, Dusa 
Pharmaceuticals) and Blu -U light (D[LOCATION_003] ®) , which will occur [ADDRESS_1078351] in accordance 
with IRB policies and procedures.  
3.6 Strength and Limitations of Proposed Research  
Strengths of the study include its relatively simple design and the potential for its completion 
within a short period of time due to the smal l number of participants (ten).   
Limitations of this study include the inability to conduct robust statistical analysis due to its small 
sample size.  However, the res ults of this project may lead to the development of larger studies 
that will have the statistical power to detect improvements.  
4. DATA VARIABLES, COLLECTION, AND EVALUATION  
4.1 Data Variables  
The following data will be evaluated in patients fulfilling in clusion and exclusion criteria and who 
agree to participate in the study.   
1. Sociodemographic Variables : Age, gender, race

Version Date: March 14, 2017  
  
2.   Clinical History : 
a. Rosacea history : The patient's disease and treatment history will be obtained. All past 
and current medications for rosacea will be recorded.  
b. Past medical history : All current and past medical conditions will be documented, 
allowing us to screen for the presence of any condition that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_118850], would make the patient uns uitable for study inclusion.  Allergies to 
medications will also be noted.  
c. Current medications : All medications will be recorded.    
d. Social History : We will screen for the presence of any drug or alcohol abuse within 
the past [ADDRESS_1078352] or patient interview.  
 
3.   Rosacea  - specific Variables : All variables described below will be assessed by [CONTACT_784143].  
      a.   Investigator’s global assessment of rosacea (IGA). The IGA  is a subjective 7-     
       point , static scoring system. Scores range from 0 to 6: 0 (clear) = no papules and/or            
       pustules, no residual erythema, no or mild to moderate telang iectasia; 1(minimal) =    
       rare papules and/or pustules, residual to mild erythema, mild to moderate              
       telangiectasia; 2 (mild) few papules and/or pustules, mild erythema, mild to moderate   
       telangiectasia; 3 (mild to moderat e) = distinct number of papules and or/pustules;         
       mild to moderate erythema; mild to moderate telangiectasia; 4 (moderate) =          
       pronounced number of papules and/ or pustules, moderate erythema, mild to         
       moderate tel angiectasia; 5 (moderate to severe) = many papules and/ or pustules,     
       occasionally with large inflamed lesions, moderate erythema, moderate          
       telangiectasia ; 6 (severe) = numerous papules and/or pustules occasionally with     
       confluent areas o f inflamed lesions; moderate or severe erythema, moderate or      
       severe telangiectasia.  This assessment will be performed at baseline, prior to                 
       every treatm ent visit, and study completion . Improvement will be indicated by          
a decrease in the IGA score by ≥ 1 point  compared to the previous assessment.              
Worsening will be indicated by [CONTACT_784144] ≥ 1 point compared to         
the previous assessment.  
 
  b.   Inflammatory Lesion  Investigator’s Global Assessment ( ILIGA) . The I LIGA is a  
       subjective 5-point measure of the overall disease severity. Scores range from 0 to 4:      
                  0 (clear) = no papules/pustules/nodules ; 1 (almost clear) = 1 to 2 papules/pustules; 2     
                  (mild) = 3 to 10 papules/pustules; 3 (moderate) = 11 to 19 papules/pustules or ≤ 2   
                  nodules; 4  (severe) = ≥ 20 papules/pustules, or >  2 nodules. This assessment will be 
       performed at baseline, prior to every treatment visit,  and study completion .          
       Improvement will be indicated by a decrease in the ILIGA score by ≥ 1 point   
       compared to the previous assessment. Worsening will be indicated by [CONTACT_784145] ≥ 1 point compared to the previous assessment.

Version Date: March 14, 2017  
             c.   Clinical  Erythema Assessment (CEA) scale . The CEA scale is an assessment of                                
         erythema. It has a score range from 0 to 4: 0 (none) = no redness; 1 (mild) = slight     
        pi[INVESTIGATOR_96225]; 2 (moderate) = definite redness; 3 (significant) = marked erythema; 4       
        (severe)  = fiery redness. Th e total score is based on the evaluation of all areas of       
        the face (forehead, chin, right cheek, left cheek, and nose). Each of these areas will   
        be scored from 0 -4, giving a maximum total score of 20.  Improvement will be      
                   indicated by a decrease in the total CEA score by ≥ 1 point compared to the          
                   previous assessment. Worsening will be indicated by [CONTACT_784146] ≥ 1 point compared to the previous as sessment.  The CEA will be   
                   performed  at baseline, prior to every treatment visit, and  study completion.  
 
  d   Inflammatory lesion count.  The number of inflammatory lesions (papules, pustules,   
       nodules) will be recorded at baseline, prior to every treatment visit, and                  
                  at study completion . The inflammatory lesion count will be used to grade the     
                  ILIGA (See 4.1.3.a above).  
    
 
e.   Photographs: Photographs of the face will be taken at baseline, prior to every   
treatment visit, and at study completion. These  photographs will be used by [CONTACT_784147], CEA  scale, and in determining the  number of 
inflammatory lesion s present.  
 
f.   Patient Overall  Assessment  Scale . Patients  will assess the  overall improvement of                
      their rosacea using a 4-point scale, where 1 =  excellent improvement , 2 = good /    
      moderate improvement, 3 = no change,  4 = worsening. This assessment will be     
      performed prior to every treatment visit  (except week 0) , and at study    
                  completion . Improvement will be indicated by a decrease by ≥ 1 point compared to        
the previous asse ssment. Worsening will be  indicated by [CONTACT_784148] ≥ [ADDRESS_1078353] of the data will initially be recorded on approved study forms containing the participant's 
study ID code. After transfer of data into the computerized database, all paper forms will be kept 
in a secure locked cabinet within a locked office within the department.  Pho tographs will be stored 
with a secure electronic file and will be labeled with the participant's study ID code and date they 
were taken .

Individuals from all racial/ethnic groups, regardless of gender, and those that are economically 
and educationally disadvantaged are eligible for this study if they meet the eligibility 
requirements.  
 
5.2 Risks and Benefits  
 
A temporary burning or stinging sensati on may occur during lig ht exposure following ALA 
application . A minority of patients may experience these symptoms after light exposure.  Pruritus  
may also occur.6   
 
Patients with AKs and BCC usually experience a phototoxic reaction (edema, erythema, vesicles, 
crusting, erosion s) when treated with ALA -PDT. This is an expected reaction that eve ntually 
results in the resolution  of the treated lesions . These phototoxic reactions can  be associated with 
pain, burn ing, and peeling and can last for up to [ADDRESS_1078356] 48 hrs following PDT treatment and to also  wear a wide -
brimmed hat  or other protective apparel to shade the treated area from sun light or other bright 
light.

 healthy skin following ALA -PDT is dependent on th e dose of ALA. It  usually occurs within 48 -72 
hours following  treatment and increases for the following two weeks . It occur s more frequently in 
individuals with psoriasis who are treated with PDT. In on e study, all twenty -one subjects  with 
psoriasis experienced mild to moderate hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_784122] p soriasis les ions following 
PDT. In another study,  PDT resulted in hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_784123] . Pi[INVESTIGATOR_784124].  The Scottish PDT Centre reported that 1% of 762 patients treated with 
PDT for non melanoma skin cancer developed pi[INVESTIGATOR_9491]. Prolonged 
hyperpig mentation has been observed  when treating hirsutism  with PDT .6,14

20 patients with moderate to severe acne vulgaris of the face had one side of their face treated 
with ALA -PDT and the other side treated with blue light alone. Patients experience d erythema, 
pain, stinging, peeling, pruritis, oozing, and pustules  on their face . Fifty-five percent of patients 
experienced stinging  and 25% experienced pain during  ALA-PDT treatment. ALA -PDT resulted 
in erythema in 65% of patients,  exfoliation in  70%, pruritus in 65%;  these symptoms were more 
severe on acne lesions. These symptoms resolved within a few days following treatment and 
were less severe on the side of the face  treated with blue light alone. Two patients experienced 
edema, crusting, and oozing and another two patients experienced transient pustular lesions on 
the side of the face treated with ALA-PDT treatment. Hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_784126] -

been observed wh en treating BCC  and Bowen’s disease.  
 
Scarring following topi[INVESTIGATOR_784127].  Of the 762 patients treated with PDT for non melanoma 
skin cancer  at the Scottish PDT Centre (See Above), only  0.8% developed mild to moderate 
scarring.6,[ADDRESS_1078358]

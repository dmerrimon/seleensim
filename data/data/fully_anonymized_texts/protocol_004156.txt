 CHAPTER 1: INTRO DUCTION  58 
 59 
The study is being conducted by [CONTACT_941] T1D Exchange Clinic Network and is being coordinated by 60 
the Jaeb Center for Health Research in Tampa, [LOCATION_012].   61 
 62 
1.1 Study Background and  Rationale  63 
Exercise is at the cornerstone of type 1 diabetes (T1D) management (1). However, blood glucose 64 
stability during exercise, and for up to 12 -24 hours in recovery, remains a major challenge (2). A 65 
fear of hypoglycemia deters many patients from enga ging in aerobic exercise (3). For those who 66 
choose to exercise on a regular basis, hypoglycemia is a common complaint that often requires  67 
breaks in sports and competition, games and training (1). To reduce the incidence of 68 
hypoglycemia during and immediate ly after exercise, patients are recommended to reduce their 69 
bolus dose at the meal preceding exercise by 25 -75% (1), however, this approach frequently 70 
results in pre -exercise hyperglycemia, particularly if the exercise is performed 2 hou rs or more 71 
after th e meal (2,4, 5).  Even exercise in the fasting state in patients on continuous subcutaneous 72 
insulin infusion (CSII) promotes a drop in glycemia if basal insulin levels are unadjusted (6).  [ADDRESS_169235]-exercise nocturnal hypoglycemia is also very common in T1D, wit h roughly 50% of young 75 
patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_147685] 7 -11 hours after the end of vigorous afternoon exercise 76 
(7). If insulin administration occurs to correct post -exercise meal -related hyperglycemia (often 77 
called rebound hyperglycemia), severe po st-exercise hypoglycemia can occur which may even 78 
result in death (8). Patients can reduce the dose of rapid -acting insulin administered with the 79 
dinner meal after late day exercise to reduce nocturnal hypoglycemia risk (9) or lower basal 80 
insulin delivery for 6 hours at bedtime (10) to help mitigate risk, but these strategies often result 81 
in hyperglycemia (9, 10). Although extra carbohydrate ingestion not covered by [CONTACT_134755] 82 
administration can help prevent hypoglycemia during and after exercise (11), excessi ve intake [ADDRESS_169236] hypoglycemia. The International 88 
Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes guidelines recommend that basal insulin 89 
reductions should be done 60 -90 minutes before the start of exercise so that circul ating insulin 90 
levels are lowered by [CONTACT_147690] (12). This is a somewhat cumbersome and [ADDRESS_169237] educated and 92 
motivated patients. Since glucose production by [CONTACT_147691] 93 
primarily facilitated by a rise in the glucagon to insulin ratio (13) and patients with T1D have a 94 
reduction in this ratio during exercise because of a relative peripheral hyperinsulinemia (13) and 95 
impaired glucagon secretio n (14), it may be better to attempt to change this ratio by [CONTACT_941] 96 
administration of glucagon at the onset of exercise. The recent development of a more stable 97 
form of soluble glucagon (e.g. G-Pen MiniTM glucagon from Xeris Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  98 
(Xeris) ) has  given researchers and clinicians the possibility of using this product as a [ADDRESS_169238] crossover trial. 116 
 117

See section 2.2 for a complete listing of inclusion and exclusion criteria . 127 
 128 
1.2.4 Visit Schedule  129 
1. Screening /Baseline V isit  130 
o Sign informed consent form and assess ment of  eligibility  131 
o Assessment of VO 2max for fitness evaluation and for the determination of 132 
exercise intensity for the experimental trials .  133 
 134 
2. Randomized Crossover Trial  135 
Each participant  will undergo four aerobic exercise sessions (in random order) in the 136 
CRC, with different strategies for glucose regulation:  137 
 Control Trial : Fasted exercise, no basal insulin reduction  138 
 Strategy 1: Fasted  exercise, basal insulin reduction only (50% reduction in basal rate 139 
five minutes before exercise , for the duration of the exercise)  140 
 Strategy 2 : Fasted exercise , no basal adjustment  + pre -exercise glucose tabs (buccal 141 
route -40 grams in total )  142 
 Strategy 3: Fasted  exercise, no basal adjustment + pre -exercise mini -dose glucagon  143 
(sc)  144 
 145 
In all 4 sessions , aerobic exercise will be performed in the fasted state (before a 146 
standardized meal) for 45 minutes at ~50 -55% of the  participant’s  pre-determined aerobic 147 
 
mini-dose glucagon exercise protocol v3.0_04 -14-16 clean       Page 6 of 25 
 capacity (see flow chart in section 1.4).  The strategies for select sessions will b e blinded as 148 
described in section 3.2.2.  149 
 150 
1.2.5 Primary Outcome  151 
The primary outcome for this study will be the glycemic response  during exercise and 152 
early recovery . 153 
 154 
1.2.6 Main Safety Outcomes  155 
 Hypoglycemic events  156 
 Hyperglycemic events  157 
 Dizziness, pallor and other symptoms of poor perfusion and /or exercise [ADDRESS_169239] their origin in the Declaration of H elsinki, with 163 
the protocol described herein, and with the standards of Good Clinical Practice.  164 
 165 
A risk -based monitoring approach will be followed, consistent with the FDA “Guidance for 166 
Industry Oversight of Clinical Investigations — A Risk -Based Approach t o Monitoring” (August 167 
2013).  168 
 169 
The mini-dose glucagon  preparation (G-Pen Mini™ ) is not FDA approved.  Therefore, an IND 170 
(#119733 ) has been received from the FDA by [CONTACT_147692].  The Daily 171 
Dose ™ syringes used to inject the mini -dose gl ucagon are also not FDA approved in the U.S.  172 
While use of the syringes will be considered investigational, the study investigators believe they 173 
do not meet significant risk device criteria per 21 CFR 812.3(m) and thus an IDE from the FDA 174 
is not needed.  175

 CHAPTER 3: STUDY PRO TOCOL  [ADDRESS_169247] Exercise Session  296 
 Assessment of VO 2max following the Bruce protocol   297 
 Optimization of basal insulin dose as per investigator’s usual routine  [ADDRESS_169248] 3 days  and participants will be expe cted to complete all sessions 303 
within 12 weeks from the time of the baseline/screening visit .  Participants will be advised to 304 
avoid any vigorous exercise within 24 hours before or after the laboratory -based exercise tests. 305 
Subjects will be asked about acti vity to monitor adherence to these recommendations.  306 
 307 
3.2.1 Prior to Exercise Sessions  308 
The day before each exercise session participants will:  309 
 Insert new insulin infusion set into abdomen  or upper buttock  (ensure not in exercising 310 
limb).  311 
 For CGM users,  insert a new CGM  sensor  312 
 For non -CGM  users, come into clinic to have a CGM sensor inserted to use with a 313 
blinded receiver  314 
 315 
The participant will be contact[CONTACT_147695] 316 
each exercise session  to review gluc ose levels and help mitigate pre -exercise hyperglycemia or 317 
hypoglycemia .  318 
 If at the time of the morning call, the glucose concentration is below target ( <100 319 
mg/d L), then supplemental fast -acting carbohydrate will be taken . If above target ( >140 320 
mg/d L), then a conservative correction bolus will be recommended (based on insulin 321 
sensitivity factor).   322 
 323 
The participant will arrive at the CRC in a fasted state (minimum of [ADDRESS_169249]) by 9 a.m., but 324 
exercise sessions can begin as early as  8 a.m.   325 
 Blood glucose  concentration will be check ed upon arrival to the clinic . Oral glucose or 326 
IV glucose may be given to bring participant into range before exercise.  327 
 Females will have a urine pregnancy test performed prior to each exercise session (if 328 
applicable) . 329 
 330 
 Before an exercise session can begin:  [ADDRESS_169250] be: 100 - 140 mg/dL (venous, plasma)  [ADDRESS_169251] insulin bolus (mealtime or correction) should be ≥3 hours previously  333 
  334 
3.2.2 During Exercise Sessions  335 
At each visit, participants will complete one of the fo llowing four exercise sessions (sequence of 336 
sessions determined by [CONTACT_17628]):  337 
 338 
 
mini-dose glucagon exercise protocol v3.0_04 -14-16 clean       Page 12 of 25 
 Control Trial :  No basal insulin adjustment, no carbohydrate intake until glucose drops <70 339 
mg/dL.  Then 20 grams of dextrose will be given orally.  340 
Strategy 1 :  Basal insul in reduction to 50% five minutes  before the start of exercise. Basal 341 
insulin rate will be returned to usual rate 45 minutes after the start of exercise.   342 
Strategy 2 : Dextrose tabs taken orally (20 grams) five minutes before the start of exercise and 343 
at 30 minutes of exercise (total 40 grams) . 344 
Strategy 3 *:  Glucagon (150 µg) five minutes before the start of exercise (SQ -abdomen) . 345 
 346 
*The dose for strategy [ADDRESS_169252] appropriate dose.  349 
 350 
The participant’s pump will be blinded during the control trial, strategy 1, and strategy [ADDRESS_169253] of moderate intensity aerobic activity (treadmill jogg ing/brisk walking) 355 
performed at 50 -55% of predetermined VO 2max for 45 minutes . Continuous  heart rate  356 
measurements will be conducted along with intermittent ratings of perceived exertion (Borg 6 -20 357 
scale) . 358 
 359 
Exercise will be terminated if:  360 
 Glucose is <70 mg/dL; participants will be treated for hypoglycemia  (initially 20 grams 361 
of oral dextrose tabs or IV dextrose or IM glucagon depending on the  severity of the 362 
hypoglycemia ). 363 
 Participants experience dizziness, pallor and other symptoms of poor perfusion and or [ADDRESS_169254] for 30 minutes and then consume a 373 
standardized meal  containing  44-50 grams of carbohydrate that constitute ~55% of calories, 374 
together with ~20% calories from protein and ~25% calories from fat. The amount of bolus 375 
insulin given will be based on the carbohydrate content of the meal and the patient’s own [ADDRESS_169255] phase of the experiments, insulin “corrections” will not be given [ADDRESS_169256] exercise/ pre meal hyperglycemia ≥270 mg/dl. If hypoglycemia occurs [ADDRESS_169257] 2 hours after the meal prior to discharge.  383 
 384 
 
mini-dose glucagon exercise protocol v3.0_04 -14-16 clean       Page 13 of 25 
 Participants will be given a meal log and another standardized meal to take with them at 385 
discharge. Participants will be instructed to eat the standardized meal for their next meal and log 386 
the time it was eaten. They will also be asked to log any meals they consume through noon the 387 
following day.  388 
 389 
For participants using the blinded CGM, the sensor will be removed at 12PM the next day a t 390 
home (~ 24 hours after the end of exercise).  The participant will bring the device to the next [ADDRESS_169258] exercise session.  398 
 399

 CHAPTER 4: ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING AND SAFETY MONITORING  [ADDRESS_169261] medical occurrence in a study participant, irrespective 429 
of whether or not the event is considered treatment -related, that occurs 12 hours prior, during, or the 430 
day after each exercise session , except for hypoglyce mia, hyperglycemia, injection -related, and 431 
exercise -induced events which are only reported as adverse events when the criteria described 432 
below are met.  433 
 434

glucagon to treat.   436 
 437 
Hyperglycemic events  are recorded as Adverse Events if evaluation or treatment was obtained from 438 
a health care provider  or if the event involved DKA, as defined by [CONTACT_147697] 439 
Complications Trial ( DCCT ) and described below , or in the absence of DKA if evaluation or 440 
treatment was obtained from a health care provider or an acute event involving hyperglycemia or 441 
ketosis.  442 
 443 
Hyperglycemic events are classified as DKA if all of the following are present:   444 
 Symptoms such as polyuria, polydipsia , nausea, or vomiting  445 
 Serum ketones >1.5 mmol/L or large/moderate urine ketones  446 
 Either arterial blood pH <7.30 or venous pH <7.24 or serum bicarbonate <15  447 
 Treatment provided in a health care facility  [ADDRESS_169262] falls during the exercise 453 
protocol or develops signs or symptoms of a myocardial infarction, poor perfusion (pallor, 454 
cyanosis), angi na, pathologic  arrhythmia,  or another medical condition not expected to occur during [ADDRESS_169263] been 467 
caused by [CONTACT_8235].  Reasonable possibility is not the same as “any possibility.”   The 468 
following should be considered when evaluating the relationship:  469 
• Timing of event  470 
• Patient’s history  471 
 
 
mini-dose glucagon exercise protocol v3.0_04 -14-16 clean       Page 15 of 25 
 • Prevalence of finding in population at risk  472 
• Other possible causes - diseases, exposures, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], etc  473 
• Known pharmacology of study drug (and control) or side effect of drug  474 
 475 
The intensity of adverse events will be rated on a three -point scale: (1) mild, (2) moderate, or (3) 476 
severe.  It is emphasized that the term severe is a measure of intensity: thus, a severe a dverse event 477 
is not necessarily serious. For example, itching for several days may be rated as severe, but may not 478 
be clinically serious.  479 
Adverse events that continue after the study participant’s discontinuation or completion of the study [ADDRESS_169264] occurrence that:  487 
 Results in death  488 
 Is life -threatening (a non -life-threatening event which, had it been more severe, might have 489 
become life -threatening, is not necessarily considered a serious adverse event)  490 
 Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  491 
 Results in significant disability/incapacity  492 
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  493 
 Could have  result ed in death, be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_147687] [ADDRESS_169265] be reported to the Coordinating Center immediately via 497 
completion of the online se rious adverse event form.   498

unexpected  adverse events and abiding by [CONTACT_66716]/her  IRB.  516 
 517 
4.2 Risks  518 
4.2.1 Potential Risks and Side Effects  519 
Glucagon has a long  history of medical use in the U .S., and is currently marketed by [CONTACT_13440] & Co. 520 
as Glucagon for Injection [rDNA origin], and Novo Nordisk as GlucaGen® HypoKit®, both [ADDRESS_169267] been well 523 
established.  524 
 525 
In a Phase 2 study, Protocol No. XSGP -201, healthy, fasted adult volunteers were administered 526 
rescue doses of Xeris  G-Pen™ (glucagon injection) (0.5 mg and 1.0 mg) and Lilly Glucagon for 527 
Injection [rDNA origin] (1.0 mg) in a randomized, crossover fashion.  Overall, all Xeris and Lilly [ADDRESS_169268] commonly reported 530 
AE was injection site pain, and the incidence of this AE was significantly higher in the Xeris 0.5 mg 531 
and Xeris 1 mg groups compared with the Lilly 1 mg group; however, edema and erythema at the [ADDRESS_169269] commonly reported AE was nausea, the incidence of which was significantly 534 
higher compa red with the Xeris 0.5 mg and 1 mg groups.  The incidences of all remaining AEs 535 
were low and not notably different across treatment groups.  536 
 537 
However , as reported by [CONTACT_147698]  (15), when subcutaneous glucagon in dosages of 20 –150 μg  was 538 
given to children to manage impending hypoglycemia due to gastroenteritis or poor oral intake of 539 
carbohydrates, it did not result in a perceived worsening of the patient’s nausea, nor did it result in 540 
emesis immediately after glucagon administration, as is commonly observed with the recommended 541 
single large 500 –1,000 μg rescue dose.   542 
 543 
In Xeris’ completed Phase 2a safety/PK/PD study , Protocol No. XSMP -201, which tested 75 –300 544 
μg G -Pen Mini™ doses in adult T1D patients, neither nausea nor vomiting were observed with 545 
doses of 75 -150 μg. Nausea, but not vomiting was reported by 4/12 subjects given the 300  μg dose 546 
(3 mild, 1 moderate).  Since doses of subcutaneous G -Pen Mini™ (glucagon injection) given to 547 
adults per this protocol  will range from 75 –[ADDRESS_169270] proliferative retinopathy, exercise that 556 
increas es blood pressure significantly (>180 mmHg) can promote retinal bleeding ( PMID:  557 
21800941 ). Since all participants will be screened prior to the exercise test for diabetes -related [ADDRESS_169271] blood volumes collected may vary according to 563 
local IRB regulations.  The maximum blood volume collected from adults >18 years will not exceed 564 
250 ml at each visit.  565

 637 
6.2 Analysis Plan  638 
  639 
6.2.1 Primary Outcome  640 
The primar y outcome for this study will be glucose , as measured by [CONTACT_147701] , during exercise 641 
and early recovery .  642 
 643 
6.2.2 Primary Analysis  644 
The primar y analysis  for this study will be a descriptive comparison of glycemic response  during 645 
exercise and early recovery  between the mini -dose glucagon group (strategy 3) and the control 646 
group. Summary statistics will be calculated.  In the event that exercise is terminated early due to 647 
glucose <70 mg/dL and the participant  is treated for hypoglycemia, the nadir glucose value will be [ADDRESS_169278] of significance, a  treatment comparison of glucose during exercise and early 651 
recovery  will be completed using a linear mixed model with repeated measures that accounts for the 652 
correlation due to the cross -over design and the correlation due to multiple measures, adjusting for 653 
baseline  glucose level and period.  Regression diagnostics will be performed and if the distribution 654 
of residuals is skewed, non -parametric methods and transformations will be considered.  655 
 656 
6.2.3 Secondary Outcomes   657 
The following outcome measures will also be analyzed.  658 
 Occurrence of hypoglycemia (<70 mg/dL) as measured  by [CONTACT_147702] 659 
early recover y 660 
 
 
mini-dose glucagon exercise protocol v3.0_04 -14-16 clean       Page 21 of 25 
  Occurrence of hyperglycemia (≥ 270 mg/dL) as measured by [CONTACT_147703] 661 
time periods: during exercise, after exercise  in early recover y/prior to meal ingestion  and for 662 
90 minutes after the meal (2 hours after the end of exercise)  663 
 Glucose  levels during exercise and early recovery (venous plasma)  664 
 Glucose levels after a standardized meal (glucose area under the curve analysis, venous 665 
plasma)  666 
 Glucose levels in late recovery ( afternoon and overnight following the exercise protocols - 667 
CGM  analysis ) 668 
o Mean  669 
o Nadir  670 
o Area ab ove and below curve threshold (i.e. area above or below 70-180 mg/dL ) 671 
o % of time in range (70 -180 mg/dL)  672 
o % of time below 70 mg/dL  673 
o Occurrence of hypoglycemia (<70 mg/dL)  overnight  674 
 Carbohydrate intake (before, during and for [ADDRESS_169279] exercise)  675 
 HR and ratings of perceived exertion  676 
 Insulin and glucose counterregulatory hormones (glucagon, GH, catecholamines, cortisol)  677 
 Inflammatory cytokines (TNFα, IL -6) 678 
 Metabolites (nonesterified fa tty acids, β -hydroxybuterate , lactate ) 679 
 680 
 681 
6.2.4 Secondary Analyses   682 
The primary and secondary outcomes  will largely be examine d in a descriptive manner.  Summary 683 
statistics will be calculated by [CONTACT_100287] . For binary variables, p ercentage of participants 684 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_147689], with 95% confidence interval, will be calculated  by [CONTACT_147704]. Each of the 685 
three strategies will be compared to the control in secondary analyses.  686 
 687 
Tests of significance will also be obtained using a 2 -sided alpha of 0. 05. For binary variables, a  688 
generalized linear mixed model with a logistic link function for a binary outcome will be fit to 689 
assess differences between strategy 3 and each of the other strategies .  The model will be adjusted 690 
for baseline glucose and period . For continuous variables, repeated measures linear regression 691 
models will be fit adjusting for period and where applicable the baseline value. Regression 692 
diagnostics will be performed and if the distribution of residuals is skewed, non -parametric methods  693 
and transformations will be considered.   No formal correction will be made for multiple 694 
comparisons.  695 
 696 
6.3 Safety Analyses  697 
Adverse events will be tabulated by [CONTACT_147704] :    698 
 Proportion reporting at least one adverse event  699 
 Proportion with an adverse event thought by [CONTACT_147705]  700 
 Proportion who stopped study treatment  in response to an adverse event  701 
 Total number of adverse events reported  702 
 Number of serious adverse events reported  703 
 Number of non -seriou s adverse events reported  704

Protocol History
Version Number Type Version Date
1.0 Original Protocol 24 Jul 2018
1.1-BEL Local Protocol Amendment 06 Nov 2018
2.0 Global Protocol Amendment 30 Nov 2018
This amendment is substantial based on the criteria in Article 10(a) of Directive 2001/20/EC of 
the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union.
Overall Rationale for the Amendment
In general, this global amendment incorporates clarifications and changes to allow investigative 
sites additional ease in enrolling and adhering to the protocol.
Section # and 
NameDescription of Change Brief Rationale
Title Page “Phase 1b Safety Run-in” was added to the 
study titleThe title now reflects the Part A, Phase 1b 
Safety Run-in portion of the trial which was 
previously not included.
Throughout, 
where applicableThe order of study drugs was modified
where applicable to carboplatin + M6620 + 
avelumab therapy. Avelumab maintenance 
therapy compared to the standard of care (SoC) now includes optional bevacizumab (that is platinum-containing chemotherapy with optional bevacizumab).To establish consistent study intervention 
naming conventions throughout the document, where applicable.
Synopsis and 
Section 3: 
Objectives and Endpoints 
(Parts A and B)Deleted irRECIST for response assessment. Assessment by [CONTACT_28474]-[ADDRESS_1164713] v1.1.
Synopsis and Section 3:
Objectives and 
Endpoints 
(Part A only)Deleted secondary objective to characterize 
immunogenicity.Part A is expected to have as few as 
3 participants and up to 18 participants; given 
the low rate of immunogenicity observed in other avelumab trials, it is unlikely to reliably characterize immunogenicity from only Part A 
participants. The Part B objective to 
characterize immunogenicity will include all participants treated with avelumab from both
Parts A or B. 
Tables 1, 2, 
and 3: 
Schedule of AssessmentsAdded clarifying language for evaluating 
progression as per GCIG guidelines.To provide clarification of guidelines for 
response/progression.
Synopsis Study 
Intervention 
Groups and 
Section 6Clarification that after a completion of 
6 cycles, participants will continue in 
maintenance treatment with avelumab (800 mg every 2 weeks as monotherapy) until PD, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of 
consent, death, or a minimum of 12 months 
of treatment following confirmed CR.For consistency with other avelumab 
monotherapy protocols.

4/137Section # and 
NameDescription of Change Brief Rationale
Synopsis Study 
Intervention 
Groups and 
Section 6Added SoC option: carboplatin AUC 5 on 
Day 1 + pegylated liposomal doxorubicin 
(PLD) 30 mg/m2every [ADDRESS_1164714] previously received the 
agents.
Section 5.1: 
Inclusion 
CriteriaReduced minimum time of prior PARPi 
[INVESTIGATOR_838457] [ADDRESS_1164715] 4 months as sufficient minimum treatment to evaluate 
PARP resistance and to reduce screen 
failures due to PARP treatment time without impacting ability to evaluate treatment in patients with PARP resistance aligned withthe rationale for the combination treatment.
Section 5.1: 
Inclusion 
CriteriaMade the Part A two (2) paired biopsies 
optional instead of mandatory. Feedback from clinical sites reported 
feasibility of paired biopsies to be very low 
and could result in difficulty recruiting participants to Part A of trial, given that pharmacodynamics is a tertiary objective and 
safety is the primary determinant to accept the 
dose
Section 5.1: 
Inclusion 
Criteria and 
Appendix 3Contraception criteria was changed to: 
Contraception from [ADDRESS_1164716] dose during the study intervention period (Parts A 
and B), and for at least [ADDRESS_1164717] treatment.
Section 5.3.1: 
Meals and 
Dietary 
RestrictionsDeleted restrictions on food and beverages 
and specified no restrictions on meals or 
diet.Deleted food and beverage restrictions 
because M6620 is administered intravenously 
and will not be affected by [CONTACT_838492].
Section 6.3.2: 
BlindingAdded the following sentence: However, any 
aggregate summary of data, if required, will 
be provided only in a blinded way during the 
study, to limit bias in the conduct of the 
study.To further protect study integrity.
Section 6.6.1: 
Definition of 
Dose-limiting 
ToxicityThe definition of a DLT was clarified to: To provide clarification of when an IRR is a 
DLT.

“…any death not clearly due to the 
underlying disease or extraneous causes or any ≥Grade 3 nonhematologic or ≥Grade 4 
hematologic toxicity that is possibly, 
probably, or definitely related to any of the study interventions…except for any of the

management.
Section 6.11: 
Management of 
Adverse Events of Interest (Avelumab)Clarified that infusion-related reactions and 
irAEs should be handled according to the 
2018 ASCO guidelines.To clarify source of current guidance for
management of infusion-related reactions and 
irAEs.
Section 8.2.5: 
Safety and 
Data Monitoring 
CommitteesAdded:
“For Part B, a data monitoring committee 
(IDMC) will be constituted by [CONTACT_2728]’s 
members independent from the project team and if needed may include external medical 
expert [INVESTIGATOR_838535] B of 
the study to ensure safety of the participants as well validity and integrity of the study. The participants, data reporting details and 
specific working procedures will be defined in
the DMC charter prior to start of enrollment in Part B.”To ensure integrity of the trial data by 
[INVESTIGATOR_3086] a Data Monitoring Committee 
consisting of internal Sponsor staff not associated with the clinical study to review 
data during Part B of the study.

12/1371 Protocol Summary
1.1 Synopsis
Protocol Title: A Phase Ib Safety Run-in and Randomized Phase II, Op en-label Study to Evaluate 
the Efficacy, Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of M6620 in Combination with Avelumaband Carboplatin in Comparison to Standard of Care Therapy in Participants with PARPi-resistant Recurrent Ovarian, Primary Peritoneal or Fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_838458]: Phase Ib/ II Study of Carboplatin + M6620 + Avelumab in PARPi-resistant Ovarian
Cancer
Rationale: The purpose of Study MS201943-0029 is to evaluate the safety of the recommended 
Phase II dose (RP2D) of carboplatin +M6620 (doublet) when used in combination with avelumab (Part A; triplet) and the efficacy and safe ty of carboplatin + M6620 + avelumab therapy with 
avelumab maintenance compared to the standard of care (SoC; platinum-containing doublet chemotherapy with optional bevacizumab) (Part B) in  participants with recurrent ovarian, primary 
peritoneal, or fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_838459] a poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor (PARPi). Given that PARPi-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer with expected platinum sensitivity is associated with a high mutational load and homologous recombination deficiency, the combination treatment of a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-damaging agent (carboplatin) with a DNA damage response inhibitor (DDRi; M6620) and an immune checkpoint inhibitor (avelumab) is expected to synergize and lead to insufficient DNA repair, increased DNAmutations, immunologic cell death, and an increase in potential immunological targets within the tumor.

Avelumab + M6620 Phase Ib/II Study of Carboplatin + M6620 + Avelumab in PARPi-resistant
MS201943-0029 Ovarian Cancer
14/137Overall Design: This Phase Ib / II study is an open-label, randomized, controlled study consisting 
of 2 parts. Part A is a safety run-in dose de-escalation to identify a safe dose of carboplatin + M6620 in combination with avelumab for Part B. In Part B, participants will be randomly assigned to receive open-label treatment with either the triplet combination (carboplatin + M6620 + avelumab) or SoC (platinum-based doublet therapy with optional bevacizumab). Participants will be randomized (stratified by [CONTACT_76390] [breast cancer gene] status) to one of the treatment arms.
Number of Participants: During Part A of the study, approximately 3 to 18 participants are 
expected to be enrolled to evaluate the safe dose for the triplet combination (a modified 3 + 3 design, but dose reductions will be considered only if necessary). 
In Part B, a total of approximately 72 participants will be enrolled. Based on 50 events for 
progression-free survival (PFS), the probability to observe a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.6 or lower is 74% under the assumption of a true HR of 0.5; whereas, if the true HR is 0.75 (a nonrelevant effect regarding further development of this combination therapy for such an indication), the probability to observe a HR of 0.6 or lower is 21.5%, and if there is no effect (i.e., if the true HR = 1), the probability for an observed HR of 0.6 is 3.5%. To observe 50 PFS events, a sample size of N = 72 (with a 1:1 randomization, stratified by [CONTACT_838495]) has been chosen.
Study Intervention Groups and Duration: During Part A, participants will receive the triplet 
combination at starting doses of area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) 5 for carboplatin,90 mg/m
2for M6620, and 1600 mg for avelumab, for up to six 3-week cycles. The M6620 dose 
may be de-escalated to 60 mg/m2, 40 mg/m2, or another dose level upon recommendations by [CONTACT_631247]. After completion of the 6-cycles participants will continue in the maintenance treatment with avelumab, (800 mg every 2 weeks as monotherapy) until PD, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, death, or a minimum of 12 months of treatment following confirmed CR.
During Part B, participants will be randomly assigned to receive either carboplatin + M6620 (at 
the RP2D evaluated in Part A) in combination with avelumab or SoC treatment for up to 6 cycles.The SoC regimen is to be chosen by [CONTACT_838496]: 
!Carboplatin AUC 5 + paclitaxel 175 mg/m
2on Day 1; every 3 weeks for up to 6 cycles with or 
without bevacizumab, or 
!Carboplatin AUC 4 on Day 1 + Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2on Days 1 and 8; every 3 weeks for

17/1371.3 Schedule of Activities
A detailed schedule of study procedures and assessments are provided in  Table 1 for the 6 cycles 
of combination study intervention in Parts A and B; in Table 2 for avelumab maintenance 
treatment, end of treatment, and safety follow-up in Parts A and B; and in Table 3 for SoC
treatment, end of treatment, and safety follow-up in Part B. 
All Part A and Part B procedures are permitted to be performed up to 3 days before or 1 day after 
the scheduled visit, except as otherwise note d. The treatment schedule should be strictly adhered 
to, returning to the target date for Day 1 even if the previous treatment was off schedule. 
All participants discontinuing study intervention for any reason will undergo an End of Treatment 
(EoT) Visit within 7 days after the decision to discontinue study intervention, but (if possible) before any new antineoplastic therapy is started. 
The 30-day Safety Follow-up Visit (± 5 days) and 90-day Safety Follow-up Phone Call (± 5 days) 
should be conducted, if possible, prior to the start of any new antineoplastic therapy. 
Participants without PD at the EoT Visit will be followed for disease progression (CT/MRI scans 
every 9 weeks, and after 6 months from randomization, every 12 weeks) or start of subsequent anticancer therapy, whichever comes first.
Follow-up post study treatment discontinuation includes collection of subsequent anticancer 
treatment information and long-term survival status. Survival follow-up information will be documented every 12 weeks until participant’s death or end of study. Progression and survival follow-up will continue until end of study defined as  [ADDRESS_1164724].
Re-initiation of avelumab is possible for participants who experience a CR, discontinue treatment, 
progress, and later re-initiate treatment. The re-initiation Schedule of Activities (SoA) is presented in Table 2,  without M6620 and carboplatin treatment.

EOI.
!Cycle 2, Day 2: predose and M6620 EOI.
For ECGs matched to PK time points: perform 3 consecutive 12-lead ECGs 
(triplicates) approximately 2 minutes apart to determine mean QTc (average of triplicates) with digital upload for centralized analysis. Perform ECG assessment 
within 10 minutes prior to PK blood sample collection, such that the blood 
sample is collected at the nominal time. If ECG measurement is not feasibl e 
before PK collection, then perform ECG 10 minutes after sample collection to 
allow participants to recover to normal heart rate. See Section 8.2.3 for EC G 
assessment details in case of concurrent cardiac or neurologic AEs.
Tumor evaluation X Q9W Radiologic imaging and CA-125 assessment at Screening should be perfor med

Avelumab + M6620 Phase Ib/II Study of Carboplatin + M6620 + Avelumab in PARPi-resistant 
MS201943-0029 Ovarian Cancer
38/1372 Introduction
Avelumab is an intravenously administered programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1)-blocking human 
antibody. M6620 is a novel, intravenously administered ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) inhibitor (ATRi). This study will investigate carboplatin + M6620 in combination with avelumab in the treatment of participants with recurrent ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_838459] a maintenance treatment with a poly (ADP-ribose) 
polymerase (PARP) inhibitor (PARPi).
Complete information on the chemistry, pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of avelumab and 
M6620 is in the respective Investigator’s Brochures (IBs).
2.1 Study Rationale
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the sa fe RP2D of carboplatin + M6620 in combination 
with avelumab (Part A) and to evaluate the efficacy and safety of carboplatin + M6620 + avelumabcompared with the standard of care (SoC; platinum-containing chemotherapy) (Part B) in participants with recurrent ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_838465] a PARPi. Given that PARPi-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer and expected platinum sensitivity is associated with a high mutational load and homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) (Parmar 2003) , the combination treatment of a DNA-damaging agent 
(carboplatin) with a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage response inhibitor (DDRi; M6620) and an immune checkpoint inhibitor (avelumab) is expected to synergize and lead to insufficient DNA repair, increased DNA mutations, immunologic cell death, and an increase in potential immunological targets within the tumor.
For discussion of the scientific rationale for the study design, see Section 4.2, and for justification 
for dose, see Section 4.3.

cause of cancer mortality in women. Although many patients achieve complete remission after primary treatment with cytoreductive surgery and platinum- and taxane-based chemotherapy, up to 
80% of patients experience disease recurrence (Herzog 2017) . Patients with recurrent 
platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer may undergo second-line therapy with platinum-containing regimens. In such patients, typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] a med ian PFS time of around 9 months and a median overall 
survival (OS) time of around 30 months (ICON 4 [Parmar 2003] , CALYPSO
[Pujade-Lauraine 2010] , and OCEANS [Aghajanian 2012]  studies) is observed. For most patients, 
the benefit from treatment with platinum salts (carboplatin and cisplatin) is limited due to highly proficient cellular processes that can detect and repair damaged DNA. Nonclinical and clinical 
studies have shown that concurrent inhibition of DNA damage repair pathways enhances the cytotoxic effect of platinum compounds (Sundar 2017, Martin 2008, Hosoya 2014, Reaper 2011) .
Alterations in genes of the DNA repair pathway involving homologous recombination have been 
observed in approximately 50% of high-grade serous ovarian cancer (the most common histology)

39/137(Murai 2017) . These include 25% to 30% of mutations in BRCA1/[ADDRESS_1164778],
resulting in loss of heterozygosity (loss of entire genes and surrounding chromosomal regions) (Dockery 2017) . DNA is repaired by [CONTACT_27873], partially redundant pathways with BRCA1/2 
involved in error-free double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) break repair by [CONTACT_10579] 
(Vanderstichele 2017) . 
The presence of HRD is associated with favorable prognosis due to an enhanced sensitivity to 
platinum-based therapi[INVESTIGATOR_838466] a DNA damage response inhibitor (DDRi), including PARPi (Ventriglia 2017) . PARP repairs single-strand DNA breaks, which if left 
unrepaired, lead to dsDNA breaks during replication. When treated with PARPi, homologous recombination-deficient ovarian cancer cells rely on error-prone dsDNA repair systems and accumulate mutations or chromosomal changes, leading to cell death and substantial antitumor efficacy (Dockery 2017, Vanderstichele 2017, George 2017) Maintenance therapy with PARP 
inhibitors (olaparib [SOLO2; Pujade-Lauraine 2017] , niraparib [NOVA; Mirza 2016) , and 
rucaparib (ARIEL3; Coleman 2017] ) has been shown to significantly prolong PFS compared to 
placebo following response to platinum-based chemotherapy in women with platinum-sensitive epi[INVESTIGATOR_76296]. Some patients continue maintenance therapy for more than [ADDRESS_1164779] received treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy after 
failure to PARPi [INVESTIGATOR_838467] 6 months (Ang 2013) , depending on prior lines of treatment and the platinum-free interval. Multiple potential 
mechanisms of PARP inhibitor resistance have been reported (Konstantinopoulos 2015) . For 
example, based on preclinical experiments, PARPi-resistant, BRCA1-deficient cells are increasingly dependent on the ATR pathway for survival. ATR inhibitors (ATRi) disrupt BRCA1-independent RAD51 loading to DNA DSBs  in PARPi-resistant, BRCA1-deficient cells, 
overcoming such resistance mechanisms (Yazinski 2017) . ATRi may therefore potentially 
overcome PARPi-resistance in BRCA-deficient cancers. As another mechanism, PARPi [INVESTIGATOR_838468]-L1 expression, which atte nuates PARPi [INVESTIGATOR_838469]-associated 
immunosuppression (Jiao 2017) . This provides a rationale for combined treatment with a DDRi and 
a PD-L1-targeting agent.
Avelumab is an intravenously administered PD-L1-blocking human antibody. PD-L1 is a ligand 
of programmed death 1 (PD-1), a negative regulator of T cell activity that limits the activity of T cells at a variety of stages of the immune response (Ishida 1992, Keir 2006, Freeman 2000) . 
When engaged by a ligand, PD-1 inhibits pathways that normally lead to T cell activation. Blocking PD-1, for example with a PD-L1 antibody, thus can restore an inhibited T cell activation and lead to effective tumor reduction. Furthermore, PD-L1-blocking antibodies such as avelumab also enhance the function of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), which augments antitumor immunity within the tumor microenvironment. T hus, PD-1+ TILs have been shown to be 
indicators of response to immune checkpoint blockade, and a lack of TILs may be a predictive marker for lack of response to PD-1/L1 blockade (Curran 2010, Huang 2011, Herbst 2014) . A

40/137number of antibodies that disrupt the PD-1 axis are approved and/or are in clinical development 
for several tumor indications.
Avelumab is currently being evaluated in monotherapy or in combination with several 
chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_14953] a number of clinical studies, including a Phase III st udy in combination with 
carboplatin/paclitaxel versus carboplatin/paclitaxel alone in previously untreated epi[INVESTIGATOR_76296] (JAVELIN Ovarian 100;  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). A total of 951 participants are planned for 
enrollment. As of 11 December 2017, 790 participan ts had received treatment. Another Phase III 
study is exploring avelumab alone or in combin ation with PEGylated liposomal doxorubicin versus 
PEGylated liposomal doxorubicin alone in patients with platinum resistant/refractory ovarian cancer (JAVELIN Ovarian 200; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). In total, 546 participants (550 planned) were dosed as of the data cutoff date of 11 December 2017 (current avelumab Investigator’s Brochure [IB]). The preliminary safety data from these and othe r studies with different tumor types suggest 
an acceptable safety profile of the compound as e xpected in participants with advanced tumor 
disease or in line with class effects of mAb blocking the PD 1/PD L1 axis (Avelumab IB version 8, 16 May 2018).
Inhibition of DNA damage response (DDR) is expected to synergize with PD-L1-targeting agents 
such as avelumab, because insufficient DNA repair may lead to increased DNA mutations, resulting in an increase in potential immunological targets (“neoantigens”) within the tumor. This could increase the antitumor efficacy of a treatment acting by [CONTACT_358056] a patient’s immune response toward a tumor.
Furthermore, the synthetic lethality observed after ATR inhibition in tumors with additional 
DDR-gene deficiencies in situations of replicative stress may result in the induction of immunogenic cell death. This is expected to synergize with PD-L1-directed activation of the patient’s immune response against the tumor and result in clinical benefit. In the Phase I Study VX13-970-002, participants with advanced solid tumors received treatment with different doses of M6620 + DNA-damaging chemotherapy, including carboplatin.

In preclinical studies, chemotherapy agents that induce DNA damage have been shown to promote 
immune antitumor activity in addition to inducing direct cytotoxic activity (Zhao 2017,
Ursic 2018)  and, as a result, are expected to synergize with immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], such as avelumab. 
Consistent with these observations, the combination of avelumab with DNA-damaging agentsresults in robust synergistic antitumor activity in murine models. 
The cytotoxic activity of DNA-damaging agents, including carboplatin, can be further enhanced 
in vivo when combined with M6620. M6620 also enhances in vitro immunogenic cell death induced by [CONTACT_100660]-damaging agents. In addition, the combination of chemotherapy with M6620 is

41/137hypothesized to increase neoantigen load in tumors, thereby [CONTACT_838499][INVESTIGATOR_014], such as avelumab (Mouw 2017) . 
Finally, it has been reported that combining DNA-damaging agents with DDR inhibitors results in 
greater and more persistent DNA damage, and it is  expected that such combination may promote 
stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway activation and expression of Th1 cytokines (Hartlova 2015, Chen 2016) . Altogether, these data support the rationale of combining avelumab 
with a DNA-damaging chemotherapy agent and M6620. 
2.3 Benefit/Risk Assessment
The combination of carboplatin (area under the concentration-time curve [AUC] 5) + M6620 at the dose of 90 mg/m
2has shown an acceptable safety profile and early signs of efficacy in the
first-in-human clinical studies. With an established safety and efficacy profile, avelumab is currently approved in several countries for the treatment of metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma and in the [LOCATION_002] and Israel for locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma. Additional indications (e.g., non-small cell lung, gastric, and ovarian cancers) are currently being evaluated 
in several ongoing Phas e III studies. Based on the mechanisms of action and the available 
nonclinical information, and except for potential infusion-related reactions, no synergis tic toxicities 
for the triplet combination that includes avelumab are expected. The proposed study intervention provides the possibility of substantial antitumor efficacy in ovarian cancer patients who are resistant to PARP inhibition and thus have limited treatment options. Together with the safety profile of the compounds, this results in a positive benefit-risk ratio in these patients. 
Specific risks associated with the use of avelumab as a monoclonal antibody have been observed. 
The primary risks of exposure to avelumab include: 
!infusion-related reactions 
!immune-related adverse events (irAEs).
Specific risks associated with the use of M6620 with platinum therapy have been observed. The 
primary risks of exposure to carboplatin + M6620 include: 
!infusion-related reactions 
!enhanced myelosuppressive effect of carboplatin (especially thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, 
and anemia).
Currently, no safety data on the doublet combination of avelumab and M6620 are available; 
however, apart from infusion-related reactions that have been observed for both avelumab and M6620 and that are considered to be manageable by [CONTACT_838500], no synergistic toxicity for this combination is expected. This is further indirectly supported by [CONTACT_838501]6738 with the anti-PD-L1 antibody durvalumab (MEDI4736) (Yap 2016, Sundar 2017) , which reported the combination was well 
tolerated. Nonetheless, the triplet combination of carboplatin, M6620, and avelumab at the RP2D for carboplatin + M6620 will be evaluated during a Safety Run-in Period (Part A) prior to the start of the Randomized Treatment Period (Part B) of the study.

4 Study Design
4.1 Overall Design
This is a 2-part (Part A: safety run-in; Part  B: randomized), open-label, controlled, Phase II study 
to evaluate the efficacy and safety of avelumab in combination with carboplatin + M6620 in participants with PARPi-resistant recurrent ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_76351].
Part A is a safety run-in that will evaluate a safe RP2D dose of the triplet combination 
(carboplatin + M6620 + avelumab). Participants will be enrolled following a modified 3 + 3 designstarting with the established doses of avelumab and the carboplatin + M6620 combination withde-escalation of M6620 doses if needed. 
Participants i n Part A will receive carboplatin + M6620 + avelumab every 3 weeks  for 6 cycles. 
Treatment w ith avelumab will continue beyond carboplatin + M6620. Particip ants will be 
monitored fo r dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) (defined in Section 6.6.1)  by a Safet y Monitoring 
Committee (S MC) (see Section 8.2.5) . The DLT observation period is defined as [ADDRESS_1164782] treatment. If at any time ≥2 DLTs are observed, treatment with the c orresponding 
dose will be s topped and the next lower dose will be considered, as shown in the Pa rt A Schema (

received the first planned full doses of M6620, avelumab, and carboplatin (including premedication) and completed all planned safety assessments in Cycle 1 or received any treatment and experience a DLT. Participants who do not complete the DLT observation period for reasons other than a DLT will be replaced. 
Upon selection of a safe RP2D of the triplet comb ination in Part A, any participants who are 
receiving the triplet combination at a dose level higher than the RP2D  will be de-e scalated to the 
safe RP2D for the remaining every-3-week cy cles, for a total of 6 infusions of the triplet 
combination. After receiving 6 infusions of the triplet combination during Part A, participants with ongoing treatment will receive avelumab maintenan ce therapy every 2 weeks until progressive 
disease (PD), unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or death. 
In Part B of the study, to investigate the efficacy of the recommended triplet combination dose (as 
established in Part A), 72 participants (N = 36/treatment arm) will be stratified by [CONTACT_838503] (1:1) to receive either the study intervention, (a treatment regimen of carboplatin + M6620 + avelumab for 6 cycles) or SoC (a treatment regimen with Investigatorchoice of platinum-based doublet treatment for 6 cycles) (

4.3 Justification for Dose
4.3.1 M6620
In a M6620 monotherapy dose escalation study, no participants experienced any DLTs with a 
maximum administered dose of 480 mg/m2(O’Carrigan 2016) . M6620 was generally well 
tolerated as a single agent, with few AEs leading to study drug discontinuation. 
The RP2D of M6620 in combination with carboplatin (AUC 5) has been established at 90 mg/m2
from Phase I studies of M6620 (refer to the M6620 IB for additional details). Among participants 
treated at this dose level (M6620 90 mg/m2+ carboplatin AUC 5), 1 DLT of Grade 3 febrile 
neutropenia was reported (Study MS201923-0002 Part B1). The combination treatment was 
otherwise well tolerated (O’Carrigan 2016) .Table 6 provides a summary of relevant data from the 
studies VX12-970-001/MS201923-0001 (Part C3) and VX13-970-002 (Parts B1 and C).

[IP_ADDRESS] Evidence of Pharmacodynamic Effects of M6620 in 
Combination with Carboplatin
DNA damage, such as  that induced by [CONTACT_104124], results in ATR-dependent phosphorylation of 
Checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1). In preclinical studies, ATR inhibition was shown to inhibit Chk1 phosphorylation following DNA-damaging chemotherapy. Inhibition of Chk1 phosphorylation following ATR inhibitor treatment, as assessed by [CONTACT_9064], was also observed in the clinical Study VX-12-970-002/MS201923-0002. In this  study, paired biopsies were obtained 
before and after administration of M6620 in 12 participants who received carboplatin followed by M6620. Of these 5 participants had detectable levels of phospho-Chk1 prior to administration of M6620, 5 participants receiving 90 mg/m
2of M6620 had decreases of phospho-Chk1 of 29%, 
73%, and 73%, while 1 participant at 90 mg/m2had a 69% increase in phospho-Chk1. One 
participant at 120 mg/m2had a 94% decrease in phospho-Chk1. However, 120 mg/m2of M6620 
was determined to be above the RP2D in combination with carboplatin. Collectively, these data support the selection of the 90-mg/m
2dose of M6620 in combination with carboplatin and 
avelumab.
4.3.2 Avelumab
Avelumab has been studied and shown to be well tolerated from 1 to 20 mg/kg every 2 weeks in Phase I dose escalation study where maximum tolerated dose was not reached. The clinically active dose of 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks has shown a tolerable and manageable safety profile in more than 
1700 participants across multiple tumor types. The avelumab dosing regimen of 10 mg/kg every [ADDRESS_1164787] progressed following platinum-containing chemotherapy. 
Avelumab was originally dosed on a mg/kg basis with the aim of reducing interparticipant 
variability in drug exposure. However, modeling and simulation of a large body of avelumab PK 
data indicate that a flat dose (i.e., body weight independent) would lead to slightly less variability 
compared with body weight-bas ed dosing due to a modest effect of body weight on avelumab 
clearance. A similar phenomenon has also been re ported with other antibody drugs, which include 
the marketed anti-PD-1 and PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors nivolumab, pembrolizumab, and 
atezolizumab (Wang 2009,  Freshwater 2017,  Zhao 2017,  Stroh 2017) . Given this finding, a 
flat-dose regimen is considered a favorable option which can also offer other advantages such as fewer dispensing errors, less drug wastage, shorter dose preparation times, and greater ease of administration. 
Consequently, a flat dose of avelumab of 800 mg ev ery 2 weeks has been proposed as a regimen 
comparable to 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks based on the following considerations. The introduction of 800 mg every 2 weeks was based on population PK analysis, with data across 3 single-agent 
'RFXPHQW1R

MS201943-0029 Ovarian Cancer
49/137avelumab studies in [ADDRESS_1164788] 
that exposures to avelumab across the available range of body weights ar e less variable, with 
800 mg every 2 weeks compared with 10 mg/kg ev ery 2 weeks; exposures were similar near the 
population median weight. Low-weight participants tended toward marginally lower exposures relative to the rest of the population when wei ght-based dosing was used, and marginally higher 
exposures when flat dosing was applied. However, the implications of these exposure differences are not expected to be clinically meaningful at any weight across the entire population. Furthermore, the dosing regimen of 800 mg every 2 weeks is expected to result in C
trough >1μg/mL 
required to maintain avelumab serum concentrations at > 95% target occupancy (TO) throughout the entire 2-week dosing interval in all weight categories.
However, in the situation where avelumab is to be combined with chemotherapy that has a 3-week 
treatment cycle, avelumab dosing once every 3 weeks is expected to further improve convenience and compliance. For this purpose, exposures of different dose levels of avelumab given every 3 weeks were simulated. The results showed that 1600 mg every 3 weeks dosing would maintain avelumab exposure within the range demonstrated to provide high TO and meaningful antitumor activity. Specifically, avelumab concentration at 1600 mg every 3 weeks would remainabove the C
trough of 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks for 18.2 days out of 21 days (the cycle duration) and
would be 10-fold higher than the concentration (1 μg/mL) required to achieve > 95% TO in 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (based on in vitro TO experiments) for the whole 21-day duration. The simulated median AUC at 1600 mg every 3 weeks is 47% higher than that obtained with a 10-mg/kg dose every 2 weeks. The simulated median C
maxat 1600 mg every 3 weeks is 
comparable to that from a 20-mg/kg dose every 2 week s, previously studied in the Phase I study, 
which did not show any safety concerns. 
In this study, the 2 regimens of avelumab (800 mg every 2 weeks and 1600 mg every 3 weeks) 
will be employed. The regimen of 1600 mg every 3 weeks was chosen for evaluation in the carboplatin + M6620 + avelumab combination to align with the 3-week treatment cycle for chemotherapy and M6620 administration. During the avelumab maintenance phase, avelumab will be administered as a monotherapy using a regimen of 800 mg every 2 weeks, as synchronization with the M6620 and carboplatin regimens will no longer be necessary.

[IP_ADDRESS] Prophylactic Medications and Treatments
Table 9 lists the prophylactic medications that should be administered prior to the administrations 
of avelumab and/or M6620.
Table 9 Prophylactic Medications Administered Prior to Avelumab and/or 
M6620
Avelumab M6620 Comment
Antihistamine
XXe.g., either 10 mg of chlorphenamine or 25 mg of 
diphenhydramine iv approximately 30 to 60 minutes before the infusions, or alternative 
drugs as per local guidelines
Corticosteroids
X100 mg to 200 mg hydrocortisone iv
approximately 60 minutes (± 15 minutes) before 
M6620 infusion
Acetaminophen (paracetamol)X500-650 mg approximately 30 to 60 minutes 
before the infusions.
iv=intravenous.
For avelumab, premedication is mandatory prior to th e first 4 doses, and thereafter is based upon 
clinical judgment and presence/severity of prior infusion reactions. Standard prophylactic 
premedication with corticosteroids is not recommended; however, prophylactic steroids to prevent recurrence of infusion-related reaction are not prohibited, based on the Investigator’s clinical judgment.
Premedication with a corticosteroid and an antihistamine should be given to participants who have 
developed acute hypersensitivity or pruritus with M6620 infusion and who continue to receive treatment with M6620.
For carboplatin and other SoC treatments, premedications (e.g., antiemetics, corticosteroids, etc.) 
should be administered according to the local institutional treatment standards.
Premedications and their regimens may be modif ied based on local treatment stan dards and 
guidelines as appropriate.

6.6.1 Definition of Dose-limiting Toxicity
A DLT is specifically defined as any death not clearly due to the underlying disease or extraneous 
causes or any Grade ≥3 nonhematologic or Grade ≥[ADDRESS_1164807] udy interventions (carboplatin, M6620, or avelumab) 
or the combination (as assessed by [CONTACT_11219]/or Sponsor) that occurs during the 3-week DLT observation period, except for any of the following:
!Grade 3 infusion-related reaction resolving within 6 hours from the end of infusion and 
controlled with medical management.
!Transient ( ≤6 hours) Grade 3 flu-like symptoms or fever, which is controlled with medical 
management.
!Transient ( ≤72 hours) Grade 3 fatigue, local reactions, headache, nausea, emesis that resolves 
to Grade≤1 with medical management.
!Grade [ADDRESS_1164808] increase (ALT or AST) 
that resolves to Grade ≤1 in less than 3 days after medical management (e.g.,
immunosuppressant or antidiarrheal treatment) has been initiated. EXCEPTION: Grade [ADDRESS_1164809] increases that are assessed as irAEs will still be considered a DLT.
!Single laboratory values out of normal range that, according to the Investigator, do not have 
any clinical correlate, and resolve to Grade ≤1 within 7 days with adequate medical 
management.
!Tumor flare phenomenon defined as local pain, irritation, or rash localized at sites of known or 
suspected tumor that resolve to Grade ≤2 within 3 days.
!Neutropenia (Grade 3 or 4) less than 7 days not associated with any infection (clinically or 
microbiolog ically). NO TE: Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia with clinical signs/symptoms (e.g., febrile 
neutropenia) is a DLT.

!Participant was allocated to receive avelumab, and treatment with avelumab is ongoing
!No new unacceptable treatment or disease-related toxicity
!Tolerance of study interventions
!Stable ECOG PS
!Treatment beyond progression will not delay an imminent intervention to prevent serious 
complications of disease progression (for example, central nervous system metastases).
A radiographic assessment should be performed within 4 to 6 weeks of original PD to determine 
whether there has been a decrease in the tumor size, or continued PD. The assessment of clinical benefit should be balanced by [CONTACT_838514](s).
6.7.2 Treatment Beyond Confirmed Progression
After confirmed PD, if the Investigator feels that the participant continues to achieve clinical benefit by [CONTACT_838515], with or without carboplatin and M6620, the participant should remain on the study and continue to receive monitoring according to the SoA. The decision to continue treatment beyond confirmed PD should be discussed with the Medical Monitor and documented in the study records.
Participants receiving avelumab who continue beyond progression will be evaluated for further 
tumor response as per the protocol schedule. Treatment should be discontinued permanently upon documentation of further, unequivocal disease progre ssion unless there are no altern ative 
therapeutic options and the benefit-risk assessment is favorable in consultation betwee n the 
Investigator and the Medical Monitor. In case of continu ation of treatment beyond PD, treat ment 
will be discontinued once any other criteria for withdraw al are met (see Section  7.1).

Disease Progression
If disease progression is due to brain metastasis, pa rticipants may continue study interventions 
after the local treatment of the brain lesions provided that the above criteria are met in addition to the following:
!Tumor assessment showing disease progression has been performed and was documented 
according to RECIST v1.1 prior to the procedure.
!Brain metastases have been treated locally and are clinically stable for at least 2 weeks prior to 
re-initiation of study interventions. 
!There are no ongoing neurological symptoms that are related to the brain localization of the 
disease (sequelae that are a consequence of the treatment of the brain metastases are acceptable).
!Participants must be either off steroids or on a stable or decreasing dose of ≤10 mg daily 
prednisone (or equivalent).
!Benefit-risk assessment to continue study in tervention is favorable under consideration of any 
alternative treatment options as assessed by [CONTACT_737].
In addition, if disease progression is mainly due to a metastatic lesion that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_107912], participants may continue study interventions after the local treatment of such a lesion, provided that:
!Tumor assessment showing disease progression has been performed and was documented 
according to RECIST v1.1 prior to the procedure.
!It has been at least 2 weeks and the participant has fully recovered from the surgery.
!Benefit-risk assessment to continue study intervention is favorable under consideration of any 
alternative treatment options as assessed by [CONTACT_737].
6.9 Study Intervention After the End of the Study
After a participant has completed the study or has withdrawn early, usual treatment will be 
administered, if required, in accordance with the investigational site’s SoC, generally accepted medical practice, and depending on the participant’s individual medical needs. The Sponsor will not provide any additional care to participants who have discontinued the study because such care should not differ from what is normally expected for participants with advanced malignancies.
Upon withdrawal from the study, participants may receive whatever care they and their physicians 
agree upon.
Survival follow-up will continue for participants until up to [ADDRESS_1164811]. The Sponsor may terminate the study at any time and there may be  allowance for participants to enter a rollover 
study, or other mechanism for avelumab access for Part A or Part B participants if randomized to that treatment, as appropriate.

hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., dexamethasone 10 mg and epi[INVESTIGATOR_75447] a 1:1000 dilution or  
equivalents) should always be available along with equipment for assisted ventilation.
Prophylactic medications and treatments are outlined in Section 6.5.2.  The treatment  
recommendations for infusion-related reactions are outlined in Section 6.11.  
Investigators should also monitor participants closely for potential irAEs, which may occur at any  
time during treatment. Such events include, but are not limited to, pneumonitis, hepatitis, colitis,  
endocrinopathies (hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, type 1 diabetes  
mellitus), myocarditis, myositis, and rash. See Section 6.[ADDRESS_1164813] measures should be employed to  
ameliorate these symptoms (including removal of the infusion catheter and resumption of infusion  
through a different vein). If standard procedures to limit symptoms of injection site reaction, or  
pruritus or acute hypersensitivity are insufficient, then the infusion time may be extended beyond  
60 minutes, but no more than 90 minutes.
Based on the observation of acute hypersensitivity in 3 participants at various doses of M6620 and  
of pruritus in 2 participants at 480 mg/m2of M6620, premedication with a corticosteroid and an  
antihistamine may be considered for all participants receiving M6620 (as prophylaxis against  
possible acute hypersensitivity). In addition, corticosteroids and antihistamine should be used for  
treatment of participants who develop acute hypersensitivity or pruritus after M6620 infusion, and  
should be used prophylactically as premedication for all participants who develop acute  
hypersensitivity or pruritus with M6620 infusion and who continue to receive treatment with  
M6620 (see Section 6.5.2) .

76/137!Should the participant continue to be unreachable, he/she will be considered to have withdrawn 
from the study.
8 Study Assessments and Procedures
!Study assessments and procedures and their timing are summarized in the SoA (Section 1.3).
!Noprotocol waivers or exemptions are allowed.
!Immediate safety concerns should be discussed with the Sponsor immediately upon occurrence 
or awareness to determine if the participant should continue or discontinue study intervention.
!Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the SoA (Section 1.3), 
is essential and required for study conduct.
!All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential participants 
meet all eligibility criteria. The Investigator will maintain a screening log to record details of all participants screened, to confirm eligibility, and if applicable, record reasons for screening failure.
!Prior to performing any study assessments that are not part of the participant’s routine medical 
care, the Investigator will obtain written informed consent as specified in Appendix 2.
!Procedures conducted as part of the participant’s routine medical care (e.g., blood count) and 
obtained before signing of the ICF may be used for screening or baseline purposes provided the 
procedures met the protocol-specified criteria and were performed within the time frame defined in the SoA (Section 1.3).
!Order of Procedures:
oPatient-reported outcomes assessments should be completed by [CONTACT_212585] a 
health care intervention of any nature, regardless of whether it is study-related. A protocol deviation occurs only when study-related interventions occur prior to PRO assessments, other than vital signs, demographics, and clinical history information.
oElectrocardiogram assessments should be performed prior to blood sample collection, such 
that the blood sample is collected at the nominal time. However, at the PK time points where the acceptable window of sample collection is within 5 minutes, the ECG should be performed 10 minutes after sample collection to allow participants to recover to normal heart rate. 
8.1 Efficacy Assessments and Procedures
8.1.1 Tumor Response Assessment
Computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans will be performed and 
collected until confirmed PD is assessed by [CONTACT_255714] v1.1
(Eisenhauer 2009)  or until start of new anticancer therapy in case of continuation of avelumab 
beyond PD, according to the SoA (Section 1.3).

MS201943-0029 Ovarian Cancer
77/137For participants receiving avelumab, a subsequent scan 4 to 6 weeks after the initial assessment of 
PD should be collected if clinically feasible to confirm PD. 
Radiographic images and physical findings (physical assessments) will be used by [CONTACT_838517]’s treatment decisions. 
For each participant, tumor response assessment will be performed by [CONTACT_5711] (if MRI is 
used, chest CT is mandatory) imaging of the chest/abdomen/pelvis (plus other regions as specifically required) and other established assessments of tumor burden if CT/MRI imaging is insufficient for the individual participant. All scans performed at Screening and other imaging performed as clinically required (other supportive imaging) need to be repeated at subsequent visits. In general, lesions detected at Screening need to be followed using the same imaging methodology and preferably the same imaging equipment at subsequent tumor evaluation visits.
For each participant, the Investigator will designate 1 or more of the following measures of tumor 
status to follow for determining response: CT or MRI images of primary and/or metastatic tumor masses, physical examination findings, and the results of other assessments. All available images collected during the study period will be considered. The most appropriate measures to evaluate the tumor status of a participant should be used. The measure(s) to be chosen for sequential evaluation during the study must co rrespond to the measures used to document the progressive 
tumor status that qualifies the partic ipant for enrollment. The t umor response assessment will be 
assessed and listed according to the SoA (Section 1.3).
Treatment decisions will be made b y the Investigator based on  the Investigator’s assessment of 
disease status. Investigator’s assessment of objective tumor response to treatment will be performed according to RECIST v1.1 (all measurements should be recorded in metric notation, as described in RECIST v1.1).
!At Baseline, tumor lesions will be categorized in target and nontarget lesions as described in 
RECIST v1.1.
!Results for these evaluations will be recorded with as much specificity as possible so that 
pretreatment and post-treatment results will provide the best opportunity for evaluating tumor 
response. 
!Any CR or PR should be confirmed, preferably at the next subsequent scheduled imaging
interval, but no sooner than 6 weeks after the initial documentation of CR or PR. Confirmation of PR can be confirmed at an assessment later than the next assessment after the initial documentation of PR.
!The Investigator may perform scans in addition to a scheduled study scan for medical reasons 
or if the Investigator suspects PD. Participants who withdraw from the investigational treatment 
for clinical or symptomatic deterioration before objective documentation of PD or who discontinue from investigational treatment for reasons other than objective PD will be requested to continue appropriate imaging according to the study schedule until determination of confirmed PD or discontinuation of the study, whichever occurs earlier. Every effort should be made to confirm a clinical diagnosis of PD by [CONTACT_9661].

79/137Participants will be followed every 12 weeks (± 1 week) for survival (including assessment of any 
further antitumor therapy). The survival follow-up will continue until [ADDRESS_1164827]. Under some circumstances, participan ts may not be followed for 1 year for survival 
in this study; e.g., participants may be offered to enroll into a rollover study, or the Sponsor may terminate the study early.
8.1.4 Patient-reported Outcomes
Patient-reported outcomes will be distributed in paper form, accompanied by [CONTACT_838518], exclusively for Part B participants and according to the So A (Section 1.3).
If the participant is illiterate, blind, or too ill to complete PRO measures, the study staff (e.g., Study 
Coordinator, Investigator, or Subinvestigator) may obtain the participant’s respo nses by [CONTACT_838519]’s response. No help should be provided to the participant by [CONTACT_838520]. The designated study staff should not influence the participant’s responses by [CONTACT_61076], such as commenting, agreeing, or disagreeing with responses, either verbally or nonverbally. The designated study staff cannot translate the question into simpler language, and questions must be read verbatim. Any content may be repeated and/or read more slowly for clarification upon participant request. These instances must be documented as notes to file and included in the study site file.
The baseline assessments should be completed at Sc reening; if this does not occur, they can be 
done at Visit 1 (Day 1).
Whenever possible, the PRO assessments should be completed by [CONTACT_212585] a health 
care intervention of any nature, regardless of whether it is study-related or not. This sequencing is important to reduce measurement bias as the participant’s assessment should reflect the participant’s impressions up to a given visit; any intervention administered on that visit would be captured in the subsequent assessment. Any interve ntion on a given visit may bias the participant’s 
responses positively or negatively and may no longer be an accurate reflection of the participant’s impressions leading up to that visit. A protocol deviation occurs only when study-related interventions are done prior to PRO assessments, other than vital signs, demographics and clinical 
history information.
Data will be collected by [CONTACT_112623] (CRO) and housed in a database. 
Analysis of the questionnaires will be described in the Integrated Analysis Plan (IAP).
[IP_ADDRESS] EORTC QLQ-30
The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a cancer-specific health-related quality-of-life questionnaire that has
been widely used in clinical studies and investigations using PROs for individual participant 
management (Fayers 2001) . It includes 5 function domains (physical, emotional, social, role, 
cognitive), 8 symptoms (fatigue, pain, nausea/vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, insomnia, dyspnea, 
and appetite loss), as well as global health/quality-of-life and financial impact. Participants 
respond on a 4-point scale from “not at all” to “very much” for most items. Most items use a “past

MS201943-0029 Ovarian Cancer
80/137week” recall period. Raw scores can be linearly converted to a 0–100 scale with higher scores 
reflecting higher levels of function and higher levels of symptom burden. A subset of items from 
the QLQ-C30 will be used in this study; namely, fatigue (3 items), appetite loss (1 item), overall 
quality of life (QoL) (1 item), and physical function (5 items).
[IP_ADDRESS] EORTC QLQ-OV28
The EORTC QLQ-OV28 is a 28-item PRO questionnaire created to measure the cardinal 
symptoms of ovarian cancer (Greimel 2003) . Items measure pain, bloating, bowel habit, flatulence, 
early satiety, dyspepsia, neuropathy, sensory problems, and frequent urination. Each of these items 
is rated on a 4-point scale from “not at all” to “ver y much,” using the past week as the recall period. 
The QLQ-OV28 is scored similarly to the QLQ-C30, with raw scores linearly transformed to a 
0-100 scale, with higher scores higher levels of symptom burden. A subset of items from the 
QLQ-OV28 will be used in this study; namely, pain (1 item), bloating (1 item), early satiety 
(1 item), indigestion (1 item), and urinary frequency (1 item).
[IP_ADDRESS] Patient Global Impression of Severity
The Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGIS) is a single, global item assessing the 
participant’s perception of overall symptom severity (Yalcin 2003;  Tinchello 2013) . The PGIS 
provides a method for classifying participants as having improved, declined, or not having changed for use in exploratory and psychometric analysis, and to evaluate the sensitivity and responsiveness 
of individual symptom items and interpret scores on the PRO instruments. 
8.2 Safety Assessments and Procedures
The safety profile of the study intervention w ill be assessed through the recording, reporting and 
analysis of baseline medical conditions, AEs, physical ex amination findings, vital signs, ECGs, 
and laboratory tests.
Comprehensive assessment of any potential toxicity experienced by [CONTACT_108097]. Assessments are performed at each visit  prior to administration of any medications. The 
Investigator will report any AEs, whethe r observed by [CONTACT_838521]; the reporting period is specifie d in Section 8.3.1 (Time  Period and Frequency for 
Collecting Adverse Event and Serious A dverse Event Informatio n). Due to the combined 
administration of treatments in this study, it is important that the Inves tigator carefully review and 
attempt to differentiate causality of AEs (for carboplatin, M6620 , or avelumab) to ensure 
appropriate toxicity treatment recommendations.
8.2.1 Physical Examinations
!A complete physical examination will include, at a minimum, assessments of general 
appearance and dermatological, pulmonary, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, 
lymphatic, neurologic and musculoskeletal systems, head/neck, extremities, eyes, ears, nose, throat, and cognitive status. Height (at Screening) and weight will also be measured and

81/137recorded according to the SoA (Section 1.3). If Screening physical examination is done within 
3 days of Visit 1 (Day 1), it does not have to be repeated at Visit 1.
!A brief physical examination will include, at a minimum, assessments of the skin, lungs, 
cardiovascular system, and abdomen (liver  and spleen) and should be a focused physical 
examination with attention paid to irAEs. 
!Investigators should pay special attention to clinical signs related to previous serious illnesses.
All newly diagnosed or worsening conditions, signs, and symptoms observed from Screening, 
whether related to study intervention or not, are to be reported as AEs.
!The ECOG PS will be documented during Screening and at each visit according to the SoA 
(Section 1.3) and document in the eCRF. If the Screening ECOG PS was performed within 
[ADDRESS_1164828] to be repeated at Day 1.
8.2.2 Vital Signs
!Oral or tympanic temperature, pulse rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and blood pressure will be assessed.
!Blood pressure and pulse measurements will be assessed with a completely automated device. 
Manual techniques will be used only if an automated device is not available.
!Blood pressure and pulse measurements should be preceded by [CONTACT_2669] [ADDRESS_1164829]
for the participant in a quiet setting without distractions (e.g., television, cell phones).
!Vital signs (to be taken before blood collection for laboratory tests; see SoA in Section 1.3) will 
consist of 1 pulse and 3 blood pressure measurements ([ADDRESS_1164830] 1 minute). The average of the 3 blood pressure readings will be recorded on the eCRF.
8.2.3 Electrocardiograms
Scheduled 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) will be recorded after the participant has been in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_838479] 5 minutes.
Electrocardiogram assessments should be performed prior to blood sample collection, such that 
the blood sample is collected at the nominal time. However, at the PK time points where the acceptable window of sample collection is within 5 minutes, the ECG should be performed 10 minutes after sample collection to allow participants to recover to normal heart rate. 
!Triplicate or single 12-lead ECG will be obtained as outlined in the SoA (Section 1.3)using an 
ECG machine that automatically calculates the heart rate and measures PR, QRS, QT, and QTc 
intervals. See Section 7(Discontinuation of Study Intervention and Participant/ Withdrawal) 
for QTc withdrawal criteria and any additional QTc readings that may be necessary.
!At each time point at which triplicate ECG are required, 3 individual ECG tracings should be 
obtained as closely as possible in succession, but no more than 2 minutes apart. The full set of 
triplicates should be completed in less than 4 minutes.

!All participants require a single ECG measurement at Screening.
!On-treatment ECGs will be performed predose (within 4 hours) on Day 1 (before avelumab and 
carboplatin administration) and on Day 2 (before M6620 administration) of Cycles 1 and 2. On 
those days, 3 consecutive 12-lead ECGs (triplicate) will be performed at each PK time point for M6620, approximately 2 minutes apart to determin e mean QTc (average of triplicates) with 
digital upload for centralized analysis.
!PK-matched digital ECGs will be collected to evaluate if there is any relationship between 
treatment exposure and cardiovascular toxicity (e.g., QTc prolongation). These will be 
performed in triplicate in order to reduce the variability and improve the reliability of the measured QTc intervals.
!If a participant experiences a cardiac or neurologic AE (specifically syncope, dizziness, 
seizures, or stroke), triplicate ECGs should be obtained at the time of the event. If the mean 
QTc is prolonged (> 500 msec), the ECGs should be re-evaluated by a qualified person at the study site for confirmation and repeated as clinically indicated. Additional triplicate ECGs may 
be performed as clinically indicated.
8.2.4 Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments
!Blood and ur ine samples will be collected for the clinical laboratory tests list ed in Appendix 7,  
at the time p oints listed in the SoA (Section 1.3). All samples should be clear ly identified. 
!Thyroid-stim ulating hormone, thyroxine, and urinalysis will be assessed a t the time points 
defined in th e SoA (Section 1.3). If confirmation of a participant’s postme nopausal status is 
necessary, m easurement of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels will als o be performed at 
Screening.
!For WOCB P, serum and urine β-human chorionic gonadotropin pregna ncy tests will be 
performed as indicated in the SoA (Section  1.3).
!Additional te sts may be performed at any time during the study, as determine d necessary by [CONTACT_56861].
!The tests will be performed by [CONTACT_12082].
!The Sponsor must receive a list of the local laboratory normal ranges before shipment of study 
interventions. Any changes to the ranges during the study must be forwarded to the Sponsor or 
designated organization.
!The Investigator must review each laboratory report, document their review, and record any 
clinically relevant changes occurring during the study in the AE section of the eCRF. The 
laboratory reports must be filed with the source documents.

83/1378.2.5 Safety and Data Monitoring Committees 
A Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) consists of permanent members from the Sponsor and/or 
CRO (clinical development lead, medical responsible, biostatistician, and global patient safety representative), the Coordinating Investigator, and other optional members with expertise in relevant areas (e.g., immune-oncology, DDR, clinical pharmacology) as well as treating Investigators, as required.
For the Safety Run-in Period (Part A), the SMC will regularly review the safety of participants 
enrolled in this study (at least after each applicable dose level) and will decide on relevant DLTsbased on criteria defined in this protocol and by [CONTACT_838522]-escalation, or suspension of 
enrollment and/or recommendation of the safe dose of M6620 in combination with carboplatin and avelumab.
In the absence of prior human experience with the triplet combination investigated here, a 
conservative approach (i.e., toxicities are assessed as related to combination treatment unless the opposite is proven) will be adopted in ascribing the relevance of the treatment-related toxicity to study interventions (carboplatin, M6620, avelumab ). Treatment-related AEs will be ascribed as 
related to the individual study interventions or their combination, except where a clear relationship to the underlying disease or recognized co-morbidities is evident.
The SMC decision to de-escalate to the next dose level w ill be guided by [CONTACT_729116]:
!Assessment of individual DLTs according to criteria o utlined in Section 6.6.1.
!If [ADDRESS_1164831] 3 participants of  the Safety Run-in cohort, an additiona l 
3 participants will be enrolled and treated.
!At any time if ≥2 DLTs are observed, treatment with  the corresponding dose will be stoppe d 
and the next dose level will be considered as shown in  the Part A Schema (Section  1.2).
!Should a M6620 dose lower than 40 mg/m
2be requi red or at any other time, the SMC ma y 
recommend another dose level or to stop the study.
The specific working procedures will be described in an SMC Charter, which will be established 
prior to the start of recruitment.
For Part B, a data monitoring committee (DMC) will be constituted by [CONTACT_838523] B of the study to ensure  safety of the participants as well validity and 
integrity of the study. The participants, data reporting details and specific working procedures will be defined in the DMC charter prior to start of enrollment in Part B.

84/1378.3.1 Time Period and Frequency for Collecting Adverse Event and 
Serious Adverse Event Information
The AE reporting period for safety surveillance begins when the participant is initially included in 
the study (date of first signature [CONTACT_43998]/date of first signature [CONTACT_108166]) and continues until the 90-day Safety Follow-up Phone Call.
After the 30-day Safety Follow-up Visit, all SAEs, AESIs, and treatment-related nonserious AEs 
need to be documented until the 90-day Safety Fo llow-up Phone Call. Participants with an ongoing 
SAE at the 90-day Safety Follow-up Phone Call must be followed by [CONTACT_108100], unless the participant is documented as “lost to follow-up.” 
Any SAE assessed as related to study intervention mu st be recorded and reported, as indicated in 
Appendix 8,  whenever it occurs, irrespective of the time elapsed since the last administration of 
study interventions.
The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of AEs (including SAEs) and the 
procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports are in  Appendix 8.
8.3.2 Method of Detecting Adverse Events and Serious Adverse 
Events
At each study visit, the participant will be quer ied on changes in his or her condition. During the 
reporting period, any unfavorable changes in the pa rticipant’s condition will be recorded as AEs, 
regardless if reported by [CONTACT_108101].
Complete, accurate and consistent data on all AEs experienced for the duration of the reporting 
period (defined below) will be reported on an ongoing basis in the appropriate section of the eCRF. 
All SAEs must be additionally documented and reported using the appropriate SAE Report Form as specified in  Appendix 8.
8.3.3 Follow-up of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events
AEs are recorded and assessed continuously throughout the study, as specified  in Section 8.3.1
(Time Period and Frequency for Collecting Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event 
Information) and are assessed for their outcome at the 30-day Safety Follow-up Visit and 90-day 
Safety Follow-up Phone Call. All SAEs (related and unrelated to study interven tion), nonserious 
AEs classified as related to interventions by [CONTACT_737], and AESIs that are ongoing at the 90-day Safety Follow-up Phone Call must be monitored and followed up by [CONTACT_108100], unless the participant is documented as “lost to follow-up.” Reasonable attempts to obtain this information must be made and documented. 
It is also the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure that any necessary additional therapeutic 
measures and follow-up procedures are performed. Further information on follow-up procedures is given in Appendix 8.

85/1378.3.3.1 Monitoring of Specific Adverse Events
Infusion-related reactions, including drug hypers ensitivity reactions and immune-related adverse 
reaction(s) (immune-related pneumonitis, immune -related colitis, immune-related hepatitis), 
immune-related endocrinopathies (thyroid disorders, adrenal insufficiency, new-onset type I diabetes mellitus, pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117] d isorders), immune-related nephritis and renal dysfunction, and other 
irAEs (myositis, myocarditis , Guillain-Barré syndrome, uveitis) have been identified as AESIs for 
avelumab (see Section 6.11 andAppendix 6) .
Any AE that is suspected to be a potential immune-related adverse reaction or infusion-related 
reaction will be considered an AESI. These AESIs do not require expedited reporting unless they are serious. Should the AESI be serious, an SAE Report Form should be completed, and the reporting process for SAEs should be followed.
8.3.[ADDRESS_1164832] comply with any applicable site-specific requirements related to the 
reporting of SAEs (particularly deaths) involving study participants to the Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)/Institutional Review Board (IRB) that approved the study.
In accordance with International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) Good Clinical Practice (GCP), 
the Sponsor/designee will inform the Investigator of findings that could adversely affect the safety 
of participants, impact the conduct of the study or alter the IEC’s/IRB’s approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_43932]. In line with respective regulations, the Sponsor/designee will inform the Investigator of AEs that are both serious and unexpected and considered to be related to the administered product (“suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions” or S[LOCATION_003]Rs). The Investigator should place copi[INVESTIGATOR_43933]. National regulations regarding Safety Report notifications to Investigators will be considered.
When specifically required by [CONTACT_43973], the Sponsor/designee will provide 
appropriate Safety Reports directly to the concerned lead IEC/IRB and will maintain records of these notifications. When direct reporting is not clearly defined by [CONTACT_108103]-specific regulations, the Investigator will be responsible for promptly notifying the concerned IEC/IRB of 
any Safety Reports provided by [CONTACT_1034]/designee and of filing copi[INVESTIGATOR_43934].
For studies covered by [CONTACT_43975] 2001/20/EC, the Sponsor’s responsibilities

on Reporting Serious Adverse Events, Adverse Events of Special Intere st, and DLTs.
Investigators must actively follow-up, document, and report on th e outcome of all these 
pregnancies, even if the participants are withdrawn from the study.
The Investigator must notify the Sponsor/designee of these outcomes us ing the Pregnancy Report 
Form. If an abnormal outcome occurs, the SAE Report Form will be used  if the participant sustains 
an event and the Parent-Child/Fetus Adverse Event Report Form if t he child/fetus sustains an 
event. Any abnormal outcome (e.g., spontaneous abortion, fetal de ath, stillbirth, congenital 
anomalies, ectopic pregnancy) must be reported in an expedited manner, as specified in 
Section 8.3.1,  while normal outcomes must be reported within [ADDRESS_1164833] be 
discontinued from study intervention. The Sponsor/designee must be n otified without delay and 
the participant must be followed as indicated above.
8.4 Treatment of Overdose
For this study, any dose of avelumab greater than 10% above the planned dose for a particular administration will be considered an overdose.
For this study, any dose of M6620 greater than 10% above the dose identified in Part A (starting 
with RP2D of the doublet [90 mg/m
2]) within a 24-hour time period will be considered an 
overdose.
For this study, any dose of carboplatin greater th an 10% above the planned dose for a particular 
administration within a 24-hour time period will be considered an overdose.
For this study, any dose of SoC chemotherapy greater than 10% above the planned dose for a 
particular administration within a 24-hour time period will be considered an overdose.
Even if it is not associated with an AE or a SAE, any overdose is recorded in the eCRF and reported 
to the Sponsor’s Global Patient Safety Department in an expedited manner. Overdoses are reported on a SAE Report Form, following the procedure in Appendix 8,  section on Reporting Serious 
Adverse Events, Adverse Events of Special Interest, and DLTs.

8.5 Pharmacokinetics
The following PK parameters will be calculated for M6620, when appropriate (Table 13) .
Table 13 Pharmacokinetics Parameters
Symbol Definition
AUC 0-t The area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) from time zero (= dosing time) to the last 
sampling time (t last) at which the concentration is at or above the lower limit of quantification. 
Calculated using the mixed log linear trapezoidal rule (linear up, log down).
AUC 0-∞ The AUC from time zero (dosing time) extrapolated to infinity, based on the predicted value for the 
concentration at t last,as estimated using the linear regression from λzdetermination. 
AUC 0-∞=AUC 0-t+Clast pred / λz
AUCτ The area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) over the dosing interval from T 1=0 h to T 2=τ h. 
Calculated using the mixed log linear trapezoidal rule (linear up, log down). For single dose, AUC τ 
is calculated as a partial area with the defined time range. In multiple dose profiles AUC ∃is 
calculated at steady state from 1 predose time point to the dosing interval time. In cases where the 
actual observation time is not equal to the scheduled observation time AUC ∃will be calculated 
based on the estimated concentration at τ hours, and not the concentration at the actual 
observation time.
λz Terminal first order (elimination) rate constant. Determined from the terminal slope of the 
log-transformed concentration curve using linear regression on terminal data points of the curve
Cmax Maximum observed concentration
Cmin Minimum observed concentration during a complete dosing interval
tmax The time to reach the maximum observed concentration collected during a dosing interval (unless otherwise defined, take the 1
stoccurrence in case of multiple/identical C maxvalues)
t1/2 Apparent terminal half-life. t 1/2  = ln (2)/λz
!Pharmacokinetics of avelumab for all the participants will be assessed using a sparse sampling 
approach. Serum concentrations from sparse PK sampling for avelumab will allow population 
PK analyses. The population PK report will be a separate document and will not be included in the clinical study report (CSR).
!Whole blood samples of approximately 2 mL will be collected for mea surement of plasma 
concentrations of M6620, as specified in the S oA (Section 1.3). The a ctual date and time 
(24-hour clock time) of each sample will be reco rded.
!The quantification of M6620 in plasma will be p erformed using a validate d analytical method. 
Concentrations will be used to evaluate the PK of M6620. The M6620 p lasma samples may 
also be used for evaluations of metabolites of M6 620, for further evaluation  of the bioanalytical 
method, and for analyses that provide informa tion on the metabolic pa thways used by [CONTACT_838525] M6620.

96/1379.1 Statistical Hypotheses
No formal statistical hypothesis will be tested, as the study is designed to be exploratory.
9.2 Sample Size Determination
Part A
During Part A of the study, approximately 3 to 18 participants are expected to be enrolled to 
evaluate the safe dose for the triplet combination (modified 3 + 3 design, but only dose reductions will be considered if necessary). 
Part B
After confirmation of the safe target dose, approxima tely 72 participants will be randomly assigned 
to 1 of 2 treatment groups in Part B of the study (36 participants per arm; 1:1 randomization,stratified by [CONTACT_838495]). The median time for PFS in participants who have received treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy after failure to PARPi [INVESTIGATOR_838467] 6 months (Ang 2013) , depending on prior lines of treatment and 
platinum-free interval.
A sample size of 36 participants in each treatment group is chosen based on the following 
assumptions: Based on [ADDRESS_1164836] ratio (HR) of 0.6 or lower is 74% under the assumption of a true HR of 0.5; whereas, if the true HR is 0.75 (a nonrelevant effect regarding further development of this combination therapy for such an indication), the probability to observe a HR of 0.6 or lower is 21.5%, and if there is no effect (i.e.,if the true HR = 1), the probability for an observed HR of 0.6 is 3.5%.
It is assumed that the accrual period will be approximately 12 months, followed by a follow-up 
period of 15 months (assuming median PFS time of 12 months in the triplet combination arm and 6 months in the SoC arm). The predicted drop-out rate (participants without any information about 
PFS event) is 10% in total.
9.3 Populations for Analyses
The analysis populations are specified in Table 16. The final decision to exclude participants from 
any analysis population will be made during a blinded data review meeting prior to database lock.

There is no formal significance level for this study, and all analyses are considered descriptive.
In general, continuous variables will be summarized using number of participants (n); mean, 
standard deviation; median; 25thpercentile to 75thpercentile (Q1 to Q3); minimum; and maximum. 
If there are fewer than [ADDRESS_1164838] study intervention administration will be used as the baseline measurement with the exception of pre-randomization assessments used for the derivation of efficacy endpoints (e.g., tumor assessment at Baseline, which will be set to missing, if not done prior to randomization).
The last available assessment prior to the start of study intervention is defined as “baseline” value 
or “baseline” assessment for safety.
On Treatment
The on-treatment period is defined as the time from  the first dose of st udy inte rvention through 
minimum (30 days + last dose of study intervention, start day of new anticancer therapy – 1 day), unless otherwise stated.
9.4.1 Efficacy Analyses
Analysis of Primary Endpoint (Part B: Randomized-controlled Period)
The PFS time is defined as the time (in months) from the date of randomization to the date of the 
first documentation of objective PD as per RECIST v1.1, as assessed by [CONTACT_737], or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first.
The HR (including 95% confidence interval) will be calculated by [CONTACT_44711]’s proportional hazards 
model (Table 17) . A stratified analysis by [CONTACT_838526]. The Full Analysis Set will be used for all efficacy analysesin Part B.

100/1379.4.2.1 Adverse Events
All AEs will be coded according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). 
Severity of AEs will be graded using the NCI-CTCAE toxicity grading scale. 
Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) are defi ned as events with onset dates occurring on 
treatment, or events which worsen on-treatment (see Appendix 8,  Adverse Events: Definitions and 
Procedures for Recording, Evaluating, Follow-up, and Reporting).
The frequency of participants experiencing TEAEs, regardless of relatedness to study 
interventions, will be summarized by [CONTACT_838527]. Similar summaries will also be provided for serious TEAEs, TEAEs leading to permanent discontinuation of study interventions, TEAEs by [CONTACT_764], TEAEs related to study intervention, TEAEs with fatal outcome, and treatment-emergent AESIs, such as irAEs. A listing of AEs meeting DLT definition will be provided. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Laboratory Values 
Laboratory results will be classified by [CONTACT_64922] e according to NCI-CTCAE. The worst on-treatment 
grades for chemistry and hematology laboratory results will be summarized. Shifts in toxicity grading from Baseline to highest grade during the on-treatment period will be displayed. For laboratory tests without an NCI-CTCAE grade definition, results will be presented categorically (e.g., below, within, or above normal limits). 
9.4.3 Other Analyses
[IP_ADDRESS] Baseline Characteristics
Analyses of participant disposition, treatment/study discontinuations, demographics, and other 
baseline characteristics will be described in the IAP. 
PK, immunogenicity, PD, and biomarker exploratory analyses will be specified in the Integrated 
Analysis Plan finalized before database lock. In tegrated analyses across studies, such as the 
population PK analysis and pharmacodynamic analyses will be presented separately from the main clinical study report (CSR).
[IP_ADDRESS] Estimation of Individual PK Parameters
Pharmacokinetic parameters for M6620 will be calculated by [CONTACT_36532]/  Data Processing Group of QPD, [COMPANY_006], Darmstadt, [LOCATION_013], or by a CRO selected by [CONTACT_1034], using standard noncompartmental methods and the actual administered dose. Pharmacokinetic parameters will be calculated using the actual elapsed time since dosing, given with a precision of 14 significant digits or the Statistical Analysis System (SAS®) format Best12. When the actual sampling time is missing, calculations will be performed using the scheduled time. Otherwise, there will be no 
further imputation of missing data.

avelumab for all participants will be assessed using a sparse sampling approach . Plasma 
concentrations from sparse PK sampling for avelumab will allow population PK anal yses. The 
population PK r eport will be a separate document and not be included in the CSR.
Pharmacokineti c concentrations below the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) are tak en as zero 
for descriptive s tatistics for M6620 and avelumab. M6620 PK concentrations below LLO Q, which 
are before the l ast quantifiable data point, will be taken as zero for calculating the AUC . The PK 
parameters wil l be summarized using descriptive statistics. Individual as well as mean

116/137Appendix 3 Contraception
Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP)
A woman is of childbearing potential (i.e., fertile), following menarche and until either:
1) becoming postmenopausal; or,2) is permanently sterile by [CONTACT_3553] a hysterectomy, bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_233041].
Postmenopausal is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. A 
high follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy. However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient.
Highly Effective Contraceptive Methods
Highly effective methods are those with a fail ure rate of less than 1% per year when used 
consistently and correctly.
These methods are further classified into user-independent and user-dependent methods.
Because user-independent methods do not depend on the participant’s ability to use them consistently and correctly, they are preferred when contraception is introduced as a condition for study participation.
Caution should be taken for hormonal contraception, as it may be susceptible to interaction with 
the study intervention(s), which may reduce the efficacy of the contraception method. In this case, a second highly effective method of contraception should be used during the treatment period and for at least [ADDRESS_1164848] dose of maintenance with avelumab or bevacizumab, whichever is later.
User-Dependent
!Combined (estrogen- and progestogen-containing) hormonal contraception associated with 
inhibition of ovulation
!Oral
!Intravaginal
!Transdermal
!Progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation
!Oral

User-Independent

!Intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS)
!Bilateral tubal occlusion
!Vasectomized partner: This is a highly effective contraception method only if the partner is 
the sole sexual partner of the WOCBP and he has received medical assessment of the surgical 
success.
!Sexual abstinence: This is a highly effective method only if the WOCBP refrains from 
heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study 
intervention. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant.
Acceptable Contraceptive Method
Allowed only under certain situations, as specified in the Clinical Trial Facilitation Group 
recommendations, because they have a failure rate of more than 1% per year and therefore are 
not considered to be highly effective methods.
!Progestogen-only oral hormonal contraception, where inhibition of ovulation is not the 
primary mode of action
!Male or female condom with or without spermicide

Carboplatin dose (mg) = Target area under the curve (AUC mg ∙min/mL) x (GFR* + 25)
*GFR (glomerular filtration rate) estimated by [CONTACT_3533] (CrCl) using Cockcroft-Gault Equation (see below).

CrCl male;mL
min =(140 – age )x(weight in kg )
72 x serum creatinine  mg
dL ; CrCl (female) = 0.85 x CrCl (male)
Maximum Carboplatin Dose Calculation
Consider cappi[INVESTIGATOR_109777] (AUC) to avoid potential toxicity 
due to overdosing. The maximum dose is base d on a GFR estimate that is capped at 125 mL/min 
for patients with normal renal function.
Based on target AUC (mg min/mL), the maximum dose can be calculated according to the Calvert 
formula as:
Maximum carboplatin dose (mg) = Target AUC (mg ∙min/mL) x (125 mL/min + 25)
For a target AUC = 5, the maximum dose is 5 x 150 = 750 mg
Additional Considerations
!Overweight or obese patients (BMI ≥25 kg/m2): Consider using an adjusted body weight.
Adjusted body weight (kg) = 
ideal body weight (IBW) + 0.4 x (total body weight [TBW] – IBW)
!Patients with abnormally low serum creatinine (Cr), including elderly or cachectic patients: 
Consider using a minimum Cr of 0.7 mg/dL to avoid overestimation of CrCl.

128/137Appendix 8 Adverse Events: Definitions and Procedures for Recording, 
Evaluating, Follow-up, and Reporting
Definitions
Adverse Event
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product, 
regardless of causal relationship with this treatment.  Therefore, an AE can be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, regardless if it is considered related to the medicinal product.
For surgical or diagnostic procedures, the condition/illness leading to such a procedure is 
considered as the AE rather than the procedure itself.
The Investigator is required to grade the severity or toxicity of each AE.Investigators will reference the NCI-CTCAE, version 5.0 (publication date: 27 November 2017), 
a descriptive terminology that can be used for AE reporting.
A general grading (severity/intensity; hereafter referred to as severity) scale is provided at the 
beginning of the above referenced document, and specific event grades are also provided.
If the severity for an AE is not specifically grad ed by [CONTACT_12134]-CTCAE, the Investigator is to use the 
general NCI-CTCAE definitions of Grade [ADDRESS_1164855] medical judgment.
The 5 general grades are:
!Grade 1 or Mild
!Grade 2 or Moderate
!Grade 3 or Severe 
!Grade 4 or Life-threatening 
!Grade [ADDRESS_1164856] also be reported as an SAE. However, a 
laboratory abnormality of Grade 4, such as anemia or ne utropenia, is considered serious only if the 
condition meets one of the serious criteria specified below.
If death occurs, the primary cause of death or event leading to death should be recorded and 
reported as an SAE. “Fatal” will be recorded as the outcome of this specific event and death will not be recorded as separate event. Only, if no cause of death can be reported (e.g., sudden death, unexplained death), the death per se might then be reported as an SAE.

CCI
Avelumab + M6620 Phase Ib/II Study of Carboplatin + M6620 + Avelumab in PARPi-resistant 
MS201943-0029 Ovarian Cancer
129/137Investigators must also systematically assess the causal relationship of AEs to study intervention 
(including any other nonstudy interventions, radiation therapy, etc.) using the following definitions. Decisive factors for the assessment of causal relationship of an AE to the study interventions include, but may not be limited to, temporal relationship between the AE and the study interventions, known side effects of study interventions, medical history, concomitant medication, course of the underlying disease, and study procedures.
Unrelated: Not reasonably related to the study intervention. The AE could not medically 
(pharmacologically/clinically) be attributed to the study intervention under study in this clinical study protocol. A reasonable alternative explanation must be available.
Related: Reasonably related to the study intervention. The AE could medically 
(pharmacologically/clinically) be attributed to the study intervention under study in this clinical study protocol. 
Abnormal Laboratory Findings and Other Abnormal Investigational Findings
Abnormal laboratory findings and other abnormal investigational findings (e.g., on an ECG trace) 
should not be reported as AEs unless they are associated with clinical signs and symptoms, lead to study intervention discontinuation or are considered otherwise medically important by [CONTACT_737]. If a laboratory abnormality fulfills these criteria, the identified medical condition (e.g., anemia or increased ALT) must be reported as the AE rather than the abnormal value itself.
Serious Adverse Events
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:
!Results in death
!Is life-threatening. Life-threatening refers to an ev ent in which the participant is at risk of death 
at the time of the event, not an event that hypot hetically might have caused death if it was more 
severe.
!Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_43928]
!Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity
!Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect
!Is otherwise considered to be medically important. Important medical events that may not result 
in death, be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_838490], based 
upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.
For the purposes of reporting, any suspected transmission of an infectious agent via a study 
intervention is also considered an SAE, as specified below for reporting SAEs, AESIs, and DLTs.

Avelumab + M6620 Phase Ib/II Study of Carboplatin + M6620 + Avelumab in PARPi-resistant 
MS201943-0029 Ovarian Cancer
130/137Events that Do Not Meet the Definition of an SAE
Elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_43930], or to simplify study intervention or procedures (e.g., an 
overnight stay to facilitate chemotherapy and related hydration therapy application) are not considered SAEs. However, all events leading to unplanned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_43931] (i.e., undesirable effects of any administered treatment) must be documented and reported as SAEs.
Events Not to Be Considered as AEs/SAEs
Medical conditions present at the initial study visit that do not worsen in severity or frequency 
during the study are defined as Baseline Medical Conditions and are not to be considered AEs.
AE/SAEs Observed in Association with Disease Progression
Progression of the disease/disorder being studied assessed by [CONTACT_838534] (including 
laboratory abnormalities) s hould not be reported as an (S)AE, unless th e participant’s general 
condition is more severe th an expected for the participant’s condition and /or unless the outcome 
is fatal within the AE repor ting period, as defined in Section  8.3.2 (Method  of Detecting Adverse 
Events and Serious Adverse  Events).
Adverse Events of Special  Interest for Safety Monitoring
Any AE that is suspected to  be a potential irAE or an infusion-related reac tion will be considered 
an AESI.
Other Adverse Events to b e Reported Following a Specialized Procedu re 
Dose-limiting toxicities are defined in Section 6.6.1.
Recording and Follow-Up  of AE and/or SAE
It is important that each A E report include a description of the event, i ts duration (onset and 
resolution dates and also on set and resolution times, when it is important to  assess the time of AE 
onset relative to the recor ded study intervention administration time), its severity, its causal 
relationship with the study intervention, any other potential causal factors, any treatment given or other action taken, including dose modification or discontinuation of the study intervention, and its outcome. In addition, serious cases should be identified, and the appropriate seriousness criteria documented. If an AE constitutes a DLT, this is documented accordingly.
Specific guidance is in the eCRF Completion and Monitoring Conventions provided by [CONTACT_429].

131/137Reporting Serious Adverse Events, Adverse Events of Special Interest, and Dose-limiting 
Toxicities
Serious Adverse Events
In the event of any new SAE occurring during the reporting period, the Investigator must 
immediately (within a maximum of 24 HOURS after becoming aware of the event) inform the Sponsor or its designee using the SAE Report Form in the eCRF following specific completion instructions.
Reporting of SAEs via paper report form is required as a back-up method only in the case of 
electronic data capture (EDC) failure. Names, addresses, and telephone and fax numbers will be included on the paper report form. All information reported via paper form must be transcribed into the eCRF as soon as the system becomes available.
In exceptional circumstances, an SAE (or follow-up information) may be reported by [CONTACT_756]; 
in these cases, an SAE Report Form must be completed immediately thereafter in the eCRF. 
Relevant pages from the eCRF may be provided in parallel (e.g., medical history, concomitant 
drugs). Additional documents may be provided by [CONTACT_737], if available (e.g., laboratory results, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27450], autopsy report).
The Investigator must respond to any reque st for follow-up information (e.g., additional 
information, outcome, final evaluation, other records where needed) or to any question the Sponsor/designee may have on the AE within the same timelines as those noted above for initial reports. This is necessary to ensure prompt assessment of the event by [CONTACT_43971] (as applicable) to allow the Sponsor to meet strict regulatory timelines associated with expedited safety reporting obligations.
Requests for follow-up will usually be made via the responsible Monitor, although in exceptional 
circumstances the drug safety department may c ontact the Investigator directly to obtain further 
information or to discuss the event.
Adverse Events of Special Interest
Serious AESIs must be reported in an expedited manner as SAEs as outlined above. Nonserious 
AESI are not required to be reported in an expedited manner.
Reporting of nonserious AESIs via paper report form is required as a back-up method only in the 
case of EDC failure. Names, addresses, and telephone and fax numbers will be included on the paper report form. All information reported via paper form must be transcribed into the eCRF as soon as the system becomes available.

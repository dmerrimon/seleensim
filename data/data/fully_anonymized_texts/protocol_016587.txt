Purpose  
The purpose of this study to explore the wear experience in Dailies TOTAL1 Multifocal® contact [CONTACT_13276]  
(Alcon, Fort Worth, TX, [LOCATION_003]) in  presby[CONTACT_265687].  
Study Overview  
This open -label study is of presby[CONTACT_265688]. Participants 
whose habitual vision correction device is spectacles will be fit into Dailies TOTAL1 Multifocal®  contact 
[CONTACT_13276] . Participants will be assessed after 1 week of wear at a follow -up visit (Visit 2) to confirm a 
successful contact [CONTACT_224097]. Refitting will occur if necessary . Participants will return for a final visit  after [ADDRESS_323125] lenses are used by [CONTACT_159641] 40.9 million adults in the [LOCATION_002]. [1]  
Contact [CONTACT_265689], and risks to 
wearers are minimized by [CONTACT_265690].  Daily disposable contact [CONTACT_265691], which reduces  the required amount of time to care for contact 
[CONTACT_13276].  In addition, daily disposable contact [CONTACT_265692], which 
decreases associated comfort issues in lens wearers, including decreasing the risk of triggering Giant 
papi[INVESTIGATOR_145902] (GPC) and/or ocular allergic responses in patients. [2]  Additionally, daily 
disposable contact [CONTACT_265693].   This is reflected in a study which found 
less superficial punctate staining and symptoms of dryness when comparing daily disposable contact 
[CONTACT_265694]. [3]  
Global contact [CONTACT_265695] [ADDRESS_323126] 
lens wearers was 30.8 ± 13.9 years for males and 32.5 ± 14.3 years for females . Trend analysis for that 
IRB Approved: 18 October 2023  
Version: 2.[ADDRESS_323127] lens wearing presby[CONTACT_35562] .[4] The increasing age of lens wearers and 
the limited provision of corrections indicate an unmet need. In addition, many i ndividuals discontinue 
contact [CONTACT_265696]. [5] Reasons for this include  
dissatisfaction with  comfort and/or vis ion[5].  
Purpose  
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the wear experience of people with presby[CONTACT_265697] a Delefilcon A soft lens multifocal lens (Dailies TOTAL1 
Multifocal, Alcon, Ft. Worth TX [LOCATION_003]).  We expect t o enroll a relatively equal amount of former soft 
multifocal contact [CONTACT_265698].  
Key Endpoints  
1. Visual Analog Scale survey of lens wear symptoms (comfort, drynes s, vision) with contact [CONTACT_13276]  
2. Assessment of the participant’s quality of life with the Dailies TOTAL1 Multifocal®  contact [CONTACT_265699] [ADDRESS_323128] lens fitting will be com pleted  to 
fit the participants in Dailies TOTAL1 Multifocal ® contact [CONTACT_13276] . The initial contact [CONTACT_265700]’s fitting guide , and all subsequent changes will follow this guide,  
which is included in the appendix.   
Visit 2 will occur 1 week ( ±3 days)  after visit 1. Participants will return to the study site wearing the 
study provided contact [CONTACT_265701]. Contact [CONTACT_265702]. If a refit is needed, an additional Visit 2 will be scheduled. This may be repeated until satisfactory fit is achieved.  
Visit 3 will occur 1 month (±3 days) after the follow -up visit. Participants will return to the study site 
wearing the study provided contact [CONTACT_265701]. Contact [CONTACT_265703]. The participants will complete the Overall Wear Experience Survey .  
Surveys  (which will be deployed in REDCap) will include:  
Overall Wear Experience Survey  
0-100 Scale:  
• Quality of vision while watching television  
• Quality of vision while using a smart  phone

Recruitment  
Potential subjects may see posters placed on bulletin boards at The Ohio State University (OSU) or local 
eye care offices, emails to students, faculty and staff at OSU, online or paper ads, signs on the OSU buses,  
StudySearch,  The College of Optometry website and the Innovation in Vision  and Eye C are Research Group  
(iVERG ) website.  A search of the electronic medical records of The Ohio State College of Optometry may 
be done to identify possible subjects who may be contact[CONTACT_265706]. A search of The OSU College of Optometry Research Database ( 2017H0032 ) will also be 
completed. Word of mouth referrals by [CONTACT_20936].  
Emails to alumni of the OSU College of Optometry may be sent for local doctors to notify eligible potential 
subjects abou t the study.  
 
Inclusion criteria:  
1. Ability to give informed consent.  
2. Any gender.

Consent and Confidentiality  
IRB Approved: 18 October 2023  
Version: 2.[ADDRESS_323131]’s ability to consent to the study, the subject will be excluded from the study. If the subject agrees to take part in the s creening or measurement, he or she 
will sign and date the most recent IRB -stamped consent as will the team member. The subject will be 
provided wi th a copy of the consent form. The investigator team is trained in privacy issues and will be 
reminded of the importance of patient privacy prior to study initiation. Potential study participants will contact [CONTACT_20940], emails or hearing about the study by [CONTACT_265708] m outh, giving them 
the choice of whether or not they wish to participate in a st udy for people with presby[CONTACT_19555] . Privacy is 
protected by [CONTACT_265709], excluding other 
personal or medical information that should be private to the patients. The PHI needed is only for the purposes of this study.  
Statistical Analysis and Power Calculation  
This monadic study will report outcomes with descriptive statistics, and as such, no power calculation is necessary. A previous multifocal study with 20 subjects was conducted recently at this site which 
successfully recruited and studied presby[CONTACT_265710].  
Data Management and Security  
During the active stages of the study (recruitment to last measurement visit), all paperwork (consents, 
questionnaires and data forms) for each subject will reside in a subject folder for easy access throughout 
the study. The folders will reside in the lim ited-access research area, in a locked file drawer or cupboard. 
At the completion of the study or disenrollment of a subject the paperwork in the subject’s folders will be 
reorganized into a regulatory binder (consents, W -9s) and a data binder (questionnai re and data forms) 
and will reside in an office in the limited -access research area. When the data analysis is completed and 
the study is considered complete, the binders will be stored in the secure Department or Office Clinical 
Research Area. Paperwork ( questionnaire and data forms) for individuals who participate in the baseline 
visit but are not eligible to continue the study will be stored in the study regulatory binder in an office in the limited -access research area. An electronic file of potential s ubjects and a file of enrolled subjects with 
their contact [CONTACT_3031], as well as electronic files of collected data with the subject number, will reside 
on a limited -access shared drive with firewall and password protection and is restricted to individuals in 
the research team. Any electronic data files that contain PHI will be destroyed at the conclusion of the 
study.  
Risks to Subjects and Mitigation 
Although rare, a subject could experience eye pain, changes in vision, continued redness or irritation of 
the eye when inserting or learning to insert a contact [CONTACT_13293]. More likely transient blurring of vision (less 
than one minute) or mild, transient (less than a minute) stinging may occur.   
Whenever wearing a contact [CONTACT_13293], the possibility of eye pain due to scratching the eye or getting an 
infection is possible, but not common.  
 Adverse Events  
IRB Approved: 18 October 2023  
Version: 2.[ADDRESS_323132]  is not 
able to stand or move freely to utilize the equipment, to name a few possible causes . These issues are 
usually revealed at the screening assessment visit. Subjects who cannot provide analyzable data will be 
dismissed f rom the study. Subjects who do not keep scheduled visits within the required time frame will 
be dismissed from the study. Study team members will make reasonable efforts to accommodate subjects’ schedules.  
Protocol Violations, Discontinuation  
In the event that a member of the study team or a representative of sponsor becomes aware of a major 
protocol violation, the IRB shall be notified within 10 working days.

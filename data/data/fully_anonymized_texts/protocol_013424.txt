schema. 
2.3. Benefit/Risk 
Assessment This section was revised as follows (bold=added text): 
Non-clinical and clinical data to date do not indicate any areas of 
medical safety concern considered related to ensifentrine treatment. 
Hypertension may be a potential risk due to incidence of  in 
both RPL554-CO-[ADDRESS_1048376] commonly reported psychiatric adverse 
reactions in the pooled 24-week safety population from the Phase III 
-related reactions were 
epression 
receiving placebo. One patient who received ensifentrine in the 
pooled 24-week safety population experienced a suicide-related 
adverse reaction (suicide attempt), and in Phase IIb study RPL554-
CO-203, one patient who received ensifentrine 1.5 mg experienced a 
suicide-related adverse reaction (suicide). A causal relationship 
between ensifentrine and increased rates of psychiatric events could 
not be established. 
In a reproductive performance study, male rats had decreased 
sperm counts in the testis were observed at all doses. The clinical 
relevance of this observation is undetermined.  
Ensifentrine has demonstrated statistically and clinically significant 
bronchodilator as well as anti-inflammatory effects in non-clinical 
models and clinical studies with the potential to treat obstructive 
and inflammatory diseases of the respi[INVESTIGATOR_4352], such as COPD, 
non-CF bronchiectasis, CF, and asthma. Ensifentrine has been 
assessed in clinical studies to date in COPD, CF, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_520162]-19, and asthmatic patients. Considering the consistent 
improvements in lung function in subjects with COPD, asthma and Change reflects 
updated 
language to 
Investigator 
Brochure. 
Protocol RPL554-CO-303   Version 4.0; [ADDRESS_1048377] 2024  
Verona Pharma plc CONFIDENTIAL Page 9 of 76 Description of Changes in Protocol Version 2.0, Amendment 1.0: 03 June 2024 
Section # and Name [CONTACT_764985], and improvements in symptoms, and health-related quality of 
life across multiple studies in subjects with COPD, and substantial 
reduction in the rate and risk of moderate/severe COPD 
exacerbations along with the overall favorable safety profile in 
studies to date, the benefit- risk profile of ensifentrine is considered 
positive.  
As always, Investigators should remain alert to the possibility of AEs 
manifesting in their patients and should handle these in accordance 
with protocol requirements. 
No significant medical risks to subjects have been identified from studies conducted thus far with ensifentrine administered in the solution 
formulation, suspension formulation, or dry powder formulation. A 
slight increase in mean heart rate (up to 12 beats per minute [bpm]) 
without reported medical significance at a 6 mg supratherapeutic doses 
has been reported in healthy volunteers (RPL554-PK-101).  In subjects 
with COPD, transient increases in peak heart rate of [ADDRESS_1048378] been observed with the 6 mg twice daily dose only over 4 weeks. 
Rare cases of suicidal ideation and behavior, including one completed 
suicide, were also observed; however, a causal relationship with 
ensifentrine could not be established. Otherwise, the non-clinical and 
clinical data to date do not indicate any areas of particular medical safety 
concern. 
Effects on reproductive performance in male rats given the highest dose 
of 15.5 mg/kg/day included lower number of pairings of dosed males 
resulting in pregnancy in undosed females, higher pre and post 
implantation loss resulting in lower mean litter size, and lower sperm 
motility and higher abnormal sperm. No ensifentrine-related adverse 
effects were observed at 5.75 mg/kg/day (20.5 times the maximum 
recommended human dose based on area under the curve [AUC]). There 
were no effects on embryo-fetal survival and development in either rats 
or rabbits in the main embryo-fetal development studies. Ensifentrine 
had no effects on fertility or reproductive performance in female rats. 
Ensifentrine has statistically and clinically significant bronchodilator as 
well as antiinflammatory effects. As such, the clinical development of 
ensifentrine is focused on the treatment of obstructive and inflammatory 
lung diseases, including COPD. Considering the consistent 
improvements in lung function, symptoms, and health-related quality of 
life across multiple studies in subjects with COPD and the overall 
favorable safety profile in studies to date, the benefit/risk profile of 
ensifentrine is considered positive.  
 
 
4.2. Justification for 
Dose The 1st and 2nd paragraphs of this section were revised to read as follows 
(bold=added text, strikethrough=deleted text): 
A 3 mg twice daily dose was selected as the Phase III dose based on data 
from two 4-week Phase IIb studies RPL554-CO-203 and RPL554-CO-
205 which show clinically meaningful and statistically significant 
improvements in pulmonary function with the 3 mg dose over the 12-
hour dosing interval, in subjects  patients with or without additional bronchodilator background therapy. Two phase III studies, RPL554-
CO-301 and RPL554-CO-302 confirmed the efficacy and safety of 3 
mg ensifentrine BID in subjects with COPD.  
 
A review of safety and tolerability across all COPD studies including 
over 24 and 48 weeks has shown a safety profile similar to placebo, even 
when added on top of other bronchodilator therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], including LAMA 
and LABA therapi[INVESTIGATOR_764935] . Updated for 
justification.

Section 2.2.3. 
Ensifentrine Ensifentrine is a novel, small molecule, and is a  potent, selective dual 
inhibitor of Phosphodiesterase 3 (PDE3) and PDE4.  This novel mechanism 
of action leads to downstream bronchodilatory and anti-inflammatory

Benefit/Risk 
Assessment Non-clinical and clinical data to date do not indicate any areas of medical 
safety concern considered related to ensifentrine treatment. Hypertension 
may be a potential risk due to incidence of hypertension adverse events  in both phase III studies , RPL554-
CO-301 and RPL554-CO-
ensifentrine and placebo groups, respectively). An increase in psychiatric 
adverse reactions were reported with use of ensifentrine. The most 
commonly reported psychiatric adverse reactions in the pooled 24-week 
safety population from the phase III3 studies were insomnia ([ADDRESS_1048390] who received ensifentrine in the pooled 24-
week safety population experienced a suicide-related adverse reaction 
(suicide attempt), and in Phase IIb study RPL554-CO-203, one subject who 
received ensifentrine 1.5 mg experienced a suicide-related adverse reaction 
(suicide). A causal relationship between ensifentrine and increased rates of 
psychiatric events could not be established.

over 12 Weeks in Subjects with Moderate to Severe COPD. 
Short Title 
Ensifentrine CAT study. 
Rationale 
Ensifentrine is a selective dual inhibitor of PDE3 and PDE4 which has demonstrated 
pronounced bronchodilation in subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD) as well as anti-inflammatory effects in healthy subjects in clinical studies. 
Ensifentrine inhalation suspension 3 mg twice daily was recently approved in the United 
States (US) for the maintenance treatment of COPD in adult patients and is marketed 
under the tradename [CONTACT_764987]™ (NDA 217389). 
The primary goals of pharmacological treatment of COPD are to reduce symptoms, 
exacerbation frequency, and exacerbation severity as well as to improve overall quality of 
life in patients with COPD.[ADDRESS_1048395] (CAT™; CAT)3–[ADDRESS_1048396] of a patient’s well-being. This study will assess the effect of 
ensifentrine on CAT scores in patients with moderate to severe COPD when added to 
standard of care in routine clinical practice. 
Objectives 
Efficacy  Primary: To assess the proportion of responders to treatment with ensifentrine 
based on the improvement in individual CAT scores when added to standard of 
care in symptomatic subjects with moderate to severe COPD in routine clinical 
practice.  
 Secondary: To investigate the effects of ensifentrine on COPD symptoms, as 
measured by [CONTACT_764959].

Overall Design 
This is a Phase IIIb, single-center, open-label study investigating the effect of treatment 
with twice daily nebulized ensifentrine (3 mg) over [ADDRESS_1048398] eligibility for participation in 
the study in the following sequence: 
 CAT Training followed by [CONTACT_764960] (mMRC) 
 Collect and record demographic data 
 Eligibility review (inclusion and exclusion criteria) 
 Review and record medical, surgical, COPD and smoking history 
 Review of prior and concomitant medication  
At Visit 2, subject eligibility will be confirmed (screening tests will be verified, and it 
will be assured that the subject meets all inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria). 
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_10239], a physical examination completed, and vital signs will be 
assessed. Eligible subjects will receive a nebulizer and compressor and will be 
administered their first dose of ensifentrine (3 mg) in-clinic during training on nebulizer 
use. Adverse events will be assessed. Subjects will receive a 6-week supply of 
ensifentrine (3 mg) to be administered twice-daily (BID) with a standard jet nebulizer. 
Ensifentrine will be administered BID for a total of 12 weeks.  
Protocol RPL554-CO-303   Version 4.0; [ADDRESS_1048399] 2024  
Verona Pharma plc CONFIDENTIAL Page 19 of 76 At Visit 3 (Week 6), subjects will return and complete the CAT, their concomitant 
medication reviewed, their vital signs and safety will be assessed. Subjects will receive a 
6-week supply of ensifentrine (3 mg) administered BID.  
At Visit 4 (Week 12), subjects will complete the CAT, their concomitant medication 
reviewed, their vital signs and safety will be assessed. After 12 weeks, treatment with 
nebulized ensifentrine (3 mg) will end.  
The CAT will be completed on paper at Visits 1, [ADDRESS_1048400]’s response.  All 
questions must be answered. Answers to each question will be 
logged into the eCRF by [CONTACT_3476].  
A follow-up phone call will be made to the subject approximately one week after the end 
of treatment. 
Subjects may remain on prescribed short- and long-acting COPD medications throughout 
participation provided they are not included in the prohibited medication list. COPD 
exacerbations should be treated at physician’s discretion as per usual practice.

2.1 Study Rationale
Ensifentrine inhalation suspension 3 mg twice daily was recently approved in the United 
States (US) for the maintenance treatment of COPD in adult patients and is marketed 
under the tradename [CONTACT_764987]™ (NDA 217389, “OHTUVAYRE”).  
The COPD Assessment Test [CAT™; CAT]3–[ADDRESS_1048412] of a patient’s well-being. This study will assess the effect of 
ensifentrine on CAT scores in subjects with moderate to severe COPD when added to
standard of care in routine clinical practice.
2.[ADDRESS_1048413], acute exacerbations primarily caused by 
[CONTACT_760356]/or bacterial infections, airway remodeling, and excessive mucus production are 
believed to contribute to the airflow obstruction and lung parenchymal destruction. COPD 
is predicted to be the third leading cause of death and fourth most common cause of 
disability worldwide by 2030, and chronic tobacco smoke exposure is believed to be a 
key etiological factor.[ADDRESS_1048414]-of-care treatments include inhaled short- 
and long-acting bronchodilators (i.e., muscarinic antagonists [LAMA] and 2agonists
[LABA]) and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are utilized to manage symptoms of COPD.[ADDRESS_1048415]™ (CAT™)
Tools to assess if treatment goals are attained include several patient-reported outcome 
questionnaires to assist in communications between the patient and physician. However, 
the uptake of these questionnaires into routine clinical practice is integral to the 
assessment of individualized treatment regimens.2 
The CAT™ (CAT) is a validated, short, simple questionnaire that permits the evaluation 
and monitoring over time of COPD disease burden in routine clinical practice. The aim of 
the CAT is to aid health status assessment and communication between the patient and 
physician.3,7 
Protocol RPL554-CO-303 Version 4.0; [ADDRESS_1048416] of COPD on the well-being and 
daily life of the patient. The ranges include 0-9 (mild impact), 10–20 (moderate impact), 
21–30 (severe impact), and 31–40 (very severe impact). There are [ADDRESS_1048417] Tight, Breathless, 
Limited Activities, Confident, Sleep and Energy.  Patients rate their experience on a 6-
point scale, ranging from 0 (no impairment) to 5 (maximum impairment).  
2.2.3 Ensifentrine 
Ensifentrine is a novel, small molecule, and is a potent, selective dual inhibitor of 
Phosphodiesterase 3 (PDE3) and PDE4. This novel mechanism of action leads to 
downstream bronchodilatory and anti-inflammatory effects, and represents an important 
potential additional treatment option for patients with moderate to severe COPD, and 
other respi[INVESTIGATOR_764939]-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (NCFBE), asthma  
and cystic fibrosis whose disease is manifest by [CONTACT_764956]/or inflammation. 
Ensifentrine inhalation suspension [ADDRESS_1048418] of care bronchodilator and anti-inflammatory therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], 
producing complementary effects in patients needing additional therapeutic options.8 
Ensifentrine has been evaluated in 22 completed clinical studies involving approximately 
3,000 subjects, of which 16 studies involving over 2,800 subjects comprise the COPD 
development program including pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, phase IIb, and 
phase III studies.  
In one Phase IIb dose-ranging study (RPL554-CO-205) where subjects were dosed with 
ensifentrine (3 mg arm n=82) or placebo (n=84) BID in addition to once-daily tiotropi[INVESTIGATOR_1890] 
(5 mg), the CAT score was assessed at baseline, following a 2-week run in on tiotropi[INVESTIGATOR_1890], 
and after 2 and 4 weeks after treatment.  Results in the 3 mg arm demonstrated a larger 
score reduction from baseline than placebo at both time points and the pattern of 
improvement in the CAT score at Weeks 2 and 4 was similar to the improvement pattern 
observed with COPD symptoms and quality of life.  
In two Phase III studies (RPL554-CO-301 [n=760] and RPL554-CO-302 [n=791]) 
ensifentrine (3 mg) treatment consistently demonstrated the bronchodilator profile of 
ensifentrine in subjects with moderate to severe COPD over 12 weeks.9  Significant 
effects were shown across all key FEV 1endpoints in both studies.  Furthermore, 
ensifentrine-treated subjects showed significant improvements in dyspnea measured via 
Transition Dyspnea Index at Weeks 6, 12 and 24 and subjects also experienced 
improvements in COPD symptoms and quality of life in both studies. Over 24 weeks of 
treatment, ensifentrine-treated subjects demonstrated a substantial reduction in the 
frequency of moderate/severe exacerbations (RPL554 CO-301:  reduction, p=0.050; 
Protocol RPL554-CO-303 Version 4.0; [ADDRESS_1048419] 2024
Verona Pharma plc CONFIDENTIAL Page 26 of 76 RPL554 CO-302: reduction, p=0.009) compared to placebo-treated subjects. There 
was also a reduction in the risk of moderate/severe exacerbations compared to placebo 
observed in both studies (RPL554 CO-301: , p=0.038; RPL554 CO-302: 
, p=0.009).9
Overall, ensifentrine was well-tolerated with a low incidence of adverse events (AEs), 
with rates generally similar to placebo (refer to the Investigator’s Brochure [IB] for 
further detail). 
2.3 Benefit/Risk Assessment 
Non-clinical and clinical data to date do not indicate any areas of medical safety concern 
considered related to ensifentrine treatment. Hypertension may be a potential risk due to  in both 
phase III studies, RPL554-CO-[ADDRESS_1048420] commonly reported psychiatric 
adverse reactions in the pooled 24-week safety population from the phase III studies were 
insomnia ([ADDRESS_1048421] who 
received ensifentrine in the pooled 24-week safety population experienced a suicide-
related adverse reaction (suicide attempt), and in Phase IIb study RPL554-CO-203, one 
subject who received ensifentrine 1.5 mg experienced a suicide-related adverse reaction 
(suicide). A causal relationship between ensifentrine and increased rates of psychiatric 
events could not be established. 
In a reproductive toxicity study, decreased sperm counts in the testis were observed in 
male rats at all doses. The clinical relevance of this observation is undetermined.  
Ensifentrine has demonstrated statistically and clinically significant bronchodilator as 
well as anti-inflammatory effects in non-clinical models and clinical studies with the 
potential to treat obstructive and inflammatory diseases of the respi[INVESTIGATOR_4352], such as 
COPD, non-CF bronchiectasis, CF, and asthma. Ensifentrine has been assessed in clinical 
studies to date in COPD, CF, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_60992]-19 and asthmatic subjects. Considering 
the consistent improvements in lung function in subjects with COPD, asthma and CF, and 
improvements in symptoms, and health-related quality of life across multiple studies in 
subjects with COPD, and substantial reduction in the rate and risk of moderate/severe 
COPD exacerbations along with the overall favorable safety profile in studies to date, the 
benefit-risk profile of ensifentrine is considered positive.  
As always, Investigators should remain alert to the possibility of AEs manifesting in their 
subjects and should handle these in accordance with protocol requirements.

Protocol RPL554-CO-303 Version 4.0; [ADDRESS_1048427]. COPD 
exacerbations should be treated at physician’s discretion as per usual practice.  
4.2 Justification for Dose 
A 3 mg twice daily dose was selected as the phase III dose for the COPD clinical trials 
based on data from two 4-week Phase IIb studies RPL554-CO-203 and RPL554-CO-205 
which showed clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvements in 
pulmonary function with the 3 mg dose over the 12-hour dosing interval, in subjects with 
or without additional bronchodilator background therapy. Two Phase III studies, RPL554-
CO-301 and RPL554-CO-302 confirmed the efficacy and safety of 3 mg ensifentrine BID 
in subjects with COPD. Ensifentrine 3 mg twice daily (OHTUVAYRE) is the approved 
dose and regimen for the maintenance treatment of COPD in adult patients 
(OHTUVAYRE Prescribing Information).

 Subjects will be asked about any adverse events per instructions in Section 8.3.2. 
8.2 Efficacy Assessment 
Planned timepoints for all efficacy assessments are provided in the SoA ( Table 1 ).
The CAT™ is a one-page, 8-item questionnaire suitable for completion by [CONTACT_764976]. When completing the questionnaire, individuals rate their 
experience on a 6-point scale, ranging from 0 (no impairment) to 5 (maximum 
impairment) with a scoring range of 0-40. Higher scores indicate greater disease impact. 
Refer to Appendix [ADDRESS_1048478]’s response.  At Visit 1, the order should be 
CAT followed by [CONTACT_764973].
All questions must be answered, and the subject should not be told their results. It is 
recommended that the questionnaire be administered at the same time of day at each visit. 
Answers to each question will be logged into the eCRF by [CONTACT_3476]. 
Adequate time must be allowed to complete all items on the questionnaire; the 
questionnaire must be reviewed for completeness and, if necessary, the subject should be 
encouraged to complete any missing items.

As stated in Section [IP_ADDRESS], medical and COPD condition(s) identified during screening 
will be documented as medical history and not as an AE unless the condition worsens 
during the study and meets the definition of an AE. 
8.4.[ADDRESS_1048481] has been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event to 
be reasonably related to the study medication or study participation, the Investigator must 
promptly notify the Sponsor.
The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of AEs and SAEs and the 
procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in Appendix 3.
8.4.2 Method of Detecting AEs and SAEs
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open-ended 
and non-leading verbal questioning of the subject is the preferred method to inquire about 
AE occurrences.
Protocol RPL554-CO-303 Version 4.0; [ADDRESS_1048482] 2024
Verona Pharma plc CONFIDENTIAL Page 51 of 76 8.4.3 Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs 
Prompt notification by [CONTACT_115007] a 
study medication under clinical investigation are met. 
The Sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and 
other regulatory agencies about the safety of a study medication under clinical 
investigation. The Sponsor will comply with country-specific regulatory requirements 
relating to safety reporting to the regulatory authority, Institutional Review Boards 
(IRB)/Independent Ethics Committees (IEC), and Investigators. 
Investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions (S[LOCATION_003]R) according to local regulatory requirements and Sponsor policy and 
forwarded to Investigators, as necessary. 
An Investigator who receives an Investigator safety report describing an SAE or other 
specific safety information (e.g., summary or listing of SAEs) from the Sponsor will 
review and then file it along with the IB and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate
according to local requirements. 
8.4.4 Follow-up of AEs and SAEs 
After the initial AE/SAE report, the Investigator is required to proactively follow each 
subject at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs will be followed until resolution, 
stabilization, the event is otherwise explained, through the follow-up contact, or the 
subject is lost to follow-up (as defined in Section 7.3).  Further information on follow-up 
of AEs and SAEs is given in Appendix [ADDRESS_1048483] dose of study medication.
If a pregnancy is reported, the Investigator should inform the Sponsor within 24 hours of 
learning of the pregnancy and should follow the procedures outlined in Appendix 4 .
Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (e.g., spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, 
congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy) are considered SAEs. 
8.4.[ADDRESS_1048484] not been identified for ensifentrine. 
8.4.7 Disease-related Events and/or Disease-related Outcomes Not 
Qualifying as AEs or SAEs 
Disease-related events and/or disease-related outcomes should generally not be recorded 
or reported as an adverse event.  
Protocol RPL554-CO-303 Version 4.0; [ADDRESS_1048485] in an unusual or uncharacteristic manner. COPD exacerbations including daily 
expected COPD symptoms (e.g., dyspnea, chest tightness, wheezing, cough, sputum, that 
are not associated with the dosing event) will not be collected as an AE unless they meet 
the definition of an SAE. 
8.4.8 Device Incidents 
The Investigator, or responsible person according to local requirements (e.g., the head of 
the medical institution), will comply with the applicable local regulatory requirements 
relating to the reporting of device incidents to the IRB/IEC, device manufacturer, or 
regulatory authorities, as required. 
A device incident is defined as an incident related to the failure of a medical device, 
deterioration in its effectiveness, or inadequacy in its labeling or directions that led to the 
death or serious deterioration in health of a subject, user, or other person, or could do so 
were it to recur. 
8.5 Treatment of Overdose 
An overdose is defined as a dose greater than the total daily doses prescribed in this study 
which results in clinical signs and symptoms. These should be recorded by [CONTACT_523070]/SAE pages. 
In the event of an overdose the investigator should use clinical judgement in treating the 
overdose and contact [CONTACT_40862]. Verona Pharma is not recommending 
specific treatment guidance for overdose and toxicity management.

Verona Pharma plc CONFIDENTIAL Page 64 of 76 Source Documents
The Investigator/institution should maintain adequate and accurate source documents and study 
records that include all pertinent observations on each of the study center’s subjects. Source data 
should be attributable, legible, contemporaneous, original, accurate, and complete. Changes to 
source data should be traceable, should not obscure the original entry, and should be explained if 
necessary (e.g., via an audit trail). 
 Source documents provide evidence for the existence of the subject and substantiate the 
integrity of the data collected. Source documents are filed at the Investigator’s study 
center. 
 Data reported on the eCRF or entered in the eCRF that are transcribed from source 
documents must be consistent with the source documents or the discrepancies must be 
explained. The Investigator may need to request previous medical records or transfer 
records, depending on the study. Also, current medical records must be available. 
 Definition of what constitutes source data can be found in ICH E6(R2) Section 1.51. 
Study and Study Center Closure 
The Sponsor reserves the right to close the study center or terminate the study at any time for any 
reason at the sole discretion of the Sponsor. Study centers will be closed upon study completion. 
A study center is considered closed when all required documents and study supplies have been 
collected and a study center closure visit has been performed. 
The Investigator may initiate study center closure at any time, provided there is reasonable cause 
and sufficient notice is given in advance of the intended termination. 
Reasons for the early closure of a study center by [CONTACT_9330]: 
 Failure of the Investigator to comply with the protocol, the requirements of the IRB/IEC 
or local health authorities, the Sponsor’s procedures, or GCP guidelines. 
 Inadequate recruitment of subjects by [CONTACT_737]. 
 Discontinuation of further study medication development.

Verona Pharma plc CONFIDENTIAL Page 65 of 76 Appendix 3  Adverse Events: Definitions and Procedures 
for Recording, Evaluating, Follow-up and Reporting 
Definition of AE 
 An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or subject, temporally associated 
with the use of study medication, whether or not considered related to the study 
medication. 
 NOTE: An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally 
associated with the use of study medication. 
Events Meeting the AE Definition 
 Any abnormal laboratory test results (e.g., hematology, clinical chemistry) or other safety 
assessments (e.g., ECG, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), including those 
that worsen from baseline, considered clinically significant in the medical and scientific 
judgment of the Investigator (i.e., not related to progression of underlying disease). 
 Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition. 
 New conditions detected or diagnosed after study medication administration even though 
it may have been present before the start of the study. 
 Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug-drug interaction. 
 Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study 
medication or a concomitant medication. Overdose per se will not be reported as an 
AE/SAE unless it is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self-harming 
intent. Such overdoses should be reported regardless of sequelae. 
“Lack of efficacy” or “failure of expected pharmacological action” per se will not be 
reported as an AE or SAE. Such instances will be captured in the efficacy assessments. 
However, the signs, symptoms and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy 
will be reported as an AE or SAE if they fulfil the definition of an AE or SAE. 
Events NOT Meeting the AE Definition 
 Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safety 
assessments which are associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by [CONTACT_152889]’s condition. 
 The disease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of the 
disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the subject’s 
condition. 
Protocol RPL554-CO-303 Version 4.0; [ADDRESS_1048508] 2024
Verona Pharma plc CONFIDENTIAL Page 66 of 76 Medical or surgical procedure (e.g., endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that leads 
to the procedure should be assessed using the AE/SAE definitions. 
 Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]). 
 Anticipated day-to-day fluctuations of pre-existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or 
detected at the start of the study that do not worsen.  
Definition of SAE 
If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious conditions 
are met (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1080]/symptoms of the disease under study, death due to 
progression of disease). 
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: 
a) Results in death. 
b) Is life-threatening. 
The term ‘life-threatening’ in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the 
subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, which 
hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe.  
c) Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]. 
In general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5184] (usually involving at 
least an overnight stay) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_22771]/or treatment 
that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or outpatient setting. 
Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1084]. If a complication prolongs 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9236], the event is serious. When in doubt as to 
whether “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious. 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a pre-existing condition that did not worsen from 
baseline is not considered an AE. 
d) Results in persistent disability/incapacity.  The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal 
life functions. 
 This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical 
significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and 
accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle) which may interfere with or prevent everyday life 
functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption. 
e) Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
Protocol RPL554-CO-303 Version 4.0; [ADDRESS_1048509] 2024
Verona Pharma plc CONFIDENTIAL Page 67 of 76 f) Other situations:
 Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE reporting is 
appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_681799]. These events should usually be considered 
serious. 
 Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions 
that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
Recording and Follow-up of AE and/or SAE 
AE and SAE Recording 
 When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the Investigator to review all 
documentation (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1088], laboratory reports, and diagnostics reports) 
related to the event. 
 The Investigator will then record all relevant AE/SAE information in the eCRF. Each 
event must be recorded separately. 
 It is not acceptable for the Investigator to send photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_9238]’s medical 
records to Sponsor/Sponsor’s designee in lieu of completion of the Verona Pharma 
/AE/SAE eCRF page. 
 There may be instances when copi[INVESTIGATOR_764946]/Sponsor’s designee, Health Authority, or Ethics Committee. 
In this case, all subject identifiers, with the exception of the subject/patient number, will 
be redacted on the copi[INVESTIGATOR_764947]/Sponsor’s designee. 
 The Investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, 
symptoms, and/or other clinical information. Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not the 
individual signs/symptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE. 
Assessment of Intensity  
The Investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported during the 
study and assign it to one of the following categories: 
 Mild: An event that is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423], causing minimal discomfort, and not 
interfering with everyday activities. 
 Moderate: An event that causes sufficient discomfort and interferes with normal everyday 
activities. 
Protocol RPL554-CO-303 Version 4.0; [ADDRESS_1048510] 2024
Verona Pharma plc CONFIDENTIAL Page 68 of 76 Severe: An event that prevents normal everyday activities. An AE that is assessed as 
severe should not be confused with a SAE. Severe is a category utilized for rating the 
intensity of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as severe. 
An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets at least one of the predefined outcomes as 
described in the definition of an SAE, NOT when it is rated as severe. 
Assessment of Chronicity 
 Single occasion: Single event with limited duration. 
 Intermittent: Several epi[INVESTIGATOR_523019], each of limited duration 
 Persistent: Event which remained indefinitely. 
Assessment of Causality  
The Investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between study medication and each 
occurrence of each AE/SAE. The AE must be characterized as either 1) a reasonable possibility of 
causality or 2) no reasonable possibility of causality: 
 Reasonable possibility:  There is a clear temporal relationship between the study 
intervention and the event onset; and the event is known to occur with the study 
intervention or there is a reasonable possibility that the study intervention caused the 
event. Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship 
between the study intervention and the event. 
 No reasonable possibility:  There is no evidence suggesting that the study intervention 
caused the event, there is no temporal relationship between the study intervention and 
event onset, or an alternate etiology has been established (e.g., event is consistent with 
medical history). 
All efforts should be made to classify the AE according to the above categories. 
The Investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship. 
Alternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other risk factors, as 
well as the temporal relationship of the event to study medication administration will be 
considered and investigated. 
The Investigator will also consult the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) in his/her assessment. 
For each AE/SAE, the Investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she has reviewed 
the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality. 
There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred, and the Investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to the Sponsor/Sponsor’s designee. However, it is very 
important that the Investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event before the 
initial transmission of the SAE data to the Sponsor/Sponsor’s designee. 
Protocol RPL554-CO-303 Version 4.0; [ADDRESS_1048511] 2024
Verona Pharma plc CONFIDENTIAL Page 69 of 76 The Investigator may change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_114957]-up information and 
send a SAE follow-up report with the updated causality assessment. 
The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting 
requirements. 
Action and Outcome  
 Action taken with study medication (none, study medication stopped, study medication 
temporarily interrupted) 
 Other actions (none, concomitant medication, study discontinuation, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
other) 
 The outcome and date of outcome according to the following definitions: 
- Recovered or resolved (adverse event disappeared) 
- Recovering or resolving (subject is recovering) 
- Not recovered or not resolved (adverse event remains without signs of 
improvement) 
- Recovered or resolved with sequelae (adverse event has resulted in permanent 
disability or incapacity) 
- Fatal 
- Unknown (only applicable if subject has been lost to follow-up) 
 Seriousness (yes or no) 
Follow-up of AEs and SAEs 
 The Investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by [CONTACT_429]/Sponsor’s designee to elucidate the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE as 
fully as possible. This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, 
histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals. 
 If a subject dies during participation in the study or during a recognized follow-up period, 
the Investigator will provide the Sponsor/Sponsor’s designee with a copy of any 
postmortem findings including histopathology and/or autopsy report, as applicable local 
regulatory requirements will allow.  New or updated information will be recorded in the originally completed eCRF. 
 The Investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the Sponsor/Sponsor’s Designee 
within 24 hours of receipt of the information.

not, an additional highly effective method of contraception should be used. 
Sexual abstinence
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from 
heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatment. 
The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the 
study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject.

partner who becomes pregnant while the male subject is in the study. 
After obtaining the necessary signed informed consent from the pregnant female partner directly, 
the Investigator will record pregnancy information on the appropriate form and submit it to the 
Sponsor within 24 hours of learning of the partner’s pregnancy. The female partner will also be 
followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. Information on the status of the mother and 
child will be forwarded to the Sponsor. Generally, the follow-up will be no longer than 6 to 
8 weeks following the estimated delivery date. Any termination of the pregnancy will be reported 
regardless of fetal status (presence or absence of anomalies) or indication for the procedure. 
Female subjects who become pregnant 
 The Investigator will collect pregnancy information on any female subject who becomes 
pregnant while participating in this study. Information will be recorded on the appropriate 
form and submitted to the Sponsor/Sponsor Designee within [ADDRESS_1048519]’s pregnancy. 
o The Medical Monitor contact [CONTACT_484572] 2 ( Table 7 ). 
o The primary mechanism for reporting Pregnancy to the Sponsor/Sponsor’s designee will

o The Pregnancy reporting form should be sent by [CONTACT_764983].  As an alternative, the completed form can be scanned and sent as an 
attachment via email to: [EMAIL_14606].    Any female subject who becomes pregnant while participating in the study will discontinue 
study medication. The subject will be approached and asked to consent to being followed to 
determine the outcome of the pregnancy. The Investigator will collect follow-up information 
on the subject and the neonate, and the information will be forwarded to the Sponsor. 
Generally, follow-up will be no longer than 6 to 8 weeks beyond the estimated delivery date. 
Any termination of pregnancy will be reported, regardless of fetal status (presence or absence 
of anomalies) or indication for the procedure. 
 While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any pregnancy complication or 
elective termination of a pregnancy will be reported as an AE or SAE. A spontaneous 
abortion is always considered to be an SAE and will be reported as such.  For SAE reporting, 
refer to Appendix [ADDRESS_1048520]-study pregnancy related SAE considered reasonably related to the study medication 
by [CONTACT_9341] 8.4.5 . While the

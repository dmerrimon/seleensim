Acute Treatment ofMigraine
Protocol Number:
H8H-CD-LAHL/ COL MIG -305Phase: 3 Indication: Migraine -
Acute Treatment 
Primary Objective :Toevaluate thesafetyandtolerability oflong-term intermittent useoflasmiditan
100mgandoflasmiditan 200mg,asthefirstdose and as asecond dose, for theacute treatment of
migraine.
Secondary Objectives: Toexplore thelong-term efficacy oflasmiditan 100 mgandlasmiditan 200 mg
interms ofheadache response overtime.
Additional Objectives: To compare patient reported resource utilization during the study to patient 
reported information from C OL MIG -301 or COL MIG -302 in terms of cardiovascular ev ents and in terms 
of migraine epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841].
StudyEndpoints
Primary Endpoint: Theproportion ofpatients andtheproportion ofattacks associated withanyadverse
eventandwithspecific adverse events.
Secondary Endpoint :  The proportion ofmigraine attacks treated with lasmiditan 100mgandwith
lasmiditan 200mgwhich respond at2hours , calculated foreach 3month period.
Study Design: 
This is a prospective ,randomized, open -label study in subjects with migraine who hav e completed the 
Phase 3 studies , COL MIG-301 or COL MIG -302. Subjects will be stratified (yes or no) for use of 
concomitant medications that reduce the frequency of migraine epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841].
Subjects will be asked to treat all migraine attacks with study drug on an outpatient basis for up to 
12months. Each patient’s study participation will consist of a screening visit (Visit 1) anda treatment 
period of up to [ADDRESS_551368] will treat all migraine attacks with either lasmiditan 
200 mg or lasmiditan 100 mg (with a second dose of study drug permitted between 2 and 24 hours (h)
for recurrence of migraine only for subjects randomized to lasmiditan 100 mg ). During the treatment
period subjects will return to the clinic at 1, 3,6,9 and 12 months. There will be an early termination (ET) 
visit within two weeks ( 14 days )of treatment discontinuation for all subjects that discontinue between 
scheduled v isits. The End -of-Study (EoS ) visit will be at [ADDRESS_551369]’s participation in the study is ended. Participation in the study for 12 months will be defined as 
completing Month12/Visit 6 .
AtScreening /Visit1subjects will provide written informed consent and authorize Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Study eligibility will be assessed on the basis of completing 
study COL MIG-301 or COL MIG -302.  TheEoS/Visit 2 of COL MIG -301 or COL MIG-302 can be the 
same day as Screening/Visit 1.  Assessments required for this visit can be the same assessments 
obtained at theEoS/Visit 2of COL MIG-301 or COL MIG-302 as long as that visit occurred on the 
same day or no more than twoweeks prior to signing informed consent and HIPAA for participation in 
COL MIG-305 as outlined in the Schedule of Assessments (Table 1).Regardless of the timing of

LY573144 Page 4of 74signing of informed consent for COL MIG-305, m edical history, migraine history and concomi tant 
medication use will be reviewed and any changes or updates since enrolling in COL MIG-301 or COL 
MIG-302 will be noted. All subjects will complete the MIDAS questionnaire.   If Screening/Visit 1 is not 
the same day as EoS/V2 of COL MIG-[ADDRESS_551370] will also be done. Subjects that are consented more 
than two weeks afterEoS/Visit 2of COL MIG-301 or COL MIG-302 will undergo the following 
assessments: acomplete physical examination, vital signs, clinical laboratory tests (including urine 
pregnancy test on women of child -bearing potential (WOCBP)) and 12 -lead ECG .A Columbia Suicide 
Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) will be completed.   All subjects will be randomized and dispensed 
study drug and instructed to use lasmiditan as the first treatment for each migraine attack. Subjects will 
be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio, to receive lasmiditan 100 mg (L100 mg) or lasmiditan 200 mg 
(L200 mg). Subjects randomi zed to lasmiditan 100 mgwill be allowed to take a second dose of study 
drug if needed for recurrence of migraine .
Treatment Period: Subjects will be asked to use lasmiditan as the first treatment for each new 
migraine attack within [ADDRESS_551371] dose over the nex t 48 hours using an electronic 
diary. If the migraine respond swithin 2 hours (headache becomes pain free) but then recurs after 
2hours ,a second dose of study drug may be taken up to [ADDRESS_551372] their response to a second dose, taken for 
recurrence, for 48 hours in the electronic diary. The total time for recording response to study drug is 
up to 72 hours depending on whether or not a second dose of study drug is used (for subjects 
randomized to lasmiditan 100 mg ).Subjects using an alternate medication other than a second dose of 
study drug for the treatment of migraine rescue or recurrence will report the use of medication and 
continue to record their response s in the electronic diary up to the 48 hour timepoint.
Subjects will be asked to return to the clinic at months 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 (Visits 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6) . At each 
visit a brief physical examination based on adv erse events (AEs), vital signs and a urine pre gnancy test 
on all WOCBP will be obtained . Blood and urine samples for clinical laboratory parameters 
(hematology, serum chemistry and urinalysis) will be obtained atMonth 1/Visit 2, Month 6/Visit 4and 
Month 12/Visit 6 (EoS/ET).A 12-lead ECG will be obtained atMonth 6/Visit 4and Month 12/Visit 6
(EoS/ET). C-SSRS will be completed at each visit. The MIDAS questionnaire will be completed at 
Month 3/Visit 3, Month6/Visit 4, Month 9/Visit 5and Month 12/Visit 6 (EoS/ET).  At each visit, 
resource utilization, AEs, use of concomitant medication, use of study drug and patient diary compliance 
will be assessed; subjects who are continuing will bedispensed study drug.  Subjects who decide to 
withdraw at a scheduled visit should confirm the date of thevisit is 7days (± 2 days) from their last 
migraine treated with study drug.  Subjects who decide to discontinue between scheduled visits are 
asked to contact [CONTACT_435310] /Visit 6within two weeks (14 days) after discontinuation of 
dosing .  The total time onstudy is up to54 weeks (a maximum of 378 days) .
Subject Population: Adult patients with a history of migraine who hav e completed COL MIG -301or 
COL MIG -302.  
Number of Subjects:   Approximately 2 580subjects 
(combined from COL MIG -301 and COL MIG -302)
will be enroll ed, with the goal of having a t least 300 
patients dose an av erage of 2 migraines per month 
for 6 months and 100 patients dose an av erage of 2

Statistical Analysis:
Safety:
Adverse ev ents will be summarized in terms of the proportion of patients and the proportion of attacks 
associated with any adverse ev ent and with specific adverse ev ents. Physical examinations, vital signs, 
clinical laboratory parameters (hematology, serum chemistry and urinalysis) and EC G parameters will be 
summarized in terms of change from baseline status at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months or early termination.
Efficacy:
This is an open -label study with no control group. Efficacy data will be summarized using descriptive 
statistics. The propo rtion of attacks treated with study medication which respond at 2 hours will be 
calculated for each 3 month period.
Resource Utilization:
Resource utilization such as visits to cardiologists, procedures, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], new treatments or 
treatment adjus tments for CV disease as well as visits to the emergency room or a physician’s office for 
the treatment of migraine will be summarized by [CONTACT_435311] -301 or COL MIG -302 compared to inform ation reported at Visits 2, 3, 4, 5, 
and EoS/ET/6.Concomitant medication use for migraine and/or pain and missed days of work and/or 
school or daily activities based on responses to MIDAS questionnaire will be summarized by [CONTACT_54012].
Sample Size Rationale  
The sample size was chosen to provide an appropriate long -term safety database. It is not based on

Migraine is a common neurological disorder and was ranked by [CONTACT_38375] 
(WHO) in their [ADDRESS_551388] common disease in the world among both males and females.[1]
Although the introduction of triptans greatly improved the acute treatment of migraine, a large 
percentage of patients still lack adequate treatment. A recent study by [CONTACT_435314] (AMPP) concluded that 40% of epi[INVESTIGATOR_435285] s; the most frequent complaints were headache -related disability (19%) 
and dissatisfaction with current medications (15 %).[2]Inaddition, concerns about cardiovascular
safety are believed to limit the prescription of triptan s to less than 50% of migraineurs in the US .
[3]Hence, there is a significant unmet need for novel migraine therapi[INVESTIGATOR_15128] a distinct 
mechanism of action from triptans. One such agent is lasmiditan (COL -144). Unlike any 
approved treatment for acute migraine, lasmiditan selectively targets 5-HT 1Freceptors on 
neurons in the central and peripheral trigeminal system to alleviate migraine, and lacks the 
vasoconstrictor activity inherent withtriptans.  
Lasmiditan is being developed as a novel acute therapy for migraine and to fulfill significant 
unmet needs in migraine patients with risk factors for undiagnosed cardiovascular disease, and 
those who respond poorly to their current prescription medication for acute migraine. The 
current mainstay migraine therapi[INVESTIGATOR_435286] (‘triptans’), developed 
for their potent cranial vasoconstrictor properties .[4]  Triptans are selective 5-HT 1B/1D receptor 
agonists andmediate their vasoconstrictor activity via 5-HT 1Breceptors expressed on vascular 
smooth muscle .[5]Aslarge numbers of patients were exposed to triptans, it was established 
through post-marketing surveillance that their vasoconstrictor mechanism of action also 
conferred a risk of serious cardiovascular adverse events, some fatal.[3] Consistent with their 
common pharmacology, sumatriptan, zolmitriptan, rizatriptan, eletriptan and naratript an all 
induced comparable dose -dependent contraction of isolated human coronary arteries .[5,6,7]   
Because of the liability of triptans to cause coronary vasospasm, they are contraindicated in 
patients with known coronary artery disease (CAD), and it is strongly recommended that they 
are notprescribed to patients with risk factors for undiagnosed CAD (e.g., hypertension,
hypercholesterol emia, smoker, obesity, diabetes, strong family history of CAD, female with
surgical or physiological menopause, male over 40 years of age) without first undergoing a
thorough cardiovascular evaluation. 
Treatment of migraineurs with known cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular risk factors is
particularly challenging because the incidence of myocardial infarction, stroke, claudication,
diabetes, hypertension and hypercholesterolemia are all higher in individuals with migraine
compared with the general population .[8]Many migraineurs who were previously eligible for 
triptan therapy may become ineligible as they age and develop cardiovascular disease and/or 
associated risk factors. For these patients, there is a pressing need for an effective migraine 
therapy with a non -vascular mechanism of action.
This study is a Phase [ADDRESS_551389] dose for the treatment of a migraine attack .  Asecond dose of 
study drug is allowed to investigate the safety of lasmiditan 200 mg and lasmiditan 100 mg 
when taken for rescue or when taken for recurrence of migraine . In addition to safety 
assessments, the efficacy of long term intermittent use of lasmiditan will be evaluated. Data 
from this study will be used to further investigate and confirm the safety and efficacy of 
Eli Lilly and Company                                         IND 103,420
H8H-CD-LAHL( D)/COL MIG -[ADDRESS_551390] with > 470-fold higher affinity 
(Ki2.21 nM) for the 5-HT 1Freceptor than for 5-HT 1B/1D receptors in radioligand binding assays.  
Based on activation of G proteins, the agonist efficacy of lasmiditan at the 5-HT 1Freceptor was 
~80% that of 5-HT.  Lasmiditan is a pyridinoylpi[INVESTIGATOR_435287], structurally unrelated to 
existing migraine therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  Lasmiditan (1 µM) was examined for its binding affinity at more 
than 50other GPCRs, ion channels, and transporter sites, and had no significant affinities 
except at the benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_435288] (Ki0.29 µM).  Unlike
diazep am, lasmiditan did not potentiate GABA currents in a human cloned GABA Achannel 
functional assay, and hence this binding affinity was not considered to be biologically relevant. 
In rodent models of migraine, selective 5-HT 1F receptor agonists inhibited trigeminal nociceptive 
processing without affecting blood vessel tone.[9,10,11]  Unlike triptans, lasmiditan did not constrict 
rabbit saphenous vein,[9]an assay predictive of human coronary artery constriction.[12]  
Lasmiditan is under development as a neurally acting treatment for migraine without the 
vasoconstrictor liability of triptans .
4.2Clinical Studies to Date
Five Phase [ADDRESS_551391] been completed in Europe using intravenous (IV), sublingual, and 
oral formulations of lasmiditan .  Two European Phase [ADDRESS_551392] been completed with 
lasmiditan in the acute treatment of migraine. 
Lasmiditan was well tolerated in healthy volunteers following 20 minute IV infusions at dose 
levels of 0.1 to 20 mg with few AEs reported (clinical study H8H-BD-LACA ).  There was a clear 
increase in the number of AEs reported following 20minute IV infusions of [ADDRESS_551393] were rated as mild.  The number of AEs reported following 60 mg of 
lasmiditan decreased significantly when the rate of infusion was reduced from 3 to 1 mL/min 
and the infusion time was increased to 60minutes, although the number of subjects reporting 
AEs was similar.  All subjects receiving [ADDRESS_551394] dose levels (120 
and 180 mg of lasmiditan). The most frequently reported AEs considered to be related to the 
study drug were somnolence, paresthesia, dizziness and hot flushes.  These occurred with 
rapid onset, generally within 10minutes of the start of the infusion at all dose levels.  Adverse 
events typi[INVESTIGATOR_435289], chest tightness, chest pressure, neck pain or 
stiffness were not reported, even after the highest dose of 180 mg was administered.
A Phase 2, placebo -controlled clinical study to assess the efficacy and safety of intravenous 
lasm iditan in the acute treatment of migraine has been completed (clinical study COL MIG -201).  
This study was blinded with regard to dose and treatment allocation and employed doses of 
lasmiditan from 2.5 to 45 mg IV infused over 20 minutes.  One hundred and thirty (130) patients 
were treated in the study and no serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported.  The only AE 
that was clearly dose related was paresthesia; however, most of these events were reported as

A Phase 1 placebo -controlled study assessed the safety and tolerability and pharmacokinetic 
(PK) profile of sublingual and oral lasmidit an (clinical study COL MIG-102).  The sublingual 
route of administration was investigated using ascending single doses from [ADDRESS_551395] arm of the study, the safety and tolerability of 100 
mg and 400 mg of the oral solution formulation were evaluated in an additional cohort of 
subjects.  The tolerability of both the oral and sublingual route of administration was good.  
However, the sublingual route did not show any advantage in comparison to the oral route of 
administration since there was no evidence of enhanced bioavailability in terms of exposure 
(Cmax, AUC 0–t) or time to peak concentration (tmax).  The oral route of administration was 
therefore selected for further study.  Oral doses of the solution formulation were generally well 
tolerated up to the maximum dose tested of 400 mg lasmiditan.  There were no clinically 
significant changes in safety parameters or clinical laboratory results. 
The assessment of bioequivalence of the oral solution and tablet formulations of 200 mg 
lasmiditan and of dose linearity of ascending doses of 50, 200 and 400 mg lasmiditan of a tablet 
formulation were investigated in a further clinical Phase 1 study (clinical study COL MIG-103), 
including also the assessment of safety and tolerability.  In general, lasmiditan was well 
tolerated across all doses.  The most common AEs across all doses with a dose -related 
increase in frequency were fatigue and dizziness followed by [CONTACT_435316].
In the Thorough QT study (clinical study COL MIG-105) which was designed, performed and 
analyzed in accordance with the ICH E14 guidance ,[13]the primary objective was to assess the 
effect of 100 mg lasmiditan and 400 mg lasmiditan on cardiac de-and re-polarization. The 
statistical evaluation of the primary variable revealed that lasmiditan caused no significant QT 
prolongation either at 100 mg or at 400 mg.  The results met the criteria for a negative thorough 
QT/QTc study according to ICH E14 .[13]
The bioavailability of lasmiditan 200mg administered orally as a tablet formulation under fed 
and fasted conditions was investigated (clinical study COL MIG-104). A slight delay in the time 
to reach maximum plasma concentration was observed in the fed state. As in other Phase [ADDRESS_551396] common AEs across both conditions were 
somnolence, dizziness, orthostatic hypotension (with and without dizziness) and paresthesia .
The efficacy of oral lasmiditan in the acute treatment of migraine was evaluated in a Phase 2 
double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group dose -ranging study conducted in five European 
countries (clinical study COL MIG -202).  A total of 391 subjects treated a single migraine attack 
at home using one of four doses of lasmiditan (50, 100, 200 or 400 mg) or placebo.  The 
proportion of patients with headache relief (moderate or severe headache becoming mild or 
none) or who were pain free showed statistically significant dose responses at 2 hours after 
treatment. Associated symptoms such as nausea, phonophobia and photophobia also 
responded to lasmiditan.  There were no clinically significant changes in clinical laboratory 
parameters, ECGs or vita l signs.
Treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported by 22% of the subjects receiving 
placebo and by 65, 73, 86 and 84% of subjects receiving 50, 100, 200 and 400 mg lasmiditan, 
Eli Lilly and Company                                         IND 103,420
H8H-CD-LAHL( D)/COL MIG -[ADDRESS_551397] symptoms characteristic of triptan use were rare and occurred with a similar frequency in 
the placebo and active groups .
During the clinical development of lasmiditan there were no deaths and no subjects were 
withdrawn due to adverse events.  One serious adverse event (SAE)of moderate dizziness 
leading to overnight hospi[INVESTIGATOR_435290] -ranging study.  Thisoccurred 
in a female patient given 200 mg lasmiditan , and resolved without sequelae.
More details on the preclinical and clinical experience with lasmiditan are given in the Clinical 
Investigator’s Brochure.[14]
4.3Minimization of Risk
The dose levels of lasmiditan ( 100 mg and 200 mg) have previously been tested and shown to 
be safe and well tolerated in healthy subjects and in patient swith acute migraine , including in 
Phase [ADDRESS_551398] their driving, operation of heavy
machinery, or other similar activities after taking study drug,as described in the informed 
consent form (ICF).
Rescue medication (other than study drug) will be permitted after completion of the 2 hour 
assessments if the migraine does not respond (subj ect is not headache pain free).  
For subjects randomized to lasmiditan 100 mg, if the migraine responds within 2 hours 
(headache becomes pain free) but then recurs after [ADDRESS_551399] dose.
To insure standardization ,all adverse events will be assessed using WHO Toxicity Criteria 
(Appendix 1).
4.4Potential Benefit
Migraine is a common disorder with a prevalence of 11.7% (17.1% of women and 5.4% of men)
based on a large population survey of US households. Nearly a third of sufferers experience
three or more migraine attacks a month, and over half report that the attacks cause severe
disability or require bedrest.[15]Despi[INVESTIGATOR_435291], it is 
estimated that less than half of all migraine ursuse prescription medication to manage their 
disease, indicating a substantial unmet medical need . [16]
In the completed Phase 2 studies, lasmiditan was effective in alleviating migraine attacks when 
given by [CONTACT_435317] .This study will recruit patients meeting the 
internationally recognized diagnostic criteria for migraine set by [CONTACT_435318] (IHS) who complete Phase 3 studies COL MIG -301 or COL MIG -302.

lasmiditan 200mg,asthefirst and asasecond dose, intheacute treatment ofmigraine.
5.2Secondary objectives
Toexplore thelong-term efficacy oflasmiditan 100 mgand lasmiditan 200 mginterms of
headache response over time.
5.3Additional Objectives
To compare patient reported resource utilization during the study to patient reported information 
from COL MIG -301 or COL MIG- 302 in terms of cardiovascular events and in terms of migraine 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841].
5.4Overall Study Design and Plan: Description
This isaprospective, randomized, open -label study insubjects with migraine who have
completed CoLucid Phase 3 study, COL MIG-301orCOL MIG-302. Subjects will be stratified (yes 
or no) for use of concomitant medications that reduce the frequency of migraine epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841].
Subjects willbeasked totreat allmigraine attacks with study drug on an outpatient basis for
upto12months. Each patient’s study participation willconsist of a screening visit (Visit 1) and 
a treatment period of up to [ADDRESS_551401] willtreat all migraine attacks
with either lasmiditan 200 mgorlasmiditan 100 mg (with asecond dose of study drug
permitted between 2and 24 hours (h)forrecurrence ofmigraine only for subjects 
randomized to lasmiditan 100 mg). During the treatment period subjects will return to the clinic 
at 1,3,6,9 and 12 months. There will be an early termination (ET) visit within two weeks

The End-of-Study (EoS) visit will be at [ADDRESS_551402]’s 
participation in the study is ended. Participation in the study for 12 months willbe defined as 
completing Month 12/Visit 6 .
AtScreening /Visit 1subjects willprovide written informed consent and authorize Health
Insurance Portability andAccountability Act(HIPAA). Study eligibility willbeassessed onthe
basis ofcompleting study COL MIG-301 or COL MIG-302.  The EoS/Visit 2of COL MIG-301 
or COL MIG-302 can be the same day as Screening/Visit 1.  Assessments required forthis
visit canbethesame assessments obtained attheEoS/Visit 2of COL MIG-301 or COL MIG-
302 aslong asthat visit occurred on the same day ornomore than two weeks prior to
signing informed consent and HIPAA forparticipation inCOL MIG-305 as outlined in the 
Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 ). Regardless of the timing of signing of informed consent for 
COL MIG-305, medical history, migraine history and concomitant medication use will be 
reviewed and any changes or updates since enrolling in COL MIG- 301 or COL MIG -302 will be 
noted. All subjects will complete the MIDAS questionnaire.  If Screening/Visit 1 is not the same 
day as EoS/V2 of COL MIG-[ADDRESS_551403] will also be done.  Subjects that are 
consented more than two weeks after EoS/Visit 2of COL MIG-301 or COL MIG-302 will 
undergo the following assessments: acomplete physical examination, vital signs, clinical
laboratory tests (including urine pregnancy test on women of child -bearing potential (WOCBP))
and12-lead ECG. AColumbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) willbecompleted .  All 
subjects willberandomized anddispensed study drug and instructed touse lasmiditan as
thefirst treatment foreach new migraine attack. Subjects willberandomly assigned ina
1:1ratio, toreceive lasmiditan 100mg(L100 mg)orlasmiditan 200mg(L200 mg). Subjects
randomized to lasmiditan 100 mgwill be allowed to take a second dose of study drug if
needed forrecurrence ofmigraine.
Treatment Period: Subjects will be asked to use lasmiditan as the first treatment for each new 
migraine attack within [ADDRESS_551404] dose over the next 
48 hours using an electronic diary. For subjects randomized to lasmiditan 100 mg, if the 
migraine does respond within 2 hours (headache becomes pain free) but then recurs after [ADDRESS_551405] their responses in the electronic diary up to the 48 
hour timepoint.
Subjects will be asked to return to the clinic at months 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 (Visits 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6). 
At each visit a brief physical examination based on adverse events (AEs), vital signs and a urine 
pregnancy test on all WOCBP will be obtained.  Blood and urine samples for clinical laboratory 
parameters (hematology, serum chemistry and urinalysis) will be obtained at Month 1/Visit 2, 
Month 6/Visit 4and Month 12/Visit 6(EoS/ET ). A 12-lead ECG will be obtained at Month 
6/Visit 4and Month 12/Visit 6(EoS/ET ). C-SSRS will be completed at each visit. The MIDAS 
questionnaire will be completed at Month 3/Visit 3, Month6/Visit 4, Month 9/Visit 5and 
Month 12/Visit 6 (EoS/ET).   At each visit, resource utilization, AEs, use of concomitant 
medication, use of study drug and patient diary compliance will be assessed; subjects who are

For subjects who are lost to follow -up (i.e., those subjects whose status is unclear because they 
fail to appear for study visits without stating an intention to withdraw), the Investigator should 
show “due diligence” by [CONTACT_435320], e.g., dates of telephone calls, registered letters, etc.
All subjects discontinuing from the trial before a scheduled visit regardles s of cause, must be 
seen for ET/Visit 6for safety assessments and to return all unused study drug and the e -diary .  
Subjects that withdraw f rom the study prior to dosing a migraine attack should return to the clinic 
for ET/Visit 6to return all unused study drug and the e -diary .Subjects that desire to withdraw 
from the study at one of the scheduled visits ( Visit 2, 3, 4 or 5) should complete the EoS/Visit 6
study assessments and return all unused study drug and the e -diary.
Subjects who are withdrawn from the study for any reason will not be replaced .

LY573144 Page 33of 74Urinalysis:  protein, glucose, nitrite, ketones, blood (hemoglobin), pH, specific gravity, 
microscopic bacteria, RBCs, WBCs, casts, crystals, and cells. Microscopic examination of 
sediment will be performed only if the results of the urinalysis dipstick evaluation are positive.
For WOCBP, a urine pregnancy test for β-HCG will be performed at the Screening /Visit 1
(test will count for EoS/Visit 2for COL M IG-301 or COL MIG -302 i f visit is same day) .  A urine 
pregnancy test will be performed at each visit. If a urine pregnancy test is positive during the 
study the subject will be discontinued from the study after confirmation with a positive serum 
βHCG .A subject with a positive urine βHCG must not be dosed unless a negative serum βHCG 
is obtained. The confirmatory serum test may be performed at the local clinical laboratory.
[IP_ADDRESS] Abnormal and Clinically Significa nt Results
The Investigator must categorize all abnormal hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis laboratory 
values as either CS orNCS. Clinical significance is defined as any variation in laboratory 
parameters, which has medical consequences that result in an alteration in the subject’s 
medical care. The Investigator will use the WHO Toxicity Criteria (see Appendix 1) as a guide 
when evaluating the clinical significance of all abnormal clinical laboratory results. In case of 
CS laboratory results, the Investigator will continue to monitor the subject with additional 
laboratory assessments until (1) values have reached normal range and/or baseline levels, or 
(2) the Investigator has judged that the abnormal values are not related to the administration of 
study drug or other protocol -specific procedures.
[IP_ADDRESS] Hepatic Safety Monitoring
If a study subject experiences elevated ALT ≥3X ULN, AST ≥3X ULN, ALP ≥2X ULN, or 
elevated TBL ≥2X ULN, liver testing (Appendix 5) should be repeated within [ADDRESS_551434], TBL, 
and ALP should continue until levels normalize or retur n to approximate baseline levels. 
Hepatic Safety Data Collection
Additional safety data should be collected if 1 or more of the following conditions occur: 
Elevation of serum ALT to ≥5X ULN on 2 or more consecutive blood tests
Elevation of serum AST to ≥5X ULN on 2 or more consecutive blood tests
Elevated serum TBL to ≥ 2X ULN (except for cases of known Gilbert’s syndrome) 
Elevation of serum ALP to ≥2X ULN on 2 or more consecutive blood tests
Subject discontinued from treatment due to a hepatic event or abnormality of liver tests
Hepatic event considered to be a SAE
9.1.6Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale 
C-SSRS is a suicidal ideation rating scale that rates an individual's degree of suicidal ideation 
on a scale, ranging from "wish to be dead" to "active suicidal ideation with specific plan and 
intent”. The scale intends to prospectively identify and classify suicidal ideation and behavior 
based on a semi -structured interview by [CONTACT_435329].  
If Screening /Visit 1 is the same day or within 2 weeks of EoS/Visit 2of COL MIG-301 
or COL MIG -302 the data obtained will be used for both studies.

Subjects will be asked to treat each migraine attack within [ADDRESS_551435] their 
response over the next 48 hours using an electronic diary. Subjects should not exceed a total 
dose of 200 mg of lasmiditan in a 24-hour period. Subjects will be instructed not to use rescue 
medication (other than study drug) until at least [ADDRESS_551436] 
does not become headache pain free within 2 hours, rescue medication (other than study drug)
will be permitted after completion of the [ADDRESS_551437] NOT be used for rescue medication within 24 hours of study drug administration. For 
subjects randomized to lasmiditan 100 mg,if the migraine responds within 2 hours (headache

Subjects will be trained on the use of the electronic diary at Screening/Visit [ADDRESS_551439] dose of study drug.  All migraines treated with study 
drug will be recorded in the diary.
For each migraine, subjects will be asked to assess their headache severity at specified time
points: 0 (pre dose), 0.5, 1, 2, 4,and [ADDRESS_551440] dose using the IHS four point
headache severity rating scale (0 = no pain, 1 = mild pain, 2 = moderate pain, and 3 = severe 
pain). The need for an alternative treatment as rescue medication will be assessed between 2 
and 24 hoursand at 48 hours .  Recurrence ofpain and second dosing ofstudy drug (only for 
those randomized to lasmiditan 100 mg)will be assessed between 2 and 24 hours and at 48 
hours.
Atthe same time points, specified above ,subjects will grade the degree ofinterference with 
normal activities and the presence or absence (yes or no) of accompanying symptoms: 
photophobia, phonophobia and nausea . At time 0 (pre dose) subjects will select from the
accompanying symptoms present (nausea, phon ophobia or pho tophobia) which one is the most 
bothersome to them .Subjects will be asked to record the presence or absence (yes or no) of 
vomiting. Subjects will also be asked to record the exact time at which headache relief became

The diary will also be used to record any symptoms or side effects the subject is experiencing 
and the use of any concomitant medications.   The diary is to be completed for the duration of a 
subject’s participation in the study. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Recording Use of Rescue Medication and Migraine Symptoms
Any use of a rescue medication (other than study drug) taken because headache pain free dom
is not achieved at 2 hours will be recorded .Subjects will document the date and time of dosing 
for rescue and any migraine symptoms they are experiencing at time of dosing and at time 
points specified above .  Migraine pain will be graded as none (0), mild (1), moderate (2) or 
severe (3) and other symptoms ( nausea, phonophobia, or photophobia) will be recorded as yes 
or no.At time 0 (pre dose) subjects will select from the accom panying symptoms present

will be asked to record the presence or absence (yes or no) of vomiting. Subjects willalso be
asked torecord the exact time atwhich headache reliefbecame meaningful to them and the 
time atwhich they become headache pain free. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Recording Recurrence and Migraine Symptoms
Ifmigraine recurs within [ADDRESS_551442] time when the
headache returns tomild, moderate, or severe intensity after being pain free. For subjects 
randomized to lasmiditan 100 mg, subjects willdocument thetime they take thesecond

9.2Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events
9.2.1Adverse Events
An AE is defined as any undesirable physical, psychological, or behavioral effect experienced 
by a subject during his/her participation in an investigational study, in conjunction with the use of 
the drug, whether or not product -related. During the treatment of a migrain e with study drug 
subjects will be asked if they are feeling anything unusual that they have not felt with a migraine 
before. A ‘yes’ response will trigger an alert to the site to contact [CONTACT_435330], how long the symptoms lasted and how much the 
symptom(s) impacted them. During the time between dosing, subjects will be asked how they 
are feeling. A response of ‘not well’ will trigger an alert to the site to contact [CONTACT_435331].  The occurrence of 
AEs should also be reviewed by [CONTACT_105]-directive questioning of the subject at each visit in the 
study.  AEs may include, but are not limited to :
•Subjective or objective symptoms spontaneously offered by [CONTACT_3184]/or observed by 
[CONTACT_204418], and

LY573144 Page 36of 74•Changes in laboratory abnormalities that are clinically relevant as assessed by [CONTACT_435332] a medical intervention wa s initiated. 
Disease signs, symptoms, and/or laboratory abnormalities already existing prior to the use of 
the product are not considered AEs after treatment unless they reoccur after the subject has 
recovered from the pre-existing condition or, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689]; they represent a 
clinically significant exacerbation in intensity or frequency. AEs are collected from the time the 
subject signs the informed consent form until the completion of EoS/ET/Visit 6.  AEs reported 
prior todosing willbe captured and considered non-treatment emergent AEs. AEsreported [ADDRESS_551443] be recorded in the site’s study records and the AE CRF with the following 
information:
1.Relationship to Study Drug :  The Investigator must assess whether they consider anAE to 
bedrug-related. In assessing this relationship, the Investigator must use information about 
the drug as outlined in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB), the subject’s pre-existent medical 
conditions/concurrent medication, and chronology of the event relative to drug 
administration. The following definitions will be used:
Reasonably or possibly related applies to those AEs that, after careful medical 
consideration at the time they are evaluated, are considered by [CONTACT_737] (or 
other qualified physician ) to have at least a possible relationship to study drug.
Not reasonably or not possibly related applies to those AEs that, after careful 
medical consideration at the time they are evaluated, are considered by [CONTACT_3786] (or other qualified physician ) to have no relationship, or no reasonable 
possibility of a r elationship, to study drug.
2.Event Severity:  The Investigator will be asked to assess the severity of the AE using the 
WHO Toxicity Criteria, as shown in Appendix 1. The WHO criteria assign a grade of 1 
through 4 to indicate the severity of AEs. For AEs that are not listed in the WHO criteria, the 
Investigator will use medical judgment to assess the severity of the AE.
The following are guidelines to be used by [CONTACT_435333]:
Mild -awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated
   Moderate -discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activity
   Severe -incapacitating with inability to work or perform usual activity
   Life Threatening
3.Duration: Start and end dates and times, or if continuing.

5.Whether it constitutes a SAE, per definition below.
6.Outcome: resolved, resolved/ with sequelae, continuing, death, or unknown (only for 
subjects that are lost to follow -up).
The investigator (or designee) should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the AE based on the 
sign, symptoms and/or other clinical information.  In such cases, the diagnosis, and not the 
individual signs/symptoms or laboratory abnormalities should be documents in the subject’s 
source documentation and the CRF unless the etiology of the event is unknown.  An 
assessment should be made at each visit (or more frequently if necessary) of any changes in 
severity, the suspected relationship to study drug, the interventions required to treat it and the 
outcome.
9.2.2Treatment Emergent A dverse Events (TEA E)
A TEAE will be an AE that occurred during the study after the first dose of study drug or that 
was present prior to dosing and exacerbates after the first dose of study drug. Based on the 
half-life of study drug (3.5-4 hours) and the varied time between dosing a migraine attack, the 
temporal relationship of anadverse event to time of dosing will be as assessed prior to 
considering the adverse event to be a TEAE. Any new AE recorded 48 hours after a dose of 
study drug will not be considered a TEAE.
9.2.3Serious A dverse Events
An SAE is any AE that results in any of the following outcomes:
•Death : This includes death unrelated to the study drug (e.g. car accident).  If a subject dies 
during the study and an autopsy is performed, autopsy results will become part of the 
subject’s study chart and a copy should be sent to the Sponsor.
•Life-threatening experience
•Required or prolonged inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] : Exceptions will be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5315] a) 
elective or preplanned treatment for a pre -existing condition that is unrelated to the indication 
under study and has not worsened since the start of study drug or b) treatment on an 
emergency outpatient basis fo r an event not fulfilling any of the definitions of a SAE and not 
resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063] 
•Persistent or significant disability/incapacity
•Congenital anomaly
•Important medical events that may not result in death, be immediately life threateni ng, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a SAE when, based upon medical judgment, they 
may jeopardize the patient and may require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed above.
9.2.4 Unexpected A dverse Event
An unexpected adverse even t is defined as an AE, the nature or severity of which is not 
consistent with the information in the Investigator’s Brochure for lasmiditan .
9.3Reporting Serious Adverse Events
The Investigator is responsible for reporting all SAEs, regardless of causality , to the Sponsor 
or their designated representative by [CONTACT_39985] [ADDRESS_551444] signs the informed 
Eli Lilly and Company                                         IND 103,420
H8H-CD-LAHL( D)/COL MIG -[ADDRESS_551445] dose of study treatment at EoS/ET/Visit 6.  At a 
minimum, a description of the event and the Investigator’s judgment of causality must be 
provided at the time of the initial report. These preliminary reports will be followed by [CONTACT_435334][INVESTIGATOR_99606]-identified hospi[INVESTIGATOR_435296], autopsy reports, and 
other documents when requested and applicable.
Complications or progression of an initial SAE must be reported as a follow -up SAE Report to 
theoriginal SAE, regardless of when the follow -up information is received by [CONTACT_737] .  A 
follow -up SAE Report must be submitted within [ADDRESS_551446] continued or withdrew from study participation. 
If the SAE was not previously documented in the Investigator’s Brochure and is thought to be 
related to study drug, the Sponsor or their designee may urgentl y require further information 
from the Investigator for regulatory authority reporting. The Sponsor may need to issue an 
Investigator Notification to inform all investigators involved in any study with the same drug that 
this SAE has been reported.
The Investigator and study personnel should institute any supplemental investigations of SAEs 
based on their clinical judgment of likely causative factors. This may include clinical laboratory 
tests not specified in the protocol, histopathologic examinations, or consultations with 
specialists. The Sponsor or their designee may also request the Investigator to conduct 
supplemental assessments.
The Investigator should notify Quintiles Pharmacovigilance of any death or SAE occurring after 
a subject has withdrawn from the study when such a death or SAE may reasonably be related 
to the study drug. However, the Investigator is not obligated to actively seek adverse events in 
former study p articipants.
9.4Follow-up of adverse events
All SAEs and any non -serious adverse events or laboratory abnormalities resulting in premature 
discontinuation will be followed until they have resolved, returned to baseline, or are determined 
to be chronic orstable by [CONTACT_737] .  Other non-serious adverse events should be 
followed through the EoS/ET/Visit6.  
9.5Reporting safety information to the IRB/EC
The Investigator is responsible for following all local regulations for the reporting of safety 
information, including the reporting of SAEs to the IRB/ EC .
The Investigator must promptly report to his or her IRB /ECall unanticipated problems involving 
risks to subjects.  This includes death from any cause and all serious adverse events 
reasonably or possibly associated with the use of study drug.  It is recommended that all SAEs 
occurring at a site, regardless of ca usality, be reported to the site’s IRB/EC in accordance with 
the IRB/EC’s requirements.

LY573144 Page 39of 74Lasmiditan has been filed under an Investigational New Drug (IND) application with the US 
FDA.  An SAE may require safety reports to be filed to regulatory agencies if the SAE is related 
to the study drug and is unexpected based upon the current Investigator’s Brochure.  In this 
case, the Investigator will receive a copy of the safety report as submitted to the regulatory 
agencies.  The Investigator is responsible for submitting the safety report (initial and follow -up) 
or other safety information (e.g., revised Investigator’s Brochure) to the IRB/EC in accordance 
with the IRB/EC’s requirements and keep a copy in their files.
9.6Pregnancies
To ensure subject safety, each pregnancy in a subject on study drug must be reported to the 
medical monitor within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence.  Subjects who become pregnant 
will be withdrawn from the study.  The pregnancy should be followed up to determine outcome, 
includ ing spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of the birth, and the presence or 
absence of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn 
complications. 
Pregnancy should be recorded on a subject’s source documents and a Pregn ancy Notification 
and Outcome Form and reported by [CONTACT_435335] 9.3. A pregnancy, by [CONTACT_5071], is not a SAE.  
Pregnancy follow -up should also be recorded and should i nclude an assessment of the possible 
relationship to the study drug of any pregnancy outcome. Any pregnancy -related SAE (e.g. 
spontaneous abortion) or any other SAE experienced during pregnancy must be recorded on a 
separate SAE Report Form and reported p er SAE reporting procedures in Section 9.[ADDRESS_551447] data for 
inclusion in the statistical analysis.  All safety analyses will be based on the Safety Population. 
The efficacy analyses and baseline characteristics will be based on the Intent -to-Treat (ITT) and 
mITT population . The Per Protocol Population will be used to support the ITTanalyses.
The primary objective of this study is toevaluate thesafety and tolerability oflong-term
intermittent useoflasmiditan 100mgand of lasmiditan 200mg,asthefirstand as asecond
dose, intheacute treatment ofmigraine.
The secondary objective of the study is to explore the long-term efficacy of lasmiditan [ADDRESS_551448] dose.   Analysis will beperformed on the subset of 
subjects that dosed for rescue and on the subset that dosed for recurrence of migraine.
Data from all investigative sites will be pooled for all planned analyses.  Analysis of individual 
site findings will be considered if necessary.  For those measures that are summarized using 
change from baseline scores, observed scores may also be presented descriptively.

recurrence populations as defined:
Rescue population :All randomized subjects who did not achieve headache pain free at 
2 hours, completed the 2 hour assessments and took a second dose of study drug 
between 2 hours and 24 hours. 
Recurrence population :All randomized subjects who achieved headache pain free at [ADDRESS_551451] characteristics will be obtained at the Screening/Visit 1prior to randomization and will 
be summarized by [CONTACT_166884]. Summaries will include descriptive statistics for 
continuous measures (sample size, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, maximum) 
and for categorical measu res (sample size, frequency and percent ages ).  
The results of these tests will be used in a descriptive way to highlight potential imbalances 
between the treatment groups.  Subject characteristics may include, but are not limited to: age, 
gender, race/et hnicity, height, weight, BMI, and migraine history .
Subject characteristics will be summarized on all study populations.
10.4.3Treatment Exposure
Treatment exposure will be assessed in terms of the actual dose.  Summary statistics will be 
performed on the number of subjects who took a first dose for the treatment of their migraine 
and the number of subjects who took both a first and second dose.  The average dosage used 
per month in three month intervals and the cumulative doses taken over the course of the study 
will be summarized within each treatment arm using descriptive statistics (n, mean, SD, median, 
minimum, and maximum) .

proportion of attacks associated with any adverse event and with specific adverse events .
10.5.1Adverse Events 
AEs will be coded by [CONTACT_67503] (MedDRA ) preferred terms, 
and all summary tables for AEs will be organized by [CONTACT_32219]. Frequency counts and 
percentages will be presented for subjects with AEs within each system organ class and 
preferred term, separated by [CONTACT_435344] (the first dose and the second dose for 
recurrence or rescue or alternative rescue medication).  Both subjects ever experiencing an 
event as well as total events will be presented.  Descriptive statistics will also be calculated for 
each treatment arm and dose (initial and second dose for recurrence or rescue medication) for
AE relationship and AE severity. If multiple intensities are reported for a given AE for a subject, 
the most severe intensity will be counted. A separate, similar analysis will be conducted for 
TEAEs.
An AE with the date of onset on or within [ADDRESS_551452] listings of physical examinations, vital signs, ECG parameters and clinical laboratory 
data will include indications of values that are outside the reference ranges, and values that are 
clinically significant.  Observed and chan ge from baseline (Screening/Visit 1) values for vital 
signs, ECGs, and clinical laboratory test results will be summarized as appropriate by [CONTACT_435345]. Shift tables describing out-of-reference range shifts will be provided for vital 
signs, ECGs and clinical laboratory test results from the Screening/Visit 1to EoS/Visit 6, as 
appropriate by [CONTACT_435344].
10.5.3C-SSRS
By-subject listings of any suicidal ideation or behavior will be listed.
10.6Efficacy Analyses
This is an open -label study with no control group.  Efficacy data will be summarized using 
descriptive statistics. The proportion of attacks treated with lasmiditan 100 mg and with 
lasmiditan 200 mg which respond at 2 hours will be calculated for each 3 m onth period.
10.6.1Headache Response
Headache pain freeat 2 hours will be defined as a reduction in headache severity from 
moderate (2) or severe (3)at baseline to none (0)two hours after dosing with study drug.  MBS  
free at 2 hours will be defined as a ‘no’ response to the presence of thesymptom (either 
nausea, phonophobia, or photophobia) that was identified as MBS at predose, 2 hours after 
dosing with study drug.
A qualifying migraine is defined as a migraine treated with study drug within 4 hou rs of onset

10.6.2Sensitivity Analyses of the Primary and Key Secondary Endpoints
The analyses of pain free at 2 hours and of MBS freeat 2 hours are defined as proportions .  
The prespecified approach for handling missing data is to assume that subjects with missing 
data are nonresponders .  While this approach is appropriately conservative, a sensitivity 
analysis will be incorporated to exclude subjects with missing data .

investigation. Only the Investigator or appointed persons in his/her team may fill out or correct 
the eCRFs. The eCRFs will display the subject number corresponding to the order of inclusion 
in the study (7 digits) and the initials of the subject (1 letter for forename , 1 letter for middle 
name [INVESTIGATOR_1238] 1letter for surname).
The Sponsor or their designee will review the eCRFs entered by [CONTACT_435354].  Queries will be sent to the investigational site using an electronic data 
query within the EDC system.  Designated investigational site staff will be required to respond to 
the query and make any necessary changes to the data.  
All corrections and alterations of data on the eCRFs must be made by [CONTACT_435355]. If corrections or alterations are 
required of paper source documents, corrections may be made in the following manner: strike 
through the datum to be corrected using a single line so that the original remains legible; 
correction fluid must never be used. The correction should be written to the side or above the 
original entry and must be initialed and dated by [CONTACT_435356].
It is the r esponsibility of the monitor to make certain that all data are completed on the eCRFs.
The Investigator and the monitor must sign and date the eCRF per the eCRF procedure in order 
to attest respectively to the:
authenticity of the data collected in the eCRF, and
coherence between the data in the eCRF and those in the source documents.
Concomitant medications entered into the database will be coded using the WHO Drug 
Reference List, which employs the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification system.  
Adverse events and medical history will be coded using the Medical dictionary for regulatory 
activities (MedDRA) terminology.
ECGs will be evaluated for safety through central readers and the results will be sent 
electronically to the study database.  Clinical laboratory samples will be processed through a 
central laborator yand the results will be sent electronically to the study database .
Randomization codes and data about all study drugs dispensed to the subject will be tracked 
using a centralized randomization process.  The system will be supplied by a vendor, who will 
also manage the database.  The database will be sent electronically to the study database (or a 
designated CRO).      
After the above actions have been completed and the database has been declared to be 
complete and accurate, it will be locked for data analysis.  Any changes to the database after 
that time can only be made with the approval of Lilly.
At the end of the study, the Investigator will receive a CD or DVD of all data submitted for 
subjects at that site.  This CD or DVD will serve as the archival copy and must be retained per 
the record retention policy.

The MIDAS (Migraine Disability Assessment) questionnaire was put together to help you measure the
impact your headaches hav e on your life. The information on this questionnaire is also helpful for your
primary care provider to determine the level of pain and disability caused by [CONTACT_435366].
INSTRUCTIONS: Please ans wer the following questions about ALL of the headaches you hav e had over 
the last [ADDRESS_551467] 3 months did you miss work or school
because of your headaches?
__________ 2. How many days in the last 3 months was your productivity at work or
school reduced by [CONTACT_125012]? (Do not
include days you counted in question 1 wher e you missed work or
school.)
__________ 3. On how many days in the last 3 months did you not do household work
(such as housework, home repairs and maintenance, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007], caring
for children and relatives) because of your headaches?
__________ 4. How many days in the last 3 months was your productivity in household
work reduced by [CONTACT_435367]? (Do not
include days you counted in question 3 where you did not do household
work.)
__________ 5. On how many days in the last 3 months did you miss family, social or
leisure activities because of your headaches?
__________ Total (Questions 1 -5)
__________ A. On how many days in the last 3 months did you hav e a headache? (If a
headache lasted more than 1 day, count each day.)
__________ B. On a scale of 0 -10, on average how painful were these headaches?
(where 0 = no pain at all, and 10 = pain as bad as it can be.)

LY573144 Page 67of 7421.APPENDIX 6. Protocol Amendment History
Protocol H8H-CD-LAHL/COL MIG-305 [AnOpen -label, Long -term, Safety Study ofLasmiditan
(200 mgand 100 mg) intheAcute Treatment ofMigraine] has been amended.  The new 
protocol is indicated by [CONTACT_61504] (D)/V4 and will be used to conduct the study in place of any 
preceding version of the protocol.
The rationale for the amendment include the following:
As part of the lasmiditan clinical development process, Lilly reviewed the totality of the 
lasmiditan data, including the recently concluded Study LAIF that assessed duration of 
driving impairment at a maximum lasmiditan dose of 200 mg.  In light of the lack of 
driving study data on potential impairment at doses above 200 mg, Lilly has determined 
that the maximum permitted dose in 24 hours will be 200 mg across the lasmiditan 
clinical development program.  Therefore, patients in this study will be instructed to no 
longer take a sec ond dose of lasmiditan 200 mg in a 24 -hour period.   
While a second dose of lasmiditan 100 mg will continue to be permitted, pooled results 
of prior studies do not provide clear evidence of clinical benefit when a second dose is 
taken for rescue.  However, there is some evidence that a second dose of 100 mg could 
be effective for headache recurrence (the pain goes away completely and later returns).  
Therefore the study is limiting second dose with lasmiditan 100 mg to use for recurrence 
only.
The re-dispen sing of unused study drug is no longer allowed, and therefore language 
pertaining to re -dispensing has been deleted.
As lasmiditan was associated with driving impairment in a study of healthy volunteers on 
a computer -based driving simulator, language was updated to indicate patients should 
restrict their driving, operation of heavy machinery, or other similar activities after taking 
study drug as described in the ICF.
As the standard Lilly hepatic monitoring language and tests were omitted from the study 
when the protocol was previously updated, these have been included in order to 
effectively assess abnormalities pertaining to hepatic laboratory analytes .
Clarification to the schedule of activities footnote was made to indicate that repeat and/or 
additional laboratory testing may be necessary if clinically significant laboratory results 
are obtained.
The overall changes and rationale for the changes made to this protocol are described in the 
following table:

…
Subjects will be asked to treat all migraine attacks with study drug on an outpatient basis for up 
to 12 months.  Each patient’s study participation will consist of a screening visit (Visit 1) and a 
treatment period of up to [ADDRESS_551473] will treat all migraine attacks with 
either lasmiditan 200 mg or lasmiditan 100 mg (with a second dose of stud y drug permitted 
between 2 and 24 hours (h) for rescue or recurrence of migraine only for subjects randomized to 
lasmiditan 100 mg ). 
…
Subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio, to receive lasmiditan 100 mg (L100 mg) or 
lasmiditan 200 mg (L200 mg) . Subjects randomized to lasmiditan 100 mg will be allowed to take 
a second dose of their assigned treatment study drug if needed for rescue or recurrence of 
migraine.
Treatment Period : Subjects will be asked to use lasmiditan as the first treatment for each new 
migraine attack within [ADDRESS_551474] 2 
hours after dosing with study drug and completing the 2 hour assessments. If the migrai ne 
(headache pain) does not respond at [ADDRESS_551475] dose as long as no other rescue medication has been used. If the 
migraine does respond swithin 2 hours (headache becomes pain free) but then recurs after [ADDRESS_551476] their response to a second 
dose, taken for either rescue or recurrence, for 48 h ours in the electronic diary. The total time 
for recording response to study drug is up to 72 hours depending on whether or not a second 
dose of study drug is used (for subjects randomized to lasmiditan 100 mg ). Subjects using an 
alternate medication other than a second dose of study drug for the treatment of migraine 
rescue or recurrence will report the use of medication and continue to record their responses in 
the electronic diary up to the 48 hour timepoint.

All doses of lasmiditan were associated with driving impairment in a study of healthy volunteers 
on a c omputer -based driving simulator. Patients should restri ct their driving, operation of heavy
machinery, or other similar activities after taking study drug,as described in the informed 
consent form (ICF). Since somnolence, dizziness and fatigue have been reported with study 
drug administration, patients partici pating in this study will be advised not to drive or operate 
machinery after taking treatment until they know how they will react to lasmiditan.
Rescue medication (other than study drug) will be permitted after completion of the 2 hour 
assessments if themigraine does not respond (subject is not headache pain free).  A second 
dose of randomized study drug may be taken up to [ADDRESS_551477] dose as long as no 
other rescue medication has been used.

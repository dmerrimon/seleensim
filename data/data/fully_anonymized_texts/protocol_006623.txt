Zoe Diana Draelos, MD  1. PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  Title of Study: Evaluation of the Safety and Efficacy of an Acne Treatment Device Study Period: [ADDRESS_290410] Device and Application Instructions: ZIIP Device (active) -[ADDRESS_290411] current, applied 3 days per week on non-consecutive days, on all areas afflicted by [CONTACT_239391]: 1. Both silver probes must come in contact [CONTACT_239392]. 2. Slowly make continuous circles with the top probe (the one farthest away from the charging port) over acne within each facial zone. **NOTE: Instructional video will be provided for participants to follow** 3. Treat each facial zone for 1 minute.  Your device will beep and vibrate at the one minute mark to indicate that treatment of that zone is complete.  Only treat the acne zone(s) identified for treatment. 4. After treatment, wipe your device clean with a tissue, being careful to avoid the charging port. Spray the device and a second tissue lightly with rubbing alcohol and wipe again, remaining careful to avoid the charging port. 5. Store safely away from water, moisture or debris.  Ancillary Product and Application Instructions: Electroconductive Media Apply as a thin layer to all facial areas afflicted with acne Objective: The objective of this study is to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of a novel direct current device employed in the treatment of mild to moderate inflammatory acne after 12 weeks of every other day use.  Design:    Male and female subjects will be enrolled in this single-site monadic study to evaluate the effect of a device on acne treatment.  Subjects who sign the consent form and meet all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be enrolled at the baseline visit.  Subjects will be asked to continue use of their self-selected moisturizer, non-medicated cleanser, and sunscreen they have used without difficulty for the prior [ADDRESS_290412] possess mild to moderate acne with 5-30 inflammatory lesions and no nodules/cysts.  At baseline visit, subjects will receive the study acne device to be applied to the areas of the face afflicted by [CONTACT_239393], every other day.  The dermatologist investigator will assess the face for the investigator global acne assessment (IGA) based on the following 5 point ordinal scale: 0=clear, 1=almost clear, 2=mild, 3=moderate, and 4=severe.  In addition, the dermatologist investigator will perform 
  Dermatology Consulting Services, PLLC  PAGE [ADDRESS_290413] investigator will assess the tolerability of the device in terms of peeling, dryness, redness, and swelling on a 5-point ordinal scale (0=none, 1=minimal, 2=mild, 3=moderate, & 4=severe).  The subjects will assess device tolerability in terms of itching, burning, redness, and swelling.  All assessments will be made on a 5-point ordinal scale (0=none, 1=minimal, 2=mild, 3=moderate, & 4=severe).  Subjects will be given their diaries, study device, and electroconductive media and asked to return to the research center in [ADDRESS_290414] diaries will be checked at each return visit for compliance and completion.  Subjects will be re-dispensed electroconductive media as needed at each visit; and the devices will be inspected for continued functionality.  Reminder texts will be sent prior to each visit to encourage compliance.  Subjects will return to the research center at week [ADDRESS_290415] 1 lighting at baseline, week 2, week 4, and week 8, and week 12.  Subjects will be provided with the following device instructions:  1. Begin with clean, dry skin. 2. Inspect your skin and identify which zones of your face have acne. The four facial zones are divided as follows: 1) Upper Left, 2) Upper Right, 3) Lower Left, and 4) Lower Right. The zone(s) identified now will be treated throughout the study. 3. Liberally apply the conductive gel provided to you over each zone which has acne. 4. Turn on your device by [CONTACT_239394]. You will hear one beep. 5. Place the device on your skin. Lights will illuminate under the device when both silver probes come in contact [CONTACT_239395]. Both probes must keep contact [CONTACT_239392]. 6. Slowly make continuous circles with the top probe (the one farthest away from the charging port) over acne within each facial zone. (You may feel a tingling sensation during treatment. That is normal.) 7. Treat each facial zone for 1 minute.  Your device will beep and vibrate at the one minute mark to indicate that treatment of that zone is complete.  Only treat the acne zone(s) identified for treatment. 8. At the end of treatment, your device will beep twice and turn off. 
  Dermatology Consulting Services, PLLC  PAGE [ADDRESS_290416]. 11. Repeat treatment of the original acne zone(s) through the study. Perform treatments every other day for [ADDRESS_290417] acne in the forehead and mouth zones at the start of the study, treat those two zones for every treatment. If additional acne develops on the left cheek later in the study, treat the left cheek zone in addition to the mouth and forehead zones for all remaining treatments  CHARGING: When you see the orange light flashing while using your device, it’s time to charge. To charge, plug in the charging cable provided. The orange light will remain illuminated while charging. You will know that your device is completely charged when the orange light is no longer on.

Zoe Diana Draelos, MD  3. INTRODUCTION Acne is a disease that affects individuals of all ages. 85% of Americans 12-[ADDRESS_290419] acne and epi[INVESTIGATOR_239387] a similar prevalence in other countries.  The etiology of acne is multifaceted, involving abnormal follicular hyperkeratizination, increased sebum production; follicular colonization by C. acnes, and inflammation.  Hyperkeratinization induced microcomedone formation is the first step in acne lesion formation.  As keratinocytes and sebum continue to accumulate, a visible non-inflammatory comedone lesion forms. The continued proliferation of C. acnes within the follicle results in follicular wall rupture and eventual formation of an inflammatory papule or pustule.  Successful treatment of acne involves interrupting this sequence of events.  This research examines the ability of a novel device to treat acne.  4.

Zoe Diana Draelos, MD  • People with a cardiac pacemaker • People with implanted defibrillators/stimulators • People with electronic implanted devices  If you have any medical concerns, such as a severe medical illness, epi[INVESTIGATOR_63798], or recent facial surgery, please consult your doctor before using ZIIP.  Electronic monitoring equipment (such as ECG monitors and ECG alarms) may not operate properly when a ZIIP device is in use.  Stimulation should not be applied over, or in proximity to cancerous lesions, or applied over swollen, infected, or inflamed areas or skin eruptions, e.g., phlebitis, thrombophlebitis, broken capi[INVESTIGATOR_11037], varicose veins, etc. Men should shave before use as hair can interfere with the conductivity of the electrodes. Facial area under a beard or mustache cannot be treated.  Do not apply stimulation across your chest as the introduction of electrical current into the chest may cause rhythm disturbances to your heart, which could be lethal.  The long-term effects of stimulation are not known.   10.[ADDRESS_290435] ADMINISTRATION Subjects will use the acne device for applied 3 days per week on non-consecutive days, on all facial zones afflicted by [CONTACT_76523].  The electroconductive media will be applied to the face prior to the use of the device.  The following instructions will be provided: 1. Both silver probes must come in contact [CONTACT_239392]. 2. Slowly make continuous circles with the top probe (the one farthest away from the charging port) over acne within each facial zone. **NOTE: Instructional video will be provided for participants to follow** 3. Treat each facial zone for 1 minute.  Your device will beep and vibrate at the one minute mark to indicate that treatment of that zone is complete.  Only treat the acne zone(s) identified for treatment. 4. After treatment, wipe your device clean with a tissue, being careful to avoid the charging port. Spray the device and a second tissue lightly with rubbing alcohol and wipe again, remaining careful to avoid the charging port. 5. Store safely away from water, moisture or debris.    10.[ADDRESS_290436] number/initials, and the initials and date of the person dispensing and receiving the returned study product will be documented on this form.   10.[ADDRESS_290437] medical occurrence (sign, symptom or laboratory finding), regardless of severity and whether or not attributed to the study product.  The investigator/coordinator will report all adverse experiences (AEs) that occur throughout the study.  All AEs will be recorded in the appropriate AE log.  The report will include: date of onset, a description of the AE, severity, seriousness, action taken, relationship to the study drug, outcome of the event, and date of resolution.  11.2.1 ASSESSMENT OF SEVERITY The intensity or severity of an AE is characterized as: Mild: AE which is easily tolerated. Moderate: AE sufficiently discomforting to interfere with daily activity. Severe: AE which prevents normal daily activities.  Subjects who are withdrawn from the study due to any AE will be followed by [CONTACT_239398].  The investigator will summarize and document all information relating to the AE and follow up.  11.2.[ADDRESS_290438] The relationship is characterized as: 
  Dermatology Consulting Services, PLLC  PAGE [ADDRESS_290439] is unknown; however, a relationship between study product and experience cannot be ruled out.   Probable - there is a reasonable temporal relationship between the use of the study product and the adverse experience.  Based upon the investigator’s clinical experience, the association of the event with the study product seems likely. Definite - The AE occurs following the application of the study product and it cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_239399]’s clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the subject.  It disappears or decreases upon discontinuation of the study product and reappears on a re-challenge of the study product.  11.3 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS Definition:  An SAE is defined as any adverse experience occurring that results in any of the following outcomes:    1. death  2. immediately life-threatening illness 3. hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] ( > 24 hours) or prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 4. a persistent or significant disability 5. a congenital anomaly/birth defect 6. “other” important medical event   These are not anticipated, however, should an SAE occur, the primary investigator (Zoe Diana Draelos, MD) will immediately notify the sponsor.  The sponsor will provide instructions as to how to report the SAE to the FDA.  12. STATISTICAL METHODS  The statistical evaluation will be performed by [CONTACT_239400].  Along with descriptive statistics (means, standard deviations and percentages), investigator and subject ordinal nonparametric data will be analyzed using the Wilcoxon signed rank test.  Acne lesion counts will be assessed using a Student t test.  Change will be considered significant at a p value of less than or equal to 0.05.   12.1 SAMPLE SIZE RATIONALE A sample size of 50 study subjects was chosen by [CONTACT_4530].

Zoe Diana Draelos, MD  12.2 SIGNIFICANCE LEVEL Significance is defined at the p<0.[ADDRESS_290440].  The safety endpoint is the absence of significant adverse reactions.  12.5 EFFICACY ASSESSMENT  The efficacy endpoint is the investigator assessed improvement in investigator global assessment (IGA) after [ADDRESS_290441]’s signed informed consent must be kept on file by [CONTACT_239401]’ inspection at any time.  A copy of the signed and dated consent form will be given to the subject.  13.[ADDRESS_290442] (IRB) The study will be submitted to an IRB selected by [CONTACT_239402].  13.[ADDRESS_290443]’s privacy and, therefore, only a subject identification number and subject initials will identify all subject data.  However, in compliance with federal guidelines regarding the monitoring of clinical studies and in fulfillment of his/her obligations to the Sponsor, it is required that the Investigator permit the study monitor and/or FDA representative 
  Dermatology Consulting Services, PLLC  PAGE [ADDRESS_290444]’s medical record that is directly related to the study.  This shall include all study relevant documentation including subject medical histories to verify eligibility, laboratory test result reports to verify transcription accuracy, admission/discharge summaries for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_200100], and autopsy reports for deaths occurring during the study.  As part of the required content of informed consent, the subject must be informed that his/her medical chart may be reviewed by [CONTACT_456], the Sponsor’s authorized representative, or a representative of the FDA.  Should access to the medical record require a separate waiver or authorization, it is the investigator’s responsibility to obtain such permission from the subject in writing before the subject is entered into the study.  All subjects will sign a HIPAA document as part of the informed consent.  14. DOCUMENTATION 14.[ADDRESS_290445] be received: a) Sponsor approval of study b) Current curriculum vitae of the Investigators c) Copy of Principal Investigator’s Medical license d) A signed copy of the protocol Investigator’s Agreement page e) Original Non-Disclosure Agreement f) Signed Budget Agreement g) Approved FDA Investigational Device Exemption  14.[ADDRESS_290446] two years following final approval of the drug and/or notification from the sponsor.

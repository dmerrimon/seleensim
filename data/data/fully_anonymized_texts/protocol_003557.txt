Planned  Approximately 89 subjects with PD P will be screened and 53  subjects 
are expected to be enrolled, assuming a screen failure rate of 40%. 
Approximately 42 subjects are expected to complete the study, assuming a 20% drop- out rate.  
Test Product, Dose, 
and Administration  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_4256] 34 mg (provided as 1×34 mg capsule ), administered 
orally, once daily 
Study Design  This study will be conducted as a 16-week, multi -center, single -arm, 
open- label  study. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_4256] (ACP-103) will be administered at a 
dose of [ADDRESS_1077195] 3 periods: 
• Screening period (3-35 days)  
• Treatment period ( 16 weeks)  
• Safety follow-up period (30 [+4] days) 
The study will be conducted on an outpatient basis with visits performed  at Screening , Baseline (Week 0), Week 2 , Week 4, Week 8 , 
Week 12 , Week 16 (end of Treatment Period) and  Follow-up ( at least 
[ADDRESS_1077196] dose of study drug). 
Screening Period (3 -35 Days) 
During the screening period, subjects will be assessed for study eligibility and prohibited medications will be discontinued. 
Investigators should not withdraw a subject’s prohibited medication for 
the purpose of enrolling them into the study. Medications should be discontinued only if it is deemed clinically appropriate to do so and in consultation with the treating physician. 
Treatment  Period ( 16 Weeks)  
The Baseline visit ( Week 0 ) may occur as soon as screening 
procedures are completed and subject eligibility has been confirmed. Treatment with  pi[INVESTIGATOR_4256] 34 mg once daily (QD) will begin on the 
morning of the day after the Baseline visit. Additional a ssessments will 
be conducted at Week 2 , Week 4, Week 8, Week 12 , Week 16  (end of 
treatment [EOT])/ early termination [ ET]). Subjects who are withdrawn 
will not be replaced.  
Safety Follow- up Period ( 30-34 Days)

The pri mary efficacy endpoint, change from baseline to Week 16 in the 
mFSQ total score, will be evaluated using a mixed- effects model for 
repeated measures (MMRM). The response variable is the change from Baseline to Weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16 and the fixed  effects i nclude visit 
(Weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16), corresponding Baseline score, and the Baseline score -by-visit interaction.  
Summary statistics for the mFSQ total score (observed and change 
from Baseline), least -squares (LS) means and the corresponding 95% 
confidence interval will be presented.

1.[ADDRESS_1077220] Parkinson’s disease (PD) ( Parkinson’s Disease 
Foundation 2019). Parkinson’s disease is a synucleinopathy resulting in progressive 
neurodegeneration marked by [CONTACT_783400]- motor symptoms including 
psychosis. More than 50% of patients with PD  have psychosis at some time. Psychosis 
affects up to 75% of patients with Parkinson’s disease dementia, and symptoms are more 
intractable in this group. Such psychosis is expressed primarily as hallucinations and 
delusions, which can cause great distress for patients and their caregivers. These epi[INVESTIGATOR_783377] a major  challenge for treatment and care, increase the likelihood of placement in 
nursing homes, and are associated with increased mortality ( Aarsland et al. 2001;

Alzheimer’s disease agitation, Alzheimer’s disease psychosis (ADP) and depression in PD, 
and studies are ongoing in schizophrenia, m ajor depressive disorder, and dementia related 
psychosis. The clinical program for PDP is reviewed below as the study population (elderly

1.3.1 Parkinson’s Disease Psychosis Program 
The scope of the development program for pi[INVESTIGATOR_387343]. At the time of approval, 616 mostly older, late- stage PDP subjects had been evaluated in 
16 countries over a span of >10 years. Clinically meaningful efficacy was established in Study ACP -103-020, a 6- week , placebo-controlled Phase 3 study ( Cummings et al. 2014). 
This efficacy was supported by [CONTACT_387406]-term Phase 2b/[ADDRESS_1077222] frequently reported treatment -emergent 
adverse events (TEAEs) were in  the central nervous system (CNS), gastrointestinal, and 
psychiatric systems. Most events were mild to moderate in intensity. The most common 
CNS  TEAEs included dizziness (including post ural), headache, and somnolence 
(drowsiness). Common gastrointestinal disturbances included dyspepsia, nausea, 
constipation, and vomiting. Severe nausea and vomiting were dose limiting in a few cases. Reported psychiatric conditions included agitation, insomnia, and confusional state.

thorough QT study with doses of pi[INVESTIGATOR_149662] 17 to 68 mg. In the Phase 3 PDP 
program, an average prolongation of approximately 5 to 8 ms was observed with 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_4256] 34 mg.

1.4 Study Rationale 
Onset and progression of disability are major factors in the diagnosis and management of PD 
(Shulman 2010; Shulman et al. 2008). The World Health Organization (WHO) defines 
disability as “any restriction or lack of ability to perform an activity within the range 
considered normal for a human being due to an impairment”  (World Health Organization 
1980). In this context, “disability” is an umbrella term for the negative aspects of the 
interaction between an individual with a health condition and environmental and personal factors, in contrast to “functioning,” an umbrella term for the positive aspects of this 
interaction ( World Health Organization 2001). Accurate assessment of disability is important 
given that the onset of functional limi tations triggers changes in clinical management, 
including adjustment of medications or referral for deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) surgery. 
Neurological examination of PD-related impairments, including tremor, bradykinesia, gait, 
and cognitive function, does not provide adequate insight into the capacity for performance of daily activities because there is a broad range of compensato ry strategies and support 
based on socioeconomic status. Patient insight into daily function also varies with PD 
patients tending to understate their level of disability  (Shulman et al. 2006). Therefore, 
integrating  data from multiple sources (examination,  disability  assessment, and patient and 
caregiver reports)  is important.  
In a 6 week study evaluating pi[INVESTIGATOR_783383]  (Cummings et al. 2014), a 
decrease from baseline in the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale ( UPDRS ) Parts II+III 
score was observed across both placebo and pi[INVESTIGATOR_783384] (pi[INVESTIGATOR_783385]) was 0.29 (95% confidence interval [ CI], -2.14 to 
2.72). Since the upper limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for the treatment differ ence was ≤5, 
non-inferiority of pi[INVESTIGATOR_4256] [ADDRESS_1077223]-baseline UPDRS was only measured once on Day 43, and this variable 
was considered a measure of safety and function r ather than efficacy. These assessments were 
to be conducted in the “on” state. In addition it is  known that the UPDRS measurements do 
not provide adequate insight into the capacity for performance of daily activities due to broad 
range of compensatory stra tegies  (Shulman et al. 2006).  
Therefore an activities of daily living ( ADL ) study in patients with PDP  is needed to evaluate 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_783386], and patient and

more patients and to improve the value of trial results  (Beyer -Westendorf et al. 2011). In a 
systematic review , it was noted that  most ADL studies were performed over a minimum of 
3 months with many lasting for 12 months ( Al Thomali et al. 2017). The rationale for the 
current study for [ADDRESS_1077224] on ADL  scales in patients experiencing PDP. 
The currently approved dose for the treatment of PDP of 34 mg per day is being utilized in this study. 
1.5 Benefit/Risk Assessment  
In this open- label study, pi[INVESTIGATOR_783387], PDP . Hence,  
the benefit/risk for the patients is as would be expected from the approved prescribing 
information label  for NUPLAZID (pi[INVESTIGATOR_4256]) ( Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc. 2020) . There 
is no placebo group. The study will examine a range of symptoms in order to explore the 
correlation of the benefit on psychosis with functional improvement.

3 STUDY DESCRIPTION 
3.1 Overview of Study Design 
This study will be conducted as a 16-week, multi- center, s ingle-arm, open-label study. 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_4256] (ACP -103) will be administered at a dose of 34 mg to approximately 
50 subjects with  PDP . Approximately 89 subjects with PDP will be screened and 53 subjects 
are expected to be enrolled, assuming a screen failure rate of 40%. Approximately 42 subjects 
are expected to complet e the study, assuming a 20% drop-out rate.  Approximately 25 sites in 
the US will participate in this study.  
The duration of participation for individual study subjects will be up to 26 weeks, consisting 
of the following 3 periods ( Figure S–1): 
• Screening period (3-35 days)  
• Treatment period (16 weeks) 
• Safety follow-up period (30-34 days). 
The study will be conducted on an outpatient basis with visits performed at Screening, Baseline (Week 0), Week 2, Week 4, Week 8, W eek 12, Week 16 (end of Treatment Period) 
and Follow-up (at least [ADDRESS_1077225] dose of study drug). 
The study start date is defined as the date the first subject is enrolled, which is the baseline 
visit date for the first su bject.  The primary completion date is the last date that subject data 
was collected for the primary outcome measure.  The study completion date is defined  as the 
last date that subject data was collected , which includes the safety follow-up telephone call 
visit.  
Procedures for when  a subject is lost to follow -up are provided in Section 4.5.

6.1 Screening  Assessments 
6.1.1 Mini -Mental State  Examination 
The MMSE is a brief 30 -point questionnaire that is used to quantitatively assess cognition 
(Folstein et al. 1975). The MMSE includes simple questions and problems in a number of 
areas: the time and place of testing, repeating lists of words, a rithmetic, language use and 
comprehension, and copying a drawing. Only subtraction of serial 7s will be used in this study; spelling the word ‘world’ backwards option should not be used. The MMSE is being used in this study to screen for cognitive impairment. 
6.1.2 Neuropsychiatric Inventory  
The NPI [INVESTIGATOR_783394] ( Cummings et al. 
1994). The original NPI [INVESTIGATOR_387381] 10 neuropsychiatric disturbances common in dementia: 
delusions, hallucinations, agitation, dysphoria, anxiety, apathy, irritability, euphoria, 
disinhibition, and aberrant motor behavior. Two other domains, nighttime behavior 
disturbances and appetite and eating abnormalities, were subsequently added to the NPI (Cummings 1997).  
Study: ACP -103-063  Final Version: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protocol Amend ment 1   Date: 20 May 20 21 
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 41 of 73 At Screening  (Visit 1) and Baseline (Visit 2 ), the degree of the patient’s neuropsychiatric 
symptoms will be evaluated using two  of the domains of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory 
(NPI), Domain A (Delusions) and  Domain B (Hallucinations). 
6.2 Efficacy Assessments  
All scales should be conducte d in the “on” state.   
6.2.1 Functional Status Questionnaire  
The Functional Status Questionnaire is a self -administered questionnaire that provides an 
assessme nt in ambulatory patients of physical, psychological, social, and role function 
(Jette et al. 1986). It comprises 34 core items that produce 6 summary scale scores :  
• Basic activities of daily living (eating, dressing, bathing, moving in and out of bed or 
chair, walking indoors e.g., in the home)  
• Intermediate activities of daily living  (walking several blocks; walking one block or 
climbing one flight of stairs; house cleaning, yard work, or home maintenance; doing 
errands e.g., grocery shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]; driving a car or using public transportation; doing vigorous activities e.g., running, lifting heavy objects , participating in strenuous 
sports) 
• Psychological function and mental health (been a very nervous person ; felt calm and 
peaceful; felt downhearted and blue; be en a happy person; fe lt so down in the dumps 
that nothing could cheer you up) 
• Social/role function  
o Work performance ( done as much work as others in similar  jobs, worked  
for short periods or taking frequent rests because of your health, work ed 
your regular number of hours, done your job as carefully and accurately as others with similar jobs,  work ed at your usual job but with some changes 
because of your health, feared  losing your job because of your health)  
o Social activity (h ad difficulty  visiting with relatives an d friends, had 
difficulty participating in community activities [e.g., religious services, social activities, volunteer work ], had difficulty  taking care of other people 
[e.g., family members]) 
o Quality of interaction (isolated yourself from people around you, acted 
affectionate toward others, acted irritable toward those around you, made 
unreasonable demands on family and friends, gotten along well with other 
people).

 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 42 of 73 It also includes 6 single- item scores (work situation ; days per month in bed due to illness or 
injury; days per month when illness injury reduced activities normally performed for half a 
day or more ; satisfaction with sexual relationships; satisfaction with own health; frequency of 
social interaction).  
6.2.2 Schwab and Engla nd A ctivities of Daily Living  Scale (Caregiver and Patient 
Version)  
The Schwab & England ADL Scale is widely used in PD. It is rated by [CONTACT_13922], patients, 
or staff using a 0% to 100% scale with 10% intervals, where 100% is “Completely independent. Unawa re of difficulty” and 0% is “Vegetative functions...Bedridden” 
(Schwab  and England 1969; McRae et al. 2000 ). 
6.2.3 Movement Disorders Society – Unified Parkinson’ s Disease Rating Scale Parts I 
and II (Caregiver and Patient Version)  
The MDS -UPDRS is a comprehensive battery of motor and behavioral indices derived from 
the Columbia Scale ( Fahn et al. 1987). The MDS -UPDRS Parts I and II will be used to assess 
Non-Motor Aspects of Experiences in Daily Living (nM- EDL)  (Part I) and Motor Aspects of 
Experience of Daily Living (M- EDL)  (Part II) and consist of 13 items  each  (Goetz et al. 
2008).  
Part I has two components: Part IA concerns a number of behaviors that are assessed by [CONTACT_783404], and Part IB is 
completed by [CONTACT_292792], but independently of the Investigator. These sections can, however, be reviewed by [CONTACT_783405], and the rater can help explain any perceived ambiguities. Part II is designed to be a self-administered questionnaire like Part IB, but can be reviewed 
by [CONTACT_783406].  
6.2.4 Clinical Global Impression – Improvement - Hallucinations  and Del usions  
The CGI -I is a clinician -rated, [ADDRESS_1077244]’s symptoms at the time of assessment, relative to the symptoms at Baseline 
(Guy 1976).  Severity ratings should be based on the behavioral domains of clinical concern , 
namely hallucinations and delusions. 
6.2.5 Clinical Global Impression – Severity - Hallucinations and Delusions  
The CGI –S scale is a clinician -rated, [ADDRESS_1077245]’s neuropsychiatric symptoms at the time of assessment using the Investigator’s 
judgment and past experience with subjects who have the same disorder (Guy 1976). 
Study: ACP -103-063  Final Version: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protocol Amend ment 1   Date: [ADDRESS_1077246], easy to use scale that is intuitively understandable to subjects and clinicians. 
The PGI -I asks the patient to rate their symptoms now, as compared with how it was at 
Baseline before beginning treatment, ranging from 1=very much better to 7=very much worse. Severity ratings should be based on the behavioral domains of clinical concern, namely hallucinations and delusions. 
6.2.7 Virtual Reality Functional Capacity Assessment Tool  
The VRFCAT is a tablet -based assessment that simulates key  instrumental activities of daily 
living ( iADL s) in a realistic and interactive virtual environment. With demonstrated 
sensitivity to basic functional capacity deficits, the VRFCAT was developed to improve 
clinical trials by [CONTACT_783407]’ everyday lives 
(Ruse et al . 2014). The brief  (VRFCAT shorte ned-list) version will be utilized for this study.  
6.2.8 Caregiver Strain  Index  
The Caregiver Strain Index (CSI) is a tool that can be used to quickly identify families with potential caregiving concerns. It is a 13- question tool that measures strain related to  care 
provision. There is at least one item for each of the following major domains: Employment, Financial, Physical, Social and Time. Positive responses to seven or more items on the index indicate a greater level of strain. This instrument can be used to  assess individuals of any age 
who have assumed the role of caregiver for an older adult ( Robinson 1983; Pe arlin et al. 
1990).   
6.2.9 Neuropsychiatric Inventory  – Questionnai re Nighttime  Behavior Domain  
The NPI -Q was developed and cross-validated with the standard NPI [INVESTIGATOR_506055] a brief 
assessment of neuropsychiatric symptomatology ( Kaufer et al. 2000). The NPI -Q is a 
self-administered questionnaire completed by [CONTACT_783408]. 
Of the 12 domains in the full questionnaire, only the Nighttime Behavior domain will be completed by [CONTACT_783409]. 
6.2.10 Geriatric Depression Scale (Short Form)  
The Geriatric Depression Scale ( GDS ) (Short Form) may be used with healthy, medically ill 
and mild to moderately cognitively impaired older adults. It has been extensively used in 
community, acute care, and long-term care settings. The GDS was found to have a 92% 
sensitivity and an 89% specificity when evaluated against diagnostic criteria. The validity and 
Study: ACP -103-063  Final Version: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protocol Amend ment 1   Date: [ADDRESS_1077247] been supported through both clinical practice and research. In a 
validation study comparing the Long and Short Forms of the GDS for self-rating of 
symptoms of depression, both were successful in differentiating depressed from non-
depressed ad ults with a high correlation (r = 0.84, p <0.001) ( Sheikh and Yesavage 1986; 
Yesavage et al. 1983;  Stanford/V A/NIA Aging Clinical Resource Center, 2019) . 
6.3 Safety Assessments  
6.3.1 Columbia -Suicide Sev erity Rating Scale 
The C -SSRS monitors changes in suicidal thinking and behavior over time, in order to 
determine risk ( Posner et al. 2011). The following four constructs are measured: the severity 
of ideation, the intensity of ideation, behavior, and lethality.  
The C -SSRS will be used to assess suicidal ideations and behaviors. The Baseline/Screening 
version will be administered at Visit 1 (Screening), and the “Since Last Visit” version will be administered at all other designated visits. The C -SSRS result s for each subject should be 
reviewed by [CONTACT_783410]. If at any time the C -SSRS results for a given 
subject reveal potential suicidality, then the Investigator should assess the clinical significance of such results. If a clinically sign ificant risk of suicidality is identified for a 
subject, then the Investigator should discontinue the subject and implement appropriate 
treatment ( Section  4.4).  
This assessment is to be completed at all clinic visits.  
6.3.2 Physical Examinations 
A physical examination including neurological exam (cranial nerves, motor, sensory, reflexes, 
gait, and coordination) will be conducted. 
6.3.[ADDRESS_1077248] has been sitting or supi[INVESTIGATOR_2525] ≥ 3 minutes.  
6.3.4 Height , Weight, and Body Mass Index

 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 45 of 73 6.3.5 Electrocardiograms  
All 12 -lead ECGs will be complete, standardized recordings. All ECGs will be centrally read; 
the interpretation by [CONTACT_783411] c onsidered the official interpretation. Each 
ECG will  be recorded continu ously for 5 minutes.  
The five minutes of ECG data will be converted into a Summary ECG (simulated 10-second 
ECG) for each subject. The summary ECG is created by [CONTACT_783412] a me dian beat for 
each lead based  on all normal, good-quality beats in the lead, using standard methods and 
then linked together with an intervening RR interval equal to the average for the entire 
record. The full ECG will be evaluated algorithmically  and over- read by a cardiologist. The 
over- reading cardiologist will review the entire 5 -minute recording for arrhythmias and , if 
present, will add them to the interpretation of the summary ECG  
The following conditions apply: 
• If the  QTcF value from the ECG done at Screening is prolonged due to an identifiable 
cause, and it is medically appropriate to address that cause, a repeat ECG may be performed during Screening at the discretion of the Medical Monitor. In this case, the 
repeat ECG will be used in determination of subject eligibility.  
• At Ba seline, a subject may be enrolled based on the machine read of the locally 
completed ECG. If the interpretation of the ECG by [CONTACT_650949], the subject will be discontinued from the study, 
but enrollment of the subject will not be considered a protocol deviation. 
The subject must rest in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_21683] 3 minutes before the ECG is obtained. 
ECG tracings (paper or electronic) will be reviewed and interpreted by a qualified clinician. ECG tracings and results (ventricular rate, PR, QRS, QT, QTcF and QTcB intervals) will be 
included and summarized in the subject's study records. 
6.3.6 Laboratory Evaluations 
Clinical laboratory sample collection (including HbA
1c at Screening  only) is encouraged,  but 
not required to be completed under fasting conditions. The laboratory evaluations will 
include, but are not limited to, the following: 
• Clinical chemistry serum tests  
o Sodium (Na), potassium (K), chloride (Cl), phosphorus (P), calcium (Ca), 
magnesium (Mg), carbon dioxide (CO 2), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine 
(CR), uric acid  
 Mg should only be performed at Visit 1 (Screening)

o Lipid panel 
 Total cholesterol,  high-density lipoprotein ( HDL )-cholesterol, trig lycerides, 
low-density lipoprotein ( LDL )-cholesterol, c holesterol/HDL ratio, non- HDL 
cholesterol  
• Pregnancy test  
o A serum  pregnancy test should only be performed at Visit 1  (Table 6–1) for 
women of childbearing potential 
o A urine pregnancy test should be performed at Baseline and all subsequent visits 
(except Visit  3) up to and including EOT  (Table 6–1) for women of child- bearing 
potential  
 If urine cannot be obtained in women of childbearing potential, a serum pregnancy test should be done in its place  
• Hematology tests  
o Complete blood count (CBC) including: 
 White blood cell (WBC) count 
 Complete differential (relative and absolute)

 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 47 of 73 • Urinalysis  
o Blood, RBCs, WBCs, protein, glucose, ketones, specific gravity, pH 
o Reasonable efforts should be made to collect a urine sample from all subjects. 
Where collection of a urine sample proves impractical or impossible (e.g., because 
the subject is in continent), failure to collect a urine sample should be recorded in 
the subject’s CRF, and will not be considered a protocol deviation. 
• Urine toxicity screen  
o Urine toxicity screen will test for controlled substances at screening . The 
following controlled s ubstances may  be tested with a urine toxicity screen 
according to the schedule presented in Table 6–1: a mphetamine , barbiturates, 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], cocaine, methadone, morphine/opi[INVESTIGATOR_858], methampheta mine, 
marijuana (THC), phencyclidine (PCP), ecstasy ( 3,4-methylenedioxy-
methamphetamine  [MDMA ]). Negative drug screens are required for study 
eligibility . 
o Subjects who test positive and have a valid prescription for a controlled substance 
may be retested i f they agree to abstain from the medication for the length of their 
participation in the study. The repeat test, and any other tests, must be negative for 
them to participate in the study.  
Laboratory evaluations will be completed according to the schedule presented in Table 6 –1 
and procedures detailed in the study laboratory manual. Additional safety testing may be performed at the discretion of the Investigator or designee.

7 ADVERSE EVENTS  
7.1 Specification of Safety Parameters  
7.1.1 Definition of Adverse Event  
An AE is defined as “any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical study 
participant, temporal ly associated with the use of study drug, whether or not considered 
related to study drug”. 
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, without any

off-label use, use in combination with another drug) and from any route of administration, 
formulation, or dose, including an overdose. 
A suspected advers e reaction is any A E for which there is a reasonable possibility that the 
drug caused the AE. AEs do not include the following: 
• Stable or intermittent chronic conditions (such as myopia requiring eyeglasses) that are 
present prior to Baseline and do not worsen during the study 
• Medical or surgical procedures (e.g., surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, transfusion). The condition that leads to the procedure is an AE if not present at 
Baseline. 
• Overdose of concomitant medication without any signs or symptoms unless the subject 
is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_115913] 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_120004] (situation where an 
untoward medical occurrence has not occurred)  
• Pregnancy will not be considered an AE, but if it occurs, it will be reported on a pregnancy form  
7.1.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Event  
In addition to the severity rating, each AE will be classified by [CONTACT_5256] “serious” 
or “not serious.” The seriousness of an event will be  defined according to the applicable 
regulations and generally refers to the outcome of an event. An SAE is one that meets one or 
more of the following: 
• Is fatal  
• Is immediately life threatening  
• Results in disability or permanent damage  
• Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• Prolongs existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect (in an offspring) 
• Is medically significant

Definition of Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_508827] a full  admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_431800] . This includes prolongation of an existing inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
Examples of visits to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_149691]: 
• Emergency room visits (that do not result in a full hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063] ) 
• Outp atient surgery  
• Preplanned or elective procedures  
• Protocol procedures  
• Social hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], defined as admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1315] a result of inadequate 
family support or care at the subject’s primary residence  
Definition of Disability or Permanent Damage Disability is defined as a  persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions. Definition of Medically Significant  
Important medical events (medically significant events) that may not result in death, be life 
threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_149693], based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject  or may requi re medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of 
such events are intensive treatment in an em ergency room or at home for allergic 
bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_149694]. 
An SAE may also include any other event that the Investigator or M edical Monitor judges to 
be serious or that suggests a significant hazard, contraindication, side effect, or precaution.

 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 51 of 73 7.2 Classification of an Adverse Event 
7.2.1 Severity of Event  
The severity of each AE will be graded on a 3- point scale and reported in detail as indicated 
on the eCRF:  
• Mild : awareness of sign or symptom but easily tolerated, causing minimal discomfort, 
and not interfering with normal everyday activities 
• Moderate : sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal everyday activities  
• Severe:  incapacitating and/or p reventing normal everyday activities 
7.2.2 Relationship to Study Drug  
The causality of each AE s hould be assessed and classified by [CONTACT_5256] “related” or 
“not related.” An event is considered related  if there is a reasonable possibility that the event 
may have been caused by [CONTACT_95107] (i.e., there are facts, evidence, or 
arguments to suggest possible causation). 
Consider the following when assessing causality: 
• Temporal associations between the agent and the event 
• Response to cessation (de -challenge) or re -challenge 
• Compatibility with known class effect 
• Known effects of concomitant me dications 
• Pre-existing risk factors 
• A plausible mechanism  
• Concurrent illnesses 
[IP_ADDRESS] Duration 
The start and stop dates for AEs will be recorded using the fol lowing criteria: 
• Start : Date of the first epi[INVESTIGATOR_149688]

2-sided  95% CIs , unless stated otherwise. 
Baseline is defined to be the last non-missing value prior to the first dose of study drug. 
9.5.1 Primary  Analyses 
The primary efficacy endpoint, change from baseline to Week 16 in the m FSQ total s core, 
will be evaluated using a mixed -effects model for repeated measures (MMRM). The response 
variable is the change from Baseline to Weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16 and the fixed  effects include 
visit (Weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16), corresponding Baseline score, and th e Baseline score -by-visit 
interaction. The mFSQ total score will be calculated as the unweighted mean of the subscale 
scores  (Basic ADL, Intermediate ADL, Psychological Function, Social Activity and Quality 
of Social Interaction ). The Work Performance  subs cale will be excluded , given the age and 
non-employment status of the intended patient population.   Summary statistics for the mFSQ total score (observed and change from Baseline), least-
squares (LS) means and the corresponding 95% CI  will be presented.  
9.5.2 Secondary Analyses

(Patient and Caregiver), and MDS- UPDRS Part II (Patient and Caregi ver) will be 
summarized usin g an MMRM model similar to that described for the primary analysis, 
except that the Baseline value of the endpoint being analyzed will be included in the model instead of the Baseline m FSQ total score.  
For CGI- I the response var iable is the observed score at Week 16  and the MMRM will 
include fixed effects for visit (Week 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16), Baseline CGI- S score, and Baseline 
CGI-S score-by- visit interaction.  
For PGI -I the response variable is the observed score at Week [ADDRESS_1077262] for visit (Week 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16).

11 QUALITY MANAGEMENT  
11.1 Risk Management  
The Sponsor utilizes the ICH E6 (GCP) Revision 2 risk management approach that includes 
methods to assure and control the quality of the trial proportionate to the risks inherent in the 
trial and the importance of the information collected. The intent is that all aspects of this trial are operationally feasible and that any unnecessary complexity, procedures, and data 
collection are avoided. The Sponsor’s ri sk management approach includes the following 
activities:  
• Critical Process and Data Identification: during protocol development, risks of processes and data that are critical to ensure human subject protection and the 
reliability of trial results  are identified and assessed . 
• Risk Identification: risks to critical trial processes, governing systems, investigational 
product, trial design, data collection, and recording are identified. 
• Risk Evaluation: identified risks are evaluated by [CONTACT_783421]: (a) 
likelihood of occurrence, (b) impact on human subject protection and data integrity, 
and (c) detectability of errors.

 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 62 of 73 • Risk Control: risks that can be reduced (e.g., mitigating) or can be accepted are 
differentiated. Risk mitigation activities are incorporated in protocol design and 
implementation, study plans, training, processes, and other documents governing the oversight and execution of study activities. Where possible, predefined quality 
tolerance li mits are to be defined to identify systematic issues that can impact subject 
safety or data integrity and deviations from the predefined quality tolerance limits will trigger an evaluation and possibly an action. Contingency plans are developed for 
issues with a high risk factor that cannot be avoided.  
• Periodic risk review, communication, and escalation of risk management activities during trial execution and risk outcome reporting in the clinical study report (CSR).

The Sponsor’s or designee’s monitor is responsible for inspecting the eCRFs at regular intervals throughout the study to verify adherence to the protocol; completeness, accuracy, and consistency of the data; and adherence to local regulations on the conduct of clinical research. The monitor should have access to subject medical records and other study- related 
records needed to verify the entries on the eCRFs.  
The Investigator agrees to cooperate with the monitor to ensure that any problems detected in the course of these monitoring visits are resolved. 
In accordance with ICH guidance on GCP and the Sponsor’s audit plans, a certain percentage 
of sites participating in this study will be audited. T hese audits may include a r eview  of site 
facilities (e.g., pharmacy, drug storage areas, and laboratories) and review of study- related 
records may occur in order to evaluate the trial conduct and compliance with the protocol, 
ICH guidance on GCP, and appli cable regulatory requiremen ts. 
The Sponsor’s or designee ’s representatives, regulatory authority inspectors and IRB/ EC 
representatives who obtain direct access to source documents should also respect subject  
confidentiality, taking all reasonable precautions in accordance with appli cable regulatory 
requirements to maintain the confidentiality of subjects’ identities.

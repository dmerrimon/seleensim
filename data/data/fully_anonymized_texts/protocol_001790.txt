Detailed Title A Phase 1/2, randomized, observer -blind, controlled, multi -
center, dose -escalation study  to evaluate safet y, reactogenicit y 
and immunogenicit y of [COMPANY_004] Biologicals’ respi[INVESTIGATOR_489563] (RSV) investigational vaccine based on the RSV viral 
proteins F, N and M2 -1 encoded b y chimpanzee -derived 
adenovector (ChAd155 -RSV) ([COMPANY_004]3389245A), when 
administered intramuscularly according to a 0, 1- month 
schedule to RSV- serop ositive infants aged [ADDRESS_978308] infections (L RTI; bronchiolitis and 
[broncho]pneumonia) associated with respi[INVESTIGATOR_489563] (RSV [subty pes A andB]).
Rationale for the 
study and study 
designRationale for the stud y
GlaxoSmithKline ([COMPANY_004]) Biologicals is developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a new 
investigational RSV vaccine to protect infants from RSV 
diseases. The candidate vaccine is based on the RSV viral 
proteins F, N and M2 -1 encoded b y chimpanzee -derived 
adenovector (ChAd155 -RSV).
The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the safet y, reactogenicity 
and immunogenicit y of this RSV candidate vaccine when first 
administered via intramuscular (IM) injection according t o a 0, 
1-month schedule to RSV -seropositive infants aged 12 to 23 
months.
Rationale for the stud y design
Study  population: The immunogenicit y, safet y and 
reactogenicity of the pediatric candidate RSV vaccine 
(ChAd155-RSV vaccine) has been evaluated in heal thy 
adult subjects aged 18 to 45 y ears (study  201974 [RSV 
PED -001]). The ChAd155- RSV vaccine is being developed 
for the active immunization of infants as from 6 weeks of 
age. To allow age de -escalation from the adult population 
to the targeted population a nd to not enroll and administer 
the ChAd155-RSV vaccine to older children who are 
beyond the age of severe RSV disease and would not 
benefit from this vaccine, the present stud y will be 
performed on RSV -seropositive infants aged 12 to 23 
months, after the safet y profile of the ChAd155- RSV 
vaccine in adults (study  201974 [RSV PED -001; 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]]) was evaluated as satisfactory  by [CONTACT_140954] (IDMC). The 
present stud y will provide critical information on the safet y 
and immunogenicit y profile of the ChAd155 -RSV vaccine 
before a subsequent trial in seronegative infants.

Protocol Amendment 4 Final
10-DEC-2017 10Control: A placebo group is included as a control for the 
reactogenicity , the safety and the immunogenicity  
assessments.
Study  blinding: Given the different storage conditions of 
the investigational RSV vaccine and placebo, double 
blinding is not possible and the study  will be conducted in 
an observer -blind manner (Amended 10 Dec ember 2017) .
When all data up to Day  60 are available, a statistical 
analysis will be perf ormed. This analy sis may  lead to the 
unblinding of some subjects. As a consequence, after Day  
60, the study  cannot be considered as observer -blind, but 
will be conducted in a single -blind manner, with subjects’ 
parent(s)/ legally  acceptable representative (LAR[ s]) 
remaining blinded up to study  end (Day  730). The 
investigators will not have access to the treatment 
allocation up to study  end (Day  730).
Regimen, dose and route of administration: A vaccination 
regimen based on two IM injections (in the deltoid [if the 
muscle size is adequate; otherwise injections might be done 
in the anterolateral thigh]) of 5 x 109, 1.5 x 1010, or 5 x 1010
viral particles (vp) of the ChAd155- RSV vaccine 
administered according to a 0, 1- month schedule (4 -week 
interval between va ccinations) will be evaluated in this 
study .
The 4 -week interval regimen has been tested in pre -clinical 
models and results from a bovine RSV challenge model in 
which seronegative, colostrum- restricted newborn calves 
were vaccinated with two doses of 5 x 1010vp ChAd155 -
RSV, four weeks apart showed that dose regimen was 
immunogenic and protected calves from bovine RSV 
disease and infection and was not associated to pulmonary  
pathology .
A Phase I clinical trial evaluated a simian adenoviral 
vector -based RSV vaccine with the same insert (PanAd3 -
RSV) [ RSV001 I nterim Study  Report , 2014]. Data from 
this trial, with 42 subjects, showed that a vaccination 
regimen based on two IM injections, separated by [CONTACT_717543], was safe and immunogenic.
Similar to the Phase I  adult study  (201974 [RSV PED -
001]), the current stud y is designed in a staggered manner 
to allow dose escalation from 5 x 109vp (1 -log lower dose) 
to [ADDRESS_978309] time in pediatric population 
study  to allow a more progressive escalation of the dose -
related risk in this vulnerable population.

10-DEC-2017 11Staggered design with 3 steps: The investigational 
ChAd155- RSV vaccine will be administered f or the first 
time in a pediatric population therefore a three- step 
staggered design will be used to allow dose escalation of 
three dose levels and ensure maximum safety  of the 
participating infants.
The investigational ChAd155- RSV vaccine will be 
administe red to up to 48 subjects in total. As a control, up 
to 48 subjects will be vaccinated with placebo across the 
three steps (Amended 10 Dec ember 2017) .
Vaccination will be limited to a maximum of 10 infants per 
day. In the same investigational center, infant s will be 
vaccinated sequentiall y, separated b y a minimum interval 
of 60 minutes to allow monitoring of an y acute events (e.g. 
hypersensitivity  reaction). In addition, to monitor delay ed 
potential reactions following vaccination, there will be a 
48-hour observation period following Dose [ADDRESS_978310] eight infants (corresponding to 
three to five ChAd155 -RSV vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]) in each 
Step (1, 2, and 3) before continuing vaccination of more 
infants (i.e. from the ninth infant). From the ninth infant, 
infants will be vaccinated sequentially , separated by  a 
minimum interval of 60 minutes. Refer to the study  
procedures manual (SPM) for more details about the 48-
hour observation period after the first eight subjects 
vaccinated in each Step.
In Step 1 , between a maximum of 32to a minimum of 
16 RSV -seropositive infants will receive two doses of 
either low dose ChAd155- RSV vaccine (5 x 109vp 
[RSV -Ld]; 0.5 mL) or placebo (0.5 mL), according to 
their random assignment (Amended 10 Dec ember
2017) .
In Step 2 , between a maximum of 32to a minimum of 
16RSV -seropositive infants will receive two doses of 
either middle dose ChAd155 -RSV vaccine (1.5 x 1010
vp [RSV -Md]; 0.15 mL ) or placebo (0.15 mL), 
according to their random assignment (Amended 10
December 2017) .
In Step 3 , 32RSV -seropositive infants will receive two 
doses of either high dose ChAd155- RSV vaccine (5 x 
1010vp [RSV -Hd]; 0.5 mL) or placebo (0.5 mL), 
according to their random assignment.
An internal Safet y Review Committee (iSRC) will review 
all accumulating safety  data three weeks after the start of 
vaccination and then about every  three weeks until the 
IDMC has reviewed all safet y data up to 30 day s after

10-DEC-2017 12administration of Dose 2 in Step 3 (i.e. Day  60).
The IDMC will review accumulating reactogenicity  and 
safet y data monthl y throughout the period of vaccination 
(up to 30 day s after administration of Dose 2 in Step 3, i.e. 
Day 60). The IDMC will also review incidence of all 
serious advers e events (SAEs) and incidence of RSV-
respi[INVESTIGATOR_36115] (RTI), RSV -LRTI, RSV -severe 
LRTI and RSV -RTIleading to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_717478] .
Both iSRC a nd IDMC will receive critical safet y data (i.e. 
SAEs and adverse events of specific interest) within 48 
hours upon [COMPANY_004] becoming aware of it.
The iSRC and I DMC will determine whether any of the 
predefined study  holding rules are met. If this is the case, 
vaccination in the stud y will be immediately  put on hold. 
At any  time, the IDMC may  recommend to the sponsor to 
suspend the enrolment to the study  and/or vaccination 
based on the safet y data regularl y arising in this study.
Dose escalation will proceed after administration of the 
vaccine to all subjects in the previous step if no significant 
safet y concern is detected by  [CONTACT_717544] y data. The IDMC may 
recommend for dose escalation to proceed in theabsence 
of a conc ern based on safety  data review o na minimum 
of 16 subjects completing dose 2. The IDMC may 
recommend that based on the evolving safety profile, 
sufficient information has been accumulated to allow 
safe progression to the next sequential dose level .Thus ,
the number of subjects enrolled to the low and mid dose is 
between 16 and 32 subjects but the number of subjects 
enrolled to the high dose remains fixed at 32 subjects.
(Amended 10 Dec ember 2017)
Additionally , the IDMC will perform a review when all 
safet y data up to 30 day s after administration of Dose 2 in 
Step 3 (i.e. Day  60) are available.

Adverse event: Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation subject, temporally associated with the use 
of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related 
to the medicinal product. 
An adverse event (AE) can therefore be an y unfavorable
and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory  
finding), s ymptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) 
temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal product. 
For marketed medicinal products, this also includes 
failure to produce expected benefits (i.e . lack of efficacy ), 
abuse or misuse.
Blinding: A procedure in which one or more parties to the trial are 
kept unaware of the treatment assignment in order to

of quality  will appropriate personnel be unblinded or 
when required in case of a serious adverse event. In a 
single -blind study , the investigator and/or his staff are 
aware of the treatment assignment but the subject is not. 
In an observer -blind study , the subject and the site and 
sponsor personnel involved in the clinical evaluation of 
the subjects are blinded while other study  personnel may  
be aware of the treatment assignment (s ee Section 6.3for 
details on observer -blinded studies) .

1.1. Background
1.1.1. RSV disease burden
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_227899] (RSV) is a ribonucleic acid virus of which two antigenically  
distinct subgroups exist, referred to as RSV -A and RSV -B [Borchers , 2013]. RSV is a 
highl y contagious human pathogen that causes respi[INVESTIGATOR_6014] (RTI )in people 
of all ages.
During the first year of life, 50- 70% of infants are infected with RSV and essentially  all 
children have had an RSV infection b y their second birthday . The risk for severe 
RSV -associated lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_36115] ( LRTI)is highest in infants below 
6months of age and is a leading cause for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. I t is esti mated that on average 
31 per 1000 children below 6 months of age are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_489583]- associated severe 
LRTI Boyce, 2000; Deshpande , 2003; Hall , 2009; Holman, 2004; Iwane, 2004; 
Paramore , 2004; Vicente , 2003 . 50-70% of these hospi[INVESTIGATOR_717487] Boyce, 2000; 
García , 2010; Hall, 2009; Rietveld, 2004 . For human immunodeficie ncy virus ( HIV)-
infected children, the incidence rate of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_717488] -associated LRTI  was 
reported to be 2.5 -to5-fold greater than in HIV- uninfected children Cohen, 2015; 
Madhi , 2006 . Although RSV hospi[INVESTIGATOR_489585] 6 months 
of age, a considerable number of RSV infe ctions in children of 6 -15 months of age, still 
lead to bronchiolitis or (broncho)pneumonia requiring medical attention [ Fisher , 1997].
Previous infection with RSV does not prevent subsequent infections. Therefore, re -
infection with RSV occurs throughout an individual’s lifetime and is common in all age 
groups [ Simoes, 1999; Krilov, 2011]. These re -infections generally  go undiagnosed 
because they  usually present as common acute upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_6014]. I n more 
vulnerable persons (e.g. immunocompromized subjects or elderl y), re-infections can 
however also lead to severe disease [Graham , 2011] .
1.1.2. Current management of RSV disease in infants
To date, no vaccine is available against RSV and treatment of RSV disease is largely  
symptomatic and supportive care [ Murray , 2014].
The antiviral drug ribavirin is currently  the only  approved antiviral therapy for RSV 
treatment, but its use is restricted to severe hospi[INVESTIGATOR_489586] , difficulty  in administration (aerosol) and high cost  American 
Academ y of Pediatrics Subcom mittee on Diagnosis and Management of Bronchiolitis , 
2006 .

10-DEC-2017 39RSV -specific monoclonal antibodies (palivizumab, Synagis ) are indicated for use in 
infants at highest risk for severe RSV disease. Synagis is only  effective as prophy laxis 
and is not indicated or recommended in the general, health y infant population .
1.1.3. History  of enhanced RSV disease with formalin -inactivated RSV 
vaccines
In the late sixties, a formalin-inactivated whole virus RSV vaccine (FI- RSV) tested in 
clinical trials led to more severe clinical s ymptoms upon subsequent natural infection 
with RSV in children under the age of two years. Thirty -seven out of 140 (26%) of 
children receiving the FI -RSV were hospi[INVESTIGATOR_717489] [Polack, 2007] . The risk was greater in those children 
that were RSV -seronegative prior to immunization and did not occur in those that were 
RSV -seropositive.
This so- called ‘vaccine -induced enhanced RSV disease’ (ERD) is believed to have been 
due to the formalin inactivation step during vaccine production, leading to the induction 
of low -quality , non- neutralizing antibodies in RSV naïve infants Delgado , 2004 . These 
antibodies did not neutralize RSV infectivity  and contributed to the formation of immune 
complexes that may  have contributed to the severe clinical sy mptoms and potentially  
immunopathology of FI -RSV ERD [ Polack, 2002]. I n addition, it is hy pothesized that 
ERD may  have been linked to the induction of a Th2 -skewed cluster of differentiation 4
(CD4) T- cell immune response in previous naïve subjects [ Castilow , 2008].
Since that time, several investigational vaccines have been explored but, despi[INVESTIGATOR_717490] a 
century  of intense RSV vaccine development, there is not a single licensed vaccine for 
the prevention of severe RSV disease [ Anderson ,2013; Rudraraju, 2013; Murray , 2014].
1.1.4. Rationale for a viral vector -based RSV vaccine
Immunity  induced by  [CONTACT_717549] -infection, 
allowing re -infections to occur commonl y throughout life. Both arms of the immune 
system are involved in protection from severe d isease.
The humoral immune response is capable of neutraliz ing the virus and inhibiting viral 
replication, thereb y playing a major role in protection against lower RSV infection and 
severe disease [ Pi[INVESTIGATOR_29422] , 2003]. I ndeed, passive immuni zation with RSV- specific 
monoclonal antibodies ( Synagis), when given prophy lactically , has been shown to reduce 
RSV disease in premature infants and newborns with bronchopulmonary  dysplasia or 
underly ing cardiopulmonary  disease [ Cardenas, 2005].
T-cells are also involved in the control of RSV disease. Lethal RSV infections have been 
described in patients with low CD8 T -cellcounts as in the case of severe combined 
immunodefic iency , bone marrow and lung transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] [ Hertz , 1989]. The 
histopathology  of fatal cases of RSV infection of newborns shows that there is a relativ e 
paucity  of CD8 T -cells in the lung infiltrate [ Welliver , 2007]. Moreover, the presence of 
CD8 T -cells producing interferon gamma ( IFN-)has been ass ociated with diminished 
both Th2 responses and eosinophilia in animal models of RSV [ Castilow , 2008; Stevens , 
2009].

Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_978335] been shown to be potent 
inducers of CD8 T -cells producing IFN-and antibodies against expressed antigens 
[Liniger , 2007; Barnes , 2012].
Potent immunogenicity  and lack of p rolonged transgene expression have made 
replication incompetent adenoviruses attractive viral vectors for vaccine development. 
They  possess a stable virion, allowing inserts of foreign genes not to be deleted and they  
can infect man y different cell types; the transferred information remains epi[INVESTIGATOR_489592].
Chimpanzee -derived adenoviruses exhibit sequence homology  to human adenoviruses 
within the hexon protein in particular, which is a major capsid protein us ed for subgroup 
classification of adenoviruses [ Roy, 2011; Colloca , 2012]. They  are not known to cause 
pathological illness in humans and antibodies against chimpanzee adenoviruses have l ow 
or no seroprevalence ranging from 0 -4% in Europe and in the U nited States, up to 20% in 
the developi[INVESTIGATOR_14696], which is far less than the most common human adenovirus 
seroty pe 5 (Ad5) , with seroprevalence rates of 40 –45% in the U nited States and up to 
90% in sub- Saharan Africa [ Capone , 2013].
In conclusion, the chimpanzee- derived adenovectors have the following important 
features:
Weak neutrali zation by  [CONTACT_489731] .
Potent immunogenicity , mainly  Th1-directed.
Track record of good tolerability  in human clinical trials.
1.1.5. Antigens selected for the vaccine
The investigational vaccine is a recombinant viral vector manufactured using a s ynthetic

1.1.6. Pre-clinical and clinical experience
The candidate vaccine is based on the RSV viral proteins F, N and M2 -1 encoded b y a 
chimpanzee -derived adenovector (ChAd155 -RSV). A number of pre -clinical studies were 
conducted and have demonstrated immunogenicity, efficacy  and safet y of intramuscular 
(IM) injection of the ChAd155- RSV vaccine. Several animal models have been selected 
for such studies: mice, cotton rats and newborn calves. I mportantly , vaccination has not 
induced hallmarks of enhanced pathology  in these models. 
The immunogenicit y, safety  and reactogenicit y of the pediatric candidate RSV vaccine 
(ChAd155- RSV vaccine) have been evaluated in healthy  adults aged 18 to 45 y ears 
(study  201974 [RSV PED -001; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]]) There were no significant safet y 
concerns identified up to Day  60 in study  RSV PED -001. Overall, the ChAd155 -RSV 
vaccine high dose (Hd) (5 x 1010vp) seems to be more reactogenic (local and general) 
than the ChAd155- RSV vaccine low dose (Ld) (5 x 109vp), however, the reactogenicity  
profile was less than that observed in the Bexsero group. No safety  signal from the 
assessed hematology  parameters (hemoglobin, platelet count, prothrombin time and 
APTT) was observed in subjects receiving the ChAd155-RSV vaccine. No significant 
reductions in platelet count or clinically significant changes in coagulation parameters 
were observed up to [ADDRESS_978337] D ose 2. An approximately  2.4-fold increase in RSV -A 
neutralizing antibod y titers ( geometric mean titer [ GMT]from baseline) was observed in 
both RSV -Ld and RSV -Hd after Dose 1. No booster effect was evident after Dose 2. An 
anti-F IgA and IgG antibody  secreting B -cells response and an RSV F, N and M2 -[ADDRESS_978338] dose were 
observed with ELISpot. There was no booster response after the second vaccination. 
There was no specific vaccine -induced CD4 T -cellular response observed with 
intracellular staining (ICS). For CD8 T -cells only  a weak CD8 IFN-γ response to N was 
shown with ICS for some subjects.

1.2.2. Rationale for the choice of study  population
[IP_ADDRESS]. Study  population
The immunogenicit y, safety  and reactogenicit y of the pediatric candidate RSV vaccine 
(ChAd155- RSV vaccine) has been evaluated in healthy  adults aged 18 to 45 y ears (study  
201974 [RSV PED -001; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]]). The ChAd155- RSV vaccine is being 
developed for the active immunization of infants as from 6 w eeks of age. To allow age 
de-escalation from the adult population to the targeted population and to not enroll and 
administer the ChAd155 -RSV vaccine to older children who are bey ond the age of severe 
RSV disease and would not benefit from this vaccine, th e present study  will be performed
on RSV -seropositive infants aged 12to 23 m onths, after the safet y profile of the 
ChAd155- RSV vaccine in adults (study  201974 [RSV PED -001; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]]) was 
evaluated as satisfactory  by [CONTACT_717550] (IDMC). The 
present stud y will provide critical information on the safet y and immunogenicity  profile 
of the ChAd155- RSV vaccine before a subsequent trial in seronegative infants.
[IP_ADDRESS]. RSV serostatus using IBL International kit and c hoice of study  
population
To decrease the risk of ERD (refer to Section 1.1.3 ) in the present stud y, RSV -
seropositive infants aged 12 to 23 m onths will be enrolled .
RSV -seropositive infants will be screened using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay  
(ELISA) method (IBL International kit), detecting immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody  
against RSV F or G protein. The objective of th e screening for RSV -seropositive infants
is to limit the evaluation of the ChAd155 -RSV vaccine to infants previously  primed by  
[CONTACT_717551]. However this assay  does not 
discriminate between maternal antibodies and those naturall y acquired b y exposure to 
RSV. F or this reason, although the ChAd155 -RSV vaccine is not a FI -RSV vaccine, risk 
of ERD might still exist while vaccinating seropositive infants that have never been 
naturally exposed to RSV (RSV -naïve seropositive infants). However, [COMPANY_004] considers the 
risk of enrolling RSV -seronegative (i.e. false RSV -seropositive) infants in the present 
study  as extremel y low, for the two following reasons:
Beyond [ADDRESS_978340] that the RSV seropositivity  of infants 
aged 12to 23 months is rather due to natural exposure to RSV than to maternal 
antibodies. I n a randomized clinical trial performed in Bangladesh in which infants’ 
serum samples were collected at birth, 6, 10, 16, 20, 24, and [ADDRESS_978341] neutralizing antibody

in Keny a, the maternal -RSV antibodies in serum measured by [CONTACT_717552][INVESTIGATOR_717491] (half -life: 79 day s; [Ochola , 2009]). Another birth- cohort 
study  performed in Kenya, showed also a rapid decay  in RSV -neutralizing 
antibodies, with an half -life of 36 day s [Nyiro, 2015].
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_717492], a potential lack of 
sensitivity  of the IBL International kit compared to a RSV neutralization assay  has 
been reported [Malkin , 2013] . [COMPANY_004] considers that the specificit y and sensitivity  
characteristics of the assay indicate a reduced risk of enrolling RSV -seronegative 
infants identified RSV -seropositive in the assay  (i.e. false positive results).
Given these facts and data it is unlikely  that infants aged 12 months or above reported 
RSV -seropositive by  [CONTACT_717553] -seronegative and it was 
decided to perform this study  in infants aged 12 to 23 months.
1.2.3. Rationale for regimen, dose and route of administration
A vaccination regimen based on two IM injections (in the deltoid [if the muscle size is 
adequate; otherwise injections might be done in the anterolateral thigh]) of 5x 109, 
1.5 x 1010, or 5 x 1010viral particles (vp) of the ChAd155- RSV vaccine administered 
according to a 0, 1 -month schedule (4 -week interval between vaccinations) will be 
evaluated in this study .
The 4 -week interval regimen has been tested in pre -clinical models and results from a 
bovine RSV challenge model in which seronegative, colostrum -restricted newborn calves 
were vaccinated with two doses of 5 x 1010vp ChAd155 -RSV, four weeks apart showed 
that dose regimen was immunogenic and protected calves from bovine RSV disease and 
infection and was not associated to pulmonary  pathology .
Using a different adenovector, PanAd3, the 5 x 1010vp dose regimen was shown to be 
safe in toxicology  studies in mice. Pre- clinical data in different species (mice, cotton rats, 
non-human primates, and sero negative newborn calves) have shown that this regimen 
induces both anti -RSV F neutralizing antibodies and sy stemic T- cell responses [Taylor, 
2015; Pi[INVESTIGATOR_489694] , 2015].
A Phase I clinical trial evaluated a simian adenoviral vector -based RSV vaccine with the 
same insert (PanAd3 -RSV) [ RSV001 I nterim Study  Report , 2014]. Data from this trial, 
with 42 subjects, showed that a vaccination regimen based on two IM injections, 
separated b y four weeks, was safe and immunogenic.
Similar to the Phase I  adult study  (201974 [RSV PED -001]), the current study  is designed 
in a staggered manner to allow dose escalation from 5 x 109vp (1 -log lower dose) to [ADDRESS_978342] time in 
pediatric population study to allow a more progressive escalation of the dose -related risk 
in this vulnerable population.

(Amended 10 Dec ember 2017) .
Vaccination will be limited to a maximum of 10infants per day. In the same 
investigational center, infants will be vaccinated sequentially , separated by  a minimum 
interval of 60 minutes to allow monitoring of an y acute events (e.g. h ypersensitivity

An internal Safet y Review Committee (iSRC) will review all accumulating safet y data 
three weeks after the start of vaccination and then about every  three weeks until the 
IDMC has reviewed all safety data up to 30 day s after administration of Dose 2 in Step 3 
(i.e. Day  60). Ad-hoc iSRC meetings may  be held should safet y concerns warrant a safet y 
review. Refer to Section 9.10.2 for more information about iSRC.
The IDMC will review accumulating reactogenicity  and safet y data monthly  throug hout 
the period of vaccination (up to 30 day s after administration of Dose 2 in Step 3, i.e. Day  
60). The IDMC will also review incidence of all serious adverse events (SAEs) and 
incidence of RSV -respi[INVESTIGATOR_36115] (RTI), RSV -LRTI, RSV -severe L RTI and 
RSV -RTI leading to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_717493] m 
beginning of the first RSV season to the end of the study .
Both iSRC and I DMC will receive critical safet y data (i.e. SAEs and adverse events of 
specific interest) within 48 hours upon [COMPANY_004] becoming aware of it.
The iSRC and I DMC will determine whether an y of the predefined stud y holding rules 
are met. If this is the case, vaccination in the stud y will be immediately  put on hold. At 
any time, the IDMC may recommend to the sponsor to suspend the enrolment to the 
study  and/or vaccination based on the safet y data regularl y arising in this study.
Dose escalation will proceed after administration of two doses of the vaccine to [ADDRESS_978347] 16 subjects, the IDMC may allow for 
dose escalation to proceed without the requirement of enrolling and evaluating the full 
group size of 32 subjects .A subsequent dose escalation will proceed after 
administration of two doses of the vaccine to between a maximum of 32 to a minimum 
of 16 subjects in in the absence of a significant safety concern detected by [CONTACT_717554] .Thus, upon review of the 
accumulating safety data on a minimum of 16 subjects after administration of two 
doses of the vaccine, the IDMC may decide that based on the evolving safety profile, 
sufficient information has been accumulated to allow safe progression to the next 
sequential dose level (Amended 10 Dec ember 2017 ).It will be ensured that, a s a 
minimu m the IDMC will have review ed safet y data of at least 16 subjects for two doses 
and given their formal approval prior to enrolling subjects to the next dose level.
Additionally , the IDMC will perform a review when all safet y data u p to 30 day s after

10-DEC-2017 [IP_ADDRESS]. Rational e for monitoring of hematology parameters
Emphasis on “minimal risk” is imperative for the protection of the pediatric population 
participating to research studies where blood sample volume limits is a critical parameter. 
To stay  within blood sampling limits that are consistent with phy siological “minimal 
risk” in this y oung and vulnerable population, but also to minimize any development of 
needle aversion, blood draws for the determination of hematological parameters are 
scheduled at Day  1 and Day  31 (corresponding to the first day  after administration of the 
vaccine). Additional specimens will be draw n if any  ≥ Grade [ADDRESS_978348] been restricted to 9.0 mL  within 24 hours and 26.2 mL over eight weeks ( refer to 
Table 5 and Table 7).For investigational sites without a laboratory  in proximity  capable
to perform whole blood stimulation [WBS] necessary  for the CMI assay  the volumes will 
be less. Of note, it is considered that blood sample volumes ranging from 1 to 5% of total 
blood volume within 24 hours and up to 10% of total blood volume over 8 weeks are 
consistent with the limited evidence available on the minimal phy siological risk for 
healthy  children [ Howie ; 2011]. The total blood volume of a child is around 75 to 80 
mL/kg (85 to 105 mL /kg in the neonatal period). Considering a girl of 12 months of age 
with a low weight of 7.3kg (5thpercentile [ WHO ; 2006]), the minimal individual total 
blood volume in the study population would be 547.5 mL and therefore the safer limits of 
blood draw volumes would range from 5.5to 27.4 mL within 24 hours and be limited to 
54.7 mL over 8 w eeks. To minimize any  development of needle aversion, pain relief by 
[CONTACT_3553] a topi[INVESTIGATOR_717494] b y the protocol at the discretion of the investigator.
During a study  carried out in adult subjects ( RSV001 ), a mild non- clinically significant 
drop in hemoglobin was noted following vaccination with another adenoviral vector 
(PanAd3 -RSV) without clinical signs and with a reversal towards baseline values over 
time [ RSV001 I nterim Study  Report , 2014]. I n the repeat dose toxicology  study  in rabbits 
using the ChAd155 -RSV vaccine, a transient non -clinically  significant drop in platelets 
was noted post IM vaccina tion (maximal drop of platelet observed 24 hours after 
vaccination; refer to the current IB for further details). In light of these data, a clinical 
examination with special attention given to the detection of spontaneous bleeding or eas y 
bruising and evid ence of bruising or petechiae will be performed b y the 
investigator/stud y staff on Day 1, Day 3, Day 7, Day 31, Day 33 and Day 37. The visits 
on Day  3 and Day  33 may  be replaced by  a phone call by  [CONTACT_093]/study  staff to 
inquire of the infants' gen eral health and to solicit reports of a rash, spontaneous bleeding

Note that a broad safet y hematology  and biochemistry  evaluation was performed at each 
study  visit in adults during study  RSV PED -001 (201974; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) . In this study , 
blood samples for h ematology /biochemistry  were taken from all subjects at all study  
visits, i.e. at Screening, on the day  of vaccination (Day  0 and Day  30), [ADDRESS_978349] 
vaccination (Day  1 and Day  31), [ADDRESS_978350] vaccination (Day 3 and 33), [ADDRESS_978351] 
vaccination (Day  7 and 37), [ADDRESS_978352] Dose 2 (Day  60), on Day  180 and on Day  360. 
The safet y profile of the ChAd155- RSV vaccine was found to be satisfactory  by [CONTACT_489737]. No safet y signal from the assessed hematology parameters (hemoglobin, platelet 
count, prothrombin time and APTT) was observed in subjects receiving the ChAd155-
RSV vaccine. No significant reductions in platelet count or clinicall y significant changes 
in coagulation parameters were observed up to [ADDRESS_978353] D ose 2(refer to Section 1.1.6
and current IB ).
[IP_ADDRESS]. Rationale for RSV disease surveillance
Although the risk of ERD is thought to be very  low with an adenovirus -based vaccine 
(refer to Section 1.3.1) , all children will be closely monitored by  [CONTACT_717556] a clinical visit within 24 hours based on any  suspi[INVESTIGATOR_717495], wheezing or parental concern associated with sy mptoms of an RTI  (refer to 
Section 9.2). This will ensure prompt assessment of need for medical care. Furthermore, 
a limited number of subjects will be enrolled in this study . All of them will be under 
surveillance allow ingdescription of RSV associated L RTI and severe LRTI incidence in 
the ChAd155-RSV vaccine groups and the Placebo groups. All subjects experiencing 
LRTI associated with RSV will be considered as adverse events (AEs) of specific interest 
(refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS]) and will have to be reported within 24 h ours. I n order to support 
this timely  reporting, the investigator will make the diagnosis according to his/her 
medical judgment and locally -available diagnostic tests of RSV infections. Final anal ysis 
of RSV -LRTI will be performed according to standardized case definitions for clinical 
symptomatology  and diagnostic test at sponsor laboratory  (refer to Table 4 ) ensuring 
consistency  across sites.
1.2.5. Rationale for study  blinding
Given the different storage conditions of the investigational RSV vaccine and placebo, 
double blinding is not possible and the study  will be conducted in an observer -blind 
manner Amended 10 Dec ember 2017) .
When all data up to Day  60 are available, a statistical anal ysis will be performed. This 
analysis may  lead to the unblinding of some subjects. As a consequence, after Day  60, the 
study  cannot be considered as observer -blind, but will be conducted in a single -blind 
manner, with subjects’ parent(s)/ LAR(s) remaini ng blinded up to stud y end (Day 730).
The investigators will not have access to the treatment allocation up to study  end (Day  
730).

1.3. Benefit : Risk A ssessment
Approximately half of the infants ( between 32 and 48) in this study  will be exposed to

10 Dec ember 2017) .
Please refer to the current I Bfor the summary  of potential risks and benefits of
ChAd155- RSV vaccine .
The following section outlines the risk assessment and mitigation strategy  for this study  
protocol:
1.3.1. Risk A ssessment
As with all injectable vaccines, immediate s ystemic allergic reacti ons to vaccination can 
occur. In order to be able to treat infants with an immediate sy stemic allergic reaction to 
vaccination, all infants across all steps will need to remain under observation (visual 
follow -up as well as measurement of vital signs) at t he study  site for at least 60 minutes 
after vaccination.
Syncope (fainting) can occur following or even before any  vaccination as a psy chogenic 
response to the needle injection. Therefore, it is important that procedures are in place to 
avoid injury  from f ainting.
Risks linked to the investigational RSV vaccine
This study  is conducted in RSV -seropositive infants who are assumed to have been 
previously  infected with RSV and therefore not at risk for ERD. The detection of 
antibody  does not discriminate between maternally  acquired antibodies and those 
naturally  acquired by  [CONTACT_717557]. However, the risk of misclassification is believed 
to be low in infants from 6 months of age since in published data the estimated half -life
of maternall y acquired RSV antibody ranged from 31 to 79 day s [Chu, 2014; Ochola , 
2009; Nyiro, 2015].
IM vaccination commonly  precipi[INVESTIGATOR_14263] a transient and self -limiting local inflammatory  
reaction. This may  typi[INVESTIGATOR_717496], swelling and t enderness.
Most sy stemic sy mptoms observed in a clinical trial with a similar product carried out in 
healthy  adults (chimpanzee adenovirus -based vaccine with ChAd3 as vector for 
vaccination against hepatitis C) at doses to be used in this trial did not exc eed mild 
severit y [HCV001 Clinical Study  Report , 2011]. Fatigue, headache and malaise were the 
most commonly  reported sy stemic AEs overall.

Furthermore, in Ebola Phase I studies in adults investigating a similar ade noviral 
vectored vaccine (ChAd3 -EBO -Z), transient decreases in thrombocy te counts were also 
observed. These decreases occurred mostly  on Day  [ADDRESS_978354] of these decreases remained within t he 
normal range, the per protocol criteria for thrombocy topenia (i.e. thrombocy te count of < 
150 x 103/μL) were met for 2.6% (7 out of 270) of the vaccinated subjects. None of the 
decreases in thrombocy te counts or the cases of thrombocy topenia were clinic ally 
significant (i.e. no clinical signs or s ymptoms suggestive of increased tendency to 
bleed ingwere reported in any  of the subjects; refer to the current IB of recombinant 
chimpanzee adenovirus Ty pe 3-vectored Ebola Zaire vaccine for further details). 
Although the mechanism underly ing these decreases currently  remains unclear, it is well 
described in literature that, post intravenous administration, adenovirus activates platelets 
and induces platelet -leukocy te aggregate formation, causing an associated i ncrease in 
platelet and leukocy te-derived microparticles [ Othman, 2007; Stone , 2007].
No significant safet y concerns were identified up to [ADDRESS_978355] Dose 2 in study  RSV 
PED -001 with the ChAd155- RSV vaccine in healthy  adults aged 18 to 45 y ears (refer to 
Section 1.1.6 and to the current IB ). 
All available safet y information from clinical and pre -clinical studies was evaluat ed by 
[CONTACT_23983]’s Safet y Review Team . It was concluded that the available informa tion did not pose 
an immediate safet y concern, since the decreases seen were transient and not clinically  
significant. Nevertheless, since this is the first time the ChAd155 -RSV vaccine is 
administered to infants and to ensure a maximum safet y follow-up, a safety monitoring 
plan has been put in place (refer to Section 1.2.4).
1.3.2. Benefit A ssessment
The infants receiving the investigational ChAd155 -RSV vaccine may not directl y benefit 
from vaccination since the efficacy  of the investigational ChAd155- RSV vaccine has not 
been assessed yet and it is hence not known whether it is effective in protecting against 
RSV infection.
Subjects’ parent(s)/ LAR(s) cou ld gain medical advices about their infant’s general health 
status through the medical evaluations/assessments associated with this study  (i.e. 
physical examination, blood testing [ hematology and biochemistry  data], surveillance for 
RTI and LRTI).

a Surveillance for RSV -RTI comprises monthly nasal swab collected to detect asymptomatic RSV infections during RSV season and active and passive sur veillance contacts for RSV 
symptomatic RTI (see Section 9.2). Data about RSV –RTI incidence will be reviewed monthly by [CONTACT_41774].
b Within each step, an iSRC will review all accumulating safety data three weeks after the start of vaccination and then about every three weeks ( until the IDMC has reviewed all safety 
data up to 30 days after administration of Dose 2 in Step 3 i.e. Day 60) . The IDMC will review all accumulating reactogenicity a nd safety data monthly throughout the period of 
vaccination (up to 30 days after administration of Dose 2 in Step 3, i.e. Day 60) and accumulating SAEs until Day 730. Refer to Sections 9.10.2 and 9.10.3.

d Dose escalation will proceed after administration of two doses of the vaccine to [ADDRESS_978357] 16 subjects, the IDMC may allow for dose escalation to proceed without the requirement of enrolling and 
evaluating the full group size of 32 subjects. A subsequent d ose escalation (from Step 2 to Step 3) will proceed after administration of two doses of the vaccine to 
between a maximum of 32to a minimum of 16 subjects in the absence of a significant safety concern detected by [CONTACT_717559] .Thus, upon review of the accumulating safety data on a minimum of 16 subjects after administration of two doses of the vaccine, the IDMC may decide that 
based on the evolving safety profile, sufficient information has been accumulated to allow safe progression to the next sequential dose le vel. (Amended 10 Dec ember
2017) Itwill be ensured that, as a minimum the IDMC will have reviewed safety data of at least 16 subje cts for two doses and given their formal approval prior to enrolling subjects to 
the next dose level.

may be repeated once only .All screening procedures will be repeated except the blood 
sampling for CMI response and humoral response (neutralizing antibod y titers against 
RSV -A, RSV F protein antibody  concentrations and palivizumab- competing antibod y 
concentrations) .Blood sampling to assess RSV serostatus (IBL International kit) might 
not be repeated if the infant has been confirmed RSV- seropositive during the first 
screening.

The target will be to enroll up to [ADDRESS_978364] vaccination (unless the dose escalation IDMC decision can be made based 
on the evaluation of accumulating safety data on fewer subjects to ensure that at least 
64infants receive twodosesof study  vaccine (ChAd155- RSV  or Placebo) (see Section 
5.1)(Amended 10 Dec ember 2017) .Infants will be randoml y assigned to twostudy  
groups per step in a (1: 1) ratio ( approximately  16subjects in each group) .
In Step 1 , between approximately  8 and 16RSV -seropositive infants will be 
randomly  assigned to receive low dose ChAd155- RSV vaccine (5 x 109vp [RSV -
Ld]; 0.5 mL ) and between approximately  8 and 16RSV -seropositive infants will be 
randomly  assigned to receive placebo (0.5 mL). (Am ended 10 Dec ember 2017)
In Step 2 , between approximately  8 and 16RSV -seropositive infants will be 
randomly  assigned to receive middle dose ChAd155 -RSV vaccine (1.5 x 1010vp 
[RSV -Md]; 0.15 mL ) and between approximately 8 and 16 RSV -seropositive infants
will be randomly  assigned to receive placebo (0.15 mL ).(Am ended 10 Dec ember
2017)
In Step 3, approximately 16RSV -seropositive infants will be randomly  assigned to 
receive high dose ChAd155 -RSV vaccine (5 x 1010vp [RSV -Hd]; 0.5 mL ) and 
approximately  16RSV -seropositive infants will be ran doml y assigned to receive 
placebo (0.5 mL).
Allocation of the subject to a study  group at the investigator site will be performed using 
a randomi zation sy stem on internet (SBIR). Within each step, the randomization 
algorithm will use a minimization procedure accounting for center.
After obtaining the signed and dated ICF f rom the subject’s parent(s)/LAR(s) and having 
checked the eligibility  of the subject, the study  staff in charge of the vaccine
administration will access SBI R. Upon providing the subject identification number, the 
randomi zation sy stem will determine the study  group and will provide the treatment 
number to be used for the first dose .
The number of each administered treatment must be recorded in the eCRF on the Vaccine 
Administration s creen.
When SBI R is not available, please refer to the SBIR user guide or the SPM for specific 
instructions.
[IP_ADDRESS].2. Treatment number allocation for subsequent doses
For each dose subsequent to the first dose, the study  staff in charge of the vaccine
administration will access SBI R, provide the subject identification number, and the 
system will provide a treatment number consistent with the allocated study group.
The number of each administered tre atment must be recorded in the eCRF on the Vaccine 
Administration sc reen.

10-DEC-2017 646.3. Method of blinding
Data will be collected in an observer -blind manner. By  [CONTACT_43049]-blind, it is meant that 
during the course of the study , the vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_42973] y stud y endpoint (e.g. safety, reactogenici ty)will all be unaware of which 
vaccine was administered. To do so, vaccine preparation and administration will be done 
by [CONTACT_717562] y of the study clinical 
evaluation assay s.
When all data up to Day  60 are available, a statistical anal ysis will be performed. This
analysis may  lead to the unblinding of some subjects. As a consequence, after Day  60, the 
study  cannot be considered as observer -blind, but will be conducted in a single -blind 
manner, with subjects’ parent(s)/ LAR(s) remaining blinded up to study  end (Day 730).
The investigators will not have access to the treatment allocation up to study  end ( Day 
730).
The laboratory  in charge of the laboratory  testing will be blinded to the treatment, and 
codes will be used to link the subject and study  (without any  link to the treatment 
attributed to the subject) to each sample.
6.4. General study  aspects
Supplementary  study  conduct information not mandated to be present in this protocol is 
provided in the accompany ing SPM. The SPM provides the investigator and the site 
personnel with administrative and detailed technical information that does not impact the 
safet y of the subjects.
Vaccination will be limited to a maximum of [ADDRESS_978365] eight infants (corresponding to three to five ChAd155 -RSV 
vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]) in each Step (1, 2, and 3) before continuing vaccination of more 
infants (i.e. from the ninth infant). From the ninth infant, infants will be vaccina ted 
sequentially , separated by  a minimum interval of 60 minutes.
Refer to Section 9.10 for information about limited vaccination, holding rules, saf ety 
monitoring and safet y evaluation by [CONTACT_489743].

Minimi zing environmental contamination with genetically modified organisms
Each product will be used in accordance with the applicable geneticall y modified 
organism regulations.
To minimize release of the recombinant vectored vaccine virus into the environment, 
each vaccine is produced under good manufacturing practice conditions with the handling 
of live material in appropriate laboratory facilities. This is to ensure that any  release of 
modified organism is contained, inactivated and incinerated, using single use equipment 
as much as possible, to avoid release of modified genetic material into the environment.
After each vaccination, the injection site will be covered with a dressing in order to 
absorb an y virus that may leak out through the needle track. The dressing will be 
removed onl y after 30 minutes and will be disposed as genetically modified organism 
waste b y autoclaving or in accordance with the applicable guidelines/ SOPs at the 
investigator’s site.
7.4. Replacement of unusable vaccine doses
In addition to the vaccine doses provided for the planned number of subjects (including 
over-randomi zation when applicable), at least 10% additional vaccine doses will be 
supplied to r eplace those that are unusable.
The investigator will use SBI R to obtain the replacement vial number. The replacement 
numbers will be allocated by  [CONTACT_2715]. The s ystem will ensure, in a blinded manner, that the 
replacement vial matches the formulation the subje ct was assigned to by  [CONTACT_669436].

9.1. Safet y definitions
9.1.1. Definition of an adverse event
An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject, temporall y 
associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the 
medicinal product.
An AE can therefore be any  unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporall y associated with 
the use of a medicinal product. For marketed medicinal products, this also includes 
failure to produce expected benefits (i.e. lack of efficacy ), abuse or misuse. 
Examples of an AE include:
Significant or unexpected worsening or exacerbation o f the condition/indication 
under study .

10-DEC-2017 92Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency  and/or intensity  of the condition.
New conditions detected or diagnosed after investigational vaccine(s) admi nistration 
even though they  may  have been present prior to the start of the study .
Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction.
Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either 
investigational vaccine(s) or a concurrent medication (overdose per se should not be 
reported as an AE/SAE).
Signs, sy mptoms temporally  associated with vaccine(s) administration.
Significant failure of expected pharmacological or biological action. 
AEs to be recorded as endpoints (solicited AEs) are described in Section 9.1.3 . All other 
AEs will be recorded as UNSOLI CITED AEs.
Examples of an AE DO NOT include:
Medical or surgical procedures (e.g. endoscop y, appendectom y); the condition that 
leads to the procedure is an AE/SAE.
Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (e.g. social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], a dmission for routine examination).
Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present 
or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen. 
Pre-existing conditions or signs and/or s ymptoms present in a subject prior to the 
firststudy  vaccination. These events will be recorded in the medical history  section 
of the eCRF.
9.1.2. Definition of a serious adverse event
A SAE is any  untoward medical occurrence that:
a.Results in death,
b.Is life -threatening,
Note: The term ‘life-threatening’ in the definition of ‘serious’ refers to an event in 
which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an 
event, which h ypothetically  might have caused death, had it been more severe.
c.Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_717512],
Note: I n general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_717513]/or treatment that would not have 
been appropriate in the phy sician’s office or in an out -patient setting. Complications 
that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_717514]. If a complication prolongs

AE should be considered serious.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_336805] a pre -existing condition (known or 
diagnosed prior to informed consent signature) that did not worsen from baseline is 
NOT co nsidered an AE.
d.Results in disability /incapacity
Note: The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability  to 
conduct normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include experiences 
of relativel y minor medical significanc e such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea , influenza like illness, and accidental trauma (e.g. sprained ankle) 
which may  interfere or prevent every day life functions but do not constitute a 
substantial disruption.
Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether reporting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may  not be 
immediately  life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_717515]. These should also be considered serious. 
Examples of such events are invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an 
emergency  room or at home fo r allergic bronchospasm, blood dy scrasias or convulsions 
that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1838].

All subjects experiencing a L RTI associated with RSV infection should be reported as 
AE of specific interest in an expedited manner for the duration of their participation to 
the study . These will be detected through the surveillance for RSV- RTI (refer to Section 
9.2).
To identify  RSV -LRTI for the purpose of AE of specific interest, the diagnosis should be 
based on the investigators’ clinical judgment taking into account the clinical history , the 
examination, relevant medical investigations and locally -available diagnostic test for 
RSV. Of note the case definition presented in Table 4is based on a limited set of 
symptoms and signs and is designed for protocol specified anal yses pooled across sites at 
study  conclusion and should not be used for the purpose of reporting RSV -LRTI as an 
AE of specific interest during the trial conduct.
In addition to report these cases as AE of specific interest, the investigator should 
investigate the case according to the procedures for the surveillance of RSV -RTI (refer to 
Section 9.2) and document it in the eCRF. Of note a nasal swab should be taken for 
confirmatory  testing of RSV infection by  [CONTACT_456].

Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_978409] -study  AE/SAE is defined as any  event that occurs outside of the AE/SAE 
reporting period defined in Table 18. Investigators are not obligated to actively  seek AEs 
or SAEs in former stud y participants. However, if the investigator learns of any SAE at
any time after a subject has been discharged from the study , and he/she considers the 
event reasonabl y related to the investigational vaccine s, the investigator will promptly  
notify  the Study  Contact [CONTACT_43075].
9.3.3. Evaluation of adverse events and se rious adverse events
[IP_ADDRESS]. Active questioning to detect adverse events and serious adverse 
events
As a consistent method of collecting AEs, the subject’s parent(s)/LAR(s) should be asked 
a non -leading question such as:
‘Has your child acted differently or felt d ifferent in any way since receiving the vaccine s
or since the last visit?’
When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility  of the investigator to review all

10-DEC-2017 105The investigator will assess the maximum intensity that occurred over the duration of the 
event for all unsolicited AEs (including SAEs) recorded during the stud y. The assessment 
will be based on the investigator’s clinical judgment.
The intensity  should be assigned to one of the following categories:
1 (mild) =An AE which is easil y tolerated b y the subject, causing minimal 
discomfort and not interfering with every day activities.
2 (moderate) =An AE which is sufficiently  discomforting to interfere with 
normal every day activities.
3 (severe) =An AE which prevents normal, every day activities. S uch an AE 
would, for example, prevent attendance at kindergarten/a day- care 
center and would cause the parent(s )/LAR(s) to seek medical 
advice.
An AE that is asses sed as Grade 3 (severe) should not be confused with a SAE. Grade 
3 is a category  used for rating the intensit y of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be 
assessed as Grade 3. An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets one of the pre -
defined outcomes as described in Section 9.1.2.
[IP_ADDRESS].2. Assessment of causality
The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between investigational vaccine
and the occurrence of each AE/SAE. The investigator will use clinical judgment to 
determine the relationship. Alternative plausible causes, such as natural history  of the 
underly ing diseases, concomitant therapy , other risk factors, and the temporal 
relationship of the event to the investigational vaccine swill be considered and 
investigated. The investigator will also consult the IB to determine his/her assessment.
There may  be situations when a SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to [COMPANY_004] Biologicals. However, it is v ery 
important that the investigator alway s makes an assessment of causality  for every  event 
prior to submission of the Expedited Adverse Events Report to [COMPANY_004] Biologicals. The 
investigator may  change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_19954] -up inform ation and 
update the SAE information accordingl y. The causality assessment is one of the criteria 
used when determining regulatory  reporting requirements.
In case of concomitant administration of multiple vaccines/products, it may not be 
possible to determ ine the causal relationship of general AEs to the individual vaccine
administered. The investigator should, therefore, assess whether the AE could be causall y 
related to vaccination rather than to the individual vaccines.

Is there a reasonable possibility that the AE may have been caused by [CONTACT_717574]?
YES :There is a reasonable possibility  that the vaccine contributed to the 
AE.
NO :There is no reasonable possibility that the AE is causally  related to 
the administration of the study  vaccine . There are other, more 
likely  causes and administration of the study  vaccine is not 
suspected to have contributed to the AE.
If an event meets the criteria to be determined as ‘serious’ (see Section 9.1.2 ), additional 
examinations/tests will be performed b y the investigator in order to determine ALL 
possible contributing factors for each SAE.
Possible contributing factors include:
Medical hist ory.
Other medication.
Protocol required procedure.
Other procedure not required by  [CONTACT_760].
Lack of efficacy  of the vaccines, if applicable.
Erroneous administration.

who are not otherwise involved in the conduct of the project. The iSRC safety  reviews 
will be conducted using unblinded data. The iSRC has access to the subject 
randomization and reviews unblinded data.
The iSRC will review all accumulating safet y data three weeks after the start of 
vaccination and then about every  three weeks (until the I DMC has reviewed all safet y 
data up to 30 day s after administration of Dose 2 in Step 3 (i.e. Day  60). The iSRC 
members will determine if a safet y signal should be escalated to the IDMC. The iSRC 
members will determine whether an y of the predefined holding rules are met (refer to 
Section 9.10.5) or if there is any  other safet y signal. I n this case, vaccination in the study  
will be immediately  put on hold (refer to Section 9.10.6).

study  participants throughout the study  period. It will provide initial, regular, and closing 
advice to [COMPANY_004] Biologicals on medical, ethical, scientific and safety- related issues. I ts 
advice will be based on the interpretation of study data with reference to the study  
protocol.
The IDMC will review the protocol and statistical anal ysis plan. Meetings will be 
documented and minutes of open sessions of the I DMC meetings made available to the 
sponsor. The IDMC may, if deemed necessary , convene a meeting with, or request 
further information from the principal investigators and [COMPANY_004] Biologicals’ designated 
project representatives at any  stage of the study .
The ID MC may  recommend to the sponsor to suspend the enrolment to the study  and/or 
vaccination based on their review of safety  data arising in this study  (refer to Section 
9.10.6).
The IDMC safety  reviews will be conducted using unblinded data. The IDMC will 
review all available safety  data while taking into account any  other findings that could 
have an impact on the safety  of the subjects.
The IDMC members will determine whether any  of the predefined study  holding rules 
are met (refer to Section 9.10.5) or if there is an y other safet y signal. If this is the case, 
vaccination in the stud y will be immediately  put on hold. If no safet y signal is observed, 
the favorable outcome of the safet y evaluation authorizing the investigator to proceed 
with vaccination of infants as outlined in Figure 1, will be also documented and provided 
in writing.

Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_978430] w ithdrawal from the study
From an anal ysis perspective, a ‘withdrawal’ from the study  refers to any  subject who did 
not com e back for the concluding visit foreseen in the protocol.
All data collected until the date of withdrawal/last contact [CONTACT_43092].
A subject is considered a ‘withdrawal’ from the study  when no study  procedure has 
occurred, no follow -up has been perfo rmed and no further information has been collected 
for this subject from the date of withdrawal/last contact.
Investigators will make an attempt (e.g. three telephone calls and a certified letter to the 
last known address) to contact [CONTACT_489769] -up.
Information relative to the withdrawal will be documented in the eCRF. The investigator 
will document whether the decision to withdraw a subject from the stud y was made b y 
the subject’s parent(s) /LAR(s ), or b y the investigator, as well as which of the following 
possible reasons was responsible for withdrawal:
SAE .
Non-SAE .
Protocol violation (specify ).
Consent withdrawal, not due to an AE*.
Moved from the stud y area.
Lost to follow -up.
Other (specify ).
*In case a subject is withdrawn from the study  because the subject’s parent(s) /LAR(s)
has withdrawn consent, the investigator will document the reason for withdrawal of 
consent, if specified b y the subject’s parent(s)/LAR(s), in the eCRF .

distinguished from subjects who are withdrawn for other reasons. Investigators will 
follow subjects who are withdrawn from the study  as result of a SAE/AE until resolution 
of the event (see Section 9.5.2).
10.2.2. Subject w ithdrawal from investigational vaccine
A ‘withdrawal’ from the investigational vaccine refers to an y subject who does not 
receive the complete treatment, i.e. when no further planned dose is administered from 
the date of withdrawal. A subject withdrawn from the investigational vaccine may  not 
necessarily  be withdrawn from the study  as further study  procedures or follow -up may  be 
performed (safet y or immunogenicit y) if planned in the study  protocol. The investigator 
should make all efforts to ensure that the subjects remain in the study  to ensure a proper 
safet y follow- up and medical care if needed.
Information relative to premature discontinuation of the investigational vaccine will be 
documented on the Vaccine Administration s creen of the eCRF. The investigator will 
document whether the decision to discontinue further vaccinat ion was made by [CONTACT_1560]’s parent(s) /LAR(s) , or b y the investigator, as well as which of the following 
possible reasons was responsible for withdrawal:
SAE.

cohort/Step, randomized 1:1 to vaccine or plac ebo, was based on conventional study 
designs for Phase 1/[ADDRESS_978431], two- sided 95% confidence interval (CI) would rule 
out an AE rate of 20% or more; if the incidence rate of AE sis more than 10%, there 
will still be more than an 80% chance of observing at least one subject with this AE. 
Combining all RSV vaccinees across all dose levels, there will be more than a 99% 
chance of observing at least one subject with this AE.
Furthermore, with 16 RSV vaccine es, the maximum width of a 95% CIfor the 
proportion of subjects with adverse events among 16 vaccinees is about 50% (see

If we assume platelet counts in healthy infants between 12 and 23 months follow a 
normal distribution with a mean 
of 300,000 platelets/ mm³ and a standard deviation of 
75,000 platelets/ mm³, then we would expect 0.04% of unvaccinated infants to have a 
count below [ZIP_CODE] platelets/ mm³, which is the cut -off for a Grade 3 thrombocytopenia. 
To rule out a four -fold or greater increase, we would need to show that the mean 
platelet count does not fall below 190,000 platelets/ mm³ with a standard deviation of 
47,500. The sample size needed to rule out a 110,000 platelets/ mm³ decrease due to

If available, an y further exploratory immunology results (including, but not limited to 
anti-vector immunity ) will be reported b y group and timepoint using descriptive 
summary  statistics.
11.10. Analysis of RTI and LRTI
The anal ysis will be performed on the TVC on two pooled groups (i.e. pooled RSV and 
pooled Placebo) separately  for first and second RSV seasons and overall.
The proportion of subjects with at least one RSV- associated RTI (with 95 % CI ) will be 
calculated. The same descriptive anal ysis will be performed for subjects with at least one 
RSV -associated LRTI and those with at least one RSV -associated severe LRTI .
As primary  analy sis, the assessment of RSV infection will be performed using the 
quantitative RT-PCR according to standardized case definitions (see Table 4) based on 
the available WHO case definitions.

11.11. Interpretation of analy ses
Comparative anal yses will be exploratory  and should be interpreted with caution 
considering that there is no adjustment for multiplicity  and that group sizes are small for 
these comparisons.
11.12. Conduct of analy ses
Any deviation(s) or change(s) from the original statistical plan outlined in this protocol 
will be described and justified in the final study  report.
11.12.1. Sequence of analy ses
In preparation of the planned IDMC and iSRC evaluations, analy ses of all available 
safet y data (data that are as clean as possible) will be performed (see Sec tion 9.10 for 
more information). These anal yses will be done by  [CONTACT_717591], and will be docu mented in a statistical analy sis report. Onl y 
the outcome of the IDMC and iSRC reviews will be communicated to the RSV study  
team (no safety  signal or safet y signal). No clinical study  report will be written.
The statistical anal yses will be performed in 3steps:
Afirst anal ysis will be performed when all data up to Day 60 (i.e. data that are as 
clean as possible) are available. Additional safet y data available at the time of this 
analysis will be described. At this point, the statistician will be unblinde d (i.e. 
individual subject treatment assignments will be available) and the stud y will be 
conducted in a single -blind manner, with patients remaining blinded up to study  end 
(Day  730). Summary  results may  unblind some specific subjects but no individual 
listings will be provided and the investigators will not have access to the treatment 
allocation up to study  end (Day  730) , except in case of emergency  unblinding (see 
Section 9.8).
An anal ysis will be performed when all data up to Visit 10(Day  365; i.e. data that 
are as clean as possible) are available. No individual listings will be provided.
The final analy sis will be performed when all data up to study  conclusion (Day  730) 
are available. A n integrated clinical study  report containing all data will be written 
and made available to the investigators at that time.
If the data for tertiary  endpoi nts become available at a later stage, (an) additional 
analysis/ anal yses will be performed. These data will be documented in annex(es) to 
the study  report and will be made available to the investigators at that time.

Assay  descriptions could be subjects to change, due to assay  re-development and/or 
qualification.
Sero status to RSV F and/or G protein
The selection of seropositive infants at screening will be based on ELISA with F and G 
protein coating antigens us ing a commercial kit (IBL kit).
Intracellular staining (ICS)
ICShas been used to assess CMI responses as previously  described [Díez -Domingo , 
2010; Moris , 2011].
Within [ADDRESS_978452] phlebotomy , approximately  350 µL  of undiluted whole blood are 
incubated at 37°C with the relevant antigen (in this case pools of 15 -mer peptides 
overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_007] b y 11 amino acids and spanning the sequences of F, N, and M2 -1 proteins), 
negative control (medium), or positive control (staphylococcal enteroto xin B) for 2 hours 
in the presence of anti- CD28 and anti -CD49d antibodies. Brefeldin A, a protein secretion 
inhibitor, is then added and the mix is incubated overnight. Red cells are then ly sed and 
white cells washed, fixed, cry opreserved, and stored until analy sis by  [CONTACT_448317] .
Once read y for cytometry anal ysis, white cells are thawed in batches, washed, and 
incubated with fluorochrome -conjugated antibodies specific to CD4 and CD8 surface 
markers. Then, cells are permeabilized and stained with fluorochrome -conjugated 
antibodies specific for the following immune markers: IL-2, IFN -, TNF -, CD40L ,IL-
13, IL-17, and 41BB . After washing, acquisition of data is performed via a flow 
cytometer.
The results are expressed as the frequency  of CD4 +or CD8+ T- cells expressing, per 
million of CD4+ or CD8+ T- cells:
CD3+/CD4+ T- cells expressing at least two markers among CD40L, IL -2, TNF -α, 
and IFN -γ (pol y-functional CD4+ T- cells). 
CD3+/CD4+ and/or CD3+/CD8+ T -cells expressing at least one or any  combination 
of immune marker(s) among CD40L, 41BB, IL-2, TNF -α, IFN -γ, IL-13 and IL -17 
(for determination of Th profile). 
Neutralization assay
The serum neutralization assay  is a functional assay  that measures the ability  of serum 
antibodies to neutralize RSV entry  and replication in a host cell line.
First, virus neutralization is performed b y incubating a fixed amount of RSV -A long 
strain (ATCC No. VR -26) with serial dilutions of the test serum. Then, the serum-virus 
mixture is transferred onto a monolay er of Vero ce lls (African Green Monkey , kidney , 
Cercopi[INVESTIGATOR_227203], ATCC CCL -81) and incubated for three day s to allow infection of 
Vero cells by  [CONTACT_105]- neutralized viruses and the formation of plaques in the cell monolay er.

Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_978453] RSV (anti -RSV IgG) and a secondary  antibody  conjugated with 
fluorescein isothiocy anate, allowing the visualization of plaques by  [CONTACT_31122]. 
Viral plaques are counted using an automated m icroscope coupled to an image anal yzer 
(Scanlab s ystem with Axiovision software). For each serum dilution, a ratio, expressed as 
a percentage, is calculated between the number of plaques at that dilution and the number 
of plaques in the virus control wells (no serum added). The serum neutralizing antibod y 
titer is expressed in ED60 (Estimated Dilution 60) and corresponds to the inverse of the 
interpolated serum dilution that y ields a 60% reduction in the number of plaques 
compared to the virus control wells as described by [CONTACT_2312] [ Barbas, 1992; Bates , 2014].
ELISA
Anti- RSV protein F ELISA
The anti -F protein IgG ELISA is an indirect ELISA allowing the detection and the 
quantitation of specific IgG antibodies directed against the RSV F protein in human 
serum samples. (Amended 10 Dec ember 2017)
Palivizumab competitive assay
Palivizumab monoclonal antibody  (Synagis) is used as a passive treatment that 
protects against RSV infection by  [CONTACT_717594] I I epi[INVESTIGATOR_489673] 
F antigen.
First, F protein antigens purified from CHO expression sy stem a re coated onto [ADDRESS_978454] are 
added in sequence with competitor antibodies (horseradish peroxid ase-conjugated 
palivizumab) and incubated to allow specific binding of antibodies directed against 
the F protein antigens. If palivizumab-like antibodies are present in serum samples, 
they will compete with the horseradish peroxidase -conjugated palivizumab
antibodies for binding to the F protein coated antigen. After a washing step, the 
horseradish peroxidase substrate solution (TMB/H 2O2) is added and a colored 
product develops in a manner that is inversel y proportional to the amount of 
palivizumab -like ant ibodies contained in the test serum. The color is quantified by  
[CONTACT_489784] 450 -620 nm using a spectrophotometer. Antibody  
concentrations of individual serum and control samples are determined after 
interpolation from the ELISA standar d curve using a four -parameter equation and are 
expressed as palivizumab- equivalent antibodies in microgram per millilitre (µg/mL).
PCR
Quantitative PCR able to discriminate RSV -A and RSV -B subty pes:
Briefl y, RSV A and RSV B RNAs extracted from the nasal swabs are detected in a 
duplex PCR format using specific amplification primers and fluorescent probes 
designed in the RSV N gene, encoding the RSV nucleocapsid protein. The process 
involves nucleic acids extraction, conversion of RNA to complementary  
deox yribonucleic acid b y reverse transcription and detection b y real -time PCR 
reaction using a calibration curve (absolute quantitation). The RSV viral load is 
reported as copi[INVESTIGATOR_333946].

Rationale/background for changes:
!The Spanish competent authorities (Agencia Española de Medicamentos y Productos 
Sanitarios [AEMPS]) requested the Sponsor to extend the long term medical follow-
up for one additional year. The purpose of this amendment is to respond to this request by [CONTACT_717597]-up of the subjects from one year to two years. This will include the collection of adverse events (adverse events of specific interest [RSV-LRTI] and serious adverse events), the surveillance for respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092], difficulty of breathing and wheezing.
!The Italian competent authorities (Agenzia Italiana del Farmaco [AIFA]) requested 
that, in addition to the 60 minutes observation planned per protocol between each 
infants receiving ChAd155-RSV vaccination, the Sponsor monitors potential hypersensitivity reactions for a longer period following both vaccine administrations (one month apart) in a sufficient number of infants before another one can be vaccinated with the same dose. The Sponsor agreed to put in place a 48-hour observation period after the first and second doses administered to the first eight infants enrolled in each step, before continuing vaccination of more infants with a minimum interval of [ADDRESS_978464].
!Following the request from investigators, the screening period has been increased 
from 15 days (Day -14 to Day 0) to 30 da ys (Day -29 to Day 0) in order to improve 
recruitment of subjects.
!Following the request from investigators, the following exclusion criteria have been 
clarified:
∀History of wheezing.
∀History of chronic cough.
!The satisfactory outcome of the review by [CONTACT_269395] (IDMC) of safety data from study 201974 (RSV PED-001) in healthy

Rationale for the study 
and study design!Study population : The immunogenicity, safety and 
reactogenicity of the pediatric candidate RSV vaccine 
(ChAd155-RSV vaccine) are currently being evaluated in healthy adult subjects aged 18 to 45 years (study 201974 [RSV PED-001]). The ChAd155-RSV vaccine is being developed for the active immunization of infants as from 6 weeks of age. To allow age de-escalation from the adult population to the targeted population and to not enroll and administer the ChAd155-RSV vaccine to older children who are beyond the age of severe RSVdisease and would not benefit from this vaccine, the present study will be performed on RSV-seropositive infants aged 12 to 17 months, pending satisfactory
after the safety profile of the ChAd155-RSV vaccine 
in adults (study 201974 [RSV PED-001; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]]) was evaluated as satisfactory by [CONTACT_140954] (IDMC) .

ChAd155-RSV vaccine before a subsequent trial in 
seronegative infants .
Study blinding: Given the different appearance and 
storage conditions of the investigational RSV vaccine 
and placebo, double blinding is not possible and the 
study  will be conducted in an observer- blind manner.
When all data up to Day  60 are available, a statistical 
analysis will be performed. This analy sis may  lead to 
the unblinding of some subjects. As a consequence, 
after Day  60, the study  cannot be considered as 
observer -blind, but will be conducted in a single-
blind manner, with subjects’ parent(s)/ legall y 
acceptable representative ( LAR[s]) remaining blinded 
up to study  end ( Day 365Day 730 ). The investigators 
will not have access to the treatment allocation up to 
study  end ( Day 365Day 730 ).
Staggered design with 3 steps:
Vaccination will be limited to a maximum of 10 
infants per day . In the same investigational center, 
infants will be vaccinated sequentially , separated by  a 
minimum interval of 60 minutes to allow monitoring 
of an y acute events (e.g. hypersensitivity reaction). In 
addition, to monitor delayed potential reactions 
following vaccination, there will be a [ADDRESS_978465] eight infants 
(corresponding to three to five ChAd155 -RSV  
vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]) in each Step (1, 2, and 3) before 
continuing vaccination of more infants (i.e. from 
the ninth infant). From the ninth infant , infants will 
be vaccinated sequentially, separated by a minimum 
interval of 60 minutes. Refer to the study procedures 
manual (SPM) for more details about the [ADDRESS_978466] eight subjects 
vaccinated in each Step.
Within each step, an internal Safet y Review 
Committee (iSRC) will review accumulated safety  
data three weeks after the start of vaccination an d

10-DEC-2017 152In Section [IP_ADDRESS] Study population , the following changes have been made:
The immunogenici ty, safety  and reactogenicit y of the pediatric candidate RSV 
vaccine (ChAd155 -RSV vaccine) are currentl y being evaluated in healthy adults 
aged 18 to 45 years (study 201974 [RSV PED -001; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]]). The ChAd155-
RSV vaccine is being developed for the act ive immunization of infants as from 6 
weeks of age. To allow age de-escalation from the adult population to the targeted 
population and to not enroll and administer the ChAd155 -RSV vaccine to older 
children who are bey ond the age of severe RSV disease and would not benefit from 
this vaccine, the present study will be performed on RSV -seropositive infants aged 
12 to 17 months, pending satisfactory after the safety  profile of the ChAd155- RSV 
vaccine in adults (study  201974 [RSV PED -001; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]]) was eval uated as 
satisfactory by [CONTACT_223233] (IDMC) . The present 
study  will provide critical information on the safety  and immunogenicit y profile of 
the ChAd155- RSV vaccine before a subsequent trial in seronegative infants.
In Section [IP_ADDRESS] RSV serostatus using IBL International kit and choice of study 
population , the following changes have been made:
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_717492], a potential lack of 
sensitivity  of the IBL International kit compared to a RSV neutralization assay  has 
been reported [Malkin, 2013]. [COMPANY_004] considers that the specificity and sensitivity 
characteristics of the assay indicate a reduced a lower sensitivity  reduces the risk of 
enrolling RSV -seronegative infants identified RSV -seropositive in the assay (i.e. 
false RSV -seropositive infants results )and that this is acceptable in this screening 
context .
In Section [IP_ADDRESS] Staggered design with 3 steps ,the following change has been made:
Vaccination will be limited to a maximum of 10 infants per day. In the same 
investigational center, infants will be vaccinated sequentially , separated by  a 
minimum interval of 60 minutes to allow monitoring of an y acute events (e.g. 
hypersensitivity  reaction). In addition, to monitor delayed potential reactions 
following vaccination, there will be a [ADDRESS_978467] eight infants (corresponding to three to five 
ChAd155 -RSV  vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]) in each Step (1, 2, and 3) before continuin g 
vaccination of more infant (i.e. from the ninth infant). From the ninth infant, 
infants will be vaccinated sequentially, separated by a minimum interval of 60 
minutes. Refer to the study procedures manual (SPM) for more details about the 
48-hour observat ion period after the first eight subjects vaccinated in each Step.
Within each step, an internal Safet y Review Committee (iSRC) will review 
accumulated safet y data three weeks after the start of vaccination and then about 
every  three weeks (until the I ndep endent Data Monitoring Committee [ IDMC]
reviews the data). Ad -hoc iSRC meetings may  be held should safet y concerns 
warrant a safet y review. Refer to Section 9.10.2 for more information about iSRC.

10-DEC-2017 153In Section [IP_ADDRESS] Rationale for monitoring of hematology p arameters, the following 
changes have been made :
Emphasis on “minimal risk” is imperative for the protection of the pediatric 
population participating to research studies where blood sample volume limits is a 
critical parameter. To stay  within blood sampli ng limits that are consistent with 
physiological “minimal risk” in this y oung and vulnerable population, but also to 
minimize any  development of needle aversion, no blood draw will be performed for 
immunological assay s and for biochemistry  tests at Day  1 and none for hematology  
and biochemistry  tests at Day  3. Blood samples collected within the screening 
window (limited to maximum 14 day s)will serve as baseline for the immunological 
analysis and for the hematology  and biochemistry  check -up before vaccination. 
Consequently , the maximum blood draw volumes collected per protocol have been 
restricted to 9.0 mL within 24 hours and 32.4 mL over eight weeks (refer to Table 5 
and Table 7). Of note, it is considered that blood sample volumes ranging from 1 to 
5% of total blood volume within 24 hours and up to 10% of total blood volume over 
8 weeks are consistent with the limited evidence available on the minimal 
physiological risk for healthy  children [Howie; 2011]. The total blood volume of a 
child is around 75 to 8 0 mL /kg (85 to 105 mL /kg in the neonatal period). 
Considering a girl of 12 months of age with a low weight of 7.3 kg (5thpercentile 
[WHO; 2006]), the minimal individual total blood volume in the study  population 
would be 547.[ADDRESS_978468] been made :
When all data up to Day  60 are available, a statistical anal ysis will be performed. 
This anal ysis may  lead to the unblinding of some subjects. As a consequence, after 
Day 60, the study  cannot be considered as observer -blind, but will be conducted in a 
single -blind manner, with subjects’ parent(s)/ LAR(s) remaining blinded up to study  
end (Day  365730 ). The investigators will not have access to the treatment allocation 
up to study  end (Day  365730).
In Section 2.[ADDRESS_978469] been made :
To evaluate the safet y of two I M doses of three dose levels of the RSV 
investigational vaccine when administered according to a 0, 1 -month schedule from 
study  start (Day  0) up to study  conclusion (Day  365730) in RSV -seropositive infants 
aged 12 to 17 month s. 
To evaluate the occurrence of RSV respi[INVESTIGATOR_717497] -seropositive 
infants from Visit 1 (Day 0, after Dose 1) up to study  conclusion (Day  365730 ).

during the stud y has been updated in order to be consistent throughout the different RSV 
project documents.
Intracellular staining (ICS)
Within [ADDRESS_978501] phlebotomy, approximately 350 µL of undiluted whole blood are 
incubated at 37°C with the relevant antigen (in this case pools of 15 -mer peptides 
overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_10373] 11 amino acids and spanning the sequences of F, N, and M2 -1 
proteins), negative con trol (medium), or positive control (staphylococcal enterotoxin B) 
for 2 hours in the presence of anti- CD28 and anti -CD49d antibodies. Brefeldin A, a 
protein secretion inhibitor, is then added and the mix is incubated overni ght. Red cells 
are then lysed and white cells washed, fixed, cryopreserved, and stored until analysis by 
[CONTACT_448317].
Once ready for cytometry analysis, white cells are thawed in batches, washed, and 
incubated with fluorochrome -conjugated antibodies specific to CD4 and CD8 surface 
markers. Then, cells are permeabilized and stained with fluorochrome -conjugated 
antibodies specific for the following immune markers: For pediatric blood samples, 
undiluted whole blood is stimulated at 37°C with the relevant antigen –in this case 
peptide pools covering proteins F, N and M2 -1 - for 2 hours in the presence of anti- CD28 
and anti -CD49d antibodies. An inhibitor of intracellular protein transport (Brefeldin A) is 
added and cells are incubated overnight. Red cells are then lysed and white cells washed, 
fixed, cry opreserved, and stored until cy tometric analy sis.
Cells are subsequentl y thawed in batches, washed, and incubated with fluorochrome -
conjugated antibodies specific to CD3, CD4 and CD8 surface markers. Cells are then 
permeabilized and stained with fluorochrome -conjugated antibodies specific for immune 
markers such as IL-2, IFN -, TNF -, CD40L, IL -13, IL -17, and 41BB. After washing, 
flow cy tometric acquisition is performed and the results are expressed as the frequency  of 
CD4+ and CD8+ T -cells expressing an y cytokine or a combination of cy tokines.
Other immune markers could be added to characterize further the antigen -specific CD4+ 
or CD8+ T- cells.
After washing, acquisition of data is performed via a flow cytometer.
Theresults are expressed as the frequency of CD4 or CD8 T -cells expressing, per 
million of CD4 or CD8 T -cells:
At least one immune marker (to detect and measure the CD4 or CD8 T -cell 
response).
Any Th specific immune marker (to determine the Th profile of the CD4 response).

days. Virus- infected cells are detected b y an immunofluorescence assay , using a two- step 
detection sy stem with a primary  goat ant i-RSV antibody  and a secondary  fluorochrome -
tagged antibod y (anti -Goat IgG -FITC). This antibody  system detects host cell -associated 
RSV antigens and allows visualization of plaques appearing on the cell monolay er by  
[CONTACT_31122]. The viral plaques ar e counted as plaque -forming units using an 
automated microscope reader.
The serum neutralizing antibody  titer is reported as the inverse of the serum dilution 
which y ields a 60% reduction in the number of viral plaques compared to the virus 
control without serum (Effective Dose: ED60) First, virus neutralization is performed 
by [CONTACT_117838] a fixed amount of RSV -A long strain (ATCC No. VR -26) with serial 
dilutions of the test serum. Then, the serum-virus mixture is transferred onto a 
monolayer of Vero cells ( African Green Monkey, kidney, Cercopi[INVESTIGATOR_227203], ATCC 
CCL -81) and incubated for three days to allow infection of Vero cells by [CONTACT_105] -
neutralized viruses and the formation of plaques in the cell monolayer. Following the 
fixation period, RSV -infected cells are detected using a primary antibody directed 
against RSV (anti -RSV  IgG) and a secondary antibody conjugated with fluorescein 
isothiocyanate, allowing the visualization of plaques by [CONTACT_31122]. Viral 
plaques are counted using an automated micros cope coupled to an image analyzer 
(Scanlab system with Axiovision software). For each serum dilution, a ratio, expressed 
as a percentage, is calculated between the number of plaques at that dilution and the 
number of plaques in the virus control wells (no serum added). The serum neutralizing 
antibody titer is expressed in ED60 (Estimated Dilution 60) and corresponds to the 
inverse of the interpolated serum dilution that yields a 60% reduction in the number of 
plaques compared to the virus control wells as d escribed b y others [ Barbas , 1992; Bates , 
2014].
ELISA
Anti- RSV protein F ELISA
The anti -RSV protein F ELISA is an indirect ELISA allowing the detection and the 
quantification of specific IgG antibodies directed against the RSV F protein in 
human serum samples.
In summary , protein F antigen purified from Chinese Hamster Ovary  expression 
system is adsorbed onto a 96- well pol ystyrene microplate. After a washing and a 
blocking step, dilutions of serum samples, controls and standards are added to the 
coated microplate. After incubation, the microplate is washed to remove unbound 
primary  antibodies. Bound IgGs are detected b y the addition of a goat anti- human 
IgG antibod y, conjugated to horse -radish peroxidase. Bound antibodies are 
quantified by  [CONTACT_717599] o f the horse -radish peroxidase substrate, 
tetrameth ylbenzidine and hy drogen peroxide, whereby  a colored product develops 
proportionally  to the amount of anti -RSV PreF IgG antibodies present in the serum 
sample. The antibod y concentration is expressed in arb itrary  EU/mL .

quantified by [CONTACT_489784] [ADDRESS_978503] curve 
using a four -parameter equation and are expressed in arbitrary ELISA units

Palivizumab competitive assay
Palivizumab monoclonal antibody  (Synagis) is used as a passive treatment that 
protects against RSV infection by  [CONTACT_489783][INVESTIGATOR_489673] 
F antigen. The palivizumab competitive assay  is based on the competitive binding 
process between the labeled antibody  (biotiny lated palivizumab) and non- labeled 
antibody  (palivizumab -equivalent antibodies in serum used as reference) targeting 
the same epi[INVESTIGATOR_298089] a coated antigen. The results of the palivizumab competitive 
assay  ELISA are expressed as palivizumab equivalent antibodies i n µg/mL .
First, F protein antigens purified from CHO expression system are coated onto 96-
well microplates. Then, after a washing and a blocking step, serial two -fold 
dilutions of test sera, positive control serum, and palivizumab antibody reference 
standa rd are added in sequence with competitor antibodies (horseradish 
peroxidase- conjugated palivizumab) and incubated to allow specific binding of 
antibodies directed against the F protein antigens. If palivizumab -like antibodies 
are present in serum samples, they will compete with the horseradish peroxidase -
conjugated palivizumab antibodies for binding to the F protein coated antigen. 
After a washing step, the horseradish peroxidase substrate solution (TMB/H 2O2) is 
added and a colored product develops in a man ner that is inversely proportional to 
the amount of palivizumab-like antibodies contained in the test serum. The color is 
quantified by [CONTACT_489784] [ADDRESS_978504] curve using a 
four-parameter equation and are expressed as palivizumab -equivalent antibodies

designed in the RSV N gene, encoding the RSV nucleocapsid protein. The process 
involves nucleic acids extraction, conversion of RNA to complementary 
deoxyribonucleic acid by [CONTACT_334061] -time PCR 
reaction using a calibration curve (absolute quantitation). The RSV viral load is 
reported as copi[INVESTIGATOR_333946].
Qualitative multiplex PCR for detection of a panel of 17 viruses: xTAG™ RVP 
FAST assay :
xTAG™ RVP FAST assay  is a qualita tive nucleic acid multiplex tests intended for 
the simultaneous detection and identification of multiple respi[INVESTIGATOR_717532]/nasopharyngeal swabs from individuals suspected of respi[INVESTIGATOR_37193]. After nucleic acid extraction , a multiplexed PCR reaction is performed to 
amplify  the regions of interest in the targeted infectious agent genes. The PCR 
reaction product is then subjected to a hybridization/detection step and attached to an 
xTAG universal tag sequence. The 5’ univers al tag sequence is h ybridized to the 
complementary  anti-tag sequence coupled to a particular bead set. The hy bridized 
beads are detected and results are anal yzed by [CONTACT_717600].
After extraction of nucleic acids from the sample, a single mul tiplex RT -PCR is 
performed using random primers. Then, each complementary deoxyribonucleic 
acid is detected by [CONTACT_166193]-specific primers, each primer containing a unique tag 
sequence. A deoxyribonucleic acid polymerase extends the primer when there is a 
perfe ct match on the 3’ end of the virus specific primer. Biotin -dCTP is 
incorporated into the extending chain if extension occurs. 
Tagged amplified deoxyribonucleic acid is mixed with Luminex beads. These 
beads are coated with anti -tag oligonucleotides comple mentary to the tag 
sequences included in the virus- specific primers. These beads are colored making 
them spectrally distinguishable from each other. Each tagged primer hybridizes 
only to its unique anti -tag complement; therefore, each bead color represents a 
specific virus through the bead/anti -tag/tagged primer association. 
Revelation is performed by [CONTACT_2329] a fluorescent reporter molecule (streptavidin -
phycoerythrin) that binds to the Biotin -dCTP included in the extended sequences. 
The beads are then analy zed by [CONTACT_717601]®200 instrument which corresponds 
to a flow -cytometer containing two lasers: one laser allows identification of the 
color -coded bead associated to each virus and one laser allows identification of the 
presence or absence of extended prim er through the reporter molecule. The data 
generated by [CONTACT_717601]®200 system are expressed in Median Fluorescence 
Intensity units per bead, which are translated in a positive or negative status for 
each target.

Amendment date: 08 June 2017
Co-ordinating author:  (Scientific Writer, Keyrus Biopharma 
contractor for [COMPANY_004] Biologicals)
Rationale/background for changes:
!During initial implementation of this study, parents have given feedback that the 
number of visits and blood tests is challenging to accommodate with busy family 
schedules and is demanding for young children. This amendment reduces the burden on families whilst maintaining the intended close oversight of the potential risk of thrombocytopenia, by [CONTACT_717602]. Assessment of platelet counts (currently at Days 1, 7, 31 and 37) will now be repeated at Day 7 and/or Day 37 in those infants with a Grade 1 or greater abnormality detected at either Day 1 and/or Day 31. This is because the nadir of the platelet count occurred on the first day following dosing in the preclinical data. This modification of monitoring is judged by [CONTACT_41758] (IDMC) and [COMPANY_004] to be appropriate, as the sampling plan captures any potential initial fall and then subsequent recovery. The clinic visits at Day 3 and Day 33 including a clinical examination of the child for evidence of petechiae may be replaced by a phone call to inquire of the infants’ general health and to solicit reports of a rash, spontaneous bleeding or easy bruising, which are all indicative of thrombocytopenia. As an additional safety measure the subjects’ parent(s)/legally acceptable representative(s) (LAR[s]) will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_093]/study staff immediately if their child develops a rash, in order to detect any thrombocytopenic petechiae or purpura. This will supplement the current instruction to report spontaneous bleeding or easy bruising in the month following vaccination. As there is no absolute requirement for sampling for hematology on Day 7 or 37, the other tests of biochemistry and cell mediated immunity (CMI) are not requested under this amendment at these timepoints.
!It has been clarified that blood samples for CMI and for humoral immunogenicity 
may be postponed until after the RSV serostatus is known and eligibility is 
confirmed up to or on Day 0 (but before vaccination).
!The age range for enrolment has been expanded an additional 6 months, from 12 to 
17 months initially, to 12 to 23 months. These children are still at risk of respi[INVESTIGATOR_14256] (RSV) disease and could potentially benefit from this vaccine. This would also increase the number of subjects screened who are likely to be previously

number of failures to enroll after screening.
The following inclusion criterion has been removed, to be able to include those 
infants who despi[INVESTIGATOR_717533] c ourses: “Born full -term (i.e. after a gestation period of 37 to less than 42 
completed weeks) with a minimum birth weight of 2.5 kg”. Other criteria pertaining 
to current weight, health status of the child, and Synagis administration will exclude 
infants w ho have experienced prematurity  and its associated complications.
Because enrolment in the trial is slower than anticipated, the safet y monitoring 
oversight plan of the IDMC is adapted to provide regular review of accumulating

each dose level. Moving to a next dose level will be done in the absence of a safet y 
concern detected b y the IDMC on the four weekly reports and after administration of 
the vaccine to all [ADDRESS_978506] 16 subjects for two 
doses and given their formal approval prior to enrolling subjects to the next dose 
level.
To allow the extension of the recru itment network, some investigational sites without 
a laboratory  in proximity capable to perform the whole blood stimulation (WBS) 
necessary  for the CMI assay  will be allowed to participate. Therefore, blood 
sampling for the assessment of CMI  will only  be p erformed for subjects recruited in 
sites with a WBS capable laboratory  in proximity . 
The following minor changes and clarifications have been made:
Further clarification is made on which visits may  take place in the subject’s home as 
appropriate to the circumstances and in the judgment of the investigator (not allowed 
if blood sampling for immune response and/or vaccine administration). 
The priority  ranking in blood sampling is amended to hematology  > biochemistry  > 
humoral response > CMI response. This is primarily  a stud y of safet y and so 
venipuncture will not be repeated for CMI or humoral response in case of 
insufficient volume at any timepoint, i f safet y samples have been secured. 
Safety  data from study  201974 (RSV PED -001) in healthy adults have been added.
It has been clarified that RSV infections will be assessed using standardized case 
definitions based on the available World Health Organization (WHO) case 
definitions [Modjarrad, 2016].
Clarification on the reporting of temperature excursions has been added. 
Temperature excursion above -60°C and below -90°C for the ChAd155 -RSV vaccine 
should be reported.
The endpoints related to CMI  evaluation have been clarified.
The kit used for multiplex respi[INVESTIGATOR_717534].
In addition, some ty pos have been corrected and other administrative changes have 
been made throughout the protocol in order to add clarity .

!Study population : The immunogenicity, safety and 
reactogenicity of the pediatric candidate RSV vaccine 
(ChAd155-RSV vaccine) are currently being has been 
evaluated in healthy adult subjects aged 18 to 45 years (study 
201974 [RSV PED-001]). 
!Staggered design with 3 steps:
Within each step, a An internal Safety Review Committee 
(iSRC) will review all accumulating accumulated safety 
data three weeks after the start of vaccination and then about 
every three weeks until the IDMC reviews the data has 
reviewed all safety data up to 30 days after administration 
of Dose 2 in Step 3 (i.e. Day 60) .
The IDMC will review accumulating reactogenicity and 
safety data monthly throughout the period of vaccination (up to 30 days after administration of Dose 2 in Step 3, i.e. Day 60). The IDMC will also review incidence of all serious

RSV -RTI leading to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_717535]. 
Both iSRC and IDMC will receive critical safety data (i.e. 
SAEs and adverse events of specific interest) within 48 
hours upon [COMPANY_004] becoming aware of it.
The iSRC and IDMC will determine whether any of the 
predefined study holding rules are met. If this is the case, 
vaccination in the study will be immediately put on hold. At 
any time, the IDMC may recommend to the sponsor to 
suspend the enrolment to the study and/or vaccination 
based on the safety data regularly arising in this study.
Moving to a next step will be conditional to the favorable 
outcome of the evaluation of safet y data obtained up to 
7days after administration of the second vaccine dose in the 
previous step (for all subjects), performed b y an IDMC. Dose 
escalation will proceed after administration of the vaccine 
to all [ADDRESS_978509] 16 subjects for two doses and given their 
formal ap proval prior to enrolling subjects to the next dose 
level.

The immunogenicity, safety and reactogenicity of the pediatric candidate RSV vaccine 
(ChAd155- RSV  vaccine) have been evaluated in healthy adults aged 18 to 45 years 
(study 201974 [RSV PED- 001; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]]) There were no significant safety 
concerns identified up to Day 60 in study RSV PED -001. Overall, the ChAd155 -RSV  
vaccine high dose (Hd) (5 x 1010vp) seems to be more reactogenic (local and general) 
than the ChAd155- RSV vaccine low dose (Ld) (5 x 109vp), however, the reactogenicity 
profile was less than that observed in the Bexsero group. No safety signal from the 
assessed hematology parameters (hemoglobin, platelet count, prothrombin time and 
APTT) was observed in subjects receiving the ChAd155 -RSV  vaccine. No significant 
reductions in platelet count or clinically significant changes in coagulation parameters 
were observed up to [ADDRESS_978515] Dose 2. An approximately 2.4- fold increase in RSV -A 
neutralizing antibody titers (geometric mean titer [GMT] from baseline) was observed 
in both RSV -Ld and RSV -Hd af ter Dose 1. No booster effect was evident after Dose 2. 
An anti- F IgA and IgG antibody secreting B -cells response and an RSV F, N and M2-[ADDRESS_978516] dose were 
observed with ELISpot. There was no booster response after the second vaccination. 
There was no specific vaccine- induced CD4 T- cellular response observed with 
intracellular staining (ICS). For CD8 T- cells only a weak CD8 IFN -γ response to N 
was shown with ICS for some subjects.

(SAEs) and incidence of RSV -respi[INVESTIGATOR_6014] (RTI), RSV -LRTI, RSV -
severe LRTI and RSV -RTI leading to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_717538]. 
Both iSRC and IDMC will receive critical safety data (i.e. SAEs and adverse events of 
specific interest) within 48 hours upon [COMPANY_004] becoming aware of it.
The iSRC and IDMC will determine whether any of the prede fined study holding rules 
are met. If this is the case, vaccination in the study will be immediately put on hold. At 
any time, the IDMC may recommend to the sponsor to suspend the enrolment to the

previous step (for all subjects), performed b y an IDMC. Dose escalation will proceed 
after administration of the vaccine to all [ADDRESS_978518] 16 subjects for two doses and given their formal 
approval prior to enrolling subjects to the next dose level.
In Section [IP_ADDRESS]. Rationale for monitoring of hematology parameters, the following 
chang es have been made:
To stay  within blood sampling limits that are consistent with phy siological “minimal 
risk” in this y oung and vulnerable population, but also to minimize any  development of 
needle aversion, no blood draw will be performed for immunologica l assays and for 
biochemistry tests at Day 1 and none for hematology  and biochemistry  tests at Day  3
blood draws for the determination of hematological parameters are scheduled at Day 1 
and Day 31 (corresponding to the first day after administration of the vaccine). 
Additional specimens will be draw n if any ≥ Grade [ADDRESS_978519] been res tricted to 9.0 mL  within 24 hours and 32.4 26.2 mL over eight weeks (refer 
to Table 5 and Table 7 ). For investigational sites without a laboratory in proximity 
capable to perform whole blood stimulation [WBS] necessary for the CMI assay the 
volumes will be less.
In light of these data, a clinical examination with special attention given to the detection 
of spontaneous bleeding or eas y bruising and evidence of bruising or petechiae will be 
performed by [CONTACT_093]/study staff on Day  1, Day  3,and Day 7 , Day 31, Day 33 
and Day 37 after each vaccination . The visits on Day 3 and Day 33 may be replaced by a

Note that a broad safety hematology and biochemistry evaluation was performed at 
each study visit in adults during study RSV PED -001 (201974; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) . In this 
study, blood samples for hematology/biochemistry were taken from all subjects at all 
study visits, i.e. at Screening, on the day of vaccination (Day 0 and Day 30), [ADDRESS_978520] 
vaccination (Day 1 and Day 31), [ADDRESS_978521] vaccination (Day 3 and 33), [ADDRESS_978522]

at Day 7, the relevant hematology /biochemistry  parameter(s) must be re -tested 
before administration of vaccine Dose 2, either during an unscheduled visit or at 
the Dose 2 vaccination visit itself (provided results are obtained before 
vaccination). Onl y if the concerned parameter(s) is/are within the acceptable 
range (i.e. within normal range or Grade 1 without c linical relevance), vaccine 
Dose 2 can be administered. If the concerned parameter(s) is/are not within the 
acceptable range by [CONTACT_2006]  35 (which is the maximum within the allowed interval 
for the second dosing visit, Visit 5), the infant will not receive Dose 2 but should 
still continue the study  for safet y follow -up (up to Day  730).
at Days 1, 30, 31, 37 and 60 the relevant hematology /biochemistry  parameter(s)

Nasal swab and other specimen for local assay collected during assessment visit
If during passive or active surveillance contact, the investigator/study  staff assesses that 
an infant presents a potential RSV -RTI (refer to 9.2), a nasal swab and another specimen 
for local assay  will be collected during an assessment visit:
The na sal swab will allow assessing the potential RSV infection by  [CONTACT_4503]-
PCR at sponsor laboratory.
The specimen for local assay  will allow assessing the potential RSV infection and 
RVP at a local routine laboratory , where available. The specimen t ype will depend 
on the assay  run locally .
Nasal swab collected to detect asymptomatic RSV infections
During RSV season, there will be monthly  nasal swabs to detect as ymptomatic RSV 
infections. These nasal swab swill allow assessing the potential RSV infection by

Following total nucleic acids extraction, viruses are detected by [CONTACT_431937] -time 
RT-PCR assays targeting the above mentioned viruses. A comparative analysis of 
the fluorescence intensities of each target is performed to detect the viruses present 
in the sample.
 17 viruses: xTAG™ RVP FAST assay :
After extraction of nucleic acids from the sample, a single multiplex RT -PCR is 
performed using random primers. Then, each complementary  deox yribonucleic acid 
is detected b y virus -specif ic primers, each primer containing a unique tag sequence. 
A deox yribonucleic acid polymerase extends the primer when there is a perfect 
match on the 3’ end of the virus specific primer. Biotin-dCTP is incorporated into the 
extending chain if extension occu rs. 
Tagged amplified deox yribonucleic acid is mixed with L uminex beads. These beads 
are coated with anti -tag oligonucleotides complementary  to the tag sequences 
included in the virus -specific primers. These beads are colored making them 
spectrall y disting uishable from each other. Each tagged primer h ybridizes only  to its 
unique anti -tag complement; therefore, each bead color represents a specific virus 
through the bead/anti- tag/tagged primer association. 
Revelation is performed by  [CONTACT_2329] a fluorescent repo rter molecule (streptavidin -
phycoery thrin) that binds to the Biotin-dCTP included in the extended sequences. 
The beads are then anal yzed by  [CONTACT_717601]®200 instrument which corresponds to a 
flow-cytometer containing two lasers: one laser allows identifica tion of the color -
coded bead associated to each virus and one laser allows identification of the 
presence or absence of extended primer through the reporter molecule. The data 
generated b y the Luminex®200 sy stem are expressed in Median Fluorescence 
Intens ity units per bead, which are translated in a positive or negative status for each 
target.

Rationale/background for changes:
!An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) is reviewing all accumulating
unblinded safety and reactogenicity data on a monthly basis for this study to ensure 
that there is a timely identification of any safety signal. As safety data accumulates, it may be that there is sufficient evidence of safety of the current dose level to allow progression to the next dose level. For instance, taking the a priori safety concern of 
thrombocytopenia, this amendment will apply both Frequentist and Bayesian approaches to the existing data, as described in Section 11.[ADDRESS_978581] 16 subjects, without requiring the enrolment and evaluation of the full group size of 32 subjects. These amendment changes were implemented in the Synopsis and Synopsis Table 1, as well as Sections [IP_ADDRESS], [IP_ADDRESS], 1.3, Figure 1 in Section 3, Table 1 in Section 3, Sections 5.1, [IP_ADDRESS].1, Table 7 in 6.7.2, Table 11 in Section 6.7.3, Table 12 and Table 13 in Section [IP_ADDRESS], and in Sections 9.10.4 and 11.4.
!A footnote was added to indicate the requirement to record the white blood cell 
differential including absolute neutrophil and lymphocyte counts in the eCRF to 
Table 11 in Section 6.7.3 and the toxicity grading scales for the absolute neutrophil and lymphocyte counts were indicated in Table 25 of Appendix C.

cohort/Step, randomized 1:1 to vaccine or placebo, was based on conventional study 
designs for Phase 1/[ADDRESS_978597], two -sided 95% confidence interval (CI) would rule 
out an AE rate of 20% or more; if the incidence rate of AE sis more than 10%, there 
will still be more than an 80% chance of observing at least one subject with this AE. 
Combining all RSV vaccinees across all dose lev els, there will be more than a 99% 
chance of observing at least one subject with this AE.
Furthermore, with 16 RSV vaccine es,the maximum width of a 95% CI for the 
proportion of subjects with adverse events among 16 vaccinees is about 50% (see 
Figure 5).
Considering the sample size of 16 subjects in each study group, Figure 5illustrates the

If we assume platelet counts in healthy infants between 12 and 23 months follow a 
normal distribution with a mean of 300,000 platelets/ mm³ and a standard deviation of 
75,000 platelets/ mm³, then we would expect 0.04% of unvaccinated infants to h ave a 
count below [ZIP_CODE] platelets/ mm³, which is the cut -off for a Grade 3 thrombocytopenia. 
To rule out a four -fold or greater increase, we would need to show that the mean 
platelet count does not fall below 190,000 platelets/ mm³ with a standard deviation of 
47,500. The sample size needed to rule out a 110,000 platelets/ mm³ decrease due to

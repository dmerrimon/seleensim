subject-reported outcomes, defined as  the earliest time at which a 20% 
improvement is seen in the average post-t reatment score with no worsening of any 
single component score). 
o For all subjects (2 to 17 years of age) :  investigator assessment and scoring 
of cutaneous, abdominal, and laryngeal symptoms of acute HAE attacks by [CONTACT_2413]-rated symptom score. 
o For subjects ≥4 years of age only:  subject self-assessment of HAE-related 
pain using the Faces Pain Scale-Revised (FPS-R). 
• The time to minimal symptoms, defined as all symptoms mild or absent based on 
the investigator-rated symptom score.

• The proportion of subjects with worsened intensity of clinical HAE 
symptoms between 2 and 4 hours after treatment with SC icatibant using 
investigator-rated symptom scores. 
• The levels of reproductive hormones (f ollicle stimulating hormone [FSH], 
luteinizing hormone [LH], estradiol, progesterone in females and FSH, LH, and 
testosterone in males). 
Study Population:  
The study will enroll approximately [ADDRESS_108139] enrollment will be stratified into 2 groups based on Tanner Staging:  a prepubertal 
group (defined as Tanner stage I) and a pube rtal/postpubertal group (defined as Tanner 
stages II to V).  A subject’s cl assification as prepubertal or pubertal/postpubertal will be 
determined at the time of the subject’s first attack.  
Study Design: 
This is an open-label, non-randomized, single- arm study to evaluate the PK, tolerability, 
and safety, including reproductive hormone asse ssments, of a single SC administration of 
icatibant in up to approximat ely 36 pediatric subjects with HAE during an initial acute 
attack.  The study is planned to enroll  up to approximately 16 prepubertal and 
20 pubertal/postpubertal subjects who are from  2 through 17 years of age and who present 
with an acute cutaneous, abdomin al, or laryngeal HAE attack.  
After treatment for an initial attack, further open-label treatment w ith icatibant will be 
offered to pubertal/postpubertal subjects contingent upon having been treated previously 
and presenting with a subsequent acute cutaneous, abdominal, or laryngeal attack of HAE 
Icatibant (Firazyr®) 
Clinical Trial Protocol: HGT-FIR-[ADDRESS_108140] 
15 pubertal/postpubertal subjects have been treat ed with icatibant for a total of 3 attacks 
each.  Tolerability and safety evaluations, including reproductive hormone assessments, 
will be performed at each subsequent icatibant-treated attack in a manner similar to that performed for the initial treated attack. 
Study Duration: 
Once subject eligibility is established at screening, the minimal planned duration of 
participation for subjects who present with an initial attack of acute HAE will be 
approximately [ADDRESS_108141] of tr eatment with a single SC administration of 
icatibant on Day 1 and a 90-day follow-up period after treatment.  
Subjects will be closely monitored in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/study center for at  least 6-[ADDRESS_108142]’s condition at [ADDRESS_108143] 15 pubertal/postpubertal subjects 
who present with subsequent attacks of acute HAE may continue to receive treatment with 
icatibant for a total of [ADDRESS_108144] and the twentieth pubertal/ postpubertal subject 
have completed the Day 90 follow-up after treatme nt for an initial attack, and the fifteenth 
pubertal/postpubertal subject has completed th e Day [ADDRESS_108145] and final 
treatment, the study will be closed.   
Study Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria: 
Subjects must meet all of the following criteria to be considered eligible for enrollment: 
1. Two through 17 years of age, inclusive (ie,  from the second birthday through the day 
prior to the eighteenth birthday) at the time of the subject’s first attack. 
2. Documented diagnosis of HAE type I or II.  Diagnosis must be confirmed by 
[CONTACT_98252]/or functional C1 inhibitor (C1-INH) deficiency results 
(<50% of normal levels).  Diagnosis may be  on the basis of historic data or by 
[CONTACT_98253]. 
3. Informed consent (and subject assent as appr opriate) signed by [CONTACT_423]’s parent or 
legal guardian. 
 Subjects will be excluded from the study if  there is evidence of  any of the following 
criteria at screening or at any time prior to the time of the first attack: 
1. Diagnosis of angioedema other than HAE. 
2. Participation in another clinical study during the 30 days prior to treatment.  
3. Any known factor/disease that might interfere with the treatment compliance, study 
conduct, or result interpretation. 
4. Congenital or acquired cardiac anomalies th at interfere significantly with cardiac 
function. 
5. Treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors within 7 days prior to 
treatment. 
6. Use of hormonal contraception within the 90 days prior to treatment.

Clinical Trial Protocol: HGT-FIR-[ADDRESS_108146] is pregnant  or breastfeeding.   
 
Pharmacokinetic Variables: 
PK variables will be determined by [CONTACT_98254], and elsewhere by [CONTACT_98255] (at least 4 to 7 time points) and a population 
PK approach using non-linear mixed effects modeling software.   
PK parameter estimates will include, where appropriate:  actual icatibant and metabolite 
concentrations at each sampling tim e, time to peak concentration (T max), actual peak 
(Cmax) and minimum (C min) concentrations, clearance (CL/ F), actual area under the plasma 
concentration-time curve (AUC 0-last and AUC 0-inf), mean residence time (MRT), volume of 
distribution at steady state (V ss/F) and elimination half-life (t 1/2). 
Safety Assessments: 
Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_98256], vital signs, 
clinical laboratory evaluations (clinical chemistry [including liver function tests], 
hematology, urinalysis), and immunogenicity  (presence of anti-i catibant antibodies), 
recording of concomitant medications, and monito ring of AEs.  Local tolerability will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_98257] (injection site).  
Efficacy Assessments:   
Efficacy will be assessed using both inves tigator- and subject-reported outcomes, 
depending on the subject’s age.  Investigators will assess and score symptoms of acute 
cutaneous, abdominal, and laryngeal atta cks of HAE for all subjects using an 
investigator-rated symptom score.  Subjects who are 4 years of age or older will perform a self-assessment of HAE-related pain using the Faces Pain Scale-Revised (FPS-R).  
Subjects who are below 4 years of age will ha ve symptoms assessed by [CONTACT_98258].  The time of initial symptom relief as assessed by [CONTACT_98259].  
Reproductive Hormone Assessments: 
Levels of reproductive hormones will be assessed in female (FSH, LH, estradiol, 
progesterone) and male (FSH, LH, and testosterone) subjects.  
Statistical Methods:  
Summary statistics for continuous variables will include the nu mber of subjects, the mean, 
median, standard deviation, and range.  For PK parameters, the coefficient of variation 
and geometric mean also will be provided.  For categorical data, summaries will include counts and percentages.  For time-to-event data, the median time to event and other summary statistics will be estima ted using Kaplan-Meier methodology. 
The following populations will be used in the analysis: 
• The Initial Non-laryngeal Tr eatment Population will cons ist of those subjects who 
were treated with icatibant for their initi al attack and whose primary symptom was 
either cutaneous or abdominal.  
• The Second Non-laryngeal Treatment Popul ation will consist of those subjects 
who had a second icatibant- treated attack for which the primary symptom was 
either cutaneous or abdominal, regardless of the primary symptom for the initial attack. 
Icatibant (Firazyr®) 
Clinical Trial Protocol: HGT-FIR-086 14 June 2011 
Shire Confidential 6 • The Third Non-laryngeal Treatment Population will consist of those subjects who 
had a third icatibant-treated attack, for which the primary symptom was either 
cutaneous or abdominal, regardless of the primary symptom for the initial attack. 
• The Laryngeal Population will consist of those subjects who were treated with 
icatibant for any attack for which the primary symptom was laryngeal.  
• The PK Population will consist of those s ubjects who were treated with icatibant 
for their initial attack and who had at least [ADDRESS_108147]-treatment icatibant concentration recorded.   
• The Initial Treatment Population will cons ist of those subjects who were treated 
with icatibant for the initial attack.  Safe ty and tolerability analyses will use this 
population. 
• The Additional Treatment Population will c onsist of those pubertal/post-pubertal 
subjects who were treated with icatibant for more than [ADDRESS_108148]-treatment at which there is a 20% im provement in the average post-treatment 
symptom score with no worsening of any si ngle component score.  The efficacy data 
associated with the laryngeal attacks will be provided in data listings for the Laryngeal 
Population. 
Plasma concentrations of icatibant by [CONTACT_98260]. 
The assessment of safety will be based mainly on the frequency of AEs.  AEs will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_98261] (AE), having an AE in each body system, and having each individual AE using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activity (M edDRA).  The total number of AEs within 
each of these categories will be  reported.  AEs also will be  tabulated by [CONTACT_98262]. 
Local tolerability will include symptoms at the injection site and will be assessed 
separately from general reports of AEs.  Local tolerability will be tabulated and 
summarized according to the type and severity of attack. 
The change from baseline in the secretion of reproductive hormones and the change from 
baseline in HAE symptoms (as reported by [CONTACT_36305]) will be summarized 
descriptively.

Shire Confidential 13 1 INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Disease Background 
Bradykinin is responsible for the clinical symp toms of hereditary angioedema (HAE), causing 
increased vascular permeability, vasodilation, and cont raction of visceral smooth muscle.  HAE 
is a rare autosomal dominant disorder charact erized clinically by [CONTACT_98263]-limiting 
attacks of edema of the skin, gastrointestinal tr act, and larynx.  Its prevalence is estimated at 
1:10,000 to 1:50,000.1   
The disease is generally caused by [CONTACT_5640] a qu antitative (Type I) or qualitative (Type II) 
deficiency of C1 inhibitor.  The functions of C1 inhibitor include the prevention of C1 
complement auto-activation, inactivation of coagul ation factors XIIa, XIIf, XIa, and inhibition of 
activated kallikrein.  After a tri ggering event, the deficiency in C1  inhibitor results in accelerated 
release of bradykinin, the principal mediator of the increased va scular permeability characteristic 
of HAE, by [CONTACT_98264], activated 
kallikrein.  There is a third, more rare type of HAE (Type  III) which is of unknown etiology and 
pathophysiology and thus will not be considered further here. 
Icatibant is a synthetic decapeptide with a structure similar to bradykinin that acts as an 
antagonist of the bradykinin B2 receptor.2, 3  It is highly specific for the B2 receptor, and is 
characterized by [CONTACT_98265], and sufficient biological half-life to allow systemic administration by s ubcutaneous (SC) injection.
4, [ADDRESS_108160] likely related to the many physiological (endocrine, mental, and somatic) changes occurring during these periods of development.  In the gastrointestinal tract, submucosal edema may be associated with colicky abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.  Though 
infrequent compared to cutaneous and abdominal manifestations, attacks of acute HAE involving 
the larynx may result in submucosal edema of the upper airways and risk of death by [CONTACT_98266]/or untreated.  In  comparison to adults asphyxia may ensue more 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_98232].

Icatibant (Firazyr®) 
Clinical Trial Protocol: HGT-FIR-086 14 June 2011 
Shire Confidential 14 Prompt control of attacks, short-term prophylaxis, and intermittent therapy are recommended for 
the management of pediatric HAE.6  Treatment options for children with HAE according to 
current guidelines include antifibrinolytics, atte nuated androgens, and C1 inhibitor (C1-INH) 
replacement therapy.  Antifibrinolytics are ge nerally preferred (eg, tranexamic acid) for 
long-term prophylaxis because of their comparatively favorable safety profile relative to attenuated androgens; though their efficacy may be limited.  C1-INH replacement therapy has been used successfully for management of acute attacks of HAE in children; however, its use in 
children is associated with the same drawbacks (ie, requirement for intravenous [IV] administration, potential to elic it hypersensitivity reactions, po ssible transmission of blood-borne 
infectious agents) as in adults. 
1.2 Previous Clinical Studies 
1.2.1 Pharmacokinetics of Icatibant 
The pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of icatibant have been charac terized extensively in studies 
using both IV and SC administration to healthy adult subjects and adult subjects with HAE.  The 
PK profile of icatibant in adu lts with HAE (JE049-2101 Clinical Study Report) is similar to that 
in healthy adults. 
After SC administration of a single 30 mg dose of  icatibant to healthy adult subjects (N=96), a 
mean (± standard deviation) maximum plasma concentration (C max) of 974 ± 280 ng/mL was 
observed after approximately 0.75 hours.  The mean area under the concentration-time curve 
(AUC 0-∞) after a single 30 mg dose was 2165 ± 568 ng• hr/mL, with no evidence of accumulation 
of icatibant afte r three 30 mg doses administered 6 hours apart.   
Plasma clearance after SC administration of icatibant was 245 ± 58 mL/min with a mean 
elimination half-life of 1.4 ± 0.4 hours a nd volume of distribution at steady state (V ss) of 
29.0 ± 8.[ADDRESS_108161] demographics, including age, sex, and body weight.  
Icatibant is extensively metabolized by [CONTACT_98267], with less than 10% of the dose eliminated as unchanged drug.  
Icatibant is not degraded by [CONTACT_98268], and is not an  inhibitor of major 
cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzymes (CYP 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 
3A4) and is not an inducer of CYP 1A2 and 3A4. 
Clinical PK studies demonstrate that for mild to moderate impairment of renal or hepatic 
function no dose adjustment is necessary.  In 10 subjects with hepatorenal syndrome (glomerular filtration rate (GFR) 30 to 60 mL/min), clearance of icatibant was not dependent on renal function.  Icatibant cl earance in subjects with a wide range  of hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh 
score ≥7 and ≤15) was similar to that in healthy subjects. 
1.2.2 Phase III Investigation of SC Icatibant 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_98233], a comprehensive da ta set supports the efficacy and safety of SC 
icatibant.   
Icatibant (Firazyr®) 
Clinical Trial Protocol: HGT-FIR-[ADDRESS_108162] been treated with icatibant when self administered by [CONTACT_1962] (Integrated Summary of 
Safety 11 January 2011).  
In integrated analyses of pooled data from  3 controlled Phase III studies (HGT-FIR-054, 
JE049-2102, and JE049-2103), icatibant significantly decreased the time to onset of symptom 
relief for cutaneous and abdominal attacks relativ e to comparator agents (placebo, tranexamic 
acid) as demonstrated by [CONTACT_98269]-laryngeal symptoms randomized to double-blind treatment.  Moreover, the median time to onset of symptom relief after icatibant treatment was consistent across all of the controlled Phase III studies and across the 2 endpoints, rangi ng from 1.5 to 2.3 hours.  Likewise, icatibant 
showed effectiveness in the treatment of laryngeal attacks.   
The recommended dose of icatibant in adults is 1 SC injection of 3 mL (3 0 mg) administered in 
the abdominal area for the treatment of acute atta cks of HAE.  In case of insufficient relief or 
recurrence of symptoms, a second   injection of i catibant can be administered after 6 hours.  No 
more than 3 injections of icatib ant should be administered in a 24 hour period.  In clinical trials, 
a single SC injection of icatiban t was generally sufficient to treat an acute HAE attack.  No 
differences in the efficacy or safety of icatiban t in clinical trials ha ve been observed between 
sexes; therefore, dose adjustments for adult male s or females are not considered necessary.  
Beyond exposure in clinical studies , it is estimated that over 8000 patient exposures to Firazyr
® 
have occurred cumulatively in the postmarketing setting from the time of European Union 
regulatory approval in July 2008 through January 2011. 
Please refer to the current edition of the Investigator’s Brochure for further information

Icatibant (Firazyr®) 
Clinical Trial Protocol: HGT-FIR-086 14 June 2011 
Shire Confidential 16 A retrospective analysis, prompted by [CONTACT_98270], of serum levels of gonadotrophic 
hormone levels (follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH ] and luteinizing hormone [LH]) in male and 
female healthy volunteers in an Phase I st udy (JE049-1103) showed no clinically important 
changes from baseline in levels of follicle-st imulating hormone [FSH] and luteinizing hormone 
[LH] after administration of 3 SC doses (30 mg each) of icatibant 6 hours apart on Day 1 
followed by [CONTACT_98271] (30 mg) on Day 8 and Day 15.  
Phase 1 study (HGT-FIR-062) is a double-bli nd, randomized, placebo-controlled, single center 
study to assess the effect of i catibant on serum reproductive hormone levels in male and 
premenopausal female healthy adult subjects and seminal fluid analysis in healthy male adult 
subjects.  This study is intended to definitively de termine the effect of repeated administration of 
3 SC doses of icatibant 30 mg on reproductive  hormone levels in adults prior to any 
investigational use in pediatric subjects per the recomme ndation of the European Medicines 
Agency (EMA).  Subjects are randomized to receiv e icatibant or placebo as a single SC injection 
at 6 hour intervals 3 times daily on Days 1, 4, a nd 7 of the treatment week (total 9 doses/week) 
with an approximately [ADDRESS_108164] been enrolled and 
treated; [ADDRESS_108165] comple ted the study ([ADDRESS_108166] did not return for follow-up).  The 
results will be reported in the final clinical study report.   
1.[ADDRESS_108167] s in the proposed study will receive a single, 
weight-adjusted dose of 0.4 mg/kg per attack as a SC injection up to a maximum dose of 30 mg.  
This dose regimen was selected  to target an exposure (C max and area under the curve [AUC]) 
comparable to that observed in adults treated w ith icatibant.  Only 1 dose of icatibant will be 
permitted for treatment of a single attack.    
The 0.4 mg/kg dose was derived from pharmaco kinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) modeling of 
data from a study (JE049-1001) which investigated th e inhibitory potential of icatibant at various 
IV infusion doses and regimens after bradykinin ch allenge in healthy male subjects.  The PK and 
PD data sets were used to model the PK/PD relationship of icatibant using a sigmoidal E max 
model.  A high degree of concordance of half maximal effective concentration (EC 50) values was 
obtained for each of the PD parameters studie d (heart rate, blood pressure, and cutaneous blood 
flow) with the majority of values being between 8.54 and 9.77 ng/mL.  Thus, a mean EC 50 value 
of 9.5 ng/mL (7.3 nM) was used for subse quent PK/PD simulation.  Based on the PK/PD 
modeling, IV icatibant doses of 0.4 mg/kg and 0. 8 mg/kg were predicted to provide duration of 
therapeutic effect of as much as 9 or 13 hours, respectively, when infused over 0.5 to 1 hour.  
These results supported a minimum e ffective dose of 0.4 mg/kg to treat acute attacks of HAE.  
This corresponds to a dose of [ADDRESS_108168].   
A subsequent Phase II (JE049-2101) dose-rangi ng proof of concept efficacy study in HAE 
subjects was then conducted that examined the ef ficacy of doses ranging from 0.4 to 0.8 mg/kg 
IV (ie, 30 to 60 mg in a 75 kg person) and 30 to 45 mg SC.  The results of  this study indicated 
that SC administration of icatibant 30 mg produced a rapid onset of symptom relief and that 
45 mg SC showed no improvement in efficacy over 30 mg SC.

Clinical Trial Protocol: HGT-FIR-086 14 June 2011 
Shire Confidential 17 As a result of clinical exploration of the e fficacy, safety and exposure-response relationship of 
icatibant, a single SC administration of 30 mg icatibant (10 mg /mL formulation) was selected 
and consistently employed in the Phase III studies in adult HAE subjects.  The totality of 
available efficacy information obtained from the Phase III clinical studies demonstrates that a 
single SC [ADDRESS_108169] to 
clinically manage the majority of acute attacks in adult HAE s ubjects across a wide range of 
demographics.  Therefore, 0.4 mg/kg SC is considered an appropriate dose to study the tolerability, safety and PK of icatibant in the pediatric population.

Shire Confidential 21 Diagnosis may be supported by [CONTACT_98273], characteristic attack manifestations, and 
recurrence of attacks.  Assessments performed at screening will include demography, medical 
history, history of HAE, concomitant medication us e, physical examination (including height and 
weight), vital signs, urine pre gnancy test in female pubertal/p ostpubertal subjects, and blood 
sample collection for C1-INH testing.  
In previously screened, eligible subjects who present with an attack of acute HAE, baseline 
clinical assessments for PK, safety, and efficacy  will be performed on Day 1 at pretreatment.  
The initial severity and type of attack (ie, cu taneous, abdominal, or laryngeal) will be determined 
by [CONTACT_093].  The investigator will complete  baseline assessments at pretreatment of the 
symptoms of the acute HAE attack, and adhere nce to inclusion/exclusion criteria will be 
re-confirmed.  Subjects who are 4 years of ag e or older will perform a self-assessment of 
HAE-related pain.  Other baseline assessments pe rformed at pretreatment will include physical 
examination, height and weight, vital signs, coll ection of samples for clinical laboratory tests 
(serum chemistry [including liver function tests], hematology, and urinalysis), urine pregnancy 
test for pubertal/postpubertal females, baseline PK and immunogenicity evaluations, and baseline 
assessment of reproductive hormones (FSH, LH, es tradiol, progesterone in  females and FSH, 
LH, and testosterone in males).   
On Day 1, subjects will be administered a single dose of icatibant administered as a SC injection 
within 12 hours after the onset of the acute atta ck.  Subjects will be monitored closely at the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/study center for approximately 6 hours (prepubertal subjects) or 8 hours 
(pubertal/postpubertal subjects) af ter treatment.  Subj ects will be discharged after completion of 
scheduled assessments and when, according to th e investigator’s judgment, they are deemed 
medically stable.  Follow-up to assess the su bject’s condition at 24 hours (±4 hours) and 48 
hours (±4 hours) after discharg e will be conducted in person or  via a telephone call by [CONTACT_25617]. The time of study drug administration on Day [ADDRESS_108175]-treatment 
assessments will be calculated from the time of study drug administration.  Blood samples for 
PK evaluation in pubertal/postpubertal subjects  will be collected on Day 1 at pretreatment, 
15 (±5) minutes, 30 (±5) minutes, 45 (± 5) minutes, 1 (±0.17) hour, 2 (±0.17) 
hours, 4 (±0.5) hours, 6 (±0.5), and 8 (±0.5) hours after treatment with study drug.  In 
prepubertal subjects, blood samples for PK evalua tion will be collected on Day 1 at pretreatment, 
15 (±5) minutes, 30 (±5) minutes, 2 (±0.5) hour s, 4 (±0.5) hours, and 6 (±0.5) hours.  
Safety and efficacy assessments will be performe d on Day 1 up to 6 hours after treatment.  These 
assessments will include physical examination, vital signs, clinical laboratory tests (serum chemistry [including liver function tests], hematology, and urinalysis), and assessment of reproductive hormones (FSH, LH, estradiol, and progesterone in females and FSH, LH, and testosterone in males) in all subjects.  Injec tion site reactions will be evaluated on Day [ADDRESS_108176] who are 4 years of age or older

Subjects will undergo safety assessments, including physical examination, vital signs, and 
clinical laboratory tests (serum chemistry, hema tology, and urinalysis), evaluation of injection 
site reactions, immunogenicity, and measurem ent of reproductive hormones, as well as 
investigator assessments and subj ect self assessments (subjects ≥4 years of age only) of HAE 
symptoms on Day 8 after treatment. 
Subjects will be followed over a 90-day (±7 days) period after initial treatment.  All subjects will 
provide blood samples for immunogenicity tes ting and determination of reproductive hormone 
levels at the Day 90 visit and undergo safety assessments includi ng physical examination, vital 
signs, and clinical laboratory tests (serum chemis try, hematology, and urinalysis).  Additionally, 
pubertal/postpubertal females will undergo urine pregnancy testing. 
Pubertal/postpubertal subjects may receive further treatment with icatibant for up to 2 additional 
attacks of acute HAE.  Safety, reproductive hormone, and other a ssessments in association with 
subsequent attacks of acute HAE will be performed 90 days (±7 days) after treatment.  Each treatment for a subsequent attack will require a Day 90 follow up visit.  If a subsequent attack 
occurs within 7 days of the Day 90 follow-up vi sit for the previous attack, the assessments on 
Day 8 and Day 90 will be combined.   
Adverse events (AEs) and concomitant medication will be collected throughout the study.   All assessments are outlined in full in the Schedule of Events in Appendix 1, Initial

Shire Confidential 25 6 STUDY TREATMENT(S) 
6.1 Description of Treatment(s) 
6.1.[ADDRESS_108185] 
Icatibant is prepared as a steril e, isotonic, and acetate buffer so lution containing sodium chloride, 
acetic acid, sodium hydroxide and water fo r SC injection, adjusted to pH 5.5 ± 0.3.  The solution 
does not contain any preservative.   
The product is supplied as a 10 mg/mL (free ba se) solution in 3-mL glass syringes, with 
elastomeric stoppers, tip cap, plunger rod, and ba ckstop.  A fluid-dispensing connector will be 
used to secure a 1-mL or 3-mL syringe to the glass syringe.  A single dose (see Section 6.2) will 
be withdrawn and administered by [CONTACT_10530]. 
6.1.2 Comparator 
Not applicable to this study. 
6.2 Treatment(s) Administered 
All subjects will receive treatment with icatibant for an initial acu te attack of HAE as a single, 
weight-adjusted dose of 0.4 mg/kg up to a maximu m of 30 mg administered as a SC injection. 
Subsequent treatment with icatibant for up to 2 ad ditional attacks of acute HAE will be offered to 
pubertal/postpubertal subjects who pres ent with a new attack at least 7 days after prior treatment.  
The dosing regimen for treatment of subsequent atta cks will be the same as that for treatment of 
the initial attack (ie, a single weight-adjusted dose of 0.4 mg/kg up to a maximum of 30 mg per 
attack administered as a SC injection).  Thus, no more than [ADDRESS_108186] will be administered a single dose of  icatibant as a SC injection within 12 hours 
after the onset of an acute HAE attack.  Subsequent treatment with icatibant for up to 2 additional attacks of acute HAE for a total of 3 attacks will be  offered to pubertal/postpubertal 
subjects who have been previously treated and w ho present with another attack at least [ADDRESS_108187]-treatment with study drug.

Shire Confidential 26 6.6 Concomitant Medications 
Use of the following concomitant medica tions is allowed during the study: 
• All chronically administered medications, except for treatments of HAE, are allowed, but the 
dose and regimen must have been stable for at  least [ADDRESS_108188] dose of study 
drug. 
• Prophylactic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_98234] (eg, anti-fibri nolytics or C1-INH) other than attenuated 
androgens will be allowed, but therapi[INVESTIGATOR_98235] (eg, 
C1-INH concentrate, fresh-frozen plasma [FFP]) must not be used during the attack being 
treated with icatibant unless these are required as  rescue medications (see Section 6.7).  An 
exception is that fibrinolysis inhibitors may be given in a subject’s usual, stable prophylactic 
regimen.  
 Use of the following concomitant medica tions is forbidden during the study: 
• ACE inhibitors. 
• Androgens or attenuated androgens (e g, stanozolol, danazol, oxandrolone, 
methyltestosterone, testosterone). 
• Hormonal contraceptives (acceptable cont raception during the study for sexually active 
females will consist of abstinence or a doubl e barrier method such as condom plus 
diaphragm, condom or diaphragm plus spermici de, condom or diaphragm plus intrauterine 
device). 
 
6.7 Rescue Therapy 
For the purposes of this protocol, rescue thera py is any medication used after the administration 
of icatibant which, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_98236], is immediately nece ssary to alleviate acute 
symptoms which are judged by [CONTACT_98277].  Repeat 
administration of icatibant for a single at tack is not allowed in this study.   
The determination of the necessity for pain medication or other rescue therapy will be at the discretion of the investigator.  If pain medication is required, the investigator may administer 
morphine sulfate at a dose of 0.05 mg/kg or an equivalent low dose narcotic.  Antiemetics may 
also be prescribed as necessary  to treat nausea.  Other accepta ble rescue therapi[INVESTIGATOR_98237], 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], C1-INH if available and intrav enous or prescription- strength non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).  Medications provided for rescue therapy will be denoted as rescue medications on the appropriate case report form (CRF). 
Antihistamines (diphenhydramine, loratadine, cetiriz ine, etc) and glucocor ticoids are considered 
ineffective for the alleviation of an acute HAE att ack.  If administered during an acute attack that 
occurs during the study, they s hould be recorded as concomitant  medications but will not be 
considered as rescue medications.   If rescue medication is provided, the investig ator will document the drug name, amount, time, 
route of administration, freque ncy, and duration administered.

The investigator will use a symptom score to assess the severities of symptoms of acute 
cutaneous, abdominal, and laryngeal attacks of HAE using th e following 5-point scale.  
Symptom scores will be recorded on Day 1 at pretreatment and at predetermined time points 
after treatment.  Results will be recorded on the CRF. 
Investigator-rated Symptom Score  
0 = none; absence of symptoms 
1 = mild (no to mild interference with daily activities) 2 = moderate (moderate interference with daily activities) 3 = severe (severe interference with daily activities) 4 = very severe (very severe interference with daily activities) 
 For attacks classified as cutaneous and/or abdom inal, investigator-rated symptom scores will be 
collected for 8 symptoms:  abdominal tendern ess, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, skin pain, 
erythema, skin irritation, and skin swelling.   
For attacks classified as laryngeal, investigator-assessed symptom scores will be collected for 
13 symptoms:  abdominal tenderness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, skin pain, erythema, skin irritation, skin swelling, dysphagia, voice chan ge, breathing difficulties, stridor, and asphyxia.   
7.10.[ADDRESS_108199] 4 years of age will self assess HAE-related pain using the Faces Pain Scale-Revised (FPS-R).  A copy of the FPS-R is provided in Appendix 3 . 
Self-assessment results will be recorded in th e diary.  The self-assessment diaries will be 
provided to these subjects on Da y 1 at pretreatment and at pr edetermined time points after 
treatment while at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/study center and af ter their discharge.  Subjects will return the 
diary at the next scheduled visi t on Day 8.  Subjects will receive detailed instructions on when 
and how to complete the diaries by [CONTACT_98281]/or clinical site personnel. 
7.10.3  Initial Symptom Relief

7.15 Adverse Events Assessments   
7.15.1  Definitions of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events 
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event 
An AE is any noxious, pathologic, or uninte nded change in anatomical, physiologic, or 
metabolic function as indicated by [CONTACT_30597] , symptoms, or laboratory changes occurring in 
any phase of a clinical study, whether or not co nsidered investigational product-related.  This 
includes an exacerbation of a pre-existing condition.   
AEs include: 
• Worsening (change in nature, severity, or freque ncy) of conditions presen t at the onset of the 
study. 
• Intercurrent illnesses. 
• Drug interactions. 
• Events related to or possibly related to concomitant medications. 
• Abnormal laboratory values (this includes significa nt shifts from baselin e within the range of 
normal that the investigator considers to be clinically important). 
• Clinically significant abnormalities in physical examination, vital signs, and weight. 
 
Throughout the study, the investigat or must record all AEs on the AE CRF, regardless of the 
severity or relationship to inve stigational product.  The investig ator should treat subjects with 
AEs appropriately and observe them at suitable in tervals until the events st abilize or resolve.  
Adverse events may be discovered through observation or examination of the subject, questioning of the subject, complaint by [CONTACT_70579] t, or by [CONTACT_98284]. 
Icatibant (Firazyr®) 
Clinical Trial Protocol: HGT-FIR-[ADDRESS_108203]’s safety is not at risk. 
Additional illnesses present at the time when informed consent is given are regarded as 
concomitant illnesses and will be documented on the appropriate pages of the CRF.  Illnesses 
first occurring or detected dur ing the study, and worsening of a concomitant illness during the 
study, are to be regarded as AEs and mu st be documented as such in the CRF. 
The treated HAE attack is defined as any sympto ms occurring in treated subjects within 48 hours 
of the onset of symptoms.  Any clinically relevant worsening of the signs and symptoms of a treated attack is considered to be related to the underlying disease of HAE and will be collected separately from general reports of AEs.  Symp toms reoccurring more than 48 hours after an 
initial attack will be considered a new attack, and will also not be reported as AEs.  Attacks not 
treated with icatibant will be documented in de tail in the CRF.  They are considered to be 
pre-existing disease and will not be documented as AEs. 
Local tolerability will include symptoms at th e site of study drug admini stration (injection site) 
and will be assessed separately from general repo rts of AEs.  Local tolerability will include 
symptoms at the site of study dr ug administration (injection site) a nd will be assessed separately 
from general reports of AEs.  Injection site reactions will be documented in the "local 
tolerability" page (or form) of the CRF.  Inject ion site reactions that have been reported 
previously with icatibant included erythema, swelling, burning sensation, itching, warmth and pain and were generally, mild to moderate, transient, and resolved without sequelae.  Injection site reactions that do not meet the criteria of  a serious adverse event will not need to be 
additionally reported as AEs. 
Though AEs will be collected throughout the study, due to the acute nature of HAE attacks and 
the half-life of icatibant, it is particularly im portant to focus on AEs which have a temporal 
association with treatment.  Treatment-emerge nt AEs will be collected over a 48-hour window 
after the time of study drug administration.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious Adverse Event 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any AE occurring at any dose that results in any of the 
following outcomes: 
• Death. 
• Is life-threatening. 
• Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
• Requires prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
• A persistent or significant disability or incapacity.  
• A congenital anomaly or birth defect. 
  
Icatibant (Firazyr®) 
Clinical Trial Protocol: HGT-FIR-[ADDRESS_108204], in the view of the initial reporter, at immediate risk of death from the AE as it occurred 
(ie, it does not include an AE that, had it occurr ed in a more severe form, might have caused 
death). 
7.15.2  Classification of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events 
The severity of AEs will be assessed by [CONTACT_98285] (NCI CTCAE) Vers ion 4.0 grading scale.  If an AE is not 
described in the NCI CTCAE, the severity s hould be recorded based on the scale below (see 
Table 7-2).  The severity of a ll AEs/SAEs should be recorded on the appropriate CRF page as 
Grade 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 corresponding, respectivel y, to a severity of mild, moderate, severe, 
life-threatening, or fatal.  
Table 7-2  Adverse Event Severity   
Severity Definition 
Grade 1 (Mild) No limitation of usual activities. 
Grade 2 (Moderate) Some limitation of usual activities. 
Grade 3 (Severe) Inability to carry out usual activities. 
Grade 4 (Life-threatening) Immediate risk of death. 
Grade 5 (Fatal) Death 
 [IP_ADDRESS] Clarification between Serious and Severe 
The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event (as in mild, 
moderate, or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance (eg, severe headache).  This is not the same as “serious,” which is based on 
the outcome or action criteria usually associated  with events that pose a threat to life or 
functioning.  Seriousness (not severity) and causa lity serve as a guide for defining regulatory 
reporting obligations. 
7.15.[ADDRESS_108205] is to be determin ed by [CONTACT_98286] (See Table 7-3). Table 7-[ADDRESS_108206](s) Definition 
Not Related Unrelated to investigational product 
Possibly Related A clinical event or laboratory abnormality with a reasonable 
Icatibant (Firazyr®) 
Clinical Trial Protocol: HGT-FIR-[ADDRESS_108207](s) Definition 
time sequence to administration of investigational product, but 
which could also be explained by [CONTACT_19009]. 
Probably Related A clinical event or laboratory abnormality with a reasonable 
time sequence to administration of investigational product, unlikely to be attributable to concurrent disease or other drugs and chemicals and which follows a clinically reasonable response on de-challenge.  The association of the clinical event 
or laboratory abnormality must also have some biologic 
plausibility, at least on theoretical grounds. 
Definitely related The event follow s a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the investigational product, follows a known or suspected response pattern to the investigational product, is 
confirmed by [CONTACT_48017][INVESTIGATOR_98245] (de-challenge), and r eappears upon repeated exposure 
(re-challenge).  Note that this is  not to be construed as requiring 
re-exposure of the subject to i nvestigational product; however, 
the determination of definitely related can only be used when 
recurrence of event is observed. 
 
7.15.4  Procedures for Recording and Reporting Adverse Events 
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event Monitoring and Period of Observation 
AEs will be monitored continuously throughout the study.  For the purposes of this study, the 
period of observation extends from the time of  informed consent until the subject’s final 
evaluation of the study.  For safety purposes, the final evaluation will be defined as the follow-up 
evaluation performed approximately [ADDRESS_108208] th e sponsor to determine how the AE should be 
documented and reported. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting Serious Adverse Events 
Any SAE, regardless of relationship to investigat ional product, which occurs in a subject after 
informed consent, should be recorded by [CONTACT_98287].  The SAE must be 
completely described on the subject’s CRF, includi ng the judgment of the investigator as to the 
relationship of the SAE to the investigational product.

pregnancy reporting form should be used to re port the pregnancy.  The pregnancy will be 
followed up through delivery or final outcome. 
7.17 Abuse, Overdose, and Medication Error 
• Abuse  – Persistent or sporadic intentional inta ke of investigational medicinal product at a 
dose higher than prescribed per protocol (but below the dose defined for overdose) or when 
used for non-medical purpose (eg, altering one’s state of consciousness). 
• Misuse  – Intentional or unintentiona l use of investigational medi cinal product other than as 
directed or indicated at any dose, which is at  or below the dose defined for overdose (Note:  
this includes a situation where the test article is  not used as directed at the dose prescribed by 
[CONTACT_760]). 
• Overdose – No clinical information on overdose is available.  A dose of 3.2 mg/kg 
(approximately 8 times the therapeutic dose)  caused transient erythema, itching or 
hypotension in healthy subjects.  No therapeutic intervention was necessary. 
• Medication Error – A mistake made in prescribing, di spensing, administration and/or use of 
the investigational medicinal product. 
 
All investigational medicinal pr oduct provided to pediat ric subjects should be supervised by [CONTACT_31588](s)/legal guardian(s)/caregiver(s). 
7.[ADDRESS_108213]’s participation in the study may be di scontinued at any time at the discretion of the 
investigator.  The following may be justifiable re asons for the investigator to remove a subject 
from the study: 
• Non-compliance, including failure to a ppear at one or more study visits. 
• The subject was erroneously included in the study. 
• The subject develops an  exclusion criterion.  
• The subject suffers an intolerable adverse event. 
• The study is terminated by [CONTACT_456]. 
• The study is closed prior to the subject’s first eligible attack. 
 The subject, the subject’s parent (s), or the subject’s legal guar dian(s) acting on behalf of the 
subject is free to withdraw consent and discontinue participation in the study at any time without 
prejudice to further treatment.

Clinical Trial Protocol: HGT-FIR-[ADDRESS_108214]’s pa rent(s) or the subject’s legal gu ardian(s) acting on behalf of the 
subject, discontinues participati on in the study, or the subject is  discontinued by [CONTACT_093], 
the Subject Completion/Discontinuation Case Report Form (CRF) describing the reason for 
discontinuation must be completed.  Any AEs ex perienced up to the po int of discontinuation 
must be documented on the AE CRF.  If AEs are present when the subject withdraws from the 
study, the subject will be re-evaluated within [ADDRESS_108215] experiences a life-threatening

Following the review of safety data, the study will be either: 
• Resumed unchanged. 
• Resumed with modifications to the protocol.  
• Terminated. 
 
Subject safety will be monitored on a continuou s basis during this study until the last subject 
completes his or her last sche duled study visit/assessment.   
Additional information on safety monitoring can be found in Section 11.8, Data and Safety

validated measures for assessing the function of reproductive organs.   
Plasma samples will be assaye d for concentrations of icatib ant and its 2 major metabolites 
(M1 and M2) using a validated high-perfor mance liquid chromatography/tandem mass 
spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method with a lower limit of quantification of  1 ng/mL and a range 
from 1 to 1000 ng/mL (Analytical Report SHR10-002). 
The symptom score used in efficacy assessments in this study is an investigator-rated measure of 
symptom severity based on a standard 5-point sc oring system (0-absence of symptoms, 1-mild, 
2-moderate, 3-severe, 4-very severe)  capturing symptoms of acute attacks of HAE that have 
been identified and validated to assess efficacy in adults.  For attacks classified as abdominal or 
cutaneous, investigator-rated symptom scores  are collected for 8 symptoms:  abdominal 
tenderness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, skin pain, erythema, skin irritation, and skin swelling.   
Icatibant (Firazyr®) 
Clinical Trial Protocol: HGT-FIR-086 14 June 2011 
Shire Confidential 41 For attacks classified as laryngeal, investigat or-assessed symptom scores are collected for 
13 symptoms:  abdominal tenderness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, skin pain, erythema, skin 
irritation, skin swelling, dysphagia, voice change , breathing difficulties, stridor, and asphyxia.  In 
all pediatric subjects in the pr esent study, irrespective of age, the investigator-rated symptom 
score will provide an appropriate means to measure the severity of primary symptoms (eg, cutaneous and/or abdominal pain, cutaneous swelling, or laryngeal symptoms) of acute attacks of HAE at pretreatment and the change in symptom seve rity, if any, after treatment with icatibant.  
Though subject-reported outcomes such as the sy mptom score and visual analog scale (VAS) 
have been employed successfully as efficacy measur es in clinical studies of icatibant in adults, 
the use of these subject-reported outcomes in chil dren poses special challenges.  The Faces Pain 
Scale is a validated, self-reported measure used to assess the intensity of children's pain in a wide 
variety of clinical contexts.
9  The Faces Pain Scale-Revise d (FPS-R) was adapted from the 
original FPS in order to make it possible to sc ore pain on a widely accepted 0-to-10 metric.10  
The scales are suitable for use in assessment of the intensity of children's acute pain from age

Shire Confidential 46 10 PLANNED STATISTICAL METHODS 
10.1 General Considerations 
All statistical analyses will be performed using SAS® statistical software (SAS Institute, NC, 
[LOCATION_003]).  Data will be summarized with respect to disposition, demographic, pretreatment 
characteristics, PK variables, safety variables, and efficacy variables.  Unless stated otherwise, 
tabular summaries will be presented by [CONTACT_46897]’s stratification group at enrollment (ie, 
prepubertal group, pubertal/ postpubertal group, and th e overall subjects group.  
Summary statistics for continuous variables will include the nu mber of subjects, the mean, 
median, standard deviation, and range.  For PK parameters, the coefficient of variation and 
geometric mean also will be provided.  For cat egorical data, summaries will include counts and 
percentages.  For time to event data, the median time to event and other summary statistics will be estimated using the method of Kaplan and Meier. 
10.2 Determination of Sample Size 
Enrollment of approximately 16 prepubertal and 20 pubertal/postpubertal subjects, who are from 2 through 17 years of age and who present with a cutaneous, abdominal, or  laryngeal attack of 
acute HAE, is planned.  This sample size is empi[INVESTIGATOR_98246] a formal 
sample size calculation.  However, the inclusi on of approximately 36 subjects will provide basic 
information for safety, tolerability, PK, and efficacy. 
10.3 Analysis Populations 
The following populations will be used in the analysis: 
• The Initial Non-laryngeal Trea tment Population will consist of those subjects who were 
treated with icatibant for th eir initial attack and whose primary symptom was either 
cutaneous or abdominal.  
• The Second Non-laryngeal Treatment Populati on will consist of thos e subjects who had a 
second icatibant-treated attack for which the primary symptom was either cutaneous or abdominal, regardless of the primar y symptom for the initial attack. 
• The Third Non-laryngeal Treatment Population will consist of those subjects who had a third 
icatibant-treated attack, for which the primary symptom was either cutaneous or abdominal, 
regardless of the primary symptom for the initial attack. 
• The Laryngeal Population will consist of those subjects who were treated with icatibant for 
any attack for which the primary symptom was laryngeal.  
• The PK Population will consist of those subjects who were treated with icatibant for their initial attack and who had at least [ADDRESS_108234]-tre atment icatibant concentration recorded.   
• The Initial Treatment Population will consist of those subjects who were treated with 
icatibant for the initial attack. 
• The Additional Treatment Population will consis t of those pubertal/post-pubertal subjects 
who were treated with icatibant for more than 1 attack.   
 
Icatibant (Firazyr®) 
Clinical Trial Protocol: HGT-FIR-[ADDRESS_108235] Non- laryngeal Treatment 
Population.  The PK analyses will be based on the PK population.  Safety and tolerability 
analyses will be based on the Initial Treat ment Population and the Additional Treatment 
Population.  The Laryngeal Population will be used to explore the efficacy of icatibant for the 
treatment of laryngeal attacks.  All analyses conducted with this population will be limited to 
data corresponding to the subjec t’s first laryngeal attack. 
10.4 Demographics and Ba seline Characteristics 
Demographic data and pretreatment characteristics will be summarized for each analysis population.  
10.5 Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
A primary objective of the study is to investigate the PK of a single SC in jection of icatibant in 
pediatric subjects treated for acute  attacks of HAE.  All PK analyses will use the PK population. 
Plasma concentrations of icatibant and metabol ites (ie, M1 and M2) and actual blood sampling 
times will be listed by [CONTACT_98290].  Plasma concentrations will be summarized using descriptive statistics (number, mean and sta ndard deviation).  PK parameters for icatibant 
and metabolites will be listed by [CONTACT_98291] 
(number, mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, geometric mean, minimum, median, 
maximum).  Individual and mean plasma concentrations of icatibant and metabolites versus time 
will be displayed on linear and semi-logarithmic axes. 
10.5.1  Estimation of PK Parameters 
Noncompartmental modeling:  for subjects in whom the number of samples is sufficient to 
permit noncompartmental modeling, individual and mean PK parameters will be computed for 
icatibant and metabolites (M1 and M2) usi ng standard noncompartmental methods, where 
possible, using the WinNonLin software packag e (Pharsight Corp., Mountain View, CA).  For 
descriptive statistical tabulation of mean plasma  concentrations and graphical displays, nominal 
collection times will be used, wh ile all PK analysis and parameter calculations will use actual 
collection times.  Plasma concentrations <LOQ w ill be treated as 0 for the calculation of the 
descriptive statistics for plasma concentrations  at each sampling time.  For the pharmacokinetic 
analysis, plasma concentrations <LOQ that occu rred from pre-dose to the first concentration 
≥LOQ will be treated as 0 and those that occur thereafter will be treated as missing. 
PK parameter estimates will include, where appropr iate:  icatibant and metabolite concentrations 
at each sampling time, time to peak concentration (T
max), actual peak (C max) and minimum (C min) 
concentrations, clearance (C L/F), area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC 0-last and 
AUC 0-inf), mean residence time (MRT), volum e of distribution at steady state (V ss/F) and 
elimination half-life (t 1/2).

Clinical Trial Protocol: HGT-FIR-086 14 June 2011 
Shire Confidential 48 The distribution of continuous data  will be evaluated using parametr ic tests.  A transformation, 
such as logs, will be used where appropriate.  Multiple regression analysis, with an appropriate 
transformation on the dependent vari able, will be used to assess the contribution of potential PK 
covariates while controlling for demographic covariates (eg, subject’s age and gender) to the 
inter-subject variability of icatibant PK parameters.  The multivariable analysis will be considered the primary statistical analysis.  A p-value of 0.05 will be considered statistically significant for all analyses. 
Compartmental modeling using population methods:  nonlinear mixed effects modeling will be 
used to define individual subject profiles and if possible, parameter estimates.  The structural PK 
model will be developed and validated using PK information obtained from adult subjects and will enable delineation of the impact of age- dependent changes on icatibant disposition.  
Development of this model will allow for characterization and better prediction of the dose-concentration-e xposure relationship for icatibant in pediatric subjects.  Population PK 
modeling will be performed w ith nonlinear mixed effect modeling software (eg, NONMEM, 
Globomax LLC or WinNonMix, Pharsight Corp.).  The program will estimate the inter- and intra-individual variability of PK parameter estim ates.  Both weight-normalization and allometric 
scaling principles will be evaluated.  For selec ting preliminary meaningful covariates the general 
additive model (GAM) analysis will be used.  Va riables to be considered will include (but are 
not limited to):  age, sex, ethnicity, total and lean bodyweight (T BW, LBW), body mass index 
(BMI), and body surface area (BSA). 
Monte Carlo simulation experiments based on the model(s) developed above may be performed 
by a validated simulation software program (eg, Trial Simulator, Pharsight Corp.) to assess the 
response patterns for various dosage regimens of icatibant treatments in the pediatric population.

improvement in the average post-treatment sy mptom score with no worsening of any single 
component score.  The median time and the 95% confidence interval will be calculated using the 
Kaplan-Meier methodology. 
A tabular summary of the average investigator -reported symptom score and the change from 
baseline in the average investigator-reported symptom score will be presented by [CONTACT_98296].  An a lternative anal ysis of time to onset of 
symptom relief will focus on the time to minimal symptoms.  In this case, symptom relief is defined as the earliest time post-treatment when all symptoms are either absent or mild.  
For individual investigator-reported symptom sc ores, a shift table from baseline will be 
presented for each post-treatment time point.  The analysis will be repeated to assess shift in the 
individual symptom scores from the 2 hour time-point.  Also, for individual symptoms that are moderate or worse at pretreatment, the median a nd 95% confidence interval will be presented for 
the time to the symptom being mild or absent.  
A subset of subjects, 4 years of age or older, will assess pain using the Faces Pain Scale-Revised 
(FPS-R).  Time to onset of symp tom relief will be computed in a manner similar to that for the 
average investigator-reported symptom scores.

10.[ADDRESS_108240] (DSMB) will be set up to review the safety, tolerability, PK and efficacy data on an ongoing basis.  The goal of the DSMB will be to assess the risk/benefit of icatibant treatment in this pediatric population.  An analysis of the data for DSMB review is 
planned after the first [ADDRESS_108241] s in the pubertal/ postpubertal gr oup have been treated.  Because

11.[ADDRESS_108249] (DSMB).  The DSMB will provide an 
ongoing, independent review and assessment of the sa fety data to protect th e interests and safety 
of subjects participating in th e study.  The DSMB will adhere to a prospectively determined 
charter which will be proposed by [CONTACT_98307].  The charter will define the membership of the DSMB, the responsi bilities of the DSMB and Shire HGT, describe 
the conduct of meetings, and define  the data to be reviewed.   
Enrollment of pediatric subjects in the proposed st udy will be stratified into  2 groups (2 years of 
age to the older prepubertal ch ildren, and pubertal/postpubertal children to those 17 years of 
age).  It is planned that subjects in both groups  will receive an icatibant dose (0.4 mg/kg to a 
maximum dose of 30 mg) selected to target an exposure comparable to th at observed in adults 
treated with icatibant.  Initially, enrollment and dosing of  pubertal/postpubertal subjects will 
precede that of prepubertal subjects.  After the first 4 subjects in the pubertal/postpubertal group 
have been treated, icatibant concentration measurem ents and PK analysis, safety, and tolerability 
data will be reviewed and assessed by [CONTACT_4318] .  This review must be completed prior to 
initiating enrollment of subjects in the prepubertal group.  As the outcome of its review, the 
DSMB may make a recommendation to continue en rolling subjects in th e pubertal/postpubertal 
group, to initiate dosing of  subjects in the prepubertal group, or to administer a different dose, or 
to terminate the study.  
11.9 Protocol Violations/Deviations 
The investigator will conduct the study in compliance with the protocol.  The protocol will not be initiated until the IRB/IEC and the appropr iate regulatory authorities have given 
approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649].  Modifications to the prot ocol will not be made without agreement 
of the sponsor.  Changes to the protocol will require written IRB/IEC approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_67415], except when the modifi cation is needed to eliminate an immediate 
hazard(s) to subjects.  The IRB/IEC may provide , if applicable regulatory authorities permit, 
expedited review and approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_98247](s) in ongoing studies that 
have the approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_1100]/ IEC.  The sponsor will submit all protocol 
modifications to the regulatory authoritie s in accordance with the governing regulations. 
A record of subjects screened, but  not entered into the study, is al so to be maintained.  For any 
subject who does not meet the inclusion or ex clusion criteria a protocol exemption may be 
requested by [CONTACT_093].  This exempti on may be approved by [CONTACT_98308]. 
When immediate deviation from the protocol is required to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to 
subjects, the investigator will contact [CONTACT_12409], if circumstances permit, to 
discuss the planned course of action.

initiation. 
11.[ADDRESS_108251] may be made at any time.  Conditions that may 
warrant termination of the study or s ite include, but are not limited to: 
• The discovery of an unexpected, significant, or  unacceptable risk to the subjects enrolled in 
the study. 
• Failure of the investigator to comply with pertinent global regulations. 
• Submission of knowingly false information from  the study site to the sponsor or other 
pertinent regulatory authorities. 
• Insufficient adherence by [CONTACT_98311]. 
 
11.11  Access to Source Documentation 
Regulatory authorities, the IRB/IEC, or the spons or may request access to all source documents, 
CRFs, and other study documentation for on-site a udit or inspection.  Di rect access to these 
documents must be guaranteed by [CONTACT_1188], who must provide support at all times for 
these activities.  Monitoring and auditing proced ures that comply with current GCP guidelines 
will be followed.  On-site review of the CRFs for completeness and clarity, cross-checking with source documents, and clarification of ad ministrative matters may be performed.

Submitter's commentary: 
The Faces Pain Scale - Revised (FPS-R) was adapted from th e 
Faces Pain Scale (Bieri et al, 1990) in order to make it possibl e 
to score on the widely accepted 0-to-10 metric. It shows a clos e 
linear relationship with visual analog pain scales across the ag e 
range 4 through 16 years. It is easy to administer and require s 
no equipment except for the photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_98248]. The absence of 
smiles and tears in this faces scale may be advantageous. Th e 
FPS-R is recommended for use with younger children in parallel with numerical self-rating scales (0-to-10) for older children an d 
behavioural observation scales for those unable to provide self -
report.

Faces Pain Scale – Revised  (FPS-R)  From Pediatric Pain Sourcebook , www.painsourcebook.ca  
Version: 7 Aug 2007  CL von Baeyer 
In the following instructions, say "hurt" or "pain," whichever seem s right for a particular child.  
"These faces show how much so mething can hurt. This face  [point to left-most face]  shows no pain. The faces show 
more and more pain [point to each from left 
to right]  up to this one [point to right-most face]  – it shows very much pain. 
Point to the face that shows how much you hurt  [right now] ." 
Score the chosen face 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10, counting left to right, so '0' = 'no pain' and '10' = 'very much pain.'  Do not use  words 
like 'happy' and 
'sad'. This scale is intended to measure how children feel inside, not how their face looks.

"Ces visages montrent combien on peut avoir mal. Ce visage (montrer celui de gauche)  montre quelqu’un qui n’a pas 
mal du tout. Ces visages (les montrer un à un de gauche à droite)  montrent quelqu’un qui a de plus en plus mal, jusqu’à 
celui-ci (montrer celui de droite) , qui montre quelqu’un qui a tr ès très mal. Montre-moi le visage qui montre combien tu 
as mal en ce moment."  
Les scores sont de gauche à droite : 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10. 0 correspond donc à “pas mal du tout” et 10 correspond à “très très mal ”.  
Exprimez c
lairement les 
limites extrêmes : “pas mal du tout” et “très très mal”. N’utilisez pas le s mots “triste” ou “heureux”.  
Précisez bien qu’il s’agit de la sensation intérieure, pas de l’aspect affiché de leur visage.

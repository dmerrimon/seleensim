Appendix 1  Injection Technique ………………………………………………….......38  
Appendix 2:    Reference s…………… ….........................................................................[ADDRESS_1054063] in this population is increasing; it currently affects 4.2 million 
people, and it is projected that this figure will rise to 6 million people by [CONTACT_2892] 2 020. 
Vision -threatening diabetic retinopathy (VTDR) is estimated to affect 700,000 
individuals in the US. By 2020, this is expected to increase to 1.34 million people.  
Diabetic ma cular edema (DME) is the most common cause of vision loss from diabetic 
retinopathy.  It is characterized by [CONTACT_768492].  Clinically, 
microaneurys ms and exudates are often seen in association with macular edema.  Foveal -
involving cystic changes and macular edema can have significant impact on visual loss.  
Extent of perfusion and ischemia also is important for visual prognosis .   
Multiple factors pl ay a role in the evolution of diabetic macular edema.  Vascular 
endothelial growth factor has been shown to be significantly elevated in diabetic 
retinopathy and may play an important role in the evolution and pathogenesis of DME.   
Increasing VEGF levels are also seen in the setting of progressive ischemia, such as 
proliferative diabetic retinopathy when extensive peripheral nonperfusion may be present 
(Wessel et al, 2012). Additionally significant peripheral vascular perfusion abnormalities 
are often seen  in other retinal vascular diseases  (Singer et al, 2014).  Reducing the active 
levels of VEGF may have significant positive consequences for outcomes related to 
DME. VEGF has 2 properties that explain its important roles in normal fetal development 
and in biology: VEGF is a powerful mitogen  for endothelial cells (Ferrara et al., 1991), 
thus promoting formation of new vessels that are required for normal and pathological 
tissue growth (Ferrara, 2000; Ferrara and Davis -Smyth, 1997).  
VEGF  is a homodimeric protein with a molecular weight of  34 to 42 kDa 
(Thickett, 1999). VEGF binds to and activates 2 high affinity receptors,  Flt-1 (VEGFR1) 
and Flk -1 (VEGFR2), which are predominantly located on the vascular  endothelium.   
IAI is a recombinantly produced fusion protein consisting of portions of the  
human VEGF receptor extracellular domains fused to the Fc domain of human IgG1 
(Figure 1). IAI is comprised of portions of the extracellular domains of 2 different VEGF 
receptors. It contains sequences encoding Ig domain 2 from VEGFR1 fused to Ig domain 
3 from VEGFR2, which in turn is fused to the hinge region of the human IgG1 Fc 
domain. IAI is a dimeric glycoprotein with a protein molecular weight of 97 kDa, and 
contains ~15% glycosylation to give a total molecular weight of [ADDRESS_1054064] 7 Ig domains in the  
extracellular portion and a tyrosine kinase domain intracellularly. IAI contains  
the VEGFR1 Ig2 domain fused to the VEGFR2 Ig3 domain, which is in turn fused to  the 
IgG1 Fc.  
 
IAI has several potential advantages over other VEGF blockers: it has a much  
higher affinity (~ 0.5 pM dissociation constant for VEGF 165 and VEGF 121) than a  
humanized monoclonal antibody. IAI also binds the related factors Placental  
Growth Factor 1 and 2 (PLGF1 and PLGF2), which may be advantageou s in certain 
disease situations, including retinal neovascularization (Rakic et al 2003).  
 
 
1.2 Rationale  
1.2.1 Rationale for Study Design  
Multiple phase III  studies (e.g., RISE, RIDE, VISTA, VIVID, ), have evaluated 
intravitreal anti-VEGF agents for the management of DME.  Results from these studies 
demonstrated clinical efficacy and significant improvements in visual acuity and macular 
thickness.  There are three currently utilized anti -VEGF agents for DME us ed: 
bevacizumab (Avastin, Genentech/[COMPANY_002]), ranibizumab (Lucentis,  Genentech/[COMPANY_002]), 
and aflibercept (Eylea, Regeneron/Bayer).   
A head to head comparison of these agents was recently completed.  Protocol T 
was a multicenter, randomized clinical trial com paring the efficacy and safety of aflibercept 2.[ADDRESS_1054065] 1 eye with center -involved DME and no anti -vascular endothelial growth factor 
(anti-VEGF) treatme nt within 12 months prior to enrollment (N=660). The mean duration of 
diabetes was 17 years; the mean visual acuity (VA) at baseline was approximately 20/50 (Table 
1). A little more than a third of patients had prior focal/grid laser photocoagulation and 1 1% to 
14% had prior anti -VEGF therapy for DME.  
Treatment was every 4 weeks while the eye was improving or worsening.  Treatment was 
deferred when VA was 20/20 or better, with central subfield thickness (CST) below the eligibility 
threshold (250  µm to 320  µm) or the eye was stable for 2 injections (Figure 1). The mean 
improvement in VA letter score was greater with aflibercept than with bevacizumab (13.3 vs. 9.7; 
P<.001) or ranibizumab (13.3 vs. 11.2; P=.03). The relative effect varied according to initial VA, 

 
 May 20, 2016, Version 6   Page 13 
  with the mean improvement from baseline increasing with worse initial VA letter score (<69; 
20/50 or worse at baseline). In this subpopulation (49% of cohort), mean improvement was +18.9 
for aflibercept, +11.8 for bevacizumab, and +14.2 for ranibizumab . The median number of 
injections (maximum possible 13) was [ADDRESS_1054066] once between 24 and 48 weeks, was performed in 
36% of aflibercept -treated eyes, 56% of bevacizumab -treated eyes, and 46% of ranibizumab -
treated eyes ( P<.001 for overall comparison). Retinal thickening was decreased to <250 µm in 
66% of aflibercept -treated eyes, 36% of bevacizumab -treated eyes, and 58% of ranibizumab -
treated eyes. Bevacizumab was statisti cally significantly less effective for improving CST 
outcomes than either aflibercept or ranibizumab.  
 
While all treatments demonstrated significant treatment benefit, there were clearly 
differences in the anti -VEGF agent and the anatomical and vision res ponse in patients 
especially in those with vision 20/[ADDRESS_1054067] anti -VEGF therapy for a minimum of 12 months 
prior to entry.  Thus, there is a gap in understanding on what the outcomes will be when 
patients are transitioned to IAI from other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].    
 
In addition, the major ity of retina specialists also do not treat on a fixed dosing pattern as 
seen in registration trials  and instead employ a pro re nata (PRN) treatment regimen 
based on OCT and clinical exam. Does the movement from PRN treatments to a fixed 
dosing scheme of every 2 months achieve the same visual and anatomical  outcomes?   
 
Below is the schema for retreatment in Prot ocol T.  Because of the complexity of the 
treatment algorithm, the treatment frequency from protocol T would not likely be adopted 
to retina practi ces. Therefore a regimen with a fixed dosing interval may improve clinical 
efficiency and decrease clinical visits for patients with DME.   
 
Preliminary studies have suggested that there is a significant amount of retinal 
vascular changes (e.g., increased permeability , ischemia) in patients with DME  ((Wessel 
et al, 2012 ). These global assessments of OCT angiographic features, including leakage 
and ischemia, may allow for a better characterization of the disease burden and allow for 
the development of imagin g biomarkers that have implications for therapeutic response 
or resistance. This study will prospectively assess the alterations in OCT angiographic 
parameters to provide insights into the retinal vascular changes that occur during 
treatment with IAI and t o examine the relationship between these features and treatment 
response.

4.4 Concomitant Medications and Procedures  
Study Eye:  
Subjects may not receive any medications (approved or investigational) for their DME in 
the study ey e other than the assigned study treatment ( intravitreal IAI injection as 
specified in this protocol, until they have completed the end of study (12 months) or ET 
visit assessments. This includes medications administered locally ( e.g., IVT, topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], 
juxtascleral or periorbital routes), as well as those administered systemically, with the 
intent of treating the study and/or fellow eye. No focal/grid laser photocoagulation can be 
performed  during the study . Panretinal laser photocoagulat ion can be performed for the 
presence of proliferative disease with vitreous hemorrhage or other high risk 
characteristics (e.g., neovascularization of the disc)  during the course of the study .

May 20, 2016, Version 6    Page 26 
  5.2.5 Unscheduled Visits  
All attempts should be made to keep subjects on the study schedule.  Unscheduled visits 
may be necessary to repeat testing following AEs, or for any other reason, as warranted.  
5.3 Study Procedures  
5.3.1 Procedures Performed only at the Screening/Baseline Visit  
No specific procedures  other than above  will be performed for the sole purpose of 
determining study eligibility or characterizing the baseline population.  
5.3.2 Efficacy Procedure s 
Vision: Visual Acuity  Visual function of the study eye and the fellow eye will be 
assessed using the E-ETDRS protocol (The Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study 
Group, 1985). Visual Acuity examiners must be certified to ensure consistent 
measurement of BCVA.   
 
Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT): Retinal characteristics will be 
evaluate d using SDOCT on the study eye. At the Screen Visit (Visit 1) images will be 
captured and archived . The scanning protocol will consist of fast macular thickness maps 
as well as high definition 6.[ADDRESS_1054089]  (Cirrus OCT, Humphrey Zeiss Inc., San 
Leandro, CA, software version 5.0).  OCT images will read by  a trained reader and also 
assess ed with a computerized segmentation analysis tool . 
 
Spectral domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) is noninvasive noncontact [CONTACT_768501].  
OCT allows for high -resolution visualization of eye structures including the retina, 
choroid, and optic nerve.  OCT technology uses light in a similar method to ultrasound.     
 
OCT angiography (OCT -A) utilizes OCT technology and special software to reconstruct 
the active vascular network in the area of interest.  This is a major breakthro ugh in 
technology because for the first time a clinician has the ability to visualize the perfused 
vascular network in a noninvasive and minimal risk way.   
 
OCT -A software is now available on various FDA -cleared OCT devices.  The software is 
currently not  FDA -approved as the clinical endpoints have not been defined and 
normative validation has not been completed. (see rationale for exemption for IDE in 
research procedures below).  Utilizing OCT -A software does not impact the patient.  
Following obtaining t he OCT image with the FDA -approved system, the OCT -A 
software is then used to process sequential OCT scans to reconstruct the vascular 
network.   Although this software is not approved for use in the [LOCATION_002], it presents 
minimal risk to the patient a nd the procedure for imaging is exactly the same as that of 
spectral -domain OCT.  
 
The data obtained from OCT -A may provide important information on disease activity.  
 
May 20, 2016, Version 6    Page 27 
   
Fundus Evaluation, Fundus Photography , and Fluorescein Angiography (FA):  
The anatomical state of the retinal vasculature of the study eye will be evaluated by  
[CONTACT_112874]. Ultra -widefield fundus photography and fluorescein 
angiography will be performed at the baseline visit, month 6, and at the month [ADDRESS_1054090]  angiography wi ll be performed at the baseline visit, month 6, and at the month 12 
visit.   Angiographic analysis will be performed by a trained reader and a computerized 
analysis tool.  
 
Intraocular Pressure:  
Intraocular pressure (IOP) of the study eye will be measured us ing applanation tonometry  
or Tonopen. The same method of IOP measurement must be used in each subject  
throughout the study.  
5.3.3 Safety Procedures  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Event Information Collection  
The investigator (or designee) will record all AEs that occur during the study  following 
the baseline visit.  Information on follow -up for AEs is provided in section 6.2.[ADDRESS_1054091] a causal relationship with the study drug.  Therefore, an AE is any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or 
disease which is temporally associated with the use of a study drug, whether or not 
considered related to the study drug.   
An AE also includes any worsening (i.e. any clinically significant change in frequency 
and/or intensity) of a pre -existing condit ion that is temporally associated with the use of 
the study drug.  
6.1.[ADDRESS_1054092] medical occurrence that at any dose:  
 Results in death  – includes all deaths, even those that appear to be completely 
unrelated to study drug (e.g.  a car accident in which a patient  is a passenger).  
 
May 20, 2016, Version 6    Page 28 
   Is life-threatening  – in the view of the investigator, the patient  is at immediate 
risk of death at the time of the event.  This does not include an AE that had it 
occurred in a more severe form, might ha ve caused death.  
 Requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_869].  
In-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_24927] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_768478] 24 hours.  Prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_308839] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_24929], or is 
prolonged due to the development of a new AE as determined by [CONTACT_25043].  
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  (substantial disruption of 
one’s ability to conduct normal life functions).  
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect . 
 Is an important medical event – Important medical events may not be 
immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but ma y 
jeopardize the patient  or may require intervention to prevent 1 of the other serious 
outcomes listed above (e.g., intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home 
for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1916]; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse).  Any 
malignancy (other than basal cell skin cancers) would be considered a medically 
important event.  
6.2 Recording and Reporting Adverse Events  
All AE s and SAEs will be recorded in the patient ’s sour ce documents.  Laboratory values  
or vital signs will be recorded as AE s only if they are medically relevant.  
 
All SAEs, regardless of assessment of causal relationship to study drug will be reported 
to Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
 
The investigator will promptly report to the IRB all unanticipated problems involving 
risks to subjects .  This includes death from any cause and all SAEs related to the use of 
the study drug.  All SAEs will be reported to the IRB, regardless of assessed ca usality.  
 
May 20, 2016, Version 6    Page 29 
  6.2.1 Deaths  
Any AE that results in death is considered a SAE.  Deaths that occur from the time the 
patient  signs the informed consent form (“ICF”) until 30 days after dosing will be 
reported to the appropriate IRB and to Regeneron Pharmacovigilance and  Risk 
Management (or designee) within 24 hours of learning of the death.   
 
Any available autopsy reports and relevant medical reports will be sent to Regeneron 
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. as soon as possible.

of any SAE until the event is considered chronic and/or stable.  
 
6.3 Evaluation of Severity and Causality  
6.3.1 Evaluation of Severity  
The severity of an AE will be graded by [CONTACT_55296] a 3 –point scale (mild, 
moderate, or severe) and reported in detail as indicated on the CRF  and/or SAE form, as 
appropriate.  
 Mild:   Does not interfere in a significant manner with the patient ’s normal 
functioning level.  It may be an annoyance.  Prescription drugs are not ordinar ily 
needed for relief of symptoms, but may be given because of personality of the 
patient . 
 Moderate:   Produces some impairment of functioning but is not hazardous to 
health.  It is uncomfortable or an embarrassment.  Treatment for symptom may be 
needed.  
 
May 20, 2016, Version 6    Page 31 
   Severe:   Produces significant impairment of functioning or incapacitation and is a 
definite hazard to the patient ’s health.  Treatment for symptom may be given 
and/or patient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057].  
6.3.2 Evaluation of Causality  
The relationship to treatment will be determi ned by [CONTACT_768503]/or SAE form, as appropriate.  The following terms will be used:  
Not Related:   likely or clearly due to causes other than the study drug.  
Related:   possibly, probably, or definitely related to the study dr ug.

injection site.  
d. A sterile speculum may be used.  
e. Mark the injection site location with an empty Tb syringe.  
f. Apply additional drop of povidone -iodine to site of injection.  
 
 Study Drug (VEGF Trap -Eye) Administration:  
a. Insert needle at marked injection point.  
b. Gently inject study drug.  
c. As the needle is withdrawn, a sterile cotton tip applicator may be rolled over 
the entry site to minimize the risk of drug reflux.  
 
 Post-Injection Procedures  
Confirm that the patient has at least counting fingers vision .  See guidelines below for 
additional post -injection management procedures.   
 
Guidelines for Pre and Post -injection Management  
 Use of Topi[INVESTIGATOR_768483] -injection antibiotics will be used.  
 
 
May 20, 2016, Version 6    Page 39 
   If vision is less than Counting Fingers:  
Visualize the optic nerve to verify reperfusion of the central retinal artery in the 
immediate post -injection period.  
 
Check the IOP while maintaining a clean fi eld.  Monitor the IOP closely until it is 
below 30  mm Hg. If a Tono -pen™ is used to check pressure, a clean Tono -pen™ 
condom should be placed on the tip before taking each measurement. If Goldmann 
applanation tonometry is used, the applanator tip should be  swabbed with alcohol and 
let to dry before using it to measure IOP.  IOP may be lowered by [CONTACT_768511], if required.   Treatment should be initiated whenever IOP is 
increased to the extent that the central retinal artery remains  closed or the patient 
remains less than count fingers for more than 1 to 2 minutes with an IOP > 35 mm 
Hg.   
 
 Discharge  
No special precautions are required before discharge of a patient who has had an 
uneventful recovery from intravitreal  injection, but patients and/or caregivers should 
be educated to avoid rubbing the eye and to recognize the signs and symptoms of 
endophthalmitis, retinal detachment, or intraocular hemorrhage; these are eye pain or 
increased discomfort, increased redness of the eye (compared to immediately after 
injection), blurred or decreased vision, and increased ocular sensitivity to light.

[IP_ADDRESS] Radio -ligand Binding Assay 
Radio-ligand binding assays were performed on 168 molecular targets, including 
receptors, ion channels and transporters, to discover the possible functional agonism 
and/or antag onism of PDC -1421 at concentration of 100 μg/ml. Table 3 show ed the 
result in this study, indicating that PDC -1421 specifically inhibited norepi[INVESTIGATOR_542675]. Other molecules , such as histamine receptor or cholinergic receptor , were 
not significantl y influenced . The results suggested that PDC -1421 shall not induce  
side effects  such as  hypersomnia or dry month. Subsequent studies  applying  different 
concentration showed that the inhibition of norepi[INVESTIGATOR_584876] -1421 
is dose -dependent , within 3 to 100  μg/ml . Norepi[INVESTIGATOR_584877] s, such as imipramine, venlafaxine and reboxetine2.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Tetrabenazine  (TBZ) -induced Hypothermia Model 
According to above assays, PDC -1421 is a selective norepi[INVESTIGATOR_26331]. 
A previous study has shown that the elevated concentration of norepi[INVESTIGATOR_584882] (NRI) resulted in elevation of body 
temperature in reserpi[INVESTIGATOR_050] -induc ed hypothermia animal model4. Reversed temperature 
in hypothermia model is an index to quanti fy the effect of NRI . Several studies have 
been conducted using this model to evaluate the antidepress ant effect s of 
investigational drug s5, 6and support the usefu lness of the TBZ Hypothermia model.  
 
PDC -[ADDRESS_768867] on depression. Vehicle, PDC -1421 and imipramine (positive control) were 
orally administrated to individual groups of experimental mic e one hour before TBZ 
treatment and body temperatures were recorded at appropriate time point. The results 
were summarized in Table 5.

[IP_ADDRESS] Single Dose Acute Toxicity Study in Rats 
Acute toxicity of test drug may predict effect of over dose. Four doses of PDC -1421 
at 0, 1250, 2500 and 5000 mg/kg p.o. were given to different groups of  rats. General 
demeanor, clinical signs, mortality, body weight and gross necropsy findings were 
evaluated and recorded. There has been no treatment -related pharmacological effect

[IP_ADDRESS]  28-day Repeated Dose Subacute Toxicity Study in Rats 
The duration of repeated dose toxicity study will be extrapolated to human therapeutic 
duration. Thus, toxic effects rela ted to test drug dose in long term administration and 
determination of NOAEL are very important in further clinical study. Four group s of 
rats were administered with 0, 750, 1500 and 3000 mg/kg  /once daily p.o.  for 28 days 
respectively. Moribundity/mortali ty, clinical signs, body weight, food consumption, 
ophthalmology, clinical pathology (including urinalysis, hematology and serum 
chemistry), gross necropsy, organ weight and histopathology, were evaluated  on those 
experimental rats. No death nor severe sid e effects had been  observed . However,  
some effects were  considered treatment -related as shown in Table 8:

[IP_ADDRESS] 28 -day Repeated Dose Subacute Toxicity Study  in Dogs 
In order to determine NOAEL in dogs, PDC -1421 was repeatedly administered to 4 
groups of dogs at dose levels of 0, 300, 1000, 3000 mg/kg once daily for 28 days. Soft 
feces were found in male dogs at 3000 mg/kg. There are several differences of 
physical value , lower mean corpuscular volume and monocytes in males and lower 
cholesterol and triglyceride in females, between test groups and control group, but these 
effects are not treatment -related or dose -dependent  and within DCB (Development 
Center for  Biotechnology) historical data range . Therefore, NOAEL for PDC -1421 in 
dogs is set at 3000 mg/kg.

[IP_ADDRESS] 13 -week Repeated Dose Subchronic Toxicity Study in Rats  
To evaluate the subchronic toxicity of PDC -1421, four groups of rats were 
administered with 0 , 750, 1500 and 2500 mg/kg/once daily p.o. for 13 weeks (90 
days) . There are no treatment -related mortality, clinical signs of toxicity and 
ophthalmologic  abnormality in the study. And n o significant toxicity evidences in 
mean body weights, mean body  weigh t gains and food consumption in all treatment 
groups were noted.   
 
In clinical pathology, no toxicity evidence s were noted for all parameters (hematology,  
serum chemistry and urinalysis) , no treatment -related gross abnormality was found  at 
necropsy , and no  significant  toxicity evidences in organ weights evaluation.  And t he 
histopathological findings showed that no treatment -related change s in vehicl e control 
and PDC -1421 treated groups.   
 
It was estimated that the NOAEL of PDC -1421  of the 13 -week repeated d ose toxicity  
study  is 2500 mg/kg/day for both males and females.  
 
1.2.4. [ADDRESS_768872], three dose s of PDC -1421 
at 500, 1000, 2000 mg/kg  p.o. were administered to three different groups of BALB/c 
mice and the ability of PDC -1421 to induce micronucleated reticulocytes in mouse 
peripheral blood was measured. The results of this study indicated that PDC -1421 
posed-negative response  to clastoge nic micronucleated reticulocytes in mice. In 
chromosome aberration assay, clastogenic activity was evaluated in Chinese hamster 
ovary (CHO) cells after adding the different concentration of PDC -1421. Based on the 
results of this study, chromosomes in CHO c ells are not affected by [CONTACT_584904] -1421. In 
conclusion, PDC -1421 does not pose any risk of genotoxicity.  
 
1.3 Results of Phase I Clinical Trial Study of PDC -1421

PDC -1421 was observed to be associated with some adverse effects in serum 
electrolytes and GI function, but none were clinically significant. Therefore, potential 
risks of PD C-1421 are fluctuated electrolyte level and gastrointestinal discomfort. We 
monitored these in the Phase I study  and there was no deviation of electrolyte level 
and no significant gastrointestinal discomfort during monitoring in the clinical trial.  
However , there were non-clinically significant mild lower diastolic blood pressure 
and lower heart rate in dog telemetry study and it has been only with the 2500 mg/kg, 
which is around the NOAEL for dogs.  The cardiovascular systems  will be monitored 
in the clinic al study.

1.4.3 Risk Benefit Ratio 
Potential risks in nonclinical results outlined above are minor and easy to monitor. 
Even though there were adverse events in phase I trial, they were no consistent 
findings in the direction of changes of potential risks in nonclinical studies. Therefore, 
the subsequent trial could be benefited from the information obtained from this study.   
 
1.5 Dosage Regimen  
Based on the FDA ’s guidance documents, NOAEL s from toxicity studies were used to 
estimate the  starting dos e in our study. Table 10 summarizes the MRSD  for 60 kg 
human/day calculated  from the NOAEL of 28 day repeating dose studies in rats and in 
dogs  using safety margin at 75-fold.

Cohort A enrolled 9 subjects. Seven subjects received PDC -1421 Capsule and two 
received placebo. There wa s only one of placebo subjects who met a DLT due to the 
glucose value at 24 hours after drug administration. We continued the study to the 
next higher dosage, cohort B.  
Cohort B (three capsules; 1140  mg):  
Cohort B enrolled 8 subjects. Six subjects receive d PDC -1421 Capsule and two 
received placebo. There was only one of placebo subjects who met a DLT due to the 
glucose value at 4 hours after drug administration. We continued the study to the next 
higher dosage, cohort C.  
Cohort C (six capsules; 2280  mg):  
Cohort C enrolled 4 subjects. Three subjects received PDC -1421 Capsule and one 
received placebo. There was no DLT in this cohort. We continued the study to the next 
higher dosage, cohort D.  
Cohort D (ten capsules; 3800  mg):  
Cohort D enrolled 9 subjects. Sev en received PDC -1421 Capsule and two received 
placebo. There is no DLT in the final cohort.  
Based on the results, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is ≧3800  mg of PDC -1421 
Capsule so that the safe and well -tolerated for PDC1 -421 Capsule is from 380  mg to 
3800 mg. According to studies in mouse model system to evaluate efficacious dose,  
TBZ -induced hypothermia assay,  PDC -1421 was indicated to be efficient at 100  
mg/kg and 300  mg/kg doses which are equivalent to about 480  mg and 1400  mg in 
human subjects. We c hoose 1140  mg (3 capsules) , between the efficient dosage,  and 
2280  mg (6 capsules) , above the efficient dosage,  which is based on the mice study  as

comparison between group of 1 capsule  TID, 2 capsules TID of PDC -1421 Capsule and 
placebo  will be conducted in final report of this study to ev aluate which group(s) of 
PDC -1421 Capsule are efficient. The rating scales are as follows:  
 
˙ MADRS ( Montgomery - Å sberg  Depression Rating Scale)  
The MADRS is a [ADDRESS_768906] including 1) depression [apparent]; 2) 
depression [reported]; 3) loss of interes t; 4) suicidal ideation; 5) tension; 6) reduced 
appetite; 7) insomnia; 8) difficulty in activities; 9) concentration; and 10) pessimism. 
Each Item is rated on a scale of 0 -6, with anchors at 2 -point intervals; higher scores 
indicating more severity (i.e., ranging from 0 [no sadness] to 6 [extremely 
despondent]). Percentage of partial responders (defined as a participant with a 
25-50%decrease from baseline in total score) and responders (defined as a participant 
with ≧50%decrease from baseline in total scor e.). The following are as an 
interpretation of scores:  
Recovere d, 7 
Mild , 15 
Moderate , 25 
Severe , 31 
Very severe, 44  
 
˙ CGI ( Clinical Global Impression)  
The CGI actually comprises two companion one -item measures evaluating the 
following: (a) CGI -Severity (CGI -S) which rates illness severity of psychopathology 
from 1 to 7 and (b) CGI -Improvement (CGI -I) which rates change from the 
initiation (baseline) of treatment.  
 
˙ HAM -D-17 (Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression)  
This is one of the earliest scales to be developed for depression, and is a clinician 
rated scale aimed at as sessing depression severity among patients for treatment. 
There are four specific HAM -D symptom groups: psychomotor retardation, anxiety, 
cognitive disturbance and insomnia. The depression score ranges from 0 to 52. The 
following are as an interpretation o f scores:

0-7: Normal  
8-16: Mild  
17-23: Moderate  
≧24: Severe  
 
˙ HAM -A (Hamilton Rating Scale for anxiety)  
HAM -A is a series of questions related to symptoms of anxiety. It rates the individual 
on a five -point scale (0~4) for each of the 14 items. Seven of the items specifically 
address psychic anxiety and the remaining seven items address somatic anxiety. The 
anxiety score ranges from 0 to 56, lower scores are better.  The following are as an 
interpretation of scores:  
0-13: Normal  
14-17: Mild  
18-24: Moderate  
≧25: Severe  
 
˙ DSSS (Depression and Somatic Symptoms  Scale)  
The scale includes a simultaneous measure of depression and somatic symptoms that 
two issues frequently co -occur. Though many preexisting questionnaires for 
depression contain items relating to somatic complaints, the DSSS is specifically 
concerned  with the relationsh ip between the two. Consisting of 22 items, the DSSS 
includes 12 depression -related items and 10 somatic items. Evaluation of the severity 
of the symptoms are the following:  
Absent: no symptoms  
Mild: symptoms caused slight discomfort o r disturbance  
Moderate: symptoms caused significant discomfort or disturbance  
Severe: symptoms caused very significant discomfort or disturbance

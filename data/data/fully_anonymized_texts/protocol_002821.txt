sessio ns of smoking cessation behavioral counseling. Outcomes are smoking abstinence and weight change.  
 
2. INTRODUCTION  
 
2.1. Background  
Tobacco use and obesity are the two leading causes of preventable deaths (1). A growing literature indicates that 
common neurobiological substrates mediate drug addiction and obesity (2, 3). Therefore, it is not surprising that 
during smoking abstinence, h ighly palatable food may serve as a substitute reinforcer ultimately leading to 
increased body weight gain. Importantly, post -cessation weight gain (PCWG) can deter a quit attempt, precipi[INVESTIGATOR_249805], and contribute to health issues related to exc ess body weight (4 -8). The majority of weight gain 
occurs within 3 -6 months of quitting smoking (9, 10) and many individuals maintain this increased weight [ADDRESS_874806] -cessation (11 -13). Although there is substantial variability in the amount of wei ght gained, individuals 
who successfully quit smoking gain an average of 4.2 kg, with estimates ranging from 2.5 kg to 8.6 kg, at 6 -month 
follow -up (9, 10, 14, 15). Weight gain after smoking cessation contributes to increased risk of obesity (16), type II 
diabetes mellitus (17) and hypertension (18), as well as reducing the improvement in lung function conferred by 
[CONTACT_249862] (19). Moreover, overweight or obese smokers comprise 70% of treatment -seeking smokers, 
gain the most weight, and are the least  accepting of PCWG (20 -23). Thus, post -cessation weight gain is a significant 
clinical problem (16, 24, 25). Unfortunately, current pharmacological interventions to reduce post -cessation 
weight gain are not very effective (6).  
 
While weight gain is often c ited as a primary reason for smoking relapse (16, 25), there is a significant gap in our 
understanding of the biobehavioral mechanisms linking smoking cessation and overeating. Recent evidence 
indicates that glucagon -like peptide -1 (GLP -1) regulates the re warding effects of nicotine (26). These effects are 
mediated, in part, by [CONTACT_651799], a key brain region known to regulate 
the reinforcing effects of both drugs of abuse and palatable foods (26 -28). Indeed, activati on of  GLP-1 receptors 
in the VTA, a brain region that sends dopaminergic projections to the nucleus accumbens, reduces both drug 
intake and consumption of palatable food (29, 30). Based on the ability of GLP -[ADDRESS_874807] recently developed a novel animal model of nicotine withdrawal -induced hyperphagia and bo dy weight 
gain in order to gain an improved understanding of the molecular and behavioral mechanisms underlying 
increased food intake and body weight gain during nicotine withdrawal. Our pi[INVESTIGATOR_651771] -induced hyperphagia and body 
weight gain following voluntary nicotine self -administration. This withdrawal phenotype was evident only in rats 
given ad libitum access to a highly palatable diet during withdrawal  as parallel studies using a normal chow diet 
did not produce hyperphagia or changes in body weight during nicotine withdrawal (data not shown). Collectively, 
these results are consistent with human laboratory studies indicating that nicotine withdrawal is  associated with

DAL Protocol v8 20200616             Page 6 of 50 increased consumption of highly palatable foods and body weight (31 -33). The translational implications of 
studying this behavioral phenotype are clear and significant and include: 1) informing clinical approaches to 
treating weight gain d uring smoking abstinence, 2) identifying potential biomarkers associated with nicotine 
addiction, and 3) addressing two significant public health concerns.  
 
GLP-1 receptor ligands are currently FDA -approved for the treatment of type II diabetes mellitus (3 4, 35) and 
obesity (36). Re -purposing an existing FDA -approved treatment that has been “de -risked” (i.e., previously shown 
to be safe) in numerous clinical trials (37 -40) removes a key barrier for drug development and reduces the 
resources required to brin g new drugs to market (41, 42).  
 
Our promising preclinical data, combined with evidence that GLP -[ADDRESS_874808] Target Quit Date (TQD) in treatment -seeking daily cigarette smokers.  
 
Aim 1 : Determine the effects of the G LP-[ADDRESS_874809] liraglutide on smoking behavior in daily cigarette 
smokers during a quit attempt.  
 
Hypothesis 1: Compared to placebo, liraglutide will improve abstinence rates (i.e., 7 -day point prevalence) at  12- 
and [ADDRESS_874810] Target Quit 
Date (TQD) in treatment -seeking daily cigarette smokers, relative to baseline (Week 1). 
 
Aim 2 : Evaluate the effects of the GLP-[ADDRESS_874811] liraglutide on body weight gain in daily cigarette smokers 
during a quit attempt.  
 
Hypothesis 2: Compared to placebo, liraglutide will attenuate body weight gain at [ADDRESS_874812] TQD 
follow -up. 
 
3.3. Exploratory Aims  
We will explor e the mechanisms by [CONTACT_651800]. 
Specifically, we will assess food intake (i.e., total calories consumed) and the rewarding value of food (Week 0 v s. 
Week 5) and whether these changes are correl ated with weight gain and quit rates.  
 
4. STUDY DESIGN  
 
4.1. General Design  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  
This material is the property of the University of Pennsylvania . 
DAL Protocol v8 20200616             Page 7 of 50 This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel arm pi[INVESTIGATOR_651772] -subjects factor 
of medication group (liraglutide  vs. placebo). After confirming eligibility during the Intake Visit ( Week -1), 
participants will complete a 32 -week study, which is divided into two phases: a 5-week Run -up Pre -Quit Phase 
(aka Pre -Quit period) and a 6 -month Cessation Follow -up Phase (aka M onitoring period). Participants will attend 
a Baseline visit/Lab session 1 (Week 1) to assess baseline smoking rate, body weight, food intake (measured via 
three days of 24 -hr food recalls), and food craving . At Lab Visit Week  1, subjects will be randomize d to one of two 
groups (liraglutide or placebo; 1:1 ratio). The dosing regimen, which follows FDA guidelines will begin at 0.6 mg 
and increase weekly by 0.6 mg until the recommended dose of 3 mg is reached (Weeks 1 through 5) and will 
continue at the 3 mg dose through the end of the study (Week 32). Side effects and smoking rate will be assessed 
at Weeks 2, 3, and 4 (Figure 1). During Week 5, subjects will complete Lab session [ADDRESS_874813] behavioral 
counseling session to prepare them for the TQD (typi[INVESTIGATOR_651773]). Participants will receive smoking 
cessation counseling at Weeks 6 (TQD), 7, 8, 10, 12 , 18, and 26  (a total of 8 sessi ons) (43). Participants will attend 
Monitoring Visits at Weeks 18 and 32 [EOT] to assess biochemical verification of smoking abstinence, body weight, 
and side effects.  
 
Rationale for Study Design  
An improved understanding and targeting of the mechanisms th at underlie smoking relapse is the most efficient 
path for developi[INVESTIGATOR_651774] (44 -46). Our well -validated paradigm (47 -51) addresses 
this issue in two ways. First, it allows for a naturalistic evaluation of changes in smoking be havior during the drug 
run-up period . For example, it is possible that liraglutide has effects on smoking behavior at a dose lower than the 
3 mg dose indicated for weight management (i.e., smokers in the liraglutide may reduce smoking prior to the 
target q uit day). Thus, by [CONTACT_651801], important information will be 
gained from this study. Moreover, there is evidence that longer pre -treatment periods are effective strategies for 
improving the efficacy of pharmacother apy for smoking cessation  (138, 139) . Second, and most importantly, we 
will capi[INVESTIGATOR_651775]. Elucidating the mechanisms that underlie relapse will both advance 
knowledge and provide new targets for subsequent population -specific treatment development (46).  
 
We chose a six-month  follow -up duration for  several reasons. First, six months meets the recommendations for 
smoking cessation trials (52), treatment guidelines (53), and the inclusion criteria for systematic reviews and meta -
analyses (54). Second, several studies indicate that, compared to placebo , liraglutide produces significant changes 
in body weight following 6 months of treatment (55, 56). Although post -cessation weight gain can continue up to 
12 months after quitting smoking (57, 58), the majority of weight gain occurs within 3 -6 months of qu itting (9, 10) 
and many individuals maintain this increased weight [ADDRESS_874814] -cessation (11 -13) suggesting that longer

DAL Protocol v8 [ADDRESS_874815] critical time period after quitting smoking. Assessment of food intake at 
Baseline (week 1), week 5, week 18 ([ADDRESS_874816] -TQD), and week 32 (26  weeks pos t-TQD) will allow us to 
capture increases in food intake that initially drive and subsequently sustain weight gain (59 -61). 
 
Randomization and Blinding  
Neither the investigators nor study staff working with participants will have access to randomization st atus. Only 
the Data Manager will know which study group participants were assigned to. Participants will be assigned to 
liraglutide or placebo using a 1:[ADDRESS_874817] Manager (on behalf of the PI/Study Physician) will contact [CONTACT_651802] . The person breaking 
the code will record the date , time,  and reason  for breaking the blind in the CRFs. All codes will be stored for the 
duration of the research study . 
 
4.2. Study Duration  
Participants will be involved in study -related activities for approximately 8 months from initial eligibility 
assessment in the clinic through follow -up. A participant’s length of time in the study may be affected by [CONTACT_651803] [ADDRESS_874818] to allow for IRB approval, development of the Data Management 
System, and staff tr aining. We estimate enrolling ~2 -3 smokers per month over an 18 -20 month recruitment 
period (Months 3 -22). We estimate that 40 people will complete the study by [CONTACT_43380] 30, and that analyses and 
the final study report will be complete by [CONTACT_43380] 36.  
 
5. CHARACTER ISTICS OF THE STUDY POPULATION  
 
5.1. Target Population  
Adult s (N=40; 20 female and 20 male) who have smoked cigarettes at least [ADDRESS_874819] 6 months

our prior studies (51, 63). To maximize retention, we will: (a) schedule sessions at convenient times; (b) maintain 
close contact; and (c) provide compensation. All study procedures and visits will occur at the Ce nter for 
Interdisciplinary Research on Nicotine Addiction (CIRNA) at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, PA.

Children, pregnant women, fetuses, neonates, or prisoners are not included in this research study . 
 
Educationally or economically disadvantaged persons are included but not solely targete d for recruitment.  
Cognitively impaired persons are not included in the current study. Because of our recruitment efforts for this 
study, it is possible that University of Pennsylvania employees and students may be invited to participate. Status 
of partic ipation in the study will be independent of the subject’s work or school activities.  Penn affiliates will be 
informed that their decision of whether to participate will not impact their standing with the institution.  
 
5.6. Subject Recruitment  
Subjects will be recruited from several sources including television, radio, newspaper advertisements, and from 
the Endocrinology and Metabolic Medicine Services at the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_111464], Presby[CONTACT_124266][INVESTIGATOR_307], and Pennsylvania Hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. [CONTACT_651856] will oversee the integration of this study into the clinics, ensuring 
access to participants and referring eligible individuals to this research study.  Study brochures will be distributed 
in patient clinics, such as the Endocrinology and M etabolic Medicine Services overseen by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Amaro, and at other

After completing  the necessary training and clinic clearances to access PennChart for participating UPHS clinics, 
Research Assistants (RAs) will review the elec tronic medical records to identify potential subjects on a weekly 
basis (each site has patient smoking status indicated on the record). Individual medical records will be evaluated 
for eligibility based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria for this stud y. Daily clinic schedules will be ascertained 
and RAs will approach patients prior to or after consultation or treatment at the clinic. In addition to in -clinic 
recruitment, RAs will contact [CONTACT_651806] (after EMR review) by [CONTACT_651807]’s specified research contact [CONTACT_245233]. Providers may choose one of the following contact [CONTACT_329006]: 1) 
all patients identified as initially eligible may be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] 2) all patient records identified as initially eligible will 
be sent to the provider via PennChart for review and approval prior to contact 3) all patient records identified as 
initially eligible may be sent to the provider, who assumes full responsibility and discretion regarding the research 
contact (no contact [CONTACT_651808]). Those patients deemed eligible for contact [CONTACT_651809]. RAs will introduce the research study and the collaboration between the researchers, 
infectious disease clinic, and the patient’s provider. After as sessing the patient’s interest, weight, and smoking 
status, the patient will then be provided with additional study information and an opportunity to assess his/her 
intake eligibility based on a screening questionnaire. Research Recruitment Best Practice A dvisories (BPAs) will 
also be integrated into electronic medical record recruitment. BPAs are designed to fire passive alerts within 
PennChart at the point of care, notifying providers that a patient may be eligible for a specific study. This specific 
BPA will evaluate if a patient meets specific criteria associated with the trial and will present the provider with the 
option to indicate if a patient is interested in participating in the study or not. This BPA will only present if the 
patient meets the init ial screening criteria based on smoking status and problem list diagnoses and will only 
present in specified departments. This indication of interest only serves to trigger a notification to study staff that 
a patient has met initial screen criteria and fu rther follow -up is requested to determine eligibility of the patient. 
This alert is a passive alert and will not interrupt the provider’s workflow, but will be listed in the same section as 
other clinically warranted BPAs.  
 
Potential participants will comp lete an initial eligibility assessment online or by [CONTACT_648], reducing the likelihood 
that participants attend an Intake Visit only to learn that they are ineligible. In addition, the pre -screen assessment 
allows for the ascertainment of physician’s clearance  should the participant have a medical condition that affects 
safety with using liraglutide. If a potential participant cannot be reached by [CONTACT_648], RAs may send a text for the 
purposes of scheduling an initial eligibility screening  phone call. This will he lp to reach pote ntial participants who 
express  interest in the study but do not answer phone calls from unrecognized numbers or do not regularly listen 
to voicemail messages. Texts will be sent from a central study account and not from the personal cellpho nes of 
any research staff. Participants who are  interested/eligible at pre -screen will complete the  Intake session with 
research staff . At this Intake session , participants will review and sign a combined informed consent and HIPAA 
authorization form, comp lete eligibility and baseline assessments, and be scheduled for their Lab Visit 1 (Week 1). 
Participants’ eligibility will be confirmed by [INVESTIGATOR_124] . Ashar e or a member of the study team . 
 
Referral Bonus Program  
Participants who achieve their final study visit (Week 32) will be given the opportunity to receive a small bonus 
for referring others to the study. If the person who is referred completes the initial eligibility screen, regardless of 
outcome, the study participant will be awarded $ 10 per referral, for a  maximum of 2 referrals ($ 20). 
 
5.7. Early Withdrawal of Subjects  
Participa tion is voluntary and participants can withdraw from the study at any time. Study participants will be 
asked about the reason(s) for voluntary  withdrawal (if applicable) and the presence of  any AEs. AEs will be 
followed -up when appropriate. Participants who withdraw from the study will be instructed to return any unused 
study drug (if applicable).

DAL Protocol v8 20200616             Page 12 of 50 Withdrawal Criteria  
Participants may be withdra wn from the study for the following reasons:  
1. Pregnancy or intention of becoming pregnant.  
2. Applicable adverse event.  
3. Severe non -compliance with study protocol/design, including missing a mandatory visit.  
4. Any medical condition, illness, disorder, or concomit ant medication that could compromise participant 
safety or performance, as determined by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or Study Physician.  
5. Intolerance of the 3mg dose of the study medication.  
 
Replacement of Study Participants  
Participants who withdraw fr om the study or fail to meet study requirements prior to completing Lab Visit 2 (Week 
5) will be replaced to ensure that [ADDRESS_874827] research (65 -67), we will enroll 40 more smokers  to account for those unable 
to complete the study.  
 
6. STUDY DRUG  
 
6.1. Description  
Liraglutide  
Liraglutide 3.0 mg ( Saxenda®) is an injectable medicine that may help some adults with excess weight (BMI ≥27) 
who also have weight -related medical problems or obesity (BMI ≥30) lose weight and keep the weight off. 
Liraglutide is approved by [CONTACT_941] U.S. Food and Drug Administrat ion (FDA) for chronic weight management when 
combined with a reduced -calorie meal plan and physical activity. Liraglutide comes in a pre -filled pen and is self -
injected one time per day into the abdomen, thigh, or upper arm area. Liraglutide belongs to a c lass of medications 
called glucagon -like peptide -1 (GLP -1) receptor agonists. The human  body naturally produces glucagon -like 
peptide -1 (GLP -1), which helps regulate appetite. Liraglutide works like GLP -1. When activated by [CONTACT_539775], the 
GLP-1 receptor stimulates the release of insulin into the bloodstream. Evidence shows that liraglutide may reduce 
appetite.  
 
Placebo  
The placebo is an inactive substance that is designed to look like the study drug but contains no medication.  
 
6.2. Treatment Regimen  
The dosin g regimen, which follows FDA guidelines and is documented to be safe and well -tolerated in prior clinical 
studies, will begin at 0.6 mg and increase weekly by 0.6 mg until the recommended dose of 3 mg is reached (Weeks 
1 through 5) and will continue at the  3 mg dose through the end of the study (Week 32). Each pen contains 18mg 
of liraglutide and can be adjusted to any of the 5 doses (i.e., once the 3 mg dose is reached, the pen lasts 6 days). 
Thus, with the current dosing regimen, each participant will nee d approximately 34 pens to complete the study. 
If a participant does not tolerate an increased dose of study medication during dose escalation, dose escalation 
may be delayed for approximately one additional week.  
 
6.3. Preparation and Packaging of Study Drug  
Liraglutide (Saxenda®)  6mg/ml strength  solution  for subcutaneous injection and matched placebo pens will be 
manufactured and provided by [CONTACT_3454]. Study medication will be packed blinded and the packaging will be 
QA released by  [CONTACT_651810] . The study medication and placebo pens  will 
be shipped with a randomization list.  Clinical Supplies Novo Nordisk will also supply  a DFU (directions for use) that 
will be given to study participants along with the liraglutide/pla cebo pens.  
 
6.4. Subject Compliance and Monitoring  
CONFIDENTIAL  
This material is the property of the University of Pennsylvania . 
DAL Protocol v8 [ADDRESS_874828] used study medication pens, when possible, at in -person visits. Unused pens may be used to  verify the 
medication adherence data.  All discrepancies will be explored and recorded as  appropriate. Adherence will be 
defined as greater than or equal to 80% compliance with the study regimen. If a dose is missed, the once -daily 
regimen shou ld be resumed as prescribed with the next scheduled dose. An extra dose or increase in dose should 
not be taken to make up for the missed dose. If more than [ADDRESS_874829]  to the University of Pennsylvania 
Investigational Drug Service (IDS). Upon receipt of the study treatment supplies, an inve ntory must be performed 
and a proof of receipt filled out and signed by [CONTACT_17247]. It is important that IDS staff 
counts and verifies that the shipment contains all the items noted in the shipment inventory. Any damaged or 
unusable study medication in a given shipment (active drug or placebo) will be documented in the study files 
maintained at IDS.  
 
6.5.2.  Storage of Study Drug  
The IDS will store the medication per manufacturer guidelines. Specifically, prior to being dispensed to 
participants, liraglutide will be stored in a refrigerator between 36ºF to 46ºF (2ºC to 8ºC). It will not be stored in 
the freezer or directly adjacent  to the refrigerator cooling element.  
 
Participants will be told that after initial use of the pen, the pen can be stored for 30 days in a refrigerator (36°F 
to 46°F; 2°C to 8°C)  or at room temperature (59°F to 86°F; 15°C to 30°C . Participants will be ins tructed to keep the 
pen cap on when not in use and that the pen should be protected from excessive heat and sunlight. In addition, 
participants will be instructed to always remove and safely discard the needle into a sharps container after each 
injection a nd store the pen without an injection needle attached.  
 
6.5.3.  Dispensing of Study Drug  
Kits will be assigned  and ordered from IDS  as needed by [CONTACT_651811] a locked refrigerator  at 
our center. Once the Study Physician ([CONTACT_651857]) confirms eligibility, the subject will be assigned the 
next [ADDRESS_874830] , and the prescription will be signed by [CONTACT_651812] . The randomization number encodes the treatment the participant will receive (liraglutide or 
placebo) . The study medication will be dispensed using a unique Dispensing Unit Number (DUN) to ensure that 
the product supplied to each participant matche s the treatment allocation. Participants who are ineligible or who 
do not enroll in t he study will not receive study medication. The Data Manager will maintain a separate database 
linking the participant ’s study ID with the DUN. This database will only be accessible to the Data Manager.  Due to 
the COVID -[ADDRESS_874831] been mo dified to allow for situations in which study staff are not able 
to pi[INVESTIGATOR_651777]/or subjects are not able to attend their visit in -person and collect their study 
medication. The staff will work with IDS to determine the possibility of shipp ing the medication to the subject. 
Staff will confirm with the subject prior to shipment that they are able to receive deliveries and confirm their 
address.  
 
6.5.4.  Reconciliation and Return/ Destruction of Study Drug  
Regular study drug reconciliation will be perf ormed to document drug assigned, drug used, and drug remaining. 
Any returned and/or unused medication will be stored separately from used study medication. This reconciliation 
will be logged in the study database . 
CONFIDENTIAL  
This material is the property of the University of Pennsylvania . 
DAL Protocol v8 20200616             Page 14 of 50  
At the completion of the study, there wil l be a final reconciliation of drug shipped, drug consumed, and drug 
remaining. This reconciliation will be logged on the drug reconciliation form, signed, and dated by [CONTACT_237766].  Any discrepancies noted will be investigated, resolved, and documen ted prior to return or destruction of 
unused study drug. Drug destroyed on site will be documented in the study files.  
 
7. STUDY PROCEDURES  
 
7.1. Pre-Screening  
Recruited subjects will complete an initial eligibility screening online via REDCap or over the telephone. This pre -
screening reduces the likelihood that participants attend an Intake Visit only to learn that they are ineligible and/ or 
to allow us to ascertain physician’s clearance should the participant have a medical condition that requ ires 
approval . Participants who complete  this pre -screening and are deemed potentially eligible will be invited to 
attend an Intake Visit. The Intake Visit must occur within [ADDRESS_874832] 
approximately 3 hours  if conducted entirely in -person . Participants may be asked to complete the consenting 
process remotely. Subjects may be contact[CONTACT_626174] (HIPAA -compliant) for a videoconference or by [CONTACT_648]. 
Staff will review the consent form and answer all questions. Staff will then administer a comprehension 
questionnaire and review incorrect answers as needed. Subjects who are unable to provide an electronic signature 
[CONTACT_329067] a physical version of the consent that must be mailed back to us prior to continuing with the Intake 
tasks.  During this visit, participants will: 
 Provide a urine sample (at least 30ml [two tablespoons]) for drug and (if applicable) pregnancy tests.  If 
participants  test positive for cocaine, methamphetamines, PCP, barbiturates, and/or ecstasy (MDMA)  
may not be eligible to participate in this study. Results from these tests are used for research purposes 
only. They will not be shared with the participants and will not be placed in the participant’s electronic 
medical record. The participant  will be informed of his/her  eligibility status after testing, but specific 
results will not be shared. Some OTC and other non -exclusionary medications are known to cause false -
positives on urine drug screens. If a participant is believed to have a false -positive result on the urine drug  
screen, the participant may continue in the study with investigator approval.  Urine samples will be 
discarded after testing.  
 Female participants only: If the result of the pregnancy test is positive, the participant  will not be eligible 
to participate in this study.  
 Provide a breath sample for a carbon monoxide (CO) assessment to confirm smoking status. Carbon 
monoxide is a poisonous gas that comprises less than 1% of the air we breathe and is also produced 
through smoking a cigarette.  
 Complete brief psyc hiatric assessments called the ‘MINI’ interview , ‘C-SSRS’,  and ‘CES -D’ questionnaire . 
During these assessments , research staff  will ask participants  about any current and past depressed mood 
symptoms as well as other psychiatric symptoms. * 
 Complete a medic al history form with a member of the research team and provide information on 
medications participants  are currently taking or recently discontinued. * 
 Have height, weight, blood pressure , and heart rate  measured.  
 Complete a brief physical examination led b y a medical professional.  
 Have blood sugar measured via a finger prick and a handheld glucose monitor.

(Weeks 1 & 5 [+/- 2 days] ). Subjects may be asked to  complete some of these procedures remotely using Blue 
Jeans (HIPAA -compliant) or by [CONTACT_651815]. Participants will 
be asked NOT to eat anything for at least one hour before these visits. During these visi ts, participants  will: 
 Provide a urine sample (at least 30ml [two tablespoons]) for drug and (if applicable) pregnancy tests.  If 
participants  test positive for cocaine, methamphetamines, PCP, barbiturates, and/or ecstasy (MDMA) , 
they  may not be able to con tinue in the study. Results from these tests are used for research purposes 
only. They will not be shared with the participant  and will not be placed in their  electronic medical record. 
The p articipant  will be informed of his/her  eligibility status after testing, but specific results will not be 
shared. Some OTC and other non -exclusionary medications are known to cause false -positives on urine 
drug screens. If a participant is believed to have a false -positive result on the urine d rug screen, the 
participant may continue in the study with investigator approval.  Urine samples will be discarded after 
testing.   
 Female participants only: If the result of the pregnancy test is positive, the participant  will not be able to 
continue in the  study.

7.2.5.  Final Check -in 
Four weeks (+7 days) after the last study visit, study staff  will contact [CONTACT_651816] t o ask about 
smoking status (TLFB) and any delayed side effects the participant  may have experienced. This call will take up 
to 15 minutes to complete.  
 
7.2.6.  Visit Reminders  
For each scheduled study visits participants  will receive appointment reminders via phone call, email, or text 
message (depending on their preference). These reminders will occur 24 – 48 hours prior to study  visits and will 
include important information for the study  visit, such as location.  
 
7.2.7.  Remote  Study Participation  
The COVID -19 pandemic has resulted in changes to study procedures due to difficulty completing in -person 
sessions. In the event that a participant is unable to attend an in -person visit, either due to personal reasons or 
office closure , procedures will be modified to allow for remote collection of data. The procedure for visit 
reminders will remain the same. Participants will be contact[CONTACT_651817], as well as to remind them that the se ssion will be conducted by [CONTACT_648]. Staff will call participants to 
complete all measures that can be completed by [CONTACT_648]. If collected on -site using session paperwork, these data 
will be stored in the participants’ charts and locked in secure filing cabinets , as is standard procedure. In the event 
that research staff are off -site, they will utilize  Pulse Secure to enable a secure, remote connection to their 
desktops and the secure server. Data collected remotely will be stored on our secure server, and later transcribed 
to paper measures and stored in participant charts. Items that are typi[INVESTIGATOR_651779], including counseling binders  and study materials related to medication 
use (e.g. medicati on pen needles, sharps containers etc.).  All study sessions can be conducted remotely with the 
exception of the Intake, Week 1, Week 5, Week 18, and Week [ADDRESS_874834] of COVID -19 Quitting Experience Survey  
 
Enrolled participants who completed their final counseling visit  (Week 26 ) as of 3/30/[ADDRESS_874835] needed to 
clarify any information collected during the survey. Participants will also be asked to provide verbal consent for 
the recording of the survey. If a participant does not consen t to completing the survey or being recorded, the 
survey will not be administered, and the call will be ended. Th e call will be recorded using staff recorders (typi[INVESTIGATOR_651780]).  All recordings will be stored on our secure s erver, and only staff will have 
access to those files. Recordings will be used to ensure participant responses were captured exactly when the data 
is reviewed. Staff will complete the survey via RedCap (i.e. reading off questions and recording answers), an d no 
other personal information will be collected.  
 
The survey will include 24 questions recommended by [CONTACT_651818] -19, 11 questions 
related to smoking behavior and the pandemic formulated by [CONTACT_3655], and the PHQ -2 and GAD -2 meas ures for 
depression and anxiety symptoms (4 questions total). If a participant scores a 3 or higher on either the PHQ -2 or 
GAD -2 measure, they will be offered resources for copi[INVESTIGATOR_4262].  
 
7.4. Description of Study Measures & Procedures  
 
7.4.1.  Smoking Cessation Behavioral Counseling  
All participant s will receive manual -based counseling from either [CONTACT_329069] or a counselor trained and supervised 
by [CONTACT_329020]. Ashare. The counseling protocol is based on PHS guidelines for smoking cessation treatment (53), 
used in [CONTACT_329069]’s prior work (68). The initial 1 -hour session ( Pre-Quit Session ; Week 5) begins with a review of 
smoking and quitting history, reasons for smoking and quitting, triggers for smoking, obtaining social support for 
quitting, and self -monitoring of smoking (69). The 2nd session (T arget Quit Date; Week 6 ) will focus on the quit 
day experiences given that the participant will have been instructed to quit the morning of this session. The 
benefits of quitting will be emphasized along with evaluating a nd reinforcing progress with cessation, managing 
triggers, slip management and recovery, and relapse prevention (70 -72). Sessions 3 through 8 (Booster sessions; 
Weeks 7, 8, 10, 12 , 18, and 26 ) will include evaluating and reinforcing progress with cessation , reviewing trigger 
management, relapse prevention, problem solving difficulties, and challenges such as slips. The counseling 
sessions are designed to enhance awareness of the harmful effects of smoking, assist the person in developi[INVESTIGATOR_651781]. Training and quality assurance measures will be established to ensure optimal 
delivery of the smoking cessation protocol.  Counselor adherence to the treatment protocol will also be facilitated 
by [CONTACT_250061].  
 
7.4.2.  Screening/Covariates  
Medical History  & Physical Examination : A medical history (self -report) and a physical examination will be 
conducted at the Intake Visit to review for any contraindications listed previously. The medical history (including 
height and weight) will be completed by a research staff member. The brief physical examination will be led by a 
medical professional. Current medical conditions and  medications will be documented.  
 
Demographics , Smoking  & Alcohol  History : Standard questionnaires will be self -administered at the Intake Visit (in-
person or remote via REDCap) to collect the following data: demographics (age, gender, marital status, and 
education), age at smoking initiation, cigarette brand, length of prior abstinence periods , current smoking rate , and 
number of alcoholic drinks consumed in the past [ADDRESS_874836] for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) will 
be administered. This [ADDRESS_874837] instrument for assessing the intensity of physical addiction  to 
nicotine . It has good internal consistency (α = .64) and high test -retest reliability (r = .88) (78). Smoking rate and 
alcohol use will be assessed throughout the study using a standard timeline follow -back (TLFB) method at each 
study visit.  
 
Psychiatric History : Current depression, lifetime prevalence of psychosis, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, 
hypoma nic/manic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], substance abuse , and suicide attempts  will be determined via self -report during the 
phone screen and via semi -structured interview using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) , 
CONFIDENTIAL  
This material is the property of the University of Pennsylvania . 
DAL Protocol v8 [ADDRESS_874838] (AUDIT),  the Center for Epi[INVESTIGATOR_2557] -Depression (CES -D) 
questionnaire , and the Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS) . The MINI is a 10 -15 minute structured 
interview developed to assess major DSM -V Axis 1 psychiatric diagnoses. Th is instrument permits both current 
(past 30 days) and lifetime assessments of psychiatric illness and recent data support its reliability and validity. 
The MINI will be administered by a trained research staff member at the Intake Visit (in-person or remot e via 
phone or videoconference) . The C -SSRS is a two -page structured interview developed by [CONTACT_64840], the 
University of Pennsylvania, and the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_651782]. There will be 100% review of paper MINIs and C -SSRSs by [CONTACT_195462], Stephanie 
Josephson, LCSW,  with relevant trainin g, to maintain quality control. The AUDIT is a 10 -item measure that was 
developed by [CONTACT_38375] (WHO) as a simple metho d of screening for excessive drinking. The 
Center for Epi[INVESTIGATOR_2557] -Depression (CES -D) questionnaire is a [ADDRESS_874839] week they experienced symptoms associated with depression, such as re stless 
sleep, poor appetite, and feeling lonely. Response options range from 0 to 3 for each item (0 = Rarely or None of 
the Time, 1 = Some or Little of the Time, 2 = Moderately or Much of the time, 3 = Most or Almost All the Time). 
Scores range from 0 to 60, with high scores indicating greater depressive symptoms. Because th ese assessments  
may cause an adverse emotional reaction, staff will be trained to deal with such reactions and to provide 
additional referrals if needed. If necessary, referrals to appr opriate psychological services will be provided.  
 
Blood Pressure :  At the Intake  Visit , participants presenting with elevated blood pressure (i.e., systolic blood 
pressure greater than 159 and/or diastolic blood pressure greater than 99) will have a second  blood pressure 
reading taken after a ten minute period in which the participants will be instructed to sit comfortably.  If, after the 
second reading, systolic blood pressure remains greater than 159 and/or diastolic remains greater than 99, the 
participa nt will be ineligible for the study, unless determined otherwise by [CONTACT_1016] [INVESTIGATOR_651783], upon 
review.   
 
Blood pressure will be measured at all subsequent in -person visits. If participants present with elevated blood 
pressure (i.e., systolic blo od pressure greater than 159 and/or diastolic blood pressure greater than 99) at any 
subsequent visit, the staff will follow the same steps listed above. If, after the second reading, systolic blood 
pressure remains greater than 159 and/or diastolic remain s greater than 99, the Study Physician or Study PI [INVESTIGATOR_651784]. Research staff will 
follow up with the participant accordingly.  
 
Blood Glucose  Monitoring:  Because liraglutide  may lower blood glucose, glucose levels will be measured at each 
study visit. If the participant is unable to attend a monitoring visit in person, the blood glucose monitoring would 
be collected during in -person visits at Intake, Week 1, Week 5 , Week 18,  and Week 32. As recommended by [CONTACT_651819] (NIDDK), blood glucose levels in non -diabetic 
individuals less than 70 mg/dl may indicate hypoglycemia . The Abbott Precision Xtra Blood Glucose &  Ketone  
Monitoring System will be used to measure blood glucose 
(https://freestyleserver.com/Payloads/IFU/2017july/ART24315 -002_rev -A_WEB.pdf ). This device is indicated for 
home and professional use . As recommended by [CONTACT_3455] , the device will be c leaned and disinfected 
after each use. A trained member of the research staff will obtain a drop of blood (approximately 0.3 microliter) 
via a finger prick using a lancing device. The device provides a blood glucose reading within [ADDRESS_874840] a blood glucose level less than 70 mg/dl will be provided a beverage containing 15 g of carbohydrate 
(e.g., fruit juice or soft drink) and asked to wait in the laboratory. After 15 minutes, blood glucose will be rechecked 
to ensure it is greater th an 70 mg/dl before allowing the participant to leave. Participants who present with blood 
glucose less than 70 mg/dl may be withdrawn from the study.  
 
Shipley -2: All participants will complete the Shipley -2, a revision and restandardization of the Shipley Institute of 
Living Scale (SILS) , at the Intake Visit.  The Shipley -[ADDRESS_874841] designed to assess general 
intellectual functioning in adults and adolescents and to aid in identifying cognitive impairments  (140) . The scale 
consists of two subtests, a [ADDRESS_874842] thinking. The total administration

study staff will sc ore the test  using Shipley -2 AutoScore Forms .  
 
Withdrawal Symptoms : The Minnesota Nicotine Withdrawal Scale -Revised  will measure withdrawal symptoms 
associated with quitting smoking (79). The scale assesses  eight DSM -IV items of nicotine withdrawal includ ing: 
dysphoria or depressed mood, insomnia, irritability/frustration/anger, anxiety, decreased heart rate, difficulty 
concentrating, restlessness, and increased appetite/weight gain.  Participants will rate the intensity of their 
symptoms on the following s cale: 0 = none, 1 = slight, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, 4 = severe and a summary score will 
be calculated.  
 
Cigarette Craving : The well -validated and reliable 10 -item brief Questionnaire of Smoking Urges -Brief  (QSU -B) will 
assess craving for cigarettes (80, 81). The QSU -B contains 2 subscales (anticipation of reward, relief from negative 
affect).  
 
Mood : The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) will be used to measure positive mood and negative 
mood (PANAS) (8 2-84). The two subscales (Positive Affect [PA; 10 items, e.g., enthusiastic, strong ] and Negative 
Affect [NA; 10 items, e.g., distressed, upset ]) have 10 items each, are internally consistent in both non -psychiatric 
and psychiatric samples (α = .79 to 91),  and exhibit good convergent and discriminant validity.  
 
Physical Activity : Physical activity will be assessed with the 7 -day Physical Activity Recall (PAR) (85 -88). The PAR 
has excellent test -retest reliability (r=0.81) and validity (r = 0.72 heart rate monitor) (89). It is a widely used 
measure of habitual activity (86, 90, 91).  The PAR provides data on frequency, intensity, duration, and kilocalories 
expended.  
 
Weight Concerns : Weight concerns associated with quitting smoking will be measured with a reliable (alpha =.87) 
and valid 6 –item scale (108, 109). The score is the averag e of the responses to all items (1= not at all to 10 = very 
much).  
 
Food Craving Questionnaire & Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire : Habitual food cravings will be assessed with 
the trait version of the Food Craving Questionnaire  (FCQ -T). This valid and reliable 39 -item measure asks 
participants to indicate on a 6-point scale the  frequency of food craving (never to always) (92, 93).  The Dutch 
Eating Behavior Questionnaire will assess restrained eating ([ADDRESS_874844] food intake), external 
eating (10 items, tendency to eat in response to food related cues) and emotional eating (13 items, tendency to 
eat in response to emotions) (94 -97). These scales are associated with food craving and response to food cues 
(98-100). Partic ipants indicate on a Likert -style scale how often each item is applicable to them (1 = never to 
5=very often). Disinhibition will be measured with a subscale (16 items) of the Eating Inventory (101 -103) that is 
thought to reflect responsivity to environmen tal food cues (104), and internal cues (105), and linked to food 
reinforcement and weight change (106, 107).  
 
Cigarette Ratings and Subjective Effects : The Cigarette Evaluation Scale (CES), developed to asses s subjective 
effects of smoking,  is an [ADDRESS_874845] sensations. The Rose Sensory Questionnaire (SQ), a [ADDRESS_874846] and asks participants to rate 
the strength of the cigarette puffs on  the participant’s  tongue, nose, back of mouth and throa t, windpi[INVESTIGATOR_5836], and 
chest. The CES and SQ will be administered at Intake and at Laboratory Visits 1 and 2 .    
 
7.4.3.  Questionnaires  
Concomitant Medication Review : At the Intake Visit, participants will be asked to list all medications (prescription 
or non -prescription) and/or supplements currently taken and/or recently discontinued (within the past 14 days ) 
as a baseline collection. All information will be collected  on a Concomitant Illness/Medication Log that will be 
maintained in the participant’s study chart. Participants who present with a concomitant illness will not be eligible 
to participate (see Exclusion Criteria above). At every subsequent session , particip ants will be asked if they  have 
taken any additional medications (prescription or non -prescription), supplements, and/or changed the dosage of 
any previously reported medications/supplements since their last session . Information collected will include the 
start date, stop date (if applicable), and indication. The Study Physician and/or Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_651785]/or study eligibility determinations on a case -by-case basis.

DAL Protocol v8 20200616             Page 21 of 50 Symptom s Evaluation /Side Effects  Checklist : A checklist of symptoms/ side effects based on the  liraglutide  product 
insert will be administered to participants at all study visits starting at Baseline/Lab Visit 1 (Week 1). The frequency 
and severity of common side effects of liraglutide  will be rated on a 0 (none) to 3 (severe) scale  and can be summed 
to provide an overall side effects index . An open -ended side effects question will also be included. Furthermore, 
participants will receive written instructions to call the Study Physician should they experience any severe side 
effects or adverse events between study visits.  
 
 
 
7.4.4.  Food -Related  Tasks  
Individualized Food Preferences ( Pre-FCQ-S): In preparation for the food cue -induced craving task, participants 
will rate how appetizing they find pi[INVESTIGATOR_249841] (e.g., cupcakes, fruits, vegetables) at the Intake Visit. Foods 
rated least appetizing (n=20) and foods rated most appetizing (n=20) will be selected to create personalized food 
cue stimuli.  
 
 
Food Cue -Induced Craving Task : The food cue -induced craving computer task will present (5 sec) 20 pi[INVESTIGATOR_651786] (at Intake) as most appetizing and 20 pi[INVESTIGATOR_249825] (at Intake) least appetizing, and 20 pi[INVESTIGATOR_651787] a water glass. Participants will be instructed to imagine  tasting and e ating the pi[INVESTIGATOR_651788]. Order of presentation is randomized  and the task consists of 60 events separated by [CONTACT_183001] -
stimuli interval (fixation point) ranging from 2 -11 sec  (mean 5.5 sec). The food craving assessment i s the 3 -item 
“desire” subscale of the reliable and valid state version of the Food Craving Questionnaire (FCQ -S). Total task time: 
~10 minutes.  
 
 
Food Intake (24 -Hr Dietary Recalls) : Participants  will complete three 24 -Hour Dietary Recall assessments at fo ur 
separate time points ( prior to Weeks 1, 5, 18, & 32; 12 assessments in total) over the course of the study. During 
each [ADDRESS_874847] the participant  over the telephone during 
a predetermined time window to discuss their  eating and drinking from the day before. The research team staff  
will use a multi -pass method with an interactive computerized software program, the ASA24® (Automated Self -
Administered  24-hour Recall), to determine t otal kcal/day . The ASA24® was created by [CONTACT_651820] (NCI). If participants are unable to complete a scheduled recall over the telephone, 
participants may be asked to complete a 24 -hour die tary recall with the research staff in -center. Comparable 
accuracy can be achieved when administered in -person and over the telephone.  Food recalls are widely used, 
reliable , and valid, assessing kcals/day within 10% of actual dietary intake measured under  laboratory observation 
and by [CONTACT_88245].  Each dietary recall  assessment will take about 30 minutes.  Dietary Recalls can be 
rescheduled up to 7 days after the corresponding in -center study visit.  
 
7.4.5.  Outcomes  
Smoking Abstinence  (Aim 1) will be asse ssed at each Monitoring Visit after the Target Quit Date (52)  and 
biochemically verified via a saliva sample at Weeks 1 & [ADDRESS_874848] -TQD  (Weeks 7 & 32) . A reliable and valid timeline 
follow -back method (110) will be used to assess daily smoking (presence and rate) (65, 67). The primary smoking 
outcome variable will be 7 -day point prevalence abstinence (no smoking, not even a puff, for at least 7 days prior 
to the assessment) biochemically verified by [INVESTIGATOR_609] < [ADDRESS_874849] -TQD ( Week 18) and EOT ([ADDRESS_874850] -TQD; Week 32) (64).  Carbon monoxide  (CO) measures will be made using a Vitalograph Breath CO Analyzer 
(McNeil Int ernational, Inc., Lenexa, KS)  or an iCO Smokerlyzer (CoVita, Santa Barbara, CA) . The manufacturer will 
have calibrated thi s device within the past year. The Vitalograph Breath CO monitor will be used at in -person visits. 
A new, disposable cardboard mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_651789].  The device has a digital screen 
which reports CO lev els in parts per million (ppm).  The iCO Smo kerlyzer can be shipped to participants and will be 
used to collect CO remotely. This is a personal carbon monoxide reader that you will connect to your phone and 
send results to the research team. You will be provided this device by [CONTACT_651821].  Participants will be asked to provide a CO breath sample by [CONTACT_41680] a large breath, holding their breath 
for two seconds, releasing the breath, then taking another deep breath and holding their breath for [ADDRESS_874851] value displayed is recorded during all

abstinence from sm oking cigarettes at Week [ADDRESS_874852] the Zoom/BlueJeans app and go into their iCO app, and do the CO reading while still on the call with the 
study staff. Once they have completed their reading, they will be instructed to send the result of the reading to 
the lab email. CO bre ath samples will be collected in -person at  Intake, Week 1, Week 5, Week 18, and Week 32. 
CO breath samples at other s essions may be collected remotely if they report abstinence.   
 
Weight Gain  (Aim 2) will be measured by [CONTACT_651822] (pounds, ounces) wearing light clothing without shoes prior 
to each session and at follow -up. Height will be measured at baseline using a mounted stadiometer and BMI 
calculated as weight (kg)/height (m)2. Pre -cess ation weight will be computed as the average of weights at the 
Intake and Baseline /Lab 1 Visits  prior to initiation of study medication. Weight change from baseline to the 26 -
week follow -up will serve as a primary weight outcome variable (58, 61, 111).  
 
7.5. Tissue Specimens  
Urine : A urine sample will be collected  at the Intake Visit and each Laboratory Visit  (Weeks 1 & 5)  for drug and (if 
applicable) pregnancy tests . Subjects who test positive for study prohibited drugs and/or pregnancy will be not be 
able to  participate in the study . The urine drug screen requires about 30ml of urine and indicates whether the 
subject has recently taken any exclusionary drugs  (cocaine, methamphetamines, PCP, barbiturates, ecstasy 
(MDMA)  or non -prescribed amphetamines,  benzodia zepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651],  methadone,  oxycodone,  and/or and opi[INVESTIGATOR_858] ). In an 
effort to remain CLIA -compliant, results from urine screening s will not be shared with participants. Participants 
will be informed that the testing is for research purposes only and that they will be informed of their eligibility 
status, but not of the specific testing results.  In addition, the current protocol does not utilize PennChart and 
therefore, results of the screening will not be added to participants’ electronic medical records. Some OTC and 
other non -exclusionary medications are known to cause false -positives on urine drug screens. If a participant is 
belie ved to have a false -positive result on the urine drug screen, the participant may continue in the study with 
investigator approval.  Urine  samples will be disposed of following the conclusion of the study visit.  
 
Blood : One 4mL EDTA tube will be collected a t Intake and sent to Quest Diagnostics for a Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) 
Test. Participants will only be considered eligible for the study if this test indicates that they do not have diabetes. 
One 8.5mL SST tube will be collected at Intake and sent to Quest Di agnostics for a Comprehensive Metabolic Panel 
(CMP) to assess kidney and liver function. Participants will only be considered eligible for the study if the Study 
Physician reviews their CMP results and determines it is safe for them to receive the study dr ug. One 10mL EDTA 
tube and one 8.5mL SST tube will be collected at e ach Laboratory Visit  (Weeks 1 & 5), Week 18, and Week [ADDRESS_874853] tube  will be  centrifuged at 1100 g (3100 RPM) for 10 minutes for serum extraction. 
Four 0.5mL serum aliquots will be stored in 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes and stored at -80°C until analysis. These 
sample will be stored at the Center for Inter disciplinary Research on Nicotine Addiction (CIRNA) and analyzed at 
the Laboratory Biomarkers, Quantitative Pharmacology, Neuroimaging, and Neurobehavioral Characterization 
Core at the Penn Mental Health AIDS Research Center  (PMHARC).  
 
Participants will be  given the option to let us store some of their blood for use in future research related to nicotine 
addiction and/or determining treatments to help people quit smoking. This future research would be reviewed 
and approved by [CONTACT_651823]. Permission to store blood for use in 
future research is optional and participants will indicate th eir choice on the informed consent form. B lood samples  
will be labeled and stored with an identification number only. Sections 10.6.1 and 10.6.2 of th is protocol provide 
information on how study samples and data will be kept private and confidential. Participants may withdraw their 
permission at any time by c ontacting study staff and letting us know they no longer want their samples to be 
stored for use in future research. It is possible participants’ samples may be used in future research for commercial

results obtained as part of future research will not be shared with participants.  
 
Saliva : If a participant reports not smoking (not even a puff of a cigarette) for at least the [ADDRESS_874854]  correlations,  and related  confidence  intervals.  Our sample  of 20 participants per group  will yield  95%  
confidence  intervals  with  limits  that fall less than  1/2 SD from  the mean.  For correlation,  the 95%  CI length  will be 
no larger  than  0.94  if r=0, and substantially  narrower  for r not equal  to 0. Because  the goal of this study  is to 
demonstrate  feasibility  and provide  preliminary  data,  we will use these  measures  to estimate  interaction  effect  
sizes  to plan  future  research.  
 
7.7. Statistical Methods  
Prior to performing analyses, we will: (a) screen for data -entry errors, (b) check for outliers and missing data, (c) 
create summary scores, and (d) check distributional assumptions. To minimize missing data we will compensate 
participants for their time a nd travel costs to maximize visit and medication adherence and participant retention 
(e.g., retention rates ~90%) (75, 122). We will assess group differences in attrition and adherence. Per convention, 
subjects who withdraw or are lost to follow -up during the Cessation Follow -Up phase will be included in the intent -
to-treat analysis and coded as smokers.  
 
For Aim 1, we will evaluate whether liraglutide improves abstinence rates (point -prevalence, binary outcome) at 
the [ADDRESS_874855] -TQD.  
 
Analyses for Aim 2 will parallel those described for Aim 1 using body weight (kg; continuous outcome) at the [ADDRESS_874856] -cessa tion 
weight gain will be mitigated by [CONTACT_651824] (and thus do not gain weight). Therefore, weight gain will 
be assessed in the context of abstinence and relapse. Although we are not powered to test the interaction of 
treatment by [CONTACT_651825] s, we will explore this possibility to inform future research.  
 
For exploratory outcomes, we will evaluate the effects of liraglutide on food intake and the reinforcing value of 
food. We will compare food intake, measured via total calories consumed report ed on the 24 -hr dietary  recalls, 
and the reinforcing value of food (i.e., maximum  amount of responding for food vs. money) following 5 -weeks of 
treatment with liraglutide or placebo. Specifically, we will use repeated measures regression models and include  
a term for time (baseline [ Week 1] vs. Week 5) in each model as well as a between -subject factor of medication

covariates related to the outcome in preliminary analyses.  
 
Interim Analysis  
Because this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we have no plans to conduct an interim analysis.  
 
Evaluability of Subjects  
All eligible smokers who complete the initial Intake  Visit  will be randomized. Consistent with intent -to-treat  
analyses, we will measure smoking cessation and weight gain in the entire sample at the [ADDRESS_874857] -TQD follow -
up (Week 10). As is the convention in smoking cessation trials, smokers who are lost to follow -up will be included 
in the analysis and counted a s smokers (65, 66, 127). We will examine the characteristics of those subjects who 
drop out to identify any associations between dropout and baseline measures. These analyses will be descriptive, 
as we expect few dropouts. Items missing at random will be i mputed prior to calculating final scores using 
conditional means, estimated with a version of Buck’s method (128). The analyses will also be repeated using only 
complete observations to assure that parameter estimates are not impacted by [CONTACT_47915].  
 
Sensi tivity Analysis  
Given the substantial changes required to study procedures due to the COVID -[ADDRESS_874858] of the transition to remote visits on study results. We will utilize a 
‘clustering’ appro ach and assess the impact of clustering by [CONTACT_651826]: comparing the analysis that ignores clustering (i.e. assumes that the data are independent) to a 
method that will account for clustering (141). T o account for clustering, we will include a variable to compare 
subjects who completed the trial pre -COVID (all in -person) to those who completed the trial post -COVID (mostly 
remote visits with some in -person tasks).  
 
8. RISKS / BENEFITS  
 
8.1. Potential Study Risks  
A detailed description of the study will be given to all participan ts, which will include the risks of participation, 
actions taken to mitigate potential loss of  confidentiality, and the knowledge that their freedom to refuse 
participation or withdra w from the study  will not affect the availability of treatment at the University of 
Pennsylvania. Informed consent procedures will comply with current standards of the IRB at the University of 
Pennsylvania. Subjects can choose, as an alternative, not to enroll in this study. Adverse reactions will be assessed 
and reported as required by [CONTACT_651827] U niversity .  
 
Study Medication (liraglutide):   
In several clinical trials that lasted at least one year, the following side effects were reported in greater than 5% 
of people taking liraglutide and more frequently than in people taking a placebo:  
 Nausea   Low blood sugar  (Hypoglycemia)  
 Diarrhea   Constipa tion 
 Vomiting   Abdominal pain  
 Indigestion   Headache  
 Dizziness   Fatigue  
 Increased lipase  
  
The clinical significance of elevations in lipase or amylase with Saxenda ® is unknown in the absence of other signs 
and symptoms of pancreatitis.  
 
Adverse reactions reported in greater than or equal to 2% of people taking liraglutide and more frequently than 
in people taking a placebo included:

If participants  experience any severe  side effects or related medical issues during their  participation in the study, 
it is important that they  contact [CONTACT_74562]/or the Study Physician (listed on page one) at the telephone 
number provided  as soon as possible . The Study Physician’s  emergency contact [CONTACT_651828].  
 
Thyroid C -Cell Tumors : Liraglutide causes both cancerous and non -cancerous thyroid C -cell tumors in mice and 
rats. The relevance of this finding to humans has not been determined. Individuals with a personal or family history 
of thyroid tumors are not eligible for this study. Participants should tell their primary care provider (PCP) and the 
study staff if they  get a lump  or swelling  in the neck, hoarseness, trouble  swallowing, or shortness of breath  as 
these may be symptoms of thyroid cancer . 
 
Inflammation of the  Pancrea s: Inflammation of the pancreas  (pancreatitis ) has been observed in some patients 
taking  liraglutide. Participants should co ntact their  PCP and the study staff if they  experience severe pain in their  
stomach area (abdomen) that will not go away, with or without vomiting . If pancreatitis is suspected, the 
participant will be instructed to stop taking liraglutide  and will be withdrawn from the study.  
 
Gallbladder Problems : Gallbladder problems, including gallstones, have been reported in some patient s taking 
liraglutide. Participant should contact [CONTACT_651829] 
(abdomen ), fever, yellowing of skin or eyes (jaundice) , or clay -colored stools.  If cholelithiasis (gallstones) or 
cholecystitis (gallbladder inflammation) are suspected, the participant will be instructed to stop taking liraglutide  
and will be withdrawn from the study . 
 
Increased Heart Rate : Liraglutide may i ncrease heart rate  while at rest . During this study, participants ’ heart rate 
will be measured regularly to monitor for any changes.  Participants should contact [CONTACT_651830].  
 
Kidney Problems : Liraglutide may cause nausea, vomiting , or diarrhea leading to loss of fluids (dehydration). 
Dehydration may cause kidney failure which can lead to the need for dialysis. This can happen in people who have 
never ha d kidney problems before. Drinking plenty of fluids may reduce the chance of dehydration. Participants 
should contact [CONTACT_651831], vomiting, or diarrhea  that does not go 
away, or if they  cannot drink liquids by [CONTACT_1966].  
 
Depression or Thoughts of Suicide : Individuals who are at risk for suicide attempts or those with active suicidal 
thought s should not take liraglutide. This is why study staff will ask participants  about these issues during the 
Intake Visit . Parti cipants’  mood will be monitored  throughout this study. Participants  should pay attention to any 
mental changes, especially sudden changes, in their  mood, behaviors, thoughts, or feelings. Participants should 
contact [CONTACT_651832], worse, or worry them . 
Participants who endorse current suicidal thoughts or behaviors will be instructed to stop taking liraglutide and 
will be withdrawn from treatment . 
 
Potential Drug Interactions : Liraglutide  delays stomach emptying and can affect medicines that need to pass 
through the stomach quickly. Taking liraglutide may impact the absorption of some oral medications and how

DAL Protocol v8 [ADDRESS_874859] their PCP and study staff if they feel del ays in stomach emptying , such as 
feeling uncomfortably full after little food is eaten . 
 
Unforeseen Risks : People may have allergic reactions to medications. A severe allergic reaction could be life -
threatening. Examples of an allergic reaction include ras h, difficulty breathing, wheezing, sudden drop in blood 
pressure, fast pulse, sweating, and swelling around the mouth, throat, or eyes. There may be other risks associated 
with liraglutide that have not been identified. If additional risks are identified d uring the study, the study team 
will inform participants . If an allergic reaction or hypersensitivity reaction occurs, the participant will be instructed 
to stop taking liraglutide and seek medical attention. The participant will be withdrawn from treatmen t. 
 
Reproductive Risks (Females Only) : The use of liraglutide may pose risks to pregnancy and an unborn child. 
Therefore, participants  should not become pregnant while they  are in the study. If a participant  are able to 
become pregnant, she will be require d to follow a study -approved method of birth control while participating in 
the study. Adequate birth control in this study is the use of double barrier methods (condom with spermicide or 
diaphragm with spermicide), stable hormonal contraception  (such as oral contraceptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], Depo -Provera 
injection or the contraceptive patch) , intrauterine device (IUD), abstinence, or tubal ligation.  
 
Liraglutide may also have unknown risks for breast -fed babies. Therefore, participants  should not breastfeed while 
you i n the study.  
Although pregnancy testing will be performed during the study, it is possible that the results could be wrong. If a 
participant  does become pregnant while in this study, she will be asked to immediately notify the study team , 
discontinue the s tudy drug/placebo , and consult an obstetrician or maternal -fetal specialist. If a participant  
become s pregnant, we will break the study blind and find out if the participant was  taking the study drug or 
placebo. The Study Physician or Nurse Practitioner will remain in contact [CONTACT_651833]. If the participant was  taking the study drug, t he Study Physician or Nurse Practitioner will 
confirm that she is  consulting with an obstetrician or a maternal -fetal specialist, record any complications, and 
obtain information regarding the overall health of the participant  and the baby. The Study Physician will share this 
information with the University of Pennsylvania Institutional Re view Board and with Novo Nordisk, the company 
that manufactures liraglutide . 
 
Subcutaneous Injection: Risks of subcutaneous injection of the study medication or placebo include pain or 
discomfort, bruising at the puncture site, swelling, feeling faint or l ightheaded, and (rarely) infection.  
 
Withdrawal: Many people who smoke cigarettes have symptoms of withdrawal when they stop smoking. These 
symptoms can occur almost immediately and last for about 7 -10 days. These symptoms can include: sadness and 
mood cha nges, insomnia, anxiety, constipation, decreased heart rate, muscle pain, irritability, craving for nicotine, 
headaches, anger, difficulty concentrating, restlessness and nervousness , and appetite change and weight gain. 
These symptoms are usually low risk . The study staff know how to identify these symptoms and inform you about 
them. Although nicotine replacement therapy may help reduce withdrawal symptoms, we ask that you do not use 
any nicotine -containing products (other than your cigarettes) for the dur ation of the study.  
 
Psychological Distress: Participants  may experience emotio nal distress during assessments  from discussing 
feeli ngs and attitudes about smoking  and/or from learning about the risks of smoking. This happens rarely and , in 
almost all case s, does not last long and is of low intensity. The research staff that work with participants  know 
how to help if participants  have any concerns.  
 
Blood Draws: Blood draws may result in bruising and/or slight bleeding at the needle site or may cause you to  feel 
faint. All of these side effects are rare. Blood will be drawn by a trained professional to reduce the risk of these 
discomforts.

possible to know whether an email you send will be viewed along the way. Additionally, if sent messages are not 
deleted, an email provider may have a folder of everything that is sent. If someone gets access to an email account 
(for exam ple, a family member), they could see old messages. There are many other ways in which emails are not 
secure —these are only selected examples. For these reasons we ask that participants  only use email 
communication for routine matters and never for persona l or confidential messages or questions. If participants  
have questions or concerns that are personal in nature, we suggest participants  contact [CONTACT_651834].  
 
Loss of Confidentiality: As this study involves the use of participants’  identifiab le, personal information, there is 
a chance that a loss of confidentiality could occur. The researchers have procedures in place to lessen the 
possibility of this happening (see  Section 10. Data Management) . 
 
8.2. Potential Study Benefits  
It is not known if the  study medication (liraglutide) will cause any change in smoking behavior. Participants who 
enroll in this study may benefit from the knowledge that they are contributing to the advancement of treatments 
to help people quit smoking. All participants will r eceive smoking cessation counseling which may help them  make 
a successful quit attempt.  
 
8.3. Risk/Benefit Assessment  
There is minimal risk for serious adverse events by [CONTACT_249918]. The treatments and procedures 
used in this study have bee n shown to be relatively safe. Research staff will monitor participants closely 
throughout the study. Thus, the risk to benefit ratio for this project is perceived to be low and justifies its 
implementation.  
 
9. Safety and Adverse Events  
 
9.1. Definitions  
Adverse Event  (AE) means any undesired medical event occurring (including an abnormal laboratory finding, 
symptom or disease temporarily associated with the use of a product) to a subject in a clinical trial, whether or 
not related to the Study Drug.  
 
Serious  Adverse Event  (SAE)  means a serious Adverse Event that at any dose  
1. Results in death;  
2. Is life threatening;  
3. Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_316886];  
4. Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity;  
5. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or  
6. Is an important medical event that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_651790] a “Serious Adverse Even t” when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, such 
event may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above in this definition.  
 
Serious and Unexpected Suspected Adverse Reaction  (S[LOCATION_003]R)  means a Serious Adverse Event which is unexpected 
and regarded as possibly or probably related to the study drug by [CONTACT_1034] -Investigator.  
 
AE Reporting Period  
The study period during which adverse events must be reported is the period from the initiation of any study 
procedures (signing informed consent) to the end of the study treatment follow -up. For this study, the study

Pre-existing Condition  
A pre -existing condition is one that is present at the start o f the study. A preexisting condition will be recorded as 
an adverse event if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the condition worsens during the study period.  
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], Prolonged Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] , or Surgery  
Any adverse event that results  in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_43355] 
a serious adverse event unless specifically instructed otherwise in this protocol. Any condition responsible for 
surgery should be documented as an adverse event if the con dition meets the criteria for and adverse event.  
 
Neither the condition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], nor surgery are reported as an adverse event in 
the following circumstances:  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_651792] a preexisting 
condition. Surgery will not be reported as an outcome of an adverse event if the purpose of the surgery 
was elective or diagnostic and the outcome was uneventful.  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14842].  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14843], unless it is a 
worsening or increase in frequency of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_651793]. 
 
Pregnancy  
Study subjects will be instructed to notify the PI ([CONTACT_329069]) immediately if they become pregnant. [CONTACT_329069] will 
report any pregnancies occurring during the trial to Novo Nordisk using the same guidelines as described for AEs. 
Pregnancy complications will be recorded as AEs. If the infant has a congenital anomaly/birth defect this must be 
reported and followed up as a Serious Adverse Event.  
 
Precautions/Over -dosage  
Effects of overdoses have included severe nausea and severe vomiting. In the event of over -dosage, appropriate 
supportive treatment will be initiated according to the patient’s clinical signs and symptoms.  
 
9.2. Collection and Recording of Adverse Events  
 
9.2.1.  AE Collection Methods  
All AEs and SAEs occurring during the study period will be captured through the measures described below:  
1. Participants will complete a symptoms evaluation/ side effects checklist (SEC) at all study visits from the 
first study -related activity (signing of informed consent). The SEC will assess the severity of side effects 
(defined as AEs) that may be drug related and experienced by [CONTACT_81260] . Items will be rated 
by [CONTACT_249891]: 0 (None=No Concerns), 1 (Mild=Side effect or event 
does not interfere with usua l daily activities), 2 (Moderate=Side effect does interfere with some activities), 
and 3 (Severe=No normal activities are possible).  
 
2. Participants will complete an open -ended SEC form at all in -person study visits  from the first study -related 
activity (sig ning of informed consent). The open -ended SEC  form will assess any symptom, medical issue, 
or concern that may be related to a subject’s participation not included on the SEC. The reporting period 
for each assessment will inquire about any symptom(s)/medic al concern(s) experienced since the last in -
person visit. If a participant reports a symptom(s) or medical concern(s), they will be asked to rate the 
severity of the event utilizing the following severity scale: 0 (None=No Concerns), 1 (Mild=Issue does not  
interfere with usual daily activities), 2 (Moderate=Issue does interfere with some activities), and 3 
(Severe=No normal activities are possible). Follow -up information surrounding the report will be collected 
CONFIDENTIAL

DAL Protocol v8 20200616             Page 29 of 50 as necessary.  
 
3. Once enrolled, participants wil l be instructed to inform (spontaneous assessment) the study staff of any 
notable symptom, medical issue(s), or concern throughout the study. Participants will also receive an 
emergency medical card with the Study Physician’s contact [CONTACT_651835].  
 
4. The current version of US Prescribing Information (i.e., label) or any updates made during the study will 
be used in the assessment of expectedness of an adverse event.  
 
9.2.2.  AE/SAE Documentation and Internal Reporting Procedures  
AE/SAE Documentation : As noted above in section 9.2.1, research staff are trained to collect follow -up information 
about any severe or moderate  AEs reported on the SEC Form, any medical event(s) reported on the Open -Ended 
AE F orm, or any notable spontaneously reported medical event or concern.  At a minimum, follow -up information 
will include AE/SAE onset/resolution, description of event/course, severity, action taken, outcome, and possible 
relation to liraglutide  (if applicabl e). 
 
Information surrounding AEs and SAEs will be initially recorded on the appropriate source document such as the 
SEC Form, Open -Ended AE Form, an “AE Note” or SAE Form, and/or any document in which the AE/SAE 
information was originally recorded. All app licable AEs and SAEs will then be documented on a cumulative AE and 
SAE log maintained within the study database.    
 
Completed documentation of applicable AEs will include the following information:  
 Protocol Title and IRB#  
 Subject Identifier   
 Event Title  
 Date Site Notified  
 Event Start Date  
 Event Stop Date  
 Description of Event/Course (including sequelae)  
 Severity:

o Mild = Side effect or issue does not interfere with usual daily activities  
o Moderate = Side effect or issue interferes with some activities  
o Severe = No normal activities are possible  
 Relatedness to the study procedures (PI [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or Study Physician):  
o Unrelated = Definitely not related   
o Possibly = May be related  
o Probably = Likely related  
o Definitely = Related  
 Expectedness per protocol and/or consent  
o Expected  
o Unexpected

 Relevant Medical History (if a ppropriate)  
 
Internal Reporting Procedures :  All relevant follow -up information outlined above (see AE/SAE documentation) 
concerning applicable AEs, including all information regarding the occurrence of concurrent smoking and 
liraglutide  (if applicable) an d previously reported event(s) and/or side effects, will be reported to the Principal 
Investigator , Study Nurse Practitioner,  and/or Study Physician to determine a course of action (e.g. continue to 
monitor, reduce medication dose, stop medication), relate dness (causality) to the study, and expectedness (if not 
already established). This consult will be documented via email. The clinical course of each event will be followed 
until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been determined that the study tre atment or participation is not (or 
unlikely) to be the cause.  
 
SAEs that are still ongoing at the end of the study period must be followed up to determine the final outcome 
unless it has been determined that the study treatment or participation is not the  cause. Any SAE that occurs after 
the study period and is considered to be possibly related to the study treatment or study participation should be 
recorded and reported immediately per this protocol.  
 
9.3. Reporting of Adverse Events  and Unanticipated Problems  
AE reporting requirements are detailed in the following sub -sections:   
 
9.3.1.  Investigator Reporting: Notifying Novo Nordisk  
The study Sponsor -Investigator is required to report certain study events in an expedited fashion to Novo Nordisk , 
the producer of the medication utilized in this study. The following describes specific events and the corresponding 
reporting requirements:  
 
 Within 7 calendar days  
CONFIDENTIAL  
This material is the property of the University of Pennsylvania . 
DAL Protocol v8 20200616             Page 31 of 50 Any adverse  event that is : 
– associated with the use of the study drug  (probably or definitely related),  
– unexpect ed, 
– fatal or life -threatening  
 
 Within 15 calendar days  
Any adverse  event that is : 
– associated with the use of the study drug  (probably or definitely related) , 
– unexpected and  
– serious, but not fatal or life -threatening  
-or- 
– a previous AE that was not initially deemed reportable but is later found to fit the criteria for reporting 
(reporting within 15 calendar days from when event was deemed reportable).  
Any finding from tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that : 
– suggest s a significant risk for human subjects including reports of mutagenicity, teratogenicity, or 
carcinogenicity.  
 
Findings from other studies that:  
– suggest a significant risk for human subjects exposed to the study drug.  
 
Increased rate of occurrence of serious suspected adverse reactions:  
– any clinically significant increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed 
in this protocol or the drug label . 
 
All serious drug -related adverse events will be reported to the study drug su pplier within 24 hours of learning of 
the event.  The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_651794], if specifically requested by [CONTACT_5257] s upplier.  
 
Novo Nordisk ( Study Drug Supplier ): Reports of all serious drug -related adverse events  shall be made to the study 
drug supplier (Novo Nordisk) at the same time they are reported to regulatory authorities or within [ADDRESS_874861].  
 
If Serious Adverse  Events, pregnancies and/or other events are reported to Novo Nordisk,  the Sponsor -
Investigator shall provide randomization lists with actual  treatment to N ovo Nordisk at the end of the study.  
 
9.3.2.  Investigator Reporting: Notifying the Penn IRB  and the ACC  CTSMRC  
Notifying the Penn I nstitutional Review Board (IRB)  
A reportable event is an adverse event or incident that has the potential to be classified by [CONTACT_651836]. In general, an incident is determined to be a 
reportable event when it is both  
1. unexpected in terms of nature or severity or frequency  
2. probably or definitely related to participation in the research.  
 
If an adverse ev ent that meets these criteria, the IRB requires investigators to submit within [ADDRESS_874862] enough information to complete 
the Reportable Event form within this timeframe, a Reportable Event Form will be submitted and indicate that a 
follow up report will be provided once additional information has been obtained.  
 
Reportable Events include:  
CONFIDENTIAL

DAL Protocol v8 20200616             Page 32 of 50  
(1) ADVERSE MEDICAL EVENTS WHICH ARE BOTH RELATED AND UNEXPECTED:  
 
 An event is considered “related to the research procedures” if the cause of the event is deemed probably 
or definitely related to the investigational  product or a procedure that was performed for the purposes of 
the research.  
 A “suspected adverse reaction” could be considered a reportable event when there is reasonable 
possibility that the drug/investigational product caused the adverse event. For thes e reporting purposes, 
reasonable possibility means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the 
drug/investigational product and the event  
 If the Sponsor determination notes a causal relationship between the event and the investigational 
drug/product without required revisions to the consent form or other study documents and/or the report 
indicates that the event does not alter the risk profile of the investigational drug/product, the event 
should not be classified as reportable  
 An event i s “unexpected” if it is not accurately reflected in the protocol -related documents, such as the 
IRB-approved research protocol, the investigator’s brochure/package insert, or, the current IRB –
approved informed consent document. An event can also be consid ered unexpected if is not listed at the 
specificity or severity that has previously been observed and described in the protocol -related documents.  
 “Unexpected” also refers to events that are mentioned in the investigator’s brochure/package insert as 
occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated, but, are not mentioned as to have been  
 
(2) UNANTICIPATED ADVERSE MEDICAL DEVICE REACTION:  
 
 Any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life -threatening problem or death caused by, or 
associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, 
or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or 
application), or any other unanticipated serious probl em associated with a device that relates to the 
rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.  
 
(3) NON -MEDICAL EVENTS - THE IRB ALSO REQUIRES PROMPT REPORTING OF THE FOLLOWING EVENTS:  
 
 Withdrawal from marketing for safety concerns of a drug, device, or biologic used in a research protocol.  
 Complaint of a participant when the complaint indicates unexpected risks or the complaint cannot be 
resolved by [CONTACT_5051]  
 Breach of confidentiality  
 Incarceration of a participant when the research was not previously app roved under Subpart C and the 
investigator believes it is in the best interest of the subject to remain on the study  
 Premature completion of a study for any reason  
 
All adverse events that are not considered reportable events as defined above will be submi tted to the IRB at the 
time of Continuing Review.  
 
Notifying the Abramson Cancer Center Clinical Trials Scientific Review and Monitoring Committee (ACC CTSRMC)  
All adverse events meeting the following reporting requirements will be entered into the Penn Cl inical Trials 
Management System (PennCTMS) AE/SAE form.  
On-Site subjects

DAL Protocol v8 20200616             Page 33 of 50 treatment/intervention are not reportable unless a longer time frame is specified in the protocol.  
 
Protocol Exception s 
An exception is a  one time, intentional action or process that departs from the IRB and CTSRMC approved study 
protocol, intended for one occurrence. If the action disrupts the study progress, such that the study design or 
outcome (endpoints) may be compromised, or the acti on compromises the safety and welfare of study subjects, 
advance documented IRB and ACC approval is required.  
 
Protocol Deviation s 
A deviation is a one time, unintentional action or process that departs from the IRB and CTSRMC approved study 
protocol, inv olving one incident and identified retrospectively, after the event occurred. If the impact on the 
protocol disrupts the study design, may affect the outcome (endpoints), or compromises the safety and welfare 
of the subjects, the major deviation must be re ported to the ACC and the IRB within 10 business days of discovery.  
 
Minor d eviations that do not meet the definition above will be explained in a memo to file or recorded on a 
deviation log and will contain documentation of the PI’s assessment of the imp act of the deviation on safety and 
study outcomes.  Minor deviations will be reported to the IRB and ACC at the time of Continuing Review.  
9.4. Premature Termination of the Study  
The study will be stopped if any of the following occur:  
 There is clear evidence of  harm or harmful side -effects of the treatment .  
 There is no likelihood of demonstrating treatment benefit.  
 
9.5. Medical Monitoring  
It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_487148]. This 
safety monit oring will include careful assessment and appropriate reporting of AEs/SAEs as noted above, as well 
as adherence to the study data and safety monitoring plan outlined in Sections 9 and 1 1. 
 
10. DATA MANAGEMENT  
The CIRNA Data Management Team has developed a dat a management system (D MS) that will facilitate the 
operational facets of this study, including collection, validation and storage of participant data, tracking 
recruitment call attempts, participant study milestones, and accrual goals, and exporting data f or use in 
statistical analysis and data sharing.  The DMS  integrates Microsoft Access, REDCap and AutoData Scannable 
Office.   
 
REDCap (Rese arch Electronic Data Capture) is  the primary software platform for collecting and storing 
questionnaire data. REDCap  is a web -based application developed by [CONTACT_651837]. It is HIPAA -compliant, and highly secure. REDCap ensures data integrity through range and 
validity checks during the data entry process. In addition to RE DCap, some data will be collected using scannable 
forms created in AutoData Scannable Office.  Scannable Office uses Microsoft Word to create forms that are 
mapped to a MS Access database and processed with an imaging scanner. During the scanning process, 
response data is captured and written directly into the database.  
 
Microsoft Access is a relational database product and  the primary software platform for project management. 
The MS Access d atabases contain VBA programming to automate report generation (e. g., accrual, enrollment, 
medication side effects, participant compliance, and recruitment sources), calculate study milestone dates, 
calculate study compensation, perform range/validity checks as users enter data, generate custom error 
messages to control user input, and populate information displayed on participant study materials.  
 
10.1. Data Management System Development  
The CIRNA Data Manager will work closely with the trial investigators to develop an understanding of the data 
collection, storage, and qualit y assessment needs for the trial. This includes the design and development of the 
trial data collection forms and any additional administrative CRFs, to ensure that standardized, uniform data

DAL Protocol v8 [ADDRESS_874864] plan and is intended to verify the proper functioning 
of all components of the DMS. Any components that do not function as they were intended will be identified and 
evaluated by [CONTACT_487180]. Testing will also include  an 
evaluation by [CONTACT_651838]. Successful completion of these user acceptance tests will mark the end of development and predicate the 
deployment of the DMS for use in  storing and managing active trial data. Any modifications made to the DMS will 
be conducted in accordance with change control procedures.  
 
10.2. Data Security  
Data collected in MS Access and REDCap databases will be stored on a secure server administered by [CONTACT_651839] (PMACS) organization and will be restricted to only those individuals who 
are authorized to work on the trial.  Individual user accounts with passwords will be used to restrict access to the 
database. Specific priv ilege assignments will also be employed  so a user has access only to the functions necessary 
to complete applicable operations  appropriate for their role in the trial . Additional measures to prevent 
unauthorized external access to the database environment will be employed using network firewall technologies. 
The Data Manager will maintain the database in an appropriate manner for the retention period required by 
[CONTACT_5151]. Database administration includes user account maintenance, database security, perfor mance 
monitoring, and database change management.  Daily backups are performed to protect data against accidental 
destruction or corruption.  
 
10.3. Data Processing  
The data entry screens will resemble the data collection forms as closely as possible to allow visu al referencing 
during data entry. This data entry module will be configured for single data entry. The majority of p articipant data 
will be self-report and participants will enter data into REDCap using tablets during in -person visits. Some data 
will be collected by [CONTACT_3647], recorded on study -specific CRFs, and scanned in or entered directly into REDCap 
or MS Access . Data entry checks will be included in the entry screen designs where appropriate to limit the 
opportunity for erroneous entries due t o mistypi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. Such data entry checks would include value range 
comparisons, valid data type checks, required value checks, and /or skip pattern enforcement. Following initial  
eligibility screening, research staff will perform subject registration.   
 
10.4. Data Qua lity Assurance  
Data quality module s will be developed by [CONTACT_651840] .  The module s will run automatically to inspect all newly 
entered or modifie d data. The research staff will review the results of the data validation and take any required 
corrective action for invalid data. Corrections identified for individual data items will be managed by [CONTACT_237766]. All changes made will be recorded in  an electronic audit trail and documented using change control 
procedures.

database. Any errors will be investigated, resolved , and a plan will be implemented to prevent further errors  
should concerning patterns emerge . 
 
10.5. Subject and Specimen Tracking  
The Data Manager will develop a module to assist research staff in recruitment an d retention tracking for trial 
participant s. This module will accept and store contact [CONTACT_651841] s and will include data 
items to indicate the completion status of significant events. The tracking module will include information about 
contact [CONTACT_651842] t in preparing communications to potential subjects and trial participants 
concerning scheduled events. The module will also allow for incentive -related inventory management. When 
obtaining  blood and  saliva specimens, the research staff will complete a spe cimen registration CRF and scan/enter 
the data into the DMS. A unique specimen identifier will be assigned and recorded on the CRF. Labeled specimens 
and applicable information will be transferred to the lab as required for analysis.  
 
 
10.6. Data Handling and R ecord Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]  
 
10.6.1.  Confidentiality  
Information about study participants  will be kept confidential and managed according to the requirements of the 
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).  Those regulations require a signed subject 
authorization informing the subject of the following:  
 What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study  
 Who will have access to that information and why  
 Who will use or disclose that information  
 The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI.  
 
In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by [CONTACT_5151], retains the 
ability to use all information collected prior to t he revocation of subject authorization.  For subjects that have 
revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts should be made to obtain permission to collect at least 
vital status (i.e. that the subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled study period.  
 
Confidentially of study data will be maintained in  the following manner:  
 Paper -based records will be kept in a secure location and only be accessible to personnel involved in the 
study.  
 Computer -based files will only be made available to personnel  involved in the study through the use of 
access privileges and passwords.  
 Prior to access to any study -related information, personnel will be required to review and sign statements 
agreeing to protect the security and confidentiality of identifiable infor mation.  
 Whenever feasible, identifiers will be removed from study -related information.  
 Precautions are in place to ensure the data is secure by [CONTACT_71994], because the 
research involves web -based surveys.  
 Audio recordings will be reviewed by [CONTACT_079]  [INVESTIGATOR_651795].  
 Remote study sessions will be conducted via phone or via BlueJeans, which is a HIPAA -compliant platform 
with  security features including a room lock to ensure that communications within the platform remain 
private.

DAL Protocol v8 [ADDRESS_874866]’s study identif ication number. A linked subject identification table 
is created to store subject name, address, and telephone contact [CONTACT_3031]. This table uses the automatically 
generated index number rather than the study identification number. The master subject map  and subject 
identification information are maintained in separate locations. Using this method, no identifying subject 
information is directly linked to bio -samples or results.  Any publication of data will not identify participants by 
[CONTACT_651843].  
 
All biological samples will be labeled with study ID only.  All participant  data that can be linked to the study ID will 
be stored in the secure Data Management System, which has limited, password -required acc ess. The 
aforementioned precautions and procedures will be applied to protecting subject privacy and the protected health 
information detailed in Section 10.6.[ADDRESS_874867] Privacy & Protected Health Information  
The following protected health information (PHI) may be collected as part of this study:  
 Name, address, telephone number, email address  
 Date of birth  
 Social Security Number (W -9 form)  
 Medical Record Number  
 Some personal information that may be considered sensitive, such as medical histo ry, psychological 
history, alcohol use history, etc.  
 Results from physical examinations, questionnaires, or procedures as outlined in this protocol  
 
Potential participants will be contact[CONTACT_651844]. Only individuals who have responded to recruitment efforts or who have 
agreed to be contact[CONTACT_250067]. If an individual cannot be 
reached immediately, staff membe rs will identify themselves only as calling from the University of Pennsylvania; 
no mention will be made of the inquiry regarding study participation. Participants will undergo an initial telephone 
screening where preliminary eligibility for the research s tudy will be determined. Only if a participant is initially 
eligible, will they be asked to attend an in -person Intake Visit to confirm eligibility. All data collected over the 
phone , BlueJeans,  and during in -person visits will be collected by [CONTACT_651845] -
Protection of Human Subjects Research Training as well as HIPAA Compliance Training. Once enrolled, information 
will never be recorded with identifiers other than study ID. A separate list of names with ID numbers will be 
accessible only by [CONTACT_4144]. All records will be kept in locked filing cabinets to maintain 
confidentiality. All analyses will be conducted on de -identified data.   
 
Data will be accessible only to the Study Investigators, Study Physician, study staff, applicable Center staff, UPenn

11. DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING  
 
11.1. Research Roles  
During the course of the study, data and safety monitoring will be performed on an ongoing basis by [CONTACT_651846] . 
DAL Protocol v8 [ADDRESS_874868] for the data on the case report 
forms (CRFs), ensuring all  fields are completed appropriately, and all error corrections are done according to GCPs. 
Any inconsistencies/deviations will be documented  and addressed as appropriate . The research  staff will perform 
regular chart reviews to verify data integrity. The Project Manager  (or senior personnel) and Principal I nvestigator 
will maintain the study regulatory binder/essential documents  per GCP . The Study Physician /Nurse Practitioner  
will be available to review medical issues related to participation for each part icipant on an ongoing basis as 
outlined in this protocol. Research staff will meet and communicate on a regular basis to reconcile data queries 
and safety concerns. The IRB will review the trial on an on -going basis per institutional and federal regulation s 
until the study is formally closed -out. 
 
11.2. Staff Training  
Staff training will consist of an initial explanation and review of the protocol, informed consent form, CRFs and 
laboratory  tasks, sample collection protocols, data management system, adverse event  collection and reporting, 
and all study -specific SOPs. In addition, during a standardized training period, the duties of each staff member will 
be clearly outlined and all applicable regulations will be reviewed. The P rincipal Investigator , [CONTACT_651858] hare , 
will oversee the smoking cessation  counseling training . Training interactions will be documented in a training log, 
which will be maintained within the  electronic  regulatory binder. Senior personnel will supervise junior staff and 
provide re -training  as needed.   
 
All personnel working on this project will complete required training  in the protection of human subjects and the 
protection of personal identifiable information (i.e. HIPAA) and Good Clinical Practices before interacting with 
study data or research participants.  All human subject and privacy protections certifications will be maintained in 
the electronic regulatory binder.  
 
11.3. Monitoring Activities  
 
11.3.1.  AE/SAE Monitoring  
Monitoring and management of AEs/SAEs w ill be conducted in real -time by [CONTACT_079], Study 
Physician,  Nurse Practitioner,  and the research team at regular time points as per the methods and procedures 
detailed in Section 9: Safety and Adverse Events.  
 
11.3.2.  Initial Assessment (Intake) Monitoring  
The study staff will conduct a manual review of source documents for all subjects determined to be eligible at pre-
screen ing prior to the Intake Visit. Eligibility data will be reviewed in real -time at the Intake Visit by [CONTACT_237766]. Once all eligibility data has been collected, the Study Physician will review participant s’ eligibility and medical 
information to determine approval for the distribution of  study medication. This determination will be 
documented via  signature [CONTACT_651854] ’ study chart s. Once 
distribution of study medication is approved, the Study Physician or Study Nurse Practitioner will sign a study 
medication prescription blank that will be  sent to Investigational Drug Services.  
 
11.3.3.  Protocol Monitoring  
 
Protocol monitoring includes a survey of those activities that are associated with protocol adherence such as 
identifying, reporting, and rectifying protocols deviations, reviewing for violations of  inclusion/exclusion criteria, 
and ensuring the adherence to study -specific SOPs, GCP, and other federal and institutional regulations. 
Protocol monitoring will be performed on an ongoing basis through the following methods:  
1. Checklists will be utilized at all time points to ensure all data is collected per protocol and procedures are 
followed as appropriate.  
2. A Final Eligibility Checklist will be completed after the Intake Visit for all participants who enroll (i.e. sign 
consent) in the study. The Final Elig ibility Checklist will serve as final confirmation of eligibility status prior to 
seeking approval for distribution of study medication from the Study Physician.

DAL Protocol v8 20200616             Page 38 of 50 3. An internal chart review procedure will be completed for ~25% of randomly selected eligible subjects. The 
chart review procedure is a thorough review of all source documentation to ensure the integrity of the data, 
all study paperwork is present, all fields are completed per GCP, and all study -specific SOPs have been 
followed appropriately.  
11.3.4.  Data base Auditing  
As outlined in Section 10: Data Management , the study DMS will be equipped with internal validation checks to 
ensure data is entered within reasonable ranges. Error messages will be displayed in real -time if data appears 
inaccurate. Staff wil l have to respond to these error messages before data can be saved. In addition, The Project 
Manager/ Study Coordinator  (or senior personnel)  will perform regular milestone quality assurance checks.  
 
11.3.5.  Data Security  
As outlined in Section 10: Data Management , study data will be secured through controlled user access and 
accessible to authorized personnel only.   Source documents will be secured in locked filing cabinets.  
 
11.4. Frequency of Data and Safety Monitoring  
Data will be reviewed internally on a regular ba sis. Specifically:  
1. At data capture, the research staff will review data for completeness and integrity.  
2. At data entry, the DMS  will include multiple internal validity checks which will prompt the staff if an entry 
was made that is out of range or in an unacceptable format.  
3. Eligibility data will be reviewed in real -time at the Intake Visit. In addition, t he Principal 
Investigator/Project Manager  (or senior personnel) will review and verify that all data have been collected 
and, when applicable, meets the eligibility criteria on a “Final Eligibility C hecklist.”  
4. Between the Intake Visit and distribution of study medication (Lab Visit 1) , the Study Physician will receive 
confirmation from the study staff  that a participant has met all the eligibility criteri a via email. Any 
additional eligibility queries will be addressed at this time as well. No study medication  will be distributed 
without documented approval of the Study Physician  via email . 
5. On a regular basis, the project staff will review data through an internal chart review procedure supported 
by [CONTACT_249931] .  A random subset of  eligible participants (~25% ) will be reviewed.  
6. All CRFs for eligible subjects are 100% source -data verified through an internal data management system 
(Data Entry/Quality Assurance) on an ongoing basis.   
7. The study statistician will review data prior to analysis to ensure integrity and validity.

12.1. Informed Consent  
A fu lly trained study staff member will obtain informed consent using the combined consent and HIPAA form 
approved by [CONTACT_651849]. This process will take place before study data are collected and prior to any treatment. 
The consenting process may occur remote ly or in -person as part of the Intake session. If completed remotely, 
subjects will be contact[CONTACT_626174] (HIPAA -compliant) for a videoconference or by [CONTACT_648]. Reviewing the 
consent form will be completed using a REDCap survey and a PowerPoint visual.  Staff will email or text the survey 
link to subjects. Whether in person or remote, staff will review the study description, and all study procedures, 
potential risks, and information about the study medication will be addressed. Subjects will be given the  
opportunity to read the consent form in full. Following this, subject questions will be answered, and staff will 
administer comprehension questions to ensure subject understanding. Any incorrect answers will be addressed 
by [CONTACT_651850]. If remote, subjects will indicate within the REDCap survey if they wish 
to participate and will then be prompted to enter their First and Last name [CONTACT_651855]. Subjects who are unable to provide an electronic signat ure may be mailed a physical version of the consent 
that must be mailed back to us prior to continuing with the Intake tasks. If needed, staff may also ask subjects to 
sign a physical version of the form at their first in -person visit for record keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. S ubjects will be able to download 
their signed version of the form from REDCap, and staff will also download a version to be saved to the electronic 
regulatory binder on our secure server, or, printed and placed in our physical binder. If in -person, subject s will 
receive a physical copy of the combined consent and HIPAA form for their records. Subjects will also be given the 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_9769]’s contact [CONTACT_651851]. The consent process will take place in English, there will 
be no waiting period, no coercion to participate, and all subjects will be considered competent to provide 
informed consent (i.e., they will be asked if they under stand what they are consenting for).

ABSTRACT  Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS) is considered the gold standard for treatment of high-risk non-melanoma skin cancer. Postoperative bleeding is a complication that can lead to further complications including necrosis, infections, take-down of repairs, patient distress and unnecessary return visits including possibly to emergency rooms after hours. Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic drug that prevents the breakdown of blood clots. The topi[INVESTIGATOR_374137], plastic, and maxillofacial surgeries.  It has also been used topi[INVESTIGATOR_178106] a hemostatic agent in anterior epi[INVESTIGATOR_374138]. This study aims to determine the efficacy of topi[INVESTIGATOR_374139].  2. OBJECTIVES  To perform a prospective randomized controlled trial to determine the hemostatic effect of TXA soaked gauze (intervention) versus normal saline soaked gauze (control) when applied to granulating defects in the setting of Mohs micrographic surgery by [CONTACT_374155]: 1. Rate of postoperative hemorrhagic complications. 2. Types of postoperative hemorrhagic complications.  3. BACKGROUND AND SIGNICANCE  Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS) is considered the gold standard for treatment of high-risk non-melanoma skin cancer.[ADDRESS_468465] preventative measure utilized in wound care to decrease risk of postoperative hemorrhage.5  Antifibrinolytics decrease bleeding by [CONTACT_374156]. Several different pharmaceutical formulations are available, including tranexamic acid (TXA). TXA is a synthetic lysine analogue that blocks binding sites of plasminogen to lysine, thus preventing plasminogen activation to plasmin and the subsequent enzymatic lysis of polymerized fibrin in blood clots.6 TXA can be administered intravenously, orally, subcutaneously, or topi[INVESTIGATOR_897], for the reduction of bleeding.

The topi[INVESTIGATOR_374140]12, orthopedic13, plastic14, and maxillofacial15 surgeries, as well as for anterior epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940].16 A recent meta-analysis of 71 RTCs, mostly in the setting of orthopedic surgery, showed that topi[INVESTIGATOR_374141] 70%.17 Systemic absorption and cytotoxicity to ex vivo skin is negligible under concentrations of 25mg/ml.18,19 There is no increased risk of thromboembolic events or myocardial infarction when TXA is applied topi[INVESTIGATOR_897].17 To our knowledge, there has been no study in which topi[INVESTIGATOR_374142].  4. STUDY PROCEDURES  A. Study design I. Prospective randomized controlled trial II. Location:  University of Missouri Columbia Dermatologic Surgery Unit (Columbia, MO) III. Patients:  All adult (18 years or older) patients presenting for Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS) for the treatment of melanoma or nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) with a wound that will be healing by [CONTACT_374157]. Patients meeting inclusion criteria will be randomized into two arms once enrolled in the study and will be randomized using computerized randomization software. The study personnel will randomize patients on the day of surgery.  a. One arm will serve as the control group and will receive normal saline soaked telfa pads to the wound bed upon completion of MMS.   b. A second arm will receive TXA 25mg/ml soaked telfa pads to wound bed upon completion of MMS. This concentration is based on studies showing possible decrease in re-epi[INVESTIGATOR_374143], as well as decreased viability of bovine and human cartilage, above this selected concentration.19-21 V. Both solutions of the intervention and control are clear liquids that cannot be differentiated from one another. As such, the research staff will provide the surgeon with an unmarked sample cup of the either the saline solution or TXA solution, as selected by [CONTACT_374158]. This will ensure that the surgeon, fellow, nursing staff, patient and family of patient are blinded to the intervention.  
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_368370], MD  IRB# 2025444 		V3; 5/20/21 VI. TXA will be provided by [CONTACT_374159]-site/in-clinic in a temperature controlled and temperature monitored refrigerator. The volume of TXA solution needed for the intervention, see below, will be diluted to 25mg/ml by [CONTACT_374160]. VII. Volume of both intervention and control substance will be determined by [CONTACT_374161]. All	defects	will	be	considered	circles	for	the	purposes	of	calculating	wound	area.		The	radius	of	the	greatest	dimension	of	the	defect	will	be	used	to	calculate	the	surface	area	using	the	formula,	𝐴=𝜋𝑟!. A volume of 1ml per 1cm2 will be dropped onto a Telfa pad that has been placed on the wound bed. A standard pressure dressing will be applied overtop. VIII. All patients will receive the same standardized post-operative wound care management instructions (see Appendix I) IX. Post-operative bleeding complications will be determined using the following data points (see Appendix II): a. Did patient call with concern for post-operative bleeding on the same day of surgery, or post-operative day 0 (POD0)? YES/NO b. Did patient call with concern for post-operative bleeding on POD1? YES/NO c. Did patient call with concern for post-operative bleeding on POD2? YES/ NO d. Did patient return to clinic within post-operative days 0-[ADDRESS_468467]-operative bleeding complication? YES/ NO e. Did patient receive postoperative intervention of any kind for hemorrhagic complication? YES/NO f. Type of intervention performed for bleeding complication.  g. Perceived side-effects, if any, by [CONTACT_374162]. X. Study patients will be called 3 days after their surgical procedure to be asked the above data points in case a patient received outside care that was not disclosed to office or research staff. XI. Patients’ medical charts will be reviewed for and patients will also be asked to divulge the following medical history for demographic and sub analysis purposes (see AppendixIII): a. Age, sex, race b. Medical history including hypertension, coronary vascular disease, liver disease, renal disease c. Medications including anti-platelet agents and anti-coagulants B. Study duration and number of study visits required of research participants. I. Duration sufficient to enroll 124 patients (62 per treatment arm).  No additional patient visits will be required beyond the visit normally required for their procedure and/or suture removal. II. The initial visit for this study will take place after already scheduled Mohs micrographic surgery which will take no longer than one additional hour during the surgical visit. 
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_368370], MD  IRB# 2025444 		V3; 5/20/[ADDRESS_468468] current therapy stopped. I. Care will be identical in both arms except for addition of topi[INVESTIGATOR_374144].  E. Justification for inclusion of a placebo or non-treatment group. I. There will be a control group of patients who do not receive the intervention, topi[INVESTIGATOR_374145], and instead will receive topi[INVESTIGATOR_374146] a blinded comparison to the intervention arm. This will prevent unconscious bias from affecting patient and surgeon perception of postoperative bleeding complications. F. Definition of treatment failure or participant removal criteria. I. Patient will be removed from the study if  i. Patient removes bandage and cleans wound within 24hrs ii. Patient seeks postoperative care from outside institution within study timeframe (POD0-2), thus not allowing researchers to evaluate postoperative complication. This will be elucidated with a phone call three days after surgery. II. Patients may also voluntarily leave the study. Only patients who complete all steps of the study will be included in data analysis, but the number of enrollees who do not complete the study will be tabulated to track if there is a significant difference between the groups. G. Description of what happens to participants receiving therapy when study ends or if a participant’s participation in the study ends prematurely. I. There will be no effect on the patient.  5. INCLUSION/ EXCLUSION CRITERIA  A. Adult (18 years or older) patients being treated with Mohs micrographic surgery will be included in this study. B. Surgical procedure must include one of the following: a. Any defect being healed by [CONTACT_374163]  i. Including periocular defects22 ii. Including defects with fenestrated cartilage20,[ADDRESS_468469] not 
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_368370], MD  IRB# 2025444 		V3; 5/20/[ADDRESS_468470]-menopausal women or women with history of tubal ligation, ablative uterine procedure or salpi[INVESTIGATOR_8936]/oophor/hyster-ectomy b. Have a known allergic reaction or sensitivity to TXA c. Have an international normalized ratio (INR) out of therapeutic range if on warfarin; all patients on warfarin will be tested within one week of surgery i. INR level will be obtained within 1 week prior to time of intervention ii. therapeutic range INR 2.0-3.0 iii. if high-risk prosthetic heart valve, therapeutic range INR 2.5 – 3.5 6. DRUGS/ SUBSTANCES/ DEVICES A. Active intervention group: application of TXA soaked gauze on open wound defect, held in place by [CONTACT_374164] B. Control group: Identically placed sterile normal saline soaked gauze, held in place by [CONTACT_374164] 7. STUDY STATISTICS A. Primary outcome variable.  I. Determination of effects of topi[INVESTIGATOR_374147] 2 days following Mohs surgery with a wound allowed to heal by [CONTACT_374163] B. Secondary outcome variables. I. Determination of possible adverse effects, if any, that are different between the intervention and control arms. C. Statistical plan including sample size justification and interim data analysis I. The statistical analysis will be performed by [CONTACT_374165].  The sample size was calculated using a power analysis with the alpha set to 0.05 and the power set to 80%.  Dichotomous variables were assessed with an anticipated change of bleeding of 10% in the intervention group and 30% in the control group based on prior clinical experience.  No interim data analysis is planned.  II. Data will be analyzed on an intention to treat basis.   D. Early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004]. I. Study will end early if severe or high rate of adverse events occur.  8. RISKS A. Medical risks, listing all procedures, their major and minor risks and expected frequency.

PHASE:  
3 
INDICATION:  
Treatment of scabies  
OBJECTIVES:  
The primary objective is to assess  the safety and efficacy of topi[INVESTIGATOR_106000]™ (spi[INVESTIGATOR_105999]) versus 
Placebo for the complete  cure of scabies after  a single treatment.  
The s econdary objective will assess pharmacokinetics (PK) of spi[INVESTIGATOR_106001] a 
single dose of Natroba™ in pediatric subjects 4 -16 years of age .  These subjects will be a separate 
population of pediatric subjects . 
ENDPOINTS:  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of “index” subjects completely  cured of scabies by [CONTACT_2006] 
28. The “index” subject is defined as the youngest infested household member (≥4 years). Complete 
cure is defined as demonstration of both clinical cure (all signs and symptoms have completely 
resolved, including burrows, inflammatory /non-inflammatory lesions and prurit us) and microscopic or 
dermatoscopic  cure demonstratin g the absence of mites, eggs, and/or scybala, and negative  
dermatoscopy  for burrows.  
The s econdary endpoint  include s assessing  the PK parameters (C max, Tmax and AUC 0-12h) of spi[INVESTIGATOR_105999] 
(Spi[INVESTIGATOR_106002] n A and Spi[INVESTIGATOR_106003] D) and benzyl alcohol pre-dose and during [ADDRESS_117708] -dose of Natroba™  
in pediatric  subjects (ages 4 -16 years) .  
Safety endpoint s include  the evaluation of adverse events , general skin and eye irritation,  clinical 
laboratory assessments , vital signs, and use of prior and concomitant medications . 
POPULATION:  
Approximately 384 subjects  will be enrolled in the study. The approximate 384 total is based on:  
120 households, each with an “index ” subject  and approximately 2 additional subjects per household 
(infested or not) for 360 total, and 24 additional pediatric subjects with confirmed scabies infestation 
from “non -index” households  for PK analysis . The 120 “index ” subjects with confirmed scabies 
infestati on will comprise the primary efficacy population in order to achieve , with attrition, 48 subjects 
completed  per trea tment group (Natroba™ versus P lacebo) . In this study, “index” subjects will be 
defined as the youngest infested household member (≥4 years).  All household members  of the “ index ” 
subject  will be  randomized to the same treatment.  The pediatric subjects  who comprise the PK 
population will be 12 male or female subjects 4 – 9 years of age (with a minimum of 6 male or female 
subjects 4 – 6 years of age) and 12 male or female subjects 10 – 16 years of age.  I

ParaPRO, LLC  Confidential  STUDY DESIGN AND DURATION:  
The primary study is a double blind, two -arm, 28 -day, placebo -controlled study with approximately 
120 infested “index” subjects randomized 1:1 to Natroba™ or Placebo. All members of a household 
(no more than 6 individuals) with a suspected “index”  subject must be screened at the first visit. In this 
study, “index” subjects are defined as the youngest infested household member (≥4 years). If the 
members have an active sc abies infestation and meet all other criteria,  they must agree to participate in 
the study. Household members who do not present with scabies at the screening visit must also agree to 
apply the same blinded investigational product  (IP) as household members  who present with scabies 
(see Table 6-1 Schedule of Procedures for status assessment). All household members must agree to 
participate in the study or none will be enrolled. Screening procedures include informed consent, 
medication and medical history, urine pregnancy test for females of childbe aring potential, scabies 
assessment  (visual evidence of burrows , inflammatory/non -inflammatory lesions and pruritus),  
microscopic exam ination of skin scrapi[INVESTIGATOR_007],  or dermatoscopy , to demonstrate the presence of mites, 
eggs, and/or scybala (dermatoscopy must c onfirm burrows), vital signs, general skin and eye 
assessment, randomization, CBC and serum chemistry, and IP dispensing and instruction.  
After screening on Day 1, all randomized subjects  in the primary population  will be dispensed IP  
(Natroba™  or Placebo)  to apply  at home  later the same day  as a single treatment over the entire body 
from the neck down to the toes (including  the soles of the feet ) and to the scalp (if balding) or hairline, 
temples and forehead on the same day. Subjects less than [ADDRESS_117709] 1 hour prior to Day 2 visit.  
A separate population  of 24 pediatric “non -index” subjects  that do not reside in the “index” subject’s 
household will be enrolled  to assess the PK o f spi[INVESTIGATOR_106004] 12 hours after open -
label topi[INVESTIGATOR_106005] a single in -clinic visit ( Day 1 , or Day 2 if screening only on Day 1 ). There 
will be 12 male or female subjects 4 – 9 years of age (with a minimum of 6 male or female subjects 4 – 
6 years of age) and 12 male or female subj ects 10 – 16 years of age.  With assistance from a caregiver, 
Natroba™  will be applied over entire body from the neck down  to the toes  (including the soles of the 
feet) and to the hairline, temples, and forehead . The open -label product will remain on the sk in for at 
least [ADDRESS_117710] occur after the 6 
hour blood draw but prior to the 12 hour blood draw.  A ±[ADDRESS_117711]-treatment blood samples. Safety will be assessed  with adverse events (AEs), general skin and eye 
irritation assessments , pre-dose and pre -discharge laboratory evaluations, and vital signs during the 12 
hours in -clinic. Following the sample collections subjects will be released from the clinic  and directed 
to their primary care physician for fo llow-up. PK subjects will be provided 5% Permethrin upon 
discharge to dispense to household members.   
In the primary population  (all household members) , on Day 2  (Visit 2) , general skin and eye 
assessments will be made for possible irritation, and to confirm that all IP was left on for a minimum of 
[ADDRESS_117712] reports an  adverse event assessed as related by [CONTACT_978]

Page 7 of 66 
ParaPRO, LLC  Confidential  On Day 28  (Visit 3) , all household members  will return to the clinic for safety and efficacy 
assessments . The  primary endpoint of complete  cure will be assessed in the infested household 
members . If the infested subject is c ompletely  cured at Day 28, he or she will have completed the study 
and termination procedures will be conducted.  If the subje ct is not c ompletely  cured at Day 28 (with 
Natroba™ or P lacebo), the subject will receive 5% Permethrin  and will be directed to their primary 
care physician for follow -up. 
Safety assessments will be made for all household members and will include monitorin g of adverse 
events (A Es) throughout the study, vital signs recording (Days 1 and 28), clinical laboratory analyses 
(Days 1 and 28), and general skin and eye irritation assessments (Days 1, 2, and 28).  
The Day 28 procedures will also be completed for early  termination (ET) except subjects will not 
receive rescue Permethrin , but will be directed to follow -up with their primary care physician.  
The trial design is presented in the Study Flow Diagram ( Figure 3-1) and the visit assessments are 
described in the Schedule of Procedures ( Table 6-1).

DOSAGE FORMS AND ROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION:  
Natroba™ or P lacebo applied in a single topi[INVESTIGATOR_106007] (including the  soles of the feet ) and to the scalp (if balding) and/or hairline, temples, and 
forehead.  
EFFICACY VARIABLES:  
The primary e fficacy assessment  is the  proportion of index subjects completely cured of scabies by 
[CONTACT_2006] 28.  Complete cure is defined as demonstration of clinical cure (all signs and symptoms have 
completely resolved, including burrows, inflammatory/non -inflammatory lesions and pruritu s) and 
microscopic or dermatoscopic  cure demonstratin g the absence of mites, eggs, and/or scybala, and 
negative  dermatoscopy  for burrows.  
 The s econdary efficacy assessment  include s assessing the PK parameters (C max, Tmax and AUC 0-12h) of 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_105999] (Spi[INVESTIGATOR_106003] A and Spi[INVESTIGATOR_106003] D) and benzyl alcohol pre -dose and during [ADDRESS_117716] -dose of 
Natroba™ in pediatric subjects (ages 4 -16 years).  
 
PHA RMACOKINETIC VARIABLES:  
A blood draw will be taken from subjects in the PK population just before spi[INVESTIGATOR_106008] (t=0) 
and then at 0.5, 1.0, 3.0, 6.0 and 12 hours . The following PK parameters  will be calculated for spi[INVESTIGATOR_105999]  
(Spi[INVESTIGATOR_106003] A and Spi[INVESTIGATOR_106003] D ) and benzyl alcohol  in each subject : Cmax, Tmax, and AUC 0-12h. 
SAFETY ASSESSMENTS:  
In the primary population, s afety assessments include monitoring of A Es on study  Days 1, 2, 14 (phone 
call) and 28 , general skin and eye irritation assessments  on Days 1, 2 and 28, vital signs  on Days 1 and 
28, laboratory assessments  on Days 1 and 28, prior medications on Day 1 and concomitant medications  
on Days 2 and Day 28. For early termination (ET), t he Day [ADDRESS_117717] -dose prior to discharge.   
STATISTICAL ANALYSES:  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of index subjects completely  cured of scabies by [CONTACT_2006] 
28. The primary analysis set will be the “index” intent -to-treat ( I-ITT) population  which is defined as 
all randomized index subjects regardless of whether  they have had any post -baseline assessments and 
the primary efficacy endpoint will be  the proportion of index subjects completely  cured  of scabies by 
[CONTACT_2006] 28 . The number and percentage of index subjects who exhibit complete cure (Yes or No) by [CONTACT_2006]

Page 9 of 66 
ParaPRO, LLC  Confidential  by [CONTACT_3885] (possibly pooled) will be used to compare the complete cure rates between the two 
treatment groups.   The primary analysis will be performed at a si gnificance level of 0.05.  
In the PK population, t he parameters Cmax, Tmax and AUC 0-12h will be used to assess  the absorption  over 
[ADDRESS_117719] -administration in 24 subjects (4 -16 years) . The PK  parameter estimates will be computed 
with noncompartmental methods for each subject. Individual elapsed sampling times (actual time) will 
be used in the PK analysis  and parameters will be computed for each subject.  Descriptive summaries of 
the plasma conc entration levels for both spi[INVESTIGATOR_105999]  (Spi[INVESTIGATOR_106003] A and Spi[INVESTIGATOR_106003] D)  and benzyl alcohol 
observed at each nominal time point will be provided. Descriptive summaries of the PK parameter 
estimates will also be completed. Summary statistics for continuous variables will include number of 
non-missing observations , mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation (CV%), median, 
minimum, and maximum, geometric mean and standard error of the geometric mean.  
The safety endpoint s include  the evaluation of adverse events , general skin and eye irritation 
assessments , clinical laboratory assessments , vital signs, and use of prior and concomitant medications.  
Additionally, the  descriptive  changes from baseline  (pre-dose)  to final assessment (Day 28 in primary 
population and pre -discharge in PK population) will be calculated for applicable  parameter s. 
SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION : 
For the primary efficacy analysis, approximately 120 “index” subjects will be enrolled (including 
possible 20% attrition) from 120 households and randomized 1:1 to each of Natroba™ (spi[INVESTIGATOR_105999]) and 
Placebo control. The index subject will be the youngest infested member of a household (≥4 years). 
Referencing to the Sponsor’s Proof of Concept (POC) study (S PN-401-12) and published literature,5-10 
out of 60 completed subjects, the cure rate is 70% for Natroba™ and 30% for Placebo control.  Based 
upon a reasonable assumption of 60% cure rate for Natroba™ and 30% for placebo, a sample size of 48 
study -completed “index” subjects per group will provi de 80% power to declare the non -equivalency 
using a delta of 30% and Type I error rat e of 0.05.   Fisher exact test was used to calculate the sample 
size and the specified power in the following Table 8 -1 (PASS 14; 2015, NCSS, LLC., Kaysville, Utah, 
[LOCATION_003]. www.ncss.com ). 
 
For the pediatric PK analysis , a sample size of an additional 24 subjects will be enrolled and is based 
on the previous PK studies performed on children 6 months to 4 years of age with head lice infestations 
in which Natroba™ was administered as a single open -label topi[INVESTIGATOR_106009] a 12 -hour period.3 In the current study, 24 male and female subjects (4 -16 years of age) 
with scabies infestation will be enrolled: 12 male or female subjects 4 – 9 years of age (with a 
minimum of 6 male or female subjects 4 – 6 years of age) and 12 male  or female subjects 10 – 16 years 
of age.  No formal power calculations were performed for the PK sample size . 
SITES:  
This study will be conducted at approximately 5-10 sites in the [LOCATION_002].

ParaPRO, LLC  Confidential  1 BACKGROUND  AND  RATIONALE  
1.1 Background  
Human scabies is caused by [CONTACT_106072] (Sarcoptes scabiei 
var. hominis). The microscopic scabies mite burrows into the upper layer of the skin where it 
lives and lays its eggs. The most common symptoms of scabies are intense itching an d a pi[INVESTIGATOR_45886] -
like skin rash. The itching and rash each may affect much of the body or be limited to common 
sites such as the wrist, elbow, armpit, webbing between the fingers, nipple, penis, waist, belt -
line, and buttocks. The rash also can include tiny blis ters (vesicles) and scales. Scratching the 
rash can cause skin sores; sometimes these sores become infected by [CONTACT_50904]. Tiny burrows 
sometim es are seen on the skin  which  are caused by [CONTACT_106073].  These burrows appear as tiny raised and crooked (serpi[INVESTIGATOR_106013]) 
grayish -white or skin - colored lines on the skin surface. Mites are often few in number s (only 10 -
15 mites per person)  and the burrows may be difficult to find. The  burrows  are found most often  
in the webbing between the fingers, in the skin folds on the wrist, elbow, or knee, and on the 
penis, breast, or shoulder blades. The head, face, neck, palms, and soles often are involved in 
infants and very young children, but usually not adults and olde r children.1,[ADDRESS_117735] is frequent. Institutions such as 
nursing homes, extended -care facilities, and prisons are often sites of scabies outbreaks.  Current 
treatment recommended by [CONTACT_106074] (CDC) is a single overnight topi[INVESTIGATOR_106014] 5% Permethrin .1 
Natroba™  (spi[INVESTIGATOR_105999]) Topi[INVESTIGATOR_49182], 0.9% has been approved by [CONTACT_39261] d and Drug 
Administration for the treatment of head lice in patients 6 months of age and older .3 Spi[INVESTIGATOR_106015] a soil  actinimycete bacterium, and acts by [CONTACT_106075]. After periods of hyperexcitation, the lice become paralyzed and die. This 
same mode of action applies to the scabies mite. After topi[INVESTIGATOR_106016] , spi[INVESTIGATOR_106017]. Preclinical testing for 
carcinogenesis, mutagenesis and impairment of fertility were negative. Clinical studies with 
subjects infested with head lice showed  Natroba™  (spi[INVESTIGATOR_105999]) Topi[INVESTIGATOR_106018], 0.9% to be 
more effective than Permethrin  14 days after treatment .3

ParaPRO, LLC  Confidential  1.2 Rationale  
ParaPRO conducted a proof -of-concept trial that was a double -blinded, two -arm 28 -day placebo 
controlled study of subjects randomly assigned 3:1 to NatrobaTM or Placebo .4 Subjects applied a 
single treat ment over the entire body from the neck down to the toes (including the  soles of the 
feet) in-clinic on Day 1, rubbing the investigational product ( IP) into the skin  and waiting 10 
minutes before getting dressed. Showering or bathing was to occur no earlie r than  6 hours after 
treatment. Efficacy assessments included visual skin assessment of scabies  infestation (visual 
assessment of burrows, lesion counts, and presence of new lesions), skin  scrapi[INVESTIGATOR_106019] (for evidence of mites) and a pruritus score by a  subjective scale. The 
scabies scores were changed by -1.4 with Natroba (p=0.0020), compared to -1.0 with Placebo  
(p=0.2500). The count of lesions was significantly decreased with Natroba ( -28.1, p=0.0020), 
however, not with Placebo  (-9.8, p=0.6250). Microscopy showed significant improvement, 13/15 
negative with Natroba (p=0.0074), compared to 3/5 with Placebo  (p=1.000).  
The design for th e current Phase 3  trial is similar to the phase 3 trials evaluating efficacy of 
Natroba™ Topi[INVESTIGATOR_106020] , although subjects in this trial received 
only one application of the Natroba™ Topi[INVESTIGATOR_49182] .3 In the two phas e 3 studies of 
individuals with lice, all subjects who were treated on Day 0 returned for efficacy evaluation at 
Day 7. Subjects with live lice present at Day 7 received a second treatment. Subjects who were 
lice free on Day 7 were to return on Day 14 for evaluation. Subjects  with live lice and who 
received a second treatment on Day 7 were to return on Days 14 and 21 for evaluation. Efficacy 
was assessed as the proportion of primary subjects who were free of live lice 14 days after the 
initial/final treatment.  
Based on the safety and efficacy of Natroba™  (spi[INVESTIGATOR_105999]) Topi[INVESTIGATOR_49182], 0.9% in the 
treatment of head lice,[ADDRESS_117736] of the Natroba™  (spi[INVESTIGATOR_105999]) Topi[INVESTIGATOR_49182], 0.9% will be  compared 
to that of a Placebo  control.  In addition, pharmacokinetics  (PK)  of Natroba ™ over the first [ADDRESS_117737] -administra tion will be assessed in a pediatric population of 24 subjects aged 4 -16 
years.

ParaPRO, LLC  Confidential  All members of a household (no more than 6 individuals) with a suspected “index” subject must 
be screened at the first visit. In this study, “index” subjects are defined as the youngest infested 
household member (≥4 years). If the household has  at least on e member with  active scabies 
infestation and meet all other criteria, they must all agree to participate in the study. Household 
members who do not present with scabies at the screening visit  must also agree to apply the same 
blinded investigational produc t (IP) as household members who present with scabies (see Table 
6-1 Schedule of Procedures for status assessment). All household members must agree to 
participate in the study or none will be enrolled. Screening procedures include informed consent, 
medication and medical history, urine pregnancy test for females of childbearing potential, 
scabies assessment  (visual evidence of burrows, inflammatory/non -inflammatory les ions and 
pruritus) , microscopic exam ination of skin scrapi[INVESTIGATOR_106022], eggs, and/or scybala  (dermatoscopy must confirm burrows ), vital  signs, general skin 
and eye assessment, randomization, CBC and serum chemistr y, and IP dispensing and 
instruction.  
After screening on Day 1, all randomized subjects in the primary population will be dispensed IP 
(Natroba™ or Placebo) to apply at home later the same day as a single treatment over the entire 
body from the neck down t o the toes (including the soles of the feet ) and to the scalp (if balding)  
or hairline, temples and forehead on the same day. Subjects less than [ADDRESS_117739] 1 hour prior to Day 2

A separate population of 24 pediatric “no n-index” subjects that do not reside in the “index” 
subject’s household will be enrolled to assess the PK of spi[INVESTIGATOR_106004] 12 hours 
after open -label topi[INVESTIGATOR_106005] a single in -clinic visit (Day 1 , or Day 2 if screening only

male or female subjects 4 – 6 years of age) and 12 male or female subjects 10 – 16 years of age. 
With assistance from a caregiver, Natroba™ will be applied over entire bo dy from the neck 
down and to the toes (including the soles of the feet ) and to the hairline, temples and forehead.  
The open -label product will remain on the skin for at least 6 hours before bathing or showering.

population subjects  will return to the clinic for safety and efficacy assessments. The primary 
endpoint of complete cure will be assessed in the infested household members. If the infested 
subject is completely cured at Day 28, he or she will have completed the study and termination 
procedures will be conducted. If the subject is not completely cured at Day 28 (with Natroba™ 
or Placebo), the subject will receive 5% Permethrin and will be directed to their primary care 
physician for follow -up. 
Safety assessments will be made for all household members and will include monitoring of 
adverse events (AEs) througho ut the study, vital signs recording (Days 1 and 28), clinical 
laboratory analyses (Days 1 and 28), and general skin and eye irritation assessments (Days 1, 2,

are described in the Schedule of Procedures  (Table 6-1). 
3.2 Discussion of Study Design  
The phase 3 study design is a generally accepted clinical approach  to provide sufficient pi[INVESTIGATOR_106023].  The design for this trial is similar to the phase 3 
trials evaluating efficacy of Natroba™  Topi[INVESTIGATOR_106024]™  Topi[INVESTIGATOR_49182] .3 In 
the two phase 3 studies of individuals with lice, all subj ects who were treated on Day 0 returned 
for efficacy evaluation at Day 7. Subjects with live lice present at Day 7 received a second 
treatment. Subjects who were lice free on Day 7 were to return on Day 14 for evaluation.

ParaPRO, LLC  Confidential  Subjects with live lice and who re ceived a second  treatment on Day 7 were to return on Days 14 
and 21 for evaluation. Efficacy was  assessed as the proportion of primary subjects who were free 
of live lice 14 days after the initial  and/or final treatment.  
The primary efficacy endpoint will be the proportion of index subjects c omplete ly cured of 
scabies by [CONTACT_2006] [ADDRESS_117744]  (index subject)  from each  unit provides for 
efficacy results that are more independent . These subjects are  selected according to a consistent 
criterion ; in this study “index” subjects will be defined as the youngest (≥4 years) infested 
member of the household. Thus the primary analysis  population  will be the “index” intent -to-
treat ( I-ITT) population  which is defined as all randomized index subjects regardless of whether  
they have had any post -baseline assessments and the primary efficacy endpoint will be  the 
proportion of index subject s complete ly cured of scabies by [CONTACT_2006] [ADDRESS_117745] group received Permethrin  5% cream as single 
application, second group received tablet ivermectin 200 mcg/kg as single dose, and third group 
received ivermectin 1% lotion as single application. All the patients received anti -histaminic for 
pruritus. The patients were followed up a t intervals of 1, 2, 3, and [ADDRESS_117746] week, cure rate was 74.8% in Permethrin  group, 30% in oral 
ivermectin group, and 69.3% in topi[INVESTIGATOR_106025] (P < 0.05). At the end of second week, 
cure rate was 99% in Permethrin  group, 63% in oral ivermectin group, and 100% in topi[INVESTIGATOR_106026] (P < 0.05). At the end of third week, 100% cure rate was observed in 
Permethrin  and topi[INVESTIGATOR_106027] 99% in oral ivermectin group (P = 0.367). While 
oral ivermectin was found to be significantly less effective than the 2 topi[INVESTIGATOR_12969], there

5.3 Methods of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
As “index” subjects and other infested  or non -infes ted household members become eligible for 
randomization at Visit 1 (Day 1), the site will locally assign a unique subject number to each of 
the qualified household members that combines a 3 -digit site number (xxx), a 2 -digit household 
number (yy), and a 2 -digit household member number (zz). For example, the first subject of the 
first household at site [ADDRESS_117756] member to 101 -01-03, and so on. Since all household members 
receive the same treatment, each household is randomized to either Natroba™ (spi[INVESTIGATOR_105999]) or 
Placebo  control.  Non-infested household members will be assigned the same IP treatment as the 
infested members and will be assigned a subject number and randomization nu mber. The 
assigned subject numbers to each household will correspond to unique bottle numbers on a 
scheme that unblinded site personnel will assign and distribute to ensure approximately equal 
randomization of households to either treatment. Subject number s must not be re -used once 
assigned, even if the subject does not take the IP. 
For the pediatric PK population , assignment of a unique subject number will occur as the subject 
becomes eligible for enrollment. Randomization numbers will not be assigned as I P is open -
label.

For both treatment groups, the blinded Natroba™  (spi[INVESTIGATOR_105999] ) or Placebo  control will be 
administered by [CONTACT_26259] [ADDRESS_117758] ’s home . All “index” and other infested and

shower for at least 6 hours after application.  Subjects less than 12 years of age  should be assisted 
with administration by a parent, guardian or caregiver.  
A separate population of 24 “non -index” pediatric subjects with confirmed scabies infestation 
who do not reside in the “index” subject’s household will be recruited for a PK analys is over 12 
hours after topi[INVESTIGATOR_106038] -label Natroba™ application. There will be 12 male or female subjects 4

All household members will be provided with the same blinded study treatment . The IP  will be  
applied at the subject’s home.  
Each subject’s bottle will be  returned the next day at Visit 2.  An accounting of the amount of IP 
used by [CONTACT_423] (by [CONTACT_8497]) will be documented by [CONTACT_46683]. At Visit 2, subjects will 
be asked to confirm that IP was applied from neck down  and to the scalp (if balding)  or hairline,

5.6 Blinding and Unblinding Method  
Eligible households  will be assigned to eith er Natroba™  (spi[INVESTIGATOR_105999]) or Placebo  control, by 
[CONTACT_094]-specif ied un -blinded site personnel. The un -blinded site personnel will assign all eligible 
members from the same househol d to the same treatment group. While t he treatment bottles for 
each household will have unique numbers , the numbers for that household will correspond to a 
specific treatment , Natroba™  (spi[INVESTIGATOR_105999]) or Placebo  control. Un-blinded site staff will maintain 
the randomization sche me with treatment code  and associated bottle numbers , and will no t reveal 
the information to the subjects, blinded study personnel or ParaPRO LLC until after the database 
lock.  
In an emergency, the study blind may be broken only if:  
• in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_11922]/or the Medical Monitor, it is in the subject's best 
interest to do so ; 
• knowledge of the treatment will alter the clinical management of the subject ; 
• approval has been granted by [CONTACT_67806]/or ParaPRO LLC . 
Whenever possible, the Medical Monitor should be notified prior to unblinding a treat ment 
assignment. In the event that unblinding is necessary for the medical management of the subject, 
the pre-specified un -blinded site personnel  will access the randomization code by a treatment 
code list provided by [CONTACT_106083] . If a treatment assignment is unblinded, 
the date and reason for the unblinding must be recorded on the subject’s source document, and 
the Medical Monitor notified within [ADDRESS_117763]. William Mil ler, is ([PHONE_2427] . If [CONTACT_10017] ’s phone is not answered at 
the time of your call , PLEASE leave a message so [CONTACT_10017] can return your call immediately.

The primary reason  for a subject  withdrawing  prematurely  should  be selected  from  the 
following  categories: 
Adverse  Event  or Serio us Adverse  Event —events that are associated  with discontinuation.  
Noncompliance  with protocol —the subject  failed  to adhere  to the protocol  require ments.  The 
deviation  necessitated  premature termination  from  the study.  
Withdrawal  of Consent —subjec t desire s to withdra w from further  participation in the study  in 
the absence  of an adverse  event or a medical  need  to withdraw.  
Lost to Follow -up—the subject  did not return  for one or more follow -up visit(s)  followin g

8.1 Sample Size Determination  
For the primary efficacy analysis, approximately 120 “index” subjects will be enrolled (includ ing 
possible 20% attrition) from 120 households and randomized 1:1 to each of Natroba™ 
(spi[INVESTIGATOR_105999]) and Placebo  control. The index subject will be the youngest infested member of a 
household  (≥4 years).  Referencing to  the Sponsor’s Proof of Concept (POC) study (SPN -401-12) 
and published literature,5-10 out of 60 completed subjects , the cure  rate is 70% for Natroba™ and 
30% for Placebo  control .  Based upon  a reasonable  assumption  of 60% cure rate  for Natroba™  
and 30% for  placebo , a sample size of 48 study -completed “index” subjects per group will 
provide 8 0% power to declare the non -equivalency using a delta of 30% and Type I error rate of 
0.05.   Fisher exact test was used to calculate the sample size  and the specified power  in the  
following Table 8 -1 (PASS 14; 2015, NCSS, LLC., Kaysville, Utah, [LOCATION_003].  www.ncss.com ).

8.3 Analysis Populations  
Safety Population  
The safety population will comprise all subjects who received the adminis tration  of IP.  Subjects 
will be analyzed as treated. The safety population includes the “index” subjects along with any 
household members enrolled in the study as well as all subjects in the pediatric PK analysis. All 
safety analyses will utilize the safety population. It is assumed that approximately 384 subjects 
will be enrolled and receive  one administration  of IP : 120 “index” subjects and 240 “non -index” 
subjects from the primary population, and 24 “non -index” subjects from the pediatric PK 
population .  
Intent -to-Treat Population  
The intent -to-treat (ITT) population will comprise all primary population subjects who were 
randomized . Subjects will be analyzed as randomized.  This population includes the index 
subjects along with any household members enrolled in the stud y. 
Index Intent -to-Treat Population  
The “index” intent -to-treat ( I-ITT) population will comprise all index subjects who were 
randomized . Subjects will be analyzed as randomized. T he index subject will be the youngest 
infested member of a household  (≥4 year s). This analysis population will be used for the efficacy 
analys es.   
Index Per Protocol Population  
The “index” Per Protocol (I -PP) population is a subset of the I -ITT population. Index subjects 
will be excluded from the I -PP population for the following reasons:  
1. Protocol deviations that would be in violation with the established Inclusion or 
Exclusion Criteria.  
2. Protocol deviations that could confound the evaluation of efficacy outcomes:  
o Scabies assessment not performed (i.e. burrows, lesions, pruritis, s kin 
scrapi[INVESTIGATOR_007]) .  
o Subject received the wrong treatment.  
o Discontinuation prior to acquisition of Visit 3 (Day 28) efficacy 
measurements.

presented by [CONTACT_1570].  
Additional analyses can be performed on the I -ITT population by [CONTACT_2931] a logistic regression 
model adjusted for baseline factors.  
Number of New  Lesions  
The number of new lesions at Day 28 will be analyzed using  a negative binomial regression 
model  to compare the treatment difference . The model will include treatment group and study 
site (small sites pooled) as fixed factors, and baseline total lesion count as a covariate.   
This analysis will be performed on the I -ITT population .  
Total Lesion  Counts  
Total lesion counts will be calcu lated as the sum of pre -existing lesions and new lesions. The 
baseline captures the  total lesions  on the day of first study drug administration .  
The change from baseline to Day 28 will be analyzed using an analysis of covariance 
(ANCOVA) model with treatm ent and study site (small sites pooled) as factors and baseline total 
lesion counts as a covariate.  
This analysis will be performed on the I -ITT population .  
Complete Cure in ITT subjects who were infested at baseline  
A subset of subjects in ITT populatio n who were infested at baseline will be summarized to 
display the proportion of the completely cured subjects.  
More analysis can be performed to further examine the treatment differences for this subset of 
ITT subjects. Details will be provided in the SAP.    
[IP_ADDRESS] Pooling of Study Sites  
This is a study conducted at multiple study sites.  Every e ffort will be made to have each site 
enroll at least 8 subjects per arm.  In case there are  “small” sites with few er-than-8 “index” 
subjects , these sites will be  pooled together as a single, combined site for efficacy analyses if the 
combined site has at least 8 “index” subject s per arm .  In the situation when the combined site 
still has less than 8 “index” subjects per arm, the smallest site with at least 8 “inde x” subjects per 
arm will be pooled to this combined site for efficacy analyses.  The complete cure rates at Day 
28 will be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_106103].  Assessment of site -to-site variability  will be conducted on the original sites prior to 
pooling.  In addition, the above demographics and baseline characteristics will be presented by

Adverse  events  will be coded  using  Medical  Dictionary  for Regulatory  Activities  (MedDRA)  
and summarized by [CONTACT_106105]  (SOC)  and Preferred  Term  (PT) for each treatment 
group.  All AEs will be captured  throughout the study period from the enrollment to  the final visit 
(Visit  3) or the ET visit.  Any AEs reported before treatment will be captured as medical 
history. AEs that occur after the first dose of study treatment will be considered as treatment -
emergent  adverse events  (TEAE).  Within each SOC or PT, subjects will be counted o nly once 
if they had  one or  more than one event reported during the treatment period  (the subject is 
counted for the event with the greatest severity) .  
Adverse  events will be summarized  by [CONTACT_106106]:

9.3 Sever ity 
Adverse events are graded according to seriousness and severity.  The seriousness of an event is 
determined by [CONTACT_106114]  9.7.  
The Investigator will evaluate the severity  of each AE. Adverse event  severity  will be graded as  
Mild:    Awareness of symptoms but easily tolerated  
Moderate:  Discomfort enough to interfere with but not prevent daily activity  
Severe:  Unable to perform usual activity  
9.4 Relationship  
The Investigator will judge the likelihood that the AE was related to th e IP according to the 
following criteria : 
• Not related: There is no temporal and/or causal relationship to the IP. 
• Related: There is a possible temporal and/or causal relationship to the IP. 
9.5 Action Taken  and Outcome  
The Action Taken with IP for every AE wil l be reported as Dose Not Changed or Dose 
Withdrawn. The Outcome of each AE will be entered as either: Recovered/Resolved, 
Recovered/Resolved with Sequelae, Not Recovered/Not Resolved, Fatal, or Unknown.

“An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered "unexpected" if it is not listed in 
the investigator brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has  been observed; or, 
if an investigator brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk information 
described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current application, as amended.

ParaPRO, LLC  Confidential  For example, under this definition,  hepatic necrosis would be unexpected (by [CONTACT_106117]) if the investigator brochure referred only to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. 
Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by [CONTACT_106118]) if the investigator brochure listed only cerebral vascular accidents. 
"Unexpected," as used in this definition, also refers to adverse events or suspected adverse 
reactions that are mentioned in the investigator brochure as occurring with a c lass of drugs or as 
anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned 
as occurring with the particular drug under investigation.”

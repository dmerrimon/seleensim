Property of Castle Creek Pharmaceuti cals, LLC    Clinical Study Protocol  1. INTRODUCTION 
This study investigates the irritation potential of CCP -020 (Diacerein 1% topi[INVESTIGATOR_125053])  under  
standardized conditions compared with a known irritant (0.2%  sodium lauryl sulfate, SLS) and 
an inert control (normal saline).  Because CCP -020 (Diacerein 1%)  topi[INVESTIGATOR_135069], it is necessary to determine the potential of this product to cause 
irritation after repeated topi[INVESTIGATOR_135070].   
The study will be conducted in compliance with Food and Drug Administration (F DA) 
regulations, the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki concerning medical research in 
humans (Recommendations Guiding Physicians in Biomedical Research Involving Human 
Subjects, Helsinki 1964 and amendments 2013), the International Conferen ce on Harmonization 
(ICH) – Good Clinical Practice (GCP) Guidelines as currently amended, and all applicable 
standard operating procedures (SOPs) of TKL Research, Inc. (TKL).  
1.1. Background Information  
CCP -020 (previously developed as AC -203) is a topi[INVESTIGATOR_135071] (4,5-
bis[acetyloxy] -9,10-dihydro- 9,10- dioxo- 2-anthracene carboxylic acid; also known as diacetyl -
rhein), a highly purified anthraquinone derivative, and is being developed by [CONTACT_135104][INVESTIGATOR_135072]  (EBS).  The capsule 
formulation of diacerein, intended for oral use and systemic absorption, was initially approved 
for use in osteoarthritis (OA) in Franc e in 1992 (as Artodar®, ART50®, or Zondar®).  Since then, 
it has received marketing authorization in over [ADDRESS_153048] been shown to inhibit the in vitro and 
in vivo production and activity of inte rleukin (IL) -1β and other proinflammatory cytokines.  It 
has a novel mode of action that differentiates it from non- steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs 
(NSAIDs) and other conventional forms of drug therapy.   
For the development of CCP -020, a total of [ADDRESS_153049] been conducted with CCP -
020 ointment 1%, including one skin penetration study, three acute dermal toxicity studies, one 
phototoxicity study, three pharmacokinetic studies, and two sub- chronic juvenile toxicity studies.  
CCP -[ADDRESS_153050] been completed in patients with epi[INVESTIGATOR_135073] (EBS).  These include a Phase one pi[INVESTIGATOR_135074] a Phase 2, 
multiple -site study in 17 patients in Europe.  The Phase 2 study demonstrated CCP -020 was  
well-tolerated  and no treatment -related adverse events (AEs) were reported.  The Investigator’s 
Brochure should be consulted for summaries of the results of these studies.1  
This Phase 1 study will assess the irritation potential of CCP -020 (Diacerein 1%) topi[INVESTIGATOR_135075].  
1.2. Rationale for the Study  
This is a clinical study in -humans treated with CCP -020 (Diacerein 1%) topi[INVESTIGATOR_135076] e irritation potential of CCP -020 (Diacerein 1%) topi[INVESTIGATOR_135077], LLC  Confidential   Page [ADDRESS_153051] (CIPT) design.  
Substances that come into contact [CONTACT_135105] a reproducible, standardized, quantitative patch evaluation procedure that 
demonstrates the study material can be applied safely to human skin without significant risk of 
adverse reactions.[ADDRESS_153052] damage to the epi[INVESTIGATOR_135078] (allergic) mechanism is involved.  This 
proced ure may detect so -called “fatiguing substances,” which are mild irritants that cause more 
strongly positive reactions with successive multiple skin exposure.

comparison study of the investigational produc ts (IPs) (CCP -020 [Diacerein 1%] topi[INVESTIGATOR_135080] ), and positive and negative controls  under occlusive conditions in healthy 
volunteer subjects.  All subjects will have fields designated for the IP patches and the positive 
and negative control patches at 4 randomly  assigned, adjacent sites, for the purpose of 
determining irritation potentia l.   
The IPs and controls will be applied to one side of the infrascapular area of the back.  Evaluation 
of dermal reactions at the application sites will be assessed clinically using a visual scale that 
rates the degree of erythema, edema, and other signs  of cutaneous irritation (see Section 3.5.5).

representative has the right to refuse further participation in the study at any time and without 
providing reasons (see also Section 5.3).  A subject's participation is to be terminate d 
immediately upon his/her request.  The Investigator should seek to obtain the reason and record 
this on the case report form (CRF).  
If at the time of refusal a study product has already been administered, the subject should be 
advised on follow -up safet y investigations. If a subject withdraws from the study, all efforts will 
be made to complete a final evaluation if possible. Subjects discontinued for having experienced 
an AE will be followed until the AE is resolved, a reasonable explanation is provided for the 
event , or the subject is referred to his/her own primary medical doctor (PMD). The specific AE 
in question will be recorded on the appropriate  CRF.  
If a subject develops a serious adverse event (SAE), his/her termination from the study will be 
considered by [CONTACT_737].  Similarly, if the subject develops conditions over the course of 
the study which would have excluded his/her entry in the study according to the safety -related 
medical exclusion criteria, he/she must be withdrawn immediately.    
The subject may be withdrawn from the study at any time at the discretion of the Investigator for 
medical reasons and/or due to non- adherence to the treatment scheme and other duties stipulated 
in the study protocol.  The reasons are to be documented on the CRF.  
Individual patches may be discontinued if a reaction of a grade of 3 or greater (see Section 3.5.5 
for examples of values using additive grades from Tables 3 and Table 4) occurs at any point 
during the study.  Further patch applications of that product on that individual subject will be 
terminated.   A “not patched” (NP) symbol and a score of [ADDRESS_153057] for that particular patch.  See Section 3.5.5 for 
interpretations of scores.   
In addition, the Sponsor retains the right to end the study at any time if the study cannot be 
carried out as agreed upon in the protocol.  In case of premature termination or suspension of the 
study, the Sponsor’s study manager will promptly inform the Investigator/institutions and 
regulatory authorities of the termination or suspension and the reason for that.  It is the 
responsibility of t he Principal Investigator (PI) to notify the Institutional Review Board (IRB) in 
the case of premature termination/suspension.

3.4.5. Assignment to Treatment  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Randomization  
Each subject who signs an informed consent form (ICF) will be assigned a screening number.  If 
the subject meets all of the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria, and successfully 
completes the screening procedures, they will be enrolled in the study.  Upon enrollment, each 
subject will be assigned a unique subject number and receive a randomization code, indicating 
application placement of t he study materials.  Each subject in this study will serve as his or her 
own control.  All subjects will receive the IPs and control products at adjacent application sites.   
The IPs ( CCP -020 [Diacerein 1%] topi[INVESTIGATOR_135081])  and study controls (SLS and 
saline) will be assigned in a randomized sequence to test Sites [ADDRESS_153058] site 
throughout the study.   
[IP_ADDRESS]. Blinding  
The treatments (IPs and control) will not be blinded to investigative personnel involved in the 
preparation/application and removal of treatments.   
Investigative personnel who are involved in the preparation/application and removal of the 
treatments will not perform the evaluation of skin responses.  Investigative personnel who are 
involved in the preparation/application and removal of the treatments will be unblinded.  The 
trained evaluator who wi ll be evaluating skin responses  will be blinded to IPs and control and the

following patch removal, complete blinding of the evaluators cannot be completely assured.  
Investigative personnel, including the Investigator and trained evaluator involved in the 
evaluation of responses, will remain blinded during the course of the study until Database Lock 
and finalization of the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
In the event of an emergency, if possible, the Investigator or de signee will contact [CONTACT_135110].  If it 
is not possible to notify the Sponsor prior to the unblinding, the Investigator or designee will 
contact [CONTACT_135111] a written 
notification to document the exact manner in which the code was broken and the justification for 
the unblinding. The Investigator will communicate the treatment identification to only the 
investigative personnel who require the information to manage the emergency.  Unblinding will 
happen on site at TKL.  
3.4.6. Prior and Concomitant Therapy  
All medications, including over the counter (OTC) drugs and vitamins, taken within [ADDRESS_153059]’s CRF.  
The following prohibitions will apply for the duration of the study:  
• There will be no use of systemic/topi[INVESTIGATOR_900] -inflammatory analgesics which in the

• Use of sunbeds or sunlamps or deliberate exposure of the test sites to natural sunlight 
or to other sources of ultraviolet ( UV) light; 
• Participation in any other clinical study;  
• Soaking of test areas; and/or  
• Application of any product to t he test areas.  
The use of or change in the dose of any and all concomitant medication, either prescription or 
OTC, during the study will be recorded.  The reason for use or change of dose of a concomitant 
therapy may need to be reported as an AE.  Therapie s (medication and non -medication therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014])

Screening  
At Screening, the subjects will receive any necessary written an d verbal information, and the 
informed consent  of each subject will be obtained.  Demographic data (including Fitzpatrick skin 
type) will be recorded, a medical history will be taken, and previous and concomitant 
medications will be reviewed.  Eligibility will be determined by [CONTACT_135113] e 
inclusion/exclusion criteria.   
• Any written and verbal information 
• Informed consent  
• Demographics  
• Previous/concomitant medication  
• Review of inclusion and exclusion criteria  
• Medical history (including lifestyle and habits)  
• Examination  of application site area

participation in the study.  A Baseline evaluation of the patch sites will be performed prior to 
application of the patches to ensure that no conditions, markings, or coloration of the skin will 
interfere with interpretation of the study results. Subjects will receive a unique randomization 
number, which determines the application scheme of the study materials for that individual 
subject.   
A set of [ADDRESS_153061]’s back.  The choice o f left or 
right side will be made by [CONTACT_135114] a visual inspection of skin clarity 
and will be recorded on the CRF to ensure consistent placement of the patches at subsequent 
visits. The distance between the patches will be approximately [ADDRESS_153062]’s back by [CONTACT_135115].  
CCP -020 (Diacerein 1%) topi[INVESTIGATOR_135089] 0.2 mL to 
a 2 cm x 2 cm Webril® patch pad via Eppendorf® Combitips and then applied to the subject’s 
skin surface as soon as possible following product application. The sterile 0.9% saline (negative 
control) and 0.2% SLS (positive control) will be applied to a 2 cm x 2 cm Webril® patch pad via 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_135090]’s skin s urface.  All 4 products will be evaluated under 
occlusive patch conditions by [CONTACT_135109] a 2 cm x 2 cm Webril® pad.  The patches 
will be secured with hypoallergenic tape as needed.  
Days 2- 21  
The patches will be removed 24 ±  [ADDRESS_153063] ication.  Excess study material will be 
removed with a tissue to avoid the transference of materials between sites by [CONTACT_135116].  Investigative personnel responsible for patch application/removal will wipe each site 
with distilled water.  A trained and blinded evaluator will perform an assessment of all test sites 
for irritation symptoms immediately (within 30 minutes) following patch removal using the 
scoring system detailed in Section 3.5.5.  Scores will be entered into the data sheets by [CONTACT_3433] e 
evaluator.  If the skin is not disrupted (skin irritation score ≤ 2), identical treatments and patches 
will be re -applied to the same test sites with investigational products and control solutions using 
the procedures above.  Separate individuals will be  responsible for evaluation of the test sites 
(blinded) and patch application/removal (unblinded).  Individual patches may be discontinued if 
a reaction of a grade of 3 or greater (see Section 3.5.5) occurs at any point during the study.  
Further patch app lications of that product on that individual subject will be terminated.  A NP 
symbol and a score of [ADDRESS_153064] -baseline evaluation scores will be assigned to assess 
cumulative irritancy.

The actual patch test grades are a combination of a numerical ( Table 3 ) and letter ( Table 4 ) 
grades consistent with the definitions given in the grading scales. However, in order to determine 
discontinuation of a patch site (grade > 3) and to perform statistical analyses, grades containing 
letter grades have to be converted to numerical equivalents. These are converted as follows: A=0, 
C=1, E=2 and F, G, and H =3. These equivalents are considered additive to any numerical score 
(e.g., 2C=2+1=3) , in this case the patch site would be discontinued.

3.6. Adverse Events  
3.6.1. Method of Determining Adverse Events  
Safety assessments will  include recording AEs reported spontaneously by [CONTACT_135119].  AEs will be recorded at each visit throughout the study on the appropriate 
CRF.  Every attempt should be made to describe the AE in terms of a diagnosis.  If a clear 
diagnosis has been made, individual signs and symptoms will not be recorded unless they 
represent atypi[INVESTIGATOR_49197], in which case they should be 
reported as separate events.   
Subjects should be asked whether, since  the time of the last observation or visit, they had any of 
the following:  
• Experience any changes in well -being;  
• Used any new medications;  
• Changed medication regimens (both prescription and OTC); and/or  
• Were admitted to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_49198].  
All questions should be of a general nature and should not suggest symptoms.   
When an AE is suspected, all relevant evaluations will be carried out and appropriate treatment 
provided.  Additional follow -up will be done as necessary ( Section 3.6.4) and rec orded in the 
subject’s source documents, and the results will be provided to the Sponsor.

Date 23-October -2017   Amendment 1  
 
Property of Castle Creek Pharmaceuti cals, LLC    Clinical Study Protocol  For AE definitions and reporting requirements refer to Section 3.6.2 and Section 3.6.3.  
Note:  Any observed response which can be denoted using the irritation crit eria summarized in 
Table 3  and Table 4 will not be considered an AE .  Likewise, any tape- related irritation will only  
be noted as an AE  when all patches are discontinued due to tape reaction around all sites  (see 
Section 3.6.6) . 
3.6.2. Adverse Event Definitions  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Events  
Information about all local and systemic AE s, whether volunteered by [CONTACT_423], discovered by 
[CONTACT_49232], or detected through other means, will be collected and recorded on the 
AE CRF and followed as appropriate.   
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product (or cosmetic product), which does not necessarily have a 
causal relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore, be any u nfavorable and unintended 
sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal investigational 
product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal investigational product.   
Adverse Events will be coded using  the Medical Dict ionary for Regulatory Activities  (Med DRA).  
Medical conditions/diseases present before starting study treatment are considered AEs only if 
they worsen after starting study treatment (any procedures specified in the protocol).  Any AEs 
occurring before start ing study treatment but after signing the ICF are recorded on the Medical 
History/Current Medical Conditions CRF.  
To the extent possible, each AE will also be described by:  
1. its duration (start and end dates),  
2. the severity grade (mild, moderate, severe)  
3. its relationship to the study drug,  
4. the action(s) taken, and  
5. as relevant, the outcome.  
Note:  Any observed response which can be denoted using the irritation criteria summarized in 
Table 3 and Table 4 will not be considered an AE.  Likewise, any tape -related irritation will not 
be noted as an AE.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Serious Adverse Events  
A “SAE” is any AE that:  
• Results in death;  
• Is life -threatening (Note: the term “life -threatening” refers to any AE that, as it 
occurs, puts the subject at immediate risk of death.  It does not  refer to an AE that 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe).

Property of Castle Creek Pharmaceuti cals, LLC    Clinical Study Protocol  • Results in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_49199] (not including 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a pre -existing condition that has not increased in severity or 
frequency from the subject’s underlying medical condition prior to entry into the 
study).  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a subject.  
• Is another serious (important medical events) event.  
• Results in persistent or significant disabilit y/incapacity.  
(Note: Important medical events may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_49200], based on the appropriate medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the subject or require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above.  Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm 
requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home; blood dyscrasias or convulsions 
that do not result in inpatie nt hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.)  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Severity of Adverse Events  
“Severity” of the AE refers to the extent to which an AE affects the subject’s daily activities and 
differs from “Serious,” which is a regulatory classificatio n.   
The Investigator is to classify the severity of an AE according to the following definitions: 
• Mild:  The symptom has a negligible effect or no impairing effect on the subject’s 
normal function.  
• Moderate:  The symptom impairs the subject’s normal function to some extent.  
• Severe:  The symptom has an obvious, significantly impairing effect on the subject’s 
normal function.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Relationship of Adverse Events to Study Treatments  
The Investigator is to classify the drug relationship of an AE according to the def initions outlined 
in Table 6 .

Not related  (1) the existence of a clear alternative explanation (e.g., mechanical bleeding at surgical 
site) or (2) non- plausibility, e.g., the subject is struck by [CONTACT_135120][INVESTIGATOR_007] a few days after drug administration.  
  
Unlikely  There is no medical evidence to suggest that the AE may be related to study drug usage, 
or there is another more probable  medical explanation.  
  
Possible  There is medical evidence to suggest that there is a reasonable possibility that the AE may 
be related to study drug usage. However, other medical explanations cannot be excluded 
as a possible cause.  
  
Probable  There  is strong medical evidence to suggest that the AE is related to study drug usage.  
  
Definite  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality (if applicable), in which there is no 
uncertainty in its relationship to test drug (e .g., positive Rechallenge).  
3.6.3. Reporting Adverse Events  
Adverse events that occur from the time of first dose  through completion of the last study visit 
should be reported.  All SAEs, regardless of causality, occurring from the time of informed  
consent until [ADDRESS_153068]’s last 
application of study medication, whichever is longer, must be reported to TKL Clinical Safety 
within 24 hours of the knowledge of the occurrence (this refers to any adverse event that meets 
any of the aforementioned serious criteria ). SAEs occurring after the [ADDRESS_153069] is referred to his/her own PMD.  The Investigator  and the Sponsor will 
decide if longer follow -up is appropriate on a case -by-case basis.  Subjects who experience any 
clinica lly significant AE will remain under medical supervision until the Investigator or the 
Sponsor’s Medical Monitor deems the AE to be resolved, stabilized, or no longer serious enough 
to warrant follow -up.   
Castle Creek Pharmaceuticals, LLC  Confidential   Page [ADDRESS_153070] document this discussion.   
A UPT will be performed on all females of childbearing potential at Day 1 (day of first patch 
application) and EOS.  All women of childbearing potential will receive a UPT prior to the first 
study drug administration and the study drug mu st be withheld until the results of laboratory 
pregnancy testing are available.  If pregnancy is confirmed, the subject must not receive any study drug and must not be enrolled in the study.  
3.6.6. Expected Adverse Events  
Any observed response in the patch test area that can be denoted using the irritation criteria 
summarized in Table [ADDRESS_153071] will continue on the study.  This will be noted in 
the database as “T” as indicated in Table [ADDRESS_153072] be reported immediately (i .e., not later than [ADDRESS_153073] 
knowledge) by e -mail with the scanned TKL SAE report form to: 
 
 
   
3.7.2. R eporting Responsibility  
Any death, SAE, pregnancy, (see Section 3.6), or unusual frequency of AEs, must be reported 
immediately (i.e., not later than [ADDRESS_153074] learning of its occurrence) to the Sponsor’s study manager by [CONTACT_737], even if the event(s) appear to be unrelated to study treatment.  Follow-up information about a previously reported SAE or pregnancy must also be reported to 
the Sponsor within 24 hours of receiving it.  If the SAE or pregnancy has not been previously 
documented (i.e., is a new occurrence) and it is thought to be related to the investigational product (or therapy), the Sponsor may contact [CONTACT_14546].  If 
warranted, an investigator alert may be issued,  to inform all I nvestigators involved in any study 
with the same product (or therapy) that this SAE  or pregnancy has been reported.

Date 23-October -2017   Amendment 1  
 
Property of Castle Creek Pharmaceuti cals, LLC    Clinical Study Protocol  The IRB should also be notified of SAEs or pr egnancies and of any follow -up information in 
writing, as is practical, and depending on local regulations.   
3.7.3. Reporting procedures  
For each SAE, the Investigator  will complete a SAE Report  Form in English and assess the 
relationship of each SAE to study tr eatment.  The completed form(s) should be sent by e -mail to 
the S ponsor within [ADDRESS_153075] knowledge of the SAE (as outlined in Section 3.7.1 and 
Section 3.7.2).  The initial SAE should be reported immediately, even if only preliminary 
information is  available.  Follow -up information should be sent by [CONTACT_49238] , 
restating the date of the original report.  Either a new SAE f orm is sent (stating that it is a follow -
up), or the original one is resent (with the new information highlighted and a new date provided).  
The follow -up should describe whether the event has resolved or continues, if and how it was 
treated, whether the blind was broken or not, and whether the patient continued or discontinued 
study participation.  The form confirmation will be retained.  
Pregnancy follow -up (as outlined in Section 3.6.5) should be reported to the IRB within [ADDRESS_153076] with the cumulative irritation response of the controls.  The 
primary parameter for cumulative irritancy will be the mean  cumulative irritation score.   
The statistical analyses described below will be supplemented by a comprehensive Statistical 
Analysis Plan (SAP) which will be finalized before the database is locked.  Any changes to the 
statistical plans will be described and justified in the final report.  
All statistical processing will be performed using the SAS® system (version 9.2 or higher).  No 
interim or subgroup analyses are planned.  
4.2. Sample Size and Power C onsiderat ions 
The sample size of [ADDRESS_153077] Populations for A nalysis 
All subjects who receive treatment will be evaluable for safety (cumul ative irritancy and AE s). 
4.3.1. Background and Demographic C haracteristics  
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize demographic characteristics (age, gender,  
Fitzpatrick skin type, and race) and background characteristics for the randomized subject 
popul ation.  Past/coexistent medical history information for all randomized subjects will be 
presented in a by -subject listing.

4.6. Safety E valuation  
4.6.1. Cumulative I rritancy  
Individual irritancy scores will be displayed in a data listing for all subjects, products, and 
readings, along with the mean and total of the scores.   
Castle Creek Pharmaceuticals, LLC  Confidential   Page [ADDRESS_153078] observed score (3) will be 
carried forward through all subsequent readings ( Table 3 a nd Table 4).   
The primary variable of interest is the mean cumulative irritation score.  The total cumulative 
irritation score for each subject and product will also be calculated as the sum of irritation scores.  
These parameters will be tested pairwise for product differences using Fisher’s protected least 
significant differences in the context of the [ADDRESS_153079] analysis of variance (ANOVA), including 
main effects of subject and product, without interaction.  Pairwise differences will be tested only 
if the null hypothesis of a common mean score for all products is rejected at the 5% level.   
Once the maximum score (combined score of a Response Symbols and Numerical equivalents 
and an effect on super facial layers of the skin)  of a [ADDRESS_153080] will contribute only once (e .g., the first occurrence) to each of the rates, regardless 
of the number of occurrences (events) the subject experiences.   
Treatment -emergent AEs will be summarized and tabulated by [CONTACT_135121], by [CONTACT_926] (mild, moderate, severe) and by [CONTACT_134345] ( Yes or 
No). 
Treatment -emergent will be defined as any AE with an onset date on or after the first study 
product administration date.  Any event with a missing onset date will be included as a 
treatment -emergent AE.

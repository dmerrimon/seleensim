Answer/Response:   
Transversus Abdominis Plane (TAP) block is a useful tool in pain management after  
abdominal surgery. It is a regional nerve block that tar gets T6 -L1 thoracolumbar  
nerves running in the plane between internal oblique and transversus abdominis  
muscle. It is shown to help with post -operative pain management, reducing pain  
scores and narcotic pain medication use, as well as promoting earlier ret urn to activity  
and recovery.1,[ADDRESS_1070541] for many different abdominal surgeries ranging from obstetric procedures to  
general surgery procedures like colorectal surgery.3,4 Furthermore, it is used in plastic  
surgery procedures such as Deep Inferior Epi[INVESTIGATOR_778836] (DIEP) free flap or  
Transverse Rectus Abdominis Myocutaneous (TRAM) flap, as they involve extensive  
amount of abdominal soft tissue incision. Previous studies have shown that TA P 
block in these procedures significantly reduce post -op pain and narcotic pain  
medication use.5,6 More recently, Exparel (liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]) has risen to spotlight for 
providing a longer, sustained local anesthesia. Various surgical disciplines have a dopted this 
agent as part of their pain management protocol. However, there are no literatures that 
describe the effect of TAP block using Exparel for breast free flap population. We hypothesize 
that delivering TAP block with Exparel (vs. plain bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] ) will provide longer regional 
blocking effect, hence aiding in pain control and recovery postoperatively.  
 
Objectives/Hypothesis  
Answer/Response:  
 We hypothesize that liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] (Exparel) TAP block will provide longer pain 
control compared to plain bupi[INVESTIGATOR_778837] -based free flap breast.  
 Primary outcome = post -op pain scores during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], post -op narcotic pain 
medication use during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], post -op narcotic pain medication use after 
discharge  (within 30 days o f discharge)  
 Secondary outcome = Length of stay, Post -op nausea and vomiting (PONV)

Human Participants  
Ages:  _18 and older ___ 
Sex:  __Female __ 
Race:  ___Any_ 
 
Subjects - see below  
 
1.  Pr ovide target # of subjects (at all sites) needed to complete protocol.  
Answer/Response:   
100 participants  
 
2.  Describe expected rate of screen failure/ dropouts/withdrawals from all sites.   
Answer/Response:   
Minimal.  
Once the patient consent s to the st udy, it is unlikely that they will drop out or 
withdrawal afterwards given that this is part of a usual care  pain management protocol. 
No extra follow up is required for patients  and all the outcomes will be part of a usual 
post -op data that will be record ed in Epic.  
 
3.  How many subjects will be enrolled at all sites?    
Answer/Response:   
This is a single site study – enrollment at UVA only.  
 
4.  How many subjects will sign a consent for m under this UVA protocol?     
Answer/Response:   
All participants (1 00)

Statistical Considerations  
1. Is stratification/randomization involved?  
Answer/Re sponse:  Yes 
 
►IF YES, describe the stratification/ randomization scheme.  
 
Answer/Response:  
Random number generator will be used to enroll a subject into control TAP vs. Exparel 
TAP block group after consent is obtained before surgery. Patients will be blinded to 
their TAP block method. Surgeons/PI/ study coordinators will not be blinded to 
randomization. Surgeons/ PI/ study coordinators will have access to the randomization 
scheme.

2.  What are the statistical considerations for the protocol?  
Answer/Resp onse:  
 This is a randomized, prospective trial that examines the effectiveness of 
Exparel TAP block (mix of Exparel + plain bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]) compared to plain 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_778839] 2021 and January 2024.  Patient information will be kept 
confidential and all identifying information will be removed. Data collected 
will involve:  
o General Demographic Data: age, gender, race, ethnicity, medical and 
surgical history, psychiatric history, medications, drug, smok ing, 
alcohol abuse, occupation  
o Type of Reconstructive Procedure: procedure type, laterality

Page Number: 4 of 6 o TAP block information: liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_76188]. plain bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]  
o Post -operative Narcotic Requirement: total mg of oral opi[INVESTIGATOR_778840] -operative 
period (30 days after discharge).  
o Post -operative Data: LOS, pain scores , PONV incidence  
o Complications  
3.  Provide a justification for the sample size used in this protocol.   
Answer/Response:   The primary outcome va riable used for sample size calculation is post -
operative narcotic requirement.   Since we are unsure of the exact standard deviation for the 
population in terms of narcotic requirement, but we do have a limited number of patients that 
will be available for  the study, we used four different standard deviations to confirm that we 
would have enough patients for 80% power (alpha = 0.05) to detect a difference in groups.   We 
believe that the estimate of the standard deviation is most likely in the [ADDRESS_1070543] a difference of 5.66 mg between groups at 
80% power.  
Sample sizes  Standard 
deviation  Alpha  Power  Difference that 
can be detected  
50 50  1 0.05 80% 0.57 mg  
50 50  5 0.05 80% 2.83 mg  
50 50  10 0.05 80% 5.66 mg  
50 50  15 0.05 80% 8.49 mg  
 
 
4.  What is your plan for primary variable analysis?  
Answer/Response:  
Univariate analysis with Alpha <0.05 considered significant, variables with p<0.[ADDRESS_1070544]-op recovery data - pain scores and postop narcotic 
requirement (total mg of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]) both during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_222627] 30 days after discharge.  
Secondary outcomes will include  LOS and incidence of PONV.

Answer/Response:  
Secondary outcomes will include LOS and PONV.  
Two -sample t -tests or Mann -Whitney U tests will b e employed for secondary variable analysis.    
Exploratory multivariate analysis will be employed to determine potential confounding 
variables and attempt to determine the focus for future studies to determine independent 
factors associated with various out comes.

Protocol Title: A Phase, [ADDRESS_535811] of Food and Tablet Crushing on the Pharmacokinetics of Soticlestat in 
Healthy  Adult Participants
Study Design:
This is a 2 -part, open -label study conducted in healthy adult participants. Part A will evaluate the bioequivalence 
(BE) of [ADDRESS_535812] of food and tablet crushing on 
soticlestat pharmacokine tics (PK).
Each part will be conducted independently as a randomized, 3 -period, crossover design. Study schematics of the 
study design are shown in Table 2.a, Table 2.b, Table 2.c, and Table 2.d. A schedule of assessments is shown in 
Schedule of Study Procedures (Section 3.0).
The two study parts may be conducted concurrently. Participants can only participate in one study part.
Part A:
Participants will be screened within 4 weeks (28 days) prior to the first dosi ng (Day  -[ADDRESS_535813] dosing on Day 1 of 
Period 1). Upon completion of screening, qualified participants will be admitted to the study site on Day -1 of Period 
1 and will remain confined until completion of study procedures on Day 5 of Period 3. Participant s may be admitted 
earlier than Day -1 for COVID -19 testing not related to study protocol, as per CRU requirements.
In each period, on Day 1, participants will receive a single oral dose of 300 mg soticlestat administered as T4 tablets 
(Treatment A), T3 mini-tablets (Treatment B), or commercial tablets (Treatment C), in a [ADDRESS_535814] crossover fashion. 
Blood samples for the PK of soticlestat  will be collected at scheduled time points from 
predose through 96 hours postdose. There will be a wa shout period of exactly 4 days between each soticlestat doses.
Safety and tolerability will be assessed throughout the study by [CONTACT_3148] -emergent adverse events (TEAEs), clinical 
laborato ry evaluations, phy sical examinations, Columbia -Suicide Severity Rat ing Scale (C-SSRS ), 12-lead 
electrocardiograms (ECGs), and vital signs.
After discharge, the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) will contact [CONTACT_55473] (including participants who terminate 
the study  early ) 14 (±3) day s after the last soticlestat administr ation by [CONTACT_424102] (AEs) have occurred and/or any concomitant medications were taken 
since the last study visit. If clinically significant findings are observed upon discharge, participa nts may  return to the 
CRU for re -evaluation per Investigator’s discretion.
Part B: 
Participants will be screened within 4 weeks (28 days) prior to the first dosing (Day -[ADDRESS_535815] dosing on Day 1 of 
Period 1). Upon completion of screening, qualified par ticipants will be admitted to the study site on Day -[ADDRESS_535816] T4 
tablets under fasting conditions (Treatment D), intact T4 tablets fed conditions (Treatment E), or as crushed T4 
tablets mixed with applesauce under fasting conditions (Treatment F), in a [ADDRESS_535817] all participants (including participants who terminate the study early) 14 (±3) 
days after the last soticlestat administration by [CONTACT_424103]/or any concomitant med icatio ns were taken since the last study visit. If clinically significant 
findings are observed upon discharge, participants may return to the CRU for re -evaluatio n per Investigator’s 
discretio n.
Study Primary Objectives:
Part A: 
To assess the BE of 300 mg soticlestat administered as T3 mini -tablets (Treatment B) compared to 300 mg 
soticlestat administered as T4 tablets (Treatment A).

development as an oral adjunct to standard of care therapy  for the treatm ent of rare pediatric 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_424094] (DEE) which is a cluster 
of pedi atric epi[INVESTIGATOR_424095] (DS) and Lennox Gastaut 
Syndrome (LGS).
Nonclinical Background
Soticlestat was evaluated in a series of nonclinical pharmaco logy, toxi cology, and drug 
metabo lism and PK studies in accordance wit h relevant Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
guidance docum ents. The results supported invest igational new drug (IND) opening study. The 
complete resul ts from nonclinical  studi es dem onstrated a favorable benefit over the risk potential 
of soticlestat for further clinical evaluat ion through Phase [ADDRESS_535829] igator’s Brochure (IB) [ 1].
Clinical Background
The PK, safety , tolerabili ty, and/or efficacy  of soticl estat h ave been evaluated in 6 Phase 1 
clinical studies in healt hy part icipants (com pleted), a Phase 1b/2a study  in part icipants wi th 
DEEs (com pleted), and 3 Phase 2 studies in part icipants wi th DS, LGS, 15q11 -q13 duplicat ion 
syndro me (Dup15q), cyclin- dependent k inase -like 5 (CDKL5) deficiency  disorder (CDD), or 
complex regi onal pain syndrome (com pleted). One (1) Phase [ADDRESS_535830] ive treatment based on actual exposure and enro llment data from co mpleted and 
ongoing clinical trials as of the safet y data cut -off date (19 November 2021).
In the [ADDRESS_535831] healt hy partic ipants up to 600 mg daily (either as 600 mg once 
daily  [QD] or 300 m g twice daily [BID], without up- titration). Two parti cipants discont inued 
study  drug due to a TEAE: one with acute psy chosis (Cohort 4: soti clestat 600 mg QD) that was 
reported as severe i ntensity, and one wi th mild confusio nal state (Cohort 3: soticlestat 300 mg 
BID) occurring on study  Day  10. There was no addi tional treatm ent requi red bey ond cessati on of  
study  drug f or these events. No safet y issues of concern were ident ified based on ass essments of 
physical examinat ions, vital sign measurements, clinical laboratory  values, or [ADDRESS_535832] of food and 
tablet crushing on soticlestat PK. 
Each part will be c onducted independent ly as a randomized, 3 -period, crossover design. Study  
schemat ics of the study design are shown in Table 2.a, Table 2.b, Table 2.c, and Table 2.d. A 
schedule of assessments is shown in Schedule of Study  Procedures (Secti on

participant acts as their own con trol. There will be a washout period of 4 day s between the 
soticlestat doses and is considered sufficient to prevent carry over effects of the preceding 
treatm ent.
6.4.2 Rationale for Do se 
The dose of soticlestat selected for this 2 -part study  is 300 mg, the recommended Phase 3 dose. 
In clinical studies, soticlestat when administered as a single -dose up to 1350 mg was safe and 
well tolerated by [CONTACT_424106]. The increase in sotic lestat exposure from 300 mg to 
1350 mg is >4 -fold.Taken together the dose is not anticipated to cause any  risk or benefit to the 
subjects participat ing in this study .

[IP_ADDRESS] Pharmacokinetic Endpoints
The PK endpo ints are standard for this type of  study .
[IP_ADDRESS] Safety Endpoints
The key  safety endpo ints are ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_323901] [ADDRESS_535839] dosing. Tubes or containers will 
be ident ified wit h a barcode using an appropriate label.
No di seases/condit ions, deoxy ribonucleic acid, or ribo nucleic acid will be analyzed in this study . 
The analyses will focus on PK profiling for soticlestat . Sam ples will not 
be submitted to a public database. The Sponsor and contract research organi zations involved in 
the clinical conduct, bioanaly tical analyses, and PK and statist ical analysis o f the data will have 
access to the samples and/or the data that resulted from the analysis, if performed.

CONFIDENTIAL7.5 Criteria for Discon tinuation or Withdrawal of a Participant
The primary  reason for di scont inuat ion or wi thdrawal  of the parti cipant from  the study  or study 
drug should be recorded in the case report form (CRF) using the fo llowing categori es.
1.Pretreatment event (PTE) or AE: T he participant has experienced a PTE or AE that 
requi res early termination because cont inued participat ion imposes an unacceptable risk 
to the parti cipant’s health or the participant is unwilling to continue because of the PTE 
or AE. 
LFT Abnormalit ies:
Study drug should be discont inued immediately with appropriate clinical fo llow-up 
(including repeat laboratory  tests, until a participant’s laboratory  profile has returned to 
norm al/baseline status, see Section 9.2.7 , if the fo llowing circumstances occur at any t ime 
during study  drug treatm ent:
ALT or AST >[ADDRESS_535863], or
ALT or AST >[ADDRESS_535864] and persists for more than 2 weeks, or

ALT or AST >[ADDRESS_535867] with appearance of fat igue, nausea, vo miting, right upper 
quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, and/or eosinophilia ( >5%).
QTcF interval: 
Study  drug shoul d be discontinued immediately with appropriate clinical fo llow-up if a 
QTcF interval >500 msec or if there is an increase of QTcF >60 msec above baseline 
detected by  [CONTACT_25310] a repeat ECG. Appropriate cli nical fo llow-up 
includes a repeat ECG. 
2.Significant protocol  deviat ion: The discovery post -enrollment that the participants failed 
to meet protocol  entry  criteria or di d not adhere to protocol requirements, and continued 
participat ion poses an unacceptable risk to the participant’s healt h.
3.Lost to follow -up: Attem pt to contact [CONTACT_424116]. Attempts to 
contact [CONTACT_424117]’s source documents. 
4.Voluntary  withdrawal: The participants (or participant’s legally  acceptable 
representative) wishes to withdraw fro m the study . The reason for withdrawal, if 
provi ded, shoul d be recorded i n the CRF. 
Note: All attempts should be made to determine the underl ying reason for the withdrawal 
and, where possible, the primary  underlying reason shoul d be recorded (i e, wi thdrawal  
due to an AE should not be recorded in the “vo luntary withdrawal” category ). If a 
participant chooses to withdraw fro m study  parti cipati on due to personal concerns related 
to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) pandemic (other than a COVID -19-related 
AE), this should be specified as the reason for participant withdrawal in the CRF.

An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unint ended sign (eg, a clinically significant 
abnorm al laboratory  finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, 
whether or not it is considered related to the drug.
An untoward finding generally may:
Indicate a new diagnosis or unexpected worsening of a preexist ing condit ion. (Intermittent 
events for pre -exist ing condit ions or underlying disease should not be considered AEs)
Necessitate therapeutic intervent ion.
Requi re an invasive diagnostic procedure.
Requi re discont inuat ion or a change in dose of study  medicat ion or a concom itant 
medicat ion.
Be considered unfavorable by [CONTACT_47392].
Diagnoses versus signs and symptoms:
Each event should be recorded to represent a single diagnosis. Acco mpanying signs 
(including abnormal laboratory  values or ECG findings) or symptoms should NOT be 
recorded as additional AEs. If a diagnosis is unknown, sign(s) or symptom(s) should be 
recorded appropriately as an AE(s).
Laboratory  values and ECG findings:
Changes in laboratory  values or ECG param eters maybe considered AEs if th ey are j udged to 
be clinically  significant (i e, if som e act ion or intervent ion is required or if the Invest igator 
judges the change to be beyo nd the range of normal physio logic fluctuati on). A l aboratory  re-
test and/or continued mo nitoring of an abnormal v alue are not consi dered an intervent ion. In 
addition, repeated or addit ional noninvasive testing for verificat ion, evaluat ion or m onitoring 
of an abnorm ality is not considered an intervention.
If abnorm al laboratory  values or ECG findings are the result of pathol ogy for which there is 
an overall diagnosis (eg, increased creatinine in renal failure), the diagnosis only should be 
reported appropriately  as an AE.
Pre-exist ing condit ions:
A pre -exist ing condit ion (present at the time of signing of informed cons ent) i s consi dered a 
concurrent medical history  condi tion and shoul d NOT be recorded as an AE. A baseline 
evaluat ion (eg, laboratory  test, ECG, X -ray, etc) shoul d NOT be recorded as an AE unless

CONFIDENTIALrelated to a study  procedure. However, if the participant exp eriences a worsening or 
complicat ion of such a concurrent medical history  condi tion, the worsening or complication 
shoul d be recorded appropriately as an AE (worsening or complicat ion occurs after informed 
consent is signed). Investigators should ensure th at the event term  recorded captures the 
change in the condit ion (eg, “worsening of…”).
If a participant has a pre -exist ing epi[INVESTIGATOR_45283] (eg, asthma, epi[INVESTIGATOR_002] ), any occurrence of 
an epi[INVESTIGATOR_304503], serious, 
or severe in nature, that is, Investigators should ensure that the AE term recorded captures the 
change from Baseline in the condit ion (eg “worsening of…”).
If a participant has a degenerat ive concurrent condit ion (eg, cataracts, rheumat oid arthri tis), 
worsening of the condit ion shoul d only  be captured as an AE if occurring to a greater extent 
to that which would be expected. Again, Invest igators should ensure that the AE term 
recorded captures the change in the condit ion (eg, “worsening of…”).
Worsening of AEs:
If the participant experiences a worsening or complicat ion of an AE after the first 
administration of study  medicati on and after any  change in study  medicat ion, the worsening 
or com plicat ion shoul d be recorded as a new AE. Investig ators should ensure that the AE 
term recorded captures the change in the condit ion (eg, “worsening of…”).
Changes in severit y of AEs:
If the participant experiences a change in the severit y of an AE that i s not associ ated wi th a 
change in study  medicati on,the event should be captured once with the maximum severit y 
recorded.
Prepl anned surgeries or procedures:
Prepl anned procedures (surgeries or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) that were scheduled prior to signing of 
inform ed consent are not considered AEs. However, if a preplanned procedure is performed 
early  (eg, as an em ergency) due to a worsening of the pre -exist ing condit ion, the worsening 
of the condi tion shoul d be captured appropri ately  as an AE. Com plicati ons resul ting fro m 
any planned surgery  shoul d be reported as AEs.
Elective surgeries or procedures:
Elect ive procedures performed where there is no change in the participant’s medical 
condi tion shoul d not be recorded as AEs but should be documented in the participant’s 
source documents. Complicat ions result ing from an ele ctive surgery should be reported as 
AEs.
Overdose:
An overdose is defined as a known deliberate or accidental administration of investigational 
drug, to or by  a study parti cipant, at a dose above that which is assigned to that individual 
participant accord ing to the study  protocol . It is up to the Invest igator or the reporting

treatm ent or therapeutic intervent ion. The event does not generally interfere 
with usual  activi ties of  daily living.
Moder ate: An adverse event that is usually alleviated with addit ional specific therapeut ic 
intervent ion. The event interferes wit h usual activit ies of daily living, causing 
discomfort but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the research 
participant.
Severe: An adverse event that interrupts usual activit ies of daily living, or significant ly 
affects clinical status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention.

CONFIDENTIAL10.2.2 Assigning Causality of AEs
The rel ationship of each AE to study  medicati on(s) will be assessed using the fo llowing 
categori es:
Related: An AE that fo llows a reasonable temporal sequence fro m administration of a 
drug (including the course after withdrawal o f the drug), or for whi ch a causal  
relationship is at least a reasonable possibilit y, ie, the relati onship cannot be 
ruled out , although factors other than the drug, such as underlying diseases, 
complicat ions, conco mitant drugs and concurrent treatments, may also be 
responsible.
Not Rel ated: An AE that does not follow a reason able tem poral  sequence from  
administration of a drug and/or that can reasonably be explained by [CONTACT_209790], such as underlying diseases, complicat ions, concomitant medicat ions 
and concurrent treatments.
In addit ion, rel ationship (causalit y) to COVID -19should be determined for all PTEs and AEs. 
The rel ationship should be assessed as related if the Invest igator considers that there is 
reasonable possibilit y that an event i s due to COVID -19. Otherwise, the relationship should be 
assessed as not related.

Drug withdrawn –a study  medicat ion is stopped due to the particular AE.
Dose not changed –the particular AE did not require stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a study  medicat ion.
Unknown – only to be used if it has not been possible to determi ne what acti on has been

Drug interrupted –the dose was interrupted due to the particular AE.
10.2.7 Outcome 
Recovered/reso lved –participant returned to first assessment status with respect to the AE.
Recovering/resolving –the inten sity is lowered by  [CONTACT_45332] m ore stages: the diagnosis has or 
signs/symptom s have alm ost disappeared; the abnormal laboratory  value improved, but has 
not returned to the normal range or to the baseline value; the participant died from a cause 
other than the particular AE wi th the condi tion remaining “recovering/resolving.”
Not recovered/not resolved –there is no change in the diagnosis, signs or symptoms; the 
intensity of the di agnosis, signs/symptoms or laboratory  value on the l ast day  of the observed 
study period has become worse than when it started; is an irreversible congenital anomaly; 
the participant died fro m another cause with the particular AE state remaining “Not 
recovered/not resolved.”
Recovered/ Reso lved wit h sequelae –the participant recovered from an acute AE but was left 
with perm anent/significant impairment (eg, recovered from a cardiovascular accident but 
with som e persist ing paresis).

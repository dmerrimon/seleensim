Title:   A Phase 2, Double-Blind, Randomized, Controlled Study to Evaluate the E fficacy and 
Safety of JointStem, Autologous Adipose Tissue Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells, in 
Treatment of Osteoarthritis  
Phase:    Phase 2 
Indication:    Osteoarthritis (Degenerative Arthritis) 
Study Objective:  T o evaluate the efficacy and safety of autologous adipose tissue derived mesenchymal stem 
cells (A dMSC) for the treatment of osteoarthritis  
 
Study Design:  This study is a  double -blind, randomized, controlled study with two arms to evaluate 
JointStem  as a treatment for subjects with osteoarthritis . Following a 2 -week screening 
period, approximately 30 subjects  will be randomly assigned into one of the following two 
arms  in a 2:1 ratio (2 JointStem : 1 positive control): 
• JointStem (1x108 cells/3mL)  
• Positive control: Synvisc -One®  
  
After each subject completes 6-month visit (Visit 6 ) and the data management team 
confirms all individual data have no issue, the individual  database will be locked and the 
blinding will be open for the statistical analysis. Only s ubjects  who are randomized to 
JointStem group will then be scheduled for 9-month and 12-month follow -up visits ( Visits 
7 and 8) .   
 Long- term follow -up visit will be conducted  to collect  long-term feedbacks (records of 
medications and treatments) following  2 years after injection for all subjects who complete  
6-month visit and accept the long -term follow -up visit .

JS-OAP2 -US01 
Version 7.0, May 14, 2018   Page 6 of 66  
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Nature Cell Co., Ltd.  Using the following three co -primary efficacy variables, the joint functional improvement of knee joint will be 
evaluated and gatekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_121318] .  
1) Change of WOMAC score from baseline at  Month 6 (JointStem group)  
It will be tested using paired t- test (one -sided test, α=0.05). If change of WOMAC score from baseline at 
Month 6 doesn’t satisfy normal distribution, Wilcoxon signed rank test will be performed.  
2) Change of VAS score from baselin e at Month 6 (JointStem group)  
It will be tested using paired t -test (one -sided test, α=0.05). If change of VAS score from baseline at Month 
6 doesn’t satisfy normal distribution, Wilcoxon signed rank test will be performed.  
3) MRI improvement evaluation at Month 6 (Joint Stem group)  
The frequency and percentage of subjects whose final PI [INVESTIGATOR_121319] ‘improvement’ will be calculated 
(validity criteria : 36% ).  
2. Secondary Endpoints  
The comparison of WOMAC score, VAS score, Lysholm Knee Scoring Scale, KOOS , IKDC and RAND -36 score 
between study and control groups will be analyzed using Analysis of Covariance (AN COVA)  with factors of treatment 
and baseline  of each variable as a covariate.  
Model -based LS Means of the differences between study and control grou ps along with 95% CI and p- value will be 
provided.  
In addition, t he change of secondary efficacy variables within study group shall be tested using paired t -test. If the 
change of score from baseline at each assessment point doesn’t satisfy  normal distribution , Wilcoxon signed rank test 
will be performed.  
In case of MRI, the frequency and percentage of subjects whose PI [INVESTIGATOR_121319] ‘improvement’ at Month [ADDRESS_136064] or Bowker’s test.  
 Safety variables will be summarized descriptively, by [CONTACT_6982].  
 When at least 15 subjects complete 6 -month visits (Visit 6, Month 6), one unblinded interim analysis can be performed 
to evaluate the efficacy and safety of JointStem without the suspension of subject ’s schedule of assessments . The 
details of this interim analysis will be presented in the statistical analysis plan.  
 All efficacy variables  and the history of treatments and medications, which are measured at a long -term follow -up 
visit (24 months after injection ) will be analyzed between treatment groups to see any long -term effects of JointStem. 
Also, MRI results of long -term follow -up visit will be compared to previous MRI results to see any long -term effects 
of JointStem.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of autologous adipose tissue derived 
mesenchymal stem cells (A dMSC) for the treatment of osteoarthritis .

CONFIDENTIAL  Nature Cell Co., Ltd.  2. BACKGROUND AND INDICATION 
 
2.1   What is Osteoarthritis  (Degenerative Arthritis)  
 Osteoarthritis  is a group of mechanical abnormalities involving degradation of joints, including 
articular cartilage and subchondral bone. Symptoms may include joint pain, tenderness, stiffness, 
locking, and sometimes an effusion. When bone surfaces become less well protected by  [CONTACT_121341], 
bone may be exposed and damaged. As a result of decreased movement secondary to pain, regional 
muscles may atrophy, and ligaments may become more lax .
Wei [ADDRESS_136074] of osteoarthritis  living with  this disease 
is approximately $5,700 annually per person.
Maetzel  2004 Osteoarthritis costs the US economy nearly 
$[ADDRESS_136075] wages and production. 
As population aging progresses and as more young people start taking up active sports, the size of 
the target patient  group is growing. 
 2.2 Current Treatment for Osteoarthritis  and Their Pi[INVESTIGATOR_121320] a unique avascular, aneural tissue that has limited capacity of self -repair once  
damaged. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_121321], treatments to manage the disease remain merely symptom-
relieving , designed  to control pain, and improve function and qualit y of life limiting adverse events. 
An effective treatment for cartilage defects is yet to be discovered.  
 Treatment generally involves a combination  of lifestyle modification, analgesics, nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatories, and joint injections with  steroids or hyaluronan (lubricant). If pain becomes 
debilitating, joint replacement surgery may be  used to improve the quality of life, e.g. partial joint 
resurfacing (hip and shoulder), and total joint  replacem ent (hip and knee) .
Conaghan 2008 Although 
various treatments are currently in use,  none of them is to address the root of cause —cartilage 
regeneration. In other words, there has been no cure  for osteoarthritis  till today.  
 As a way of regenerating the damaged or defective cartilage tissue, treatment of localized damage  
to articular cartilage using autologous chondrocytes is currently under review. A few studies are  
marketing this method of treatment named “auto logous chondrocyte transplant” .
Wysocka 2010 , Hahn 2010 
The treatment involves the extraction of healthy cartilage tissue  from the patient which is then 
cultured and transplanted into the damaged site. However, this  treatment requires the extraction of 
JS-OAP2 -US01 
Version 7.0, May 14, 2018   Page 14  of 66  
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Nature Cell Co., Ltd.  chondrocytes directly from the patient and thus causes new  damages in healthy articular cartilage. 
Also, “autologous chondrocyte transplant” cannot be applied to large lesions. Moreover, the effect 
is not satisfactory in patients over [ADDRESS_136076] that overweight is a common condition in the [LOCATION_002] , 68% of the 
American adult  population is considered either overweight or obese. Even for normal body  weight 
persons and most very lean individuals, 5- 20 mL extraction of adipose tissue is not  a problem  at 
all. Compared with marrow -derived stem cells, more people accept collecting stem cells via  
lipoaspi[INVESTIGATOR_121322]. Thirdly, AdMSC s are true stem cells with the capacity  
of differentiating into multi- lineage mesodermal cells  and possible ectodermal and endodermal  
cells.

CONFIDENTIAL  Nature Cell Co., Ltd.  Finally, autologous cells are obtained from the same  individual to whom they wi ll be re -implanted. 
Since the AdMSC s come from the patient’s own body, it  has no incidence of graft -versus-host 
rejection and less possibilities of pathogen transmission due to the donor and recipi[INVESTIGATOR_121323]. Moreover, treatments using stem cells do not cause  damage as “autologous 
chondrocyte transplant” would do to healthy artic ular cartilage, as AdMSC  treatment doesn't 
require the harvesting of healthy cartilage tissues from the patients.

Version 7.0, May 14, 2018   Page 20  of 66  
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Nature Cell Co., Ltd.  parties; the IRB must be informed in any case . Should t he clinical site be closed prematurely, all 
study materials (equipment, study medication, etc.) must be returned to the sponsor. 
 This study will discontinue  due to medical or administrative reasons such as:  
• Serious adverse events probably related to study  drug administration so that the use of study 
drug may no longer be justifiable 
• 2 or more deaths are observed during any point in the trial 
• 5 or more adverse drug reactions (NCI -CTCAE ≥ Grade 3) on the injected joint are observed 
during any point in the tr ial 
• Significant change of benefit -risk ratio for the subjects  
• Sponsor discontinues the investigation of JointStem for the treatment of osteoarthritis  or 
determines that the doses being studied are no longer justifiable 
 Possible reasons for closing of a cl inical site include the following:  
• The investigator feels that the number or severity of adverse events is excessive 
• A change of technical, administrative, or personal circumstances occurs and the conduct of the 
study no longer meets ICH-GCP guidelines 
• In case of evident, significant non-compliance to protocol or poor data quality 
 
3.5   Treatment  
 3.5.1 Treatment to be Administered  
 At Visit 2 (Week -5), a  subject, who is qualified  for this study, will be randomized to one of two 
study groups and the adipose tissue will be harvested via liposuction. At Visit 3 (Week 0, baseline), the randomized subject will receive a single intra -articular injection.  
 3.5.[ADDRESS_136079] 
 JointStem is a 5 ml syringe including AdMSCs as 1x10
8 cells/3mL  and is stable at refrigerated 
condition up to [ADDRESS_136080] completes Visit 6 ( 6-month follow-up)

 3.5.4 Selection of Dose in Study  
 The dosage of JointStem was chosen through a phase 1 and 2 study conducted in South Korea.   3.5.5 Choice of Control/Comparator 
 This study uses hyaluronic aci d as a positive control 
(Synvisc- One®). The purpose of  using this 
control is to compare the efficacy of JointStem with current treatment option based on various 
endpoints.    3.5.[ADDRESS_136082] will be assigned with one randomization code on Visit 2 (Week -5). After each subject 
completes Visit 6 (Month 6) and the data management team confirms all individual data have no 
issue, the randomization code will be open for the statistical analysis.  
 A code -break envelope for each subject including the randomization code information will be 
retained by [CONTACT_121344], revealing the randomization information, for emergency purposes only . Investigator should note that the occurrence of a SAE should not routinely 
precipi[INVESTIGATOR_121326] . An attempt to contact [CONTACT_121345]. If unblinding occurs, the subject  must be early terminated; a written explanation must 
be prepared immediately.  
 3.5.7 Prior and Concomitant Treatments  
 If the use of any concomitant treatment(s) becomes necessary, the treatment(s) must be recorded in the eCRF , including the name [CONTACT_121366], dose, route of administration, date and 
time of the treatment, and indication . In the event that concomitant medication is administered, the

The following medications /therapi[INVESTIGATOR_121327] /used  by [CONTACT_121346] (by 6 -month follow-up visit) : 
• Any pain medication for osteoarthritis except rescue medication (< acetaminophen 3.[ADDRESS_136084] resort and only for a very limited time until symptoms can be c ontrolled by [CONTACT_121347]). 
• Any other injections or invasive procedures  (including intra -articular injection s) in the affected 
joint  
• Any investigational drug (including placebo) 
• Any therapy that may affect osteoarthritis , in the judgment of the investigator  
• Lidocaine or other numbing agents while making the injection  
 After the completion of the 6- month follow -up visit, subjects may take pain medication for 
osteoarthritis and all medications will be tracked and recorded. Until the subjects c omplete the 12-
month follow -up visit, any other treatments/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_121328]  (e.g. artificial joint 
replacement surgery)  that, in the judgment of the investigator, affect the assessment of 
osteoarthritis will be prohibited.  
 3.5.8 Treatment Complian ce  
 Only  subjects  who are randomized to JointStem will return on Visits 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 ( Months 1, 3, 
6, 9 and 12) or at Early Termination.  On the other hand, subjects who are randomized to the 
positive control group will only return on Visits 4, 5 and 6 (Months 1, 3 and 6) or at Early 
Termination.

CONFIDENTIAL  Nature Cell Co., Ltd.  6. STATISTICAL METHODS AND DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE  
 
6.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans 
 
6.1.1 Analytical Populations 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Intent- to-Treat Population 
 An intent- to-treat (ITT) population will include  subjects who received the intra- articular injection 
and have at least post -injection efficacy measurements . This cohort will be evaluated for all 
efficacy variables.  
 [IP_ADDRESS] Per-Protocol Population 
 All subjects valid for ITT who complete d Visit 6 (Month 6) will be ‘valid per protocol’ (also called 
‘valid for efficacy’). Additional criteria may be added prior to unblinding the study database . As 
with the ITT population, this per -protocol (PP) cohort will also be evaluated for all efficacy 
variables.  
 [IP_ADDRESS] Safety Population 
 
Any subject who was randomized  and completed Visit 2 (Week -5) will be included in the 
evaluation of safety.   This cohort will be evaluated for all safety variables.  
 6.1.2 Treatment Group Comparability 
 
Demographic variables, medical history, treatment duration, and efficacy variables at baseline will be summarized by [CONTACT_121354]. Because, in 
theory, the goal of randomization is to ba lance out the patient characteristics, statistical tests are 
not planned for these variables.  6.1.3 Significance Level  
 
The primary efficacy hypothesis tests will be performed using a 5% significance level  (but, for the 
MRI improvement evaluation, it shall meet the validity criteria ). For the secondary efficacy 
endpoints, hypothesis tests will be performed individually at the 5% significance level. All 
hypothesis tests except for the primary efficacy hypoth esis tests will be performed with two -sided 
alternative hypotheses.

CONFIDENTIAL  Nature Cell Co., Ltd.  6.1.4 Primary Efficacy Analyses  
 
For primary efficacy endpoints , the joint functional improvement of knee joint will be evaluated 
using the following three co- primary efficacy variables  and gatekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_121332].   Three hypothesis tests will be performed in the following order: 1) Change of WOMAC score within study group, 2) Change of VAS score within study group and 3) MRI improvement 
evaluatio n in the study group. If null hypothesis is dismissed at 5% significance level for the first 
hypothesis test, the second hypothesis will also be tested at 5% significance level. The n, for MRI 
improvement evaluation, the test will be performed to confirm if the percentage of subjects whose 
final PI [INVESTIGATOR_121319] ‘improvement’ meets the validity criteria . If null hypothesis is not dismissed 
at 5% significance level  or it is lower than the validity criteria , the hypothesis test is stopped and 
it is concluded only previous item of which null hypothesis is dismissed is significant.  
 
1) Change of WOMAC score from baseline at Month 6 (JointStem group) 
 
Change of WOMAC score from baseline at Month [ADDRESS_136096] (one -
sided test, α=0.05)  with the null hypothesis equal to zero. If change of WOMAC score from 
baseline at Month 6 doesn’t satisfy normal distribution, Wilcoxon signed rank test will be 
performed.  
 
If null hypothesis is dismissed, the conclusion that the function of knee joint is improved 
from at least subjects who administer IP can be drawn.    
 2) Change of VAS score from baseline at Month 6 (JointStem group)  Change of VAS score from baseline at Month [ADDRESS_136097] (one -sided 
test, α=0.05)  with the n ull hypothesis equal to zero . If change of VAS score from baseline 
at Month 6 doesn’t satisfy normal distribution, Wilcoxon signed rank test will be performed.  
 
If null hypothesis is dismissed, the conclusion that the pain of degenerative arthritis  is 
reduced from at least subjects who administer IP can be drawn.    
 
3) MRI improvement evaluation at Month 6 (JointStem group) 
 MRI improvement evaluation will be finally analyzed through the following two steps:

CONFIDENTIAL  Nature Cell Co., Ltd.  • Radiologist will compare and analyze MRI results before and after the 
administration of IP and write a report for each subject. 
• Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_121330] (a: improvement, b: no change, c: progress) based on the radiologist’s 
report stated above.  
 
 The frequency and percentage of subjects whose final PI [INVESTIGATOR_121319] ‘i mprovement’ 
will be calculated per group.  
 
If the percentage of subjects whose final PI [INVESTIGATOR_121333] 36% , the conclusion that 
the damaged cartilage of knee joint is improved in the subjects who administer JointStem  
can be drawn.

but no adjustments for missing data and no imputation methods are planned for safety variables .  
 6.2 Determination of Sample Size  
 There was no formal sample size calculation since this is a proof -of-concept study and is not a 
hypothesis- driven study.  The number of enrolled subjects is predefined at n=30, for [ADDRESS_136106] 15 subjects complete 6 -month visits (Visit 6, Month 6), one unblinded interim 
analysis can be performed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of JointStem without the suspension of subject enrollment. The details of this interim analysis will b e presented in the statistical analysis 
plan.  No adjustment on the overall alpha -level will be made, as this is not a statistically powered 
study.  
 6.4 Long- term Follow -up Analysis  
 All efficacy variables and the history of treatments and medications, which a re measured at a long -
term follow -up visit (24 months after injection) will be analyzed between treatment groups to see 
any long -term effects of JointStem. Also, MRI results of long -term follow -up visit will be 
compared to previous MRI results to see any l ong-term effects of JointStem. The details of this 
long- term follow -up analysis will be presented in the statistical analysis plan.

CONFIDENTIAL  Nature Cell Co., Ltd.  7. SAFETY DATA COLLECTION, RECORDING, AND RE PORTING  
 
7.1 Definitions  
 
7.1.1 Adverse Events  
 
An adverse event is defined in the 21 CFR 312.32(a) as “Adverse event means any untoward 
medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related .” 
 An adverse event (also referred to as an adverse experience) can be any unfavorable and  
unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally  associated 
with the use of a drug, without any judgment about causality. An adverse event can arise from any use of the drug (e.g., off -label use, use in combination with another drug)  and from any route of 
administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose. Worsening of a pre -existing medical 
condition (e.g., diabetes, migraine headaches, and gout) after the drug administration  should be 
considered an adverse event if there is  either an increase in severity, frequency, or duration of the 
condition or an association with significantly worse outcomes.  The investigator is responsible for reviewing laboratory test results and determining whether an abnormal value in an individual study subject represents a change from baseline values . Abnormal 
laboratory findings without clinical significance (based on the investigator's judgment) should not be recorded as adverse events; however, laboratory value changes requiring therapy or adjus tment 
in prior therapy are considered adverse events.  
 Adverse events will be reviewed continuously throughout the study.  7.1.2 Serious Adverse Events  
 A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as an adverse event that  
• is fatal  
• is life threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death)  
• requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• other significant medical hazard  
 
JS-OAP2 -US01 
Version 7.0, May 14, 2018   Page 42  of 66  
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Nature Cell Co., Ltd.  Life threatening:  The term life -threatening in the definition of ‘serious’ refers to an AE in which 
the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event . It does not see an AE that hypothetically 
might have caused death if it were more severe.  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]: Any adverse event leading to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_121334] ‘serious’, UNLESS at least one of the following exceptions is met:  
• the admission results in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8932] 12 hours OR 
• the admission  is pre -planned (i.e., elective or scheduled surgery arranged prior to the start 
of the study) OR 
• a medical intervention that requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (e.g.,  blood product transfusion or 
central line insertion ) will be not considered a serious adverse event  
 However, it should be noted that invasive treatment during any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_113276] ‘medically important’ and as such may be reportable as a SAE dependent on clinical 
judgment.    Disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions.  Important medical event: Any AE may be considered serious because it may jeopardize the patient 
and may require intervention to prevent another serious condition. As guidance for determination 
of importa nt medical events see the ‘WHO Adverse Reaction Terminology – Critical Terms List’ . 
These terms either see or might be indicative of a serious disease state.  
 Such reported events warrant special attention because of their possible association with a serious disease state and may lead to more decisive action than reports on other terms.  7.2 Reporting Procedures for All Adverse Events  
 The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all adverse events (as defined in Section 7.1) observed by [CONTACT_121355]’s medical records and reported on the e CRF.  
 Documentation must be supported by [CONTACT_36927]’s file . A laboratory test abnormality 
considered clinically relevant, e.g., causing the subject to withdraw from the study, requiring treatment or causing apparent clinical manifestations, or judged relevant by [CONTACT_093], should be reported as an adverse event . Each event should be described in detail along with start 
and stop dates, severity, relationship to investigational product, action taken, and outcome  
JS-OAP2 -US01 
Version 7.0, May 14, [ADDRESS_136107] be assigned by [CONTACT_093]:  adverse event diagnosis or syndrome(s) (if known, signs or symptoms if not known); event description (with detail appropriate to the event); dates of onset and resolution; severi ty; assessment of relatedness 
to study drug and action taken . The investigator may be asked to provide follow -up information, 
discharge summaries, and extracts from medical records or eCRFs.  
 If applicable, the relationship of the adverse event to the study drug will be assessed by [CONTACT_121356]: “ Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_50464]?”  The investigator should respond to this question with either Yes or No.  7.2.2 Adverse Event Severity  
 The severity of adverse events should be graded as follows: 
• Mild – Usually transient in nature and generally not interfering with normal activities  
• Moderate – Sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal activities  
• Severe – Prevents normal activities  
 Medically significant adverse events considered related to the study drug by [CONTACT_121357].  It will be left to the investigator’s clinical judgment to determine whether an adverse event is related and of sufficient severity to require the subject’s removal from treatment or from the study . 
A subject may also voluntarily withdraw from treatment due to what he or she perceives as an intolerable adverse event . If either of these situations arises, the subject should be strongly 
encouraged to undergo an end-of- study assessment and be under medical supervision until 
symptoms cease or the condition becomes stable.  7.[ADDRESS_136108] immediately (within 24 hours of the 
investigator’s awareness) be reported to the person/parties as detailed in the  study file . A Serious 
Adverse Event form must also be completed within 1 day of the investigator’s awareness and 
JS-OAP2 -US01 
Version 7.0, May 14, 2018   Page 44  of 66  
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Nature Cell Co., Ltd.  forwarded to the  designated person/parties as detailed in the study file . Each Serious Adverse 
Event must be followed up until resolution or stabilization by [CONTACT_121358]/parties.  
 Serious adverse events also will be collected an d reported within [ADDRESS_136109] to the sponsor thirty days in advance of submission in order to obtain approval prior to submission of the final version for publication. This will be reviewed promptly 
and approval will not be withheld unreasonably . In case of a difference of opi[INVESTIGATOR_121335](s), the contents of the publication will be discussed in order to find a solution that satisfies both parties.  
 The investigator is encouraged to participate in the evaluation of the data for scientific purposes but is expected to work with the sponsor in the development of any scientific presentation or publication. Since the sponsor authors will be included, it is expected that all co- authors of the 
manuscripts will have an opportunity for feedback in the content and conclusions . The technical 
and editorial resources of the sponsor will be available to assist in the development of abstracts, presentations, and publications regarding this study and it is expected that drafts will be sent to the 
sponsor with adequate time for input and revisions prior to submission.

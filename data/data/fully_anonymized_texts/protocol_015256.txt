Title: 
A Phase I/II, Randomized, Double-blind, Comparator-cont rolled, Dose-escalation Study to Evaluate the Safety, 
Pharmacokinetics, and Efficacy of TLC590 for Postsurgical Pain Management Following Inguinal Hernia 
Repair 
Investigational Product : 
TLC590 (Ropi[INVESTIGATOR_40494]) 
Study Centers: 
Approximately 2 centers in the [LOCATION_002] (US) 
Phase: 
Phase I/II  
Objectives: 
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of TLC590 for postsurgical pain 
management in subjects with inguinal hernia repair surgery. 
The secondary objectives of this study are: • To evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile and dose-exposure relationship of TLC590, as well as the 
bioavailability as compared with Naropin
®. 
• To evaluate analgesic efficacy of TLC590 compared with Naropin® for postsurgical pain management in 
subjects with inguinal hernia repair surgery. 
• To evaluate the exposure-response relationship be tween PK parameters and pain management. 
Study Design: 
This is a Phase I/II, ran domized, double-blind, comparator-controlled, dose-escalation study to assess the safety, 
PK, and efficacy of single postsurgical app lication of TLC590 compared with Naropin® via a single infiltrative 
local administration in adult subjects following inguinal hernia repair surgery. 
The study will enroll approximately 64 evaluable subjects  who meet all entry criteria across 4 cohorts. 
Approximately 16 subjects will be enrolled  to each cohort in a 3:1 ratio. Each  cohort will comprise 12 subjects 
receiving a dose of TLC590 and 4 subjects receiving active co mparator drug (Naropin® 150 mg; [0.5%, 
5 mg/mL]) in accordance with the randomization sche dule (as assigned by a centralized interactive web 
response system [IWRS]) and dose-escalation scheme outlined in the following table. 
Cohort TLC590 Naropin® 
Cohort 1 (N = 16)  N = 12:  TLC590; 190 mg (10  mL) N = 4:  Naropin®; 150 mg (30 mL)  
Cohort 2 (N = 16)  N = 12:  TLC590; 380 mg (20  mL) N = 4:  Naropin®; 150 mg (30 mL) 
Cohort 3 (N = 16)  N = 12:  TLC590; 570 mg (30  mL) N = 4:  Naropin®; 150 mg (30 mL) 
Cohort 4 (N = 16)  N = 12:  TLC590; 760 mg (40  mL) OR 
N = 12:  TLC590; 475 mg (25  mL); if 
the TLC590 570  mg (30 mL) dose is not 
tolerated  N = 4:  Naropin®; 150 mg (30 mL) 
Dose escalation of a single postsurgical administration of TLC590 will be performed using sequential dose 
levels starting at 190 mg up to 760 mg, as compared with Naropin® 150 mg (5 mg/mL) via infiltrative local 
administration in adult subjects following unilateral Lichtenstein inguinal hernia repair surgery. Dose escalation

13 December 2018 (Amendment 03) CONFIDENTIAL Page 5 of 64 will be determined by [CONTACT_727211]-related adverse events and all serious AEs (SAEs) by a safety 
monitoring committee (SMC); PK data will also be reviewed  only by [CONTACT_727212] (unbound) ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]. 
Number of Subjects:  
Approximately 64 evaluable subjects in up to 4 cohorts of  approximately 16 subjects per cohort will be enrolled 
in this study.  
Treatment: 
At the end of the surgery, prior to wound closure, a si ngle infiltrative local dose of blinded study medication will 
be administered. 
Study Duration: 
The study duration will be approximately [ADDRESS_992889] will be followed for 30 days.

13 December 2018 (Amendment 03) CONFIDENTIAL Page 8 of 64 Statistical Analysis: 
No formal sample size calculation will be performed, but r ather, the number of subjects per cohort is based on 
previous experience with other drugs for first-in- human trials and is generally considered adequate for 
determination of tolerability and PK characterization. 
NPRS scores following rescue analgesics will be imputed by [CONTACT_727213]. 
The worst NPRS score prior to each rescue analgesic will be carried forward within the following 4-hour 
window. If the pain intensity score for the windowed observation is higher than the worst observed score, it will not be replaced. Missing NPRS scores w ill be imputed via the last observation carried forward (LOCF) using the last 
observed scores. Sensitivity analyses on NPRS related endpoints will be performed by [CONTACT_727214]. The NPRS scores just prio r to the rescue analgesics will be carried forward for 
all subsequent scheduled assessments.  
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) or a Kruskal-Wallis test (if the normality assumption is not met) will be used to 
assess the overall difference among treatments for NPRS at rest and with movement, AUC of NPRS at rest and 
with movement, the total postoperative consumption of resc ue analgesics, and the average daily rescue analgesic 
consumption.  
The Kaplan-Meier method will be used to analyze time to the first postoperative use of rescue analgesic, and 
time to the first postoperative use of rescue opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]. Comp arison of the survival curves among treatments will be 
assessed by a log-rank test. 
Chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test w ill be used to assess the overall differences among treatments for the 
proportions of subject who are opi[INVESTIGATOR_39895], subjects who used no rescue analgesics, and subjects who used no 
postoperative antiemetic therapy, and PGA. 
All the exploratory endpoints will be summarized descriptively.  Blood concentrations of ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] (unbound and total)  will be descriptively summarized at each scheduled 
time of PK sampling by [CONTACT_3148]. PK parameter s will be derived by [CONTACT_105]-compartmental analysis. 
The dose-exposure relationship of TLC590 will be evaluated by [CONTACT_727215] C
max parameters 
obtained from each dose level and displayed graphically.  The power model will be used to investigate the dose 
proportionality for subjects who received the TL C590 treatment.  The r elative systemic bioavailability 
(including relative AUC and C max) compared to Naropin® will be analyzed by [CONTACT_2329] a general linear model 
(GLM). Exposure-response relationship between PK parame ters and NPRS scores will be displayed graphically 
and will be evaluated accordingly 
Safety analysis will be based on all safety info rmation collected including physical examination, surgical site 
assessment, vital signs assessments, clinical laboratory data, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), AEs, and SAEs.

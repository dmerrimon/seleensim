Moderate or severe aortic stenosis (AS ) affects 2.8 % of people aged ≥ [ADDRESS_809467] common valvular disorders worldwide(1). Without intervention, severe AS carri es an 
extremely poor prognosis with a 1 and 5 year survival of ~60% and ~30%, respectively(2,3). 
Surgical and transcatheter aortic valve replacement (AVR) are to- date the only interventions that 
have been shown to improve morbidity and mortality in this population(4,5). However, there is 
heterogeneity in clinical course after AVR; even after a successful procedure, some patients show 
minimal symptomatic or hemodynamic improvement(6).   
Symptoms in aortic stenosis result from an inability of the left ventricle (LV) to overcome the 
systolic load caused by a fixed outflow obstruction. After correction of the stenotic valve, residual 
LV afterload results primarily from arterial load and is associated  with poor outcomes. Indeed, 
higher pulsatile arterial load after AVR is significantly associated with mortality(7). An important 
component of pulsatile load is the magnitude of wave reflections in the arterial tree(8,9). Wave 
reflections arise in peripheral arterial sites and travel back to the heart, arriving while the LV is still 
ejecting blood, increasing the late systolic workload of the LV. Wave reflections are highly 
sensitive to nitric oxide ( NO).  
The increased LV afterload  during systole results in myocyte hypertrophy and increased wall 
thickness  that is accompanied by a diffuse interstitial fibrosis in the myocardium(10). In fact, the 
amount of myocardial fibrosis, as determined by [CONTACT_610508], is an independent 
predictor of LV function improvement and late all -cause mortality after aortic valve replacement 
(6). However, m yocardial fibrosis does not appear to regress significantly after aortic valve 
replacement(11,12). This  suggests  that arterial factors  play a role in the pathogenesis and 
maintenance of fibrosis even after AVR. This additionally indicates that persistent myocardial 
fibrosis may contribute to poor quality of life after AVR. Thus, reducing fibrosis, by [CONTACT_610509], may be an effective strategy towards improving quality of life and 
exercise capacity in patients after aortic valve replacement for severe aortic stenosis.  
Prior  data demonstrates that a single oral dose of inorganic nitrate reduces late  systolic load in 
other populations . Dietary nitrate increases plasma nitrite, an  endothelium -independent source of 
the potent vasodilator nitric oxide (NO). Thus, augmentation of the nitrate -nitrite -NO pathway has 
the potential for chronic “disease- modifying” benefits in aortic stenosis. Therefore, nitrate 
supplementation represents a  logical intervention to improve exercise capacity and quality of life 
in aortic stenosis.  
The current trial is  designed to assess the safety and efficacy of sustained oral administration of 
inorganic nitrate in patients with severe aortic stenosis and to  assess the mechanisms by [CONTACT_610510]. This is a  
randomized double- blind cross over clinical trial, in which 22 subjects who underwent surgical or 
transcatheter AVR for  severe AS  three or more months prior to enrollment will receive  the 
following 2 interventions, in randomized order : (1) Potassium nitrate ( KNO 3), at a dose of 12- 18 
mmol/d by [CONTACT_5555] 4  ± 1 weeks, or; (2) Potassium chloride (KCl) , at a dose of 12- 18 mmol/d by 
[CONTACT_5555] 4 ± 1 weeks . A 1 -week  ± [ADDRESS_809468] the safety of KNO 3 and its efficacy on a number 
of clinical and physiologic endpoints in subjects who underwent AVR for s evere AS .  
PULSE AS V3  -  02-Aug -2018  
Confidential and Proprietary Information of the Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania  5 Our specific aims are:  
Specific Aim 1 : To assess whether KNO [ADDRESS_809469] clinical 
relevance: aerobic capacity and quality of life (QOL)  
Hypothesis 1a: KNO 3 will improve exercise capacity, quantified as : (1) Total w ork 
performed during a maximal -effort exercise test; (2) P eak oxygen consumption (VO 2) 
during a symptom -limited maximal effort  exercise test . These will be the co -primary 
endpoint s of the trial.  
 
Hypothesis 1b: KNO 3 will improve QOL, assessed using the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy 
Questionnaire.  
 
Specific Aim 2:  To dissect the effects of KNO 3 on specific physiologic adaptations to exercise  
Hypothesis 2a: KNO [ADDRESS_809470].  
 
Hypotheses 2b: Since nitrates may exert venodilating effects and/or myocardial effects, 
we will test the hypotheses that KNO 3 impacts LV diastolic filling parameters  (measured 
with echoc ardiography at rest and after peak exercise) and improves myocardial strain  
(assessed with speckle- tracking echocardiography).  
 
Specific Aim 3 : To assess whether KNO [ADDRESS_809471] reflections  
(assessed via comprehensive aortic pressure- flow relations, using arterial tonometry and Doppler 
echocardiography).  
This t rial has the potential to establish a novel, inexpensive, and readily implementable 
therapeutic paradigm for post-AVR patients  and t o characterize specific mechanisms involved, 
enhancing ou r understanding of this disease.

3. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
Calcific  aortic stenosis (AS) occurs in 3 -5% of  people in the [LOCATION_002] aged ≥ 75 years(13). 
Without intervention, severe AS carries an extremely poor prognosis with a 1 and 5 year survival 
of ~60% and ~30%, respectively(2,3). Surgical and transcatheter aortic valve replacement (AVR) 
are currently the only interventions that have been shown to improve morbidit y and mortality in 
this population(4,5). Over the last decade, TAVR has been shown to r esult in a dramatic 
improvement of survival and quality of life for many patients who were deemed to be inoperable 
candidates for SAVR(4,5). However, there is heterogeneity in clinical course after AVR;  even after 
a successful procedure, some patients show minimal symptomatic or hemodynamic 
improvement(6).  Among the extreme risk cohort of patients in the CoreValve US Pi[INVESTIGATOR_16076], 39% 
of patients had a poor outcome 6 months after TAVR with 22% dying, 6% having poor quality of 
life by [CONTACT_610511] 1.4% with with a decline in their quality of life after the procedure(14). This was 
redemonstrated i n reports from the PARTNER trial , in which 35% of patients had a poor outcome 
at [ADDRESS_809472] -procedure,  with 19% subsequently dying and 16% with poor quality of life(15). 
This suggests an unmet need to identify and intervene upon physiologic abnormalities in patients 
who do not benefit from TAVR.  
There are a number of factors that determine a patient ’s functional health status after AVR. Given 
the relative advanced age of patients who undergo TAVR, it should come as no surprise that 
presence of co- morbidities and overall frailty, in addition to age  and gender, are critical. An 
analysis of patients from the PARTNER trial identified a number of significant pre- procedure risk 
factors that were predictive of poor outcomes after TAVR. Poor functional capacity , measured by 
[CONTACT_201298]-Minute Walk  Test ( 6MWT ) and lower mean aortic valve radients were the most predictive; 
other predictors were renal dysfunction, oxygen- dependent lung disease, and poor baseline 
cognitive function(16).  There are also clear cardiac and systemic hemodynamic characteristics 
that are associated with poor outcomes after AVR. Low-gradient AS and tricuspid valve 
regurgitation were shown to be associated with all- cause [ADDRESS_809473] -procedure mortality; 
severe mitral regurgitation and moderate/severe postprocedural aortic regurgitation appear to be 
independent predictors of poor response to treatment(17). Higher pulsatile arterial load after aortic 
valve repair is significantly associated with mortality(7).  
Symptoms in aortic stenosis result from an inability of the left ventricle to overcome the systolic 
load caused by a fixed outflow obstruction. Left ventricle ( LV) afterload in patients with sever e AS 
can be conceptualized as a series circuit with additive contributions by [CONTACT_610512](8,9,18). After correction of the stenotic valve, residual LV afterload results 
primarily from arterial load and is associated with poor outcomes. Indeed, higher pulsatile arterial 
load after AVR is significantly associated with mortality(7). An important component of pulsatile 
load is the magnitude of wave reflections in the arterial tree(8,9). Wave reflections arise in 
peripheral arterial sites and travel back to the heart, arriving while the LV is s till ejecting blood, 
increasing the late systolic workload of the LV. Available evidence causally link late systolic load 
with LV remodeling, diastolic dysfunction, and HF risk. Wave reflections are highly sensitive to 
NO.  
The increased LV afterload durin g systole results in myocyte hypertrophy and increased wall 
PULSE AS V3  -  02-Aug -2018  
Confidential and Proprietary Information of the Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania  8 thickness, which allows the ejection fraction to be maintained by [CONTACT_610513](19). 
This myocyte growth is accompanied by a diffuse interstitial fibrosis in the myocardium, as 
fibroblasts increase collagen synthesis in response to the elevated intraventricular pressures(10). 
In fact, the amount of myocardial fibrosis, as determined by [CONTACT_610514], is an 
independent predictor of LV function improvement and late all -cause mortality after aortic valve 
replacement(6). However, myocardial fibrosis does not appear to regress significantly after aortic 
valve replacement(11,12). This  suggests that nonvalvular factors may play a role in the 
pathogenesis and maintenance of fibrosis even after AVR.  
Our trial will test a novel intervention (inorganic nitrate) to modify key physiologic abnormalities 
(arterial vasodilator reserve and late systolic LV load from arterial wave reflections), which have 
the potential for both immediate- term improvements in exercise tolerance and long -term “disease -
modifying” effects. The trial is designed to address the safety and potential clinical benefit of this 
approach in severe aor tic stenosis  using endpoints with direct clinical relevance, and also to 
characterize the specific physiologic mechanisms involved. This will potentially identify a new 
therapeutic paradigm and a readily implementable therapeutic intervention.

5.1. Initial Visit   
During the baseline study visit, inclusion and exclusion criteria will be reviewed to ensure subject 
suitability. After eligibility has  been confirmed, written informed consent will be obtained from the 
subject  using Institutional Review Board (IRB) -approved documents. Informed consent will be 

PULSE AS V3  -  02-Aug -[ADDRESS_809480] will be performed in women with child-
bearing potential. Blood will be collected for measurement of (a) comprehensive metabolic panel; 
(b) complete blood count;  (d) methemoglobin. A pregnancy test (for women of childbearing 
potential) and G lucose- 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G 6PD) deficiency screening (for males of 
males of African, Asian or Mediterranean decent) will be performed as needed. Blood, urine,  and 
saliva samples will be collected and frozen for nitrate/nitrite  and biomarker  level determination.  
The Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) will be administered. Subjects will  also 
be given an informational brochure regarding foods that are high in nitrate/nitrite and thus should 
be avoided during the study.   
Echocardiography will then be performed using a standardized protocol. Images will be obtained 
from the parasternal long axis, short axis, api[INVESTIGATOR_2855] 5- , 4-, 3-, and 2- chamber, subcostal, and 
suprasternal views for offline analysis  of myocardial strain. Dedicated ventricular chamber images 
will be obtained in the 4-  and [ADDRESS_809481]  (LVOT) will be performed in the api[INVESTIGATOR_2855] 5- chamber view.  
Concurrent arterial tonometry will be performed using a high -fidelity tonometer at the carotid, 
femoral, and radial arteries , using a Sphygmocor device. Waveforms will be calibrated using the 
brachial artery blood pressures , obtained using a validated osci llometric device. Waveforms will 
be digitally -stored for off -line analysis. Where available, we will also measure blood pressure 
using a BP+ device (Uscom , Sydney, Australia)  , which is an FDA -approved device that measures 
brachial and central blood pressure using a standard brachial blood pressure cuff. Body surface 
measurements will be made to determine distance between the suprasternal notch to the carotid, 
radial, and femoral arteries. A [ADDRESS_809482] will also be performed during this visit. Patients 
who demonstrate significant desaturation during exercise ≤94% or a fall in Spo2 ≥5%) will be 
discontinued from the study  at this timepoint.

5.2. Randomization procedure  
A blocked randomization will be performed. E ach block will contain an equal number of allocations 
to KNO 3 followed by [CONTACT_610519] 3. The order of treatment sequences within 
each block will be randomized.  
5.3. Intervention Phase 1  
Subjects will be randomized to receive either active drug (KNO 3) or control (KCl) as the “first” drug 
for phase A. The initial dose will be one 6 mmol capsule administered twice daily , to be taken with 
meals . We will provide subjects with a 14- day supply of  study medication to account for potential 
delays in receiving  the 2nd batch of medication (i.e., after the 1- week call).  
1-week call: Subjects will be called by [CONTACT_756] ~[ADDRESS_809484]’s baseline, the drug dose will be up titrat ed to 
18 mmol daily (One 6- mmol capsule taken 3 times per day ). The presence of orthostatic 
symptoms  (i.e. sustained lightheadedness upon standing)  will prompt a visit to assess for 
orthostatic vital signs. The presence of symptomatic orthostatic hypotensi on (20 mmHg reduction 
in systolic blood pressure with associated symptoms such as dizziness) measured at this 
subsequent assessment visit will prompt exclusion of patients from the trial.  
 
For subjects who have a serum K at the initial visit between 4.7 and 5.0 mEq/L in the presence of 
either: (a) potassium -sparing diuretic use, or (b) Estimated glomerular filtration rate of 30 -39 
mL/min/1.73m2, we will check a serum potassium 1 week after the implementation of  the 18 
mmol/d dose as a safety m easure . A serum potassium >  5.5 mEq/L will prompt exclusion at this 
point.  
 
At [ADDRESS_809485] at the endpoint visit . 
 
Phase 1 endpoint assessment:  Following 4 ± 1 weeks of therapy with KNO 3/KCl, subjects will 
return for endpoint assessment s. Physical examination with measurement of orthostatic blood 
pressure , KCCQ, dietary counseling , and side effect assessment s will be performed.  A urine 
pregnancy test will be performed in women with child- bearing potential. An intravenous catheter 
will be placed in the antecubital vein and securely fixed in place. Blood, urine  and saliva samples 
will be collected prior to, and approximately [ADDRESS_809486] . Blood RNA sample s will be collected prior to the 
PULSE AS V3  -  02-Aug -2018  
Confidential and Proprietary Information of the Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania  14 morning dose administration using Paxgene tubes (BD Biosciences , Franklin Lakes, NJ ). 
Subjects will then undergo repeat echoc ardiography , arterial tonometry  and blood pressure 
measurements (including BP+ central blood pressure measurements) . Subjects will then perform 
a maximal -effort peak oxygen consumption (VO 2) test using a supi[INVESTIGATOR_610482]. Cardiac output at rest will  be measured immediately prior to exercise using 
pulsed wave Doppler echocardiography . Flow -mediated dilation of the brachial artery to assess 
endothelial function will be performed (Unex Co. Ltd., Nagoya, Japan).  An additional blood sample

Subjects will be instructed to take the medication as re quired by [CONTACT_760], and compliance will 
be assessed via pi[INVESTIGATOR_610484] .   
Subjects will be instructed to return unused capsules at the end of each treatment phase. A pi[INVESTIGATOR_610485]. Ret urned trial capsules will be 
stored separately from the non- allocated trial capsules until returned trial capsules are disposed 
of. The IDS personnel will keep track of all received, used, partly used and unused trial products.  
Used and unused study drug w ill be destroyed at the instruction of the sponsor . A copy of the 
drug destruction SOP should be maintained in the pharmacy section of the Regulatory Binder.  
Study drug should not be destroyed until drug accountability has been completed.   
6.1. Rules for  un-blinding  
Randomization data will be kept strictly confidential, accessible only to authorized IDS personnel, 
until the time of un- blinding.  The investigators will be given access to the treatment code for their 
patients for emergency un- blinding by [CONTACT_3379] t he IDS. This is considered to be a very unlikely 
occurrence. Any suspected study drug- related events will be treated as though the patient 
received active (KNO 3). Nevertheless, in the rare event of necessary un- blinding, the site PI [INVESTIGATOR_610486] r must be notified .   
 
7. ADVERSE EVENTS 
7.1. Key definitions  
Adverse Event:  An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the 
use of a drug in a subject whether or not considered drug or biologic related. An AE can therefore 
be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom or disease temporally associated with the use 
of the pharmaceutical product.  
Suspected Adverse Reaction: A suspected adverse reaction (SAR) is any adverse event for which 
there is a reasonable possibility that t he drug caused the event. “Reasonable possibility” suggests 
there is a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event. “Suspected adverse 
reaction” implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means 
any adverse event caused by a drug 
Serious Adverse Events (SAE):  An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered 
serious if the investigator or sponsor believes any of the following outcomes may occur:  
• Death 
• Life-threatening AE:  Places the subject at  immediate risk of death at the time of the event 
as it occurred. It does not include an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might 
have caused death.  
• Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct norma l 
life functions.  
PULSE AS V3  -  02-Aug -2018  
Confidential and Proprietary Information of the Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania  18 • Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_318].  
• Congenital anomaly or birth defect.  
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse event when, based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition above.  
This determination is based on the opi [INVESTIGATOR_610487]  (e.g., if either 
believes it is serious, it must be considered serious).  
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (ADE): Any serious adverse effect on health or safety, 
any life -threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with a device, if that effect, 
problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the 
application; or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to 
the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.  
7.2. Classification of AE /ADE s regarding causal relationship to study interventions and 
severity  
A medically -qualified investigator must assess all AEs in terms of causal relationship to 
intervention, severity, and “expectedness” using the following guidelines : 
Classification of Adverse Events for Causal Relationship to Study Interventions  
Not related  There is not a reasonable causal relationship to the investigational 
product and the adverse event  
Unlikely related  No temporal association or the cause of the event has been identified, or 
the drug or device cannot be implicated.  
Possibly related:  There is reasonable evidence to suggest a causal relationship between 
the drug and adverse event.  
Related  
 There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and the influence of 
other factors is unlikely.  
 
Classification of Adverse Events Regarding Severity  Scale  
1 Mild AE. Awareness of sign, symptom, or event, but easily tolerated ; no treatment 
required  
2  Moderate AE. Discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activity and may 
warrant intervention. In the latter scenario, AE responds to treatment  
3 Severe AE. Incapacitating , limiting usual /normal  activities or significantly affects 
clinical status  requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_318].  
4 Life-threatening or disabling  
5 Fatal AE  
PULSE AS V3  -  02-Aug -2018  
Confidential and Proprietary Information of the Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania  19  
Expectedness:  The expectedness of an AE /ADE  or SAR shall be determined according to the 
specified reference document containing safety information (e.g., most current investigator’s 
brochure or product label). Any AE /ADE  that is not identified in nature, severity, or specificity in 
the current study reference document(s) (e.g.  protocol or  investigator’s brochure) is considered 
unexpected. Events that are mentioned in the investigator's brochure as occurring with a class of 
drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but not specifically 
mentioned as occurring w ith the particular drug under investigation are considered unexpected.  
The following AEs are expected, disease -related events in patients post-transcatheter or surgical 
AVR (84).  
• Unplanned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], ER visit or clinic visit  
• Arrhythmias  
• Permanent pacemaker implantation  
• Sudden cardiac death  
• Acute coronary syndrome 
• Cerebrovascular event  
• Paravalvular aortic regurgitation 
• Wound dehiscence  
• Infective endocarditis  
• Aortic dissection  
• Sternal infection  
• Thromboembolism  
 
The following are potential expected side effects of KNO3:  
• Stomach discomfort  
• Slight headache  
• Dizziness  
• Lightheadedness  
• Low blood pressure  
• Stomach Ache, diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting 
• Shortness of breath  
• Flushing  
• Rash  
• Mild orthostatic hypotension 
• Clinically significant methemoglobinemia or significant symptomatic orthostatic 
hypotension (20 mmHg or greater reduction in systolic blood pressure with 
associated symptom such as dizziness) are potential side effects, although we will 
consider them unexpected given prior data in this patient population with this 
particular drug and dosing scheme.  
7.3. Recording and Reporting of Adverse Events  
The site PI [INVESTIGATOR_610488] V3  -  02-Aug -2018  
Confidential and Proprietary Information of the Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania  20 subjects following each visit and at the end of their participation. The site PI [INVESTIGATOR_610489], followed and reported to the IRB, Sponsor (at 
psom -[EMAIL_11613] ) and IND  Medical  Director  as appropriate.  
SAEs  occurring from the time of signed informed consent  to the final study  visit will be captured 
on the SAE eCRF. AEs will be classified according to the guidelines/definitions specified in section 
7 of the protocol. Any AE rated ≥ 3 in severity (i.e., SAE) must be reported by [CONTACT_610521] [ADDRESS_809494] yearly.  
Events significant enou gh to necessitate modification of study drug dosing will be captured on an 
appropriate eCRF module (“Study Drug Dosing” page).  Should the PI [INVESTIGATOR_610490], the PI [INVESTIGATOR_397904].  
7.4. Follow -up 
The Investigator will record safety follow -up information according to the same process used for 
reporting the initial event as described above. The Investigator will follow all reportable events 
until resolution, stabilization or the event is otherwise explained.  
7.5. Management of Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction  
AEs that meet the criteria of serious, related to study intervention, and unexpected for the study 
intervention, qualify for expedited reporting by [CONTACT_610522]. The Site 
Investigator wi ll assess all SAEs and evaluate for “unexpectedness” and relationship to study 
drug. The Site Investigator is required to complete a report for any events identified as serious, 
study drug related and unexpected, using the CIOMS format.  The sponsor will submit a voluntary 
CIOMS form . See Section 7.[ADDRESS_809495] discontinued from the trial, but 
the pregnancy will be followed until final outcome. Any associated AEs or SAEs that occur to the 
PULSE AS V3  -  02-Aug -2018

8. STUDY MEASUREMENTS AND DATA COLLECTION  
8.1. Assessment of exercise capacity  
We will use a supi[INVESTIGATOR_610491] (VO 2) during exercise. Subjects will perform a maximal exertion- limited 
exercise test using a graded- exercise protocol. We will use a supi[INVESTIGATOR_610492] (Stress Echo Ergometer 1505, Medical Positioning, Inc, Kansas City, 
MO). Subjects will undergo expi[INVESTIGATOR_610493] a Parvo Medics True One 2400 device 
(Parvo Medics, Sandy, UT), an Innocor device (Innovision Inc) or equivalent. Resistance began 
at 15 W for 3 minutes, increasing to 25 W for 3 minutes, and then increasing by 25 W every 3 
minutes thereafter. Breath- by-breath information will be recorded. We will use custom -designed 
software already developed in Matlab (MathWorks, Natick, MA) at our lab for offline processing 
and quantification of all exercise data.(85) All data quantification will be blinded to treatment. Total 
work performed will be computed and exercise efficiency will be defined as (total work/total 
oxygen consumed). Exercise efficiency is not a formal endpoint of the trial, but will be used to 
interpret changes in the co- primary outcomes.  After these exercises, we will use a device that 
uses Near Infrared Spectroscopy [NIRS]  to measure the oxygen levels in the left calf and forearm 
muscles (Portamon and Portalite devices, Artemis, Netherlands).  
8.2. Quality of life  
Quality of life will be assessed with the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnair e (KCCQ).(86) 
We will administer the KCCQ to subjects prior to randomization and at the end of each intervention 
phase (6 -week time point in bot h phases). This is a validated 23- item questionnaire that assess 
physical function, symptoms, social function, self -efficacy and knowledge, and quality of life. It 
has been used extensively in heart failure studies (http://cvoutcomes.org/pages/3214 ) 
8.3. Doppler Echocardiography  
This procedure is similar to clinical cardiac echocardiograms. An ultrasound probe will be placed 
on the surface of the skin to obtain images of the heart. This takes approximately 20 minutes. 
This will occur at all three visits.  
Measurement of LV filling and myocardial strain: given that inorganic nitrate may also induce 
venodilation and myocardial effects, we will also assess the effects of potassium nitrate on (1) 
Early mitral annul ar early diastolic tissue velocity; (2) The ratio of early diastolic mitral inflow 
velocity to mitral annular tissue velocity (a surrogate of LV filling pressures); (3) Peak early 
diastolic intraventricular pressure gradient, a marker of ventricular relaxation, assessed with color 
M-mode interrogations of mitral inflow.(87,88) We note that the latter is not simply based on the 
inflow propagation velocity, but rather on solving Euler momentum equation.(87) This method is 
able to accurately assess LV rel axation(87). Systolic function will be assessed via sys tolic 
PULSE AS V3  -  02-Aug -2018  
Confidential and Proprietary Information of the Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania  22 myocardial strain (using speckle tracking echocardiography), which we have successfully applied 
in previous studies.(66,69,89) 
8.4. Measurement of late systolic load and arterial wave reflections:  
We will use a high -fidelity Millar applanation tonometer(54) to record carotid pressure waveforms, 
which will be calibrated using brachial artery pressures. Central arterial tonometric recordings and 
Doppler flow velocity files will be processed off -line using custom -designed software written in 
Matlab (The Mathworks, Natick, MA) as previously described.(66,90) We have successfully 
implemented this method in multiple previous studies(8,57,66,67,91) and have published a tutorial 
detailing our analysis methods.(8,53) After signal -averaging of pressure and flow, time alignment of 
carotid pres sure and LV outflow curves will be performed to maximize concordance of the rapid 
systolic upstroke of pressure and flow, concordance of the dicrotic notch and cessation of flow, 
zero value of the phase angle of higher -frequency harmonics (7th to 10th) of input impedance, and 
linearity of the early systolic pressure -flow relationship.(90) After computation of aortic input 
impedance, proximal aortic cha racteristic impedance (Zc) will be computed in the frequency 
domain as previously described.(90) Pressure and flow harmonics were separated into forw ard and 
backward components using standard wave separation analysis .(8,53,90,92) The sum of forward and 
backward pressure harmonics yields the forward and backward waves, respectively. We will 
assess the reflection coefficient in the first 3 harmonics. A reflection coefficient ( Γ ) is derived from 
the ratio of two sine waves, it is a complex number with an amplitude and phase- angle, which can 
correspond to different degrees  of destructive or constructive interference between forward and 
backward waves. Therefore, the net -effect of reflections will be expressed as the real part of  Γ, 
which becomes increasingly positive as pressure from wave reflections increases (constructive 
interference), and negative when destructive interference leads to a net decrease in pressure by 
[CONTACT_610523] a given harmonic.(93) Since all harmonics of wave reflection contribute variably 
to systolic LV load, our primary measure of late systolic load will be the net pressure related to 
wave reflections during ejection in the time domain, which better represents the impact of 
reflections on LV afterload. We will first compute the product of flow and aortic Zc (QZc product), 
which represents the pressure resulting from the interaction of blood flow with aortic root Zc.(8,54)  
The relation between QZc and measured pressure reveals the direct effect of wave reflections on 
the arterial system.(94) We will therefore quantify the additional ejection -phase pressure load from 
wave reflections arising distal to the root (i.e., reflection- related pressure time integral during 
ejection, as the difference between measured pressure and the QZc product). Carotid -femoral 
pulse wave velocity (PWV), an index of large artery stiffness,(95,96) will also be measured(54,97)  using 
a Sphygmocor device (Atcor Medical).(95) We will also measure carotid -radial PWV using the 
Sphygmocor device. PWV is not a formal endpoint of this trial, since our pi[INVESTIGATOR_610494] -rich beetroot juice on this endpoint (unpublished data). However, 
it may aid in interpreting changes in pulsatile hemodynamics in the trial.  Similarly, when available, 
arterial tonometry may be performed during and immediately after exercise for exploratory 
purposes .  
8.5. Blood nitrate/nitrite level measurements  
We will document an intervention- related change in blood nitrate and nitrite. Nitrate and nitrite

Venous blood samples will be drawn into lithium -heparin tubes (which have very low levels of 
nitrate/nitrite) and centrifuged at 4,000 rpm for 10 min within 3 min of collection and frozen at -
80°C for later analysis . Blood will also be obtained at peak exercise. After thawing at room 
temperature, blood samples will be deproteinized using cold ethanol precipi[INVESTIGATOR_610495].(98) The nitrate and nitrite content of deproteinized blood will be determined using a 
modified detection chemiluminescence technique using a Ionics/Sievers nitric oxide analyzer 
(NOA 28 0), as first described by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Ischiropoulos’ lab(99) and later adapted by [CONTACT_610524].(100)   
 
8.6. Flow -mediated brachial artery dilation  
Endothelial function will be assessed using flow -mediated dilation of the brachial artery (FMD) 
according to published guidelines.(101) The protocol is described in greater detail elsewhere.(102-
104) Briefly, brachial artery diameter will be measured us ing a 10 -Mhz ultrasound transducer (Unex 
Co. Ltd., Nagoya, Japan) at baseline after [ADDRESS_809498]. A stereotactic arm will be 
used for optimal transducer position. A pneumatic cuff will be inflated over the right forearm to 50 
mmHg above the sys tolic pressure and deflated after 5 minutes.  The diastolic brachial artery 
diameter will be measured continuously using the Unex device beginning at 30 seconds prior to 
cuff inflation and ending 2 minutes after cuff release. Maximal arterial vasodilation will be 
evaluated by [CONTACT_610525].  
8.7. Other assessme nts 
Weight and Height:  Weight will be measured to the nearest 0.[ADDRESS_809499] 0.1 cm using a wall -mounted stadiometer.  
Genetic Expression Analysis : Blood RNA sample s will be collected using BD PAXgene blood 
RNA tubes (BD Biosciences) i n order to explore changes in genetic expression in response to the 
study medication (potassium nitrate) and whether patterns of genetic ex pression predict response 
to the study medication.  Two 2.5 mL  sample s (total of 5 mL  of blood ) will be collected at each [ADDRESS_809500] with the data management team and the IND sponsor as 
needed. He will also establish subcommittees and working groups  to complete specific activities, 
monitor study implementation, and hold regular investigator calls/meetings . [CONTACT_610542] will 
supervise the investigative team to develop and coordinate procedures  and generate reports and 
presentations . Other roles of Dr . Chirinos will include directing the echocardiography and arterial 
hemodynamics core laboratory for this trial.  
9.2. Investigators Committee  
An Investigators Committee will hold a monthly call and discuss aspects of the study, including 
enrollment, retent ion, data management, quality assurance, and other issues as they arise.  [CONTACT_610543] will chair the committee , which will include the following members: Julio Chirinos, 
Anupam Kumar , Howard Hermann, Frank Silvestry , Saif Anwaruddin. Minutes of these meetings 
will be distributed and kept on file. The PI  [INVESTIGATOR_610496]. The PI  [INVESTIGATOR_610497] . The sponsor has the final responsibility for all study 
decisions.  
9.3. Operational Affairs Committee  
This committee will be responsible for oversight and coordination of the day -to-day activities of 
the project.  Committee members will include the site PI , the study coordinators, and the 
echocardiography/tonometry quantification technician. This group, along with all of the members 
of the Investigators Committee, will hold an in- person meeting at the beginning of the project to 
review the study protocol and the poli cies and procedures for its implementation. Members of the 
Operational Affairs Committee will participate in the Investigators Committee, but may hold 
additional meetings/calls throughout the project to review subject recruitment, retention, data 
transfer,  quality of data, etc. Minutes of these meetings will be distributed and kept on file.  
9.4. Data Management  
The data for this trial will be collected in ad hoc source documents by [CONTACT_610526], using trial -specific and visit -specific data collection forms. All source documents 
collected in this trial will be housed inside of a locked cabinet in the o ffices of the research staff. 
Data capture and storage will be accomplished within the framework of the Research Electronic 
Data Capture (REDCap) project. REDCap is a secure, web- based application designed 
exclusively to support data capture for research studies. It provides an intuitive interface for data 
entry with data validation, audit trails for tracking data manipulation and export procedures, 
automated export procedures for seamless data downloads to common statistical packages, 
including SAS, and procedures for importing data from external sources. As of March 2015, 
REDCap was in production use or prototype build -status for m ore than 99,000 studies spanning 
numerous research focus areas across a consortium of 940 active institutional partners, including 
the University of Pennsylvania.  Once the REDCap database  is launched into production mode, 
the study coordinators will be responsible for transmitting the participant coded electronic data 
using standardized data collection instruments to the database manager who will check the data 
PULSE AS V3  -  02-Aug -2018  
Confidential and Proprietary Information of the Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania  25 for accuracy and completeness and follow -up with the research assistants as needed. The 
research  coordinators will perform manual data entry from s ource documents and s elf-
administered participant questionnaires (such as quality of life questionnaires).  
9.5. Quantification Core Laboratories  
Various physiologic core laborator y units  will be in charge  of analyzing physiologic data from the 
trial.  
Echocardiography Core Laboratory : The echocardiography core lab, directed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Chirinos, 
has extensive experience in analyzing echocardiographic data for multicenter trials. The lab 
functions as the core lab for 2 ongoing international multicenter trials in heart failure (CVRx 
HOPE4HF and CVRx NeoHF) and one US -based multicenter study focused on HFPEF and 
HFREF (BMS CV002004). The core lab has all the capabilities required for ech ocardiographic 
data management and quantification in this study. The core lab has well -established standard 
procedures for receiving and logging imaging data, quantitative analyses, quality control, audit 
trails, and communication with study sites (queries  about individual issues, feedback for quality 
control). The core lab will be responsible for generat ing and updating manuals for 
echocardiographic data acquisition, which will standardize procedures across the sites. The core 
lab will certify individual t echnicians performing measurements for the study after reviewing of 
sample scans (from normal volunteers) across the [ADDRESS_809501] the capacity to veto individual technicians from perfor ming 
studies for the trial, based on data quality. The echocardiographic core lab will hold monthly calls 
with a representative of the data management core to discuss issues regarding core lab data 
management.  
 
Arterial hemodynamics and exercise physiology  core laboratory : The arterial hemodynamics 
core lab, directed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Chirinos, has experience in analyzing hemodynamic data for various 
large cohort studies (MESA, Asklepi[INVESTIGATOR_141687] )(57,67,69,71,106- 109) and currently functions as the core 
lab for physiologic data for several ongoing multicenter studies (ACRIN 4008, BMS CV002004, 
iCAP study, CREST study). The core lab has specific experience in assessing specific exercise-
related phenotypes relevant to inorganic nitrate effects (82) and has adequate capabilities required 
for physiologic data manage ment and quantification in this study. The physiology core lab will 
hold monthly calls with a representative of the data management core to discuss issues regarding 
core lab data management.  
  
Imaging data management:  All imaging electronic data will be stored within a secure HIPAA-
compliant network -attached storage server, and is accessible only to those who are specifically 
given access by [CONTACT_610527]. The secure server has mechanisms for redundant storage 
and data backup at different physical locations, to prevent data loss from disasters (such as a 
fire).

10.1. Power calculations  
We will randomize 22 subjects to one of 2 sequences (i), each of which consists of 2 periods 
(AB/BA design). We now have pi[INVESTIGATOR_610498] 2 
(the primary endpoint of the study) as well as various secondary endpoints, among patients with 
HFpEF. We considered an increase in peak VO 2 of ~0.6 ml/kg/min to be t he minimum clinically -
significant change. This was based on the fact that even “modest” changes of comparable 
magnitude in peak VO [ADDRESS_809502] been associated with improved outcomes.(110) The standard 
deviation of the change in peak VO 2 in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_468757] 1.23 ml/kg/min. Therefore, the 
standardized effect size is 0.49 or greater. Assuming a 90% retention rate, enrolling [ADDRESS_809503] 80% power to detect  an effect size as low as 0.66 in the 
intervention -induced change of our study endpoints, with a two- sided α=0.05.  
Based on the distribution of the changes in study endpoints from repeated measurements of the 
Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire in AS  patients, we estimated that this trial study is 
powered (80%) to detect the following changes in other endpoints: 4.6 points for the Kansas City 
Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire, 8.2% for exercise vasodilatory reserve, 19% for cardiac output 
reserve and 4.2% change in reflection magnitude.  We note that these differences are well below 
what is considered a clinically significant change in KCCQ (10 points or more, 
http://cvoutcomes.org/pages/3217 ) or the effect size that has been observed for these endpoints 
in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_265820].(85) Therefore, we are confident that we will achieve adequate power not only for 
our clinical endpoints, but also for ou r physiologic measures. PASS11(111) was used  to perform 
power analyses.  
10.2. Data Analysis Plan  
The co-primary outcome variables will be peak VO [ADDRESS_809504] for all aims will be intervention (KNO 3 
therapy vs. control ), with analyses based upon the total number of subjects randomized. Initial 
descriptive estimates of all measures will be generated for study participants at each time point 
by [CONTACT_1570]. Statistics will include estimates of central tendency, measur es of variability, 
and derived moments of skewness and kurtosis. Analyses of distributional properties will be 
performed to determine if variance stabilizing or normalizing transformations should be applied. 
Outliers will be assessed via visual inspection of distributions and checked for accuracy.  Aim 1 
will assess the effects of potassium nitrate therapy on peak O2  / work performed  and quality of 
life score ( co-primary  outcomes).  An initial assessment of the treatment effect will be performed 
using the pair ed t-test and the non- parametric Wilcoxon sign- rank test on the difference between 
the paired within subject outcome measures. This will be followed by a more comprehensive linear 
mixed -effects model analysis(112) allowing for assessments of the treatment effect on each 
continuous outcome of interest while controlling for effe cts of other covariates such as period, 
sequence, and a random subject effect nested within sequence. For non- normal distributed 
outcomes, we will utilize non- parametric methods or consider distribution- stabilizing 
transformations. The intervention groups will initially  be compared within each period (time 
invariant covariates will only be compared for period 1) according to continuous covariates 
PULSE AS V3  -  02-Aug -[ADDRESS_809505] ANOVA models, depending upon 
whether or not normality  appears to be in question. Levine’s tests will be used to assess 
homogeneity of variance. Additionally, the intervention groups will be compared within period 
according to categorical covariates using Fisher’s Exact tests. Significant differences between 
groups on these variables will result in their use as control variables in the modeling of outcome.  
Separate models will be generated for each of the two outcome measures, with each outcome 
measure regressed on intervention group assignment, along with baseline outcome and any other 
covariates deemed prognostic in preliminary analyses. The linear mixed- effects models will 
incorporate adjustments for any period effect and include data from dropouts.(113- 115) The model 
will include subject -specific intercepts a s random effects , and assumes independent and 
identically distributed random errors within subject. Restricted maximum likelihood estimation will 
be used, and an appropriate covariance matrix will be specified.  Model assumptions will be 
examined (e. g., QQ plots to assess  normally distributed residuals for valid Wald tests). We will 
make every possible effort to minimize missing data and ensure final assessments for participants 
opting to discontinue study participat ion.  Missing data, however, is an inevitable problem in a 
longitudinal study. The mechanism for missingness -missing completely at random (MCAR), 
missing at random (MAR), nonignorable or not missing at random (NMAR) -will be evaluated prior 
to implementing methodology intended to minimize bias from missing data.(116) We anticipate that 
~10% of randomized subjects will not complete the study .  
 The intent -to-treat principle of including all randomized participants in the outcome models will 
be followed. SAS software procedures will be used for creating and analyzing multiple imputed 
data sets for incomplete multivariate data. Instead of filling in a single value for each missing 
value, Rubin's(117) multiple imputation procedure replaces each missing value with a set of 
plausible values that represent the uncertainty about the correct value to impute. These multiple 
imputed data sets are then analyzed using standard procedures for complete data and combining 
the results from this analysis. Assuming monotone missing data patterns emerge, either a 
param etric regression method that assumes multivariate normality or a nonparametric method 
that uses propensity scores will be implemented, depending upon distributional patterns.   
Analytic methods described above will take advantage of all available data. The possibility of 
systematic bias in the outcomes for those who withdraw exists. Baseline characteristics will be 
compared among subjects with and without complete follow -up, recognizing that statistical power 
associated with finding true statistical differences may be limited. To assess potential biases, a 
comparison of withdrawal rates and or/time to withdrawal will be included. If the number of 
subjects lost to follow -up is small and the missing observations can be documented as being MAR 
or MCAR, then the primary hypotheses will be tested using the complete observed data. If missing 
observations cannot be assumed to be MAR or MCAR, more complex approaches will be 
considered.  Sensitivity analyses for these models will be performed should they be 
implemented.(118)  
Our secondary aims involve exploratory analyses investigating mechanisms of action. In addition 
to assessing the effect of our randomized intervention on each mechanistic endpoint, exploratory 
structural equation modeling will be used to evaluate associations between outcomes and biologic 
mechanistic pathways. The modeling will be carried out in three sequential steps: (1) exploratory 
factor analysis, (2) confirmatory factor analysis,  and (3) structural equation modeling. The 
exploratory factor analysis will be based on principal axis factoring to decrease the number of 
PULSE AS V3  -  02-Aug -[ADDRESS_809506] 
the following four rules: (1) eigenvalues greater than 1.0(119); (2) G lorfeld’s(120) extension of parallel 
analysis, where a large number of random correlation matrices are generated  to compare the 
number of eigenvalues that are significant by [CONTACT_3364](121); (3) high internal consistency (an alpha 
coefficient of  ≥ 0.70) for unit -weighted factors,(122) and (4) interpretability.(123) The heaviest weight 
will be placed on the Minimum Average Partial and parallel analysis methods, with the scree test 
as a visual adjunct.(124) The next step involves incorporating the factors into a model using 
confirmatory factor analysis.  The model will be tested using goodness of fit tests to assess the 
overall fit of the model to the data.  Various models will be tested and compared prior to arriving 
at the best fitting model. And finally, the best fitting model obtained from confirmatory factor 
analysis will incorporate a structural equation model designed to examine the links between the 
randomized intervention, the mechanistic variables and the clinical variables asses sed in the trial.    
 
11. PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS 
11.1. Potential benefits of the proposed research to the study subjects and importance of 
the knowledge to be gained, and risk/benefit ratio 
Potential  benefits : There are no anticipated direct benefits to the subjects as a result of their 
participation in this study nor will this be implied when obtaining consent. However, if our 
hypothesis is correct, subjects in the active medication groups may experience improv ements in 
their functional class and quality of life, although this will not be implied in any way during informed 
consent or enrollment.  
Importance of the knowledge to be gained: If our hypothesis is correct, this study may identify an 
effective specific  intervention to treat mechanistic abnormalities in AS patients. Furthermore, if 
improving these abnormalities leads to an enhanced exercise capacity in this patient population, 
this would lead to a new paradigm in the field and a better understanding of t he mechanisms that 
lead or contribute to AS, which will accelerate the discovery of new treatments for this condition. 
In addition, if potassium nitrate proves effective in enhancing exercise capacity and/or quality of 
life in this trial, this would identi fy a readily implementable, inexpensive therapy for this condition.  
Risk/benefit ratio : the results of this study may ultimately lead to  an effective treatment for 
persistent symptoms of AS after AV . Since there is minimal risk and potential benefits to medical 
knowledge and society, the risk / benefit ratio is acceptable.  
11.2. Risks to study subjec ts  
The conduct of these studies will involve 22 human subjects, each exposed to both the active 
drug (potassium nitrate) and control (potassium chloride) inte rvention (cross -over design), and 
therefore studied as their own controls. All subjects will be adults able to give informed consent. 
Participants will be recruited from the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_71971]. The ethnic 
distribution of the population in our center will favor adequate representation of minorities 
(particularly, African- Americans) in the sample.  
PULSE AS V3  -  02-Aug -2018  
Confidential and Proprietary Information of the Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania  29 The study involves various tests (arterial tonometry, Doppler echocardiography, a 
cardiopulmonary exercise stress, blood draws) and the administration of randomized therapy 
(KNO 3 vs. control ). 
 
11.2.1. Potential Risks of study intervention (potassium nitrate)  
The main potential risks of nitrate administration are related to its potential effect on (1) blood 
pressure; and (2) methemoglobin levels.  
Effects on blood pressure: Regarding the blood pressure reduction, as described above, many 
studies have demonstrated a reduction in blood pressure in both hypertensive and normal 
subjects following nitrate supplementation. This was summarized in a recent meta -analysis, 
demonstrating an approximate 4 mm Hg reduction in systolic blood pressure and 1 mm Hg 
reduction in diastolic blood pressure.(43) Importantly, in a  study by [CONTACT_610528] a single dose of 
inorganic nitrate in subjects with HFpEF, we did not observe any change in blood pressure 
following nitrate inges tion. Importantly, the lack of a blood pressure response to nitrate has been 
shown in both elderly(125) and diabetic individuals,(126) suggesting that there may be important 
differences in nitrate effect by [CONTACT_12125]. In our pharmacokinetics study, we found a mild (~ 12 
mm Hg) asymptomatic reduction in blood pressure recorded at the time of our study visits during 
2-week drug administration, which occurred in the absence of any hypotensive symptoms .(127) We 
did not find a reduction in ambulatory blood pressure. Therefore, although we do not  anticipate 
major changes in BP or significant hypotension with this dose, we will implement exclusion criteria 
and safety blood pressure checks throughout the conduct of the study  to ensure subject safety  
(see next  section) . 
Impact of NO 3- on methemoglobin levels: Nitrate supplementation increases serum nitrite 
levels through the actions of an enterosalivary circuit and reduction of nitrate to nitrite by [CONTACT_610529].(20,25 -28) Methemoglobin is generated by [CONTACT_610530]. According to Toxnet, doses between 2- [ADDRESS_809507] been associated with 
methemoglobinemia. The dose we will use in our study (18 mmol KNO 3-) will provide  only 1.11 
grams (18 mmol NO 3- x 62 grams/mol NO 3- x 1mol/1000 mmol), which is well below this threshold. 
Moreover, this level of nitrate supplementation provides less inorganic nitrate than that found in a 
traditional Japanese diet, which is rich in veget ables (traditional Japanese diet provides 18.8 
mg/kg of nitrate per day x 70 kg individual = 1.3 grams of nitrate).(128) Moreover, not a single cases 
of methemoglobinemia was observed in our pharmacokinetics trial , at the same doses used in 
this trial and in the same patient population . In the pharmacokinetics study we measur ed 
methemoglobin every half hour after the first administration as well as during steady -state 
continued oral administration at doses of both 12 mmol/d and 18 mmol/d and did not find any 
clinically -significant elev ations in methemoglobin. We don’t anticipate any significant issues with 
methemoglobinemia in this study  since this is a problem that has been reported with nitrite, but 
not with nitrate at the doses used in this study.  
Safety data:  
In a double- blind randomized controlled trial in HFPEF, in which 12.9 mmol of inorganic were 
administered to patients with HFpEF, efficacy was demonstrated for the study endpoint (please 
refer to research plan). In this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], no side effects were noted in any subject , except for 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_46821] (which was not different between the nitrate -rich and nitrate- poor beetroot juice, 
PULSE AS V3  -  02-Aug -2018  
Confidential and Proprietary Information of the Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania  30 because this is a consequence of other components of beetroot juice).  As the body is able to 
reduce oxidized Fe3+ in methemoglobin back to Fe2+ at a rate of approximately 15% per hour,(129) 
the gradual increase in nitrite that occurs after nitrate administration (and the consequent 
formation of methem oglobin), should occur slowly enough to prevent significant rises in 
methemoglobin. To the best of our knowledge, methemoglobinemia has not been reported with 
oral nitrate administration. In our pharmacokinetic study, we did not observe any clinically -relevant 
elevations in methemoglobin levels(127).  
Other potential safety considerations:  
There has been concern regarding whether a high nitrate diet may predispose to gastric cancer 
in humans through conversion to nitrite in the stomach or through increased urinary excr etion of 
nitrate metabolites. This is a controversial issue derived from animal studies(130), although the 
relationship between nitrate intake and cancer has not been demonstrated in humans.(23,131,132)  In 
fact, many studies show either no relationship or even an invers e relationship between a high 
intake of nitrate and the occurrence of gastric cancer.(133,134)  (135,136)  (137,138) The Joint FAO/WHO 
Expert Committee on Food reviewed all the available evidence, but failed to establish a definite 
link between nitrate intake and risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_50876].(139,140) Furthermore, The World Cancer 
Research Fund/American Institute of Cancer Research found no evidence linking ingestion of 
vegetables which are known to be high in nitrate with the development of cancer(141) . We note that 
the highly controversial concern regarding cancer risk associated with nitrate intake is related to 
long-term intake and not a significant issue with our 6-week administration scheme of potassium 
nitrate.  
11.2.2. Potential Risks of study proc edures  
Potential risks are associated with the study tests, the study interventions (potassium nitrate) and 
potential breaches in confidentiality.  
 
Cardiopulmonary stress test  
This test is used extensively for research purposes with minimal risk to subjects. The most 
significant risks of the test are dysrhythmias or other cardiovascular complications, which are 
extremely rare. These procedures will be performed by [CONTACT_610531].(142,143) Non-revascularized myocardial 
ischemia, which may increase the risk of complications during exercise testing, is an exclusion 
criterion for t he study.  We note that prior studies in HFpEF also enrolled subjects with atrial 
fibrillation(144) and that rate- controlled atrial fibrillation is not a contraindication to exercise testing.   
Subjects may feel uncomfortable as a result of pushing themselves during the maximal effort 
exercise test. Subjects will likely f eel short of breath and fatigued as a result of the exercise test. 
Various other complaints, such as nausea, lightheadedness, and other aches and pains are also 
possible as a result of the maximal effort exercise study. Although exercise testing may result  in 
exhaustion, rarely do people develop abnormal HR or heart complications during exercise tests. 
The risk of this happening is the same as if the participant would exert themselves during stressful 
situations or during exercise elsewhere.  
We will perform  EKG, HR, and blood pressures monitoring during our exercise test. In addition to 
the blood pressure (generally increases) and heart rate (generally increases) changes during 
PULSE AS V3  -  02-Aug -2018  
Confidential and Proprietary Information of the Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania  31 exercise, we will also monitor arterial saturation. This will be done non- invasively using a pulse 
oximeter . Of note, oxygen levels can decrease with exercise, even in individuals without 
significant cardiopulmonary disease.(145,146) If the arterial saturation falls to below  88% (“severe 
exercise induced hypoxemia”(146)), we will alert the care provider as this may prompt consideration 
for additional/alternative causes for arterial hypoxemia.  
Venipuncture and IV placement  
According to the 2010 WHO guidelines on phlebotomy, major risks associated with blood 
donations include hematoma at the site of venipuncture in 2- 3%, and vasovagal reactions and 
fainting in 1%. The placement of an intravenous catheter would be anticipated to increase the risk 
of hematoma and discomfort slightly. Given that the catheter will be in place for a short -period of 
time, i nfection is an unlikely complication. Of note, the amount of blood to be drawn in the study 
is less than the amount of blood drawn at routine blood donation where the risk of syncope of 1% 
was defined.  
Arterial tonometry  and assessments of oscillometric arterial pressure waveforms  are non-invasive 
procedures and do not have any known risks.  
During various procedures (echocardiography, arterial tonometry), we will use adhesive 
electrodes attached to the participant’s skin to record the electrical signal fr om the heart. These 
may occasionally cause skin itching and irritation.  
Pregnancy Risks 
We will not be enrolling subjects who are pregnant in this study. Right now, there is not enough 
research on the potassium nitrate to determine the safety of the mother or unborn child. A 
pregnancy test will be given to women of child- bearing potential prior to enrollment in the study 
and administration of the supplement. The pregnancy test will be repeated at the 6-week visit 
(prior to initiation of the second treatment period) . If a w oman is enrolled of child- bearing potential , 
we will ask that they use a medically accepted method of birth control (such as an IUD, birth 
control combination pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382], patch, ring, progestin- only pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], Depo Provera Shot, Implanon, complete 
abstinence, or condoms) while they participate in the study. In addition, we will test for pregnancy 
at each study visit and discontinue subjects from the study immediately if she becomes pregnant. 
As subjects with AS are generally older (>55 years old) we do not anticipate this concern to occur 
with our study population. We will not enroll pregnant women or women who are lactating.  
As with any clinical research study, there is a potential for breach of confidentiality . Adequate 
measures will be taken to minimize this risk ( below).  
11.3. Adequacy of Protection Against Risks   
11.3.1. Recruitment and Informed Consent  
Written informed consent will be obtained from the subjects by [CONTACT_610532]. This will be performed in accordance with the guidelines and under the 
supervision of the University of Pennsylvania Institutional Review Boards. The study procedures 
and interventions and the associated risks will be explained to the subjects during the informed 
consent process. Only IRB -approved consent forms and related materials will be used.  
PULSE AS V3  -  02-Aug -[ADDRESS_809508] risks associated with cardiopulmonary exercise tests  
These tests will be performed by [CONTACT_610533] (142) , under ECG monitoring. Personnel with adequate cardiopulmonary 
resuscitation training and resuscitation equipment (crash cart) will be available during these tests. 
Similarly, these tests wi ll be performed in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_610499] a full code team can be 
deployed immediately should complications occur.  
11.3. 3. Protection against risks of potassium nitrate administration:  
Subjects will be thoroughly advised regarding the potential risks of the study medication and 
precautions needed during its administration. We will exclude individuals who are taking sildenafil 
(Viagra®), tadalafil (Cialis®), or vardenafil (Levitra®) and we will instruct them not to take these 
medications while participating in the study, since it is likely that these medications may 
exaggerate the vasoactive effects of potassium nitrate. Similarly, the use of organic nitrate will be 
contraindicated during participation in this trial.  
Supi[INVESTIGATOR_610500]:  Supi[INVESTIGATOR_610501]. The subject will rest in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_19636] a minimum of 3 minutes prior to 
obtaining vital sign measurements. Subjects with a supi[INVESTIGATOR_9219] >[ADDRESS_809509] will then assume a standing position for 3 -5 minutes. Vital signs 
(BP and pulse rate) will then be measured while the subject is standing. A reduction in systolic 
blood pressure >20 mmHg will be considered an exclusion criterion fo r the study. Blood pressure 
measurements will be repeated after 4   ± 1 weeks of randomized therapy. Measurements will also 
be prompted by [CONTACT_610534]. The presence of symptomatic orthostatic hypotension (20 mmHg reduction in systolic 
blood pressure with associated symptom such as dizziness) will prompt exclusion of patients from 
the trial.  
 
Safety Clinical Laboratory Tests:   Laboratory evaluations will be collected prior to study drug 
initiation.   Among women who are not surgically sterilized or post -menopausal, a urine pregnancy 
test will be performed at screening (prior to all baseline studies and drug initiation), at the end of 
the first treatment phase  (prior to the initiation of the second treatment phase). Methemoglobin 
levels will be measured before initiation of randomized therapy and 4   ± 1 weeks after initiation of 
randomized therapy  in both treatment phases (1 and 2). Methemoglobinemia (methemoglobin 
levels > 10%) will prompt discontinuation of patients from the trial. Other tests, including a 
complete blood count, liver enzymes, a basic metabolic panel (including serum creatinine for 
assessments of renal function) will also be performed prior to randomization and 4 ± [ADDRESS_809510] administration as well as during steady -state 
continued oral administration at doses of both 12 mmol/d and 18 mmol/d . We don’t anticipate any 
significant issu es with methemoglobinemia since this is a problem that has been reported with 
nitrite, but not with nitrate at the doses used in this study. However, a more strict monitoring 
approach for methemoglobinemia will be implementing should the results of our ong oing 
pharmacokinetics/safety study  raise any concerns .  
PULSE AS V3  -  02-Aug -[ADDRESS_809511] management Plan:   No side effects have been observed in our single -dose study or 
our pharmacokinetics study (in particular, no hypotension or methemoglobinemia). However, a 
plan for manage ment of side effects will be in place. The use of acetaminophen may be used for 
headaches during the study. Although hypotension is not expected, it should be managed as per 
standard clinical practice.  In the unlikely event that methemoglobinemia does occ ur during the 
trial, we will manage according to best clinical standards. (147)  As the endogenous rate of 
reconversion from methemoglobin to hemoglobin is approximately 15% per hour, most 
asymptomatic patients can be managed conservatively. Generally, methemoglobin levels >20% 
with symptoms, or >30% without symptoms, warrant therapy; any patient with levels that are 
elevated to thi s range will be referred to the emergency room for management. (147)   
11.3.4. Measures to minimize the risk of breach in confidentiality:  
All records will be treated with strict confidentiality according to HIPAA guidelines (all study 
personnel are trained on HIPAA regulations). Blood samples obtained from subjects will be used 
only for research purposes. Records will be treated w ith strict confidentiality and stored in a 
secured, limited access area. A randomly assigned number rather than name [CONTACT_610541] .  A secure database of patient information will be maintained. The investigators  
and the sponsor  will h ave access to research information and will follow IRB and institutional 
HIPAA guidelines. Paper files will be saved under lock in a secure IRB -approved area.  
 
11.3.6 Other measures to minimize risk:   
Phlebotomy, arterial tonometry, and Doppler echocardiographic examinations will only be 
performed by [CONTACT_413756].   
12. REGULATORY STANDARDS  
12.1. Informed consent  
The site investigator, or a person designated by [CONTACT_6962], will fully  inform the subject 
of all pertinent aspects of the clinical trial including the review of the informed consent form 
approved by [CONTACT_3551] (IRB).  Prior to a subject's participation in the clinical 
trial, the Informed Consent Form will be signed and personally dated by [CONTACT_325567]’s legally acceptable representative.  All subjects will receive a copy of the informed 
consent form.  
12.2. Institutional Review Board (IRB)  
The site Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_610502]. The study (study number, 
protocol title and version number), the document reviewed (protocol, Informed Consent Form, 
etc.) and the date of the review will be clearly stated on the written IRB approval opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649].  During 
the study, any  amendment or modification to the protocol will be sent to the IRB. It will also be 
informed of any event likely to affect the safety of subjects or the continued conduct of the study, 
in particular any change in safety and all updates to the protocol will  be sent to IRB.  
PULSE AS V3  -  02-Aug -[ADDRESS_809512]’s study records, including signed informed consent forms, HIPPA forms, 
source documents, and other study related materials will be stored in the subject binders, in a 
locked file cabinet in the research coordinator’s study office until archived. Research records will 
be retained for at least [ADDRESS_809513] 6 years after IRB acknowledgement of  study termination. Files are not be 
destroyed or deleted without Sponsor approval. Data will be made available to the study sponsor 
National Institute of Health (NIH) members of the Institutional Review Board, and the Food and 
Drug administration, if requested by [CONTACT_610535].

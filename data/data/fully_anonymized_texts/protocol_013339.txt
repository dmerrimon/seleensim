OVERALL  RATIONALE FOR  PROTOCOL  AMENDMENT 04: 
Key changes in this protocol amendment are the addition to Part 1C of lower  dose levels of BMS - 
986207 (≤ 600 mg every  3 weeks) that may  be tested  in order to better  estimate the tolerability  of 
the optimal dose level of BMS -987207 in combination with nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. In 
addition, the triplet combination of BMS -986207 + nivolumab + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_499703]- line non- small cell lung cancer (1L NSCLC) participants with PD -L1 tumor cell positive 
expression ≥ 1% (Part 2C). Additional doses lower  than the dose declared  tolerable  in Part 1C may 
be tested for dose optimization in Part 2C. This will be examined in order to further develop the 
BMS -986207 program. 
This protocol amendment also updates contraception and pregnancy requirements in women of 
childbearing potential (WOCBP) and contraception requirements in males based on the available 
scientific evidence.

1 SYNOPSIS  
Protocol  Title:  Phase 1/2a First -In-Human  Study  of BMS -986207  Monoclonal  Antibody  Alone  and in 
Combination with Nivolumab or with Nivolumab and Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_499709]: An Investigational  Immuno -therapy  Study  of BMS -986207  Given  Alone  and in Combination  With 
Nivolumab or with Nivolumab and Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_499710]:  Phase  1/2a 
Rationale: BMS -986207, an anti- T cell immunoglobulin (Ig) and immunoreceptor tyrosine -based inhibitory motif 
(ITIM)  domain  (TIGIT) monoclonal antibody  (mAb),  is being  studied  alone  and in combination  with nivolumab or in 
combination with nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_499711].  
Tumors  modulate  and evade  the host immune  response  through  a number  of mechanisms,  including  down  regulation 
of tumor -specific antigen  expression  and presentation,  secretion  of anti-inflammatory  cytokines,  and upregulation of 
inhibitory  ligands. Immunotherapeutic approaches such as checkpoint pathway blockade have demonstrated clinical 
efficacy  in several  cancers,  including melanoma,  renal  cell, lung,  and hormone -refractory  prostate  cancers.  Following 
the success of anti- cytotoxic T -lymphocyte -associated protein (CTLA -4) and anti -programmed cell death 1 (PD -1) 
pathway -targeted agents in several cancers, the field of tumor immunotherapy is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_499712], recognizing the 
potential value of combination therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
BMS -986207 is a fully human variant immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds with high 
affinity  to TIGIT  (T cell immunoreceptor  with immunoglobulin  and immunoreceptor  tyrosine -based  inhibitory  motif 
domain), a negative regulatory molecule that suppresses activation and functional responses in T cells and natural 
killer  (NK)  cells.  TIGIT  upregulation  has been  observed in cancer  patients,  in particular  on T cells,  and is co-expressed 
with of T cell exhaustion. Binding of poliovirus receptor (PVR) and Nectin- 2 (TIGIT ligands) to TIGIT 
results in suppression of T cell and NK cell function. These same ligands also bind with lower affinity to the stimulatory receptor CD226 (DNAX accessory molecule 1 [DNAM -1]) also expressed on effector T cells. Blockade 
of TIGIT  with molecules  like BMS -[ADDRESS_643316] a number of malignancies.  
 
Study  Population: Participants  must be at least [ADDRESS_643317]  histologic  or cytologic  confirmation  of a solid 
tumor that is advanced (metastatic, recurrent and/or unresectable) with measurable disease per Response Evaluation 
Criteria in Solid  Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. For Part 2C, participants must have NSCLC, be treatment- naive, and have 
pre-existing  or prior  PD-L1 IHC results  from  testing  of tumor  tissue.  PD-L1 expression must  be tumor  cell positive  
≥ 1% f or  a participant  to be eligible  for enrollment.

OVERALL DESIGN  
This is a Phase  1/2a,  open- label  study  of BMS -986207  administered  as a single  agent,  in combination  with nivolumab, 
and in combination  with both nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_499716]. The duration of 
the study will be approximately 6 years.  
The study  comprises  2 parts.  Part 1 includes  dose escalation  of BMS -986207 alone  (Part  1A) and in combination  with 
nivolumab (Part  1B) to determine  the MTD/RP2D,  as well as a select  dose level  of BMS -986207  in combination  with 
nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (Part 1C) to evaluate safety and preliminary  activity  of the triplet  combination. 
Part 1B includes a substudy conducted at a single site under site -specific Amendments 6, 7, and 8 to evaluate the 
safety  and preliminary  efficacy  of BMS -986207  in combination  with nivolumab in PD-1 naive  and relapsed/refractory 
participants with melanoma. Part 2 includes expansion cohorts to gather additional preliminary  activity,  as 
well as additional safety, tolerability, PK,  information for BMS -986207 alone (Part 2A), in 
combination with nivolumab (Part 2B), and in combination with nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_499708] (Part 2C). Participants  in each study  phase  will complete up to 4 periods  in the study: screening,  treatment,  safety  follow -up, and 
response/survival follow -up. The overall  study design is illustrated  in Figure  1 and the treatment  cohorts  are presented 
in Figure 2 . 
Screening : The screening period will last for up to 28 days, and will begin by [CONTACT_499792]’s initial 
eligibility and signing of the informed consent form. Participants will be enrolled using an Interactive Response 
Technology (IRT).  
Preliminary Safety Cohort : The Preliminary Safety Cohort precedes participant enrollment  in Monotherapy -Dose 
Escalation  (Part  1A) of the study.  The first participant  enrolled  into monotherapy escalation  will receive  BMS -[ADDRESS_643320] 20-mg dose.  If no dose -limiting  toxicities 
(DLTs) or other safety concerns  are observed, an additional 2 participants will be enrolled in the 20- mg dose cohort.  
Treatment: P
 articipants  in Parts  1A, 1B, 2A, and 2B will be treated  for up to 24 weeks  (3 cycles)  with monotherapy 
(Parts 1A and 2A) or combination therapy  (Parts 1B and 2B). The treatment period will consist of up to 3 treatment

 cycles of 8 weeks. Following each treatment cycle, the decision to treat a participant with additional cycles of study 
therapy (up to a maximum of 6 cycles), will be based on tumor assessment at the end of each cycle. In Parts 1C and 
2C, nivolumab and BMS -986207  will be administered  every  3 weeks  and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_499717] 
6 weeks until progression, unacceptable toxicity, or other reasons specified in the protocol for up to 2 years.  
Each  monotherapy  treatment  cycle  will comprise  4 doses  of BMS -986207  administered  every  2 weeks  (q2w) or 
2 doses  of BMS -986207  every  4 weeks  (q4w) in Part 1A and 2A. BMS -[ADDRESS_643321]  over 
60 minutes and will require a 60  minute observation period after all infusions in Cycle 1 for each participant. For 
participants <  [ADDRESS_643322] v1.1 criteria for solid tumors. The study design is shown in Figure 2 . 
The approximate  number  of evaluable  participants  will be 241. Approximately  100 of these  participants  will be treated 
with monotherapy  and combination  dose escalation  (Part  1A and Part 1B, respectively).  Approximately  36 participants 
will be treated (6 initial participants for safety evaluation followed by [CONTACT_499793] 12 additional participants per dose level) with BMS -986207, nivolumab, and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_499718] (Part 1C). The 
remaining (up to 105) participants  will be treated  as part of dose expansion with up to 24 participants in Part 2A  and 
41 participants in Part 2B, and 40 participants with NSCLC pre-existing 
or prior PD -L1 IHC results from testing of tumor tissue) considered to be response -evaluable, in Part 2C.

design, for all the remaining and future subjects, BMS- 986207 was de -escalated to 600 mg Q3W (for details, see 
Section [IP_ADDRESS]) Planned dose levels for BMS -986207 may be further modified based on generated data and 
additional doses, including 360 mg Q3W,  may be assessed per BOIN design and for  dose optimization  analysis  at 
Sponsor discretion and based upon discussion and agreement with investigators.  
d Part 2C will enroll a minimum of 20 participants per dose level of BMS -986207.  One or two doses are planned to 
be evaluated and selected from the range of doses assessed as tolerable and not exceeding the maximum tolerated 
dose in Part 1C. If two doses will be tested at the Sponsor’s discretion, participants will be randomized in a 1:[ADDRESS_643323] been tested at the dose found safe in Part 1C.

 TREATMENT 
Preliminary  Safety  Cohort: The Preliminary  Safety  Cohort  precedes  participant  enrollment  in Monotherapy  - Dose 
Escalation  (Part  1A) of the study.  The first participant  enrolled  into monotherapy escalation  will receive  BMS -[ADDRESS_643324] 20 mg dose.  If there are no DLTs or other safety 
concerns observed, an additional 2 participants will be enrolled in the 20 mg dose cohort.  
 
 
Dose Escalation (Part  1A and Part 1B):  Approximately  35 participants  are expected  to be treated  during  each dose 
escalation part of the study guided by [CONTACT_499794] (BLRM). Each participant will be 
administered intravenous (IV) doses of BMS -986207 per the cohort assignment as described below.  
In Part 1A (monotherapy dose escalation), the planned flat dose levels for BMS- 986207 are 20, 80, 240, 800, and 
1600 mg (assuming an 80 kg participant)  q2w, in 8- week cycles, for up to 3 cycles of study therapy (24 weeks). In 
addition,  a q4wk schedule  of BMS -986207  will be evaluated  at flat doses  of 480 mg and 1600  mg (assuming  an 80 kg 
participant).  Enrollment of the first q4w cohort will be guided by [CONTACT_395494], PK,  analysis  from  the 
q2wk  cohorts. Following each treatment cycle,  the decision to  treat a participant with additional cycles  of study therapy 
(up to a maximum of 6 cycles), will be based on tumor assessment at the end of each cycle.  
In Part 1B, (combination therapy dose escalation), BMS -986207 and nivolumab will be administered at flat doses of 
80 and 240 mg BMS -986207  q2w and 240 mg nivolumab q2w.  In addition,  BMS -986207 will be administered  at flat 
doses of 480, and 1600 mg q4w in combination with nivolumab administered at 480 mg q4w.  Study drugs will be 
administered in 8 -week cycles, for up to 3 cycles of study therapy (24 weeks). Following each treatment cycle, the 
decision  to treat a participant  with additional  cycles  of study  therapy  (up to a maximum  of 6 cycles),  will be based  on 
tumor assessment at the end of each cycle.  
Planned dose levels may be modified, or intermediate dose levels added, based upon the BLRM analysis. Part 1B, combination dose escalation, will be initiated after at least 3 dose levels (ie, 20, 80, and 240 mg dose cohorts), have 
been  found to be tolerable  in Part 1A, monotherapy  dose escalation.  The starting  dose of BMS -[ADDRESS_643325]  tolerated  dose in Part 1A. BLRM  may indicate  evaluation  of intermediate 
dose levels that fall in -between  the planned dose levels. Any dose level increment will be limited to approximately a 
3-fold increase. Subsequently, escalation in Parts 1A and 1B may be done in parallel.  
Participants  w
 ith biopsy eligible  solid  tumors  will be enrolled  in Parts  1A and 1B. Specifically  participants  with tumor 
types  where the microbiome has  been  implicated,  in preclinical or  clinical data,  to mediate TIGIT inhibition,  such as 
but not limited to, CRC and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), will be enrolled in Part 1A. Once the safety (during the dose limiting toxicity [DLT] evaluation) of a dose level has been established (Part 1A 
and/or  Part 1B), additional  participants  (up to a total of 15) may be added  at that dose level,  to better  characterize the 
safety, PK,  profile.  
Sentinel  Participant:  For all dose escalation  cohorts,  a sentinel participant  approach  will be used with a 5-day interval 
between  the treatment  initiation  of the first participant  and the treatment  of subsequent  participants  in that dose level. 
The first participant in both  Part 1A, starting  at the 20-mg dose level,  and Part 1B will receive Cycle  1 Day 1 dose of 
study drug(s), and be observed for [ADDRESS_643326] to a 5- day sentinel period. Initially, 3 participants 
will be enrolled  at the start of each dose-escalation  cohort,  in accordance with the sentinel participant  approach  above. 
However, to allow for any  unforeseen discontinuations (such as disease progression) before the 4 -week DLT period 
is completed, an extra participant may be enrolled at each dose- escalation cohort. Therefore, there will be a total of  
4 participants (3+1)  at the start of each dose-escalation  cohort,  providing the fourth  participant  is able to start the first 
day of dosing within approximately [ADDRESS_643327] participant in the same dose -escalation cohort.  
Triplet Cohort (Part 1C): Approximately 36 participants will be treated (6 initial participants for safety evaluation 
followed by [CONTACT_499793] 12 additional participants for each dose level tested) with BMS -986207, 
nivolumab,  and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_499719] (Part  1C). BMS -986207 will be administered  at 600 mg q3w and/or 
360 mg q3w and nivolumab will be administered at 360 mg q3w. Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], at a dose of 1 mg/kg, will be given q6w.  A dose of 1200  mg BMS -986207  administered  every  3 weeks  has been  tested  per Amendment  03 but due to the

 DLTs observed no additional participants will be tested at this dose (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). Study drugs will be 
administered in [ADDRESS_643328] has investigator -assessed clinical benefit and is tolerating the treatment.  
The DLT period in Part 1C will be 42  days (6 weeks). The DLT safety monitoring during the dose evaluation phase, 
including the potential  decision  to de-escalate to a lower  dose,  will be based  on the Bayesian  optimal interval (BOIN) 
design framework with a dose -limiting toxicity (DLT) rate of 30% (24%, 36%).  
Subjects  who do not complete  the DLT  observation  period  for reasons  other  than DLTs may be replaced.  De-escalation 
may be considered  if the safety  and tolerability  profiles  for the  selected  BMS -986207  dose are  deemed unacceptable, 
after discussion between the investigator (s) and the Sponsor/Medical Monitor.  
Cohort Expansion (Part 2A, 2B, and 2C) : In the cohort expansion part of the study, additional safety, tolerability, 
preliminary efficacy, PK,  information,  regarding BMS -986207 alone  and in combination  with nivolumab,  will 
be sought.  Continuous  evaluation  of toxicity  events  will be performed  throughout  enrollment  in the expansion  cohorts. 
If, at any time, the aggregate rate of treatment- related toxicities meeting DLT criteria exceeds 33% across all 
participants treated in cohort expansions, reassessment of enrollment will take place. Depending on the nature and 
grade of the toxicity and after assessing the risk/benefit ratio, a new dose(s) for all cohorts may be initiated at a 
previously tested lower dose level or at a dose level intermediate to previously tested lower dose levels.  
In Part 2A, only CRC will be evaluated  in cohort expansion with BMS -[ADDRESS_643329]  disease progression  on BMS -986207  monotherapy  will 
be able to cross over to combination treatment (BMS -986207 + nivolumab), once the CRC expansion arms are 
enrolling. This cross -over option is not applicable during the escalation phases. CRC participants with disease 
progression who cross over to combination treatment will undergo the same efficacy and safety assessments as the main cohort. 
The purpose of Part 2C is to gather preliminary efficacy information regarding BMS- 986207 in combination with 
nivolumab and  ipi[INVESTIGATOR_499720],  treatment -naive NSCLC whose tumors express  
to assess optimal dose selection for RP2D. These subjects will be treated with BMS -986207 q3w at a dose not to 
exceed  the dose declared  tolerable  in Part 1C, nivolumab 360 mg q3w,  and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]  1 mg/kg q6w.  Additional  doses 
lower than the dose declared tolerable might be tested for dose optimization in Part 2C.  
Part 2C may begin  once  there  is sufficient  safety  data from  a minimum  of 6 participants  in Part 1C. 
Continuous  e
 valuation  of toxicity  events  will also be performed  in this part of the study  If, at any time,  the aggregate 
rate of treatment- related toxicities meeting DLT criteria exceeds 33%, the findings will be discussed and further 
enrollment  may be interrupted.  Depending  on the nature  and grade  of the toxicity,  and after assessing the risk/benefit 
ratio, a new dose for all participants may be initiated at a lower dose level.  
Participants with an outcome of unconfirmed progressive disease, stable disease (SD), partial response (PR), or 
complete response (CR) at the end of a given cycle will continue to the next treatment cycle. Participants will be allowed to continue study treatment until the first occurrence of either: 1) completion of the maximum number of 
cycles,  2) confirmed  PD, 3) clinical  deterioration  suggesting that no further benefit  from  treatment  is likely,  
4) intolerability to therapy, or 5) the participant meets criteria for discontinuation of study therapy. Individual 
participants with confirmed CR will be given the option to discontinue study therapy on a case -by-case basis after 
specific  consultation  and agreement  between  the investigator  and BMS  Medical  Monitor in settings  where  benefit/risk 
justify discontinuation of study therapy.  
Dose Limiting  Toxicities: For the purpose  of guiding  dose escalation,  DLTs  will be defined  based  on the incidence, 
intensity, and duration of adverse events (AEs) for which no clear alternative cause is identified. DLT period will be 
28 days (4 weeks) in Part 1A and Part 1B and 42 days (6 weeks) in Part 1C.  
For the purpose  of participant  management,  any AE that meets  DLT criteria,  regardless  of the cycle in which  it occurs, 
will lead to discontinuation  of study drug unless  the investigator  determines  that [ADDRESS_643330] be discontinued 
due to toxicity attributed to  that agent alone.  Participants experiencing  a DLT will  not be retreated with study drug,

participants who withdraw from the study during the DLT evaluation interval for reasons other than a DLT may be 
replaced with a new participant at the same dose level.  
Treatment  with  Additional Cycles  beyond 24 Weeks:  Participants  in Parts  1A, 1B, 2A, or 2B with ongoing  disease 
control  (CR,  PR, SD) or unconfirmed progressive  disease,  and completing  approximately  24 weeks  of treatment,  may 
be eligible for an additional 3 cycles of study therapy in both the monotherapy (Parts 1A and 2A) and combination 
therapy (Parts 1B and 2B) parts beyond the initial 24 weeks, at discretion of the Investigator and BMS Medical 
Monitor.  Upon  completion  of 3 cycles  of study  therapy  (or up to a maximum  of 6 cycles  if applicable),  all participants 
will enter the safety follow -up period.  
The cohort expansion phase  of the study  is shown  in the figure  below.  
Schematic of Dose Escalation  and Cohort  Expansion  Phases of the Study  
Prior  to initiating  Part 1A (Monotherapy - Dose  Escalation),  a preliminary  safety  cohort will be tested  in which  a single 
participant will undergo an intra -participant dose escalation to establish safety over the [ADDRESS_643332] dose escalation panels as monotherapy and combination therapy with nivolumab 
will proceed as described below.

FOLLOW -UP PERIODS  
Safety Follow- up: After  the end -of-treatment (EOT) visit, all participants will be evaluated for  any new AEs for at 
least [ADDRESS_643333] dose of therapy. Follow -up visits will occur at Day 30, 60, and 100 ( ± 7 days) after the 
last dose or date of discontinuation.  
Survival Follow -up: In parallel with the safety  follow -up period, participants in Parts 1A, 1B, 2A and 2B will enter 
the survival follow -up period. Participants will be followed by [CONTACT_119570] 12 weeks from discontinuation of 
study drug/EOT  visit for a period  of [ADDRESS_643334]. Survival follow -up visits will occur every 
12 weeks (±7 days) until [ADDRESS_643335] dose of study drug.  
Response Follow -up: Participants  with SD, PR, or CR at the time of study  drug discontinuation  will continue  to have 
radiologic  and clinical tumor  assessments every [ADDRESS_643336] year  after discontinuation of study drug/EOT 
visit. Subsequently, they will continue to receive tumor assessment scans per standard -of-care guidelines, or, at a 
minimum, every [ADDRESS_643337] dose of study drug, or until disease progression or 
withdrawal of study consent.  
Retreatment:  Retreatment  may be allowed  for participants  in Parts  1A, 1B, 2A, or 2B with disease  progression  during 
response  follow -up. Participants  completing  approximately  3 cycles  of study  therapy  (or up to a maximum  of 6 cycles, 
if applicable),  and entering  the response  follow -up with ongoing disease control  (CR,  PR, or SD), may be eligible  for 
retreatment.

In Parts 1A, 1B, 2A, and 2B, the initial treatment period is up to 24 weeks (3 cycles) of dosing and the number of 8 - 
week cycles will depend on tumor  assessment at each cycle. Following each  treatment cycle, the decision to  treat a 
participant with the next cycle of study  therapy, up to a maximum of 48 weeks (6 cycles) of treatment, will be based 
on safety/benefit and tumor assessment. For Parts 1C and 2C, the treatment period is up to a maximum of 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Upon completion of these treatment, participants will 
enter a safety follow -up period.  
Details of the dose escalation and cohort expansion phase in this study  are given in the study design section and the 
schematic above.  For Parts  1A, 1B, 2A and 2B intra-participant  dose escalation/reduction  of BMS -986207,  nivolumab, 
or ipi[INVESTIGATOR_499721]. For intra -participant dose reduction of BMS -986207 in Part 1C and 2C see 
Section [IP_ADDRESS]  and Section [IP_ADDRESS], respectively.  
Study treatment  will be dispensed at the study  visits.  For participants  on combination  treatment,  a 30-minute  infusion 
of nivolumab will be followed  by a 30-minute  observation  period,  followed  by a 60-minute  infusion  of BMS -986207, 
with a 60 -minute observation period after all infusions in Cycle 1 for each participant. For participants <  42 kg 
receiving  the 1600- mg dose of BMS -986207 or <38 kg receiving  the 1200 -mg dose of BMS -986207,  the infusion  time 
will be longer than 1 hour.  For participants  in Part 1C or Part 2C, a 30-minute  infusion  of nivolumab  will be followed 
by a 30-minute  observation  period;  followed  by a 30-minute  infusion  of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125],  a 30-minute  observation period, 
and by a 60- minute infusion of BMS -986207.  
Treatment  Assignment : In this open -label  study,  no blinding  will be required.  Enrolled  participants  will be assigned 
sequential participant numbers via IRT starting with  (eg, ). Enrolled  participants 
meeting  the inclusion  criteria  will be eligible  to be dosed.  In the expansion  phase  only,  participants  with CRC will be 
randomized in a 1:1 manner to either BMS -986207 monotherapy or combination therapy with BMS -986207 and 
nivolumab to eliminate the possibility of enrollment bias.  
 
STUDY  ASSESSMENTS AND  ANALYSES: 
Safety Assessments: Safety assessments will be based on  reported AEs and the  measurement  results of vital signs, 
ECGs, physical examinations,  and clinical laboratory tests.  AEs will be coded using the most current version of the 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and the incidence of observed AEs will be tabulated and 
reviewed for potential significance and clinical importance. AEs will be assessed continuously  during the study and 
for [ADDRESS_643339] dose of BMS -986207, nivolumab, and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_499722]. A central/local 
laboratory will perform  the clinical laboratory tests and will provide reference ranges for these tests. Both AEs and 
laboratory  tests will be graded  using  the National  Cancer  Institute  Common  Terminology  Criteria  for Adverse  Events 
v4.03.

 PK Assessments: Pharmacokinetics  of BMS -986207  will be derived  from  serum  concentration  versus  time data.  The 
pharmacokinetic parameters that will be assessed, following the intensive PK collection, are: maximum observed 
serum concentration (Cmax), time of maximum observed serum concentration (Tmax), area under the plasma concentration -time curve (AUC) from time zero to the time of the last quantifiable concentration (AUC[0 -T]), AUC 
in 1 dosing interval (AUC[tau]), observed concentration at the end of a dosing interval (Ctau), total body clearance 
(CLT), average concentration over a dosing  interval (Css -avg), accumulation index (AI), effective elimination half - 
life that explains the degree of accumulation observed for a specific exposure measure (T -HALFeff),  
. Individual participant PK parameter values will be 
derived  by [CONTACT_499795] a validated  PK analysis  program.  Actual  times  will be used for the analyses.  
Immunogenicity  Assessments: Serum  samples  for BMS -986207,  anti-drug antibody 
(ADA) will be collected from all participants at specified time points.  
Efficacy  Assessments : Efficacy  assessments for the  activity  of BMS -986207,  alone,  in combination  with 
nivolumab,  or in combination  with nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_499723],  using  RECIST

a End of treatment (EOT) is defined as the visit where the decision is made to discontinue the participant from treatment. Evaluations will be performed prior to 
study discharge, or for participants who are prematurely discontinued.  
b For participants  who complete  all scheduled  cycles  of therapy,  the EOT  visit will be the same as the last scheduled and completed on -treatment  visit (eg, Cycle 
3 Day 43) and the start of the safety  follow -up period.  For participants  that do not complete all scheduled  cycles  of therapy,  the EOT  visit will be the most recent 
on-treatment visit (with all available safety and response data), does not need to be repeated and will be considered the start of the safety follow -up period.  
c Obtainment of vital signs  surrounding  study  drug administration(s)  from  Cycle  2 on as per institutional  practice/Investigator  discretion.  
d ECGs  should be recorded  after the participant  has been  supi[INVESTIGATOR_221865] 5 minutes,  and prior to blood  draws. Single  safety  ECGs  to be done  on Day 1 and Day 
29 of all treatment cycles where ECG not performed in conjunction with PK sampling.  
e There  will be a 72-hour window  for collection  of all laboratory  tests. See  Section  9.4.4  and Table  9.4.4-1 . 
f Serum/urine to be collected within [ADDRESS_643355] be performed within 24 hours prior to administration of  study drug (urine pregnancy test: 
minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of hCG).  
g Same imaging modality to be used for all assessments, per RECIST v1.1 ( Appendix 5). Tumor assessment to be performed prior to initiating next cycle of 
treatment. Unconfirmed PR/CR must be confirmed at least 4 weeks after initial assessment finding ( Section 9.4.5)

 3. INTRODUCTION  
This is a Phase 1/2a, first -in-human (FIH), dose escalation study of BMS -986207, an anti -T cell 
immunoglobulin  (Ig) and immunoreceptor tyrosine -based  inhibitory  motif (ITIM) domain (TIGIT) 
monoclonal antibody (mAb), alone, in combination with nivolumab (anti -programmed cell death 
1 [PD -1]), and in combination with nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (anti -cytotoxic T -lymphocyte 
associated protein 4 [CTLA -4] antibody) in humans with advanced solid tumors. 
3.1 Study Rationale  
Antibody- based  therapy for cancer  is well established  and constitutes  an important strategy  for the 
treatment of patients with hematological malignancies and solid tumors.  1 In addition to the 
targeting of antigens involved in cancer cell proliferation and survival, antibodies can function 
either to activate or antagonize immunological pathways involved in cancer  immune surveillance. 
The anti -cancer, antigen -specific immune response is the result of a complex dynamic interplay 
between antigen -presenting cells, T -lymphocyte cells, and the target cancer cells.2 The critical 
balance of T cell activity  that dictates  whether endogenous anti- cancer immune  responses will be

TIGIT is a 26 -kDa type I transmembrane immunoglobulin superfamily member with a single 
extracellular IgV domain, an intracellular domain containing immunoglobulin tail  tyrosine motif 
and ITIM,  and a growth factor  receptor-bound protein binding  site. In healthy  individuals,  TIGIT 
is expressed on a subset of memory  CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and on the majority of regulatory  T 
cells (Tregs)  and NK cells.  In the settings  of chronic viral infections  and cancer,  TIGIT  is strongly  
upregulated on CD8+ T cells and has been associated with other  of T cell exhaustion, 
including PD-1, CTLA -4, lymphocyte- activation  gene 3 (LAG -3), and T cell immunoglobulin and 
mucin domain -containing -3 (TIM -3).7,8 In human tumors, TIGIT is expressed on the majority  of 
tumor- infiltrating Tregs and CD8+ T cells, and to a lesser extent on CD4+ T effectors.8 
TIGIT  ligands poliovirus  receptor  (PVR) and  Nectin -2 are highly expressed  on many tumors and 
tumor- infiltrating  myeloid  cells, and likely contribute  to the immunosuppressive  tumor

 microenvironment.  Upon ligand engagement,  TIGIT  can partially  suppress T cell and natural killer 
(NK) cell activation . 9 Furthermore, TIGIT agonism leads to Treg stabilization and increased 
interleukin 10 production by [CONTACT_185539].10,11 TIGIT competes for ligand binding with costimulatory 
receptor DNAX accessory molecule 1 (DNAM- 1, also CD226), which has been shown to be 
involved in tumor immune  surveillance, and TIGIT  co-expression  on the cell surface  has been  
linked to decreased  DNAM -1 signaling.8,12 
In ex vivo experiments using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from melanoma 
patients, antibody blockade of  TIGIT/PVR interaction on  tumor antigen -stimulated CD8+ T cells 
resulted in increased proliferation and cytokine production. This activity was further enhanced when  combined with PD-1 blockade.
13Comparable studies were  conducted using PBMC from  
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive patients with similar results.[ADDRESS_643381] shown that TIGIT  blockade on NK cells results  in increased  activation  and lysis of 
PVR- expressing tumor cells in a DNAM- 1 expression dependent manner. BMS -986207, a fully 
human anti- TIGIT  mAb,  was designed with an inert isotype (termed  IgG1.1) to eliminate  fragment 
crystallizable region (Fc) effector function, which is intended to increase anti- tumor immune 
response by [CONTACT_499800] -1 co-stimulation on 
intra-tumoral CD8+ T cells. Based on preclinical models, blockade of PD1/programmed death - 
ligand 1 (PD -L1) pathway is expected to enhance or synergize with TIGIT blockade. 
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of 
intravenous (IV) doses of BMS -986207, administered as monotherapy, in combination with 
nivolumab, and as of Protocol Amendment 03, in combination with nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], in participants  with  advanced solid  tumors.  This  study will also determine  the maximum tolerated

details).
16 In addition, recent data presented from a Phase 1 study ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) of the anti - 
TIGIT antibody vibostolimab plus pembrolizumab in participants with anti -PD-(L)1-naive 
NSCLC demonstrated anti -tumor activity (ORR 29% and 46% in patients with PDL1 -positive

3.2 Background  
3.2.1 BMS- 986207 
BMS -986207 is a fully human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) mAb that binds with high affinity to 
TIGIT (T cell immunoreceptor with immunoglobulin and immunoreceptor tyrosine -based 
inhibitory motif domain), a negative regulatory  molecule  that suppresses activation  and functional 
responses in T cells and NK cells.  The antibody is engineered  to negate Fc gamma  receptor  (FcγR) 
binding by [CONTACT_499802] 5 specific amino  acid mutations.  TIGIT  upregulation has been 
observed in cancer patients, in particular on T cells and is co- expressed with   of T cell 
exhaustion. Binding of PVR and Nectin- 2 (TIGIT ligands) to TIGIT results  in suppression of T 
cell and NK cell function. Blockade of TIGIT therefore may increase the immune anti -tumor 
response both by [CONTACT_499803]226 (DNAM -1), which shares these ligands. BMS - 
986207 blocks interaction  of TIGIT  with its ligands and thereby [CONTACT_499804]- tumor 
immune responses.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Nonclinical Pharmacology  
BMS -986207 binds  recombinant TIGIT  with  an equilibrium dissociation  constant (K D) of 
and to cell surface TIGIT on activated CD8+ T cells with  a half -maximal effective concentration 
(EC50) of  . The antibody binds to recombinant cynomolgus monkey TIGIT with and 
EC50  of and to activated  cynomolgus monkey CD8+  T with an EC50  of 
BMS -986207 inhibits the binding of PVR and Nectin -2 to TIGIT  in a dose-dependent manner with 
an EC50 of  . BMS -986207 blocked the inhibitory activity of TIGIT/PVR interaction in a 
Jurkat cell line reporter assay, a T cell peptide stimulation assay, and an NK cell  redirected lysis 
assay.  In the Jurkat and NK cell assays,  TIGIT  blockade alone resulted  in increased  nuclear  factor - 
kappa- B (NF -κB) luciferase signals and increased lysis of  target cells, respectively. In the T cell 
peptide stimulation assay, the effect of  TIGIT blockade  was strongest when  combined with PD-1 
blockade, and resulted  in increased  interferon  gamma  (IFN γ) secretion  and an elevated  percentage 
of IFN γ−producing T cells. 
Due to its engineered inert Fc region, as expected, BMS -986207 does  not induce antibody - 
dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) - or antibody- dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) - 
mediated killing of TIGIT -expressing target cells. In addition, BMS -986207 does not bind 
complement 1q (C1q). Based on these findings, BMS -986207- induced depletion of TIGIT - 
expressing cells is not expected. BMS -986207 showed no unexpected binding in 8 cynomolgus

that BMS -986207 treatment does not lead to cytokine release syndrome (CRS) in whole blood. 
A number of mouse studies were undertaken to examine the role of TIGIT blockade in tumor 
settings. An MC38 colon adenocarcinoma murine tumor study in PD -1/TIGIT double knockout 
(KO) mice suggested dual blockade of TIGIT and PD -1 may be beneficial in the treatment of 
cancer through enhanced antitumor immunity. PD -1/TIGIT double KO mice showed superior 
tumor rejection as compared to the other groups. There were no tumor -free mice in the groups of 
TIGIT KO mice or wild -type mice. In the CT26 colon murine tumor model and the A20 B cell 
lymphoma murine model, TIGIT blockade with a surrogate antibody in combination with PD -1 
blockade or CTLA -4 by [CONTACT_499805] -tumor responses. In these models, 
the combination  of PD-1 blockade or CTLA -4 blockade with TIGIT  blockade resulted  in a greater 
number of tumor -free mice than either agent alone.  
The in vitro and in vivo data indicating that TIGIT blockade can enhance T cell and NK cell activation, and that TIGIT blockade (together with PD -1 or CTLA -4 blockade) enhances anti - 
tumor immune activity, support the development of BMS-986207 for the treatment of cancer. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Nonclinical Pharmacokinetics  
The pharmacokinetics (PK)  of BMS -986207 were  evaluated  in cynomolgus monkeys in 2 studies 
Following a single IV dose of 1, 10, and 100 mg/kg 
or 0.5 and 3 mg/kg BMS -986207 serum  concentrations exhibited biexponential 
decline, dose-proportional increase in systemic exposure, low total body serum clearance ( 
), low volume of distribution at steady -state and long 
apparent half -life The Vss is similar  to the reported  plasma  volume in 
monkeys, indicating limited extravascular distribution. The presence of anti -drug antibodies 
(ADAs) was observed in all except 1 monkeys. Anti -drug- antibodies were detected as early as 
Day 7 and their appearance appeared to correlate with an accelerated decline in BMS -986207 
serum concentrations.  
In mice, a dose dependent tumor efficacy was observed with a combination of 10A7- mIgG1 
D265A (anti-mouse TIGIT  with a D265A mutated  inert mIgG1  isotype; the surrogate antibody for 
BMS -986207) and 4H2- mIgG1 D265A (mAb to mouse PD -1 Clone 4H2, isotype mouse IgG1- 
D265A); either  antibody had little or no tumor efficacy.  Therefore,  PK of 10A7- mIgG1  D265A in 
combination with  4H2 -mIgG1  D265A were  evaluated  in mice. After multiple intraperitoneal (IP) 
doses of 10A7 -mIgG1  D265 (10 mg/kg) alone  or in combination  with anti-mPD -1-mIgG1  D265A 
(7.5 mg/kg) at 0.3, 1, and 3 mg/kg to female BALB/c mice bearing CT26 tumors, 10A7-mIgG1 
D265A
 exhibited  a dose-proportional increase  in exposure.  Fitting  the exposures  to a 
1-compartment PK model with an absorption compartment yielded an estimated apparent CLTs  
.

 1-month intermittent repeat- dose IV toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys. The cynomolgus 
monkey was selected as the toxicology species because BMS -986207 binds to TIGIT expressed 
on activated cynomolgus monkey T cells with a similar affinity  as TIGIT expressed on activated 
human T cells and is pharmacologically  
active in monkeys; it does not bind rodent TIGIT.  
In a Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) -compliant tissue cross -reactivity study in normal human 
tissues fluoresceinated BMS -[ADDRESS_643387]  non-lymphoid tissues.  This staining  was 
expected  based  on TIGIT  expression  by [CONTACT_499806], such  as T cells  and NK cells.  No 
unexpected tissue cross -reactivity  was observed. BMS -986207 did not induce cytokine release or 
increase the expression  of activation   on human T, B, or NK cells in an in vitro  human 
peripheral blood mononuclear cell cytokine release  and cell activation  assay,  suggesting a low risk 
of BMS -986207-induced CRS  in humans.  
In a 1-month pi[INVESTIGATOR_499731], BMS -986207 was administered  IV as a slow bolus 
at doses of 0, 10, 30, or 100 mg/kg (once  weekly  [qw] × 5 doses).  BMS -986207 was clinically  well 
tolerated by [CONTACT_499807] 30 and 100 mg/kg doses while 3 out of  10 monkeys in the 10 mg/kg 
dose group exhibited signs of  ADA mediated  hypersensitivity reactions immediately  after dosing 
on study days 22 and/or 29 (fourth and/or fifth dose). The clinical signs were transient, 
accompanied  by [CONTACT_499808], and no treatment 
was required for the affected monkeys. The timing, type of clinical observations, correlative complement activation are consistent  with the formation of treatment -emergent ADA, a common 
response by [CONTACT_499809] a foreign protein. This immunogenicity is not considered  to be predictive 
for
 ADA responses  in humans  (International  Council  for Harmonisation  of Technical  
Requirements for  Pharmaceuticals for Human  Use [ICH]  S6).  responses  were 
observed at all doses and included NK cell activation  and CD8+  T cell activation  and proliferation, 
and were  generally dose-independent. Based  on the lack of directly  BMS -986207- related adverse 
findings, the no-observed-adverse- effect level (NOAEL) was considered to be  
. In addition, for determination of the maximum 
re
commended human starting dose, was also considered  the highest non- severely  toxic 
dose (HNSTD). The HNSTD/NOAEL of   than the proposed 
starting  dose in humans (1 mg/kg) with a  corresponding plasma   of the 
projected human AUC (0-336),ss at 1 mg/kg 
 
Overall, the nonclinical toxicology assessment of BMS -986207 has demonstrated an acceptable 
safety profile, supporting clinical use in oncology patients.

 combination with nivolumab. BMS -986207 was evaluated  as a monotherapy at doses ranging from 
20 mg to 1600 mg q2w (20 mg: n = 3; 80 mg: n = 3; 240 mg: n = 4; 800 mg: n = 28; 1600 mg: n 
= 4.). A single participant was dosed using an intra -participant dose escalation approach at 2, 6, 
and 20 mg. Escalation  in this participant occurred 2 weeks after each dose with continued treatment 
at 20 mg  q2w. There  was no relationship  between  the incidence,  severity,  or causality  of AEs  and 
BMS -986207 dose level.  A majority  of treatment -related  AEs were  of Grade  1 to Grade  2, with 5 
treatment- related Grade 3 to Grade 4 AEs (Grade 3 elevated aspartate aminotransferase, n = 1; 
Grade 3 hypertension, n = 1; Grade 3 hyponatremia, n = 2; Grade 3 hyperglycemia, n = 1). 
Infusion- related AEs were reported in 1 participant, which were managed based on the updated 
protocol guidelines. There  were  no drug- related  SAEs  with monotherapy. A total of 26 deaths were 
reported in participants treated with BMS -986207 monotherapy. All deaths were due to 
complications from disease progression except  for 1 death  attributed  to aspi[INVESTIGATOR_499732]. All 
were considered by [CONTACT_499810]. 
The safety  profile  of BMS -986207 in combination  with nivolumab was evaluated  at the following 
doses: 80 mg BMS -986207 + 240 mg nivolumab q2w (n = 4), 240 mg BMS -986207 + 240 mg 
nivolumab q2w (n = 4), 480 mg BMS -986207 + 480 mg nivolumab q4w (n = 18), and 1600 mg 
BMS -986207 + 480 mg nivolumab q4w (n = 4). There  was no relationship  between  the incidence, 
severity,  or causality  of AEs and the combination regimen  dose levels.  Most  AEs were  of Grade  [ADDRESS_643388] -2021, the safety profile of BMS -[PHONE_10376] mg Q3W in combination with 
nivolumab 360 mg Q3W and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 1 mg/kg Q6W was assessed in 6 participants. Of the 6 
treated participants (the first participant was a sentinel participant), 4 participants were DLT evaluable. Based on preliminary data, 2 out of the 4 DLT -evaluable participants reported 
experiencing DLTs. One participant was a 79 -year-old female with second- line (2L) pancreatic 
cancer  who was reported to have Grade  3 encephalitis.  The patient received  the triplet  combination 
once on Day 1. On Day 22, treatment  was held for Grade  2 pneumonitis, which  began on Day 12. 
On Day 40, treatment was discontinued due to disease progression. On Day 41, Grade 3 encephalitis, a DLT, was reported, treated with corticosteroids and mycophenolate mofetil, and had improved to Grade 2 on Day 53. The participant died on Day 118 due to disease progression.

 3.2.2 Nivolumab  
Nivolumab (also referred to as BMS -936558, MDX1106, or ONO -4538) is a human monoclonal 
antibody (immunoglobulin G4 [IgG4]-S228P) that targets the programmed death -1 (PD-1) cluster 
of differentiation 279 (CD279) cell surface membrane receptor. PD -1 is a negative regulatory 
molecule expressed by [CONTACT_93247] T and B lymphocytes. Binding of PD -1 to its ligands, 
programmed death–ligands 1 (PD -L1) and 2 (PD -L2), results in the down- regulation of 
lymphocyte activation. Inhibition of the interaction between PD -1 and its ligands promotes 
immune responses and antigen -specific T cell responses to both foreign antigens as well as self - 
antigens. Nivolumab is expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and is produced using 
standard mammalian cell cultivation and chromatographic purification technologies. The clinical study product is a sterile solution for parenteral administration.  
Nivolumab is approved for the treatment of  several types of  cancer in multiple regions including 
the [LOCATION_002] (US, Dec -2014), the European Union (EU, Jun-2015), and Japan (Jul-2014). 
Nivolumab has demonstrated durable responses exceeding 6 months as monotherapy in several 
tumor types, including NSCLC, melanoma, renal cell carcinoma (RCC), Classical Hodgkin 
Lymphoma (cHL),  small -cell lung cancer  (SCLC),  gastric  cancer,  squamous  cell carcinoma of the 
head and neck (SCCHN), urothelial cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and CRC. In confirmatory trials, nivolumab as monotherapy demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in OS as compared with the current standard of care in patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC, unresectable or metastatic melanoma, advanced RCC, or recurrent or metastatic SCCHN. Details of the clinical activity in these various malignancies are provided in  
the US prescribing  information  (USPI) and Summary  of Product Characteristics  (SmPC).

For nivolumab monotherapy, the safety profile is similar across tumor types. The only exception 
is pulmonary inflammation  adverse events  (AEs),  which may be numerically greater  in participants 
with NSCLC.  In NSCLC patients,  it can be difficult to distinguish between  nivolumab- related  and 
unrelated causes of pulmonary symptoms and radiographic changes. There is no relationship between the incidence, severity, or causality of AEs and the nivolumab dose level. Additional details on the safety profile of nivolumab, including results from other clinical studies, are summarized in the nivolumab Investigators Brochure.  
3.2.3 Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_499733] (BMS -734016, MDX010, MDX -CTLA4) is a fully human monoclonal 
immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 kappa specific for human cytotoxic T -lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA -4, 
cluster of  differentiation [CD] 152), which is expressed on a subset of activated T cells. CTLA -4 
is a negative regulator of T cell activity.  Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_103955] a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds to 
CTLA -4 and blocks the interaction  of CTLA-4 with its ligands, CD80/CD86.  Blockade of CTLA -

T-regulatory cell (Treg) function, which may contribute to a general increase in T cell 
responsiveness, including the anti-tumor response.

3.3 Benefit/Risk Assessment  
Through the CA020002 study, some initial evidence of clinical benefit has been observed in 
patients with  advanced  cancer  especially  when  used in combination with  PD-[ADDRESS_643391] shown similar clinical benefit when used in 
combination with PD -1/PD -L1 inhibitors.15,16 Prior to these studies, the evaluation of risk was 
based on information from nonclinical studies with BMS -986207 in monkeys ( Section [IP_ADDRESS]) 
and potential effects based on the proposed mechanism of action. The nonclinical toxicology assessment  of BMS -986207 has demonstrated an acceptable safety  profile,  supporting clinical  use 
in oncology patients.  Because BMS -986207 blocks interaction of  TIGIT with nectin -2 or PVR, it 
has the potential to remove  an inhibitory signal to T cells and NK cells.  TIGIT  expression is limited 
to lymphoid cells, so the principal effects are anticipated to be related to the effects of inflammatory cells in specific tissues. Similar to other Immuno -Oncology (I- O) drugs, a general  
principle is to monitor for immune -mediated adverse reactions in various organ systems. 
Noninflammatory  etiologies  should be considered and discussions with the BMS  Medical  Monitor 
should be used to guide treatment. Consultation with a medical or surgical specialist, especially 
prior to an invasive diagnostic or therapeutic procedure, is recommended. 
In vitro treatment of human mononuclear cells with BMS -[ADDRESS_643392] the potential to induce anti -idiotype 
antibodies that can be neutralizing or non- neutralizing. BMS -986207 is a fully human antibody 
and the clinical  experience with other human mAb I -O agents  is that infusion- related reactions or 
hypersensitivity reactions occur at a frequency of < 10% and are generally low grade. Severe 
infusion- related  reactions  or anaphylaxis are rare and occur at a frequency of approximately 0.1%. 
For the proposed clinical study of BMS -986207, the administration will start with a single 
participant  enrolled into monotherapy escalation,  receiving  BMS -[ADDRESS_643393] 20 mg dose.

In combination therapy, BMS -986207 may potentiate  immune -mediated  adverse reactions caused 
by [CONTACT_104081][INVESTIGATOR_125]. The safety profile of nivolumab monotherapy is well defined and 
is based  on experience with greater  than 23,500 patients  evaluated  in clinical  trials.  The frequency

Overall, the safety profiles of nivolumab monotherapy, ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79285], and the 
combination of the two are manageable and generally consistent across completed and ongoing 
clinical trials. There was no MTD reached at any  dose of  nivolumab tested up to 10 mg/kg. Most 
AEs were low -grade (Grade 1 to 2) with relatively few related high -grade (Grade 3 to 4) AEs. 
There  was no pattern  in the incidence,  severity, or causality  of AEs with respect  to nivolumab dose 
level.  
A pattern  of immune -related AEs has been  defined, for which  management  algorithms  have been 
developed; these are provided in Appendix 6. Most high -grade events were manageable with  the 
use of corticosteroids or hormone replacement therapy (endocrinopathies) as instructed in these algorithms.

Section [IP_ADDRESS] for more details).
19 Per BOIN design, BMS -986207 dose of 1200 mg Q3W was 
reduced to 600 mg due to the reported DLTs. If needed, BMS -986207 dosing will be further 
reduced  in the setting  of SAEs  or worsening AE profiles.  When  BMS -986207 was combined with 
nivolumab, participants with melanoma (1 participant with a complete response [CR], 2 participants with partial response [PR]), and prostate cancer (1 participant with PR) experienced clinical  benefit (unpublished results).  When  1200 mg BMS -986207 was combined with nivolumab 
and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (n = 6 treated participants), PR was observed in one participant with CRC and stable disease (SD) with NSCLC (post PD -1 therapy). No clinical benefit was observed in any

5. STUDY DESIGN  
5.1 Overall Design  
This is a Phase 1/2a, open -label study of BMS -986207, administered as a single agent, in 
combination with nivolumab, and in combination with both nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_499738].  The duration of the study will be approximately 6 years.  
The study comprises 2 parts.  Part 1 includes dose escalation  of BMS -986207 alone (Part 1A) and 
in combination with nivolumab (Part 1B) to determine the MTD/RP2D, as well as a select dose 
level  of BMS -986207 in combination with nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]  (Part 1C) to evaluate safety 
and preliminary  activity of the triplet combination. Part 1B includes a substudy 
conducted at a single site under site-specific Amendments 6, 7, and 8 to evaluate the safety  and 
preliminary  efficacy  of BMS -986207 in combination  with nivolumab  in PD-1 naive  and 
relapsed/refractory  participants with melanoma.  Part 2 includes expansion cohorts to gather 
additional preliminary   activity,  as well as additional safety,  tolerability,  PK,  
information for BMS -986207 alone (Part 2A), in combination with nivolumab 
(Part 2B), and in combination  with nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_499708] (Part 2C). Participants 
in each study  phase will complete  up to 4 periods in the study: screening,  treatment,  safety  follow- 
up, and response/survival follow- up. The overall study design is shown in Figure [IP_ADDRESS]-1. 
5.1.1 Screening  Period  
The screening  period for all parts  of the study will be up to 28 days, and begins by [CONTACT_499813]’s  initial eligibility  and signing of the informed  consent  form  (ICF).  See Appendix 2 for 
details of the informed consent process and other study governance considerations. Participants 
will be enrolled using an Interactive Response Technology (IRT), and  the screening assessments 
are shown in Table 2 -1. 
If a participant  exceeds the 28-day screening  period due to a study- related  procedure 
(eg, scheduling of a  or waiting for a study -related  laboratory value), the participant 
must be re-consented, but does not require a new participant identification  number. In this 
situation,  the f ewest  number of procedures from  the initial  screening  should be repeated  to qualify 
the participant, while maintaining participant safety and eligibility.  
5.1.2 Treatment  Period  
Treatment  cohorts are illustrated  in Figure [IP_ADDRESS]-2 . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Treatment  in Parts  1A, 1B,  2A, and 2B 
Participants will be treated for up to 24 weeks (3 cycles) with monotherapy as will participants treated  with combination  therapy (Parts  1B and 2B). The treatment period  will consist of up to 
3 treatment cycles of 8 weeks. Following each treatment cycle,  the decision to treat a participant 
with additional cycles of study therapy (up to a maximum of 6 cycles), will be based on tumor assessment at the end of each cycle. Weekly study visits will be performed for the first [ADDRESS_643402] dose of study drug, followed by [CONTACT_319650] q2w thereafter.

participants < 42 kg on the 1600 mg dose, the infusion time will be longer than 1 hour (approximately 90 minutes; see Pharmacy Manual for more detail). In Parts 1B and 2B, each combination treatment cycle will  comprise [ADDRESS_643404] 30 minutes after completion of the infusion of 
nivolumab.  
Additional infusion details are given in the Pharmacy Manual. Tumor progression and response 
endpoints will be assessed using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 
criteria for solid tumors (Appendix 5 ). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Treatment in Part 1C and Part 2C  
In Part 1C (Triplet cohort) and Part 2C (Triplet NSCLC Expansion), each treatment cycle is equal 
to 6 weeks. Nivolumab (360 mg) will be administered every  3 weeks and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (1 mg/kg) 
will be administered  every  [ADDRESS_643405] 30 minutes  after completion  of the nivolumab infusion. 
BMS -986207 will be administered every 3 weeks at 600 mg and/or 360 mg and will be tested in 
Part 1C per BOIN design and for dose optimization. A dose not to exceed the dose declared 
tolerable  in Part 1C will be used in Part 2C. Additional doses lower  than the dose declared  tolerable 
in Part 1C might be tested for dose optimization in Part 2C. A dose of 1200 mg BMS -986207 
administered  every  3 weeks has been  tested  per Amendment 03 but due to the DLTs  observed no 
additional participants will be tested at this dose (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]).  
Treatment  will occur until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or other reasons as specified 
in Section 8.[ADDRESS_643406] v1.1 
defined progression is  permitted  if the participant  has investigator -assessed  clinical benefit and is 
tolerating the treatment, as specified in Section 5.1.4.

 [IP_ADDRESS] Preliminary Safety Cohort & Dose Escalation (Part 1A  and 1B) 
Approximately 35 participants are expected to be treated during each dose escalation part of  the 
study guided by [CONTACT_499794] (BLRM). Each participant will be 
administered IV doses of BMS -986207 per the cohort assignment as follows: 
• The Preliminary Safety Cohort precedes participant enrollment in Monotherapy - Dose 
Escalation (Part 1A) of the study. The first participant enrolled into monotherapy  escalation 
will receive BMS -[ADDRESS_643408] 20 mg dose. No other intra -participant 
dose escalation is planned for this study. If there are no DLTs or other safety concerns 
observed, an additional  2 participants will be enrolled in the 20 mg dose cohort. Please refer 
to Appendix 13 for complete details of the Preliminary Safety Cohort  
• In Part 1A (monotherapy dose escalation), the planned flat dose levels for BMS -986207 are 
20, 80, 240, 800 and 1600 mg (assuming  an 80kg participant)  q2w, in 8-week  cycles,  for up to 
3 cycles of study therapy (24 weeks). In addition, a q4w schedule of BMS -986207 will be 
evaluated  at flat doses of  480 mg  and 1600 mg  (assuming an 80kg participant).  Enrollment of 
the first q4w cohort will be guided by [CONTACT_395494], PK, analysis from the q2w 
cohorts. Following each treatment cycle, the decision to treat a participant with additional cycles of  study  therapy (up to a maximum of 6 cycles), will be based on tumor assessment at 
the end of each cycle.  
• In Part 1B, (combination therapy dose escalation), BMS -986207 and nivolumab will be 
administered  at flat doses of 80 and 240 mg BMS -986207 q2w with 240 mg nivolumab q2w. 
In addition, BMS -986207 will be administered at flat doses of 480 and 1600 mg q4w in 
combination with  nivolumab administered at 480 mg q4w. Study drugs will be administered 
in 8- week cycles, for up to 3 cycles of study therapy (24 weeks). Following each treatment 
cycle, the decision to treat a participant with additional cycles of study therapy (up to a 
maximum of 6 cycles), will be based on tumor assessment at the end of each cycle.  
 
Planned dose levels  and dose schedules of BMS -986207 and/or nivolumab may be modified, and 
intermediate dose levels of BMS -986207 added, based upon the BLRM analysis and/or sponsor 
discretion  and discussion  with  the Investigators.  Once  the safety  (during the  DLT  evaluation) of a 
dose level  has been  established  (Part  1A and/or Part 1B), additional participants (up to 15) may be 
added at that dose, to better characterize the safety,  dose schedule, PK,  profile  
assessments.  Part 1B combination dose escalation  will be initiated  after at least [ADDRESS_643409] 
tolerated dose in Part 1A. Escalation within Parts  1A and 1B, within the constraints cited above, 
may be done in parallel.

Sentinel  Participant  
During the dose escalation phase,  a staggered  dosing (sentinel participant) approach will be used. 
The first participant in  both Parts  1A and 1B will receive Cycle  1 Day1  dose of study drug(s),  and 
be observed for 5 days, before additional participants (ie, Participant [ADDRESS_643410] in that cohort) 
receive study  drugs. The first participants  to be dosed in all subsequent dose level  cohorts will also 
be subject to a 5 -day sentinel period. 
Initially, 3 participants will be enrolled  at the start of each cohort, in accordance with the sentinel 
participant approach  cited  above. However,  to allow  for any unforeseen discontinuations (such  as 
disease  progression) before the 4-week  dose- limiting  toxicity  (DLT)  period is completed, an extra 
participant  may be enrolled in each dose escalation  cohort. Therefore,  there  will be a total of 
4 participants  (3 + 1) at the start of each cohort, provided that the fourth participant  is able to start 
the first day of dosing within approximately [ADDRESS_643411] participant in the same dose escalation cohort.

[IP_ADDRESS] Dose Escalation Decisions for Monotherapy and Combination (Parts  1A 
and 1B)  
The dose escalation phase of the study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of BMS -986207, 
given alone or  in combination with nivolumab, based on DLTs, using a BLRM  model (for  
BMS -986207 as monotherapy) and a BLRM -copula model (for BMS -986207 in combination with 
nivolumab).  
Combination dose escalation  (Part 1B)  will not begin until 3 dose cohorts (i.e., 20 mg, 80 mg  and 
240 mg) have been determined to be safe in monotherapy dose escalation (Part 1A) During the 
dose escalation phase, a set of  approximately [ADDRESS_643412] completed  a 4-week  DLT  period. Any toxicities 
that occur beyond the 4 -week DLT period will be accounted for in making dose level decisions 
and/or dose level modifications.  
If the potential DLT occurring in  the third evaluable participant regarding  the specific  dose level 
does not influence the dose recommendation by [CONTACT_499814] -Copula model,  the next dose 
level may proceed without waiting for the third participant to complete the corresponding DLT observation period, after discussion and agreement between the Sponsor and Investigators. Continuous re-assessment  of dose recommendation, by [CONTACT_499815] - 
Copula in the combination phase, will be carried out for each dose level. Planned dose levels for 
dose escalation are provided in Table [IP_ADDRESS]-1. Planned dose levels may be modified, or intermediate dose levels added, based upon the BLRM analysis.

days (4 weeks)  in Part 1A and 28 days (4 weeks) in  Part 1B. Any toxicities  that occur  beyond the 
4-week DLT period will be accounted for in making dose level decisions. 
For the purpose of participant management, any AE that meets DLT criteria, regardless of the 
cycle in which it occurs, will lead to discontinuation of study drug. Participants who withdraw from the study during the DLT evaluation period for reasons other than a DLT may be replaced with a new participant  at the same  dose level.  The incidence of DLT(s)  during the DLT  evaluation 
period will be used in dose escalation decisions and to define the MTD. AEs occurring after the 4-week DLT evaluation period will be considered for the purposes of defining the RP2D upon 
agreement  between  the Sponsor, Medical  Monitor, and Investigators, if the AEs are determined  to 
have no clear alternative cause and are not related to disease progression.  
Participants experiencing a DLT will not be retreated with study drug and will enter the safety follow -up period of the study. AEs will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE v4.03. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Safety Evaluation Phase of Part 1C  
Up to 18 participants  per dose level  tested  will be treated  in the Triplet Cohort. BMS -986207 will 
be administered  at 600 mg and/or 360 mg q3w and nivolumab will be administered  at 360 mg q3w. 
Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], at a dose of  1 mg/kg, will be given q6w. The DLT period in Part 1C will be 42 days 
(6 weeks).  
A dose of 1200 mg BMS -986207 administered  every  3 weeks has been  tested  per Amendment 03 
but due to the DLTs  observed no additional participants  will be tested  at this dose (see 
Section [IP_ADDRESS]).

 The DLT safety monitoring during the dose evaluation phase, including the potential decision to 
de-escalate to a lower dose, will be based on the BOIN design framework with target toxicity 
(DLT) rate of 30% (24%, 36%), as presented in Table [IP_ADDRESS]-1.23,[ADDRESS_643413] and 
transparent  than other model- based  and model- assisted  methods. The decisions on dose tolerability 
guided by [CONTACT_499816] a pair 
of fixed dose escalation and de -escalation boundaries. This allows generation of a decision table 
that guides DLT  assessment  depending on the number of participants  treated  and observed DLTs. 
The performance of  the design based on the operating characteristics is shown in Appendix 12. 
As a dose escalation is not planned in Part 1C, a design recommendation to declare a dose as 
tolerable  is based  on meeting  the same  criteria  needed to escalate.  A minimum  of 6 DLT  evaluable 
participants will be required in Part 1C to declare a dose tolerable for initiation of Part 2C. In 
addition, to better estimate tolerability of the dose level in combination with nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125],  more  participants  will be treated  even  if a dose is declared  tolerable  with n=6, for up 
to a total of [ADDRESS_643414], a design recommendation “Stay” indicates that this dose level 
needs to be evaluated further for safety to declare this dose tolerable. In that case, additional cohorts of 3-4 or more participants (depending on the number of  observed DLTs) will be treated 
up to a total of 18. If dose -de-escalation is recommended by [CONTACT_499817] ( Table  [IP_ADDRESS]-1),  then the next 
lower dose level  will be used (360 mg BMS -986207 q3w) for the remaining participants as well 
as for those currently  on treatment. In  addition, other lower doses of  BMS -986207 (200 mg q3w) 
than that seen as safe and tolerable may also be tested.  
Initially, the first 3 to 4 participants treated in the Triplet Cohort will be evaluated for DLTs. If 0 or 1 DLT  is observed during the 6- week  DLT  period, an additional 3-4 participants  will be treated 
at the same BMS -986207 dose level. If ≤[ADDRESS_643415] 6 DLT -evaluable 
participants, the dose will be considered safe. If 2 DLTs are observed out of 6 DLT -evaluable 
participants,  an additional 3-4 participants  will be enrolled. If ≤3 DLTs  are observed out of 9 DLT - 
evaluable participants,  an additional 3 participants  will be enrolled. If 2 DLTs  are observed out of 
12 DLT evaluable participants, the dose level will be considered safe.  
If 3
 or 4 DLTs  are observed out of 12 DLT  evaluable participants  as shown in Table  [IP_ADDRESS]-1, the 
design recommends to stay  at the same dose level, indicating that more participants may need to 
be evaluated  to determine  whether the dose level  is safe.  After considering additional information 
such as provided in Table [IP_ADDRESS]-2 and the totality of available data including safety, 
PK/pharmacodynamics from all treated participants, a lower dose may be considered for evaluation, (eg, if 4 /12 DLTs)  or the dose may be considered safe (eg, with 3/12 DLTs) based  on 
discussion between the Investigator and Sponsor/Medical Monitor, and based on posterior probability of the  DLT  rate exceeding  the target.  Once  a dose is declared  safe based  on at least 
6 participants, an additional 6- 12 participants may be treated up to a total of 18 to continue to 
confirm the safety of the selected dose. At the same time, enrollment in Part 2C may begin. In addition, another cohort up to 18 participants  may be treated  at the next lower  dose of BMS -986207 
to optimize  dose selection.  Participants  who do not complete  the DLT  observation period for

 [IP_ADDRESS] Cohort  Expansion (Parts  2A, 2B, and 2C) 
The purpose of cohort expansion is to gather additional safety, tolerability, preliminary efficacy, 
PK,  information regarding BMS -986207 alone and in combination with nivolumab. 
Continuous evaluation of toxicity events in the cohort expansions will be performed throughout 
enrollment in the expansion cohorts. If, at any time, the aggregate rate of treatment -related 
toxicities meeting DLT criteria exceeds 33% across all participants treated in cohort expansions 
2A or 2B,  the findings will be discussed  and further enrollment will  be interrupted. Depending on 
the nature and grade of the toxicity, and after assessing the risk/benefit ratio, a new dose for all cohorts may be initiated at a previously tested lower dose level or at a dose level intermediate to 
previously tested, lower dose levels.  
In Part 2A, only CRC will be evaluated in cohort expansion with BMS -986207 as monotherapy. 
In Part 2B, the 3 disease -restricted  populations, ovarian cancer,  colorectal cancer  (CRC)  and HCC 
will be investigated in cohort expansions with BMS -[ADDRESS_643417] disease progression on BMS -986207 monotherapy will be able to cross over to combination treatment (BMS -986207 + 
nivolumab), once the CRC expansion arms (ie, monotherapy and combination therapy) are both enrolling. This cross- over option, for CRC  participants  only, is not applicable during the escalation 
phases.  
The purpose of Part 2C is to gather preliminary efficacy information regarding BMS -986207 in 
combination with nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. Participants with advanced, treatment -naive 
NSCLC whose tumors express PD -L1 will be treated with BMS -986207 in combination with 
nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. BMS -986207 will be administered at 600 mg q3w (or tolerable dose 
as determined in Part 1C) and nivolumab will be administered at 360 mg q3w. Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], at a dose of 1 mg/kg, will be given q6w. 
Part 2C may begin once there is sufficient safety data from a minimum of 6 participants in Part 
1C. 
Part 2C will enroll a minimum of 20 participants  per dose level  of BMS -986207. One or two doses 
are planned to be evaluated and selected from the range of doses assessed as tolerable and not 
exceeding the maximum tolerated dose in Part 1C. If two doses will be tested at the Sponsor’s discretion,  participants  will be randomized in a 1:[ADDRESS_643418] been tested at the dose found safe in Part 1C. 
Continuous evaluation of toxicity  events will also be performed  in this part of the study. If, at any 
time,  the aggregate rate  of treatment -related  toxicities meeting  DLT  criteria  exceeds 33%  in Parts 
2A or 2B, the findings will be discussed  and further enrollment may be interrupted.  In addition, a 
more  guided continuous safety  monitoring will be implemented  in Part 2C, 1L NSCLC expansion, 
using a Bayesian framework and specific criteria based on a posterior probability of a DLT rate exceeding  33% implemented  starting  with n=6 ( Table  10.3.8-1).  D

participants, including those currently on treatment, may be initiated at a lower dose level. 
Participants with an outcome of unconfirmed progressive disease, stable disease (SD), partial 
response (PR), or complete response (CR), at the end of a given cycle, will continue to the next treatment cycle. Participants will be allowed  to continue study  treatment until the first occurrence 
of any of the following: 
• Completion of the maximum number of cycles 
• Confirmed  PD (see Section  5.1.4) 
• Clinical deterioration  suggesting that no further benefit from treatment is  likely  
• Intolerability  to therapy  
• Participant  meets criteria  for discontinuation of study treatment  as shown in Section  8.1 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Treatment  with Additional  Cycles Beyond 24 Weeks (Parts  1A, 1B, 2A, 
and 2B)  
All participants  will be treated  for up to 24 weeks (3 cycles)  with monotherapy (Parts  1A and 2A) 
or combination  therapy (Parts  1B and 2B), unless treatment discontinuation criteria  are met earlier 
(Section 8.1). Participants with ongoing disease control (CR, PR or SD) or unconfirmed 
p 
rogressive disease, after completing approximately the initial 24 weeks of treatment, may be 
eligible for an additional 3 cycles of study therapy in both the monotherapy (Parts 1A and 2A) 
and combination therapy  (Parts  1B and 2B). These participants  will be selected on a case by  [CONTACT_17878],  after careful  evaluation  and discussion with the BMS  Medical  Monitor, to determine  whether 
the risk/benefit ratio supports administration  of further study therapy. Upon completion  of 3 cycles 
of study therapy (or up to a maximum of 6 cycles if applicable),  all participants  will enter  the safety 
follow -up period. 
Individual p articipants  with confirmed  CR will be given the option to discontinue study  treatment, 
on a case by [CONTACT_413], after specific consultation and agreement between the Investigator and BMS Medical Monitor in settings where benefit/risk justify discontinuation of study therapy. 
5.1.3 Follow -up 
[IP_ADDRESS] Safety Follow -up Period  
For participants in Parts 1A, 1B, 2A and 2B, upon completion of  3 cycles of  study therapy (or up 
to a maximum of 6 cycles if applicable), and once the decision is made to discontinue the 
participant  from  treatment,  ie, at end of treatment  (EOT),  all participants  will enter  a safety  follow- 
up period. 
In Parts 1C and 2C, participants can receive study  treatments up to a maximum of [ADDRESS_643419] scheduled and completed on -treatment visit, and will be the start of the safety follow -

need to be repeated. Accordingly, for these participants, this visit will be considered the start of the safety follow -up period. 
After the EOT visit,  all participants will be evaluated for any new  AEs for at least [ADDRESS_643421] dose of therapy. Follow -up visits should occur at Day 30, 60 and 100 ( ± 7 days) after the 
last dose, or the date of  discontinuation ( ± 7 days). All participants will be required to complete 
the 3 clinical safety follow -up visits, regardless of whether new anti -cancer therapy is started, 
except those participants who withdraw consent for study participation. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Response Follow -up Period (Parts  1A, 1B, 1C, 2A, 2B, and 2C) 
Participants, with SD, PR, or CR, at the time of the EOT visit or at the time of study drug 
discontinuation, will continue to have radiologic and clinical tumor  assessments every [ADDRESS_643422] year after discontinuation of study drug/EOT visit. Subsequently, they will continue to receive  tumor assessment  scans as per standard  of care  guidelines, or at a minimum  of every 
[ADDRESS_643423] dose of study drug, or until disease progression/withdrawal of study consent. Radiological assessments for participants who have ongoing clinical benefit may continue to be collected after participants complete the survival follow -up period of the study. Participants who have disease progression following an initial 
course of study therapy will not be evaluated for response beyond the EOT visit, and will be allowed to receive other tumor directed therapy as required. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Survival  Follow -up Period  
In parallel  with the safety  follow -up period, participants in Parts  1A, 1B, 2A and 2B will start the 
survival follow -up period. Participants will be followed -up by [CONTACT_119570] 12 weeks (from 
EOT)  for [ADDRESS_643424]. Survival follow -up visits  will occur every  12 weeks (±7 days) until [ADDRESS_643425] dose of study  drug. Study assessments are to be collected as outlined in Table 2 -5. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Retreatment During Follow -up Periods (Parts  1A, 1B, 2A, and 2B) 
Retreatment  may be  allowed for  participants  with disease progression during the safety, response

Eligibility  will be dependent upon participants  having confirmed  disease progression within 
[ADDRESS_643426] dose of study drug, and will considered on a case by [CONTACT_413], after 
careful evaluation and discussion with the BMS Medical Monitor, to determine whether the risk/benefit ratio supports administration  of further study therapy. Participants  meeting  criteria  for 
retreatment  will have to  provide written  consent prior to  receiving any additional  retreatments,  by 
[CONTACT_499819], or other alternative  treatment  options. Participants  meeting  criteria  for, and consenting to, retreatment,  will 
be treated with the originally assigned monotherapy or combination therapy regimen (eg, same dose and dose schedule as administered  during the first 24 weeks),  unless that dose and its schedule 
were  subsequently found to exceed  the MTD.  In that case,  the participant  will be treated  at the next 
lower or alternate dose and schedule. Alternatively, if the MTD has been determined at the time point when the participant is being retreated, that participant can be retreated at the MTD.  
Participants entering retreatment will follow the same Time and Events schedule as outlined in Section  2. Samples  for PK will be collected  less frequently (only at predose of each treatment

A described in Section 5.4.6, accumulating evidence indicates a minority of participants treated 
with immunotherapy may derive clinical benefit despi[INVESTIGATOR_102369]. 
Participants  will be permitted  to continue on study drug for treatment beyond initial RECIST  v1.1- 
defined progressive disease as long as they meet the following criteria:  
• Investigator- assessed  clinical  benefit and no rapid  disease progression  
• Participant  is tolerating  study treatment 
• Stable  performance  status 
• Treatment  
 beyond progression will not delay  an imminent intervention to prevent serious  
• complications of disease  progression (eg, CNS  metastases)  
• Participant provides written informed consent prior to receiving additional BMS -986207, 
nivolumab, and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_45777], using an ICF describing any reasonably foreseeable 
risks or discomforts, or other alternative treatment options.  
The decision to continue treatment beyond initial Investigator -assessed progression should be 
discussed  with the BMS  Medical  Monitor and documented in the study records. A follow -up scan 
should be performed within 4 to 6 weeks of original progressive disease to determine whether 
there  has been  a decrease in  the tumor size or continued progression of  disease.  Subsequent scans 
should be performed every 12 weeks until further progression is determined. If the Investigator

participant  should remain  on the trial and continue to receive  monitoring  according to the Schedule 
of Activities  in Section  2. For participants who continue study  therapy beyond progression, further 
progression is defined as an additional 10% increase in tumor burden from time of initial progressive disease.  This includes  an increase in the sum of  diameters of all target lesions and/or 
the diameters of new measurable lesions compared to the time of initial progressive disease. Nivolumab, ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], and BMS -[ADDRESS_643428] 10 mm (except  for pathological lymph nodes which  must have  a short axis of at least

measurable  and therefore  included in the tumor burden if the longest diameter increases to at least 
10 mm  (except for pathological  lymph  nodes, which  must  have  a short axis of at least 15 mm).  In 
situations where the relative increase in total tumor burden by 10% is solely due to inclusion of new lesions which become measurable,  these new lesions must  demonstrate an absolute increase 
of at least 5 mm.  
5.1.5 Data Monitoring Committee and Other External Committees  
BMS has developed a multi -layered process to ensure safety monitoring through close 
collaboration of study site Investigators, the BMS study team, and the BMS Worldwide Patient Safety  (WWPS) -led Safety  Management Team  (SMT). This collaborative process constitutes the 
safety -monitoring plan for the study. To support safety oversight, BMS has established ongoing 
processes for collection,  review,  analysis,  and submission  of individual adverse event  reports and 
their aggregate analyses.  Because this  is an open- label  study, WWPS,  the BMS  Medical  Monitor, 
and the Investigators will have access to all data necessary for safety evaluation.  
BMS WWPS is an internal group that operates independently from the clinical team to monitor safety  across  all BMS  protocols and analyze  all accumulated  safety  data.  Within  BMS,  an SMT is 
established for investigational therapi[INVESTIGATOR_499739], and a member of WWPS chairs this team. In addition, safety signal detection is performed at least monthly and ad hoc throughout the study by [CONTACT_499820], at a minimum,  of the WPS medical  safety  assessment 
physician (Chair of the SMT) and WWPS single -case review physician, the study Medical 
Monitor, the study biostatistician, and epi[INVESTIGATOR_47561], all of whom evaluate the safety data regularly. Furthermore, the SMT routinely monitors for actual or potential issues related to 
participant  safety  that could  result in  a change in the medical  benefit- risk balance associated  with 
the use of study treatment(s). For Part 2C, continuous safety monitoring based on a Bayesian 
framework is also planned in the NSCLC cohort for ongoing evaluation of  the tolerability of the 
selected dose.  
5.2 N
 umber  of Participants 
The approximate number of evaluable participants will be approximately 241. Approximately  100 
of these participants will be treated with monotherapy and combination therapy dose escalation (35 participants  each for Part 1A and Part 1B and additional 30 participants  for the substudy of

5.4 Scientific Rationale for Study Design  
BMS -986207 is  being investigated  in humans with advanced  solid  tumors; either  as monotherapy 
and in combination with nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. The study design for Parts 1A, 1B, 2A, and 
2B includes the following: 
• 28-day screening period 
• 24-week (3 cycles)  treatment period, with the  option of an additional  24 weeks (3 cycles) of 
treatment (granted on a case by [CONTACT_413])  
− Dose  escalation  phase  
− Cohort expansion phase  
• Safety  follow -up period  
• Response/Survival follow -up period, with the possibility  for retreatment  
The study design for Parts  1C and 2C, aligned with concurrent use of nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], 
includes the following:  
• 28-day screening  period 
• Treatment  period  – up to a maximum of 2 years  in the absence of disease  progression or 
unacceptable toxicity 
• Safety  follow -up period  (30, 60, and 100 days ( ± 7 days) after last dose or date of 
discontinuation)  
• Survival follow-up period  – [ADDRESS_643430]

 5.4.1 Rationale for BMS- 986207 Monotherapy in Colorectal  Cancer  Cancer  
and Other Cancers Associated with Fusobacterium Nucleatum  
In CRC, bacteria such as Fusobacterium nucleatum ( F. nucleatum ) are abundant in the tumor 
microenvironment. The amount of F. nucleatum DNA in CRC tissue is associated with shorter 
survival, and may potentially  serve  as a prognostic  F. nucleatum is thought to facilitate 
a tumor’s  ability  to evade immune  cell attack  through inhibition of the function of T lymphocytes  
and NK cells.25 Tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes usually express TIGIT,  thus T cell activities can 
be inhibited by F. nucleatum via Fap2, a protein unique to F. nucleatum . Given localization of 
Fap2  in the colon, it is anticipated  that BMS -986207 monotherapy will be therapeutically  effective 
for CRC. F. nucleatum may play a role in mediating tumor immune escape through interaction 
with TIGIT in other indications, such as SCCHN, in which the bacterium may be isolated from 
saliva samples.26 In these  other tumors,  similarly  to CRC,  F. nucleatum activates  lymphocyte

T cells (combination immunotherapy) may result in better outcomes as compared to engagement

Two distinct nonconventional patterns have been reported: 1) a  reduction in target tumor burden

initial phase, followed by [CONTACT_20361].

 These phenomena were observed in the Phase 2 study (CA209003) of nivolumab in solid tumor 
patients. Two hypotheses potentially explain these phenomena. First, enhanced inflammation within tumors could lead to an increase in tumor size, which would appear as enlarged index lesions and as newly visible small non -index lesions. Over time, both the malignant and 
inflammatory portions of the mass may then decrease, leading to overt signs of clinical improvement. Alternatively, in some individuals, the kinetics of tumor growth may initially outpace anti -tumor immune activity. With sufficient time, the anti -tumor activity will dominate 
and become clinically apparent. Therefore, it is important to avoid premature discontinuation of the study drug that might induce a nonconventional response pattern in some patients. 
The decision  to continue treatment  beyond investigator -assessed  progression should be discussed 
with the BMS Medical Monitor and documented in the study records. The assessment of clinical 
benefit should take into account whether the participant is clinically deteriorating and unlikely to 
receive further benefit from continued treatment.  
5.4.7 Rationale for Tumor  Selection  
TIGIT is expressed by [CONTACT_93247] T cells, Tregs, and NK cells, and binds the adhesion molecules 
PVR (CD155) and Nectin -2 (CD112) with higher and lower affinity, respectively.
13 PVR and 
Nectin -2 also bind to TIGIT’s co -stimulatory counterpart, DNAM -1 (CD226). DNAM -1 is an 
activating receptor expressed on NK cells, CD8+ T cells, and other immune cells.  40 Upon 
recognizing its ligands PVR and Nectin- 2, DNAM -1 promotes NK cell –mediated elimination of 
damaged cells.  
One can hypothesize that the tumors most likely to respond to anti -TIGIT therapy  are those with 
the highest PVR/Nectin -2 expression, and those with moderate -to-high immune cell infiltration. 
Accordingly, the selected tumor types of HCC, CRC, ovarian cancer, and NSCLC and their 
respective rationale for selection, are given in Table 5.4.7-1.

5.4.8 Rationale for Dose Escalation Phase Design  
The BLRM  with an overdose control principle  escalation  was selected  as an appropriate  design for 
this study. It offers  more  accuracy and efficiency  in determining  the true  MTD compared to 
rule-based methods (such  as 3 + 3 design) by [CONTACT_499825]. The Escalation with Overdose Control (EWOC) 
principle limits the risk of exposing participants in the next cohort to an unsafe or toxic dose. Hence, it ensures that safety is not compromised during dose escalation. Simulation results 
demonstrate that BLRM allows fast escalation when the expected toxicity is very low and with 
participants  treated  at sub- therapeutic  doses,  which  is attributed  to the adaptive Bayesian  learning 
from previous doses. In addition, BLRM has greater applicability to the combination therapy setting  compared  to other  model- based  methods. After completing  the monotherapy phases (Parts 
1A and 1B), the drug- associated  dose- toxicity  profiles  are characterized  and incorporated as prior 
knowledge into the drug combination phase of the study (Parts 2A and 2B) or used in future studies.  
For Part 1C where  a single select  dose level  of BMS -986207 will be evaluated  with potential for a 
lower dose (de -escalation), a simpler mode -assisted design framework will be used, the BOIN 
design, to evaluate tolerability based on incidence of DLTs.
23,24 Additional lower doses may be 
tested for dose optimization at the Sponsor’s discretion.  
5.5 Justification for Planned Dose  Selection  
5.5.1 The current  study is a FIH study.  
There  is no previous clinical  experience with BMS -986207.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Introduction  
The FIH starting  dose of BMS -986207 as an immune- mediated  anti-cancer  agent was  determined

 participant  safety  while  limiting  the number of participants  receiving nonpharmacologically active 
doses. The toxicology -based approach utilized the HNSTD determined from a 1 -month repeat - 
dose toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys. The pharmacology- based approach leveraged the 
pharmacology data (ie,  anti- tumor efficacy)  obtained from  mouse surrogates to project the human 
effective  dose, from which  the FIH starting  dose was selected.  The starting  doses determined  from 
both approaches were  integrated,  and the lower  dose (1 mg/kg or 80 mg assuming  an average  body 
weight of 80 kg in cancer patients) derived from the pharmacology data is recommended as the 
FIH starting dose for BMS -986207. 
To further ensure a sufficient safety margin for the monotherapy  starting dose, given the absence 
of previous clinical experience with  BMS -986207, a Preliminary Safety Cohort (PSC) was added 
to the study.  In the PSC, a single participant will receive BMS -986207 monotherapy starting at 
the 2 mg dose,  with intra-participant dose escalation to  6 mg, and then to 20 mg. Following a 
5-day safety observation period for this participant following the initial administration of the 20 
mg dose, two additional participants will begin the study at the 20 mg BMS -986207 dose level. 
See Appendix 13 for complete detail on the Preliminary Safety Cohort.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Nonclinical  Pharmacokinetics and Efficacy  
Human starting dose selection is based on preclinical pharmacological activity. The anti -tumor 
efficacy  of an anti -mouse TIGIT  antibody surrogate  (10A7- mIgG1  D265A,  abbreviated  as 10A7) 
was studied in a mouse CT26 colon adenocarcinoma model as a single agent and in combination 
with an anti-mouse PD-1 antibody (4H2 -mIgG1  D265A, abbreviated as 4H2).  In the study, 10A7 
did not have single agent activities. When combined with 4H2, 10A7 exhibited dose -dependent 
anti-tumor efficacies, and with the dose increased from 0 to 0.3, 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg, the median 
tumor growth inhibition (TGI) increased  from  respectively. 
Consistently, the number of tumor- free mice in each dose group   also 
increased  in a dose-dependent manner. The effective dose of 10A7  in combination with 4H2 in the 
mouse CT26  model is considered  to be  to achieve  close to maximal  efficacy  (    TGI).  
At the effective dose level,  the Cave.14d and Cmin.14d of 10A7  are estimated  to be 
μM, respectively. Because 10A7 and BMS -986207 exhibited similar binding affinities on the 
respective activated  mouse  and human CD8+  T cells 
respectively),  the  human effective  dose of BMS -[ADDRESS_643440] the human effective dose, the human clearance  was allometrically  scaled 
from the cynomolgus monkey data with a power exponent of   , and the human volume of 
distribution (  was assumed  to be equal  to that in cynomolgus monkeys (Please  refer to 
Table [IP_ADDRESS]-1). Additionally, the following assumptions were made: 1) 2- compartment PK 
model; 2) dose -proportional PK; and 3) minimal impact of ADAs on PK. By  [CONTACT_499826].14d and Cmin.14d in mice,  the 
human effective  dose of BMS -986218, administered  q2w, was projected  to be 4 mg/kg (or 320 mg 
for a body weight of 80 kg).  At the equivalent  exposure of the clinical  starting  dose, the projected 
anti-tumor efficacy of its mouse surrogate 10A7 in combination with 4H2 is approximately 
TGI in the CT26 tumor model.

TIGIT  expression by [CONTACT_499827], such as T cells and NK cells. No unexpected tissue

of directly  BMS -986207- related  adverse findings, the no-observed- adverse- effect  level  (NOAEL)  
 
Overall, the nonclinical toxicology assessment of BMS -986207 has demonstrated an acceptable 
safety profile, supporting clinical use in oncology patients. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Rationale for Starting  Dose in Humans  
The selection  of the BMS -986207 starting  dose is based  on the nonclinical CT26  mouse syngeneic 
tumor model (TGM1607), for combined  BMS -986207 and nivolumab, and the pi[INVESTIGATOR_78078] -dose 
IV toxicology study in monkeys. 
In the pi[INVESTIGATOR_78078] -dose (5 doses/week) IV toxicity  study, the dose of 
) was established  as the HNSTD and NOAEL  dose.  Using  a safety  factor of 6, 
the maximum recommended starting  dose (MRSD)  of  was derived. This toxicity -based 
dose of  was considered an inappropriate starting dose given that dose level’s 
relationship to the projected human effective dose.  
Therefore,  the projected human effective dose derived from  CT26 mouse tumor model  was used 
to determine  the selection  of the FIH starting  dose.  At the dose of 1 mg/kg for BMS -986207 
(IV q2w), its TGI was projected as approximately   Additionally, the dose of 1 mg/kg was 
projected  with AUC (0-336h) ,ss of which has an approximate fold safety 
margin relative to the AUC[0 -168h],ss of HNSTD and NOAEL dose 
from the weekly, repeat -dose monkey study, after normalization  of the dosing interval.  
Based on the projected  TG I and the corresponding - fold safety margin, 1 mg/kg was 
selected as the FIH starting dose for BMS -986207 monotherapy, administered q2w. The 
recommended starting  human  dose of 1 mg/kg was converted to a flat dose  of [ADDRESS_643442]  body weight assumption  of 80 kg. 
5.5.2 Rationale for Dosing Schedule  
[IP_ADDRESS] BMS- 986207 
In this study, the BMS -986207 dosing schedule of q2w was based on the projected human half - 
life, derived from a monkey single dose study . The PK profiles of BMS -986207 in 
monkeys following a single  IV dose of 1, 10, and 100 mg/kg  were  used to project the human PK

 parameters. The projected half- life in humans is  , which  approximates 14 days (q2w),  the 
selected dosing schedule. 
The human effective  dose of BMS -986207 administered  in combination with nivolumab in cancer 
patients,  was projected  to target steady -state average plasma  concentration  (Cave)  and minimum 
plasma concentration (Cmin) of  , respectively, equivalent to 10A7- mIgG1 
D265A Cave_14d and Cmin_14d at  the efficacious dose in CT26 mouse  tumor model. Based on 
the projected  human PK of BMS -986207, the human effective  is projected  to be 4 mg/kg IV 
administered once every 2 weeks (q2w). A flat dose of BMS -986207 (mg) will be used in this 
study, given similar exposure variability  of flat-dose as compared  to body weight- based  dosing for 
many therapeutic antibodies and practical advantages.  41 
The current protocol evaluates the q2w dosing regimen. A dosing regimen of q4w is being 
considered for the single -agent of  BMS -986207, as well as with in combination with nivolumab. 
The q4w option will benefit the patients with less frequent visits and reduce the medical burden 
from the care givers and the cancer treatment institutions.  The projected human PK profile of 
BMS -986207 is linear, and the dose for q4w dosing schedule will be based on q2w with linear 
extrapolation. The exposure, efficacy and safety, of BMS -986207 as a single agent and in 
combination with nivolumab, will be evaluated and compared with the q2w dosing schedule. Based on the totality of clinical data, the sponsor will consider to revise the dosing regimen, if appropriate.  
BMS -986207 PK was evaluated  in participants  with advanced solid  tumors  receiving  q2w (20, 80, 
240, 800, or 1600 mg) and q4w (480 or 1600 mg) doses in Part 1A, 1B and 2A of CA020002. 
Preliminary  PK results  of BMS  [ADDRESS_643443] the increase in exposure is proportional across the 
dose range evaluated, which is in agreement with preclinical predictions. The CLT appears 
consistent across doses. For participants who received combination treatment with nivolumab in Part 1B, the PK of BMS -986207 appears to be consistent with that reported for monotherapy in 
Part 1A and 2A.
19 
In the Triplet Cohort (Part 1C), the initial proposed BMS -[ADDRESS_643444]-2021, revealed that 2 out of 4 DLT -evaluable participants  experienced  DLTs  with the 
combination of  BMS -[PHONE_10376] mg Q3W, nivolumab 360 mg Q3W, and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 1 mg/kg 
Q6W  (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS] for more  details).  BMS -986207 dose of 1200 mg Q3W was  reduced to 
600 mg per BOIN design. BMS -986207 dose of 600 mg Q3W is expected to provide half of the 
exposure as compared to 1200 mg Q3W, and a relatively high intratumoral TIGIT receptor 
occupancy at the   level. In addition, BMS -986207 dose of 360 mg Q3W may be explored 
to aid in RP2D dose selection and per BOIN design if de- escalation is needed.  
The selection  of an every -3-weeks regimen  allows  for aligning the schedule of BMS -986207 with 
combination of nivolumab q3w and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]  q6w in 1L NSCLC (See Section  [IP_ADDRESS] and

NSCLC.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Nivolumab  
Nivolumab monotherapy has been extensively studied in multiple tumor types, including 
melanoma, NSCLC, RCC, cHL, SCCHN, and urothelial carcinoma, and has been safely administered at doses up to 10 mg/kg q2w. Nivolumab is currently approved for the treatment of various tumor types with monotherapy regimen of 480 mg q4w, 240 mg q2w, or 3 mg/kg q2w. When used in combination with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_499747], nivolumab 360 mg q3w is approved for the treatment of 1L NSCLC.  
Based  on the clinical  experience and quantitative clinical  pharmacology understanding, nivolumab 
480 mg q4w, 360 mg q3w, or 240 mg q2w infused over approximately 30 minutes were selected 
in this study as these doses are expected to provide similar nivolumab exposures (Cavg and Ctrough), and to allow  the flexibility  of aligning doses of nivolumab at the same dosing frequency 
of BMS -986207 for the combination treatment. 
Specifically,  in the Triplet  Cohort (Part 1C) and Triplet NSCLC Expansion (Part  2C), participants

[IP_ADDRESS] Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_499748] 3 mg/kg  q3w for 4 doses and 10 mg/kg q3w for 4 doses followed  by [CONTACT_499829], respectively.  Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_499749],  including melanoma,  RCC,  CRC, and  HCC with a dosing regimen  of 1 mg/kg 
q3w or 3 mg/kg q3w for 4 doses, depending on tumor type.

In addition, a less frequent  but continuous ipi[INVESTIGATOR_499750]  (1 mg/kg q6w) is  being  evaluated 
in combination with nivolumab or nivolumab plus chemotherapy in a number of  pi[INVESTIGATOR_36491], 
including 1L NSCLC studies CA209227 and CA2099LA, 1L SCCHN study CA209651, and 1L 
mesothelioma study CA209743. For instance, study CA2099LA, evaluating nivolumab 360 mg 
q3w plus ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 1 mg/kg q6w given concomitantly with 2 cycles of chemotherapy, demonstrated superior survival benefit to patients with 1L NSCLC as compared to SOC chemotherapy. The safety profile of  this triple combination regimen was reflective of the known 
safety profiles of the immunotherapy and chemotherapy. Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 1 mg/kg q6w is currently approved for the treatment of 1L NSCLC, in combination  with nivolumab or with nivolumab and  
2 cycles of chemotherapy, and is also approved for the treatment of 1L mesothelioma, in 
combination with nivolumab.

Based  on the clinical experience, low -dose ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 1 mg/kg q6w infused over approximately 
30 minutes will be examined in combination with nivolumab and BMS -986207 in the Triplet 
Cohort (Part 1C) and Triplet NSCLC Expansion (Part 2C) of this study.

 [IP_ADDRESS] Rationale for Infusion Times  
Long infusion times (greater than or equal to 60 minutes), especially when multiple agents are 
administered sequentially to an individual, place a burden on participants and treatment centers. Establishing that investigational agents, such as BMS -986207, can be safely administered using 
an infusion time of [ADDRESS_643445] (not an agonist) and has 
a low  likelihood  of resulting in infusion reactions. For participants <  [ADDRESS_643446] 30 minutes after completion of the infusion of nivolumab. 
Nivolumab has been administered safely over 60 minutes at doses ranging up to 10 mg/kg over 
long treatment  duration. In Study  CA209010 (a Phase 2, randomized, double- blinded, 
dose- ranging  study of nivolumab in  participants  with advanced/metastatic clear  cell RCC),  a dose 
association  was observed  for infusion site reactions and hypersensitivity reactions (1.7%  at 
0.3 mg/kg, 3.7% at 2 mg/kg, and 18.5% at 10 mg/kg). All  the events were Grade 1 to 2 and were 
manageable.  An infusion duration of 30 minutes  for 3 mg/kg nivolumab (30%  of the dose provided 
at 10 mg/kg) is not expected to present any safety concerns compared to the prior experience at 10 mg/kg nivolumab dose infused over a 60 minute duration. 
Similarly, ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125],  which  will be given in Part 1C and Part 2C, was safely administered  over 
90 minutes  at 10 mg/kg. In the CA184022 study, where ipi[INVESTIGATOR_499751] a dose 
of 10 mg/kg, on-study drug related hypersensitivity events (Grade 1 -2) were reported in 1 (1.4%) 
participant in  the 0.3 mg/kg  group and in 2 (2.8%)  participants  in the 10 mg/kg group.  There  were 
no drug- related hypersensitivity events reported in the 3 mg/kg group. Across the 3 treatment 
groups, no Grade  3-4 drug- related  hypersensitivity events were  reported and there  were  no reports 
of infusion reactions. Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 10 mg/kg monotherapy has also been safely administered as a 90 minute infusion  in large  phase 3 studies in prostate  cancer  (CA184043) and as adjuvant therapy 
for stage 3 melanoma (CA184029), with infusion reactions occurring in participants. Administering 1 mg/kg of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_45752] -tenth of the 10 mg/kg dose and will be 
administered over one- third the time, for a lower infusion rate.  
Of note, CA209153, a Phase 3b/[ADDRESS_643447] been  uncommon 
with nivolumab or ipi[INVESTIGATOR_499752]. 
Overall, a change in safety profile is not anticipated with a 30 -minute infusion of nivolumab or 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], infusion times that are consistent with the current USPIs for each drug.

7. TREATMENT  
7.1 Treatments Administered  
Study treatment is defined as any investigational treatment(s), marketed product(s), placebo or 
medical device intended to be administered to a study participant according to the study randomization or treatment allocation. 
An IP, also known as investigational medicinal product in some regions, is defined as a 
pharmaceutical form of an active substance or placebo being tested or used as a reference in a clinical study, including products already with a marketing authorization but used or assembled (formulated or packaged) differently than the authorized form, or used for an unauthorized indication, or when used to gain further information about the authorized form. 
Other  medications used as support or escape medication  for preventative, diagnostic, or therapeutic 
reasons, as components of the standard of care for a given diagnosis, may be considered as 
noninvestigational products. 
All drugs used in this open- label study qualify as IPs, as per previous text, and their description 
and storage information are described in Table 7.1-1.

period, followed by a 60- minute infusion of BMS -986207. 
For participants  < 38 kg on the 1200 mg dose, the infusion time will be 90 minutes.  For participants 
with a bodyweight of > 250 kg the dosing of BMS -986207 will occur the day after dosing of 
nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_499755]. Details of study 
drug preparation are found in the Pharmacy Manual. 
 
7.2 Method of Treatment Assignment  
In this open- label  study, enrolled participants,  including those not dosed, will be assigned  via IRT 
sequential participant  numbers starting  with  (eg, ). Those 
enrolled participants meeting the inclusion criteria, and none of the exclusion criteria, will be 
eligible to be dosed. Sequential numbering may  restart at   for each participating site as  the 
distinct participant identification number will ultimately comprise of the site number and participant  number, (eg,  ). In the expansion phase only, participants with CRC  will be 
randomized in a 1:1 manner to either BMS -986207 monotherapy, or combination therapy with 
BMS -986207 and nivolumab, to eliminate the possibility of enrollment bias. 
Participants  in Pa
 rt 2C with 1L NSCLC and tumor cell PD-L1 expression of > 1% based  on 
pre-existing lab results will be enrolled to receive combination therapy with BMS -986207, 
nivolumab, and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. If more than 25% of the participants have a PD -L1 score < 1% as 
determined by [CONTACT_6626], additional  participants may be enrolled in order to have at least 30 
participants with a tumor cell score of ≥ 1%.  
Participants  w ill not be replaced  if they are discontinued from  the study secondary  to an AE unless 
the AE can be determined to be unrelated to treatment. If a participant is replaced after dosing, 
then the replacement participant  will be assigned the original  participant’s number plus   The 
replacement  participant  will receive the same  treatment as the participant being replaced  but a new 
participant number will be assigned to him or her. For example, Participant

1C and 2C, see Section [IP_ADDRESS] and Section [IP_ADDRESS], respectively. 
7.4.1 Dose Limiting Toxicities  
For the purpose of guiding dose escalation,  DLTs  will be defined based  on the incidence,  intensity, 
and duration of AEs  for which  no clear alternative cause  is identified. The DLT period will be 
28 days (4 weeks) in Parts 1A and 1B. The DLT period for Part 1C will be 42 days (6 weeks). 
For the purpose of participant management, any AE that meets DLT criteria, regardless of the 
cycle in which it occurs, will lead to discontinuation of study drug unless the Investigator determines that only [ADDRESS_643471] be discontinued due to toxicity attributed to that agent 
alone. Participants who withdraw from the study during the 4- week DLT evaluation period (6- 
week DLT evaluation period for Parts 1C and 2C) for reasons other than a DLT may be replaced with a new participant at the same dose level. The incidence of DLTs during the 4 -week DLT 
evaluation period (6- week DLT evaluation period for Parts 1C and 2C) will be used in dose 
escalation  decisions and to  define the MTD.  AEs  occurring after the 4- week  DLT  period  (6-week 
DLT evaluation period for Parts 1C and 2C) will be considered for the purposes of defining the RP2D upon agreement between the Sponsor, Medical Monitor, and Investigators. 
Participants experiencing a DLT will not be retreated with study drug, and will enter the safety 
follow -up period of the study. DLTs  occurring after the 4- week  (or 6- week  period for Parts  1C and 
2C) DLT observation period will be accounted for in determining the RP2D for expansion. 
AEs will be graded according  to the NCI CTCAE  v4.03.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Hepatic Dose- Limiting  Toxicity  
Any one of the following study drug- related  events will be considered a hepatic DLT (except for 
HCC participants):  
• Grade 4 elevations in serum  transaminases (AST, ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) or  total 
bilirubin  
• Grade 3 elevations in serum transaminases (AST, ALT) or alkaline phosphatase (ALP) that 
last longer  than 5 days, or is associated with  clinical  symptoms, or  bilirubin >  [ADDRESS_643472] in the 
absence of cholestasis  
• Grade [ADDRESS_643473] or ALT with symptomatic liver inflammation (eg, right upper 
quadrant tenderness, jaundice, pruritus)  
• AST or ALT > [ADDRESS_643474] and concurrent total bilirubin > [ADDRESS_643475] without initial findings of 
cholestasis (elevated  ALP,  eg, findings consistent  with Hy’s  law or FDA definition  of potential 
drug- induced liver injury [pDILI]). Note that this specific category of DLT uses ULN rather 
than CTCAE grade for definition.

received study medication dose. 
The end of cycle tumor assessments, such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance 
imaging  (MRI),  or positron emission  tomography (PET),  will continue on a q8w schedule relative 
to the participant’s first dose, regardless of any treatment delay incurred.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Criteria  for Dose Delay Secondary to Changes in AST or ALT for 
Participants with HCC  
Participants with  HCC who  experience the following  must have  the study  drug delayed:  
1) If a participant has  a baseline  AST  or ALT  that is  within  normal  limits,  delay  dosing for  drug- 
related ≥  Grade 2 toxicity (2 grade shift) 
2) If a participant has baseline AST  or ALT within the Grade 1 toxicity  range, delay  dosing for 
drug- related ≥  Grade 3 toxicity (2 grade shift) 
3) If  a participant has baseline AST  or ALT  within  the Grade  [ADDRESS_643480]  or ALT values 8 × ULN (whichever 
is lower)  
4) H epatic DLT  as defined in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]  
 
 
It is recommended to monitor elevations in AST or ALT approximately every 3 days until levels 
peak  and begin to decline.  BMS -986207 dosing can be resumed  where  criteria  to resume treatment 
are met ( Section [IP_ADDRESS]) 
[IP_ADDRESS] Protocol -Specific Recommendation for Management  of Hepatic Events 
in HCC Participants  
The algorithms  recommended for the management  of immune -related  AEs in this  protocol are in 
Appendix 6. Protocol -specific recommendation for the management of hepatic events in HCC 
participants are as follows:  
• Dose  delay  criteria  for hepatic events are outlined in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]. If AST  or ALT  levels do 
not improve with a dose delay  of 3 to 5 days, or if the levels  worsen, steroid  therapy should be 
initiated at 0.5 to 2 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone or oral equivalent 
• For ALT  or AST  levels  > [ADDRESS_643481],  steroid  therapy should be initiated  promptly  at 
1 to 2 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone IV, intramuscularly, or oral equivalent 
• For all participants receiving steroid treatment for hepatic events, the BMS Medical Monitor 
should be consulted within 24 hours after initiation of steroids. Gastroenterology consult is 
recommended 
• If AST or ALT levels do not improve within 3 to 5 days after the start of steroid therapy, or 
the levels worsen  after the start of steroid therapy, discussion with the BMS  Medical  Monitor 
regarding the possibility of adding mycophenolate mofetil 1 g twice daily should occur

 • Tapering of steroids can start once AST or ALT levels have declined by 1 CTCAE grade. 
Steroids should be tapered slowly, over no less than 1 month 
 
As outlined in Section [IP_ADDRESS], study therapy may resume when AST or ALT have returned to 
Grade  1 or baseline unless  the AE meets  the criteria  for permanent discontinuation ( Section  7.4.4). 
The BMS Medical Monitor must be consulted prior to resuming nivolumab for all participants who required steroid intervention. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Criteria to Resume Treatment  
Subsequent dosing with study therapy may resume once drug- related nonDLT AEs resolve to 
Grade 1 or baseline.  
Participants experiencing AEs not meeting criteria for permanent discontinuation as outlined in 
Section 7.4.4 may resume treatment with study medication under the following criteria:  
• Participants may resume treatment with study drug when the drug- related AE(s) resolve to 
Grade ≤  1 or baseline value, with the following exceptions: 
− Participants  may resume treatment in the presence  of Grade  2 fatigue  
− Participants who have not experienced a Grade 3 drug- related skin AE may resume 
treatment in the presence of Grade 2 skin toxicity  
− Participants  with Grade  2 uveitis, epi[INVESTIGATOR_227],  iritis, eye  pain or blurred  vision not meeting 
DLT criteria (Section 8.2 ) must resolve to baseline prior to resuming study therapy  
• For participants with Grade [ADDRESS_643482], ALT, or total bilirubin elevations, dosing may resume 
when  laboratory  values return  to baseline,  and management  with corticosteroids  (if needed), is 
complete  
• Participants  with combined Grade  [ADDRESS_643483]/ALT  and total bilirubin values meeting  DLT  criteria 
(Section [IP_ADDRESS]) should have treatment permanently discontinued 
• Participants with  confirmed  SARS -CoV-2 infection may resume  treatment after 1) at least 10 
days (20 days for severe/critical illness) have passed since symptoms first appeared,  positive 
RT-PCR test result, or positive viral antigen test result; 2) resolution of acute symptoms 
(including at least [ADDRESS_643484] fever  without fever  reducing medications); 3) 
evaluation by [CONTACT_104128] a higher risk of receiving investigational treatment; and 4) consultation by [CONTACT_1689]. For suspected cases, treatment may also resume if SARS -CoV- 2 
infection is ruled -out and other criteria to resume treatment are met.  
• Prior to re -initiating on -study treatment in a participant with a dosing delay lasting 8 weeks 
due to SARS- CoV-2 infection, the Medical Monitor/designee must be consulted.

 For Grade 1 symptoms (mild reaction; infusion interruption not indicated; intervention not 
indicated):  
• Remain at bedside and monitor participant until recovery from symptoms. The following 
prophylactic premedications are recommended for future infusions: diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen/paracetamol [ADDRESS_643491] 30 minutes before study drug administrations. 
 
For Grade 2 symptoms (moderate reaction requiring therapy or infusion interruption but 
responding
 promptly  to symptomatic  treatment  such as antihistamines,  nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs, narcotics, corticosteroids, bronchodilators, IV fluids, or prophylactic 
medications indicated for ≤ 24 hours): 
• Stop the study drug infusion, begin an IV infusion of normal saline, and treat the participant 
with diphenhydramine 50 mg IV (or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen/paracetamol 
325 to 1000 mg; remain at bedside and monitor participant until resolution of symptoms. 
Corticosteroid and/or bronchodilator therapy may also be administered as appropriate. If the infusion is interrupted, then restart the infusion at 50% of the original infusion rate when symptoms resolve; if no further complications ensue after 30 minutes, the rate may be increased  to 100%  of the original infusion  rate. Monitor participant closely.  If symptoms  recur, 
then no further BMS- 986207 or nivolumab will be administered at that visit.  
• For future infusions, the following prophylactic premedications are recommended: 
diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen/paracetamol [ADDRESS_643492] 30 minutes before study drug infusions. If necessary, 
corticosteroids (up to 25 mg of hydrocortisone or equivalent) may be used. 
 
For Grade 3 or 4 symptoms (severe reaction, Grade 3: prolonged [ie, not rapi[INVESTIGATOR_143799]/or brief  interruption  of infusion]; recurrence  of symptoms following 
initial improvement; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14138] [eg, renal impairment, pulmonary infiltrates]; Grade 4: Life -threatening; pressor or ventilatory support indicated):  
• Immediately discontinue infusion of study drug. Begin an IV infusion of normal saline and 
treat the participant as follows: recommend bronchodilators, epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] 0.2 to 1 mg of a 1:1000 solution for subcutaneous administration or 0.1 to 0.25 mg of a 1:10,000 solution injected slowly for IV administration, and/or diphenhydramine 50 mg IV with methylprednisolone 100 mg IV (or equivalent), as needed. Participant should be monitored until the Investigator is comfortable that the symptoms will not recur. Study drug will be permanently  discontinued except  for a Grade  3 infusion  reaction  that returns to Grade  1 in less 
than 6 hours. Investigators should follow their institutional guidelines for the treatment of anaphylaxis. Remain at bedside and monitor participant until recovery of the symptoms. 
 
In case of late -occurring hypersensitivity symptoms (eg, appearance of a localized  or generalized 
pruritus within 1 week after treatment), symptomatic treatment may be given (eg, oral 
antihistamine or corticosteroids).

of the following reasons:  
• Documented disease progression as defined by [CONTACT_393]  v1.1 ( Appendix 5) unless participants 
meet criteria for treatment beyond progression (Section 5.1.4 ) 
• Clinical deterioration while receiving active study therapy that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_684],  indicates that continued participation  in the study is not in the best interest of the 
participant  
• Protocol-defined reasons  for permanent  discontinuation ( Section  7.4.4) 
• Any drug- related  AE occurring  at any time that meets  DLT  criteria  as outlined in Section  7.4.[ADDRESS_643496] be discontinued due to toxicity attributed to that agent alone. Exceptions to 
permanent discontinuation are listed in Section 7.4.4.

the discontinuation must be documented in the participant’s medical records and entered on the 
appropriate CRF page.  
8.1.1 Discontinuation Due to Further Progression (Confirmed Progression)  
A radiographic assessment  should be performed  at each scheduled  tumor assessment,  4 to 6 weeks 
following initial disease progression, to determine whether there has been continued progressive disease  or not. Participants  should discontinue study therapy upon evidence of further progression, 
defined as an additional 10% or greater increase in tumor burden volume from time of initial progression (including all target lesions and new measurable lesions). 
The tumor burden volume from time of initial progression  should be used as the reference  baseline 
for comparison with the postprogression assessment. 
Any new lesion considered nonmeasurable at the time of initial progression may become 
measurable and, therefore, must be included in the tumor burden measurement according to the 
following:  
• For solid  tumors : New lesions are considered measurable at the time of initial progression if 
the longest diameter  is at least  10 mm (except  for pathological lymph nodes, which  must have 
a short axis of at least 15 mm).  
 
For statistical analyses that include the Investigator- assessed progression date, participants who 
continue treatment beyond initial  Investigator -assessed,  RECIST  v1.1-defined progression will be 
considered to have Investigator -assessed progressive disease at the time of the initial progression 
event.  
8.1.[ADDRESS_643498] (preferred) or MRI described in Section 9.4.5, is required when participants continue post -progression treatment. For participants  that discontinue

• Study procedures and timing are summarized in the Schedule of Activities. Protocol waivers 
or exemptions are not allowed. Adherence to the study design requirements, including those 
specified in the Schedule of Activities, is essential and required for study conduct. 
• Study governance considerations in terms  of compliance and reporting of AEs are available  in 
Appendices 2 and 3. 
• All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential participants meet all eligibility criteria before enrollment. The Investigator will maintain a screening log to record details of all participants screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for screening failure, as applicable.  
• Procedures conducted as part of the participant’s  routine  clinical management  (eg, blood count) 
and obtained before signing of informed consent may be utilized for screening or baseline purposes provided the procedure meets the protocol -defined criteria and has been performed 
within the timeframe defined in the Schedule of Activities.  
• All immediate  safety  concerns must be discussed with BMS immediately  upon occurrence or 
awareness to determine if the participant should continue or discontinue treatment  
 
9.[ADDRESS_643502] and/or MRI,  as appropriate. In Parts  1A, 1B, 2A, and 
2B, assessments will be performed at baseline, q8w (± 1 week) during the treatment period, and 
q12w for the first year after discontinuation of study drug/EOT visit. Subsequently, they will continue to receive tumor  assessment  scans as per standard of care guidelines, or at a minimum of 
every [ADDRESS_643503] dose of study drug, or until disease progression/withdrawal of study consent. In Parts 1C and 2C, contrast -enhanced CT of the chest, 
CT/MRI  of the abdomen, pelvis, and all other  known and/or suspected  sites of disease should occur 
every [ADDRESS_643504] dose (±  7 days) for the first 12 months (week 48), then 
every  12 weeks (± 7 days)  until the end of year 2, then every  12 weeks  (± 14 days) thereafter  until 
disease progression or treatment discontinuation, whichever occurs later. The same imaging modality must be used for all assessments, per RECIST v1.1 ( Appendix 5). Tumor assessment 
should be performed prior to initiating next cycle of treatment. Unconfirmed PR/CR must be confirmed at least [ADDRESS_643505] of care.  However,  data for these assessments should remain  in the participant’s  medical 
record  and should not be provided to the Sponsor  or Designee,  unless specifically  requested  from 
BMS or designee.

 AEs will be reported by [CONTACT_2299] (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or the 
participant's legally authorized representative).  
The Investigator and any designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and reporting events that meet  the definition of an AE or SAE and remain  responsible for following  up AEs that 
are serious, considered  related  to the study treatment  or the study, or that caused  the participant  to 
discontinue before completing the study. 
Contacts for SAE  reporting are specified  in Appendix [ADDRESS_643506],  at the time points specified  in the Schedule of Activities  (Section  2). Nonserious 
AE information should also be collected from the start of an observational period intended to 
establish a baseline status for the participants.  
Sections 5.6.1 and 5.6.2 in the BMS -986207 IB represent the Reference Safety Information to 
determine expectedness of SAEs for expedited reporting.
19 Following the participant’s written 
consent to  participate  in the study, all  SAEs,  whether related  or not related  to study drug, must be 
collected, including those thought to be associated with protocol -specified procedures. 
All SAEs must be collected that occur during the screening period and within [ADDRESS_643507] report any SAE that occurs after these time periods and that is believed to be related to study drug or protocol -specified procedure.  Please 
note the following adverse event reporting requirements:  
• Medical  occurrences that begin before  the start of study treatment  but after obtaining informed 
consent will be recorded on the appropriate section of the eCRF section. 
• All SAEs  will be recorded  and reported to the Sponsor or Designee within  24 hours.  
• The Investigator will submit any updated SAE  data to the Sponsor within  24 hours of this being 
available.  
 
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs in former study participants. 
However, if the Investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a participant 
has been  discharged  from the study, and he/she considers the event reasonably  related  to the study 
treatment or study participation, the Investigator must promptly notify the Sponsor. 
The method of evaluating, and assessing causality of AEs and SAEs and the procedures for 
completing and reporting/transmitting SAE reports are provided in Appendix 3. 
9.2.2 M
 ethod of Detecting AEs and SAEs  
Adverse events can be spontaneously reported or elicited during open- ended questioning, 
examination, or evaluation of  a participant.  In order to prevent reporting  bias, participants  should 
not be questioned regarding the specific occurrence of AEs.

 9.2.3 Follow -up of AEs and SAEs  
• Nonserious AEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization,  or reported  as SAEs  if they 
become serious (Section 9.2). 
• Follow- up is also required for nonserious AEs that cause interruption or discontinuation of 
study treatment and for those present at the end of study treatment as appropriate. 
• All identified nonserious AEs must be recorded and described on the nonserious AE page of 
the CRF (paper or electronic). Completion of supplemental CRFs may be requested for AEs and/or laboratory abnormalities that are reported/identified during the course of the study. 
• All SAEs  and AEs (including  non-serious AEs)  associated  with confirmed  or suspected  SARS - 
CoV- [ADDRESS_643508] to follow -up (as 
defined in Section 9.2.3 ) or for suspected cases, until SARS -CoV-2 infection is ruled- out. 
 
After the initial AE/SAE report, the Investigator is required to proactively follow -up each 
participant at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs, and nonserious AEs of special interest (as 
defined in Section  9.2) will be followed -up until resolution,  until the condition stabilizes,  until the 
event is otherwise  explained, or until the participant is lost to follow -up (as defined in Section  8.3).  
9.2.4 Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs  
• Prompt notification by [CONTACT_143940] a 
product under clinical investigation are met.  
• An Investigator who receives an Investigator safety report describing SAEs or other specific 
safety information (eg, summary  or listing of SAEs) from the Sponsor will file it along with 
the IB and will notify the Institutional Review Board/ Independent Ethics Committee, if 
appropriate according to local requirements.  
 
The Sponsor or Designee will be reporting AEs to regulatory authorities and ethics committees 
according to local applicable laws including European Directive 2001/20/EC and FDA Code of Federal Regulations 21 CFR Parts 312 and 320. A S[LOCATION_003]R (Suspected, Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction)  is a subset  of SAEs  that will be reported to the appropriate regulatory  authorities 
and Investigators following local and global guidelines and requirements. 
9.2.[ADDRESS_643509] immediately  notify  the BMS  Medical

by [CONTACT_72943] (eg, anemia versus low hemoglobin value). 
9.2.7 Potential  Drug -induced Liver  Injury (p-DILI) 
Wherever possible, timely confirmation of initial liver- related laboratory abnormalities should 
occur prior to the reporting of a p- DILI event. All occurrences of p -DILIs meeting the defined 
criteria, must be reported as SAEs (see Section 9.2 for reporting details).  
Potential drug induced liver injury  is defined as: 
• ALT  or AST  elevation  > [ADDRESS_643512]  
AND  
• Total bilirubin > [ADDRESS_643513], without initial findings of cholestasis (elevated serum alkaline 
phosphatase), 
AND  
• No other immediately apparent possible causes of aminotransaminases elevation and 
hyperbilirubinemia, including, but not limited  to, viral hepatitis, pre -existing chronic or acute 
liver disease, or the administration of other drug(s) known to be hepatotoxic. 
 
Specifically  for HCC: p- DILI  is defined as: 
• Concurrent ALT ≥ 10 × ULN AND total bilirubin ≥  2 × ULN or baseline value (if elevated 
bilirubin at study entry), AND 
• No other immediately apparent possible causes of ALT elevation and hyperbilirubinemia, 
including, but not limited  to, tumor progression, acute viral hepatitis,  cholestasis,  pre-existing 
hepatic disease or the administration of other drug(s), herbal medications and substances 
known to be hepatotoxic.

The key responsibilities for investigators during p- DILI assessment include: (i) Early detection, 
medical evaluation (including the exclusion of other potential causes) and rapid laboratory 
confirmation of liver- related abnormalities, and (ii) BMS notification of p -DILI cases via SAE 
forms. Following the gathering and assessment of relevant clinical information, BMS is responsible for: (iii) Timely evaluation and triaging of p -DILI cases, (iv) Expedited reporting of 
p-DILI cases and (v) Expanded review of p- DILI cases including a detailed assessment of all 
available clinical information, investigations and biochemical data.  
Investigators are  expected  to monitor ongoing routine  and ad  hoc hepatic laboratory  test results  to 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_120012] a participant meets p -DILI criteria. They are expected to promptly 
notify BMS of all p -DILI cases. p -DILI cases may be identified by [CONTACT_499842],  whether or not they are accompanied  by [CONTACT_79939]- related  signs and/or symptoms. In both cases, 
expedited confirmation  with  repeat  laboratory  testing  should occur within  3 business days using a 
Hepatic Laboratory Panel (ALT, AST, total bilirubin, ALP). Any participant with an abnormal Hepatic Laboratory  Panel  that meets  p-DILI  criteria  is a candidate for study  drug discontinuation. 
Any confirmed p -DILI  events must be reported (along with  a description of the clinical findings) 
to BMS as an SAE within 24 hours of confirmation. 
An extensive clinical history, examination and appropriate investigations should be obtained to exclude cholestatic and other apparent  causes that may explain the observed abnormalities  in liver 
function and/or hepatic signs and symptoms.  Other  apparent causes include, nonexhaustively and 
by [CONTACT_120070]: infectious diseases (such as active hepatitis A, B and C), congenital diseases (such as Gilbert’s syndrome), neoplastic diseases (such as HCC), autoimmune diseases (such as primary biliary cirrhosis) and the use of concomitant hepatotoxic medications (such as antibiotics,  the oral contraceptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_499758]).  All investigations to exclude potential 
causes of liver function abnormalities or hepatic signs and/or symptoms should be guided by [CONTACT_499843]’s age, gender, clinical history, and signs and symptoms.  
9.2.8 Other Safety Considerations  
Any significant worsening noted during interim or final physical examinations, including electrocardiogram (ECG), X -ray filming, any other potential safety assessment required or not 
required by [CONTACT_990], should also be recorded as a nonserious or serious AE, as appropriate, and reported accordingly.

Central  assessments are not planned for this study, however copi[INVESTIGATOR_499759], if  determined  to be necessary by [CONTACT_20444]. At  the Sponsor’s  discretion, 
scans may be collected centrally to be reviewed by [CONTACT_499847]. 
Computer  Tomography/Magnetic Resonance Imaging  
Contrast- enhanced CT scans acquired on dedicated CT equipment is preferred for this study. CT 
with contrast of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis are to be performed for tumor assessments. CT scans should be acquired with 5 mm slices with no intervening gap (contiguous). 
Should a participant have  a contraindication  for CT IV contrast,  a noncontrast CT of the chest  and 
a contrast enhanced MRI of  the abdomen and pelvis may be obtained. MRIs should be acquired 
with slice thickness of < 5 mm with no gap (contiguous). 
Every  attempt  should be made to image  each participant using an identical  acquisition  protocol on 
the same scanner for all imaging timepoints.  
Use of CT component of a PET/CT scanner: 
Combined modality scanning such as with fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) -PET/CT is increasingly 
used in clinical care, and is a modality/technology that is in rapid evolution; therefore, the 
recommendations outlined here may change rather quickly with time. At present, low dose or attenuation  correction  CT portions of a combined FDG- PET/CT are of limited  use in anatomically 
based efficacy assessments and it is therefore suggested that they should not be substituted for dedicated diagnostic  contrast enhanced CT scans for  anatomically based  RECIST  measurements. 
However, if a site can document that the CT performed as part of a FDG -PET/CT is of identical 
diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral  contrast) then the CT portion of the FDG- 
PET/CT can be used for RECIST  1.[ADDRESS_643521] CNS involvement.

9.5 Pharmacokinetics and Immunogenicity  
The PK of BMS -986207 will be derived from serum concentration versus time data when 
appropriate. The PK parameters that will be assessed, following the intensive PK collection, are 
shown in Table 9.5-1.

AUC(0 -T) Area  under  the serum  concentration -time curve  from  time zero to time of last quantifiable 
concentration  
AUC(TAU)  Area  under  the concentration -time curve  in one dosing  interval  
Parameters  that may potentially  be assessed following  the dose administration  in Cycle  2 Day 1 
Ctau Observed  concentration  at the end of a dosing  interval  
CLT Total body clearance 
Css-avg Average  concentration  over a dosing interval  (AUC[TAU]/tau) 
AI_TAU  Ratio  of an exposure  measure at steady  state to that after the first dose (exposure  measure 
includes AUC[TAU])  
T-HALFeff  Effective  elimination  half-life that explains  the degree  of accumulation  observed  for a 
specific exposure measure (exposure measure includes AUC[TAU])  
Parameter  to be reported  separately  
 
 
Individual participant PK parameter values will be derived by [CONTACT_499848] a validated PK analysis program. Actual times will be used for the analyses.

assessment  of PK and immunogenicity. Further  details of blood collection and processing  will be 
provided to the site in the Laboratory Manual. 
All predose samples should preferably be taken within 30 minutes before the start of any dose 
infusion. In Part 1C and 2C, as shown in Table  9.5-4 end-of-infusion (EOI) PK samples for BMS -

predose sample is collected but the dose is subsequently delayed, an additional predose sample should be collected.  ‘Event Kit - Dose  Delay’  should be used in the event  that a predose PK sample 
was obtained and the participant is not dosed on that same day. Following consensus of the Investigator and the BMS Medical Monitor, an additional  PK and/or ADA sample may be taken 
following  a SAE  or important medical  event  using  an ‘Event  Kit - AE’. Further  details  of sample

(EWOC) principle will be used. The method is fully adaptive, makes use of all the information available at the time of each dose assignment, not just data from  the current  dose level,  and directly 
addresses the ethical need to control the probability of overdosing. The targeted toxicity rate in this study is in the range  of [16%, 33%).  The boundary is similar  to the toxicity  boundary used by 
a rule -based design (ie, 3 + 3 design) in that a minimum is set at 16% (~ 1 in 6) DLT rate and a 
maximum at 33% (~ 2 in 6) DLT  rate. The use of the EWOC principle  limits  the risk of exposing 
patients in  the next  cohort to an unsafe dose by [CONTACT_499849] 33% at any dose is capped at 30%.  
The maximum  number of participants treated  will be 35 for each dose escalation  part 
(BMS -986207 monotherapy [Part 1A], BMS -986207 in combination with nivolumab [Part 1B]). 
However,  simulation  studies with various scenarios show  that the expected  number of 
DLT -evaluable participants is no more than approximately 20. ( Appendix 12).  
Approximately 3 participants  will be treated  at the starting  dose levels  of BMS -986207 or 
BMS -986207 in combination with nivolumab. While the BLRM/BLRM -copula will use DLT 
information from the DLT period only, clinical assessment will take into consideration of the 
totality  of available data including PK/  from  all treated  participants  encompassing  monotherapy 
and combination therapy, in assigning a dose level for the next cohort of [ADDRESS_643531]

Date:[ADDRESS_643532] 12 DLT -evaluable participants 
will be treated  at each dose level.  Additional participants (up to a total of 15) may be treated at  or 
any dose level below the estimated MTD for further evaluation of safety, PK,  parameters as 
required.  
The model-recommended MTD  is the dose that satisfies  the following three  conditions:  
1) The empi[INVESTIGATOR_499762] “DLT  rate of 16% - <33%”  is greater  than a 
pre-specified value (i.e., 50%);  
2) Th is  probability  needs to be the largest  amongst the dose levels that satisfy  the EWOC 
condition (i.e., the probability that the “DLT rate > 33%” must be less than 30%);  
3) Minimum number of participants  (i.e., 6) were  treated  at this dose level.  
 
The final recommended MTD/RP2D will be based on the recommendation from the 
BLRM/BLRM -copula and overall clinical  assessment  of all available safety,  PK,  and efficacy 
data. Lower  doses of BMS -986207 may be tested  if none of the planned doses are found to be 
tolerable as monotherapy or in combination with nivolumab. Such decisions will be made after 
discussion and agreement between the Investigators and the BMS Medical Monitor. 
10.1.2 Safety Evaluation Phase (Part 1C)  
The safety of triplet therapy will be evaluated across the tumor types in up to approximately 18 
treated participants per dose level who receive triplet therapy based on the number of DLTs observed. Assuming a DLT target of 30% (24%, 36%) the BOIN design framework will be used to guide decisions in this setting, including potential de- escalation  to a lower  dose of BMS -986207 
in combination with both nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], if warranted by [CONTACT_499850] (see Table  [IP_ADDRESS]-1).  In addition, calculations  related  to the risk of a BMS -986207 dose level  selected 
as tolerable are shown expressed as a posterior probability of toxicity in Section [IP_ADDRESS] (Table  
[IP_ADDRESS]-2 ). 
10.1.3 Cohort Expansion  
The purpose of cohort expansion is to gather additional safety, tolerability, preliminary efficacy, 
PK,  information regarding BMS -986207 alone or in combination with nivolumab. 
However,  the sample size is strictly based on efficacy, specifically  on the target ORR relative to 
historic response rate.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Cohort Expansion in Part 2A and Part 2B  
Part 2A will be an expansion phase  of the BMS -986207 monotherapy in  participants  with CRC at 
1 dose level.  Part 2B will be an expansion phase for BMS -986207 in combination  with nivolumab 
in participants  with CRC,  HCC,  and ovarian  cancer.  Each  disease cohort expansion will be handled 
independently and there will be no multiplicity adjustment.  
The Fleming 2 -stage design  framework will  be used as a guide  for the expansion cohorts  in 
Parts  2A and 2B.
42,43 The total sample  size for each expansion cohort will be calculated  to provide 
a reasonable false -positive rate (FPR)  <10%  and false-negative rate (FNR)  < 10% based  on

 assumptions of true (target) and historic  ORR for each indication. The assumed  historic  and target 
response rates may  change over time and may need to be adjusted by  [CONTACT_499851].  The sample size and operational characteristics of using a 
2-stage design, as an example, are provided in Table [IP_ADDRESS]- 1, although this is not used for 
statistical hypothesis testing. Using a 2- stage design provides an option to stop early for futility, 
as well as a signal of preliminary   activity  for strong-go, early  on. Enrollment may 
continue into Stage  2, while  the planned number of participants for Stage  1 are followed for 
efficacy evaluable tumor assessments. There will be no stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_31081] a disease cohort for efficacy, 
although an early plan for the next stage of clinical development may be initiated. Sample sizes may need to be increased in order to explore differential responses between  expressed 
and nonexpressed groups. 
Guided by [CONTACT_50489] [IP_ADDRESS]-1, approximately  11 CRC participants  will be treated  with BMS -986207 
monotherapy in Stage 1. Assuming the  true response rate is 20% in this population when treated 
with BMS -986207 monotherapy, if there  are 2 or more  responses in 11 participants,  it may trigger 
an expansion of the clinical development plan after careful evaluation of all available data 
including duration of response and safety profile. The probability to observe such a favorable response is approximately 68%  if in fact the treatment is efficacious.  If there  is no response  in 
11 treated  participants,  the cohort may be stopped for futility.  The probability of early  stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_499763] 80% if in fact the treatment is inefficacious,  eg, 2%. If there  is [ADDRESS_643533]  more  data.  At the end of Stage  2, if there  is 
1 or no response, further clinical development may not be warranted. If there are 2 or more 
responses, it may show evidence of treatment efficacy.

 [IP_ADDRESS] Cohort Expansion in Part 2C  
Part 2C will be an expansion phase of the BMS -986207 in combination with nivolumab and 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_499764] -naive NSCLC whose  tumor cells express  
≥ 1% PD-L1. 
The sample size for Part 2C is based  on assessing  an initial  activity  signal as estimated 
by [CONTACT_499852] 1L NSCLC population. 
One or two doses are planned to be evaluated in Part 2C and a minimum of 20 participants are 
enrolled per dose level  of BMS -986207. So approximately 40 evaluable participants in total  with 
1L NSCLC with tumor cell PD -L1 expression of ≥ 1% will be treated with BMS -[ADDRESS_643534], additional 
participants (up to 20%) will be enrolled to achieve a sample size of 40 evaluable participants.  
The following Bayesian posterior probability (PP) criteria will be used to assess signal of anti - 
tumor activity with benchmark of 36% as unfavorable ORR and 56% as desirable ORR:44,45 
• An activity  signal is based  on ORR satisfying  the dual criteria: PP (ORR ≥ 0.56 ) 
≥ 40% and PP (ORR  ≥ 0.36) ≥ 80% 
• A lack of activity  signal  is based  on ORR meeting  the criterion: PP (ORR ≥  0.36) < 20% 
A beta prior distribution beta (1, 1) for ORR and Binomial Bin (n, ORR)  likelihood for number of 
responders were used.  
Based  on the above criteria, for each dose level  a total of 20 evaluable participants  in Part 2C will 
provide approximately 6.5% chance to show   activity  when a true ORR is  36%, and at 
least 63% chance of showing activity signal if the true ORR is 56% or more (see Table [IP_ADDRESS]-  
1) 
The ORR thresholds for efficacy  signal  (responders ≥ 11/20) and lack of efficacy  (≤ 6/20) and the 
operating characteristics of the posterior probability criteria are shown in Table [IP_ADDRESS]-1.

 2C to further evaluate the safety  of the triplet combination in the NSCLC population, in addition 
to that in Part 1C, as described below.  
A Bayesian framework  will be utilized for continuous monitoring of  toxicity in Part 2C based on 
AEs meeting  DLT  criteria.46 Observed  incidence  rates of treatment- related  toxicities  meeting  DLT 
criteria (defined in Section  7.4.1) will be evaluated relative to a boundary (number of DLTs) 
associated with higher chance of the true DLT rate exceeding 33%. 
Bayesian safety monitoring boundaries are established using a non- informative prior, Beta (0.5, 
0.5). The posterior distribution is Beta (0.5+ n, 0.5+( m-n)), where m is number  of treated Part  2C 
participants  and n is  the subset  of these  m participants  who experience treatment- related  toxicities 
meeting DLT criteria. All treated Part 2C participants are considered evaluable. The criterion for 
excess toxicity is based on a posterior probability (PP) of treated Part 2C participants with toxicities meeting DLT criteria > 33% | cumulative data exceeding 80%. If the criterion is met during continuous monitoring in Part 2C, there is greater  than 80% PP that the DLT rate exceeds 
33%; based on the observed data, the dose level may be re- evaluated and, based  on the totality  of 
data, a lower dose may be administered to the remaining participants. The cutoff number of participants with DLT needed to meet the criterion depends on the number of evaluable 
participants, with a final boundary of 14 participants with a DLT out of 37 or more.

 APPENDIX  2 STUDY GOVERANCE CONSIDERATIONS  
The term ‘Participant’ is  used in the protocol to refer  to a person who has consented  to participate 
in the clinical research  study. The term ‘Subject’  used in the eCRF  is intended to refer to a person 
(Participant) who has consented to participate in the clinical research study.  
REGULATORY AND ETHICAL  CONSIDERATIONS 
GOOD CLINICAL PRACTICE  
This study will be conducted in accordance with: 
• Consensus ethical  principles derived from international guidelines, including the Declaration 
of Helsinki and Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) 
International Guidelines Good Clinical Practice (GCP)  
• As defined by [CONTACT_102462] (ICH)  
• In accordance with the ethical  principles  underlying European Union Directive  2001/20/EC  
• United  States  Code of Federal  Regulations, Title  21, Part 50 (21CFR50)  
• Applicable local  requirements.  
 
The study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol. The protocol  and any amendments 
and the participant informed consent will receive approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_104050]/Independent Ethics  Committee  (IRB/IEC),  and regulatory authorities according to 
applicable local regulations prior to initiation of the study.  
All potential serious breaches must be reported to Sponsor or designee immediately. A serious breach  is a breach  of the conditions and principles of GCP  (occurring  in any country) in connection 
with the study or the protocol, which is likely to affect, to a significant degree, the safety or physical or mental integrity  of [ADDRESS_643555] or fraud (e.g., loss of medical licensure, debarment).  
INSTITUTIONAL  REVIEW  BOARD/INDEPENDENT  ETHICS COMMITTEE  
Before study initiation, the investigator must have written and dated approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_5698]/IEC for the protocol, consent form, participant recruitment materials (e.g., advertisements),  and any other written  information  to be  provided to  subjects.  The investigator or 
BMS  should also provide the IRB/IEC  with a copy of the Investigator Brochure or product labeling 
information to be provided to subjects and any updates. 
The investigator,  Sponsor or designee should provide the IRB/IEC  with reports,  updates and other 
information (e.g., expedited safety reports, amendments, and administrative letters) according to 
regulatory requirements or institution procedures.

Approved  v 71.0 930104927  7.0  
 COMPLIANCE WITH  THE PROTOCOL  AND PROTOCOL  REVISIONS  
The investigator should not implement any deviation or change to the protocol without prior 
review and documented approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_102403]/IEC (and if applicable, also by [CONTACT_14306]) except where necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to study subjects.  
If a deviation  or change to  a protocol is implemented  to eliminate  an immediate  hazard(s)  prior to 
obtaining relevant  approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649](s) the deviation or change will be submitted, as 
soon as possible to: 
• IRB/IEC  for 
• Regulatory Authority(ies),  if applicable  by [CONTACT_56819] (per national requirements)  
 
Documentation of approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_102404](s)/IEC(s) and if applicable, also by [CONTACT_102463].  
If an amendment substantially alters the study design or increases the potential risk to the 
participant: (1) the consent form must be revised and submitted to the IRB(s)/IEC(s) for review 
and approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]; (2) the revised  form  must be used to obtain consent from  subjects 
currently enrolled in the study if they are affected by [CONTACT_29991]; and (3) the new form must be used to obtain consent from new subjects prior to enrollment.  
If the revision is  done via an administrative  letter,  investigators  must inform their IRB(s)/IEC(s).  
FINANCIAL  DISCLOSURE  
Investigators and sub- Investigators will provide the Sponsor with sufficient, accurate financial 
information in accordance with local regulations to allow the Sponsor to submit complete and accurate financial certification or disclosure statements to the appropriate health authorities. Investigators are responsible for providing information  on financial interests  during the course of 
the study and for [ADDRESS_643556] ensure that subjects are clearly  and fully  informed  about the purpose, potential 
risks, and other critical issues regarding clinical studies in which they volunteer to participate.  
In situations  where  consent cannot be given to subjects,  their legally  acceptable representatives (as 
per country guidelines) are clearly  and fully  informed  about the purpose, potential risks,  and other 
critical issues regarding clinical studies in which the participant volunteers to participate.  
Sponsor or designee will provide the investigator with an appropriate (i.e., Global or Local)  sample 
informed consent form which will include all elements required by [CONTACT_12212], GCP and applicable regulatory requirements. The sample informed consent form  will adhere to the ethical principles 
that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.  
Clinical  Protocol 
BMS -986207  CA020002  
Anti-TIGIT  mAb  
Protocol  Amendment  No: 04 
Date:[ADDRESS_643557]: 
• Provide a copy of the consent form and written  information  about the study in the language in 
which  the participant is most proficient  prior to clinical  study participation.  The language must 
be non-technical and easily understood. 
• Allow time necessary for participant or participant's legally acceptable representative to 
inquire about the details of the study.  
• Obtain  an informed  consent signed and personally dated  by [CONTACT_104168]'s 
legally acceptable representative and by [CONTACT_52223].  
• Obtain  the IRB/IEC’s  written  approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_499771], prior to the beginning of  the study, 
and after any revisions are completed for new information.  
 
If informed consent is initially given by a participant’s legally acceptable representative or legal 
guardian, and  the participant subsequently becomes capable  of making  and communicating his  or 
her informed  consent during the study, consent must  additionally be obtained from the participant.  
Revise the informed consent whenever important new information becomes available that is relevant to the participant's consent. The investigator, or a person designated by [CONTACT_093], 
should fully inform the participant or the participant's legally acceptable representative or legal guardian, of all pertinent aspects of the study and of any new information relevant to the participant's willingness to continue participation in the study. This communication should be documented.  
The confidentiality  of records that could  identify  subjects must  be protected, respecting  the privacy 
and confidentiality  rules  applicable to regulatory  requirements,  the subjects'  signed ICF and, in the 
US, the subjects’ signed HIPAA Authorization.  
The consent form must also include a statement that BMS and regulatory authorities have direct 
access to participant records.  
The rights, safety, and well-being of the study subjects are the most important considerations  and 
should prevail over interests of science and society.  
SOURCE DOCUMENTS  
The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that the source data are accurate, legible, 
contemporaneous, original and attributable,  whether the data are hand- written  on paper  or entered 
electronically.  If source data are  created  (first entered),  modified, maintained, archived, retrieved,

 APPENDIX 3  ADVERSE EVENTS AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS: 
DEFINITIONS AND PROCEDURES FOR RECORDING, 
EVALUATING, FOLLOW UP AND REPORTING  
ADVERSE EVENTS  
Adverse Event  Definition:  
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a 
preexisting  medical  condition in a clinical  investigation participant administered  study treatment 
and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (such as an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally  associated with the use of  study  drug, whether or not 
considered related to the study treatment.  
Events Meeting  t he AE Definition  
• Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) or 
results from other safety assessments (eg, ECG, radiological scans, vital signs measurements),  including those that worsen  from  baseline,  considered  clinically  significant 
in the medical and scientific judgment of  the investigator.  Note that abnormal lab tests or 
other safety assessments should only be reported as AEs if the final diagnosis is not available. Once the final diagnosis is known, the reported term  should be updated to be the 
diagnosis.  
• Exacerbation  of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing  condition including either an increase 
in frequency and/or intensity of the condition. 
• New conditions detected or diagnosed after study intervention administration even though 
it may have been present before the start of the study. 
• Signs, symptoms,  or the clinical  sequelae of a suspected  drug-drug interaction.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study 
intervention or a concomitant medication.  Overdose,  as a verbatim  term (as reported by [CONTACT_1275]),  should not be reported  as an AE/SAE unless it is an intentional overdose taken 
with possible suicidal/self -harming intent. Such  overdoses should be reported regardless  of 
sequelae and should specify "intentional overdose" as the verbatim term. 
Events NOT Meet
 ing the AE  Definition  
• Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that leads to 
the procedure is the AE. 
• Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]).Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]). 
 
DEFINITION OF SAE 
If an event is not  an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE  even if serious conditions 
are met.

 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any 
dose:  
Results in death  
Is life -threatening (defined as an event in which the participant was at risk of  death at the time 
of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it 
were more severe)  
Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_104057]  (see NOTE 
below)  
NOTE:  
• The following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_104058]:  
• a visit to the emergency room or other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20347] < 24 hours, that does not result 
in admission (unless considered an important medical or life -threatening event)  
• elective  surgery, planned prior to signing consent  
• admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical procedure  
• routine health assessment requiring admission for baseline/trending of health status (eg, routine colonoscopy) 
• medical/surgical admission other than to remedy ill health and planned prior to entry into the study. Appropriate documentation is required in these cases 
• admission  encountered for  another life circumstance  that carries no bearing  on health  status 
and requires no medical/surgical intervention (e.g., lack of  housing, economic inadequacy, 
caregiver respi[INVESTIGATOR_040], family circumstances, administrative reason)  
• admission  for administration  of anticancer  therapy in the absence of any other  SAEs  (applies 
to oncology protocols)  
Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
 
Is a congenital anomaly/birth  defect  
Is an important  medical  event (defined  as a medical  event(s) that may not be immediately life - 
threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], based upon appropriate medical and 
scientific judgment, may jeopardize the participant or may require intervention [e.g., medical, surgical] to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed  in the definition  above.) Examples 
of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].) Potential drug induced liver injury (DILI) is also considered an important medical event. (See Section 9.2.7 for the definition of potential DILI.)

Approved  v 71.0 930104927  7.0  
 • SAEs, whether related or not  related  to study  drug, and pregnancies must be reported 
to BMS (or designee) immediately within 24 hours of awareness of the event.  
• SAEs  must be recorded  on the SAE  Report Form.  Pregnancy and potential drug induced liver injury  (DILI) must follow  the same transmission  timing 
and processes to BMS as used for SAEs (see Section 9.2.5 for reporting pregnancies). 
EVALUATING  AES AND SAES 
 
Assessment  of Causality  
• The Investigator  is obligated  to assess  the relationship  between  study  intervention  and 
each occurrence of each AE/SAE.  
• A “reasonable possibility” of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, 
and/or arguments to suggest a causal  relationship, rather than a relationship cannot be 
ruled out. 
• The Investigator will use clinical  judgment to determine  the relationship.  
• Alternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other risk 
factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study intervention 
administration will be considered and investigated. 
• The investigator will also consult the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) and/or Product 
Information, for marketed products, in his/her assessment.  
• For each AE/SAE,  the investigator must  document in the medical  notes that he/she has 
reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality.  
• There  may be situations  in which  an SAE  has occurred  and the investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to Sponsor. However, it is very important 
that the investigator always  make an assessment  of causality  for every  event  before the 
initial transmission of the SAE data to Sponsor.  
• The Investigator may change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_9242] -up 
information and send a SAE follow- up report with the updated causality assessment.  
• The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory 
reporting requirements. 
Follow -up of AEs and SAEs  
If only limited information is initially available, follow -up reports are required. (Note: 
Follow- up SAE reports must include the same investigator term(s) initially reported.) 
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity or relationship to study drug or if new 
information becomes available, the SAE  report must be updated and submitted within 24 
hours to BMS  (or designee)  using the same procedure used for transmitting  the initial SAE 
report.  
All SAEs  must  be followed  to resolution or stabilization.

Section 6.1 are acceptable for this study.  
DEFINITIONS  
Woman of Childbearing  Potential (WOCBP)  
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming postmenopausal unless 
permanently sterile. Permanent sterilization methods include hysterectomy, bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656], and bilateral oophorectomy. 
Women in the following  categories  are not considered  WOCBP:  
• Premenarchal  
• Premenopausal  female with  1 of the following:  
− Documented hysterectomy  
− Documented bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656]  
− Documented bilateral oophorectomy  
 
Note: Documentation can come from the site personnel’s review of the participant’s medical 
records, medical examination, or medical history interview.  
• Postmenopausal female  
− A postmenopausal state is defined  as [ADDRESS_643562] a serum  follicle -stimulating  hormone (FSH)  level  
> 40 mIU/mL  to confirm menopause.  
 
Note: Females treated with hormone replacement therapy (HRT) are likely to have artificially suppressed FSH levels and may require a washout period in order to obtain a physiologic FSH level. The duration of the washout period is a function of the type of HRT used. Suggested guidelines for  the duration  of the washout  periods  for HRT  types  are presented  below. Investigators 
should use their judgement in checking serum FSH levels. 
• 1-week  minimum for vaginal hormonal  products (rings, creams,  gels)  
• 4-week minimum for transdermal products  
• 8-week  minimum for oral products

 Other parenteral products may require washout periods as long as 6 months. If the serum FSH 
level is > 40 mIU/mL at any time during the washout period, the woman can be considered postmenopausal.  
End of Relevant Systemic  Exposure  
End of relevant systemic exposure is the timepoint where the Investigational Medicinal Product 
(IMP) or any active major metabolites have decreased to a concentration that is no longer 
considered to be relevant for human teratogenicity or fetotoxicity. This should be evaluated in context of safety  margins  from the no-observed- adverse- effect  level  or the time required for 5 half- 
lives of the IMP to pass.  
METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION  
Local  laws and regulations may  require use  of alternative  and/or  additional  contraception  methods.  
 
Highly  Effective  Contraceptive Methods  That  Are User Dependent  
Failure rate of < 1% per year when  used consistently  and correctly.a 
• Combined (estrogen - and progestogen- containing) hormonal  contraception associated with 
inhibition of ovulation and/or implantation. (This  method of contraception can only be used 
by [CONTACT_499860].)b 
− Oral (birth  control pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353])  
− Intravaginal (rings)  
− Transdermal  
• Combined (estrogen -and progestogen-containing) hormonal contraception must begin at 
least 30 days prior to initiation of study therapy.  
• Progestogen- only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation. (This 
method of contraception can only be used by [CONTACT_143971].)b 
− Oral 
− Injectable  
• Progestogen- only hormonal contraception must begin at least 30 days prior to initiation of 
study therapy.

• Intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS). (This method of contraception can only be 
used by [CONTACT_499862].)b,c 
• Bilateral tubal  occlusion.  
• Vasectomized  partner  
Having a vasectomized partner is a highly effective contraception method provided that the 
partner is the sole male sexual partner of the WOCBP and the absence of sperm has been 
confirmed. If not, an additional highly effective method of contraception should be used. 
A vasectomy  is a highly effective  contraception  method provided that the participant  is the sole 
male sexual partner of the WOCBP and the absence of sperm has been confirmed. If not, an 
additional highly effective method of contraception should be used. 
• Sexual  abstinence.  
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from  
heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatment. The reliability  of sexual  abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation  to the duration of the study 
and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant. 
• Continuous abstinence must begin  at least 30 days prior to initiation  of study therapy.  
• It is not necessary to use any other method of contraception when complete abstinence is 
elected.  
• WOCBP participants who choose complete abstinence must continue to have pregnancy 
tests, as specified in Section 2.  
• Acceptable alternate methods of highly effective contraception must be discussed in the 
event that the WOCBP participant chooses to forego complete abstinence.  
• Periodic abstinence (including, but not limited to, calendar, symptothermal, postovulation 
methods), withdrawal (coitus interruptus), spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea 
method (LAM) are not acceptable methods of contraception for this study.  
NOTES:  
a Typi[INVESTIGATOR_143852]. Use should be consistent with local regulations regarding the use of contraceptive methods for 
participants in clinical studies.  
b Hormonal contraception may be susceptible to interaction with the study treatment, which may reduce the 
efficacy of the contraceptive method. Hormonal contraception is permissible only when there is sufficient 
evidence that the IMP and other study medications will not alter hormonal exposures such that contraception 
would  be ineffective  or result  in increased  exposures  that could  be potentially  hazardous.  In this case,  alternative 
methods of contraception should be utilized. For information specific to this study regarding permissibility of hormonal contraception, refer to 
Sections 6.1  INCLUSION CRITERIA and 7.6.1  PROHIBITED AND/OR 
RESTRICTED TREATMENTS of the protocol.  
c IUSs  are acceptable methods  of contraception  in the absence  of definitive  drug interaction  studies  when  hormone 
exposures  from  intrauterine  devices  do not alter contraception  effectiveness.  For information  specific  to this

Date:[ADDRESS_643563] 1 measurable tumor lesion. When computed tomographic (CT) scans have slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness.  
At baseline, tumor lesions/lymph nodes will be categorized measurable or non -measurable as 
follows:  
1.[ADDRESS_643564] 1 dimension (longest diameter in the plane of the measurement to be recorded) with a minimum size of:  
• [ADDRESS_643565]/magnetic  resonance  imaging  (MRI)  scan (CT/MRI  scan slice thickness no 
greater than 5 mm)  
• 10-mm caliper  measurement  by [CONTACT_33162] (lesions  that cannot be accurately  
measured with calipers should be recorded as non- measurable)  
• [ADDRESS_643566]  X-ray 
• Malignant lymph nodes: To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph 
node must  be □ [ADDRESS_643567]  scan  (CT scan  slice  thickness is 
recommended to be no greater  than 5 mm). At baseline and in follow -up, only the short axis 
will be measured and followed. 
 
1.2 Non-Measurable Lesions  
• All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter <  10 mm or pathological lymph 
nodes with □ 10 to < 15 mm short axis), as well as truly non- measurable lesions  
• Lesions considered truly non- measurable include the following: leptomeningeal disease, 
ascites,  pleural  or pericardial  effusion, inflammatory  breast  disease,  lymphangitic involvement 
of the skin or lung, and abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by [CONTACT_4734] 
 
1.3 Special  Considerations Regarding Lesion Measurability  
1.3.1 Bone Lesions  
• Bone scan, positron emission tomography (PET) scan or plain films are not considered 
adequate imaging  techniques to measure bone lesions. However,  these techniques can be used 
to confirm the presence or disappearance of bone lesions. 
• Lytic  bone lesions  or mixed lytic -blastic lesions,  with identifiable  soft tissue  components that 
can be evaluated  by [CONTACT_499863],  can be considered

 as measurable lesions if the soft tissue  component meets  the definition  of measurability 
described above.  
• Blastic bone lesions are non- measurable.  
1.3.2 Cystic Lesions  
• Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be 
considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non- measurable) since they are, by 
[CONTACT_108], simple cysts.  
• ‘Cystic  lesions’  thought to represent  cystic  metastases can be considered as measurable lesions 
if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non- cystic lesions 
are present in the same subject, these are preferred for selection as target lesions.  
 
1.3.3 Lesions with Prior  Local  Treatment  
Tumor lesions  situated  in a previously irradiated  area,  or in an area subjected  to other loco-regional 
therapy, are usually not considered measurable unless there  has been  demonstrated  progression in 
the lesion. 
1.4 Specifications by [CONTACT_129918]  
1.4.1 Measurement of Lesions  
All measurements  should be recorded  in metric  notation (mm).  All baseline evaluations should be 
performed as close as possible to the treatment start and never more than 30 days before the 
beginning of the treatment. 
1.4.2 Method of Assessment  
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. Imaging- based  evaluation should 
always be done rather than clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being followed cannot be 
imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_12148].  
[IP_ADDRESS] CT/MRI Scan  
CT/MRI is the best currently available and reproducible method to measure lesions selected for response assessment. Measurability of lesions on CT/MRI scan is based on the assumption that CT/MRI slice thickness is [ADDRESS_643568] slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Chest X -ray 
Chest CT is preferred over chest X -ray, particularly when progression is an important endpoint, 
since CT is more sensitive than X -ray, particularly in identifying new lesions. However, lesions 
on chest  X-ray may be considered measurable if they are clearly  defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_14238].

 [IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Lesions  
Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial and ≥  10 mm 
diameter as assessed using calipers. For the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_30575] a  ruler to estimate the size of the lesion is  suggested. As previously noted, 
when lesions can be evaluated by [CONTACT_197302], imaging evaluation should be undertaken since it is more objective and may also be reviewed at the end of the study.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Ultrasound  
Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used as a method of 
measurement.  If new lesions  are identified  by [CONTACT_12153], confirmation 
by [CONTACT_12154].

The utilization  of these techniques for objective tumor evaluation is not advised.  
2 BASELINE  DOCUMENTATION OF ‘TARGET’  AND ‘NON -TARGET’ 
LESIONS  
2.1 Target Lesions  
When  more  than 1 measurable lesion  is present  at baseline all lesions up to a maximum of 5 lesions 
total (and a maximum of 2 lesions per organ) representative of all involved organs should be 
identified as target lesions and will be recorded and measured at baseline.  
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), 
should be representative of all involved organs, and should lend themselves to reproducible 
repeated measurements. 
A sum of the diameters (longest for non- nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target 
lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters. If lymph nodes are to be included in  the sum, then as noted  below, only the short axis is added into the sum.  The baseline 
sum diameters  will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in 
the measurable dimension of the disease.  
2.1.[ADDRESS_643569] meet  the criterion  of a short  axis of 
≥ [ADDRESS_643570] a short axis < 10 mm are considered non-pathological and should not be recorded 
or followed. 
2.2 Non-Target  Lesions  
All other lesions (or sites of disease) including pathological lymph nodes should be identified as 
non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements are not required and 
these lesions  should  be followed  as ‘present’ , ‘absent’ , or in rare cases ‘unequivocal

 progression’ . In addition, it is possible to record multiple non- target lesions involving the same 
organ as a single item on the case record form (eg, ‘multiple enlarged pelvic lymph nodes’ or 
‘multiple liver metastases’).  
3 TUMOR  RESPONSE EVALUATION  
3.1 Evaluation of Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR) :  Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes 
(whether target or non- target) must have reduction in short axis to < 10 mm.  
Partial  Response ( PR): At least a 30%  decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions , taking 
as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
Progressive Disease (PD) : At  least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, 
taking  as reference the smallest  sum on study  (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest 
on study). In addition  to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute 
increase of at least 5  mm. ( Note: The appearance of 1 or more new lesions is also considered 
progression.)  
Stable Disease (SD) : Ne ither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.  
3.1.1 S pecial  Notes  on the Assessment  of Target Lesions  
[IP_ADDRESS] Lymph Nodes 
Lymph nodes merit special  mention since they are normal anatomical  structures  that may be visible 
by [CONTACT_499864]. Pathological  nodes that are defined as measurable  and 
may be identified  as target lesions must  meet  the criterion  of a short  axis of ≥ [ADDRESS_643571]  a short axis 
< 10 mm are considered  non-pathological and should not be recorded  or followed.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Target  Lesions That  Become ‘Too Small  to Measure’  
All lesions (nodal and non- nodal) recorded at baseline should have their actual measurements 
recorded  at each subsequent evaluation,  even  when  very small (eg, 2 mm).  If the radiologist is able 
to provide an actual measurement, that should be recorded, even if it is below [ADDRESS_643572]  measure to then:  
• If it is the opi[INVESTIGATOR_26191], the measurement 
should be recorded as 0 mm. 
• If the lesion is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a default 
value of 5 mm should be assigned (note: in case of a lymph node believed to be present and faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm should be assigned in this circumstance as well).  This default value is derived from the 5- mm CT slice thickness 
(but should not be changed with varying CT slice thickness).

 [IP_ADDRESS] Target  Lesions That  Split or Coalesce on Treatment  
• When non- nodal lesions ‘fragment’,  the longest diameters of  the fragmented portions should 
be added together to calculate the target lesion sum.  
• As lesions coalesce, a plane between them may be maintained that would aid in obtaining 
maximal  diameter measurements of each individual lesion. If the lesions have  truly  coalesced 
such that they are no longer separable,  the vector  of the longest diameter  in this instance  should 
be the maximal longest diameter for the ‘coalesced lesion’.  
 
3.2 Evaluation of Non-Target  Lesions  
While  some  non- target  lesions may actually  be measurable,  they need  not be measured  and instead 
should be assessed only qualitatively at the timepoints specified in the protocol. 
Complete  Response (CR):  Disappearance of all non- target  lesions . All lymph  nodes must be non- 
pathological in size (< 10 mm short axis).  
Non-CR/Non -P D: Persistence of 1 or more  non- target  lesion(s) above the normal limits.  
Progressive Disease (PD):  Unequivocal progression of existing non- target lesions. (Note: The 
appearance of 1 or more new lesions is also considered progression.) 
3.2.1 S pecial  Notes  on Assessment  of Non-Target  Lesions  
The concept  of progression of non- target disease requires additional explanation as follows:  
[IP_ADDRESS] When the Subject Also Has Measurable Disease  
• To achieve ‘unequivocal  progression’ on the basis of the non- target disease, there must be an 
overall level of  substantial worsening in non- target disease such that, even in the presence of 
SD or PR in target disease, the overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit 
discontinuation of therapy. 
• A modest ‘increase’ in the size of 1 or more non -target lesions is usually not sufficient to 
quality for unequivocal progression status.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] When the Subject Has Only Non- Measurable Disease  
• To achieve ‘unequivocal  progression’ on the basis of the non- target disease, there must be an 
overall level of substantial worsening such that the overall tumor burden has increased 
sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy. 
• A modest ‘increase’ in the size of 1 or more non -target lesions is usually not sufficient to 
qualify for unequivocal progression status.  
• Because worsening in non- target disease cannot be easily quantified (by [CONTACT_108]: if all 
lesions are non- measurable), a useful test that can be applied when assessing subjects for 
unequivocal progression is to consider if the increase in overall disease burden based on the 
change in non- measurable disease is comparable in magnitude to the increase that would be 
required to declare PD for measurable  disease:  that is, an increase  in tumor burden representing 
an additional  73% increase in ‘volume’ (which is equivalent to a 20% increase diameter in a 
measurable lesion). Examples include an increase in a pleural  effusion from ‘trace’ to ‘large’

 or an increase in lymphangitic disease from localized to widespread or may be described in 
protocols as ‘sufficient to require a change in therapy’. 
• If ‘unequivocal  progression’ is seen, the subject should be considered to have had overall PD 
at that point.  
 
3.3 New Lesions  
The appearance of new malignant lesions denotes disease progression. The finding  of a new lesion 
should be unequivocal: that is, not attributable to differences in scanning technique, change in 
imaging modality or findings thought to represent something other than tumor (eg, some ‘new’ bone lesions may be simply healing or flare of preexisting lesions).  This is  particularly  important 
when  the subject’s baseline lesions show partial or complete  response.  For example,  necrosis of a 
liver lesion may be reported on a CT scan report as a ‘new’ cystic lesion, which it is not.  
A lesion  identified  on a follow-up study  in an anatomical  location that was not scanned  at baseline 
is considered  a new lesion  and will indicate  disease progression. An  example  of this  is the subject 
who has visceral disease at baseline and while on study has a CT or MRI brain scan ordered that reveals metastases. The subject’s brain metastases are considered to be evidence of PD even if he/she did not have brain imaging at baseline. 
If a new lesion  is equivocal, for example because  of its small  size, continued  therapy and follow -up 
evaluation will clarify  if it represents truly  new disease. If repeat  scans confirm there is definitely 
a new lesion, then progression should be declared using the date of the initial scan. 
3.3.1 FDG -PET Evaluation  
While [
18F] fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) -PET response assessments need additional study, it is 
sometimes reasonable to incorporate the use of the qualitative assessment of FDG -PET scanning 
to complement CT scanning in assessment of progression (particularly possible ‘new’ disease). 
New lesions on the basis of FDG -PET imaging can be identified according to the following 
algorithm: 
• Negative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at follow -up is a sign of  PD based 
on a new lesion. 
• No FDG- PET at baseline  and a positive FDG- PET at follow -up: 
− If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by 
[CONTACT_4654], this is PD.  
− If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, 
additional follow -up CT scans are needed to determine if there is truly progression 
occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial  positive  FDG- PET 
scan).

Missing Assessments and Not Evaluable Designation  
When  no imaging/measurement  is done at all at a particular timepoint,  the subject  is not evaluable 
(NE)  at that timepoint.  If only a subset of lesion  measurements  are made at an assessment,  the case 
is also considered NE at that timepoint, unless a convincing argument can be made that the 
contribution of the individual missing lesion(s) would not have changed the assigned timepoint response.

 4.1.1 Confirmation Scans 
• Verification of Response: Confirmation of PR and CR is required at least [ADDRESS_643574] Overall Response: All Timepoints  
The best overall response is determined once all the data for the subject are known. It is the best 
response recorded from the start of  the study treatment until the date of objectively documented 
progression based on RECIST v1.1, taking into account any requirement for confirmation, or the 
date of subsequent anti -cancer therapy, whichever occurs first in the study. The subject’s best 
overall response assignment  will depend on the findings of both target  and non- target  disease and 
will also take into consideration the appearance of new lesions.  
Best response is defined as the best response across all timepoints with  subsequent confirmation. 
Complete  or partial  responses may be claimed  only if the criteria  for each  are met  at a subsequent 
timepoint as specified in the protocol (generally 4 weeks later).  
In this circumstance,  the best overall response can be interpreted  as specified  in Table  4.2-1. When 
SD is believed to be best response, it must meet the protocol specified minimum time from 
baseline.  Measurements  must have met the SD criteria  at least once after study entry  at a minimum 
interval (in general, not less than 6 to 8 weeks) that is defined in the study protocol.

 APPENDIX 9  NEW  YORK HEART  ASSOCIATION (NYHA)  FUNCTIONAL 
CLASSIFICATION  
Heart failure is usually classified according to the severity of their symptoms. The table below 
describes the most commonly used classification system, the [LOCATION_001] Heart Association (NYHA)  Functional Classification.  It places patients  in one of four categories based  on how much 
they are limited during physical activity. 
 
Class  Patient Symptoms  
I No limitation  of physical activity.  Ordinary  physical activity  does not cause undue 
fatigue, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_332], dyspnea (shortness of breath). 
II Slight limitation  of physical activity.  Comfortable  at rest. Ordinary  physical

 APPENDIX  10    CONSORT  PUBLISHING  REQUIREMENTS  
The Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) encompasses various initiatives 
developed by [CONTACT_499865].  
The CONSORT  Statement  
The main product of CONSORT is the CONSORT Statement, which is an evidence -based, 
minimum set of recommendations for reporting randomized trials. It offers a standard way for authors to prepare reports of trial findings, facilitating their complete and transparent reporting, and aiding  their critical  appraisal  and interpretation. CONSORT  [ADDRESS_643579]  and flow diagram are freely 
available for viewing and downloading at the CONSORT website (http://www.consort - 
statement.org/consort-2010). The CONSORT  Statement  is endorsed  by [CONTACT_499866], 
specialty medical journals, and leading editorial organizations. CONSORT is part of a broader effort, to improve the reporting of different types of health research, and indeed, to improve the quality of research used in decision- making in healthcare.  
CONSORT  2010 Guideline  
The CONSORT (CONsolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) 2010 guideline is intended to improve the reporting of parallel -group randomized controlled trial (RCT), enabling readers to 
understand a trial's design, conduct, analysis and interpretation, and to assess the validity of its results. This can only be achieved through complete adherence and transparency by [CONTACT_120667]. CONSORT 2010 was developed through collaboration and consensus between clinical trial 
methodologists, guideline developers, knowledge translation  specialists,  and journal editors 
(see CONSORT group  ). CONSORT 2010 is the current version of  the guideline and supersedes 
the 2001 and 1996 versions. 
CONSORT  “Explanation and Elaboration” Document  
The CONSORT “Explanation and Elaboration” document explains and illustrates the principles 
underlying the CONSORT Statement, and should preferably be used in conjunction with the CONSORT  Statement.  In addition, extensions of  the CONSORT Statement have been  developed 
to give additional guidance for  RCTs  with specific designs,  data and interventions. The CONSORT 
website ( http://www.consort-statement.org/consort-2010)  contains the current definitive version 
of the CONSORT 2010 Statement and up- to-date information on extensions.

DESIGN  
1 BLRM  MODEL  SETUP FOR  BMS -986207 MONOTHERAPY  
1.1 Monotherapy Methodology Description  
An adaptive 2- parameter Bayesian Logistic Regression Model  (BLRM) guided by [CONTACT_499867] (EWOC)  principle1,2,3 will be used to guide the dose escalation  of 
BMS -986207 monotherapy in the monotherapy phase, providing dose recommendation during 
dose escalation.  
The BLRM will be fitted on the dose -limiting toxicity (DLT) data during the first 4 weeks of 
treatment accumulated throughout the dose escalation to model the dose -toxicity relationship of 
BMS -986207 in the monotherapy dose escalation phase. 
The dose -toxicity relationships for BMS -986207 monotherapy is assumed to follow a logistic 
model:  
logit (pi) = log(a1) + {31log(d1ij ∗), 
1 
where pi [INVESTIGATOR_499775]  d1i. Note that the a 1 and {31 parameters are 
assumed positive, and d∗ is the reference dose for BMS -986207 (please refer to the meaning of 
a1 and {3 1 in Section 1.2.1 for detailed implementation). 
1.2 Prior  Specification for BMS- 986207 Monotherapy  
The Bayesian approach requires the specification of prior distributions for model parameters, 
which include parameters ( a1, {31) for BMS -986207. The prior distributions for BMS -986207 
single agent  activity  were  derived  using a weakly  informative  prior,  as well as discussion with the 
Bristol -Myers Squibb (BMS) clinical team.  
Derivation  of prior distribution  of these  parameters is provided in the following  subsections.  
1.2.1 Prior Derivation for  BMS -986207 Parameters  (log (a1), log (P 1)) 
A weakly informative prior will be used for parameters (a 1, {31) for BMS -[ADDRESS_643580] the 
potential of the different toxicities of BMS -986207 and allow for considerable prior uncertainty. 
Further details  are provided  below.  
Weakly Informative Prior  
• The median  DLT  rate at the reference  dose (BMS -986207 at 1600 mg qd) was assumed to be 
30%, that is, mean (log( a1)) = logit (0.3) = log(0.3/(1 -0.3)) = -0.847. 
• A doubling in dos e was assumed  to double the odds of DLT,  that is, mean(log( {31)) = 0. 
• The standard  deviation of log( a1) was  set to 1.53 using the following steps:

 • If the toxicity probability range was set to be [1%, 99%], then the toxicity interval would be 
logit (0.99) -logit (0.01) = 9.19. 
• To cover 99.7%  of the variance,  the toxicity  interval will cover  6*sd (log( a1)), which  gives us 
sd (log( a1)) = 9.19/6 = 1.53. 
 
Correspondingly, the standard deviation of log( {31) was set to 1, which allows for considerably 
larger prior uncertainty for the dose toxicity.  
1) The correlation  between  log( a1) and log( {31) was set to 0. 
2) log(a1) and log( {31) follow  a bivariate  normal distribution.

2 BLRM  MODEL  SETUP FOR  BMS- 986207 AND NIVOLUMAB 
COMBINATION  
2.1 Methodology Description for Combination Therapy  
Toxicity profiles of both BMS -986207 monotherapy and nivolumab monotherapy will be 
incorporated to develop the combination model framework. A copula -type model will be used to 
cover all general combination cases, including additive and synergistic effects. The combination 
of the 2 treatments will be explored using a Bayesian hierarchical model by [CONTACT_499868]. The following copula- 
type model4 will be used to describe the probability pij of toxicity when dose level i of agent A 
and dose level j of agent B are administered in combination:  
m 1/ n 1/y yl 
pij = 1 − exp(− [ {−log(1 − pi )} yl + {−log(1 − qj )} l]  ), 
where p i is the prespecified  best guess toxicity  probability  for agent A, qj is the prespecified  best 
guess toxicity  probability for agent B, m and n characterize the individual drug effect,  and 
y1 characterizes the drug -drug interactive effect.  
The joint toxicity framework models the toxicity rates of both agents as well as their interaction 
effects in a 7 -parameter hierarchical model, where each monotherapy dose- toxicity relationship 
will be characterized by a 2 -parameter BLRM model (see Section 1.1 ). There are 3 additional 
parameters for the copula -type model, 1 for each agent ( m and n) as well as 1 for the interaction 
term (y 1). A dose -toxicity surface will be characterized for different dose combinations of these  
2 agents. 
As there are currently no historical data  or prior knowledge to indicate how much information is 
to be borrowed for each of the single  agents,  parameters  m and n are both set to  be 1, meaning

2 borrowing 100% of the information from  the 2 agents. The above formula is then simplified into 
a 5-parameter model as follows:  
1/ 1/y yl 
pij = 1 − exp(− [ {− log(1 − pi)} yl + {− log(1 − qj)} l]  . 
 
 
Since only a fixed nivolumab dose (240 mg) will be used in the BMS -986207 and nivolumab 
combination, this surface will be simplified into a 2 -dimensional dose -toxicity curve. Posteriors 
for the corresponding 5 parameters (2 logistic  regression  parameters  [a1, {31] for BMS -986207 and 
2 logistic regression  parameters [ a2, {32] for nivolumab, as well as 1 interaction  parameter  for the 
copula- type model [ y1, which will be discussed in detail in the following section]) will be fitted 
into the in -house developed model. It implements the above- described theoretical setup.  
2.2 Prior  Specification for Combination Therapy  
2.2.1 Marginal  Prior for BMS -986207  
Posterior information on log( α1) and log( β1) from the monotherapy  part of  the study will be used 
as marginal BMS -986207 prior for combination with nivolumab. This prior information is not 
prespecified and will be continuously updated when additional DLT information from the 
monotherapy is available.  In the simulation  (see Section  3, the  prior of  BMS -986207 as described 
in Section 1.2.1 (Table 1 ) is used for illustration purposes because no real -time DLT data are 
available at this time.  
2.2.2 Marginal  Prior  Derivation for Nivolumab Parameters (log( α2), log(β2)) 
Similar to BMS -986207 monotherapy in the monotherapy phase,  the logistic  model for nivolumab 
is as follows: 
logit (qj) = log(a2) + {32log(d2jj ∗), 
2 
where  qj is the probability  of toxicity  at dose level  d2j. Note  that the a2 and {32 parameters  are 
assumed positive, and d∗ is the reference dose for nivolumab.  
The toxicity  profile  of nivolumab has been  studied in several  studies.  A bivariate  normal prior for 
the nivolumab model parameters (log( α2), log( β2)) was obtained by [CONTACT_121698] a posterior of 
nivolumab using DLT  and safety  data from the Study CA209003, which  is used later as the meta - 
analytical -predictive (MAP) prior for nivolumab.  
The MAP  prior for the model parameters (log(α2), log(β2)) was obtained in the following  steps. 
First, a prior distribution for nivolumab was developed: 
• The medianb  DLT  rate at the reference dose (3 mg/kg every  2 weeks)  was assumed  to be 10%, 
that is, mean (log( α2)) = logit(1/10) = log(1/9) = -2.197.  
• A doubling in dose was assumed  to double odds of DLT,  that is, mean(log( β2)) = 0. 
• The standard  deviation of log( α2) was set to 2, and the standard  deviation  of log( β2) to 1, which 
allows for considerable prior uncertainty for the dose -toxicity profile.

 • The correlation between log( α2) and log( β2) is assumed to be 0 (assuming independence of 
log(α2) and log( β2)). 
• In addition, heterogeneity between the historical study and current study was incorporated 
using a meta -analytic  predictive approach by [CONTACT_499869] -trial standard  deviations τ1 and 
τ2 for log( α2) and log( β2), respectively. The between- trial variability is assumed to be 
moderate. Therefore, τ 1 and τ2 were set to follow a log -normal distribution, with mean 
log(0.25) and log(0.125), respectively, with a common standard deviation log(2)/1.96. 
 
With  this prior, the clinical  trial data below (Table  2) were  used to generate the posterior for 
nivolumab, which is then used as the MAP prior for this study (Table 3).

Note:  Nivolumab prior information was  based  on a milligram -per-kilogram dosing instead of flat 
dosing. If real pharmacokinetic (PK)  data from this study show difference  from  the milligram- per- 
kilogram assumption, the nivolumab prior will be revisited and modified accordingly. 
2.2.[ADDRESS_643582] the current 
uncertainty  about  the toxicity  profile of the combination  of BMS -986207 and nivolumab. Although 
no PK drug -drug interaction is expected, the possibility of a significant positive interaction 
between BMS -986207 and nivolumab cannot be totally excluded. The interaction parameter γ1 
was chosen accordingly but with a degree of uncertainty to allow for the possibility that the 
interaction may be positive or negative. Therefore, the following assumptions are made for the interaction parameter:

 • γ1 follows  a gamma  distribution  and with a mean  centered  at 1.1, which  means  the combination 
of [ADDRESS_643583].  
• The 97.5 percentile of γ 1 is log(3), that is, a [ADDRESS_643584] probability to there being small synergistic interaction and also 
allows  for the potential of larger synergism of the toxic profiles.  It also does not completely  ignore 
the possibility  of antagonism because there is a 40% prior probability that γ1 is less than 1.  
3 BLRM  DECISION  RULE FOR  DOSE ESCALATION  AND SIMULATION  
Dose escalation recommendations for BMS -986207 monotherapy and in combination with 
nivolumab will be based  on the inference from the Bayesian  posterior and the probability that the 
true DLT rate for each dose lies in 1 of the following categories:  
• [0%,  16%)  under- dosing 
• [16%, 33%)  targeted  toxicity  
• [33%, 100%]  excessive toxicity  
 
These boundaries are similar to the toxicity boundaries used by a rule -based design (ie, 3 + 3 
design) in that a minimum is set at 16% (~ 1 in 6) DLT  rate and a maximum  at 33% (~ 2 in 6) DLT 
rate. Following the principle of EWOC, dose  recommendations for  the next cohort will be based 
on the Bayesian model after DLT information becomes available during the DLT period, 
accounting for all of  the available data from the administered doses, and the candidate doses are 
the ones fulfilling the overdose criterion that  there is less than 30% chance of excessive toxicity. 
Only the candidate doses will be considered for the next cohort. While the Bayesian model will use DLT information from the DLT period  only, clinical assessment will take into consideration 
of the totality of available data including PK/  from all treated participants.  
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]  R
ules:  
The following is the general  stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_499776]  (-Copula) during Dose  Escalation:  
• If all of 30 DLT  evaluable participants  are treated.  
• If all of the current pre- specified  doses are considered  intolerable  according to the pre- specified 
cutoff (ie, EWOC  criteria),  then the model will recommend  stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_499777] 
a new dose level lower than the current lowest dose level  will need to be identified.  
• The maximum number of participants in a dose level will be 12. This limit is set to avoid 
instances in  which  the model could recommend  adding subjects  indefinitely  to a specific dose 
level due to uncertainty in the tolerability profile.  
• If, for a specific dose level,  [ADDRESS_643585] been  treated  and the chance of determining  that the 
dose level  to be the “target” dose is > 50%, then the model will suggest to stop and declare the 
current dose level to be MTD.  
• Mo del -recommended MTD:  
• The MTD  is the dose that satisfies  the following 3 conditions:

 • (1) The empi[INVESTIGATOR_499762] ‘DLT  rate of 16% -< 33%’  is greater  than 50%,  
• (2) This probability  needs  to be the largest  among the dose levels  that satisfy  the EWOC 
condition (ie, the probability that ‘DLT rate ≥ 33%’ must be less than 30%);  
• (3) Minimum number of participants  (ie, 6), were  treated  at this dose level.  
 
Final  M TD/RP2D:  
The final recommended MTD/RP2D will be based on the recommendation from the 
BLRM/BLRM -copula and overall clinical  assessment  of all available  safety,  PK/  and efficacy 
data.  Lower  doses of BMS -[ADDRESS_643586]

The average sample size was no more than 20 participants. The results show how the EWOC 
principle limits the risk of exposing participants from  unacceptable toxic dose levels, eg, 50% or 
above. Overall, the scenarios illustrated above demonstrate that the model performs well by [CONTACT_499871] 50% to 83% in the hypothetical scenarios investigated 
while limiting participants from receiving unacceptable toxic dose levels  
4 BLRM  INTERIM  MONITORING CASE STUDY TO ILLUSTRATE 
PROVISION OF DOSE RECOMMENDATIONS DURING DOSE- 
ESCALATION 
In order to provide a comprehensive view of the dynamics of the models, different hypothetical 
scenarios exploring all possibilities are examined. For the simplicity of illustration purposes, a static cohort size of  3 subjects is applied for dose levels 80 mg, 240 mg, 800 mg and 1600 mg in 
the BMS -986207 monotherapy and for the dose level  80 mg in the combination  setting. This cohort 
size could vary during the actual  clinical  trial, and the BLRM  (-Copula) models are designed to fit 
various different cohort sizes, adaptively. In general, there are 4 possible scenarios for a specific dose level,  which  are 0 DLT  observed in 3 total subjects in that cohort (denoted as 0/3), 1 DLT

During interim monitoring, posterior probabilities will be updated when there is new DLT information available. The following three visualization plots will be produced to reflect  the real 
time dose- DLT  relationship, to quantify benefit (in the form of target dosing) and risk (in the form 
of overdosing and underdosing) during model’s  recommendation process,  and to facilitate  clinical 
team’s interpretation of the model recommendations for the final decision making:  
• Dose -DLT  profile  for the doses ranging between  0 mg and 1600 mg (Figure  1). 
• Stacking histograms displaying predictive probabilities  on DLT  rates  classified  into 3 different 
categories (Underdosing, Target dosing and Overdosing) ( Figure 2).  
• Box plots summarizing the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samples of predicted DLT

Interpretation  and usage  of Figure  1: 
Figure 1 is a snapshot of an updated dose -DLT profile with DLT information available at dose 
level 80 mg for combination studies. The dose -DLT profile is captured with a continuous dose 
spectrum ranging from 0 mg to 1600 mg, which is a slice of the dose -DLT surface of the 
combination of two  drugs with  Nivolumab fixed  at 240 mg. For each dose within  the range, there 
is a corresponding distribution  of the predicted  DLT  rates calculated  from  the posterior samples of 
the model parameters.  This figure will be updated each time new DLT  information  becomes

available from the combination studies. Similar graphs will also be produced for the BMS -986207 
monotherapy.  
In Figure  1, there are 3 different quantiles (2.5%, 50%, and 97.5%) plotted to characterize the 
current  trend  of the toxicity  profile  (as shown by [CONTACT_941] 50%  quantile), as well  as the  variation  of the 
dose- DLT profile (as shown by [CONTACT_941] 2.5% percentile and the 97.5% percentile), according to the 
accumulation of DLT data from all previous and current dose levels. The toxicity boundaries 
(0.16 and 0.33) are illustrated in two dotted horizontal lines to benchmark the way in which the 
dose-DLT profile is trending. 
Intermediate  dose levels  can be identified  using different  boundary cutoffs.  For example,  using the 
50% percentile curve (green highlight), which represents the nearly average DLT distribution for 
each dose level,  the 300 mg could be a potential intermediate  dose level  corresponding to the lower 
pre-specified DLT rate boundary of 0.16, and the 1600 mg could be a fitted MTD dose level 
associated with the upper boundary of 0.33. 
Moreover, if all of the current pre -specified doses are considered intolerable (overdosing 
probabilities >  0.3 for combination therapy, a case not shown on the current Figure 1),  the model 
will recommend to stop the current dose level, and the clinical team can leverage the current 
updated dose -DLT curve to pi[INVESTIGATOR_263097] a new dose, which is lower than pre -specified lowest dose 
(80 mg) by [CONTACT_499872].

 Interpretation  and usage  of Figure  2: 
Figure [ADDRESS_643588] exclude doses that are intolerable 
(with overdosing probabilities >  30%, the rate that has been specified for BMS -986207 in 
combination with nivolumab). Among those qualified candidate doses that are considered 
“tolerable”,  the model will select  the dose that maximizes  the probability of being within  the target 
toxicity range (DLT rate of 16% up to 33%).  
As illustrated  in Figure [ADDRESS_643589], dose levels of 800 mg 
and 1600 mg for BMS -986207 are excluded according to the higher -than-cutoff (0.3 for 
combination therapy) overdosing probabilities (0.364 for 800mg and 0.503 for 1600mg). Among 
the remainder of tolerable  dose levels  (80 mg and 240 mg), the BLRM -Copula model recommends 
the dose  that maximizes the probability of being within the target dosing interval. Therefore, the 
model’s recommendation would be to escalate to [ADDRESS_643590] target dosing probability of 0.342 compared with that of 80 mg (0.231). 
Similarly (although not shown on Figure 2 ), according to the rules specified above, the model 
could possibly recommend to de -escalate to a lower dose level than current treated dose level, 
extend the current dose level,  or even  recommend  to stop and identify  a new dose level  lower  than 
80mg, the lowest pre -specified dose level. Please refer to description of Figure 1 for details on 
how to specify the new dose levels.

Interpretation  and usage  of Figure  3: 
Figure 3 is a snapshot with DLT information available at dose level 80 mg for the combination 
setting. The dose- DLT  distributions  calculated  from  the posterior samples of the model parameters 
are characterized in the format of boxplots for the pre -specified dose levels. This figure will be

This plot supplements the information provided in Figure 1 . It allows for a more in -depth and 
focused visualization of general trend of dose -DLT relationship, as well as the magnitude and 
variability in the DLT rates for each pre -specified dose level. 
4.1 Example of the BLRM  using BMS- 986207 Monotherapy Dose Escalation  
According to safety consideration and clinical judgement, the dose level 80 mg is recommended as the starting  dose for BMS -986207 monotherapy. With  the current  BMS -986207 prior specified 
in the Section  1.2.1 and all available DLT  information  up to 240 mg, a corresponding decision tree 
illustrating  various models’  recommendations under  all possible scenarios (for dose levels of 800 
mg and 1600 mg) is provided in Figure [ADDRESS_643591] branch of the tree  as an example, starting  at 80 mg, there  was 0 DLT observed at 
80 mg in the real clinical  trial, the model  recommended  to escalate to 240 mg (The  BLRM  actually 
recommends escalating to dose level  800 mg but since this is a 10 fold increrase of dose and this

type of dose skippi[INVESTIGATOR_499779]  240 mg is selected),  one level  above the current 
treated dose level according escalation rules per protocol (as detailed in Protocol Section 5.1). 
Additionally,  there  was 0 DLT  observed  at 240 mg in real data,  the model recommended  to escalate 
further one dose level to 800 mg. 
As illustrated  in Figure 4, there  are 6 potential decision  paths for  dose levels 800 mg  and moving 
onwards up to 800 mg. During the actual  clinical study, the tree would be narrowed or deepened 
based on actual DLT. The clinical team will be able to leverage this decision tree to preview 
decisions at each interim monitoring step and to plan proactively.

5 BOIN  ESCALATION DESIGN SIMULATION  WITH  2 DOSE LEVELS,  PART  
1C 
The Bayesian optimal interval (BOIN) design framework will be used to guide the safety 
evaluation of BMS -986207 in combination with nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_499780] 1C. The design 
is typi[INVESTIGATOR_499781] (MTD)  selection in  cases where  more 
doses are evaluated.5,6 
As a single dose level  of BMS -986207 will be evaluated  in this triplet  combination  (with  potential 
for a de -escalation if needed), the goal in this study part is to assess if the dose is tolerable. 
Therefore  MTD  reference  below (as in typi[INVESTIGATOR_236357]- dose level  design) represents a ‘tolerable

 dose’ in Part 1C. As an escalation  decision is not  of interest in Part 1C, a design recommendation 
to declare a dose as tolerable is based on meeting the same criteria needed to escalate.  
The target toxicity rate for the MTD is ɸ = 0.[ADDRESS_643592] dose assignment, to guide dose escalation/de- escalation:  
• If the observed  DLT  rate at the current dose is ≤ 0.236, declare the dose tolerable;  
• If it is ≥ 0.359, de- escalate the dose to the next lower  dose level; 
• Otherwise, stay  at the current  dose. 
 
The design MTD selection approach described next, is included for general information on the 
design; however, it is not  used in this study. After the trial is completed,  selection  of the MTD is 
based on isotonic regression as specified in Liu and Yuan (2015).[ADDRESS_643593] the lower dose level when the isotonic estimate is greater than or equal to the target DLT rate. 
5.1 Operating characteristics of BOIN  design with 2 dose levels  
Table 6 shows the operating characteristics of the trial design based on 1000 simulations of the 
trial using the BOIN Design  Desktop Program.
7 The operating characteristics  show that the design 
selects the true MTD (tolerable dose), if  any, with high probability and allocates more patients to 
the dose levels with the DLT rate closest to the target of 0.3.

 APPENDIX  13    PRELIMINARY SAFETY COHORT  
1 PRELIMINARY SAFETY COHORT  FOR  PHASE 1, PART  1A 
1.1 Justification for the Preliminary Safety Cohort  (PSC):  
The FIH starting dose of BMS -986207 monotherapy, as an immune -mediated anti -cancer agent, 
was determined using both toxicology- and pharmacology- (  efficacy) -based 
approaches to ensure participant  safety  while  limiting  the number of participants  receiving  
nonpharmacologically active doses. The toxicology -based approach utilized the HNSTD 
determined from a 1 -month repeat -dose toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys. The 
pharmacology- based  approach  leveraged  the pharmacology data (ie,  efficacy)  obtained 
from mouse surrogates to project the human effective  dose, from  which  the FIH starting  dose was 
selected.  The starting  doses determined  from  both approaches were  integrated,  and the lower  dose 
of 1 mg/kg (or  80 mg  flat dose, assuming  an average body weight of  80 kg in cancer  participants) 
was recommended as the starting monotherapy dose for BMS -986207. 
Subsequent to discussions with FDA, to further ensure a sufficient safety margin for the 
monotherapy starting dose, given the absence of previous clinical experience with BMS -986207, 
a Preliminary Safety Cohort (PSC) was added to the study. In the PSC, a single participant will receive BMS -[ADDRESS_643595] administration  of the 20- mg dose for each of the 3 participants in the PSC, if 
no DLT is observed, the main study protocol will begin  with participants  receiving  BMS -986207 
monotherapy at the 80 mg dose level.  If a DLT  is observed in the PSC,  the BLRM  will be initiated. 
A decision  whether to treat additional patients  at the same dose level,  or escalate the dose, will be 
based on a recommendation from the BLRM and overall clinical assessment with all the safety, pharmacokinetic  data..

 tudy Design for PSC:  
In the PSC,  the first cohort of 3 participants  will be administered  intravenous (IV) doses of BMS - 
986207 as follows: 
The starting dose of [ADDRESS_643596] to the study design, study population, treatment,

endpoints have been added that are specific to Parts 1C and 2C. A secondary objective related to 
has been  changed because known downstream 
are not specific to TIGIT,  but instead  are measures of general  increases  
in inflammation  in the tumor.  
Other key changes include additional schedule of activities tables, pharmacokinetic sampling 
tables,  for Parts 1C and 2C, and response to the SARS -Cov-2 
pandemic. Information within the appendices, including adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs (SAEs; Appendix 3), contraceptive methods ( Appendix 4), and immune -mediated AE 
management algorithms ( Appendix 6) have been updated to align with BMS standard language 
and the most recent safety information for investigational products used in this study. Minor editorial changes have been made throughout the protocol  and the Synopsis has been amended to

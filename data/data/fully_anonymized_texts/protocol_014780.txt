 Synopsis 
 
NUMBER AND TITLE OF STUDY:  
1932-701-008: A multicenter, single-blind, randomized, controlled study of the safety and effectiveness of 
JUVÉDERM VOLBELLA® XC injectable gel for correct ion of infraorbital hollowing 
DEVELOPMENT PHASE:  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_249745]:  Up to 15 [LOCATION_002] centers 
NUMBER OF SUBJECTS: Up to 175 subjects will be enrolled and 140 subjects will be randomized 
OBJECTIVES:  
The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of JUVÉDERM VOLBELLA XC 
injectable gel (hereafter , VOLBELLA XC) in adult subjects seekin g correction of infraorbital hollowing. 
Study design:  
This is a prospective, multicenter, evaluator-blinded, randomized, controlled study to evaluate the safety and 
effectiveness of VOLBELLA XC hyalur onic acid (HA) injectable gel to correct infraorbital hollowing. Once 
screened, subj ects will be randomized to either  the treatment or control group.  The treatment group will receive 
treatment at the start of the study and an optional touc h-up treatment 1 month later. They will be followed for 
safety and effectiveness for 12 months with the option for a repeat treatment and an additional month of follow-
up. The control group will complete a 3-month control phase after randomization and will be offered optional treatment and optional touch-up treatment 1 month later. They will be followed only for safety for 9 months. 
At screening, after written informed consent has been given, the Treating Investigator (TI) will document the 
subject’s demographics, height, weight, vital signs, Fitzpatrick skin phototype, and history of sun exposure, 
smoking, and medical, surgical, dental, and cosmetic proc edures. Female subjects of childbearing potential will 
undergo urine pregnancy tests. The Evaluating Investigator (EI) will rate subjects on the 5-point photonumeric 
Allergan Infraorbital Hollows Scale (AIHS) to determ ine eligibility for the study. The TI will ensure the 
subject’s anatomy is amenable  to correction to an AIHS rating of 0 or 1  
Before randomization, 
subjects will undergo All subjects will be randomized 3:1 to the 
treatment group or the control group, and will also be ra ndomized 1:[ADDRESS_303587] be used for all treatments. 
Treatment group : Before treatment, subjects randomized to the treatment group will complete the following 
assessments: 
• FACE-Q Appraisal of Lower Eyelids questionnaire 
• TI (or designee) safety assessments 
o Snellen visual acuity using a Snellen eye chart 
o confrontational visual fields 
o ocular motility 
The TI will use supplied 32G ½ ″ needles or 27G 1½” cannulas (as provided by [CONTACT_78562]) based on the TI’s 
preference to inject VOLBELLA XC su bmuscularly/supraperiostially to correct infraorbital hollowing. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_249746] .

After completion of the Month 12 visit, subjects will be  offered an optional repeat treatment. Alternatively, 
subjects will complete the study after all Month 12 visit procedures are complete. The procedures and 
assessments to be performed at repeat treatment and at follow-up visits after repeat treatment are identical to 
those after the initial treatment, with the exception that no touch-up will be offered. Subjects will be followed for 
1 month after repeat treatment and then exit the study. 
Control group : Subjects randomized to the control group will co mplete a 3-month no-treatment control period 
with office visits at Months 1 and 3. At randomization and at each of these o ffice visits, the following 
assessments will be performed:

STATISTICAL METHODS: 
Sample Size Calculation:  
 
 
 
 
Effectiveness:  The primary effectiveness endpoint is the respon der rate at month [ADDRESS_303592] 1-point improvement from baseline on the AIHS in both 
infraorbital areas based on EI assessment. Baseline is defined as the EI assessment at screening. 
For the primary effectiveness analysis, a 2-sided, Fisher’s exact test at the 5% level will be used to test whether the responder rate at month 3 in the treatment period is significantly greater than th at in the control group at 
month 3 in the control period. 
The secondary effectiveness analyses will include the responder rates with 95% CIs for the treatment group based separately on the EI and subject assessments of GAIS, where a “responder” is a subject who shows 
improvement in the overall aesthetic assessment in the infraorbital area (Improved or Much Improved on GAIS) 
at the Month [ADDRESS_303593] at the 5% level will be used to demonstrate that the mean overall satisfaction score at Month 3 visit is statistically great er than that at baseline for the treatment group. 
The effectiveness analyses will be performed on the modified intent-to-treat population.

 2. Background, Risk and Benefit, and Clinical Rationale 
2.1 Background 
The youthful face is characterized by a fullne ss that is supported by [CONTACT_249765], 
subdermal fat, and skin. Predominant com ponents of the skin—collagen, elastin, and 
glycosaminoglycans, (eg, hyaluronic acid [HA])— lend the skin its strength, elasticity, and 
plumpness. Chronic reduction in any one of thes e components as well as a loss of muscle and 
fat mass contribute to the facial volume loss that  characterizes the aging face. The desire to 
maintain and restore a youthful looking face ha s led to a widespread increase in the number 
of cosmetic procedures being pe rformed. While part of this in crease has been in the area of 
surgical procedures, the largest growth in cosmetic procedures has occurred in the area of 
nonsurgical procedures, includi ng injectable products, such as botulinum toxin, HA, and 
other dermal fillers. 
An early sign of periorbital aging is the development of dark circles under the eyes lending a 
fatigued and aged appearance to the face ( Hirm and 2010 ). An aged appearance is often 
caused by a infraorbital hollowing, which is char acterized as a sunken appearance of the eye 
that results in the casting of a dark shadow over the nasal lower eyelid, giving a fatigued 
appearance despi[INVESTIGATOR_249749], and is refractory to attempts at cosmetic concealment 
(Sadick 2007, Sharad 2012). However, infraorbital hollowing is not exclusively associated 
with age. Mild hollowing has been  observed in younger individuals ( Hirmand 2010, 
Huber -V orlander 2015 ). The presence of infraorbital hollowing in younger subjects without 
pseudoherniated lower lid fat or midface ptosis  could be explained by [CONTACT_249766] ( Kane 2005). 
There are various treatment options for co rrecting the infraorbital volume loss, both 
surgically invasive and noninvasive. The use of  HA dermal fillers to treat infraorbital 
hollowing has an advantage over other filler op tions in that unevenness or overcorrection 
may be addressed with light massage ( Bosniak 2008 ). Lambros (2007) reported a high degree 
of subject satisfaction with the use of HA in the treatment of tear troughs. He also reported 
that most complications were self-limiting and could be treated by [CONTACT_249767]. The largest 
disadvantage of HA in the infraorbital area is its temporary volume augmentation. Although 
treatment can have a long-lasting effect of [ADDRESS_303597] is not permanent 
(Lambros 2 007).

 VOLBELLA® XC, included in the JUVÉDERM range of products, is a malleable gel that 
meets the physical constraints that would be experienced with injection and volume 
expansion. VOLBELLA XC is formulated usi ng a combination of high and low molecular 
weight HA, which reduces the concentration of  crosslinking reagent needed while increasing 
overall crosslinking efficiency. The final formulation includes a small quantity of noncross-
linked HA to decrease extrusion force during inj ection, and lidocaine (0.3% w/w) to increase 
patient comfort. In a postmarketing study, VOLBELLA without Lidocaine (CE marked in 
2007) was demonstrated to be safe and ef fective in providing smooth and natural 
improvement in a variety of f acial aesthetic indi cations (E ccleston 2012), including lip and 
perioral enhancem ent (Philipp-Dormston 2014, Raspaldo 210 5, Raspaldo 2105a, 
Taylor 2016 ). VOLBELLA XC represents an improveme nt with the addition of 0.3% (w/w) 
lidocaine hydrochloride to  reduce procedural pain. 
2.[ADDRESS_303598] as an anaphylactic reaction,  skin rash, redness, 
itching, hives, burning, stinging,  swelling, tenderness, and transient loss of skin color. The 
inclusion of 0.3% lidocaine in the formulation is meant to reduce pain during the injection 
and this should be taken into account when administering concomitant additional anesthetics. Risks associated with treatment to the infrao rbital area include inju ry to the surrounding 
anatomical structures. There are many superficial ar teries of the periorbital area that are distal 
branches of the ophthalmic artery. In addition, th e retinal artery is the proximal branch of the 
ophthalmic artery. Therefore, arte rial occlusion of the retinal artery by [CONTACT_249768] a rare but serious risk in this anatom ic area ( Hirsch 2007 ). 
Several dermal fillers, including VOLBELLA XC, have been clinically evaluated to determine their safety and effectiveness in trea ting infraorbital hollowing. The available data 
suggest that the injection of HA  dermal fillers into the infrao rbital area is a safe procedure 
when administered by [CONTACT_249769]. 
Treatment using VOLBELLA XC as an altern ative to treatment options for correcting 
infraorbital volume loss has many benefits. VOLB ELLA XC is less invasive, has much lower

 rates of infection, has little or  no risk of scarring, has no risk of surgery or general anesthesia, 
and has much shorter recovery times. Furtherm ore, as an HA-based filler, VOLBELLA XC is 
much safer than fat injections or particulate fillers. It is anticipated that the safety and 
effectiveness of treatment to the infraorbital area  are similar to those identified in studies of 
JUVÉDERM products for similar indications. 
2.3 Clinical Rationale 
VOLBELLA XC was designed specifically for vo lumizing and has demonstrated safety and 
effectiveness as a dermal filler for lip and perioral enhancement (Philipp-Dor mston 2014, 
Raspaldo 2105, Raspaldo 2105a, Taylor 2016 ). The protocol is designed as a pi[INVESTIGATOR_249750].

4.3.1 Study Treatment 
VOLBELLA XC injectable gel 
4.3.2 Control Treatment 
No treatment 
4.3.3 Methods for Blinding 
The Evaluating Investigator (EI) and the image analysis technician will be blinded to treatment. The EI will not be present during the injection procedures. As the image files will be accessed by [CONTACT_249770], the image files will not reveal subject 
treatment randomization or the timepoint at which the image was captured. 
The Treating Investigators (TIs), study coordi nators, and subjects will not be blinded to 
treatment, but they will secure the randomiza tion and other records (e g, records of study 
treatments and prior study assessments) from potential discovery by [CONTACT_249771]. The TI 
will not discuss the randomized treatment assignments with or in the presence of the EI. 
4.3.4 Retreatment Criteria 
A touch-up treatment is recommended 30 days afte r the initial treatment (ie, at the Month 1 
follow-up visit)  
 and both the subject and TI 
agree that optimal correction has not been ach ieved. The total injection volume for an 
individual subject for the initial and touch-up treatments combined is not to exceed 2.2 mL 
per side. 
Treatment group subjects will be offered a rep eat treatment after completion of the Month 12 
visit. The total injection volume for repeat treatment is not to exceed 2.2 mL per side.

(or designee), and the designated monitor will verify the data. Investigators will provide 
access to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_249756], medical records, a nd other source documents containing subject 
clinical/medical information. Source document verification will be performed. 
Subjects will complete the ISR diaries elec tronically. Sites will save photographs onto 
supplied electronic media and send the storage de vice to Canfield Scientific. Alternatively, 
files containing the facial digita l photographs may be directly uploaded to Canfield Scientific 
from the Canfield Scientific equipment. 
8. Statistical Procedures 
A separate statistical analysis pl an will be prepared to provide specifications for all analyses. 
The plan will be finalized and approved prior to  clinical database lock. One database lock is 
planned after all subjects exit the study. 
Descriptive statistics will be presented for key outcome measures. Categorical variables will 
be summarized with frequency and relative frequency. Continuous variables will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_249776], mean, median, standard deviation, 1s t and 3rd quartiles, 
minimum, and maximum. Where appropriate,  2-sided 95% CIs for population mean, or 
population proportion, will be provided as part of the descriptive summary. 
Every attempt will be made to collect complete  data and limit the occurrence of missing data. 
Imputation of missing data may be used for sens itivity analysis of the primary effectiveness 
endpoint. Deviations from the analyses planned in the statistical plan will be documented in 
the clinical study report. 
8.1 Analysis Populations 
The following analysis populations will be used in the analyses for this study: 
• modified intent-to-treat (mITT) populati on: subjects who are randomized to study 
treatment (treatment group), receive at least [ADDRESS_303626] 1 follow-up assessment of the primary effectiveness variable 
• safety population: all treated subjects

 Unless specified otherwise, all effectiveness analyses will be performed on the mITT 
population using the “as-randomized” assignm ent for each subject (ie, if a subject 
randomized to the control group is treated in advertently at the start of the study, the 
assessments for that subject will nonetheless be included in the cont rol group analysis). All 
safety analyses will be conducted using the safety population.

8.3 Hypothesis and Methods of Analysis 
8.3.1 Primary Effectiveness Analyses 
For the primary effectiveness analysis, a 2-sided, Fisher’s exact test at the 5% level will be 
used to test whether the responder rate at Month 3 in the tr eatment period is significantly 
greater than that in the control group  at Month 3 in the control period. 
8.3.2 Secondary Effectiveness Analyses 
The following analyses will be performed for each of the secondary effectiveness endpoints: 
• responder rates with 95% CI for the treatment group based separately on the EI and 
subject assessments of GAIS, where a “responder” is a subject who shows 
improvement in the overall aesthetic assessment in the infraorbital area (Improved or 
Much Improved on GAIS) at the Month 3 visit,

Release of Health and Research Study Inform ation, including digital images and other 
written documentation in accordance with th e relevant country and local privacy 
requirements (where applicable) prior to any stud y-related procedures or change in treatment. 
The TI or his/her authorized designee conducts the informed consent (IC) discussion and will 
document in the subject’s medical records the acquisition of IC and th e subject’s agreement 
or refusal to notify his/her primary care physician about the st udy. The IC shall include all 
aspects of the study that are re levant to the subject’s decision to participate throughout the 
study. The IC process is to avoid any coercion or undue influence on, or inducement of, the 
subject to participate. The subject is to pers onally sign and date the ICF. The TI or his/her 
authorized designee will retain the original copy of the signed form, and the subject will 
receive a copy. Upon signing the ICF, the subject is  considered to be enrolled in the study and 
receives a subject number that will be used on all documentation for the subject throughout the study. Subject numbers will be assigned in ascending order, and numbers will not be 
omitted or reused. The subject number is coupled with the study number and site 
identification number for unique id entification of each subject. The TI is to ensure important 
new information is provided to new or existing subjects throughout the study. Arrangements shall be made to inform the subject or legally authorized representative,  as soon as possible, 
about the subject’s inclusion in the study and about all aspects of  the study. The subject shall 
be asked to provide IC for continued participation as soon as his/her medical condition allows. 
10.1.3 Method for Assignment to Treatment Groups

 situation and take appropriate action after consultation. Conditions that may warrant 
termination of the study or site include, but are not limited to: 
• the discovery of an unexpected, serious, or unacceptable risk to subjects enrolled in 
the study 
• the decision on the part of Allergan to susp end or discontinue test ing, evaluation, or 
development of the study device 
• failure of the TI to comply with pertinent national or state regulations, IRB-imposed 
conditions, or prot ocol requirements 
• TI submission of knowingly false informati on to Allergan, a study monitor, the IRB, 
or any regulatory agency 
• If a vascular embolic AE leading to skin necrosis, vision loss, or  stroke occurs, all 
treatments at the investigational site will be suspended while the circumstances of the 
event are investigated. If the event is confirmed to be a vascular embolic event and related to VOLBELLA XC treatment, Allergan will suspend any further enrollment and treatments at the investigational site while performing a root cause analysis. If the AE is a result of deviation from the inj ection procedure, the investigator may be 
retrained and allowed to con tinue enrolling subjects. If the event is not a result of 
deviation from the injection procedure, all enrollment and treatments at all investigational sites will be  halted until the event can be characterized, and a strategy 
to avoid further AEs can be developed. 
Per International Organization for Standardizat ion (ISO) [ZIP_CODE], if a study is prematurely 
terminated or suspended due to safety issues, Allergan shall inform all Investigators and the 
regulatory authorities of the termination or su spension and the reason(s)  for the termination 
or suspension. The IRB is also to be inform ed promptly and provided the reason(s) for the 
termination or suspension by [CONTACT_249781] e Investigator, as specified by [CONTACT_11005]. If a premature termination or suspension occurs, Allergan shall 
remain responsible for providing resources to fulfill the protocol obligations and existing 
agreements for follow-up of subjects enrolled  in the study, and each investigator or 
authorized designee shall promptly inform enrolled subjects, if applicable. 
11. Adverse Events 
Throughout the course of the study, all AEs will be monitored and reported on an AE eCRF, including seriousness, severity, action taken and relationship to study treatment. If AEs occur, 
the first concern will be the sa fety of the study participants.

itching at the treatment site. Additional info rmation about the possible side effects is 
available in the IDFU for VOLBELLA XC. 
11.1 Definitions 
11.1.1 Adverse Event 
An AE is defined in accordance with ISO [ZIP_CODE] as “any untoward medical occurrence, 
unintended disease or injury, or untoward clinical signs (including abnormal laboratory 
findings) in subjects, users, or other persons, whether or not related to the investigational 
medical device.” This definition includes events related to the investigational medical device 
or comparator and events related to the pro cedures involved except for events in users or 
other persons, which only incl ude events related to invest igational medical devices. 
Disease signs and symptoms that existed prior to the study treatment are not considered AEs 
unless the condition recurs after the subject has recovered from  the pre-existing condition or 
the condition worsens in intensity or frequency during the study. 
AEs will be monitored throughout the study begi nning with signing of the ICF. At each 
postscreening visit, the TI (or designee) will begin querying for AEs by [CONTACT_249782] a 
general, non-directed questions, “Have you had any changes to your condition since your last 
visit?” Previous AEs and changes in therapy/ concomitant medications are to be updated. 
Directed questioning and examination will then  be done as appropriate. All reportable AEs 
and clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings will be documented on the appropriate 
eCRF. 
The following is a list of known potential AEs, including those related to visual symptoms: 
• Redness, swelling, or a rash, which may be a ssociated with itching, pain on pressure, 
after the injection 
• Pain at injection site

 • Bruising 
• Nodules or “lumpi[INVESTIGATOR_008]” at the injection site 
• Discoloration of the injection site 
• Rare cases of allergy, severe sensitivity, localized inflammation and abscesses 
• Very occasionally, delayed side effects can  occur many months after the treatment. 
These side effects may appear as red lumps showing up underneath the skin, or 
intermittent epi[INVESTIGATOR_249758]. 
• In rare circumstances, facial fillers have  been injected into blood vessels causing 
blockage and embolization which can result in skin necrosis, ulceration, or vision 
changes. Risks to vision include complete blindness, partial bli ndness, blurred vision, 
double vision, loss of peripheral vision, loss of a portion of the visual field or anterior 
segment ischemia (characterized by [CONTACT_249783]). These effects can be 
temporary or permanent but are rare. 
• Swelling or edema around the eye following an  injection can result in a temporary 
decrease of vision. 
• In rare circumstances, facial fillers have been associated with granulomas, which are 
small inflammatory nodules under the skin. 
Unforeseeable risks or results are also a po ssibility. The risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a serious 
complication is small. If a complication occurs , subjects will be advised to contact [CONTACT_249784]/her medical judgment to do whatev er is necessary to treat the subject. In the 
event of visual disturbance, the subject must also be referred to a retinal specialist for 
evaluation and for appropriate care. 
11.1.[ADDRESS_303637] (AESI) is defined as any vision-related AE. See Section 11.3 for 
procedures for reporting an AESI. 
11.1.3 Serious Adverse Event 
An SAE is defined in accordance with ISO [ZIP_CODE] as an AE that: 
a) led to death, 
b) led to serious deterioration in the health of the subject, that either resulted in 
1. a life-threatening illness or injury, or 
2. a permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function, or 
3. in-patient or prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or

 4. medical or surgical intervention to prevent life-threatening illness or 
injury or permanent impairment to a body structure or a body function 
c) led to fetal distress, fetal death or a congenital abnormality or birth defect 
NOTE: Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a pre-existing condition, or  a procedure required by [CONTACT_12695], without serious deterioration in health, is not  considered an SAE. Allergan 
considers all cancer AEs as SAEs. Abortion is also considered an SAE except for elective 
abortion of a normal fetus. 
See Section 11.4 for procedures for reporting an SAE/serious adverse device effect (SADE). 
11.1.[ADDRESS_303638] (ADE) is defined in accordance with ISO [ZIP_CODE] as “an adverse 
event related to the use of an investigational medical device.”  This definition includes any 
adverse events resulting from insufficient or inadequate instructions for use, deployment, 
implantation, installation, or operation, or any malfunction of the investigational medical 
device as well as any event resulting from use error (per ISO [ZIP_CODE]) or from intentional 
misuse of the investigational medical device. 
See Section 11.[ADDRESS_303639] (SADE) is  defined in accordance with ISO [ZIP_CODE] as “an 
adverse device effect that has resulted in any of the consequences characteristic of a serious 
adverse event.” See Section 11.[ADDRESS_303640] (UADE) is defined in accordance with 21 CFR 812.3 
as “any serious adverse effect on health or sa fety or any life-threa tening problem or death 
caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of inci dence in the investigational plan or application 
(including a supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem 
associated with a device that relates to th e rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.”

 11.1.7 Device Deficiency 
A device deficiency is defined in accordance with ISO [ZIP_CODE] as “inadequacy of a medical 
device with respect to its identity, quality, dur ability, reliability, sa fety, or performance.” 
Device deficiencies include malfunctions, use errors, and inadequate labeling. 
If a device deficiency occurs, the TI will not ify Allergan using the fax number or email on 
the front page of the protocol. Device defi ciencies shall be documented throughout the study 
and appropriately managed by [CONTACT_78562]. Allergan  shall review all device deficiencies and 
determine and document in writing whether they  could have led to a SADE. These shall be 
reported to the regulatory au thorities and IRBs as required by [CONTACT_2091]. 
11.1.8 Severity 
Severity is a clinical determination of the intensity of an adverse event. The severity 
assessment for a clinical adverse event is to be completed using the following definitions as 
guidelines: 
Mild Awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated 
Moderate Discomfort affecting daily activity 
Severe Disabling with inability to do usual daily activities 
11.1.9 Relationship to Treatment 
Relationship to a treatment refers to a determin ation of the relationship (if any) between an 
AE and the device or treatment procedure. A causal relationship is present if the TI 
determines that there is a reasonable possibili ty that the AE may have been caused by [CONTACT_249785], such  as an event that can be attributed to other 
products, surgical techniques, or medications  required specifically for the procedure. 
Relationship to the treatment must be determined by [CONTACT_249786].

Study Design  
 The proposed study is a Phase II, open label study to evaluate the safety and 
antiretroviral activity of two and four infusions of 3BNC117 in HIV -infected 
subjects on combination ART during a brief analytical treatment interruption 
(Figure 1 , Study design). PK assessments are also included.  
 
The subject’s viral sensitivity to 3BNC117 will be tested by [CONTACT_859861]’s virus followed by a TZM -bl assay as previously described ( Trkola et al., 
2005a ) (Mehandru et al., 2007a ). After meeting enrollment criteria sixteen 
subjects with 3BNC117 sensitive virus (< 2µg/ml IC 50) will receive two (Group A) 
or four (Group B) intravenous infusions  of 3BNC117, administered at 30 mg/kg as 
shown below (Figure 1)   
 
Enrollment in Group B will start with a mini cohort of three subjects. The se [ADDRESS_1198396], the Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) 
will review all available safety data .  The SMC will then provide a 
recommendation regarding administration of a third dose.  If the SMC determines 
it is safe to proceed , the third dose will be administered [ADDRESS_1198397] 3BNC117 infusion (day 2)  until week 12.  ART regimen will be resumed 
sooner if plasma HIV -1 RNA level is ≥  200 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/ml or if CD4+ count drops < 
350 cells/ µl and either result is confirmed upon repeat measurement  during  the 
next weekly scheduled visit. If plasma HIV -1 RNA level  is ≥ 1,000 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/ml, the 
participant will be aske d to return for a repeat measurement prior to the next 
scheduled visit , and ART will be resumed if results are confirmed.  ART will also 
be resumed early if the participant  becomes pregnant,  or if otherwise clinic ally 
indicated. If ART regimen is resumed before  completion of  3BNC117 infusions , 
further  3BNC117 infusion s will not be performed.  
 
All subjects will be followed weekly until week 12 for safety assessments and for 
monitoring plasma HIV -1 RNA levels. CD4+ T  cell counts will be monitored 
every 2 weeks until week 12. After week 12 subjects will be followed as outlined in the Time of Events Schedule (Appendix A).  
Subjects will be offered a 
continuation of the treatment interruption through week 36  in conjunctio n with 
their primary care physician as long as viral rebound does not occur  (Extension

CONFIDENTIAL  8 Phase) . In the extension phase of the study , subjects will return for follow up 
every week , while off ART . ART resumption will follow same criteria as detailed 
above . 
 
Safety and PK assessments will be performed at multiple time po ints following 
3BNC117 infusions  (see Appendix A). Subjects will be followed for 36 weeks 
from enrollment.

Study Duration  [ADDRESS_1198398] of two and four 
infusions  of 3BNC117 at 30 mg/kg in delaying virologic rebound and 
maintaining viral suppression during a short analytical treatment interruption; 
and to evaluate its safety , tolerability and pharmacokinetic profile in HIV -
infected subjects with suppressed viremia during a  short  analytical treatment 
interruption . 
- The secondary objective  is to determine the range of 3BNC117 serum levels 
at which virologic rebound occurs  and to compare the effect of two and four 
infusions of 3BNC117 at 30 mg/kg in  delaying virologic rebound  and 
maintaining viral suppression during a short analytical treatment interruption . 
- Exploratory objectives are to phylogenetically compare viruses grown from 
PBMCs collected from subjects while on ART to rebound viruses collected 
after treatment interruption and analyze the induction of  escape mutations  that 
might arise after administration of 3BNC117 . Further more , we plan to  
evaluate HIV -[ADDRESS_1198399] of 3BNC117 on cell associated 
HIV DNA and RNA.

day 0 , day 14, day 28 and day 42.   
 Dose level to be tested: 30 mg/kg.  
 
Statistical 
Methodology  In this study “occurrence of rebound during treatment interruption” and “time 
from treatment interruption until rebound occurs” are response variables.  A one sided less Binomial Test with Clopper -
Pearson confidence interval at 95% for 
proportion of reboun d will allow us to determine the population probability for the 
first variable, “occurrence of rebound”, with 95% of statistical significance level. 
As such, a sample size of [ADDRESS_1198408] the 
null hypothesis (p(rebound)=1) with at least 8 0% power for any effect size of 
0.18, which means the null hypothesis will be rejected with desired power, if at 
least 4 out of 8  subjects enrolled in study group B do not rebound by [CONTACT_5875] 8  ([ADDRESS_1198409] 3BNC117 infusion) . If 5 or more participants in group B  
experience viral rebound prior to study week  6 [[ADDRESS_1198410] 3BNC117 
infusion], additional participants will not undergo ATI . 
 
 Kaplan -Meier survival curves will be used to address the second variable, “time 
to rebound”.  
 
The number and percentage of subjects experiencing one or more AEs will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_8792], and severity. AEs will also be 
summarized by [CONTACT_859865] . The CTCAE v4.03 grading scale will be used for 
reporting and grading adverse events related to infusion reactions and cytokine 
release syndromes (Appendix B). Changes will be calculated relative to the values 
collected at baseline.  
 
Pharmacokinetic parameters will be calculated using standard non -compartmental 
analysis methods. The time to rebound and the concentration of 3BNC117 at the 
time of rebound will be determined and summarized using confidence intervals.  
 A 95% repeated measures ANO VA F -test will be used to compare the following 
variables, before the first infusion and at [ADDRESS_1198411] infusion if viral 
rebound does not occur :
 
• levels of plasma HIV -1 RNA by [CONTACT_245142];  
• levels of cell -associated HIV -1 RNA  and DNA;

Despi[INVESTIGATOR_859839] (ART) in suppressing 
viral replication and preventing disease progression, HIV -[ADDRESS_1198418]. 
Nussenzweig’s laboratory. In preclinical studies carried out in humanized mice and non-human primates, 3BNC117 alone or in combination with other neutralizing antibodies led to protection from HIV or chimeric simian/human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) infection, and also to sustained suppression of HIV plasma viremia. Moreover, 3BNC117 alone prevented rebound of viral load after ART was discontinued in humanized mice. The aims of this protocol are to evaluate the effect  of two and four infusions  of 3BNC117 
at 30 mg/kg in delaying virologic rebound and maintaining viral suppression during a 
short analytical treatment interruption. In addition, the study will evaluate the safety of 
3BNC117 infusions during a brief analytical ART interruption.  
  
[ADDRESS_1198419] HIV -1 remains elusive, and there are no 
vaccine candidates approaching licensure.   Despi[INVESTIGATOR_859840] (ART) in suppressing 
viral replication and preventing disease progression, HIV -[ADDRESS_1198420] subjects  (Davey et al., 1999)  (Strategies for 
Management of Antiretroviral Therapy Study et al., 2006) . Even in the context of 
suppressive ART, HIV infection is character ized by [CONTACT_859866] -1 viremia 
and immune activation and cell- associated HIV -1 remain relatively stable  (Deeks et al., 
2013) . Studies have shown that intensified antiretroviral regimens do not affect low level 
viremia and do not result in lower levels of HIV -1 persistence  (Markowitz et al., 2014; 
McMahon et al., 2010) . Therefore, additional HIV treatment modalities are required.  
   A fraction  of HIV -infected individuals (10 – 30%) mount a serologic response that can 
neutralize a broad spectrum of HIV -1 isolates (Simek et al., 2009) . Although broadly 
neutralizing antibodies that arise during HIV infection fail to resolve established infection, the selection of resistant strains indicates that bNAbs exert selective pressure on the virus. Importantly, several different groups of investigators have shown that 
macaque  chimeric simian/human immunodeficiency virus ( SHIV) infection can be 
prevented by [CONTACT_775806] -HIV-1 monoclonal antibodies, 
(Shingai et al., 2013) . Broadly neutralizing antibodies might also play a role in the 
treatment of HIV infection.

Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) differ from other therapeutic modalities for HIV in several respects. First, they can neutralize the pathogen directly; second, they have the potential to clear the virus and infected cells th rough engagement of innate effector 
responses; and third, immune complexes produced by [CONTACT_859867] e response to HIV. In fact, recent data show that a subset of 
bNAbs may inhibit cell- to-cell transmission of HI V at very low concentrations ( Malbec 
et al., 2013) . Experiments in humanized mice and non- human primate s indicate that 
combinations of bNAbs can lead to rapid virological suppression that is sustained for as long as mAb levels are maintained above a certain threshold (Barouch et al., 2013) .  
 In SHIV -infected nonhuman primates 3BNC117 induces rapid viral suppression as 
monotherapy (7). Also, 3BNC117 monotherapy is able to prevent infection in macaques 
challenged with SHIV
AD8EO  or SHIV DH12 -V3AD8 more effectively than the previously 
described antibody VRC01( 10). While antibody monotherapy did not control HIV -1 
infection in viremic, untreated hu -mice, a single neutralizing antibody, i.e.  3BNC117, 
was able to sustain  undetectable viral loads  after initial suppress ion by [CONTACT_356530] . Whereas hu-mice that received ART normally rebounded immediately after the 
drugs were terminated, continuing a single antibody was sufficient to maintain control after ART interruption in 50- 86% of the hu- mice, for as long as  antibody concentrations 
remained therapeutic (Horwitz et al., 2013) . Mice that escaped 3BNC117 carried 
resistance mutations in the CD4bs at positions YU2
(279-281) or YU2(458/459). In contrast, 
viruses that emerged after immunotherapy was terminated did not contain antibody 
resistance mutations and remained sensitive to neutralization by [CONTACT_340125] y.  
 
The SMART randomized trial demonstrated t hat epi[INVESTIGATOR_775778], guided by [CONTACT_775810]4+ 
count (ART reinitiated if CD4+ count < 250 cells/ µl), leads to increased risk of 
opportunistic infections or death from any cause, as compared with continuous ART, 
during a median follow -up time of 16 months ( Strategies for Management of 
Antiretroviral Therapy Study et al., 2006 ). While structured treatment interruptions 
(STIs) have traditionally been avoided given safety concerns, it should be noted that, in 
the first 16 weeks following randomization into the SMART study, there were no deaths 
in either treatment group – those that received continuous ART or t hose that received 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_859841]4 count.  In addition, the differences in risk of opportunistic 
diseases and major cardiovascular, renal, and hepatic diseases between the two groups occurred predominantly after 16 weeks, increased over time and  were strongly associated 
with low CD4 counts as well as increased viral loads. Recent evidence suggests that short 
analytical treatment interruption (limited to a maximum of 16 weeks),  in individuals with 
preserved CD4 count and virologic suppression, is safe and is an accepted tool to 
evaluate new therapeutic modalities (Kutzler and Jacobson, 2008) .  
 Passive administration of less potent, first generation  anti-HIV-1 bNAbs has been 
evaluated in ART -interruption settings in humans. In these studies, 13- 16 antibod y 
infusions  were administered intravenously at doses ranging from 0.5 to 2 g and were 
generally found to be safe and well  tolerated. Furthermore, one of the antibodies (2G12) 
seemed to delay  viral rebound in several participants. T his effect was rather limited , as

CONFIDENTIAL  16 2G12 did not neutralize the donor’s virus  isolates  with sufficient potency (Trkola et al., 
2005a ) (Mehandru et al., 2007a ). However, both st udies found some correlation between 
the baseline sensitivity of the subject’s virus to the antibody 2G12 and this antibody’s 
ability to delay viral rebound. Therefore, we will test for the sensitivity of the subject’s virus to 3BNC117 before the screening  visit (under protocol MCA -823). Based on 
previous data ( Scheid et al., 2011)  sensitivity to 3BNC117 will be defined by [CONTACT_699891]
50 titer 
< 2µg/ml. The sensitivity testing will be repeated on  day 0 , after 3BNC117 infusions , and 
after viral rebound. It  will be performed as previously described ( Trkola et al., 2005a ) 
(Mehandru et al., 2007a ) (Laird et al., 2013)  by [CONTACT_859868]’s virus at the 
Laboratory of Molecular Immunology, followed by a TZM -bl assay in the laboratory of 
[CONTACT_859903] .  
 Since highly potent second generation bNAbs have not been evaluated before in the 
setting of ART -interruption in humans, it is not k nown which serum antibody levels will 
be required to prevent viral rebound. In humanized mice, levels of 3BNC117 decreased to levels as low as 0.5 
µg/ml (10 times the IC 50 value for the HIV strain used) before viral 
rebound occurred during ART -interruption (Horwitz  et al., 2013). In the setting of 
antibody monotherapy in macaques , 3BNC117 serum levels above 1- 10µg/ml (10-100 
times the IC 50 value for the respective strain ) were required to prevent rebound (Shingai 
et al., 2013) . Based on the PK data from the  first clinical trial with 3BNC117 , MCA -835 
(Caskey  et al., 2015)  we designed the first group of this trial, Group A , to maintain 
3BNC117 serum levels above 50 µg/ml (25 times the IC 50 value of the respective patient 
virus) for at least 5 weeks after starting ATI. This allow s us to investigate the ability of 
3BNC117 to prevent viral rebound beyond the period of 2- 3 weeks, during which 
rebound usually occurs in the setting of ATI  (Davey et al., 1999; SMART Study et al., 
2006; Rothenberger e t al., 2015) .  
 Eight subjects have enrolled in this protocol  to date (Group A) . Preliminary results show 
that the administration of 3BNC117 at 30mg/kg in the setting of an ATI is safe. Most reported adverse events  were transient and considered of grade [ADDRESS_1198421] received the second 3BNC117 infusion (MCA867- 701, -702, -703, -704, -
706, -707, -708). Viral re bound has occurred in all seven  participan ts; it occurred at week 
9 in participants MCA867- 707 and - 708, at week 6 in participants MCA867- 701 and -
704, at week 5 in participants - 702 and - 703, and at week 4 in participant - 706 (of note, 
this participant’s viral load was 50 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/ml at day 0). ART reinitiation led to rapid 
decrease in viral loads in all  particip ants with measurements after ART reinitiation . 
Compared to historic controls who did not receive antibody treatment and showed viral 
rebound after 2- 3 weeks after ART interruptio n, two infusions of 3BNC117 appear  to 
delay viral rebound (Davey et al., 1999;  SMART Study et al., 2006, Rothenberger et al., 
2015).

According to preliminary results in Group A of MCA -867, serum levels of 3BNC117 can 
decrease to levels as low as 66 μ g/ml at week 5  (Figure 2 ). Experiments in mice and 
macaques  suggest that antibody levels  10-[ADDRESS_1198422] infecting  viral 
strains  are necessary to control viral rebound. 3BNC117 levels  achieved with Group A ’s 
dosing regimen, therefore , might only be sufficient to suppress viremia up to week 5. 
This might explain why viral rebound occurred at [ADDRESS_1198423] if viral suppression can be further prolonged by  3BNC117 alone, we 
propose  an amendment to  this protocol to modify  and optimize  the dosing regimen. 
Enrollment in Group A will be closed. Additional participants will enroll in a new study

3BNC117 is a broadly neutralizing and highly potent anti -HIV-1 antibody. 3BNC117 
was initially cloned from one B cell isolated from a volunteer infected with HIV -1 clade 
B, who controls his HIV -1 infection without antiretroviral therapy. The initial study was 
conducted under protocol MNU -0628. 3BNC117 targets the CD4 binding site (CD4bs) 
within HIV -1 envelope gp- 120. It showed an average IC 80 on a combined group of 95 tier 
2 viruses of 1.4 µg/ml when evaluated by [CONTACT_859869]  (Scheid et al., 
2011) . 3BNC117 also showed in vivo  activity in experiments in both humanized mice and 
non-human primates. In chronically infected animals, passive administration of 
3BNC117 alone or in combination with other potent neutralizing antibodies suppressed 
plasma viremia to levels below detection ( Shingai et al., 2013)  (Barouch et al., 2013 ). 
Moreover, 3BNC117 administration protected both humanized mice ( Gruell et al., 2013)  
and rhesus macaques ( Shingai et al., 2013)  from challenge with HIV -1 and tier 2 SHIVs, 
respectively.   
 3BNC117 has been manufactured for clinical use under cGMP by [CONTACT_775797].   The manufacture of the recombinant human monoclonal 3BNC117 was carried out by [CONTACT_859870] -free CHO cell culture. 3BNC117 was manufactured as a sterile solution 
intended for parenteral use, in compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP). No animal -derived raw materials were used during the cell culture, purification, and 
formulation of the drug substance. The drug substance was manufactured in a dedicated 
suite utilizing single -use equipment (e.g., WAVE bioreactor) to minimize potential for 
product cross contamination. A low pH step and a nanofiltration step were used for vi rus 
inactivation and reduction. Viral clearance studies used the model viruses PPV and A -
MuLV. Testing for adventitious agents was performed in accordance to FDA Points to Consider in the Manufacture and Testing of Monoclonal Antibody Products for Human Use (1997). An ongoing drug product stability testing program monitors the quality of 
3BNC117 over the duration of the clinical dosing period. Stability is evaluated in real 
time at the recommended storage conditions of 5 ± 3°C as well as at accelerated temp erature conditions of 25 ± 2°C / 60 ± 5% RH.  
 Clinical Safety of Other anti- HIV Monoclonal Antibodies.  
Monoclonal antibodies are a growing part of our therapeutic arsenal. While each mAb product has unique safety issues related to its mechanism of action, the major safety 
concern related to mAbs in general is infusion/hypersensitivity reactions, which are more common for mAbs that contain murine elements. 3BNC117 is a fully human recombinant form of a naturally existing human mAb. Passive administration of  antibodies is 
successfully used to prevent or treat several viral diseases and several monoclonal 
antibodies are being developed for use in either prevention or treatment of infectious 
diseases.

PROTOCOL # MCA -0867 
CONFIDENTIAL  19 Passive administration of anti- HIV-1 antibodies has also be en evaluated in humans. HIV 
Immune Globulin (HIVIG) was in clinical use in the 1990s before the advent of highly 
effective ART. HIVIG was also evaluated in HIV -infected pregnant females and their 
newborns in a phase III trial to assess whether HIVIG plus s ingle dose nevirapi[INVESTIGATOR_859842]. While there was no demonstrable 
difference in treatment efficacy, the study showed that tha t there were no significant 
differences in mortality or serious AEs between the two arms of the trial ( Onyango -
Makumbi et al., 2011 ). 
 
Several monoclonal antibodies that target HIV -[ADDRESS_1198426] been evaluated in clinical studies. 
For example, 2F5 and 4E10 are IgG1 (kappa) monoclonal antibodies that target the 
membrane- proximal ectodomain of gp41, while 2G12 binds to a carbohydrate moiety on 
the silen t face of gp 120. These neutralizing antibodies were evaluated in combination in 
HIV-infected individuals (Armbruster et al., 2004 ). The antibodies were administered 
intravenously at 0.5 to 1 g doses; [ADDRESS_1198427] 2G12 was found in two 
subjects.  
 
Two other studies included HIV -infected subjects on combination ART and plasma vira l 
levels < 50 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/ml ( Trkola et al., 2005a )n = 14 ); (Mehandru et al., 2007a )n =10). The 
antibodies were administered intravenously at doses ranging from 1 to 2 g for each 
antibody; 13- [ADDRESS_1198428] subjects; mild 
and tr ansient side effects were reported only occasionally. No serious adverse events 
(SAEs) were recorded. In both studies, the use of mAbs was safe and generally delayed, 
but did not prevent viral rebound. The emergence of resistance to 2G12, however,  
demonstr ated that the antibody exerted selective pressure on the circulating viral strains. 
Also, the delay of viral rebound correlated positively with the baseline sensitivity of the 
participants’ virus isolate. It is important to note that the antibodies used in these studies 
have far lower potency and breadth than the more recently isolated neutralizing antibodies, such as 3BNC117. Moreover, in contrast to 3BNC117, these antibodies had 
very limited effect in the  treatment of HIV in humanized mice (
Poignard et al., 1999) . 
 
3.1.3 Preclinical Toxicity Studies with 3BNC117  
A tissue cross- reactivity study, performed on a full panel of tissues from humans and rats, 
showed good concordance of binding between the two species. While 3BNC117 showed 
widespread cytoplasmic binding, it is generally understood that cytoplasmic binding is  
considered of little to no toxicologic significance.  Membrane binding of 3BNC117 was restricted to two limited/rare cell types in conjunctival recesses and in the urinary bladder (neither of which correlated with findings in the repeat dose toxicology st udy).  
 The antibody 3BNC117 was evaluated for safety in a multidose study in rats. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_859843] -drug antibodies, the rats appeared to have maintained 
adequate drug exposure in the study, with twice per week dosing for four weeks. Aside

PROTOCOL # MCA -0867 
CONFIDENTIAL  20 from  injection site findings, there were no 3BNC117 related effects, in the Main and 
Recovery group animals, on clinical observations, body weight, food consumption, body 
temperature, clinical pathology parameters, organ weights or macroscopic and microscopic observations, and the NOEL (no observable effect level) was determined to 
be the high dose of 60 mg/kg twice a week for four weeks.  
 
3.1.4 Clinical Experience with 3BNC117  
3BNC117 is currently being evaluated in a phase 1 study in both HIV -uninfected and 
HIV-infected subjects (protocol MCA -835). Study subjects are administered one or two 
intravenous infusions of 3BNC117 at increasing dose levels (1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg 
or 30 mg/kg), and are followed for [ADDRESS_1198429] infusion. As of 13 September 
2015, 55 subjects ( 22 HIV-uninfected, 19  viremic HIV -infected and 14  ART -treated  
HIV-infected individuals) have enrolled in the study. F ive HIV-uninfected individuals 
have received two infusions of 3BNC117 at 30mg/kg, 12 weeks apart. Twenty -three  
subjects (3 HIV -uninfected and 19 HIV-infected) have been administered one dose of 30 
mg/kg.  
 Overall, 3BNC117 has been generally safe and well -tolerated , mild  transient myalgia , 
fatigue and headache have occurred. Some participants  reported ophthalmic complaints, 
but a causal relationship with 3BNC117 was not established. No SAEs or grade 3/[ADDRESS_1198430] occurred. A safety data summary  is included in the 
Investigator’s Brochure ( IB). 
 Preliminary PK data show that 3BNC117’s half -life is 17.6 days in HIV -uninfected  and 
9.6 days in viremic HIV -infected individuals . Peak serum concentration of 3BNC117 is 
reached at the end of infusion with a mean concentration of 563.6 µ g/ml (range 410.2 – 
976.4 µg/ml) after  a single 30 mg/kg infusion in HIV -infected individuals. In these 
individuals, 3BNC117 serum  levels range from 13 to 65 µ g/ml (mean 41.6 +/ - 12.5 
µg/ml) three weeks after infusion.  In addition, 3BNC117 decay rates  following first and 
second 10 mg/kg infusions in HIV -uninfected individuals  are similar.  
 A transient decline in HIV -1 viremia, of approximately 0.5 log, occurred following the 
administration of 3mg/kg of 3BNC117 to three HIV -infected subjects with detectable 
viremia. Of the 3  individuals receiving the 10mg/kg dose of antibody, only 2 responded 
with a decrease in viremia of 0.69 and 1.36 log
10. The individual that did not respond was 
infected with 3BNC117- resistant virus that (2C4; IC 50 > 20µg/ml at baseline). All ten  
viremic  individuals that received the 30mg/kg dose of 3BNC117 showed rapid decreases 
in their viral loads that varied between individuals from 0.8 to 2.5 log 10. The median time 
to reach the nadir in viremia was 7 days, but could be as long as 21 days.  Interestingly , 
emergence of resistant viral strains was variable, with some individuals remaining sensitive to 3BNC117 for a period of 28 days after infusion (Caskey et al. , 2015) . 
Virologic data will continue to be analyzed under protocol MCA -835, as additional HIV -
infected subjects are enrolled.  
 
In addition, seven  of the eight  subjects enrolled in this  study (protocol MCA -867) have 
received  two 3BNC117 infusions at 30mg/kg at day s [ADDRESS_1198431]’s baseline 
The Rockefeller University    IND: 118225/ 0016 
September 21, 2015    
PROTOCOL # MCA -0867 
CONFIDENTIAL  21 (day 0) HIV -1 viral load was found to be  8,730 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/ml  (subject -705).  The subject 
was withdrawn from active study (second 3BNC117 dose was not administered), 
however he continues to be followed for safety as he received the first 3BNC117 dose. Most reported adverse events were transient and considered of grade 1 severity. Participants did not report symptoms consistent with acute retroviral syndrome . 
3BNC117’s  peak mean serum concentration was 578.6 µg/ml (range 383.6 – 823.8  
µg/ml) after first infusion and 613.4 µg/ml (range 456 – 757.6 µg/ml) after second 
infusion. The decay rate appears  similar after first and second infusions, although follow 
up data is still being generated. 3BNC117 levels decreased to levels as lo w as 66  μg/ml at 
week 5  (66 – 123 µg/ml), two  weeks after the second infusion.  Seven  participants 
enrolled ( -701, -702, -703, -704, -706, -707, -708) experienced viral rebound at week 4 to 
9 (Figure 2 ). ART was reinitiated in all subjects and has led to rapid decrease in viral 
loads in all cases .  
 
3.2 Hypothesis   
 
The administration of two  or four infusions  of 3BNC117 (30 mg/kg) will be safe, well 
tolerated, and will delay the return of HIV -1 viremia during a brief analytical treatment 
interruption.

4 Study Design  
The proposed study is a Phase I I, open label study to evaluate the safety and antiretroviral 
activity of two and four infusions of 3BNC117 in HIV -infected su bjects on combination 
ART during a brief analytical treatment interruption ( Figure 3, Study design). PK 
assessments are also included.   
 The subject’s viral sensitivity to 3BNC117 will be tested by [CONTACT_859871]’s virus at the Laboratory of Molecular Immunology, followed by a TZM -bl assay in the 
laboratory of [CONTACT_859903] as previously described ( Trkola et al., 2005a ) 
(Mehandru et al., 2007a ) (Laird et al., 2013) . The initial testing will be performed under 
the protocol MCA -823. Based on previous data ( Scheid et al., 2011)  sensitivity  to 
3BNC117 will be defined by [CONTACT_699891]
50 titer <  2µg/ml.  
 
After meeting enrollment criteria , eight  subjects wi th 3BNC117 sensitive virus (<  2µg/ml 
IC50) enrolled in Group A  to receive two intravenous infusions  of 3BNC117, 
administered at 30 mg/kg on day 0 and day 21. Eight additional subjects with 3BNC117 
sensitive virus (<  2µg/ml IC 50) will receive four  intravenous infusions  of 3BNC117, 
administered at 30 mg/kg on day 0, day 14, day 28 and day 42 (Group B).  
 
As 3BNC117 has not been administered four time s to single individuals to date, Group B 
will be started with a mini cohort (n=3). The SMC will review all available safety data up 
to day 21 (1 week after second infusion) of the first [ADDRESS_1198435] dose.  If the

PROTOCOL # MCA -[ADDRESS_1198436] dose will be administered 2 weeks 
following the second dose (day 28) and the fourth dose will follow two weeks lat er (day 
42). Two weeks after the third subject in Group B receives the fourth dose, all available safety data will be reviewed by [CONTACT_4484].  If the SMC determines it is safe to proceed, additional subjects  (n = 5)  will be enrolled to receive [ADDRESS_1198437] that  3BNC117 serum levels will be 
maintained  above 70 µg/ml for at least 8 weeks in Group B  (Caskey et al., 2015) . This 
significantly  exceeds the typi[INVESTIGATOR_859844] , which ranges from 2- [ADDRESS_1198438] 3BNC117 infusion ( day

other antiretroviral classes. They are typi[INVESTIGATOR_859845] [ADDRESS_1198439]’s ART regimen includes an NNRTI, the NNRTI will be switched to 
dolutegravir  (an integrase inhibitor) 4 weeks prior discontinuing all antiretroviral drugs . 
Dolutegravir will be provided to the subjec ts for that time period.  
 The original  ART regimen will be resumed at week 12.  The ART regimen will be 
resumed sooner if plasma HIV -1 RNA level is ≥  200 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/ml or if CD4+ count drops < 
350 cells/ µl and either result  is confirmed upon repeat measurement  during  the next 
weekly scheduled visit . If plasma HIV -1 RNA level  is ≥ 1,000 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/ml, the participant 
will be asked to return for a repeat measurement prior to the next scheduled visit, and ART will be resumed if results are confirmed.  ART will also be r esumed early if the 
participant  becomes pregnant , or if otherwise clinically indicated . If ART regimen is 
resumed before completion of all  3BNC117 infusions, further 3BNC117 infusions  will 
not be performed.  
 All subjects will be followed weekly until week 12 for safety assessments and for monitoring plasma HIV -1 RNA levels. CD4+ T cell counts will be monitored every 2 
weeks until week 12. After week 12 subjects will be followed as outlined in the Time of 
Events Schedule (Appendix A).  
 Subjects will be offer ed a continuation of the treatment interruption through week 36, 
coordinated wi th their primary care physician as long as viral rebound does not occur . In 
the extension phase of the study subjects will return for follow up every week, while off 
ART . ART re sumption will follow same criteria as detailed above.  After ART is 
resumed, study subjects will return for follow up according to the Main Schedule (i.e. wk 
14, 24 and 36) (Appendix A).  Safety and PK assessments will be performed at multiple time points f ollowing 3BNC117 
infusions  (see Appendix A). Subjects will be followed for 36 weeks from enrollment.

8 Data Analysis  
 8.1 Design  
The proposed study is a Phase I I, open label study to evaluate the a ntiretroviral activity 
and safety of two  and four  3BNC117 infusions  in HIV -infected subjects on combination 
antiretroviral therapy, during a brief analytical treatment interruption. The study will also obtain additional data on its pharmacokinetic profile.   
After meeting enrollment criteria eight  subjects with 3BNC117 sensitive virus (<  2µg/ml 
IC
50) enrolled in Group A to  receive two intravenous infusions  of 3BNC117, 
administered at 30 mg/kg  on day 0 and day 21 (Group A ). Eight additional subjects with 
3BNC117 sensitive virus (<  2µg/ml IC 50) will be enrolled to receive four intravenous 
infusions  of 3BNC117, administered at 30 mg/kg  on day 0, day 14, day 28 and day 42 
(Group B). As 3BNC117 has not been administered four times to single individuals to 
date, Group B will be started with a mini cohort (n=3). Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_181966] [ADDRESS_1198471] 3BNC117 
infusion (week 12). We project screening 50 subjects in order to achieve 1 6 evaluable 
subjects . In case of drop -outs an over -enrollment of 10% will be allowed.  
 The same ART regimen will be resumed at week 12.  ART regimen will be resumed 
sooner if plasma HIV -1 RNA level is ≥  200 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/ml or if CD4+ count drops < 350 
cells/µl and either result is confirmed upon repeat measurement  during the next weekly 
scheduled visit. If plasma HIV -1 RNA level  is ≥ 1,000 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/ml, the participant will be 
asked to return for a repeat measurement prior to the next scheduled visit, and ART will be resumed if results are confirmed.  ART will also be resumed early if the participant  
becomes pregnant, or if otherwise clinically indicated . If ART regimen is  resumed before  
completion of  3BNC117 infusions, further 3BNC117 infusions  will not be performed. All 
subjects will be followed weekly until week 12 for safety assessments and for monitoring plasma HIV -1 RNA levels. CD4+ T cell counts will be monitored every 2 weeks until 
week 12. After week 12 subjects will be followed as outlined in the Time of Event s 
Schedule (Appendix A).  
Subjects will be offered a continuation of the treatment interruption through week 36, 
coordinated with their primary care physician as long as viral rebound does not occur. In

PROTOCOL # MCA -0867 
CONFIDENTIAL  40 the extension phase of the study subjects will return for follow up every week, while off 
ART . ART resumption will follow same criteria as detailed above.  
 
The subjects’ primary care physician will be consulted on any changes in antiretroviral 
treatment. In addition, non- research results will be communicated  to the subjects’ 
primary care physician after each study visit during all phases of the study. Safety and PK 
assessments will be performed at multiple time points following 3BNC117 infusion s (see 
Appendix A). Subjects will be followed for 36 weeks from enrollment.  
 
8.2 Analysis of Antiretroviral effects, Safety and Pharmacokinetics  
 
Primary Objectives : 
 
1. 3BNC117’s effect on virologic rebound:  
 A one sided less Binomial Test with Clopper -Pearson confidence interval at 95% for rate 
of rebound will allow us to determine the population probability for the “occurrence of rebound”, with 95% of statistical significance level (Clopper, C.; Pearson, E. S. (1934)).   
 Kaplan -Meier estimator will be used to address the second variable, “time to rebound” 
(Kaplan, E. L.; Meier, P. (1958) . 
 2. 3BNC117’s safety and tolerability profile in HIV -infected subje cts with suppressed 
viremia during an analytical treatment interruption: 
 The number and percentage of subjects experiencing one or more AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_8792], and severity. AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_859889], according to system organ 
class (SOC) and preferred term. AEs will also be summarized by [CONTACT_859890] (see Appendix B ). 
The CTCAE v4.03 grading scale will be used for reporting and grading adverse events related to infusion reactions and cytokine release syndromes in all groups.  
 
The changes in hematology, chemistry, and other laboratory values will be summarized descriptively. Changes will b e calculated relative to the values collected at baseline.  
 3. 3BNC117’s pharmacokinetic profile in HIV -infected subjects with suppressed 
viremia during an analytical treatment interruption:  
Pharmacokinetic parameters will be calculated using standard non- compartmental 
analysis methods. Pharmacokinetic parameters, including AUC, Cmax, T ½, Tmax and 
others will be summarized.  A 95% two tails matched pairs T -test will be used to compare 
3BNC117 ser um levels before and after each  antibody infusion. Pharmaco kinetic 
parameters will be examined to correlate exposure with safety and pharmacodynamic parameters . Variance based on population intrinsic factors such as weight and gender will 
be explored.

PROTOCOL # MCA -0867 
CONFIDENTIAL  41  
Secondary and Exploratory Objectives:  
 
1. The range of 3BNC117 serum levels at which virologic rebound occurs:  
 For each participant the time to rebound and the concentration of 3BNC117 at the time of rebound will be determined and summarized using confidence intervals.  
 2.  
Compare the rate and time to  rebound between groups:  
 A Fisher exact test will allow us to contrast the rate of rebound between groups and Kruskal –Wallis one -way analysis of variance will be used to compare the mean time to 
rebound. For both tests a 95% significance level will be assumed.  3. Host immune responses
: 
A 95% repeated measures ANOVA F -test will be used to compare the following 
variables, at baseline, [ADDRESS_1198472]  infusion, at week s 12 and 36:  
• serum levels of inflammation markers, such as: C -reactive protein, D -dimers,  
IL-6 and soluble CD -14. 
• CD8+ T cell expression of activation markers such as: HLA -DR, CD38 and 
PD-1. 
• HIV gag and env- specific T and B cell immune responses will be evaluated by 
[CONTACT_859891].  
 4. Antiretroviral effects
: 
A 95% repeated measures ANOVA F -test will be used to compare the following 
variables, before as well as [ADDRESS_1198473] infusion if viral rebound does not 
occur : 
• levels of plasma HIV -1 RNA by [CONTACT_245142];  
• levels of cell -associated HIV -1 RNA  and DNA;  
  5.  Other measurements
: 
 The frequency and levels of anti -3BNC117 antibodies after each 3BNC117 infusion will 
be calculated and displayed in tables.   
Genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_859854]. This will allow us to phylogenetically compare viruses grown from 
PBMCs collected from subjects while on ART to rebound viruses coll ected after 
treatment interruption  and analyze the induction of escape mutations . In addition, 
amplified HIV envelope genes will be cloned and produced in pseudoviruses in order to 
test for resistance to 3BNC117 by [CONTACT_764842] -bl neutralization assay. Results will be 
descriptive.

8.3 Sample Size Considerations  
The confidence interval calculation is based on one of the primary objectives of this study 
“Evaluate the effect of two or four infusions of 3BNC117 at 30 mg/kg in delaying 
virologic rebound and maintaining vi ral suppression during a short analytical treatment 
interruption ”. As such, the primary outcome is the occurrence of rebound during 
treatment interruption.  
 In study group A, [ADDRESS_1198475] experienced viral rebound to date. Eight  participants will be enrolled in the new study 
group B and will be administered four 3BNC117 infusions at days 0, 14, 28 and 42.  
A one -sided upper confidence interval will be constructed for the probability of rebound 
in study group B using the Clopper -Pearson method. As such, a sample size of 8 HIV-
infected individuals will allow the rejection of the  null hypothesis (rate  = 1) with 80% 
power for an effect size equal or higher than 0. 18, if at least 4  out of 8 participants 
enrolled in study group B  do not experience viral rebound by [CONTACT_5875] 8 . The one -sided 95% 
Clopper -Pearson confidence intervals calculated for a varying number of observed 
rebounds are presented in Table 1 . If 5 or more participants in group B experience viral 
rebound prior to study week 6 [[ADDRESS_1198476] 3BNC117 infusion], additional 
participants will not undergo ATI . 
 Table 1. Upper bound Confidence Interval  
for a sample size of n=8 (Study Group B)  
 
We will compare days from date of ART interruption to viral rebound in group A to group B. Given a standard deviation (SD) of 10 (days), enrolling [ADDRESS_1198477] 80% power to detect ≥ 15 days 
difference in time to viral rebound at a 5% 
significance level (Davey  et al., 1999, 
Rothenberger et al., 2015) .  
 
The safety population will include all subjects who receive a 3BNC117 infusion. A baseline measurement and at least one laboratory, vital sign, or other safety -related measurement obtained 
after at least one dose of study treatment may be required for incl usion in the analysis of 
a specific safety parameter.  
 All adverse events will be reported, grouped as to whether or not they qualify as SAEs, their severity grading, and their relationship to the antibody , as judged by [CONTACT_859892]

[ADDRESS_1198483] including to the fetus  
• This study entails moderate risk to subjects since 3BNC117 is an investigational new 
drug with limited human safety data. The study also includes a period of ART 
interruption.  It has been shown that epi[INVESTIGATOR_859856]4+ count decline 
leads to increased risk of opportunistic infections as compared with continuous ART (El-Sadr W et al.  NEJM 2006, SMART trial). However, different groups have now 
shown that short analytical treatment interruption is safe ( Routy et al., 2012) . ART 
will be resumed if plasma HIV -1 RNA levels increase to ≥  200 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/ml and are 
confirmed upon repeated measurement (performed within [ADDRESS_1198484] measurement).  
 
• If the HIV -1 viremia rebounds after ART is discontinued, absolute CD4+ counts 
might drop. However subjects will be followed very closely and ART will be 
resumed if the CD4+ cell count drops < 350 cells/ µl and this is confirmed upon repeat 
measurement .  
 • During ART interruption, subjects might experience symptoms of acute retroviral 
syndrome, such as fever, rash, swollen glands, headache, sore throat, nausea, 
vomiting. ART will be resumed if acute retroviral syndrome is suspected by [CONTACT_2792].  
 
• Resistant viral strains to previous ART medications might arise during the analytical 
treatment interruption.

• During the ART -interruption phase of the study subjects may be at increased risk of 
transmitting HIV to their partners, if they become viremic, and  of HIV -[ADDRESS_1198485] may re -initiate ART as c linically 
indicated by [CONTACT_5657]/her primary care physician.  
  
• 3BNC117 has now been administ ered to 63 volunteers  (55 under protocol MCA -835 
and 8 under this protocol – study group A)  and it was generally safe and well 
tolerated in all doses tested. Sixteen  volunteers have been admin istered [ADDRESS_1198486] 
time evaluate the safety of four infusions of 3BNC117 administered  2 weeks apart. 
The risk of repeated 3BNC117 infusions is not yet known.  
 
• While each mAb product has unique safety issues related to its mechanism of action, 
the major safety concern related to mAbs in general is an infusion/hypersensitivity 
reaction. These types of reactions are more common for mAbs that contain murine elements compared to human mAbs, such as 3BNC117. Passive administration of anti-HIV-[ADDRESS_1198487] adverse events observed were infusion- related events. Grade I 
partial thromboplastin time (PTT) prolongations were also noted in one study that tested a combination of three anti -HIV monoclonal antibodies ( Mehandru et al., 
2007b; Trkola et al., 2005b) .  
 
• Immunologic symptoms such as listed below are possible with administration of a 
monoclonal antibody and will be considered adverse events of interest.  Potential 
allergic -type reactions during and immediately following the administration of 
3BNC117 will be  carefully monitored.   
o Constitutional symptoms, such as fever, rigors/chills;  
o Injection site reaction/extravasation changes, pruritus, urticaria;  
o Serum sickness like syndromes as evidenced by [CONTACT_411], rash, arthralgia, arthritis,  nephritis;  
o Deposition of i mmune complexes in the kidneys leading to renal 
insufficiency;  
o Adult Respi[INVESTIGATOR_39053], bronchospasm/wheezing , anaphy laxis; 
o Cytokine release syndrome/ acute infusion reaction.  
 
• 3BNC117- resistant viral strains might arise following administration of 3BNC117. 
Development of 3BNC117 resistance might limit the future use of 3BNC117 by [CONTACT_1177], if this monoclonal antibody is licensed for clinical use by [CONTACT_1622].  
 
• In the cross -reactivity study in human tissues, 3BNC117 was found to bind t o cells in 
the conjunctival recesses. It is possible that this binding could lead to conjunctival 
toxicity. However , when rats and non- human primates were administered 3BNC117,

• The adverse effects 3BNC117 administration would have  in a fetus or unborn child 
are unknown.  
 
13 Procedures to minimize risk  
• As outlined above, this study will be an exploratory phase I I trial of 3BNC117 in 
humans. Potential trial volunteers will be informed about the possible risks of the 
monoclonal antibody administration and that there may be unknown risks.  
 
• Medical records and routine laboratory data will be handled with HIPAA compli ance 
and protected by [CONTACT_859896] H, JCAHO approved institutions . 
 • With any new medicine or monoclonal antibody, there is a possibility of totally 
unexpected side effects. Subjects will be closely monitored for 1.[ADDRESS_1198490], he/she will be transferred to the neighboring tertiary care center, [LOCATION_001] Presby[CONTACT_24021][INVESTIGATOR_307] (Cornell) for specialized medical care.  So far, 3BN C117 has 
been administered to  55 individuals in protocol MCA -835 and 8 in this protocol 
(MCA -867) without any acute unexpected events.  A maximum of two participants 
will receive a 3BNC117 infusion per day. Infusions will not be given simultaneously.  
 
• Subjects will be closely monitored for the development of symptoms of ocular 
disease (such as blurry vision, increased lacrimation, redness, dryness, pain) and the 
study investigators will perform a directed exam of the eyes. If subjects develop symptoms or signs of ocular disease, they will be referred to an ophthalmologist for diagnosis and management. These evaluations  will be performed at no cost to the 
subject.  
 
• During the treatment interruption phase of the study, plasma HIV -1 RNA levels will 
be monitored weekly and CD4+ T cell counts will be monitored every other week. ART regimen will be resumed if plasma HIV -1 RNA level is  ≥  200 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/ml, CD4+ 
T cell count d rops < 350 cells/ µl, and either  result  is confirmed upon repeat 
measurement, during the next weekly scheduled visit. If  plasma HIV -1 RNA level  is 
≥ 1,000 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/ml, the participant will be asked to return for a repeat measurement 
prior to the next schedule d visit, and ART will be resumed if results are confirmed.

CONFIDENTIAL  47 ART will also be resumed early if the participant  becomes pregnant, or if  otherwise  
clinically indicated.  If ART regimen is resumed before completion of  3BNC117 
infusions, further 3BNC117 infusions  will not be performed.  
 
• In order to minimize the risk of resistance to the previous ART regimen, all 
antiretroviral drugs will be stopped simultaneously and ART will be resumed 
according to the above criteria . Non -nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors have 
longer elimination half -lives than other antiretroviral classes. Therefore, in order to 
avoid the risk of inadvertent monotherapy, which can select NNRTI resistant strains, if the subject’s ART regimen includes an NNRTI, the NNRTI will be switched to dolutegravir (an integrase inhibitor) 4 weeks prior discontinuing all antiretroviral drugs . Dolutegravir will be provided to the subjects for that time period.  
 
•  In order to minimize the risk of transmitting HIV to their partners, if they become 
viremic , and of HIV -[ADDRESS_1198491] may re -initiate 
ART as clinically indicated by [CONTACT_5657]/her primary care physician.  
 
• To minimize risks associated with phlebotomy, blood drawing will be performed by 
[CONTACT_190036]. Should discomfort occur, they will provide appropriate 
treatment.  
 
• To minimize risks associated with blood drawing, volunteers will be closely 
monitored for signs and symptoms of anemia.  
 
• Females of childbearing potential and who participate in sexual activity that might lead to pregnancy will be advised to use a reliable form of contraception for the 
duration of the study. In addition, a pregnancy test will be performed at screening, on the day s of drug infusion, and throughout the course of the study.  Males who are not 
anatomically sterile and who participate in sexual activity that might lead to pregnancy will be advised to use condoms from screening throughout the duration of the study to avoid pregnancy in a spouse or partner. Condoms will be provided.   
• Subjects will have regularly scheduled visits to the outpatient clinic and r outine safety 
laboratories [CBC, clinical chemistries, liver function tests, and urinalysis] will be checked according to the Time of Events Schedule (Appendix A). HIV -infected 
individuals will have close monitoring of HIV -1 viral load and CD4/CD8 counts 
according to the Time of Events Schedule (Appendix A).  
 
• Adverse events will be monitored and graded using the DAIDS AE Grading Table. 
The CTCAE v4.03 grading scale will be used for reporting and grading adverse 
events related to infusion reactions and cytokine release syndromes in all groups (Appendix B).

The SMC  will be asked to review safety data as needed:  
-        Severe clinical adverse/reactogenicity events judged by [CONTACT_458] 
[INVESTIGATOR_859857], probably or definitely related to 3BNC117. 
-        Severe laboratory adverse events confirmed on retest and judged by [CONTACT_1961] [INVESTIGATOR_61021], probably or definitely related to 3BNC117. 
-      SAEs and unanticipated adverse events will be reported to the  SMC  within [ADDRESS_1198494] two members of 
the SMC . Following this review, the  SMC  member(s) will make a recommendation to the 
principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_859858].  
 
In addition, the SMC will review all available safety data up to day 21 (1 week after 
second infusion) of the first [ADDRESS_1198495] dose will be administered 2 weeks following the second dose (day 28) and the fourth dose will follow two weeks later (day 42). Two we eks after the 
third subject in g roup B receives the fourth dose, all available safety data wi ll be 
reviewed by [CONTACT_4484].  If the SMC determines it is safe to proceed, additional subjects  (n 
= 5) will be enrolled to receive [ADDRESS_1198496] annually. The study team will provide the SMC with updated records of all adverse events (AEs) of a grade [ADDRESS_1198497] annually.  
    
The SMC will provide a written report to the PI s after each evaluation and  the PI s in turn 
will distribute these reports to the study team, the local IRBs and the FDA.

The Rockefeller University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_859859]. RU  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_859860], should the need arise. In case of an emergency, after stabilization of the volunteer, he/she will be transferred to the neighboring tertiary care center, [LOCATION_001] Presby[CONTACT_24021][INVESTIGATOR_307] (Cornell) for specialized medical care.  
 
15.3 Monitoring  
Safety monitoring will be conducted by [CONTACT_859900]. An 
external SMC will review SAE’s and Unanticipated AEs and will be available to the 
study investigators for consultation. The RU IRB will conduct the initial review of the propos ed study and will follow progress through annual reports and by [CONTACT_859901] .  External monitoring will occur at least quarterly.  
 15.4 Adverse Event Classification  
• Scales to be used: the DAIDS AE Grading Table, the CTCAE v4.03 gradi ng scale 
will be used for reporting and grading adverse events related to infusion reactions and cytokine release syndromes (Appendix B).  
  15.[ADDRESS_1198499] annually.  Serious Adverse 
Events, (SAEs) will be reported to the local IRBs and to the s ponsor  at the Rockefeller 
University  according to policy, within two working days of identification of the SAE.  
The RU sponsor will report SAEs directly to the FDA, per 21 CFR 312.  
 15.6 Reporting Unanticipated AEs:  
Unanticipated Adverse Events (UAEs) will be reported to the local IRBs.  UAEs that are 
related and greater than moderate severity must be reported to the local IRBs and to the 
sponsor  at the Rockefeller University  according to policy, wi thin two working days of 
identification of the UAE.  The RU sponsor will report  UAEs to the FDA, per 21 CRF 
312.   
15.7 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment/Clinical Laboratory 
Evaluation Program (CLIA/CLEP)  
This study includes tests that are not CLIA/CLEP certified. The results of such tests will not be used in clinical decision- making or shared with subjects or their health care 
providers.  
 15.8 Toxicity Management and Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1869]  
A dose limiting toxicity (DLT) will be defined as any adverse event of ≥  Grade 3 
toxicity, if the study investigators recognize a probable or definite attribution to 3BNC117. In case of DLTs, further enrollment will not occur until investigators and SMC review the event.  The investigators and SMC will mutually assess the infor mation,

warranted. Enrollment will stop but volunteers will continue to be monitored by [CONTACT_30967].  
 
Volunteers will be withdrawn from the study if: a) th e study team feels that continued 
participation in the study would be harmful to the health of a subject; b) if the study 
volunteer fails to comply with the study procedures and/or fails to keep study visit appointments; c) The RU  IRB decided to stop or ca ncel the study for any reason.

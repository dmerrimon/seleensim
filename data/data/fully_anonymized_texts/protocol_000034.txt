   v ABSTRACT Context:   Red blood cell transfusion remains a critical therapy for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). A major problem is the high rate of alloimmunization (antibody formation against transfused red cells) that occurs in patients with SCD. Recent studies performed by [CONTACT_345568] a major risk factor leading to Rh alloimmunization. Anti-D formation in D+ patients occurs frequently, and once identified, providing D- cells for all subsequent transfusions can be challenging. These anti-D antibodies in D+ patients suggest exposure to different or variant D protein on donor cells. We will test whether transfusion of patients with anti-D with RHD genotyped matched red cells is feasible, safe and can decrease D- donor unit demand.  Objectives:  Primary: we will prospectively study whether provision of RHD genotype and C, E, K matched red cells to chronically transfused patients with a history of anti-D is feasible and safe. Study Design:  This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_345541] D+ RBCs to chronically transfused patients with SCD who type D+ but have formed anti-D and are currently transfused with D- RBC units. Setting/Participants: The study setting will be the apheresis unit, the outpatient day hospi[INVESTIGATOR_345542]’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6684].  There will be two sites: The Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6684], [LOCATION_001] Blood Center.  We will recruit 20 subjects overall from The Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6684]. The first 5 subjects enrolled will be adults.  Inclusion Criteria include: • Diagnosis of SCD, all genotypes • Require a period of chronic red cell transfusion therapy • Require a minimum of 3 units per transfusion visit • History of anti-D (anti-D not detectable at screening visit and past 6 months) • RH genotype predicts D+ expression   Study Interventions and Measures:  We will provide one red cell unit of D+ RH genotype matched RBCs at the first transfusion study visit. The remainder of units will be provided per clinical standard of care, i.e. D-, CEK-matched, and negative for all other antigens the patient is alloimmunized against. If laboratory monitoring shows no reappearance of anti-D and no signs of increased red cell hemolysis, the patient will receive one unit of D+ RH genotype matched RBCs at the 2nd transfusion study visit, and if tolerated, D+ red cell exposures will increase by [CONTACT_345569] D+. 
       
   vi For subjects with a history of stroke/recurrent transient ischemic attack or other indication who require tight control of Hb S and RH genotyped blood is not available, standard of care serologic matched blood would be administered rather than delaying transfusion and risking higher Hb S level. We will collect a pre-transfusion sample to prospectively store plasma on all study subjects.  Study participants will return 5-[ADDRESS_429107]-transfusion for a CBC, reticulocyte count, hgb quantification, bilirubin level, and antibody screen to evaluate for anti-D reappearance or red cell hemolysis. Main study outcome measures are feasibility of identifying sufficient RH genotype matched units (identifying sufficient RH genotype match red cells without delays in transfusion), and safety (no anti-D reappearance or evidence of hemolysis of transfused red cells).

Recent studies reveal RH gene variation is common in patients with SCD and in African-American blood donors, and contributes to Rh alloimmunization. Many D+ patients have formed anti-D, and now require D- units. These anti-D suggest exposure to different or variant D antigen on donor cells.

   1 1 BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND RATIONALE 1.1 Introduction Red blood cell transfusion remains a life-saving therapy for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD).  A major problem is the high rate of alloimmunization (antibody formation against transfused red cells) that occurs in transfused patients with SCD. Alloimmunization leads to delays in care, increases costs, and makes transfusion therapy unsafe and impossible for some patients.  The most common antibodies formed by [CONTACT_345572].  Genetic diversity in Rh antigens in patients and blood donors of African descent contributes to the high incidence and complexity of antibodies found in patients with SCD.[ADDRESS_429112] serologic assays are transfused to patients with SCD, they would only be truly Rh-matched with DNA-based matching. Many D+ patients have formed anti-D, and now require D- units, resulting in new challenges. These anti-D suggest exposure to different or variant D protein on donor cells. The major goal of this study is to perform pi[INVESTIGATOR_345547] D+ RBCs to chronically transfused patients with SCD and anti-D is feasible, safe, and can lessen demand for D- RBC units.  RH genotype matched red cells are not currently available for transfusion outside this study except for rare cases. We will determine the feasibility of identifying adequate genotype matched donor units in real clinical practice, identify barriers, and prospectively monitor patients for anti-D reappearance or signs of hemolysis. 1.[ADDRESS_429113] or Intervention Chronically transfused patients with SCD and anti-D will receive D+ RH genotyped matched red cell units for transfusion in addition to standard C, E, and K antigen matching and being hemoglobin S negative, which is our institutional standard of care for patients with SCD. RH genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_345548], led by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Connie Westhoff, co-investigator.   1.[ADDRESS_429114] immunogenic.  Since sensitization to Rh antigens (D, C, c, E, e) and to K (a Kell system antigen) comprise a majority of the RBC antibodies encountered in patients with SCD, consensus guidelines including the [ADDRESS_429115] similar blood group antigen profiles, has also been suggested to mitigate exposure to foreign antigens that cause high rates of alloimmunization. This approach has been combined with C, E, K matching for over two decades at The Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6684] (CHOP).  RBC alloimmunization despi[INVESTIGATOR_345549]  
   
   2 We performed a 15-year retrospective analysis to assess antigen matching for D, C, E, K and transfusion from African American donors on alloimmunization rates, antibody specificity, and clinical significance in pediatric and young adult patients with SCD (featured article in BLOOD).1 Our study included 182 patients who received a total of 44,482 RBC units. Surprisingly, we found 58% of 123 chronic and 15% of 59 epi[INVESTIGATOR_345550] (median units transfused per patient was 230 and 3, respectively).  Two-thirds of the antibodies formed were directed against the same Rh blood group antigens that were targeted for prevention (D, E, e, C, c, Fig. 1A).  Notably, the majority of Rh antibodies occurred in patients whose red cells were phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_345551] a “self” antigen. Anti-D was identified in 29 patients whose cells all typed D+ (Fig. 1B).  Overall, one-third of these antibodies were clinically significant with lower hemoglobin (hgb) or % hgb S levels than their baseline pre-transfusion values, suggestive that the patient hemolyzed the transfused RBCs. 
Genetic analysis of the two genes that encode the Rh antigens, RHD and RHCE, revealed that >85% of our patients carry variant alleles that result in loss or alteration of Rh antigenic epi[INVESTIGATOR_322].1 We subsequently showed that African American donors share a similar degree of RH genetic variation.4  Variant Rh antigens are not detected by [CONTACT_345573] (D,C,c,E,e).  Consequently, patients with SCD are at risk of Rh antibody formation when exposed to conventional Rh antigens on donor red cells,1 or other foreign Rh variants on African American donor cells.4  This problem is unique to patients with SCD who are primarily of African Black ethnicity, as RH variation occurs in <3% of individuals from other ethnic populations, but up to 85% of Blacks. For anti-D, we identified numerous D+ patients with at least one conventional RHD allele, yet still formed anti-D antibodies, suggesting an immune response to variant D exposure from African American donor units.  RH genes and proteins The Rh system is the most complex of all blood group systems and includes greater than [ADDRESS_429116] serologic “Rh typi[INVESTIGATOR_007]” of red cells tests for the five common antigens in all populations (D,C,c,E,e). The Rh proteins are encoded by [CONTACT_345574]: RHD encodes the D antigen and RHCE encodes the CE antigens in various combinations (ce, cE, Ce, CE) (Fig. 2).  Individuals with D antigen expressed are “Rh positive” and the absence of D, usually due to RHD gene deletion, are “Rh negative.” The highest incidence of “Rh negative” (~15%) occurs in those of European ancestry. The RH genes are inherited as a haplotype, and allele frequencies differ in various populations.   Figure 1. Alloimmunization in 182 patients with SCD transfused with D,C,E,K-matched RBCs from minority donors. A. 146 antibodies were identified and 70% had Rh specificity. B. 56 Rh antibodies occurred in patients whose RBCs typed positive for that antigen (sometimes mistaken for “autoantibodies”), and 35 were identified in antigen-negative patients despi[INVESTIGATOR_345552]-matched RBCs (i.e. negative for that antigen). 
AB
   
   3 Rh variants encode “partial” Rh antigens undetectable with current typi[INVESTIGATOR_345553] “partial” Rh antigens because they lack common epi[INVESTIGATOR_322].  Patients with variant RH who lack commonly encoded epi[INVESTIGATOR_345554]. Thus, D+ individuals with “partial D” antigen may form anti-D (to the epi[INVESTIGATOR_345555] D they lack) when exposed to conventional D antigen.1 For example, RHD*DAU4 encodes a protein in which lysine replaces glutamic acid at amino acid position 233 resulting in loss or alteration of one or more common RhD epi[INVESTIGATOR_322] (Fig. 2).  Variant RHCE alleles encoding “partial C, c, or e antigens” occurs frequently in African Blacks, and their RBCs often lack high prevalence Rh antigenic epi[INVESTIGATOR_322], such as hrB and hrS, and express novel antigenic epi[INVESTIGATOR_322] (V, VS).  The relatively common altered allele, RHCE*ce(733G), encodes a new antigen VS and loss of the high prevalence antigen hrB (Fig. 2).  We demonstrated that variant RHD or RHCE contributes to Rh alloimmunization and delayed transfusion reactions in patients with SCD.1,5  Inheritance of variant RH alleles explained ~1/[ADDRESS_429117] step.  In a recent publication from Brazil, 11 patients with SCD requiring chronic transfusion who typed D+ and had a history of anti-D, were switched from D- to D+ units after RH genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_345556].6 The D+ donor units were not RH genotype matched, so they only switched patients who had at least one conventional RHD allele. The authors reported that no patient exhibited adverse effects or hemolytic transfusion reactions to transfusion with D+ red cells, and over 200 D- units remained in the inventory for emergencies or transfusion of D- individuals on an annual basis. 1.4 Compliance Statement This study will be conducted in full accordance of all applicable Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_158737] 45 CFR 46, and the Good Clinical Practice: Consolidated Guideline approved by [CONTACT_5787] (ICH). All epi[INVESTIGATOR_48478].  Figure 2. Rh proteins. Predicted 12 transmembrane RhD and RhCE proteins (left). The amino acid differences between conventional RhD and RhCE are shown as red circles.

   4 The investigators will perform the study in accordance with this protocol, will obtain consent and assent, and will report unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others in accordance with The Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_137069]. Collection, recording, and reporting of data will be accurate and will ensure the privacy, health, and welfare of research subjects during and after the study.  2 STUDY OBJECTIVES The purpose of the study is to determine the feasibility, safety and challenges of transfusing RHD genotype matched donor red cells for D+ patients with SCD and history of anti-D. 2.1 Primary Objective The primary objective of this study is to determine the feasibility and safety of RH genotype matched red cells (intervention) for chronically transfused D+ patients with SCD and history of anti-D.  We will determine whether sufficient RHD genotyped units can be matched to the patient’s own RH genotype, and whether re-exposure to D+ units that are RHD genotype matched is safe, as monitored by [CONTACT_14181]-D reappearance or signs of hemolysis.   [ADDRESS_429119]. We will obtain IRB approval before opening enrollment to children.   3.1.1 Screening Phase and Baseline Assessment Potential subjects will be screened using the protocol inclusion and exclusion criteria. We will identify D+ patients with a historical anti-D that is not currently detectable, and on a chronic transfusion program (by [CONTACT_345575]). Eligible subjects will be approached in the hematology clinic, the Apheresis Unit, the Day Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (where patients receive straight transfusions), or the inpatient units at The Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6684].  Subject/parental/guardian permission (informed consent) and, if applicable, child assent, will be obtained prior to any study related procedures being performed, including discontinuation of current therapy.   A baseline assessment will be performed at the time of a clinic, day hospi[INVESTIGATOR_345557], or apheresis visit. At the baseline assessment, one of the clinical study team members will obtain a medical history, physical exam, and review pertinent laboratory studies. 3.1.2 Intervention visit Intervention visits will occur at the time of each of the patient’s scheduled transfusion visits.  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], patients requiring chronic transfusion therapy present for transfusion every 3-5 weeks to maintain their target hemoglobin S level.  At these intervention visits, a member of the research team will obtain an interim medical history, as well as review clinically obtained vital signs and laboratory evaluations. At the time 
   
   5 of pre-transfusion blood draw, IV placement or central line access, 5-10 ml of blood will be drawn for study evaluations (for additional antibody evaluation as needed). Patients will receive their transfusions as ordered for their clinical indication, but will receive red cell units from the blood bank that are RH genotype matched in addition to standard C, E, and K antigen matching. Other red cell processing such as irradiation, leukoreduction and/or washing will occur as clinically indicated. We will transfuse one D+ unit matched by [CONTACT_345576], increase D+ units incrementally with subsequent transfusion visits, and monitor for anti-D re-demonstration and signs of hemolysis or other adverse effects. Adverse events will be assessed at each of these intervention visits. The next transfusion and intervention visit will be scheduled prior to the subject’s discharge from their transfusion visit. A laboratory visit will be scheduled [ADDRESS_429120]’s last transfusion and intervention visit.   3.[ADDRESS_429121] will be up to 2 years, with up to 1 day of screening and baseline assessment, up to 1.5 years of Intervention visits, and 6 months follow-up. 3.2.2 Total Number of Study Sites/Total Number of Subjects Projected The study will be conducted at 2 investigative sites in the [LOCATION_002]. The Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6684], and The [LOCATION_001] Blood Center (no subject enrollment, providing RH genotyped red cell units and engaged in research activities). Recruitment will stop when approximately [ADDRESS_429122] safety and preliminary efficacy data, before enrolling children to the study 3.3.1 Inclusion Criteria 1) Males or females age > 8 years.   2) Diagnosis of SCD, all genotypes  3) Requires chronic red cell transfusion therapy  4) Requires a minimum of 3 units per transfusion visit  
   
   6 5) History of anti-D  6) RH genotype predicts D+ expression  7) Anti-D not detectable at screening visit and past 6 months 3.3.2 Exclusion Criteria 1) Rare RH genotype that would preclude sufficient RBC units 2) Antigen negative requirements due to alloimmunization that would preclude sufficient RBC units 3) Parents/guardians or subjects who, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], may be non-compliant with study schedules or procedures. Subjects that do not meet all of the enrollment criteria may not be enrolled. Any violations of these criteria must be reported in accordance with IRB Policies and Procedures.  For subjects with a history of stroke/recurrent transient ischemic attack or other indication who require tight control of Hb S and RH genotyped blood is not available, standard of care serologic matched blood would be administered rather than delaying transfusion and risking higher Hb S level. 4 STUDY PROCEDURES 4.1 Screening Visit and Baseline Assessment The screening visit and baseline assessment will occur on the same day with the following procedures: • Informed consent • Review inclusion/exclusion criteria • Demographics/medical history • Medication review • Physical exam • Vital signs • Laboratory test review • Medical Record Review 4.[ADDRESS_429123]’s transfusion visits as per the subject’s clinical indication for chronic transfusion therapy. We will provide one unit of D+ RH genotype matched RBCs at the first transfusion study visit (Figure 3). The remainder of units will be D-, CEK-matched, and negative for all other antigens the patient is alloimmunized 
   
   [ADDRESS_429124]. In this manner, should anti-D be re-stimulated, only one unit of the 3 to 11 units required for red cell exchange will be at risk for hemolysis, and the patient would not become

One D+ unit will be matched by [CONTACT_345577], and an increasing number of D+ units will be issued at consecutive RBC exchange visits. U, unit. Triangle denotes a study visit for laboratory studies including an antibody screen, CBC, hemoglobin quantification and bilirubin level acutely anemic. If laboratory monitoring shows no anti-D re-appearance or signs of increased hemolysis, the patient will receive one unit of D+ RH genotype matched RBCs at the 2nd transfusion study visit, and again if no anti-D re-appearance or signs of increased hemolysis,  we will increase by [CONTACT_31806] D+ unit per study visit until all units are D+. If a patient re-demonstrates anti-D, we will end that subject’s participation and he/she will resume transfusions with D negative RBC units.  All patients with SCD on chronic transfusion therapy have a pre-transfusion complete blood count (CBC), Hgb quantification to determine %hgb A and S levels, and an antibody screen. We will collect a pre-transfusion sample to prospectively store plasma on all study subjects. Patients undergoing chronic red cell exchange will have an immediate post-procedure CBC and hgb quantification as standard of care. Study participants will return 5-[ADDRESS_429125]-transfusion for a CBC/reticulocyte count, hgb quantification, bilirubin level, and antibody screen to evaluate for anti-D recrudescence or red cell hemolysis (Table 2).

It will also include evaluation for any delays in transfusion of red cells. If a patient re-demonstrates anti-D, we will end that subject’s participation and he/she will resume transfusions with D negative RBC units. We will have a medical monitor independent of the study team who is familiar with SCD and transfusion, and blood bank procedures. The medical monitor will review safety data, including antibody screens for anti-D reappearance, and other laboratory studies, i.e blood counts and hemoglobin quantifications, for signs of transfused red cell hemolysis.

   12 6 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_345559] D+ red cells to patients with SCD and anti-D who require chronic transfusion therapy.   6.1 Primary Endpoint The primary endpoint is the feasibility and safety of providing RH genotype matched D+ red cells for patients with SCD and history of anti-D who require chronic transfusion. RH genotype matched red cells are currently not available clinically except for rare circumstances.  Descriptive, qualitative data, i.e. anti-D reappearance and signs and symptoms of increased red cell hemolysis, or delays in transfusion, will be collected to inform future multi-center studies of RH genotype matched red cells designed to test the effectiveness of providing RH genotype matched D+ red cells for patients with SCD and history of anti-D. Given that there is donor center scalability with RH genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_345560], we would consider this matching strategy feasible if provision of matched units were possible in > 85% of the transfusion study visits without a delay in transfusion. 6.[ADDRESS_429135] descriptive summaries (e.g. means and standard deviations for continuous variables such as age and percentages for categorical variables such as gender). 6.2.2 Efficacy Analysis The primary efficacy endpoints will be anti-D re-appearance, signs of increased hemolysis, and timely issue of units for transfusion.  These will be descriptive data.    6.2.3 Safety Analysis All subjects entered into the study at Visit 1 will be included in the safety analysis. The frequencies of AEs by [CONTACT_24975], severity and relationship to study intervention will be summarized. SAEs (if any) will be described in detail. The analysis will be a qualitative description of AEs. 6.[ADDRESS_429136] an additional 2-3 eligible patients per year. Therefore, we anticipate that with ~[ADDRESS_429137]’s participation and he/she will resume transfusions with D negative RBC units. If a patient’s genotype precludes readily identified RH genotype matched RBC units and a delay in transfusion is documented in 3 consecutive visits, we will consider termination of study participation for that individual.  
   
   13 7 STUDY INTERVENTION 7.1 Description The study intervention is provision of RH genotype matched D+ red cells for transfusion in chronically transfused patients with SCD and history of anti-D. All other clinical care will remain as usual, including the decision to transfuse, timing of transfusions, and the quantity of red cells to transfuse.  Red cells will be ordered from NY Blood Center using a secure online ordering system, per usual clinical practice guidelines established at CHOP for patients with SCD. Specifically, serologic C, E, and K antigen matched donor units are ordered. All units are leukoreduced, CMV-safe, and irradiated per CHOP policy. The CHOP blood bank aims to issue < 21 day old for all patients with hemoglobinopathies, particularly for those chronically transfused.  The study intervention is D+ donor units that are RH genotyped by [CONTACT_345578], and will be matched according to the patient’s RH genotype. RH genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_345561], but are performed in an American Association of Blood Banks (AABB) accredited and CLIA certified lab, and validated for sensitivity, specificity, reproducibility and repeatability by [CONTACT_345579] (LDTs). There are no current FDA approved RH genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_345562]. In fact, many assays including the RH genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_345563]. 7.1.[ADDRESS_429138] is accounted for.  Should a patient miss their appointment, the blood may be issued to non-study individuals at the discretion of the investigators. 
   
   14 8 SAFETY MANAGEMENT 8.1 Clinical Adverse Events Clinical adverse events (AEs) will be monitored throughout the study.  We will have a medical monitor independent of the study team who is familiar with SCD and transfusion, and blood bank procedures. The medical monitor will review safety data, including antibody screens for anti-D reappearance, and other laboratory studies, i.e blood counts and hemoglobin quantifications, for signs of transfused red cell hemolysis. Details about the untis transfused, including the RH genotype, and the red cell antigen profile, will be reviewed.  Any time a patient shows a re-appearance of anti-D on an antibody screen, the medical monitor will be notified, and all safety data will be reviewed. As stated above, if a subject re-demonstrates anti-D, we will end that subject’s participation and he/she will resume transfusions with D negative RBC units. If any subject shows signs of transfused red cell hemolyis, with or without an anti-D identified on the antibody screen, the medical monitor will be notified, and all safety data will be reviewed.  Study stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_345558]: 1) Three of the first 5 enrolled subjects, or greater than 50% of enrolled patients, develop re-appearance of anti-D 2) Any subject with anti-D re-appearance and clinical or laboratory evidence of transfused red cell hemolysis (dark urine, increased scleral icterus, exacerbated anemia, higher Hb S level than expected based on timing from last transfusion If either of these criteria occur, the study will be stopped, the safety medical monitor wll review all clinical and laboratory evidence to determine safety risks, and will meet with the investigative team to determine a safe course of action. The IRB would be notified and the study procedures would be suspended until approval of the IRB. 8.2 Adverse Event Reporting Unanticipated problems related to the research involving risks to subjects or others that occur during the course of this study (including SAEs) will be reported to the IRB in accordance with CHOP IRB SOP 408: Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects. AEs that are not serious but that are notable and could involve risks to subjects will be summarized in narrative or other format and submitted to the IRB at the time of continuing review.   8.[ADDRESS_429139] who has received an intervention (drug, biologic, or other intervention).  The occurrence does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable or unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. 
   
   15 All AEs (including serious AEs) will be noted in the study records and on the case report form with a full description including the nature, date and time of onset, determination of non-serious versus serious, intensity (mild, moderate, severe), duration, causality, and outcome of the event. 8.4 Definition of a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) An SAE is any adverse drug experience occurring at any dose that results in any of the following outcomes:  • death, • a life-threatening event (at risk of death at the time of the event),  • requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], • a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or • a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a subject.   Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse drug event when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. A distinction should be drawn between serious and severe AEs.  A severe AE is a major event of its type.  A severe AE does not necessarily need to be considered serious.  For example, nausea which persists for several hours may be considered severe nausea, but would not be an SAE.  On the other hand, a stroke that results in only a limited degree of disability may be considered a mild stroke, but would be an SAE.  8.4.1 Relationship of SAE to study drug or other intervention The relationship of each SAE to the study intervention should be characterized using one of the following terms in accordance with CHOP IRB Guidelines: definitely, probably, possibly, unlikely or unrelated.  8.5 IRB/IEC Notification of SAEs and Other Unanticipated Problems The Investigator will promptly notify the IRB of all on-site unanticipated, serious Adverse Events that are related to the research activity. Other unanticipated problems related to the research involving risk to subjects or others will also be reported promptly. Written reports will be filed using the eIRB system and in accordance with the timeline below. External SAEs that are both unexpected and related to the study intervention will be reported promptly after the investigator receives the report.   Type of Unanticipated Problem Initial Notification  (Phone, Email, Fax) Written Report Internal (on-site) SAEs Death or Life Threatening  24 hours Within 2 calendar days Internal (on-site) SAEs 7 days Within 7 business days 
   
   16 All other SAEs Unanticipated Problems Related to Research 7 days  Within 7 business days All other AEs N/A Brief Summary of important AEs may be reported at time of continuing review 8.5.1 Follow-up report If an SAE has not resolved at the time of the initial report and new information arises that changes the investigator’s assessment of the event, a follow-up report including all relevant new or reassessed information (e.g., concomitant medication, medical history) will be submitted to the IRB. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all SAE are followed until either resolved or stable.  8.6 Investigator Reporting of a Serious Adverse Event to Sponsor Reporting will be consistent with regulatory requirements.  8.7 Medical Emergencies Describe any plans or procedures for taking care of medical emergencies that might develop during the course of the study. Should a patient demonstrate anti-D reappearance that is associated with increased hemolysis, he/she will be treated with immunosuppression congruent to the degree of anemia and hemolysis (i.e. oral steroids, IV steroids, and/or IVIg depending on severity). If moderate to severe hemolytic transfusion reaction, he/she may need to be admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_345564] D- RBC units. 
   
   17 9 STUDY ADMINISTRATION 9.1 Data Collection and Management Primary records (source documents) and data abstraction forms for entering the data into our study database (Filemaker) will be used.  The plan is consistent with CHOP Policy A-3-6: Acceptable Use of Technology Resources that defines the requirements for encryption and security of computer systems, and addresses the following: 1. Confidentiality.  Confidentiality of the data will be ensured with the use of password-protected files. Specifically, a Filemaker database is hosted on the CHOP research network and password protected such that only the study team members have access. Data may be exported into Excel files, which can be both coded with the UPIN and a separate master list, and password-protected. Blood ordering is performed via a secure online blood ordering system hosted by [CONTACT_345578] (NY Blood Center).   2. Security.  Data is backed up intermittently as a copy of the password-protected file on the PI’s office computer and the original is hosted on one of the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]’s secure servers for research community. 3. Anonymization, de-identification or destruction.  Analyses from this study will be conducted over many years and we would like to retain PHI to link the samples with the subjects. The identifiers and data will be retained per CHOP Data Retention Policy A-3-[ADDRESS_429140] obtaining IRB approval. The investigator will obtain a data use agreement between the provider (the PI) of the data and any recipi[INVESTIGATOR_5772] (including others at CHOP) before sharing a limited dataset (PHI limited to dates and zip codes).  9.3 Regulatory and Ethical Considerations 9.3.1 Data and Safety Monitoring Plan The study has greater than minimal risk. The study intervention of RH genotype matched D+ red cells to patients with SCD and anti-D provides a higher level of matching than current standard of care, but there is a risk of anti-D reappearance, increased red cell hemolysis and delay to transfusion for up to [ADDRESS_429141]’s participation and he/she will resume transfusions with D negative RBC units. In the case of acute need for transfusion, subjects may receive non-RH genotype matched red cells that would be matched by [CONTACT_345580], i.e. D-, CEK matched red cells.  Oversight for the emerging safety information will include the PI. Red cell units will continue to be issued per standard institutional blood bank policies. 
   
   [ADDRESS_429142]’s participation and he/she will resume transfusions with D negative RBC units. If any subject shows signs of transfused red cell hemolyis, with or without an anti-D identified on the antibody screen, the medical monitor will be notified, and all safety data will be reviewed.  Study stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_345558]: 1) Two of the first [ADDRESS_429143] 5 enrolled subjects, greater than 30% of enrolled patients, develop re-appearance of anti-D 2) Any subject with anti-D re-appearance and clinical or laboratory evidence of transfused red cell hemolysis (dark urine, increased scleral icterus, exacerbated anemia, higher Hb S level than expected based on timing from last transfusion If either of these criteria occur, the study will be stopped, the safety medical monitor will review all clinical and laboratory evidence to determine safety risks, and will meet with the investigative team to determine a safe course of action. The IRB would be notified and the study procedures would be suspended until approval of the IRB. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_345565], ensure subject safety, and the accuracy and security of the data at CHOP, and will report any adverse events in accordance with the FDA regulations as they pertain to blood products and IRB policies. 9.3.2 Risk Assessment Risks are greater than minimal.  Providing D+ RBC units to a patient with history of anti-D may cause re-appearance of the anti-D with or without transfused red cell hemolysis. RH genotype matched red cells provide a higher level of matching, and thus the risk of anti-D reappearing is predicted to be very low. The study was also designed to minimize the risk of harm from anti-D reappearance by [CONTACT_345581] D+ RH genotype matched units for only [ADDRESS_429144] two visits, and then titrating up by [CONTACT_345582]. There is the possibility that transfusion would be delayed up to 7 days to identify adequate RH genotype red cell units, this may cause inconvenience (waiting or rescheduling transfusion visit).  There are risks involved with red cell transfusion, i.e. allergic reaction, infection, alloimmunization, but these risks are associated with routine clinical care and not a result of the research activities.  The risks involved with a venipuncture are pain, bleeding or bruising at the venipuncture site.  
   
   [ADDRESS_429145] as a result of participation may be demonstrating that the patient can be transfused safely with D+ RH genotype matched red cells and no longer need to rely on D- red cell units, resulting in improved ability to identify compatible units. The indirect benefits are that all patients with SCD may receive safer transfusions in the future if we find RH genotype matching is feasible.  9.3.4 Risk-Benefit Assessment RH genotype matched red cells are predicted to reduce Rh alloimmunization and result in safer transfusion products, thus, providing more benefit than risk. The risks of providing D+ units to D+ patients with history of an anti-D are greater than minimal due to risk of anti-D re-appearance and potential for increased hemolysis, but the benefit of RH genotype matched red cells that provide a higher level of matching than standard clinical practice outweigh those risks.  9.4 Recruitment Strategy Patients will be recruited from the chronic transfusion program for SCD at the Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6684]. This will primarily include patients who receive their red cell transfusions erythrocytapheresis in the Apheresis Unit, but could include patients transfused by [CONTACT_345583][INVESTIGATOR_307]. Since the principal investigator [CONTACT_832] a pediatric hematologist and transfusion medicine specialist, she will refer her own patients as well as other care providers. All patients with SCD receiving chronic transfusion therapy will be screened for eligibility. If the prospective subjects are not patients of the investigator, one of the investigators or the research coordinator will approach the subjects and offer participation in the study in person during a transfusion visit. If recruitment is poor from the apheresis transfusion cohort at CHOP, patients receiving 2-3 units for simple red cell transfusion can be recruited from the Day Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. 9.5 Informed Consent/Assent and HIPAA Authorization All prospective subjects eligible for participation in this study will be enrolled after obtaining informed consent. The study coordinator or one of the investigators will obtain consent in the Hematology Clinic, Day Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], or Apheresis Unit.  The consent process will take place in the clinic exam room, or other private room where privacy is assured. The investigational nature of the study, the study objectives, procedures involved and the potential risks and benefits will be explained to the subject and/or guardian using lay language. Consent forms will be written in a well-organized format using direct language. We will explicitly state that the choice of study participation will not impact their access to clinical care.  Assent will be obtained from all children seven years and older before study enrollment when deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_345584](s). Written informed combined consent/HIPAA authorization and assent (if applicable) will be obtained. Individuals with limited English proficiency will only be enrolled in person after obtaining written consent using the short form consent process.  9.6 Payment to Subjects/Families Subjects will be compensated a nominal amount for the inconvenience of participating in the study, which requires a return visit for laboratory studies.  Subjects will be compensated $50 per laboratory only visit, since this is a separate visit outside of routine clinical care. For patients who encounter economic hardship to travel to and from CHOP for the laboratory only

Study  
Design:   
Phase  1: Safety  Run In 
 
This portion  of the study  will assess whether  a dose  of trametinib  1.5mg  by [CONTACT_390115]  75mg  by [CONTACT_390116] a tolerable  and safe dose.  Six patients  
will be enrolled at this dose level and assessed for dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) for 1 
full cycle (28 days). Toxicity will be graded according to NCI CTCAE version 4.0. If more 
than one patient  develops  a DLT, we will move  on to the phase  2 portion  of the study  
and the dose  level -1 will be used.  If no <1 DLT is detected,  we will move  on to the 
phase  2 portion  of the study at dose  level 0.

 Dose  Level  0 1.5mg  PO qdaily  75mg  PO qdaily   
 Dose  Level  -1 1 mg PO qdaily  100mg  PO qdaily   
 
 
Phase  2: 
 
Once  the phase  1 run-in portion  of the study  has been  completed,  patients  will be 
enrolled  in the phase  2 portion  of the single -arm, two-stage,  open -label study  of 
trametinib  and erlotinib  in the treatment  of patients  with EGFR -mutant  lung cancers  with 
acquired  resistance  to erlotinib .  After screening  and registration,  patients  will be treated  
with the combination  of trametinib  and erlotinib.  Response  to therapy  will be assessed  
by [CONTACT_390117]  8 weeks  (every  2 cycles)  with CT scan  of the chest  and 
imaging  of any other  target  lesion  with response  evaluated  by [CONTACT_393]  1.1. A maximum  
of 24 patients  will be enrolled  during  this portion  of the study.  
Correlative  studies:  
 
Biopsies  will be required  within  [ADDRESS_489335]. Rudin’s  lab. The remaining  
cores  will be fixed in formalin  and sent to Surgical  Pathology.  We will use our genomics  
core facility  for all DNA and RNA extraction  and analysis.  IHC will be performed  to look 
at expression  of specific  proteins  of interest  including:   BIM, TGFB2,  vimentin,  e- 
cadherin,  n-cadherin  and neurofibromin.  Transcriptome  sequencing  (RNA -Seq) will be 
utilized  to look at changes  in gene  expression  at various  time points  of treatment  and to 
identify  potential  biomarkers  of response  to combination  therapy.   IMPACT,   our next- 
generation  sequencing  based  mutation  platform  that assesses  for genetic  alterations  in 
340 cancer -related  genes,  will be used  for molecular  analysis.

3.[ADDRESS_489336] somatic  activating  
mutations  in the epi[INVESTIGATOR_61983]  (EGFR).  Patients  with these  oncogene -addicted  
lung adenocarcinomas  have a 70% response  rate to EGFR -TKI therapy  (erlotinib,  afatinib,  or 
gefitinib)  and a median  progression -free survival  of 12 months .4 All of these  patients  will develop  
resistance  to EGFR  TKI therapy  and clinical  progression.  A mechanism  of resistance  can be 
identified  82% of the time,  with acquisition  of EGFR  T790M  seen  most  frequently.5  There  are 
several  EGFR  T790M  targeting  EGFR  inhibitors  
currently  in clinical  development.  CO-1686,  which  
targets  mutant  EGFR  including  T790M,  has a reported  
overall  response  rate of 58% in 40 patients  with centrally  
confirmed  EGFR  T790M  tumors.6 AZD9291,  another  
mutant  specific  EGFR  TKI, has a reported  response  rate 
of 64% in 107 patients  with EGFR  T790M  mutant  
tumors.7 At this time however,  there  are currently  no 
approved  drugs  available  for patients  with acquired  
resistance  to EGFR  TKIs.  Therapeutic  options  are 
especially  limited  for patients  without  acquired  EGFR  
T790M  present  in their tumors.

Role of BIM and apoptosis  
 
Expression  of the apoptotic  protein  BIM is required  for 
apoptosis  triggered  by [CONTACT_390120]  
(TKIs).2,8-10  (Figure  1) Treatment  with EGFR  TKIs 
induces  rapid  and sustained  increases  in the level of 
BIM, and knockdown  of BIM nearly  eliminates  EGFR  
TKI-induced  cell killing  in EGFR -mutant  cell lines.8 
Levels  of pre- treatment  (and post-treatment)  BIM 
predict  response  to EGFR  TKI therapy  with an 
association  of both response  rate and progression -free 
survival  on EGFR  TKI with BIM expression.  2  Similar  
results  were  seen  when  analyzing  BIM mRNA  
expression  of patients  with EGFR -mutant  lung cancers  
treated  in the EURTAC  trial.11  Progression -free survival  
on erlotinib  and overall  survival  were  shorter  in those  with 
low BIM expression.11 
The importance  of BIM was again  demonstrated  in patients  with a BIM deletion  polymorphism  that 
results  in an isoform  of BIM without  the crucial  BH3 domain  that is required  for BIM’s  apoptotic  
function.1    The presence  of this polymorphism  was predictive  of a shorter  progression  free  
survival  with erlotinib  re-emphasizing  the importance  of BIM expression  to response  to TKI 
therapy.1  (Figure  2) 
Inhibition  of the MEK/ERK  pathway  is critical  for BIM upregulation  required  for TKI-induced  
apoptosis.   MEK inhibition  is sufficient  to induce  rapid  BIM induction  by [CONTACT_390121] .[ADDRESS_489337]  of a MEK inhibitor  may be more  apparent.  Song  and colleagues  
evaluated  dual MEK and EGFR  inhibition  which  resulted  in apoptosis  in EGFR resistant,  EGFR  
T790M  containing  cell lines (H1975)  with decreased  phospho -ERK and increased  BIM 
expression .12    Induction  of BIM through  MEK inhibition  has the potential  to re-sensitize  patients  to 
EGFR  TKI irrespective  of EGFR  T790M  status  making  this a potential  treatment  strategy  in all 
patients  with acquired  resistance  to EGFR  TKI therapy.  
Additional  support  for MEK inhibition  in EGFR -mutant  lung cancers  
 
In addition  to acquisition  of EGFR  T790M,  there  are multiple  other  mechanisms  of acquired  
resistance  to EGFR  TKI therapy.  Histologic  transformation  including  epi[INVESTIGATOR_018] -mesenchymal  
transition  (EMT)  is a mechanism  of resistance  identified  in tumor  samples  in patients  treated  with 
EGFR  TKI.13    ERK/MAPK  pathway  activation  is required  for TGF-B2 induced  EMT.14  Inhibition  of 
MEK was able to prevent  EMT and augment  sensitivity  to gefitinib  in cell lines resistant  to EGFR  
TKI therapy.15

Another  mechanism  of resistance  to EGFR  
TKI identified  is decreased  expression  of 
neurofibromin  that results  in incomplete  
inhibition  of RAS/ERK  signaling  in the 
presence  of erlotinib.3  Low NF1 expression  
was associated  with both primary  and 
secondary  resistance  to EGFR  TKIs.  
Treatment  of neurofibromin  deficient  lung 
cancers  with a trametinib  and erlotinib  
restored  sensitivity  to erlotinib.  (Figure  3). 
Preliminary  data and Rationale  for Dose  
Selection:  
Trametinib  is approved  for the treatment  of 
BRAF -mutant  melanomas  at a dose  of 2mg 
orally  daily.  A phase  1 study  of trametinib  
and erlotinib  was conducted  in patients  with 
solid tumors  ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).    Twenty -two 
patients  were  treated  and 3 dose -limiting  
toxicities  were  seen:  [ADDRESS_489338] common  side effects  (>30%  of all patients),  any 
grade,  were  diarrhea,  rash,  fatigue,  nausea,  vomiting,  anorexia,  hypokalemia  and anemia.  The 
maximum  tolerated  dose  level of the combination  was determined  to be trametinib  1mg daily and 
erlotinib  100mg  daily.  No partial  or complete  responses  were  seen  in this unselected  population.  
Prophylactic  antidiarrheals  were  not utilized  on protocol.  
We hypothesize  that effective  MEK inhibition  with trametinib  will circumvent  acquired  resistance  to 
erlotinib  therapy.  We would  therefore  like to first conduct  a phase  1 safety  run in with a higher  
dose  of MEK inhibitor  (trametinib  1.5mg  once  daily)  with a reduced  dose  of erlotinib  at 75mg  once  
daily.  This dose  had not been  tested  during  the previous  phase  1 study  described  above.  It is our 
hypothesis  that a lower  dose  (75mg)  of erlotinib  would  allow  us to maximize  the dose  of trametinib  
given.  We will also utilize  prophylactic  anti-diarrheal  medications  to minimize  toxicities.  Six  
patients  will be accrued  to this portion  of the study.  If zero to one patient  experiences  a toxicity  
with these  doses,  we will move  to the phase  2 portion  of the study.  If two or more  patients  develop  
a DLT at this higher  dose  of trametinib,  we will use trametinib  1mg daily with erlotinib  100mg  daily 
during  the phase  2 portion  of the study.

Phase  1: Safety  Run in 
 
This portion  of the study  will assess whether  a dose  of trametinib  1.5mg  by [CONTACT_390122]  75mg  by [CONTACT_390116] a safe dose.  Up to six patients  will need  to be enrolled  at 
this dose level and assessed for dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) for 1 full cycle (28 days). Toxicity 
will be graded  according  to NCI CTCAE  version  4.0. If more  than one patient  develops  a DLT, we

will move  on to the phase  2 portion  of the study and the dose  level -1 will be used.  Dose  level -1 
was already  deemed  safe in a previous  phase  1 study  ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  If < 1 DLT is detected,  we 
will move  on to the phase  2 portion  of the study at dose  level 0. Two to six patients  will be enrolled  
in the phase  1 portion.

Phase  2: 
 
Once  the run-in phase  1 portion  of the study  has been  completed,  patients  will be enrolled  in the 
phase  2 portion  of the single -arm, two-stage,  open -label study  of trametinib  and erlotinib  in the 
treatment  of patients  with EGFR -mutant  lung cancers  with acquired  resistance  to erlotinib .  After 
screening  and registration,  patients  will be treated  with the combination  of trametinib  and erlotinib.  
Response  to therapy  will be assessed  by [CONTACT_390117]  8 weeks  (every  2 cycles)  with CT 
scan  of the chest  and imaging  of any other  target  lesion  with response  evaluated  by [CONTACT_393]  1.1. 
A maximum of 24 patients  will be enrolled  in the phase  2 study.  Dosing  for the phase  2 portion  of 
the study  will depend  on the results from  the run In Phase  1 Portion.  If 0-1 DLTs  occur,  and dose  
level 0 is used  in the phase  2 portion,  the patients  treated  in the phase  1 portion  at dose  level 0 
will be included  in the phase  2 portion.

9.2 Treatment Arms  
 
All patients  will receive  trametinib  and erlotinib  in this single -arm study.  
 
9.3 Study  design  
 
Phase  1 (safety  run-in): This portion  of the study  will assess  whether  a dose  of trametinib  1.5mg  
by [CONTACT_390129]  75mg  by [CONTACT_390116] a safe dose.  Six patients  will need  
to be enrolled at this dose level and assessed for dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) for 1 full cycle (28 
days). Toxicity will be graded according to NCI CTCAE version 4.0. If more than one patient 
develops  a DLT, we will move  on to the phase  2 portion  of the study and the dose  level -1 will be 
used.  Dose  level -1 of trametinib  1mg daily and erlotinib  100mg  daily was already  established  to 
be safe and tolerable  in a previous  phase  1 study.  If <1 DLTs  are detected,  we will move  on to the 
phase  2 portion  of the study at dose  level 0. 
 
Dose  levels  Trametinib  Dose  Erlotinib  Dose  
Dose  Level  0 1.5mg  PO qdaily  75mg  PO qdaily  
Dose  Level  -1 1 mg PO qdaily  100mg  PO qdaily  
 
 
Phase  2: All patients  will receive  erlotinib  and trametinib  at the dose  level defined  during  the 
phase  [ADDRESS_489347] every  2 cycles (8 
weeks).  The first 8 week  response  will be considered  the primary  objective  outcome  for this 
portion  of the study.  The schedule  of evaluations  and interventions  is described  in Section  10.0.  
9.4 Dose  Limiting  Toxicities:  
 
The NCI Common  Terminology  Criteria  for Adverse  Events  Version  4.0 (NCI CTCAE)  will be used  
to grade  toxicities  during  the trial. Dose  limiting  toxicities  (DLTs)  are defined  as any of the  
following  events  occurring  during  the first cycles  of treatment  (i.e. 4 weeks)  that are, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_390090],  possibly,  probably,  or definitely  related  to the investigational  regimen:  
• Death  related  to the investigational  regimen  
• Hematologic  toxicities  including:  
o Grade=4  neutropenia  lasting  >5 days 
o Grade=4  thrombocytopenia  (<25,000/mm3)  
o Grade≥ thrombocytopenia  with evidence  of clinically  significant  bleeding  
o Grade=4  anemia  
• Non-hematologic  toxicities  include:  
o Grade  ≥ [ADDRESS_489348],  ALT, alkaline  phosphatase  or total bilirubin  
o Grade   ≥ 3 diarrhea,  nausea,  vomiting  that lasts >72 hours  despi[INVESTIGATOR_390091] 
o Grade  4 diarrhea,  nausea,  vomiting  
o Any other  non-hematologic  grade   ≥3  major  organ  toxicity  
o central  serous  retinopathy  or retinal  vein occlusion  
9.5 Correlative  Studies:  Biopsies  will be required  prior to start of study  treatment  and at the time 
of progression.  At prespecified  time points,  and after additional  informed  consent,  patients  will

The remaining  cores  will be fixed in formalin  and sent to Surgical  Pathology.  Blood  will also be 
used  for IMPACT   testing  for next-generation  sequencing  based  testing  if not obtained  previously.  
DNA/RNA  will be extracted  from one flash-frozen  core using  an AllPrep®  DNA/RNA  mini kit 
(Qiagen).  RNA quality  will be assessed  at the MSKCC  integrative  genomics  (iGO)  core facility  
using  an Agilent  Bioanalyzer  2100  platform.  We will perform  RNA-seq on all patients  with 
sufficient  tissue  from the phase  2 cohort,  to quantify  changes  in gene  expression  at various  time 
points  of treatment  and to identify  potential  biomarkers  of response  to combination  therapy.  
Extracted  RNA (5ug)  will be submitted  to Genewiz  for single -end 75bp  reads  on a HiSeq  2500  
instrument.  RNA samples  that are limiting  in quality/amount  will be amplified  using  the Ovation®  
RNA-seq System  V2 kit (NuGen)  and submitted  for RNA-seq as cDNA.  We expect  RNA yields  
from core biopsies  to be limiting,  thus we will not perform  rRNA  depletion  prior to submission  of 
samples.  Analysis  of RNA-seq data will be performed  at the MSKCC  Bioinformatics  core facility.  
Remaining  RNA will be frozen  at -80C for validation  of genes  of interest  highlight  by [CONTACT_16638]-seq 
data.  Validation  will be performed  using  either  RT-PCR  or through  the construction  of a custom  
nanostring  nCounter  panel  that includes  genes  of interest.  One fixed core will be used  for 
immunohistochemistry  to determine  protein  expression  for transcripts  of interest,  including:   BIM, 
cleaved  caspase  3, TGFB2,  vimentin,  e-cadherin,  n-cadherin  and neurofibromin.  MSK-IMPACT,  
our next-generation  sequencing  based  mutation  platform  that assesse s for genetic  alterations  in 
340 cancer -related  genes  will be used  for molecular  analysis.

her control  (e.g. clinic  closure,  personal  emergency,  inclement  weather,  vacation)  the assessment  
should  be performed  as close  as possible  to the required  schedule.  More  frequent  assessments  
should  be obtained  if clinically  indicated.  Subjects  will return  to the study  site within  [ADDRESS_489351] dose  of trametinib  and erlotinib  to complete  end of study  assessments  outlined  below.  
Additional  follow  up will occur  for subjects  with AEs related  to study  treatment  that are ongoing  at 
the time of this visit and for subjects  with SAEs  related  to study  treatment  that occur  after the time 
of this visit.

11.0 TOXICITIES/SIDE  EFFECTS  
 
Adverse  events  occurring  in patients  treated  with trametinib  and erlotinib  may be 1) overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_390092]  (i.e. rash,  diarrhea,  and pneumonitis);  2) toxicities  typi[INVESTIGATOR_390093]  (i.e. visual  disturbance,  QTc prolongations)  or 3) toxicities  typi[INVESTIGATOR_390094].  However,  toxicities  with individual  agents  may be potentiated  in the 
combination  or unanticipated  AEs may occur.  The dose  modifications  may involve  one or both 
agents,  and should  be based  on the nature,  severity,  and attributions  of the AEs. General  
guidelines  are provided  below.  For safety  and adverse  event  reporting,  see Section  17.0.  
 
While  AEs may be thought  to be related  to individual  agents  for purposes  of dose  modifications,  
all toxicities  will be considered  related  to combination  therapy  for description  of AE profile.  
 
11.1 Management  of Erlotinib -Related  Toxicities:  
 
Toxicities  with erlotinib  that are likely  (>20%)  include:  
• Fatigue  
• Rash  
• Diarrhea  
• Decreased  appetite  
• Nausea/Vomiting  
 
 
Toxicities  with erlotinib  that are less likely  (<20%)  include:  
• Cough

11.3 Specific  Dose  Modifications  
 
11.3.1  Rash  
 
Rash  is a frequent  AE observed  in patients  receiving  trametinib  and erlotinib  (package  insert).  
Recommendations  for supportive  care and guidelines  for dose  modifications  for rash are based  
on experience  with other  MEK inhibitors  and EGFR  inhibitors.16,17   Patients  should  be informed   
that skin toxicity  is expected  during  treatment  with erlotinib  and trametinib.  Skin toxicity  can take 
the form of dry skin, rash,  acneiform  eruption,  and hair/nail  changes.  Prophylactic  treatment  of the 
skin with the recommendations  below  may prevent  or reduce  skin toxicity.  
 
Patients  with significant  skin toxicity  will be referred  to dermatology  for management.  
Recommended  treatments  may include  topi[INVESTIGATOR_390095]. If needed,  oral minocycline  or oral doxycycline  may be combined  with topi[INVESTIGATOR_390096].  For more  severe  cases,  oral corticosteroids  may be administered.  Patients  who fail to 
respond  to these  measures  may have erlotinib  and or trametinib  interrupted,  dose  reduced,  or 
discontinued.

Guidelines  for Supportive   Care  of Rash  
Type  of Care  Recommendations  
Prevention/Prophylaxisa • Avoid  unnecessary  exposure  to sunlight.  
• Apply  broad -spectrum  sunscreen  (containing  titanium  dioxide  or 
zinc oxide)  with a skin protection  factor  (SPF)  ≥[ADDRESS_489360]  twice  
daily.  
• Use thick,  alcohol -free  emollient  cream  (e.g., glycerine  and 
cetomacrogol  cream)  on dry areas  of the body  at least  twice  daily.  
• Topi[INVESTIGATOR_390097],  starting  on Day [ADDRESS_489361],  and upper  back.  
• Consider  mild-strength  topi[INVESTIGATOR_54059]  (hydrocortisone   1% cream)  or 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_390098]  (e.g., clindamycin)  or oral antibiotics  (e.g., 
doxycycline  100 mg BID, minocycline  100 mg BID).  
Symptomatic  Careb • Pruritic  lesions:  Cool compresses  and oral antihistamine  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
• Fissuring  lesions:  Monsel’s  solution,  silver  nitrate,  or zinc oxide  
cream.  
• Desquamation:    Thick  emollients  and mild soap.  
• Paronychia:    Antiseptic  bath,  local potent  corticosteroids  in addition  
to antibiotics;  if no improvement,   consult  dermatologist   or surgeon.  
• Infected  lesions:  Appropriate  bacterial/fungal    culture -driven  
systemic  or topi[INVESTIGATOR_390099].  
a Rash  prophylaxis   is recommended   for the first 6 weeks  of study  treatment.  
b Patients  who develop   rash/skin  toxicities  should  be seen  by a qualified   dermatologist  and should  
receive   evaluation   for  symptomatic/suppo rtive  care management.

The same  method  of assessment  (i.e. CT or MRI) and the same  technique  (i.e. with or without  
contrast)  should  be used  to characterize  each  identified  and reported  lesion  at baseline  and every  
two cycles  (+/- 1 week).  A designated  radiologist  at MSKCC  will interpret  the study  CTs or MRIs  
according  to RECIST  1.[ADDRESS_489368]/physician  should  perform  the evaluation  
for the entire  duration  of the study.  
Tumor  response  will be assessed  using  RECIST  1.1. Confirmation  of response  will not need  to be 
required.  A CT scan  of the chest  +/- abdomen/pelvis  will be performed  to demonstrate  all known  
areas  of measurable  disease.  The baseline  study  will occur  no more  than [ADDRESS_489369] or MRI. 
All measurable  lesions,  up to a maximum  of 5 lesions  total, representative  of all involved  organs  
should  be identified  as target  lesions  and recorded  and measured  at baseline.  Target  lesions  
should  be selected  on the basis  of their size, should  be representative  of all involved  organs,  and 
should  lend themselves  to reproducible  repeat  measurements.  All other  lesions  (or sites of 
disease)  should  be identified  as non-target  lesions  and should  also be recorded  at baseline.  
Definitions  of response  in target  and non-target  lesions  are described  in table 12.1.  Table  12.2 
provides  overall  responses  for all possible  combination  of tumor  responses  in target  and non- 
target  lesions.  
 
Table  12.1 Evaluations  of Target  Lesions  
Complete  response (CR):  Disappearance  of all target  lesions  
Partial  Response  (PR):  At least a 30% decrease  in the sumo  of the 
diameters  of the target  lesions  
Progressive  Disease (PD):  At least a 20% increase  in the sum of the 
diameters  of the target  lesions  or the 
appearance  of one ore more  new lesions  
Stable  Disease  (SD):  Neither  sufficient  shrinkage  or qualify  to PR 
nor sufficient  increase  to qualify  for PD 
 
Table  12.2 Evaluations  of Non-Target  Lesions  
Complete  response (CR):  Disappearance  of all non-target  lesions  
Incomplete  response/stable  disease  (SD):  Persistence  of one or more  non-target  
lesions  
Progressive  Disease (PD):  Appearance  of one or more  new lesions  
and/or  unequivocal  progression  of existing  
non-target  lesion

Evaluation  of Best  Overall  Response:  The best overall  response  is the best response  recorded  
from the start of treatment  until disease  progression,  as defined  in Table  12.3.  
Evaluation  of Toxicity:  All patients  who receive  at least one dose  of treatment  with erlotinib  and 
trametinib  will be evaluable  for toxicity.  
Progression  Free  Survival  (PFS):  Duration  of time from first treatment  to time of progression  or 
death,  whichever  occurs  first. 
Overall  Survival  (OS):  Duration  of time from first treatment  to time of death.  
 
 
13.0 CRITERIAFOR REMOVAL FROM STUDY 
 
Patients  may withdraw  from the study  at any time.  Other  reasons  for study  discontinuation  include  
but are not limited  to: 
• Change  in patient  eligibility  
• Non-compliance  with the defined  treatment  plan 
• Protocol  violation  
• Investigator’s  decision  based  on patient’s  best interest  
• Withdrawal  of consent  
• Severe,  unexpected  toxicities/side  effects  
• Lost to follow  up 
• Death  
• Progression  of disease  (defined  by [CONTACT_393]  1.1) 
 
For the Phase  1 portion  of the study,  patients  who withdraw  from the study  for reasons  other  than 
DLT without  completing  a full treatment  cycle  will be replaced.  
14.0 BIOSTATISTICS 
Phase  1: Safety  Run In 
Primary  Objective:  To determine  the safety  and tolerability  of the combination  of erlotinib  75mg  
by [CONTACT_390118]  1.5mg  by [CONTACT_390138].  
Endpoints:  Identify  any dose  limiting  toxicities  of the combination.  A dose  limiting  toxicity  is a binary

outcome where  a patient  either  experiences  a DLT or not. DLT is defined  as any of the toxicities  
described  in Section  9 that occurs  within  one cycle  after initiation  of treatment  with erlotinib  and 
trametinib.  
Method:  Up to six patients  will be enrolled  at dose  level 0 (trametinib  1.5mg  by [CONTACT_390139]  75mg  by [CONTACT_390140])  and assessed  for dose  limiting  toxicities  (DLTs)  for 1 full 
cycle  (28 days).  Toxicity  will be graded  according  to NCI CTCAE  version  4.0. If more  than one 
patient  develops  a DLT,  we will move  on to the phase  2 portion  of the study  and the dose  level -1 
will be used.  If <1 DLTs  are detected,  we will move on to the phase  2 portion  of the study  at dose  
level 0. 
If 0-1 DLTs occur,  and dose  level 0 is used  in the phase  2, the  patients  accrued  during  the phase  
1 portion  of the study  will be followed  for response  assessment  and included  in the phase  2 portion  
of the study.  Given  an expected  accrual  rate of 2 patients  per month,  the accrual to the phase  1 
portion  of the study  will be completed  in about  3 months. Two  to six patients  will be enrolled  in the 
phase  1 portion  of the study.

Phase  2: 
 
Primary  Objective: To determine  the ORR  of the combination  of erlotinib  and trametinib  in patients  
with EGFR  mutant  lung cancer  and acquired  resistance  to EGFR  tyrosine  kinase  inhibitors  
 
Secondary  Objective:  To determine  the progression  free survival  and overall  survival  and further  
assess  the toxicity  of trametinib  and erlotinib  
Methods:  A Simon  optimal  two-stage  trial design  will be utilized  to assess  the primary  endpoint  of 
response  rate (RECIST  1.1 CR+PR).  This study  will test the null hypothesis  of 5% response  rate 
against  the alternative  hypothesis  of 25% response  rate for patients  with acquired  resistance.  A 
null hypothesis  of 5% was chosen  because  all eligible  patients  have demonstrated progression  and 
lack of response  to erlotinib.  The most  effective  treatment  for both EGFR  T790M  positive  and 
negative  patients  is afatinib  and cetuximab  which  has a response  rate of 29% but results  in 
significant  adverse  events18. Subsequently,  an alternative  hypothesis  of 25% was chosen  for this 
study.  The design  chosen  has a 10% type I error (falsely  accepting  a non-promising  therapy),  10% 
type II error (falsely  rejecting  a promising  therapy),  for 90% power.   In the first stage  of this design,  
[ADDRESS_489371].  Safety  and tolerability  
will be summarized  using  descriptive  statistics.  The toxicities  and the adverse  events  will be 
assessed  for each  patient  according  to the NCI CTCAE  version  4.0 criteria.  All correlative  aims  are 
exploratory  and will be hypothesis -generating  only.

Given  an expected  accrual rate of 2 patients  per month,  the accrual  to the phase  2 portion  of the 
study  will be completed  in about  6-12 months.  
Correlatives:  For the correlative  studies,  the analysis  is primarily  exploratory  and hypothesis  
generating.  Correlative  studies  will be performed  on all patients  participating  in both the phase  1 
and 2 portions  of this clinical  trial. 
 
 
Method:  EGFR  T790M  status  will be determined  for the biopsy  samples  obtained  at the time of 
acquired  resistance  to EGFR  TKI monotherapy.  The portion  of patients  with T790M  mutation  will 
be calculated  along  with the exact  95% confidence  interval.  The expression  of proteins  such  as 
BIM, TGFB2,  vimentin,  e-cadherin,  n-cadherin,  and neurofibromin  will be quantified  using  
immunohistochemical  (IHC)  staining  in the biopsy  tissue  obtained  and reported  as a proportion  of 
patients  with each  IHC score.  Results  will be summarized  at each  time point using  descriptive  
statistics  (mean  +/- std). Graphical  methods  will be used  to evaluate  the way protein  expression  
changes  during  the course  of treatment.  
15.1 RESEARCH PARTICIPANT REGISTRATION AND RANDOMIZATION PROCEDUR ES

16.2 Quality Assurance 
Weekly  meetings  will occur  to monitor  patient  accrual  and completeness  of registration  data.  
Routine  data quality  reports  will be generated  to assess  missing  data and inconsistencies.  
Accrual  rates  and extent  and accuracy  of evaluations  and follow  up will be monitored  
periodically  throughout  the study  period  and potential  problem  will be brought  to the 
attention  of the study  team  for discussion  and action.  Random  sample  data quality  and 
protocol  compliance  audits  will be conducted  by [CONTACT_2362],  at a minimum  of two times  
a year,  and more  frequently  if indicated.  
 
 
16.3 Data  and Safety  Monitoring  
 
The Data and Safety  Monitoring  (DSM)  Plans  at Memorial  Sloan -Kettering  Cancer  Center  
were  approved  by [CONTACT_40137]  2001.  The plans  address  the 
new policies  set forth by [CONTACT_28643]  “Policy  of the National  Cancer  
Institute  for Data and Safety  Monitoring  of Clinical  Trials”  which  can be found  at:  
http://cancertrials.nci.nih.gov/researchers/dsm/index.html . The  DSM  Plans   at  MSKCC  
were  established  and are monitored  by [CONTACT_40138].  The MSKCC  Data 
and Safety  Monitoring  Plans  can be found  on the MSKCC  Intranet  at:  
http://mskweb2.mskcc .org/irb/index.htm 
 
There  are several  different  mechanisms  by[CONTACT_46463],  safety  
and quality.  There  are institutional  processes  in place  for quality  assurance  (e.g.,  protocol  
monitoring,  compliance  and data verification  audits,  therapeutic  response,  and staff 
education  on clinical  research  QA) and departmental  procedures  for quality  control,  plus 
there  are two institutional  committees  that are responsible  for monitoring  the activities  of our 
clinical  trials programs.  The committees:  Data and Safety  Monitoring  Committee  (DSMC)  
for Phase  I and II clinical  trials,  and the Data and Safety  Monitoring  Board  (DSMB)  for Phase  
III clinical  trials,  report  to the Center’s  Research  Council  and Institutional  Review  Board.  
 
During  the protocol  development  and review  process,  each  protocol  will be assessed  for its 
level of risk and degree  of monitoring  required.  Every  type of protocol  (e.g.,  NIH sponsored,  
in-house  sponsored,  industrial  sponsored,  NCI cooperative  group,  etc.) will be addressed  
and the monitoring  procedures  will be established  at the time of protocol  activation.

Administrative Update 3 : [ADDRESS_489372]  the study  participants.  
Human  Subjects  Involvement and Characteristics:  All patients  at MSKCC  who meet  the 
inclusion  criteria  will be eligible  to enroll.  Patients  eligible  will be 18 years  of age or older  with 
a KPS of 70% or greater.  Both men and women  and members of all ethnic  groups  will be 
eligible  for this trial. Pregnant  and breast  feeding  women  are excluded  from this study.  This 
protocol  does not include  children  because  the number  of children  is expected  to be limited  
for the patient  population  expected  to be accrued  onto this study.  Also the majority  of  
children  are already  accessed  by a nationwide  pediatric  cancer  research  network.  This 
statement  is based  on exclusion  4b of the NIH policy  and guidelines  on the Inclusion  of 
Children  as Participants  in Research  Involving  Human  Subjects.  
Consent  process:  All patients  at MSKCC  who meet  the inclusion  criteria  will be eligible.  
Participation  in the trial is voluntary.  All patients  will be required  to sign a statement  of 
informed  consent,  which  must  conform  to IRB guidelines.  The informed  consent  procedure  is 
described  in Section  18.0.  
Possible  Toxicities: There  are risks associated  with treatment  as described  in Section  11.0.  
 
Benefits:  The combination  of trametinib  and erlotinib  has the potential  to be effective  and 
induce  tumor  response  in patients  with EGFR  mutant  lung cancer  and acquired  resistance  to 
erlotinib.  
Costs:  Patients  will be charged  (insurance  billed)  for physician  visits,  erlotinib,  routine  
laboratory  tests,  and radiologic  studies  required  for monitoring  their condition.  The patients  
will not be billed  for the study  drug,  trametinib.  The research  studies  will be covered  with 
separate  research  funding  and no charges  associated  with research  will be billed  to the 
patient.  Repeat  biopsy  on progression  of disease  on study  will not be charged  to the patient.  
Alternatives: The alternative  to this trial would  be treatment  with chemotherapy  with or 
without  continuation  of erlotinib  or participation  in an alternative  clinical  trial. 
Confidentiality:  Every  effort  will be made  to maintain  patient  confidentiality.  Research  and

The SAE report  should  be completed  as per above  instructions.  If appropriate,  the report  will 
be forwarded  to the FDA by [CONTACT_62680]  
 
 
17.2.[ADDRESS_489374]  be reported  as follow -up to the original  
epi[INVESTIGATOR_199156]  24 hours  of the investigator  receiving  the follow -up information.  An SAE 
occurring  at a different  time interval  or otherwise  considered  completely  unrelated  to a 
previously  reported  one should  be reported  separately  as a new event.  
Information  about  all SAEs  is collected  and recorded  on the Serious  Adverse  Event  Report  
Form;  all applicable  sections  of the form must  be completed  in order  to provide  a clinically  
thorough  report.  The investigator  must  assess  and record  the relationship  of each  SAE to 
each  specific  study  treatment  (if there  is more  than one study  treatment),  complete  the SAE 
Report  Form  in English,  and send  the completed,  signed  form by [CONTACT_87109]  24 hours  to the 
oncology  [COMPANY_001]  Drug  Safety  and Epi[INVESTIGATOR_623]  (DS&E)  department  - Fax: ([PHONE_002]).  
The original  copy of the SAE Report  Form  and the fax confirmation  sheet  must  be kept with 
the case  report  form documentation  at the study  site. 
Follow -up information  is sent to the same  contact(s)  to whom  the original  SAE Report  Form  
was sent,  using  a new SAE Report  Form  stating  that this is a follow -up to the previously  
reported  SAE and giving  the date of the original  report.  Each  re-occurrence,  complication,  or 
progression  of the original  event  should  be reported  as a follow -up to that event  regardless  of 
when  it occurs.  The follow -up information  should  describe  whether  the event  has resolved  or 
continues,  if and how it was treated,  whether  the blind was broken  or not, and whether  the 
patient  continued  or withdrew  from study  participation.

If the SAE is not previously  documented  in the Investigator’s  Brochure  or Package  Insert  
(new  occurrence)  and is thought  to be related  to the [COMPANY_001]  study  treatment,  an oncology  
[COMPANY_001]  Drug  Safety  and Epi[INVESTIGATOR_623]  (DS&E)  department  associate  may urgently  require  
further  information  from the investigator  for Health  Authority  reporting.  [COMPANY_001]  may need  to 
issue  an Investigator  Notification  (IN), to inform  all investigators  involved  in any study  with 
the same  drug that this SAE has been  reported.  Suspected  Unexpected  Serious  Adverse  
Reactions  (S[LOCATION_003]Rs)  will be collected  and reported  to the competent  authorities  and relevant  
ethics  committees  in accordance  with Directive  2001/20/EC  or as per national  regulatory  
requirements  in participating  countries.  
Pregnancies  
 
To ensure  patient  safety,  each  pregnancy  occurring  while  the patient  is on study  treatment  
must  be reported  to [COMPANY_001]  within  24 hours  of learning  of its occurrence.  The pregnancy  
should  be followed  up to determine  outcome,  including  spontaneous  or voluntary  termination,  
details  of the birth,  and the presence  or absence  of any birth defects,  congenital  
abnormalities,  or maternal  and/or  newborn  complications.  
Pregnancy  should  be recorded  on a Clinical  Trial Pregnancy  Form  and reported  by [CONTACT_390143][INVESTIGATOR_18540]  (DS&E).  
Pregnancy  follow -up should  be recorded  on the same  form and should  include  an 
assessment  of the possible  relationship  to the study  treatment  any pregnancy  outcome.  Any 
SAE experienced  during  pregnancy  must  be reported  on the SAE Report  Form.  
Warnings  and precautions  
 
Additional  safety  information  collected  between  IB updates  will be communicated  in the form 
of Investigator  Notifications.  This information  will be included  in the patient  informed  consent  
and should  be discussed  with the patient  during  the study  as needed

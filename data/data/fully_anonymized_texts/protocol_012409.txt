 PRÉCIS 
Background: 
x In the [LOCATION_002], urothelial carcinoma (UC)  of the bladder is the fourth most common 
malignancy in men and the ninth most common in women with an estimated 69,250 new 
cases and 14,990 deaths in the year 2011  
x There is no FDA-approved second line drug for patients with metastatic UC 
x Multiple lines of evidence support targeting angiogenesis in UC 
x In human bladder cancer, overexpression of c-Met/Axl/PDGFR- α or c-Met alone showed 
significant correlation with poor survival  
x Cabozantinib is a new chemical entity that inhibits multiple receptor tyrosine kinases with 
growth-promoting and angiogenic properties.  
x The primary targets of cabozantinib are MET, VEGFR2, and RET

2 BACKGROUND 
2.1 UROTHELIAL CANCER  
In the [LOCATION_002], urothelial carcinoma (UC) of the bladder is the fourth most common 
malignancy in men and the ninth most common in  women with an estimated 69,250 new cases and 
14,990 deaths in the year 2011.1  Worldwide, 386,300 new cases and 150,200 deaths occurred 
from bladder cancer in [ZIP_CODE]. Although UC is a chemosensitive malignancy with response 
proportions of over 50% with conve ntional cytotoxic regimens, the response durations are short 
and the median survival of patients with metastatic disease is approximately [ADDRESS_514889] conventional 
chemotherapy agent(s) have demonstrated a surviva l benefit in patients that have progressed after 
first line platinum-based chemothe rapy.  Second-line trials with cytotoxic agents have generally 
yielded discouraging response rates (see Table 1  below) with a median progression-free survival 
between [ADDRESS_514890]-line therapy leaving few available options for patients

 with progressive or recurrent disease.  This highlights the need for the development of novel 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_408174].

 Targeting Angiogenesis in UC 
Several processes central to tumor progression, incl uding tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis 
are dependent on an adequate blood supply. Angiog enesis, the process by [CONTACT_408222], is orchest rated by a balance of stimulatory and inhibitory factors released 
by [CONTACT_408223]. Over twenty years ago, C hodak et al first demonstr ated that the urine of 
patients with UC contained pro-angiogenic substances 15. Multiple lines of evidence support 
targeting angiogenesis in UC: 
x Microvessel density, a histological measure of angiogenesis, has been correlated with 
stage, recurrence, and survival, in UC. 16,17, [ADDRESS_514891] described increased ex pression of vascular endothelial growth factor 
(VEGF), a mediator of angiogenesis, in the tissue, serum, and urine of patients with UC 
and correlated these markers with stage and prognosis.19-[ADDRESS_514892] shown activity in preclinical murine models of UC.22-24  
x A functional autocrine loop involving VEGF/VEGFR2 may be important in the 
pathogenesis of some bladder cancers. In a recent non-clinical study, 6 of 13 bladder 
tumor cell lines examined expressed VEGF R2 (Flk-1). Further analysis of the T24 
bladder tumor cell line revealed a func tional autocrine loop involving VEGF and 
VEGFR2.25,26 
Clinical studies in bladder cancer with anti-angiogenic agents.  
A phase II study of single agent Sunitinib 27 in 77 patients on one of two schedules (50 mg per day 
for 4 weeks on and 2 weeks off [cohort A], 37.5 mg per day continuously [cohort B]), found a partial response in three of 45 patients in cohort A, and in one of 32 patients in cohort B. Clinical 
regression or stable disease was achieved in 33 of 77 patients (43%) with 29% of patients achieving 
stable disease lasting longer than [ADDRESS_514893]-line chem otherapy reported complete response 19%, partial 
response 53%; with overall response rate of 72%. St able disease lasting greater than 12 weeks was

 observed in 9%.  With a median follow-up of 27 .2 months (range, 3.5 to 40.9 months), median 
progression-free survival (PFS) was 8.2 months (95% CI, 6.8 to 10.3 months) with a median 
overall survival (OS) time of 19.1 months (95% CI, 12.4 to 22.7 months).  This combination demonstrates significant clinical activity in the first-line treatment of metastatic UC patients. A 
phase III trial to further define  the toxicity risk vs. clinical benefit of bevacizumab addition to 
platinum-based doublets is currently ongoing in this population. 
Met expression in Bladder Cancer 
The c-met proto-oncogene encodes a receptor tyrosine  kinase (Met) and has been shown to play a 
role in oncogenesis. High titers of hepatocyte gr owth factor, the specific ligand for Met, are 
excreted in the urine and tend to reflect disease activity of bladder cancer. The clinical significance 
of Met in human bladder cancer was examined in  bladder cancer cell lines and human bladder 
cancer tumors. The mRNA expression and genomic al teration of c-met was studied in five bladder 
cancer cell lines. Met overexpression was then compared with p53 nuclear accumulation (TP53) 
in primary bladder cancer (n = 142 patients). Expression of c-met tended to correlate with 
differentiation of cancer cell lines in the ab sence of point mutations. Expression of Met was 
positively associated with histologic grade, st age classification, tumor size, and nodular tumor 
growth (P <.05, respectively). Indicators for poor long-term survival were invasive cancer, 
multiple tumors, and Met overexpression (P =.0006, .01, and.04, respectively). In these studies, the c-met proto-oncogene demonstrated that it play s an important role in the progression of bladder 
carcinogenesis
28. 
The clinical significance of the expression of phosphor ylated c-Met in bladder cancer, and its 
correlation with cancer cell progression-related mol ecules has also been investigated by [CONTACT_408224].29. The expression levels of 2 tyrosine residues of c-Met (pY1234/1235 and pY1349) were 
examined immunohistochemically (IHC) in 133 sp ecimens with non-metastatic bladder cancer and 
their correlation with matrix metalloproteinase –1, –2, –7, and –14; urokinase-type plasminogen 
activator; E-cadherin; CD44 standard, variant 3, a nd variant 6; and vascular endothelial growth 
factor. Expression of phosphorylated c-Met was detected in cancer cells, but was rare in normal urothelial cells. c-Met, pY1349 was associated with  high pathologic T stage in a multivariate 
analysis. Expression of pY1349 c-Met was a marker of metastasis and (P = .001) and cause-specific survival (P = .003). Expressions of matrix metalloproteinase –2, matrix metalloproteinase –
7, and E-cadherin correlated with pY1349 c-Me t expression. This demonstrates that pY1349 c-
Met plays an important role in tumor development,  and its expression is a significant predictor of 
metastasis and survival of patients with bladder cancer.  
A study using antibody arrays that selected antib odies against targets differentially expressed in 
bladder tumors, found serum protein, c-met, to be t op ranked at identifying bladder cancer patients 
from controls
30.  C-met expression was validated by [CONTACT_408225] (n = 173) and was associated with pathological stage and tumor grade 
(p<0.001), and over-all survival (P=0.044). 
NIH-Met5 and T24-Met3 cell lines harboring an inducible human c-Met gene were established. 
C-Met-related receptor tyrosine kinases were screened by [CONTACT_408226]. The potential 
clinical importance was examined in a cohort of 65 cases of locally advanced and metastatic 
bladder cancer patients.  A positive association of Axl or platelet-derived growth factor receptor-
alpha (PDGFR- α) with c -Met expression was demonstrated at translational level, and confirmed 
by [CONTACT_408227]-down. The transactivation of c-Met on Axl or PDGFR- α in vitr o was 
Abbreviated Title: Ph 2 XL184 in ur othelial CA  CTEP Study #: 9236 
Version Date: 05/10/2019 
11 
 through a ras- and Src-independent activation of  mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular 
signal-regulated kinase (MEK/ERK) pathway. In human bladder cancer, co-expression of these 
receptor tyrosine kinases was associated with  poor patient survival (p < 0.05), and overexpression 
of c-Met/Axl/PDGFR-α  or c-Met alone showed the most signif icant correlation with poor survival 
(p < 0.01)31. 
C-Met Inhibitor in Bladder Cancer Cell Lines 
Met overexpression occurs in bladder cancer28,29,31,32. The effects of a small, orally available, 
highly selective Met tyrosine kinase inhibit or, PF-2341066, was studied in a pre-clinical model of 
bladder cancer. Bladder cancer cell lines (HT 1376, T24 and TCC-sup) were treated with PF-
2341066 to determine its effects on cellular prolifer ation and migration. Migration was inhibited 
in a dose dependent manner when the cells were  treated with PF-2341066 (Bottaro, NCI, UOB, 
unpublished).  
Dual Targeting VEGF and C-MET 
Hypoxia has been shown to result in the upre gulation of both MET and VEGF, and activated MET 
can indirectly promote angiogenesis and tumor growth by [CONTACT_408228] 33,34. 
Evidence from the literature 34 also supports cooperative roles for MET and VEGFR2 in the 
proliferation and survival of the tumor endothelium. Thus, simultaneous inhibition of both MET and VEGFR2 should result in near-complete inhi bition of major survival pathways that are induced 
in tumors by [CONTACT_68413].  
2.2 IND
 AGENT - CABOZANTINIB (XL184)   
XL184 (cabozantinib) inhibits multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) implicated in tumor 
growth, metastasis, and angiogenesis (Investigator’s Brochure, 2011).  The primary targets of 
XL184 are MET (c-MET) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2); additional 
targets include RET, AXL, KIT, and TIE-2.  Bo th c-Met and VEGFR2 are important mediators of 
tumor growth and tumor angiogenesis, and in  vivo  pharmacodynamic activity of XL184 against c-
Met and VEGFR2 has been demonstrated in both preclinical and clinical studies.  
RTKs regulate many processes including cell growth and survival, organ morphogenesis, neovascularization, and tissue repair
35.  Dysregulation of RTKs by [CONTACT_147844], gene rearrangement, 
gene amplification, and overexpression of both re ceptor and ligand has been implicated as 
causative factors in the development and progression of numerous human cancers. 
The RTK c-Met, encodes the high-affinity recepto r for hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) or scatter 
factor (SF)35.  c-Met and HGF are each required for normal mammalian development and have 
been shown to be important in cell migrati on, morphogenic differentiation, and organization of 
three-dimensional tubular structures (e.g., renal tubular cells, gland formation, etc.), as well as cell 
growth, angiogenesis, and tumor invasiveness an d metastasis.  Upregulation of MET is found in a 
wide range of malignancies including thyroid, prostate, ovarian, lung, and breast cancers, and is 
associated with more aggr essive and invasive phe notypes of cancer cells in vitro  and metastases 
in vivo (Investigator’s Brochure, 2011).  c -Met-driven metastasis may be exacerbated by a number 
of factors, including tumor hypoxia caused by [CONTACT_408229]. 
Evidence linking c-Met and HGF as causative or  progression factors in human cancers include:  
(1) the overexpression of both receptor and ligand in neoplasms relative to surrounding tissues; (2) 
the correlation of receptor and ligand overexpression with disease severity and outcome; (3)

 genetic alteration of c-Met by [CONTACT_408230]; (4) 
introduction of c-Met and HGF (or mutant c-Met) into cell lines, conferred the properties of 
tumorigenicity and metastatic propensity on engineered cells; (5) introduction of c-Met or HGF as 
transgenes into the germline of mice resulted in primary and secondary neoplasms; and (6) the 
inhibition of c-Met or HGF function with dominant-negative receptors, antibody antagonists (both Met and HGF), and biologic antagonists (e.g., NK 4) have reversed cancer-associated phenotypes 
such as motility, invasion and proliferation of tu mor cells, and tumor growth and dissemination in 
vivo
35. 
A wide variety of human cancers, including brai n, colorectal, gastric, and lung, demonstrate 
dysregulated c-Met activity36, either by [CONTACT_3553] c-Met kinase overexpression37, activating c-Met 
gene mutations and/or amplification37-39, or increased autocrine and/or paracrine secretion of the 
c-Met ligand, HGF/SF.  These alterations have  been implicated in tumor progression and 
metastasis, and a high constitutive activation of  c-Met has been correlated with poor clinical 
prognosis40. 
VEGFR2 is the predominant mediator of VE GF-stimulated endothelial cell migration, 
proliferation, survival, and enhanced vascular permeability41.  Increased expression of VEGFR2, 
often in combination with VEGFR3, has been obse rved in the tumor vascular endothelium in most 
common human solid tumor types, on tumor cells in melanoma and hematological malignancies, and in colitis-associated colon cancer
42.  High VEGFR2 expression is an unfavorable prognostic 
biomarker in hepatocellular carcinoma (H CC), and correlated with triple-negative ( i.e., therapy-
resistant) breast cancer and poor survival. 
Nonclinical Development of XL184   
In Vivo  Activity 
Inhibition of VEGF signaling pathway was previously shown to result in more invasive tumors in 
the transgenic RIP-Tag2 mouse model of pancre atic neuroendocrine cancer that spontaneously 
develops aggressive tumors43.  In RIP-Tag2 transgenic mice, tumors treated with XL184 were 
smaller ( P <0.05) than in mice treated with vehicle or an anti-VEGF antibody, but were also less 
invasive ( P <0.05) and had no liver metastases 44.  All mice treated with XL184 (n = 6) survived 
until 20 weeks, but none treated with vehicle (n = 14) or anti-VEGF antibody (n = 8) reached that 
endpoint.  Tumor vascularity decrea sed after treatment, with reductions ranging from 67% at 3 
mg/kg to 83% at 30 mg/kg for 7 days 45.  Tumors were 35% smaller after XL184 treatment than 
corresponding values for vehicle control mice.  c-Met protein expression in tumors was slightly 
decreased, but phosphorylated c-Met was markedly reduced after treatment for 7 days.   
Mice bearing MDA-MB-231 cells (expressing MET and VEGF) were administered four oral doses 
of 100 mg/kg 46.  XL184 increased tumor hypoxia (13-fold) and apoptosis (TUNEL; 2.5-fold) at [ADDRESS_514894] and se cond doses, respectively, when compared to vehicle-treated 
tumors.  In addition, XL184 disrupted tumor vasculature by [CONTACT_408231].  XL184 trea tment resulted in significant tumor growth 
inhibition of MDA-MB-231 tumors (P <0.001) at all doses (1, 3, 10, 30, or 60 mg/kg) when 
compared to vehicle-treated tu mors.  Dose-dependent inhibition was observed for the 3 and 10 
mg/kg doses ( P <0.01), and complete inhibition was obse rved at the 30 and 60 mg/kg doses.  A 
single 100 mg/kg dose resulted in sustained MDA-MB-231 tumor growth inhibition for ~8 days 
after which tumors began growing at a rate similar to vehicle-treated contro l tumors.  In addition, 
XL184 inhibited tumor growth ( P <0.001) in the MET-expressing rat C6 glioma cell line for all

13 
 doses (1, 3, 10, 30, or 60 mg/kg) when compared with vehicle-treated tumors.  The 3 mg/kg and 
10 mg/kg doses resulted in significant tumor regression (62% and 85%, P <0.0001) when 
compared with predose tumor weights.  Subch ronic administration of XL184 was well tolerated 
in mice and rats with no signs of toxicity, as determined by [CONTACT_408232]/or increasing body weights during the treatment period. 
ARCaP-M is a human prostate cancer model whic h expresses both c-Met and VEGF co-receptor 
NP-1 used in a human prostate tumor xenograft study in mouse bone
47.  ARCaP-M cells were 
injected into the tibia of nude mice on Day 1, a nd on Day 31 animals with established bone lesions 
were randomized to receive XL184 or vehicle daily (qd) for 7 weeks of treatment48. Tibiae from 
vehicle-treated animals exhibited both osteoblasti c and osteolytic lesions, whereas tibiae from 
XL184 treated animals appeared mostly normal.  Thus, XL184 treatment blocked both osteoblastic 
and osteolytic progression of A RCaP-M xenograft tumors in bone. 
 Nonclinical Pharmacodynamics 
In mice, the effective dose resulting in 50% inhibition (ED 50) of targets was achieved at well 
tolerated doses of XL184 and at plasma exposure s comparable to exposure observed in clinical 
trials49.  XL184 produced prolonged inhibition of receptor phosphorylation, such as sustained 
inhibition of c-Met and VEGFR2 for 10 hours afte r administration of a single dose of XL184.  This 
extended inhibition occurred in a manner that was generally predicted by [CONTACT_408233], i.e., 
inhibition was diminished when plasma levels fell below approximately 20 μM for c -Met, 5 μM 
for VEGFR2, and 23 μM for TIE -2. 
Once daily administration of XL184 resulted in significant inhibition of c-Met phosphorylation in 
TT tumors, relative to tumors from vehicle cont rol-treated mice, with maximal inhibition of 70% 
seen at 60 mg/kg49.  Dose-dependent inhibition of phosphorylation of c-Met and RET was 
observed among the 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg dose groups as well.   c-Met phosphorylation was inhibited by a single 100 mg/kg oral dose of XL184, 2 –[ADDRESS_514895] 
dose in H441 tumors (human lung papi[INVESTIGATOR_408175]) that harbor constitutively 
phosphorylated c-Met 
46.  This effect was reversible, as c-Met phosphorylation returned to basal 
levels by 48 hours after treatment.    Nonclinical Pharmacokinetics  
In the various xenograft models, plasma exposures were similar and plasma concentrations in the 
range of 3 to 27 μM were associated with efficacy49.  In rats, plasma concentrations in the range 
of 5 to 15 μ M were associated with maximal anti -tumor activity.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_408176], troug h concentrations as low as 0.1 μM w ere observed at highly 
efficacious doses in mice.  Thes e results were consistent with in vivo  target modulation studies in 
mice which demonstrated long (4- to 10-hour) durations of action, and indicated that continuous 
high exposure was not required to maintain efficacy.   
Dose proportional increases in exposure occurred at oral doses of 3 –100 mg/kg in mice and at 3 –
30 mg/kg in rats49.  In rats, the oral bioavailability of XL184 dosed as a solid was approximately 
100% of XL184 dosed as a liquid.  In comparison, oral bioavailability was much lower in dogs 
(20%) and monkeys (18%) for the solid versus liquid dosage forms.

 Systemic drug exposure parameters (max imum plasma concentration [C max] and area under the 
time-concentration curve from [ADDRESS_514896]-dose [AUC 0-t] values) associated with single 
XL184 oral doses in rats increased less than dose-proportionally with increasing dose (100 –900 
mg/kg) 49.  With repeat daily oral dosing in rats, systemic exposure (AUC 0-t values) increased 
generally dose-proportionally following 14 and 178 dosing days (dose ranges 1 –15 mg/kg/day and 
0.1–1 mg/kg/day, respectively).  The C max and AUC 0-t values in rats administered 100 mg/kg were 
approximately 2-fold and 3-fold higher, respectively , than for dogs given 2000 mg/kg; therefore, 
the higher systemic exposure to XL184 in rats correlated with the greater toxicity observed in this 
species at lower administered doses. 
Systemic drug exposure parameters (C max and AUC 0-t values) associated with single XL184 oral 
doses in dogs increased less than dose-proportionally with increasing XL184 dose (400 –2000 
mg/kg), suggesting possible saturation of systemic absorption 48.  With repeat daily dosing, 
exposure (C max and AUC 0-24 values) both increased greater th an dose-proportionally from 10 to 
100 mg/kg and less than dose proportionally from 100 to 1000 mg/kg following 14 dosing days.   
 
Toxicology 
In rodents and non-rodents, histopathological chan ges associated with XL184 administration were 
observed in gastrointestinal (GI) tract, bone ma rrow, lymphoid tissues, kidney, and adrenal and 
reproductive tract tissues 48.  Histopathological changes present  in the bone and pancreas were 
considered secondary to XL184 administration. Adverse effects following oral exposure to XL184 
were generally dose-related, clinically monitora ble, and self-resolving upon discontinuation of 
dosing. In 6-month chronic toxicity studies, treatment-related changes were present only in kidney 
(rats) and reproductive tissues (dog).  In reproductive/developmental toxicity studies, XL184 
administration resulted in  decreased fertility in male and female rats, in embryotoxicity when given 
to pregnant rats, and in a visceral tissue malf ormation (small spleen) when given to pregnant 
rabbits. The no-observable-adverse-effect-l evels (NOAELs) for the chronic toxicity and 
reproductive/developmental toxicity studies occurred at plasma exposures (AUC) below steady-state values measured in subjects with solid tumors administered 175 mg XL184 capsule form 
daily (Study XL184-001). 
In definitive genotoxicity bioassays, XL184 was negative in an S. typhimurium/E.coli  bacterial 
mutagenicity study, an in vitro  chromosome aberration study using human peripheral blood 
lymphocytes, and an in vivo  mouse bone marrow micronucleus study
49.  In safety pharmacology 
studies, no adverse effects occurred on neurobehav ioral or respi[INVESTIGATOR_408177]184-treated 
rats or on cardiovascular function in XL184-treated dogs. 
 
Clinical Experience 
As of May 4, 2011, [ADDRESS_514897] been stud ied in 12 ongoing Exelixis-sponsored clinical 
trials with XL184 treatment 1) as a single agent at does ranging from 0.08 to 11.52 mg/kg on an 
intermittent dosing schedule, 2) from 25 to 265 mg  (19.7-209 mg freebase equivalent weight) on 
a fixed daily dosing schedule and 3) in combin ation with temozolomide (TMZ) and radiation 
therapy (RT), or with erlotinib (Exelixis Communication, 2011).  The maximum tolerated dose 
(MTD) on once daily (qd) by [CONTACT_1966] (PO) dosing schedule was determined to be 175 mg L-malate 
salt (or approximately 138 mg freebase equivalent weight).

Detailed information for each of these studies, incl uding pharmacokinetic data, can be found in 
the Investigator’s Brochure48.  Safety and efficacy informa tion, from the 2011 Investigator’s 
Brochure, is summarized below.  
 
Phase I Studies 
Study XL184-001 was a phase 1 dose-escalation study in subjects with solid tumors.  Eighty-five 
subjects, across 13 dosing levels (DL) ranging from 0.08 mg/kg qd (using powder-in-bottle [PIB] 
suspension on a 5 days on, 9 days off schedule) to 265 qd (using capsules [25 and/or 100mg] for two, 14-day cycles) were enrolled.  The cap sule MTD was determined to be 175 mg qd
50.  Of the 
35 subjects with medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) and measureable disease enrolled in the dose 
expansion phase, 10 (29%, 95% CI) had confirmed partial responses (cPR) (with a duration up to 
48+ months), 17 (49%) had tumor shrinkage of ≥30%, and stable disease (SD) of at least 6 months 
was observed in 15/37 (41%) of the MTC subjects.   
In Study XL184-002, treatment of subjects with newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GB) consisted of 
cabozantinib in combination with TMZ with or wi thout radiation therapy.  Enrollment has been 
terminated and no clinical efficacy data is pres ented in the 2011 Investigator’s Brochure.  All 
adverse events (AEs) were assessed with respec t to combination treatment and not the individual 
components.  Nineteen patients were evaluate d for AEs, the most common grade 3 or higher 
included neutropenia (21%), thrombocytopenia (16%), leucopenia (16%), and hypertension 
(11%).  Myelosuppression, including prolonged pancyt openia, is a dose-limiting toxicity (DLTs) 
associated with TMZ use.  The frequency at which bone marrow toxicity was observed in this 
study is consistent with the TMZ prescribing information.   Study XL184-[ADDRESS_514898] ([ADDRESS_514899]) or Reference (175 mg 
cabozantinib, dosed as one 100-mg capsule and t hree 25-mg capsules under fasting conditions).  
Blood samples were collected up to [ADDRESS_514900] after each treatment to 
assess plasma cabozantinib pharmacokinetics.  See “Pharmacokinetics” section for results.  
Study XL184-[ADDRESS_514901] (100 mg 
cabozantinib, dosed as one 100-mg tablet) or Reference (100 mg cabozantinib, dosed as two 50-mg capsules), according to a randomization scheme.  Each dosing was administered under fasting 
conditions, and blood samples were  collected up to [ADDRESS_514902] after each 
treatment to assess plasma cabozantinib PK.  See “Pharmacokinetics” section for results.  
In Study XL184-008, subjects with advanced solid tumors  (particularly renal cell carcinoma 
[RCC] and differentiated thyroid cancer [DTC ]) are evaluated for any potential clinically 
significant drug-drug interaction of cabozantinib on the CYP isozyme CYP2C8.  The effect of qd 
dosing of 175 mg cabozantinib and a single dose of ros iglitazone will be evaluated.  In 11 patients 
Abbreviated Title: Ph 2 XL184 in ur othelial CA  CTEP Study #: 9236 
Version Date: 05/10/[ADDRESS_514903] common grade 3 or higher AEs were fatigue (9%), hypophosphatemia 
(27%), blood amylase increase (9%), and hyponatremia (9%). 
In a phase [ADDRESS_514904] was enrolled as of May 2011 at 50 mg PO qd.   Study XL184-202  was a phase 1b/2 trial that evaluated the safety and tolerability of cabozantinib 
and erlotinib administered in combination in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) subjects.  Of 
the 64 subjects enrolled in the phase 1 dose-escala tion portion of the study, all but two had been 
previously treated with and progressed on erlotinib therapy.  A cPR was observed in 5 subjects 
(8%) and 24 subjects (37%) had SD/PR ≥[ADDRESS_514905] common grade 3 or higher AEs in 
the phase 1 portion included diarrhea (44%), fatigue (22%), hypokalemia (11%), decreased 
appetite (6%), dyspnea (14%), lipase increase (6%), hypomagnesemia (6%), and dehydration 
(5%).  Twenty-eight subjects were enrolled in th e phase 2 portion of the study, in which subjects 
who had received clinical benefit from erlotinib and subsequently experienced progressive disease 
(PD), received single-agent cabozantini b or cabozantinib with erlotinib.  AEs ≥grade 3 included 
dehydration (8%) and hypertension (8%).  One pa tient, who was treated with single-agent 
cabozantinib, had a cPR. 
 
Phase [ADDRESS_514906] or second relapse 
were enrolled to receive cabozantinib qd as a sing le agent.  Group A received an initial dose of 
175 mg (Group A), subsequent cohorts (Groups B and C) received an initial dose of 125 mg.  
Forty-six subjects were enrolled in Group A, and a total of 176 subjects were enrolled in Groups B/C.  Fifty-seven subjects experienced one or more serious adverse events (SAEs) that were 
assessed to be related to treatment, including five fatal rSAEs. 
Study XL184-203 is a phase 2 randomized discontinuation tria l.  Subjects are enrolled into one of 
nine tumor-specific cohorts: breast cancer, gast ric/gastroesophageal (GEJ) cancer, hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC), melanoma, NSCLC, ovarian cance r, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, and 
small cell lung cancer (SCLC).  Eligible subjects with advanced solid tumors receive open-label 
cabozantinib at starting dose of [ADDRESS_514907] or second relapse.  Subjects received on e of four regimens: 25 mg qd (Arm 1) continuously, 
75 mg qd (Arm 2) continuously, 125 mg qd for 2 weeks followed by 50 mg qd continuously (Arm 
3), and 125 mg qd on an intermittent 3 week on/1 week  off schedule (Arm 4).  A total of [ADDRESS_514908] experienced an SA E assessed to be related to treatment with 
cabozantinib.  
Study  XL184-301 is a blind trial for subjects with unre sectable, locally advanced or metastatic 
MTC, randomized 2:1 to cabozantinib or placebo.  SAEs reported in Study XL184-301 are: one

 grade 4 reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS), one grade [ADDRESS_514909] 
following asystolic vagal reaction after aspi[INVESTIGATOR_408178], and three SAEs of acquired 
trachea-esophageal fistula (two grade 3, one grade 5). 
Adverse Events 
The clinical studies with XL184 are ongoing and thus  the AE data from the clinical database as of 
March 1, 2011 and May 4, 2011 do not yet include al l SAEs (Exelixis Communication, 2011).  As 
of March 2011, AE data are available for [ADDRESS_514910] been dosed with XL184 ([ADDRESS_514911] udies of XL184 with erlotinib, rosiglitazone, or 
TMZ ± radiation) (Investigator’s Brochure, 2011).  Data from the [ADDRESS_514912] frequent ly (>20%) observed AEs regardless of causality 
were fatigue, diarrhea, nausea, decreased appeti te, constipation, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia 
(PPE) syndrome, vomiting, dysphonia, and hypert ension.  Effects that may be related to the 
inhibition of VEGF, including hypertension, t hromboembolic events, GI perforation, fistula 
formation, hemorrhage, wound dehiscence , and proteinuria, have been observed in the single-agent 
and combination XL184 studies.  The most commonly reported SAEs that were assessed as related to study treatment with XL184 (as a single-agent or combination) were pulmonary embolism (PE), diarrhea, dehydration, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), vomiting, nausea, thrombocytopenia, fatigue, 
wound dehiscence, and PPE syndrome. 
Grade [ADDRESS_514913] been dosed with cabozantinib as a single 
agent (1286) or in combination (118) through June 1, 2012.  There have been 27 grade 5 AEs 
related to study treatment: GI hemorrhage (two  subjects), pulmonary hemorrhage (one subject), 
esophageal hemorrhage (one subject), PE (two subj ects), respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399] (three subjects), 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_44447] (one subject), hemoptysis (one subject), death due to unknown cause (four 
subjects), intracranial hemorrhage (one subject), intestinal perforation (one subject), 
enterocutaneous fistula (one subject), tracheo-es ophageal fistula (one s ubject), esophageal fistula 
(one subject), hemorrhage (two subjects), hepa tic failure (one subject), bronchopneumonia (one 
subject) cardiac arrest (one subject), sepsis (one subject), and diverticular perforation, peritonitis (one subject) (Exelixis Communication).  The initial daily doses of drug in these subjects were 100 
mg (8 subjects), 125 mg (8 subjects), 175 mg (11 subjec ts).  In 2 subjects, the initial dose of 125 
mg was reduced to 50 and 75 mg respectively prior to death. 
Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic analysis of 74 patients in trial XL184-001 showed dose proportional increases in 
maximum plasma concentration (C max) and AUC both for PIB (dose range 0.08-11.52 mg/kg) and 
the capsule formulation (dose range: 125 to 175 mg) (Kurzrock, 2011).  Terminal-phase half-life 
(t1/2,z) values were 59.1 to 136 hours (Investigator’s Brochure, 2011).  After repeat dosing, t 1/2,z 
values (mean ± standard deviation) for XL 184 were 91.3 ± 33.3 hours (n = 23), and apparent 
steady-state plasma levels were reached by [CONTACT_2006] 15 (Kurzrock, 2011).  Steady-state clearance for 
the 175 mg capsule dose derived fr om repeat dose data was 4.2 ± 1.5  L/h.  Patients who received 
175 mg capsules had four- to five-fold higher steady-state exposure (AUC) compared with Day 1 (7.68 ± 2.85 mcg ∙h/mL; n = 23 vs. 41.6 ± 15.3 mcg ∙h/mL; n = 23), indicating that XL184 
accumulated with repeat daily dosing.  There wa s no significant difference in exposure between 
patients with MTC and those without MTC. 
Based on the preliminary PK data from 23 subjects in XL184-005 who completed both treatments, 
after a single oral dose of cabozantinib at 100 mg, the terminal t
1/2, z of cabozantinib appeared to 
Abbreviated Title: Ph 2 XL184 in ur othelial CA  CTEP Study #: 9236 
Version Date: 05/10/2019 
18 
 be similar for both tablet and capsule formulat ions, with approximately mean values of 110 hours 
(Exelixis Communication, 2012).  The median ti me to the maximum plasma concentration (t max) 
was [ADDRESS_514914] 
variability for C max and the area under the plasma drug co ncentration time curve (AUC) values 
were observed for both formulations (coefficient of variation [CV]% C max: 51% for the tablet 
formulation, 61% for the capsule formulation; CV% for the AUC from time zero to the last 
quantifiable timepoint or to infinity [AUC 0-last or AUC 0-inf]: 40-43% for the tablet formulation, 43% 
for the capsule formulation).  The geometric mean C max of the tablet formulation was 
approximately 39% higher than the value obser ved for the capsule formulation.  The geometric 
mean AUC 0-last and AUC 0-inf values for the tablet formulation were also higher (15% and 19%, 
respectively) than those observed for the capsul e formulation.  However, due to the high within-
formulation variability observed, no statistica l difference in exposure between the two 
formulations was apparent. 
Based on the preliminary PK data from 46 subj ects who completed both treatments on trial XL184-
004, a high-fat meal did not appear to alter the terminal t 1/2, z of cabozantinib [mean t 1/2, z : 131 
hours (fed) vs. 128 hours (fasted)].  The high-fat meal significantly increased the median t max to 6 
hours from 4 hours (fasted).  The high-fat meal also significantly increased both the cabozantinib 
Cmax and AUC values by 39% and 56%, respec tively.  The geometric mean ratio of C max fed/fasted 
was 1.39 (90% CI: 1.16-1.67), and the geometric mean ratio of AUC 0-last fed/fasted was 1.56 (90% 
CI: 1.34-1.80).  Based on this result, cabozantinib must be taken on an empty stomach (fasting is 
required 2 hours before and 1 hour after each cabozantinib dose). 
2.[ADDRESS_514915] demonstrated clinical activity. MET 
activation is common in solid tumors includi ng UC and promotes proliferation, invasion, and 
metastasis. For these reasons, co-targeting of the MET and VEGF signaling pathways using 
cabozantinib may represent a promising treatment strategy. 
2.3.2 Rationale for a PFS Endpoint 
Pertinent to the issue of discovering new drugs active in urothelial cancers is that identifying 
clinical benefit should not be limited to response.   Some of the newer "targeted therapy" agents 
approved by [CONTACT_408234]-free survival 
(PFS) and not response rate (e.g., sorafenib in renal cell carcinoma with a response rate of 
approximately 10% but a major impact in PFS and, ev entually, an improvement in survival).  This 
Abbreviated Title: Ph 2 XL184 in ur othelial CA  CTEP Study #: 9236 
Version Date: 05/10/[ADDRESS_514916] at only 2-3 months and response rates are in the 10-20% range.  In a 
second-line trial of weekly paclitaxel in 31 pati ents with progressive urothelial cancer, the median 
time to progression was 2.2 months4.  In an ECOG trial evaluating the epothilone analog BMS-
247550 in patients with relapsed urothelial cancer , the median progression-free survival was 2.7 
months (95% CI, 1.8, 4.1)5.  In a phase [ADDRESS_514917] 
supportive care, the PFS for patients treated with vinflunine was 3.0 months (95% CI, 2.1, 4.0)51.  
Novel therapi[INVESTIGATOR_408179]. 
2.3.[ADDRESS_514918] 12 week s of therapy (51%), this starting dose resulted in 
high rates of pain relief, bone scan improvement, and overall disease control.  
Preliminary data from a separate and ongoing dose-ranging study looking at lower doses of 
cabozantinib in CRPC coupled with results from a retrospective review of the Phase 2 XL184-203 
RDT indicate that lower doses below 100 mg qd ar e likely to retain efficacy while improving upon 
tolerability: 
Preliminary results from an ongoing dose-ranging study: To date, [ADDRESS_514919] cohort (starting dose of 40 mg qd) are evaluable for bone scan response. All [ADDRESS_514920] 
discontinued because of a pathologic fracture. Th is provides preliminary evidence that lower doses 
are pharmacologically active in a pa tient population with advanced CRPC.  
Retrospective review of Phase 2 XL184-203 RDT:  While the overall rate of dose reduction from 
100 mg to 60 mg was 51%, only 14% required an additional reduction in dose from [ADDRESS_514921] dose of 40 mg, which is consistent with an overall improvement in tolerability profile at the 60-mg dose level. The majority (69%) of subj ects with pain at baseline who experienced 
early dose reduction (before Week 6) to 60 mg went on to report pain improvement at Week 6. 
Moreover, 80% of these subjects remained progression-f ree and continued to report pain relief at 
the Week [ADDRESS_514922] 2 weeks of study treatment. As such this study will adopt a starting cabozan tinib dose of 60 mg qd. The goal of this regimen 
is to improve the overall tolerability of cabozan tinib while maintaining efficacy in this patient 
population

 2.4 CORRELATIVE STUDIES BACKGROUND  
2.4.1 Circulating endothelial cells (CEC), circulat ing endothelial progen itor cells (CEP) and 
Circulating epi[INVESTIGATOR_28056] (CTC) 
CEC, CEP and CTC may serve as markers for asse ssment of treatment's antiangiogenic activity. 
CEC, CEP and CTC will be analyzed by [CONTACT_83549].  Mononuclear cells will 
be isolated and run fresh or viably frozen.  Imm une subsets, including MDSC and Tregs, may be 
analyzed if sample permits. 
2.4.2 c-Met analysis by [CONTACT_5203]-time RT-PCR 
The c-met proto-oncogene encodes a receptor tyrosine  kinase (Met) and has been shown to play a 
role in oncogenesis. The clinical significance of Met in human bladder cancer was examined in 
bladder cancer cell lines and human bladder cancer tumors. The mRNA expression and genomic 
alteration of c-met was studied in five bladder cancer cell lines. Met overexpression was then 
compared with p53 nuclear accumulation (TP53) in primary bladder cancer (n = 142 patients). 
Expression of c-met tended to correlate with differen tiation of cancer cell lines in the absence of 
point mutations. Expression of Met was positively associated with histologic grade, stage 
classification, tumor size, and nodular tumor growth  (P <.05, respectively). Indicators for poor 
long-term survival were invasive cancer, multip le tumors, and Met overexpression (P =.0006, .01, 
and.04, respectively). In these studies, the c-met proto-oncogene demonstrated that it plays an 
important role in the progression of bladder carcinogenesis28.  
We hypothesize that the c-Met analysis by [CONTACT_5203]-t ime RT-PCR correlates with the C-met level found 
in the serum and is of prognostic significance.  
2.4.3 IL-8 circulating cytokine levels 
IL-8 is a proinflammatory chemokine, which belongs to the chemokine receptors family and which 
stimulates neutrophil chemotaxis and degranulation52,53. IL-8 is a potent pro-angiogenic factor, 
which has been shown to initiate tumor angiog enesis in xenograft models in which VEGF 
signaling was regulated54. Its expression has been reported to enhance angiogenesis through the 
induction of MMP-9 and to induce metastases of human transitional cancer cell lines55. In animal 
models of urothelial cancer, high expression of IL-8 was associated with a significant increase in 
tumor growth and metastases56 A recent study has associated in creased IL-8 plasma levels in 
xenograft renal cell carcinoma (RCC) models with resistance to sunitinib treatment.57 In the same 
study, IL-8 was overexpressed in tumors from pati ents refractory to sunitinib. Increased expression 
of IL-8, MMP-9, and VEGF in non-small-cell lung ca ncer patients, treated with the oral inhibitor 
of VEGFR2 tyrosine kinase vandetanib, correlated with a higher risk of progression.58  In mRCC 
patients treated with pazopanib, baseline levels of IL-8 correlated with tumor burden,59 and 
different polymorphisms of the IL-8 gene were significantly associated with treatment activity.60 
The role for IL-8 baseline levels as a predictive serum biomarker of sunitinib activity in patients with urothelial cancer was studied and it was found that low IL-8 base line levels were significantly 
associated with increased time to progression.

2.4.4 Genetic biomarkers 
Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes that play an important role in the drug

2.4.5 Angiogenesis Markers 
Plasma levels of several angiogenic biomar kers, including VEGF-A, soluble VEGFR2 
(sVEGFR2), and placental growth factor (PI[INVESTIGATOR_12252]), have been shown to be significantly altered after single agent cabozantinib treatment (Investigator’s brochure). Post -treatment changes in soluble 
MET (sMET), a potential biomarker for MET i nhibition, were observed to be of statistical 
significance in clinical studies. Plasma sample s will be obtained to measure changes in the 
molecular markers of angiogenesis, as well as sMET/KIT before and after administration of the 
combination. The potential relationship between biomarker expression and tumor response will be explored. 
2.4.[ADDRESS_514924] urine and blood from patients on this study in order to determine whether urinary 
hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), urinary soluble MET receptor (sMet), plasma HGF and plasma 
Met levels are biomarkers of bladder cancer (trans itional cell carcinoma; TCC) and/or response to 
systemic treatment with the experimental Met/VEGF R inhibitor cabozantinib. Soluble Met levels 
are determined by [CONTACT_408235]. 
2.4.7 Met expression in tissue 
We will investigate the expression and prognostic role of the receptor tyrosine kinase MET, 
phosphorylated MET, and the ligand hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) in patients with urothelial cancer enrolled in this study. MET, pMET, and HGF expression will be assessed using 
immunohistochemistry. MET, pMET, and HGF will be  correlated with extent of disease, therapy 
response rate, progression free and overall survival. 
Tissue blocks and slides obtained from outside pathology departments will be analyzed as 
available.  Tissue biopsies will be encouraged but done strictly on a voluntary basis.  Biopsies will 
be obtained from primary tumor sites and/or metastatic sites.   
2.4.8 Immune subsets and angiogenesis markers in plasma and tumor tissue 
Circulating and intratumoral immune subsets and other markers of the microenvironment, 
hypoxia- inducible factor (HIF) 1 α and 2α  and other angiogenesis and/or immunol ogic markers 
will be analyzed at baseline and 8-18 weeks after  treatment.  At 8 weeks (after 2 cycles of 
treatment), the potential for biopsy will be discussed with the patient.  Tissue blocks and slides 
obtained from outside pathology de partments will be analyzed as available.  Tissue biopsies will 
be encouraged but done strictly on a voluntary basis.  Biopsies will be obtained from primary tumor sites and/or metastatic sites. 
2.4.9 Imaging with PET/CT and optional PET/MRI:  
Fluorine-18 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed 
tomography (CT) has been approved for imaging in many malignancies but not for bladder cancer. 
A retrospective analysis FDG-P ET/CT in patients with metastatic urothelial cancer demonstrated 
Abbreviated Title: Ph 2 XL184 in ur othelial CA  CTEP Study #: 9236 
Version Date: 05/10/2019

 that it has excellent sensitivity and specific ity in the detection of metastatic bladder cancer63.  FDG-
PET/CT scans may provide better accuracy in clin ical information for directing therapy. We will 
prospectively explore the utility of FDG-PET CT and FDG-PET MRI in this study. 
2.4.10 Comparison of Target Lesion Volume/ Dens ity and RECIST Measurements on CT of 
Metastatic Urothelial Cancer 
At present, conventional imaging evaluation of tu mor burden in metastatic disease is limited to 
axial measurements of select target lesions, which serves as a surrogate assessment for three 
dimensional changes in tumor size. Rigorous quantitative assessment of tumor response to cancer therapy is dependent upon assessment of these three dimensional changes in size. Recent image processing algorithms allow for formal RECIST reporting within clinical radiology reports, as well as tumor volumetric assessment and HU analys is within PACS and radiologist workflow. 
Advanced algorithms allow for rapid SA volumetric and tumor density  measurements that more 
accurately reflect tumor burden/ treatment response compared to single dimensional axial measurements alone. Radiologists and information processing IP technologists can use PACS to 
record RECIST reports that include this informati on as accurate as existing team measurements. 
RECIST and volumetric analysis with data integrated has the potential to improve metastatic lesion quantification over existing reporting standards.  Ability to produce RECIST and volumetric calculations in reports in PACS, RIS and HIS shou ld improve quality of pati ent care in facilities 
treating cancer patients.

urothelial carcinoma.   
The primary objective of the study will be to deter mine the activity of cabo zantinib as determined 
by [CONTACT_408239] (RECIST) version 
1.1. Cabozantinib will be administered orally at a daily dose of [ADDRESS_514951] per section [IP_ADDRESS] for over [ADDRESS_514952] the drug held (drug holiday) as 
described in section 6.2.  
5.1 AGENT ADMINISTRATION  
5.1.1 Cabozantinib 
Treatment will be administered primarily on an ou tpatient basis.  Subjects will be instructed to 
take cabozantinib orally at a dose of 60 mg once daily on each day of a 28 day cycle. If a dose is missed, subjects should be instructed not to make it up on the following day.  Cabozantinib should 
be taken on an empty stomach; patients must fast for 2 hours before and 1 hour following each dose of cabozantinib.  Subjects should be instructed not to crush or chew and to avoid both grapefruit and Seville orange products while on the study drug. 
Patients will be provided a pi[INVESTIGATOR_69642] ( Appendix C ) to track the oral study agents, instructed in its 
use, and asked to bring it with them to each appo intment. A new copy of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_408183]. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_408184]. 
Subjects will be instructed to notify their ph ysician immediately of any and all AEs. Subjects 
experiencing one or more AEs due to the st udy treatment may require a dosing delay or 
reduction(s) in their dose in order to continue with study treatment.  
Reported adverse events and potential risks are described in Section 0.  Appropriate dose 
modifications are de scribed in Section 6.  No investigational or co mmercial agents or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_408185]'s

5.1.2 Study Drug Accountability & Compliance 
All oral self-administered investigational agen ts will be properly accounted for, handled, and 
disposed in accordance with existing federal regulations and principles of Good Clinical Practice.  
The investigator will maintain accurate records of re ceipt of all cabozantinib, including dates of 
receipt (compliance form available in Appendix D ).  In addition, accurate records will be kept 
regarding when and how much study treatment is di spensed and used by [CONTACT_134319]. 
Reasons for deviation from the expected dispensing  regimen must also be recorded. At completion 
of the study, to satisfy regulatory requireme nts regarding drug accountability, all unused 
cabozantinib will be returned to the NCI Clinica l Repository for proper destruction as per the NCI 
guidelines. Drug accountability and subject compliance will  be assessed with drug dispensing and return 
records.

5.2.1 Concurrent Medications/Interventions 
[IP_ADDRESS] Anticancer therapy  
If a subject requires additional systemic antica ncer treatment, study treatment must be 
discontinued.  Local intervention is discouraged un less medically unavoidable.  Subjects receiving 
local intervention ( e.g., palliative radiation) are allowed to cont inue to receive study treatment at 
the investigator’s discretion.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Other Medications 
Subjects must be instructed to inform the invest igators of the current or planned use or all other 
medications during the study (including prescri ption medications, over-the-counter medications, 
vitamins and herbal and nutritional supplements).  It is the responsibility of the investigator to 
ensure that details regarding all medications are documented. 
Bisphosphonates started prior to screening activities  or initiated during the course of the study to 
control bone pain may be used with caution. Colony stimulating factors ( e.g., erythropoietin and granulocyte colony-stimulating factors) and 
pain medications administered as dictated by s tandard practice are accept able while the subject is 
enrolled in the study.  However, colony stim ulating factors should not be administered 
prophylactically prior to the first dose of study treatment.  
No concurrent investigati onal agents are permitted. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Potential Drug Interactions 
Abbreviated Title: Ph 2 XL184 in ur othelial CA  CTEP Study #: 9236 
Version Date: 05/10/2019 
32 
 Cytochrome P450:  Preliminary data from a clin ical drug interaction study (Study XL184-008) 
show that clinically relevant steady-state concentr ations of cabozantinib a ppear to have no marked 
effect on the AUC of co-administered rosiglitazone, a CYP2C8 substrate.  Therefore, cabozantinib 
is not anticipated to markedly inhibit CYP2C8 in th e clinic, and by [CONTACT_151998], is not anticipated to 
markedly inhibit other CYP450 isozymes that have  lower [I]/Ki values compared to CYP2C8 ( i.e., 
CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP1A2, and CYP3A4).   In vitro data indicate that cabozantinib 
is unlikely to induce cytochrome P450 enzymes, ex cept for possible induction of CYP1A1 at high 
cabozantinib concentrations (30 μM).  
Cabozantinib is a CYP3A4 substrate (but not a CYP2C9 or CYP2D6 substrate), based on data 
from in vitro studies using CYP-isozyme specific neutralizing antibodies.  
Preliminary results from a clinical pharmacology study, XL184-006, showed that concurrent 
administration of cabozantinib with the strong C YP3A4 inducer, rifampin, resulted in an 
approximately 80% reduction in cabozantinib ex posure (AUC values) after a single dose of 
cabozantinib in healthy volunteers.  Co-administr ation of cabozantinib with strong inducers of the 
CYP3A4 family ( e.g., dexamethasone, phenytoin, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050],  rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentin, 
phenobarbital, and St. John’s wort) may significantly decrease cabozantinib concentrations.  The 
chronic use of strong CYP3A4 inducers should be  avoided.  Other drugs that induce CYP3A4 
should be used with caution because these drugs have the potential to decrease exposure (AUC) to 
cabozantinib ( e.g., chronic use of modafinil) should be avoided because of its potential to reduce 
cabozantinib exposure.  Selection of alternate concomitant medications with no or minimal 
CYP3A4 enzyme induction potential is recommended.  In addition, caution must be used when 
discontinuing treatment with a strong CYP3A4 i nducer in a subject who has been concurrently 
receiving a stable dose of cabozantinib, as this could significantly increase the exposure to 
cabozantinib.  
Preliminary results from a clinical pharmacology study, XL184-007, showed that concurrent 
administration of cabozantinib with the strong CYP3 A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole, resulted in a 33-
39% increase in the cabozantinib exposure (AUC  values) after a single  dose of cabozantinib in 
healthy volunteers.  Co-administration of cabozan tinib with strong inhibitors of the CYP3A4 
family ( e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromyc in, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, and 
ritonavir) may increase cabozantinib concentrati ons.  Grapefruit / grapefruit juice and Seville 
oranges may also increase plasma concentrations  of cabozantinib.  Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and 
other drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 should be used with caution because these drugs have the potential to increase exposure (AUC) to caboz antinib. Selection of alternate concomitant 
medications with no or minimal CYP3A4 enzyme inhibition potential is recommended.  
Because in vitro studies only assessed the met abolizing capacity of the CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and 
CYP2D6 pathways, the potential for drugs that inhibit/induce other CYP450 pathways ( e.g., 
CYP2C8, CYP2C19, CYP2B6, CYP1A2 ) to alter cabozantinib exposure  is not known.  Therefore, 
these drugs should be used with caution when given with cabozantinib.  
Please refer to the Flockhart drug interaction tables for lists of substrates, inducers, and inhibitors 
of selected CYP450 isozyme pathways (Flockhart 2007; http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/ .   
Protein Binding:  Cabozantinib is highly prot ein bound (approximately 99.9%) to human plasma 
proteins.  Therefore, highly protein bound drugs shoul d be used with caution with cabozantinib 
because there is a potential displacement interact ion that could increase free concentrations of

Version Date: 05/10/2019 
33 
 cabozantinib and/or a co-administered highly protein-bound drug (and a corresponding increase in 
pharmacologic effect).  Factors that influence plasma protein binding may affect individual 
tolerance to cabozantinib.  Therefore, concom itant medications that are highly protein bound ( e.g., 
diazepam, furosemide, dicloxacillin, and propra nolol) should be used with caution.  Because 
warfarin is a highly protein bound drug with a low th erapeutic index, administration of warfarin at 
therapeutic doses should be avoided in subjects receiving cabozantinib due to the potential for a 
protein binding displacement interaction.  
Drugs Associated with QTc Prolongat ion:  Treatment with cabozantinib has been associated with 
a mild prolongation of the QTc interval.  Cauti on should be used when treating subjects on 
cabozantinib with other drugs asso ciated with QTc prolongation (see http://www.qtdrugs.org ).  
Additional QTc monitoring is suggested for subjects who are treated concomitantly with QTc 
prolonging drugs. 
Other Interactions: In a relative bioavailability study in dogs, cabozantinib exposure was not 
significantly affected by [CONTACT_408240]. Nevertheless, drugs such as proton pump 
inhibitors (PPIs) and H2-antagonists produce profound suppression of gastric acid secretion and 
significant increases in gastric pH.  By [CONTACT_408241], PPIs and H2-antagonists may decrease 
cabozantinib plasma exposure levels and its effectiv eness in vivo, resulting in clinically significant 
drug interactions.  The use of PPIs ( e.g., omeprazole, lansoprazole, rabeprazole, pantoprazole, and 
esomeprazole) and/or H 2-antagonists ( e.g., ranitidine, famotidine, and nizatidine) is discouraged 
during this study.  If antacids are not adequate, the use of H 2 blockers is preferred over PPIs (Note: 
Cimetidine should be avoided because of its potential to interfere wi th CYP3A4 mediated 
metabolism of cabozantinib).  Antacids, H [ADDRESS_514955] 2 hours

[IP_ADDRESS] Diarrhea 
Subjects should be instructed to notify their physician immediately at the first signs of poorly 
formed or loose stool or an increased frequency of bowel movements. Administration of 
antidiarrheal agents is recommended at the fi rst sign of diarrhea as initial management. 
Loperamide is recommended as standard first li ne therapy. Alternatively, diphenoxylate/atropi[INVESTIGATOR_342844]. Additional agents to consider in subjec ts with diarrhea that is refractory to the above 
include deodorized tincture  of opi[INVESTIGATOR_342845]

 tolerable levels, a dose reduction and/or dose inte rruption of cabozantinib should be implemented 
as described in Table 2.  In addition, general supportive measures should be implemented 
including continuous oral hydration, correctio n of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities, small 
frequent meals, and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_151947]-containing  products not including cabozantinib, high fat 
meals and alcohol.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Nausea and Vomiting 
Anti-emetic agents along with supportive care are re commended as clinically appropriate at the 
first sign of nausea and vomiting.  A dose redu ctions and/or dose interruption of cabozantinib may 
be required as described in Section 6.1.1 if antiemetic treatment and/or prophylaxis alone is not 
adequate.  Agents classified as having the highest therapeutic index (such as 5-HT3 receptor antagonists) per 
ASCO or MASCC/ESMO guidelines for anti-emetics  in oncology or dexamethasone are 
recommended
66-68. Caution is recommended with the us e of aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_408187]3A4, and nabilone is a weak 
inhibitor of CYP3A4. [IP_ADDRESS] Stomatitis and Mucositis 
Preventive measures may include a comprehensive dental examination to identify any potential 
complications before study treatment is initiate d. Appropriate correction of local factors should be 
instituted as indicated, such as modification of ill-fitting dentures and approp riate care of 
gingivitis. During treatment with cabozantini b, good oral hygiene and standard local treatments 
such as non-traumatic cleansing, and oral rinses (eg, with a weak solution of salt and baking soda) 
should be maintained. The oral cavity should be rins ed and wiped after meal s, and dentures should 
be cleaned and brushed often to remove plaque. Loca l treatment should be instituted at the earliest 
onset of symptoms. When stomatitis interferes with adequate nutrition and local therapy is not 
adequately effective, dose reduction or temporary withholding of cabozantinib should be 
considered. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Hepatobiliary Disorders 
In general, it is recommended that subjects w ith elevation of ALT, AST, and/or bilirubin have 
more frequent laboratory monitoring of these parameters. If possible, hepatotoxic concomitant 
medications and alcohol should be discontinued in subjects who develop elevated transaminases.  
See section 6.1.4 for additional information. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Skin Disorders 
All subjects on study should be advised on prophylactic measures for hand-foot syndrome 
including the use of emollients (Ammonium lactate  12% cream or heavy moisturizer twice daily), 
removal of calluses, avoidance of exposure of hands and feet to hot water leading to vasodilatation, protection of pressure-sensitive areas of hands and feet, and use of cotton gloves and socks to 
prevent injury and keep the palms and soles dry. 
The onset of PPE is variable with paresthesia (tingling, numbness) being the characteristic initial 
manifestation, which can be accompanied by [CONTACT_408242]. PPE advances 
with symmetrical painful erythema and swollen areas (edema) on the palms and soles. The lateral 
sides of the fingers or periungual zones may also be affected. Adequate interventions are required

 to prevent worsening of skin symptoms such as  blisters, desquamations, ulcerations, or necrosis 
of affected areas. 
Urea 20% cream twice daily and clobetasol 0.05% cr eam once daily should be used in subjects 
that exhibit toxicity.  NSAIDS, GABA agonists and opi[INVESTIGATOR_408188]. Aggressive management of symptoms is recom mended, including early dermatology referral. 
Subjects with skin disorders should be carefully monitored for signs of infection (eg, abscess, 
cellulitis, or impetigo). In the case of study treatment-related skin changes (eg, rash, hand-foot syndrome), the investigator 
may request that additional assessments be conducted with the subject’s consent. These 
assessments may include digital photographs of the skin changes and/or a biopsy of the affected 
skin and may be repeated until the skin changes resolve.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Embolism and Thrombosis  
Low molecular weight heparin should be used to establish full anticoagulation in subjects on the 
first occurrence of a PE and/or DV T. Full anticoagulation with warfarin is not permitted and 
venous filters are not recommended. Tr eatment can be restarted at th e discretion of the investigator.  
Subjects should permanently discontinue after a second thrombotic event.  
Although routine prophylactic anticoagulation is not necessary for all subjects, prophylactic 
anticoagulation is allowed for individual subjects at the discretion of the investigator. [IP_ADDRESS] Hypertension

Please see study calendar (section 10) for schedule of the study assessments. 
5.3.1 Electrocardiogram (ECG) Assessments 
ECG assessments will be performed with standard 12-lead ECG equipment according to standard 
procedures. Pre-treatment ECGs should be performed after vital signs are obtained and before any 
blood draws. At any time point, if there is an incr ease in QTc interval to an absolute value > 500 
msec using the Fridericia correction formula , two additional ECGs should be performed 
approximately 2 minutes apart, within 30 minutes. If the average QTc interval calculated by [CONTACT_408243] > [ADDRESS_514958] 
management (eg, dose reduced or withheld, requir ement for additional medication or monitoring) 
or result in clinical signs and symptoms are considered clinically significant for the purposes of this study and will be recorded on the AE CRF. If values meet criteria defining them as serious, they must be reported as SAEs. When an ECG ti me point coincides with other activities, the ECG 
will be collected first, followed by [CONTACT_18651].

 5.3.2 Vital Signs 
Vital signs (body temperature, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and blood pressure and pulse) w ill be conducted at 
regular intervals. Blood pressure and pulse will be measured after the subject has been sitting for 
at least 5 minutes. 
When vital signs are scheduled at the same time as blood draws, the blood draws will be obtained 
at the scheduled time point, and the vitals will be  obtained as close to the scheduled blood draw as 
possible. 
5.3.3 Physical Examinations 
A physical examination will include assess ments of general appearance, skin, HEENT, 
thorax/lungs, cardiovascular, abdominal, ge nitourinary, musculoskeletal and neurological 
findings. Any pertinent findings should be documented either in the subject’s medical history (if 
determined to be prior to  the first dose of cabozantinib) or as an  AE (if new or worsening after the 
first dose of cabozantinib). 
5.3.4 Laboratory Assessments

[IP_ADDRESS] Nausea and Vomiting 
Anti-emetic agents along with supportive care are re commended as clinically appropriate at the 
first sign of nausea and vomiting.  Th e dose modification guidance in Table 6.1.1 should be 
followed. The 5-HT3 receptor antagonists are recommende d over chronic use of NK-1 receptor antagonists 
and dexamethasone (NK-1 receptor antagonists can induce or inhibit CYP3A4, and 
glucocorticoids induce CYP3A4 and thus could lower cabozantinib exposure.  Caution is also 
recommended with the use of nabilone, which is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Stomatitis and Mucositis 
Preventive measures may include a comprehensive dental examination to identify any potential

Cabozantinib treatment should also be interrupted when transaminase increases are accompanied 
by [CONTACT_408251],  and/or elevations of coagulation tests ( e.g., 
International Normalized Ratio [INR]).  Monitori ng of transaminases should be intensified (2 –3 
times per week) and cabozantinib should be held until the etiology of the abnormalities is 
determined and these abnormalities are corrected or stabilize at clinically acceptable levels (INR 
< 1.[ADDRESS_514986], total bilirubin < 1.[ADDRESS_514987], aminotr ansferases ≤ baseline grade).  
Subjects must have cabozantinib permanently discontinued if transaminase elevations are 
accompanied by [CONTACT_152006] (bilirubin elevation >[ADDRESS_514988]), in the

6.1.6 Skin Disorders 
Palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (PPE; also known as hand-foot syndrome), skin rash 
(including blister, erythematous rash, macular rash, skin exfoliation, dermatitis acneiform, and papular rash), pruritus, dry skin, erythema, pi[INVESTIGATOR_408191], and alopecia have been reported 
in cabozantinib-treated subjects.  All subjects on study should be advised to use prophylactic 
measures for skin care.  These measures includes the use of hypoallergenic moisturizing creams, ointment for dry skin, sunscreen with SPF ≥30; avoidance of exposure of hands and feet to hot 
water; protection of pressure-sensitive areas of hand s and feet; and use of thick cotton gloves and 
socks to prevent injury and to keep the palms and soles dry. Subjects with skin disorders should be carefully monitored for signs of infection ( e.g., abscess, cellulitis, or impetigo). 
Early signs of hand-foot syndrome can include ti ngling, numbness, and slight redness or mild 
hyperkeratosis.  Early manifestations include painful, symmetrical red and swollen areas on the 
palms and soles.  The lateral sides of the finger s or periungual zones may also be affected.  
Adequate interventions are required to prevent wo rsening of skin symptoms such as blisters, 
desquamations, ulcerations, or necrosis of affected  areas.  Aggressive management of symptoms 
is recommended, including early dermatology referral. 
Treatment guidelines for PPE related to study tr eatment are presented in the table below. 
In the case of study treatment-related skin changes ( e.g., rash, hand-foot syndrome), the 
investigator may request that additional assessments  be conducted with the subject’s consent.  
These assessments may include digital photographs of the skin changes and/or a biopsy of the 
affected skin and may be repeated until the skin changes resolve.

severity.  Subjects should be instructed to notify investigator immediately if 
severity worsens.   
Grade 2 If tolerable, continue cabozantinib at cu rrent dose.  If intolerable, reduce 
cabozantinib dose to next lower level and/or  interrupt dosing. Start/continue urea 
20% cream twice daily AND clobetasol 0.05%  cream once daily. Add analgesics 
for pain control with NSAIDs/GABA agonists/narcotics if needed. Assess subject 
at least weekly for changes in severity.  If treatment was interrupted (but not 
reduced), treatment may be restarted at the same dose or at one dose level lower 
when reaction decreases to  Grade [ADDRESS_515005] be reduced when treatment resumes. Subjects should be 
instructed to notify investigator immediately if severity worsens.  If severity 
worsens at any time, or affects self -care, pr oceed to the management guidelines 
for Grade 3 PPE.

6.1.[ADDRESS_515007] been observed in clinical studies with cabozantinib; including 
fatal events (please refer to the IB).  Subjects who develop a PE or DVT should have study 
treatment held until therapeutic anticoagulation with  heparins is established.  Study treatment may 
be resumed with a one dose-level reduction in subjects who have uncomplicated PE or DVT and 
are deriving clinical benefit from study treatment.  During treatment with anticoagulants, subjects 
need to be monitored on an ongoing basis for blee ding risk and signs of bleeding.  Subjects with 
life-threatening PE or DVT should have study treatment discontinued unless toxicity can be 
managed and subject is deriving clear clinical bene fit as determined by [CONTACT_408255].  Venous filters ( e.g. vena cava filters) are not r ecommended due to the high 
incidence of complications associated with their use.  Once a subject is fully anticoagulated, treatment can be restarted per investigator judgment at one dose lower.  Subjects should 
permanently discontinue after a second thrombotic event.  Although routine prophylactic anticoagulation is not necessary for all subjec ts, prophylactic anticoagulation is allowed for 
individual subjects at the discretion of the investigator. 
Arterial thrombotic events ( e.g., transient ischemic attack, my ocardial infarction) have been 
observed rarely in studies with cabozantinib.  Ca bozantinib should be discontinued in subjects who 
develop an acute MI or any other clinically sign ificant arterial thromboembolic complication.

6.1.9 Proteinuria 
Proteinuria has been reported with approved drugs that inhibit VEGF pathways as well as with 
cabozantinib.  Any level of proteinuria diagnosed  by [CONTACT_408256] a UPCR 
(mg/dL protein / mg/dL creatinine).  When a UPCR exceeds 2, a repeat UPCR or a 24-hour urine 
protein and creatinine should be performed to confirm the result. Cabozantinib should be 
discontinued in subjects who develop nephrotic syndrome (proteinuria >3.5 g/day in combination with hypoalbuminemia, edema and hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035]) or any other relevant renal disease.  Also, 
given the nephrotoxic potential of bisphosphonates, these agents should be used with caution in patients receiving treatment w ith cabozantinib.  Details of managem ent are described in the next

6.1.[ADDRESS_515012] been reported with approved drugs that inhibit VEGF pathways as well 
as with cabozantinib.  As preventive measures, subjects should be evaluated for potential bleeding risk factors prior to initiating cabozantinib treatm ent and monitored for bleeding events with serial 
complete blood counts and physical examination while on study.  Risk factors for hemorrhagic events may include (but may not be limited to) the following: 
x Tumor lesions with cavitations or tumor lesions which invade, encase, or abut major 
blood vessels.  The anatomic location and characteristics of primary tumors or 
metastases as well as the medical history should be carefully reviewed in the selection 
of subjects for treatment with cabozantinib. 
x Recent or concurrent radiation to the thoracic cavity.  
x Active peptic ulcer disease, ulcerative co litis, and other inflammatory GI diseases. 
x Underlying medical conditions which affect normal hemostasis (e.g., deficiencies in clotting factors and/or platelet function, or thrombocytopenia). 
x Concomitant medication with anticoagulants or other drugs which affect normal hemostasis. 
x History of clinically significant hemoptysis. 
 Cabozantinib should be discontinued in subjects wi th serious and life-threatening bleeding events 
or recent hemoptysis ( ≥0.5 teaspoon (2.5mL) of red blood).  Treatment with cabozantinib should 
be interrupted if less severe forms of clinically significant hemorrhage oc cur and may be restarted 
after the cause of hemorrhage has b een identified and the risk of bleeding has subsided at a dose 
agreed to by [CONTACT_16998].  Therapy of bleeding events should include supportive care and standard medical interventions.  
Furthermore, subjects who develop tumors inva ding a major blood vessel while on study treatment 
must be discontinued from cabozantinib treatment.

6.1.12 Guidelines for Prevention of GI Perforat ion/Fistula and Non-GI Fistula Formation 
GI perforation/fistula and Non-GI fistula formati on have been reported with approved drugs that 
inhibit VEGF pathways as well as with cabozan tinib. Carefully monitor for epi[INVESTIGATOR_408192], especially in subjects with known risk fact ors for developi[INVESTIGATOR_151950]/fistula or non-
GI fistula, to allow for early diagnosis. Such ri sk factors include (but may not be limited to) the 
following: 
[IP_ADDRESS] GI-perforation/fistula: 
x Intra-abdominal tumor/metastases invading GI mucosa.  
x Active peptic ulcer disease, inflammato ry bowel disease, ulcerative colitis, 
diverticulitis, cholecystitis or symptomatic cholangitis, or appendicitis . 
x History of abdominal fistula, GI perforation, bowel obstruction, or intra-abdominal 
abscess 
x Prior GI surgery (particularly when associated with delayed or incomplete healing). Complete healing following abdominal surgery or resolution of intra-abdominal abscess must be confirmed prior to initiating treatment with cabozantinib. 
Additional risk factors include concurrent c hronic use of steroid treatment or non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs.  Constipation indicat ive of bowel obstruction should be monitored and 
effectively managed.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Non-GI fistula: 
x Radiation therapy has been identified as a possible predisposing risk factor for non-GI 
fistula formation in subjects undergoing tr eatment with drugs that inhibit VEGF 
pathways.  In addition, subjects who have undergone extensive surgery may be at increased risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a fistula of th e involved organs Non-GI fistula should be 
ruled out as appropriate in cases of onset of mucositis after start of therapy. 
Discontinue all study treatment in subjects who have been diagnosed with GI or non-GI 
perforation/fistula. 
6.1.[ADDRESS_515014] be interrupted  for any wound healing complication which needs 
medical intervention. Treatment with cabozanti nib can be resumed once wound healing has 
occurred unless otherwise prohibited in specific protocols. Cabozantinib should be discontinued 
in subjects with serious or chronic wound healing complications.

6.1.14 Endocrine Disorders 
Prospective studies of markers of thyroid functions  are currently ongoing in two single-agent 
studies to characterize the effe cts of cabozantinib on thyroid function. Preliminary data indicate 
that cabozantinib affects thyroid function tests (T FTs) in a high number of subjects (see 
Cabozantinib Investigator’s Brochur e).  Routine monitoring of thyroid function and assessments 
for signs and symptoms associated with thyroid dy sfunction is recommende d for subjects treated 
with cabozantinib. Management of thyroid dysfunction ( e.g., symptomatic hypothyroidism) 
should follow accepted clinical practice guidelines. 
Other endocrine disorders such as hypocalcemi a and hyperglycemia, and associated laboratory 
changes, have been observed in less than 10% of subjects.  Monitoring with standard laboratory 
tests for endocrine disorders and clinical examinat ion prior to initiation and during treatment with 
cabozantinib is required. Cabozantinib should be discontinued in subjects with severe or life-
threatening endocrine dysfunction. 
6.1.15 Guidelines for Prevention of Osteonecrosis of the Jaw 
Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) has been reported with use of antiangiogenic drugs and 
bisphosphonates and denosumab in cancer patients.  Additional risk factors for ONJ have been 
identified such as use of corticosteroids, chemotherapy, local radiotherapy, poor oral hygiene, smoking, dental or orofacial surgery procedures, and cancer disease itself.  Cases of osteonecrosis 
have been reported in subjects treated with cabozantinib, the de tails of which are provided in the 
current version of Investigator’s Broch ure.  As a preventive measure, invasive dental procedures 
should be avoided if possible in subjects who have previously been treated with or concomitantly receive bisphosphonates or denosumab. In cases where dental procedures are unavoidable, the risks and benefits of a dental procedure and the ex tent of the procedure as well as the risk of 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_408193] a

6.1.16 Guidelines for Management of Treatment-Emergent Corrected QT (QTc) Prolongation 
Treatment with cabozantinib has been associated with a mild prolongation of the QTc interval.  
Other factors which may contribute to QTc prolongation include 
x Treatment with other drugs associated with QTc prolongation (see 
http://www.qtdrugs.org )  
x Treatment with CyP 3A4 inhibitors (which may increase cabozantinib drug levels) 
x Electrolyte changes (hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia).

abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), sy mptom, or disease, temporally associated with 
the subject’s participation in research, whether or not considered related to the subject’s 
participation in the research. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event Characteristics: 
x CTCAE term (AE description) and grade:  The descriptions and grading scales 
found in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) version 5.[ADDRESS_515025] access to a copy of the CTCAE version 5.0.  A copy of the 
CTCAE version 5.0 can be downloa ded from the CTEP web site 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm .    
x For expedited reporting purposes only:   
o AEs for the agent that are bold and italicized  in the CAEPR ( i.e., those listed in 
the SPEER column, Section 7.1.1 ) should be reported through CTEP-AERS only 
if the grade is above the grade provided in the SPEER. 
x Attribution  of the AE: 
- Definite – The AE is clearly related  to the study treatment. 
- Probable – The AE is likely related to the study treatment. 
- Possible – The AE may be related  to the study treatment. 
- Unlikely – The AE is doubtfully related to the study treatment. 
- Unrelated – The AE is clearly NOT related  to the study treatment. 
7.2.2 Suspected adverse reaction 
Suspected adverse reaction means any adverse even t for which there is a reasonable possibility 
that the drug caused the adverse event. For the purposes of IND safety reporting, ‘reasonable 
possibility’ means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event. A suspected adverse reaction implie s a lesser degree of certainty about causality 
than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug. 
7.2.3 Unexpected adverse reaction 
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is c onsidered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the 
investigator brochure or is not listed at the specif icity or severity that has been observed; or, if an 
investigator brochure is not required or available,  is not consistent with the risk information 
described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current applic ation. "Unexpected”, 
also refers to adverse events or suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned in the investigator 
brochure as occurring with a class of drugs or as  anticipated from the pharmacological properties 
of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under 
investigation.

7.6 SECONDARY MALIGNANCY  
A secondary malignancy is a cancer caused by [CONTACT_437] a previous malignancy ( e.g., treatment 
with investigational agent/intervention, radiati on or chemotherapy). A secondary malignancy is 
not considered a metastasis of the initial neoplasm.  
CTEP requires all secondary malignancies that occ ur following treatment with an agent under an 
NCI IND/IDE be reported via CTEP-AERS. Three opt ions are available to describe the event:  
x Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy ( e.g., acute myelocytic 
leukemia [AML])  
Abbreviated Title: Ph 2 XL184 in ur othelial CA  CTEP Study #: 9236 
Version Date: 05/10/2019

 x Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)  
x Treatment-related secondary malignancy  
Any malignancy possibly related to cancer treatment (including AML/MDS) should 
also be reported via the routine reporting mechanisms outlined in each protocol.  
7.7 SECOND MALIGNANCY  
A second malignancy is one unrelated to th e treatment of a prior malignancy (and is NOT a 
metastasis from the initial maligna ncy).  Second malignancies require ONLY routine reporting via 
CDUS unless otherwise specified.  
7.8 DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING PLAN 
7.8.1 Principal Investigator/Research Team  
The clinical research team will meet on a regular basis when patients are being actively treated on 
the trial to discuss each patient. Decisions about dose level enrollment and dose escalation if 
applicable will be made based on the toxicity data from prior patients.  
All data will be collected in a timely manner and re viewed by [CONTACT_1716][INVESTIGATOR_1660] [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a lead 
associate investigator. Adverse events will be reported as required above. Any safety concerns, 
new information that might affect either the ethical and or scientific conduct of the trial, or protocol 
deviations will be immediately reported to the IRB using iRIS.  The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_131729]. The principal inve stigator will personally conduct or supervise the 
investigation and provide appropri ate delegation of responsibilities to other members of the 
research staff.

Storage:  Store intact bottles at controlled room temperature, 200 to 250C. 
Stability:  XL184 should be dispensed in its original container.  XL184 tablets are stable for up to 
24 hours when dispensed in an open container, such as in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_408200], and are stable for up to 7 days 
when dispensed in a closed container,  such as a pharmacy dispensing bottle. 
Route of Administration:  Oral. 
Method of Administration : Take cabozantinib on an empty st omach, (fasting is required 2 hours 
before and 1 hour after each cabozantinib dose).  Do not crush or chew. 
Potential Drug Interactions : XL184 is a substrate of CYP3A4.  Coadministration of XL184 with 
medications that are strong inhibitors/inducers of CYP3A4 should be avoided. Examples of strong 
CYP3A4 inducers are rifampin, dexamethasone, phe nytoin, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], rifabutin, rifampentin, 
Phenobarbital, and St. John’s Wort. Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors are ketoconazole, it raconazole, 
clarithromycin, indinavir, nefaz odone, nelfinavir, and ritonavir.  Use alternative medications. 
Avoid grapefruit/ grapefruit juice and Seville oranges while participating in this trial. 
In vitro data, XL184 is not a P-gp substrate but may inhibit the P-gp transport activity. 
XL184 is highly protein bound, 99.9%.  Use caution when coadminister XL184 with medications 
that are highly protein-bound (e.g., diazepam, furosemide, dicloxacillin, and propranolol).  Avoid administration of warfarin with XL184 as warfarin is highly protein-bound and has a very narrow therapeutic index. 
Avoid concomitant use of XL184 with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and H
2 -antagonists if 
possible.  The PPIs and H 2 –antagonists decrease XL184 plasma exposure levels and its 
effectiveness in vivo.  Examples of PPIs are omep razole, lansoprazole, rabeprazole, pantoprazole, 
Abbreviated Title: Ph 2 XL184 in ur othelial CA  CTEP Study #: 9236 
Version Date: 05/10/2019 
65 
 and esomeprazole; examples of H 2 –antagonists are ranitidine, famotidine, and nizatidine.  
Cimetidine is a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor.  Avoid using cimetidine with XL184.  If antacids, H [ADDRESS_515035] 2 hours (preferably 4 hours) after taking 
cabozantinib but at least 14 hours before the next dose of cabozantinib if possible. 
Patient Care Implications :  Do not take grapefruit/ grapefruit juice or Seville oranges while 
participating in this trial.  Inform physician and study healthcare team about current medications 
including over the counter drugs, herbals, or nat ural medicines. Cimetidine  or omeprazole is also 
available over-the-counter (OTC).  Do not use cimetidine.   If need an antacid, take it at least 2 
hours (preferably 4 hours) after taking XL184 but at least 14 hours before the next dose of XL184 
if possible.

of the PI. The rationale for an FDG-PET at [ADDRESS_515050] the option of also undergoing a FDG PET/MR the same day of the PET/CT. 
PET-MR is a new technology that has recently become available at NIH.  Unlike PET-CT, PET-
MRI fuses the PET image to an MRI for attenuati on correction.  In order to explore the value of 
this technology the patient may be asked whether they are willing to undergo a PET-MRI after 
completion of their standard PET-CT.  After the pa tient has completed the PET-CT examination, 
they will be offered additional scanning on a PET-MRI scanner located in the CC/DRD 
emphasizing that this is optional.   No additional injections of radioactivity will be administered 
and, because the MRI does not utilize ionizing radiation, there will be no additional exposure to 
the patient.   The patient will be escorted to Radiology.  The post-injection scan time for PET/MR 
will be 2 to 2.5 hours.  Approximately 1 hour of  additional scanning (PET and MR obtained 
simultaneously) will be performed.  Results of the PET-CT and PET-MRI will be compared.

9.1.[ADDRESS_515053] identified the role of hypermethylation in decreasing the expression of 
cytochromes P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) and P450 1B1 (CYP1B1) in tumors compared to matched 
benign tissues. Furthermore, using a data mining  approach on the TCGA data, we have recently 
uncovered yet another enzyme involved in xenobiot ic metabolism, aldehyde oxidase (AOX1), as 
being progressively down-regulated during progression of bladder cancer through various clinical stages (T2-T4). AOX1 is known to play an e ssential role in amino acid synthesis and xenobiotic 
metabolism and metabolizes N-heterocycles and nitrosamines, azo dyes or nitropolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, many of which are known to increase the risk for bladder cancer. 
Importantly, using Tissue Microarrays on 190 BCa patients we confirmed a loss of AOX1 protein 
expression in advanced stages of bladder cancer. Based on all of the above data, we hypothesize 
that xenobiotic metabolism plays a key role in bladder cancer progression, its enzymes like AOX1 regulate tumor progression and xenobiotic metabolites  could function as non-invasive markers to 
monitor tumor progression. Our aims include: 
x Define stage-specific profiles of key xenobi otic metabolites in bladder cancer plasma 
samples. 
x Develop a first-generation multiplex panel of tissue-derived xenobiotic metabolites in 
plasma that correlates with clinical staging of the disease.

annually complete the NIH online Protection of Human Subjects course.  
LABrador creates a unique barcode ID for every sa mple and sample box, wh ich cannot be traced 
back to patients without LABrador access. The data recorded for each sample includes the patient 
ID, name, trial name/protocol number; time drawn, cycle time point, dose, material type, as well 
as box and freezer location. Patient demographics  associated with the clinical center patient 
number are provided in the system. For each sample , there are notes associated with the processing 
method (delay in sample processing, storage conditions on the ward, etc.). 
Sample Storage and Destruction  
Bar-coded samples are stored in bar-coded boxes in a locked freezer at either -20° or -80 qC 
according to stability requirements.  These freezer s are located onsite in the BPC and offsite at 
NCI Frederick Central Repository Services in Fred erick, MD.  Saliva samples will be stored at 
room temperature.  Samples will be  stored until requested by a re searcher named on the protocol. 
All requests are monitored and tracked in LABra dor. All researchers are required to sign a form 
stating that the samples are only to be used for res earch purposes associated with this trial (as per 
the IRB approved protocol) and that any unused samples must be returned to the BPC. Following completion of this study, samples will  remain in storage as detailed above. Access to 
these samples will only be granted following IRB approval of an additional protocol, granting the 
rights to use the material.  
If, at any time, a patient withdraws from the study and does not wish for their existing samples to 
be utilized, the individual must provide a written  request. Following receipt of this request, the 
samples will be destroyed (or returned to the patien t, if so requested), and reported as such to the 
IRB. Any samples lost (in transit or by a resear cher) or destroyed due to unknown sample integrity 
(i.e. broken freezer allows for extensive sample thawin g, etc.) will be reported as such to the IRB. 
Sample barcodes are linked to patient demographics and limited clinical information. This 
information will only be provided to investigators listed on this protocol, via registered use of the 
LABrador. It is critical that the sample remains linked to patient information such as race, age, 
dates of diagnosis and death, and histological in formation about the tumor, in order to correlate 
genotype with these variables.

x Biopsy material remaining from either the baseline collection (see section 9.1.7) or the 
collection at 8 – 18 weeks (see section 9.1.8 ) should be placed on ice or frozen as soon as 
possible after collection.   
In the case that there is limited biopsy material , tissue distribution should be prioritized as 
follows: 
1. Analysis of met expression ([CONTACT_408286]) 
2. HGF and cabozantinib target analysis  ([CONTACT_408287]) 
3. Immune subset analysis (Jane Trepel) 
4. Genetic/Genomic Analysis ([CONTACT_408288]) 
5. HTG Analysis ([CONTACT_408289]) 
[IP_ADDRESS] Processing  
The sample will be processed in the Trepel lab as described in section [IP_ADDRESS].  DNA will be 
extracted from leftover tissue per Trepel lab procedures and will be assigned a unique barcode that 
can be linked to the original sp ecimen collected, annotated with clinical information.  The DNA 
extracted from the samples will be sent to the Dean lab for analysis. [IP_ADDRESS] Site performing the analysis 
Genetic/genomic studies will be performed in  the laboratory of Michael Dean, Ph.D., CCR, NCI 
and HTG Molecular as per section 9.1.11.  [IP_ADDRESS] Shippi[INVESTIGATOR_408207]:

9.4.3 Scope of analysis 
Tumor samples will be used as a source of DNA for genetic/genomic studies.  Saliva samples will 
be used as a source of genomic (germline DNA) fr om the patients to compare with tumor DNA

 for somatic mutations.  Whole genome and who le exome studies may be conducted using the 
material collected.  Studies for the analysis of chromosomal abnormalities may also be performed. 
9.4.4 Confidentiality of medical information/biological specimens 
Samples will be labeled with unique identifiers gene rated in the Figg or Trepel labs respectively 
and transferred to the Dean lab for analysis.  No  patient identifiers (e.g., medical record number, 
patient name [CONTACT_47623]) will be  included with the sample.  [CONTACT_184477]’s lab will create a separa te 
unique sample ID using Labmatrix that can be linked to the clinically annotated identifiers from 
the source labs.  Samples will be  stored in coded, locked freezers in a room that is locked when 
unoccupi[INVESTIGATOR_530].  The storage facility is located in a building that is key card secured.  Raw and analyzed sequencing data will be stored on de dicated server and on a hard drive in the 
investigator’s locked office.  Analyzed data will also be uploaded into the secure Labmatrix 
database. 
Only the PI [INVESTIGATOR_408208]. Investigators conducting the individual 
sample testing will only have acce ss to coded identification numbers and coded patient information 
(i.e. treatment regimens, treatment res ponses, diagnoses, pathology information). 
No personally identifiable information will be released to third parties and samples and data will 
only be shared with other researchers with the permission of the IRB a nd under the proper Material 
Transfer Agreements. 
Sometimes, because a group collaboration or journal policy requires it, a subject’s genetic data 
may be deposited in a database such as dbGaP. Although there is controlled access to such a 
database, such a submission carries theoretical ri sks of revealing the identity of the subject. This 
is discussed in the consent. [IP_ADDRESS] Certificate of Confidentiality 
As part of study efforts to provide  confidentiality of subject information, this study will obtain a 
Certificate of Confidentia lity which helps to protect personall y identifiable research information.  
The Certificate of Confidentiality allows investigators  on this trial to refuse to disclose identifying 
information related to the research participants, shoul d such disclosure have adverse consequences 
for subjects or damage their financial standing, em ployability, insurability or reputation.  The 
informed consent includes the a ppropriate coverage and restr ictions of the Certificate of 
Confidentiality.

Abbreviated Title: Ph 2 XL184 in ur othelial CA  CTEP Study #: 9236 
Version Date: 05/10/[ADDRESS_515067] – SOLID TUMORS  
Patients with measurable disease will be assessed primarily by [CONTACT_200180], abdomen and 
pelvis.  MRI may be used in subjects unable to to lerate contrast.  For the purposes of this study, 
patients should be re-evaluated every 8 weeks. 
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria 
proposed by [CONTACT_459] (RECIST) guideline 
(version 1.1). [ Eur J Ca  45:228-247, 2009] and Prostate Cancer  Clinical Trials Working Group 
criteria (PCWG2)79.  Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor 
lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of  malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST 
criteria. 
11.1.[ADDRESS_515068]: progressive 
disease, early death from malignant disease, early death from toxicity, early death because of other 
cause, or unknown (not assessable, insufficient data) should be considered to have a treatment 
failure (disease progression). Thus, an incorrect treatment schedule or drug administration does 
not result in exclusion from the analysis of the response rate. 
Evaluable Non-Target Disease Response.  Patients  who have lesions present  at baseline that are 
evaluable but do not meet the definitions of measura ble disease, have received at least one cycle 
of therapy, and have had their disease re-evalua ted will be considered evaluable for non-target 
disease.  The response assessment is based on th e presence, absence, or unequivocal progression 
of the lesions.  
11.1.[ADDRESS_515069] one dimension (longest d iameter to be recorded) as >[ADDRESS_515070] x-ray or as >[ADDRESS_515071] be recorded in 
millimeters (or decimal fractions of centimeters). 
Malignant lymph nodes.  To be considered pat hologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph node 
must be >[ADDRESS_515072] scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended 
to be no greater than 5 mm).  At  baseline and in follow-up, only th e short axis will be measured 
and followed. 
Non-measurable disease.  All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (longest 
diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 to <15 mm short axis), are considered 
non-measurable disease.  Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial 
Abbreviated Title: Ph 2 XL184 in ur othelial CA  CTEP Study #: 9236 
Version Date: 05/10/2019 
84 
 effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflam matory breast disease, and abdominal masses (not 
followed by [CONTACT_462]), are considered as non-measurable. 
Note:  Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be 
considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non-measurable) since they are, by [CONTACT_108], simple cysts. 
‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastas es can be considered as measurable lesions, if 
they meet the definition of measurability desc ribed above. However, if non-cystic lesions are 
present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target lesions. 
Target lesions.  All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in 
total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions  and recorded and 
measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be selec ted on the basis of their size (lesions with the 
longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those that 
lend themselves to reproducible repeated measure ments.  It may be the case that, on occasion, the 
largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducibl e measurement in which circumstance the next 
largest lesion which can be measured reproducibl y should be selected.  A sum of the diameters 
(longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated 
and reported as the baseline sum diameters.  If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then 
only the short axis is added into the sum.  The ba seline sum diameters will be used as reference to 
further characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease. 
Non-target lesions.  All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable lesions over 
and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as non-target lesions and should also be 
recorded at baseline.  Measurements of these lesio ns are not required, but the presence, absence, 
or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted throughout follow-up.  
11.1.3 Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease 
All measurements should be taken and recorded in  metric notation using a ruler or calipers.  All 
baseline evaluations should be performed as clos ely as possible to the beginning of treatment and 
never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment. 
The same method of assessment and the same tec hnique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up. Imaging-based evaluation is 
preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_460](s) being followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461]. 
Clinical lesions  Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial ( e.g., 
skin nodules and palp able lymph nodes) and t10 mm diameter as assessed using calipers ( e.g., 
skin nodules).  In the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_6775], including a ruler 
to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
Chest x-ray  Lesions on chest x-ray are acceptable as mea surable lesions when they are clearly 
defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776].  However, CT is preferable.  
Conventional CT and MRI This guideline has defi ned measurability of lesions on CT scan based 
on the assumption that CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_515073] slice thickness greater 
Abbreviated Title: Ph 2 XL184 in ur othelial CA  CTEP Study #: 9236 
Version Date: 05/10/2019 
85 
 than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness.  MRI is 
also acceptable in certain situations ( e.g. for body scans).   
Use of MRI remains a complex issue.  MRI has excelle nt contrast, spatial, and temporal resolution; 
however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which greatly impact image quality, lesion conspi[INVESTIGATOR_3934], and measurement.  Furt hermore, the availability of MRI is variable 
globally.  As with CT, if an MRI is performed , the technical specifications of the scanning 
sequences used should be optimized for the evaluati on of the type and site of disease.  Furthermore, 
as with CT, the modality used at follow-up should be the same as was used at baseline and the 
lesions should be measured/assessed on the same pulse  sequence.  It is beyond the scope of the 
RECIST guidelines to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body parts, and diseases.  Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the image acquisition 
protocol should be followed as closely as possible to  prior scans.  Body scans should be performed 
with breath-hold scanning techniques, if possible. 
PET-CT At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a combined PET-CT is 
not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for us e with RECIST measurements.  However, if the 
site can document that the CT performed as part of  a PET-CT is of identical diagnostic quality to 
a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), then  the CT portion of the PET-CT can be used for 
RECIST measurements and can be used intercha ngeably with conventional CT in accurately 
measuring cancer lesions over time.  Note, how ever, that the PET portion of the CT introduces 
additional data which may bias an investigator if it is not routinely or serially performed.   Ultrasound Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used as a method 
of measurement.  Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their entirety for independent 
review at a later date and, because they are opera tor dependent, it cannot be guaranteed that the 
same technique and measurements will be taken from  one assessment to the next.  If new lesions 
are identified by [CONTACT_408269], confirmation by [CONTACT_12154].  If 
there is concern about radiation exposure at CT , MRI may be used instead of CT in selected 
instances. 
Endoscopy, Laparoscopy The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor evaluation is not 
advised.  However, such techniques may be useful  to confirm complete pathological response 
when biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where recurrence following complete 
response (CR) or surgical resection is an endpoint. 
Tumor markers Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response.  If markers are initially 
above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered in complete 
clinical response.  Specific guidelines for both CA-125 response (in recurrent ovarian cancer) and 
PSA response (in recurrent prostate cancer) have been published [ JNCI  96:487-488, 2004; J Clin 
Oncol  17, 3461-3467, 1999; J Clin Oncol  26:1148-1159, 2008].  In addition, the Gynecologic 
Cancer Intergroup has developed CA-[ADDRESS_515074]-line trials in ovarian cancer [ JNCI  92:1534-1535, 2000]. 
Cytology, Histology These techniques can be used to  differentiate between partial responses (PR) 
and complete responses (CR) in rare cases ( e.g., residual lesions in tumor types, such as germ cell 
tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain). 
Abbreviated Title: Ph 2 XL184 in ur othelial CA  CTEP Study #: 9236 
Version Date: 05/10/2019 
86 
 The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic orig in of any effusion that appears or worsens 
during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease is 
mandatory to differentiate between response or stab le disease (an effusion may be a side effect of 
the treatment) and progressive disease. 
FDG-PETWhile FDG-PET response assessments need additional study, it is sometimes reasonable 
to incorporate the use of FDG-PET scanning to complement CT scanning in assessment of 
progression (particularly possible 'new' disease).  New lesions on the basis of FDG-PET imaging 
can be identified according to the following algorithm:  
a. Negative FDG-PET at baseline, with a positive FDG-PET at follow-up is a sign of PD based on a new lesion. 
b. No FDG-PET at baseline and a positive FDG-PET at follow-up:  If the positive FDG-
PET at follow-up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by [CONTACT_4654], this is PD.  If 
the positive FDG-PET at follow-up is not confi rmed as a new site of disease on CT, 
additional follow-up CT scans are needed to  determine if there is truly progression 
occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal FDG-
PET scan).  If the positive FDG-PET at follow-up corresponds to a pre-existing site of disease on CT that is not progressing on the basis of the anatomic images, this is not 
PD. 
c. FDG-PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar to a biopsy in cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent fibrosis or scarring.  The use of FDG-PET in this ci rcumstance should be prospectively described 
in the protocol and supported by [CONTACT_4623]-spec ific medical literature for the indication.  
However, it must be acknowledged that both approaches may lead to false positive CR 
due to limitations of FDG-PET and biopsy resolution/sensitivity. 
Note:  A ‘positive’ FDG -PET scan lesion means one which is FDG avid with an uptake greater 
than twice that of the surrounding ti ssue on the attenuation corrected image.  
11.1.4 Response Criteria 
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Target Lesions 
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non
-target) must have 
reduction in short axis to <10 mm.  
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.
 
Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of 
target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on 
study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute 
increase of at least 5 mm.  (Note:  the appearance of one 
Abbreviated Title: Ph 2 XL184 in ur othelial CA  CTEP Study #: 9236 
Version Date: 05/10/2019 
87 
 or more new lesions is also considered progressions). 
Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor 
sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference 
the smallest sum diameters while on study.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions 
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non-target lesions and 
normalization of tumor marker level.  All lymph nodes must be non
-pathological in size (<10 mm short axis). 
Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the upper 
normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response
 
Non-CR/Non-PD: Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or 
maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal 
limits.  
Progressive Disease (PD): Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression  of existing non- target lesions.  
Unequivocal progression  should not normally trump 
target lesion status.  It must be  representative of overall 
disease status change, not a single lesion increase.     
Although a clear progression of “non -target” lesions only is exceptional, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_62484], and the progression status should be confirmed at 
a later time by [CONTACT_271619] l (or Principal Investigator). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Metastatic bone lesions 
Two new bone lesions on Na18F PET CT that is associated with characteristic bone changes on CT 
will be defined as progressive disease (PD).[ADDRESS_515075] changes 
will be counted as PD. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Best Overall Response 
The best overall response is the best response reco rded from the start of the treatment until disease 
progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements 
recorded since the treatment started).  The pati ent's best response assignment will depend on the 
achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

11.1.5 Duration of Response 
Duration of overall response:  The duration of overall response is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that 
recurrent or progressive disease or death is objec tively documented (taking as reference for 
progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started). 
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR until the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented. 
Duration of stable disease:  Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment until the 
criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the 
treatment started, including the baseline measurements.

 13 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
13.1 STUDY DESIGN /ENDPOINTS  
The primary objective of this study is to determi ne if patients with advanced or metastatic bladder 
cancer will exhibit responses to XL184. 
The study will be conducted as an optimal two-st age phase II trial (Simon R, Controlled Clinical 
Trials 10:1-10, 1989), in order to rule out an una cceptably low 5% overall  response rate (ORR; 
p0=0.05), in favor of a modest response rate of 20% (p1=0.20). With alpha=0.05 (probability of 
accepting a poor treatment=0.05) and beta = 0.10 (probability of rejecting a good treatment=0.10), the study will initially enroll [ADDRESS_515082]  enrolled. As it may take 
several weeks to determine if a patient has experi enced a response, a temporary pause in the accrual 
to the trial may be necessary to ensure that enro llment to the second stage is warranted. If there 
are 2 to 4 responses in 41 patients, this would be an uninterestingly low response rate, while if 
there were 5 or more responses in 41patients, then this would be sufficiently interesting to warrant 
further study in later trials. Under the null hypothesis (5% response rate), the probability of early termination is 72%. 
Patients with bone-only disease will be accrued and evaluated separately from all other patients, 
as they cannot be evaluated with the same methods or same degree of accuracy as all other patients 
with this disease. It is expected that only 15-20%  of all patients enrolling  on the trial will have 
bone-only disease. The patients which would be expected to enroll while awaiting enrollment of 
the main set of [ADDRESS_515083] CAP (or MRI) and FDG PET and 
will be considered to have favorable results if additional lesions are not noted compared to 
baseline. As this is a small set of patients, the results will be used to determine if a more definitive 
subsequent study in these patients would be warranted. Patients with non transitional cell carcinoma will  be accrued and evaluated separately from all 
other patients.  Because no data for an expected response rate for comparison currently exist with 
regard to this group of patients, this will be an exploratory study. The patients which would be 
expected to enroll while awaiting enrollment of th e main set of [ADDRESS_515084] CAP (or 
MRI) and FDG PET and will be considered to have  favorable results if additional lesions are not 
noted compared to baseline. As this is a small set of patients, the results will be used to determine if a more definitive subsequent study in these patients would be warranted. 
 
13.2 S
AMPLE SIZE/ACCRUAL RATE 
In order to allow for up to 41 evaluable patients plus up to 21 patients with either bone only or non 
TCC bladder, urethra, ureter, or renal pelvis cancer who will be evaluated in separate cohorts, the 
accrual ceiling will be 71 patients.  This will allow enrollment of up to 8-9 patients who may be 
considered inevaluable.  It is anticipated that 2- 3 patients per month may enroll on this trial; thus, 
Abbreviated Title: Ph 2 XL184 in ur othelial CA  CTEP Study #: 9236 
Version Date: 05/10/2019 
94 
 2 to 3 years is anticipated as the accrual period for this study.  Subjects will be accrued into the 
exploratory cohorts (cohorts 2 and 3) for only as long as subjects are being accrued onto the 
hypothesis generating cohort (cohort 1).

13.[ADDRESS_515085] (retrospectiv ely) or second stage of accrual.  The secondary 
endpoint of the assessment of non RECIST imagin g criteria and association with treatment 
response (RECIST) will be analyzed via appropriate non-parametric methods, such as a Wilcoxon 
rank sum test to compare parameters between responders and non-responders. 
Toxicity and safety are also a primary consideration for use of this agent in this population. The 
worst grade of each type of toxicity noted per pati ent will be tabulated and reported according to 
the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria, version 4.0. 
Evaluations of any laboratory and correlative para meters obtained will be done using exploratory 
techniques. Comparisons of parameters between pa tients who do and do not respond to therapy 
will be done using non-parametric methods such as  a Wilcoxon rank sum test. The results will be 
reported without any formal adjustment for multiple comparisons. For the secondary objective of FDG PET scan evalua tion we will examine the change of uptake of 
FDG over time and explore its relationship with response to therapy. Descriptive statistics such as 
percent changes of FDG over time a nd its overall trend in relation to the clinical endpoints will be 
reported.  The data obtained from this study will be used for hypothesis generating and sample 
size planning for the main study. 
13.[ADDRESS_515086] be assess ed for response to treatment, even if there are 
major protocol treatment deviations or if they are inel igible.  Each patient wi ll be assigned one of 
the following categories:  1) complete response , 2) partial response, 3) stable disease, 4) 
progressive disease, 5) early death from malignant disease, 6) early death from toxicity, 7) early 
death because of other cause, or 9) unknown (not a ssessable, insufficient data).  [Note:  By 
[CONTACT_480], category 9 usually designates the “unknown” s tatus of any type of data in a 
clinical database.] 
All of the patients who met the eligibility cr iteria (with the possible exception of those who 
received no study medication) should be included in the main analysis of the response rate.  
Patients in response categories 4-[ADDRESS_515087] a treatment failure (disease

identified ( e.g., early death due to other reasons, early discontinuation of treatment, major protocol 
violations, etc.).  However, these subanalyses ma y not serve as the basis for drawing conclusions 
concerning treatment efficacy, and the reasons for excluding patients from the analysis should be 
clearly reported.  The 95% confiden ce intervals should also be provided.  
[ADDRESS_515089] SELECTION  
Subjects with progressive urothelial carcinoma of the bladder, urethra, ureter, or renal pelvis will 
be eligible for participation in this study.  Indi viduals of any race or ethnic group will be eligible 
for this study.  Eligibility assessment will be  based solely on the patient’s medical status.  
Recruitment of patients onto this study will be through standard CCR mechanisms.  No special recruitment efforts will be conducted. 
14.[ADDRESS_515090] benefit from 
research participation (section  14.4), all subjects ≥ age 18 will be offered the opportunity to fill in 
their wishes for research and care, and assign a substitute decision maker on the “NIH Advance 
Directive for Health Care and Medical Research  Participation” form so that another person can 
make decisions about their medical care in the even t that they become incapacitated or cognitively 
impaired during the course of the study. Note: The PI  [INVESTIGATOR_83859] (ACAT) for evaluation as needed  for the following: an independent assessment 
of whether an individual has the capacity to provi de consent; assistance in identifying and 
assessing an appropriate surroga te when indicated; and/or an assessment of the capacity to appoint 
a surrogate. For those subjects that become in capacitated and do not have pre-determined 
substitute decision maker, the procedures desc ribed in NIH HRPP SOP 14E for appointing a 
surrogate decision maker for adult subjects who are (a) decisionally impaired, and (b) who do not 
have a legal guardian or durable power  of attorney, will be followed.

14.4.[ADDRESS_515091] on symptoms and/or 
survival.   
14.4.[ADDRESS_515092] scans will  cause subjects to be exposed to approximately 
3.2 rem which is below the guideline of 5 rem per year allowed for adult research subjects by [CONTACT_106644]. 
Other Risks 
Additional risks include the possib le occurrence of any of a range of side effects which are listed 
in the Consent Document.  Frequent monitoring for adverse effects will help to minimize the risks 
associated with administration of cabozantinib. 
14.5 RISKS/BENEFITS ANALYSIS

with conventional cytotoxic regimens, the respons e durations are short and the median survival of 
patients with metastatic disease is approximatel y [ADDRESS_515093] has orally 
consented to participation in the tr ial, the witness’s signature [CONTACT_408281] a ccurately explained and understood. 
If new safety information results in significant chan ges in the risk/ benefit assessment, the consent 
form will be reviewed and updated as necessary . All subjects (including those already being 
treated) will be informed of the ne w information, be given a copy of the revised form, and be asked 
give their consent to continue in the study. 
It will be documented on the case report form that informed consent has been obtained.

 16.2 APPENDIX B: PATIENT INFORMATION ON POSSIBLE DRUG INTERACTIONS  
 
Information on Possible Interactions with Other Agents fo r Patients and Their Caregivers 
and Non-Study Healthcare Team The patient ____________________________ is enrolled on a clinical trial using the 
experimental cabozantinib .  This clinical trial is sponsored by [CONTACT_29630].  This 
form is addressed to the patient, but includes impor tant information for others who care for this 
patient.  
Cabozantinib  interacts with many drugs that are processed by [CONTACT_6813].  Because of this, it is very 
important to tell your study doctors about all of your medicine before you start this study.  It is 
also very important to tell them if you stop takin g any regular medicine, or if you start taking a 
new medicine while you take part in this study.  When you talk about your medicine with your 
study doctor, include medicine you buy without a prescription at the drug store (over-the-counter 
remedy), or herbal supplements such as St. John’s wort.  
 
Many health care prescribers can write prescrip tions.  You must also tell your other prescribers 
(doctors, physicians’ assistants or nurse practitioners) that you are taking part in a clinical trial. 
Bring this paper with you and keep the attached information card in your wallet .  These are 
the things that you and they need to know:  
 Cabozantinib interacts with (a) certain specific enzyme(s) in your liver.  
x The enzyme(s) in question is CYP3A4 .  This enzyme breaks down cabozantinib, gradually 
reducing the level of the active drug in your system.    
x Other medicines may affect the activity of th e enzyme.  Cabozantinib must be used very 
carefully with these medicines, or you may need to switch to alternate medications. 
o Substances that increase the enzyme’s activity (“inducers”) could reduce the 
effectiveness of the drug, while substances that decrease the enzyme’s activity 
(“inhibitors”) could result in high lev els of the active drug, increasing the chance 
of harmful side effects. 
x You and healthcare providers who prescribe drugs for you must be careful about adding or 
removing any drug in this category.  
x Before you start the study, your study doctor will work with your regular prescriber to 
switch any medicines that are considered “stron g inducers/inhibitors or substrates of 
CYP3A4 .” 
x Your prescribers should look at this web site http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/  or 
consult a medical reference to see if any medicine they want to prescribe is on a list of drugs to avoid.   
x Please be very careful!  Over-the-counter drugs have a brand name [CONTACT_159964] —it’s 
usually big and catches your eye.  They also have a generic name —it’s usually small and 
located above or below the brand name, and printed in the ingredient list.  Find the 
generic name [CONTACT_159965], with the pharmacist’s help, whether there could be an 
adverse interaction.

 x Be careful:  
o If you take acetaminophen regularly:  You should not take more than 4 grams a 
day if you are an adult or 2.4 grams a day if you are older than 65 years of age.  Read labels carefully!  Acetaminophen is an ingredient in many medicines for pain, flu, and cold. 
o If you drink grapefruit juice or eat grapefr uit or Seville orange:  Avoid these until 
the study is over.  
o If you take herbal medicine regularly:  You should not take St. John’s wort while you are taking cabozantinib 
o For indigestion, take antacid at least 2 hours (preferably 4 hours) after taking cabozantinib and at least [ADDRESS_515100] whenever you need to 
use an over-the-counter medicine or herbal supplement.  
x Your regular prescriber should check a medical reference or call your study doctor before prescribing any new medicine for you.  Your study doctor’s name [CONTACT_78919]. Andrea Apolo and she can be contact[CONTACT_6811] 301-480-

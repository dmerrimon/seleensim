1Clinical Trial of the On-X®Valve Using Low Dose Anticoagulation
I. Hypothesis
Various patient groups with the On-X Valve can be maintained safely on lower doses 
of Coumadin®or on antiplatelet drugs only rather than the standard dose of Coumadin
and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_608194]/AHA or ACCP prof essional societies.
II. Study Design
This is a longitudinal, randomized (randomization to occur at the 3 month follow-up) 
study comparing the On-X valve on low dose anticoagulation (test group) to  concomitant control groups of On-X valves receiving standard Coumadin/aspi[INVESTIGATOR_608195], and also to FDA objective performance criteria (OPC)
[1]. It is a multicenter 
study consisting of up to [ADDRESS_806288] or 
as required by [CONTACT_608252].
A. Patient Inclusion 
1. Patients requiring isolated aortic va lve replacement (AVR), or isolated 
mitral valve replacement (MVR). 
2. AVR patients receiving low dose or antiplatelet only anticoagulation will 
be divided into groups at low risk and high risk for thromboembolism with all patients being in the low risk group except for patients with the following conditions which place a patient in the high risk group:
Chronic atrial fibrillation (see definition below)Left ventricular ejection fraction < 30 %Enlarged left atrium >50mm diameterSpontaneous echo contrasts in the left atriumVascular pathology (see definition below)Neurological events (see definition below)Hypercoagulability (see definition below)Left or right ventricular aneurysm

All patients meeting the criteria will be invited to participate.  
Definitions –
Anticoagulation or anticoagulant –For the purposes of this study anticoagulation shall mean any drug therapy that interferes with the coagulation of the blood whether by [CONTACT_608253] K 
(Coumadin) or inhibition of  platelet aggregation (aspi[INVESTIGATOR_87494]).  
Anticoagulant regime shall be specified whenever discussed.
Chronic Atrial Fibrillation –
Atrial fibrillation that is unresponsive to me dical or cardioversion therapy and that 
has become the primary heart rhythm of th e patient, also called persistent atrial 
fibrillation, having been present in the patient for at least 1 month.
Hypercoagulability –Hypercoagulability in AVR patients will be defined by [CONTACT_608254] y with the patient not
on Coumadin:
1. APC resistance (Factor-V-Leiden mutation) – heterozygous or homozygous2. Prothrombin mutation – heterozygous or homozygous3. AT-III activity – below normal4. Protein C activity – below normal5. Protein S activity - below normal6. Factor VIII activity – elevated above 250%.7. Lipoprotein – above normal
Antiplatelet Resistance (Treatment Failure) –Resistance to aspi[INVESTIGATOR_608196] 1 week (see section III C page 12 for 
enrollment processes):
1. Urine 11 dehydro thromboxane B2 – not reduced after aspi[INVESTIGATOR_259949]  
2. P2Y 12 not reduced 
3Vascular Pathology –
For the purposes of determining AVR risk in this study, vascular pathology shall include any historical evidence of carotid or  peripheral artery occlusion of at least 
50% by [CONTACT_608255], arterial aneurysms, claudication and/or ischemic 
ulcers of the lower extremities.Neurological events –For the purposes of determining AVR risk in this study, neurological events shall include any historical evidence of transient ischemic attack (TIA), stroke or cerebral aneurysm.
C. Test and Control Group Drug Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_608197] –Test Group I (high risk AVR) – First 3- months postoperation, Coumadin at an INR 
target of 2.0 to 3.0 with 81 mg/day aspi[INVESTIGATOR_608198]. After 3-months, Coumadindose will be reduced to an INR target of 1.5 to 2.0 with 81 mg/day of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_608199]. Enrollment in this arm has ceased.
Test Group II (low risk AVR) – First 3- months postoperation, Coumadin at an INR 
target of 2.0 to 3.0 with 81 mg/day aspi [INVESTIGATOR_608198].  After 3-months, Coumadin
dose will be removed and clopi[INVESTIGATOR_608200] a loading dose of 300 mg 
followed by 75 mg/day with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_9601] 325 mg/day. AVR low risk patients who do not pass hypercoagulability or drug response tests will no longer be moved to the high 
risk group. This arm has been closed. See A ddendum A for close out process for this 
test group and its control.
Control Groups – Postoperatively Coumadin with an INR target of 2.0 to 3.0 with 81 
mg/day aspi[INVESTIGATOR_608201].  A se parate control group will be used for each 
test group above.
Mitral Valve Replacement –
Test Group III, (regardless of risk) – First  3-months postoperation, Coumadin at an 
INR target of 2.5 to 3.5 with 81 mg/day (75 mg/day in Italy) aspi[INVESTIGATOR_608198].  After 3-months, Coumadin dose will be reduced  to an INR target of 2.0 to 2.5 with 81 
mg/day (75 mg/day in Italy) of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_608202].
Control Group – Postoperatively Coumadin with an INR target on 2.5 to 3.5 with 81 
mg/day (75 mg/day in Italy) aspi[INVESTIGATOR_608201].
D. Sample Size
A sample size estimate was c onducted based on FDA OPC criteria 
[1].  The study is 
expected to test the safety of low dose (LD) therapy for anticoagulant therapy in On-X valve patients with LD therapy consisting of the use of Coumadin in combination with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_608203]. This study is designed as a non-inferiority study requiring only that LD  therapy is not inferior to standard 
4Coumadin/aspi[INVESTIGATOR_259949].  Testing the superiority of LD therapy with adverse 
event rates as low as expected would require exposure of a prohibitively large patient group.  It was necessary for the sample size calculation to assume an acceptable event rate for the primary endpoints of thromboe mbolism, thrombosis and bleeding events 
derived by [CONTACT_608256]’s.  The incident rate of the sum of these three events needs to be at least as low as th e OPC sum, 7.3%.  Table [ADDRESS_806289] less than 6%/ptyr 
cumulative rate of the three events for the study to reach significance with a 
randomized patient popula tion of between 150 and 250 per group followed for 
between 5 and 6.7 years at a statistical power of 80% with type I error of 0.05 and a maximum allowable difference between groups of 1.5%.  It is expected that each of 
[ADDRESS_806290] the hypothesis, which under the a bove conditions is around 1000 as shown in 
Table 1. Thus the study has 200 patients per gr oup in AVR high risk with an average 
of 5 years of follow-up, or alternativel y 150 patients in AVR low risk averaging 6.7 
years of follow-up and and up to 250 MVR averaging 4 years of follow-up, providingthe approximately 1000 patient-years per group estimated to meet hypothesis.
For the second criterion above, the establis hed rates are the objective performance 
criteria (OPC) given in the FDA guidance document 
(1). The adverse event rates for 
which OPCs are established include the primary endpoints of thrombosis, 
thromboembolism and bleeding and the seconda ry endpoints of paravalvular leak and 
endocarditis as listed below:
Adverse Event % per valve year (R A)

III. Patient Follow-up
A. Endpoints
Safety –
The primary study endpoints are the rates of occurrence of valve thrombosis, thromboembolism, all major and minor bleeding events whether or not related to drug therapy, reoperation, explant and d eath.  Other valve related adverse events 
including endocarditis, hemolysis, hemolytic anemia, paravalvular leak and structural and non-structural dysfunction are secondary endpoints.  All events 
shall be as defined by [CONTACT_608259]/STS guidelines 
[2]for reporting valve study 
results.
10Effectiveness –
Effectiveness endpoints are also second ary endpoints and shall be [LOCATION_001] 
Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification and the echocardiographic hemodynamic parameters of peak and mean gradient and effective orifice area (EOA).  Echocardiographic exams shall also evaluate indexed EOA, performance index, cardiac output, cardiac index and amount and location of any valvular 
regurgitation.
B. Follow-up Regime and Intervals
The intent of the study design is to treat mechanical valve patients with less aggressive anticoagulation.  The control group drug regimes are those from the 
recommendations for mechanical valves of the ACCP
[3]and the AHA/ACC[4],
while test group regimes are either a clopi [INVESTIGATOR_7745]/aspi[INVESTIGATOR_608208]. Patients will be maintained on Coumadin/aspi[INVESTIGATOR_608209], with heparin used from operation until INR target is reached.  Randomization and tran sfer to test group will occur at the 3-month visit.  
INR control will be accomplished using home monitoring with the system provided by [CONTACT_608260].  The patient in c onsultation with his/her physician will also 
make drug dosage adjustments.
Patients will be followed at [ADDRESS_806297] 1-year follow-up for all patients. Visits will be scheduled within 1-month of the appropriate a nniversary.  Follow-up will be conducted by [CONTACT_608261].
C. Investigational Procedures  
The sponsor will provide case report forms (CRFs) or equivalent  electronic data 
management tools to each principal inve stigator for the purpose of recording 
patient data. Assessments will be obtained for the preoperative, operative and discharge period and postoperatively at three and six months and annually to 5 years from the date of implant (Table 2 summarizes the required information at each visit). A follow-up schedule will be pr ovided for each patient based on the 
implant date.
This protocol is designed to be used within the normal daily practice of each 
center.  No specific instruc tions other than those in the labeling are given on valve 
orientation or concomitant drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  This will result in a study that defines complication rates under the various drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].
The investigator will make every attempt to follow the patients and will document 
the information gathered during the follow-up visits on the CRFs. Follow-up

The patients will be encouraged by [CONTACT_608262] y address or telephone 
number changes. They will also be informed of the importance of returning for 
scheduled follow-up visits even if they are not having any problems. All dates within 
the study will be recorded as month/day/year using numeric designators for months. If additional space is needed on any form for any data, the data can be placed on a 
separate sheet and attached to the form.
The study coordinator should submit preoperative, operative and discharge case 
report forms within [ADDRESS_806300] patient confidentiality, the s ponsor will use the information from the 
CRF’s for statistical and device tracking purposes only and will treat medical records 
as confidential as required by [CONTACT_290107]. For this reason, the sponsor is not routinely collecting patient names, but using a study number or initials, 
if necessary, for patient identification; thus better protecting patient confidentiality.  A representative of the U.S. Food & Drug Administration or other appropriate regulatory authority may look at, and perh aps copy, some of the medical records; 
these organizations also have rules for prot ection of patient privacy that they must 
follow.
Enrollment Process and Options -
The following procedures may be used for enrolling patients into the study:
AVR High Risk and MVR Patients
xFrom review of patient charts determine the patient’s eligibility for inclusion in 
either of these two groups.
xPatients that eventually qualify fo r high risk AVR based solely on 
hypercoagulability testing, which must be done preoperatively off warfarin, must 
be recruited preoperatively as described below under low risk AVR.
xAll other patients can be approached for consent either preoperatively or 
postoperatively up to [ADDRESS_806301] the 3 month visit which will start the study for the patient. Change drug 
therapy per the protocol  and randomization result.
Low Risk AVR Patients (No longer active arm of trial)
Determine the patient’s potential eligibility for the low risk AVR group understanding 
that the group may change to high risk AVR pending the results of the hypercoagulability 
and drug response testing described below.  
Completely Preoperative Testing Option
xApproach all eligible patients for inform ed consent, and once consent is given, 
start the laboratory testing program. At this time also enter the patient into the Clinipace database for the assignment of the patient number.
xOrder clopi[INVESTIGATOR_608210].  
This order is for 10 – 75mg tablets to be shipped to the patient’s home overnight.  
The prescription should prescribe a 300 mg loading dose on day 1 and 75mg/day for [ADDRESS_806302] is successfully done. A P2Y12 result of  <35% inhibition 
disqualifies the patient but the full testing should still be done.  A urine thromboxane result of >298 pg /mg disqualifies the patient.
xEnter the shipment information into the Clinipace database and wait [ADDRESS_806303]  arrived properly.  Hint: arrange the 
testing and shipment schedule to occur early in the work week to avoid any 
overnight sample arriving at the lab on the weekend.
xIf samples arrived in good condition, instruct the patient to stop taking the drugs and schedule the operation for at least [ADDRESS_806304] machine order.  The 
clopi[INVESTIGATOR_608211] a 90 day supply with 7 refills the dosing regime is 300mg loading dose on day 1 and 75mg/day thereafter.
xConduct the [ADDRESS_806305] be off warfarin for this testing.  Process all the samples for HRL per their instructions.
xEnter the shipment information into the Clinipace database.  Hint: arrange the 
shipment schedule to occur early in the wo rk week to avoid any overnight sample 
arriving at the lab on the weekend, so keep any frozen samples until Monday if 
drawn on Friday for example.
xComplete the home monitoring prescription paperwork and forward to QAS right away so the insurance qualification process can begin in case it is needed after 
randomization.
xThe patient’s surgery can proceed under normal scheduling plans.
xAt 50 days postoperatively, call the patient to determine that the patient’s INR is 
stable and in target range then orde r clopi[INVESTIGATOR_608212], or the 
local VA pharmacy as appropriate.  This order is for 10 – 75mg tablets to be 
shipped to the patient’s home overnight .  The prescription should prescribe 
75mg/day for 1 week to 10 days (no loading dose).  Instruct the patient to take the drug in this manner.  Also instruct the patient to buy and take 325mg aspi[INVESTIGATOR_608213].  If the patient’s INR is high adjust the Coumadin dose to bring the INR in range before starting clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745].  Also c onfirm that the patient is taking his/her 
antiplatelet medications. It is also recommended that a CBC be done locally to make certain that the patient is not clinically anemic, which could create an inaccurate P2Y12 measurement.
xAt [ADDRESS_806306] within 4 hours.  Also freeze and ship the urine per the HRL
instructions regardless of the P2Y12 resu lt.  A P2Y12 result of <35% inhibition 
disqualifies the patient but the full testing should still be done.  A urine thromboxane result of >298 pg /mg disqualifies the patient.
xEnter the shipment information into the Clinipace database . In 24 hours the lab 
should respond that the sample has arrived properly.  Hint: arrange the testing and shipment schedule to occur early in the wo rk week to avoid any overnight sample 
arriving at the lab on the weekend.
xRandomize the patient [ADDRESS_806307] machine order.  The 
clopi[INVESTIGATOR_608211] a 90 day supply with 7 refills the dosing regime is 300mg loading dose on day 1 and 75mg/day thereafter.
15xConduct the 3 month visit which will start th e study for the patient.  Change drug 
therapy per the protocol  and randomization result.
Preoperative Procedures –
The investigator will determine and document on CRFs whether each patient meets 
the selection criteria previously outlined before enrollment into the study. He will also obtain informed consent for study pa rticipation from each patient prior to 
implantation of the study device.  A copy of the informed consent form will be kept by [CONTACT_608263]’s study notebook.  Patients not meeting the selection 
criteria or not receiving informed consent should not
be enrolled in the study. 
The investigator will determine and record on CRF1 each patient’s demographics and relevant medical history, i.e., age at implant, gender, [LOCATION_001] Heart Association 
(NYHA) functional class, cardiac rhythm, di sease etiology, previous cardiac surgery,
relevant information to determine throm boembolic risk group and valve lesion (i.e., 
stenosis, regurgitation or mix ed stenosis/regurgitation).
These instructions are made to assist the study coordinator in filling out the form. Complete all items on the form. If information is unavailable to answer any item, make a note on the form and attach an ex planation, as appropriate. When asked to 
specify a particular answer, use a short description.  Please check any and all items that apply to the patient.
For patient study number, use a [ADDRESS_806308] number represents the position of the
implant; [ADDRESS_806309] name [CONTACT_608317] (page 2 of  CRF1). Room is given for three prior 
procedures. Attach a separate explana tion if more prior surgery was done. For 
coronary artery by[CONTACT_4897], please note the number of grafts by [CONTACT_608264]:  CABG x 2 = double graft; CABG x 3 = triple graft; and so on.
If the patient has been maintained on any permanent or long-term preoperative 
Coumadin therapy, the preoperative INR shoul d be measured and recorded within 72
hours prior to surgery.
16Operative Procedures –
The surgical technique employed is that developed and perfected by [CONTACT_1961] [INVESTIGATOR_608214]. Operative details such as 
cardioplegia are not specified in the pr otocol, but must be documented on CRF2.
The investigator will record on CRF2 information regarding the particular valve(s) 
implanted and other details c oncerning the surgery such as suture technique and any 
concomitant procedures. Carefully record the valve position, size and serial number.
Use the patient study number assigned on the preoperative form (CRF1) to identify 
the patient. Check any and all of the items that apply to this patient. Where explanations are needed, print a brie f description of the required data.
For concomitant procedures, there are spaces for these additional procedures. Write in the name [CONTACT_608318]. For coronary artery by[CONTACT_15806], also note the number of grafts (i.e., CABG x 2 = double graf t, CABG x 3 = triple graft, and so on).
Where requested, attach a dditional CRFs or reports.
The Implant Registration Card is included with the valve packaging and is used for tracking valves within the study. It must be completed and returned to the sponsor 
within [ADDRESS_806310] is to be completed and given to the patient as a form of permanent medical identification.
Early Postoperative/Discharge Procedures –
The investigator will record the date of the patient’s discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_608215]-up examination on CRF3. The early follow-up exam records the patient’s status at the time of discharge or at [ADDRESS_806311].  The patient’s NYHA and cardiac rhythm status and any complications will be noted along with the patient’s amticoagulation therapy. It is important to record the international normalized ratio (INR) at the time of the exam. Wherever possible this value should be within the therapeutic range required by [CONTACT_608265] C.
At each postoperative assessment, the investig ator will need to determine the patient’s 
availability for future follow-up. If any patie nt needs to be seen at other than a 
regularly scheduled follow-up visit, the same follow-up information as required at regular times will be documented by [CONTACT_608266]-up form, and that follow-up will be indicated as an off schedule visit.
Late Follow-up Reporting –
Late follow-up is required in at [ADDRESS_806312] be in person; telephone or questionnaire fo llow-up is not allowed. If 
a patient misses a scheduled fo llow-up visit, the investigator must make an effort to 
contact [CONTACT_608267]. A new visit should be 
scheduled, but if the patient refuses to return for follow-up or otherwise cannot be 
17contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], the patient is then recorded as  lost or withdrawn from the study. The 
efforts to maintain contact [CONTACT_608268]-up form, and every 
effort will be made to minimize the number of patients lost (zero being preferable). Thus, a follow-up form (CRF3) is due annually on each patient whether or not follow-up has occurred.
At the 3 month follow-up each patient shall be randomized into treatment group.  The 
investigator will log into th e data management system to be assigned the random (test 
or control) group for the patient per the web-based procedure briefly described below.
If any patient has suffered a thrombotic or bleeding event during the initial 3 month 
period, he/she shall not be randomized in to a group and shall be considered a 
screening failure and the event shall not be  analyzed with any group under an intent-
to-treat classification.
The randomization module implements a standard randomization algorithm, 
Marsenne Twister that is implemented in Java.  (Matsumoto M. and Nishimura T., 
“Marsenne Twister: A 623-Dimensionally Equidistributed Uniform Pseudo-Random 
Number Generator”, ACM Transactions  on Modeling and Computer Simulation, 
1998;8:3-30.)  The patented randomization module can provide bl ock and stratified 
randomization results.
The procedure automatically executes upon eligibility documentation for a study 
subject.  The randomization result is pres ented on the screen instantaneously upon 
eligibility documentation using sponsor provide d language and is also stored in the 
study database.  The Tempo electronic ra ndomization process ensures only eligible 
subjects are randomized and no errors are ma de in storing the correct result of 
randomization.  The Tempo system audit trail documents the randomization results 
and time of execution.
Late follow-up information includes in all cases the patient initials or ID, cardiac 
rhythm, NYHA classification, and anticoagulant therapy information, including where applicable the most recent INR provided by [CONTACT_608269].  For any new complication, the complication report (CRF4)  must be complete d and attached. All 
complications that have occurred between  follow-up examinations must be reported
on the form. Echocardiography per section III D is required at 1, 3 and 5 years.
Complication Reporting –
All complications should be recorded by [CONTACT_608270]4. Start and stop dates and etiology should be  noted. The investigator w ill attempt to evaluate the 
relationship of all deaths, reoperations, expl ants, or cardiovascular complications to 
the study valve as presented in the AATS/STS guidelines 
(2)and will provide 
pertinent details of the event on CRF4. C opi[INVESTIGATOR_608216]/or death 
summary must be included where applicable. 
The investigator will report any serious or unexpected complication occurring during 
the investigation to the monitor within [ADDRESS_806313] lear ns of the event. A serious or unexpected 
complication would include those complications not expected, or those occurring at a greater rate than expected when compared to the review requirements of this study 
(see section III F).
18Adverse events are defined by [CONTACT_608271], meaning:
“Operative mortality, morbid events, and consequences of morbid events. 
Complications may or may not be device related.”
This study uses the term “complication” to mean any adverse event or adverse device 
effect (a device-related adverse event), whic h may be mild, moderate, or severe. If as 
a result of a complication during a clinical investigation a subject has to be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], if hospi[INVESTIGATOR_608217], if 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_608218] e of potential danger to life, if a 
reoperative intervention has been necessary, or if the event is terminal, the complication is regarded as severe.
The definitions which appear in the following sections will be used to report 
complications associated with the use of the On-X prosthesis. Complications will be recorded and dated when they are observed or estimated to have occurred and treatment(s) documented. An event will be recorded once unless there are multiple occurrences of that event. For example, a cerebrovascular accident (CVA) reported once with sequelae still present at subsequent follow-visits will not be reported again. If another CVA occurs that is unrelated to the initial epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], then it is reported as a separate incident.
When determining whether a complication is valve related this study will use the 
definitions of the AATS/STS guidelines 
(2).  More specific guidance on these 
determinations is contained in the followi ng discussions of the various types of 
complications. In any case, adequate documentation must be supplied to support the contention that a complication generally regarded as valve related is not valve related. Information that pertains to reoperati on and death must be recorded on the 
appropriate sections of CRF4. For death, th e cause of death must be established, and 
an autopsy performed when possible. A ttach supporting hospi[INVESTIGATOR_608219]. Following comple tion of the information, the investigator must review, 
date, and sign the CRF.
Specific Instructions for Completing CRF4 –
The complication form (CRF4) is designed to allow the identification of event type, then to note how each event was treated; what the outcome of the complication was; and what the patient’s status at the time of the event was. Death from unrelated causes is also reported on CRF4. 
Study valve related reoperation is defined as any operation that repairs, alters or 
replaces an implanted, study prosthesis, also included are operations that treat other 
valve related complications but do not involve  surgery on this valve, i.e., surgery to 
resolve a hemorrhagic complication. This category also includes incidental 
replacement of the prosthesis, e.g., the patient undergoes surgery for a different 
cardiovascular procedure and the surgeon decides to remove the study valve. 
Cardiovascular surgical procedures other than repair or replacement of the study 
valve will also be recorded on the CRF4.
Death will be recorded as cardiac or not, and valve related or not.  Valve related 
deaths include deaths from the following causes:
x thrombosis or thromboembolism;
19x endocarditis;
x prosthetic valve dysfunction;
x anticoagulant related hemorrhage;
x hemolysis; and
x congestive heart failure, where docume ntation of a cause other than the 
valve cannot be given; and sudden unexplained death without autopsy 
which can definitely assign other causes than the valve. 
Deaths caused by [CONTACT_608272] s with advanced myocardial disease and 
satisfactorily functioning pros thetic valves are not considered valve related. Any 
death that occurs within 30 days of reop eration for a valve related complication is 
considered valve related.
Classification of each complication is described in sections that follow.
Thromboembolism       
Thromboembolism is defined as any valv e thrombosis or embolus exclusive of 
infection. This includes any new focal or gl obal neurological deficit (transient or 
permanent), myocardial infarction, prosthe tic thrombosis, or peripheral arterial 
embolus.A transient neurological event is defined as  an abrupt onset of a focal neurological 
deficit lasting at least one minute but  resolving without permanent sequelae.
Acute myocardial infarction (MI) is in cluded as a thromboembolic complication 
when coronary anatomy was normal at the time of implant and there is no 
angiographic or other clinical evidence that the MI was due to coronary artery spasm or newly-developed coronary artery disease.
Thrombosis is any thrombus not caused by [CONTACT_608273], interferes with va lve function or is 
sufficiently large to warrant treatment. This is listed as a subcategory of thromboembolism and should be confirmed by [CONTACT_608274], reoperation (explant) 
or autopsy. Any patient with confirmed prosthetic valve th rombosis is to be treated 
with surgery, thrombolysis and/or hepari n based on the clinical assessment of the 
particular patient and on what is considered best and most  appropriate treatment for 
the patient.  Clinical judgment can be used to diagnose the presence of thrombosis (lack of normal prosthetic valve sound, pr olonged lowered blood pressure, loss of 
consciousness, cardiovascular shock) if the clinical diagnosis is accompanied by a confirming medical test (echocardiograph y, cineradiography or angiography).
Thrombi that are secondary to another primary complication; i.e., endocarditis, are recorded but also noted to be a secondary event by [CONTACT_608275].
Excluded from the thromboembolism category are:
xEvents which occur intraoperatively or within [ADDRESS_806314] on the 
complication form (CRF4).
For any thromboembolic event it is important to determine the INR of the patient at 
the time of the event, if possible.  Every attempt should be made to do so.
Bleeding Events
Hemorrhage is defined as any epi[INVESTIGATOR_608220]. This also includes any epi[INVESTIGATOR_608221]. Any antic oagulants used and INR at the time of 
hemorrhage should be determined, if possibl e. These events will be classified as 
major or minor, and are defined as follows.
xMajor:  An epi[INVESTIGATOR_608222], stroke, 
operation, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or requires transfusion or peri cardiocentesis. Examples 
include nosebleeds that require outpatient transfusion, cerebral bleeding that results in 
neurological damage and/or death, and gastrointestinal bleeding that requires 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].
xMinor:  All other epi[INVESTIGATOR_608223]. Examples include 
nosebleeds that do not require transfusion, he matomas due to trauma  or surgery that 
do not require transfusion, and ocular he morrhage. Bleeding from open traumatic 
wounds (cuts, abrasions, etc.) are exclude d, unless the bleeding goes uncontrolled 
enough to require intervention that woul d place the event in the major category.
Prosthetic Valve Endocarditis
Prosthetic valve endocarditis is defined as documented evidence of infection of the 
prosthesis based on histopathological evid ence in a surgical or autopsy specimen 
and/or customary clinical criteria, including an appropriate combination of positive 
blood cultures, clinical signs (fever, new/altered cardiac murmurs, splenomegaly, systemic emboli, and immunopathological le sions). The organism(s) involved should 
be identified whenever possible.
Prosthetic Valve Dysfunction
Prosthetic valve dysfunction is defined as any change in valve performance which results from intrinsic or extrinsic abnorma lities that cause stenosis or regurgitation. 
Prosthetic valve dysfunction can be classified as structural deteri oration, nonstructural 
dysfunction, or paravalvular leak.
a. Structural Valve DeteriorationStructural valve deterioration is any change in function of the prosthesis which results 
from an intrinsic abnormality that causes stenosis or regurgitation. The diagnosis 
should be based on an examination of the explanted or damaged valve. Examples include excessive wear, leaflet escape, leaf let fracture, housing crack, leaflet pi[INVESTIGATOR_22940], 
21or sewing ring deterioration. Excluded from this category is structural deterioration 
which results from endocarditis, paravalvular leak, and thrombosis.
b. Nonstructural Valve DysfunctionNonstructural dysfuncti on of the valve is any change in function of the prosthesis that 
results in stenosis or regurgitation which is not intrinsic to the valve. Examples 
include patient-prosthesis mismatch, leaflet entrapment by [CONTACT_608276],
paravalvular leak and hemolytic anemia . The diagnosis should be confirmed by 
[CONTACT_608277]. Events to be excluded are those 
associated with endocarditis, paravalvular leak, and thrombosis.
c. Paravalvular LeakAny evidence of leakage of blood around the prosthesis between the sewing ring and
native annulus. Diagnosis of parava lvular leak may be obtained from 
echocardiography; however, definitive diag nosis will be obtained at reoperation, 
explant, or autopsy. Indicate severity of the leak.
Indicate if the event is secondary to  another valve-rela ted complication, e.g., 
endocarditis, hemolysis, thromboembolism, thrombosis. Such events will be 
classified as major (required surgical interv ention) or minor (does not require surgical 
intervention).
Hemolytic Anemia
Hemolytic anemia will be recorded as a complication in all cases of anemia that are attributable to the valve, based on usual clinical criteria.  Indicate if hemolytic anemia is primary or secondary to another valve related adverse event (e.g., paravalvular 
leak). Events that are excluded are those due to liver disease, myocardial infarction, or systemic infection, where these causes ar e confirmed by [CONTACT_608278].
Hemolysis
On going hemolysis shall be defined by [CONTACT_608279] 125% of 
laboratory upper normal and serum lactate dehy drogenase (SLDH) values at greater 
than twice (200%) the laboratory upper nor mal unless the cellular source of the 
SLDH can be determined to be other than the red blood cell as evidenced by [CONTACT_608280]3, LD4 or LD5, and/or clinical evidence of recent myocardial infarction.  Plasma free he moglobin, serum haptoglobin, reticulocyte 
count and SLDH shall be tested whenever he molysis is suspected in any patient and 
SLDH isoenzymes shall be fractionated wh enever the SLDH test value is above 
175% of upper normal.
Unanticipated Valve-Related Event
It is unknown what kind of event would qualify for the use of this form, but it is supplied in case any unknown valve-related complication should arise that does not 
meet any other defined criteri on.  Should this happen this event must be reported to 
the monitor immediately, since it is likely to create immediate regulatory reporting requirements.  An occurrence of an unknown ne gative effect is very serious and must 
not be left unreported for any length of time.
Congestive Heart Failure
Congestive heart failure will be considered valve related if the event is new and is not continued from a preoperative heart failure  condition, and is caused by [CONTACT_444035] 
22following prosthesis-related events:  Anticoagulant-related hemorrhage, endocarditis, 
hemolysis, nonstructural dysf unction, paravalvular leak, structural deterioration, 
thromboembolism, thrombosis, or reoperation.
The most common causes of non-valve relate d congestive heart failure are coronary 
artery disease, hypertension, valvular hear t disease (due to a valve other than the 
study valve), cardiomyopathy, cor pulmonale, congenital heart disease, or unknown 
causes.  When an event is considered not valve related the reasons for that decision
must be recorded.
Other Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Complications
Other cardiovascular and pulmonary compli cations are defined as a complication or 
any new diagnosis that is not related to the prosthesis, but is important to subsequent 
morbidity and mortality of the patient, e.g ., cardiomyopathy, aortic aneurysm, chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary embolism. These events may be characterized by [CONTACT_15006]:  necessity for intervention, new or unduly prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or death.  Minor events of no importance to the patient’s 
valve related morbidity or mortality, su ch as acute upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_18073], 
should not be reported.
D. Echocardiography Procedures
Echocardiographic evaluation of the study prosthesis is required by [CONTACT_608281], and at the first, third and fifth annual follow-ups. For MVR patients enrolled
late postoperatively the 1-year echo will occur at the visit closest to 1-year after surgery and 3-year and 5-year echoes at [ADDRESS_806315] been obtained and that all data 
are reviewed for accuracy before the patient has left the facility. 
The echocardiography protocol used will generally follow that developed by [CONTACT_608282]
(1), but specifically shall follow the steps given in Appendix F.  Echo 
reports along with an electronic copy of the echo shall be sent to the monitor for 
eventual review by [CONTACT_608283]. Only directly measured data will be provided by [CONTACT_16018], and all calculated data w ill be derived at the core center.  The 
core cardiologist will reassess thrombus and regurgitation as well.
Transthoracic echocardiographic examinations will follow a step-by-step progression 
of the following interrogation regions:  left parasternal, api[INVESTIGATOR_608224], right parasternal, subcostal, and suprasternal. The progression of interrogation regions is 
transgastric, esophagogastric, and mid-esopha geal. For each interrogation include 2D 
and M-mode recording for structure, func tion and timing data, and color Doppler for 
flow pattern to guide the pulsed (PW) and continuous (CW) Doppler measurements.  All data reported on CRF [ADDRESS_806316], this measure 
should not be made and the space shoul d be noted as unavailable on the CRF.
E.  Reoperation and/ or Explant Procedures
Whenever a valve reoperation occurs whether or not as a result of one of the complications described in Section C above complete and return CRF 5.
Explants are requested at autopsy whenever practical.  Reoperative explants may also occur.  Return of explanted valves within the study is required.
Specific explant analysis requirements ar e included in this plan. Explanted
mechanical valve prosthesis refers to a study valve that has been removed from the 
patient at reoperation or autopsy. The recommended procedures have been developed 
to ensure accuracy, consistency and complete ness of the analysis of explanted valves. 
This section outlines in detail the procedures for explanting, recording data and returning the explanted valves.
Explanting the Valve
When explanting a valve at reoperation or autopsy:1) Inspect the mechanical valve prosthesis prior to removal including the 
condition of the annulus for evidence of dysfunction such as thrombi, 
paravalvular leak, vegetations, pannus ove rgrowth. Culture of pertinent areas 
of the valve when appropriate is mandatory.
2) Examine the lining of the chambers of the heart, both proximal and distal to 
the valve for possible jet lesi ons or endocardial fibrosis.
3) Special attention should be paid to the possibility of extrinsic interference 
with the valve function, par ticularly by [CONTACT_608284].
4) If possible, photograph the m echanical valve prosthesis in situ . For valves 
obtained at autopsy, photograph both the inflow and outflow aspects.
5) DO NOT rinse the valve.
6) Request an explant kit from the sponsor and place the valve in the jar provided 
in the explant kit.
7) If no explant kit is available, place the valve in either 1% glutaraldehyde 
solution or 10% buffered formalin until a kit is obtained. 
8) Record observations on CRF5 in  the appropriate locations.
Data and Shippi[INVESTIGATOR_608225]:
241) Attach a copy of the reoperative or autopsy report to  the appropriate 
CRF5.
2)Attach any in situ photographs to CRF5.
3) Ship the valve as instructed in the explant kit, clearly marked as an 
explant, and inform the monitor by [CONTACT_608285].
4) Notify your clinical research mon itor if the valve cannot be returned.
5) If the valve is examined by a pathologist at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_608226], send that report to the monitor as well.
Each returned heart valve received by [CONTACT_456] (or monitor) will be tracked 
and analysis information compi[INVESTIGATOR_608227]. Each explant will be analyzed by [CONTACT_608286]/her report will be provided to the investigator and monitor.  
F. Adverse Events
If a test group patient suffers a thrombotic event during the trial, he/she will be 
removed from the cohort and returned to st andard Coumadin therapy. If a test group 
patient suffers a bleeding event during the trial, he/she may continue with the LDtherapy regime or may be removed fro m the study depending upon the principal 
investigator’s clinical judgment. In any case such patients shall be followed and 
remain in the test group for analysis purposes based on an intent-to-treat classification.

H. Data Analysis
Data will be analyzed using Kaplan-Meier life tables and linearized rates.  Although 
randomization does not occur until month 3, early postoperative data ( PRQWKV
postoperative) will be analyzed to examine potential differences between test and control groups using regular percentage comp arisons.  Data will be  stratified by [CONTACT_608287].  Data forms will be completed preoperatively, operatively and at each follow-up.  This can be done on paper or 
electronically at the mutual choice of the center and the study monitor.

purpose.  Extra forms will be provided on request, or as needed.
I. Reports
Summary reports of the study shall be pr oduced annually by [CONTACT_608288],
and be provided to each investigator, Data Safety Monitoring Committee member and ethics committee chairperson.
IV. Device Description and Risk Analysis
The On-X prosthesis is a bileaflet mechanical heart valve prosthesis.  The housing consists of On-X pyrolytic carbon coating on a graphite substrate.
Two radiopaque leaflets are constrained by [CONTACT_21173] [INVESTIGATOR_608230].  The leaflets are 
On-X pyrolytic carbon deposited on a graphite substrate which is mixed with 10 weight 
% tungsten to allow for radiographic visualization.  In the closed position, the occluders 
rest at 40qwithin the valve orifice.  The valve design permits maximum leaflet opening 
angles of [ADDRESS_806318] flow.
The rotatable sewing ring is made from polytet rafluoroethylene (PTFE) fabric attached to 
the valve housing by [CONTACT_608289] 5-0 suture material.  The 
26retaining rings positively attach the sewing ring to the valve housing by [CONTACT_608290] a
flange on the housing OD.  They also provide the means for radiographic visualization and identification.  There are no coatings or treatments on the fabric, although black 
orientation marks are included on the ring fabr ic.  The sewing rings are supra-annular and 
allow the tissue annulus to abut the pyroly tic carbon housing directly, except in sizes 
larger than 25 mm, where the sewing ring s become intra-annular to allow the 25 mm 
housing (largest size made) to fit properly into larger tissue annuli.
Valves are packaged on a valve holder with a separately packaged, removable handle to facilitate insertion and in situ orientation, and to pr ovide protection dur ing shipment and 
handling.  The package is designed for sh ipment protection as well as handling ease. 
Valves are surgically clean and have been sterilized.  The instructions for use packaged with the valve describe the handling of the valve during surgery in detail.  Adhere to all instructions, warnings and precautions in the labeling.  
A review of the literature on Coumadin anticoagulation of mechanical heart valve 
prostheses is inconclusive on the preferable  therapy for various valves.  Various groups 
have struggled with the lack of informati on on the subject of anticoagulation; yet have 
crafted recommendations based on informati on available.  These include the ACCP 
(3)
and AHA/ACC (4)recommendations.  Butchart(5)in a review of embolism in prosthetic 
heart valves concluded that valves vary in susceptibility to thrombosis due to subtle design differences, that optimal INR range is often uncertain, and that further research is needed.
Many studies of various mechanical valves have attempted to examine low intensity 
Coumadin therapy, Coumadin pl us aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], aspi[INVESTIGATOR_608231].  
These studies have had mixed results.  Horstkotte 
(6)suggested that INR levels of 3.[ADDRESS_806319]. Jude valve, but that  a prospective trial is needed to show the 
proper level.  Cannegieter (7)in the first detailed study of optimum anticoagulation 
suggested the target of 3.[ADDRESS_806320] studied and suggested lower INR targets (8-12)in the range of 2.[ADDRESS_806321] examined lower C oumadin in combination with antiplatelet 
agents, such as aspi[INVESTIGATOR_608232].  Starting with the work of Turpie, et al (13)
various groups have shown a be nefit of adding aspi[INVESTIGATOR_608232], to Coumadin(14-
15).  But some mixed results indicating a possible increase in bleeding occurred with 
addition of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] (16-17).  Three separate meta-analyses (18-20)support the addition of low-
dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_608233].Another strategy for reducing thrombotic a nd bleeding events from Coumadin therapy is 
to control the therapy better with clinic or home monitoring.  These studies have 
uniformly shown better results with better control 
(21-23).  Yet still bleeding and 
thrombosis rates are considered suboptimal for mechanical valves, even though a 
background rate for these events exists that becomes about 2% per year at 80 years old 
(24).
As mechanical valves have long been known for their durability, they have also been 
thought to require long-term Coumadin anticoa gulation to prevent thrombotic events.  
This requirement subjects patients to an incr eased risk of bleeding events and has been 
27the major shortcoming in the performance of mechanical valves.  It is, therefore, 
desirable to reduce or eli minate Coumadin anticoagulation.
The valve selected for this trial must also  be shown to perform better than existing 
mechanical valves in terms of adverse events  and other surrogate endpoints that indicate 
possible reduction of events based on the ef fects of valve design.  These endpoints 
include adverse event rates, (especially in relation to the degree of anticoagulation actually achieved in a study),  hemodynamics and hemolysis.
The On-X aortic valve has been shown to achieve low adverse event rates 
[25,26],
especially in the face of sporadic anticoagulation[27].  This is true also when compared to 
a similar contemporary study [28].  The hemodynamics of the valve are superior to other 
mechanical valves [26,29]indicating a reduction in turbulence which can effect blood 
damage and thrombotic events.  The valve also produces very little hemolysis in the aortic or mitral position 
[30], which also indicates a poten tial for reduced thrombotic 
complications.  
A study of the valve in sheep in a model designed to predict resistance to thrombosis, 
performed by [CONTACT_608291] (31), found that the On-X valve sta tistically outperformed both the 
SJM and CMI valves. The first thrombosis of an On-X valve occurred at [ADDRESS_806322] 
without thrombosis compared to 0 of 7 for the others.  
In an ongoing clinical trial in South Africa (32), [ADDRESS_806323] been implanted 
with 100% follow-up out to about 3 years.   About 40% of these patients are not 
anticoagulated due to the social conditions in South Africa, yet there has been only one
thrombosis event in the mitral position in the study.  Given the valve’s clinical performance to date, it is an ideal candida te for a study using lower dose Coumadin.
V. Monitoring Procedures
The monitor of the study shall be a professi onal staff member of the Clinical Studies 
Department of the sponsor.  M onitoring of the clinical tria l will be a continuous process 
to ensure that high quality data are obtained through compliance with the investigational 
plan. Case report forms or electronic data will be reviewed for accuracy, completeness, 
and conformity with requirements. Particular attention will be paid to complication reporting. Frequent communication will be maintained with each clinical center to keep both the center and the sponsor informed a nd aware of the clinical trial progress.
On-site monitoring of all study centers will occur at least annually to ensure continued 
acceptability of the center by [CONTACT_608292]., adherence 
to data collection procedures, verification of the accuracy of submitted clinical data to the patient’s source documents, maintenance of clinical trial records, verification of informed consent, and verification of control of test articles. Reports of each center’s audits will be provided to the investigator and sponsor, a nd if necessary, appropriate corrective action 
will be taken to ensure compliance to the investigation plan.
Preinvestigation Visit:
28Preinvestigation visits will be  conducted by [CONTACT_608293]:

Annual Center Visit and Audit:
Following the preinvestigation visit, on-site monitoring visits will be conducted at least annually.
On-site monitoring visits will assess the progress of the clinical trial and identify any 
concerns that result from device performance a nd review of the investigator’s clinical 
trial records, study management documents and patient consent forms. This review 
includes adherence to the investigational plan, Ethics Committee or IRB review of the clinical trial and its progress and maintenance of records and reports.
To assure the integrity of the clinical trial data, individual patient records and other source documents are compared to reports from the investigator to determine that:
xThe information recorded in the case report forms and/or reports is accurate, complete 
and legible.
xThere are no omissions in the case report form s  of specific data (e.g., development of 
an intercurrent illness)
xMissing follow-up visits are documented in the reports.
xPatients failing to complete the clinical trial and the reason for failure are noted in the reports.
xInformed consent has been documented.
29A record of the monitor’s findings will be maintained by [CONTACT_608295]:
xThe date(s) of the visit.
xThe name(s) of the monitor(s) who conducted the visit.
xThe name(s) and address of the investig ator(s) and other center staff who were 
visited.
xA statement of the findings, conclusions and any actions taken to correct deficiencies

Resolution of concerns and completion of assigned tasks will be documented by [CONTACT_36102].
Interim Visits:
Interim visits to the study centers will be c onducted as deemed to be necessary, typi[INVESTIGATOR_608234].
Final Center Visit:
A final visit to the study center may be made by [CONTACT_2037], if necessary. Any ongoing responsibilities that will continue after the final visit will be discussed with the 
investigator and the study cent er coordinator. A final mon itoring report, which includes 
device inventory verification and disposition of unused devices, will be prepared by [CONTACT_2037].
Regular Reports:
The monitor will provide regular at least quarterly summary reports of the clinical investigation to all investigat ors and the sponsor. The conten ts of these reports will be 
determined by [CONTACT_608296].
The sponsor or monitor will provide reports to each investigator based on individual 
requests for data. Each investigator will also get at least a quarterly update of the required 
activities for the study at his/her center.
VI. Legal/Ethical Considerations
The study will be conducted under the rules of the local country or the Declaration of 
Helsinki whichever provides mo re patient protection.  Wher e governmental approval is 
required (FDA, competent authority or Health Canada), it will be obtained prior to 
starting the study at any center in such country.  All centers will have the approval of 
their local ethics committee before beginning patient enrollment.  All patients will begiven adequate written informed consent.  Th e patient must agree to, and understand, the 
drug therapy regime and the follow-up requireme nts.  Informed consent shall include all 
elements of information required by [CONTACT_608297], and sh all notify the patient 
that data will be shared with government regu latory bodies as needed. See the example in 
Appendix C.
Sponsors must be able to verify to regulatory agencies, e.g., the Food and Drug 
Administration, that this clinical investiga tion has been conducted in accordance with 
30ethical principles. The Investigational Devi ce Exemption (IDE) regulation applies to the 
[LOCATION_002].  At each center investigators are required to:
xObtain informed consent from patient s involved in the clinical trial
xObtain Institutional Review Board approval prior to starting the clinical trial at their 
institution.

45APPENDIX C
Clinical Trial of the On-X®Valve Using Low Dose Anticoagulation
Example Patient Informed Consent Form
Statement of Research
You are being invited to participate in a clini cal trial (research study) as described below.
Please read the following explanation and ask your  physician any and all questions that you have 
before agreeing to participate in this study wh ich will involve the On-X Prosthetic Heart Valve.
Information about the Research
The On-X heart valve consists of an On-X py rolytic carbon housing and leaflets with a titanium 
alloy ring around the housing. There is a sewing ring made of knitted polytetrafluoroethylene 
attached to the housing with two titanium rings a nd suture material. I understand these materials 
have a long history of use in cardiac prostheses.
The On-X heart valve, (the Prosthesis), is in tended for treatment of patients who have been 
diagnosed with disease of a heart valve, and require replacement of their natural aortic or mitral 
valve, or previously implanted mechanical or tissue aortic or mitral valve.
The purpose of this study is to define the lowest  level of required antithrombotic (anti-blood clot) 
therapy for the Prosthesis.  It is a randomized trial of three different antithrombotic drug 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  The therapi[INVESTIGATOR_608246]: 1.) low risk of clotting having an aortic valve replacement, 2.) higher  risk of clotting having an aortic valve 
replacement, and 3.) a mitral valve replacement.  Your doctor can tell you to which group you belong.  To belong to a group you may be requi red to have certain blood and urine tests done.  
These require the collection of about [ADDRESS_806325] a control group that uses th e presently recommended antithrombotic drug 
therapy of the American Heart Association using Coumadin
®and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248].  You will be randomly 
assigned to the treatment or the control group th at goes with your group.  The treatment drug 
therapy for the low risk aortic valve replacemen t group is a combination of two presently used 
drugs – aspi[INVESTIGATOR_278462]®.  The treatment drug therapy for the high risk aortic valve 
replacement group and the mitral valve replacemen t is a reduced dose of Coumadin and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248].
The Prosthesis is a device with about [ADDRESS_806326] surgery with implantation of  the Prosthesis. Your progress will be closely 
monitored and recorded at the following times: discharge (or within 30 days following surgery), three and six months after surgery, and [ADDRESS_806327] people or if you are found to not respond to the drug therapy.  You will be informed of this 
before your 3 month visit should it occur. Th e diagnostic tests will in clude echocardiograms 
(sound wave studies of the heart) at 1, [ADDRESS_806328] adherence 
to the timing and amounts of medicines prescribed  by [CONTACT_608304].  They can also be minimized when taking Coumadin by 
[CONTACT_450529] a diet low in vitamin K containing fo ods such as leafy green vegetables (spi[INVESTIGATOR_608247]), liver and cranberry juice.  Additiona lly no prescription or ove r-the-counter medications 
should be taken without prio r approval of your doctor.
47Foreseeable risks and discomforts will be minimi zed by [CONTACT_608305], but unforeseeable risks may 
occur.
Benefits
It is generally believed that lowering the dose of anticoagulation will reduce the chance of 
suffering a bleeding event, but will increase the chance of suffering a blood clotting event.  If a valve is less likely to have a clotting even t, then reducing anticoagulation should not 
significantly increase the risk of blood clotting even ts.  If assigned to the group using aspi[INVESTIGATOR_608248], a further benefit will be not requiring monthly bleeding tests.  Thus, the primary benefit of the study is restored function of the heart valve and restored general health  with less chance of 
problems.  Another benefit will be that your progress and health status will be carefully monitored.  Those patients on Coumadin will be monitored by [CONTACT_608306].  Any complication that mightarise may be detected and treated (if necessary) at an early stage, decreasing the potential for more serious problems.  Also, knowledge that is ga ined by [CONTACT_608307].
Alternative Methods of Treatment
Alternatives to heart valve replacement with the Prosthesis include replacement of your mitral or 
aortic valve with a different commercially available mechanical or tissue heart valve; or repair your native heart valve. Another alternative is that you may decide not to undergo any surgical 
treatment, and remain care d for with medications.
Confidentiality
Confidentiality of your medical records will be maintained at all times by [CONTACT_608308]. Regulatory authorities (those responsible for the well-being of patients involved in research studies) and the sponsor On -X Life Technologies, Inc., and monitor of the 
study may inspect and perhaps copy the medical research records, if necessary, to ensure the validity of the information. Knowledge that is gained from the study may be published in
scientific journals; however, no patient will be identified.
Research Related Injuries
If physical injury occurs due to involvement in the research, medical treat ment will be available, 
but you (or your insurance company) should be re sponsible for payment for the cost of treatment. 
Compensation for lost wages and/or direct or indirect losses will not be available. Further 
information about research-related injuries is available from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (telephone: ________-
_________-__________).
Your participation in this stud y does not waive any legal rights or release the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_608249].
Questions about the Research
Nothing in this document is intended to limit the authority of the doctor to provide emergency 
medical care to the extent that the doctor is  permitted to do so under applicable local laws.

of medical care. Your surgeon may also withdraw  you from the study for just cause without 
your prior consent, but will inform you if this action is taken.
Progress of the Study
As the study progresses and information is collected, your doctor will inform you of any new and 
significant findings related to the Prosthesis or the procedures associated with its use.
Costs
There will be no additional cost to you beyond th e usual customary costs associated with heart 
valve replacement. However, neither On-X Life Technologies nor (Name [CONTACT_423289][INVESTIGATOR_608251]) is responsible for compensation in the event of any physical injury that might occur 
as a result of your participation in this study. Information (tests, physical examinations, x-rays,

from calcium, the leading edge to leading edge conventi on will be used; if this ar tifact is excessive, the 
measurement will not be made.  The best measurement (usually at the preoperative examination) will be assumed to remain constant throughout the study.
4.3 From the subaortic waveform (for prostheses in mitral or aortic positions):  peak velocity (v
1), mean 
pressure drop (p 1), velocity integral (VTI 1).
4.4 From the transaortic waveform (prostheses in the aortic position only):  p eak velocity (v 2), mean pressure 
drop (p 2), velocity integral (VTI 2).
4.5 From the mitral waveform (prostheses in the mitral position only):  Pressure half-time (PHT), mean 
pressure drop, peak instantaneous early velocity (v m), diastolic velocity integral (DVI) .
544.6 Doppler measurements will be made over 3 cycles in sinus rhythm or over 5 to 10 cycles in atrial 
fibrillation (depending on clinical judgment).  These will then be averaged.
5. Calculations
The data collected will be entered on a database and the following calculations will be performed at the 
central laboratory:
5.1 Effective area by [CONTACT_608312] (EOA) in the aortic position:
EOA = CSA x VTI 1/ VTI 2 [1]
where CSA is left ventricular outflow cross-sectional area in cm2calculated from the diameter assuming 
circular cross-section; VTI 1is subaortic velocity integral in cm and VTI 2is aortic velocity integral in cm.
5.2 Effective area by [CONTACT_608313] (MOA) in the mitral position:
MOA =  CSA x VTI 1/ DVI [2]
where DVI is diastolic velocity integral in cm
5.3 Effective area by [CONTACT_608314]-time method (MOA1/2) in the mitral position:
MOA1/2 = 220/PHT [3]
5.4 Peak pressure drop across the aortic valve:
Peak ¨3 Y 22–v 12)[ 4]
5.5 Mean pressured difference across the aortic valve:
Mean ¨3 S 1–p 2 [5]
5.6 Peak pressure drop across the mitral valve:
3HDNǻ3 Y m2[6]
5.7 Cardiac Output:
CO = CSA x VTI 1x BPM  [7]
5.8 Indexed effective orifice areas (EOAI), and cardiac index (CI):
EOAI = EOA/BSA  [8]; CI = CO/BSA  [9]
5.9 Performance Index (PI):
PI = EOA/GOA  [10]
6. Other analyses
6.[ADDRESS_806334] deviation values will be calculated for the following 
parameters: peak transaortic velocity, mean transaortic velocity, mean pressure difference, peak pressure 
difference, effective orifice area, cardiac output and all indices.
6.[ADDRESS_806335] deviation values will be calculated for the following 
parameters:  peak transmitral velocity, peak transmitr al pressure difference, mean transmitral pressure 
difference, effective orifice area by [CONTACT_608315], pressure half-time and effective orifice area by 
[CONTACT_608316]-time, cardiac output and all indices.
6.3 The site and severity of aortic regurg itation and mitral regurgitation will be assessed.
6.4 The presence, site and size of any thrombus will be assessed.

1  PROTOCOL SUMMARY  
1.1 SYNOPSIS   
Title:  The interaction between diabetes and estradiol on human brain 
metabolism in postmenopausal women  
Study Des cription : Epi[INVESTIGATOR_619174] 
[ADDRESS_823056] is now kno wn. However, animal research 
suggests that it may occur through estrogen’s effects on cellular 
metabolism of glucose and ketone bodies. The primary aim of this study is 
to test whether type 2 diabetes interacts with estradiol on brain 
metabolism in vivo  in humans. This will be accomplished by [CONTACT_619191] -
term administration of transdermal 17 β-estradiol  in 10 postmenopausal 
women with diabetes and 10 non -diabetic postmenopausal women.  
Objectives:  
 Primary Objective: The primary objective is to determine whether the 
effects of glucose and ketone body uptake to the brain in response to 8 -
week administration of transdermal 17β-estradiol differ in 
postmenopausal women with and without type 2 diabetes.  
 Secondary Objectives:   Secondary objective : 1) Determine whether 8 -week 
administration of transdermal 17 β-estradiol  alters cognitive performance 
in postmenopausal women with and without type 2 diabetes.  
Endpoint s: Primary Endpoint : Glucose and ketone body uptake in brain measures with 
positron emission tomography. Regions of interest include the posterior 
cingulate, temporal cortex, and prefrontal cortex.  
Secondary Endpoints : Cognitive function assessed using composite scores 
of short -term memory and executive functioning. The short -term memory 
composite will be generated by [CONTACT_10618] z -scores from Story Recall, List 
Learning, and computerized  tasks. The executive function compos ite will 
be generated by [CONTACT_10618] z -scores of Trails part B -A, computerized tasks , 
and semantic access (letter and category word fluency).  
Study Population:  Postmenopausal women aged 60-80 years old will be recruited, 10 with 
type 2 diabetes and 10 without from the region of Forsyth County, North 
Carolina.  
Phase:  N/A

Sites /Facilities  Enrolling 
Participants : This is a single -site study that will take place at Wake Forest School of 
Medicine (WFSM).  
Description of Study  
Intervention : Participants receive 0.075 mg/day of transdermal 17 β-estradiol delivered 
via a Climara patch for 8 weeks. Estrogen levels will be measured on  9-11 
days  after  estrogen administration  begins  to titrate levels as needed to 
attain a circulating level of 50 -100pg/ml for each woman. Patches will be 
changed weekly. The study coordinator will contact [CONTACT_619192]. If women have a uterus, progestin 
will be prescribed at the end of the study to reverse potential endometr ial 
stimulation. All hormone administration will be supervised by [CONTACT_619193] , DO, Assistant Professor of Internal Medicine, Medical Director 
Acute Care for the Elderly Unit, Gerontology and Geriatric Medicine . 
Study Duration:  It is estimated that the study will last 24 -36 months from enrollment to 
completion of primary data analyses.  
Participa nt Duration:  Participants are expected to take 14 -18 weeks (3 -4 months) to complete 
all participant visits.

(AD) is the most commonly diagnosed form of deme ntia, 
estimated to affect 1 in 9 adults over the age of 65 and 1 
in 3 over 85. According to the Alzheimer’s Association, 
AD is the 6th leading cause of death in the United 
States,[ADDRESS_823060] the US $[ADDRESS_823061] women differently than 
men. A population -based study aimed at investigating risk profiles for AD found that risk profiles were 
different in men and women.15 Accumulation of misfolded proteins confers greater risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_619175]; for each unit of AD pathology observed on autopsy,  men’s 
risk of clinical dementia increased 3 -fold, but women’s risk increased [ADDRESS_823062] women . Type 2

concentrations had 14 times the risk for dementia relative to diabetic women with lower estrogen 
concentrations.18 Two recent papers from our group support this finding. Women with type 2 diabetes 
randomized to receive conjugated equine estrogen therapy in the Women’s Health Initiative Memory 
Study (WHIMS) had an increased risk for dementia and lower b rain volumes.19, 20

One mechanistic explanation for the population -level observation of an interaction between T2D status 
and estrogen is the healthy cell bias (HCB) theory of estrogen action.[ADDRESS_823064] ly metabolize fat, it can use ketone bodies as a fuel 
source.21, 22 The HCB theory posits that in healthy brain cells using glucose as their main substra te, 
estrogen’s glucose -enhancing properties augment the bioenergetic capability of cells; estrogen’s action 
is protective in this situation. However, in cells challenged by [CONTACT_174120], aging, or disease, the brain’s 
bioenergetic system may begin to rely on alt ernate fuel sources such as ketone bodies to meet its heavy Commonly Used Abbreviatio ns

time, estrogen’s suppression of ketone use may deprive cells of an alternate energy substrate. Such a 
scenario co uld pose a risk to brain health, as cells might not be able to fully meet their energy needs.  
Three compounds are generally referred to by [CONTACT_123473] ‘ketone body’: acetone, acetoacetate (AcAc) and 
3-betahydroxybutyrate (BHB). Acetone is considered to have limited significance in metabolism.22 The 
rate of ketone metabolism in the brain is regulated primarily by [CONTACT_619195], and secondly by 
[CONTACT_619196].22 Ketone bodies enter the brain via diffusion and monocarboxylic acid 
transporters (MCT1 and MCT2).22 Elevating circulating ketones, either through infusio n or during 
diabetic ketoacidosis, results in parallel increases in brain metabolism of AcAc and BHB.23-25 Persistently 
high levels of ketones, which can occur through prolonged fasting (3.5 days) or a ketogenic diet, increase 
permeability of the blood -brain barrier to ketones, suggesting an upregulation of transporters.22, [ADDRESS_823066] the HCB theory of estrogen action in humans by  [CONTACT_619197] a novel dual -tracer PET method before and after 
administration of estradiol in women with and without diabetes.  
Hypothesis  
Estrogen affects brain metabolism of ketone bodies and glucose differently in women with T2D and 
those without, in accordance with the healthy cell bias theory of estrogen action.  
Strengths and Weaknesses of Supporting Data  
1) Previous results showing int eraction between T2D and estrogen or gender on brain and cognitive 
outcomes are all large trials or epi[INVESTIGATOR_9037];2, 18-[ADDRESS_823067] with rigor and detail.  
2) The dual -tracer PET has been successfully used to assess difference in ket one body and glucose 
uptake in healthy younger and older adults31, 32 and older adults with cognitive impairme nt.33 Our 
preliminary data from an ongoing study (Fig. 2, section 3.4) show the method is sensitive to increased 
ketone uptake in response to a dietary intervention. Elevated ketone body levels have been observed in 
people with T2D,21, 22, 27, 29 but the number of studies is currently small. There is not good representation 
of women and no research that we know of assessing circu lating levels of ketone bodies in people of 
non-European descent with T2D.

RISKS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
• Administration of estrogen . Estrogen administration has known risks in postmenopausal 
women. Side effects associated with short –term  estrogen replacement therapy may include 
nausea, breast tenderness, spotting , or bleeding t hat is sometimes similar t o menstrual bleeding 
FEMME  
Protocol – V8.0  03/1 6/2021   6 (monthly period) .  Side effects associated with long -term  (several years) estrogen use include 
the potential for developi[INVESTIGATOR_619176] (blood clot) in the leg, over -growth of the uterine lining 
that may lead to a type of uterine cancer, and a possible increased risk for breast cancer.  
 
Administration of estrogen  in this study will be short term  (8 weeks). This dose of estrogen, 
commonly used in clinical practice, is below that used in previous studies without any medical 
complications,34-36 and with a very low incidence of adverse effects (i.e., mil d skin irritation at 
the patch site, slight breast tenderness). If women have a uterus, progestin will be prescribed at 
the end of the study to reverse potential endometrial stimulation.  In addition, estrogen levels 
will be monitored during the second week  of estrogen administration to ensure they are 
between 50 -100pg/ml for each woman. The reference range for c irculating levels of estrogen in 
ovulating premenopausal women used by [CONTACT_619198]  85-498 pg/ml . The sele cted level for this 
study, 50 -100pg/ml, is commonly used in clinical practice because it is within a physiologically 
active range, but has a low incidence of adverse events.  All hormone administration will be 
supervised by [CONTACT_619199], DO  (Assistant Professor of Internal Medicine, Medical Director 
Acute Care for the Elderly Unit, Gerontology and Geriatric Medicine ).37, [ADDRESS_823068], 
the age ran ge selected for the study (6 0-80 years) is based on the few studies that have 
observed this effect in women. The 3 Cities Study reported on women in this age range ,18 and 
this was also the approximate age range in the Women’s Health  Initiative Memory Study 
(WHIMS).39, [ADDRESS_823069] them cease taking hormones for a period of time. However,

physicians to stop their medication for the duration of the study,  and finding half with type [ADDRESS_823070] these hypotheses was to bring in a small number of postmenopausal women in

• PET scan.  Exposure  to radiation from PET and paired low-dose CT scans. The amount of whole 
body  radiation dose/pa rticipant/year of the Radiation Dr ug Research  Committee (RDRC ) is 30 
mSv (3 rem).  Each woman will be sca nned twice and be e xposed to a total of 2.62 rem, which is 
below RDRC limit. 
1. [F-18]FDG PET:  2 x  1.10 rem    = 2.2 rem 
2. [C-11]AcAc PET: 2 x 0.0374 rem = 0.[ADDRESS_823071]:    4 x 0.084 rem  = 0.[ADDRESS_823072] year, and be instructed  
to increase  their fluid intake and to void frequently following each P ET scanning sess ion to 
minimize bladder exposure.  This radiation dose is n ot expected  to produce a ny harmful effects, 
although there is no  known minimum  level of radiation exposure  considered to be  totally free of 
the risk of causing genetic defects or cancer. The risk assoc iated with the amount of radiation 
exposure  participants receive in th is study is considered low and co mparable to every day risks. 
Because the targeted population is pos tmenopausal women,  no P ET stu dies will be p erformed  
on pregnant or potentially pregn ant women or children. 
 
[C-11] Aceto acetate administrati on has  not demonstrated a ny toxic effects in pat ients, as 
reported by [CONTACT_619200]é  de Sherbrooke (143 patients) (Tremblay 
et al. 2007, Applied Radiation and Isotopes, 65(8): 934-940; Nugent et al. 2014, Neurobiology of 
Aging, 35(6): 1386-1395). The ra diopharmac eutical preparation has  no pharmacological effects. 
Sodium Acetoacet ate C-11 Injection is administered  intravenously in 3-6 mL of citrate buffer 
solution for Injection, USP. The pH  of the solution is 3.5 -6.5. There is no evidence that 
administration of [C-11] Acetoacetate increases  the risk of ketoacidosis. Based on  the maximum  
amount  of Methyllithium reagent used for the synthesis and a 21% reaction yield, the  maximum  
amount of acetoacetic  acid synthes ized is 2-5 mg. This amount is not significant considering 
that the amou nt of acetic acid no rmally present  in the p lasma is  ~25 mg/L. However, a rare 
reaction to  any of the drugs or procedures to which the p articipant will be e xposed is possible. 
Thus, a physician will be a vailable at all times during scanning, and an  emergency cart will be in 
close pr oximity. If adverse  effects occ ur, medical inter vention will be pro vided promptly.  
• MRI scan.  The MRI machine does not use radiation (such as x -rays) and is considered safe. No 
serious biological effects have been reported from MRI scans. However, operation of the MRI 
machine produces loud noise. Participants are required to wear earplugs provided at the MRI 
center. All MRI scans are administered by a trained MRI technician on a research -dedicated 
FEMME  
Protocol – V8.0  03/1 6/[ADDRESS_823073]. At the participant’s request, we will share the research MRI scans with their 
physician.  
 
• Blood sampling . Participants may experience discomfort, bruising and/or bleeding where the 
needle is inserted.  Occasionally, some people become dizzy, lightheaded or feel faint. Infection 
may occur on rare occasions.  To minimize these risks, blood will be drawn only by [CONTACT_619201] . 
 
• Genetic testing.  We will be assessing for presence of the APOE ε4  allele and potentially other 
cognitively or metabolically relevant genes in the future if new evidence comes to light that 
these might be important for understanding the results of the study. Genotype information will 
not be shared with study participants , as is currently recommended research practice for the 
gene and population we will be studying 49. Knowing genotype information will not provide any 
direct benefit to participants, but may cause anxiety. For example, the APOE ε4 allele is 
established as a risk fa ctor for late onset Alzheimer’s disease. However, it is not causal (you may 
have the allele and never get the disease), there is no known treatment or prevention strategy 
that targets the presence of the allele, and its predictive ability is diminished aft er the age of 70 
49. Therefore, knowing about the risk genotype cannot benefit the participant in terms of 
treatment, but may needlessly raise anxiety about cognitive decline.  
FEMME  
Protocol – V8.0  03/1 6/[ADDRESS_823074] based on genetic information alone 
as might be a concern for genome -wide studies.  
• Cognitive testing.  Participants will be asked to complete a short battery of co gnitive tests. The 
tests may be given orally, on paper, or on a computer. Participants will be informed that the 
testing in these visits is not intended or adequate for diagnostic purposes. Careful instructions 
will be given before the testing. There is a risk that some people may feel frustrated or worried 
when taking the tests. Participants will be encouraged to communicate with study staff if they 
are experiencing distress. Study staff will be trained to anticipate this risk and be alert for non -
verbal s igns of distress. Study staff and participants will both be instructed that testing may be 
discontinued at any time if the participant chooses.  
 
2.3.2  KNOWN POTENTIAL BENEFITS  
There are no anticipated short - or long -term benefits to an 8 -week administration of transdermal 17 β 
estradiol in postmenopausal women.  
 
2.3.3  ASSESSMENT OF POTENTIAL RISKS AND BENEFITS  
It is becoming clear that risks for cognitive decline may be different between the sexes. Even if overall 
risk is the same, it may be that , as in heart disease , different factors contribute risk to development of 
dementia. Evidence from animal work suggests that the effects of estrogen on bioenergetic pathways 
may be an important risk factor contributing to lo ng -term declines in glucose uptake in the bra in in 
women , a known precursor to Alzheimer’s disease, and a shift in bioenergetic fuel source to more 
reliance on ketone bodies.  This has implications both for administration of estrogen in healthy states, 
and in common metabolic diseases , such as T2D .  However, proof of this theory i n humans is entirely 
absent. A potential mechanism for interaction between common diseases and estrogen  is important , 
because it might lead to changes in the prescribing of estrogens.

conjugated equine estrogens increased risk for cognitive decline .50, [ADDRESS_823075] benefit of this study, r isks are temporary and reversible.  There is a 
body of literature that examined estrogen therapy as a means to prev ent Alzheimer’s disease . M ultiple 
studies were published in this age r ange with this or higher dosage, both transdermal and oral routes , 
but long er durat ion of estrogen administration .34-36, 52-54 Across these  studies, side effects were minimal 
until after 12 we eks of administration , which is 4 weeks longer than the proposed administration here . 
The study team has planned frequent monitoring to minimize risks further .

Protocol – V8.0  03/1 6/2021   10 OBJECTIVES  ENDPOINTS  JUSTIFICATION 
FOR ENDPOINT S 
To assess whether 8 -week 
administration of estrogen alters 
brain glucose and ketone body 
uptake in women with and without 
type 2 diabetes.  Brain uptake of glucose and ketone 
bodies using [F-18]FDG PET and  [C-
11]AcAc PET. Using PET tracers 
allows direct 
measurement of 
ketone and glucose 
uptake to the brain.  
Secondary    
To assess whether [ADDRESS_823076] scores in women 
with and without type 2 diabetes.  
 Composite scores of memory and 
executive function.  The cognitive tests 
selected are commonly 
used to assess for 
dementia and 
dementia risk.  
4 STUDY DESIGN  
 
4.1 OVERALL  DESIGN  
This is an investigation of the effects of transdermal estrogen administration on brain uptake of glucose 
and ketone bodies in postmenopausal women with and without T2D. The main hypothesis is that  
estrogen affects brain metabolism of ketone bodies and glu cose differently in women with T2D and 
those without, in accordance with the healthy cell bias theory of estrogen action.  All women will be 
tested before and after 8-week estrogen administration . It is a single -site study with two comparison 
groups: one wi th T2D  (n=10)  and one without  (n=10) . Randomization is not possible, as the comparison 
is between women affected and unaffected by T2D (and women cannot be randomized to have T2D). 
The study will include women of European American and African American desc ent and with Hispanic 
ethnicity in proportion to the local population for this age group.  No interim analysis is planned.

26% of people over the age of 651 and increases the risk for dementia by 50 -60%.[ADDRESS_823078] quartile of serum estrogen concentrations had 14 times the risk for dementia 
relative  to diabetic women with lower estrogen concentrations.18 Two recent papers from our group 
support this finding. Women with type 2 diabetes randomized to receive conjugated equine estrogen 
therapy in the Women’s Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS) had an increased risk for dementia 
and lower brain volumes.19, 20 
 
4.3 JUSTIFICATION FOR DO SE 
Women will receive 0.075 mg/day of transdermal estrogen delivered via a Climara patch. Serum 
estrogen levels will be measu red on day 3 of the second week of estrogen  administration to titrate 
levels as needed to att ain a circulating level of 50 -100pg/ml for each woman.  This dosage of estrogen 
was chosen because it is within physiological limits. Transdermal administration was selected over oral 
administration because this method of dosing better approximates physiological conditions than oral 
administration.

(Panhematin), lenalidomide (Revlimid), pomalidomide (Pomalyst), or thalidomide (Thalomid).  
 
As this study targets the effects of estrogen on brain post -menopause, men are excluded.  
 
5.3 SCREEN FAILURES  
Screen failures are defined as participants who consent to participate in the clinical trial but are not 
subseque ntly entered in the study. A minimal set of screen failure information is required to ensure 
transparent reporting of screen failure participants , to meet the Consolidated Standards of Reporting 
Trials (CONSORT) publishing requirements and to respond to queries from regulatory authorities. 
Minimal informat ion includes demography, screen failure details, eligibility criteria, and any serious 
adverse event (SAE).  
 
Individuals  who do not meet the criteria for participation in this trial (screen failure) because of a 
current medication, participation in another  trial, use of hormone replacement therapy within the past 3 
months, availability during study duration, or access to transportation  may be rescreened. Rescreened 
participants should be assigned the same participant numbe r as for the initial screening.  
 
5.4 STRATEGIES FOR RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION  
This single -site study aims to recruit 10 postmenopausal women with type 2 diabetes and 10 
postmenopausal without type 2 diabetes. All women should be between the ages of 60-80 years and 
may be of any race or ethnic ity. In the Winston -Salem, Forsyth County region , which  is the catchment 
area for this study, approximately 25% of people  in this age range identify as minority (primarily African 
America, less than 1 % identify as Hispanic ethnicity ). To reflect these demo graphics, we aim to include 
2-3 African American women in each arm of the study.  
 
We anticipate enrolling 1 -2 women per month and screening up to 200 women to reach enrollment. 
Women will be recruited through flie rs posted in the general public, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], and outpatient clinics; 
physician outreach in outpatient clinics; advertisement through the VITAL newsletter of the Section on 
Gerontology and Geriatric Medicine; community talks given by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_179167]; and word -of-mouth.  
Recruitment venues include Wake Forest Baptist Health and Wake Forest School of Medicine clinics, and 
public venues such as the YMCA, community centers, or churches . Recruitment of historically under -
represented populations, such as Africa n American women, will be accomplished through outreach to 
the African American community through our Aging Center and engagement of historically African 
American churches in the area. The Aging Center has a strong history of enrolling 25% or more African 
American participants in research studies.  
 
Study retention will be facilitated by [CONTACT_619203].   
 
6 STUDY INTERVENTION  
 
6.1 STUDY INTERVENTION  ADMINISTRATION  
 
6.1.1  STUDY INTERVENTION  DESCRIPTION  
Participants will be administered 0.075 mg/day of transdermal estrogen via a Climara patch for 8 weeks.  
FEMME  
Protocol – V8.0  03/1 6/2021   13 6.1.2  DOSING AND ADMINISTRATION  
The starting dose of estrogen will be 0.075 mg/day administered transdermally with a Climara patch. 
Serum estrogen levels will be measured 48 -96 hours (2 -4 days) after administration of the  second patch 
to titrate levels as needed to at tain a circulating l evel of 50 -100pg/ml for each woman. Patches will be 
changed weekly.  A higher dose may be administered at the study physician’s discretion if the minimum 
circulating level is less than 50pg/ml.  Conversely, the dose may be lowered at the study physician’s 
discretion if the circ ulating level is greater than 100 pg/ml. If advised by [CONTACT_5989], additional 
follow up measures of serum estrogen levels may be collected at appropriate time points.  
 
Participants will be instructed to change their patch week ly. A study coordinator will contact [CONTACT_619204]. If a patch change is missed, the participant will be instructed to cha nge it as 
soon as possible. If a participant goes 7 days without changing a patch, they will be withdrawn from the 
study.  
 
Short -term (less than 12 weeks) administration of estrogen has low risk of side effects. Participants will 
be screened thoroughly to exclude participants with existing risk factors for estrogen treatment. 
Participants will be contact[CONTACT_619205] a series  of questions to screen for potential adverse side effects .  As the intervention is 
being administered as an experimental manipulation, not treatment, if participants experien ce 
concerning side effects, they will be encouraged to discontinue use of estrogen , contact [CONTACT_619206],  and the study physician will be notified.  
 
6.2 PREPARATION/H ANDLING/ STORAGE/ ACCOUNTABILITY  
 
6.2.[ADDRESS_823081] STORAGE AND STABILITY  
It is recommended by [CONTACT_619207] 66 -77°F, with 
excursions in temperature allowed between 59°F and 86°F. The patch should be applied immediately 
after removal from the protective pouch.  
 
6.2.4  PREPARATION  
The Climara patch will require no additional preparation.  
 
FEMME  
Protocol – V8.0  03/1 6/2021   14 6.3 MEASURES TO MINIMIZE BIAS : RANDOMIZATION  AND BLINDING  
As this is a study to experimentally manipulate estrogen levels in women with and without type 2 
diabetes, t here is no randomization or blinding.  
 
6.4 STUDY INTERVENTION  COMPLIANCE  
Compliance will be monitored through serum tests of estradiol levels at baseline, week 2 of estrogen 
administration, and follow -up. Compliance will also be monitored through weekly phone calls with study 
staff. If participants miss 7 days of patch wearing , they may be asked to discontinue the study.  
 
6.5 CONCOMITANT THERAPY  
For this protocol, a prescription medication is defined as a medication that can be prescribed only by a 
properly authorized/licensed clinician. Medications to be reported in the Case Repor t Form ( CRF) are 
concomitant prescription medications, over -the-counter medications and supplements . Participants will 
be excluded for taking metformin or insulin , other hormone replacement therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] , dantrolene 
(Dantrium, Ryanodex, Revonto) , Viekira Pak (ombitasvir -paritaprevir -Ritonavir -dasabuvir), carfilzomib 
(Kyprolis) , tranexamic acid (Cyklokapron, Lysteda), hemin (Panhematin), lenalidomide ( Revlimid), 
pomalidomide (Pomalyst),  or thalidomide (Thalomid).

should take 14 days of 5 mg/day of progestin to minimize the risk of potential endometrial stimulation, 
and those who withdraw or are asked to discontinue will be followed appropriately.  Remaining study 
procedures , such as the follow -up blood draws and PET scans  should  not be completed , as they will not 
be useful to answer the research question and will expose the participant to risk .   
 
If a participant withdraws from the study, study staff will contact [CONTACT_619208] -up (i.e., administration of progestin) and to collect any unused Climara patches. The 
same procedure will be followed if the participant is requested to discontinue the study for 
noncompliance or any other  reason.  
 
The data to be collected at the time of study intervention discontinuation will include the r eason for 
withdrawal or discontinuation . 
 
7.2 PARTICIPANT  DISCONTINUATION /WITHDRAWAL  FROM THE STUDY  
Participant s are free to withdraw from participation in the study at any time upon request.  
An investigator may discontinue  or withdraw a participa nt from  the study for the following reasons : 
 
FEMME  
Protocol – V8.0  03/1 6/2021   15 • Significant study intervention non-compliance. Examples of significant non -compliance include 
missing 7 days of estrogen administration , not communicating with study staff for 3 weeks, and 
canceling or not showing up for 2 scheduled study visits.  
• If any clinical adverse event (AE), laboratory abnormality, or other medical condition or situation 
occurs suc h that continued participation in the study would not be in the best interest of the 
participant . 
• If the participant  meets an exclusion criterion (either newly developed or not previously 
recognized) that precludes further study participation . 
• Participant unable to receive the Climara patch  for [ADDRESS_823083] to follow -up if they do not return phone calls fro m study staff for 3 
weeks and/or cancel or  do not attend  [ADDRESS_823084] be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required study visit:  
• Study staff  will attempt  at least twice per week  to contact [CONTACT_619209]. If the participant is reached, staff will  counsel the participant on the importance of 
maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascertain if the participant wishes to and/or should 
continue in the study.  
• If study staff phone calls are not returned for at least 1.[ADDRESS_823085] study staff and reminding them of the need for follow -up (if 
applicable).  These contact [CONTACT_619210]’s medical record 
or study file.  
• If study staff phone calls are not returned for [ADDRESS_823086] that they 
communicate within th e next week so that we can follow -up medically if appropriate.  
• Should the participant  continue to be unreachable, he or she will be considered to have 
withdrawn from the study with a primary rea son o f lost to follow -up. 
 
Lost to follow -up will be minimized by [CONTACT_619211], 
remuneration of the participant for completing study visits, and weekly contact [CONTACT_85551].  
 
[ADDRESS_823087] visit  will be a screening visit  (SV) to determine if participants meet criteria for enrollment.  
Screening will be completed [ADDRESS_823088] during screening:  
• An IRB -approved written informed consent will be completed prior to any data collection  
• Collection of anthropometric information (height, weight, blood pressure)  
• Fasting blood draw  (complete bl ood count (CBC), HbA1c , metabolic panel,  lipid panel ) 
• For non -diabetic women, an Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT)  to assess for diabetes status  
FEMME  
Protocol – V8.0  03/1 6/2021   16 • Eat a healthy snack  
• Demographic and contact [CONTACT_3031]  
• Montreal Cognitive Assessment  
• Centers for Epi[INVESTIGATOR_67905] (CESD -10) 
• Detailed self -report health history and review of medications , specifically including smoking 
status, history of h ormone replacement therapy, medical conditions that are contraindicated for 
estrogen use (listed below under chart review) , and radiation exposure in the past year . 
• Review of medical record to confirm no evidence of potential contraindications to participate . 
Specifically, chart review will confirm that relevant screenings such as pap smear and 
mammogram have bee n completed in compliance with USPTF recommendations  and were 
negative; assess for a history of the following: unexplained vaginal bleeding, breast cancer, 
ovarian cancer, blood clots, stroke, myocardial infarction, liver disease, kidney disease, 
hypothyro idism, endometriosis or fibroids, porphyria, lupus, migraines , or tobacco use.  Chart 
review will also be used to confirm the participan t is not taking contraindicated  medications .  
 
Between 1 -30 days after the screening visit, the results of the screening will be reviewed with the study 
physician to determine eligibility. If the study physician is traveling for an extended period, she may 
delegate screening review to another physician  during that time.  The participant will be notified 0 -10 
days after eligibility is determined and remaining visits will be scheduled as needed.  
 
The second visit will be study visit 1 (V1) . V1 will take place [ADDRESS_823089] approximately 2  hours : 
• Fasting blood draw  for future research , serum estrogen, cortisol, glucose, and insulin levels  
• Snack  
• Cognitive testing . Cognitive testing will include assessment of executive function, working 
memory, reaction time, epi[INVESTIGATOR_619177] a combination of 
handwritten and computerized tests that can be accomplished in less than 60 minutes.  
• [ADDRESS_823090] visit will be study visit 2 (V2) . V2 will take place  preferably [ADDRESS_823091]  during V2:  
• Dual tracer PET scan  during which time blood draws will take place to assess ketone bodies 
(betahydroxy butyrate (BHB))  
 
At the conclusion of V2, participants will be given 8 Climara patches. Written instructions for using the 
patches will be provided and reviewed verbally by [CONTACT_464].  Participants may begin estrogen 
administration after the PET scan or within 48 hours after completing the PET scan, confirmed by a 
phone call with the study coordinator. Participants will wear a Climara patch for transdermal estrogen 
administration for 8 weeks, changing the patch weekly.  
 
Study visit 3 (V3) , the fourth visit,  will take place 48-96 hours (2 -4 days) after administration of the 
second estrogen patch  and will consist of a blood draw (not fasting) to assess serum estradiol  levels  and 
genetic assessment [CH1] Assay levels will be returned within 1 week . If levels are less than 50pg/ml or 
greater than 100 pg/ml, they will be provided to the study physician for review. The study physician will 
FEMME  
Protocol – V8.0  03/1 6/2021   17 then determine whether the dosage of transdermal estrogen should be increased or decreased to attain 
the desired range of serum estrogen, and if further blood draws are necessary to asses s serum estrogen 
levels.  
 
Study visits 4 (V4) and 5 (V5)  will take place during week [ADDRESS_823092] during 
V4:

DETAILS OF PET SCAN  METHODOLOGY  AND  PROCEDURES  
 
Method of assay and instrumentation. The radioactive drug will be assayed in a Capi[INVESTIGATOR_619179]. The capi[INVESTIGATOR_619180].  
 
Radioactive drug chosen . [18F]Fluorodeoxyglucose (or FDG) is often used in both research and clinical 
settings as a surrogate of glucose metabolism. In Alzheimer’s disease, use of [18F]FDG is a powerful 
technique providing a signature [CONTACT_619227]. The 
metabolic changes seen in Alzheimer’s disease are evident even in preclinical stages of the disease 56. 
Thus, lending this technique to applications in understanding the impa ct of brain glucose metabolism 
and disease progression. [11C]Acetoacetate (or AcAc) is a novel radiotracer with primary applications in 
study of acetoacetate or ketone body metabolism.  
We will use an established method of production for [11C]AcAc that has  been used in other institutions, 
including by [CONTACT_619214]. Stephen Cunnane, PhD, Université de Sherbrooke 32, 33, 57-60. The 
production of this radiotracer is published and an automated synthesis and injection un it has been 
established at WFU PET center. The utilization of both [11C]AcAc and [18F]FDG in an established dual -
tracer PET scan may provide valuable insight  into impaired brain metabolism, how impaired brain 
metabolism is linked with cognitive decline, an d how it  may be modified by [CONTACT_619215] .

• Visual inspection (clear and colorless solution without presence of particulate matter)  
• Radiochemical purity >90%;  
• Demonstration of sterility and apyrogenecity.  
 
Quality of radioactive drug . We will synthesize [11C]AcAc  as described in our local drug master file 
(LDMF) and batch record sheets located in the radiopharmaceutical laboratory and attached to this 
application. Final product [11C]AcAc will have:  
• A radiochemical purity of >90%  
• Sterility and apyrogenicity te sting performed as described in LDMF and will be recorded in 
batch record files.  
[18F]FDG is an FDA approved drug and will be obtained from an FDA approved radiopharmacy.  
 
PET scan procedure.   
• Subjects will report to the ground floor of the MRI building to the Molecular Imaging 
Research PET/CT scanner at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center.  
• Vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, temperature) and body weight will be within 30 
minutes of radiotracer injection.  
• An indwelling catheter will be placed int o a forearm vein in both arms.  
• 30 minutes prior to the PET scan, a heating pad is wrapped around one arm (44 degrees 
Celcius). Up to 10mL of blood for Glucose, AcAc, and Beta -hydroxybutyrate (or BHB, the 
other major ketone body) quantification. This bloo d is stored on ice and immediately 
processed for analysis after the PET scan.  
 
Part 1 of Scan (0 -30 minutes):  
• Prior to PET acquisition, a low dose CT scan of the head will be obtained for attenuation 
correction.  
• Patients will be injected with an intravenous bolus of up to 5 -10mCi (370 MBq) (+/ - 10%) of 
[11C]AcAc (over 2 minutes). This is the standard dose used in published clinical  studies using 
[11C]AcAc (3 -5).  
• The PET acquisition will begin immediately after the tracer injection and last for a total of [ADDRESS_823096] [11C]AcAc tracer injection. This will be used for quantification of radiation  
estimates throughout the scan -period.  
 
Washout Period (30 -60 minutes):  
• A washout (“ washing”) period will occur from [ADDRESS_823097] tracer has been excreted prior to 
injection of the [18F]FDG  tracer and second part of the dual -tracer scan.   
 
Part 2 of Scan (60 -120 minutes):  
• Prior to PET acquisition, a low dose CT scan of the head will be obtained for attenuation 
correction.

(over 20 seconds). This is the standard dose used in published clinical  studies using [18F]FDG 
(3-5).  
• The PET acquisition will begin immediately after the tracer injection and last for a total of 60 
minutes.  
• 2ml of blo od will be sampled from the forear m vein at 3, 8, 16, 24, 35, and  [ADDRESS_823098]

throughout the scan -period.  
 
General Procedures:  
• Patients will be positioned in the PET/CT scanner by [CONTACT_32341]. Subjects will be monitored 
via audio microphone  and video. During PET imaging, subjects must remain as still as 
possible and thus every effort will be made to provide for their comfort including blankets, 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_619181]. The dual -tracer [11C]AcAC/[18F]FDG PET brain imaging 
procedure is similar to that used by [CONTACT_619216] (3 -5). 
Scanning will begin with a standard low dose CT transmission scan of the head that will be 
used  to correctly position the patient and for attenuation correction. For the [11C]AcAc scan 
brain emission images will be acquired continuously for a 30 minute period. For the 
[18F]FDG scan brain emission images will be acquired continuously for a [ADDRESS_823099] an additional 
20 minutes of continuous imaging.  
• From the time of first trac er injection until after the whole imaging session is complete, 
patients will be observed continuously for signs of adverse events or serious adverse events. 
The injection site will be observed for excessive inflammation or damage to the surrounding 
tissue .  
• A physician or a person designated by [CONTACT_619217].  
• Study participants will be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] 24 -72 hours aft er they are injected with 
[11C]AcAC/[18F]FDG to inquire if any adverse events occurred within [ADDRESS_823100], the study physician or a proxy physician will be notified 
immediately to determine appropriate next steps. If the participant reports vaginal bleeding, this will be 
reported to the  study physician and the participant will be advised to follow up with their primary care 
provider.

All adverse events ( AEs) must have their relationship to study intervention  assessed  by [CONTACT_237357]/her clinical judgment. 
The degree of certainty about causality will be graded using the categori es below.  
 
• Definitely Related  – There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and other possible 
contributing factors can be ruled out. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test 
result, occurs in a plausible time relationship t o study intervention  administration and cannot be 
explained by [CONTACT_9153]. The response to withdrawal of the 
study intervention  (de-challenge) should be clinically plausible. The event must be 
pharmacologically or phenomenologically definitive, with use of a satisfactory rechallenge 
procedure if necessary.  
• Probably Related  – There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and the influence of other 
factors is unlikely. The clinical event, in cluding an abnormal laboratory test result, occurs within 
a reasonable time after  administration of the study intervention , is unlikely to be attributed to 
FEMME  
Protocol – V8.0  03/1 6/2021   21 concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals, and follows a clinically reasonable response on 
with drawal (dechallenge). Rechallenge information is not required to fulfill this definition.  
• Potentially  Related  – There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g., the event 
occurred within a reasonable time after administration of the trial med ication). However, other 
factors may have contributed to the event (e.g., the participant ’s clinical condition, other 
concomitant events). Although an AE may rate only as “possibly related” soon after discovery, it 
can be flagged as requiring more informat ion and later be upgraded to “probably related” or 
“definitely related”, as appropriate.  
• Unlikely to be related  – A clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, whose 
temporal relationship to study intervention  administration makes a causa l relationship 
improbable (e.g., the event did not occur within a reasonable time after administration of the 
study intervention ) and in which other drugs or chemicals or underlying disease provides 
plausible explanations (e.g., the participant ’s clinical condition, other concomitant treatments).  
• Not Related  – The AE is completely independent of study  intervention  administration, and/or 
evidence exists that the event is definitely related to another etiology. There must be an 
alternative, definitive etiolog y documented by [CONTACT_15370]. ] 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  EXPECTEDNESS  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or study physician  will be responsible for determining whether an adverse event ( AE) is 
expected or unexpected.  An AE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of 
the event is not consistent with the risk information previously described for the intervention.  This 
study includes administration of transdermal estrogen . According to the package in sert, e xpected risks 
when administering estrogen s include the list below.  
 
Less common but serious:  
• Breast cancer  
• Cancer of the uterus  
• Stroke  
• Heart attack  
• Blood clots  
• Dementia  
• Gallbladder disease  
• Ovarian cancer  
 
Warning signs of serious side effects:  
• Breast lumps  
• Unusual vaginal bleeding  
• Dizziness and faintness  
• Changes in speech  
• Severe headaches  
• Chest pain  
• Shortness of breath  
• Pains in your legs  
• Changes in vision  
• Vomiting  
 
Common side effects:  
FEMME  
Protocol – V8.0  03/1 6/2021   22 • Headache  
• Breast pain  
• Irregular vaginal bleeding or spotting  
• Stomach/abdominal cramps, bloating  
• Nausea and vomiting  
• Hair loss  
 
Other side effects:  
• High blood pressure  
• Liver problems  
• High blood sugar  
• Fluid retention  
• Enlargement of benign tumors of the uterus (“fibroids”)  
• Vaginal yeast infection  
 
It is worth noting that these are risks for administration of any estrogens and for long duration. Many of 
these risks were established from the Women’s Health Initiative Study, a landmark study that used long -
term oral administration of conjugated equine estrogens. Reported risks from research using short -term 
administration of transdermal estradiol have been minimal.34-36, 52, 54 
8.3.4  TIME PERIOD AND FREQUENCY FOR EVENT ASSESSMENT AND FOLLOW -UP 
The occurrence of an adverse event ( AE) or serious adverse event ( SAE) may come to the attention of 
study personnel during study visits and interviews of a study participant  presenti ng for medical care, or 
upon review by a study monitor.  
 
All AEs including local and systemic reactions not meeting the criteria for SAEs will be captured on the 
appropriate  case report form  (CRF). Information to be collected includes event description, ti me of 
onset, clinician’s assessment of severity, relationship to study product (assessed only by [CONTACT_21218] a diagnosis), and time of resolution/stabilization of the event. All AEs 
occurring while on study must be documen ted appropriately regardless of relationship. All AEs will be 
followed to adequate resolution.  
 
Any medical condition that is present at the time that the participant  is screened will be considered as 
baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if the stu dy participant’s condition  deteriorates at any 
time during the study, it will be recorded as an AE.  
 
Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event 
at each level of severity  to be performed. A Es cha racterized as intermittent require documentation of 
onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].  
 
Study staff  will record all reportable events with start dates occurring any time after informed consent is 
obtained until 7 (for non -serious AEs) or 30 days (for SAEs) after the last day of study participation.  At 
each study visit, study staff  will inquire about the occurrence of AE/SAEs since the last visit.  Events will 
be followed for outcome information unt il resolution or stabilization.  
 
8.3.5  ADVERSE EVENT REPORTI NG  
FEMME  
Protocol – V8.0  03/1 6/[ADDRESS_823101]’s health and safety. A description of the 
event and the date and location of the event will be recorded on the AE Reporting Form. Reported 
events will be compi[INVESTIGATOR_619182], unless it is a serious event that req uires 
more immediate reporting.  
• Unexpected fatal or life -threatening AEs related to the intervention will be reported to the IRB 
and NIA  within 3 days of the investigator becoming aware of the event.  Other serious and 
unexpected AEs related to the interv ention will be reported within 7 days.  
• Anticipated or unrelated SAEs will be handled in a less urgent manner but will be reported to 
the IRB and NIA on  an annual basis.    
• All other AEs documented during the course of the trial will be reported to the IRB  and NIA on 
an annual basis by [CONTACT_619218].  
 
8.3.[ADDRESS_823102] a real 
problem if a diagnostic scan is performed later. In this case, incidental findings can lead to unneces sary 
testing .  
 
Participants will be informed of study -related results under the following circumstances.  
• If a participant does not qualify for the study at screening, they will be informed why they did 
not qualify. If they did not qualify because a scree ning measure was out of range and may 
indicate an underlying health concern (incidental finding), that will be explained. The nature of 
incidental findings will also be reviewed with the participant.  
• When MRI scans are viewed for research purposes, incide ntal findings may be observed. In 
some cases, incidental findings may reveal a previously unknown health concern that it would 
benefit the participant to know about so that they can seek treatment. How ever, in our 
experience, s ome peo ple do not wish to be informed of MRI -related incidental findings. 
Therefore, during consent, participants will be asked if they wish to be informed of MRI -related 
incidental findings.  All of our MRI scans will be read by a board -certified neuroradiologist 
regardless to rule o ut major abnormalities or issues that might lead to scans being excluded 
from the study. If an incidental finding is noted and the participant has requested to be notified, 
we will contact [CONTACT_619219]. At the par ticipant’s 
request, we will share the research MRI scans with their physician.  
 
8.3.7  REPORTING OF PREGNANCY  
All women in the study will be postmenopausal.  
 
8.4 UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS  
 
8.4.1  DEFINITION OF U NANTICIPATED PROBLEMS (UP)  
 
FEMME  
Protocol – V8.0  03/1 6/2021   24 The Office for Human Research Prote ctions ( OHRP ) considers unanticipated problems involving risks to 
participant s or others to include, in general, any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the 
following criteria:  
 
• Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures that are 
described in the protocol -related documents, such as the Institutional Review Board ( IRB)-
approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the 
participant  population being studied;  
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means there is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_547147]); and  
• Suggests that the research places participant s or others at a greater risk of harm (including 
physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  
 
8.4.2   UNANTICIPATED PROBLEM REPORTING  
The PI  [INVESTIGATOR_619183] ( UPs) to the reviewing Institutional Review 
Board ( IRB). 
 
• Protocol identifying information: protocol title and number, PI’s name, and the IRB project 
number;  
• A detailed description of the event, incident, experience, or outcome;  
• An explanation of the basis for determining that the event, incident, experience, or outcome 
represents an UP;  
• A description of any changes to the protocol or other corrective actions that have been taken or 
are proposed in response to the UP. 
 
To satisfy the requirement for prompt reporting, UPs will be reported using the following timeline:   
 
• UPs that are serious adverse events ( SAEs) will be  reported to the IRB within 7 days  of the 
investigator becoming aware of the event.  
• Any other UP will be  reported to the IRB within 14 days  of the investigator becoming aware of 
the problem.  
• All UPs should be reported to appropriate institutional officials (as required by [CONTACT_17347]’s 
writte n reporting procedures), the supporting agency head (or designee), and the Office for 
Human Research Protections ( OHRP ) within 31 days  of the IRB’s receipt of the report of th e 
problem from the investigator.  
 
9 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS   
 
9.1 STATISTICAL HYPOTHESES  
Aim 1. Assess whether T2D alters cognitive response to 8 weeks of transdermal estrogen. Composite z-
scores will be calculated by [CONTACT_147572] a z-score for each cognitive task and summing z-scores for the 
tasks designated as Short -Term Memory (STM Composite) and Executive Function (EF Composite). We 
will assess differences in follow -up scores between intervention groups using ANCOVA after covariate 
adjustment for baseline scores  using SAS software .61 Because age, BM I, and education may influence 
changes in cognition over time (e.g. learning effects), we will assess whether including these as 
FEMME  
Protocol – V8.0  03/1 6/2021   25 covariates affects results. The primary outcomes will be the composite scores. Secondary analyses will 
examine individual compo nents.  
 
Aim 2. Assess whether T2D alters estrogen effects on brain uptake of glucose and ketone bodies in 
whole brain and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) related regions of interest. FDG and AcAc PET scan data will 
be analyzed with PMOD® Software using methods described by [CONTACT_93583].[ADDRESS_823103] (ROI) -based analyses. This will 
quantify absolute global an d regional uptake of FDG and AcAc to determine uptake, as well as uptake of 
AcAc relative to FDG to find potential areas of compensatory ketone use. T1 MRI images will be 
processed using publically available software in a customized workflow, primarily ANT s due to evidence 
of superior performance.62 Average values for ROI will be calculated for the posterior 
cingulate/precuneus, temporal lobe, and prefrontal cortices, as these are regions of observed decreases 
in FDG up take in AD and are relevant for development and progression of dementia . Inference will be 
based the same approaches as for cognitive data for 1) whole -brain glucose uptake, 2) whole -brain 
ketone uptake, 3) regional glucose uptake, 3) regional ketone uptak e, 4) whole -brain ratio of 
ketone/glucose uptake, and 5) regional ratio of ketone/glucose uptake. We will assess inter -
relationships among changes in these outcomes and with changes in cognitive function using principal 
components and canonical correlation . 
 
Alternate hypotheses. In addition to its effects on cellular bioenergetics, estrogen can affect vascular 
health.63, [ADDRESS_823104] included 
two MRI scans to assess vascular brain health: 1) a T2 -weighted FLAIR image to assess white matter 
hyperintensities, an indicator of small -vessel disease correlated with diabetes status a nd 
hypertension,65-67 and 2) a susceptibility -weighted image to assess for microbleeds.[ADDRESS_823105] after BMI adjustment, we plan to limit participants’ BMI range and match for B MI. 
We will also examine whether changes in BMI or diabetes treatment over follow -up affect results. 
Cortisol may be elevated in older adults with T2D, even after controlling for BMI69 and the presence of 
cortisol may modify the effects of estrogen on cognition.[ADDRESS_823106] for potential interactions between estrogen and cortisol. Due to the cyclical nature of cortisol 
secretion, all blood draws will occur between 8AM -10AM. OGTT data will allow us to use glucose and 
insulin l evels as covariates as needed. Drs. Mintz and Hughes are currently collecting pi[INVESTIGATOR_619184] [11C]AcAc scans. If these methods are successful, they 
will be incorporated into the final study.  
 
9.2 SAMPLE SIZE  DETER MINATION  
This is a  small, proof -of-concept study to determine whether it is feasible to measure effects of estrogen 
on brain metabolism using novel PET methods. For ethical (exposure to radiation) and financial reasons, 
it is not uncommon to limit sample s ize for PET studies. Previous work specifically examining the effects 
FEMME  
Protocol – V8.0  03/1 6/[ADDRESS_823107] that participant and reach the final sample size.  
 
9.4 STATI STICAL ANALYSES  
 
9.4.1  GENERAL APPROACH  
For all analyses, statistical significance will be defined as p<0.05. For all data, distributions will be 
viewed,  assessed for normality, and transformed if needed to conform to the requirements of the 
selected statistica l test.  
 
10 SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION AND OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
10.1 REGULATORY, ETHICA L, AND STUDY OVERSIGHT CONSIDERATIONS  
 
10.1.1  INFORMED CONSENT PROCESS

PARTICIPANTS  
Consent forms describing in detail the study intervention , study procedures, and risks are given to the 
participant  and written documentation of informed consent is required prior to starting 
intervention/administering study intervention .   
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  CONSENT PROCED URES AND DOCUMENTATION  
Informed consent is a process that is initiated prior to the individual’s agreeing to participate in the 
study and continues throughout the individual’s study participation.  The participant  will be asked  to 
read and review the IRB -approved consent form . Study staff will explain the research study to the 
participant  and answer any questions that may arise. A verbal explanation will be provided in terms 
suited to the  participant’s comprehension of the purposes, procedures, and potential  risks of the study 
and of their rights as research participants.  Participants will have the opportunity to carefully review the 
written consent form and ask questions prior to signing.  The participant  will sign the informed consent 
document prior to any proce dures being done for the study.  A copy of the informed consent document 
will be given to the participant s for their records.  
10.1.2  STUDY DISCONTINUATION AND CLOSURE  
This study may be temporarily suspend ed or prematurely terminated if there is sufficient reasonable 
cause.  Written notification, documenting the reason for study suspension or termination, will be

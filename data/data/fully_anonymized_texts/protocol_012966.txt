 1.0 INTRODUCTION   
 
1.1 Overview  
Cancer patients face numerous physical and emotional challenges. Anxiety and  depression can decrease 
quality of life and even decrease survival. High quality  cancer care depends upon recognizing and 
responding to patients’ emotional  needs. Unfortunately, oncologists frequently do not respond to 
patients’ emotional  concerns.  
Oncologists can learn to communicate better. The most successful teaching occurs  in intensive courses 
with patient actors. However, these courses take time and are  expensive. We created a computerized 
program called SCOPE , Study of Communication in Oncologist Patient Encounters , in whi ch 
oncologists  audio record conversations with real patients and then receive feedback on how  well they 
did. Oncologists who used this program in a research study doubled how  often they responded to 
patients’ emotional concerns and increased their patients’  trust.  
We will take this p rogram and add an additional feature in which real patients also listen to the 
conversations and give feedback to these doctors.  We will then have doctors who are being recertified in 
oncology by [CONTACT_502424].  We will test how well it increases their patients’ satisfaction in their communication,  and 
whether it improves their communication skills.  
If successful, this intervention will represent an effective communication tra ining  program for physicians 
in which they improve their communication skills through  direct feedback from patients. Because of the 
integration with the ABIM  Maintenance of Certification Program, if fully adopted into that program, it 
could  have an extraor dinary impact on thousands of physicians and their patients.  
 
1.2 Background and Rationale : 
People living with cancer suffer greatly and the burden is greatest on those with advanced disease.   
Cancer patients experience extraordinary physical, emotional, and existential challenges, and up to 60% 
acknowledge difficulty copi[INVESTIGATOR_502408].1-3  Among patients with advanced disease, 25% describe 
their suffering as moderate to extreme.[ADDRESS_647130] source of this distress, and up 
to 70% of patients with advanced cancer experience pain severe enough to impair function.5-7  Emotional 
suffering can be profound as well, as patients experienc e fear, anger, sadness or isolation.  Psychological 
distress, particularly anxiety or depression, is common in all cancer patients, with a reported prevalence 
between 30 -50%.2,8-[ADDRESS_647131] understand the nature of the illness, its pr ognosis and the available treatment options.  A

 patient’s emotional state, ability to comprehend prognostic data, and how oncologists discuss these data 
all affect the understanding of medical information.  Fearing the loss of hope, patients frequently cop e by 
[CONTACT_502425]’s import.31  Patients may be incapable of processing the 
information they hear,32,33 which in turn decreases message encoding and recall.  Emotion affects 
processing; people who are in negative moods may pay more attention to how messages are given than to 
the content of the messages.34,[ADDRESS_647132], patients may be less likely to understand oncologists’ 
messages.  When patients are emotionally distressed, they cannot process informatio n well and 
decision -making suffers.  
 
Patients feel better when they express emotional concerns and their physicians respond 
empathically.  Disclosure of emotional concerns helps patients in two ways.  First, the expression of 
emotional concerns is therapeu tic in itself.  The self -disclosure literature demonstrates a variety of 
positive outcomes associated with expressing personally stressful experiences.[ADDRESS_647133] cancer, emotional expression reduced somatic symptoms 
and medical visits.42  Patients assign tremendous symbolic importance to their physician and the quality 
of communication.43  When oncologists respond empathically to patients’ emotions, patients report 
higher satisfaction and better adhe rence.[ADDRESS_647134] of physician compassion on viewers' anxiety.  They found that women with breast cancer who 
saw the "enhanced compassion" videotape were significantly less anxious after watching it than women 
in the other group.45  Second, cancer patients with unresolved concern s are more distressed than those 
whose concerns are resolved.46-49  Oncologists can only respond to patients’ concerns that they  hear, and 
90% of patients say they want to talk to their doctors about these issues.50,51  Oncologists  can promote 
these discussions by [CONTACT_502426]’ emotional concerns.  In addition, techniques such as active 
listening, using open -ended questions and emotional words, and responding appropriately to patients' 
emotional cues assist in their express ion.52  When oncologists encourage their distressed patients to 
express their c oncerns and then respond appropriately, they help relieve patient suffering and create 
an environment conducive to improved decision -making.  
Effective patient -centered communication improves multiple patient outcomes.  Outside of the 
cancer setting, patien t-centered communication has been shown to influence malpractice claims,53 patient 
satisfaction,54 recall of information,55 and clinical outcomes such as diabetic glucose  control and 
functional status.56,57  Among cancer patients, quality of communication affects psychological well -
being, with “patient -centered” co nsultations leading to improved satisfaction and psychological 
adjustment.58  Empathic communication re duces patient anxiety and decreases long -term distress.44,45 
Finally, communication techn iques that focus on patients’ emotional states are more likely to elicit 
patients’ concerns about pain or other symptoms, which can then be treated.  All aspects of a patient’s 
care are enhanced with improved communication.  
Effective communication is open, honest and patient -centered. According to Epstein and Street, 
“patient -centeredness” includes four core components: (1) eliciting and understanding the patient’s 
perspective, (2) understanding the patient’s psychosocial con text, (3) achieving a shared understanding of 
the problem and its appropriate treatment in the context of the patient’s preferences and values, and (4) 
  Improving Communication Between Cancer Patients & Oncologists: 05/07 /[ADDRESS_647135] been proposed for specific tasks such as delivering bad 
news, discussin g disease progression and talking about palliative care.61-67 68,69 70 Patient -centered 
communication is respectful, empathic, inclusive, and efficient, seeks to elicit patients’ goals and 
preferences, and to match these to  an individualized plan of care.  
Oncologist -patient communication often does not meet experts’ standards.  Unfortunately, a large 
literature documents that physicians generally, and oncologists specifically, often do not meet the 
accepted quality standard s for communication.43,51,65,71-75  Physicians rarely talk with seriously ill patients 
about their goals, values or even tr eatment decisions.76-83  Oncologists commonly do not elicit the full 
range of terminally ill cancer patients’ concerns, or attend to patients’ affect.[ADDRESS_647136] or not attending 
to patients’ emotions.85  As a result, cancer patients tend to disclose few er than 50% of their concerns to 
oncologists and other providers.85,[ADDRESS_647137] bad news 
revealed that they tended to use closed rather than open -ended questions, and infrequently asked about 
psychosocial concerns.74 In another study, only one of five oncologists' assessments of patients’ distress 
correlated accurately with patients’ self -repor t.75  A study from the Netherlands of audio -recorded 
encounters between oncologists and patients receiving palliative chemotherapy observed that physicians 
devoted 64% of their conversation to medical/technical issues and only 23% to health -related quality of 
life issues.87  Patients’ emotional functioning and fatigue were not addressed 54% and 48% of the time, 
respectively.  
We conducted the SCOPE Trial  (Study of Communication in Oncologist Patient Encounters; R01 
CA100387, Tulsky, PI, Pollak, Arnold, and Farrell, Co -I’s) to analyze emotion handling in patient -
physician communication and to develop an intervention  for physicians.88  In the initial observational 
phase, we audio -recorded 398 conversations between 51 oncologists and 270 patients with advanced 
cancer in two cities.  We found that patients disc losed emotional concerns in only 37% of these 
conversations, fewer than expected given the known high prevalence of distress.89 When patients did 
express negative emotions (e.g., anxiety, fear), oncologists responded empathically only 27% of the time.  
Patients l ikely stop expressing their concerns when they learn they will not receive a helpful response. 
Several oncologist characteristics were associated with their communication style.  Oncologists who used 
more empathic statements were younger than those who did  not.  Also, oncologists who responded 
empathically were more likely to describe themselves as socioemotional rather than technical in their 
orientation to medical care (80% vs. 45% respectively, p=.03).  Of note, g ender was related to the 
number o f empath ic opportunities; female patients seen by [CONTACT_502427] (p=.03), suggesting that oncologist behavior (women oncologists use more empathic 
language) affects the expression of concerns.89  
Oncologists’ may not address patients’ emotional  concerns for several reasons.  Constructs in social 
cognitive theory,90 the transtheoretical model of behavior change,91 and a barriers model proposed by 
[CONTACT_502428]92 may explain oncologists’ behavior.  They may be unaware that they are neglecting patients’ 
emotional concerns, lack the skills to address patients’ co ncerns, feel that addressing their concerns will 
not improve patients’ well -being (outcome expectations), lack the confidence to address patients’ 
emotional concerns (self -efficacy), or be unmotivated to improve their communications skills (readiness 
to ch ange).  Also, external barriers such as patient factors (e.g., patients giving indirect rather than direct 
emotional cues93) and environmental factors (e.g. , lack of time or resources) may deter oncologists from 
  Improving Communication Between Cancer Patients & Oncologists: 05/07 /18

 addressing patients’ emotional concerns.  A significant gap exists between the idealized model of 
oncologist -patient communication and the reality of practice. Behavior change theories explain 
oncolog ists’ communication patterns, and may be employed in interventions to improve these 
behaviors.  
Training can improve clinician communication.  Although physicians frequently regard the ability to 
communicate as an inborn talent, these skills can be learned.   With one exception,[ADDRESS_647138] shown positive results when interventions incorporate adult 
learning principles, practice, and feedbac k in settings supervised by [CONTACT_660].  The American 
Academy on Physician and Patient (AAPP) first developed the model for such training with a [ADDRESS_647139] of course length, Levinson and Roter found that physicians 
completing a 2.5 -day course asked more open -ende d questions and more frequently asked patients’ 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_502409] a half day course.[ADDRESS_647140] to asthma led to shorter 
physician -patient encounters and to more favorable patient  responses to physicians’ actions.98 
This training model has been used in oncology as well.  Baile conducted a series of half -day workshops 
focused on giving bad news an d managing difficult patients99 and found increased confidence in 
communicating bad news a nd managing problem situation cases after the workshops.  Parle and Maguire 
conducted multi -day workshops in the [LOCATION_006] for oncology clinicians that demonstrated improved self -
assessed ratings of performance in communication tasks and improvements in behaviors  with 
standardized patients.64  Fallowfield, also in the [LOCATION_006], conducted a randomized controlled trial of a 3 -day 
training course involving 160 oncologists from across the country.100,101  She found that, in addition to 
favorably altering oncologists’ attitudes and beliefs towards psychosocial issues, the course resulted in 
improved communication behavior in videotaped patient interviews.[ADDRESS_647141] developed several programs to train physicians to recognize better patients’ 
psychological distress and to respond empathically.  An eight - hour communication skills course for 
medical house staff improved their ability to deliv er bad news and respond to emotional cues in 
standardized patient evaluations.[ADDRESS_647142] created the leading communication skills training program 
for oncologists, OncoTalk, originally designed as an intensive four -day communication retreat for 
oncology fe llows.104  Based on smal l group learning using role play and feedback, we demonstrated 
significant improvement in fellows’ empathic communication behaviors.[ADDRESS_647143] importantly, 
participants found it transformed their practice, and the model has been replicated across the U.S. and 
overseas. Communication skills such as eliciting concerns, handling emotions, and demonstrating 
empathy, can  be taught and lead to increased physician self -confidence and reduced patient distress.    
  Improving Communication Between Cancer Patients & Oncologists: 05/07 /[ADDRESS_647144] many practicing oncologists to take the time from 
their busy practices to undergo such training.  Practicing clinicians need a more flexible model to fit 
communication skills training into their busy live s.  
The SCOPE program – a widely disseminable online alternative to the face -to-face course.  We 
recognized this need for alternative evidence -based educational venues that are easily accessible, not 
disruptive to clinical practice, inexpensive, and brief.   We developed SCOPE, a computerized, 
interactive, tailored program that teaches oncologists basic communication skills and allows them to 
review their own audio -recorded encounters and provides suggestions on how to respond better to 
patients’ negative em otions.  SCOPE uses the principles found to be effective in face -to-face retreats and 
incorporates them into an online tool that can be efficiently used in the privacy of an oncologists’ home 
or office.[ADDRESS_647145] 
the opportunity to practice and receive feedback on their own conversations .  Furthermor e, employing 
the Social Cognitive Theory model described above,90,92 SCOPE addresses oncologists’ self -efficacy and 
outcome expectations, and provides ongoing coaching and encouragement to overcome barriers to 
learning and adopting new skills.   
The original SCOPE program was comprised of five modules: (1) Principles o f Effective 
Communication ; (2) Recognizing Empathic Opportunities ; (3) Responding to Empathic Opportunities; 
(4) Conveying Prognosis ; and (5) Answering Difficult Questions .  A final module summarized main 
points from the intervention.  Each module was desi gned to be viewed in [ADDRESS_647146], barriers to learning the material were addressed.  Then, the new communication 
skill was introduced, and demonstrated in one or two video clips.  Important teaching points were 
summa rized and, finally, users were asked to review selected excerpts from their own previously 
recorded conversations.  These excerpts were accompanied by [CONTACT_502429] (e.g., “Great job, try to 
use more statements like that!” or “Next time, you may want t o try saying….”).  Oncologists were then 
asked to commit to using a new skill with their patients in the future, and they were sent email reminders 
of this commitment prior to their next clinic sessions.  
In a randomized, controlled trial, we tested SCOPE’ s efficacy with 48 oncologists and 264 patients.107  
The program was well accepted. Twenty -one of 24 in the intervention group reported using the CD -ROM 
with a median usage time of  64 minutes. More importantly, 92% of the oncologists reported changing 
their clinical practice as a result of what they learned in SCOPE.106  Oncologists in the intervention arm 
used more empathic statements (RR =1.9; 95% CI, 1.1, 3.3; p=0.02) and were more likely to respond to 
negative emotions empathically (OR = 2.1; 95% CI, 1.1, 4.2; p=0.03) compared to control arm 
oncologist.  Most importantly, patients of intervention oncologists reported higher trust compared with 
patients of control oncologists (estimated mean difference = 0.1; 95% CI, 0.0, 0.2; p=0.04).107  After one 
hour of training with the SCOPE program, oncologists improved their skills and increased their patients’ 
trust, findings almost as robust as seen in multi -day workshops. The SCOPE program, an innovative, 
computerized appr oach to teaching communication skills based on the same principles as face -to-face 
courses, can achieve similar results to these courses, yet be integrated into the everyday practice of a 
  Improving Communication Between Cancer Patients & Oncologists: 05/07 /[ADDRESS_647147].  SCOPE offers an inexpensive, practical and dissemi nable alternative to 
communication workshops.  
The Enhanced SCOPE Program – Capturing the  patient’s voice in the medical encounter.  In the 
SCOPE program, medical visits between oncologists and patients are recorded, uploaded to a server, and 
using an appli cation called ENCOUNTER, are coded by [CONTACT_502430] (e.g., patient expressions of negative emotion, empathic responses by [CONTACT_339473], 
etc).  These results are then given back to the oncologists, togethe r with tailored feedback on specific 
examples.   
For this project we have created the Enhanced SCOPE Program.  Rather than having the coding done 
only by [CONTACT_21171], we will involve patients in the feedback process.  The recorded encounters 
will a lso be reviewed by [CONTACT_502431] (not the oncologists’ own patients) who will listen to the 
recordings and directly insert their own “subjective” feedback.  Physicians rarely are given the 
opportunity to hear what patients truly think about thei r communication style.  The Enhanced SCOPE 
Program provides oncologists with both objective coded feedback and a sense of how real patients 
react to their communication, thus “using the patient’s voice” to improve the medical encounter.   
The American Board  of Internal Medicine (ABIM) Maintenance of Certification Program – A 
model for integrating Enhanced SCOPE into clinical practice.  All ABIM board -certified medical 
specialists (certified within the past 25 years) are required to enroll and complete the Ma intenance 
of Certification (MOC) program requirements if they wish to retain this important credential.  The 
framework and evidence for the MOC program are well -established.108,109  A physician’s 
association with the MOC program occurs over a number of years and involves completing a 
series of steps including educational modules and an exam.  An important and unique component 
of this program is the Practice Improvement Module (PIM), in which recertifying physi cians 
conduct a quality improvement exercise using patients and data from their own practices.  There 
are a number of different PIM’s to choose from and, currently, one of these is a communication 
module.  Physicians who select this module ask a sample of their patients to complete the  
Clinicians and Groups -Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CG -CAHPS) 
satisfaction survey, receive a report of the survey results as feedback , and then design and 
complete a performance improvement plan bas ed on these results.  When they are done with their 
performance improvement plan,  CAHPS surveys  are collected again from a different sample of 
patients .  The MOC program offers a unique opportunity to integrate the Enhanced SCOPE 
program into a process alr eady familiar to (and required of) board certified internists and 
subspecialists.  As an alternative to the current communication PIM, physicians could audio 
record conversations with their patients using their smart phone (the app is already developed), 
these conversations would be coded and reviewed by [CONTACT_502432], and the physicians 
would then work through the SCOPE modules, including receiving feedback on their 
conversations.  We have engaged in a strong partnership with ABIM around researching  this idea 
that allows us to take advantage of the powerful ABIM MOC platform.   
 This collaboration meets the longstanding goal of ABIM to be able to truly evaluate and impr ove 
communication quality, and the intervention can be widely disseminated that could transform 
patients’ experiences with their physicians.  
 
  Improving Communication Between Cancer Patients & Oncologists: 05/07 /[ADDRESS_647148] is to improve communication between  oncologists and their patients 
by [CONTACT_502433]’s voice is heard in the  medical encounter. Thus, we hop e to improve the 
experience for patients living  with cancer. We seek to accomplish this goal by [CONTACT_502434] -recorded  conversations. The 
feedback will come from two sources: 1 ) Professional research  assistant coders who will identify 
objective learning opportunities based on specific  coding criteria and 2) Trained patient reviewers who 
will listen to the recordings  and offer their own, subjective feedback at key moments in the encounters.  
We will address the following specific aims:  
Aim 1:  Identify barriers to implementing the ENHANCED SCOPE app. & website in participating  
oncology practices. Barriers include: oncologist enrollment, patient enrollment and transmission of data.  
Aim 2:  Compare the effect of the Enhanced SCOPE program to the standard  communication Practice 
Improvement Module (PIM) on patient satisfaction with  oncologist communication as measured by [CONTACT_502435]-CAHPS survey.   
Aim 3:  Compare the effect of the Enhanced SCO PE program to the standard  communication PIM on 
oncologist communication behaviors, including their  use of empathic responses to patient emotional 
concerns, as coded from  audio -recorded medical encounters.  
 
3.[ADDRESS_647149] SELECTION   
The study will involv e the recruitment and consent of three types of subjects: (1) board -certified 
oncologists who practice in any setting in the [LOCATION_002] and have a smartphone; (2) patients receiving 
care from these oncologists  who are willing to complete an anonymous su rvey; and, (3) patients 
receiving care from these oncologists who are willing to be audio recorded.    
Inclusion criteria: Eligible patients who will be recorded will have metastatic cancer, (those patients who 
take the survey can have cancer of any stage) be at least [ADDRESS_647150] 4  
patient interactions will be eligible for randomization to study conditions.  
Exclusion criteria:  Oncologists who do not speak English to their patients, patients who do not spe ak 
English, o ncologists who do not have enough patients with advanced cancer . DFCI oncologists are 
excluded from this study; this includes DFCI satellite sites, non -DFCI DF/HCC sites, and other non -
DF/HCC sites that are under the DFCI IRB.  
DF/HCC Standard Operating Procedure for Human Subject Research Titled Subject Protocol 
Registration (SOP #: REGIST -101) must be followed.  This project has been granted decentralized 
  Improving Communication Between Cancer Patients & Oncologists: 05/07 /[ADDRESS_647151] of Internal Medicine (ABIM) Maintenance 
of Certification (MOC) program. All oncologists involved with the MOC program are eligible for the 
study and will self -refer through the ABIM website, which will house a description of the study and 
invite participation. Additionally, ABIM will contact [CONTACT_502436] m. Oncologists interested in participation may 
review detailed information about the study on the website and contact a study representative at Dana 
Farber Cancer Institute or ABIM with questions. Oncologists who express interest will be invited to 
registe r and assigned an individual sign -in code. They will enter the online Communication Practice 
Improvement Module (PIM) using their code, read and sign an electronic consent form, and complete the 
registration process. Once enrolled, the oncologist will recr uit [ADDRESS_647152] one clinic visit  each (using a secure smartphone application) .  Doctors 
will be informed about the importance of privacy while using their smartphones, and will be given 
information explaining how to keep their recordings private and secure.  The security measures  are as 
follows:  
As a participant in the SCOPE study, the oncologist will audio record up to [ADDRESS_647153] procedures to ensure the privacy and security of these audio 
recordings, and it is the oncolog ists’ responsibility to do the same. They will follow these guidelines for 
using the recorder app:  
1. Keep your phone secure:  
- Use only your personal phone, not a shared phone or device.  
- Set your phone’s built -in locking feature to require a passcode, fingerprint, or other identification 
method each time the phone is used.  
- Choose a hard -to-guess passcode and change it periodically and whenever you think it may have been 
compromised.  
- Set your phone to automatically lock after a period of inactivity.  
- Keep your phone up -to-date with the latest operating system.  
2. Keep your recorder app passcode secure:  
  Improving Communication Between Cancer Patients & Oncologists: 05/07 /[ADDRESS_647154] your passcode has been compromised, change it immediately.  
3. Use the recording app securely:  
- Quit or switch out of the app when n ot in use, it will lock automatically when you do this.  
- Use the app’s lock function when you need to leave the app running unattended.  
- Be aware of the physical environment in which you use the app. If you listen to a recording, make sure 
it cannot be h eard by [CONTACT_2312].  
A total of 4 patient visits (with different patients) will be recorded prior to oncologist randomization and, 
after oncologists have completed the Enhanced SCOPE intervention or the control Communication 
Module, they will audio -record anoth er 4 patient visits (with different patients from the pre -intervention). 
For those oncologists enrolled in the SCOPE intervention, an additional [ADDRESS_647155] the 
oppor tunity to ask questions during the consent process or in the future should they arise later. After 
expressing their willingness to participate, the caregiver (s) will be sent a link via text or email to an 
  Improving Communication Between Cancer Patients & Oncologists: 05/07 /[ADDRESS_647156] their care, now or in the future. Patient s 
and caregivers will be encouraged to ask questions during the consent process or in the future should 
they arise later. After expressing their willingness to participate, study staff will ask the patient  or 
caregiver to complete the electronic consent on  the iPad provided to the physician or sign and date the 
physical copy of the consent form and hand it back to their physician. The physician will then fax the 
signed consent form to study staff who will in turn sign and date the consent form. Study staff will fax 
the completed consent form back to the physician who will give it to the consented patient  or caregiver 
for their records . After that point, the visit may be audio recorded.   
In the case that study staff are present at the physician’s clinic at th e time of consenting, study staff will 
talk the patient or caregiver through the consent process in person. They will then hand the patient or 
caregiver an iPad with the appropriate electronic consent form pulled up or a physical copy of the 
consent form a nd ask them to complete it. Once the consent has been completed, the visit may be audio 
recorded.  
 
5.0 STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS  
 
5.1 Design/Study Type : 
Interventional: Randomized controlled trial  
5.2 Selection of Instruments:  
CG-CAHPS survey:  Patient satisfaction with  communication  – the primary outcome of this trial is the 
effect of the enhanced SCOPE program on patient satisfaction with communication, as measured by [CONTACT_502435]-CAHPS survey .111,[ADDRESS_647157] twelve months.  The CG -CAHPS survey is com prised of 
questions that encompass 3 major composites (access to care, doctor communication, and courtesy of 
staff) and two global rating items. All composites have been shown to yield acceptable individual level 
internal consistency reliabilities (Cronbac h’s alpha >= 0.77), as well as practice level reliabilities 
  Improving Communication Between Cancer Patients & Oncologists: 05/07 /18 
   
 
11 
 (Cronbach’s alpha >=0.75). In addition, all composites were significantly correlated (P<0.01) with the 
global rating items, demonstrating construct validity of the measures . These studies were use d in the 
SCOPE study. It should take about [ADDRESS_647158] of Internal Medicine, the Intercluster Correlation Coefficient 
(ICC) is used as a reliability index for measures colle cted within physician practices such as patient 
ratings or quality measures of care. The ICC measures the stability of patient ratings based on the 
average ratings of the patient samples within physicians.  This reliability measure increases with sample 
size, as does the precision of the average ratings.  The ABIM employs a very high standard of reliability 
for high -stakes assessments (e.g., certification examinations) of 0.85, so has in the past used a survey 
sample size of 35, which provides reliabilities  that range from 0.85 to 0.91 (Figure 1). For the purpose of 
this study and in an effort to recruit somewhat fewer patients, we are willing to accept a slightly lower 
(yet still outstanding) reliability of approximately 0.80. As seen in Figure 1, this can be achieved with a 
sample size of 25, and we will use this for the study.  
Figure [ADDRESS_647159] surveys  – oncologists will complete brief surveys at baseline (demographics) and after 
completion of the practice improvement module (feedback on the module).  These data will be collected 
directly online through the portal of the Enhanced SCOPE website.  This su rvey was used in the SCOPE 
study and it should take about 5 minutes to complete. For continuous and ordinal variables  (e.g.,  age, 
years in practice) comparisons will use the Wilcoxon rank -sum test.  For categorical variables  (e.g.,  sex, 
race, practice sett ing) comparisons will use Chi -square tests. These hypothesis tests are intended for data 
monitoring and quality control . 
The relevant scale used from CAHPS that is treated as continuous is derived the Provider 
Communications composite in our study . The communications composite consists of six items relating to 
frequency of events during interactions between the provider and the patient from the patient’s 
perspective. Each of these items are rated on a 1 to 6 scale (never to always) so the raw score  is the sum 
of these ratings. The score range in this case is [ADDRESS_647160] errors of approximately ± 2 points.  

  Improving Communication Between Cancer Patients & Oncologists: 05/07 /[ADDRESS_647161] of Internal Medicine (ABIM) Mainte nance Of Certification (MOC) process. 
Oncologists who choose to enroll in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_502410] (PIM) will , as described 
above,  complete a baseline questionnaire, send out satisfaction surveys  to a sample of their patients, and 
then audio record (using a smartphone application ) four clinic visits with four  different patients. 
Oncologists who are assigned to the control arm will receive the results of the patient surveys and be 
asked to conduct a quality improvement activity that responds to  the survey feedback (the current 
“standard” communication PIM) . They will be offered several resources for upgrading their 
communication skills and asked to describe their study plan and the success in its completion. Physicians 
randomized to the control  arm will be given the opportunity to conduct  the SCOPE training after study 
completion. Oncologists assigned to the intervention arm will receive the survey feedback as well as the 
enhanced SCOPE program which provides an online interactive didactic learn ing platform and  provides 
tailored feedback on their own audio -recorded encounters. The feedback will come from two sources: 1) 
Professional research assistant coders who will identify objective learning opportunities based on specific 
coding criteria (e.g ., empathic opportunities, use of open -ended questions) and 2) Trained patient 
reviewers who will listen to the recordings and offer their own, subjective feedback at key moments in 
the encounters. These patient reviewers will be drawn from our stakeholder  partners and are active 
patient advocates. They will be treated as members of the research team, paid for the reviews, and are not 
patients of the study physicians.  After completing the SCOPE online module, intervention group 
oncologists will audio -record  two more clinic visits and receive another round of tailored feedback as a 
“booster.” One month after completing the intervention or control arm processes , oncologists in both 
arms will audio record another four clinic encounters and collect another batch  of [ADDRESS_647162] information for study  staff for 
those interested in taking advantage of this opportunity . We will require permission from the physician 
before planning a visit . Participating physicians are not required to accept a visit from study staff .

In addition to testing the feasibility of all the components of the study, this pi[INVESTIGATOR_502412] (ICC) per measure, re sponse frequencies 
for survey items, standardized mean differences in the patient survey composites, and estimates of group 
rate ratios of the number of empathic responses per number of empathic opportunities . These data will be 
used to re -evaluate our ini tial values used powering the study and to revise any procedures that will 
improve the quality of the information collected.  
Below,  we describe the components and technical processes of th e SCOPE  intervention.  All technical 
and design work related to app and website development will be performed by [CONTACT_502437], Inc., the 
Durham based firm led by [CONTACT_502438], MPH.  They developed SCOPE,  the AVA  audio coding 
software, and a number of other applications used in projects with Drs. Tulsky, Pollak, Arnold, and Back.  
Educational Content  - SCOPE is comprised of five modules that build sequentially upon one another: 
1) Principles of effective communication; 2) Recognizing empathic opportunities; 3) Responding to 
empathic opportunities; 4) Conveying prognosis; and 5) Responding to difficult question s.  The 
principles and mnemonics taught in these modules are derived from the OncoTalk communication skills 
training program.104,105  Although the SCOPE program identifies oncologists’ opportunities for 

  Improving Communication Between Cancer Patients & Oncologists: 05/07 /18 
   
 
14 
 improvement, the overall “tone” of the program is positive and supportive.  It uses the language of 
motivational interviewing, stresses how difficult these conversations are f or clinicians, states that 
shortcomings are ubiquitous among physicians, and praises and encourages positive behaviors when 
identified.  Each module includes an introduction to the topic, teaches several concrete skills with video 
demonstrations, provides audio clip examples from the oncologists’ own conversations of when they 
used the skills and opportunities where they could have used the skills if they did not, and offers tailored 
audio feedback encouraging more use of positive behaviors, less use of unh elpful ones, and alternative 
approaches to employ when missed opportunities are detected.  In addition to the objective coded data 
and examples, oncologists will also receive examples with feedback selected by [CONTACT_502439]. Finally, each m odule concludes with action steps to which the oncologist commits, and about 
which they will receive an email reminder in the near future.   
Oncologist -Patient Encounter Audio Recording  - Oncologists will audio record their patient 
encounters using a smart phone application specifically developed for this purpose.  Upon enrollment, 
providers will receive an email message with links to install the smartphone app. The app is compatible 
with both iOS (iPhone) and Android operating systems. Possession of a compa tible smartphone will be a 
criterion for study enrollment. Prior to recording, oncologists will identify potential patients and provide 
them with a flyer prompting them to call study staff at DFCI. Patients will call study staff who will then 
explain the s tudy to patients and provide a website link via text message directing them to an electronic 
consent and HIPAA authorization form that they will then sign. To record an encounter, the physician 
simply launches this easy -to-use app and taps “record.”  At th e end of the recording, physician s tap a 
“stop” button  and can choose to immediately upload the recording to the “cloud” review platform, or to 
upload it later (e.g., if they don’t have a current internet connection). Delivery status of each recording is 
prominently noted and the physician will be reminded later to upload the recording.  Participating 
oncologists will be given detailed instructions in using the app (although it is quite simple and intuitive), 
reminded that all data transfer is HIPAA complia nt, and that study staff will be available by [CONTACT_502440] .  
Professional “Manualized” Coding  - Study staff will code recorded encounters using the AVA  
software program developed by [CONTACT_502441] [ADDRESS_647166] through transcript -based coding alone.  Coders 
identify segments within each recording and apply codes to each segment, with related sub -codes being 
applied to each code as appropriate.  For example, a patient utterance such as “I’m so scared” would be 
coded as an “empathic opportunity,” and a subsequent drop -box would allow it to be coded as a direct 
(rather than indirect) example of this.  The coding rules are highly detailed, and our experience from the 
prior SCOPE studies as well as from numerous other project in our shop is that we can train coders to 
achieve high i nter-rater reliability with kappa scores greater than 0.[ADDRESS_647167] codes.  After the two 
coders are trained, each will code approximately half of the conversations.  In addition, they will both 
code approximately 15% of the encounters to make sure there is  no coder drift.  This technique results in 
very rich data that provides a view into specific provider communication at multiple points in each 
encounter.  
Trained Patient Review - Patient reviewers : We believe that the most powerful example of 
engagement in this research is the patient clinic visit audio recording review with their feedback being 
given to the oncologists.  This allows the patient’s voice to be heard directly by [CONTACT_15370].  These 
reviews will be conducted by [CONTACT_502442], our Patient Advisory Council 
  Improving Communication Between Cancer Patients & Oncologists: 05/07 /[ADDRESS_647168] not already been completed. Once an encounter is 
opened, an audio playback interface will allow users to play, pause and seek through the recording. At 
any point during playback, the reviewer will be able to pause and insert a comment as a voice memo 
(spoken by [CONTACT_146978]) or typed message. Upon completion, the reviewer will be able to inspect and 
modify inserted comments and ultimately mark the review as complete. The app will be designed to be 
immediately intuit ive and to walk the reviewer through the review process. Reviewers will be trained in 
usage of the app and study staff will be available to provide technical support through email and phone.  
Each conversation will be reviewed by [CONTACT_502443].  Pri or to conducting any reviews, [CONTACT_502464], a national expert and trainer in motivational interviewing, will train all patient reviewers.  The 
purpose of this training will be to help reviewers understand how to frame their comments in behavioral 
language th at is likely to be better understood and internalized by [CONTACT_502444] (e.g., “I liked the way 
you said, ‘That must be tough’ – it showed that you really heard what the patient was saying” rather than, 
“You sounded really caring there.”).  While the pati ent perspective is essential and we need to retain their 
“voice” in this feedback, we are also aware that diffuse or overwhelmingly negative feedback is likely to 
trigger resistance, thus making the patient reviews counterproductive.  We are certain that w e can strike 
the proper balance with the very high quality patient partners we have recruited to this study.  
Coders and patient reviewers will be contracted by [CONTACT_262956]. They will receive privacy and security training 
and will follow all DFCI policies and proc edures related to accessing study data and maintaining privacy 
and security. Recordings and other data will not be transferred to the coders and patient reviewers. They 
will access recordings only through the AVA web -based coding program, using an encrypte d SSL 
connection. Their access to data will be limited to the recordings themselves and non -personally -
identifying ID's used to refer to the recordings. All professional staff coders and patient evaluators will 
be HSP certified.  Patient evaluators will be  logged into a database by [CONTACT_502445].  Staff will ensure that 
each evaluator has completed the HSP training. All training certificates will be stored in the Regulatory 
Binder.  
Coded Data Review and Recorded Example Selection  - Study staff will be notified  when coding (by 
[CONTACT_502446]) has been completed for each encounter.  Data from manualized coding 
will be inspected by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Pollak who may reject, accept, or modify specific coding.  Based on prior 
experience managing similar review pro cesses, initial encounters will require regular checking and 
discussion with review ers and coders. This will serve  as a quality improvement step that leads to better 
review and coding over time, ultimately resulting in very little need for checking these d ata prior to their 
usage in the online training.  There will be no more than two examples given for each skill taught.  
Similarly, staff will examine patient reviewer comments and where necessary clarify these through 
discussion with the reviewer.  Specifi c comments may be edited to better reflect reviewer intentions, and 
voice memos may be converted to text when a voice memo needs to be adjusted.  Up to three patient 
reviewer comments per encounter will be selected for presentation to the oncologist. We ha ve found in 
prior work that too much feedback can be overwhelming and physicians are most likely to act on small 
amounts of focused feedback.   
Online Provider Training  – After all of an oncologist’s recorded encounters have been collected and 
coded, the d ata will be transferred to an individually tailored web/mobile -based training program.  A 
  Improving Communication Between Cancer Patients & Oncologists: 05/07 /[ADDRESS_647169] who will be notified via email. The program 
will include all of the components described in the “Educational Content section”, including  individual 
feedback on providers' own recorded encounters.  For the manualized coding, each coded oncologist 
behavior will match with a feedback response from a sample library of choices.  For example, when an 
oncologist misses an empathic opportunity, we will provide a sample empathic response.  Oncologists 
will receive patient reviewer comments either in writing or verbally, along with clips from the encounters 
to which those comments are directed. Feedback will reward provider s for demonstrated skills and 
identify deficiencies with concrete suggestions to improve communication in those areas.  
The training program will be designed for use on multiple platforms, including computers, tablets, and 
smartphones. The interface will b e intuitive, with emphasis on quick digestion of content. Physicians can 
work through modules in a linear fashion or follow their own preferred trajectory using a menu system. 
They will be encouraged to visit all content, and completion will be clearly ind icated through a progress 
meter and map showing completed and incomplete sections. Past experience suggests most users will 
complete the intervention in a single setting, but users will have the opportunity to complete it over 
multiple sessions and to retu rn to already completed content at any time.  The training program will track 
usage at the page/screen level, allowing for detailed analysis of each  provider's dose and usage trajectory. 
An administration panel will allow research staff to track physician usage.  
Study Feasibility : We believe this program is feasible because of the resources we have to conduct the 
trial. Both interventions the SCOPE program and the Subspecialty Communications Practice 
Improvement Module (PIM) have been field -tested. SCOPE wa s evaluated in a previous randomized trial 
(107) and the Subspecialty Communications has been operational in the Maintenance of Certification 
(MOC) program at the ABIM  for more than [ADDRESS_647170] 10,500 patient surveys. This will be more than adequate to cover the 
trial of 120 oncology practices. Finally, the incentives of 40 MOC points out of the required 100 points 
for to maintain c ertification , 40 CME credits,  and a small payment of $75 per physician should enhance 
our ability to accrue physician participants for the study.   
5.4 Data Collection  
Four types of data will be collected in this study: oncologist surveys, patient surveys, onc ology visit 
audio recordings, and Enhanced SCOPE program usage data  
 
Oncologist surveys – oncologists will complete brief surveys at baseline (demographics) and after 
completion of the practice improvement module (feedback on the module). These data will be collected 
directly online through the Enhanced SCOPE website, described below and will be stored on the SCOPE 
server. All oncologists, whether assigned to the intervention or control arm, will navigate the study via 
this site. Survey data do not contain  PHI or other patient data. These da ta will be transferred securely to 
ABIM for analysis together with the other data.  
  Improving Communication Between Cancer Patients & Oncologists: 05/07 /18 
   
 
17 
 Patient surveys – the only survey data collected from patients is from the anonymous CAHPS surveys 
administered through ABIM. Patients w ill be identified by [CONTACT_502447] a copy of the 
survey that on the cover sheet offers  two different options through which to complete the survey. One 
option is automated interactive voice response (IVR), in which the patient calls a toll -free telephone 
number and enters an identification number for their oncologist, and is directed through a survey by a 
computerized system. The second option is to complete the survey via an anonymous online portal, for 
which the patient is given the URL and t he oncologist identification number. These data, too, will reside 
only at ABIM. The surveys are linked to the oncologist, but otherwise have no identifiable data or 
protected health information . We are request ing a waiver of written consent to collect the anonymous 
survey data via CG -CAHPS from patients who receive care from participating oncologists. We believe 
this is the best way to protect patient confidentiality, as the only linkage between the survey data and the 
patients would be the informed consent  document. This way, the data remains truly anonymous. Patients 
will not have the option of completing surveys on paper, thereby [CONTACT_502448] -copy data.  
Oncology visit audio recordings – the clinic visit recordings  will be collected via the AVA application as 
described below and will reside on the AVA servers. Through review and coding of these recordings 
using the AVA application, additional “code” data will be generated and will be stored on the same AVA 
servers. These code data do not contain PHI or PII and are stored separately from the audio recordings. 
The code data includes data collected from both the patient and from the caregiver(s) during the audio 
recorded clinic visit. The data extracted from the recordi ngs is dependent on the oncologists, their 
responses, and their communication. The coded data are not differentiated into “patient” and “caregiver” 
data; all codes are categorized only by [CONTACT_502449]. Therefore, all data collected from the patient or from 
the caregiver(s) during one audio recorded visit will be considered one set of data. The code data 
(without recordings), will be transferred securely to ABIM for analysis together with the other data. 
Portions of the visit recordings will be available for o ncologists to review as part of their usage of the 
Enhanced SCOPE website, with each oncologists having access only to their recordings (the recordings 
of their own clinical encounters). These partial recordings will be stored on the SCOPE server.  
 
SCOPE p rogram usage – the Enhanced SCOPE website will track oncologist usage, generating common 
usage data including login times and content viewed, and will be stored on the SCOPE server.  Usage 
data do not contain PHI or other patient data. Usage data, will be transferred securely to ABIM for 
analysis together with the other data.  
 
 Long -term storage of Data  
Data stored on the SCOPE server and AVA servers will reside there only for the periods they are 
required to be there for study usage. Data will be securely removed from these servers on a per -item basis 
(as users complete the study their data will be remov ed, rather than waiting for all users to complete the 
study). Removed data will be securely transferred to DFCI servers for long -term storage.   
 
The Enhanced SCOPE Website  
  Improving Communication Between Cancer Patients & Oncologists: 05/07 /18 
   
 
18 
 The Enhanced Scope website is custom website developed for the study. The website a nd associated data 
will be hosted on a HIPAA -compliant server managed by [CONTACT_502450] (armor.com), a HITRUST -certified 
HIPAA hosting and data management provider.  
The AVA Application  
The AVA application is a commercial product that will be licensed by [CONTACT_1758] f or use to collect and 
code audio recordings. AVA includes a SaaS web application that is used to manage and code audio 
recordings, generate reports, explore recordings and data, and compi[INVESTIGATOR_502413]. AVA 
also in cludes an iOS recording app that transfers recordings directly to the AVA servers (instead of using 
a general purpose audio recorder app). AVA and associated data are hosted on HIPAA -compliant servers 
managed by [CONTACT_502450] (armor.com), a HITRUST -certified HIPAA hosting and data management provider.  
 
5.5 Description of Study Process  
5.51 Instrument Administration:  
All instruments in this intervention will be self -administered. [PLEASE SEE SECTION 5.4 “DATA 
COLLECTION” for further details about the surveys and recordings.]  
Once o ncologists have enroll ed, they have [ADDRESS_647171] 
satisfaction surveys from  a “convenience sample ” of [ADDRESS_647172] (using a 
smartphone application) four  clinic visits with four different patients.  Within [ADDRESS_647173] a quality improvement 
activity that responds to the feedback (the current “standard” communication PIM). Oncologists assigned 
to the intervention arm will have [ADDRESS_647174] an additional two clinic visit s to receive a “booster” of feedback after the online 
training. One month after reviewing their feedback, oncologists in both arms will audio record another [ADDRESS_647175]  satisfaction surveys  from  a new sample of patients.   
5.52 Intervention Ad ministration:  
The ABIM provides electronic information to potential oncologists and those doctors self -select to join 
the project. Oncologists enroll, consent online, choose their own patients , then proceed with the 
intervention at their own pace with the use of the online function and smartphone applications. D octors  
continue with this process until they finish their section , the i ntervention lasts the length of the study.  All 
technical and de sign work related to smart phone application and website development will be performed 
by [CONTACT_502437], Inc., the Durham based f irm led by [CONTACT_502438], MPH. Data from manualized 
coding will be inspected by [CONTACT_6283]. Tulsky and Pollak and these doctors will also train patient reviewers to 
code the audio recordings.  
5.53 Special Concerns  
  Improving Communication Between Cancer Patients & Oncologists: 05/07 /[ADDRESS_647176] only electr onic data and anonymous data when 
possible. Also, mobile recording devices/applications will be designed with security measures in mind. 
Only the minimum amount of PHI necessary will be collected from study subjects, including oncologists 
and patients, and  all data will be transmitted via secure, institutionally approved methods . 
5.54 Compensation  
Physicians will be incentivized to participate by [CONTACT_26777] 40 MOC points (twice what  is usually awarded 
for completing a Practice Improvement Module) , 40 CME credits,  and a $[ADDRESS_647177] their MOC 
fee.

Additionally, all research staff will be Human Subjects certified.     
 
6.0 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
6.1 Primary and secondary Aims:   
The overarching goal of this project is to improve communication between oncologists and their patients, 
and thus improve the experience for patients living with cancer. We hope to accomplish this goal by 
[CONTACT_502452] -recorded 
conversations. We hope to accomplish the following specific aims:  
 
  Improving Communication Between Cancer Patients & Oncologists: 05/07 /18 
   
 
20 
 Aim 1:  Identify barriers to implementing the ENHANCED SCOPE app. & website in participating  
oncology practices. Barriers include: oncologist enrollment, patient enrollment and transmission of data.  
 
Aim2 : Compare the effect of the Enhanced SCOPE program to the standard Communication Practice 
Improvement Module (PIM) on patient satisfaction with their oncologist’s communication as measured 
by [CONTACT_502453] -CAHPS.  
 
Aim 3: Compare the effect of the Enhanced SCOPE program to the standard PIM on oncologist 
communication behaviors, including their use of empathic responses to patients’ emotional concerns, as  
coded from audio - recorded medical encounters.    
 
 6.2 Sample size and statistical power or precision associated with the sample size  
We considered several outcomes for power calculations to determine study sample sizes, number of 
physicians and number of patients within physician practices. All power calculations were completed 
using the PASS© power analysis 116The study assumptions for  the power calculations follow:  
• Intervention: SCOPE (Studying Communication in Oncologist –Patient Encounters) program  
• Active control: Subspecialty Communications Practice Improvement Module program  
• Type I error rate ≤ 
  = .05, two -tailed test  
• Power  to detect minimally important difference in means, rates or odds ratios ≥ (1 -β) = .8  
• Analyses will involve random effects models comparing intervention and control groups with 
respect to mean differences, the odds ratios, or rate ratios.  
• Sample alloca tions between treatment groups will be 1:1  
• Mean differences in continuous variables (e.g. mean patient satisfaction with communication 
score) will be assessed using a random effects, ANCOVA with covariates 117, 118, 119Minimally 
important differences bet ween groups (in standardized units SD) reviewed included: .[ADDRESS_647178] sizes of 
CME program a  2009 Cochrane Collaboration review  of 30 randomized trials investigating the 
effects of CME on professional practice and healthcare outcomes (versus no CME), the median 
risk difference (RD) was 6% (IQR: 1.8% to 15.9%). Assuming equal sample sizes and a baseline 
  Improving Communication Between Cancer Patients & Oncologists: 05/07 /18 
   
 
21 
 risk of 70%, a standardized difference effect size equivalent to a 6% RD is approximately . 14 (0.4 
to .33) SD . 
• Odds ratios for categorical or ordinal variables (e.g. groups differences between items or rating 
scales from CAHPS survey) will be assessed using a random effects logisti c regression 121These 
minimally important effect sizes between groups reviewed for power calculations included 2.0 
and 2.5 and were based in previous research by [CONTACT_502454] 107Based on estimates from 
previous Communications PIM performance at the A BIM, we assumed Physician performance 
from the PIM would be about .7 for binomial variables.    
• Between group rate ratios of the number of empathic responses per number of empathic 
opportunities will be assessed using a random effects Poisson regression 122Minimally important 
rate ratios based on previous research of Duke investigators 107reviewed included: 2.[ADDRESS_647179] to patient 
conversation.  
• The data will have clustered structure with patient responses or physician conversations nested 
within oncologists. The expected intra -cluster correlation (ICC) is .1. The assumed v alue of the 
ICC is based on the observed average intra -cluster correlations from patients samples of CG -
CAHPS surveys of physicians completing the Subspecialty Communications Practice 
Improvement Module program at the ABIM and is consistent with ICC values  reported nationally 
for the CG -CAHPS 3 . 127. 
• Cluster sizes reviewed include 4 for analyses of outcomes from physician audio recording 
Possion and 25 per physician for analysis of outcomes from patient responses to CG -CAHPS 
composites.   
• It is expected that there we be no more than a 16% loss to follow -up among participating 
physicians over the duration of the study so an initial sample of [ADDRESS_647180] likely reasons for  dropouts expected include 
physicians not completing the data collection requirements before randomization or failing to 
complete in the communication improvement activities of the study arms.    
Based on these assumptions, we determined that 100 physician s with 4 patient audio recordings at 
baseline (before randomization) and post -intervention and [ADDRESS_647181] -intervention were suitable for our study objectives. Table 1 shows 
the twelve study scenarios t hat we determined sample size requirements. One hundred physicians 
(50 per study arm) met or exceeded sample size requirements each of the study outcomes 
reviewed. The proposed study size: [ADDRESS_647182] 80%

6.3 Stratification factors and intervention allocation plan for randomized studies:   
All participating oncologist s who are enrolled in the ABIM MOC program, complete Practice 
Characteristics Survey, complete baseline patient surveys of at least [ADDRESS_647183] 4  
patient interactions will be eligible for randomization to study conditions. The randomiza tion of 
physicians will occur at the ABIM. The responsible statistician at ABIM  will use a computer program for 
randomization. The randomization process will involve stratifying participants by [CONTACT_502455] (about 12/month) as they enter  the project. Because of the administration time required to 
score the baseline audio recordings, physicians will be assigned in time blocks to accommodate the flow 
of work. Total expected time to accrue physician participants is about [ADDRESS_647184] on design:         Per Group  Total

 At Baseline, participating oncologists will complete a background questionnaire covering the flowing 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102]:  
• Oncologist demographics:  At baseline, oncologists will be asked their age, gender, race, 
ethnicity and religion.  
• Oncologist experience:  At baseline, oncologists will be asked the number of years they 
have been in practice and the number of hours they spend in direct patient care.  
• Oncologist communication training:  At baseline, physicians  will be asked about prior 
communication skills training they have received in medical school, residency, fellowship and 
practice.  
• Oncologist socioemotional orientation: At baseline, physicians will be asked [ADDRESS_647185] the technological and scientific aspects.129  In the SCOPE Trial, these were 
found to be strong predictors of physician likelihood to use empathic responses. Because 
participating oncologists are enrolled in the ABIM MOC program, administrative data from 
ABIM records will be used to supplement information from the questionnaire particularly training 
and certification performance. ABIM records may also serve to validate resp onses to the study 
questionnaire or serve as imputation sources in the event of incomplete responses.  
The questionnaire data will be used to assess whether certain training, demographic, or personal 
characteristics serve as moderating variables to the treatment effects. Many to these variables will serve 
as covariates in the ANCOVA analyses or if there are  complex interactions observed, the analyses may 
include blocking respondents using one or more of these variables interactions.

NA, there are no plans for early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_68660].  
6.6 Definition of and all owance in design for unevaluable/ineligible participants:  
Unevaluable participants will include those physicians who do not complete the baseline data collection 
requirements before randomization. These individuals will not be allowed to participate in th e trial. 
Individuals who do not complete both the baseline and re -measurement portions of the study are not 
eligible to receive the 40 MOC points towards their certification status nor will they receive the $[ADDRESS_647186] for these incomplete records.          
6.7 Analysis plan:   
The study design for analyses purposes is what Murray [ADDRESS_647187] the variation of the time by [CONTACT_502456] & Oncologists: 05/07 /[ADDRESS_647188] Control Group design used in the study. The only  difference in the expected 
means squares shown in Table 2 and those from an adjusted (baseline or post -intervention) analyses is 
the reduction in the degrees freedom from the either the group level covariates or patient level covariates 
along with the eff ects of the covariates removed from the mean squares.  
The analyses of the secondary outcome, oncologists ’ empat hic response to patient and caregiver 
expressions of negative emotions, a rate variable, proceeds in the same manner as the primary outcome. 
The difference between the two analyses is that the general linear model for the average score outcome 
uses a normal error linear model while the linear model for the secondary rate function follows an 
Poisson distribution with a log link function, thus the er ror terms for the two analyses have different 
distributions but the same data analyses design.   
The differences we are measuring are the treatment arm differences in physician post -test scores 
controlling for pre -test scores that is,  the differences betwee n post -intervention mean and baseline mean 
for the SCOPE intervention to the same difference for the Communication PIM while partialling out the 
effects of relevant covariates. We compare test for effect 1 (Intervention, shown in Table 2) to that for 
test of 4 (time by [CONTACT_502457] 2)

There are several assumptions that apply to the models discussed  124.  First, variables adjusted in the 
analyses are assumed to have a straight -line relationship with the outcome measures. This assumption 
may be assessed by [CONTACT_502458]. If 
  Improving Communication Between Cancer Patients & Oncologists: 05/07 /[ADDRESS_647189] or the Akaike’s and Schwarz’s criteria statistics. The fit statistics of the various 
models may be plotted as a function the number of model parameters to suggest whether adding th ese 
terms for assumption testing is reasonable. All analyses will be conducted using the SAS® statistical 
software, version 9.4  
6.8 Handling of missing data in the analysis:   
Missing data either incomplete responses (items missing) or absent responses (dropout s or missing 
records) reduce the efficiency of the studies and may introduce biases into the analyses. Little and Rubin 
125 describe a hierarchy of missing data mechanisms including missing completely at random (MCAR), 
missing at random (MAR), and not missing at random (NMAR). When data are MCAR then the records 
even those with missing values can be considered a random sample of the complete data 126. Thus, a 
complete case analyses of only observations that all data elements would give you accurate estimates of 
the target population. General linear models and generalized linear models are valid assessment tools in 
the MCAR case  126, 127. With MAR data, complete case analyses is invalid however, missing data may be 
imputed from the observed data even from records with incomplete responses. Valid inference for MAR 
can only occur in generalized linear models or generalized mixed li near models if the models are 
correctly specified otherwise the inferences will be biased  126, 127.  When data are NMAR, then the 
mechanism for missing data must be included in the model but unfortunately the missing mechanism is 
usually not known so and w ould have to be simulated 126. There is no way to correctly analyze NMAR 
data unless the missing mechanism is included the analytical model.  
For our purposes we will assume that missing data are MAR and use multiple imputation methods such 
as Markov chain  Monte Carlo method which creates a series of plausible values for the missing data 127. 
The data are combined and estimates for inference are made. The benefit of imputation is that a set or 
reasonable values are substituted for the missing one. The cost of imputation is that the error terms for 
estimates such as differences between interventions are increased thereby [CONTACT_502459]. For sensitivity analyses, we plan to compare results from three basic analyses: 1) 
complete cas e analyses (assumes MCAR is true), 2) multiple imputation by [CONTACT_502460], 
and 3) multiple imputation by [CONTACT_502461] a monotonic missing patterns in the data so that different 
imputation models may be tried to see how study results vary un der different imputation models 125. If 
after close inspection of the data, the research team suspects that a NMAR mechanism may be at work,

testing by [CONTACT_502462], the 
false discovery rate, using Benjamini and Hoc hberg’s linear step -up method 128.

for international markets. The Sponsor will refer to Emergent BioSolutions Canada Inc. throughout this protocol.  
The Sponsor is developi[INVESTIGATOR_534773]- Influenza Immunoglobulin Intravenous (FLU- IGIV) 
human product for the treatment of serious influenza infection in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9643]. The 
FLU -IGIV product will be manufactured using the same hyperimmune manufactu ring 
platform process as the FDA and Health Canada licensed products: CNJ -016
® [Vaccinia 
Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human), VIGIV], ANTHRASIL® [Anthrax Immune 
Globulin Intravenous (Human), AIGIV], WinRho® SDF [Rho(D) Immune Globulin 
Intravenous (Human)], HepaGam B® [Hepatitis B Immune Globulin (Human) Injection], and 
VARIZIG® [Varicella Zoster Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human)]†. 
Proprietary Name: [CONTACT_534870] (TBD)  
Proper / Common Name: [CONTACT_74939]- Influenza Immunog lobulin Intravenous (Human) 
Abbreviated Name: [CONTACT_175085] -IGIV  
Code Name: [INVESTIGATOR_680] -025 
Anti-Influenza Immunog lobulin Intravenous will be formulated in multiple  single -use vial(s) 
as a ster ile liquid stabilized with 10% maltose and 0.03% polysorbate 80 (pH between 5.0 
and 6.5) and free of any preservatives. 
Anti-Influenza Immunoglobulin is produced from source plasma collected from Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) licensed plasma collection establishments in the [LOCATION_002] 
(US) and Health Canada/US FDA licensed plasma collection establishments in Canada from 
healthy donors who have recovered from influenza (convalescent) and/or were vaccinated 
against seasonal influenza strains. The plasma contains a relatively high concentration of antibodies directed against seasonal influenza strains, specifically influenza A strains H1N1 
and H3N2. Influenza antibodies have been correlated with vaccine efficacy and the passive

 transfer of anti -influenza antibodies are effective in animal models of severe influenza ( 2), 
(4), (5), (6). Clinical proof of concept from treatment with convalescent plasma and purified 
intravenous immunoglobulin (IGIV) suggest that FLU- IGIV can raise antibodies levels and 
impact the course of serious illne ss caused by [CONTACT_14302] A  (7), (8), (9).  
FLU -IGIV is a purified immun oglobulin preparation containing antibodies to seasonal 
influenza A virus strains. It is a glycoprotein of 150–160 kilodaltons. 
FLU -IGIV will be used in conjunction with SOC, including supportive measures, ventilator 
and fluid management and the prevention and treatment of secondary bacterial pneumonia, 
which will be captured in the case report form (CRF). Based on current CDC guidance on 
Treatment Considerations for Patients Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_191546] S uspected or Confirmed influenza  
(or equivalent) ( 1), (2) it is recommended that SOC include a minimum 5 day course of 
oseltamivir (75  mg/twice a day). All antiviral treatments post-symptom development and 
during the study will be recorded in the C RF. 
Immun oglobulin G molecules are glycoproteins composed of one or more units, each 
containing four polypeptide chains: two identical heavy chains (H) and two identical light chains (L). The amino terminal ends of each polypeptide show considerable variation in 
amino acid composition and are referred to as the variable (V) regions to distinguish them from the relatively constant (C) regions. The L chain consists of one variable domain V
L and 
one constant domain C L. The H chain consists of a variable domain V H, and three constant 
domains (CH 1, CH 2, and CH 3). The number of amino acids, along with the molecular weight 
of each heavy chain is approximately twice that of each light chain.  
Influenza therapi[INVESTIGATOR_534774]. Currently, seasonal influenza vaccines against circulating viral strains are available for active immunization to influenza A and B. In addition, antiviral therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], including neuraminidase inhibitors, can 
prevent and treat acute uncomplicated influenza by  [CONTACT_534828]. Yet seasonal 
influenza remains a significant annual disease burden in the [LOCATION_002] and worldwide. 
The current vaccines and therapeutics have not proven to be adequate to prevent serious 
influenza illness, including the significant number of annual medical visits, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_534775] ( 10). While vaccination reduces influenza incidence and 
severity, vaccine effectiveness is dependent on vaccine coverage, individual response rates 
and the match between the vaccine and circulating influenza strains. While neuraminidase 
inhibitors are potent at inhibiting virus replication, they have limited effectiveness when used beyond [ADDRESS_694518] emerged ( 11). Currently 
there are no approved therapi[INVESTIGATOR_534776], creating an unmet need to treat and improve outcomes in this population. The use of convalescent plasma and fractionated immun oglobulins has been suggested as a complementary strategy to 
treat influ enza virus infection, modify the outcomes of severe disease and provide additional 
benefit to the standard of care ( 12), (13 ). 
The safety profile for immun oglobulin products is well-established in the clinic. 
Immun oglobulins are normal constituents of the human body fluid, and they are used at 
physiological levels without creating pharmacologic/toxicologic active metabolites ( 14). The 
Protocol Number IA -[ADDRESS_694519] effective when used within 48 hours of symptoms ( 15), 
however, they are not approved for use in this indication. The Sponsor is developi[INVESTIGATOR_534777]-IGIV ; an anti -influenza immun oglobulin product from high titer plasma to treat serious 
illness caused by [CONTACT_14302] A in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9643].  
The safety profile for im munoglobulin products is well-established in the clinic. 
Immunoglobulins are normal constituents of the human body fluid, and they are used at 
physiological levels without creating pharmacologic/toxicologic active metabolites ( 14). 
Furthermore, The Sponsor has a long history of developi[INVESTIGATOR_534778] -based therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], 
including the licensed products outlined above. Like other human immunoglobul ins, The 
Sponsor’s hyperimmune products have been studied in several healthy volunteer and patient 
trials; the safety profile is consistent with other immunoglobulin products and the pharmacokinetic profile is similar for each product with a half -life of a pproximately [ADDRESS_694520] enrolment into a Phase I study. Furthermore, determining the anti -influenza titer s and pharmacokinetic profile in severe patients is expected to be more 
informative and may be predictive of patient outcomes rather than a Phase I study in healthy volunteers. In addition, The Sponsor is currently manufacturing an anti -influenza 
hyperimmu ne for the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) using 
the same standardized and validated hyperimmune manufacturing process and product formulation. The NIAID anti-influenza hyperimmune has been evaluated in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_534779] a Phase 3 trial in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_534780] ( 16, 17, 18).  While a Phase 1 safety and pharmacokinetic trial in healthy volunteers 
is not planned for FLU-IGIV, the doses planned for FLU- IGIV are bracketed by [CONTACT_534829] (VA-
003b, AX-001) , and are expected to have a similar safety and pharmacokinetic profile.  
The Sponsor’s clinical development plan consists of a Phase 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo -controlled dose ranging study evaluating the safety, pharmacokinetics and clinical 
bene fit of FLU -IGIV in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_534781] A 
infection. The primary objective of this study, which initiated in the 2017–2018 flu season, is to determine the optimal dose of FLU-IGIV based upon safety and pharmacokine tics in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_534782] -confirmed influenza A 
infection. The secondary objective is to evaluate the clinical benefit of FLU- IGIV in the 
same population, and to examine exploratory efficacy endpoints to be used in further development.

 A second study, a Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled study evaluating the 
efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of FLU -IGIV in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_534783] A infecti on is also planned. The primary objective of this study, which will be 
initiated following completion of the Phase 2 study, will be  to evaluate the efficacy and 
clinical benefit of FLU -IGIV use in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_534784]-confirmed influenza A inf ection.  
In the clinical trials, the eligible serious hospi[INVESTIGATOR_534785] -patient 
or intensive care unit status and the severity of illness using the National Early Warning 
(NEW) score  (19), as discussed further in section 6.7.9 Nat ional Early Warning (NEW) 
Score below. The NEW score will capture key symptoms and signs of respi[INVESTIGATOR_534786], requirement for supplemental oxygen, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], as well as body temperature, blood pressure, and level of consciousness. The serious

2 TRIAL OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE  
2.1 Hypothesis 
This protocol will allow for the safe use of FLU- IGIV in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_534789] b y laboratory-confirmed influenza A infection.  
2.2 Primary Objective  
The primary objective is to determine the optimal dose of FLU -IGIV based upon evaluation 
of safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_534790]-confirmed influenza A infection. 2.[ADDRESS_694521] of Care (SOC) including antivira l treatment (see 
section 4.1.1).

Version 5.0 2019 -Jan-24 
 
 
Emergent BioSolutions Canada Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 26 of 62 
 3.2 Anticipated Centers  
This is a multi- center trial utilizing up to 60 clinical trial sites  globally. 
3.3 Sample Size  
The sample size will be 75 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_534782] -
confirmed influenza A infection. While no formal sample size calculation was performed, 75 
patients are adequate for determination of optimal dose based on AE and PK da ta, with 
consideration of other safety data and clinical benefit data.  Sample size was not inflated to 
compensate for losses to follow-up.  
3.4 Randomization 
Patients will be randomized 1:1:1 into the study in a double-blind fashion to receive (in 
addition to antiviral SOC)  either a low dose (5 vials) FLU-IGIV or high dose (10 vials) FLU-
IGIV or placebo. 
Randomization schedule generation and logistics will be handled by a DM vendor. A dummy 
randomization schedule will be created by [CONTACT_534830] e Sponsor. 
Subsequently, the production unblinded randomization schedule, differing only in random number-generating seed value, will be generated by [CONTACT_534831]. The randomization schedule will be stored electronically by [CONTACT_534832] a protected server inaccessible to blinded study team members.  
Randomization will not be stratified, except by [CONTACT_3725].  
3.[ADDRESS_694522] of the study will remain 
blinded through database lock. There will be blinding covers for the IV bags as described in section 5.4 Preparation . 
EDC data will be blinded using role-based permissions. Randomization group and study medication dispensing data will be integrated with the clinical database prior to database lock, but unblinding data will be removed from blinded data extracts by [CONTACT_534833]. Study medication dosing data will be 
reconciled with the randomized treatment group for each patient by [CONTACT_406882], and any deviations will be reported in the C linical S tudy R eport. The trial will be unblinded 
once the clinical database is locked.  
While this is a double-blind trial, the blind may be broken if a patient’s health or safety is at risk and knowledge of the study arm may be beneficial to the medical management of the 
patient. In the event that unblinding is required, the IXRS will be contact[CONTACT_534834]’s treatment group allocation to the 
Protocol Number IA -[ADDRESS_694523] (DSMB) will provide another layer of patient safety 
assurance. The DSMB conduct ed a data review meeting following enrollment and data entry 
for the first  [ADDRESS_694524] demographics, medical history, study medication (FLU-IGIV or placebo) dosing, AEs and SAEs. The DSMB may make a nonbinding 
recommendati on that The Sponsor stop the study based on pre-specified stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_534791] (Further details will be outlined in the  
DSMB Charter).

6.3 Randomization 
Randomization occurs as soon as possible (within 48 hours) after screening and Day 1 
Baseline Pre-Infusion assessments are complete. Randomization should be performed as 
close as possible to the time of infusion. Study treatment administration w as staggered by 3 
days (72 hours) between patients for the first 9 patients.  
6.4 Study Treatment Administration (Day 1) 
The study treatment is to be administered  for the first [ADDRESS_694537] supervision 
of the investigator or a qualified sub-investigator or designate. Under no circumstances will 
the investigator allow FLU -IGIV  to be used other than as specified in the protocol. For full 
details on FLU-IGIV preparation, storage, and administration refer to the Investigator ’s 
Brochure.  
Patients will be assigned into one of the three arms based on their randomization to study 
treatment  as follows: 
Arm 1: 5 vials ( 225 mL diluted to 500 mL with saline ) FLU -IGIV;  
Arm 2: 10 vials (450 mL diluted to 500 mL with saline ) FLU -IGIV; or  
Arm 3: Placebo: 500 mL normal saline. 
Taking into consideration the maximum protein concentration (refer to IB),  the high dose 
group would receive a maximum IgG protein dose of 31.5 g.  Assuming a patient weight range of 60 kg to 100 kg, patients will receive approximately 0.32 – 0.53 g/kg of IgG protein 
for the high dose and approximately 0.16 – 0.26 g/kg for the low dose, in a single infusion. 
For participants in all three assigned treatment groups, the randomized treatment will be administered in addition to SOC as defined above in section 4.1.[ADDRESS_694538] of Care 
(SOC). Eligible patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive either a low dose (5 
vials) FLU -IGIV or high dose (10 vials) FLU-IGIV or placebo. 
Both FLU -IGIV doses must be diluted with saline solution to a final volume of [ADDRESS_694539] be covered with a sleeve to maintain blinding .  
FLU -IGIV  and placebo will be administered by [CONTACT_534840]: 
• Starting infusion rate of 1.0 mL/min for first 30 minutes .  
• Incremental infusion rate if tolerated (every 15-30 minutes) of 1.0 mL/min .  
Protocol Number IA -001 
Version 5.0 2019 -Jan-24 
 
 
Emergent BioSolutions Canada Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 35 of 62 
 • Maximum Infusion Rate of 4.0 mL/min.  
• The duration of infusion for 500 mL will be approximately 3 hours.  
A lower maximum infusion rate of 2 mL/min should be used for patients with increased risk 
of acute renal dysfunction or thrombotic events, based on investigator’s medical opi[INVESTIGATOR_534801]. If there is a tolerance issue during infusion, the rate can be scaled back.  
If adverse events occur, such as flushing, headache, nausea, changes in pulse rate or bl ood 
pressure, the rate of infusion should be slowed or temporarily stopped. When events resolve, the infusion rate may be resumed at a rate that is comfortable to the subject (start at half of 
the last tolerated rate and increase gradually).  Refer to the I B (section 3.4.3 Administration) 
for more information.  
6.5 Day 1 ( Post-Infusion  of Study Treatment ) 
After administration of the study treatment , the following assessments must occur (within 4 
hours from when the infusion is complete).  
• Vital signs (including flu symptoms).  
• Adverse events  (AEs) & unanticipated problems.  
• Concomitant medications.  
• NEW score assessment.  
• Central lab  
• Post- infusion PK sample collection: within 90 minutes after completion of study 
treatment infusion , serum sample (two 2 mL transport tubes per time point) will be 
collected for HAI and MN  analysis .  
6.6 Additional Assessments  
Patients will be followed through Day 60 after randomization. Study visits and related 
procedures are to be done at the same point in time in which the study treatment infusion was

terminal elimination rate constant.  
• AUC 0-t/AUC 0-inf: Ratio of AUC 0-t to AUC 0-inf. 
• Cmax: Maximum observed concentration. 
• Tmax: Sampling time at which C max occurs. Where the maximum value occurs at more 
than one time point, T max will be the first time point with this value.  
• Kel: Apparent first order terminal elimination rate constant calculated by [CONTACT_534842] n analysis using the maximum number of points in the terminal log -linear 
phase.  
• t½: Apparent first order terminal elimination half -life.

 from subjects’ natural immunity, PK parameters will be estimates only and cannot quantify 
precisely the levels of FLU -IGIV in dosed subjects.  
8 ASSESSMENT OF  SAFETY  
The safety of the trial drug will be assessed by [CONTACT_534843] a dverse events  (AE) 
defined as  related to study treatment, lab results for chemistry and hematology and 
concomitant medications co llected throughout the study. Any lab results and concomitant 
medications will be monitored regularly.  
8.1 Adverse Event/Serious Adverse Event Definition  
The occurrence of AE s will be monitored throughout all phases of the trial and will cover all 
participating subjects. AE capture will begin after randomization, and any medical history changes that occur after baseline assessments during randomization  and before dosing should 
be updated as medical history. 
Adverse events are to be elicited by [CONTACT_093] (or designate) by [CONTACT_297261]-
leading questions.  The association of the AE to the study treatment is to be judged by [CONTACT_534844]-related/no relationship. 
8.1.1 Definitions  
An Adverse Event (AE)
:  Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not 
necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An adverse event (AE) can therefore b e any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product. 
NOTE: A  diagnosis should be preferentially captured as an adverse event term and 
signs and symptoms should be captured only in the absence of a unifying diagnosis.  In the event that there are multiple diagnoses, then all diagnoses should be captured.  
The worsening of an existing sign, symptom or disease is also considered to be an 
AE.  An abnormal laboratory finding deemed by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_496061], but an abnormal laboratory 
finding that worsens after dosing with the study drug, from not clinically significant 
to clinically significant, is considered an AE.  Surgical procedures are not AE s.  They 
are the action taken to treat a medical condition.  Interventions that were planned 
prior to study entry for medical conditions that started prior to study entry, but did 
not worsen during the clinical trial are not reported as AEs. 
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE)
:  Any untoward medical occurrence that at any 
dose: results in death, is life threatening, requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8448], results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
Protocol Number IA -[ADDRESS_694560] and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. 
NOTE: Death  is an outcome and not an event. The condition leading to death is the 
event. Death will be considered an event only when no other information regarding 
the cause of death is available. 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_534809] a SAE.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_534810] a trial for social reasons (e.g., transportation difficulties, respi[INVESTIGATOR_4594]) 
is not considered to be a SAE. 
Adverse Drug Reaction
:  Any noxious and unintended response to a medicinal 
product related to any dose. 
Expected Adverse Drug Reaction/Event :  An adverse reaction, the nature or 
severity of which is consistent with the applicable product information (e.g. 
Investigator’s Brochure for an unapproved investigational product or package 
insert/summary of product characteristics for an approved product). 
Unexpected Adverse Drug Reaction/Event :  An adverse reaction, the nature or 
severity of which is not consistent with the applicable product information (e.g. Investigator’s Brochure for an unapproved investigational product or package insert/summary of product characteristics for an approved product). 
All adverse events, including those that are not of a serious nature and those that are expected, w ill be documented by [CONTACT_473] (or designates) in the source 
documents and appropriately transcribed into the CRF.  All adverse events will be 
examined by a physician investigator or sub-investigator for assessment of both 
severity and causality us ing the following criteria:  
8.1.2 Assessment of Severity (Intensity)  
The adverse event severity should be assessed based on the MedDRA Lowest Level Term (LLT) scale below.  
Mild
: awareness of a sign or symptom but subject can tolerate.  
Moderate : discomfort enough to cause interference with normal daily activity.  
Severe : resulting in an inability to do work or do usual daily activity. 
8.1.3 Assessment of Causality (ICH Classification) 
In accordance with ICH E2A and 21.CFR.312, the following definitions are used to assess causality (relatedness) of the adverse events:  
Protocol Number IA -001 
Version 5.0 2019 -Jan-24 
 
 
Emergent BioSolutions Canada Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 47 of 62 
 Related :  There is a reasonable possibility that the AE was caused by [CONTACT_534845]. The expression “reasonable possibility” is meant to convey in general that 
there are facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship.  
Not-related / No relationship :  The AE is clearly or most probably caused by [CONTACT_534846]’s underlying condition, therapeutic intervention or concomitant therapy, or the delay between the administration of the product and the 
onset of the AE is incompatible with a causal relation, or the AE started before the administration of the product. 
8.2 Description of Known AE Profile for FLU -IGIV  
The safety of human IV immunoglobulins is well establishe d.  The incidence of AEs 
associated with administration of IV immunoglobulin  products is reported by [CONTACT_534847] 1 to 15%, usually less than 5% ( 20, 21 ).  Non -
anaphylactic reactions are most common and the majority of AEs are mild and self -limiting 
in nature. 
A compl ete list of risks with details ar e outlined in the Investigator ’s Brochure which  
includes: 
• Hypersensitivity  
• Renal dysfunction/f ailure  
• Aseptic Meningitis Syndrome (AMS)  
• Hemolysis  
• Thrombotic events 
• Transfusion- Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI)  
• Infusion rate reactions  
• Interference with blood glucose testing

• Any other findings that, at the discretion of the medical monitors, indicate that the study should be halted. 
Administrative issues affecting one or more sites may constitute grounds for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_534814](s). Examples include, but are not limited to, non -adherence to the protocol, 
unavailability of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_534815] ’s (or their authorized 
representative) monitoring personnel, inadequate evidence of the Pri ncipal Investigator’s 
personal conduct or supervision of the trial, relocation of the investigator or reallocation of 
investigator’s responsibilities or disqualification of the investigator by [CONTACT_128920]. 
The Sponsor and the site principal in vestigator (s) may elect to terminate the trial early for a 
variety of other reasons. A decision to terminate the trial early may be based on data 
suggesting that the trial treatment (or participation in the trial) may be unsafe; the protocol or conduct of the trial is flawed such that the safety or rights of the trial subjects may be 
adversely affected; the ethics committee withdraws the approval for the trial and denies 
reconsideration; the investigational treatment is found to be ineffective; recruitment is poor; research strategy or management priorities change; or a clinical hold is imposed by a regulatory authority, to name a few.  
Any decision to voluntarily suspend or terminate a clinical trial will be carefully reviewed and fully justified. The Sponsor will notify the regulatory authorities and the Institutional 
Review Board s (IRB)/Ethics Committee s (EC) of any suspension or termination, along with 
justification for restarting or terminating the study as applicable.  
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_534816] /EC in writing of the trial’s completion or early 
termination. The Sponsor must receive a copy of the notification letter from the IRB /EC 
indicating receipt of the completion or early termination letter.

 AEs will be coded to system organ class and preferred term using the Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) , using the current version at the time of coding . AEs will 
be defined as events beginning after first study medication administration that were not 
present prior to first  study medication administration or those that were present prior to first 
study medication administration and subsequently worsened in severity. AE incidence for 
each system organ class and preferred term will be summarized for the safety population by 
[CONTACT_534852] (FLU -IGIV or placebo). Serious AEs will be summarized separately for the same 
population, as will deaths.  Separate subgroup analyses of AE and SAE incidence s by [CONTACT_4321], 
race (Caucasians, African Americans, and others) and age (over 55 versus 18-54) will be 
performed by [CONTACT_1570]. 
PK analysis for anti -influenza antibodies will be conducted for the PK population using HAI 
and MN  analysis. Serum concentration  versus time data will be analyzed by [CONTACT_534853] (i.e., trapezoidal method). Actual times and not nominal times 
will be used in the analysis, and concentrations below the limit of quantitation (LOQ) and/or 
detection (LOD) will be imp uted as half of this value. Calculated PK parameters will include 
maximum serum concentration (C max), time of maximum serum concentration (t max), half- life 
(t1/2), area under the concentration- time curve (AUC) for 0 -t (time [ADDRESS_694566] 
concentration), AUC 0-7 (time 0 to Day 7), AUC 0-inf (time 0 to infinity), ratio of AUC 0-t/AUC 0-
inf, terminal elimination rate constant (K el), clearance (Cl) and volume of distribution (V ss). 
PK parameters will be reported using descriptive statistics by [CONTACT_534854]. Dose proportionality will be explored using log-transformed PK data. Serum 
concentration -time data will be plotted by [CONTACT_1570]. Relevant subset analyses may be 
performed.  
Patient disposition, including early termination reasons, wi ll be summarized by [CONTACT_534855]. Major protocol deviations will be presented by [CONTACT_281708]. Patient demographics, medical history and study medication (FLU- IGIV 
or placebo) dosing data will be tabulated by [CONTACT_281708]. Important baseline values such as ordinal score assessment, NEW score and flu symptoms will be summarized by [CONTACT_534856] . Pre-infusion 
medications, concomitant medications and concomitant medical procedures will be coded using the WHO Drug Dictionary and displayed by [CONTACT_281708]. 
Ordinal scale assessment will be analyzed at Days [ADDRESS_694567] of treatment group on ordinal 
outcome. An odds ratio will be computed for each study treatment group relative to placebo, interpretable as the mean location shift across the ordinal scale attributed to IVIG treatment. 
After verification of the proportional odds assumption for dose, a dose-response relationship 
will be tested using ordinal logistic regression with a cumulative logit link and an ordinal dose variable, adjusting for significant prognostic factors using stepwise selection. If the 
proportional odds assumption is significantly violated, then a partial proportional odds model 
for dose will be explored. Relevant subset analyses may be performed.

for the ITT and CE populations using nonparametric rank analysis. Viral load data from 
central laboratory NP swabs will be summarized by [CONTACT_534857] (e .g, Days 2 and 3). The relationship between PK and viral load will be 
investigated for patients belonging to both the PK and ITT populations.

be dealt with by [CONTACT_534865] (or designate) to the investigator.  
11.6 Monitoring  
Safety will be monitored using a risk -based monitoring approach. At the time the trial is 
initiated, monitors from The Sponsor/CRO will thoroughly review the protocol and data forms with the investigators and their staff. During the trial, the monitors will be available to 
discuss by [CONTACT_756], e-mail, or in person (during site visits), questions regarding adverse 
reactions, removal of subjects from the trial, conduct of the trial and other clinical trial 
matters. Monitors from The Sponsor /CRO will visit at the initiation of the trial, during the 
trial and at the completion of the trial. At the time of each monitoring visit, the monitors will check the case report forms of the subjects to ensure that all items have been completed, that the data are accurate and obtained in the manner specified in the protocol and that data 
recorded on the data forms for the trial agree wit h medical records at the site. The monitors 
will also check for general protocol and regulatory compliance by [CONTACT_534866].

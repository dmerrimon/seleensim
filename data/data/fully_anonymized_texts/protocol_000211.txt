3 Years (12/01/2019 – 11/30/2022) 
5. LAY LANGUAGE SUMMARY OR SYNOPSIS (no more than one paragraph)  
We will develop and pi[INVESTIGATOR_21087] a culturally tailored, trauma -informed smartphone  app, called LinkPositively , for 
Black WLHA affected by [CONTACT_688510]. Core components of  LinkPositively include: a) Virtual Peer 
Navigation that includes phone and text check -ins and 4 weekly one -on-one video sessions to build skills to 
cope with barriers and navigate care; b) Social Networking platform to  receive peer support; c) Educational 
and Self -care database with healthy living and self -care tips; d) GPS -enabled  Resource Locator for HIV care 
and ancillary support service agencies; and e) ART  self-monitoring and  reminder system. Guided by [CONTACT_688511], the study will be  conducted in 2 phases with 
corresponding aims. In Phase 1 ( Aim 1), [ADDRESS_933925] likely to support  downloading, 
initiating use, and sustaining engagement over time. Aim 1 will culminate in usability testing by  [CONTACT_688512] (n= 8), to finalize intervention components and procedures. In  Phase 2 ( Aim 
2), we will pi[INVESTIGATOR_688474] (i.e., retention in care, ART adherence, viral suppression) and  
mechanism of change variables (i.e., social support, self -efficacy). Through a randomized control trial (RCT), 
participants will be randomly assigned to  either the intervention  arm (n=40) or control  arm (Ryan White 
standard of care, n=40) , with follow -up at 3 - and 6 - months. This study will benefit the advancement of HIV 
prevention sci ence by [CONTACT_688513], while improving social 
support through peers and social networking –all under the auspi[INVESTIGATOR_688475] -informed for Black WLHA 
with experiences of interpersonal violence . 
6. SPECIFIC AIMS  
 
Aim 1: Develop the LinkPositively mobile intervention through focus groups (FGs) with Black WLHA  
affected by [CONTACT_688510], peer navigators, and service providers, and refine iterations 
through  input from the San Diego CFAR Disparities Core CAB.  
Four FGs, with 6-8 HIV -positive Black WLHA reporting  a lifetime history of interpersonal violence by [CONTACT_688514] (n=2 FGs) and non -intimate partner (n=2 FGs);  one FG with 4 -6 Peer Navigators 
employed at HIV clinics/service agencies; and 4 -6 key informant interviews  with service providers will be 
conducted in San Diego, CA. Group differences will be explored to optimize  LinkPositively across 
different types of reported perpetrators. The outcomes will be feedback on proposed  intervention 
components and suggestions f or new features, as well as recommendations for how to address  
challenges to engagement with LinkPositively. Aim 1 will culminate in usability testing by [CONTACT_688515] (n= 8), to finalize intervention components and procedures.  
 
Aim 2: Conduct a pi[INVESTIGATOR_688476], acceptability and 
preliminary  
impact of the LinkPositively intervention for Black WLHA affected by [CONTACT_688510], in  
preparation for a large -scale R01.  
Eighty Black WLHA ever experiencing interpersonal violence will be  randomly assigned (1:1) to receive 
LinkPositively or standard of care Ryan White services, with self -reported,  biological, and clinical 
outcomes collected at baseline, 3 - and 6 -month follow -up visits. Intervention use data will  be collected 
throughout the intervention period to examine feasibility, acceptability, and the associations between  
components used and study outcomes. Primary outcomes are retention in HIV care, ART adherence, 
and vi ral suppression, whereas socio -structural mechanism of change variables are social support and 
 
 
Biomedical IRB Application Instructions  
Page 4 activation of social  support networks, self -efficacy, and utilization of ancillary support services.  To 
minimize recall bias and/or social desirability bias, that may occur with the use of audio computer -
assisted self -interviews, we will use objective data to measure the main outcomes. Retention in HIV 
care and viral suppression will be based on medical r ecord data and ART adherence will be measured 
using hair samples assayed for tenofovir and emtricitabine.  The proposed study will benefit the 
advancement o f HIV prevention science by [CONTACT_688516] -occurring 
adverse mental health and substance abuse – an underserved, marginalized population. If the  
LinkPositively intervention is efficacious through an eventual R01 mechanism, it will change the 
paradigm for  addressing the unique HIV treatment needs for Black women dually affected by [CONTACT_688517] . 
 
7. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
 
Background and Significance  
Black women are  disproportionately affected by [CONTACT_688518]. Black women living  with 
HIV/AIDS (WLHA) in the US are less likely to be engaged in HIV care and adherent to antiretrovi ral therapy 
(ART) compared to o ther racial/ethnic groups  (1-3). Black WLHA account for 61% of diagnoses among women  
of all races and ethnicities  (4), only 56% are retained in care  (1), and 49% virally suppressed  (1). Black WLHA 
are particularly affected in San Diego County, CA, with HIV prevalence rates 8 times higher than that  observed 
for White WLHA  (5) and are underserved and understudied. Blacks on ART in San Diego are less likely to be 
virally  suppressed than Latinos or Whites  (6). Concurrently, Black women are disproportionately affected by  
[CONTACT_688510], defined as ever experiencing physical (e.g., hit, slapped, choked), sexual (e.g., forced  
vaginal/anal sex), and/or psychological (e.g., yelled at, belittled, controlling behaviors) abuse by a male 
intimate  partner (e.g., spouse, boyfriend, dating partner) or non -intimate partner (e.g., relative, friend, 
stranger).  Interpersonal violence is comprised of commonly reported forms of violence (i.e., intimate partner 
violence (IPV),  rape, contact [CONTACT_688519], childhood abuse). Whereas the national pre valence of lifetime 
IPV is 45%  (7), Black  women report 35% higher IPV than Whit e women  (8). Moreover, although national data 
estimates the lifetime  prevalence of  rape among Black women at 21%  (7), community -based samples estimate 
prevalence rates of rape  as high as 38 -54% (9-12). 
Interpersonal violence and co -occurrence of adverse mental health and substance abuse contribute  
to poor HIV care continuum outcomes.  WLHA experience high rates of lifetime physical, sexual, or  
psychological abuse (67%)  (13), lifetime IPV (55%)  (14-15), and  past year IPV (27%)  (16), a rate double the 
US national  average. A history of abuse or trauma among WLHA is also associated with ART non -adherence, 
lower CD4  counts, reduced viral suppression,  and increased mortality  (14, 17 -20). A recent study found that 
among HIV -positive  women, those who reported recent trauma had over 3 times the odds of antiret roviral 
failure compared to their  counterp arts (17, 21) . WLHA also experience co -occurring syndemic conditions with 
15-24% reporting heavy or  hazardous drinking o f alcohol  (22-23), 11-15% reporting active drug use  (24-25), 
and 30% suffering from post -traumatic  stress disorder (PTSD)  (15). Black women are more likely  to 
experience these conditions (26)  than their White or Latina  counterparts. In the few studies that account for co -
occurring syndemic conditions using a summative score,  higher syndemic scores (i.e., IPV, substance abuse, 
binge drinking, adverse mental health, and sexual risk-taking ) were associated with poor ART adherence 
among HIV-positive men and women  (27), and HIV -positive  youth  (28), and reduced viral suppression among 
HIV-positive women of color  (29).  
 
Socio -structural barriers contribute to poor HIV care outcomes, whereas social support mitigates  the 
effect.  In addition to interpersonal violence and co -morbid adverse mental health and substance abuse,  
Black WLHA also face socio -structural barriers affecting retention in care and ART adherence, such as HIV -
related  stigma and medical mistrust  (30). HIV stigma is the most noted barrier to consistent access to and 
utilization  of HIV care services for Black wome n (30-31). Experiences of racism, conspi[INVESTIGATOR_235423], and the 
quality of  relationships impact engagement in HIV medical care  (32). Race -based medi cal mistrust predicts 
 
 
Biomedical IRB Application Instructions  
Page 5 lower ART adherence  among Black WLHA  (33). However, social support through formal and informal 
networks may be important to address these complex issues, and has improved engagement in HIV care 
among Black WLHA  (34-37). Specifically, women with abuse histories are more likely to seek formal help at 
service agencies, after seeking  support and encouragement from informal social networks  (38). Studies 
collectively suggest that socio -structural  factors, including lack of social support and HIV -related stigma, n eed 
to be considered by [CONTACT_688520], providers, and the support networks of Black WLHA  (30). 
 
Mobile technology interventions to address HIV prevention are limited among women . Given high  
rates of Internet access and smartphone infiltration across genders and races/ethnicities, mobile health  
(mHealth) technology interventions have emerged as one approach to sup port lifelong engagement in HIV 
care (32,39) . Mobile technology such as mobile phones and other wireless computing devices offers 
advantages for  women with a history of interpersonal violence such as confidentiality, mor e efficient and safer 
care, and empowerment  (40-44). A majority of women (88%) in the US use the internet, with no  differences in 
internet use by r ace/ethnicity (89% of Whites; 87% of  Blacks)  (45). In the US, cellphone ownership is highest 
among Black adults  (98% vs 94% of White adults), and approximately three -quarters of adults across all 
races/ethnicities own a  smartphone. Smartphone use is highly prevalent among Black individuals over all 
(72%)  (46) and those with low socioeconomic statu s (85% -90% for Black women)  (46-47). Moreover, 52% of 
Black women use a smar tphone to access health information at least weekly. However, based on a 2013 
review solely focused on smartphone  applications (apps) for HIV/sexually transmitted disease care and 
prevention,  most smartphone apps failed to create engaging and attractive ap ps (48), provided limited 
psychological and emotional support resources, and miss  important opportunities for intervention (e.g., did not 
include messages about HIV prevention or medication  adherence  (48)). Unfortunately, these limitations to 
realizing the potential impact of mHealth interventions persist.  
 
Peer Navigation has been highlighted as a successful model of care in improving outcomes along the 
HIV care continuum  (49). Peer Navigators are HIV -positive, medication -adherent role models living with a  
similar shared experience and community membership as their target populations. Peer navigators provide 
social  support and positive modeling of engagement -supportive behaviors to their clients, helpi[INVESTIGATOR_688477]’ self -efficacy  in patient -provider communication and increase clients’ trust and confiden ce in the health 
care system;  offsetting the negative impact of socio -structural barriers (i.e., fear of gender -/racial -bias driving 
medical mistrust,  stigma, and discrimination  (50)) on HIV care. Peer Navigators also build clients’ self -efficacy 
for future engagement  in the HIV care system. Peer Navigation for improving retention in care among WLHA 
has been found to be  feasible, acceptable, and efficacious in the US and low - and middle -income countries  
(51-55). Peer navigation has  improved ART adherence an d viral suppression  (55-57), although som e studies 
have found no effect  (58), perhaps due  to small samples or the lack of informal social support. Peer navigation 
with other forms of informal peer support,  would likely provide greater opportunities to reduce social isolation, 
build community, and share strategies for  addressing syndemic and other (e.g., risky sexual behavior) factors 
for Black WLHA. A recent analysis of  messages posted on a closed Facebook group for a young adult HIV 
program showed that mem bers provided  high levels of emotional and social network support.  
 
Preliminary Data  
 
mHealth Interventions. [CONTACT_688569] (mPI ) is currently PI [INVESTIGATOR_688478]. Thrive with Me  (TWM; R01DA039950) is a responsive 
(i.e., adjusts to fit most devices) website that uses: informal peer support (similar to Facebook); tailored ART 
adherence and HIV -related information; self -monitoring of ART adherence, mood and drug use; and 
gamificatio n components to improve ART adherence among HIV -positive adult MSM. Based on encour aging 
results of a pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251] (59) , an efficacy trial  of TWM is underway in which 400 adults  (age ≥18 years) HIV -
positive MSM in [LOCATION_001] City with sub -optimal ART adherence will be randomized to receive TWM for 5 
months or an information -only control, and followed for 17 months. An interim analysis of community wall posts 
found that HIV -positive  MSM spontaneously initiated discussions with each other on sensitive topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102], such as 
ART adherence and sexual risk reduction strategies, and provided informational and emotional support to one 
 
 
Biomedical IRB Application Instructions  
Page 6 other  (60). As part of the UNC/Emory Center for Innovative Technology (iTech), within the new Adolescent 
Trials Network (ATN), TWM is being adapted for and subsequently tested among 350 HIV+ youth (15 -17 
years) and young adults (18 -24 year; U19 HD089881). Also, as p art of ATN’s iTech, the team is leading a 
technology -based stepped care intervention for transgender and gender non -binary youth to reduce sexual 
risk behavior and increase PrEP uptake through tailored SMS messages, a culturally -tailored mobile a pp, and 
individualized e -coaching (U24 HD5109014). Finally, [CONTACT_112541] recently completed a native app (available 
on iOS and Android) intervention to increase regular HIV testing . 
 
Peer Navigation. The BRID GES Project  (PI: [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Stockman; Consultant: [CONTACT_688570]; [LOCATION_004] HIV/AIDS  
Research Program; HD15 -SD-059) is a Peer Navigation RCT intervention among Black and Latina women in  
San Diego, CA that provides trauma -informed Peer Navigation to improve linkage to and retention in HIV care  
and ancillary support services. Upon completion of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_21087], women reported improvements in copi[INVESTIGATOR_52497] -
efficacy,  self-efficacy to activate social support networks, and had increased retention in HIV care over a 3-
month  period  (61). [CONTACT_688571] (Consultant) leads an HIV service organization (WORLD) in Oakland, CA, 
that has implemented peer navigation services into their programs. The Peer Advocate program at WORLD 
hires  Peer Navigators, including Black WLHA – with life experiences similar to the wo men they serve (e.g., 
histories of physical, sexual, and psychological abuse; adverse mental health; substance abuse) – who 
provide emotional  and practical support to WLHA, and help them navigate the medical and social services 
systems. [CONTACT_688572] and WORLD led a peer navigation intervention (Kaiser -funded stud y) to improve 
engagement in HIV care and ART initiation among out -of-care HIV -positive women of color. Of the 84 women 
enrolled  (62), 48% experienced lifetime physical abuse, 42% experienced lifetime sexual assault, 29% used 
substances in the past month, and 29% had attempted suicide. At 6 -month follow -up, women in the 
intervention group had less missed  HIV care visits and more access to ancillary services than women in the 
control group ( Ryan White case management services). In both groups, there were increases in the proportion 
of women initiating ART. These  findings demonstrate  the utility of a peer-based navigation pro gram in 
improving retention in HIV care and ART uptake.

9. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS  
 
Study Overview:  This study will be conducted in 2 phases , corresponding to the study aims : 
 
Phase 1 (Aim  1): Developi[INVESTIGATOR_688479] a  lifetime history of interpersonal 
violence, peer  navigators, and providers, and the San Diego Center  for AIDS Research (CFAR) Disparities 
Core  Community Advisory Board (CAB) . Phase 1 will culminate in usability testing , Beta Testing,  by [CONTACT_688521] (n=8), to finalize intervention components and procedures.  
 
Phase 2 (Aim  2): Pi[INVESTIGATOR_688480], acceptability, and the  preliminary effect of 
LinkPositively among Black WLHA  with a lifetime history of interpersonal violence. This  multi -component, 
culturally tailored, and trauma -informed  mHealth intervention will primarily aim to  increase retention in HIV 
care, ART adherence, and viral suppression for Black WLHA affected by [CONTACT_688522]. The four 
components of LinkPositively will achieve these aims directly by [CONTACT_208951] -efficacy fo r copi[INVESTIGATOR_007], social 
support networks, and utilization of ancillary support services (i.e., domestic violence, mental  health, 
substance abuse), and indirectly by [CONTACT_688523] . 
  
Study Setting:  The study will take place in three [LOCATION_004] counties (San Diego, Los Angeles, and Alameda)  
and two Oklahoma counties (Oklahoma and Tulsa) . In San Diego County, between 1981 and 2011, the 
proportion of AIDS cases among White  person s dropped (70% to 42%) while the proportion of cases among 
people of color increased considerably (19% to 58%) .While African American  persons  represent 5% of the 
county’s population, they make up 13% of individuals diagnosed with HIV. Moreover , the AIDS rate is almost 8 
higher a mong African American women,  compared to White women. Similar HIV prevalence rates are

Page 7 observed for African American women in other counties in [LOCATION_004] ( Los Angeles and Alameda ) and 
Oklahoma (Oklahoma City and Tulsa) , with African American women disproportionately affected.  
 
Study Population:   
 
AIM 1  
 
In Phase 1 (Aim 1), eligible participants for the focus groups and interviews will be: (1) Black WLHA  (including 
transgender women)  with a history of interpersonal violence (n=6 -8 per FG; total of 4 FGs) ; (2) Black WLHA  
(including transgender women)  with a history of interpersonal violence who act in a professional capacity as a 
Peer Navigator  (n=4-6; one FG) ; and (3) Key Informants (n=4 -6) will be leadership at local clinics and 
community -based organizations known to provide services to women in the areas of HIV/AIDS care and 
domestic violence services , such as UCSD Owen Clinic and Mental Health America.  Phase 1 will culminate in 
usability testing , Beta Testing, by [CONTACT_688524] (n=8 ; 4 with histories of 
interpersonal violence perpetrated by a current or former intimate partner and 4 with histories of interpersonal 
violence perpetrated by a non -intimate  partner [e.g., family member, friend, stranger]) , to finalize intervention 
components and procedures.    
 
AIM 2  
 
In Phase 2 (Aim 2), eligible participants  for the RCT will self -report: (a) female gender  (including transgender 
women) , (b) Black or African American racial/ethnic background, (c) age d 18 years  or older , (d) HIV -positive 
status, (e) ever experienced physical, sexual, and/or psy chological abuse by a current or former partner or 
non-partner (e.g., relative, friend, stranger), (f) owner of a smartphone with internet browsing  capabilities, and 
(g) English speaking. Purposive sampling will be used to ensure tha t groups are balanced  with respect to type 
of perpetrator (current or former intimate partners [e.g., spouse, boyfriend, dating, casual]  and non - intimate 
partners [e.g., family member, friend, stranger]) and retention in HIV medical care status  (linked to care but 
have fallen out of care [i.e., no ART prescription filled, no viral load labs, or no HIV care  visits with an ART -
prescribing provider in the past year] versus linked to and retained in care [i.e., ART  prescription filled, viral 
load labs, or HIV care visits with an ART prescribing provider in the past year]).  
 
Study S creening and Enrollment :  
 
AIM 1  
 
In Phase 1 (Aim 1), three separate recruitment strategies will be imposed based on the distinct types of focus 
groups , key informant interviews , and beta testing.  
• Black WLHA with a history of interpersonal violence (n=6 -8 per FG; total of 4 FGs  and n=8 Beta 
Testing ) will be recruited from organizations in San Diego, CA that provide HIV testing and/or treatment 
to WLHA, all of which are represented through membership in the San Diego CFAR Disparities Core 
CAB. We will also recruit Black WLHA through presentations at organizations providing HIV -related 
services such as Mental Health America San Diego and the Center for Community Solutions Rape 
Crisis Center. Finally, w e will distribute flyers and advertisements through street outreach efforts, 
community events, and newspapers such as the Voice and Viewpoint, an African American local 
newspaper. We have successfully utilized these recruitment efforts in previous studies.  Interested 
women be screened over the phone. They will provide verbal consent to be screened, then asked 
questions regarding eligibility, demographics, and computer literacy.  
• Peer Navigators (n=4 -6; one FG) will be identified by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Stockman’s contact [CONTACT_688525] (e.g., 
UCSD Mother, Child and Adolescent HIV Program and San Ysidro  Health Center). Invitations will be 
extended to each organization with a flyer to be provided to PNs.  
• Key Informants (n=4 -6) will be identified by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Stockman’s in -person or phone contact [CONTACT_688526] -based organizations known to provide services to women in the areas of 
 
 
Biomedical IRB Application Instructions  
Page 8 HIV/AIDS care and domestic violence services such as UCSD Owen Clinic and Mental Health 
America. Print and electronic promotional materials will include a brief description of the study and the 
study phone number to call for more information about the stud y. 
 
For all focus groups , interviews,  and beta testing,  participants will be asked to provide [CONTACT_688573] and [CONTACT_688574] with contact [CONTACT_3031]. Focus group and interviews will be scheduled for dates and time convenient 
for the participants. All participants will review informed consent documentation and p rovide informed consent 
prior to commencement of the focus group s or interview s. 
 
AIM 2 
 
In Phase 2 (Aim 2), we will conduct the pi[INVESTIGATOR_32876] [ADDRESS_933926] established 
relationships with the following key organizations that provide HIV testing and/or treatment to WLHA and these 
organizations are represented through membership in the San Diego CFAR Disparities Core CAB: UC SD 
Owen Clinic, UCSD Mother, Child and Adolescent HIV Program, Family Health Centers of San Diego, San 
Ysidro Health Center. We will also extend recruitment to Black WLHA through presentations at organizations 
providing HIV -related services such as Mental Health America San Diego , Neighborhood House Association,  
and the Center for Community Solutions Rape Crisis Center.  In Los Angeles County, we will recruit from the 
following community -based organizations: UCLA Family AIDS Network, AIDS Project Los Angeles, Maternal 
Child Adolescent Clinic, OASIS Clinic, East LA Women’s Center, Alta Med, and JWCH Institute . In Alameda 
County, we will recruit from WORLD, an HIV service organization for women of color. In Oklahoma City and 
Tulsa Counties, we will recruit from Guiding Right, Inc., a Black -focused community -based organization. In all 
counties, we will distribute flyers and advertisements through st reet outreach efforts, community events, and 
newspapers such as the Voice and Viewpoint, an African American locally based newspaper.  Finally, we will 
employ Facebook Advertising to recruit women through social media, including on the platforms Facebook and 
Instagram, and using the Facebook Audience Network to run advertisements on other websites the target 
population is likely to utiliz e. We have successfully utilized these recruitment efforts in previous studies.  
Further, we will employ Build Clinical, an  organization that assists academic researchers in study enrollment 
through technology and novel data -driven approaches . 
 
Depending on the recruitment source , the following  initial contact [CONTACT_688527]: (1) Women may 
see the study advertisements in the community . Women i nterested in participating in the study will contact [CONTACT_688528].  At the 
time of the initial contact, women will be provided information regarding LinkPositively . Women will then 
express whether or not they are interested in the study. (2) Women may be recr uited via service agencies or 
enrolled participants. By [CONTACT_688529], interested women may request that their contact 
[CONTACT_688530]. At the time of the initial contact, 
women will be provided information regarding LinkPositively . Women will then express whether or not they are 
interested in the study.  (3) Women  may see the study advertisement on social media. By [CONTACT_688531] 
a social media advertisement, women c an review the study website and complete the screener online (see 
below) and  provide contact [CONTACT_688532].  At the time of the 
initial contact, women will be provided information regarding LinkPositively . Women will then express whether 
or not they are interested in the study.  
 
Depending on the preference of the potential participant, the following screening method may be employed:  
(1) If a potential participant would like to be screened by [CONTACT_7323], the study staff will seek verbal 
consent to screen the participant. If consent is obtained, then a 10 -minute screener will be conducted to 
assess eligibility. Screening questions will include age, biological sex, preferred gender identity, pregnancy 
status, HIV status, and sexual and reproductive history. (2) If a potential participant would like to be screened 
digitally for eligibility, the potential participant can follow a  link on the advertisement, the study website, or via a 
link sent to them directly by [CONTACT_5984]. This link will take them to an eligibility screener via REDCap survey  
 
 
Biomedical IRB Application Instructions  
Page [ADDRESS_933927] year physical and/or  sexual violence, and  substance and alcohol use. Due to the highly 
sensitive nature of this study , ability of potential participants to screen digitally will reduce participant burden in 
the screening process and increase participant options in the screening process, as is aligned with a trauma -
informed approach to working with  WLHA . 
  
After eligibilit y is determined, eligible participants  who screened through REDCap will be asked to provide the 
study staff with their contact [CONTACT_3031]  (phone number, email address) , along with the names and 
corresponding contact [CONTACT_3031] (e.g. phone number) of up to [ADDRESS_933928] the participants for study initial visits and/or follow -up visits. The research 
team will only contact [CONTACT_688533] 10 attempts (total) 
on different days and times using the contact [CONTACT_688534].  Eligible 
participants who are recruited through Build Clinical will provide contact [CONTACT_688535], which is kept secure using server authentication  and data encryptio ns that 
are the same as those used in healthcare institutions. Data is transmitted via HTTPS, and Build Clinicals uses 
a Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.[ADDRESS_933929] Coordinator to schedule a baseline 
study visit at the UCSD Antiviral Research Center  in San Diego County, the Charles R. Drew University 
Clinical and Translational Science Institute in Los Angeles County, WORLD in Alameda County , and at 
Guiding Right, Inc. offices in Oklahoma City and Tulsa Counties.  At the baseline visit, participants will review 
and sign informed consent documentation to be enrolled in the study.  
 
Study Visit Procedures  
 
AIM 1  
 
In Phase 1 (Aim 1), interested WHLA, Peer Navigators, and Key Informants will participate in one focus group 
or in-depth interview, lasting approximately [ADDRESS_933930]  (The Webster Building) , a centrally located neighborhood in San Diego. Key 
Informant Interviews will occur at a location convenient for the key informant, such as their office. Each 
session will last approximately 2 hours and will be  conducted in English. Participa nts will be asked to review 
and sign the informed consent form, which will  explain the study procedures, confidentiality, risks and benefits 
of participation, and payment incentives.  Participants will be given the opportunity to ask questions about 
interview procedures, and “group rules” will be  reviewed prior to beginning the session (in the case of the 
FGs). To ensure confidentiality, participants will be  asked to use a pseudonym in lieu of their name. 
Participants will also be asked to sign a confidentia lity clause  and encouraged to use and refer to each other 
by [CONTACT_688536].  FG and key informant interview questions will be developed by [CONTACT_688537]. Questions specific to smartphones and apps will include: (1) experiences with  
smartphones and apps; (2) important features in an app; (3) influences of decisions to download, use, and  
maintain apps; features desired in regularly used apps; (4) suggestions for content and features of an app to  
help engage women in HIV medical care and ancillary support services; (5) prompts provided based on  
proposed app components: video function, social networking, educational tips, and GPS -based locator 
service.  
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_688481], interpersonal violence, and associated mental illness and/or  
substance abuse will include: (1) aspects of HIV care most challenging to navigate as Black WLHA; (2) how  
barriers have been overcome, such as interpersonal violence, leading to improved engagement in HIV care or  
 
 
Biomedical IRB Application Instructions  
Page 10 other support services; (3) intersectional stigma due to being Black, a woman, HIV -positive, and affected by  
[CONTACT_688510], and distrust of the health care system; (4) type of appointments that clients would need  
support in; and (5) types of support needed after appointments (e.g., managing medication side effects). Next,  
participants will be informed that the research team is building a smartphone app to improve retention in HIV  
medical care and ART adherence, while linking to other ancillary support services (e.g., domestic violence,  
mental health, substance abuse). Participants will be asked to reflect on the following topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102]: (1) features and  
functions that would attract them to the app; (2) visual look of the app; (3) importance of photos or characters  
of people on app look like them or their friends; (4) thoughts on proposed name, LinkPositively and suggested  
changes; (5) feedback on notifications (usually called push notifications) that may pop up on the home screen  
or near the app; and (6) suggestions to address privacy and safety concerns. The FG or key informant  
interview will end by [CONTACT_688538], thanking them for their time, and compensating them $50 cash.  
 
In Phase 1 (Aim 1), we will conduct beta testing to obtain feedback from a small group of women on 
intervention  components, and to identify any navigation problems. Beta testing will be informed by [CONTACT_688539], design, and 
functionality of  the LinkPositively app. Screening and written informed consent will be  
conducted in -person. The consent will describe the purpose of usability testing and a description of the  
LinkPositively app to be tested. Women will be asked to download and navigate the LinkPositively app and 
reflect  upon their experiences over a 2 -week period. Specifically, we will ask women to provide feedback on 
their experiences with: 1) completion of a profile to be effectively linked to a matched virtual PN; 2) ease of 
initial text  or videoconference with virtual PN; 3) use and functionality of the social networking platform with 
other users; 4)  use of the resource center to identify one HIV service pro vider or organization, outside of the 
clinic or organization  they frequent, and 2 ancillary support service agencies (i.e., domestic violence, mental 
health, substance abuse),  and 5) educational tip functionality in terms of receiving tips and submitting 
questions.  
 
At the end of two weeks, [CONTACT_688573] or [CONTACT_688575] will conduct a semi -structured qualitative exit interview  
soliciting participant and Virtual PN feedback and suggestions specific to each intervention feature, noting  
suggestions for improvement. Participants will be asked to assess the LinkPositively app’s features usability,  
design, content, and functionality. Participants will also complete the 10 -item system usability scale (SUS), a  
validated, industry standard scale used to evaluate a variety of products and services, including websites, 
mobile  phones, and computer software. Virtual PNs will also participate in a FG where we will obtain feedback 
on navigating the Coach -User interface (e.g., video and phone feature to speak with women, texting 
appointment  reminders and private messages to women), difficulties with session content, satisfaction with the 
process (e.g.,  linkage to external support services, support networks, match between  PN and client), and 
suggestions for  improvements. Upon completion of a qualitative exit interview, participants will receive $[ADDRESS_933931] of common problems, and recommended design -improvements that will be 
used in the  final iterative stages of app development.  
 
After beta testing is completed, we will share findings with the CAB and improve the  LinkPositively app design, 
content, and functionality based on findings from the usability testing process. Drs.  Horvath and Stockman will 
meet with RCG to discuss refinements centered on the identified usability study  findings.  
 
AIM 2  
 
In Phase 2 (Aim 2), Participants enrolled in the study w ill attend three data collection study visits: Baseline 
(Month 0), Follow -Up 1 (Month 3), and Follow -Up 2 (Month 6) .  
 
Baseline Study Visit . Women who meet eligibility criteria and are interested in participating in the study will 
undergo the written informed consent process at their baseline visit . After consenting, participants will  provide 
contact [CONTACT_3031] (e.g., name, cell phone number, email address, and/or social media username) to  be 
 
 
Biomedical IRB Application Instructions  
Page 11 contact[CONTACT_51095] -up assessments. Informed consent, completion enrollment paperwork, and assessments 
will occur in field offices in  San Diego County (UC San Diego AntiViral Research Center, located at  [ADDRESS_933932]., Suite A, San Diego, [LOCATION_004] [ZIP_CODE]) , Los Angeles County (Charles R. Drew University of 
Medicine and Science, Clinical and Translational Science Institute, [ADDRESS_933933]., Los Angeles, 
[LOCATION_004] [ZIP_CODE]) , Alameda County (WORLD, located at [ADDRESS_933934]., Oakland, [LOCATION_004] [ZIP_CODE]) , Oklahoma 
City (Guiding Right Offices, [ADDRESS_933935] O klahoma City , Oklahoma [ZIP_CODE] ) and Tulsa County (Guiding Right, 
Inc.,[ADDRESS_933936] Tulsa, O klahoma  [ZIP_CODE] ). Following the baseline visit, participants  will be randomized  
using a randomization sequence at a 1:1 ratio into the intervention or control arm on a rolling  basis.   
 
All Study Visits.  At all study visits (Baseline, Follow -Up 1, Follow -Up 2), participants will undergo an  
interviewer -administered quantitative survey and biological sample collection (hair). An increasing payment 
schedule will be used to enhance motivation to complete surveys. Specifically, women will receive $25 for 
completing the baseline visit, $30 for completing the 3 -month follow -up visit, and $40 for com pleting the 6-
month follow -up visit , with a $[ADDRESS_933937] access to a face mask, one will be provided to them upon entry to the 
private research office space . Additionally, all participants will be screened for symptoms of COVID -19 by [CONTACT_688540] -person study visits, and again upon arrival at the private 
research office space . 
 
Quantitative Survey. The quantitative survey will include the following sections: (1) Demographic questions 
(e.g. age, biological sex at birth, gender identity, race/ethnicity, education, sexual orientation, marital status, 
employment, number of children, housing status, medic al insurance status, food insecurity); (2) 
Socioeconomic status; (3) Mental health and behavioral health history (e.g. depression, anxiety, alcohol and 
substance use diagnosis and/or abstinence, lifetime history of trauma); (4) HIV car e and treatment history (e.g. 
obtaining medical care, usual source of medical care, treatments, medications, insurance status, barriers to 
HIV treatment, self -reported adherence, adherence self -efficacy); (5) Support and Copi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (e.g. social support, 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_78281]-efficacy, ancillary support utilization); (6) Health care interactions (e.g. HIV stigma, medical 
mistrust) (7) Syndemic factors (e.g. interpersonal violence). [ See Quantitative  Survey].  
 
Biological Sample Collection. After completion of the interviewer -administered  survey at baseline, [ADDRESS_933938] Coordinator  or Research Associate  (trained in hair sample collection by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. 
Gandhi) will retrieve a hair sample  from participants. All participants will be compensated $25 per visit, upon 
completion of hair sample collection. The hair sample  collection kit  is comprised of scissors, pi[INVESTIGATOR_18090], 
two patient labels, plastic (e.g., Ziploc) bag, alcohol swabs, and  desicc ant pellet. The following steps will be 
followed for hair sample collection: (1) Clean the blades of a pair of  scissors with an alcohol pad; (2) Lift up the 
top layer of hair from the occipi[INVESTIGATOR_688482]’s head . Isolate a  small 
thatch of hair (~100 fibers of hair) from underneath this top layer; (3) Cut the small hair sample as close  to the 
scalp as possible. For short or cropped hair, the Project Coordinator can let hair fall directly into the  pi[INVESTIGATOR_688483]. For  braided hair, cut hair thatch from in -between braids or dread locks; (4) Keep fingers on the  part of the 
hair that was furthest away from the scalp and put the hair sample down on an unfolded pi[INVESTIGATOR_688484]; (5) 
Put a thin label over the end of the hair sample that was furthest away from the scalp; (6) Refold the foil  over 
to completely enclose the hair and place a study ID label on the folded pi[INVESTIGATOR_18087]; (7) Place the folded  pi[INVESTIGATOR_688485]. Hair samples will then be securely mailed to the UCSF  Hair 
Analytical Laboratory, led by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Gandhi , where liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry will be  used 
to assess antiretroviral concentrations in hair samples over the past 3 months (3cm of hair). Given the ongoing 
COVID -[ADDRESS_933939] (baseline) visit, and 
given labeled kits for self -collection of hair samples at home should the participant’s follow -up visit occur 
virtually. If the follow -up visits occur virtually, study staff will arrange a date and time to pi[INVESTIGATOR_688486] a location convenient and safe for the participant, shortly after the virtual study visit.  
 
 
 
Biomedical IRB Application Instructions  
Page [ADDRESS_933940] Chart Abstraction  
During the passive follow -up period (7-[ADDRESS_933941] -baseline ), the research team will utilize the signed 
Release of Information (ROI) forms and HIPAA Authorization Forms of all study participants (participant 
consent collected at Baseline Study Visit), in order to request medical chart data for all participants fro m local 
HIV care providers  to obtain  data on clinic visits, HIV viral load, and CD4 values. Data will be entered into the 
REDCap Electronic Data Capturing System. These medical chart data extrac tions will be conducted 
periodically, given the staggered enrollment period.  
 
To safeguard confidentiality, for the quantitative data collection, each participant will receive a unique patient 
identification number (PID) and names will never be used in conjunction with PID numbers. This unique PID 
number will appear on the survey, t racking forms (e.g., scrip payment receipt, c ell phone tracking form) , 
locator and screening forms. Participant confidentiality will be maintained through use of the unique PID and 
secure networks where data are stored. All laboratory data will be electron ically transferred to the UCSD Data 
Management Center via password protected electronic files. At the UCSD Data Management Center, all 
computer files will be identifiable only by [CONTACT_688541].  
 
Intervention Trial:  
 
Treatment Conditions . Following the Baseline Visit, participants will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio to an 
intervention arm or control arm. The Biostatistician team will generate the randomization sequence to ensure 
that randomization occurs independent of the core research team.  Participants will be informed of their study 
group assignment immediately after completion of their baseline survey.  
 
Control Arm.  Women assigned to the control arm will be connected with and will receive self -directed (non -
Peer Navigation supported) treatment as usual at agencies and institutions in San Diego , Los Angeles,   
Alameda , Oklahoma City, or Tulsa  County following the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program standard of care (i.e., 
referrals to physical, dental, and mental health services; medical case management; and ancillary services 
[e.g., alcohol/substance use recovery, family support] ). Women who are not already receivi ng services and do 
not have other means of receiving services or are not under medical case management elsewhere will be 
referred to care . Alternatively, women may request case management services via Ryan White HIV/AIDS 
Program at a preferred location . 
 
Using the Ryan White standards of care, g oals will be set to create an individual care plan related to medical 
care, housing, financial, and other resources as needed. Referrals will be made to appropriate services (e.g., 
primary care, housing, benefits counseling, transportation, food, legal ser vices, support services) based on 
intake interview. Women who require a higher level of care (e.g., significant mental health concern, at risk or 
falling out of care) and do not have other means of receiving service s or are not under medical case 
management elsewhere may reques t case management services via Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program  in San 
Diego , Los Angeles, Alameda , Oklahoma City, or Tulsa  County.  
 
Participants  requiring medical case management will have a case file that provides appropriate participant  
follow -up and tracking information. Case Managers will have in -person contact [CONTACT_688542] [ADDRESS_933942] her to HIV medical care via local health clinics 
and identify  other areas of need, services of need, and assisted referrals. These areas i nclude but are not 
limited to domestic  violence services, mental health care, substance abuse treatment, and housing and legal 
support. PNs will  provide trauma -informed, intensive emotional and informational support, including guidance 
on accessing  information (e.g., agency name, address, website, contact [CONTACT_3031]) about referred services.  
 
The LinkPositively App will deploy the following interactive components:  
 
1. Social Networking.  We will develop a platform for Black WLHA with a lifetime history of interpersonal 
violence to connect with each other via a social networking feed (similar to Facebook). Users will 
create a user Social Networking Profile by [CONTACT_688543], avatar  (virtual character to 
represent themselves), and include any information they wish to share about themselves. The user 
profiles will be monitored and protected from personal -identifying information, in order to maintain the 
participant’s  confidentiality. Within the feed, users will have the opportunity to share information, 
stories, and successes, as well as ask questions and advice from the other women via posts. The 
platform will be interactive, as users will be able to react to (via ic ons including thumbs up, heart, smile 
emoji’s) and comment on user’s posts. The platform content (including posts and information shared) 
will be monitored daily by [CONTACT_688544], 
language, and  actions are upheld. The feed will not be accessible to the PNs, in order to allow all 
participants to engage with each other without the bias of PNs and to limit contamination in the 
evaluation on the preliminary effects of the separate components of Link Positively.  
 
2. Education and Self -Care Tips.  We will create [ADDRESS_933943] strategies for overcoming the effects of interpersonal violence (e.g., 
adverse mental health, substance abuse). Tips will rotate daily; such that [ADDRESS_933944] levels with 
corresponding points will then unlock new features in the app. Such features will include videos that 
promote self -care (e.g., guided mindfulness meditation, yoga as therapy, exercise, etc.),  as well as 
education and empowerment (e.g., testimonials from survivors of interpersonal violence), which will be 
embedded into the app at designated levels. These features will be unlocked for users as they meet 
each level. Women will be able to see their current level status and  how many points they need to 
unlock additional  self-care and educational videos and testimonials in the profile area to encourage use 
and engagement.  
 
3. Resource Locator.  A resource database will be developed by [CONTACT_688545], domestic violence, and other ancillary support service agencies nearby. Women will be 
able to search the database for specific services (e.g., HIV care; Financial, Me ntal Health; Substance 
Abuse) in a specified radius (e.g., 5 miles, 20 miles, 50 miles), which will generate a list of 
organizations and their characteristics, such as address, phone number, type of organization (i.e., HIV, 
interpersonal v iolence [e.g., domestic violence shelters], mental health, substance use), website URL, 
days/hours of operation, service eligibility requirements (if any), fee information, clinical and support 
services offered (e.g. HIV testing, HIV treatment, STD testing , domestic violence shelters, rape crisis 
centers, mental health counseling/therapy, support groups, substance use programs). By [CONTACT_688546], the smartphone’s GPS mappi[INVESTIGATOR_688487]’s location relative to the 
agency locati ons. Users will have the option to apply filters to the resource list by [CONTACT_688547] 14 characteristics, in order to display specific agencies based on desired needs or characteristics. There 
will also be the opportunity for users to comment and rate the agency, similar to Yelp functionality.  
 
4. ART Self -monitoring and Reminders . Within the notification center of the app, users will receive 
automated medication reminders and appointment reminders, and will be prompted to respond in real 
time to whether or not they took their medications that day and whether or not they attended t heir 
scheduled appointments.  
 
5. Virtual Peer Navigation.  Study participants will be matched with a trained, trauma -informed virtual PN — 
based on shared lived experiences —who deliver this component of the intervention using a HIPPA -
compliant videoconferencing software, Zoom Conference. Participants can link to their Zoom PN 
meeting by [CONTACT_116828] a link within the LinkPositively app to connect with their matched PN. First, the 
assigned PNs will conduct an intake/needs assessment and create goals, case plan with their assigned 
clients, dis cuss ways to maximize the effectiveness of the LinkPositively app, and link clients to HIV 
medical care and ancillary support services, as well as other local resources. Next, a total of 5 
structured PN sessions will occur over a five-week period. Two sessions will focus on emotional 
intelligence: (a) increasing emotional awareness, understanding trauma and other co -occurring 
syndemic conditions (e.g., mental health disorders, substance abuse) including emotional responses to 
them, and  (b) cultivating emoti onal regulation and distress tolerance, specific to PTSD following 
interpersonal violence. The third  session will focus on activating social support networks, specifically, 
identifying and changing relationship patterns (i.e., understanding negative relationship patterns based 
on interpersonal violence experiences and other syndemic conditions and identif ication of alternative 
and more adaptive interpersonal schemas). The fourth  session will address how interpersonal violence 
(e.g., power and control dynamics, disclosure of violence) can impact existing socio -structural barriers 
(e.g., HIV stigma, medical mistrust) and developi[INVESTIGATOR_688488]. The fifth and final session will focus on aspects of medical mistrust and 
discrimination in the context of HIV care and discuss skills to improve patient -provider communication. 
Each session will last 1 hour and occur at a convenient time for the participant. Women will be able to 
text/call their PN during and after the 5-week period if they have questions or seek to debrief after 
sessions or appointments. In t he backend of the website app, PNs will enter case notes on PN 
sessions and check -ins, set notifications and appointment reminders, and send their assigned 
participants direct messages that will show up only on that participant’s profile. PNs will also be able to 
view women’s responses in the real time data on medication and appointment outcomes, to inform 
their upcoming session and/or check -in. In addition to video conference/phone sessions and check -ins, 
participants will receive automated daily medicatio n reminder text messages, scheduled  appointment 
alerts, and access daily postings in the education and self -care tips component of the app.  
 
After completion of each  intervention activit y, participants enrolled in the intervention group will receive an 
email with a link to complete a brief evaluation of the intervention. Completion of this evaluation is voluntary.  
 
Retention of Participants  
 
AIM [ADDRESS_933945] to reach our sample size utilizing partnerships established through the UCSD Center for AIDS 
Research (CFAR) Disparities Core Community Advisory Board (CAB), of which [CONTACT_688573] is Director, and 
through standard outreach methods. Following othe r projects led by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Stockman and other members of the 
investigative team, we expect a retention rate of at least 85% in the first follow -up visit and another 80 % in the 
second follow -up visit. Never theless, we will strive to engage and maintain our sampl e. To do this, we will 
 
 
Biomedical IRB Application Instructions  
Page 15 implement tactics to improve retention.  Specifically, we will:  (1) Utilize a n increasing payment schedule to 
enhance motivation to complete study visits . Specifically, women  will be offered $30 and $40 for completing 3 - 
and 6 -month study visits , with a $10 bonus for completing all 3 study visits (2 ) collect contact [CONTACT_688548] (e.g., friends, family members) who would likely have knowledge of participants’ whereabouts; (3) 
provide study cell phone  number  for ease of study staff calling or texting  participant s and participant s calling or 
texting  study staff w ith any questions or concerns; (4 ) maintain frequent contact [CONTACT_46144] s to check in 
about their se rvice needs which include any linkages the study team can provide to resources in the 
community; and (5) as appropriate, sending text messages on participants’ personal cell phone or  assigned  
study cell phone with birthday and holiday greetings, and congratulations messages for graduations and other 
important events. We also will make it easy for participants to stay in touch with our team by [CONTACT_1541] a toll -
free phone number, email and web a ddresses (in addition to the study cell phone). Given our target sample 
size and short follow -up period, we are confident that the aforementioned approaches will maximize retention 
in our study.  
 
Data Management  
Quantitative data will be managed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Jain . The study staff will be responsible for questionnaire 
development and coding of the survey. Through the UCSD Central and Translational Research Institute  
(CTRI) , the research team will utilize REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) application for quantitative 
data. REDCap is a secure, password protected, HIPAA compliant web -based application for building and 
managing online surveys and databases. Laptop and/o r tablets will be used for survey data collection  using 
the REDCap application. Each survey  file will be digitally stamped with the user, date and time of use, 
machine information. All computer files in the field will be automatically backed up. The project coordinator will 
be trained to extract and compi[INVESTIGATOR_688489]; encrypted, password protected files will be sent weekly to [CONTACT_688576].  Each study participant will have a unique identifier. No personal information will be recorded in the 
surveys. A UCSD data manager will merge all REDCap datasets togeth er, reconcile them into a standard 
version, and export a final REDCap dataset into SAS or SPSS data sets, instantly ready to use by [CONTACT_688549]. To ensure quality of the data collection, the data manager  will make bi -weekly tracking and 
missing data reports. Hard copi[INVESTIGATOR_688490] a locked filing 
cabinet, available to study personnel if data concerns arise. Study investigators will refer to these field notes 
as necessary in the coding and ana lysis stages. All data will be backed up daily and stored using password 
protection.  [CONTACT_137279] will merge data,  reconcile them into  a standard version, and export into a SAS dataset. 
Biomarker data from UCSF’s HAL laboratory (hair samples), will be  sent weekly to the UCSD research team  
via password protected electronic files.  
 
 
10. HUMAN SUBJECTS  
 
Human Subjects  
Anticipated W LHA dem ographics to be enrolled in LinkPositively.  
 
AIM 1  
 
In Phase 1 (Aim 1), we will conduct focus groups (FGs) and in -depth interviews. Eligible participants will be 
Black WLHA  (including transgender women)  with a History of Interpersonal Violence (n=6 -8 per FG; total of 4 
FGs) ; Black WLHA (including transgender women) with a History of Interpersonal Violence who act in a 
professional capacity as a Peer Navigator  (n=4-6; one FG) . Key Informants (n=4 -6) will be leadership at local 
clinics and community -based organizations known to provide services to women in the  areas of HIV/AIDS care 
and domestic violence services such as UCSD Owen Clinic and Mental Health America.  Phase 1 will 
culminate in usability testing, Beta Testing, by [CONTACT_688524] (n=8 ; 4 with 
histories of interpersonal violence perpetrated by a current or former intimate partner and 4 with histories of 
interpersonal violence perpetrated by a non -intimate  partner [e.g., family member, friend, stranger]) , to finalize 
intervention components and procedures.    
 
 
 
Biomedical IRB Application Instructions  
Page 16 AIM 2  
 
In Phase 2 (Aim 2), we will conduct a randomized control trial study design with follow -up. E ligible participants  
will self -report: (a) female gender  (including transgender women) , (b) Black or African American racial/ethnic 
background, (c) ages 18+ years,  (d) HIV -positive status, (e) ever experienced physical, sexual, and/or 
psychological abuse by a current or former partner or non -partner (e.g., relative, friend, stranger), (f) owner of 
a smartphone with internet browsing  capabilities, and (g) English spe aking. Purposive sampling will be used to 
ensure that groups are balanced  with respect to type of perpetrator (current or former intimate partners [e.g., 
spouse, boyfriend, dating, casual]  and non - intimate partners [e.g., family member, friend, stranger]) and 
retention in HIV medical care status  (linked to care but have fallen out of care [i.e., no ART prescription filled, 
no viral load labs, or no HIV care  visits with an ART -prescribing provider in the past year] versus linked to and 
retained in care [i.e ., ART  prescription filled, viral load labs, or HIV care visits with an ART prescribing provider 
in the past year]). The total possible sample size for the study will be 80 women living with HIV/AIDS (WLHA). 
Of 80 enrolled women, 40 will be randomized to the intervention arm and 40 will be randomized to the control 
arm.  
 
Eligibility  
The following eligibility criteria will apply to all W LHA enrolled into the  study, including WHLA FGs, Peer 
Navigator FGs, Beta Testing, and the Randomized Control Trial:  
 
Inclusion criteria:  
• Aged 18 years or older  
• Self-identification as a c is-gender or transgender woman  
• Self-identification as Black or African American  
• Living with HIV/AIDS  
• Ability to speak and understand English  
• Ever-experienced physical, sexual, and/or psychological abuse by a current or former partner or non -
partner  
• Owner of a smartphone with internet browsing capabilities  
 
Exclusion criteria:  
• Unwillingness to participate in the study  
• Cognitive impairment that would limit participation with study procedures  
 
The interviewer will assess cognitive impairment. If during the consent process, a participant appears to be 
suffering from paranoia, auditory hallucinations, has sporadic outbursts, or is not capable of comprehending 
the interview or materials, she will b e excluded from the study. Although we may enroll transgender women 
due to ethical service -delivery considerations, we recognize that trans -tailored PN -based programs may be 
more ideal for this population. Additionally, although our sample is heterogeneous  in terms of where they fall 
on the HIV care continuum, they share similar experiences with interpersonal violence , which are the 
communality and focus of LinkPositively - to ultimately improve outcomes along the care continuum . 
 
11. RECRUITMENT AND PROCEDURES PREPARATORY TO RESEARCH  
 
Recruitment of Participants  
Eligible WLH A will be identified through the following methods:  
 
Social Media.  Social media outlets, including posting information about the study on an open Facebook group 
(e.g., local support groups for WLHA) and online ads that appear on Facebook  and Instagram . Our study team 
has previously been successful in recruiting hard -to-reach populations through this method. When running 
advertisements on social media, the comment option on advertisements will be turned off, so as to avoid 
inadvertently “outing” women w ith HIV. Additionally, Build Clinic will provide support for distribution of 
 
 
Biomedical IRB Application Instructions  
Page [ADDRESS_933946] same screening content.  
 
San Diego Center for AIDS Research (CFAR) Disparities Core . Outreach methods employed by [CONTACT_688550] (CFAR) Disparities Core will include distribution of flyers to community -based 
agencies that have been identified as potential recruitment locations of HIV -related research and have been  
included in a community partner database (n=20) housed within the San Diego CFAR Disparities Core. We will 
also utilize the recruitment and retention subcommittee of the Disparities Core Community Advisory Board 
(CAB) to promote and advertise the study and our need for Latina and Black women. The Disparities Core 
CAB is composed of Black and Latino health community leaders in San Diego. Specifically, the recruitment 
and retention subcommittee holds targeted outreach events at local community events and health fairs to 
speak to underserved groups, particularly, Blacks, Latinos, and American Indian/Native Americans about 
ongoing research and the need for their participation to address disparities in HI V research.  
 
Newspaper Advertisements . Advertisements will be run in local newspapers . [CONTACT_688573] has previously 
had significant success with the recruitment of women of color utilizing the San Diego Reader.  
 
Traditional Advertisement s. Flyer advertisements (ads) will include banner ads and flyers that will be posted 
at bus stops, libraries, transitional housing facilities, social service agencies, and businesses located in central 
San Diego , Los Angeles , Alameda , Oklahoma City, and Tulsa communities that have at least 10% or more 
Black and Latino residents.  
 
12. INFORMED CONSENT  
Verbal consent to screen potential participants for eligibility will be sought from all potential participants, and 
receipt of verbal consent to screen will be documented by [CONTACT_464]. Screening will occur using a telephone 
screening script.  
  
For eligible participants who choose to enroll, we anticipate that written informed consent will be obtained from 
all enrolled participants at the time of their in -person baseline study visit. t he informed consent process will 
follow all relevant regulatory guidelines and will generally include both verbal and written components obtained 
by [CONTACT_688551]. Documents and other communications will be developed 
to inf orm each potential research participant as clearly as possible  about the potential risks, benefits and 
alternative approaches available for each research study. In all currently foreseeable circumstances, 
documentation of informed consent will be in the form of a signed and witnessed written document in a 
language an d at a level that is appropriate to the patient population recruited. The informed consent procedure 
is designed to maximize the potential participant’s comprehension of study procedures and to ensure that 
participation is voluntary. Prior to study impleme ntation, we will seek approval from the UCSD Institutional 
Review Board (IRB) Committee on Human Research. The informed consent process, along with data 
collection will only occur in San Diego , Los Angeles, Alameda , Oklahoma City, and Tulsa  counties . 
 
In scenarios of high risk of infection (COVID -19), we are additionally requesting a Waiver of Documented 
Consent/Assent to obtain oral consent/assent , should we be unable to proceed with in -person data collection 
and consenting processes . The UCSD Human Resources Protection Program (HRPP) Institutional Review 
Board has classified this research as involving no more than minimal risk. Additionally, no procedures within 
the study require written consent outside of the research project. This will allow for the research team to enroll 
participants and focus groups and interviews via phone or video conference, significantly reducing the 
potential for exposure to infectious disease. Consent will be obtained by [CONTACT_688552]. 
Consent will be documented by [CONTACT_688553].  
 
13. ALTERNATIVES TO STUDY PARTICIPATION  
Participants will have the option to not participate in the study. Participants who are not interested in 
participating in the study are welcome to take  a referral list of local resources in the San Diego , Los Angeles, 
Alameda Oklahoma City, or Tulsa County  community (e.g., legal, support groups, childcare, etc.).

14. POTENTIAL RISKS  
 
Potential Risks  
The risks associated with participation in the study are primarily psychological, given the nature of factors 
associated with Black WLHA with a history of interpersonal violence. These risks are discussed below:  
 
Psychological Risks:  In the treatment group (intervention arm), participants may experience psychological 
distress while talking about issues (e.g., adverse mental health, intimate partner violence, HIV disclosure)  
raised during one -on-one sessions with virtual peer navigators and phone/text check -ins. Distress may also  
occur when participants are not interacting with the virtual peer navigator. In the standard of care group  
(control arm), participants may also experience distress. Participants will be aske d questions about mental  
health and intimate partner violence. As a result, participants may be uncomfortable or experience stress or  
emotional pain in responding to these questions. Participating in the intervention could also lead to self -
awareness  about the limitations of one’s knowledge of HIV care and treatment, as well as barriers  (e.g., 
substance use, adverse mental health, discrimination, etc.) . Participants may also disclose their HIV status for 
the first time to peers who are  enrolled and interact ing on the social networking platform, which may cause 
psychological distress.   
 
Physical Risks:  We will collect hair samples at [ADDRESS_933947]. Gandhi (Consultant) in hair sample collection procedures.  Confidentiality: 
There is potential for violation of participant confidentiality if others find o ut about participants’  HIV status or 
study participation. In addition, women who may be in an abusive relationship, may be concerned  that their 
partner will find out about their participation in the intervention. For eligible participants, as a result of  
participating in this study, it is possible that these participants may be identified by [CONTACT_2312], including law  
enforcement, such as those who may be a victim or perpetrator of violence.  
 
There is also some risk that the study personnel will receive reports of physical abuse and violence 
perpetrated against participants. These incidences will be handled per mandatory reporting protocols.  
 
Per IRB policy —violence that is related to the conduct of the protocol will be reported to the IRB as an adverse 
event. Violence unrelated to the protocol that is communicated during the information gathering associated 
with the protocol will be reported t o the authorities under state law, but would not be reportable as a research -
related adverse event. In the event of violence related to the study protocol, an incident report will be filed with 
the UCSD IRB. Also, if during the course of participating in a ny phase of the research study, the participant 
reveals current abuse/neglect or planned danger to self or others, the study personnel will report this to [CONTACT_688577] , who will make the appropriate referral as required by [CONTACT_2371].  
 
Loss of Confidentiality:  For eligible participants, as a result of participating in this study, it is possible that 
these participants may be identified by [CONTACT_2312], including law enforcement or healthcare personnel, as being a 
woman living with HIV/AIDS . We will  conduct interviews in private locations (i.e., UCSD clinic offices). There is 
also a slight risk that confidentiality may be breached in the management of data, although multiple safeguards 
will be implemented to avoid this risk. Participants will be  made aware of this risk during the consent procedure 
(see Data and Safet y Monitoring Plan, below).  
 
COVID -19: Given the ongoing COVID -[ADDRESS_933948] COVID . To mitigate this risk, all staff will undergo weekly COVID -19 testing, as per UCSD guidelines, 
complete a daily symptoms attestation, and utilize all appropriate personal protective equipment (facemask, 
faceshield, gloves, etc.). Additionally, all partic ipants will be asked to wear at least  a facemask (if the 
participant does not have access to a facemask, one will be provided to them), and any other protective 
 
 
Biomedical IRB Application Instructions  
Page [ADDRESS_933949] Risks:  
 
Procedures for minimizing potential risk to research participants will be directed and adapted to the 
participants, local agencies, and interventions required for each participant. Anticipated risks include increased 
stress or emotional pain from study participation. Research participants will be closely monitored by 
[CONTACT_688554], recognizing and mitigating these risks to 
the best of our abilities through out the conduct of the project.  
 
There is the possibility of physical risk to other during the course of the study. Previous UCSD IRB -approved 
research has established procedures to manage participant reports of violence affecting W LHA. The IRB 
policy at UCSD is that violence that is related to the conduct of the protocol must be reported to the IRB as an 
adverse event, whereas violence unrelated to the protocol that is incidentally communicated during the 
information -gathering procedu res associated with the protocol may be reportable to c ivil authorities under 
applicable laws (e.g., harm to adult or minor dependents), but would not be reportable as a research -related 
adverse event. In the event of violence related to our study, an incident report would need to be filed with the 
UCSD IRB. T o date, our team has not had a single report of violence related to our other projects that have 
been conducted with W LHA. If, during the course of an interview, assessment, or intervention session, a 
participant reveals current abuse or planned danger to others, the staff member will make the appropriate 
referral as required by [CONTACT_2371], and immediately inform the PI , Drs. Stockman within [ADDRESS_933950] copi[INVESTIGATOR_688491]; assigning alphanumeric codes without personally identifiable information to all 
recorded or transmitted data; maintaining strict electronic data security protocols for the management of all 
study related electronic data. Although there is inherent risk ass ociated with the systematic collection of any 
personal data, the data management protocols that have been developed within our university have been 
extremely effective over the past three decades. We will remain vigilant about data security and will modify  our 
procedures in response to any perceived or real risks to breaches in the security of our data.  Additionally, all 
audio recordings for data collection purposes will be destroyed one year after completion of the study.  
 
We will adhere to all applicable regulatory guidelines and local laws and regulations for patient confidentiality 
and safety monitoring and protection. We are aware of (and have substantial experience in) the DHHS 
regulations and OHRP guidance (45 CFR 46) required for research involving human subjects. All research 
staff have been trained and certified in human subjects’ protection, and certifications are updated every two 
years by [CONTACT_688555] -line CITI training,  as required by [CONTACT_137656]/NIAID.  
 
Our research and clinical staff will monitor all participants for adverse events. The first level of safety involves 
direct observation of and interaction with research participants by [CONTACT_688556]. In addi tion to interactions at protocol -specified visits, study participants are provided with 
multiple avenues of communication with research investigators and staff. These include unscheduled visits at 
the discretion of the study participant, telephone and inte rnet-facilitated communication. The second level of 
safety involves protocol -specified visits and laboratory studies that are tied to objective severity grading scales 
for assessment of adverse events. All adverse events are monitored by [CONTACT_411086] s taff and reviewed 
with study investigators. Adverse events of protocol -specified severity grade are reported to the institutional

(PI), an epi[INVESTIGATOR_47561], has over [ADDRESS_933952] confidential and sensitive 
interviews with vulnerable populations, including drug users and abused women. She will oversee all aspects of 
the study and ensure effective dissemination of findings. Additionally,  she will provide guidance on the design, 
implementation, data analysis, and disseminatio n of findings, as well as provide expertise on evaluation 
techniques and study implementation . In addition, the Research staff will receive extensive training in mixed 
methods research (e.g., informed consent, data collection, qualitative interviewing techniques, etc.) and 
approach questions with sensitivity and in a supportive manner.  All staff a re trained to connect participants to 
local resources ( e.g., legal, support groups, childcare, etc .) that are available at reduced or no cost.    
 
The UCSD team are established in training staff to conduct study activities (data collection and intervention 
sessions) in a confidential and sensitive manner that is responsive to the variability associated with interpersonal 
violence experiences among WLHA . [CONTACT_688573] will work closely with staff to support and monitor the study’s 
activities. All project staff will be trained to approach questions with sensitivity, in a supportive manner and to 
provide appropriate referrals when needed. All staff conduc ting interviews will be trained not to press participants 
to answer questions that seem to be distressing to them, and sessions will be terminated if the participant 
becomes too distressed, too fatigued, and/or too frustrated by [CONTACT_445090].  If participant s feel they are in need of 
psychological/mental health services, interviewers will refer the participant to counseling services or make 
arrangements to connect them with another local service agency, so that they may speak with someone about 
their concerns . Also, if during the course of the interview, the participant reveals planned danger to self or others, 
or child or elder abuse, the research team will report to San Diego , Los Angeles, Alameda , Oklahoma City, or 
Tulsa  County  law enforcement officials (police department and/or Child Protective Services) in accordance with 
State mandated reporter timelines and procedures.    
 
16. PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY CONSIDERATIONS INCLUDING DATA ACCESS AND 
MANAGEMENT  
Data will be managed by [CONTACT_688557] , which has 
substantial experience with managing and analyzing data from [CONTACT_688573]’s research projects. The 
following provisions will be taken depending on the data source.  
 
Participant Data  
Participant privacy will be protected during screening, study enrollment, and study sessions by [CONTACT_688558] a private office or meeting space at the following locations:  
 
San Diego County: UC San Diego AntiViral Research Center, located at  [ADDRESS_933953]., Suite A, San 
Diego, [LOCATION_004] [ZIP_CODE]  
 
Los Angeles County: Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science, Clinical and Translational Science 
Institute, [ADDRESS_933954]., Los Angeles, [LOCATION_004] [ZIP_CODE]  
 
Alameda County: WORLD, located at [ADDRESS_933955]., Oakland, [LOCATION_004] [ZIP_CODE]  
 
Oklahoma City County: Guiding Right, Inc., offices at multiple locations including [ADDRESS_933956] O klahoma City , 
Oklahoma [ZIP_CODE]  
 
 
 
Biomedical IRB Application Instructions  
Page 21 Tulsa County: Guiding Right, Inc., [ADDRESS_933957] copy and electronic data , will be identified only 
by [CONTACT_2299]’s study ID and will be protected against access by [CONTACT_688559]. Hard copy data  will be stored in locked  cabinets in secure offices at the Webste r Building, Suite 
302. Hard copy data forms and Peer Navigators notes  collected will be shredded [ADDRESS_933958]. Audio 
records will be transcribed verbatim and de -identified, and transcriptions will be stored in the same manner as 
all electronic data. Audio recordings will be destroyed one year after the com pletion of data collection.  
 
Electronic data,  specifically p articipant personal information will be kept in Ripple ™, a secure web application 
designed for the storing and management of personal identifying information of research participants. Ripple 
was initially developed at the University of Michigan to provide a user -friendly, web -based secure interface 
where resea rch teams can centralize the storage and management of research participants’ personal 
information, including name, participant ID, demographics, and study workflow (e.g. , appointments). 
Participant information managed with Ripple is private and secure. This information is kept in fully encrypted 
format inside dedicated databases that are segregated from other Ripple accounts and thus only authorized 
study staff will have access to the study data. Likewise, Ripple infrastructure complies with the privacy and 
security guidelines of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), including [ADDRESS_933959] strength estimation, and enterprise 
administrative safeguards to prevent unauthorized staff from accessing participant information.  Furthermore, 
Ripple is used only for storing personally identifiable information of participants and is not used to capture 
other research data (e.g., questionnaires, health records, etc.). This ensures that the personally identifiable 
information and res earch data are segregated.  No data electronic data shall be stored on any desktop 
computers, laptop computers, and/or agency computers in order to maintain confidentiality of participant data 
and project data integrity.  
 
All identified study records will be destroyed three years following completion of the study.  
 
Quantitative Survey Data  
The quantitative survey questionnaire development, management, and data entry will be conducted in 
Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap), which is a secure web application for building and managing 
online surveys and databases. REDCap is provided and m anaged by [CONTACT_688560] (ACTRI). REDCap is available to all UC San Diego faculty and staff, and to 
users outside the organization who have sponsorship from UC San Diego faculty. Tablets  and laptops  will b e 
used for de -identified data and quantitative survey data collection using REDCap. Each study participant will 
have a unique study identifier. No personal information will be recorded in the survey questionnaires. The 
Statistician and the Project Coordina tor will be trained to extract and compi[INVESTIGATOR_688492]. The Statistician 
will merge all data warehouses together, reconcile them into a standard version, and export a final data 
warehouse into a SAS dataset. No data electronic data shall be stored on  any desktop computers, laptop 
computers, and/or agency computers in order to maintain confidentiality of participant data and project data 
integrity.  
 
17. POTENTIAL BENEFITS  
There may be no benefit to you from participating in this research. Some participants may experience 
improved health as a result of linking to HIV treatment and ancillary support services. The potential benefit to 
others is substantial, in terms of reduced HIV -related morbidity/mortality and HIV infections averted via HIV 
Treatment as Prevention (TasP) methods that could become measurably more effective as a result of this 
research. Although our study is not designe d to reduce alcohol or drug use, WLHA who request it will be 
referred to substance abuse treatment services.  All participants will be provided with facilitated referrals for 
additional services (e.g., childcare, social services). Study participants may ben efit from this study by [CONTACT_104407] a 
sense of community and empowerment. Additional ly, participants may acquire  skills to learn to cope with 
 
 
Biomedical IRB Application Instructions  
Page 22 interpersonal violence  and navigate HIV care and ancillary support service agencies, self -confidence to 
navigate social support networks  from other peers utilizing LinkPositively, knowledge from the 
EducatedPositively database (that contains  healthy living and self -care tips), and social support from other 
peers utilizing LinkPositively. The study investigators will regularly review the unique risk -benefit ratio for each 
participant, with both global and local considerations in mind.  
 
18. RISK/BENEFIT RATIO  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_688493] (through linking Black WLHA also affected by [CONTACT_688561], and supporting the deployment of 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_688494]) to outweigh the risks 
to participants, which ha ve been shown to be effectively manageable through our prior research.  
19. EXPENSE TO PARTICIPANT  
There will be no charge to participants for any of the procedures conducted for the study or at the study office. 
Participants may incur treatment costs if they choose to link to medical care for their HIV diagnosis. Those 
costs will vary depending upon wh ere the participant seeks care and her insurance coverage. For most 
participants, HIV medical care will be available at little -to-no charge through programs offered by [CONTACT_688562], 
MediCal, and local Ryan White -funded services. Neither the participant nor any one else will be billed for 
participation in this research study.  
 
20. COMPENSATION FOR PARTICIPATION  
Participants will receive compensation, once completing each of the following:  
 
Phase 1 (Aim 1):  
• Focus Groups ($50) [24 -32 participants]  
• Key Informant Interviews ($50) [4 -6 participants]  
• Beta Testing ($50) [8 participants]  
 
Compensation for Phase 1 participants will be $50 total.

in the School of Medicine at Stanford University and Associate Director of Research in  the Division of 
Dissemination and Training at the National Center for Post -Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)  located at the 
Palo Alto VA Health Care Service. For the past [ADDRESS_933964] and Interpersonal Regulation STAIR Program, which is an evidence -based  cognitive 
behavioral therapy for individuals suffering from chronic and complicated forms of PTSD, as well  as for 
individuals with PTSD and co -occurring disorders (i.e., syndemic factors such as substance use and  adverse 
ment al health). [CONTACT_688570] has an ongoing collaboration with [CONTACT_688581] n with the goal of incorporating skills 
training in affect and interpersonal regulation to help women living with HIV. For the proposed project, [CONTACT_688582] will provide guidance in the development phase of the project as it relates to the intervention 
component  
focusing on helpi[INVESTIGATOR_688500] -related affective distress and  
training of Virtual Peer Navigators in this area. This intervention component will be adapted from [CONTACT_688570]’s  
ongoing work in this area. [CONTACT_688570] will also provide guidance on the implementation and evaluation phases 
of the intervention. [CONTACT_688570] will lend her expertise in the area of interpretation of study findings (working with 
Drs. Stockman and Horvath) and contribute to the preparati on of manuscripts.  
 
Monica Gandhi, MD, MPH (Consultant) . [CONTACT_18134] is a Professor of Medicine  and Associate Division Chief 
(Clinical Operations/ Education) of the Division of HIV, Infectious Diseases, and  Global Medicine at University 
of [LOCATION_004], San Francisco (UCSF). She also serves as the Medical Director of  the HIV Clinic ("Ward 86") at 
San Francisco General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. [CONTACT_18134] is a leading HIV physician, researcher  and Director of the Hair 
Analytical Laboratory (HAL) at UCSF where she has pi[INVESTIGATOR_688501] (ARV) adherence and exposure. Given the limitations of self -report to  monitor adherence, 
our methods to analyze antiretroviral concentrations in small hair samples provide an  objective biomarker of 
adherence and exposure to treatment in HIV infected individuals. [CONTACT_18134] has found  that hair levels of 
ARVs are the strongest independent predictor of treatment outco mes in the context of HIV and  have also 
shown a dose -dependent relationship between numbers of doses of ARVs consumed per week and  
concentrations in hair, enabling us to estimate the average level of adherence to ARVs based on hair levels.  
Moreover, [CONTACT_18134] has examined the acceptability and feasibility of hair collection in a number of health  
settings and found hair collection and analysis to be highly feasible. Finally, she and her team have found hair  
levels of ARVs to increase pre -and-post adherence interventions in multiple settings. For the proposed project,  
[CONTACT_18134] will provide guidance on the appropriate collection methods for the hair samples and training of  
research team staff. UCSF’s HAL, led by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Gandhi, will conduct the assays of antiretroviral concentrations in  
hair samples using sensitive methods employing liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. Lastly, 
[CONTACT_688583] will help in the interpretation of the ARV drug concentration data in the analytic phase of the study.

sample collection: (1) Clean the blades of a pair of  scissors with an alcohol pad; (2) Lift up the top layer of hair 
from the occipi[INVESTIGATOR_18085]. Isolate a  small thatch of hair (~100 fibers of hair) from underneath this 
top layer; (3) Cut the small hair sample as close  to the scalp as possible. For short or cropped hair, the Project 
Coordinator can let hair fall directly into the  pi[INVESTIGATOR_18090]. For braided hair, cut hair thatch from in -between 
braids or dread locks; (4) Keep fingers on the  part of the hair that was furthest away from the scalp and put the 
hair sample down on an unfolded pi[INVESTIGATOR_688484]; (5) Put a thin label over the end of the hair sample that was 
furthest away from the scalp; (6) Refold the foil  over to completely enclose the hair and place a study ID label 
on the folded pi[INVESTIGATOR_18087]; (7) Place the folded  pi[INVESTIGATOR_688507].  
 
The hair samples  will then be securely mailed to the UCSF  Hair Analytical Laboratory, led by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Gandhi, 
where liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry will be  used to assess antiretroviral concentrations in 
hair samples over the past 3 months (3cm of hair).   
 
Given the above plan, a biological materials transfer agreement (MTA) will be secured prior to any biological 
sample transfer between UC San Diego and UC San Francisco.

Page [ADDRESS_933980] step in assessing feasibility of delivering the intervention was by [CONTACT_40397] a 
Consort flow diagram tracking screening, eligibility, decision to participate, participation at 
baseline, and participation at 3 -month and 6 -month follow -ups. The second s tep in assessing 
feasibility was to compute the percentage of participants at baseline who were retained at 3 -
month follow -up and 6 -month follow -up, and comparing proportion trends between the 
intervention and control groups. We used the fo llowing retention cut -off percentages to assess 
feasibility: a) 90+% = strong feasibility; b) 80 -89% = acceptable feasibility; c) 70 -79% = modest 
feasibility with a need for improvement; d) <70% = unacceptable.  
 
Acceptability  We assessed acceptability of the intervention by [CONTACT_688567]: 1) the quality rating of the program/app, 2) whether or not they 
received the type of program/app they were anticipating, 3) to what extent the program/ app met 
their needs, 4) whether or not they would recommend the program/app, 5) level of satisfaction 
with the help received; 6) whether or not the program helped them deal more effectively with 
their problems, 7) level of satisfaction with t he program received, and 8) whether or not they 
would seek help from the program/app again.  
 
These measures of acceptability were assessed at both [ADDRESS_933981] of the intervention on primary outcomes 
we examined differences  by [CONTACT_19313] (intervention vs control)  in responses to HIV care outcomes 
over time, ART adherence over time, and mental health outcomes over time. Responses were 
collected at baseline, 3 -month follow -up, and 6 -month follow -up. Due to the small n’s, we 
calculated median scores and interquartile ranges for all continuous variables, and 
frequency/percentages for categorical variables. These statis tics were stratified by [CONTACT_19313], and 
trends were compared, but significance could not be calculated due to low power.

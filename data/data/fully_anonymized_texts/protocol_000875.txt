Background  
Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is the second most common progressive neurodegenerative disorder   
affecting older adults in the [LOCATION_002] and is predicted to increase in prevalence as the national 
population ages  [1]–[3]. PD is characterized by [CONTACT_11722], rigidity,  tremor, postural instability,  and gait disorders  [1]–[5]. Current 
management of the disease has centered on pharmacological solutions  [6], but even with optimal drug 
treatment, individuals still experience a deterioration in motor  function, mobility , cognition, and daily 
activities [5], [7], [8] . This can lead to decreased independence , inac tivity [9], social isolation [8], and 
reduced quality of life [8]. However, a growing body of research suggests that exercise therapy  in 
conjunction with drug therapy can help slow down the degenerative process and even improve motor 
function  [7], [10] –[24]. Unfortunately, access to intensive rehabilitation is limited, which often results in 
suboptimal dosages of exercis e therapy [25]–[27]. In fact, one study by [CONTACT_11723]., [27] found that at 
[ADDRESS_11131] 41% of individuals with PD were receiving physical therapy and only 16% 
were receiving  occupational therapy. Long -term, frequent exercise therapy is necessary to maximize and 
maintain benefits [10], [13], [21], [28] –[32] and thus must become a routine part of everyday life for 
individuals with PD. Engaging home therapy options that encourage therape utic exercise could increase 
the dosage and long -term duration of therapy individuals receive . However, most home -based exercise 
equipment ( e.g.,  a treadmill) is not optimized to safely promote activity in older individuals with PD. 
Indeed, there remains  a tremendous need for home exercise technology that is specifically tailored to 
address the problems faced by [CONTACT_11724].  
Recognizing this, we developed a  computer -guided, in -home exercise system for promoting exercise 
in individuals  with PD, called FitMi PD.  The system consists of two wireless input devices (“ Pucks”) that 
measure movement  (via inertial sensors) , compression force, and touch events, and provide haptic 
feedback in the form of vibration . The Pucks communicate  with exercise software on a computer or tablet 
to sense and direct exercises. The software analyzes the sensor inputs in real -time, detecting when an 
individual completes a  repetition of a target exercise  and provid ing motivating feedback  to users.  
 
Study  Design  
 
We evaluated the usability of FitMi PD in a three -week at -home study with 9 individuals with mild to 
moderate PD.  All participants were provided with a FitMi PD system and were instructed to exercise for a 
total of 3 hours per week at the times and durations of their choosing for 3 weeks.  
 
Methods  
 
Inclusion criteria include d a diagnosis of mild to moderate PD ( Hoeh n and Yahr stage I to III  [33]), Mini -
Mental State Examination  [34] greater than 28 , and age younger than  85 years old . All participants 
provide d informed consent. After obtaining consent, participants were invited to use FitMi PD under 
supervision from a study administrator who provide d initial instruction on h ow the system works and then 
guide d the users through a practice session. Participants played through a few exercises in the software 
until they ha d demonstrated that they c ould  use the system on their own. Following  the supervised 
practice session, participa nts w ere invited to take home a FitMi PD system with tablet and exercise 
software pre -installed. They w ere instructed to exercise for a total of 3 hours/week at the times and 
durations of their choosing for [ADDRESS_11132].  
After 3 weeks, participants return ed for follow -up. At this point, the total number of hours of exercise 
therapy the users performed w as extracted fro m the tablet. We will also solicit ed usability feedback from 
participants and their caregivers .  
 
 
Results and Statistical Analysis  
 
We recruited 9 individuals (4 Male, 5 Female) with a diagnosis of mild to moderate PD (Hoehn and 
Yahr stage I to III). The mean age of participants was 57 (range: 45 to 77 years) and mean time since 
diagnosis was 4 years (range: 1 to 10 years). Seven  out of 9 participant s successfully used FitMi PD to 
perform exercises at home , with the total number of exercise repetitions ranging from around 350 to 
10,000. For the two participants who did not use the FitMi PD system: one did not feel comfortable 
exercising witho ut their caregiver, who unexpectedly moved away shortly after enrollment; the other 
participant attempted a standing exercise even though their therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11718], which discouraged them from parti cipating further.  No safety 
concerns or adverse events were reported. No additional statistical analyses were performed due to the 
small sample size of the study

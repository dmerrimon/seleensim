 WE CHATT: A PI[INVESTIGATOR_542995] -YOUTH COMMUNICATION AND 
MEDICAL DECISION MAKING  
BACKGROUND  
Prevalence and Impact of Pediatric Heart Failure. Congenital heart disease (CHD), the most 
common birth defect, impact 1 in every 100 live births.36,37 Due to significant medical 
advancements, many children born with CHD now survive into adolescence and beyond. In 
1985, CHD patients were on average 11 years old. In 2000, the mean age had increased to 17 
years old.38 For the growing population of adolescents and young adults (AYAs; 12- 24 years) 
with congenital and acquired heart diseases, survival comes at a cost. Common complications, including heart failure and arrhythmias, require intensive, long-term medical care which has a 
significant financial impact on society. An estimated [ADDRESS_708667] tw o decades. Among this group, 7% die during their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] – a mortality rate nearly

devices as a bridge to transplant or destination therapy (i.e., life -extending intervention for 
patients who do not meet criteria for transplantation), mortality and morbidity are significant with 
high rates of stroke, bleeding and sepsis.33 In PI’s study  of medical decision making preferences 
among AYAs pre- heart transplant or post -transplant with serious complications, 6/16 eligible 
participants (38%) died before study enrollment/completion. Young people who die of heart failure overwhelmingly do so in i ntensive care settings.
30 Rates of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -based deaths 
accompanied by [CONTACT_543001]. For example, more than 50% of youth with progressive cancer die at home. Of those with cancer who died in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_69225], 45% received mechanical ventilation within the last 24 
hours of life
40 compared to 86% of youth who died of heart disease.30 
 
Palliative and End of Life Care in Heart Failure. The 2014 Institute of Medicine (IOM) report, Dying in America: Improving Quality and Honoring Individual Preferences Near End of Life,
29 
highlighted a critical need for “increased understanding of ways to improve participation in 
effective advance care planning and shared decision making among patients and families, including seriously ill children and adolescents, who may be able to participate actively in their 
health care decision making throughout their lives and as they approach death, and receive 
medical and related social services consistent with their values, goals and informed 
preferences.” Research on the end of life and palliative care needs of the growing AYA heart failure population is very limited.
30–[ADDRESS_708670] noted palliative care involvement to be associated with 
improved patient and family satisfaction, enhanced communication with medical providers, increased access to community and social supports, and reduced medical costs.
42 As such, it 
has been recommended that interdisciplinary supportive care be provided throughout the heart failure course with early engagement in advance care planning (i.e., discussing one’s wishes 
Page 2 of 4 
 and surrogate decision maker if unable to engage in medical decision making) due to 
challenges with prognostication and risk of sudden death in heart failure populations.43  
Communication in Heart Failure.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_542997]43 and other professional 
guidelines that recommend all adults with CHD participate in advance care planning,44 minimal 
prognostic, advance care planning and end of life care focused communication occurs across heart failure populations. Among adults with CHD, only 1% recalled discussing advance care planning with their medical team even though 78% of the participants believed their healthcare 
providers should initiate end of life decision making discussions early in the disease course.
45 
Only 37% of family members of adults who died of heart failure were aware of their loved one’s poor prognosis. Few were informed of the imminent death of their family member; as such, over 
1/3 of the patients died alone.
46 Communication about end of life care preferences occurs even 
less frequently among pediatric heart failure populations. Study PI [INVESTIGATOR_542998]. Initial data analysis of 82 respondents  suggests that providers rarely or never  discuss death/dying, advance care 
planning or prognosis with pediatric patients with heart failure/heart  transplant (ages 4 -24 
years). Respondents indicated a high level of discomfort in discussing these topi[INVESTIGATOR_542999]/parent(s)  being unaccepting of t he prognosis, the 
patient/parent(s)  having unrealistic expectations for treatment, and there being an unknown 
prognosis/disease trajectory. These barriers should not prevent us from addressing the end of 
life care needs of our AYA patients and families. Yet, the majority of AYAs with serious illnesses 
report feeling inadequately informed and insufficiently involved in their health care.
47,[ADDRESS_708671] that AYAs desire prognostic information early in their disease course. Many want to be made aware of their options and engage in shared decision making with caregivers.
49,50 Although the degree to which youth desire active participation in 
discussions about death and dying varies,  the majority of AYAs with life -threatening illnesses 
describe a preference to discuss their end of life care wishes – and to do so prior to becoming 
acutely unwell .[ADDRESS_708672]. Cousino (PI) and her study team ( HUM00157016 ), t his 
study will pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] a physician- directed communication focused intervention, WE CHATT. The 
development of WE CHATT was informed by [CONTACT_322007], with the ultimate 
goal of improving patient -centered communication for young people with advanced heart 
disease. The primary outcome of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_543000] , 
however, in the future, WE CHATT aims to (1) improve patient -centered communication with 
young people with advanced heart disease and (2) increase physician comfort in 
communicating with young people themselves regarding their communication needs and 
preferences.  
METHODS  
Page [ADDRESS_708673] 
anticipate remaining on staff >1 years. Study PI (Cousino) and Co -I (Schumacher)  will 
co-lead recruitment efforts via presentation(s) of study objectives and procedures at 
faculty/fellow meetings. Cardiology faculty and fellows were informally surveyed 
regarding interest in participating in the study. Over 90% of faculty and fellows expressed openness to participating in the study. Thus, the recruitment goal of 20 
physician participants is feasible.   
 
Patient/Caregivers . P
 atients (12- 24 years) with heart failure symptoms meeting criteria 
for [LOCATION_001] Heart Association (NYHA) Class II - IV heart failure will be eligible (i.e., 
limitations in physical activity, fatigue, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], dyspnea). One parent/caregiver of 
patient participants meeting inclusion criteria will also be eligible. This patient  age range 
was selected in accordance with research in other illness groups,48,49,51 is consistent with 
the World Health Organization’s definition of adolescent/young adult (AYA) , and fulfills 
the Institute of Medicine’s need for research on AYA end of life care preferences and 
decision making involvement.29 This age range also captures the average age (17 years) 
of patients  with congenital heart disease.38 A new patient  meeting the above criteria in 
any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6885] (inpatient, outpatient cardiology clinic, emergency room) being cared 
for by a participating physician will be eligible for the study. Patients with significant 
cognitive/developmental delay with potential to impact study participation will be 
excluded from the study due to the focus on physician- youth communication. Parents 
and parent/caregivers who are non- English speaking will be excluded from this pi[INVESTIGATOR_11480].  
 
Compensation for Time . I ntervention arm physician participants will receive a $[ADDRESS_708674] for their time to complete surveys, attend intervention training, and engage in 
intervention with patient participants. Control arm physician participants will receive a $[ADDRESS_708675] for their time completing surveys. All patient and parent/caregiver 
participants will receive a $[ADDRESS_708676] for their time completing surveys.  
 
Procedures  
 
Intervention Ar m. The WE CHATT communication- tool was developed based upon 
mixed -methods research and stakeholder engagement (patients, parents, physicians, 
nurses, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_187094]) led by [CONTACT_115158], [CONTACT_543002], over the past decade. It involves the collaborative completion of a 2 -page communication preferences document 
between a primary physician and an adolescent/young adult patient. Intervention arm physicians will participate in a 1- hour training led by [CONTACT_115158], [CONTACT_543002],  featuring 
didactic, multimedia, and exper iential -based learning to support their facilitation of the 
WE CHATT intervention with patients.   
 
Control  A
rm . Physicians randomized to the control arm will not receive training in the WE 
CHATT communication intervention. Usual/standard care will be provided.  
 
Page 4 of 4 
 Descriptive Measures.  A ll physician participants will be asked to complete a 
background/demographic questionnaire (e.g., age, years of practice, previous communication 
training). Baseline and post -intervention complet ion of  a previously used/published measure of 
physician comfort in communicating with patients and families, particularly around difficult topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102] (i.e., prognosis), will also be completed. Medical chart review will be completed to gather patient 
demographics and basic medical history, which will be used to define the study sample.  
 
Outcome Measures .  
 
Physician Measures . I ntervention- arm physician participants will complete an 
investigator -designed Likert -rating and open -ended question survey assessing 
intervention satisfaction, ease of  intervention administration/completion, time to complete 
WE CHATT  intervention with patient, barriers/feedback specific to WE CHATT, and 
knowledge gained/perceived impact on practice.   
 
Patient/Caregiver Measures . I ntervention- arm p atient and caregiver dyads will complete 
an investigator -designed Likert -rating and open- ended question survey assessing 
intervention satisfaction, ease of intervention administration/completion, time to complete 
WE CHATT intervention with physician, barriers/feedback specific to WE CHATT, and 
knowledge gained/perceived impact on their medical care . All participating  patients  and 
parents  will complete the self -administered 18-item Service Evaluation Questionnair e49 
as an assessment of healthcare satisfaction, which has been used in similarly aged 
samples.[ADDRESS_708677] in 
physician (PediTIPS) and perceived empathy (CARE measure)  will also be completed.  
 
 
Analysis Plan . Paired samples T- Test will be employed within the intervention arm  to compare 
mean physician comfort, mean patient/family satisfaction, mean trust in physician, and mean perceived empathy. ANCOVA will be used to examine group differences in physician comfort, 
patient/family satisfaction, trust in physician, and perceived empathy . Frequencies, percentages 
and means will be calculated to describe physician, patient and family  satisfaction with the WE 
CHATT intervention.  
 
 LIMITATIONS  
 
Non-English speaking participants will be excluded from Study 1, limiting examination of cultural 
influences on end of life care preferences.  Both physician fellows and attending physicians will 
be included as participants to ensure the recruitment goal of [ADDRESS_708678] 
included both fellows and attending physicians in their healthcare communication research.

Title: Negative Pressure Wound Therapy asaDrug Delivery System
Principal Investigator: [INVESTIGATOR_32672] A.Lavery, DPM, MPH
Sponsor: American Diabetes Association
1.Introduction andPurpose:
The aimofthisstudy istoimprove wound healing inhigh riskdiabetic patients thatrequire
surgical debridement oropen amputation foraninfected foot wound. The most common
reason forhospi[INVESTIGATOR_32673]. Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT) [1,2]hasdramatically changed the
outcomes ofcomplex wounds, especially inthediabetic foot.Compared tostandard
wound care, diabetic patients treated with NPWT are1.4times more likely toheal and2.5
times less likely torequire amputation [2-4].Our preliminary work suggests that using
irrigation with NPWT provides anadditional dramatic improvement inhealing compared to
“traditional NPWT”. NPWT with irrigation isanalogous tothebenefit ofdrug-eluting stents
compared tobare metal stents forcardiovascular disease [5,6].Irrigation increases the
effectiveness ofNPWT by[CONTACT_32705], accelerating wound healing, and
decreasing thecost ofwound treatment [7-11].Thus, thecombination ofNPWT and
irrigation solution could significantly improve clinical outcomes and reduce theeconomic
burden inthisseriously illpopulation.
Traditional Negative Pressure Wound Therapy delivers subatmospheric pressure toa
wound using afoam dressing that issealed with anocclusive dressing. The addition of
irrigation with antiseptic solution isdelivered tothesealed wound using additional tubing from
anIVbagattached totheNPWT device. Ourpreliminary data suggest thatwhen traditional
NPWT iscombined with antiseptic irrigation, there isahigher rate ofwound closure, fewer
surgeries, and shorter length ofhospi[INVESTIGATOR_32674]
(Preliminary Study 2).
Wepropose arandomized clinical study of151patients with infected, diabetic footwounds
that require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_32675]“conventional” NPWT with no
irrigation.
Aim 1:Compare clinical outcomes with Negative Pressure Wound Therapy with
irrigation and Negative Pressure Wound Therapy without irrigation. We expect that
patients treated with NPWT withirrigation willahave higher proportions ofwounds thatheal,
fewer surgeries, and faster wound healing trajectories when compared topatients treated
withtraditional NPWT without irrigation.
Aim 2:Compare quantitative cultures and clinical infections inpatients treated with
NPWT with irrigation compared toconventional NPWT. Wehypothesize that patients
Version 7.[ADDRESS_32055] asignificantly lower bacterial load, andfewer and
lesssevere clinical infections.
Aim 3:Compare health function and well-being ofpatients treated with NPWT with
irrigation compared toconventional NPWT. We hypothesize that patients treated with
NPWT and continuous irrigation willhave significantly higher indicators offunctional health
andwell-being ascompared withstandard NPWT.
2.Background:
There isaworldwide epi[INVESTIGATOR_32676]. According todata from theWorld Health
Organization, theworld prevalence ofdiabetes among adults was 6.4% in2010, affecting 285
million people worldwide. The prevalence ofdiabetes isexpected increase to7.7% by2030
(439 million adults).[ 12]The U.S. Centers forDisease Control andPrevention estimate that
26million people intheUShave diabetes.[ 13]Over thepast fiveyears inthe[LOCATION_002],
theprevalence ofdiabetes has increased 26% and thecost has increased 41% to$245
billion ayear [14,15].
Diabetic Foot Wounds and Amputations: Diabetic footwounds arecommon, complex and
costly.[ 16-18]One ofthemost frequent causes ofhospi[INVESTIGATOR_32677].[ 13]Inthe[LOCATION_002] in2007, approximately one-
quarter ofthetotal cost ofdiabetes treatment was spent onlower extremity complications
($43.5 billion). [19-21]Theincidence ofdiabetic footulcers inMedicare enrollees isabout 7%
[22,23],andapproximately 61% offootwounds become infected. Twenty -percent ofpatients
with infected foot wounds end upwith amputation ofthefoot orleg.[16]The incidence of
lower extremity amputation is0.5-1.0% (90,000 peryear). The annual mortality rate for
diabetics with foot ulcers isabout 11%, and after alower extremity amputation, mortality is
nearly 22%.[ 14,24-32][17,33-39]
Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT) hasdramatically changed thecare ofcomplex
diabetic footwounds. Compared tostandard wound care, patients treated with NPWT are1.4
times more likely toheal and2.5times less likely torequire amputation.[ 40][2-4]
NPWT isused extensively totreat infected wounds. Experimental studies inpi[INVESTIGATOR_32678] 108to106colony forming units with
NPWT [41,42]However inclinical trials “traditional NPWT” hasnotbeen shown toreduce the
riskofinfection. Forinstance, Armstrong andLavery reported that16.9% ofNPWT patients
were treated forinfection compared to9.4% ofpatients thatreceived “standard ofcare” ina
randomized clinical trial(RCT) ofdiabetic foot wounds. The addition ofantiseptic irrigation
provides asignificant reduction inbacterial load compared to“traditional NPWT”
(Preliminary Work: Study 2).Weexpect itwilltranslate intofewer clinical infections [11],
fewer surgeries andfaster wound healing.
SIGNIFICANCE OFNEW INTERVENTION We willuse NPWT with irrigation asadrug
delivery system. This application isanalogous tothebenefit ofdrug-eluting stents compared
tobare metal stents forcardiovascular disease [5,6].We believe delivering topi[INVESTIGATOR_32679], reduce infections and
reduce amputations. Our preliminary work hasshown that irrigation reduces bacterial load
significantly more than NPWT alone (Preliminary Work: Study 3)[11].Inaddition ahigher
Version 7.0 1.25.18
Page 3of20proportion ofpatients treated with NPWT andirrigation had their wounds surgically closed,
required fewer surgeries, andshorter hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] (Preliminary Work: Study 2).
Irrigation Solution Selection: There aremany potential irrigation products todecrease
bacteria inwounds. Povidone iodine, Dakin’s solution, silver nitrate, and polyhexanide are
effective toeliminate bacteria. However, some ofthese have been shown todamage
fibroblasts andarethought toimpede healing. Irrigation with Polyhexanide solution (PHMB)
seems tobethebest choice totreat infected diabetic foot wounds because itisavery
effective antiseptic, and itpromotes wound healing. Polyhexanide, marketed under the
names Prontosan andLavasept, ispolyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB). Itisastrong base
and interacts with acidic phospholipi[INVESTIGATOR_32680], leading toincreased
permeability andcelldeath.[ 43]PHMB hasabroad antimicrobial spectrum, including Gram -
positive and Gram -negative bacteria, and biofilm -forming organisms.[ 44]A>5log10
reduction after 5minutes ofapplication isachieved with 0.02% polyhexanide against S.
aureus, E.coli,E.faecium, P.aeruginosa andC.albicans. [45]
Polyhexanide Improves Wound Healing: Several studies indicate thatPHMB solution and
gelimprove wound healing. Kramer [47]compared PHMB and octenidine and Ringer’s
lactate solution insuperficial 20mmdiameter wounds inpi[INVESTIGATOR_14107] (n=108 wounds). There were no
differences inhistology ortissue compatibility inthetreatment groups. There was faster
wound healing inPHMB animals compared totheother treatments (PMHB 22.9 vs.Ringers
24.1 andoctemidine 28.3 days, p<0.05). Schmit -Neuerburg conducted adouble -blinded RCT
incontaminated wounds and compared 0.2% PHMB (n=45) and Ringers lactate solution
(n=35). The PHMB group had better wound healing and faster reduction ofGram positive
infections.[ 46]Valenzuela [48]evaluated PHMB inaRCT inchronic wounds (n=142). They
compared “standard ofcare” to0.1% PHMB gel.Patients inthePHMB groups demonstrated
reversal ofpositive cultures (p=0.004), decreased surface area (p=0.013), and increased
granulated tissue (p=0.001) compared tostandard ofcare treatments.
Polyhexanide Irrigation with NPWT :Several retrospective studies have used Polyhexanide
irrigation with NPWT compared topatients treated standard wound care.[7-10]Timmers
reported theresults ofaretrospective study of30patients with osteomyelitis ofthepelvis or
lower extremity that received NPWT with PHMB irrigation compared to90patients that
received standard ofcare. The PHMB irrigation subjects hadfewer recurrent infection (10%
vs.59%, p<0.001), Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408] 36(15-75)vs.73days (6-149) p<0.001), andfewer surgical
procedures 2(range: 1-4)vs. 5 (range: 2-42)p<0.001.
INNOVATIONS:
1.NPWT asadrug delivery system. NPWT hasdramatically changed wound care inthe
last10years. Ourinitial focus istodeliver antiseptic solution tothewound bedtoreduce the
bacterial load andaccelerate wound healing. Inthefuture, weplan tousethesame approach
todeliver growth factors andanti-inflammatory medications towounds. Ourpreliminary data
suggests that when “traditional” NPWT iscombined with irrigation, there isasynergistic
effect. Ahigher proportion ofwounds areclosed with fewer surgeries intheoperating room
and shorter hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7959]. This isthefirst Clinical Effectiveness Research study that
compares clinical andeconomic outcomes with NPWT andNPWT with irrigation. This isthe
firstNPWT RCT ininfected diabetic wounds. Figure 2,above shows simultaneous irrigation
with NPWT. Irrigation solution isdirected tothewound through IVtubing. Itflows across the
Version 7.[ADDRESS_32056] ofNPWT and NPWT with continuous irrigation onserial
quantitative bacterial cultures and clinical infections: This isthefirststudy toevaluate
serial tissue cultures ininfected diabetic footwounds toevaluate (1)theeffect ofNPWT on
bacterial load and (2)therole ofbacterial load onwound healing. Our results may help
redefine “infection” asitpertains towound healing inpersons with diabetes andasapi[INVESTIGATOR_32681].
3.Selection Bias: Industry sponsored research routinely excludes high-riskpatients with
significant PAD, poor glucose control and co-morbidities, even though the excluded
population isoften thepopulation that needs advanced wound therapi[INVESTIGATOR_32682]. The
industry sponsored RCTs previously referenced systematically excluded high-risk patients
with moderate peripheral artery disease (PAD) (ABI <0.70), glycated hemoglobin >10%,
active infection, andendstage renal disease requiring dialysis [49].
4.Dropouts: Dropouts arecommon inwound studies (20-35%) and arecategorized as
failures inintent -to-treat studies. With their consent, wewillcontinue tofollow patients that
elect todrop outorwhose physicians believe itisintheir best interest tostop participation.
Wewillcontinue toseethem andevaluate their wound anddocument anyadverse events.
Toourknowledge, nostudies inthewound healing literature have been designed tofollow
subjects that elect todrop out.Wewilldocument their treatments, butnoprotocol -specific
treatments willbeprovided once they withdraw from theactive treatment phase. This will
allow ustoestimate adherence effectiveness, aswellasintent -to-treat.
C.PRELIMINARY DATA
Preliminary Studies: Drs. Lavery’s team hascompleted several NPWT studies [3,26,34,
40,50-54]tosupport thisresearch. They have used investigator initiated, industry funding
from KCI, ITI,Convatec, Smith Nephew andThermotek toexecute preliminary animal and
human studies togather preliminary NPWT data.
OurPreliminary Work with NPWT indicates:
1.NPWT patients have ahigher proportion ofwounds thatheal compared to“standard
wound care” [1,4,53].(Preliminary Work: Study 1)
2.NPWT is lessexpensive than “standard wound care” indiabetic footwounds [54].
3.NPWT with irrigation provides ahigher proportion ofwound closure, fewer surgeries
and shorter length ofhospi[INVESTIGATOR_32683]. (Preliminary Work:
Study 2)
4.NPWT with irrigation with polyhexanide biguanide (PHMB) significantly reduces
Pseudomonas aeruginosa compared to“traditional NPWT” inaswine model.
(Preliminary Work: Study 3)
5.There isnodifference inwound healing indiabetic footwounds treated with high (125
mmHg)andlow (75mm Hg)continuous pressure. (Preliminary Work: Study 4)

This study demonstrated that NPWT issuperior to“standard wound care” toheal complex
diabetic foot wounds. Weenrolled 162 patients into a16-week, randomized clinical trial.
Inclusion criteria consisted ofdiabetic patients with partial footamputation wounds. Patients
were randomly assigned toNPWT (n=77) orstandard moist wound care (n=85). Thetreating
physician had discretion regarding thelevel (80-200 mm Hg) and mode ofpressure
(continuous orintermittent). More patients healed intheNPWT group than inthecontrol
group
56% vs.39%, p=0.04). Recurrent infection was higher intheNPWT group (NPWT 16.9%
9.4%), butthedifference wasnotstatistically significant.
Kaplan Meier Analysis: The survival analysis shows asignificant difference inthetime to
healing. Themedian time towound closure was 59days forpatients intheNPWT group and
106days forcontrols.
Study 2:The Impact ofNegative Pressure Wound Therapy with Instillation Compared
toNegative Pressure Wound Therapy. Plast Reconstr Surg 2013 This study shows that
NPWT with twodifferent doses ofProntosan irrigation solution decreases thenumber of
surgeries, length ofhospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], andincreases theproportion ofwounds that areclosed
compared to“traditional NPWT”. Weconducted aretrospective study ofhospi[INVESTIGATOR_32684] (n=74), NPWT
with irrigation with polyhexanide biguanide (PHMB) for6minutes every hour (n=34), and
NPWT with irrigation with polyhexanide biguanide (PHMB) for20minutes every hour (n=34).
The proportion ofwounds that were surgically closed was significantly higher, and the
number ofsurgeries was significantly less inpatients thatreceived NPWT with 6minutes of
irrigation compared tostandard NPWT without irrigation. Similar trends were seen with
NPWT with 20 minutes ofirrigation.Control VACSurvival Distribution Function Estimate

HiStudy 3:Simultaneous irrigation and negative pressure wound therapy enhances
wound healing and reduces wound bioburden inaporcine model. Wound Repair
Regen 2013. The objective ofthestudy was tocompare wound healing and reduction in
pseudomonas onacute wound using aswine model. Weevaluated sixwound treatments (1.)
control wound (2.)NPWT 125 mmHgcontinuous pressure with foam interface (3.)NPWT
with lowvolume irrigation (15cc/hr) with Saline (4.)NPWT with lowvolume irrigation (15
cc/hr) with 1%polyhexanide biguanide (PHMB) (5)NPWT with high volume irrigation (40
cc/hr) with Saline (6)NPWT with high volume irrigation (40cc/hr) with 1%PHMB. Each
wound was inoculated with ~[ADDRESS_32057] inoculation, dressings were
removed; wounds were treated for21
days with dressing changes twice a
week. With Control treatment,
Pseudomonas aeruginosa bioburden
increased ~5x107over the 21-day
time course. This proliferation was
substantially reduced with the
application ofNPWT orNPWT with
irrigation, except forlow flow rate
treatment with saline (p=0.068). There was asignificant and sustained reduction inwound
area reduction inNPWT wounds compared tocontrol wounds over theduration ofthestudy
(p<0.05). There was nodifference inwound area reduction among theNPWT and NPWT
withirrigation groups inhealthy young pi[INVESTIGATOR_14107].

reduction isthesame inpatients treated with high (125 mmhg)andlow(75mmHg)NPWT.
Weevaluated 40patients ina4-week RCT. This study compared alowpressure NPWT
device using 75mm Hgcontinuous pressure with asilicone coated gauze interface
(Convatec, NJ)andthe“standard ofcare approach” using 125mmHgcontinuous pressure
withasponge interface (KCI SanAntonio, TX). There wasnodifference inthepercent wound
volume reduction at4weeks (87% vs.92%),ortheproportion ofwounds with complete
closure (50% for75mmHgvs.60% for125mmHg). Wound closure wasachieved with split
thickness skin grafts, rotational flaps ordelayed primary closure. Nowounds healed by

Theprincipal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_32698], including:
·Study accrual rate
·Experience ofstudy participants
·Study attrition including participant withdrawals/dropouts
·Patterns ofAEs and/or unanticipated events
·Patterns ofprotocol deviations and/or violations
·Changes inrisk/benefit
Wewillalso employ astudy monitoring committee which willinclude Drs. LaFontaine and
Lavery, aswellasourteam statistician andstudy coordinator. Weplan tomeet once amonth
todiscuss theprogress ofthestudy. We will also install a data safety monitoring
board t o review the data of the study on an annual basis. Wewillalso use this
forum todiscuss specific issues anddecisions thatmay arise during theimplementation of
thestudy.
12..Procedures toMaintain Confidentiality:
Allstudy visits andprocedures willbeconducted inthepatient's room atParkland Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_32699] .
Version 7.[ADDRESS_32067] copy data (source files) willbekept separately inthelocked coordinator's office. The
linkbetween thesubject's name [CONTACT_32711] -protected
computer filewithaccess limited tomembers oftheresearch team.
Electronic data willbepassword protected withaccess limited tomembers oftheresearch
team inthedepartmental 'R'drive.
Noidentified data willleave thecampus.
13.Potential Benefits:
There may ormay notbedirect benefits tothesubject from participation inthisresearch.
Quantum™ NPWT orQuantum™ NPWT withIrrigation may help toheal thewound, butthis
cannot beguaranteed.
However, results ofthisresearch may contribute new information thatwillhelp andbenefit
other people who have surgically debrided wounds inthefuture. Information gained from this
research could lead tobetter treatment.
14.Biostatistics:
Sample Size: Inapreliminary study, theproportion ofsubjects with closed wound was 62%
using traditional NPWT and94% using NPWT with irrigation (Preliminary Work: Study 3).
Forthesample size, weused amore conservative estimate ofwound closure andestimated
80% wound closure with NPWT with irrigation. Using atwo-sided Chi-square with alpha of
1.5 and80% power anda20% drop outrate, asample size of70subjects pergroup (total
of151)isrequired with 62% healing inNPWT group and 80% intheNPWT with irrigation
treatment group.
Analysis Plan: Wewillexamine thedescriptive statistics, frequency distribution andgraphic
plots ofeach variable todetect thedata errors, outlying values, number and pattern of
missing data andnormality ofdistributions. The natural logtransformation willbeapplied to
variables which arehighly skewed. Baseline characteristics ofstudy population willbe
presented asmeans (standard deviation) forcontinuous variables with normal distribution,
median (inter -quartile ranges) forcontinuous variables with high skewed distribution or
proportion forcategorical variables according tothetreatment groups. The difference in
means between treatment groups willbecompared using the two-sample t-test. The
difference indistribution willbecompared using Wilcoxon rank-sum test. The difference in
percentage treatment groups willbecompared using theChi-square test.
Study Population:
·Intention -to-Treat (ITT) Population: TheITTpopulation willinclude allrandomized
subjects who atleast received onetreatment andhadatleast onepost-baseline
efficacy assessment. TheITTpopulation willbeused fortheprimary efficacy
analysis.
Version 7.0 1.25.18
Page 16of20·PerProtocol Population (PP): ThePPpopulation willconsist ofsubjects intheITT
population who didnothave major protocol violations. The review ofprotocol
violations willbeperformed andsigned offprior tostudy database lock and
unblinding. The primary efficacy analysis andsecondary analyses willbeconducted
onthePPpopulation aspartofasensitivity analysis.
·Safety Population: TheSafety population willinclude allsubjects who received
treatment. Thesafety population willbeused forthesafety analysis.
Missing Data Imputation: Fortheprimary outcomes with ITTanalysis, wewillusemultiple
imputation procedure toimpute themissing data. Thesensitivity analysis willbeperformed to
evaluate theeffect ofassumption ofimputation. Forthesecondary outcomes and safety
analysis, missing data willnotbeimputed.
Multiplicity: Stepwise Holm’s testwillbeused toadjust forthemultiple comparisons.

 Page 8 of 43  3.0 Study Design Summary  
This study was designed to satis fy both the FDA SMBG:2016 and the  ISO [ZIP_CODE]:2013, Section 
8 requirements.  Besides different analysis criteria, the main difference between these regulations 
is that FDA SMBG:2016 requires that both naïve users (people without diabetes) and pe ople with 
diabetes are included in the study population.  The ISO [ZIP_CODE]:[ADDRESS_1032899] states that the study 
population shall be pe ople with diabetes.  
The study will be conducted at two clinical sites and enroll a total of approximately 370 lay users. 
Ten to fifteen per cent (10 -  15%) of the enrolled subjects will be pe ople without diabetes and the 
remaining subjects will be pe ople with diabetes.   
For this study, there must be at least [ADDRESS_1032900] results for each BGMS, CONTOUR  NEXT and CONTOUR  
TV3.  In addition, per FDA SMBG:2016, at least 10 unaltered fingerstick blood samples will be < 
80 mg/dL and 10 will be > 250 mg/dL.  Subject enrollment will continue until the required 
evaluable samples are collected.   
Sites are not required to replace subjects with diabetes who did not have evaluable venous blood 
results.  
The subjects will be [ADDRESS_1032901] been trained on all aspects of the protocol, forms, the use of the CONTOUR  NEXT and 
CONTOUR  TV3 systems, data collection,  and GCP.   
All subjects will complete the informed consent process before performing any study procedures.   
Procedures -  All Subjects  
According to a randomization schedule, subjects will be assigned to: 1) use either the CONTOUR  
NEXT or CONTOUR  TV3 meter first, and 2) use one of three test strip lots corresponding to each 
meter throughout the visit.   
The untrained subjects, who have never used either of the systems previously, will be sequestered 
in such a way that they cannot observe or be influenced by [CONTACT_754629].  They will learn to use the assigned meter by [CONTACT_512472] 
(UG) and Quick Reference Guide (QRG).  Each subject will perform one fingerstick self -test using 
a Microlet NEXT or similar lancing device and the assigned meter.  Immediately following the 
subject self -test, a Tenderlett ™ or similar device will be used by [CONTACT_127004]’s 
finger (same hand) to collect a capi[INVESTIGATOR_512466].   
Immediately following the Tenderlett lancing, subjects will lance their palm using the Microlet 
NEXT lancing device (with AST clear  endcap) and will perform a self -test using the meter.   
Immediately following the AST test, the staff person will perform a fingerstick test on the subject. All subject self -test results and study staff results will be compared to YSI results from blood 
obtained from the Tenderlett fingerstick.  
Hematocrit will be measured for all subjects.    
All Subjects will then complete a questionnaire (Questionnaire 1) to provide feedback on the meter 
system and instructions for use (UG and QRG).   
Clinical Trial Protocol GCA -PRO -2018- 006-[ADDRESS_1032902] is enrolled (i.e. completed informed consent and passed inclusion/exclusion criteria). 
After all testing is completed, staff will demonstrate to the subjects with diabetes several features 
of the met er system that would not necessarily be experienced during the brief accuracy testing. 
These subjects will be given a second questionnaire (Questionnaire 2) to provide feedback about the new features of the system.   
 
Procedures repeated with second BGMS  
After completing study procedures for one BGMS, subjects will then repeat all of these procedures 
using the second BGMS, except the hematocrit and venipuncture procedures.  (Hematocrit is 
measured on a separate instrument and is not meter -specific; venipunc ture is performed once and 
measured on both meters, as previously described.)  
4.[ADDRESS_1032903] Recruitment, Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria  
Subject Recruitment:   At least 370 subjects will be enrolled into the study.  These will be people

as a backup in case the first tube is not measureable (i.e., tube spun out, broken tube, clay seal compromised, etc.) .  Subject hematocrit measurement should be within 0 -70% in order for the 
subject BG results to be considered evaluable.  
Note:  Microhematocrit tubes with  anticoagulant will be used for capi[INVESTIGATOR_512467]. 
Additional details regarding hematocrit measurements are found in Appendix C.  
 
5.12 YSI Glucose Analyzer   
5.12.1 YSI Analyzer Operation and Control Tests  
The YSI Glucose Analyzer will be maintained and operated according to the instr uctions in the 
manufacturer’s operating manual.   
Clinical Trial Protocol GCA -PRO -2018- 006-[ADDRESS_1032939] been assayed by a method traceable to one proposed 
for use as a national glucose reference method developed through the combined efforts of the Center for Disease Control, the National Bureau of Standards, the American Association for Clinical C hemistry, and the FDA will be provided by [CONTACT_127010]
4.  These controls will be run for pre -study and daily control tests, and 
will be within the lower and upper limits of the target levels noted in Table 5.1.   The procedure for proper thawing and handling of the serum controls is found in Attachment 1.

5.12.2 Pre Study and Daily Control Tests  
These four glucose control sera will be used to verify the accuracy of each YSI analyzer before the study begins (Pre -study testing).  Six  (6) pre -study runs will be performed on each YSI that will 
be used in the trial : 2 runs per day  for 3 days .  The Ascensia Study Manager or designee will review 
the YSI pre -study glucose control data before the study begins.  
The daily controls  will be tested: 1 sip = [ADDRESS_1032940] blood samples will be monitored by [CONTACT_127011] 4 
glucose control s at the beginning of the day .  The YSI will be calibrated before each serum control 
sample is tested.   The sequence of testing will be:  
1. Calibrate the YSI  
2. Test Control 2 (1 sip)  
3. Calibrate  
4. Test C ontrol 3 (1 sip)  
5. Calibrate  
6. Test Control 4 (1 sip)  
7. Calibrate  
8. Test Control 5 (1 sip)

 Page 19 of 43  Site staf f will keep a maintenance log for each YSI, including daily operational checks, 
maintenance and membrane changes.   A full set of serum controls should also be tested after YSI 
parts are changed (such as buffers, probes, or membranes).    
5.12.[ADDRESS_1032942] plasma samples (capi[INVESTIGATOR_126983]) will be tested using [ADDRESS_1032943] (=2 results, 1 
from white and 1 from black probe) with calibration of the YSI before the first sip.  A serum control (1 sip) will be tested after each subject plasma sample to verify the YSI Analyzer has remained in control during the plasma sample test.  The control with target value close to the concentration of the subject plasma sample will be tested.  The average of the black and white probe results wi ll be verified to be within the ranges shown in Table 5.1.  
If the control result is out of range, the YSI will be recalibrated and the control sample will be retested.  If the control result is now within the appropriate range (Table 5.1), the control sam ple 
is conf irmed as appropriate for use.  The YSI analyzer will then be re- calibrated, the plasma will 
be re- tested, and the control will be tested per the protocol’s plasma testing procedure already 
described.  
If the control result is not within the appr opriate range after the plasma sample has been tested 
twice, the results for this subject sample will be non -evaluable.  
The sequence of testing for each subject sample will be:  
1. Calibrate the YSI  
2. Test plasma sample (1 sip)  
3. Test control (1 sip)  
4. Verify control result (mean of black and white probe results)  is within limits in Table 
5.1.  If it is, stop and record result. 
5. If not, repeat Steps 1, [ADDRESS_1032944] sample are non -evaluable.  
Glucose values of the YSI replicates (both controls and plasma) should be within 4 mg/dL or 4% 
of each other (i.e. 4 mg/dL  for values < 100 mg/dL and 4% for values ≥ 100 mg/dL).  If they are 
not, an additional assay should be run.  
 
5.12.4 Recording YSI Results  
The YSI source documents will be labeled as follows throughout the study to facilitate matching glucose results on the sour ce document with results recorded on the CRF:  
Sample identification will include: 
1) Ascensia serum traceability control level or  
2) Subject ID plus either ‘capi[INVESTIGATOR_1396]’ or ‘venous’ blood 
NOTE:  If glucose results are not to be used due to operator errors, insufficient sample, etc., this should be clearly marked on the YSI source document. 
The YSI operator or designee will label all samples on YSI tape and record YSI results for all 
plasma and control sample runs on the appropriate source documents.  
Clinical Trial Protocol GCA -PRO -2018- 006-[ADDRESS_1032945] all non- numeric codes -  QNS (Quantity not sufficient), NO (Not 
Obtainable), and error codes as appropriate for the YSI tests.  
 
5.[ADDRESS_1032946] Questionnaires  
Site staff will administer two questionnaires to subjects.  Questionnaire 1 will be given to all 
subjects and Questionnaire 2 will be given only to subjects with diabetes.  
5.13.1 Questionnaire 1: Evaluation of Instructions for Use.  (All subjects)  
Staff will administer a questionnaire to all subjects who perform fingerstick self -testing after the 
individual meter testing is completed.   
The questionnaire will include statements for which a numerical score or rating will be provided 
by [CONTACT_1766] (1=strongly disagree, 2=disagree, 3=neutral, 4=agree, 5=strongly agree).  These 
numerically scored statements will be tabulated into frequency distributions.   The following 
statements will be subject to the pass/fail criteria listed in the study objectives section: 
• I find it easy to do a fingerstick blood test with this meter.  
• The meter display is easy to see and read.  
• It was easy to understand my test results.  
• The instructions (User Guide and Quick Reference Guide) were easy to understand.  
• The instructions clearly explain how to run a test. 
• The instructions clearly explain what to do if an error message  is displayed by [CONTACT_127012].    Note: an error message will be demonstrated by [CONTACT_127013]/her testing. 
Per ISO [ZIP_CODE]:2013, Section 8.8.2, t he questionnaire will also contain a section whereb y the 
subject can provide unrestricted comments on their ex perience about using the BGMS.  This 
questionnaire will be administered by [CONTACT_127015]’s responses.  The subject 
will be given an example questionnaire to assist with providing the responses.  
5.13.2 Questionnaire 2: BGMS Features.  (Only subjects with diabetes)  
After all testing and the first questionnaire ha ve been completed, the study staff will demonstrate 
to only the subjects with diabetes several features of the BGMS  that would not necessarily be 
experienced during the brief accuracy testing.  This will ensure that the subjects are able to 
understand the features, and answer questions in the questionnaire.  
There are no acceptance criteria for this questionnaire.  This questionnaire may be 1) administered 
by [CONTACT_127015]’s responses or 2) completed by [CONTACT_127016], as per site procedures.   In the first scenario, the subject will be giv en an example 
questionnaire to assist with providing the responses. 
5.[ADDRESS_1032947] BGMS randomly -assigned to them, subjects will 
then repeat all of these procedures using the second BGMS, except the hematocrit and venipuncture procedures.   (Hematocrit is measured on a separate instrument and is not meter -

Therefore, for BGMS 2, subjects will complete a  fingerstick test; a YSI sample will be collected 
by a Tenderlett stick from subject; subject will complete a palm AST; study staff will perform a 
fingerstick test from the subject; study staff will administer Questionnaire 1; and, if the subject has diabe tes, study staff will administer Questionnaire 2.

people with diabetes or other diseases or conditions. 
7.0  Adverse Event Management and Medical Device Reporting   
The procedures to be performed under this protocol are considered to be low risk. 
7.1 Description and Classification  
7.1.1. An AE during a clinical evaluation is “any untoward medical occurrence, unintended 
disease or injury, or untoward clinical signs (including abnormal laboratory findings) in subjects, 
users or other persons, whether or not related to the investigational medi cal device.”  It is not 
dependent on whether the event is considered to be related to the investigational product or the study.  An AE includes events not seen at the beginning of the study, or worsened if present at the beginning.  Adverse events can be classified as presented in Table 7.1.  
7.1.2. The next classification to consider is whether or not the AE is Anticipated or Unanticipated.  
In order for an AE to be considered ‘anticipated’ it must be listed in the protocol and ICF prior to any occurrence.  
7.1.3. For studies on products that have not yet been cleared for market, it is important that all 
AEs be documented and included in the study file.  
7.1.4. An unanticipated adverse device effect (UADE) is:  Any serious adverse effect on health 
or safety or  any life -threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with a device, if that 
effect, problem or death was not previously identified in nature, severity or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety or welfare of subjects [21CFR812.3(s)]. 
7.1.5. All AEs observed by [CONTACT_127018] (including all symptoms) and included in the study file.  
Clinical Trial Protocol GCA -PRO -2018- 006-[ADDRESS_1032960] has a hypogly cemic event, as determined by [CONTACT_079] 
(PI) during a study visit, the subject will be treated by [CONTACT_127019] . Appendices D and 
E note  each site’s treatment plan .  
Classification of the hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic event is at the discretion of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_126985].  If the hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic event is considered by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_126986], it will be considered to be an anticipated AE and will be recorded on the AE Form.  
Subjects who are hypo-  or hyperglycemic may continue with fingerstick testing if they so choose, 
and if the PI [INVESTIGATOR_126987].  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_126988] a hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic state.  
 
Table 7.1: Classification of Adv erse Event  
Serious*  Non-Serious  
An adverse event that leads to:  
a) death;  
b)  a serious deterioration in health of the subject that,  
1) resulted in a life -threatening illness or 
injury,  
2) resulted in a permanent impairment of a 
body structure or a body function,  
3) required in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8448],  
4) resulted in medical or surgical intervention 
to prevent permanent impairment to body 
structure or a body function;  
c) fetal distress or a congenital abnormality or birth 
defect.  
May be anticipated or unanticipated.

devices for human subjects – Good Clinical Practice  All adverse events not reported as ser ious.  At each visit, all adverse 
events observed by [CONTACT_32595]/designate or reported by [CONTACT_127020].   
A non -serious adverse event is further classified with respect to severity 
and relationship to the trial product.  A non -serious adverse event may 
be anticipated or unanticipated.  
Further classification with regard to severity  
• Mild : Transient symptoms, easily tolerated, no interference with 
subjects daily activities.  
• Moderate:  Marked symptoms, moderate interference with 
subjects daily activities, and tolerable.  
• Severe:  Considerable interference with subject’s daily activities, 
not tolerable.  
Relationship to trial product: 
• Definitely Related: Causal relationship has been established  and documented 
• Probably Related: Good reasons and sufficient documentation to assume causal relationship have been established  
• Possibly Related: Causal relationship is likely and cannot be excluded  
• Probably Not Related: Good reasons and sufficient documentation not established to assume causal relationship  
• Not Related: The event is most likely related to an etiology other than the trial treatment

by [CONTACT_127024]/designee prior to the study.  The Study Manager or designee will conduct a 
study initiation visit, at least 1 monitoring  visit, and a close -out visit.   Note: the latter two visits 
may occur within a continuous timeframe.  
Ascensia representatives may observe some subject visits as part of study monitoring.  This will 
be done under supervision of the investigator.  Ascensia representatives will maintain subject 
confidentiality and will not interfere with rights of human subjects, sa fety or bias study conduct.  
9.6 Investigator’s Report of Study Closure  
Ascensia representatives will send a letter to the site informing them that the study is closed.  The 
study will be considered closed when the data has been locked for data analysis.  
The Investigator or designee will submit a report summarizing subject disposition and other study details, as appropriate, to the Ascensia Study Manager and the reviewing IRB.  This report will be completed within 3 months of the study closure date.  
 
In addit ion, the Ascensia Study Manager, or designee, will report the completion of the study to 
the IRB within 6 months of study closure.  
9.7 Registration of Trial  
The clinical trial will be registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov as required.  
9.8 Clinical Study Reports (CSR)  
Four CSRs will be written by [CONTACT_456].  Two CSRs will be written for CONTOUR NEXT: one report will evaluate data according to ISO [ZIP_CODE]:2013 criteria and one report according to FDA SMBG:2016 criteria.  Two CSRs will be written for CONTOUR TV3: one repo rt will evaluate 
data according to ISO [ZIP_CODE]:2013 criteria and one report according to FDA SMBG:[ADDRESS_1032970] IDs, will be kept by [CONTACT_512478].  The Investigator will retain all signed IC documents.  
Clinical data will be primarily collected through an EDC system used by [CONTACT_127007].  Study da ta 
will be recorded on forms that will serve as source documents for the EDC system.  These original Forms will be retained by [CONTACT_779].  
In addition to data collection, the EDC system will be used for data cleaning as well as monitoring operations.  Site a nd sponsor users will be trained on the system prior to the study start, and their 
access to EDC system will be contingent upon successful completion of training requirements. Study personnel will complete and sign all appropriate source document forms in compliance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP).  Source documents (Forms) should be completed legibly, in black 
or blue ink.  If it is necessary to make corrections, a single line should be drawn through the original 
entry, the new entry written in, and the correction initialed and dated by [CONTACT_114654]. 
Clinical Trial Protocol GCA -PRO -2018- 006-[ADDRESS_1032971] . 
YSI source documents (tapes) will be photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_126989].  Site staff or designees who photocopy the YSI tapes will certify (with signature, date, and YSI ID) 
that the copy is a true and accurate representation of the o riginal.  
11.0 Data Analysis 
The following analyses apply to both CONTOUR NEXT  and CONTOUR TV3 meters, with 
analyses for each meter independent of the other.  
 
11.1 Accuracy Objectives  
Primary Objective – Accuracy with All Subjects Included  
Let MeterBG  = meter blood glucose result;  
LabBG = laboratory method (YSI) comparator blood glucose result.  
 
For the primary accuracy objective, a result (MeterBG) is considered accurate if:  
|RD| = 100*|MeterBG – LabBG| / LabBG ≤ 15%, regardless of the value of LabBG.  
With n = 350 evaluable results, Xc  = 333 results would be required to satisfy the accuracy criteria.  
At P 0 = 96.65%, there is approximately a 95% chance of satisfying the primary objective.  
Conversely, at P a = 92.81%, there is approximately a 95% chance  of failing to satisfy this accuracy 
objective.  
In addition to the ±15% accuracy definition, at least 99% of the n = [ADDRESS_1032972] 
satisfy:  
|RD| = 100*|MeterBG – LabBG| / LabBG ≤ 20%, regardless of the value of LabBG.  
 
Thus at least 347 out of n = [ADDRESS_1032973] satisfy the ±20% accuracy definition.   
With n = 350 evaluable results, Xc = 347 results would be required to satisfy the accuracy criteria.  
At P 0 = 99.61%, there is approximately a 95% chance of satisfying this objective.  Conversely, at 
Pa = 97.80%, there is approximately a 95% chance of failing  to satisfy this accuracy objective.  
Secondary Objectives   
Assume 315 evaluable results from people with diabetes.  The ISO [ZIP_CODE]:2013 acceptance 
criterion is that 95% of those evaluable results must satisfy the accuracy criteria:  
|D| = |MeterBG – LabBG | ≤ 15 mg/dL, for LabBG < 100 mg/dL  
or 
|RD| = 100*|MeterBG – LabBG| / LabBG ≤ 15%, for LabBG ≥ 100 mg/dL. 
Clinical Trial Protocol GCA -PRO -2018- 006-[ADDRESS_1032974] DDC5P -[ZIP_CODE]   CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 Page 29 of 43  With n = 315, Xc = 300 results would be required to satisfy the accuracy criteria.  At P 0 = 96.79%, 
there is approximately a 95% chance of satisfying the primary objective.  Conversely, at P a = 
92.77%, there is approximately a 95% chance of failing to satisfy this objective. 
 
Secondary Objective – Internal Requirements  
1.  ±10.5% or ±10.5mg/dL  (CONTOUR  NEXT ) 
The hypothesis:  
H0: Pr{|RD| ≤ 10.5% when YSI ≥ 100mg/dL or |D| ≤ 10.5mg/dL when YSI < 100mg/dL} < 0.[ADDRESS_1032975] the alternative:  
H1: Pr{|RD| ≤ 10.5% when YSI ≥ 100mg/dL or |D| ≤ 10.5mg/dL when YSI < 100mg/dL} ≥ 0.95  
 With n = 315, the critical number of “successes” is Xc = 294.  That is, at least 294 out of n = [ADDRESS_1032976] satisfy the requirement: 
|RD| ≤ 1 0.5% when YSI ≥ 100mg/dL or |D| ≤ 10.5mg/dL when YSI < 100mg/dL  
 This acceptance criterion (cr itical value) gives about a 92.62% chance of rejecting H
0 in favor of 
H1 if the actual probability of “success” is 0.95.  
 
2.  ±12.5% or ±1 2.5mg/dL  (CONTOUR  TV3)  
 
The hypothesis:  
H0: Pr{|RD| ≤ 12.5% when YSI ≥ 100mg/dL or |D| ≤ 12.5mg/dL  when YSI < 100mg/dL} < 0.[ADDRESS_1032977] the alternative:  
H1: Pr{|RD| ≤ 12.5% when YSI ≥ 100mg/dL or |D| ≤ 12.5mg/dL when YSI < 100mg/dL} ≥ 0.95  
 With n = 315, the critical number of “successes” is Xc = 294.  That is, at least 294 out of n = [ADDRESS_1032978] satisfy the requirement: 
|RD| ≤ 1 2.5% when YSI ≥ 100mg/dL or |D| ≤ 12.5mg/dL when YSI < 100mg/dL  
 This acceptance criterion (critical value) gives about a 9 2.62% chance of rejecting H
0 in favor of 
H1 if the actual probability of “success” is 0.95.  
 3.  Study Staff Test

Two tests of the hypotheses will be performed.  
 
The hypothesis:  
H0: Pr{|RD| ≤ 15% when YSI ≥ 100mg/dL or |D| ≤ 15mg/dL when YSI < 100mg/dL} < 0.[ADDRESS_1032980] the alternative:  
H1: Pr{|RD| ≤ 15% when YSI ≥ 100mg/dL or |D| ≤ 15mg/dL when YSI < 100mg/dL} ≥ 0.[ADDRESS_1032981] will be done using data from all subjects, and another using data only from PWD 
subjects.  In the case of all subjects, if n = 350, the critical value is 327.  For  PWD subjects only, 
if n = 315, the critical value is 294.  As in all cases, critical values may require adjustment due to differences in sample sizes.  The critical values are chosen so that the least upper bound on the probability of passing under minima lly acceptable conditions is 95%. 
 
Table 11.1 summarizes critical values for satisfying objectives described in section 2.   The 
column labeled P
o is the minimally acceptable condition (probability) for each objective listed.

results falling within various error ranges (e.g., ±5%, ±7%, ±10%, ±12.5%, ±15%, ±20%).  Tables will be by c linical site and overall.

 Page 31 of 43  Other data analysis follows analyses and presentat ions described in the FDA SMBG: 2016.  See 
Table 11.3 for scheme of data analysis, including capi[INVESTIGATOR_754617]:2016.    
Linear regression will be performed on data comparisons as shown in Tables 11.2 and 11.3.  
Modified Bland -Altman Plots – Modified Bland- Altman plots (difference between evaluation 
device results and reference results plotted against reference results) will be constructed for all 
comparisons described in Tables 11.2 and 11.3.  
 
Confidence Intervals  
Confidence intervals (95%, two- sided) for all primary and secondary objective proportions 
(percents) will be computed using the Clopper -Pearson5 (1934) formula:  
 
𝑃𝑃𝐿𝐿=𝑋𝑋∗𝐹𝐹𝛼𝛼/2−1(2𝑋𝑋,2(𝑛𝑛−𝑋𝑋+1))
𝑛𝑛−𝑋𝑋+1+𝑋𝑋∗𝐹𝐹𝛼𝛼/2−1(2𝑋𝑋,2(𝑛𝑛−𝑋𝑋+1)) 
and: 
𝑃𝑃𝑈𝑈=𝑋𝑋∗𝐹𝐹1−𝛼𝛼/2−1(2𝑋𝑋,2(𝑛𝑛−𝑋𝑋+1))
𝑛𝑛−𝑋𝑋+1+𝑋𝑋∗𝐹𝐹1−𝛼𝛼/2−1(2𝑋𝑋,2(𝑛𝑛−𝑋𝑋+1)) 
PL = lower limit 
PU = upper limit  
X = number of “accurate” results (per the relevant definition of “accurate”)  
 Regression and Outlier Analysis  
A linear regression of the BGMS results against the YSI reference method results via weighted 
least squares (WLS) will be performed, with weights:
 
 
𝑤𝑤=1
𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌2used to account for the proportional variance nature of blood glucose measurements (Draper and Smith, 
1998)6. 
Studentized residuals from the regression w ill be computed, i.e.,  
 
𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖=𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖−𝑦𝑦�𝑖𝑖

That is, a studentized residual, 𝜀𝜀 , is the residual, e , divided by [CONTACT_754633], sε 
𝑠𝑠𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖=𝜎𝜎��1−ℎ𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 
𝜎𝜎�= root mean square error (RMSE) from the regression model. 
and h ii is the leverage for the ith observation.  
 
A BGMS result will be considered an “outlier” if its corresponding studentized residual is outside 
the interval (Φ−1(0.005),Φ−1(0.995) ) ≈ (-2.576, [PHONE_15719]), corresponding to a 99% interval for 
a standard normal variate.  By [CONTACT_754634] “outlier”, results that may satisfy 
accuracy requirements may be considered “outliers”.  
Confidence bands (95% and 99%) for the regression li ne will be computed.  Scatter plots of 
MeterBG vs. LabBG will be constructed, with the regression line, the confidence bands, and the line of identity (Y = X) will all be plotted.   Outliers will be identified.  
 
Error Grid Analyses  
Parkes consensus error  grids will be constructed for combined strip lots, and combined sites as 
described in Tables 11.2 and 11.3.  There are no criteria for percentages of values within the error 
grid zones.

score or rating (1=strongly disagree, 2=disagree, 3=neutral, 4=agree, 5=strongly agree) will be provided by [CONTACT_754636].  For these numerically -scored questions, 
frequency distributions will be tabulated.   
For Questionnaire 1 only:  Hypothesis tests for selected statements will be performed.   The hypotheses are:  
𝐻𝐻
0:𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃{𝑃𝑃𝑒𝑒𝑠𝑠𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑛𝑛𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑒≥3}<90%   versus the alternative:  
𝐻𝐻𝑎𝑎:𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃{𝑃𝑃𝑒𝑒𝑠𝑠𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑛𝑛𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑒≥3}≥90%  
The critical number of responses greater than or equal to 3, Xc, is a function of the actual sample 
size, and will be chosen such that 0.95 = sup Pr {X≥ Xc|100p% = 90%}.  For example, if n = 350, 
then Xc = 307, so that Pr{X≥ Xc|100p% = 90%}≈ 0.9316 ≤ 0.95.  That is, 307 is the number of 
responses ≥ [ADDRESS_1032987] value of Pr {X≥ Xc|100p% = 90%} ≤ 0.95 for n = 350. For 
n = 315, the critical value is Xc  = 300 (power ≈ 0.95).   
 
11.[ADDRESS_1032988] ograms will be constructed where 
appropriate.  A percentage of subjects < [ADDRESS_1032989] hematocrit measurement should be within 0- 70% in order for the subject BG results to be 
considered evaluable for the ISO [ZIP_CODE] analysis.  For the analysis according to the FDA SMBG: 
2016, al l subjects will be considered evaluable.  
The mean, median, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation, will be computed for hematocrit determinations, for subjects with diabetes and for all subjects, by [CONTACT_754637].

In addition, the number of capi[INVESTIGATOR_754621] <80 and > 250 mg/dL will be 
reported.

Capi[INVESTIGATOR_126992]  
1. The study staff will perform a deep finger puncture using a Tenderlett, or similar, lancing 
device, on the subject’s finger.  
2. The study staff will express the blood and collect approximatel y 200 -  300 µL in a blood 
collection tube (e.g. BD Microtainer with lithium heparin).  A hand warmer may be used to improve blood flow and facilitate sample collection.   Detailed instructions are as follows: 
• Typi[INVESTIGATOR_754624] e finger.   It is recommended to practice the 
finger massaging technique prior to puncture.  
• Give subject a hand -warmer to hold for several minutes prior to puncture.  Note that the 
hand- warmer should be moved to the subject’s wrist when ready for puncture a nd kept 
there during the whole collection procedure.  
• Angle finger with tip slightly downward and squeeze fingertip gently prior to puncture.  
• Consider placement of finger puncture device:  Choose a puncture site that will allow you to use your dominant hand to collect the blood.  The device should be aligned so that the 
opening (where the blade comes out) is perpendicular to the grooves of the fingerprint and so that the opening is placed to the side of the finger (not too close to the nail). 
• While continuing to hold the fingertip, squeeze firmly, hold device firmly against side of finger and trigger the blade.  Then turn the finger so that the nail is facing up. 
• Remove pressure from fingertip (to allow capi[INVESTIGATOR_126994]) and collect the first drop. 
• Begin massaging motion – continuous message of sides of the finger – this is critical.  
• Continue massaging finger from base to tip as you continue to collect the blood drops into 
the tube.  If blood flow reduces it may help to press on the nail a bit in between massaging 
the finger.  Having the subject stand up and drop their hand may also help. 
 
Processing of Capi[INVESTIGATOR_126995]  
1. Once collected, process the microtainer tube for laboratory glucose analysis as follows:   
• Label all  tubes with the subject number and a C or a V (Capi[INVESTIGATOR_126996]) as appropriate 
using a Sharpie marker.  Also include a pre -determined notation for the capi[INVESTIGATOR_754625] ( CONTOUR  NEXT or CONTOUR  TV3). 
• Gently  invert the microtainer tube several times to mix the anticoagulant.  
• Centrifuge the whole blood immediately to separate the plasma from the red blood cells.  
Centrifugation must occur within [ADDRESS_1032995].  Timing of all meter testing/centrifugation will be recorded on the appropriate CRF.   
• It is recommended that after centrifugation, the plasma is transferred from the microtainer tube to a micro/dispo tube or similar container.  Ensure the container is labeled and the cap is secured.  
• The capped plasma sample may be kept at room temperature for up to [ADDRESS_1032996] DDC5P -[ZIP_CODE]   CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 Page 38 of 43  2. If testing on the YSI Analyzer is not completed within 4 hours of sample collection, the plasma 
should be refrigerated for up to 24 hours, after which it should be frozen until the sample is 
tested.  
3. Shipment of samples to Ascensia for glucose determinations may be recommended if YSI Analyzers do not meet the accuracy guidelines for the Ascensia traceability control sera. 
Arrangements will be made to ship the samples with dry ice via prepaid express mail should it 
become necessary.  
4. Glucose values of the YSI replicates (controls and plasma) should be within 4 mg/dL or 4% of 
each other; if not, an additional assay should be run.  
5. Insufficient (or suspected to be insuf ficient) samples, missing samples, and other sample issues 
should be recorded in the CRF and on the YSI printout as appropriate.  If a sample is 
hemolyzed, record in the CRF.

 Page 39 of 43  Appendix C -  Instructions for Hematocrit Sample Preparation & Testing  
 
Staff  performing the hematocrit will be trained in this procedure during the initiation visit by [CONTACT_127028].    
1. Two hematocrit tubes will be obtained from each subject’s blood.  One tube will be measured 
and the result recorded on the form.   The second tube will be measured only if the first tube 
was not adequate for measurement.  Note:  
• Sample that is collected from venous blood will be collected in un- treated micro -
hematocrit tubes .   
• Samples collected from capi[INVESTIGATOR_512470] -
hematocrit tubes.    
2. Place a microhematocrit tube against the surface of the blood drop.  Do not place the opening 
of the tube flush against the skin or it will be occluded. 
3. Fill the microhematocrit tube about halfway.  Do not over -fill.  Then immediately place one of 
the microhematocrit tube openings in the clay sealant.  Press into the clay [ADDRESS_1032998] the sealed microhematocrit tube into the micro -centrifuge.   Note: it is ve ry important to 
place the microhematocrit tube in centrifuge rotor with clay side pointed outward.   Spin for 
approx. 2 mins.  Use dialed setting on StatSpin centrifuge.  
5. Reading of hematocrit using StatSpin Crit- reader  
• After collection and centrifugation of hematocrit, place tube rotor in StatSpin Crit- reader, 
with clay side to the right.   
• Slide the marker on the crit -reader to the exact line where the clay and red blood cells meet 
(this is the “0” line).  Press set button until “0” shows in the display.   
• Then move marker all the way over to the other end of the tube to the exact line where the plasma ends – press the set button until “100” shows in the display.   
• Now you are ready to read the hematocrit result.  Slide the marker to the exact line where the red blood cells meet the plasma.  
• The result in the display is the hematocrit percentage for that sample.

HYPOGLYCEMIA ACTION PLAN  
 
CLINICAL CONDITION  HYPOGLYCEMIA ACTION PLAN  
• Blood glucose <70 mg/dL, but ≥50 mg/dL  
• With or without symptoms  • Treat if patient exhibits neuroglycopenic 
symptoms, patient requests or 
investigator discretion  
• No treatment if asymptomatic. If blood 
glucose has not incre ased to ≥70 mg/dL 
after 2 hours, then treat.  
• Treat hypoglycemia with glucose tabs: 16 
grams initially, with repeat treatment every 15 -20 minutes at discretion of 
investigator until blood glucose is 
increasing or blood glucose ≥100 mg/dL  
• Blood glucose <50 mg/dL  
• With or without symptoms  
• Subject able to self -administer glucose 
tabs  • Treat hypoglycemia with glucose tabs: 
16-32 grams (amount at investigator 
discretion) initially , with repeat treatment every 15 -20 minutes at 
discretion of investigator until blood glucose is increasing or blood glucose 
≥100 mg/dL  
• Blood glucose <50 mg/dL  
• Subject is NOT able to self -administer 
glucose tabs  Severe hypoglycemia (defined as a hypoglycemic 
event requiring assistance of another individual to 
activ ely administer treatment)  
• Treat hypoglycemia with 1 mg 
intramuscular glucagon or intravenous 
glucose 20cc of 50% glucose  
• Monitor vital signs and blood glucose 
until glucose returns to normal range and patient regains full consciousness  
• If on an insulin pu mp, suspend insulin 
delivery until glucose is ≥70 mg/dL  
• Transfer to acute care facility at 
discretion of the investigator

 Page 43 of 43  Attachment 1:   Proper Handling of Ascensia YSI Serum Controls  
 
 
Ascensia R&D completed characterization of six -level serum controls purchased from Bio-
Techne® (formerly Bionostics).  During the characterization, staff observed that sample 
stratification during thawing can occur if the control vials are not handled judiciously.  The 
recommended procedure is as follows. 
 
1. Thaw the frozen control amber glass vials at [ADDRESS_1033001] 10 times.  
3. Prepare an aliquot of each level in capped microcentrifuge tubes.  Cap tightly.  We prefer Fisherbrand
™ Microcentrifuge 0.5mL tubes (PN 02- 681-333) with O -ring seal caps (PN 02 -
681-358).  
4. Store any remaining control in the amber glass vials at [ADDRESS_1033002] all thawed control —aliquot tubes and amber 
glass vials —after two weeks.  
8. Since slow thawing for 2 -3 days is recommended, it is advisable to keep an extra thawed set 
available for testing.

ZOLL MEDICAL CORPORATION 1 Introduction 
This document is a protocol for a human research study. This study is to be conducted according 
to US and international standards of Good Clinical Practice (International Conference on Harmonization ICHE6), the Code of Federal Regulations Title 21 parts 803 and 812, and other applicable government regulations. 
1.1 Background 
Annually, over 1 million patients are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_191546] a primary diagnosis of heart failure 
(HF) 1. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_633808], readmissions for acute 
decompensated HF are common and place a significant burden on the healthcare system. Therefore, strategies for outpatient monitoring and fluid management are needed to reduce HF hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]. Rather than low cardiac output, the main reasons for rehospi[INVESTIGATOR_633809] (end-diastolic) pressures
 2. Remote monitoring of these pressure changes 
in addition to its surrogate measures, such as intrathoracic impedance, lung fluid levels, systolic time intervals, or the presence of abnormal heart sounds, may help to prevent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_633810] 
3, 4, 5. In addition, remote 
monitoring may lead to better access to care and coordination of services.    
Given the anticipated importance of remo te HF monitoring and fluid management, ZOLL 
has developed a novel radiofrequency (RF) based heart failure and arrhythmia management system (µCor Heart Failure and A rrhythmia Management System). Using the 
RF data, µCor provides an estimate of the thoracic impedance. In addition, the system records the electrocardiogram (ECG) thr ough adhesive electrodes and respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], 
activity, and posture through a tri-axial accelerometer. The purpose of this study is to 
correlate Cor readings with clinically actionable heart failure events during the ninety days 
after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345].  In addition, the rate of occurrence of VT/VF epi[INVESTIGATOR_633811] 35% will be observed. 
 
1.2 Preclinical Data  
In animal testing, µCor’s noninvasively determined RF thoracic fluid content was compared 
with invasive thermodilution extravascular lung water measurements (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_605943] - Pulsion 
Medical Systems, Munich, [LOCATION_013]). Pulmonary edema was induced in 15 sheep by [CONTACT_633825]. µCor was placed on the left lateral torso of the sheep. The emitted and reflected RF signals are used by µCor to assess thoracic fluid. 
These readings were compared with the readings from the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_633812]. Results of the 
study showed that all 15 sheep developed increases in left ventricular end diastolic pressure, and the onset of pulmonary congestion and edema. A consistent linear correlation (r = 0.97) between measurements of invasive l ung water fluid and noninvasive thoracic fluid 
content was observed. µCor RF signals were able to detect dynamic accumulation of lung 
water in the range of 50-60 ml increments. The change in lung water needed to produce 
congestion was between 250-500 ml. The results of this study support the use of ZOLL’s external RF sensor for high resolution and precise fluid monitoring.       
 
1.3 Clinical Data to Date 
A validation study was conducted in human s ubjects to compare µCor noninvasively-
determined RF thoracic fluid content with invasive thermodilution extravascular lung water

ZOLL MEDICAL CORPORATION measurements (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_605943] - Pulsion Medical Systems, Munich, [LOCATION_013]). [ADDRESS_846385]. Noninvasive thoracic 
fluid assessment was compared to the invas ive extravascular lung water measurement 
every 30 minutes. Cardiac output, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate were also measured. Results showed that the pooled correlation between measurements of invasive lung water fluid and noninvasive thoracic  fluid content was excellent (r = 0.86). 
Also, increases in lung water of 90 ml could be detected by [CONTACT_633826]. Furthermore, lung water change did not correlate to systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, 
cardiac output, and cardiac index (correlation range, r = 0.12-0.54). This study 
demonstrated accuracy and usability of this RF technology to support its use for high resolution fluid monitoring in patients.    
 
1.4 Study Device  
1.4.1 System Components  
µCor consists of the following components: 
A) Patch B) Sensor  
C) Charger  
D) Data transmission device (Gateway) E) Server 
 
Once activated, the wearable Sensor aut omatically acquires ECG, RF readings, heart 
rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], activity, and posture measurements.  Data are automatically 
transmitted from the Sensor to the Data trans mission device, and from there to the Server 
for analysis (see Fig. 1).   
 
 
Figure 1:  Data transmission of µCor  
1.4.2 Patch  
The Patch (Fig. 2) consists of a plastic frame intended for housing the Sensor, and two ECG electrodes on each side of the frame.  The Patch is a single-use, disposable item.

  Figure 2: Patch  
1.4.3 Sensor  
The Sensor (Fig. 3) is a battery powered unit that acquires data.  The Sensor connects to the Patch via the snap-in clip and positioning tabs.  Through the adhesive backing on the Patch, the device becomes wearable. The Sensor is not disposable and needs to be returned to 
ZOLL upon the completion of the study. A light indicator is located close to the center and 
serves to communicate the Sensor’s status at different points of use.  Note that the light indicator is visible only when lit.    
 
    
 
     
 
Figure 3:  Sensor's front view 
1.4.4 Charger  
A dedicated Charger (Fig 4) is supplied with the µCor System for recharging the Sensor and the Data Transmission Device.  A blue light appears when the Charger is connected to an AC outlet.

PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL 
ZOLL MEDICAL CORPORATION We believe that 25-30 heart failure related events will be enough events to draw meaningful 
correlations among Cor device measurements and heart failure related epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841].  
 
Following the interim analysis, the additional 300 subjects will further generate heart failure related clinical events to answer the primary objective and be monitored for VT/VF arrhythmic events to answer the secondary objectives. 
8.[ADDRESS_846405] to either front or side 
location in a 1:[ADDRESS_846406] primary endpoint will be assessed by [CONTACT_633829] Cor device 
readings and heart failure related clinical events.   
 
8.3.2 Secondary endpoints 
The secondary endpoints will also be assessed on their strength of correlation as well as the magnitude of rate of occurrence of VF/VT and arrhythmic death in the subjects with an LVEF 
greater than 35%.     
8.4 Statistical Methods 
For primary, secondary, and safety endpoints, descriptive statistics and qualitative analysis will be performed as appropriate.

8.6 Handling Missing Data 
As with any clinical study, missing data are to be expected during this study.   
8.6.1 Sources of Missing Data

ZOLL MEDICAL CORPORATION [IP_ADDRESS] All attempts to maintain contact [CONTACT_633830] a minimum. This may involve telephone calls. Multiple phone numbers/contacts for each subjects should be collected. 
Multiple reminders of upcoming visits should be made. 
 [IP_ADDRESS] Reasonable windows of time (within 2 days for phone calls and 5 days for clinic visits) have been employed.  [IP_ADDRESS] Routine site monitoring with data verification will occur throughout the study. 
 
8.6.3 Handling missing data   
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Missing data will not be replaced by [CONTACT_633831].  
[IP_ADDRESS] If a subject is missing more than 50% of data, the subject’s data will not be included 
in the analysis. 
 
8.7 Futility Analysis 
The study will be considered ineffective if the interim analysis determine the study will be unsuccessful enrolling the required number of subjects ( ≥[ADDRESS_846407] per center-month), or if 
occurrence of the primary endpoint is deemed insufficient to successfully complete the study with 
the planned number of subjects.  Both an interim and futility analysis will be performed once the [ADDRESS_846408] has completed wear 
time.  Primary and secondary endpoints will be assessed.  With 200 patients completing wear time, it is expected that there would be about 25 -30 heart failure related clinical events.  If during 
the interim and futility assessments, there are less than 5 heart failure events, a protocol change 
will be considered.   
9 Health Economic Evaluation 
The Kansas City Heart Failure Questionnaire will be given to the subjects at all monthly clinic 
visits.  We will develop a model to examine the costs and benefits of using uCor. The model will 
use data from our review of monthly collected questionnaire, heart failure event,  as well as data 
from recognized sources (e.g. national published data, finance department of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]), and 
experts’ advice 
 
10 Safety and Adverse Device Effects 
10.1 Definitions 
All device related adverse effects will be recor ded during the study. All adverse device effects 
(ADEs) will be classified by [CONTACT_633832].

PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL 
ZOLL MEDICAL CORPORATION 10.1.[ADDRESS_846409] (UADE) 
An unanticipated adverse device effect (UADE) is  any adverse device effect not identified by 
[CONTACT_6073], severity or frequency prior to the investigation. When the frequency of an ADE exceeds the previously reported frequency or pre-specified a ccepted level, and if such ADE is critical in 
evaluating one or more of the study endpoints (such as safety endpoint), then an ADE can 
become an UADE and it must be properly reported and evaluated. 
 
10.2 Recording and Reporting of Adverse Device Effects 
10.2.1 Investigator Recording and Reporting 
The Investigators are responsible for recording and reporting all adverse device effects in the 
pertinent case report form (CRF). Unanticipated adverse device effects that pose a safety risk to 
the patient must be reported to sponsor and reviewing IRBs per local reporting requirements. 
 The Investigator must next assess the seriousness of the adverse device effect. The Investigator 
should also assess whether the adverse device e ffect is anticipated or unanticipated.  At each 
contact [CONTACT_1155], the investigator must collect information on adverse device effects. 
 
All adverse device effects occurring during the study period must be recorded.  The clinical course of each event should be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been determined that the study treatment or participation is not the caus e. Serious adverse device effects that are still 
ongoing at the end of the study period must be followed up to determine the final outcome. Any 
serious adverse device effects that occur within [ADDRESS_846410] receive both Sponsor and the investigator’s IRB approval before they are initiated unless subject safety is at  risk. Any protocol deviations initiated without 
Sponsor and the investigator’s IRB approval that may affect the scientific soundness of the study, 
or affect the rights, safety, or welfare of study subjects, must be reported to the Sponsor and to the investigator’s IRB as soon as a possible, but no later than 30 working days (or less if specified 
by [CONTACT_093]’s IRB).

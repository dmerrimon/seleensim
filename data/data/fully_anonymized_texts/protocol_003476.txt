 INTRODUCTION  
 
Migraine headache has a 1 -year period prevalence in the US of 11.7% and accounts for 
approximately 1.2 million migraine visits to US emergency departments per year [1,2] . There are 
numerous studies that discuss treatment for migraine  and other benign  headaches within the 
emergency  department , however, there are very few that discuss specifically the use of 
intravenous fluids  (IVF)  for headache  treatment  [3]. Many of these studies look at various 
options for treating migr aine and other benign headaches: treatment options include dopamine 
antagonists, opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] , non -steroid  anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), triptans,  anti-epi[INVESTIGATOR_278380]  [2]. Comparisons have been done between many of these treatment options 
with dopamine antagonists  appeari ng to be the most effective, compared  to other treatments [ 4, 
5, 6, 7 ]. The dopamine antagonist with the most evidence and availability for benign headaches 
is prochlorperazine [6, 7, 8 ,9, 10, 11 , 12]. 
 
Peripheral  IVs and administration are common procedu res and treatments within the ED. And 
while relatively  safe, they are not without their own risks [13, 14, 15, 16]. Given that IVF 
administration  is a common part of treatment regimen for benign headache  patients  in the 
emergency department and given the lack of randomized trials in adults, we aim to study the use 
of IVF on pain reduction in headache  patients in the adult ED [3]. Given the specific definition  
of migraine headache, we have chosen to categorize our headaches as benign  headaches, 
avoiding the difficulty of determining if a patient meets the specific criteria for migraine 
headache [ 17, 18 ]. There has been one randomized trial in pediatrics that shows  IVF may help in 
patients with migraines, whereas the  adult literature has no randomized  control trials and a 
review of data shows that fluids do not help relieve pain in migraine headache patients [3 , 19, 
20].  
 
We will design a single blinded  randomized trial to study the e ffects of IVF on benign  headache s 
There are numerous challenges using the International Headache Society guidelines for 
controlled drug trials in acute migraines, including having a patient population that knows the 
specifics of migraine headaches and meet s the exact definition. In order to facilitate  obtaining the 
necessary number of patients we will include all benign  headache patients  [17,18 ]. 
 
METHODS  
Study Design  
This will be a single center , prospective , single  blinded randomized controlled trial on a 
convenience sample of patients presenting to the adult or pediatric ED with a chief complaint of 
headache.  Subjects will only be enrolled when a physician  or research assistant who is familiar 
with the study protocol is av ailable t o enroll patients .   
 
Selection of Participants  
IVF Headache Protocol V [ADDRESS_340109] found that patients presenting to the ED with an undifferentiated headache 
improve with all the above -described headache medications regardless of whether or not they 
meet the definition of migraine, tension headache, or another primary headache disorder [ 7, 8, 
11].  Therefore, this study will enroll all patients between the ages of 1 0 and 65 who meet all of 
the inclusion criteria and do not meet any of the exclusion criteria, w ho present to the ED with a 
benign headache.   
 
Inclusion Criteria  
Patients who present to the ED with complaint of a headache with the following criteria:  
➢ Age 10 to 65 years  
➢ Temperature < 100.4  F 
➢ Normal neurologic exam and normal mental status  
 
Exclusion Criteria  
➢ Pregnant . 
➢ Meningeal signs are present  
➢ Acute angle closure glaucoma is suspected.   
➢ Head trauma within the previous two weeks  
➢ Lumbar puncture within the previous two weeks  
➢ Thunderclap onset of the headache  
➢ Known allergy to one of the stu dy drugs.  
➢ History of intracranial hypertension.  
➢ Is a prisoner  
➢ Patient declined informed consent  
➢ Non-English  speaking patient  or parent/guardian  for pediatric patients  
➢ Attending provider excludes patient   
➢ Severe dehydration  
 
Informed Consent  
Written, informed consent will be obtained from each patient.  Consent will include a discussion 
of the risks and benefits.  In addition to parental informed consent in the pediatric population, 
age appropriate verbal assent will be obtained  from pediatric  subjects.  
 
Risk/Benefit  
The risks are the side effects associated with each drug.  For prochlorperazine , this includes 
drowsiness, blurred vision, xerostomia, congestion, nausea, akathisia , tardive dyskinesia, NMS, 
and blood dyscrasias.  For Benadryl include sedation, tiredness, sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], dizziness, 
constipation, dry mouth, blurred vision, nausea, and loss of appetite .  For normal saline, this 
IVF Headache Protocol V [ADDRESS_340110] treatment arm to receive 
prochlorperazine 0.15 mg/kg up to 10 mg IV along with diphenhydramine 1mg/kg (up to 50 mg)  
IV and normal saline at 5 mL/h  IV OR to the study arm to receive prochlorperazine along with 
diphenhydramine IV and normal saline at 20 m L/kg (up to 1000 mL ) given IV over [ADDRESS_340111] the prochlorperazine will 
be admini stered .  The patient will then be connected  to normal saline on an IV pump and 
randomized to 5 cc  over an hour  or 20 cc/kg (maximum  1000 cc ) over one hour. The IV ba g and 
pump will be covered so that the patient will not know how much fluid they are receiving.  
Patients will undergo simple randomization to either the fluid bolus group or the control group. 
The treating physician will consult a folder that contains a li st specifying the group assignment. 
Each row of the list corresponded to a patient, and will be covered by a small slip of opaque 
paper that will be removed at the time of enrolment to reveal the group assignment. This list was 
constructed at the beginning  of the study using a random number generator by a research staff .  
Randomization in the pediatric ED and adult ED will be separate to ensure equal numbers of 
pediatric patients in both the experi mental and control arms (blocking).   Emergency providers 
will be instructed not to administer any rescue medications for at least 30 minutes.   
 
Safety  
After 30 minutes, the treating provider will be permitted to administer a “rescue medication” of 
their choice  for further treatment.  If there is an untoward event that requires the patient  to know 
which IVF dose  was administered, patient  will unblinded and will not continue in the study.  
 
Reportable Events  
Anticipated side effects are those listed on the manufa cturer’s package insert and are treated as 
routine non -urgent or non -emergent events are not reportable events.  
Adverse Events are those unanticipated side effects that require interventions or anticipated side 
effects that do not respond to intervention.  
Serious Adverse Events are those side effects that require Advanced Life Support measures to 
control symptoms.  
AEs and SAEs will be reported to the IRB within [ADDRESS_340112] ion form to include age, sex, race, phone 
number, and baseline headache severity using a 100 -mm visual analog scale (VAS).  Repeat 
headache severity scores will be measured at 30 and 60 minutes .  Time zero begins immediately 
after complete administration o f the study drug.  Nausea (with a 100 m m VAS)  and vomiting  
will also be assessed at these time intervals.  The need for rescue medications will be extracted 
from the patient’s chart at a later time.   
 
Trained research assistants will call the patient [ADDRESS_340113] -discharge by [CONTACT_278383] y having a headache (yes or no)  and to rate their  current pain (0 -10). If the 
patient is admitted, the patient will be approached in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_278381].      
 
Outcome Measures  
The primary outcome measure wil l be the difference in pain scores between the 5 cc over an 
hour and 20 mg/kg (up to 1000 cc ) over an hour  groups  measured as the absolute difference 
between the means at [ADDRESS_340114] 
protected computer in the locked Emergency Medicine research office.  All research assistants 
and investigators are HIPAA - trained, CITI trained and credentialed by [CONTACT_278384], and oriented 
to the study protocol.  
 
Data Analysis : 
Assuming a SD  of 22 (based on prior data from our institution), we calculated  that we would 
need 45 patients in each group to find a clinically  important difference in pain score reduction  
(13 mm)  between groups at  [ADDRESS_340115] 80% power and an alpha of 0.05.  
 
The groups will be compared using a t -test on gender, race, and age; and a chi (with Yates 
correction) -squared test on severity of presenting headache, to determine if they are similar.  The 
individual VAS measurements will be compared using a repeated measures analysis of variance 
(ANOVA) t est.

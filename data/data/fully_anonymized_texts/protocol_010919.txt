2. Purpose of the Study  / Objectives  
Objective  
The overall objectives of this study are to build, implement, and measure the impact of a quality 
improvement bundle to increase the proportion of thyroidectomy and parathyroidectomy 
postoperative patients who are discharged without new opi[INVESTIGATOR_16447] s.  
 
Research aims  
Aim 1. Build the quality improvement bundle  
Through cooperation of the Opi[INVESTIGATOR_653469], information technology department, 
and surgical medical team, our research team will deploy a quality improvement bundle that will 
include  (1) patient education, (2) provider education, and (3) electronic health record (EHR) 
configuration.   
Aim 1a. Educate patients  
Educational material will be adapted or newly developed and provided to patients prior to surgery 
(e.g., 1 -page educational fly er) to set realistic pain and function goals and to discuss the role of 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_737799]. Additional education material will be prepared 
and given to patients at hospi[INVESTIGATOR_737800] r egimen 
and to emphasize the importance of non -opi[INVESTIGATOR_737801] -pharmacological pain 
management strategies following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]. Patient educational materials will be 
delivered as part of routine medical care.  
Aim 1b. Educate providers  
Since most discharge opi[INVESTIGATOR_737802], the research team will provide education to establish best practices for opi[INVESTIGATOR_737803]. Using a collaborative approach, the resea rch team will provide in -service 
presentations and design and deploy pocket guides and wall flyers that remind providers of best 
practices during discharge planning activities.  
Aim 1c. Enhance EHR support via new thyroid/parathyroid surgery perioperative and 
discharge order sets  
Non-opi[INVESTIGATOR_737804].  
Example of a perioperative multimodal analgesia (MMA)  regimen 1,2  
1. Approximately one hour before procedure initiation: acetaminophen [ADDRESS_1008116] of care intraoperative anesthesia: intravenous pro pofol, midazolam, and fentanyl  
+ inhaled anesthetics + antiemetics (intravenous dexamethasone and ondansetron) + 
subcutaneous infiltration with 1% lidocaine, with 1:100000 epi[INVESTIGATOR_440211], or 0.25% 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_72160] 1:200 000 epi[INVESTIGATOR_440211]  
3. Following resumption of oral intak e after the procedure: ibuprofen 600 mg PO and 
acetaminophen 500 mg PO every 6 hours, on an alternate staggered schedule (1 agent 
every 3 hours) for the initial [ADDRESS_1008117]/order set will be developed with defaults to non -opi[INVESTIGATOR_737805]. If opi[INVESTIGATOR_737806] a second -line option, the medi cal record will default to 
short durations and low doses.  
Examples of first line non -opi[INVESTIGATOR_737807] (order set defaults):  
• Acetaminophen (TYLENOL) 325 mg PO Q4H -6H PRN for mild pain for up to 7 days  
• Acetaminophen (TYLENOL) 500 mg PO Q6H P RN for moderate pain for up to 7 days  
• Ibuprofen 200 to 600 mg PO Q6H PRN for moderate pain for up to 7 days  
• Naproxen sodium (ALEVE) 220 mg PO Q24H PRN for moderate pain for up to 7 days  
Examples of second line opi[INVESTIGATOR_737808]:  
• Tramadol 50 mg PO  Q6H PRN for moderate pain for up to 5 days (#10)  
• Acetaminophen -codeine (TYLENOL WITH CODEINE #3) 300 -30 mg Q6H PRN for 
moderate pain for up to 5 days (#10)  
Aim 2. Implement the quality improvement bundle  
The team will secure necessary hospi[INVESTIGATOR_737809]. Perioperative EHR order 
sets will be built by [CONTACT_737853] t echnology analys ts and will be validated by 
[CONTACT_737854]. The team will carefully 
select a go -live date using strategies that are customary for quality improvement implementations 
at Houston Methodist Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17399] l. The educational materials for patients will be implemented on a 
single date in all surgeon clinics and within the discharge process workflow. Provider educational 
material will be handed out and displayed in surgery floors, and multiple educational lect ures will 
be held for different teams and shifts within a [ADDRESS_1008118] of the bundle  
Following complete implementation of all components of the bundle from Aim 2 ( planned for 
quarter 4 of 2020  and quarter 1 of 2021 ), investigators  will start to collect post -implementation 
data and will measure the proportion of thyroidectomy and parathyroidectomy postoperative 
patients who do not receive new opi[INVESTIGATOR_737810]. The post implementation data 
(quarter s 2 and 3 of 2021 ) will be compared to the historical (baseline) data obtained from January 
2018 to December 2019.

 Endpoints  
Primary endpoint  
The primary endpoint will be the proportion of thyroidectomy and parathyroidectomy postoperative 
patients who do not receive new opi[INVESTIGATOR_737810]. This outcome excludes 
continuation of previous, chronic opi[INVESTIGATOR_2538].  
Secondary endpoints  
• Proportion of thyroidectomy and parathyroidectomy patients with opi[INVESTIGATOR_737811] 112.5 oral MMEs3 
• Proportion of postoperative patients with opi[INVESTIGATOR_737812] 5 days  
• Proportion of thyroidectomy and parathyroidectomy postoperative patients who do not receive 
new opi[INVESTIGATOR_737813]’s office within 7 days of surgery including discharge 
prescriptions. This outcome excludes continuation of previous, chronic opi[INVESTIGATOR_737814] 
• Proportion of postoperative patients with opi[INVESTIGATOR_737815] 50 oral MMEs/day when 
new postoperative discharge prescriptions are added to existing opi[INVESTIGATOR_737816] a quality improvement bundle  including patient education, provider 
education, and EHR support increase the proportion of thyroidectomy and parathyroidectomy 
postoperative patients who are discharged without new opi[INVESTIGATOR_75155] ?  
 
3. Background  
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_737817] -term opi[INVESTIGATOR_737818] 99% of postoperative patients receive opi[INVESTIGATOR_2467], and 14% experience 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -related adverse effects, which increase hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14051], length of stay, and 30 -day

overdose.7,8 Approximately 6% of patients persistently use new opi[INVESTIGATOR_737820] 90 to 180 days 
after major or minor surgery. The incidence of new, persistent opi[INVESTIGATOR_737821] 5% after 
thyroidectomy and 6% after parathyroidectomy procedures.9 
Optimal opi[INVESTIGATOR_737822], the optimal duration of initial opi[INVESTIGATOR_737823] 4 to 9 days.10 
Patients undergoing thyroid and parathyroid surgeries can be di scharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_737824] 20 to 70 oral morphine milligram equivalents (MMEs), and approximately 
93% of patients will consume less than 100 oral MMEs within 2 weeks following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7954].11,12 Recently, a multidisciplinary expert panel with patient engagement published 
surgery specific recommendations suggesting less than 112.5 oral MMEs for opi[INVESTIGATOR_737825].3 However, up to 33% to 58% of patients 
undergoing thyroid and parathyroid surgeries do not need any opi[INVESTIGATOR_737826].[ADDRESS_1008119] successfully 
reduced the proportion of patients discharged with opi[INVESTIGATOR_737827] 5%.1,[ADDRESS_1008120] Opi[INVESTIGATOR_737828].14 Six quality indicators focused on appropriat e patient discharge on an 
adequate acute pain management regimen:  
• Proportion of opi[INVESTIGATOR_737829] a duration greater than 7 days  
• Proportion of discharged patients with opi[INVESTIGATOR_737830] ≥ 50 MME per day

4. Study Design  
Overview  
This quality improvement, quasi -experimental study will be conducted in Houston Methodist 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_737836] 4 of 2020  and quarter 1 of 
2021 . The pre -implementation (baseline) data on patients treated in  [ADDRESS_1008121] 80 
qualifying patients accrued over a 4- to 6-month period following the deployed bundle. Patients 
who underwent a thyroidectomy or parathyroidec tomy procedure will be retrospectively identified 
using the ACS National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP®) data base and 
data reports from the Houston Methodist information technology department.

Opi[INVESTIGATOR_737795] [ADDRESS_1008122]-implementation patients will 
be accrued ov er a 4- to 6-month period ( quarters 2 and 3 of 2021 ). The analysis and final report 
will be completed and submitted to the University of Houston prior to December  31, [ADDRESS_1008123] of 
candidate cova riates includes: (1) pre -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_737837] (opi[INVESTIGATOR_2583]ïve vs. non -naïve), (2) ASA 
score, (3) age, (4) surgery complexity, (5) surgery duration, (6) cancer diagnosis, (7) AUC of 
postoperative pain scores documented up to 12 hours prior to discharge, and (8 ) postoperative 
oral opi[INVESTIGATOR_736782] (or number of opi[INVESTIGATOR_6086]) administered up to 12 hours prior to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7954].  
Sample size estimates  
The historical control data will include 160 patients who underwent a thyroidectomy or a 
parathyroidectomy procedur e from January 2018 to December 2019. Twenty patients will be 
randomly sampled from each of the 8 quarters during the baseline period to provide historical 
trend leading up to the implementation. Using preliminary data, investigators estimate that 35% 
of thyroidectomy and parathyroidectomy patients were discharged without new opi[INVESTIGATOR_327544] 2018 and 2019.  
The quality improvement bundle is expected to result in an absolute risk increase of 20% in the 
primary outcome . Table 3 shows estimated sample sizes that were calculated before pre-
implementation (baseline) data  was collected and that were not adjusted for potential 
confounders.

implementation sample 
size 
35% 20% 55% 68 
40% 20% 60% 70 
45% 20% 65% 69 
The estimates provided in the table above assumed a historical control sample size of 160 
patients and estimated samples sizes needed to obtain 80% power using a 2 -sided alpha of 0.05  
 
After obt aining pre-implementation (baseline) data , investigators dete rmined that the historical 
control proportion was 20%. Preliminary models were built to evaluate the effect of potential 
confounders on the proportion of patients who do not receive new opi[INVESTIGATOR_737838] . It was determined that 19% to 25% of the variability in the outcome was explained by 
[CONTACT_10994] (R2 of 0.19 to 0.25). To ensure adequate  sample size, a conservative approach was 
used, and sample size was adjusted by [CONTACT_737855] (1/1 -R2).15,16 For a historical 
group with a sample size of 160 and a baseline proportion of 20%, a post -implementation sample 
size of 80 patients would provide 80% power to detect an absolute risk increase o f 20% . 
 
Statistical analyses will be conducted using STATA version 15 (StataCorp LP, College Station, 
[LOCATION_007]). All patient demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarized using 
descriptive statistics. Continuous variables will be reported using mean (a nd standard deviation) 
or median (and interquartile range). Categorical variables will be reported with counts and 
percentages. Confidence intervals at the 95% level will be calculated for proportions of patients 
with primary and secondary outcomes.  
 
Secondary analysis  
Trends of the primary outcome will be described over each quarter of the pre -implementation, 
control cohort starting January [ADDRESS_1008125] -implementation cohort in quarters 2 and 3 of 2021.   
 
Primary endpoint  
The primary endpoint will be the proportion of thyroidectomy and parathyroidectomy postoperative 
patients who do not receive new opi[INVESTIGATOR_737810]. This outcome excludes 
continuation of previous, chronic  opi[INVESTIGATOR_2538].  
Secondary endpoints  
• Proportion of thyroidectomy and parathyroidectomy patients with opi[INVESTIGATOR_737839] 112.5 oral MMEs3 
• Proportion of postoperative patients with opi[INVESTIGATOR_737812] 5 days  
• Proportion of thyroidectomy and parathyroidectomy postoperative patients who do not receiv e 
new opi[INVESTIGATOR_737813]’s office within 7 days of surgery including discharge 
prescriptions. This outcome excludes continuation of previous, chronic opi[INVESTIGATOR_2538]  
• Proportion of postoperative patients with opi[INVESTIGATOR_737840] 50 oral MMEs/day when 
new postoperative discharge prescriptions are added to existing opi[INVESTIGATOR_737841] [ADDRESS_1008126] (EPIC) through 
manual chart review. In addition to data collection from EPIC, investigators ask for permission to 
collect data on opi[INVESTIGATOR_737842]. This data would be collected 
from the [LOCATION_007] Prescription Monitoring Program (PMP) that collects and monitors prescription 
data for all Schedule II, III, IV, and V Controlled Substances dispensed by a pharmacy in [LOCATION_007] 
or to a [LOCATION_007] resident from a pharmacy located in another state.  
In ad dition to securely storing study data on the HM secure intranet, investigators ask for 
permission for study data capture, storage, and retrieval on Houston Methodist’s secure and 
password protected REDCap instance (Holly Hall Datacenter). Data collection f orms may also be 
built in Microsoft Excel® or Microsoft Access® to collect and record data.

Page 9SUMMARY
PF-06293620 (RN909) is a gluca gon receptor antagonist being developed for the treatment of 
type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
Glucagon counteracts glucose- lowering by  [CONTACT_858102], thereb y maintaining eugly cemia and protecting against hy poglycem ia; thus,
mitigating the effects of hy perglucagonemia in T2DM is an attractive approach for treating 
hypergly cemia .
PF-[ADDRESS_1195572] -in-human study is a rando mized, double -blinded (Sponsor -open), 
placebo- controlled, single ascending -dose (SAD) and multiple ascending dose (MAD) study  
in subjects with T2DM on a stable regimen of metformin.   This population was chosen 
because it is the target population for this i nvestigational drug and the preclinical studies 
support its safety for initiating clinical trials in medically -stable T2DM subjects.  T he SAD 
portion of the study  will be conducted in approximately  5planned cohorts (a 6:2 ratio of 
active drug to placebo )with a total of up to approximately  40subjects in an effort to seek a 
maximum tolerated dose (MTD).  PF-06293620 will be administered subcutaneously (SC) at 
doses of 0.3, 1, 3, and 6 mg/kg.  In addition, a 1mg/kg dose will be given intravenously (IV)
after the SC doses .
Based on a review of the preliminary , unpublished safet y,pharmacokinetics ( PK)and 
pharmacod ynamics ( PD)results from the first four SAD dose cohorts , a randomized, 
double -blind (Sponsor open), placebo -controlled, multiple asce nding dos e (MAD) portion 
will be initiated to evaluate the safet y and tolerability  of ascending multiple dosages and 
dosing -schedules. The MAD cohorts will run in paralle l with the remaining SAD cohorts. 
This portion will be conducted in approximatel y 4planned c ohorts (a 8:2 ratio of 
PF-06293620: placebo ) with a total of up to approximately  40subjects in an effort to seek a 
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) when multiple doses are administered.  Both s ubjects and 
the site personnel will be blinded to treatment and tre atment regimen . The Q4 week dosing 
cohort ssubjects will receive a subcutaneous administration of  study  drug (PF -06293620 or 
placebo) every  4weeks (on Days1, 29 and 57) at 75 mg, 150 mg or 250 mg. Based on the 
ongoing review of the safety  data of the p revious SAD and MAD cohort(s) the order of 
initiation of the MAD cohorts may be adjusted. Ongoing MAD safet y data will be used to 
determine the dose and dose regimen of the fourth planned cohort .  At no time will the MAD 
dose exceed the PK exposure from the SAD. An additional fifth cohort may  bestudied to 
obtain further safet y and PK data ,increasing the planned total number of subjects to 
approximatel y 50.  
PF-06293620 
B3501001
Final Protocol Amendment 302 October 2015
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 10The MAD cohorts will run in parallel with the later (Cohort 4and higher) cohorts of the SAD 
study. Subjects who participate in the SAD portion of the study  and tolerate PF -06293620 
may enroll in the MAD portion of the study  after a sufficient wash -out period, if they  are 
negative for anti-drug antibodies ( ADA), and they  meet all other eligibility  criteria.
Plasma glucagon and GLP-1 levels will be used as biomarkers to assess pharmacody namics
(PD) related to target modulation.  A number of gly cemic parameters will be used to assess 
pharmacod ynamics related to gly cemic control:  fasting plasma gluco se (FPG), postprandial 
glycemia (during mixed meal tolerance test [ MMTT]), 24 hour glucose area under the curve 
(AUC) and mean dail y glucose (from fingerstick assessment), 1,5- anhydroglucitol, 
fructosamine and HbA1c .  In conjunct ion with some of these tests (e g,MMTT), insulin and 
C-peptide levels will also be measured to gain additional insights into PF-[ADDRESS_1195573] in human study  is to evaluate the safet y, tolerability and 
immunogenicity  of single, ascending, subcutaneous (SC) and intravenous (IV) administration 
ofPF-[ADDRESS_1195574] 
of PF-06293620 on glucose, insulin, GL P-1, C- peptide and glucagon excursions over 4 hrs 
following an MMTT , and 24 hour glucose profiles. Additional exploratory  objectives in the 
MAD portion will include 24 hour ambulatory  blood pressure monitoring ,and central review 
of electrocardiograms ( ECGs ).
This study  is exploratory  in nature; no pre -planned hy pothesis testing is to be performed. 
The sample size determination is not based on statistical power considerations.  Dose cohort
size in the SAD portion is generall y 8subjects with a 6:2 ratio of active drug to placebo in a 
randomized manner and isgenerall y 10subjects with a 8:2ratio of active drug to placebo in 
a randomized manner in the MAD portion. Additional subjects may  be added at a dose level 
to further evaluate safet y and/or tolerability  after discussions between the [COMPANY_007] study  team 
and the investigators.
Adverse events, electrocardiograms (ECG) , blood pressure, pulse rate, continuous cardiac 
monitoring (SAD only ), ambulatory  blood pressure monitoring (MAD cohorts only ),and 
safet y laboratory  data will be reviewed and summarized on an ongoing basis during the study  
to evaluate the safet y of subjects.  Safet y data will be presented in tabular and/or graphical 
format an d summarized descriptivel y, where appropriate.
The serum pharmacokinetic (PK)parameters (AUC (0-∞), Cmax, Cav, Cmin, AUC (0-t[last]),AUC,
Tmax, T1/2,Rac, CLor CL /F, Vz/F or Vss and F ) for RN 909(PF-06293620) will be 
summarized descriptively b y dose as appropriate .  Serum concentrations will be listed and 
summarized descriptively b y dose and nomina l PK sampling time.  I ndividual subject,

The change and percentage change from baseline for PD biomarkers over the period of t he 
study  will be tabulated by  [CONTACT_11877] .  Summary  statistics of change from baseline 
values over time per dose group will also be tabulated.  Data will be presented in tabular 
and/or graphical format and summarized descriptively .  Placebo subject s will be pooled 
across all dose cohorts for the respective stages of the study ,ie,SAD placebo subjects and 
MAD placebo subjects. To explore the treatment effect , the mean change from baseline over 
time with active treatment will be compared to the mean change from baseline over time with 
placebo treated subjects .

Page 251. INTRODUCTION
1.1. Indication
PF-06293620 (RN909) is a glucagon receptor antagonist being developed for the treatment of 
type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
1.2. Background 
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a metabolic disorder afflicting over [ADDRESS_1195594] demonstrated that improved glycemic control is associated with decreased microvascular complications ( Patel; Turner ).
In addition to insulin, glucagon is a major hormone maintaining moment-to-moment glucose
homeostasis.  Glucagon counteracts glucose-lowering by [CONTACT_858104], thereby [CONTACT_858105].  There is a growing appreciation for the potential role of glucagon in contributing tohyperglycemia in T2DM stemming from the observation that glucagon levels areinappropriately elevated in the T2DM hyperglycemic milieu ( Ali; Dunning ).  Therefore, 
mitigating the effects of hyperglucagonemia in T2DM is an attractive approach for treating hyperglycemia.
PF-[ADDRESS_1195595]-in-human study is a randomized, double-blinded (Sponsor-open), 
placebo-controlled, single ascending-dose (SAD) and multiple ascending-dose (MAD) studyin subjects with T2DM on a stable regimen of metformin. This population was chosen because it is the target population for this investigational drug and the preclinical studies support its safety for initiating clinical trials in medically-stable T2DM subjects.  Furthermore, studying this population affords the opportunity to obtain an earlier assessment of this investigational drug’s pharmacodynamic activities, allowing for dose selection in future studies.  Plasma glucagon and GLP-1 levels will be used as biomarkers to assess pharmacodynamics related to target modulation.  A number of glycemic parameters will be used to assess pharmacodynamics related to glycemic control:  fasting plasma glucose (FPG), postprandial glycemia (during mixed meal tolerance test [MMTT]), 24 hour glucose AUC and weighted mean daily glucose (from fingerstick assessment), 1,5-anhydroglucitol, fructosamine and HbA1c.  In conjunction with some of these tests (eg, MMTT), insulin and C-peptide levels will also be measured to gain additional insights into PF-06293620 effects on glucose homeostasis.
To fully characterize the safety profile, the investigational drug will be administered 
subcutaneously (SC) and intravenously (IV) in the SAD cohorts.  PF-[ADDRESS_1195596] completed Day 15 assessments before proceeding to the next higher dosage level.
Based on a review of the preliminary, unpublished safety, pharmacokinetic (PK) and PD 
results from the first four SAD dose cohorts, a randomized, double-blind (Sponsor open), placebo-controlled, multiple asceding dose (MAD) portion will be initiated to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ascending multiple dosages and dosing-schedules. The MAD cohorts will run in parallel with the remaining SAD cohorts.  Based on the ongoing review of CCI

Page 28the safet y data of the previous SAD and MAD cohort(s) the order of initiation of the MAD 
cohorts may  be adjusted. MAD safet y data from the previous cohort(s) will be used to 
determine the dose and dose regimen of the fourth planned cohort .  At no time will the MAD 
dose exceed the PK exposure from the SAD. An additional fifth cohort may  be studied to 
obtain further safet y and PK data ,increasing the planned total number of subjects to 
approximatel y 50.   For MAD dose escalation, the decision to proceed to the next dose will be 
made b y the [COMPANY_007] study team and the Investigators after review of the available safety and 
tolerability  data after 80% of th e subjects in the previous cohort have received one dose and 
have been followed for [ADDRESS_1195597] be 
completed  before initiating enrollme nt in a new cohort.
1.3.2. Preliminary Unpublished Data (blinded)
Subject Disposition and Baseline Characteristics (data -cutoff May 19, 2015)
Thirty -sixsubjects have been randomized, of which 12have completed the study . To date, 
three subjects have discontinued from the study . One subject i n Cohort 4 was no longer 
willing to participate and discontinued on Day 8; this subject was replaced with another 
subject. Two other subjects were no longer willing to participate in the study  and were 
terminated early  (1each i n the 1.0 mg/kg cohort and the 3.0mg/kg cohort )and were not 
replaced.  
The baseline characteristics of the subjects randomized to date in the SAD study  are

1.3.3. Dose Rationale
The initial starting dose was selected based upon the results from preclinical 
pharmacological, PK and toxicology  studies as well as PK/PD modeling and simulation.   The 
maximum recommended human starting dose (MRSD) was det ermined based on the 
“no-observed -adverse- effect -level” (NOAEL) in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_22735], 3 -month, monkey  toxicology  
study .Proposed doses, along with anticipated safety  margins are listed in Table 3 below .

*Margin calculated based on the NOAEL exposure/predicted human exposure
Source: Table 2.5 -2 (Clinical Overvie w)
The proposed starting dose of 0.3mg/kg SC represents a 667-foldlower dose than the 
NOAEL dose of 200 mg/kg (SC) in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_22735], 3 -month, toxicity  study .  Furthermore , the 
starting dose is approximately  3-fold less than the minimum efficacious dose of 1 mg/kg in 
monkey  and is expected to show no to minimal pharmacological response in humans.   The 
predicted maximal PF -06293620 concentration (Cmax) of 3.16 µg/mL  is 620-fold lower than 
the observed C maxand the predicted AUC of 1144 g∙h/mL  is 162-fold lower than the 
observed AUC at the NOAEL  dose of 200 mg/kg (SC) in the [ADDRESS_1195603] udy is 10 mg/kg IV. The predicted human 
Cmaxand AUC at the highest proposed dose would be approximatel y 31-and 9-fold below 
the maximum observed exposures at 200 mg/kg (IV) in monkey  in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_22735], 3 -month, 
toxicity  study , respectively .  The dosage range encompasses the theoretical efficacious dose .
However, based on preliminary , unpublished PD results in subjects receiving single 
ascending doses up to 6 mg/kg SC, maximal (nadir) decrease in FPG appeared to plateau by  
3mg/kg and no additional FPG lowe ring is expected at 10 mg/kg IV.  Therefore, it is not 
necessary  to test the highest dose, 10 mg/kg IV, initially  proposed in the study  and hence has 
been removed in the current amendment .

The proposed PF -06293620 doses in the MAD portion were selected based on the 
preliminary  PK/PD anal ysis and simulation from available data from the first 4cohorts in the 
ongoing SAD study .  Fixed dos ages of 75 , 150 and 250 mg Q4W were selected for this study 
to allow for adequate characterization of both the dose -response relationship for gly cemic 
analytes (FPG, MMTT, mean dail y glucose [ MDG ]and HbA1C), as well as to identify  the 
maximum tolerated dose.  Modeling suggests minimal accumulation (Rac=1.14) of 
PF-[ADDRESS_1195604] dose (250 mg Q4W, ~3.1 mg/kg) is not expected to exceed 
the observed exposure at 6 mg/kg single -dose. The 6 mg /kgdose was found to be safe and 
well-tolerated.  Guided by  [CONTACT_121287] -response relationship for baseline-adjusted FPG, the 
doses of 75 mg, 150 mg and 250 mg Q 4Ware deemed appropriate and adequate to allow for 
characterization of the dose- response relation ship for PK, and PD changes.  The 250 mg dose 
is expected to result in maximal fasting plasm glucose lowering .  The 75mg Q4W would 
approximatel y represent the dose for 50% maximal effect ( ED50)and an intermediate dose 
of [ADDRESS_1195605] proposed dose would be approximately 
122-and 20- fold below , respectivel y,the maximum observed exposures at 200 mg/kg (SC)

3.STUDY DESIGN
3.1.Study Overview
This is a randomized, placebo -controlled, double -blind (sponsor unblinded; subjects and 
Investigator blinded ), single dose, and multiple -dose dose escalation study  of
PF-[ADDRESS_1195606] 4 SAD 
cohorts, the 1mg/kg IV cohort will be evaluated but the 10 mg/kg I V cohort will not be 
conducted . Approximately  4multiple dose cohorts are planned in an effort to seek a 
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and evaluate diff erent dosages for safet y and toler ablity.  
The multiple -dose cohorts will be initiated based on a review of the preliminary , unpublished
safet yand PK results from the first three SAD dose cohorts. The planned dosage s, the route 
of administration , frequenc y of administration and the approximate number of subjects for 
the SAD cohorts are shown in Table 5and for the MAD cohorts in Table 6below .  
Single -Dose Cohorts:
The SAD portion will be conducted in approximately  5planned cohorts (a 6:2 ratio of active 
drug to placebo) with a total of up to approximately  40subjects in an effort to seek a 
maximum tolerated dose (MTD). PF-06293620 will be administered subcutaneously (SC) at 
doses of 0.3, 1, 3, and 6 mg/kg.  I n addition, a 1 mg/kg dose,will be given intravenously  (IV). 
Thescreening period will last up to [ADDRESS_1195607] approximatel y 
84days.  Subjects will be required to be on stable, daily  dosages of metformin.  Subjects wil l 
receive a single dose of study  treatment (PF-06293620 or placebo) on Day 1, with multiple 
PK and safet y assessments during the confinement period in Clinical Research Unit (CRU) 
on study  Day s -1, 1, 2, 3 and 4 and will be discharged on Day 5.  The subjec ts will return to 
the CRU for subsequent visits at which time safety assessments, including AE monitoring, 
clinical laboratory  tests, vital signs, and ECG, as well as PK, MMTT, lipid and PD biomarker 
labs will be performed (See Sche dule of Activities -SAD). In each SAD cohort, the first 
2subjects will be dosed with either PF -[ADDRESS_1195608] been thoroughly reviewed b y the 
Sponsor and Investigators.

four SAD dose cohorts , a randomized, double -blind ed(Sponsor-open), placebo -controlled, 
multiple ascending dose (MAD) portion will be initiated to evaluate the safety  and 
tolerability  of different dosages and dosing schedules. This portion will be conducted in 
approximatel y 4planned cohorts, 75 mg, 150 mg, 250 mg, and a fourth cohort with dosage 
and regimen to be determined based on the review of the safet y data from the previous 
cohort(s), with a total of up to approximately  40subjects (8PF-06293620: 2 placebo per 
cohort ).  Subjects and the site personnel  in the MAD cohorts will be blinded to treatment and 
treatment regimen .  The MAD cohorts will be run in parallel with the remaining SAD 
cohorts . Based on the ongoing review of the safety data of the previous SAD and MAD 
cohort(s) the order of initiation of the MAD cohorts may  be adjusted. MAD safet y  data 
from the previous cohort(s) will be used to determine the dose and dose regimen of the fourth 
planned cohort . An additional fifth cohort may  bestudied to obtain furthe rsafet y and PK 
data, increasing the planned total number of subjects to approximately  50. At no time will 
the MAD dose exceed PK exposure from the SAD .
The MAD screening period will last up to 42days, the treatment period will last [ADDRESS_1195610] approximatel y 85days(Day s 86-169).  Subjects will be required to 
be on stable, dail y dosages of metformin. Subjects will receive SC administration of study  
drug (PF -06293620 or placebo) every  4 weeks (on study  Days 1, 29 and 57) in 3 of the
currentl y planned 75mg, 150 mg and 250 mgcohorts . 
Subjects will be confined to the CRU prior to dosing (Day  -3) for baseline testing, then will 
receive the first dose of study  drug on Day 1.  Subsequently , multiple PK and safet y 
assessments after dosing will continue in the CRU until discharged on Day 3.  The subjects 
will return to the CRU for subsequent visits at which time safet y assessments, including AE 
monitoring, clinical laboratory  tests, vital signs, and ECG, as well as PK, MMTT, lipid and 
PD biomarker labs will be performed (see Schedule of Activities -MAD). These visits will

The order of MAD cohorts may  be adjusted based on the safet y of the previous cohort(s), but 
at no time will the dose exceed the PK exposure from the SAD portion.   An additional cohort 
may beadded to obtain additional safety  and PK data.
3.2.Planned Number of Subjects
The overall planned number of subjects enrolled is approximatel y 80subjects (approximatel y 
40subjects across the SAD cohorts and approximately  40subjects across the MAD cohorts).  
Table 2and Table 3, above, outline how the s ubjects will be distributed across the cohorts 
and treatments.
3.3.Dose Escalation and Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_705093].  Dose escalation may  be stopped if it is deter mined that the dose or dose 
regimen is deemed not to be tolerable .  This decision will be made after a discussion takes 
place between the [COMPANY_007] study  team and the investigator (s).  The [COMPANY_007] study  team may  not 
overrule the Investigators’ decision to stop dose escalation.  If dose escalation is stopped due 
to any  of these findings, additional cohorts may  receive the same or lower doses of the 
investigational compound. Additional subjects may be added at a dose level to further 
evaluate safet y and/or tolera bility  after discussions between the [COMPANY_007] study team and the 
investigators.
Single Ascending Dose Portion (n=8; 6 active treatment and 2 placebo)
Dose escalation will be terminated based on the following criteria:
Two or more subjects receiving PF-062936 20drug (but not placebo subjects) 
develop similar clinically significant laboratory , ECG or vital signs abnormalities, or 
severe AEs in the same organ class, indicating dose- limiting toxicity  as outlined in

2hypoglycemic events of Common Terminology  Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) Grade  3 which do not meet SAE criteria; see Table 7).
It is determined that the dose is deemed intolerable.   This decision will be made 
following discussions between the Stud y Team and the I nvestigator.
Other findings that, at the discretion of the Stud y Team and Investigator, indicate that dose 
escalation should be halted.
In the single dose cohorts, for an y treatment -related serious adverse event (SAE) , the subject 
will continue with the safety  assessments until completion of the study .
Progression to the next dose will occur if the last dose was well tolerated and after 
satisfactory  review of the available saf ety data.
Multiple Ascending Dose Portion (n= 8PF-06293620 drug : 2 PBO )
For dose escalation, the decision to proceed to a higher dose will be made by  [CONTACT_858107] 80% 
of the subjects in the previous cohort have received one dose and have been followed for 
14days post first dose. Enrollment in the previous cohort must be completed before 
initiating enrollmnet in a new cohort. If 2 subjects in a cohort discont inues the study  prior 
to reaching Day 15, for reasons other than safet y (eg, withdraw of consent ), the subject (s)
will be included in the dose escalation data review and do /does not need to be replaced for 
the purposes of determining dose escalation. The order of MAD regimen cohorts may  
change depending on the ongoing review of safet y/PK data but at no time will doses be 
administered that exceed the PK exposure  determined in the SAD portion. Dose escalation 
will be terminated based on the following crite ria:
Two (2 ) or more subjects receiving PF-06293620 drug (but not placebo subjects) 
develop similar clinically significant laboratory , ECG or vital signs abnormalities, or 
severe AEs in the same organ class, indicating dose- limiting toxicity  as outlined in
Table 3 (Exception: dose escalation will be terminated if one (1) subject experiences 
≥2hypoglycemic events of CTCAE Grade  3which do not meet SAE criteria; see 
Table 7).
The limit of safet y and/or tol erability  has been reached.  
If dose escalation in the single ascending dose is terminated AND the exposure of the 
dose cohort in the multiple ascending dose portion is equal to or higher than the 
exposure of the dose determined to be the MTD after the si ngle doses.

If ALT or AST are increased [ADDRESS_1195611] continues to rise 3 to 5x ULN prior to the next dose, the 
investigator and Sponsor will review the subject’s clinical data p rior to administering 
the next dose and dosing may  be interrupted. 
Dosing will be interrupted in individual subjects when the following occurs:
a.Serum AST or ALT are  increased to 5ULN (CTCAE Grade3); confirmed 
within 7 days(by [CONTACT_858108] l labs) .
b.Confirm creatine kinase (CK) WNL  and source of enzy me elevation is not 
muscle related .
IfALT or AST elevation of 5ULN (CTCAE Grade3) is confirmed, AL T and AST will 
be monitored weekl y until liver enzy mes have returned to WNL  if subject was WNL  at 
baseline ;or to <2xULN if was between 1 – 2xULN at baseline. Once ALT/AST levels have 
returned to WNL if subject was WNL  at baseline; or to <2xULN if was between 1 –2xULN 
at baseline, the results must be confirmed within 7 days (by  [CONTACT_858109]) , at 
which point dosing may  resume as scheduledper protocol. Missed doses will not be made 
up. If dosing is interrupted, all study visits and procedures will continue as per protocol, with 
the exception of dosing and subject will be followe d to the end of the stud y. 
If following the Day [ADDRESS_1195612] elevation , the dosing 
windows for Day 29 or Day 57 may  be extended to 2days to allow for evaluation of 
ALT/AST.

All men who, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], are biologically  capable of having children 
and are sexuall y active, must agree to use a highly effective method of contraception 
consistently  and correctly for the duration of the study  and for at least [ADDRESS_1195623].  The investigator or his/her designee, in consultation with the 
subject, will confirm the subject has selec tedthe most appropriate method of contraception 
for the individual subject and his partner from the permitted list of contraception methods 
(see below) and instruct the subject in its consistent and correct use. Subjects need to affirm 
that they  meet at least one of the selected methods of contraception. The investigator or 
his/her designee will discuss with the subject the need to use highly  effective contraception 
consistently  and correctly  according to the Schedule of Activitie s(SOA) and document such 
conversation in the subject’s chart.   In addition, the investigator or his/her designee will 
instruct the subject to call immediately  if the selected contraception method is discontinued 
or if pregnancy  is known or suspected.
Highly effective male contraception include: male condom WITHa spermicide (ie, foam, 
gel, film, cream or suppository ) and male sterilization with the absence of sperm in the 
post-vasectom y ejaculate. I n addition, males will not donate sperm during and [ADDRESS_1195624] information for the sponsor's appropriately qualified medical personnel for the 
study is documented in the study  contact [CONTACT_4111] .
To facilitate access to appropriatel y qualified medical personnel on study  related medical 
questions or problems, subjects are provided with a contact [CONTACT_1137]. The contact [CONTACT_4662], 
at a minimum, protocol and investigational compound identifiers, subject study  number, 
contact [CONTACT_4663] a nd contact [CONTACT_4664] a help desk in the event 
that the investigational site staff cannot be reached to provide advice on a medical question 
or problem originating from another healthcare professional not involved in the subjects 
participation in the stud y. The help desk number can also be used b y investigational staff if 
they are seeking advice on medical questions or problems, however it should only  be used in 
the event that the established communication pathway s between the investigational site and 
thestudy  team are not available. It is therefore intended to augment, but not replace the 
established communication pathway s between the investigational site and study  team for 
advice on medical questions or problems that may arise during the stud y. The he lp desk 
number is not intended for use b y the subject directly  and if a subject calls that number they  
will be directed back to the investigational site.
5.STUDY TREATMENTS
5.1.Allocation to Treatment
The investigator’s knowledge of the treatment should not infl uence the decision to enroll a 
particular subject or affect the order in which subjects are enrolled.
PF-[ADDRESS_1195625] will receive the study treatment 
regimen assigned to the corresponding randomization number.
Eligible subjects will be randomly  assigned through an Interactive Voice Resp onse Sy stem 
(IVRS) to a study  treatment cohort . Randomization numbers will be assigned by  [CONTACT_21926]. 
Subjects in the SAD portion will be randomized to receive a single -dose of either 
PF-06293620 SC 0. 3mg/kg to 6mg/kg (Cohorts 1 through 4) or placebo, or 
PF-06293620 IV1mg/kg (Cohort 5) or placebo, in a 6:2 ratio PF- 06293620:placebo in all 
cohorts . All subjects will receive PF-06293620 or placebo once in the study treatment period.
Subjects in the MAD portion will be randomized to receive multiple -dosesof either 
PF-06293620 or placebo SC every  4weeks in an 8:2 ratio PF -06293620:placebo .  Based on 
the ongoing review of the safet y data of the previous cohort(s) will be used to determine the 
dose and dose regimen of the fou rthplanned cohort .
5.2.Breaking t he Blind
At the initiation of the study , the study  site will be instructed on the method for breaking the 
blind.  The method will be either a manual or electronic process.  Blinding codes should only  
be broken in emergency  situations for reasons of subject safet y.  Whenever possible, the 
investigator or sub -investigator should consult with a member of the study team prior to 
breaking the blind.  When the blinding code is broken, the reason must be fully  documented 
and entered on the case report form (CRF) /data collection tool (DCT) .
Only  the investigator site(s) and the study  monitor(s) will be blinded to study  treatment.  
[COMPANY_007] personnel will be unblinded to subject treatments in order to permit real -time 
interpretation of the safety and pharmacokinetic da ta; and provide information necessary  to 
potentially  alter the dose escalation sequence.  The study  monitor will remain blinded to 
treatment until all monitoring for the stud y has been completed. To minimize the potential 
for bias, treatment randomization information will be kept confidential b y [COMPANY_007] personnel 
and will not be released to the investigator or investigator site personnel until the study  
database has been locked .
Blood specimens will be obtained from all subjects for pharmacokinetic analy sis to maintain 
the study  blind at the investigator site Specimens from subjects randomized to placebo will 
not be routinely anal yzed.

5.2.4. Administration
Following an overnight fast of least 10 hours , subjects will receive study  medication at 
approximatel y 0800 hours (plus or minus 2hours ).  Qualified and trained investigator site 
personnel will administer study  drug to subjects either by  [CONTACT_22666] (SAD 
Cohort 1- 4 and all MAD Cohorts) to the abdomen, or as a single IV infusion (SAD Cohort 5 
only) by [CONTACT_858113] y 60minutes.  For 
subjects receiving two or more subcutaneous injections, study  drug should be administered to 
two or more different quadrants of the abdomen; one or two inject ions per quadrant.   Study  
staff should refer to the DAI for specific instructions on the handling and administration of 
study  medication.
Subjects should take their metformin according to their usual time schedule and regimen.   On
Day 1 (all SAD and MAD cohorts), and on additional day s where study  drug is administered 
(MAD cohorts onl y) metformin should be taken prior to receiving study  treatment.
Medication errors may  result, in this study , from the administration or consumption of the 
wrong product,by  [CONTACT_1148], at the wrong time, or at the wrong dosage strength .  
Such medication errors occurring to a stud y participant are to be captured on the medication 
error case report form (CRF) which is a specific version of the adverse event (AE) page and 
on the SAE form when appropriate. In the event of medication dosing error, the sponsor 
should be notified immediately .

5.2.5. Compliance
PF-06293620 /placebo will be administered b y appropriatel y trained site personnel in the 
clinic. 
Subjects will self administer metformin during their participation in the study .  On specific 
days(See Schedule of Activities), site personnel will ask subjects the number of doses taken 
since the last visit.   The information will be recorded on the eCRF.
Subjects will be educated on the importance of taking their daily  dosages of metformin 
during the study  period.
5.3. Drug Storage and Drug Accountability 
PF-06293620 active vials should be stored refrigerated at 2-8C.  Storage conditions stated in 
the SRSD ( ie, Investigator Brochure [IB ], Core Data Sheet [CDS] , [LOCATION_002] Package 
Insert [USPI ], Summary of Product Characteristics [SPC] , or Local Product Document 
[LPD])will be superseded by [CONTACT_4671]. 
Investigators and site staff are reminded to check temperatures dail y (ie, manually  or by 
[CONTACT_858114]) on working day s only , and to ensure that 
thermometers are working corre ctly as required for proper storage of investigational 
products.  These include thermometers for both the room storage and refrigerator storage.  
Any temperature excursions should be addressed according to appropriate standard operating 
procedures . 
The investigational product(s) must be stored as indicated.  Deviations from the storage 
requirements, including any  actions taken, must be documented and reported to the sponsor.   
Once a deviation is identified, the investigational product must be quarantined a nd not used 
until the sponsor provides documentation of permission to use the investigational product.
At the end of the stud y,[COMPANY_007] will provide instructions as to disposition of any  unused 
investigational product.  If [COMPANY_007] authorizes destruction a t the study site, the investigator 
must ensure that the materials are destro yed in compliance with applicable environmental 
PF-[ADDRESS_1195626] be adequatel y documented.
5.4.Concomi tant Medication(s)
Sporadic use of an y homeopathics or nutritional supplements should be discouraged as they  
may confound interpretation of study  treatment results.   Subject may  be on dietary  
supplement or herbal medicine as long as dose is stable within [ADDRESS_1195627] be provided to manage AEs.   For medical 
management of h ypogl ycemia (See Section 7.6), the investigator should obtain a blood 
sample for glucose first and then may administer oral carbohy drate, glucagon or IV glucose 
according to medical judgment.   
For the MAD portion of the study , if a subject has sustained high fasting plasma glucose 
concentrations on two consecutive measurements (ie,measured on different day s), based on 
the ra nges below, the investigator should recommend further follow -upand treatme nt.
Fasting Plasma Glucose >270 mg/dL  (15mmol/L) at Week 6.
Fasting Plasma Glucose >240 mg/dL  (13.3 mmol/L) at Week 12.

Note for extended follow -up: Subjects will continue to be monitored , at up to [ADDRESS_1195670] scheduled visit, if necessary , for:
Elevated liver enz ymes:  if a subject had 3xULN elevations in liver enzy mes at an y 
time after the first dose of study  drug , follow -up will continue , bey ond the last 
scheduled visit, at up to 3 –month intervals until enzy mes have returned to:
WNL  if subject was WNL at baseline, or 
<2xULN if was between 1 –2xULN at baseline. 
Elevated glucagon levels (ie, >3 X baseline) and/or presence of treatment -emergent

approximate baseline (ie, 3X baseline) , or if glucagon remains above baseline, no 
further visits are necessary if the glucagon/ADA has stabilized at consecutive visits 
with no related adverse events .(see Section [IP_ADDRESS] for more detai ls).
6.4.Subject Withdrawal (Early Termination)
Subjects may withdraw from the study  at any  time at their own request, or they  may  be 
withdrawn at an y time at the discretion of the investigator or sponsor for safety or, behavioral 
reasons ,or the inability  of the subject to compl y with the protocol required schedule of stud y 
visits or procedures at a given study  site. 
If a subject does not return for a scheduled visit, every  effort should be made to contact [CONTACT_1560].  The Investigator should attempt to cont act the subject twice.  After two attempts, 
CRU staff may  send a registered letter.  If no response is received from the subject, the 
PF-[ADDRESS_1195672]’s medical 
record.   In an y circumstance , every  effort should be made to document subject outcome, if 
possible.  The investigator should inquire about the reason for withdrawal ,request the subject 
to return for a final visit, if applicable, and follow- up with the subject regarding any  
unresolved adverse events (AEs) .
If the subject withdraws from the study  and also withdraws consent for disclosure of future 
information, no further evaluations should be performed an d no additional data should be 
collected.  The sponsor may  retain and continue to use any  data collected before such 
withdrawal of consent.
Subjects who withdraw from the study  may  be replaced at the discretion of the investigator 
upon consultation with th e sponsor provided the nature of the safet y event does not preclude 
dose escalation and exposure stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_638757].
7.ASSESSMENTS
Every  effort should be made to ensure that protocol -required tests and procedures are 
completed as described.  Howeve r, it is anticipated that from time to time there may  be 
circumstances, outside the control of the investigator that may  make it unfeasible to perform 
the test.  I n these cases, the investigator must take all steps necessary  to ensure the safet y and 
well being of the subject.  When a protocol -required test cannot be performed, the 
investigator will document the reason for the missed test and an y corrective and preventative 
actions which s/he has taken to ensure that required processes are adhered to as soon as 
possible.  The study  team must be informed of these incidents in a timely  manner.
7.1. Blood Volume
The t otal blood sampling volume for individual subjects across the entire duration of this 
study (screening, active phase and follow-up) is approximately  490mLfor the SAD cohorts

Page 947.2.2. Physical Examinations
Physical examinations may  be conducted by  a ph ysician, trained ph ysician's assistan t, or 
nurse pract itioner as acceptable according to local regulation.  A complete phy sical 
examination will include head, ears, ey es, nose, mouth, skin, heart and lung examinations, 
lymph nodes, breast (unless subject refuses), gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, and 
neurol ogical s ystems.  The limited or abbreviated phy sical examination will be focused on 
general appearance, the respi[INVESTIGATOR_858094], as well as towards subject 
reported s ymptoms.
7.2.3. Height, Weight and Waist Circumference
Body  height and weight recordings will be measured at times spe cified in Schedule of 
Activities section of this protocol.  Height will be measured in centimeters using a wall 
mounted stadiometer in stocking feet at screening only and carried forwa rd .  Weight will be 
measured in kilograms using a calibrated scale and at approximatel y the same time of day at 
each nominal timepoint.  The weight measurement should be taken with subjects wearing a 
gown (or other standard clothing provided by  [CONTACT_47365]) , undergarments, and socks (no 
shoes), while fasting and after the subject has been asked to void (e .g.empty  bladder). 
Waist circumference will be measured in triplicate at times specified in the Schedule of 
Activities section of this protocol.  The waist circumference measurement should be taken 
with the subject wearing a gown. To measure waist circumference, use a spring- loaded tape 
measure, and starting at the top of the hip bone, bring it all the way  around, level with the 
navel.  Tape measure should not be too tight and parallel with the floor.  Instruct subject to 
not hold their breath. Measurement should not include navel.
7.2.4. Blood Pressure and Pulse Rate
Blood pressure and pulse rate will be measured at times specified in Study  Procedures
section of this protocol.  Additional collection times, or changes to collection times of blood 
pressure and pulse rate will be permitted, as necessary , to ensure appropriate collection of 
safet y data.
Supi[INVESTIGATOR_831807]’s arm supported at the level of the 
heart and recorded to the nearest mm Hg after [ADDRESS_1195675] is defined as quiet 
period with no talking, cellphone, television (TV) etc. until all blood pr essure measurements 
are completed. Subjects should be instructed not to speak during measurements. The same 
arm (preferabl y the non-dominant arm in MAD portion of the study ) will be used throughout 
the study . Blood pressure should not be taken from the arm with a peripheral IV, heplock or 
an intravenous infusion. Subjects should be instructed not to speak during measurements.
The same properl y sized and calibrated blood pressure cuff will be used to measure blood 
pressure each time.  Triplicate measure ments should be conducted at approximately  2minute 
intervals. The use of an automated device for measuring individual BP and pulse rate is
preferred . When using an automated device, all efforts should be made to use the same 
device for each time point. W hen pulse rate is assessed manuall y, itwill be measured in the 
brachial/radial artery  for at least 30 seconds.  When the timing of these measurements 
PF-06293620 
B3501001
Final Protocol Amendment 302 October 2015
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 95coincides with a blood collection, blood pressure and pulse rate should be obtained prior to 
the nomina l time of the blood collection.
7.2.5. Temperature
It is preferred that bod y temperature be collected using the ty mpanic or oral methods and that 
the same method be used consistently  throughout the study .  No eating, drinking or smoking 
is allowed for 15 minutes prior to the measurement .
7.2.6. Electrocardiogram 
Electrocardiograms (E CGs) should be collected at times specified in the Study  Procedures
section of this protocol.
All scheduled ECGs should be performed after the subject has rested quietly  for at least 
[ADDRESS_1195676] leaving the 
clinic .In addition, all ECGs performed in the MAD cohorts will be sent to a central vendor 
for independent review /assessment .Data transferred from the vendor will be assessed as 
Normal, Abnormal, or Not Evaluable ; however interpretation of overall clinical significance 
will be determined b y the I nvestigator. To ensure safet y of the subjects and potent ial 
reporting purposes , a qualified individual at the investigator site will make comparisons to 
baseline measurements.   Since there may  be multiple baseline ECGs, the predominant 
findings observed can be used for the purposes of comparison.  If the QTc in terval is 
increased b y >45 msec from the baseline, or an absolute QTc value is 500msec for an y 
scheduled ECG, then 2 additional ECGs will be collected, approximatel y 2-4minutes apart, 
to confirm the original measurement.  If either of the QTc values fro m these repeated ECGs 
remains above the threshold value (>45 msec from the baseline; or is 500msec), then a 
single ECG must be repeated at least hourl y until QTc values from 2 successive ECGs fall 
below the threshold value that triggered the repeat measu rement. 
In some cases, it may  be appropriate to repeat abnormal ECGs to rule out improper lead 
placement as contributing to the ECG abnormality.  It is important that leads are placed in the 
same positions each time in order to achieve precise ECG recordi ngs.  If a machine -read QTc 
value is prolonged, as defined above, repeat measurements may  not be necessary  if a 
qualified phy sician’s interpretation determines that the QTc values are in the acceptable 
range.
7.2.7. Continuous Cardiac Monitoring by [CONTACT_336258] (SAD Cohorts only)
All abnormal rh ythms will be recorded and reviewed by  [CONTACT_638795].  The time, duration, and description of the clinicall y 
significant event will be recorded in the CRF /DCT .  In addition, a printed record of the 
tracing(s) of the clinically  significant rhy thm(s) will be made and retained with other source 
documents.
PF-[ADDRESS_1195677] and the s ystem connected prior to 
dosing.
7.2.8. Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring (MAD Cohorts Only)
Twenty -four (24) hour ambulatory  blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) will be performed in 
the MAD cohorts, at times specified in the STUDY PROCEDURES section of this protocol.
Blood pressure assessments will be initiated in the AM on scheduled days and will be 
initiat ed at approximately the same time for a subject throughout the duration of the study .
The start/stop time and description of any event s that may  effect blo od pressure (eg ,blood 
pressure medication, meals, sleep) will be recorded in the e CRF.  Blood press ures will 
automatically  be assessed approximatel y ever y 20 minutes between 0600 and 2200 and 
approximatel y ever y 30 minutes between 2200 and 0600 .
Blood pressure readings will be collected using a centralized s ystem that also allows for the 
storage and adv anced analy sis of all recorded data in order to preserve important events for 
future evaluations. All data will be e lectronicall y transferred to a central vendor for th e 
analysis. Ambulatory  blood pressure monitoring wi ll be conducted on Day  -2 to obtain a 
baseline dataset; the baseline dataset will be immediately  uploaded to the central vendor for
technical QC before proceeding with any  Day  -2 procedures.  If the baseline (Day  -2)data 
fails technical QC the baseline (Day  -2) procedure must be repeated starting on Day -1.  
Twenty -four hour ABPM will also be collected beginning on Day 1, at least 1 hour prior to 
study  drug administration ; Day 7, Day 63and then again on Day 84and data will

7.5.Banked Biospecimens
7.5.1. Markers of Drug Response 
Variat ion in genetic markers and other biomarkers may  help to explain some of the 
variability  in response seen with some drugs among different individuals.  This is referred to 
as pharmacogenomic /biomarker research .  Comparing the Deox ynucleic Acid (DNA) , 
Ribonu cleic Acid (RNA) , protein, and metabolite variation patterns of subjects who respond 
well and those who respond poorly  to treatment may  help to better define the most 
appropriate group of subjects in which to target a given treatment. Collecting biospecim ens 
for exploratory  pharmacogenomic /biomarker analy ses and retaining them in the [COMPANY_007] 
BioBank makes it possible to better understand the drug’s mechanism of action and to seek 
explanations for differences in, for example, exposure, efficacy , tolerability , or safet y not 
anticipated prior to the beginning of the study .  Providing these biospecimens is a required 
study  activit y for stud y sites and subjects, unless prohibited as such b y local regulations or 
ethics committee decision
To protect subjects’ confi dentiality , the banked biospecimens and data generated from them 
will be coded with the subject’s study  identification number. Samples will be kept in a 
facility  accessible only  by [CONTACT_195152] -swipe.  Data will be stored on password -protected computer 
systems. The key  between the code and the subject’s personal identifiers will be held at the 
study  site; the researchers using the biospecimens and data generated from them will not 
have access to the key  nor any  personally  identify ing information.   Biospecimens w ill only  
be used for the purposes described here and in the informed consent document/subject
information sheet; an y other uses require additional ethical approval.   Unless a time 
PF-[ADDRESS_1195690] to the investigator, in which event any  remaining biospecimen will be 
destroy ed; data already  generated from the biospecimens will continue to be stored to protect 
the integrity of existing analy ses.  It is ve ry unlikely  that results generated from the 
biospecimens will have any  clinical, diagnostic, or therapeutic implications for the individual 
study  participants.   Subjects are notified in the informed consent document/ subject
information sheet that their res ults will not be given to them, unless required by  [CONTACT_147655], in which case results will be returned via the investigator.   Results will not be 
provided to family  members or other ph ysicians; nor will they  be recorded in the subject’s 
medic al record.  There is no intention to contact [CONTACT_858125] .
A 4mL blood biospecimen Prep D1 (K2EDTA whole blood collection optimized for DNA 
analysis) will be collected at the Day-1visit to be retained for potential 
pharmacogenomic /biomarker analyses related to drug response, unless prohibited by  [CONTACT_168039]. For example, putative safet y biomarkers, drug 
metabolizing enzy me genes, drug transport protein genes, or genes thought to be rel ated to

8.ADVERSE EVENT REPORT ING
8.1.Adverse Events
Adverse events will be collected from t he time a subject signs consent to the last visit. All 
observed or volunteered AEs regardless of treatment group or suspected causal relationship 
to the investigational product(s) will be reported as described in the following sections. 
For all AEs , the investigator must pursue and obtain information adequate both to determine 
the outcome of the AEand to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as a n 
serious adverse event ( SAE ) requiring immediate notification to [COMPANY_007] or its designated 
representative.  For all AEs, sufficient information should be obtained by  [CONTACT_8889].  The investigator is required to assess causality .  
Follow -up by  [CONTACT_168087] a level acceptable to the investigator, and [COMPANY_007] concurs with that assessment.
As part of ongoing safet y reviews conducted b y the Sponsor, an y non -serious adverse event 
that is determined b y the Sponsor to be serious will be re ported by  [CONTACT_14547] a SAE .  To 
assist in the determination of case seriousness further information may  be requested from the 
investigator to provide clarity  and understanding of the event in the context of the clinical 
study . 
8.2.Reporting Period
For SAE s, the active reporting period to [COMPANY_007] or its designated representative begin s from 
the time that the subject provides informed consent, which is obtained prior to the subject’s 
participation in the study ,ie, prior to undergoing any  study -related proced ure and/or 
receiving investigational product, through and including [ADDRESS_1195692] 
after the active reporting period has ended should be reported to the Sponsor if the 
investigator becomes aware of them; at a minimum, all serious events that the investigator 
PF-[ADDRESS_1195693] are 
to be reported to the Sponsor.
Treatment emergent AEs (serious and non -serious) should be recorded on the CRF /DCT
from the time the subject has taken at least one dose of study  treatment through last subject 
visit.
8.3.Definition of an Adverse Event
An AEis an y untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject administered a 
product or medical device; the event need not necessarily  have a causal relationship with the 
treatment or usage.  Examples of AEs include but are not limited to:  
Abnormal test findings;
Clinically  significant symptom s and signs;
Changes in physical examination findings;
Hypersensitivity ;
Progression/worsening of underl ying disease ;
Drug abuse;
Drug dependency .
Additionally , they  may  include the signs or s ymptoms resulting from:
Drug overdose;
Drug withdrawal;
Drug misuse;
Drug interactions;
Extravasation;
Exposure during pregnancy  (EDP);
Exposure via breastfeeding ;
Medication error ;
Occupational exposure.
PF-[ADDRESS_1195694] finding should be reported as 
an AEare as follows: 
Test result is associated with accompan ying symptoms; and/or
Test result requires additional diagnostic testing o r medical/surgical intervention;
and/or
Test result leads to a change in study  dosing or discontinuation from the study , 
significant additional concomitant d rug treatment, or other therap y;and/or
Test result is considered to be an AEby [CONTACT_4687].
Per the sponsor, ALT or AST results  3xUL N are to be reported as AEs along 
with any  clinically  relevant/as sociated sy mptoms .
Merel y repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of an y of the above conditions, does not 
constitute an AE.  An y abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require 
reporting as an AE.
8.5.Serious Adverse Events
AnSAE is any  untoward medical occurrence at any  dose that:
Results in death;
Is life -threatening (immediate risk of death);
Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];
Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity (substantial disruption of the 
ability  to conduct normal life functions);
Results in congenital anomaly /birth defect.
Medical and scientific judgment isexercised in determining whether an event is an important 
medical event.  An important medical event ma y not be immediately life -threatening and/or 
result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  However, if it is determined that the event may  jeopardize 
the subject or may  require intervention to prevent one of the other AEoutcomes, the 
important medical event should be reported as serious.
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency  room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; 
or development of drug dependency  or drug abuse.

Page 1078.5.1. Prot ocol-Specified Serious Adverse Events
There are no protocol -specified SAEs in this study .  All SAEs will be reported by  [CONTACT_134988] y 
database (see Section 8.13.1 SAE Reporting Requirements). 
8.5.2. Potential Cases of Drug- Induced Liver Injury 
Abnormal values in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 
levels concurrent with abnormal elevati ons in total bilirubin level that meet the criteria 
outlined below in the absence of other causes of liver injury  are considered potential cases of 
drug-induced liver injury (potential Hy ’s Law cases) and should alway s be considered 
important medical events. 
The threshold of laboratory  abnormalities for a potential case of drug- induced liver injury  
depends on the subject ’s individual baseline values and underl ying conditions. Subjects who 
present with the following laboratory  abnormalities should be evalu ated further to 
definitively  determine the etiology  of the abnormal laboratory values:
Subjects with AST or ALT and total bilirubin baseline values within the normal range
who subsequently  present with AST or AL T values3times the upper limit of 
normal (X ULN) concurrent with a total bilirubin value 2X ULN with no evidence 
of hemoly sis and an alkaline phosphatase value2X ULN or not available .
For subjects with preexisting AL TOR, AST OR total bilirubin values above the 
upper limit of normal, the foll owing threshold values should be used in the definition 
mentioned above:
For s ubjects with pre -existing AST or AL T baseline values above the normal 
range :AST or ALT values2times the baseline values and [ADDRESS_1195695] , or 
[ADDRESS_1195696] (whichever is smaller).
Conc urrent with
For subjects with pre -existing values of total bilirubin above the normal range: 
Total bilirubin level increased from baseline by  [CONTACT_219911] a least one time 
the upper limit of normal or if value reaches 3times the upper limit of 
normal (whichever is smaller).
The subject should return to the investigational site and be evaluated as soon as possible, 
preferabl y within [ADDRESS_1195697] bilirubin, gamma- glutamy l transferase (GGT) , prothrombin 
time (PT)/ international normaliz ed ratio ( INR),and alkaline phosphatase.  A detailed 
history , including relevant information, such as review of ethanol, acetaminophen , 
recreational drug and supplement consumption, family  history , occupational exposure, sexual 
PF-[ADDRESS_1195698] with a jaundiced person , surgery , blood transfusion, 
history  of liver or allergic disease, and work exposure, should be collected. Further testing 
for acute hepatitis A, B, or C infection and liver imaging ( eg,biliary  tract) may  be warra nted. 
All cases confirmed on repeat testing as meeting the laboratory  criteria defined above , with 
no other cause for liver function test ( LFT) abnormalities identified at the time should be 
considered potential Hy ’s Law cases irrespective of availability of all the results of the 
investigations performed to determine etiology  of the abnormal LFTs. Such potential Hy ’s 
Law cases should be reported as SAEs .
8.6.Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4589] (even less than 24 hours) in a ho spi[INVESTIGATOR_8843].  Admission also 
includes transfer within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4591]/intensive care unit (eg, from the psy chiatric 
wing to a medical floor, medical floor to a coronary  care unit, or neurological floor to a 
tuberculosis unit).  An emergency  room visit does not necessaril y constitute an 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; however, the event leading to the emergency  room visit should be assessed 
for medical importance.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_198298]:
Rehabilitation facilities;
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4593];
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_4594] ( eg,caregiver relief);
Skilled nursing facilities;
Nursing homes;
Same day  surgeries (as outpatient/same day /ambulatory  procedures).
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4595] a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_2505], clinical 
AEis not in itself a nSAE .  Examples include: 
Admission for treatment of a preexisting condition not associated with the 
development of a new AEor with a worsening of the preexisting condition ( eg, for 
work -up of persistent pre- treatment lab oratory abnormality );
Social admission ( eg, subject has no place to sleep);
Administrative admission ( eg,for yearly physical exam ination );
Protocol -specified admission during a study  (eg, for a procedure required by [CONTACT_8896]);

Page 109Optional admission not associated with a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_4596] (eg,for elective 
cosmetic surgery );
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4597] a medical AE;
Pre-planned treatments or surgical procedures .  These should be noted in t he baseline 
documentation for the entire protocol and/or for the individual subject .
Diagnostic and therapeutic non -invasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery , should not 
be reported as AEs.  However, the medical condition for which the procedure wa s performed 
should be reported if it meets the definition of an AE.  For example, an acute appendicitis 
that begins during the AE reporting period should be reported as the AE, and the resulting 
appendectomy  should be recorded as treatment of the AE.
8.7.Sever ity Assessment
Adverse events occurring during this study  will be graded in accordance with the Grade 1 to 
Grade 5 scale presented below. The detailed definitions are in accordance with National 
Cancer Institute Common Terminology  Criteria for Adverse Eve nt (CTCAE) Version 4.03. 
Documentation of AE grading in the source documents and CRF must be consistent with 
provided definitions.
GRADE Clinical Description of Severit y
0 No Change from Normal or Reference Range (This grade is not included in the 
Version 4.03 CTCAE document but may  be used in certain circumstances) .
1 MILD Adverse Event
2 MODERATE Adverse Event
3 SEVERE Adverse Event
4 LIFE -THREATENING consequences; urgent intervention indicated
5 DEATH RELATED TO Adverse Event
Note the distinction between the severit y and the seriousness of an AE.  A severe event is not 
necessarily  an SAE.  For example, a headache may  be severe (interferes significantly  with 
thesubject's usual function) but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of th e 
criteria for SAEs, listed above.
8.8.Causality Assessment
The investigator’s assessment of causalit y must be provided for all AEs (serious and 
non-serious); the investigator must record the causal relationship in the CRF /DCT , as 
appropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the serious adverse reporting 
requirements if applicable.  An investigator’s causality  assessment is the determination of 
whether there exists a reasonable possibility  that the investigational product caused or 
contributed to an AE ; generall y the facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal 
PF-[ADDRESS_1195699] caused the event, then the event will be handled as “related to 
investi gational product” for reporting purposes, as defined b y the Sponsor (see Section on 
Reporting Requirements ).If the investigator's causality  assessment is "unknown but not 
related to investigational product", this should be clear ly documented on study  records. 
In addition, if the investigator determines thatanSAE is associated with study  procedures, 
the investigator must record this causal relationship in the source documents and CRF /DCT , 
as appropriate, and report such an asse ssment in accordance with the SAE reporting 
requirements, if applicable.
8.9.Exposure During Pregnancy
For both unapproved/unlicensed products and for marketed products , an Exposure During 
Pregnancy  (EDP) occurs if:
1. A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or having been 
exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the investigational 
product; or the female becomes, or is found to be pregnant after discontinuing and/or 
being exposed to the investigational product.
An example of environmental exposure would be a case involving direct contact [CONTACT_4490] 
a [COMPANY_007] product in a pregnant woman (eg, a nurse reports that she is pregnant and has 
been exposed to chemotherapeutic products).
2. A male has been exposed ( eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the 
investigational product prior to or around the time of conception and/or is exposed 
during his partner’s pregnancy .
If a stud y subject or study subject’s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the 
study subject’s treatment with the investigational product, the investigator must submit this 
information to the [COMPANY_007] Drug Safet y Unit on a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Report Form 
and Exposure During Pregnancy (EDP) supplemental form, regardless of whether an SAE 
has occurred.  In addition, the investigator must submit information regarding environmental 
exposure to a [COMPANY_007] product in a pregnant woman ( eg,a subject reports that she is pregnant 
and has been exposed to a cy totoxic product b y inhalation or spi[INVESTIGATOR_4598]) using the EDP 
Supplemental Form.  This must be done irrespective of whether an AEhas occurred and 
within 24 hours of awareness of the exposure .  The information submitted should include the 
anticipated date of delivery  (see below for information rel ated to termination of pregnancy ).
Follow -up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy  and its outcome  for 
all EDP reports with an unknown outcome.  The investigator will follow the pregnancy  until 
completion or until pregnancy  terminati on and notify  [COMPANY_007] of the outcome as a follow up to 
the initial EDP supplemental Form.  In the case of a live birth, the structural integrity  of the 
neonate can be assessed at the time of birth.  In the event of a termination, the reason(s) for 
terminati on should be specified and, if clinicall y possible, the structural integrity  of the 
PF-06293620 
B3501001
Final Protocol Amendment 302 October 2015
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 111terminated fetus should be assessed b y gross visual inspection (unless pre -procedure test 
findings are conclusive for a congenital anomal y and the findings are reported).
If the outcome of the pregnancy  meets the criteria for an SAE (ie,ectopic pregnancy , 
spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise , neonatal death, or congenital anomal y [in a
live born baby, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise or aneonatal death]), the 
investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs .
Additional information about pregnancy  outcomes that are reported as SAEs follows: 
“Spontaneous abortion” includes miscarriage and missed abortion;
Neonatal deaths that occur with in 1month of birth should be reported, without regard 
to causality , as SAEs .  In addition, infant deaths after [ADDRESS_1195700].
Additional information regarding the EDP may be requested by  [CONTACT_093].  Further 
follow -up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case- by-case basis (eg, follow -up on 
preterm infants to identify developmental delay s).In the case of paternal exposure, the 
investigator will provide the study  subject with the Pregnancy  Partner Release of Information 
Form to deliver to his partner. The Investigator must document in the source documents that 
the subject was given the Pre gnancy  Partner Release of Information Form to provide to his 
partner .
8.10. Occupational Exposure
An occupational exposure occurs when during the performance of job duties, a person 
(whether a healthcare professional or otherwise) gets in unplanned direct contac t with the 
product, which may  or may  not lead to the occurrence of an adverse event.
An occupational exposure is reported to the drug safet y unit within 24 hours of the 
Investigator’s awareness, using the SAE Report form, regardless of whether there is an 
associated AE/SAE.  Since the information does not pertain to a subject enrolled in the study , 
the information is not reported on a Case Report Form (CRF), however a copy  of the 
completed SAE Report form is maintained in the investigativesite file.
8.11. W ithdra wal Due to Adverse Events
Withdrawal due to AEshould be distinguished from withdrawal due to other causes , 
according to the definition of AEnoted earlier, and recorded on the appropriate AE
CRF /DCT page.
When a subject withdraws because of anSAE , the SAE must be reported in accordance with 
the reporting requirements defined below.
PF-[ADDRESS_1195701] be made 
immediately , irrespective of the exten t of available AEinformation.  This timeframe also 
applies to additional new information (follow- up) on previously  forwarded SAE reports as 
well as to the initial and follow- up reporting of exposure during pregnancy ,exposure via 
breastfeeding and occupat ional exposure cases. 
In the rare event that the investigator does not become aware of the occurrence of a nSAE
immediately  (eg, if an outpatient study  subject initially  seeks treatment elsewhere), the 
investigator is to report the event within [ADDRESS_1195702] awareness of the AE.
For all SAE , the investigator is obligated to pursue and provide information to [COMPANY_007] in 
accordance with the timeframes for reporting specified above.  In addition, an inve stigator 
may be requested by  [CONTACT_4695] -up information in an 
expedited fashion.  This information collected for SAEs ismore detailed than that captured 
on the AE CRF /DCT .  In general, this will include a description of the AEin sufficient detail 
to allow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independent determination of 
possible causality .  Information on other possible causes of the event, such as concomitant 
medications, vaccines, and/orillnesses must be pro vided.  I n the case of a subject death, a 
summary of available autopsy  findings must be submitted as soon as possible to [COMPANY_007] or its 
designated representative. 
8.13.2. Non-Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements
All AEs will be reported on the AEpage(s) of the CRF /DCT .  It should be noted that the 
form for collection of SAE information is not the same as the AECRF /DCT .  Where the 
same data are collected, the forms must be completed in a consistent manner.  For example, 
the same AE term should be used on b oth forms.  AEshould be reported using concise 
medical terminology  on the CRFs/DCTs as well as on the form for collection of SAE
information.

9. DATA ANALYSIS/STATIS TICAL METHODS
Detailed methodolog y for summary  and statistical anal yses of the data collected in this study  
will be documented in a Statis tical Analy sis Plan, which will be maintained by  [CONTACT_456].  
This document may  modify  the plans outlined in the protocol; however, any  major 
modifications of the primary  endpoint definition and/or its analy sis will also be reflected in a

9.1.Sample Size Determination
This study  is exploratory  in nature; no pre -planned hy pothesis testing is to be performed. 
The sample size determination is not based on statistical power considerations.  Dose cohort 
size in the SAD portion is generall y 8subjects with a 6:2 ratio of active drug to placebo in a 
randomized manner and generally 10 subjects with a 8:2 ratio of active drug to placebo in a 
randomized manner in the MAD portion. Additional subjects may  be added at a dose level to 
further evaluate s afety and/or tolerability after discussions between the [COMPANY_007] study team and 
the investigators.

The serum PK parameters for RN 909(PF-06293620) will be summarized descriptivel y by 
[CONTACT_858128] .  Serum concentrations will be listed and summarized 
descriptivel y by [CONTACT_2715], nominal PK sampling time and route of administration.  I ndividual 
subject, summary  profiles (mean and median plots) of the serum conce ntration -time data will 
be plotted by  [CONTACT_858103].  For summary  statistics and summary  plots, 
the nominal PK sampling time will be used.  For individual subject plots, the actual PK

Page 116Absolute bioavailability  (F) will be estimated as the ratio of dose -normalized adjusted 
geometric means for SC and IV for AUC lastand AUC inf.  Dose -normalized natural log 
transformed AUC inf(data permitting) and AUC lastwill be anal yzed using a mixed ef fect 
model with treatment as fixed effects and subject as a random effect using a one -way 
analysis of variance (ANOVA). Estimates of the adjusted mean differences (Test- Reference) 
and corresponding 90% confidence intervals will be obtained from the model. The adjusted 
mean differences and 90% confidence intervals for the differences will be exponentiated to 
provide estimates of the ratio of adjusted geometric means (Test/Reference) and 90% 
confidence intervals for the ratios. SC doses are the Test treatments, and IV is the Reference 
treatment.
Subjects having positive ADAs will be anal yzed separately  to assess the effects of ADAs on 
RN909(PF-06293620) concentrations. If there is no effect on the concentration versus time 
profiles, then these subjects wi ll be included in the descriptive statistics of concentrations and 
PK parameters.
9.4.Pharmacodynamic Analysis 
PD biomarker data will include fasting plasma glucose, fasting glucagon, fasting GL P-1, 
24-hr glucose profile (finger- stick), HbA1c, fructosamine, 1,5-anhydroglucitol , post prandial 
glucose ,insulin, C-peptide,  glucagon and GL P-1AUC after mixed meal tolerance test (MMTT, 
4hr)as well as mean dai ly glucose (MDG) .
The relationship between changes in the values of these biomarkers with the 
pharmaco kinetics of RN909(PF-06293620 )will be explored.  
In order to minimize the impact of a single ab errant measurement to the baseline, where 
feasible, the baseline is defined as the average of at least two measrements prior to the first 
study  drug administr ation as outlined in the statistical anal ysis plan.  
9.5.Safety Analysis
All safet y data anal ysis will be performed on the safet y analysis set, which includes all 
enrolled subjects who receive at least one dose of study  medication.
Adverse events, ECGs, blood pressure, pulse rate, continuous cardiac monitoring (SAD 
only), ambulatory  blood pressure monitoring (MAD cohorts only ), and safety  laboratory  data 
will be reviewed and summarized on an ongoing basis during the study  to evaluate the safet y 
of subjects.  A ny clinical laboratory , ECG, BP, and PR abnormalities of potential clinical 
concern will be described.  Safety  data will be presented in tabular and/or graphical format 
and summarized descriptively , where appropriate.
Medical history and ph ysical exam information collected during the course of the study  will 
be captured for inclusion into the study  database, unless otherwise noted.  Any untoward 
findings identified on physical exam conducted after the administration of the first dose of 
study  medication will be captured as an adverse event, if those findings meet the definition of 
an adverse event. Data collected at Screening that is used solely for inclusion/exclusion 
criteria, such as laboratory  data, ECGs and vital signs will be considered source data, a nd

screening ph ysical exam is a comprehensive exam and will be captured in the study  database 
as the baseline exam) .  Demographic data collected at Screening will be included in the study  
database.
Summary  statistics and data listings will be provided for the following endpoints:
Incidence of dose limiting or intolerable treatment related adverse events (AEs) .
Incidence, severity  and causal relationship of treatment e mergent AEs (TEAEs) .
Incidence of abnormal laboratory  findings (clinical chemistry , hematology  and 
urinaly sis).
Changes from baseline in safet y laboratory  assessments .
Abnormal and clinicall y relevant changes in vital signs, BP, and ECG parameters.
Inciden ce of anti -drug-antibodies (ADA).
9.5.1. Electrocardiogram (ECG) Analysis
ECG results will be reviewed b y investigators in both the SAD and MAD portion of the 
study . In addition, all ECGs in the MAD portion will undergo central review . The anal ysis 
of ECG resul ts will be based on subjects with baseline (Day 1pre-dose) and on- treatment 
ECG data.  ECG data will be summarized for heart rate (HR) and RR, PR, QRS and QT 
intervals by  [CONTACT_2715].
Post dose ECGs will be compared to the Day 1pre-dose ECG for each subject, an d any 
clinically  significant changes will be recorded as adverse events and evaluated further, as 
clinically  warranted.
Descriptive statistics (n, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum) will be 
used to summarize the absolute QTcF value and changes from baseline in QTcF after 
treatment b y treatment group (each RN 909dose and placebo), and by  [CONTACT_7206]. For each 
subject and dose, the maximum change from baseline will be calculated as well as the 
maximum post -baseline value across time -point s. Outlier anal ysis of the QTcF data will be 
conducted and summarized as follows:
The number of subjects with maximum change from baseline in QTcF (<30, 30 -60, 
and 60ms).
The number of subjects with maximum post -dose (post -baseline) QTcF (<450, 
450-<480 , 480 -<500, and ≥500 ms).
Changes from baseline for the ECG parameters QT interval, heart rate, QTc interval, 
PR interval and QRS interval will be summarized by  [CONTACT_22841].

CTCAE Grade as well as tables of ECG abnormality  at baseline (y es, no, not done: (n, %)). 
Subjects experiencing clinically -relevant morphological ECG changes will be summarized 
(including frequency  and percentage).
The effect of drug concentrations on QTcF change from baseline may  be explored 
graphicall y.  Additional concentration- QTcF anal yses may be performed.
In addition, the number of subjects with corrected and uncorrected QT values [ADDRESS_1195707] dose (for example, triplicate 
ECGs), the mean of the replicate measurements will be used to represent a single observation 
at that time point.  I f any of the three individual ECG tracings has a QTc value 500msec, 
but the mean of the triplicates is not 500msec, the data from the subject’s individual tracing 
will be described in a safety  section of the study  report in order to place the 500msec value 
in appropriate clinical context.  However, values from individua l tracings within triplicate 
measurements that are 500 msec will not be included in the categorical analy sis unless the
average from th etriplicate measurements is also 500msec. 
In addition, an attempt will be made to explore and characterize the relat ionship between 
plasma concentration and QT interval length using a PK/PD modeling approach.  If a PK/PD 
relationship is found, the impact of subject factors (covariates) on the relationship will be 
examined.
9.6. Exploratory Analyses
Exploratory  anal yses will be conducted for SAD and MAD, respectivel y. The individual 
subject’s change and percentage change from baseline for PD biomarkers over the period of 
the study  will be tabulated by [CONTACT_11877].  The mean change from baseline values 
over time per dos e group will also be tabulated.  Data will be presented in tabular and/or 
graphical format and summarized descriptively .  Placebo subjects will be pooled across all 
dose cohorts for the respective stages of the study, ie ,SAD placebo subjects and MAD 
place bo subjects. To explore the treatment effect16 , the mean change and percent agechange 
from baseline over time with active treatment will be compared to the mean change and 
percent change from baseline over time with placebo treated subjects.  Descriptive statistics 
on change and percent agechange from baseline in fasting plasma glucose, post prandial 
glucose ,insulin, C-peptide and glucagon AUC after mixed meal tolerance test (MMTT,

Exploratory  PK/PD analy ses may  be conducted on relevant safet y and PD endpoints as 
permitted by  [CONTACT_26739] .
Data listings will be produced b y stud y portion (SAD or MAD), subject, dose cohorts, visit 
date, and time.
9.7. Interim Analysis
A planned interim anal ysis may be performed at the completion of the SAD portion of the 
study .  The interim anal ysis result will be used for internal business decisions regarding 
future project planning. Data from the SAD portion of the study  may be reported in an 
interim clinical study  report (CSR) should the Sponsor determine an interim report is 
warranted.  The SAD is a double -blind (sponsor unblind ed; subjects and Investigator 
blinded) portion.  All analysis will be descriptive in nature.  Summary  tables and data listings 
will be generated. Detailed anal ysis and summary will be described in a separate Interim 
Analy sis Plan .

This study  will not use aData Monitoring Committee (E -DMC) or Internal Review 
Committee .
10.QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE
During study  conduct, [COMPANY_007] or its agent will conduct periodic monitoring visits for studies 
conducted outside of [COMPANY_007] Clinical Research Units, toensure that the protocol and Good 
Clinical Practices ( GCPs) are being followed.  The monitors may review source documents 
to confirm that the data recorded on CRFs /DCTs is accurate.  The investigator and institution 
will allow Pfi zer monitors/auditors or its agents and appropriate regulatory  authorities direct 
access to source documents to perform this verification.
For studies conducted at [COMPANY_007] Clinical Research Units, the Clinical Research Unit staff will 
perform qualit y contro l checks regularl y during the study to ensure the protocol and Good 
Clinical Practices (GCPs) are being followed.
The study  site may  be subject to review by  [CONTACT_4707] (IRB)/ Independent 
Ethics Committee (IEC), and/or to quality  assuranc e audits performed b y [COMPANY_007], or 
companies working with or on behalf of [COMPANY_007], and/or to inspection by  [CONTACT_36550].
For studies conducted outside of the [COMPANY_007] Clinical Research Units, it is important that the 
investigator(s) and th eir relevant personnel are available during the monitoring visits and 
possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the process.

11.1. Case Report Forms/ Data Collection Tools/ Electronic Data Record
As use d in this protocol, the term CRF /DCT should be understood to refer to either a paper 
form or an electronic data record or both, depending on the data collection method used in 
this study , and for studies conducted at [COMPANY_007] Clinical Research Units the term CRF /DCT
will also refer to the use of PI [INVESTIGATOR_46427] (Phase 1 Management Sy stem).
A CRF/DCT is required and should be completed for each included subject.  The completed 
original CRFs/DCTs are the sole propert y of [COMPANY_007] and should not be made available in an y 
form to third parties, except for authorized representatives of [COMPANY_007] or appropriate regulatory  
authorities, without written permission from [COMPANY_007].
The investigator has ultimate responsibility  for the collection and reporting of all clinical, 
safet y and labo ratory  data entered on the CRFs/DCTs and an y other data collection forms 
(source documents) and ensuring that they  are accurate, authentic / original, attributable, 
complete, consistent, legible, timely  (contemporaneous), enduring and available when 
requir ed.  The CRFs /DCTs must be signed by [CONTACT_674065] /DCTs is true. Any corrections to 
entries made in the CRFs /DCTs, source documents must be dated, initialed and explained (i f 
necessary ) and should not obscure the original entry .
In most cases the source documents are the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_110258]'s chart.  I n these cases, 
data collected on the CRFs /DCTs must match those charts. 
In some cases, the CRF /DCT may also serve as the source document.  In these cases, a 
document should be available at the investigator’s site as well as at [COMPANY_007] and clearl y identify 
those data that will be recorded in the CRF /DCT , and for which the CRF /DCT will stand as 
the source document.  For studi es conducted at [COMPANY_007] Clinical Research Units, the CRF /DCT
is the source document, and will remain at the Clinical Research Unit. If other source 
documents are utilized at the CRUs, those documents will be retained per [COMPANY_007] 
requirements.
11.2. Record Retenti on
To enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory  authorities or [COMPANY_007], the investigator 
agrees to keep records, including the identity  of all participating subjects (sufficient 
information to link records, e. g.CRFs /DCTs and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]), all o riginal signed 
informed consent documents, copi[INVESTIGATOR_573273]/DCTs, safet y reporting forms, so urce 
documents, and detailed records of treatment disposition, and adequate documentation of 
relevant correspondence ( eg,letters, meeting minutes, telephone call s reports).  The records 
should be retained b y the investigator according to International Conference on 
Harmonisation (ICH), local regulations, or as specified in the Clinical Study  Agreement
(CSA) , whichever is longer.
If the investigator becomes unable for any  reason to continue to retain study records for the 
required period ( eg, retirement, relocation), [COMPANY_007] should be prospectivel y notified.  The 
PF-[ADDRESS_1195710] obtain [COMPANY_007]'s written permission before disposing of an y records,

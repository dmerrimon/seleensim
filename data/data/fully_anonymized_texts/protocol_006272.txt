Statistical methods Relative bioavailability of 40 mg/ 0.4 ml BI 695501 formulation (Test, T) 
compared to 40 mg/ 0.8 ml of BI 695501 formulation (Reference, R) will be estimated by [CONTACT_656812] (T/R) for the primary endpoints. Additionally, their two-sided 90% confidence intervals (CIs) will be provided. 
This method corresponds to the two one-sided t-test procedure, each at a 5% 
significance level. Since the main focus is on estimation and not testing, a formal hypothesis test and associated acceptance range is not specified. The statistical model will be an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) on the logarithmic scale including effects for ‘treatment’, ‘location of trial medication injection’ and 
‘baseline body weight’. CIs will be calculated based on the residual error from 
the ANCOVA.
Descriptive statistics will be calculated for all endpoints.

1.1 MEDICAL BACKGROUND
The biologic tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists, including the human monoclonal 
antibody (mAb) adalimumab (Humira®, Abbott), are generally preferred as first-line biologic 
therapy. Tumor necrosis factor is a naturally occurring cytokine that is involved in normal inflammatory and immune responses. Humira® (adalimumab) was first launched in 2002 for the treatment of active moderately toseverely active rheumatoid arthritis. As of February 2019, Humira® is approved for many indications ( R18-2637 , R19-0075 ) in the US and EU
1.2 DRUG PROFILE
BI 695501 is a monoclonal antibody, developed and approved as a biosimilar to the TNF-
alpha blocker Humira® under the trade name [CONTACT_656843]®. The marketing authorisation application and aBLA seeking registration of Cyltezo® as a biosimilar to Humira®(adalimumab) were submitted to US FDA in October 2016, and the FDA approved it on 25 Aug 2017 ( R17-4157 ).
Adalimumab is a recombinant human monoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig) GI antibody specific 
to human TNF-alpha. Humira binds specifically to TNF-alpha (and not TNF-beta) and blocks its interaction with the TNF receptors, TNFR1 and TNFR2. It has human derived heavy and light chain variable regions and human IgG1:k constant regions and is produced in a mammalian expression system ( R18-2637 , R19-0075 ).
The preclinical studies that support the clinical program included: 
!A comparative 5-week toxicology trial w ith an 8-week recovery in cynomolgus 
monkeys comparing BI 695501 and Humira. There was no difference in systemic exposure between BI 695501 and Humira with repeated dosing. This trial demonstrated the similarity of the toxicology profile for BI 695501 and Humira.
!A single dose pharmacokinetic (PK), subcutaneous (s.c.) trial in cynomolgus monkeys 
comparing BI 695501 to Humira. There were no differences in the exposure or 
antidrug antibody (ADA) response in cynomolgus monkeys to BI 695501 and Humira.
!A comparative human tissue cross-reactivity trial of BI 695501 and Humira. This trial 
showed that the patterns of staining of BI 695501 and Humira were similar with minor differences attributable to section to section variation, rather than any true staining differences. All of the tissue cross-reactivity staining was consistent with reported sites of TNF expression and/or previously reported sites of reference product cross-reactivity.
!A determination of the potential other cytokines to bind to BI [ADDRESS_884878] of these cytokines on the binding of TNF between BI 695501and Humira.

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_884879]-13 (7 0) / Saved on: 22 Jun 2021!The potential for BI 695501 to induce in vitro cytokine release or directly activate 
complement compared to Humira. The results from this trial demonstrated that 
BI 695501 and Humira are not anticipated to induce cytokine release in humans and do not directly activate complement.
!An irritation potential trial in rabbits with BI [ADDRESS_884880] been treated with BI 695501 in 4 phase I studies 
investigating single administrations of BI 695501 (408) or Humira (342) ( U13-1096-01 , 
c03070713 , c08933656 , c15874906 ). There were no notable differences between BI [ADDRESS_884881] to safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity.
Overall, the adverse events (AEs) seen in healthy subject trials were in line with the known safety profile of Humira ( R18-2637 , R19-0075 ).
A total of [ADDRESS_884882] been treated with BI 695501 including patients with RA, 
Crohn´s disease and plaque psoriasis.Overall, the safety profile of BI 695501 observed in the clinical trials is considered similar toand consistent with the known safety profile of Humira
®. The trials showed that BI 695501 
and Humira are highly similar in terms of efficacy over a treatment duration up to 48 weeks.The results of the immunogenicity assessment across trials demonstrated a comparable immunogenicity profiles.
Cyltezo® is approved for the following indications in the US:
!Rheumatoid arthritis
!Juvenile idiopathic arthritis
!Axial spondyloarthritis
!Psoriatic arthritis
!Crohn’s disease
!Paediatric Crohn's disease
!Psoriasis
!Paediatric plaque psoriasis

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_884885]-13 (7 0) / Saved on: 22 Jun [ZIP_CODE].3 RATIONALE FOR PERFORMING THE TRIAL
BI 695501 is being developed in two different formulations, 50 mg/mL per 0.8 mL solution 
for injection (current formulation) and 100 mg/mL per 0.4 mL solution for injection (HCLF), both containing the same amount of the drug product - [ADDRESS_884886] (40 mg BI 695501, 100 mg/ml, 0.4 ml) compared to the reference product (40 mg BI 695501, 50 mg/ml, 0.8 ml) is to be investigated.Additionally, clinical data to support the safety, including  and local tolerability will be evaluated. 
1.4 BENEFIT - RISK ASSESSMENT
1.4.1 Benefits
Participation in this trial is without any (therapeutic) benefit for healthy subjects. Their 
participation in the trial, however, is of major importance to the development of the BI 695501 lower volume formulation to be used for patient’s treatment. The subjects are exposed to the risks of the trial procedures and the risks related to the exposure to the trial medication.
1.4.2 Risks
Subjects are exposed to risks of trial procedures and risks related to the exposure to the trial 
medication.
Procedure-related risks
The use of an indwelling venous catheter for the purpose of blood sampling may be 
accompanied by [CONTACT_151807], in rare cases, by [CONTACT_656814]. In addition, in rare cases a nerve might be injured while inserting the venous catheter, potentially resulting in paresthesia, reduced sensibility, and/or pain for an indefinite period. The same risks apply to venepuncture for blood sampling.The total volume of blood withdrawn during the entire trial per subject will not exceed the volume of a normal blood donation (500 mL). No health-related risk to healthy subjects is expected from this blood withdrawal.The needle cap on the prefilled syringe contains dry natural rubber. In rare cases this may cause severe allergic reactions. However, since the injection will be performed by [CONTACT_656815], the risks will be minimized. Subjects with a known history of allergic reactions will not be included into the trial. 
Drug-related risks and safety measuresAdalimumab (BI 695501 (Cyltezo®), Humira) has a generally favorable clinical safety 
profile, and is not associated with AEs that would suggest a high risk to subjects participating in this trial. In patients treated with Humira, most common adverse reactions (incidence >10%) include infections (e.g. upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], sinusitis), injection site reactions, headache 
Boehringer Ingelheim 26 Nov 2021
BI Trial No.: 1297-0015c36797272-01 Trial Protocol Page 16 of 63
Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_884887]-13 (7 0) / Saved on: 22 Jun 2021and rash, abdominal pain, musculoskeletal pain, nausea and vomiting. Allergic reactions (e.g. allergic rash, anaphylactoid reaction, fixed drug reaction, non-specified drug reaction, urticaria) have been observed in approximately 1% of patients.
Cases of hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation have been reported in patients receiving anti 
TNF therapy. Some cases have been fatal, the majority of which were in patients concomitantly receiving other immunosuppressive medications.
Tuberculosis (TB) reactivation or new TB infections have been observed in patients receiving 
Humira and other TNF-inhibitors, including patients who had previously received treatment for latent or active TB.To avoid a risk of reactivating TB and other infections, TB tests (interferon-gamma release assay [IGRA]), Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (qualitative), Hepatitis B Antibody (qualitative), Hepatitis C Antibodies (qualitative), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 and HIV-2 Antibody (qualitative) will be performed prior to dosing to exclude subjects tested positive. Risk to subjects will also be minimized in this trial by [CONTACT_656816]. 
In the controlled portions of clinical trials of some TNF-inhibitors, including Humira, more 
cases of malignancies have been observed among TNF-inhibitor-treated adult patients compared to control-treated adult patients when treated with multiple doses. However, the possible risk for the development of malignancies cannot be excluded. 
Further information regarding relevant contraindications, special precautions, adverse 
reactions and other recommendations for the use of US-licensed Humira and EU-approved Humira are described in the prescribing information ( R18-2637 , R19-0075 ). 
The PK similarity of BI 695501 to US-licensed and EU-approved Humira was established 
(c03070713 ). Additionally, there were no notable differences with respect to safety, 
tolerability and immunogenicity between groups and the dose of [ADDRESS_884888] incidence in the 108 subjects who received BI 695501 in trial 1297.8 was headache (25 subjects, 23.1%), followed by [CONTACT_383011][INVESTIGATOR_6014] (19 subjects, 17.6%). However, there was no difference in the AE profile between BI 695501 to US licensed and EU-approved Humira®. There were no clinically relevant findings with respect to clinical laboratory evaluation, vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs), or injection site reactions.
The subjects will be kept in a Phase I unit for 24 hours after trial medication administration 
for safety evaluations and blood samples draws. A careful clinical examination will be performed before the subjects are discharged from the clinic, during the trial and at the end of trial visit.
Subjects will be followed up during outpatient ambulatory visits. The ambulatory visits will 
occur on Days 1-8, 10, 15, 22, 29, 36, 43 and 57 (End-of-Treatment [e.o.t.]) and will allow for collection of safety signs and symptoms that may occur or arise following trial treatment. Adverse events, body temperature, vital signs, ECGs and safety laboratories as well as

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_884889]-13 (7 0) / Saved on: 22 Jun 2021 will be monitored at different time points during the trial. During the long 
term safety follow-up period all AEs, regardless of relatedness, will be collected until 10 weeks after the administration of trial medication.
Although rare, a potential for drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is under constant surveillance 
by [CONTACT_23274]. Therefore, this trial requires timely detection, evaluation, and follow-up of laboratory alterations in selected liver laboratory parameters to ensure subjects´ safety.In addition, hypersensitivity reactions, anaphylaxis, and serious infections are considered as adverse events of special interest (AESI), see Section [IP_ADDRESS].4 .
Based upon preclinical and clinical information available to date, healthy subjects in this trial 
will not be exposed to undue safety risks.
1.4.3 Discussion
The nature of the target and the mechanism of action of BI 695501 is well understood.
In the context of the unmet medical need and anticipated benefit of BI 695501, the benefit 
risk evaluation of the compound, based upon the available preclinical and clinical information, is favourable.
Considering the medical need for the development of a better tolerated and more effective 
treatment for patients with BI 695501, the expected benefit outweighs the potential risks.

3.1 OVERALL TRIAL DESIGN
The trial will be performed as a randomized, single-dose, double blind, parallel arm trial in 
healthy male and female subjects aged ∀18 to #[ADDRESS_884893] 190 subjects for the primary analysis. Subjects will be randomly assigned to receive one dose of either BI 695501 40 mg/0.4 mL (T) or BI 695501 40 mg/0.8 mL (R). All study drugs will be administered by [CONTACT_22666].
The trial will consist of a Screening period of up to a maximum of [ADDRESS_884894] will then return to the clinic for 13 ambulatory visits on Days 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 15, 22, 29, 36, 43 and 57 (e.o.t.).
Additionally, all AEs, regardless of relatedness, will be collected until 10 weeks after the 
administration of trial medication. Adverse events not fully resolved at the Safety Follow-up visit will be followed until recovery or in case of persistency, sufficient characterization has been achieved and the investigator and medical monitor agree to not pursue them further.An overview of all relevant trial activities is provided in the Flow Chart . For visit schedule 
and details of trial procedures at selected visits, refer to Sections 6.1and 6.2, respectively.
3.2 DISCUSSION OF TRIAL DESIGN, INCLUDING THE CHOICE OF 
CONTROL GROUP
This is a 14-week, double blind, randomized, single dose, parallel arm trial to investigate and 
compare the PK, safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of two formulations of BI 695501 administered subcutaneously via prefilled syringe.
Due to the long half-life of BI 695501, a parallel group design was selected, with 
administration of BI 695501 as a single dose only. Additionally, randomization minimizes selection bias between the treatment groups.
The trial endpoints are derived from measurement of plasma concentrations of the analyte 
provided by a bioanalytical laboratory which is blinded to treatment allocation.
The group size of up to 100 subjects per treatment group is considered adequate for an 
evaluation of the PK, safety, tolerability, .
3.3 SELECTION OF TRIAL POPULATION
It is planned that 200 healthy male and female  subjects will enter the trial. They will be 
recruited from the volunteers' pool of the trial sites.
A log of all subjects enrolled into the trial (i.e. who have signed informed consent) will be 
maintained in the ISF, irrespective of whether they have been treated with investigational drug or not.

3.3.4 Withdrawal of subjects from treatment or assessments
Subjects may withdraw or may be removed from trial treatment or may withdraw consent to 
trial participation as a whole (‘withdrawal of consent’) with very different implications; please see Sections [IP_ADDRESS] and [IP_ADDRESS] below.
If a subject is removed from or withdraws from the trial prior to the first administration of 
trial medication, the data of this subject will not be entered in the case report form (CRF) and will not be reported in the clinical trial report (CTR).
If a subject is removed from or withdraws from the trial after the first administration of trial 
medication, this will be documented and the reason for discontinuation must be recorded in the CRF; in addition, trial data will be included in the CRF and will be reported in the CTR. 
Following removal or withdrawal, a complete end-of-trial examination should be performed.
If the discontinuation or withdrawal occurs before the end of the REP (see Section 1.2.[ADDRESS_884902].
[IP_ADDRESS] Withdrawal from trial treatmentAn individual subject will be withdrawn from trial treatment if:1. The subject wants to withdraw from trial treatment. The subject will be asked to explain 
the reasons but has the right to refuse to answer
2. The subject has repeatedly shown to be non-compliant with important trial procedures 
and, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_15566], the investigator and sponsor representative, the safety of the subject cannot be guaranteed as he / she is not willing or able to adhere to the trial requirements in the future.
3. The subject needs to take concomitant medication that interferes with the investigational 
medicinal product or other trial treatment
4. The subject can no longer receive trial treatment for medical reasons (such as pregnancy,
surgery, adverse events (AEs), or diseases)
5. The subject has an elevation of AST and/or ALT ≥3-fold ULN and an elevation of total 
bilirubin ≥2-fold ULN (measured in the same blood sample) and/or needs to be followed 
up according to the DILI checklist provided in the ISF
In addition to these criteria, the investigator may discontinue subjects at any time based on 
his or her clinical judgment.
If new efficacy or safety information becomes available, Boehringer Ingelheim will review 
the benefit-risk-assessment and, if needed, pause or discontinue the trial treatment for all subjects or take any other appropriate action to guarantee the safety of the trial subjects.

[IP_ADDRESS] Discontinuation of the trial by [CONTACT_35949] a particular trial 
site at any time for any of the following reasons (if reasons 4 and/or 5 are met, the trial should be discontinued immediately):
1. Failure to meet expected enrolment goals overall or at a particular trial site
2. The sponsor decides to discontinue the further development of the investigational 
products
3. Deviation from GCP, or the CTP impairing the appropriate conduct of the trial4. New toxicological findings, serious adverse events, or any safety information invalidating
the earlier positive benefit-risk-assessment (see Section [IP_ADDRESS])
5. More than 50% of the subjects show drug-related and clinically relevant adverse events of 
moderate or severe intensity
The investigator / trial site will be reimbursed for reasonable expenses incurred in case of 
trial termination (except if item 3 applies).
3.3.5 Replacement of subjects
In case more than 10 subjects do not complete the trial (including subjects non- evaluable for 
PK), additional subjects may be recruited and treated with the respective treatment if considered necessary to reach the objective of the trial. Subjects who withdraw or arewithdrawn from treatment or assessments because of a drug-related adverse event will not be replaced and no additional subject will be recruited in such a case. The Clinical Trial Leadertogether with the Trial Pharmacokineticist and the Trial Statistician are to decide, if and how many subjects will be replaced, i.e. recruited in addition. The total number of replacements may not exceed 1/[ADDRESS_884905] he or she replaces.

individuals involved in the primary analysis and reporting.
Access to the randomization code will be controlled and documented. All persons directly 
involved in the conduct of the trial will have no access to the treatment allocation prior to final database lock.
PK samples will be labelled in such a way that treatment allocation cannot be derived by [CONTACT_656818].
Emergency envelopes will not be provided, since all subjects will receive the same dose of 
the same drug.
4.1.6 Packaging, labelling, and re-supply
The investigational medicinal products will be provided by [CONTACT_23292] a designated CRO. They 
will be packaged and labelled in accordance with the principles of Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP).

is to be maintained throughout the course of the trial. Acceptable methods of birth control include, for example: combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception that prevents ovulation (oral, intravaginal or transdermal); progestogen-only hormonal contraception that inhibits ovulation (only injectables or implants); intrauterine devices (IUDs) or intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS); surgical sterilization;vasectomized partner or be Sexually abstinent.
Women of childbearing potential are defined as:
!Having experienced menarche and
!Not postmenopausal (12 months with no menses without an alternative medical 
cause) and 
!Not permanently sterilized (e.g., tubal occlusion, hysterectomy, bilateral 
oophorectomy or bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656]).
Women must not breast-feed for at least six months after the adalimumab treatment.
4.3 TREATMENT COMPLIANCE
Compliance will be assured by [CONTACT_656822] a designee. The measured plasma concentrations of trial medication will provide additional confirmation of compliance.
Subjects who are non-compliant (for instance, who do not appear for scheduled visits or 
violate trial restrictions) may be removed from the trial and the CRF will be completed accordingly (for further procedures, please see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ).

5.2.6 Assessment of adverse events
[IP_ADDRESS] Definitions of adverse events
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Adverse eventAn adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation subject administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.
An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether considered related or not.
The following should also be recorded as an AE in the CRF and BI SAE form (if applicable):
!Worsening of the underlying disease or of other pre-existing conditions 
!Changes in vital signs, ECG, physical examination, and laboratory test results, if they 
are judged clinically relevant by [CONTACT_656826]-exist prior to trial inclusion, they will be considered as baseline conditions and should be collected in the eCRF only.

A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any AE which fulfils at least one of the 
following criteria:
!Results in death 
!Is life-threatening, which refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of death at 
the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if more severe 
!Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956], or prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956]
!Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity 
!Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect
!Is deemed serious for any other reason if it is an important medical event when based 
upon appropriate medical judgment which may jeopardise the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definitions. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23236]
[IP_ADDRESS].3 AEs considered ‘Always Serious’In accordance with the European Medicines Agency initiative on Important Medical Events, 
Boehringer Ingelheim has set up a list of AEs, which, by [CONTACT_15623], can always be considered to be ‘serious’ even though they may not have met the criteria of an SAE as defined above.
The latest list of ‘Always Serious AEs’ can be found in the eDC system, an electronic data 
capture system which allows the entry of trial data at the trial site. A copy of the latest list of ‘Always Serious AEs’ will be provided upon request. These events should always be reported as SAEs as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] .
Cancers of new histology must be classified as a serious event regardless of the time since 
discontinuation of the trial medication and must be reported as described in [IP_ADDRESS], subsections ‘AE Collection’ and ‘ AE reporting to sponsor and timelines’ .
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_884931] (AESI) relates to any specific AE that has been 
identified at the project level as being of particular concern for prospective safety monitoring and safety assessment within this trial, e.g. the potential for AEs based on knowledge from other compounds in the same class. AESIs need to be reported to the sponsor’s Pharmacovigilance Department within the same timeframe that applies to SAEs, please see Section [IP_ADDRESS].2 .
The following are considered as AESIs:
1. Potential severe DILI
A potential severe Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI) that requires follow-up is 
defined by [CONTACT_35961]:

aminotransferase) ≥3-fold ULN combined with an elevation of total bilirubin 
≥2-fold ULN measured in the same blood sample, or in samples drawn within 
30 days of each other, or
o Aminotransferase (ALT, and/or AST) elevations ≥10-fold ULN
These lab findings constitute a hepatic injury alert and the subjects showing these lab 
abnormalities need to be followed up according to the ‘DILI checklist’ provided viathe eDC. In case of clinical symptoms of hepatic injury (icterus, unexplained encephalopathy, unexplained coagulopathy, right upper quadrant abdominal pain, etc.) without lab results (ALT, AST, total bilirubin) available, the Investigator should make sure that these parameters are analysed, if necessary in an unscheduled blood test. Should the results meet the criteria of hepatic injury alert, the procedures described in the DILI checklist should be followed.
2. Anaphylactic reactions
3. Serious infection (defined as infections requiring IV antibiotics or meeting the 
regulatory definition of a SAE)
4. Hypersensitivity reactions
[IP_ADDRESS].5 Intensity (severity) of AEsThe intensity (severity) of the AE should be judged based on the following:
Mild: Awareness of sign(s) or symptom(s) that is/are easily tolerated
Moderate: Sufficient discomfort to cause interference with usual activitySevere: Incapacitating or causing inability to work or to perform usual activities
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_884934] that there is a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship 
could be:
!The event is consistent with the known pharmacology of the drug 
!The event is known to be caused by [CONTACT_23320]
!A plausible time to onset of the event relative to the time of drug exposure
!Evidence that the event is reproducible when the drug is re-introduced
!No medically sound alternative aetiologies that could explain the event (e.g. pre-
existing or concomitant diseases, or co-medications)
!The event is typi[INVESTIGATOR_23239]-related and infrequent in the general population not 
exposed to drugs (e.g. Stevens-Johnson syndrome)
!An indication of dose-response (i.e. greater effect size if the dose is increased, smaller 
effect size if dose is reduced)

unchanged
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse event collection and reporting5.[IP_ADDRESS] AE collectionUpon enrolment into a trial, the subject’s baseline condition is assessed (for instance, by 
[CONTACT_656827]/concomitant diagnoses), and relevant changes from baseline are noted subsequently. 
Subjects will be required to report spontaneously any AEs. In addition, each subject will be 
regularly assessed by [CONTACT_656828]. As a minimum, subjects will be questioned for AEs (and concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) at the time points indicated in the Flow Chart . Assessment will be 
made using non-specific questions such as ‘How do you feel?’. Specific questions will be 
asked wherever necessary in order to more precisely describe an AE.
A carefully written record of all AEs shall be kept by [CONTACT_656829]. 
Records of AEs shall include data on the time of onset, end time, intensity of the event, and any treatment or action required for the event and its outcome.
The following must be collected and documented on the appropriate CRF(s) by [CONTACT_1275]:
!From signing the informed consent onwards until an individual subject’s end of trial
(the End of Study (EoS) visit): 
oAll AEs (serious and non-serious) and all AESIs 
oThe only exception to this rule are AEs (serious and non-serious) and AESIs 
in Phase I trials in healthy volunteers, when subjects discontinue from the trial due to screening failures prior to administration of any trial medication. In these cases, the subjects’ data must be collected at trial site but will not be entered in the CRF and will not be reported in the CTR.

should only report any occurrence of cancer and trial treatment related SAEsand trial treatment related AESIs of which the investigator may become aware of by [CONTACT_23321], e.g. phone call. Those AEs should be reported on the BI SAE form (see Section [IP_ADDRESS].2 ), but not on the CRF.
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_884939] report SAEs, AESIs, and non-serious AEs which are relevant for the 
reported SAE or AESI, on the BI SAE form to the sponsor’s unique entry point within [ADDRESS_884940] the requirement to complete and send the BI SAE form.
With receipt of any further information to these events, a follow-up SAE form has to be 
provided. For follow-up information, the same rules and timeline apply as for initial information. All (S)AEs, including those persisting after the individual subject’s end of trial, must be followed up until they have resolved, have been sufficiently characterized (e.g. as ‘chronic’ or ‘stable’), or no further information can be obtained.
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_884941] report any drug exposure during pregnancy in a trial participant immediately (within 24 hours) by [CONTACT_15627] A of the Pregnancy Monitoring Form to the sponsor’s unique entry point.
The outcome of the pregnancy associated with the drug exposure during pregnancy must be 
followed up and reported to the sponsor’s unique entry point on the Pregnancy Monitoring Form for Clinical Studies (Part B). The ISF will contain the Pregnancy Monitoring Form for Clinical Studies (Part A and Part B).
As pregnancy itself is not to be reported as an AE, in the absence of an accompanying SAE 
and/or AESI, only the Pregnancy Monitoring Form for Clinical Studies and not the SAE form is to be completed. If there is an SAE and/or AESI associated with the pregnancy, an SAE form must be completed in addition.
5.3 DRUG CONCENTRATION MEASUREMENTS AND 
PHARMACOKINETICS

[IP_ADDRESS] Blood sampling for pharmacokinetic analysis
Samples of whole blood (approximately 3 mL) will be taken (in tubes containing dipotassium 
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid [K2EDTA] anticoagulant) at the time points shown in the Flow chart for the determination of concentrations of BI 695501.
Full instructions for collection, labelling, storage and shipment of samples are provided in the 
Laboratory Manual. After completion of the trial, selected PK samples may be retained and used for further methodological investigations, e.g., stability testing. The PK samples will be discarded after completion of the additional investigations, but not later than 5 years after the final Clinical Trial Report (CTR) has been signed.
Wherever possible, blood samples for other analyses will be taken at the same time as blood 
is drawn for PK analyses to limit repeated venipuncture.
In the event of early withdrawal from the trial, every effort should be made to take a PK 
sample as part of the early withdrawal procedures, if possible, with date and time of sample recorded.

The relative bioavailability of 40 mg BI 695501 100 mg/mL formulation (T) versus 40 mg BI 
695501 50 mg/mL formulation (R) will be estimated by [CONTACT_656812] (T/R) for each primary endpoint, and their corresponding 2-sided 90% confidence intervals (CIs) will be provided. This method corresponds to the two one-sided t-test procedure, each at the 5% significance level. Since the main focus is on estimation and not testing, a formal hypothesis test and associated acceptance range is not specified and no significance level adjustment for multiple testing will be applied.
7.2 PLANNED ANALYSES
7.2.1 Analysis sets
Statistical analyses will be based on the following analysis sets:
!Treated set (TS): The treated set includes all subjects who were randomized and 
treated with at least one dose of study drug. The TS will be used for safety analyses.
!Pharmacokinetic parameter analysis set (PKS): This set includes all subjects in the 
treated set (TS) who provide at least one PK endpoint that was defined as primary and was without important protocol deviations or violations thought to significantly affect the PK of BI 695501 (as specified in [IP_ADDRESS]). Descriptive and model based analyses of PK parameters will be based on the PKS.
Descriptions of additional analysis sets may be provided in the TSAP.Adherence to the protocol will be assessed by [CONTACT_476974]. Important protocol deviation 
(iPD) categories will be suggested in the iPD specification file. IPDs will be identified no later than in the Report Planning Meeting, and the iPD categories will be updated as needed.

!Time deviations
!Use of restricted medications
!Dosing errors 
Whether a protocol violation is important will be decided no later than in the Report Planning Meeting. It will also be decided in the Report Planning Meeting which subjects are to be excluded from the PKS. Subjects who are not included in the PKS (refer to Section 7.2.1 ) 
will be reported with their individual plasma concentrations and individual PK parameters;

In case a pre-dose concentration value is greater than 5% of Cmax, the subject’s PK data will 
not be included in any statistical evaluations, in accordance with international guidance. The individual PK parameters of such a subject will be calculated and listed separately. If a predose concentration is above the limit of quantification, but less than or equal to 5% of the subject’s Cmax value, the subject’s data without any adjustments will be included in all PK  measurements and calculations.
Details of the analysis and presentation of PK data will be provided in the Trial Statistical 
Analysis Plan (TSAP).
Only concentration values within the validated concentration range and actual sampling times 
will be used for the calculation of pharmacokinetic parameters. Concentrations used in the pharmacokinetic calculations will be in the same format provided in the bioanalytical report, (that is, to the same number of decimal places provided in the bioanalytical report). 
7.2.2 Primary endpoint analyses
Primary analyses
The primary analysis is based on  the PKS (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). The statistical model used 
for the analysis of the primary endpoints will be an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model 
on the logarithmic scale. That is, the PK endpoints will be log-transformed (natural logarithm) prior to fitting the ANCOVA model. This model will include effects accounting for the following sources of variation: ‘treatment’, ‘location of trial medication injection’ and ‘baseline body weight’. The model is described by [CONTACT_12801]:
y
kjm = ∃+ %k+ φj+ &·weight km+ ekjm, where
ykjm= logarithm of response on subject m receiving treatment k at location j,
∃= the overall mean,
%k= the kthtreatment effect, k = 1, 2,
φj= the jtheffect of location (thigh, abdomen), j= 1, 2,
&= the slope parameter for the baseline body weight covariable,
weight km= baseline body weight of subject m receiving treatment k
ekjm= the random error associated with the mthsubject who received
in location j treatment k
where    ~ (0,   )are independent random variables.
Point estimates for the ratios of the geometric means (T/R) for the primary endpoints (see 
Section 2.1) and their two-sided 90% confidence intervals (CIs) will be provided.
For each endpoint, the difference between the expected means for log(T)-log(R) will be 
estimated by [CONTACT_656832] (Least Squares Means).

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_884956]-13 (7 0) / Saved on: 22 Jun 2021Additionally their two-sided 90% confidence intervals will be calculated based on the residual error from the ANCOVA and quantiles from the t-distribution. These quantities will then be back-transformed to the original scale to provide the point estimate and 90% CIs for each endpoint.
In addition to the model based approach all parameters will be calculated and analysed 
descriptively.
7.2.3 Secondary endpoint analyses
Not applicable as no secondary endpoints specified.
7.2.5 Safety analyses 
Safety will be analysed based on the assessments described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] . All treated 
subjects (TS, refer to Section 7.2) will be included in the safety analysis. Safety analyses will 
be descriptive in nature and based on BI standards. No hypothesis testing is planned.
For all analyses, the treatment actually administered (= treatment at onset) to the subject will 
be used (any deviations from the randomised treatment will be discussed at the Report Planning Meeting).
Treatments will be compared in a descriptive way. Tabulations of frequencies/proportions 
will be used to evaluate categorical (qualitative) data, and tabulations of descriptive statistics will be used to analyse continuous (quantitative) data.
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA). All events with an onset after the first dose of trial medication up to a period of [ADDRESS_884957] dose of the trial medication (i.e., end of the REP) will be assigned to the treatment phase for evaluation, and will be referred to as treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs). Frequency, intensity and causal relationship of AEs will be tabulated by [CONTACT_3148], primary system organ class and preferred term. SAEs and other significant AEs (according to ICH E3), and protocol-specified AESIs (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ), will be listed 
separately.

7.3.2 Pharmacokinetics
Handling of missing PK data will be performed according to the relevant procedures of the 
Sponsor. 
Drug concentration data identified with NOS (no sample available), NOR (no valid result), 
NOA (not analysed)will not be considered for the non-compartmental analysis and the creation of graphs, except for concentration values in the lag phase identified as BLQ which will be set to zero. The lag phase is defined as the period between time zero and the first time point with a concentration above the quantification limit.
Descriptive statistics of parameters are calculated only when a parameter value is available 
for at least 2/3 of the treated individuals. If the actual sampling time is not recorded or is missing for a certain time point, the planned time will generally be used for this time point instead. PK parameters that cannot be determined will be identified as “not calculated”.

Subjects will be randomized to one of the two treatments in a 1:[ADDRESS_884962] replacement (referto Section 3.3.5 ).
7.5 DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE
It is planned to enter a total of N=200 subjects in the trial including up to 10 subjects, that 
may be considered as non-PK evaluable (refer to Section 7.2), because this sample size is 
considered sufficient to assess the primary objective of this exploratory trial. With this 
sample size, the following precision in estimating the ratio of geometric means (T/R) can be expected with 95% probability. Precision is defined as the ratio of upper 90% confidence interval limit (CL) to the relative BA estimate. Note that the precision is independent of the actual ratio of geometric means.
In previous trials (1297.6 and 1297.13) the observed total geometric coefficient of variation 
(gCV) for the primary endpoints AUC and Cmax were in the range of 25% - 54%. The observed gCVs tended to be higher in trial 1297.6, in which the study drug was injected in lower abdomen only. 
For various assumptions of the gCV, Table 7.5: 1 provides an overview of the achievable 
precision for estimating the ratio of geometric means (T/R). For illustrative purposes, the 
expected 90% confidence intervals are displayed for different values of the ratio T/R of geometric means.

The trial will be carried out in compliance with the protocol, the ethical principles laid down 
in the Declaration of Helsinki, in accordance with the ICH Harmonized Guideline for Good Clinical Practice (GCP), relevant BI Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), and other relevant regulations. Investigators and site staff must adhere to these principles. Deviation from the protocol, the principles of ICH GCP or applicable regulations will be treated as ‘protocol deviation’.
Standard medical care (prophylactic, diagnostic, and therapeutic procedures) remains the 
responsibility of the subject’s treating physician.
The investigator will inform the sponsor immediately of any urgent safety measures taken to 
protect the trial subjects against any immediate hazard, as well as of any serious breaches of the protocol or of ICH GCP.
The Boehringer Ingelheim transparency and publication policy can be found on the following 
web page: trials.boehringer-ingelheim.com. The rights of the investigator and of the sponsor with regard to publication of the results of this trial are described in the investigator contract.As a general rule, no trial results should be published prior to finalisation of the CTR.

A quality assurance audit/inspection of this trial may be conducted by [CONTACT_456], sponsor’s 
designees, or by [CONTACT_1744] / IEC or by [CONTACT_12721]. The quality assurance auditor will have access to all medical records, the investigator’s trial-related files and correspondence, and the informed consent documentation of this clinical trial.
8.[ADDRESS_884968] that include all observations and other data pertinent to the investigation. Source data as well as reported data should follow the ‘ALCOA principles’ and be attributable, legible, contemporaneous, 
original, and accurate. Changes to the data should be traceable (audit trail).
Data reported on the CRF must be consistent with the source data or the discrepancies must be explained.
The current medical history of the subject may not be sufficient to confirm eligibility for the 
trial and the investigator may need to request previous medical histories and evidence of any diagnostic tests. In this case, the investigator must make at least one documented attempt to retrieve previous medical records. If this fails, a verbal history from the subject, documented in their medical records, would be acceptable.
Before providing any copy of subjects’ source documents to the sponsor, the investigator 
must ensure that all subject identifiers (e.g., subject’s name, initials, address, phone number, and social security number) have properly been removed or redacted to ensure subject confidentiality.
If the subject is not compliant with the protocol, any corrective action (e.g. re-training) must 
be documented in the subject file.
For the CRF, data must be derived from source documents, for example:

To prevent unblinding, a designated person will receive the trial medication and maintain 
records of the product’s delivery to the trial site. In addition, a qualified unblinded designee will administer the trial medication, maintain the inventory at the site, as well as will be responsible for preparation of used trial medication for return to the sponsor or destruction in a blinded fashion and in accordance with local requirements.
Records of the product’s delivery to the trial site will include dates, quantities, batch/serial 
numbers, expi[INVESTIGATOR_4061] (‘use by’) dates and the unique code numbers assigned to the investigational products and trial patients. The designated unblinded person will maintain records that document doses administration to patients and reconcile all investigational product received at site. These records should be kept separate from the patients file and not be accessible for the blinded personnel. At the time of return to the sponsor or local destruction, the designated unblinded person must verify that no supplies remained at the trial site.

Patient blinding procedure
Trial medication will be administered by [CONTACT_656837] 1. 
To ensure patient’s blinding during the administration process, the following procedures are to be applied:
• Syringes unpacked and prepared for injection are to be covered by a surgical drape at 
the time of patient preparation for dosing. The same procedure is to be applied to used syringes after injection.
• During the dose administration, patients are to be separated from the unblinded 
designee who will administer the trial medication, by [CONTACT_656838], screen or pi[INVESTIGATOR_6356].
• If a patient’s dosing is required in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547], the screen or curtain (the way it is 
used during surgery) or towel are to be put at chest level.
Site staff blinding procedure
Responsibilities for blinded and unblinded study site staff are defined below. At the site, a 
form with the name(s) of the staff members, blinded and unblinded, with their respective responsibilities will be filled in.
(NOTE: all personnel noted below will have signed the Site Personnel Signature [CONTACT_94618], clearly

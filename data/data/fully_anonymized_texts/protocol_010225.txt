Protocol Synopsis 
Title:  A Phase 1b Study of Talimogene Laherparepvec in Combination With Atezolizumab in 
Subjects With Triple Negative Breast Cancer and Colorectal Cancer With Liver Metastases  
Study Phase:   Phase 1b 
Indication:   Triple negative breast cancer and colorectal cancer with liver metastases  
Primary Objective:    
To evaluate the safety, as assessed by [CONTACT_304361] (DLTs), of intrahepatic 
injection of talimogene laherparepvec into liver metastases in combination with intravenously 
administered atezolizumab separately in subjects with triple negative breast cancer and colorectal 
cancer  
Secondary Objective s:   
To evaluate the efficacy of talimogene laherparepvec in combination with atezolizumab 
separately in subjects with triple negative breast cancer and colorectal cancer with liver 
metastases as assessed by: 
 Objective response rate (ORR), best overall response (BOR), duration of response (DOR), 
lesion level responses in injected and uninjected tumor lesions (overall, hepatic, nonhepatic) 
disease control rate (DCR), durable response rate (DRR), progression-free survival (PFS), 
overall survival (OS) by [CONTACT_9084] ( triple negative breast cancer and colorectal cancer )  
Safety Objective: 
 To evaluate the safety and tolerability of intrahepatic injection of talimogene laherparepvec 
into liver metastases in combination with intravenously administered atezolizumab separately  
in subjects with triple negative breast cancer and colorectal cancer  
Hypotheses:  
It is hypothesized that intrahepatic injection of talimogene laherparepvec in combination with 
intravenously administered atezolizumab in subjects with triple negative breast cancer and 
colorectal cancer with liver metastases will be safe and well tolerated with a DLT rate ≤ 10%.  
Primary Endpoint:    
 Subject incidence of DLTs by [CONTACT_9084] (triple negative breast cancer and colorectal cancer) 
Secondary Endpoints:   
 ORR, BOR, DOR, lesion level responses (≥ 30% and 100% decrease) in injected and 
uninjected tumor lesions (overall, hepatic, nonhepatic), DRR, DCR, PFS, and OS by [CONTACT_9084] 
(triple negative breast cancer and colorectal cancer) 
Safety Endpoint: 
 Subject incidence of adverse events and clinically relevant laboratory abnormalities by 
[CONTACT_44847] (triple negative breast cancer and colorectal cancer) 
Study Design:   This is a phase 1b, multicenter, open-label study to evaluate the safety of 
intrahepatic injection of talimogene laherparepvec in combination with intravenously administered 
atezolizumab in subjects with triple negative breast cancer and colorectal cancer with liver 
metastases.  Talimogene laherparepvec will be injected intrahepatically in combination with 
intravenous atezolizumab to approximately [ADDRESS_372240] cancer with liver metastases 
(n =18 DLT-evaluable subjects ).  Cohort 2 will comprise subjects with colorectal cancer with 
unresectable liver metastases (n =18 DLT-evaluable subjects ).  The DLT evaluation period for a 
given subject will consist of the period between the initial 106 PFU/mL dose of talimogene 
laherparepvec and atezolizumab and 3 weeks following the initial 108 PFU/mL dose of talimogene 
laherparepvec and atezolizumab or the start of cycle 3, whichever occurs first .  DLTs will be

Date:  [ADDRESS_372241] 18 DLT-evaluable subjects in each cohort separately.  A Dose Level 
Review Team (DLRT) will review the safety data to evaluate possible drug effects and DLT.  To 
be evaluable for a DLT, subjects must have had the opportunity to be on treatment for at least 
[ADDRESS_372242] experiences a DLT (during the 
DLT evaluation period), has complete response ( CR), has need for an alternative anticancer 
therapy, or experiences an adverse event necessitating drug discontinuation.  In addition, 
treatment will be discontinued for talimogene laherparepvec if the subject has no injectable 
lesions, upon confirmed progressive disease ( PD) per modified immune related response criteria 
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (irRC-RECIST) or rapid clinical deterioration.  
Atezolizumab will be discontinued upon symptomatic disease progressi on.  All subjects will 
complete a safety follow-up visit approximately 30 (+ 7) days after the last dose of study 
treatment.  After the safety follow-up visit, all subjects will enter the long-term follow-up.  Subjects 
will be followed for survival, subsequent anticancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_304314]-related adverse 
events every 12 weeks (± 28 days) for approximately [ADDRESS_372243] is enrolled.  
Sample Size:   Approximately 36 subjects will be enrolled (18 DLT-evaluable  subjects in each 
cohort). 
Summary of Subject Eligibility Criteria:   To be eligible for the study subjects must be age 
≥ [ADDRESS_372244] disease progression during or after ≥ [ADDRESS_372245] Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 
(ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1, adequate organ function and life expectancy ≥ [ADDRESS_372246] received liver 
metastatic-directed therapy (eg, radiation, ablation, embolization), hepatic surgery, 
antibody-based therapy, or immunotherapy < 4 weeks prior to enrollment .  Subjects with a history 
of malignancy (other than the current malignanc y) within the past 5 years will be excluded with 
some exceptions.  Subjects with active or untreated central nervous system (CNS) metastases, 
presence of leptomeningeal disease or spi[INVESTIGATOR_304315].  Subjects with 
symptomatic autoimmune disease or who are immunosuppressed will be excluded.  Subjects with 
active herpetic skin lesions or prior complications of herpetic infection (eg, herpetic keratitis or 
encephalitis), or who require intermittent and chronic systemic treatment with an antiherpetic drug 
(other than intermittent topi[INVESTIGATOR_44785]), will not be eligible for the study .  Subjects receiving 
concomitant treatment with warfarin are not eligible for the study. 
For a full list of eligibility criteria, please refer to Section 4.[ADDRESS_372247] Dosage and Administration:   Talimogene laherparepvec will 
be manufactured and packaged by [CONTACT_21931].  Talimogene laherparepvec is supplied as a 
sterile frozen liquid in a single-use vial .  Each vial contains a minimum of 1.0 mL talimogene 
laherparepvec at either 106 plaque-forming unit (PFU)/mL or 108 PFU/ mL concentrations.  The 
first cycle of talimogene laherparepvec will be 21 (+ 3) days.  Subsequent cycles of talimogene 
laherparepvec will be [ADDRESS_372248] dose of talimogene laherparepvec will 
be up to 4.0 mL of 106 PFU/mL.  During the second cycle, talimogene laherparepvec will be

administered up to 4.0 mL of 108 PFU/mL at week 4 of the study ( ± 3 days).  During subsequent 
cycles, talimogene laherparepvec will be administered up to 4.0 mL of 108 PFU/mL every 21 days 
(± 3 days) thereafter.  The maximum volume of talimogene laherparepvec to be administered at 
any dose is 4.0 mL for any individual tumor lesion or for all tumor lesions combined.  Talimogene 
laherparepvec will be administered by [CONTACT_44838] (either ultrasound or computerized 
tomography [ CT]) into injectable liver lesions.  After 6 cycles of intrahepatic talimogene 
laherparepvec are administered, there is an investigator option to continue talimogene 
laherparepvec injections for up to an additional 6 cycles (for a maximum of 12 total cycles of 
talimogene laherparepvec).   During this additional dosing period (cycles 7 to 12), talimogene 
laherparepvec may be administered by [CONTACT_304362], 
subcutaneous, and nodal tumor lesions, or both.  For cycles [ADDRESS_372249] Dosage and Administration:   Atezolizumab will be 
manufactured by [CONTACT_8229].  Atezolizumab is supplied as a single-use, 20-cc Pharmacopeia 
(USP)/European Pharmacopoeia (Ph. Eur.) type 1 glass vial as a colorless- to-slightly-yellow, 
sterile, preservative-free clear liquid solution intended for intravenous administration.  The vial is 
designed to deliver 20 mL (1200 mg) of atezolizumab solution but may contain more than the 
stated volume to enable delivery of the entire [ADDRESS_372250] cycle of atezolizumab will 
be 21 (+ 3) days.  Subsequent cycles of atezolizumab will be 21 (± 3) days.  Atezolizumab will be 
administered intravenously at a dose of 1200 mg.  Administration of atezolizumab will be 
performed in a setting with emergency medical facilities and staff who are trained to monitor for 
and respond to medical emergencies.  The initial dose of atezolizumab (day 1, cycle 1) will be 
delivered over 60 (± 15) minutes.  If the first infusion is tolerated without infusion-associated 
adverse events, the second infusion may be delivered over 30 ( ± 10) minutes.  If the 30-minute 
infusion is well tolerated, all subsequent infusions may be delivered over 30 (± 10) minutes.  The 
subject’s vital signs should be determined up to 60 minutes before each atezolizumab infusion.  
Vital signs should also be obtained during or after the atezolizumab infusion if clinically indicated.   
Refer to Section 6.2.2 . 
Procedures:   Written informed consent must be obtained from all subjects or legally acceptable 
representatives before any study specific screening procedures are performed.  The following 
procedures will occur per the Schedule of Assessments:  medical history, concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], 
physical examination and vital signs, body weight, ECOG performance status, 12-lead 
electrocardiogram (ECG) , recording of concomitant medications, survival assessment, review of 
adverse events, disease related events (serious or non-serious) and serious adverse events as 
well as reporting of potential or known unintended exposure to talimogene laherparepvec by a 
household member, caregiver, or healthcare provider .  Blood will be collected for local laboratory 
testing including:  urinalysis, chemistry, hematology, coagulation, thyroid function, hepatitis B 
surface antigen, hepatitis B core antibo dy, hepatitis C virus antibody and human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) .  Tumor markers in the blood will be collected in subjects with triple 
negative breast cancer (cancer antigen 27.29 [CA 27.29], cancer antigen 15-3 [CA 15- 3]) and 
subjects with colorectal cancer (carcinoembryonic antigen [CEA] and CA- 19-9).  In females of 
childbearing potential serum pregnancy tests will be performed locally.  Central laboratory testing 
will include blood for herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) serostatus, and blood for biomarker 
analysis.  Liver tumor biopsies and clinical and radiological tumor assessments will also be 
performed. 
For a full list of study procedures, including the timing of each procedure, please refer to 
Section 7 and the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 7-1 ).   
Statistical Considerations:    
The null hypothesis (H0) is that the combination of talimogene laherparepvec and atezolizumab 
has a DLT rate ≤ 10%.  An unacceptable alternative hypothesis (Ha) is a true DLT rate ≥ 33%.  
The sample size goal is to have ≥ 80% power for a 1-sided ≤ 10% significance level test to reject 
H0 when Ha is true ( Goldman, 1987 ).  Eighteen DLT-evaluable subjects in each cohort will be 
required to test H0.   Assuming the incidence of DLTs is evaluated as specified by [CONTACT_50489] 3-1  in 
Section 3.1, this design achieves a 7.7% 1-sided significance level and 81.6% power.  The data

Section [IP_ADDRESS] .  The safety analysis set will be used for all safety analyses.  The safety analyses 
include incidence of treatment-emergent and treatment-related adverse events (all adverse 
events, ≥ grade [ADDRESS_372252]).  The efficacy analysis will be conducted using the safety 
analysis set unless otherwise specified.  ORR, BOR, DRR, and DCR will be summarized with the 
associated 95% confidence interval (CIs).  DOR, PFS, and OS will be summarized and estimated 
using the Kaplan-Meier method.  Interim safety analyses will be performed for evaluation of DLTs 
for DLRT meetings.  All available safety data will be considered at interim safety analysis.  For a 
full description of statistical analysis methods, please refer to Section 10.

Human cancer cells are characterized by a multitude of genetic aberrations 
(Alexandrov et al, 2013; Lawrence et al, 2013 ), many of which may be associated with 
immunogenicity by [CONTACT_304364][INVESTIGATOR_304318]-cell recognition 
(Segal et al, 2008).  The immune response, largely mediated by [CONTACT_20150]-reactive T cells, 
can be rapid, durable, and adaptable.  A recent study demonstrated that novel epi[INVESTIGATOR_304319]-reactive T cells and may 
mediate response to T cell checkpoint inhibitors ( van Rooij et al, 2013).  Moreover, the 
durable responses observed in a subset of patients lo ng after completion of ther apy 
suggest the generation of T cell memory, which has been associated with improved 
overall survival in cancer patients ( Pages et al, 2005 ; Kilinc et al, 2009).  
The immune system recognizes and is poised to eliminate cancer but is held in check by 
[CONTACT_304365].  These immune checkpoint pathways, which 
normally maintain self-tolerance and limit collateral tissue damage during anti-microbial 
immune responses, can be co-opted by [CONTACT_304366] 
(Topalian et al, 2012 ).  Monoclonal antibodies have been developed that will block 
specific immune checkpoint proteins and unleash anti-tumor activity.  Available approved 
immune checkpoint inhibitors include ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], nivolumab, pembrolizum ab, and 
atezolizumab .  Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_304320] T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) 
thereby [CONTACT_304367] T cell activation, restoring T cell proliferation, and amplifying 
T cell-mediated immunity.  Nivolumab and pembrolizumab are antibodies that will block 
programmed cell death 1 ( PD-1) on the surface of the T  cells preventing them from 
interacting with PD-L1.  Atezolizumab blocks PD-L1.  Immune-based therapi[INVESTIGATOR_304321] a proportion of patients with cancer, and combination approaches are being 
explored to improve therapeutic efficacy.    
PD-1 is an inhibitory receptor expressed on T cells following T cell activation, which is 
sustained in states of chronic stimulation such as in chronic infection or cancer 
(Blank et al, 2005; Keir et al, 2008).  Ligation of PD-L1 with PD-1 inhibits T cell 
proliferation, cytokine production, and cytolytic activity, leading to the functional 
inactivation of T cell responses.  Aberrant expression of PD- L1 on tumor cells has been 
reported to impede anti-tumor immunity, resulting in immune evasion 
(Blank and Mackensen, 2007 ).  Therefore, interruption of the PD-L1/PD-[ADDRESS_372283] 
represents an attractive strategy to reinvigorate tumor-specific T cell immunity. 
PD-L1 expression is prevalent in many human tumors, and elevated PD-L1 expression 
is associated with a poor prognosis in patients with non–small cell lung cancer

(Mu et al, 2011) and other solid tumors ( Hino et al, 2010 ; Hamanishi et al, 2007;  
Thompson et al, 2006 ).   
The field of cancer immunotherapy is expanding beyond checkpoint inhibition to include 
such categories as T cell growth factors/stimulators, cancer vaccines, inhibitors of 
cancer cell and immune cell suppression, dendritic cell growth factors and activators.  
Oncolytic immunotherapy is an emerging treatment modality which uses replication 
competent oncolytic viruses that will selectively infect and damage cancerous tissues 
without causing harm to normal tissues.  Each oncolytic virus has a specific cellular 
tropi[INVESTIGATOR_304322] ( Russell et al, 2014).  Ongoing studies are using a variety of 
engineered viruses , including but not limited to herpes simplex virus (HSV), vaccinia, 
and reovirus.

Annually in the [LOCATION_002], approximately 232,[ADDRESS_372285] cancer according to the Surveillance, Epi[INVESTIGATOR_623], and 
End Results ( SEER) Program.  Triple negative tumors account for about 15% of all 
invasive breast cancers ( Foulkes et al , 2010 ).  Among metastatic triple negative cases, 
the first distant site is lung (40%), brain (30%), liver (20%), and bone (10%) 
(Foulkes et al, 2010).  With subsequent metastases, the liver will be diagnosed as a 
metastatic site in up to 50% of women with metastatic triple negative breast cancer 
(Lin et al, 2008 ).  The estimated 5-year survival rate for metastatic triple negative breast 
cancer is approximately 22% according to the SEER database.  Incidence of triple 
negative breast cancer is increased in patients with germline breast cancer susceptibility 
gene 1 ( BRCA1 ) mutations and African ancestry.  Triple negative breast cancers are 
generally, aggressive tumors with a high rate of distant metastases and worse 
disease-specific survival than other breast cancer subtypes (Dent et al, 2007 ; 
Haffty et al, 2006 ).  Tumors with the triple negative phenotype have specific features that 
are potential therapeutic targets (e g, they show an impaired deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA) 
repair mechanism and increased expression of basal-associated and proliferation 
associated markers).  Currently, the main treatment modality used is chemotherapy but

There is significant heterogeneity within triple negative breast cancer.  A study analyzing 
gene expression profiling identified 6 subtypes, one of which was an immunomodulatory 
subtype enriched for genes involved in immune cell processes including immune cell 
signaling, cytokine signaling, antigen processing and presentation, and signaling through 
core immune signal transduction pathways ( Lehman n et al , 2011 ).  In addition, the 
clinical importance of tumor immune infiltrates has been an emerging area of research in 
triple negative breast cancer, where an increased number of immune infiltrates seems to 
predict both response to chemotherapy and improved survival in the neoadjuvant setting 
and is a prognostic factor in the adjuvant setting ( Adams et al, 2014; Dieci et al, 2014, 
Ono et al, 2012).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Immunotherapy in Triple Negative Breast Cancer 
Clinical studies in breast cancer to date have focused on countering immune 
suppression by [CONTACT_304368]-3 (LAG-3), CTLA-4 or PD- L1 
pathways.  PD-L1 is expressed in approximately 20% of patients with triple negative 
breast cancer and treatment with anti PD-1 and anti PD-L1 agents (eg, pembrolizumab, 
atezolizumab, nivolumab) is currently under investigation in several ongoing trials. 
Data indicate that PD-1/PD-L1 pathway b lockade has clinical activity in patients with 
metastatic triple negative breast cancer.  Atezolizumab (anti-PD-L1)  is being evaluated 
in an ongoing phase 1a study exploring its safety and efficacy, as well as biomarkers of 
response in a variety of cancers .  One expansion cohort has enrolled patients with both 
PD-L1 positive and PD-L1 negative triple negative breast carcinoma 
(Emens et al, 2015).  Tumors were considered to be PD-L1 positi
ve if ≥ 5% of infiltrating 
immune cells stained for PD-L1 expression by [CONTACT_9064].  Among 
prescreened patients, 23% were PD- L1 positive at first report.  Enrolled patients were 
heavily treated, with 89% having received more than 4 lines of systemic therapy.  
Atezolizumab was given at 15 or 20 mg/kg of a 1,200 mg flat intravenous dose every 
3 weeks.  Atezolizumab was well tolerated in 54 patients with PD-L1 positive and 
PD-L1 negative disease who were evaluable for safety.  Low-grade adverse events, 
including fatigue, nausea, fever, anorexia, 
and asthenia, were obs erved in 63% of 
patients, while 11% of patients experienced grade [ADDRESS_372287]:  Talimogene Laherparepvec 
Protocol Number:  20140299  
Date:  [ADDRESS_372288] cancer evaluable for efficacy was 19%, 
including 2 CRs and 2 PRs; 3 of 4 of these responses were ongoing at the time of data 
cutoff.  Three additional patients had clinical benefit in the settin g of a nonclassical 
response, with durable regression of target lesions, even though new lesions developed.  
Pharmacodynamic changes associated with PD-L1 inhibition included transient 
increases in the number of activated, proliferating CD8+ T cells and increased levels of 
interleukin-18.  After initial evidence of activity in triple negative breast cancer subjects in 
a phase 1/2 study, atezolizumab was evaluated in combination with nab-paclitaxel in a 
randomized  phase 3 trial ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) of [ADDRESS_372289] cancer who were randomized 1:1 to atezolizumab plus 
nab-paclitaxel or placebo plus nab -paclitaxel .  Median OS in the atezolizumab plus 
nab-paclitaxel arm was 21.3 months, and in the placebo plus nab -paclitaxel arm 
was 17.6 months (Hazard ratio for death, 0.84; P = 0.08); in patients with PD-L1 
positive tumors, the median OS was 25.0 months for the atezolizumab plus nab-
paclitaxel arm and 15.5 months for the placebo plus nab -paclitaxel arm (Hazard 
ratio 0.62).   The rate of grade 3 or 4 adverse events was 48.7% in the atezolizumab 
plus nab-paclitaxel group and 42.2% in the placebo plus nab -paclitaxel group, with 
the most common being neutropenia, decreased neutrophil count, peripheral 
neuropathy, fatigue, and an emia.   57.3% in the atezolizumab plus nab-paclitaxel 
group and 41.8% in the placebo plus nab- paclitaxel group had an adverse event of 
special interest, suggestive of a potential immune -related etiology.  Grade [ADDRESS_372290] occurred in 7.5% in the atezolizumab plus 
nab-paclitaxel group and 4.3% in the placebo plus nab -paclitaxel group.   One 
grade [ADDRESS_372291] (autoimmune hepatitis) occurred in the 
atezolizumab plus nab-paclitaxel group, and one grade [ADDRESS_372292] 
(hepatic failure) occurred in the placebo plus nab-paclitaxel group.   Adverse 
events that led to discontinuation of any agent occurred in 15.9% of subjects who 
received atezolizumab plus nab-paclitaxel, and in 8.2% of subjects who received 
placebo plus nab -paclitaxel.  6.4% discontinued atezolizumab because of adverse 
events, and 1.4% discontinued placebo because of adverse events.   Based on the 
results of this trial, on March 8, 2019, the [LOCATION_002] ( US) Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) granted accelerated approval for atezolizumab in 
combination with nab -paclitaxel for initial treatment of adult patients with 
unresectable locally advanced or metastatic triple negative breast cancer whose 
tumors express PD-L1, as determined by [CONTACT_13247]-appr oved test.

PD-L1 staining in the tumor stroma or in ≥ 1% of tumor cells.  Most patients treated with 
pembrolizumab had received 1 to 3 prior chemotherapy regimens for metastatic disease, 
and 21.9% had received 5 or more.  Patients received pembrolizumab at a dose of 
10 mg/kg intravenously (IV) every 2 weeks.  Adverse events were generally 
manageable, with 5 grade 3/4 toxicities.  There was also 1 treatment-related death due 
to disseminated intravascular coagulation.  The ORR for 27 evaluable patients was 
18.5%, including 1 CR and 2 partial response (PR).   The median time to response was 
18 weeks (range, 7 to 32 weeks), with the median DOR not reached.  The 6-month PFS 
rate was 23.3%. 
Preclinical data with engineered oncolytic viruses have shown efficacy in breast cancer 
tumor models ( Cody et al, 2015).  Fourteen patients with breast cancer were treated in 
the first-in-human study with talimogene laherparepvec ( Hu et al, 2006).  Overall safety 
and evidence of efficacy (evidenced by [CONTACT_304369]) in biopsy specimens was demonstrated.  Some breast cancer patients 
showed stable disease (SD) in the injected lesions and/or shrinkage of both injected and 
adjacent uninjected tumor lesions.  Additionally, the oncolytic herpes simplex virus 
type 1 (HSV-1) mutant (HF10) has been used in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_304323] [ADDRESS_372294] cancer and was shown to be well 
tolerated ( Kimata et al, 2006 ).  A follow-up study showed histological evidence of viral 
replication and CD8+ lymphocyte infiltration in injected tumors ( Sahin et al, 2012 ).  
A phase 2 study of reolysin for patients with advanced/metastatic breast cancer is 
ongoing  ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  
2.1.3  Metastatic Colorectal Cancer 
Colorectal cancer incidence rates vary worldwide, with rates per 100,000 among males 
ranging from 4 in India to 59 in the Czech Republic ( Center et al, 2009).  Annually in the 
[LOCATION_002], approximately 132,700 people are diagnosed with and 49,700 people die 
from colorectal cancer ( SEER).  The proportion of patients with synchronous liver 
metastases at initial diagnosis is about 15% and the 5-year cumulative metachronous 
liver metastasis rate has been reported to be 4% for stage I tumors, 13% for stage II, 
and 30% for stage III ( Manfredi et al, 2006).  For 3 of 4 cases at diagnosis of liver 
metastasis, the liver is the only metastatic site ( Manfredi et al, 2006).

Microsatellite instability-high  (MSI-H) colorectal cancer comprises approximately 15% of 
sporadic colorectal cancer and most familial colorectal cancer, whereas the remainder 
are microsatellite stable (MSS) ( Smyrk et al, 2001 ).  Cells with abnormal mismatch 
repair function accumulate DNA replication errors.  The high mutational load in MSI-H 
tumors also creates many tumor-specific neoantigens, typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 10 to 50 times those of 
MSS tumors ( Llosa et al, 2015 ).  Llosa and colleagues analyzed surgically resected 
primary sporadic colorectal cancer tissue and found that a subset displayed high 
infiltration of activated CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes as well as activation of additional 
cytokines where nearly all of the tumors of this subset demonstrated microsatellite 
instability .  Compared with MSS tumors, MSI-H tumors highly upregulate expression of 
multiple immune checkpoints, including PD-[ADDRESS_372295] MSI-H colorectal cancers typi[INVESTIGATOR_304324]-stage disease than 
MSS colorectal cancers, the MSI-H subtypes represent only 5% to 6% of the stage IV 
colorectal cancer population ( Lochhead et al, 2013 ).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Immunotherapy in Colorectal Cancer 
Clinically, there is evidence of activity of PD-1 based therapy in colorectal cancer.  In a 
phase 1 study of nivolumab that included 39 patients with various solid tumors, 
1/14 patients with metastatic MSI-H colorectal cancer had a durable CR 
(Brahmer et al, 2012 ).  Interestingly, a pretreatment tumor specimen revealed 
membranous expression of PD-L1 on tumor -infiltrating macrophages and lymphocytes 
and on rare tumor cells, as well as PD -1-positive CD3+ T cells ( Lipson et al , 2013 ).  
Additionally, a phase 2 investigat or-initiated study with 41 patients demonstrated that the 
mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) phenotype is predictive of responses to 
PD-1 blockade.  Administration of pembrolizumab monotherapy resulted in objective 
response of 40% of patients with dMMR colorectal tumors compared with 0% in patients 
with MMR proficient colorectal cancer.  Median PFS and OS were not reached in the 
dMMR colorectal cancer cohort versus 2.2 and 5.0 months in the MMR proficient cohort, 
and somatic mutational burden correlated with PFS (Le et al, 2015 ).  Based on this and 
other data, the U.S. FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to 
pemb rolizumab for the treatment of patients with MSI-H metastatic colorectal cancer , 
and on [ADDRESS_372296]:  Talimogene Laherparepvec

Preclinical data has suggested that administration of replicati on competent HSV-1 
oncolytic virus to nude rat tumors was successful in suppressing tumor growth and killing 
human colorectal cancer cells efficiently ( Kooby [CONTACT_2297] , 1999 ).  A phase 1 study of 
intravenous reolysin (non-enveloped human reovius) in combination with folinic 
acid-fluorouracil-irinotecan (FOLFIRI) and bevacizumab in FOLFIRI-naive patients with 
KRAS mutant metastatic colorectal cancer is currently ongoing .  The primary endpoint is 
safety, and the secondary en dpoint examines biomarkers and efficacy parameters

virus with a disrupted thymidine kinase (tk) gene to improve selectivity for cancer and 
insertions of human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) for 
immune stimulation and β-galactosidase for assessment of replication.  It was 
administered intratumorally (IT) in a phase 1 trial to 14 subjects with primary 
hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC) or metastatic liver tumors (non-HCC) in a dose 
escalation study ( Park et al, 2008 ).  DLT occurred at the highest dose of 3 x 109 plaque 
forming unit (PFU) with grade [ADDRESS_372299] and grade 3 anorexia and abdominal pain.  Thus, 109 PFU 
was determined as the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).  No treatment-related deaths 
occurred.  All subjects had grade 1 to 2 flu-like symptoms.  Of 10 evaluable subjects, 
3 had a PR (lung squamous cell carcinoma, HCC, and melanoma), and 6 had SD by

days 1, 15, and 29 ( Heo et al, 2013 ).  Treatment was generally well tolerated at both

grade 3 event was pyrexia which occurred in 19% of subjects treated at the 109 PFU 
dose, and 1 grade 4 event of lymphopenia occurred at the 109 PFU dose.  The trial was 
stopped early due to significant survival benefit favor ing the higher-dose group

modified Choi responses between the higher and lower dose (7% vs 23% and 57% vs

days 1 (intravenous), 8 (IT), 22 (IT), and weeks 6 (IT), 12 (IT), 18 (IT) vs best supportive 
care in 120 second-line advanced subjects with HCC refractory or intolerant to sorafenib 
did not meet its primary endpoint of OS ( Transgene, 2013 ).  However, a pi[INVESTIGATOR_30338] [ADDRESS_372304] line setting for

Talimogene laherparepvec is a virally-based oncolytic immunotherapy consisting of an 
immune-enhanced HSV-1 that selectively replicates in solid tumors.  In this genetically 
modified strain, the HSV-1 viral genes encoding ICP 34.5 (a neurovirulence factor) and 
ICP47 (which blocks viral antigen presentation to major histocompatibility complex 
class I) have been functionally deleted.  The coding sequence for GM-CSF has been 
inserted in place of ICP34.5 and is intended to enhance the immune response to tumor 
antigens released after virus replication and lytic tumor cell death.  Thus, talimogene 
laherparepvec has 2 mechanisms of action: (a) direct oncolysis of infected tumor cells

which states that talimogene laherparepvec has not been shown to improve overall 
survival or have an effect on visceral metastases.  Additionally, in the European Union, 
talimogene laherparepvec (Imlygic®) has been approved for the treatment of adults with 
unresectable melanoma that is regionally or distantly metastatic (Stage IIIB, II IC, and 
IVM1a) with no bone, brain, lung or other visceral disease.  
As of [ADDRESS_372306] received talimogene laherparepvec 
with approximately 761 patients having received talimogene laherparepvec in research 
studies and approximately 350 people were prescribed talimogene laherparepvec 
(IMLYGIC®) after it was approved for sale in the [LOCATION_002]. 
In the First -in-Human Study, 001/01, talimogene laherparepvec was administered in 
single ascending doses of 106, 107, or 108 plaque forming unit (PFU)/mL (up to 4 mL) to 
subjects with breast cancer, colorectal cancer, head and neck cancer, and melanoma 
with refractory cutaneous or subcutaneous metastases ( Hu et al, 2006 ).  In the first 
[ADDRESS_372307] dose (108 PFU/mL), only HSV-[ADDRESS_372308] dose of 106 PFU/mL, 
followed by 2 doses of 108PFU/mL.  Febrile responses were minimal.  Of the 
17 subjects, 7 subjects were HSV-1 seronegative at baseline but within 21 days 
(3 weeks) after the initial dose of 106 PFU/mL was administered, 6 of the 7 subjects 
seroconverted.  Based on these findings, to facilitate tolerance, enable seroconversion, 
and ensure consistency in dosing, the recommended dose in adults (both HSV-1 
seropositive and seronegative groups) was established to be 106 PFU/mL followed by 
108 PFU/mL 21 days (3 weeks) later.  Subsequent dosing could safely be administered 
every 14 days (2 weeks).

Date:  [ADDRESS_372309] study to evaluate the activity of talimogene laherparepvec in melanoma was the 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_44767].  In this open-label, phase 3 study, 436 subjects with stages lllB to 
IV unresectable melanoma were randomized 2:1 to intralesional talimogene 
laherparepvec or subcutaneous GM-CSF.  Treatment was administered until complete 
response (CR), clinically significant disease progression, intolerable side effects, 
12 months of therapy without an objective response, or withdrawal of consent.  The 
primary endpoint of the OPTiM study was DRR, defined as the rate of subjects with an 
objective response by [CONTACT_9559] (CR or PR) lasting continuously for 6 months and 
starting any time within 12 months of initiating therapy.  Secondary endpoints included 
OS, BOR, modified PFS, and changes in tumor burden and safety. 
Primary analysis of the OPTiM study showed a statistically significant difference 
between the DRR among subjects treated with talimogene laherparepvec (16%; 
95% confidence interval [CI]:  12%, 21%) versus tho se treated with GM-CSF (2%; 
95% CI:  0%, 5% ; p value < 0.0001).  Overall response rate was 26.4% (CR 10.8%) for 
talimogene laherparepvec vs 5.7% (CR 0.7%) for GM-CSF (p value < 0.0001 
descriptive).  Median OS among subjects treated with talimogene laherparepvec was 
23.[ADDRESS_372310] 
ratio ( HR) of 0.79 and p  value of 0.051 ( Andtbacka et al, 201 5b).  
In a lesion level analysis, 64% and 47% of injected lesions, 34% and 22% of uninjected 
non-visceral lesions, and 15% and 9% of uninjected visceral lesions regressed ≥ 50% 
and 100%, respectively, demonstrating the systemic effect of talimogene laherparepvec 
beyond injected lesions ( Andtbacka et al, 2014, Andtbacka et al, 2015a ). 
The most common side effects in the OPTiM study were chills (talimogene 
laherparepvec, 49%; GM-CSF, 9%), pyrexia (43%; 9%), injection-site pain (28%; 6%), 
nausea (36%; 20%), influenza-like illness (30%; 15%), and fatigue (50%; 36%).  Grade 
≥ 3 adverse events occurred in 36% of subjects receiving talimogene laherparepvec and 
21% of subjects receiving GM -CSF.  The only grade 3/4 adverse events occurring in 
≥ 5 subjects was cellulitis (talimogene laherparepvec, n=6 [2.1%]; GM-CSF, n=1 [<1%]).  
Of 10 fatal adverse events in the talimogene laherparepvec arm, eight were attributable 
to disease progression.  The remaining two fatal adverse events (sepsis in the setting of 
salmonella infection; myocardial infarction) were not considered treatment-related per 
investigator ( Andtbacka et al, 2015a ).

The injection of talimogene laherparepvec into visceral tumors has been studied in the 
005/[ADDRESS_372311] therapy or could not receive/refused standard therapy ( Chang et al, 2012 ).  
There were 17 subjects who received endoscopic US guided injections into their 
pancreatic tumors at either 1 dose of 104 PFU/mL followed by 2 doses of 105 PFU/mL 
every 3 weeks (cohort 1, n=3), 1 dose of 105 PFU/mL followed by 2 doses of 
106 PFU/mL every 3 weeks (cohort 2, n=4), or 1 dose of 106 PFU/mL followed by 
2 doses of 107 PFU/mL every 3 weeks (cohort 3, n=10).  A fourth dose schedule of 
106 PFU/mL followed by 2 doses of 108 PFU/mL every [ADDRESS_372312]-dose computed 
tomography (CT) scans achieved substantial size reductions (-36% and -33%) in 
injected tumors.  No subjects in the lower dose cohorts (n = 2 evaluable subjects in each 
cohort) showed clinically relevant size reductions of the injected tumors, suggesting a 
dose trend for response of injected tumors.  Three subjects also showed decreases in 
the diameters of 1 or more uninjected tumors (in the liver, pancreas, kidney, and chest) 
at any point in the study, and [ADDRESS_372313] version 1.0, no 
subjects achieved an overall CR or PR; 3 subjects ( 2 in cohorts 1 and 1 in cohort 3) had 
an assessment of overall SD at 1 or more time points.  
Eight subjects (47%) had at least 1 treatment-emergent adverse event considered 
related to talimogene laherparepvec.  Treatment-related adverse events included 
pyrexia in 3 subjects; abdominal pain, ascites, influenza-like illness, and dehydration in 
2 subjects; and constipation, vomiting, chills, pain, headache, weight decrease, and 
diarrhea in [ADDRESS_372314] each.  Grade 3 treatment-related adverse events included 
abdominal pain (12%), ascites (12%), and dehydration (6%); all occurred in cohort 3.  
Eleven deaths were reported, mostly due to pancreatic cancer-related complications.  
One subject with a fatal outcome had an adverse event of ascites considered possibly 
related to study treatment by [CONTACT_093].  This subject was hospi[INVESTIGATOR_304325] [ADDRESS_372315]:  Talimogene Laherparepvec

disease progression and received home hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3677]; the event of ascites was ongoing 
at the time of the subject’s death approximately 1 month later. 
There are currently 4 ongoing combinat ion immunotherapy studies with talimogene 
laherparepvec and a checkpoint inhibitor in advanced stage melanoma.  One is a phase 
1b/2 study of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_304326] ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  In the phase 1b portion, 18 of 19 subjects (more than half 
with visceral disease) received both talimogene laherparepvec and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_304327].  Full dose of talimogene laherparepvec and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 3 mg/kg every 
3 weeks starting week 6 were tolerable.  Per immune-related response criteria (data 
cutoff of 22 December 2014), the ORR in 18 evaluable subjects was 56% (33% CRs), 
and the DRR was 44%.  Median PFS was 10.6 months (2.6 to 19.3+ months).  Median 
OS was not reached; 12-month and 18-months survival rates were 72.2% and 67%, 
respectively.  On a lesion level, 8 and 5 of 16 uninjected index lesions regressed ≥ 50% 
and 100%, respectively.  Grade 3/4 treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 32% 
of subjects, and grade 3/4 immune-related adverse events occurred in two subjects 
(grade 3 hypophysitis and adrenal insufficiency; and grade 4 amylase + lipase 
elevations).  There were no treatment-related deaths ( Puzanov  et al, 201 4).  Another 
study is a phase 1b/3 multicenter open-label trial of talimoge ne laherparepvec in 
combination with pembrolizumab for treatment of unresected, stage IIb to IVM1c 
melanoma ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  In the phase 1b portion of the study, subjects with stage 
IIB-IV melanoma with injectable les ions and no prior systemic therapy received up to 
4.0 mL of talimogene laherparepvec monotherapy for 2 doses followed by [CONTACT_304371] 2 weeks thereafter.  All 21 evaluable subjects 
had an adverse event :  29% grade 3, no grade 4 and one grade 5 (not treatm ent 
related).  The most common adverse events by [CONTACT_304372] (52%), 
pyrexia (48%), chills (43%), and rash (38%).  Of 16 subjects evaluable for response, the 
unconfirmed response rate per investigator was 56%; DCR was 69% (12.5% CR, 
44% PR, 12.5% SD) (Long et al, 2015). 
The hepatotoxicity of talimogene laherparepvec administration in the liver has been 
evaluated in immunocompetent rats.  Up to 107 PFU of talimogene laherparepvec per 
animal or vehicle was administered via intrahepatic artery injection.  No differences in 
morbidity or mortality were noted between talimogene laherparepvec and vehicle treated 
groups ([COMPANY_010] data on file).  Additionally, a dose escalating hepatic injection study with 
talimogene laherparepvec into HCC and metastatic liver tumors is currently ongoing

administered intrahepatically into non-HCC liver metastases at up to 4 mL of 
106 PFU/mL initial dose followed 3 weeks later by [CONTACT_8622] 4 mL of 108 PFU/mL every

2.[ADDRESS_372316] Background:  Atezolizumab 
Atezolizumab is a humanized immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 monoclonal antibody that targets 
PD-L1 and inhibits the interaction between PD -L1 and its receptors  , PD-1 and B7-1 
(also known as CD80), both of which function as inhibitory receptors expressed on 
T cells.  Therapeutic blockade of PD-L1 binding by [CONTACT_304373]-specific T-cell responses, resulting in 
improved anti-tumor activity ( Fehrenbacher et al, 2016 ; Rosenberg et al, 2016 ).  
Atezolizumab has minimal binding to Fc receptors, thus eliminating detectable 
Fc-effector function and associated antibody-mediated clearance of activated effector 
T cells. 
Atezolizumab shows anti-tumor activity in both nonclinical models and cancer patients 
and is being investigated as a potential therapy in a wide variety of malignancies.  
Atezolizumab is being studied as a single agent in the advanced cancer and adjuvant 
therapy settings, as well as in combination with chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and 
cancer immunotherapy. 
Atezolizumab is approved in the [LOCATION_002] and other countries for the treatment of 
urothelial carcinoma and is approved in the [LOCATION_002] for the treatment of non small 
cell lung cancer .  It is also approved in the [LOCATION_002] in combinati on with 
nab-paclitaxel for the treatment of PD -L1 positive triple negative breast cancer  
(refer to the prescribing information for specific indications). 
Refer to the Atezolizumab Investigator’s Brochure  for details on nonclinical and clinical 
studies.

2.4 Rationale 
Talimogene laherparepvec and atezolizumab blockade may play complementary roles in 
regulating adaptive immunity.  Talimogene laherparepvec likely augments dendritic 
cell-mediated tumor antigen presentation through local expression of GM-CSF 
(Kaufman et al, 2010 ) and local antigen release by [CONTACT_44858].  Data indicate that 
the PD-L1/PD-[ADDRESS_372317] cancer.  Its role in 
colorectal cancer is currently being explored.  Atezolizumab is a PD-L1 regulator and 
prevents T cell exhaustion in peripheral tissues. 
The combination of an agent that increases tumor-specific immune activation 
(talimogene laherparepvec) with one that blocks inhibitory T cell checkpoints 
(atezolizumab) could potentially produce greater antitumor activity than either agent 
alone in both triple negative breast cancer and colorectal cancer.  The aim of this study 
is to evaluate safety and explore efficacy of the two agents in combination.

metastases (n = 18 DLT-evaluable subjec ts).  Cohort 2 will comprise subjects with 
colorectal cancer with unresectable liver metastases (n = 18 DLT-evaluable subjects ).  
Subjects will be treated with up to 4.0 mL of 106 PFU/mL talimogene laherparepvec at 
cycle 1, day 1 followed by [CONTACT_304374] 4.0 mL of 108 PFU/mL 
21 ± 3 days later (cycle 2, day 1, week 4 of the study ).  Subsequent cycles of up to 
4.0 mL of 108 PFU/mL talimogene laherparepvec will be given every 21 (+ 3 days) .  The 
first cycle of atezolizumab will be 21 (+ 3) days.  Subsequent cycles of atezolizumab will 
be 21  (± 3) days.  Atezolizumab will be administered intravenously at a dose of 1200 mg.

Before subjects begin participation in any study-specific activities/procedures, [COMPANY_010] 
requires a copy of the site’s written Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Institutional Ethics 
Committee (IEC) approval of the protocol, informed consent form, and all other subject 
information and/or recruitment material, if applicable (see Section 11.2).  All subjects or 
legally acceptable representatives must personally sign and date the IRB/IEC and 
[COMPANY_010] approved informed consent form before commencement of study-specific 
activities/procedures.   
A subject is considered enrolled when the investigator decides that the subject has met 
all eligibility criteria.  The investigator is to document this decision and date, in the 
subject’s medical record and in/on the enrollment case report form (C RF). 
Each subject who enters into the screening period for the study ( defined when the 
subject signs the informed consent) receives a unique subject identification number 
before any study-related activities/procedures are performed.  The subject identification 
number will be assigned by [CONTACT_304377]/web response system (Ix RS).  This 
number will be used to identify the subject throughout the clinical study and must be 
used on all study documentation related to that subject.  Subjects who are determined 
not eligible after screening must be screen-failed in the Ix RS system and the reason for 
the screen-failure provided.  Subjects who do not meet all eligibility criteria may be

laherparepvec is supplied as a sterile frozen liquid in a single-use 2-cc Crystal Zenith vial 
with a gray Fluorotec®-coated chlorobutyl elastomer stopper, aluminum seal, and 
polypropylene cap.  Each vial contains a minimum of 1.0 mL talimogene laherparepvec 
at either 106 PFU/mL or 108 PFU/mL concentrations.  The supply for the 106 PFU/mL 
concentration will be packaged separately from the supply for the 108 PFU/mL 
concentration. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Dosage, Administration, and Schedule 
Talimogene laherparepvec must be prepared and administered by a qualified healthcare 
professional.  Subjects should be assessed clinically for adverse events/toxicity prior to 
each dose using the CTCAE version 4 ( Appendix A).  Hematology, chemistry and 
coagulation panels should be obtained according to the Schedule of Assessments 
(Table 7-1 ) and the results should be checked before each treatment administration.  
Dosing will occur only if these test values are acceptable, per Section [IP_ADDRESS] . 
Talimogene laherparepvec will be administered by [CONTACT_44838] (either 
ultrasound or CT) into injectable liver lesions.  The first cycle of talimogene 
laherparepvec will be 21 (+ 3) days.  Subsequent cycles of talimogene laherparepvec 
will be 21 (+/- 3 days).  On cycle 1, day 1, the first dose of talimogene laherparepvec will 
be up to 4.0 mL of 106 PFU/mL.  During the second cycle, talimogene laherparepvec w ill 
be administered up to 4.0 mL of 108 PFU/mL at week 4 of the study (± 3 days).  During 
subsequent cycles, talimogene laherparepvec will be administered up to 4.0 mL of 
108 PFU/mL every 21 days (± 3 days) thereafter.

The maximum volume of talimogene laherparepvec to be administered at any treatment 
visit is 4.0 mL for any individual tumor lesion or for all tumor lesions combined .  
Investigators are encouraged to use the maximum amount when tumor lesion s allow.   
The recommended volume of talimogene laherparepvec to be injected into the tumor(s) 
depends on the longest diameters of the tumor(s) and necrotic core of the tumor(s) 
(if applicable) and should be dosed according to the injection volume guideline in 
Table 6-[ADDRESS_372363].  Thus, there are two separate dosing guidelines depending on 
whether there is a significantly sized necrotic core (the longest diameter of the necrotic 
core is ≥ 75% of the longest diameter of the tumor) or not ( Table 6-1 ).  When 
determining the percent of the tumor diameter that is necrotic, measurements from the 
most recent multiphase CT or MRI should be used.  However, th e longest diameters of 
tumors assessed by [CONTACT_304378] 6-[ADDRESS_372364] should not be injected with 
talimogene laherparepvec regardless of the overall tumor size.

on study radiographic assessment at week 10 (cycle 4).    
New liver lesions that have been identified on injection guidance CT scans or ultrasound 
between scheduled tumor assessments should not be treated with talimogene 
laherparepvec until they have been visualized on tumor assessment CT or MRI s cans 
and documented in the CRF.  
After the first radiographic assessment at week 10 (cycle 4), if all injectable liver lesions 
have been injected , but the 4.0 mL maximum volume has not been used, injection of 
clinically assessed non-hepatic cutaneous, subcutaneous, and nodal tumor lesions with 
or without ultrasound guidance will be permitted.  Liver lesions should be prioritized over 
cutaneous, subcutaneous and nodal lesions.  
After the initial 6 intrahepatic cycles, there is an option to continue treatment 
with talimogene laherparepvec for an additional 6  cycles .  During this additional 
dosing period (week 19 [cycle 7] to week 34 [cycle 12]), talimogene laherparepvec may 
be administered, by [CONTACT_304362], 
subcutaneous and nodal tumor lesions , or both.  For weeks 19 to 34 (cycles 7 to 12), 
liver lesions do not need to be prioritized.  A maximum of 12 cycles (34 weeks) 
of talimogene laherparepvec are allowed during the study.  
The longest diameters of tumors assessed on the day of each treatment should be used 
to determine the maximum injection volumes per Table 6-2  for cutaneous, subcutaneous

 Any new injectable metastatic liver lesion that has appeared on tumor assessment 
CT or MRI scans since the start of treatment (from newest to oldest).   
 Metastatic liver lesions by [CONTACT_44871], beginning with the largest tumor. 
 Any metastatic liver lesion seen on tumor assessment that was previously too small 
to inject that has now become large enough to inject. 
 Injection of non-hepatic lesions (cutaneous, subcutaneous, and nodal tumor lesions) 
is allowed after the first radiographic assessment at week 10 (ie, after 3 doses) if 
volume remains after injecting liver lesions.  
 After the first 6 cycles (16 weeks), liver lesions do not need to be prioritized. 
It is recommended that each metastatic lesion should receive the maximum volume of 
talimogene laherparepvec possible to inject based on tumor properties at each visit 
before moving on to the next lesion, using the prioritization model above and injection 
volume guideline based on the size of the tumor lesion .  
Volumes of less than 0.05 mL should not be planned for administration into a tumor 
lesion.  Tumor lesions should be injected until the maximum volume per treatment day 
(4 mL) has been reached, or there are no further injectable tumor lesions, whichever 
comes first. 
The dose, start date, number of vials used per visit, concentration, and lot number of 
talimogene laherparepvec are to be recorded on each subject’s CRF. 
Subjects will undergo a 23-hour observation period following the first [ADDRESS_372369] 2 hours, hourly for the next 4 hours, then once every 4 to 6 hours .  Vital signs should 
also be recorded at the end of the observation period.  The observation period for the

Permanent Discontinuation  
Dose reduction for adverse events is not allowed.  However, if during the process of 
administering talimogene laherparepvec in the clinic, the subject cannot tolerate the full 
dose due to an injection-related adverse event such as pain, the total volume given 
should be recorded, and the reason for intolerance should be documented as an 
adverse event. 
If a subject experiences any of the following treatment-related toxicities, talimogene 
laherparepvec administration should be delayed until the toxicity has resolved to at least 
CTCAE grade 1 or baseline: 
 grade 2 or greater immune-mediated adverse events, with the exception of vitiligo 
 grade 2 or greater allergic reactions (Note:  a grade ≥ 4 rash is considered a DLT if it 
occurs during the DLT evaluation window and requires permanent discontinuation 
per Section [IP_ADDRESS].3 ) 
 any other grade [ADDRESS_372375] an INR of > 1.5 or platelet < 50,000/mm3 (109/L) prior to injection, 
talimogene laherparepvec administration should be delayed until INR is ≤ 1.5 or platelet 
≥ 50,000/mm3 (109/L) without transfusion.  Any planned correction of INR or platelet 
count with transfusion prior to injection should be approved by [CONTACT_304383] . 
If a subject requires corticosteroid dosing of >10 mg prednisone daily (or equivalent), for 
treatment of atezolizumab adverse events or other reason, talimogene laherparepvec 
dosing must be withheld until the corticosteroid dose has decreased to ≤ 10 mg 
prednisone daily (or equivalent).  
If subject requires tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF- ) inhibitors for treatment of 
atezolizumab immune related adverse events, talimogene laherparepvec must be 
withheld until TNF-  inhibitors are discontinued. 
All necessary supportive care shall be available to subjects except for those listed in 
Section 6.9.  Talimogene laherparepvec treatment should be continued based on the 
potential risk/benefit assessment of the subject.

(ie, approximately 9 weeks from the previous cycle) for reasons other than talimogene 
laherparepvec related adverse event (eg, delay due to necessitation of corticosteroids 
for management of atezolizumab adverse event), the investigator must contact [CONTACT_304384] m onitor , to determine if the subject can resume talimogene 
laherparepvec therapy without compromis ing the subject’s safety. 
Talimogene laherparepvec is to be permanently discontinued for subjects meeting any of 
the following criteria: 
 Subject developed a DLT during the DLT evaluation period. 
 Possible DILI requiring permanent wit hholding of talimogene laherparepvec as per 
Section 6.4. 
 The subject, for any reason, requires treatment with alternative anti-cancer agent.  In 
this case, discontinuation from investigational product(s) should occur immediately 
upon introduction of the new agent.  
 Confirmed PD occurs as defined per modified irRC-RECIST.    
 A grade 2 or greater immune-mediated adverse event (with the exception of vitiligo) 
or allergic reactions attributed to talimogene laherparepvec that would require a dose 
delay of greater than 2 cycles (ie, 6 weeks) from the date of the planned dose 
(ie, approximately 9 weeks from the previous cycle ). 
Note:  immune-mediated glomerulonephritis, vasculitis, and pneumonitis and 
exacerbation of psoriasis have been observed in subjects receiving talimogene 
laherparepvec in clinical trials.  Most of these subjects had a history of other 
autoimmune disease and/or prior treatment with agents that offered plausible 
alternative etiologies; however, immune-mediated adverse events can potentially 
involve any organ system. 
 Any other talimogene laherparepvec-related non-hematologic or hematologic 
toxicities Grade 3 or greater occur that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], would 
require a dose delay of greater than 2 cycles (ie, 6 weeks) from the date of the

[IP_ADDRESS]  Dosage, Administration, and Schedule 
Administration of atezolizumab will be performed in a setting with emergency medical 
facilities and staff who are trained to monitor for and respond to medical emergencies.   
Atezolizumab is preferred to be given prior to talimogene laherparepvec. 
The first cycle of atezolizumab will be 21 (+ 3) days.  Subsequent cycles of atezolizumab 
will be 21 (± 3) days.  The dose level of atezolizumab is [ADDRESS_372379], 
atezolizumab treatment can continue after talimogene laherparepvec treatment has 
ended provided patient is tolerating atezolizumab and receiving clinical benefit in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_871] . 
The initial dose of atezolizumab (day 1, cycle 1) will be delivered over 60 (± 15) minutes.  
If the first dose is tolerated without infusion-associated adverse events, the second dose 
(cycle 2) may be delivered over 30 ( ± 10) minutes.  If the 30-minute intravenous infusion 
is well tolerated, all subsequent doses may be delivered over 30 (± 10) minutes .  The 
subjects’ vital signs (heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], blood pressure, and temperature) 
should be determined up to [ADDRESS_372380] dose of atezolizumab.  Premedication per 
Section 6.5 may be administered for subsequent doses at the discretion of the 
investigator and should be documented in the CRF. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Dosage Adjustments, Delays, Rules for Withholding or Restarting, 
Permanent Discontinuation 
There will be no dose reduction for atezolizumab in this study.   
If either atezolizumab or talimogene laherparpevec is delayed due to toxicity, the 
treatment cycle must be delayed until both investigational products can be administered 
safely in combination.  If either atezolizumab or talimogene laherparpevec requires a 
delay of more than 2 cycles (ie, 6 weeks ), because of drug toxicity, that agent  should be 
permanently discontinued.  
Dose interruptions for reason(s) other than toxicity, such as surgical procedures, may be 
allowed with [COMPANY_010] medical monitor approval.  The acceptable length of interruption will 
depend on agreement between the investig ator and the [COMPANY_010] medical m onitor .

normalized ratio [INR] and/or signs/symptoms of hepatitis as described in Sections 6.4.1  
and 6.4.2 ) may meet the criteria for withholding or permanent discontinuation of 
investigational product(s) (talimogene laherparepvec and/or atezolizumab) as specified 
in the [LOCATION_002] Food and Drug Administration Guidance for Industry Drug-Induced 
Liver Injury [DILI]:  Premarketing Clinical Evaluation, July 2009 ).  Immune-mediated 
hepatitis has been associated with the administration of atezolizumab.  In subjects with 
impaired liver tests, concurrent medications, viral hepatitis, and toxic or neoplastic 
etiologies should be considere d and addressed, as appropriate.  Imaging of the liver, gall 
bladder, and biliary tree should be performed to rule out neoplastic or other causes for 
increasing liver test values.  Anti-nuclear antibody, perinuclear anti-neutrophil 
cytoplasmic antibody, an ti-liver kidney microsomal antibodies, and anti-smooth muscle 
antibody tests should be performed if an autoimmune etiology is considered.  
Additionally, appropriate biopsies should be performed if appropriate whenever possible.

is to be followed according to recommendations in Appendix A for possible DILI.  
Rechallenge may be considered if an alternative cause for impaired liver tests (AL T, 
AST, ALP and/or elevated total bilirubin), is discovered and the laboratory abnormalities 
resolve to normal or baseline (Section 6.4.3 ).   
6.4.3  Criteria for Rechallenge of Talimogene Laherparepvec and/or 
Atezolizumab After Potential Hepatotoxicity 
The decision to rechallenge the subject should be discussed and agreed upon 
unanimously by [CONTACT_304388]. 
If signs or symptoms recur with rechallenge, then talimogene laherparepvec and/or 
atezolizumab should be permanently discontinued.  Subjects who clearly meet the 
criteria for permanent discontinuation (as describe d in Section 6.4.1 ) should never be 
rechallenged without discussing with the [COMPANY_010] medical monitor. 
6.5 Concomitant Therapy 
Throughout the study, investigators may prescribe any concomitant medications or 
treatments deemed necessary to provide adequate supportive care except for those 
listed in  Section 6.9. 
Subjects who experience atezolizumab infusion-associated symptoms may be treated 
symptomatically with acetaminophen, diphenhydramine, and/or famotidine or another 
H2 receptor antagonist, as per standard practice (for sites outside the [LOCATION_002], 
equivalent medications may be substituted per local practice).  Serious atezolizumab

effective contraception (as described in the table below) during treatment and for an 
additional [ADDRESS_372401] dose of talimogene laherparepvec or atezolizumab.   
Acceptable Methods of Effective Contraception for Female Subjects  
 Combined (estrogen and progestogen) or Progestogen -only hormonal methods 
given via oral, transdermal, injectable, or implantable route)  
 Intrauterine device (IUD)  
 Intrauterine hormonal -releasing system (IUS)  
 Bilateral tubal ligation/occlusion  
 Vasectomized partner (Provided that partner is the sole sexual partner of the female 
subject of childbearing potential and that the vasectomized partner has received 
medical assessment of the surgical success)  
 Sexual abstinence (Defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the 
entire period of risk associated with the study treatments.  The reliability of sexual 
abstinence must be evaluated in relation to the duration of the trial and the preferred 
and usual lifestyle of the subject.)  
 Double barrier method:  the male uses a condom and the female may choose either 
a cap, diaphragm, or spo nge with spermicide.  (A female condom is not an option 
due to the risk of tearing when both partners use a condom.)

a After the initial 6 intrahepatic cycles of talimogene laherparepvec, there is an option to continue treatment with talimogene laherparepvec for an addit ional 6 cycles.  
During this add
itional dosing period (cycles 7 to 12), tali mogene laherparepvec may be administered, by [CONTACT_304389], 
subcutaneous and nodal tumor lesion, or both.  For cycles [ADDRESS_372404], atezolizumab treatment can continue after 
talimogene laherparepvec treatment has ended provided patient is tolerating atezolizumab and receiving clinical benefit in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871].  
b Safety follow- up will be performed approximately 30 (+ 7) days after the last dose of study treatment.  
c Subjects will be followed for survival every 12 weeks (± 28 days ) from the date of the safety follow-up visit until up to approximately [ADDRESS_372405] results (including date of testing and assay used) are to be recorded in a 
separate eCRF at the time of enrollment or at the subsequent time that the results become available.  See Section 7.3.[ADDRESS_372406] 2 hours, hourly for the next 4 hours, then once every 4 to 6 hours.  Vital signs should also be recorded at the end of the observation period.  After the fourth dose 
of talimogene laherparepvec, the observation period for subsequent doses may be reduced to a minimum of 6 hours at the investigator’s discretion with vital signs 
recorded every [ADDRESS_372407] 2 hours and hourly for the next 4 hours and once at the end of the observational period.   The subjects’ vital signs (heart rate, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], blood pressure, and temperature) should be determined up to [ADDRESS_372408] guidelines 
are met .  Blood samples for tumor biomarkers are to be collected prior to administration of investigational agent/s per Schedule of Assessments.  Tumor marker 
measurements should be performed according to institutional guidelines and availability.   
j Liver tumor biopsies:  screening biopsy should only be performed for those subjects who have no prior biopsy to confirm that their disease is one of the eligible tumor 
types.  Those that have had prior pathology reports supporting their diagnosis do not need screening biopsy.  During treatment liver tumor biopsies will be performed 
immediately prior talimogene laherparepvec administration at weeks 1, 7, and 16.  Screening biopsy may be used for baseline (week 1) biopsy if the subject is 
eligible, provided enough tissue has been obtained.  One injected lesion should be biopsied at each time point.  If there are uninjected lesions that are suitable for 
biopsy at week 7 and/or week 16, one uninjected lesion should also be biopsied at that time prior to talimogene laherparepvec administration. 
k Blood will be collected for biomarker analysis prior to any study drug (atezolizumab and talimogene laherparepvec) administration and approximately 4 hours 
(± 30 minutes) following talimogene laherparepvec administration. 
l CT/MRI brain required at screening for triple negative breast cancer subjects.  An MRI scan of the brain is required to confirm or refute the diagnosis of CNS 
metastases at baseline in the event of an equivocal scan.  Only colorectal cancer subjects with signs/symptoms for CNS metastases need to have brain imaging.  
During treatment, radiographic tumor imaging and clinical tumor assessments will be performed independent of treatment cycle at week 10 (± 1 week) and then every 
9 weeks (± 1 week) until confirmed disease progression (PD).   Of note, atezolizumab is permitted to continue beyond confirmed PD in which case radiographic tumor 
imaging should continue until the subject discontinues treatment.  Radiographic imaging is only required at the  safety follow-up visit if subject ended treatment prior to 
documentation of confirmed PD per modified irR C-RECIST and has not had radiographic tumor imaging performed within 9 (± 1) weeks of the visit and has not 
started new anti-cancer therapy.  In the case that the subject discontinues therapy prior to documentation of confirmed PD per modified irRC-RECIST, every effort 
should be made to complete radiog
raphic assessments during the long-term follow-up approximately every 12 weeks ( + 28 days) until documented confirmed PD per 
modified irRC
-RECIST, start of new anticancer treatment, death, or end of study, whichever occurs first.

Clinical measurements of cutaneous, subcutaneous, and palpable nodal tumor lesions 
by [CONTACT_304393].  
For the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_3606] a ruler to 
estimate the size of the lesion is suggested  to aid tracking.   Photographs are not 
required for the study; therefore, photographic equipment will not be provided.  
Clinically applicable tumor measurements include but are not limited to cancer antigen  
27.29  (CA 27.29), cancer antigen 15-3 (CA 15-3), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and 
cancer antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) .  Blood samples for tumor biomarkers are to be collected 
prior to administration of investigational agent/s per Schedule of Assessments 
(Table 7-1 ).  Tumor marker measurements should be performed according to 
institutional guidelines and availability .  Tumor marker measurement is required to 
confirm CR if screening level of tumor marker was above the ULN and criteria for CR per 
modified irRC-RECIST guidelines are met. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Radiographic Tumor Assessment 
All known sites of disease must be documented at screening and reassessed at each 
subsequent tumor evaluation. 
Screening assessments must include CT scans (with oral/IV contrast unless 
contraindicated) or MRI of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.  A spi[INVESTIGATOR_304347] a requireme nt.  An MRI or a non-contrast CT scan of the 
chest, abdomen, and pelvis may be used in subjects for whom CT scans with contrast

Date:  [ADDRESS_372421] (with contrast) or MRI scan of the brain must be done at screening to evaluate 
CNS metastasis in all  subjects with triple negative breast cancer .  A brain scan is only 
required for colorectal cancer subjects if they present with signs/symptoms of CNS 
metastasis.  An MRI scan of the brain is required to confirm or refute the diagnosis of 
CNS metastases at baseline in the event of an equivocal scan.  Subjects with active or 
untreated CNS metastases are not eligible for this study.  
If a CT scan for tumor assessment is performed in a positron emission tomography 
(PET)/CT scanner, the CT acquisition must be consistent with the standards for a 
full-contrast diagnostic CT scan. 
Bone scans should also be performed if clinically indicated.  At the investigator’s 
discretion, other methods of assessment of measurable disease as per modified 
irRC-RECIST may be used (Appendix D). 
The same radiographic procedure used to assess disease sites at screening should be 
used throughout the study (e g, the same contrast protocol for CT scans).  All known 
sites of disease must be documented at screening and re-assessed at each subsequent 
tumor evaluation.  Response will be assessed by [CONTACT_304394]-RECIST criteria (Appendix D).  Assessments should be performed by [CONTACT_304395]. 
7.4 Laboratory Assessments  
On-treatment tests can be performed within 3 days of the treatm ent visit.  Results should 
be reviewed prior to the administration of study treatment.  All tests (except for real-time 
polymerase chain reaction [qPCR], HSV-1 antibody , archival tumor sample, liver tumor 
biopsy and blood for biomarkers) are to be performe d at the local laboratory.   Specific 
analytes for serum chemistry, coagulation, hematology, urinalysis, and other testing to 
be conducted on blood, urine and swabs are below ( Table 7-2 ).  During treatment,

include the use of genetic markers to help in the investigation of cancer and/or to identify 
subjects who may have positive or negative responses to talimogene laherparepvec 
and/or atezolizumab .  No additional samples are collected for this part of the study.  For 
subjects who consent to this/these analysis/analyses, DNA may be extracted. 
7.7 Sample Storage and Destruction  
Any blood or tumor sample collected according to the Schedule of Assessments 
(Table 7-1 ) can be analyzed for any of the tests outlined in the protocol and for any tests 
necessary to minimize risks to study subjects.  This includes testing to ensure analytical 
methods produce reliable and valid data throughout the course of the study .  This can 
also include, but is not limited to, investigation of unexpected results, incurred sample 
reanalysis, and analyses for method transfer and comparability.  
All samples and associated results will be coded prior to being shipped from the site for 
analysis or storage.  Samples will be tracked using a unique identifier that is assigned to 
the samples for the study.  Results are stored in a secure database to ensure 
confidentiality.   
If informed consent is provided by [CONTACT_304396], 
[COMPANY_010] can do additional testing on remaining samples (ie, residual and back -up) to 
investigate and better understand the cancer, the dose response and/or prediction of 
response to talimogene laherparepvec and characterize aspects of the molecule 
(eg, mechanism of action/target, metabolites).  Results from this analysis are to be 
documented and maintained, but are not necessarily reported as part of this study.  
Samples can be retained for up to [ADDRESS_372428]:  Talimogene Laherparepvec 
Protocol Number:  20140299  
Date:  [ADDRESS_372429]’s medical record and are not to be made available to the subject, 
members of the family, the personal physician, or other third parties , except as specified 
in the informed consent. 
The subject retains the right to request that the sample material be destroyed by 
[CONTACT_21947].  Following the request from the subject, the investigator is to 
provide the sponsor with the required study and subject number so that any remaining  
blood  samples and any other components from the cells can be located and destroyed.  
Samples will be destroyed once all protocol-defined procedures are completed.  
However, information collected from samples prior to the request for destruction, will be 
retained by [CONTACT_11337]. 
The sponsor is the exclusive owner of any data, discoveries, or derivative materials from 
the sample materials and is responsible for the destruction of the sample(s) at the 
request of the subject through the investigator, at the end of the storage period, or as 
appropriate (eg, the scientific rationale for experimentation with a certain sample type no 
longer justifies keepi[INVESTIGATOR_21878]).  If a commercial product is developed from this 
research project, the sponsor owns the commercial product.  The subject has no 
commercial rights to such product and has no commercial rights to the data, information, 
discoveries, or derivative materials gained or produced from the sample.

9. SAFETY DATA COLLECTION, RECORDING, AND REPORTING 
9.1 Definition of Safety Events 
9.1.1  Disease Related Events 
Disease Related Events are events (serious or non-serious) anticipated to occur in the 
study population due to the underlying disease.   All serious disease related events 
will be recorded and reported to the sponsor or designee within [ADDRESS_372434]’s condition  and/or if 
the investigator believes that the event is related to the investigational product(s)/study 
treatment/protocol-required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. 
Disease related events that would qualify as an adverse event or serious adverse 
event: 
 An event based on the underlying disease that is worse than expected as 
assessed by [CONTACT_44910]’s condition or if the 
investigator believes there is a causal relationship between the 
investigatio nal product(s)/study treatment/protocol-required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_75586], this must be reported as an adverse event or serious 
adverse event. 
Disease related events that do not qualify as adverse events or serious adverse 
events: 
 An event which is part of the normal course of disease under study (eg, 
disease progression in oncology or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_21888]) is to be reported as a disease-related event.    
Approved  
  
Product:  Talimogene Laherparepvec 
Protocol Number:  20140299  
Date:  [ADDRESS_372435]’s medical record.   
The definition of adverse events includes  worsening of a pre-existing medical condition.  
Worsening indicates that the pre -existing medical condition or underlying d isease 
(eg, diabetes, migraine headaches, gout) has increased in severity, frequency, and/or 
duration more than would be expected , and/or has an association with a significantly 
worse outcome than expected.  A pre-existing condition that has not worsened more 
than anticipated (ie, more than usual fluctuation of disease) during the study or involves 
an intervention such as elective cosmetic surgery or a medical procedure while on study , 
is not considered an adverse event.   
Note:  For situations where adverse events are due to metastatic triple negative breast 
cancer or colorectal cancer, the primary tumor type (eg, metastatic cancer) should be 
used, rather than the term “disease progression”.   
The investigator’s clinical judgment is used to determine whether a subject is to be 
removed from treatment due to an adverse event.  In the event a subject, or subject’s 
legally acceptable representative requests to withdraw from protocol-required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_21884] , refer to  Section 8.[ADDRESS_372436] one of the 
following serious criteria: 
 fatal 
 life threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death) 
 requires in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
 results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
 congenital anomaly/birth defect 
 other medically important serious event

CONFIDENTIAL  
A disease related event (eg,  PD or pain or discomfort caused by [CONTACT_304397])  is to 
be reported as a serious adverse event if:  
 the subject’s pre-existing condition becomes worse than what the investigator would 
consider typi[INVESTIGATOR_21885] a patient with the same underlying condition, or 
 if the investigator believes a causal relationship exists between the investigational 
medicinal product(s)/protocol-required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_21886]   
 and the event meets at least one of the serious criteria above 
An adverse event would meet the criterion of “requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]”, if the event 
necessitated an admission to a health care facility (eg, overnight stay).   
If an investigator considers an event to be clinically important, but it does not meet any 
of the serious criteria, the event could be classified as a serious adverse event under the 
criterion of “other medically important serious event”.  Examples of such events could 
include allergic bronchospasm, convulsions, blood dyscrasias, DILI (see Appendix A for 
DILI reporting criteria), or events that necessitate an emergency room visit, outpatient 
surgery, or urgent intervention.

9.2 Safety Event Reporting Procedures  
9.2.1  Reporting Procedures for Disease Related Events 
Disease related events are defined in Section 9.1.1 . 
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all Disease Related Events (serious or 
non-serious) observed by [CONTACT_304398]-up visit 
(ie, 30 [+7] days after the last dose of talimogene laherparepvec or atezolizumab ), are 
recorded on the Event CRF as a Disease-Related Event .   
All serious disease related events will be recorded and reported to the sponsor or 
designee within [ADDRESS_372438] assign the following attributes to each disease related event: 
 Disease related event diagnosis or syndrome(s), if known (if not known, signs or 
symptoms), 
 Dates of onset and resolution (if resolved) 
 Severity (and/or toxicity per protocol) 
 Assessment of relatedness to talimogene laherparepvec and/or atezolizumab and 
 Action taken 
CTCAE version 4 will be used to grade a disease related event.  The grading scale used 
in this study is described in Appendix A.  
Note:  If the event is more severe than expected for the subject’s condition or if the 
investigator believes there is a causal relationship between the investigational 
product(s)/study treatment/protocol-required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_21887], the event 
should be reported as an adverse event, not a disease related event. 
The investigator is expected to follow reported disease related events (serious or 
non-serious) until stabilization or reversibility. 
Disease-Related Events assessed by [CONTACT_44913]/or related to the talimogene laherparepvec or atezolizumab, and determined to be 
serious, must be recorded on the Event CRF as Serious Adverse Events  and be 
recorded and reported per Section 9.1.[ADDRESS_372439]:  Talimogene Laherparepvec

CONFIDENTIAL  
9.2.2  Adverse Events 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reporting Procedures for Adverse Events That Do Not Meet Serious 
Criteria 
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all adverse events observed by [CONTACT_304399] -up visit (ie, 30 [+7] days after 
the last dose of talimogene laherparepvec or atezolizumab) are reported using the Event 
CRF.   
Additionally, talimogene laherparepvec or atezolizumab related adverse events that 
occur after the safety follow-up visit through the end of the long-term follow-up will be 
reported.  
The investigator must assign the following attributes to each adverse event: 
 Adverse event diagnosis or syndrome(s), if known (if not known, signs or symptoms) 
 Dates of onset and resolution (if resolved) 
 Severity (and/or toxicity per protocol) 
 Assessment of relatedness to talimogene laherparepvec and/or atezolizumab 
 Action taken 
The adverse event grading scale used will be the CTCAE version 4.0.  The grading 
scale used in this study is described in Appendix A.   
The investigator must assess whether the adverse event is possibly related to the 
talimogene laherparepvec and/or atezolizumab.  This relationship is indicated by a “yes” 
or “no” response to the question:  Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may 
have been caused by [CONTACT_7198](s)? 
The investigator must assess whether the adverse event is possibly related to any 
study-mandated activity (eg, administration of investigational product, protocol-required 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], use of medical device(s) and/or procedure (including any screening 
procedure(s)).  This relationship is indicated by a “yes” or “no” response to the question:   
“Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by a study 
activity (eg, administration of investigational product, protocol-required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], use of 
medical device(s)), and/or procedure”?  
The investigator is responsible for reviewing laboratory test results and determining 
whether an abnormal value in an individual study subject represents a clinically 
significant change from the subject’s baseline values.  In general, abnormal laboratory

CONFIDENTIAL  
findings without clinical significance (based on the investigator's judgment) are not to be 
recorded as adverse events.  However, laboratory value changes that require treatment 
or adjustment in current therapy are considered adverse events.  Where applicable, 
clinical sequelae (not the laboratory abnormality) are to be recorded as the adverse 
event. 
If the severity of an adverse event changes from the date of onset to the date of 
resolution, record a single event for each level of severity on the Event CRF. 
The investigator is expected to follow reported adverse events until stabilization or 
reversibility.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reporting Procedures for Serious Adverse Events and Adverse 
Events of Special Interest 
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all serious adverse events observed by 
[CONTACT_304400] 90 (+ 7) days  following cessation of treatment , or if the subject initiates 
new anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier are recorded in the subject’ s medical record 
and are submitted to [COMPANY_010] .  Additionally,  talimogene laherparepvec  and/or 
atezolizumab related serious adverse events that occur after the safety follow -up visit 
through the end of the long -term follow -up will be reported.  
All serious adverse events and adverse events of special interest must be submitted to 
[COMPANY_010] within 24 hours following the investigator’s knowledge of the event via the Event 
CRF.   
If the electronic data capture (EDC) system is unavailable to the site sta ff to report the 
serious adverse event, the information is to be reported to [COMPANY_010] via an electronic 
Serious Adverse Event Contingency Report Form within 24 hours of the investigator’s 
knowledge of the event.  See Appendix B for a sample of the Serious Adverse Event 
Worksheet /electronic Serious Adverse Event Contingency Report Form.  For EDC 
studies where the first notification of a Serious Adverse Event is reported to [COMPANY_010] via 
the eSerious Adverse Event Contingency Report Form, the data must be entered into 
the EDC system when the system is available again. 
The investigator must assess whether the serious adverse event is possibly related to 
the investigational product ( talimogene laherparepvec and/or atezolizumab),  medical 
devices,  combination product (s), and/or other protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].   This 
relationship is indicated by a “yes” or “no” response to the question:  “Is there a

protocol-required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]?  Relatedness means that there are facts or reasons to 
support a relationship between investigational product and the event. 
The investigator is expected to follow reported serious adverse events and adverse 
events of special interest until stabiliz ation or reversibility.  
New information relating to a previously reported serious adverse event or adverse 
event of special interest must be submitted to [COMPANY_010] .  All new information for serious 
adverse events or adverse events of special interest must be sent to [COMPANY_010] within 
[ADDRESS_372441] be 
submitted to [COMPANY_010]. 
[COMPANY_010] will report serious adverse events and/or suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions as required to regulatory authorities, investigators/institutions, and IRBs/IECs 
in compliance with all reporting requirements according to local regulations and Good 
Clinical Practice (GCP) .  
The investigator is to notify the appropriate IRB/IEC of serious adverse events occurring 
at the site and other adverse event reports received from [COMPANY_010], in accordance with 
local procedures and statutes. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reporting Serious Adverse Events After the Protocol-required 
Reporting Period 
There is no requirement to monitor study subjects for serious adverse events following 
the protocol -required reporting period or after end of study.  However, these serious 
adverse events can be reported to [COMPANY_010].  In some countries (eg, European Union [EU ] 
member states), investigators are required to report serious adverse events that they 
become aware of after end of study.  If serious adverse events are reported, the 
investigator is to report them to [COMPANY_010] within 24 hours following the investigator’s 
knowledge of the event.

Pregnancy Notification Worksheet ( Appendix C ).  [COMPANY_010] Global Patient Safety will 
follow-up with the investigator regarding additional information that may be requested. 
If a female subject becomes pregnant during the study, the investigator should attempt 
to obtain information regarding the birt h outcome and health of the infant. 
If the outcome of the pregnancy meets a criterion for immediate classification as a 
Serious Adverse Event (eg, female subject experiences a spontaneous abortion, 
stillbirth, or neonatal death or there is a fetal or neonatal congenital anomaly) the 
investigator will report the event as a Serious Adverse Event.

the exposure to [COMPANY_010] as specified below.  In addition to reporting an unintended 
exposure case during the study treatment, investigators should monitor for potential 
exposure cases that occur after the last dose of talimogene laherparepvec through 
30 (+ 7) days after the last dose of talimogene laherparepvec.  
Any potential or known unintended exposure should be reported to [COMPANY_010] within 
24 hours of the investigator’s knowledge of the event of exposure.  [COMPANY_010] will seek to 
follow-up with the exposed individual, if necessary, to collect more information about the 
exposed individual contact [CONTACT_44921], signs and/or symptoms related to 
the exposure, medical history, and/or outcome of the exposur e.  If the exposed individual 
is reporting sign or symptoms suspected to be related to talimogene laherparepvec 
exposure, the exposed individual may be asked to have a swab taken to evaluate for the 
presence of talimogene laherparepvec DNA in the lesion.

10.1.2  Analysis Sets  
[IP_ADDRESS]  DLT Analysis Set  
The DLT analysis set will include DLT-evaluable subjects who have had the opportunity 
to be on treatment for at least [ADDRESS_372445] a DLT during the DLT evaluation period as described in 
Section 3.1. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Safety Analysis Set 
The safety analysis set will include all subjects who received at least 1 dose of 
talimogene laherparepvec or atezolizumab.   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Biomarker Analysis Sets 
Biomarker analysis sets will be defined separately for each individual candidate 
biomarker.  For predictive analyses, the analysis set will include all  subjects in the safety 
analysis set with a baseline biomarker result and, for analyses of biomarker changes, 
the analysis set will include all subjects in the safety analysis set that have baseline and 
at least one subsequent biomarker result. 
10.1.3  Covariates and Subgroups

10.2 Sample Size Considerations 
The null hypothesis (H0) is that the combination of talimogene laherparepvec and 
atezolizumab has a DLT rate ≤ 10%.  An unacceptable alternative hypothesis (Ha) is a 
true DLT rate ≥ 33%.  The sample size goal is to have ≥ 80% power for a 1-sided ≤ 10% 
significance level test to reject H0 when Ha is true 1.   Eighteen DLT-evaluable subjects 
in each cohort will be required to test H0.   Assuming the incidence of DLTs is evaluated 
as specified by [CONTACT_50489] 3-1  in Section 3.1, this design achieves a 7.7% 1-sided 
significance level and 81.6% power. 
10.[ADDRESS_372446] 18 DLT-evaluable

11. REGULATORY OBLIGATIONS 
11.1 Informed Consent 
An initial sample informed consent form is provided for the investigator to prepare the 
informed consent document to be used at his or her site.  Updates to the template are to 
be communicated formally in writing from the [COMPANY_010] Clin ical Study Manager to the 
investigator.  The written informed consent form is to be prepared in the language(s) of 
the potential patient population. 
Before a subject’s participation in the clinical study, the investigator is responsible for 
obtaining written informed consent from the subject or legally acceptable representative 
after adequate explanation of the aims, methods, anticipated benefits, and potential 
hazards of the study and before any protocol-specific screening procedures or any 
investigational product(s) is/are administered.  A legally acceptable representative is an

The investigator is also responsible for asking the subject if the subject has a primary 
care physician and if the subject agrees to have his/her primary care physician informed 
of the subject’s participation in the clinical study.  If the subject agrees to such 
notification, the investigator is to inform the subject’s primary care physician of the 
subject’s participation in the clinical study.  If the subject does not have a primary care 
physician and the investigator will be acting in that capacity, the investigator is to 
document such in the subject’s medical record.   
The acquisition of informed consent and the subject’s agreement or refusal of his/her 
notification of the primary care physician  is to be documented in the subject’s medical 
records, and the informed consent form is to  be signed and personally dated by [CONTACT_21966] a legally acceptable representative and by [CONTACT_16994].  The original signed informed consent form is to be 
retained in accordance with institutional policy, and a copy of the signed consent form is 
to be provided to the subject or a legally acceptable representative. 
If a potential subject is illiterate or visually impaired and does not have a legally 
acceptable representative, the investigator must provide an impartial witness to read the 
informed consent form to the subject and must allow for questions.  Thereafter, both the 
subject and the witness must sign the informed consent form to attest that informed 
consent was freely given and understood.

Adverse Event Grading Scale 
The Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 is available 
at the following location:  
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm  
Drug-induced Liver Injury Reporting & Additional Assessments Reporting 
To facilitate appropriate monitoring for signals of Drug Induced Liver Injury (D ILI), cases 
of concurrent aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase  (ALT), 
alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and total bilirubin and/or international normalization ratio 
(INR) elevation according to the criteria specified in Secti on 6.4 require the following: 
 The event is to be reported to [COMPANY_010] as a serious adverse event within 24 hours of 
discovery or notification of the event (ie, before additional etiologic investigations 
have been concluded) 
 The appropriate case report form (CRF) (eg, Event CRF) that captures information 
necessary to facilitate the evaluation of treatment-emergent liver abnormalities is to 
be completed and sent to the [COMPANY_010].  
Other events of hepatotoxicity and potential DILI are to be reported as serious adverse 
events if they meet the criteria for a serious adverse event d efined in Section [IP_ADDRESS] . 
Additional Clinical Assessments and Observation 
All subjects in whom investigational product(s) is/are withheld (either permanently or 
conditionally) due to potential DILI as specified in Section 6.4.[ADDRESS_372474] or ALT elevations > 3 x upper limit of normal (ULN) are to undergo a 
period of “close observation” until abnormalities return to normal or to the subject’s 
baseline levels.  Assessments that are to be performed during this period include:  
 Repeat AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), bilirubin (total and direct), and INR 
within 24 hours  
 In cases of total bilirubin > 2x ULN or INR > 1.5, retesting of liver tests, bilirubin (total 
and direct), and INR is to be performed every [ADDRESS_372475]:  Talimogene Laherparepvec 
Protocol Number:  20140299  
Date:  [ADDRESS_372476](s) or protocol-required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_33218]/have been 
discontinued AND the subject is asymptomatic. 
 Initiate investigation of alternative causes for elevated AST or ALT and/or elevated 
total bilirubin: 
 Obtain complete blood count with differential to assess for eosinophilia 
 Obtain serum total immunoglobulin IgG, Anti-nuclear antibody, Anti Smooth 
Muscle Antibody, and Liver Kidney Microsomal antibody 1 to assess for 
autoimmune hepatitis 
 Obtain serum acetaminophen (paracetamol) levels 
 Obtain a more detailed history of:  
o Prior and/or concurrent diseases or illness 
o Exposure to environmental and/or industrial chemical agents  
o Symptoms (if applicable) including right upper quadrant pain, 
hypersensitivity-type reactions, fatigue, nausea, vomiting and fever 
o Prior and/or concurrent use of alcohol, recreational drugs and special diets 
o Concomitant use of medications (including non-prescription medicines and 
herbal and dietary supplements), plants, and mushrooms 
 Obtain Hepatitis A, B, C viral serologies and human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV) 
 Obtain creatinine phosphokinase (CPK), haptoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase

Response  
The Immune-related Response Criteria (irRC) simulating Response Evaluation Criteria 
in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1(irRC-RECIST) defined by [CONTACT_44939], 2014, with 
modification will be employed to account for unique tumor response characteristics 
observed with immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_304358], if the subject is 
clinically stable. 
Method of Measurement of Tumor Lesions 
Computed Tomography Scans (or Magnetic Resonance Imaging):  
Computed tomography (CT) scans by [CONTACT_22242]-enhanced or spi[INVESTIGATOR_44824] (or magnetic 
resonance imaging [MRI] scan) will be performed to evaluate tumor response for visceral 
or nodal/soft tissue disease (including lymph nodes).  Measurability of lesions on CT 
scan is based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_372484] or to MRI (or vice versa) should 
not pr eclude response assessment if, in the judgment of the site radiologist, there is no 
significant difference in the assessment by [CONTACT_44932].  This may occur if a 
subject has developed a medical contraindication to intravenous contrast for CT scans 
while on trial.  This change would require the preapproval of the [COMPANY_010] medical monitor. 
Positron Emission Tomography ( PET)/CT Scans:   
If a combined PET/CT scan is performed at the discretion of the investigator, the CT 
portion of that exam should not be substituted for the dedicated CT exams required by 
[CONTACT_3181].  The PET portion of the CT may introduce additional data which may bias 
the investigator assessment of response if it is not routinely or serially performed.  
However, if the investigator or the site radiologist can document that the CT performed 
as part of a PET/CT is of identical diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT (with intravenous 
and oral contrast) then the CT portion of the PET/CT can be used for tumor 
measurements.

Ultrasound:  
Ultrasound should not be used as a primary method to assess lesion measurements in 
response to treatment.  If new lesions are identified by [CONTACT_13192], confirmation by [CONTACT_304405]. 
Clinical Lesion Measurements 
Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial and 
>10 mm in diameter as assessed using calipers (eg, skin nodules).  For the case of skin 
lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_3606] a ruler to estimate the size of the 
lesion is suggested.  As noted above, when lesions can be evaluated by [CONTACT_304406], imaging evaluation should be undertaken.  
At baseline, lesions are categorized as measurable or non-measurable according to the 
following definitions: 
Measurability of Tumor Lesions  at Baseline 
Measurable Lesions 
Measurable lesions are defined at baseline as lesions that can be accurately measured 
in at least one dimension (ie, longest diameter for non-nodal lesions and short axis for 
lymph nodes will be measured and followed) with a minimum size of: 
 ≥ [ADDRESS_372485] scan (CT scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm) or MRI  
  10 mm caliper measurement by [CONTACT_304407]   
 A lymph node must be ≥ [ADDRESS_372486]’s overall disease (eg, largest 
lesions per organ).  
Non-Measurable Lesions: 
All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter < 10 mm or pathological 
lymph nodes with ≥ 10 mm but < 15 mm short axis) and other truly non-measurable 
lesions are considered non -measurable and characterized as non-target lesions.  This 
will include any measurable lesions beyond the maximum number of 10 total 
(maximum 5 per organ) at baseline and new measurable lesions that were not chosen 
as target lesions.  Only cancerous lesions should be selected as non -measurable

cutis/pulmonis), and groups of lesions that are small and numerous. 
Fluid Collections 
Ascites, pleural effusion, or pericardial effusion should not be selected as 
non-measurable disease at baseline or, if new or increased, as evidence of progressive 
disease (PD).  These collections may occur with both benign and malignant conditions, 
and their etiology is often not clear.  These collections may be removed via 
interventional procedures, which can lead to a false interpretation of disease response.  
These fluid collections should not be used as baseline non-target lesions or as evidence 
of disease response. 
Bone Lesions 
 Bone scans, PET scans or plain films are not considered adequate imaging 
techniques to measure bone lesions.  However, these techniques can be used to 
confirm the presence or absence of bone lesions. 
 Osteolytic (lytic) bone lesions or mixed lytic-blastic lesions, with identifiable soft 
tissue components, that can be evaluated by [CONTACT_12783]-sectional imaging technique 
such as CT or MRI can be considered as measurable lesions if the soft tissue 
component meets the definition of measurability as described above.  Only the 
soft tissue component of the bone lesion should be measured. 
 Many osteoblastic (blastic) bone abnormalities can be benign and should not be 
selected as baseline lesions.  An isolated new small blastic lesion should not be 
selected as a new lesion unless there is demonstrated growth on subsequent 
scans.  Multiple new blastic lesions that are clearly cancerous may be considered 
for new lesions. 
Cystic Lesions 
 Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not 
be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable or non-measurable) 
since they are, by [CONTACT_108], simple cysts. 
 Cystic lesions thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as 
measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above.  
However, if non-cystic lesions are present in the same subject, these are 
preferred for selection as target lesions.  If a cystic lesion is clearly cancerous 
and has both cystic and solid components, then the complete lesion should be 
measured including both components without excluding the cystic portion of a 
cystic tumor lesion when measuring.

Baseline Documentation of “Target” and “Non-Target” Lesions 
Baseline evaluations will be used to prospectively identify all sites of disease present as 
close as possible to the enrollment and never mor e than 4 weeks before the enrollment 
date.  Sites of disease will be characterized as either target or non -target lesions.  
Baseline Documentation of Target Lesions 
Up to 10 target lesions (a maximum of 5 per organ) will be chosen to measure over the 
course of therapy.  Pathological lymph nodes that are defined as measurable must meet 
the criterion of a short axis of ≥ [ADDRESS_372489]’s overall 
disease status.  Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with 
longest diameter) and suitability for accurate repeated measurements by [CONTACT_28171].  In situations where larger lesions cannot be accurately measured 
repeatedly (eg, near the diaphragm where respi[INVESTIGATOR_44825]), smaller lesions that meet criteria for measurability may be selected 
instead. 
A sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions)  for all 
target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum of diameters.   
Baseline Documentation of Non-Target Lesions  
All other lesions (or sites of disease), including any measurable lesions that were not 
chosen as target lesions and pathological lymph node with short axis ≥ 10 mm but 
< 15 mm, should be identified as non-target lesions.   Measurable non-target lesions 
(ie, lesions in an organ beyond the allowed maximum number of targets that would 
otherwise qualify as target lesions) should also be recorded and assessed qualitatively 
over the course of the study.  Non-measurable non-target disease measurements are 
not required, but these lesions are evaluated at each timepoint and will be evaluated as 
‘present’, ‘absent’, or in rare cases ‘unequivocal progression’.

Follow-up Assessment of Tumor Lesions 
At each subsequent tumor assessment, the sum of diameters of target lesions identified 
at baseline plus the sum of diameters of up to 10 (maximum 5 per organ) new 
measurable lesions (for which the longest diameter is ≥ 10 mm for non-nodal lesions or 
the short axis is ≥ 15 mm for nodal lesions) are added together to provide the total tumor 
burden.  If more than 10 new measurable lesions total (or 5 per organ) are present, the 
new measurable lesions should be selected on the basis of their size and suitability for 
accurate repeated measurements by [CONTACT_15218] (CT or MRI).  If there are 
lesions beyond the new measurable lesion limit during the course of the study for one 
subject, the additional lesions would be considered new non-measurable lesions. 
Tumor Burden = sum of diameter of target lesions + sum of diameter of up to 
10 (maximum 5 per organ) new, measurable lesions. 
Non-target disease measurements are not required and these lesions  should be 
followed as “present”, “absent”, or “unequivocal progression”. 
For non-nodal target lesions that become too small to measure, a value of 5 mm will be 
assigned.  If the non-nodal lesion subsequently increases in size to greater than or equal 
to 5 mm in one dimension, its true size will be recorded.  If an actual measurement is 
able to be provided, this should be recorded even if it is <[ADDRESS_372490] that the non -nodal lesion has likely disappeared, the measurement should 
be recorded as “0 mm ”.  Nodal disease should always have the actual short axis 
measurement recorded even if the nodes regress to below 10 mm on study.  
Response Evaluation 
Evaluation of Objective Response 
The subjec t response will be assessed bas ed on tumor burden (t he sum of diameters of 
target lesions plus th e sum of up to 10 [maximum 5 per organ] new measurable lesions ), 
and, in the case of complete response (CR), the presence of any non -target and/or new 
non-measurable lesions.  The overall response is derived from timepoint response 
assessments as described in Table 14-[ADDRESS_372491]:  Talimogene Laherparepvec

consecut ive assessment no less than [ADDRESS_372492] documented.  Any pathological lymph nodes (whether 
target or non -target) must have reduction in short axis to

Partial Response (PR):  Decrease in tumor burden* ≥ 30% relative to baseline 
confirmed by a consecutive assessment at least 4 weeks 
(28 days) after first documentation  
Progressive Disease (PD):  Increase in tumor burden* ≥ 20 % and at least 5 mm 
absolute increase relative to nadir (minimum recorded tumor 
burden) confirmation by a repeat, consecutive assessment 
no less than 4 weeks (28  days) from the date first

was unable to be evaluated leading to an inability to 
determine the status o f that particular tumor for that time

lesions identified at baseline) the response will be unevaluable. 
Determination of BOR is based on changes in total tumor burden from the baseline 
(nadir, for PD) tumor assessment, regardless of any initial increase in baseline lesions or 
the appearance of new lesions.  
Subjects are considered to have PR or SD even if new lesions were present, as long as 
they met the respective thresholds of response as described in Table 14-2. 
The best overall response for an unconfirmed CR or PR will be SD, and it will be UE if 
the last overall response is PD in the absence of consecutive confirmation or clinical 
deterioration.  A best overall response of SD requires a visit response of SD or better no 
earlier than 63 days  after the start of treatment ; otherwise the overall response will be 
UE.

Confirmation of Response (CR or PR) 
To be assigned a BOR of CR or PR, a corresponding overall visit response of CR or PR  
must be confirmed by [CONTACT_44935] 4 weeks 
(28 days) after the criteria for response are first met. 
In some circumstances it may be difficult to distinguish residual disease from normal 
tissue.  When the evaluation of CR depends on this determination, it is recommended 
that the residual lesion be investigated (i e, biopsy) to confirm the CR status. 
Confirmation of Disease Progression 
If a subject is classified as having PD at a post baseline tumor assessment, then 
confirmation of PD by a second assessment ≥ 4 weeks (28 days) later in the absence of 
rapid clinical deterioration (eg , rapid decline in performance status) or symptomatic 
disease requiring rapid initiation of alternative systemic anti-cancer therapy is required.  
The definition of confirmation of progression represents a ≥  20% and at least 5 mm 
absolute increase in the total tumor burden (ie, the sum of diameters of target lesions 
plus up to 10 [maximum 5 per organ] new measurable lesions) compared to the nadir at 
[ADDRESS_372497] 4 weeks (28 days) apart (with the date of progression 
considered to be the time of the initial evaluation showing PD) .   
Subjects with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of 
treatment without objective evidence of PD at the time should have the reason for 
treatment discontinuation specified.  Every effort should be made to document the 
objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment. 
Subjects who have had a procedure to completely/partially resect a lesion will be 
evaluated as follows: 
The procedure itself and all post -procedure lesion assessments should always be 
recorded in the CRF.  A completely resected lesion should be assigned a default code of 
0 mm (for target lesions) or “absent” (for non-target lesions).   A partially resected lesion 
should be assigned its measurement post-procedure (for target lesions) or “present” (for 
non-target lesions).  If the resected lesion contained no cancer under pathology 
evaluation, subsequent tumor assessments post-procedure may be used for tumor 
burden calculations and/or determination of response.  If the resected lesion contained 
cancer or pathology results were unknown, the recorded tumor assessments 
post-procedure may be used for tumor burden calculations, but determination of 
response will be considered unevaluable (UE) for response except in the case of PD.

or sensory dysfunction, and altered or depressed level of consciousness.  
Encephalopathy from metabolic or electrolyte imbalances needs to be distinguished from 
potential meningoencephalitis resulting from infection (bacterial, viral, or fungal) or 
progression of malignancy, or secondary to a paraneoplastic process.   
All patients being considered for meningoencephalitis should be urgently evaluated with

Immune-mediated Myositis 
Immune-mediated myositis has been associated with the administration of 
atezolizumab.  Myositis or inflammatory myopathies are a group of disorders 
sharing the common feature of inflammatory muscle injury; dermatomyositis and 
polymyositis are among the most common disorders.  Initial diagnosis is based 
on clinical (muscle weakness, muscle pain, skin rash in dermatomyositis), 
biochemical (serum creatine kinase increase), and imaging 
(electromyography/magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) features, and is confirmed 
with a muscle biopsy. 
Patients with signs and symptoms of myositis, in the absence of an identified 
alternate etiology, should be treated according to the guidelines in Table 14-16.

function, including serum creatinine, should be monitored throughout study 
treatment.  Patients with abnormal renal function should be evaluated and treated 
for other more common etiologies (including prerenal and postrenal causes, and 
concomitant medications such as non -steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs).  Refer 
the patient to a renal specialist if clinically indicated.  A renal biopsy may be 
required to enable a definitive diagnosis and appropriate treatment.  If no 
alternative cause of acute kidney injury is identified, patients with signs and 
symptoms of acute kidney injury, in the absence of an identified alternate 
etiology, should be treated according to the management guidelines in

CONFIDENTIALImmune -mediated Myositis
Immune -mediated myositis has been associated with the administration of 
atezolizumab.  Myositis or inflammatory myopathies are a group of disorders 
sharing the common feature of inflammatory muscle injury; dermatomyositis and 
polymyositis are among the most common disorders.  Initial diagnosis is based 
on clinical (muscle weakness, muscle pain, skin rash in dermatomyositis), 
biochemical (serum creatine kinase i ncrease), and imaging 
(electromyography/ magnetic resonance imaging [ MRI]) features, and is confirmed 
with a muscle biopsy .
Patients with signs and symptoms of myositis, in the absence of an identified 
alternate etiology, should be treated according to the guidelines in Table 14 -16.

aAtezolizumab may be withheld for a longer period of time (i.e., 12 weeks after event onset) to allow 
for corticosteroids (if initiated) to be reduced to the equivalent of 10mg/day oral prednisone.  The 
acceptable length of the extended period of time must be agreed upon by [CONTACT_40904].
bIf corticosteroids have been initiated, they must be tapered over 1 month to the equivalent of 
10mg/day oral prednisone before atezolizumab can be resumed.
cResumption of atezolizumab may be considered in patients who are deriving benefit and have fully 
recovered from the immune -mediated event.  Patients can be re -challenged with atezolizumab only 
after approval has been documented by [CONTACT_33494] (or an appropriate delegate) and the 
Medical Monitor.

1.1 Primary objectives
1.1.1 Perform a preliminary assessment of the efficacy of single-agent ibrutinib, 
based on overall response rate, in subjects with relapsed or refractory 
transformed indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (R/R TIL).
1.2 Secondary objectives
1.2.1 To determine the tolerability of chronic ibrutinib therapy in this patient 
population.
1.2.2 To determine the disease control rate of this regimen.
1.2.3 Evaluate the complete response rate, overall survival, and progression-free 
survival to single-agent ibrutinib in this patient population.
1.2.4 Determine response rate relative to the underlying B-cell histology.
2.0 BACKGROUND
2.1 Transformed indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma
Indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas are comprised of several histologic subtypes, 
including follicular lymphoma (FL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and marginal 
zone lymphoma (MZL). As a disease class, it is incurable short of allogeneic 
transplantation and shows a variable natural history. The course is typi[INVESTIGATOR_115213]. Most 
patients eventually relapse with a disease phenotype that is increasingly resistant to 
treatment, with shorter intervals of response, over time [1, 2]. At a rate of approximately 
3% per year, indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas transform into more aggressive 
malignancies that share a clonal relationship with the original disease [3]. 
Transformed indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (TIL) is classically diagnosed with 
histologic demonstration of an increased proportion, compared with the original specimen, 
of large neoplastic cells. Though typi[INVESTIGATOR_115214], other subtypes, 
including to unclassifiable B cell lymphoma (BCLU), lymphoblastic lymphoma, and acute 
lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) also occur [4]. Clinically, transformation is often reflected 
by a rapid rise in LDH, discordant localized nodal growth, or new B-type symptoms [4, 5]. 
Treatment paradigms for TIL are dictated by [CONTACT_115230][INVESTIGATOR_115215]. 
High dose therapy (HDT) followed by [CONTACT_115231] (ASCT) appears to benefit select patients, with estimates of 5-year overall 
survival ranging from 37 – 65% [6-9], but this procedure is generally limited to a subset of 
patients with chemotherapy-sensitive disease and in good physical condition. Involved-
field radiotherapy is beneficial in the subset of patients with early stage disease. For cases 
of relapsed or refractory TIL (R/R TIL), few therapeutic strategies of proven benefit are 
available. Radioimmunotherapy has activity in a subset of patients with R/R TIL and is 
approved for this indication; however its role is not yet clearly defined [10].

 Protocol 9107
Version 7.0  Dated 07/18/2022 Page 6 of 342.2 Ibrutinib in lymphoma 
The B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) transmits proliferation signals during normal B cell 
development and its signaling activity has been shown to play a role in a variety of B cell 
malignancies, including follicular lymphoma [11, 12]. The Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) 
is an essential component of the BCR pathway; its absence results in the arrest of normal 
peripheral B cell maturation and, consequently, low levels of circulating immunoglobulin 
[13, 14]. Ibrutinib (PCI-[ZIP_CODE]) is a small molecule that selectively and covalently inhibits 
BTK and has shown activity in several B cell malignancies, including previously treated 
mantle cell lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, for which its administration is 
FDA approved [15]. Early data also suggest a benefit in FL, with an overall response rate 
in 6 of 11 patients treated on PCYC-[ZIP_CODE], and in DLBCL [16]. Ibrutinib is not currently 
FDA approved for these diseases nor for RR/TIL. Ibrutinib has been shown to modulate 
B-cell chemotaxis and migration and promote apoptosis [17]. It is taken orally and, to date, 
has demonstrated a very good safety profile with reported adverse events mostly grade 1 
and 2 in severity and typi[INVESTIGATOR_115216]-limited in duration [15, 18].
2.3 Summary
R/R TIL presents a great therapeutic challenge and requires novel strategies. Ibrutinib has 
shown significant promise in treating several B-cell malignancies, and its oral 
administration and favorable toxicity profile make it an especially attractive candidate in 
advanced, previously treated disease. We hypothesize that its use will achieve significant 
and durable responses in a subset of patients with R/R TIL, thus adding to the limited 
selection of therapeutic options for this disease.
3.0 DRUG INFORMATION
  
3.1 General Information
Ibrutinib is an orally-administered, covalently-binding small molecule inhibitor of 
Bruton’s tyrosine kinase, currently being co-developed by [CONTACT_14190], Inc. and 
Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC in B-cell malignancies.

 Protocol 9107
Version 7.0  Dated 07/18/[ADDRESS_128689] common adverse reactions (≥20%) in patients with CLL were 
thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, bruising, neutropenia, anemia, upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_115217], fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, rash, pyrexia, constipation, peripheral 
edema, arthralgia, nausea, stomatitis, sinusitis, and dizziness. 
3.3.2 Hemorrhage
Five percent of patients with MCL and 6% of patients with CLL had Grade 3 or 
higher bleeding events (subdural hematoma, ecchymoses, gastrointestinal bleeding, 
and hematuria). Overall, 4 bleeding events including bruising of any grade occurred 
in 48% of patients with MCL treated with 560 mg daily and 63% of patients with 
CLL treated at [ADDRESS_128690] occurred in 5% of patients with MCL and 10% of patients 
with CLL who have been treated with ibrutinib. Four percent of patients with MCL, 
had skin cancers and 1% had other carcinomas. Eight percent of patients with CLL 
had skin cancers and 2% had other carcinomas.It is not clear whether or not these 
events are attributable to ibrutinib. 
3.[ADDRESS_128691] ibrutinib dose 
evaluated in clinical trials was 12.5 mg/kg (actual doses of 840 – 1400 mg) given 
for 28 days with single dose AUC values of 1445 ± 869 ng ⋅ hr/mL which is 
approximately 50% greater than steady state exposures seen at the highest indicated 
dose (560 mg). Avoid concomitant administration of ibrutinib with strong or 
moderate inhibitors of CYP3A. For strong CYP3A inhibitors used short-term (e.g., 
antifungals and antibiotics for 7 days or less, e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, 
voriconazole, posaconazole, clarithromycin, telithromycin) consider interrupting 
ibrutinib therapy during the duration of inhibitor use. Avoid strong CYP3A 
inhibitors that are needed chronically. If a moderate CYP3A inhibitor must be used, 
reduce the ibrutinib dose. Patients taking concomitant strong or moderate CYP3A4 
inhibitors should be monitored more closely for signs of ibrutinib toxicity. Avoid 
grapefruit and Seville oranges during ibrutinib treatment, as these contain moderate 
inhibitors of CYP3A.

plasma concentrations by [CONTACT_3450] 10-fold. Avoid concomitant use of strong 
CYP3A inducers (e.g., carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], rifampin, phenytoin and
St. John’s Wort). Consider alternative agents with less CYP3A induction. 
Appendix C outlines some of the inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A.
 
3.4.[ADDRESS_128692] been reports of hemorrhagic events in subjects treated with ibrutinib, 
both with and without thrombocytopenia. These include minor hemorrhagic events 
such as contusion, epi[INVESTIGATOR_115218]; and major hemorrhagic events including 
gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage, and hematuria. Also, patients 
with congenital bleeding diathesis have not been studied. Warfarin or vitamin K 
antagonists should not be administered concomitantly with ibrutinib. Supplements 
such as fish oil and vitamin E preparations should be avoided. Ibrutinib should be 
withheld at least [ADDRESS_128693]-surgery depending upon the type of 
surgery and the risk of bleeding (see Section 5.3). Ibrutinib should be used with 
caution in subjects requiring other anticoagulants or medications that inhibit 
platelet function. It is possible that treatment with ibrutinib may increase the risk of 
bruising or bleeding, particularly in subjects receiving antiplatelet agents or 
anticoagulants. Subjects receiving antiplatelet agents in conjunction with ibrutinib 
should be observed closely for any signs of bleeding and ibrutinib should be held 
in the event of major bleeding events defined as adverse event of special interest 
(Section 12). 
3.5 Lymphocytosis
MCL:
Upon initiation of ibrutinib a temporary increase in lymphocyte counts (ie >= 50% 
increase from baseline and above absolute lymphocyte count of 5,000/mcL) 
occurred in 33% of patients in the MCL study. The onset of isolated lymphocytosis 
occurs during the first few weeks of ibrutinib therapy and resolves by a median of 
8 weeks.
Patients with MCL who develop lymphocytosis greater than 400,000/mcL have 
developed intracranial hemorrhage, lethargy, gait instability, and headache. 
However, some of these cases were in the setting of disease progression.
CLL:
Upon initiation of ibrutinib a temporary increase in lymphocyte counts (ie >= 50% 
increase from baseline and above absolute lymphocyte count of 5,000/mcL) in 77% 
of patients in the CLL study. The onset of isolated lymphocytosis occurs during the 
first month of ibrutinib therapy and resolves by a median of 23 weeks (range 1 - 
104+ weeks).

Progression-free survival will be calculated using assessments by [CONTACT_431]. 
Kaplan-Meier methodology will be used to estimate event-free curves and 
corresponding quartiles (including the median).
10.6 Assessment inadequate, objective status unknown: Progression has not been 
documented and one or more target lesions or other sites of disease have not been 
assessed or inconsistent methods of assessment were used.
10.7 Bone Marrow Status: Bone marrow status is evaluated as follows: 
Positive: Unequivocal cytological or architectural evidence of malignancy.  
Negative: No aggregates or only a few well-circumscribed lymphoid 
aggregates.  
Indeterminate:  Does not qualify for either Positive or Negative Status.  *Note this

11.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
11.1 The primary objective is to gain a preliminary (pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]) assessment of the efficacy of 
this regimen based on overall response rate (ORR) (see section 10.2).  Analyses of 
secondary endpoints will be primarily descriptive. Patients with R/R TIL have a 
poor prognosis and short median survival; therefore an ORR of ≥ 30%, a disease 
control rate of ≥ 50% (defined as ORR plus stable disease, as defined in section 
10.2), or a median PFS of ≥  6 months will be considered a success.
11.2 Anticipated accrual: We anticipate that accrual will take 1-2 years.     
11.3 Estimated* distribution of study population by [CONTACT_115238]:
Ethnic Category Females Males
American Indian/Alaska Native
Asian 1 1
Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander
Black or African American 1 1
White 8 8
More than one race
Unknown or not reported
Racial Categories: Total of all subjects 10 10
*The exact sample size is not known since it is dependent on the number of 
evaluable patients, but we estimate the total enrollment will be 20.

12.0 STUDY MONITORING AND REPORTING PROCEDURES
12.1 Adverse Event Reporting 
Complete and timely reporting of adverse events (AEs) is required to ensure the 
safety of patients.  Reporting requirements are determined by [CONTACT_115239] (severity), the relationship to the study 
therapy (attribution), and the prior experience  (expectedness) of the adverse 
event, and whether the event is of interest  to Janssen Scientific Affairs.  The 
guidelines outlined in this section, as well as the specific direction on each report 
form must be followed.  The NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events v4.0 (CTCAE) will be used to classify and grade toxicities.
12.2 Definitions and descriptions of terms used in adverse event reporting.
12.2.1 Adverse Event (AE)
An adverse event is defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the 
use of a medical treatment or procedure.
12.2.2 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) or Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR)
A Serious Adverse Event or Adverse Drug Reaction means any AE/ADR 
occurring at any dose that results in:
Death;
A life-threatening AE/ADR (i.e, the patient/subject was, in the view of the 
initial reporter/investigator, at immediate risk of death from the AE as it 
occurred. It does not refer to an AE that hypothetically might have caused 
death if more severe);
Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] (i.e, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_115223]/ADR: excludes 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_115224] (e.g., social reasons such as pending 
placement in long-term care facility) OR surgery or procedure planned 
before entry into the study (must be documented in the CRF). Note: 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23743], and 
where the underlying condition for which the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_115225], will not be considered serious adverse events. Any 
adverse event that results in a prolongation of the originally planned 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23745] a new serious adverse event;

that there is a substantial disruption of a person's ability to conduct normal 
life functions;
A congenital anomaly/birth defect;
An important medical event (i.e., AEs/ADRs that might not be 
immediately life-threatening, or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_115226], based upon appropriate medical and scientific 
judgment, they might jeopardize the patient/subject or might require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other serious 
outcomes listed above);
Any suspected transmission via a medicinal product of an infectious agent.
Sponsor-Investigator shall use his/her judgment to determine the relationship 
between the Serious Adverse Drug Experience and the Study Drug.
Disease progression should not be recorded as an adverse event or serious adverse 
event term; instead, signs and symptoms of clinical sequelae resulting from disease 
progression/lack of efficacy will be reported if they fulfill the serious adverse event 
definition.
12.2.[ADDRESS_128718] safety monitoring activities. These events will be reported to Janssen 
Scientific Affairs within 24 hours of awareness irrespective of seriousness (ie, 
serious and nonserious adverse events) following the procedure described above 
for serious adverse events and will require enhanced data collection.  Specific 
adverse events of interest include:
1. Major Hemorrhage
Major hemorrhage is defined as any hemorrhagic event that is Grade 3 or greater 
in severity or that results in 1 of the following: intraocular bleeding causing loss 
of vision, the need for a transfusion of 2 or more units of red cells or an equivalent 
amount of whole blood, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].
2. Intracranial Hemorrhage
Any intracranial hemorrhage adverse event, including subdural 
hematoma/hemorrhage, epi[INVESTIGATOR_110116]/hemorrhage and intracerebral 
hemorrhage, of any grade severity, will be captured as an event of special interest.
3. Other Malignancies 
In addition to all routine AE reporting, all new malignant tumors, including solid 
tumors, skin malignancies and hematologic malignancies, are to be reported for

[CONTACT_1758]-site personnel within 24 hours of their knowledge of the event. 
Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (eg, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, and 
congenital anomaly) are considered serious adverse events and must be reported 
as a Serious Adverse Event. Any subject who becomes pregnant during the study 
must discontinue further study treatment. 
Because the effect of the study drug on sperm is unknown, pregnancies in partners 
of male subjects included in the study will be reported by [CONTACT_1758]-site personnel 
within [ADDRESS_128720] be used to determine the grade of the adverse event. If toxicity is not listed 
in the CTCAE use the following general criteria for grading.  
0 – No adverse event or within normal limits
1 – Mild adverse event
2 – Moderate adverse event
3 – Severe adverse event
4 – Life-threatening or disabling adverse event
5 – Fatal adverse event
12.2.6 Attribution
Attribution is defined as the determination of whether an adverse event is related 
to a medical treatment or procedure.  Attribution categories are as follows:
Unrelated The adverse event is clearly NOT related to therapy
Unlikely The adverse event is doubtfully related to therapy
Possible The adverse event may be related to therapy
Probable The adverse event is likely related to therapy
Definite The adverse event is clearly related to therapy
12.2.7 Unexpected Adverse Event
An adverse event is considered unlisted (unexpected) if the nature or severity is 
not consistent with the applicable product reference safety information. For 
ibrutinib, the expectedness of an adverse event will be determined by [CONTACT_115240]'s Brochure and US package insert.

Principal stages
The principal stage is determined by [CONTACT_115244]:
Stage I indicates that the cancer is located in a single region, usually one lymph node and the 
surrounding area. Stage I often will not have outward symptoms.
Stage II indicates that the cancer is located in two separate regions, an affected lymph node or 
organ and a second affected area, and that both affected areas are confined to one side of the 
diaphragm - that is, both are above the diaphragm, or both are below the diaphragm.
Stage III indicates that the cancer has spread to both sides of the diaphragm, including one organ 
or area near the lymph nodes or the spleen.
Stage IV indicates diffuse or disseminated involvement of one or more extralymphatic organs, 
including any involvement of the liver, bone marrow, or nodular involvement of the lungs.
These letters can be appended to some stages:
A or B: the absence of constitutional (B-type) symptoms is denoted by [CONTACT_115245] "A" to the 
stage; the presence is denoted by [CONTACT_1583] a "B" to the stage.
E: is used if the disease is "extranodal" (not in the lymph nodes) or has spread from lymph nodes 
to adjacent tissue.
X: is used if the largest deposit is >10 cm large ("bulky disease").
S: is used if the disease has spread to the spleen.

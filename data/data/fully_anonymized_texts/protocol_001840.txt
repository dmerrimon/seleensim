I. Background and Significance  
 
History of Ventilators  
 
A ventilator’s main purpose is to assist or replace the patient’s respi[INVESTIGATOR_362411] (1).  Ventilation started during the polio epi[INVESTIGATOR_362412]. 
Negati ve pressure ventilators such as the Iron Lung, were the most commonly used mechanical ventilators 
through out the 1950’s. After control of the Polio epi[INVESTIGATOR_901], invasive positive pressure ventilation via 
endotracheal tube or tracheostomy was predomina nt over non -invasive ventilation , largely because of its 
reliability and provision of direct access to the airway.  Invasive positive pressure ventilation means that 
positive pressure is applied to the patient’s airway through an endotracheal or tracheostomy t ube and 
causes gas to flow into the lungs until the ventilator breath is terminated.  As the airway pressure drops to 
zero, the elastic recoil of the chest pushes the tidal volume out, accomplishing passive exhalation (2).   
The major difference between in vasive and noninvasive ventilation is that with noninvasive ventilation, 
gas is delivered to the airway via a mask or “interface” rather than via an invasive conduit (endotracheal 
or tracheostomy tube) (3). With noninvasive ventilation, the positive pressu re to the patient is partially or 
fully provided by [CONTACT_362443].  
 
Noninvasive Ventilation  
 
Types of diseases that have been successfully treated with noninvasive ventilation include, but are not 
limited to, obstructive lung diseases (chronic obstructiv e pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, cystic 
fibrosis, upper airway obstruction), restrictive lung diseases (chest wall deformity, neuromuscular 
diseases, obesity hypoventilation), parenchymal lung disease (AIDS -related pneumonia, acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_362413] (ARDS), infectious pneumonia) and cardiogenic (acute pulmonary edema) (3). 
Patients with these types of diseases  may develop chronic derangement of daytime gas exchange  yielding  
daytime hypoxia and hypercapnia. Such patients are said to have chro nic respi[INVESTIGATOR_5448]. 
Patients with chronic respi[INVESTIGATOR_362414] , 
especially during sleep and such ineffective breathing disrupts nocturnal sleep and manifests as daytime 
sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008] (hyper somnia), early morning headache (due to hypercapnia), dyspnea, fatigue  and cognitive 
dysfunction .  Pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure can develop as well.  Correction of such 
ventilatory and gas exchange abnormalities using noninvasive positive  pressure ventilation  (NPPV)  is an 
increasingly popular method for improving sleep quality, heath -related quality of life, functional status  
(cognitive and physical) , and daytime gas exchange.   In addition, the use of nocturnal NPPV has been 
associated wit h an improvement in quality of life and overall survival in certain patient populations, such 
as Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).  
 
NPPV is often used for patients  prone to respi[INVESTIGATOR_362415]. As the 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_109458] w ork harder to meet the need for oxygen, they tire and become less efficient. That in

HRC -[ZIP_CODE] -HCPED -CC Version: 2.0, [ADDRESS_451558] to breathe in an already exhausted 
patient. The system is able to adequately support the ventilation and oxygen needs of patients  who are 
able to breathe spontaneously but whose efforts are unable to meet their total respi[INVESTIGATOR_362416].  
 
Invasive Ventilation  
 
Many of the disease states listed above for noninvasive ventilation are progressively declining disease 
states that may  ultimately  lead to the need for invasive ventilation.    Invasive  ventilation is indicated 
when the patient’s spontaneous ventilation and non -invasive ventilation are not adequate to sustain life.  
Some common indications for employing invasive  ventilation include, but are not limited to (2): 
• Apnea with respi[INVESTIGATOR_13374]  
• Acute lung injury  
• Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)  
• Chron ic restrictive pulmonary disease  
• Neuromuscular Disease  
 
Many of these disease states will require invasive  ventilation in the home.   Invasive  ventilators used in 
the home setting aid in augmenting or replacing spontaneous ventilatory efforts to achieve me dical 
stability in a non -acute setting. This capability allows the tracheotomized patient to return home and still 
receive adequate ventilatory support  (4). 
 
The goals of home invasive mechanical ventilation (via tracheostomy) are to sustain and extend lif e, to 
enhance the quality of life, to reduce morbidity, to improve or sustain physical and psychological function 
and to provide cost effective care (4). 
 
The device that will be used in this study is intended to supply the support that is needed for all p hases of 
the patient’s disease from noninvasive to invasive ventilation.  
 
Study Device   (Helix Ventilator)  
 
The Helix ventilator is a non -FDA cleared ventilator device. Helix  is the next generation Trilogy 
ventilator platform. The Helix ventilator has similar modalities to the Trilogy ventilator, which has FDA 
clearance.  The Helix device has improved algorithms, controls, and features to enhance the therapy 
delivery .  Additio nally , Helix has an updated hardware platform which has been adequately tested to 
ensure that the device specifications are met. No pre -clinical or developmental clinical work was required 
because of Trilogy being the established predicate.  
The Helix vent ilator provides invasive and non -invasive positive pressure ventilation for the care of 
patients ≥2.[ADDRESS_451559], and alarm SpO2, FiO2, CO2,

VIII. Risks and Discomforts  
The risks of providing ventilatory support with t he study device are no greater than the risks encountered with 
other ventilatory support devices.    
 
The device s that will be used by [CONTACT_362449]. Should the device not 
perform as designed, ventilation could increase and decrease more th an desired. This effect could be 
uncomfortable. Should any problems be identified, the respi[INVESTIGATOR_362434]’s current device.  
 
The Helix ventilator has similar modalities to  the Trilogy ventilator, which has FDA clearance. The key 
difference s between the Helix Ventilator ( study device ) and previously cleared Trilogy  devices are that 
the Helix  device has improved algorithms , controls , and features to enhance the therapy deliv ery. 
Additionally Helix has an updated hardware platform  which has been adequately tested to ensure that the 
device specifications are met . The improved algorithms and control s have been adequately tested to 
ensure that the delivery of therapy meets the device specifications.

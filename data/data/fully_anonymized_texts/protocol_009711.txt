IRB # [ZIP_CODE], Version 22   11/25/[ADDRESS_218890] Transplant Consortium (WCTC), City of Hope National Medical Center 
(COHNMC) has extensive experience with the use of Reduced Intensity Condi tioning (RIC) regimens.  
Fludarabine, 125 mg/m2 and Melphalan, 140 mg/m2 followed by [CONTACT_185432] (AHSCT) has been used effectively with limited toxicity in patients with hematologic 
malignancies.1, 30  However, relapse rem ains a significant cause of failure for patients with aggressive 
histologies.31 
Because of its relative safety and ability to target radiation directly to lymphoma cells, IDEC –2B8–MX–
DTPA [Ibritumomab Tiuxetan (Zevalin®)] will be combined with the RIC regi men of Fludarabine and 
Melphalan.  This preparative regimen will be used in selected patients with relapsed or refractory Low–
Grade Lymphoma (LGL) , Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) and Intermediate –Grade Non –Hodgkin 
Lymphoma (IG NHL).  The goal of this protocol is to use Zevalin® to increase the anti –lymphoma effect in 
these B –Cell lymphomas while at the same time preserving the adoptive immunotherapeutic Graft –
Versus –Lymphoma (GVL) effect and low Transplant –Related Mortality (TRM) associated with our current 
RIC regimen. 
This study will be a Phase II trial of 46 patients focusing on TRM, Relapse –Free Survival (RFS), Overall 
Survival (OS) and toxicity. Early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_185414].  However, there 
will be no early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_185415].  For details on stages of accrual and sample size 
requirements, please refer to § 14.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS . 
2.0 OBJECTIVES 
2.1 To evaluate the safety and efficacy of a preparative regimen of Yttrium –90 (90Y)–
Labeled Anti –CD20 Monoclonal A ntibody (MAb) in combination with Fludarabine and 
Melphalan followed by [CONTACT_185433] (APBSCT) for 
treatment of patients with B –Cell Low –Grade Non–Hodgkin Lymphoma ( LG NHL), 
Intermediate –Grade Non –Hodgkin Lymphoma (IG NHL)  and Mantle Cell Lymphoma 
(MCL). 
2.2 To evaluate the short – and long –term complications of this new preparative regimen, 
including rates of engraftment, Acute and Chronic Graft –Versus –Host–Disease 
(GVHD) and infectious complications.  
2.3 To estimate the dise ase response rate, disease relapse (progression) rate, and non -
relapse mortality rate.  
2.4 To perform exploratory studies that seek to measure/characterize the expression of 
costimulatory molecules and impact of these molecules on the NK and T cells of a 
subset of lymphoma patients pre - post- ASCT and the stem cell product from a 
portion of sibling donors.  
3.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 
3.1. INTRODUCTION 
Non–Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) is the fifth most common cancer in the [LOCATION_002].  According to 
the America n Cancer Society (ACS), approximately 58,870 people in the [LOCATION_002] will be 
diagnosed with Hodgkin Disease (HD) or NHL, and an estimated 18,[ADDRESS_218891] types of 
indolent and aggressive lymphomas increases with age.  It is estimated that a person‟s risk of 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_185416] [ADDRESS_218892] a 1 in 55 risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_185417].  Whites are affected more often than African Americans or Asian Americans.  Between 1973 
and 1996 the incidence of NHL increased by 80% in the [LOCATION_002].2 
5 
IRB # [ZIP_CODE], Version 22   11/25/13 Based on unique clinicopathologic features defined in the Revised European American Classification 
of Lymphoid Malignancies (REAL) and World Health Organization (WHO) classification system , 
Diffuse Large –Cell Lymphoma (DLCL), Follicular Lymphoma (FL) and MCL are diagnosed in 
approximately 31%, 22%, and 6%, respectively, of all new adult lymphoma diagnoses.3  
Approximately 30 –40% of patients with DLCL can be cured with conventional chemother apy,4 
whereas MCL and LGL are incurable with similar therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].5 
High–Dose Therapy (HDT) with autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (aHSCT) can 
rescue patients with DLCL who fail to achieve a remission or relapse after initial therapy, but 
treatment failure occurs in the majority of these patients, with Long –Term Survival (LTS) seen in 
approximately 30 –40% of these patients.6, [ADDRESS_218893] may be the result of tumor contamination of the re –infused Stem Cells (SCs) or 
intrinsic resistance of malignant cells to HDT.  Moreover, many patients fail to collect adequate 
numbers of SCs due to Bone Marrow (BM) involvement with lymphoma or extensive prior 
chemoradiotherapy.  Patients who relaps e after conventional therapy and cannot undergo aHSCT, or 
those relapsing after this procedure usually have short median survivals.  
Allogeneic donors can provide an alternative source of healthy Hematopoietic Stem Cells (HSCs) for 
these patients, with the added benefit of a potential GVL effect.  The GVL effect in lymphoma has 
been demonstrated by [CONTACT_185434] (DLIs) after relapse from all 
AHSCTs 9, 10, [ADDRESS_218894], resulting from Regimen –Related Toxicity (RRT) and 
GVHD.  To try to improve these results, RIC regimens have been successfully developed, allowing 
adequate engraftment in most cases and decreasing the RRT considerably.  These regimen s rely 
predominantly on the GVL effect for their success.  As expected, patients with malignancies that are 
more vulnerable to this effect, such as LGLs and Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL), have 
benefited more from this approach.20  Conversely, decreasi ng the power of the regimen may 
compromise disease control for patients with High(er) –Grade Lymphomas (HGLs) and other 
aggressive hematological malignancies.  This issue cannot be overstated given the observation that 
relapse contributes significantly to t reatment failure and that chemosensitivity consistently appears 
predictive of outcome following AHSCTs for NHL and Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML).9, 21, 22, 30   
The study will also focus on costimulatory receptors, namely, PD -1, CTLA-4, CD28, ICOS, OX40  and 
4-1BB (CD137), and will be performed on blood samples collected at various time points before and 
after the AHSCT regimen, using either FACS analysis or mRNA Q -PCR.  The results may contribute 
to a better understanding of immune factors important in o utcome.  To date, we have shown that the 
PD-[ADDRESS_218895], without significantly increasing RRT.  
3.2 ALLOGENEIC HEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELL TRANSPLANT (AHSCT) FOR NON–HODGKIN LYMPHOMA 
(NHL) 
The use of AHSCT in the treatment of NHL is increasing.  Although there are no large prospective 
randomized trials comparing the outcome of aHSCT versus AHSCT in NHL, most retrospec tive 
comparisons suggest that there is a lower risk of relapse following AHSCT, particularly in patients 
with LGL.  Unfortunately, AHSCT is also associated with a higher rate of early and late TRM, which 
tends to offset any potential advantage conferred by  [CONTACT_185435].  
6 
IRB # [ZIP_CODE], Version 22   11/25/13 We recently evaluated the long –term results in [ADDRESS_218896] at COHNMC between 1/91 and 5/99.[ADDRESS_218897] had adequate follow –up to 
determine LTS and risk of relapse .  In this study the median age was 40.7 years (range 18 –54).  
Fifteen patients (27%) had LGL, 16 patients (29%) had Intermediate –Grade Lymphoma (IGL), 8 
patients (15%) had MCL and 16 patients (29%) had HGL.  In this series, 93% of patients had 
advanced disease including relapse, PR after initial treatment or Progressive Disease (PD) during 
induction or multiple relapses.  The majority of patients received a Fractionated Total Body Irradiation 
(FTBI) containing regimen.  At the time of this analysis, 29 patients (53%) were alive.  Overall, the 
TRM was 29% and the relapse rate was 20%.  The Kaplan –Meier estimates for the 2 year OS and 
RFS rates for the entire group were 46% and 42% (see FIGURE 1A and FIGURE 1B).  The 2 year OS 
probability by [CONTACT_185436] e: LGL 83%, IGL 33%, HGL 0%, and MCL 56%, with a 
statistically significant difference seen between LGL and HGL patients based on the log –rank test 
(p=0.0110)  (see FIGURE 2). 
These results suggest that AHSCT is an effective therapeutic strategy in selected  patients with poor 
risk or refractory lymphoma.  Compared to aHSCT, the relatively lower risk of relapse observed in this 
study is in agreement with other reported trials, which suggest that AHSCT introduces a GVL effect.24, 
25, 26  Although the median ag e of patients with LGL and MCL is about 60 years, the median age of 
patients in our study was 40–41 years because, as commonly is the case, older patients were 
excluded because of concerns over the higher TRM and mortality associated with conventional Tota l 
Body Irradiation (TBI) based allografting in older patients.  Thus, the use of non –myeloablative or RIC 
regimens and AHSCT as part of a clinical trial should be explored for an older, less robust patient 
population and for those patients who would not be  candidates to receive an aHSCT.  
Recent studies conducted in the WCTC involving primarily the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center 
(FHCC), COHNMC and Stanford University have explored the use of a potentially less toxic approach 
to allografting for older patients  (≥ 50 years) with LG NHL, AML and multiple myeloma – diseases not 
readily cured by [CONTACT_185437].27, 28  These studies are based on the use of potent immunosuppression 
using Fludarabine, low dose TBI, Cyclosporine A ( CSA) and Mycophenolate Mofetil  (MMF) to limit the 
risk of graft rejection and GVHD and thereby [CONTACT_185438] a preclinical 
canine model.  Updates of these trials have evaluated the efficacy of establishing mixed or full donor 
hematopoietic chimerism using a non –myeloablative and relatively non –toxic conditioning regimen for 
allogeneic engraftment and to obtain preliminary data on GVL or Graft –Versus –Tumor (GVT) effects 
in a variety of tumor types and clinical situations (remissions, relapse).  The results from treatm ent of 
lymphoma with this approach for 74 patients (29 DLCL, 16 MCL and 29 LGL) show a Progression –
Free Survival (PFS) of 48% at 1 year for the whole group.  When analyzed by [CONTACT_27183], the more 
aggressive form of the disease showed a PFS of 35% with a rel apse rate of 33% while those patients 
with LGL showed a RFS of 60% and relapse of 16% with a median follow –up of a little > 1 year.29 
Based on the idea that some component of anti –tumor activity, in addition to the anti –tumor 
allogeneic response would be n ecessary for patients with this disease to improve the overall 
outcome, without increasing the toxicity, at COHNMC we conducted a parallel study to those active in 
the consortium with a regimen of Fludarabine and Melphalan (140 mg/m2).  In this Phase I/II Trial of 
40 patients, all patients received  Human Leukocyte Antigen  (HLA) matched related or unrelated

all patients, 67% for LGL and 48% for DLCL.  Similar  to the more RIC approach of our studies with 
Seattle, relapse was more common in those patients with advanced DLCL.[ADDRESS_218903] regimen,32 
33 we hypothesize that we can augment the anti –tumor efficacy of the allogeneic RIC regimen by [CONTACT_185439]20 antigen on B –Cell lymphoma, without an increase in 
RRT for patients with advanced lymphoma who would not be good candidates to benefit from the 
autologous approac h (BM/blood involvement, multiple relapsed LGL, MCL).  
3.3 MANTLE CELL LYMPHOMA (MCL) 
3.3.1 AUTOLOGOUS HEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELL TRANSPLANT (AHSCT)  FOR MANTLE CELL LYMPHOMA 
(MCL) 
MCL is associated with a poor prognosis and median OS of [ADDRESS_218904] 
chemotherapy.  Advanced stage disease, including BM and Peripheral Blood (PB) involvement, is 
commonly seen at diagnosis.  Response to conventional treatment approaches such as CHOP 
chemotherapy tends to be poor and PD is usually seen within 12 –18 months.1 
A recent update of the combined COHNMC/Stanford experience with [ADDRESS_218905] showed a higher OS and Event –Free Survival  (EFS) rate for patients undergoing 
transplantation in first remission  (CR1) (n=16) compared to patients  beyond CR1 (n=29).34  In this 
analysis, the median follow –up was 2.6 months.  The OS and EFS were 94% and 87% for CR1 
patients compared to 61% and 38%, respectively, for patients beyond CR1.  Relapse rate was lower 
(8% vs 56%) in CR1 patients.  
Other studi es have yielded conflicting results from aHSCT for MCL.  Some show inferior outcome 
compared with historical controls,[ADDRESS_218906] in the treatment of MCL 
due to lack of controlled studies; patients in CR1 appear to benefit most.  The routine use of this 
procedure cannot be ro utinely recommended outside of clinical protocols.  
3.3.2 ALLOGENEIC HEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELL TRANSPLANT (AHSCT)  FOR MANTLE CELL LYMPHOMA 
(MCL):   CONVENTIONAL MYELOABLATIVE REGIMENS 
The literature is limited for allogeneic HSCT for MCL.  Few studies have exa mined conventional dose 
conditioning regimens for this histology; in heavily pre –treated patients, EFS and OS at 2 –3 years 
were around 50% –60%, in registry and single institution studies.18, 43  This is in agreement with our 
experience with conventional my eloablative regimens in 10 patients with MCL with a 5 year 
probability of OS and PFS of 40 –50%.23, 30 
3.3.3 ALLOGENEIC HEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELL TRANSPLANT (AHSCT)  FOR MANTLE CELL LYMPHOMA 
(MCL):   REDUCED INTENSITY CONDITIONING (RIC) REGIMENS 
An appealing st rategy for MCL is the use of RIC regimens, given that most patients are older and 
experience excessive toxicity from conventional myeloablative regimens. Conflicting results have 
been reported in this setting.

of 13 months, 2 patients are alive without evidence of PD; [ADDRESS_218909] relapsed and died of PD 
and 1 died of acute GVHD without evidence of disease.30 
The WCTC has transplanted 16 patients with MCL using a non –myeloablative regimen of Fludarabine 
and single dose TBI, with CSA and MMF as GVHD prophylaxis.  Nine patients are alive in remission 
at 8–[ADDRESS_218910].29 
A single institution study of 18 patients with advanced/relapsed MCL conditioned with Fludarabine, 
Cyclophosphamide (Cy) and Rituxan® or Cisplatin, Fludarabine and Cytarabine followed by [CONTACT_185440], with Tacrolimus and Methotrexate for GVHD prophylaxis, was performed 
at MD Anders on.21  Patients were heavily pre –treated with a median of [ADDRESS_218911].  All patients engrafted and none experienced > grade [ADDRESS_218912] –transplant.  One of these 
patients achieved a CR after DLI.  At a median 26 month follow up, the current EFS was 82%.  
In contrast to MD Anderson and WCTC studies, a retrospective analysis from the European Bone 
Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) Lymphoma Registry repo rted poor outcomes in this setting.9  
Twenty –two heavily pre –treated patients with advanced MCL, 36% of who had failed previous 
aHSCT, were conditioned with a Fludarabine based regimen in 84% and BEAM in 10% of patients.  
Sixteen patients had chemosensitiv e disease at the time of transplant.  The 2 year PFS, OS and TRM 
were of 0%, 13%, and 82%, respectively.  The TRM in this series is higher than most studies with RIC 
regimens. 
Overall, the experience with AHSCT for MCL is limited.  Relapse remains a signif icant cause of 
treatment failure, and may be more common after RIC regimens than with conventional myeloablative 
regimens.  This issue, coupled with the anecdotal evidence of a GVL effect in MCL, the exquisite 
radiosensitivity of MCL and the generally olde r age of these patients, provides the rationale for 
enhancing the efficacy of RIC regimens with radioimmunoconjugates prior to AHSCT.  
3.4 DIFFUSE LARGE –CELL B–CELL NON–HODGKIN LYMPHOMA (B–DLCL NHL) 
3.4.1 AUTOLOGOUS HEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELL TRANSPLANT (AHSCT) FOR DIFFUSE LARGE –CELL B–
CELL NON–HODGKIN LYMPHOMA (B–DLCL NHL) 
The role of aHSCT for DLCL in chemosensitive relapse has been well established in a randomized 
study, with 46% of patients in the transplant arm enjoying durable remissions compared to 12% o f 
patients salvaged with chemotherapy alone.[ADDRESS_218913] in high risk DLCL patients in CR1, though 
this is not widely accepted.  More controversy exists regarding the role of this procedure for patients 
with chemorefractory disease, with few patients achieving long –term remissions.44 
3.4.2 ALLOGENEIC HEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELL TRANSPLANT (AHSCT)  FOR DIFFUSE LARGE –CELL 
LYMPHOMA (DLCL):   CONVENTIONAL MYELOABLATIVE REGIMENS 
A multicenter study from [LOCATION_009] reported 5 year OS and DFS of 41% and 40% in 73 patients with 
aggressive lymphomas, excluding Burkitt‟s and lymphoblastic lymphoma.45  Similarly, a registry 
analysis from the EBMT including 147 patients with IG NHL found a 4 year PFS and OS of 35% and 
38%, respectively; in this study, Chronic GVHD was associated with a lower ri sk of relapse.13  Our 
results in 16 patients with IGL in this setting showed an actuarial 2 year OS and PFS of 50%, with a 
low relapse rate of 10%. 23, 30

LYMPHOMA (DLCL):   REDUCED INTENSITY CONDITIONING (RIC) REGIMENS 
Low numbers of patients with DLCL treated with RIC regimens have been reported, with PFS rates of 
20–55%.  A registry analysis from the EBMT showed high rates of relapse for a heterogeneous group 
of HG NHL, in cluding several with DLCL, with 1 year PFS of 32%.  
Similarly, our experience at COHNMC with Fludarabine and Melphalan in 12 patients with B –DLCL 
undergoing sibling (7) or unrelated donor (5) transplantation shows a low 2 year OS and PFS of 36% 
and 17% with  a high relapse rate of 76%.30 
The WCTC transplanted 18 patients with DLCL with the non –myeloablative regimen of Fludarabine 
and TBI.  Eight patients are alive in remission, [ADDRESS_218914] 
died of non –relapse causes.[ADDRESS_218915] a higher relapse rate with RIC than with conventional 
regimens, and would provide the rationale for augmenting the preparative regimen with targeted 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. 
3.5 LOW–GRADE NON–HODGKIN LYMPHOMA (LG NHL) 
3.5.1 AUTOLOGOUS HEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELL TRANSPLANT (AHSCT)  FOR LOW–GRADE LYMPHOMA 
(LGL) 
Current treatment approaches are generally not curative in patients with advanced stage LG NHL 
although many in this patient population have indolent clinical courses.  Standa rd treatments often 
produce high Response Rates (RRs), but CR1 duration ranges from 12 –[ADDRESS_218916] from 1991 –1995 at COHNMC.53  Although prolonged OS (see FIGURE 3A) and PFS can 
be seen after aHSCT (see FIGURE 3B), long –term follow –up demonstrates a continuous risk of 
relapse.  Interventions aimed at decreasing the risk of relapse (ie, Rituximab for post–transplant 
consolidation and/or in vivo purging) are being investigated in this setting.  
10 
IRB # [ZIP_CODE], Version 22   11/25/[ADDRESS_218917] that the use of a FTBI containing preparative 
regimen is associated with a higher OS and PFS rate, perhaps reflectin g the exquisite sensitivity of 
LGLs to radiation therapy.  This observation supports the exploration of using intensified target doses 
of radiation such as radiolabeled antibodies in the conditioning regimen to maximize the anti –
lymphoma effect of the tran splant.  However, because of the long natural history and continued 
pattern of relapse after aHSCT (see FIGURE 3B), the curative potential of autografting in patients with 
relapsed LGL has not been established.  Moreover, an increased risk of Myelodysplasi a Syndrome 
(MDS) is observed in this patient population, indicating a need for close monitoring and reporting 
long–term follow –up of studies in this area.[ADDRESS_218918] strategies, as 
discussed below.  
3.5.2 ALLOGENEIC HEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELL TRANSPLANT (AHSCT)  FOR LOW–GRADE NON–
HODGKIN LYMPHOMA (LG NHL) 
Outcomes for LGLs after AHSCT are generally better than for more aggressive NHL, with PFS and 
EFS rates of 50% –80% and low relapse rates of 10 –20%,56, 57 suggesting an important role for GVL in 
curing these malignancies.  As such, RIC regimens are particularly appealing in this setting.  A recent 
report from MD Anderson showed a 2 year DFS of 84%, with a TRM of 5% and no relapses in 18 
patients with chemosensitive FL (n=18), and CLL/Small Lymphocytic Lympho ma (SLL) (n=2), 
conditioned Fludarabine, Cy, with or without Rituximab.20  The EBMT reported a 2 year PFS, PD and 
TRM of 54%, 21% and 31%, respectively, in 52 patients with LG NHL receiving a RIC regimen.9 
Similarly, the outcome for 34 patients with B –Cell LG NHL transplanted at COHNMC with 
conventional dose regimens (n=18) and a RIC regimen of Fludarabine and Melphalan (n=16) was 
similar in terms of relapse rates (15% versus 17%), with 2 year OS/PFS rates of 56%/50% and 
74%/61%, (p –values of 0.45 and 0.78) , suggesting that RIC regimens provide similar disease control 
to conventional dose regimens, with less TRM.  
3.6 RADIOIMMUNOTHERAPY (RIT) FOR B–CELL NON–HODGKIN LYMPHOMA (NHL) 
Recently, Radioimmunotherapy (RIT) has emerged as a promising treatment for NHL.   Radioisotope 
labeled MAbs provide a mechanism for targeting radiation preferentially to tumor sites, while sparing 
normal tissues.  B –Cell lymphomas are an attractive target for RIT because of their radiosensitivity, 
their well defined surface antigens, and the availability of multiple MAbs to those antigens.

IRB # [ZIP_CODE], Version 22   11/25/13 Iodine –131 (131I) has been the gold standard for RIT due to its long track record in treating thyroid 
cancer, its well –defined radiochemistry, its clinical availability, and its potential for both 
Radioimmunoimaging (RII) and RIT.  However, there are disadvantages of 131I, including its long 8 –
day half life, the risks of radiation exposure to health care providers and the non –specific irradiation to 
normal organs from the gamma (γ) components of 131I. 
Recent RIT trials for lymphoma have utilized 131I labeled anti –B1 (anti –CD20) antibody, with results 
suggesting that 131I labeled anti –B1 is safe and effective and may induce prolonged CR in heavily 
pre–treated LG and transformed LG NHL.58-60  Although ad ditional studies are needed, 131I anti –B1 
antibody can be safely given in combination with HD chemotherapy in an aHSCT setting for NHL.60 
Yttrium –90 (90Y) may be an ideal radionuclide for RIT since it emits beta (
 ) particles that are more 
potent than thos e delivered by 131I.  It is a pure 
  emitter, making it a safer reagent for medical 
personnel to administer than 131I.  In addition, the short half –life also facilitates the use of 90Y in 
combination with other agents, ( ie, chemotherapy) and allows for hig h dose rates at localized sites.  
Unfortunately, 90Y cannot be used for RII due to its absence of 
  emissions.  Indium –111 (111In) has 
been substituted as an imaging reagent to show tumor localization in patients scheduled for 90Y 
therapy, on the assumptio n that its biodistribution closely mimics that of 90Y. 
3.6.1 SINGLE –AGENT ZEVALIN® FOR RELAPSED LOW–GRADE NON–HODGKIN LYMPHOMA (LG NHL) 
The efficacy of the Zevalin® regimen was evaluated in 2 multicenter studies61, 62 enrolling a total of 
197 subjects:  
STUDY 1 was a single arm study of 54 patients with relapsed FL refractory to Rituxan® treatment.  
Patients were considered refractory if their last prior treatment with Rituxan® did not result in a CR or 
Partial Response (PR), or if Time –to–[Disease] Progress ion (TTP) was < 6 months.61  The primary 
efficacy endpoint of the study was the Overall Response Rate (ORR).  Secondary efficacy endpoints 
included TTP and Duration of Response (DR).  In a secondary analysis comparing objective 
response to the Zevalin® regimen with that observed with the most recent treatment with Rituxan®, 
the median DR following the Zevalin® regimen was [ADDRESS_218920] udy comparing the Zevalin® regimen to 
treatment with Rituxan®.62  The trial was conducted in 143 patients with relapsed or refractory LG or 
follicular NHL, or transformed B –Cell NHL.  A total of 73 patients received the Zevalin® regimen, and 
70 patients re ceived Rituxan® given as an intravenous (iv) infusion at 375 mg/m2 weekly x 4 doses.  
The primary efficacy endpoint of the study was to determine the ORR.  The ORR was significantly 
higher (80% vs 56%, p=0.002) for patients treated with the Zevalin® regimen.  The secondary 
endpoints, DR and TTP, were not significantly different between the 2 treatment groups on this study.

Adverse Events (AEs) observed in previous trials of the Zevalin® regimen were primarily hematologic, 
transient, and reversible.  Grade 4 neutropenia, throm bocytopenia, and anemia occurred in 32%, 
8.5%, and 4.3% of patients, respectively.  Hematologic levels recovered in all patients, except when 
patients went on to other therapy or had pre –existing cytopenias.  The severity of hematologic toxicity 
was related to baseline platelet count and percent BM involvement.  
The most frequent, non –hematologic AEs (asthenia, chills, fever, nausea, and headache) were 
related to accompanying Rituxan® infusions.  No major acute organ dysfunction was seen.  B –Cell 
depletion recovered 6 –9 months after therapy.  Median serum immunoglobulins remained within the 
normal range and were relatively stable throughout the treatment period and follow –up.  The 
formation of Human Anti –Murine Antibodies (HAMA) or Human Anti –Chimeric Antibod ies (HACA) 
occurred after the Zevalin® regimen in < 2% of patients.  T –cells were not depleted.  The incidence of 
severe infection was low (7.6% of patients hospi[INVESTIGATOR_185418]).  No observable 
age–dependent differences were seen in th e safety profile.  Rare cases of MDS observed were within 
the expected rate for this heavily pretreated patient population.  
3.6.2 SINGLE –AGENT ZEVALIN® FOR MANTLE CELL LYMPHOMA (MCL) 
Experience with Zevalin® as single agent for MCL is limited.  Younes repo rted 9 heavily pre –treated 
patients, 6 of whom were chemorefractory to their previous regimen.  The ORR was 33%, with [ADDRESS_218922] common toxicity being hematological.63 
3.6.3 ZEVALIN® AS PART OF AUTOLOGOUS HEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELL TRANSPLA NT (AHSCT) 
Use of high –dose RIT with Zevalin® plus high –dose chemotherapy followed by [CONTACT_185441].32, 33, 64  Preliminary 
observations indicate that Zevalin® can be combined wit h high –dose chemotherapy followed by 
[CONTACT_185442]. 
Investigators in Seattle have assessed biodistribution toxicities and efficacy of 131I anti –CD20 antibody 
in patients with B–Cell lymphoma undergoing aHSCT.  Patients were assessed with a test dose and 
those study subjects determined to have tumor doses > liver, lungs and kidney, were eligible for 
therapeutic infusion of 131I labeled antibody in this Phase I /II transplant trial.  Of 43 patients, 24 achieved 
favorable biodistributions and 19 subsequently received t herapeutic infusions of approximately 232 –777 
mCi of 131I labeled antibody at a dose of 58 –1168 mg.  This was followed by [CONTACT_185443] –infusion.  
13 
IRB # [ZIP_CODE], Version 22   11/25/13 Sixteen patients achieved a CR, 2 patients PR and 1 a minor response.  In their series 9 patients 
remain in continuous CR (PFS) between 3 –53 months.  This study indicates a 95% RR in patients able 
to demonstrate favorable biodistribution, with manageable toxicity, particularly with provision for 
autologous BM support.  
Further studies from this group sought to determine the MTD of 131I anti –CD20 antibody that could be 
combined with Etoposide (VP –16) and Cy.  Fifty –two patients with relapsed lymphoma were studied 
who received a therapeutic dose of 1.3 mg/kg protein labeled with iodine calculated to deliver a 
targeted dose of radiation (20 –27 Gy) to critical organs.  In this, the DFS after 2 years was 68%.  
Investigators in Nebraska have also combined 131I anti –CD20 antibody to a regimen of high –dose 
chemotherapy (BEAM) with encouraging results in patients with rel apsed lymphoma.  
An analysis of these studies suggest that the burden of tumor, the dose of antibody administered, the 
presence of circulating antigen, and the rate of antigen modulation may influence the biodistribution of 
radiolabeled antibodies and the e fficacy of RIT.  Similar to problems with immunotoxin therapy, larger 
tumor masses present formidable penetration barriers to antibodies because of the inefficiency of 
diffusion that exists in bulkier disease.  This latter problem may be addressed by [CONTACT_185444] (MeV) and path length may be more favorable for treating bulky 
disease.  It is for this and the results we have obtained in this program and other reasons 
summarized below that we have focused on the use of 90Y labeled antibodies in the treatment of 
patients with B –Cell lymphoma who are candidates for aHSCT.  
Patients with B –Cell lymphoma (LGL, MCL, DLCL) expressing the CD20 antigen on the cell surface 
are the target for this approach with particular emphasis on developi[INVESTIGATOR_185419].  Our studies indicate that the disease is sensitive to radiolabeled therapy and 
in the high –dose setting some patients can achieve long –term control of the disease.  For patients 
with advanced lymphoma, we utilized a dosimetry –based high –dose 90Y anti –CD20 immunoconjugate 
combined with high –dose VP –16 60 mg/kg and Cy (100 mg/kg), the 2 year DFS was 81% wi th a 
relapse rate 15% without an increase in transplant toxicity or compromise of engraftment.  For those 
older patients with lymphoma, a 90Y anti –CD20 antibody was added at a high –dose regimen of 
BEAM.  With a median age of 61 (40 –81) [ADDRESS_218923] rec eived treatment.  Currently, 70% of the 
patients are alive and PFS is with a median follow –up of 12 months.  We had hypothesized that a 
major contributing cause of relapse following autologous Bone Marrow Transplant (aBMT) is the 
residual sites of disease,  and that 90Y labeled CD20 specific MAb may be utilized to increase the 
targeted efficacy of the preparatory regimen used for patients undergoing transplantation for B –Cell 
lymphoma.  The short half life of this heavy metal also leads to an increased dose rate at tumor sites, 
which can enhance the therapeutic killing effect.  Of additional importance, the high emission (2.3 
MeV max) allows for more effective crossfire from targeted cells to cells that have not been bound by 
[CONTACT_30936], either for antigenic re asons or for tumor bulk.  The average path length is [ADDRESS_218924] 
to iodine which is 0.8 mm (59).  Localization of any released 90Y to bone will also increase the BM 
dose, which is an important residual site in patients with lymphoma, particularly thos e with follicular 
histology. 
The results described above for incorporation of radiolabeled anti –CD20 antibody therapy for younger 
and older patients with lymphoma undergoing aHSCT, and the data obtained for the patient trial of 
RIC AHSCT, provide the ratio nale for a clinical trial to incorporate an effective targeted anti –tumor 
agent as a component of the RIC AHSCT regimen for patients with lymphoma who are not 
candidates for aHSCT.  
3.6.4 RADIATION DOSIMETRY  
Estimations of Radiation Absorbed Doses (RADs) fo r 111In–Zevalin® and 90Y–Zevalin® were 
performed using sequential Whole (Total) Body Images (WBIs) and MIRDOSE 3  software.20, 41  
Estimated RADs to organs and BM from a course of the Zevalin® therapeutic regimen are 
summarized in TABLE 2.  Absorbed dose es timates for lower large intestine, upper large intestine, and 
small intestine have been modified from the standard MIRDOSE 3  output to account for the 
assumption that activity is within the intestine wall rather that the intestine contents.

3.7 PERIPHERAL BLOOD B CELL DEPLETION WITH RITUXI MAB 
To maximize the therapeutic effects and minimize the side effects of Zevalin, we aim to deplete circulating 
B-lymphocytes by [CONTACT_185445]-111 Zevalin and Y -90 Zevalin. The goal would 
be to deplete circulating B -lymphocytes but not to saturate the binding sites within the lymphoma cells 
(lymph nodes).  To achieve this goal, a careful and individualized dosing of rituximab would be nece ssary.  
From the phase I study of rituximab (65), there was a dose -dependent, rapid, and specific B cell depletion 
in all patients. It is generally agreed that when there is a detectable level of rituximab in serum, circulating 
B cell numbers are minimal.  
 
Pharmacokinetic (PK) data obtained from the patients treated in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_185420]. (66). At [ADDRESS_218928] -treatment, they found the median serum level in 62 
responders was 25.4 μg/ml compared with 5.9 μg/ml in 42 non -responders (p=0.001). In addition, serum 
levels correlated inversely with bulk of disease.  While it is unknown whether the non -responders had less 
than saturating levels of rituximab within the tumo r, it would be reasonable to assume that the serum 
rituximab level of 25 μg/ml may be too high for the current study.  
 
In this study, we consider a rituximab level at 10 μg/ml would be a reasonable target in achieving 
sufficient B cell depletion without s aturating the CD20 binding sites in the malignant lymph nodes.  Since 
we expect some of the study patients may have a preexisting rituximab from prior therapy, we will test the 
15 
IRB # [ZIP_CODE], Version 22   11/25/13 rituximab levels in all study patients. Pre -treatment with rituximab may be giv en on days -21 and -14 
according to its serum level.  
 
The level of Rituxan in the serum is measured in a competitive binding assay using a TRF (time resolved 
fluorometry) format.  An anti -mouse IgG Fab antibody is coated on the plate and then standards, c ontrol 
samples are added in addition to dilutions of the patient‟s serum.  A Europi[INVESTIGATOR_185421].  The Rituxan in the serum competes with the Eu -Rituxan-DTPA and the amount of competition is 
compared to the standard curve.  The assay has  been validated and is performed under SOPs.  This 
assay is performed by a [LOCATION_004] licensed Med Tech who has demonstrated his proficiency in 
performing the assay.  The laboratory is run under the continuing supervision of the Department of 
Pathology.  T he laboratory is operating under CLIA rules and has been inspected by [CONTACT_54796].

4.1 RITUXAN® (IDEC –C2B8 OR RITUXIMAB) Ω §§ A.012 
4.1.1 MODE OF ACTION:  genetically engineered chime ric murine/human MAb directed against 
CD20 antigen on surface of normal and malignant B lymphocytes; an IgG 1 
containing murine V L and VH chain region sequences and human constant region 
sequences; composed of 2 V H chains of 451 aa and 2 V L chains of 213 aa (based on 
cDNA analysis) with molecular weight of ~145 kD; has binding affinity for CD20 antigen 
of ~8.0 nM.  
The Fab domain of Rituxan® binds to the CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes, and the Fc 
domain recruits immune effector functions to mediate B –Cell lysis in vitro.  Possible 
mechanisms of cell lysis include Complement –Dependent Cytotoxicity (CDC) and 
Antibody –Dependent Cell Mediated Cytotoxicity (ADCC).  The antibody has been 
shown to induce apoptosis in the DHL –4 Human B –Cell Lymphoma Line.  
Normal Tissue Cross –Reactivity:  Rituxan® binding was observed on lymphoid cells in 
the thymus, the white pulp of the spleen, and a majority of B lymphocytes in peripheral 
blood and lymph nodes.  Little or no binding was observed in the non –lymphoid tissues 
examined. 
4.1.2 TOXICOLOGY :  infusional toxicity of chills and rigors are common with first administration 
of Rituxan® but rarely with subsequent doses; decreased rate of infusion and 
administration of antihistamines can control these toxicities.

On DAY –21, patients will receive the fixed dose of approximately 5.0 mCi 111In–Zevalin® 
possibly preceded by [CONTACT_185455] 250 mg/m2 Rituxan®; on DAY –14, patients will 
receive 0.4 mCi/kg 90Y–Zevalin®, possibly preceded by [CONTACT_185455] 250 mg/m2 
Rituxan®.  The day -21 and day -14 Rituxan dosing is based on the Rituxan levels in the 
blood which will be drawn on day -23 or -22 (for the imaging d ose), and on day -16 or -15 (for 
the therapy dose) [See figure 7.1.1 above].  
[IP_ADDRESS] RITUXAN® (DAY OF IMAGING):  on DAY –21, if Rituxan® is given, it will be 
administered by [CONTACT_185456] 1 –4 mg/ml in an 
infusion bag containing ei ther 0.9% Sodium Chloride, USP, or 5% Dextrose in 
Water, USP .  This initial Rituxan® infusion will be through a dedicated line.  If 
patient has had Rituxan before, begin infusion at 100 mg/hr.  If no adverse 
reactions occur, escalate rate gradually at 100 mg/hr every 30 minutes to a 
maximum of 400 mg/hr.  If patient has not had Rituxan before, begin infusion 
at 50 mg/hr.  If no adverse reactions occur, escalate rate at 50 mg/hr every 30 
minutes to a maximum of 400 mg/hr.  If hypersensitivity or infusion rel ated 
events develop, the infusion will be temporarily slowed or interrupted.  The 
infusion can be continued at half the previous rate when symptoms abate.  
25 
IRB # [ZIP_CODE], Version 22   11/25/13 Note: prior to the start of Rituxan infusion, blood samples (1 EDTA purple top 
tube and 1 red top tu be) will be obtained for analysis of antibody clearance 
(see [IP_ADDRESS]).  
[IP_ADDRESS] 111IN–ZEVALIN® IMAGING: following the Rituxan® infusion, if given, 111In–Zevalin® 
will be administered over approximately [ADDRESS_218942] 10 mls of normal saline following the 111In–
Zevalin® infusion. 
Whole body gamma camera images will be obtained at approximately 1 –24 
hours, approximately  48–[ADDRESS_218943] scan at approximately 
90–[ADDRESS_218944] –infusion to confirm results.  Exceptions to this time frame 
will be made if the optional scan falls on a weekend or a holiday.  Spot planar 
views and SPECT scans may be obtained at the discretion of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_12749] -PI.  
Blood samples (1 EDTA purple top tube and 1 red top tube) will be obtained at 
approximately time 0 (pre -Rituxan, if given, and pre -In-111-Zevalin), 2 hours,

G.001 – G.002, G004 
7.3.1 DAY –3 TACROLIMUS TREATMENT :  commence Tacrolimus at 0.02 mg/kg iv daily until oral 
intake resumes; then switch to oral at 2 –3x the iv dose and taper based on disease 
status as described in  § 7.8 GUIDELINES FOR TAPERING IMMUNOSUPPRESSION .  Dosing of 
Tacrolimus will be based on adjusted ideal body weight; if actual body weight is < ideal 
body weight, then actual body weight will be used.  
[IP_ADDRESS] GUIDELINES FOR TACROLIMUS DOSE ADJUSTMENT AND MANAGEMENT OF 
TOXICITIES :  if vomiting occurs in ≤ 20 minutes after an oral dose of Tacrolimus, 
the dose should be repeated.  Anti –nausea medications may be given as 
needed.  Intractable nausea and vomiting may require intravenous 
administration of Tacrolimus at one third the oral d ose.  Tacrolimus may cause 
impaired renal function, hyperbilirubinemia, increased serum transaminase 
levels, hypertension, tremor, and seizures.  Impaired renal function may 
require Tacrolimus dose reductions.  Tacrolimus treatment may be 
DISCONTINUED , INTERRUPTED or SUSPENDED at any time for patient refusal to 
continue treatment, severe drug related toxicity or Serious Adverse Event 
(SAE). 
Tacrolimus dose adjustments should not be based exclusively on serum 
levels.  Tacrolimus levels should be used as a gu ide in conjunction with clinical 
observations of the biologic effects of the drug, ( ie, toxicity and 
immunosuppression).  Blood pressure, renal function tests (creatinine, BUN), 
electrolytes and magnesium need to be followed at least 3x/week while 
receiving Tacrolimus at full dose and then twice weekly or per attending until 
Tacrolimus is discontinued.

[IP_ADDRESS] TACROLIMUS BLOOD LEVELS:  Tacrolimus trough levels should be  measured at 
least weekly during the first [ADDRESS_218947] –transplant.  Target levels of 5 –10 
ng/ml are acceptable in patients who manifest no evidence of toxicity or 
GVHD.  Trough plasma levels should be drawn 10 –[ADDRESS_218948] dose 
if possible. 
[IP_ADDRESS] TACROLIMUS DRUG INTERACTIONS  
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Drugs that may INCREASE Tacrolimus levels:  Fluconazole, 
Itraconazole, Ketoconazole, erythromycin, H2 Blockers, Verapamil, 
Diltiazem, Nicardipi[INVESTIGATOR_050], Danazol, Bromocriptine, Metoclopramide, 
Methylprednisolone, Somat ostatin (Octreotide).  
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Drugs that may DECREASE Tacrolimus levels:  Rifampin, 
Phenobarbital, Phenytoin, Carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], Octreotide (may lower 
Serum Levels by [CONTACT_185458]). 
[IP_ADDRESS].3 Drugs that may result in ADDITIVE Nephrotoxicity:  
Aminoglycosides, Amphotericin B, Acyclovir, Furosemide, 
Trimethoprim –Sulfamethoxazole ( TMP –SMX). 
7.3.2 DAY –3 SIROLIMUS TREATMENT :  Sirolimus will be administered at 12 mg orally loading 
dose on DAY –3, followed by 4 mg orally single morning daily dose (target serum level 
3–12 ng/ml by [CONTACT_5004]).  Dosing of Sirolimus will be based on adjusted ideal body 
weight.  If actual body weight is < ideal body weight, actual body weight will be used.  
Taper or continue based on disease status as desc ribed in § 7.8 GUIDELINES FOR 
TAPERING IMMUNOSUPPRESSION . 
[IP_ADDRESS] GUIDELINES FOR SIROLIMUS DOSE ADJUSTMENT AND MANAGEMENT OF TOXICITIES :  
dose adjustments are based on clinical toxicity, blood levels, GVHD and 
clinical judgment involving the rate of rise o r decline of the serum level.  For 
levels < 3 ng/ml, it is suggested that the dose be increased by [CONTACT_3450] 
25% increments no more frequently than every [ADDRESS_218949] 
full milligram until the target range is achieved.  Conversely, for  levels > 12 
ng/ml, it is suggested that the dose be decreased by ~25% no more frequently 
than every 2 days until the target level is achieved.  If v omiting occurs ≤ 20 
minutes of administration the dose should be repeated.  Anti –nausea 
medication may be given as needed.  
28 
IRB # [ZIP_CODE], Version 22   11/25/13 Sirolimus treatment may be DISCONTINUED , INTERRUPTED  or SUSPENDED  at any 
time for patient refusal to continue treatment or drug relat ed SAE (§§ 11.0 
EXTERNAL REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS and 12.0 INTERNAL  REGULATORY 
REQUIREMENTS ).  The most serious reported SAEs from Sirolimus in previous 
clinical studies after HSCT included hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], hypertension, rash, 
thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, a rthralgias, diarrhea and HUS.  
For management of cytopenias, it is recommended that patients receive 
growth factors or transfusions if necessary.  For patients with HUS (defined as 
presence of microangiopathy and rise in serum creatinine > 2x upper limit of  
normal, not attributed to other causes), Sirolimus should be adjusted to 
maintain therapeutic levels; discontinuation of Tacrolimus is recommended in 
this setting, particularly for cases requiring hemodialysis, seizures or severe 
hemolysis.  Plasmapheresi s may be used at the discretion of the treating 
physician.  No dose modification is recommended for hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035]; lipid –
lowering agents should be instituted, with careful attention to the occurrence of 
rhabdomyolysis when HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are used. 
Sirolimus treatment may also be interrupted for inability to swallow due to 
stomatitis; for patients with severe stomatitis who may not be able to resume 
oral intake in several days, MMF may be started as GVHD prophylaxis, at a 
dose of 15 mg/kg intra venously twice a day, until oral intake resumes, when 
Sirolimus may substitute MMF.  
Sirolimus should be adjusted for hepatic impairment, as follows: for bilirubin > 
2.0, reduce maintenance dose by 30%.  Sirolimus may be re –instituted if, in 
the judgment of  the investigator, the primary clinical cause(s) for dose 
adjustment have been resolved.  
[IP_ADDRESS] SIROLIMUS SERUM LEVELS:  Sirolimus trough levels should be measured at least 
weekly during the first [ADDRESS_218950] –transplant.  Levels of 3 –12 ng/ml are 
considered therapeutic.  Trough levels should be measured 20 –[ADDRESS_218951] dose.  
[IP_ADDRESS] SIROLIMUS DRUG INTERACTIONS :  Sirolimus is a substrate for both cytochrome 
CYP3A4 and P –glycoprotein.  
[IP_ADDRESS] DRUGS THAT MAY INCREASE SIROLIMUS BLOOD CONCENTRATIONS  INCLUDE:

IRB # [ZIP_CODE], Version 22   11/25/13 10.2.7 END POINT DEFINITIONS  
[IP_ADDRESS] MAJOR END POINTS OF INTEREST 
[IP_ADDRESS].1  RELAPSE:  return of signs and symptoms of cancer after a period of 
improvement.  
Reappearance of any clinical evidence of lymphoma in a patient who 
has had a CR; relapse for PR is defined as PD relative to disease 
status during the PR; Relapsed Disease  requires the following:  
 appearance of any new lesion or inc rease by ≥ 50% in the size of 
previously involved sites.  
 ≥ 50% increase in greatest diameter of any previously identified node 
> 1 cm in its short axis or in the SPD of > 1 node.  
[IP_ADDRESS].2  RELAPSE –FREE SURVIVAL (RFS):  Defined as the time from transplant  
to the first observation of relapsed disease or death due to any 
cause, whichever occurs first.  If the patient has not relapsed or died, 
relapse-free survival is censored at the time of last follow -up. 
[IP_ADDRESS].3  PROGRESSION –FREE SURVIVAL (PFS):  Time from transplant to 
disease progression or death from NHL. 
[IP_ADDRESS].4  TRANSPLANT –RELATED DEATH (TRD)/T RANSPLANT –RELATED 
MORTALITY (TRM):   death that occurs during transplant admission; 
death due to causes unrelated to the underlying disease; death or 
mortality due to toxicities, adverse  events or side effects occurring 
during or due to treatment; may be due to treatment procedures, 
drug toxicities, allergic reactions, and/or infections; patients relapsing 
are censored as surviving at the time of relapse.  
[IP_ADDRESS].5 MEAN SURVIVAL TIME:  average time that patients in clinical study 
remain alive; time is measured beginning either at diagnosis or start 
of treatment.  
[IP_ADDRESS].6  OVERALL SURVIVAL (OS)/S URVIVAL RATE (SR):  Defined as the time 
from transplant to death d ue to any cause.  If a patient is alive, 
survival time is censored at the time of last follow -up. 
[IP_ADDRESS].7  RESPONSE RATE (RR):  percentage of patients whose cancer shrinks 
or disappears after treatment.  
[IP_ADDRESS] SECONDARY END POINTS OF INTEREST 
[IP_ADDRESS]. 1 DURATION OF RESPONSE /RESPONSE DURATION (DR):  interval from 
onset of response to PD; initial documentation of response until date 
of relapse or PD. 
For patients with PR, measured from initial documentation of PR to 
time when cancer begins to enlarge or s pread again.  
[IP_ADDRESS].2  TIME–TO–[DISEASE]–PROGRESSION (TTP):  interval from first infusion 
to PD; entry onto trial until date of initial observation of PD or death 
due to any cause; measure of time after a disease is diagnosed (or 
treated) until the diseas e starts to get worse.  
40 
IRB # [ZIP_CODE], Version 22   11/25/13 [IP_ADDRESS] PROGRESSION OF DISEASE/PROGRESSIVE DISEASE (PD):  cancer that continues to 
grow or spread, increasing in scope or severity; increase in the size of a tumor 
or spread of cancer in the body.  
50% increase or an increase of 10 c m2 (whichever is smaller) in the sum of 
products of all measurable lesions over smallest sum observed (over baseline 
if no decrease) using the same techniques as baseline, OR clear worsening of 
any evaluable disease, OR reappearance of any lesion which had  disappeared, 
OR appearance of any new lesion/site, OR failure to return for evaluation due to 
death or deteriorating condition (unless clearly unrelated to this cancer); for

not initially involved because of the unpredictable pattern of recurrence in NHL; 
studies will be performed no later than two months after treatment has been 
completed to assess response; interval may vary with type of treatment, eg, a 
longer period may be more appropriate for biologic agents where the

11.3 DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING  
A) Definition of Risk Level   
 
This is a Risk Level 4 study, as defined in the “City of Hope Data and Safety Monitoring 
Plan”, http://www.coh.org/dsmc/Pages/forms -and-procedures.aspx  involving the use of RIT 
and chemotherapy  as preparative conditioning for patients undergoing allogeneic 
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for treatment of high -risk non-Hodgkin Lymphoma . 
Given that 1) the preparative regimen is considered novel and 2) if successful, the impact of 
this treatment on high -risk lymphoma may be great, this protocol has been classified as a Risk 
Level 4 study.  
42 
IRB # [ZIP_CODE], Version 22   11/25/13  
B) Monitoring and Personnel Responsible for Monitoring  
The Protocol Management Team (PMT) consisting of the PI, Collaborating Investigator, 
CRA/protocol n urse, and statistician is responsible for monitoring the data and safety of this 
study, including implementation of the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_36887].

Data and safety will be reported to the COH DSMC using the PMT report and submitted 
quarterly from the anniversary date of activation.  Protocol specific data collection will include 
the following items: (on Teleform and MIDAS case report forms ) patient-, donor-, disease-, 
treatment-characteristics, toxicity/complication data, and outcome data (e.g., disease status 
post transplant and vital status).  From these data the PMT will monitor: 1) the p atients ‟ ability 
to tolerate the conditioning regimen, 2) complication/toxicity data watching for an excessive 
events including infections, delayed engraftment, and acute - chronic- GVHD, and 3) treatment 
related mortality events.  
 
C) Definitions 
 
Adverse event (AE) - An adverse event is any untoward medical experience or change of an 
existing condition that occurs during or after treatment, whether or not it is considered to be 
related to the protocol intervention.  
 
Unexpected  Adverse Event [21 CFR 312.32  (a) – An adverse event is unexpected if it is not 
listed in the investigator‟s brochure and/or package insert; is not listed at the specificity or 
severity that has been observed; is not consistent with the risk information described in the 
protocol and/o r consent; is not an expected natural progression of any underlying disease, 
disorder, condition, or predisposed risk factor of the research participant experiencing the 
adverse event.  
 
Expected Adverse Event  - Any event that does not meet the criteria for  an unexpected event 
OR is an expected natural progression of any underlying disease, disorder, condition, or 
predisposed risk factor of the research participant experiencing the adverse event  
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) [21 CFR 312.32] is defined as any expected or unexpected 
adverse event  that results in any of the following outcomes:  
 Death 
 Is life-threatening event (places the subject at immediate risk of death from the event 
as it occurred);  
 Unplanned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_91589] 24 hours   or prolongation of existing

 A persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
 A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 Secondary Malignancy  
 Any other adverse event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may 
jeopardize the subject‟s health an d may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed above (examples of such events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in the emergency room or at home, blood 
dyscrasias o r convulsions that do not re sult in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse).  
 
Unanticipated problem (UP)  – Any incident, experience or outcome that meets all three  of 
the following criteria:  
1. Unexpected (in term nature, severity, or frequency) g iven the following: a) the research 
procedures described in the protocol -related documents such as the IRB approved 
research protocol, informed consent document or Investigator Brochure (IB); and b) the 
characteristics of the subject population being studi ed; AND 
2. Related or possibly related to participation in the research (possibly related means there is 
a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcomes may have been caused 
by [CONTACT_36923], devices or procedures involved in the research); AND 
3. Suggests that the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm (including 
physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than previously known or recognized.

years was estimated to be approximately 36%27-31.  Assuming a non -inferiority null hypothesis with a 20% 
delta bound, a test with a one -sided type [ADDRESS_219001] 80% power for rejecting the 
inferiority hypothesis if the long -run relapse rate was in fact 0.36.  In addition, approximately 15 patients 
(of the required 46) will have samples collected pre - post-AHCT as part of c ostimulatory studies.  
Products from sibling donors will also be studied among this subset of patients.  The expected number is 
8, which is approximately 50 -60%, which aligns with the expected rate of allo transplants that will utilize a 
sibling donor.  The projected total study accrual, including primary study objective and secondary 
costimulatory studies, is 54 patients (46 patients + 8 donors).  
  
Phase II Monitoring            
 
Early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_185429] h owever, there will be no interim 
analysis for efficacy. Toxicities will be recorded using two distinct grading systems; the modified Bearman 
Scale (Bearman, S., et al, JCO, Vol 6, No 10 (Oct), 1988, pp1562 -1568. See appendix I for details.) and 
the NCI CTC AE 3.0 Scale. Generally, the modified Bearman Scale will be used to define (grade) „early 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]‟ events (toxicities), and the NCI CTCAE 3.0 Scale will be used for reporting adverse events. The 
only exception relates to how h ematologic toxicities are gra ded and incorporated into the early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_31732]. For hematologic toxicities the CTCAE 3.0 Scale will be used. The table below will be consulted as 
relevant toxicities are encountered, so there will be no accrual -based interim analysis point.  
 
Early Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_2121]: For each adverse outcome, stop if the cumulative number of patients reaches or 
exceeds the following limits:

Any patient who receives treatment on this protocol will be evaluable for toxicity. Each patient will be 
assessed periodically according to the treatment schedule for the development of any toxicity. The toxicity 
rule for safety will be assessed as each pa tient reaches day +[ADDRESS_219003] transplantation. If more than the 
specified number of patients (noted in the table above) have significant treatment related toxicities, then 
the safety of the study will be evaluated.  
 
Analysis of Clinical Endpoints  
 
Toxicities observed will be summarized in terms of type (organ affected or laboratory determination), 
severity (by [CONTACT_185470]) and time of onset. For 
grade [ADDRESS_219004] 95% confidence limits for a binomial parameter. Additional analyses will be 
48 
IRB # [ZIP_CODE], Version 22   11/25/[ADDRESS_219005] transplant toxicity/complication profile including acute and chronic GvHD 
and infectious complications.  
 
Descriptive statistics will  be used to characterize the expression of six costimulatory molecules (PD -1, 
CTLA-4, CD28, ICOS, OX40 and 4 -1BB) pre- post- RIT based ASCT. Exploratory analyses will also be 
performed to assess the impact of these molecules on the NK and T cells of lympho ma patients pre - post- 
RIT based ASCT.  
 
The product -limit method of Kaplan and Meier will be utilized to estimate time -to-event endpoints such as 
relapse/progression -free survival, overall survival, and non -relapse/progression mortality rate. We will 
consider univariate Cox models for the analysis of potential prognostic factors of time -to-event endpoints, 
including such factors as histologic grade, age at transplant, and disease stage as independent variables, 
first performing diagnostics to confirm the va lidity of the proportional hazards assumption. Descriptive 
comparisons with recent historical data from similar patient populations will be made to evaluate 
differences in relapse/progression -free survival, overall survival, relapse/progression rate, and t oxicities.

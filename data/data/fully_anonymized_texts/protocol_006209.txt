 3.0 OBJECTIVE(S) & HYPOT HESIS(ES)  
3.1 Primary Objectives & Hypothesis  
1.  To collect tumor tissue pre - and post-  treatment with MK- 3475 for studies of mech anism 
of action of PD-1 blockade with pembrolizumab . 
Hypothesis: Collection of paired tumor tissue samples will be feasible. P embrolizumab will 
result in a measurable change in tumor immune biomarkers.  This is a hypothesis generating 
trial which will evaluate change in numerous tumor immune biomarkers.  
2.  To evaluate safety, tolerability and adverse experience profile of pembrolizumab  in the 
peri-operative setting.  
Hypothesis: Safety profile of pembrolizumab  administered in the peri - and post- operative 
setting is similar to the overall safety profile with an infrequent occurrence of grade 3/[ADDRESS_151186] of PD- 1 blockade with pembrolizumab  on immune biomarkers in 
PBMC  and serum from subjects before and at serial time points after treatment with a 
single dose of pembrolizumab . 
3.  To evaluate the disease -free-survival ( DFS) in subjects with high risk MEL receiving 
pembrolizumab  peri-operatively.  
4.  To evaluate overall survival ( OS) in subjects with high risk MEL receiving pembrolizumab  
peri-operatively.  
5.  To describe the rate of recurrence and time to disease recurrence for subjects on the 
study.  
4.0 BACKGROUND & RATIONA LE 
4.1 Background  
Advanced melanoma remains a very high risk malignancy with high mortality despi[INVESTIGATOR_133590]. Even after curative intent surgery, up to 70% of patients 
with high risk stage III melanoma develop recurr ent metastatic disease and die.  
UPCC# [ZIP_CODE]: Tissue Collection Study of Pembrolizumab in Advanced Melanoma  
 
Version Date: 06/18/[ADDRESS_151187]  an anti -tumor 
response by [CONTACT_133607]- 1 mediated negative regulation on T lymphocytes, which are 
prime mediators of tumor immu nosurveillance. Programmed Death -1 (PD -1) signaling 
involves binding to several discrete ligands, including PD -L1 and PD- L2. PD -L1 is often 
expressed within the tumor microenvironment including cancer cells and macrophages 
whereas PD -L2 is expressed primarily on professional antigen presenting cells. PD- 1 
negatively regulates the effector phase of the T cell response after ligation of PD- L1 to the 
receptor. Antibodies that block the PD- L1/PD -[ADDRESS_151188] immune surveillance in controlling outgrowth of neoplastic 
transformation has been known for decades [1].  Accumulating evidence shows a 
correlation between tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in cancer tissue and favorable 
prognosis  in various malignancies [2; 3; 4; 5; 6].  In particular, the presence of CD8+ T -cells 
and the ratio of CD8+ effector T -cells / FoxP3+ regulatory T -cells seems to correlate with 
improved prognosis and long -term survival in many solid tumors.  
The PD -[ADDRESS_151189] hijacked by [CONTACT_55548].  The normal function of PD -1, expressed on the cell surface of activated T -
cells under healthy conditions, is to down- modulate unwanted or excessive immune 
responses, including autoimmune reactions.  PD -1 (encoded by [CONTACT_13228]1) is an Ig 
superfamily member related to CD28 and CTLA -4 which has been shown to negatively 
regulate antigen receptor signaling upon engagement of its ligands (PD- L1 and/or PD -L2) [7; 
8].  The  structure of murine PD- 1 has been resolved [9].  PD -1 and family members are type 
I transmembrane glycoproteins containing an Ig Variable -type (V -type) domain responsible 
for ligand binding and a cytoplasmic tail which is responsible for the binding of si gnaling 
molecules.  The cytoplasmic tail of PD -1 contains 2 tyrosine -based signaling motifs, an 
UPCC# [ZIP_CODE]: Tissue Collection Study of Pembrolizumab in Advanced Melanoma  
 
Version Date: 06/18/201 8   5 
 immunoreceptor tyrosine -based inhibition motif (ITIM) and an immunoreceptor tyrosine -
based switch motif (ITS M). Following T -cell stimulation, PD -1 recruits the tyrosine 
phosphatases SHP -1 and SHP -2 to the ITSM motif within its cytoplasmic tail, leading to the 
dephosphorylation of effector molecules such as CD3ζ, PKCθ and ZAP70 which are involved 
in the CD3 T -cell signaling cascade [7; 10; 11; 12].  The mechanism by [CONTACT_13209]- [ADDRESS_151190] from that of CTLA -4 as both molecules 
regulate an overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_77971] [13; 14].  PD -1 was shown to be expressed 
on activated lymphocytes including peripheral CD4+ a nd CD8+ T -cells, B- cells, T regs and 
Natural Killer cells [15; 16].  Expression has also been shown during thymic development on 
CD4-CD8- (double negative) T -cells as well as subsets of macrophages and dendritic cells 
[17].  The ligands for PD -1 (PD -L1 and  PD-L2) are constitutively expressed or can be induced 
in a variety of cell types, including non- hematopoietic tissues , as well, as in various tumors 
[18; 19; 20; 13].  Both ligands are type I transmembrane receptors containing both IgV - and 
IgC-like domains in the extracellular region and contain short cytoplasmic regions with no 
known signaling motifs.  Binding of either PD- [ADDRESS_151191] notably on vascular endothelium, whereas PD -L2 protein is 
only detectably expressed on antigen -presenting cells found in lymphoid tissue or chronic 
inflammatory environments.  PD -L2 is thought to control immune T -cell activation in 
lymphoid organs, whereas PD -L1 serves to dampen unwarranted T -cell function in 
peripheral tissues [13].  Although healthy organs express little (if any) PD -L1, a variety of 
cancers were demonstrated to express abundant levels of this T -cell inhibitor.  PD -1 has 
been suggested to regulate tumor -specific T -cell expansion in subjects with melanoma 
(MEL) [21].  This suggests that the PD- 1/PD -L1 pathway plays a critical role in tumor 
immune evasion and should be considered as an attractive target for therapeutic 
intervention.  
Pembrolizumab  (previously known as SCH 900475 and MK- 3475) is a potent and highly 
selective humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the IgG4/kappa isotype designed to 
directly block the interaction between PD- 1 and  its ligands, PD -L1 and P D-L2. 
4.1.2 Preclinical and Clinical Trial Data  
Refer to the Investigator’s Brochure for Preclinical and Clinical data.  
4.2 Rationale  
Pembrolizumab  is a highly selective, humanized monoclonal antib ody (IgG4/kappa isotype) 
that di rectly blocks the interaction between PD- 1 and its ligands, PD- L1 and PD -L2, with 
safety and efficacy demonstrated in melanoma and other advanced solid tumors . 
Unfortunately, little is known about the mechanism of action of pembrolizumab  in tumor 
tissue and its interaction with other immune regulatory pathways.  
 
UPCC# [ZIP_CODE]: Tissue Collection Study of Pembrolizumab in Advanced Melanoma  
 
Version Date: 06/18/[ADDRESS_151192] options for patients with resected high risk melanoma include close 
observation, high dose interferon, or clinical trials, as high dose interferon has not 
demonstrated a definite overall survival benefit in this patient population. Effective 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_133591] a nd improve survival are needed.  
Anti-cancer activities by [CONTACT_14181]-  PD-1mAb seen in MEL patients thus far provide a strong 
rationale for evaluation of pembrolizumab  in MEL patients with high risk resectable disease. 
Pembrolizumab  has been well tolerated with dose levels up to 200 mg  and has shown a 
promising response rate of 41% in patients with advanced melanoma, which is much higher 
than the 10 -15% response rate ob served in ipi[INVESTIGATOR_133592]. The existing data 
from the ongoing pembrolizumab  study PN001 support the evaluation of the safety and 
efficacy of pembrolizumab  in patients with resectable high risk MEL, for whom additional 
treatment options are needed.  
Additional studies in human tumor tissue are needed to define the mechanism of action of 
PD-[ADDRESS_151193] 1 
dose of pembrolizumab . 
4.2.2 Rationale for Dose Selection/Regimen/Modification  
The dose of pembrolizumab , 200mg intravenous every [ADDRESS_151194] 
UPCC# [ZIP_CODE]: Tissue Collection Study of Pembrolizumab in Advanced Melanoma  
 
Version Date: 06/18/201 8   7 
 duration of treatment for adjuvant high dose interferon, which is the only approved 
adjuvant therapy for melanoma.  
Biosamples (blood and tumor) obtained from subjects before and at serial time points 
during treatment will be analyzed. High priority assays will be performed as indicated 
below. Second priority assays will be performed as the budget allows.  
High priority  assays:  
1.  Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) will be obtained at various time 
points at baseline and during this protocol, including before and after treatment and 
before and after surgery. PBMC s will be analyzed by [CONTACT_133608] T cell subsets. This assay will include intracellular staining for multiple T 
cell cytokines  and transcription factors in order to determine multifunctionality. 
Expression of inhibitory receptors including PD- [ADDRESS_151195] whether changes in such pathways on T occurs following 
treatment.  
 
2.  Tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) will be harvested from tumor biopsies before 
and after treatment to analyze treatment- induced effects on TILs using a similar 
multiparameter flow cytometry assay described above for PBMC.  
 
Second priority  assays:  
1.  Inflammatory cytokines/chemokines. Serum obtained at various times at baseline 
and during the protocol will be analyzed using Luminex bead array and Invitrog en 
30-plex kits, which can simultaneously quantify/determine concentrations of 30 
important factors, including IL- 1, TNF -alpha, IL -6 and others.  
 
2.  T-cells within TIL can also be further expanded in vitro when possible using 
artificial APC systems routinely used in the laboratory to facilitate further study T -
cell specificity and function.  
 
3.  Deep sequencing of the TCR (along with tumor and germline DNA) will also be 
performed when feasible from blood and tumor as a novel way to measure tumor -
spec ific T -cell responses induced by [CONTACT_3148]. This method does not require a priori 
understanding of a particular tumor antigen or MHC. Of particular interest will be 
evidence of TCR clones increasing in the circulation after therapy that are also found 
in the subject’s tumor, per novel analytic methodologies noted in the preliminary 
data section. Such observations would be consistent with a vaccine effect of 
therapy.  
UPCC# [ZIP_CODE]: Tissue Collection Study of Pembrolizumab in Advanced Melanoma  
 
Version Date: 06/18/[ADDRESS_151196] therapy will be tested in vitro in T -
cell responder assays. For patients who are HLA- A2+, functional responses and 
peptide -MHC quantification will be measured for a panel of melanoma associated 
antigens , as well as , viral antigens as a control. Functional measurements can 
include cytokine production, CD107a mobilization, and lysis against peptide -pulsed 
targets or tumor cells lines expressing the melanoma antigen. In addition, for 
functional assessments of T cells without regar d to the patients MHC, we will use 
autologous CD40- activated B cells electroporated with viral or tumor antige n mRNA 
as in vitro stimulators.  
 
5.  New antibodies with reactivity to defined antigens will be measured in serum 
collected before and during trea tment. When possible, we will use the ProtoArray 
protein array, which uses chip- based technology to profile 9,000 proteins. Analysis 
will be by [CONTACT_133609]. The induction of high titer antibodies to defined 
tumor antigens not only reflects a humora l immune response to treatment but also 
a cellular response.  
 
6.  Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and circulating tumor DNA will be measured in the 
blood pre - and post- treatment using promising cell surface markers in collaboration 
with [CONTACT_133632].  Levels of circulating tumor material will be correlated to 
tumor burden and can potentially afford important information with regards to 
response to therapy and prognosis . 
 
Assays noted above may be performed by [CONTACT_133610]/industry collaborators as relationship s are developed in 
the future.

and lasts for at least 1 week then patients should be discontinued.  
b If symptoms resolve within one hour of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_13056], the infusion may be restarted at 50% of the original infusion rate   (e.g., fro m 100 mL/hr to 50 
mL/hr).  Otherwise dosing will be held until symptoms resolve and the subject should be premedicated  for the next scheduled dose; Refer to  Table 4 – Infusion 
Treatment Guidelines for further management details.  
c Patients with intolerable or persistent Grade [ADDRESS_151226] dose.  
 
With investigator and medical monitor agreement, subjects with a laboratory adverse event 
still at Grade 2 after 12 weeks may continue treatment in the trial only if asymptomatic.  For 
information on the management of adverse  events, see Section 5. 4.1. 
Subjects who experience a recurrence of the same severe or life- threatening event at the 
same grade or greater with re -challenge of pembrolizumab  should be permanently 
discontinued from trial treatment.  
5.2.2 Timing of Dose Administra tion 
Trial treatment should be administered on Day 1 of each cycle after all 
procedures/assessments have been completed as detailed on the Trial Flow Chart (Section 
6.0).  Trial treatment may be administered up to 5  days before or after the scheduled Day 1  
of each cycle due to administrative reasons.  
All trial treatments will be administered on an outpatient basis.  
Pembrolizumab  will be administered as a 30 minute IV infusion every 3 weeks .  Every effort 
should be made to target infusion timing to be as cl ose to 30 minutes as possible.  
The treatment cycle interval  may be increased by 1  wee k when  restarting  pembrolizumab 
that was held due to:  
• Grade 2 toxicities that did not resolve to Grade 0 -1 within 4 weeks  
• Grade 3 or  4 toxicities  
Trial Blinding/Masking  
This is an open -label trial; therefore, the Sponsor -investigator , sub -investigators  and subject 
will know the treatment administered.

 5.3 Concomitant Medications/Vaccinations (allowed & prohibited) 
Medications or vaccinations specifically prohibited in the exc lusion criteria are not allowed 
during the ongoing trial. If there is a clinical indication for one of these or other medications 
or vaccinations specifically prohibited during the trial, discontinuation from trial therapy or 
vaccination may be required.  The investigator must  discuss any questions regarding this 
with the Sponsor -Investigator and medical monitor. The final decision on any supportive 
therapy or vaccination rests with the investigator and/or the subject's primary  physician. 
However, the decision to continue the subject on trial therapy or vaccination schedule 
requires the mutual agreement of the Sponsor -Investigator, the treating investigator , 
medical monitor and the subject.  
5.3.[ADDRESS_151227]’s welfare may be 
administered at the discretion of the investigator in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_133594].  
All concomitant medications will be recorded on the case report form (CRF) including all 
prescription, over- the-counter (OTC), herbal supplements, and IV medications and fluids.  If 
changes occur during the trial period, documentation of drug dosage, frequency, route, and 
date will also be included on the CRF.  
All concomitant med ications received within [ADDRESS_151228] dose of trial treatment should be 
recorded for  SAEs and ECIs as defined in Section 7.2.  
5.3.2 Prohibited Concomitant Medications  
Subjects are prohibited from receiving the following therapi[INVESTIGATOR_80025] (including retreatment for post- complete response relapse) of this trial:  
1.  Anti -cancer  systemic chemotherapy, immune  or biological therapy  
2.  Investigational agents other than pembrolizumab

Mist®) are live attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed.  
5.  Oral g lucocorticoids for any purpose other than to modulate symptoms from an 
event of clinical interest of suspected immunologic etiology .  The use of physiologic 
doses of corticosteroids may be approved after consultation with the Sponsor -
Investigator and medical monitor.   Inhaled and topi[INVESTIGATOR_12977].  
Subjects who, in the assessment by [CONTACT_093], require the use of any of the 
aforementioned treatments for clinical management should be removed from the trial.  
Subjects  may receive other medications that the investigator or qualified designee  deems to 
be medically necessary.  
The Exclusion Criteria describes other medications which are prohibited in this trial.  
There are no prohibited therapi[INVESTIGATOR_3927]- Treatment Follow -up Phase.  
5.4 Rescue Medications & Supportive Care  
5.4.1 Supportive Care Guidelines  
Subjects should receive appropriate supportive care measures as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_133612] .   Suggested supportive care measures for the 
management of adverse events with potential immunologic etiology are outlined below. 
Where appropriate, these guidelines include the use of oral or intravenous treatment with 
corticosteroids as well as additional anti-inflammatory agents if symptoms do not improve 
with administration of corticosteroids.   Note that several courses of steroid tapering may 
be necessary as symptoms may worsen when the steroid dose is decreased. For each 
disorder, attempts should be ma de to rule out other causes such as metastatic disease or 
bacterial or viral infection, which might require additional supportive care. The treatment 
guidelines are intended to be applied when the investigator determines the events to be 
related to pembrol izumab.  
Note: if after the evaluation the event is determined not to be related, the investigator does 
not need to follow the treatment guidance (as outlined below). Refer to Section 5.2.1 for 
dose modification.  
It may be necessary to perform conditional procedures such as bronchoscopy, endoscopy, 
or skin photography as part of evaluation of the event.  
• Pneumonitis:  
o For Grade 2 events, treat with systemic corticosteroids. When symptoms 
improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continue d 
over no less than 4 weeks.  
UPCC# [ZIP_CODE]: Tissue Collection Study of Pembrolizumab in Advanced Melanoma  
 
Version Date: 06/18/201 8   18 
 o For Grade 3 -4 events, immediately treat with intravenous steroids.  
Administer additional anti- inflammatory measures, as needed.  
o Add prophylactic antibiotics for opportunistic infections in the case of 
prolonged steroid adminis tration . 
Diarrhea /Colitis : 
Subjects should be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of enterocolitis (such as 
diarrhea, abdominal pain, blood or mucus in stool, with or without fever) and of bowel 
perforation (such as peritoneal signs and ileus).  
o All subjects who experience diarrhea/colitis should be advised to drink liberal 
quantities of clear fluids.  If sufficient oral fluid intake is not feasible, fluid 
and electrolytes should be substituted via IV infusion.  For Grade 2 or higher 
diarrhea, conside r GI consultation and endoscopy to confirm or rule out 
colitis.  
o For Grade 2 diarrhea/colitis, administer oral corticosteroids.  
o For Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea/colitis, treat with intravenous steroids follow ed by 
[CONTACT_78018].  
o When symptoms improve to  Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started 
and continued over no less than 4 weeks.  
• Type 1 diabetes mellitus (if new onset, including diabetic ketoacidosis [DKA]) or ≥ 
Grade 3 Hyperglycemia, if associated with ketosis (ketonuria) or metabolic acidos is 
(DKA)  
o For T1DM  or Grade 3- 4 Hyperglycemia  
 Insulin replacement therapy is recommended for Type I diabetes 
mellitus and for Grade 3 -4 hyperglycemia associated with metabolic 
acidosis or ketonuria.  
 Evaluate patients with serum glucose and a metabolic panel, urine 
ketones, glycosylated hemoglobin, and C -peptide.  
• Hypophysitis : 
o For Grade 2  events, treat with corticosteroids. When symptoms improve to 
Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over no less 
than 4 weeks. Replacement of appropriate hormones may be required as the 
steroid dose is tapered.  
o For Grade 3 -4 events , treat with an initial dose of IV corticosteroids followed 
by [CONTACT_78019]. When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid 
UPCC# [ZIP_CODE]: Tissue Collection Study of Pembrolizumab in Advanced Melanoma  
 
Version Date: 06/18/201 8   19 
 taper should be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks. Replacement 
of appropriate hormones may be required as t he steroid dose is tapered.  
• Hyperthyroidism or Hypothyroidism : 
Thyroid disorders can occur at any time during treatment. Monitor patients for 
changes in thyroid function (at the start of treatment, periodically during treatment, 
and as indicated based on c linical evaluation) and for clinical signs and symptoms of 
thyroid disorders.  
o Grade 2 hyperthyroidism events (and Grade 2- 4 hypothyroidism):  
 In hyperthyroidism, non- selective beta -blockers (e.g. propranolol) are 
suggested as initial therapy.  
 In hypothyroidism, thyroid hormone replacement therapy, with 
levothyroxine or liothyroinine, is indicated per standard of care.  
o Grade 3- 4 hyperthyroidism  
 Treat with an initial dose of IV corticosteroid followed by [CONTACT_79918]. When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid 
taper should be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks. 
Replacement of appropriate hormones may be required as the steroid 
dose is tapered.  
• Hepatic : 
o For Grade 2 events, monitor liver function tests more frequently until returned 
to baseline values (consider weekly).  
 Treat with IV or oral corticosteroids  
o For Grade 3- 4 events, treat with intravenous corticosteroids for 24 to 48 hours.  
o When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, a steroid taper should be started 
and continued over no l ess than 4 weeks.  
• Renal Failure or Nephritis : 
o For Grade 2 events, treat with corticosteroids.  
o For Grade 3 -4 events, treat with systemic corticosteroids.  
o When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started 
and continued over no less than 4 weeks.  
• Management of Infusion Reactions : Signs and symptoms usually develop during or 
shortly after drug infusion and generally resolve completely within 24 h ours of 
completion of infusion.

5.5 Diet/Activity/Other Considerations  
5.5.[ADDRESS_151231] -feeding women may be enrolled if they are willing to use 2 methods of birth 
control or are considered highly unlikely to conceive.  Highly unlikely to conceive is defined 
as 1) surgically sterilized, or 2) postmenopausal (a woman who is ≥45 years of age and has 
not had menses for greater  than 1 year will be considered postmenopausal), or 3) not 
heterosexually active for the duration of the study. Male subjects of reproductive potential 
must agree to avoid impregnating a partner while receiving study drug and for [ADDRESS_151232] dose of study therapy.  
The following are considered adequate barrier method s of contraception: diaphragm, 
condom, copper intrauterine device, sponge, or spermicide. Appropriate hormonal 
contraceptives will include any registered and marketed contraceptive agent that contains 
an estrogen and/or a progestational agent (including or al, subcutaneous, intrauterine, or 
intramuscular agents).  
Subjects should be informed that taking the study medication may involve unknown risks to 
the fetus (unborn baby) if pregnancy were to occur during the study. In order to participate 
in the study , they must adhere  to the contraception requirement (described above) for the 
duration of the study and during the  follow -up period defined in section 7. 6.2-Reporting of 
Pregnancy and Lactation to the Sponsor -Investigator  and to [COMPANY_006]. If there is any question 
that a subject will not reliably comply with the requirements for contraception, that subject 
should not be entered into the study.  
UPCC# [ZIP_CODE]: Tissue Collection Study of Pembrolizumab in Advanced Melanoma  
 
Version Date: 06/18/[ADDRESS_151233]’s status until the pregnancy has  been completed or 
terminated. The outcome of the pregnancy will be reported to the Sponsor -Investigator  and 
to [COMPANY_006] without delay and within 24 hours if the outcome is a serious adverse experience 
(e.g., death, abortion, congenital anomaly, or other disabling or life -threatening 
complicat ion to the mother or newborn). The study investigator will make every effort to 
obtain permission to follow the outcome of the pregnancy and report the condition of the 
fetus or newborn to the Sponsor.  If a male subject impregnates his female partner the 
study personnel at the site must be informed immediately and the pregnancy re ported to 
the Sponsor -Investigator  and to [COMPANY_006] and followed as described above and in Section 
7.6.2. 
5.5.[ADDRESS_151234] Withdrawal/Discontinuation Criteria  
Subjects may withdraw consent at any time for any reason or be dropped from the trial at 
the discretion of the investigator should any untowar d effect occur. In addition, a subject 
may be withdrawn by [CONTACT_122918], the trial plan is violated, or for administrative and/or other saf ety reasons.  
Specific details regarding discontinuation or withdrawal a re provided in Section 7.1. 2 – 
Other Procedures.  
A subject must be discontinued from the trial for any of the following reasons:  
1.  The subject or legal representative withdraws consent.  
2.  Confirmed radiographic disease progression  
3.  Unacceptable adverse experiences as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS]  
4.  Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment 
5.  Investigator’s decision to withdraw the subject 
6.  The subject has a confirmed positive serum pregnancy test 
7.  Noncompliance with trial treatment or procedure requirements  
UPCC# [ZIP_CODE]: Tissue Collection Study of Pembrolizumab in Advanced Melanoma  
 
Version Date: 06/18/[ADDRESS_151235] to follow- up 
9.  Administrative reasons  
After the end of treatment (C4 of pembrolizumab  per trial flow chart,  section 6.0) , each 
subject will be followed for 30 days for adverse event monitoring (serious advers e events 
will be collected for 90 days after the end of treatment as described in Section 7.2).  
Subjects will have post- treatment follow- up for disease st atus until disease recurrence, 
withdrawing consent or becoming lost to follow -up. After documented disease progression 
each subject will be followed by [CONTACT_80075], withdrawal of 
consent, or the end of the study, whichever oc curs first.  
5.7 Clinical Criteria for Early Trial Termination  
The study will be terminated early if there is evidence that the rate of DLTs  is greater than 
33%. A DLT is defined as any grade [ADDRESS_151236]- surgery . Enrollment will be terminated if the data indicate 
that the rate of DLTs , as defined above, is > 33%. There are published data on the safety of 
Pembrolizumab  in other populations of melanoma patients . Thus, w e will assume a 
modestly  informative beta  (.5,1.5) prior which is equivalent to  information on 2 treated 
patients. Given the prior and the observed data, the Bayesian posterior probability that the 
toxicity rate exceeds 33% , is calculated. If the number of patients with a DLT equals or 
exceeds  the numbe r in the table below, then it is likely  that the toxicity rate is 
unacceptable, as noted by [CONTACT_133613].

 [IP_ADDRESS]  Tumor Tissue Collection and Correlative Studies Blood Sampling  
Biosamples (blood and tumor tissue) obtained from subjects before  and at serial time points 
during treatment will be analyzed. Tissue will be collected according to the Trial Flow Chart -  
Section 6.0.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Laboratory Procedures/Assessment  
Laboratory tests for screening or entry must be performed within [ADDRESS_151252] be reviewed by [CONTACT_133615] t. 
The total amount of blood/tissue to be drawn/collected over the course of the trial (from 
pre-trial to post -trial visits), including approximate blood/tissue volumes drawn/collected 
by [CONTACT_133616] l course of the 
subject and length of time on trial.  
In melanoma patients, presence of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes correlates with improved 
prognosis with CD8 T cells being the primary mediators of tumor  lysis, while CD4+FoxP3+ 
Tregs result in immune su ppression. As a result , a high CD8:Treg ratio correlates with a 
balance in favor of anti- tumor immunity. Indeed, CD8:Treg ratio has  been shown to 
correlate with survival in ovarian cancer (Sato PNAS 2005), and therefore is an ideal primary 
endpoint that is  reasonable biologically and may be meaningful clinically.  
 
We will analyze a population of terminally exhausted T cells defined as Eomeshi PD1hi by 
[CONTACT_4133]. Previous work from the Wherry lab has shown differential exhaustion 
profiles including a terminally exhausted Eomeshi PD1hi population of cells which do not 
respond to anti -PDL1 therapy in vitro in contrast to a TbethiiPD1int (less exha usted 
phenotype) population of T cells that do respond well to PD -L1 blockade in vitro. (Paley, 
Wherry Science 2012) Quantification of the terminally exhausted T cell population (Eomeshi 
PD1hi population) may be of prognostic significance as we hypothesize  that a higher 
percentage of Eomeshi PD1hi T cells pre and post PD- [ADDRESS_151253] anti PD- 1 therapy via flow cytome try with Ki67  and Granzyme B to see 
if pembrolizumab is able to restore T cell function in the terminally exhausted (Eomeshi 
PD1hi population) T cell populations, as indicated by [CONTACT_133617]67 and Granzyme B in the se 
T cells after PD -1 blockade.  
 
Analysis of multiple other inhibitory T cell markers including CTLA4, LAG3, TIM3, 2B4, and 
CD160 will be done with quantification of MFI. Tumor specific T cells from melanoma TILs 
show significant exhaustion with upregulation of multiple inhibitory markers. (Baitsch J Clin 
Invest 2011)  PD -[ADDRESS_151254] differential effects on these markers (may increase or 
decrease their expression).  For example, disruption of the PD1 -PDL1 axis by [CONTACT_14181] - PDL-1

Version Date: 06/18/201 8   34 
 therapy results in decreased expression of LAG -3 and upregulation of PD- 1 in a T cell 
exhaustion model (chronic viral infection model). In this T cell exhaustion model, 
combination therapy with anti - LAG3 and anti – PDL1 increased antigen specific T cells, T cell 
function, as well as viral control. (Blackburn, Wherry Nat Immunol 2009 ).  As a result, 
assessing the effect of PD- 1 blockade on other inhibitory molecules will be valuable in 
determining immune target candidates for combination immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_133598]- 1 
blockade.  
 
7.1.2 Other Procedures  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Withdrawal/Discontinuation 
When a subject discontinues/withdraws prior to trial completion, all applicable activities 
scheduled for the final trial visit  should be performed at the time of discontinuation.  Any 
adverse events which are present at the time of discontinuation/withdrawal should be 
followed in accordance with the safety requirements outlined in Section 7.2 -  Assessing and 
Recording Adverse Events.  
7.1.3 Visit Requirements  
Visit requirements are outlined in Section 6.0 -  Trial Flow Chart. Specific procedure -related 
details are provided above in Section 7.1 -  Trial Procedures.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Screening  
Screening requirements are outlined in Section 6.[ADDRESS_151255] is able to 
undergo collection of the screening period tumor specimen and meets all other eligibility 
requirements, the subjec t can be enrolled in the study.  
Subjects may be rescreened after initially failing to meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria. 
Results from assessments performed during the initial screening period are acceptable in 
lieu of a repeating a screening test if performed within the specified time frame and the 
results meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Treatment Period  
Subjects who have signed informed consent, are eligible for the study and who have 
undergone the screening tumor biopsy can be enrolled on the study and must receive the 
week 0 (cycle 1) treatment with pembrolizumab  within [ADDRESS_151256] dose of pembrolizumab (up to 
14 days after the initial screening biopsy). If therapy cannot be started within this time 
frame, the patient will be remov ed from the study and replaced.  
 
UPCC# [ZIP_CODE]: Tissue Collection Study of Pembrolizumab in Advanced Melanoma  
 
Version Date: 06/18/[ADDRESS_151257] then undergo a complete resection of their remaining tumor within 3 weeks  
(up to 1 week later, or up to 3 days earlier)  after C1 of pembrolizumab  treatment date.  
In the event that there is a complete response after the first dose of study drug, and there is 
no surgical tissue available, the patient will have the option to continue with the study drug 
for up to one year, but will be considered non- evaluable and replaced for the study.  
If the resection surgery is delayed by [CONTACT_133618] 3 week  window (more  
than [ADDRESS_151258] dose of pembrolizumab), the patient may continue with surgery 
and pembrolizumab afterwards. Patients are expected to initiate adjuvant pembrolizumab 
within [ADDRESS_151259] or qualified designee to determine adequate surgical 
recovery before initiation of study drug. In the event of delays, there is no timeframe 
restriction in terms of when adjuvant pembrolizumab is initiated.  
Up to 12 months of pembrolizumab  are given every 3 weeks after C1 per the Trial Flow 
Chart, Section 6.0.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Post- Treatment Visits  
Subjects are evaluated within [ADDRESS_151260]. All AEs that occur prior to the Safety Follow -Up Visit should be recorded.  
Subjects with an AE of Grade > [ADDRESS_151261]. SAEs that 
occur wi thin 90 days of the end of treatment or before initiation of a new anti -cancer  
treatment should also b e followed and recorded.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Follow -up Visits  
Subjects will  move into the Follow -Up Phase after completing pembrolizumab  and should 
be assessed every 3 -6 mont hs by [CONTACT_133619]  (Section 6.0 -  
Trial Flow Chart ). Every effort should be made to collect information regarding disease 
status until the start of new anti -neoplastic therapy, disease progression, death, or end of 
the study . 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_151262] moves into the survival follow- up phase and should be contact[CONTACT_133620]# [ZIP_CODE]: Tissue Collection Study of Pembrolizumab in Advanced Melanoma  
 
Version Date: 06/18/[ADDRESS_151263].  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_151264] adequate tissue 
collected at either time point or who do not undergo surgery, are deemed unevaluable and 
will be re placed. If such patients received Pembrolizumab, then they will be evaluated in all 
safety analyses.  
[IP_ADDRESS].3  Definition of Time -to-event Outcomes  
Disease -free survival (DFS) is defined as the time from date of surgery to date of first 
documented disease progressio n, death due to any cause or last date that patient was 
documented to be disease -free (i.e., scan date). DFS is the prefe rred outcome because 
patients are rendered NED from surgery. Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from 
date of surgery to date of death due to any cause or last patient contact [CONTACT_133621]. Both DFS and 
OS outcomes will be measured from date of surgery, and not date of pre -surgery single 
dose Pembrolizumab, in order to compare DFS and OS estimates to published outcomes 
from other trials  in this population. Both DFS and OS will be estimated by [CONTACT_8761]- Meier 
method.  
7.[ADDRESS_151265] a causal relationship with this treatment. An adverse event can 
therefore be any unfavorable  and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a 
medicinal product or protocol -specified procedure, whether or not considered related to 
the medicinal product or protocol -specified procedure.  Any worsening (i.e., any clinically 
significant adverse change in frequency and/ or intensity) of a preexisting condition that is 
temporally associated with the use of the pembrolizumab , is also an adverse event.  
Adverse events may occur during the course of the use of [COMPANY_006] product in clinical trials or 
within the follow- up period specified by [CONTACT_760], or prescribed in clinical practice, from 
overdose (whether accidental or intentional), from abuse and from withdrawal.  
Adverse events may also occur in screened subjects during any pre -allocation baseline 
period as a result of a protocol -specified intervention, including washout or discontinuation 
of usual therapy, diet, placebo treatment or a procedure.  
All adverse events will be recorded from the time the consent form is signed through 30 
days following cessation of treatment and at each examination on the Adverse Event case

 report forms/worksheets.  The reporting timeframe for adverse events meeting any serious 
criteria is described in section 7.2. 1. 
Adverse events will not be collected for subjects during the pre -screening period (for 
determination of archival tissue status) as long as that subject has not undergone any 
protocol -specified procedure or intervention.  If the subject requires a blood draw, fresh 
tumor biopsy etc., the subject is first required to provide consent to  the main study and AEs 
will be captured according to guidelines for standard AE reporting.  
7.2.1  Applicable reporting to Abramson Cancer Center Data and Safety Monitoring 
Committee ( DSMC ) will occur as follows:  
On-Site subjects  (this includes any subjects enrolled at other sites on an in- house study)  
Every effort should be made to report an event as a diagnosis, not as a list of symptoms.

7.5 7.5  Events Requiring Prompt Reporting to the IRB including Unanticipated Problem 
Involving Risks to Subjects or Others Reporting Requirements  
Federal Regulation  21CFR §56.108(b)(1)  and 45 CFR 46.103(b)(5)  require the IRB to "follow 
written procedures for ensuring prompt reporting to the IRB…any unanticipated problems 
involving  risk to human subjects or others."    
In alignment with 21 CFR 312, investigators are required to promptly report to the IRB:  
 (1) Unanticipated problems including suspected adverse reactions and adverse reactions.  
UPCC# [ZIP_CODE]: Tissue Collection Study of Pembrolizumab in Advanced Melanoma  
 
Version Date: 06/18/201 8   40 
 • An event is considered a “suspected adver se reaction” when there is  reasonable 
possibility  that the drug/investigational product caused the adverse event.   For these 
reporting purposes,  reasonable possibility  means there is evidence to suggest a 
causal relationship between the drug/investigationa l product and the event.  
• For University of Pennsylvania IRB reporting, this means an event should be  
considered  probably  or definitely related to the research procedures.  
• An event is “unexpected” if it is not listed in the investigator’s brochure/package 
insert, or, is not listed at the specificity or severity that has previously been observed 
with the specific drug/investigational product; if an investigator’s brochure/package 
insert is not available, is not consistent with the risk information described in the 
general investigational plan.)  
• “Unexpected” also refers to events that are mentioned in the investigator’s 
brochure/package insert as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated, but, are 
not mentioned as to have been occurring (have been seen ) with the particular 
drug/investigational product under study.   
 (2) Unanticipated adverse device reaction. Any serious adverse effect on health or safety or 
any life -threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, 
problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence 
in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or application, or 
any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that re lates to the rights, 
safety, or welfare of subjects.  
• For drug/investigational product and device events, “serious” is defined as any 
death, life -threatening adverse event, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4967], a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial 
disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital 
anomaly/birth defect.   Other events that may be considered “serious” but not meet 
the prior criteria include: those events that may jeopard ize the patient or subject 
and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
noted above.  
 (3) In addition to unanticipated problems, the IRB also requires prompt reporting of the 
following events:  
• Complaint of a participant when the complaint indicates unexpected risks or the 
complaint cannot be resolved by [CONTACT_5051].  
• Violation or deviation (meaning an accidental or unintentional change to the IRB 
approved protocol) only when: one or more participants were placed at increased 
risk of harm, or, the event has the potential to occur again, the event represents 
serious or continuing noncompliance.

Version Date: 06/18/201 8   41 
  (4)  Breach of confidentiality.  
 (5) Incarceration of a participant when the research was not previously approved under 
Subpar t C and the investigator believes it is in the best interest of the subject to remain on 
the study.

7.6.1 7.6.1  Definition of an Overdose for This Protocol and Reporting of Overdose 
to the Sponsor and to [COMPANY_006] 
For purposes of this trial, an overdose is any dose higher than 20% over the prescribed dose  
for pembrolizumab . No specific information is available on the treatment of overdose of 
pembrolizumab .   Pembrolizumab should be discontinued and the subject shoul d be 
observed closely for signs of toxicity.  Appropriate supportive treatment should be provided 
if clinically indicated.  
If an adverse event(s)  is associated with (“results from”) the overdose of a [COMPANY_006]  product, 
the adverse event(s) is reported as a ser ious adverse event, even if no other seriousness 
criteria are met.  
If a dose of [COMPANY_006] ’s product meeting the protocol definition of overdose is taken without 
any associated clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory results, the overdose is reported 
as a non -serious Event of Clinical Interest (ECI), using the terminology “accidental or 
intentional overdose without adverse effect.”  
All reports of overdose with and without an adverse event must be reported within 24 
hours to the Sponsor -Investigator  and within 2 working days  hours to [COMPANY_006] Global Safety .

1.  A n overdose of [COMPANY_006] product, as defined in Section 7.2.[ADDRESS_151273] of protocol- specified laboratory testing or 
unscheduled laboratory testing.*  
*Note:   These criteria are based upon available regulatory guidance documents. The 
purpose of the criteria is to specify a threshold of abnormal hepatic tests that may 
require an additional evaluation for an underlying etiology.  
Subjects should be assessed for possible ECIs prior to each dose.  Lab results should be  
evaluated and subjects should be asked for signs and symptoms suggestive of a n immune -
related event.  Subjects who develop an ECI thought to be immune -related should have 
additional testing to rule out other etiologic causes.  If lab results or symptoms indicate a 
possible immune -related ECI, then additional testing should be perfo rmed to rule out other 
etiologic causes.  If no other cause is found, then it i s assumed to be immune -related.  
ECIs that occur in any subject from the date of first dose through 90 days following 
cessation of treatment, or the initiation of a new anticance r therapy, whichever is earlier, 
whether or not related to the [COMPANY_006]’s product, must be reported within 24 hours to the 
Sponsor -Investigator  and to [COMPANY_006] Global Safety within 2 working days.  
7.6.4 Evaluating Adverse Events  
An investigator who is a physician or qualified designee  will evaluate all adverse events 
according to the NCI Common Terminology for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0. Any 
adverse event which changes CTCAE grade over the course of a given epi[INVESTIGATOR_133603]/worksheets.  
All adverse events regardless of CTCAE grade must also be evaluated for seriousness.

 Is an overdose  (whether accidental or intentional).  Any adverse event associated with an overdose is considered a 
serious adverse event. An overdose that is not associated with an adverse event is considered a non- serious event 
of clinical interest and must be reported within [ADDRESS_151275] and may require medical or surgical interve ntion to prevent one of the outcomes

Version Date: 06/18/[ADDRESS_151277] cause the adverse event? The determination of the likelihood that the [COMPANY_006] product 
caused the adverse event will be provided by [CONTACT_19427] a physicia n or qualified designee . The 
investigator’s signed/dated initials on the source document or worksheet that supports the causality noted on the 
AE form, ensures that a medically qualified assessment of causality was done. This initialed document must be 
retained for the required regulatory time frame. The criteria below are intended as reference guidelines to assist 
the investigator in assessing the likelihood of a relationship between the test drug and the adverse event based 
upon the available information.  
The following components are to be used to assess the relationship between the [COMPANY_006] product and the AE ; the 
greater the correlation with the components and their respective elements (in number and/or intensity), the more 
likely the [COMPANY_006] product caused the adverse event (AE):  
 Exposure  Is there evidence that the subject was actually exposed to the [COMPANY_006] product such as: reliable 
history, acceptable compliance assessment (pi[INVESTIGATOR_692], diary, etc.), expected pharmacologic effect, 
or measurement of drug/metabolite in bodily specimen?  
 Time 
Course  Did the AE follow in a reasonable temporal sequence from admin istration of the [COMPANY_006] product?  
Is the time of onset of the AE compatible with a drug -induced effect (applies to trials with 
investigational med icinal product)?  
 Likely Cause  Is the AE not reasonably explained by [CONTACT_26369], other 
drug(s)/vaccine(s), or other host or environmental factors

Version Date: 06/18/[ADDRESS_151278] discontinued or dose/exposure/frequency  reduced?  
If yes, did the AE resolve or improve?  
If yes, this is a positive dechallenge. If no, this is a negative dechallenge.  
(Note: This criterion is not applicable if: (1) the AE resulted in death or permanent disability; (2) the 
AE resolved/improved d espi[INVESTIGATOR_130980]; or (3) the trial is a single -dose 
drug trial); or (4) [COMPANY_006] product(s) is/are only used one time.)

 7.6.5 Sponsor Responsibility for Reporting Adverse Events  
All Adverse Events will be reported to regulatory authorities, IRB and investigators in 
accordance with all applicab le global laws and regulations.  
8.0 8.0    STATISTICAL CO NSIDERATIONS 
 
8.1       Design 
This a single arm Phase 1b trial in patients with resectable advanced melanoma that will: 
1) establish the safety and feasibility of Pembrolizumab as adjuvant therapy and 2) 
investigate the immunologic effects of Pembrolizumab in tumor and peripheral blood. 
Patients will have tumor tissue collected at study entry, and then they receive one dose 
of Pembrolizumab prior surgical tumor resection. After surgery, patients receive 
adjuvant Pembrolizumab for up to one year, during which time serial blood samples will 
be taken.  
 
8.2      Objectives  
The primary objectives are to:  
1. Collect tumor tissue before and after a single dose of Pembrolizumab for explorat ory 
analyses of the  immunologic effects of Pembrolizumab and to generate testable and 
reasonable hypotheses. These analyses will examine immunologic components of tumor 
infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs).  
2.  Evaluate safety, tolerability and adverse events of P embrolizumab when given peri -
operatively and as adjuvant therapy.  
The secondary objectives are to: 
1. To examine the effects of Pembrolizumab on other immune regulatory pathways, from 
paired tumor tissue samples after treatment with a single dose of Pembroliz umab.  
 
2. To examine the effects of Pembrolizumab on immune biomarkers in PBMC and serum at 
serial time points during and after treatment with Pembrolizumab.  
 
3. To evaluate the disease -free-survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients receiving 
Pembrolizumab as adjuvant therapy.  
 
4. To describe the rate of recurrence and time to disease recurrence in patients receiving 
Pembrolizumab as adjuvant therapy.

 8.3       Endpoints  
Evaluability . A patient will be deemed evaluable for immune biomarker analysis if the 
patient received one pre -operative dose of Pembrolizumab and had adequate tissue 
collected at both baseline and tumor resection. Non- evaluable patients will be replaced.  
 
Toxicity.  CTCAE version 4.0 grades will be employed. Any patient who receives any 
amount of Pembrolizumab will be inc luded in the toxicity analysis.  
 
Immune biomarkers.  Priority assays will include: characterization of Tregs, CD8 T cells, 
exhausted T cells defined as  EomeshiPD1hi and Ki67 and Granzyme B in TILs. A full 
description of all immunologic outcomes and hypotheses is included in Section 7. 1.1.12.  
 
Disease -free and overall survival.  Disease -free survival (DFS) is defined as the time from 
date of surgery to date of first documented disease progression, death due to any cause 
or last date that patient was documented to be disease -free (i.e., a scan date). Overall 
survival (OS) is define d as the time from date of surgery to date of death due to any 
cause or last patient contact [CONTACT_133621]. Both DFS and OS outcomes will be measured from 
date of surgery to allow us to compare DFS and OS estimates with those of other 
adjuvant trials.  
8.4     Moni toring Toxicity  
The study will be terminated early if there is evidence that the rate of serious adverse 
events is greater than 33%. A serious adverse event is defined as any grade [ADDRESS_151279]-
surgery. Early termination rules are defined in Section 5.7 . 
8.5     Plans for Data Analysis  
Patient Evaluability.  Only evaluable patients will contribute to the primary analysis that 
characterizes the immunologic effects of Pembrolizumab in tumor tissue and secondary 
analyses on other immune regulatory pathways . All patients, regardless of time o n study 
and procurement of tissue, will contribute to the primary analysis of safety and to the 
secondary analyses of immunologic effects of Pembrolizumab in peripheral blood and of 
disease -free and overall survival.  
 
Toxicity: All observed adverse events which occur anytime from the initiation of study 
therapy to [ADDRESS_151280]-
surgery will be described separately.

Version Date: 06/18/201 8   51 
 Immune biomarkers:  Immunologic outcomes will be described using scatter and box 
plots and descriptive statistics (e.g., mean, median, SD, range). Pre -treatment to post-
treatment paired comparisons will employ paired Student’s t -test or Wilcoxon signed 
ranks test, as appropriate. With several post -treatment blood samples intended, trends 
over time will be described using scatter and box plots, descriptive statistics (e.g., fold 
changes from baseline). Comparisons of post -treatment values to the baseline value will 
be performed by [CONTACT_93739]. Longitudinal modeling using l inear mixed 
effects models will also be attempted, in order to extend this investigation to 
characterized trends over time and could include modeling jointly the inter -dependency 
among several longitudinally  measured immunologic outcomes.  
 
Disease -free and  overall survival:  will be estimated by [CONTACT_41238]. 
Median and 1 -year DFS and OS rates  and 95% CIs will be estimated.  
 
8.[ADDRESS_151281] 5% of enrolled 
patients will not be evaluable, we expect that no more than 32 patients will be enrolled.  
 
Primary objective: Treatment of 30 -32 patients will firmly establish the safety of the 
treatment. If the true underlying serious adverse rate is as low as 10%, then the failure 
to observe at least one adverse event in 32 treated patients, is <5% (binomial 
probability is 0.042). If the observed serious adverse event rate is 16.7% (5 of 30 
patients), then the true event rate is likely to be no higher than 30%, since the upper 
bound of the 2 -sided 95% confidence interval is 30%.  
 
Primary objective: For exploratory analyses of immunological effects of Pembrolizumab 
in tumor tissue, we anticipate conducting many paired comparisons. Due to multiple 
parameters tested, we will control the false positive rate by [CONTACT_133623] p 
values using  the Bonferroni -Holm method.  
 
We have estimated the detectable effect sizes for two of our immunologic endpoints, 
CD8/Treg ratio and Granzyme  B level using data on peripheral blood. In [ADDRESS_151282] 
deviation of paired differences (s d) was 15.90, yielding an effect size of 0.89s d. The 
mean pre - and maximum post -treatment CD8/Treg ratio in peripheral blood were 5.[ADDRESS_151283] deviation of paired differences (s d) was 8.61, 
yielding an effect size of 0.72s d. With 30 evaluable patients, there is 99% power to 
detect an effect size of 0.89s d and 96% power to detect an effect size of 0.72s d using a 
paired Student’s t -test at 2 -sided 5% error.  
 
These two endpoints were selected because they had the most dramatic post- treatment 
increases in peripheral blood. More heterogeneity and smaller effect sizes are possible 
in tissue. But we still have sufficient power to detect smaller effect sizes. For example, 
UPCC# [ZIP_CODE]: Tissue Collection Study of Pembrolizumab in Advanced Melanoma  
 
Version Date: 06/18/[ADDRESS_151284] size of 0.55s d can be detected with 82% power by a paire d t-test at 2 -sided 5% 
significance level.

Study Title :
A Randomized, Double- Blind, Controlled, Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Risk of Developi[INVESTIGATOR_734159], Including Neonates, Receiving Either Clinolipid (lipid 
injectable emulsion, USP) 20% or Standard -of-Care Soybean Oil -Based Lipid Emulsion
Study Number: 6344 -001
Study Phase: IV
Rationale:
Baxter plans to conduct a postmarketing ,randomized ,controlled clinical trial to evaluate the risk of 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_734160] (EFAD) in pediatric patients, including neonates, receiving 
either Clinolipid or standard -of-care soybean oil -based lipid emulsion.
Prim ary Objective:
To evaluate the risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_734161] , including neonates , receiving either 
Clinolipid or standard -of-care soybean oil -based lipid emulsion (Intralipid) as a component of parenteral 
nutrition (PN) w ithin the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_734162] 7 to 90 days, inclusive .
EFAD will be defined using the Holman Index (plasma triene: tetraene ratio , specifically 5,8,11 -
eicosatrienoic acid [mead acid ]to 5,8,11,14 eicosatetraenoic acid [arachidonic acid, ARA] ratio) value 
of >0.4.
1.Secondary Objective(s) :
2.The secondary objectives are as follows:
3.To evaluate the risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_734163], including parenteral nutrition -associated liver 
disease (PNA LD) as defined by [CONTACT_734193] ≥2mg/dL when no other etiology for liver 
dysfunction is present in patients receiving with intravenous lipid emulsion (ILE)
4.To evaluate the adequacy of nutritional intervention in patients receiving either ILE 
5.To evaluate the safety profiles of Clinolipid and Intralipid, as assessed by [CONTACT_20721] (AEs), 
serious adverse events (SAEs) and AEs of special interest (AESIs)

Clinical Trial Protocol #6344 -001: Amendment 5. 6 2022 FEB 22
Study Design :
This w ill be a descriptive study designed to evaluate the riskfor pediatric patients treated adequately 
with Clinolipid in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_132966] a maximum of 90days to develop EFAD.
Additionally, this study design w ill evaluate the safety and efficacy of using Clinolipid in a pediatric 
population .
A randomized, double- blind study is appropriate to decrease clinician and patient bias during study 
conduct.
Approximately 100 pediatric patients, including neonates, will participate in the study. Patients will be 
randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the treatment groups ( Clinolipid or Intralipid) according to a central 
dynamic randomization scheme stratified by [CONTACT_734194] (premature infants born <37 w eeks of 
gestation (up to 1 month corrected age [CA]), full -term neonates born ≥37 w eeks of gestation to <1 
month of age, infants 1 to <12 months of age, children 1 to <10 years of age, adolescent 10 to <18 years 
of age) .
The primary and secondary objectives will be determined based on, but not limited to, the following 
clinical and laboratory assessments: 
•Plasma fatty acid (FA) profiles and Holman Index;
•Genetic polymorphisms in the FA desaturase genes FADS1 and FADS2 in a subset of patients 
(approximately 20%) ;
•Hepatic function tests including alkaline phosphatase (ALP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 
alanine aminotransferase (ALT), gamma- glutamyl transferase (GGT), total and direct bilirubin to 
assess hepatic function and integrity ;
•Plasma phytosterol (stigmasterol, campesterol, and sitosterol), cho lesterol and squalene levels to 
determine potential correlation with the development of PNALD ;
•Holm an Index and fatty acid profiles will be evaluated. Select polymorphisms in the fatty acid 
desaturase genes, FADS1 and FADS2, will be determined in a subset of patients . The m ajor 
plasma phytosterols found in the lipid emulsions (stigmasterol, campesterol, and sitosterol ), 
cholesterol, and squalene also will be assessed.
After end of study treatment (maximum of 90 days), the patient will resume PN therapy as prescribed by 
[CONTACT_263235].

Statistical Methods:
Determination of Sample Size:
The sample size of 100 patients (50 in each of the 2 treatment groups: Clinolipid vs Intralipid), including 
neonates, is based on the feasibility of timely enrollment of patients for generating reference data and 
summary descriptive statistics, rather than on a formal power calculation.
Analysis Sets:
Theanalysis sets in this study include : the Full Analysis Set (FAS) ,the Per Protocol Set (PPS) , and the 
Safety Analysis Set . The FAS includes all patients who are randomized to receive either Clinolipid or 
standard -of-care (SOC) soy bean oil -based lipid emulsion (Intralipid), consistent with the intention -to-
treat principle. The PPS includes a subset of patients in the FAS who have Holman Index measurements 
taken at baseline and at least [ADDRESS_1003265] received a minimum of 7 days 

Clinolipid (lipid injectable emulsion, USP) 20% Page 6of 72
Clinical Trial Protocol #6344 -001: Amendment 5. [ADDRESS_1003266] received treatment (Clinolipid or SOC ).
Subgroup analyses of patients by [CONTACT_551] (prem ature infants born <37 w eeks of gestation (up to 1 
month CA ), full -term neonates born ≥37 w eeks of gestation <1 month of age, infants 1 to <12 months of 
age, children 1 to <10 years of age, adolescent 10 to <18 years of age) and subgroup analyses according 
togestational age and birth weight will be conducted .
The primary endpoint analysis and secondary endpoint analys esof the development of liver disease 
including parenteral nutrition -associated liver disease (PNA LD) and the adequacy of nutritional 
intervention will be conducted for both the FAS and PPS. The safety analyses (secondary endpoint no. 3) 
will be conducted for the FA S.
Primary Endpoint: 
The risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_734167] (determined by [CONTACT_734197] >0.4) in pediatric patients will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_734198] , Time to developi[INVESTIGATOR_734168] -Meier approach. Both incidence rate and proportion of EFAD will be 
computed for each treatment group.
Holm an Index also will be summarized w ith descriptive statistics (number of patients , mean, standard 
deviation, median, minimum, and maximum) on an approximately 15-daybasis in each of the 
2treatment groups (Clinolipid vs Intralipid).
FAprofiles will be summarized using descriptive statistics in each of the treatment groups.
FA profile, Holm an Index willbe assessed in the pediatric patients at baseline andapproximately every 
15 daysthroughout the stud yup to end of study treatment .
Genetic polymorphisms in the FA desaturase genes FADS1 and FADS2 will be assessed in a subset of 
patients (approximately 20%) and the distribution assessed in the context of the FAprofile.
•Genetic material will be obtained from buccal smears in all p atient s that consent to analysis of 
FADS1 and FADS 2 polymorphisms
•From  the subset of patient sconsenting to genetic analysis , the 10 patients (5 Intralipid and 5 
Clinolipid) w ith the lowest levels of ARA at any point during the study and the 10 patients (5 
Intralipid and 5 Clinolipid) with the highest levels of ARA at any point during the study will be 
selected for analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms within FADS 1 and FADS 2 genes as the 
synthesis of ARA from linoleic acid ( LA)requires both the de lta-5 and delta- 6 desaturase 
enzymes (coded for by [CONTACT_734199]1 and FADS 2).
•Distribution of the p olymorphisms within FADS1 and FADS 2 genes will be assessed in the 
context various FA findings as the synthesis of gamma -LA and ARAfrom LA (n-[ADDRESS_1003267]) and 
the synth esis of stearidonic acid, e icosapentaenoic acid (EPA )and docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA )
from ALA (n-[ADDRESS_1003268]) requir eboth the delta- 5 and delta- 6 desaturase enzymes (coded for by 
[CONTACT_734199]1 and FADS 2genes).
Secondary Endpoints:
The 3 secondary endpoints of the study include 1) the development of liver disease including PNA LD; 
2) the adequacy of nutritional intervention; and 3) the safety profiles including AEs, SAEs and AESIs.
1.Liver disease, including d evelopm ent of PNALD 
•The ri sk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_734169] (as defined by [CONTACT_734193] ≥2mg/dL when no other etiology 
for liver dysfunction is present in patients receiving ILE) in pediatric patients will be summarized
by [CONTACT_734198], as well as time to d evelopi[INVESTIGATOR_734170] -Meier approach. Both incidence rate and proportion of PNALD will be computed for each 
treatment group.
•To assess the relationship of phytosterol , cholesterol and squalene blood levels and the 
development of PNALD , plasma ph ytosterol, cholesterol, and squalene levels will be summarized 
using descriptive statistics at baseline ,at the end of study treatment , and as well as maximal 
values during the study period in each of the 2 treatment groups. In addition, the correlations 

Clinolipid (lipid injectable emulsion, USP) 20% Page 7of 72
Clinical Trial Protocol #6344 -001: Amendment 5. [ADDRESS_1003269] bilirubin will be assessed by [CONTACT_62252] a Pearson’s 
correlation coefficient or a Spearman correlation coefficient.
•Hepatic integrity (ALP, AST, ALT, GGT , total and direct bilirubin) will be evaluated by 
[CONTACT_734200] 2 treatment 
groups. Hepati c integrity parameters will also be summarized in shift tables comparing results 
from baseline to end of study treatment (max 90 days) and to maximal value during the study 
period in each of the 2 treatment groups. In addition, assessment for drug -induced liver injury will 
be conducted according to Hy’s Law and eDISH criteria.1,2
2.Adequacy of nutritional intervention 
The a dequacy of nutritional intervention in patients receiving either Clinolipid or Intralipid will be 
assessed and results analyzed as follows:
•Prescribed and actual nutritional intake s(calories , protein, lipi[INVESTIGATOR_734171] )from both 
PN and enteral/oral nutrition will be collected and recorded on a daily basis and summarized daily 
for the first 2 weeks of treatment andonan approximately every  15-daybasis afterwards up to the 
end of study treatment in each of the treatment groups.
•Grow th will be assessed and evaluated from baseline to end of study treatment on an 
approximately every 15-daybasis using descriptive summary statistics for weight, and
height/length (and head circumference in infant s<1 year)in each of the treatment group sas 
follows:
•Gain in weight (g/kg/day in infants andg/dayinchildren and adolescent s),and gain in 
length/height (mm /week in all) and head circumference (m m/weekin infants <1 year );
•Change s in the standard deviation score (SDS or z -score) from reference growth curves (Fenton 
grow th curve for premature infants, World Health Organization growth standards for infants and 
children ages 0 to 2 years, or Center for Disease Control grow th charts f or children age ≥2 years ).
3.Safety profiles of Clinolipid and Intralipid, including AEs, SAEs and AESIs .
The safety profiles will be assessed and analyzed as follows:
•Vital signs and laboratory tests will be summarized using descriptive summary statistics in each 
of the 2 treatment groups. 
•Additional neonatal morbidities including bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), retinopathy of 
prematurity (ROP), intraventricular hemo rrhage (IVH), periventricular leukomalacia (PVL), 
necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), and late- onset sepsis in enrolled premature infants born <37 
weeks of gestation up to 1 month CA .
•All AEs, SAEs, and AESI will be tabulated by [CONTACT_667237] (MedDRA) coded terms. 
•Adverse events and SAEs will be presented by [CONTACT_734201] s. In addition, the AE rate per 100 patient days will be reported.

carbon groups in carboh ydrates and proteins, they  lack the desaturase enzymes necessary  
to insert a cis double bond at the n- 6 and n- 3 position sof a FA. As a result , the parent

depi[INVESTIGATOR_371], poor wound healing, increased susceptibility  to infections, and poor 
growth in infants and children.3Biochemical characteristics include decreased blood and 
tissue PUFAs from the n -6 and n-3 series and an elevated triene:tetraene ratio ( T:T, 
Holman Index). Other biochemical manifestations of EFAD are considered non- specific 
and can include elevated liver enzy mes, h yperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], thrombocy topenia and altered 
platelet aggregation.3,[ADDRESS_1003281] y islimited .3,4Thus, EFAD primarily occur sin clinical 
circumstances that severely  limit fat intake, digestion, absorption and metabolism and in 
the sett ing of severely  depleted fat stores. Due to their high requirements and limited fat 
stores, y oung infants are at increased risk for EFA D, especiall y premature infants.4,5
Parenteral nutrition ( PN) is indicated for the supply  of energy  and essential nutrients 
when oral or enteral nutrition is not possible, insufficient, or contraindicated. Parenteral 
nutrition is essential for nutrient delivery  in patients with gastrointestinal (GI) 
dysfunction w ho lack the capacity  to absorb adequate nutrients for maintenance or 
recovery  of tissue mass and function. 
Intravenous lipid emulsions (ILEs) were developed in order to prevent and treat EFAD in 
patient swho require PN ,as well as to provide a high -densit y energy  source. The first 
intravenous fat preparation used to an y great extent in the [LOCATION_002] was made from 
cottonseed oil and marketed under the tradename [CONTACT_734241]® and was withdrawn from 
the market in 1965 because of numerous reports of toxicity , including "the fat -
overloading s yndrome", hemorrhagic tendencies, and liver damage. The toxic 
accumulation of fat observed with Lipomul was attributed to its large particle size (1 n m

in diameter), and possibly  the emulsify ing agent, pluronic F -68.6Subsequent ly,for 
several years PN did not include the provision of any  lipid and was associated with 
several reports of EFAD .7-[ADDRESS_1003282]-Lipomul ILEs were developed from so ybean oil (SO) or safflower oil, both rich 
in LA and ALA. SO contains about 45 –55 % LA, 6–9 % ALA, and very  little saturated or 
monounsaturated FAs. Intralipid, a 100% SO based ILE,was invented b y the Swedish 
physician and nutrition researcher Arvid Wretlind, and was approved for clinical use in 
Sweden in [ADDRESS_1003283] a negative influence on immunological functions, a ndmay
play a role in PN -associated liver disease (PNALD) . These findings were felt to be 
related to its absolute high PUFA content ,favoring lipid peroxidation, and the relative 
excess of n- 6 PUFAs ,favoring pro -inflammatory  effects.10,11
Several new ILEs were subsequently  developed includi ngother sources of FAs designed 
to decrease the proportion of SO. I n addition to the classic 100% SO ILEs, new 
generation composite ILEs contained other lipi[INVESTIGATOR_734173], olive oil (OO), or fish oil, or a 
combination of several sources. These new generation ILEs potentially  can provide 
advantages over pure SO ILEs and are widel y available in Europe and Canada but not in 
the [LOCATION_002].4,5,12- 14
Clinolipid is anILE compris ed of a mixture of 80% OO and 20% SO. Itwas formulated 
with a lower SO content than currently  marketed emulsions in order to reduce LA levels ,
while still providing an adequate amount of EFAs to prevent and correct EFAD in adult 
and pedi atric patients requiring PN.15This OO-based ILEis rich in oleic acid, an n -[ADDRESS_1003284] of the LA content of a 100% SO ILE ( fatty acid 
levels are provided in Table 1and sterol composition is provided in Table 2). This 
reduction in the EFA supply  could be a concern in a pediatric population , especially  
premature infants, who have higher EFA requirements than adults. Clinolipid has 
marketing authorization inapproximately [ADDRESS_1003285] that Clinolipid is safe and canprevent EFAD.15,16

2.STUDY OBJECTIVES
2.1Primary Objective
The primary  objective of this study  is to evaluate the risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_734175], including neonates, receiving either Clinolipid or SOC 100% SO -based 
ILE(Intralipid) as a component of PN within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_734162] 7 up to 90days.
Complete FA profile will be regularly  assessed and EFAD will be defined using a 
Holman Index (plasma triene :tetraene ratio , specifically 5,8,11 -eicosatrienoic acid [mead 
acid]to 5,8,11,14 eicosatetraenoic acid [arachidonic acid, ARA] ratio) value of >0.4 in 
the context of low L A, low ARA, and high eicosatrienoic acid.
Genetic pol ymorphisms in the   fatty acid desaturase 1 gene (FADS1) and fatty acid 
desaturase 2 gene (FADS2) will also be assesse din a subset of patients (approximately  
20%) and the distribution of the poly morphisms will be assessed in the context of the FA
profile as the s ynthesis of gamma -LA and ARA from L A (n-[ADDRESS_1003286] ) and the sy nthesis 
of stearidonic acid, e icosapentaenoic acid ( EPA )anddocosahexaenoic acid (DHA) from 
ALA (n -[ADDRESS_1003287] ) require both the delta -5 and delta -6 desaturase enzy mes (coded for 
by [CONTACT_734199]1 and FADS2 genes) .Genetic material will be obtained from buccal smears in 
all patients with consent to anal ysis of FADS1 and FADS2 poly morphisms. From the 
subset of patients consenting to genetic anal ysis, the 10 patients (5 Intralipid and 5 
Clinolipid) with the lowest levels of ARA at an y point during the stud y and the10 
patients (5 Intralipid and 5 Clinolipid) with the highest levels of ARA at any point during 
the study  will be selected for anal ysis of single nucleotide poly morphisms (SNPs) within 
FADS 1 and FADS2 genes.

2.2 Sec ondary Objective(s)
The secondary  objectives in patients receiving either Clinolipid or I ntralipid are to 
evaluate : 
•The risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_734176]:
-PNAL D will be defined by  [CONTACT_734193] ≥2mg/dL  when no other etiology  
for liver d ysfunction is present;
- H epatic integrit ywill be assessed by  [CONTACT_734202]: 
alkaline phosphatase (ALP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST ), alanine 
aminotransferase ( ALT), gamma- glutamy l transferase (GGT) ,andtotal and 
direct bilirubin;
- P lasma main phy tosterol s (stigmasterol, campesterol, sitosterol), cholesterol 
and squalene level swill be assessed. Ph ytosterols levels will be correlate d
with therisk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_734169].
•The adequacy  of nutritional interventions:
-Prescribed and actual nutritional intakes (energy , protein, carboh ydrates, and 
lipid) from both PN and enteral/oral nutrition will be collected and recorded 
on a daily  basis and summarized on a daily  basis during the first 2 weeks of 
treatment and on an approximately  15-day basis afterwards up to the end of 
study  treatment in each of the treatment groups. 
-Growth will be assessed and evaluated from baseline to end of study  treatment 
on an ap proximately  every  15-day basis using descriptive summary  statistics 
for weight, and height/length (and head circumference in infant <1 year) in 
each of the treatment groups as follows:
◦Gain in weight (g/kg/day in infants <1 y ear of age, g/day  in children a nd 
adolescents ) and gain in length/height (mm/week in all) and head 
circumference (m m/week in infants <1 y ear);
◦Changes in the standard deviation score (SDS or z- score) from reference 
growth curves (Fenton growth curve for premature infants, World Health 
Organization (WHO) growth standards for infants and children ages 0 to 
2years, or Center for Disease Control (CDC) growth charts for children 
age ≥2years).

3.INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN
3.1Overall Study Design and Plan
This is a multi- center, randomized, double -blind, controlled, safet y and efficacy  study  to 
evaluate the occurrence of EFAD (diagnosed b y Holman I ndex >0.4) in pediatric patients
receiving either Clinolipid or SOC SO-based ILE(Intralipid) in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_734162] 
7 up to 90 days as part of PN. The risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_734163], including PNALD 
(defined b y direct bilirubin ≥2mg/dL )when no other etiology  for liver dy sfunction is 
present, also will be assessed.
Approximately  100 pediatric patients, including neonates, will p articipate in the study .
Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the treatment groups ( Clinolipid or Intralipid) 
according to a central d ynamic randomization scheme stratified b y site and age group 
(premature infants born <37 weeks of gestation up to 1 month corrected age (CA), full -
term neonates born ≥37 weeks of gestation to <1 month of age, infants 1 to <12 months 
of age, children 1 to <10 years of age, adolescent 10 to <18 years of age ).In the case of 
multiple birth pregnancies , the infants will be assigned to the same treatment group.
Holman Index and FAprofile will be evaluated. Select pol ymorphisms in the FA
desaturase genes FADS1 and FADS2, will be determined in a subset of patients. The 
major plasma ph ytosterols found in the ILEs (stigmasterol, campesterol, sitosterol), 
cholesterol, and squalene will also be assessed.

Clinical Trial Protocol #6344 -001: Amendment 5. 6 2022 FEB 22
5.3 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Patient
Patients will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment groups (Clinolipid vs. I ntralipid). In case 
of multiple birth pregnancies , the infants will be assigned to the same treatment group. 
The selection of dose for each patient will be based on Table 4, Dosing Schedule for ILE
(Table 4) and PNguidelines for other macronutrients ( Table 3)as well as the patient’s 
age, weight, and medical condition as judged b y the investigator .
The admi nistration of PN with SOC ILE may  be initiated as per usual practice before 
Screening. In this situation, lipid dosing should be per Table 4, if possible.
If patients are not randomized on the same day  as Screening and SOC PN is initiated, 
patients should receive SOC ILE using the dosing schedule per Table 4, starting on Day  1 
of PN (until transition to study  drug). Once patients transition to study  drug, lipid dosing 
should continue progression per Table 4.
Study  treatment will be administered as pe r the SOC in each stud y site. Intravenous lipid 
emulsion infusion may  be administered over 20 to 24 hours daily , depending on hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8385].
Any significant deviat ion (more than 3 consecutive day s) to the Dosing Schedule and the 
reason for such violation should be recorded ( e.g.hypergly cemia, hy pertrigly ceridemia, 
higher energy  expenditure) in the case report form ( CRF ).
Parenteral nutrition therapy  may  be interrupted and restarted (based on the initial 
randomization) within a [ADDRESS_1003293] to adjudication from the medical 
monitor who conducts a clinical review of current patient status, assessment of any  
potential AE/SAEs, discussion/clarification with the investigator to resume or abort stud y 
treatment . If there is a likelihood that the patient will require a restart o fPN within 1 to 2 
days of the initial stoppage, then it is recommended to delay  performing the End of Study  
Treatment procedures. However, the End of Study Treatment procedures should be 
completed within 2 day s of the initial stoppage if the patient has not restarted PN
,as per 
Section 7.2.4 and Appendix 1 Schedule of Events.
5.4Method of Assigning Patient s to Treatment Groups
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_734194] (premature infants born <37 weeks 
of ge station up to 1 month CA , full -term neonates born ≥37 weeks of gestation to<1 
month of age, infants 1 to <12 months of age, children 1 to <10 years of a ge, adolescent 
10 to <18 y ears of age) in a 1:1 ratio to both treatment groups using a computer -generat ed 
central d ynamic randomization schedule .

(rs174553) and FADS2 (rs174575, rs99780, rs174583) will be collected from all enrolled 
patients for whom consent is obtained. Buccal swabs canbe collected at any  time before 
the end of stud y treatment.
From the subset of patients consenting to genetic analy sis, the 10 patients (5 Intralipid 
and 5 Clinolipid) with the lowest levels of ARA at any  point during the study and the 10 
patients (5 Intralipid and 5 Clinolipid) with the highest levels of ARA at any  point during 
the study  will be selected for anal ysis of SNPs within FADS 1 and FADS 2 genes asthe 
synthesis of ARA from LA requires both the delta- 5 and delta -6 desaturase enzy mes 
(coded for b y FADS1 and FADS 2) for s ynthesis.  The level of these desaturase enz ymes 
modulates the sy nthesis of ARA from LA.
Distribution of poly morphisms within FADS1 and FADS 2genes will be assessed in the 
context ofvarious FA sderived from EFAs (LA and ALA) : 
•Gamma -LAand ARA from the n-[ADDRESS_1003302] ;

Clinical Trial Protocol #6344 -001: Amendment 5. [ADDRESS_1003304] been completed.
6.8 Diagnosis and Management of Essential Fatty Acid Deficiency (EFAD)
EFAD will be suspected in all patients with abnormal plasma liver enzy mes tests or any  
clinical signs of EFAD. The diagnosis will be confirmed b y the planned FAprofile 
analyses(see Appendix 1 , Schedule of Events Table ).
The Holman Index will be used for the diagnosis and management of EFAD.
The Holman Index, also called plasma triene :tetraene (T:T) ratio, is the ratio of the level 
of eicosatrienoic acid (Mead acid , n-9 FA) and the level of ARA (n-6 FA).
6.8.1 Holman Index <0.2
Patients with a Holman Index of <0.[ADDRESS_1003305] the assessment for clinical features of 
EFAD (dermatitis, diarrhea, perianal irritation, growth and development failure, recurrent 
infections, irritability , and/or poor wound healing).
Second, it implies checking if the plasma ARA levels are within normal range and that 
the unblinded pharmacist preparing the ILE determine if L A intake is adequate (See
Section 6.8.5 Calculating L A Intake from ILE) .
•If no clinical features are present :
- If the ARA levels are within normal range with LA intake within the normal 
range (1 -4% of the total energy intake), continue to follow the patient and 
check FA levels and Holman I ndex regularl y (approximately  every  15 day s) 
till the Holman I ndex is normalized. The investigator and the patient may  
remain blinded.

Clinolipid (lipid injectable emulsion, USP) 20% Page 37of 72
Clinical Trial Protocol #6344 -001: Amendment 5. 6 2022 FEB 22
-If the ARA level is low , increase LA intake even if in the normal range (1-4% 
of total energy  intake) . For example, if the level of LA intake is less than 
normal requirement (<1% of total energy  intake), lipid intake will be 
increased to supply  LA within the normal range (1 -4 % of total energy  intake). 
If the patient is receiving a LA intake in the low normal range (1 -2% of 
energy intake), it needs to be increased >2% of energy  intake. If the patient is 
receiving a LA intake in the high normal range (3 -4% of energy  intake), it 
needs to be increased >4% o f energy  intake. The amount of the increase in L A 
intake should be determined by  [CONTACT_734217] y of increasing the lipid intake. The monitoring of LA 
and ARA levels Holman Index and clinical features will persist regularl y 
(every  15 day s) till the Holman I ndex is normalized.
•If there are clinical features, increase LA intake even if in the normal range. For 
example, if the level of LA intake is less than normal requirement (<1% of total 
energy  intak e), lipid intake will be increased to supply  LA within the normal 
range (1-4 % of total energy  intake). If the patient is receiving a LA intake in the 
low normal range (1 -2% of energy  intake), it needs to be increase d>2% of energy  
intake. If the patient is receiving a LA intake in the high normal range (3- 4%of 
energy  intake), it needs to be increase d>4% of energy  intake. The amount of the 
increase in LA intake should be determined b y the clinician considering the 
clinical state of the patient and the saf ety of increasing LAintake. The monitoring 
of LA and ARA levels ,Holman Index and clinical features will persist regularl y 
(approximately  every  15 day s) until the Holman Index is normalized and clinical 
features disappear .
6.8.3 Holman Index >0.4
Patients with Holman index >0.4 will be considered as biochemical EFAD. It will be 
confirmed in the context of low LA, low ARA, and high eicosatrienoic acid (Mead acid) .
Clinical EFAD is diagnosed in the presence of any clinical features of EFAD (dermatitis, 
diarrhea, perianal irritation, growth and development failure, recurrent infections, 
irritability , and/or poor wound healing).
The management of these patient s includes the assessment, the record, and the increase of 
LA intakes until the Holm an Index normalizes and clinical features, if present, disappear.  

Clinolipid (lipid injectable emulsion, USP) 20% Page 38of 72
Clinical Trial Protocol #6344 -001: Amendment 5. [ADDRESS_1003306] until the Holman I ndex normalize s
and clinical features disappear . If the Holman Index does not reduce to <0.[ADDRESS_1003307] higher requirements for EFAs due to an underl ying disease (e .g. 
high demand for growth and wound healing). Total parenteral lipid intake should usually  
remain below the maximum intake ( Table 4, Dosing Schedule ), which is an amount that 
is normally  adequate for prevention of EFAD in all patients. The patient should receive 
the increased LAintake for at least 1 week prior to repeating the FA profile with the 
Holman Index assessments to allow time for the phy siologic effects of the FAto occur.
When EFAD persists despi[INVESTIGATOR_734184], the ILE should be unblinded. If the 
patient is re ceiving Clinolipid, the patient should be switched to Intralipid to allow for 
greater delivery  of LA.
Additional LAintakes may  be supplied viaintravenous and/or enteral/ oral routes.
If severe hy pertrigly ceridemia (trigly cerides >400 mg/dL) develops, the cause should be 
investigated. If it is determined to be related to the ILE , lipid intake may  be adjusted 
using the ILE with the higher relative content of LA.
If direct bilirubin increases above 2.5 mg/dL suggestive of cholestasis, a reduction of 
total lip id intake may be considered while continuing to provide adequate LA.The 
adequacy  of LA intake needs to be confirmed by [CONTACT_93305] (s).
6.8.4 Holman Index >0.4 at baseline
Some study  patients (especiall y premature infants) may demonstrate FA profile and 
Holman index compatible with EFAD at baseline due to their limited fat stores. The 
treatment for these infants is to administer EFA via ILEas part of their PN as described 
in Table 4, Dosing Schedule and being sure to reach the maintenance dosage . Infants with 
EFAD at baseline are to be followed regularl y (approximately  every  15 day s) while 
receiving ILEper stud y protocol for improvement in their FA profile and Holman I ndex .  
•If the Holman Index does not decrease with lipid administration in accordance 
with Table 4, Dosing Schedule , the patient may  have greater than normal 

Clinolipid (lipid injectable emulsion, USP) 20% Page 39of 72
Clinical Trial Protocol #6344 -001: Amendment 5. 6 2022 FEB 22
requirements for EFA and the LA intake should be increased to the maximum 
dosage according to Table 4, Dosing Schedule and at the investigator’s discretion.
•If the patient still does not respond, the invest igator will be unblinded to 
determine if the patient is receiving Clinolipid or Intralipid . If the patient is 
receiving Clinolipid, the patient should be switched to Intralipid (as Intralipid 
contains a higher concentration of LAthan Clinolipid) .
•If the patient does not respond to I ntralipid at maximal lipid dosage , consider 
increasing the LA intake with an enteral/oral source of LA or some additional 
intravenous Intralipid intakes.
6.8.5 Calculating Linoleic Acid (LA) Intake from Intravenous Lipid Emulsion (ILE)
Clinolipid contains approximately  18.6% LAwhile Intralipid contains approximately  
54.7% LA. Since both are 20% ILE(20g/dL, 0.2 g/mL, 2 kcal/ml), the content of LA is 
approximately  0.11 g/mL for Intralipid (1.1 kcal/ml from LA) and 0.04 g/mL for 
Clinolipid (0.4 kcal/ml from L A) (Table 6).
Table 6. Intralipid and Clinolipid Linoleic Acid Content
Content 20% Intralipid 20% Clinolipid
Lipid, g/ml 0.2 0.2
Energy, kcal/ml 2 2
Linoleic acid, g/ml 0.11 0.04
Linoleic acid, kcal/ml 1.1 0.4
Sample Calculation:
If a 2 kg patient receives 16mL of Intralipid per day, the patient receives 8 ml/kg/day  of 
Intralipid. I t corresponds to 1.6 g/kg/day of lipid and 0.88 g/kg/day  of LA. The energy  
partof LA is 8.8 kcal/kg/day . If the total energy  intake is 100 kcal/k g/day , it means that 
8.8% of the energy  intake c omesfrom LA.
If a 2 kg patient receives 16mL of Clinolipid per day , the patien treceives 8 ml/kg/day  of 
Clinolipid. I t corresponds to 1.6 g/kg/day  of lipid and 0.32 g/kg/day  of LA. The energy  
part of LA is 3.2 kcal/kg/day . If the total en ergy intake is 100 kcal/kg/day , it means that 
3.2% of theenergy  intake comes from LA.

Clinolipid (lipid injectable emulsion, USP) 20% Page 40of 72
Clinical Trial Protocol #6344 -001: Amendment 5. 6 2022 FEB 22
The LA intake that normally  prevents EFAD is 1 -4% of total energy  intake. The 
unblinded pharmacist determines if the patient has adequate LA intake for prevention of 
EFAD . The pharmacist communicate sto the patient’s nutrition clinician according to the 
protocol ( see Sections 6.8.2, 6.8.3 and 6.8.4 .).
6.9Nutritional Intake
Prescribed and actual macronutrient intake (fluid, energy , protein, carboh ydrates, and 
lipid) of both parenteral and enteral nutrition will be col lected and recorded on a daily  
basis in the CRF from Baseline to end of study  treatment for each of the treatment 
groups .See Appendix 1 , Schedule of Events Table, for additional details .
Intravenous intakes (fluid, amino acid, dextrose/glucose, and lipid) from PN as well as 
any intravenous macronutrient addition sto the PN solution will be collected and recorded
as parenteral intakes.
For breast milk intake, the macronutrient content will be estimated from volume intake s
using mean reference values in mature human milk (640 kcal, 12 g of protein, 67 g of 
carboh ydrates, and 34 g of lipid per1 Literof milk ).23When breastfeeding intakes cannot 
be measured, the best estimation (volume) of the investigator will be recorded. For 
commercial products including formula and human milk fortifiers, macronutrient intakes
will be recorded from volume intake and calculated from manufacturer label. For oral 
food ingestion , energy  and lipid intakes only  will be recorded from best estimates.
6.10 Dispensing Study Treatment
Blinded study  treatment will be provided to the pediatric /neonatal unit from the study  site 
pharmac ist(s) . The pharmac ist(s) will maintain accurate and complete records of study  
treatment dispensation. Study  personnel in the pediatric /neonatal unit will administer

pump, as appropriate for the volume dispensed .
The amount of lipid emulsion (g/kg/day ) delivered to the patient will be collected dail y 
and recorded (volume, flow rate and infusion duration) for each administration of study  
treatment (See Section 6.9).
6.11 Concomitant Medications
Ongoing medications and nutritional supplements received by  [CONTACT_734218] (if applicable) will be recorded as concomitant medication once study  treatment 
has been initiated. During treatment, concomitant medications and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (including 

Clinolipid (lipid injectable emulsion, USP) 20% Page 41of 72
Clinical Trial Protocol #6344 -001: Amendment 5. 6 2022 FEB 22
dose, frequency , start and stop dates, and indication for use ), will be recorded in the CRF
by [CONTACT_734219] a daily  basis .
During treatment, both patien ts’ and nursing mothers’ concomitant medications (as 
documented in the patient’s chart) will be recorded.
6.[ADDRESS_1003308] be documented in the 
eCRF:
•Chest tube
•Surgical procedure
•Surgical central line placement
•Blood/platelet/fresh frozen plasma or other colloid infusion
•Pericardiocentesis, pleural or peritoneal tap
•Lumbar puncture
6.[ADDRESS_1003309] a causal relationship 
with the treatment or drug. An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable and unintended sign
(including an abnormal laboratory  function), s ymptom (e.g., rash, pain, discomfort, fever, 
dizziness, etc.), organ d ysfunction (e.g., cardiovascular failure, pancreatitis, etc.), 
systemic illness (e.g., sepsis), or outcome of death temporally  associated w ith the use of 
the study  product, whether or not the event is considered associated with the study  
product.
Laboratory  and vital sign abnormalities qualify  as AEs if medical intervention is required 
to treat or address the abnormality , if the patient must be discontinued from the study  due 
to the abnormality , or if the value exceeds specific limits defined by  [CONTACT_734220].
An elective procedure/surgery  that occurs during the course of a study , but is being 
performed for a documented pre -existing condition and was pre -planned prior to study  
entry ,will not qualify  as an AE. If, however, the pre -existing condition unexpectedly  
deteriorates during the study  requiring the procedure/surgery  to be performed earlier than 

Clinolipid (lipid injectable emulsion, USP) 20% Page 42of 72
Clinical Trial Protocol #6344 -001: Amendment 5. 6 2022 FEB 22
planned, the condition for which the procedure/surgery  is being performed will qualify  as 
an AE.
In this stud y, AEs will be recorded in conjunction with the first study procedure
(Screening) . Adverse events occurring prior to the initiation of the first study  procedure
will be r ecorded as signs and sy mptoms in the patient’s medical history . Adverse events 
occurring during Screening but prior to the administration of study  treatment will be 
considered as unrelated to study  treatment.
6.13.[ADDRESS_1003310] dose of study  drug, if 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_734185], the Investigator or designee will routinely  monitor
and solicit each patient for the occurrence of an y AEs. If an AE occurs, a full description 
of the event, including the date and time of onset, duration, severit y, actions taken, 
outcome, seriousness of the event, and causal relationship of the AE to the study  
treatm ent will be recorded in the patient’s CRF. All AEs will be followed by  [CONTACT_734221], stabilized, or returned to baseline.
6.13.2 Severity
The severit y of an AE is defined as a qualitative assessment by  [CONTACT_734222]. The assessment of 
severit y will be made irrespective of treatment relationship or seriousness .
The severit y of each AE will be recorded as mild, moderate, or severe according to the 
following definitions:
•Mild – The AE is a transient discomfort and does not interfere in a significant 
manner with the patient’s normal functioning level and/or the AE resolves 
spontaneously  or may  require minimal therapeutic intervention.
•Moderate –The AE produces limited impairment of function and may  require 
therapeutic intervention and/or the AE produces no sequela/sequelae.
•Severe –The AE results in a marked impairment of function and may  lead to 
temporary  inability  to resume usual life pattern and/or the AE produces 
sequela/sequelae, which require (prolonged) therapeutic intervention.

Clinical Trial Protocol #6344 -001: Amendment 5. [ADDRESS_1003311]/control is etiologically  related to/associated with the AE. 
Causality  assessment includes, for example, assessment of temporal relationships, 
dechallenge/rechallenge information, association (or lack of association) with underly ing 
disease, presence (or absence) of a more likely  cause, and phy siologic plausibil ityFor 
each AE, the investigator will assess the causal relationship between the investigational 
product (IP) /control and the AE using his/her clinical expertise and judgment according 
to the following most appropriate algorithm for the circumstances of the AE:
•Not related (both circumstances must be met). 
a.Is due to underl ying or concurrent illness, complications, concurrent treatments, 
or effects of concurrent drugs. 
b.Is not associated with the I P/control (i. e., does not follow a reasonable temporal 
relationship to the administration of I P/control or has a much more likel y 
alternative aetiology ).
•Unlikely  related (either 1 or both circumstances are met).
a.Has little or no temporal relationship to the I P/control.
b.A more likely  alternative aetiology  exis ts.
•Possibly  related (both circumstances must be met). 
a.Follows a reasonable temporal relationship to the administration of I P/control. 
b.An alternative aetiology  is equally  or less likely  compared to the potential 
relationship to the I P/control.
•Probably  related (both circumstances must be met). 
a.Follows a strong temporal relationship to the administration of I P/control, 
which may  include but i s not limited to the following:
1.Reappearance of a similar reaction upon re -administration (positive 
re-challenge).
2. Positive results in a drug sens itivity  test (skin test, etc.).
3.Toxic level of the I P/control as evidenced by  [CONTACT_667232]/control concentrations in the blood or other bodily  fluid.
b.Another aetiology  is unlikely  or significantly  less likely .

6.13.7 Serious Adverse Events
[IP_ADDRESS] Definition
A SAE is defined b y federal regulation as any AE occurring at any  dose that results in 
any of the following ou tcomes: death, life -threatening , inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8448], p ersistent or significant disability /incapacity  or 
congenital anomal y/birth defect.
Important medical events that may  not result in death, be life threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10154], based upon appropriate medical 
judgement, they  may  jeopardize the patient and may  require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such 
medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an 
emergency  room or at home, blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency  or drug abuse.
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting Serious Adverse Events
All SAEs or any  pregnancy  reports with or without an associated SAE must be re ported 
to the sponsor within 24 hours of site's knowledge of the event. Further details are 
specified in the Safety  Management Plan.
The Investigator will also report an y SAEs to the Institutional Review Board (IRB) in 
writing based on the IRB’s reporting requirements and provide the Sponsor with a cop y 
of the notification.

Clinical Trial Protocol #6344 -001: Amendment 5. [ADDRESS_1003313] be reported to Baxter Global 
Pharmacovigilan ce.
Baxter or designee will assess each SAE reported by  [CONTACT_87715]. Expedited reports 
will be submitted to the appropriate Authorit y by [CONTACT_87714]. Per regulations, 
Investigators will receive a letter from Baxter or designee describing the expedited SAE. 
The Investigator should file this letter within their Investigator Site File. Additionally , the 
Expedited Report letter may  need to be submitted by  [CONTACT_941] I nvestigator to their I RB, as 
appropriate per local regulations.
6.13.8 Treatment -Emergent Adverse Events
A treatment -emergent AE is defined as an y AE that occurs after the onset of study  
treatment administration through the end of the study .
6.14 Removal of Patient s from the Study / Discontinuation of the Study
Any patient/legal representative may  voluntarily  withdraw consent for continued 
participation and data collection at an y time during the course of the study. The 
Investigator may  terminate a patient’s study  participation at any  time during the study  if 
the Investigator judges it to be in the patient ’s best interest.
Patient s may  be withdrawn or prematurel y discontinued from the study
treatment/assessments for an y of the following reasons:
•Adverse Event(s)
•Clinically  significant change in a laboratory  parameter
•Protocol violation ( i.e. patient failed to meet protocol entry criteria or did not 
adhere to the protocol requirements)
•Pregnancy
•Patient or any legal representative requests to withdraw from the study
•Sponsor or Investigator terminates the study
All patients randomized to Clinolipid who must receive Intralipid for rescue therap y 
purposes will be discontinued from the trial.

Clinolipid (lipid injectable emulsion, USP) 20% Page 46of 72
Clinical Trial Protocol #6344 -001: Amendment 5. 6 2022 FEB 22
Parenteral nutrition therapy  may  be interrupted and restarted (based on the initial 
randomization) within a [ADDRESS_1003314] to adjudication from the medical 
monitor who conducts a clinical review of current patient status, assessment of any  
potential AE/SAEs, discussion/clarification with the investigator to resume or a bort study  
treatment . The outcome of the adjudication process will not preclude the monitoring for 
AE/SAEs for the subsequent [ADDRESS_1003315] returns to baseline. If there is a likelihood 
that the patient will require restart of PN within 1 to 2 day sof the initial stoppage, then it 
is recommended to delay performing the End of Study  Treatment procedures. However, 
the End of Study  Treatment procedures should be completed within 2 days ofthe initial 
stoppage if the patient has not restarted PN,as per Section 7.2.4 and Appendix 1
Schedule of Events.
If a patient ’s participation is discontinued, the reason(s) must be recorded in the source 
documents and in the CRF.
End of study  treatment procedures should be performed when a patient withdraws or is 
discontinued from the study .
Patients who are withdrawn from the stud y will not be replaced.
The study  may  be discontinued:
•If new safet y information becomes available indicating that continuing the study  
treatment or procedures may  jeopar dize the safety  of the patients
•Because of an administrative decision by  [CONTACT_1034]
6.15 Appropriateness of Measurements
Measurements to be performed during the course of the study (with the following 
exceptions) are standard for the indication or patient popu lation under study: testing for 
phytosterols andgenetic poly morphisms, while not standard, are appropriate for 
addressing the stud y endpoints.

9.PLANNED STATISTICAL METHODS
9.1General Consid erations
A more detailed description of the statistical anal ysis will be presented in the Statistical 
Analy sis Plan (SAP) .
9.2Determination of Sample Size
The sample size of 100 patients (50 in each of the 2 treatment groups: Clinolipid vs 
Intralipid), including neonates, is based on the feasibility  of timel y enrollment of patients 
for generating reference data and summary  descriptive statistics, rather than on a formal 
power calculation.
For those patients who are discontinued from PN prior to 7 day s due to adequate oral or 
enteral nutrition may  be replaced at the discretion of the Sponsor.
9.3Analysis Populations 
Theanalysis sets in this study include : the Full Analy sis Set (FAS) ,the Per Protocol Set 
(PPS) , and the Safet y Analysis Set . The FAS includes all patients who are randomized to 
receive either Clinolipid or SOC SO-based lipid emulsion (I ntralipid), consistent with the 
intention -to-treat principle. The PPS includes a subset of patients in the FAS who have 
Holman Index measuremen ts taken at baseline and at least [ADDRESS_1003324] received a minimum of 7 day s of ILE treatment, and are without a 
major protocol violation (i.e. violation that potentially  impacts the primary  endpoint). The 
Safety  Anal ysis Set i ncludes all patients that have received treatment (Clinolipid or 
SOC ).
Subgroup anal yses of patients by  [CONTACT_551] (e .g.,premature infants born <37 weeks of 
gestation up to 1 month CA , full -term neonates born ≥37 weeks of gestation <1 month of 
age, infants 1 to <12 months of age, children 1 to <10 y ears of a ge, adolescent 10 to <18

conducted .
The primary  endpoint analy sis and secondary  endpoint analy ses of liver disease includin g 
parenteral nutrition -associated liver disease (PNA LD) and the adequacy  of nutritional 
intervention will be conducted for both the FAS and PPS. All safety  anal yses will be 
conducted on the Safet y Analy sis Set .
Infants found to subsequently  have baseline E FAD will not be considered to have 
treatment emergent EFAD and will be anal yzed separately  from infants with normal 
baseline EFAD status. Unblinded infants will be analy zed separately  as well.

Plasma phy tosterol , cholesterol, and squalene levels will be summarized using descriptive 
statistics (mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum) at baseline and 
the end of stud y treatment , aswell as maximal value during the study and the delay  
(days) between stud y baseline and maximal value in each of the 2 treatment groups 
(Clinolipid vs I ntralipid). In addition, the correlations between plasma ph ytosterol levels 
and direct bilirubin value swill be assessed b y computing a Pearson’s correlation 
coefficient or a Spearman correlation coefficient depending on whether the normality  
assumption is fulfilled.

syndrome (focal seizures, fever, leukocy tosis, hepatomegal y, splenomegal y and shock) .
In addition, the AE rate will be estimated using p erson time (person -day) as the 
denominator, which is computed as “total number of patients” times “treatment exposure 
period [day ]” in the corresponding treatment group. The AE rate per 100 patient day s will 
be reported for the overall study  period, and ma y be stratified into Weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4 as 
appropriate.

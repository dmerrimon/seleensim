 Page 8 of 38 Template Revised On : 6/25/[ADDRESS_346621] will evaluate a  novel adaption of the Senior Companion Program 
(SCP) administered by [CONTACT_283760]’ Alzheimer’s disease or related dementias (ADRDs); 
identify and facilitate use of community -based lo ng-term services and supports 
(LTSS); and improve engagement with healthcare providers. This intervention, 
called the PorchLight Project  has the following aims:   
Specific Aim 1. Implement PorchLight Project  for [ADDRESS_346622] or 
memory concerns  (collectively, persons with memory loss [PWML])  and/or their 
caregivers in one urban and rural region of Minnesota. A convergent parallel 
mixed methods design [(QUAN+QUAL) -->QUAL] will be utilized to examine the 
feasibility, acceptability, and utility of Porch Light Project  for 25 families and their 
SC-Ds (n = 20) over a 3 -month period (i.e., Stage I of the NIH Stage Model).  
 
Specific Aim 2. Refine PorchLight Project  delivery and implementation for 
efficacy evaluation. Activities to support this aim will include  assessment of R61 
milestones and incorporation of R61 findings to refine the PorchLight Project  
prior to efficacy evaluation. Through stakeholder engagement with the Dementia 
Healthcare Research Advisory Group (DHR) as well as analysis of the various 
quan titative and qualitative data elements collected during this Phase, we will 
finalize and refine effective training approaches for PorchLight Project  Senior 
Companions (SC s), identify and confirm stakeholder -centric measures, and 
enhance the overall impleme ntation of the PorchLight Project  to inform a 
subsequent R33 Phase.  
 
2.0 Background  
The public health implications of Alzheimer’s disease or related dementias 
(ADRDs) are significant. Approximately 10% of Americans over the age of [ADDRESS_346623], with this perce ntage escalating to 32% for those over the age of 
85.(1) The multi -year progression of ADRD has placed considerable pressure on 
the U.S. healthcare s ystem, as persons with ADRD account for considerably 
higher healthcare costs than individuals without ADRD. (1-3) These concerns have 
led some to ask: how are we going to live with ADRD? (4, 5)  
 
Public health efforts to address ADRD are limited. The inability of formal 
healthcare systems to effectively identify ADRD and the lack  of suitable care or 
case management often result in families remaining unaware of important 
community -based, long -term services and supports (LTSS) that could help to 
mitigate the negative effects of ADRD. (6, 7)  Approaches that: a) identify 
community -residing older persons with potential memory impairment; b) assist 
their families in navigating the healthcare system; and c) facilitate the 
identification of appropriate community -based LTSS could result in more 
effective management of ADRD. (4, 8 -10) 
PROTOCOL TITLE: Utilizing Senior Companions to Enhance Deme ntia Care

VERSION DATE: 10/28/22; IRB Approved 11/1/22  
 Page 9 of 38 Template Revised On : 6/25/2018   
Funded by [CONTACT_283761], The Senior 
Companion Program (SCP) is one of three National Senior Service Corps 
programs. The SCP places volunteers in the homes of frail older adults to serve 
as companions, to provide assistance with activities of daily living, and to provi de 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_135975]. (11-14) The SCP features 12,190 Senior Companions 
serving 43,000 frail older clients and 6,650 families throughout the U.S. in 
2017. (15) Although several efforts have attempted to utilize the SCP  to develop 
psychoeducational, multi -session interventions for dementia family caregivers in 
smaller scale studies, (16) the use of SCP as a possible public health intervention 
to engage PWML , identify LTSS in the community, and facilitate healthcare 
system interactions is heretofore untapped. Utilization of lay/peer intervention 
providers in the community to reach older persons and their families who 
struggle with memory loss or ADR D may offer a novel, cost efficient method to 
reach those in need. Such an approach may also serve as a fulcrum around which 
formal healthcare delivery and community -based LTSS are better integrated for 
PWML  and their families, which is a core tenet of eff ective chronic disease 
care. (17, 18)

4.0 Study Intervention(s)/Interaction(s)  
 
Study Intervention  
Senior Com panions (or other LSS -MN volunteers providing senior companionship 
services) who deliver the PorchLight Project  will first complete the CARES® 
Dementia Care Specialist training modules developed by [CONTACT_283764]. 
The CARES® interactive modules are  designed to provide education, tools, and 
resources to help professionals from various disciplines as well as families 
provide more person -centered, effective care across the spectrum of ADRD. The 
CARES® modules are developed specifically for those with l ower health literacy. 
The CARES® Approach is based on the following principles: C – Connect with the 
Person, A – Assess Behavior, R – Respond Appropriately, E – Evaluate What 
Works, and S – Share with Others. Among the unique and helpful features of the 
CARES® modules are care scenarios with real professionals, family members, and 
persons with ADRD as well as a wide variety of textual, audio, and visual 
resources, passive and active learning modes, interviews in streaming video, and 
resources for interactiv e feedback and interpersonal follow up. (19-24) Research 
supported by a series of Small Business Innovation Research grants authored by 
[CONTACT_283765] (John Hobday) and the PI 
(Joseph E. Gaugler, PhD) have demonstrated these modules’ strong feasibility, 
utility, and potential to inform practice change among diverse users. (19-24) 
Many states that require dementia -specific training for long -term care providers 
PROTOCOL TITLE: Utilizing Senior Companions to Enhance Deme ntia Care 
Services and Supports : R61 Phase  
VERSION DATE: 10/28/22; IRB Approved 11/1/22  
 Page 11 of 38 Template Revised On : 6/25/2018  recognize completion of the CARES® De mentia Basics module alone as a 
necessary training requirement. The Alzheimer’s Association also offers the 
CARES® modules as its essentiALZ® training certification program.  
 
Volunteer  companions who deliver the PorchLight Project,  as well as their 
Regiona l Program Coordinator (RPCs) , will complete  the first three modules of  
the CARES® program  (Dementia Basics; Dementia -Related Behavior; Dementia 
Care for Families) . Completion of the CARES® modules are self -paced, and can be 
completed individually or in a g roup setting. We will provide 20 tablets as 
needed to facilitate SCs’ training.   
 
In addition to the CARES training, SCs will be asked to complete four additional 
trainings provided by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Gaugler’s team that will cover the following topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102]: 1) 
overview of  the PorchLight Program, recruitment and approach, 2) Review of the 
National Consensus Guidelines on Palliative Care, (25) 3) Review of the list of 
guided questions, and 4) Review of journaling approach and LTSS resources. The 
National Consensus Guidelines on Palliative Care are evidence -based 
recommendations to provide a holistic palliative care m odel. For the purpose of 
our project, these guidelines will be adapted for the lay person delivering care 
(SCs). SCs will participate in these training sessions either in person or via web 
and/or teleconference. These sessions will offer the opportunity to  integrate and 
demonstrate the learning obtained in the CARES® modules.  CARES ® reminders, 
resources, tips, and slides used for this training, along with space for note -taking, 
are provided in a binder and/or bag with the project logo. As needed, additional 
resources are given on request.  
 
After completing these trainings  and passing  a knowledge check  exam (a score of 
90% or greater; the exam can be retaken at no additional cost if needed) , SCs will 
receive a certificate of “CARES ® Memory Support Specialist” (CMSS) . 
 
The 3rd component of the PorchLight Project  training will include mo nthly check -
ins (discussions and case review as applicable)  with Senior Companions and  the 
University of Minnesota (UMN) research team (the Principal Investigator/PI, 
research coordinator, or research assistant)  via phone and/or in person . (26-
29)SCs who deliver the PorchLight Project  will also be trained to identify 
community -based LTSS.  A particular emphasis of SC engagement is to identify 
the strengths and needs of the PWML  as well as their family caregiving system 
via semi -structured guides that assess elicit preferences for physical, family, 
social, cultural, financial/legal , and  spi[INVESTIGATOR_60408]. (28)  
 
Monthly check -ins will largely focus on review of specific cases  (as applicable) , 
discussion of challenges and potential solutions, provision of additional 
education as needed, and ensuring that SCs are regularly engaged with PWML

successfully utilized this approach in a current national pragmatic trial that 
implements a staff -delivered family care management program in adult day 
service programs (“ADS Plus,” R01 AG049692; PIs: G itlin and Gaugler) . 
 
A project “checklist” will be available  to enrolled companions as needed (offered 
during training or at monthly check in sessions) to facilitate completion of 
project training and the process for sharing information with their clients.  
  
5.0 Procedures Involved  
 
A parallel convergent mixed methods design [(QUAN+QUAL) -->QUAL] will be 
used to generate qualitative and quantitative data on the feasibility and utility of 
the PorchLight Project  across two Senior Companion Program (SCP) regions 
served by [CONTACT_283766] (LSS -MN) (Stage I of the NIH 
Stage Model). The R61 procedure will begin with the project biostatistician, [CONTACT_283803], randomly assigning the 12 RPCs to one of t wo groups: a PorchLight Project  
“treatment” region or a SCP usual care region. A re -randomization procedure will 
be used to ensure balance between Regional Program Coordinators (RPCs) who 
are assigned to intervention or control conditions on 3 important re gional/RPC -
level covariates: 1) whether the RPC has oversight within the Minneapolis -
St.Paul 7 -county region; 2) whether the region includes 20 or more SCPs; and 3) 
whether the RPC has 3 or more years of experience in this position. The re -
randomization pr ocedure has been used successfully in our ongoing ADS Plus 
trial (R01 AG049692). It involves conducting multiple possible randomizations 
(e.g. 20) before the trial is initiated, then selecting the one randomization 
assignment solution that achieves optimal  balance on these pre -specified 
covariates. Two of the RPCs randomly assigned to a PorchLight Project  treatment 
region will be randomly selected again to initially implement the proposed 
intervention: one from the Twin Cities metropolitan area and one from  a region 
outside of the Twin Cities area.  
  
The 2 randomly selected RPCs and the volunteer companion s under their 
supervision (estimated n = 20) will  be invited to participate in this study after 
reviewing the PorchLight Project  research procedures with them. Additional 
volunteer companions in the selected regions may be invited to participate as 
needed to meet the PWML and/or caregiver recruitment targets. If they 
voluntarily agree to participate, they will be asked to sign an informed consent 
form (hard  copy or electronic), complete a baseline survey (hard copy, via phone, 
or electronic), and then undergo the training period .  The training features 
CARES® modules  and the additional [ADDRESS_346626] training sessions 
delivered in person or via teleconference/web conference sessions described in 
the Research Plan. Following this training period, recruitment and enrollment of

Services and Supports : R61 Phase  
VERSION DATE: 10/28/22; IRB Approved 11/1/22  
 Page 13 of 38 Template Revised On : 6/25/[ADDRESS_346627]  will begin. This will 
result in an anticipated sample of 25 PWML a nd/or their family caregivers.  
  
Following a description of the study by [CONTACT_16274], the UMN research coordinator or 
graduate research assistant would complete the screening process and 
consent/assent (similar to our other IRB approved protocols [e.g., 1401S4 7541] ). 
Consent  would be reviewed with the research staff.  The UMN research 
coordinator  or graduate research assistant  will administer a  baseline survey to 
PWML. This can be conducted in -person, via telephone, or in hard copy. As 
applicable, the enrolled caregiver will also complete a survey . After completion 
of the baseline survey, the SC will engage with the PWML  and caregiver  to 
provide routine SCP respi[INVESTIGATOR_283747]: a) referral of the person 
with PWML  and family member to recommended l ong-term services and 
supports (LTSS) in their community; b) assistance for the person with  PWMLs 
and their family caregiver to navigate and interact with healthcare providers; 
and c) provision of guidance, support, and education/resources informed by [INVESTIGATOR_2993] -
home visits or telephone consultations (i.e., the PorchLight Project ). As part of 
the feasibility testing procedures, the volunteer companions will complete a 
usage log and journal entry following each contact [CONTACT_283767]: a) the length and method of contact; b) the main issues 
that are raised by [CONTACT_283768]; c) types of support provided by [CONTACT_16274]; and d) how family members and 
PWML  react to/receive the various recommenda tions and services provided by 
[CONTACT_283769]. A detailed list of procedures is listed below for each type of 
participant.  
 
The research team will utilize additional approaches to assess the feasibility and 
utility of the PorchLight Project  implementation a mong 25 clients and family 
caregivers of PWML .  During the training period the standardized CARES® 
training program will be administered . Following the PorchLight training, an 
anonymous post -session satisfaction survey will be administered to assess the 
usefulness of the CARES® and PorchLight trainings and provide the companions 
with a forum to provide suggestions. We will also monitor turnover of SCs. A 
review checklist of the PorchLight Project , based on similar, reliable checklists [CONTACT_283804] has used i n his various dementia caregiving interventions will be 
administered to participating PWML and caregivers at  [ADDRESS_346628] overall  (see list below) . The research coordinator 
or graduate research assistant s will conduct a brief semi -structured interview  
PROTOCOL TITLE: Utilizing Senior Companions to Enhance Deme ntia Care 
Services and Supports : R61 Phase  
VERSION DATE: 10/28/22; IRB Approved 11/1/22  
 Page 14 of 38 Template Revised On : 6/25/2018  with PMWLs and/or their caregivers [ADDRESS_346629] was conducted . The open -ended 
responses will provide information about how PWML and/or their  caregivers felt 
about volunteer companion visits and the resources they facilitated, and will 
point out how the program can be improved in the R33 Phase. A similar 
interview will be conducted with volunteer companions who implemented the 
PorchLight P roject  (estimated n = 20)  to understand their experience in the 
project and suggestions for improvement . The interview will take place 3 months 
following the client/caregiver enrollment.

and caregivers will participate for approximately 3 -4 months.  
 
9.0 Study Population  
The inclusion criterion for volunteer senior companions is to 1) be a current 
volunteer through LSS -MN 2) be willing to complete the CARES ® modules and 4 -
part training session provided by [CONTACT_283774] 3) be 21 years of age or 
older.  
 
The inclusion criteria for the PWML will be based on one of the following 
scena rios:  1) the person or their caregiver are concerned about the person’s 
memory loss, 2 ) the person has a physician diagnosis of ADRD , 3) the caregiver 
(or PWML) scores 2 or greater on the  AD8, (30) a validated screening interview 
that includes 8 yes/no items. Note: The AD8 will be administered as needed, if 
other criteria had not been previously met in the discussion with the client and/or 
caregiver. The PWML must be [ADDRESS_346633] to provide data to determine a client’s eligibility.  
 
The inclusion criteria for the caregiver will be based on  them  caring for a PMWL 
at least in part related to their cognitive impairment. Their care recipi[INVESTIGATOR_283748]. The clients/caregivers do 
not need to be receiving LSS services to be eligible.  
 
Further, a PWML or caregiver will be ineligible if they live with a current 
diagnosis of a serious psych iatric illness, their symptoms have worsened in the 
last 6 months, and they don’t receive steady, ongoing treatment for those 
symptoms.  
 
Inclusion criteria for the caregiver is that the individual  is 1) 21 years of age or 
older, 2) self-identifies as some one who provides help to the PWML because of 
their cognitive impairments , and 3) the care recipi[INVESTIGATOR_283749] . 
 
To initiate participant recruitment, interested volunteer companions will reach 
out to the UMN study s taff directly, or provide documented verbal or written 
permission to be contact[CONTACT_283775]. Following the volunteer’s 
enrollment and training, the volunteer companions, LSS staff, and/or UMN study 
team will present details about the study to clients and/or caregivers  either in -
person (e.g., monthly meetings, at community outreach events) or over the 
telephone.  If the cl ient and/or caregiver  agree, the SC, LSS staff, or UMN study 
staff person will record their verbal or written permission to be con tacted by

Following discussion with the interested individual, as applicable, the UMN team 
may reach out to the contact’s caregiver or care recipi[INVESTIGATOR_283750]. The UMN study staff  will describe the study process 
in-depth to the client and/or  eligible family caregiver and obtain signed 
consent /verbal assent to participate.

Additional Safeguards:  
In creating our research design and sampling procedures, an important objective 
was to preserve the privacy, confidentiality, and autonomy of all participants. 
Following discussion of the study with a volunteer companion, regional 
coordinator, and/or study  staff , interested PWML and/or caregivers will be asked 
to provide permission to be contact[CONTACT_283777].

 Page 19 of 38 Template Revised On : 6/25/[ADDRESS_346634] the UMN research team directly if they so 
choose. Study staff will reach out to introduce the study to the PWML, family 
caregiver [if applicable], and legally authorized representative (LAR) [i f 
applicable]. If they are interested, staff will provide potential participants with 
the consent materials. Staff will review the consent materials in detail with each 
potential participant, including a description of the types of assessments to be 
obtain ed and time required.  
 
After reviewing consent with the PWML,  staff  will administer a capacity to 
consent questionnaire  (San Diego Brief Assessment of Capacity to Consent 
[UBACC]), (33). If the PWML  scores above the threshold for capacity to consent , 
they will be asked to consent to participate if they so choose.  If the  PWML  scores 
below the threshold , they will be asked to verbally assent to par ticipate if they so 
choose. (Note: Since the consent form was shared and/or reviewed with clients 
with memory loss prior to UBACC administration, staff would not review the 
assent form  additionally (containing similar, but abbreviated information) prior 
to obtaining verbal permission regarding their interest in participation  if they 
were unable to consent ). In the case of PWML assent, signed consent will be 
obtained from the family caregiver or LAR. Participants who are eligible to 
consent will sign the con sent form in electronic or hard copy.  If the PWML scores 
below the threshold and does not have a caregiver or LAR, they are not eligible 
to participate in the study.  
 
Alternatively, if a caregiver is interested in enrolling in the project, and the client 
(or family) prefers that the client not complete data collection procedures 
(surveys/interviews), the research team will review an alternate assent form 
with the involved client, and enroll the caregiver separately. As needed (if the 
client does not partic ipate in the full screening process separately), the research 
team may obtain data necessary to determine eligibility of the client from the 
involved caregiver or LAR. Additionally, if the eligible client is not participating in 
data collection surveys/int erviews, the team would not assess the client’s 
capacity to consent (verbal assent for study involvement in this manner would 
be obtained).  
 
More details (and a diagram detailing the consent/assent procedures) are 
provided in the Consent Process section (2 2.0) below.  
 
Staff will review consent materials (and assent materials, if applicable) with all 
potential participants and give them the opportunity to ask questions. Potential  
participant s may decide to review materials further and ask  questions of staff 
and investigators at a time that is convenient to them. Participants who are

case of assent, the process and the participant’s decision will be documented by 
[CONTACT_464] (no participant signature [CONTACT_183884]). The study staff  or [CONTACT_283804] will also sign the hard copy consent form and /or assent form.  
 
The experience of the research team and the exclusion of participants  with 
serious psychiatric illness will minimize the possibility of psychological risks. The 
unlikelihood of such problems is evident from the absence of any clinically 
significant problems during the past [ADDRESS_346636] the s ervices they are receiving from 
the University of Minnesota, Lutheran Social Service of Minnesota (LSS -MN) or 
other entities.  
 
In the event a caregiver  or PWML  does become upset during the interview 
process, the research coordinator or research assistant w ill contact [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Gaugler, 
who will be available for consultation. If a caregiver  or PWML  is in crisis because 
of their care situation or some other reason, research staff will be instructed to 
consult with [CONTACT_283805]. With the caregiver’s PWML’s  permission , we will then 
contact [CONTACT_283778] (e.g., the 
Alzheimer’s Association). Based on the research team’s experience working with 
their caregiving families, we expect very few or no such instances to occur. If a 
member of the research team does identify neglect or other potentially 
inappropriate care practices, the Adult Protection office/officer will be contact[CONTACT_283779] .  
 
All information obtained from the participants will remain strictly confidential 
and will not be released except at the express written request of the study 
participant. All electronic data will be maintained on [CONTACT_283805]’s office 
computer and an AHC -IS secure shared project folder. Per University of 
Minnesota and the Ac ademic Health Center -Information Systems data security 
guidelines, all data for this project will only be accessed via this secure server. 
The data will be maintained on the secure project folder for approximately 3-5 
years, which is the time, anticipated it would take to disseminate all research 
papers or presentations from these data. Similarly, paper forms of the data will 
be located in a locked file cabinet in D351 Mayo Memorial Building  ([CONTACT_283805]’s 
research office) only accessible to the research te am. Unless the data are being 
filed or accessed, these cabinets will remain locked.

VERSION DATE: 10/28/22; IRB Approved 11/1/22  
 Page 22 of 38 Template Revised On : 6/25/[ADDRESS_346639] . If they verbally agree 
to be contact[CONTACT_283783], the person obtaining their verbal 
agreement (e.g., regional  coordinator, LSS or UMN study staff, another Senior 
Companion, or the potential participant themselves) will document it, and  the 
UMN research team will  proceed to reach out to them to discuss the study 
further, as well as schedule a formal screening and consent process.  Current SCs 
who undergo the training described above will then become “CARES ® Memory 
Support Specialists (CMSS)”.  
 
For PWMLs  and/or their caregivers:  
Potential participants will be initially identified by [CONTACT_283784], regional coordinators , 
and/o r UMN and LSS study staff  who engage with clients/caregivers . They may 
also share project information and obtain verbal permission to be contact[CONTACT_283785]. SCs, regional 
coordinators, or UMN and LSS s tudy staff will briefly describe the study, share a 
flyer and information sheet, and if the person agrees to be contact[CONTACT_283786] , record their verbal permission to be contact[CONTACT_283787] a hard 
copy or electronic form. Alternatively, the pote ntial participant may complete 
their own form or contact [CONTACT_283788]. 
Records of permission to be contact[CONTACT_283789] (e.g., via Qualtrics).  
 
As part of the ir volunteer roles , volunteer companions  regularly meet with (in -
person or over the telephone) older persons to provide respi[INVESTIGATOR_283751]. The PorchLight Project  is building off of this model to provide SCs 
with more specialized training a nd education in dementia and dementia care to 
better meet the needs of older persons they may be helpi[INVESTIGATOR_283752].  Volunteer companions , as part of their volunteer outreach role, will 
continue to engage with older persons to provide respi[INVESTIGATOR_283753] (that is 
hypothesized as more effective based on their dementia care training), and as 
outlined in th is protocol will present the opportunity to participate in the 
research project to these older persons.  If they agree to share their contact 
[CONTACT_283790], we will then proceed to reach out to 
them to schedule a formal screening and consent process.  
 
All SCP clients  that a SC may visit may  be approached  in regards to their 
participation in this project . Depending on the h ome situation of the SCP client, 
either the person with memory loss ( PWML ), the caregiver, or both will be 
approached. The SCs do not have to make a decision on who to approach; all 
screening for eligibility will take place by [CONTACT_283791] .

 Page 23 of 38 Template Revised On : 6/25/2018  Note: Volunteer companions will be alerted by [CONTACT_283792].  
 
SCs, regional coordinators, and/or UMN and LSS study staff will provide existing 
and potential new clients and/or c aregivers with information on the PorchLight 
Project.  T he UMN team  will provide SCs, regional coordinators, and LSS study 
staff with study flyers/information sheets and forms they can use to record a 
client or caregiver’s verbal permission to be contact[CONTACT_283793]. The client or caregiver may complete their own form or contact [CONTACT_283794].  
 
Recruitment Materials  
We will be using flyers and information sheets describing the study.  
 
Payment  
Participating caregivers  and/or PWMLs  will also be asked to complete 1 - and 3 -
month outcome surveys (see below) and will be offered an incentive of $25 to 
complete the baseline, 1 -month, and 3 -month surveys , as well as a semi -
structured exit interview (for a total of $1 00 possible) . 
 
13.0 Withdrawal of Participants  
 
Withdrawal Circumstances  
Participants would withdraw from the study if they indicate to the research 
coordinator they no longer wish to participate, either over the phone, email, or 
in writing.  
 
Withdrawal Procedures  
Our previous dementia caregiver intervention work at UMN has featured low 
loss to follow -up,(34-36) and we will take several similar steps to address 
attrition bias and enhance retention. If a PWML  has died, caregiver follow -up 
interviews  will include queries to determine when the event occurred. An 
enrolled caregiver, if applicable,  would be asked to complete the next follow -up 
survey, as well as the final telephone -interview, in order to collect as much 
information on outcome variables t hat are appropriate (i.e., intention to treat 
principle, which is a feature of pragmatic trial design  (37, 38) ). Additional follow -
up surveys would be omitted. In instances where participants wish to withdraw 
from the study we will determine the reason for study withdrawal. All data

will continue to use the data participants  did provide in the intervals leading up 
to the decision to withdraw, per intention to treat principle.

paid $25 following their successful completion o f each survey and interview in 
the proposed study  (for a total of $100 possible) . 
 
17.[ADDRESS_346643] , the proposed sample s ize of 25 family caregivers 
of PWML (and/or PWML themselves) will be sufficient. As noted in various 
recommendations, a sample of 25 PWML (and/or their caregivers)  and 20 SCs 
(estimated)  who deliver the intervention is appropriate to ensure rich data 
deriv ed for the semi -structured interviews proposed.  Additional volunteer 
companions may be enrolled in order to reach the target sample of PWML 
and/or caregivers.  
 
As a major objective of this project is to examine the feasibility, acceptablity, and 
utility of  the PorchLight Project  intervention, quantitative analyses will large rely 
on descriptive statistics. Specifically , quantitative analyses will utilize frequency 
tables and means to examine sample characteristics and item -level responses to 
the PorchLight Project  review checklist. Where appropriate, bivariate analyses

VERSION DATE: 10/28/22; IRB Approved 11/1/22  
 Page 26 of 38 Template Revised On : 6/25/2018  may also be conducted (e.g., paired T -Tests; Chi -square analyses) to examine 
factors associated with caregivers’ perceptions of utility and feasibility of the 
PorchLight Project  at the [ADDRESS_346644] folder for approximately 3-5 years which is the time anticipated 
it will take to disseminate any and all research papers or presentations from 
these data. Similarly, paper forms o f the data will be located in a locked file 
cabinet in D351 Mayo Memorial Building ([CONTACT_283805]’s research office) only 
accessible to the research team. Unless the data are being filed or accessed, 
these cabinets will remain locked.   
 
The PI, research coor dinator, and graduate research assistants will plan on 
creating a tracking file for the purposes of interview reminders and completion 
of the various data collection procedures. However, it is important to note that 
in the data analysis files, no identifyi ng information will be entered or included. 
Any hard copy forms collected by [CONTACT_283796] -MN staff (e.g., SCs) will be maintained in a 
locked file cabinet at LSS -MN and will be transferred securely to [CONTACT_283805] and 
D351 Mayo at the conclusion of the project.  SCs will be asked not to collect or 
record any personal health information on their clients.

 Page 27 of 38 Template Revised On : 6/25/[ADDRESS_346646] will pose minimal risks to study participants, the 
Principal  Investigator (PI), [CONTACT_283805], will serve as the primary monitoring 
entity of this study. As noted in the Protection of Human Research Subjects 
section, the proposed study involves no invasive procedures and there will be no 
physical risks to study parti cipants. The consideration of need is potentially 
stressful, and thus there are possible psychological risks for the PWML or 
caregiver. However, potential participants with a history of serious mental illness 
(i.e., any major psychiatric disorder) will not  be included in the study. 
Specifically, if a participant indicates they have clinical depression or a similar 
mental illness whose: a) symptoms have exacerbated in the last six months, and 
b) are not receiving steady, ongoing pharmacological or other trea tment for 
these symptoms during the screening procedure, they will be excluded from our 
project. Further,  since the research team has considerable experience providing 
psychosocial support to dementia caregivers on various research protocols, 
serious psychological risks are unlikely to occur. The potential social or legal risks 
for the participants relate onl y to possible violations of confidentiality. With 
respect to private information entered, the design of the system will include a 
structure of permissions with password protection to limit access to materials so 
only dementia caregivers and the research st aff can view sensitive information.  
 
Additional monitoring support will be provided by [CONTACT_283797] (ISM), [CONTACT_283806], Mayo Professor and Head of the Division of Health 
Policy and Management in the University of Minnesota School of Pub lic Health.  
 
A. Data and Safety Monitoring Procedures: Monitoring Study Safety  
B1. Monitoring study safety. In addition to ongoing review of the protocol and 
human subjects research compliance during weekly project meetings with staff, 
the PI ([CONTACT_283805]) will generate annual reports to ensure that each case 
complies with Institutional Review Board (IRB) requirements, including use of 
IRB-approved forms (particularly the consent form), and that each staff person 
on the proposed project adheres to the study protocol. In both weekly meetings 
and audit reports, [CONTACT_283805] will actively work with project staff to minimize 
research -associated risk and protect confidentiality of participant data (see 
Protection of Human Research Subjects section). The research co ordinator and 
research assistant s will be trained to interview in ways that are non -threatening, 
friendly, and respectful. We will emphasize to all participants that they do not 
have to complete any question they do not want to answer, and that the

In the event that a caregiver does become upset during the survey or interview 
process, the research coordinator or research assistant will contact [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Gaugler, 
who will be available for consultation. If a caregiver is in crisis because of their 
care situation or for some other reason, research staff will be instructed to 
consult with [CONTACT_283805]. With the caregiver’s permission, we will then contact 
[CONTACT_283778] (e.g., the Alzheimer’s 
Association). Based on the research team’s experience working with their 
caregiving families, we expect very few or no such instances to occur. If a 
member of the research team does identify neglect or ot her potentially 
inappropriate care practices, the state Ombudsman will be notified to protect 
the rights of persons with dementia and their families . 
 
All information obtained from the participants will remain strictly confidential 
and will not be released  except at the express written request of the study 
participant. All electronic data will be maintained on [CONTACT_283805]’s office 
computer and the School of Public Health shared project folder. Per University of 
Minnesota and the Academic Health Center -Infor mation Systems data security 
guidelines, all data on [CONTACT_283805]’s AHC shared server are protected by [CONTACT_283798]. Gaugler or the research team. The data will be 
maintained on [CONTACT_283805]’s AHC server folder for approximately 3-5 years which 
is the time anticipated it will take to disseminate any and all research papers or 
presentations from these data. Similarly, paper forms of the data will be located 
in a locked file cabinet in D351 Mayo Building ([CONTACT_283805]’s research office)  only 
accessible to the research team. Unless the data are being filed or accessed, 
these cabinets will remain locked.  
 
B2. Annual audit reports. The responsibility of [CONTACT_283805] (who also have 
oversight for the data management and analysis of the project) will include the 
production of an annual report that will highlight the results of the audit 
analysis, as well as study progress. In addition, [CONTACT_283805] will provide 
information on any deviations from the approved protocol (e.g., deviations in 
adhering to study eligibility criteria), error rates, and any other issues related to 
the progress of the study. The ISM will review the audit report to ensure ongoing 
quality control, and will work with [CONTACT_283805], if needed, to ascertain if audited 
cases  deviate from the approved study protocol. In instances of adverse events 
occurring (see below) the University of Minnesota IRB will be notified.

B3. Reporting Adverse Events and Unanticipate d Problems  
In addition to ongoing monitoring of protocol and human subjects compliance 
and reporting and the production of annual case audits, [CONTACT_283805] will 
generate safety reports on an ongoing basis that will list adverse events, serious 
events, unant icipated events,  events related to or associated with the 
intervention, and the potential causality of the intervention to the event for each 
participant should they occur.  Taken from the National Institutes of Mental 
Health policy on Data and Safety Monit oring in Clinical Trials and the Guidance 
on Reporting Adverse Events to Institutional Review Board for NIH -Supported 
Multicenter Trials (as suggested in the Policy of the National Institute of Nursing 
Research for Data and Safety Monitoring of Clinical Tr ials), the definition of each 
event is as follows:  
Adverse event.  Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation participant that does not necessarily have to have a causal 
relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can there fore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with 
the use of [an intervention], whether or not considered related to the 
[interventions].  
Serious adverse event.  Any adverse experience that results in any of the 
following outcomes: death, a life threatening experience, inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or a 
congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not 
result in death, be life threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], may be

 Page 30 of 38 Template Revised On : 6/25/2018  considered a serious adverse drug experience when based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcome s listed in this definition.  
Unanticipated Problem.  Any adverse experience, the specificity or 
severity of which is not consistent with the risks information described in 
the [protocol or consent documents].  
Related to (or associated with) the intervention.  There is a reasonable 
possibility that the experience may have been caused by [CONTACT_283800].  
Causality.  A reasonable possibility that the product is etiologically related 
to the adverse event. Causality assessment includes, for example, 
assessment of temporal relationships, dechallenge/rechallenge 
information, association with (or lack of association with) underlying 
disease, presence (or absence) of a more likely cause, plausibility, etc.  
 
In the instance of an adverse event, [CONTACT_283805] w ill classify whether the event is 
unanticipated, adverse, or seriously adverse, whether the event is unanticipated 
or related to the intervention, and what potentially caused the event. [CONTACT_283804] will review study -related data on an ongoing basis, will a lert the 
University of Minnesota IRB as they occur, and will document adverse events in 
their annual report for the ISM and NIA program officer if these events occur. 
Specifically, [CONTACT_283805] will utilize an adverse event form that will provide detail 
on the occurrence (who, what, when, where, why if relevant) of any adverse, 
serious adverse, unanticipated event/problem, and whether these events were 
related to participation in the proposed project. If adverse events occur during 
the R61 Phase of the proje ct, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_283754]. In our annual Data 
Safety and Monitoring Report, we will provide these adverse reports to the 
Independent Study Monitor to review and approve  via a signed cover letter.  The 
final, approved Data Safety and Monitoring Report would then be sent to the 
Program Officer at NIA for review.  
 
B4. Procedures to Ensure Compliance with the Monitoring Plan across Study Sites  
Not applicable.  
 
B5. Assessment  of External Factors  
[CONTACT_283805], via his own research experience as well as his editorial board 
service, is kept abreast of developments in ADRD caregiver interventions. This 
proximity to cutting -edge research on family caregiving interventions in additi on 
to his regular review of the literature he conducts to support his various 
dissemination efforts will allow the research team to assess issues related to the 
delivery of community -based services and supports to PWMLs  and their family 
caregivers. If such  developments reveal any potential threats to participant

addressed in the annual audit reports provided to the ISM and the University of 
Minnesota IRB.  
 
B6. Plans for Interi m Analysis  
There are no planned interim/futility analyses. Interim analyses are not planned 
because in the R61 Phase of this project, there is no randomly assigned control 
condition; the objective of the R61 Phase is to initially implement and refine the 
PorchLight Project’s  content, structure, and delivery where needed in preparation for 
the subsequent R33 Phase (years 3 -5).  For these reasons, we did not deem futility 
analyses appropriate.

participant. All electronic data will be maintained on an AHC -IS secure shared 
server. The data will be maintained on the  secure server  for approximately 2 -3 
years, which is the time anticipated it will take to disseminate any and all 
research papers or presentations from these data. Similarly, paper forms of the 
data will be located in a locked file cabinet in D351 Mayo Memorial Building ([CONTACT_283804]’s research office) only accessible to the research team. Unless the data 
are being filed or accessed, these cabinets will remain locked. Also, all 
correspondence that contains protected health  information will take place via 
encrypted email, and the entirety of the research team will have completed 
HIPAA and CITI training prior to conducti ng human subjects  research.  
 
Access to Participants  
Our research team is not permitted to access medical re cords. Any private 
information that the research team is allowed to have access to will need to be 
provided by [CONTACT_2299]. This includes, but is not limited to, survey responses, 
semi -structured interview responses, and contact [CONTACT_3031].

description of the types of assessments to be obtained and the time required.  
Study staff will then  administer a capacity to consent questionnaire for the 
PWML  (San Diego Brief Assessment of Capacity to Consent [UBACC]), (33); if the 
PWML  scores above the threshold for capacity to consent , they will be asked to 
sign the consent form if they  choose to participate . If the PWML  scores below 
the threshold, then consent will be obtained from the LAR or caregiver and the 
PWML will verbally assent to study participation if they  choose to particip ate 
(UMN team will document that verbal permission was obtained via the assent 
form). If the PWML scores below the threshold and there is no LAR or caregiver 
involved, the PWML will not be eligible to participate.  
 
Alternatively, if a caregiver is interes ted in enrolling in the project, and the client 
prefers not to complete data collection procedures (surveys/interviews), the 
research team will review an alternate assent form with the involved client, and 
enroll the caregiver separately. In this scenario,  the client’s capacity to consent is 
not assessed. The figure below reviews the study consent/assent procedures for 
clients (PWML) and their caregivers.

A gap highlighted in the design, evaluation, and translation of dementia 
interventions is the lack of stakeholder engag ement throughout the scientific 
process. (39, 40)  Stakeholder engagement is important in the design, 
development, and evaluation of pragmatic trials. For these reason s, we will 
adopt various strategies outlined by [CONTACT_229335] (41) and others to engage 
stakeholders to refine and enhance  the implementatio n of the PorchLight 
Project ’s for PWML  and their family members. A Community Advisory Board 
(CAB) consisting of family members and care professionals, will offer stakeholder 
input.  
 
During periodic  meetings (approximately 2 hours each), the CAB will revie w the 
aims to evaluate progress. Each meeting will also include time to discuss 
concerns so that as a group the DHR can propose mechanisms to resolve issues 
during  the implementation and evaluation  of the PorchLight Project . The 
philosophy underpi[INVESTIGATOR_283755], 
mutual respect, and an interaction process where all viewpoints are heard and 
discussed openly. The UMN research coordinator or graduate research assistants 
will moderate and digitally record all meetings and  interviews to provide an 
additional source of qualitative data on stakeholder perspectives. Open sharing 
of meeting transcripts with all CAB members to review and edit will also occur to

 Page 35 of 38 Template Revised On : 6/25/[ADDRESS_346653], the CAB’s role as key collaborator on the PorchLight 
Project  will be emphasized. The CAB meetings will serve to engage key 
stakeholders from different orga nizations, care specialties, and communities to 
further position  the PorchLight Project  as an innovative approach to assist PWML  
and their family caregivers.  
 
The CARES® interactive online modules (as previously described) are designed to 
provide education, tools, and resources to help professionals from various 
disciplines as well as families provide more person -centered, effective care 
across the spectrum of ADRD. The CARES® modules are developed specifically for 
those with lower health literacy.

provi ded by [CONTACT_283801] , [CONTACT_283805] can devote up to 95% of his 
time to research projects and he will have the necessary effort available to make 
the current project a success.  
 
[CONTACT_283805]’s secure suite in the Mayo Building includes his own office, three 
other connected office spaces, a meeting room, and a file area that house 9 of 
his research team members (e.g., two research coordinators, f ive graduate 
research assistants, and two additional research assistant). [CONTACT_283805]’s office 
suites are equipped with secure computers (including the necessary statistical 
software), two printers (including one color), web cameras, telephone access,

on the research team’s experience working with their caregiving families, we 
expect very few or no such instances to occur. If a mem ber of the research team 
does identify neglect or other potentially inappropriate care practices, the state 
Ombudsman will be notified to protect the rights of persons with dementia and 
their families.

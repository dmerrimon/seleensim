A common variance, 431.2, and a common ICE occurrence rate,  8%, are assumed among the patterns. 
In order for EDS (VAS) to have at least 90% power when Holm’s method is applied, i.e., in order to have 90% probability that EDS (VAS) is statistically significant when an alpha is set to 0.025 (two -sided), 
310 patients /arm will be needed.
 
Targeted Estimand:  
The summary of the targeted estimand is as follows:  
Treatment Condition  
Treatment condition based on the assigned treatment group.  
Population  
DED patients based on the Inclusion and Exclusion criteria of the study.  
Variable  
Change from baseline to Day 85 in total eye stain score and EDS (VAS) including measurements 
after intercurrent events  (i.e., treatment policy strategy) . Potential intercurrent events of the study 
are as follows:  
 Discontinuation of the study treatment due to an adverse event  
 Discontinuation of the study treatment due to lack of efficacy  
 Discontinuation of the study treatment due to uncomfortable feeling of the study drug  
Population -level Summary  
Difference in means between the two treatment co nditions . 
 
Primary Efficacy Analyses:  
The primary efficacy endpoints  are change from baseline to Day 85 in conjunctival sum  fluorescein  
staining  score and EDS (VAS)  on study eye , which are used regardless of whether or not the following 
ICEs occur: discont inuation  of the study treatment due to an AE, lack of efficacy , or uncomfortable 
feeling of the study drug. Patients’ measurements  will be made even after occurrence of those ICEs. For 
each of the primary endpoints, the Analysis of Covariance  with baseline value , sex and treatment as 
covariates is used in order to make a comparison between the treatment groups. Least squares means will 
be calculated for the comparison.  
 
The data set to be used for the primary analyses is  the F AS. 
 Missing values will be imputed using the PMM  with MI. Patterns to be used for the PMM are, as feasible, 
determined in each treatment group by [CONTACT_394136], or the type of ICEs if patients had an ICE. For example, if patients who discontinued the study treatment due to an AE had missing 
values, their missing values will be imputed from the patients who had the same ICE, i.e., discontinuation 
of the study treatment due to an AE . If enough patients to develop an imputation model in each pattern  
does not exist, the control- based mean imputation proposed by [CONTACT_394137]. (2017) will be applied 
instead of the PMM with MI.

 STUDY DESCRIPTION  
3.1 Study Design 
This is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-masked, vehicle-controlled, 
parallel -group study. Patients will be randomized to one of the following treatment 
groups at Visit 2 : 
•  K-161;  
• Placebo Ophthalmic Solution (vehicle);  
Patient s who qualify after the initial Screening V isit will enter the Run -in Period , where 
they will self -administer vehicle  for approximately 14 days. Those who qualify at 
Visit 2 (Day 1) will administer  either  K-161 or vehicle  in a double- masked 
fashion during the 12- week Primary Period . At Visit 6 (Day 85), patient s enter ing the 
40-week Extension Period will be dispensed study drug. The 52- week Overall Period will 
comprise the 12-week Primary Period and 40-week Extension Period. 
A total of 620 patients  (310 per arm) will be randomized for the study.  
 The f irst 300 randomized patients (150/arm) 
will be assigned into the 52-week Overall Period and the rest of study population 
(approximately 320 [160/arm ] patients ) will be assigned into 12- week Primary Period . 
The patient s who are assigned into the 12- week Primary Period  will proceed to Visit 6.5 
(Day 99) for post- dose assessments and complete the study.  Patient s, sponsor, c linical 
research organization  (CRO), and site personnel will be masked to treatment assignmen t. 
Patient s will be instructed not to discuss their assigned dosing regimen or perceived 
treatment effects with other study participants.  
The schedule of required assessments is provided in Table  1. The timing of patient visits 
and examinations will be consistent throughout the study. For the order of assessments refer to Section  5.1.

Although a patient is not obligated to give his/her reason for discontinuing study drug, 
the Investigator will make a reasonable effort to obtain the reason while fully respecting the patient’s rights. The reason for discontinuation of study drug must be documented in the electronic case report form ( eCRF ). The c linical study r eport will include the 
reason(s) for discontinuation of study drug. 
4.4 Withdrawal Criteria  
The patient  has the right to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason 
without prejudice to the patient’s  future medical care. Nevertheless, every attempt will be 
made to prevent missing data and to obtain complete follow-up of all patients. 
Patients who meet study drug discontinuation criteria described in Section  4.3 will be 
discontinued from study drug; however, are not required to withdraw from the study 
unless the patient withdraws consent completely. As such, these patients will be encouraged to remain in the study and asked to attend all of the remaining study visits through Visit 6 (f or the patients who are assigned into the 12 -week Primary Period) or 
Visit 9 (f or the pati ents who are assigned into the 5 2-week Overall  Period ) (Table  1). 
Patients  who choose to withdraw from the study will be asked if they are prepared to 
complete a last visit. In this case, the same evaluations as the End of T reatment P eriod  
(Visit 6 or 9), or at least, the same evaluations as the Post- dose A ssessment V isit (Visit 
6.5 or 10) should be performed. If a patient fails to actively maintain contact [CONTACT_31387] , reasonable efforts (telephone calls to family members or friends, email 
contacts, etc.) will be made in order to encourage the patient to complete the study visits. 
If the patient withdraws from the study, the reason should be captured. The patient  will be withdrawn from the study if:  
1.The patient with draws consent to attend the remaining study visits
2. L ost to follow -up
3. Sponsor termination of study4.Other

November 22, 2021 Page 31 of 82 Although a patient is not obligated to give his/her reason for withdrawing from the study , 
the Investigator will make a reasonable effort to obtain the reason while fully respecting 
the patient’s rights. Unless revoked, further contact [CONTACT_394138] (ICF). The reason for withdrawal from the study  must be documented in the eCRF . The c linical 
study r eport will include the reason(s) for withdrawal from the study . 
If a patient  withdraws from the study due to an AE, the patient will be asked to return to 
the clinic for, at a minimum, the evaluations scheduled for post- dose assessments. If the 
AE has still not resolved, additional follow-up will be performed, as appropriate. Every 
effort will be made by [CONTACT_293797], or the m edical monitor and Investigator agree that further follow -
up is not necessary. If patients are lost to follow -up, the Investigator will make [ADDRESS_494541] be made and documented in the study records.  
4.5 Replacement, Rescreening, and Retesting  
 Replacement  
Patient s who are screened for the study may be replaced if they never are randomly 
assigned study drug or are withdrawn from the study before they administer any study drug after randomization . The replacement patients will receive a new randomly assigned 
treatment and not the treatment as signment of the replaced patient. Patient s who self-
administer any study drug after randomization and subsequently are withdrawn early from the study will not be replaced.  
 Rescreening  
Patient s who fail to satisfy inclusion and exc lusion criteria at screening may be 
rescreened 1 additional time at the discretion of the sponsor.  Screen failures due to 
inclusion and/or exclusion criteria that could transiently change and do not compromise the patient’s safety as judged by [CONTACT_394139]. A ll eligibility 
assessments will be repeated regardless of the reason for the initial screen failure and n ew 
subject number will be assigned. Rescreening decision must be confirmed by [CONTACT_456] ’s medical monitor. 
 Retesting  
Clinical labs with clinically significant abnormalities (per the principal Investigator’s  [PI] 
assessment ) can be retested 1 time if there is a reasonable expectation that abnormality 
will resolve within the S creening P eriod  (21 days at maximum). Unschedul ed visits 
should be allowed within Screening P eriod . 
CONFIDENTIAL   Kowa Research Institute, Inc.  
K-161-3.01, Study Protocol   K-[ADDRESS_494542] code will be used (Section  4.5.3). If a patient is 
rescreened, the patient will be assigned with a new subject code  (Section  4.5.2).  
Patients  who have signed informed consent and subsequently fail to satisfy inclusion and 
exclusion criteria  are defined as screen failures. For all screen failures, the reason( s) for 
screen failure will be recorded on the patient’s source document and eCRF.  
Each patient who meets all the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria at Visit [ADDRESS_494543] codes and  kit numbers will be assigned automatically to each patient as they are 
entered into the IWRS. All patient s will be randomized into either vehicle or a ctive 
treatment group at Visit 2 (Day 1 ) in a 1:[ADDRESS_494544] 300 (150/arm) randomized patients will be assigned into the 
52-week  Overall Period and the rest of study population (approximately 320 [160/arm] 
patients) will be assigned into the 12- week Primary Period.  
The site staff will dispense the required kit(s). Both the subject codes and the dispensed study drug kit number(s) will be recorded on the patient’s source document and eCRF. Patients, sponsor, CRO, and site personnel will be masked to treatment assignment . 
After Visit 6 (Day 85), patients  who are randomized to enter the 40 -week Extension 
Period will proceed to Visit 7 (Day 169) until Visit 10 (Day 379). Other patients, who are randomized to enter the 12-week Primary Period only, will proceed to Visit 6.5 (Day 99) for post- dose assessments and will complete the study.

6.2 Study Visits  
For each patient , a maximum of 10 scheduled visits will be performed: 
• Visit 1  at Day -14 ( Day -21 to -12): Screening: The screening examination to 
determine patient  eligibility can take place anytime within this time period.

guidelines, local laws, F DA GCP regulations (21 Code of Federal Regulations [CFR] 
Parts  11, 50, 54, 56, and 312), and other applicable guidance documents. 
If the Investigator considers enrolling a patient that does not meet all inclusion or 
exclusion criteria, an exemption must be requested from the sponsor’s m edical monitor 
prior to patient  enrollment. The justification for the exemption must be document by [CONTACT_3786] . The approval or rejection of the exemption must be documented by [CONTACT_103]’s m edical m onitor prior to the patient ’s enrollment or screen failure. 
Protocol non- compliance must be reported to the sponsor or its representatives. Each 
deviation and the reason for its occurrence must be documented. The sponsor retains the right to require the withdrawal of any patient  who violates the protocol.

8.[ADDRESS_494553] lenses is not recommended for the duration of such combination therapy. 
The following medications are permitted  as long  as the dosage is  stable : 
• Systemic tetracycline compounds (e.g., tetracycline, doxycycline, or 
minocycline), macrolides (e.g., azithromycin): for at least 30 days prior to Visit 1 
and dose will remain stabl e until the end of the 12- week Primary Period  
• Any medication (topi[INVESTIGATOR_166470]) known to cause ocular drying, such as systemic anticholinergic medications (e.g., atropi[INVESTIGATOR_050], homatropi[INVESTIGATOR_050]), antidepressants and antipsychotic agents, statins, diuretics, beta-blockers, NSAIDs : for at least 30 days prior to Visit 1 and dose will remain stable until the 
end of the 12- week Primary Period  
o Epi[INVESTIGATOR_394123] 2 days prior to any study visit.  
• Omega -3 fatty acid supplements in doses above 3000 mg/day, oral hormonal 
contraceptives, hormone replacement therapy for menopause: for 12 weeks prior to Visit 1  and dose will remain stable until the end of the 12- week Primary Period . 
Omega -3 fatty acid supplements in doses equal to or below  3000 mg/day are 
permitted.  
Any prohibited and restricted medications, devices, and procedures indicated for dry eye disease are permitted  as “rescue therapy ” after all assessments are completed at Visit 6

November 22, 2021 Page 63 of 82 (Table  1). Especially,  will be summarized as described i n 
Section 5.2.10. All other prohibited medications, other than isotretinoin, systemic  
, and restricted medications, devices, and procedures are permitted as 
“permitted therapy” after all assessments are completed at Visit 6.  If more than one 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_394124], the medicinal products must be 
administered at least 15 minutes apart.  
Any non- emergent  ocular surgical procedure is prohibited until the end of the 12- week 
Primary Period . However, if the patient ’s condition necessitates a surgical ocular 
procedure during the study, the patient may undergo rescue ophthalmic surgery. In this case, the use of study medication should be interrupted in the eye undergoing the procedure until resolution or stabilization of this condition and full recovery after surgery 
as determined by [CONTACT_737]. The decision to interrupt or restart the study medication for a specific ocular procedure/condition should be based on the best cli nical 
judgment  of the Investigator and preferably after consultation with the m edical m onitor.  

CONFIDENTIAL   Kowa Research Institute, Inc.  
K-161-3.01, Study Protocol   K-[ADDRESS_494554]. Any worsening of the patient ’s disease under 
study or other medical conditions will also be considered to be an AE , unless it is within 
the normal range of disease fluctuation for that patient . 
Clinically meaningful (for a given patient ) changes in physical examination findings and 
abnormal objective test findings (e.g., clinical laboratory  tests) are also recorded as AEs. 
The criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test finding should be reported as an AE are as follows:  
1. Test result is associated with accompanying symptoms, and/or ; 
2. Test result requires additional diagnostic  testing or medical/surgical intervention, 
and/or; 
3. Test result leads to a change in study dosing or withdrawal from the study, 
significant additional concomitant drug treatment or other therapy, and/or; 
4. Test result leads to any of the outcomes included in the definition of an SAE  
(Section  9.2). 
Merely repeating a test, in the absence of any of the above conditions, does not meet condition number [ADDRESS_494555] result that is determined to be an error does not require reporting as an 
AE. 
A treatment -emergent AE (TEAE) is defined as an AE that begins after the start of study 
drug or an event that begins before the start of the study drug and worsens in intensity after starting treatment.  
 Reporting of AEs  
At each evaluat ion, the Investigator will determine whether any AEs  have occurred. The 
patient  will be questioned in a general way and no specific symptoms will be suggested. 
If any AEs  have occurred, they will be recorded on the AE  pages of the eCRF  and in the 
patient ’s medical record . If known, the diagnosis will be recorded, in preference to the 
listing of individual signs and symptoms. 
AE reporting begins when informed consent is obtained and ends at the conclusion of the 
study, unless an unresolved AE  is still being followed. 
The severity of the AE  will be graded as follows:

activities . 
Moderate  The AE  causes some interference with daily activities. 
Severe   The AE  causes all normal daily activities to be completely halted . 
 
The relationship of each AE to the study drug will be determined by [CONTACT_394140]:  
• Related : A reasonable possibility exists that the study drug caused the AE . A 
related AE can be further defined as follows: 
o Occurs within a reasonable temporal sequence to administration of study 
drug 
o Cannot be explained by [CONTACT_9153] 
o Improves or disappears on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_80675] (de-challenge) 
o Reappears on repeated exposure to study drug (re-challenge) 
o Is an unusual event that is known to be associated with the drug or this class of compound, and cannot be explained by [CONTACT_80695] ’s physical condition 
o Unlikely  to be attributed to concurrent disease or other drugs or a 
clinically reasonable response on withdrawal (de- challenge)  
• Not Related: A reasonable possibility does not exist that the study drug caused 
the AE . A not related AE can be further defined as follo ws: 
o Occurs with a temporal relationship to administration of study drug which makes a causal relationship improbable 
o Other drugs, chemicals or underlying disease provide plausible explanations of causality  
o Is known to be associated with the participant’s clinical condition, or with other medication taken by [CONTACT_394141]:

AEs can be re- evaluated via t elephone and documented. If the AE is  still not resolved, 
additional follow-up will be performed as appropriate. Every effort will be made by [CONTACT_394143] , or the 
medical monitor and Investigator agree that further follow -up is not necessary. Th e 
follow-up of AEs after post -dose assessments at Visits 6.5 or 10 will be documented in

 Reporting of SAEs  
All SAEs occurring from the time of informed consent until Visit 6.5 (patients enrolled in 
the Primary Period only) or Visit 10 (all other patients) must be reported to the CRO safety personnel within 24 hours of the knowledge of the occurrence (this refers to any AE that meets any of the aforementioned serious criteria). All SAEs that the Investigator considers related to st udy drug occurring after post- dose assessments at Visits 6.[ADDRESS_494558]  be reported to the CRO or the sponsor/designee. 
To report the SAE, the site staff will complete the SAE form electronically in the electronic data capture (EDC) system for the study. W hen the form is completed, the 
CRO safety personnel will be notified electronically and will retrieve the form. If the event meets serious criteria and it is not possible to access the EDC system, site staff will send a completed paper SAE form to within [ADDRESS_494559] continue to follow-up with the patient until the SAE has subsided

 Serious Unexpected Suspected Adverse Reactions 
According to FDA CFR 312.32(a) and FDA Guidance “Safety Reporting Requirements 
for Investigational New Drugs (INDs ) and BA/BE  (Bioavailability/Bioequivalence) 
Studies” finalized D ecember 2012, suspected adverse reaction  means any AE for which 
there is a reasonable possibility that the medicinal product caused the AE. The phrase reasonable possibility means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the AE and the medicinal product. 
The following are examples of types of evidence that would suggest a causal relationship 
between the drug and the AE (i.e., reasonable possibility ): 
• A single occurrence of an event that is uncommon and known to be strongly associated with drug exposure ( e.g., angioedema, hepatic injury, Stevens-Johnson 
syndrome) 
• One or more occurrences of an event that is not commonly associated with drug exposure, but is otherwise uncommon in the population exposed to the drug (e.g., tendon rupture) 
Suspec ted adverse reactions are the subset of all AEs for which there is a reasonable 
possibility that the drug caused the event. The Investigator will initially classify the relatedness of an AE, but the final classification is subject to the m edical m onitor’s 
determination unless revised by [CONTACT_456], which has the ultimate responsibility for judging relatedness. 
A suspected adverse reaction is considered unexpected  if it is not listed in the Reference 
Safety Information in Section 6 of the K-161 I nvestigator ’s Brochure or is not listed at 
the specificity or severity that has been described in the K -161 Investigator’s Brochure. 
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered serious if, in the view of either the 
Investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: Death, a 
life-threatening AE, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], a 
persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect (Section  9.2.1 ). Important 
medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6721], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or patient  and may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. 
Any AE m eeting the definitions of suspected adverse reaction, unexpected, and serious is 
considered a serious unexpected suspected adverse reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R). In accordance 
with the FDA Guidance “Safety Reporting Requirements for INDs and BA/BE Studies” finalized De cember 2012, the sponsor will un mask  the study data for patient s 
experiencing S[LOCATION_003]Rs and only report those for patients who are on the active K -[ADDRESS_494561]. All such reports will be submitted to the Investigator(s), FDA, and IRB/IEC /REC in an expedited manner.

 STATISTICAL METHODS AND DATA ANALYSI S 
10.1 Sample Size Justification  
The parameters to be needed for the calculation of sample size were estimated from the 
previous Phase 2  study (K -161-2.01US). In order to take intercurrent events (ICEs) into 
account, 4 different patient patterns are considered: (1) patients who were assigned to K-161  and had an ICE, (2) patients who were assigned to K-[ADDRESS_494562] an ICE, (3) patients who were assigned to vehicle and had an ICE, and (4) patients who were assigned to v ehicle and did not have an ICE. 
Regarding EDS (VAS), a population mean in each pattern is assumed as follows:  
Assigned Treatment  Intercurrent Event  
Not Occurred  Occurred  
K-161  (1) -10.0 (2)   -3.6 
Vehicle  (3)   -3.6 (4)   -3.6 
 
A common variance, 431.2, and a common ICE occurrence rate, 8%, are  assumed among 
the patterns. In order for EDS (VAS) to have at least 90% power when Holm’s method is 
applied, i.e., in order to have 90% probability that EDS (VAS) is statistically significant when an alpha is set to 0.025 (two- sided), 310 patients/arm will be needed . 
10.2 Targeted Estimand  
The summary of the targeted estimand is  as follows: 
Treatment Condition 
Treatment condition based on the assigned treatment group. 
Population 
DED patients based on the Inclusion and Exclusion criteria of the study. 
Variable 
Change from baseline to Day 85 in total eye stain score and EDS (VAS) including measurements after intercurrent ev ents (i.e., treatment policy strategy). Potential 
intercurrent events of the study are as follows: 
 Discontinuation of the study treatment due to an adverse event 
 Discontinuation of the study treatment due to lack of efficacy 
 Discontinuation of the study treatment due to uncomfortable feeling of the study 
drug

10.3 Study Populations  
The following analysis populations will be considered: 
Full Analysis Set (FAS)  in the 12- week Primary Period : will include all randomized 
patients who received at least 1  dose of study treatment. Pa tients  will be analyzed 
according to their randomized treatment group, regardless of whether they adhere to their 
assigned treatment.  The FAS  will be used as the primary efficacy analyses.  
Per Protocol Set (PPS) in the 12- week Primary Period: will include all ra ndomized 
patients without any major protocol deviations and have valid baseline and Day 85 primary endpoint values. 
Major protocol deviations will be pre -specified prior to 
unmask ing the study. PPS will be used to assess robustness of the primary analysis 
results. 
Safety Population in the 12- week Primary Period : will include  all randomized patient s 
who have received at least 1 dose of study treatment . 
FAS in the 52- week Overall Period : will include  the randomized patients who are 
assigned into the 52-week Overall Period and received at least 1  dose of study treatment. 
Patients  will be analyzed according to their randomized treatment group, regardless of 
whether they adhere to their assigned treatment. 
Safety Population in the 5 2-week Overall Period:  will include  randomized patients for the 
52-week Overall Period and who had at least 1 dose of study treatment. 
10.4 Analysis of Efficacy Parameters  
The primary efficacy endpoints are change from baseline to Day 85 in conjunctival sum fluorescein stain ing score on study eye and EDS (VAS) , which are used regardless of 
whether or not the following ICE s occur: discontinuation of the study treatment due to an 
AE, lack of efficacy or uncomfortable feeling of the study drug. Patients’ measurements 
will be made even after occurrence of those ICEs. For each of the primary endpoints, the analysis of covariance with baseline value , sex and treatment as covariates is used in 
order to make a comparison between the treatment groups. Least squares means will be calculated for the comparison.  
The data set to be used for the primary analyses is the FAS.  
Missing values will be imputed using the pattern mixture model (PMM) with multiple imputation (MI). Patterns to be used for the PMM are,  as feasible, determined in each 
treatment group by [CONTACT_394136], or the type of ICEs if patients had an ICE.  For example, if patients who discontinued the study treatment due to an AE  had 
missing values, their missing values will be imputed from the patients who had the same 
ICE, i.e., discontinuation of the study treatment due to an AE . If enough patients to 
develop an imputation model in each pattern do not exist, the control- based mean

November 22, 2021 Page 72 of 82 imputation proposed by [CONTACT_394144] ( Mehrotra 2017 ) will be applied instead of the PMM 
with MI.  
If the MI is applied, multiple parameter estimates will be combined using Rubin’s rule 
(Rubin 1987 ). 
With regard to multiplicity caused by [CONTACT_941] 2 primary endpoints, Holm’s method 
(Holm  1979 ) will be utilized. First, an endpoint with a smaller p- value will be tested at 
alpha=0.025 (two- sided). If the first test is significant, another endpoint will be tested at 
alpha= 0.05 (tw o-sided). Otherwise, the second test will not be performed.  
Planned analyses at Day [ADDRESS_494563] access to the summary of the results comparing the two arms.  
As a sensitivity analysis, a tippi[INVESTIGATOR_11300], at which the primary analysis result tur ns out to 
be not-significant, is examined in each ICE.  Further details will be included in a separated statistical analysis plan.   
 Analysis of Secondary Efficacy Parameters  
The key secondary efficacy endpoint is change from baseline of  total eye  fluorescein 
staining score as assessed by [CONTACT_394145] a 
similar manner as performed for  primary endpoint. All other secondary endpoints will 
also be analyzed in a similar manner. 
The other secondary efficacy endpoi nts are ordered as follows: corneal sum fluorescein 
staining score as assessed by [CONTACT_394132], OSDI , Schirmer’s test  
(unanesthetized), and TFBUT. Key secondary efficacy endpoint will be tested at alpha=0.05 (two- sided)  if primary 
endpoints are bot h significant at alpha=0.05. 
The other secondary efficacy endpoints will be tested  in order by [CONTACT_394146] . 
10.5 Analysis of Safety Data 
AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities  dictionary (the 
most recent version, ver. 24.1 or later). Frequencies, percentages, severity, and 
relationship to study drug of patients with TEAEs, serious TEAEs, and TEAEs causing 
premature study withdrawal and study drug discontinuation will be provided by [CONTACT_1570]. An AE is treatment emergent if it occurs or worsens after the first dose of study treatment. Furthermore, frequencies of occurrence will be given of patients with TEAEs by [CONTACT_9313]; by [CONTACT_6657]; by [CONTACT_9313], preferred term , and maximal severity; by [CONTACT_394147], Inc.

described in the HIPAA, World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki, FDA 21 
CFR Part 50.25, ICH GCP, and in accordance with any local regulations. The 
Investigator is responsible for the preparation, content, and IRB/IEC/REC approval of the 
ICF. The ICF  must be approved by [CONTACT_977] -designated IRB/IEC/REC and be 
acceptable to  KRI or its designee  prior to their use . 
The ICF must be written in a language fully comprehensible to the prospective patient. 
The written patient ICF will explain the objectives of the study and its potential risks and benefits. The information included on the ICF must be provided to the patient both 
verbally and in writing whenever possible and in a manner deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_5040]/IEC/REC. Patients must be given ample opportunity to read the information and inquire about details of the study. The Investigator must be satisfied that the patient has 
understood the information provided before written consent is obtained. If there is any 
doubt as to whether the patient has understood the written and verbal information, the patient must not be allowed to enter the study. 
If a patient agrees to participate, he or she will be asked to sign and date an ICF, the 
original copy of which will be kept by [CONTACT_737]. A copy of the signed ICF will be given to the patient. Information documenting the informed consent procedure will be 
recorded in the patient’s medical records (i.e., source document), and the original signed 
ICF must be made available to the study monitor for inspection.

11.6 Study Monitoring  
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure that the study is conducted in 
accordance with the protocol, ICH /FDA GCP s, applicable regulatory requirements, 
HIPAA, and the current Declaration of Helsinki. Valid data are to be entered into the 
eCRFs . 
To achieve this objective, the monitor’s duties are to aid the Investigator and, at the same 
time, the sponsor in the maintenance of accurate, complete, legible, well-organized, and 
easily retrievable data . The moni tor will review the protocol with the Investigator. In 
addition, the monitor will explain the Investigator ’s reporting responsibilities and all 
applicable regulations concerning the clinical evaluation of the study drug. 
The Investigator will permit the re presentatives of the sponsor to monitor the study as 
frequently as the sponsor deems is necessary to determine that data recording and 
protocol adherence are acceptable. The eCRFs  and related source documents will be 
reviewed in detail by [CONTACT_112100], in accordance with relevant standard operating procedures, ICH GCP  guidance, and FDA GCP regulations. This includes 
results of tests performed as a requirement for partic ipation in this study and any other 
medical records required to confirm information contained in the e CRFs , such as past 
medical history and secondary diagnoses. The Investigator and staff will be expected to cooperate with the monitor and provide any missing information, whenever possible. 
All monitoring activities will be reported and archived . In addition, monitoring visits will 
be documented at the investigational site by [CONTACT_76775]- specific 
monitoring log. 
11.7 Case Report Form  
All pati ent data generated during the study will be recorded on the eCRF . 
The Investigator will ensure that all data are entered promptly, legibly, completely, 
accurately and conform to source documents, in accordance with specific instructions accompanying the eC RFs, designed specifically for this study and supplied by [CONTACT_394151]. 
The representatives of the sponsor will only consider the eCRFs  to be complete after they 
are reviewed and signed by [CONTACT_737] , indicating his/her assurance of the accuracy 
of all recorded data. It is expected that the Investigator and staff will cooperate with the 
monitoring team and provide missing data in a timely manner. 
11.8 Verification Procedures  
In fulfillment of their obligations to the sponsor and to verify compliance with this 
protocol, ICH GCP  guidance, and FDA GCP regulations, the Investigator will permit the 
representatives of the sponsor, the IRBs /IECs /RECs , the monitor, and regulatory 
authorities to have direct access to the patien t’s medical records.

November 22, 2021 Page 77 of 82 It is the Investigator ’s obligation to ensure documentation of all relevant data in the 
patient ’s medical record, eCRFs , and on study forms, when applicable, according to 
procedures provided in the protocol and/or supplemental instruct ions. 
The Investigator will maintain a Patient  Identification Code List to enable unambiguous 
identification of the patient s (patient names and corresponding subject codes). The 
Patient  Identification Code List is an essential document and as such must be maintained 
according to the ICH GCP guidelines . 
11.9 Retention of  Records  
All documentation pertaining to the study will be retained by [CONTACT_394152] U S FDA regulations and the ICH GCP guidance document. 
The representatives of the sponsor will provide each Investigator with a study file, which 
will be used to file the Investigator’s Brochure , protocol, drug accountability records , 
correspondence with the IRB /IEC  and the sponsor, and other study-related documents. 
The Investigator agrees to keep records and those documents that include (but are not 
limited to) the identification of all participating patient s, medical records, study -specific 
source documents, source worksheets,  all original signed and dated ICFs , copi[INVESTIGATOR_394129] , query responses, and detailed records of drug disposition, to enable evaluations 
or audits from regulatory authorities and the sponsor or its designees.

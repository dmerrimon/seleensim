1.Statement of Purpose: State the scientific aim(s) of the study, or the hypotheses to be tested. 
TCORS menthol Pi[INVESTIGATOR_291482] (tobacco vs menthol) on reward/appeal, 
harshness/irritation and nicotine delivery from e-cigarettes containing nicotine (36mg/ml nicotine salt vs 
36mg/ml free base nicotine e-liquids) in adult menthol smokers. 
Primary Aim: Examine the influence of menthol flavor (when compared to a control tobacco flavor) 
on the effects of nicotine (freebase vs salt) on harshness/irritation and reward among menthol 
smokers. Participants will rate irritation/harshness using the General Labeled Magnitude Scale 
(gLMS)1, reward (liking and wanting of drug effects) using the Revised Drug Effects Questionnaire 
(DEQ) 2 and liking/disliking of e-cigarette flavor using the Labeled Hedonic Scale (LHS)3. We 
hypothesize that menthol’s effects on reduction of irritation will be greater following exposure to 
freebase nicotine e-liquids, when compared with nicotine salt. We also hypothesize that menthol 
when combined with nicotine salts will produce greater reward than when combined with freebase 
nicotine. 
Secondary Aim: Examine the influence of menthol flavor on the effects of nicotine (freebase vs salt) 
stimulation, craving reduction, and alleviation of nicotine withdrawal. Participants will rate nicotine 
withdrawal and stimulation using the Revised DEQ and cigarette craving using the gLMS.  
Exploratory Aim: Examine nicotine delivery following exposure to nicotine salt vs freebase nicotine 
exposure in combination with flavors (tobacco or menthol) by [CONTACT_291534] 5 min 
prior and 5, 15, 30, 45, and 55 minutes after nicotine and flavor exposure via e-cigarettes
K01 metabolism study
Eighty-Five African Americans (43 F,42 M) who smoke and have experience with e-cigarettes will 
participate in a double-blind, randomized, cross-over study across two experimental sessions. 
Following overnight abstinence from combustible tobacco products (CO≤10 ppm), participants will be 
randomly assigned to receive an e-cigarette with menthol flavor or control tobacco flavor (both in a 
concentration of 5% nicotine) on two separate days. Each session will consist of 1 puffing bout (10 
puffs, 3 sec each puff, 30 sec puff interval) followed by 2 hours of abstinence, then 60 minutes of ad 
libitum e-cigarette use. The specific aims are: 
Aim 1: Investigate the relationship of menthol flavor (vs tobacco flavor) and nicotine metabolite 
ratio (NMR) on nicotine pharmacokinetics and subjective effects during directed e-cigarette 
administration in African Americans who smoke. We hypothesize that during the menthol exposure 
session participants will have higher plasma nicotine levels compared to the tobacco flavor exposure 
session. We hypothesize that NMR is negatively associated with nicotine plasma levels during the 
tobacco flavor exposure sessions. Lastly, we hypothesize that participants will have a larger reduction 
of cigarette craving in the menthol compared to tobacco session. Primary outcomes: plasma nicotine 
boost, nicotine area under the curve. Secondary outcome: cigarette craving. Exploratory outcomes: 
other subjective effects such as liking of e-cig taste. Gender differences will be explored for all 
outcomes.
Aim 2: Elucidate the relationship between menthol flavor (vs tobacco flavor) and NMR on 
nicotine pharmacokinetics and subjective effects during e-cigarette ad libitum use in African 
Americans who smoke. We hypothesize that participants will take more puffs during the menthol 
session compared to the tobacco session. Additionally, we hypothesize that participants will titrate their 
nicotine intake and have similar nicotine plasma levels for both flavor exposure sessions. Furthermore, 
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 8/3/2021
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 8/3/2021Page 3 of 36we hypothesize that NMR will be positively associated with nicotine delivery (amount of e-liquid used x 
nicotine e-liquid concentration) for both flavor sessions. Lastly, we hypothesize that participants will 
have a larger reduction of cigarette craving in the menthol compared to tobacco session. Primary 
outcomes: plasma nicotine boost, nicotine area under the curve. Secondary outcomes: measure of 
nicotine delivered to participant and cigarette craving. Exploratory outcomes: number of puffs and 
subjective effects. Gender differences will be explored for all outcomes.

support the expectation of obtaining useful scientific data.
TCORS Menthol Pi[INVESTIGATOR_291483] 90% of lung cancer cases and 500,[ADDRESS_355755] lower cessation rates than non-menthol cigarette smokers 6. 
Electronic(e-) cigarette devices, which have been shown to be acutely less harmful than cigarettes7, 
may serve as harm reduction tools 8. Smokers transitioning to e-cigarettes completely may reduce 
the health burdens associated with tobacco use disorder4.  Given that smoking is reinforced by 
[CONTACT_188282]9, it is critical to understand which form of nicotine in e-cigarettes is important 
to established menthol smokers and will aid in their transition to e-cigarettes.
Pod e-cigarette devices such as the JUUL have surged in popularity in the past year 10 and 
introduced nicotine salts into the e-cigarette/e-liquid market. Prior to this entrance, freebase nicotine 
was the only form of nicotine found in e-liquids. Compared to nicotine salts, freebase nicotine is 
thought to cause greater irritation/harshness at high doses 11,12. In addition, e-cigarette companies 
have suggested that nicotine salts deliver more nicotine to the user than freebase nicotine 13,14. 
However, we lack empi[INVESTIGATOR_291484]. Further, e-cigarette/e-liquid companies 
market nicotine salts in e-liquids as an avenue for established smokers to transition to e-cigarettes. 
However, the rewarding effects of nicotine salts vs freebase nicotine have not been tested in 
smokers. 
     Flavors are known to play a significant role in increasing the appeal of tobacco and nicotine 
products15–17. Menthol is one such flavor which is present in both e-cigarettes that contain freebase 
nicotine and those that contain nicotine salts.  Menthol is thought to reduce the harshness and Study Quarter 1 Quarter 2 Quarter  3 Quarter 4

nicotine present in e-liquids because, as discussed earlier, nicotine freebase and nicotine salt may 
have differential irritant properties. Furthermore, given that previous studies have shown that 
irritation/harshness of e-liquids negatively correlates with reward/appeal21, menthol may also have 
divergent effects on reward of freebase nicotine and nicotine salt e-liquids. Therefore, this proposal 
seeks to investigate the effect of menthol flavor on nicotine salt vs freebase nicotine e-liquids on 
irritation/harshness, reward and nicotine delivery in adult smokers. Since the appeal of mentholated 
nicotine products may be particularly relevant for menthol smokers, who are also known to have 
more difficulty quitting smoking6,22, we will conduct this examination in menthol smokers
K01 Metabolism Study
The overall goal of this proposal is to understand the relationship between menthol e-liquid flavor (vs 
tobacco e-liquid flavor) and nicotine metabolite ratio (NMR) on plasma pharmacokinetic parameters of 
nicotine and subjective effects in African Americans who smoke. This proposal will utilize two lab-based 
e-cigarette exposure paradigms: (A) directed e-cigarette administration and (B) e-cigarette ad libitum 
use. The following aims will be investigated: (1): Investigate the relationship of menthol flavor(vs 
tobacco flavor) and NMR on nicotine pharmacokinetics and subjective effects during directed e-
cigarette administration and (2): Elucidate the relationship between menthol flavor and NMR on nicotine 
pharmacokinetics and subjective effects during e-cigarette ad libitum use.
   African Americans are disproportionately burdened with tobacco-related health diseases 
compared to other racial groups in the US 23,24. African Americans who smoke are more likely to 
develop lung cancer compared to smokers of other ethnic/racial groups25,26. These health disparities 
exist even though African Americans are more likely to be light smokers (smoke less than 10 cigarettes 
per day)27,28 and less likely to be daily smokers 29,30. African Americans also take in more nicotine when 
smoking compared to White people who smoke 31. The more intense smoking by [CONTACT_291535] 80% of African Americans who smoke are menthol smokers5,32. 
Menthol has cooling and analgesic properties via the transient receptor potential channels 33,34, which 
may reduce irritation from tobacco smoke and nicotine 18,[ADDRESS_355756] higher 
nicotine dependence 5,36–[ADDRESS_355757] slower oxidative metabolism of nicotine and slower N-glucuronidation than White people who 
smoke45. However, since 80% of African Americans who smoke, smoke menthol cigarettes, it is unclear 
if the effect on nicotine metabolism in African Americans is the result of menthol exposure. 
Furthermore, there are few studies that have investigated the differential impact of menthol on nicotine 
metabolism within the African American population. Additionally, It has been shown that females who 
smoke are more likely to smoke menthol cigarettes compared to men, however gender differences 
within Black people who smoke is understudied46. 
     Electronic (e)-cigarettes are an ideal system for examining the inhaled effects of menthol on 
nicotine metabolism in African Americans who smoke. E-cigarettes are battery operated devices 
that heat e-liquids containing nicotine, flavors and other constituents such as propylene glycol and 
glycerin 47. E-cigarettes have a similar route of nicotine administration to cigarettes and there are similar 
habitual smoking-related behaviors (hand to mouth movements)8. A previous clinical intervention study 
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 8/3/2021
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 8/3/2021Page 5 of 36conducted suggested that  menthol in cigarettes reduces nicotine metabolism in White and African 
Americans who smoke 48. Further supporting menthol’s potential role on nicotine metabolism, a survey 
study that collected NMR in White, Filipi[INVESTIGATOR_291485] a slower metabolism than those who smoked non-menthol cigarettes 
49,50However, given that cigarettes contain hundreds of chemicals, e-cigarettes are an ideal tobacco 
product to test the impact of menthol on nicotine metabolism. Additionally, there have been limited 
examinations of the influence of e-cigarettes in African Americans who smoke. To our knowledge, there 
are only two outpatient studies that experimentally examined toxicant exposure and subjective effects 
of e-cigarettes among African Americans51,52. There are no lab-based experimental e-cigarette 
administration studies that investigate the impact of menthol on the pharmacokinetic effects of nicotine 
via e-cigarettes within an in African American sample. African Americans are underrepresented in 
tobacco research even though they carry a disproportionate burden of tobacco related diseases. 
Intentional efforts are needed to correct this. Therefore, this proposal will recruitment African Americans 
who smoke which will aid in reducing tobacco-related health burdens in African Americans and benefit 
overall public health.  
   Tobacco Regulatory Impact of Proposed Research: This proposal will provide additional scientific 
data to inform regulation of tobacco products by [CONTACT_291536]’s Behavior and Addiction scientific 
interest areas and focus on Africans Americans which represent a vulnerable population.  Behavior – 
this proposal seeks to understand the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to use of menthol 
tobacco products in African Americans. Addiction - this application will understand the impact of 
menthol on nicotine metabolism and dependence in individuals who smoke. Vulnerable population -
this application could aid in reducing tobacco-related health burdens in African Americans which would 
benefit overall public health. 
The scientific premise for this proposal is to address critical gaps in menthol flavor research by 
[CONTACT_291537] e-cigarettes 
among African Americans who smoke.

Experimental design:  This proposal seeks to elucidate the differences in reward/appeal, 
harshness/irritation, nicotine delivery, preference and impact of menthol flavor (compared to control 
tobacco flavor) between nicotine salt vs free base nicotine e-liquids. Thirty adult menthol smokers 
(15 male; 15 female) will participate in a double-blind, randomized, cross-over study across three 
experimental sessions. For the first two sessions, each participant will be randomly assigned to 
receive nicotine salt or freebase nicotine (both in a concentration of 36mg/ml) on two separate days 
(see Table 1). Freebase nicotine e-liquid at concentration of 36mg/ml has been used previously  in

concentrations used in nicotine salt e-liquids/e-cigarette pod devices 55,56.  Following overnight 
abstinence from combustible tobacco products (CO≤10 ppm), participants will be exposed to the 
assigned form of nicotine in combination with two flavor conditions (tobacco and menthol) in a 
counterbalanced randomized order. Each exposure will consist of 2 2-sec puffs  and will be 
separated by a 60-minute washout period (see Table 2). 
iSaliva nicotine/ cotinine is an exploratory outcome and nicotine/cotinine levels will be assessed using 
saliva samples obtained 10 times per session (5 min prior to and 5, 15, 30, 45, and 55 minutes after the 
onset of puff1, and 5, 15, 30, and 45 minutes after the onset of puff2). Assessing the nicotine/cotinine 
levels will determine if there are pharmacokinetic differences between nicotine salts vs freebase 
nicotine. After completing the first two e-cigarette exposure sessions, the same thirty adult menthol 
smokers (15 female, 15 male) will undergo overnight abstinence from combustible tobacco and nicotine 
products and participant in a 60-minute choice e-cigarette self-administration session. 
During the third session, each participant will then be exposed to the same e-liquids they were exposed 
to during the two experimental sessions.  During the third session participants can freely self-administer 
any of the four e-liquids in an e-cigarette pod device (see Table 3). Participants will be left alone in the 
room to use all four of the e-cigarettes in any order or frequency they choose (Table 1). The third 
session will be video recorded. This session will be double blinded but to ensure participants distinguish 
each e-cigarette from each other, the e-cigarettes will be labeled with letters A, B, C, D randomly by a 
research assistant who is not conducting the study or coding the videos. This labeling will also be 
helpful for the video coders so they can distinguish e-cigarettes. E-liquids will be measured before and 
after the session. Two research assistants will independently code the video-tapes for puffing 
behaviors. Heart rate and blood pressure will be monitored throughout the session for safety, and 
participants will be told that they can stop anytime if they feel uncomfortable. Per the current practice of 
[CONTACT_30327]-Sarin’s research group, participants will be trained on how to puff the e-cigarettes, prior to 
the self-administration session. Training will be conducted using e-cigarettes that contain the base 
liquid of 50% propylene glycol(PG)/50% vegetable glycerin(VG).
The third session will be videotaped to ensure experimenter reliability, and to review individual 
participant’s vapi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. The commercially available Suorin iShare ™ and commercially available e-liquids 
will be used for our studies. The Suorin iShare ™ is a refillable pod system e-cigarette device 
composed of a battery without voltage control and a refillable pod that contains the e-liquid, mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_291487]. It is among one of the pod e-cigarette devices that are used widely57,58. Participants will not be 
allowed to keep the device. One month after the third session, participants will receive a follow up 
phone call to assess any health symptoms via a health assessment list, fatigue and shortness of 
breath.
For the safety of participants, we will add plexiglass dividers in the rooms where experimental sessions 
take place to limit contact [CONTACT_291538]. To limit in-person interactions during 
experimental sessions, we will give instructions and communicate to participants from another location 
remotely using a 2-way audio system. Hand sanitizer will be available, and participants will be asked to 
wear gloves for the duration of the lab session. All devices and areas will be sanitized before and after 
each participant. These changes have been added to the protocol and consent.

nicotine pharmacokinetics and subjective effects during directed e-cigarette 
administration. 
Experimental Design: Aim 1 focuses on the directed e-cigarette administration procedure. 
Saliva NMR will be assessed at intake appointment and will be a continuous measure in this 
study59,60. Following overnight abstinence from combustible tobacco products (CO≤10 ppm), 
African Americans who smoke will participant in a double-blind, counterbalanced and 
randomized e-cigarette exposure laboratory study where they will receive two e-liquid flavors 
(menthol, tobacco) with a fixed nicotine salt concentration in e-cigarettes (5%) on two separate 
days (one flavor condition per session). The directed e-cigarette administration procedure will 
consist of 1 fixed-puffing bout (puffing bout=10 puffs, 3 sec each puff, 30 sec puff interval) as 
done previously by [CONTACT_139520], [CONTACT_30327]-Sarin 61. Per the procedures conducted by [CONTACT_148783]-
mentor [CONTACT_60174]’s research group 62,63, plasma nicotine levels will be assessed at baseline 
and  5, 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes after nicotine exposure via e-liquids during the directed e-
cigarette administration procedure. Heart rate and blood pressure will be measured at 5, 15 
and 30 minutes after the final puff. Participants will rate irritation/harshness, coolness, cigarette 
craving, e-cigarette craving, liking of e-cig taste, reward/appeal of e-cig, nicotine withdrawal 
and stimulation at baseline, 5 and 15 min after nicotine concentration exposure. Participants 
will be told that they can stop anytime if they feel uncomfortable. Independent variables: sex 
(male or female), nicotine metabolite ratio, flavor (menthol, tobacco), Dependent variables: 
primary outcomes- plasma nicotine boost, nicotine area under the curve; secondary outcomes- 
cigarette craving; exploratory outcomes- reward/appeal of e-cigs, e-cig craving, 
irritation/harshness, coolness, nicotine withdrawal, stimulation, liking of e-cig taste. We will 
explore gender differences for all outcomes.

Assessments
1. General Labeled Magnitude Scale (gLMS)(experimental sessions)1: For TCORS Menthol pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], 
gLMS ratings will be obtained 5, 15, 30, 45, and 55 minutes after each puff during lab 1 and lab 
2. Participants will rate coolness, irritation/harshness, cigarette and e-cigarette craving using the 
gLMS which is a category ratio scale with 7 semantic labels: “no sensation”, “barely detectable”, 
“weak”, “moderate”, “strong”, “very strong”, and “strongest imaginable”. The labels are positioned 
quasi-logarithmically according to their empi[INVESTIGATOR_291489]. The gLMS 
will be displayed on a monitor via a custom LabView® program, and participants will make their 
ratings using a mouse. Ratings are numerically transformed and then used for statistical analyses.

of lab sessions.
2. Labeled Hedonic Scale (LHS)(experimental sessions)3 : For TCORS Menthol pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], liking of e-
cigarette taste will be assessed 5 min after each flavor exposure using the LHS scale. The LHS 
is a bipolar scale with “neutral” in the middle and 5 symmetrical semantic labels: “like/dislike 
slightly”, “like/dislike moderately”, “like/dislike very much”, “like/dislike extremely”, “most 
liked/disliked imaginable”, positioned on the scale according to their semantic magnitude. The 
LHS yields ratio-level data on the magnitude of liking/disliking of sensation equivalent to that 
produced by [CONTACT_291539] (ME). This scale will also be displayed on a computer screen 
as above and numerically transformed. 
For K01 metabolism study, liking of e-cig taste will be assessed at baseline, 5 min and 15 min 
after nicotine exposure during the directed puffing section of lab sessions.
3. E-cig Effects (Adapted from Drug Effects Questionnaire (DEQ61)(experimental sessions): A 
modified version of the Drug Effects Questionnaire  will be used in which participants will rate 
acute responses to the e-cig on a 0 to 100 mm scale, from “not at all” to “extremely.” 5, 15, 30, 
45, and 55 minutes after each puffing, we will assess liking/wanting of drug effects (average of “I 
feel good e-cig effects”, “I want more of that e-cig I received”, “I feel the e-cig strength” and “I like 
the e-cig effect”), stimulant effects (average of “I feel energized” and “I feel high”), and nicotine 
withdrawal (average of “I feel sleepy”, “I feel angry”, “I feel irritable”, “I am having difficulty 
concentrating”, “I feel restless” and “I feel hungry”). 
For K01 metabolism study, reward/appeal of e-cigs, nicotine withdrawal and stimulation will be 
assessed at baseline, 5 and 15 min after nicotine exposure during the directed puffing section of 
lab sessions.
4. Carbon Monoxide (CO) levels (experimental sessions): At intake we will assess recent smoking and 
participants with ≥10ppm will be included in the study for both studies. For lab sessions for both 
studies, CO levels in exhaled breath will be measured using a MicroCO breath CO monitor and 
levels of ≤10 ppm will be used to ensure abstinence prior to the experimental sessions. 
5. Urine Cotinine levels: At intake for both studies, urine samples will be assessed with Alere iScreen 
OFD Cotinine urine test to verify eligibility. 
6. Salivary nicotine and cotinine levels for TCORS menthol pi[INVESTIGATOR_799](experimental sessions): 
Saliva nicotine and cotinine levels will be monitored using saliva samples obtained 10 times per 
session (5 min prior to and 5, 15, 30, 45, and 55 minutes after the onset of puff1, and 5, 15, 30, 
and 45 minutes after the onset of puff 2). To try to avoid contamination from buccal nicotine, 
participants will be asked to rinse their mouths prior to providing each sample. These levels will 
be used for correlational analyses with behavioral measures and will be determined using LC/MS 
techniques at the core laboratory of the YCSTP.
7.Saliva nicotine metabolite ratio or NMR (trans 3’-hydrocotinine/ cotinine) for K01 
metabolism study will be assessed through Yale TCORS. To try to avoid contamination 
from buccal nicotine, participants will be asked to rinse their mouths prior to providing 
each sample
8. Asthma Control Test(Intake): At intake for both studies, participants will be asked to rate their 
asthma symptoms on a 1-5 scale, from “all of the time” to “none of the time”. This five question 
health survey is used to measure asthma control in individuals 12 years and older
9. Fatigue(all appointments): At all appointments for both studies, we will use the 7-item PROMIS 
measure of fatigue which rates fatigue from 1=”never” to 5=”always”..
10. Shortness of Breath (all appointments): At all appointments for both studies, we will use the 5-
item PROMIS measure of dyspnea which rates shortness of breath from 1-10. Items include: 
shortness of breath in general, intensity of shortness of breath, frequency of shortness of breath 
and duration of shortness of breath.

will be assessed to monitor health status at baseline and throughout the study at each in-person 
visit. Heart rate and blood pressure will be assessed. Pulse oximetry is the measurement of the 
oxygen in the blood.  
For the K01 metabolism study, heart rate and blood pressure will be assessed at baseline 5, [ADDRESS_355759] (all appointments): For both studies, we will also monitor checklist 
of health symptoms (e.g., headaches, dizziness, fainting, nausea, diarrhea) and severity of 
these symptoms that could be related to nicotine exposure/vapi[INVESTIGATOR_291491]-person visit.
  
14. Demographic Information (At Intake):  For both studies ,age, race, marital status, educational and 
occupational levels and medical history will be assessed with interviews and self-report forms. 
15. Nicotine Dependence (At Intake): We will use the 8-item PROMIS measure of nicotine 
dependence developed for cigarettes [ADDRESS_355760] validated for e-cigs 65, which shows 
internal consistency & measurement invariance across sex and race. 
16. Tobacco Use History Questionnaire (At Intake): For both studies, self-reports will be obtained from 
all participants; questions will be benchmarked to the NIDA PATH data. 
17. Risk perceptions of e-cigs and cigarettes: For both studies we will assess baseline risk 
perceptions of e-cigs and cigarettes. 
18.Flavor use history: For both studies we will assess the use of e-cig and cigarette flavors at 
intake.
19. Social determinants of health measures for K01 metabolism study will include assessments on 
employment status, education level, income, homeownership, experiences of discrimination, 
perceived neighborhood disadvantage, including problems (e.g., traffic, safety) and social 
cohesion and trust (e.g., connections, shared values, and willingness to help among neighbors) 
food security, utility needs, housing instability, transportation problems. These socioeconomic 
measures have been shown to be important predictors for tobacco use behaviors 66. 
20. Timeline Follow Back Interview(all appointments)67,68: For both studies, we will use of cigarettes, 
little cigars and e-cigs (with or without nicotine) will be examined using a 30-day TLFB at intake 
and experimental sessions. Test-retest reliability is high in adult smokers, and we have used it 
with younger smokers.
21. The amount of e-liquid used from each e-cigarette will be measured before and after the e-
cigarette self-administration session for both studies. 
22. Puffing behavior will be assessed by [CONTACT_291540], and time to first puff for each of the 
four e-cigarettes in the self-administration session for both studies. Two research assistants will 
independently code the video-tapes for puffing behaviors which will then be averaged across 
raters.
23.Physical function scale will select individuals who have good physical functioning.  As part of the 
medical history, the following 4 PROMIS questions will be asked: Are you able to do chores 
such as vacuuming or yard work? Are you able to go up and down stairs at a normal pace? Are 
you able to go for a walk of at least 15 minutes? Are you able to run errands and 
shop?  Response options for these questions are “Without any difficulty”, “With a little difficulty”, 
“With some difficulty”, “With much difficulty” and “Unable to do so” (Beidelschies et al 2019). To 
be eligible, participants must respond “Without any difficulty” to all 4 questions. We assess this 
for both studies at every appointment.
24. Urine drug and pregnancy tests: Urine drug screen will assess recent drug use at intake for both 
studies. If participants test positive for any drugs except marijuana and drugs they are not 
prescribed at the in-person intake appointment, they will not be paid for the visit and will have 
the opportunity to reschedule this appointment one time.  Urine drug screen assesses 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], marijuana, methadone, cocaine, methamphetamine, morphine, MDMA, 
oxycodone, barbiturates, buprenorphine, amphetamine phencyclidine, methadone metabolites,

participants at baseline and every vapi[INVESTIGATOR_291492]. In addition, female enrollees will be verbally asked about their pregnancy risk (such as 
unprotected sex or a missed menstrual period).  
25. Plasma nicotine levels for K01 metabolism study will be assessed using blood samples obtained 
at baseline and 5, 15, 30, 45, 60 minutes after nicotine exposure during the directed e-cigarette 
portion and plasma nicotine levels will be assessed using blood samples obtained at baseline 
and 15, 30, 60 minutes after nicotine exposure during ad-lib session. 60 ml of blood will be 
drawn at each e-cigarette exposure through insertion of an intravenous catheter during e-
cigarette directed administration session (total of 120ml for all laboratory session in study or 8 
tablespoons) which is below the IRB guidelines of [ADDRESS_355761] and the area under the curve. These levels will be determined using LC/MS 
techniques through the Yale TCORS Lab and Analytical Core.   
26. Amount of nicotine delivered to participants will be assessed for K01 metabolism study. The 
amount of e-liquid in pods will be measured before and after the ad-lib e-cigarette exposure 
period. We will then multiply the amount of e-liquid used by [CONTACT_291541] e-
liquid (5%) to calculate the amount of nicotine delivered to the participants62.

9.How will eligibility be determined, and by [CONTACT_20898]? 
Participants will have the option to sign informed consent via RedCap, through mail or in-person 
and complete initial assessments including medical and substance use histories for intake remotely 
or in-person. If eligible following administration of remote intake, participants will come in for a very 
brief visit in which biochemical measures will be collected: urine drug and pregnancy tests, breath 
CO, urine cotinine levels, saliva NMR, pulse oximetry readings, lung spi[INVESTIGATOR_038], heart rate and 
blood pressure. If participants do not wish or do not have the internet capabilities to participate in 
remote intake, the participants can also sign informed consent and assessments in person at 
Connecticut Mental Health Center.
During the duration of the study, participants will be given a questionnaire daily to assess COVID 
symptoms they may be experiencing. This survey is in line with Yale’s Return to Campus Protocol 
(https://ypps.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/StayHome.pdf). If yes is endorsed for any symptom, the 
research team will follow up via phone call and ask participant to describe symptoms and rate symptom 
severity. For any symptoms described as severe and unrelated to other causes (i.e. headache for 
someone who is abstaining from their normal caffeine, muscle pain related to a workout, symptoms of 
seasonal allergies), the research team will evaluate the symptoms with a study physician. Based on 
physician recommendation, study participation will be paused until a negative COVID test can be 
produced. All participants will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_291542]/or get a COVID test under these 
conditions. This COVID symptom check survey will be started the day prior to the first in person lab 
session and will continue through completion of the ad-lib period. Participants will not be allowed to 
complete in person sessions unless the COVID symptom checks are completed. Once participant 
arrive at their appointment location, a COVID screening (including temperature and symptom check) 
will be conducted as part of their appointment.  If a subject answers “yes” to any COVID screening 
question or has a temperature of ≥100˚F, their appointment must be discontinued, they must be 
escorted from the building to a separate isolation tent outside the facility (if appointment is at CMHC), 
and instructed to immediately contact [CONTACT_291543] ([PHONE_6050]). At satellite sites at which research staff are themselves conducting 
primary symptom screening outside the building as described above, participants will not be escorted to 
an isolation tent, but instructed to immediately contact [CONTACT_291544] ([PHONE_6050]).
If subject is suspected to be intoxicated at intake visit, a breathalyzer will be performed.  If the BAC 
level is > 0.05, we will ask the subject to remain in the clinic and we will repeat the breathalyzer 
periodically.  During this time, medical procedures (e.g. urine, etc.) may be done based on the 
judgement of the provider; no self-report type assessments will be administered.  The subject’s BAC 
level must be <0.[ADDRESS_355770] the clinic, otherwise a friend can be called, or other 
transportation can be arranged.
10.Risks:  Describe the reasonably foreseeable risks, including risks to subject privacy, discomforts, or 
inconveniences associated with subjects participating in the research. 
Experiencing nicotine withdrawal:  During the abstinence period prior to the e-cigarette lab exposure 
sessions in Aim 1, participants may experience symptoms of nicotine withdrawal, such as nicotine craving, 
mild anxiety, restlessness, irritability, difficulty concentrating, loss of energy and excessive hunger. These 
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 8/3/2021
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 8/3/2021Page 15 of 36are normal symptoms that people experience when they stop smoking and they can be uncomfortable, but 
they are not life threatening. 
Breath, saliva and urine collections:  Breath CO, saliva, and urine collections should add no risks other than 
those normally associated with these procedures. 
Blood Drawing (K01 Metabolism only): Drawing blood is a safe and standard medical procedure. 
Sometimes a bruise will occur at the puncture site and rarely a blood clot or infection will occur in the 
vein. Certain individuals may feel light-headed during venipuncture.
Intravenous Access: Insertion of an intravenous catheter involves risk for hematoma at the site of the 
venous puncture. Very rarely, venous puncture can also result in a blood clot or infection
Rating Scales and Assessments: These are all noninvasive and should add no risk. The major 
disadvantages are the time taken to complete them, and possible breach of confidentiality. 
Use of e-cigarette: Participants will be informed about the following Center for Disease Control (CDC) 
information about vapi[INVESTIGATOR_007]: There have been recent reported cases of severe pulmonary illness linked to 
‘vapi[INVESTIGATOR_007]’ or e-cigarette use. These cases included symptoms such as coughing, shortness of breath, 
chest pain, fever, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and/or abdominal pain. Some patients reported 
symptoms to have occurred over a few days and some reported to have occurred over a few weeks. 
Vapi[INVESTIGATOR_007]-related disorders have ranged from mild to severe with hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], intensive care with 
breathing machines and in some cases death. In most cases, but not all, people experiencing these 
symptoms were using cannabidiol (CBD) and marijuana (THC) e-liquids, and/or using e-cigarette 
devices and e-liquids that were mixed at home or purchased off market (such as purchasing an e-liquid 
or device on the street, not from a licensed retailer). Laboratory data show that Vitamin E Acetate, an 
additive in some THC-containing e-cigarette or vapi[INVESTIGATOR_291494].
The Center for Disease Control (www.cdc.gov) has issued the following information on vapi[INVESTIGATOR_007]: 
CDC and FDA recommend that people not use THC-containing e-cigarette, or vapi[INVESTIGATOR_007], products, 
particularly from informal sources like friends, family, or in-person or online dealers.
Vitamin E acetate should not be added to any e-cigarette, or vapi[INVESTIGATOR_007], products. Additionally, 
people should not add any other substances not intended by [CONTACT_291545], 
including products purchased through retail establishments.
Adults using nicotine-containing e-cigarette, or vapi[INVESTIGATOR_007], products as an alternative to cigarettes 
should not go back to smoking; they should weigh all available information and consider 
using FDA-approved smoking cessation medications. If they choose to use e-cigarettes as an 
alternative to cigarettes, they should completely switch from cigarettes to e-cigarettes and not 
partake in an extended period of dual use of both products that delays quitting smoking 
completely. They should contact [CONTACT_291546], including e-cigarettes, as well as if they have concerns about EVALI.
E-cigarette, or vapi[INVESTIGATOR_007], products (nicotine- or THC-containing) should never be used by [CONTACT_291547], 
young adults, or women who are pregnant.
Adults who do not currently use tobacco products should not start using e-cigarette, or vapi[INVESTIGATOR_007], 
products.
THC use has been associated with a wide range of health effects, particularly with prolonged 
frequent use. The best way to avoid potentially harmful effects is to not use THC-containing e-
cigarette, or vapi[INVESTIGATOR_007], products.
Persons engaging in ongoing cannabis use that leads to significant impairment or distress 
should seek evidence-based treatment by a healthcare professional.
Use of propylene glycol/ vegetable glycerin: E-cigarettes contain other chemicals besides nicotine 
including propylene glycol/vegetable glycerin. At this time, we do not know the risks associated with the 
propylene glycol/ vegetable glycerin that may be in e-liquids used in this study. However, there may be 
unforeseen risks (such as allergic reactions). We will be using e-liquids with propylene glycol/vegetable

session. Participants who report recent THC vapi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (within the last 90 days) will be monitored for 
EVALI symptoms, which are currently evaluated on our Health Assessment Checklist. Specifically, if a 
participant indicates EVALI symptoms (i.e. cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, 
stomach pain, diarrhea, fever, chills, or weight loss), the researcher will assess if the symptom is 
related and proximal to a non-EVALI cause (e.g. Nausea/vomiting related to food poisoning, Shortness 
of breath related to seasonal allergies). If a reasonable & proximal cause is identified, participant will 
continue with session. If not, participation will be deemed ineligible (if identified at intake) or withdrawn 
(at lab sessions). We will consult with study pulmonologist for any cases in which the etiology of 
symptoms is not apparent or is unclear. Additionally, lung spi[INVESTIGATOR_291495]. Participants who report THC vapi[INVESTIGATOR_291496]://www.yalemedicine.org/conditions/evali . All participants will have a physical exam( i.e. review of 
medical history, heart rate, blood pressure, lung spi[INVESTIGATOR_038], pulse oximetry) and be deemed healthy 
prior to participation and will continue to monitor their health closely during the study. Participants will 
be informed that if they experience any symptoms (cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea, 
vomiting, stomach pain, diarrhea, fever, chills, or weight loss) or have other concerns, that they should 
let us know and also let their doctor know right away. Any participants reporting mild or moderate

develop symptoms during the study without reasonable and proximal cause, they will be withdrawn, 
referred to their primary care physician, or other care as needed.
 
Additionally, in rare cases there have been reports of e-cigarettes exploding and causing serious injury 
to people. Evidence suggests that these explosions are battery related. To avoid a vape related 
explosion the research staff has implemented the following Food and Drug Administration 
recommendations: 1) The research staff will keep loose batteries in a case to prevent contact [CONTACT_291548], 2) The research staff will always charge the battery with the charger that the e-cigarette 
came with 3) The e-cigarettes will not be charged overnight or left unattended 4) The research staff will 
replace the e-cigarette battery if it becomes wet or damaged. Furthermore, acute exposure to e-
cigarette aerosol may result in mouth and throat irritation, dry cough at initial use and typi[INVESTIGATOR_291501].
Nicotine and flavor administration: Common side effects of nicotine include nausea, vomiting, heartburn, 
and elevated heart rate and blood pressure. Toxic doses of nicotine may cause abdominal pain, 
hypersalivation, diarrhea, dizziness, confusion, hearing and vision problems, syncope, seizures, 
hypotension, irregular pulse, and death. However, these toxic effects occur at doses [ADDRESS_355772] 
experience with tobacco products, including e-cigs, we will further mitigate the risk of these side effects. 
Furthermore, our adult sample will be those who are regular users of combustible tobacco and the e-
cigarette nicotine concentrations that will be used are in the range commonly used by [CONTACT_291549]. Nicotine intake during pregnancy may be associated with increased risk for spontaneous abortion, 
increased perinatal mortality and with low infant birth weights.  We will exclude women who are pregnant 
or nursing from this study. Menthol administration produces typi[INVESTIGATOR_291502] 8/3/2021
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 8/3/2021Page [ADDRESS_355773] been described in the literature following very high doses of menthol ingestion, 200 mg 
or more.  Menthol poisoning reported to cause ataxia, confusion, coma, nausea, and vomiting. 
However, these toxic effects occur at doses 20 to 30 times that which will be used in our studies. We 
are not aware of any toxic effects from the tobacco flavor being used in this study, but participants will 
be told that if they feel any adverse events or want to stop they are free to do so. We will also monitor 
for adverse events. 
Drug use: Participants will be asked about their current and past use of illicit "street" drugs at the intake 
to rule out substance abuse. If they are currently using drugs, they may not be eligible to participate. If 
at any time during their participation they report they want to hurt themselves or hurt anyone else, we 
will immediately direct them to appropriate authorities to ensure their safety.
Limits to confidentiality: All participants will be specifically told that we will not reveal any personal 
information collected as part of the research procedures, including their reported use of cigarettes, e-
cigarettes and other substance use history. However, there is always the possibility that participation in 
this study may make others, such as friends and family members, aware of their tobacco use status. They 
will be told that if they do not feel comfortable with this, then they should not participate in the project.  
They will also be told that if they report any information to us about abuse or homicidal/suicidal behavior, 
we will be required to report this information to the appropriate authorities. 
Lastly, any incidental clinical findings will be evaluated on a case by [CONTACT_291550]. This will be clearly stipulated in the consent forms.
Smoking and Vapi[INVESTIGATOR_291503]-19: Although scientific evidence is incomplete, some studies have 
suggested that use of e-cigarettes may add to a persons risk of getting COVID -[ADDRESS_355774] to take their

11.Minimizing Risks:  Describe the manner in which the above-mentioned risks will be minimized.
Risks Associated with Blood Drawing – (K01 Metabolism Study only)
To minimize risks associated with blood draws and IV-line insertion, experienced venipuncture-certified 
personnel will do all the blood-drawing procedures. Subjects will have approximately [ADDRESS_355775], Facebook, novelties (e.g. coasters, 
matchbooks, etc.) flyers in the community. At the initial intake session, potential participants will sign 
informed consent and complete initial assessments. Medical and substance abuse histories, urine drug 
and pregnancy tests, breath CO and urine cotinine levels will be obtained from all participants. If all the 
study criteria are met and consent is obtained, the research assistant will work with the participant to 
set up the experimental schedule.

All the procedures will follow the guidelines provided by [CONTACT_291552] 
(NACDA) guidelines for administration of drugs for research purposes71.  
Specifically, the NACDA recognizes that substance abuse research involving adults is vital to 
understanding factors contributing to the initiation, maintenance and cessation of substance use. In 
order to reduce risk they have requested that all research requiring administration of drugs should 
include 1) A serious and concerted effort to link these individuals to drug abuse treatment, 2) Inclusion 
of medical screener to screen for any medical issues and if needed conduct a physical exam  and 3) A 
thorough assessment of the risks entailed if participants are to be exposed to higher doses, rate of 
administration, and/or new route of administration than they would normally encounter by [CONTACT_291553]. 
 
This study presents greater than minimal risk given that we will be providing participants with an 
electronic cigarette in a lab. However, we will reduce risk by:
Obtaining consent from >21 year olds
Requiring that adults report experience with e-cigs.
Using well-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria to rule pre-existing medical conditions. 
Using study staff who have extensive expertise conducting tobacco research and working with adults 
and who are sensitive to the issues that may arise in working with combustible tobacco users.  
Monitor heart rate and blood pressure during experimental sessions
Protect right to privacy through coding of data and proper storage of research records.  
Obtain a certificate of confidentiality from NIH to further protect the research records of these 
participants.
Use the Yale TCORS Independent Data Safety Monitoring Board including experts in the field of 
tobacco use behaviors and challenge studies ([CONTACT_291565], FRCPC, Professor and Co-

This protocol presents a minor increase over minimal risk to the subjects and adverse events are not 
anticipated. In the unlikely event that such events occur, serious and unanticipated and related adverse 
events will be reported in writing within 48 hours to the Yale IRB and NIDA. The initial SAE report will 
be followed by [CONTACT_63664] a completed SAE report to both institutions. In the event that a participant 
either withdraws from the study or the investigator decides to discontinue a participant due to an SAE, 
the participant will be monitored by [CONTACT_21138] 1) a resolution 
is reached i.e., the problem requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_291507] 2) the SAE is determined to be clearly unrelated to the study intervention, or 3) the SAE 
results in death. Additionally, medical symptoms will be monitored throughout the study for any 
changes including symptoms associated with nicotine and EVALI (e.g., nausea, vomiting, rapid 
heartbeat, shortness of breath). All participants will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_291508] a study 
physician ([CONTACT_291568], a pulmonologist) as needed. Positive findings of a change in symptom 
to severe would trigger clinical review by [CONTACT_976] [INVESTIGATOR_291509] a physician or

Statistical analyses for TCORS Menthol Pi[INVESTIGATOR_16116]: Preliminary analyses will provide an overview of the 
data (e.g., randomization success, outcome distribution, missingness patterns). Outcome analyses will 
be intent-to-treat and using mixed-effects models. These models allow for different numbers of 
observations per subject, use all available data, and can handle missing-at-random data. If model 
assumptions will appear to be violated, we will transform the data or fit more flexible generalized linear 
or nonparametric mixed models. We will estimate effects for a larger study.
The mixed models will include gender (female, male) as a between-subject factor, flavor (menthol, 
tobacco), nicotine form (salt and freebase) as within-subject factors, and measurement time (time-within-
experimental session). The models will also include all possible interactions among nicotine form and 
flavor and adjust for the stratification variables (sex). We anticipate significant main effects of flavor on 
liking/wanting of drug effects and e-cigarette taste. In addition, we expect significant main effects of 
nicotine form on irritation/harshness. Similar models will be used for secondary outcomes (nicotine-
induced stimulation, craving and withdrawal). 
Statistical Analysis for K01 Metabolism Study: Preliminary analyses will provide an overview of the data 
(e.g., randomization success, outcome distribution, missingness patterns). Outcome analyses will be

per subject, use all available data, and can handle missing-at-random data. If model assumptions appear 
to be violated, we will transform the data or fit more flexible generalized linear or nonparametric mixed 
models. Aim 1 and Aim 2: The mixed models will include baseline NMR (continuous), time within lab 
(within-subject factor), flavor (menthol, tobacco; within-subject factor), their three-way interaction, all 
corresponding two-way interactions and main effects. The model will also adjust for the between-subject 
factor sex (female, male). We will use Bayesian information criterion (BIC) to select the best fitting 
correlation structure for the repeated measures within subject. We will use graphical methods and 
polynomial terms to investigate whether the relationship between NMR and outcomes is linear. Statistical 
training and support will be provided by [CONTACT_148783]-mentor [CONTACT_205630] who served as the Lead

TCORS Menthol Pi[INVESTIGATOR_291516] e-liquids used in this study are commercially available and we will obtain an ITP from 
the FDA.  We obtain all our e-liquid from American eLiquid Store. The e-liquid mixture (propylene glycol 
[PG], vegetable glycerin [VG] and tobacco and menthol will consist of a concentrated flavor liquid 
added to a base liquid which will consist of a commonly used ration of 50% PG and 50% VG. PG is the 
original base liquid and is believed to produce a throat sensation (“throat hit”) which mimics the feel of 
smoking a cigarette. VG is included to enhance the volume of vapor production, giving a greater 
sensory illusion of smoking. We will use 36mg/ml freebase nicotine and 36mg/ml nicotine salt e-liquid 
solutions. In order to ensure that we have adequate amount of e-liquid, of the same constituency, we 
will purchase large quantities of these solutions prior to starting these experiments which will be stored 
at and dispensed at John Pi[INVESTIGATOR_291517]. The commercially available Suorin iShare auto battery and 
Suorin iShare replacement pods will be used. This e-cigarette is similar in size and function to other 
commercially available more popular pod style devices. All of the e-liquids will be obtained from 
American eLiquid Store, which manufactures all its products in Wauwatosa, WI and reports being the 
first e-liquid manufacturer in the US to obtain the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 
9001:2008 and Current Good Manufacturing practices (cGMP) certification. A new e-cigarette device 
will be used for each subject, and new pods will be used for each experiment. Pods will be filled with e-
liquid mixtures at John Pi[INVESTIGATOR_291517].

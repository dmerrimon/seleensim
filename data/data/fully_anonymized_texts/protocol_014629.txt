3/Protocol BP41316, Version 5 PROTOCOL AMENDMENT, VERSION 5 
RATIONALE  
Protocol BP41316 has been amended to reduce the study burden for participants  and 
their caregivers, reduce the duration of study visits, and provide additional flexibility to 
schedule study visits and perform specific study assessments remotely . Changes to the 
protocol, along with a rationale for each change, are summarized below : 
•Changes t o reduce the study burden
–In Table 1, administration of Pediatric Quality of Life InventoryTM (PedsQL )
Family Impact Module has been removed to reduce study burden for
participants and caregivers.  Section 3 (Objectives and Endpoints)  has been
updated accordingly  and Section [IP_ADDRESS]  (Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 
[PedsQL ] Version 2.[ADDRESS_1185295] Scale) in the previous version of the
protocol has been removed.
–A new table (Table 2 Visit Scheduling Details) has been added to provide more
flexibility for participants, to enhance study feasibility, and to reduce burden for
caregivers by [CONTACT_852457].
–To provide more flexibility, footnote d has been added to Table 3 to clarify that
completion of in- clinic assessments can be done either  at baseline or on Day 1.
–Sections 1.3 (Schedule of Activities), 3 (Objectives and Endpoints), [IP_ADDRESS]
(Rationale for Response Biomarkers), and [IP_ADDRESS] (Response Biomarkers: Eye-Tracking and EEG Biomarkers) have been updated to remove part of the
electroencephalogram  (EEG)/e lectrooculogram  (EOG) assessments in order to
reduce the duration of the trial’s visits. Auditory EEG  tasks have been removed
from Pre -Baseline and Week 12 visits, and the saccadic peak velocity  (SPV)
task has been removed from Week  12.
–Section 1.3  (Schedule of Activities)  and Section [IP_ADDRESS] (Digital Biomarkers)
have been updated to reduce the time that participants and their support person
need to spend on the digital biomarker assessments, including  the following
changes : (1) removal of surveys from the smartphone app, except  the EuroQol
5 Dimension 5- Level Questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L); (2) remov al of one o f the four
active tasks from the smartphone app; (3) use of  the beacons is optional; and
(4)reduction of the frequency of at -home active tests from 7 per week
(i.e., once every day) to 3 per week (i.e., all tests once per week) .
–To reduce the burden on support person, Section 4.1 (Study Design),
Section 5.1 (inclusion criterion #2), and Appendix  1, Section [IP_ADDRESS] (Remote
Administration of Electronic Clinical Outcome Assessments) have been
updated to clarify that for support persons of high -functioning adult participants,
no on- site visits are necessary after the screening visit if all electronic clinical
outcome assessments (eCOA), interview, and forms are performed remotely.
RO7017773 —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
4/Protocol BP41316, Version 5 –To reduce the duration of site visits  and increase flexibility for both sites a nd
study participants, Appendix 1, Section [IP_ADDRESS] (Remote Administration of
Electronic Clinical Outcome Assessments) has been updated to clarify that allcaregiver - and patient -reported scales , forms , and interviews including the
Vineland- 3, Children’s Ya le-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale modified for
ASD (CY-BOCS -ASD), and  Clinical Global Impression  (CGI) assessments  may
be administered remotely at the participants’ home.
•Changes related to pharmacokinetics
–Footnote #11 in Table 1 and Section 8.5 (Pharmacokinetics) have been
updated following review of the initial pharmacokinetic (PK) data from 13 high -
functioning adult participants. In high- and low -functioning adult participants, the
PK sampling has been reduced on Day  1. Additionally, in low -functioning adult
participants only, the Week 2, 6- hour PK sample is optional. In adolescents, all
PK samples on Day 1 still remain mandatory until the 2nd Internal Monitoring
Committee (IMC) + Scientific Oversight Comm ittee (SOC) review.
–Section 8.5. (Pharmacokinetics) and f ootnote #[ADDRESS_1185296]/some food on Day 1
and Day 14 to ensure  accurate  capturing of the peak concentrations of
RO7017773 as emerging PK data suggests a tmax of approximately 2 hours
following a light meal .
–Footnote #8 in Table  1 has been updated with regards to postdose ECG
measurements on Day 1 and Day 14; ECG assessments at [ADDRESS_1185297] plasma concentrations forRO7017773 following a light meal. Therefore, ECG assessments will be
reduced to one timepoint postdose (2  hours) to capture peak effect on ECG
param eters.
•Changes to eligibility criteria
–Section 5.1 (Inclusion Criteria) has been updated to remove the Clinical GlobalImpression- Severity (CGI -S) scale as an inclusion criterion. This additional
criterion is not necessary to select the target study population as both core
symptoms are enriched by [CONTACT_852458] -based inclusion criteria.
Section 5.4 (Screen Failures) has also  been updated accordingly.
–Inclusion criterion #8 (Section 5.1 Inclusion Criteria) and Section [IP_ADDRESS]
(Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence, Second Edition) have been
updated regarding the possibility to use previous intelligence quotient  (IQ)
asses sments for adult participants.
–Section 5.2 (Exclusion Criteria) has been updated to clarify the eligibility ofsubjects with syndromic forms of autism spectrum disorder ( ASD) and genetic
alterations strongly associated with ASD.
–Sections 5.1 (Inclusion Criteria) and 4.2.1 (Rationale for Study Population) have
been updated to lower the inclusion threshold for the CY -BOCS -ASD to a total
score of at least 8 on the basis of new data indicating that an inclusion
RO7017773 —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
5/Protocol BP41316 , Version 5 threshold of 8 is suffi cient to recruit a study population with elevated level s of 
restricted and repetitive behaviors. With this change, the Sponsor aims to avoid 
exclusion of subjects with sufficiently high levels of restricted and repetitive 
behaviors that are suitable to mon itor these behaviors in the context of this 
study. Section 5.4 (Screen Failures) has also been updated to clarify that 
participants who meet the updated inclusion threshold are eligible to 
re-screening.  
Other changes
–Table 1 has been updated to move the ad ministration of the initial CGI -S clinical
interview from screening to pre -baseline. Section [IP_ADDRESS] and Table [ADDRESS_1185298]
been updated accordingly.
–It has been clarified that follow -up period will start from the Week  12 visit
(Table  1).
–Footnote #[ADDRESS_1185299] sufficient hair.
Section  8.8.1 (Mandatory Samples) has also been updated accordingly.
–Section 6.5.3 (Prohibited Therapy) has been updated to state  explicitly that
topi[INVESTIGATOR_052], felbamate, zonisamide , and  pregabalin  are prohibited in this study.
Appendix  6 has been updated accordingly.
–Section [IP_ADDRESS]  (Neurocognitive Battery ) and footnote #[ADDRESS_1185300].
–Section [IP_ADDRESS]  (Response Biomarkers: Eye -Tracking and Task EEG
Biomarkers ) has been updated to clarify that for low -functioning participants,
response biomarker assessments may be skipped if they are not able to
complete the full set of assessments.
Additional minor changes have been made to improve clarity and consistency. 
Substantial new information appears in Book An tiqua  italics . This amendment represents 
cumulative changes to the original protocol.

PROTOCOL NUMBER:  BP41316  
VERSION:  [ADDRESS_1185309]:  RO7017773 
PHASE:  II 
RATIONALE  
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder characterized 
by
 [CONTACT_737763]: impairments in social interaction and communication as well as presence of 
repetitive or restricted behaviors, interests, or activities. Core symptoms of ASD affecting 
domains of socialization, communication, and repetitive behavior are usually observed by [ADDRESS_1185310] with peers, 
and lack of social judgment. Abnormalities in communication include a delay in verbal language 
development, impaired expressive language, deficient language pragmatics, as well as 
stereotyped, repetitive, or idiosyncratic use of language. Stereotyped and repetitive behavior manifests as a preoccupation with stereotyped or restricted interests, adherence to routines, 
rigidity, perseverative and stereotyped behavior, motor mannerisms, preoccupation, or fascination 
with parts of items, and unusual visual exploration. In addition to these core deficits, patients with ASD suffer from a range of comorbid conditions, including irritability, depression or anxiety, 
attention deficits, obsessive compulsive symptoms, seizures, and sleep disruption. RO7017773 is 
a selective gamma -aminobutyric acid type  A, alpha 5 ( GABA
A-α5) subunit -containing receptor 
positive allosteric modulator (PAM). RO7017773 is being developed for the treatment of the two 
core domains of ASD: social communication deficits and restricted and repetitive behaviors 
(RRBs). RO7017773 has the potential to normalize gamma -aminobutyric acid (GABA) -ergic 
signaling in key brain regions implicated in ASD without the side effects of non -specific GABA 
modulators (e.g., benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651]).

and Wechsler Abbreviated Scale o f Intelligence (WASI -II) score ≥50.
STUDY DESIGN  
Approximately 105 participants with ASD (in order to have approximately  84 evaluable 
participants at study end) aged 15 to 45 years will be enrolled into the study. Participants will be 
 
RO7017773 —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
21/Protocol BP41316, Version 5 Access to treatment assignment information will follow the Sponsor’s standard procedures.  
PARTICIPANT POPULATI O N 
Male and female participants aged 15 to 45 years with ASD according to the Diagnostic and 
S
tatistical Manual for Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM -5) criteria who fulfill all the inclusion 
criteria listed below and for whom none of the exclusion criteria listed below apply will be included into the study.  
Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria  
Inclusion Criteria  
1. S
tudy participants or legal representatives should be able and willing to provide written 
informed consent or assent, as applicable and as per local requirements according to 
International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) and local regulations. Alternatively, a legally 
authorized representative m ust be able to consent for the participant according to ICH and 
local regulations and assent must be given whenever possible.  The ability to provide 
informed consent for each participant will be based on the Principal investigator’s clinical judgment.  
2. Availability of a parent or other reliable support person who is fluent in local language and 
has frequent and sufficient contact [CONTACT_6635]. The same person must agree to 
accompany the participant to all clinic visits and provide information about the participant’s 
behavior and symptoms and must agree to oversee the participant’s adherence with protocol -specified procedures and study medication dosing.  
• For support  persons of high -functioning adult participants, no on- site visits are 
necessary after the screening visit if all eCOA assessments, interview, and forms are 
performed remotely.  
 
Age 
3. Age 15 to 45 years, at the time of signing the informed consent or assent form 
Type of Participants and Disease Characteristics  
4. Male and female participants with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) according to the 
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM -5) criteria.  
• For transgender participants, the Investigator should consult with the Medical Monitor or 
delegate to assess potential safety concerns or interference with safety and efficacy 
testing. Transgender participants will be enrolled by [CONTACT_852460].  
Note: It is important that a high- confidence autism diagnosis has been established by [CONTACT_852461].  
5. Social Responsiveness Scale, Second Edition (SRS -2) (T -score)  ≥ 66. 
6. Wechsler Abbreviated Scale Intelligence second edition (WASI -II) or equivalent assessment 
≥ [ADDRESS_1185311] 12 months prior to screening (for adults within the last 5 
years prior to screening if the assessment was done at age 18 or older) . The proportion of 
low-functioning participants (IQ  ≥ 50 to 69) will be limited to 25% overall.  
• If a previous assessment is used, the Investigator should assess whether it has been performed by [CONTACT_852462].  
7. ASD or autism diagnosis confirmed by [CONTACT_713961] (ADOS -2), 
done by a certified rater at screening, or within the last [ADDRESS_1185312] moderate to severe repetitive behaviors as per Children’s Yale- Brown 
Obsessive Compulsive Scale modified for ASD (CY -BOCS- ASD) total score of at least 8 at 
screening.  
Weight  
9. Body mass index (BMI) within the range of 18.5 to 40 kg/m
2 (inclusive).  
 
RO7017773 —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
22/Protocol BP41316, Version 5 Sex 
10. Male and female participants with contraception requirements.  
The contraception and abstinence requirements are intended to prevent exposure of an embryo 
to the study treatment . The reliability of sexual abstinence for male and/or female enrollment 
eligibility needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or post -ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of 
preventing drug exposure.  
a) Female Participants  
A female participant is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant (see Appendix 5), not 
breastfeeding, and at least one of the following conditions applies:  
• Women of non- childbearing potential (WONCBP) as defined in Appendix 5 
• Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP), who:  
- Agree to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or us e contraceptive 
methods (hormonal or non -hormonal) that result in a failure rate of <1% per year during the 
treatment period and for at least [ADDRESS_1185313] dose of study drug. Examples of 
contraceptive methods with a failure rate of <1% per year include bilateral tubal ligation, 
male sterilization, established proper use of hormonal contraceptives that inhibit ovulation, hormone -releasing intrauterine devices, and copper intrauterine devices (see Appendix 5).  
Hormonal contraceptive methods must be supplemented by a barrier method (as defined in 
Appendix 5, preferably a condom with a spermicide) if participants are receiving any drug 
known to reduce the effect of hormonal contraception (including anti -epi[INVESTIGATOR_852399]). In such a situation, the risk assessment should be discussed with the 
Medical Monitor.  
Note: Females who reach menarche after enrollment in the study must agree from this time 
forward to regular blood or urine pregnancy testing as defined in the Schedule of Activities 
(SoA) and  must  agree to either remain completely sexually abstinent or comply with the same 
contraceptive requirements as outlined above for WOCBP from first menses until [ADDRESS_1185314] dose of study treatment (see Appendix 5).  
b) Male Pa rticipants  
Male contraception is not required in this study because of the minimal seminal dose transmitted 
through sexual intercourse (Banholzer et al 2016, Appendix 5).  
 
Additional Inclusion Criteria:  
11. Language, hearing, and vision compatible with the study measurements as judged by [CONTACT_3786].  Non-verbal individuals will be excluded from study participation.  
12. Allowed  existing treatment regimens should be stable for 8 weeks prior to screening except:  
• 6 weeks for non- pharmacological interventions  
• 12 weeks in the case of antipsychotic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]

NUMBER OF PARTICIPAN TS
  
Approximately 105 par ticipants with ASD randomized in a 1:1:[ADDRESS_1185319] be on a stable prescribed medication regimen for 8 weeks before screening, 
with the exception of antipsychotic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_852404]  (where participants 
need to be on a stable regimen for at least 12 weeks and 6 months  before sc reening , 
respectively ; see inclusion criterion 12). Any stable prescribed medication at screening should 
remain stable throughout the study. All changes in prescribed medication need to be discussed 
with the Sponsor (Medical Monitor or designee).  
Examples of  allowed medications:  
Use of the following therapi[INVESTIGATOR_144250], as specified below:  
• S
elective serotonin reuptake inhibitors/serotonin- norepi[INVESTIGATOR_5608] 
(SSRI/SNRI) antidepressants including fluoxetine (see also inclusion criteria)

• Occasional use of paracetamol/acetaminophen  
• Antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_7377] (carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_852405] e P450 [CYP] 3A4 induction) must be stable for 6 months  
• Benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_852406] a short t 1/2 (e.g., lorazepam, alprazolam, or oxazepam) are allowed if  
- taken only on an as needed (PRN) basis,  
- limited to 3 times per week ,  
- prescribed for short -term or intermittent medical conditions and,  
- not taken immediately before the assessments visits (i.e., not within 2 days or within 
5 times the elimination t1/2, whichever is longer before a scheduled visit).  
Note: for benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_852407] a long t 1/2 (except for benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_852408]/or withdrawal effects) see below (Prohibited Therapy).  
• Drugs known to prolong the QTc interval will be allowed if stable at screening provided the screening QTc does not meets exclusion QTc criterion (see list of drugs known to prolong 
QT in Appendix 8 of the protocol).  
• Any medication for medical illnesses other than ASD not listed under prohibited medications  
• Vaccines, including those against COVID -19 
 
Any other medications require the approval from the Investigator and the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor (or designee).  
Participants who use oral contraceptives, hormone -replacement therapy, or other maintenance 
therapy should continue their use.  
PROHIBITED THERAPY  
As a g eneral rule, no concomitant medication will be permitted, with the exception of 
medications to treat AEs, o ral contraceptives, hormone- replacement therapy, or other 
maintenance therapy listed above unless the rationale for exception is discussed and clearl y 
documented between the Investigator and the Sponsor.  
Use of the following therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (e.g., prescription drugs, over -the-counter (OTC) drugs, herbal 
remedies, nutritional supplements) is prohibited during the study and for at least 6 weeks prior 
to randomization (or within 5 times the elimination t
1/2, whichever is longer) to ensure washout of 
medication and until follow -up, unless otherwise specified below.  
Examples  of  prohibited medications:  
• S trong inhibitors of CYP3A4/5 (e.g., ketoconazole, clarithromycin, grapefruit juice)  
• Strong inducers of CYP3A4 (e.g., rifampi[INVESTIGATOR_2513], carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], phenytoin, phenobarbital, 
St. John’s Wort)  
• Under no circumstances should a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor be given in combination because 
of the potential increase in exposure. If the use of a strong inhibitor is indicated, the 
Investigator should contact [CONTACT_852464] (e.g., replacement of 
clarithromycin by [CONTACT_433592], which is not a CYP3A4 inhibitor). For certain cases, the Sponsor may advise pausing the treatment with RO7017773 and restarting when the 
CYP3A4 inhibitor has been discontinued and 5 times the elimination t
1/[ADDRESS_1185320] elapsed.   
• Chronic adrenocorticoid or glucocorticoid use (use of inhaled and topi[INVESTIGATOR_852409] e 
allowed)

11 Day 1 : 2 hours  (+/- 0.5 hours), 4 hours (+/ - 0.5 hours), and 6 hours (+0.5 hours) postdose, all on the same day; the last sample can be done on site or at 
home.  All Day 1 samples  are mandatory for adolesc ents until the 2nd Internal Monitoring Committee (IMC) + Scientific Oversight Committee (SOC) 
review . Day 1: only 2 hours (+/- 0.5 hours) postdose is mandatory for high- and low-functioning  adult  participant s.  
Day 14 : Predose and at 2 hours (+/ - 0.5 hours), 4 hours (end of visit but at least 4 hours postdose), and 6 hours (6- 8 hours) postdose; the last sample can be 
done on site or at home, either on the same day or at a later day within the same timeframe.  Day 14: 6 hours ( 6-8 hours ) postdose  sample  is optional for 
low-functioning adult  participant s. 
PK and safety samples will preferably be taken at the site; however , home nursing services will be available to allow for flexibility in the schedule of visits and 
to shorten site visits when the visit length depends on blood sampling.  
12 PD biomarker assessments at time of the day +/ - 1 hour of the t max (i.e., approximately 3 to 4 hours postdose [time window: 2.5 to 4.5 h ours postdose] ) at 
Pre-Baseline , Day 1, Week 2 and Week 12 visits  (for resting state qEEG) and at Pre -baseline, Day 1, and Week 2  visits for saccadic peak velocity [SPV], 
measured by [CONTACT_852465] [EOG] (SPV is not to be assessed at Week 12).  
At pre -baseline visit (no dosing), these assessment s should be conducted at about the same time of the day (+/ - 1 hour) corresponding to t max, (i.e., 
approximately 3 to 4 hours postdose at dosing days); The duration is approximately ~15 min assessment time + [ADDRESS_1185321] at the time of the day +/ -1h of the t max (i.e., approximately 3 to 4 hours postdose [time window: 2.5 to 4.5 h ours 
postdose] ) at Week 12. At pre-baseline visit (no dosing), these assessment s should be conducted at about the same time of the day (+/ - 1h) corresponding to 
tmax, (i.e., approximately 3 to 4 hours postdose at dosing days). The duration is appro ximately 50 min assessment time. The tasks will be performed 
immediately after the PD Biomarker assessments (see footnote 12) using the same equipment and therefore no extra EEG preparation time is needed.  
14 Additional pretreatment PD biomarker assessment on Day 1 (schedule as described in footnote 12). It is not necessary to remove the EEG electrodes after 
the pretreatment assessment and therefore the EEG preparation time for the 2nd assessment around t max, (i.e., approximately 3-4 hours postdose; see 
Footnote 12) will be considerably shorter.  
[ADDRESS_1185322] visit. Leftover from mandatory 
genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_852410].  
17 Leftover from mandatory PK plasma samples will be used for RBR if participant consents to RBR . 
19 Whole blood sample will be taken if participant consents to RBR  on Day  1 predose and at Week  12 or Early Termination visit . 
20 Telephone interview to assess for any clinically significant symptoms and/or new medication. 
21 The serum safety sample can be collected any time for specific assay (e.g., GLDH in case of Liver enzymes) if deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_852466].

36/Protocol BP41316, Version [ADDRESS_1185323] UDY RATIONALE  
The objectives of this Phase 2 proof- of-concept study (BP41316) are to investigate the 
efficacy, safety, and tolerability of RO7017773 in adolescents and adults (15 to 45 years 
of age) with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), with a target on the core symptoms of ASD 
of social communication deficits, and restricted and repetitive behaviors (RRBs) and interests. In addition, a set of biomarkers linked t o the mechanism of action of the study 
drug or to ASD -related alterations wi ll be investigated in a representative patient 
population to pi[INVESTIGATOR_852411] (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS] and 
Section [IP_ADDRESS]). To date, very few studies have investigated the effect of 
pharmacological treatments on the core symptoms of ASD and no pharmacological agents are a pproved. 
A key challenge in the development of new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_852412] ( Sarrett and Rommelfanger 2015) in both social deficits as well as in RRB. The 
presentation of RRB is known to be associated with age and level of intellectual  
functioning (Lam and Aman 2007, Esbensen et al 2009, Richler et al 2010, Kim and Lord 
2010). Thus, interventional treatment may have different effects, depending on age and intelligence quotient (IQ), in individuals with ASD. Hence, treatment effects in older adolescents and adults may not be extrapolated to effects in the pediatric population, given the potential difference in manifestations of both social skills and RRB with age. 
Adolescents and adults aged 15 to 45 years with ASD will be enrolled in this study to 
allow for the generation of data on the safety and tolerability and the potential efficacy in these age groups.  
The rationale for the study design is provided in Section 4.2. 
2.2 BACKGROUND  
2.2.1 B ackground on Disease  
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a group of heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) characterized by [CONTACT_737763]: impairments in social interaction and communication as well as presence of restrictive and repetitive behaviors, interests, 
or activities (American Psychiatric Association, 2013 ). Recently the prevalence of 
diagnosis of ASD in the U.S. has been reported to be 1.68% (1 in 59) in children of 8 
years of age ( Baio et al 2018) o r 2.79% in children from 3 to 7 years of age ( Xu et al 
2019 ). In Europe, the prevalence of ASD is within the same range with 1 in 100 people 
(Elsabbagh et al 2012). 
Core symptoms of ASD affecting domains of socialization, communication, and repetitive 
behavior are usually observed by [ADDRESS_1185324] themselves as

55/Protocol BP41316, Version 5 4.1.1 Length of the Study  
The total duration of the study for each participant will be up to 24 weeks (approximately 
5.6 months), divided as follows:  
• Screening period of at least 2 weeks and up to 4 weeks  
• Study pre-baseline and baseline period (2 weeks)  
• Study treatment period with fixed dose (12 weeks)  
• Safety and efficacy follow -up period (6 weeks). 
 
4.1.2 Individual Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_852414] a given individual participant if one 
of the following circumstances occurs, unless it is determined by [CONTACT_852470]: 
• QTc: A confirmed QTcF (average of triplicate values) above 480 ms or a change 
from baseline by [CONTACT_726] 60 ms (when confirmed in repeat measurement within 
30 minutes), will result in drug interruption. For the assessment of the QTcF stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_10035], c entral ECG readings should be used to determine whether the criteria have 
been met. An expedited review by [CONTACT_852471]. If the central readings are not available at the time of next dosing, 
this stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_852415].  Study drug may be resumed with the joint 
agreement of the Investigator and the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor when follow -up test 
results show that the participant no longer meets the dose interruption criteria.  
• Liver safety: Any participant with the occurrence of either of the following liver values will be discontinued: 
– ALT or AST >[ADDRESS_1185327] and bilirubin >[ADDRESS_1185328]  
– ALT or AST >[ADDRESS_1185329] associated with symptoms (new or worsening) believed 
to be related to liver injury or hypersensitivity  
• Other findings which, at the joint discretion of the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor, the 
Sponsor Safety Science Leader and the Investigator, indicate that dosing in this 
individual  should be stopped (e.g., severe sedation/somnolence, cognitive 
impairment) (see also Table 10).  
 
Ultimately and in case of disagreement, the Investigator remains responsible for the 
decision to stop dosing.  
4.1.3 Administrative Structure 
[IP_ADDRESS] I nternal Monitoring Committee (IMC) and Scientific Oversight 
Committee (SOC)  
An IMC consisting of a selected subset of [COMPANY_002] representative(s) as identified in the “IMC Agreement” will be responsible to perform interim analyses of accumulated safety, tolerability, PK, and efficacy (as required) data. The IMC members, the clinical 
 
RO7017773 —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
60/Protocol BP41316, Version [ADDRESS_1185330] completed the study if he/she has completed the last 
scheduled procedure shown in the SoA (Section 1.3). 
The end of the study will be considered to be the date of the last visit (including the last follow -up visit) of the last participant in the study (last participant last visit [LPLV]). 
5. STUDY POPULATION 
The study population rationale is provided in Section 4.2.1. 
Male and female participants aged 15 to 45 years with ASD according to DSM -5 who 
fulfill all the inclusion criteria listed in Section 5.1 and for whom none of the exclusion 
criteria listed in Section 5.2 apply will be included in the study.  
Prospective approval of protocol deviations, also known as protocol waivers or exemptions, is not permitted. 
The final decision on whether a participant will enter the randomized, double-blind 
treatment period will be made by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_852416]. An Eligibility Assessment Form (EAF, see Section 8.11.1) will be completed as 
part of the screening process and forwarded to an external vendor and Medical Monitor in order  to help ensure all relevant information has been taken into account. 
5.1 INCLUSION CRITERIA 
Participants are eligible to be included in the study only if all of the following criteria apply: 
Informed Consent 
1. Study participants or legal representatives should be able and willing to provide 
written informed consent or assent, as applicable and as per local requirements according to International Council for  Harmonisation (ICH) and local regulations. 
Alternatively, a legally authorized representative must be able to consent for the participant according to ICH and local regulations and assent must be given whenever possible. The ability to provide informed consent for each participant will 
be based on  the Principal investigator’s  clinical judgment. 
2. Availability of a parent or other reliable support person who is fluent in local language and has frequent and sufficient contact [CONTACT_6635]. The same person must 
agree to accompany the participant to all clinic visits and provide information about the participant’s behavior and symptoms and must agree to oversee the participant’s adherence with protocol -specified procedures and study medication dosing. 
 
RO7017773 —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
61/Protocol BP41316, Version 5 • For support persons of high -functioning adult participants, no on- site visits 
are necessary after the screening visit if all eCOA assessments, interview, 
and forms are performed remotely (see  Section  4.1 and  Appendix  1 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
Age 
3. Age 15 to 45 years, at the time of signing the informed consent or assent form. 
Type of Participants and Disease Characteristics 
4. Males and female participants with Autism Spectrum Disorder according to 
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM -5). 
• For transgender participants , the Investigator should consult with the Medical 
Monitor or delegate to assess potential safety concerns or interference with safety and efficacy testing. Transgender participants will be enrolled by [CONTACT_852472].  
Note: It is important that a high-confidence autism diagnosis has been established 
by [CONTACT_852473]. 
5. Social Responsiveness Scale, Second Edition (SRS -2) (T -score)
 ≥ 66. 
6. Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI-II)  or equivalent assessment  ≥ [ADDRESS_1185331] 12 months prior to screening (for adults within the 
last 5 years prior to screening if the assessment was done at age 18 or older) . The 
proportion of low -functioning partici pants (IQ  ≥  50 to 69) will be limited to 25% 
overall . 
• If a previous  assessment is used, the Investigator should assess whether it has 
been performed by [CONTACT_852462]. 
7. ASD or Autism diagnosis confirmed by [CONTACT_713961] 
(ADOS-2), done by a certified rater at screening, or within the last [ADDRESS_1185332] moderate to severe repetitive behaviors as per Children’s Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale modified for ASD (CY -BOCS -ASD) t otal 
score of at least 8  at screening.

RO7017773 —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
62/Protocol BP41316, Version 5 Sex 
10. Male and female participants with contraception requirements.  
The contraception and abstinence requirements are intended to prevent exposure of an 
embryo to the study treatment. The reliability of sexual abstinence for male and/or female enrollment eligibility needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of preventing drug exposure. 
a) Female Participants  
A female participant is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant (see Appendix  5), not 
breastfeeding, and at least one of the following conditions applies:  
• Women of non-childbearing potential (WONCBP), as defined in Appendix  5. 
• Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP), who: 
– Agree to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use 
contraceptive methods (hormonal or non-hormonal) that result in a failure rate of 
<1% per year during the treatment period and for at least [ADDRESS_1185333] dose of study drug. Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of 
<1% per year include bilateral tubal ligation, male sterilization, established 
proper use of hormonal contraceptives that inhibit ovulation, hormone-releasing 
intrauterine devices, and copper  intrauterine devices (see Appendix 5 ). 
Hormonal contraceptive methods must  be s
 upplemented by a barrier method ( as 
defined in Appendix  5 ; preferably condom with a spermicide) i f participants are 
receiving any drug known to reduce the effect of hormonal contraception (including 
anti-epi[INVESTIGATOR_852417]). In such a situation, the risk 
assessment should be discussed with the Medical Monitor. 
Note: Females who reach menarche after enrollment in the study must agree from 
this time forward to regul ar blood or urine pregnancy testing as defined in the SoA 
and must  agree to either remain completely sexually abstinent or comply with the 
same contraceptive requirements as outlined above for WOCBP from first menses until [ADDRESS_1185334] dose of study treatment (see Appendix  5). 
b) Male Participants  
Male contraception is not required in this study because of the minimal seminal dose transmitted through sexual intercourse ( Banholzer et al 2016, Appendix  5). 
 
 
RO7017773 —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
63/Protocol BP41316, Version 5 Additional Inclusion Criteria:

68/Protocol BP41316, Version 5 The packaging and labeling of the study medication will be in accordance with the 
Sponsor’s standard and local regulations. 
The study site should follow all instructions included with each shipment of IMP. The 
investigational site will acknowledge receipt of IMPs and confirm the shipment condition and content. Any damaged shipments will be replaced. The investigator or designee must confirm that appropriate temperature conditions have been maintained during transit for all IMPs received and that any discrepancies have been reported and resolved before use of the IMPs. All IMPs must be stored in a secure, environmentally controlled, and monitored (manual or automated) area in accordance with the labeled storage conditions, with access limited to the investigator and authorized staff.  
Only participants enrolled in the study may receive IMPs, and only authorized staff may supply or administer IMPs. 
The study site (i.e., Investigator or other authorized personnel [e.g., pharmacist or 
nurse]) is responsible for maintaining records of IMP delivery to the site, IMP inventory at the site, IMP use by [CONTACT_20908], and disposition or return of unused IMP, thus 
enabling reconciliation of all IMP received, and for ensuring that participants are provided with doses specified by [CONTACT_760].  
Upon arrival of the IMPs at the site, site personnel will complete the following: 
• Check the IMPs for damage.  
• Verify proper identity, quantity, integrity of seals and temperature conditions. 
• Report any deviations or product complaints to the Study Monitor upon discovery. 
 
The qualified individual responsible for dispensing the study treatment will  dispense the 
pack(s) according to the numbers issued by [CONTACT_852474] (voice/web) response system 
(IxRS).  
The Investigator or delegate must confirm appropriate temperature conditions have been 
maintained during transit for all study treatment received and any discrepancies are reported and resolved before use of the study treatment. 
Only participants enrolled in the study may receive study treatment and only authorized 
site staff may supply or administer study treatment. All study treatments must be stored in a secure, environmentally controlled, and monitored (manual or automated) area in accordance with the labeled storage conditions with access limited to the Investigator and authorized site staff.  
The Investigator is responsible for study treatment accountability, reconciliation, and record maintenance (i.e., receipt, reconciliation, and final disposition records).

available only to those individuals responsible for PK sample bioanalysis and to statisticians or programmers at the Sponsor directly involved in the production of outputs to support IMC and SOC meetings. The data will be analyzed in a secure area which is not accessible to any blinded personnel.  
6.3.2 Blinding  
The IxRS  w ill be programmed with blind-breaking instructions. The blind may be broken 
if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], it is in the participant’s best interest to know the study treatment assignment. The Sponsor must be notified before the blind is broken unless identification of the study treatment is required for a medical emergency in which 
the knowledge of the specific blinded study treatment will affect the immediate management of the participant’s condition (e.g., antidote available). In this case, the  
Sponsor must be notified within [ADDRESS_1185339] be recorded in the source documentation and Clinical Study Report (CSR), as applicable.  
Unblinding should not result in the withdrawal of the participants from the study. Every 
effort should be made to retain unblinded participants.  
If unblinding is necessary for participant management (in the case of an SAE), the Investigator will be able to break the treatment code by [CONTACT_123517]. Treatment 
codes should not be broken except in emergency situations. If the Investigator wishes to know the identity of the study treatment for any other reason, he/she should contact [CONTACT_66324]. The Investigator should document and provide an explanation for any premature unblinding (e.g., accidental unblinding, unblinding due to an SAE). 
As per Health Authority reporting requirements, the Sponsor will break the treatment 
code for all unexpected SAEs (see Section 8.3.4) that are considered by [CONTACT_77403]. 
Whenever disclosure of the identity of the test medication is necessary, adequate 
procedures will be in place to ensure integrity of the data.

73/Protocol BP41316, Version 5 Use of the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_187607] (e.g., prescription drugs, OTC drugs, herbal remedies, 
nutritional supplements) is prohibited during the study and for at least 6 weeks prior to randomization (or within 5 times the elimination t
1/2, whichever is longer) to ensure 
washout of medication and until follow -up, unless otherwise specified below.  
Examples of prohibited medications (see also Appendix  6): 
• Strong inhibitors of CYP3A4/5 (e.g., ketoconazole, clarithromycin, grapefruit juice)  
• Strong inducers of CYP3A4 (e.g., rifampi[INVESTIGATOR_2513], carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], phenytoin, 
phenobarbital, St. John’s Wort)  
• Under no circumstances should a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor be given in combination 
because of the potential increase in exposure. If the use of a strong inhibitor is 
indicated, the Investigator should contact [CONTACT_852464] (e.g., replacement of clarithromycin by [CONTACT_433592], which is not a CYP3A4 
inhibitor). For certain cases, the Sponsor may advise pausing the treatment with 
RO7017773 and restarting when the CYP3A4 inhibitor has been discontinued and 5 
times the elimination t
1/[ADDRESS_1185344] elapsed.  
• Chronic adrenocorticoid or glucocorticoid use (use of inhaled and topi[INVESTIGATOR_852422])  
• Regarding the use of anxiolytics, sedatives , and hypnotics : benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_852406] a 
long t 1/2 or benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050]-like drugs pharmacologically similar to benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050] 
(e.g., zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_6730], zopi[INVESTIGATOR_11123], eszopi[INVESTIGATOR_11123], and zaleplon) will not be allowed during 
screening and treatment periods (for benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_852406] a short t 1/2 that are 
allowed see Section 6.5.1.

protocol.  
Details on study and site closures are provided in Appendix  1 Study Governance 
Consider
ations Study. 
7.1 DISCONTINUATION OF STUDY TREATMENT  
For data to be collected at the time of treatment discontinuation and follow -up and for 
any further evaluations that need to be completed, see the SoA (Section 1.3). 
Reasons for discontinuation of study treatment (or withdrawal from the study) may 
include but are not limited to the following: 
• Participant unable to continue to comply with the study treatment and study 
requirements  
• Any medical condition that the Investigator or Sponsor determines may jeopardize the participant’s safety if he or she continues in the study  
• Investigator or Sponsor determination that treatment discontinuation is in the best interest of the participant  
• Pregnancy  
• Any event that meets the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_103034] 4.1.2 
• Specific adverse events if discontinuation of treatment is required to manage the 
event 
 
Every effort should be made to obtain information on participants who withdraw from the 
study treatment but have not withdrawn consent. Participants who discontinue study treatment prematurely will be asked to return to the clinic for a study completion/early 
termination visit and may undergo fol low‑up assessments (see Section 8.11.3), unless 
the participant withdrew consent. The primary reason for premature study treatment 
discontinuation should be documented on the appropriate eCRF. Participants who 
discontinue study treatment prematurely will not be replaced.  
7.1.1 Temporary Interruption 
If study treatment administration is delayed by [CONTACT_726] 3 days relative to the scheduled admi nistration date, this will be considered a treatment interruption. Administration may 
resume at the next planned dosing date. A missed dose of study treatment will not be made up. 
Before permanently discontinuing study treatment (regardless of whether initiated by [CONTACT_2416], the Investigator or Sponsor), an interruption should be considered.  
Temporary study drug interruption is an acceptable method to manage AEs related to any 
of the study treatments. Participants who have temporarily interrupted study treatment 
 
RO7017773 —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
76/Protocol BP41316, Version 5 should be considered for restarting as soon as medically justified in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_684]. 
7.2 PARTICIPANT DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL FROM THE 
STUDY  
Participants have the right to voluntarily withdraw from the study at any time for any 
reason.  
In addition, the Investigator has the right to withdraw a participant from the study for medical conditions that the Investigator or Sponsor determines may jeopardize the participant’s safety if he/she continues in the study.  
If possible, information on reason for withdrawal from the study should be obtained. The primary reason for withdrawal from the study should be documented on the appropriate eCRF. Participants will not be followed for any reason after consent has been withdrawn. 
When a participant voluntarily withdraws from the study, or is withdrawn by [CONTACT_3786], samples collected until the date of withdrawal will be analyzed, unless the participant specifically requests for these to be discarded or local laws require their immediate destruction. However, if samples have been tested prior to withdrawal, results from those tests will be used as part of the overall research data. A participant's withdrawal from this study does not, by [CONTACT_5071], constitute withdrawal of samples donated to the Research Biosample Repository (RBR).  
Participants who withdraw from the study will not be replaced.  
For data to be collected at the time of study discontinuation and at safety and follow-up 
visits and for any further evaluations that need to be completed, see SoA (Section 1.3). 
7.[ADDRESS_1185345] be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a 
required study visit: 
• The site must attempt to contact [CONTACT_14315], counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascertain whether or not the participant wishes to and/or

8. STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES  
Study procedures and their timepoints  are summarized in the SoA (Section 1.3). 
Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed.  
Urgent safety concerns should be discussed with the Sponsor immediately upon 
occurrence or awareness to determine whether the participant should continue or discontinue study treatment. 
Procedures conducted as part of the participant’s routine clinical management 
(e.g., blood count)  and obtained before signing of the ICF may be utilized for screening 
or baseline purposes provided the procedure met the protocol -specified criteria and was 
performed within the time-frame defined in the SoA. 
8.1 EFFICACY ASSESSM ENTS

RO7017773 —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
81/Protocol BP41316, Version 5 An external company(ies) and external consultants will provide training to all raters on 
the various scales and will provide all sites with the relevant record forms, instruction manuals, and kits as appropriate. Training and requirements on rater qualifications are described separately in the external company(ies)’ documentation.  
For some electronic  clinical outcome assessments  (eCOAs) audio recordings may be 
captured. These audio recordings will be reviewed by [CONTACT_852478]. If necessary, raters will be contact[CONTACT_852479].  
Remote centralized ratings for the Vineland -3 scale (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ) and the 
CY-BOCS -ASD (se e Section [IP_ADDRESS] ) will be carried out via live secure videoconference. 
The interview for the Vineland-[ADDRESS_1185346] any information about the participant and support person from 
these video or audio recordings.  
8.1.1 Requirements for Support Persons  
Each participant will need a reliable caregiver, parent, or support person (moving forward they will be deemed the “support person”). The same support person will provide feedback on all informant- based assessments throughout the study and the same 
person must attend all on-site visits. If a support person visit cannot be completed as arranged (e.g., the support person is delayed in transit) visits should be rescheduled as 
soon as possible after the original appointment within the specified time window , or 
incomplete or missing eCOA assessment may be completed remotely (see Appendix  1, 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). For support persons of high -functioning a
 dult participants, no on -site 
visits are necessary after the screening visit if all eCOA assessments, interview, and 
forms are performed remotely (see  Appendix 1 , Se
ction [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
In the Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], the support person should be deemed appropriate to participate in the study and able of following the applicable study procedures, including participation in video calls  with the central rater for the Vineland-[ADDRESS_1185347] with the participant (see below) and is willing and able to attend the on-site visits when required. The support person must oversee the participant’s 
 
RO7017773 —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
82/Protocol BP41316, Version 5 adherence with protocol -specified procedures, and report on the participant’s status via 
completion of study assessments.  
If the support person does not live with the participant, the Investigator has to be 
satisfied that the participant can contact [CONTACT_852480]. If in doubt about whether a participant’s care arrangements are suitable for inclusion, the Investigator should discuss this with Sponsor (Medical Monitor or designee). A non-cohabitating support person must spend sufficient time with the participant so that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], the support person can reliably assess the participant’s mental status, activities and behavior, and report on the participant’s adherence and health. This would normall y be possible when the support person spends a few hours with the participant 
every day.  
The support person arrangements for participants living in a residential home need to be assessed carefully on a case by [CONTACT_413]:  
• A staff member of the residential  home can be the support person if this person 
spends sufficient time with the participant. In the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], the 
support person must be able to reliably assess the participant’s mental status, activities, and behavior, and report on the participant’s adherence and health. This 
would normally be possible when the support person spends a few hours with the participant every day.  
• A family member living at the participant’s home can be the support person if the 
participant returns home every night. When the participant only returns home over the weekend, a family member can be the support person only if they have intensive 
interaction with the participant during the week e.g., via phone calls, calls via Skype, 
SMS messages, etc. The quality of these interactions between support person and 
participant needs to be assessed for each participant to determine whether the level 
of interaction is sufficient. 
• A family member cannot be the support person when the participant lives full time in 
the residential home, unless the family member spends a few hours in the residential home with the participant every day. 
 
If in doubt about whether a participant’s care arrangements are suitable for inclusion, the 
Investigator should discuss this with the Sponsor (Medical Monitor or designee). 
8.1.2 Instructions for Support Person 
Because of the important role of the support persons as the respondents in several key assessments,  they will be provided with instructions on their role in the study  as well as 
background information on ASD symptoms and behaviors  at screening (see SoA in 
Section 1.3) by [CONTACT_737]. This aims  to help them report accurately on the 
 
RO7017773 —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
83/Protocol BP41316, Version 5 participant’s health and behaviors and mitigate the risk of overt placebo response. 
Instructions will also be provided at the baseline and Week [ADDRESS_1185348] reading deficits the following procedure for the mandatory participant-reported scales should be used:  
• The scale administrator will read out the questions and answers and show the 
answers on the Rater station.  
• The participant will choose one of the possible answers on the Rater station. 
 
If the participant is still unable to complete the scale even with the described assistance, 
the scale will be skipped.  
8.1.4 Screening Assessments 
The following assessments will be performed at screening to check the participant’s eligibility for this study.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence, Second Edition 
(WASI -II) 
The WASI-II is a tool used to evaluate an individual’s cognitive functioning and generate 
IQ scores ( Wechsler 1999, Wechsler 2011) and will be administered by a qualified rater 
at screening. If the WASI-II or an equivalent assessment (e.g., the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale [WAIS]) has been performed by [CONTACT_852481] 12 months of the screening visit (within 5 years prior to screening 
for adults if the assessment was done at the age of 18 years  or older) , there will be no 
requirement to repeat it.  
The assessment will take approximately 30 minutes to complete. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, Second Edition 
(ADOS- 2) 
The ADOS -2 is a diagnostic tool used to document the presence of ASD ( Gotham et al 
[ADDRESS_1185349] et al 2000). During a semi -structured evaluation, the individual is observed in 
a naturalistic social situation and assessed across areas of social communication, 
imagination, and restricted and/or repetitive behaviors. Only qualified ADOS -2 raters are 
allowed to perform the ADOS-2 to confirm eligibility of participants.  
 
RO7017773 —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
84/Protocol BP41316, Version 5 The ADOS -2 includes four modules for use with different age groups and language 
levels; modules 2, 3, and 4 will be used in this study. The appropriate module of the 
ADOS -2 will be administered by a certified rater at screening. 
The assessment will take approximately 35 to 40 minutes to complete. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Social Responsiveness Scale, Second Edition (SRS -2) 
The SRS -2 is a 65-item informant-based rating scale designed specifically for use in 
ASD to quantitatively measure an individual’s ability to engage in emotionally appropriate reciprocal  social behavior in a naturalistic social setting ( Constantino 2005). 
Each item on the scale enquires about an observed aspect of reciprocal social behavior that is rated on a scale from 1 (not true) to 4 (almost always true). Social skill levels are assessed over five domains: Social Awareness, Social Cognition, Social 
Communication, Social Motivation, and Autistic Mannerisms. The total score generated serves as an index of severity of social deficits in the autism spectrum. The SRS-2 total score is expressed in raw and T-scores. Raw scores are converted to T-scores for gender and respondent. T-scores of 66 through 75 are interpreted as indicating moderate deficiencies in reciprocal social behavior that are clinically significant and lead to substantial interference in everyday social interactions. A total T-score of 76 or higher is considered to indicate severe deficiencies and strongly associated with clinical diagnosis of autistic disorder ( Wilkinson 2017).  
The support person will complete the rating scale at screening. A clinician will be 
available to assist the support person during completion of the questionnaire. 
This assessment will take approximately 15 to 20 minutes to complete. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Children’s Yale- Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale Modified 
for ASD (CY- BOCS- ASD)   
The CY -BOCS -ASD is a modified version of the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive 
Scale (Y-BOCS), for children and adolescents with ASD. The interviewer asks the 
support person about past and present repetitive behaviors, guided by [CONTACT_852482] ( Scahill 2014). It contains a list of 25 behaviors, classified 
into the following categories: hoarding/ritualistic behavior, sensory -motor and arranging, 
insistence on routines, self-injurious behaviors, stereotypy, and restricted interests. This checklist was expanded from the original version to include repetitive behaviors commonly seen in children with ASD. A target symptom list comprising the four most 
troublesome behaviors is established by [CONTACT_20679]. The severity (0 to 4) of each target behavior is rated for the following five items: time spent, interference, distress, resistance, and degree of control to generate a total score (0 -20). Two additional items 
 
RO7017773 —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
85/Protocol BP41316, Version 5 (repetitive behavior -free interval and peculiarity) are also rated but are not included in 
the total score. 
The ratings evaluate the symptom severity over the past week and are based on the 
information collected from the participant and support person during the interview. The final rating is based on the clinical judgment of the central rater. 
The interview should take approximately [ADDRESS_1185350] at the timepoints specified in the SoA in Section 1.3. 
Support persons, clinicians and participants will use an electronic device to capture 
clinical outcome assessments (COAs) specified in the sections below (see also Appendix  1, Section [IP_ADDRESS]). The specific sequence of assessments will be predefined 
on the electronic device f 
or each participant and should be followed throughout the 
study.  
Any entries on COA sho
uld be reviewed for completeness by [CONTACT_852483]. If 
a scale cannot be completed during the visit or for a scale, the total score (e.g., the composite scores for Vineland -3) cannot be calculated with the available data, it 
should be attempted to repeat the scale during an unscheduled visit as soon as possible (within the next 7 days).  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale, Third Edition (VinelandTM-3) 
The Vineland is an instrument that measures communication, daily living skills, 
socialization, motor skills (only used in children up to 9 years of age) and maladaptive 
(not assessed in this study) behaviors of individuals with developmental disabilities (Sparrow et al 2005). The Comprehensive Interview will be administered to a participant’s support person in this study, during which the rater or clinician will ask to the support person open -ended questions relating to the participant’s activities and 
behavior. Domain scores will be obtained for the individual domains of Socializ ation, 
Communication, and Daily Living Skills and used to calculate the Vineland
 Adaptive 
Behavior Composite score. Standardized scores on the Adaptive Behavior Composite score range from 20 to 160, with higher scores indicating better adaptive functioning.  
Vineland
TM-3 will be administered at different visits (see SoA in Section  1.3) by [CONTACT_852484], secure telemedicine pl atform . For any individual participant, the same 
rater should administer the VinelandTM.  
 
RO7017773 —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
86/Protocol BP41316, Version 5 This interview will take approximately 45 to 60 minutes. The rater will interview the 
support person to complete the VinelandTM. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Repetitive Behavior Scale- Revised (RBS- R) 
The RBS -R is a 43-item informant-based questionnaire, assessing the variety of 
restricted and repetitive behaviors observed in individuals with ASD ( Bodfish et al 2000). 
The scale is grouped into six subscales: Stereotyped, Self-Injurious, Compulsive, 
Ritualistic, Sameness, and Restricted Behaviors. Each item utilizes a 4-point response 
scale assessing the presence and severity of a restricted or repetitive behavior. Response options range from "Behavior does not occur" (0) to "Behavior occurs and is a severe problem" (3). On the last question, participants are asked to “lump together” all of 
the behaviors described in the questionnaire and provide a rating for how much of a problem these repetitive behaviors are overall, on a scale from 1 to 100: where “ 1” 
represents “not a problem at all” and “100” represents “as bad as you can imagine”. 
A total score is generated for each subscale and an overall total score encompasses all 
the subscales. The overall total score ranges from 0 to 129; higher scores are indicative of more severe RRBs.  
It will take the support person approximately 15 minutes to complete the RBS -R. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Caregiver -Reported Routines Inventory (CRRI)  
The CRRI is a caregiver -reported RRB scale for older adolescents and adults based on 
the Children Routine Inventory -Revised  (Evans et al 2017). It has been developed by [CONTACT_852485]-Revised  in collaboration with the Sponsor in 
order to extend the age -range for caregiver -reported Routine Inventory scales to older 
adults and adolescents. The CRRI  questionnaire captures a wide range of RRBs, 
including stereotypi[INVESTIGATOR_014], tics, compulsions, habits, sensory sensitivities, and focused 
interests, in the context of typi[INVESTIGATOR_852423] 
(Evans et al 2017). All items will be answered on a five-point Likert scale from “not at 
all/never ,” “a little/rarely ,” “somewhat/sometimes ,” “quite a lot/often, ” and “very much 
/always .” Forms with appropriate recall periods will be used at the timepoints indicated in 
the SoA ( Section 1.3).  
The CRRI  scale includes 62 items. It will take the support person approximately 
17 minutes  to complete the CRRI . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Global Impression- Severity (CGI- S) and Improvement 
(CGI- I) Scales 
The CGI rating scales are tools used to evaluate both the severity of illness and change from Baseline (Guy et al 1976 ). The CGI-S reflects the rater’s impression of the 
participant’s current autism severity on a 7-point scale ranging from no symptoms (1) to 
 
RO7017773 —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
88/Protocol BP41316, Version 5 Seeking”, “Sensory Sensitivity”, and “Sensation Avoiding”. The adolescent/adult form is 
a unique sensory measure in that it is a self-reported questionnaire.  
The questionnaire takes 10 to 15 minutes for the participant to complete. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Short Sensory Profile 2 (SSP-2 ) 
The Short Sensory Profile Version 2 (SSP -2; Dunn 2014) is a 34-item parent or support 
person-reported questionnaire that probes for the effect of sensory processi ng 
anomalies on a person’s ability to function in daily life. Item responses occur on a five-point Likert-rating scale from 1 (almost never) to 5 (almost always). The SSP -2 was 
based on the Sensory Processing Framework ( Dunn 1999) and provides scores in four 
quadrants based on the child’s neurological threshold to sensory input and their method of self-regulation. The four quadrants are Seeking (“the degree to which a child obtains 
sensory input”), Avoiding (“the degree to which a child is bothered by [CONTACT_852486]”), Sensitivity (“the degree to which a child detects sensory input.”), and Registration (“the degree to which a child misses sensory input.”). 
The SSP -2 will be performed by [CONTACT_852487] -functioning 
adults. It will take the support person approximately 7 minutes to complete the SSP -2. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory  (PedsQL ) Version 4.0 
Generic Core Scale and Cognitive Functioning Scale 
The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory  (PedsQL™) Version 4.0 Generic Core Scale 
assessment consists of a 23-item questionnaire encompassing four core scale domains: 
Physical Functioning (8 items), Emotional Functioning (5 items), Social Functioning (5 items) and School Functioning (5 items). In addition to the four scale scores a 
Psychosocial Health Summary score, a Physical Health Summary score, and a total score can also be computed by [CONTACT_852488]. 
The PedsQL  Cognitive Functioning Scale, which contains six items, will also be 
completed. Each item in the PedsQL  Generic Core and Cognitive Functioning scales 
utilizes a 5- point response scale ranging from "never (a problem)" (0) to "almost always 
(a problem)" (4). Items are then reverse-scored and linearly transformed to a 0- to 100-
point scale (0 = 100, 1 = 75, 2 = 50, 3 = 25, and 4 = 0), i.e., higher scores indicate better 
quality of life or cognitive function.  
The following standard forms with a recall period of one month will be employed in this 
study ( Varni et al 2004): adult self-report (ages 18+, high-functioning), pediatric self-
report (adolescents aged 15 to -17 years, high-functioning). In addition, support 
person-reported forms will be used for  all low -functioning participants.  
 
RO7017773 —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
89/Protocol BP41316, Version 5 It will take approximately 10 minutes to complete the PedsQL  Generic Core and 
Cognitive Functioning scales. 
The cognitive tests will be applied as part of the safety assessments (see Section 8.2.7). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Neurocognitive Battery  
The cognitive tests will be applied as part of the safety assessments (see Section 8.2.7). 
The total battery takes approximately 45 minutes to perform, the selection of attention 
tasks (detection, identification, and one back tests) takes approximately 10 minutes to perform.  
For low -functioning participants, the selection of attention tasks (detection, 
identification, and one back tests) should be prioritized and performed first. All effort 
should be made to also collect the remainder of the tasks if the study participant is able 
to comply.  If not all tasks can be completed, an explanation should be recorded on the 
“Additional Observations” eCRF.  
Two test sessions of shorter duration will be carried out at the pre-baseline visit for 
habituation to the test environment.  
Detection Test (Psychomotor Function) 
The Detection Test (DET) is a measure of psychomotor function and uses a well -
validated simple reaction time paradigm with playing card stimuli. In this test, the playing 
cards all  depi[INVESTIGATOR_852424]. The participant is asked to press the “Yes” key as soon 
as the card in the center of the screen turns face up. The software measures the speed and accuracy of each response.  
This assessment takes approximately [ADDRESS_1185351] (Attention) 
The Identification Test (IDN) is a measure of visual attention and uses a well -validated 
choice reaction time paradigm with playing card stimuli. In this test, the playing cards are 
all either red or black jokers. The participant is asked whether the card displayed in the center of the screen is red. The participant responds by [CONTACT_117775] “Yes” key when the joker card is red and No when it is black. The software measures the speed and 
accuracy of each response. 
This assessment takes approximately 3 minutes to perform. 
 
RO7017773 —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
90/Protocol BP41316, Version [ADDRESS_1185352] (Visual Learning)  
The One Card Learning Test (OCL) is a measure of visual learning and uses a well -
validated pattern separation paradigm with playing card stimuli. In this test, the playing 
cards are identical to those found in a standard deck of 52 playing cards (without the joker cards). The participant is asked whether the card displayed in the center of the screen was seen previously in this test. The participant responds by [CONTACT_117775] “Yes” or “No” key. The software measures the speed and accuracy of each response.  
This assessment takes approximately [ADDRESS_1185353] (Working M emory)  
The One Back Test (ONB) is a measure of working memory and uses a well -validated n-
back paradigm with playing card stimuli. In this test, the playing cards are identical to 
those found in a standard deck of 52 playing cards (without the joker cards). The participant is asked whether the card displayed in the center of the screen is the same as the card presented immediately previously. The participant responds by [CONTACT_117775] “Yes” or “No” key. Because no card has been presented yet on the first trial, a correct first response is always “No”. The software measures the speed and accuracy of each response.  
This assessment takes approximately [ADDRESS_1185354] (Working Memory)  
The Two Back Test (TWOB) is a measure of working memory and uses a well -validated 
n-back paradigm with playing card stimuli. In this test, the playing cards are identical to 
those found in a standard deck of 52 playing cards (without the joker cards). The participant is asked whether the card displayed in the center of the screen is the same as the one presented two cards previously. The participant responds by [CONTACT_117775] “Yes” or “No” key. Because no card has been presented two-back on the first and second trials, a correct response on these trials is always “No”. The software measures the speed and accuracy of each response.  
This assessment takes approximately [ADDRESS_1185355] (Verbal Learning) 
The International Shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_190458] (ISL) is a measure of verbal learning and uses a well -

frequencies, high imagery, concrete nouns (items from a shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_321579]) are read to the 
 
RO7017773 —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
91/Protocol BP41316, Version [ADDRESS_1185356] been read, the participant is asked to recall as many of the words as 
he/she can as quickly as possible. The test supervisor uses a mouse or stylus to mark 
the words recalled by [CONTACT_852489]. When the subject can recall no more words, the same list is read a second time. The test supervisor records the words recalled by [CONTACT_852490]. This is then repeated a third tim e. 
30 minutes later: without having the list read again, the participant is asked to recall the 
words from the list (delayed recall condition). The recall test is followed by a recognition condition test where the test supervisor reads a shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_852425] (if the item was on the original list) or negatively (if it was not). The recall and recognition test is repeated the next day about [ADDRESS_1185357] learning. If the clinic visit is split into two days (which is possible for Week 6, Week 12, and 6 -week follow-up visits, see 
SoA in Section 1.3) the repeats are performed at the clinic. If the participant returned 
home after the first day the repeats are performed over the phone as close in time to the 24h timepoint as possible. In addition, questions about the sleep quantity and quality will 
be asked. The software registers the number of correct responses as recorded by [CONTACT_852491]. 
This assessment takes approximately 15 minutes to perform (5 minutes for each of the 
three parts).  
Continuous Paired Associate Learning T est (Paired Associate Learning) 
The Continuous Paired Associate Learning Test (CPAL) is a measure of visual associate 
memory and uses a well -validated paired associate learning paradigm in which the 
subject must learn the locations of a number of amoeba-like shapes on the computer screen. This test consists of a single amoeboid shape displayed in the center of the screen surrounded by a number of blue- filled circles. Beneath all but two of the blue 
spheres are amoeboid shapes, one of which matches the central display; the two remaining circles are distractors. In the exposure phase of the test all of the to-be-remembered pattern-location associations are presented on the computer screen simultaneously. After a five second delay, a pattern is shown in the central location and this signals that the subject should touch the location in the periphery that contains the same pattern. This process continues until the participant has acknowledged all of the pattern-location associations. The learning phase begins with the same test display presented during the exposure phase except that now all of the peripheral locations are shown as blue spheres. One of the patterns presented in the exposure phase is presented in the center location. With the presentation of this pattern, the participant is required to select the peripheral location where an identical pattern is hidden beneath the blue sphere. This process continues until the correct location of each pattern is

There are six learning trials (a single trial delayed recall condition will be done after a 30-
minute delay). The software records each move as an error or as a correct move.  
This assessment takes approximately [ADDRESS_1185359] (Executive Function)

The Karolinska Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_7110] (KSS; Akersted and Gillberg 1990, Baulk et al 2001) 
will be completed as part of the safety assessments (see Section 8.2.7). The KSS 
measures the subjective level of sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_127164] a particular time during the day. On this scale, participants (or support persons for adolescents aged 15 to 17 years and for low -
functioning participants) indicate which level best reflects the psycho-physical state experienced in the last 5 minutes. The KSS is a 9-point scale (1 = extremely alert, 9 = very sleepy, great effort to keep awake, fighting sleep).  
This assessment takes approximately 5 minutes to perform.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Epworth Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_7110] (ESS)  
The Epworth Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_7110] (ESS; Johns 1991, Johns 1992) will be completed as 
part of the safety assessments (see Section 8.2.7). The ESS is a brief, self-administered 
eight-item questionnaire that measures daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_852426]. Participant will be asked to rate on a scale of 0-3 the chances that, “over the past month” and “since last visit”, he/she would have dozed in eight specific situations that are commonly met in 
daily life (0 = would never doze; 3 = high chance of dozing). Thus, the participant is asked to characterize, retrospectively, part of his usual behavior in a variety of situations that are more or less soporific. The ESS score is the sum of eight item -scores and can 
range from 0 to 24.

The Epworth Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_269985] (ESS -CHAD; Johns 2015) 
will be completed as part of the safety assessments (see Section 8.2.7). The ESS-CHAD 
is a brief, support perso n-administered eight-item questionnaire that measures daytime 
sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_852427]. Support persons of adolescents and participants 
with an IQ score <70 will be asked to rate on a scale of 0-3 the chances that, "Over the past month," and “since last visit”, “your child” would have dozed in eight specific situations that are commonly met in daily life (0 = would never doze; 3 = high chance of dozing). Thus, the support person is asked to characterize, retrospectively, part of his usual behavior in a variety of situations that are more or less soporific. The ESS score is the sum of eight item -scores and can range from 0 to 24.  
This assessment takes approximately 5 minutes to perform.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Sudden Onset of Sleep Questionnaire  
The Sudden Onset of Sleep Questionnaire has been developed by [CONTACT_852492] (see Section 8.2.7). Each 
participant (or support person for adolescents aged 15 to 17 years and for low-functioning participants) will be asked to answer a series of up to 8 questions to 
assess the occurrence of daytime somnolence, its suddenness (level of awareness ), 
frequency and circumstances in which the epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865](s) took place, impact on work/daily activities/ social life, if worried by [CONTACT_14198][INVESTIGATOR_852428] (see Appendix  2 for 
reporting of AEs). This questionnaire will be administered as an interview. 
This assessment takes approximately 5 minutes to perform. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Patient -Reported Outcomes Measurements Information System 
(PROMIS) Sleep Disturbance Questionnaire Short Form  
The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurements Information System ( PROMIS) Sleep 
Disturbance Short Form ( Yu Lan et al 2011, Buysse et al 2010) assesses self-reported 
perceptions of sleep quality, sleep depth, and restoration associated with sleep. This includes perceived difficulties and concerns with getting to sleep or staying asleep, as well as perceptions of the adequacy of and satisfaction with sleep. This questionnaire assesses sleep disturbance over the past seven days.  
The following versions of the Sleep Disturbance short form (8 items) will be implemented in this study: adult self-report (ages 18+, high-functioning), pediatric self-report (adolescents aged 15 to -17 years, high-functioning) . In addition, proxy forms completed 
by [CONTACT_852493] , as well as low -functioning adults.

(PROMIS) Sleep -Related Impairment Questionnaire Short Form  
The PROMIS Sleep-Related Impairment Short Form ( Buysse et al 2010 ) focuses on 
self-reported perceptions of waking alertness, sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], and function within the context 
of overall sleep-wake function. This questionnaire assesses sleep-related impai rment 
over the past seven days. 
The following versions of the PROMIS  Sleep-Related Impairment Short Form (8 items) 
will be implemented in this study: adult self-report (ages 18+, high-functioning), pediatric 
self-report (ages 15 to 17, high-functioning) . In addition, proxy forms completed by [CONTACT_852494] , as well as low -functioning adults.  
This assessment takes approximately 5 minutes to perform.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Entry and Exit Questions 
Support persons will be asked a set of entry questions at baseline about their expectations regarding the study drug and about the skills or behaviors of the study participant they would like most to see improve.  
As a follow -up, at the Week 12 visit or Early Termination visit, support persons will be 
asked to report if they observed any changes in the skills or behaviors of the study participant during the study, as well as some feedback on the study drug. 
Both entry and exit questions will be answered on an electronic device. 
The entry and exit questions will take about 5 minutes to complete. 
8.1.6 Other Assessments  
For PD biomarker assessments see Section 8.7.1. 
8.2 SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
Planned timepoints for all safety assessments are provided in the SoA (Secti on 1.3). 
Safety assessments will consist of monitoring and recording AEs, including SAEs and 
non-serious adverse events of special interest (NSAESI); measurement of protocol -specified safety laboratory assessments; measurement of protocol -specified 
vital signs, ECGs; and other protocol -specified tests that are deemed critical to the 
safety evaluation of the study. 
 
RO7017773 —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
96/Protocol BP41316, Version 5 8.2.3 Vital Signs  
Vital signs will include temperature (tympanic), SBP and DBP, and pulse rate. They will 
be taken before blood collection and measured in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_96839] [ADDRESS_1185361]. At some timepoints, BP will also be measured in two positions (once 
supi[INVESTIGATOR_852429], 3 minutes later, standing) for orthostatic changes. At visits with dosing, vital signs and orthostatic changes will be measured pre-dose and postdose (for 
frequency see SoA (Section 1.3).  
Blood pressure and pulse measurements will be assessed obtained in a quiet room at a comfortable temperature, with the participant's arm unconstrained by [CONTACT_852495] a completely automated device with a digital readout throughout the study. Manual techniques will be used only if an automated device is not available. When possible, the same arm should be used for all blood pressure measurements. 
8.2.4 Electrocardiograms 
Triplicate 12 -lead ECGs will be obtained as outlined in the SoA (see Section 1.3) using 
an ECG machine that automatically calculates the HR and measures QRS complex, PR, QT, and QTc intervals.  
The three individual ECG tracings should be obtained as closely as possible in succession, but no more than [ADDRESS_1185362] 
10 minutes prior to each ECG evaluation. Body position should be consistently maintained for each ECG evaluation to prevent changes in HR. Environmental distractions (e.g., television, radio, conversation) should be avoided during the pre-ECG resting period and during ECG recording. ECGs should be performed prior to meals and any scheduled vital sign measurements and blood draws. 
In some cases, it may be appropriate to repeat abnormal ECGs to rule out improper lead 
placement as contributing to the ECG abnormality.  
If any values at or beyond the protocol -defined parameters are detected from the 
machine reading, an expedited review by [CONTACT_852496].  
For safety monitoring purposes, the Investigator or designee must review, sign, and date 
all ECG tracings. Paper or electronic copi[INVESTIGATOR_260046]’s permanent study file at the site.  
 
RO7017773 —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
97/Protocol BP41316, Version 5 The recordings will be electronically transferred to a central ECG analysis vendor. The 
following parameters will be obtained from the digital recordings: heart rate, QRS duration, PQ (PR), RR and QT intervals (QTcB (Bazett’s correction) and QTcF (Fridericia’s correction) as well as information on T-wave and U -wave. Changes in 
T-wave and U-wave morphology and overall ECG interpretation will be documented on the eCRF or may be sent electronically. If considered appropriate by [CONTACT_26702], ECGs may be analyzed retrospectively at a central laboratory.  
ECG characteristics, including HR, QRS duration, and PR, and QT intervals, will be recorded on the eCRF or loaded electronically. QTcF, QTcB and RR interval will be calculated automatically and recorded on the eCRF or loaded automatically. T-wave information will be captured as normal or abnormal and U -wave information will be 
captured in two categories: absent/normal or abnormal. 
8.2.[ADDRESS_1185363] be conducted in accordance with the separate 
laboratory manual and the SoA (Section 1.3). 
The Investigator must review the laboratory report, document this review, and record any clinically relevant changes occurring during the study in the AE section of the eCRF. The laboratory reports must be filed with the source documents. Clinically signif icant 
abnormal laboratory findings are those which are not associated with the underlying 
disease, unless judged by [CONTACT_78782]'s condition.  
• In the event of unexplained abnormal clinically significant laboratory test values, the 
tests should be repeated immediately and followed up until they have returned to the 
normal range and/or an adequate explanation of the abnormality is found. 
• If such values do not return to normal/baseline within a period of time judged 
reasonable by [CONTACT_737], the etiology should be identified and the Sponsor notified.  
• If laboratory values from non-protocol specified laboratory assessments performed at 
the local laboratory require a change in participant management or are considered clinically significant by [CONTACT_737] (e.g., SAE or AE or dose-modification) then, 
the results must be recorded in the eCRF.  
 
Additional blood or urine samples may be taken at the discretion of the Investigator if the 
results of any test fall outside the reference ranges, or clinical symptoms necessitate additional testing to monitor participant safety. 
 
RO7017773 —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
99/Protocol BP41316, Version 5 8.3 ADVERSE EVENTS AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT S 
The definitions of an AE or SAE can be found in Appendix  2. The NSAESI and disease-
related events and/or disease-related outcomes not qualifying as AEs or SAEs are 
discussed in Section 8.3.6 and Section 8.3.7. 
The Investigator and any qualified designees are responsible for ensuring that all AEs (including assessment of seriousness, severity and causality; see Appendix  2) are 
recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and reported to the Sponsor in accordance with instructions provided in this section and in Appendix  2. 
Procedures used for recording AEs are provided in Appendix  3. 
8.3.1 Time Period and Frequency for Collecting Adverse Event and 
Serious Adverse Event I nformation 
The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of AEs and SAEs and the 
procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in Appendix  2. 
Investigators will seek information on AEs at each participant’s contact. All AEs , whether 
reported by [CONTACT_260060], will be recorded in the participant’s medical record and on the Adverse Event eCRF as follows: 
After informed consent has been obtained but prior to initiation of study treatment , 
only SAEs caused by a protocol -mandated intervention should be reported. Any other 
AEs should not be reported. 
After initiation of study treatment , all AEs , regardless of relationship to study 
treatment, will be reported until the last follow-up visit (approximately [ADDRESS_1185364] dosing; see SoA in Section 1.3). 
Post -study AEs and SAEs: The Investigator is not required to actively monitor 
participants for AEs after the end of the AE reporting period after the last follow -up visit 
(approximately [ADDRESS_1185365] dosing; see SoA in Section 1.3).  
However, if the Investigator learns of any SAE (including a death) or other AEs of 
concern that are believed to be related to prior treatment with study treatment, at any  
time after a participant has been discharged from the study, and the Investigator considers the event to be reasonably related to the study treatment or study participation, the Investigator must promptly notify the Sponsor . For the procedure of 
reporting, see Appendix  2. 
 
RO7017773 —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
100/Protocol BP41316, Version 5 8.3.2 Method of Detecting Adverse Events and Serious Adverse 
Events  
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open-ended 
and non
-leading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire 
about AE occurrence.  
A consistent methodology of non-directive questioning should be adopted for eliciting adverse event information at all  participant evaluation time-points.  
8.3.3 Follow -Up of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS] I nvestigator Follow -Up 
The Investigator should follow up each AE until the event has resolved to baseline grade or better, the event is assessed as stable by [CONTACT_737], the event is otherwise 
explained, the participant is lost to follow-up (Section 7.3), or the participant withdraws 
consent. Every effort should be made to follow all SAEs considered to be related to study treatment or study -related procedures until a final outcome can be reported. If a 
participant discontinues from the study early (as described in Section 4.1.2 and 
Section 7), all AEs should be followed up until they are resolved as long as the 
participant has not withdrawn consent.. 
During the study period, resolution of AEs (with dates) should be documented on the 
Adverse Event eCRF and in the participant’s medical record to facilitate source data 
verification. If, after follow -up, return to baseline status or stabilization cannot be 
established, an explanation should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  
All pregnancies reported during the study should be followed up until pregnancy 
outcome and reported according to the instructions provided in Section 8.3.5. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Sponsor Follow -Up 
For SAEs, NSAESI, and pregnancies, the Sponsor or a designee may follow up by [CONTACT_756], fax, electronic mail, and/or a monitoring visit to obtain additional case details and outcome information (e.g., from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8838], consultant reports, 
autopsy reports) in order to perform an independent medical assessment of the reported event. 
8.3.4 Regulatory Reporting Requirements for Serious Adverse 
Events  
Prompt notification (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see 
Appendix  2 for reporting instructions) by [CONTACT_852497] a study treatment under clinical investigation are met. 
 
RO7017773 —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
101/Protocol BP41316, Version 5 The Sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and 
other regulatory agencies about the safety of a study treatment under clinical investigation. The Sponsor will comply with country -specific regulatory requirements 
relating to safety reporting to the regulatory authority, Institutional Review Boards (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committees (IEC), and Investigators.  
Investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions (S[LOCATION_003]R) according to local regulatory requirements and Sponsor policy and forwarded to Investigators as necessary.  
An Investigator who receives an Investigator safety report describing an SAE or other specific safety information (e.g., summary or listing of SAEs) from the Sponsor will review and then, file it along with the Investigator’s Brochure and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements. 
For immediate and expedited reporting requirements from Investigator to Sponsor and 
from Sponsor to Health Authority, Investigators, IRB and EC, see Appendix  2. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Emergency Medical Contacts  
To ensure the safety of study participants, access to the Medical Monitors is available 24 hours a day 7 days a week. Details will be available separately. 
8.3.5 Pregnancy 
Female participants of childbearing potential will be instructed to immediately inform the Investigator if they become pregnant during the study or within 28 days after the final dose of study treatment.  
If a pregnancy is reported, the Investigator should inform the Sponsor within 24 hours of 
learning of the pregnancy and should follow the pregnancy reporting process as detailed in Appendix  5. 
Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (e.g., spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital anomalies, and ectopic pregnancy) are considered SAEs ( Appendix  5). 
8.3.[ADDRESS_1185366] (NSAESI) are required to be reported by 
[CONTACT_10550] (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Appendix  2 for reporting instructions).

recommendation by [CONTACT_852499][INVESTIGATOR_002] (https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.5698/1535-7597 -16.1.48):  
- In case of participants with a first seizure, the local emergency doctor should be called; the diagno stic 
workup as well as the treatment will depend on the type and duration of the seizure.  
- In case of participants with known seizures, the emergency medication (typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], intramuscular midazolam, intravenous (IV) lorazepam, or IV diazepam) should be given  after 3  to 5 minutes (as 
per local recommendation).  
Paradoxical reactions  • D
 epending upon severity, consider symptomatic 
treatment; if necessary take the advice of an emergency physician (treatment option: e.g., blood pressure management, physostigmine, flumazenil,

8.5 PHARMACOKINETICS 
Blood samples for the determination of plasma concentrations of RO7017773 will be 
collected as outlined in the SoA (see Section 1.3. Note: On visits Day [ADDRESS_1185370] or some food such that t max is reached 
after approximately  2 hours ). Following review of th e second  interim  analysis,  sampling 
on Day 1 may be reduced for adolescents to be similar to that for high - and low -
functioning  adults. This will be confirmed as part of the IMC  + SOC review of PK data 
from adolescent s. Plasma RO7017773 concentrations will be measured by a specific and 
validated LC -MS/MS method. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_852432]. Home nursing services may be provided, if feasible to 
collect blood samples at the participant’s household.  
If required, remaining PK samples may also be used for assay development/validation 
(e.g., for metabolites and measurement of exploratory biomarkers).  
The PK samples will be destroyed within 2 years after the date of final CSR. Details on sampling procedures, sample storage and shipment are given in the Sample Handling Manual.  
For participants who consent to RBR, leftover samples will be transferred to RBR (see 
Section 8.9). 
Drug concentration information that would unblind the study, will not be reported to investigative sites or blinded personnel until the study has been unblinded. 
Any changes in the timing or addition of timepoints for any planned study assessments

8.7 BIOMARKER ANALYSES  
The rationale for using these specific tests is provided in Section 4.2.3. 
8.7.1 Biomarkers 
[IP_ADDRESS] D igital Biomarkers 
At the pre-baseline visit, the support person and the participant will be provided with a 
study smartphone and smartwatch, a “sleep mat”, detailed instructions and training on 
how to use the technology , and, optionally , small Bluetooth transmitters (“beacons”). 
The number of “room beacons” should be based on the number of rooms within the 
participant’s home and their sociability level as reported by [CONTACT_852501], and at least one “more social” and one “less social” room beacon must be dispensed. The support person and participant will be instructed to place one “room beacon” in each separate room of the participant’s home (as appropriate) based on their sociability level (“more social” or “less social”). Regarding the “people beacons”, at least one will be dispensed to the support person, or a number to match the number of people living with the participant and that are eligible to carry a beacon. The support person and participant will be instructed to distribute the “people beacons” to each member of the household, where appropriate. The people beacons should be worn by [CONTACT_852502]. Any complementary information related to the dispensing of beacons can be reported in the “Dispense” eCRF’s form in the “comments” field. The beacons transmit a regular Bluetooth signal that is recorded by [CONTACT_226028], allowing for an estimation of the proximity of the beacon. The study phone and watch will 
have applications pre-installed, that include a collection of digital biomarker assessments, comprising surveys and active tasks, for the support person and participant to complete. The applications will collect:  
1) Smartphone data through user interaction (Active Tasks)  
Participants will be assessed with three  active tasks within the smartphone app. In 
total the active task s will last on average [ADDRESS_1185371] 5 minutes long to assess communication deficits. When not 
in use, the phone should be left in the participant’s living room on charge whenever possible. Throughout the day the phone will measure the volume of noise in the environment and the time that people spend speaking. The raw audio recordings (and so actual words spoken) will not be uploaded from the phone and will be automatically deleted from the phone. For more details on the audio recordings please see Appendix  11. 
 
RO7017773 —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
112/Protocol BP41316, Version 5 2) Smartphone and smartwatch data without user interaction (Passive Monitoring)  
The participant will be asked to wear a smartwatch each day for the continuous 
capture of behavioral and physiological data related to core and associated symptoms of ASD (‘passive monitoring’), including (a) body movement to characterize repetitive body movements, (b) heart-rate parameters as biomarkers of anxiety and stress, (c)  dereferenced geolocation and time information to characterize 
social behavior when outdoors, and (d) level and quality of background sound to 
characterize social interactions (recorded on smartphone) . 
The people beacons also include a button that should be pressed by [CONTACT_852503] a repetitive movement. This 
“tagging” of repetitive movements can also be performed in the smartphone app. To avoid over-burden, tagging needs not be done for every observed repetitive movement. However, for a successful assessment a substantial number of events (e.g., a few each day) need to be tagged. Furthermore, the support person should 
tag all  repetitive movements for a certain period of time (at least 2 hours) on a day of 
their own choice, i.e. to do “dense” tagging.  
3) P
articipant and Study -Partner Reported Outcomes on smartphone (Surveys)  
Once per month questions on HRQoL (EuroQol 5-Dimension, 5-Level Questionnaire [EQ-5D -5L]) will be asked.
 
In addition, a sleep mat that will be placed by [CONTACT_852504]’s 
mattress and contains a sensor to detect body movement , breathing and heart-rate 
signals that will be used to collect data on sleep behavior. 
The ability of the participant to complete the active tasks will be assessed by [CONTACT_852505]-baseline visit and if any of the active tasks are not suitable for the participant, they will be deactivated on the study smartphone. Participants and support persons will have the opportunity to ask any questions they may have. During the study, at scheduled phone contact [CONTACT_852506], site personnel will follow -up on the participant’s 
progress. Adherence and technical status of the technology will be checked throughout the study, and the participant and support person will receive daily reminders to complete the active tasks and surveys, which may include calls from the site. The technology must be returned to the clinic at the end of the study and upon early termination. At those times, both the participant and the support person will be asked to complete satisfaction surveys on their experience using the technology during the study.  
Full details on the type of data captured and the methods used to ensure participant privacy are provided in Appendix  11.

113/Protocol BP41316, Version 5 [IP_ADDRESS] Hair Biomarkers  
The exposome assay will provide 4- to 6-hour molecular measurements  of physiological 
metabolites, environmental chemicals, and essential elements such as zinc  and copper. 
The metabolic and biochemical  dynamics of the participants, i.e., temporal changes in 
the levels of the different factors that are assessed, will be mapped from before the start 
of study drug administration throughout the treatment and follow -up periods  to identify 
which molecular pathways show a sustained response to the study drug (see SoA, 
Section 1.3). In addition to monitoring the temporal exposome of the participants at the 
molecular level, the hair assay may also assess  the levels of  RO7017773 and its 
metabolites to provide further information on the relationship of potential changes in the 
exposome with RO7017773 administration. Lastly, the data generated by [CONTACT_852507][INVESTIGATOR_852433]. Optional hair samples from support persons 
who provide consent will serve as a control.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Pharmacodynamic Biomarkers: Assessments of  
Neurophysiological Effects  
The PD biomarker assessments comprise resting state EEG and SPV (measured by 
[CONTACT_852508]). These assessments will be performed at the timepoints specified in the SoA (Section 1.3). Resting state EEG will be 
acquired in alternating 1 min blocks of eyes open and eyes closed while participants sit relaxed, following the recommendations of the International Pharmaco-EEG Society (Jobert et al 2012). Resting state data will be processed off- line to derive the beta power 
(12 to 30 Hz). During the oculomotor task, participants will be instructed to look at and follow a target stimulus on the screen, which switches horizontally from the screen center to either side at fixed amplitudes. Participants’ head movements will be reduced by [CONTACT_3553] a chin rest. The system will be initially calibrated to establish the conversion between EOG signals and eye movement amplitude. EOG data will be analyzed off-line to derive saccadic peak velocities.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Response Biomarkers: Eye- Tracking and Task EEG 
Biomarkers 
Eye-tracking and task EEG biomarkers will be acquired twice: before dosing and at the 
end of treatment (see SoA in Section 1.3).  
In the eye-tracking assessments, participants will be presented several static and dynamic visual stimuli while the eye-tracking system estimates their gaze position and pupil size. The visual stimuli include social (faces, people, activities, biological motion, etc.) and non-social elements (toys, objects, background furniture, etc.). Derived parameters will include time spent looking at specific stimuli type and image and video scanning patterns. Additionally, participants’ pupil constriction during pupi[INVESTIGATOR_852434].

inverted faces, and houses. Derived parameters for analyses will include event related 
potential component amplitudes and latencies.  
The response biomarker assessments will be performed after the PD biomarker  
assessments (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ) and are ordered  by [CONTACT_852509]. In 
case low- functioning participants are not able to complete the full set of response 
biomarkers (e.g. , because of  agitation or ina bility to wear the EEG cap for the duration 
of the entire task battery), the remaining tasks may be skipped.  
8.7.2 Genetic and Genomic Analyses  
[IP_ADDRESS] C linical Genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_852435], genetic analyses will be performed to possibly identify subgroups of individuals who benefit from RO7017773. 
A mandatory whole blood sample will be taken from every participant for DNA extraction (see SoA in Section 1.3 and Section 8.8.1). The DNA may be used for, but analysis is 
not limited to:  
• Genetic variants of pathways related to ASD, including but not limited to genes 
related to disease status, drug target, and treatment response. 
• Genetic variants of CYPs, transporters or receptors which might affect the metabolism, PK, PD, or safety  of RO7017773. 
Data arising from all biosamples will be subject to the same confidentiality as the rest of 
the study (see Appendix  1).  
[IP_ADDRESS] Whole Genome/Exome/Targeted DNA Analysis  
The sample collected for DNA extraction (see Section 8.8.1) includes, but is not limited 
to, genomic analysis and  may be sent to one or more laboratories for analysis of 
germline or somatic mutations via whole genome sequencing (WGS), whole exome sequencing (WES), next -generation sequencing (NGS), or other genomic analysis 
methods. 
Genomics is increasingly informing researchers' understanding of disease pathobiology. 
WGS provides a comprehensive characterization of the genome and, along with clinical data collected in this study, may increase the opportunity for developi[INVESTIGATOR_26630].

8.7.3 Overview of the Research Biosample Repository  
The [COMPANY_002] RBR is a centrally administered group of facilities for the long-term storage of human biologic samples,  including body fluids, solid tissues, and derivatives thereof 
(e.g., DNA, RNA, proteins, peptides). The collection, storage, and analysis of the RBR samples will facilitate the rational design of new pharmaceutical agents and the development of diagnostic  tests, which may allow for individualized drug therapy for 
patients in the future. 
Samples for the RBR will be collected from participants who give specific consent to 
participate in this optional RBR. Collected RBR samples will be used to achieve the following objectives: 
• To study the association of biomarkers with efficacy, AEs, or progressive disease.  
• To identify safety biomarkers that are associated with susceptibility to developi[INVESTIGATOR_852436].  
• To increase knowledge and understanding of disease biology and drug safety. 
• To study treatment response, including drug effects and the processes of drug 
absorption and disposition.  
• To develop biomarker or diagnostic assays and establish the performance characteris tics of these assays. 
 
8.8 BIOMARKER SAMPLES

8.[ADDRESS_1185375] be obtained before performing any study -specific screening tests or evaluations. Informed Consent Forms 
(ICFs) for enrolled participant and for participants who are not subsequently enrolled will be maintained at the study site. 
All screening assessments (related to entry criteria), must be completed and reviewed to 
confirm that participants meet all eligibility criteria. The Investigator will maintain a screening log to record details of all participants screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for screening failure. 
 
RO7017773 —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
118/Protocol BP41316, Version 5 Screening and pretreatment assessments (i.e., assessments at the pre -baseline and 
baseline visits) will be performed at the timepoints indicated in the SoA (see 
Section 1.3); however, in case of unexpected delays due to logistical or technical 
reasons (e.g., sickness of support persons or raters), the screening or pre-treatment 
period (see Figure 1 ) may be extended to up to 2 additional weeks. Beyond these 2 
weeks, the participant is considered a screen failure, but can be re-screened (see 
Section 5.4). 
Once all inclusion and exclusion criteria are met, the EAF (see Sections 1.3 and 8.2.1) is 
sent to the external vendor  as part of the screening process , ideally before the 
pre-baseline visit. T he Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_852439] a participant will be 
enrolled and may consult with the Sponsor  (Medical Monitor or designee)  for advice or 
clarification of any eligibility criteria. 
The Princip al Investigators are highly encouraged to use the voluntary eligibility 
consultation offered by [CONTACT_852510].  
For a participant to enter the randomized, double-blind treatment period the following criteria must be fulfilled:  
• No significant new or worsening psychiatric or medical illness since screening that in 
the opi[INVESTIGATOR_580950]’s ability to 
participate in the study. 
• No change in medications since screening.  
 
8.11.[ADDRESS_1185376] be performed as per SoA (see Section  1.3). The recommended 
order of assessments to be performed at the clinic will be defined in a separate 
document. The order of assessments may be adapted to allow efficient administration of all assessments at the site with the exception of assessments that have to be done at a specific time before or after taking the study drug as per SoA (see Section  1.3). The 
order of assessments that have to be taken at home is predefined on the electronic device for each participant (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). The site will contact [CONTACT_852511]/or new medication, to ensure compliance to the study drug and digital biomarker assessments as well as to administer questionnaires/scales/tests when appropriate as per SoA (see Section 1.3). 
 
RO7017773 —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
119/Protocol BP41316, Version 5 8.11.3 Assessments at Follow Up /Early Termination Visit  
Participants who complete the 12-week study treatment period will be asked to return to 
the clinic approximately [ADDRESS_1185377] dose of study treatment for 
safety follow -up visits (see Section 1.3).  
Assessments at the follow -up/early termination visits will be performed as indicated in 
the SoA (see Section 1.3). After the study completion/early termination visit, AEs should 
be followed as outlined in Sections  8.3.1 and 8.3.3. 
If participants discontinue from the study early (as described in Section 4.1.2 and 
Section 7), all efforts should be made to ask participants to return to the clinic for an 
early termination visit. All AEs should be followed up until they are resolved and 
additional unscheduled safety assessments  should be performed at Investigator’s 
discretion after discussion with the Medical Monitor if required. 
8.11.4 Assessments at Unscheduled Visits  
Unscheduled visits will be performed for safety reasons (e.g., for repetition of safety laboratory sampling). If due to a safety -related event a participant is unable to physically 
go to the site for an unscheduled visit, blood and urine samples may be collected by [CONTACT_852512].  
The unscheduled visit should be used to collect all assessments that are missing at that time.  
If a COA (see Section 8.1.5) cannot be completed during the visit or for a scale, the total 
score (e.g., the composite scores for Vineland -3) cannot be calculated with the 
available data, the scale should be repeated via the phone within the corresponding visit window or at an unscheduled visit as soon as possible (within the next 7 days). 
9. STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS 
9.1 ST ATISTICAL HYPOTHESES 
Because the nature of this Phase II study is purely hypothesis generating, no formal testing of a predefined null hypothesis is performed. 
9.2 SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION

For all participants, plasma concentrations of RO7017773 will be presented descriptively 
by [CONTACT_2715].  
Nonlinear mixed effects modeling may be used to analyze the sparse sampling dose 
versus concentration versus time data collected for RO7017773. The PK data c ollected 
in this study may be pooled with data from other clinical studies conducted with RO7017773. Population and individual PK parameters such as clearance and volume of distribution may be estimated, and the influence of various covariates such as age, gender, and body weight, on these parameters may be investigated. Secondary PK 
 
RO7017773 —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
123/Protocol BP41316, Version 5 parameters may be derived from the model as appropriate. The results of the analysis 
may be reported separately from the CSR.  
The participant’s exposure to RO7017773 may be assessed and correlated with selected efficacy, PD, biomarkers and safety parameters as appropriate.  
9.4.[ADDRESS_1185380] such optional interim efficacy analyses and the timing of these analyses will be documented in the Sponsor’s trial master file prior to the conduct of each interim analysis. The CSR will also 
document all interim analyses that occurred. All interim analyses will be performed and interpreted by [CONTACT_351321], external experts (SOC), and appropriate senior management personnel. IMC and SOC  members will be unblinded at the individual 
participant level, Sponsor senior management will be unblinded at the treatment group level. Access to treatment assignment information will follow the Sponsor’s standard procedures.  
The “IMC Agreement” will describe the planned interim analyses  in detail.

133/Protocol BP41316, Version 5 Appendix  1  
Regulatory, Ethical, and Study Oversight Considerations  
1. REGULATORY AND ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
1.1. CO MPLIANCE WITH  LAWS AND REGULATIONS 
This study will be conducted in full conformance with the ICH E6 guideline for Good 
Clinical Practice and the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, or the laws and regulations of the country in which the research is conducted, whichever affords the greater protection to the individual. The study will comply with the requirements of the ICH E2A guideline (Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting). Studies conducted in the [LOCATION_002] or under a U.S. Investigational New Drug (IND) application will comply with U.S. FDA regulations and applicable local, state, and federal laws. Studies conducted in the EU/EEA will comply 
with the EU Clinical Trial Directive (2001/20/EC). 
1.2. INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD OR ETHICS COMMITTEE  
This protocol, the ICFs, any information to be given to the participant (e.g., advertisements, diaries, etc.), and relevant supporting information must be submitted to the IRB/EC by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_25684]/EC before the study is initiated. In addition, any participant recruitment materials must be approved by [CONTACT_1201]/EC.  
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_25685]/EC
 annually or more frequently in accordance with the 
requirements, policies, and procedures established by [CONTACT_1201]/EC. Investigators are also responsible for promptly informing the IRB/EC of any protocol amendments (Section 2.3.1 
of this  Appendix  1). 
The Investigator should follow the requirements for reporting all AEs to the Sponsor. 
Investigators may receive written IND safety reports or other safety ‑related 
communications from the Sponsor. Investigators are responsible for ensuring that such 
reports are reviewed and processed in accordance with Health Authority requirements and the policies and procedures established by [CONTACT_11577]/EC, and archived in the site’s study file.  
1.3. INFORMED CONSENT 
The Sponsor’s Master Informed Consent Form (and ancillary sample ICFs such as a Child’s Assent or Support person's Informed Consent Form, if applicable) will be provided to each site. If applicable, it will be provided in a certified translation of the local language. Participants must be informed that their participation is voluntary. Participants or their legally authorized representative will be required to sign a statement of informed 
 
RO7017773 —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
134/Protocol BP41316, Version [ADDRESS_1185391] (HIPAA) requirements, where applicable, and the IRB/IEC or study center. The Sponsor or its designee must revi ew 
and approve any proposed deviations from the Sponsor's sample ICFs or any alternate consent forms proposed by [CONTACT_779] (collectively, the “Consent Forms”) before IRB/EC 
submission. The final IRB/EC ‑approved Consent Forms must be provided to the 
Sponsor for Health Authority submission purposes according to local requirements. 
Participants must be re-consented to the most current version of the ICF(s) during their 
participation in the study. A copy of the ICF(s) signed by [CONTACT_852515]’s legally authorized representative. 
In this study, support person specific information will be collected to evaluate support 
person burden requiring that a separate written informed consent be obtained from the support per son. A separate, specific signature [CONTACT_22862] a support 
person’s agreement to provide optional hair samples. Support persons who decline to participate will not provide a separate signature. 
The ICFs must be signed and dated by [CONTACT_98901]’s legally 
authorized representative before his or her participation in the study. The case history or clinical records for each participant shall document the informed consent process and that written informed consent was obtained prior to participation in the study.  
The ICFs should be revised whenever there are changes to study procedures or when new information becomes available that may affect the willingness of the participant to take part. The final revised IRB/EC -approved ICFs must be provided to the Sponsor for 
Health Authority submission purposes if required as per local regulations. 
If the ICFs are revised (through an amendment or an addendum) while a participant is 
participating in the study, the participant or a legally authorized representative may be re-consented by [CONTACT_852516], in accordance with applicable laws and IRB/EC policy). For any updated or revised ICFs, the case history or clinical records for each participant shall document the informed consent process and that written informed consent was obtained using the updated/revised ICFs for continued participation in the study. The study team will provide guidance for which participants need to re-consent in the event of an update to the Consent form.  
A copy of each signed ICFs must be provided to the participant or the participant’s legally authorized representative. All signed and dated ICFs must remain in each participant’s study file or in the site file and must be available for verification by [CONTACT_9534].  
 
RO7017773 —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
135/Protocol BP41316, Version 5 A participant who is re-screened is not required to sign another ICF if the re-screening 
occurs within 60 days from the previous ICF signature [CONTACT_568].  
Consent to Participate in the Research Biosample Repository  
The ICF will contain a separate section that addresses participation in the RBR. The Investigator or authorized designee will explain to each participant the objectives, methods, and potential hazards of participation in the RBR. Participants will be told that they are free to refuse to participate and may withdraw their samples at any time and for any reason during the storage period. A separate, specific signature [CONTACT_22862] a participant’s agreement to provide optional RBR samples. Participants who decline to participate will not provide a separate signature. 
The Investigator should document whether or not the participant has given consent to 
participate by [CONTACT_375490]. 
In the event of death or loss of competence of a participant who is participating in the 
Research, the participant's samples and data will continue to be used as part of the 
RBR.  
For sites in the [LOCATION_002], each ICF may also include patient authorization to allow use and disclosure of personal health information in compliance with the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). If the site utilizes a separate Authorization Form for participant authorization for use and disclosure of personal health information under the HIPAA regulations, the review, approval, and other processes outlined above apply except that IRB review and approval may not be required per study site policies.  
Approval  by [CONTACT_852517], storage, and analysis of RBR samples is contingent upon the review and 
approval of the exploratory research and the RBR portion of the ICF by [CONTACT_25733]'s IRB/EC and, if applicable, an appropriate regulatory body. If a site has not been granted approval for RBR sampling, this section of the protocol will not be applicable at that site  
Withdrawal from the Research Biosample Repository 
Participants who give consent to provide samples for the RBR have the right to withdraw their samples at any time for any reason. If a participant wishes to withdraw consent to 
the testing of his or her samples, the Investigator must inform the Medical Monitor and Site Monitor in writing of the participant’s wishes using the RBR Withdrawal Form and, if the study is ongoing, must enter the date of withdrawal on the RBR Withdrawal of Informed Consent eCRF. The participant will be provided with instructions on how to withdraw consent after the study is closed. A participant's withdrawal from Study BP41316 does not, by [CONTACT_5071], constitute withdrawal of samples from the RBR. Likewise, a 
 
RO7017773 —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
136/Protocol BP41316, Version 5 participant’s withdrawal from the RBR does not constitute withdrawal from Study 
BP41316. Data already generated before time of withdrawal of consent to RBR will still 
be used.  
1.4. CONFIDENTIALITY  
Participants will be assigned a unique identifier by [CONTACT_1034]. Any participant records or datasets that are transferred to the Sponsor will contain the identifier only; participant names or any information which would make the participant identifiable will not be transferred.  
The participant must be informed that his/her personal study -related data will be used by 
[CONTACT_9324]. The level of disclosure must also be explained to the participant.  
Medical information may be given to a participant’s personal physician or other appropriate medical personnel responsible for the participant’s welfare, for treatment purposes.  
The participant must be informed that his/her medical records may be examined by [CONTACT_9325], by [CONTACT_6667]/IEC members, and by [CONTACT_6668].  
Study data may be submitted to government or other health research databases or shared with resear chers, government agencies, companies, or other groups that are not 
participating in this study. These data may be combined with or linked to other data and used for research purposes, to advance science and public health, or for analysis, development, and commercialization of products to treat and diagnose disease. In 
addition, redacted clinical study reports and other summary reports will be provided upon request.  
Confidentiality for Research Biosample Repository  
Data generated from RBR samples must be available for inspection upon request by [CONTACT_436288], and [COMPANY_002] monitors, representatives, and collaborators, as appropriate. 
Participant medical information associated with RBR samples is confidential and may 
only be disclosed to third parties as permitted by [CONTACT_9535] (or separate authorization for 
use and disclosure of personal health information) signed by [CONTACT_2299], unless permitted or required by [CONTACT_2371]. 
 
RO7017773 —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
137/Protocol BP41316, Version [ADDRESS_1185392] sharing with other researchers. Participants will not be identified by [CONTACT_436289]. Given the complexity and exploratory nature of these analyses, genetic data and analyses will not be shared with Investigators or participants unless required by [CONTACT_2371]. 
Any inventions and resulting patents, improvements, and/or know -how originating from 
the use of the RBR sample data will become and remain the exclusive and unburdened 
property of the Sponsor, except where agreed otherwise. 
Monitoring and Oversight Research Biosample Repository  
Samples collected for the RBR will be tracked in a manner consistent with Good Clinical 
Practice by a quality -controlled, auditable, and appropriately validated laboratory 
information management system, to ensure compliance with data confidentiality as well as adherence to authorized use of samples as specified in this protocol and in the ICF. The Sponsor’s monitors and auditors will have direct access to appropriate parts of records relating to participant participation in RBR for the purposes of verifying the data provided to the Sponsor. The site will permit monitoring, audits, IRB/EC review, and Health Authority inspections by [CONTACT_852518].  
1.5. FINANCIAL DISCL OSURE  
Investigators will provide the Sponsor with sufficient, accurate financial information in accordance with local regulations to allow the Sponsor to submit complete and accurate financial certification or disclosure statements to the appropriate Health Authorities. Investigators are responsible for providing information on financial interests during the course of the study and for one year after completion of the study (i.e., LPLV). 
2. DATA HANDLING AND RE CORD  
2.1. DAT A COLLECTION  AND MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES  
2.1.1.  D ata Quality Assurance  
All participant data relating to the study will be recorded on printed or electronic CRF unless transmitted to the Sponsor or designee electronically (e.g., laboratory data). The Investigator is responsible for verifying that data entries are accurate and correct by 
[CONTACT_1189].  
 
RO7017773 —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
138/Protocol BP41316, Version [ADDRESS_1185393] maintain accurate documentation (source data) that supports the 
information entered in the CRF.  
The Investigator must permit study -related monitoring, audits, IRB/IEC review, and 
regulatory agency inspections and provide direct access to source data documents. 
The Sponsor or designee is responsible for the data management of this study including 
quality checking of the data. 
Study monitors will perform ongoing source data verification to confirm that data entered 
into the CRF by [CONTACT_1191], complete, and verifiable from source documents; that the safety and rights of participants are being protected; and that the study is being conducted in accordance with the currently approved protocol and any other study agreements, ICH GCP, and all applicable regulatory requirements. 
2.1.2.  Clinical Outcome Assessment Data 
[IP_ADDRESS] E lectronic Clinical Outcome Assessment Data  
An electronic clinical outcome assessment (eCOA ) device will be used to capture COA 
data. The data will be transmitted electronically to a centralized database at the eCOA vendor. Entries should be reviewed for completeness during the clinic visit. 
eCOA data will be collected using an electronic device provided by [CONTACT_436293]. 
The device is designed for entry of data in a way that is attributable, secure, and accurate, in compliance with U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations for electronic records (21 CFR Part 11). System backups for data stored by [CONTACT_260506]’s standard procedures.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Remote Administration of Electronic Clinical Outcome Assessments  
All caregiver- and patient -reported scales, forms, and interviews including the 
Vineland -3, CY-BOCS -ASD , and CGI  assessments  may be administered remotely at the 
participants’ home  if all requirements (see below) are fulfilled. This will reduce the 
duration of site visits  and burden on participants  and increase flexibility for both sites and 
study participants.  
Detailed guidance will be provided to the study sites for remote administration of e COA 
assessments by [CONTACT_852519]. Remote assessments should be scheduled within the corresponding visit window  and can only be done if the participants have access to a 
location where privacy can be assured and distractions kept to a minimum. In addition, 
the participants need access to suitable hardware, software, and internet connections. 
 
RO7017773 —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
139/Protocol BP41316, Version 5 Remote caregiver - and p atient -reported scales and forms will be performed using a 
secure screen -share connection with the site rater  connecting to the regular electronic  
device provided by [CONTACT_852519] (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]  above) and the participants 
connecting remotely from their home  or other suitable location . In case of unforeseen 
technical issues , the assessments may be done via  live videoconference or phone call 
with the site rater. Alternatively, devices for eCOA administration may be provided by [CONTACT_852520]. If the 
Vineland -3 or CY- BOCS -ASD assessments are administered remote ly at the 
participants’ home , a live videoconference with the C entral  Rater will be used. Only in 
case of unforeseen technical issues the interview may be completed over the phone.  
For a given participant and/or  support person, both on-site and remote assessments 
may be performed at individual study visits and for individual scales (i.e., they may 
choo se the mode of administration freely ). The mode of administration will be recorded 
on the eCOA device. 
2.1.3.  Source Data Records 
Source documents (paper or electronic) are those in which participant data are recorded 
and documented for the first time. They include, but are not limited to, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, COAs (paper or eCOA), evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_25683], microfiche, photographic negatives, microfilm or  magnetic media, X -rays, 
participant files, and records kept at pharmacies, laboratories, and medico‑ technical 
departments involved in a clinical study.  
Before study initiation, data to be entered directly into the eCRFs (i.e., no prior written or electronic record of the data) and considered source data must be defined in the Trial Monitoring Plan. 
Source documents that are required to verify the validity and completeness of data 
entered into the eCRFs must not be obliterated or destroyed and must be retained per the policy for retention of records described below. 
To facilitate source data verification, the Investigators and institutions must provide the

140/Protocol BP41316, Version 5 2.1.4.  Use of Computerized Systems 
When clinical observations are entered directly into an investigational site’s 
computerized medical record system (i.e., in lieu of original hardcopy records), the electronic record can serve as the source document if the system has been validated in accordance with Health Authority requirements pertaining to computerized systems used in clinical research. An acceptable computerized data collection system allows preservation of the original entry of data. If original data are modified, the system should maintain a viewable audit trail that shows the original data as well as the reason for the change, name [CONTACT_25773], and date of the change.  
2.1.5.  Safety Biomarker Data 
Adverse event reports will not be derived from safety biomarker data by [CONTACT_1034], and safety biomarker data will not be included in the formal safety analyses for this study. In addition, safety biomarker data will not inform decisions on participant 
management. 
2.2. RETENTION OF RECORDS  
Records and documents, including signed ICF, pertaining to the conduct of this study must be retained by [CONTACT_12103] [ADDRESS_1185394] 15 
years after study completion on approval by [CONTACT_1034]. No records may be destroyed during the retention period without the written approval of the Sponsor. 
For countries where Ethics Committees or the Ministry of Health will not approve audio 
recording of participant interviews, review of the scale worksheets, submitted as part of the assessment source information, will be performed to verify accuracy of scoring and adherence to study conventions.

142/Protocol BP41316, Version 5 2.3.3.  Dissemination of Clinical Study Data  
A clinical study report containing the results of this study will be made available to 
anyone who requests a copy. A description of this clinical study and a summary of its results will be available at http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov . 
2.3.4.  Management of Study Quality  
The Sponsor will implement a system to manage the quality of the study, focusing on processes and data that are essential to ensuring participant safety and data integrity. Prior to the first participant’s entry into the study, the Sponsor will identify and evaluate potential risks associated with critical trial processes and data and will implement controls for the communication, review, and reporting of these risks. Details regarding the applied approach for the study will be provided in the integrated Risk Based Quality 
Management Plan.  
Risk control includes the selection of risk -based parameters and establishing associated 
quality tolerance limits. Detection of deviations from defined quality tolerance limits will 
trigger an evaluation to determine if action is needed. Details on the management and 
review of quality tolerance limits will be provided in a separate Quality Tolerance Limit 
Plan. 
2.3.5.  Site Inspections 
Site visits will be conducted by [CONTACT_25758], participants’ medical records, and eCRFs. The Investigator will permit national and local Health Authorities, Sponsor monitors, representatives, and collaborators, and the IRBs/ECs to inspect facilities and records relevant to this study.  
3. ADMINISTRATIVE STRUC TURE 
The Sponsor of the study is F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd. The Sponsor is responsible for the study management, data management, statistical analysis and medical writing for the clinical study report.  
This study uses an Internal Monitoring Committee (IMC) plus Scientific Oversight 
Committee (SOC). Details are provided in Section 4.1.3.  
4. STUDY AND SITE CLOSURE  
The Sponsor (or designee) has the right to close the study site or terminate this study at any time. Reasons for terminating the study may include, but are not limited to, the following:  
• The incidence or severity of AEs in this or other studies indicates a potential health 
hazard to participants.  
 
RO7017773 —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
143/Protocol BP41316, Version 5 • Participant enrollment is unsatisfactory.  
 
The Sponsor will notify the Investigator and Health Authorities if the study is placed on 
hold, or if the Sponsor decides to discontinue the study or development program.  
Study sites will be closed upon study completion. A study site is considered closed when all required documents and study supplies have been collected and a study -site closure 
visit has been performed. 
The Investigator may initiate study -site closure at any time, provided there is reasonable 
cause and sufficient notice is given in advance of the intended termination. 
Reasons for the early closure of a study site by  [CONTACT_31202]: 
• Failure of the Investigator to comply with the protocol, the requirements of the 
IRB/IEC or local Health Authorities, the Sponsor's procedures, or GCP guidelines.  
• Inadequate recruitment of participants by [CONTACT_737].  
• Discontinuation of further study treatment development.

144/Protocol BP41316, Version 5 Appendix  2  
Adverse Events: Definitions and Procedures for Evaluating, 
Follow- up and Reporting  
1. DEFINITION OF ADVERSE EVENTS  
According to the E2A ICH guideline for Good Clinical Practice, an adverse event  is any 
untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal  relationship with this treatment. 
An AE can therefore be: 
• Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, 
whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.  
 
Events Meeting t
 he AE Definition:  
• D eterioration in a laboratory value (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) or 
other clinical test (e.g., ECG, X -ray) that is associated with symptoms or leads to a 
change in study treatment or concomitant treatment or discontinuation from study treatment (see Appendix  3, Section 4 ). 
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition, including either an increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.  
• New conditions detected or diagnosed after study treatment administration even though it may have been present before the start of the study. 
• Adverse events that are related to a protocol -mandated intervention, including those 
that occur prior to assignment of study treatment (e.g., screening invasive 
procedures such as biopsies).  
 
• "Lack of efficacy" or "failure of expected pharmacological action" per se will not be 
reported as an AE or SAE unless the progression is unexpectedly accelerated and not in line with the natural history of the disease. If the “Lack of efficacy” would not 
require safety reporting, such instances will be captured in the efficacy assessments. 
However, the signs, symptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of 
efficacy will be reported as AE or SAE if they fulfill the definition of an AE or SAE.  
  
Events NO
 T Meeting the AE Definition:  
• A ny clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safety 
assessments which are associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by [CONTACT_13142]’s condition. 
 
RO7017773 —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
145/Protocol BP41316, Version 5 • The disease/disorder being studied or expected progressi on, signs, or symptoms of 
the disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the 
participant’s condition.  
• Medical or surgical procedure (e.g., endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that leads to the procedure is an AE. 
• Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]). 
• Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre-existing disease(s) or condition(s) present 
or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen. 
 
2. DEFINITION OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be a serious adverse event 
(SAE) even if serious conditions are met (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1080]/symptoms of the disease under study, death due to progression of disease).  
A serious adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death. 
• Is life-threatening. 
The term "life-threatening" in the definition of "serious" refers to an event in which the 
participant was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it was more severe. 
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
(see Appendix  3). 
In general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_19949] (usually 
involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_852443]/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or outpatient setting. Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1084]. If a complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9236], the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious.  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a pre-existing condition that did not worsen from baseline is not considered an AE . 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
Disability means substantial disruption of the participant’s ability to conduct normal life functions. 
 
RO7017773 —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
146/Protocol BP41316, Version 5 This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical 
significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle) which may interfere with or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
• Other significant events: 
Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE 
reporting is appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_22772]. These events should usually be considered serious.  
Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
3. RECORDING OF ADVERSE EVENT AND/OR SERIOUS 
ADVERSE EVENT  
When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the Investigator to review all  
documentation (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1088], laboratory reports, and diagnostics reports) related to the event. 
The Investigator will then record all relevant AE/SAE information in the CRF.  
It is not  acceptable for the Investigator to send photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_10914]’s medical 
records to Medical Monitor in lieu of completion of the eCRF. There may be instances when copi[INVESTIGATOR_375418]. In this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of the participant number, will be redacted on the copi[INVESTIGATOR_47957]. 
The Investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, 
symptoms, and/or other clinical information. Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not the individual signs/symptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE. 
 
RO7017773 —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
147/Protocol BP41316, Version 5 3.1. ASSESSMENT OF SEVERITY  
The Investigator will make an assessment of severity for each AE and SAE reported 
during the study and assign it to one of the categories provided in Table 1 (as guidance 
for assessing adverse event severity). Further guidance on grading non -serious adverse 
events of special interest with regard to somnolence and sleep is provided in Appendix  9. 
The terms “severe” and “serious” are not synonymous. Severity refers to the intensity of an adverse event (rated as mild, moderate, or severe, or according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [NCI CTCAE V5.0] criteria); the event itself may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache without any further findings). 
Severity and seriousness need to be independently assessed for each adverse event 
recorded on the eCRF. 
Serious adverse events are required to be reported by [CONTACT_144391] (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event). 
Table [ADDRESS_1185396] normal daily activity  
Severe  Incapacitating with inability to work or to perform normal daily activity  
Note: Regardless of severity, some events may also meet seriousness criteria. Refer to 
definition of a serious adverse e vent (see above).   
3.2. ASSESSMENT OF CA[LOCATION_003]LITY  
Investigators should use their knowledge of the participant, the circumstances surrounding the event, and an evaluation of any potential alternative causes to determine whether or not an adverse event is considered to be related to the study treatment, indicating "yes" or "no" accordingly. The following guidance should be taken into consideration: 
• Temporal relationship of event onset to the initiation of study treatment. 
• Course of the event, considering especially the effects of dose-reduction, 
discontinuation of study treatment, or reintroduction of study treatment. 
• Known association of the event with the study treatment or with similar treatments. 
• Known association of the event with the disease under study.  
• Presence of risk factors in the participant or use of concomitant medications known to increase the occurrence of the event. 
 
RO7017773 —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
148/Protocol BP41316, Version 5 • Presence of non-treatment-related factors that are known to be associated with the 
occurrence of the event. 
 
For participant receiving combination therapy, causality will be assessed individually for 
each protocol -mandated therapy. 
4. FOLLOW -UP OF AES AND SAES 
The Investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by [CONTACT_852521]/or causality of the AE or SAE as fully as possible. This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals.  
If a participant dies during participation in the study or during a recognized follow -up 
period, the Investigator will provide the Sponsor with a copy of any post-mortem findings including histopathology when available 
New or updated information will be recorded in the originally completed eCRF.  
The Investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the Sponsor within [ADDRESS_1185397] report such events to the Sponsor immediately; under no circumstances should reporting take 
place more than [ADDRESS_1185398] report to the Sponsor within 24 hours after learning of the event, regardless of relationship to study treatment: 
• Seriou s adverse events  
• Non-serious adverse events of special interest (NSAESI) (see Section 8.3.6) 
• Pregnancies (see Section 8.3.5) 
 
The Investigator must report new significant follow -up information for these events to the 
Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after becoming aware of the 
information). New significant information includes the following: 
• New signs or symptoms or a change in the diagnosis.  
• Signi ficant new diagnostic test results. 
 
RO7017773 —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
149/Protocol BP41316, Version 5 • Change in causality based on new information. 
• Change in the event’s outcome, including recovery.  
• Additional narrative information on the clinical course of the event. 
 
Investigators must also comply with local requirements for reporting serious adverse 
events to the local Health Authority and IRB/EC.  
5.[ADDRESS_1185399]  
Events  that Occur prior to Study Treatment Initiation 
After informed consent has been obtained but prior to initiation of study treatment, only 
serious adverse events caused by a protocol -mandated intervention should be reported. 
The Serious Adverse Event/Adverse Event of Special Interest Reporting Form provided to Investigators should be completed and submitted to the Serious Adverse Event Responsible immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event). 
Events that Occur after Study Treatment Initiation 
For reports of serious adverse events and non-serious adverse events of special interest 
(Section 8.3.6) that occur after initiation of study treatment (Section 8.3.1), Investigators 
should record all case details that can be gathered immediately (i.e., within 24 hours after learning of the event) on the appropriate Adverse Event of Special Interest/ Serious Adverse Event eCRF form and submit the report via the electronic data capture (EDC) system. A report will be generated and sent to the Sponsor’s Safety Risk Management department. 
In the event that the EDC system is unavailable, the Serious Adverse Event/Adverse 
Event of Special Interest Reporting Form provided to Investigators should be completed and submitted to the Serious Adverse Event Responsible immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours  after learning of the event). 
Once the EDC system is available, all information will need to be entered and submitted 
via the EDC system. 
Reporting of Post -Study Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events 
If the Investigator becomes aware of any other serious adverse event occurring after the 
end of the AE reporting period, if the event is believed to be related to prior study treatment the event should be reported directly to the Sponsor or its designee, either by 
 
[INVESTIGATOR_274317]7017773 —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
150/Protocol BP41316, Version 5 faxing or by [CONTACT_852522]. 
5.2 REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR CASES OF  OVERDOSE, 
MEDICATION ERROR, DRUG ABUSE, OR DRUG MISUSE  
Overdose (accidental or intentional), medication error, drug abuse, and drug misuse} 
(hereafter collectively referred to as "special situations"), are defined as follows: 
• Accidental overdose: accidental administration of a drug in a quantity that is higher 
than the assigned dose  
• Intentional overdose: intentional administration of a drug in a quantity that is higher 
than the assigned dose}  
• Medication error: accidental deviation in the administration of a drug  
• In some cases, a medication error may be intercepted prior to administration of the 
drug. 
• Drug abuse: intentional excessive use of a drug that may lead to addiction or dependence, physical harm, and/or psychological harm}  
• Drug misuse: intentional deviation in the administration of a drug that does not qualify as drug abuse  
In cases where drug is to be self-administered by [CONTACT_2299], drug misuse 
could involve the drug being administered to someone other than the 
participant.  
 
Special situations are not in themselves adverse events, but may result in adverse 
events. Each adverse event associated with a special situation should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF. If the associated adverse event fulfills seriousness criteria, the event should be reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event). For RO7017773 and placebo, 
adverse events associated with special situations should be recorded as described below for each situation:  
• Accidental overdose: Enter the adverse event term. Check the "Accidental overdose" 
and "Medication error" boxes. 
• Intentional overdose: Enter the adverse event term. Check the "Intentional overdose" 
box. If drug abuse is suspected, check the "Drug abuse" box. If drug abuse is not 
suspected, check the "Drug misuse" box. 
• Medication error that does not qualify as an overdose: Enter the adverse event term . 
Check the "Medication error" box.  
• Medication error that qualifies as an overdose: Enter the adverse event term. Check the "Accidental overdose" and "Medication error" boxes.

• Drug misuse that qualifies as an overdose: Enter the adverse event term. Check the 
"Intentional overdose" and "Drug misuse" boxes. 
 
In addition, all special situations associated with RO7017773 and placebo, regardless of 
whether they result in an adverse event, should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and should be recorded as described below: 
• Accidental overdose: Enter the drug name [INVESTIGATOR_1238] "accidental overdose" as the event 
term. Check the "Accidental overdose" and "Medication error" boxes. 
• Intentional overdose: Enter the drug name [INVESTIGATOR_1238] "intentional overdose" as the event 
term. Check the "Intentional overdose" box. If drug abuse is suspected, check the 
"Drug abuse" box. If drug abuse is not suspected, check the "Drug misuse" box. 
• Medication error that does not qualify as an overdose: Enter the name [CONTACT_26865] a description of the error (e.g., wrong dose administered, wrong 
dosing schedule, incorrect route of administration, wrong drug, expi[INVESTIGATOR_679392]) as the event term. Check the "Medication error" box.  
• Medication error that qualifies as an overdose: Enter the drug name [INVESTIGATOR_1238] "accidental 
overdose" as the event term. Check the "Accidental overdose" and "Medication 
error" boxes. Enter a description of the error in the additional case details. 
• Intercepted medication error: Enter the drug name [INVESTIGATOR_1238] "intercepted medication error" 
as the event term. Check the "Medication error" box. Enter a description of the error 
in the additional case details . 
• Drug abuse that does not qualify as an overdose: Enter the drug name [INVESTIGATOR_1238] "drug abuse" as the event term. Check the "Drug abuse" box.  
• Drug abuse that qualifies as an overdose: Enter the drug name [INVESTIGATOR_1238] "intentional 
overdose" as the event term. Check the "Intentional overdose" and "Drug abuse" boxes. 
• Drug misuse that does not qualify as an overdose: Enter the drug name [INVESTIGATOR_1238] "drug 
misuse" as the event term. Check the "Drug misuse" box. 
• Drug misuse that qualifies as an overdose: Enter the drug name [INVESTIGATOR_1238] "intentional 
overdose" as the event term. Check the "Intentional overdose" and "Drug misuse" 
boxes.

"patient supplied drug to third party" as the event term. Check the "Drug misuse" 
box. 
 
As an example, an accidental overdose that resulted in a headache would require the completion of two Adverse Event eCRF pages, one to report the accidental overdose 
and one to report the headache. The "Accidental overdose" and "Medication error" 
boxes  would need to be checked on both eCRF pages. 
6. EXPEDITED REPORTING TO HEALTH AUTHORITIES, 
INVESTIGATORS, INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARDS, AND ETHICS COMMITTEES  
The Sponsor will promptly evaluate all serious adverse events and NSAESI against 
cumulative product experience to identify and expeditiously communicate possible new safety findings to Investigators, IRBs, ECs, and applicable Health Authorities based on 
applicable legislation.  
To determine reporting requirements for single adverse event cases, the Sponsor will 
assess the expectedness of these events through use of the reference safety 
information in the document listed below: 
Drug  Document  
RO7017773  RO7017773 Investigator's Brochure   
 The Sponsor will compare the severity of each event and the cumulative event 
frequency reported for the study with the severity and frequency reported in the 
applicable reference document. 
Reporting requirements will also be based on the Investigator's assessment of causality 
and seriousness, with allowance for upgrading by [CONTACT_25753]. 
 
RO7017773 —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
153/Protocol BP41316, Version [ADDRESS_1185400] medical terminology/concepts when recording adverse 
events on the Adverse Event eCRF. Avoid colloquialisms and abbreviations. 
Only one adverse event term should be recorded in the event field on the Adverse Event 
eCRF.  
1. DIAGNOSIS VERSUS SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS 
A diagnosis (if known) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF rather than individual signs and symptoms  (e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than 
jaundice, asterixis, and elevated transaminases). However, if a constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be medically characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, each individual event should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. If a diagnosis is subsequently established, all previously reported adverse events based on signs and symptoms should be nullified and replaced by [CONTACT_25746], with a starting date that corresponds to the starting date of the first symptom of the eventual diagnosis. 
2. ADVERSE EVENTS OCCURRING SECONDARY TO OT HER 
EVENTS  
In general, adverse events occurring secondary to other events (e.g., cascade events or clinical sequelae) should be identified by [CONTACT_5252], with the exception of severe or serious secondary events. However, medically significant adverse events occurring secondary to an initiating event that are separated in time should be recorded as independent events on the Adverse Event eCRF. For example: 
• If vomiting results in mild dehydration with no additional treatment in a healthy adult, 
only vomiting should be reported on the eCRF. 
• If vomiting results in severe dehydration, both events should be reported separately on the eCRF. 
• If a severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage leads to renal failure, both events should be reported separately on the eCRF.  
• If dizziness leads to a fall and subsequent fracture, all three events should be reported separately on the eCRF.  
 
All adverse events should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF if it is 
unclear as to whether the events are associated.  
 
RO7017773 —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
154/Protocol BP41316, Version [ADDRESS_1185401] result should be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria: 
• Accompanied by [CONTACT_4659]. 
• Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment 
interruption, or treatment discontinuation). 
• Results in a medical intervention (e.g., potassium supplementation for hypokalemia) or a change in concomitant therapy. 
• Clinically significant in the Investigator’s judgment. 
 
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to review all laboratory findings. Medical and 
scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated laboratory 
abnormality should be classified as an adverse event. 
If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g., alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin 5 times the upper limit of normal [ULN] 
associated with cholecystitis), only the diagnosis (i.e., cholecystitis) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  
If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is not a sign of a disease or syndrome, the abnormality itself should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, along with a descriptor indicating if the test result is above or below the normal range (e.g., "elevated potassium", as opposed to "abnormal potassium"). If the laboratory abnormality can be characterized by a precise clinical term per standard definitions, the clinical term should be recorded as the adverse event. For example, an elevated serum potassium level of 7.0 mEq/L should be recorded as “hyperkalemia”. 
 
RO7017773 —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
155/Protocol BP41316, Version 5 Observations of the same clinically significant laboratory abnormality from visit to visit 
shoul d not be repeatedly recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, unless the etiology 
changes. The initial severity of the event should be recorded, and the severity or seriousness should be updated any time the event worsens. 
5. ABNORMAL VITAL SIGN VALUES  
Not every  vital sign abnormality qualifies as an adverse event. A vital sign result should 
be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria:  
• Accompanied by [CONTACT_4659]. 
• Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment 
interruption, or treatment discontinuation). 
• Results in a medical intervention or a change in concomitant therapy. 
• Clinically significant in the Investigator’s judgment. 
 
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to review all vital sign findings. Medical and scientific 
judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated vital sign abnormality should be classified as an adverse event. 
If a clinically significant vital sign abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g., high blood pressure), only the diagnosis (i.e., hypertension) should be recorded on 
the Adverse Event eCRF. 
Observations of the same clinically significant vital sign abnormality from visit to visit 
should not be repeatedly recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, unless the etiology changes. The initial severity of the event should be recorded, and the severity or seriousness should be updated any time the event worsens. 
6. ABNORMAL LIVER FUNCTION TESTS  
The finding of an elevated ALT or AST ( > 3 × ULN) in combination with either an elevated 
total bilirubin (>  2 × ULN) or clinical jaundice in the absence of cholestasis or other 
causes of hyperbilirubinemia is considered to be an indicator of severe liver injury. Therefore, Investigators must report as an adverse event the occurrence of either of the following:  
• Treatment-emergent ALT or AST
 > 3 × ULN in combination with total 
bilirubin  > 2 × ULN.  
• Treatment-emergent ALT or AST  > 3 × ULN in combination with clinical jaundice.  
 
The most appropriate diagnosis or (if a diagnosis cannot be established) the abnormal 
laboratory values should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Appendix  2) and 
 
RO7017773 —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
156/Protocol BP41316, Version 5 reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the 
event), either as a serious adverse event or a non-serious adverse event of special interest (see Section 8.3.6). 
7. DEATHS  
All deaths that occur during the protocol -specified adverse event reporting period (see 
Section 5 of Appendix  2), regardless of relationship to study treatment, must be recorded 
on the Adverse Event eCRF and immediately reported to the Sponsor. This includes death attributed to worsening of comorbidities related to ASD . 
Death should be considered an outcome and not a distinct event. The event or condition that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded as the single medical concept on the Adverse Event eCRF. Generally, only one such event should be reported. If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of reporting, “unexplained death” should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. If the cause of death later becomes available (e.g., after autopsy), “unexplained death” should be replaced by [CONTACT_25749]. The term "sudden death" should not be used unless combined with the presumed cause of death (e.g., "sudden cardiac death"). 
8. PREEXISTING MEDICAL CONDITIONS  
A preexisting medical condition is one that is present at the screening visit for this study. Such conditions should be recorded on the General Medical History and Baseline Conditions eCRF.  
A preexisting medical condition should be recorded as an adverse event only if the frequency, severity, or character of the condition worsens during the study. When recording such events on the Adverse Event eCRF, it is important to convey the concept that the preexisting condition has changed by [CONTACT_9672] (e.g., “more frequent headaches”).  
9. LACK OF EFFICACY OR WORSENING OF ASD  
Medical occurrences or symptoms of deterioration that are anticipated as part of ASD should be recorded as an adverse event if judged by [CONTACT_852523]. When recording an unanticipated worsening of ASD symptoms on the Adverse Event eCRF, it is important to convey the concept that the condition has changed by [CONTACT_9672] (e.g., ”worsening of repetitive behaviors”). 
 
RO7017773 —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
157/Protocol BP41316, Version 5 10. HOSPI[INVESTIGATOR_852444] a serious adverse event (per the definition of serious adverse event in Appendix 2 ), except as outlined below. 
An event that leads to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_852445] a serious adverse event: 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_25678] 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a preexisting condition, provided that all of the following criteria 
are met: 
The hospi[INVESTIGATOR_267496]. 
The participant has not suffered an adverse event. 
An event that leads to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_33405] a serious adverse event, but should be reported as an adverse event instead:  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_232631]. 
 
11. PATIENT -REPORTED OUT COME DATA (COA DATA 
REPORTED DIRECTLY BY [CONTACT_852524])  
Adverse event reports will not be derived from PRO data by [CONTACT_1034], and safety 
analyses will not be performed using PRO data. Sites are not expected to review the PRO data. [COMPANY_002]/Genentech study team will determine whether any PRO data elements may be indicative of a medically significant adverse event (e.g., suicidal ideation, worsening of depression, worsening of hemoptysis) and could necessitate real time review by [CONTACT_638729].

the event that the central laboratory results are not available in time for either study 
treatment administration and/or response evaluation. If a local sample is required, it is important that the sample for central analysis is obtained at the same time. Additionally, if the local laboratory results are used to make either a study treatment decision or response evaluation, the results must be captured in source documentation and entered as a comment into the eCRF}.  
Protocol -specific requirements for inclusion or exclusion of participants are detailed in 
Sections  5.[ADDRESS_1185403] variables measured will include:  
Laboratory Assessments  Parameters  
Hematology  • Leukocytes, erythrocytes, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelets, 
differential count (absolute) (neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, 
monocytes and lymphocytes)  
Clinical Chemistry  • Sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, glucose (non-fasting) 
urea (BUN), creatinine, creatine phosphokinase (CPK), total 
protein, albumin, phosphate, calcium, magnesium, total bilirubin, 
alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST), gamma -glutamyl transferase (γ -GT), 
lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), HbA1c and GLDH (this last parameter will be optional; to be tested if the participant has 
elevated liver enzyme levels).  
Coagulation  • Prothrombin time (INR), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) .  
 
RO7017773 —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
159/Protocol BP41316, Version 5 Laboratory Assessments  Parameters  
Viral Serology  • HIV (specific tests HIV-1 antibody, HIV -1/2 antibody, HIV -2 
antibody), hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis C virus 
(HCV) antibody.  
Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805]  • Total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides.  
Thyroid Hormones  • Thyroxine (Free T4), thyroid stimulating-hormone (TSH)  
Hormone  • Estradiol, follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH)  
Pregnancy Test  • All women of childbearing potential (including those who have had 
a tubal occlusion/ligation) will have a blood pregnancy test at 
screening. At specified subsequent visits , urine sample will be 
used; tests results will be evaluated by [CONTACT_779]’s local laboratory.  In 
case of a positive result on urine test, a confirmation with blood test has to be obtained.  
• Serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)  pregnancy test (as 
needed for women of childbearing potential).  
Urinalysis  • Dipstick: pH, glucose, protein, blood, will be performed at the study 
center  (or directly at the participant’s home in case of an 
unscheduled home visit, see Section 8.11.4) .  
• If there is a clinically significant positive result, urine will be sent to the central laboratory for  repeat urinalysis and reflex  microscopy 
and culture, as needed. As per operator judgement, a second 
dipstick testing can be conducted beforehand for confirmation of the positive result. If there is an explanation for the positive dipstick 
results (e.g., menses), it should be recorded and there is no need to perform microscopy and culture.  
• Microscopic examination (sediment, RBCs, WBCs, casts, crystals, epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663], bacteria), if blood or protein is abnormal.  
Other Tests  
• Urine alcohol and drug screen (to include the following: 
amphetamines, barbiturates, cocaine, opi[INVESTIGATOR_858], cannabinoids and benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651]).  
• SARS-CoV -2 could be tested through serology and/or respi[INVESTIGATOR_852446]/or at any time during the study.  
 
 
RO7017773 —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
160/Protocol BP41316, Version [ADDRESS_1185404] document their review of each laboratory safety report. 
Based on continuous analysis of the data in this study, the Sponsor may decide at any 
time to stop the collection of any sample type not considered to be critical for safety if the data from the samples collected does not produce useful information. 
Additional Statistical Considerations for Clinical Laboratory Data 
• Standard Reference Ranges and Transformation of Data 
Potential analysis considerations for analyzing laboratory data include the use of 
Standard Reference Ranges and potential transformation of data for specific lab tests.  
In this scenario, [COMPANY_002] standard reference ranges, rather than the reference ranges of 
the Investigator, can be used for specific parameters. For these parameters, the 
measured laboratory test result will be assessed directly using the [COMPANY_002] standard reference range. Certain laboratory parameters will be transformed to [COMPANY_002]’s standard 
reference ranges.  
A transformation will be performed on certain laboratory tests that lack sufficiently 
common procedures and have a wide range of Investigator ranges, e.g., enzyme tests that include AST, ALT, and alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin. Since the standard reference ranges for these parameters have a lower limit of zero, only the upper limits of the ranges will be used in transforming the data.  
• Definition of Laboratory Abnormali ties 
For all laboratory parameters included in the analysis described above, there exists a [COMPANY_002] predefined standard reference range. Laboratory values falling outside this standard reference range will be labeled “H” for high or “L” for low in participant listings 
of laboratory data. 
In addition to the standard reference range, a marked reference range has been 
predefined by [CONTACT_436301]. The marked reference range is broader than the standard reference range. Values falling outside the marked reference range that also represent a defined change from baseline will be considered marked laboratory abnormalities (i.e., potentially clinically relevant). If a baseline value is not available for a participant, the midpoint of the standard reference range will be used as the participant’s baseline value for the purposes of determining marked laboratory abnormalities. Marked laboratory abnormalities will be labeled in the participant listings 
as “HH” for very high or “LL” for very low.

Contraceptive Guidance and Collection of Pregnancy 
Information  
1. DEFINITIONS  
• Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP)  
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming post-menopausal 
unless permanently sterile. The definition of childbearing potential may be adapted for alignment with local guidelines or requirements. 
• Women in the following categories are considered to be Woman of Non-
Childbearing Potential (WONCBP)  
a) Pre-menarchal  
b) Pre-menopausal female with one of the following:  
– Documented hysterectomy.  
– Documented bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656].  
– Documented bilateral oophorectomy.  
Note: Documentation can come from the site personnel’s: review of participant’s 
medical records, medical examination, or medical history interview.  
c) Post-menopausal female 
– A post-menopausal state is defined as no menses for  ≥ 12 months without an 
alternative medical cause other than menopause. A high follicle-stimulating 
hormone (FSH) level in the post-menopausal range may be used to confirm a post-menopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal 
replacement therapy (HRT). However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient.  
– Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use 
one of the non-hormonal highly effective contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow 
confirmation of post-menopausal status before study enrollment.

162/Protocol BP41316, Version 5 2. CONTRACEPTION GUIDAN CE 
Female Participants 
Female participants of childbearing potential are eligible to participate if they agree to 
use highly effective method of contraception consistently and correctly as described in Table 1  below. 
Per ICH M3(R2), highly effective methods of birth control are defined as those, alone or in combination, that result in a low failure rate (i.e., less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly as described in Table 1  below . 
Table 1 Highly Effective Contraceptive Methods 
Highly Effective Contraceptive Methods That Are User -Dependent a 
(Failure rate of < 1% per year when used consistently and correctly)  
• C ombined (estrogen- and progestogen -containing) hormonal contraception associated with 
inhibition of ovulation:  
o Oral 
o Intravaginal  
o Transdermal  
• Progestogen- only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation:  
o Oral 
o Injectable  
Highly Effective Methods That Are User -Independent 
(Failure rate of < 1% per year)  
• Implantable progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of 
ovulationa 
• Intrauterine device (IUD)  
• Intrauterine hormone- releasing system (IUS)  
• Bilateral tubal occlusion/ligation  
Vasectomized partner  
A vasectomized partner is a highly effective contraception method provided that the partner is 
the sole male sexual partner of the WOCBP and the absence of  sperm has been confirmed. If 
not, an additional highly effective method of contraception should be used.  
Sexual abstinence  
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatment. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant.  
  
 
RO7017773 —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
163/Protocol BP41316, Version 5 Acceptable Birth Control Methods Whi ch May Not Be Considered As Highly Effective  
(Failure rate of > 1% per year when used consistently and correctly)  
• Progestogen -only oral hormonal contraception, where inhibition of ovulation is not the  
primary mode of action  
• Male or female condom with or without spermicide b 
• Cap, diaphragm or sponge with spermicide b 
 
a) Hormonal contraception may be susceptible to interaction with the IMP, which may reduce 
the efficacy of the contraception method.  
Typi[INVESTIGATOR_35818]. Use 
should be consistent with local regulations regarding the use of contraceptive methods for participants participating in clinical studies.  
b) A combination of male condom with either cap, diaphragm or sponge with spermicide (double 
barrier methods) are also considered acceptable, but not highly effective, birth control methods. i.e., when the risk of teratogenicity and genotoxicity is unlikely.  
 
Male Participants 
Male contraception is not required in this study because of the minimal seminal dose 
transmitted through sexual intercourse. Indeed, the exposure margins with a vaginal dose of RO7017773 after sexual intercourse (assuming 6 mL volume of semen) are approxim ately [ZIP_CODE] fold (rabbit/human) and 124000-fold (rat/human) based on 
embryo fetal development NOAEL in relevant species (Banholzer et al 2016). 
 
3. PREGNANCY TESTING  
For WOCBP enrolled in the study, blood and urine pregnancy tests will be performed accordi ng to Schedule of Activity tables (see Section 1.3). 
In addition, pregnancy testing will be performed whenever a menstrual cycle is missed or when pregnancy is otherwise suspected and according to local practice. 
4. COLLECTION OF PREGNANCY INFORMATION  
Female participants who become pregnant  
The Investigator will collect pregnancy information on any female participant, who becomes pregnant while participating in this study (see Section 8.3.5 Pregnancy). 
Information will be recorded on the appropriate form and submitted to the Sponsor  within 
24 hours of learning of a participant's pregnancy. The participant will be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. The Investigator will collect follow -up 
information on the participant and the neonate, which will be for warded to the Sponsor. 
Monitoring of the participant should continue until conclusion of the pregnancy. Any 
termination of pregnancy will be reported, regardless of fetal status (presence or absence of anomalies) or indication for procedure. 
 
RO7017773 —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
164/Protocol BP41316, Version [ADDRESS_1185405]-study pregnancy related SAE considered reasonably related to the study treatment by [CONTACT_737], will be reported to the Sponsor  as described in 
Appendix  2. While the Investigator is not obligated to actively seek this information in 
former study participants, he/she may learn of an SAE through spontaneous reporting.  
Any female participant who becomes pregnant while participating in the study will discontinue study treatment and will be withdrawn from the study.  
5 ABORTIONS  
Any spontaneous abortion should be classified as a serious adverse event (as the Sponsor considers spontaneous abortions to be medically significant events), recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5 of Appendix 2 ). 
Any induced abortion due to maternal toxicity and/or embryo -fetal toxicity shoul
 d also be 
classified as serious adverse event, recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5 of Appendix  2).
 
Elective or therapeutic abortion not associated with an underlying maternal or embryofetal toxicity (e.g., induced abortion for personal reasons) does not require expedited reporting but should be reported as outcome of pregnancy on the Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting Form.  
6 CONGENITAL ANOMALIES/BIRTH DEFECT S 
Any congenital anomaly/birth defect in a child born to a female participant should be classified as a serious adverse event, recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event).

PARTICIPATION: BENEFITS, TRAINING, AND COMPLIANCE  
WHAT IS THE BENEFIT OF COLLECTING THESE DA TA? 
The traditional approaches to measuring the signs and symptoms of a condition, through 
the report of a participant, observer, or clinician, have a variety of drawbacks. Reports can be unreliable due to the dependence on subjective ratings. They require the participant to visit a clinical site and this may require travelling a long distance and the time taken to administer the assessments can be great, creating a high burden for the participant. The frequency of measurement is low; therefore, changes in symptom 
severity in-between site visits is not captured. If symptom severity is much higher on the day of the visit, this will give a misleading impression of their status. Digital Health Technology has the potential to address these drawbacks by [CONTACT_852525] a condition objectively, remotely and frequently using sensor technology that can be used independently by [CONTACT_852526]. This study will explore the feasibility of using this technology in this cohort.  
IS A PARTICIPANT OBLIGED TO COMPLETE A TASK IF THEY FIND THE 
DIGITAL BIOMARKER SCHEDULE OF ASSESSMENTS T OO DEMANDING?  
We encourage participants to complete the tasks at home as per the digital biomarker 
schedule of assessments, but if a participant does not complete a task on one or more days this will not count as a protocol deviation. 
IS A PARTICIPANT OBLIGED TO COMPLETE A TASK IF THEY ARE 
UNABLE TO UNDERSTAND THE INSTRUCTIONS?  
The tasks are designed to be simple to understand and full instructions are provided in 
the application. Participants are then provided with full training by [CONTACT_6624]. Some participants may, however, remain unable to understand the task instructions. Understanding instructions may be particularly problematic for those participants with intellectual disability. In such cases site staff can de-a ctivate the task for that participant. 
ARE ALL PARTICIPANTS OBLIGED TO WEAR THE SMARTWATCH?  
When the participant consents to the study, they agree to wear the smartwatch on a daily basis, but if a participant does not wear the smartwatch on one or more day s this 
will not count as a protocol deviation.  
ARE ALL PARTICIPANTS OBLIGED TO INSTALL THE BEACONS?  
The use of the beacons is optional. If the participant agrees to install the beacons in their 
home but subsequently  does not, this will not count as a protocol deviation.

DATA SECURITY AND PRIVACY  
DO YOU CAPTURE ANY PERSONALLY- I DENTIFIABLE INFORMATION?  
The participant’s name [CONTACT_852531]. The site is asked to enter the participant’s screening ID into the smartphone application and all other data captured with the technology is then related to the participant through the screening ID. Please see questions below for issues related to location and audio data. 
HOW IS DATA SECURITY MAINTAINED?  
Once the data have been collected, the data are encrypted using industry gold standard 256-bit asymmetric encryption. This encryption method makes it impossible for anyone, including the study participant, to decrypt and read the data. The data can only be decrypted and processed by [CONTACT_852527]. Whenever the study participant connects to Wi -Fi, the data are transmitted via a secure transfer pr otocol 
(HTTPS) to a secure cloud (Microsoft Azure). 
Data from a participant are uploaded to the Microsoft Azure server located in the 
Netherlands. The Microsoft Azure cloud servers are managed by [CONTACT_1034]. Upon successful data transfer, the data copy on the smartphone is deleted. Data on the 
secure cloud remain asymmetrically encrypted at all times. For data processing and analysis purposes, data are mirrored from the secure cloud to one of the Sponsor’s physical servers that are located behind the Sponsor’s firewall. Here data are decrypted by [CONTACT_852528]. The data are then processed for the computation of features from the sensor data.  
HOW WILL THE AUDIO RECORDINGS BE PROCESSED TO PROTECT THE 
CONFIDENTIALITY OF THE PERSON(S) BEING RECORDED?  
Audio is recorded on the smartphone (only) during the Describe the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_852456]. At the end of each task participants have the option to delete the 
recording. If they agree to transfer the recording, it will be uploaded to the Sponsor via the secure server described above. The audio recordings may then be listened to by a 
small, limited number of researchers employed by [CONTACT_1034]. Features will be derived from the audio recordings for analysis. These features will not include personally -
identifiable information. There will be a delay between the audio recordings being 
recorded, transferred to the Sponsor, and analyzed by [CONTACT_1034], potentially lasting up to many months; therefore, the recordings will not be used for detecting adverse even ts. 
 
RO7017773 —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
176/Protocol BP41316, Version 5 Background noise is also recorded continuously by [CONTACT_336761]. 
Statistical features of these data are extracted by [CONTACT_336761]. The raw audio recordings are not stored on the smartphone – they are held in temporary memory 
and discarded after extraction of the statistical features. The statistical features are then transferred to the Sponsor via the server described above. These statistical features allow one to infer the volume and duration of speech in the environment, but not the 
actual words spoken.  
HOW IS LOCATION DATA PROCESSED TO PROTECT PARTICIPANT 
PRIVACY?  
GPS location data are obfuscated at data capture. From the obfuscated data it is not possible to determine the participant’s actual location, only the direction and distance that they travel. Specifically, the data points are translated into latitudinal and longitudinal direction and also rotated using a certain factor within their natural ranges of -90° : +90° for latitude, - 180° : +180° for longitude and 0° : 360°  for rotation. 
REMOTE ADMINISTRATIO N OF IN -CLINIC ASSESSMENTS FOR DIGITAL 
BIOMARKERS  
In the event that the study participant and support person are not able to access their 
clinical site to attend in-clinic visits as scheduled per Table 3 , in-clinic assessment for the 
digital biomarkers might be administrated remotely in a telemedicine visit (e.g., phone 
call, virtual meeting) set up to best fit patient’s and support person’s needs as well as site capabilities. Remote in-clinic assessments are in any case to be performed under 
the supervision (in– remote) of study site personnel, who should provide support as 
needed to study participant and support person. Within the study phone app, a remote in-clinic assessment feature has been built and it is unattained password protected. This 
function is not hosted in the clinician area, but is specificall y designed to be accessed 
only by [CONTACT_19288]. Detailed guidance will be provided to the study sites for remote administration of the in-clinic assessment for digital biomarkers .  
Remote assessments should be scheduled within the corresponding visit window and 
can only be done if the participants have access to a location where privacy can be assured and distractions kept to a minimum.

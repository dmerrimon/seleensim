1 Objectives 
 
1.1 Hypotheses to be Tested The objective of this phase II study is to demon strate the utility of the radiopharmaceutical, 3′-deoxy- 3′-
18F-
fluorothymidine (18F-FLT), as an imaging agent to assess cellular pr oliferation for the characterization and 
evaluation of central nervous system  tumors in children.  The primary goals of this investigation are to 
evaluate the use of 18F-FLT-PET for grading and staging brain tumors  at diagnosis, for determining if there 
has been tumor recurrence, an d for early assessment of the response to chemotherapy. 18F-FLT tumor uptake 
will be assessed by [CONTACT_28124] (PET) and 18F-FLT-PET findings will be correlated with 
histopathology of tissue obtained from surgical resection/biopsy and wi th patient outcomes.  The proposed 
studies will evaluate 18F-FLT-PET by [CONTACT_497743]: 
1. 18F-FLT uptake is an accurate marker of cellular prol iferation and tumor grade fo r central nervous system 
tumors in children.  This hypothesis will be tested by [CONTACT_255999] 18F-FLT uptake with tumor histology in 
children with newly diagnosed central nervous system tumors who have or will be undergoing surgical 
resection. 
2. 18F-FLT uptake is an accurate marker of cellular prol iferation in children with possible recurrent central 
nervous system tumors, which should help discriminate recurrent tumor from  benign scar or inflammation.  
This hypothesis will be tested in children with a hist ory of treated central nervous system tumor in whom 
standard imaging has raised concern for tumor recu rrence and for whom previously resected tumor is 
available for histological analysis. 
3. Changes in 18F-FLT uptake, as a measure of cellular prolifer ation, will demonstrate cellular response to 
chemotherapy in central nervous system tumors in childr en and will predict clinical outcome.  To test this 
hypothesis, children undergoing chemotherapy for central nervous system tumors will be studied by 18F-
FLT-PET before  chemotherapy and after two cycles of chemotherapy. Absolute 18F-FLT uptake and 
changes in uptake will be correlated with patient outc omes, including disease-free  and overall survival.   
 1.2 Research Plan The primary objective of this stud y is to evaluate the utility of 
18F-FLT as a PET imaging agent to assess 
cellular proliferation for the characterization and evaluati on of central nervous system  tumors in children.   
Specifically, we will evaluate the use of 18F-FLT-PET for grading and staging brain tumors at diagnosis, for 
early assessment of the resp onse to chemotherapy, and for determinin g if there has been tumor recurrence.  
A secondary objective is to bette r define the Biodistribution of 18F-FLT administered to children and 
adolescents. To accomplish the specific aims, th e following clinical studies will be performed: 
 
Study 1: In children with newly diagnosed central nervous system tumors, 18F-FLT-PET will be used to 
assess tumor grade and proliferation: Subjects will be recruited upon presentation to neuro-oncology or 
neurosurgery for medical care of newly di agnosed central nervous system tumors.  18F-FLT-PET of the 
brain and/or spi[INVESTIGATOR_497705] (at least half as asse ssed by [CONTACT_11065]) tumor mass. Tumor samples will 
undergo standard histological analys is for pathological diagnosis, as  well as quantitative assessment 
proliferation as assessed by [CONTACT_497744]-1 proliferation (Ki67) staining. 
Qualitative and quantitative measures of tumor uptake of 18F-FLT will be correlated with histological tumor 
grade and proliferation. 
 
Study 2: In children in whom standard im aging has raised concern for recu rrence of a primary brain tumor, 
18F-FLT-PET will be used to assess cellular proliferation and determine if 18F-FLT-PET findings can 
discriminate tumor from benign tissue. Subjects will be id entified as a result of follow-up studies, such as 
brain MRI, that raise concern fo r possible tumor recurrence. If surgery/biopsy is planned, 18F-FLT-PET of 
the brain and/or spi[INVESTIGATOR_497706](s) of concern. Tumor samples 
from current biopsy/resection or if unavailable, tissue from a previous resection/biopsy must be available 
for histological analysis.   As in study 1, surgical specimens will undergo standard histological analysis for pathological diagnosis, assessment of mitotic inde x for tumor grade, and MIB-1 proliferat ion (Ki67) 
staining.  Qualitative and quantitative measures of lesion uptake of 
18F-FLT will be correlated with 
proliferative measures and with th e final pathological diagnosis.

Study 3:  In children with primary ce ntral nervous system tumors, 18F-FLT-PET will be used to assess the 
response to chemotherapy and to eval uate if a given PET response predicts clinical outcome.  This study 
will be limited to children with neuroeopi[INVESTIGATOR_497707] a new regimen of chemother apy or biologically-based therapy.  18F-FLT-PET will be 
performed before initiation of therapy and again af ter completion of two courses of chemotherapy or 
approximately 40-70 days after start of therapy.  Partic ipants will not be enrolled if they are expected to 
receive concurrent radiation therapy.  No tumor specimens need be availa ble for correlation with 18F-FLT-
PET findings, but histological analysis can be performed if tumor is available from a prior resection/biopsy.  
Absolute and changes in qualitative and quan titative measures of tumor uptake of 18F-FLT will be used to 
assess changes in tumor proliferation in response to  chemotherapy.  These findings will be compared to 
other routine imaging studies such as MRI, and will be evaluated as an early predictor of clinical outcomes 
including duration of disease-free survival and overall survival. 
 
Study 4: Biodistribution Study:  In some participants al ready enrolled in one of the above studies, whole 
body PET will be performed to assess the biodistribution of 18F-FLT.  This study will be performed only in a 
subset of participants undergoing FLT-PET of the brain for Study 1, Study 2, or Study 3.   Participants will 
undergo whole body PET at three time points: i mmediately after 18F-FLT administration, immediately after 
brain imaging, and again 2-5 hours after tracer admi nistration. See Section 5. 1.5 for the anticipated 
additional time required to complete these extra sequences.  
 
1.3 Investigational Drug Status 
18F-FLT is an investigational drug.  It is used unde r IND 104365 issued to the sponsor-investigator 
Frederick D. Grant, M.D. at [LOCATION_011] Children’s Hospit al, which references IND [ADDRESS_640145] common solid tumor in 
children, and are the leading cause of death from solid tumors in children. In the [LOCATION_002], 20,500 new 
malignant tumors of the central nervous system were diagnosed in 2007, and of these, approximately 2,200 
were diagnosed in children < 20 years.     In 2007, the prevalence of ma lignant brain tumors in children was 
approximately 21,000 in the [LOCATION_002].[1]  A wide variety of tumors may occur in the central ne rvous system, and prognosis is related to tumor type, 
histological grade, and location.  In adults, a large portion of malignant central nervous system lesions may 
represent metastases of extra-crania l tumors, but this is less common in  children.  Although some pediatric 
central nervous system tumors may represent lesions wi thout a primary brain origin, such as lymphomas and 
leukemia, most malignant pediatric central nervous system  tumors have a neuroepi[INVESTIGATOR_497708].[1] Histological grading is a means of predicting biological behavior, and for most 
neuroepi[INVESTIGATOR_497709], is pr edictive of patient outcome. The World Health Organization (WHO) 
classification of tumors provides a grading scale across the range of central nervous system tumors and is the 
accepted standard scheme by [CONTACT_497745].  The WHO classification is based a four point 
scale [1-4] with grade 1 indicating a low proliferative potential and grad e 4 signifying mitotically active, 
malignant tumors with the likelihood of rapid progressi on and death.  Low-grade tu mors (grades 1 and 2) are 
more likely to respond to therapy an d may have an indolent course. High grade tumors (grades 3 and 4) are 
biologically aggressive and have shorter overall surviv al.[2] More recently, more quantitative methods of 
assessing tumor proliferation have been used.  The Ki67 tumor proliferation index is assessed by [CONTACT_497746]-[ADDRESS_640146] shown that an increased Ki67 index 
is correlated with higher WHO tumor grade and pred icts a poorer prognosis.[3 , 4]  More recently, 
immunohistological quantification of mitosis has been used to produce a quantitative mitotic index, which also 
correlates with tumor grade.[5]

[ADDRESS_640147] a poor  prognosis. One of the challenges is  assessing response to therapy, and 
in particular the rapid identification  of treatment failure.  Although tumor progression and growth may be 
clearly identified, a poor resp onse to therapy may not be  identified for many months with anatomic imaging 
modalities, including MRI.  Without identification of non- effective or poorly effective therapy, there is limited 
opportunity to modify the tr eatment plan to a potentiall y more effective therapy. 
   
2.2 Positron Emission Tomography Positron emission tomography (PET) utilizes radioactiv e tracers to selectively measure metabolic pathways of 
interest and thus provides an imaging tool that effect ively measures metabolic or proliferative activity in a 
tumor.   Fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (
18F-FDG) has become the most wide ly used PET imaging agent, and 
has found particular utility in oncology as it provides images of physiologic function.[6] FDG is an analogue of 
glucose, and its cellular retention is a function of  glucose metabolism governed by [CONTACT_497747].[7]   18F-FDG 
uptake in tumor cells therefore is a re liable indicator of metabolic activity and has proven useful for evaluating 
many types of malignancies.  For example, it is useful in determining the loco-regional extent as well as the 
presence of distant metastases in cancers of lungs, colon, ovaries, head and neck, breast and pancreatic 
cancer.  The accuracy of 18F-FDG in determining local extent of the disease, lymph node involvement, distant 
metastases, and post-therapy recurren t/residual tumors has also been es tablished.[6] Other studies have 
shown that 18F-FDG uptake often declines after successful tr eatment. [8-10] Thus, during the course of 
therapy, PET can be a powerful method to assess changes in tumors over relatively  short periods of time; 
while other imaging modalities are not as effective in  assessing the success or failure of a therapy because 
changes in tumor size and contrast en hancement may not occur for several weeks or months into treatment.  
 
18F-FDG-PET, however, has proven less useful in imagin g brain tumors.[11-13]  An  important limitation of 18F-
FDG-PET specific to brain tumors is the high level of glucose utilization in the normal brain.  The high uptake 
of 18F-FDG by [CONTACT_497748]-level uptake. [12,  13] Another limit ation is that 18F-FDG is not a selective tracer for tumors.  As an 
indicator of glucose uptake, many cell types other than malignant cells can ut ilize high levels of glucose.  For 
example, macrophages are characterized by [CONTACT_497749] 18F-FDG and thus inflammatory lesions can 
demonstrate increased 18F-FDG uptake.[14, 15]  Limitations of 18F-FDG-PET are particularly problematic in the 
evaluation of recurrent brain tumors.  In patients with prior surgical  or radiation therapy, inflammatory changes 
and evolving scar tissue may be indistinguishable from recurrent tumor.  In a patient with a new or subtle 
finding on MRI, repeat neurosurgical bi opsy may be required to  determine if the change s represent benign or 
recurrent malignant disease. 18F-FDG-PET can sometimes be helpful in this clinical situation, but sensitivity 
remains limited by [CONTACT_497750].  These limitations of 
18F-FDG as a cancer imaging agent have led to  an investigation of PET tracers that may 
be more specific for cellular proliferation.  For exampl e, labeled thymidine has been used in cell culture and 
animal studies for years since it is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_497710].  Pyrimidine analogues 
mimic physiological nucleosi des in terms of cellular uptake and metabolism through the salvage pathway 
comprising thymidine kinase-1 (TK-1) and deoxycytid ine kinase (dCK).[16] dC K is a key enzyme as it 
catalyzes the phosphorylation of deoxycytidine and comparable analogues, whic h leads to intracellular 
trappi[INVESTIGATOR_497711].[16] Cytosolic TK-1 catalyze s the phosphorylation of various pyrimidine analogues 
to the corresponding monophosphate, resu lting in the intracellular trappi[INVESTIGATOR_497712].  TK-1 activity is 
very low in G 1 cells, increases at the G 1/early S boundary, and reaches ma ximum values in late S phase/G 2. 
High levels of TK-[ADDRESS_640148] cancer.[17]  
Studies have also demonstrated that TK activity increases about 10-fold as cells enter the DNA synthetic 
phase.[17, 18]  2.3 3′-deoxy- 3′-18F-fluorothymidine (18F-FLT) 
Although initial studies of radiolabeled thymidine analogs for PET imaging focused on 
11C-labeled thymidine, 
[19, 20] this agent is not widely used  because it is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_78081], which confounds interpretation of the 
[18F] FLT PET of Pediatric Brain Tumors        
1June2009, amended 27Febr2012 Revised 18Sept2012, 28Feb2 013, 8Feb2016, 1Feb2019 
 
 
7 images; moreover, the short half-life of 11C (20 min.) restricts its use to those centers with on-site cyclotrons. 
As a result, attention has been di rected primarily to a pyrimidine an alog that could be labeled with 18F (t 1/2 = 
110 min.) and is resistant to in vivo degradation.[21, 22]  Research ha s focused on imaging DNA synthesis 
with FLT (3'-deoxy-3'-fluorothymidine), an antiviral compound that has been tested in su bjects with HIV. [23] 
18F-FLT is taken up by [CONTACT_497751] 1 (TK), but is not incorporated into DNA, 
which leads to intracellular trappi[INVESTIGATOR_497713].[24] Thus, retention of 18F-FLT within the cell indicates 
cellular TK activity, a measure of cellular proliferation.    
 
18F-FLT-PET can reveal early and specific changes af ter treatment of human esophageal squamous cell 
carcinoma.[25] In canine and human subjects with non-small cell lung cancer, FLT is retained in proliferating 
tissues by [CONTACT_497752]-contrast images of normal marrow and tumors.[26]  Vesselle, et 
al. evaluated 18F-FLT-PET for noninvasive assessment of prolifer ation rates of biopsy-proven, non-small cell 
lung cancer in 10 subjects.[ 27] They demonstrated that 18F-FLT-PET may have a useful  role in the evaluation 
of indeterminate pulmonary lesions; in  the prognostic assessment of resectab le, non-small cell cancer of lung; 
and possibly in the evalua tion of tumor response to chemotherapy.  Buck et al.  evaluated 18F-FLT-PET in thirty 
subjects with solitary pulmonary nodules.[28] With use of standard ized uptake values (SUVs) of 18F-FLT 
uptake, uptake appeared specific for malignant lesions an d may be used for differential diagnosis of solitary 
pulmonary nodules, assessment of proliferatio n, and estimation of  prognosis.  Thus, in vivo and in vitro  studies 
have shown that FLT-PET can be an accurate method for evaluating malignant disease and for differentiating 
benign from malignant tissues. 
 
18F-FLT has been a par ticularly attractive agent for imaging brain tu mors because its background activity in the 
brain is much lower than is seen with 18F-FDG.[29] Spence, et al. [30] used dynamic PET  and mathematical 
modeling to estimate transport and retention of 18F-FLT in four glioma patients and observed that, after 
therapy, 18F-FLT transport decreased, sugges ting an observable decrease in  cellular proliferation after 
therapy.  This occurred despi[INVESTIGATOR_497714] e in the volume of the 3-D region of 18F-FLT uptake, suggesting that 
the decreased uptake did not reflect only tumor shrinkage.  Choi, et al [31] compared 18F-FLT and 18F-FDG for 
PET imaging of brain tumors in 22 pa tients. In 18 of these patients with isometabolic or hypometabolic lesions 
on FDG PET, the sensitivity and specificity of FLT- PET was 83% and 83%, respectively.  This study also 
demonstrated a significant difference between the lesion-t o-normal tissue ratios in hi gh (5.7±2.2, n=7) and low 
(2.3±1.1, n=5) grade gliomas (p<0.05).  Thus, FLT-PET was of value in making the differential diagnosis of 
brain tumors that were not evident on  FDG-PET.  In a similar study, Kim, et al [32] compared FLT-PET and 
FDG-PET in 16 patients with brain tu mors.  Overall, FLT stud ies were positive in 22  of 26 lesions (85%) 
compared to 15 or 26 (58%) with FDG, despi[INVESTIGATOR_497715].   They also obser ved higher uptake of FLT in high -grade (6.07±0.76) versus low-grade 
(3.11±2.15) gliomas (p=0.002), while no signif icant difference was observed with FDG.  Chen, et al [33]] also 
reported that FLT was more sensitive than FDG for evaluating re current tumors and that it correlated with the 
Ki-[ADDRESS_640149] suggested that  FLT-PET may be more sensitive than FDG-PET in 
identifying malignant lesions; may provide more accu rate information regarding tumor grade; and may be 
more useful in imaging evaluation of  recurrent tumors.  Very few children  with central nervous system tumors, 
however, have been included in publ ished studies; nor have any studies assessed the potential effects of age 
and smaller size on FLT biodistribut ion.  In a clinical study, Choi et al [31]included 8 subjec ts ages 8-13 years, 
but in none of these subjects was a hi stopathological measure of proliferation (e.g., the Ki-67 index) reported.  
Finally, there has been no reported use of FLT-PET to assess pediatric pa tients with possi ble recurrence of 
central nervous system tumors.  2.[ADDRESS_640150], therefore, are to assess the utility of 
FLT-PET in three clinical situations : 1) staging and grading brain tumors  at diagnosis; 2) assessing tumor 
[18F] FLT PET of Pediatric Brain Tumors        
1June2009, amended 27Febr2012 Revised 18Sept2012, 28Feb2 013, 8Feb2016, 1Feb2019 
 
 
8 recurrence; and 3) evaluating  response to chemotherapy early in the course of therapy, which may help guide 
treatment planning.  These proposed studies aim to validate the utility of 18F-FLT-PET to assess cellular 
proliferation, tumor grade, and respon se to therapy in pediatric brain tumo rs.  These findings should support 
efforts to transition 18F-FLT from experimental drug status to that  of a disease-specific PET imaging agent in 
routine clinical use for evaluating central nervous sy stem tumors in children.  An adequate supply of 18F-FLT 
will be provided by [CONTACT_497753], a subsidia ry of Siemens Medical Imaging.   
 
3 Patient Selection and Eligibility: 
 
3.1 Clinical Setting:   The defined clinical setting comprises pediatric patients with the diagnosis of central nervous system tumor.  
 3.[ADDRESS_640151] Identification:  Subjects will be identified at the time of presentation for medical care for a central nervous system tumor. The diagnosis of central nervous system tumor will be made on the basis of clinical and radiological findings.  
Individuals with metastatic disease or  recurrence within the central nervous system (e.g. seeding to the spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) 
are eligible, but individuals with extra-axial tumors or CNS metastases from non-CNS tumors are not eligible.  
 
All patients meeting the eligibility and exclusion criteria will be offered the opportunity for enrollment.  Subjects 
will be only imaged as part of this study and there is no expected intervention effect.  All identified patients 
meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria will be offered an opportunity to participate in this study. As the 
proposed research is not a tr eatment study, no randomizat ion of subjects is required , and all pati ents entered 
into the study will undergo the same imaging studies. No control group will be enrolled.    3.[ADDRESS_640152] Enrollment: Subjects may be enrolled at on e of three time points in the clinical course of disease: 
3.3.1 Study 1 (New Diagnosis):
  
Pediatric patients with newly diag nosed primary central nervous system tumors undergoing surgical 
resection/biopsy within [ADDRESS_640153] undergo ne resection/biopsy with 
substantial residual (greater than half as assessed by [CONTACT_11065]) tumor. 3.3.2 Study 2 (Possible Tumor Recurrence):  Pediatric patients with a hi story of treated primary central nervous sy stem tumor, in whom standard imaging 
has raised concern for tumor recurrence. Tumor tissue fo r histological analysis must be available from a 
biopsy/resection planned within  the next [ADDRESS_640154] ion/biopsy if no current biopsy material 
is available. 3.3.3 Study 3 (Response to Therapy):  Pediatric patients with a primary central nervous system tumor who will be starting a new regimen (standard or experimental) of chemotherapy within 21 daysand who w ill not be receiving concurrent radiation therapy. 
 3.4 Enrollment in Multiple Parts of this Study:  Subjects enrolled in any of the studies (3.3.1, 3.3.2, or  3.3.3) are eligible for concurrent enrollment in the 
Biodistribution Study.    Determination of whether a participant is asked to do the whole body study depends 
on patient availability, PET camera availability, travel time after the study, medical stability, ability of the patient 
to cooperate, etc.  It is up to the physician getting co nsent to decide whether to ask the family to consider 
participation in the bio- distribution study.   
 
Subjects enrolled with a new diagnosis (3.3.1) will be elig ible for imaging at subsequent time points (3.3.2 and

Information will be provided to pot ential subjects and their parents/guardians (as appropriate) by [CONTACT_497754].  
Subjects less than 18 years of age capable of giving  assent will be included  in these discussions and 
will be asked for written assent on the same document as the parents/guardians give consent. If 
feasible, both parents (or guardians) will be included  in these discussions and will be asked to sign the 
written consent document.  If a second parent or gu ardian is unavailable, this will be explained in 
writing on the written consent document.  If subjec ts age 18 years or older are unable to provide 
informed consent, then they will not be enrolled in this study.

 3.7 Inclusion of Women and Minorities: Gender and/or minority status will not be used as selectio n criteria for enrollment in the study. As the proposed 
research is not a trea tment study, no randomization of subjects is  required, and all pati ents entered into the 
study will undergo the same imaging studies. There is no evidence in the literature that the relationship 
between FLT avidity and tumor proliferation is  altered by [CONTACT_497755]. 
 
The reported gender-based prevalence of malignant pe diatric brain tumors is 1. 4 times more common in 
males than females. [1] Therefore, we anticipate that subject recruitment will reflect this risk resulting in 
accrual of more males than females. The minority-based  prevalence of malignant brain tumors is 1.3 times 
more common in whites than in minority populations.[1 ]   Similarly we anticipate subject recruitment that will 
reflect a patient population adjusted for the increased risk of malignant pediatri c brain tumors in the non-
minority population.   The maximum sample size for this trial is 75 patients with  the likelihood that it will be smaller since patients are 
allowed to enroll in multiple studies. The table below re flects the anticipated enrollment figures by [CONTACT_49870]/ethnicity:

4.7.3 Qualitative and quantitative measures of lesion uptake of 18F-FLT will be correlated with proliferative 
measures. Correlation also will be made with the fina l pathological determination of recurrent tumor or 
benign tissue. 
 4.8 Study 3 In children with neuroepi[INVESTIGATOR_497724], use 
18F-FLT-PET to assess the response to 
chemotherapy and evaluate if this response predicts clinical outcome. This study will be performed in children 
receiving a new regimen of chemotherapy or biologic-bas ed therapy for treatment of  a central nervous system 
tumor.  Children who are expected to receive c oncurrent radiation therapy will not be enrolled. 
4.8.1 Patients will undergo 18F-FLT-PET of the brain and/or spin al column at two time points: 
[IP_ADDRESS] Prior to initiation of ch emotherapy, if pa tients un derwent 18F-FLT-PET imaging prior to 
surgical biopsy, the pre-chemotherapy 18F-FLT-PET still will be repeated to take into 
account changes in tumor architec ture or proliferation that ma y have occurred in response 
to neurosurgical intervention. 
[IP_ADDRESS] The second 18F-FLT-PET will be performed after completion of the second course of 
chemotherapy (typi[INVESTIGATOR_497725] - 40-70 days- after start of chemotherapy),but 
before the third course of ch emotherapy, before any addition al surgery, and before any 
radiotherapy. 
 4.8.2 Qualitative and quantitative measures of tumor uptake of 
18F-FLT will be determined and used to 
assess tumor proliferation measures after chemotherapy.  Tumor proliferation after chemotherapy will be assessed as an early predictor of clinical outcomes including durati on of disease-free survival and 
duration of survival. 
4.8.3 Subjects enrolled in Study 2 may be enrolled in the Study 3 only if th ere is sufficient residual tumor for 
imaging.

[ADDRESS_640163] been met. This includes: 
[IP_ADDRESS].  The FLT-PET has been perf ormed and is technically adequate for analysis.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Pathologic evaluation conf irms the diagnosis of a brai n tumor.  For example, a 
participant may be enrolled appropriately in Study 1 prior to surgery, and if the final 
pathologic diagnosis does  not demonstrate a neuroectodermal brain tumor (e.g. 
lymphoma or infection), then that participant will not be considered evaluable. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Histological analysis, including Ki67 (MIB ) evaluation, is completed and technically 
adequate for analysis.   
[IP_ADDRESS].  Long-term follow-up and survival data  collection have been completed. 
 
4.10 Study Completion 
4.10.1.  Study Intervention and Active Follow-up:  As part  of the Safety Monitoring Plan, blood tests will 
be performed within one week after the FLT-PET scan. Once these post- scan blood test results 
are obtained, a participant will be deemed to hav e ended study intervention and active follow-
up. 
4.10.2  Long-Term Follow-up and Survival: Long-term foll ow-up and survival data collection will be 
performed for two years (or until death) afte r the last FLT-PET scan, at which time the 
participant will be deemed to have completed all study requirements and will become an 
Inactive Study Participant. 
4.10.3.  Inactive (Off-Study): A participant will be deem ed to be an Inactive Study Participant (Off-
Study) for any of the following reasons: 
 [IP_ADDRESS].  Participant death before completion of active follow-up. 
 [IP_ADDRESS].  Participant (or parent/guard ian) has withdrawn consent 
 [IP_ADDRESS].  Participant is found to be ineligible after being enrolled in the study.. 
 [IP_ADDRESS].  Participant is determined to be not evalua ble (section 4.9) or lost to follow-up 
 [IP_ADDRESS].  Participant has completed all study requirements 
 4.9 PET Imaging Protocols:  Subjects will undergo PET imaging with 
18F-FLT.  For each study, all PET imaging will be performed after 
administration of a single dose of 18F-FLT.  Participants must be able to cooperate with required imaging 
without anesthesia or sedation.  4.10 Image Acquisition 
4.10.1 Patient Preparation:  No special patient preparation is required .  Patients do not need to be fasting 
(unlike 
18F-FDG) and can receive intravenous fluids as indicated by [CONTACT_497759].  
4.10.2  18F-FLT Dose : Based on prior literature an d radiation dosimetry calculations (Section 8), an 18F-FLT 
dose of 0.15 mCi/kg, with a maximum dose of 10 mCi, will be used for all studies. This is similar to the 
dose used for FDG-PET imaging in pediatric pati ents.  Based on the specific activity of 18F-FLT   (>200 
Ci/mmol ), the mass of 18F-FLT administered will be approximately 180 nanogram /kg (maximum 12 
microgram). 
4.10.3 18F-FLT Administration:   The 18F-FLT is administered through an intravenous catheter as per 
standard PET procedures.   
4.10.4 Brain PET Acquisition:  In all subjects, at [ADDRESS_640164]-administration,  a brain and/or spi[INVESTIGATOR_497726] 3-D mode with a 5-10 min emission scan at each bed position, including all 
areas of suspected tumor (brain, spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], or brain and spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]).  For attenuation correction, a low-dose CT 
will be acquired of the imaged region, per standard PET/CT procedures.  
4.10.5 Biodistribution PET Acquisition (12 subjects):   In the twelve subjects un dergoing the biodistribtution 
study, PET of the head and torso (field of view extending from top of head to the mid-thighs) will be 
performed at three time poi nts: (1) immediately after 18F-FLT administration, (2 ) at approximately one 
hour after 18F-FLT administration, after completion of the brain PET, and (3) at 2-[ADDRESS_640165] PET/CT procedures.

4.10.6 PET Processing : All PET scans are reconstructed using an OSEM algorithm with CT-based 
attenuation correction.  
4.10.7 MRI for Correlation:   An MRI of the involved regions (brain  and/or spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) is required for image co-
registration and anatomic correlation.  These should be the most recent MRI studies of the involved 
regions that were performed with and without gadolini um contrast.  An additi onal brain or spi[INVESTIGATOR_497727].  
4.10.8 Image submission:   FLT-PET and recent MRI will be submitted through the PBTC for central review.  
The reconstructed PET data and correlative MRI scans should be submitted in standard DICOM 
format.   
 
4.11 Data Processing (Central Review) 
4.11.1 Co-registration with MRI:  Brain and/or spi[INVESTIGATOR_497728]-registered to the most recent 
previously acquired MRI using visual analysis, which may be assisted by [CONTACT_497760] (Seimens Fusion 3D or Hermes Medical Solutions). 
4.11.2 Image Analysis:  Assessment of FLT uptake will be performed independently by [CONTACT_497761].   
All central reviews will be performed in the Neuroimaging center (NIC) of the PBTC.  
4.11.3 Blinding:  Analysis will be performed in a masked (blind ed) manner with the evaluator unaware of the 
results of other imaging stud ies, histopathological studie s, or patient outcome.  
4.11.4 Tumor Delineation:  3D regions of interest will be drawn arou nd the tumor.  In addition, an analogous 
ROI will be drawn in normal brain background an d about the whole brain for comparison.   
4.11.5 Quantitative Assessment : On each brain PET sca n, tumor uptake of 18F-FLT will be assessed in two 
ways:  
[IP_ADDRESS] Abnormal uptake graded on a 4- point scale of uniformity of uptake 
[IP_ADDRESS] Determination of standard uptake values (SUV’s) fo r which tumor, tumor-to-background, 
and tumor-to- whole brain ratios will be determined using maximal and mean SUV’s.  
4.11.6 Biodistribution:  In those studies including torso imaging, FLT biodistribution will be assessed by [CONTACT_31576]-
quantitative region-of-interest analysis of sites with substantial tracer uptake.

Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imag ing (SNMMI) and the American Associat ion of Physicists in Medicine 
(AAPM).  These findings were published as a peer-reviewe d article.[34] In the future, the Neuroimaging Center 
of the PBTC may design other quality assurance initiative that will deploy a different PET phantom for 
evaluation at each site. It is anticipated that all sites will participate in this quality control initiative. 
 
5 Safety Considerations 
5.1 Radioactive Safety 
18F-FDG-PET has been used safely in adult human subjects  and has been shown to be  effective in both in 
vivo and in vitro studies as discussed in  the Background.  In this study, subjects will receive 18F-FLT at an 
intravenous dose of 0.15 mCi/kg.  This will give an effective dose (i.e. whole body) of 5.6 to 8.8 mSv 
depending upon body size.  The normal liver and bone marrow show relatively homogenous uptake of 18F-
FLT and it undergoes renal ex cretion.  The calculated effective radi ation dose (whole body) and the dose to 
the critical organ (bladder) are simila r to that associated with FDG-PET (b elow).  FLT dosimetry is calculated 
using OLINDA software (Vanderbilt University) [35] and residence times from Ve sselle et al. [36]  FDG 
dosimetry is calculated from ICRP Report 80. [37]

 5.2 Pharmacological Safety 
In vitro:   During  in vitro studies of non-radioactive FLT, chromosomal abnormalities were seen when cells were 
cultured with very high doses of FLT for more than [ADDRESS_640169] level that caused chromosome damage in in vitro laboratory tests.  
However, similar studies hav e not been performed with 18F-FLT.  
 
In vivo: Non-radioactive FLT (also called MI V 310 or alovudine) has completed phase II clinical trial in patients 
with HIV.  FLT was given to a total of 140 HIV-infected patients in 6 well-documented  clinical studies.  The 
patients were treated with FLT as the only antiviral treatment for up to 16 we eks.  At daily dose of 7.5 mg for 4 
weeks, FLT was generally well tolerated and did not result in any seriou s events. [38]   For this study, 18F-FLT 
dose will be adjusted based on patient weight. Prior huma n studies in adults with FLT-PET have not shown any 
adverse effects at doses similar to that proposed for this study (0.15 mCi/kg). Based on the specific activity of 
18F-FLT (>200 Ci/mmol), the mass of 18F-FLT administered (180 nanogr am/kg) for PET imaging is  
[18F] FLT PET of Pediatric Brain Tumors

[ADDRESS_640170] 
(approximately 0.1 mg/kg).  Thus, negligible phar macological effect or risk is anticipated. 
 
6 Drug Formulation 
The radiopharmaceutical, 3′-deoxy- 3′-18F-fluorothymidine (18F-FLT) will be used for all imaging studies. The 
attached IND application includes c hemistry, manufacturing, and control data.  The compound has a physical 
half-life of [ADDRESS_640171] operating 
procedure using a dose calibrator. FLT will be administered intravenously at a dose of 0.15 mCi/kg, with a 
maximum dose of 10 mCi as described in the PET Imaging Protocol (section 4.9). 
 
7 Correlative Clinical Data  
7.1 Tissue for histopathology 
Subjects will undergo surgery (biopsy or gross total resection) as indicated for usual clinical care. 
7.1.1 Tissue specimens will be processed and analyzed in the local pathology department per usual routine. 
7.1.2 Tumor samples will be analyzed for MIB-1 prolif eration by [CONTACT_15915]67staining.  Ki-67 staining may be 
performed at the local institution if Ki-67 staining is clinically indicated.  Stained (1) or unstained (2-4) 
slides appropriate for quantitative MIB-1 evaluation as well as the associated local pathology report will 
be sent to [LOCATION_011] Children’s  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_497729].  PBTC sites, please add Briana Sexton-

 11.2  Safety Monitoring Plan This Safety Monitoring Plan has been  designed with the advice and appr oval of the FDA and is designed to 
monitor for both immediate and delayed adverse events. 
11.2.1  Immediate: 
Surveillance for immediate unexpected adverse even ts will include monitoring vital signs before, 
during, and after FLT administration.  A focused ph ysical examination will be performed before FLT 
administration and after completion of imaging.   
11.2.2  Delayed: 
Monitoring for delayed unexpected adverse events will utilize (1) laboratory testing within one week of 
18F-FLT administration and (2) surveillance by [CONTACT_497767]/treating neuroonc ologist throughout the 
course of each subject’s disease.  
 
11.2.3  Laboratory Surveillance  
For comparison, subjects will be required to hav e baseline laboratory assessment within two weeks 
prior to 18F-FLT administration followed by  [CONTACT_497762], but within one week after 18F-FLT administration.  Thes e laboratory tests may be 
obtained as part of routine clinical care of these patients, but when results ar e not available, the tests 
will be requested as part of this protocol.   Laboratory assessment before and after 
18F-FLT administration will include the following tests: 
[IP_ADDRESS] Serum electrolytes: sodium (Na), po tassium (K), bicarbonate, and chloride(Cl) 
[IP_ADDRESS] Tests of renal func tion: blood urea ni trogen (BUN), serum creatinine (Cr) 
[IP_ADDRESS] Tests of liver function (bilir ubin, ALT, AST, and alkaline phosphatase

Each of these three studies is a diagnost ic imaging study to assess the utility of 18F-FLT in the evaluation of 
pediatric brain tumors.  The study de sign is not studying a therapeutic effect, and no control subjects are 
included.  Several statistical approaches will be utilized for assessing the diagnostic performance of 18F-FLT-
PET.

21 13.1  Study 1:   
Children with newly diagnosed central nervous system tumors, assess the utility of 18F-FLT-PET to assess 
tumor grade and proliferation:  
18F-FLT-PET of the brain and/or spi[INVESTIGATOR_497737] r to surgical excision of the tumor. Tumor samples 
will undergo standard histological an alysis for pathological diagnosis, qualitative assessment of tumor grade 
(WHO tumor grade I-IV), mitotic inde x for quantitative assessment of tu mor grade, and MIB-1 proliferation 
(Ki67) staining. 
 Quantitative measures of tumor uptake of 
18F-FLT will be compared between patients with different tumor 
grade using Wilcoxon rank-sum test, and will be corr elated with proliferation (Ki67 staining) using the 
Spearman rank order correlation coefficient (rho).   In addition, patients will be divided into subgroups based 
on the presence or absence of 18F-FLT uptake; these subgroups will then be compared in terms of Ki67 
proliferation with the nonparametric Wilcoxon rank-s um test. Based on prior liter ature, which suggests a 
moderate positive correlation of 0.70 between 18F-FLT uptake and tumor grade among similar tumor types, 
sample size calculations indicate that 15 evaluable subjects will be  sufficient to attain 85% power ( E=0.15, 2-
tailed D=0.05) to demonstrate a significant correlation of this magnitude.  
 13.2  Study 2:  Children in whom standard imaging has raised concern for recurrence of a central nervous system tumor, use 
18F-FLT to assess cellular prolif eration and determine whether 18F-FLT-PET can discriminate recurrent tumor 
from benign tissue:   
18F-FLT-PET of the brain and/or spi[INVESTIGATOR_497737] r to surgical excision/biopsy of the tumor.  Tumor 
samples from current biopsy/resection whenever po ssible or if unavailable, tissue from a previous 
surgery/biopsy, will undergo standard histological analys is for pathological diagnosis, qualitative assessment 
of tumor grade (WHO tumor grade I-IV ), quantitative assessment of mitoti c index for tumor grade, and MIB-1 
proliferation (Ki67) staining. 
 
Median uptake will be compared between those subjects  with and without recurrence using the nonparametric 
two-sample Wilcoxon rank sum test with  a two-tailed significance  level of 0.05. Assuming that there is an 80% 
likelihood that uptake in non-tumor lesions will be lower than uptake in tumor lesions, power analysis indicated 
that 30 evaluable subjects wo uld provide 80% power to detect a difference of 30% in each 18F-FLT-PET 
parameter between subjects with and without recurrence assuming that ~50% of subjects will have developed 
recurrence. In this study the proposed 30 subjects al so will allow capture of a significant Spearman rho 
correlation as low as rho=0.50 between 18F-FLT and Ki67 index with 85% statistical power.  
 
Logistic regression analysis will be performed to determine the ability of 18F-FLT-PET for predicting tumor 
recurrence as a binary endpoint using each 18F-FLT imaging parameter by [CONTACT_497774].[39] Odds ratios 
and 95% confidence intervals (CI) will be computed as measures of diagnostic performance of 18F-FLT lesion 
uptake with biopsy findings as the gold standard. Re ceiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis will 
be applied to assess area under the curve (A z) as determined by [CONTACT_497775] 18F-FLT parameters determined by [CONTACT_497776].[40]  Sensitivity and specificity with 
95% confidence intervals will be calculated based on chosen cutoffs for each 18F-FLT parameter. We 
anticipate enrolling ~[ADDRESS_640188] that the tumor recurrence rate will be approximately 50% 
at final assessment. 
 13.3  Study 3:  Children with recently diagnosed neuroepi[INVESTIGATOR_497738], use 
18F-FLT-PET to 
characterize the tumor response to chemotherapy and evaluate if earl y tumor response to chemotherapy 
predicts clinical outcome.   This exploratory study will assess different 
18F-FLT parameters for characteri zing tumor response as a 
predictor of clinical outcome.   
 
Subjects will undergo 18F-FLT-PET of the brain and/or spi[INVESTIGATOR_497739]  2 time points: prior to initiation of new 
chemotherapy and after completion of the second cycle of chemotherapy (t ypi[INVESTIGATOR_897] <2 months after start of 
chemotherapy).  A subject will be categorized as a chemotherapy responder if the post-therapy scan shows 
[18F] FLT PET of Pediatric Brain Tumors        
1June2009, amended 27Febr2012 Revised 18Sept2012, 28Feb2 013, 8Feb2016, 1Feb2019 
 
 
22 that tumor uptake has decreased to  less than 75% of the uptake leve l seen on the pre-therapy scan.  A 
subject will be categorized as a non-responder if the post-therapy uptake remains greater than 75% of pre-
therapy uptake.   Survival curves for these two groups (responders and non-responders) will be compared 
using the log-rank test, [41, 42] with an outcome event defined as progression or death during two years of 
clinical follow-up after the start of chemotherapy. In a group of children and young adults with heterogeneous 
tumor types, we estimate an even t rate of 90% in non-responders and an event rate of 40% in FLT 
responders.  Statistical analysis will be performed using SPSS software (version  17.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, 
IL). Two-tailed p < 0.05 will be considered statistically significant.  
 Power calculations were performed using nQuery Advisor (version 7.0, Statistical Solutions, Saugus, MA), 
assuming that progression-free survival will be obse rved in 10% of non-responde rs and 60% of responders, 
with a hazard ratio of 4.508.  To have an 80% chance of detecting a significant (p ≤ 0.05) difference in the rate 
of progression-free response between th ese two groups, a sample size of 15 per group, or total enrollment of 
30 will be needed.  A minimum of 14 events (progressi on or death) will be required to detect a difference 
between the two groups.[43]

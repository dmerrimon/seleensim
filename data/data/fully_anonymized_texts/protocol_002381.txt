Page 106.RATIONALE AND BACKGRO UND
Tofacitinib 5 mg immediate release for mulation (IR) was approved for a twice dail y (BID) 
dosing schedule by [CONTACT_309819] n (FDA) in November [ADDRESS_517083] 
hadan inadequate response or intolerance to methotrexate .In February , 2016, an 11 mg 
once a day  (QD) modified release tablet (X R) for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis was 
approved in the [LOCATION_002].  It may  be used as monotherapy  or in c ombination with
methotrexate (MTX) or othe r conventional s ynthetic disease -modify ing antirheumatic drugs 
(csDMARD s
). Since approval, little i s known about the effect of tofacitinib on patie nt 
outcomes relative to biologic d isease -modify ing antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) among 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) pati ents in the real world. Biologic DMARDs currently  approved 
for RA include: Tumor -Necrosis F actor -
alpha inhibitors (TNFi) [adalimumab (Humir a), 
etanercept (Enbrel), certolizumab pegol (Cimzia), golimumab (
Simponi), inflixi mab 
(Remicade)] and non -TNFi’swith alternative mechanisms of action [abatacept (Orencia), 
and rituximab (Rituxan), anakinra ( Kineret), tocilizumab (Actemra)]. Biologic DMARD s 
have been used for man y years to treat RA with vary ing levels of success; howeve r, no study  
has compared the effectiveness and treatment patterns of tofacitinib to bDMARD s in a real 
world setting.
A simila r comparative analy sis focusing on the earl y expe rience with tofacitin ib was 
previously  conducted. This analy sisis designed to pro vide an updated charact erization of 
medication effectiveness and health care cost and utilization in RA patients treated wit h 
tofacitinib vs. bDMARD s in the period foll owing the initial introduction of tofacitinib , as 
well as a compariso nof the tofacitini b 11 mg QD and tofacitinib 5 mg BID formulations.
7.RESEARCH QUESTION AN D OBJECTIVES
The primary and secondary objectives will be conducted among patients who are identif ied 
from the Truven Health MarketScan Research
Database.
7.1.Primary Obje ctive
To compare RA -related costs among pa tients treated with tofacitinib (IR, XR and combined 
groups) to patients treated with each of the bDM ARD s (individually , as well as to TNFi and 
to non- TNFi each combined as groups).
7.2.Secondary Objectives
Explore the differences in dem ographic and clinical c haracteristics between patients 
treated with tofacitinib vs. each individual bDMARD
.
Compare treatment patterns including dosing, concomitant med ication use,
adherence, persistence, and switching with tofacitinib v s. each individual bDMARD .
Compare all -causeand RA-related health care utilization of patients treated with
tofacitinib vs. each individual bDMARD .

8. RESEARCH METHODS 
8.1.Study Design
To address theobjectives, a retrospective cohort design wi ll be employ edto evaluate patient
characteristics, treatment patterns ,medication effectiveness, and health car ecost and
utilization in RA patients newly initiating tofacitinib or bDMARD s between 
01February 2016and [ADDRESS_517084] been potentially two y ears of tofa citinib 
RAprescribing , and 
it is less likely that patien ts in later-line treatment will predominate. 
8.2. Setting
This study willutilize the de- identified claims data in the Truv en Health MarketScan
Research Database.
8.2.1. Inclusion Criteria
This study will include individual s who are privately insured (Truven MarketSc an 
Commercial Claims and Encounters (CCAE) database) and with Medicare Supplemental

Pre-index bDMARD use: The useofbDMARD sduring thepre-index period will be
identified. In addition, indicator variables will identify the specif ic bDMARD (s) used
during th e pre- index period.  A count will be creat ed to identify the number of
different bDMARD s received during the baseline. These measures will be created
during the 12 month baseline and during the e ntire variable length baseline per iod.
Pre-index csDMARD use: The use of csDMARDs (methotrexate, sulfa salazine,
hydroxy chloroquine, etc., other csDMARDs )willbeidentified during the pre -index
period. In addition, indicator variables will identify the specific medications used 
during the pre-index period.  A coun t will be created to identify the num ber o f 
different csDMARDs received during the baseline. These measures will be created 
during the 12 mont h baseline and during the entire variable length basel ine period.
Combination
vs.monotherapy: whether the patien tis treated with combination
therap y(ie,treated with anycsDMARDs ) or monotherap yat index will be
determined. Patients with ause of at least one of four specific cs DMARDs
(methotrexate, sulfasalazine, hydroxy chloroquine, leflunomide ) within 90 day s o n or 
after the index date willbeconsider ed as being treated with combination therapy .
Pre-index Quan -Charlson comorbidity score: A comorbidity score will be
calculated based onthepresence of diagnosis codes onmedical claims i nthe 
12-months pre-index period.2,3  The Quan -Charlson comorbidity score will also be
categorized intothefollowing groups: zero,onetotwo, three tofour, andfiveor 
more.
Pre-index medi cations -Themost common medications used
during the12-month
pre-and post -index periods will be identified. Themost common 25medications
received will be identified.
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480], non-steroidal an ti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use
-The use of weak
and/or strong opi[INVESTIGATOR_50942]/or non- steroidal anti -inflamma torydrug (NSAID) during
the 12- month pre-and 12-month post-index periods will be identified. The number of
pharmacy claims for opi[INVESTIGATOR_50953]/or NSAIDs and the number of daysfrom the index
date to the first opi[INVESTIGATOR_409989]/or NSAIDs claim willbeidentified .
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480], NSAID use while persist ent. In addition to opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]/NSAID use during the
follow -up,use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]/NSAIDs while persistent and after persistence w ill be
identified inthe12-month follow -up period.
Corticost eroid use.  The use of oral corticostero idsduring the 12-month pre-and
12-month post-index periods will be identified. Inaddition, the tota l 
prednisone -equivalent dose of oral corticosteroids
will be calculated.

Page 15Note: The total dose for corticosteroids is calculated as the sum(prednisone 
equivalent dose of administered corticosteroids) divided by  [CONTACT_410002] s 
supplied for medication given on the same date, and then averaged over all da tes on 
which patient was given c orticosteroid s .
Pre-index visit with a rheumatologist.  A 0/1 flag wil l be created to determine if the
patient had an ambulatory visits (office visit or outpatient visit) in which the phy sician
was a rheumatologist in the [ADDRESS_517089] visit in the entire variable length baseline and th e number of visits in 
the var iable length baseline.
Disease duration .  The num ber of daysfrom the earliest claim with a diagnosis of
RA in the variable length baseline until the index date will be identified. Disease
duration will only be created during the variable length baseline .
Pre-index Out-of-pocket expenses. The patient’s total all-cause and RA -related out
of pocket healthcare cost for healthcare services in 
theoneyear before the index date
and during the entire variable length baseline period will be calculated.
Comorb idities of interest. 0/1 flags will be cre ated to identify the presence of the
following comorbidities during the 12-month baseline period.
Cardiovascular diseases ;

Non-persistence. A 0/[ADDRESS_517090] y(or pre sumed day
supply )and fill dates of claims for the index medication (see Table 2for a listing of 
presumed da ysupplies) .
Persistence with the index medication will be defined as not having agap in therap y of at 
least 60 day sbetw eenfills/infusions.  For retail pharmacy (RX) claims the day suppl y will be 
utilized. ForHealthcare Common Procedure Codi ng System(HCPCS) claims a presumed 
daysupply derived from the product label will be utili zed. A gap of at least 60 daysbetween 
the run-outdate (service date + daysuppl y-1)and the next service date willbe considered 
non-persist ence. Patients with earlyrefills will be allowed to accumulate a s tockpi[INVESTIGATOR_409990] 14 daysfor later use.  Please see Section 8.11, for additional details 
on gap andvariables needed .
Post persistence treatment pattern s.Patients who are not persistent for the entire
follow -upperiod will be classified into the foll owing mutuall y exclusive categories
based on the first occurrence of non -persistence: switch immediate ly,discontinue
then restart, discontinue then switch, discontinue and never switch or r estart.
Switch immediate ly.Patients will be classified as switc hing immediatel yifthey
initiate a non-index bDMARD before a 60-daygap in treatment is observed for 
theindex medication.
Discontinue then restart.   Patie nts will be classified as discontin uing and then
restarting if there is agap in the index therapy  of at least [ADDRESS_517091]

prescriptions day ssuppl y will be c apped at end of follow -up. Also, th e MPR will be 
capped at 1.0.
Proportion of Day s Covered (PDC):
For all medications (except rituxima b) aproportion of day scovered (PDC) willbe
calculated based on total dayssuppl yover the 1yearfollow -up. The PDC w ill be
calculated by [CONTACT_410004] x 
medication. For patients thatreceive both infused andsubcutaneous (SC)
versions of medications, a presumed dayssupply will be attributed to each
infusion claim based on the product label Table 2.  Patients with early refills will 
be allowed to stockpi[INVESTIGATOR_409992] 14 day stotal forlater 
use.
For rituximab, because of the dos ing schedule PDC is not easily
 interpretable and 
may not be relevant. For purposes of inc lusion, if there are 3 or more rituximab
administrations, the patient will be considered adherent.

No increase in dose for in dex medication compared to t he starting dose. Dose
escalation will be identified per the criteria listed in Table 2.
No switching from the index medication to a (diffe rent) bDMARD or t ofacitinib. A 
switch will be defined as use of a different bDMARD or tofacitinib an y tim e during
the follow- up period.
No adding ofa new cs DMARD to the index therapy .Adding a new bDMARD will 
be considered as having at least [ADDRESS_517096], ie,failing the algorithm.  (That is, a ny csDMARD present 
during the 1-year post -index and not pr esent dur ing [ADDRESS_517097] effectiveness crit erion).

For pat ients with claims for oral gluc ocorticoids during the six months prior to the 
index date: No increase in oral glucocorticoid dose during months 6-12 after index 
comp ared to t he 6months before the index date. Increa
se in oral glucocorticoids 
will b e deter mine d from the prednisone equiv alent dose for all glucocorticoid 
claims filled during the respective time periods.
At most one parenteral orintra-articular glucoco rticoid j oint injection on unique 
daysafter the pa tient had been on bDMARD treatmen t for m ore than three 
months between (index date +91) to (index date +365).
NOTE: 
Patients having more than one glucocorticoid injec tion code on a single

Health care resource utilization -Health care resource utilization will be calculated
for ambulatory visits (office and outpatient), emergency department (ED) visits, and 
inpatient admissi ons.
RA-related resource health care utilization -Health care resource utilization related
to RA will be calculated for ambulatory visits, emergency room ( ER) visits, an d
inpatient admissions. Utilization willbedefined asRA-related if the claim had a
diagnosis fo r RA in anyposition and/or is for the administration of a bDMARD or 
csDMARD.
Health care costs -Health care costs will be computed as the combined health plan
and patient paid amounts. Costs will be calculated as total costs, pharmacy costs, and
medical c osts. See figure below.  ( Medical costs may be further broken down into
ambulatory costs, emergency services costs, inpatient costs, and other costs )
.
Costs will be adjusted using the annual medical care component of the Consumer 
Price Index (CP I) to refl ect inflation between 201 6(the earliest start of the pre-index
period) and 2018 (the cost of claims occurrin gin 201 9will not be adjusted).6See 
Annex 5.
Costs from other payers are o f importance for older patients duall yeligible for 
commercial and Medicare coverage. Payments from Medicare (and other payers) will
be
estimated based on coordination of benefits inform ation obtained by [CONTACT_410007]. This study will incorporate the amounts 
estimated to be paid b yother payers foratotal paid orallowable amount .7
RA-related health care cos ts-CPI-andcoordination ofbenefits (COB) -adjusted 
RA-relatedhealth care costs will be calculated a s total costs related to RA (treatment
and other medical claims with a diagnosis of RA). RA-related treatment costs will
include the cost of tofacitinib, bDMARD s, csDMARDs, and administration of
intravenous (I V) bDMARDs (CPT =[ZIP_CODE] or [ZIP_CODE]).
Medical cost s
will include all utilization with a diagnosis of RA and are also not 
treatment claims. Medical costs will comprise: inpatient costs, ambulatory costs,

The Truven Health MarketScan Research Databases reflects the combined healthcare service
use of individuals covered b yTruven H ealth clients (including employ ers, health plans, and
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]) nationwide. Truven Health builds databases comprise the healthcare experience of
the clients’ covered populations, as well as information about the populations themselves and 
the providers t hat serve them.  MarketScan Rese arch Databases provide detailed cost, 
utilization, and outcomes data for healthcare services performed in both inpatient and
outpatient settings. Inthe cla imsdatabases, the medical services are linked to outpati ent
prescr iption drug claims and person- level enrollment data using unique enrollee identifiers. 
The MarketScan Commercial Database contains thehealthcare experience ofprivatel y
insured individuals.  Cov erage is provided under a variet y offee-for-servi ce,fully capi[INVESTIGATOR_135162],
and partiall y capi[INVESTIGATOR_409994], including preferred provider organizations, point of
service plans, indemnit y plans, and health maintenance organizations.
Thedata that make up t heCommercial Database arestored inthefollowing tables:
T
he Inpatient Admissions Table contains records that summarize information about a
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]. Truven Health constructs this table after identify ingall of the 
service records associ ated withanadmission (eg, the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_139270], phy sician
claims, surgeon claims, andclaims from independent labs). Similar information 
(such as payments for professional services) is then summed across the claims. The
admission record includes t he pri ncipal procedure and diagnosis, Major Diagnostic 
Categor y, and Dia gnosis -Related Group. It also i ncludes all diagnoses and procedures 
(up to 14 each) found on the service records.
The Inpatient Services Table contains the individual claims that are summed to cre ate 
the inpatient admission records. An admissio n identifi er on both the Inpatient
Admissi ons and the Inpatient Services Tables identifies the claims that make up each
admission record.
The Outpatient Se rvices Table comprises services that were rend ered in adoctor’s
office, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_409995] ,or other outpatient facility .
The Facili ty Header Table contains the header records from facility claims for
inpatient andoutpatient services, including full diagnosis information.

tables that make upthe Medicare Supplemental Database are the same as those that 
make up the Commercial Database .
Claims are not included in the database until they have been adjudicate d; there is a lag of

EarlyView Database captures healthcare services incurred up to 90 daysbeforedata release 
and includes only adjudicate d claims. However, the me dical component of care for some 
patients will not be complete, since some claims (particularly  inpatient claims) take longer to 
be adjudicated. Because this study isexamining only comorbidities prior to and treatments
during or prior to tofacitinib initiation fully adjudicated claims are not required and all

•To compare RA-related costs among patients treated with tofacitinib (IR, XR and 
combined groups) to patients treated with each of the bDMARDs (individually, as well as to TNFi and to non-TNFi  each combined as groups).
 
For the descriptive analysis, 12-month RA-related cost measures will be 
presented per patient during the baseline and follow-up periods. The change in health care cost from baseline to follow-up will be identified. In addition, total RA-related health care cost will be presented in each of the months of the baseline and follow-up.   
8.10.2. Secondary Objectives
•Explore the differences in demographic and clinical characteristics between patients
treated with tofacitinib vs. each individual bDMARD.
For this objective descriptive analysis will be conducted.  
•Compare treatment patterns including dosing, concomitant medication use, 
adherence, persistence and switching with tofacitinib vs. each individual bDMARD.
For this objective, treatment patterns will be summarized across the cohorts of interest.CCI

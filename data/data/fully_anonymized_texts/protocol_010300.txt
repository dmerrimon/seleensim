or severe on the VRS, and (3) the subject’s pain is ≥[ADDRESS_1142655] will not be eligible for this study. Figure is not drawn to scale.

NPRS: numeric pain rating scale; VRS:  verbal categorical rating scale  
Notes: After completion of scr eening assessments and confirmation of eligibility, a subject 
will be assigned to treatment if (1) the subject’s pain is moderate or severe on the 
VRS, and (2) the subject’s pain is ≥[ADDRESS_1142656] 72 hours and that is expected to require no 
more than a short -term (i.e.,  <24-hour) admission. After surgery completion, a 
subject will be assig ned to treatment if (1) the subject requests the first dose of 
study drug for pain relief, (2)  the subject’s pain is moderate or severe on the VRS, 
and (3)  the subject’s pain is ≥[ADDRESS_1142657] does not meet the VRS 
and NPRS criteria within th e protocol -specified time period for the surgical 
procedure they underwent (e.g., [ADDRESS_1142658] procedures), the subject will not 
be eligible for this study.  
 

Protocol VX22 -548-107, Version 2.[ADDRESS_1142659] will begin treatment if (1) the subject’s pain is moderate or 
severe on the VRS, and (2) the subject’s pain is ≥[ADDRESS_1142660] been ongoing for ≤[ADDRESS_1142661] s 
Approximately 250  subjects will receive VX -548 ([ADDRESS_1142662] dose, then 50 mg 
every 12  hours [q12h]). Subjects will continue to receive VX -[ADDRESS_1142663]. An acetaminophen/ibuprofen 
combination may be  used as a rescue medication for pain relief as needed (prn), 
starting any time after the first dose of study drug through Day 14, completion of 
study drug treatment due to pain resolution, or study drug discontinuation, 
whichever occurs first. Subjects wi ll be permitted to take acetaminophen 
650 mg/ibuprofen 400  mg every 6  hours (q6h) prn, up to a maximum of 
2600  mg/1600  mg in any 24 -hour period.  
The following approach will be used to define pain resolution and completion of 
study drug treatment:  
1. Pain is c onsidered to be resolved  and the study drug treatment will be 
considered completed if  
a. a subject takes no study drug during a 48 -hour period (i.e., skipped at 
least 4  consecutive doses due to pain resolution ); and  
b. a subject takes no more than 1 dose of acetaminophen/ibuprofen during 
each 24 -hour period within the 48 -hour period (i.e., no more than 2 doses 
in 48 hours ). 
2. If a subject stops taking study drug per Criterion 1a but does not meet 
Criterion 1b, they will be instructed to restart study drug (and prn rescue 
medication).  
3. If a subject stops and restarts study drug (Criterion  2 above) and subsequently 
believes their pain is resolving and stops study drug a second time, they will 
be instructed to not restart study drug, regardless of whether the above 
criteria are met.  
4. If a subject stops study drug a second time after the restart of dosing 
(Criterion 3 above) and then fulfills  both Criterion 1a and 1b, the pain is 
considered resolved and study drug treatment will be considered completed. 
If the subject fulfills only Criterion 1a but not Criterion 1b after the restart of 
dosing, the pain is considered not resolved and study drug will be considered 
discontinued.  
Note: If subject stops study drug due to pain resolution less than [ADDRESS_1142664] sch eduled dose of study drug (i.e., stops after the second dose on Day 12) 
and therefore cannot meet Criterion 1a by [CONTACT_2006] 14, the subject will be considered 
to have completed study drug dosing  as long as they  also meet Criterion 1b.  
  
Assessments  Safety : adv erse events (AEs); clinical laboratory assessments; clinical evaluation 
of vital signs, standard 12 -lead ECGs, and physical examinations; and

treatment options for pain are limited by [CONTACT_351582] (AEs),  
leaving many patients without adequate pain control. Nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs 
(NSAIDs) pose a potentially serious risk of gastrointestinal toxicity with acute and chronic use, 
hematologic toxicity with acute use, and nephrotoxicity with chroni c use.[ADDRESS_1142711] 2 decades.2 Opi[INVESTIGATOR_824079] d in more than 70,000 overdose deaths in the US in 2020 and in approximately 76% of 
fatal drug overdoses in the EU in 2019.3, [ADDRESS_1142712] on the opi[INVESTIGATOR_351568]6; few  new molecular entity drugs for moderate 
to severe pain have been approved.7, [ADDRESS_1142713] substantially improved efficacy or safety.  
Voltage -gated sodium channel 1.8 (Na V1.8) plays a critical role in pain signaling.9, 10 Support for 
this assertion arises from (1)  evaluation of the r ole Na V1.8 plays in normal physiology11-15, 
(2) pathological states arising from mutations in the Na V1.8 gene (SCN10A)16, 17, (3) animal 
models18-21, and (4)  pharmacology of known Na V1.8-modulating agents.22-24 In addition, because 
NaV1.8 expression is restricted to peripheral neurons, particularly those that sense pain (e.g.,  the 
dorsal root ganglia [DRG])11, 13, Na V1.8 inhibitors are less likely to be as sociated with the side 
effects commonly observed with other sodium channel modulators and the abuse liability 
associated with opi[INVESTIGATOR_218947]. Therefore, targeting the underlying biology of pain through 
selective Na V1.8 inhibition represents a novel appro ach to analgesic drug development that has 
the potential to address an urgent unmet need for safe and effective acute and chronic pain

subject’s pain is ≥[ADDRESS_1142727] been ongoing 
for ≤48 hours at presentation.

Approximately 250 subjects will receive VX -548 ([ADDRESS_1142728] dose, then 50 mg every 12  hours 
[q12h]). Subjects will continue to receive VX -[ADDRESS_1142729]. An acetaminophen/ibuprofen combination may be used as a rescue 
medication for pain relief as needed (prn), starting any time after the first dose of study drug 
through Day 14, completion of study drug treatment due to pain resolution, or study drug 
discontinu ation, whichever occurs first. Subjects will be permitted to take acetaminophen 
650 mg/ibuprofen 400  mg every 6 hours (q6h) prn, up to a maximum of 2600  mg/1600 mg in 
any 24 -hour period.  

Protocol VX22 -548-107, Version 2.0 Page 29 of 62

 Confidential Information  The following approach will be used to define pain resolution and completion of study drug 
treatment:  
1. Pain is considered to be resolved and the study drug treatment will be considered completed 
if 
a. a subject takes no study drug during a 48 -hour period (i.e., skipped at least 4  consecutive 
doses due to pain resolution ); and 
b. a subject takes no more than 1 dose of acetaminophen/ibuprofen during each 24 -hour 
period within the 48 -hour period (i.e.,  no more than 2 doses in 48 hours ).  
2. If a subject stops taking study drug per Criterion 1a but does not meet Criterion 1b, they will  
be instructed to restart study drug (and prn rescue medication).  
3. If a subject stops and restarts study drug (Criterion 2 above) and subsequently believes their 
pain is resolving and stops study drug a second time, they will be instructed to not restart 
study drug, regardless of whether the above criteria are met.  
4. If a subject stops study drug a second time after the restart of dosing (Criterion 3 above) and 
then fulfills both Criterion 1a and 1b, the pain is considered resolved and study drug 
treatment wil l be considered completed.  If the subject fulfills Criterion 1a but not 
Criterion  1b after the restart of dosing, the  pain is considered not resolved and study drug 
will be con sidered discontinued.  
Note If a subject stops study drug due to pain resolution  less than [ADDRESS_1142730]

meet Criterion 1a by [CONTACT_2006]  14, the subject will be considered to have completed study drug dosing  
as long as they also  meet Cr iterion 1b.   
9.1.1  Screening  
Surgical Subjects  
Assessments from screening through admission (pre -procedure) are listed in Table  3-1. 
The Screening Visit will occur within 28  days before the scheduled surgical procedure and may 
occur in the clinic or as a home health visit with a qualified visiting nurse if permitted by [CONTACT_13125]. The investigator (or an appropriate authorized designee at the study site) will obtain 
informed consent from each subject in person or remotely (Section  13.2.3 ) before performing 
any study -related procedure. If needed, Screening Visit ass essments may be performed on 
different days within the screening period (e.g., informed consent may be obtained before the 
home health visit, if applicable).  
Non-surgical Subjects  
Assessments from screening through treatment assigned are listed in Table 3-3. 
The Screening Visit will occur on Day  [ADDRESS_1142731] presents with pain at a medical facility. 
The investigator (or an appropriate authorized d esignee at the study site) will obtain informed 
consent from each subject before performing any study -related procedure. However, previous 
test results from the facility’s local laboratory may be used to establish eligibility if collected 
within [ADDRESS_1142732] eligibility,  before treatment assignment may occur, including VRS and (if the subject’s 
pain is rated moderate or severe on the VRS) NPRS.  
All Subjects  
To prepare for study p articipation, subjects will be instructed on the study restrictions 
(Section  9.4). 
Subjects will be instructed during screening on appropriate expectations around their 
participation in a clinical study and the importance of accurately reporting their post -procedural 
pain. At the Screening Visit, subjects will receive trainings on accurate pain reporting, clinical 
study participation, and use of the electronic diary (e -diary) for recording study drug 
administration, rescue medication use, and the PGA. On Day  1 (pre -procedure), these trainings 
will be repeated for surgical subjects; for non -surgical subjects, only 1 training is required 
because the  Screening Visit is on Day 1 . Additional review of  these educational materials may be 
repeated for some or all subjects, as needed.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Repetition of Screening Assessment(s)  
Repetition of any screening assessment that did not meet eligibility criteria is not permitted, 
unless there is clear evidence of a laboratory error (e.g.,  hemolysis of sample, equipment error).  
In all cases, the medical monitor must authorize retesting.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Rescreening (Surgical Subjects Only)  
Subjects who do not meet the eligibility criteria  may not be rescreened, with the following 
exceptions:  
• Subjects who met all eligibility criteria but had an intercurrent illness (e.g.,  upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_351574]) in the [ADDRESS_1142733] dose of study drug that was properly 
evaluated an d which resolved fully  
• Subjects who met all eligibility criteria but were not able to obtain required documentation 
within the allotted screening window  
• Subjects who met all eligibility criteria but transiently (for personal reasons) are unable to 
commit t o all study procedures  
• Subjects who were screened under a prior version of the protocol and did not meet any 
exclusion criterion, with the exception of a criterion that was updated in a subsequent version 
of the protocol  
Any subject who is rescreened for a ny of the exceptions listed above may have the screening 
window extended by [ADDRESS_1142734] approve all rescreening and/or 
screening window extension requests before these occur.  
9.1.2  Surgical Procedure Through Treatment Assignment (Surgical 
Subjects)  
Assessments to be completed after the surgical procedur e through treatment assignment are listed 
in Table  3-2.  
All study periods will be conducted as described in Section  9.1. 
Protocol VX22 -548-107, Version 2.0 Page 31 of 62 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  
 Confidential Information  Use of drains for all relevant procedures will be at the discretion of the surgical team.  
In the perioperative period, pain management agents will be used according to Section  [IP_ADDRESS] . 
All other standard -of-care agents (e.g., anti -emetics) are allowed except those which are 
specifically restricted ( Table  9-1). Section  9.[ADDRESS_1142735] administration of 
supplemental analgesia (i.e., fentanyl; Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ).  
In the postoperative period before treatment assignment, VRS will be completed upon request for 
the first dose of study drug for pain relief. NPRS will be completed after VRS only if the 
subject’s pain is rated moderate or severe on the VRS. If a subject does not meet the VRS and 
NPRS criteria within the protocol -specified time period for the surgical procedure they 
underwent (Section  8.1), the subject will not be eligible for this study.  
9.1.3  Treatment Period  
Treatment Period assessments are listed in Table  3-4 (surgical and non-surgical subjects).  
All study periods will be conducted as described in Section  9.1. Dosing details are in Section  9.6. 
If a subject has any clinically significant, study -related abnormalities at the time that they meet 
discharge/leaving criteria from where the surgical procedure was condu cted or non -surgical 
condition was treated (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], clinic, or ambulatory center), the medical monitor (or 
authorized designee) will be notified, and the subject will be asked to remain (e.g., in the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], clinic, or ambulatory center) until su ch abnormalities resolve. If the subject is unable or 
unwilling to remain, the medical monitor (or authorized designee) will be notified, and the 
investigator will make every effort to arrange follow -up evaluations at appropriate intervals to 
document the course of the abnormalities.  
Although the inpatient period, if any, is generally expected to be <24 hours (Section  8.1), 
subjects who turn out to require a stay of ≥[ADDRESS_1142736] dose of study 
drug (Day  28 ± 2 days). Safety Follow -up Visit assessments are listed in Table  3-4.

Subjects who discontinue or complete study drug treatment before Day 14 will also be required 
to complete the Safety Follow -up Visit (Section  9.1.4 ). In the unlikely event that the EDV is 
delayed and occurs [ADDRESS_1142739] withdraws  consent for the study, no further assessments will be performed; the study 
data and samples collected will remain part of the study (Section  9.8). 
9.1.[ADDRESS_1142740] a consultation (i.e.,  telemedicine video conference or telephone contact) 
between the subject and investigator or q ualified delegate (licensed independent practitioner 
[LIP]) within [ADDRESS_1142741] is defined as one of the following:  
• For enrolled subjects who have a Safety Follow -up Visit: through the Safety Follow -up Visit  
• For enrolled subjects who do not have a Safety Follow -up Visit: the d ate of last contact  
[CONTACT_660317]  13.2.[ADDRESS_1142742] of VX -548 after 
multiple kinds of surgeries and non -surgical conditions resulting in acute pain; broad categories 
of surgeries and non -surgical acute pain conditions were included to obtain comprehensive safety 
data. Moreover, the use of VX -548 will be primarily in an outpatient setting as the selected 
surgeries/conditions generally require no more than a short -term (i.e., <24 -hour) admission. For 
the surgical subjects, the procedures and postoperative care, including methods for acute pain 
management, follow standard of care with minimal restrictions on the surgical and anesthetic 
parameters for the specified procedures. Clinician s may generally use what they consider to be 
standard of care in the US, while remaining within protocol specifications. Given that the study 
is intended primarily to collect safety information, an open -label, single -arm study design is 
appropriate.  
The gu iding considerations for the eligible surgical models and non -surgical pain conditions are 
that (1) they result in at least a moderate level of pain that lasts between 7 and 14 days; and 
(2) the surgical procedures (where applicable) historically are perfo rmed on an ambulatory basis. 
Consistent with the FDA requirements for premarketing safety databases, the proposed 
population adequately represents the target population (i.e.,  patients with moderate to severe 
Protocol VX22 -548-107, Version 2.0 Page 33 of 62 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  
 Confidential Information  acute pain).27 To approximate use in a “real -world” setting, inclusion and exclusion criteria were 
designed to enroll a clinically diverse population that is more generalizable to clinical practice. 
The eligible surgical procedures and  non-surgical conditions support an evaluation of VX -548 in 
subjects with sufficiently diverse sources of acute pain (e.g., both bony and soft tissue) for the 
expected duration of use. The surgical procedures represent the broad categories of general, 
orthopedic, otolaryngology, breast, colorectal, gynecologic, urologic, and plastic and 
reconstructive surgery. The non -surgical conditions include traumatic and atraumatic acute 
musculoskeletal pain, orofacial pain, burns, and cutaneous and soft tissue pain.  
Following the scheduled surgical procedure or presentation at a medical facility with acute pain, 
subjects will be assigned to treatment after their pain meets threshold criteria using both a VRS 
and an NPRS. The pain threshold criteria are designed to ensu re subjects have moderate to 
severe pain. A 4 -point VRS (none, mild, moderate, or severe) is included as part of the pain 
threshold inclusion criterion to allow rapid assessment of subjects’ baseline pain on a repeated 
basis in the immediate postoperative period. The NPRS, a frequently used, valid pain intensity 
measure recognized by [CONTACT_1622]28, is included at baseline to further define and quantify subjects 
as having moderate to severe pain (i.e., ≥4 on a n 11-point [0 to 10] scale).  
Ibuprofen and acetaminophen were selected as the rescue medications because they are 
commonly used, short -acting, standard -of-care treatments for acute pain.  
9.3.2  Study Drug Dose and Duration  
The VX -548 dosing regimen of 100 mg firs t dose (loading dose), then 50 mg q12h was selected 
based on favorable safety and pharmacokinetic data from healthy subjects and subjects with pain 
after bunionectomy or abdominoplasty. Exposures at the selected VX -548 dose are predicted to 
achieve Na V1.8 inhibition levels of approximately 90% by [ADDRESS_1142743] udy Assessments  
PGA of study drug:  The PGA captures subjects’ perceptions of the study drug’s effectiveness in 
treating pain using a validated, single -item questionnaire.29 This study will use a 5 -point Likert 
scale (poor, fair, good, very good, or excellent) for the PGA evaluation.30

result is not required for eligibility; however, until the test result is received, a subject will be 
considered to be of childbearing poten tial and must follow contraception requirements 
(Section [IP_ADDRESS] ) until postmenopausal status is confirmed.  
• Pregnancy Testing : Surgical subjects: All biologically female subjects will have a serum 
beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (β -hCG) test during the S creening Visit. Female subjects 
of childbearing potential ( Section [IP_ADDRESS] ) will also have a urine β -hCG test before 
admission on Day 1. Both the serum and urine β -hCG test must be negative to receive study 
drug. Non-surgical subjects: All biologically female subjects will have a urine β -hCG test 
during the Screening Visit, which occurs on Day 1; the test must be negative to receive study 
drug.  
• Drug  and Alcohol Screening:  Drug screening for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], methadone, cannabinoids, cocaine, 
amphetamines/methamphetamines, barbiturates, and benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_306003] a 
urine test at the Screening Visit and before admission on  Day 1; for non -surgical s ubjects, 
only [ADDRESS_1142769] is required because the Screening Visit is on Day 1.  Alcohol screening will be 
assessed before admission (surgical subjects) or treatment assignment (non -surgical subjects) 
on Day [ADDRESS_1142770] to receive study drug; a positive marijuana screen will only be 
exclusionary on Day  1. A positive drug  screen for a known prescribed concomitant 
medication that is not otherwise exclusionary (e.g.,  benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651]) will not disqualify 
subjects.  
Additional Evaluations : Additional clinical laboratory evaluations will be performed at other 
times if judged to be clinically appropriate.  
For purposes of study conduct, only laboratory tests done in the central laboratory may be used, 
with the following exceptions:  
• Day 1 (pre -procedure, if applicable) drug and alcohol tests and urine β -hCG pregnancy tests 
will be a ssessed by [CONTACT_351581].  
• For non-surgical subjects , local laboratories will be used for safety laboratory tests at 
screening.  
• For surgical subjects , local laboratories may be used to repeat a screening assessment to 
determine eligibility on  Day 1 (pre -procedure)  if there is clear evidence of laboratory error 
(Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ) in the central laboratory assessment.  
Local laboratories may be used at the discretion of the local investigator for management of 
urgent medical issues. If a local laboratory test value is found to be abnormal and clinically 
significant, it will be verified by [CONTACT_824089]. If it is not possible to send a timely specimen to the 
central laboratory (e.g.,  the subject was hospi[INVESTIGATOR_94248]), the investigator may base the 
assessment of an AE on the local laboratory value.

 Confidential Information  can be performed at the discretion of the inve stigator or healthcare provider . If the Screening 
Visit occurs via home health (surgical subjects only), an abbreviated PE will be performed at 
screening and a complete PE will be performed on Day 1 . 
A PE includes a review of the following systems: head, n eck, and thyroid; eyes, ears, nose, and 
throat (EENT); respi[INVESTIGATOR_696]; cardiovascular; lymph nodes; abdomen; skin; musculoskeletal; and 
neurological. Breast, anorectal, and genital examinations will be performed when medically 
indicated. After screening, any clinically significant abnormal findings in PEs will be reported as 
AEs.  
The abbreviated PE will include an assessment of the following body systems: general; 
cardiovascular system; respi[INVESTIGATOR_2133]; skin; and abdomen.  
A focused PE of the operative site (surgical subjects only) will be performed in order to assess 
wound healing.  
Vital signs include blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), temperature, pulse rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_11943], and oxygen saturation (SpO 2). The subject will be instructed to rest (seate d or supi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) for at 
least [ADDRESS_1142772] 12 -lead ECGs will be performed at any other time if clinically indicated. The 
performance of all ECGs will adhere to the following guidelines:  
• The ECG will be done before blood draws or any other procedures that may affect heart rate.  
• The subject will be instructed to rest (supi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) for at least 5  minutes before having an ECG.  
• The test should be performed in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_617981].  
The acceptable window for the 4 -hour postdose ECG is ±  [ADDRESS_1142773]. 
Clinically significant ECG abnormalities occurring during the study through the Safety 
Follow -up Visit will be recorded as AEs.   
To ensure safety of the subjects, a qualified individual at the study site will  make comparisons to 
baseline measurements. If the median  QTcF is increased by >60  msec from the baseline or the 
median  absolute QTcF value is ≥500  msec for any scheduled or unscheduled  ECG s (performed 
in triplicate) , 2 additional ECGs (performed in tripli cate)  will be performed approximately 2  to 
4 minutes apart to confirm the original measurement. If the median  QTcF value from either of  
these repeated ECGs remains above the threshold value (>60  msec from baseline or ≥500  msec), 
the subject should  disconti nue dosing. For safety monitoring after discontinuation,  a single ECG 
will be repeated at least hourly until QTcF values from 2  successive ECGs fall below the 
threshold value that triggered the repeat measurement.

11.5.6  Contraception and Pregnancy  
The effects of VX‑548 on conception, pregnancy , and lactation in humans are not known. Refer 
to the VX‑548 Investigator’s Brochure for additional details.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Contraception  
Study participation requires compliance with the contraception guidelines outlined below . 
Contraception for the couple is waived for the following:  
• True abstinence for the subject. The subject must confirm that they will practice true 
abstinence from the Screening Visit through [ADDRESS_1142774] dose of study drug. True 
abstinence is important to differentiate from p eriodic abstine nce (e.g.,  calendar, ovulation, 
symptothermal, postovulation methods) and withdrawal , which  are not acceptable methods of 
contraception.  
• If the male is infertile (e.g., bilateral orchiectomy). Infertility may be documented through 
examination of a semen s pecimen.  
• If the female is of non -childbearing potential. To be considered of non -childbearing potential, 
the female must meet at least 1 of the following criteria:  
o Postmenopausal: Amenorrheic for at least 12 consecutive months and a serum FSH 
level within the laboratory ’s reference range for postmenopausal females  
o Documented bilateral oophorectomy and/or hysterectomy  
• Same biological sex relationships.  
For subjects for whom the contraception requirement is not waived , study participation 
requires a commitment from the subject that at least [ADDRESS_1142775] dose of study drug:  
• Male vasectomy [ADDRESS_1142776]-vasectomy semen analysis for spe rmb 
• Female bilateral tubal ligation performed at least 6 months previously  
• Female continuous use of an intrauterine device for at least [ADDRESS_1142777] 
dose of study drug  
• Female hormonal contraceptives, if successfully used for at least [ADDRESS_1142778] dose of study drug  
• Male or female condom (with or without spermicide )c 
• Female barrier contraception (such as diaphragm, cervical cap, or sponge) with 
spermicide  
a Applicable to subjects and their non -study partners of the opposite biological sex for whom the contraception 
requirement is not waived. 
b Medical record documentation of contraception for non -study partners is not required. The subject must 
confirm that their partner has documented proof, and the subject’s confirmation should be documented.  
c Female condom cannot be used with male condom due to risk of tea ring.  
Additional notes:  
• If over the course of the study the subject meets the criteria for waiving the contraception 
requirements, the subject does not need to follow the contraceptive methods listed in 
Table  11-2. 
• Male subjects must not donate sperm from the first dose of study drug, throughout the study, 
and for [ADDRESS_1142779] dose of study drug.  
• Male and female subjects who are not sexually  active at the time of screening must agree to 
follow the contraceptive requirements of this study if they become sexually active with a 
partner of the opposite biological sex.  
• Medical record documentation of contraception for non -study partners is not req uired.  
• If applicable, additional contraception requirements may need to be followed according to 
local regulations and/or requirements.  
Unique situations that may not fall within the above specifications may be discussed with the 
Vertex medical monitor or designee on an individual basis.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pregnancy  
Subjects will be counseled to inform the investigator of any pregnancy that occurs during study 
treatment and for [ADDRESS_1142780], b ecomes pregnant while participating in the 
study, the study drug will be permanently discontinued immediately. The investigator will 
(1) notify the medical monitor and Vertex GPS within 24  hours of the site’s knowledge of the 
subject’s (or partner’s) pregn ancy, and (2) send the Pregnancy Information Collection Form to 
Vertex GPS.

13.1 Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Documentation, Severity 
Grading, and Reporting  
13.1.1  Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Definition of an Adverse Event  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject during the study; the event 
does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. This includes any newly 
occurring event or worsening of a pre -existing condition (e.g.,  increase in its severity or 
frequency) after the ICF is signed.  
An AE is considered serious if it meets the definition in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] .  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Clinically Significant Assessments  
Study assessments including laboratory tests, ECGs, PEs, and vital signs will be assessed and 
those deemed to have clinically significant worsening from baseline wi ll be documented as an 
AE. When possible, a clinical diagnosis for the study assessment will be provided, rather than the 
abnormal test result alone (e.g.,  urinary tract infection, anemia). In the absence of a diagnosis, 
Protocol VX22 -548-107, Version 2.0 Page 48 of 62 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  
 Confidential Information  the abnormal study assessment itsel f will be listed as the AE (e.g.,  bacteria in urine or decreased 
hemoglobin).  
An abnormal study assessment is considered clinically significant if the subject has 1  or more of 
the following:  
• Concomitant signs or symptoms related to the abnormal study asses sment  
• Further diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention  
• A change in the dose of study drug or discontinuation from the study  
Repeat testing to determine whether the result is abnormal, in the absence of any of the above 
criteria, does not necessarily meet clinically significant criteria. The determination of whether the 
study assessment results are clinically significant will be made by [CONTACT_093].  
A laboratory value that is Grade [ADDRESS_1142787]’s clinical status indicates a life -threatening AE.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Documentation of Adverse Events  
All AEs will be collected in source documents from the time the ICF is signed until completion 
of study participation (Section  9.1.7 ). 
All subjects will be queried, using nonleading questions, about the occurrence of AEs at each 
study visit. When possible, a constellation of signs a nd/or symptoms will be identified as 
[ADDRESS_1142788]’s source documents. The following data will be documented for each AE:  
• Description of the event  
• Classification of “serious” or “nonserious”  
• Date of first occurrence and date of resolution (if applicable)  
• Severity  
• Causal relationship to study drug(s)  
• Action taken  
• Outcome  
• Concomitant medication or other treatment given  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Event Severity  
The investigator will determine and record the severity of all serious and nonserious AEs. The 
guidance available at the following website will be consulted: Common Terminology Criteria  for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version  5.0, Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm  (Accessed 
May 2022). The severity of an AE described by a term that does not appear in the CTCAE will

[IP_ADDRESS]  Adver se Event  Causality  
Every effort will be made by [CONTACT_63398], if any, to the 
study drug(s). Causality will be classified using the categories in Table  13-2. 
Table  13-[ADDRESS_1142789] been ruled out, 
and/or the event reappeared on re -exposure to the investigational stud y drug.  
Possibly related  There is an association between the event and the administration of the 
investigational study drug and there is a plausible mechanism for the event to be 
related to investigational study drug, but there may also be alternative eti ology, 
such as characteristics of the subject’s clinical status or underlying disease.  
Unlikely related  The event is unlikely to be related to the investigational study drug and likely to be 
related to factors other than investigational study drug.  
Not related  The event is related to an etiology other than the investigational study drug (the 
alternative etiology will be documented in the subject’s medical record).  
AE: adverse event  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Study Drug Action Taken  
The investigator will classify the study drug action taken with regard to the AE. The action taken 
will be classified according to the categories in Table  13-3.

ongoing  
Fatal  Outcome of an AE is death. “Fatal” will be used when death is at least possibly 
related to the AE.  
Unknown  Outcome of an AE is not known (e.g.,  a subject lost to follow up)  
AE: adverse event  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Treatment Given  
The investigator ensures adequate medical care is provided to subjects for any AEs, including 
clinically significant laboratory values related to study drug. In addition, the investigator will 
describe whether any treatment was given for the AE. “Yes” is used if any treatment was given 
in response to an AE and may include tre atments such as other medications, surgery, or physical 
therapy. “No” indicates the absence of any kind of treatment for an AE.  
13.1.2  Serious Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any AE that meets any of the following outcomes:  
• Fatal (d eath, regardless of cause, that occurs during participation in the study or occurs after 
participation and is suspected of being a delayed toxicity due to administration of the study 
drug)  
• Life-threatening, such that the subject was at immediate risk of de ath from the reaction as it 
occurred  
Protocol VX22 -548-107, Version 2.0 Page 51 of 62 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  
 Confidential Information  • Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_318]  
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity (disability is defined as a substantial disruption 
of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions)  
• Congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• Important medical event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the 
subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent  1 of the outcomes listed 
above (e.g.,  an allergic bronchospasm req uiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or 
at home)  
If a subject has a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29918] (e.g.,  surgery) for an event or condition that 
occurred before the subject signed the ICF, and the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_94250], the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_168788], unless an AE caused the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_94252]. In addition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_824083] (e.g.,  social hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8933]) will not be 
considered to indicate an SAE.  
Clarification will be made between the terms “serious” and “severe” because they are not 
synonymous. The term “sev ere” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific 
event, as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction. The event itself, however, may be 
of relatively minor medical significance, such as a severe headache. This is not the same as 
“serious”, which is based on subject/event outcome or action described above and is usually 
associated with events that pose a threat to a subject’s life or functioning. Seriousness, not 
severity, serves as a guide for defining expedited regulatory repo rting obligations.   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reporting and Documentation of Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs that occur after obtaining informed consent through the Safety Follow -up Visit, 
regardless of causality, will be reported by [CONTACT_351593] 24 hours o f

particular site. In addition, for reasonable cause, either the investigators or their IRB s/IECs may 
terminate the study at their center.  
Conditions that may lead to reasonable cause and warrant termination include, but are not limited 
to: 
• Subject or investigator noncompliance  
• Unsatisfactory subject enrollment  
• Lack of adherence to protocol proc edures  
• Lack of evaluable and/or complete data  
• Potentially unacceptable risk to study subjects  
• Decision to modify drug development plan

valida ted, web -based electronic data capture (EDC) application. The investigator will affirm the 
completeness and accuracy of the data by [CONTACT_660325]. If applicable, 
periodic investigator signatures may also be required.  
Instances of m issing, discrepant, or uninterpretable data will be queried with the investigator for 
resolution.  
13.[ADDRESS_1142797]. It is the investigator’s responsibility to 
ensure the accuracy, completeness, clarity, and timeliness of the data reported in t he subject’s 
CRF. Source documentation supporting the CRF data will indicate the subject’s participation in 
the study and will document the dates and details of study procedures, AEs, other observations, 
and subject status.  
The investigator, or designated representative, will complete the CRF as soon as possible after 
information is collected.  
The audit trail entry will show the user’s identification information and the date and time of any 
correction. The investigator will provide formal approval of all t he information in the CRFs, 
including any changes made to them, to endorse the final submitted data for the subjects for 
whom the investigator is responsible.  
Vertex will retain the CRF data  and corresponding audit trails. A copy of the final archival CRF  
will be placed in the investigator’s study  file. 
13.[ADDRESS_1142798] party except to such of the investigator’s employees and staff as have been made aware 
that the information is confidential and who are bound to treat it as such and to whom disclosure 
is necessary to evaluate that information. The investigator shall not use such information for any 
purpose other than determining mutual interest in performing the study and, if the parties decide 
to proceed  with the study, for the purpose of conducting the study.  
The investigator understands that the information developed from this clinical study will be used 
by [CONTACT_155435], 
and therefore may be disclosed as required to other clinical investigators, business partners and 
associates, the FDA, and other government agencies. The investigator also understands that, to 
allow for the use of the information derived from the clinical stud y, the investigator has the 
obligation to provide Vertex with complete test results and all data developed in the study.  
13.7 Publications and Clinical Study Report  
13.7.1  Publication of Study Results  
Vertex is committed to reporting the design and results of all clin ical studies in a complete, 
accurate, balanced, transparent, and timely manner, consistent with Good Publication Practices 
(GPP3).32

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  
 Confidential Information  Authorship : Authorship of publications will be determined based on the Recommendations for 
Conduct, Reporting, Editing, and Publi cation of Scholarly Work in Medical Journals, which 
states that authorship should be based on the following 4 criteria:  
1. Substantial contributions to conception and design, acquisition of data, or analysis and 
interpretation of data;  
2. Drafting of the article or revising it critically for important intellectual content;  
3. Final approval of the version to be published; and  
4. Agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related 
to the accuracy or integrit y of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and 
resolved.  
All authors must meet conditions 1, 2, 3, and 4. All persons designated as authors should qualify 
for authorship, and all those who qualify should be listed. Contributions such as medic al writing, 
enrollment of subjects, acquisition of funding, collection of data, or general supervision of the 
research group, alone, do not justify authorship.  
Contributors : Contributors who meet fewer than all 4 of International Committee of Medical 
Journal Editors (ICMJE) criteria for authorship will not be listed as authors, but their 
contribution will be acknowledged and specified either as a group (e.g., “study investigators”) or 
individually (e.g., “served as scientific advisor”).  
Publication Review : As required by a separate clinical study agreement, Vertex must have the 
opportunity to review all publications, including any manuscripts, abstracts, oral/slide 
presentations, and book chapters regarding this study before submission to congresses or jou rnals 
for consideration.  
13.7.2  Clinical Study Report  
A clinical study report (CSR), written in accordance with the current ICH E3 Guideline, will be 
submitted in accordance with local regulations.

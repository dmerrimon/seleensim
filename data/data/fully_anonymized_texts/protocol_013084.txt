Health behaviors are major, modifiable risk factors for the development and progression of chronic 
diseases, which account for a large proportion of all deaths in the US and contribute to disparities in premature mortality based on both income and race. There is substantial evidence, for 
example, that behaviors like smoking, physical inactivity, and unhealthy diet are associated with 
an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), as are modifiable factors such as blood pressure, cholesterol, body mass index, and fasting glucose. A growing body of research 
suggests that poverty may affect health behaviors through financial and psychological pathways. However, few studies have rigorously examined the effects of poverty alleviation interventions on 
health behaviors, particularly among individuals at high risk for CVD. Even fewer studies have 
examined potential psychological mechanisms by [CONTACT_15279] -poverty interventions might 
influence health behavior. This pi[INVESTIGATOR_679284], an economic intervention that is gaining traction among policymakers, on risk factors for CVD and other chronic diseases. The project will focus on low -income adults in Philadelphia who have at 
least one health risk factor for CVD (type 2 diabetes/pre- diabetes and/or hypertension) and 
examine whether short -term, unconditional cash transfer payments result in changes in objective 
and self -reported health outcomes. Our second aim will examine potential psychological 
mechanisms through which the cash transfer intervention may affect study participants’ behavior, 
including mental health, psychosocial str ess, bandwidth, and future orientation. Our third aim will 
use qualitative methods to understand participants’ experiences with this study. The project 
activities will include developi[INVESTIGATOR_679285] (Stage 1) as well as 
basic  science analysis of mechanisms of change (Stage 0).  
 
2. Objectives  and Aims  
 
We will conduct a pi[INVESTIGATOR_9416] a short -term unconditional cash transfer provision and evaluate its 
effects on health behaviors and outcomes. Our overall goals are to assess the feasibility and 
acceptability of the intervention, to measure key outcomes that may be affected by [CONTACT_25234], and to identify plausible intervention effect sizes that can be used to conduct a larger 
trial. Our specific aims are:  
 
Aim 1: Determine the effect of an unconditional cash transfer provision on specific health 
behaviors that influence CVD risk, financial outcomes, and health risk factors that are 
directly related to insufficient financial resources (food and utility securi ty) (Stage 1, create 
and test new behavioral interventions).  In partnership with Penn Family Care clinics, we will 
identify potential participants who may be eligible for the study. We will then enroll and randomize 
about 100 low -income adults with either hypertension or pre -diabetes/diabetes to either: 1) usual 
care or 2) eight cash transfer payments of $125 every two weeks (for a total of $1000 over 4 
months). At baseline and at 3 months (before the eighth payment, to minimize the influence the 
interventi on ending has on follow up measures), we will assess our primary outcomes of health 
behaviors (health care utilization, medication adherence, smoking behavior, and alcohol use), 
financial outcomes (health care expenditures, financial stress) and health ris k factors associated 
with insufficient financial resources (food and utility insecurity). We will also examine secondary health outcomes including self -reported health- related quality of life, and objectively measured 
body mass index and blood pressure.

Pi[INVESTIGATOR_679282]: 08.08.2023  Aim 2: A ssess potential psychological mechanisms through which the intervention  
influences cardiovascular health (Stage 0, research on mechanisms of change).  At baseline 
and [ADDRESS_918811] participants’ health 
behavior s and cardiovascular health, including their mental health, psychosocial stress, mental 
bandwidth, and time preferences .  
 
Aim 3: Conduct in- depth qualitative interviews with research participants to better 
understand intervention effects and mechanisms and experiences with the study. Our 
primary outcomes will be a series of themes related to participants’ experience as a part of a 
guaranteed basic income study and perceptions of how the study did or did not help support their 
physical and mental health.  
 
 
3. Background  
Health behaviors are major, modifiable risk factors for the development and progression of chronic 
diseases, which account for a large proportion of all deaths in the US and contribute to disparities 
in premature mortality based on both income and race.1 There is substantial evidence, for 
example, that behaviors like smoking, physical activity, and diet are associated with an increased 
risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), as are modifiable factors such as blood pressure, 
cholesterol, body mass index, and  fasting glucose.2,[ADDRESS_918812] had considerable success – e.g., tobacco policies like taxes and clean 
indoor air laws – many adults remain at high risk for CVD and large racial and economic disparities 
in chronic disease risk continue to persist. This is in part because few policies have addressed 
poverty as a fundamental driver of health.  
 
A growing body of research suggests that poverty affects human behavior through 
financial and psychological mechanisms.  In addition to the readily apparent economic 
pathways by [CONTACT_679291]’s engagement in health- promoting behaviors (e.g., 
inability to access or afford healthy food or  preventive health services), recent studies indicate 
that poverty also has negative psychological consequences.[ADDRESS_918813] rigorously examined the effects of poverty on health behaviors and the mechanisms 
by [CONTACT_679292]. Determining the impac t of poverty 
alleviation interventions on health behaviors and CVD risk –  and the channels through which 
these effects operate –  will fill important scientific and policy gaps.  
 
Guaranteed income programs that provide recurring monthly payments of $[ADDRESS_918814] cash transfers has also 
been adopted at the national level (e.g., direct payments in American Rescue Plan).  While 
emerging evidence suggests that cash transfers improve socio- economic outcomes, there are 
significant evidence gaps as to whether they also improve health behaviors , reduce chronic 
disease risk factors , and lessen socio -economic disparities in ch ronic disease risk. The project 
activities will include developi[INVESTIGATOR_679285] (Stage 1) as well as  
basic science analysis of mechanisms of change (Stage 0). Findings from the project will provide 
suggestive evidence of whether bold economic interventions that address the economic and psychological consequences of poverty have the potential to promote health behavior. If

Pi[INVESTIGATOR_679282]: 08.08.[ADDRESS_918818] of potentially eligible participants will then be generated by [CONTACT_679293] (PI, UPHS Physician who has completed SlicerDicer research training through Penn KnowledgeLink) 
through the electronic medical record based on the inclusion criteria using EPIC’s SlicerDicer tool. 
These potentially eligible participants will be routed from SlicerDicer to an EPIC Report for access 
to identifiable information after entering the IRB -approved protocol number.  
•  The list of variables that will be pulled include:  
o MRN 
o Patient name  
o DOB  
o Age 
o Sex 
o PCP 
o Pt Portal Status

o Next PCP visit 
o Payor  
o Patient Type  
o Active FYIs  
o PCP Department  
o Zip Code 
o Rsch.Cntct.Pref  
o Phone 
Study staff will not have any involvement in the clinical care of potential participants.  Recruitment 
will be done using a batched approach starting with 1) MyPennMedicine messages, followed by 
2) Text messages, and finally 3) QR Codes in the clinic. Potentially eligible patients will first be 
contact[CONTACT_283787] a MyPennMedicine message with a REDCap survey link to our study interest 
form.  For participants who respond to the survey interest form, the variables phone, patient name, 
DOB, and last visit date will be added to our REDCap project .  Participants that do not complete 
an interest form via MyPennMedicine will be sent a text asking if they’d like to complete the online 
interest form via text, or if they would like to receive a call by [CONTACT_679294].   Research staff will follow- up with a phone call for those who not 
complete the interest form via text and  ask if they’d like to complete the interest form over the 
phone. Research staff will be able to confirm the participant’s identity  over the phone by [CONTACT_679295]. Survey interest forms w ill be matched with the eligible EHR list pulled from 
SlicerDicer to confirm eligibility. Eligible participants will be contact[CONTACT_679296]. Study staff will describe the intervention and 
inform potential participants that the cash transfers may lead to SSI slightly overpaying them and 
asking for money back, which they can ask SSA to waive. Participants will also be informed that 
our team has received a notice from the state of Pennsylvania that the study payments will not 
count as income for state programs such as SNAP, TANF, and Medicaid, so their eligibility for 
these programs will not be affected by [CONTACT_160024]. Eligible and interested potential 
participants will then be scheduled for an in- person baseline visit with study staff, where informed 
 
7 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_679282]: 08.08.2023  consent will be obtained (see consent procedures, below, for additional details). The in- person 
visits will take place at [ADDRESS_918819] at the Psychology of Eating and Consumer Health Lab 
at the University of Pennsylvania (PI: [INVESTIGATOR_679286]).  
Written c onsent will be obtained from participants during the initial in- person visit, prior to the 
study session.  A single consent will be used for all study activities except the qualitative 
interviews, which will involve a separate consent process.   The following data will be collected 
during the baseline assessment:  
• Survey data – Study staff will administer an in -person REDCap survey that will capture 
the following:  
o Sociodemographics including age, sex, gender, address of residence, zipcode,race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, marital status, schooling attainment

participants to press a button when a stimulus appears on a screen and 
measuring reaction time and accuracy  
 For this computer -based task, no identifying information is entered, and 
immediately upon completion the program puts out the relevant data (e.g. 
reaction time, accuracy), which will be directly and immediately entered into 
REDCap by [CONTACT_464]  
• W9 and C2 
o W9 (including SSN) and C2 will be collected for all participants . These will be 
completed by [CONTACT_679298] a secure location only accessible by [CONTACT_3449] 
 
8 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_679282]: 08.08.2023  personnel .  At the end of the study, W9 forms will be scanned and sent via 
SecureShare to Sarah Boyer to be logged into the Greenphire W -9 Database.  
Once scanned, paper copi[INVESTIGATOR_405249].    
At the end of the baseline assessment, participants will be randomized using a permuted block 
technique with block size of 4 to either usual care (Arm 1) or to the unconditional cash transfer 
intervention (Arm 2). Participants in Arm 2 will receive an unconditional cash transfer of $[ADDRESS_918821], for a total of $1000. In addition,  [ADDRESS_918822], all participants will receive $25 compensation for completing the baseline assessment, and $50 for completing the follow -up assessment. Participants providing at -home 
blood pressure readings will receive an additional $3 per reading (maximum $3 per week, $48 
total).  
 Qualitative interview procedures:  During the 3- month study visit, up to 35  interested study 
participants (25 intervention, 10 control) will be selected  to participate in a follow up qualitative 
interview to better understand their experience in the study, including the mechanisms by [CONTACT_679299] (see attached in- depth interview guide s). 
Participant interest will be obtained during the baseline visit and documented in a secure REDCap 
database. Once participant interest is confirmed, research staff will randomly select [ADDRESS_918823] time to review prior to the interview.  Once interview appointments are 
scheduled, participants will receive a reminder text the week prior and the day before their 
interview to remind them about the time/date of their interview.  
The qualitative research interviewer will call the research participants at the phone number that 
they provide our research team  in REDCap . Prior to conducting the qualitative interviews, the 
research interviewer will run participants through a verbal consent process (a copy of the verbal 
consent script has been attached to this submission). Verbal consent will be documented in a 
secure REDC ap database.  
The research interviewer will then conduct an audio- recorded qualitative interview with research 
participants using the Guaranteed Income Control and Intervention Interview Guide (attached to 
this submission). Upon completion of the interviews, the qualitative interviewer will transcribe the 
interviews and upload transcription notes to a secure data server.  The digitally recorded

compensated $[ADDRESS_918825] at 
the Psychology of Eating and Consumer Health Lab at the University of Pennsylvania (PI: [INVESTIGATOR_679286]).   
There will be no subject follow -up after the 3 -month study visit and qualitative interview.  
5.2. Consent  
Randomized- controlled trial consent: Consent will be obtained from participants during the initial 
in-person visit, prior to the study session. A single consent will be used for all study activities 
except the qualitative interviews, which will involve a s eparate consent process. Assent will be 
confirmed prior to the follow up session. Participants will be provided a copy of the consent form, 
which will then be reviewed with the participant by [CONTACT_464], and will only proceed with the study 
if they agree to consent. The consent form will be in English and will clearly state the purpose, 
eligibility criteria, study procedures, potential risks and benefits of participation, and the subject’s 
right to refuse to participate or withdraw from the study. In parti cular, potential participants will be 
informed about the small impact on SSI benefits. We will provide information in the informed 
consent and welcome packet explaining that study payments are not considered countable 
income for the following list of gover nment assistance programs, as well as information about how 
to report the income to ensure it does not affect eligibility:  
• Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF),  
• Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) Medical Assistance (MA)  
• non-MAGI MA including Home and Community -Based Services  
categories,  
• Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP),  
• Low-Income Household Water Assistance Program (LIHWAP),  
• Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP).  
It will be emphasized that participation in the study will not affect the right to care or services to which the potential participant would otherwise be entitled. It will be emphasized that only a subset 
of participants will be interviewed. Written consent will then be obtained and documented in 
REDCap.  
Qualitative interview consent: Prior to conducting the interview, the interviewer will speak with 
participants on the phone and explain to participants that their participation is voluntary (see attached verbal consent script). The interviewer will also go over confidentiality and privacy with 
the participants. Participants will be informed that they can discontinue their participation at any time. The interviewer will answer any questions the participant has. Should the participant choose 
to participate in the study, the interviewer will document that they obtained verbal consent in 
REDCap.  
6. Subject Compensation  
All subject compensation will be through ClinCard.  
 
10 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_679282]: 08.08.2023  All participants will receive $25 compensation for completing the baseline assessment, $50 for 
completing the follow -up assessment. Participants providing at -home blood pressure readings will 
also receive $3 per reading (maximum  $3 per week,  $48 total). Participants completing the in-
depth interview will receive an additional $35.  
Participants in the intervention arm will also receive $125 after completion of the baseline 
assessment, and an additional $125 every 2 weeks for 8 total payments ($1000 total).  
7. Analysis Plan  
AIMS 1 & 2: Data will be descriptively summarized and evaluated for quality prior to analysis. 
Means and standard deviations will be used to characterize continuous variables such as weight 
and blood pressure, and frequencies and percentages will be used t o describe categorical 
variables. Medians and interquartile ranges will be reported for continuous variables that exhibit 
skewness. Data will be descriptively summarized overall and by [CONTACT_3004].  
 
All outcomes will be analyzed at the participant level. Analyses will employ population- averaged 
marginal models estimated by [CONTACT_33747] (GEE) to account for correlations among the within- person baseline and follow -up measurements. Marginal models 
estimated by [CONTACT_230390]- level interpretation and robustness of 
estimated effects to the assumed correlation structure among repeated measurements (meaning 
unbiased estimates of the effect of the behavioral inter vention will be obtained whether or not the 
correlation among repeated measurements within a participant is modeled correctly). Clusters will 
be defined at the level of the participant for all analyses, and independence working correlation 
will be assumed.  Linear models will be used for continuous outcomes and logistic models for 
categorical or ordinal outcomes.  
 Models will include intervention, measurement timepoint, and the interaction of intervention and 
measurement timepoint as  categorical variables. The primary analysis testing the effectiveness 
of the cash transfers compared to the control arm will be evaluated by [CONTACT_679300]- measurement timepoint interaction coefficient is 0, denoting no 
difference in the change in respective outcomes from baseline to month [ADDRESS_918826] for baseline covariates that differ significantly 
at the 0.05 level by [CONTACT_3004]. We will evaluate sensitivity to missing data by [CONTACT_679301]. The Holm procedure at a family -wise error rate of 0.05 
will be used to account for multiple comparisons in testing differences in 9 primary outcomes 
between the two groups (number of ED visits, number of non -ED visits, medication adheren ce, 
smoking, alcohol use, food security, utility security, health expenditures, and financial stress).  
 
 
Aim 3 –  Qualitative interviews: Qualitative analyses will be guided by [CONTACT_679302] a priori attributes of interest and identification of emergent codes and 
themes. A comprehensive coding scheme will be developed and applied to all data to produce a 
fine-grained descriptive analysis. All transcribed interview data will be imported into Nvivo for 
thematic coding. A single analyst will review and code all transcripts. The analysis will yield an understanding of any un anticipated or anticipated consequences of the study and cash transfer 
provision while also elucidating pathways through which cash transfers influence health behavior.

Not applicable. We are only enrolling subjects [ADDRESS_918833] staff adhere to the 
IRB regulations and policies including processes for: (1) obtaining informed consent; (2) informing participants how to contact [CONTACT_978], study coordinator, or IRB office with questions and/or concerns; 
(3) strictly  adhering to a participant’s right to withdraw from the study or decline to answer 
questions; (4) maintaining participant confidentiality and data de -identification processes; (5) 
securely storing data; (6) submitting any amendments to the IRB for approval  prior to 
implementing changes to the protocol; and (7) monitoring and reporting adverse events.  
9.6 Risk/Benefit  
 
9.6.[ADDRESS_918834] patient care or medical decision making, we 
consider this study minimal risk. The primary risk is  a breach of confidentiality . This risk has been 
mitigated by [CONTACT_679303], a highly secure data storage system, and a plan to remove identifiers from the data wherever possible. In addition, all personnel will be held 
to high standards of upholding confidentiality and safeguarding patient privacy.  
In addition, for participants receiving the intervention there is the risk that the Social Security 
Administration (SSA) may decide that participants receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI) 
benefits have been slightly overpaid during the four months of the study.  SSA may ask them to 
return the overpayment, but should not (by [CONTACT_1029]) affect their eligibility for SSI Benefits. 
Participants may ask SSA to waive recovery of the overpaid money by [CONTACT_679304]. Our team ha s received correspondence (attached to application) from the state of 
Pennsylvania confirming that s tudy payments are not considered countable income for the 
following government programs, and therefore will be no loss to these benefits:  
• Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF),  
• Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) Medical Assistance (MA),

Pi[INVESTIGATOR_679282]: 08.08.2023  • non-MAGI MA including Home and Community -Based Services  
categories,  
• Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP),  
• Low-Income Household Water Assistance Program (LIHWAP), and  
• Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP).  
 Low-income individuals will address their experiences with poverty and receipt of short -term cash 
transfers. These can be sensitive topi[INVESTIGATOR_679288].  These participants 
will be offered a referral list for social services resources designed to provide financial support.

diseases.  
 
9.6.3 Alternatives to Participation  
Patients are free not to participate in this study and non- participation will result in  no change in 
the usual care received from their health care providers . 
 
9.6.4 Risk/ Benefit Assessment  
Because this study does not pose more than minimal risk for study participants, we believe the 
benefits of this study outweigh the risks involved.

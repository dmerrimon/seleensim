3. Abstract/Brief Overview:  
Polytrauma patients with rib fractures are at risk for poor pain control resulting in 
adverse pulmonary outcomes, including the development of pneumonia or 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399]. Liposo mal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_172644] a novel medication and 
administration route that may prevent the need for rescue intubation and 
development of pneumonia, avoid epi[INVESTIGATOR_14001], and improve overall patient 
satisfaction and pain control.  This study plans to enroll ad ult, polytrauma 
patients with blunt chest wall trauma resulting in rib and/or sternal fractures to 
receive either liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_172645] (including intravenous, oral, or e pi[INVESTIGATOR_172646]).  Patients will be excluded if they have a known allergy to bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319], 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_172647] [ADDRESS_202170] trauma, minimizing adverse outcomes and length 
of stay and overall narcotic use. The primary outcome of this study is to compare 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_172648].  Secondary outcomes include comp arison 
of clinical outcomes and treatment failures (e.g., development of pneumonia; 
median patient analgesic score by [CONTACT_172708] [NRS]; median 
time to first breakthrough opi[INVESTIGATOR_40533]; incentive spi[INVESTIGATOR_14007] [IS] ability; intensive 
care unit  [ICU] length of stay [LOS]; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_95156]; use of additional analgesia 
adjuncts) and to perform a cost effective analysis.    
 
4. Purpose of Study:  
The primary purpose of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_172649]/or sternal fractures.  Pain scores  will be evaluated using the NRS  
(Appendix). Uncontrolled analgesia following rib fractures can result in intubation, 
pneumonia, prolonged length of stay, and death. Achieving adequate pain control 
in native airway patients prevents clinical challenges. Multimodal analgesia 
regimens are necessary to optimize patient outcomes and prevent untoward 
 
Version date: October 24, [ADDRESS_202171] of care may lead to 
improved analgesia with fewer adverse effects.  Specific aims include to 1) 
compare opi[INVESTIGATOR_4965] (in morphine equivalents ) between patients with 
blunt chest wall trauma and rib and/or sternal fractures receiving liposomal 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_172650]; 2) compare clinical outcomes and 
treatment failures including development of pneumonia, median patient analgesia 
score  using verbal NRS, median time to first breakthrough opi[INVESTIGATOR_40533], IS ability, 
ICU LOS, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_95156], and use of additional analgesic adjuncts; 4) and to 
perform a cost -effectiveness analysis

Background and Significance  
Blunt chest wall trauma  remains the second most common injury observed in 
non-intentional injury -related death in the U.S.A. and accounts for 10% of 
trauma -related emergency department visits worldwide.1-[ADDRESS_202172]

Version date: October 24, 201 6 Page 5 of 27 
 emergency medicine and surger y practitioners are familiar  with intercostal blocks 
for placement of tube thoracostomy. Intercostal blocks do not require additional 
training, as would be done in the setting of a pain medicine fellowship, and do not 
incur the risks of hypotension associated with epi[INVESTIGATOR_44176].  Additionally, 
intercostal and paravertebral blocks carry similar risks of pneumothorax or 
intercostal neurovascular bundle injury.  
 
 
Study design:  
This is an investigator -initiated, single -center, prospective, double -blinded, 
placebo -controlled trial  funded by [CONTACT_172709].   Multi -system, 
adult trauma patients greater than or equal to 18 years of age admitted to the 
University of Cincinnati Medical Center (UCMC), an urban American College of 
Surgeons -verified Level 1 trauma center with mor e than 3500 annual trauma 
admissions annually will be identified by [CONTACT_5051]. Patients will be 
screened  and those who meet all inclusion/exclusion  criteria will be  approached 
for informed consent by [CONTACT_172710].    Informed cons ent will 
be obtained prior to enrollment  and any study procedures are done . Patients will 
then receive either receive [ADDRESS_202176] below each 
affected rib or 0.9% sodium chloride peri-intercostal subcutaneous injection (as 
placebo control) via a 25 -G needle.  Goal enrollment is 200 patients with 100 
patients in each group.  Patients included in the study will be followed during 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_172653].  
 
 
6. Research data collection/study procedures:  
Intervention  
Patients will be identified on admission and will be screened by 
[CONTACT_156587]/exclusion criteria.  After informed consent is obtained they will be 
randomized into one of two possible groups:  
a. Liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_172654]  (group 1; interventional)  
b. 0.9% sod ium chloride  peri-intercostal subcutaneous  (group 2; placebo -
control)   
Patients will be placed on continuous monitoring of heart rate, EKG, and pulse 
oximetry. Blood pressure and respi[INVESTIGATOR_13521] y rate will be measured every [ADDRESS_202177] hour after 
the procedure. All patients undergoing injection will remain on heart rate, EKG, 
and pulse oximetry monitoring by [CONTACT_172711] 96 hours following injection.  
 
In addition,  while in the ICU all study subjects will monitored with a non -invasive 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_172655] (Expi[CONTACT_119980]) to determine respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], tidal volume, minute 
volume and breathing pattern  for up to 96 hours.  This monitoring will aid in 
 
Version date: October 24, [ADDRESS_202178] expansion by [CONTACT_172712].  
 
Supplemental oxygen will be provided to maintain a peripheral oxygen saturation 
of 90% or greater.  
 
Injections will be per formed by [CONTACT_172713] / critical care physicians. Training 
prior to initiating the study will include familiarization with the standardized 
procedure as described below, which will be documented in study records. 
Patients will be monitored by [CONTACT_172714], during, and after the block 
procedure.  Standard inpatient cardiac arrest carts will be immediately available 
before, during, and after the block procedure.  
 
A 20-mL vial will be obtain ed from IDS Pharmacy that either contains liposomal 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_110762] (266 mg in 20 -mL) or 0.9% sodium chloride.  Patients will be 
positioned either sitting up or in logroll/decubitus position. Rib fractures will be 
noted from previously obtained CT scan of the chest from initial trauma 
evaluation. The thoracic postero lateral  area will be prepped and draped in sterile 
fashion. After aspi[INVESTIGATOR_172656], [ADDRESS_202179] below each affected rib by 
[CONTACT_172715] a posterior but not paravertebral position  
or 0.9% saline (as placebo control) will be injected with a [ADDRESS_202180] xray will be obtained as clinically indicated following the  procedure if 
there is concern for the develop ment of pneumothorax . 
 
Self-reported pain will be measured using the verbal NRS, a 0 -10 ordinal scale 
(e.g., 0 = “no pain”; 10 = “worst pain imaginable”).27 Breakthrough opi[INVESTIGATOR_172657]: October 24, [ADDRESS_202181] of care for the appropriate setting (e.g., 
intensive care unit, trauma ward) for the first [ADDRESS_202182] inspi[INVESTIGATOR_72788] (e.g., EzPAP) applied per  our institutional volume expansion protocol.  
 
Follow -up will occur daily by [CONTACT_172716] [ADDRESS_202183] of care analgesia regimen on the trauma service will be provided to all 
patients enrolled in the study, regardless of liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_172658]. This regimen will be per the Trauma acute multimod ality pain 
management protocol (Appendix).  
Typi[INVESTIGATOR_172659], as deemed 
medically a ppropriate  based on age and comorbid medical conditions, includes  
(in order of addition to regimen) : 
• Acetaminophen, oral or enter al 
• NSAIDs, ibuprofen or ketorolac  
• Lidocaine 5% transdermal patch  
• Oral or enteral tramadol  
• Oral or enteral hydrocodone or oxycodone  
• IV morphine or hydromorphone, intermittent dosing  
• Patient controlled analgesia morphine or hydromorphone  
• Long -acting narcotic s, including methadone, oxycodone ER, or morphine 
ER 
• Neuromodulating adjuncts, including gabapentin or pregabalin  
• Epi[INVESTIGATOR_172660].  Subjects who experience 
serious adverse events will be followed until the event resolves.  If necessary 
these patients will be followed up by [CONTACT_172717] -discharge.   
 
Randomization  
Following informed consent, patients  will undergo 2x1 block randomization to 
ensure equal allocation to each intervention group.  Randomization will be 
performed by [CONTACT_172718].

Schedule of subject identification and data collection  
Subjects will be identified based on inclusion criteria at the time of admission to 
the trauma service following evaluation in the emergency departm ent. Subjects 
meeting inclusion criteria will be enrolled within [ADDRESS_202184].  
 
7. Specimen collection:  
No serum assays are necessary for this study and will not be collected.  
 
8. Potential Benefits:  
Blunt chest wall trauma remains a common injury seen in non -intentional injury -
related deaths.  It accounts for nearly 10% of trauma -related emergency 
department visits worldwide and is associated with high morbidity and mortality.  
This morbidity and mortality are influenced by [CONTACT_172720] .  
Uncontrolled analgesia following rib fractures can result in intubation, pneumonia, 
prolonged length of stay, and death. Achieving adequate pain control in native 
airway patients prevents clinical challenges. Multimodal analgesia regimens are 
necessary to optimize patient outcomes and prevent untoward effects of opi[INVESTIGATOR_172664] (e.g., hypotension; bradycardia; central nervous system depression; 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341]).  
 
Liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_172665] 96 hours.  It has been shown to improve analgesia 
scores and decrease opi[INVESTIGATOR_172666] (Figure 1a).  It has also been 
shown to reduce the time to fir st opi[INVESTIGATOR_172667] (Figure 1b).  Reductions in

 In addition, all subjects will be monitored with a non -invasive respi[INVESTIGATOR_172655] 
(Expi[CONTACT_119980]) to determine respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], tidal volume, minute volume and 
breathing pattern.  This monitoring is in addition to standard care and will aid in 
detection of  respi[INVESTIGATOR_172670].   
 
 
Future patients can benefit from the cultivation of this knowledge to have both 
potential patient benefit (e.g., decreased morbidity and mortality; improved pain 
scores; decreased risk of pneumonia) and cost -savings (e.g., decreased 
medication requirement;  less time in the ICU or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]). Overall, optimal use of 
liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_172671], pulmonary toilet 
and ability to use IS, and decrease the need for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2538].  Improved patient 
outcomes, expansion of scientific kn owledge, and development of new blunt 
chest wall trauma pain protocols may result.

of the intercostal rib block administration and the reaction is severe or life 
threatening, then the patient will be withdrawn from the study and no further 
injections will be administered, regardless of how many injections were originally 
planned. In addition, an adverse event based on physiologic response will 
include a sustained (greater than  five minute) change in heart rate by > 4 0% from 
baseline or absolute heart rate greater than 160 or less than 50, change in 
systolic blood pressure by 40% or absolute systolic blood pressure less than 80 
mmHg or greater than 180 mmHg, change in respi[INVESTIGATOR_172675] 50% or absolute 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_172676] 30 or less than 6, or decreasing oxygen saturation

segment changes seen on the EKG monitoring strip will lead to immediate 
subject discontinuation . 
 
Safety Assessments  
 
Every adverse event, whether or not thought to be related to study drug,  will be 
recorded and entered into the RAVE Case Report Form  database.   
 
Any medical condition present prior to study enrollment should not be reported as an 
adverse event, unless the medical condition worsens in severity or seriousness during 
the study.  In this case it may be reported as an adverse event at the discretion of the 
Investigator.  
 
The Investigator will review each event and assess its severity and relationship to the 
study treatment.   
 
Adverse event Definitions:  
 
Adverse Event  
Adverse event means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a 
drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related.  
An adverse event (also referred to as an adverse experience) can be any unfavorable 
and unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal labo ratory finding), symptom, or disease 
temporally associated with the use of a drug, and does not imply any judgment about 
causality. An adverse event can arise with any use of the drug (e.g., off -label use, use in 
combination with another drug) and with any  route of administration, formulation, or 
dose, including an overdose.  
 
Suspected Adverse Reaction   
Suspected adverse reaction means any adverse event for which there is a reasonable 
possibility that the drug caused the adverse event. For the purposes of I ND safety 
reporting, ‘reasonable possibility’ means there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the drug and the adverse event. A suspected adverse reaction 
implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which me ans 
any adverse event caused by a drug.  
 
Adverse Reaction  
An adverse reaction means any adverse event caused by a drug. Adverse reactions are 
a subset of all suspected adverse reactions where there is reason to conclude that the 
drug caused the event.  
 
 
Version date: October 24, 201 6 Page 13 of 27 
 Unexpected   
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not 
listed in the investigator brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has 
been observed; or, if an investigator brochure is not required or a vailable, is not 
consistent with the risk information described in the general investigational plan or 
elsewhere in the current application, as amended.  
 
Serious  
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of 
either the investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: Death, a 
life-threatening adverse event, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_172677], a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important 
medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, o r require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
 
Life-Threatening  
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “life -threatening” if, in the 
view of either the investigator or sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or subject at 
immediate risk of death. It does not include an adverse even t or suspected adverse 
reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.

nominal data will be performed using the Fisher’s exact test or chi square test as 
required based on sample size. Continuou s data will be compared using 
student’s t -test/ANOVA or rank sum/Kruskal -Wallis ANOVA for normally 
distributed and non -normally distributed data, respectively as appropriate. A p -
value < 0.[ADDRESS_202189]-effectiveness analysis will be pulled from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_172695].  
 
Given the pi[INVESTIGATOR_109248], a total of 200 patients will be enrolled. 
Assuming a 96 -hour requirement of 250 -mg oral morphine equivalents 
(approximately 12.5 -mg IV hydromorphone), we anticipate a 20% reduction to 
200-mg oral morphine equivalents (approximately 10 -mg IV hydromorphone) 
resulting in an expected difference in means of [ADDRESS_202190] deviation of 50 mg. To achieve an 80% power with an  alpha of 0.05 for 
this primary outcome, the goal enrollment is 200 patients.  
 
12. Data storage and confidentiality (include sample storage if applicable)  
This project will use Medidata Rave® as its Electronic Data Capture (EDC) 
software, which is a robust EDC platform for capturing, managing and reporting 
clinical research data. This system includes a robust query management system  
based on the Data Quality Plan, which will identify data quality checks to be 
programmed into the database design. Frequent monitoring of the database 
throughout the study will allow for corrective action to be taken quickly if 
problems are identified wit h the data collection process.  The database will be 
password protected and appropriately secured such that only authorized study 
personnel will have access to the data.  Data will be maintained in a confidential 
manner with regular reminders of the need f or confidentiality provided from the 
senior investigator. A single subject log will be kept by [CONTACT_172724], initials, medical record number, and 
admission date (attached). Once assigned to the log, patients  will only be 
evaluated using their de -identified, study number.  Data entered into the 
electronic database will be de -identified.  
 
Once the study has been completed, the subject log will be destroyed and only 
the de -identified electronic database will be kept.  Only study personnel will have 
access to the data.  
 
13. Study Population  
UCMC is an urban, academic American College of Surgeons -verified Level 1 
trauma center that treats over 3500 trauma patients each year.  Patients 
admitted to the UCMC trauma serv ice are eligible for enrollment. Patients will be 
screened on admission or identified per the daily trauma census. Trauma team 
 
Version date: October 24, [ADDRESS_202191] study personnel daily once a patient is identified as 
a potential candidate. Study personnel will scr een subjects for inclusion and 
exclusion. If patient meets inclusion criteria, then consent will be administered by 
[CONTACT_3462] (see section 14).  
 
Inclusion Criteria  
a. Patients with an anticipated length of stay of at least 72 hours  
b. Trauma patients with two or more rib or sternal fractures  
c. Patients demonstrating the inability to achieve greater than 50% predicted 
inspi[INVESTIGATOR_172696] 24 
hours of admission (Appendix)

Patients will be followed for outcome assessment during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_172697].  
 
14. Consenting process and plan  
Patients will be identified as previously described and permission to consent per 
the trauma team attending will be obtained prior to administration of consent. 
Study personnel will administer consent in the patient’s room. Patients who meet 
inclusion and exclusion criteria will be eligible for consent.  Informed consent will 
be obtained prior to randomization into treatment arms.  Patients unable to give 
consent will have LAR or next of kin consented. LAR must show proof of health 
care POA or court documen t. A copy of the documents will be kept with the 
 
Version date: October 24, [ADDRESS_202193]. Next of kin will be determined by [CONTACT_172725]’ note. 
The order in which the next of kin may act as LAR is : spouse, parent, adult son 
or daughter, adult brother or sister. If next of kin available at the time of consent 
cannot agree, the person cannot participate in the research.  Investigators will be 
available seven days a week and will continue corresponden ce with subjects 
throughout the study for up to [ADDRESS_202194] of care.  
 
15. Compensation:  
Patients will not receive any compensation for research involvement.  
 
16. Subject cos ts:  
There are no additional costs to subjects.  
 
In case of injury or illness related to the study, the University of Cincinnati 
Medical Center will provide emergency medical care at no cost to the subject.  
The University of Cincinnati will review each case and determine on a case by

definition  An adverse drug reaction (ADR ) in this study is defined as any 
adverse event (AE ) suspected by [CONTACT_11219]/or the 
Sponsor to be related to MEN1611 when given in combination with trastuzumab ± fulvestrant. Toxicities will be  
graded according to 
the National Cancer Institute Common Terminolo gy Criteria for 
Adverse Events versio n 4.03 (NCI CTCAE v4.03), except for 
segmental wall -motion abnormalities (not described in NCI 
CTCAE v4.03). 
A DLT is defined as any of the following ADRs related to the 
combination regimens or to MEN1611 alone and unrelated to the 
subject s’ underlying dis ease or concomitant me dication occurring 
during the DLT assessment period of 28 days : 
• Any grade 3 (lasting >7 days) or grade  4 increase in 
aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP). In subjects with hepatic 
metastases, AST or ALT >8x ULN or AST or ALT >5x ULN for ≥[ADDRESS_1120171], ALT,  or ALP level s at baseline, an elevation 
to ≥ 10 ×  upper limit of normal ( ULN ) is considered a DLT.   
• Any grade 3 (lasting >7 days) , or grade 4 if asymptomatic , 
increase in  amylase and/or lipase.

Study Duration  The overall study duration will depend on the completion  of the 
escalating dose levels/cohorts , the number of subject s to be treated  
per each dose-cohort, the completion of the expansion cohort up to 
a total of [ADDRESS_1120175]’s response.  
All subject s pre -screened for the PIK3CA mu tation will undergo a 
maximum 4 -week Screening Period.  
Individual study duration will depend on the duration of the study 
treatment which continues up to disease progression or study 
discontinuation for other reasons.  
The End of Study Visit will be performed 4  weeks (± 7 days) after 
the last dose of M EN1611 or at the time of Study W ithdrawal . 
Unscheduled assessments showing disease progression and leading 
to subject’s withdrawal can replace the End of Study Visit provided 
that all assessment/procedures scheduled for this visit are 
completed.  
After perm anent withdrawal of the study treatment , subjects will be 
allocated to any other standard treatment as per the Investigator 
judgement.  
Survival Follow- up: 
After the End of Study Visit, all subjects evaluable for efficacy will 
be followed for survival status according to local practice (a visit or a telephone call) every 12 weeks ± 7 days up to the End of Study.  
End of Study : 
The study  will end with the End of Study Visit of the last subject 
who discontinues the study treatment . For safety monitoring, all 
serious adverse events (SAEs) with a suspected causal relationship 
to the study treatment that occur after End of Study must be 
recorded and notified to the Sponsor  as reported in section 8.6.2.

Subjects with HER2 positive a/m breast cancer  will be eligible for 
pre-screening if they  have progressed to at least one line of 
trastuzumab -based regimen in the a/m setting and: 
• are on an ongoing second line of t reatment or 
• have received at least [ADDRESS_1120189] recent archived FFPE tissue  and 
in plasma  samples  (for ctDNA sequencing , centrally analysed ) . 
Eligibility to the study will be done based on PIK3CA mutations 
detected  in FFPE tissue  only.  
Note:  In case no archived tissue sample is available, a new biopsy 
of the primary tumour or a metastasis should be obtained only upon 
subject  consent, and based on the investigator ’s judgment that there 
is no additional risk to the subject ’s safety. The samples will be 
centrally analysed using validated Cobas® PIK3CA Mutation Test. 
Screening Period (Day -27 To Day - 1): 
During the  [ADDRESS_1120190] will 
be screened for eligibility.  
The following procedures will be performed  at Screening : 
• Check of inclusion/exclusion criteria . 
• Recording of demographic data.  
• Standard medical, surgical and medication history. 
• Smoking history and current status. 
• Verification  of pre - or postmenopausal status in 
HR-positive women . 
• Physical exam ination  including vital signs (i.e., blood 
pressure [ BP], heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] , body 
temperature), height and weight.

5.11.11  Future Research  
Upon CA/EC approvals received, with subject s' optional and additional consent, the Sponsor and/or 
the Site may use the data collected during the course of the study for further medical and scientific research purposes. These may include, for example: retrospective clinical studies; clinical studies pertaining to the subjects’ pathology/medical condition(s) or similar conditions; studies which 
compare the data of this study with those from other sources to identify the factors involved in a disease; registration of new drugs.  
In the context of these add itional research activities, subjects’ data will be processed, pseudonymised 
and transferred abroad and may be shared with future research partners  –in most cases this will 
prevent subject  identification; however, in the unlikely event subject s’ full ident ity really needs to  be 
disclosed, the same precautions and safeguards as those described in this protocol will be  
implemented.  
 
Clinical Study Protocol 
EudraCT No.: 2017-004631-[ADDRESS_1120255] incidence among all cancers worldwide, with 1.7 million new cases 
recorded in 2012, accounting for 12% of all new cancer diagnoses. It is also the fifth highest cause of 
cancer -related death, with a mortality of 23.1/100.000 ( 1, 2). Advanced breast cancer (ABC ) 
comprises both locally advanced and metastatic breast cancer (MBC) ( 3). Although treatable, MBC  
remains an incurable disease with a 5-year survival of only 25% ( 4, 5, and 6). Only recent data seem 
to indicate an improvement in median overall survival (OS) ( 7). 
Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease family comprising a number o f subtypes. Biologically it is 
classified based on the expression of the oestrogen  receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PgR) and 
human epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] -2 (HER -2). Thus, it is possible to identify [ADDRESS_1120256] 
molecular subty pes: luminal A, luminal B (HER2 -negative), luminal B (HER2 -positive ), 
HER2 -positive and triple negative subtypes; each subtypes are linked to specific therapeutic 
indications. HER2 -positive (HER2+) breast cancer represents 15% to 30% of all breast cancers and it is associated 
with aggressive behaviour and poor prognosis ( 8). E ven if the use of the anti-HER2 antibody  
trastuzumab has led to important clinical benefits in this setting, 50% to 74% of subject s with 
metastatic disease do not respond to treatment ( 9, 10) and approximately 75% progress within a year 
(10). Beyond trastuzumab, new therapeutic options ( trastuzumab emtansine [ trastuzumab -DM1 , 
T-DM1 ], lapatinib, pertuzumab) have provided important clinical benefits in terms of OS, but disease 
progression on HER2- directed therapy is experienced by [CONTACT_810124] s, thus new strategies are 
needed.  
Among the subtypes, hormone receptor  (HR) -positive tumours are the most common, as at least 80% 
of breast cancer express ER and PgR. Anti -estrogen therapi[INVESTIGATOR_22920] a mainstay for this setting of 
subject s, antagonizing estrogen ligand binding to ER (tamoxifen and other selective ER-modulators ), 
inhibiting dimerisation  and down- regulating ER (fulvestrant and other selective estrogen receptor 
downregulators ) or blocking oestrogen  production (aromatase inhibitors; letrozole, anastrozole, 
exemestane). Unfortunatel y, not all of these tumours are truly sensitive to manipulation of the ER 
pathwa y, with approximately 20% of HR -positive MBC proving refract ory to first -line endocrine 
therapy. Thus, the emergence of resistance to endocrine therapy is inevitable with advanced breast cancer as a clinical benefit rate declines from approximately 70% for first -line fulvestrant or 
aromatase inhibitors to around 30% for second or greater lines of therapy ( 11).

The study rationale comes from the evidence that a large body of experimental and clinical data 
suggests that hyper activation  of the phosphatidylinositol 3- kinase (PI3K) pathway, the most 
frequently mutated pathway in breast cancer, plays a major role in promoting resistance both in 
HER2 -positive and in HR -positive breast cancer ( 12); its frequency has been identi fied in 
approximately 35% of HR-positive and approximately 25% to 30% of HER2 positive breast cancers 
(13, 14).  
Similar to other PI3K inhibitors given in combination with trastuzumab ( 15), the inhibition of PI3K 
signalling pathway in subjects with PIK3CA  mutated HER2 positive locally recurrent unresectable 
(advanced) or metastatic (a/m) breast cancer progressed to anti - HER2 based therapy will be 
evaluated in tumor biopsy (target tissue - when available) as well as in normal tissues (platelet- rich 
plasma [PRP] and hair follicle) in the present study to:  
• Confirm the dose -dependent target inhibition observed in subjects with advanced solid 
tumours after administration of MEN1611 single-agent.  
• Characterise target engagement following the administration of MEN1611 twice daily (BID) schedule and after repeat dose administration.  
• Generate additional evidences on the relationship between drug exposure, target engagement, tumour effects and PFS/OS in order to identify the optimal biomarker and normal tissue to be used as a surrogate for clinical response.  
Although tumour biopsies are considered to be the gold standard for assessing m olecular changes in 
tissue, the assessment of target modulation in normal tissue (PRP and hair follicle) reduce the risks associated with repeated tumour biopsies and enable serial determinations of drug effects, thus 
minimizing the impact of inter - and intra -subject variability on such results. However , such surrogate 
methods may be hampered by [CONTACT_400221] e.g. drug penetration (and concentrations), ge ne 
expression and signal transduction pathway regulation among different tissues. Therefore it is important to assess multiple pharmacodynamics ( PD) biomarkers in both PRP and hair follicle in 
order to comprehensively evaluate the overall pharmacological effects of the treatment, avoiding the risk of over- interpreting results from a s ingle PD marker evaluation ( 16). 
PRP [ 17, 18, 19 and 20] and hair follicle [ 21] offer a good normal tissue matrix in which to measure 
pharmacodynamic biomarkers of the PI3K/AKT/ mTOR signalling pathway.  
 PI3K  Inhibitor in  Cancer Therapy  
The PI3K  and mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K -mTOR) pathway regulates cell growth, 
proliferation  and metabolism and is a deregulated signalling  pathway in human cancer ( 22). Genetic 
aberrations in this pathway, such a s mutation or amplification of phosphatidylinositol 3- kinase,

catalytic, alpha polypeptide gene (PIK3CA), which encodes the p110α isoform of PI3K  or 
inactivating mutations of phosphatase and tensin homolog ue (PTEN), occur in most epi[INVESTIGATOR_810072] , leading to constitutive hyper activation  of downstream effector kinases such as v-akt murine 
thymoma vir al oncogene homologue (Akt, protein kinase B) and mTOR. The high frequency of P I3K 
pathway alterations in HER2 -positive breast cancer, combined with its role in resistance to 
trastuzumab and preclinical evidence that the PI3K inhibition restores sensitivity to trastuzumab with 
a higher anti-tumour activity than single agent, supports the rationale for clinical evaluation of 
combined targeting of PI3K and HER2 in subject s with HER2 -positive breast cancer. On the other 
hand, activat ing PIK3 CA mutations are often observed in HR -positive breast cancer (about 40% 
activating mutations detected) ( 14) and have been associated with disease progression and endocrine 
therapy resistance; targeting PI3K is therefore a potential therapeutic strategy. Particularly, identification of subject s with PIK3CA mutations who derive benefit from PI3K targeted therapy  
could help to guide treatment decisions ( 23). These data are supported by [CONTACT_810125], as 
PIK3CA mutated breast cancer has a better respon se to treatment than PIK3CA wild type tumours 
(24, 25).

harbouring PIK3CA mutations. The activity of MEN1611, at a clinically relevant dose  of 6.5 mg/Kg, 
in combination with trastuzumab induced even complete responses in the treated mice.  In the Phase I first -in-human  (FIH)  study, [ADDRESS_1120258] been treated with 
MEN1611 at different dose strengths. MEN1611 was well tolerated and the  majority of the study 
treatment -related adverse events ( AEs) were grade  1 or 2, reversible and in line wit h the class of the 
drug (gastrointestinal, hyperglycaemia  and fatigue). The maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) was 
determined to be [ADDRESS_1120259] cancers treated with the 
dual inhibition: PI3K in hibitors with fulvestrant in HR -positi ve disease and PI3K inhibitors with 
trastuzumab in HER2- positive setting ( 15, 24, 25, 26 and  27). 
The preclinical and clinical evidences, as well as the literature data regarding other PI3K inhibitors, 
support the rationale to develop MEN1611 in combination with trastuzumab and with trastuzumab 
plus fulvestrant for the treatment of PIK3CA mutated HER2 -positive locally recurrent, unresectable 
advanced or metastatic (a/m)  breast cancer subject s pre -treated  with at least 2 lines of anti -HER2 
based therapy.  Activating PIK3CA mutations (encoding the p110α isoform of PI3K) are often

oestrogen receptor activation, resulting in synergistic antitumour activity. Thus, dual blockade of PI3K and oestrogen receptor pathways could restore treatment sensitivity and inhibit growth of endocrine therapy -resistant tumours ( 24). At the same, resistance to HER2 -targeted therapy might 
occur as a result of aberrant activation of signaling pathways downstream of the receptor. Because HER2 mediates signal transduction through the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, inhibition of components 
of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway might be a reasonable way to overcome resistance and restore sensitivity to HER2 -targeted therapy. Indeed, preclinical and neoadjuvant tri al data suggest that 
PIK3CA alterations confer resistance to HER2 -targeted therapy and are associated with lower 
pathological complete response (pCR) rate in HER2- positive breast cancer. ( 28). 
The development plan of MEN1611 in combination with trastuzumab and with trastuzumab plus fulvestrant will start with this  Phase Ib study (MEN1611- 01) with the main purpose to identify the 
MTD and select the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of MEN1611. After a classic 3 + [ADDRESS_1120261] s will

postmenopausal women  and MEN1611 with trastuzumab in the HER2-positive,  HR-negative men 
and women, and  HR-positive men and  premenopausal women.. Indeed, safety, tolerability, 
pharmacokinetic ( PK) and PD profiles as well as preliminary clinical a ctivity of those combinations 
will be assessed in niche populations.

 Risk Benefit Assessmen t 
Treatment options for  HER2 -positive, HR -positive metastatic breast cancer progressed over the 
standard treatment still represent a high medical need.  
Hyper activation  of the PI3K pathway represents th e principal mechanism of resistance involved in 
the progression disease of HR -positive, as well as HER2 -positive breast cancer  (29). Therefore a 
number of PI3K inhibitors are under clinical investigation, including pan- PI3K inhibitors targeting 
all four isoforms o f class I PI3K (e.g. buparlisib, pi[INVESTIGATOR_444817] ), as well as i soform- selective inhibitors, 
especially PI3Kα inhibitor, such as taselisib and  alpelisib  (30, 31). Considering the potential high 
level of toxicity of pan -PI3K inhibitors, some of them were discontinued in spi[INVESTIGATOR_810073] ( i.e., buparlisib) ( 24). As far as concerns 
this aspect, the isoform selective inhibitors like MEN1611 showed a better safety profile with a good risk-benefit ratio in the FIH  study conducted by [CONTACT_810126]. 
MEN1611 is a potent, selective class I PI3K inhibitor with a strong inhibitory activity against PI3Kα which has shown a cytotoxic activity in vitro and in vivo models as single agent as in combination. Moreover, in the FIH conducted previously by [CONTACT_810127] i Pharmaceutical , MEN1611 has shown a good 
safety profile, in line with the class of agent , furthermore an encouraging anti-tumor activity, resulting 
in disease stabilization in 24% of treated subject s, has been observed (PA-001 EU Clinical Study 
Report, data on file).  
Therefore, given the  lack of standard therapeutic options for the selected subject  population and the 
pharmacological properties and acceptable toxicological profile shown in preclinical and clinical studies, the risk-benefit assessment is considered favourable in the context of the clinical study. Considering the above, the intent is exploring the safety and activity of MEN1611 plus trastuzumab not only in HER2-positive/ HR-nega tive breast cancer , but also in hormone -sensitive disease adding

fulvestrant to the double combination. If this  study demonstrates efficacy signal, MEN1611 could 
offer a new the rapeutic approach in the treatment of pre- treated locally recurrent unresectable a/m 
HER2 -positive/HR -positive or negative breast cancer in combination with trastuzumab ± fulvestrant.   
The potential for drug- drug interaction (DDI) between MEN1611 and trast uzumab is relatively low 
considering that: (i) there is no  evidence in the literature of PK interactions between trastuzumab and 
other small molecules; (ii) considering the pathways involved in the elimination of a small molecule 
(e.g. renal and biliary ex cretion, CYP450- mediated metabolism) and a monoclonal antibody (e.g. 
renal metabolism, immunogenicity, Fc receptors, target mediated clearance), most of the possible 
DDI mechanisms can be ruled out in the case of MEN1611 and trastuzumab;  (iii) the PK profi le of 
buparlisib (PI3K inhibitor) is not influenced by [CONTACT_810128] (15).          
 
In this study, MEN1611 treatment will be continued until objective disease progression is documented or another criterion for discontinuation (e.g., toxicity, withdrawal of consent) is met for subjects affected by [CONTACT_810129].  
To mitigate the  risk of the administration of the study treatment and to guarantee the subject s’ safety 
during the study participation, the following measures have been applied in accordance with European Medicines Agency ( EMA ) guidelines ( 32): 
1. The d ose-escalation  will follow the traditional 3 + 3 study design; we decided to consider the 
maximum dose of 48 mg BID according to the data in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB), being 
the MTD in the FIH study.  The [ADDRESS_1120272]. Considering the combination therapy, the MEN1611 starting dose selected for th e dose escalation is 1/[ADDRESS_1120273] No.: 2017-004631-[ADDRESS_1120274] s 
having any serious and/or unstable pre -existing psychiatric or neurologic illness or other 
conditions that could interfere with subject 's safety, considering the toxicity profile of the class 
of drug (i.e., buparlisib ). 
3. As far as treatment  with trastuzumab  is concerned , for the first administration , subject s will 
be monitored for at least [ADDRESS_1120275] progressing 
infusion reactions premedication is recommended, according to local practice. MEN1611 as 
other PI3K inhibitors are reported to cause gastro -intestinal AEs and hyperglycaemia; for this 
reason , a strict monitoring of safety laboratory test including blood sugar levels as well as 
recording any AEs will be done at each visit and appropriate supportive care will be 
immediately started; moreover, being well described in the FIH Chugai Pharmaceutical study 
that the occurrence of gastrointestinal side effects, as well as hyperglycaemia are common and 
could be severe, we have clearly stated in the exclusion criteria that National Cancer Institute 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03 ( NCI CTCAE  v4.03) ≥grade 
2 diarrhoea , which is not resolved in the week prior to the start of treatment will be considered

haemoglobin [ HbA1c] > 7%) and fasting plasma glucose  (FPG)  > 126 mg/dL will not be 
included in the study.

Measures to mitigate the additional risks caused b y COVID -19 are:  
• Current national laws and local recommendations for prevention of pandemic will be strictly 
adhered . 
• Subjects will be encouraged to follow strictly local mitigation recommendations when ambulatory (e.g., social distancing, use of mask, etc.). 
• Access to Clinical site will be as per local COVID -19 control measures. 
• Since the implementation of this protocol v ersion 4, subjects on 3-weekly trastuzumb

performed on a 3-weekly basis (instead of weekly) starting from Cycle 5 Day 1 ( after 12 
weeks of treatment) without affecting the subject’s safety considering that the most common 
and clinically relevant toxicities have been observed during the first 8 weeks of treatment.  
• For patients on 3-weekly trastuzumb administration schedule, w eekly safety follow-up for

• Based on the local circumstances , to be reassessed on an ongoing basis , additional measures 
will be considered for implementation including : 
o Interruption or slowing down of recruitment of new trial participants ;  
o Postponement of activation of sites that have not yet been initiated ; 
o Transfer of trial participants to investigational sites away from risk zones, or closer 
to their home; 
o IMP re -distribution among sites , in case of shortage of study drug; 
o Increase of IMP kits dispensation during the site visits  to cover longer periods of 
time and/or distribution of IMP to study participant’s  home; 
o Administration of trastuzumab to be performed at local outpatient facilities  closer to

 Overall Study Design and Plan Description  
This study is designed as an open- label, multicentre, Dose -escalation and Cohort -expansion, Phase  Ib 
combination study to be conducted in approximately 50 European , Russian  and US sites.  
Subjects with HER2 -positive a/m breast cancer harbouring PIK3CA mutation and pre -treated with at 
least two lines of anti-HER2 based therapy will be enrolled. 
The study design is in agreement with the current regulatory EMA guidelines  regarding the evaluation 
of anticancer medicinal products in man [EMA, Guideline on evaluation of anticancer medicinal 
products in man, Rev. 4 - December 2012;  EMA/CHMP/205/95 under revision (Rev.5)]. 
The study is aimed to determine the MTD and RP2D of MEN1611 when administered in combination with trastuzumab ± fulvestrant to aforementioned subjects according with HR status. The study will consist of 2  sequential steps . The overall study design is shown in Section 2.1. At the 
time of the implementation of this Protocol Version 4.0, Step 1 has been completed . Step 2 study 
procedures for subjects  on a 3-weekly trastuzumab administration schedule are tabulated in 
Section s 2.2, 2.3, 2.4 and 2.5 and described in Section 8.5.2. For subjects who started  on a weekly 
trastuzumab administration schedule (patients already included in the study at the time this Protocol 
version 4.0 is in force) , Step 2 study procedures are described in  APPENDIX I: Study Procedures 
ONLY for subjects on weekly trastuzumab administration schedule. 
Step 1 (Dose -escalation Phase) :  
A 3-cohort, ascending -doses’ (16 mg, 32 mg and 48 mg, BID) design identif ied the MTD and the 
RP2D of MEN1611 in combination with trastuzumab ± fulvestrant with  
MEN1611 to be  given in combination with weekly intravenous infusion of trastuzumab ± 4 -week 
intramuscular (IM) injection of fulvestrant until objective disease progression is documented or 
another criterion for discontinuation is met. The number of subjects per cohort was assigned according to a 3 + [ADDRESS_1120280] 3 subjects experiences a dose lim iting toxicity 
(DLT), [ADDRESS_1120281] dose level at which no more than 1 of 6 subjects experience a DLT during the DLT assessment window (28 days).  
RP2D is defined as MTD or the maximum dose judged to be tolerable by [CONTACT_12217].

The RP2D will be confirmed  in additional male and female subjects  with PIK3CA mutated/HER2+ 
a/m breast cancer , in order to achieve a total of 30 subjects  in each of the following treatment cohorts 
exposed to the MTD:  
• HR-negative men and women, and HR-positive men and premenopausal women will be 
enrolled to receive MEN1611 + trastuzumab. 
• HR-positive postmenopausal women  will be enrolled to receive MEN1611 + trastuzumab + 
fulvestrant. 
Note:  Hormonal treatment such as GnRH analogs as per clinical local practice is allowed in 
HR-positive premenopausal women and male subjects assigned to receive MEN1611 + trastuzumab. 
Step 2 will explore the preliminary anti- tumour activity of MEN1611 combined with trastuzumab ± 
fulvestrant with further assessment of their safety and tolerability.  
The overall study duration will depend on the completion of the escalating dose levels/cohorts, the 
number of subjects to be treated per each dose -cohort, the completion of the expansion cohort up to 
a total of [ADDRESS_1120282]’s response . All subjects pre -screened for the PIK3CA mutation will undergo a maximum 4-
week Screening Period. If the complete assessment  of the eligibility criteria is available within [ADDRESS_1120283]’s eligibility must be confirmed by [CONTACT_22955]. Screen failures can be re-screened upon Medical Monitor’s approval. 
. Individual study duration will depend on the duration of the study treatment which will continue up 
to disease progression or study discontinuation for other reasons. The End of Study Visit will be 
performed 4 weeks  (± 7 days)  after the last dose of MEN1611 or at the time of Study Withdrawal. 
Unscheduled assessments showing disease progression and leading to subject’s withdrawal can 
replace the End of Study Visit provided that all assessment/procedures scheduled for this visit are completed. After the End of Study Visit, all subjects evaluable for efficacy will be followed for 
survival status according  to local practice (a visit or a telephone call) every 12 weeks ± [ADDRESS_1120284] who discontinues the study treatment  
). For safety monitoring, all serious adverse events (SAEs) with a suspected causal relationship to the 
study treatment that occur  after End of Study must be recorded and notified to the Sponsor  as reported 
in section 8.6.2.

possible. 
Each vial of trastuzumab has to be reconstituted with sterile water before the infusion with sodium chloride solution according to the instructions provided in the Summary of Products Characteristucs 
(SmPc) .  
8.4.3 Fulvestrant  
In both Step 1 and Step 2, IM fulvestrant 500 mg will be administered only to HR -positive 
postmenopausal subjects every 4 weeks from Day 1 of Cycle 1 ; an additional dose will be 
administered on Day [ADDRESS_1120307] be given according to the instructions provided in the SmPc.   
Note: The following warnings should be considered by [CONTACT_810140]: 
Fulvestrant formulation contains 10% weight/volume ethanol (alcohol), i.e. up to [ADDRESS_1120308] -feeding women, children and high- risk groups such as 
subjects with liver disease, or epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]. 
8.4.4 Sequence  of Study Treatment  Administration  
Based on PK profile of MEN1611, no potential DDI effects are expected, nevertheless, based on the time points for PK sample collection and logistics aspects, it is deemed suitable to recommend the following order of study treatment administration for cycles when all 3 study treatments are r equired 
to be administered: 
1. Trastuzumab  
2. MEN1611 
Clinical Study Protocol 
EudraCT No.: 2017-004631-[ADDRESS_1120309] the study treatment compliance (see sec. 10.1.3). 
8.4.6 Management of Toxicities due to MEN1611 and Dosage Modification  
Cycle 1:  
Subjects should receive full doses of the study treatment unless a DLT is observed. No dose 
adjustment is permitted.  In case of a DLT, the study treatment will be discontinued and the subject 
will be  withdrawn from the study. 
Additional clinical and laboratory assessments will be performed 3  days after the observation of any 
of the following toxicities: 
• ANC <1.0 × 109/L. 
• Anaemia (haemoglobin < 8.0 g/dL).  
• Platelet count <75 × 109/L. 
• Non-haematological toxicity grade ≥2.  
• Grade ≥2 nausea, vomiting, skin rash, diarrhoea and hyperglycaemia despi[INVESTIGATOR_40780]. 
At the time of these additional clinical and laboratory assessments, subjects with no dose -limiting 
haematological and non -haematological toxicities will remain at the same dose and schedule.  
Cycle 2 an d Subsequent Cycles:  
The study treatment will be administered only if all the following criteria for re -treatment are met:  
• ANC ≥1.0 x 109/L. 
• Platelet count ≥ 100.0 x 109/L. 
• No grade ≥2 non- haematological toxicity attributable to MEN1611, for nausea, vomiti ng, 
diarrhoea and hyperglycaemia despi[INVESTIGATOR_40799].  
• Grade ≤2 general disorder (i.e., fatigue, asthenia) and asymptomatic grade ≤ 3 organ abnormalities which the Investigator judges not clinically relevant for continuing the study treatme nt. 
• Skin toxicity, if previously reported, must regress to grade ≤2. 
Clinical Study Protocol 
EudraCT No.: 2017-004631-[ADDRESS_1120310] an additional clinical and laboratory 
assessment every 3  days (a window of ± 1 day is allowed) until treatment may be resumed a t the same 
full dose or at a reduced dose. No dose modification is allowed for trastuzumab or fulvestr ant. Any MEN1611 dose reduction or 
interruption for toxicity will be permitted after the [ADDRESS_1120311] recovers from toxicity:  
• For grade 2 toxicity and/or <7 days delay in scheduled treatment, treatment will restart on the same full dose.  
• For grade 3 toxicity and/or 8 to 14 days’ delay in scheduled treatm ent, treatment will restart 
at a reduced dose ( from 48 mg BID to 32 mg BID, and from 32 mg BID to 16 mg BDI ). Up 
to two dose level reductions will be allowed. 
• For grade 4 toxicity and/or 15 to 21 days’ delay in treatment, the subject will be withdrawn from  the study or may be treated with a reduced dose (the previous dose level as indicated 
above, according to Investigator’ s clinical judgment).  
• If the delay in scheduled study treatment exceeds [ADDRESS_1120312] awn from the study. 
For specific toxicities such as hyperglycaemi a, diarrhoea, and skin toxicity, Investigators may 
consider management  recommendations in APPENDIX I V: Recommendations for Management of 
Toxicities related  to MEN1611. 
Subjects meeting the re -treatment criteria may continue therapy until there is clear evidence of disease 
progression or intolerable toxicities or subject refusal, whichever occurs first. 
8.4.7  Prohibited and Concomitant Medications  
During the study subjects are not allowed to receive any chronic treatment with steroids or another 
immunosuppressive agent. 
Any chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy (with the exception of anti -HER2 treatment), 
biologic treatment, and endocrine therapy in HR+ postmenopausal subject s is not allowed dur ing the 
study and within [ADDRESS_1120313] administration of any study treatment (Day  ˗7 or Day  1 of 
Cycle  1, as applicable) . 
 
   

Clinical Study Protocol 
EudraCT No.: 2017-004631-[ADDRESS_1120314] cancer are not allowed to receive warfarin sodium 
therapy or any other Coumadin- derivative anticoagulant and concurrent hormone replacement therapy.  
Concomitant and prior (i.e., within 30 days before Screening) medicati ons shall be carefully checked 
since the use of the above reported medications may represent an exclusion criterion making the subject ineligible to participate in the study. Furthermore, the regular and occasional use of any concomitant medication  has to be recorded starting from Screening until the End of Study Visit.  
8.4.[ADDRESS_1120315] be avoided from 48  hours before and during any study visit. Subjects should 
not consume more than 3 units per day during the off -site days during the study (1 unit = 200  mL beer 
or 100 mL wine or 25 mL distilled spi[INVESTIGATOR_2120]).

• have received at least [ADDRESS_1120317] recent archived FFPE tissue  and in plasma samples 
(ctDNA sequencing, centrally analysed) . Inclusion in the study will be done based on PIK3CA 
mutations detected  in FFPE tissue  only.  
Note:  In case no archived tissue sample is available, a new biopsy of the primary tumour or a metastasis 
should only be obtained upon subject  consent, and based on the investigators judgment that there is no 
additional risk to the subject ’s safety. The samples will be centrally analysed using validated Cobas® 
PIK3CA Mutation Test.  
Screening Period (Day -27 to Day - 1): 
During the [ADDRESS_1120318] will be screened for eligibility.  
The following procedures will be performed at Screening: 
• Check of inclusion/exclusion criteria. 
• Recording of demographic data.  
• Standard medical, surgical and medication history. 
• Smoking history and current status. 
• Verification of pre - or postmenopausal status (see  APPENDIX II: Contraceptive Guidance

8.5.5 Pharmacodynamics Procedure and Assessment  
Assessment of MEN1611 biolog ical activity when given in combination with trastuzumab ± 
fulvestrant will be performed in hair follicle, PRP and tumour biopsy. p-Akt, p- PRAS40 and other 
potential biomarkers related to the PI3K/Akt pathway (e.g. p -70S6K, and p -[COMPANY_004]3b) will be analysed. 
Details of the PD evaluation will be described in the Laboratory manual. 
Hair Follicle and Platelet Rich Plasma  
Hair follicles and blood sampling for PRP will be taken at the following timepoints:  
 
For subjects on weekly trastuzumab administration schedule  
• Day 1 and Day 22 of Cycle 1 (Visit 1 and Visit 4): Pre-dose (0 hours), 2, 6 and 12 hours 
after MEN1611 dose.  
• Day 8 and Day 15 of Cycle 1 (Visit 2 and Visit 3): Pre -dose and 2 hours after MEN1611 dose.  
• Day 1 and Day 15 of Cycle 2 (Visit 1 and Visit 3): Pre-dose. 
• Day 1 of Cycle 3 (Visit 1): Pre -dose. 
For subjects on 3- weekly trastuzumab administration schedule  
• Day 1 of Cycle 1 (Visit): Pre -dose (0 hours), 2, 6 and 12 hours after MEN1611 dose. A time 
window of -2 hours is allowed for the 12 hours timepoint.  
• Day 8 and Day 15 of Cycle 1 (Visit 2 and Visit 3): Pre -dose and 2 hours after MEN1611 dose.  
• Day 1 of Cycle 2 (Visit 1): Pre -dose, 2, 6 and 12 hours after  MEN1611 dose. A time window 
of -2 hours is allowed for the 12 hours timepoint. 
• Day 8 of Cycle 2 (Visi t 2): Pre -dose  
• Day 1 and Day 15 of Cycle 3 (Visit 1 and Visit 3): Pre-dose  
Note:  Hair follicles should preferably be collected from the eyebrow, however scalp is acceptable 
(please refer to the Laboratory manual) .  
Hair follicle samples will be centrally analysed for the assessment of p-PRAS40. 
PRP samples will be centrally analysed for the assessment of p -Akt, and other potential biomarkers 
related to the PI3K/Akt pathway . 
Tumour Biopsy (optional dependent on subject consent)   
Optional tumour biopsy will be performed upon subject’s consent before the first daily dose of 
MEN1611 (Screening Period) ; a second biopsy will be taken at  Cycle 3. 
 These samples will be centrally analysed for the assessment of of p -Akt, and other potential biomarkers 
related to the PI3K/Akt pathway in tumour.

Collection of tumour biopsy is recommended in order to confirm that target inhibition is also 
occurring in the tumour. This should be particularly encouraged for  tumours that can be  readily 
biopsied. 
8.5.6 Safety Assessment  
Safety and tolerability endpoints will be derived from the following measurements/evaluations:  
• Incidence, intensity, CTCAE v4.03 grading, seriousness and treatment -causality of Treatment 
Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs).

 Hyperglycaemia.  
Note:  Nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea will be considered a DLT if grade ≥ 3 for more than 
72 hours with adequate antiemetic and other supportive care. Skin rash and hyperglycaemia 
will be considered DLT if they reach grade ≥3 despi[INVESTIGATOR_810079] e institution 
guidelines. 
o No recovery from a non- DLT relative to the above exceptions of grade ≥ 3 toxicity to 
grade ≤ 2 for more than 14 days.

o Any other study treatment- related toxicity considered significant enough to be qualified 
as DLT in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_810080] o f the Investigators.  
Throughout Step 1, although dose- escalation is primarily based on the incidence of DLTs during the 
first 4 study weeks , toxicities that meet criteria for DLTs and are observed over  the subsequent weeks  
are also taken into account for the assessment of toxicity and the definition of maximum dose judged 
to be tolerable.  
Step 2 (Cohort-expansion Phase) 
• Confirmation  of RP2D, defined as  MTD or the maximum dose judged to be tolerable.

 Adverse Event Definitions, Monitoring/Recording and Management  
8.6.1 Definitions 
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event (AE)  

Clinical Study Protocol 
EudraCT No.: 2017-004631-[ADDRESS_1120339] a causal relationship with this trea tment.  
An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Drug Relationship  
The relationship  between an AE and study treatments will be judged according to the following 
categories:  
1. Certainly related : The event or laboratory test abnormality (AE) with plausible time relationship 
to the drug intake and it cannot be explained by a concurrent disease or other drugs. The response 
to withdrawal of the drug (dechallenge) should be plausible (pharmacologically, pathologically). The event must be definitive pharmacologically or phenomenologically (i.e., an objective and specif ic medical disorder or a recognised pharmacological phenomenon), using a satisfactory 
rechallenge procedure if necessary.  
2. Probably related : The event or laboratory test abnormality (AE) with reasonable time 
relationship to the drug intake, it is unlikely to be attributed to a concurrent disease or other drugs and it follows a clinically reasonable response on withdrawal (dechallenge). Rechallenge (AE reappearance after drug reintroduction) is not required. 
3. Possibly related : The event or laboratory test abnormality (AE) with a reasonable time relation 
to the drug intake, but it could also be explained by [CONTACT_19699]. Information on drug withdrawal (dechallenge) may be lacking or unclear.  
4. Unassessable/Unclassifiable : The relationship cannot be judged, because of the information is 
insufficient or contradictory and data cannot be supplemented or verified.  
5. Unlikely related : The event or laboratory test abnormality (AE), with a time to drug intake that 
makes a relationship improbable (but not impossible). Disease or other drugs provide plausible explanations.  
Not Related : The event or laboratory test abnormality (AE), with a time to drug intake with an 
unreasonable relationship and or non- plausibility and/or the existence of a clear alternative  explanation.  
Treatment -Emergent Adverse Events  
AEs will be categorized as Treatment -Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE) or Non -TEAE. I f an AE  occur s 
for the first time or if it worsens in terms of seriousness or severity after the first study drug intake  (either 
MEN1611, trastuzumab or fulvestrant  or their combination) it will be classified as TEAE,  otherwise it 
will be classified as non -TEAE or clinical event.

[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs)  
Any untoward and unintended responses to an investigational medici nal product  related to any dose 
administered. The definition covers also medication errors and uses outside what is foreseen in the 
protocol, including misuse and abuse of the product. 
The definition implies a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship between the event and MEN1611 , 
trastuzumab, fulvestrant or any of their combinations . This means that there are facts (evidence) or 
arguments to suggest a causal relationship.  
ADRs are considered all AEs  for which the relationship is considered as:  
1. Certainly related  
2. Probably related  
3. Possibly related  
4. Unassessable/Unclassifiable  
AEs are not considered as ADRs when the relationship is judged as:  
1. Unlikely related  
2. Not related  
[IP_ADDRESS] Seriousness  
Any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death; 
• Is life-threatening; 
“Life -threatening” means that the subject  was at immediate risk of death at the time of the 
SAE (Serious Adverse Event); it does not refer to a SAE that hypothetically might have caused 
death if it was more severe.  
• Requires in -subject hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_15574] ; 
This means that  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_810081] a consequence of the event. Visits to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_810082].  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity ; 
“Persistent  or significant disability or incapacity” means a permanent or significant and 
substantial disruption of a person’s ability to carry out routine activities.  
• Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect;

• Is other medically important condition that may jeopard ise the subject or may require 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  
Medical and scientific  judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is 
appropriate in situations  where none of the outcomes listed above occur s. Important medical events 
that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_810083] y be considered serious.  
Note:  These characteristics/consequences have to be considered at the time the event occurs. For 
example, regarding a life- threatening event, this refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of 
death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death 
if it were more severe.  
Any other AE/ADR which is not included in the above definitions will be considered as non- serious.  
Note: Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_810084] 24 hours or pr e-planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_810085], such as chemotherapy administration, shall not qualify as SAE.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event (AE)/Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) Intensity (Severity)  
Each event will be graded for severity using the classifications of NCI CTCAE v 4.03. For events no t 
addressed in the NCI CTCAE v4.03 classifications , the following grading will apply:  
• Mild (Grade 1) - Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicated.  
• Moderate (Grade 2) - Moderate; minimal, local or non -invasive intervention indicated; 
limiting age -appropriate instrumental activity of daily living.  
• Severe (Grade 3) - Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospit alization or prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_374]; disabling; limiting self -care 
activity of daily living.  
• Life-threatening (Grade 4) - Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
• Death (Grade 5) - Related to adverse event.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) Expectedness  
An ADR is considered unexpected when the nature, intensity, or outcome of which is not consistent with the applicable product information provided in the Reference Safety Document (MEN1611 Investigator’s Brochure  in force , trastuzumab SmPC and fulvestrant SmPC ).

8.6.[ADDRESS_1120340]’s relatives or delegates through phone calls, letters 
or e-mails will also be recorded. In these cases , the Investigator will try to obtain medical confirmation 
and assessment of the occurred AE.  
When an AE has occurred, the Investigator shall record it on the respective eCRF -AE recording 
pages, whether serious or non- serious  and whether or not thought to be drug -related,  observed 
in or reported by [CONTACT_423] (or relatives/delegates), specifying his/her  judgement on the causal

The Sponsor’s confirmation of reception of the SAE report must be kept in the subject’s records.  Any questions arising during the processing and medical review of the SAE will b e managed by 
[CONTACT_444895] (i.e., queries in the eCRF). In case of a breakdown of the eCRF system, 
queries will be sent by e-mail.  
Any information provided by [CONTACT_5256] a query reply or as a follow -up SAE report will be 
processed in the same way as the initial SAE report, within the required timeframe.  
When relevant, the eCRF pages concerning medical history, concomitant medication and laboratory tests will also be retrieved by [CONTACT_1034]’s S DSU. 
Any further significant informati on and supporting documentation that become available (such as 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_284944], tests, procedures, autopsy evidence of the cause of death, etc.) shall be  
entered in the eCRF or  provided by e-mail to the Sponsor’s SDSM (in case of eCRF unavailability),

[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting Duties of the Sponsor  
The Sponsor has appointed a centralized Study Drug Safety Unit (SDSU) team to the study, encompassing the Study Drug Safety Manager, the Study Drug Safety Manager Deputy, a Pharmacovigilance Technician and a Study Drug Safety Assistant. The SDSU team will be responsible for the management of AEs from all the sites in compliance with the applicable regulatory requirements (including SAEs and S[LOCATION_003]Rs management) and all safety communications submitted to the  sites, RAs and ECs accordingly to the procedures described in the corresponding study Safety 
Management Plan (SMP).  
In addition, the  Sponsor shall ensure that all relevant information about any suspected serious and 
unexpected adverse reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) is expeditiously reported to the CAs (including Eudra 
Vigilance Clinical Trial Module for clinical trials for which a n EudraCT number has been assigned) 
and ECs (following general and local rules and procedures) . The  deadlines to be complied with, 
starting  on the date of first knowledge, intended as the day when the Sponsor’s SDSU or CRO 
receives the notification of the S[LOCATION_003]R , are the following: 
• Fatal and life threatening unexpected cases, no later than 7 days; 
• Other unexpected serious cases, no later than 15 days.  
The Sponsor shall ensure that all relevant new information is also expeditiously reported as follow -

Note: The Sponsor will be responsible for expeditiously reporting S[LOCATION_003]R cases attributable to 
trastuzumab or fulvestrant, following the  procedure described in the SMP, and informing the 
corresponding MAH (as per SmPC details) of the case and of the expedited r eporting done. 
8.6.4 Management of Non -Serious Adverse Events and/or Laboratory 
Abnormalities 
The Investigator must record all the available information concerning any non- serious AE (whether 
or not deemed related to the study treatment) in the corresponding section of the eCRF : eCRF -AE 
pages, within [ADDRESS_1120346] knowledge of the occurrence of the event  (including 
those performed in Unscheduled Visit and required for AE diagnosis). 
When the site personnel enters a new AE/case in the eCRF, an au tomatic alert notification is generated 
and sent to the Sponsor’s S DSM.  
When relevant  for the correct assessment of the case, e CRF pages concerning medical history, 
concomitant medication and/or laboratory test , including any updates,  will also be retrieved by [CONTACT_429]’s S DSM.  
Any further significant information and supporting documentation that become available (such as copi[INVESTIGATOR_444833], procedures, etc.) shall also be entered  by [CONTACT_112089].  
In addition, during the clinical study, clinically significant abnormalities in laboratory analyses , 
urinalysis, physical examination, vital signs or 12- lead ECG , ECHO or MUGA scan  or ECOG PS  
(newly occurring after ICF signature [CONTACT_810161]), which are 
considered clinically relevant by [CONTACT_079] (such as values significantly above or under normal range or which require an intervention or diagnostic tests, or may result in the discontinuation of the study treatment), should be reported as AEs. All abnormalities in laboratory values should be collected and reviewed by [CONTACT_810149] a bi-monthly basis. 
8.6.[ADDRESS_1120347] in a dedicated “Pregnancy Exposure Report Form”  any case of 
pregnancy exposure occurring in a female subject or in a female partner of a male subject enrolled in 
the study while participating in the study,  occurring during the treatment and follow -up periods. 
The “Pregnancy Exposure Report Forms” are distributed to the sites to be used for this purpose. 
In case of pregnancy, the subject  will be withdrawn from the study treatment. The Investigator is 
requested to follow each case of pregnancy exposure until the outcome, provided that the female subject or the female partner of a male subject enrolled in the study has signed the related pregnancy ICF.

The form will be sent to the Sponsor’s SDSM preferably by e -mail within 5 days after the Investigator 
becomes aware of  the pregnancy and it is also to be fully completed and sent again within 5 days after 
the outcome is known,  
If the pregnancy results in an abnormal outcome, this will be recorded in the eCRF as an SAE and managed as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. In case the eCRF is no more available, it will be notified  
through the paper CRF-SAE form and sent to the Sponsor by e- mail 
8.6.6 Management of misuse and overdose cases  
Although study drug misuse and overdose are not  considered AEs per s è, both issues should be 
reported to the Sponsor’s SDSU  within the same timelines as an SAE, even if they may not result in 
an adverse outcome . In the event of overdose, the subject  should be observed closely for signs of 
toxicity. Appropriate supportive treatment should be provided if clinically indicated. 
For the purpose of this protocol, an overdose is any dose of the investigational drugs ( MEN1611, 
Trastuzumab or Fulvestrant)  which is more than the assigned dose level for that subje ct. The 
corresponding information should be entered in the AE page in the eCRF no later than 24 hours of 
awareness by [CONTACT_779]. Once the page is completed and saved by [CONTACT_692646], an 
alert notification will be automatically sent to the  Sponsor. ONLY if the eCRF system does not work 
or if the eCRF is not available, the paper SAE report form shall be used and sent to the Sponsor by [CONTACT_6968].  
The reporting proc edures are described in detail in the SAE report form completion manual 
distributed  to the sites . 
In addition, if an AE (serious o non- serious) is associated with an overdose, it will be recorded on the 
AE page in the e- CRF, recording the overdose details. 
If the pharmacy discovers that an overdose has or may have been administered, they  should 
immediately contact [CONTACT_476145] (or their delegate) and let them know. 
8.6.7 Periodic  Safety Reporting  
[IP_ADDRESS] Annual Safety Reporting 
Once a year throughout the clinical study, the Sponsor will submit to the concerned national CAs and 
ECs requiring it according to their country specific  legislation, a Development Safety Update Report  
(DSUR) , taking into account all new safety information received during the reporting period. In the 
US an Investigational N ew Drug (IND)  Report  will also be  submitted to the FDA, according to the 
applicable legislation .

In Europe and [LOCATION_003] , t he DSUR will be submitted to CAs and ECs by [CONTACT_444899] 60 calendar 
days after the Data Lock Point (DLP).  
The IB in force at the start of the reporting period should serve as the reference safety information for 
the document preparation. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Periodic Line -listings Safety Reporting  
All S [LOCATION_003]Rs occurred in the MEN1611-01 study and/or in any other ongoing trial using MEN1611 
and conducted by [CONTACT_444900], either in the European Community or in a third country, will be recorded 
in a Line - listing prepared by [CONTACT_599581] (every 6 months).  
The final L ine - listing will be sent to the applicable ECs and Investigators, if and as required per 
country regulations. All Investigators  are required to acknowledge their correct reception and reading 
of this information to the Sponsor by e- mail.  
Note: If no S[LOCATION_003]R s occur, the Line- listing will not be necessary.  
8.6.[ADDRESS_1120348] the safety of subjects (e.g.: a SAE 
which could be associated with the trial procedures and which could modify the conduct of the trial, major safety findings from newly completed animal stud ies, such as carcinogenicity, or non -serious 
AEs of special interest as per DSC indication).  
The procedure in such cases should be the following: the SDSU will urgently inform the Menarini Project Team (MPT) and the Global Director of Clinical Sciences (GDCS) in order that the 
appropriate actions are immediately taken (e.g.: urgent measures and th eir notification to the 
authorities, a substantial amendment to the protocol or the early termination of the trial if necessary).  
Moreover, the Sponsor shall inform the National Competent Authority as well as the concerned IRBs/ ECs and participating invest igators of any safety issues which might materially alter the current 
benefit -risk assessment of the study IMP.  
For S[LOCATION_003]Rs occurred with non- IMP (e.g. concomitant medication) the investigators will be 
encouraged to follow the post -marketing pharmacovigila nce rules according to the country 
requirements. An y S[LOCATION_003]R attributable to trastuzumab or fulvestrant  will be expeditiously reported 
as described in the relevant chapter. The corresponding MAH will be notified on the case and the expedited reporting done.  
Clinical Study Protocol 
EudraCT No.: 2017-004631-[ADDRESS_1120349] (as per the Safety Review Committee [SRC]) 
are present. However, if after the end of the study the Investigator becomes aware of any SAEs with 
a suspected causal relationship to the study treatment, they should be duly reported to the Sponsor. These SAEs should be recorded in the eCRF if it is available. If the eCRF is not available, the paper CRF -AE form  will be used as a backup.  
Subjects who discontinued the treatment for safety reason will be followed until the event disappears, the subject’s condition stabilises, or until recovery from all toxic effects and longer in case of expected delayed toxicity.  
 Safety Review  Committee  
A Safety Review Committee (SRC) will be established consisting of the Principal Investigator(s) and 
the Sponsor’s qualified Medical Representative(s), as well as invited experts (such as Statistician and 
Pharmacokineticist), as appropriate. The SRC is responsible for reviewing and evaluating all the 
available safety data, any DLTs, PK and PD data collected during Step 1 in order to confirm the 
RP2D to be tested in Step 2. The SRC may also meet in ad hoc meetings at its discretion, as needed 
in response to events occurring in the study. Data will be provided to the SRC as described in the 
approved Data Review Plan. Roles and responsibilities of the SRC as well as the meeting schedule 
are provided in a separate SRC Charter.  
8.7.1 Blinded Independent Review Committee  
There will be two Blinded Independent Review Committee s (BIRCs ) with the aim s: 1) to evaluate 
each subject’s CT/MR scans, applying RECIST 1.1 guideline ; 2) to evaluate subject’s ECG traces 
collected at selected time points . The details of the execution of the blinded review s are provided in

9. STATISTICAL METHODS AND DETERMINATION OF 
SAMPLE SIZE 
 Determination of Sample Size  
A maximum of 18 DLT evaluable subjects need  to be enrolled in Step 1 (Dose- escalation Phase).  
During Step 2 (Cohort -expansion Phase), the RP2D will be tested in combination with trastuzumab 
and with trastuzumab and fulvestrant in postmenopausal HR -positive subjects in order to achieve a 
total of 30 subjects  (considering also Step 1) in each of the treatment cohorts exposed to the MTD. 
Subjects who drop out prior to be evaluable for DLT during the dose -escalation will be replaced. 
Taking in consideration a 15% drop -out rate, approximately 80 subjects will be enrolled in the study.  
Due to the incidence of PIK3CA mutations and considering the above mentioned drop- out rate , Pre-
screening and Screening failure rates , around 600 HER2 -positive a/m breast cancer subjects have to 
be pre- screened.  
 Analysis Populations  
The following analysis population will be considered in the statistical analysis:  
• DLT population 
All subjects receiving a t least 80% of MEN1611 and 100% of trastuzumab and/or fulvestrant 
during cycle [ADDRESS_1120350] 
that has experienced a DLT will also be considered evaluable.  
Subjects enrolled in the Dose- escalation Phase who are not DLT evaluable will be replaced.  
• Safety population 
All subjects receiving at least 1 dose of MEN1611. 
• Efficacy population  
All eligible subjects who receive at least [ADDRESS_1120351] 1  disease 
assessment are to be considered evaluable for efficacy.  
• PK population  
All subjects receiving the study treatment and with reliable drug assay data relevant for the 
PK parameter of interest.

9.3.4 Safety Analysis  
Safety analysis will be performed on the safety population through descriptive statistics during each 
study phase. Summary statistics will report the incidence of the AEs by [CONTACT_810150] y grade, dose 
level, relationship to study treatment and overall. Counts and percentages will be reported for the results of ECG, laboratory values, vital signs, physical examination, all classified as Normal/Abnormal Not Clinically Significant/Abnormal Clinically Significant by [CONTACT_774726].  
Descriptive statistics will also be produced for the extent of exposure, overall drug administration, drug administration by [CONTACT_444905]. 
9.3.5 Data imputations  
Missing values will not be imputed since for every analysis an observed -cases approach will be 
applied. 
 Protocol Violations and Data Review Meeting  
Categories of protocol violations will be defined and will be integrated in the statistical analysis.  
A data review meeting (DRM) will take place at the end of the study in order to evaluate and accept 
the data management report, discuss remaining issues (outstanding queries, unresolved errors) and to confirm and approve relevant protocol violations. After this final DRM has taken place and the database is considered cleaned, the database will be locked.  
 Statistical Analysis Plan  
The statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be finalised before the lock of the study database. The SAP will describe in detail study endpoints and the statistical analyses, including the statistical analysis of the primary endpoint to be performed, as well as additional endpoints and analyses not planned in the protocol. In case changes of the original primary endpoint or of the original primary analyses will occur d uring the study, these changes will be the subject of a substantial protocol amendment.

for anti -HIV antibodies, anti -hepatitis B core antigen (anti -HBcAg) antibodies, anti -hepatitis 
B surface antigen (anti -HbsAg) antibodies, HBV- DNA, HCV- ribonucleic acid (HCV -RNA).  
Note:  In case the laboratory tests for anti -HIV a ntibodies, anti -HbcAg antibodies, anti -HbsAg 
antibodies, HBV -DNA and HCV- RNA have been performed within [ADDRESS_1120360]’s management, these tests will not be repeated.  
• Serum pregnancy test (if appli cable).  
• Sample for urinalysis. 
• Optional new tumour biopsy to be performed upon subject’s consent and centrally analysed for PD.  
Note:  Collection of tumour biopsy is recommended in order to confirm that the target 
inhibition is also occurring in the tumour. This should be particularly encouraged for tumours that can be readily biopsied.  
A screen failure is defined as follows: 
o A subject who does not meet the eligibility criteria required for study participation during the Screening Period. 
o A subject who no longer meets eligibility criteria at study Visits  0 or 1 (i.e., Day  ˗7 or 
Day 1 of Cycle 1, when applicable). 
o A subject whose time window between Screening and Visit  1 (i.e., Day  1 of Cycle  1, 
when applicable) is longer than 4 weeks.  
Note: If the complete assessment of the eligibility criteria is available within  [ADDRESS_1120361]’s eligibility must be confirmed by [CONTACT_1689]. Screen failures can be re-screened upon Medical Monitor’s approval.

APPENDIX II: Contraceptive Guidance and Woman of Childbearing Potential  
Definitions  
Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP) 
A woman is  considered fertile following menarche and until becoming postmenopausal unless 
permanently sterile. Permanent sterilisation methods include hysterectomy, bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_181950]. Women in the following categories are not conside red WOCBP:  
• Premenopausal female with 1 of the following: 
o Documented hysterectomy  
o Documented bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656]  
o Documented bilateral oophorectomy 
Note:  Documentation can come from the site personnel’s: review of participant’s medical records, 
medical examination, or medical history interview.  
• Premenarchal  
• Postmenopausal female  
o Females who are postmenopausal (age -related amenorrhea ≥ 12 consecutive month s 
and increased follicle- stimulating hormone [FSH] > 40 mIU/mL), or who have 
undergone hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy are exempt from pregnancy testing. If necessary to confirm postmenopausal status, an FSH will be drawn at Screening.  
o Females on ho rmone -replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in 
doubt will be required to use one of the non- hormonal highly effective contraception 
methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must 
discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status before study enrolment.

 Vasectomised partner (a vasectomised partner is a highly effe ctive contraception method 
provided that the partner is the sole male sexual partner of the WOCBP and the absence of 
sperm has been confirmed. If not, an additional highly effective method of contraception should be used.) 
 Sexual abstinence (sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatment. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant.) 
Note:  
1. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_35818]. Use should be consistent with local regulations regarding the use of contraceptive methods for participants participating in clinical studies.  
2. Hormonal contraception may be susceptible to interaction with the study treatment, which may reduce the efficacy of the contraceptive method or susceptible to a clinically relevant interaction with contraceptive steroids (observed or suspected). In this cases, two highly effective methods of contraception should be utilised during the treatment period and for at least 2 months (corresponding to time needed to eliminate study treatment plus 30 days for study treatments with genotoxic potential)   after the last dose of study treatment  
 
 Note:  For trastuzumab administration, the subject should use effective contraception during the 
treatment period with trastuzumab and for at least [ADDRESS_1120382] No.: 2017-004631-36  Study Code MEN1611- 01

Table 4. Recommendations for the treatment of study drug induced hyperglycemia  
CTCAE v.4.[ADDRESS_1120384] and recommend/reinforce on lifestyle changes, i.e. exercise and dietary 
advice. This table provides dose management recommendations. The preferred option for treating MEN1611 
induced hyperglycaemia is metformin. However, in case of intolerance to or unavailability of metformin, investigator’s judgement should be exercised and other insulin sensitizers (such as thiazolidinediones or dipeptidyl peptidase-4 Inhibitors) can be used.  
Grade 1  
Fasting glucose value >  ULN - 160 mg/dL; 
Fasting glucose value >  ULN - 8.9 mmol/L. 
For subjects with baseline values between 
> ULN - 140 mg/dL (ULN - 7.7 mmol/L ) 
this applies only for values >  140 mg/dL 
(7.7 mmol/L) Maintain MEN1611 and counsel  subject  on lifestyle changes.  
Consider adding or increasing oral anti- diabetic treatment ( i.e. metformin) in cooperation with 
diabetologist/endocrinologist.  
Monitor FPG as  clinically indicated and at least weekly for 8 weeks, then continue checking as per investigator’s 
judgement. 
Grade 2  
Fasting glucose value >  160 - 250 mg/dL;  
Fasting glucose value >  8.9 - 13.9 mmol/L  Maintain MEN1611 and counsel subject  on lifestyle ch anges.  
Start or increase oral anti -diabetic treatment i.e. metformin) in cooperation with diabetologist/endocrinologist.  
If FPG level is still increasing with maximum tolerated dose of oral-anti- diabetic treatment or persistently >  160 
mg/dL, consider addi ng an insulin- sensitizer ( i.e. pi[INVESTIGATOR_051]).  
Monitor FPG as clinically indicated and at least weekly until FPG resolves to Grade ≤1. 
Continue with anti- diabetic treatment and check at least weekly for [ADDRESS_1120385] No.: 2017-004631-36  Study Code MEN1611- 01

Clinical Study Protocol 
EudraCT No.: 2017-004631-[ADDRESS_1120390]  should be appropriately informed of potential study drug -induced diarrhoea and its management. History 
of onset, number of stools and stools composition should be obtained. Other symptoms such as fever, abdominal pain, 
cramps, distension, bloating, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and weakness should be assessed (i.e., rule out risk for 
sepsis, bowel obstruction, dehydration). Medication and dietary profile should be also obtained to ident ify any 
diarrheogenic agents or diarrhea -enhancing foods. 
Counsel on dietary modification (drink 8 to 10 large glasses of clear liquids, eat frequent small meals).  
Grade 1  
Increase of < 4 stools per day over 
baseline; mild increase in ost omy output 
compared to baseline  
Grade 2  
Increase of 4 - 6 stools per day over 
baseline; moderate increase in ostomy 
output compared to base line; limiting 
instrumental ADL  Maintain MEN1611 treatment.  
Intensive management of diarrhea must be instituted at the first sign of abdominal crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], loose stools or overt 
diarrhea. 
General recommendations:  
- Stop all lactose -containing products, alcohol, laxatives, bulk fiber and stool softeners, and high-osmolar food 
supplements. 
- Drink 8 to 10 large glasses of clear liquids per day and eating frequent small meals (e.g. bananas, rice, apple 
sauce, toast)  
Start loperamide at first sign of loose stools or abdominal crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007] : initial administration of 4 mg, then 2 mg every 4 
hrs (maximum of 16 mg/day). Diphenoxylate hydrochloride/atropi[INVESTIGATOR_810091] . Do not administer loperamide and 
diphenoxylate hydrochloride/atropi[INVESTIGATOR_810092].

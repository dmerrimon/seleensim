Version: [ 27Jul2021]   [ADDRESS_697669] -operative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a common concern for aging patients undergoing elective 
orthopedic surgery and significantly effects health outcomes.  This study aims to evaluate the incidence 
of and risk factors associated with post -operative cognitive dysfunction in aging  patients without prior 
history for  mild cognitive impairment or dementia. Furthermore, we plan to explore  neurofilament light 
(NfL), a blood biomarker of neuronal injury, to better identify patients pre -operatively at greater risk for 
dementia and therefore, more li kely to experience POCD.  This project is intended to 1) foster a better 
understanding of POCD incidence in patients undergoi ng elective surgery; 2) identify pre and peri -
operative risk factors for  POCD; and 3) explore the role of biomarkers such as NfL in predicting POCD.   
2. Study aims  
Primary Aim: Estimate the incidence of post -operative cognitive dysfunction three months after 
orthopedic surgical intervention.  
Secondary Aims:  
• Determine pre and peri -operative risk factors  associated with  development of POCD  
• Explore the role of serum  neurofiliament light (NfL) in predicting risk for development of POCD  
 
3. Background, Rationale, Significance  
In neurology clinic, aging patients frequently inquire regarding the risk of cognitive decline following 
elective orthopedic surgery.  These individuals are often faced with the challenging decision of 
proceeding with surgical intervention while risking potential cognitive decline versus deferring on 
surgery and enduring the original orthopedic condition justifying the operation.   
The term postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) describes a deterioration of cognition that is 
temporally associated with surgery (Lezak MD Neuropsychological Assessment NY 2004). As opposed to delirium, POCD depends on valid assessments of preoperative and postoperative cognitive function. The 
underlying etiology of POCD remains unclear. Cerebrovascular disease, cerebral hypoperfusion, genetic 
susceptibility, alteration in neurotransmitter function, neurohumoral stress, and central nervous system 
(CNS)  inflammatory phenomenon have all been suggested, but the principal suspect has been general 
anesthesia (Silverstein JH et al Anesthesiology March 2007). However, n umerous studies suggest that 
choice of anesthesia is not  an important factor in the development of POCD  (Wu Reg Anesth Pain Med 
2004) . 
There is an absence of guidelines related to orthopedic surgery and cognitive dysfunction risk to inform 
the decision- making process  for proceeding with surgery in the elderly .  The largest trial of POCD was 
published by [CONTACT_535968] 1,218 patients aged ≥[ADDRESS_697670] operatively, finding an overall incidence of 25.8% for cognitive dysfunction (Moller JT Lancet 1998). 
Increasing age, duration of anesthesia , little education, a second operation, postoperative  infections, 
and respi[INVESTIGATOR_535964] ([ADDRESS_697671] -op), but only age was a risk factor for late postoperative  cognitive dysfunction ([ADDRESS_697672] -op).  
Limitations to this study include the fact that results were not limited to a certain type of surgery (eg. 
Version: [ 27Jul2021]   3 orthopedics) and a MMSE of ≥[ADDRESS_697673] in which patients with mild dementia may still score within 
normal limits  ≥24 (Lezak MD Neuropsychological Assessment NY 2004) .   
Since this question of whether POCD is associated with orthopedic surgery has not been extensively investigated in the neurology  or orthopaedic  literature, we plan to study longitudinal cognitive 
performance in a cohort of n=[ADDRESS_697674] -
operative cognitive dysfunction, demographic and clinical variables related to the surger y (eg. age, 
anaesthesia, medical complications, etc) will be evaluated to identify risk factors. Variables such as cancer, alcohol abuse, and narcotic use are included for evaluation based on the literature suggesting 
these pre -disposing risk factors may relate to increased risk of POCD.  This data will serve to provide 
valuable information related to risk of cognitive dysfunction following orthopedic surgery, which will not 
only benefit neurology providers, orthopedic surgeons , but patients who are themsel ves making 
informed healthcare decisions,  as well.   
In addition, we are  interest ed in the utilization of  blood biomarkers as predictive factors of POCD.  With 
central nervous system  and peripheral nervous system neuronal injury, the concentration of 
neurofilament light chain (NfL) has been found to increase in cere brospi[INVESTIGATOR_535965] ( Olsson B 
JAMA Neurol  2018).  NfL is a subunit of neurofilaments, which are cylindrical proteins exclusively located 
in the neuronal cytoplasm, conferring structural stability to neurons.  In the setting of inflammatory, 
neurodegenerative, traumatic, or vascular injury to axons, the release of NfL sharply increases, resulting 
in detectable levels in the blood and CSF  (Disanto G Ann Neurol 2017) .  A variety of neurological 
conditions that impact the CNS and cognitive result in elevation of blood and CSF levels of NfL; these include HIV associated dementia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Creutzfeldt -Jakob disease, progressive 
supranuclear palsy, frontotemporal dementia, Lewy body dementia, and Alzheimer’s disease (Gaetani L JNNP 2019).  Since NfL is a sensitive, but non- specific marker of axonal injury, it may be an effective tool 
to distinguish aging patients who are  at risk of  undergoing pre -operative cognitive decline from those 
who are experiencing normal aging.  
4. Approach 
a. Study d esign  
This is a  prospective, cohort  study evaluating cognition at baseline and post -operatively at [ADDRESS_697675] one of the following diagnostic codes :

M19.012 primary osteoarthritis, Left shoulder  
 
In 2018, the orthopedic  center conducted 355 primary knee, 283 primary hip, and 76 primary 
shoulder/reverse shoulder surgeries.   Approximately 450 of these were completed by [CONTACT_6283]. 
Marston and Myeroff, from whose patients we will be recruiting. We will also recruit from Drs. 
Reich, Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2289], and Huang .This excludes non- elective cases, revisions, removals, supplements, 
and unis. The goal of the study is to recruit n=100 subjects meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria (see below) undergoing elective hip, shoulder, or knee surgery.   
i. Inclusion Criteria   
1. Age ≥50 and ≤90 
2. Any patient undergoing elective orthopedic surgery for hip, knee, or shoulder replacement  (as defined by [CONTACT_535969])  
ii. Exclusion Criteria  
1. History of cognitive impairment of dementia  
2. MOCA <26 
3. History of Parkinson’s disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal 
degeneration, normal pressure hydrocephalus, Huntington’s disease, stroke, 
seizure disorder, brain tumor, or brain surgery  
4. History of surgery  requiring anesthesia  within the past 3 months  
5. Non-English speaking  
 
c. Data collection process  
1. Review of Schedules:   Prior to clinic visits, the orthopedic research assistant will review 
clinic schedules to identify potential subjects for the next day. Patients  presenting for 
initial visit before  elective orthopedic surgery for hip, knee, or shoulder replacement will 
be pre -screened for this study by [CONTACT_535970]/exclusion criteria  thorough review of the electronic medical record .   
2. Pre-Surgical Clinic Visits:   During the clinic visit, potentially eligible patients will be given 
a flyer describing the research study and asked if they are interested in participating.  Any questions they have will be addressed.  If they are interested, a screening visit  will 
be scheduled and the patient will be given a copy of the informed consent to review at 
home .  If the patient is unsure about participating, they will be sent home with the 
information and the neuroscience research assistant will follow -up with a phone call in 
about [ADDRESS_697676]  will be answered , 
Version: [ 27Jul2021]   5 and an appointment will be scheduled if they are interested.  It is not feasible with the 
orthopedic clinic workflow to complete the MoCA screening during the clinic visit .   
3. Screening & Baseline Research Visits:   Combined s creening  and baseline  visits will be 
held at the Neuroscience Center (NSC)  or remote, via telephone or video (WebEx) .  
Patients will be consented.  A research assistant will review the inclusion and exclusion 
criteria.  Patient demographic factors will be entered into case report forms (CRF) and 
then into REDCap . The patient will undergo a MOCA evaluation to confirm score≥26  if in 
person, or >19 for the MOCA Blind if completed remote .  Should patients not meet  the 
study threshold for MOCA , they will be counseled regarding their score and available 
resources. Patients scoring normally on the MOCA will undergo a cognitive battery 
performed by [CONTACT_535971] .  Patients will undergo a blood draw for NfL  at NSC 
regardless of an in person visit or remote .  The blood will be sent to a [LOCATION_011] -based 
laboratory  for processing. Results from cognitive battery and blood draw will be entered 
into REDCap . Patients who complete screening will receive a $[ADDRESS_697677]. Pat ients who 
complete both the screening and baseline visits will receive a $[ADDRESS_697678] -Surgical Clinic Visits:   Patients will return to orthopedic clinic for [ADDRESS_697679] -
operative visit.  This is not a research visit.  
5. Follow -Up Research Visits :  A follow -up visit will be scheduled at NSC  or remote  for [ADDRESS_697680] -surgery  (+/-  2weeks).  The c ognitive battery will be administered .   If it is 
desired by [CONTACT_102], t his visit can be coordinated so that it is paired with the 
orthopedic follow -up appointment , which is close in location .  Results from cognitive 
battery will be entered into R REDCap .  Patients who complete the follow -up research 
visit will receive a $[ADDRESS_697681] -operatively.  A lab 
for NfL will be drawn during the screening/baseline visit.  Th is is an observational study.  There 
are no treatment interventions for this study.

f. Statistical a nalysis  plan  
The study population will be described by  [CONTACT_70166] (e.g. sex, age, race, education status) 
and baseline health (e.g. vision or hearing impairment, medical history).  The appropriate 
summary measures (mean and standard deviation for continuous variables and frequencies for 
categorical variables) will be reported.  Missing data will be assessed and if a large proportion of 
data is missing (>10%), we will compare baseline characteristics between subjects to determine if this subpopulation is significantly different. Imputation methods will be considered if 
differences are found. All statistical analyses will be performed in SAS v9.4  and evaluated at the 
0.05 significance  level , unless otherwise indicated.  
Primary Aim:  estimate the incidence of post -operative cognitive dysfunction three months after 
orthopedic surgical intervention.   
This will be defined as a 1.5 SD decline from in any one of the cognitive domains tested baseline 
to three months .  The proportion of patients who develop POCD and a 95% confidence interval 
will be reported.  
Secondary Aim 1:  determine pre and peri -operative risk factors associated with  development of 
POCD . 
We will be primarily interested in the association between incidences of POCD with the 
following risk factors:  
1. History of delirium  
2. Presence of post -operative delirium  
3. Regional versus general anesthesia

g. Power  analysis or statement of precision  
In 2018, the orthopaedic  center conducted 355 primary knee, 283 primary hip, and 76 primary 
shoulder/reverse shoulder surgeries.  Approximately 450 of these were completed by [CONTACT_6283]. Marston and Myeroff, from whose patient  populations we will be recruiting.  This excludes non-
elective cases, revisions, removals, supplements, and unis. The goal of the study is to recruit 
n=[ADDRESS_697685] to be able to recruit 
during our timeline, and the estimated study budget.  We anticipate th e POCD incidence rate 
will be between 18 and 25% based on previous literature  (Moller T et al Lancet 1998) .  A sample 
size of 100 produces a two -sided 95% confidence interval with a width equal to 0.[ADDRESS_697686] -operative 
cognitive dysfunction in normal aging adults in that the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) 
rather than the Mini Mental Status Exam (MMS E) is being used to confirm normal cognition.  
The MOCA has a 90% sensitivity for mild cognitive  impairment whereas the MMSE has an 18% 
sensitivity for mild cognitive impairment.  This  will be one of the first studies to evaluate 
patients exclusively undergoing elective orthopedic surgery whereas prior studies have looked 
at POCD following a combination of surgical procedures.   Finally, this study can be considered 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_535966] -
operative cognitive dysfunction.   
Study limitations include the absence of immediate post -operative assessment that may be 
indicative of a delirium.  Our budget allows for a cognitive assessment at baseline and then 3 
months  in n=[ADDRESS_697687] funding to evaluate cognition for this period 
of time while maintaining sufficient numbers of study subjects.  Finally, we are unable to include 
imaging biomarkers of neurodegeneration such as hippocampal atrophy on brain MRI or FDG -
hypometabolism of the precuneus/posterior cingulate as we do  not have funding to support 
these diagnostic tests.     
    
Version: [ 27Jul2021]   8 5. Setting/Environment/Organizational feasibility  
The study will be conducted at both the HealthPartners orthopedics clinic as well as the Neuroscience 
Center.   The orthopedics department performs [ADDRESS_697688]. Rosenbloom is the HealthPartners Neurology Department and Clinical Director of the Center for 
Memory and Aging; he is serving as the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_37105].  [CONTACT_535974] has obtained 
support from [CONTACT_535975], chair of orthopedics  and has engaged two orthopedic clinicians, Dr s 
Scott Marston and Chad Myeroff , to include his patients in this investigation.    
A common concern expressed by [CONTACT_535973] -operative cognitive decline.   
Neurology has a department goal of facilitating healthy cognitive aging in the Twin Cities population and 
limiting environmental exposures that could potentially hasten progression to dementia.  Furthermore, 
the HealthPartners orthopedics department is c ommitted to reducing the risk of post -operative 
complications, including delirium and progressive cognitive impairment.  
6. Risks and Benefits   
Risks associated with the study include uncovering evidence of undetected cognitive impairment, which may be upsetting to the patient and family.  At the same time, this information will be helpful in optimizing patient outcomes.  Furthermore, patients will undergo a blood test for NfL that may result in 
brief discomfort.   
Benefits of participating include the opportunity to obtain baseline cognitive testing results, which may 
better inform patients of current cognitive health.  Furthermore, those patients who do end up 
performing abnormally on the MOCA will be referred for additional diagnostic work -up for dementia.   
7. Data Confidentiality and Privacy  
Data will be stored on a secured server with restricted access to the project folder.  Participants will be            
identified by a study identification number.  Secure surveys will be conducted through RedCAP . Data 
from the CRFs and the cognitive assessment score sheets will be entered into a secure RedCap database.  
A participant tracking database will also be created in RedCap.  Neuroscience research study staff are 
experienced at building RedCap applications and using them for data entry and participa nt tracking.

9. Dissemination/Sharing Results /Integration and Impact  
Results from this investigation will be shared during department meetings for neurology and orthopedic 
surgery, respectively.  Furthermore, a presentation will be performed for the Regions HLT meeting as 
this was a Red -funded grant.  Efforts will be made to discus s findings with Park Nicollet neurology and 
orthopedic departments if it is determined from this study that certain pre -surgical factors are 
predictive of post -operative cognitive dysfunction.   
For external communication, [CONTACT_290314] and his team attend annual neurology meetings that include the American Academy of Neurology as well as the Alzheimer’s Association International 
Conference.  [CONTACT_535974] and colleagues attend annual orthopaedic meetings that include the American 
Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons as well as the American Orthopaedic Association. There are plans to 
submit these results for a poster/oral session at each of these meetings.  
Finally, our plan is to eventually submit a manuscript documenting our findings relating demographic risk factors and NfL levels to post -operative cognitive dysfunction.  Hopefully, this publication will 
support our application for a larger, NIH grant for the  study of a larger cohort of surgical patients and 
potential interventions for post -operative cognitive dysfunction.

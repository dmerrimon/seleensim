1.  SPECIFIC AIMS.  Asthma  is the number one cause of pediatric emergency department (ED) visits in 
young children  (1-4) and has a substantial impact on healthcare costs .(5-7) Repeated  ED visits for asthma 
care are not only costly but are an  index of poorly  controlled asthma.(8) The ED  is often the point of contact 
[CONTACT_329995]-income children (8,9) with many families view ing the ED as their primary  source of asthma care . (10)  
In fact, there has been a recent decline in primary care outpatient visits  for asthma .(2)  Unfortunately, l ow-
income and minority children suffer  the greatest morbidity  from asthma  and have the highest ED 
utilization ,(11) yet are less likely to receive adequate preventive therapy  and are more frequently exposed to 
environmental triggers  compared to  non-poor children.(3,12 -20) Low-income minority children with asthma 
receive suboptimal guideline based care partly due to lack of access to specialty care ,(14,15,22) lack of follow -
up with their primary care provider (PCP) after ED visits, (10, 2 4, 25 -29) and/or insufficient delivery of guideline 
based care  in the primary care office (i.e. no spi[INVESTIGATOR_329964]).(30-32)  Essential guideline 
recommendations  for preventive asthma care include : assessment of asthma severity  and ongoing control, 
appropriate prescri ption of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), counseling regarding avoidance of allergen and 
irritant exposures , delivery of asthma action plans , scheduling follow -up asthma visits , and provision of 
self-management education. (21) Howeve r, these recommendations are unlikely to be delivered in the 
context of  an acute ED asthma visit.(22)  New models of care are needed to transition  care for young 
minority children from the ED to primary care who are unlikely to follow -up in primary or spec ialty care 
clinics so that they may receive guideline -based care.  
 Our prior asthma  communication intervention included a PCP and caregiver  feedback  intervention  
targeting children with frequent asthma ED visits  and demonstrated in crease d preventive medica tion 
adherence , (25, 33-34) but no change in PCP follow -up rates. We also detected exposure to high levels of 
second hand smoke (SHS)  and other environmental triggers , yet these children had low rates of specialty 
care. (23,25, 33 -36) To address these challenges , we adapted and pi[INVESTIGATOR_31219] a program to provide optimal follow -
up for these high -risk children in the ED setting  and 3 -5 days after  index ED visit ,(37) that it is accessible  for 
families  to attend  and added collection of biomarkers of SHS and allergy, a home environmental control 
component and use of feedback  communicat ion with PCPs and caregivers.  Our pi[INVESTIGATOR_329965]  a single  ED follow -up visit , participat ion in the home environmental component  and use of 
feedback communication.  
 The over-riding goal of the Asthma Express (AEx)  study is to build upon our prior work by [CONTACT_329996] a behavioral intervention that links emergency, primary and home based care to provide 
coordinated preventive care for children with frequent asthma ED visits in order  to reduce asthma 
morbidity, subsequent ED visits and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]. The AEx intervention includes (1) collection of 
biomarkers of SHS exposure and allergen sensitivity during the index  asthma ED visit,(2) a follow -up visit 
in the ED setting for a  “mini -specialist” evaluation  within   5 days of the index ED visit to include a)  asthma 
evaluation and education, b) prescription and/or adjustment of ICS medication , c) review of allergy and 
cotinine results , d) provision of  an asthma action plan, ( 3) delivery of a home  visit within 2 weeks of index 
ED visit to deliver environmental control program tailored to the child’s allergy and cotinine results,  (4) 
communication with PCP and caregiver via “feedback letters” including allergy , cotinine , pharmacy refill 
results  with guideline based recommendations and (5) scheduling a PCP appointment  for asthma follow -
up. The AEx intervention  will be compared to an attention control ( CON ) group  receiving only asthma 
education .  
Specific Aims of the study are:   
Aim 1.  To reduce asthma morbidity  defined as number of symptom days and nights  (primary outcome),  
missed school days and caregiver work absences  due to asthma, ED visits and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_329966] (QOL ) and  impro ved child asthma control.  H 1. Children in the AEx 
intervention group will experience  significantly higher symptom free days/nights  (primary outcome)  and

have decreased  work days missed and increased QOL compared to children /caregivers assigned to the

2. RESEARCH STRATEGY  
2.A. SIGNIFICANCE  
Rationale for targeting young minority children with frequent ED visits .  Asthma affects 7.1 million US 
children and is the number one cause of pediatric emergency department (ED) visits. (1-4, 38) Children with 
frequent ED visits are at the greatest risk for life -threatening asthma, decreased quality of life and increased 
school absences . (39-42) Most cases of chronic asthma begin in preschool years.(43) Low-income, African 
American children have 4.1 times higher ED visits and a death rate 7.6 times higher than rates of non -
Hispanic white children . (3)   Despi[INVESTIGATOR_329967] , (11,44) 
minority low -income children are the least likely to receive adequate guideline based therapy , (12,13,4 5)  and 
specialty care  for asthma . (14,15, 23,34)   
Preventive  Asthma Management :  Expert Panel Report (EPR - 3) Guidelines Implementation (8,21) 
Airway inflammation is a key component of asthma.(8,21) Inflammation and airway remodeling can occur 
early in asthma and may lead to long -term loss of lung function and impairment.(46) The cornerstone of 
preventive care is regular use of anti -inflammatory medications, including inhaled  corticosteroids(ICS) that 
modify several components of the inflammatory process including the generation of cytokines, recruitment 
of airw ay eosinophils and release of inflammatory mediators. (46-49) Anti-inflammatory medications, including 
inhaled corticosteroids (ICS),  are the most effective medications to help establish long -term control of 
asthma (8, 49-50) and reduce ED visits and exacerbations.(51)  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_329968], under -
utilization of ICS remains high in underserved children with asthma (12, 5 2-54) with < 50% of children 
presenting to an ED for asthma taking an ICS. (51,55)  Additional critical  guideline -based preventive measures 
for asthma control include initial assessment of asthma severity, ongoing assessment of asthma control, 
environmental control education , home remediation for allergen and irritant exposures, use of asthma action 
plans and planned follow -up asthma visits. (21)  However, provision 
of preventive asthma care is striking low in minority children . Only 
31% receiv e preventive medication, 23% are seen by a specialist , 
44% receive  a written asthma action plan  and only half (50.6%) 
receive advice  regarding environment al control .(56) Access to 
specialty care has been associated with long-term control of asthma  
resulting in  decreased asthma morbidity  and ED visits  (57) and 
increased quality of life,  (5,8,22, 56,58-59) yet access  for poor children  is 
low.(56) 
Gap in linking ED to Primary Care for Children with Asthma  The 
ED is often the point of contact [CONTACT_329998]  (26-27) 
for both acute and chronic asthma management. (60) Although 
national asthma guidelines recommend f ollow -up after an ED 
asthma visit within 1 to 4 weeks with a primary care provider , (8) 
adherence to follow -up care after an ED visit is striking low  
particularly among  high risk inner city  populations . (10, 23, 2 7) This 
results in a “missed opportunity” for children to receive preventive 
medications . (28,49,61) Only 60% of inner city children with persistent Legend

asthma received adequate ICS pharmacy fills, yet had  a mean of 1.8 ED visits over a 12 month period  in 
our prior data . (25, 52)  ED physicians /health care providers  commonly do not prescribe ICS medications  (62) 
nor evaluate environmental exposures  during the ED visit due to belief that this is the role of the PCP or 
asthma specialist.(22)  Yet prior studies indicate that only 5 2-56% of young inner -city children were evaluated 
by [CONTACT_329999] 1 month following  an ED asthma visit  or us ed preventive asthma medication . (63-64) 
Several ED -based interventions  to improve primary care follow -up have  been tested. Children who received  
allergy skin testing with results  during an asthma ED visit w ere 2.6 times more likely to keep an asthma 
clinic appointment than non -tested children ( 95% CI 1.02 -6.65).(65)  In a randomized controlled trial of 433 
children attending an ED asthma  visit, intervention p arent s viewed a video during the ED visit that 
addressed beliefs and barriers to follow -up primary asthma care  plus received  a letter about the  ED visit 
care of the child to be deliver ed to the child’s PCP and a reminder call about the PCP visit as compared to 
controls who were reminded to follow -up with their child’s PCP.  (66) Notably, m edian time to PCP follow -up 
was 38 days in both groups and rate of PCP follow -up at 4 weeks did not differ between groups  (INT: 
44.5%; C ON: 43.8%) .(66) Initiation of ICS medication during an asthma ED visit plus a call to the child’s PCP 
to obtain approval of the medication and faxing a letter with the proposed treatment plan, resulted in a 70% 
PCP follow -up rate in a convenience sample of children with persistent asthma who were not previously 
prescribed ICS medications.(67)  An ED-based  educational computer intervention with a tailored component 
based on family/child needs plus receipt of an asthma action plan and a PCP appointment reminder call as 
compared to usual care  resulted in intervention children more likely to attend a primary care asthma visit at 
9 months (OR 1.85; 95%CI:1.05 -3.39) than control children, yet the follow -up rate remained low (40 -52%). 
(68) Additional strategies to link ED to primary care for children with asthma have demonstrated limited 
success such as scheduling a PCP follow -up during the ED visit,(64) reminder phone calls for PCP 
appointments, identifying a new PCP if the child is not linked to a PCP, and facilitating child care and 
transpo rtation to the PCP.(69-71)  Even  using an asthma coach during an ED visit combined with a $15.00 
incentive to adhere with a PCP appointment failed to increase PCP follow -up rates after the index ED 
visit.(72) These studies  suggest that a more intensive ED-based intervention , i.e. providing a mini “specialty 
care” follow -up visit may result in a larger impact on linking ED to  preventive asthma care for children with 
frequent ED visits.  
 Why Link Home -based Environmental Control into ED-based interventions ?  Asthma  morbidity is 
often a result of interactions between genes and environments .(73, 74) Low-income children are more 
frequently exposed to environmental triggers than non -poor children (16-20) including high levels of indoor 
allergens(75) and SHS.(23,35 ) Allergen sensitivity and exposure are associated with increased asthma 
morbidity, particularly in sensitized individuals with asthma. (76) In general, 60-79% of children and young 
adults with asthma test positive for  at least one airborne allergen  (77) yet in a recent study conducting skin 
testing during asthma ED visits, 100% of children reacted to at least 1 allergen.(65) Modifying the indoor 
environment to reduce particulate matter, allergen exposures and nitrogen dioxide  is suggested  to reduce 
asthma  morbidity (78,79) however many studies are inconclusive.  Exposure to allergens and irritants is high 
in inner city children due to substandard housing  conditions that results in expos ure to high cockroach and 
mouse allergen levels  (16,80,81 ) and increased time spent indoors due to neighborhood violence.   Moreover,  
40-67% of inner -city children with asthma reside  with at least one smoker . (16,23,82,83) These exposures are 
associated with asthma exacerbations and ED use.  (75) Almost half (45%) of families in our current study 
(NR010546) reported mice  and 28% cockroach infestation in their homes , yet only 33% reported knowing if 
their children had r eceived allergy testing . Receipt of s pecialty care by [CONTACT_330000], hospi[INVESTIGATOR_329969] (53) however, poor 
and minority children with persistent asthma are less likely to receive specialty care  than non -poor white 
children  (14,15 ) and is strikingly low for Baltimore children at 19-24%.  (31,33-34) Intensive environmental control 
education and home remediation is one major component of asthma specialty care for children .(84)  Few 
inner -city children receive the benefit of environmental interventions based on their sensitization and 
exposure profiles.(65) Thus, multifaceted , individualized intervention s that link the emerg ency, primary 
care and the home environment  are needed to reduc e asthm a morbidity  and high health care cost  in 
children  with frequent ED visits for asthma .   
 
Impact .  Asthma is the number one cause of pediatric ED visits, yet adherence to preventive care is low at 
22-56% posing a serious public health problem . Because t he ED often is the primary point of contact [CONTACT_330001]:  Bridging the Emergency to Primary Care in Underserved Children                          PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_329963], Arlene  
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
 
urban children with asthma (26) for both acute and chronic asthma management , (60) bridging the gap 
between the ED, primary care  and the home environment  is paramount to reducing asthma morbidity.  Prior 
childhood asthma ED -based interventions have reduced unscheduled visits (37) yet few have improved 
adherence to scheduled PCP visits for preventive care or addressed environmental control.  Linking 
emergency, primary and home -based  care to provide early preventive care  in children with frequent 
ED visits for asthma  to reduce asthma morbidity and healthcare costs is significant , innovative  and 
is consistent with current guideline recommendations for asthma care .   
 
2.B  INNOVATION :  The project’s innovative strategies include: (1)  initiating preventive asthma care 
immediately following an asthma ED visit  in an accessible location (ED) , (2) use of biomarkers  collected 
during ED visit  to identify the child’s allergen and SHS exposure profil e, (3) provid ing a “mini -specialist” 
clinic visit  at ED follow -up (allergy, cotinine and spi[INVESTIGATOR_329970] ) conducted 
by [CONTACT_330002]-time allergy and pulmonology consultation  and (4) providing a home visit  
component  for in dividualized environmental control education and remediation based on allergen and SHS 
biomarker  results  collected during ED visit. The AEx model is designed to be accessible, guideline -based, 
easily replicated  and incorporated into ED car e. The AEx intervention is translatable across settings, i.e. 
rural, community -based, non -academic health centers since the intervention is staffed by [CONTACT_174520] s and nurse  
practitioner s with access to specialty consultation, use standardized forms ( national guidelines, asthma 
action plans, asthma control tests ) and use tests  (Spi[INVESTIGATOR_038], RAST)  and environmental control products  
(mouse traps, mattress encasings)  that are  widely  available and used outside major health center s. 
2.C. Public Health Impact :  Recent studies of inner -city children with asthma indicate that o nly 22 -56% of 
children attending an ED for acute asthma exacerbations receive follow -up care for asthma .(66,85)  The 
results of this study are likely to result in offering patients and insurers a bridge between ED acute care, 
primary preventive care  and home environmental control . This bridge will provide several components of 
intensive  asthma care to inform ongoing preventive care by  [CONTACT_330003] , recommendations whether to modify ICS medications when 
appropriate and implementing targeted environmental control remediation  in the home .  This proposal will 
provide rigorous data on the efficac y of the AEx intervention worthy of insurers review for use in EDs for 
children with asthma.  
 
2.D. Conceptual  Framework  based on  Wagner Chronic Care Model and Patient Centered Care  
The framework for this study was adapted from Chronic Care Model (CCM) (86-89) and patient centered 
care.(87) The CCM is a primary care based framework aimed at improving care of patients with chronic 
disease(86-89) and promotes  productive interactions between  providers and  patients.(90) Because th e Asthma 
Express  intervention involves a delivery system change , i.e. ED -based asthma follow -up  and community 
linkage and resources we chose the Chronic Care Model . Core e lements of the CCM include the health 
care system  (organization /leadership , delivery system design, clinical infor mation systems, provider 
decision support ) and the community elements of self-management support, and community linkage & 
resources. The CCM model (Figure 1) demonstrates that the health  care system exists within the larger  
community  (dark circle) that inc ludes community resources and self -management support.

Our current Pediatric Asthma Alert (PAAL)  intervention target s Provider Decision Support, Clinical 
Information Systems, Community Linkage and Resources and Caregiver & Patient Self-Management 
Support  in the model  (small dotted line) . The AEx (dashed lines) adds the Delivery System Design  and 
strengthen s the Community Linkage and Resources . Under t he Delivery system design , the ED -based 
follow -up visit , includes a  “mini -specialist” visit  and links the child’s ED care to the child’s PCP  and the 
home.   We will electronic ally relay the child’s  medical asthma information to the child’s PCP ( clinical 
information system ) to enhance  provider decision support  to implement guideline based care . The home -
based environmental control  component , targeting  the child’s allergy and cotinine results , provides linkage 
to community resources ; the Baltimore City Health Department for free smoking cessation programs , rat 
control  and housing services   . Both the  self-management and provider decision support activities are 
strong determinants of health outcomes (87) and remain  strong components of the AEx. The CCM is 
fundamentally concordant with patient centered care  and is tailored to patient pref erences, values, 
readiness and incorporat es prevention in asthma care. (87, 91)  The outcomes may be moderated or mediated 
by [CONTACT_330004], depressive symptomatology and stress, and 
child age, asthma severity  and control , SHS exposure and allergy status .  
 
2.E. Preliminary  Studies .  This propos al describes an ambitious project led by a highly experienced, 
multidisciplinary team  (Butz, Bollinger, Frick, Kub, Ogborn  and Tsoukleris ) who have worked together on 
multiple  projects addressing  high risk children with asthma during the past 12 years. Drs. Mudd, Oeklo and 
Teach comp lement the team with expertise in ED-nursing, pulmonology  and ED-based  intervention s.  
2.E.1.  Predictors of frequent ED use and underuse of Inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) medication . (Butz -
P.I.) Our prior studies had demonstrated that h igh rescue medication use and high caregiver depressive 
symptoms are associated with frequent ED utilization. In our study of 221 young minority children with 
asthma  using a nebulizer  (Nebulizer Education  study, NR05060) , high rescue  medication use (poor asthma 
control)  was associated with increased ED use (p=0.04)  (52)  Further,  children enrolled in an asthma 
communication study (ACE NR008544) with high rescue medication  use were 2.[ADDRESS_407744] 
a caregiver report ing high depressive symptoms  (92)  that may  impair the caregiver’s home management of 
their child’s asthma  resulting in ED utilization . Underuse of anti -inflammatory medications has been a 
consistent  finding  in our studies . Only 20% of children with persistent asthma  received appropriate controller   Community

medication refills  (> 6 ICS refills/12 months ) at baseline , yet most children had > 2 PCP visits /opportunities  
to receive anti-inflammatory  medication .(25,52) In our PCP and caregiver feedback intervention  study of 300 
minority children with persistent asthma, mean ICS fills /12 months for all participants were low  at baseline: 
4.3 (SD 4.0)  despi[INVESTIGATOR_329971] ( SABA ) use of 3.8 fills/12 months  (PAAL 
NR010546) . This suggests ICS underuse and poorly controlled asthma based on SABA use.  At 12 months 
follow -up, mean ICS fills  did not differ  by [CONTACT_19313] (INT: 4.1 fills (SD4.) : CON: 4.0 fills  SD4.4,  p=0.90). In the 
same study , mean ICS fills were not associated with distance to pharmacy  although families using one 
pharmacy had the highest mean ICS fills (3.0, SD2.7). (93)  Caregiver stress and depressive symptoms may 
be other  predictor s of frequent ED use.  In the PAAL study, c aregivers  encounter ed multiple  life stressors  
that may  decrease their capacity to appropriately manage their child’s asthma  resulting in ED use.  (94) 
(APPENDIX B -Bellin ) Common caregiver stresses  were  threat of utilities/phone cut of f (51%), rats, mice, or 
insects in the home (49%) and neighborhood violence  (38%). (94) 
 
2.E.2. Emergency Department -Based Randomized Trial to Improve Asthma Outcomes in High 
Morbidity Pediatric Population .  IMPACT -DC (Teach -P.I.) To test the effectiveness of a single follow -up 
visit in the ED following an acute asthma exacerbation  treated in the ED, 490 children were randomized into 
2 groups: Control  (CON)  or standard care (n=244) versus Intervention  (INT)  of a single follow -up visits in the 
ED (n=244) .(37)  This ED based intervention  focus ed on asthma self -monitoring and education  regarding 
management, environmental modification and trigger control with linkages and referrals to preventive  care. 
Within the  INT group  172/244 (70.5%) attended the follow -up ED visit.  At 6 months, the INT group had a 
significantly higher percent of IC S use in the prior 2 days  (INT: 49.3% vs. CON: 26.5%, RR=2.03) and 
significantly fewer mean unscheduled visits for asthma (INT: 1.39, CON:  2.34, RR=0.60).(37) The AEx 
intervention  builds on the IMPACT -DC model  with the addition of (1) collection of allergen  (RAST)  and 
cotinine  biomarkers  at index ED visit , (2) PCP and caregiver feedback including  RAST and cotinine results 
and ( 3) a home environmental control component  individualized for  the child’s  allergen and cotinine results.  
 
 2.E.3.  Feedback/Pr ompting of child health information to PCPs and parent s. (PAAL, NR010546),  
(Butz -P.I.). In our recently completed  PCP and caregiver feedback  study of 300 young children with 
frequent asthma ED visits , intervention children (INT) had a nurse prompt the ir PCP to prescribe  an ICS 
medication when indicated and communicate  cotinine  levels and pharmacy fill data  to the PCP via feedback 
letter . Outcomes were compared with an attention control group (CON).  At 6 months, m edication adherence 
was significantly higher in the INT group (High adherence: INT: 89.6%, CON: 81.4%; X2 =3.82, p=0.05)  and 
INT children reported significantly higher asthma control based on days of wheezing over past 4 weeks  (< 3 
days  wheezing  for asthma control :  INT: 64%, CON: 57% (p=0.04) .  However, mean ED visits, symptom 
days or ,number of routine PCP asthma visit s did not differ by [CONTACT_330005]  6 or 12 months (Fig 2 -3) At baseline, 
the overall mean number of symptoms days/past two weeks was 7.24 (SD 5.31) and decreased to 4.34 (SD 
4.69) at 6 months and 4.53 (SD 5.0) at 12 months.  Mean number of PCP asthma visits decreased from 2.7 
at baseline to 1.7 at 12 months with no difference by [CONTACT_19313] (Fig 4).

plan (OR: 3.0, CI 1.2 ,7.5) and lower caregiver daily asthma stress (OR: 0.89, CI 0.79 ,1.0) were significantly 
associated with completion of a PCP visit  in regression analysis , while adjusting for medication adherence, 
caregiver depression and controller medication use.  Lessons learned from  PAAL : 1) caregivers of older 
children need accessible hours for follow -up, i.e., after school  and weekends , 2) high caregiver stress  is a 
marker of poor follow -up; and  3) lack of asthma action plan may be marker of poor preventive care . Asthma Fig. 2  Fig. 3  Fig. 4

2.E.4.  Identifying the burden of SHS and measuring SHS exposure in urban children with asthma . 
(Particulate Reduction Education in Childhood Asthma study EPA: P01 R -826724/NIEHS:E09606)  
and PAAL feedback study (NR010546) (Butz -P.I.) In a randomized 3 -arm controlled trial we examined  the 
efficacy of an air cleaner  and health coach intervention in  reducing particulate matter in homes of children 
with persistent asthma and who resided with a smoker.(36) Results showed that particulate matter  (PM)  2.5 
levels were high (Mean PM  2.5: 30.7 µg/m3 (standard : < 15 µg/m3) in homes of  study children  living with a 
smoker . Caregiver s were the primary smoker (68% ); smoking occurred primarily in family room (50 %) and 
caregiver bedroom ( 46%). (35,36) High SHS exposure was also noted in the PAAL study  with positive sa livary 
cotinine level  (>1.0 ng/ml)  detected in 60% children at baseline(23) and 56% at 12 months . No difference in 
mean cotinine level by [CONTACT_330007].  CON  group were detected at 6 or 12 months . The child’s caregiver and 
spouse were the predominant smokers in the home (70%) and younger children (3 -5 years) had 
significantly higher cotinine levels than older children even with a total home smoking ban .(23)These findings 
support t he home environmental control component of the  AEx  intervention to coach caregivers how to  
institute  a total home s moking ban . (36)   
2.E.5.  Cost Effectiveness Analysis . (Butz -P.I.) Prior cost effectiveness analysis conducted in the Asthma 
Communication Education study ( ACE, NR008544) demonstrated no cost-saving of the intervention.  (Table 
1). Costs were measured f rom the perspective of the health care payer and the patient . The increased 
pharmacy cost in the intervention group is most likely related to increase controller medication fills . Although 
the intervention group had higher expenses in ph armacy, ED and inpatient costs, all differences were  not 
significant by [CONTACT_19313] (p >0.05 for all comparisons). High SDs reflect high utilization in subgroup of chil dren.

2.E.6.  Asthma Express (AE x) Pi[INVESTIGATOR_16116] . (Butz -P.I.) A total of 32  out of 58 eligible  children  were  
recruited and enrolled  in the Asthma Express pi[INVESTIGATOR_52393] (INT) study during their asthma ED visit . The 
original pi[INVESTIGATOR_329972] [ADDRESS_407748] the full intervention. A separate 
group of 25 historical control  children  (CON)  were  matched for child age, race and date of ED visit . Data for 
CON children were abstracted from medical records using a HIPAA waiver approved by [CONTACT_330008], hospi[INVESTIGATOR_329973] 2 month follow -up period . Children 
were primarily  male ( 67%), African American ( 97%), Medicaid insured (9 7%) and young ( mean age 5.7  
years ). Morbidity was high  in INT  group ; mean symptom days and nights/ past 30 days  were days:  
8.63(SD9.2) and nights : 9.78(SD 10. 6).  Many  (38%) reported daily use of albuterol over the last 4 weeks  
indicating poor asthma control . At baseline, INT c hildren had a m ean of 2.2 (SD 3.6) ED visits during the 
last 12 months , yet 38% reported no PCP visits over p ast 6 months.  Attendance at the pi[INVESTIGATOR_329974] 72% (23/32) and most attend ed the  AEx clinic within 6 days of the index ED visit.  Overall 
81% of children received an AEx visit or one home visit indicating high  delivery of the AEx intervention.   
During the AE x visit 25% children had diffuse expi[INVESTIGATOR_329975] e but none required acute ED treatment. 
Mean baseline cotinine levels were high at 2.02  ug/ml,  (SD1.9)  and (58%) had cotinine levels > 1.0 ug/ml 
indicative of SHS exposure . 80% of children  who had at least one positive RAST test , consistent with  the 
78% previously reported in other inner -city population s.(77, 95) Common positive  RAST  tests were  dog ( 72%), 
cat (6 4%), oak tree (5 6%), house dust mite (52%), cockroach (5 0%), and mouse ( 45%). Spi[INVESTIGATOR_329976] 42% of children ; young age precluded  collection of spi[INVESTIGATOR_329977] 58% . 
Problem indoor exposures  noted on home visits were person smok ing during nurse visit (35%), dustmite 
problem (43%), mouse droppi[INVESTIGATOR_14839] + cockroaches (42%), and any evidence of mouse in home (50%) . One -
third of homes  had a cat to control a mouse problem.  At the 2 month follow -up 50% of INT children reduced 
their positive cotinine level  (> 1.0) to negative  level (<1.0) although this was not significant (X2=1.53, p=0.2) . 
INT children were more likely to have a PCP visit  than CON children  (INT:  54%; CON: 40%, p=0.32 ) and 
less likely to have  an ED visit over the 2 month follow -up (INT:  16%; CON:  32%, p=0 .16) yet both were not 
statistically significant . A trend was noted w ith more INT children reporting asthma  is control led over the

3.0  APPROACH : DESIGN and MET HODS  
Overall Design: The proposed study  is a two -group randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate the 
efficacy of a  multifaceted  ED-based asthma intervention  to reduce asthma morbidity and subsequent 
asthma ED visits , increase appropriate anti -inflammatory medication use and reduce cost care or be cost 
neutral.  We will consent and enroll [ADDRESS_407749] > [ADDRESS_407750] 12 months . Caregivers are consented in  the Johns 
Hopkins Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_329979] (JHH PED)  during the child’s asthma ED visit . Once consented, all children 
receive allergy testing (RAST test -5 ml blood) and cotinine concentration measurement (1 ml saliva) and 
then randomiz ed to either the AEx or attention control ( CON ) group using a block design and stratified by 
[CONTACT_330009] [ADDRESS_407751] demographic, asthma health, medication use, 
maternal caregiver depression , QOL  and stress, smoking characteristic s of the household  data. 
(APPENDIX C) Subjects will be remunerated at $30.00 for baseline, 6 and 12 months and $10.00 for each  3 
and 9 month survey.  A home inspection of indoor environmental  exposures for data purposes only, will be  
collected at baseline and 12 months  by [CONTACT_330010] . (APPENDIX D).  The AE x intervention  consists 
of one ED follow -up visit  and two home visits by [CONTACT_330011] 8 weeks . For families who 
relocate over the 8 week intervention, an additional  home visit will be conducted in the new location. The 
CON group receives 3 home visits for basic asthma education  over 8 week s as an attention control  and the 
caregiver and PCP  receive the child’s RAST and cotini ne results after completion of CON visits. (Figure 5)

Sampling Design : The sample population will include  264 children  with persistent asthma and > [ADDRESS_407752] 12 months and their  caregiver .  In 20 11, the pediatric 
population served by [CONTACT_941] J HH PED  was 89% African American and Medicaid insured (87%). We anticipate 
few Hispanic families to be eligible for this study in that persons of Hispanic origin accounted for only 4.2% 
of Baltimore residents in 20 10. (96)  If a Hispanic child has an asthma ED vi sit they will be recruited .  The 
JHH PED,  a new 34  bed ED  unit, has over 26,600 visits per year.  In 201 1, there were 11,069 visits for 
children aged 3 -12 years  and 1545  patients aged 3 -12 years  were treated for asthma and wheezing (code 
493.9, 493.91, 493.92, 786.07) at the J HH PED .  Of the  1545 patients , 263 had > [ADDRESS_407753] 12 months (n=10)  for total n=273 . We anticipate a 50% recruitment rate based on our 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_329980] 137 children age 3 -12 years per year or 411 children  over the 3 year recruitment period. This 
is more than sufficient to meet our sample size of 264 children  (n=132 per group). Figure 6.

Recruitment Procedures . We will recruit interested families of children wi th acute asthma using our prior 
HIPAA approved protocol  for daily review of the  JHH PEDS -ED census board for children with asthma .  [CONTACT_330028] , JHH PEDS ED attending physician or her alternate  will seek permission  from the child’s caregiver 
to allow the master’s prepared research assistant ( RA) to discuss the study  with the caregiver during the 
PEDS ED visit . We have budgeted for recruitment at 16/[ADDRESS_407755] children to resolve an acute asthma  exacerbation , we will be able 
to recruit children arriving to the ED after 12:00AM during the following morning.  If the parent agrees, the 
RA will explain the study, obtain informed consent, collect blood (RAST for allergy testin g) and saliva  
(cotinine testing ) from the child , administer the baseline interview, randomize each child to the AEx or CON 
group. For parents who refuse blood drawing in the PEDS ED, they  will be provided an option to return the 
next day to the JHH patholo gy lab for drawing of the child’s blood. In the PEDS ED, t he RA will open a 
sealed randomization envelope . Caregiver s and children randomized to the AEx group will receive an 
appointment to the AEx visit (within 3 -5 days)  (APPENDIX  E). Children randomized to CON will receive an 
appointment for the community home asthma nurse to conduct  the CON  home visit s. We achieved a 55% 
enrollment rate  and a 79% rate of  blood draw during the AEx pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] .  
 
Randomization:   We will stratify the randomization for ages 3 -6 (preschool) and 7-12 years (school age)  to 
ensure comparable groups by [CONTACT_654].  Age stratification  has been included in the sample size calculation .  
Since enrollment and randomization will occur over an extended time period, a permu tated block design will 
be used to assure an equal balance of children in each age group for each seasonal time period. Using 
computer generated list of random digits, [CONTACT_194605] will develop the randomization scheme and 
prepare randomization cards in sealed opaque envelopes  and sequentially numbered  for use by [CONTACT_330012]. Following completion of the baseline survey , each child will be randomly assigned to the AEx 
or CON  group  using the randomiz ation cards in the  numbered envelopes . [CONTACT_330029] , co-investigators  and 
interviewers will be blinded to group assignment . 
Interventions .  All children (AEx and CON) receive allergy and cotinine testing during their index ED visit.  
 (AEx)  Intervention : consists of five components  addressing the six asthma guideline  based priori ties:(21)  
(1) A “mini -specialist” follow -up visit within  3-5 days after index ED asthma visit  delivered at  the JHH PEDS 
ED by a pediatric nurse practitioner  (PNP)  with asthma expertise . This short clinic visit , scheduled in late 
afternoon  or weekends to accommodate family schedules , will provide symptom monitoring,  spi[INVESTIGATOR_329982] > 6 years of age , specialized asthma education and an asthma action plan . (APPENDIX F)   A 
prescription will be written  for children without an ICS prescription  and the medication delivered to the home 
by [CONTACT_330013] . In children with asthma 
enrolled in school based asthma intervention , 70% had asthma  medicatio ns delivered to both home and 
school(97)  to reduce barrier s to medication adherence. Medication v ouchers will be provided to children with 
no health insurance . Specialized Asthma Education (device training, peak flow meter use, appropriate 
medication use  and adherence) will be conducted with the parent and the child when developmentally 
appropriate.  Asthma action plans will be reviewed and provided to the parent . Referrals for asthma special ty 
care will be made  based on guideline criteria , i.e. severe ast hma epi[INVESTIGATOR_329983].  
Child’s digital photo will be taken for inclusion on feedback letters. (Guideline Priority : Inhaled 
corticosteroids,  Asthma Action Plan, Assessment of asthma severity, Assessment of asthma control ).  
(2) Delivery of a home e nvironmental control program individualized  to child’s allergy and cotinine results  
delivered during [ADDRESS_407756] management  (IPM)  and will conduct  
specific i ntegrative pest management (IPM) practices  in homes with  identified rodent  and cockroach

infestations .  He will refer  families  to appropriate community resources, i.e.  alternative housing , rat control .  
During the home visit, families  will receive green cleaning supplies, kitchen trash can + trash bags, mattress 
covers,  and IPM supplies (roach baits, m ouse  traps)  based on the child’s RAST results  and home 
assessment .  For children with cotinine levels >1.0, indicating SHS exposure,  the AEx home nurse will 
provide  counseling using a “ health coach ” protocol  to institute a total home smoking ban . (36,96-98)  A 
motivational ladder  and contingency contract will be used (APPENDIX G, Home visit protocol forms ). 
Additionally,  a “Safe Zone” will be identified and taped off for smoking  outside of the home.  Health coach 
interventions are effective in reducing SHS exposure in homes of children (36, 98-102) and enhance medication 
adherence in adolescents with asthma.(103)  Children with negative RAST and cotinine results ( expected < 
10%) will still receive home visits for  preventive environmental control education.  (Guideline Priority: 
Avoidance of allergen and irritant exposure ) 
(3) PCP “ Feedback letter ” (APPENDIX H) electronically sent and faxed  to child’s PCP that includes child’s 
allergy and cotinine results, number of ED visits past 6 months, medication and peak flow meter device 
technique, pharmacy data for number of ICS and SABA fills, asthma control level , spi[INVESTIGATOR_329984] > 6 years, and environmental control procedures implemented in the home .  The letter provide s the 
PCP with guideline based recommendations for management including initiation or modification  (step -up, 
step down)  of ICS medication dose if indicated.   Feedback letters will be reviewed /signed by [INVESTIGATOR_124] s. Bollinger  
and Butz.  (Guideline Priority : Assessment of asthma severity and asthma control,  Inhaled corticosteroids )  
(4) Parent “feedback letter ” (APPENDIX H) with allergy and cotinine results  and recommendations for each 
positive allergen and home remediation of SHS exposure  delivered by [CONTACT_330014] 2 home visits.  
(Guideline Priority : avoidance of  allergen and irritant exposure ) and  
(5) A Scheduled appointment with child’s PCP made during the AEx visit  linking the child to ongoing PCP 
care. If the  AEx -PNP is unable to schedule an appointment during AEx visit, the PNP will schedule a PCP 
appointment the next day and c all the parent with appointment date / time.  Text or phone reminders for PCP 
visit will be conducted by [CONTACT_330015] . (Guideline Priority : planned follow -up visits ).  
Attention Control (CON) Intervention  consists of  [ADDRESS_407757] asthma education 
received at a PCP visit and  consistent with the NAEPP guidelines.(8) (APPENDIX I) Specific  content of CON 
visits: 1) pathophysiology of asthma , 2 ) use of rescue and controller medications , and 3) importance of 
preventive asthma follow -up with PCP, but no scheduling of PCP visits . At the end of the 8 week CON 
intervention, each CON  family will receive a letter with their child’s allergy and cotinine results  and 
recommendations for avoidance of positive allergens. For children with baseline cotinine levels >1.0 ng/ml, 
the letter will include community resources for free smoking cessa tion programs. A copy of this letter will be 
sent to the child’s PCP if family request s.  Training and supervision of the CON  nurse will be conducted by

age strata)  in order to achieve a power of 90% to detect a 2.5 absolute difference in mean symptom days 
from baseline (7.25) to 6 months (4.5)  for the intervention group . Accounting for a 1 2% attrition rate, we plan 
to enroll [ADDRESS_407765] size 
of 0.2 1 (Cohen’s d =0.43)  for mean number symptom days /2 weeks  based on  PAAL baseline symptom data.

Data Analysis  for Hypothesis Testing    
Preliminary and Descriptive analyses . The data analysis will be performed using an intention -to-treat model . 
The major independent variable is the AEx Intervention ( AEx vs.CON ) and p rimary dependent variable  is 
the number of symptom days and/or nights  over p ast 14 days .  Secondary outcomes include  number of  ED 
visits and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] /last 6 months , and number  of anti -inflammatory medication refills /12 months, 
number of school days and work days missed , child asthma control and caregiver quality of life scores.   
Controller to total medication ratios will be calculated ba sed on 12 month pharmacy records.   Initia l data 
analyses will include exploratory inspection  using box plots to identify general relationships and potential 
problems with asymmetry  and extreme observations . Both groups ( AEx and CON ) will be examined for 
differences in baseline independent/covaria te variables i.e. child and maternal age, allergen status .  For 
initial confirmatory analyses, chi -square tests and t -tests will be used for categorical and continuous 
variables, respectively, in order to examine for statistical relationships between the dependent variables and 
treatment assignment.  The results of these univariate analyses will inform building multivariable regression 
models that will be created to statistically compare treatment groups for differences in number of  symptom 
days and/or nights,  ED visits , hospi[INVESTIGATOR_329987] -inflammatory medication while 
controlling for potential confounders including asthma control , allerg y status , cotinine level  and fidelity of the 
intervention defined as adherence to AEx visit (yes or no)  and number of intervention home visits .  A 
probab ility level of p <= 0.[ADDRESS_407766] for the  multiple comparisons from the large number of proposed t -tests on 
the same subjects under specific aim 1, we will use the Bonferroni adjustment to preserve the overall type I 
error for these several tests by [CONTACT_330020] (e.g. 0.05) by [CONTACT_330021]. Under 
specific aim 1,  we have pre-selected the following comparisons by [CONTACT_65237]: increased symptom 
free days and nights  (our primary outcome),  decreased ED visits, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_598], missed school and work 
days, and increased caregiver QOL  and child asthma control .  We will further adjust the alpha level to 
accommodate any additional tests that may prove to be clinically relevant under this specific aim.  
Analysis by [CONTACT_74205] 1.  To reduce asthma morbidity  defined as increase  number of symptom free days and nights 
(primary outcome),  decrease  missed school days and caregiver work absences due to asthma, ED visits 
and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_329988] (QOL) and child asthma control .  Student’s t -test for 
independent samples will be used to test for group differences ( AEx vs. CON ) in number of symptom free 
days and nights, ED and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_598], school days and caregiver worked days missed and caregiver 
quality of life scores.  These variables will also be examined over time (6 and 12 months follow -up) using 
appropriate regression modeling techniques for long itudinal data e.g. likelihood methods, mixed models, 
GEE.(119) 
Aim 2.  To improve the use of appropriate anti -inflammatory (controller) medication  (receiving > 6 
controller medication refills/12 months or achieve a controller -to-total (C -T) medication rati o >0.5) based on 
Asthma Express:  Bridging the Emergency to Primary Care in Underserved Children                          PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_329963], Arlene

national asthma guidelines. (8, 111 )  Student’s t -test for independent samples will be used to test for group 
differences ( AEx vs. CON ) in the number of anti -inflammatory refills over the 12 month study period.  We 
will also dichotomize the number of anti -inflammatory refills to <6 vs. > 6 refills  and C -T ratios < 0.5 versus > 
0.[ADDRESS_407767] this hypothesis. The anti -inflammatory refill rat es also will be examined over time (e.g. at baseline 
and 12 months) using appropriate regression modeling techniques for longitudinal data e.g. likelihood 
methods for mixed models, GEE.(120-122)   
Aim 3.  To compare the economic cost and effects of this intervention  using a societal and payer 
perspective cost -benefit analysis as the primary analyses .  Means, medians and standard deviations 
for the total costs including ED visits , hospi[INVESTIGATOR_329989], and the value of symptom days 
will be co mputed for each group (AE x and CON).   Current ED visit costs at Johns Hopkins are: $1196.49  
( Level 4 Professional fee and Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15680]). Predicted cost of AEx intervention  is $509 (ED follow -up visit 
@$198 P rofessional fee and Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15680]  + $[ADDRESS_407768]). To make a comparison of costs 
using bivariate and multivariate parametric techniques, we will conduct analyses that are either non -
parametric or that account for the distribution of the data if they are non -normal.  Since health care costs are 
often highly skewed , we expect to use a multivariate approach like the generalized linear model with a log 
link and the gamma family for the error distribution. Bivariate analyses such as t -tests  or analogous non -
parametric tes ts will be performed to examine any differences between the groups. In addition, we will 
perform multivariate analyses, such as the type described above  to control for independent or confounding 
variables that may modify a relationship between AEx interven tion group and health care costs. The cost -
saving and cost -effectiveness analyses will combine the medical care cost data described above with the 
data on the value of missed work days and data on the cost of the intervention.  Since data on missed work 
days and the resources used in the intervention can be linked to individuals, we are able to  calculate the 
total costs associated with care for each child in both groups and the analyses described earlier in the 
paragraph can be repeated. While it is possibl e to estimate the difference in costs and to compute a p -value 
for the difference being different from zero, using parametric techniques we will also bootstrap the results 
(i.e. take repeated sets of study data observations drawn from the data with replace ment) using natural (i.e. 
non-transformed) dollars.(123) The distribution of calculated differences will b e used to describe the 
probability of a cost -savings result.  The primary analysis will  be a cost -benefit analysis using the societal 
perspective (incl uding the costs of the intervention, symptom days, and ED visits and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]) and a 
cost-benefit analysis from the payer perspective (leaving out the indirect costs of the symptom days). If the 
AEx intervention is effective and the costs are higher, then it will be necessary to calculate an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio. If not, this secondary analysis does not need to be conducted. The point estimate 
for the incremental cost -effectiveness ratio is calcula ted as the difference in the average cost divided by [CONTACT_330022] ; this is useful on the assumption that there is a 
value to symptom free days that is not captured by [CONTACT_330023] . The precisi on of the ratio 
can be described using a cost -effectiveness acceptability curve (CEAC) that can be constructed after 
conducting a probabilistic sensitivity analysis.  The bootstrappi[INVESTIGATOR_329990] -savings.  At the end of each bootstrappi[INVESTIGATOR_329991], the incremental cost -effectiveness will be calculated. The CEAC uses data from multiple 
replications and a range of possible values of a  symptom free  day to summarize data on the probability of 
having a result that is above or below any given level of cost - effectiveness. The CEAC will be used to infer 
the likelihood of the ratio being below the $7 9.43/symptom free day reported in prior studies.(124)  Two other 
secondary ana lyses will include a cost -benefit analysis only from the payer perspective and a cost con - 
sequence analysis will describe all the cost components, symptom free days, school and work days missed . 
Additional Analyses .  Multivariate generalized linear regression models will be used to study the effects of 
the AEx treatment on child outcome measures while controlling for various independent variables, including 
both (i) variables hypothesized a priori to predict those outc omes and (ii) covariates found to be significantly 
associated in bivariate analyses.  These models will allow for interaction effects among child characteristics 
and treatment group and joint analyses of multiple data points (repeated measure for number of  symptom 
days and nights, number of ED and PCP visits).  Potential confounding and effect modifying covariates 
include categorical measures such as child gender and insurance status, caregiver  education , and 
continuous variables of caregiver  and child age, caregiver  depression  and child asthma control  level. 
Complications of the repeated measures design include consideration that repeated measures will be 
correlated , thus we will use the Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE)(119) to provide  consistent

estim ators of the regression coefficients and their variances under weak assumptions about the actual 
correlation among a subject’s observations.(119) These models will express number of symptom days as a 
function of time, treatment group, and the AEx treatment by [CONTACT_6491], thus allowing time trends to 
differ for the different groups. While estimating this mean model, the correlation among multiple 
observations on the same individual over time will be taken into account. Model -based and robust variance 
estimates (119-120) will be used as a check on the validity of the longitudinal model .  We expect that outco me 
measures will be influenced by [CONTACT_330024] "month" 
variables associated with each month that the data are collected. In addition, we will model seasonality 
using smoothing spline functions to control for potential non -linear effects of time of the year and asthma 
control . Kaplan -Meier curves for the time to the subsequent ED visit will be calculated for each group. A Cox 
proportional hazard model will be used to estimate relative rates of return ED visits among the two groups, 
controlling for baseline characteristics .  A log -linear regression will be used to model expected number of 
visits  over 12 months as a function of treatment group and baseline covariates.(125)  In the survival and log -
linear  regression analyses, standard regression diagnostics will be used to assure assumptions are 
reasonably satisfied and prevent 1 or a few children from having undue influence on the findings.   
Attrition Management/Study Burden .  In our current PAAL study , we had a 9% attrition rate  at 12 months , 
but anticipate a 1 2% attrition rate  in the AEx study since families are required to attend a follow -up ED visit.  
Detailed contact [CONTACT_3031] , names of two individuals who always know caregiver’s contact [CONTACT_2997],  will be 
obtained at recruitment.  Participants will be advised that a $[ADDRESS_407769] tested the parent questionnaire, 
obtaining saliva and blood draw  during the child’s ED visit and [ADDRESS_407770] s (2/32, 6%) . 
Fidelity of Intervention :   Video recordings of the first 10 and thereafter  10% of AEx visits will be reviewed 
by [CONTACT_6283]. Butz, Bollinger , Okelo  for consistency in the delivery of asthma  education , spi[INVESTIGATOR_329992] . Drs. Bollinger and Mudd will meet with the AEx PNP monthly for assur ance of consistent 
asthma education delivery . For the AEx home visits,  observation of the first ten AEx home visits and 10% of 
visits ther eafter will be conducted /yearly  by [CONTACT_6283]. Butz and Kub  for consistency of home visits  protocol.  Any 
discrepancy between protocol and delivery of intervention will be corrected at time of observation.  
Training of Personnel.  All research staff, P.I. and co -investigators received training in Protection of 
Human Subjects in research studies. Research assistants and interviewing staff will be trained by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Butz 
on the recruitment and consent protocol, interview surveys and confidentiality of data collection . The AEx-
PNP will conduct all AE x clinic visits and certification as an asthma educator is one requirement for 
employment.  The AEx PNP will be trained by [CONTACT_6283]. Bollinger, Butz , and Mudd  for delivery of the intervention 
during the AEx visit.  Drs. Butz and Kub will train /supervise the CON and the AEx home visiting nurse s. 
Timeline:   The study will require five year s (4/01/201 3 – 3/31/201 8) in order  to conduct subject recruitment, 
intervention delivery, follow -up data collection, and data analysis.  See Table 4.

Potential Limitations with Planned  Actions : 
A.  The intervention may not be generalizable to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_329993]-low income popul ations. While this is 
a limitation, if  effective the intervention could be modified for use in rural an d community -based health 
center because the AEx clinic i s staf fed by [CONTACT_330025] /nurse , environmental control  education can 
often be referred to local health departments  and standardized forms(asthma control, asthma action plans 
and tests (Spi[INVESTIGATOR_038], RAST) are widely available .   
B. Inadequate subject recruitment . We have had extensive experience with recruiting high risk children with 
asthma and have an established relationship with [CONTACT_330030], Associate Director of Johns Hopkins 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_329994] -investigator on the project.  If unable to achieve our sample size in 
the projected time frame, we will seek approval to recruit subjects from additional Baltimore hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]  (Johns 
Hopkins Bayview Medical Center, University of Maryland  Medical System) used in prior studies.    
C.  Low retention of study participants.   Our current Pediatric Asthma Alert  study  (NR010546) using a 
comparable population, sustained a 91-95% retention rate  at 6 and 12 months . If our retention rate < 80% 
we will use home visits by [CONTACT_330026], non -intervention staff to track families lost to follow -up.

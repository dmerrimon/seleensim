Refer to the investi gator’s brochure  (IB) for detailed information concerning the available 
pharmacology, toxicology, drug metabolism, clinical studies , and adverse event (AE) profile 
of the investigational  medicinal product ( study drug ). 
1.1. Overview  
Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chro nic disorder characterised by [CONTACT_304160], primarily the colon, as well as the rectum in approximately 95% of cases. The goals 
of treatment of UC are to induce and maintain remission of symptoms. Oral aminosalicylate 
(eg, sulfasalazin e) therapy comprises the conventional standard of care in the 
pharmacological treatment of mild  to moderate active UC. Corticosteroids  or 
immunosuppressants may also be used to treat symptoms. Subject s unable to be treated with 
conventional therapi[INVESTIGATOR_304138] (ie, an anti -tumour necrosis factor [TNF] -α agent).[ADDRESS_372015] immunocompromising effects that increase patient risks to other diseases and 
a range of infections (mycobacterial, fungal, viral).4 Reported treatme nt failures further limit 
the utility of biologic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].5 New therapi[INVESTIGATOR_304139].  
BBT -401 was derived from Smad6 and developed to modulate inflammatory disorders. 
BBT -401 directly interacts with Pellino -1 protein, compet itively binding in a dose -dependent 
manner, thus inhibiting the proinflammatory activity of Pellino -1. Given the inflammatory 
pathophysiology of UC and the effects of BBT -401 on inhibiting inflammatory processes, 
there is a pharmacological rationale to eva luate BBT -401 in the treatment of UC.  
. A Phase 1 clinical study  of orally  administered 
BBT -401-1S  showed no systemic 
exposure and an excellent safety  and tolerabi lity profile , with no serious adverse events 
(SAEs). Mild diarrhoea  (usually transient in nature and generally not interfering with normal 
activities) was the most observed AE in the 1600 -mg single - and multiple -ascending -dose 
cohorts.  Additionally, orally  administered BBT -401-1S was generally well  tolerated at doses 
of 400 mg/day in an exploratory study of efficacy in subject s with UC. Conclusions on 
efficacy have not yet been made . 
This clinical study  of BBT -401-1S is designed to explore the safety and efficacy of 
BBT -401-1S administered orally  in subject s with active UC.  
 
 
1.2. Benefit -risk Assessment  
Subject s participating in this study may experience therapeutic benefit to symptoms of UC.  

Protocol  CONFIDENTIAL  
 Protocol  Reference: BBT401 -UC-[ADDRESS_372016] s will be 
closely monitored for safety and tolerability.  
There is low risk of drug -drug interactions between BBT -401-1S and common 
comedications, based on the low systemic exposure and benign safety profiles demonstrated 
in the nonclinical and clinical studies.  
More information about the known and expected benefits, risks , and reasonably anticipated 
AEs associated with  BBT -401-1S may be found in the I B.

Nonclinical pharmacological assays showed a less than dose -proportional increase in efficacy 
(up to 400 mg/kg/day in mice and 100 mg/kg/day in rats, which correspond to human 
equivalent doses of 2000  and 970 mg /day, respectively).  
 
 
  
Clinical studies of single doses of up to 1600 mg and multiple doses of up to 1600 mg/day for 
7 days in healthy subjects indicated that BBT -401-1S is not absorbed systemically (plasma 
concentrations were below the lower limit of quantification [<1  ng/mL]) . No SAEs were 
reported in this study. Additionally, in an exploratory study of the efficacy in subject s with 
UC, orally  administered BBT -401-1S was generally well  tolerated at 400 mg/day for up to

• change in compliance with any inclusion/exclusion criterion that is clinically relevant  
and affects subject safety  as determined by [CONTACT_093]  (or designee ) 
• noncompliance with the study restrictions that might affect subject safety or study 
assessments/objectives, as considered applicable by [CONTACT_093]  (or designee)  
• any clinicall y relevant sign or symptom  (including disease worsening)  that, in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_871]  (or designee) , warrants subject withdrawal . 
If a subject is withdrawn from dosing , the sponsor will be notified and the date and reason(s) 
for the withdrawal will be documented in the subject ’s electronic case report form . If a 
subject is withdrawn  from the study , efforts will be made to perform  all early termination  
assessments , if possible ( Appendix  11). Other procedures may be performed at  the 
investigator ’s (or designee’s)  and/or sponsor ’s discretion. The investigator  (or designee) may 
also request that the su bject return for an additional follow -up visit. All withdrawn subjects 
will be followed until resolution of all their AEs or until the unresolved AEs are judged by 
[CONTACT_093]  (or designee) to have stabili sed. 
4.7. Study Termination  
The study may be discon tinued at the discretion of the sponsor if any of the following criteria 
are met:  
• AEs unknown to date (ie, not previously reported in any similar investigational study 
drug trial with respect to their nature, severity, and/or duration)  
• increased frequency , severity , and/or duration of known , anticipated, or previously 
reported AEs (this may also apply to AEs defined predose on Day 1  as baseline signs

the study, the date, time, and reason will be  recorded in the subject’s source data.  
5.5. Treatment Compliance  
Where doses are administered at the study site, all doses will be administered under the 
supervision of suitably qualified study site staff and treatment administration will be 
documented at the study site.  
Where doses are administered away from the study site , subjects will document treatment 
administration using subject  diaries that will be reviewed at study site visits.  Additionally, 
unused study drug  will be returned to the study site for assessment of treatment compliance.  
5.6. Rescue Therapy  
A rescue treatment is defined as any procedure or medication (new medications  or 
medication s that have been increased in dose) used for the treatment of new or persi stent 
symptoms of UC.  
If a subject who does not exhibit a clinical response experiences worsening of disease (ie, 
worsening of clinical status or symptoms of UC that require rescue treatment) or disease 
relapse , study drug must be discontinued , and subject s should be treated as clinically 
appropriate  with conventional treatments for active disease , as determined by [CONTACT_1275] . These subjects should continue in the study for safety assessments but will be 
considered treatment failures with respe ct to the intent -to-treat population.  
A subject will be considered to have disease relapse when they meet all of the following 
criteria:  
• an increase in UC disease activity  after achievement of a clinical response , defined as 
an increase from  nadir or Day 57 in partial Mayo score of ≥2  points  and a n absolute 
partial Mayo score ≥4 points , and  
• an endoscopic subscore of ≥2 points, and  
• exclusion of other causes of increased disease activity that are unrelated to UC (eg, 
infections or changes in medication).

clinical remission status , and treatment to be assigned in the extension phase. C entrally read 
Mayo endoscopic subscores will be used to  evaluate the subject’s eligibility and the 
objectives of the study . Further details of the endoscopy procedur es and their standardisation 
will be documented in a separate charter.  
Subject s will be  required to undergo a full colonoscopy at screening; a flexible 
proctosigmoidoscopy will not be an option.   Subsequent endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_304141] a full 
colonoscopy or a flexible proctosigmoidoscopy; this will be at the investigator’s discretion,

7.1.3.  Mayo Score  
The total Mayo score (Appendix  6) is an instrument desi gned to measure disease activity of 
UC, with scores ranging from 0 to 12 points. The total Mayo score consists of 4  subscores, 
each graded from 0 to 3 with higher scores indicating more severe disease. For the 
Protocol  CONFIDENTIAL  
 Protocol  Reference: BBT401 -UC-[ADDRESS_372043]  2021   Page 25 of 60 endoscopic subscore, the modified Mayo endosco pic score will be used to exclude any 
friability from Grade 1.  
• stool frequency (0  to 3) 
• rectal bleeding (0  to 3) 
• findings o n endoscopy (0  to 3) 
• physician ’s global assessment (PGA ; 0 to 3). 
The total Mayo score (including the findings on endoscopy subscore) measured at screening 
will be used as the total Mayo baseline score.  
The partial Mayo score (Appendix  7) consists of 3 subscores  (stool frequency, rectal 
bleeding, and PGA).  
The modified Mayo score ( Appendix  8) consists of 3 subscores (stool frequency, rectal 
bleeding, and findings on endoscopy).  
Where applicable, the subscores of stool frequency and rectal bleeding will be answered by 
[CONTACT_423] , subscores of PGA  will be assessed by [CONTACT_304168] , and findings on endoscopy will be assessed by [CONTACT_304169] . 
7.1.4.  Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire  
The IBDQ is a health -related quality -of-life (HRQoL) tool measuring bowel , systemic, 
emotional, and social function  (Appendix 10). Scores  for each question  range between 1 and 
7, reflecting poor to good HRQoL , for a range of possible total scores from 32 to 224 . 
7.1.5.  Histopathology  
Mucosal biopsy samples will be collected during endoscopy for the histologic assessment of 
disease and healing. Measurements of histologic improvement will b e performed by a central 
reader  guided  by [CONTACT_304170] ( Appendix  9). Further details of the histologic procedures 
and their standardisation will be documented in a separate charter.  
Biopsy samples will be used to explore the efficacy and safety of BBT -401-1S using gene 
expression and profiling; tissue blocks may be used for RNA analysis and/or 
immunohistochemistry. The biomarkers to be investigated will include, but will not be 
limited to: interleukin  (IL)-8, granulocyte -macrophage colony -stimulating factor, I L-6, IL1 -β, 
TNF -α, IL -23, IL -17, and retinoic acid receptor -related orphan receptor C.   
7.2. Biomarkers  
Serum C -reactive protein and f aecal  calprotectin will be measured to support the efficacy 
assessments.   
Protocol  CONFIDENTIAL  
 Protocol  Reference: BBT401 -UC-[ADDRESS_372044] will be monitored from the time of  signing the ICF to final 
discharge from the study . Subjects will be observed for any signs or symptoms and asked 
about their condition by [CONTACT_93424], such as “How have you been feeling since you 
were last asked?” , at each study visit. Subjects will also be encouraged to spontaneously 
report AEs occurring at any other time during the study.  
Any AEs and remedial action required will be recorded in the subject ’s source data. The 
nature, time of onset, duration, and severity will be documented, together with an 
investigator ’s (or designee’s) opi[INVESTIGATOR_304144] . 
Adverse events  recorded during the study that are possibly related or related to the study drug 
or study procedures  will be  followed up , where possible, to resolution or until the unresolved 
AEs are judged by [CONTACT_093]  (or designee) to have stabili sed. This will be completed at 
the investigator ’s (or designee’s ) discretion.  
7.4.2.  Clinical Laboratory Evaluations  
Blood and urine samples will be collected for clinical laboratory evaluations. Clinical 
laboratory evaluations are listed in Appendix  2. For all subjects,  a Clostridium difficile  test 
will be performed at screening.  For all female subjects of childbearing potential , a serum 
pregnancy test will be performed  at scre ening and urine pregnancy tests performed at all 
other timepoints . An investigator  (or designee ) will perform a clinical assessment of all 
clinical laboratory data.  
7.4.3.  Vital Signs  
Supi[INVESTIGATOR_304145], supi[INVESTIGATOR_304146] , and tympanic  temperature will 
be assessed. Vital signs may also be performed at other times if judged to be clinically 
appropriate or if the ongoing review of the data suggests a more detailed assessment of vital 
signs is required.  All measurements will be performed singly and  repeated once if outside the 
relevant clinical reference range.  
Subjects must be supi[INVESTIGATOR_304147] 5  minutes before blood pressure and pulse rate 
measurements.  For individual subjects, the same pos ture and same arm  should be used for all 
measurements throughout the study. Vital signs should be assessed prior to blood sampling.  
Protocol  CONFIDENTIAL  
 Protocol  Reference: BBT401 -UC-[ADDRESS_372045] 5  minutes . Single 12 -lead ECGs will be repeated once if either of the following criteria 
apply:  
• QT interval corrected for heart rate using Fridericia’s method (QTcF) >500 ms 
• QTcF change from the baseline (predose) is >60 ms. 
Additional 12 -lead ECGs may be performed at other times if judged to be clinically 
appropriate or if the ongoing review of the data suggests a more detailed assessment of ECGs 
is required.  The investigator  (or designee)  will perform a n assessment of each 12 -lead ECG  
to determine any clinically significant findings.  
7.4.5.  Physical Examination  
Physical examination s will be performed.  Body weight will be measured as part of physical 
examinations.  
7.5. Guidelines, Study A ssessments, and Procedures During the Coronavirus 
Disease -19 Pandemic  
In view of the coronavirus disease -19 (COVID -19) worldwide pandemic, the safety and 
wellbeing of study subjects is of primary importance.  Study sites must comply with local 
public health rules.  
Although every effort should be made to follow the protocol, subject safety is paramount and 
the investigator should continue to reassess the risks and benefits of continued study 
participation for e ach subject.  
If a subject is diagnosed with COVID -[ADDRESS_372046] COVID -19, they should 
follow the local treatment and quarantine guidances.  
• All diagnoses, procedures, assessments, dosing interruptions, and sequelae should be 
recorded in the el ectronic case report form (eCRF).  
• Adverse events and SAEs should be reported in accordance with instructions in 
Appendix  1. If an AE or SAE related to COVID -[ADDRESS_372047] is unable to attend study site visits and/or receive study drug, site staff should 
keep conta ct with the subject, preferably via telephone calls, to maintain awareness of subject 
status. If the subject is unable to attend the site, the following options may be considered:  
• Subjects may be visited at their home by [CONTACT_304171] 
(where possible due to social distancing requirements).  
• Visits may be performed by [CONTACT_304172].  
Protocol  CONFIDENTIAL  
 Protocol  Reference: BBT401 -UC-[ADDRESS_372048]  2021   Page 28 of 60 • Blood samples may be collected and analysed at an alternative healthc are facility, at 
the discretion of the investigator. Although results of these analyses may not 
necessarily be collected or documented in the study database, it will allow the 
investigator to assess subject safety.  
• If the endoscopy at the end -of-treatment visit can not be performed, the partial Mayo 
score may be collected by [CONTACT_135681] (preferred).  
8. SAMPLE SIZE  AND DATA ANALYSIS  
8.1. Determination of Sample Size  
There has not been any formal statistical assessment of the sample size. However, the n umber 
of subjects is common in early clinical studies and is considered sufficient to achieve the 
objectives of the study.  
8.2. Analysis Populations  
The intent -to-treat population  will include all subjects who received at least [ADDRESS_372049] descriptive statistics: number of 
subject s (n), mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum. Frequ ency of 
subject s or events and percentages will be summari sed in categorical variables.  
8.4. Efficacy Analyses  
8.4.1.  Primary  and Secondary Efficacy Analysis  
All subjects in the intent -to-treat population will be included in the primary and secondary 
efficacy analys es. Descriptive summaries will be presented for clinical response, clinical 
remission, and endoscopic remission rate s. The estimate and 95% confidence interval (CI) of 
clinical response, clinical remission, and endoscopic remission rates at Day [ADDRESS_372050] binomial method  for each treatment . The Fisher’s exact test will be 
used to evaluate any differences between treatments.   
Missing data will be deemed as “unresponsive”. If any event that was not initially anticipated 
demands to reconsider data handling, then the method of handling the relevant data will be 
established in the statistical analysis plan.  
8.4.2.  Exploratory Efficacy Analysis  
All subjects in the intent -to-treat population will be included in the exploratory effica cy 
analysis. The estimate and 95% CI of endoscopic response  rate and histological improvement 
at Day 57 , and clinical response rate and the percentage of subjects with clinical  remission at

 Protocol  Reference: BBT401 -UC-[ADDRESS_372053]  2021   Page 31 of 60 Appendix  1: Adverse Event Reporting  
Definitions  
An adverse event ( AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject  or clinical 
investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product, which does not necessarily have 
a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavourable  and/or 
unintended sign (including a  clinically significant  abnormal  laboratory finding), symptom, or 
disease temporally associated with the use of a study drug, whether or not related to the study 
drug. 
Assessment of Severity  
The investigator  will be asked to provide an assessment of the severity of the AE using the 
following categories:  
• Mild : Usually transient and may require only minimal treatment or therapeutic 
intervention. The event does not generally interfere with usual activities of d aily 
living.  
• Moderate : Usually alleviated with additional specific therapeutic intervention. The 
event interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing discomfort but poses no 
significant or permanent risk of harm to the subject.  
• Severe : Interrupt s usual activities of daily living, or significant ly affects clinical 
status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention.  
Relationship to Study Treatment  
The investigator  (or designee) will decide  the relationship of the AE to the study drug using a  
4-category system according to the following guidelines:  
• Not Related : The AE is definitely caused by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state or the study 
procedure/conditions.  
• Unlikely Related : The temporal association between the AE and the drug is such that 
the dr ug is not likely to have any reasonable association with the AE.  
• Possibly Related : The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of 
drug administration , but could have been produced by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state or 
the study procedures/cond itions.  
• Related : The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
drug, abates upon discontinuation of the drug, follows a known or hypothesi sed 
cause -effect relationship, and (if appropriate) reappears when the drug is reintroduced .  
Follow -up of Adverse Events  
Every reasonable effort will be made to follow  up with subjects who have AEs. Any subject 
who has an ongoing AE that is possibly related or related to the  study drug  or study 
procedures at the follow -up visit will be followed  up, where possible, until resolution  or until 
the unresolved AE is judged by [CONTACT_093]  (or designee) to have stabili sed. This will be 
Protocol  CONFIDENTIAL  
 Protocol  Reference: BBT401 -UC-[ADDRESS_372054]  2021   Page 32 of 60 completed at the investigator ’s (or designee’s) discretion. Any subject who has an ongoing 
AE that is not related or unlikely related to the study drug  or study procedures at the 
follow -up visit can be closed out as ongoing at the investigator ’s discretion.   
Adverse Drug Reactions  
All noxious and unintended responses to a study drug  (ie, where a causal relationship 
between a study drug  and an AE is at least a reasonable possibility) related to any dose 
should be considered adverse drug reactions.  
An unexpected adverse drug reaction is defined as an adverse reaction, the nature or severity 
of which is not consistent with the applicable product information (eg, investigator ’s 
brochure  for an unapproved study drug ). 
Serious Adverse Events  
A serious AE (SAE) is defined as any untoward medic al occurrence that at any dose either:  
• results in death  
• is life -threatening  
• requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_218747]  
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (disability is defined as a 
substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions)  
• results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• results in an important medical event (see below).  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or re quire 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_304148], based upon appropriate medical judg ement, 
they may jeopardi se the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
Instances of death or co ngenital abnormality, if brought to the attention of the investigator  at 
any time after cessation of the study drug  and considered by [CONTACT_304173] , will be reported to the sponsor.  
Definition of Life -threatening  
An AE is life -threatening if the subject was at immediate risk of death from the event as it 
occurred (ie, does not include a reaction that might have caused death if it had occurred in a 
more serious form). For instance, drug -induced hepatitis that resol ved without evidence of 
hepatic failure would not be considered life -threatening even though drug -induced hepatitis 
can be fatal.  
Definition of Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_304149]. In general, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_304150] (usually involving an overnight 
Protocol  CONFIDENTIAL  
 Protocol  Reference: BBT401 -UC-[ADDRESS_372055]  2021   Page 33 of 60 stay) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_22771]/or treatment that would not have 
been appropriate at the  study site . When in doubt as to whether hospi[INVESTIGATOR_304151], the AE should be considered as serious.  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_304152], which are not the result of 
an AE, need not be considered AEs and should be recorded on a clinical assessment form  and 
added to the electronic case report form . If anything untoward is reported during the 
procedure, this must be reported as an AE and either ‘serious’ or ‘nonserious’ attributed 
according to the usual criteria.  
Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
The invest igator  will complete an SAE report form and forward it by [CONTACT_304174] ( DSS) and the sponsor immediately (within 24  hours) upon 
becoming aware of an SAE.  
The responsibilities of Labcorp  DSS include the following:  
• Prepa re an AE reporting plan prior to the start of the study. Where this plan differs 
from the applicable study site  standard operating procedure on SAE reporting, the 
Safety Management Pla n will always take precedence.  
• Receive and review SAE report forms from the study site  and inform the sponsor of 
the SAE within [ADDRESS_372056]. 
• Write case narratives and enter the case into Labcorp ’s safety database  as defined in 
the AE reporting plan . 
• Produce appropriate reports of all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions and 
forward to the ethics committee, principal investigator,  and the sponsor .  
The responsibility for reporting SAEs will be transferred to the sponsor 28  days after the end 
of the study.  
Pregnancy  
Pregnancy (maternal or paternal exposure to study drug ) does not meet the definition of an 
AE. However, to fulfil  regulatory requirements any pregnancy should be reported following 
the SAE process to collect data on the outcome for both mother and foetus . A separate 
consent form will be signed by [CONTACT_304175].

Definitions  
Females  of Childbearing Potential : premenopausal females who are anatomically and 
physiologically capable of becoming pregnant following menarche.  
Females  of Non childbearing  Potential:  
1. Surgically sterile : females who are permanently sterile via hysterectomy, bilateral 
salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656] , and/or bilateral oophorectomy by [CONTACT_237083]/or 
medical records. Surgical sterili sation to have occurred a minimum of 6 weeks, or at 
the investigator’s discretion, prior to screening.  
2. Postmenopausal : females at least 45 years of age with amenorrh oea for 12  months 
without an alternative medical reason with confirmatory follicle -stimulati ng hormone 
levels of ≥40 mIU/mL. The amenorrh oea should not be induced by a medical 
condition , such as anorexia nervosa, hypothyroid disease , or polycystic ovarian 
disease, or by [CONTACT_178697]. It should not be due to concomitant medications that 
may ha ve induced the amenorrh oea, such as oral contraceptives, hormones, 
gonadotropin -releasing hormones, anti -oestrogens, or selective oestrogen receptor 
modulators.  
Fertile male : a male that is considered fertile after puberty.  
Infertile male : permanently sterile male via :

• vasectomy performed at least [ADDRESS_372059] be willing to 
use 2 methods (1  primary and 1 secondary method) of birth control from the time of signing 
the informed consent form  (ICF) until [ADDRESS_372060] dose of study drug . Primary 
(non-barrier) methods of contraception include:  
• hormonal injection ( as prescribed ) 
• combined oral contraceptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_64870]/progestogen -only pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382] ( as prescribed ) 
• combined hormonal vaginal rin g (as prescribed )

occlusion of the fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_2134]  
• hormonal implant  
• hormonal or non -hormonal intrauterine device . 
Secondary (barrier) methods of contraception include:  
• male condom  
• female condom  
• diaphragm ( as prescribed ). 
Female subjects of childbearing potential who have an infertile male partner are not required 
to use contraception, providing that the infertile male is the sole partner of the female subject.  
A barrier method of contraception may be encouraged but is not required.  
Female subjects of childbearing potential sh ould refrain from donation of ova from Day [ADDRESS_372062] use a barrier method of 
contraception in addition to a second method of acceptable contraception from Day 1  until 
3 months  after the follow -up visit.  
Barrier methods of contraception include:  
• male condom  
• female condom  
• diaphragm (as prescribed).  
Acceptable secondary methods of contraception for female partners include:  
• hormonal injection  
• combined oral contraceptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_304153]/progestogen -only pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]  
• combined hormonal vaginal ring  
• surgical method  (bilateral tubal ligation or Essure® [hysteroscopic bilateral tubal 
occlusion])

Protocol  CONFIDENTIAL  
 Protocol  Reference: BBT401 -UC-[ADDRESS_372063]’s lifestyle choice (ie, the subject 
should not become abstinent just for the purpose of study particip ation), are exempt from 
contraceptive requirements. Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, 
postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. If a 
subject who is abstinent at the time of signing the ICF  becomes sexually active , they must 
agree to use contraception as described previously.  
For subjects who are exclusively in same -sex relationships, contraceptive requirements do not 
apply. If a subject who is in a same -sex relationship at the time of sign ing the ICF becomes 
engaged in a heterosexual relationship, they must agree to use contraception as described 
previously.

 Protocol  Reference: BBT401 -UC-[ADDRESS_372090]  2021   Page 59 of 60 Appendix  12: Summary of Changes  
The following changes were implemented in Protocol Version 2:  
• It was clarified that the Mayo endoscopic subscore will be assessed by [CONTACT_17588] a local 
and qualified central  reader. Locally read Mayo endoscopic subscores will be used to 
determine the subject’s  eligibility, clinical remission status , and treatment to be 
assigned in the extension phase. Centrally read Mayo endoscopic subscores will be 
used to evaluate the objec tives of the study.  
• Measurements of the tissue concentration of BBT -401-1S at screening were removed.  
• The time window for the Day 57 endoscopy was updated.  
• The time windows for visits in the extension phase were updated.  
• The fasting requirements were remov ed. 
• It was clarified that stool frequency and rectal bleeding will be documented daily by 
[CONTACT_423].  
• The unit of glomerular filtration rate was corrected.  
The following changes were implemented in Protocol Version 3:  
• Protocol Version [ADDRESS_372091]’s eligibility. This was corrected to state that 
centrally read Mayo endoscopic subscores will be used to evaluate the objectives of 
the study.  
The followi ng changes were implemented in Protocol Version 4:  
• Clarified that subjects who test positive for Clostridium difficile  at screening will be 
excluded.  
• Added that clinical laboratory evaluations, including liver function tests, may be

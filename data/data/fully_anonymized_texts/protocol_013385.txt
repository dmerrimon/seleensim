CV-20-63 Clinical Investigation Plan (CIP) Validatio n Template v 1.0: 06- May-2021  1 Study Objectiv e 
This is a  confirmatory  Design Validation study to provide supportive evidence to demonstrate that the 
Apollo  lens meets  the clinical performance requirements specified in the User Requirements Design 
Inputs per D28298, DHF0122. 
Specifically, the User R equirements to be evaluated in this clinical study are : 
•Vision of Apollo  is equivalent  to Gemini
•Comfort of Apollo is equivalent  (or better)  to Gemini
•Lens fit of Apollo is equivalent to Gemini
•Lens handling of Apollo is equivalent to Gemini
•Ocular health of Apollo is equivalent to Gemini
Details of the statistical hypothesis that are required to be met in fulfilment of Validation can be found in 
Section 9.1 below .  
2 Study Design 
This will be a prospective, two -day, double- masked (investigator and subject), randomized, bilateral  
crossover study comparing the Test lens against an appropriate comparator (Control) lens. Each subject 
will wear either the Apollo lens or the Gemini/Aquiane comparator lens (Control) in a bilateral fashion for two days followed by [CONTACT_866355] . The Gemini  lens is a currently marketed product 
that is representative of the state -of-the art of contact [CONTACT_13276].  
There will be a total of three  visits in the study as described in 7.[ADDRESS_1208791] lens
material  and design currently approved / cleared in the EU only [riofilcon A /Acquiane]. The Control lens
is also an investigational lens, currently approved / cleared in the EU  only.

8 Adverse Event s and Device Deficiencies  
8.1 Adverse Event Definitions 
An ‘adverse event’ refers to any undesirable clinical occurrence in a participant, whether it is considered 
to be device -related or not. Adverse events (AE) may be classified as ‘unanticipated adverse device 
effects,’ ‘serious adverse events,’ ‘significant  adverse events,’ or ‘non- significant adverse events,’ as 
defined below.

treatment or which necessitates discontinuation of lens wear for ≥ 2 weeks  Classification  Definition  
Serious Adverse 
Event  Those events that are life -threatening, or result in permanent impairment of a body 
function, or permanent damage to a body structure  or necessitate medical 
(therapeutic) or surgical intervention to preclude permanent impairment of a body 
function or permanent damage to a body structure.  
Significant 
Adverse Event  Those non- serious adverse events that occur with contact [CONTACT_528718] -threatening but are usually symptomatic and may warrant therapeutic 
management and /or temporary or permanent discontinuation of contact [CONTACT_13279].  
Non- Significant 
Adverse Events  Those less severe non -serious adverse events that occur w ith contact [CONTACT_813250] -threatening, may or may not be symptomatic and may warrant 
palliative management, such as ocular lubricants or  temporary interruption of contact 
[CONTACT_13279].  
Unanticipated 
Adverse Device 
Effect  Adverse events in a  clinical trial that were not previously identified in the protocol in 
terms of nature, severity, or degree of incidence. An Unanticipated Serious Adverse 
Device Effect is an unanticipated adverse event that is serious in nature and caused 
by [CONTACT_866367].

The secondary statistical hypothesis is that the vision performance with the Test lens will demonstrate 
statistical equivalence to the comparator (Control) lens over two days of lens wear .  
Other hypotheses : 
The lens fit performance with the Test lens will demonstrate statistical equivalence to the comparator

The lens handling performance with the Test lens will demonstrate statistical equivalence to the 
comparator (Control) lens  over two days of lens wear.

Therefore, a sample size of approximately 45 completing subjects is sufficient for this study.  
9.3 Statistical Analysis  
Summary statistics [may/will] be produced (e.g. mean, standard deviation). Paired t -test will be used to 
compare slit lamp biomicroscopy, lens fit and subjective scores between study lens types. Where 
applicable, Repeated Measures Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) or paired analysis will be used to compare the variables between study visits. The critical alpha level for statistical significance will be set 
at p ≤  0.05, with adjustment for multiple comparisons.  
Equival ence testing will be undertaken to first determine statistical non-inferiority and then equivalence 
(if applicable) to the comparator (Control) lens, to confirm  the primary and secondary hypothes es.  
9.4 Data Entry / Data Management 
Data collection is the responsibility of the clinical trial staff at the site under the supervision of the clinical 
site Principal Investigator. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_19760], completeness, legibility, and timeliness of the data reported. All source documents should be completed 
in a neat, legible manner to ensure accurate interpretation of data.

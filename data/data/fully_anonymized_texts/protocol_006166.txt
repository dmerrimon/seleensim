Protocol Version 1.0  Version date: 20/Sept/2021 Page 20 of 72 The Investigator may at his/her discretion arrange for a study participant to have an unscheduled visit (UNS). Some of the circumstances by [CONTACT_9444] a study participant will be called for a UNS visit are:    • Adverse events (AEs) that require follow-up.  • Collection of laboratory samples for safety reasons.  • Procedures missed at previous study visits.    All unscheduled visits should be documented in the study’s participant source.   Trial Assessments   Assessments Related to Endpoints    Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)  The Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) is a method of quantifying disability in multiple sclerosis and monitoring changes in the level of disability over time. It is widely used in clinical trials and in the assessment of patients with MS.  The scale was developed by a neurologist called John Kurtzke in 1983 as an advance from his previous 10 step Disability Status Scale (DSS).  The EDSS scale ranges from [ADDRESS_1157066].  EDSS steps 1.0 to 4.5 refer to people with MS who can walk without any aid and is based on measures of impairment in eight functional systems (FS):  • pyramidal – muscle weakness or difficulty moving limbs • cerebellar – ataxia, loss of balance, coordination, or tremor • brainstem – problems with speech, swallowing and nystagmus • sensory – numbness or loss of sensations • bowel and bladder function • visual function - problems with sight • cerebral functions - problems with thinking and memory • other

Protocol Version 1.0  Version date: 20/Sept/2021 Page 21 of 72 A functional system (FS) represents a network of neurons in the brain with responsibility for tasks. Each FS is scored on a scale of 0 (no disability) to 5 or 6 (more severe disability).   EDSS steps 5.[ADDRESS_1157067] people will never reach these scores. A large study that looked at people with MS at a clinic in Ontario (prior to the development of the expanded version) found that 51% of people had a DSS score of 5 or lower. 88% had a score of 7 or lower (Multiple Sclerosis Trust, 2020).  Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life (MSQOL)-54 Instrument.   The MSQOL-54 is a comprehensive health-related quality of life measure incorporating general and MS-specific questions into a single instrument. The developers used the SF-36 as a base and added 18 questions to address MS-specific problems, including fatigue and cognitive function. This 54-item questionnaire provides 12 subscales, two summary scores, and two extra single-item measures. The subscales are physical function, role limits-physical, emotional role restrictions, pain, emotional well-being, energy, health perceptions, social position, cognitive function, health distress, overall quality of life, and sexual function (National Multiple Sclerosis Society, 2021).   The Barthel Index   When it comes to patients with chronic, debilitating illnesses, the Barthel index is an ordinal scale that evaluates functional independence in the domains of personal care and mobility. A total of ten variables describing activities of daily living and mobility are considered, with a higher number reflecting better capacity to operate independently. The Barthel Index assesses the level of help needed by a person on a set of ten activities of daily living (ADL) related to mobility and self-care (Elite Learning, 2008).  9-Hole Peg test   The 9-HPT is a short, standardized upper extremity exam. In MS research, gait analysis has been given precedence over arm and hand function analysis. In recent years, clinical investigations have increasingly recognized the value of assessing arm and hand function, particularly in severely disabled patients. The 9-HPT has recently become one of the most widely utilized upper extremity measurements in MS. Many qualified examiners can administer the 9-HPT since it is short and standardized. (National Multiple Sclerosis Society, 2021).

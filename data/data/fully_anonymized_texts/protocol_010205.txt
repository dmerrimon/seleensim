Title  A Phase  2b/3 Prospective, Randomized,  Double -Blind,  Sham - Controlled  Trial  of VTS -270 
(2-hydroxypropyl -β-cyclodextrin)  in Subjects  with Neurologic  Manifestations  of Niemann -

1425 US Route 206  
Bedminster,  NJ [ZIP_CODE] 
Number  of Sites  Approximately 24 sites worldwide  
Study  Design  This is a multicenter,  multinational,  prospective,  randomized,  double -blind,  sham -controlled, 
3-part, efficacy  and safety  trial of VTS -270 administered  by [CONTACT_524294]  (IT) route
every 2 weeks, with a planned enrollment of approximately 51 subjects (in Parts A and B)
with Niemann -Pi[INVESTIGATOR_285382] C1 (NPC1)  disease.  The study will be conducted in 3 parts:  Parts  A,
B, and C.
Part A evaluated [ADDRESS_680040] completed Part A.  
Part B will evaluate the safety and efficacy of the dose selected from Part A, 900 mg, 
comp ared with sham control in approximately 51 subjects, including the 12 subjects from 
Part A. Subjects  will receive treatment  with VTS -270 for up to 52 weeks  (inclusive  of Part 
A). Subjects who elect not to continue with Part C will have 26 weeks of follow -up. 
Part C will be an open -label extension phase of the study. Subjects who complete Part B, 
meet  the criteria  for dose reduction  for a second  time,  or meet  the rescue therapy  criteria  after 
6 months of participation in Part B are eligible to participate in Part C. Subjects who are currently active in the National Institutes of Health (NIH) phase 1 study (Protocol 13 -CH- 
0001) will  also be eligible to participate upon  completion  of their participation  in the phase [ADDRESS_680041] received prior written authorization from Vtesse to enroll  directly  into Part C are eligible  to participate.  Part A and B subjects  who transition  into 
Part C will receive treatment with VTS- 270 until the investigator considers VTS -270 to no 
longer  be beneficial,  VTS -270 receives  marketing  authorization,  or the  development  program 
is discontinued. NIH phase 1/2a subjects who transition into Part C will receive treatment with VTS- [ADDRESS_680042], VTS- 270 receives marketing authorization, or the development program is 
discontinued.  
A European site -specific substudy will be conducted as part of the Part C study. This 
substudy will assess the safety and tolerability of the B. Braun Celsite
® Spi[INVESTIGATOR_524285] (hereafter generally referred to as the “device”) for the administration of VTS -270 
every 2 weeks. The device is CE marked in Europe and consists of a subdermal access port connected to a catheter that is positioned in the lumbar IT space. Given that VTS -270 does 
not penetrate the blood- brain barrier and requires IT administration, the ability to administer 
VTS -270 via the device will obviate  the need  for biweekly  lumbar  punctures  (LPs), as well as 
anesthesia, thereby [CONTACT_2869] a significant burden for subjects and site personnel. In this device safety and tolerability substudy, approximately [ADDRESS_680043] 3 lumbar IT doses (900 mg VTS -270) in Part C will und ergo baseline 
assessments approximately 3 days prior to implantation of the device (same day as their last 
administration of VTS- 270 via LP). The device will be implanted in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], and the 
subject will remain in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34092] [ADDRESS_680044] implantation. During the 3 -day 
confinement period (Day 1 surgery, Days 2 and 3), subjects will be given intravenous (IV) antibiotics, which are part of the routine implantation procedure.  
Subjects  entering  the European  site-specific  device safety  and tolerability  substudy will 
continue on their Part C schedule of  assessments but will have additional device safety

evaluations. After a minimum of  [ADDRESS_680045]’s Part C schedule. Where there is duplication of assessments with the Part C schedule, only 1 assessme nt will be 
conducted. Following 9 device infusions of VTS -270 and the specific device safety 
assessments conducted during the treatment period, subjects will either enter the device pharmacokinetic (PK)  substudy described  below  or will remain  in the main  Part C study and 
continue to receive VTS -[ADDRESS_680046]  CSF samples  collected  for measurement  of trough 
2-hydroxypropyl -β-cyclodextrin (HP -β-CD) concentration prior to each subsequent device
infusion of VTS -270.
Dose  Reduction  The following  are guidelines  for which  dose reduction  on an individual  subject  basis  is 
allowed in Part B: 
Subjects  who,  in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871],  experience a  drug- related  adverse event  (AE) 
after any blinded IT treatment that is considered clinically relevant and impactful to the 
subject’s function may have their dose reduced to [ADDRESS_680047]’s dose may be further reduced to [ADDRESS_680048] has had his/her dose reduced and is in Part C on a tolerable dose, the subject
may be dose titrated  back  up (e.g., from  400 mg to 600 mg and from  600 mg to 900 mg)  to a
tolerable dose as determined by [CONTACT_093].
Rescue Option  Subjects  who are enrolled  in Part B and manifest  significant disease  progression according  to 
predefined clinical criteria after [ADDRESS_680049] the option to enter

Test and Control 
Product, Dose, 
and Route of Administration  VTS -270 will be provided in appropriately labeled vials, formulated as a 200 mg/mL 
injectable solution. An unblinded pharmacist/designee at each investigational site will be responsible  for dispensing or preparing  the assigned  dosage  of 900 mg for administration  in 
4.5 mL. In the case of dose reduction,  the 600 mg dose is administered  in 3 mL  and the 400 
mg dose is administered in 2 mL.  
VTS -270 Administration  via Lumbar  Puncture  and Sham  Lumbar  Puncture  
In Part A, VTS -270 administration via LP and sham will be performed every 2 weeks for 4 
administrations.  In Part B, VTS -270 administration  via LP and sham  will be performed  every 
2 weeks for 52 weeks. In Part C, VTS -270 will be administered via LP or the device every 2 
weeks. Instructions for administration via the device are presented in the following subsection.  
The LP and/or  sham  is to be performed  under monitored anesthesia  care (conscious  sedation) 
with an appropriate  oral or IV agent  and performed  by [CONTACT_524299].  General 
anesthesia will be allowed on a case- by-case basis, following discussion with the medical 
monitor, in those subjects for whom a medical condition necessitates it.  
Parents/caregivers  will not be present  in the room  during lumbar  IT or sham  treatment. Thus, 
the subject and the parent will be blinded to treatment, the  former a consequence of 
anesthesia.  
The sham procedure will consist of 1 to 2 small needle pricks on the lower back at the 
location where the LP and IT injection is normally made. The needle(s) will break the skin but no lumbar puncture or needle insertion will occur. The needle prick(s) will be covered with the same bandage that is used to cover the IT injection normally, thus simulating the appearance of an IT LP injection. To maintain the blind, a similar type of anesthesia, 
sedation, or minimal  sedation (e.g., a low  dose of an anxiolytic) should be used for the sham 
procedure as for the subject receiving study drug, following institutional procedures. The 
subject  will be kept in the procedure  room  for approximately 30 minutes,  simulating  the same 
amount of time that subjects administered study drug are kept for administration procedure.  
VTS -270 will be administered as an IT slow  bolus (1 to 2 minutes, depending on the volume 
administered) LP injection (maximum rate of administration = 4.5 mL/minute). The volume of the injection  is determined by [CONTACT_396216]. Prior to the VTS -270 injection, a volume of 
CSF fluid  approximately equal  to the VTS -270 dose is to be removed. Anesthesia  or sedation 
will be used for the IT dosing procedure, following institutional guidelines and procedures.  
All subjects, sham and study drug, are required to lie flat with feet elevated for 30 to 45 minutes  following  dosing. For  the 3 days following  each procedure, subjects  in both the sham 
and active treatment groups are to avoid acoustic overstimulation and minimize exposure to 
loud noises, e.g., headphones for music or video games.

Pi[INVESTIGATOR_174707] C1 (NPC1) Disease  
VTS -[ADDRESS_680070] 3 mL  will be 
collected for clinical laboratory tests (approximately 2 mL) and VTS -270 concentration 
(approximately  1-2 mL).  The volume  of CSF to be removed should be approximately equal  to 
that being administered. VTS -270 will be administered as a slow bolus over 1 to 2 minutes 
with a maximum rate of infusion of 4.5 mL/minute. Non- coring needles adapted for use with 
the device  should be  used.  Normal  hypodermic  needles will damage the port septum and may 
cause leakage of the system or blockage due to small silicone particles from the septum.  
Subjects  are to receive the same  dose of VTS -270 administered  during Study VTS301 Part C 
by [CONTACT_524300].  
Following  the infusion of VTS -270, the system  should be flushed  with 1.5 mL of 
preservative- free 0.9%  saline  solution.  For [ADDRESS_680071]  participation  in Parts  A and/or  B will be approximately 58 weeks,  to 
include a screening period of up to 45 days (maximum), and [ADDRESS_680072] who elects not to participate in Part C, 
for a total of 84 weeks.  
Below  is a summary  of the duration  of Part A and B: 
•Up to 45 days screening
•Up to 8 weeks  in Part A 
•Up to 52 weeks  of dosing,  inclusive  of the 8 weeks  for subjects  from  Part A, for
subjects enrolled in Part B.
•Up to [ADDRESS_680073],  VTS -270 receives 
marketing authorization, or the development program is discontinued.  
Efficacy  Evaluations

Secondary 
Endpoints  Part  B: 
The secondary outcomes  for Part B are divided into 2 categories: Key  secondary  outcome  and 
other secondary outcomes.  
The key secondary  e ndpoints  are 
•Change from baseline at Week 52 in the total NPC –SS score with the hearing
domain and ABR modifiers  removed in the group  treated  with VTS -270 vs. the

Statistics  
Primary  Analysis 
Plan Analysis  populations:  
The intent -to-treat (ITT) population will include all randomized subjects categorized by  [CONTACT_524301]. The modified intent -to-treat (mITT) population will 
consist of all randomized subjects who received at least one dose of VTS -270 infusion or 
sham control. The primary population for the primary efficacy assessment will be the mITT. 
The per -protocol (PP) population will consist of all randomized subjects who had no major 
protocol deviation that would have had an impact on the primary outcome and who received 
at least 75% of their scheduled VTS -[ADDRESS_680074]  of subjects  enrolled  in 
the device PK substudy and whose plasma and/or CSF drug concentrations will provide at 
least [ADDRESS_680075]. Subjects in  the PK population will be used for all PK 
data summaries. 
Primary  outcome  measure:  
The co -primary efficacy endpoints are the change from baseline in NPC -SS composite score 
(sum  of the ambulation,  cognition,  fine motor, and swallowing  components  of the NPC -SS) at 
Week [ADDRESS_680076] their missing Week 52 assessment imputed.  
The Clinician  CGIC is a 7-point Likert scale. The scale requires  assessment  of change from  a 
baseline level of disease activity, with anchors ranging from markedly improved, moderate ly 
improved, and minimally improved to no change and corresponding worsening (minimally, 
moderately, markedly). The analysis of the blinded Clinician CGIC at Week [ADDRESS_680077] using 
study part as a blocking variable. Average  ranks  will be assigned when there  are ties within  a 
block.  Missing Week 52 assessments will be imputed.  
Analysis  of secondary  endpoints:  
The following key secondary endpoints comparing subjects treated w ith VTS- 270 with the 
sham  controls  will be analyzed  using a hierarchical  testing,  serial  gatekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_524293].  
•The change  from  baseline  to Week  52 in total NPC -SS with the hearing domain
and ABR modifiers removed.
•Proportion of Caregiver  CGIC responders  (defined  as a score  of no change,
minimally  improved,  moderately  improved  or markedly  improved)  at Week  52.

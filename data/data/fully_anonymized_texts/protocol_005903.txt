RE: Protocol Administrative Changes and Clarifications for Study B3741002 – A PHASE 3, 
RANDOMIZED, DOUBLE-BLIND, PLACEBO-CONTROLLED STUDY COMPARING THE 
ANALGESIC EFFICACY AND SAFETY OF A SINGLE ORAL DOSE OF A NOVEL FIXED-DOSE 
COMBINATION OF IBUPROFEN [ADDRESS_1194899]-SURGICAL DENTAL PAIN IN OTHERWISE 
HEALTHY SUBJECTS 
 
Dear Investigator, 
 
This Protocol Administrative Change Letter (PACL) is to notify you of the following administrative changes and clarifications to the B3741002 protocol; version 13 Jul 2016:  The edits described below are 
to clarify inconsistencies in the text of the protocol and provide administrative changes that do not impact 
the safety of subjects, the scope of the trial, or the scientific quality of the study, and therefore do not 
qualify as an amendment. 
This PACL makes the following changes:  
/g120 Page 8, under the Sched ule of Activities , under section “e” –  revise “staring” to “starting”  
/g120 Section 1.2 , paragraph 3 – the statement beginning with “The results demonstrated the 
combination was 2.4 to 4.8 times more effective…” should actually state  “The results 
demonstrated the combination was 2.4 to 2.8 times more effective…”  
/g120 Section 4.2 , exclusion criteria #9 states: “U se of any type of systemic corticosteroid within the 
past 30 days or a history of current or previous use of anabolic steroids.” To clarify, systemic 
corticosteroids refer to oral corticosteroids and are disallowed. However, topi[INVESTIGATOR_857657]. 
 
In the event that this protocol requires substantial changes in the future, the administrative changes 
described in this letter will be incorporated into the amended protocol. 
 
Please inform your institutional review board/independent ethics committee of these changes, as required.  
If you have any questions please feel free to contact [CONTACT_857667],

Page 91. INTRODUCTION
1.1. Mechanism of Action/ Indication
Ibuprofen, a “traditional” non-steroidal anti -inflammatory  drug ( NSAID ), decreases the 
synthesis of pain -and inflammation -
promoting prostaglandins via non- selective inhibition of 
cyclo-oxygenase -1 (COX -1) and cy clo-oxygenase -2 (COX -2).[ADDRESS_1194913] at the A1 
and A2 receptors, when plasma concentrations are between 10-100 µM, which has directl y 
been implicated in action of caffeine in humans including the blockage of hy peralgesic 
effects of adenosine.2
1.2.Background and Rationale
Ibuprofen (IBU) is one of the most widely  used nonprescription analgesic/antipy retic agents 
available. Serum concentrations of IBU have demonstrated a linear relationship to the level 
of analgesia .4The [ADDRESS_1194914] efficacious over-the-
counter (OTC) dose of IBU in terms of efficacy  and safet y when compared to other available 
OTC NSAIDs .7,[ADDRESS_1194915] categories: low (<100 mg per day ), moderate 
(100-400 mg per day ), and high intake (>400 mg per day ), with a majority  of individuals 
falling into the moderate consumption category .5,6Caffeine is also available as an oral 
pharmacologic agent at doses of [ADDRESS_1194916] demonstrated that the combination of NSAIDs with caffeine is more 
effective than the NSAID alone in postpartum, headache, and postsurgical (dental) pain 
states.3Forbes et al, intended to quantify the relative incremental efficacy  of the addition of 
caffeine [ADDRESS_1194917] -epi[INVESTIGATOR_857658], tension headache, migraine headache, and 
dysmenorrhea pain.10,11,12,13
[COMPANY_007] Consumer 
Healthcare (PCH) has developed a novel fixed -dose liquid -filled gelatin
capsule (subsequently  referr ed to as liquid capsule) formulation consisting of [ADDRESS_1194918] that the combination of I BU 
400 mg 
and caffeine 100 mg provide s 30- 50% greater reduction in pain over [ADDRESS_1194919] safety and efficacy information that is available in the 
literatu re. Additional information for this compound may  be found in the single reference 
safet y document (SRSD), which for this study is the Investigator’s Brochure ( IB)for the 
combination of I BUwith caffeine . The SRSD for the comparator is the I B for Ibuprof en as a 
single agent .
1.2.1. Design Rationale
The dental pain model was chosen for this trial because the surgical procedure is elective, 
relativel yconsistent, and has a
proven record of assay sensitivity , ie, separating active drugs 
from one another as well as from placebo.  This acute pain model is accepted by [CONTACT_857668] -type analgesics.  The results from dental pain studies have 
been widel y extrapolat ed to other general pain conditions including the most common non-
prescription pain indications. The design of this study  was presented and agreed toby[CONTACT_857669], Health Canada and ANVI SA(Agência Nacional de Vigilância 
Sanitária ; Brazilia n Health Surveillance Agency ), with the intent of obtaining market 
approval for the same indication and dosing schedule as the currentl y marketed IBU liquid 
capsule formulation.
The patient -report edoutcomes (PROs) and design elements of this study  have be en described 
in further detail and are recommended in the Food & Drug Administration ( FDA ) Draft 
Guidance for Industry  Analgesic Indications: Developi[INVESTIGATOR_366287].[ADDRESS_1194920] molar extraction.
The second ary objective of the study is to assess the safet y and tolerability  of IBU400mg
with caffeine 100 mg, IBU 400 mg, and placebo.
2.2.Endpoints
2.2.1. Primary Endpoint
Time -weighted sum of pain relief rating (PRR) and pain intensity  difference (PID) 
from 0 to 8 hours (SPRID0 -8) for IBU [ADDRESS_1194921] eligibility  should be reviewed and documented by  [CONTACT_4653]’s study team before subjects are included in the study .
4.1. Inclusion Criteria
Subjects must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for enro llment into the 
study :
1.Males and females 16 years to 40 y earsofage (inclusive).
2. Female subjects of nonchildbearing potential must meet at least 1 of the following 
criteria:

cause; and have a serum follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH) level confirming the 
postmenopausal state;
Have undergone a documented hy sterectomy  and/or bilateral oophorectom y; 
Have medically  confirmed ovarian failure. 
All other female subjects (including female subjects with tubal ligations) are considered 
to be of childbearing potential.

4.Evidence of a personally  signed and dated informed consent document indicating that the 
subject [or a legally  acceptable representative/parent(s)/legal guardian] has been 
informed of all pertinent aspects o f the stud y
.Subjects requiring a parent or legal 
guardian to sign the informed consent form will also be required to sign an assent
document .
5. Subjects who have undergone outpatient surgical extraction of [ADDRESS_1194922] met baseline pain criteria as described in this protocol. (Note: 
dosing of study  medication must occur within approximately  5 hours (ie, less than or 
equal to 5 hours, 15 minutes) after surgery is complete).

4.4.Lifestyle Requirements
4.4.1. Contraception
All fertile male subject s and female subjects who are of childbearing potential as applicable 
to the study who are, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], sexuall y active and at risk for 
pregnancy  with their partner(s) must agree to use a highly  effective method of contraception 
consistently  and correctly  for the duration of the active treatment period and for [ADDRESS_1194930] of contraception 
methods (see below) and will confirm that the subject has been instructed in its consistent 
and correct use.  At time points indicated in the Schedule of A ctivities, t he investigator or 
designee will inform the subject of the need to use highly  effective contraception consistently  
and correctl y and document the conversation and the subject’s affirmation in the subject’s 
chart (subject s
needs to affirm their consistent and correct use of at least 1 of the selected 
methods of contraception) .  In addition, the investigator or designee will instruct the subject 
to call immediately  if the selected contraception method is discontinued 
or if pregnancy  is 
known or suspected in the subject or the partner .  
Highly  effective methods of contraception are those that, alone or in combination, result in a 
failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently  and correctly  (ie,perfect us e) and 
include the following:
1.Established use of hormonal methods of contraception associated with inhibition of 
ovulation (eg, oral, inserted, injected, implanted, transdermal) provided the subject or 
male subject’s female partner plans to remain on the s ame treatment throughout the 
entire study  and has been using that hormonal contraceptive for an adequate period of 
time to ensure effectiveness .
2.Correctl y placed copper -containing intrauterine device (IUD) .
3.Male condom or female condom used WI TH a separa te spermicide product (ie,foam, 
gel, film, cream, or suppository ).For countries where spermicide is not available or 
condom plus spermicide is not accepted as highly  effective contraception, this option 
is not appropriate.

5.Bilateral tubal ligation/bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_8820] y or bilateral tubal occlusive procedure 
(provided that occlusion has been confirmed in accord ance with the device’s label).
NOTE: Sexual abstinence, defined as compl etely and persistently  refraining from all 
heterosexual intercourse (including during the entire period of risk associated with the 
investigational products ) may  obviate the need for contraception ONLY if this is the 
preferred and usual lifesty le of the su bject.
4.4.2. Dietary Restrictions
Subjects will report to the study  center on the morning of their surgery  in a fasted state (ie, 
they should not ingest food or drink after midnight of the preceding evening).  At the 
surgeon's discretion, clear liquids or gelatin may  be provided to the subject prior to surgery .  
Subjects may  not ingest any  caffeine containing beverages, chocolate, or alcohol within 
48hours prior to taking study  medication or during the entire 8 hour evaluation period.
No food will be allowed following surgery  through 2 hours after the ingestion of study  
medication.  L ow fat ( ≤20% of calorie intake from total fat)10xanthine free beverages, soups, 
or soft foods suitable for consumption by  a post -surgical dental patient will be 
available to 
the subject at all other times provided that no food is consumed within 30 minutes before a 
pain assessment time point.  The times of food consumption will be recorded in the source 
document.
4.5.Sponsor ’sQualified Medical Personnel
The contact i nformation for the sponsor's appropriately  qualified medical personnel for the 
study  is documented in the study  contact [CONTACT_212989] t located in thesupporting study  documentation .
To fac ilitate access to appropriately- qualified medical personnel on study -related m edical 
questions or problems, subjects are provided with a contact [CONTACT_1137]. The contact [CONTACT_4662], 
at a minimum, protocol and investigational product identifiers, subject study numbers,

question or problem originating from another healthcare professional not involved in the 
subject’s participation in the study .The contact [CONTACT_857674]; however, it should be used
only in the event that the established communication pathway s between the investigator site 
and the study team are not available. It is therefore intended to augment, but not replace, the 
established communication pathway s between the investigator site and the study  team for 
advice on medical questions or problems that may arise during the stud y.The contact

and entered in the case report form (CRF).
In the event of a medical emergency that necessitates breaking the code, the third party
person(nel) will be permitted to inform the I nvestigator what investigational product the 
subject was given.  This disclosure will only  be broken by  [CONTACT_857678]’s double blind investigational product will 
have a direct impact on treatme nt decisions.  Every  effort will be made to discuss the 
decision to break the blind with the Sponsor’s Clinician in advance.
When the blind is broken, the I nvestigator will notify  the Sponsor’s Clinician within 24 hours 
after determining that it is necessa ry to unblind the treatment assignment and document the 
reason and date of the unblinding.  The event will be recorded in the CRF and in the source 
document. Any AE or serious adverse events ( SAE )associated with breaking the blind must 
be recorded and re ported as specified in this protocol.
5.3.Subject Compliance
All doses of investigational product will be administered by  [CONTACT_110443].
Page [ADDRESS_1194932] Supplies
5.4.1. Dosage Form(s) and Packaging
The Spons or will provide the investigational products described above i n bulk and will send 
prepared labels for the corresponding medication to the site.  
Rescue medications, tramadol and codeine, will be supplied by  [CONTACT_779].
5.4.2. Preparation and Dispensing
The Sponsor, PCH Clinical Supplies will provide instructions onhow to prepare the 
investigational product for administration.  I nvestigational product (ie, study  medication and 
placebo) and rescue medication should be prepared and dispensed b y an appropriatel y 
qualified and experienced member of the stud y staff (eg, ph ysician, nurse, phy sician’s 
assistant, practitioner, or pharmacist) as allowed by [CONTACT_857679], and institutional 
guidance. 
On the day  of surgery , each subject entered into the study  will be given one dose (1 liquid 
filled capsule) of the randomly
 assigned investigational product with approximately  
6-8ounces of room temperature water when they  are experiencing post -surgical pain of at 
least moderate severit y.  From the time that study  medicati on is taken, the duration of 
evaluation will be [ADDRESS_1194933] part y person(nel) onl y.  Opaque plastic bottles and caps will be supplied 
separately  from the labels to the third party person(nel) as well.
The third part y dispenser will prepare stud y medication for each subject in a designated 
dispensing room.  Ba seline pain assessments and drug administration will be completed in 
the subject’s room.  Investigational product will be dispensed at the time the subject’s pain 
level is determined b y verbal assessment b y the appropriatel y qualified site staff member, 
just prior to the completion of the baseline NPSRfor pain severity and VAS PSR.  The study  
coordinator will communicate the subject’s pain severity  to the dispenser.  If qualified for 
randomization, the dispenser will assign the next available randomization number.  The 
dispenser will dispense the randomized investigational product (2 liquid- filled gelatin 
capsules per dose) from the appropriate bulk supply  containers into an individual opaque 
plastic bottle.  The double- blind label with the same randomizati on number will be affixed to 
the bottle and the identification tab will be affixed to the investigational product dispensing 
record.  The investigational product dispensing record will remain in a secure locked area 
with access limited to the dispenser and the alternate(s).  A second individual with no other 
study  involvement will witness the preparation and dispensing process.  No other study  
personnel will be present in the designated dispensing room at the time of investigational 
product dispensing.  No other individuals will be able to see the investigational product in the 
bottle once the bottle cap is closed.
Page [ADDRESS_1194934]’s room.
5.5.Administration
Investigational product will be administered to the subject within [ADDRESS_1194935] with approximately 6- 8 ounces of room temperature water 
(Time=0). Subjects will swallow the study  medication whole, and will not manipulate or 
chew the medication prior to swallowing. 
5.6. Investigational Product Storage 
The investigator or an approved representative, eg, pharmacist, will ensure that all 
investigational products , including comparator and/or marketed products, are stored in a 
secured area with controlled access under require d storage conditions and in accordance w ith 
applicable regulatory  requirements
.
Investigational product sshould be stored in their original container sand in accordance with 
the label s.  
Any storage conditions stated in the IBwillbe superseded b y the storage conditions stated on 
the product l abel.
Site sy stems must be capable of measuring and documenting (for example, via a log), at a 
minimum, daily  minimum and maximum temperatures for all site storage locations (as 
applicable, including frozen, refrigerated ,and/or room -temperature products).   This should 
be captured from the time of investigational product receipt throughout the 
study .  Even for 
continuous- monitoring sy stems, a log or site procedure that ensures active evaluation for 
excursions should be available .  The intent is to ensure th at the minimum and maximum 
temperature is checked each business day  to confirm that no excursion occurred since the last 
evaluation and to provide the site with the capability  to store or view the minimum/maximum 
temperature for all non
-working day s upon r eturn to normal operations.  The operation of the 
temperature monitoring device and storage unit (for example, refrigerator), as applicable, 
should be regularl y inspected to ensure they are maintained in working order.  
Any excursions from the product lab el storage conditions should be reported to [COMPANY_007] upon 
discovery . The site should actively  pursue options for returning the product to the storage 
conditions described in the labeling , as soon as possible.  Deviations from the storage 
requirements, inclu ding any  actions taken, must be documented and reported to [COMPANY_007] .  
Once an excursion is identified, the investigational product must be quarantined and not used 
until [COMPANY_007] provides permission to use the investigational product.  It will not be consider ed a 
protocol deviation if [COMPANY_007] approves the use of the investigational product after the 
Page [ADDRESS_1194936] supplies.   All investigational products will be 
account ed for using a drug accountabilit y form/record.  
Upon receipt at the study site, the carton containing the investigational product will be stored 
unopened in the study treatment storage room.  The Principal I nvestigator or an appropriate 
designee, and a r epresentative of PCH will conduct an inventory and complete the study
treatment inventory record, preferabl y at stud y initiation, but prior to first subject first visit 
(FSFV).  Any interim shipments willbeinventoried by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_022] /her 
designee, and if possible, a representative of PCH.  For all interim shipments, a study
treatment inventory record will be completed. 
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_1075], upon dispensing the investigational 
product , must record the information in an investigational product dispensing/return log.  For 
accounting purposes and assessing subject compliance, a representative of PCH will review 
the 
investigational product dispensing/return log, inventory the investigational product, and 
inspect the storage facility at appropriate time intervals throughout the clinical investigation, 
depending on the length of the study .The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_857662]/or deficiency .
5.7.1. Destruction of Investigational Product Supplies 
All investigational product s shipped for this clinical trial will be returned to the Sponsor upon 
conclusion or termination of the study .  At the conclusion of the study , the Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_1075], and a repre sentative of PCH will inventory  all used 
and unused investigational product .  PCH will retain the original shipment documentation 
and inventory  record, and the I nvestigator will retain a copy  for his/her files.  All used 
investiga tional product (e mpty  containers), as well as all unused investigational product will 
then be returned to:

5.9. Rescue Medication
Rescue medications should be dispensed and administered b y an appropriately qualified 
member of the site in accordance with state and local laws , and insti tutional guidance.
Subjects not experiencing adequate relief after the one- hour time point evaluation may  be 
given tramadol hydrochloride (immediate release tablets) 50 to 100 mg orally , based on the 
discretion of the Investigator, as rescue medication.  I f needed, subjects may  receive up to 
2additional dose sof rescue medication ( ie, tramadol 50 to 100 mg orally  every  4 to 6 hours 
as needed [ prn] based on the discretion of the Investigator ) at the study  center ( ie, within 
8hours after dosing with study  medication).  The total maximum dose 
oftramadol, which 
may be taken at the study center, is 300 mg ( total daily  dose should not exceed 400 mg).
Alternativel y, an y subject not experiencing adequate relief after the one -hour time point 
evaluation may  be give ncodeine sulfate (immediate release tablets) 15 to 60 mg orally , 
based on the discretion of the Investigator, as rescue medication.  If needed, subjects may  
receive up to 2 additional dose s
of rescue medication ( ie, codeine sulfate 15 to 60 mg orally  
every 4 hours as needed ( prn)[based on the discretion of the Investigator]) at the study  center 
(ie, within 8 hours after dosing with study  medication). The total maximum dose of codeine
sulfate , which may  be taken at the study  center, is 180 mg (total daily dose should not exceed 
360 mg )
.
Subjects may  not take any  study  rescue medication home with them.
Subjects who take rescue medication during the course of the evaluation period will remain 
in the study  for the full 8-hour duration and continue to perform their efficacy  assessments.  
Subjects taking rescue medication within one hour after dosing will be considered 
dis
continued and must be replaced.  They will remain in the study  for the full 8-hour duration 
and continue to perform their efficacy  assessment s
.
The use of rescue medication will be recorded in the appropriate section of the CRF .  The 
date, time, name [CONTACT_857692], and reasons for use will be recorded .

molars; a single additional supernumerary  tooth may  be extracted if necessary ), and
The surgical trauma rating scale ;
The time of the last meal prior to surgery  will be noted in the source document only .
6.3.Study Period
Post-operatively , no ice packs may  be applied to the patient until completion of the [ADDRESS_1194940] -surgical 
pain at a level that meets the entry criteria for randomization (See Randomization Criteria ).  
At that time, subjects will be asked to complete the baseline 11-point Numerical Rating S cale 
and the 100 mm VAS PSR scale.
11-point Numerical Pain Severity  Rating (NPSR) ;
A minimum score of 5out of [ADDRESS_1194941] can enter the 
trial. The NPSR will be assigned a whole number value where 0= none and 10= 
worst possible pain.
VAS Pain Severity  Rating Scale (VAS PSR) ;
A minimum score of [ADDRESS_1194942] moderate pain at baseline in order to be randomized.  Subjects 
with scores <50 mm b y approximately 5 hours (ie, less than or equal to 5 hours, 
15 minutes) after surgery will not be randomized.
Subjects who do not reach a qualify ing baseline pain threshold (at leas t [ADDRESS_1194943] 50 mm on the VAS PSR) within approximately  5 hours (ie, 
less than or equal to 5 hours, 15 minutes) of completion of surgery  will not be randomized to 
receive investigational product .
Baseline vital signs (HR, BP, RR, and T) will also be measured and recorded and should be 
complete within approximately [ADDRESS_1194944] (consisting of 2 liquid- filled capsules) under 
double blind conditions. Investigational product must be administered within approximately  
7 minutes of baseline measurements.  The time of dosing “time 0” is recorded in the source 
and CRF.
When th e subject is administered study  medication at time 0, the Study  Coordinator will start 
two stopwatches (see Time to First Perceptible Relief and Time to Meaningful Relief for 
further details)
. 
Throughout the study  period, an assessment of s ymptoms should be completed for reporting
of adverse events b y asking the subjects to respond to a non- leading question such as “How 
do you feel?”
6.3.1. Post- baseline Assessment

Subjects will also evaluate the time to “First Perceptible” Relief b y depressing a stopwatch at 
the moment they  first begin to experience “perceptible” relief as well as 
the time to 
“Meaningful” Relief b y depressing a second stopwatch at the moment they  first begin to 
experience “meaningful” relief (see Time to First Perceptible Relief and Time to Meaningful 
Relief for further details).  These elapsed times will be recorded up to 8 hours after dosing, or 
until the time of (first) rescue medication use, whichever is sooner.
6.4.End of Study As sessments
At the 8-hour assessment for the stud y, ie ,after the last efficacy  assessment is collected and 
assuming there are no outstanding AEs of concern, the subject will undergo the following

Review of an y reported AE/SAEs;
Assess for c oncomitant treatments;
Discharge from clinical research unit ( CRU ).
Lack of completion of all or an y of the earl y termination procedures will not be viewed as 
protocol deviations so long as the subject’s safet y was preserved. The early  termination visit 
only applies to subjects who are randomized and then are prematurely  withdrawn from the 
study .
Withdrawal of consent :
Subjects who request to discontinue receipt of study  treatment will remain in the study  and 
must continue to be followed for protocol speci fied follow -up procedures. The only  
exception to this is when a subject specificall y withdraws consent for an y further contact 
[CONTACT_857682].
Subjects should notify  the investi gator in writing of the decision to withdraw consent from 
future follow -up, whenever possible. The withdrawal of consent should be explained in 
detail in the medical records by  [CONTACT_093], as to whether the withdrawal is only from 
further receipt of investigational product or also from study  procedures and/or post -treatment 
study  follow -up, and entered on the appropriate CRF page. In the event that vital status 
(whether the subject is alive or dead) is being measured, publicly  available information 
should be used to determine vital status only  as appropriatel y directed in accordance with 
local law.
Lost to 
follow -up: 
All reasonable efforts must be made to locate subjects to determine and report their ongoing
status. This includes follow- up with per sons authorized by  [CONTACT_74084]. Lost 
tofollow -up is defined by  [CONTACT_53981] y to reach the subject after a minimum of 2documented 
phone calls, faxes, or e -mails as well as lack of response b y the subject to 1registered mail 
letter. All a ttempts should be documented in the subject’s medical records. If it is 
determined that the subject has died, the site will use locally  permissible methods to obtain 
the date and cause of death. If the investigator’s use of a third -party representative t o assist 
in the follow -up portion of the study  has been included in the subject’s informed consent, 
then the investigator may use a sponsor -retained third -party representative to assist site staff 
with obtaining the subject’s contact [CONTACT_857683] p ublic vital status data necessary  to 
complete the follow -up portion of the study . The site staff and representative will consult 
publicly  available sources, such as public health registries and databases, in order to obtain 
updated contact [CONTACT_3031]. If, after all attempts, the subject remains lost to follow- up, then

Withdrawal From the Study  Due to Adverse Events section) or behavioral reasons, or the 
inabil ity of the subject to comply  with the protocol -required schedule of study  visits or 
procedures at a given study  site.
If a subject does not return for a scheduled visit, every  effort should be made to contact [CONTACT_1560]. All attempts to contact [CONTACT_857684]’s medical record.  In an y circumstance, every  effort 
should be made to document subject outcome, if possible.  The investigator should inquire 
about the reason for withdr awal, request that the subject return for a final visit, if applicable, 
and follow up with the subject regarding an y unresolved adverse e vents ( AEs)or serious 
adverse events (SAEs) .
If the subject withdraws from the study , and also withdraws consent for d isclosure of future 
information, no further evaluations should be performed, and no additional data should be 
collected.  The sponsor may  retain and continue to use any  data collected before such 
withdrawal of consent.
Subjects who withdraw from the study  may  be replaced at the discretion of the investigator 
upon consultation with the sponsor.  
7.ASSESSMENTS
Every  effort should be made to ensure that the protocol -
required tests and procedures are 
completed as described. However ,it is anticipated that from time to time there may  be 
circumstances outside of the control of the investigator that may  make it unfeasible to 
perform the test. In these cases the investigator will take all steps necessar y to ensure the 
safet y and well -being of the subject. When a p rotocol -required test cannot be performed ,the 
investigator will document the reason for this and any corrective and preventive actions that 
heor she has taken to ensure that normal processes are adhered to as soon as possible. The 
study  team will be inf ormed of these incidents in a timely  manner .

The 5 -point Categorical Pain Relief Rating (PRR) Scale will be completed at the times 
specified in the Schedule of Activities, and immediately  before rescue medication is taken 
(for the first time, as necessary ) or at the time of withdrawal, to evaluate pain relief in 
response to the question:
"How much relief do you have from your starting pain?"

Page 33Each category  on this scale will be assigned a whole number value of 0 (none), 1 (a little), 
2(some), 3 (a lot), or 4 (complete) and the corresponding number will be recorded in the 
CRF.
7.2.3. Time to First Perceptible Relief
When the subject is administere d study  medication at time [ADDRESS_1194954] its face covered; one will be labeled 
“first perceptible relief” and the other “meaningful relief.”  In an effort to determine the exact 
moment that the subject begins to obtain noticeable pain relief, the subjects will be given the 
stopwatch labeled “first perceptible relief” and will be instructed as follows:
“Stop the stopwatch when you first begin to feel any pain relieving effect whatsoever o f 
the drug.  That is, when you first feel a little relief.  This does not necessarily mean that 
you feel completely better, although you might, but when you first feel any difference in 
the pain that you have now.”
The elapsed time of this stopwatch will b e recorded in the CRF .  The stopwatch will remain 
active for [ADDRESS_1194955] begins to obtain meaningfu l pain 
relief, t he subjects will be given the stopwatch labeled “ meaningful relief” and instructed as 
follows:
“Stop this stopwatch when you have meaningful relief, that is, when the relief from the 
pain is meaningful to you.”
The elapsed time of this stop watch will be recorded in the CRF .  The stopwatch will remain 
active for [ADDRESS_1194956], or until rescue medication is administered.
7.2.5. Global Evaluation
At the time points specified in the Schedule of A ctivities (at the 8- hour time -point), or 
immediately  before taking rescue medication (for the first time, as necessary ), a Global 
Evaluation of the study  medication will be performed.  The Global Evaluation, on a 6 -point 
categorical scale, will be performed in res ponse to the following question:
"How would you rate this medication as a pain reliever?"
Very Poor        Poor         Fair         Good         Very Good         Excellent
Responses on this categorical scale will be assigned values of 0 (Very  Poor), 1 (poor), 
2(fair), 3 (good), 4 (very good) or 5 (Excellent) and the corresponding number will be 
recorded in the CRF.

measures should be taken after [ADDRESS_1194959] as well. When possible t he same arm 
(preferabl y the dominant arm) will be used throughout the study
. Subjects should be 
instructed not to speak during measurements.
The same properl y sized and calibrated blood pressure cuff will be used to measure BPeach 
time.  The use of an automated device for measuring BP and pulse rate is acceptable, 
although, when done manually, pulse rate will be measured in the brachial/radial artery  for at

sensitivity  will be performed at admission before investigational product administration at 
the baseline visit to confirm the subject has not become pregnant during the study.  
A negative pregnancy  test result is required before the subject may  receive the investigational 
product .  Pregnancy  tests will also be done whenever 1menstrual cy cle is missed during the 
active treatment period (or when potential pregnancy  is otherwise suspe cted) .  Pregnancy  
tests may  also be repeated if requested b y institutional review boards (I RBs)/ethics 
committees (ECs) or if required by  [CONTACT_427].
7.5.Contraception Check
Subjects need to affirm that they  meet adequate methods of contraception as out lined in the 
protocol. The investigator or his/her design ee will discuss with the subject the need to use 
highly  effective contraception consistently  and correctl y according to the schedule of 
activities (SOA) 
and document such conversation in the source document. In addition, the 
investigator or his/her design ee will instruct the subject to call immediately  if a selected 
contraception method is discontinued or if pregnancy  is known or suspected .

Page 368.ADVERSE EVENT REPORT ING
8.1.Requireme nts
The table below summarizes the requirements for recording safet y events on the CRF and for 
reporting safety  events on the Clinical Trial (CT) Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Report Form 
to [COMPANY_007] Safety .  These requirements are delineated for 3 ty pes of ev ents: (1) SAEs; (2) non -
serious adverse events (AEs); and (3) exposure to the investigational product under stud y 
during pregnancy  or breastfeeding, and occupational exposure.  
Safety Event Recorded on the CRF Reported on the CT SAE 
Report Form to [COMPANY_007] 
Safety Within [ADDRESS_1194962] 
under study  during 
pregnancy  or 
breastfeeding, and 
occupational exposureAll (regardless of whether 
associated with an AE), 
except occupation al 
exposureExposure during pregnancy , 
exposure via breastfeeding, 
occupational exposure 
(regardless of whether 
associated with an AE)
All observed or volunteered events regardless of treatment group or suspected causal 
relationship to the investigational product(s) will be reported as described in the following 
paragraphs.
Events listed in the table above that require reporting to [COMPANY_007] Safety  on the CT SAE Report 
Form within [ADDRESS_1194963] be made immediately , irrespective of the exten t of available 
event information.  This time frame also applies to additional new (follow -up) information on 
previously  forwarded reports.  I n the rare situation that the investigator does not become 
immediately  aware of the occurrence of an event, the inv estigator must report the event 
within 24 hours after learning of it and document the time of his/her first awareness of the 
event.
For each event, the investigator must pursue and obtain adequate information both to 
determine the outcome and to assess whe ther it meets the criteria for classification as an SAE 
(see the Serious Adverse Events section below).  In addition, the investigator may  be 
requested b y [COMPANY_007] Safety to obtain specific follow -up information in an expedited fash ion.  
This information is more detailed than that recorded on the CRF.  In general, this will include 
a description of the event in sufficient detail to allow for a complete medical assessment of 
the case and independent determination of possible causalit y.  An y information relevant to 
the event, such as concomitant medications and illnesses, must be provided.  I n the case of a 
Page [ADDRESS_1194964] SAE 
Report Form; additional source documents (eg, medical records, CRF, laboratory  data) are to 
be sent to [COMPANY_007] Safet y ONLY upon request.
As part of ongoing safet y reviews conducted b y the sponsor, an y non -serious AE that is 
determined b y the sponsor to be serious will be reported by [CONTACT_74094].  To assist 
in the determination of case seriousness, further information may  be requested from the 
investigator to provide clarity  and understanding of the e vent in the context of the clinical 
study .
8.1.1. Additional Details On Recording Adverse Events on the CRF
All events detailed in the table above will be recorded on the AE page(s) of the CRF.  I t 
should be noted that the CT SAE Report Form for reporting of SAE information is not the 
same as the AE page of the CRF.  When the same data are collected, the forms must be 
completed in a consistent manner.  AEs should be recorded using concise medical 
terminology  and the same AE term should be used on both the CRF and the CT SAE Report 
Form for reporting of SAE information.
8.1.2. Eliciting Adverse Event Information
The investigator is to record on the CRF all directly  observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously  
reported b y the stud y subject/parent(s)/legal guardian/legally accepta ble representative.  In 
addition, each study subject/parent(s)/legal guardian/legally acceptable representative will be 
questioned about the occurrence of AEs in a non -leading manner.
8.1.3. Withdrawal From the Study Due to Adverse Events (see Also the Subject 
Withdrawal Section
)
Withdrawal due to AEs should be distinguished from withdrawal due to other causes, 
according to the definition of AE noted below, and recorded on the CRF.  
When a subject withdraws from the study  because of an SAE, the SAE must be recorded on 
the CRF and reported, as appropriate, on the CT SAE Report Form, in accordance with the 
Requireme ntssection above.
8.1.4. Time Period for Collecting AE/SAE Information
The time perio d for actively  eliciting and collecting AEs and SAEs (“active collection 
period”) for each subject begins from the time the subject /parent(s)/legal guardian/le gally 
acceptable representative provides informed consent, which is obtained before the subject’ s 
participation in the study  (ie, before undergoing any  study -related procedure and/or receiving 
investigational product), through and including a minimum of 14(+3) calendar days after the 
last administration of the investigational product .  At Day 14 (or up to Day 17) following the 
last administration of study  medication (final telephone contact), the subject /parent(s)/legal 
guardian/le gall
y acceptable representative will be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] b y telephone to inquire about 
SAEs, including hospi[INVESTIGATOR_857665] y diagnosed chronic medical conditions since the 
day of the surgery  when the last study  medication was administered .

Final Protocol ,13 Jul 2016
Page 38For subjects who are screen failures, the active collection period ends when screen failure 
status is determined.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Reporting SAEs to [COMPANY_007] Safety
All SAEs occurring in a subject during the active collection period are reported to [COMPANY_007] 
Safety  on the CT SAE Report Form.
SAEs occurring in a subject after the active collection period has ended are reported to [COMPANY_007] 
Safety  if the investigator b ecomes aware of them; at a minimum, all SAEs that the 
investigator believes have at least a reasonable possibility  of being related to investigational 
product must be reported to [COMPANY_007] Safety .
Follow up by  [CONTACT_74095] a level acceptable to the investigator, and 
[COMPANY_007] concurs with that assessment.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Recording Non -serious AEs and SAEs on the CRF
During the active collection period, both
non-serious AEs and SAEs are recorded on the 
CRF.
Follow -up by  [CONTACT_47610] a level acceptable to the investigator, and [COMPANY_007] concurs with that assessment.
8.1.5. Causality Assessment
The investigator’s assessment of causalit y must be provided for all AEs (serious and non -
serious); the investigator must record the causal relationship on the CRF, and report such an 
assessment in accordance with the SAE reporting requirements, if applicabl e.  An 
investigator’s causalit y assessment is the determination of whether there exists a reasonable 
possibility  that the investigational product caused or contributed to an AE; generall y the facts 
(evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship s hould be provided.  If the 
investigator does not know whether or not the investigational product caused the event, then 
the event will be handled as “related to investigational product” for reporting purposes, as 
defined b y the sponsor.  If the investigato r's causality  assessment is “unknown but not 
related” to investigational product, this should be clearl y documented on study  records.  
In addition, if the investigator determines that an SAE is associated with study  procedures, 
the investigator must recor
d this causal relationship in the source documents and CRF, and 
report such an assessment in the dedicated section of the CT SAE Report Form and in 
accordance with the SAE reporting requirements.
8.1.6. Sponsor’s Reporting Requirements to Regulatory Authorities
AE reporting, including suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions, will be carried out 
in accordance with applicable local regulations.

medical device; the event need not necessaril y have a causal relationship with the treatment 
or usage.  Examples of AEs include, but are not limited to: 
Abnormal test findings;
Clinically  significant signs and sy mptoms;
Changes in phy sical examination findin gs;
Hypersensitivity ;
Progression/worsening of underl ying disease
Drug abuse;
Drug dependency .
Additionally , AEs may  include signs and s ymptoms resulting from:
Drug overdose;
Drug withdrawal;
Drug misuse; 
Drug interactions;
Extravasation;
Exposure during pregnancy  (EDP);
Exposure via breastfeeding;
Medication error;
Occupational exposure.
8.2.2. Abnormal Test Findings
Abnormal objective test findings should be recorded as AEs when an y of the following 
conditions are met: 
Test result is associated with accompan ying s ymptoms; and/or
Page 47

Caffeine with Ibuprofen 
B3741002
Final Protocol ,13 Jul 2016
Page 40Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention; 
and/or
Test result leads to a change in study  dosing (outside of any  protocol -specified dose 
adjustments) or discontinuation from the study , significa nt additional concomitant 
drug treatment, or other therap y; and/or
Test result is considered to be an AE b y the investigator or sponsor.
Merel y repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of an y of the above conditions, does not 
constitute an AE.  An y abnor mal test result that is determined to be an error does not require 
recording as an AE.
8.2.3. Serious Adverse Events
A serious adverse event is any  untoward medical occurrence at any  dose that:
Results in death;
Is life -threatening (immediate risk of death);
Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];
Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity  (substantial disruption of the 
ability  to conduct normal life functions);
Results in congenital anomaly /birth defect.
Or that is considered to be:
An important medical event.
Medical and scientific judgment is exercised in determining whether an event is an important 
medical event.  An important medical event may  not be immediately  life-threatening and/or 
result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  However, if it is determined that the event may  jeopardize 
the subject or may  require intervention to prevent one of the other AE outcomes, the 
important medical event should be reported as serious.
Examples of such events are intensive t reatment in an emergency  room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; 
or development of drug dependency  or drug abuse.

includes transfer within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4591]/intensive care unit (eg, from the psy chiatric 
wing to a medical floor , medical floor to a coronary  care unit, or neurological floor to a 
tuberculosis unit).  An emergency  room visit does not necessarily constitute a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; 
however, the event leading to the emergency  room visit is assessed for medical importance.

Admission for treatment of a preexisting condition not associated with the 
development of a new AE or with a worsening of the pree xisting condition (eg, for 
workup of a persistent pretreatment laboratory  abnormality );
Social admission (eg, subject has no place to sleep);
Administrative admission (eg, for yearly physical examination);
Protocol -specified admission during a study  (eg, f or a procedure required by  [CONTACT_8896]);
Optional admission not associated with a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_4596] (eg, for elective 
cosmetic surgery );
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4597] a medical AE;
Preplanned treatments or surgical procedures.  These should be noted in the baseline 
documentation for the entire protocol an d/or for the individual subject.
Page 49

Caffeine with Ibuprofen 
B3741002
Final Protocol ,13 Jul 2016
Page 42Diagnostic and therapeutic noninvasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery , should not 
be reported as SAEs.  However, the medical condition for which the procedure was 
performed should be reported if it meets the definition of an SAE.  For example, an acute 
appendicitis that begins during the reporting period should be reported if the SAE 
requirements are met, and the resulting appendectomy  shoul d be recorded as treatment of the 
AE.
8.3.Severity Assessment
If required on the AE page of the CRF, the investigator will use the adjectives MILD, 
MODERATE, or SEVERE to describe the maximum intensity  of the AE.  For purposes of 
consistency , these intensity  grades are defined as follows:
MILD Does not interfere with subject's usual function.
MODERATE Interferes to some extent with subject's usual function.
SEVERE Interferes significantl y with subject's usual function.
Note the distinction between the sever ity and the seriousness of an AE.  A severe event is not 
necessarily  an SAE.  For example, a headache may  be severe (interferes significantly  with 
the subject's usual function) but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of the 
criteria for SA Es, listed above.
8.4.Special Situations
8.4.1. Protocol -Specified Serious Adverse Events
Unless the investigator believes that there is a causal relationship between the 
investigational product and an event specified below, these events should not be 
reported to Pfi zer Safety by [CONTACT_421945].  These events are anticipated to 
occur commonl y in a population requiring surgical extraction . However, these events should 
still be recorded as AEs on the CRF.
Protocol -specified SAEs that will not normally  be repo rted to [COMPANY_007] Safet y in an expedited 
manner: 
Paresthesia;
Fracture of the mandible;
Fracture of the maxilla;
Oroantral communication.
Should an aggregate analysis indicate that these prespecified events occur more frequently  
than expected, eg, based on epi[INVESTIGATOR_75144], literature, or other data, then this will be 
submitted and reported in accordance with [COMPANY_007]’s safet y reporting requirements.  Aggregate 
analyses of safet y data will be performed on a regular basis per internal standard operating 
procedures.

Page 438.4.2. Potential Cases of Drug- Induced Liver Injury
Humans exposed to a drug who show no sign of liver injury  (as determined by  [CONTACT_20023]) are termed “tolerators,” while those who show transient liver injury , but adapt 
are termed “adap tors.”  In some subjects, transaminase elevations are a harbinger of a more 
serious potential outcome.  These subjects fail to adapt and therefore are "susceptible" to 
progressive and serious liver injury , commonly  referred to as drug- induced liver injury  
(DILI).  Subjects who experience a transaminase elevation above 3 times the upper limit of 
normal ( ×ULN) should be monitored more frequently  to determine if they are an “adaptor” 
or are “susceptible.”
In the majority of DILI cases, elevations in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) precede total bilirubin (TBili) elevations (>2 ×ULN) by  [CONTACT_74097].  The increase in TBili ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_1306] y occurs while AST/ALT is/are still elevated 
above 3 ×ULN (ie, AST/AL T and TBili v alues will be elevated within the same lab sample).  
In rare instances, b y the time TBili elevations are detected, AST/ALT values might have 
decreased.  This occurrence is still regarded as a potential DILI.  Therefore, abnormal 
elevations in either AST OR ALT in addition to TBili that meet the criteria outlined below 
are considered potential DILI (assessed per Hy ’s law criteria) cases and should alway s be 
considered important medical events, even before all other possible causes of liver injury 
have been e xcluded.
The threshold of laboratory  abnormalities for a potential DILI case depends on the subject’s 
individual baseline values and underl ying conditions.  Subjects who present with the 
following laboratory  abnormalities should be evaluated further as pot ential DILI (Hy ’s law) 
cases to definitivel y determine the etiology of the abnormal laboratory  values:
Subjects with AST/AL T and TBili baseline values within the normal range who 
subsequently  present with AST OR AL T values >3 ×ULN AND a TBili value 
>2× ULN with no evidence of hemol ysis and an alkaline phosphatase value 
<2×ULN or not available;
For subjects with baseline AST OR ALT ORTBili values above the ULN, the 
following threshold values are used in the definition mentioned above, as needed, 
dependi ng on which values are above the ULN at baseline:
Preexisting AST or ALT baseline values above the normal range: AST or ALT 
values >2 times the baseline values AND >3 ×ULN; or >8 ×ULN (whichever is 
smaller).
Preexisting values of TBili above the normal r ange: TBili level increased from 
baseline value b y an amount of at least 1 × ULN orif the value reaches
>3 × ULN (whichever is smaller).
Rises in AST/AL T and TBili separated b y more than a few weeks should be assessed 
individually  based on clinical judgme nt; any  case where uncertainty  remains as to whether it 
represents a potential Hy’s law case should be reviewed with the sponsor.  
Page [ADDRESS_1194966] and AL T and TBili, laboratory  tests should 
include albumin, creatine kinase (CK), di rect and indirect bilirubin, gamma -glutamyl 
transferase (GGT), prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR), total bile 
acids, alkaline phosphatase and acetaminophen drug and/or protein adduct levels.  
Consideration should also be given to dr awing a separate tube of clotted blood and an 
anticoagulated tube of blood for further testing, as needed, for further contemporaneous 
analyses at the time of the recognized initial abnormalities to determine etiology .  A detailed 
history , including releva nt information, such as review of ethanol, acetaminophen (either b y 
itself or as a coformulated product in prescription or over -the-counter medications) , 
recreational drug, supplement (herbal) use and consumption, family  history , sexual history , 
travel history , history  of contact [CONTACT_4490] a jaundiced person, surgery , blood transfusion, history  
of liver or allergic disease, and potential occupational exposure to chemicals, should be 
collected.  Further testing for acute hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E infection and liver imaging 
(eg, biliary  tract) may  be warranted. 
All cases demonstrated on repeat testing as meeting the laboratory  criteria of AST/AL T and 
TBili elevation defined above should be considered potential DILI (Hy ’s law) cases if no 
other reason for the liver function test ( LFT)abnormalities has y et been found.  Such 
potential DILI (Hy’s law) cases are to be reported as SAEs, irrespective of availability 
of all the results of the investigations performed to determine etiology of the LFT 
abnormalities.  
A potential DILI (Hy ’s law) case becomes a confirmed case onl y after all results of 
reasonable investigations have been received and have excluded an alternative etiology .
8.4.3. Exposure to the Investigational Product During Pregnancy or Breastfeeding, and 
Occupat ional Exposure
Exposure to the investigational product under study  during pregnancy  or breastfeeding and 
occupational exposure are reportable to [COMPANY_007] Safety  within 24 hours of investigator 
awareness.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Exposure During Pregnancy
For both unapproved/unlicensed products and for marketed products, an exposure during 
pregnancy  (EDP) occurs if:
A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or having been 
exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the investigational 
product; or the female becomes or is found to be pregnant after discontinuing and/or 
being exposed to the investigational product;
Page 52

Caffeine with Ibuprofen 
B3741002
Final Protocol ,13 Jul 2016
Page 45An example of environmental exposure would be a case involving direct contact 
[CONTACT_4490] a [COMPANY_007] product in a pregnant woman (eg, a n urse reports that she is pregnant 
and has been exposed to chemotherapeutic products).
A male has been exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the 
investigational product prior to or around the time of conception and/or is exposed 
during his partner’s pregnancy .
If a subject or subject’s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the subject’s 
treatment with the investigational product, the investigator must report this information to 
[COMPANY_007] Safety  on the CT SAE Report Form an d an EDP supplemental form, regardless of 
whether an SAE has occurred.
  In addition, the investigator must submit information 
regarding environmental exposure to a [COMPANY_007] product in a pregnant woman (eg, a subject 
reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to a cy totoxic product by [CONTACT_31061][INVESTIGATOR_4598]) to [COMPANY_007] Safety  using the EDP supplemental form.  This must be done irrespective 
of whether an AE has occurred and within 24 hours of awareness of the exposure.  The 
information submitted should include the anticipated date of delivery  (see below for 
information related to termination of pregnancy ).
Follow -up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy  and its outcome for 
all EDP reports with an unknown outcome.  The investigator wil l follow the pregnancy  until 
completion (or until pregnancy  termination) and notify  [COMPANY_007] Safet y of the outcome as a 
follow -up to the initial EDP supplemental form.  In the case of a live birth, the structural 
integrity  of the neonate can be assessed at t he time of birth.  In the event of a termination, the 
reason(s) for termination should be specified and, if clinically  possible, the structural 
integrity  of the terminated fetus should be assessed by  [CONTACT_4692] (unless pre -
procedure test findi ngs are conclusive for a congenital anomaly  and the findings are 
reported).
If the outcome of the pregnancy  meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy , 
spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomal y [in a 
live-born bab y, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise, or a neonatal death]), the 
investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs.
Additional information about pregnancy  outcomes that are reported to [COMPANY_007] Safet y as SAEs 
follows: 
Spontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and missed abortion;
Neonatal deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_1194967].

Page 46Additional information regarding the EDP may  be requested by  [CONTACT_456].  Further follow-
up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case -by-case basi s (eg, follow -up on preterm 
infants to identify  developmental delay s).  In the case of paternal exposure, the investigator 
will provide the subject with the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to deliver to 
his partner.  The investigator must docu ment in the source documents that the subject was 
given the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to provide to his partner.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Exposure During Breastfeeding
Scenarios of exposure during breastfeeding must be reported, irrespective of the presence of 
an associated SAE, to [COMPANY_007] Safet y within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness, using the 
CT SAE Report Form.  An exposure during breastfeeding report is not created when a [COMPANY_007] 
drug specifically  approved for use in breastfeeding women (eg, vitamins) is administered in 
accord with authorized use.  However, if the infant experiences an SAE associated with such 
a drug’s administration, the SAE is reported together with the exposure during breastfeeding.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Occupational Exposure
An occupational exposure occ urs when, during the performance of job duties, a person 
(whether a healthcare professional or otherwise) gets in unplanned direct contact [CONTACT_8898], which may  or may  not lead to the occurrence of an AE.
An occupational exposure is reported to Pfize r Safety  within 24 hours of the investigator’s 
awareness, using the CT SAE Report Form, regardless of whether there is an associated 
SAE.  Since the information does not pertain to a subject enrolled in the study , the 
information is not recorded on a CRF; however, a copy of the completed CT SAE Report 
Form is maintained in the investigator site file.
8.4.4. Medication Errors 
Other exposures to the investigational product under study  may  occur in clinical trial settings, 
such as medication errors.

[IP_ADDRESS]. Medication Errors
Medication errors may  result from the administration or consumption of the investigational 
product b y the wrong subject, or at the wrong time, or at the wrong dosage strength .
Medication errors include :
Medication errors involving subject exposure to the investigational product;

Page 47Potential medication errors or uses outside of what is foreseen in the protocol that do 
or do not involve the participating subject.
Such medication errors occurring to a stud y participant are to be captured on the medication 
error page of the CRF, which is a specific version of the AE page.
In the event of a medication dosing error, the sponsor should be notified immediately .
Whether or not the medication error is accompanied by  [CONTACT_1149], as determined by  [CONTACT_1275], the medication error is recorded on the medicatio n error page of the CRF and, if 
applicable, an y associated AE(s), serious and non -serious, are recorded on an AE page of the 
CRF.
Medication errors should be reported to [COMPANY_007] Safety within [ADDRESS_1194968] SAE Report 
Form only when associated with an S AE.
9. DATA ANALYSIS/STATIS TICAL METHODS
Detailed methodolog y for summary  and statistical anal yses of the data collected in this study  
is outlined here and further detailed in a s tatistical analysis plan(SAP) , which will be 
maintained by  [CONTACT_1034].  The SAP may modify  what is outlined in the protocol where 
appropriate ; however, any  major modifications of the primary  endpoint definition s or their 
analyses will also be reflected in a protocol amendment.
9.1.Sample Size Determination
One hundred forty-eight (148) subjects in each of the I BU with caffeine and I BU treatment 
groups will assure at least 85% power to detect a difference of 10.[ADDRESS_1194969] 85% power to detect a difference of 
14.83 units in SPRI D 0-8 between e ach active treatment and placebo at the 5% significance 
level (two
-sided). 
Thus, a total of 346 (148 for each active treatment and 50 for the placebo) subjects are 
required to complete the study  per protocol. To allow for 10% drop -outs, a total of 
approxi matel y 385 (165 for each active treatment group and 55 for the placebo) subjects will 
be enrolled.
9.2.Efficacy Analysis
9.2.1. Analysis Populations
[IP_ADDRESS]. Primary Analysis Set
The full anal ysis set ( FAS) will be the primary  analy sis population and it 
is defined as all 
randomized subjects who dosed with the study  medication and provided a baseline 
assessment .
Page 55

Caffeine with Ibuprofen 
B3741002
Final Protocol ,13 Jul 2016
Page [IP_ADDRESS]. ‘Per Protocol’ Analysis Set
The ‘per -protocol’ anal ysis set will include all subjects who completed the study  per protocol 
(evaluable subjects). Thus, this analy sis set will exclude an y subject swho were discontinued 
from the study , or had a significant protocol violation.  The subjects who will be excluded 
from the ‘per -protocol’ analy sis set will be documented prior to breaking of the study  blind . 
If the per protocol population consists of 90% or more of the FAS subject population, a per 
protocol anal ysis will not be performed.
9.2.2. Analysis of the Primary Endpoint 
The primary  endpoint SPRI D 0-8 will be anal yzed using an analysis of covariance
(ANC OVA) model with treatment, gender, and baseline pain severit y terms in the 
model. Ninety  five percent (95%) confidence limits for the treatment difference will 
be reported.
9.2.3. Analysis of Secondary Endpoints
The summary  scores of SPI D, TOTPAR and SPRID from 0-2, 0-4, 0- [ADDRESS_1194970] -dosing time point will be anal yzed 
using ANCOVA with treatment, gender, and baseline numerical pain severity  terms 
in the model. Ninety  five percent (95%) confidence limits for the treatment 
difference will be reported.
Time to onset of meaningful relief will be anal yzed using the Gehan -Wilcoxon test to
compare treatments, stratify ing by  [CONTACT_857686]  (moderate or 
severe) factors. It will also be summarized using the Kaplan- Meier me thod and 
display ed graphically  where app ropriate. Confidence intervals for the median will be 
reported b y treatment.
Time to onset of first perceptible relief, confirmed by  [CONTACT_88965], and
duration of relief as measure dby [CONTACT_857687], will be analy zed 
using the Gehan -Wilcoxon test to compare treatments, stratify ing by  [CONTACT_857688]  (moderate or severe) factors. They  will also be summarized 
using the Kaplan
-Meier method and displayed graphicall y where appr opriate. 
Confidence intervals for the median will be reported by [CONTACT_3148].
9.2.4. Adjustment for Multiple Comparisons
No multiple comparisons areplanned for primary  endpoint .
9.2.5. Derivation of Endpoints
PID: based on the 11- point NPSR scale ranging from 0 ( ”no pain” ) to 10 ( ”worst 
possible pain”), will be derived b y subtracting the score at each post- dosing time 
point from the baseline score, so that a higher positive value is indicative of greater
improvement.
PRID: will be calculated by  [CONTACT_857689] a t each post -dosing time
point.

SPRI Dt, time -weighted sum of PRI D scores from time 0 to t (where t=2, 4,

9.2.6. Data Convention s/ Handling of Missing Data
Efficacy  assessments are scheduled to be completed at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 
8hours post-dose and the anal yses will be done corresponding to these time points. Because 
some subjects may  complete their assessments at times differing from the scheduled time 
points, each such score will be adjusted so as to reflect more accuratel y the score that would 
have been observed had it been recorded at the scheduled time point. For each analy sis time 
point, time windows will be created, using a width of ±5 minutes for time points which are 
less than one hour apart, and a width of ±[ADDRESS_1194971] will be assigned to 
analyzed time points according to these windows. The assignment rules will be as follows:
All assessments completed more than a minute after a subject takes the first dose of 
rescue medication will be ignored. Remaining efficacy  scores subsequent to the time 
of rescue medication will be extrapolated (see below for method of extrapolation).
If an assessment is performed within a time point window, the corresp onding value 
will be assigned to that time point (eg, an assessment performed an ywhere between 
115 and 125 minutes, regardless of when it was scheduled, will be assigned to the 
2-hour time point). If more than one value falls within a window (this may inc lude 
assessments completed at the time of rescue medication), a simple average of the 
values will be used.
If a particular time point has no value within its window, then a value will be 
assigned by  [CONTACT_857690]. If an assessment is available before 
and after the time point window, then a value will be interpolated b y calculating the 
weighted ave rage of the values immediately  p
receding and subsequent to the time 
point window, with weights inversely  proportional to the duration betw een the 
analyzed time point and the actual time.
If a window is empt y and no subsequent scores are available, a value will be assigned 
to the empty  window via extrapolation. The extrapolated value will depend on 
whether rescue medication was taken or whether the subject dropped out due to lack 
of efficacy  during or before the particular time point’s window. If so, the worse of 
the preceding score (this may  be the assessment completed at the time of rescue 
medication) and the baseline score will be assigned as the pain severity  scores, and a
score of 0 (no relief) as the pain relief score. If the missing data are not due to subject 
taking rescue medication, or discontinuation due to lack of efficacy , then the last 
observation will be carried forward for the pain severity  scores and the pain relief 
scores.
Page [ADDRESS_1194972] and/or after study  completion, the investigator site may  be subject to 
review b y the IRB/EC , and/or to quality  assurance audits performed by  [CONTACT_4618], or companies 
working with or on behalf of [COMPANY_007], and/or to inspection by  [CONTACT_8901].
The investigator(s) will notify  [COMPANY_007] or its agents immediately  of any  regulatory  inspection 
notification in relation to the study .Furthermore, the investigator will cooperate with [COMPANY_007] 
or its agents to prepare the investigator site for the inspection and will allow [COMPANY_007] or its 
agent, whenever feasible, to be present during the inspection.  The investigator site and 
investigator will promptly resolve an y discrepancies that are identified between the stud y 
data and the subject's medical records.  The investigator will promptly  provi de copi[INVESTIGATOR_74040].  Before response submission to the regulatory 
authorities, the investigator will provide [COMPANY_007] or its agents with an opportunity  to review 
and comment on responses to any  such findings.
It is im portant that the investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available during the 
monitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the 
process.
11.DATA HANDLING AND RE CORD KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]
11.1. Case Report Forms/Electronic Da ta Record
As used in this protocol, the term CRF should be understood to refer to either a paper form or 
an electronic data record or both, depending on the data collection method used in this study .
A CRF is required and should be completed for each inclu ded subject.  The completed 
original CRFs are the sole propert y of [COMPANY_007] and should not be made available in any form to 
third parties, except for authorized representatives of [COMPANY_007] or appropriate regulatory  
authorities, without written permission from [COMPANY_007].
The investigator has ultimate responsibility  for the collection and reporting of all clinical, 
safet y
,and laboratory  data entered on the CRFs and any  other data collection forms (source 
documents) and ensuring th at they  are accurate, authentic /original, attributable, complete, 
consistent, legible, timely  (contemporaneous), enduring , and available when required.  The 
CRFs must be signed by  [CONTACT_110292]. Any correcti ons to entries made in the CRFs or source 
documents must be dated, initialed ,and explained (if necessary ) and should not obscure the 
original entry . 
In most cases, the source documents are the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_153833].  In these 
cases , data collected on the CRFs must match the data in those charts. 
In some cases, the CRF may  also serve as the source document.  In these cases, a document 
should be available at the investigator site and at [COMPANY_007] that clearl y identifies those data th at 
will be recorded on the CRF, and for which the CRF will stand as the source document.
Page [ADDRESS_1194973] Retention
To enable evaluations and/or inspections/ audits from regulatory  authorities or [COMPANY_007], the 
investigator agrees to keep records, including the identity of all participating subjects 
(sufficient information to link records, eg,CRFs and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]), all original signed 
informed consent /assent documents , copi[INVESTIGATOR_4600], safety reporting forms, source 
documents, and detailed records of treatment d isposition, and adequate documentation of 
relevant correspondence ( eg,letters, meeting minutes, and telephone call reports).  The 
records should be retained by  [CONTACT_52248] I CH guidelines, according to 
local regulations, or as specified in the clinical study agreement (CSA) , whichever is longer.
If the investigator becomes unable for an y reason to continue to retain study records for the 
required period ( eg, retirement, relocation), [COMPANY_007] should be prospectivel y notified.  The 
study  r
ecords must be transferred to a designee acceptable to [COMPANY_007] , such as another 
investigator, another institution, or an independent third party  arranged by  [CONTACT_4618]. 
Investigator records must be kept for a minimum of [ADDRESS_1194974] obtain [COMPANY_007]'s written permission before disposing of an y records, 
even if retention requirements have been met.
12.ETHICS
12.1. Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee
It is the responsibility  of the investigator to have prospective approval of the study  protocol, 
protocol amendments, informed consent /assent documents , and other relevant documents, eg,
recruitment advertisements, if applicable, from the I RB/EC .  All correspondence with the
IRB/EC should be retained in the investigator f ile.  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_1099]/EC approvals should be 
forwarded to [COMPANY_007].
The only  circumstance in which an amendment may  be initiated prior to IRB/EC approval is 
where the change is neces sary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the subjects.  In 
that event, the investigator must notify  the IRB/EC and [COMPANY_007] in writing immediately  after 
the implementation.
12.2. Ethical Conduct of the Study
The study  will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, legal and regulatory  
requirements, and the general principles set forth in the I nternational Ethical Guidelines for 
Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects (Council for International Organizations of 
Medical Sciences 2002), ICH Guideline for Good Clinical Practice , and the Declaration of 
Helsinki .

maintain high standards of confidentialit y and protection of subjects’ personal data consistent 
with applicable privacy  laws .
The informed consent /assent document sand an y subject recruitment materials must be in 
compliance with ICH GCP, local regulatory  requi rements, and legal requirements , including 
applicable privacy  laws .
The informed consent /assent document s used during the informed consent process and any  
subject recruitment materials must be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_4618] , approved b y the 
IRB/EC before 
use, and available for inspection.
The investigator must ensure that each study  subject ,or his or her legall y acceptable 
representative ,or parent(s) or legal guardian if a minor ,is fully  informed about the nature 
and objectives of the study and possib le risks associated with participation.  
Whenever consent is obtained from a subject’s legally  acceptable representative /parent(s) or 
legal guardian, the subject’s assent (affirmative agreement) must subsequently  be obtained 
when the subject has the capac ity to provide assent, as determined by  [CONTACT_1201]/EC.  If the 
investigator determines that a subject’s decisional capacity  is so limited he/she cannot 
reasonabl y be cons ulted, then, as permitted b y the IRB/EC and consistent with local 
regulatory  and legal re quirements, the subject’s assent may  be waived with source 
documentation of the reason assent was not obtained.  If the stud y subject does not provide 
hisor herown consent, the source documents must record why the sub ject did not provide 
consent (eg, min or, decisionally  impaired adult), how the investigator determined that the 
person signing the consent was the subject’s legally  acceptable representative, the consent 
signer’s relat ionship to the study  subject (eg, parent, spouse) , and that the subject’s assent 
was obtained or waived.  If assent is obtained verbally , it must be documented in the source 
documents .
If the stud y includes minor subjects who reach the age of majorit y during the study, as 
recognized under local law, they  must reconsent as adults to remain in the study .  If the 
enrollment of emancipated minors is permitted by  [CONTACT_74100], the IRB/EC , and 
local law, they  must provide documentation of legal status to give consent without the 
permission of a parent or legal guardian.

guardian and the subject’s assent, when applicable ,before an y stud y-specific activity  is 
performe d,unless a waiver of informed consent has been granted by  [CONTACT_2717]/EC . The 
investigator will retain the original of each subject's signed consent /assent 
document .
At the conclusion of the study  treatment period, subjects must return all products to the site. 
No products should be given to the subjects or legal guardian or parents to take home.
12.4. Reporting of Safety Issues and S erious Breaches of the Protocol or ICH GCP
In the event of an y prohibition or restriction imposed (ie, clini cal hold) b y an applicable 
regulatory  authorit y in any area of the world, or if the investigator is aware of any  new 
information that 
might influence the evaluation of the benefits and risks of the investigational 
product, [COMPANY_007] should be informed immedia tely.  
In addition, the investigator will inform [COMPANY_007] immediately  of any  urgent safet y measures 
taken b y the investigator to protect the study subjects against an y immediate hazard, and of 
any serious breaches of this protocol or of ICH GCP that the investigator becomes aware of.
13.DEFINITION OF END OF TRIAL
The end of trial is defined as the last subject last visit (L SLV).
14.SPONSOR DISCONTINUAT ION CRITERIA
Premature termination of this study  may  occur because of a regulatory  authority  decision, 
change in opi[INVESTIGATOR_1100]/EC , orinvestigational product safety  problems, or at the 
discretion of [COMPANY_007].  In addition, [COMPANY_007] retains the right to discontinue development of the 
fixed -
dose combination of ibuprofen with caffeine at an y time.
If a stud y is prematu rely terminated, [COMPANY_007] will promptly  notify  the investigator.  After 
notification, the investigator must contact [CONTACT_76626][INVESTIGATOR_4601]  
(if applicable) within [ADDRESS_1194977] extent possible.

for the application of manua l suctioning, assisted coughing maneuvers or other methods of airway management. 
These methods are cumbersome, generally uncomfortable and require trained personnel. These individuals lack 
an effective cough mechanism due to paralysis of their expi[INVESTIGATOR_696] m uscles. Since the spi[INVESTIGATOR_739524], the motoneurons of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_739525]. Therefore, the expi[INVESTIGATOR_739526]. 
In a single site, pi[INVESTIGATOR_14737] [ADDRESS_1010539] stimulation (SCS) to restore an effective cough, a method which involves the 
surgical placement of disc electrodes through laminotomy incisions. We demonstrated that this method is successful in achieving an effective means of expi[INVESTIGATOR_160041], as demonstrated by [CONTACT_739571][INVESTIGATOR_739527]. Importantly, this technique facilitates secretion 
removal, reduces the need for caregiver support, reduces the incidence of respi[INVESTIGATOR_739528]. While successful, electrode placement requires an invasive and costly  procedure. Consequently, many 
individuals were unwilling to pursue this technique. Based upon the results of animal and human studies, it is our

hypothesis that comparable activation of the expi[INVESTIGATOR_739529] a needle, eliminating the need for the invasive laminotomy procedure and can be 
performed on an out -patient basis. This latter procedure would significantly shorten surgical time, lessen the 
degree of surgery, shorten recover y time, reduce costs, and thereby, increase patient and physician acceptance of 
this technique. The efficacy of SCS with wire leads will be assessed in 16 subjects with SCI, in terms of the capacity of this method to activate the expi[INVESTIGATOR_109458], restor e an effective cough mechanism and achieve 
significant clinical benefits related to secretion management. Given the significant heterogeneity of this orphan population, subjects will serve as their own controls to evaluate the success of this technique. If  successful, the 
wire lead system will provide a minimally invasive method of restoring cough and has the potential to significantly improve life quality. Ultimately, restoration of an effective cough with SCS has the potential to significantly improve the  morbidity and mortality associated with respi[INVESTIGATOR_739530]. 
This study will also provide the data necessary for a multi -center trial of this technique leading to eventual FDA 
approval.  
 
Primary Aims:  
 
1. Determine the utility of lower thoracic SCS with wire leads to produce large positive airway 
pressures and high peak expi[INVESTIGATOR_739531] . 
 
2. Evaluate the capacity of this technique to provide an effective means of cleari ng airway 
secretions, reduce the need for caregiver support, reduce the incidence of respi[INVESTIGATOR_739532]. 
 
Secondary Aims:  
 
1. Determine if the use of wire leads for restoration of cough has greater appeal to patients with 
SCI and is associated with less risk and cost compared to the current method of SCS to restore 
cough. 
 
2. Determine if the information from this study provides the necessary data to perform a multi-
center trial and obtain FDA approval of this device . 
 
V. Description and Rationale  
 
Problem.  
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_739533] (SCI) during the acute phase and also during later years.
 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_739534], these patients 
frequently develop atelectasi s, bronchitis and pneumonia. In epi[INVESTIGATOR_739535] 5,[ADDRESS_1010540], patients with SCI are ~[ADDRESS_1010541] secretions include active suctioning, manual assistance by [CONTACT_739572]/or use of a mechanical insufflation- exsufflation device. Each of these methods requires 
provider -patient coordination and is costly and labor intensive, requiring the constant presence of trained 
personnel. Moreover, despi[INVESTIGATOR_739536], respi[INVESTIGATOR_739537] a major 
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_739523] #: IRB15 -[ZIP_CODE]  
Date Approved: 4/10/[ADDRESS_1010542] a functional cough. These include: A) Gravity . By [CONTACT_115564], the 
patient is placed in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_739538] a dependent position. The position of the body is 
rotated to allow secretions from different lobes of the lung to drain by [CONTACT_739573]. B) Active 
Suctioning. By [CONTACT_739574] a catheter either through the nasopharynx or 
tracheostomy to suction the airways with the use of a mechanical pump. This method is generally successful for removal of heavy secretions from the large airways. C) Assisted Cough. This method involves the application of 
external force to the abdominal wall, usually by a therapi[INVESTIGATOR_739539]. The patient rests in a reclining position, and the abdominal wall is compressed forcefully to increase abdominal pressure and, consequently, intrathoracic pressure to ex pel secretions.  
 Unfortunately, each of these methods has significant limitations which limit their effectiveness. The removal of secretions by [CONTACT_739575]. Active suctioning clears secretions from the large airways, but does not allow active 
removal of secretions from small airways where they are produced and often create problems with gas exchange. Furthermore, this method can result in tracheal injury and irritation causing recurrent hemoptysis and patient discomfort. The assisted cough method can increase intrathoracic airway pressures to a small extent (10- 15%). 
However, unlike natural cough production, this method does not result in unifor m distribution of pressure within 
the intrathoracic cavity and, therefore, has limited effectiveness in many patients. In addition, this method is labor intensive requiring the assistance of a therapi[INVESTIGATOR_739540].  
 The deposition of material within the tracheobronchial tree occurs during various normal physical phenomena 
including inspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], sedimentation, gas movement, turbulence and electrostatic forces. Most secretions are usually removed by [CONTACT_739576], functioning as a mucociliary escalator. This mechanism is quickly overwhelmed when secretions become excessive; in which case, cough becomes the primary means of secretion removal. For patients with spi[INVESTIGATOR_739541], active suctioning is usually required to remove secretions on a regular basis, usually several times per day.   Currently, therefore, there is no adequate method for achieving normal cough in this pat ient population. As a 
consequence, they suffer from the frequent development of respi[INVESTIGATOR_11800], particularly respi[INVESTIGATOR_6014].  
 
Innovation  
There are three potential methods by [CONTACT_739577][INVESTIGATOR_739542]: 1) high -
frequency magnetic stimulation (MS), 2) surface abdominal muscle stimulation (SS) and 3) lower thoracic SCS. First, MS is an experimental device which can be applied to the lower back to activate the neural pathways innervating the e xpi[INVESTIGATOR_109458].
 While this technique has the important advantage that it can be applied non-
invasively, previous studies evaluating this technique in tetraplegic patients did not demonstrate significant increases in airway pressure generation. Moreover, this method has significant limitations including the 
generation of substantial heat at the stimulating coil and associated risk of thermal injury and lack of portability. With SS, substantial airway pressures can be generated with electrodes with very large surface areas.  However, as with MS, this method carries the risk of thermal injury, skin irritation and breakdown. Finally, we have previously shown that SCS using disc electrodes results in activation of the expi[INVESTIGATOR_739543], in the range of those observed during a 
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_739523] #: IRB15 -[ZIP_CODE]  
Date Approved: 4/10/[ADDRESS_1010543] injured  
(SCI)  patients should reduce the incidence of atelectasis and respi[INVESTIGATOR_739544].  Hypothesis , therefore, that spi[INVESTIGATOR_739545] (SCS) with wire leads, which can be inserted via minimally 
invasive techniques can a) be applied safely without the development of neural injury, b) result in sufficient activation of the expi[INVESTIGATOR_739546], and c) have a significant clinical impact related to secretion clearance on subjects with SCI.

VII. Methods and procedures  
 
General study design  
 Preliminary Assessment  
Prior to surgery, a history and physical examination will be completed. The following laboratory studies will be obtained: complete blood count with differential; comprehensive metabolic panel, which includes glucose, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine and ca lcium, total protein and albumin; prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time 
and INR; and urinalysis with urine culture and sensitivity. A standard [ADDRESS_1010547] equipment. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_739547] (MIP) and maximal ex pi[INVESTIGATOR_27111] (MEP) using a digital meter. The best of 3- [ADDRESS_1010548]. Tabbaa (staff anesthesiologist) and/or [CONTACT_739584] 
(staff neurosurgeon) will perform the implantation of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_739548] (Ardiem, Inc; Indiana, PA) and radiofrequency receiver (Finetech Medical; London, England). A separate member of the anesthesiology team will be present to monitor hemodynamic and ventilatory status. Patients will receive moderate IV sedation, which is the clinical standard for the implantation of epi[INVESTIGATOR_739549].  The subjects will be  placed in the prone posture 
with a pi[INVESTIGATOR_739550], prepared and draped. Under fluoroscopic guidance, the L1- L2 interspace 
will be identified. One and one -half vertebral levels caudal and lateral to the midline, the skin will be infiltrated  
with lidocaine 1% with bicarbonate using a 25- gauge needle. An incision will be made to the depth of the 
subcutaneous fascia and a size [ADDRESS_1010549] Stimulation with Wire Leads to Restore Cough

Date Approved: 4/10/[ADDRESS_1010550] (or telemetry unit for subjects with sleep apnea). Routine post -operative surgical care will be provided. The subject 
will be monitored for any signs of bleeding or infection. The subject is expected to be discharged the next day.  
 The potential complications of this procedure include infection and bleeding. The incidence of each of these is 
generally considered to be less than 1%. [CONTACT_739585] has performed parallel wire lead placement routinely for other indications of SCS for more than [ADDRESS_1010551]

- Airway pressure .  Changes in airway pressure during expi[INVESTIGATOR_739552]. Prior to SCS, the subject will be asked to relax completely to assure absence of respi[INVESTIGATOR_160041]. SCS will be applied for 0.6- 0.8s during which time airway pressure will be recorded during airway occlusion.  
- Expi[INVESTIGATOR_739553] . Peak expi[INVESTIGATOR_739554] a useful index of cough efficacy and will be 
monitored in each subject. Inspi[INVESTIGATOR_739555].  Peak expi[INVESTIGATOR_739556]. 
- Effects of lung volume changes .  Airway pressure generation will be assessed at both FRC and TLC. SCS will 
be applied at each of these lung volumes while measurements of airway pressure and peak expi[INVESTIGATOR_739557].  
Measurements will also be made with the subject making their own expi[INVESTIGATOR_739558]. The subject will be asked to exhale forcefully against an occluded airway in synchrony with muscle activation during which time airway pressure and peak expi[INVESTIGATOR_739559]. This is the prescribed pattern of use of the system at home by [CONTACT_739579].  
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_739523] #: IRB15 -[ZIP_CODE]  
Date Approved: 4/10/[ADDRESS_1010552] infections over a 2- year period will be collected prior to implantation of 
the study device. Following implantation, this will be tracked continually. Responses to questionnaires (life quality, caregiver burden  and secretion management index) will be compared prior to implantation and also at 
defined endpoints during the study. Mean changes of each parameter for the entire group will be determined.  
 Method of data analysis  
Graphs will be constructed relating changes in stimulus amplitude to airway pressure generation and expi[INVESTIGATOR_400459]. Each of the subjects will serve as their own control. Upon overall significance, appropriate pairwise comparisons will be performed. Since these contra sts are equivalent to multiple t- tests between levels, protection 
against type I error will be accomplished with a Bonferroni correction. A p value of < 0.[ADDRESS_1010553]. Tabbaa, staff physician in the Department of Anesthesiology and/or [CONTACT_739584], staff physician in the Department of Neurosciences, both at MetroHealth Medical Center. 
[CONTACT_739585] has performed parallel wire lead placement routinely for other indications of SCS for more than [ADDRESS_1010554] 2 hours. 
Any surgical procedure carries a risk of infection and bleeding. The incidence of infection and excessive blood loss related to this surgery are generally considered to be less than 1%. Although unlikely, there is also a chance that th e body will reject the implanted materials which will require their removal. It is possible to develop a pocket 
of fluid (seroma) around the receiver, and, if infected, the receiver will have to be removed. There is also a rare possibility that the stitche s holding the leads and receiver in place will break causing these to shift in position. 
Other potential risks include lead migration and leakage of cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872].  
3. Risks Associated with Spi[INVESTIGATOR_739560] a condition known as autonomic dysreflexia, a condition characterized by [CONTACT_739580], blotchy skin and sweating, high blood pressure and bradycardia. These symptoms can be triggered by [CONTACT_307888]. In our recent clinical trial, these symptoms occurred in ~ 20% of subjects and subsided quickly with discontinuation of stimulation. There is a remote possibility that bowel or bladder discharge 
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_739523] #: IRB15 -[ZIP_CODE]  
Date Approved: 4/10/[ADDRESS_1010555].  Due to improper 
use of the external t ransmitter (i.e. maintained in place continuously for days and weeks with tight fitting 
clothing), the receiver may erode through the skin exposing the subject to the risk of infection.  There is the remote 
possibility of electrically induced tissue damage . This is unlikely since the ranges of stimulus amplitude and pulse 
width are known to be safe. Moreover, the duration of stimulation is very brief. It is possible that placement of 
the device may worsen spasticity after implantation. This is rare and may ultimately require removal of the device.  
Temporary or transient sensory changes, such as electric like sensations, may be present during stimulation. These are uncommon and well tolerated, but can be lessened with changes in the stimulation parameters.  
 4. Device Malfunction  
The most common cause of device malfunction is decoupling of the external transmitter over the implanted receiver. Low battery power can also result in device malfunction. An error on the control box will display if there is low batter y power. The battery charge status can be checked at any time on the control box. The 
occurrence of fibrosis at the electrode- tissue interface could affect the long -term physiologic performance of the 
device. These damages were not encountered in our recen t clinical trial nor highly anticipated since the implanted 
materials are biologically inert.  
Improper activation of the implanted receiver could occur by [CONTACT_739581]’s transmitter. However, this is unlikely since the external t ransmitter must be placed close to the implanted receiver to power 
the device.  
 Precautions to minimize risks  
1. Pre -Surgical  
During standard blood draws, suitable precautions will be taken to minimize risks of bruising, infection or 
blockage of the vein.  
Because MRI could result in movement of iron- containing objects, precautions will be taken to minimize such 
events. Loose metal objects, like pocketknives or key chains, will not be allowed in the MRI room. Earplugs will be applied to prevent temporary hea ring loss.  
 2. Surgical  
While the incidence of infection and excessive blood loss related to this surgery are generally considered to be very low, every effort to minimize this risk will be taken before, during, and after the procedure, including administr ation of antibiotics.  
 3. Spi[INVESTIGATOR_739561], blood pressure and pulse will be monitored closely during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_121543] -patient visits and at home during the initial period of SCS. If significant blood pressure 
changes occur (systolic > 140 mmHg) during SCS or if the subject experiences symptoms of autonomic dysreflexia (AD), stimulation will be stopped until hemodynamic parameters stabilize. Based upon our previous experience, increasing t he interval between applied SCS minimizes hemodynamic changes and when signs of AD 
occur initially, they eventually resolve completely over the subsequent 3- [ADDRESS_1010556]’s skin will be inspected daily for redness and/or irritation and any abnormalities immediately reported to the study team. The subject and caregiver will be instructed to remove the external transmitter each night, inspect the skin and immediately report any abnormal findings to the study team. 
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_739523] #: IRB15 -[ZIP_CODE]  
Date Approved: 4/10/[ADDRESS_1010557] and caregiver will be provided specific instructions on proper application of the device. Methods to assure maintenance of adequate battery power will also be provided, including instruction on how to check the status of battery charge. The level of applied electrical stimulation will be maintained within specific parameters that are known to b e safe and not 
result in deleterious side effects.

 Potential benefits  
Based upon our recent clinical trial, lower thoracic spi[INVESTIGATOR_739562], as reflected by [CONTACT_739582][INVESTIGATOR_739563] a maximum cough effort in normal persons. More importantly, this tech nique is a highly effective method of secretion clearance as it significantly reduces the difficulty in raising 
secretions and the need for caregiver support, reduces the incidence of respi[INVESTIGATOR_739564]. Subjects also re ported that this method is far more portable and comfortable compared to previously 
used methods of secretion management.  
 It is our hypothesis that an effective cough can be achieved with SCS using wire leads, which can be placed by a much less invasive s urgical procedure. If successful, this technique will have greater appeal to persons with SCI 
and be associated with less risk and cost while achieving the same clinical benefits. Moreover, this technique has the potential to reduce the high morbidity and mortality associated with respi[INVESTIGATOR_739565].   
IX. Significance  
 
Many spi[INVESTIGATOR_739566], respi[INVESTIGATOR_6014], including 
bronchitis and pneumonia and significant discomfort due to the inability to clear respi[INVESTIGATOR_739567]. Since conventional methods to remove s ecretions are tedious, labor intensive and oftentimes largely 
ineffective, respi[INVESTIGATOR_739568] a major cause of morbidity and mortality in this patient population.  Lower thoracic SCS may provide a means of generating large airway positive pre ssures and expi[INVESTIGATOR_739569] a normal cough. Restoration of cough may help reduce the incidence of respi[INVESTIGATOR_739570].

NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY    
 
Provide a brief non-technical summary or synopsis of the study that can be understood by [CONTACT_666114], including non-scientists and non-affiliated members.   
The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether providing patients with specialized preoperative 
counseling about the risks associated with opi[INVESTIGATOR_666059] a reduction of opi[INVESTIGATOR_666060]. The study will be a randomized controlled trial 
that will be performed at two sites (UC Irvine Medical Center and Kaiser Permanente Orange County – 
Irvine Medical Center). Patients who agree to participate will be randomized to control (standard of care) arm or an intervention (specialized opi[INVESTIGATOR_666061], which will be performed prior to their surgery and at the 2 week postoperative clinic visit) arm. 
The randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_666115]. Assessment of the patients’ opi[INVESTIGATOR_666062]-mediated pi[INVESTIGATOR_666063]’ standardized 
postoperative clinic visits. Any additional opi[INVESTIGATOR_486572] 12 months of the surgery will be 
evaluated by [CONTACT_118742]’ UC Irvine elec tronic medical records as well as the [LOCATION_004]

database. Additionally, patient pain scores and patients’ current storage and disposal patterns of 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_666064].   
  
SECTION 1: PURPOSE AND BACKGROUND OF THE RESEARCH  
 
1. Provide the scientific or scholarly rationale for the research.  Describe the relevant background 
information and the specific gaps in current knowledge that this study intends to address.  
Morbidity and mortality from prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_188793] a rising epi[INVESTIGATOR_666065].[ADDRESS_899531] ten years.2–[ADDRESS_899532] 
sought to address the optimal postoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_666066], obstetrical, and general 
surgery.6–[ADDRESS_899533] of patient education on postoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556].  
2. Provide relevant preliminary data (animal and/or human).   
Hota et al. evaluated 57 women undergoing urogynecologic surgeries for pelvic organ prolapse and 
urinary incontinence and reported that the median number of opi[INVESTIGATOR_666067] 2 weeks after a minimally invasive urogynecologic surgery was less than 10. Sixty six percent of patients reported having excess opi[INVESTIGATOR_666068] 2 weeks postoperatively and 42% of patients reported that they were going to 
keep their excess tablets for future use.[ADDRESS_899534] of the 
amount prescribed.12 Bates et al. surveyed adult patients who underwent surgery in a urology practice 
and showed that only 58% of the prescribed pain  medication was used and 67% of participants 
reported having excess medication6. Of note, 92% of patients within the study reported receiving no 
formal disposal instructions for excess opi[INVESTIGATOR_666069], 
91% kept the medication at home.  Bartels et al. found that 53% of participants reported taking fewer 
than five opi[INVESTIGATOR_666070] a cesarean delivery.[ADDRESS_899535] of the preoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_2495] d educational intervention on postoperative patient 
storage patterns and compliance with FDA-recommended disposal patterns of opi[INVESTIGATOR_666071]: 06-04-2018 | MOD# [ZIP_CODE] | HS# 2017-[ADDRESS_899536] 
higher rates of safe storage patterns (out of sight, in a locked area) and FDA-recommended disposal 
patterns (return to a FDA-approved distribution center, mix with an unpalatable substance before 
disposing in the trash, or flushing down the sink or toilet) compared to patients who did not receive the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_666072].  
 
The pattern of postoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556] w ill be evaluated at [ADDRESS_899537] 12 months postoperatively compared to subjects who did not receive the educational 
intervention.  
 
The postoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_666073] 
(preoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], active tobacco use, the presence of a chronic pain syndrome, anxiety, depression) will be compared to subjects without these conditions. The hypothesis is that subjects with 
these clinical conditions will have higher postoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_666074], including higher rates 
of opi[INVESTIGATOR_666075] 12 months after surgery, compared to subjects without these conditions.  
 
The subjects’ opi[INVESTIGATOR_666076]. The hypothesis is that subjects who received the preoperative educational intervention will be 
more likely to answer that their opi[INVESTIGATOR_666077] “more than adequate” or “adequate” compared 
to subjects who did not receive the educational intervention. The subjects’ opi[INVESTIGATOR_666078] (chronic pain syndrom es, anxiety, depression, active tobacco use, and 
preoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441]) to subjects without these c onditions. The hypothesis is that subjects with the 
clinical conditions will be more likely to ans wer “less than adequate” regarding their postoperative 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_666079].   
4. Describe the primary outcome variable(s), secondary outcome variables, and predictors and/or 
comparison groups as appropriate for the stated study objectives/specific aims.     
Primary outcome variable: mean number of opi[INVESTIGATOR_666067] 2 weeks postoperatively 
 
Secondary outcome variables:  
1. Patient reported opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556] 6 weeks postoperatively 
2. Modified surgical pain score (validated questionnaire) at the preoperative assessment and 2 weeks and 6 weeks postoperatively  3. Responses to the Preoperative Opi[INVESTIGATOR_666080] (investigator authored) at the 
preoperative assessment  4. Responses to the Postoperative Opi[INVESTIGATOR_666081] (investigator authored) at 2 weeks 
UCI IRB Approved: 06-04-2018 | MOD# [ZIP_CODE] | HS# 2017-[ADDRESS_899538] system and [LOCATION_004] Department of Justice CURES 2.0 database at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 12 months postoperatively 6. Evaluate intraoperative complications (packed red blood cell transfusion, bowel injury, bladder injury, 
ureteral injury, conversion to laparotomy) – each variable will be measured independently  
7. Evaluate postoperative complications (mesh ex posure, wound infection, packed red blood cell 
transfusion, neuropathy, or urinary tract infection within [ADDRESS_899539] operativel y) – each variable will be measured independently  
8. Total daily morphine equivalents prescribed in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_590230] – to be calculated using 
the Opi[INVESTIGATOR_666082]   
9. Post-operative date upon discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]  10. Post-operative date that the patient passed a voiding trial and the transurethral catheter was removed  11. Duration of the surgery (in minutes)  
Comparison groups: subjects will be randomized to  an intervention arm versus control arm. The 
intervention arm will receive opi[INVESTIGATOR_666083]. The contro l arm will receive the current standard preoperative 
and postoperative instructions and counseling. The two arms will be stratified by [CONTACT_3885] (UC Irvine versus Kaiser Permanente Orange County – Irvine).  
 
Additional analysis will be conducted to compare the modified surgical pain scores and answers to questions on the postoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_666084] (chronic pain syndromes, anxiety, depre ssion, active tobacco use, and preoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_173942]) as compared to subjects without these conditions.

Inclusion criteria:  Female  
UCI IRB Approved: 06-04-2018 | MOD# [ZIP_CODE] | HS# 2017-4003
8 of 25
 
    Age 18-99 years old 
English speaking  
Evaluated by a provider within the Urogynecology  division at UC Irvine or Kaiser Permanente Orange 
County – Irvine Medical Center and consented for either a uterosacral ligament suspension, sacrospi[INVESTIGATOR_11592], minimally-invasive colpopexy (either laparoscopic or robotic-assisted 
laparoscopic), colporrhaphy, or colpocleisis  
 Exclusion criteria: 
Non English-speaking  
Cognitive deficits that would prevent the patient from completing the study questionnaires  
Cancellation of the surgery  
Combined case with another surgical service (i.e. colorectal surgery) 
 
2. If eligibility is based on age, gender, pregnancy/childbearing potential, social/ethnic group, or 
language spoken (e.g., English Speakers only), provide a scientific rationale.  
The division of urogynecology at UC Irvine exclusively treats female patients with the above stated 
procedures for the indication of pelvic organ prolapse. As such, male patients would not be eligible to 
participate since they are not candidates for the above noted procedures due to anatomical 
differences. The study patient educational pamphlets are only available in English and therefore the study objectives are best observed within an English proficient patient population.

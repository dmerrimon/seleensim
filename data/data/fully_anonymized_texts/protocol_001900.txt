 2.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
 
2.1. Introduction  
 
MV-NIS is an attenuated MV, engineered to express the huma n thyroidal 
sodium -iodide symporter  (Figure 1 ). The virus is selectively oncolytic, targeting 
and destroying tumor cells through CD46, a membrane regulator of complement 
activation that is known to be overexpressed on many human malignancies.1-[ADDRESS_731768] of MV -NIS 
increases exponentially as the density of CD46 on target cells increases and is 
therefore dramatic at high CD46 densities (tumor) but minimal at low densities 
(normal tissues). NIS expression in MV -NIS infected cells permits noninvasive 
monitoring of virus spread by [CONTACT_557313]/CT imaging of radioiodine uptake. In 
addition, the anti -neoplastic activity of the virus can be amplified by [CONTACT_17801] 
131I , a potently ionizing bet a emitting isotope of radioiodine.[ADDRESS_731769]. Stephen Russell, Mayo Clinic.  
 
 
The Mayo Clinic therefore conducted a phase I clinical trial to evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of MV -NIS administered intravenously in a single dose, alone 
or preceded by a single dose of Cy which has shown that  a) MV-NIS is safe at 
all dose levels tested ([ADDRESS_731770] been treated at the maximum feasible 
dose of 1011 tissue culture infectious dose 50 ( TCID 50), and b) a  single dose of 
Cy has no effect on the safety profile nor on the anti -MV antibody response.  
 
We now propose to conduct a phase II clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and 
safety of  single dose  MV-NIS administered intravenously to patients with 
advanced  MM in combinatio n with Cy, administered daily for four days.

 Other aims are: a) the determination of the lowest effective dose  by [CONTACT_102168], b) 
perform pharmacokinetic studies to determine the location of virus -infected cells, 
c) the time course of viral gene expressio n, and d) the evolution of the humoral 
and cellular immune response to MV and tumor antigens. Our overall hypothesis 
is that MV-NIS administered intravenously to patients with advanced MM on day 
[ADDRESS_731772]/CT imaging after MV -NIS 
therapy to monitor the changing number and location of virus -infected cells.  
 
2.2. MV-NIS: Description  
MV-NIS is a live tissue culture adapted MV engineered to express the human 
NIS gene . The virus propagates selectively in human cancer cells, leading 
directly to tumor cell killing. MV -NIS-infected tumor cells express NIS, a 
membrane i on channel that actively transports iodide and other monovalent 
anions such as sodium technetate (99mTcO 4)  into the cell. Radioiodine and 
99mTcO 4 uptake by [CONTACT_357699] a basis for in vivo  imaging 
studies to reveal the profile of MV -NIS g ene expression and the location of MV -
NIS-infected cells during virus spread and elimination. MV -NIS was constructed 
by [CONTACT_357700] a full -length infectious molecular clone of an 
attenuated  MV-Edm  and propagates on Vero cells with kinetics  equivalent to the 
parental strain.   
 
2.2.1.  MV-NIS: Mechanism of tumor targeting  
 
MV-NIS is selectively oncolytic, targeting and destroying tumor cells 
through CD46, a membrane regulator of complement activation that is 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_139701] -expressed on human malignan cies.1-3 CD46 is the major 
cellular receptor for MV -NIS, mediating virus attachment entry and 
subsequent cell killing through cell -cell fusion.  4 The CD46 tropi[INVESTIGATOR_557282]-Edm was acquired during tissue culture adaptation7 and 
distinguishes them from wild -type MVs, which enter cells primarily 
through two alternative receptors; SLAM, expressed on activated T cells, 
B cells and monocytes8  and NECTIN -[ADDRESS_731773] 
demonstrated that CD46 is expressed at higher levels on human tumors 
of many differe nt lineages than on their non -transformed counterparts.  1,3 
Thus, MV -NIS is a new class of antineoplastic agen t that targets a widely 
expressed tumor phenotype; namely, a high membrane expression of 
CD46.  
 
UARK [ADDRESS_731774] 21, 2015

 Gene expression profiling (GEP, Figure 2) and flow cytometry 
demonstrates that CD46 is highly expressed on myeloma cells. 
Furthermore, CD46 is encoded for on c hromosome 1q which is often 
amplified in advanced MM.9,10 supporting the notion that MV -NIS may be 
especially useful for the treatment of more aggressive, relapsed MM. 
 
 
The receptor for Measles Virus (CD46) is 
expressed on all subtypes of Myeloma
  
Figure 2.  The MV-NIS receptor CD46 is highly expressed on all molecular subtypes11 of 
MM.  Shown are CD46 expression levels measured by [CONTACT_557314]138 -positive  purified 
cells from healthy donors (NPC, normal plasma cells) and MM patients of the following 
molecular subgroups:  CD-1, CD-2, HY (hyperdiploidy, LB (low bone disease ), MY 
(myeloid , data  not available ), PR (proliferation ), MF (MAF/MAF -B).  MM cell lines  (MMCL ) 
were also analyzed.  Parentheses  indicate the number of subjects analyzed . 
 
 
2.2.2.  MV-NIS: Radioiodine and 99mTcO 4 uptake  
 
NIS is an intrinsic membrane protein of 643 amino acids that sp ans the 
plasma membrane 13 times with three potential sites for N -linked 
glycosylation. NIS is a symporter that imports two sodium ions with every 
iodide ion transported into the cell. NIS expression in thyroid follicular 
cells has been exploited for more than 50 years in clinical practice for 
thyroid imaging (with 123I or 99mTcO 4) or ablation (with 131I) and for 
systemic therapy of well -differentiated thyroid malignancies.  12,[ADDRESS_731775]/CT imaging of 123I or 99mTcO 4 uptake, and tumor ablation can be 
achieved by [CONTACT_557315] 131I as a source of ionizing radiation. The 
local by[CONTACT_557316] -length of the  particles emitted by 131I is 
approximately [ADDRESS_731776]/CT  imaging.  
 
2.3. MM: Need for Alternative Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_557283] a steady improvement in outcome in patients treated on our  
Total Therapy (TT) programs. We have recently reported that a plateau emerges 
after 10 years in patients enrolled on TT1 who remain in uninterrupted remission.  
21  By [CONTACT_557317], consolidation, and 
main tenance, the projected 10 y ear event free survival in TT3 is in excess of 
60%.[ADDRESS_731777] that ‘cure’ is now well within reach 
for a significant proportion of MM patients. By [CONTACT_557318]2 and TT3, [ADDRESS_731778] been identified (GEP70) allowing for 
the calculation of a r isk score that is highly correlated with outcome.10  Patients 
with so -called ‘low -risk MM’ do substantially better in TT3 compared with TT2 in 
terms of CR -duration and EFS. However, approximately 15% of newly diagnosed 
MM patients have a high -risk gene score associated with an unacceptably poor 
outcome. At disease relapse, the percentage of patients with a high -risk gene 
signature [CONTACT_557368] 75%.[ADDRESS_731779] dose, 
demonstrated that this score correlates significantly with outco me. 23  Importantly, 
the 80 -gene GEP model (GEP80) also distinguished outcomes when applied at 
baseline. In the context of the validated 70 -gene model (GEP7 0), the GEP80 
model identified 9% of patients with a grave prognosis among those with GEP70 -
defined low -risk disease.  Interestingly, many of these high -risk associated genes 
map to chromosome 1. We and others have shown that amplification of 
chromosome 1q  also confers a poor prognosis  (Figures 3, 4) .9,[ADDRESS_731780] shown that 
MDS features in MM resulting from inherent genomic instability in the myeloma  
clone(s) also prognosticate for an adverse outcome.  [ADDRESS_731781] 21, 2015

copy number of 1q increases at the time of relapse.  
Hanamura, I. et al. Blood 2006;108:[ADDRESS_731782] symptoms and t ransient immunosuppression.27 The case fatality 
rate in the [LOCATION_002] of America is 0.1 to 0.2 %, but is higher in 
underdeveloped countries where opportunistic infections secondary to  MV 
immunosuppression are a more significant problem. At the other end of the 
spectrum, live attenuated MV vaccines have been used extensively. In the [LOCATION_003] 
alone, more than [ADDRESS_731783] common 
vaccine antigens (e.g., MV, mumps, rubella, diphtheria and tetanus) are greatly 
reduced33,34 and immune responses following vaccination are considerably 
impaired .32,35.  At the Mayo Clinic stored serum samples from patients with 
heavily pretreated MM and age -matched controls were tested for anti -MV 
antibody titer and i t was found that sera obtained from MM patients often 
contained very low levels of anti -MV antibody, in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_357656].  
 
The MV-mumps -rubella (MMR II) vaccine ([COMPANY_006]) delivers [ADDRESS_731784] -transplant. Thirty -six MM patients (M:F – 23:13) who 
received their transplant and routine [ADDRESS_731785] -auto peripheral blood stem cell 
transplant (PBSCT)  vaccination with MMR II were retrospectively studied at the 
Mayo Clinic. MMR II re -vaccination was delivered an average of 799 days 
(range: 539 - 1209) days after PBSCT . Follow -up time after re -vaccination 
averaged 755 days (range: 56 - 2345). Thirty -three of the [ADDRESS_731786]. Overall, there was no significant change after re -
vaccination in the patients' absolute lymphocyte counts or immu noglobulin levels, 
nor was there significant change in the monoclonal protein levels. Importantly, no 
specific toxicities were documented following MMR administration. While [ADDRESS_731787] a small decrease in monoclonal protein level, averaging only 
0.42g/dL (range: 0.1 - 1.2) after re -vaccination, [ADDRESS_731788] that c onventional doses of MMR vaccine administered by [CONTACT_557319], but inadequate for expression of oncolytic activity in patients 
with MM.  
 
2.5. MM: Susceptibility to MV -NIS Oncolytic Virotherapy  
 
Neoplastic plasma cells from MM patients expre ss high er levels of CD46 
compared to normal marrow elements and unstimulated peripheral blood 
lymphocytes and MM cells  are fully susceptible to infection by [CONTACT_357705] -NIS. In a 
laboratory study, CD138 -positive  myeloma cells from 5 patient bone marrow  
(BM)  aspi[INVESTIGATOR_557284] -NIS, and radioiodine uptake was 
measured [ADDRESS_731789] of cell -
cell fusion, the infected cells were shown to efficiently concentrate radioiodine 
achieving intracellular concentrat ions 50  fold higher than that of the incubation 
medium. Similarly, MV expressing a fluorescent GFP marker protein could 
efficiently fuse and kill MM cells but not non -transformed cells  (Figure 5) .[ADDRESS_731790] 21, 2015  
Version 11 
Page 13 of 80 
  
 
Figure 5 .  CD138 -positive m yeloma cells overexpress CD46 and are efficiently targeted 
by [CONTACT_357705] -GFP. Myeloma cells take up MV -GFP (A) and demonstrate much higher levels of 
MV receptor expression  (B). CD138 -negative,normal cells do not take up MV -NIS. 
 
 
Intravenous MV -NIS is a potent oncolytic agent in MM xenograft models. MM 
cells (ARH77, RPMI8226, KAS 6/1, MM1 S) were implanted subcutaneously into 
the flanks of athymic or SCID mice and the mice were treated intravenously with 
MV-NIS or MV -Edm (identical sequence to MV -NIS but lacking the NIS gene). 
Intravenous administration of MV -Edm caused complete regression o f ARH77 
xenografts and significantly slowed the progression of RPMI8226 xenograft 
growth. Moreover, a single intravenous dose of MV -NIS led to complete 
regression of large (0.5 mm diameter) KAS 6/1 xenografts.36 
 
2.5.1.  Therapy models: Noninvasive imaging of MV -NIS 
 
Intratumoral spread of MV -NIS was non-invasively evaluated by [CONTACT_240703] -
came ra imaging in 3 MM xenograft models. SCID mice bearing 
subcutaneous ARH77, KAS 6/1 or MM1 MM xenografts were injected 
intravenously with a single dose of MV -Edm or MV -NIS (2 x 106 IU). 
Three, 9 and 17 days later, 123I (18.5 MBq) was administered and -
came ra imaging performed after 1 hour. All tumors treated with the 
control virus MV -Edm were negative by -photon imaging, whereas all 
MV-NIS treated tumors were able to concentrate radioiodine and could be 
visualized by -camera imaging. Analysis of the chang ing image intensity 
over the period of 17 days established that NIS expression peaks 
approximately 9 days after virus injection, presumably reflecting the 
maximum extent of the virus infection.  
 
2.6. Modulating the Anti -MV Immune Response by [CONTACT_557309] -clinical studies .37 
 
Oncolytic viruses can be neutralized in the bloodstream by [CONTACT_557320], resulting in faster virus 
inactivation and further reductions in efficacy with each successive dose. A single 
dose of Cy at 370 mg /m2 was not sufficient to control the primary antiviral 
immune responses in mice, squirrel monkeys and humans. We therefore tested 
clinical ly approved multidose C y regimens, which are known to kill proliferating 

UARK [ADDRESS_731791] 21, 2015  
Version 11 
Page 14 of 80 
 lymphocytes, to determine if more intensive C y therapy can more effectively 
suppress antiviral antibody responses during virotherapy. In virus -susceptible 
mice, primary antibody respo nses to intravenously ( IV) administered oncolytic 
MV or vesicular stomatitis virus were partially or completely suppressed, 
respective ly, by [CONTACT_68058] (1 mg × 8 days) or systemic (3 mg × 4 days) C y regimens 
initiated 1 day before virus. When MV - or vesicular stomatitis virus -immune mice 
were re -challenged with the respective viruses and concurrently treated with four 
daily systemic doses of C y, their anamnestic antibody responses were 
completely suppressed and antiviral antibody titers fell significantly below pre -
booster levels. We conclude that the C y regimen of four daily doses at 
370 mg /m2 should be evaluated clinically with IV virotherapy  to control the 
antiviral antibody response and facilitate effective repeat dosing.  
 
2.7. Pre-Clinical Data: MV -NIS Toxicity and Biodistribution Studies  
 
2.7.1.  Biodistribution in CD46 transgenic, interferon α/β receptor knockout 
(IFNRKO 
x CD46 Ge ) mice  
 
Normal mice are not susceptible to MV infection, including wt -MV, MV-
Edm strain , and MV -NIS. However, mice transgenic for human CD46 
express the MV receptor and are permissive to infection. To further 
enhance the potential adverse effects of MV -NIS, mice were created 
which were both transgenic for CD46 and had a knock -out of the IFNR. 
IFNs are usually produced upon viral infection and render cells non -
permissive to viral replication.  As part of preclinical studies to evaluate 
MV-NIS, sensitive quantitative RT -PCR  (qRT-PCR)  methodology was 
developed in order to characterize tissue distribution of the virus in non -
tumor bearing transgenic IFNRKO 
x CD46 Ge mice that express human 
CD46 with human -like tissue distribution. Groups of male and female 
mice (10 mice/gender/tr eatment group) were given IV doses of vehicle or 
MV-NIS, 105 
TCID 50, 107 
TCID 50 or 107 
TCID 50 + 125 mg/kg Cy.  MV-NIS 
tissue distribution was studied non -invasively by [CONTACT_357712] -SPECT /CT 
imaging 4, 21 and 90 days after a dose of 0.5 mCi 123I. MV-NIS 
expression  in tissues was measured 2, 5, 22 and 91 days after treatment 
(5 mice/gender/treatment group) by [CONTACT_4503] -PCR. Imaging 
studies showed that functional NIS was not detected in tissues other 
than those with normal expression after administration of MV -NIS. 
Highest concentrations of MV -NIS (> 10,000 MV -NIS RNA copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/ µg 
total RNA) appeared in lung, liver, spleen and blood of both male and 
female mice 2 days after administration of 107 
TCID 50 +/- Cy. Cy did not 
delay clearance of MV -NIS from tissues.  Blood concentrations 
remained high on day 5, and fell to undetectable levels in blood on day 91. 
Lung and liver concentrations fell to undetectable levels by [CONTACT_4475] 91. 
Spleen concentrations were substantially lower on day 5 and day 22, and 
detectable in only 5 of 24 mice given high dose MV -NIS +/ - Cy on day 91.  
277 – [ZIP_CODE] (median, 440) copi[INVESTIGATOR_557285] -NIS/ µg total RNA were detected

According to the protocol 144 IFNRKO 
x CD46 Ge mice (12/sex/dose 
group), approximately [ADDRESS_731795] articles (MV -NIS [NSC -731414] and Cy [NDC# 0015 -0547 -41]) or the 
control article (MV -NIS vehicle [5% sucrose, 50 mM Tris -HCl, pH 7.4, 
2mM MgC l2] diluted as per Test Article). Cy was at 125mg/kg given 2 
days prior (Day -2) to MV -NIS in order to modulate the immune response 
to MV -NIS. Cy and MV -NIS were given as a single intravenous bolus 
injection through the tail vein. On study days 2, 5, 22, a nd 91 six 
mice/dose group were euthanized and a complete necropsy examination 
was performed. Protocol -specified tissues were preserved in 10% neutral -
buffered formalin (NBF) and sent to P athology Associates International ’s 
Frederick, MD facility, which con ducted the remainder of the analysis on 
those samples.

Mayo Clinic Toxicology Core ran the in -life portion of the studies, 
including monitoring clinical signs and weights daily the first week post 
article administration and weekly thereafter. At time of necropsy, final 
weights were taken, and mice were bled from the retroorbital plexus. 
Blood parameters  analyzed included: hematology (white blood cell count, 
lymphocyte percent, monocyte percent, granulocyte percent, red blood 
cell count, mean corpuscular volume, hematocrit, mean corpuscular 
hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, red cell 
distribution width, hemoglobin, platelet count, mean platelet volume, and 
platelet distribution width); clinical chemistry (albumin, alkaline 
phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, amylase, total bilirubin, blood 
urea nitrogen, calcium, phosphorus, creatini ne, glucose, sodium, 
potassium, total protein, and globulin); and coagulation (prothrombin time 
and activated partial thromboplastin time). Plasma was also collected for 
anti-MV antibody titers. The in vivo  portion of the study started March 7th, 
[ADDRESS_731796] dose of virus 
(1x104 
TCID 50) in Group [ADDRESS_731797] 
single administration, indicating that greater than 1x104 
TCID 50 of MV -NIS 
is needed intravenously for the mice to mount an effective antibody 
response.  
 
In Groups 1, 3, 4, and 5, there were no toxicological  findings in the 
hematology or coagulation that were considered to be related to the 
administration of MV -NIS. In clinical chemistry, there were sporad ic mild 
elevations in ALT in 3 virus treated mice that were not correlated with any 
pathological changes in the liver. Total protein levels were mildly elevated 
in Groups 3, 4, and 5 as compared to control Group 1. This rise in total 
protein and/or globuli n in virus -treated groups was likely due to the 
production of anti -MV immunoglobulin. Groups 4 and 5 BUN levels were 
mildly decreased as compared to control Group 1, but were not 
accompanied by [CONTACT_357714]. These changes 
were cons idered related to the administration of MV -NIS, but not of 
significant toxicity.  
 
In Groups 2 and 6, there were no toxicological  findings in coagulation that 
were considered to be related to the administration of MV -NIS. In 
hematology, the total WBC in Gr oup 6 was depressed as compared to 
Group 2, suggesting that the additional challenge of MV -NIS to mice pre -
treated with Cy further suppressed the WBC. In clinical chemistry, there 
were sporadic mild elevations of creatinine considered to be related to the 
administration of MV -NIS, though the mice with elevated creatinine did 
not correspond to mice that showed changes in kidney pathology.  
 
Upon histological analysis of mouse tissues, there were no 
toxicologic findings in tissues considered to be related to the 
administration of MV -NIS. Mice receiving pre -treatment with Cy showed 
changes in the lymphoid organs (mandibular and mesenteric lymph 
nodes, thymus, and spleen), urinary bladder, BM, testes and ovaries that 
were considered to be related to the administ ration of Cy at the day 2 
sacrifice. The Cy-related changes showed evidence of recovery in later 
time points.

 2.7.4.  Safety study of intravenous MV -NIS in squirrel monkeys with and without 
Cy  
 
This study was performed by [CONTACT_557321] (IITRI) in Chicago, IL 
through the NCI RAID program (Rapid Access to Intervention 
Development). According to the protocol, 12 male squirrel monkeys 
(Saimiri sciureus , 3/group) were intravenously dosed once  with either MV -
NIS or control article (saline) on study day 1. Animals in Groups II and IV 
were intravenously dosed once with Cy on study day 2. Two monkeys per 
group were sacrificed on study day 29, and the remaining animals were 
sacrificed on study day 91. See table below.  
 
All monkeys were evaluated for mortality/morbidity twice daily throughout 
the treatment and observation periods. All monkeys were observed for 
abnormal clinical signs at least once daily. Body weights were recorded 
on days 1, 8, 5, [ADDRESS_731800] and 
on days 3, 10, 15, 29, and 91. Thyroid hormone levels (TSH and  T4 
levels) were evaluated on days 29 and 91. Cytokine levels (IL -1, IL-6, IL-
12 and TNF levels) were evaluated on days 1, 4, 8, [ADDRESS_731801] and on days 1, 4 8, 29 and 91, and blood samples 
were collected on days 1, 4, 8, 29, and 91. MV -NIS levels were 
determined from these samples by [CONTACT_357717], [COMPANY_002]ster, 
MN. Two monkeys/group  were sacrificed on day 29, and the remaining 
animals were sacrificed on day 91. Tissues were collected, examined and 
fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin at necropsy. Samples of all fixed 
tissues were embedded and put into blocks. Microscopic pathology was 
performed on all tissues. Statistical analysis of continuous data through 
day [ADDRESS_731802] -hoc 
comparisons made using Dunnett’s test with a minimum significance level 
of p≤ 0.05.  
 
There were no premature or un scheduled deaths during the study. 
No adverse clinical signs were observed during the study.  No 
meaningful effects on body weights or body weight gains were noted 
during the study. There were no treatment -related effects noted for any 
clinical pathology pa rameters evaluated (hematology and clinical 
chemistry). No changes were observed in cytokine levels during the study. 
Lesions observed at necropsy included enlarged, dark -pi[INVESTIGATOR_557286], small thymus and red focus on medial lobe of liver. All gross 
findings were interpreted as incidental and not treatment -related. No 
treatment -related histopathologic changes were observed.

The case fatality rate in the [LOCATION_002] of America is 0.1 to 0.2 %, but 
is higher in underdeveloped countries where opportunistic infections 
secondary to MV immunosuppression are a more significant problem. At 
the other end of the spectrum, live attenuated  MV vaccines have been 
used extensively. In the [LOCATION_003] alone, more than [ADDRESS_731806] to their effects in non -immune -
compromised subjects, neither wild -type nor attenuated MVs cause a MV-
like illness in patients previously exposed to the virus.40,45 Furth er studies 
in IFNRKO 
x CD46 Ge mice  and new w orld primates, both with and 
without co -administration of Cy revealed no toxicities. Based on these 
pre-clinical observation s a clinical trial was initiated at the Mayo Clinic 
with MV -NIS in MM. 
 
2.8. Experience with MV -NIS in M M Patients  
 
MV-NIS dose s, and preliminary efficacy of MV -NIS administered intravenously 
with and without Cy in patients with relapsed or refractory MM.  
An ongoing clinical trial  entitled  Systemic Administration of Edmonston Strain of 
MV, Genetically Engineered to Express NIS, with or without Cy, in Patients with 
Recurrent or Refractory MM opened to patient enrollment on January 15, [ADDRESS_731807] patient was registered 2/23/07. Overall, [ADDRESS_731808] been treated and the trial is currently at Stage 
3/dose level 2. Stage 1 of the trial, which included 4 dose levels of single agent 
MV-NIS has been completed . Three patie nts each were treated with 105, 106, 107 
and 108 TCID 50 MV-NIS.  For Stage 2, eight patients were treated  with low dose 
(10mg/kg) Cy prior to MV-NIS at TCID [ADDRESS_731809] so 
far been treated with 1010 TCID 50 MV-NIS (June 4, 2012) and three patients 
treated at the maximum feasible dose of 1011 TCID 50 (July, 2013). Among the first 
20 evaluable patients  (Stage 1 and Stage 2) , no myeloma responses were  seen, 
nor were  any dose limiti ng toxicities observed. A summary of adverse events 
(AEs) are shown in Appendix  IV. In the first cohort of [ADDRESS_731810]/CT imaging 
and correlation with disease distribution.  
Scans have been completed for 29 patients and tumor uptake was seen in 6, one 
in Stage  1, dose level 1 (Figure 6), one in Stage 2, dose level 1 ( Figure 7), two 
in Stage 2 dose level 2 (data not shown), two in Stage 3 dose level 2 (data not 
shown). Neither the baseline PET or SPECT had uptake, but a lytic bone lesion 
was visible on bone windows  of the CT. Factors predicting for positive 123I 
SPECT /CT scans included lower baseline WBC (3.2 versus 4.5, p=0.01) and 
viral dose ( p=0.05).

Characterization of the time course of expression, replication, biodistribution, and 
shedding of MV -NIS and correl ation of these parameters with CD46  expression 
in myeloma cells, dose level, & toxicity  
 
Viral clearance in first 6 hours:  A protocol modification went into effect in the 
3rd quarter of [ADDRESS_731817] 24 
hours after MV -NIS treatment. PK studies are available for 6 patients  treated at 
1010 (patients 10.1 to 10.3) and 1011 TCID 50 (patients 11.1 to 11.3) . These data 
are shown in Figure 8. At higher dose levels , more virus persists in  the 
circulation and this wa s observed beyond 4 hours . 
 
 
Figure 8. Quantitative RT -PCR showed that more virus persists in the circulation 
of patients receiving higher dose levels of MV -NIS.  
Specificity of MV -NIS for myeloma cells:  BM samples harvested p re-therapy 
were sorted into CD138 -positive  myeloma cells and CD138 -negative  non-
myeloma cells prior to infection with MV -GFP. Note the preferential infectivity of 
CD138  positive  (myeloma cells) as compared to CD138  negative cells (other BM 
cells) in Figure  9.

Time course of viral shedding:  To date, virus has been detected in sputu m, 
urine and blood of so me patients on days 3, 8 and 15,  but not in day 42 BM 
samples (data not shown). The time points one is most likely to detect shed virus 
are days 8 and 15 ( Figure 10). Viral persistence is rare at day 22 and beyond; 
the one exception was patient #7. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_557287] (sputum swab) was most 
common, even at low doses of virus. In contrast, urine shedding was not seen 
until dose of 108 TCID 50 & blood not until [ADDRESS_731819] viral genome shedding into the urine among those 
patients wi th a lower CD46 density on their CD138 -negative (non -myeloma BM) 
cells, 6,668 versus 8 ,367 CD46 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/cell, p=0.05. Although the ex vivo  
infectivity of cells with MV -GFP was associated with CD46 density on cells, there 
was no apparent relationship between  ex vivo  infectivity and in vivo  viral 
shedding.

Most patients had very low anti -MV antibody titers at  baseline which boosted 
significantly by [CONTACT_5875] 6, both by  [CONTACT_283371] (Diamedix assay, Figure 
11) and by  [CONTACT_557325]  (Figure 12).  Antibody titers also 
boosted in patients 13 to 20 receiving Cy.  Patient 27 had a major respon se to 
MV-NIS.

Relationships  between other baseline and 6 week immune parameters were 
studied (data not shown). At baseline patients had low lymphocytes (C D45 cells) ,  
helper T cells (CD4 cells), normal T cells (CD3), and B cells (CD19 ). At [ADDRESS_731821] increases in B cell s and T helper 
cells ( p<0.05). T -cell immunity to MV as measured by [CONTACT_20129] γ ELISA and ELISPOT 
was severely impaired and there was no difference between baseline 
measurements and [ADDRESS_731822] 
comprehensive phase I/pharmacokinetic oncolytic virus study yet 
conducted.  MV -NIS has been very w ell tolerated at the doses tested and 
positive radioiodine imaging studies in [ADDRESS_731823] also 
been significant limitations in the trial: 1) The very low dose of Cy tested 
in the clinical trial was insuf ficient to suppress the anti-MV antibody 
response or to impact the intratumoral spread of the virus, 2) the 
experience with the three patients treated at 1011 with the single 
responder being a patient with a low anti -MV antibody therapy 
emphasizes the need  for suppressing MV antibody responses.  Further, 
the Mayo Clinic group has shown that higher intensity, clinically - 
approved , Cy protocols can efficiently and safely suppress the anti -MV 
antibody response in MV-susceptible mice (see section 2.6). Lastly, 
patients with high titers of anti -MV antibody will be excluded since studies 

UARK [ADDRESS_731824] shown that these patients neutralize MV -NIS and 
abrogate the oncolytic phase, Approximately 50% of patien ts do not have 
anti-MV antibody.  
 
In light of these  observations  and developments the following refinements 
of the clinical trial are now being pursued : 
 
a) Dose escalation will be started at doses of [ADDRESS_731825] been well tolerated.   This will commence after the completion of a 
Rapid Dose Escalation Phase  to enroll 4 subjects starting at 108.  See 
Section s 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4. 
 
Due to manufacturing limitations, the original clinical studies (Stages 1 
and 2) previously used a maximum dose of 109 TCID 50 MV-NIS, only 
three times higher than the minimum effective mo use dose (Figure 13).  
Figure 13 shows that the minimum effective dose was 105 (equivalent 
human dose 3 x 108) but tumor regression was delayed at this dose 
level. Rapid tumor control required a dose of 106 or higher ( equivalent 
human dose >3 x 109). 
 
Even at this low clinical dose it was shown  that MV -NIS can traffic via the 
bloodstream to the tumor, infect the tumor cells, amplify selectively in the 
tumor and then be eliminated by [CONTACT_27639]. There was 
therefore a strong rationale to push the dose o f MV-NIS to higher levels 
and this is ongoing (Section 2.8).  
 
Recently developed i mprov ements to  Good Manufacturing Practice  
procedures  will allow  for the production and administration of higher titers 
of MV -NIS to MM patients .

 Figure 13. MV-NIS to treat KAS6/1 MM xenografts .  Preclinical studies using 
intravenous MV -NIS to treat KAS6/1 MM xenografts are shown. Five groups of 10 
irradiated SCID mice age six to eight weeks were implanted subcutaneously with 
107 KAS-6/1 tumor cells in 100 L of normal saline in the right flank. When tumors 
reached 0.5 cm in diameter, control mice received a single intravenous injection of 
200 L of UV inactivated MV -NIS. Test mice received a single intravenous injection 
of live MV -NIS at a dose of 104, 105, 106 or 107 TCID 50.  
 
 
b) Suppressing the anti -MV immune response by 4 days rather than one day 
of treatment with Cy to prevent immediate viral neutralization and hence 
intratumoral spread of the virus to enhance oncolytic effi cacy 
 
c)   Only patients who have an anti -MV IgG antibody titer of <0. 3 U/mL will be 
eligible for study . 
 
 
2.8.2.  Improving immune suppression to allow for longer MV -NIS exposure  
 
The small dose of Cy employed in the ongoing clinical trial at the Mayo 
Clinic, adm inistered [ADDRESS_731827] evaluated more 
intensive Cy regimens in MV-susceptible transgenic mice a nd shown that 
4 days of Cy can suppress the anti -MV response . 
 
2.8.3.  “High-dose ” and “low dose ” Cy regimens are potently suppressive to the 
primary anti -MV antibody response in MV -susceptible mice.  
 
IFNRKO x CD46 Ge mice aged 6 -8 weeks were immunized by 
[CONTACT_557327] -NIS administered once. Antibody titers 
were measured by [CONTACT_557328]. Various Cy dosing regimens were 
tested (5mg, 4mg, 3mg, 2.5 mg IP daily for four days) or 1.8 m g, 1.5 mg, 
1.3 mg by [CONTACT_557329]) with the conclusion that 3 mg 
Cy IP per day for four days is the maximum that our mice can tolerate. 
The low dose regimen of 1.3 mg per day by [CONTACT_557330]. All mic e were immunized with MV one day after 
initiation of Cy therapy and analysis of the anti -MV antibody titers was 
performed four weeks later (Table 3) show ing that  not only are these new 
regimens well tolerated, they are also potently suppressive to the prim ary 
anti-MV antibody response. Importantly, a nti-MV antibodies were 
undetectable at the higher Cy dose.

[ADDRESS_731828] whether these Cy 
regimens could suppress the anamnestic antib ody response. CD46 
transgenic, IFN RKO x CD46 Ge mice aged 6 -8 weeks were immunized 
by [CONTACT_557331] -NIS and antibody titers were 
measured four weeks at which time a booster dose of MV -NIS was 
administered with saline, low dose Cy or high dose Cy (7 to 8 animals per 
group). Both Cy regimens suppressed the anamnestic anti -MV antibody 
response, and the high dose regimen caused the titer to decay 
significantly from pre -booster levels (Figure 14).  
  
 
Figure [ADDRESS_731829].  
 
When the dose is expressed in mg/m2, the area under the plasma 
concentration -time curve for Cy has been demonstrated to be essentially 
the same in all species te sted, including mouse, hamster, dog, rat, 
monkey and man .46  The human equivalent of the “high dose” mouse 
protocol is t herefore 400 mg/m2 daily by [CONTACT_557332] 
170 mg/m2 daily by [CONTACT_557333]. These two 
protocols are similar to well established human Cy schedules tha t have 
been used in MM patients .47-[ADDRESS_731830] 21, 2015  
Version 11 
Page 28 of 80 
 The dose of Cy being administered prior to virus administration in Stage 2 
of our ongoing clinical protocol is 10 mg/kg , but at this dose there has 
been no impact on the anti -MV antibody response measured [ADDRESS_731831] four day 
intravenous (10 mg/kg or ~400 mg/m2 daily) human Cy protocol converts 
to a dose of 125 mg/kg daily, or approximately 3 mg daily per 25 gram 
mouse. Cy has been extensively used in MM treatment protocols, often in 
higher intensity than the protocol being tested here .47-49 
 
For example, the toxicity  of Cy 600 mg/m2 IV days 1 -4 (i.e. 50% higher 
intensity than the protocol tested above)  has been reported.48 BM 
suppression was the major to xicity encountered in this study. The median 
leukocyte nadir was 200/ L, and leukocyte nadirs of less than 500/ L 
were seen in 69% of patients. Treatment -induced leucopenia resolved in 
15-[ADDRESS_731832] patients, but 34% of patients with nadir leukocytes 
<1000/L developed serious infections. Platelets decreased to a nadir of 
31,000/L. Of the 37 patients with pretreatment platelet counts of greater 
than 60,000/ L, only 9 (24%) required plate let transfusion. This degree of 
myelosuppression is more than we would feel comfortable tolerating in 
our current study, and for that reason  the 400mg/m2 days -1-[ADDRESS_731833] C y regimen incorporated in the VDT -
PACE protocol used  routinely for MM therapy at UAMS . Cy is an agent 
which is not toxic to stem cells , and any myelosup pression will be 
transient.  
 
3.0 OBJECTIVES  
 
3.1. Primary Objectives  
 
3.1.1.  To determine the clinical efficacy of oncolytic virotherapy with the 
optimum biological dose of  the Edmonston vaccine strain measles virus 
(MV-Edm) engineered to express the thyroidal sodium iodide symporter 
(MV-NIS) when administered in one dose with 4 days of 
cyclophosphamide (Cy) in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple

Hypothesis :  A 4 day course of  Cy therapy will suppress the T and B cell arms of the 
anti-MV immune response  more effectivel y than a single dose , thereby [CONTACT_557334] -MV 
antibodies  thus prolonging the oncolytic phase of the virotherapy . The proposed dose of 
Cy of 400mg/m2 for [ADDRESS_731836] safely been administered to patients without 
experiencing dose limiting toxicity (DLT), MV -NIS has not yet been given in the setting of 
the propsed Cy dose.  Therefore, we will begin this study by [CONTACT_125908] a small number of 
patients in a Rapid Dose Escalation Phase , with the goal of establishing that the there 
are no toxicity concerns with the prop osed regimen.  This rapid escalation phase is  
outlined in Sections 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3.  These subjects will also receive 4 doses of Cy at 
400 mg/m2.  It is also import ant to note that viremia per se  is not a dose limiting toxicity 
(DLT), and that any DLTs observed will be assessed in the context of viral titer to aid in 
the determination of causality.  
 
Upon completion of the initial Rapid Dose Escalation Phase , the stud y will progress to a 
Slow Dose Escalation Phase  with MV -NIS dosing in a higher range .  Three patients per 
MV-NIS dose group  will each receive MV -NIS at dose levels of 1x1010, 3x1010, 6x1010, or 
9x1010, all with [ADDRESS_731837] :

5.0 TREATMENT PLAN  
 
5.1. Dose Escalation Schedule  
 
This study  is designed to confirm the clinical efficacy of MV -NIS in 
relapsed/refractory MM, with the primary endpoint being clinical response 
measured by [CONTACT_311327]. Dose escalation is planned, with the intent of 
determining the minimum effective dose, with a thera peutic efficacy defined as 
the achievement of CR in [ADDRESS_731845] s at a given dose level. Toxicity 
and pharmacokinetics (viral spread, expression and elimination) of MV -NIS will 
be evaluated at each level. Durability of the responses will be evalu ated and in 
conjunction with the DSMB during an interim analysis and a determination will be 
made whether to proceed to a higher dose or whether the therapeutic effective 
dose has been reached and subsequent subjects will be treated at this level.   
The stu dy will begin with the treatment of 4 subjects beginning at a MV -NIS dose 
of 108 TCID 50, which will proceed through a Rapid Dose Escalation Phase .  Upon 
the completion of these 4 subjects (without DLT), the study will commence with a 
Slow Dose Escalation P hase  starting at a  MV-NIS dose of 1x1010 TCID 50.

designated inpatient rooms.  
 
Patients who develop febrile or allergic responses to the MV -NIS infusion will be 
treated with acetaminophen (650 mg, PO), and diphenhydramine hydrochloride 
(50 mg IV or PO). For rigors, meperidine hydrochloride (50 mg IV) will be 
administered. Symptoms suggestive of anaphylaxis such as dyspnea, itching, 
dizziness or symptomatic hypotension will result in the abrupt cessation of the 
viral infusion and the start  of aggressive supportive therapy with fluids, 
diphenhydramine, methylpredniso lone (1mg/kg IV) and epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] (1mg

5.3. MV-NIS Dose Escalation Rules (applicable to all steps of the Rapid Dose Escalation 
Phase ) 
 
5.3.1.  Enrollment will proceed sequentially .  A 28 -day waiting  period (counted 
from Day -[ADDRESS_731853] in the previous  dose cohort) will be 
observed between each step of the Rapid Dose Escalation Phase  to 
observe for toxicity.  
 
5.3.2.  The first  subject will be enrolled and dosed with MV -NIS 1x108 TCID 50 
with 4 doses of Cy at 400 mg/m2 (Step A) . 
  
5.3.3.  If no DLT is seen at this dose,  the next subject will be enrolled and dosed 
with MV -NIS 3x108 TCID 50 with 4 doses of Cy at 400 mg/m2 (Step B) . 
 
5.3.4.  If no DLT is seen at this dose, the next subject will be enrolled and dosed 
with MV -NIS 1x109 TCID 50 with 4 doses of Cy at 400mg/m2 (Step C) . 
  
5.3.5.  If no DLT is seen, the next subject will be enrolled and dosed with MV -
NIS 3x109 TCID 50 with 4 doses of Cy at 400mg/m2 (Step D) . 
  
5.3.6.  If at any step a DLT is observed, two additional subjects will be enrolled 
at the same step. 
  
5.3.7.  If two DLTs are observed at a ny step, the dose will be de -escalated to the 
previous step and will enroll an additional [ADDRESS_731854] been completed in the Rapid Dose Escalation Phase  
schedule, we will proceed with the Slow Dose Escalation Phase  with 
higher dose MV -NIS. 
 
5.4. MV-NIS Dose Escalation Rules (applicable to all steps  of the Slow Dose Escalation 
Phase ) 
 
5.4.1.  Subjects within a dose cohort will be enrolled sequentially at a maximum 
rate of one per [ADDRESS_731855] will receive therapy at 
the new dose level until the completion of a 28 -day waiting period 
(counted from Day -[ADDRESS_731856] in the previous dose cohort) to 
observe for toxicity.  
 
5.4.3.  If DLT is seen in [ADDRESS_731857] dose level then the dose will be de -
escalated by [CONTACT_557338]  1 x 109. (vide infra)   
 
5.4.8.  MTD will be defined as the highest dose at which no more than one out of 
six participants experiences DLT OR no DLT observed out of 3 patients at 
the maximum dose level, provided no DL T is observed at any of the 
previous dose levels (see section s 5.1, 5.7). In the case that no DLTs are 
observed in any of the dose levels, then the MTD will be the ma ximum 
dose delivered.  
 
5.4.9.  If [ADDRESS_731858] dose step , and 
no DLT is observed, then  escalation beyond this dose level will be 
considered. Further dose -escalation will only be considered in this 
scenario if no clinica l efficacy has been observed.  If 9 x 1010 dose level 
(for step 4) is reached without dose limiting toxicity  then the study will be 
re-evaluated  with the DSMB in terms of further escalating the MV -NIS 
dose. Further, increases will need FDA and IRB approval  before 
implementation  
 
5.4.10.  An interim analysis of efficacy will be performed after enrollment of 6 
patients and a determination of whether or not to continue dose 
escalation will be made.  
 
5.4.11.  Toxicity Observation Period: The first 4 weeks after therapy will be 
considered the toxicity observation period, where any DLTs observed in 
this timeframe will determine whether or not accrual can continue to the 
next dose level.  
 
5.4.12.  About 45 subjects  will be screened for study eligibility based on levels of 
anti-MV antibody.  Patients with anti -MV IgG levels >0. 3U/mL are 
ineligible (see sections 4.1 and 4.2).  Patients whose anti -MV antibody 
levels exceed this threshold during screening will be replaced on study.    
 
UARK [ADDRESS_731859] 21, 2015  
Version 11 
Page 36 of 80 
 5.4.13.  If a patient fails to complete the initial course of therapy (i.e. registers, but 
does not receive therapy or  is lost to follow -up during the first 6 weeks), 
the patient will be regarded as not evaluable and an additional patient will  
be treated at the current dose level.  For these instances, a specific 
notation will be made for review by [CONTACT_557339] a dose level for reasons other than toxicity  or 
ineligibility due to anti -MV IgG levels , the reasons will be reported to the 
FDA and the trial may be voluntarily halted pending comments by [CONTACT_357732].  
 
5.5. Dose De-Escalation  
 
5.5.1.  If two patients experience DLT at a dose level in the Rapid Dose 
Escalation Phase  of the study, an additional 3 pati ents will be accrued at 
the previous dose level.  
 
5.5.2.  If two or more patients experience DLT at the starting dose level  (slow 
escalation phase) , then the new dose level 1 will be 1 x 109.  Re -
escalation will occur according to escalation rules described in 5.4 except 
with thi s log -lower base.  
 
5.5.3.  If two or more patients experience DLT at dose level s 2-4, an additional 
three patients will be accrued at the previous dose level.  
 
5.6. Anticipated Toxicity  
 
5.6.1.  Acute febrile reactio n to the intravenously administered virus may occur. 
Ancillary support is described in sections 8 and 11.  
 
5.6.2.  MV-like illness (coryza, malaise, fever, rash, lymphadenopathy and 
transient suppression of the immune system). Patients will be educated 
about the symptoms of MV and asked to report immediately if any of 
these symptoms develop. The disease is self -limiting in normal adults but 
MM patients are immunocompromised, treatment will be implemented if 
the symptoms (including temperature > 38.5°C) persist for as long as 6 
days, and earlier at the treating physician’s discretion. Earlier treatment is 
strongly recommended if a typi[INVESTIGATOR_557289]. Treatment will 
include Immun e Globulin (GamaSTAN,  15 m L maximum) and Ribavirin 
(10 mg/kg/day in 4 divided doses orally or 20  mg/kg/day 
intravenously).50,51 Administration of these medications will be tracked and 
a participant with persistent MV-like illness will be classified as having 
experienced a DLT (see Section 5.7).  Additional ancillary support is 
described in section 9.

5.6.3.  For other individuals, possible side effects may include nausea, vomiting, 
stomach ache and diarrhea, met allic taste in the mouth, fever, headache, 
or acne. Other rare, but serious side -effects include: burning mouth/throat, 
sore teeth/gums, mouth swelling, increased saliva, eye irritation/swollen 
eyelids, severe headache, goiter, signs of decreased thyroid g land 
function, confusion, numbness/tingling/pain/weakness of hands or feet, 
gastrointestinal hemorrhage.  
 
5.6.4.  The planned Cy therapy may be associated with nausea, vomiting, 
diarrhea, fatigue, a drop in white blood count, hemoglobin and platelets. 
Since Cy wil l allow the MV to replicate longer at lower MV -NIS dose 
levels, we anticipate that this may lead to more severe symptoms of a 
MV-like illness.

 8.0 ANCILLARY THERAPY  
 
8.1. Supportive Care  
 
Patients may receive full supportive care during the study (pre-screening though 
study exit) including blood products, antibiotics , growth factors,  and/or treatment 
of concurrent medical conditions and other newly diagnosed diseases  at the 
discretion of the treating physician .  
 
8.2. Monitoring  
 
Patients will be closely monitored during infusion of the virus for acute febrile 
reaction to the intravenously administered virus. Patients who develop febrile or 
allergic responses to the infusion will be treated with acetaminophen (650 mg, 
po) and diphenhydramine hydrochloride (50mg IV or PO). For rigors, meperidine 
hydrochloride (50 mg IV) will be administered. Symptoms suggestive of 
anaphylaxis such as dyspnea, itching, dizziness or symptomatic hypotension will 
result in the abrupt cessation of the viral infusion and the start  of aggressive 
supportive therapy with fluids, diphenhydramine, methylprednisone (1mg/kg IV) 
and epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] (1mg subcutaneously). Administration of these medications will 
be tracked.  
 
8.3. Patient Education  
 
Patients will be educated about the symptoms of MV (coryza, malaise, fever, 
rash, lymphadenopathy and transient suppression of the immune system28,29 ) 
and asked to report immediately if any of these symptoms develop.  
 
The incubation period of MV (rubeola) averages 10 to 12 days from exposure to 
prodrome a nd 14 days from exposure to rash (range, 7 to 18 days). Prodromal 
symptoms of severe, brassy cough; coryza; conjunctivitis; photophobia; and fever 
appear 3 to 4 days before the exanthem and increase daily in severity. The nose 
and eyes run continuously. Ko plik's spots (blue -white spots with a red halo) 
appear on the buccal mucous membrane opposite the premolar teeth [ADDRESS_731873] 
characteristic of MV that eruptions of similar appearance in other diseases are 
termed morbilliform. The early ra sh blanches on pressure; the fading rash is 
yellowish -brown with a fine scale, and it does not blanch.  
 
The disease is self -limiting in normal adults but MM patients are 
immunocompromised, treatment will be implemented if the symptoms (including 
temperatu re > 38.5 °C) persist for as long as 6 days, and earlier at the treating 
physician’s discretion. Earlier treatment is strongly recommended if a typi[INVESTIGATOR_557291] [ADDRESS_731874] 21, 2015  
Version 11 
Page 42 of 80 
 exanthem appears. Treatment will include Immune Globulin (GamaSTAN, 15 m L 
maximum) and Ribavirin (10 m g/kg/day in 4 divided doses orally or 20mg/kg/day 
intravenously) .50,51 Administration of these medications will be tracked and a 
participant with persistent MV-like illness will be classified as having experienced 
a DLT (see section  5.7) 
 
8.4. Disease Communication  
 
The disease is spread by [CONTACT_15206][INVESTIGATOR_557292] c ommunicated from 
slightly before the beginning of the prodromal period to 4 days after appearance 
of the rash; communicability is minimal after the second day of the rash. Though 
we would not expect the virus to be contagious to others since the majority o f the 
U.S. population is vaccinated, it will be required that health care personnel wear 
a mask at the first sign of cough; coryza; conjunctivitis; photophobia; or fever in 
the patient.  
 
The vaccine strain of the MV (of which MV -NIS is a derivative) has b een shown 
to be shed in the urine of normal children undergoing routine vaccination. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_557293], transmission has not 
been documented. However, since other patients may be severely 
immunosuppressed, i t will be required that MV -NIS-treated patients wear a mask 
while they are shedding virus (tested by [CONTACT_16641]-PCR).  
 
As a safety precaution, we will also recommend that all caregivers and close 
personal contacts be previously immunized against the measles virus .  
Caregivers should contact [CONTACT_557343].   
 
8.5. Concurrent Enrollment  
 
Patients enrolled in this study will not be eligible for concurrent enrollment in any 
other study involving a pharmacological  agent (drugs, biologicals, 
immunotherapy, gene therapy) whether for therapeutic intent or symptom control.  
 
9.0 AE REPORTING AND MONIT ORING  
 
This study will utilize the Common Terminology Criteria for A Es (CTCAE) v 4.0 for AE 
monitoring and reporting. The CTC AE v4.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP home 
page (http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/About.html ). All appropriate treatment areas 
should have access to a copy of the CTCAE v 4.0. 
 
9.1. AE Information  
 
AE monitoring and reporting is a routine part of every clinical trial. First, identify 
and grade the severity of the event using the CTCAE. Next, determine whether 
the event is expected or unexpected (refer to consent and/or product literature) 
and if the  AE is related to the medical treatment or procedure. With this 
information, determine whether an AE should be reported as an expedited repor t, 
or as part of the routinely reported clinical data to FDA , and/ or IRB at continuing 
review.  
UARK [ADDRESS_731875] (IRB) , per IRB policy 10.2  
 
9.2. Assessment of Attribution  
 
When assessing whether an AE is related to a medical treatment or procedure, 
the following attribution categories are utilized:  
 
Definite - The AE is clearly re lated to the investigational agent(s).  
Probable - The AE is likely related to the investigational agent(s).  
Possible - The AE may be related to the investigational agent(s).  
Unlikely - The AE is doubtfully related to the investigational agent(s).  
Unrelated  - The AE is clearly NOT related to the investigational agent(s)  
 
9.3. Expected vs. Unexpected  
 
 The determination of whether an AE is expected is based on agent -
specific AE information provided in the consent and/or protocol (Appendix 
II)  and/or drug handouts  
 Unexpected AEs are those not listed in the agent -specific AE information , 
and will be reported to the FDA following the guidelines outlined in 21 
CFR 312.32.  
 
9.4. AE Grading  
 
AEs shall be graded at each evaluation and pretreatment.  Symptoms/conditions 
are to  be evaluated at baseline per CTCAE v4.0 grading unless otherwise stated 
in the table below:

Submit via appropriate Ca se Report Forms (i.e., paper or electronic as 
applicable) the  following AEs experienced while on therapy : 
 
 Grade 2 AEs deemed possibly, probably or definitely related to the study 
treatment or procedure.  
 
 Grade 3 and 4 AEs regardless of attribution to the  study treatment or procedure.  
 
 Grade 5 AEs (Death)  
 
o Any death within 30 days of the patient’s last study treatment or 
procedure regardless of attribution to the study treatment or procedure.  
 
o Any death more than 30 days after the patient’s last study tre atment or 
procedure that is felt to be at least possibly treatment related must also 
be submitted as a grade 5 AE, with a CTCAE type and attribution 
assigned.  
  
10.0 TREATMENT/FOLLOW -UP DECISION AT EVALUATION   
 
10.1.  Discontinuation of Therapy  
 
The investigator may discontinue individual subject s from the study at any time 
for the following reasons: a) if the patient develops AEs that in the judgment of 
the investigator  preclude continuaton on study ; b) if a patient develops an 
intercurrent illness that is not consis tent with the protocol requirements ; c) if the 
patient is not compliant with the study plan ; d) if a female subject  becomes 
pregnant during the course of the study.  
 
10.2.  Subject Replacement  
 
Indications for replacing a patient include: a) subject screening: i f a patient is 
deemed ineligible due to anti -MV IgG titers (see section 4.1), an additional 
patient will be treated at the current dose level  and, b) If a patient fails to 
complete the initial course of therapy (defi ned as study  drug administration and 4 
weeks observation) for reasons other than toxicity (e.g. intercurrent illness, 
patient refusal, or patient non -compliance), the patient will be regarded as 
inevaluable and an additional patient will be treated at the current dose level (see 
section 5.4). If more than one participant must be replaced at a dose level for 
reasons other than anti-MV antibody levels or toxicity, the reasons will be 
reported to the FDA and the tri al may be voluntarily halted pending comments by 
[CONTACT_557344].  
 
10.3.  Response Monitoring  
 
UARK [ADDRESS_731877] 21, 2015  
Version 11 
Page 45 of 80 
 For the purposes of this study, patients will be evaluated for clinical response  
(See Appendix II ) at Week 6 and 3 mo nths and every 3 months thereafter while 
on observation. (See  Schedule of Evaluations Section 6.0). 
 
10.4.  Observation : Study Non-Completion  
 
Patients who have disease progression, refuse further observation, or go o n to 
receive alternate therapy will be monitored in Observation and will follow the test 
schedule per section 6.0 until 1 year after completing therapy. The exception to 
the rule is the case of a patient who pr ogresses before the Week 6  evaluation 
AND receives alternate therapy to treat MM: these patients will remain on active 
monitoring through Week [ADDRESS_731878] schedule per section 6.0 until 1 
year after completing therapy.  
 
10.6.  Cancelations  
 
If a patient is registered to thi s trial and refuses further participation prior to 
receiving treatment (and is classified as a cancel), it is not necessary to provide 
follow -up information. No further follow -up information is necessary.  
 
11.0 ANCILLARY STUDIES  
 
11.1.  Assessment of Viremia  
 
Assess ment of viremia and viral shedding will be performed on blood, saliva and 
urine per the schedule of evaluations (section 6.0) via qRT -PCR to determine 
virus RNA copy number and/or viral replication via co -cultu re on Vero cells for 
virus isolation. Testing will be performed in Dr. S.J. Russell’s laboratory at the 
Mayo Clinic. 
 
11.2.  Assessment of Immune Competence  
 
Assessment of immune competence  will be performed by [CONTACT_557345] . 
 
11.3.  Assessment of Peripheral Immune Response  
 
Assessment of the peripheral immune response to viral administration  will be 
evaluated per the schedule of evaluations  by [CONTACT_46890] -MV specific 
antibodies (IgG) . Other research assays to investigate immune -mediated anti—
MV and anti-tumor response may be assessed via IFN  secretion assays as well  
in the ITL research laboratory at UAMS .

 12.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS AND METHODOLO GY  
 
12.1.  Overview  
 
This is a Phase II study designed to confirm the clinical efficacy of MV -NIS in 
relaps ed/refractory MM. The primary endpoint is clinical response measured by 
[CONTACT_311327]. It should be emphasized that although dose escalation is planned, 
escalation of doses will be halted if therapeutic efficacy is observed in terms of 
achieving CR in 3 of  3 treated patients at a given dose level. Toxicity and 
pharmacokinetics (viral spread, expression and elimination) of MV -NIS will be 
evaluated at each level. Durability of the responses will be evaluated and in 
conjunction with the DSMB a determination wi ll be made whether to proceed to a 
higher dose or whether the therapeutic effective dose has been reached and 
subsequent subject s will be treated at this level . 
 
12.2.  Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD)  
 
The MTD will be defined as the highest safely -tolerated dose lev el where at most 
one patient out of six experiences DLT or no DLT observed out of 3 patients at 
the maximum dose level, provided no DLT is observed at any of the previous 
dose levels (see section 5.7). In the case  that no DLTs are observed in any of the 
dose levels, then the MTD will be the maximum dose delivered for each stage.  
 
12.3.  MTD determination  
 
Sample Size, Accrual and Study Duration: The first dose level of this study in the 
Slow Dose Escalation Phase will acc rue 3 patients.  If < 3 of 3 treated subjects 
achieve CR, then the study will proceed at the next dose level.  Each subsequent 
dose level will accrue an additional 3 patients , unless the primary endpoint of 3 of 
3 subjects achieving CR is met.  If this occ urs, then additional subjects will be 
accrued at this dose level  for a total enrollment of 16 subjects for this study  
(including the 4 subjects treated in the Rapid Dose Escalation Phase) .  Upon 
completion of the first (1x1010) dose level cohort, an interi m analysis assessing 
efficacy will be performed.  Escalation to the  and second (3x1010), third (6x1010) 
and fourth (9x1010) dose level cohorts will occur if it is determined that the 
primary  efficacy  endpoint has not been achieved at the lower dose level s.   
  
We do anticipate that approximately 10% of patients may not complete the DLT 
evaluation phase due to disease progression, patient refusal etc.  These patients 
may be replaced as outlined previously.  
 
12.4.  General Statistical Considerations:  
 
The trial i s designed to provide data about pharmacokinetics (biodistribution, 
targeting, viral gene expression and viral elimination), safety and biological 
activity and efficacy of MV -NIS in patients with MM. Data related to toxicity and 
pharmacology will be presen ted using descriptive statistics due to the exploratory 
nature of the study. The data will be presented in table formats listing the mean, 
standard deviation and number of patients per group for continuous data, or 
listing count and percentages for categor ical data as appropriate. All the relevant 
UARK [ADDRESS_731880] 21, 2015  
Version 11 
Page 47 of 80 
 data will be used both in exploratory and hypothesis generating fashions to 
examine factors related to toxicity and pharmacology . 
 
12.5.  Analysis Plans  
 
12.5.1.  Primary endpoints  
 
The clinical efficacy is response by [CONTACT_557346] d escribed above.   
 
A clinical response in this setting will be defined as noted in Appendix II . 
The number of responses ( of all types ) will be summarized by [CONTACT_557347].  Dose escalation will be halted if [ADDRESS_731881] treated 
in the Rapid Dose Escalation Phase of this study achieves CR, the 
determination will be made whether to accrue additional subjects at that 
dose level (rather than proceeding with escalation to the Slow Dose 
Escalation Phase).  In all cases, r esponse called at Week [ADDRESS_731882] toxicity grading. Non -hematologic toxicity 
measures will be assessed using continuous variables as the outcom e 
measures (nadir and percent change from baseline values) as well as 
categorization via CTCAE  v.4.[ADDRESS_731883] toxicity grading. Frequency 
distributions and other descriptive measures will form the basis of the 
analysis of these variables.  Further, tolerabi lity of this regimen will be 
explored in an ancillary manner through time -related variables including 
time until any treatment related toxicity, time until treatment related grade 
3+ toxicity.  
 
Lastly, any enhancement of suppression of the anti -MV respons e in 
patients will be done by [CONTACT_557348] -MV titers with previously treated 
patients without Cy at 1x1010 and 1x1011 dose levels. Simple comparative 
statistitics will be used . 
UARK [ADDRESS_731884] 21, 2015  
Version 11 
Page 48 of 80 
 12.5.2.  Secondary endpoints  
 
Data will be collected for a number of laboratory corr elative variables as 
discussed before including: a) virus replication, viremia, viral shedding in 
urine and respi[INVESTIGATOR_171919], and virus persistence, b) suppression of  
humoral and cellular immune responses to the injected virus, and c) the 
time cours e of viral gene expression and virus elimination, and the 
biodistribution of virally infected cells using  99mTcO [ADDRESS_731885]/CT  imaging.  
 
Descriptive statistics and scatterplots will form the basis of presentation of 
these variables. Correlations between the laboratory values and other 
outcome measures will be carried out by [CONTACT_357740] -
parametric tests (e.g. Pearson’s and Spearman’s rho). Data obtained 
from SPECT/CT  imaging of MV -NIS following 99mTcO 4 administration  will 
be used to determine t he biodistribution and kinetics of virus spread and 
NIS gene expression in vivo  and correlate it with tumor distribution. 
Where patterns of correlation are indicated, ordinary and partial 
correlation coefficients (controlling for dose levels) will be calcu lated. 
Inferential testing for significant shifts in the correlative laboratory data 
results across dose levels will be carried out only as a hypothesis 
generating exercise.  
 
At the end of the trial, the optimal dose level will be selected for future 
studi es based on clinical efficacy, toxicity profile, antibody response, NIS 
imaging signal .  
 
12.5.3.  Monitoring  
 
Members of the study team will review the study regularly to review the 
progress of this protocol and be kept aware of efficacy and toxicity issues. 
Indic ations for temporary stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_357683]: a) unexpected 
toxicity of any of the drugs; b) unexpected difficulties with production of 
MV-NIS; and c) unexpected difficulties with any of the assays required to 
monitor patient safety ( qRT-PCR monitoring) . 
 
12.5.4.   Early Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_557295].  The trial will be halted if serious treatment related toxicity or 
death occurs in [ADDRESS_731886] 3 patients. If one serious treatment related 
toxicity or death occurs then a further 3 patients will be enrolled. The trial 
will be halted if >[ADDRESS_731887] 6 patients. An interim analysis will be performed after 6 patients 
and discussed with the DSMB.   If ≤[ADDRESS_731888] 6 patients th en a further 3 patients will be enrolled. 
The trial will be halted if >[ADDRESS_731889] 9 patients. If ≤[ADDRESS_731890] 9 patients th en a further 3 patients will be enrolled. 
The trial will be halted if >[ADDRESS_731891] 12 patients.  If ≤[ADDRESS_731892] 12 patients th en a further 3 patients will be 
enrolled. The trial will be halted if > [ADDRESS_731893] 1 6 patients.  
 
13.0 SUBSET ANALYSES FOR WOMEN AND MINORITIES : 
 
13.1.  Eligibility  
 
This study will be available to all eligible patients, regardless of race, ethnic origin, 
and gender. There is no information currently available regarding differential 
effects of this regimen in subsets defined by [CONTACT_557349], and there is no 
reason to expect such differences to exist. Therefore, although the planned 
analyses will, as always, look for differences in treatment effect based on gender 
and racial groupi[INVESTIGATOR_14839], the sample size is not increased to provide additional 
power for subset analyses.  
 
13.2.  Enrollment of Female Subjects  
 
Since women typi[INVESTIGATOR_344777] 33% of this patient population, the number of 
women enrolled in this trial is expected to be approximately 5. 
 
13.3.  Study Population Statistics  
 
Both men and women will be included in this study, in  a 2:1 ratio, as this is a 
feature of the incidence of MM.  The study population will include non -Hispanic or 
Latinos of both White and African American races, at a ratio reflecting the patient 
population at our institution.

 APPEN DIX I : GUIDELINES FOR MV -NIS ADMINISTRATION  
BY [CONTACT_557354]-NIS is a live, tissue culture -adapted MV engineered to express the human thyroidal sodium 
iodide symporter (NIS). The virus was constructed by [CONTACT_357746] (cDNA) i nto a full -
length infectious molecular clone of an attenuated MV-Edm. This virus is not a vaccine. MV -NIS 
propagates on Vero cells with kinetics equivalent to the parental strain of virus. It propagates 
selectively in human cancer cells that it infects by [CONTACT_357747]46, a membrane 
protein that is overexpressed in tumor cell lines including MM. The virus is directly cytopathic to 
tumor cells leading to the formation of multinucleated syncytia that die by [CONTACT_20983]. MV -NIS 
infected tumor cell s express NIS, a membrane ion channel that actively transports iodide into 
cells. Radioiodine uptake by [CONTACT_557355]  (or 
99mTcO 4)  imaging that can reveal the profile of MV -NIS gene expression and the loca tion of MV -
NIS infected cells during virus spread and elimination.  
 
Preparation and storage:  
 
MV-NIS will be prepared at the Virus and Vector Production Laboratory (VVPL) of the Molecular 
Medicine Program at Mayo Clinic and stored at ≤ -65C. The virus w ill be shipped to UAMS, 
thawed , and mixed with normal saline prior to administration according to good practice 
guidelines for any Biohazard Level 1 biological. A leak proof box, preferably equipped with a 
gasket seal lid, should be used for transport of M V-NIS from one location to another . 
 The MV -NIS product will be dispensed with intravenous tubing attached that is primed 
with the base solution used for preparation of the medication. The product will be 
dispensed in leak -proof packaging and contain a labe l indicating safe handling 
precautions are required.  
 The drug, dose, dilution, drug diluent, final product concentration, labeling and 
documentation of the preparation are checked by a pharmacist prior to dispensing.  
Administration:  
 
The MV -NIS product will be administered by [CONTACT_25726] (30 minutes) in 100m L of normal 
saline under close observation in the  Inpatient Unit.   
 Personal protective equipment (PPE), including gloves, gowns, mask, and eye 
protection should be worn when handling the MV -NIS p roduct. Protective eyewear must 
be worn at all times that the product is handle d, and, in the event that splashing or 
spraying is anticipated, a mask or protective shield must be used. Protective eyewear 
should cover the eyes and areas above and below the eyes, and protection to the sides 
of both eyes. Face shields that extend from over the eye area to below the chin may be 
used.  
 Prior to administration of MV -NIS, two persons qualified to administer chemotherapy 
shall verify the drug and dose against the or ders and the protocol, and the identity of the 
patient to receive the MV -NIS.  
UARK [ADDRESS_731913] 21, 2015  
Version 11 
Page 55 of 80 
  The chemotherapy -prepared RN or prescriber educates the patient and/or family about 
the MV -NIS the patient will be receiving.  
 MV-NIS administration is documented against the Medication Administration Record 
(MAR)  in EPIC . A chemotherapy -prepared RN is responsible to review the Order to 
Infuse in EPIC  with each dose to assure that there is agreement with the MAR  and the 
label on the medication.  
 Non-chemotherapy -prepared RNs and LPNs are able to do the following:  
o Monitor the intravenous site for patency  
o Monitor the infusion rate of intravenous cytotoxic medications  
o Interrupt and resume infusions  
o Discontinue infusions when completed.  
Other precautions  – Inpatient Setting:   
 Utensils (e.g., bedpans, urinals) are cleaned with an institutionally approved detergent 
and rinsed twice following each use.  
 The toilet is covered with a white professional towel (plastic side up) and flushed twice. 
The white professional towel is disposed of in a red biohazard bag or biohazard waste 
container.  
 Disposable patient care items contaminated with blood or body secretions are placed in 
a red biohazard bag or biohazard waste container.  
 Soiled linen is placed in a clear plastic bag or a designated  plastic chemotherapy bag 
and then put into a regular linen bag.  
 Eating and drinking are prohibited in the patient’s room during the infusion, and extreme 
precautions are taken while handling needles and other sharp instruments.  
 The p atient should wear a surgical mask when outside of his/her hospi[INVESTIGATOR_557298] . 
 All spi[INVESTIGATOR_357690].  
 A spi[INVESTIGATOR_557299].  Cytotoxic Spi[INVESTIGATOR_557300].   
 In case of a blood or body fluid exposure, thoroughly wash skin with soap and water; 
backbleed when appropriate; thoroughly rinse mucous membranes with water. Promptly 
report all exposures to  management and Employee Health Services. Within 48 hours of 
the exposure, an Employee Incident Report should be completed.  
 
Known potential toxicities of MV -NIS: 
 
The virus was rescued from a derivative of the Edmonston B vaccine strain of MV and we 
antic ipate that the most common toxicities will be similar to those experienced after the 
administration of the MV vaccine. The main reaction associated with MV vaccination is a mild 
MV-like syndrome that occurs in 2 -3% of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_557301] 1 week after vaccin ation. Thus 
patients might experience moderate fever up to 39.4 C and rash (minimal) within the first 5 to 12 
days after virus infusion . However it should be noted that this vaccine related MV-like illness has 
been described only in MV-naïve subjects.  
 
Not uncommon reactions:  
 Moderate to high fever lasting 1 – 2 days, starting within a week or two of vaccination  
 A rash, lasting 1 – 2 days  
 Cough and rhinitis  
 Erythema multiforme  
UARK [ADDRESS_731914] 21, 2015  
Version 11 
Page 56 of 80 
  Arthritis  
 
Unexpected and rare reactions associated with the vaccine:  
 Allergic re actions including anaphylaxis  
 Reactions at the injection site such as a wheal, flare or urticaria  
 Thrombocytopenia  
 Diarrhea  
 Giant cell pneumonia  
 Inclusion body encephalitis  
 Guillain -Barré syndrome  
 Vasculitis  
 Otitis media  
 Optic neuritis  
 Ataxia  
 
Viral tr ansmission between patient and his/her contacts is thought to be unlikely, unless the 
patient develops florid MV infection. The vaccine strain of the MV (of which MV -NIS is a 
derivative) has been shown to be shed in the urine of normal children undergoing routine 
vaccination. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_557302], there has been 
only 1 case of symptomatic MV presumptively transmitted from a vaccinated individual.52  
However, since oth er patients on the UAMS  grounds may be severely immunosuppressed, we 
will require that MV -NIS treated patients wear a surgical  mask when outside of their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_557303] (tested by [CONTACT_16641]-PCR).  
    
We will be partic ularly vigilant for symptoms suggestive of either giant cell pneumonia or 
inclusion body encephalitis that have been rarely observed in immunocompromised patients 
who were administered the vaccine. If symptoms suggestive of persistent MV or either 
pneumoni tis or encephalitis develop, the patients will be treated aggressively with Immune 
Globulin (GamaSTAN)  and ribavirin and all the supportive care necessary as the situation might 
dictate.

 APPENDIX II : RESPONSE CRITERIA AN D SURVIVAL OUTCOME D EFINITIONS  
 
Timing of Response Evaluation  
Response will be evaluated according to the Schedule of Evaluations listed above ( section 6.0)  
Definition of Measurable Disease  
Measurable protein criteria of the serum are defined as serum M -protein of IgG, IgA, IgD, IgE 
Isotype ≥ 1.0 gm/dl (10.0 g/L).   Measurable protein criteria of the urine are defined as urine M -
protein (Bence -Jones Protein) > 200 mg/[ADDRESS_731916] either  20% bone marrow plasm acytosis or >3 lytic 
lesions on skeletal survey.  
Non-Secretory Disease:  Participants without quantifiable M -proteins but with 20% bone 
marrow plasmacytosis will be assessed using plasma cell percentages.  These participants will 
be evaluated for CR, no C R, and progression/relapse using the criteria above.  
Response Criteria : 
 
Multiple Myeloma :  For the purpose of establishing one set of criteria for both Phase II and 
Phase III multiple myeloma studies, the following definitions will be used.  These definit ions are 
based on the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) Uniform Response Criteria for 
Multiple Myeloma43. 
Measurable Disease :  Measurable, quantifiable protein criteria must be present.  Acceptable 
protein criteria are:  
 Serum M protein ≥ 1 g/dL ( ≥ 10 g/L), quantified by [CONTACT_557356] (SPEP).  
AND / OR  
 Urine M protein [Bence -Jones Protein] ≥ 200 mg/24 hrs ( > 0.2 g/24 hrs), quantified by 
24-hour urine protein electrophoresis (UPEP).  
OR 
 Patients who have both se rum M protein levels < 1 g/dL AND urine M protein levels < 
200 mg/24 hrs at baseline may be followed by [CONTACT_557357] (FLC) assay if 
involved free light chain level ≥ 10 mg/dL (≥ 100mg/L).  
Oligosecretory and Non -secretory Disease:   Patients that d o not meet the criteria for 
measurable disease above may only be assessed for the following objective statuses: Stringent 
Complete Response, Stable, and Progression.  
Objective Status:  
Stringent Complete Response (sCR):    
 Meets all of the criteria for Compl ete Response (CR) and   
 normal serum free light chain ratio and 
 absence of clonal cells in bone marrow by [CONTACT_557358] (CR):  
 Disappearance of all evidence of serum and urine M proteins on immunofixation 
elect rophoresis studies and 
UARK [ADDRESS_731917] 21, 2015  
Version 11 
Page 58 of 80 
  ≤ 5% plasma cells in bone marrow and 
 disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas  
Very Good Partial Response (VGPR):  
 Meets all of the criteria for Partial Response (PR) and 
 Serum and urine M proteins detectable by [CONTACT_557359] t not on 
electrophoresis or  
 ≥ 90% reduction in serum M protein and urine M protein < 100 mg/24 hrs.  
Partial Response (PR):  
 ≥ 50% reduction of serum M -protein and reduction in 24 hours urinary M -protein 
by ≥90% or to < 200 mg/24 h  
 If the serum and urine M -protein are unmeasurable at baseline, a ≥50% 
decrease in the difference between involved and uninvolved FLC levels is 
required in place of the M -protein criteria  
 If serum and urine M -protein are not measurable, and serum free light assay is 
also not measur able, ≥50% reduction in plasma cells is required in place of M -
protein, provided baseline bone marrow plasma cell percentage was ≥ 30%  
 In addidion to the above listed criteria, if present at baseline, a ≥ 50% reduction 
in the size of of soft tissue plasmac ytomas is also required  
Stable Disease (SD):  
 Patient does not meet criteria for Stringent Complete Response, Complete 
Response, Very Good Partial Response, Partial Response, or Progression.  
Progression (PD):   Any one or more of the following:  
 Serum M prote in increase ≥ 25% from lowest response value (or an increase of ≥ 
1 g/dL if serum M protein was ≥ 5 g/dL at baseline), with an absolute increase of 
≥ 0.5 g/dL and/or 
 Urine M protein increase ≥ 25% from lowest response value, with an absolute 
increase of ≥ 200 mg/24 hrs and/or 
 Only in patients without measurable serum and urine M -protein levels at 
baseline: ≥ 25% increase from lowest response value in the difference between 
involved and uninvolved serum free light chain level, with an  absolute increase of 
>10 mg/dL  
 Only in patients without measurable serum and urine M -protein levels and 
without measurable disease by [CONTACT_557360], bone marrow plasma cell 
percentage increase ≥ 25% from lowest response value, with the absolute 
plasma cell % ≥ 10%  
 Definite development of new  bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas, or 
definite increase in size of existing bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas 
(see Appendix III: Notes h.)  
 Development of hypercalcemia (corrected serum calcium > 11.5 mg/dL or 2.65  
mmol/L) that can be attributed solely to multiple myeloma  
 
NOTES: If a disease assessment indicates that a patient is experiencing a Stringent 
Complete Response, Complete Response, Very Good Partial Response, Partial 
Response, or Progression, this should be confirmed by a second disease assessment 
and this should be done prior to the institution of any new therapy.  The second disease 
assessment may be done at any time.  
 
CR, sCR, VGPR, and SD categories also require no known evidence of progressive or 
new bone lesions if radiographic studies were performed.  
UARK [ADDRESS_731918] 21, 2015  
Version 11 
Page 59 of 80 
 VGPR and CR categories require serum and urine studies regardless of whether 
disease at baseline was measurable on serum, urine, both, or neither. Radiographic 
studies are not required to satisfy these response requirements. Bone marrow 
assessments need not be confirmed.  
For PD, serum -M component increases of more than or equal to 1 g/dL are sufficient to 
define relapse if starting M -component is ≥ 5 g/dL.  
*Clarifications to IMWG criteria for coding CR and VGPR in patients in whom the only 
measurable disease is by [CONTACT_128758]: CR in such patients indicates a normal FLC 
ration of 0.26 to 1.65 in addition to CR criteria listed above. VGPR  in such patients 
requires a > 90% decrease in the difference b etween involved and uninvolved FLC 
levels.  
†Clarifications to IMWG criteria for coding PD: Bone marrow criteria for PD are to be 
used only in patients without measurable disease by M protein and by [CONTACT_64391]; “25% 
increase” refers to M protein, FLC, and b one marrow results, and does not refer to bone 
lesions, soft tissue plasmacytomas, or hypercalcemia and the “lowest response value” 
does not need to be a confirmed value.  
The size of the soft tissue plasmacytomas is defined as the sum of the products of th e 
cross -diameters of each plasmacytoma.  The size of the bone lesions w ill be determined 
in a similar manner.  A definite increase in the size is defined as a ≥ 50% increase (and 
at least 1 cm2) of this  sum 
Survival Outcomes  
Overall Survival :  measured as the time from initial registration to death from any cause.  
Event -Free Survival :  measured as the time from initial registration to progression/relapse of 
disease or death from any cause .

 APPENDIX III : DRUG INFORMATION  
 
MV-NIS 
 
MV-NIS is a live, tissue culture adapted MV engineered to express the human thyroidal sodium 
iodid e symporter. The virus was constructed by [CONTACT_357746] (cDNA) into a full -length 
infectious molecular clone of an attenuated MV-Edm. This virus is not a vaccine. MV -NIS 
propagates on Vero cells with kinetics equivalent to the parental strain of v irus. It propagates 
selectively in human cancer cells that it infects by [CONTACT_357747]46, a membrane 
protein that is overexpressed in tumor cell lines including MM. The virus is directly cytopathic to 
tumor cells leading to the formation of multinucleated syncytia that die by [CONTACT_20983]. MV -NIS 
infected tumor cells express NIS, a membrane ion channel that actively transports iodide into 
cells. Radioiodine uptake by [CONTACT_557361] n reveal the profile of MV -NIS gene expression and the location of MV -NIS 
infected cells during virus spread and elimination.  
 
Preparation and storage: MV -NIS will be prepared at the Virus and Vector Production 
Laboratory (VVPL) of the Molecular Medicine Program at Mayo Clinic and stored at ≤ -65C. 
The virus will be thawed and mixed with normal saline prior to administration. (See Appendix I ) 
 
Administration: The virus will be administered by [CONTACT_97738] (IV) infusion (30 minutes) in 
100m L of normal saline under close observation in the inpatient unit . (See Appendix I ) 
 
Known potential toxicities: MV -NIS has not been tested in the clinic and therefore, we do not 
know the potential toxicities. Howeve r, the virus was rescued from a derivative of the 
Edmonston B vaccine strain of MV and we anticipate that the most common toxicities will be 
similar to those experienced after the administration of the MV vaccine.52 The main reaction 
associated with MV vaccination is a mild MV-like syndrome that occurs in 2 -3% of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_557304] 1 week after vaccination. Thus patients might experience moderate fever up to 39.4 C 
and rash (minimal) within the first 5 to 12 days  after virus injection. However it should be noted 
that this vaccine related MV-like illness has been described only in MV-naïve subjects.  
 
Not uncommon reactions:  
 Moderate to high fever lasting 1 – 2 days, starting within a week or two of vaccination  
 A rash, lasting 1 – 2 days  
 Cough and rhinitis  
 Erythema multiforme  
 Arthritis  
 
Unexpected and rare reactions associated with the vaccine:  
 Allergic reactions including anaphylaxis  
 Reactions at the injection site such as a wheal, flare or urticaria  
 Thrombocytopeni a 
 Diarrhea  
 Giant cell pneumonia  
 Inclusion body encephalitis

  Optic neuritis  
 Ataxia  
 
We will be particularly vigilant for symptoms suggestive of either giant cell pneumonia or 
inclusion body encephalitis th at have been rarely observed in immunocompromised patients 
who were administered the vaccine.  53  If symptoms suggestive of persistent MV or either 
pneumonit is or encephalitis develop, the patients will be treated aggressively with Immune 
Globulin (GamaSTAN)  and ribavirin and all the supportive care necessary as the situation 
might dictate.54 
 
Risks to caretakers and other Clinic Patients  
Viral transmission between patient and his/her contacts is thought to be unlikely, unless the 
patient develops florid MV infection. The vaccine st rain of the MV (of which MV -NIS is a 
derivative) has been shown to be shed in the urine of normal children undergoing routine 
vaccination. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_557302], there has been 
only 1 case of symptomatic MV presumptively transmitted from a vaccinated individual.55 
However, since other patients on UAMS  grounds may be severely immunosuppressed, we will 
require that MV -NIS-treated patients wear a surgical mask when outside of their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_557305] (tested by [CONTACT_16641]-PCR).  
 
 
Sodium Pertechnetate  - 99mTcO 4 
 
PHARMACOLOGY: The pertechnetate ion distributes in the body similarly to the  iodide ion, but 
is not organified when trapped in the thyroid gland. Pertechnetate tends to accumulate in 
intracranial lesions with excessive neovascularity or an altered blood -brain barrier. It also 
concentrates in the thyroid gland, salivary glands, gas tric mucosa, and choroids plexus. 
However, in contrast to the iodide ion, the pertechnetate ion is released unchanged from the 
thyroid gland.  After intravascular administration, the pertechnetate ion remains in the circulatory 
system for sufficient time t o permit blood pool measurement, organ perfusion, and major vessel 
studies. It gradually equilibrates with the extravascular space. A small fraction is promptly 
excreted via the kidneys.  
  
Indications  
 
Sodium Pertechnetate 99mTcO 4 is used IN ADULTS as an agent for:  
 Brain Imaging (including cerebral radionuclide angiography)  
 Thyroid Imaging  
 Salivary Gland Imaging  
 Placenta Localization  
 Blood Pool Imaging (including radionuclideangiography)  
 Urinary Bladder Imaging (direct isotopic cystography) for detection o f vesico -ureteral 
reflux  
 
Nasolacrimal Drainage System Imaging  (dacryoscintigraphy)  Sodium Pertechnetate 99mTcO 4 is 
used IN PEDIATRIC  PATIENTS as an agent for:  
 Brain Imaging (including cerebral radionuclide  angiography)  
 Thyroid Imaging  
 Blood Pool Imaging ( including radionuclide  angiography)

  Urinary Bladder Imaging (direct isotopic  
 cystography) for the detection of vesico -ureteral  reflux  
 
CONTRAINDICATIONS  
None known.  
 
Known potential toxicities  
 
Allergic reactions including anaphylaxis have been reported in frequently following administration, 
however, no toxicity is expected from the diagnostic doses of 99mTcO 4 to be used in this study.  
 
WARNINGS  
 
Radiation risks associated with the use of Sodium  Pertechnetate 99mTcO 4 are greater in 
pediatric patients  
than i n adults and, in general, the younger the patient  the greater the risk owing to greater 
absorbed radiation  doses and longer life expectancy. These greater risks  should be taken firmly 
into account in all benefit risk  assessments involving pediatric patient s. Only use generator 
eluant specified for use with the  
Ultra -TechneKow™ DTE Generator. Do not use any other  generator eluant or saline from any 
other source.  
 
PRECAUTIONS  
 
As in the use of any radioactive material, care should  be taken to minimize radiati on exposure to 
the patient  consistent with proper patient management and to insure  minimum radiation 
exposure to occupational workers.  Radiopharmaceuticals should be used only by  [CONTACT_557362] h andling of radionuclides and 
whose  experience and training have been approved by [CONTACT_557363].  
After the termination of the nasolacrimal imaging  procedure, blowing the nose and washing the  
eyes with  sterile distilled water or an isotonic sodium chloride  solution will further minimize the 
radiation dose.  Since the eluate does not contain an antimicrobial  agent, it should not be used 
after [ADDRESS_731922] -feedings.  
 
Dosage and Administratio n 
 
Sodium Pertechnetate 99mTcO 4 is usually administered by [CONTACT_439], but can be 
given orally.  
 
For imaging the urinary bladder and ureters, (direct isotopic cystography), the sodium 
perytechnetate 99mTcO [ADDRESS_731923] six (6) hours before and two (2) hours after 
administration. When imaging the nasolacrimal drainage system, instill the sodium 
pertechnetate 99mTcO 4 injection by [CONTACT_2224] a device such as a micropi[INVESTIGATOR_557306] e nsure the accuracy of the dose.

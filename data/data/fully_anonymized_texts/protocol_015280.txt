2 STUDY SUMMARY  
Title PREVLAR : A Phase 2a Randomized, Parallel Group, Open -Label, Multicenter Study to 
Assess the Safety and Efficacy of Different Schedules of RRx -001 in the Attenuation of 
Oral Mucositis in Patients Receiving Concomitant Chemoradiation for the Treatment of 
Locally Advanced Squamous Cell Carcinomas of the Oral Cavity or Oropharynx 
Phase  Phase 2 a 
Patient Population  Pathologically -confirmed diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC ) of the oral cavity or 
oropharynx planned to be treated with cisplatin plus concurrent IMRT  
Note: Patients with unknown HPV positive primary tumors  (SCC) whose treatment plan 
matches the requirements specified in Inclusion Criteria # 2 below are eligible for the trial  
Objectives Safety:  
To assess the safety and tolerability  of varying dosing schedules  of RRx -[ADDRESS_1043028] concomitant 
chemoradiation.  
Efficacy:  
To assess the efficacy of RRx -001 in the attenuation of  severe oral mucositis (SOM)  in 
patients receiving cisplatin and radiation therapy for the treatment cancers of the oral cavity 
or oropharynx .  
Number of Patients Approximately [ADDRESS_1043029] regimen of tri -weekly cisplatin plus concomitant IMRT in patients being treated for 
cancers of the oral cavity or oropharynx.  
Patients meeting the eligibility criteria and consenting to participate will be randomized 1:1:1:1 to one of the three regimens of RRx -001 or a control (~10 patients per arm)  with 1 
stratification factor (two levels: oral cavity or oropharynx) : 
Arm 1: “RRx -001 P re-Treatment + SOC  Chemoradiation ” 
Two infusions of RRx -001 will be given each week during the two weeks prior to the 
start of chemoradiation  (four doses total). No additional RRx -001 will be given during 
chemoradiation . 
Arm 2: “RRx -001 P re-Treatment + 2 Concurrent Doses +  SOC  Chemoradiation ” 
Two infusions of RRx -[ADDRESS_1043030] 
radiation day in each of weeks 2 and 5 during chemoradiation  
Arm 3: “RRx -001 Pr e-Treatment + 6 Concurrent Doses + SOC  Chemoradiation ” 
Two infusions of RRx -[ADDRESS_1043031] 6 weeks during chemoradiation  
Arm 4: “ SOC Chemoradiation  Only (Control)”  
No doses of RRx -[ADDRESS_1043032] of care chemoradiation  
IND 107,674/Serial No. [ADDRESS_1043033] of care  (SOC)  chemoradiation  in the form of a 7 -week 
course of fractionated radiation therapy concurrent with a  QW or Q3W  cisplatin regimen . 
Cisplatin should not be given within 24 hours of RRx -001 administrations.   
All doses of RRx -001 will be given at 4 mg per infusion. Administration of RRx -001 will 
not be blinded, so patient and study staff may be aware of the treatment assignment.  
The study will be performed in four stages:  
1. Screening phase (≤ 4 weeks before randomization).  Patients assessed for eligibility.  
2. Pre-Treatment and Combination Treatment dosing periods .  This will consist of the 
time beginning two weeks prior to the start of chemo radiation (Pre-Treatment) and 
ending on the last day of radiation therapy (LDRT). A baseline assessment will be 
performed on the first day of RRx -[ADDRESS_1043034] Treatment “ Mucositis Observation Follow -up”.  This will consist of the time 
from the end of IMRT  until ulcerative oral mucositis grade is < 1 (WHO scale) 
4. Long -term follow -up will consist of the 12 months from the LDRT.   
Patients will be followed for safety endpoints throughout the study. Patients will be evaluated for the presence and severity of oral mucositis during the course of chemoradiation  and following end of treatment until oral mucositis grade is  < 1.   
During the combination treatment  period  (until end of radiotherapy ), mucositis severity will 
be assessed twice weekly by [CONTACT_407920] . Following the end of radiotherapy  (known 
as the “Mucositis Observation Follow -up”), mucositis will be assessed once weekly until 
resolution (WHO grade 0 or 1 ) of ulcerative mucositis .  
Patients in the study will be followed for  one year following radiotherapy (IM RT), in order 
to evaluate  long-term  safety and tumor outcomes.

Statistical Methods  Safety Endpoints:  
• Incidence of adverse events, including serious adverse events (SAEs) and clinically 
significant laboratory abnormalities.   
• Overall tumor response to treatment using RECIST or si te preference criteria. 
Efficacy Endpoints:  
• Duration (in days) of severe oral mucositis (SOM, WHO grades 3 or 4) 
• Time  (in days) to onset of SOM 
• Incidence of SOM  
• Incidence and duration of ulcerative mucositis (WHO grades 2, 3, 4) 
• Patient- reported mucositis pain as measured by [CONTACT_53007] 2 of the Oral Mucositis 
Daily Questionnaire  
Design:    
This is a randomized, open -label, parallel group, Phase [ADDRESS_1043041] chemoradiation therapy consisting of cisplatin either every three weeks (100 mg/m2 
for 3 doses) or weekly (40 mg/m2 for 7 doses)  + radiotherapy ( IMRT) administered daily 
(except weekends) for 7 weeks.  In conjunction with this “standard of care” (SOC), patients 
will be randomly assigned to receive one of 3 regimens of RRx -001 or a control (no 
treatment).  
Sample  Size:    
A sample size of approximately 40 patients (~ 10 per group) is considered adequate for this  
proof -of-concept  (POC ) study to explore the radioprotective potential of RRx -001 and 
identify a safe regimen for further development.    
Statistical Methods : 
Efficacy and safety data will be summarized using descriptive statistics, including the mean, 
standard deviations, median, minimum and maximum for continuous endpoints and 
frequency tables for categorical data.   
Efficacy Analysis:   
Hypothesis testing o f efficacy endpoints will be performed for exploratory purposes only. 
For continuous efficacy endpoints, non -parametric methods will be used to compare each 
RRx-001 group to the untreated control group (Wilcoxon rank -sum tests).  Fisher’s exact 
test will b e used to evaluate treatment differences for binary outcomes. Two -sided 95% 
confidence intervals will be calculated for proportions using the Clopper -Pearson method.  
Safety Analysis:  
Safety data , including  adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs ), ECOG 
performance status, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs and physical examination results will  
be listed and summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_1570] . Adverse events will be coded by

IND 107,674/Serial No. [ADDRESS_1043043] common form of the disease with over 
500,000 new cases this year.  In the [LOCATION_002], head and cancers account for approximately 
3% of all cancers with over 60,[ADDRESS_1043044] common histologic subtype (90%), squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).  However, over recent decades the predominant pathoetiology of HNC has shifted 
from carci nogen- induced mucosal transformation to HPV- mediated cancer .  Th is shift has 
impacted the clinical presentation, epi[INVESTIGATOR_623], management and prognosis of the disease.  
Firstly, unlike tobacco -related HNSCC, which present s in the oral cavity (tongue/floor of 
mouth), HPV -related cancers mainly develop  from the  orophary nx.  Second ly, HPV- driven 
tumors tend to affect a significantly younger patient population  with less extensive tobacco 
exposure and a better performance status  compar ed to HPV- negative tumors, thereby  
[CONTACT_761707] “ curative ” treatment.  Third ly, HPV- related cancers are 
significantly more treatment -responsive than tobacco -associated squamous cell cancers of the 
head and neck , which may tip the balance in favor of non- surgical man agement . And, finally, 
HPV impart s a better prognosis in terms of tumor control and  survival .   
Regardless of the etiology, the vast majority of patients with locally invasive cancers of the 
mouth or oropharynx are treated with concomitant chemoradiation , a combination that is 
superior to radiation alone  since chemotherapy increases the susceptibility of the tumor cell to 
radiation -induced lysis.  For locally advanced disease (Stages II -IVB), the standard of care is 
concurrent chemoradiation therapy in lieu  of or in addition to surgery. Conventional 
fractionation for concurrent chemoradiation is up to 70 Gy (2.0 Gy/fraction; daily Monday -
Friday in 7wk).  Cisplatin, given as a radiosensitizer, is typi[INVESTIGATOR_761686]: either every thr ee weeks during radiation ( 100 mg/m
2) or weekly as a lower dose 
(40 mg/m2).  Recent data suggests that the higher dose regimen has better survival benefit.  
Oral mucositis is among the most common and devastating acute toxicities associated with 
radiation t herapy to the head and neck.  The characteristic ulcerative lesions , which occur on the 
oropharyngeal mucosa included in the radiation fields are associated with progressive, 
unrelenting pain that profoundly impacts  quality of life in multiple dimensions .  As a case in 
point, t he poem below, written by a patient with mucositis, vividly and graphically 
communicates the extreme suffering due to mucositis , forcing  the reader  to vicariously

Due to the severe oral morbidity , mucositis may impact the ability to eat normally.  
Consequently, changes to liquid -based diets are common and, in about a quarter of cases, 
percutaneous feeding via a gastrostomy feeding tube a nd/or parenteral nutrition is required .  
Ulcerative m ucositis is a significant cause of unscheduled chemoradiation treatment breaks, 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_160130] a week , which  may improve palliation at the expense of survival .  In 
granulocytopenic patient s, oral mucositis  is a potential  site of secondary infection and portal of 
entry for the indigenous oral flora , often leading to bacteremia and sepsis.  Finally,  mucositis 
drives healthcare resource use and costs  through emergency room visits , surgical insertion of 
feeding tubes  and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602].  It is not surprising that the incremental cost of mucositis 
exceeds $17,[ADDRESS_1043046] week of treatment  (cumulative radiation 
dose of 10 Gy) and consist primarily of mucosal erythema and symptoms akin to a burned mouth 
from hot food or drink that are easily controlled with standard OTC pain medications. At 
cumulative radiation doses  of 20 Gy to 30 Gy, t he integrity of the mucosa break s down and 
mucosal ulcerations  that are usually limited to the movable mucosa (the more keratinized 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_761687], dorsal tongue and gingiva are unaffected) , occur .  Unlike common 
oral ulcers like aphthous stomatitis, the ulcers associated with mucositis are irregular, deep and disproportionately painful , requiring more aggressive symptom management  such as  the use of 
narcotic analgesia.  Ulceration severity usually peaks at radiation doses of around 50 Gy (end of  
week 5).  The lesions expand and become confluent.  Breakthrough pain, even with morphine or 
fentanyl is not uncommon.  Lesions typi[INVESTIGATOR_761688] 2-[ADDRESS_1043047] 
consistent  and widely used. This scale, which  has been effectively used in clinical trials , is based 
on a combination of functional (ability to eat) and objective (presence of ulceration or erythem a) 
criteria. WHO scores correlate with patient -reported outcomes, analgesic use and resource use.  
Other available  scales include RTOG and NCI -CTCv5 , which have evolved to contain elements 
that are similar to WHO criteria.

culmina tes in epi[INVESTIGATOR_761690], atrophy, ulceration and healing  [Sonis 1998]. 
To date, palifermin (KGF1), a pleiotropic growth factor , is the only agent approved for mucositis 
and its use is limited to patients receiving stomatotoxic conditioning regimens prior to 
hematologic stem cell transplant.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_761691]/or treat OM, which includes dusquetide, an immunomodulatory peptide, GC4419, a

to topi[INVESTIGATOR_761692], opi[INVESTIGATOR_761693], ice chips (cryotherapy) and oral rinses such as “magic mouthwashes” that vary in composition depending 
on institutiona l folklore.   None of these approaches has  adequately mitigat ed the clinical 
development of mucositis or its symptoms. Thus,  the degree of the  unmet need in mucositis is 
related to the severity of symptoms  and the lack of an approved treatment regimen , whi ch, if 
addressed, would substantially  improve quality of life and treatment outcomes for  head & neck  
cancer patients.  
The rationale for this trial is that RRx -001, as a systemically non- toxic putative dual 
radiochemoprotector/ sensitizer  with activity in m ultiple tumors types including small cell 
carcinoma of the oral cavity , will protect the normal mucosa but not the tumor  and delay the 
duration of  oral toxicity.  
3.2 Nonclinical Studies  
3.2.1 RRx -001 Antitumor Activity 
RRx-001 is a novel anticancer agent  of the dini troazetidine class that has demonstrated 
selectivity of action in tumor cells versus normal tissues, and inhibition  of tumor growth in vivo  
with minimal  toxicity  [Das 2016; Ning 2012] . The activity of RRx -001 is thought to be 
associated with a nucleophilic substitution by [CONTACT_761708] -001 to cysteinyl residues in red blood cell hemoglobin. This binding event is responsible 
for the autooxidation of hemoglobin and the generation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species 
(RONS) inside red blood cells (RBCs)  [Reid 2015] . Nitro -oxidative stress leads to plasma 
membrane translocation of phosphatidylserine (PS), which in turn is involved in PS -mediated 
erythrocyte  adhesion to the hypoxic tumor vasculature. Allosteric modification of hemoglobin by 
[CONTACT_761709] -[ADDRESS_1043049] catalyzes the reduction of nitrite to nitric oxide under these hypoxic 
conditions and normalizes the tumor vasculature, resulting i n improved tumor oxygenation and 
response to radiation treatment [ Brouse 2015] .  Endocytosis of RRx -001- adducted red blood 
cells by [CONTACT_761710] M1 phenotype and 
immunosensitization via release of inflammatory chemokines and cytokines [ Oronsky 2017a ]. 
3.2.2 RRx -001 Combination with Cisplatin  
The effects of combined treatment of RRx -001 and cisplatin were evaluated.  Mice received 
vehicle or RRx -001 via intravenous injection at 5 mg/kg for 3 times, once every 48 hours prior to 
receiving intraperitoneal injection of cisplatin 2 mg/kg for 5 times, once every other day.  Pretreatment with RRx -001 significantly attenuated the cisplatin -induced reduction in 
hematolo gical parameters (hemoglobin concentration, leukocyte count and platelet count) 
indicative of protection against these toxic effects in bone marrow.  In addition, there was a trend 
IND 107,674/Serial No. [ADDRESS_1043050] reduction in cisplatin -induced renal toxicity with apparent attenuat ion of increases in 
serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels.  When the combination was tested in mice 
bearing sarcoma 180 tumors, RRx -001 treatment appeared to attenuate the body weight loss 
caused by [CONTACT_761711] [Oronsky 2017 b].  
3.2.3 RRx -001 Radiosensitization of Tumor Cells  
When combined in vitro  with radiation, RRx -001 (1 μM) shifted the radiation survival curves of 
tumor cell lines downward.  The radiation survival at 2Gy was decreased from 72% to 12% in 
HT29 cells and from 89% to 1.4% in SCC VII cells.  At 10Gy, RRx -001 further decreased the 
radiation survival from 1.3% to 0.07% for HT29 cells and from 3.3% to 0.03% in SCC VII cells.  
The radiation dose modifying factors (DMFs) of RRx -001 were 1.7 and 1.6 at 10% survival for 
HT29 and SCC VII cells, respectively.  The in vivo  radiosensitizing pro perties of RRx -001 were 
demonstrated in mice bearing SCC VII tumor xenografts.  Tumor -bearing mice were treated with 
either 5 mg/kg RRx -001 i.p. daily for 5 days or local tumor irradiation of 250 cGy for 5 days or 
both.  Either radiation alone or RRx- 001 alone inhibited tumor growth and produced tumor 
growth delay (TGD) times of 3.2 ± 1.8 days and 1.8 ± 0.6 days, respectively.  The combination of radiation and RRx -001 resulted in a statistically significant lengthening TGD time of 7.0 ± 2.1 
days.  Higher da ily doses of radiation (400 cGy) and RRx -001 (6 mg/kg) enhanced the 
therapeutic efficacy of radiotherapy and prolonged the TGD time from 7.9 ± 2.4 days for 
radiation alone to 13.9 ± 1.9 days for combination therapy.  Each combination regimen did not 
cause a significant decrease in animal body weight compared with untreated control mice or 
radiation -treated mice [ Ning 2012].  
3.2.4 RRx -001 Radioprotection of Normal Cells  
Mice were treated with vehicle or RRx -001 10 mg/kg i.p. 24 hours pr ior to irradiation (9.35 Gy 
delivered at 0.6 Gy/min).  Survival was evaluated over [ADDRESS_1043051] -exposure and was 
significantly increased in the RRx -001- treated mice, 67% compared to 33%  in vehicle -treated 
mice  (p<0.005) . In addition, RRx -001- treated mice s howed  accelerated  recovery of bone marrow 
cellularity and Colony Forming Units compared to vehicle -treated mice after a sublethal total 
body radiation exposure (7 Gy delivered at 0.6 Gy/min) ( Jurgensen  et al., 2017 Radiation 
Research Society ).  In another study, RRx-001 treatment enhanced intestinal stem cell (crypt 
cell) survival and regeneration in mice that were exposed to total body irradiation of 10 -15 Gy in 
combination with RRx -001 (10 mg/kg i.p.) as compared to mice treated with radiation alone 
[Scicinski 2015].  
3.2.5 RRx -001 Toxicology  
Repeated -dose toxicity studies of RRx -001 ( 3 times/week up to 4 weeks in duration) were 
conducted in rats at dose levels of 12, 20.1 and 30 mg/kg per day and in dogs at dose levels of 4, 
8 and 12 mg/kg per day  (due to clinical signs the 8 and 12 mg/kg doses were reduced to 3 and 
5 mg/kg on Day 4) .  The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) was < 12 mg/kg in rats and 
5 mg/kg in dogs .  Target organs of RRx -001 in rats were spleen and lungs.  Effects on lungs  
were observed in dogs .  RRx -001 was genotoxic in the in vitro  bacterial reverse mutation assay .

3.3 Clinical Experience with RRx -001 
3.3.1 Safety  
To date, based on the sum of the data from 9 total Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials, RRx -001 is well 
tolerat ed over time with a consistently favorable safety profile in which the majority of serious 
adverse events are cancer -related.  The two main (and arguably the only) RRx -001 related 
adverse events are: 1) non -dangerous infusion site reactions and 2) immune -mediated 
pseudoprogression or tumor flare, which is generally a favorable sign despi[INVESTIGATOR_761694].  A total of approximately [ADDRESS_1043052] resulted from 
disease progression or intercurrent illness.  No evidence of drug- related organ damage 
(hepatotoxicity, cardiotoxicity, renal toxicity, pulmonary toxicity or bone marrow suppression) 
or clinically relevant changes in physical examination,  vital signs, EKG, and hematology or 
clinical chemistry parameters have been observed over time.  
In concurrent combination with radiation, chemotherapy (temozolomide and irinotecan) and 
immunotherapy (nivolumab), the serious adverse events that have been o bserved are consistent 
with the known toxicity profiles of these other agents.  
When dosed as a single agent until progression followed sequentially with chemotherapy,

Overall RRx -001 has been well tolerated (especially when co -infused with autologous blood) 
both alone and in combination with minimal to no  evidence of systemic toxicity.   Two serious 
adverse events  (SAEs)  have been attributed by [INVESTIGATOR_678] s to single agent RRx -001: 
1. Rectal bleeding in a colorectal patient with an elevated INR  and daily aspi[INVESTIGATOR_34308]  
2. Ischemic stroke in a patient with brain metastases and multip le vascular risk factors 
including morbid obesity,  untreated hypercholesterolemia and a previous history of

3.3.3 Metabolism 
In blood, RRx -001 reacts non -enzymatically and covalently with reduced glutathione (GSH), and 
with the beta93Cys residue of hemoglobin (Hb), forming RRx -001-G SH and RRx-001- Hb 
metabolites, respectively.  Pharmacokinetics  given the rapid conversion of the RRx- 001 parent 
molecule to its glutathione (GSH) and hemoglobin conjugates, RRx -001- GSH, as the 
predominant measurable metabolite in the plasma, was chosen as a surrogate for drug exposure. 
Terminal half -life of RRx -001- GSH was calculated as approximately 30 minutes.  AUC and C max 
were mostly dose proportional for doses up to 55 mg/m2 in Phase 1.  Unfortunately, since the red 
blood cell is the main intermediary of RRx -001 activity (and local toxicity), the absorption, 
distribution, metabolism and excretion profile of the GSH conjugate is not a useful or relevant 
measure of the pharmacology and safety of RRx -001.

optimal frequency of dosing was determined to be once weekly, although twice weekly has also

4 PROPOSED MECHANISMS OF RADIOPROTECTION 
RRx-001 bound to hemoglo bin in red blood cells produces reactive oxygen and nitrogen species , 
which leads to compensatory  anti-inflammatory gene expression  in tissues from  upregulation of 
Nrf2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2 -related factor 2), a regulatory transcription factor with a  critical 
role in the antioxidant response pathway .  The protective role of Nrf2 was evaluated in m ice 
bearing SSC VII tumor xenografts that received a single intravenous dose of RRx -001 
(10 mg/kg) . Histological examination of the tumors demonstrated that the intensity of Nrf2 
(nuclear factor erythroid 2 -related factor 2) cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins was dramatically  
higher in RRx-001- treated tumors compared to that in control tumors .  This higher nuclear 
expression of Nrf2  suggest s that after RRx-001 t reatment Nrf2 translocates to the nucleus and 
induces antioxidant gene expression . The downstream expression of Nrf2 -activated antioxidant 
enzymes , heme oxygenase 1 and NAD(P)H dehydrogenase quinone , was assessed both in vitro  
and in vivo  in SCC VII tumor cells  following RRx -001 treatment  and showed a time -dependent 
increase of  expression  [Ning 2015] .  Hence, it is hypothesized that  RRx-[ADDRESS_1043056] s tissues 
from radiation injury via Nrf2 nuclear translocation and upregulation of multiple antioxidant 
pathways , which minimizes oxidative stress and maintains  the redox status .

It is also the objective of the study to assess the efficacy of RRx -001 in the attenuation of severe

cancers of the oral cavity or oropharynx.  
 
6 STUDY DESIGN  
6.1 Description of the Study  
The purpose of this proof -of-concept study is to determine  whether RRx -001 has the potential to  
reduce the severity and duration of oral mucositis, an acute inflammatory  condition , which 
generally peaks within 3 weeks after the start of chemoradiation therapy and, in the majority of 
cases, subsides shortly after the cessation of therapy.  
This is a 4 ‐arm Phase [ADDRESS_1043058] 
chemora diation therapy  (concomitant cisplatin and radiation therapy) are randomized to receive 
one of three different regimens of RRx -001 (experimental groups) or standard care alone (control

administered daily (excepting weekends) for 7 weeks.  No additional RRx -001 will be given 
during the course of chemoradiation . 
Arm 2 : “RRx-001 Pre-Treatment  + 2 Concurrent Doses  + SOC  Chemoradiation  (IMRT + 
Cisplatin) ” 
Two infusions of RRx -001 4 mg with 10 mg dexamethasone as a premedication will be given

8.1.2 RRx -001 Administration  
RRx-001 t reatment will  be administered on an out patient  basis.  Patients will receive 4 mg of 
RRx-001, premixed with the patient’s blood prior to reinfusion , per the schedule outlined in the 
study schema ( Section 1.1).  
The administration procedure of RRx -001 incorporates the use of an in -line filter ‘device’ as an 
added patient safety element; though likely unnecessary, given the patient’s own blood is being 
drawn into a syringe containing anticoagulant, where the study drug (RRx -001) is subsequentl y 
transferred to mix with the blood, followed by [CONTACT_607155], within approximately 15 minutes from start of blood draw, all inside a closed sterile assembly.   
The filter ‘device’ is a clinical use in -line blood f ilter and is part of an FDA approved Neonatal 
Syringe Set that is used to deliver small aliquots of whole blood.  Modification was made for our use by [CONTACT_3455], both to the tubing length (adding approximately 3”) and tubing ends 
(changing the previ ously female luer connector to a male luer connector on 1 end, and a 
removing an IV bag spi[INVESTIGATOR_607106] a male luer connector on the opposite end), thus 
making this technically ‘off label’ use.   
Appropriate in -use studies have been conducted with this filter ‘device’ and these results along 
with the following device labeling: ‘CAUTION —Investigational device for use with RRx -001.

RRx-[ADDRESS_1043064] version of 
the pharmacy manual.  
The methodology for administering the RRx -001 dose by [CONTACT_22268]’s blood that 
has been anticoagulated with Acid -Citrate -Dextrose Formula A (ACD -A) is based on procedures 
used in blood product transfusions .  Standard procedures for avoiding hemolysis will be 
followed. These include the use of large gauge IV needles (19g or larger  preferred ) and slow 
consistent rate during blood draw to avoid undue mechanical shear stress to red blood cells.

Whenever blood is present during the administration procedure, handle with care and do not 
shake.  Avoid excessive temperatures, (both high and low temperatures can cause hemolysis). 
Avoid conditions that create high turbulence or trauma to the red blood cells.   
RRx -001 Therapy Administration Procedure in the Clinic : 
The RRx- [ADDRESS_1043065] patient (using patient identifiers noted on labeling) ; that the RRx -001 and anticoagulant  
are mixed with the patient's autologous blood; and that the mixture is re-infused back to the 
correct patient.  DO NOT proceed with administration if any discrepancies are noted.  
Administration procedure steps should be followed carefully and can be found in the latest version of the ‘Blood Administration Best Practices & Guidelines for IV Infusion of RRx -001 + 
Blood Mix’.  Safety guidelines are based on procedures used in blood product transfusions.  It  is 
important  each  step is followed in the order outlined in the  guide to maintain sterility at all

8.3.2 Dosing Delays/Dosing Modifications : Cisplatin  
• Neutropenia: If on the day of scheduled treatment with cisplatin the absolute neutrophil 
count (ANC) is < 1200, hold treatment until ANC ≥ 1200, then treat at 100% dose. 
Neutropenic fever will require permanent 25%  dose reduction.  Per CTCAE, v.  5.0, 
febrile neutropenia is described as ANC < 1000/mm3 with a singl e temperature of 
> 38.3 degrees C (101 degrees F) or a sustained temperature of ≥ 38 degrees  C 
(100.4 degrees F) for more than 1 hour.  
• Thrombocytopenia: If on the day of scheduled treatment with cisplatin the platelet count 
is < 75,000, hold treatment unti l platelets are > 75,000, then treat at 100% dose. 
Thrombocytopenia that results in bleeding will require a 25% dose reduction  
• Neurotoxicity: If any signs of grade 3 or greater neurotoxicity occur, discontinue 
cisplatin. Continue radiation therapy (RT).  
• Renal Adverse Events: Cisplatin should be administered on the scheduled day of 
treatment using the following guidelines. Note: If creatinine is > 1.2 mg/dL , clearance 
must be calculated (Cockcroft -Gault) in order to make dose adjustment. If the calculated 
nomogram is 50 mL/min or above, a 24- hour urine collection is not needed, but if the 
calculation is less than 50 mL/min, a 24 -hour urine collection is mandated.

• Other Adverse Events  
o Mucositis: Significant mucositis from radiation and cisplatin is expected and will not be an indication for cisplatin dose modification. No cisplatin dose reductions will be made.  
o Ototoxicity: For new clinical hearing loss not requiring a hearing aid or for 
tinnitus that interferes with activities of daily living, treat at 50% dose reduction. 
For hearing loss requiring a hearing aid, discontinue cisplatin. Continue RT and

8.4 Missed or Omitted Doses and Alternative Treatment Schedules  
8.4.1 Missed Doses: RRx -001  
If doses of RRx-001 doses are missed thos e doses will be skipped .  If all the doses of RRx -001 
are missed that patient may be considered non -evaluable.   The missed  or omitted dose(s)  and the 
reason for omission  should be recorded.  
8.4.2 Missed  or Omitted Dos es: Cisplatin  
In the event of any grade 3 or 4 even t, treatment will be  delayed.  If the delay is more than 
21 days because of hematologic or renal adverse events, that dose will be omitted.   If a dose of 
cisplatin is missed or omitted, it will not be made up or added to the end of treatment. 
If radiotherapy is held, cisplatin should similarly be held and resumed when radiation resumes . 
In this case, the cisplatin dose is not considered skipped or omitted, but delayed .

11 EFFICACY ASSESSMENTS 
11.1 Oral Mucositis (OM) Assessments  
Mucositis assessments will be completed at the screening visit, day 1 of pretreatment prior to administration of RRx -001, twice weekly (no less than 48 hours apart) within each 5- day 
radiation week during  the combination  treatment phase, at the end of the combination treatment 
phase (last day of radiation) and the same day each week (± 1 day) during the Mucositis 
Observation Follow -up until resolution of ulcerative mucositis occurs (WHO grade 0 or 1).  
Oral mucositis will be assessed by a trained evaluator using a standard oral mucositis assessment 
instrument.  If a patient  withdraws prior to the end of the combination treatment phase, an oral 
assessment must be completed on the day of withdrawal, and it is suggested that patients be 
assessed weekly until resolution of ulcerative mucositis occurs (WHO grade 0 or 1) .  Patients 
will be instructed not to discuss their treatment regimens with the assessor.  Additionally, the 
assessor will be provided training  to assure uniform interactions with patients to limit bias in the 
assessment.  
Specific training and instructions are required for all individuals who perform mucositis 
assessments.  Such training will be provided by [CONTACT_3552].  Site study st aff 
IND 107,674/Serial No. [ADDRESS_1043069] be licensed professionals and properly delegated such tasks  
(on DOA log) .  Oral evaluators will conduct all assessments using a standardized and consistent 
method.  To reduce inter -observer variabilit y, as few oral evaluators as possible should be 
involved in the assessments of an individual patient.  Ideally, the same assessor will evaluate a 
single patient throughout the combination treatment and mucositis observation follow -up.  All 
efforts to maint ain uniformity  should be used.  
The study’s efficacy endpoints will be based on WHO mucositis criteria.  Since patients’ ability 
to eat is a component of the  WHO scale, standardization of the assessment of food intake and, 
particularly , the definition of solids, liquids and “nothing by [CONTACT_1966] ” is critical.  
• A normal solid diet is defined as firm, shaped food that does not flow or conform to the 
shape of its container and  requires chewing. Examples include rice, meat including fish, 
poultry, bread, rolls, toast, salad, cereal.  
• A modified soft solid diet consists of foods that do not conform to the shape of its 
container, still require minimal chewing, but are less dense than standard solids. Examples include eggs, pasta, fruit  or soup.
 
• For the purposes of the cl inical trial mucositis assessment, liquids are defined as foods 
that take the shape of their container and which don’t require chewing.   In addition to things we typi[INVESTIGATOR_761696], milk shakes, smoothies or frappes, also heavil y pureed foods, yogurt, oatmeal and jello fall into this category.
 
• The “nothing by [CONTACT_1966]” category is appropriate for patients who can’t eat or swallow 
EXCEPT for medication. Please note that sips of water used to help aid in swallowing 
medication still co nstitute a “nothing by [CONTACT_1966]” selection. This would also be the best 
option for patients who require the assistance of a feeding tube.  
 
11.2 Pain Assessments  
Pain will be assessed with the OMDQ Question 2 (mouth and throat soreness or MTS), which 
will be comple ted daily from baseline until oral mucositis assessment grade [ADDRESS_1043070] any 
analgesic use, including name, dose, and frequency of dose, in the OMDQ Booklet .  Information 
from the source documents and the diary wi ll be recorded into the EDC system  as a concomitant 
medication . Analgesics will be converted to morphine equivalents at the time of data analysis.  
11.4 Other Assessments  
Frequency and duration of interruptions in radiation therapy will be recorded.

11.5 Tumor Asse ssments  
Tumor assessments will be performed according to the schedule of assessments . The patient ’s 
tumor response will be assessed using RECIST v1.1 [ Eisenhauer et al. 2009 ] until progression , 
start of next therapy  or unt il end of Long Term Follow -up, whichever comes first  [Appendix B ]. 
When measurable disease is not present (e.g. post -operative patien ts), RECIST v1.1 assessment 
is not performed until measurable disease presents  (this is consid ered progression and no further 
assessments will be done)  or start of next therapy .  Tumor status information will be collected 
and will include disease progression, and survival. During the follow up period, data will be 
collected at standard of care intervals, i.e., month 3 ( ± 7 days) and also at months 6, 9 and 12 
(each ± 14 days) following the last day of combination therapy  to document start date of 
subsequent therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] . 
 
12 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
The safety of RRx -001 will be assessed through collection an d analyses of adverse events (AEs) 
and laboratory tests.    
12.[ADDRESS_1043071] of monitoring and reporting adverse events (AEs) and serious 
adverse events (SAEs) that are considered related to RRx -001, cisplati n or radiation therapy, all 
events of death, and any study specific issue of concern.  
12.1.1  Adverse Events  
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a pre-existing medical condition in a patient  or clinical investiga tion patient  administered an 
investigational (medicinal) product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable or unintended sign (including abnormal 
laboratory finding, for example), symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of 
investigational product, whether or not considered related to the investigational product.  
This includes the following:  
• AEs not previously observed in the patient  that emerge during the protocol spec ified AE 
reporting period, including signs or symptoms associated with SC C that were not present 
prior to the AE reporting period.  
• Complications that occur as a result of protocol -mandated interventions (e.g.,  invasive 
procedures such as biopsies).  
• Preexis ting medical conditions (other than the condition being studied) judged by [CONTACT_13655]- specified AE reporting period.  
• Clinical progression of SC C should not be repor ted as an AE.

Confident ial Information

12.1.2  Serious Adverse Events  
An AE should be classified as an SAE if:  
• It results in death (i.e., the AE actually causes or leads to death).  
• It is life threatening (i.e.,  the AE, in the view of the investigator, places the patient  at 
immediate risk  of death.  It does not include an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe 
form, might have caused death.).  
• It requires or prolongs in patient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
• It results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e., the AE results in 
substant ial disruption of the patient ’s ability to conduct normal life functions).  
• It results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a mother exposed to the investigational product.  
• It is considered a significant medical event by [CONTACT_188212] (e.g., may jeopardize the patient  or may require medical/surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed above).  
 
All AEs that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded as non -serious AEs.  
The terms “severe” and “serious” are not synonymous.  Severity (or intensity) refers to the grade 
of a specific AE, e.g., mild (Grade 1), moderate (Grade 2), or severe (Grade 3) myocardial 
infarction. “Serious” is a regulatory definition (see previous def inition) and is based on patient  or 
event outcome or action criteria usually associated with events that pose a threat to a patient’s  
life or functioning.  Seriousness (not severity) serves as the guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations from th e Sponsor to applicable regulatory authorities.  
Severity and seriousness should be independently assessed when recording AEs and SAEs into 
the EDC system . 
12.2 Methods and Timing for Assessing and Recording Safety Variables  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all AEs and SAEs that are observed or reported during the study are collected and reported to the FDA, IRB, and Epi[INVESTIGATOR_761682], Inc. in accordance 
with CFR 312.32 (IND Safety reporting).  
12.2.[ADDRESS_1043072] administration of study treatment (RRx -001, 
cisplatin and radiation therapy) or study discontinuation/termination, whichever is earlier.  After  
this period, investigators should only report SAEs that are attributed to prior study treatment.  
12.2.2  Assessment of Adverse Events  
Investigators will assess the occurrence of AEs and SAEs at all patient  evaluation time points 
during the study.  All AEs and SAE s whether volunteered by [CONTACT_102] , discovered by [CONTACT_761714] 107,674/Serial No. [ADDRESS_1043073], or other 
means will be recorded in the patient’s  medical record and  into the EDC system . 
Each recorded AE or SAE will be described by [CONTACT_13662] (i.e.,  start and end dates), severity , 
regulatory seriousness criteria if applicable, suspected relationship to the investigational product 
(see following guidance), and actions taken.  
The AE grading (severity) scale f ound in the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI -CTCAE), Version 5.0 , will be used for AE reporting.  
Table 4: Adverse Event Grading (Severity) Scale  
Grade  Severity  Alternate Description a 
1 Mild (apply event -specific NCI -CTCAE 
grading criteria)  Transient or mild discomfort ( < 48 hours); no interference 
with the patient ’s daily activities; no medical 
intervention/therapy required  
2 Moderate (apply event -specific  
NCI-CTCAE grading criteria)  Mild to moderate interference with the patient ’s daily 
activities; no or minimal medical intervention/therapy 
required  
3 Severe (apply event -specific  
NCI-CTCAE grading criteria)  Considerable interference with the patient’s daily activities; medical interv ention/therapy required;

4 Very severe, life threatening,  
or disabling (apply event -specific 
NCI-CTCAE grading criteria)  Extreme limitation in activity; significant medical intervention/therapy required, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_114956]  
5 Death related to AE   
Note:  Regardless of severity, some events may also meet regulatory serious criteria.  Refer to definitions of an 
SAE  
aUse these alternative definitions for Grade 1, 2, 3, and 4 events when the observed or reported AE is not in th e 
NCI-CTCAE listing.  
 
To ensure consistency of AE and SAE causality assessments, investigators should apply the 
following general guideline:  
• YES  
There is a plausible temporal relationship between the onset of the AE and administration of the 
investigation al product  (RRx -001) , and the AE cannot be readily explained by [CONTACT_102] ’s 
clinical state, intercurrent illness, or concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; and/or the AE follows a known pattern of response to the investigational product  (RRx -001) ; and/or the AE abates o r resolves 
upon discontinuation  of the investigational product (RRx -001) or dose reduction and, if 
applicable, reappears upon re- challenge.  
• NO 
Evidence exists that the AE has an etiology other than the investigational product ( RRx-001) 
(e.g., preexisting medical condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, or concomitant 
medication); and/or the AE has no plausible temporal relationship to administration of the 
investigational product ( RRx-001) (e.g., cancer diagnosed [ADDRESS_1043074] dose of study  drug). 
IND 107,674/Serial No. [ADDRESS_1043075] medical terminology/concepts w hen 
reporting AEs or SAEs  and to a void co lloquialisms and abbreviations.  
a. Deaths  
All deaths that occur during the protocol -specified AE reporting period, regardless of attribution, 
will be reported to the appropriate parties.  When recording a death, the ev ent or condition that 
caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be reported as the single medical concept.  If 
the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of reporting, report 
“Unexplained Death”.  
b. Preexisting Medical Conditions 
A preexisting medical condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  Such conditions 
should be reported as medical and surgical history.  A preexisting medical condition should be 
re-assessed throughout the trial and reported as an AE or SAE only if the frequency, severity, or 
character of  the condition worsens during the study.  When reporting such events, it is important 
to convey the concept that the preexisting condition has changed by [CONTACT_13665] (e.g.,  “more frequent headaches”).  
c. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_38265].   If a patient  is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9615] a medical or surgical procedure as a 
result of an AE, the event responsible for the procedure, not the procedure itself, should be reported as the SAE.  For example, if a patient  is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_13587], record the heart condition that necessitated the by[CONTACT_13664].

whether accidental, therapeutic, or spontaneous, should always be classified as serious, and 
expeditiously reported as an SAE.  Similarly, any congenital anomaly/birth defect in a child born 
to a female patient  exposed to the investigational product should be reported as an SAE.  
e. Post-Study Adverse Events  
The investigato r should expeditiously report any SAE occurring after a patient  has completed or 
discontinued study participation if attributed to prior investigational product exposure.  If the 
investigator should become aware of the development of cancer or a congenital  anomaly in a 
subsequently conceived offspring of a female patient  who participated in the study, this should 
be reported as an SAE.  
12.3 Reporting Requirements for Adverse Events  
12.3.1  Expedited Reporting Requirements for Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs are required  to be reported to the Sponsor on the SAE CRF within 24 hours of a site’s

calculated as the number of days from the onset of SOM (first time a WHO grade 3 or 4 is observed) to the day when severe OM has resolved (first time WHO grade [ADDRESS_1043080] WHO grade 3 or 4). Durations of [ADDRESS_1043081] do es not depend on 
normality assumptions for these small sample sizes.  All patients randomized (the intent -to-treat 
population) will be used for this analysis.  
Time to onset of SOM:  The number of days from the start of chemotherapy until the date of 
first OM assessment grade 3 or 4 will be listed and summarized descriptively  for each treatment 
group.    
Incidence of SOM: The incidence of SOM (WHO grade 3 or 4) will be calculated as the number 
of patient s with at least one OM WHO grade [ADDRESS_1043082] severe scores.  The incidence of SOM will be compared between each RRx -001 group and 
the control arm using Fisher’s Exa ct test.  Clopper- Pearson two -sided 95% confidence limits will 
be calculated for the proportion of patient s with SOM in each treatment arm.

Duration and incidence of ulcerative OM:  The duration of ulcerative OM (WHO grade 2, 3, 
and 4) will be calculated  in a manner similar to duration of severe OM.   That is, the duration of 
ulcerative OM will be calculated as the number of days from the onset of ulcerative OM (first 
time a WHO grade 2, 3, or 4 is observed) to the day when ulcerative OM has resolved (firs t time 
WHO grade [ADDRESS_1043083] WHO grade 2, 3 or 4).  A similar imputation scheme 
will be used in the event that patient s die or withdraw prior to resolution of OM to grade 0 or 1. 
The Wilcoxon rank -sum tests will be used to compare treatme nt groups. I ncidence of ulcerative 
OM will be calculated and analyzed as described above for severe OM.  
Patient -reported pain:  The average of patient -reported mouth and throat soreness (MTS) 
scores, graded on a scale from 0 (no soreness) to 4 (extreme soreness), will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_761715].   The number of patients with 
scores of 0 or 1 will be enumerated by [CONTACT_404993].  
13.3 Safety Analysis  
Safety will be evaluated on the basis of treatmen t-emergent AEs (TEAEs), vital signs, weight, 
physical examinations, tumor assessments, and clinical laboratory assessments.  
All adverse events will be coded by [CONTACT_761716].   The National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE) (Version 5.0 ) will be used to grade both clinical and laboratory AEs. 
By-patient listings of deaths, SAEs, and AEs leading to discontinuation will be provided.  The 
by-patient AE data lis tings will include onset and resolution dates, verbatim term, Preferred 
Term, treatment, severity (grade), relationship to treatment, action taken for the event, and 
outcome.  
The incidence of treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) will be summarized by [CONTACT_3148] g roup and 
tabulated by [CONTACT_1196] (SOC) and Preferred Term (PT).  A TEAE is defined as an AE 
that first occurs or worsens in severity on or after the first dose of the study medication .  
Vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse, and  temperature) and body weight will 
be summarized for each treatment group using descriptive statistics.  Summary statistics (n, 
mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum) will be calculated for both the 
actual value and the change from baseline value at each scheduled visit.  
Clinical laboratory data will be presented for each treatment group using descriptive statistics 
based on the observed values and change from baseline values at each scheduled visit.  Summary 
statistics (n, mean, median, SD , minimum, and maximum) will be calculated for quantitative 
safety data and frequency counts will be compi[INVESTIGATOR_10140].   
Shift tables from baseline to the worst post -baseline values during the treatment period will be 
provided for chemistry parameters and hematology parameters that have NCI -CTCAE v5.[ADDRESS_1043084] baseline values during the treatment 
period will be considered.  Additionally, the number and percentage of patient s with Grade ≥  [ADDRESS_1043085].

All clinical laboratory data will be listed by [CONTACT_4676] . Values outside the normal ranges will be 
flagged and toxicity grades will be displayed for relevant parameters.  
Pre-study abno rmalities and reported abnormalities at the end of study will be tabulated by [CONTACT_110377].  Changes in physical examinations will be described in the text of the final study report.  
Tumor response assessments at each follow -up visit will be tabulated by [CONTACT_1570].  
Prior and concomitant medications will be tabulated for each treatment group; details regarding 
dose regimens and start/stop dates will be presented in by -patient  data listings.  
Progression Free Survival  (PFS) defined from the time of r egist ration to the time of the first 
radiographic documentation of objective progression  (per RECIST v1.1 ) or the date of death, 
whichever is earlier, will be evaluated using Kaplan -Meier methods. Subjects still alive without 
progressive disease at the time of analysis will be censored on the date of the last objective 
progression -free observation prior to the start of subsequent anti -cancer therapy.

Dear Patient,  
 
Thank you for partici pating in this trial.  To help minimize your risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_761704] -
related issues during and after radiation therapy, you’ll receive an oral hygiene kit containing a soft toothbrush  (AIM) , a standard fluoride -containing toothpaste  gel (PRO -SYS Flo uride 
Toothgel) , xylitol -containing chewing gum  (Epic) , 0.4% stannous fluoride gel  (ESPE OMNI 
Gel), flossers (DenTek) and a fluoride mouthrinse  (CloSYS) . Here are some instructions on how 
best to use them and some strategies to keep your mouth comfortable and healthy.  
1. Keep your mouth moist  
a. Drink plenty of water.  
b. Suck ice chips.  
c. Use a saliva substitute to help moisten your mouth.  
 
2. Clean your mouth, tongue, and gums  
a. Use the soft toothbrush provided in the oral hygiene kit or an electric toothbrush.  Brush 
your teeth and tongue after every meal using the fluoride toothpaste.  
b. Chew the sugarless gum after meals.  
c. At bedtime brush your teeth with the 0.4% stannous fluoride gel  (ESPE OMNI Gel) .  
d. Rinse twice daily with the fluoride -containing mouthwash such (CloSYS) . 
e. Floss your teeth gently every day. If your gums bleed and hurt, avoid the areas that are 
bleeding or sore, but keep flossing your other teeth.  
 
3. If your mouth is sore, watch what you eat and drink  
a. Choose foods that are good for you and easy to chew and swal low. 
b. Take small bites of food, chew slowly, and sip liquids with your meals.  
c. Eat moist, soft foods such as cooked cereals, mashed potatoes, and scrambled eggs.  
d. If you have trouble swallowing, soften your food with gravy, sauces, broth, yogurt, or 
other liq uids.  
 
4. Remember to stay away from  
a. Sharp, crunchy foods, like taco chips, that could scrape or cut your mouth.  
b. Spi[INVESTIGATOR_761705], like citrus fruits and juices, which may irritate your mouth.  
c. Sugary foods and drinks, like candy or soda, that could cause  cavities.  
d. Toothpi[INVESTIGATOR_103483], because they may cut your mouth.  
e. Tobacco and alcohol products.

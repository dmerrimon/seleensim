4. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
Post-surgical wound care is imperative  to pro mote rapid healing without complications. The key 
principle of wound management is to  create an occlusive, clean, and moist environment at the 
wound site to reduce the possibility of infection and facilitate the wound healing phases.1 Two (2) 
common  topi[INVESTIGATOR_804961]-the-
counter (OTC)  petrolatum -based ointment s. While b oth methods have comparable wound-
healing properties, topi[INVESTIGATOR_804962] .2-4 For this,  dermatologists often opt for  petrolatum -based ointment  
application for wound healing.    
Cetaphil® Healing Ointment (Galderma, Fort  Worth, TX) is an OTC skin protectant that contains 
71.5% petrolatum , shea butter to soften, smooth and hydrate, as well as vitamin E to help support 
moisture barrier function.  The Healing Ointment  has been clinically proven to hydrate the skin’s 
natural barrier for [ADDRESS_1111217] is also hypoallergenic, non- comedogenic, gentle on sensitive 
skin and accepted by [CONTACT_804972]. These beneficial properties make 
Cetaphil® Healing Ointment  an ideal candidate as a post -surgical wound care. Th is study is to 
investigate safety and eff icacy of C etaphil® Healing Ointment  in wound healing after dermatologic 
procedures.

11. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
A descriptive statistical summary will be p rovided for clinical grading and tolerability 
assessments . The descriptive summery will be performed for each parameter,  including N , 
mean, median, standard deviations, minimum, and maximum of values at all applicable time 
points.   
Mean of the change from baseline (pre-procedure)  will be estimated at applicable post -baseline 
time point. The null hypothesis, that the mean change from  baseline  (pre-procedure)  is zero, will 
be tested using methods described in the Statistical Analysis Plan table. 
The following will be calculated and reported for each evaluation parameter at  applicable post -
baseline (pre-procedure)  time point:  
Percent mean change from baseline =  
(postprocedure  or visit  mean score  – baseline preprocedure mean score )
baseline preprocedure  mean score x 100  
Percent of subjects  i mproved/worsened =  
(number  of subjects  improved /worsened  from  baseline preprocedure)
total number  of subjects x 100  
Questionnaires will be tabulated, and the percentage of all response options  (favorable and 
unfavorable)  will be reported for each question and each timepoint.  
Statistical Analysis Plan  
Evaluation  Change from Baseline Pre -
Procedure  Notes/Interpretation  
Clinical grading  Paired t -test; If normality fails, a 
Wilcoxon signed -rank test will be 
used.  A decrease in scores indicates 
an improvement  
Tolerability assessment  Paired t -test; If normality fails, a 
Wilcoxon signed -rank test will be 
used.  A decrease in scores or lack of 
significant increase indicates 
tolerability/safety of the

Throughout the course of the study, all adverse events will be monitored and reported on an 
adverse event CRF/ eCRF without omitting any requested and known information. When AEs 
occur, the main concern is the safety of the study subjects . At time of the informed consent 
signature, each subject must be given the name [CONTACT_357588].  
At each visit, after the subject has had the opportunity to spontaneously mention any problems, 
the investigator  should inquire about AEs by [CONTACT_243932]:  
  Page 18 of 29 
Protocol GLI.04. US.SL .017 CONFIDENTIAL  
Protocol Version 1:  
This document contains confidential, proprietary information.  
• “Have you had any health problems since your last study visit?”  
• “Have there been any changes in the medicines you take since your last study visit?”  
AEs should be reported for any clinically relevant change, as determined by [CONTACT_941] I nvestigator , in 
concomitant medication(s) that is the result of an untoward (unfavorable and unintended) 
change from baseline in a subject's medical health following exposure to the study treatment.  
Changes from baseline in any protocol -specific parameter evaluated during the study are to be 
reviewed by [CONTACT_941] I nvestigator . In addition, the subject’s responses to any questionnaire utilized 
during the study are to be reviewed by [CONTACT_093] . Any untoward (unf avorable and 
unintended) change from baseline in a protocol -specific parameter or question response that is 
clinically relevant, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871] , is to be reported as an AE. These clinically 
relevant changes will be reported regardless of causality. 
12.1 Definitions  
12.1.1.  Adverse Events (AE)  
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject taking part in 
the clinical study, and which does not necessarily require a causal relationship with the 
investigational product and/or a clinical trial procedure.  
An AE can be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory value), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of the investigational product, whether 
or not related to this product.  
When an AE has a likely or very likely causal relationship with the investigational product and/or 
a clinical trial procedure, it is named undesirable effect or related AE (see Section 3).  
12.1.2.  Local tolerability signs and symptoms (only applicable for cosmetic safety studies) 
In cosmetic studies, local skin tolerability includes some expected functional and/or physical 
signs on the application area, observed by [CONTACT_357578] (see 
Appendix). Those signs are collected in the final report based on scales or a diary. If the sever ity of a local skin tolerability sign or symptom, is such that the product application is 
permanently discontinued and/or a corrective concomitant treatment (except moisturizer or emollient) is prescribed, it is recorded as an undesirable effect (related A E). 
12.1.3.  Serious Adverse Events (SAE)  and serious undesirable effect/related SAE  
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any adverse event which results in death, is life -threatening, 
requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], results in persistent 
or significant disability/incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
Notes:  
The term “immediate vital risk” refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the 
time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it was more severe.  
  Page 19 of 29 
Protocol GLI.04. US.SL .017 CONFIDENTIAL  
Protocol Version 1:  
This document contains confidential, proprietary information.  
Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_77231] a night 
at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_357562] a diagnostic test (even if related to an 
AE), elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_357563], admission to a day -care facility, social admission (e.g., if the subject has no 
place to sleep), or administrative admission (e.g., for a yearly examination) should not be 
considered as a SAE.  
A serious undesirable effect/related SAE is defined as any SAE which the Investigator classifies as having a reasonable possibility for a causal relationship with the investigational product 
and/or the clinical trial procedure.  
12.2 Severity Assessment  
For all AEs occurring during the clinical trial, the Investigator is to classify and report the intensity 
of AEs using the following definitions as a guideline:  
- Mild: awareness of signs and symptoms, but easily tolerated  
- Moderate: discomfort, enough to cause interference with usual activity  
- Severe: incapacitating, with inability to work or perform usual activity.  
12.3 Causality Assessment  
The Investigator is to assess the causal relationship (causality) between an adverse event and 
the investigational product and/or the clinical trial procedure according to the following definitions 
(Decision of 25 November 2013 on Guideline on Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009 
(2013/674/EU) - Causality assessment of undesirable effect caused by [CONTACT_357579]):  
• Very likely  
• Likely  
• Not clearly attributable  
• Unlikely  
• Excluded 
Medical judgment should be used to determine the relationship, considering all relevant factors 
including the pattern of reaction, temporal relationships, positive de -challenge or re -challenge, 
relevant medical history, and confounding factors such as co -medication or concurrent diseases.  
12.4 Collection, M anagement and Reporting Procedures 
The period of collection of adverse events starts from the time of signature [CONTACT_357589] (ICF) by [CONTACT_423] (and/or, for subjects who are minor, by [CONTACT_7903]/legal 
representatives)  until the end of the subject’s participation in the clinical study.  
If a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is on -going at the final clinical trial visit, it should be followed by 
[CONTACT_357580] a stable condition.  
After the subject completes the clinical study, the Investigator should als o inform the Sponsor 
(see Sponsor’s contact [CONTACT_2212]) if he/she becomes aware of an SAE involving a subject 
who has participated in the clinical study.  
At each post -enrollment visit, the Investigator will question the subject about AEs using an open 
non-persuasive question to elicit reporting of AEs, for example “ Have you noticed any change in 
your health since the last visit? ” Direct questioning and examination will be performed when 
appropriate.  
  Page 20 of 29 
Protocol GLI.04. US.SL .017 CONFIDENTIAL  
Protocol Version 1:  
This document contains confidential, proprietary information.  
The Investigator will obtain and maintain in the subject’s files all pertinent medical records, and (if 
applicable) information and medical judgment from colleagues who assisted in the treatment and 
follow- up of the subject.  If necessary, the Investigator will contact [CONTACT_423]’s personal physician 
or hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_99391].  
As a minimum, Investigators are requested to report in the Case Report Form (CRF) and in the report all related adverse events (i.e. undesirable effects) and all Serious Adverse 
Events, whether related or not.  
12.4.1.  Management and reporting procedures for undesirable effects (i.e. related adverse 
events  
Undesirable effects should be recorded in the CRF and summarized in the report in a summary table with at minimum the subject number, AE number, AE diagnosis or signs and symptoms, location, date of onset, seriousness, severity, action taken, relationship, date of resolution and 
concomitant treatment associated as well as a detailed narrative of the event. 
In addition, based on his/her medical judgment, the Investigator will assess whether an 
undesirable effect requires immediate (i.e. within 24 hours) reporting to the Sponsor. In such 
cases, the summary table will be sent to the Sponsor, along with the AE narrative and any other relevant information (concomitant t reatments, product weighing, …).  
All undesirable effects should be appropriately documented, i.e. any relevant information such as demographics, medical history and concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_357564].  
The Investigator is to monitor and record the progress of the adverse effect until the last subject’s study visit.  
The Investigator is to update the AE narrative as appropriate, each time follow -up information is 
collected and when the final outcome of the adverse effect is known. 
12.4.2.  Management and reporting procedures for Serious Adverse Events  
The Investigator is to take the following steps:  
1. Take prompt and appropriate medical action, if necessary. The safety of clinical trial 
subjects is the first priority  
2. Ensure the AE is classified as an SAE. Immediately inform the Sponsor’s representative of the event by [CONTACT_71345] (see contact [CONTACT_2212]) and discuss further actions to be 
taken:  
e-mail: [EMAIL_6387]
 
3. Complete the Serious Adverse Event (SAE) form provided by [CONTACT_1034]’s representative Within 24 hours, fax or send by e- mail to the Sponsor’s representative  
the completed SAE form, accompanied any other relevant information (e.g. test results or medi cal records).  
4. Monitor, record and send to Sponsor’s representative the progress of the event until it resolves or reaches a stable outcome, with or without sequelae (send the updated SAE 
form with follow- up information and any other relevant information to Sponsor’s 
representative).  
5. Obtain and maintain in the subject’s file all pertinent medical records, information, and medical judgments from colleagues who assisted in the treatment and follow -up of the

subject. If necessary, contact [CONTACT_423]’s personal physician or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_298423].  
6. If applicable, comply with the regulatory requirement(s) related to the reporting of SAEs to the Institutional Review Board (IRB) / Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) . 
12.[ADDRESS_1111236] should be 
withdrawn from the clinical study and Sponsor’s representative (see Sponsor’s contact [CONTACT_357581]) should be informed within [ADDRESS_1111237] be recorded as a reason for discontinuation in the exit form of the CRF.  
No specific follow- up of pregnancy is required, except if it is a regulatory requirement in the 
country(ies) where the clinical trial is conducted.  
12.6 Process for Suspected Allergic Reactions  
In case of a positive reaction (suspi[INVESTIGATOR_804965]) in the clinical study, the Investigator will inform  
the Sponsor if the reaction occurs with the Sponsor’s company product(s) following the procedure 
below. The Investigator will also inform if products other than the Sponsor’s product(s) were 
concomitantly tested in the clinical trial, and if there were pos itive reaction(s) for these other 
products.  
 Stop the investigational product . 
 Take a pi[INVESTIGATOR_804966].  
 Report the event by [CONTACT_49907] 24 hours to the Sponsor’s representative (see Sponsor’s 
contact [CONTACT_73322]). The Sponsor will then contact [CONTACT_804977].  
 Follow the procedure detailed below:  
1. After all signs and symptoms of the event have resolved and after a minimum of at least two weeks from last dose application perform a re- challenge test with the 
assigned study product  
2. Ensure the subject has not been under any treatment with corticosteroids or 
antihistaminics within the week before testing  
3. Ensure that the sk in on the back has not been irradiated by [CONTACT_804978]  
4. Apply an appropriate quantity of the study product to fill in the cupule of the test 
chamber and then to the upper part of the back skin (or the inner forearm if more 
appropriate) either at right or left from the central line. If no test chamber is available on site, patch test units will be provided by [CONTACT_1034]. The use of semi -occlusive 
conditions can be preferred depending on the irritant  potential of the study product 
and the intensity of the reaction which was reported. The method to be used should be discussed with the Sponsor.  
Choose a skin site that was not previously involved in the inflammatory skin reaction. Cover 
it for [ADDRESS_1111238] 
system dry

6. After 48 hours, remove the tests and evaluate the site reactions:  
 [ADDRESS_1111239] removal (1st reading),  
 48 hours after pat ch removal (2nd reading).    
 72 or 96 hours after patch removal (3rd reading).  
 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_804967]  
 
7. Use the following scoring system (International Contact [CONTACT_173867]) 
at each reading:   
 
Score  Morphology  Interpretation  
- No reaction  Negative  
? Erythema only, no infiltration  Doubtful reaction  
+ Erythema, infiltration, possibly 
discrete papules  Weak positive reaction  
++ Erythema, infiltration, papules, 
vesicles Strong positive reaction  
+++ Erythema, infiltration, confluent 
vesicles, bullae Extreme positive reaction  
ir  Inflammation sharply limited to the 
exposed area, lack of infiltrate, small petechiae, pustules, and 
efflorescences other than papules 
and vesicles  Irritant reaction  
Nt  Not tested  
 
8. At last reading, the investigator will provide an assessment regarding a possible 
sensitization reaction using the following scale:  
 
Sensitization Reaction  
0 Negative (absence of reaction or might be irritative reaction)  
1 Equivocal  
2 Positive

This document contains confidential, proprietary information.  
9. Report the results from the re- challenge test as directed by [CONTACT_804979].  
10. In case of absence of reaction after quotation with the ICDRG scale, the subject may 
resume product application, if appropriate.  
11. After quotation with the ICDRG scale, if the re -challenge is positive, equivocal or in 
favour of an irritation, notify the Sponsor immediately. Except specific situations, a new 
series of patch test will be initiated as directed by [CONTACT_1034] (with individual 
ingredients at different concentrations and possibly negative and positive controls ) 
after a minimum of additional two weeks (but not later than 6 months) and after all 
signs and symptoms have resolved.  The patch tests will be placed on a back skin site 
(or the inner forearm if more appropriate) distant from the site of re -challenge tes t (e.g. 
at the left upper back skin if the re -challenge test was done on the right). Follow the 
same procedure for the patch test as for the re- challenge.

Inclusion criteria for analyses 1, 3, 4:  
• 365 days enrollment in Medicare Parts A, B, and D with no HMO coverage prior to index date  
• No use of tofacitinib or abatacept any time prior to index date (all available lookback approach with a minimum 
of 365 days)  
• No diagnosis of dementia any time prior to and including index date  
• At least one inpatient  or one outpatient claim  with rheumatoid arthritis diagnosis recorded in 365 days prior to 
and including index date  
• No history of nursing home admission recorded in 365 days prior to and including ind ex date  
 
Inclusion criteria for analysis 2:  
• 365 days enrollment in Medicare Parts A, B, and D with no HMO coverage prior to index date  
• No use of tofacitinib or abatacept any time prior to index date (all available lookback approach with a minimum 
of 365 da ys) 
• No diagnosis of dementia any time prior to and including index date  
• At least one inpatient  or one outpatient claim  with rheumatoid arthritis diagnosis recorded in 365 days prior to 
and including index date  
• 180-day continuous use of tofacitinib or abata cept starting on the index date  
• No history of nursing home admission recorded in 365 days prior to and including index date

c. Outcome variables  and study follow -up:  
 
• Primary outcome : incident dementia,  i.e., Alzheimer’s disease, vascular dementia, senile, presenile, or 
unspecified dementia, or dementia in other diseases classified elsew here. Outcome will be defined by 1 inpatient 
claim or 2 outpatient claims  in analysis 1, 2, 3 . In analysis 4, the outcome will be defined by 1 inpatient or 1 
outpatient claims and 1 prescription claim  for a symptomatic treatment [donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine, and 
memantine ] within 6 months  of each other with outcome date assigned to second event in the sequence .  
• Secondary outcomes: I ndividual componen t: 
Alzheimer’s disease  
 
Condition  ICD-9 and ICD -10 codes  
Alzheimer’s disease  331.0*, F00*, G30*  
Vascular dementia  290.4*, F01*

 10 8. Propensity score  analysis   
We will use a propensity -score (PS) 1-based approach to account for measured confounding in this study. The PS will 
be calculated as the predicted probability of initiating the exposure of interest (i.e., the repurposing cand idate) versus 
the reference drug conditional on baseline covariates using multivariable logistic regression constructed separately 
in each data source. On average, patients with similar PSs have similar distribution of potential confounders used to 
estimat e the PS. Therefore, analyses conditioned on the PS provide effect estimates that are free from measured 
confounding. For all our analyses, initiators of each exposure of interest will be matched with initiators of the reference 
exposure based on their PS within each data source. [ADDRESS_905430], the PS distributional overlap  is provided  between 
two groups  before and  after matching  to ensure comparability of these groups. 5 Next, balance in each individual 
covariate between two treatment groups is reported using standar dized differences. 6

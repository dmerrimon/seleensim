Summary:
Evaluability
All subjects enrolled in the study will be considered evaluable for the safety analysis.  
Analysis
The primary objective is to estimate the annualized endothelial  cell loss rate (for up to 10 
years following date of implantation) of subjects previously im planted with the AcrySof®
CACHET®Phakic Lens (L-Series) from clinical studies C-02-23, C-02-40, C -03-[ADDRESS_516232] additional safety data th at may identify risk factors for 
eyes with significant endothelial cell loss.

Study Phase:  Not applicable – Study is observational only
Test Article(s) / Product(s): AcrySof®CACHET®Phakic Lens (L-Series)
Study Dosage / Usage: Intraocular lenses are implantable medical devices and

Objective(s): The primary objective is to estimate the annualized 
endothelial cell loss rate (for up to 10 years following date of implantation) of subjects previously implantedwith the AcrySof
®CACHET®Phakic Lens (L-Series) 
from clinical studies C-02-23, C-02-40, C-03-[ADDRESS_516233] additional safety data that may identify risk factors for eyes with significant endothelial cell loss.
Study Population: Subjects previously implanted with the AcrySof®
CACHET®Phakic Lens (L-series) in clinical studies 
C-02-23, C-02-40, C-03-21 and C-05-57 (includes subjects who have had the lens explanted for any reason).

and the next available visit listed here to enable continued ye arly examination. As in previous studies, subjects with the Acr ySof®CACHET®Phakic Lens (L-
Series) implanted in both eyes will have separate study visits, as needed, for each eye to capture the data within the window of the annual implant date anniversary.

the average cell density of the analyzable images for an individ ual eye for each corneal 
location (central ) will be used in all summary a nalyses.
4.1.2.   ENDOTHELIAL CELL LOSS OVER TIME (CHRONIC )
Chronic endothelial cell loss is defined as loss from the Day 1 47-182 (Form 5 or 5A) visit (in 
the previous studies) to any subsequent visit.
[IP_ADDRESS]. C HRONIC CHANGE FROM DAY 147-182 (M ONTH 6IN PREVIOUS STUDIES )
Descriptive statistics will be provided for each scheduled visit, for  central  
endothelial cell density, for all eyes combined.  The statistics  presented for endothelial cell 
density (using the average from the analyzable images for each eye) will include mean, 
median, standard deviation, sample size, minimum, and maximum.
The percent change of mean endothelial cell density over time f rom Day 147-182 (Form 5 or 
5A) in the previous studies to each visit in the current study will be calculated.  The actual and 
annualized percent change of mean endothelial cell density from  the Day 147-182 (Form 5 or 
5A) exam to each scheduled visit in this study will be calculated and presented along with 
median, standard deviation, sample size, minimum and maximum. Tab les presenting the 
mean, median, standard deviation, sample size, minimum and maximum of baseline (Form 5 or 5A in previous studies) endothelial cell density and cell de nsity change from baseline to

[IP_ADDRESS].   POSTOPERATIVE CHANGE FROM PREOPERATIVE BASELINE
Descriptive statistics will be provided for change from preoperative baseline (in previous 
studies) to each scheduled visit in this study, for  central  endothelial cell 
density, for all eyes combined.  The statistics presented will include mean, median, standard 
deviation, sample size, minimum and maximum. The percent change o f mean endothelial cell 
density from preoperative baseline (Form [ADDRESS_516237] udy) to each scheduled 
postoperative visit (both in previous studies and this study) w ill be calculated to determine 
subjects who had ≥30% loss. A table showing the number and percent of eyes which had the onset of ≥30% endothelial cell loss (central ) from the preoperative level or 
central  of ≤1500 endothelial cells/mm
2(occurring 6 months or later 
following implantation) will be presented. 
In addition, the mean actual and annualized percent change of e ndothelial cell density (using 
the average from the analyzable images for each eye) of all subjects from baseline to each 
visit will be calculated and presented along with median, stand ard deviation, sample size, 
minimum and maximum.  These tables will be presented for all eyes combined.Alcon - Business Use Only Effective Date:

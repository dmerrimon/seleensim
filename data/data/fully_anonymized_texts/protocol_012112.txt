VICC BMT1651 Protocol v 7: 2020DEC09  Page [ADDRESS_1168429] -allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant outcomes for lymphoma using 
ibrutinib  
Background Given the emergence of non -hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT)  options for this patient 
population, and the relatively high risk of non- relapse mortality (NRM) associated with 
HCT, only patients with advanced disease (and thus at a high risk for post HCT relapse) 
are typi[INVESTIGATOR_841013]. HCT has become increasingly safe, but relapse post 
HCT and immune mediated disorders after HCT (viz. graft -versus- host disease, GVHD) 
remain the main obstacles to successful outcome. Maintaining control of the neoplasm in 
the early post HCT period until GVT is established should lead to improved outcomes.

2. INTRODUCTION  
 
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) represent the heterogeneity of B-cell Non -Hodgkin lymphoma, with varying natural histories and pathobiology . Interestingly, targeting 
the B -cell receptor signaling pathway using ibrutinib, a Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor, favorably 
impacts both of these diseases
1-6. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_841014] i mmunotherapeutic 
approaches , an allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) is the only curative option7-11. This is 
primarily mediated by [CONTACT_167302] -versus- tumor (GVT) effect12-14. Given the  emergence of non- HCT options for 
this patient population, and the relatively high risk of non- relapse mortality (NRM) associated with HCT, 
VICC BMT1651 Protocol v 7: 2020DEC09  Page 7 of 107 only patients with advanced disease (and thus at a high risk for post HCT relapse)  are typi[INVESTIGATOR_841015]. HCT has become increasingly safe, but relapse post HCT and immune mediated 
disorders after HCT (viz. graft -versus- host disease, GVHD) remain the main obstacles to successful 
outcome. Maintaining control of the neoplasm in the early post HCT period until GVT is established 
should lead to improved outcomes. Use of conventional cytotoxic agents is not practical in the early 
post HCT period.  
 
We propose the following primary objective : to study the use of ibrutin ib starting between day [ADDRESS_1168449] to improve the progression- free survival (PFS) at [ADDRESS_1168450] by 25% compared to historical controls in patients with of CLL and MCL (cohort A).  
 
GVHD is a complex immune phenomenon that is classically defined as acute and chronic and 
affects a variety of organ systems . The initial 
phase of GV HD is primarily T cell mediated . 
Figure 1 shows the various roles of the normal B 
cell. Adequate pre- clinical and clinical data shows 
that B -cell dysfunction contributes  to chronic 
GVHD
15-20 .  Pre-clinic al data shows  that part of 
this dysfunction is due to hyper -responsiveness of 
the B -cell receptor (BCR), which can be 
abrogated by [CONTACT_841043]21. Thus, it is conceivable that using 
ibrutinib post HCT may not only lead to effective 
tumor control but down modulate GVHD.  Based 
on these data, ibrutinib was studied as a single 
agent for established chronic GVHD 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) and approved for chronic GVHD after failure of one or more lines of systemic ther apy. 
It is likely that the effect on GVHD may be prevalent in patients with other lymphomas as well.  
 Thus, in the 
secondary objective:  we propose to study the safety, tolerability and impact on acute and 
chronic GVHD. This aim will encompass diagnoses other than CLL and MCL and will include follicular 
center cell lymphoma ( FL) and Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) (Cohort B).  
 
3. PRIMARY OBJECTIVE  
 
To study the use of ibrutinib starting between day [ADDRESS_1168451] by 25% compared to historical controls. The 
sample size is designed to address this primary endpoint .

5.[ADDRESS_1168462] -in-class, potent, orally administered covalently -binding inhibitor of Bruton’s  
tyrosine kinase ( BTK). Inhibition of BTK blocks downstream BCR signaling pathways and thus  
VICC BMT1651 Protocol v 7: 2020DEC09  Page 9 of 107 prevents B -cell proliferation. In vitro, ibrutinib inhibits purif ied BTK and selected members of the  
kinase family with 10 -fold specificity compared with non -
BTK kinases. The phosphorylation and activation of BTK by 
[CONTACT_841046] (e .g.: LYN, SYK) leads to PLCγ2 
phosphorylation, calcium mobilization and activation of 
downstream pathways ( AKT, MAP  kinase, NFkB) that leads 
to changes that promote cell differentiation, proliferation and 
survival22;23. Ibrutinib covalently binds to a cystei ne residue 
in the BTK active sit e and irreversibly inhibits BCR signaling 
downstream of BTK. In vivo, ibrutinib reduces the 
phosphorylation of BTK, PLC γ2, AKT, and ERK 
pathways24.  Similar effects were observed in vitro in MCL 
cells. NFkB downregulation was not 
limited to peripheral blood but was also 
noted in bone marrow and lymph nodes . 
BTK is a member of the Tec kinase 
family that transmits signals from various cell surface receptors most prominently from the BCR. BTK plays a role in the intermediate stages of BCR signaling cascade and is 
commonly overexpressed in MCL and CLL
25.  Ibrutinib (IMBRUVICA™) is approved by [CONTACT_941] U.S. Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or 
mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) who have received at least one prior therapy and in CLL patient s with del

approved for chronic GVHD after failure of one or more lines of systemic therapy.  Patients undergoing 
HCT remain at a high risk of relapse post -HCT. Continued post -HCT treatment may be of benefit until 
GVT has had a chance to eliminate the neoplasm. Thus, patients on the proposed study will start 
ibrutinib post -HCT, to see if post -HCT use can decrease the risk of relapse or progression.  For the 
most comprehensive nonclinical and clinical information regarding ibrutinib background, s afety, 
efficacy, and in vitro and in vivo preclinical activity and toxicology of ibrutinib, refer to the latest version of the ibrutinib USPI.

kinase ( BTK) and may be a more potent B cell malignancy drug than rituximab
4;26. BTK is a critical 
intermediate in BCR signaling 27. It is a non- receptor tyrosine kinase belonging to the Tec family of 
kinases (TFKs), and critical for B cell processes effected by [CONTACT_488260]27. Individuals who lack functioning 
BTK lack circulating B cells and are unable to produce immunoglobulins or mount humoral immune 
responses28. BCR ligation leads to BTK activation which subsequently phosphorylates phospholipase 
Cγ2 (PLCγ2) triggering a series of downstream events including transcriptional regulation involving NF-κB and NFAT
27.BTK appears to regulate B cell survival by [CONTACT_841047]- R signaling29. Ibrutinib is also an irreversible inhibitor of interleukin-
2 inducible kinase (ITK). ITK is involved in proximal T- cell receptor (TCR) sig naling which activates the 
signaling cascade that includes NFAT, NFkB, and MAPK pathways resulting in T cell activation. ITK has a dominant role in the activation of Th2 cells, but not in Th1 cells.  
 GVHD is a complex immune phenomenon that is classically defined as acute and chronic and affects a Figure 2:  Outcome of 46 patients with CLL/MCL after first HCT at 
Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Cumulative incidence of failure by 
[ADDRESS_1168464] (defined as requirement of second line therapy of acute 
GVHD, development of NIH moderate to severe chronic GVHD, death 
due to relapse/progression, death due to non -relapse causes) was 50%.

various roles of the normal B cell. Adequate pre- clinical and clinical data shows that B- cell dysfunction 
contri butes to chronic GVHD15;17;19;30;31.  Pre -clinic al data shows that part of this dysfunction is due to 
hyper -responsiveness of the B- cell receptor (BCR), which can be abrogated by [CONTACT_841048]21.  
Thus, it is conceivable that using ibrutinib post HCT, may not only lead to effective tumor control but 
may down modulate GVHD  as well.  Ibrutinib was studied as a single agent for established chronic

[STUDY_ID_REMOVED] investigated the role of single agent ibrutinib in patients post HCT for established 
steroid– refractory or dependent chronic GVHD, and a dose of [ADDRESS_1168474] was 27 months (range, 8- 115). Best overall response rate 
(ORR) was 87.5% and was consistent with results observed in the overall /broader population. The 
authors concluded that Ibrutinib was well tolerated in patients who had prior HCT, with a safety profile 
similar to that observed in the overall R/R CLL population. They also presented a case showing a 
patient who achieved donor chimerism (i.e. full acceptance of the donor B Cells) following ibrutinib treatment, achieved MRD -ve disease and then interrupted  for [ADDRESS_1168475] who were treated with Ibrutinib. All 
patients responded and 2 patients (11q and 17p) have returned to MRD negative status . Three patient s 
VICC BMT1651 Protocol v 7: 2020DEC09  Page [ADDRESS_1168476] achieved donor chimerism. In addition, there was symptomatic improvement in oral and skin 
chronic GVHD37. 
 
To date, ibrutinib shows clinically meaningful efficacy  with a tolerable safety profile. For additional 
information, please see the text below, as well as the USPI [INVESTIGATOR_201664]’s Brochure.  
  
6.3 Drug I nformation 
 
6.3.1 Pharmacology  
 
Ibrutinib is a small -molecule inhibitor of BTK and ITK. Ibrutinib is a w hite to off -white solid, and its 
molecular formula is C25H24N6O2 and molecular weight is 440.50 g/mole Both tablet and capsule 
forms are available, and the results of bioequivalence studies may be found in the Investigator’s 
Brochure.  Ibrutinib forms a covalent bond with a cysteine residue (Cys-481) in the BTK active site, 
leading to inhibition of BTK enzymatic activity ; ibrutinib also binds irreversibly to the equivalent cysteine 
in the ITK pocket  BTK is a signaling molecule of the B- cell antigen receptor (BCR) and cytokine 
receptor pathways. BTK’s role in signaling through the B -cell surface receptors results in activation of 
pathways necessary for B- cell trafficking, chemotaxis, and adhesion. Nonclinical studies show that 
ibrutinib inhibits malignant B- cell proliferation and survival in vivo as well as cell migration and substrate 
adhesion in vitro  (refer to the current USPI  [INVESTIGATOR_201664]’s Brochure).  
 
Ibrutinib was designed as a selective and covalent inhibitor of BTK (Pan 2007). In vitro, ibrutinib is a 
potent inhibitor of BTK activity (IC50 = 0.39 nM). The irreversible binding of ibrutinib to cysteine- 481 in 
the active site of BTK results in sustained inhibition of BTK catalytic activity and enhanced selectivity 
over other kinases that do not contain a cysteine at this position. When added directly to human whole blood, ibrutinib inhibits signal transduction from the B -cell receptor and blocks primary B-cell activation 
(IC50 = 80 nM) as assayed by [CONTACT_14181] -IgM stimulation followed by [CONTACT_398]69 expression (Herman 2011).

6.3.3 Summary of Clinical Safety  Data  
 
As of 12 November 2019, ibrutinib has been studied as both a monotherapy and combination therapy in 
53 completed (primary or final analyses) and 17 ongoing company -sponsored studies, 9 early access 
programs (ongoing or completed), and  175 investigator -initiated studies (ongoing or completed). Safety 
data for completed studies is available for 4,439 subjects, of which, 2,132 were treated with ibrutinib monotherapy (1,600 subjects with hematologic malignancies, 42 subjects with cGVHD, 460 healthy 
VICC BMT1651 Protocol v 7: 2020DEC09  Page 13 of 107 volunteers, and 30 subjects in a hepatic impairment study).  Ibrutinib has been approved in 
approximately 100 countries for 1 or more indications.

ImmunoSeq Assays illuminate the adaptive immune system with controlled Multiplex PCR amplification 
and high throughput sequencing of T -cell receptors combined with sophisticated bioinformatics . 
 
8.3 CyTOF  
 
Although B cell dysfunction has been implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic GVHD, the role of B -cell 
dysfunction in acute GVHD remains less well defined. Acute GVHD is typi[INVESTIGATOR_285528] a T cell 
mediated process, with complex interactions through antigen presenting cell (APC) populations, 
regulatory T cel ls (T regs), B cell immune response and cytokine secretion.  Very recently, a new 
technology has been developed for the analysis of complex cell subsets, termed single- cell mass 
cytometry using the DVS CyTOF mass cytometer . Figure 4 shows a schematic of the CyTOF 
technology. This allows a systems level description of immune response through the simultaneous 
measurement of more than thirty cell surface marker proteins. The Irish lab has expertise in this 
technology and has used this assay in single cell interrogation in lymphoma and more specifically in BCR signalling
49-51. 
 
 
 
 
 
Appendix 1: Figures 5 to 8 outline the utility of CyTOF in not only dissecting the BCR signaling network 
but also to generate 2 dimensional heat -maps of 34+  dimensional data. The Irish lab has proven 
expertise in B cell biology using CyTOF. 
• We will employ single -cell mass cytometry to gain a more complete understanding of the impact 
of ibrutinib on B cell subsets and signalling post SCT 
Figure 4:  Workflow of CyTOF technology. Cells in single cell suspension are labelled with 
antibody conjugates tagged to chelated elemental isotope. Each cell can be tagged with 34 
probes and thus the output reflects 34+ dimensional single cell analyses. Both surface and 
intracellular targets can be interrogated.

• We will employ single -cell mass cytometry to gain a more complete understanding of the impact 
of ibrutinib and GVHD on T cell subsets and signalling post SCT 
 
It is anticipated that this may provide novel insights into the changes induced by [CONTACT_841057].   
 
Samples will be analysed through a collaborative effort with Drs. Dholaria and Irish (both at Vanderbilt 
University). Single -cell mass cytometry will be used to analyse blood taken from patients prior to 
administration of  ibrutinib, day [ADDRESS_1168487]. If patients develop new onset 
acute or chronic GVHD while on ibrutinib, an additional sample will be collected. We will objectively assess cellular heterogeneity from single- cell measurement data using an established computational 
approach, spanning- tree progression analysis of density -normalized events (SPADE) and ViSNE. In 
this work, we will ensure that all cell surface markers previously implicated in GVHD are included in the 
analysis. Single- cell ma ss cytometry will be carried out using the DVS CyTOF mass cytometer in the 
Flow Cytometry Core facility at Vanderbilt University. [CONTACT_841087]’s laboratory has validated a B -cell panel 
to interrogate B cell dysfunction in the context of lymphoma (see Figure s 6-8, Appendix 1). We expect 
that the same panel of B cell markers to give us adequate insight into the effect of ibrutinib on BCR signaling in the post -HCT period. In addition, we will interrogate cell subsets to include Th1, Th2, Treg, 
Th17, T effector cells, CD4+ T cell subsets (naïve, effector, memory, and central memory), antigen 
presenting cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages . Following core hematopoietic surface markers (12) 
have been validated by [CONTACT_941] (CD3, CD4, CD8, CD11b, CD19, CD20, CD38, CD45, CD45RA, CD90, 
CD123, HLADR). In addition, the following 15 markers are available (CD16, CD25, CD27, CD28, CD36, 
CD39, CD56, CD95, CD103,  CTLA4, CD161, CD62L, CD14). Eight  intracellular epi[INVESTIGATOR_841019]-activated cells can be interrogated (IFN- gamma , TNF-alpha, IL -10, IL -17, FoxP3, IL -6, IL-4, and IL -
13). This will allow us to get a complete pi[INVESTIGATOR_841020] T cell subsets in the post HCT setting.

• Dose level -2 = discontinue 
 
11.2 Dose Modifications for Use with CYP3A Inhibitors 
 
Avoid co- administration with strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors and consider alternative agents with 
less CYP3A inhibition.   
 
Concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors which would be taken chronically (e.g., ritonavir, indinavir, 
nelfinavir, saquinavir, boceprevir, telaprevir, nefazodone) is not recommended. For short -term use 
(treatment for 7 days or less) of strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., antifungals and antibiotics) consider 
interrupting IMBRUVICA therapy until the CYP3A inhibitor is no longer needed.   
 Reduce IMBRUVICA dose to [ADDRESS_1168500] be used (e.g., fluconazole, 
darunavir, erythromycin, diltiazem, atazanavir, aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053], amprenavir, fosamprevir, crizotinib, imatinib, verapamil, and ciprofloxacin) .  
 
VICC BMT1651 Protocol v 7: 2020DEC09  Page [ADDRESS_1168501] patients are expected to be on azoles (fluconazole , voriconazole or lower 
doses of posazconazole as outlined in the table below)  until day [ADDRESS_1168502], the dose of 
IMBRUVICA will be 140 mg per day. For patients receiving higher doses of posaconazole as 
outlined below, the dose of IMBRUVI CA will be 70 mg per day. Once these agents are stopped, 
the dose will  be escalated to 420 mg per day .  
 
11.3 Dose Modifications for Hepatic Impairment  
. For patients with mild liver impairment (Child -Pugh class A), the recommended dose is 140 mg daily 
(one capsule). Avoid the use of IMBRUVICA in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment 
(Child -Pugh classes B and C).  
 
12. P ROHIBITION AND RESTRICTIONS  
The following guidance should be applied during the perioperative period for subjects who require 
surgical intervention or an invasive procedure while receiving ibrutinib:  
 
• For any planned surgery or invasive procedure requiring sutures or staples for closure, ibrutinib should be held at least [ADDRESS_1168503] 7  days after the 
procedure, and restarted at the discretion of the investigator when the surgical site is reasonably 
healed without serosanguineous drainage or the need for drainage tubes.   
 

VICC BMT1651 Protocol v 7: 2020DEC09  Page 25 of 107 • For planned minor procedures (such as a central line placement, needle biopsy, thoracentesis, or 
paracentesis) ibrutinib should be held for at least [ADDRESS_1168504] is on ibrutinib, it is not necessary to hold ibrutinib for these procedures.  
• For emergency procedures, ibrutinib should be held after the procedure until the surgical site is 
reasonably healed, for at least [ADDRESS_1168505] practice (such as for emesis, diarrhea, etc.) are 
permitted. Use of neutrophil growth factors (filgrastim and pegfilgrastim  or other biosimilar  GCSF ) or 
red blood cell growth factors (erythropoietin) is permitted per institutional policy and in accordance with the ASCO guidelines. Transfusions may be given in accordance with institutional policy.  
 
13.2 Medications to be Used with Caution  
 
CYP3A Inhib itors/Inducers  
Concomitant use of ibrutinib and drugs that strongly or moderately inhibit CYP3A can increase  
ibrutinib exposure, and strong CYP3A inhibitors should be avoided.  In healthy volunteers, co -
administ ration of ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, increased Cmax and AUC of ibrutinib by 29- 
and 24- fold, respectively.  
 Voriconazole and posaconazole can be used concomitantly with ibrutinib, with dose modifications as 
described above in Section 11.2 . 
 
Strong inhibitors of  CYP3A (eg, ketoconazole, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, clarithromycin,  
telithromycin, itraconazole, nefazodone, and cobicistat) should be avoided, and an alternative  with less 
CYP3A inhibitory potential should be considered.  
 
For strong CYP3A inhibitors used short -term (e. g., antifungals and antibiotics for 7 days or less, e.g., 
ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole, clarithromycin, telithromycin) consider 
interrupting IMBRUVICA therapy during the duration of inhibitor use.  
 
Concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors which would be taken chronically (e.g., ritonavir, indinavir, 
nelfinavir, saquinavir, boceprevir, telaprevir, nefazodone) is not recomme nded.  
 Patients taking concomitant strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors should be monitored more closely 
for signs of IMBRUVICA toxicity. Avoid  grapefruit and Seville oranges during IMBRUVICA treatment, as 
these contain moderate inhibitors of CYP3A.  
 Administration of ibrutinib with strong inducers of CYP3A decreases ibrutinib plasma  
concentrations by [CONTACT_8622] 90%. Avoid concomitant use of strong CYP3A inducers (e.g., carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], rifampin, phenytoin and St. John’s Wort). Consider alternative agents with less CYP3A induction .

CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4/[ADDRESS_1168508]  weak inducers of CYP450 
isoenzymes in vitro. Therefore, it is unlikely that ibrutinib has any  clinically relevant drug -drug 
interactions with drugs that may be metabolized by [CONTACT_2750]450 enzymes . 
 
In vitro studies indicated that ibrutinib is not a substrate of P -glycoprotein (P -gp), but is a mild inhibitor 
(with an IC50 of 2.15 μg/mL). Ibrutinib is not expected to have systemic drug- drug interactions with P-
gp substrates. However, it cannot be excluded that ibrutinib could inhibit intestinal P -gp after a 
therapeutic dose. There is no clinical data available. Therefore, to avoid a potential interaction in the GI 
tract, narrow therapeutic range P -gp substrates such as digoxin, should be taken at least [ADDRESS_1168509]  occurred  in patients  treated with IMBRUVICA  includinggrade 3 or higher  
bleeding events  (subdural  hematoma,  gastrointestinal  bleeding,  hematu ria and post procedural  
hemorrhage) .IMBRUVICA may increase the risk of hemorrhage in patients receiving antiplatelet or 
anticoagulant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. 
 
Consider the benefit -risk of  withholding IMBRUVICA for at least [ADDRESS_1168510] -
surgery depending upon the type of surgery and the risk of bleeding ( refer to the Concomitant 
Medications section).  
 
Subjects requiring the initiation of therapeutic anticoagulation therapy (other than warfarin or a vitamin 
K antagonist) during the course of the study should have treatment with ibrutinib held, and ibrutinib 
should not be restarted until the subject is clinically stable. Subjects should be observed closely for 
signs and symptoms of bleeding. No dose reduction is required when study dr ug is restarted.

sparing treatment for non-B- cell malignancies may be considered with approval of the PI. 
 
Warfarin or vitamin K antagonists should not be administered concomitantly with ibrutinib.

Participants may be receiving other immunosuppressive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (including extra- corporeal 
photopheresis [ECP]) in addition to glucocorticoids. In addition, due to potential drug- drug interactions 
with ibrutinib, drug levels for immunosuppressant agents such as cyclosporine, tacrolimus, and/or 
sirolimus are highly recommended during the clinical trial. The doses for these immune- suppressants 
should be adjusted per institutional practices based on the measured drug level.  
 
Other strategies of GVHD therapy including PUVA, UVB light therapy, topi[INVESTIGATOR_841021] (e.g. for ocular GVHD) is permitted.  
15. M ANAGEMENT OF CORTICOSTEROIDS  
 
Systemic steroids may be decreased at the treating physician’s discretion. Non- absorbable oral 
steroids will be allowed and recorded. 
 
16. PROPHYLAXIS FOR INFECTION  
 
Prophylaxis for infections, including routine monitoring for CMV, EBV will be done per institutional 
practice. Pre -emptive therapy for CMV will be per institutional practice .  
 
Given the interaction of ibrutinib with azoles, please refer to dose modification section for appropriate dosing guidelines of ibrutinib.

than 1.[ADDRESS_1168515] axis  
§   Cytopenias cannot be used to determine disease progression in the presence of other 
immunosuppressive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. The cytopenias are defined as a decrease in hemoglobin level 
by [CONTACT_726] 2 g/dl (20g/L) or to less than 10 g/dl (100g/L) or a decrease in platelet count to less than 100,000µl (100x10
9/L) in the presence of clonal CLL infiltrates on the bone marrow 
biopsy.  
 
18.3.2  Complete Remission Requires All of the Following Criteria :  
 
• Absolute lymphocyte count <4000/microL (4 x 109/L).  
 
• No lymph nodes >1.5 cm in diameter.

>100,000/microL (100 x 109/L), and hemoglobin concentration >11 g/dL (110 g/L) in the 
absence of transfusion or growth factor support.  
 
• Bone marrow free of clonal CLL cells by [CONTACT_841059]/or 
immunohistochemistry and without nodular lymphoid aggregates .

fatigue that interferes with work or usual activities, fevers greater than 100.5°F (>38°C) for ≥2 weeks, 
or night sweats for >[ADDRESS_1168516] these symptoms that are not a result of CLL but attributable as a 
primary or secondary cause related to allogeneic stem cell  transplant. The cause of these symptoms 
should be documented by [CONTACT_093].  
 
 
VICC BMT1651 Protocol v 7: 2020DEC09  Page 29 of 107 18.3.3.  Partial Remission: At Least One of These Criteria Must be Documented:  
• A decrease in the peripheral absolute lymphocyte count by [CONTACT_2669] 50% from the level prior to 
therapy.  
 
• A reduction in previously enlarged nodes by [CONTACT_2669] 50% with no increase in the size of any 
single lymph node and no new enlarged lymph nodes. An increase of <25% in a lymph node <2 
cm is not considered significant.  
 
• If enlarged prior to therapy, the liver and spleen should be reduced in size by [CONTACT_2669] 50%.  
 
One of the following hematologic parameters must be met in addition to one of the above criteria in order to qualify for a PR:  
   
• ANC ≥1500/microL (1.5 x 10
9/L) or greater than 50% improvement over baseline (if this value 
was abnormally low at baseline) without granulocyte colony -stimulating factor support.  
 
• Platelet count ≥100,000/microL (100 x 109/L) or at least 50% improvement over baseline (if this 
value was abnormally low at baseline).  
 
• Hemo globin concentration ≥11 g/dL (110 g/L) or 50% improvement over baseline (if this value 
was abnormally low at baseline) without red blood cell transfusions or erythropoietin support.  
 
Note: Partial remission with Lymphocytosis: PR criteria with t he except ion of ALC are met  is 
consistent with a PR with lymphocytosis.  
  
18.3.4  Nodular Partial Remission:  
 
Persistent bone marrow nodules on bone marrow biopsy in patients achieving a CR or PR. Lymphoid aggregates should be evaluated with immunohistochemistry to determine whether they are comprised 
of CLL cells, lymphocytes other than CLL cells, or T cells.  
 
18.3.5  Stable Disease:  
 
Patients, who do not meet the criteria for a complete remission, partial remission, or progressive disease, have stable disease. Stable disease is therapeutically equivalent to a nonresponse ( i.e.,

24. STATISTICAL ANALYSES PL AN 
 
24.1 Analysis Plan 
 
The statistical analysis plan will address the primary aim:  To study the use of ibrutinib starting between 
day [ADDRESS_1168578] by 25% compared to historical controls. This will be restricted to cohort A which includes the 
diagnoses of CLL and MCL, only.  
 
• PFS is defined as time to progression, or relapse of the underlying disease for which transplant was undertaken, or death from any non -relapse causes , starting from the date of stem cell 
transplant (SCT) . 
 
• We will estimate the 12 -month PFS rate with a 95% confidence interval using the method of 
Kaplan- Meier and using the Greenwood variance estimator, and we will compare this estimate 
with the rate in the historical controls.  
 
• Historical data  
 
o In a study by [CONTACT_841067]53, the outcomes of patients with CLL after ablative (n=163) 
and reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) [ADDRESS_1168579] occurred (< 2000, or ≥ 2000). We expect the majority of patients with CLL on the proposed study to be undergoing RIC allo HCT, thus relevant data (≥ [ADDRESS_1168580]) are taken into account for sample size analyses. One 
year PFS was 62% (95% CI 51 -72). 
 
o In a study by [CONTACT_841068] -Ispi[INVESTIGATOR_841031]54, the outcomes of patients with MCL undergoing 
ablative (n=149) and RIC (n=351) allo- HCT was reported.  The 1y PFS for patients with 
MCL (personal communication, CIBMTR) was 52% (95% CI 47 -56) 
 
• The proportion of patients with CLL and MCL enrolling in this study will not be known at the start of the study or be controlled for during the accrual period. Thus, we studied the impact on power of varying proportions of these two diagnoses on outcome for a given effect size.  
 
• We will compare our overall PFS rate with the weighted average of the historical rates in CLL and MCL, using the proportion of our sample with each of these two diagnoses as the weights.  
VICC BMT1651 Protocol v 7: 2020DEC09  Page [ADDRESS_1168581] size, if we enroll 65 patients with varying proportion of 
the diagnoses.  These calculations  are based on the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for the 
mean survival time assuming exponentially- distributed PFS53 using the cube- root 
transformation of the MLE as suggested by [CONTACT_841069]54. The one- year survival probability can be 
calculated once the distribution is specified.  The following test statistic has a standard normal 
distribution:  
                                       
 
 
 
 
This is a single arm phase two study. Patients will be accrued uniformly over two years, and then followed for two years. The power calculations are based on derivations from Lawless
53 with a cube -
root trans -formation of the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE), as suggested by [CONTACT_841069]54 . This is 
implemented in the online calculator (tool of One Arm Survival) found at https://stattools.crab.org  which 
is provided by [CONTACT_841070]. Thus, [ADDRESS_1168582] 84% power to detect 
an effect size of 25% improvement in progression- free survival at [ADDRESS_1168583] size, if we enroll 65 patients with varying proportion of the diagnoses.

VICC BMT1651 Protocol v 7: 2020DEC09  Page 54 of 107 In addition,  cohort B will include 10 patients (FL and HD). There is no formal sample calculation for 
cohort B.  
 
24.[ADDRESS_1168585]. Patients may die of relapse or 
progression of disease, development or worsening of acute GVHD after exposure to study drug, 
development or worsening of chronic GVHD after exposure to study drug, infections in absence of GVHD or other causes (other non- relapse mortality) ( includes drug adverse effects).  
 Both cohort A and B will be at risk for these events and thus will be included in the safety analyses.  
In order to safeguard patients,  we have set the following limits:  
 
• Development of grade 3- [ADDRESS_1168586] no acute 
GVHD prior to starting experimental therapy should not be higher than 30%.   
 
• Development of grade 3- 4 acute GVHD for patients with grade1 -2 acute GVHD prior to starting 
experimental therapy s hould not be higher than 40%.   
 
• Development of grade 3- 4 acute GVHD for patients with any grade acute GVHD prior to starting 
experimental therapy should not be higher than 50%.  
 
• Cumulative incidence of infectious disease mortality (not related to GVHD) should not   be 
higher than 30% at [ADDRESS_1168587]  
 
• Cumulative incidence of non- relapse mortality (all cause) at [ADDRESS_1168588] should not be higher 
than 40%  
 
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_841032] B is an exploratory cohort of [ADDRESS_1168589] of a clinical trial.  
We will stop the trial early if the probability that treatment related events of the current regimen exceeds 
conventional treatment related AE is greater than 80%.   
 
The following tables describe the safety rules. There will be [ADDRESS_1168590] of the study to ensure the implementation of the safety rules.

will be collected after this period if the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_755489]/SAE to be causal ly-
related to the use of the study drug.  
For the purposes of this study, the J&Jmedicinal product is: Ibrutinib (Imbruvica) . 
 
The safety variables to be analyzed include adverse events, clinical laboratory test results (hematology 
and chemistry), and other safety measurements. They will be summarized by [CONTACT_9086]. In 
general, continuous variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics (n, mean, median, 
standard deviation, standard error and range). Categorical variables will be summarized using frequencies and percentages. No formal statistical testing is planned. Exposure to ibrutinib first dose 
and reasons for discontinuation from study treatment will be tabulated.  
 
25.2 Definitions  
 
25.2.1  Adverse Event (AE)  
 
An AE is  any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study subject administered a medicinal 
(investigational or non -investigational) product. An adverse event does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended 
sign (including an abnormal finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a 
medicinal (investigational or non - investigational) product, whether or not related to that medicinal 
(investigational or non -investigational) product. (Definition per International Conference on 
Harmonisation [ICH])  
VICC BMT1651 Protocol v 7: 2020DEC09  Page [ADDRESS_1168596] abnormalities.  
 
Adverse events may include, but are not limited to:  
 
• Subjective or objective symptoms provided by [CONTACT_5363]/or observed by [CONTACT_841071].  
 
• Any AEs experienced by [CONTACT_14205].  
 
• AEs not previously observed in the patient that emerge during the protocol -specified AE 
reporting period, including signs or symptoms associated with cGVHD that were not present 
before the AE reporting period 
 
• Complications that occur as a result of protoc ol-mandated interventions ( e.g., invasive 
procedures such as biopsies).  
 
The following are NOT considered AEs:  
 
• Pre-existing condition : A pre -existing condition (documented on the medical history CRF) is 
not considered an AE unless the severity, frequency, or character of the event worsens during 
the study period.  
 
• Pre-planned or elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]: A hospi[INVESTIGATOR_841033], but rather a therapeutic intervention. However, if during 
the pre- planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14148], which prolongs the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_528738], the event will be considered an SAE. Surgeries or interventions that were under consideration, but not performed before enrollment in the study, will not be considered serious if they are performed after enrollment in the study for a condition that has not changed 
from its baseline level. Elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14150], solely for the administration 
of chemotherapy, or due to long travel distances are also not SAEs.  
 
• Diagnostic Testing and Procedures:  Testing and procedures should not to be reported as 
AEs or SAEs, but rather the cause for the test or procedure should be reported.  
 
For the purposes of this clinical study, AEs include events which are either new or represent detectable 
exacerbations of pre -existing conditions as measured prior to HCT and prior to administration of 
ibrutinib.  
 
Adverse Events of Special Interest  
Adverse events of special interest are events that Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC. is actively monitoring 
as a result of a previously identified signal (even if non -serious). These adverse events are:  
   
VICC BMT1651 Protocol v 7: 2020DEC09  Page 58 of 107 Major Hemorrhage  
Major hemorrhage is defined as:  
• Any treatment -emergent hemorrhagic AE of Grade 3 or higher*  
• Any treatment -emergent SAE of bleeding of any grade 
• Any treatment -emergent CNS hemorrhage/hematoma of any grade  
• *all hemorrhagic AEs requiring a transfusion of red blood cells should be reported as  a Grade [ADDRESS_1168597] that is to be reported to Janssen  Scientific Affairs, LLC  should be 
recorded on a Serious Adverse Event Report Form and be reported to Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC  
within 24 hours of knowledge of the event.  
 
25.2.2  Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
 
A serious adverse event based on ICH and EU Guidelines on Pharmacovigilance for Medicinal 
Products for Human Use is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
 
• Results in death ( i.e., the AE actually causes  or leads to death).  
 
• Is life -threatening. Life -threatening is defined as an AE in which the patient was at risk of death 
at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused 
death if it were more severe. If either  the Investigator or the Sponsor believes that an AE meets 
the definition of life- threatening, it will be considered life- threatening.  
 
• Requires in- patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] >24 hours or prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
 
• Results in persistent or sig nificant disability/incapacity ( i.e., the AE results in substantial 
disruption of the patient’s ability to conduct normal life functions).  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
 
• Is a suspected transmission of any infectious agent via a medicinal product  
 
• Is an important medical event that may not result in death, be immediately life- threatening or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, the event may jeopardize the patient or patient may require intervention to prevent 
one of the other outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such events are intensive 
treatment in an emergency department or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, or convulsion that does not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
 
 Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is also 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31348]. These should usually be considered serious.  
VICC BMT1651 Protocol v 7: 2020DEC09  Page 59 of 107 Severity Criteria (Grade 1- 5) 
 
Definitions found in the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03  
(CTCAE v4.03) will be used for grading the severity (intensity) of AEs. The CTCAE v4.0 displays 
Grades 1 through 5 with unique clinical descriptions of severity for each referenced AE. Should a patient experience any AE not listed in the CTCAE v4.03, the following grading system should be used to assess severity:  
 
• Grade 1 (Mild AE) – experiences which are usually transient, requiring no special treatment, and 
not interfering with the patient’s daily activities  
 
• Grade 2 (Moderate AE) – experiences which introduce some level of inconvenience or concern 
to the patient, and which may interfere with daily activities, but are usually ameliorated by [CONTACT_14212]  
 
• Grade 3 (Severe AE) – experiences which are unacceptable or intolerable, significantly interrupt 
the patient’s usual daily activity, and require systemic drug therapy or other treatment  
 
• Grade 4 (Life- threatening or disabling AE) – experiences which cause the patient to be in 
imminent danger of death  
• Grade 5 (Death related to AE) – experiences which result in patient death  
 
Adverse Event Reporting Timeframe  
 
Adverse events will be captured from the time of consent  until [ADDRESS_1168598] cessation of stu dy drug. 
 
Causality (Attribution)  
 The Investigator is to assess the causal relation ( i.e., whether there is a reasonable possibility that the 
study drug caused the event) using the following definitions:  
• Definite – The AE is clearly related
 to the study t reatment  
• Probable – The AE is likely related  to the study treatment  
• Possible – The AE may be related  to the study treatment  
• Unlikely - The AE is doubtfully related  to the study treatment  
• Unrelated - The AE is clearly NOT related  to the study treatment  
 
NOTE: DEATH FOR ANY REASON SHOULD BE REPORTED AS A SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT.  
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_841034], it is the sign, symptom or diagnosis which led to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_172792].  
 
Any event requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_312200] a serious adverse event, except hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23741]:  
 
VICC BMT1651 Protocol v 7: 2020DEC09  Page 60 of 107 • Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23742] (e.g., social reasons 
such as pending placement in long- term care facility)  
 
• Surgery or procedure planned before entry into the study. [Note: Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_841035]. Any adverse event that results in a prolongation of the originally planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23745] a new serious adverse event.]  
Life-Threatening Conditions  
 
Disease progression should not be recorded as an adverse event or serious adverse event term; instead, signs and symptoms of clinical sequelae resulting from disease progression/lack of efficacy will 
be reported if they fulfill the serious adverse event definition.  
 
25.3 Individual Case Safety Report (ICSR)  
 
A valid ICSR must contain the four minimum criteria required to meet regulatory reporting requirements:  
 
• an identifiable subject (but not disclosing personal information such as the subject’s name, initials or 
address)  
• an identifiable reporter (investigational site)  
• a J&Jmedicinal product  
• an adverse event, outcome, or certain special situations  
 
The minimum information required is:  
• suspected Janssen medicinal product (doses, indication)  
• date of therapy (start and end date, if available)  
• batch or lot number, if available 
• subject details (subject ID and country)  
• gender  
• age at AE onset  
• reporter ID  
• adverse event detail (AE verbatim in English), onset date, relatedness, causality, action taken, 
outcome, (if available)  
• J&J protocol ID  
 
 
25.[ADDRESS_1168599] Quality Complaint (PQC)  
 
A product quality compliant is defined as any suspi[INVESTIGATOR_1884] a product defect  related to a potential quality issue 
during manufacturing, packaging, release testing, stability monitoring, dose preparation, storage or 
distribution of the product, or delivery system.  Not all PQCs involve a subject.  Lot and batch numbers are of high significance and need to be collected whenever available.  
 
Examples of PQC include but not limited to:  
 
• Functional Problem: e.g., altered delivery rate in a controlled release product  
VICC BMT1651 Protocol v 7: 2020DEC09  Page 61 of 107 • Physical Defect:  e.g. abnormal odor, broken or crushed tablets/capsules  
• Potential Dosing Device Malfunction: e.g.  autoinjector button not working, needle detaching from 
syringe  
• Suspected Contamination  
• Suspected Counterfeit  
 
25.5 Unlisted (unexpected) Adverse Event/ Reference Safety Information  
 
An “unexpected” AE is an AE that is not listed in the Investigator's Brochure/package insert or is not 
listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed. For example, hepatic necrosis would be 
“unexpected” (by [CONTACT_14213]) if the Investigator's Brochure referred only to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be “unexpected” (by [CONTACT_14214]) if the Investigator's Brochure/package insert listed only 
cerebral vascular accidents. "Unexpected" also refers to AEs that are mentioned in the Investigator's 
Brochure as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the 
drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the study drug under investigation.

death, stillbirth, congenital anomaly, ectopic pregnancy) are considered serious adverse events and 
must be reported using the Serious Adverse Event Form.  
 Any subject who becomes pregnant during the study must be promptly withdrawn from the study and discont inue further study treatment.  
 Because the effect of the J&J medicinal product on sperm is unknown, pregnancies in partners of male 
subjects exposed to a J&J medicinal product will be reported  to the Vanderbilt Coordinating Center

VICC BMT1651 Protocol v 7: 2020DEC09  Page [ADDRESS_1168613] Retention  
 
The Investigator/study staff must maintain adequate and accurate records to enable the conduct of the 
study to be fully documented and the study data to be subsequently verified. Essential documentation 
includes, but is not limited to, the IB, signed protocols and amendments, IRB/IEC approval letters 
(dated), signed Form FDA 1572 and Financial Disclosures, signed ICFs (including subject confidentiality information), drug dispensing and accountability records, shippi[INVESTIGATOR_197745] -related materials, signed (electronically), dated and completed CRFs, 
documentation of CRF corrections, SAE forms transmitted to Vanderbilt, notification of SAEs and 
related reports, source documentation, normal laboratory values, curricula vitae for investigators, and 
all relevant correspondence and other documents pertaining to the conduct of the study.  
 
The Investigator must notify Vanderbilt and obtain written approval from Vanderbilt before destroying 
any clinical study documents or images (e.g., scan, radiograph, ECG tracing) at any time. Should an Investigator wish to assign the study records to another party or move them to another location, advance written notice will be given to Vanderbilt. Vanderbilt will inform the Investigator of the date that 
study records may be destroyed or returned to Vanderbilt. 
 Vanderbilt must be notified in advance of, and Vanderbilt must provide express written approval of, any change in the maintenance of the foregoing documents if the Investigator wishes to move study records to another location or assign responsibility for record retention to another party. If the Investigator 
cannot guarantee the archiving requirements set forth herein at his or her study site for all such 
documents, special arrangements must be made between the  
 Investigator and Vanderbilt to store such documents in sealed containers away from the study site so that they can be returned sealed to the Investigator for audit purpos es. 
 U.S. FDA regulations (21 CFR §312.62[c]) require that records and documents pertaining to the conduct of this study and the distribution of investigational drug, including CRFs, consent forms, laboratory test results, and medication inventory records,  must be retained by [CONTACT_841076] [INVESTIGATOR_54069]. If no application is filed, these records must be kept two years after the study is discontinued and the U.S. FDA and the applicable national and local health authorities are notified.  Following closure of the study, each participating institution will maintain a copy of all site study records 
in a safe and secure location. The Sponsor  Investigator  will inform the Investigator at each site at such 
time that  the records may be destroyed.  
 
26.[ADDRESS_1168614] with all required study data accurately recorded such that the information matches the data contained in medical records (e.g., physicians’ notes, nurses’ notes, clinic charts and other study -specific source 
documents). Authorized study site personnel (i.e., listed on the Delegation of Authority log) will 
complete CRFs designed for this study according to the completion guidelines that will be provided. 
The Investigator will ensure that the CRFs are accurate, complete, legible, and completed within the 
required amount of time. At all times, the Investigator has final responsibility for the accuracy and 
VICC BMT1651 Protocol v 7: 2020DEC09  Page [ADDRESS_1168615] within  an electronic data capture (EDC) system  called REDCap  with controlled access 
managed by [CONTACT_841077].  
 The Vanderbilt University Office of Research will be used as a central location for data processing and management. Vanderbilt University, with collaboration from a consortium of institutional partners, has 
developed a software toolset and workflow methodology for electronic collection and management of research and clinical trial data. REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) is a secure, web- based 
application that is flexible enough to be used for a variety of types of research. REDCap provides an intuitive user interface that streamlines project development and improves data entry through real -time 
validat ion rules (with automated data type and range checks). REDCap also provides easy data 
manipulation (with audit trails for reporting, monitoring and querying patient records) and an automated export mechanism to common statistical packages (SPSS, SAS, Stata , R/S -Plus). In addition to 
traditional data capture functionality, REDCap’s survey capabilities are a powerful tool for building and managing online surveys. The research team can create and design surveys in a web browser and 
engage potential respondents  using a variety of notification methods. All data collection projects rely on 
a thorough, study -specific data dictionary, defined by [CONTACT_266605], 
self-documenting process. This iterative development and testing process  results in a well -planned and 
individualized data collection strategy. 
 
REDCap servers are housed in a local data center at Vanderbilt, and all web- based information 
transmission is encrypted. REDCap was developed specifically around HIPAA -Security guidel ines and 
is recommended to Vanderbilt researchers by [CONTACT_841078]. 
REDCap has been disseminated for local use at more than 940 other academic/non -profit consortium 
partners in 75 countries. Vanderbilt leads the REDCap Consortium, which currently supports more than 
99,000 projects and 128,000 users. More information about the consortium and system security can be 
found at http://www.projectredcap.org/.  
 Study staff will be appropriately trained in the use of CRFs and application of electronic signatures 
before the start of the study and before being given access to the EDC system. Original data and any changes of data will be recorded using the EDC system, with all changes tracked by [CONTACT_135953]. The Investigator attests that the information contained in the CRFs is true by [CONTACT_36100].  
 
 
  
26.8 Study Monitoring and Audit Requirements  
 
The Sponsor -investigator will monitor this trial continuously until study completion.  
 The Vanderbilt -Ingram Cancer Center (VICC) oversees patient safety and data monitoring for its 
investigator -initiated and NIH -NCI funded clinical trials through its Data and Safety Monitoring 
Commi ttee (DSMC). The purpose of the DSMC is to ensure the efficient implementation and 
management of VICC Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP). The Committee maintains authority to intervene in the conduct of studies as necessary to ensure clinical research performed at VICC achieves the highest quality standards.  
VICC BMT1651 Protocol v 7: 2020DEC09  Page 70 of 107  
The VICC DSMC meets on a quarterly basis and ad hoc to discuss data and safety monitoring of clinical trials and to oversee the VICC DSMP. Internal audits for compliance with adverse event 
reporting, regulatory and study requirements, and data accuracy and completion are conducted 
according to the VICC DSMP according to study phase and risk. The committee reviews all serious adverse events (SAE) on Vanderbilt sponsored investigator -initiated studies  on a quarterly basis and 
provides DSMC SAE review reports to the Vanderbilt IRB.  
 A Research Compliance auditor under the direction of the DSMC will audit this clinical trial every [ADDRESS_1168616] operating procedures (SOPs), and other written instructions, and to ensure the quality and integrity of the data.  
 This study is also subject to other reviews or audits at any time during or after completion of this study. 
All study -related documentation must be made available to the designated auditor. In addition, a 
representative of the FDA or other Regulatory Agencies may choose to inspect a study site at any time 
before, during, or after completion of the clinical study. Janssen Scientific Affairs may choose to inspect 
a study site at any time before, during,  or after completion of the clinical study.  
 
To assure the accuracy of data collected in the CRFs, it is mandatory that the monitor/auditor have 
access to all original source documents, including all electronic medical records (EMR) at reasonable times and upon reasonable notice. During the review of source documents, every effort will be made to 
maintain the anonymity and confidentiality of all subjects during this clinical study. However, because of 
the experimental nature of this treatment, the Investigator agrees to allow the IRB/IEC and Vanderbilt 
and its authorized employees of the appropriate regulatory authority to inspect the facilities used in this study and, for purposes of verification, allow direct access to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_841038]. A statement to this effect will be included in the informed consent and permission form authorizing the use of protected health information.

and for one year after the study has been completed.  
26.12 Protocol Amendments  
 
The Sponsor  Investigator  is responsible for the development and coordination of all protocol 
amendments. The Sponsor  Investigator  will obtain Vanderbilt IRB approval for the protocol amendment 
and then disseminate the amendment to participating institutions for submission to their IRBs/IECs. Any 
change to the informed consent document must be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_841079]/IEC at participating institutions.  
 Written documentation of IRB/IEC approval must be received by [CONTACT_841080].  
 
No other significant or consistent change in the study procedures, except to eliminate an immediate 
hazard, shall be effected without the mutual agreement of the Investigator and the Sponsor.  
 
26.[ADDRESS_1168621] accruals of eligible subjects shall be listed as lead authors on manuscripts and reports of study results. The study director and/or lead statistician 
may also be included in the list of authors. This custom can be adjusted upon mutual agreement of the authors , the Sponsor  Investigator  and Janssen Scientific Affairs and in accordance with current

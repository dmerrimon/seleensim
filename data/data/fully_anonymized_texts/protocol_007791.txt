Protocol Title:  Role of Canagliflozin on gene expression and function of CD34+ 
endothelial progenitor cells in patients with type 2 diabetes  
Site Numbers & Names  GWU Medical Faculty Associates  
 
Research Hypothesis:  Type 2 diabetes is associated with poor stem cell number and 
function. Poor viability and function of EPCs in diabetes affects the 
repair and regenera tion of the endothelium. We hypothesize that use 
of Canagliflozin (Cana), along with certain anti -diabetic drugs  may 
help reduce cardiovascular risk by [CONTACT_570952].   
 
Study Sche ma: Drugs / 
Doses / Length of 
Treatment  We propose a [ADDRESS_749850] velocity (PWV) 
changes. Patients will be randomized to 2 groups:  
 
Control (n=20) Concomitant Anti -Diabetic Therap y + Placebo.  
Treatment (n=20) Concomitant Anti -Diabetic Therapy  + Cana 100mg .

 Study Objectives:  
 Primary  
 Secondary  The primary objective is to ascertain if the addition of Cana improves 
CD34+ cell function and gene expression in type 2 diabetes patients, 
which will be correlated to improvement in 24hr urinary protein 
estimation and creatinine clearance (obtained via micro -
albumin/creatinine ratio from a spot urine sample).  
 
The secondary objective is to correlate the cellular outcome measures 
with other measures of endothelial function such as:  
1. Arterial stiffness measures with Pulse wave analysis and pulse 
wave velocity measurements.  
2. Serum biochemistry looking at surrogates of endothelial health, 
endothelial inflammation, appetite controlling horm one levels and 
fasting glucose, insulin and lipid profile.  
3. Resting M etabolic Rate measurement  
 
Study Outcome Measures:  
Primary:  
To investigate the effect of Cana on Endothelial function in patients 
inadequately controlled (HbA1C ≥  7.0 % to ≤ 10%) while being treated 
with a stable dose of  certain anti -diabetic drugs .  
 Cellular markers. We will study pre and post Cana treatment 
changes in number, function and gene expression of patients’ 
peripheral blood -derived CD34+ cells.  
 Renal Function Estimation: 24hr urinary protein estimation , 
creatinine clearance  and urine exosome study . 
 
Secondary:  
To investigate the effect of Cana treatment on:  
 Serum  endothelial inflammatory markers  including high 
sensitivity C -reactive protein (hs -CRP), IL -6, TNF-alpha and 
fasting lipid profile.  
 Glycemic control  will be evaluated by [CONTACT_570953], insulin, and HbA1c levels and assessing insulin 
resistance using HOMA -IR. 
 Adiposity,  measured using a body composition analyzer scale, 
measured as percentage body fat. 
 Creatinine clearance estimation.  
 Vessel health will be assessed by [CONTACT_570954], SphygmoCor CP system from 
ATCOR.  
 Central and aortic blood pre ssure  estimated by [CONTACT_570955].  
 Resting Metabolic Rate  (RMR, similar to Resting Energy 
expenditure measurement) at baseline, midway point (week 8) 
and post therapy.

protocol.  
Criteria for 
Evaluation:  
(Efficacy, safety,  
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004], etc.)  Subjects will be phone screened to determine initial eligibility. If the phone -
screening indicates possible eligibility, then the subjects will come to an in -
person screening visit at week -2, then evaluated for end points at weeks 0, [ADDRESS_749854] dose of study 
drug to assess for adverse effects.  
 
Study participation will be stopped for adverse effects at the discretion of the

any reason.  
 
Statis tics: The total sample size is requested, after accounting for attrition over the 16 -
week period, is 20 subjects per group or 40 subjects total. Sample size 
estimates were based on the effects of exercise on CD34+/KDR+ cells as 
described in the literature.   The effect of a single session, as well as extended 
training, on healthy subjects or those with existing cardiovascular conditions 
appears to increase the CD34+/KDR+ cells.  
   
This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] ; as a result appropriate power calculation is not feasi ble. 
We however did conduct power analysis, which provided us with 73% power 
(see statistics section).  A p -value of less than 0.05 will be considered 
statistically significant.

 INTRODUCTION  
Diabetes affects more than 11% of adults in the [LOCATION_002] and this is proje cted to nearly double 
by 2025.[ADDRESS_749855] common causes of 
kidney di sease2,3,4. Use of a sodium -glucose linked transporter (SGLT -2) inhibitor has shown promise in 
improving glycemic control, weight reduction, hypertension and even changes in circulating Renin -
angiotensin -aldosterone system (RAAS) and nitric oxide (NO)5,[ADDRESS_749856] on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk modification or on endothelium or endothelial 
progenitor cells as a surrogate of cardiovascular and renal risk outcome measure, is unclear5.  
We have previously shown that CD34+ cells, derived from peripheral blood can act as a cellular 
biomarker that is more reliable than serum based markers7 for CVD risk  estimation. Serum based 
inflammatory markers are not useful  until the endothelium is already damaged and inflamed4. Such serum 
based biomarker s takes several months to change and gives no preventive and predictable information as 
to whether a particular medication may affect future endothelium. This is why the study of endothelium 
progenitors is crucial. In our previous study of a prediabetes po pulation with an aerobic exercise 
intervention, we have demonstrated that CD34+ cells are responsive to a change in therapy or 
intervention within 2 -4 weeks and can be used as a reliable non serum based cellular bio -marker7. CD34+ 
cells or endothelial progenitor cells have been used clinically to improve collateral circulation and have 
been extensively studied as a robust cardiovascular biomarker 8,9,7. Therefore studying CD34+ cells in 
patients, with or without Canagliflozin (Cana) can give vital informat ion about the medication and its 
effect on endothelium. This is particularly important as another SGLT2 inhibitor Empagliflozin has 
shown unparalled positive cardiovascular effects with an oral hypoglycemic agent10. Of course, the 
question arises whether th is clinical trial effect is secondary to glucose effect or direct effect of 
SGLT2 inhibitor on endothelium.  
Multiple glucose transporters have been identified in human cells these include GLUTs, 
SGLTs and even taste receptors (such as TLR2 and TLR3). We k now SGLT transporters are 
present in tubular cells and clearly blocking of SGLT2 in these cells is beneficial. Information on 
glucose transporter in stem or progenitor cells is almost nil. In our lab we have shown presence 
of GLUT1, SGLTs and TLR3 on CD34+  cells. We have also demonstrated that hyperglycemia is 
toxic to CD34+ cells, more than CD31+ positive mature endothelial cells. We hypothesize that 
blocking SGLT2 in CD34+ cells will be beneficial rather than detrimental. As far as glucose 
uptake in CD34+  cells are concerned other glucose transporters should be sufficient, in fact

 lesser amount of glucose entry in a hyperglycemic milieu (type 2 DM patients) may be less pro -
inflammatory and less pro -apoptotic.  
Our preliminary data  indicates that mRNA gene e xpression of both SGLT1 and SGLT2 
are noted on human CD34+ cells ho wever only SGLT2 mRNA gene expression is up -regulated 
several fold in human CD34+ cells in presence of hyperglycemia (20mM glucose). However non primary 
commercially obtained human endothel ium (HUVEC) do not show similar results. An explanation could 
be SGLT2 expression decreases as the cell transitions from progenitor to mature endothelium. From these 
results we believe SGLT2 inhibitor will be effective on progenitors and not mature endothe lium. We 
therefore hypothesize that CD34+ cells will be an ideal biomarker to study the effect of the drug. It is 
possible that Cana, by [CONTACT_501851]2 receptors, may influence other CD34+ cell surface receptors 
including other glucose transporters and inf luence its function (most importantly migration). If a 
particular medication positively influences stem/progenitor cell migration then that medication can 
positively influence endothelial dysfunction and vascular complications from diabetes. We are 
particu larly interested to note effect of Canagliflozin, a SGLT2 inhibitor on other glucose transporters 
such as GLUT 1 and 4 while looking at SGLT 1 and 2 on CD34+ cells. I t will be helpful to discern these 
effects particularly when choice of oral diabetic medic ation in a type [ADDRESS_749857] of Cana 
on CD34+ cells, in a placebo matched study. We plan to recruit subjects with type 2 diabetes with the 
following characteristics: 1) overweight, mild and moderately obese (BMI=25.0 -39.9); 2) individuals 
with type 2 diabetes with inadequate c ontrol, HbA1C= 7 to 10.0 %, on any combination of the 
following anti -diabetic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]: metformin (1 -2 grams) , insulin, GLP -1 agonists, a DPP -IV 
inhibitor , or sulfonylureas 3) with no current macrovascular complications. As per the ADA [2], 
Metformin , insu lin, GLP -[ADDRESS_749858], particularly in presence of endothelial dys function. For accurate comparison, both 
placebo and the Canagliflozin  group will be on any combination of the following anti -diabetic 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]: metformin (1 -2 grams) , insulin, GLP -1 agonists, a DPP -IV inhibitor , or sulfonylureas 
We will recruit a total of  40 patients (20 individuals/per group) with approx imately a 20% drop out rate 
over two years and we hope to retain 32 individuals (16 /group). Individuals in each group will be matched 
by [CONTACT_4321], age, and race. Participants will be assessed at baseline (week 0), and at 2 and 4 months of drug 
intake.

 1 RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS  
We hypothesize that Cana may be able to improv e number and function of CD34+ endothelial 
progenitor cells. We also propose that this expected cardiovascular benefit is independent of HbA1C 
reduction11,12. 
In this proposed study we plan to recruit patients with type 2 diabetes, who are on any combination 
of the following anti -diabetic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]: metformin (1 -2 grams) , insulin, GLP-1 agonists, a DPP -IV 
inhibitor , or sulfonylureas , but still remain inadequately controlled with HbA1C between  7.0% and 10% 
(both values inclusive), but not overtly out of control (> 10% of HbA1C).  
Subjects will begin taking 100 mg of Cana or placebo after initial 4 weeks. Subjects will be 
withdrawn from the study if the medication or placebo is not tolerated.  
 
2 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE  
 
To determine whether 4 months of Canagliflozin modifies CD34+ cell number, gene 
expression and migration function.  
 
PROTOCOL FOR OBTAINING CD34+  CELLS :  
We will obtain a total of approximately 9 5 mL of periph eral blood per visit. Of these 9 5 mL, 
60-70 mL will be used to obtain CD34+ cells from mononuc lear cell (MNC) population and 25 -
35 mL for biochemistry and plasma  ELISA assays. MNC will be obtained from  whole blood 
similar to protocols described before13,14. MNCs will be put through CD34 magnetic bead column 
to obtain CD34+ cells (Miltenyi Biotec). Purity of CD34+ cells, post sort, usually is above 90%, 
to be verified by [CONTACT_53409].  
 
A. From Mononuclear (M NC) population (pre CD34+ magnetic column sorting): We will 
assess the proportion of various cell types, progenitor stems and mature cells in MNCs to 
note if Cana influences stem vs non stem cell pool such as percentage of : CD34, CD309 
(VEGFR2 -KDR), CD184  (CXCR4), receptor substrate for SDF1 alpha, CD31 (PECAM -
1, a mature circulating endothelial cell marker), CD133 (a progenitor marker), CD144 
(Vascular Endothelial cadherin), Sytox Blue OR Propi[INVESTIGATOR_570939] (to detect 
apoptotic cells).  
B. MNC cells ( prior to CD34 magnetic bead sorting) will be also used to assay CFU Hill 
Colony forming unit (Stem Cell Technologies - Cat#[ZIP_CODE]) media for Colony Forming unit 
(CFU) Assay. CFU will be counted on [ADDRESS_749859] plating (from initial plating).  
C. From CD 34+ ce ll population (Post Sorting):  
a. Migration Assay using SDF1Alpha concentrations of 0, 10, 100ng/ml and VEGF -
A concentrations of 20 and 50 ng/ml, using 150,000 cells in 300ul serum free cell 
suspension media per insert.  
b. Gene expression studies. Genes to be as sessed on sorted CD34 positive cells:

Protocol Version: 3.0 
Date: 12/15/2017    Page 9 of 35 
 i. Endothelial lineage cell surface markers: CD34, VEGFR2 (KDR), CD31, 
CD144  
ii. For Anti -oxidant gene expression: Superoxide dismutase (SOD) 1, [ADDRESS_749860]: p53, p21, Bcl2, caspase -3 
iv. Endothelial Function Assay Gene: endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase, von -
Willebrand’s Factor  
v. Genes associated with progenitor cell chemotaxis: VEGF -A, SDF1 alpha, 
CXCR4.  
 
SECONDARY OBJECTIVE  
 
To determine whether use of Canagliflozin alters other cardio -metabolic health indicator 
parameters such as: arterial stiffness measures, resting metabolic rate, body composition 
measures, hs -CRP, IL -6, TNF -alpha (inflammatory markers), fasting lipid profi le, levels of 
insulin, glucose appetite controlling hormones and urine levels of microalubumin 
(Microalbumin/Creatinine ratio) . 
 
We expect to corroborate our findings of the Primary Objective  (cellular outcome measures) 
with traditional markers of endothel ial/ vascular function such as serum biochemistry and arterial 
stiffness.  
 
Effect of Cana on Serum Biochemistry:  
While we believe cell based biomarker s are superior to traditional serum biomarkers, we believe 
the outcome report will be stronger if one can show positive co -relation between the two 
outcome measures. We therefore will be looking at:  
I. Inflammation, apoptosis and anti -oxidant protein levels: Highly selective  C-reactive 
protein (hs -CRP), IL -6, TNF -alpha , fasting glucose, insulin and lipid pr ofile.  
a. Glycemic control will be evaluated by [CONTACT_570958], insulin 
levels and HbA1c. Fasting blood glucose, insulin and lipid profile will be used to 
assess insulin resistance15,16 (32, 37 ) 
II. Plasma  SDF1 alpha (ELISA) and GLP -1 (ELISA) will be estimated to assess endothelial 
health and factors that may influence CD34+ cell chemotaxis  
III. Estimation of Creati nine Clearance and proteinuria: 24hr urinary protein estimation and 
creatinine clearance (obtained via micro -albumin/creatinine ratio from a spot urine 
sample).  
a. Subjects will have the option of opting into a sub -study that is being run by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. 
Eric Nylen at the Veterans Affairs  (VA) Maryland Health Care Syste m. 10-20 mL 
of the excess fresh spot urine that has been collected would be sent to the VA for 
exosome analysis. This is optional, and is not required of subjects. For details of 
urine -exosome study please see page 31.  
IV. The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) will be estimated using the CKD -EPI (Chronic 
Kidney Disease Epi[INVESTIGATOR_10444]) equation. The CKD -EPI [INVESTIGATOR_10908], 
expressed as a single equation, is: 
a. GFR = 141 X min (Scr/κ,1)α X max(Scr/κ,1)-1.209 X 0.993Age X 1.018 [if female] 
X 1.159 [if black]; where Scr is serum creatinine (mg/dL), κ is 0.7 for females and

Protocol Version: 3.0 
Date: 12/15/2017    Page 10 of 35 
 0.9 for males, α is –0.329 for females and –0.411 for males, min indicates the 
minimum of  Scr/κ or 1, and max indicates the maximum of Scr/κ or 117. 
 
Effect of Cana on Body Habitus (Determination of body composition and visceral fat) AND 
Resting Metabolic Rate.   
As we plan to study cardio -metabolic effect of Cana we believe the RMR and body composition 
data is useful.  
I. Using body c omposition  scale:  
a. Height and weight will be measured and the body mass index (BMI=kg•m -2) 
used as an indicator of relative weight.  
b. The body composition  scale calculates body fat%, total body water% , fat free 
mass, etc. in addition to BMI.   
II. Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR): at weeks 0, 8 and 16 of the protocol using ReeVue 
(trademark) machine, with or without SGLT2 inhibitor therapy to ascertain if Cana has 
any effect on RMR. Other related trials have shown weight loss b ut effect on metabolic 
rate has not been studied18. 
 
 
 
Effect of Cana on  Assays of Arterial Stiffness :  
I. We will acquire Pulse Wave An alysis and Vascular Flow using SphygmoCor CP system 
from ATCOR as a measure of central arterial pressure and arterial stiffness. Again 
SGLT2 inhibitors have been shown to reduce systolic blood pressure but effect on 
stiffness has not been looked at, except with Empagliflozin17,[ADDRESS_749861] analysis (PWA) and pulse 
wave velocity (PWV).  
IV. Arterial stiffness will be assessed using Vascular Flow and wave form analysis 
equipment, SphygmoCor CP system from ATCOR19.

 metformin (1 -2 grams) , insulin, GLP-[ADDRESS_749864], particularly in presence 
of endothelial dysfunction. Also both the placebo and Canagliflozin  group will be on any 
combination of the following anti -diabetic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]: metformin (1 -2 grams) , insulin, GLP-1 
agonists, a DPP -IV inhibitor , or sulfonylureas . Our study population will include equal numbers of 
adult male and fem ale Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) patients aged 30-70 years, enrolled in both arms 
of the study.  
 
Patients will be treated with 100 mg of Cana or placebo for 16 weeks.  This time interval has 
been previously shown to be adequate to observe changes to Endothelial Progenitor Cells 
(EPCs)13,23. 
 
STUDY POPULATION  
Inclusion Criteria:  
 
1) Signed written informed consent  
 Before any study procedures are performed, subjects will have the details of the 
study described to them, and they will be given a written informed consent 
document to read. Then, if subjects consent to participate in the study, they will 
indicate that consent by [CONTACT_570959].  
2) Target Population  
 Subjects with a diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes mellitus  using criteria of the American 
Diabetes Association.  
 Currently treated with any combination of the following anti -diabetic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]: 
metformin (1 -2 grams) , insulin, GLP-1 agonists, a DPP -IV inhibitor , or 
sulfonylureas  
 HbA1C between 7.0% and 10% (both inclusive)   
 BMI 25 -39.9 kg/m2 both inclusive.  
One of the prime outcome measure is estimation of renal function and accurate eGFR 
staging: Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate Serum Cr should be used to estimate 
glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Estimated GFR (eGFR) is commonly reported by 
[CONTACT_570960] (MDRD)  study equation or the Chronic Kidney Disease Epi[INVESTIGATOR_10444] 
(CKD -EPI) equation. The latter is the preferred GFR estimating equation. GFR calculators 
are available at http:// www.nkdep.nih.gov .  
Abnormal  urinary albumin excretion and eGFR may be used to stage chronic kidney disease 
(CKD). The National Kidney Foundation classification (Table below) is based on both 
kidney damage (UACR at or above 30 mg/g Cr) and eGFR.  
Normal UACR i s defined as less than 30  mg/g Cr, and increased urinary albumin excretion is 
defined as at or above 30 mg/g Cr. Because of variability in urinary albumin excretion, 
ideally two (at  least one) specimens of UACR should have been collected within a [ADDRESS_749865] albuminuria.

  Eligibility criteria for this study have been carefully considered to ensure the safe ty of the 
study subjects and to ensure that the results of the study can be used. It is imperative that 
subjects fully meet all eligibility criteria.  
 
DISCONTINUATION OF SUBJECTS FROM TREATMENT  
Subjects MUST  discontinue from the investigational product (and non -investigational product at 
the discretion of the investigator) for any of the following reasons:  
 Withdrawal of informed consent (subject’s decision to withdraw for any reason)  
 Any clinical adverse even t, laboratory abnormality, or inter -current illness which, in the

impris oned or involuntarily incarcerated for the treatment of either a psychiatric or 
physical illness). If a subject withdraws before completing the study, the reason for 
withdrawal must be documented appropriately.  
 
 
4 TREATMENTS  
 
STUDY TREATMENT : CANAGLIFLOZI N 
Definition of Investigational Product:  A pharmaceutical form of an active substance or placebo 
being tested or used as a reference in a clinical study, including products already with a 
marketing authorization but used or assembled (formulated or package d) in a way different from 
the authorized form, or used for an unauthorized indication, or when used to gain further 
information about the authorized form. In this protocol, the investigational product is 
Cana gliflozin . 
 
Definition of Non -Investigational Product: Other medications used in the study as support or 
escape medication for preventative, diagnostic, or therapeutic reasons as components of a given 
standard of care. In this protocol, the non -investigational product s are Metformin , Insulin , GLP -1 
agonists, sulfonylureas, and DPP -IV inhibitors .  Patients will continue on any combination of the 
following anti -diabetic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]: metformin (1 -2 grams) , insulin, GLP -1 agonists, a DPP -IV 
inhibitor , or sulfonylureas , as per their study entry dose added to Cana or placebo. As mentioned 
 
 
Canagliflozin – Sen IIS  
Protocol Version: 3.0 
Date: 12/15/2017    Page 16 of 35 
 before, patients on oral hypoglycemic other than any combination of the following anti -diabetic 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]: metformin (1 -2 grams) , insulin, GLP -1 agonists, a DPP -IV inhibitor , or sulfonylu reas 
will not be invited to join the study .  
This study is being conducted under FDA mandated guideline for use in type 2 diabetes. 
Though in this particular study Cana is referred to as the investigational drug, it is not a novel 
drug and we should not ne ed a separate IND for execution of this study.  
 
METHOD OF ASSIGNING SUBJECTS TO A TREATMENT  
Subjects, as per selection criteria below will be randomized to treatments using a permuted block 
design, developed by [CONTACT_59743][INVESTIGATOR_623] & Biostatistics Research Cor e. This approach ensures 
groups will be approximately balanced at any time during the study and at study completion. 
Randomization will be performed by [CONTACT_570963].  
 
SELECTION AND TIMING OF DOSE FOR EACH SUBJECT  
The recommended dose of Cana is [ADDRESS_749870] meal.  
 
DOSE MODIFICATIONS  
No dose modification is necessary prior to CKD stage 3B (eGFR less than 45) 
 
BLINDING / UNBLINDING  
Blinding is critical to the integrity of this clinical study. However, in the event of a medical 
emergency or pregnancy in a subject, in which knowledge of the investigational product is 
critical to the subject's management , the blind for that subject  may be broken.  
Before breaking the blind of an individual subject’s treatment, the investigator should 
have determined that the information is necessary, i.e., that it will alter the subject’s immediate 
management. In many cases, particularly when the emergency is not investigational product -
related, the problem may be properly managed by [CONTACT_570964] -blinding.  
 
END OF STUDY UNBLINDING PROTOCO L 
Upon completion of the research study, we will undergo the following protocol in order to 
unblind the research data.  
 
Unblinding  is the process by [CONTACT_570965], clinical 
staff and the trial statistician bec omes aware o f which intervention each subject enrolled in the 
research study was taking.  
Unblinding at the end of the study is required in order to make unmasked analysis in accordance 
with the study analysis plan. It is also conducted in order to inform the participants of which 
investigational product they were assigned to.  
 
Time to unblind:  
Unblinding shall be conducted when all subjects enrolled in the research study have finished 
treatment, and all follow up visits. There must be no plan to recruit any more subjects in the 
research study. Additionally, all data points and outcome measures for each research subject 
 
 
Canagliflozin – Sen IIS  
Protocol Version: 3.0 
Date: 12/15/[ADDRESS_749871] been collected, and ideally compi[INVESTIGATOR_42602]. Prior to unblinding there will be a data lock on 
clinical outcome measures and basic side outcome measures and associated  research data 
collected for the study.  
 
Procedure to unblin d 
Once data (from both the clinical and the basic science side) and has been compi[INVESTIGATOR_570941], the investigator can choose to unblind. The Princip al Investigator must contact [CONTACT_30292], and receive permission to un -blind. If, for unforeseen reason s, at the pre -determined 
date for full study unblinding  the data analysis on the cellular or basic aspects of the study is 
lagging behind the clinical data outcome measures (though the data has been acquired) the 
Principal Investigato r in consultation with the study sponsor may choose to un -blind the clinical 
outcome measures before the basic side data has been analyzed but compi[INVESTIGATOR_42602]. Upon confirmation 
from the study sponsor, the principle investigator must make a written request to the  designated 
party to unblind , hereto referred at the “ unblinder ”. The unblinder is the bio -statistician of the 
MFA, [CONTACT_570981] . Upon receipt of an instruction to unblind, the unblinder  will sign 
the request form, indicating their agreement to unblin d. This form will then be taken to the 
pharmacy, MFA’s IDS , where a member of the IDS staff will take the form, and will give the 
unblinding study binder to the unblinder.  The pharmacy will sign to indicate their release of the 
binder, and the unblinder  will sign to indicate receipt of the binder. At this point in time the chain 
of custody of the pharmacy unblended binder has been transferred to the designated party to 
unblind. The form with all of the signatures will be provided to the study coordinator to  be kept 
in the regulatory binder.  
 
5 ADVERSE EVENTS : DEFINITIONS , REPORTING , GUIDANCE  
I. Management of Safety Data  
This Study has been designated as an interventional study.  Janssen requirements for IIS 
interventional studies are all adverse events regardless of causality and special situations 
excluding those from subjects not exposed to a Janssen Medicinal Product and product quality 
complaints with or without an adverse event will be reported, once the subject has signed and 
dated an Informed Cons ent Form is obtained until the subject has completed participation in the 
study and for [ADDRESS_749872] dose of study drug.  
 
II. Definitions  
Adverse Event (AE)  
An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study subject administered a 
medicinal (investigational or non -investigational) product. An adverse event does not necessarily 
have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable 
and unintended sign (including an abnormal finding), sympto m, or disease temporally associated 
with the use of a medicinal (investigational or non - investigational) product, whether or not 
related to that medicinal (investigational or non -investigational) product. (Definition per 
International Conference on Harmon isation [ICH]).  
This includes any occurrence that is new in onset or aggravated in severity or frequency from the 
baseline condition, or abnormal results of diagnostic procedures, including laboratory test 
abnormalities.  
 
Adverse Events of Special Interest   
 
 
Canagliflozin – Sen IIS  
Protocol Version: 3.0 
Date: 12/15/2017    Page 18 of 35 
 Events that Janssen Scientific Affairs is actively monitoring as a result of a previously identified 
signal (even if non -serious).  These adverse events are:  
 
 Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)  
 Genital mycotic infection  
 Urinary tract infection  
 Osmotic diuresis -related AEs  
 Volume related AEs  
 
Individual Case Safety Report (ICSR)  
A valid ICSR must contain the four minimum criteria required to meet regulatory reporting 
requirements.  
 an identifiable subject (not disclosing the subject’s name [CONTACT_3816])  
 an identifiable reporter (investigational site)  
 a Janssen medicinal product  
 an adverse event, outcome, or certain special situation  
 
The minimum information required is:  
 suspected Janssen product (doses, indication)  
 date of therapy (start and end date, if available)  
 batch or lot number, if available  
 subject details (subject ID and country)  
 gender  
 age at AE onset  
 reporter ID  
 adverse event detail (AE verbatim in English), onset date, relatedness, causality, action 
taken, outcome, (if available)  
 Janssen protoc ol ID  
 
Product Quality Complaint (PQC)  
A product quality compliant is related to a potential quality issue during manufacturing, 
packaging, release testing, stability monitoring, dose preparation, storage or distribution of the 
product, or delivery system.   Not all PQCs involve a subject.  Lot and batch numbers are of high 
significance and need to be collected whenever available.  
 
Examples of PQC include but not limited to:  
 Functional Problem: e.g., altered delivery rate in a controlled release product  
 Phys ical Defect:  e.g. abnormal odor, broken or crushed tablets/capsules  
 Potential Dosing Device Malfunction: e.g.,  autoinjector button not working, needle 
detaching from syringe  
 Suspected Contamination  
 Suspected Counterfeit.  
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
 
 
Canagliflozin – Sen IIS  
Protocol Version: 3.0 
Date: 12/15/[ADDRESS_749873] medical occurrence that at any dose:  
 
 Results in death  
 Is life -threatening  
 (The subject was at risk of death at the time of the e vent. It does not refer to an event that 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.)  
 Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
 Is a congenit al anomaly/birth defect  
 Is a suspected transmission of any infectious agent via a medicinal product  
 Is medically important*  
 
*Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is 
also appropriate in other situation s, such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately life threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23738]. 
These sho uld usually be considered serious.  
 
NOTE: Death for ANY reason should be reported as a SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT.  
 
For reports of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], it is the sign, symptom or diagnosis which led to the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48805].  
 
Any event requiring in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063] (or the prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) must 
be reported as an SAE. Events that do not meet the criteria for SAE reporting are:  
 Reasons described in the Protocol, e.g. drug admin istration, Protocol -required testing  
 Social reasons, e.g. overnight stay because of distance between home and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]  
 Surgery or procedure planned and documented prior to entry into the Study.  
 
Any event requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_570942] a serious adverse event, except hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23741]:  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23742] (e.g., social 
reasons such as pending placement in long -term care facility)  
 Surgery or procedure planned before entry into the study. [Note: Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_570943] n ot be considered serious 
adverse events. Any adverse event that results in a prolongation of the originally planned 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23745] a new serious adverse event.]  
 
The cause of death of a subject in a study within [ADDRESS_749874] do se of study drug, whether 
or not the event is expected or associated with the study drug, is considered a serious adverse 
event.  
 
Unlisted (Unexpected) Adverse Event/Reference Safety Information  
 
 
Canagliflozin – Sen IIS  
Protocol Version: 3.0 
Date: 12/15/[ADDRESS_749875](s) with a marketing 
authorization, the expectedness of an adverse event will be determined by [CONTACT_570966].  
 
III. Special Situations  
Safety events of interest for a Janssen medicinal product that require expediting reporting and/or 
safety evaluation include, but are not limited to:  
 Drug exposure during pregnancy (maternal and paternal)  
 Overdose of a Jansse n medicinal product  
 Exposure to a Janssen medicinal product from breastfeeding  
 Suspected abuse/misuse of a Janssen medicinal product  
 Inadvertent or accidental exposure to a Janssen medicinal product  
 Any failure of expected pharmacological action (i.e., lack of effect) of a Janssen 
medicinal product  
 Medication error involving a Janssen medicinal product (with or without patient exposure 
to the Janssen medicinal product, e.g., name [CONTACT_2976])  
 Suspected transmission of any infectious agent via a medicinal  
 Unexpected therapeutic or clinical benefit from use of a Janssen medicinal product  
 
These safety events may not meet the definition of an adverse event; however, they are treated in 
the same manner as adverse events. Special situations should be recorded o n the Adverse Event 
page of the CRF.  
 
Any special situation that meets the criteria of a serious adverse event should be recorded on a 
Serious Adverse Event Report Form and be reported to Janssen Scientific Affairs within [ADDRESS_749876] be reported to Janssen Scientific Affairs by [CONTACT_513019] 24 hours of their awareness of the event  using the Serious Adverse Event 
Form. Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (e.g. spontaneo us abortion, stillbirth, and congenital 
anomaly) are considered serious adverse events and must be reported using the Serious Adverse 
Event Form.  
 
Any subject who becomes pregnant during the study must be promptly withdrawn from the study 
and discontinue further study treatment.  
 
Because the effect of the Janssen medicinal product on sperm is unknown, pregnancies in 
partners of male subjects exposed to a Janssen medicinal product will be reported by [CONTACT_513019] 24 hours of their awarene ss of the event  using the Serious Adverse Event 
Form.  Depending on local legislation this may require prior consent of the partner.  
 
Follow -up information regarding the outcome of the pregnancy and any postnatal sequelae in the 
infant will be required.

 V. Reporting Procedures for Adverse Events and Pregnancies [and/or Pregnancies in 
Partners]  
All adverse events, whether serious or non -serious, related or not related, special situations, 
pregnancy exposures and/or pregnancies in partners following exposure t o a Janssen medicinal 
product are to be documented by [CONTACT_143050]’s 
source records. Investigators must record in the CRF their opi[INVESTIGATOR_570944] a Janssen medicinal p roduct.  
All (serious and non -serious) adverse events reported for a Janssen medicinal product should be 
followed -up in accordance with clinical practice.  
 
All serious adverse events that have not resolved by [CONTACT_2054], or that have not 
resolved  upon discontinuation of the subject's participation in the study, must be followed until 
any of the following occurs:  
 The event resolves  
 The event stabilizes  
 The event returns to baseline, if a baseline value/status is available  
 The event can be attribute d to agents other than the study drug or to factors unrelated to 
study conduct  
 It becomes unlikely that any additional information can be obtained (subject or health 
care practitioner refusal to provide additional information, lost to follow -up after 
demon stration of due diligence with follow -up efforts)  
 
All serious adverse events, pregnancy exposures and/or pregnancies in partners for Janssen 
medicinal products under study should be reported directly by [CONTACT_513022], within 
[ADDRESS_749877] be reported directly by [CONTACT_513022], 
within 24 hours becoming aware , to Janssen Scientific Affair s using the Janssen Scientific 
Affair’s Serious Adverse Event Report Form.  
 
VI. Product Quality Complaints for Janssen Medicinal Products  
A PQC may have an impact on the safety and efficacy of the product. Timely, accurate, and 
complete reporting and analysis of PQC information from studies are crucial for the protection of 
patients, investigators, and Janssen Scientific Affairs , and are mandated by [CONTACT_223912]. Janssen Scientific Affairs has established procedures in conformity with regulatory 
requirements worldwide to ensure appropriate reporting of PQC information.  Lot and/or Batch 
#s shall be collected or any reports of failure of expected pharmacological action (i.e., lack of 
effect).  
 
All initial PQCs involving a Janssen product under study must be reported to Janssen Scientific 
Affairs by [CONTACT_513024] 24 hours after being made aware of the event.  
 
 
 
Canagliflozin – Sen IIS  
Protocol Version: 3.0 
Date: 12/15/[ADDRESS_749878], and as such the data shall be made available within 
a reasonable timefr ame at Janssen Scientific Affair’s request.  
 
VIII.  Transmission Methods:  
The following methods are acceptable for transmission of safety information to Janssen 
Scientific Affairs:  
 Electronically via Janssen SECURE Email service (preferred)  
 For business continuity purposes, if SECURE Email is non -functional:  
o Facsimile (fax), receipt of which is evidenced in a successful fax transmission 
report  
 Telephone (if fax is non -functional).  
 
Please use the contact [CONTACT_570967].  
 
IX. Procedures for Reporting Adverse Events (AE), Serious Adverse Events (SAE), 
Pregnancy, and Product Quality Complaints (PQC) to Janssen Scientific Affairs  
A. AEs, SAEs, Special Situations and Pregnancy Reporting.  
The Institution and t he Sponsor Investigator will transmit SAEs and Special Situations in a form 
provided by [CONTACT_513026], in 
English within 24 -hours of becoming aware of the event(s).  
 
All available clinical i nformation relevant to the evaluation of a related SAE or Special Situation 
is required.  
 The Institution and/or Sponsor Investigator are responsible for ensuring that these cases 
are complete and if not are promptly followed -up. A safety report is not cons idered 
complete until all clinical details needed to interpret the case are received. Reporting of 
follow -up information should follow the same timeline as initial reports.  
 Copi[INVESTIGATOR_570945], irrespective of association with 
the Janssen Product under study, are to be provided to Janssen Scientific Affairs using a 
transmission method in Section VIII within 24 hours of such report or cor respondence 
being sent to applicable health authorities.  
 
B. PQC Reporting  
 
 
Canagliflozin – Sen IIS  
Protocol Version: 3.0 
Date: 12/15/[ADDRESS_749879] should be quarantined  
immediately and if possible, take a pi[INVESTIGATOR_1103].  
 
X. Reconciliation of SAEs  
At a minimum, on a quarterly basis and at the end of the Study, Janssen Scientific Affairs will 
provide to the Institution and/or Sponsor Investigator, a listing of all SAEs reported to Janssen 
Scientific Affairs.  The Sponsor Investigator will review this listing and provide any 
discrepancies to Janssen Scientific Affairs.  
 
Upon request, Institution and/or Sponsor Investigator shall provide Janssen Scientific Affairs 
with a summary list of all SAEs, and AEs of Special Interest and Special Reporting Situation 
reports to date, for reconciliation purposes.  
 
XI. Dissemination of Safety Information from Janssen Scientific Affairs to 
Institution/Sponsor Investigator   
Janssen Scientific Affairs agre es to provide to the Sponsor Investigator S[LOCATION_003]R  reports for the 
Study Product as they become available until all subjects in the Protocol have completed their 
last Study visit according to the Protocol (i.e. Last Subject Last Visit has occurred).

RESEARCH STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS  
Patient Definition and Selection:   
 
 
Canagliflozin – Sen IIS  
Protocol Version: 3.0 
Date: 12/15/2017    Page 25 of 35 
 Adults aged 30-70 years will be recruited mainly from the  GWU  MFA research patient database 
provided by [CONTACT_570968], and then contact[CONTACT_570969] , from the 
endocrinology and other provider clinic s at GWU and  through referrals from the Veterans Affairs 
(VA) clinics . Suitable advertisements for the study patient enrollment will be posted. Patients will 
be included in the study if they have been diagnos ed with type 2 diabetes within the previous 1 5 
years using criteria of the American Diabetes Association22, and are currently treated with any 
combination of the following anti -diabetic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]: metformin (1 -2 grams) , insulin, GLP-1 
agonists, a DPP -IV inhibitor , or sulfonylureas . We wanted to ca pture a population where the 
subjects will be classified as having early stage of diabetes where endothelial dysfunction can be 
reversed. Late stages of diabetes may be associated with irreversible vascular damage. We plan 
to enroll subjects with HbA1C bet ween 7.0% and 10% (both inclusive) and with BMI 25 -39.9 
kg/m2 (both inclusive). Post enrollment, patients will be randomized to Cana [ADDRESS_749880] the details of the study 
described to them, and they will be given a written informed consent document to read. Then, if 
subjects consent to participate in the study, they will indicate that consent by [CONTACT_570970].  
 
Recruitment:   
Subjects will be recruited from the physician clinics a t GWU, Medical Faculty Associates, where 
[CONTACT_109202] is a clinician , as well as through referral from the VA . All patients will receive 
counseling regarding the study aims and methods.  
 
Study Design Overview:  
We propose a 2 -arm randomized, double -masked, placebo -controlled, parallel group, 
longitudinal study of 16 -weeks duration. (See study  design below), recr uited over 2  years.  The 
16 week time interval has been previously shown adequate to observe changes in endothelial 
progenitor stem cells, biochemistry and importantly, PWV changes25,26. Patients will be 
randomized to 2 groups:  
Control, (n=20), metformin , insulin or Combo  + Placebo  
Treatment, (n=20) metformin , insulin or Combo  + Cana 100mg  
 
This proposed study is based on patients wit h type 2 diabetes , who are on any combination of the 
following anti -diabetic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]: metformin (1 -2 grams) , insulin, GLP -1 agonists, a DPP -IV 
inhibitor , or sulfonylureas but still remain poorly controlled with HbA1C between 7.0% and 10% 
(both inclusive), but not overtly out of control (> 10% of HbA1C).  
Though our study is over [ADDRESS_749881] as a confounding factor on 
CD34+ cell number, function and gene expression.  
Subjects will be taking 100 mg of Cana or placebo. Dose titration of  metformin, will not 
be allowed.   Dose titration of insulin will be allowed to avoid hypoglycemia  while maintaining 
HbA1C under  10%.  
 
Most clinical studies looking at HbA1C reduction were of a much longer duration of [ADDRESS_749882] DPP -4 inhibitor studies are with animal EPCs w here comparison with human 
CD34+ population is difficult to make. In one study27 where saxagliptin was used for 12 weeks

 in drug -naïve type 2 di abetes patients there was placebo -subtracted HbA1c reduction noted of 
0.45-0.63%. It showed mean placebo -subtracted reductions in fasting serum glucose of 20 
mg/dL. From our laboratory studies of in vitro human EPC studies we do not think glucose level 
change of 20 mg/dL is significant enough to account for changes in EPC number, function and 
gene expression. However we will take the possibility of glycemia change/ reduction in 
experimental arm into account during statistical analysis of the results between  the Canagliflozin 
and placebo groups.  
 
Visits with outcome measurements  will be scheduled for the morning while overnight fasting 
(except water) to reduce diurnal variability, and clinical parameters will be obtained at scheduled 
office visits as depi[INVESTIGATOR_570946]: 
 
Week -2: Subjects will be phone screened to determine initial eligibility. If the phone -screening 
indicates possible eligibility, then the subjects will come to an in -person screening visit that same 
week (If within two weeks that is acceptable) . 
In-person screening (Week -2): Subjects will be screened and eligibility will be verified based on 
physical and laboratory tests. Equal numbers of male and female patients will be recruited.  
 
Week 0:  At this stage patients will be randomized into the study. Subjects will have the first set 
of measurements. We will make sure that patients still meet the inclusion criteria. They will be 
started on medication or placebo.  
Weeks 0, 8 and 16:  Subjects will all have the same measurements and will continue on study 
medication or placebo. All primary and secondary measures as outlined before will be carried 
out. 
 
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE  
The cellular outcome measures are as follows:  
To determine whether 4 months of Ca nagliflozin modifies CD34+ cell number, gene 
expression and function.  
 
Protocol for obtaining CD34+ cells : We will obtain a total of approximately 95  mL of peripheral 
blood per visit. Of these 95 mL, 60 -70 mL will be used to obtain CD34+ cells from mononuc lear 
cell (MNC) population and 25 -35 mL for biochemistry and plasma  ELISA assays. No samples 
will be stored for future research. MNC will be obtained from whole blood similar to protocols 
described before13,14. MNCs will be put through CD34 magnetic bead column to obtain CD34+ 
cells (Mi ltenyi Biotec). Purity of CD34+ cells, post sort, usually is above 90%, to be verified by 
[CONTACT_53409].  
A. From Mononuclear (MNC) population (pre CD34+ magnetic column sorting): MNC cells 
(prior to CD34 magnetic bead sorting) will be also used to assay CFU H ill Colony 
forming unit (Stem Cell Technologies - Cat#[ZIP_CODE]) media for Colony Forming unit 
(CFU) Assay. CFU will be counted on [ADDRESS_749883] plating (from initial plating).  
B. From CD 34+ cell population (Post Sorting):  
a. Migration Assay using SDF1Alpha concent rations of 0, 10, 100ng/ml and VEGF -
A concentrations of 20 and 50 ng/ml, using 150,000 cells in 300ul serum free cell 
suspension media per insert.

Protocol Version: 3.0 
Date: 12/15/2017    Page 27 of 35 
 b. Gene expression studies. Genes to be assessed on sorted CD34 positive cells:  
i. Endothelial lineage cell surfac e markers: CD34, VEGFR2 (KDR), CD31, 
CD144  
ii. For Anti -oxidant gene expression: Superoxide dismutase (SOD) 1, [ADDRESS_749884]: p53, p21, Bcl2, caspase -3 
iv. Endothelial Function Assay Gene: endothelial Nitric Oxide Sy nthase, von -
Willebrand’s Factor  
v. Genes associated with progenitor cell chemotaxis: VEGF -A, SDF1 alpha, 
CXCR4.  
 
SECONDARY OBJECTIVE  
To determine whether use of Canagliflozin alters other cardio -metabolic health indicator 
parameters such as: arterial stiffness measures, resting metabolic rate, body composition 
measures, hs -CRP, IL -6, TNF -alpha (inflammatory markers), fasting lipid profi le, levels of 
insulin, glucose appetite controlling hormones and urine levels of microalubumin 
(Microalbumin/Creatinine ratio). . 
 
We expect to corroborate our findings of Aim 1 (cellular outcome measures) with traditional 
markers of endothelial/ vascular f unction such as serum biochemistry and arterial stiffness.  
A. Effect of Cana on Serum Biochemistry  & Urine :  
a. Looking at inflammation, apoptosis and anti -oxidant protein levels: Highly 
selective C -reactive protein (hs -CRP), IL -1, IL -6, TNF -alpha, MCP -1 , fasting 
glucose,  comprehensive metabolic panel,  insulin and lipid profile.  
b. Plasma  SDF1 alpha (ELISA) and GLP -1 (ELISA) will be estimated to assess 
endothelial health and factors that may influence CD34+ cell chemotaxis  
c. Estimation of Creat inine Clearance a nd proteinuria: 24hr urinary protein estimation 
and creatinine clearance (obtained via micro -albumin/creatinine ratio from a spot 
urine sample).  
i. Optional sub -study to investigate urine exosomes. See page 31. 
d. The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) will be estimated using the CKD -EPI 
(Chronic Kidney Disease Epi[INVESTIGATOR_10444]) equation. The CKD -EPI 
[INVESTIGATOR_10908], expressed as a single equation, i s: 
GFR = 141 X min (Scr/κ,1)α X max(Scr/κ,1)-1.209 X 0.993Age X 1.018 [if 
female] X 1.159 [if black]; where Scr is serum creatinine (mg/dL), κ is 
0.7 for females and 0.9 for males, α is –0.329 for females and –0.411 for 
males, min indicates the minimum of Scr/κ or 1, and max indicate s the 
maximum of Scr/κ or 117. 
 
B. Effect of Cana on Body Habitus (Determination of body composition and visceral 
fat) AND Resting Metabolic Rate.   
a. Height and weight will be measured and the body mass index (BMI=kg•m -2) 
used as an indicator of relative weight. The body composition scale  calculates 
body fat% and total body water% in addition to BMI.  
 
 
Canagliflozin – Sen IIS  
Protocol Version: 3.0 
Date: 12/15/2017    Page 28 of 35 
 b. We also intend to follow Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR): at weeks 0, [ADDRESS_749885] calometric measurements of basal metabolic rate will be obtained using 
machine obtained from Korrs Medical.  This is a noninvasive procedure. We plan 
to measure the oxygen that the body consumes.  It will help us calculate a 
patient’s Resting Energy Expenditure (REE), commonly referred to as a Resting 
Metabolic Rate (RMR).   As our protocol is directed to overwe ight and obese 
individuals using incretin therapy, it will be beneficial to note if the treatment 
modifies RMR. Description: The machine ReeVue by [CONTACT_570971].   The patient breathes 
throug h a simple mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_570947].   Because there is a direct correlation between oxygen consumed and 
calories burned (4.813 calories for every milliliter of oxygen consumed), an 
accurate measurement of oxygen consumpti on is an effective measurement of 
calorie consumption. The machine uses a one -way valve in the disposable 
(MetaBreather) mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959].   This draws in fresh room air with each inspi[INVESTIGATOR_570948].   The disposab le 
mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_570949]. It is un -necessary to clean the equipment or the 
tubings between each patient. This equipment is FDA approved and has been used 
in physician offices as an oxygen uptake test with  associated CPT code #9469027. 
Other related tria ls have shown weight loss but effect on metabolic rate has not 
been studied18. 
C. Effect of Cana on  Assays of Arterial Stiffness :  
a. We will acquire Pulse wave analysis and Vascular Flow using SphygmoCor CP 
system from ATCOR as a measure of central arterial pressure and art erial 
stiffness. Again SGLT2 inhibitors have been shown to reduce systolic blood 
pressure but effect on stiffness has not been looked at, except with 
Empagliflozin17,18. 
b. We also intend to acquire Pulse wave analysis and Vascular Flow using 
SphygmoCor CP system from ATCOR to measure central arterial pressure and 
arterial stiffnesss28,29,30,31,32. The secondary mea sures are indirect measures of 
endothelial inflammation in ea rly type 2 diabetes patients11,12,19,33,34.  
D. Other Measures:  
a. Urine pregnancy testing for women of child bearing potential . 
b. Creatinine Clearance and proteinuria estimation (obtained via micro -
albumin/creatinine ratio from a spot urine sample).    
 
STUDY MATERIALS  
Janssen , manufacturers of Cana is expected to provide Cana at no cost for this study.  
 
SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
Study drug toxicities will be assessed continuously. Adverse events will be evaluated on a 
continuous basis while the patient is on study and until [ADDRESS_749886] recovered to baseline 
or are deemed irreversible by [CONTACT_458].

 7 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
Sandri et al. (2005, Study A, patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease) found that in the 
control group, CD34+ cells increased from 372 cells per mL blood at baseline (SD 156) to 402 
(SD 183) at 4 weeks. In their exercise training group, the increase was from 458 (SD 252) at 
baseline to 2977 (SD 852) at 4 -weeks.  We created a simulated data set with th ese parameters in 
order to calculate the percent of CD34+ cell variation that was explained by [CONTACT_48990] x time 
interaction. We tested two random effects mixed models, one without and the other with, a group 
x time interaction (group is treatment vs contro l; time is pre vs. [ADDRESS_749887]). The percent 
variance explained = (Vno -int – Vint)/Vno -int, where Vno -int is the residual covariance 
parameter estimate without a group x time interaction term in the model, and Vint is the residual 
covariance parameter est imate with a group x time interaction term in the model. We found that 
based on the baseline and [ADDRESS_749888] deviation of CD34+ cell concentrations 
reported by [CONTACT_570972]. (2005), the interaction explained 84.5% of the variance in CD34+ cell  
concentration (a very large effect size). The correlation among repeated measures was r=.62. 
Using these parameters in G -Power3 (version 3.1.3), with 2 groups measured at 2 time points, in 
order to achieve power >.95 would require a total sample size of 6  subjects (3 per group) each 
measured at 2 time points. Assuming 25% subject loss, we would need to start with 4 per group. 
If the group x time interaction explained only 50% of the variance in CD34+ cell count (still a 
large effect), we would need total s ample size of 8 (4 per group) in order to achieve power >.95. 
In order to account for possible 25% drop -out, 6 -8 per group should be randomized.  
In Sen et al. (2015), in a sample of patients with pre -diabetes (n=11), CD34+ cell number 
increased from 0.8 ( SEM 0.1) before exercise, to 1.4 (SEM 0.2) after exercise, a pre -post effect 
size (Cohen’s d) of 1.81.  In order to detect an effect of this size using a [ADDRESS_749889], 
with alpha=.05, for power >.80, >.90, and >.95, the number of subjects require d would be 5, 6, or 
7, respectively.   
However the two quoted studies quoted above are very different from our proposed study on 
patients’ with established endothelial dysfunction entit y such as diabetes. It is well known 
(Werner et al, Ref No. 11) that di abetes can affect CD34+ number and function, therefore in our 
proposed study, number of CD34+ cell availability may be a limiting factor. Therefore we 
propose to use double the number suggested by [CONTACT_570973] 8x2=16 patients per 
group so that  CD34+ cell based end -point studies are not compromised.  
DATA ANALYSIS  
Digital data files will be stored in a protected limited -access folder on the MFA network. Only 
the Study Biostatistician and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_570950] t his server. 
The data file will have random subject identifiers and will have no HIPAA identifiers.  
 
The distributional assumptions of all measures will be examined. Means and standard deviations 
will be computed for continuous measures and proportions for categorical variables. Graphical 
representations of the mean group slopes and individual slopes will  be generated and inspected.

Protocol Version: 3.0

 Study groups will be compared to determine whether any imbalance between the groups on 
patient characteristics remain after randomization.  If imbalance is evident, by [CONTACT_122317], all 
models will be adjusted for the unbalanced  covariates.  Change in outcome over time will be 
examined using a multilevel approach with linear mixed models (LMM)35,36.  The longitudinal 
multilevel modeling approach will enable us to examine characteristics of within -person change, 
as well as between -group differences that may influence change.  LMMs handle missing data 
more efficiently than traditional ANOVA designs. In the linear mixed models, the patient is 
considered a random effect and the outcome measured at specific time points is nested within 
patient. Time (week 0, 8, 16)  will be modeled as a continuous variable  in order to assess linear 
effects from 0 to 8 to 16 weeks. In order to determine whether there are non -linear time effects 
(e.g., rapid increase from 0 to 8 weeks followed by [CONTACT_570974] 8 to 16 weeks; or initial 
decrease at 8 weeks followed by [CONTACT_570975] 16 weeks, etc.) we will also need to include models 
in which time is defined as a class variable (with 0 as the reference group). Subsequent  analyses 
will add study group and oth er patient characteristics as covariates. We are particularly interested 
in whether there is a significant interaction between study group and time, adjusting for other 
patient level covariates.  A significant interaction would indicate that the slopes in outcome over 
time differ by [CONTACT_2060].  If the global test of interaction is significant, subsequent significance 
testing of the pair wise comparisons of group slopes group will be adjusted for multiple 
comparisons.  The model also includes coefficients for the group -by-time interactions and 
random effects for patient and time.  
 
𝑌𝑖𝑗= 𝛽0+ 𝛽1𝑇𝑖𝑚 𝑒𝑖𝑗+ 𝛽2𝐺𝑟𝑜𝑢 𝑝𝑖+ 𝛽3(𝑇𝑖𝑚 𝑒𝑖𝑗 𝑥 𝐺𝑟𝑜𝑢 𝑝𝑖)++ 𝜀𝑖𝑗 
 
The interaction between GROUP and TIME will be modeled in a similar fashion using two 
additional indicator variables.   The above multivariable model enables us to adjust for time -
varying covariates, such as glucose.  Since glucose will be measured contemporaneously with 
the outcomes at each visit, however, causal interpretations of glucose and  any outcome are 
suspect.  As such, we will consider glucose as a nuisance covariate, and consider any relationship 
between glucose and an outcome as merely associative.

8. APPENDIX A: OPTIONAL URINE EXOSOME STUDY, 
Veterans Affairs, [CONTACT_570982]  
A urine sample is already required as a part of [CONTACT_109202]’s Canagliflozin protocol. This urine will 
be used for urine pregnancy tests (if applicable), and labcorp tests for microalbum in/creatinine 
ratio. There will be excess urine.  
  
Subjects will have the option to opt in or out of a research study being conducted  by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Eric 
Nylen of the VA, in which the  urine will undergo a urine exosome analysis.  
 
Purpose of this Study:  Exosomes  are cell -derived vesicles that are present in many and perhaps 
all biological fluids, including blood, urine, and cultured medium of cell cultures. The reported 
diameter of  exosomes  is between 30 and 100 nm, which is larger than LDL, but much smaller 
than for example, red blood cells . Exosomes are either released from the cell when  
multivesicular bodies  fuse with the  plasma membrane  or they are released directly from the 
plasma membrane.[3] Evidence is accumulating that exosomes have specialized functions and 
play a key role in, for example,  coagulation , intercellular signaling, and waste 
management.[1] Consequently, there is a growing interest in the clinical applications of 
exosomes.  Exosomes can potentially be used for prognosis, therapy, and biomarkers for health 
and disease. In this study we are particularly interested in exosomes released from podocytes as a 
marker of podocyte function and podocyte inflammation. Podocytes are ofte n considered a 
modified endothelium and one of its more commonly used parameter is microalbuminuria.  
In this study we are using urine exosomes as an added parameter of kidney function other than 
microalb uminuria and GFR calculation.  
 
The procedure for this  study is as follows:  
10-50 mL of the fresh spot urine is placed into a urine cup containing 1 tab of cOmplete Ultra - 
protease inhibitor cocktail ([COMPANY_002]) for exosome analysis performed at the Veterans Affairs  (VA) 
Maryland Health Care System .  
The s pecime n can be refrigerated at 4ºC for ~ 1 week , frozen at -80C, or processed immediately. 
Transfer to the VA  will be done following appropriate procedures outlined in the MFA -VA 
Materials Transfer Agreement (MTA). The urine will be  processed for exosomes as follows :  
 
The supernatant may be subjected to ultracentrifugation, with final centrifugation at 200,000g for 
2 hr at 4ºC to obtain the urinary exosome pellet. The pellet would then be tested for exosomes 
markers, namely CD63, CD 9, CD81, Hsp70, and WT -1, nephrin and podocalyxin, using o ne of 
two methods. Preferably m RNA will be extracted and then RT -PCR will be run. Alternative 
analysis will be done using gel electrophoresis followed by [CONTACT_570976].   
 
Method 1:  Urine exosome mRNA extraction  
mRNA extraction from exosomes will be accomplished by [CONTACT_570977] (Norgen 
Biotek Corp., Catalog # [ZIP_CODE]). Thereafter, a pre -amplification step will take place, this i s a 
 
 
Canagliflozin – Sen IIS  
Protocol Version: 3.0 
Date: 12/15/[ADDRESS_749890] been collected.  
 
Method 2 : Gel electrophoresis and Western blot  
Exosome pellet will be dissolved in Laemli buffer and proteins will be resolved by [CONTACT_570978] (4 -12% polyacrylamide gel) under denaturing conditions. Subsequently, proteins 
will be trans ferred to a PVDF membrane by [CONTACT_570979] a dry blotting method (iBlot). 
The blot will be incubated with blocking solution for 1h, and subsequently exposed to a solution 
with the first antibody overnight, at 4ºC. After washing (5 x 5 min), the me mbrane will be 
exposed to a secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase [HRP] -conjugated) for 1h at room 
temperature. Finally, the membrane will be incubated with an HRP substrate reagent to reveal 
the proteins bound to the antibodies tested. Quantitative a nalysis will be performed by 
[CONTACT_570980].  
 
End-point:  Exploratory but in conjunction with urine albumin/creatinine ratio will help to 
establish impact of Linagliptin on renal function in diabetes related CKD population.

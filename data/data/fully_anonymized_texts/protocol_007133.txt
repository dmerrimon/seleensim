DX-2930
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930- 04 Final: 14 December 2015
Confidential Page 4of 92 Dyax Corp.Study Design:
This study  is an open- label, long term safet y and efficacy  study  to evaluat e DX -2930 in 
preventing acute angioedema attacks in patients with Ty pe I and Ty pe II HAE. There are two 
types of subjects who will be enrolled into this study :
1.Subjects who rollover from the DX-2930-03 study
2.Subjects who were not participants in DX-2930- 03.
Roll- over Subjects:
Rollover subjects are subjects who complete the double- blind treatment period at Day  [ADDRESS_1185610] DX -2930- 04 visit for rollover subjects (Day  0) will occur on the same day  as the 
DX-2930-
[ADDRESS_1185611] DX- 2930 -04 visit 
(Day 0) wi ll be duplicated. Results of the final DX -2930-[ADDRESS_1185612] not to may not enroll 
in 
DX-2930-04 
at a later time .
All subjects, caregivers, Investigators and site personnel will remain blinded to the 
DX
-2930- 03 treatment assignment until the conclusion of the DX -2930- 04 study .
Non-rollover subjects:
Up to [ADDRESS_1185613] wait until 
enrollment for the double -blind study  has ended before they  can screen for DX -2930- 04. The 
Sponsor may  ease this restriction based on the enrollment rate observed in DX -2930-
03.
Screening Period:
There is no screening period for rollover subjects.
Non-rollover subjects must provide informed consent and have screenin g assessments 
completed within [ADDRESS_1185614] open -label dose.  Screened non -rollover subjects 
who are on long- term prophy lactic (LTP) therapy  for HAE are required to undergo a 
minimum [ADDRESS_1185615] open- label 
DX-2930
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930- 04 Final: 14 December 2015
Confidential Page 5of 92 Dyax Corp.dose.
Treatment Period:
Rollover Subjects: Following informed consent and pre -dose assessments, rollover subjects 
will r eceive a single open -label dose of 300 mg DX- 2930 administered subcutaneousl y (SC).    
Subjects will not receive any  additional DX -[ADDRESS_1185616] be conducted at the investigative site: pregnancy  testing, clinical laboratory  testing, 
physical examination, 12-Lead ECG, QOL , PK, PD and anti -drug antibody sample 
collection.  All other scheduled study  visits may  be conducted via site check -in calls to 
collect information on adverse events, concomitant therap y, and HAE attack data .  Refer to 
the Appendix [ADDRESS_1185617] and site schedules 
allow.  If the second dose is to be administered within the accepted ±[ADDRESS_1185618] alr eady  attended the Day  42 visit, then this Day 46 visit will be 
considered an acceptable, extra study  visit.
In the scenario that the second dose is to be administered outside of theaccepted ±[ADDRESS_1185619] -dosing. As with all study  visits, information will be collected on 
adverse events, concomitant therap y, and HAE attack data. 
Subsequent doses after dose 2 require a minimum of 1 0days and maximum of 1 8days 
between administrations, and should fall within the accepted ±4 day  window around study  
DX-2930
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930- 04 Final: [ADDRESS_1185620] dose should be 
administered between Day 52 and Day  55, which would ensure both a dosing interval 
within 10 to 18 day s from the second dose and a visit within the ±[ADDRESS_1185621] 
dose an d 
a visit within the ±[ADDRESS_1185622]’s first HAE attack occurs, there will be a minimum of [ADDRESS_1185623]’s 
second dose, but will not exceed [ADDRESS_1185624] visit at which a
dose may  be administered. 
Non-rollover Subjects: Once al l screening assessments have been completed, eligibility  
confirmed and LTP washout completed (if applicable), non -rollover subjects will arrive at 
the study  site and, following pre -dose assessments, receive an open -label dose of [ADDRESS_1185625] dose administered at 
the Day  168 study visit .
Follow -up Period:
After completion of the 26 -week treatment period, all subjects will undergo safet y 
evaluations during an 8-week follow -up period unless rolling over into an other ongoing 
DX-2930 clinical study  or access program that permits such a rollover.
Modifications to Open -Label Dosing :
If,at an y time ,an important dose -related safety signal is identified either from this study  or 
DX-2930- 03, the Sponsor may  decide to switch the enrolled subjects who have not y et 
completed the treatment period, and an y subsequent subjects, to receive a different open -
label DX -2930 dose and/or frequency .
In addition, b ased on the results of the DX -2930- 03 study , the Sponsor may switch to a 
different dose and/or frequency . 
Study Population:
The study  is expected to enroll subjects from the DX -2930- [ADDRESS_1185626] 1 attack per 12 weeks. HAE diagnosis will be confirmed through 
documented clinical history  and diagnostic testing conducted either during screening or 
during prior participation in study  DX-2930- 02 or DX -2930-03.  The study  will aim to enroll 
DX-2930
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930- 04 Final: [ADDRESS_1185627] 10 subjects who are 12 to 17 years of age, inc lusive of subjects 12 to 17 y ears old 
who roll over from the DX -2930- 03 study .
Criteria for Inclusion:
Subjects must meet the following criteria to be enrolled in this study :

that confirm HAE Ty pe I or II: C1 inhibitor (C1- INH) functional level < 40% of 
the normal level. Subjects with functional C1 -INH level 40- 50% of the normal 
level may  be enrolled if they  also have a C4 level bel ow the normal range.  
Subjects may  be retested if results are incongruent with clinical history  or 
believed b y the Investigator to be confounded b y recent LTP use.

the following medically  acceptable forms of contraception from the screening period 
through 30 days after t he final study  visit: progestin- only oral contraceptive, condom 
with or without spermicidal jelly, diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicidal jelly , or 
intra-uterine device (IUD, all ty pes). A female whose male partner has had a 
vasectom y must agree to use one additional form of medicall y acceptable 
contraception.
Females of non- childbearing potential, defined as surgically  sterile (status post 
hysterectom y, bilateral oophorectom y, or bilateral tubal ligation) or post- menopausal

result of Gilbert’s S yndrome).
9.Pregnancy  or breastfeeding.
10.Subject has an y condition that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_852660], may  
compromise their safety  or compliance, preclude successful conduct of the study , or 
interfere with interpretation of the results (e.g., history  of substance abuse or dependence, 
a significant pre -existing illness or other major comorbidity  that the Investigator 
considers may  confound the interpretation of study  results).
Test Product; Dose; and Mode of Administration:
DX-2930 is a sterile, preservative -free solution for injection, pH 6.0. The active ingredient, 
DX-2930, is formulated using the following compendial components:  30 mM sodium 
phosphate dibasic dih ydrate , 19.6 mM citric acid, 50 mM histidine, 90 mM sodium chloride, 
0.01% Poly sorbate 80. Each open -label vial contains a nominal concentration of [ADDRESS_1185629] will receive a total of 2 mL, which will be 
administered in a single 2 mL  SC injection. The injection will be given in the upper arm, 
thigh or abdomen.
Duration of Treatment:
All subjects wi ll receive open -label DX -[ADDRESS_1185630] dose of open -label DX -2930 administered to these subjects 
DX-2930
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930- 04 Final: [ADDRESS_1185631] dose administered on Day  0 and the final 
dose administered at the Day 168 study  visit .
There will be a ± 4-day wind ow around each stud y visit. There will be a minimum of [ADDRESS_1185632] -dose.
Duration of Study for Individual Subjects:
Following informed consent, subjects will either rollover from DX -2930-03 or undergo 
screening assessments (non-rollover subjects). Screening assessments for non-rollover 
subjects must occur within [ADDRESS_1185633] open- label dose. Eligible subjects will be 
enrolled and undergo a 26-week treatment period. At the conclusion of the 26- week 
treatment period, subjects will be followed for an additional 8 weeks unless rolling over into 
another ongoing DX -2930 clinical study  or access program that permits such a rollover.
Prohibited Concomitant Treatments:
Use of the following treatments will not be permitted during the stud y:
•Long -term prophy laxis for HAE (e.g., use of C1 -INH for long -term prophylaxis, 
attenuated androgens, or anti -fibrinoly tics).
•Angiotensin- converting enzy me (ACE) inhibitors.
•Estrogen -containing medications with sy stemic absorption (such as oral contraceptives or 
hormonal replacement ther apy).
•Androgens (e.g., stanozolol, danazol, oxandrolone, methy ltestosterone, testosterone).
•Any other investigational drug or device.
The use of short -term prophy lactic treatment for HAE will be permitted if medically  
indicated.  Short -term prophy laxis is defined as C1- INH, attenuated androgens, or anti -
fibrinoly tics used to avoid angioedema complications from medicall y indicated procedures.
Management of Acute Attacks:
Acute HAE attacks during the stud y are to be managed in accord with the Investigator’s 
usual care of their patients, including use of acute attack therapi[INVESTIGATOR_852661]. Use of C1- INH will be permitted as an acute attack therap y 
but not as a long- term prophy lactic therap y.
Safety Assessments:
Safety  assessments will include the following:
•Adverse events (AEs), including serious adverse events (SAEs) and adverse events of 
special interest (AESI). SAEs and AESI will be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours 
of becoming aware of the event.
•Vital signs, including sitting or supi[INVESTIGATOR_9204] (BP), heart rate (HR), body  
temperature, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_2842] (RR)
•Physical examination

Confidential Page 10of 92 Dyax Corp.•Clinical laboratory  testing (hematology , serum chemistry , coagulation and urinaly sis)
•12-Lead electrocardiogram (ECG)
Adverse events of special interest (AESI) will be captured and monitored during this study . 
Hypersensitivity  reactions and events of disordered coagulation will be considered AESI.
Pharmacokinetic (PK) Assessments:
Blood samples will be collected for the measurement of plasma DX-2930 concentrations.
Pharmacodynamic (PD) Assessments:
Blood samples will be collected to evaluate the pharmacod ynamic effects of DX -2930 
through biomarker assays.
Immunogenicity Assessments:
Blood samples will be collected to as say for the presence of anti-drug antibodies, including 
evaluation of neutralizing antibodies (if an y confirmed positive anti- drug antibodies are 
detected).
C1-INH, C1q and C4 Assessments:
Samples will be obtained for C1 -INH, C4, and C1q assay s at screeni ng for non -rollover 
subject eligibility  assessment.
Quality of Life Assessments:
Quality  of life (QOL) assessments will be conducted using the EQ5D , SF-36and the 
Angioedema Quality  of Life Questionnaire (AEQoL ).
Collection of HAE Attack Data:
The collec tion, reporting and assessment of attacks in this study  will be done in accordance 
with the HAE Attack Assessment and Reporting Procedures (HAARP) . Refer to Appendix 4 .  
Site personnel will be trained on HAARP prior to screening and enrolling subjects at t heir 
site.
Site personnel will train subjects and caregivers on identify ing s ymptoms of an attack, the 
requirements for reporting attacks and the information they  will be expected to provide.  The 
patient (and caregiver) will confirm their understanding of what is required of them for 
reporting attacks to the site.
At screening, HAE attack history  will be collected for non- rollover subjects. I nformation 
collected will include any prior history  of lary ngeal attacks, attack frequency , average 
severit y, predom inant attack location(s), average duration, acute attack therapy  use and 
history  of long -term prophy laxis.
During the study , subjects (or caregivers) will be instructed to notify  and report details to the 
study  site within [ADDRESS_1185634] in tracking any  HAE attacks experienced. 
DX-2930
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930- 04 Final: 14 December 2015
Confidential Page 11of 92 Dyax Corp.Subjects (or caregivers) will be asked to provide the following information when reporting an 
attack:
Date and time s ymptoms of an attack were first experienced
Description of s ymptoms experienced, including location(s)
Impact on activit y and whether an y assistance or medical intervention was required, 
including hospi[INVESTIGATOR_852662]
Any medications used to treat the attack
If the attack resolved, date and time the subject was no longer ex periencing sy mptoms
Site personnel will review the information provided and solicit additional information as 
necessary  to document the attack, as described in HAARP.
Site personnel will contact [CONTACT_852737]  [ADDRESS_1185635]- reported and 
Investigator / phy sician designee -confirmed HAE attacks will be recorded in the eCRF. 
Emergency  department visits for HAE attacks and HAE attacks resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_852663].
To be confirmed as an attack, the event must have symptoms or signs consistent with an 
attack in at least one of the following locations: 
•Peripheral angioedema: cutaneous swelling involving an extremity , the face, neck, torso, 
and/or genitourinary  region
DX-2930
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930- 04 Final: 14 December 2015
Confidential Page 12of 92 Dyax Corp.•Abdominal angioedema: abdominal pain, with or without abdominal distention, nausea, 
vomiting, or diarrhea
•Lary ngeal angi oedema: stridor, dy spnea, difficult y speaking, difficult y swallowing, throat 
tightening, or swelling of the tongue, palate, uvula, or lary nx
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_852664] s ymptoms, the investigator or ph ysician designee may  still 
clinically  determine that the event did not represent an attack if there are features that 
strongl y refute such a diagnosis. For example, the reported event is accompanied b y 
symptoms that are not consistent with an HAE attack (e.g., urticaria), the reported event 
persists well bey ond the ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_852665] (e.g., greater than 7 day s), or 
there is a likel y alternate etiology for the event (e.g., the subject’s abdominal sy mptoms are 
attributable to a viral gastroenteritis outbreak in the household). 
To be counted a s a unique attack distinct from the previous attack, the new sy mptoms must 
occur at least 24 hours after resolution of the prior attack’s s ymptoms.
Study Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1869]:
Safety  data, including SAEs and AESI, will be monitored regularl y throughout the duration 
of the study . If any potential safet y signal is identified as a result of monitoring in this study, 
or from an y safet y findings from the DX -2930- 03 study , the Sponsor may  take actions as 
deemed appropriate, including suspending further dosing, while the potential risk is 
evaluated and a course of action has been determined.
Individual Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1869]:
Dosing for an y individual subject will be discontinued if the subject experiences a 
DX-2930- related SAE (or a DX -2930- related, clinically  significant non-serious AE) that, in 
the assessment of the Investigator, warrants discontinuation from further dosing for that 
subject’s well -being. The I nvestigator has the ability  to contact [CONTACT_852738]. Subjects will continue to be followed through the completion of all 
scheduled non- dosing visits , unless they  request to be discontinued from the study .

Addit ional Measures:
•Anti- drug antibody  development
•Pharmacokinetics (PK) 
•Pharmacod ynamic (PD) effects
•Quality  of Life Assessments
Analysis Populations:
Theanalysis population will be based on subjects who receive at least one dose of DX-2930 
after entering the study .
Sample Size Determination:
No formal sample size calculation was performed.  The sample size is not based on an y 
statistical considerations.  This study  is designed to evaluate the safet y and efficacy  of open-
label treatment with DX -2930 in subjects who participated in DX -2930- 03 and individuals 
who were not otherwise able to participate in DX -2930-03.
Statistical Methodology:  
The distribution of time from first open -label dose to first HAE attack will be determined for 
rollover subjects. The estimation will be based on a standard Cox proportional hazards model 
where several baseline covariates will be tested including baseline attack rate prior to 
entering DX -2930- 03, the treatment arm in DX -[ADDRESS_1185640] attack will be adjusted for an y significant baseline (p <0.05) 
covariates, and b y examining the distribution separatel y by [CONTACT_852739] -2930- 03. In this survival analy sis, one observation (time to first attack) per 
subject will be generated.
For other efficacy  endpoints, mean event rates will be assessed for all subjects ([ADDRESS_1185641] -
second dose to Day 182 for rollover subjects; Day  14 to Day  182 for non-rollover subjects).
In addition, for rollover subjects, the mean change from the documented values in 
DX-2930- 03 at baseline (last measurement prior to randomization into DX -2930- 03) and 
entry  (last measurement in DX -
2930- 03 prior to enrollment into DX -2930- 04) will be 
compared to the values assessed at DX -2930- 04 time points from 14 day s after the second

weeks, 150 mg DX -2930 every  4 weeks). For each time period, graphs will be constructed 
for mean changes in efficacy  variables from baseline. Time periods will be defined as 
relative time from the DX -2930- 03 baseline for those who participated.
For non -rollover subjects, efficacy  variables wi ll be presented as descriptive statistics only .
For disposition, demographic and safety  anal yses, subjects will be represented in the 
reporting as follows:
Subjects who received 26 weeks of 300 mg DX -2930 every  2 weeks in DX
-2930-03 
and up to 26 weeks of DX-2930 treatment in DX -2930-04.
Subjects who received 26 weeks of 300 mg DX -2930 every  4 weeks in DX-
2930-03 
and up to 26 weeks of DX -2930 treatment in DX -2930-04.
Subjects who received 26 weeks of 150 mg DX -2930 every  4 weeks in DX
-2930-
03 
and up to 26 w eeks of DX -2930 treatment in DX -2930-04.
Subjects who received 26 weeks of placebo in DX
-2930- 03 and up to 26 weeks of 
DX
-2930 treatment in DX -2930-04.
Subjects who received up to 26 weeks of DX -2930 treatment in DX -
2930-04.
Data from the start of DX
-2930 
treatment through the final treatment period study visit (up to 
52 weeks for subjects whose treatment with DX -2930 was initiated in DX -2930- 03) will be 
combined for safet y evaluation of the overall DX -
2930 exposure.
Safety Analysis:
All Subjects:
Safety  measures include AEs, concomitant medications, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs 
(blood pressure, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_2842], and body temperature), phy sical examination 
findings, and ECGs.
Treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) are defined as AEs with onse t at the time of or following 
the start of treatment with DX -2930, or medical conditions present prior to the start of 
treatment but increasing in severity or relationship at the time of or following the start of 
treatment. The number and percentage of sub jects with TEAEs will be display ed by  [CONTACT_852740] 
(MedDRA®). Summaries in terms of severit y and relationship to DX -2930 will also be 
provided. SAEs will be summarized separatel y in a similar fashion. Patient listings of AEs 
causing discontinuation of DX -2930 treatment, AEs resulting in death, SAEs and AESI will 
be produced.
DX-2930
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930- 04 Final: 14 December 2015
Confidential Page 15of 92 Dyax Corp.AESI  will be anal yzed according to primary  System Organ Classes (SOCs) and Preferred 
Terms (PTs) determined by  [CONTACT_852741] (SMQs). 
Summary  tables with SOCs and PTs, from the SMQ searches, will be generated 
presenting the number and percentage of subjects by  [CONTACT_117795], severit y, seriousness, and 
relationship to study  medication.
Usage of concomitant medications (other than rescue medications) will be summarized 
descriptivel y.
Actual values and change from Day  [ADDRESS_1185642] withdrawals will be summarized.
Rollover Subjects: Adverse events that started during subject participation in DX -2930-[ADDRESS_1185643] open -label dose in DX -2930-04 and then subsequently  
reappeared in DX -2930- 04 will be counted as a new TEAE in DX -2930- 04.
The incidence of AEs in DX-2930- 04 from each DX -2930-
03 treatment group (300 mg 
DX-2930 every  2 weeks vs. 300 mg DX- 2930 every  4 weeks vs. 150mg DX -2930 every  4 
weeks vs placebo) as well as evaluation of overall AEs in the combined group of all rollover 
subjects will be assessed.  Changes from baseline (last measurement prior to the firs t dose of 
DX-2930 received, regardless of if it occurred in DX -
2930- 03 or DX -2930-04
) to the 
DX-2930- 04 time points for phy sical examination results, vital sign parameters, and clinical 
laboratory  parameters will be summarized by  [CONTACT_304727]-2930- 03 treatment group and for the 
combined group of all rollover subjects.
Non-rollover Subjects: Adverse events will be captured from the time of informed consent 
through the final study  visit.  Adverse event tabular summaries will be based on all 
treatment -emergent AEs

1.1 DX-2930
DX-2930 is a full y human IgG1 recombinant monoclonal antibody that binds specificall y to 
active plasma kallikrein. DX -2930 is being developed for proph ylactic treatment of 
angioedema attacks in patients with hereditary  angioedema (HAE) , a serious and 
life-threatening disease.
1.2 Hereditary  Angioedema
HAE is a long -term, debilitating, and life- threatening disease caused by  [CONTACT_439081] 
C1-inhibitor (C1- INH) gene, resulting in deficiency  or dy sfunction of C1 -INH protein. HAE 
manifests cl inically  as unpredictable, intermittent attacks of subcutaneous or submucosal 
edema of the face, lary nx, gastrointestinal tract, limbs and/or genitalia ( Zuraw, 2008). 
Swelling may  last up to five or more days; most patients suffer multiple attacks per y ear. 
HAE is an orphan disorder. The exact prevalence of HAE is unknown, but current estimates 
range from [ADDRESS_1185663] estimate (By[CONTACT_281998], 2009 ; Goring et al., 1998 ; Lei et al., 2011 ; 
Nordenfelt et al., 2014 ; [COMPANY_002] et al., 2005 ). 
Swelling in the lary nx can obstruct the airway s and cause death from asphyxiation (Bork et 
al., 2012 ; Bork et al., 2000 ). Approximately  50% of all HAE patients will experience a 
laryngeal attack in their lifetime, and there is no way  to predict which patients are at risk of a 
laryngeal attack (Bork et al., 2003 ; Bork et al., 2006 ). 
Abdominal attacks are often associated with nausea, vomiting, and severe pain; intestinal 
symptoms resembling abdominal emergencies may  lead to unnecessary  surgery  (Zuraw, 
2008)
. 
Approximately  85% of patients have Ty pe I HAE, characterized b y ver y low production of 
functionally  normal C1 -INH protein, while the remaining approximately  15% of pati ents 
have T ype II HAE and produce normal or elevated levels of a functionally  impaired C1 -INH 
(Zuraw, 2008 ). In patients with Ty pes I and II HAE, uncontrolled plasma kallikrein 
generation results in excess brad ykinin release from high -molecular weight kininogen 
(HMWK) and vascular leak mediated b y brad ykinin binding to the B2 receptor (B2 -R) on the 
surface of endothelial cells (Zuraw, 2008) . Clinical suspi[INVESTIGATOR_852667] I and II HAE can be 
confirmed b y available blood tests. In addition to abnormalities in C1- INH level and 
function, plasma C4 levels are markedly  reduced at all times in blood from most patients.
1.3 Therapeutic Rationale for DX-
2930
Plasma kallikrein play s a critical role in the pathogenesis of HAE attacks ( Davis, 2006; 
Kaplan and Joseph, 2010) . In normal ph ysiology , C1-INH regulates the activity  of plasma 
kallikrein as well as a variety  of other protea ses, such as C1r, C1s, factor XIa, and factor 
XIIa. Plasma kallikrein regulates the release of brady kinin from HMWK. Due to a deficiency  
DX-2930
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930- 04 Final: 14 December 2015
Confidential Page 28of 92 Dyax Corp.of C1- INH in HAE, uncontrolled plasma kallikrein activity  occurs and leads to the excessive 
generation of brad ykinin. B radykinin is a vasodilator which is thought to be responsible for 
the characteristic HAE sy mptoms of localized swelling, inflammation, and pain (Craig et al., 
2012; Zuraw et al., 2013) . Intervening at the level of brady kinin production with a plasma 
kallikrein inhibitor therefore represents an attractive and rational therapeutic strategy  for 
HAE. Indeed, the im portance of plasma kallikrein as a drug target in HAE has been validated 
through the observed effectiveness of Kalbitor®(ecallantide), a peptide that specifically  
targets plasma kallikrein, which was approved b y the FDA for the treatment of acute HAE 
attacks ( Kalbitor®Package Insert, 2015). 
DX-2930 is a highly  potent and specific inhibitor of plasma kallikrein (K i = 125 pM). X -ray 
crystallograph y of DX- 2930 combined with plasma kallikrein demonstrates DX -2930 
binding to the active site of kallikrein (Kenniston et al., 2014 ).
1.[ADDRESS_1185664] -in-human study  with DX -2930 in health y 
subjects did not identify  any safet y concerns. Single doses up to 3 mg/kg of DX
-2930 were 
well-tolerated. There were no dose -limiting toxicities, serious adverse e vents, or any  other 
safet y concerns identified.
Pharmacokinetic (PK) data from the Phase 1a (DX-2930- 01) and Phase 1b (DX -2930- 02) 
clinical stud ies in conjunction with data from the nonclinical toxicity  studies support a wide 
safet y margin. The mean C maxfor human subjects treated at a dose of 300 mg on Day s 1 and 
15 was approximately  27g/mL. As comparison, a mean C maxof 744 g/mL was observed 
following dosing of monkey s with 50 mg/kg DX -2930 subcutaneous (SC) weekl y for 6 
months resulting in a safety
 margin of approximately  28-fold. No toxicologically  significant 
findings were observed in these treated animals or in any  other nonclinical toxicity  study  to 
date forsystemically  administered DX -
2930.
Safety  data is also available from the Phase 1b study  (DX -2930- 02), a multiple -ascending 
dose study  in HAE patients. I n this study , two doses of DX-
2930 up to 400 mg administered 
14 day s apart were well -tolerated. There were no dose -limiting toxicities, serious adverse 
events in an y DX -2930 treated subjects, or any  other safety  concerns identified in this study  
of HAE patients. Pharmacokinetic data from the 1b study  found that the drug exposure 
following two administrations of DX
-2930 (up to a maximum of 400 mg) was substantially  
less than that attained and ev aluated in the nonclinical toxicity  studies.

Confidential Page 29of 92 Dyax Corp.1.6 DX-2930 Clinical Data
The clinical development program to date for DX -2930 consists of 2 studies to evaluate the 
safet y, tolerabilit y, and PK of DX -2930, including one completed Phase 1a single -ascending 
dose study  in healthy  subjects and a Phase 1b multiple -ascending dose study  in HAE 
patients. These studies are summarized in the following sections.
1.6.1 Single -Ascending Dose Study in Healthy Su bjects (DX -2930 -01)
DX-2930- 01 was a Phase 1a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study  in health y 
subjects to evaluate the safet y, tolerability, and PK following a single, SC dose of DX -2930. 
Participating subjects were randomized to receive placebo or active stud y drug within one of 
the following sequential, ascending dose cohorts: 0.1, 0.3, 1.0, or 3.0 mg/kg. For each dosing 
cohort, 6 subjects were randomized to receive active drug and 2 subjects to receive placebo. 
A total of 32 subjects enrolled in the study  and were randomized. The treatment groups were 
well balanced for demographic characteristics. The actual dose of DX- 2930 administered to 
subjects ranged from 6.2 mg (in the 0.1 mg/kg group) to 300 mg (in the 3.0 mg/kg group) 
across all cohorts.
Based on the safety  anal ysis, a single administration of DX -2930 was well tolerated up to 
doses of 3.0 mg/kg without evidence of dose- limiting toxicity . There were no deaths, SAEs, 
or subject discontinuations due to adverse events (AEs) during the st udy. Furthermore, there 
was no significant imbalance between placebo and DX- 2930 for any  particular treatment-
emergent adverse event (TEAE). The most commonly  reported TEAE was headache, which 
occurred at a rate of 25% for both DX -[ADDRESS_1185665] of DX -2930 in humans. 
For additional detail regarding the single dose, clinical study  in healthy  subjects, please refer 
to the DX- 2930 Investigator’s Brochure .
1.6.2 Multiple- Ascending Dose Study in HAE Patients (DX -2930 -02)
DX-2930-02 was a Phase 1b rand omized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, multiple 
ascending -dose study  in patients with HAE to evaluate safet y, tolerability , and PK of SC 
DX-2930. Participating subjects were randomized 2:1 to receive either active study  drug or 
placebo within one of the following sequential, ascending dose cohorts: 30, 100, 300, or 
400 mg (nominal 6 subjects per cohort). Each subject received [ADDRESS_1185666] to follow -up for reasons not relate d to the study . 
DX-2930
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930- 04 Final: [ADDRESS_1185667] demographics were balanced in terms of age, race, ethnicity  and BMI . There were 
slightly  more females in the DX-2930 group than in the placebo group (66.7% versus 
53.8%). 
The most common AEs reported were HAE attacks, injection site pain, and headache. The 
rates were not appreciably higher in the DX -[ADDRESS_1185668] 
(30 mg) with injection site pain lasting [ADDRESS_1185669] (400 mg) 
with worsening headache lasting 1 minute and night sweats.
No safet y signals were ide ntified for vital signs, physical examinations, clinical laboratory  
tests, or electrocardiograms (ECG). Results suggested DX-[ADDRESS_1185670] -dose samples (3.3%), obtained from 2 out of 23 subjects (8.7%), 
were confirmed to be anti -drug antibody -positive. No samples were positive for neutralizing 
activity .
The pharmacokinetic analy sis for all subjects in the 30, 100, 300 and 400 mg doses showed
drug levels in HAE subjects were dose- dependent and exhibited a prolonged half -life of 
approximately  2 weeks, ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_12340] a human monoclonal antibody . Cmaxdrug levels increased 
with increasing dose, as expected. These parameters were consistent with value s obtained in 
healthy  subjects in study  DX-2930-01.
A Western blot assay  showed pre -dose baseline levels of mean 2- chain HMWK in 
unactivated plasma collected from HAE patients was approximately  50%. A statistically  
significant reduction in [ADDRESS_1185671] 2 attacks in the 3 months prior to study entry  
(0.15 attacks/week). Of those subjects treated with 300 or 400 mg DX -2930, 15 of 
16 subjects met these criteria. Of the placebo treated subjects, 11 of 13 subjects met these 
criteria. 
The baseline HAE attack rates (attacks/week) were 0.39 attacks per week in the placebo 
group, 0.33 attacks per week in the 300 mg group, 0.55 attacks per w eek in the 400 mg group 
and 0.49 attacks per week in the 300 and 400 mg combined group. During the pre -specified, 
primary  efficacy  interval of 6 weeks (from day s 8 to 50; corresponding to a period of notable 
drug exposure), the HAE attack rate, adjusted fo r baseline attack rate, was 0 in the 300 mg 
group and 0.045 attacks per week in the 400 mg group, compared to 0.37 attacks per week in 
DX-2930
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930- 04 Final: 14 December 2015
Confidential Page 31of 92 Dyax Corp.the placebo group. This resulted in a 100% reduction vs placebo for the 300 mg DX-2930 
group ( P< 0.0001) and an 88% redu ction vs placebo for 400 mg DX -2930 ( P= 0.005). 
During this primary  efficacy  interval, 100% of subjects in the 300 mg group ( P= 0.026) and 
82% of subjects in the 400 mg group ( P= 0.03) were attack -free compared with 27% of 
subjects in the placebo group.
The data from this study  demonstrated proof of concept of the abilit y of DX- [ADDRESS_1185672] on plasma kallikrein activity  in patient pla sma.

multi
-center, double -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled parallel -arm study  (DX -2930- 03) 
evaluating the efficacy  of DX -2930 in preventing acute angioedema attacks in patients with 
Type I or T ype II HAE.  Further information on the DX -2930- 03 study  design can be found 
in Appendix 5 .
Subjects who complete the DX
-2930-
03 treatment period will be offered the option of rolling 
into the open -label extension study , DX-2930
-04.  A limited number of individuals with 
HAE T ype I or T ype II who were not enrolled in DX -2930- 03 (up to 50) will be also 
enrolled. 
The rationale for this open -label extension study  is to evaluate the long term safet y and 
efficacy  of repeated treatment with DX-2930.  For subjects rolling over from DX- 2930 who 
were randomized to one of the active study  arms, the duration of exposure will cover 1 full 
year.  For rollover subjects randomized to placebo in DX -2930- 03, and for non- rollover 
subjects, the duration o f exposure will cover 6 months.  Combined, the overall exposure 
between DX -2930- 03 and DX -
2930- 04 provide a sizable dataset to evaluate DX -2930 as a 
life-long, chronic treatment for preventing acute attacks of HAE.  
This study  also seeks to characterize the outer bounds of DX-
2930 dosing frequency  
(possibly  beyond 2 to 4 weeks) 
by [CONTACT_852743] ’s 
first open- label dose and their first reported HAE attack .  Additionally , this study  will assess
the immunogenicit y of D X

3.1 Overall Study  Design and Plan
3.1.1 Overview
This study  is an open- label, long term safet y and efficacy  study  to evaluate DX -2930 in 
preventing acute angioedema attacks in patients with Ty pe I and Ty pe II HAE. There are two 
types of subjects who will be enrolled into this study :
1.Subjects who rollover from the DX-2930-03 study .
2.Subjects who were not participants in DX -2930- 03.
Roll- over Subjects:
Rollover subjects are subjects who complete the double- blind treatment period at Day  [ADDRESS_1185675] DX -2930- 04 visit for rollov
er subjects (Day  0) will occur on the same day  as the 
DX-2930-[ADDRESS_1185676] DX- 2930 -04 visit 
(Day 0) will be duplicated.  Results of the final DX -2930-[ADDRESS_1185677] not to may not enroll in 
DX-2930- 04 at a later time .
All subjects, caregivers, Investigators and site personnel will remain blinded to the 
DX
-2930- 03 treatment assignment until the conclusion of the DX -2930- 04 study .
Non-rollover subjects :
Up to [ADDRESS_1185678] wait until 
enrollment for the double -blind study  has ended before they can screen for DX -2930- 04. The 
Sponsor may  ease this restriction based on the enrollment rate observed in DX -2930-
03.
Screening Period:
There is no screening period for rollover subjects.
Non-rollover subjects must provide informed consent and have screening assessments 
completed within [ADDRESS_1185679] open -label dose.  Screened non -rollover subjects 
who are on long- term prophy lactic (LTP) therapy  for HAE are required to underg o a 
DX-2930
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930- 04 Final: [ADDRESS_1185680] open- label 
dose.
Treatment Period:
Rollover Subjects: Followi ng informed consent and pre -dose assessments, rollover subjects 
will receive a single open -label dose of 300 mg DX- 2930 administered subcutaneousl y (SC). 
Subjects will not receive any  additional DX -[ADDRESS_1185681] be conducted at the investigative site: pregnancy  testing, clinical laboratory  testing, 
physical examination, 12-Lead ECG, QOL, PK, PD and anti -drug antibody sample 
collection.  All other scheduled study  visits may  be conducted via sit e check -in calls to 
collect information on adverse events, concomitant therap y, and HAE attack data .  Refer to 
Appendix [ADDRESS_1185682] and site schedules 
allow.  If the second dose is to be administered within the accepted ± [ADDRESS_1185683] alread y attended the Day 42 visit, then this Day  46 visit will be 
considered an acceptable, extra study  visit.
In the scenario that the second dose is to be administered outside of the accepted ±[ADDRESS_1185684] will undergo pre -dose assessments for vital signs, phy sical

Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930- 04 Final: [ADDRESS_1185685] -dosing. As with all study  visits, information will be collected on 
adverse events, concomitant therap y, and HAE attack data.
Subsequent doses after dose 2 require a minimum of 1 0 day s and maximum of 18 days 
between administrations, and should fall within the accepted ± [ADDRESS_1185686] dose should be 
administered between Day 52 and Day  55, which would ensure both a dosing interval 
within 10 to 18 day s from the second dose and a visit within the ±[ADDRESS_1185687] 
dose and a visit within the ±[ADDRESS_1185688]’s first HAE attack occurs, there will be a minimum of [ADDRESS_1185689]’s 
second dose, but will not exceed [ADDRESS_1185690] visit at which a 
dose may be administered .
Non-rollover Subjects: Once all screening assessments have been completed, eligibility  
confirmed and LTP washout completed (if applicable), non -rollover subjects will arrive at 
the study  site and, following pre -dose assessments, receive an open -label dose of [ADDRESS_1185691] dose a dministered at 
the Day  168 study  visit.
Follow -up Period
:
After completion of the 26 -week treatment period, all subjects will undergo safet y 
evaluations during an 8 -week follow -up period unless rolling over into an other ongoing 
DX-2930 clinical study  or ac cess program that permits such a rollover. Figure 1shows a 
schematic of the open -label extension study .

Modifications to Open -Label Dosing :
If at an y time an important dose- related safet y signal is identified either from this study  or 
DX-2930- 03, the Sponsor may  decide to switch the enrolled subjects who have not y et 
completed the treatment period, and an y subsequent subjects, to receive a different open -
label DX -2930 dose and/or frequency .
In addition, b ased on the results of the DX -2930- 03 study , the Sponsor may switch to a 
different dose and/or frequency .
3.1.2 Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1869]
[IP_ADDRESS] Study Level Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_852668], including SAEs and AESI, will be monitored regularl y throughout the duration 
of the study . If any potential safet y signal is identified as a result of monitoring in this study, 
or from an y safet y findings from the DX -2930- 03 study , the Sponsor may  take actions as 

DX-2930
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930- 04 Final: 14 December 2015

evaluated and a course of action has been determined.
[IP_ADDRESS] Individual Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_852669] y individual subject will be discontinued if the subject experiences a 
DX-2930- related SAE (or a DX -2930- related, clinically  significant non -serious AE) that, in 
the assessment of the Investigator, warrants discontinuation from further dosing for that 
subject’s well -being. The I nvestigator has the ability  to contact [CONTACT_852738]. Subjects wil l continue to be followed through the completion of all 
scheduled non- dosing visits, unless they  request to be discontinued from the study .
3.1.3 Follow -up for Subjects Meeting Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_852670] (AE, 
laboratory , phy sical examination, vital sign, or ECG finding) will be carefully  monitored 
until resolution, which may  include the following:
•Additional clinical laboratory  tests and/or other clinical investigations
•Additional visit s or extended duration of follow -up
•Obtaining a specialist consultation
3.2 Rationale for Open -Label Extension Dose Selection
The dose selected for the open- label extension (300 mg every  2 weeks) is anticipated to be 
effective and safe as determined in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_22735], double -blind DX -2930- [ADDRESS_1185692] not y et completed the treatment 
period, and a ny subsequent subjects, to receive a different open- label DX -2930 dose and/or

DX-2930
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930- 04 Final: 14 December 2015
Confidential Page 38of 92 Dyax Corp.3.4 Stud y Duration for Individual Subjects
Following informed consent, subjects will either rollover from DX -2930-03 or undergo 
screening assessments (non-rollover subjects). Screening assessments for non- rollover 
subjects must occur within [ADDRESS_1185695] open- label dose. Eligible subjects will be 
enrolled and undergo a 26-week treatment period. At the conclusion of the 26- week 
treatment period, subjects will be followed fo r an additional 8 weeks unless rolling over into 
another ongoing DX -2930 clinical study  or access program that permits such a rollover.
DX-2930
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930- 04 Final: [ADDRESS_1185696] angioedema has been reported in HAE patients as 
young as the age of 3 (Bork et al., 2003 ). In one case series of [ADDRESS_1185697]  angioedema by  [CONTACT_14898] 18 ( Farkas, 2010
). 
Animportant unmet medical need exists among children with HAE, especially  adolescents, 
since the disease commonly  worsens after pubert y (Bennett and Craig, 2015 ; Zuraw, 2008).  
The study  will aim to enroll at least [ADDRESS_1185698] meet the following criteria to be enrolled in this study :
1.Male and female HAE subjects who are 12 years of age or older at the time of screening. 
2.Documented diagnosis of disease HAE (Ty pe I or II) based on all of the following:
Documented cli nical history  consistent with HAE (subcutaneous or mucosal, 
nonpruritic swelling epi[INVESTIGATOR_852659]).
Diagnostic testing results obtained during screening (or a prior DX -2930 study ) 
that confirm HAE Ty pe I or II: C1 inhibitor (C1- INH) functional level < 40% of 
the normal level. Subjects with functional C1 -INH level 40- 50% of the normal 
level may  be enrolled if they  also have a C4 level below the normal range.  
Subjects may  be retested if results are incongruent with clinical history  or 
believed b y the Investigator to be confounded b y LPT use. 
At least one of the following: Age at reported onset of first angioedema s ymptoms 
≤[ADDRESS_1185699] 1 attack per 12 weeks.
4.Adult subjects and caregivers of subjects under the age of 18 are willing and able to read, 
understand, and sign an informed consent form.  Subjects age 12 to 17, whose caregiver 
DX-2930
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930- 04 Final: [ADDRESS_1185700] adhere to contraception 
requirements for the duration of the study  as follows:
Females of childbearing potential must agree to be abstinent or else use any  two of 
the following medically  acceptable forms of contraception from the screening period 
through 30 days after the final study  visit: progestin- only oral contraceptive, condom 
with or without spermicidal jelly , diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicidal jelly , or 
intra-uterine device (IUD, all ty pes). A female whose male partner has had a 
vasectom y must agree to use one additional form of medicall y acceptable 
contraception.
Females of non- childbearing potential, defined as su rgically  sterile (status post 
hysterectom y, bilateral oophorectom y, or bilateral tubal ligation) or post- menopausal 
for at least 12 months do not require contraception during the stud y.
Males, including males who are surgicall y sterile (post vasectom y), wi th female 
partners of childbearing potential must agree to be abstinent or else use a medically  
acceptable form of contraception from the screening period through 60 days after the 
final study visit. 
4.3 Exclusion Criteria
Subjects who meet an y of the following criteria will be excluded from the study :
1.Discontinued from DX -2930 -03 after enrollment for any  reason.
2.If rolling over from DX -2930- 03, presence of important safet y concerns that would 
preclude participation in this study .
3.Concomitant diagnosis of another form of chronic, recurrent angioedema such as 
acquired angioedema (AAE), HAE with normal C1- INH (also known as HAE Ty pe III), 
idiopathic angioedema, or recurrent angioedema associated with urticaria.
4.Dosing with an investigational drug (not incl uding DX
-2930) or exposure to an 
investigational device within 4 weeks prior screening.
5.Exposure to angiotensin -converting enzy me (ACE) inhibitors or any  estrogen -containing 
medications with sy stemic absorption (such as oral contraceptives or hormonal 
replacement therap y) within 4 weeks prior to screening.

the start of the treatment period (Day  0).  Short -term prophy laxis is defined as C1- INH, 
attenuated androgens, or anti -fibrinoly tics used to avoid angioedema complications from 
medically  indicated procedure s.
8.Any of the following liver function test abnormalities: alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 
> 3x upper limit of normal, or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) > 3x upper limit of

5.1 Description of Trea tment(s)
For detailed information regarding open- label DX -2930 administration, refer to the 
Pharmacy  Manual.
DX-2930 is a sterile, preservative -free solution for injection, pH 6.0. The active ingredient, 
DX-2930, is formulated using the following compendia l components:  30 mM sodium 
phosphate dibasic dih ydrate , 19.6 mM citric acid, 50 mM histidine, 90 mM sodium chloride, 
0.01% Poly sorbate 80. Each open label vial contains a nominal concentration of [ADDRESS_1185701]’s second dose, but will not exceed [ADDRESS_1185702] dose administered at the Day  168 study  visit.
After completion of the 26 -week treatment period, all subjects will undergo safet y 
evaluations during an 8 -week follow -up period unless rolling over into an other ongoing 
DX-2930 clinical study  or access program that permits such a rollover.

6.3 Demographics and Medical History
Demographics: date of birth (alternately  age or year of birth, if full date is not allowed to be
collected for legal reasons), sex,  race and ethnicity (where locall y permitted) and medical 
history  will be obtained at Screening from subjects not rolling over from DX -2930- [ADDRESS_1185711]’s current medical status (current disease processes), past medical status (past disease 
processes), history  of surgery , allergies and concomitant medications. For subjects rolling 
over from DX -2930- 03, these data will be carried forward f rom that study . 
6.4 HAE Attack Information Collection
The collection, reporting and assessment of attacks in this study  will be done in accordance 
with the HAE Attack Assessment and Reporting Procedures (HAARP).  Site personnel will 
be trained on HAARP prior to screening and enrolling subjects at their site.
Site personnel will train subjects and caregivers on identify ing s ymptoms of an attack, the 
requirements for reporting attacks and the information they  will be expected to provide.  The 
patient (and caregi ver) will confirm their understanding of what is required of them for 
reporting attacks to the site.
At screening, HAE attack history  will be collected for non- rollover subjects. I nformation 
collected will include any prior history  of lary ngeal attacks, at tack frequency , average 
DX-2930
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930- 04 Final: 14 December 2015
Confidential Page 46of 92 Dyax Corp.severit y, predominant attack location(s), average duration, acute attack therap y use and 
history  of long -term prophy laxis.
During the study , subjects (or caregivers) will be instructed to notify  and report details to the 
study  site within [ADDRESS_1185712] in tracking any  HAE attacks experienced. 
Subjects (or caregivers) will be asked to provide the following in formation when reporting an 
attack:
Date and time s ymptoms of an attack were first experienced
Description of s ymptoms experienced, including location(s)
Impact on activit y and whether an y assistance or medical intervention was required, 
including hospi[INVESTIGATOR_852675]
Any medications used to treat the attack
If the attack resolved, date and time the subject was no longer experiencing sy mptoms
Site personnel will review the information provided and solicit additional information as
necessary  to document the attack, as described in HAARP.
Site personnel will contact [CONTACT_852737]  [ADDRESS_1185713] -reported attack not confirmed b y the Investigator or 
DX-2930
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930- 04 Final: [ADDRESS_1185714]- reported and 
Investigator / phy sician designee -confirmed HAE attacks will be recorded in the eCRF. 
Emergency  department visits for HAE attacks and HAE attacks resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_852663].
To be confirmed as an attack, the event must have symptoms or signs consistent with an 
attack in at least one of the following locations: 
•Peripheral angioedema: cutaneous swelling involving an extremity , the face, neck, torso,
and/or genitourinary  region
•Abdominal angioedema: abdominal pain, with or without abdominal distention, nausea, 
vomiting, or diarrhea
•Lary ngeal angioedema: stridor, dy spnea, difficult y speaking, difficult y swallowing, throat 
tightening, or swelling of the tongue, palate, uvula, or lary nx
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_852664] s ymptoms, the investigator or ph ysician designee may  still 
clinically  determine that the event did not represent an attack if there are features that 
strongl y refute such a diagnosis. For example, the reported event is accompanied b y 
symptoms that are not consistent with an HAE attack (e.g., urticaria), the reported event 
persists well bey ond the ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_852665] (e.g., greater than 7 day s), or 
there is a likel y alternate e tiology  for the event (e.g., the subject’s abdominal sy mptoms are 
attributable to a viral gastroenteritis outbreak in the household). 
To be counted as a unique attack distinct from the previous attack, the new sy mptoms must 
occur at least 24 hours after r esolution of the prior attack’s s ymptoms.
6.5 Vital Signs
Vital signs will be assessed by [CONTACT_21438]/her qualified designee according to the 
Study  Activities Schedule ( Appendix 1 ). Routine vital sign assessments will be taken with

6.7 Electrocardiography  (ECG)
A standard 12- lead ECG (single recording) will be performed according to the Study  
Activities Schedule ( Appendix 1 ). The date and time of each ECG and its results will be 
documented in the source documents and eCRF. Electrocardiograms will be sent to a central 
reading vendor for assessment.  For subjects who rollover from DX -2930- 03, the ECG taken 
during the final study  visit in DX -2930- 03 will serve as the Day  0 pre -dose ECG in this study  
and will not be duplicated.
6.8 Clinical Laboratory  Tests
6.8.1 Laboratory Parameters
Laboratory  testing will be performed according to the Study  Activities Sched ule
(Appendix 1).

6.15.1 Definitions
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event
An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a c linical trial subject whether or not it 
appears to have a causal relationship with the treatment administered. 
An AE can therefore be any  unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or disease temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal 
product or participation in a clinical study , whether or not directl y related to the medicinal 
product or stud y participation.
•AEs may be new events or may  be pre -existing conditions that have become aggravated 
or have worsened in severity  or frequency  during the course of the study .
•AEs may  be clinicall y significant changes from baseline in physical examination, 
laboratory  tests, or other diagnostic investigation (e.g., laboratory  results, x- ray findings).
Laboratory  abnormalit ies generall y are not considered AEs unless they
 are associated with 
clinical signs or s ymptoms, or require medical intervention. A clinicall y significant 
laboratory  abnormality  that is independent from a known underl ying medical condition and 
that require s medical or surgical intervention, or leads to DX -[ADDRESS_1185721] or are part of a known underly ing medical condition are not, in 
themse lves, AEs; rather, the underl ying medical condition leading to the abnormalities would 
be reported as the AE.
DX-2930
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930- 04 Final: 14 December 2015
Confidential Page 53of 92 Dyax Corp.Pregnancy  is not an AE; however, if a female subject becomes pregnant during the conduct 
of the study , the Investigator must notify the Sponsor ac cording to the procedures provided in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS].
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious Adverse Event
A SAE is any  adverse experience occurring at any dose that results in any  of the following 
outcomes:
•Death
•Life-threatening experience; Note: “Life -threatening” refers to a situation in which the 
subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that 
might have caused death if it were more severe.
•Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]; Note: Does 
not include hospi[INVESTIGATOR_852676] 24 hours. A scheduled 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a pre-existing condition that has not worsened during participation in 
the study  does not meet this criterion. Pre -planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_852677]/surgical procedure or routine check -ups do not meet this criterion.
•Results in persistent or significant disability  or incapacit y.
•Is a congenital anomal y or birth defect.
•Is considered to be an important medical event defined as those that may  not be 
immediately  life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may  jeopardize the 
subject or may  require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition 
above.
[IP_ADDRESS] Overdose
An overdose is defined as a significant variation from the recommended/scheduled dosage 
for a product. The dosing for this study  will be conducted in a controlled clinical setting and 
an overdose is not anticipated. However, in the event of an accident, for this study , an 
overdose of DX -[ADDRESS_1185722].
[IP_ADDRESS] Planned Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]
A hospi[INVESTIGATOR_852678]- label DX -[ADDRESS_1185723]’s medical history  is considered complete. However, if the 
event/condition worsens during the trial, it must be reported as an AE.
[IP_ADDRESS] Treatment -Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE)
An AE is treatment -
emergent if the onset time is after first administration of open -label 
DX-[ADDRESS_1185724] 
DX-2930 administration, the AE increases in severity  during the open
-label treatment period.
DX-2930

DX-2930-[ADDRESS_1185726] open- label dose in DX -2930- 04, and then 
subsequently  reappeared in DX -2930- 04 will be counted as a new TEAE in DX -
2930-04.
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI)
Adverse events of special interest (AESI) will be captured and monitored during this study . 
Investigators will report all AESI to Dyax, regardless of causality, using the same 
timelines as described for SAE reporting. The following describe the AESI  and the criteria 
for reporting AESI . 
HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS
As hy persensitivity  reactions have been observed for monoclonal antibodies as a class, these 
events are considered AESI  for this study . Investigators will report all diagnoses, or signs and 
symptoms when diagnoses cannot be determined, that are consistent with hy persensitivity  
reactions, regardless of causality , within 24 hours from the time of study
 drug administration. 
Investigators will report hy persensitivity  reactions that occur after 24 hours, only ifthe 
reactions are suspected to be related to study drug.
EVENTS OF DISORDERED COAGULATION
Bleeding AESI
Athough aPTT prolongation due to plasma kallikrein inhibition is an artifactual in vitro
phenomenon, as a precautionary  measure in evaluating the safet y of DX- 2930, bleeding 
events will be reported as A ESI for this study . Investigators will report all diagnoses, or signs 
and sy mptoms when diagnoses cannot be determined, that are consistent with a clinical event 
of bleeding. Coagulation testing (aPTT, PT, INR) should be performed when possible, and 
when t emporall y reasonable, with any reports of bleeding or for clinical conditions possibly  
indicative of bleeding.
Hypercoagulable AESI
Investigators will report all diagnoses, or signs and sy mptoms when diagnoses cannot be 
determined, that are consistent with a thrombotic or embolic etiology . 
6.15.2 Monitoring
[IP_ADDRESS] Monitoring of Adverse Events
Each subject will be monitored for the occurrence of AEs, including SAEs and AESI, from 
signing of the ICF through the final follow- up visit.
DX-2930
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930- 04 Final: 14 December 2015
Confidential Page 55of 92 Dyax Corp.•Subjects will be questioned and/or examined by  [CONTACT_29517] a qualified designee 
for evidence of AEs. The questioning of subjects with regard to the possible occurrence 
of AEs will be generalized such as, "How have you been feeling since your last visit?”  
The presence or absence of specific AEs should not be elicited from subjects.
•Subjects having TEAEs will be monitored until resolution with relevant clinical 
assessments and laboratory  tests, as determined by [CONTACT_737].
•AEs, actions taken as a result of AEs, and follow -up res ults must be recorded in the eCRF 
as well as in the subject's source documentation. Follow -up laboratory  results should be 
filed with the subject's source documentation.
For an y SAEs or AEs that require the subject to be discontinued from dosing, relevant
clinical assessments and laboratory  tests will be repeated as clinically  appropriate, until final 
resolution or stabilization of the event(s). Subjects will continue to be followed through 
completion of all scheduled visits.
[IP_ADDRESS] Monitoring of Safety Laboratory Assessments
All safet y laboratory  assessments will be performed at a central laboratory . The clinical 
laboratory  values will be reported to the Investigator who will review them for clinical 
significance and consideration of abnormal values as potential AEs.
6.15.3 Assessment of Adverse Events
[IP_ADDRESS] Assessment of Severity
The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity  (severit y) of a specific event (as in 
mild, moderate, or severe my ocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may  be of 
relativel y minor medical significance (such as severe nausea). This is not the same as 
“serious,” which is based on subject/event outcome or action criteria usually  associated with 
events that pose a threat to a subject’s life or functioning.
In this stud y, the severity of AEs will be assessed according to Division of Microbiology  and 
Infectious Diseases (DMID) Adult Toxicity  Table, Draft, November 2007 (US National 
Institutes of Health: National I nstitute of Allergy  and Infectious Diseases) ( Appendix 2 ) and 
the Division o f Microbiology  and Infectious Diseases (DMID) Pediatric Toxicity  Table, 
Draft, November 2007 (US National Institutes of Health: National Institute of Allergy and 
Infectious Diseases) ( Appendix 3 ). For abnormalities not specificall y found in the Toxicity  
Tables, the following general scale will be used to estimate grade of severity:
•GRADE 1 (Mild): Transient or mild discomfort ; no medical intervention/therap y 
required
•GRADE 2 (Moderate): Mild to moderate limitation in activity  -some assistance may  be 
neede d; no or minimal medical intervention/therapy  required
•GRADE 3 (Severe): Marked limitation in activity , some assistance usuall y required; 
medical intervention/therapy  required, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_852679]-2930
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930- 04 Final: 14 December 2015
Confidential Page 56of 92 Dyax Corp.•GRADE 4 (Life -threatening): Extreme limitation in ac tivity , significant assistance 
required; significant medical intervention/therap y required, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_852680] -emergent ECG abnormality  that is considered by  [CONTACT_852746] y 
significant and requiring inte rvention/therap y will be assessed as a severe AE.
[IP_ADDRESS] Assessment of Causality
A medicall y qualified Investigator must assess the relationship of an y AE (including SAEs) 
to the use of DX -2930, as related or not related, based on clinical judgment and using all 
available information, and may  include consideration of the following factors:
•Possible alternative causes of the AE, including the disease under treatment, pre -existing 
conditions, concomitant use of other drugs, and presence of environmental or genetic 
factors.
•The temporal association between DX -2930 exposure and onset of the AE.
•Whether the manifestations of the AE are consistent with known actions or toxicity  of 
DX-2930.
•The AE resolved or improved with decreasing the dose or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_852681] -2930 
(dechallenge). Judgment should be used if multiple products are discontinued at the same 
time.
The causal relationship between DX- 2930 and the AE will be assessed using one of the 
following categories:
Not Related:   Factors consistent with an assessment of Not Related include:
Temporal relationship is lacking (e.g., the event did not occur within a 
reasonable time frame following administration of DX -2930); or
Other causative factors more likely explain the event (e .g., a pre -existing 
condition, other concomitant treatments).
Related:   Factors consistent with an assessment of Related include:
There is a positive temporal relationship (e.g., the event occurred within a 
reasonable time frame following administration of DX-2930); or
The AE is more likel y explained by [CONTACT_852747] -2930 than b y 
another cause (i.e., the AE shows a pattern consistent with previous 
knowledge of DX -2930 or the class of DX -2930).
[IP_ADDRESS] Assessment of Clinical Significance
Clinical significance of individual AEs will be determined by  [CONTACT_737], with 
discussion with the Medical Monitor as appropriate.
DX-2930
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930- 04 Final: 14 December 2015
Confidential Page 57of 92 Dyax Corp.6.15.4 Clinical Laboratory Adverse Events
Laboratory  abnormalities generall y are not considered AEs unless they are associated with 
clinical signs or symptoms, or require medical intervention. A clinicall y significant 
laboratory  abnormality  that is independent from a known underl ying medical condition and 
that requires medical or surgical intervention, or leads to DX- 2930 treatment interruption or 
discontinuation, will be considered an AE.
When laboratory  abnormalities are considered to be AEs, the DMID Adult Toxicity  Table 
(Appendix 2 ) or DMID Pediatric Toxicity Tables ( Appendix 3 ) will be used to assess 
severit y. Where discrepancies in the upper limit of normal (ULN) and lower limit of normal 
(LLN) of laboratory  ranges occur between those included in the DMID tables and those of 
the laboratory  that performs the assay s, the values provided by  [CONTACT_852748] y grade. Clinical significance of individual laboratory  AEs will be 
determined b y the Investigator with input from the Medical Monitor as needed. 
Following is an exception to defining clinically  significant, abnormal laboratory  values as 
AEs:
APTT prolongation in the absence of an y associated bleeding or other evidence of 
clinical relevance will not be considered a clinically  significant laboratory  abnormality  or 
AE. In the appropriate physiologic setting, such as IV heparin therap y, aPTT can be used 
to monitor bleeding risk. However, as noted in the Investigators Brochure, aPTT 
prolongation due to plasma kallikrein inhibition is an artifactual in vitro phenomenon. 
Although plasma kallikrein drives fibrin formation in the aPTT assay , plasma 
kallikrein -driven coag ulation does not appear to have hemostatic or other phy siologicall y 
important functions in vivo . It is well documented that, in humans, deficiency of factor 
XII or prekallikrein (and thus plasma kallikrein) is not associated with abnormal 
bleeding, either spontaneous or during surgical procedures ( Renne and Gruber, 2012 ). 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_852682], deficiency  of eit her protein is associated with marked 
prolongation of the aPTT.

•Cancer
The Investigator is to report any  expedited safet y observations from the list above to Dy ax 
using the SAE Reporting Form in the EDC system within [ADDRESS_1185727]'s source 
documentation along with any  actions taken. If all required inform ation on the form is not 
available at the time of the initial report, follow -up information will be completed in the EDC 
system.
The Investigator is required to follow SAEs until resolution regardless of whether the 
subjects are still participating in the study . SAE resolution is defined as:
•Resolved with or without residual effects.
•A return to baseline for a pre -existing condition.
•Laboratory  values have returned to baseline or stabilized.

oftreatment with DX -2930, or medical conditions present prior to the start of treatment but 
increasing in severity  or relationship at the time of or following the start of treatment. The 
number and percentage of subjects with TEAEs will be display ed by [CONTACT_852758] (MedDRA®). 
Summaries in terms of severity  and relationship to DX -2930 will also be provided. SAEs will 
be summarized separately  in a similar fashion. Patient listings of AEs causing 
discontinuation of DX- 2930 treatment, AEs resulting in death, SAEs and AESI  will be 
produced.
AESI  will be anal yzed according to primary  System Organ Classes (SOCs) and Preferred 
Terms (PTs) determined by  [CONTACT_852741] (SMQs). 
Summary  tables with SOCs and PTs, from the SMQ searches, will be generated 
presenting the number and percentage of subjects by  [CONTACT_117795], severit y, seriousness, and 
relationship to study  medication.
Usage of concomitant medications (other than res cue medi cations) will be summarized 
descriptivel y.
Actual values and change from Day  [ADDRESS_1185759] withdrawals will be summarized.
Rollover Subjects: Adverse events that started during subject participation in DX -2930-[ADDRESS_1185760] participation in DX -2930-03 
DX-2930
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930- 04 Final: [ADDRESS_1185761] open -label dose in DX -2930- 04 and then subsequently  
started again in DX -2930-04 will be counted as a new AE in DX-2930-04.
The incidence of AEs in DX
-2930- 04 for subjects rolling over from each DX -2930-03 
treatment group (300 mg DX- 2930 every  2 weeks vs. 300 mg DX- 2930 every  4 weeks vs. 
150mg DX -2930 every  4 weeks vs placebo) as well as evaluation of overall AEs in the 
combined group of all rollover subjects will be assessed. Changes from baseline (last 
measurement prior to the first dose of DX- 2930 received, regardless of if it occurred in 
DX-2930- 03 or DX -
2930-04
) to the DX-2930- 04 time points for phy sical examination 
results, vital sign parameters, and clinical laboratory  parameters will be summarized by  
[CONTACT_304727]-2930- 03 treatment group and for the combined group of all rollover subjects. 
Non-rollover Subjects: Adverse events will be captured from the time of informed consent 
through the final study  visit.  Adverse event tabular summaries will be based on all 
treatment -emergent AEs.
9.9 Analysis of Quality  of Life A ssessments
Quality  of life data will be obtained using the EQ5D, SF -36, and Angioedema Quality  of Life 
Questionnaire (AE -QoL) at pre -dose on Day s 0, 98 ±3, and 182 ±3. An additional assessment 
will be conducted on Day  238 ±3 for subjects who complete the Follow- up Period.   Full 
details of the planned analy ses using these quality  of life assessments will be included in the 
SAP.

Subjects
The proposed pi[INVESTIGATOR_306339]  (DX -2930- 03) is entitled “HEL P StudyTM: A Multicenter, 
Randomized, Double -Blind, Placebo -Controlled Efficacy  and Sa fety Study  to Evaluate 
DX-[ADDRESS_1185786] Acute Attacks of Hereditary  Angioedema 
(HAE).” This study  will be a multi -center, double- blind, randomized, placebo -controlled 
parallel -arm study evaluating the efficacy  of DX -2930 in prevent ing acute angioedema 
attacks in patients with Type I or T ype II HAE. The double -blind study  is planned to be 
followed b y the study described in the present protocol, an open -label extension (OL E) study
(DX-2930- 04).
The primary  objective of study  DX-2930-
03 is to evaluate the efficacy  of DX -2930 in 
preventing HAE attacks. The secondary  objective is to evaluate the safet y of repeated SC 
administrations of DX- 2930. The tertiary  objectives are to evaluate the pharmacody namic 
effects of chronicall y administered DX-2930; to assess the immunogenicity  of chronically  
administered DX -2930; to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of chronically  administered 
DX-2930; and to evaluate the effect of DX -[ADDRESS_1185787] 
4 weeks. HAE subjects will then be randomized 2:1 to receive repeated subcutaneous (SC) 
administrations of DX- 2930 or placebo in a double -
blind fashion.  Subjects who are 
randomized to DX-2930 will be assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of three dose regimens: 
300mg every  [ADDRESS_1185788] do se on Day  0 through Day  182
Subjects may  consent to rollover into the OLE study  (present protocol DX -2930- 04) upon 
completion of their participation in the double -blind treatment period.
The primary  endpoint will be to compare the mean rate of investigator- confirmed HAE 
attacks observed in each DX-2930 treatment arm to that in the placebo arm during the 
efficacy  assessment period (Day  14 through Day  182).

Dose Rationale for Double -Blind, Pi[INVESTIGATOR_852686]-2930-03
The dose rationale is based on the pharmacod ynamic bioactivity, PK, safety, and efficacy of 
DX-2930 from the Phase 1 clinical studies and nonclinical studies. Together, th ese attributes 
provide the rationale for the selected doses and regimens to achieve drug levels likely  to 
prevent a majority  of HAE attacks. Based on these considerations, 300 mg every  2 weeks, 
300mg every  4 weeks, and 150 mg every  4 weeks were identified as the dosing regimens for 
evaluation,
The 3 proposed dose -regimen combinations provide a 6 -fold range of steady -state trough 
concentrations and leverage both the biomarker and efficacy  data generated in study

Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930 -04 27 June 2016 
Study Design:  
DX-2930-[ADDRESS_1185803] (IMP), DX-2930, in preventing acute angioedema 
attacks in patients with Type I and Type II HAE. There are two types of subjects who will be enrolled into this study: 
•Subjects who rollover fr om the DX -2930-03 study
•Subjects who are non- rollover (i.e.,  were not participants in DX -2930-03)
Rollover Subjects  
Rollover subjects are subjects who complete the double-blind treatment period at Day [ADDRESS_1185804]  DX-2930- 04 visit for rollover subjects (Day 0) will occur 
on the same day as the DX -2930-03 Day 182 study visit. Rollover subjects will complete all 
DX-2930- 03 final study assessments (Day 182) at which time they will be discharged from that 
study. No assessments conducted between the DX-2930-[ADDRESS_1185805] DX-2930- 04 visit (Day  0) will be duplicated. Results of the final DX -2930- [ADDRESS_1185806] 50 subjects (up to a maximum of 100) who were not participants in the DX-2930-[ADDRESS_1185807] wait until enrollment for the double- blind study has ended before they can screen for 
DX-2930-04. The Sponsor may ease this restriction based on the enrollment rate observed in DX-2930-03. Subjects who are still in the run-in period for DX-2930-03 when enrollment for 
that study closes, as well as subjects on prior LTP  who screen fail out of DX-2930-03 due to an 
inability to wash -out of th eir LTP, may screen for DX -2930-04 following discussion with the 
Sponsor medical monitor. 
Screening Period:  
There is no screening period for rollover subjects. 
Non-rollover subjects must provide informed consent and have screening assessments completed 
within [ADDRESS_1185808] open -label dose.  Screened non -rollover subjects  (adults and 
adolescents) who are on LTP with C1 -INH therapy for HAE can continue their current LTP until 
Page 4 of 151
DX-2930 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 5 
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930 -04 27 June 2016 
Day 8 (or Day 15) such that subjects will have received 2 (or 4) dose s of C1 -INH.  For subjects 
who are on attenuated androgens (e.g., danazol) or anti -fibrinolytics (e.g., tranexamic acid), a 
similar tapering schedule is recommended. However, the taper can be prolonged by [CONTACT_852765] , if medically indicated,  as long  as androgen or anti-fibrinolytic therapy is stopped within [ADDRESS_1185809] dose of DX -2930.   
Treatment Period:  
Rollover Subjects 
Following informed consent and pre- dose assessments, rollover subjects will receive a single 
open- label dose of 300 mg DX-2930 administered subcutaneously (SC) on Day 0.  Subjects will 
not receive any additional DX- [ADDRESS_1185810] be 
conducted at the investigative site: pregnancy testing, clinical laboratory testing, physical examination, 12-Lead ECG, QoL, PK, PD and anti-drug antibody sample collection. All other 
scheduled s tudy visits may be conducted via site check -in calls to collect information on adverse 
events, concomitant therapy, and HAE attack data.  See Study Activities Schedule  for which 
visits must be conducted at the study site. 
Once a rollover subject reports their first HAE attack they will present to the investigative site 
for their second open-label dose of DX-[ADDRESS_1185811] and site schedules allow.  If the second dose is to be administered within the accepted ±4 day window around a scheduled study visit, this treatment visit will represent that scheduled visit. If that scheduled visit has 
already occurred , the day of the visit will be considered an acceptable, extra study visit (i.e., an 
unscheduled visit).  Similarly, if the  second dose is admini stered outside of the accepted ±4 day 
window around a scheduled visit, the day of the visit will be considered an acceptable extra unscheduled study visit, (i.e., this visit will not replace any scheduled visit).  
Regardless of the study 
day, at the visit  in which the second open- label dose of DX -[ADDRESS_1185812]’s first HAE attack occurs, there will be a minimum of [ADDRESS_1185813]’s second dose, but will not exceed 26 doses. The Day 
Page 5 of 151
DX-2930 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 6 
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -[ADDRESS_1185814] dose adm inistered at the Day 350 study visit. 
All Subjects: 
All doses (with the exception of the second dose for rollover subjects) require  a minimum of 10 
days and maximum of 18 days between administrations, and should fall within the accepted ±[ADDRESS_1185815]’s medical history and per locally approved product information.  Administration of DX -[ADDRESS_1185816] receives treatment for a breakthrough angioedema attack  on the day of a scheduled dose of study drug (if self -administering) or scheduled study 
visit. 
Self-Administration  
All subjects (adolescent or adult) who are considered suitable candidates (i.e., those with a 
physical and mental capability of learning and willing to be trained) may be allowed to self -
administer treatment .  Subjects must complete appropriate training by [CONTACT_852766]. 
Subjects are allowed to initiate self -administration after receiving the first 2 doses of DX -2930 at 
the study site. Once initiated, subjects may self -administer subsequent doses of DX -2930 at the 
investigational site (when visits are scheduled study site visits) or the subject’s home or other agreed upon location (when the study permits off- site dosing). See Schedule of Activities for 
details. Adolescent subjects self-administering  investigational product will be supervised by a 
parent/legal guardian/caregiver. Alternatively, a parent/legal guardian/caregiver, after completing appropriate training , will be allowed to administer DX-[ADDRESS_1185817] been appropriately documented.  Throughout the study, study site personnel will document information in source documents (ie, 
the subject’s medical record ) and eCRF regarding the subject’s experience with self-
administration  and SC administration of DX -2930. 
 Follow- up Period  
After completion of the 350 day  treatment period, all subjects will undergo safety evaluations 
 
Page 6 of 151
DX-2930 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 7 
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -[ADDRESS_1185818] not yet completed the treatment period, and any subsequent subjects, to receive a different open -label 
DX-2930 dose and/or frequency. 
In addition, based on the results of the DX -2930-03 study, the Sponsor may switch to a different 
dose and/or frequency.  
Study Population:  
The study is expected to enroll subjects from the DX-2930-[ADDRESS_1185819] 50 (up to 
a maximum of 100) additional subjects who were not enrolled in DX-2930-03. The total enrollment is expected to be at least  [ADDRESS_1185820] 15 subjects who are 12 to 17 years of age, 
inclusive of the estimated 10 subjects 12 to 17 years old who roll over from the DX-2930-03 
study. 
Criteria for Inclusion:  
Subjects must meet the following criteria to be enrolled in this study:  
1. Male and female HAE subjects who are 12 years of age or older at the time of screening.  
2. Documented diagnosis of HAE (Type I or II)  based on all of the following: 
• Documented clinical history consistent with HAE (subcutaneous or mucosal, 
nonpruritic swelling epi[INVESTIGATOR_84143]). 
• Diagnostic testing results obtained during screening (or a prior DX -2930 study) that 
confirm HAE Type I or II: C1 inhibitor (C1 -INH) func tional level < 40% of the 
normal level. Subjects with functional C1- INH level 40 -50% of the normal level may 
be enrolled if they also have a C4 level below the normal range.  Subjects may be retested if results are incongruent with clinical history or beli eved by [CONTACT_941] i nvestigator 
to be confounded by [CONTACT_852767].  
• At least one of the following: Age at reported onset of first angioedema symptoms ≤ [ADDRESS_1185821] adhere to contraception requirements for the duration of the study as follows: 
• Females of childbearing potential must agree to be abstinent or it is recommended to use 
highly effective forms of contraception from screening through 30  days after the final 
 
Page 7 of 151
DX-2930 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 8 
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930 -04  27 June 2016 
 
 
study visit. This includes stable doses (for 3 months  prior to study screening ) of 
combined estrogen and proges tin-containing  hormonal contraception associated with 
inhibition of ovulation (oral, injectable or implantable), progestin -only hormonal 
contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation, intra -uterine device (IUD, all types) 
or intrauterine hormone releasing systems (IUS). Notes: 1) A female whose male partner has had a vasectomy must agree to use one additional form of medically acceptable contraception. 2) Use of a male condom with or without spermicide or cervical cap, diaphragm or sponge with spermicide or a combination (double barrier methods) are  not 
considered highly effective. 
• Females of non-childbearing potential, defined as surgically sterile (status post 
hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral tubal ligation) or post-menopausal for 
at least 12 months do not require contraception during the study. 
• Males, including males who are surgically sterile (post vasectomy), with female partners 
of childbearing potential must agree to be abstinent or else use a medically acceptable 
form of contraception from the screening period through 60 days after the final study 
visit.  
Criteria for Exclusion:   
Subjects who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from the study: 
1. Discontinued from DX-2930-03 after enrollment for any reason. 
2. If rolling over from DX-2930-03, presence of important safety concerns that would preclude 
participation in this study.  
3. Concomitant diagnosis of another form of chronic, recurrent angioedema such as acquired 
angioedema (AAE), HAE with normal C1-INH (also known as HAE Type III), idiopathic 
angioedema, or recurrent angioedema associated with urticaria.  
4. Dosing with an investigational drug (not including DX-2930 or other HAE therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] ) or 
exposure to an investigational device within 4 weeks prior to screening.  
5. Exposure to angioten sin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors within 4 weeks prior to study 
screening  or any newly initiated or dose modification of estrogen -containing medications 
with systemic absorption (such as oral contraceptives or hormonal  replacement therapy) 3 
months prior to the screening visit. 
6.  Unwilling to discontinue use of long-term prophylactic therapy for HAE (C1- INH, 
attenuated androgens, or anti- fibrinolytics) within [ADDRESS_1185822] abnormali ties: alanine aminotransferase (ALT) > 3x 
upper limit of normal, or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) > 3x upper limit of normal, or 
total bilirubin > 2x upper limit of normal (unless the bilirubin elevation is a result of 
Gilbert’s Syndrome).  
8. Pregnancy or breastfeeding. 
9. Subject has any condition that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_94367], may 
compromise their safety or compliance, preclude successful conduct of the study, or interfere with interpretation of the results (e.g., history of substance a buse or dependence, a significant 
pre-existing illness or other major comorbidity that the investigator considers may confound 
the interpretation of study results).

DX-2930 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 9 
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -[ADDRESS_1185823]; Dose; and Mode of Administration:  
DX-2930 is a sterile, preservative- free so lution for injection, pH 6.0. The active ingredient, 
DX-2930, is formulated using the following compendial components:  30 mM sodium phosphate dibasic dihydrate, 19.6 mM citric acid, 50 mM histidine, 90 mM sodium chloride, 0.01% Polysorbate 80. Each open-label vial contains a nominal concentration of [ADDRESS_1185824] will receive a total of 2 mL ( 2 vials) , which will 
be administered in a single 2 mL SC injection. The injection will be given in the upper arm, thigh or abdomen. 
Self-Administration  Option: Investigational product can  be self -administered  without supervision 
(parental  supervision required  for adolescent  subject)  after subjects receive  appropriate training  
by [CONTACT_852768]. Subjects are allowed to 
initiate self -administration  after receiving the first 2 doses of DX -2930 at the study site and may 
continue to self -administer all subsequent doses (see Study Activities Schedule) . 
Duration of Treatment:  
All subjects will receive open -label DX -[ADDRESS_1185825] dose administered on Day 0 and the final dose administered at the 
Day 350 study visit. 
There will be a ±[ADDRESS_1185826] from 
the investigational site . 
Duration of Study for Individual Subjects:  
Following informed consent, subjects will either rollover from DX-2930-03 or undergo screening assessments (non -rollover subjects). Screening assessments for non-rollover subjects 
must occur within [ADDRESS_1185827] open-label dose. Eligible subje cts will be enrolled 
and undergo a 350 day treatment period. At the conclusion of the 350 day treatment period, 
subjects will be followed for an additional 8 weeks.  
Prohibited Concomitant Treatments:  
Use of the following treatments will not be permitted during the study:  
• Long-term prophylaxis for HAE (e.g., use of C1- INH for LTP, attenuated androgens, or anti-
fibrinolytics) once LTP is discontinued ( within [ADDRESS_1185828] dose of DX-
2930).  
• Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. 
• Initiat ing or changing the dose of estrogen -containing medications with systemic absorption 
 
Page 9 of 151
DX-2930 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 10 
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930 -04  27 June 2016 
 
 
(such as oral contraceptives or hormonal replacement therapy)  3 months prior to study 
screening . 
• Use of androgens (e.g., stanozolol, danazol, oxandrolone, methyltestosterone, and 
testosterone ) for non-HAE related medical conditions or for HAE after discontinuation  
during the first three weeks . 
• Any other investigational drug or device.  
The use of short- term prophylactic treatment for HAE will be permitted if medically  indicated.  
Short- term (pre-procedure) prophylaxis is defined as use of C1 -INH to avoid angioedema 
complications from medically indicated procedures.  
Management of Acute Attacks:  
Acute HAE attacks during the study are to be managed in accord with the i nvestigator’s usual 
care of their patients, including use of acute attack therapi[INVESTIGATOR_852687]. Use of C1- INH will be permitted as an acute attack therapy but not as a 
long-term prophylactic therapy. Administration  of DX-[ADDRESS_1185829] has symptoms of 
an HAE attack th e day of DX -2930 administration and/or receives treatment for an HAE attack.   
The administration of DX-2930 can also be re- scheduled as long as the minimum and maximum 
timeframe between doses are met based on patient preference or physician discretion.  
Safety Assessments:  
Safety assessments will include the following:  
• Adverse events (AEs), including serious adverse events (SAEs) and adverse events of special interest (AESI). SAEs and AESI will be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours of becoming 
aware of the event.  
• Vital signs, including sitting or supi[INVESTIGATOR_9204] (BP), heart rate (HR), body 
temperature, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] (RR)  
• Physical examination 
• Clinical laboratory testing (hematology, serum chemistry, coagulation and urinalysis) 
• 12-Lead electrocardiogram (ECG)  
Adverse events of special interest (AESI) will be captured  and monitored during this study. 
Hypersensitivity reactions and events of disordered coagulation will be considered AESI.  
Pharmacokinetic (PK) Assessments:  
Blood samples will be collected for the measurement of plasma DX -2930 concentrations. 
Pharmacodyn amic (PD) Assessments:  
Blood samples will be collected to evaluate the pharmacodynamic effects of DX -2930 through 
biomarker assays.  
Immunogenicity Assessments:  
Blood samples will be collected to assay for the presence of anti -drug antibodies, including 
evaluation of neutralizing antibodies (if any confirmed positive anti-drug antibodies are 
detected).

DX-2930 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 11 
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930 -04  27 June 2016 
 
 
C1-INH, C1q and C4 Assessments:  
Samples for C1-INH, C4, and C1q assays will be obtained at screening for eligibility assessment, 
unless already collected as part of protocol DX-2930-02 or DX-2930-03.  
Quality of Life Assessments:  
Quality of life (QoL) assessments will be conducted using the Angioedema Quality of Life Questionnaire (AE-QoL), EuroQoL 5-Dimensional 5- Level Measure (EQ-5D-5L), Work 
Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire: General Health (WPAI- GH), Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_70505] (HADS), and 12 Item Short Form Survey (SF-12). 
DX-[ADDRESS_1185830]’s experience with self-administration and S C injection will be 
completed by [CONTACT_852769] -2930. 
 
In addition, assessment survey  of subject experience with SC and self -administration injections 
of DX -[ADDRESS_1185831] approximately every 6 months . 
Collection of HAE Attack Data:  
The collection, reporting and assessment of attacks in this study will be done in accordance with the HAE Attack Assessment and Reporting Procedures (HAARP).  Study s ite personnel will be 
trained on HAARP prior to screening and enrolling subjects at their site. 
Study site personnel will train subjects and caregivers on identifying symptoms of an attack, the 
requirements for reporting attacks and the information they will be expected to provide.  The patient (and caregiver) will confirm their understanding of what is required of them for reporting attacks to the site.  
At screening, HAE attack history will be collected for non-rollover subjects. Information collecte d will include any prior history of laryngeal attacks, attack frequency, average severity, 
predominant attack location(s), triggers, average duration, acute attack therapy use and history of LTP (including duration of LTP, medication(s) and dose used for LTP, and frequency of attacks while receiving LTP).  If available, information will also be collected on HAE diagnosis (year of confirmation, how many years after onset of symptoms was diagnosis confirmed, or if subject was misdiagnosed).  
During the study, subjects (or caregivers) will be instructed to notify and report details to the study site within [ADDRESS_1185832] in tracking any HAE attacks experienced , but its use is 
not mandatory.  
Subjects (or caregivers) will be asked to provide the following information when reporting an 
attack:  
• Date and time symptoms of an attack were first experienced . 
 
Page 11 of 151
DX-2930 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 12 
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930 -04  27 June 2016 
 
 
• Description of sympto ms experienced, including location(s) . 
• Impact on activity (work, school, social interactions) and whether any assistance or 
medical intervention was required, including hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], additional laboratory tests or emergency department visits. 
• Any medic ations used to treat the attack (both prescription and over the counter). 
• If the attack resolved, date and time the subject was no longer experiencing symptoms. 
Study s ite personnel will review the information provided and solicit additional information as  
necessary to document the attack, as described in HAARP.  
Study site personnel will contact [CONTACT_852770] [ADDRESS_1185833] -reported and i nvestigator/ physician designee -confirmed HAE attacks will 
be recorded in the eCRF.  
Emergency department visits for HAE attacks and HAE attacks resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_852688]. 
To be confirmed as an attack, the event must have symptoms or signs consistent with an attack in 
at least one of the following locations:  
• Peripheral angioedema: cutaneous swelling involving an extremity, the face, neck, torso, 
and/or geni tourinary region. 
• Abdominal angioedema: abdominal pain, with or without abdominal distention, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. 
• Laryngeal angioedema: stridor, dyspnea, difficulty speaking, difficulty swallowing, throat 
 
Page 12 of 151
DX-2930 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 13 
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930 -04  27 June 2016 
 
 
tightening, or swelling of the tongue, p alate, uvula, or larynx . 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_852689], the investigator or physician designee may still clinically determine that the event did not represent an attack if there are features that strongly refute such a diagnosis. For example, the reported event is accompanied by [CONTACT_784432] (e.g., urticaria), the reported event persists well beyond the typi[INVESTIGATOR_852665], or there is a likely alternate etiology for the event (e.g., the subje ct’s abdominal symptoms are attributable to a viral gastroenteritis outbreak in the 
household).  
To be counted as a unique attack distinct from the previous attack, the new symptoms must occur 
at least 24 hours after resolution of the prior attack’s symptoms.  
Interim Analyses and Data Monitoring  
A formal interim analysis will be conducted  at least [ADDRESS_1185834] completed 12 months of 
consecutive exposure to DX -2930 across the combined DX -2930- 03 and DX -2930-04 studies, 
and only after database lock of the DX-2930-03 study.  Subsequent interim analyses may be 
conducted to support administrative decisions and/or regulatory reporting as required.   
 An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) has been established to provide ongoing, independent review and assessment of the safety data for the DX-2930-03 study. While 
an independent DSMB is not currently planned for this study, summary safety data from DX-
2930-04 may be reviewed by [CONTACT_852771]-2930-03 study as part of the 
collection of safety information available on DX-2930.  
Individual Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1869]:  
Dosing for any individual subject will be discontinued if the subject experiences a DX-2930- related SAE (or a DX -2930- related, clinically significant non -serious AE) that, in the 
assessment of the investigator, warrants discontinuation from further dosing for that subject’s 
well-being. The i nvestigator has the ability to contact [CONTACT_852772]. Subjects will continue t o be followed through the completion of all scheduled non-
dosing visits, unless they request to be discontinued from the study.  
Criteria for Evaluation: 
Safety Measures:  
• AEs including SAEs and AESI 
• Clinical Laboratory testing (hematology, clinical chemistry, coagulation and urinalysis) 
• Vitals signs including blood pressure, heart rate, oral body temperature and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] 
• Physical Examination  
• 12-lead ECG  
Efficacy Endpoints: 
• Time to first HAE attack for rollover subjects (based upon time from f irst open label study 
dose until first HAE attack)  
• Number of investigator confirmed HAE attacks during the treatment period

• Number of investigator confirmed HAE attacks requiring acute treatment during the 
treatment period  
• Number of moderate or severe HAE  attacks during the treatment period 
• Number of high-morbidity HAE attacks during the treatment period ; a high -morbidity HAE 
attack is defined as any attack that has at least one of the following characteristics: severe, results in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (except h ospi[INVESTIGATOR_28061] < 24 hours), 
hemodynamically significant (systolic blood pressure < 90, requires IV hydration, or associated with syncope or near -syncope) or laryngeal. 
 
Additional Measures:  
• Anti-drug antibody development 
• Pharmacokinetics (P K)  
• Pharmacodynamic (PD) effects 
• Quality of Life Assessments  
• DX-2930 Injection Report  
• DX-2930 Self -administration and Subcutaneous Injection Survey  
Analysis Populations:  
• The Safety Population will include all subjects who received any study drug after entering 
the DX-2930-04 study (i.e., any exposure to open- label DX -2930).    
 
• The Rollover Safety Population is the subset of subjects who participated in the DX-2930-03 
study and received any study drug after entering the DX-2930-04 study (i.e., any exposure to 
open- label DX -2930).  
 
• The Non-rollover Safety Population is the subset of subjects who entered the DX-2930-04 study directly and received any study drug after entering the DX -2930-04 study (i.e., any 
exposure to open -label DX -2930).    
Sample Size Determination:  
No formal sample size calculation was performed.  The sample size is not based on any statistical considerations.  This study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of open -label 
treatment with DX -2930 in subjects who participated in DX-2930-03 and individuals who were 
not otherwise able to participate in DX -2930-03. 
Statistical Methodology: 
Time to the first investigator-confirmed HAE a ttack  will be analyzed using the Rollover Safety 
Population. 
 
Time to the first investigator- confirmed HAE attack (days) will be calculated from the date and 
time of the first open -label dose of DX -[ADDRESS_1185835] investigator -confirmed  HAE attack will

Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -[ADDRESS_1185836] investigator-confirmed HAE attack, inc luding but not limited to: baseline attack rate prior to entering DX -2930-03, the 
treatment group in DX-2930-03, the time since the last dose given in DX-2930-03, the time since the last HAE attack, and the rate of attacks during DX-2930-03. Results of this exploratory analysis will be summarized.   
 
Number of Investigator-confirmed HAE Attacks 
 The number of investigator-confirmed HAE attacks during the treatment period (Day 0 through Day 350) expressed as a monthly HAE attack rate, will be analyzed using each analysis 
population.  The monthly rate of investigator -confirmed HAE attacks during the treatment period will be 
calculated for each subject as the number of investigator -confirmed HAE attacks occurring 
during the treatment period divided by [CONTACT_852773] [ADDRESS_1185837].  Similar summary tables will be presented for the following efficacy endpoints for each analysis 
population: 
• Number of investigator- confirmed HAE attacks requiring acute treatment during the 
treatment period.  
• Number of moderate or severe investigator -confirmed HAE attacks during the treatment 
period. 
• Number of high-morbidity investigator- confirmed HAE attacks during the treatment period; 
a high-morbidity HAE attack is defined as any attack that has at least one of the following characteristics: severe, results in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (except hospi[INVESTIGATOR_28061] < 24 hours), hemodynamically significant (systolic blood pressure < 90, requires IV hydration, or 
associated with syncope or near -syncope) or laryngeal.

Safety Analysis: 
Adverse Events 
 Treatment -emergent AEs are defined as AEs with onset at the time of or following the first 
exposure to open- label DX -2930 in this study, or medical conditions present prior to the start of 
treatment but increasing in severity or relationship at the time of or following the start of 
treatment.  
 
The analyses described in this section will be ba sed on treatment- emergent AEs; plainly referred 
to as AEs in this section for brevity.    Related AEs are AEs classified as related to study drug by [CONTACT_093].  Severe AEs are AEs classified as severe (grade 3) or life threatening (grade 4) by [CONTACT_093]. 
 The number and percentage of subjects with any AE, any related AE, any SAE, any related SAE, any severe AE , and any related severe AE as well as the total number of events for each category 
will be summarized.  The number of deaths due to an AE, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_852690].   The number and percentage of subjects with an AE, as well as the total number of AEs, will be summarized by [CONTACT_2946], and PT. This tabulation will be repeated for rel ated AEs, SAEs, related 
SAEs, severe AEs, and related severe AEs.  
 Adverse events of special interest (AESI) for this study are hypersensitivity reactions and disordered coagulation (hypercoagulability events and bleeding events).  Standardized MedDRA Queries (SMQ) for each AESI will be performed using the study data. 
The number and percentage 
of subjects with an AESI, as well as the total number of AESIs, will be summarized by [CONTACT_3592]. 
Separate summary tables will be created for each AESI and for those events with the SMQs classified as related, serious, related serious, severe, and related severe.  A listing detailing the PT within the SMQ will be provided.  
Laboratory Test Results, Vital Signs, and Electrocardiography Results  
 Baseline is defined as th e last non-missing value prior to the first exposure to DX-2930. For 
rollover subjects previously exposed to DX-2930, baseline is the last non-missing value prior to first exposure to study drug in the DX-2930-[ADDRESS_1185838] results will be classified according to the reference ranges and clinical significance as determined by [CONTACT_093]. Vital sign values will be classified according to clinical significance as determined by [CONTACT_093]. The number of subjects with a non -
missing result, and the number and percentage of subjects within each category will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_15449].

NOTE:  Shaded columns represent scheduled in-site visits for all subjects. Non-shaded columns indicate potential subject -elected off -site activity and/or self -administration dosing.  
NOTE :  “( )”s indicate activities that may occur as applicable (ie, activities for rollover subjects)  
1. Screening visit is for non-rollover subjects only.  Screening visit can occur up to [ADDRESS_1185839] receives their second open label dose.  
3. Visit 28 is a site check -in call for all rollover and non-rollover subjects.  
4. Subjects who terminate from the study early will undergo (if possible) all of the assessments and procedures at Visit 29, their final study visit  
5. Rollover subjects must sign informed consent for DX -2930-04 after Day 168 of study DX-2930-03 and no later than the final DX-2930-03 Day 182 treatment period study 
 visit.  
6. For rollover subjects Day 182 of the DX-2930-03 study is also Day 0 of the DX-2930-04 study and informed consent may be completed on this visit, if not already provided.  
7. Screened non-rollover subjects (adults and adolescents) who are on LTP with C1- INH therapy for HAE can continue their current LTP until Day 8 (or Day 15) such that 
 subjects will have received 2 (or 4) doses of C1-INH.  For subjects who are on attenuated androgens (e.g., danazol) or anti -fibrinolytics (e.g., tranexamic acid), a similar 
 tapering schedule is recommended. However, the taper can be prolonged by [CONTACT_852775] -fibrinolytic therapy is stopped within [ADDRESS_1185840] and second open-label doses is required. If the second dose is to be administered within the accepted ±4 day window around a 
 scheduled study visit, this treatment visit will represent that scheduled visit unless that  scheduled visit has already occurred. If that scheduled visit has already occurred, or if 
 the second dose is to be administered outside of the accepted ± [ADDRESS_1185841] any scheduled visit and will thus  represent an 
 acceptable, extra study visit (i.e., an unscheduled visit). Regardless, at the visit in which the second open-label dose of DX -[ADDRESS_1185842] will undergo pre -
 dose assessments for vital signs, physical examination (performed in accordance with standards at the site), clinical laboratory testing, PK, PD, and anti -drug antibody. Vital 
 signs will be obtained at [ADDRESS_1185843] -dosing. As with all study visits, informa tion will be collected on adverse events, concomitant therapy, and HAE attack data.  
10. All subjects (adolescent or adult) who are considered suitable candidates (i.e., those with a physical and mental capability of learning and willing to be trained) may be 
 allowed to self -administer DX -2930 after completing appropriate training by [CONTACT_852776]. Subjects are a llowed to initiate

Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -[ADDRESS_1185844] to self -administer subsequent doses of DX -2930 at the investigational site 
 (during scheduled study site visits; shaded columns).  
11. Subjects may self -administer DX -2930 at home or other agreed upon location (during optional off-site self -administration visits; non -shaded columns). Site personnel will call 
 subjects after the planned self-administration to ensure the administration occurred, to collect AEs, concomitant medications, and to ensure all attacks have  been appropriately 
 documented. 
12. Samples for C1- INH, C4, and C1q assays will be obtained at screening for eligibility assessment unless already collected as part of protocol DX-2930-[ADDRESS_1185845] dose.  Tests 
 performed at screening and on indicated visits can be serum or urine -based.  
14. There is a recommended ± [ADDRESS_1185846] from the investigative site at optional off-site visits (indicated non-shaded columns). Height and weight will be 
 collected at the Screening visit only.  
15. Physical examinations will be conducted for all rollover and non- rollover subjects according to the study activities schedule and in accordance with standards at the site.  In 
 addition to the physical examinations specified in the study activities schedule, an additional physical examination (performed in accordance with standards at the  site) will be 
 conducted for rollover subjects prior to dosing on the day of their second open- label dose, at whatever study visit  that occurs.  
16. Clinical laboratory testing will include Hematology, Coagulation, Serum Chemistry, and Urinalysis (urinalysis does not need to be done as part of the clinical laboratory 
 testing at Visits 14, 17, 20, and 23). Clinical laboratory testing will  be conducted for all rollover and non-rollover subjects according to the study activities schedule.  In 
 addition to the testing specified in the study activities schedule, additional testing will be conducted for rollover subjects prior to dosing on the day of their second open-label 
 dose, at whatever study visit that occurs.  
17. Historical HAE attack information will be collected at screening. During the study, subjects (or caregivers) are instructed t o report details of the attack to the study site within 
 [ADDRESS_1185847]’s injection reports of their experience with DX -[ADDRESS_1185848]’s injection surveys of their experience with DX -2930 self-administration and subcutaneous injection for indicated visits.  
21. PK, PD and Anti -drug Antibody PD samples will be drawn for all rollover and non -rollover subjects according to the study activities schedule.  In addition to the samples 
 specified in the study activities schedule, an additional PK, PD and Anti -drug Antibody sample will be drawn for rollover subjects prior to dosing on the day of their second

1. INTRODUCTION  
1.1 DX-2930 
DX-2930 is a fully human IgG1 recombinant monoclonal antibody that binds specifically to 
active plasma kallikrein. DX -2930 is being developed for prophylactic treatment of angioedema 
attacks in patients with hereditary angioedema (HAE), a serious and life- threatening disease.  
1.2 Hereditary Angioedema  
HAE is a long -term, debilitating, and life -threatening disease caused by [CONTACT_439081] 
C1-inhibitor (C1-INH) gene, resulting in deficiency or dysfunction of C1- INH protein. HAE 
manifests clinically as unpredict able, intermittent attacks of subcutaneous or submucosal edema 
of the face, larynx, gastrointestinal tract, limbs and/or genitalia ( Zuraw, 2008). Swelling may last 
up to five or more days; most patients suffer multiple attacks per year. HAE is an orphan disorder. The exact prevalence of HAE is unknown, but current estimates range from [ADDRESS_1185864] estimate (By[CONTACT_281998], 2009; Goring et al., 1998; Lei et al., 2011; Nordenfelt et al., 2014; 
[COMPANY_002] et al., 2005).  
Swelling in the larynx can obstruct the airways and cause death from asphyxiation ( Bork et al., 
2012; Bork et al., 2000 ). Approximately 50% of all HAE patients will experience a laryngeal 
attack in their lifetime, and there is no way to predict which patients are at risk of a laryngeal 
attack (Bork et al., 2003 ; Bork et al., 2006).  
Abdominal attacks are often associated with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea  and severe pain; 
intestinal symptoms resembling abdominal emergencies may lead to unnecessary surgery (Zuraw, 2008).  
Approximately 85% of patients have Type I HAE, characterized by [CONTACT_852777] C1- INH protein, while the remaining approximately 15% of patients have 
Type II HAE and produce normal or elevated levels of a functionally impaired C1- INH (Zuraw, 
2008). In patients with Types I and II HAE, uncontrolled plasma kallikrein generation results in excess bradykinin release from high -molecular weight kininogen (HMWK) and vascular leak 
mediated by [CONTACT_852778] B2 receptor (B2- R) on the surface of endothelial cells 
(Zuraw, 2008). Clinical suspi[INVESTIGATOR_852695] I and II HAE can be confirmed by [CONTACT_852779]. In addition to abnormali ties in C1 -INH level and function, plasma C4 levels are often  
reduced in blood from most patients. 
1.3 Therapeutic Rationale for DX -2930 
Plasma kallikrein plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of HAE attacks (Davis, 2006; Kaplan 
and Joseph, 2010). In normal physiology, C1- INH regulates the activity of plasma kallikrein  as 
well as a variety of other proteases, such as C1r, C1s, factor XIa, and factor XIIa. Plasma 
kallikrein regulates the release of bradykinin from HMWK. Due to a deficiency of C1- INH in 
HAE, uncontrolled plasma kallikrein activity occurs and leads to the excessive generation of 
bradykinin. Bradykinin is a vasodilator which is thought to be responsible for the characteristic HAE symptoms of localized swelling, inflammation, and pain ( Craig et al., 2012; Zuraw et al., 
 
Page 34 of 151
DX-2930 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 35 
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930 -04  27 June 2016 
 
2013). Intervening at the level of bradykinin production with a plasma kallikrein inhibitor 
therefore represents an attractive and rational therapeutic strategy for HAE. Indeed, the importance of plasma kallikrein as a drug target in HAE has been validated through the observed effectiveness of Kalbitor
® (ecallantide), a peptide that specifically targets plasma kallikrein, 
which was approved by [CONTACT_38785] A for the treatment of acute HAE attacks ( Kalbitor® Package 
Insert, 2015).  
DX-2930 is a highly potent and specific inhibitor of plasma kallikrein (K i = 125 pM). X-ray 
crystallography of DX-2930 combined with plasma kallikrein demonstrates DX-2930 binding to the active site of kallikrein (Kenniston et al., 2014). 
1.[ADDRESS_1185865] -in-human study with DX-2930 in healthy 
subjects did not identify any safety concerns. Single doses up to 3 mg/kg of DX-2930 were well-tolerated. There were no dose- limiting toxicities, serious adverse e vents, or any other safety 
concerns identified.  
Pharmacokinetic (PK) data from the Phase 1a (DX-2930-01) and Phase 1b (DX-2930-02) 
clinical stud ies in conjunction with data from the nonclinical toxicity studies support a wide 
safety margin. The mean C
max for human subjects treated at a dose of 300 mg on Days 1 and 15 
was approximately 27 µ g/ mL . As comparison, a mean C max of 744 µ g/ mL was observed 
following dosing of monkeys with 50 mg/kg DX-2930 subcutaneous (SC) weekly for 6 months  
resulting in a safety margin of approximately 28- fold. No toxicologically significant findings 
were observed in these treated animals or in any other nonclinical toxicity study to date for  
systemically administered DX -2930. 
Safety data is also available from the Phase 1b study (DX-2930- 02), a multiple -ascending dose 
study in HAE patients. In this study, two doses of DX-2930 up to 400 mg administered 14 days apart were well -tolerated. There were no dose-limiting toxicities, serious adverse events in any 
DX-2930 treated subjects, or any other safety concerns identified in this study of HAE patients. Pharmacokinetic data from the 1b study found that the drug exposure following two administrations of DX-2930 (up to a maximum of 400 mg) was substantially less than that 
attained and evaluated in the nonclinical toxicity studies.

Investigator’s Brochure.

1.6 DX-2930 Clinical Data 
The clinical development program to date for DX-2930 consists of 2 studies to evaluate the 
safety, tolerability, and PK of DX-2930, including one completed Phase 1a single-ascending

Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930 -04  27 June 2016 
 
dose study in healthy subjects and a Phase 1b multiple- ascending dose study in HAE patients. 
These studies are summarized in the following sections.  
1.6.1 Single -Ascending Dose Study in Healthy Subjects (DX -2930 -01) 
DX-2930-01 was a Phase 1a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in healthy 
subjects to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK following a single, SC dose of DX-2930. Participating subjects were randomized to receive placebo or active study drug within one of the following sequential, ascending dose cohorts: 0.1, 0.3, 1.0, or 3.0 mg/kg. For each dosing cohort, 6 subjects were randomized to receive active drug and 2 subjects to receive placebo.  
A total of 32 subjects enrolled in the study and were randomized. The treatment groups were well balanced for demographic characteristics. The actual dose of DX -2930 administered to 
subjects ranged from 6.2 mg (in the 0.1 mg/kg group) to 300 mg (in the 3.0 mg/kg group) across all cohorts.  
Based on the safety analysis, a single administration of DX-2930 was well tolerated up to doses 
of 3.0 mg/kg without evidence of dose-limiting toxicity. There were no deaths, SAEs, or subject discontinuations due to adverse events (AEs) during the study. Furthermore, there was no significant imbalance between placebo and DX-2930 for any particular treatment- emergent 
adverse event (TEAE). The most commonly reported TEAE was headache, which occurred at a rate of 25% for both DX-[ADDRESS_1185866] of DX-2930 in humans.  
For additional detail regarding the single dose, clinical study in healthy subjects, please refer to 
the DX-2930 Investigator’s Brochure. 
1.6.2 Multiple -Ascending Dose Study in HAE Patients (DX -2930-02) 
DX-2930-02 was a Phase 1b randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled , multiple ascending-
dose study in patients with HAE to evaluate safety, tolerability, and PK of SC DX-2930. 
Participating subjects were randomized 2:1 to receive either active study drug or placebo within 
one of the following sequential, ascending dose cohorts: 30, 100, 300, or 400 mg (nominal 6 subjects per cohort). Each subject received [ADDRESS_1185867] demographics were balanced in terms of age, race, ethnicity and BMI. There were slightly more females in the DX -2930 group than in the placebo group (66.7% versus 53.8%).

Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -[ADDRESS_1185868] (30 mg) with 
injection site pain lasting [ADDRESS_1185869] (400 mg) with worsening headache lasting 1 minute and night sweats. 
No safety signals were identified for vital signs, physical examinations, clinical laboratory tests, 
or electrocardiograms (ECG). Results suggested DX -[ADDRESS_1185870]-dose samples (3.3%), obtained from 2 out of 23 subjects (8.7%), were 
confirmed to be anti-drug antibody- positive.  No samples were positive for neutralizing activity.  
The pharmacokinetic analysis for all subjects in the 30, 100, 300 and 400 mg doses showed drug levels in HAE subjects were dose -dependent and exhibited a prolonged half- life of 
approximately 2 weeks, typi[INVESTIGATOR_12340] a human monoclonal antibody. C
max drug levels increased with 
increasing dose, as expected. These parameters were consistent with values obtained in healthy subjects in study DX-2930-01. 
A Western blot assay showed pre- dose baseline levels of mean 2 -chain HMWK in unactivated 
plasma collected from HAE patients was approximately 50%. A statistically significant reduction 
in 2-chain HMWK levels was observed on study days [ADDRESS_1185871] 2 attacks in the 3 months prior to study entry (0.15 attacks/week). Of those subjects treated with 300 or 400 mg DX-2930, 15 of 16 subjects met these criteria. Of the placebo treated subjects, 11 of 13 subjects met these criteria.  
The baseline HAE attack rates (attacks/week) were 0.39 attacks per week in the placebo group, 
0.33 attacks per week in the 300 mg group, 0.55 attacks per week in the 400 mg group and 0.49 
attacks per week in the 300 and 400 mg combined group. During the pre- specified, primary 
efficacy interval of 6 weeks (from days 8 to 50; corresponding to a period of notable drug exposure), the HAE attack rate, adjusted for baseline attack rate, was 0 in the 300  mg group and 
0.045 attacks per week in the 400 mg group, compared to 0.37 attacks per week in the placebo group. This resulted in a 100% reduction vs placebo for the 300 mg DX-2930 group ( P < 0.0001) 
and an 88% reduction vs placebo for 400 mg DX-2930 ( P = 0.005). During this primary efficacy 
interval, 100% of subjects in the 300 mg group ( P = 0.026) and 82% of subjects in the 400 mg 
group ( P = 0.03) were attack -free compared with 27% of su bjects in the placebo group. 
The data from this study demonstrated proof of concept of the ability of DX-2930 to prevent acute attacks of HAE. A statistically significant finding of HAE attack prevention by [CONTACT_304727]-2930 was observed. DX- 2930 was well tolerated in HAE subjects up to 400 mg. Drug exposure 
appeared to be dose -proportional and consistent with the results obtained in healthy subjects in

1.[ADDRESS_1185873] udy will be preceded by [CONTACT_852742] a pi[INVESTIGATOR_22735], multi-
center, double-blind, randomized, placebo- controlled parallel-arm study (DX-2930-03) 
evaluating the efficacy of DX-2930 in preventing acute angioedema attacks in patients with Type 
I or Type II HAE.  Further information on the DX-2930-03 study design can be found in Appendix 5. 
Subjects who complete the DX-2930-03 treatment period will be offered the option of rolling 
into the open-label extension study, DX-2930-04.  In addition, a limited  number of individuals 
with HAE Type I or Type II who were not enrolled in DX-2930-03 (up to 100) will be also 
enrolled.  The rationale for this open -label extension study is to evaluate the long -term safety of repeated 
subcutaneous treatment with DX -2930 and the long- term efficacy  of DX -2930 in preventing 
HAE attacks .  For subjec ts rolling over from DX-2930-03 who were randomized to one of the 
active study arms, the total duration of exposure across both studies will cover 18 months.  For 
rollover subjects randomized to placebo in DX-2930-03, and for non- rollover subjects, the total 
duration of exposure will cover 12 months.  Combined, the overall exposure between 
DX-2930-03 and DX-2930-04 will provide a sizable dataset to evaluate D X-2930 as a life-long, 
chronic treatment for preventing acute attacks of HAE.   
This study seeks to evaluate the outer bounds of DX-2930 dosing frequency (possibly beyond 
2 to 4 weeks) by [CONTACT_852780]  a rollover subject’ s first op en-label dose 
and t heir first reported HAE attack .  In addition, characteristics of all HAE attack s will be 
reported and compared to the subject’s historical baseline (for non- rollo ver subjects) or attack 
history based on attacks reported in the  DX-2930-03 study (for rollover subjects ). 
For non-rollover subjects, the study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of switching from a long-term prevention therapy (eg, C1 -INH, anti-fibrinolytics , androgens) to DX -[ADDRESS_1185874] health -related quality of life  (QoL), subject experience with self-
administration and ease of SC administration  with DX-2930.

DX-2930-03 Day 182 study visit. Rollover subjects will complete a ll DX -2930-03 final study 
assessments (Day 182) at which time they will be discharged from that study. No assessments 
conducted between the DX-2930-[ADDRESS_1185877] DX-2930-04 visit (Day 0) will be duplicated.  Results of the final DX -2930- [ADDRESS_1185878] 50 subjects (up to a maximum of 100) who were not participants in the DX -2930-[ADDRESS_1185879] wait until enrollment for the double- blind study has ended before they can screen for 
DX-2930-04. The Sponsor may ease this restriction based on the enrollment rate observed in DX-2930-03. Subjec ts who are still in the run-in period for DX-2930-03 when enrollment for 
that study closes, as well as subjects on prior LTP  who screen fail out of DX-2930-03 due to an  
inability to wash -out of their LTP , may screen for DX -2930-04 following discussion with the 
Sponsor medical monitor.

Screening Period:  
Rollover subjects 
There is no screening period for rollover subjects. 
 
Non-rollover subjects   
Non-rollover subjects  must provide informed consent and have screening assessments completed 
within [ADDRESS_1185880] open -label dose.  Screened non -rollover subjects  (adults and 
adolescents)  who are on LTP with C1 -INH therapy for HAE can continue their current LTP until 
Day 8 (or Day 15) such that subjects will have received 2 (or 4) doses of C1- INH.  For subjects 
who are on attenuated androgens (e.g., danazol) or anti- fibrinolytics (e.g., tranexamic acid) ; a 
similar ta pering schedule is recommended. However, the taper can be prolonged by [CONTACT_852781]-fibrinolytic therapy is stopped within  [ADDRESS_1185881] dose of DX -2930.   
 
Treatment Period:  
Rollover Subjects 
Following informed consent and pre- dose assessments, rollover subjects will receive a single 
open- label dose of  DX-2930 administered subcutaneously ( SC) on Day 0. Subjects will not 
receive any additional DX -[ADDRESS_1185882] be conducted at the investigative site: pregnancy testing, clinical laboratory testing, physical 
examination, 12- Lead ECG, QoL, PK, PD and anti-drug antibody sample collection.  All other 
scheduled study visits may be conducted via sit e check -in calls to collect information on adverse 
events, concomitant therapy, and HAE attack data.  See  Study Activities Schedule for which 
visits must be conducted at the study site . 
Once a rollover subject reports their first HAE attack they will present to the investigative site 
for their second open-label dose of DX-[ADDRESS_1185883] and site schedules allow.  If 
the second dose is to be admi nistered within the accepted ± 4 day window around a scheduled 
study visit, this treatment visit will represent that scheduled visit. If that scheduled visit has 
already occurred , the day of the visit will be considered an acceptable, extra study visit .   
In the event that the second dose is to be administered outside of the accepted ±4 day window 
around a scheduled visit, the day of the visit will be considered an acceptable extra study visit (i.e., this visit will not replace any scheduled visit).  
Regardless of the study day, at the visit in which the second open- label dose of DX-[ADDRESS_1185884] will undergo pre- dose assessments for vital signs, physical

Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -[ADDRESS_1185885] dose administered at the Day 350 study visit. 
All Subjects:  
For all subjects, subsequent doses after the second dose require a minimum of 10 days and 
maximum of 18  days between administrations, and should fall within the accepted ± 4 day 
window around study visits.  
After the second DX-2930 dose is given either within the study window (±4 days) or an 
acceptable extra study visit, the 3rd dose must be administered at the next pre- defined study visit 
according to the schedule of assessments.  
Regardless of when a subject’s first HAE attack occurs, there will be a minimum of [ADDRESS_1185886]’s second dose, but will not exceed [ADDRESS_1185887] visit at which a dose may be administered . 
Self-Administration  
All subjects (adolescent or adult) who are considered suitable candidates (i.e., those with a 
physical and mental capability of learning and willing to be trained) may be allowed to self -
administer treatment . Subjects must complete appropriate training by [CONTACT_852782]. Subjects are allowed to initiate self -administration after rece iving the first 2 doses of DX-2930 at 
the study site. Once initiated, subjects may self -administer subsequent doses of DX -2930 at the 
investigational site (when visits are scheduled study site visits) or the subject’s home or other 
agreed upon location ( when the study permits off-site dosing ). See Schedule of Activities for 
details. Adolescent subjects self -administering DX-2930 will be supervised by a parent/legal 
guardian/caregiver. Alternatively, a parent/legal guardian/caregiver, after completing appropriate training , will be allowed to administer the investigational product to  an adolescent without study  
site personnel  supervision. Site personnel will call subjects after the planned self -administration 
to ensure the administration occurred, to collect A Es, concomitant medications, and to ensure all 
attacks have been appropriately documented.

Follow- up Period  
After completion of the 350 day tre atment peri od, all subjects will undergo safety evaluations 
during an 8-week follow-up period.  Figure 1 shows a schematic of the open -label extension 
study.

Modifications to Open -Label Dosing  
If at any time an important dose- related safety signal is identified either from this study or 
DX-2930-03, the Sponsor may decide to switch the enrolled subjects who have not yet 
completed the treatment period, and any subsequent subjects, to receive a different open -label 
dose and/or frequency.  
In addition, based on the results of the DX -2930-03 study, the Sponsor may switch to a different 
dose and/or frequency.

3.1.2 Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1869]  
[IP_ADDRESS] Study Level Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_852696], including SAEs and AESI, will be monitored regularly throughout the duration of 
the study. If any potential safety signal is identified as a result of monitoring in this study, or from any safety findings from the DX-2930-03 study, or followin g DSMB review,  the Sponsor 
may take actions as deemed appropriate, including suspending dosing in the study, while the potential risk is evaluated and a course of action has been determined. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Individual Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_852697] a 
DX-2930- related SAE (or DX-2930- related, clinically significant non -serious AE) that, in the 
assessment of the investigator or DSMB recommendation, warrants discontinuation from further 
dosing for that subject’s well-being. The investigator has the ability to contact [CONTACT_852783]. Subjects will continue to be followed through the 
completion of all scheduled non-dosing visits, unless they request to be discontinued from the study. 
3.1.3 Follow- up for Subjects Meeting Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_852698] (AE, 
laboratory, physical examination, vital sign, or ECG finding) will be carefully monitored until resolution, which may include the following: 
• Additional clinical laboratory tests and/or other clinical investigations  
• Additional visits or extended duration of follow-up 
• Obtaining a specialist consultation  
 
3.2 Rationale for Open- Label Extension Dose Selection  
The dose sel ected for the open-label extension (300 mg every 2 weeks) is anticipated to be 
effective and safe as determined in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_22735], double- blind DX -2930- [ADDRESS_1185888] not yet completed the treatment 
period, and any subsequent subjects, to receive a different open- label DX-2930 dose and/or

There will be a ±[ADDRESS_1185890]- dose.  
All subjects (adole scent or adult) who are considered suitable candidates (i.e., those with a 
physical and mental capability of learning and willing to be trained) may be allowed to self-administer treatment after completing appropriate training by [CONTACT_852784]. Subjects are allowed to initiate self -administration after 
receiving the first [ADDRESS_1185891] will be provided the necessary  supplies (see Section 5.7 and Section

3.4 Study Duration for Individual Subjects  
Following informed consent, subjects will either rollover from DX-2930-03 or undergo 
screening assessments (non -rollover subjects). Screening assessments for non-rollover subjects 
must occur within [ADDRESS_1185892] open-label dose. Eligible subje cts will be enrolled 
and undergo a 350 day treatment period. At the conclusion of the 350 day treatment period, subjects will be followed for an additional 8 weeks.

Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -[ADDRESS_1185893]  50 (up to 
a maximum of 100) additional subjects who were not enrolled in DX-2930-03.  The total 
enrollment is expected to be approximately 150, but not more than [ADDRESS_1185894] angioedema has been reported in HAE patie nts as young as the age 
of 3 ( Bork et al., 2003 ). In one case series of [ADDRESS_1185895] angioedema by [CONTACT_14898] 18 ( Farkas, 2010). An important unmet medical 
need exists among children with HAE, especially adolescents, since the disease commonly worsens after puberty ( Bennett and Craig, 2015 ; Zuraw, 2008).  The study will aim to enroll at 
least [ADDRESS_1185896] meet the following criteria to be enrolled in this study:  
1. Male and female HAE subjects who are 12 years of age or older at the time of screening.  
2. Documented diagnosis of disease HAE (Type I or II) based on all of the following: 
• Documented clinical history consistent with HAE (subcutaneous or mucosal, 
nonpruritic swelling epi[INVESTIGATOR_84143]). 
• Diagnostic testing results obtained during screening (or a prior DX-2930 study) that 
confirm HAE Type I or II: C1 inhibitor (C1 -INH) functional level < 40% of the 
normal level. Subjects with functional C1- INH level 40 -50% of the normal level may 
be enrolled if they also have a C4 level below the normal range.  Subjects may be retested if results are incongruent with clinical history or believed by [CONTACT_852785].  
• At least one of the following: Age at reported onset of first angioedema symptoms 
≤ [ADDRESS_1185897] 1 attack per 12 weeks.  
4. Adult subjects and caregivers of subjects under the age of 18 are willing and able to read, 
understand, and sign an informed consent form.  Subjects age 12 to 17, whose caregiver has provided informed consent, are willing and able to read, understand and sign an assent form.

Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -[ADDRESS_1185898] adhere to contraception 
requirements for the duration of the study as follows: 
• Females of childbearing potential must agree to be abstinent or it is recommended to use 
highly effective forms of contraception from the screening period through 30 days after 
the final study visit.  This includes stable doses (for 3 months prior to study screening ) of 
combined estrogen and progestin-containing hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation (oral, injectable or implantable), progestin -only hormonal 
contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation, intra -uterine device (IUD, all types) 
or intrauterine hormone releasing systems (IUS). Notes: 1) A female whose male partner 
has had a vasectomy must agree to use one additional form of medically acceptable contraception. 2) Use of a male cond om with or without spermicide or cervical cap, 
diaphragm or sponge with spermicide or a combination (double barrier methods) are  not 
considered highly effective. 
• Females of non-childbearing potential, defined as surgically sterile (status post 
hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral tubal ligation) or post-menopausal for 
at least 12 months do not require contraception during the study. 
• Males, including males who are surgically sterile (post vasectomy), with female partners of childbearing potenti al must agree to be abstinent or else use a medically acceptable 
form of contraception from the screening period through 60 days after the final study visit.  
4.3 Exclusion Criteria  
Subjects who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from the study: 
1. Discontinued from DX-2930-03 after enrollment for any reason. 
2. If rolling over from DX -2930-03, presence of important safety concerns that would preclude 
participation in this study.  
3. Concomitant diagnosis of another form of chronic, recurrent angioedema such as acquired 
angioedema (AAE), HAE with normal C1-INH (also known as HAE Type III), idiopathic angioedema, or recurrent angioedema associated with urticaria.  
4. Dosing with an investigational drug (not including DX-2930 or other HAE therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] ) or 
exposure to an investigational device within 4 weeks prior screening.  
5. Exposure to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors within 4 weeks prior to screening or any newly initiated or dose modification of estrogen -containing medications 
with systemic absorpti on (such as oral contraceptives or hormonal replacement therapy) 3 
months prior to the screening visit. 
6. Unwilling to discontinue use of long-term prophylactic therapy for HAE (C1-INH, attenuated androgens, or anti- fibrinolytics) within 3 weeks after starting DX-2930 treatment.

5. STUDY TREATMENT(S)  
5.1 Description of Treatment(s)  
For detailed information regarding open- label DX-2930 administration, refer to the Pharmacy 
Manual.  
DX-2930 is a sterile, preservative-free solution for injection, pH 6.0. The active ingredient, 
DX-2930, is formulated using the following compendial components:  30 mM sodium phosphate dibasic dihydrate, 19.6 mM citric acid, 50 mM histidine, 90  mM sodium chloride, 0.01% 
Polysorbate 80. Each open label vial contains a nominal concentration of [ADDRESS_1185900] will receive a total of 2 mL (2 vials) , which will 
be administered in a single 2 mL SC injection. The injection will be given in the upper arm, thigh or abdomen. 
Self-Administration  
All s ubjects (adolescent or adult) who are considered suitable candidates (i.e., those with a 
physical and mental capability of learning and willing to be trained) may be allowed to self-administer treatment after completing appropriate training by [CONTACT_852786] -administer. Subjects are allowed to initiate self -
administration after receiving the first 2 doses of DX -2930 at the study site. Once initiated, 
subjects may continue to self- administer subsequent doses of DX -2930 at the investigational site 
(when visits are scheduled study site visits) or the subject’s home or other agreed upon location (when the study permits off- site dosing). See Schedule of Activities for details. Adolescent  
subjects self -administering investigational product will be supervised by a parent/legal 
guardian/caregiver. Alternatively, a parent/legal guardian/caregiver, after completing appropriate training , will be allowed to administer DX -[ADDRESS_1185901]’s medical record and eCRF regarding the subject’s experience with self -administration and SC 
administration of DX-2930. 
5.[ADDRESS_1185902] reported HAE attack.  The second dose 
of DX-2930 may be administered at an unscheduled visit if it is outside of the accepted ±4 day 
window around a scheduled visit. Following this attack subjects will receive open label SC doses 
of DX-2930 every 2 weeks until the end of the treatment period. Subsequent dosing after Dose 2 
requires a minimum of 10 days and a maximum of 18 days between administrations.

[IP_ADDRESS] Management of HAE Attacks  
Acute HAE attacks during the study are to be managed in accord with the i nvestigator’s usual 
care of their patients, including use of acute attack therapi[INVESTIGATOR_852687]. Use of C1- INH will be permitted as an acute attack therapy but not as a 
LTP therapy. Administration of DX -[ADDRESS_1185906] has symptoms of an HAE attack the 
day of DX- 2930 administration and/or receives treatment for an HAE attack . The administration 
of DX -2930 can also be re- scheduled as long as t he minimum and maximum timeframe between 
doses are met based on patient preference or physician discretion.  
 
5.4.2 Excluded Concomitant Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_852701]: 
• Long-term prophylaxis for HAE (e.g., use of C1- INH for LTP, attenuated androgens, or 
anti-fibrinolytics) once LTP is discontinued (within [ADDRESS_1185907] dose of 
DX-2930). 
• Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. 
• Initiat ing or changing the dose of estrogen -containing medications with systemic absorption 
(such as oral contraceptives or hormonal replacement therapy)  3 months prior to the 
screening visit . 
• Use of androgens (e.g., stanozolol, danazol, oxandrolone, methyltestosterone, testosterone) 
for non-HAE related medical conditions or for HAE after discontinuation  during the first 
3 weeks. 
• Any other investigational drug or device.

6.3 Demographics and Medical History   
Demographics: date of birth (alternately age or year of birth, if full date is not allowed to be collected for legal reasons), sex,  race and ethnicity (where locally permitted) and medical history will be obtained at Screening from subjects not rolling over from DX -2930-[ADDRESS_1185917]’s current medical status (current disease processes), past medical status (past disease processes), history of surgery, allergies and concomitant medications. For subjects rolling over from DX-2930-03, these data will be carried forward from that study.  
6.4 HAE Attack Information Collection  
The collection, reporting and assessment of attacks in this study will be done in accordance with the HAE Att ack Assessment and Reporting Procedures (HAARP).  Study s ite personnel will be 
trained on HAARP prior to screening and enrolling subjects at their site. 
Study site personnel will train subjects and caregivers on identifying symptoms of an attack, the 
requirements for reporting attacks and the information they will be expected to provide.  The patient (and caregiver ) will confirm their understanding of what is required of them for reporting 
attacks to the site.  
At screening, HAE attack history will be collec ted for non-rollover subjects. Information 
collected will include any prior history of laryngeal attacks, attack frequency, average severity, predominant attack location(s), triggers, average duration, acute attack therapy use and history of LTP (including  duration of LTP, medication(s) and dose used for LTP, and frequency of attacks 
 
Page 54 of 151
DX-2930 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 55 
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930 -04  27 June 2016 
 
while receiving LTP).  If available, information will also be collected on HAE diagnosis (year of 
confirmation, how many years after onset of symptoms was diagnosis confirmed, or if subject was misdiagnosed).  
During the study, subjects (or caregivers) will be instructed to notify and report details to the study site within [ADDRESS_1185918] in tracking any HAE attacks experienced.  
Subjects (or caregivers) will be asked to provide the following information when reporting an attack:  
• Date and time symptoms of an attack were first experienced  
• Description of symptoms experienced, including location(s) 
• Impact on activity (work, school, social interactions) and whether any assistance or 
medical intervention was required, including hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], additional laboratory tests, or emergency department visits 
• Any medi cations used to treat the attack  (both prescription and over the counter) 
• If the attack resolved, date and time the subject was no longer experiencing symptoms 
Study s ite personnel will review the information provided and solicit additional information as 
necessary to document the attack, as described in HAARP.  
For rollover subjects, study site personnel  will contact [CONTACT_852770]

be recorded in the eCRF.  
Emergency department visits for HAE attacks and HAE attacks resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_852688]. 
To be confirmed as an attack, the event must have symptoms or signs consistent with an attack in 
at least one of the following locations:  
• Peripheral angioedema: cutaneous swelling involving an extremity, the face, neck, torso, 
and/or genitourinary region 
• Abdominal angioedema: abdominal pain, with or without abdominal distention, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea 
• Laryngeal angioedema: stridor, dyspnea, difficulty speaking, difficulty swa llowing, throat 
tightening, or swelling of the tongue, palate, uvula, or larynx 
 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_852689], the investigator or physician designee may still 
clinically determine that the event did not represent an attack if there are features that strongly refute such a diagnosis. For example, the reported event is accompanied by [CONTACT_784432] (e.g., urticaria), the reported event persists well beyond the typi[INVESTIGATOR_852665], or there is a likely alternate etiology for the event (e.g., the subject’s abdominal symptoms are attributable to a viral gastroenteritis outbreak in the household).  
To be counted as a unique attack distinct from the previous attack, the new symptoms must occur 
at least 24 hours after resolution of the prior attack’s symptoms. 
6.5 Vital Signs  
Vital signs will be assessed by [CONTACT_15009]/her qualified designee according  to the 
Study Activities Schedule ( Appendix 1) unless the subject has elected to self -administer for that 
visit. Routine vital sign assessments will be taken with the subject in the sitting or supi[INVESTIGATOR_268672] [ADDRESS_1185921] and will include body temperature, heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP) and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] (RR). BP should be determined using the same arm and the same equipment for each assessment.  For subjects who rollover from DX -2930-03, vital signs 
taken during the f inal study visit in DX -2930-03 will serve as the Day 0 pre-dose vital signs in 
this study and will not be duplicated. 
6.6 Physical Examination  
A physical examination including height, weight and calculation of Body Mass Index (BMI) will 
be performed by [CONTACT_852787]/her qualified designee according to the Study Activities 
Schedule ( Appendix 1). The physical examination will be performed in accor dance with 
standards at the site.

For subjects who rollover from DX-2930-03, the physical exam taken during the final study visit 
in DX-2930- 03 will serve as the Day 0 pre-dose physical exam in this study and will not be 
duplicated. 
6.7 Electrocardiography ( ECG)  
A standard 12-lead ECG (single recording) will be performed according to the Study Activities 
Schedule ( Appendix 1). The date and time of each  ECG and its results will be documented in the 
source documents and eCRF. Electrocardiograms will be sent to a central reading vendor for assessment.  For subjects who rollover from DX-2930-03, the ECG taken during the final study visit in DX -2930-03 will serve as the Day 0 pre-dose ECG in this study and will not be 
duplicated. 
6.8 Clinical Laboratory Tests  
6.8.1 Laboratory Parameters 
Laboratory testing will be performed according to the Study Activities Schedule (Appendix 1).  
Laboratory testing includes general safety parameters (hematology, coagulation, urinalysis, and 
serum chemistry), pregnancy tests (in females of childbearing potential), C1-INH functional assay, C4 assay, C1q assay, PK sampling, PD sampling, and plasma anti-drug antibody testing. All laboratory tests will be performed using established and validated methods.  
When multiple sample collection types are performed at the same assessment time p oint, the 
samples will be drawn in the following order (depending on what sample types are to be 
collected at that time point): laboratory safety samples (hematology, coagulation, serum chemistry), C1 -INH, C4, C1q, PK, anti-drug antibodies , PD. Aliquots from the PK, PD and anti-
drug antibody samples may be retained as back- up for additional parameter testing if necessary. 
Subjects will be in a seated or supi[INVESTIGATOR_2526]. The total blood draw for each rollover subject will be approxima tely 269.[ADDRESS_1185922] will be approximately 283 mL. For subjects who rollover from DX-2930-03, testing 
performed during the final study visit in DX-2930- 03 will serve as the Day 0 pre- dose laboratory 
testing in this study and will not be duplicated.

Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930 -04  27 June 2016 
 
6.14.1 Angioedema Quality of Life Questionnaire (AE -QoL)  
The AE -QoL is a self -administered, symptom -specific tool developed and validated to assess 
quality of life (QoL) impairment in recurrent angioedema patients (Weller et al.  2012 ). The AE -
QoL consists of 17 questions covering four domains/dimensions (functioning, fatigue/mood, 
fear/shame, nutrition). Each of the 17 items has a five- point Likert -type response scale ranging 
from 1 (Never) to 5 (Very Of ten). The AE- QoL is scored to produce a score for each domain and 
a total score ranging from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating stronger impairment. It takes 5 minutes to complete the AE -QoL.  
6.14.2 EuroQoL 5 -Diminsional 5 -Level Measure ( EQ-5D-5L) 
The EQ -5D- 5L is a self -administered standardized measure of health status comprised of a 
descriptive system and a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). The descriptive system consists of five health related quality of life dimensions (i.e., mobility, self-care, usual activit ies, 
pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression). Each dimension is rated on a 5- point response scale 
(5 levels) indicating severity of problems, where 1 is “no problems” and 5 is “extreme 
problems”. The EQ- 5D VAS is a measure of overall self -rated health sta tus on a 20- cm vertical 
VAS with endpoints labelled “the best health you can imagine” and “the worst health you can imagine”. The VAS ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicative of better overall health. 
6.14.3 Work Productivity and Activity Impairment – General Health (WPAI -GH)  
Questionnaire  
The WPAI -GH is a [ADDRESS_1185927] 7 days. The instrument elicits four main scores in relation to general 
health specifically: absenteeism (the percentage of work time missed because of one's health in 
the past seven days), presenteeism (the percentage of impairment experienced while at work in the past seven days because of one's health), overall work productivity loss (an overall impairment  estimate that is a combination of absenteeism and presenteeism), and activity 
impairment (the percentage of impairment in daily activities because of one's health in the past 
seven days ) (Reilly et al.  1993).  
6.14.4 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_74022] D epression Scale (HADS)  
The Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5620] (HADS) is a self -assessment scale to detect states of 
depression, anxiety and emotional distress amongst patients who were being treated for a variety 
of clinical problems ( Zigmond and Snaith 1983 ). The scale has a total of 14 items. Seven of the 
items relate to anxiety and seven relate to depression.  The responses are scored on a scale of 0 –3 
(3 indicates higher symptom frequencies). Scores for each subscale (anxiety and depression) 
range from 0 to 21 with scores categorized as follows: normal 0–7, mild 8–10, moderate 11–14, and severe 15 –21. Scores for the entire scale (emotional distress) range from [ADDRESS_1185928] 
week.  
 
6.14.5 12 Item Short Form v2 Health Survey (SF-12v2) 
The SF-12v2 Health Survey is a reliable and valid generic measure of functional health and well-
being. The SF-12v2 consists of 12 questions, all selected from the SF -36 Health Survey ( Ware  et 
al. 1996). The SF-12v2 yields eight health domains (vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain,

general health perceptions, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, and m ental 
health summary measures. Physical and Mental Health Composite Scores (PCS & MCS) can be 
computed using the scores of twelve questions and range from [ADDRESS_1185929] to self -administer DX -2930 on the 
following: 
• Transportation and recommended storage conditions of investigational product from the 
study site to the home location. 
• Maintenance of accurate records regarding each administration of investigational product including supply identification (ie, lot/kit number), date and time of injection, injection 
site location, infusion time, and if applicable, any reason the self-administration  could not 
be completed as instructed.  
• Retention of all used and unused vials of investigational product for drug accountability 
purposes.
  
After receiving appropriate training and demonstrating their understanding of self-administration, subjects are allowed to self -administer DX -[ADDRESS_1185930] 2 doses 
of DX -2930 at the study site (administered by [CONTACT_3462]). For those s ubjects who choose to 
self-administer or have a parent/legal guardian/caregiver administer DX -2930, subjects must 
complete an assessment of their experience with self -administration  and subcutaneous injection 
for each dose received . Study personnel will do cument the subject’s responses in the subjects’ 
medical record and eCRF.

6.16.1 Definitions  
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical trial subject whether or not it appears to have a causal relationship with the treatment administered.  
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or participation in a clinic al study, whether or not directly related to the medicinal product or study 
participation.  
• AEs may be new events or may be pre-existing conditions that have become aggravated or 
have worsened in severity or frequency during the course of the study. 
• AEs may  be clinically significant changes from baseline in physical examination, laboratory 
tests, or other diagnostic investigation (e.g., laboratory results, x-ray findings). 
Laboratory abnormalities generally are not considered AEs unless they are associated w ith 
clinical signs or symptoms, or require medical intervention. A clinically significant laboratory 
abnormality that is independent from a known underlying medical condition and that requires medical or surgical intervention, or leads to DX-[ADDRESS_1185933] or are part of a known underlying medical condition are not, in themselves, AEs; rather, the underlying medical condition leading to th e abnormalities would be reported as the AE.  
Pregnancy is not an AE; however, if a female subject becomes pregnant during the conduct of the study, the investigator must notify the Sponsor according to the procedures provided in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious Adverse Event  
A SAE is any adverse experience occurring at any dose that results in any of the following 
outcomes: 
• Death  
• Life-threatening experience; Note: “Life -threatening” refers to a situation in which the 
subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that might have caused death if it were more severe.  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_25411]; Note: Does not 
include hospi[INVESTIGATOR_852676] 24 hours. A scheduled hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a pre-existing condition that has not worsened during participation in the study does not meet this criterion. Pre- planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_852677]/surgical procedure or routine check -ups do not meet this criterion. 
 
Page 63 of 151
DX-2930 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 64 
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930 -04  27 June 2016 
 
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity.  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect. 
• Is considered to be an important medical event defined as those that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may jeopardize the subject or may 
require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition above. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Overdose  
An overdose is defined as a significant variation from the recommended/scheduled dosage for a 
product. The dosing for this study will be conducted in a controlled clinical setting and an overdose is not anticipated. However, in the event of an accident, for this study, an overdose of DX-[ADDRESS_1185934]. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Planned Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
A hospi[INVESTIGATOR_852702]- label DX-[ADDRESS_1185935]’s medical history is considered complete. However, if the event/condition worsens during the trial, it must be reported as an AE. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Treatment -Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE)  
An AE is treatment- emergent if the onset time is after first administration of open -label DX-[ADDRESS_1185936]’s participation in 
DX-2930-[ADDRESS_1185937] open -label dose in DX -2930-04, and then subsequently 
reappeared in DX-2930-04 will be counted as a new TEAE in DX-2930-04. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI)  
Adverse events of special interest (AESI) will be captured and monitored during this study. 
Investigators will report all AESI to the Sponsor , regardless of causality, using the same 
timelines as described for SAE reporting.  The following describe the AESI and the criteria for 
reporting AESI.  H
YPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS  
As hypersensitivity reactions have been observed for monoclonal antibodies as a class, these 
events are considered AESI for this study. Investigators will report all diagnoses, or signs and symptoms when diagnoses cannot be determined, that are consistent with hypersensitivity reactions, regardless of causality, within [ADDRESS_1185938] ed to be related to study drug.

DX-2930 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 65 
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930 -04  27 June 2016 
 
EVENTS OF DISORDERED COAGULATION  
Bleeding AESI 
Although aPTT prolongation due to plasma kallikrein inhibition is an artifactual in vitro  
phenomenon, as a precautionary measure in evaluating the safety of DX-2930, bleeding events 
will be reported as AESI for this study. Investigators will report all diagnoses, or signs and 
symptoms when diagnoses cannot be determined, that are consistent with a clinical event of bleeding. Coagulation testing (aPTT, PT, INR) should be performed when possible, and when temporally reasonable, with any reports of bleeding or for clinical conditions possibly indicative of bleeding. 
Hypercoagulable AESI 
Investigators will report all diagnoses, or signs and symptoms when diagnoses cannot be 
determined, that are consistent with a thrombotic or embolic etiology.  
6.16.2 Monitoring  
[IP_ADDRESS] Monitoring of Adverse Events 
Each subject will be monitored for the occurrence of AEs, including SAEs and AESI, from 
signing of the ICF through the final follow-up visit. 
• Subjects will be questioned and/or examined by [CONTACT_1720] a qualified designee for 
evidence of AEs. The questioning of subjects with regard to the possible occurrence of AEs 
will be generalized such as, "How have you been feeling since your last visit?”  The presence or absence of specific AEs should not be elicited from subjects.  
• Subjects having TEAEs will be monitored until resolution with relevant clinical assessments 
and laboratory tests, as determined by [CONTACT_093]. 
• AEs, actions taken as a result of AEs, and follow- up results must be recorded in the eCRF as 
well as in the subject's source documentation. Follow-up laboratory results should be filed 
with the subject's source documentation. 
 For any SAEs or AEs that requ ire the subject to be discontinued from dosing, relevant clinical 
assessments and laboratory tests will be repeated as clinically appropriate, until final resolution or stabilization of the event(s). Subjects will continue to be followed through completion of all scheduled visits.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Monitoring of Safety Laboratory Assessments 
All safety laboratory assessments will be performed at a central laboratory. The clinical laboratory values will be reported to the i nvestigator who will review them for clinical 
signifi cance and consideration of abnormal values as potential AEs.

Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930 -04  27 June 2016 
 
6.16.3 Assessment of Adverse Events 
[IP_ADDRESS] Assessment of Severity  
The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event (as in mild, 
moderate, or severe myocardial infarction ); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor 
medical significance (such as severe nausea). This is not the same as “serious,” which is based on subject/event outcome or action criteria usually associated with events that pose a threat to a subject’s life or functioning.  
In this study, the severity of AEs will be assessed according to Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) Adult Toxicity Table, Draft, November 2007 (US National Institutes of Health: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases) ( Appendix 2) and the 
Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) Pediatric Toxicity Table, Draft, November 2007 (US National Institutes of Health: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases) ( Appendix 3). For abnormalities not specifically found in the Toxicity Tables, the 
following general scale will be used to estimate grade of severity:  
• GRADE 1 (Mild): Transient or mild discomfort; no medical intervention/therapy required  
• GRADE 2 (Moderate): Mild to moderate limitation in activity - some assistance may be 
needed; no or minimal medical intervention/therapy required 
• GRADE 3 (Severe): Marked limitation in activity, some assistance usually required; medical 
intervention/therapy required, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29125]  
• GRADE 4 (Life -threatening): Extreme  limitation in activity, significant assistance required; 
significant medical intervention/therapy required, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_852703]-emergent ECG abnormality that is considered by [CONTACT_941] i nvestigator as clinically 
significant a nd requiring intervention/therapy will be assessed as a severe AE.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Assessment of Causality  
A medically qualified investigator must assess the relationship of any AE (including SAEs) to 
the use of DX-2930, as related or not related, based on clinical judgment and using all available information, and may include consideration of the following factors: 
• Possible alternative causes of the AE, including the disease under treatment, pre-existing conditions, concomitant use of other drugs, and presence of environme ntal or genetic factors.  
• The temporal association between DX-2930 exposure and onset of the AE. 
• Whether the manifestations of the AE are consistent with known actions or toxicity of 
DX-2930. 
• The AE resolved or improved with decreasing the dose or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_852681]-2930 (dechallenge). Judgment should be used if multiple products are discontinued at the same 
time.  
 The causal relationship between DX-2930 and the AE will be assessed using one of the 
following categories: 
 
Page 66 of 151
DX-2930 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 67 
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930 -04  27 June 2016 
 
Not Related:  Factors consistent with an assessment of Not Related include:  
• Temporal relationship is lacking (e.g., the event did not occur within a reasonable 
time frame following administration of DX-2930 ); or 
• Other causative factors more likely explain the event (e.g., a pre -existing 
condition, other concomitant treatments). 
Related:   Factors consistent with an assessment of Related include:  
• There is a positive temporal relationship (e.g., the event occurred within a reasonable time frame following administration of DX-2930); or 
• The AE  is more likely explained by [CONTACT_852747]-2930 than by [CONTACT_31206] (i.e., the AE shows a pattern consistent with previous knowledge of 
DX-2930 or the class of DX-2930).  
[IP_ADDRESS] Assessment of Clinical Significance  
Clinical significance of individual AEs will be determined by [CONTACT_093], with discussion 
with the Medical Monitor as appropriate.  
6.16.4 Clinical Laboratory Adverse Events 
Laboratory abnormalities generally are not considered AEs unless they are associated  with 
clinical signs or symptoms, or require medical intervention. A clinically significant laboratory abnormality that is independent from a known underlying medical condition and that requires medical or surgical intervention, or leads to DX-2930 interru ption or discontinuation, will be 
considered an AE. 
When laboratory abnormalities are considered to be AEs, the DMID Adult Toxicity Table 
(Appendix 2 ) or DMID Pediatric Toxicity Tables (Appendix 3) will be used to assess severity. 
Where discrepancies in the upper limit of normal (ULN) and lowe r limit of normal (LLN) of 
laboratory ranges occur between those included in the DMID tables and those of the laboratory that performs the assays, the values provided by [CONTACT_247765]. Clinical significance of  individual laboratory AEs will be determined by [CONTACT_852793].  
Following is an exception to defining clinically significant, abnormal laboratory values as AEs: 
• APTT prolongation in the absence of any assoc iated bleeding or other evidence of clinical 
relevance will not be considered a clinically significant laboratory abnormality or AE. In the 
appropriate physiologic setting, such as IV heparin therapy, aPTT can be used to monitor bleeding risk. However, as noted in the Investigators Brochure, aPTT prolongation due to plasma kallikrein inhibition is an artifactual in vitro  phenomenon. Although plasma kallikrein 
drives fibrin formation in the aPTT assay, plasma kallikrein-driven coagulation does not appear to have hemostatic or other physiologically important functions in vivo . It is well 
documented that, in humans, deficiency of factor XII or prekallikrein (and thus plasma kallikrein) is not associated with abnormal bleeding, either spontaneous or during surgi cal 
procedures ( Renne and Gruber, 2012) . Despi[INVESTIGATOR_852682], deficiency of either 
protein is associated w ith marked prolongation of the aPTT.

6.16.5 Reporting Investigator Safety Observations to the Sponsor 
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting Non- serious Adverse Events  
All AEs, regardless of seriousness, severity, or causal relationship to DX-2930, will be recorded 
on the AE page of the eCRF. In this study all HAE attacks reported by [CONTACT_423], regardless of 
whether or not they are confirmed by [CONTACT_941] i nvestigator, will be captured as AEs.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting Pregnancies  
If a female subject or the female partner of a male subject becomes pregnant du ring the course of 
the study, the investigator must report the pregnancy to the Sponsor’s Pharmacovigilance Department using the Pregnancy Reporting Form within [ADDRESS_1185939] pregna ncy information (including the 
status of the newborn, if applicable). 
If some of the information required for completion of the Pregnancy Reporting Form is 
unavailable at the time of the initial report, follow -up reports will be completed and submitted 
within 24 hours of becoming aware of the new information. The i nvestigator is required to 
follow the pregnancy through delivery. The outcome of the pregnancy and the status of the newborn (if applicable) will be reported on the Pregnancy Reporting Form within  24 hours of 
becoming aware.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Safety Observations Requiring Expedited Reporting by [CONTACT_852794] a subject in the trial must be reported expeditiously by [CONTACT_941] i nvestigator or qualified d esignee to the Sponsor’s Pharmacovigilance 
Department:  
• SAE  
• AESI  
• Overdose 
• Cancer  
 The investigator is to report any expedited safety observations from the list above to the Sponsor 
using the SAE Reporting Form in the EDC system within [ADDRESS_1185940]'s source documentation along with any actions taken. If all required information on the form is not available at the time of the initial report, follow -up information will be completed in the EDC 
system.  
The investigator is required to follow SAEs until resolution regardless of whether the subjects

9. DATA ANALYSIS / STATISTICAL METHODS  
9.1 General  Considerations 
All statistical analyses will be performed using SAS® Version 9.3 or higher (SAS Institute, Cary, 
North Carolina, [LOCATION_003]). 
For categorical variables, the number and percentage of subjects within each category (with a 
category for missing data as needed) of the parameter will be presented. For continuous variables, the number of subjects, mean, median, standard deviation (SD), minimum, and maximum values will be presented. Where applicable, estimates from statistical model of least squares means, standard errors, and 95% confidence intervals for least squares means will be provided. Time- to-event data will be summarized using Kaplan -Meier estimates of the 25th, 50th 
(median), and 75th percentiles with associated two-sided 95% confidence intervals , as well as 
percentage of censored observations. Plots of the Kaplan -Meier curves and supporting data 
listings detailing each subject’s contribution to the analysis will be provided.  
Formal hypothesis testing will not be performed.  Any hypothesis testing will be exploratory in nature and resulting p- values will be considered descriptive.  
9.2 Sample Size Determination  
No formal sample size calculation was performed.  The sample size is not based on any 
statistical considerations.  This study is designed  to evaluate the safety and efficacy of open -label 
treatment with DX -2930 in subjects who participated in DX-2930-03 (rollover subjects) and 
individuals who were not otherwise able to participate in DX-2930-03 ( non-rollover subjects) . 
9.3 Method of Assigning Study Subjects to Treatment  
Subjects meeting all eligibility criteria will be enrolled in the study and sequentially assigned a 
unique site-based identification number. 
9.4 Analysis Populations  
9.4.1 Safety Population 
The Safety Population will include all subjects who received any study drug after entering the 
DX-2930-04 study (i.e., any exposure to open- label DX -2930).   Unless otherwise specified, 
summary tabulations conducted with the Safety Population will be presented by [CONTACT_423]’s 
study entry type (rollover or non-rollover) and overall. 
9.4.2 Rollover Safety Population  
The Rollover Safety Population is the subset of subjects who participated in the DX-2930-03 
study and received any study drug after entering the DX-2930-04 study (i.e., any exposure to open- label DX -2930). Unless otherwise specified, summary tabulations conducted with the 
Rollover Safety Population will be presented by [CONTACT_423]’s prior treatment group from the DX-2930-03 study (DX-2930 300 mg every 2 weeks, DX-2930 300 mg every 4 weeks, DX-2930 150 mg every 4 weeks, and Placebo).

(WHO -DD) .  The number and percentage of subjects with prior or concomitant medications will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_852799].  A separate, 
similar table will be provided for the subset of concomitant medications  classified as rescue 
medications.  
9.[ADDRESS_1186002] investigator-confirmed HAE attack (days) will be calculated from the date and 
time of the first open -label dose of DX -[ADDRESS_1186003] on -study investigator -confirmed HAE attack will be censored at the 
 
Page 93 of 151
DX-2930 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 94 
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -[ADDRESS_1186004] investigator-confirmed HAE attack, including but not limited to: baseline attack rate prior to entering DX -2930-03, the 
treatment group in DX-2930-03, the time since the last dose given in DX-2930-03, the time since the last HAE attack, and the rate of attacks during DX-2930-03. Results of this exploratory analysis will be summarized.   
9.6.2 Number of Investigator- confirmed HAE Attacks  
The number of investigator-confirmed HAE attacks during the treatment period (Day 0 through 
Day 350) expressed  as a monthly HAE attack rate, will be analyzed using each analysis 
population. 
The treatment period investigator -confirmed HAE attack rate will be calculated for each subject 
as the number of investigator-confirmed HAE attacks occurring during the treatment period 
divided by [CONTACT_852773] [ADDRESS_1186005]. 
In addition, the number of investigator-confirmed HAE attacks per month (defined as 28 days) 
will be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_24473] (per 28 day interval) for each analysis population. The summary will include the number, change from baseline, and percent change from baseline of investigator-confirmed HAE attacks. Investigator-confirmed HAE attacks will be grouped into 28-day intervals using the start date of the HAE attack. The date of the first exposure to study drug in this study will be used as the start of the first interv al and end of the interval will be the 
date of first exposure to study drug in this study plus [ADDRESS_1186006] day of the prior interval plus 1 day and end 28 days later.  
Similar summary tables will be presented for the following efficacy endpoints for each analysis 
population: 
• Number of investigator- confirmed HAE attacks requiring acute treatment during the 
treatment period.  
 
Page 94 of 151
DX-2930 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 95 
Clinical Trial Protocol: DX -2930 -04  27 June 2016 
 
• Number of moderate or severe investigator -confirmed HAE attacks during the treatment 
period. 
• Number of high-morbidity investigator- confirmed HAE attacks during the treatment period; 
a high-morbidity HAE attack is defined as any attack that has at least one of the following 
characteristics: severe, results in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (except hospi[INVESTIGATOR_28061] < 24 
hours), hemodynamically significant (systolic blood pressure < 90, requires IV hydration, or associated with syncope or near -syncope) or laryngeal.

exposure to open- label DX -2930 in this study, or medical conditions present prior to the start of 
treatment but increasing in severity or relationship at the time of or following the start of treatment. For AEs with partial onset times, non -missing date parts will be used to determine if 
the AE is treatment -emergent or not.  If a determin ation cannot be made using the non-missing 
date parts as to when the AE occurred relative to study drug administration, then the AE will be classified as treatment -emergent.   
The analyses described in this section will be based on treatment -emergent AEs; plainly referred 
to as AEs in this section for brevity.    Related AEs are AEs classified as related to study drug by [CONTACT_093].  Severe AEs are AEs classified as severe (grade 3) or life threatening (grade 4) by [CONTACT_093].  
 For this analysis, AEs will be classified to one of three analysis periods:  
• Pretreatment Period AEs will include AEs starting at or after informed consent to those 
starting before the first exposure to open- label DX -2930 in this study (AEs starting prior to 
treatment on D ay 0).  This analysis period is only applicable for the Non-rollover Safety 
Population in this study.  
• Treatment Period AEs will include all AEs starting at or after the first exposure to open -label 
DX-[ADDRESS_1186008]’s last visit date during the 
treatment period in this study (AEs starting at or after treatment on Day 0 to the Day 350 
visit).  
• Follow-up Period AEs will include all AEs starting at or after the subject’s last visit date of 
the treatment period in  this study (AEs starting after the Day 350 visit).

Quality of life assessments will be summarized using the Safety Population.  
 
The number and percentage of subjects at each level of the E Q-5D-5L dimensions (mobility, 
self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) will be summarized by [CONTACT_364825]. In addition, the VAS score for the subject’s self -rated health will be summarized by [CONTACT_364825].   
 The responses to the SF-12 for each item will be tabulated by [CONTACT_852804].  In addition, Physical and Mental Health Composite Scores (PCS & MCS) will be 
computed using the scores of twelve questions and range from [ADDRESS_1186013] level of 
health.  Responses to the HADS for each item will be tabulated by [CONTACT_15449]. In addition, continuous and categorical (0 -7: normal , 8-10: mild , 11-14: moderate, 15 -21: severe ) total scores based on 
the items related to depression and anxiety, will be summarized by [CONTACT_15449].  Each item in the 
questionnaire is scored from 0 -3, with total scores between 0-21 for either depression or anxiety.  
Scores for the entire scale (emotional distress) will also be presented.  Total score for the entire scale range from 0 to 42, with higher scores indicating more distress.  Responses to the WPAI -GH for each item will be summarized by [CONTACT_15449].  In addition, four 
main scores in relation to general health will be summarized by [CONTACT_15449]. Scores will be 
calculated as absenteeism (percentage work time missed due to health), presenteeism (percent 
impairment while working due to health), work productivity loss ( percent overall w ork 
impairment due to health) , and activity impairment (percent activity impairment due to health).  
The scores are percentages with higher values indicating  greater percentage impairment.   Only 
respondents who report being full- time or part-time employed provide data for absenteeism, 
presenteeism, and overall work productivity loss.  All respondents provide data for activity impairment.    
 Responses to the AE -QoL for each item will be tabulated by [CONTACT_15449].  In addition, the domain 
scores (functioning, fatigue/mood, fears/shame, nutrition) and total score will be summarized by

calculated using a linear transformation to a 0 -100 scale.  
 
9.9 Statistical/Analytic Considerations 
9.9.[ADDRESS_1186014] completed 12 months 
of consecutive exposure to DX-2930 across the combined DX-2930-03 and DX-2930-04 studies, 
and only after database lock of the DX-2930-03 study.  Subsequent interim analyses may be conducted to support  administrative decisions and/or regulatory reporting as required.   
 An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) has been established to provide ongoing, independent review and assessment of the safety data for the DX-2930-03 study. While 
an independent DSMB is not currently planned for this study, summary safety data from DX-2930-04 may be reviewed by [CONTACT_852771] -2930-03 study as part of the 
collection of safety information available on DX-2930.  
9.9.2 Multiple Comparisons/Multiplicity  
No adjustment for multiple comparisons will be performed.  Any statistical testing will be 
considered exploratory. 
9.9.[ADDRESS_1186015] investigator -confirmed HAE attack  will 
be explored to identify and assess the importance of potential prognostic factors. 9.9.5 Multicenter Studies  
Data from all study sites that participate in this protocol will be combined so that an adequate 
number of subjects will be available for analysis.  
9.9.6 Subgroup Analyses  
Subgroup analyses are planned for the number of investigator-confirmed HAE attacks during the 
treatment period and adverse events using the Safety Population.  
The following subgroups will be used: 
• Age Group (<18, 18 to <40, 40 to <65, ≥65 years) 
• Sex (Male, Female)  
• Race Group (White, Other)  
• Weight Group (<50, 50 to <75, 75 to <100, ≥100 kg)

19. Screened non -rollover subjects (adults and adolescents) who are on LTP with C1 INH therapy for HAE can continue their current LTP until Da y 8 (or Day 15) such that
subjects will have received 2 (or 4) doses of C1 INH.  For subjects who are on attenuated androgens (e.g., danazol) or anti-fibrinolytics (e.g., tranexamic acid), a similar
tapering schedule is recommended. However, the taper can be prolonged by [CONTACT_852775] -fibrinolytic therapy is stopped within [ADDRESS_1186036] and second open -label doses is required. If the second dose is to be administered within the accepted ±4 day window around a
scheduled study visit, this treatment visit will represent that scheduled visit unless that scheduled visit has already occurred. If that scheduled visit has already occurred, or if
the second dose is to be administered outside of the accepted ± [ADDRESS_1186037] any scheduled visit and will thus represent an
acceptable, extra study visit (i.e., an unscheduled visit). Regardless, at the visit in which the second open -label dose of DX- [ADDRESS_1186038] will undergo pre -
dose assessments for vital signs, physical examination (performed in accordance with standards at the site), clinical laboratory testing, PK, PD, and anti-drug antibody. Vital
signs will be obtained at [ADDRESS_1186039] -
dosing. As with all study visits, information will be collected on adverse events, concomitant therapy, and HAE attack data.
22. All subjects (adolescent or adult) who are considered suitable candidates (i.e., those with a physical and mental capability of learning and willing to be trained) may be
allowed to self -administer DX -[ADDRESS_1186040] to self -administer subsequent doses of DX-2930 at the investigational site
(during scheduled study site visits; shaded columns).
23. Subjects may self-administer DX -2930 at home or other agreed upon location (during optional off-
site self -administration visits; non -shaded columns). Site personnel will call
subjects after the planned self -administration to ensure the administration occurred, to collect AEs, concomitant medications, and to ensure all attacks have been appropriately
documented.
24. Samples for C1 -INH, C4, and C1q assays will be obtained at s creening for eligibility assessment unless already collected as part of protocol DX -[ADDRESS_1186041] dose.  Tests
performed at screening and on indicated visits can be serum or urine -based.
26. There is a recommended ± [ADDRESS_1186042] from the investigative site at optional off -site visits (indicated non -shaded columns). Height and weight will be
collected at the Screening visit only.

27. Physical examinations will be conducted for all rollover and non- rollover subjects according to the study activities schedule and in accordance with standards at the site.  In
addition to the physical examinations specified in the study activities schedule, an additional phys ical examination (performed in accordance with standards at the site) will be
conducted for rollover subjects prior to dosing on the day of their second open -label dose, at whatever study visit that occurs.
28. Clinical laboratory testing will include Hematology, Coagulation, Serum Chemistry, and Urinalysis (urinalysis does not need to be done as part of the clinical laboratory
testing at Visits 14, 17, 20, and 23). Clinical laboratory testing will be conducted for all rollover and non -rollover subjects according to the study activities schedule.  In
addition to the testing specified in the study activities schedule, additional testing will be conducted for rollover subject s prior to dosing on the day of their second open -label
dose, at whatever study visit that occurs.
29. Historical HAE attack information will be collected at screening. During the study, subjects (or caregivers) are instructed t o report details of the attack to the study site within
[ADDRESS_1186043]’s injection reports of their exper ience with DX -[ADDRESS_1186044]’s injection surveys of their experience with DX-2930 self-administration and subcutaneous injection for indicated visits.
33. PK, PD and Anti -drug Antibody PD samples will be drawn for all rollover and non -rollover subjects according to the study activities schedule.  In addition to the samples
specified in the study activities schedule, an additional PK, PD and Anti -drug Antibody sample will be drawn for rollover subjects prior to dosing on the day of their second
open -label dose, at whatever study visit that occurs.

DISEASES (DMID) ADULT TOXICITY TABLE  
NOVEMBER 2007  
DRAFT
Note:   The following toxicity table is  a DRAFT and designed to provide general guidance 
on parameters  for monitoring safety in clinical trials.   This toxicity table is not  comprehensive and 
should not be applie d directly  to all trials.    
When selecting a toxicity table, 
the following are some of the items that must be taken into 
consideration:  
•The population being studied
oDoes the clinical trial eval
uate healthy subjects , subject s with a particular disease
or condition?
•The stage of test article devel
opment
oIs the clinical tr ial a Pha
se I, II, III or IV?
•The type of  test article
oDoes the clinical trial eval
uate a drug,  device,  vaccine or  other biologic agent?
•The prior human and preclinical ex
perience with the test article
oAre there any specific findings t
hat require adjustment of  the toxicity table?
Single site clinical trials
 evaluating healthy subjects s hould conform to the laboratory normal 
values  at the single site. Multi -center clinical trials should reconcile among their laboratory normal 
values when evaluating a healthy volunteer population.  
Please confer with the DMID
 protocol team and DMID's Office of Clinical Research Affairs  when 
selecting or developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a toxicity table for a DMID -sponsored trial.

ESTIMATING SEVERITY GRAD E  
For abnormalities NOT found elsewhere in the Toxicity Tables use the scale below to estimate grade of severity:  
GRADE 1  Mild    Transient or mild discomfort  
 (< 48 hours); no m edical
 intervention/therapy required  
GRADE 2  Moderate   Mild to moderate limitation in 
activity - some assistance may be needed; no or minimal 
medical intervention/therapy required  
GRADE 3  Sever e    Marked limitation in activity, some 
assistance usually requ ired; medical intervention/therapy 
required, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_281925] 4  Life-threatening  Extreme limitation in activity, 
significant assistance required; significant medical intervention/therapy required, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_281926] -THREATENING AEs  
 
ANY clinical event deemed 
by [CONTACT_135956] -threatening should be 
considered a grade  4 event.  Clinical events considered to be serious or life -threatening 
include, but are not limited to:  seizures, coma , tetany, diabetic ketoacidosis, 
disseminated intravascular coagulation, diffuse petechiae, paralysis, acute psychosis, 
severe depression.  
 
COMMENTS REGARDING THE USE OF THESE TAB LES  
 
• Standardized and commonly used toxicity tables (Division of AIDS, NCI’ s 
Common Toxicity Criter
ia (CTC), and World Health Organization (WHO)) have 
been adapted for use by [CONTACT_71513] 
(DMID) and modified to better meet the needs of participants in DMID trials.  
 
•  For parameters not 
included in the following Toxicity Tables, sites should refer to 
the “Guide For Estimating Severity Grade”  located above.  
 
• Criteria are generally 
grouped by [CONTACT_6764].  
 
• Some protocols may ha
ve additional protocol specific grading criteria, which will 
supercede the use of these tables for specified criteria.

DISEASES (DMID) PEDIATRIC  TOXICIT Y TABLES  
NOVEMBER  2007 
DRAFT  
 1  
 
Note:   The following toxicity table is  a DRAFT and designed to provide general guidance 
on parameters  for monitoring safety in clinical trials.   This toxicity table is not  comprehensive and should 
not be applie d directly  to all trials.    
  
When selecting a toxicity table, 
the following are some of the items that must be taken into consideration:  
  
• The population being studied  
o Does the clinical trial evaluat
e healthy subjects , subject s with a particular disease or 
condition?  
• The stage of test article dev elopment  
o Is the clinical tr ial a Phase I  (is 
it for the fisrt time in human subjects?) , II, III or IV?  
• The type of  test article   
o Does the clinical trial evaluat
e a drug,  device,  vaccine or  other biologic agent?  
• The prior human and preclinical ex
perience with the  test article  
o Are there any specific findings that 
require adjustment of  the toxicity table?  
o Has it been approved for this indic
ation in adult population?  
  
Single site clinical trials 
evaluating healthy subjects s hould conform to the laboratory normal values  at the 
single site. Multi -center clinical trials should reconcile among their laboratory normal values when 
evaluating a healthy volunteer population.  
  
Please confer with the DMID
 protocol team and DMID's Office of Clinical Research Affairs  when selecting 
or developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a toxicity table for a DMID -sponsored trial.

ESTIMATING SEVERITY GRAD E  
For abnormalities NOT found elsewhere in the Toxicity Tables use the scale below to estimate 
grade of severity:  
GRADE 1  Mild    Transient or mild discomfort  
 (< 48 hours); no medical intervention/therapy required  
GRADE 2  Moderate   Mild to moderate limitation in activity - 
some assistance may be needed; no or minimal medical intervention/therapy required  
GRADE 3  Sever e    Marked limitation in activity, some 
assistance usually required; medical intervention/therapy required, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_126691] 4  Life-threatening  Extreme limitation in activity, significant 
assistance  required; significant medical intervention/therapy 
required, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_852704] 5                              Death  
 
SERIOUS OR LIFE- THREATENING AEs  
 
ANY clinical event dee
med by [CONTACT_135956] -threatening  should be 
considered a grade  4 event.  Clinical events considered to be serious or life -threatening include, 
but are not limited to:  seizures, coma, tetany, diabetic ketoacidosis, disseminated intravascular 
coagulation, diffuse petechiae, paralysis, acut e psychosis, severe depression.  
 
COMMENTS REGARDING THE USE OF THESE TAB LES  
 
• Standardized and commo
nly used toxicity tables (Division of AIDS, NCI’s Common 
Toxicity Criteria (CTC), and World Health Organization (WHO)) have been adapted for 
use by [CONTACT_852812] d Infectiou s Di seases (DMID) an d m odified to 
better meet the needs of participants in DMID trials.  
 •  
For parameters not in
cluded in the following Toxicity Tables, sites should refer to the 
“Guide For Estimating Severity Grade”  located above.  
 • 
Criteria are generally 
grouped by [CONTACT_6764].  
 
• Some protocols may have additional protocol specific grading criteria, which will 
supercede the use
 of these tables for specified criteria.

1 PURPOSE 
This document applies to clinical trials that involve investigator adjudication/assessment of 
angioedema attacks. The purpose of this document is to provide a definition of an HA E 
attack and to define a standardized set of procedures for the reporting and assessment of events reported by [CONTACT_852814].  
[ADDRESS_1186113] one of the following locations:  
• Peripheral angioedema: cutaneous swelling involving an extremity, the face, neck, torso, 
and/or genitourinary region 
• Abdominal angioedema: abdominal pain, with or without abdominal distention, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea 
• Laryngeal angioedema: stridor, dyspnea, difficulty speaking, difficulty swallowing, throat tightening, or swelling of the tongue, palate, uvula, or larynx 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_852689], the inv estigator may still determine clinically that 
the event did not represent an HAE attack if there are features that strongly refute such a 
diagnosis. For example, the reported event is accompanied by [CONTACT_852815] (e.g., urticaria), the reported event persists well beyond the typi[INVESTIGATOR_852714] (e.g., greater than 7 days), or there is a likely alternate etiology  for 
the event (e.g., the subject’s abdominal symptoms are attributable to a viral gastroenteritis outbreak in the household). 
To be counted as a unique attack distinct from their previous attack, the new symptoms must 
occur at least 24 hours after resolution of the prior attack’s symptoms.  
Attack resolution is defined as the subject no longer having symptoms of the attack. Prodromal symptoms by [CONTACT_852816]. Patient report of use of acute HAE attack treatment for an attack by [CONTACT_852817].  
[ADDRESS_1186114] HAE attack history will be collected by [CONTACT_852818]. Information collected will include any prior history of laryngeal attacks, attack frequency, average severity, predominant location(s), average duration, acute attack therapy use, and history of long- term prophylaxis.  
During the relevant study periods, as defined in the applicable study protocol, subjects (or caregivers, for subjects < 18 years old) will be instructed to c ontact the site within [ADDRESS_1186115] is incapacitated and is

subject uses to track this information are not intended to serve as source documents for the study.  
Site personnel will review the information provided by [CONTACT_852819].  Information documented by [CONTACT_852820].  
A designated individual at the site (the collector) will contact [CONTACT_34658] a 
regular basis as defined in the study protocol, regardless of whether or not the subject has 
reported any attacks, in order to solicit for any attacks that may have occurred but were not reported. In addition, during each study visit, site personnel will solicit for any new attack information that was not provided through previous contact [CONTACT_222198] . 
The Investigator or designee (the assessor) will review the attack information  and evaluate if 
the event represents a confirmed HAE attack. If necessary for the evaluation, the investigator or designee may contact [CONTACT_852821].  
3.[ADDRESS_1186117]-Reported Symptoms 
Subjects and caregivers can use any exi sting methods by [CONTACT_852822] , or, if requested, memory aids can be provided by [CONTACT_3452]. However, 
subjects (or a caregiver) will need to track attacks in such a way as to be able to contact [CONTACT_523083], but not later than 72 hours (3 full days) after the first symptoms appear, to report the information. 
3.1.[ADDRESS_1186118] (or caregiver) at the time they 
are reporting an attack to the site: 
• Date and time symptoms of an attack were first experienced  
• Description of symptoms experienced, including location(s)

including hospi[INVESTIGATOR_623464]  
• Any medications used to treat the attack  
• If the attack resolved, date and time the subject was no longer experiencing symptoms  
Subjects do not have to wait for their symptoms to completely resolve to report an attack. 
Information about ongoing symptoms can be obtained by [CONTACT_852823]- in call 
and/ or at a scheduled study visit. Subjects should not withhold or delay any treatment they would normally receive to treat their attack in order contact [CONTACT_779].

•If  the subject experienced anything different than their typi[INVESTIGATOR_852715]
•If there were any possible alternative etiologies of the symptoms. For example, a viralgastroenteritis outbreak in the household could explain abdominal symptoms
The overall severity of the subject’s attack will be determined by [CONTACT_852825]: 
- Mild: Transient or mild discomfort  
- Moderate: Mild to moderate limitation in activity - some assistance needed

The site will also document the date and time of investigator or designee review, the official 
designation of the event as an attack or not, and if applicable, the reason why an event is not considered an attack.  
All reported attacks will be entered by [CONTACT_852826] 
(eCRF ). 
3.2.[ADDRESS_1186126] HAE attacks will 
need to pass a “Collector” training assessment covering the following: 
•definition of an HAE attack
•requirements of subjects and caretakers for reporting attacks
•reporting worsening symptoms and multiple attacks
•information to be collected from subjects and caregivers as well as the additional probing
questions to gather context for the attack information provided
•assessment of attack severity
•entry of the attack data into the eCRF
•reporting HAE attacks as adverse events
•requirements for Investigator assessment of attacks
Trainings will be conducted prior to sites screening subjects.  Trainings will be documented 
in the Trial Master File. Investigators and designees will be trained on these procedures as 
well and must pass an “Assessor” training in order to officially assess attacks for this study. 
All responsible persons involved in the collection of information from subjects or assessing attacks must be listed on FDA Form 1572.

The assessor must review the information and determine whether the event is an actual attack 
or not. If needed, the assessor can contact [CONTACT_3184]/or caregiver to clarify infor mation 
or ask for any additional detail. The determination will be documented along with the date and time the determination was made. Any event deemed not an attack must be accompanied by [CONTACT_852827].  
When rev iewing subject information, the assessor will follow the definitions of an attack as 
outlined in these procedures and, taking all available information about the event into 
consideration, will determine if it is a confirmed attack. The assessment of the attack is the Investigator or designee’s own, and not the opi[INVESTIGATOR_121479], the subject’s caregiver or any other site personnel. Assessors may consult with one another about a particular subject’s attack but only one assessor makes the documented determination.

Clinical Trial Protocol: DX- 2930 -04 27 June 2016
Appendix 5 Summary of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_852692] -2930 in HAE Subjects
The proposed pi[INVESTIGATOR_306339]  (DX -2930- 03) is entitled “HEL P StudyTM: A Multicenter, 
Randomized, Double -Blind, Placebo -Controlled Efficacy  and Safety  Study  to Evaluate DX -[ADDRESS_1186129] Acute Attacks of Hereditary  Angioedema (HAE).” This 
study  will be a multi -center, double- blind, randomized, placebo -controlled parallel -arm study  
evaluating the efficacy  of DX -2930 in preventing acute angioedema attacks in pat ients with Ty pe 
I or T ype II HAE. The double -blind study  is planned to be followed by  [CONTACT_852828], an open -label extension (OLE) study (DX-2930- 04).
The primary  objective of study  DX-2930- 03 is to evaluate the efficacy  of DX -2930 in preventing 
HAE attacks. The secondary  objective is to evaluate the safet y of repeated SC administrations of 
DX-2930. The tertiary  objectives are to evaluate the pharmacody namic effects of chronically  
administered DX -2930; to assess the immunogenic ity of chronically  administered DX -2930; to 
evaluate the pharmacokinetics of chronically  administered DX -
2930; and to evaluate the effect 
of DX -[ADDRESS_1186130] 4 weeks. HAE subjects 
will then be randomized 2:1 to receive repeated subcutaneous (SC) administrations of DX -2930 
or placebo in a double -blind fashion.  Subjects who are randomized to DX -2930 will be assigned 
in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of three dose regimens: [ADDRESS_1186131] s may  consent to rollover into the OLE study  (present protocol DX -
2930- 04) upon 
completion of their participation in the double -blind treatment period.
The primary  endpoint will be to compare the mean rate of investigator-confirmed HAE attacks 
observed in each DX -2930 treatment arm to that in the placebo arm during the efficacy  
assessment period (Day  14 through Day  182).

Figure 2:Overview of the Design of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_852691]-2930-03
Dose Rationale for Double -Blind, Pi[INVESTIGATOR_852686]-2930 -03
The dose rationale is based on the pharmacod ynamic bioactivity, PK, safety, and efficacy of DX -
2930 from the Phase 1 clinical studies and nonclinical studies. Together, these attributes provide 
the rationale for the selected doses and regimens to achieve drug levels likely  to prevent a 
majority  of HAE attacks. Based on these considerations, 300 mg every  2 weeks, 300 mg every  4 
weeks, and 150 mg every 4 weeks were identified as the dosing regimens for evaluation,
The 3 proposed dose -regimen combinations provide a 6 -fold range of steady -state trough 
concentrations and leverage both the biomarker and efficacy  data generated in study  DX-2930-
02. Evaluation of the DX- 2930 plasma concentrations at the time of attacks reported b y DX -
2930 treated subjects in DX-2930-02 suggests that the 3 planned dosing regimens will provide a 
meaningful range of clinical response while avoiding non- therapeutic or super -therapeutic doses 
and regimens

DX-2930- 04 20 Jan 2017
Study Design:
Study  DX-2930-[ADDRESS_1186153] (IMP), DX -2930, in preventing acute 
angioedema attacks in patients with Ty pe I and Type II HAE. There are two ty pes of subjects 
who will be enrolled into this study :
•Subjects who rollover from Study DX-2930-03 
•Subjects who are non -rollover (ie, were not participant s in Study DX-
2930- 03) 
Rollover Subjects
Rollover subjects are subjects who complete the double- blind treatment period at Day  [ADDRESS_1186154] Study DX-2930-
04 visit for rollover subjects (Day  0) 
will occur on the same day  as the Study DX-2930- 03 Day  182 study  visit. Rollover subjects will 
complete all Study DX
-2930 -03 final study  assessments (Day  182) at which time they  will be 
discharged from that study. No asse ssments conducted between the Study DX-2930- [ADDRESS_1186155] Study DX-2930- 04 visit (Day 0) will be duplicated. Results of the final 
Study DX-2930- [ADDRESS_1186156] 50 subjects ( to approximately 100) who were not participants in Study DX-2930- [ADDRESS_1186157] wait until enrollment for the double -blind study  has ended before they  can screen for Study
DX-2930- 04. The Sponsor may  ease this restriction based on the enrollment rate observed in 
Study DX-2930- 03. Subjects who are still in the run -in period for Study DX-2930-03 w hen 
enrollment for that stud y closes, as well as subjects on prior LTP who screen fail out of Study
DX
-2930- 03 due to an inability  to wash- out of their L TP, may  screen for Study DX-2930-
04 
following discussion with the Sponsor medical monitor.

DX-2930- 04 20 Jan 2017
Screening Period:
Rollover Subjects
There is no screening period for rollover subjects.
Non-rollover Subjects
Non-rollover subjects must provide informed consent and have screening assessments completed 
within [ADDRESS_1186158] open -label dose. Screened non- rollover subjects (adults and 
adolescents) who are on LTP with C1-INH therapy for HAE can continue their current LTP until 
Day 8 (or Day  15) such that subjects will have received 2 (or 4) doses of C1- INH. For subjects 
who are on attenuated androgens (e g, danazol) or anti-fibrinoly tics (eg, tranexamic acid), a 
similar tapering schedule is recommended. However, the taper can be prolonged b y an additional 
week , if medically  indicated, as long as androgen or anti -fibrinol ytic therapy  is stopped within [ADDRESS_1186159] dose of DX-2930.  
Treatment Period:
Rollover Subjects
Following informed consent and pre -dose assessments, rollover subjects will receive a single 
open -label dose of 300 mg DX -2930 administered subcutaneousl y (SC) on Day  0.  Subjects will 
not receive an y additional DX -[ADDRESS_1186160] be 
conducted at the investigative site: pregnancy testing, clinical laboratory  testing, phy sical 
examination, 12- Lead ECG, QoL , PK, PD and anti -drug antibody  sample collection. All other 
scheduled study visits may be conducted via site check -in calls to collect information on adverse 
events, concomitant therapy
, and HAE attack data.  See Study  Activities Schedule for which 
visits must be conducted at the study  site.
Once a r ollover subject reports their first HAE attack they  will present to the investigative site 
for their second open -label dose of DX -[ADDRESS_1186161] and site schedules allow.  If 
the second dose is to be administered within the accepted ±4 day  window around a scheduled 
study  visit, this treatment visit will represent that scheduled visit. If that scheduled visit has 
alread y occurred, the day of the visit will be considered an acceptable, extra study  visit (ie, an 
unscheduled visit).  Similarly , if the second dose is administered outside of the accepted ±4 day  
window around a scheduled visit, the day  of the visit will be considered an acceptable extra 
unscheduled stud y visit, (ie, this visit will not replace an y scheduled visit).
Regardless of the s tudy day, at the visit in which the second open -label dose of DX -[ADDRESS_1186162]’s first HAE attack occurs, there will be a minimum of [ADDRESS_1186163]’s second dose, but will not exceed [ADDRESS_1186164] dose administered at the Day  350 study  visit.
All Subjects:
All doses (with the e xception of the second dose for rollover subjects) require a minimum of 10 
days and maximum of 18 day s between administrations, and should fall within the accepted ±4 
day window around study  visits.
After the second DX -2930 dose is given either within the study  window (±4 day s) or an 
acceptable extra study  visit, the 3rddose must be administered at the next pre -defined study visit 
according to the schedule of assessments.
If a subject experiences an acute angioedema attack at any  time during the study  that in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_852717], standard of care therap y should be 
provided based on subject’s medical history  and per locall y approved product information. 
Administration of DX- [ADDRESS_1186165] receives treatment for a breakthrough angioedema 
attack on the day  of a scheduled dose of study  drug (if self -administering) or scheduled study  
visit.
Self Administration
All subj ects (adolescent or adult) who are considered suitable candidates (ie, those with a 
physical and mental capability  of learning and willing to be trained) may  be allowed to self -
administer treatment. Subjects must complete appropriate training b y the invest igator or designee 
and understanding of the training must be confirmed by  [CONTACT_1719]. Subjects are 
allowed to initiate self- administration at the subject’s home or other agreed upon location after 
receiving the first 2 doses of DX- 2930 at the study  site. Once initiated, subjects may  self-
administer subsequent doses of DX -2930 at the investigational site (when visits are scheduled 
study  site visits) or the subject’s home or other agreed upon location (when the study  permits off -
site dosing) . See Schedule of Activities for details. Adolescent subjects self -administering 
investigational product will be supervised by  a parent/legal guardian/caregiver. Alternatively , a

administer DX -[ADDRESS_1186166] been appropriately documented.
Throughout the stud y, study  site personnel will document information in source documents (ie, 
the subject’s medical record) and eCRF regarding the subject’s experience wi th self-
administration and SC administration of DX -2930.
Follow -up Period
After completion of the treatment period, all subjects will undergo safet y evaluations during a 4-
week follow -up period.
Modifications to Open -Label Dosing
If, at an y time, an important dose -related safety signal is identified either from this study  or 
Study DX-2930- 03, the Sponsor may  decide to switch the enrolled subjects who have not y et 
completed the treatment period, and an y subsequent subjects, to recei ve a different open

the interpretation of study  results).
Test Product; Dose; and Mode of Administration:
DX-2930 is a sterile, preservative -free solution for injection, pH 6.0. The active ingredient, 
DX-2930, is formulated using the following compendial components:  30 mM sodium phosphate 
dibasic dihy drate, 19.6 mM citric acid, 50 mM histidine, 90 mM sodium chloride, 0.01% 
Polysorbate 80. Each open -label vial contains a nominal concentration of [ADDRESS_1186170] will receive a total of 2 mL (2 vials), which will 
be administered in a single 2 mL  SC injection. The injection will be given in the upper arm, thigh 
or abdomen.
Self-Administration Option: Investigational product canbeself-administered without supervision
(parental supervision required foradolescent subjects) after subjects receive appropriate training
by[CONTACT_852834]. Subjects are allowed to 
initiate offsite self-administration after receiving the first 2 doses of DX -2930 at the study  site 
and may  continue to self -administer all subsequent doses (see Study  Activities Schedule).
Duration of Treatment:
All subjects will receive open -label DX -[ADDRESS_1186171] udy visit.
There will be a ±[ADDRESS_1186172]  from 
the investigational site .

DX-2930- 04 20 Jan 2017
Duration of Study for Individual Subjects:
Following informed consent, subjects will either rollover from DX -2930-03 or undergo 
screening assessments (non- rollover subjects). Screening assessments for non -rollover subjects 
must occur within [ADDRESS_1186173] open- label dose. Eligible subjects will be enrolled 
and undergo a 364 day  treatment period. At the conclusion of the treatment period, subjects will 
be followed for an additional 4 weeks. 
Prohibited Concomitant Treatments:
Use of the following treatm ents will not be permitted during the stud y:
•Long -term prophy laxis for HAE (eg, use of C1- INH for LTP, attenuated androgens, or anti-
fibrinoly tics) once LTP is discontinued (within [ADDRESS_1186174] dose of DX -
2930). 
•Angiotensin- converting enzy me (ACE) inhibitors.
•Initiating or changing the dose of estrogen -containing medications with sy stemic absorption 
(such as oral contraceptives or hormonal replacement therapy ) 3 months prior to study  
screening.
•Use of androgens (eg, stanozolol, danazol, oxan drolone, methy ltestosterone, and 
testosterone) for non- HAE related medical conditions or for HAE after discontinuation 
during the first three weeks.
•Any other investigational drug or device.
The use of short -term prophy lactic treatment for HAE will be permitted if medically  indicated.  
Short -term (pre -procedure) proph ylaxis is defined as use of C1 -INH to avoid angioedema 
complications from medically  indicated procedures.
Management of Acute Attacks:
Acute HAE attacks during the stud y are to be managed in accord with the investigator’s usual 
care of their patients, including use of acute attack therapi[INVESTIGATOR_852718]. Use of C1- INH will be permitted as an acute attack therap y but not as a 
long-term prophy lactic the rapy. Administration of DX -[ADDRESS_1186175] has s ymptoms of 
an HAE attack the day  of DX -2930 administration and/or receives treatment for an HAE attack.   
The administration of DX -[ADDRESS_1186176] preference or ph ysician discretion.
Safety Assessments:
Safety  assessments will include the following:

•12-Lead electrocardiogram (ECG)
Adverse events of special interest (AESI) will be captured and monitored during this study . 
Hypersensitivity  reactions and events of disordered coagulation will be considered AESI.
Pharmacokinetic (PK) Assessments:
Blood samples will be collected for the measurement of plasma DX -2930 concentrations.
Pharmac odynamic (PD) Assessments:
Blood samples will be collected to evaluate the pharmacod ynamic effects of DX -2930 through 
biomarker assay s.
Immunogenicity Assessments:
Blood samples will be collected to assay  for the presence of anti- drug antibodies, including 
evaluation of neutralizing antibodies (if an y confirmed positive anti- drug antibodies are 
detected).
C1-INH, C1q and C4 Assessments:
Samples for C1 -INH, C4, and C1q assay s will be obtained at screening for eligibility assessment, 
unless alread y collected as part of protocol DX -2930 -02 or DX -2930-03. 
Quality of Life Assessments:
Quality  of life (QoL) assessments will be conducted using the Angioedema Quality  of Life 
Questionnaire (AE -QoL), EuroQoL 5- Dimensional 5 -Level Measure (EQ -5D-5L), Work 
Productivity  and Activit y Impairment Questionnaire: General Health (WPAI -GH), Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_710196] (HADS), and 12 Item Short Form Survey  (SF-12).
DX-[ADDRESS_1186177]’s experience with self -administration and SC injection will be 
completed b y the subject after all doses of DX -2930.
In addition, assessment survey  of subject experience with SC and self -administration injections 
of DX -[ADDRESS_1186178] as indicated in the Study Activities Schedule.
Collection of HAE Attack Data:
The collection, reporting and assessment of attacks in this study  will be done in accordance with 
the HAE Attack Assessment and Reporting Procedures (HAARP). Study  site personnel will be 
trained on HAARP prior to screening and enrolling subjects at their s ite.
Study  site personnel will train subjects and caregivers on identify ing s ymptoms of an attack, the 
requirements for reporting attacks and the information they  will be expected to provide. The 
subject (and caregiver) will confirm their understanding of what is required of them for reporting 
attacks to the site.
At screening, HAE attack history  will be collected for non- rollover subjects. I nformation 
collected will include any prior history  of lary ngeal attacks, attack frequency , average severit y, 
predomi nant attack location(s ), triggers, average duration, acute attack therapy  use and history  of 
LTP (including duration of L TP, medication(s) and dose used for LTP, and frequency  of attacks 
while receiving LTP). If available, information will also be collecte d on HAE diagnosis (y ear of 
confirmation, how man y years after onset of s ymptoms was diagnosis confirmed, or if subject 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 15
Clinical Trial Protocol Am endment 2

was misdiagnosed).
During the study , subjects (or caregivers) will be instructed to notify  and report details to the 
study  site within [ADDRESS_1186179] in tracking any  HAE attacks experienced, but their use is 
not mandatory .
Subjects (or caregivers) will be asked to provide the following information when reporting an 
attack:
Date and time s ymptoms of an attack were first experienced.
Description of s ymptoms experienced, including location(s).
Impact on activit y (work, school, social interactions) and whether an y assistance or 
medical intervention was required, including hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], additional laboratory  tests 
or emergency  department visits .
Any medi cations used to treat the attack (both prescription and over the counter) .
If the attack resolved, date and time the subject was no longer experiencing sy mptoms.
Study  site personnel will review the information provided and solicit additional information a s 
necessary  to document the attack, as described in HAARP.
Study  site personnel will contact [CONTACT_852737]  [ADDRESS_1186180]- reported and investigator/ phy sician designee -confirmed HAE attacks will 
be recorded in the eCRF. 
Emergency  department visits for HAE attacks and HAE attacks resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_852688].
To be confirmed as an attack, the event must have sy mptoms or signs consistent with an attack in 
at least one of the following locations: 
•Peripheral angioedema: cutaneous swelling involving an extremity , the face, neck, torso, 
and/or genitourinary  region.
•Abdominal angioedema: abdominal pain, with or without abdominal distention, nausea, 
vomiting, or diarrhea.
•Lary ngeal angioedema: stridor, dy spnea, difficult y speaking, difficult y swallowing, throat 
tightening, or swelling of the tongue, palate, uvula, or lary nx.
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_852664] s ymptoms, the investigator or phy sician designee may still 
clinically  determine that the event did not represent an attack if there are features that strongl y 
refute such a diagnosis. For example, the reported event is accompanied b y symptoms that are 
not consistent with an HAE attack (eg, urticaria), the reported event persists well bey ond the 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_852665], or there is a likely  alternate etiology  for the event (eg, the 
subject’ s abdominal s ymptoms are attributable to a viral gastroenteritis outbreak in the 
household). 
To be counted as a unique attack distinct from the previous attack, the new sy mptoms must occur 
at least 24 hours after resolution of the prior attack’s sy mptoms.
Interim Analyses and Data Monitoring
Interim anal yses may  be conducted to support administrative decisions and/or regulatory  
reporting when a reasonable number ofsubjects have completed [ADDRESS_1186181] (DSMB) has been established to provide 
ongoin g, independent review and assessment of the safet y data for Study DX-2930- 03. While an 
independent DSMB is not currentl y planned for this study , summary  safety  data from Study DX-
2930- 04 may  be reviewed by  [CONTACT_852835]-2930-03 DSMB as part of the collectio n of safet y 
information available on DX -
2930. 
Individual Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1869]:
Dosing for an y individual subject will be discontinued if the subject experiences a 
DX-2930- related SAE (or a DX -2930- related, clinically  significant non-serious AE) that, in the 
assessment of the investigator, warrants discontinuation from further dosing for that subject’s 
well-being. The investigator has the ability  to contact [CONTACT_852772]. Subjects will continue to be followed through the completion of all scheduled non -
dosing visits, unless they request to be discontinued from the study .

Sample Size Determination:
No formal sample size calculation was performed.  The sample size is not based on an y 
statistical considerations.  This study  is designed to evaluate the safet y and efficacy  of open- label 
treatment with DX -2930 in subjects who participated in Study  DX-2930- 03 and individuals who 
were not otherwise able to participate in Study  DX-2930-
03.
Statistical Methodology:
Time to the first investigator-confirmed HAE attack will be anal yzed using the Rollover Safet y 
Population.
Time to the first investigator- confirmed HAE attack (day s) will be calculated from the date and 
time of the first open -label dose of DX -[ADDRESS_1186182] investigator -confirmed HAE 
attack, including but not limited to: baseline attack rate prior to entering Study  DX-2930- 03, the 
treatment group in Study  DX-2930- 03, the time since the last dose given in Study  DX-2930-03, 
the time since the last HAE attack, and the rate of attacks during Study  DX
-2930- 03. Results of 
this exploratory  anal ysis will be summarized.  
Number of Investigator -confirmed HAE Attacks
The number of investigator- confirmed HAE attacks during the treatment period (Day  0 through 
Day 364) e xpressed as a monthly  HAE attack rate, will be anal yzed using each analy sis 
population.
The monthly  rate of investigator -confirmed HAE attacks during th e treatment period will be 
calculated for each subject as the number of investigator- confirmed HAE attacks occurring 
during the treatment period divided by  [CONTACT_28991] s the subject contributed to the 
treatment period multiplied by  [ADDRESS_1186183].
Similar summary  tables will be presented for the following efficacy  endpoints for each anal ysis 
population:
•Number of investigator -confirmed HAE attacks requiring acute treatment during the 
treatment period.
•Number of moderate or severe investigator -confirmed HAE attacks during the treatment 
period.
•Number of high- morbidity  investigator -confirmed HAE attacks during the treatment period; 
a high -morbidity  HAE attack is defined as any  attack that has at least one of the following 
characteristics: severe, results in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (except hospi[INVESTIGATOR_28061] < 24 
hours), hemod ynamicall y significant (s ystolic blood pressure < 90, requires IV hy dration, or 
associated with s yncope or near -syncope) or lary ngeal.
Safety Analysis:
Adverse Events
Treatment -emergent AEs are defined as AEs with onset at the time of or following the first 
exposure to open -label DX -2930 in this study , or medical conditions present prior to the start of 
treatment but increasing in severit y or relationship at the time of or following the start of 
treatment. 
The anal yses described in this section will be based on treatment- emergent AEs; plainly  referred 
to as AEs in this section for brevit y.  
Related AEs are AEs classified as related to stud y drug b y the investigator. Severe AEs are AEs 
classified as severe (grade 3) or life threatening (grade 4) b y the investigator.
The number and percentage of subjects with an y AE, any related AE, an y SAE, any related SAE, 
any severe AE, and any  related severe AE as well as the total number of events for each category  
will be summarized.  The number of deaths due to an AE, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_852719] y 
discontinuation due to an AE will be summarized. 
The number and percentage of subjects with an AE, as well as the total num ber of AEs, will be 
summarized by  [CONTACT_2946], and PT. This tabulation will be repeated for related AEs, SAEs, related 
SAEs, severe AEs, and related severe AEs. 
Adverse events of special interest (AESI) for this study  are h ypersensitivity reactions and 
disordere d coagulation (hy percoagulability  events and bleeding events).  Standardized MedDRA 
Queries (SMQ) for each AESI  will be performed using the study  data. The number and percentage 
of subjects with an AESI, as well as the total number of AESIs, will be summar ized by  [CONTACT_3592]. 
Separate summary  tables will be created for each AESI  and for those events with the SMQs 
classified as related, serious, related serious, severe, and related severe.  A listing detailing the 
PT within the SMQ will be provided.

1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 DX-2930
DX-2930 is a full y human IgG1 recombinant monoclonal antibody that binds specificall y to 
active plasma kallikrein. DX -2930 is being developed for proph ylactic treatment of angioedema 
attacks in patients with hereditary  angioedema (HAE), a serious and life -threatening disease.
1.2 Here ditary Angioedema
HAE is a long -term, debilitating, and life- threatening disease caused by  [CONTACT_439081] 
C1-inhibitor (C1- INH) gene, resulting in deficiency  or dy sfunction of C1 -INH protein. HAE 
manifests clinically  as unpredictable, intermittent attacks of subcutaneous or submucosal edema 
of the face, lary nx, gastrointestinal tract, limbs and/or genitalia ( Zuraw, 2008
).Swelling may  last 
up to five or more day s; most patients suffer multiple attacks per y ear. HAE is an orphan 
disorder. The exact prevalence of HAE is unknown, but current estimates range from [ADDRESS_1186206] estimate (By[CONTACT_281998], 2009; Goring et al., 1998 ; Lei et al., 2011 ; Nordenfelt et al., 2014 ; 
[COMPANY_002] et al., 2005). 
Swelling in the lary nx can obstruct the airway s and cause death from asphyxiation (Bork et al., 
2000; Bork et al., 2012) . Approximately  50% of all patients with HAE will experience a 
laryngeal attack in their lifetime, and there is no way  to predict which patients ar e at risk of a 
laryngeal attack (Bork et al., 2003 ; Bork et al., 2006 )
. 
Abdominal attacks are often associated with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea ,and severe pain; 
intestinal sy mptoms resembling abdominal emergencies may  lead to unnecessary  surgery  
(Zuraw, 2008 ). 
Approximately  85% of patients with HAE have Ty pe I HAE, characterized by  [CONTACT_852838] C1 -INH protein, while the remaining approximately  15% of 
patients with HAE have Ty pe II HAE and produce normal or elevated levels of a functionall y 
impaired C1 -INH (Zuraw, 2008) . In patients with Ty pes I and II HAE, uncontrolled plasma 
kallikrein generation results in excess brady kinin release from high -molecular weight kininog en 
(HMWK) and vascular leak mediated b y brad ykinin binding to the B2 receptor (B2 -R) on the 
surface of endothelial cells (Zuraw, 2008
). Clinical suspi [INVESTIGATOR_852667] I and II HAE can be 
confirmed b y available blood tests. In addition to abnormalities in C1- INH level and function, 
plasma C4 levels are often reduced in blood from most patients with HAE .
1.3 Therapeutic Rationale for DX-2930
Plasma kallikrein play s a critical role in the pathogenesis of HAE attacks (Davis, 2006; Kaplan 
and Joseph, 2010). In normal phy siology , C1-INH regulates the activity  of plasma kallikrein as 
well as a variet y of other proteases, such as C1r, C1s, factor XIa, and factor XIIa. Plasma 
kallikrein regulates the release of bradykinin from HMWK. Due to a deficiency of C1 -INH in 
HAE, uncontrolled plasma kallikrein activity occurs and leads to the excessive generation of 
bradykinin. Brad ykinin is a vasodilator which is thought to be responsible for the characteristic 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 37

DX-2930- 04 20 Jan 2017
HAE sy mptoms of localized swelling, inflammation, and pain ( Craig et al., 2012; Zuraw et al., 
2013) . Intervening at the level of bradykinin production with a plasma kallikrein inhibitor 
therefore rep resents an attractive and rational therapeutic strategy  for HAE. I ndeed, the 
importance of plasma kallikrein as a drug target in HAE has been validated through the observed 
effectiveness of Kalbitor®(ecallantide), a peptide that specificall y targets plasm a kallikrein, 
which was approved b y the FDA for the treatment of acute HAE attacks ( Kalbitor®, 2015). 
DX-2930 is a highly  potent and specific inhibitor of plasma kallikrein (K i = 125 pM). X -ray 
crystallograph y of DX- 2930 combined with plasma kallikrein demonstrates DX -2930 binding to 
the active site of kallikrein (Kenniston et al., 2014 )
.
1.[ADDRESS_1186207] -in-human study  with DX -2930 in health y 
subjects ,did not identify  any safet y concerns. Single doses up to 3 mg/kg of DX- 2930 were well -
tolerated. There were no dose -limiting toxicities, serious adverse events, o r any  other safet y 
concerns identified.
Pharmacokinetic (PK) data from the Phase 1a (DX-
2930- 01) and Phase 1b (DX -2930- 02) 
clinical stud ies 
in conjunction with data from the nonclinical toxicity  studies support a wide 
safet y margin. The mean C maxfor human subjects treated at a dose of 300 mg on Day s 1 and 15 
was approximately  27g/mL. As comparison, a mean C maxof 744 g/mL was observed 
following dosing of monkey s with 50 mg/kg DX -2930 subcutaneous (SC) weekl y for 6 months
resulting in a safet ymargin of approximately  28-fold. No toxicologically  significant findings 
were observed in these treated animals or in any  other nonclinical toxicity  study  to date for
systemicall y administered DX -2930.
Safety  data is also available from the Phase 1b study (DX-2930- 02), a multiple -ascending dose 
study  in patients with HAE . In this study , two doses of DX
-2930 up to 400 mg administered 14 
days apart were well -tolerated. There were no dose -limiting toxicities, serious adverse events in 
any DX-2930 treated subj ects, or an y other safet y concerns identified in this study  of patients 
with HAE . Pharmacokinetic data from the 1b study  found that the drug exposure following two 
administrations of DX- 2930 (up to a maximum of 400 mg) was substantially  less than that 
attained and evaluated in the nonclinical toxicity  studies.

1.6 DX-2930 Clinical Data
The clinical development program to date for DX -2930 consists of 2 studies to evaluate the 
safet y, tolerabilit y, and PK of DX -2930, including one completed Phase 1a single -ascending 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 38
Clinical Trial Protocol Am endment 2
DX-2930- 04 20 Jan 2017
dose study  in healthy  subjects and a Phase 1b multiple -ascending dose study  in patients with 
HAE . These studies are summarized in the following sections.
1.6.1 Single -Ascending Dose Study in Healthy Subjects (DX -2930-01)
DX-2930- 01 was a Pha se 1a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study  in health y 
subjects to evaluate the safet y, tolerability, and PK following a single, SC dose of DX -2930. 
Participating subjects were randomized to receive placebo or active stud y drug within one of t he 
following sequential, ascending dose cohorts: 0.1, 0.3, 1.0, or 3.0 mg/kg. For each dosing cohort, 
6 subjects were randomized to receive active drug and 2 subjects to receive placebo. 
A total of 32 subjects enrolled in the study  and were randomized. Th e treatment groups were 
well balanced for demographic characteristics. The actual dose of DX- 2930 administered to 
subjects ranged from 6.2 mg (in the 0.1 mg/kg group) to 300 mg (in the 3.0 mg/kg group) across 
all cohorts.
Based on the safety  anal ysis, a si ngle administration of DX -2930 was well tolerated up to doses 
of 3.0 mg/kg without evidence of dose
-limiting toxicity . There were no deaths, SAEs, or subject 
discontinuations due to adverse events (AEs) during the stud y. Furthermore, there was no 
significa nt imbalance between placebo and DX -2930 for any  particular treatment -emergent 
adverse event (TEAE). The most commonly  reported TEAE was headache, which occurred at a 
rate of 25% for both DX -[ADDRESS_1186208] of DX -2930 in humans. 
For additional detail regarding the single dose, clinical study  in healthy  subjects, please refer to 
the DX- 2930 Investigator’s Brochure .
1.6.2 Multiple -Ascending Dose Study in HAE Patients (DX-2930-02)
DX
-2930- 02 was a Phase 1b randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled, multiple ascending -
dose study  in patients with HAE to evaluate safet y, tolerability , and PK of SC DX -2930. 
Participating subjects were randomized 2:1 to receive either active study  drug or placebo within 
one of the following sequential, ascending dose cohorts: 30, 100, 300, or 400 mg (nominal 6 
subjects per cohort). Each subject received [ADDRESS_1186209] demographics were balanced in terms of age, race, ethnicity  and BMI . There were 
slightly  more females in the DX -2930 group than in the placebo group (66.7% versus 53.8%). 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page [ADDRESS_1186210] (30 mg) with 
injection site pain lasting [ADDRESS_1186211] (400 mg) with worsening 
headache lasting 1 minute and night sweats.
No safet y signals were identified for vital sig ns, phy sical examinations, clinical laboratory  tests, 
or electrocardiograms (ECG). Results suggested DX- [ADDRESS_1186212] -dose samples (3.3%), obtained from 2 out of 23 subjects (8.7%), were 
confirmed to be anti- drug antibod y-positive. No samples were positive for neutralizing activit y.
The pharmacokinetic analy sis for all subjects in the 30, 100, 300 , and 400 mg doses showed drug 
levels in HAE subjects were dose -dependent and exhibited a prolonged half -life of 
approximately  2 weeks, ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_12340] a human monoclonal antibody . Cmaxdrug levels increased with 
increasing dose, as expected. These parameters were consistent with values o btained in health y 
subjects in S tudy DX-2930 -
01.
A Western blot assay  showed pre -dose baseline levels of mean 2-chain HMWK in unactivated 
plasma collected from patients with HAE was approximately  50%. A statistically  significant 
reduction in [ADDRESS_1186213] 2 attacks in the 3 months prior to study entry  
(0.15 attacks/week). Of those subjects treated with 300 or 400 mg DX -2930, 15 of 16 subjects 
met these criteria. Of the placebo treated subjects, 11 of 13 subjects met these criteria. 
The baseline HAE attack rates (attacks/week) were 0.39 attacks per week in the placebo group, 
0.33 att acks per week in the 300 mg group, 0.55 attacks per week in the 400 mg group and 0.49 
attacks per week in the 300 and 400 mg combined group. During the pre -specified, primary  
efficacy  interval of 6 weeks (from day s 8 to 50; corresponding to a period of not able drug 
exposure), the HAE attack rate, adjusted for baseline attack rate, was 0 in the 300 mg group and 
0.045 attacks per week in the 400 mg group, compared to 0.37 attacks per week in the placebo 
group. This resulted in a 100% reduction vs placebo for the 300 mg DX -2930 group ( P< 0.0001) 
and an 88% reduction vs placebo for 400 mg DX-2930 ( P= 0.005). During this primary  efficacy  
interval, 100% of subjects in the 300 mg group ( P= 0.026) and 82% of subjects in the 400 mg 
group ( P= 0.03) were attack- free compared with 27% of subjects in the placebo group.
The data from this study  demonstrated proof of concept of the abilit y of DX- [ADDRESS_1186214] on plasma kallikrein activity  in patient plasma.

1.7 Rationale for Open -Label Extension Study DX-2930-04
The open
-label DX -2930 extension study  will be preceded by  [CONTACT_852742] a pi[INVESTIGATOR_22735], multi-
center, double -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled parallel -arm stud y (Study  DX-2930- 03) 
evaluating the efficacy  of DX -2930 in preventing acute angioedema attac ks in patients with Ty pe 
I or T ype II HAE.  Further information on Study  DX-2930-03 design can be found in 
Appendix 
5.
Subjects who complete the Study  DX-2930-
03 treatment period will be offered the option of 
rolling into the open -label extension study , Study DX-2930-04.  In addition, a limited number of 
individuals with HAE Type I or Ty pe II who were not enrolled in Study  
DX-2930- 03 (up to 
approximately 100) will be also enrolled. 
The rationale for this open -label extension study  is to evaluate the long -term safet y of repeated 
subcutaneous treatment with DX -2930 and the long -term efficacy  of DX -2930 in preventing 
HAE attacks .  For subjec ts rolling over from DX -2930-
03who were randomized to one of the 
active study  arms, the total duration of exposure across both studies will cover 18 months.  For 
rollover subjects randomized to placebo in DX -2930 -03, and for non -
rollover subjects, the total 
duration of exposure will cover 12 months.  Combined, the overall exposure between Study  
DX-2930- 03 and 
Study  DX-2930-04 will provide a sizable dataset to evaluate DX -2930 as a life -
long, chronic treatment for preventing acute attacks of HAE.  
This study  seeks to evaluate the outer bounds of DX-
2930 dosing frequency (possibly  beyond 
2to 4 weeks) by  [CONTACT_852780] a rollover subject ’s first open- label dose 
and t heir first reported HAE attack .  In addition, characteristics of all HAE attack s will be 
reported and compared to the subject’s historical baseline (for non
-rollover subjects) or attack
history  based on attacks reported in Study  DX-2930 -
03 (for rollover subjects ).
For non -rollover subjects, t he study  will evaluate the safet y and efficacy  of switching from a 
long-term prevention therapy  (eg, C1-INH, anti-fibrinoly tics, androgens) to DX -
[ADDRESS_1186215] health -related quality  of life (QoL), subject experience with self -
administration, and ease of SC administration with DX
-2930.

2. STUDY OBJECTIVES
2.1 Primary Objective
To evaluate the long -term safet y of repeated subcutaneous (SC) administrations of DX -2930
2.2 Secondary Objectives
•To evaluate the long -term efficacy  of DX -2930 in preventing HAE attacks
•To characterize the outer bounds of dosing frequency  for DX -2930
2.3 Tertiary Objectives
•To assess the immunogenicity  of chronicall y administered DX -2930
•To evaluate the effect of DX -2930 on health -related quality  of life (Q oL)
•To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacod ynamic (PD) profile of SC 
administration of DX -2930
•To evaluate safet y and efficacy  in the non
-rollover population of switching from long -term 
prophy lactic (LTP) treatment to DX -2930 
•To evaluate breakthrough attack characteristics while receiving DX -2930 compared to 
historical baseline
•To evaluate subject experience with self -administration of DX -[ADDRESS_1186216] ( IMP)
, DX-2930, in preventing acute 
angioedema attacks in patients with Ty pe I and Type II HAE. There are two ty pes of subjects 
who will be enrolled into this study :
•Subjects who rollover from 
Study  DX-2930-03 
•Subjects who are non -rollover (ie, were not participants in Study  DX-2930- 03) 
Rollover S ubjects
Rollover subjects are subjects who complete the double- blind treatment period at Day  [ADDRESS_1186217] 
Study DX -2930-
04visit for rollover subjects (Day  0) 
will occur on the same day  as Study DX-2930- 03 Day  182 study  visit. Rollover subjects will 
complete all Study  DX-2930 -
03 final study  assessments (Day  182) at which time they  will be 
discharge d from that study . No assessments conducted between Study DX-
2930- [ADDRESS_1186218] Study  DX-2930- 04 visit (Day 0) will be duplicated.  Results of the final 
DX
-2930- [ADDRESS_1186219] 50 subjects ( to approximately 100) who were not participants in Study  DX-2930-[ADDRESS_1186220] wait until e nrollment for the double -blind study  has ended before they  can screen for Study  
DX-2930- 04. The Sponsor may  ease this restriction based on the enrollment rate observed in 
Study  DX
-2930-03. Subjects who are still in the run -in period for Study DX-2930- 03 when 
enrollment for that stud y closes, as well as subjects on prior LTP who screen fail out of Study
DX-2930- 03 due to aninability  to wash-out of their L TP, may  screen for Study  DX-
2930-04 
following discussion with the Sponsor medical monitor.

Screening Per iod:
Rollover subjects
There is no screening period for rollover subjects.
Non-rollover subjects
Non-rollover subjects must provide informed consent and have screening assessments completed 
within [ADDRESS_1186221] open -label dose.  Screened no n-rollover subjects (adults and 
adolescents) who are on LTP with C1 -INH therapy  for HAE can continue their current LTP until 
Day 8 (or Day  15) such that subjects will have received 2 (or 4) doses of C1- INH.  For subjects 
who are on attenuated androgens (eg, danazol) or anti -fibrinoly tics (eg, tranexamic acid) ;a 
similar ta pering schedule is recommended. However, the taper can be prolonged b y an additional 
week ,if medically  indicated ,aslong as androgen or anti -fibrinol ytic therapy  is stopped within [ADDRESS_1186222] dose of DX -2930.  
Treatment Period:
Rollover Subjects
Following informed consent and pre -dose assessments, rollover subjects will receive a single 
open -label dose of DX-2930 administered subcutaneously  (SC)on Day  0. Subjects w ill not 
receive an y additional DX-[ADDRESS_1186223] be 
conducted at the investigative site: pregnancy testing, clinical laboratory  testing, phy sical 
examination, 12- Lead ECG, Q oL, PK, P D and anti -drug antibody  sample collection.  All other 
scheduled study visits may be conducted via sit e check
-in calls to collect information on adverse 
events, concomitant therapy , and HAE attack data .  See Study  Activities Schedule for which 
visits must be conducted at the study site .
Once a rollover 
subject reports their first HAE attack they  will present to the investigative site 
for their second open -label dose of DX -[ADDRESS_1186224] and site schedules allow.  If 
the second dose is to be admi nistered within the accepted ± 4 day  window around a scheduled 
study  visit, this treatment visit will represent that scheduled visit .If that scheduled visit has 
alread y occurred ,the day of the visit will be considered an acceptable, extra study  visit .  
In the event 
that the second dose is to be administered outside of the accepted ±4 day  window 
around a scheduled visit, the day  of the visit will be considered an acceptable extra study  visit 
(ie, this visit will not replace an y scheduled visit). 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page [ADDRESS_1186225]’s first HAE attack occurs, there will be a minimum of [ADDRESS_1186226]’s second dose, but will not exceed [ADDRESS_1186227] dose administered at the Day  350 study  visit.
All Subjects:
All doses (with the exception of the second dose for rollover subjects) require a minimum of 1 0 
days and maximum of 18 days between administrations, a nd should fall within the accepted ± 4 
day window around study  visits. 
After the second DX -2930 dose is given either within the study  window (±4 day s) or an 
acceptable extra study  visit, the 3rddose must be administered at the next pre -defined study  visit 
according to the schedule of assessments.
If a subject experiences an acute angioedema attack at any  time during the study  that in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_852717], standard of care therap y should be 
provided based on subject ’s medical history  and per locall y approved product information. 
Administration of DX- [ADDRESS_1186228] receives treatment for a breakthrough angioedema 
attack on the day  of a scheduled dose of study  drug (if self -administering) or scheduled study  
visit.
Self-Administration
All subjects (adolescent or adult) who are considered suitable candidates (ie, those with a 
physical and mental capability  of learning and willing to be trained) may  be allowed to self -
administer treatment . Subjects must complete appropriate training b y the investigator or designee 
and have their understanding of the procedures confirmed b y the investigator or designee. 
Subjects are allow ed to initiate self- administration at the subject’s home or other agreed upon 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page [ADDRESS_1186229] 2 doses of DX-2930 at the study  site. Once initiated, subjects 
may self-administer subsequent doses of DX -2930 at the investigational site (whe n visits are 
scheduled stud y site visits) or the subject’s home or other agreed upon location ( when the study  
permits off -site dosing ).See theSchedule of Activities for details. Adolescent subjects self-
administering DX-2930 will be supervised b y a paren t/legal guardian/caregiver. Alternativel y, a 
parent/legal guardian/caregiver ,after completing appropriate training ,will be allowed to 
administer the investigational product to an adolescent without study site personnel supervision.
Site personnel will ca ll subjects within approximately  [ADDRESS_1186230] been appropriatel y documented .  Throughout the study , study  site 
personnel will document information in source documents (ie, the subject’s medical record) and 
eCRF regarding the subject’s experience with self-administration and SC administration of DX -
2930.
Follow -up Period
After comple tion of the treatment period, all subjects will undergo safet y evaluations during a 4-
week follow -up period. Figure 1shows a schematic of the open- label extension study .

dose and/or frequency .
In addition, b ased on the results of Study  DX-2930 -03, the Sponsor may  switch to a different 
dose and/or frequency .
3.1.2 Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1869]
[IP_ADDRESS] Study Level Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_852668], including SAEs and AESI, will be monitored regularl y throughout the duration of 
the study . If any  potential safet y signal is identified as a result of monitoring in this study, or 
from an y safet y findings from Study  DX-2930-03, or following DS MB review, the Sponsor may  
take actions as deemed appropriate, including suspending dosing in the study , while the potential 
risk is evaluated and a course of action has been determined.
[IP_ADDRESS] Individual Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_852669] y individual subject will be d iscontinued if the subject experiences a 
DX-
2930- related SAE (or DX
-2930- related, clinically  significant non -serious AE) that, in the 
assessment of the investigator or DSMB recommendation , warrants discontinuation from further 
dosing for that subject’s well- being. 
The investigator has the ability  to contact [CONTACT_852783]. Subjects will continue to be followed through the 
completion of all scheduled non- dosing visits, unless they  request to be discontinued from the 
study .
3.1.3 Follow -up for Subjects Meeting Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_852722] (AE, 
laboratory , phy sical examination, vital sign, or ECG finding) will be carefully monitored until 
resolution, which may  include the following:
•Additional clinical laboratory  tests and/or other clinical investigations
•Additional visits or extended duration of follow -up
•Obtaining a specialist consultatio n
3.2 Rationale for Open -Label Extension Dose Selection
The dose selected for the open- label extension (300 mg every  2 weeks) is anticipated to be 
effective and safe as determined in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_22735], double
-blind DX -2930-
03study . If at an y time an 
important dose -related safety  signal is identified either from this study  or Study  DX-2930-03, the 
Sponsor may  decide to switch the enrolled subjects who have not y et completed the treatment 
period, and an y subsequent subjects, to receive a different open -label DX-2930 dose and/or 
frequency .
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 47
Clinical Trial Protocol Am endment 2
DX-2930- 04 20 Jan 2017
Additionally , based on the efficacy results of Study  DX-2930-03, the Sponsor may switch to a 
different dose and/or frequency .
3.[ADDRESS_1186232] dose administered on Day  0 and the final dose administered at the Day  350 
study  visit.
There will be a ± 4day window around each study visit. There will be a minimum of [ADDRESS_1186233] -dose.
All subjects (adolescent or adult) who are considered suitable candidates (ie, those with a 
physical and mental capability  of learning and willing to be trained) may  be allowed to self -
administer treatment after completing appropriate training by  [CONTACT_852839]. Subjects are allowed to initiate self-administration at the 
subject’s 
home or other agreed upon location after receiving the first [ADDRESS_1186234] will be provided the 
necessary supplies (see Section 5.7 and Section 6.15.1 ).
3.4 Study Duration for Individual Subjects
Following informed consent, subjects will either rollover from Study  DX-2930 -03 or undergo 
screening assessments (non- rollover subjects). Screening assessments for non -rollover subjects 
must occur within [ADDRESS_1186235] 50 (to 
approximately 100) additional subjects who were not enrolled in Study  DX-2930-03.  The total
enrollment is 
expected to be at least 150, but not more than [ADDRESS_1186236]  angioedema has been reported in patients with HAE as young as the 
age of 3 (Bork et al., 2003 ). In one case series of [ADDRESS_1186237]  angi oedema by  [CONTACT_14898] 18 (Farkas, 2010) . An important unmet 
medical need exists among children with HAE, especiall y adolescents, since the disease 
commonly  worsens after puberty  (Bennett and Craig, 2015 ; Zuraw, 2008) .  The study  will aim to 
enroll at least [ADDRESS_1186238] meet the following criteria to be enrolled in this study :
1.Male and female HAE subjects who are 12 years of age or older at the time of screening. 
2.Documented diagnosis of disease HAE (Ty pe I or II) based on all of the following:
Documented clinical history  consiste nt with HAE (subcutaneous or mucosal, 
nonpruritic swelling epi[INVESTIGATOR_852659]).
Diagnostic testing results obtained during screening (or a prior DX
-2930 study ) that 
confirm HAE T ype I or II: C1 inhibitor (C1 -INH) functional level < 40% of the 
normal level. Subjects with functional C1 -INH level 40- 50% of the normal level may  
be enrolled if they  also have a C4 level below the normal range.  Subjects may  be 
retested if results are incongruent with clinical history  or believed by  [CONTACT_941] i nvest igator 
to be confounded b y LTP use.

For detailed information regarding open- label DX-2930 (lanadelumab) administration, refer to 
the Pharmacy  Manual.
DX-2930 is a sterile, preservative -free solution for injection, pH 6.0. The active ingredient, 
DX-2930, is formulated using the following compendial components:  30 mM sodium phosphate
dibasic dihy drate , 19.6 mM citric acid, 50 mM histidine, 90 mM s
odium chloride, 0.01% 
Polysorbate 80. Each open -label vial contains a nominal concentration of [ADDRESS_1186241] will receive a total of 2 mL (2 vials) , which will 
be administered in a single 2 mL  SC injection. The injection will be given in the upper arm, thigh 
or abdomen.
Self-Administration
All subjects (adolescent or adult) who are considered suitable candidates (ie, those with a 
physical and mental capability  of le arning and willing to be trained) may  be allowed to 
self-administer treatment after completing appropriate training b y the investigator or designee 
and demonstrating the comprehension to self- administer. Subjects are allowed to initiate self-
administration at the subject’s home or other agreed upon location after receiving the first 2 
doses of DX -2930 at the study  site. Once initiated, subjects may  continue to self -administer 
subsequent doses of DX -2930 at the investigational site (when visits are scheduled study  site 
visits) or the subject’s home or other agreed upon location (when the stud y permits off -site 
dosing). See Schedule of Activities for details. Adolescent subjects self -administering 
investigational product will be supervised by  a parent/legal gu ardian/caregiver. Alternatively , a 
parent/legal guardian/caregiver ,after completing appropriate training ,will be allowed to 
administer DX -[ADDRESS_1186242]’s medical 
record and e CRF regarding the subject’s experience with self-administration and SC 
administration of DX -2930.

of DX
-2930 may be administered at an unscheduled visit if it is outside of the accepted ±[ADDRESS_1186244]’s first HAE attack occurs, there will be a minimum of 
10days between their first open- label dose and their second open -label dose. Following their 
second dose, rollover subjects will continue to receive repeated SC administrations of open -label 
300mg DX -[ADDRESS_1186245]’s second dose, but will not exceed [ADDRESS_1186246] from that study and will continue to be collected through the final study  
visit. 
All information on prior and 
concomitant therap y (including all prescription/non -prescription 
medications, herb al medications and vitamin supplements) must be recorded on the subject’s 
eCRF and should include the name [CONTACT_852903] (start 
and stop dates). Concomitant treatments (non- pharmacological treatments) include any  surgical 
or diagnostic procedures.

[IP_ADDRESS] Management of HAE Attacks
Acute HAE attacks during the stud y are to be managed in accord with the investigator’s usual 
care of their patients, including use of acute attack therap ies that the investigator deems as 
medically  appropriate. Use of C1- INH will be permitted as an acute attack therap y but not as a 
LTP therapy . Administration of DX -[ADDRESS_1186247] has s ymptoms of an HAE attack the 
day of DX -2930 administration and/or receives treatment for an HAE attack . The administration 
of DX -2930 can also be re -scheduled as long as the minimum and maximum timeframe between 
doses are met based on patient preference or phy sician discretion.
5.4.2 Excluded Concomitant Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_852674] y:
•Long -term prophy laxis for HAE (eg, use of C1- INH for LTP, attenuated androgens, or

6.3 Demographics and Medical History
Demographics: date of birth (alternately  age or year of birth, if full date is not allowed to be 
collected for legal reasons), sex, race ,and ethnicity  (where locall y permitted) and medical 
history  will be obtained at Screening from subjects not rolling over from Study  DX-2930-
03and 
will be recorded on the source document and eCRF. Medical history  will capture the subject’s 
current medical status (current disease proces ses), past medical status (past disease processes), 
history  of surgery , allergies and concomitant medications. For subjects rolling over from Study  
DX-2930-
03, these data will be carried forward from that study . 
6.4 HAE Attack Information Collection
The colle ction, reporting and assessment of attacks in this study  will be done in accordance with 
the HAE Attack Assessment and Reporting Procedures (HAARP).  S tudy site personnel will be 
trained on HAARP prior to screening and enrolling subjects at their site.
Study site personnel will train subjects and caregivers on identifying s ymptoms of an attack, the 
requirements for reporting attacks and the information they  will be expected to provide.  The 
subject (and caregiver ) will confirm their understanding of what is required of them for reporting 
attacks to the site.
At screening, HAE attack history  will be collected for non
-rollover subjects. I nformation 
collected will include any prior history  of lary ngeal attacks, attack frequency , average severit y, 
predominant attack location(s ), triggers, average duration, acute attack therapy  use and history  of 
LTP (including duration of L TP, medication(s) and dose used for LTP, and frequency  of attacks 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 57
Clinical Trial Protocol Am endment 2
DX-2930- 04 20 Jan 2017
while receiving LTP).  If available, information will also be collected on HAE diagnosis (y ear of 
confirmation, how man y years after onset of s ymptoms was diagnosis confirmed, or if subject 
was misdiagnosed).
During the study , subjects (or caregivers) will be instructed to notify  and report details to the 
study  site within [ADDRESS_1186258] in tracking any  HAE attacks experienced, but their use is 
not mandatory .
Subjects (or caregivers) will be asked to provide the following information when reporting an 
attack:
•Date and time s ymptoms of an attack were first experienced
•Description of s ymptoms experienced, including location(s)
•Impact on activit y (work, school, social interactions) and whether an y assista nce or medical 
intervention was required, including hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]
, additional laboratory  tests, or 
emergency  department visits
•Any medications used to treat the attack (both prescription and over the counter)
•If the attack resolved, date and time the su bject was no longer experiencing sy mptoms
Study sitepersonnel will review the information provided and solicit additional information as 
necessary  to document the attack, as described in HAARP.
Study site personnel will contact [CONTACT_852840]  7days following the first 
dose of open- label until the subject has received their second open label dose.  This is to insure 
accurate reporting for any  HAE attacks not already  reported by [CONTACT_852841] [ADDRESS_1186259]- reported and investigator / phy sician designee -confirmed HAE attacks will 
be recorded in the eCRF. 
Emergency  department visits for HAE attacks and HAE attacks resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_852688].
To be confirmed as an attack, the event must have sy mptoms or signs consistent with an attack in 
at least one of the following locations: 
•Peripheral angioedema: cutaneous swelling involving an extremity , the face, neck, torso, 
and/or genitourinary  region
•Abdominal angioedema: abdominal pain, with or without abdominal distention, nausea, 
vomiting, or diarrhea
•Lary ngeal a ngioedema: stridor, dy spnea, difficult y speaking, difficult y swallowing, throat 
tightening, or swelling of the tongue, palate, uvula, or lary nx
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_852664] s ymptoms, the investigator or ph ysician designee may  still 
clinically  determine t hat the event did not represent an attack if there are features that strongl y 
refute such a diagnosis. For example, the reported event is accompanied b y symptoms that are 
not consistent with an HAE attack (eg, urticaria), the reported event persists well b eyond the 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_852665], or there is a likely  alternate etiology  for the event (eg, the 
subject’s abdominal s ymptoms are attributable to a viral gastroenteritis outbreak in the 
household). 
To be counted as a unique attack distinct f rom the previous attack, the new sy mptoms must occur 
at least 24 hours after resolution of the prior attack’s sy mptoms.

Activities Schedule (Table 1). For subjects who rollover from Study  DX-2930 -
03, quality  of life 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 63
Clinical Trial Protocol Am endment 2
DX-2930- 04 20 Jan 2017
assessments obtained during the final stud y visit in Study  DX-2930- 03 will serve as the Day  0 
pre-dose quality  of life assessments in this study  and will not be duplicated.
6.14.1 Angioedema Quality of Life Questionnaire (AE- QoL)
The AE- QoL is a self -administered, symptom -specific tool developed and validated to assess 
quality  of life (QoL) impair
ment in patients with recurrent angioedema ( Weller et al., 2012 ). The 
AE-
QoL consists of 17 questions covering four domains/dimensions (functioning, fatigue/mood, 
fear/shame, nutrition). Each of the 17 items has a five -point L ikert-type response scale ranging 
from 1 (Never) to 5 (Very Often). The AE -QoL is scored to produce a score for each domain and 
a total score ranging from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating stronger impairment. I t takes 5 
minutes to complete the AE -QoL.
6.14.2 EuroQoL 5 -Dime nsional 5 -Level Measure (EQ-5D-5L)
The EQ -5D- 5L is a self -administered standardized measure of health status comprised of a 
descriptive s ystem and a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). The descriptive s ystem con sists of five 
health related quality  of life dimensions (ie, mobility , self -care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, 
and anxiety /depression). Each dimension is rated on a 5 -point response scale (5 levels) indicating 
severit y of problems, where 1 is “no problems” and 5 is “extreme problems”. The EQ -5D VAS is 
a measure of overall self -rated health status on a 20 -cm vertical VAS with endpoints labelled 
“the best health you can imagine” and “the worst health y ou can imagine”. The VAS ranges from 
0 to 100, with higher scores indicative of better overall health.
6.14.3 Work Productivity and Activity Impairment – General Health (WPAI- GH)
Questionnaire
The WPAI -GH is a 6- item instrument assessing work and activity  impairment due to health 
problems during the past 7 day s. The instrument elicits four main scores in relation to general 
health specifically : absenteeism (the percentage of work time missed because of one's health in

6.14.4 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5620] (HADS)
The Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_74017] (HADS) is a self-assessment scale to detect states of 
depression, anxiety ,and emotional distress amongst patients who were being treated for a variet y 
of clinical problems ( Zigmond and Snaith, 1983). The scale has a total of 14 items. Seven of the 
items relate to anxiety  and seven relate to depression.  The responses are scored on a scale of 0 –3 
(3 indicates higher s ymptom frequencies). Scores for each subscale (anxiety and depression) 
range from 0 to 21 with scores categorized as follows: normal 0–7, mild 8 –10, moderate 11 –14, 
and severe 15–21. Scores for the entire scale (emotional distress) range from [ADDRESS_1186265]

6.14.5 12 Item Short Form v2 Health Survey (SF -12v2)
The SF -12v2 Health Survey  is a reliable and valid generic measure of functional health and well -
being. The SF -12v2 consists of 12 questions, all selected from the SF -36 Health Survey  (Ware et 
al., 1996 ). The SF -12v2 y ields eight health domains (vitality , phy sical f unctioning, bodily  pain, 
general health perceptions, phy sical role functioning, emotional role functioning, and mental 
health summary  measures. Phy sical and Mental Health Composite Scores (PCS & MCS) can be 
computed using the scores of twelve questions and range from [ADDRESS_1186266] to self- administer DX -2930 on the 
following :
•Transportation and recommended storage conditions of investigational product from the 
study  site to the offsite location.
•Maintenance of accurate records regarding each administration of investigational product 
including supply  identification (ie, lot/kit number), date and time of injection, injection site 
location, infusion time, and if applicable, any reason the self-admini stration could not be 
completed as instructed.
•Retention of all used and unused vials of investigational product for drug accountability  
purposes.
After receiving appropriate training and demonstrating their understanding of self -
administration, subjects are allowed to self -administer DX -[ADDRESS_1186267] 2 doses 
of DX -2930 at the study  site (administered by  [CONTACT_24355]). For those subjects who choose to 
self-administer or have a parent/legal guardian/caregiver administer DX- 2930, subjects must 
complete an assessment of their experience with self- administration and subcutaneous injection
for each dose received . Study  personnel will document the subject’s responses in the subjects’ 
medical record and eCRF.

6.16.1 Definitions
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event
An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a clinical trial subject whether or not it appears to 
have a causal relationship with the treatment administered. 
An AE can therefore be any  unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory  
finding), s ymptom, or disease temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal product or 
participation in a clinical study , whether or not directly  related to the medicinal product or study  
participa tion.
•AEs may be new events or may  be pre -existing conditions that have become aggravated or 
have worsened in severity or frequency  during the course of the stud y.
•AEs may  be clinicall y significant changes from baseline in physical examination, laboratory  
tests, or other diagnostic investigation (eg, laboratory  results, x -ray findings).
Laboratory  abnormalities generall y are not considered AEs unless they are associated with 
clinical signs or s ymptoms, or require medical intervention. A clinicall y significa nt laboratory  
abnormality  that is independent from a known underly ing medical condition and that requires 
medical or surgical intervention, or leads to DX-[ADDRESS_1186270] or are part 
of a known underly ing medical condition are not, in themselves, AEs; rather, the underl ying 
medical condition leading to the abnormalities would be reported as the AE.
Pregnancy  is not an AE; however, if a fema le subject becomes pregnant during the conduct of 
the study , the i nvestigator must notify  the Sponsor according to the procedures provided in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS].
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious Adverse Event
A SAE is any  adverse experience occurring at any dose that results in any  
of the following 
outcomes:
•Death
•Life-threatening experience; Note: “Life -threatening” refers to a situation in which the 
subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that might 
have caused death if it were more seve re.
•Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]; Note: Does not 
include hospi[INVESTIGATOR_852676] 24 hours. A scheduled 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 66
Clinical Trial Protocol Am endment 2
DX-2930- 04 20 Jan 2017
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a pre- existing condition that has not worsened during p articipation in the 
study  does not meet this criterion. Pre -planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_852677]/surgical procedure or routine check -ups do not meet this criterion.
•Results in persistent or significant disability  or incapacit y.
•Is a congenital anomal y or birth defect.
•Is considered to be an important medical event defined as those that may  not be immediately  
life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may  jeopardize the subject or may  
require intervention to prevent one of the ou tcomes listed in the definition above.
[IP_ADDRESS] Overdose
An overdose is defined as a significant variation from the recommended/scheduled dosage for a 
product. The dosing for this study  will be conducted in a controlled clinical setting and an 
overdose is not anti cipated. However, in the event of an accident, for this study , an overdose of 
DX-[ADDRESS_1186271].
[IP_ADDRESS] Planned Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]
A hospi[INVESTIGATOR_852678]- label DX-[ADDRESS_1186272]’s medical history  isconsidered complete. However, if the event/condition worsens 
during the trial, it must be reported as an AE.
[IP_ADDRESS] Treatment -Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE)
An AE is treatment -emergent if the onset time is after first administration of open- label DX-
[ADDRESS_1186273]’s participation in Study  
DX-2930-[ADDRESS_1186274] open
-label dose in Study  DX-
2930-04
, and then subseque ntly reappeared in Study  DX-2930-04 will be counted as a new 
TEAE in 
Study  DX-2930-04 .
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI)
Adverse events of special interest (AESI) will be captured and monitored during this study . 
Investigators will report all AESI  to the Sponsor , regardless of causality , using the same 
timelines as described for SAE reporting. The following describe the AESI and the criteria for 
reporting AESI. 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page [ADDRESS_1186275] ed to be related to study drug.
EVENTS OF DISORDERED COAGULATION
Bleeding AESI
Although aPTT prolongation due to plasma kallikrein inhibition is an artifactual in vitro
phenomenon, as a precautionary  measure in evaluating the safet y of DX-2930 , bleeding events 
will be reported as AESI for this study . Investigators will report all diagnoses, or signs and 
symptoms when diagnoses cannot be determined, that are consistent with a clinical event of 
bleeding. Coagulation testing (aPTT, PT, INR) should be performed when possible, and when 
temporally  reasonable, with any  reports of bleeding or for clinical conditions possibly  indicative 
of bleeding.
Hypercoagulable AESI
Investigators will report all diagnoses, or signs and sy mptoms when diagnoses cannot be 
determined, that are consistent wit h a thrombotic or embolic etiology . 
6.16.2 Monitoring
[IP_ADDRESS] Monitoring of Adverse Events
Each subject will be monitored for the occurrence of AEs, including SAEs and AESI, from 
signing of the ICF through the final follow- up visit.
•Subjects will be questioned and/or ex amined b y the investigator or a qualified designee for 
evidence of AEs. The questioning of subjects with regard to the possible occurrence of AEs 
will be generalized such as, "How have you been feeling since your last visit?”  The presence 
or absence of sp ecific AEs should not be elicited from subjects.
•Subjects having TEAEs will be monitored until resolution with relevant clinical assessments 
and laboratory  tests, as determined by  [CONTACT_941] i nvestigator.
•AEs, actions taken as a result of AEs, and follow -up resul ts must be recorded in the eCRF as 
well as in the subject's source documentation. Follow -up laboratory  results should be filed 
with the subject's source documentation.
For an y SAEs or AEs that require the subject to be discontinued from dosing, relevant c linical 
assessments and laboratory  tests will be repeated as clinically  appropriate, until final resolution 
or stabilization of the event(s). Subjects will continue to be followed through completion of all 
scheduled visits.

DX-2930- 04 20 Jan 2017
[IP_ADDRESS] Monitoring of Safety Laboratory Assessments
All safet y laboratory  assessments will be performed at a central laboratory . The clinical 
laboratory  values will be reported to the investigator who will review them for clinical 
significance and consideration of abnormal values as potential AE s.
6.16.3 Assessment of Adverse Events
[IP_ADDRESS] Assessment of Severity
The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity  (severit y) of a specific event (as in mild, 
moderate, or severe m yocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may  be of relatively  minor 
medical significance (such as severe nausea). This is not the same as “serious,” which is based 
on subject/event outcome or action criteria usuall y associated with events that pose a threat to a 
subject’s life or functioning.
In this stud y, the severity of AEs will be assessed according to Division of Microbiology  and 
Infectious Diseases (DMID) Adult Toxicity  Table, Draft, November 2007 (US National 
Institutes of Health: National I nstitute of Allergy  and Infectious Diseases) ( Appendix 1 , 
Appendix 2 ) and the Division of Microbiology  and I nfectious Diseases (DMID) Pediatric 
Toxicity  Table, Draft, November 2007 (US National I nstitutes of Health: National Institute of 
Allergy  and Infectious Diseases) ( Appendix 3 ). For abnormalities not specifically  found in the 
Toxicity  Tables, the following general scale will be used to estimate grade of severit y:
•GRADE 1 (Mild): Transient or mild discomfort; no medical intervention/therap y required
•GRADE 2 (Moderate): Mild to moderate limitation in activity  -some assistance may  be 
needed; no or minimal medical intervention/therapy  required
•GRADE 3 (Severe): Marked limitation in activity , some assistance usuall y required; medical 
intervention/therap y requ ired, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29125] 
•GRADE 4 (Life -threatening): Extreme limitation in activity , significant assistance required; 
significant medical intervention/therap y required, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_852724] -emergent ECG abnormalit y that is considered b y the investigator as clinicall y 
significant and requiring intervention/therap y will be assessed as a severe AE.
All HAE attacks will be captured as AEs and assessed with DMID & HAE Attack Assessment 
and Reporting Procedures (HAARP) criteria.
[IP_ADDRESS] Assessment of Causality
A medicall y qualified investigator must assess the relationship of an y AE (including SAEs) to 
the use of DX-
2930, as related or not related, based on clinical judgment and using all available 
information, and may include c onsideration of the following factors:
•Possible alternative causes of the AE, including the disease under treatment, pre -existing 
conditions, concomitant use of other drugs, and presence of environmental or genetic factors.
•The temporal association between DX-2930 exposure and onset of the AE.
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 69
Clinical Trial Protocol Am endment 2
DX-2930- 04 20 Jan 2017
•Whether the manifestations of the AE are consistent with known actions or toxicity  of 
DX-2930.
•The AE resolved or improved with decreasing the dose or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_852681]-2930
(dechallenge). Judgment should be used if multiple products are discontinued at the same 
time.
The causal relationship between DX-2930 and the AE will be assessed using one of the 
following categories:
Not Related:   Factors consistent with an assessment of Not Related include:
Temporal relationsh ip is lacking (eg, the event did not occur within a reasonable 
time frame following administration of 
DX-2930); or
Other causative factors more likely  explain the event (eg, a pre -existing condition, 
other concomitant treatments).
Related:   Factors consist ent with an assessment of Related include:
There is a positive temporal relationship (eg, the event occurred within a 
reasonable time frame following administration of DX-2930); or
The AE is more likel y explained by [CONTACT_852747]-2930 than b y another 
cause (ie, the AE shows a pattern consistent with previous knowledge of 
DX-
2930 or the class of DX-2930).
[IP_ADDRESS] Assessment of Clinical Significance
Clinical significance of individual AEs will be determined b y the investigator, with discussion 
with the Medical Monitor as appropriate.
6.16.4 Clinical Laboratory Adverse Events
Laboratory  abnormalities generall y are not considered AEs unless they are associated with 
clinical signs or s ymptoms, or require medical intervention. A clinicall y significant labor atory  
abnormality  that is independent from a known underly ing medical condition and that requires 
medical or surgical intervention, or leads to DX-2930 interruption or discontinuation, will be 
considered an AE.
When laboratory  abnormalities are considered to be AEs, the DMID Adult Toxicity  Table 
(Appendix 2 ) or DMID Pediatric Toxicity Tables ( Appendix 3 ) will be used to assess severit y. 
Where discrepancies in the upper limit of normal (ULN) and lower limit of normal (LLN) of 
laboratory  ranges occur between those included in the DMID tables and those of the laboratory  
that performs the assay s, the values provided by  [CONTACT_852845] y grade. Clinical significance of individual laboratory  AEs wil l be determined by  [CONTACT_852793]. 
Following is an exception to defining clinically  significant, abnormal laboratory values as AEs:
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 70
Clinical Trial Protocol Am endment 2
DX-2930- 04 20 Jan 2017
APTT prolongation in the absence of an y associated bleeding or other eviden ce of clinical 
relevance will not be considered a clinically  significant laboratory  abnormality  or AE. In the 
appropriate ph ysiologic setting, such as IV heparin therapy , aPTT can be used to monitor 
bleeding risk. However, as noted in the Investigators Brochure, aPTT prolongation due to 
plasma kallikrein inhibition is an artifactual in vitro phenomenon. Although plasma kallikrein 
drives fibrin formation in the aPTT assay , plasma kallikrein -driven coagulation does not 
appear to have hemostatic or other ph ysiologically  important functions in vivo . It is well 
documented that, in humans, deficiency  of factor XII or prekallikrein (and thus plasma 
kallikrein) is not associated with abnormal bleeding, either spontaneous or during surgical 
procedures ( Renne and Gruber, 2012 ). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_852682], defi ciency  of either 
protein is associated with marked prolongation of the aPTT. 
6.16.5 Reporting Investigator Safety Observations to the Sponsor
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting Non -serious Adverse Events
All AEs, regardless of seriousness, severit y, or causal relationship to DX-[ADDRESS_1186276], regardless of 
whether or not they  are confirmed by  [CONTACT_093], will be captured as AEs.
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting Pregnancies
If a female subject or the female part ner of a male subject becomes pregnant during the course of 
the study , the 
investigator must report the pregnancy  to the Sponsor’s Pharmacovigilance 
Department using the Pregnancy  Reporting Form within 24hours of becoming aware of the 
event. The i nvestiga tor must obtain consent to collect pregnancy  information (including the 
status of the newborn, if applicable).
If some of the information required for completion of the Pregnancy  Reporting Form is 
unavailable at the time of the initial report, follow- up re ports will be completed and submitted 
within 24 hours of becoming aware of the new information. The investigator is required to 
follow the pregnancy  through delivery . The outcome of the pregnancy  and the status of the 
newborn (if applicable) will be report ed on the Pregnancy  Reporting Form within 24 hours of 
becoming aware.

The investigator is required to follow SAEs until resolution regardless of whether the subjects 
are still participating in the study . SAE resolution is defined as:
•Resolved with or without residual effects.
•A return to baseline for a pre -existing condition.
•Laboratory  values have returned to baseline or stabilized.
•The investigator does not expect any  further improvement or worsening of the event.

exposure to open -label DX -2930 in this study , or medical conditions present prior to the start of 
treatment but increasing in severity or relationship at the time of or following the start of 
treatment. For AEs with partial onset ti mes, non- missing date parts will be used to determine if 
the AE is treatment- emergent or not.  If a determination cannot be made using the non -missing 
date parts as to when the AE occurred relative to study  drug administration, then the AE will be 
classifi ed as treatment -
emergent.
The anal yses described in this section will be based on treatment- emergent AEs; plainly  referred 
to as AEs in this section for brevit y.  
Related AEs are AEs classified as related to stud y drug b y the investigator.  Severe AEs are AEs 
classified as severe (grade 3) or life threatening (grade 4) b y the investigator.
For this anal ysis, AEs will be classified to one of two analysis periods:
•Treatment Period AEs will include all AEs starting at or after the first exposure to open -label
DX-[ADDRESS_1186344]’s last visit date during the 
treatment period in this study  (AEs starting at or after treatment on Day  0 to the Day  364
visit). 
Follow -up Period AEs will include all AEs starting at or after the subject’s last visit date of the 
treatment period in this study  (AEs starting after the Day  364 visit).

DIVISION OF MICROBIOLOGY AND INFECTIOUS 
DISEASES (DMID) ADULT TOXICITY TABLE  
NOVEMBER 2007  
DRAFT
Note:   The following toxicity table is  a DRAFT and designed to provide general guidance 
on parameters  for monitoring safety in clinical trials.   This toxicity table is not  comprehensive and 
should not be applie d directly  to all trials.    
When selecting a toxicity table, the following are some of the items that must be taken into 
consideration:  
•The population being studied
oDoes the clinical trial evaluate healthy subjects ,
 subject s with a particular disease
or condition?
•The stage of test article development
oIs the clinical tr ial a Phase I, II, III or IV?
•The type of  test article
oDoes the clinical trial evaluate a drug,  device,  vacci
ne or  other biologic agent?
•The prior human and preclinical experience with the
 test article
oAre there any specific findings that require adjustment 
of the toxicity table?
Single site clinical trials evaluating healthy 
subjects s hould conform to the laboratory normal 
values  at the single site. Multi -center clinical trials should reconcile among their laboratory normal 
values when evaluating a healthy volunteer population.  
Please confer with the DMID protocol team and DMID's Office of Clinical Research Affairs  when 
selecting or developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a toxicity table for a DMID -sponsored trial.

ESTIMATING SEVERITY GRAD E  
For abnormalities NOT found elsewhere in the Toxicity Tables use the scale below to estimate grade of severity:  
GRADE 1  Mild    Transient or mild discomfort  
 (< 48 hours); no m edical intervent
ion/therapy required  
GRADE 2  Moderate   Mild to moderate limitation in 
activity - some assistance may be needed; no or minimal 
medical intervention/therapy required  
GRADE 3  Sever e    Marked limitation in activity, some 
assistance usually requ ired; medical intervention/therapy 
required, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_281925] 4  Life-threatening  Extreme limitation in activity, 
significant assistance required; significant medical intervention/therapy required, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_281926] -THREATENING AEs  
 
ANY clinical event deemed by [CONTACT_852864] -threatening should be 
considered a grade  4 event.  Clinical events considered to be serious or life -threatening 
include, but are not limited to:  seizures, coma , tetany, diabetic ketoacidosis, 
disseminated intravascular coagulation, diffuse petechiae, paralysis, acute psychosis, 
severe depression.  
 
COMMENTS REGARDING THE USE OF THESE TAB LES  
 
• Standardized and commonly used toxicity tables (Division of AIDS, NCI’ s 
Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC), a
nd World Health Organization (WHO)) have 
been adapted for use by [CONTACT_71513] 
(DMID) and modified to better meet the needs of participants in DMID trials.  
 
•  For parameters not included in t
he following Toxicity Tables, sites should refer to 
the “Guide For Estimating Severity Grade”  located above.  
 
• Criteria are generally grouped by
 [CONTACT_6764].  
 
• Some protocols may have additiona
l protocol specific grading criteria, which will 
supercede the use of these tables for specified criteria.

DRAFT

Note:   The following toxicity table is  a DRAFT and designed to provide general guidance 
on parameters  for monitoring safety in clinical trials.   This toxicity table is not  comprehensive and should 
not be applie d directly  to all trials.    
  
When selecting a toxicity table, the following are some of 
the items that must be taken into consideration:  
  
• The population being studied  
o Does the clinical trial evaluate healthy subjects , subj
ects with a particular disease or 
condition?  
• The stage of test article dev elopment  
o Is the clinical tr ial a Phase I  (is it for the fisrt t
ime in human subjects?) , II, III or IV?  
• The type of  test article   
o Does the clinical trial evaluate a drug,  device,  vaccine 
or other biologic agent?  
• The prior human and preclinical experience with the  test a
rticle  
o Are there any specific findings that require adjustment of  the 
toxicity table?  
o Has it been approved for this indication in adult populatio
n? 
  
Single site clinical trials evaluating healthy subjec
ts should conform to the laboratory normal values  at the 
single site. Multi -center clinical trials should reconcile among their laboratory normal values when 
evaluating a healthy volunteer population.  
  
Please confer with the DMID protocol team and DM
ID's Office of Clinical Research Affairs  when selecting 
or developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a toxicity table for a DMID -sponsored trial.

ESTIMATING SEVERITY GRAD E  
For abnormalities NOT found elsewhere in the Toxicity Tables use the scale below to estimate 
grade of severity:  
GRADE 1  Mild    Transient or mild discomfort  
 (< 48 hours); no medical intervention/therapy required  
GRADE 2  Moderate   Mild to moderate limitation in activity - 
some assistance may be needed; no or minimal medical intervention/therapy required  
GRADE 3  Sever e    Marked limitation in activity, some 
assistance usually required; medical intervention/therapy required, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_126691] 4  Life-threatening  Extreme limitation in activity, significant 
assistance  required; significant medical intervention/therapy 
required, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_852704] 5                              Death  
 
SERIOUS OR LIFE- THREATENING AEs  
 
ANY clinical event deemed by [CONTACT_941] c
linician to be serious or life -threatening  should be 
considered a grade  4 event.  Clinical events considered to be serious or life -threatening include, 
but are not limited to:  seizures, coma, tetany, diabetic ketoacidosis, disseminated intravascular 
coagulation, diffuse petechiae, paralysis, acut e psychosis, severe depression.  
 
COMMENTS REGARDING THE USE OF THESE TAB LES  
 
• Standardized and commonly used toxic
ity tables (Division of AIDS, NCI’s Common 
Toxicity Criteria (CTC), and World Health Organization (WHO)) have been adapted for 
use by [CONTACT_852812] d Infectiou s Di seases (DMID) an d m odified to 
better meet the needs of participants in DMID trials.  
 •  
For parameters not included in the 
following Toxicity Tables, sites should refer to the 
“Guide For Estimating Severity Grade”  located above.  
 • 
Criteria are generally grouped by b
ody system.  
 
• Some protocols may have additional protocol specific grading criteria, which will 
supercede the use of these ta
bles for specified criteria.

1 PURPOSE 
This document applies to clinical trials that involve investigator adjudication/assessment of 
angioedema attacks. The purpose of this document is to provide a definition of an HA E 
attack and to define a standardized set of procedures for the reporting and assessment of events reported by [CONTACT_852814].  
[ADDRESS_1186448] one of the following locations:  
• Peripheral angioedema: cutaneous swelling involving an extremity, the face, neck, torso, 
and/or genitourinary region 
• Abdominal angioedema: abdominal pain, with or without abdominal distention, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea 
• Laryngeal angioedema: stridor, dyspnea, difficulty speaking, difficulty swallowing, throat tightening, or swelling of the tongue, palate, uvula, or larynx 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_852689], the inv estigator may still determine clinically that 
the event did not represent an HAE attack if there are features that strongly refute such a 
diagnosis. For example, the reported event is accompanied by [CONTACT_852815] (e.g., urticaria), the reported event persists well beyond the typi[INVESTIGATOR_852714] (e.g., greater than 7 days), or there is a likely alternate etiology  for 
the event (e.g., the subject’s abdominal symptoms are attributable to a viral gastroenteritis outbreak in the household). 
To be counted as a unique attack distinct from their previous attack, the new symptoms must 
occur at least 24 hours after resolution of the prior attack’s symptoms.  
Attack resolution is defined as the subject no longer having symptoms of the attack. Prodromal symptoms by [CONTACT_852816]. Patient report of use of acute HAE attack treatment for an attack by [CONTACT_852817].  
[ADDRESS_1186449] HAE attack history will be collected by [CONTACT_852818]. Information collected will include any prior history of laryngeal attacks, attack frequency, average severity, predominant location(s), average duration, acute attack therapy use, and history of long- term prophylaxis.  
During the relevant study periods, as defined in the applicable study protocol, subjects (or caregivers, for subjects < 18 years old) will be instructed to c ontact the site within [ADDRESS_1186450] is incapacitated and is

subject uses to track this information are not intended to serve as source documents for the study.  
Site personnel will review the information provided by [CONTACT_852819].  Information documented by [CONTACT_852820].  
A designated individual at the site (the collector) will contact [CONTACT_34658] a 
regular basis as defined in the study protocol, regardless of whether or not the subject has 
reported any attacks, in order to solicit for any attacks that may have occurred but were not reported. In addition, during each study visit, site personnel will solicit for any new attack information that was not provided through previous contact [CONTACT_222198] . 
The Investigator or designee (the assessor) will review the attack information  and evaluate if 
the event represents a confirmed HAE attack. If necessary for the evaluation, the investigator or designee may contact [CONTACT_852821].  
3.[ADDRESS_1186452]-Reported Symptoms 
Subjects and caregivers can use any exi sting methods by [CONTACT_852822] , or, if requested, memory aids can be provided by [CONTACT_3452]. However, 
subjects (or a caregiver) will need to track attacks in such a way as to be able to contact [CONTACT_523083], but not later than 72 hours (3 full days) after the first symptoms appear, to report the information. 
3.1.[ADDRESS_1186453] (or caregiver) at the time they 
are reporting an attack to the site: 
• Date and time symptoms of an attack were first experienced  
• Description of symptoms experienced, including location(s) 
• Impact on activity and whether any assistance or medical intervention was required , 
including hospi[INVESTIGATOR_623464]  
• Any medications used to treat the attack  
• If the attack resolved, date and time the subject was no longer experiencing symptoms  
Subjects do not have to wait for their symptoms to completely resolve to report an attack. 
Information about ongoing symptoms can be obtained by [CONTACT_852823]- in call 
and/ or at a scheduled study visit. Subjects should not withhold or delay any treatment they would normally receive to treat their attack in order contact [CONTACT_779].

•If the subject only experienced prodromal symptoms
•If  the subject experienced anything different than their typi[INVESTIGATOR_852715]
•If there were any possible alternative etiologies of the symptoms. For example, a viralgastroenteritis outbreak in the household could explain abdominal symptoms
The overall severity of the subject’s attack will be determined by [CONTACT_852825]: 
- Mild: Transient or mild discomfort  
- Moderate: Mild to moderate limitation in activity - some assistance needed  
- Severe: Marked limitation in activity, assistance required

The site will also document the date and time of investigator or designee review, the official 
designation of the event as an attack or not, and if applicable, the reason why an event is not considered an attack.  
All reported attacks will be entered by [CONTACT_852826] 
(eCRF ). 
3.2.[ADDRESS_1186461] HAE attacks will 
need to pass a “Collector” training assessment covering the following: 
•definition of an HAE attack
•requirements of subjects and caretakers for reporting attacks
•reporting worsening symptoms and multiple attacks
•information to be collected from subjects and caregivers as well as the additional probing
questions to gather context for the attack information provided
•assessment of attack severity
•entry of the attack data into the eCRF
•reporting HAE attacks as adverse events
•requirements for Investigator assessment of attacks
Trainings will be conducted prior to sites screening subjects.  Trainings will be documented 
in the Trial Master File. Investigators and designees will be trained on these procedures as 
well and must pass an “Assessor” training in order to officially assess attacks for this study. 
All responsible persons involved in the collection of information from subjects or assessing attacks must be listed on FDA Form 1572.

The assessor must review the information and determine whether the event is an actual attack 
or not. If needed, the assessor can contact [CONTACT_3184]/or caregiver to clarify infor mation 
or ask for any additional detail. The determination will be documented along with the date and time the determination was made. Any event deemed not an attack must be accompanied by [CONTACT_852827].  
When rev iewing subject information, the assessor will follow the definitions of an attack as 
outlined in these procedures and, taking all available information about the event into 
consideration, will determine if it is a confirmed attack. The assessment of the attack is the Investigator or designee’s own, and not the opi[INVESTIGATOR_121479], the subject’s caregiver or any other site personnel. Assessors may consult with one another about a particular subject’s attack but only one assessor makes the documented determination. It is possible for both the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_852716].

APPENDIX 5 Summary of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_852691]-2930-03 in Subjects with HAE
The proposed pi[INVESTIGATOR_306339]  (Study  DX-2930 -03) is entitled “HELP StudyTM: A 
Multicenter, Randomized, Double- Blind, Placebo
-Controlled Efficacy  and Safety  Study  to 
Evaluate DX -[ADDRESS_1186464] Acute Attacks of Hereditary  
Angioe dema (HAE).” This study  will be a multi -center, double- blind, randomized, placebo-
controlled parallel -arm study  evaluating the efficacy  of DX -2930 in preventing acute 
angioedema attacks in patients with Ty pe I or Ty pe II HAE. The double -blind study  is plan
ned to 
be followed b y the stud y described in the present protocol, an open -label extension (OLE) study
(DX-2930- 04).
The primary  objective of S tudy DX-
2930- 03 is to evaluate the efficacy  of DX -2930 in 
preventing HAE attacks. The secondary  objective is to e valuate the safet y of repeated SC 
administrations of DX- 2930. The tertiary  objectives are to evaluate the pharmacody namic effects 
of chronically  administered DX -2930; to assess the immunogenicit y of chronically administered 
DX-2930; to evaluate the pharmac okinetics of chronically  administered DX -2930; and to 
evaluate the effect of DX -[ADDRESS_1186465] 4 weeks. HAE subjects 
will then be randomized 2:1 to receive repeated subcutaneous (SC) administrations of DX
-2930 
or placebo in a double -blind fashion.  Subjects who are randomized to DX -2930 will be assigned 
in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of three dose regimens: [ADDRESS_1186466] dose on Day  0 through Day  
182
Subjects may  consent to rollover into the OLE study (present protocol D X-2930- 04) upon 
completion of their participation in the double -blind treatment period.
The primary  endpoint will be to compare the number of investigator -confirmed HAE attacks 
observed in each DX -2930 treatment arm to that in the placebo arm during the ef ficacy  
assessment period (Day  0through Day  182).

Description and Rationale for Change Section(s) Affected by 
[CONTACT_64737]
A new tertiary objective and related measurement have been added to evaluate 
exploratory biomarker(s) of angioedema disease -state bioactivity in blood. Additional 
biomarker assessments have been added to the study to evaluate the effect of DX -
2930 on disease activity. 
Objective: To evaluate exploratory biom arker(s) of angioedema disease -state 
bioactivity in blood
Measurement : Exploratory biomarker(s) of angioedema disease state bioactivity 
in plasma and serum
A new tertiary efficacy objective and related measurement have been added to better 
understand the clinical response to rescue medications while on DX -2930 therapy.
Objective: To assess the clinical response of rescue medications for the treatment 
of acute angioedema attacks while on DX -2930 therapy (applicable for subjects 
≥18 years of age)
Measurement: Subject response to rescue medications
A new tertiary objective has been added to assess subjects’ satisfaction with DX -
2930. 
Objective: To assess treatm ent satisfaction
Measurement: Treatment satisfaction will be measured using Treatment 
Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM -9). The TSQM -9 is a 9 -item 
validated instrument.
A new tertiary objective has been added to assess subjects’ and investig ators’ overall 
perception of treatment response.
Objective: To assess global impression of treatment response

A brief exit interview has been added to obtain information about subjects’ 
overall experience with DX -[ADDRESS_1186477] year.  Key refinements represented in Table 2 include:
The frequency of on -site visits has been decrease d so that subjects are 
only required to come to the clinic once every 2 months (instead of once 
a month or once every third visit, as appropriate for each subject)
The requirement that each attack be confirmed by [CONTACT_19452] 72 
hours for non -serious AE attacks has been expanded to 7calendar days. 
(Note: This refers only to confirmation of attacks, notreporting of SAEs or 
AEs.)   ECGs will be assessed through Day 364, at the end of the study, and

Study Design:
Study  DX-2930- [ADDRESS_1186483] (IMP), DX- 2930, in preventing 
acute angioedema attacks in patients with Ty pe I and Ty pe II HAE. There are two types of 
subjects who will be enrolled into this study :
•Subjects who rollover from Study DX-2930-03 
•Subjects who are non -rollover (ie, were not participant s in Study DX-
2930- 03) 
Rollover Subjects
Rollover subjects are subjects who complete the double- blind treatment period at Day  [ADDRESS_1186484] Study DX-
2930- 04 visit for rollover subjects (Day  0) 
will occur on the same day  as the Study DX-2930- 03 Day  182 study  visit. Rollover subjects will 
complete all Study DX
-2930 -03 final study  assessments (Day  182) at which time they  will be 
discharged from that study. No assessments conducted be tween the Study DX-2930- [ADDRESS_1186485] Study DX-2930- 04 visit (Day 0) will be duplicated. Results of the final 
Study DX-2930- [ADDRESS_1186486] 50 subjects (to approximately  100) who were not participants in Study DX-2930- [ADDRESS_1186487] wait until enrollment for the double -blind study  has ended before they  can screen for Study
DX-2930- 04. The Sponsor may  ease this restriction based on the enrollment rate observed in 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 8

DX-2930- 04 29 June 2017
Study DX-2930- 03. Subjects who are still in the run -in period for Stud yDX-2930- 03 when 
enrollment for that stud y closes, as well as subjects on prior LTP who screen fail out of Study  
DX-2930- 03 due to an inability  to wash- out of their L TP, may  screen for Study DX-2930-04 
following discussion with the Sponsor medical monitor.
Screening Period:
Rollover Subjects
There is no screening period for rollover subjects.
Non-rollover Subjects
Non-rollover subjects must provide informed consent and have screening assessments completed 
within [ADDRESS_1186488] open -label dose. Screened non- rollover subjects (adults an d 
adolescents) who are on LTP with C1-INH therapy for HAE can continue their current LTP until 
Day 8 (or Day  15) such that subjects will have received 2 (or 4) doses of C1- INH. ( It is 
understood that C1- INH therap y ma y alter the lab results of C1 -INH asses sments; therefore, the 
investigator's discretion in collaboration with Medical Monitor is advised for proper 
documentation of eligibility ). For subjects who are on attenuated androgens (eg, danazol) or anti-
fibrinoly tics (eg, tranexamic acid), a similar ta pering schedule is recommended. However, the 
taper can be prolonged by  [CONTACT_260758], if medically  indicated, as long as androgen or anti -
fibrinoly tic therapy  is stopped within [ADDRESS_1186489] dose of DX-2930.  
Treatment Period:
Rollover Subjects
Following informed consent and pre -dose assessments, rollover subjects will receive a single 
open -label dose of 300 mg DX -2930 administered subcutaneousl y (SC) on Day  0. Subjects will 
not receive an y additional DX -[ADDRESS_1186490] adhere to the Study Activities Schedules ( Table 1 
andTable 2) for the entire duration of the stud y.  However, until a rollover subject reports their 
first HAE attack, onl y scheduled study visits where the following tests a nd assessments are 
performed must be conducted at the investigative site: pregnancy  testing, clinical laboratory  
testing, ph ysical examination, [ADDRESS_1186491] 
information on adverse events, concomitant therapy , and HAE attack data.  See Study  Activities 
Schedules ( Table 1 andTable 2 ) for which visits must be conducted at the study  site.
Once a rollover subject reports th eir first HAE attack they  will present to the investigative site 
for their second open -label dose of DX -[ADDRESS_1186492] and site schedules allow.  If 
the second dose is to be administered within the accepted ±4 day  window around a scheduled 
study visit, this treatment visit will represent that scheduled visit. If that scheduled visit has 
alread y occurred, the day of the visit will be considered an acceptable, extra study  visit (ie, an 
unscheduled visit).  Similarly , if the second dose is administ ered outside of the accepted ±4 day  
window around a scheduled visit, the day  of the visit will be considered an acceptable extra 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 9
Clinical Trial Protocol Am endment 3
DX-2930- 04 29 June 2017
unscheduled stud y visit, (ie, this visit will not replace an y scheduled visit). 
Regardless of the stud y day, at the visit in which the second open -label dose of DX -[ADDRESS_1186493]’s first HAE attack occurs, there will be a minimum of 
10days between their f irst open -label dose and their second open -label dose. Following their 
second open- label dose, rollover subjects will continue to receive repeated SC administrations of 
open -label [ADDRESS_1186494]’s second dose, but will not 
exceed [ADDRESS_1186495] been completed and eligibility  confirmed, non -rollover 
subjects will arrive at the study  site and, following pre -dose assessments, receive an open- label 
dose of 300 mg DX -2930 administered SC on Day 0. Non- rollover subjects will continue to 
receive SC administrations of open- label 300 mg DX -2930 every  2 weeks throughout the 
duration of the treatment period per the scheduled dosing in the Study  Activities Schedules.
All Subjects:
All doses (with the exception of the second dose for rollover subjects) require a minimum of 
10days and maximum of 18 day s between administration s and should fall within the accepted 
±4 day  window around study  visits.
After the second DX -2930 dose is given either within the study  window (±4 day s) or an 
acceptable extra study  visit, the 3rddose must be administered at the next pre -defined study  visit 
according to the schedule of assessments.
If a subject experiences an acute angioedema attack at any  time during the study  that in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_852717], standard of care therap y should be 
provided based on subject’s medical history  and per locall y approved product information. 
Administration of DX- [ADDRESS_1186496] receives treatment for a breakthrough angioedema 
attack on the day  of a scheduled dose of stu dy drug (if self -administering) or scheduled study  
visit.
Self Administration
All subjects (adolescent or adult) who are considered suitable candidates (ie, those with a 
physical and mental capability  of learning and willing to be trained) may  be allowed t o self -
administer treatment. Subjects must complete appropriate training b y the investigator or designee 
and understanding of the training must be confirmed by [CONTACT_1719]. Subjects are 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 10
Clinical Trial Protocol Am endment 3
DX-2930- 04 29 June 2017
allowed to initiate self- administration at the subjec t’s home, or other agreed upon location after 
receiving the first 2 doses of DX- 2930 at the study  site. Once initiated, subjects may  self-
administer subsequent doses of DX -2930 at the investigational site (when visits are scheduled 
study  site visits) or the subject’s home or other agreed upon location (when the study  permits off -
site dosing). See Schedule of Activities for details. Adolescent subjects self- administering 
investigational product will be supervised by  a parent/legal guardian/caregiver. Alterna tively , a 
parent/legal guardian/caregiver, after completing appropriate training, will be allowed to 
administer DX -[ADDRESS_1186497] been appropriately documented.
Throughout the stud y, study  site personnel will document information in source d ocuments (ie, 
the subject’s medical record) and eCRF regarding the subject’s experience with self-
administration and SC administration of DX -2930.
Subjects may  be offered the opportunity  to utilize a prefilled s yringe (if available) for self -
administration of DX -2930.
Follow -up Period
After completion of the treatment period, all subjects will undergo safet y evaluations during a 
4-week follow -up period.
Modifications to Open -Label Dosing
If, at an y time, a dose -related safety  signal is identified either fr om this study  or Study
DX-2930- 03, the Sponsor may  decide to modify  the open -label DX -2930 dose and/or frequency . 
In addition, an individual subject’s dose may be modified based on a benefit -risk assessment and 
recommendati on from the treating phy sician. Consultation with and approval by  [CONTACT_1034]’s 
Medical Monitor is required.
In addition, based on the results of Study DX-2930 -03, the Sponsor may  switch to a different 
dose and/or frequency . 
Study Population:
The study  is expected to enroll subjects from Study DX-2930- 03, as well as at least 50 (to 
approximately  100) additional subjects who were not enrolled in Study DX-2930- 03. The total 
enrollment is expected to be at least [ADDRESS_1186498] 15 subjects who are 12 to 17 y ears of age, 
inclusive of the estimated 10 subjects 12 to 17 y ears old who are expected to roll over from 
Study DX-2930-
03.
Criteria for Inclusion:
Subjects must meet the following criteria to be enrolled in this study :

pre-existing illness or other major comorbidit y that the investigator considers may  confound 
the interpretation of study  results).
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page [ADDRESS_1186501]; Dose; and Mode of Administration:
DX-2930 is a sterile, preservative -free solution for injection, pH 6.0. The active ingredient, 
DX-2930, is formulated using the following compendial componen ts: 30 mM sodium phosphate 
dibasic dihy drate, 19.6 mM citric acid, 50 mM histidine, 90 mM sodium chloride, 
0.01% Polysorbate 80. Each open -label vial contains a nominal concentration of [ADDRESS_1186502] will receive a total of 2 mL, which will be 
administered in a single 2 -mL SC injection. 
The injection will be given in the upper arm, thigh or abdomen.
Self-Administration Op tion: I nvestigational product can be self- administered without supervision 
(parental supervision required for adolescent subjects) after subjects receive appropriate training 
by [CONTACT_852768]. Subjects ar e allowed to 
initiate offsite self -administration after receiving the first 2 doses of DX
-2930 at the study  site 
and may  continue to self -administer all subsequent doses (see Study  Activities Schedules).
Duration of Treatment:
All subjects will receive open -label DX -[ADDRESS_1186503] dose administered on Day  0 and the final dose administered at the Day  
910 study  visit.
There will be a ± 4-day window around each study  visit. There will be a minimum of [ADDRESS_1186504]  from 
the investigational site .
Duration of Study for Individual Subjects:
Following informed consent, subjects will either rollover from DX -2930-03 or undergo 
screening asse ssments (non- rollover subjects). Screening assessments for non -rollover subjects 
must occur within [ADDRESS_1186505] open -label dose. Eligible subjects will be enrolled 
and undergo a treatment period of up to 924 day s. At the conclusion of the tre atment period, 
subjects will be followed for an additional 4 weeks. 
Prohibited Concomitant Treatments:
Use of the following treatments will not be permitted during the stud y:
•Long -term prophy laxis for HAE (eg, use of C1 -INH for LTP, attenuated androgens, or anti -
fibrinoly tics) once LTP is discontinued (within [ADDRESS_1186506] dose of 
DX-2930). 
•Angiotensin- converting enzy me (ACE) inhibitors.

•Initiating or changing the dose of estrogen -containing medications with sy stemic absorption 
(such as ora l contraceptives or hormonal replacement therapy ) 3 months prior to study  
screening.
•Use of androgens (eg, stanozolol, danazol, oxandrolone, methy ltestosterone, and 
testosterone) for non- HAE related medical conditions or for HAE after discontinuation 
during the first three weeks.
•Any other investigational drug or device.
The use of short -term prophy lactic treatment for HAE will be permitted if medically  indicated. 
Short -term (pre -procedure) proph ylaxis is defined as the use of C1 -INH to avoid angioedema 
complications from medically  indicated procedures.
Management of Acute Attacks:
Acute HAE attacks during the study are to be managed in accord with the investigator’s usual 
care of their patients, including the use of acute attack therapi[INVESTIGATOR_852726]. Use of C1- INH will be permitted as an acute attack therap y but not as a 
long-term prophy lactic therapy . Administration of DX -[ADDRESS_1186507] has s ymptoms of 
an HAE attack the day  of DX -2930 administration and/or receives treatment for an HAE attack. 
The administration of DX -[ADDRESS_1186508] preference or phy sician discretion.
Safety Assessments:
Safety  assessments will include the following:
•Adverse events (AEs), including serious adverse events (SAEs) and adverse events of special 
interest (AESI). SAEs and AESI  will be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours of becoming 
aware of the event.
•Vital signs, including sitting or supi[INVESTIGATOR_9204] (BP), heart rate (HR), body  
temperature, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_2842] (RR)
•Physical examination
•Clinical laboratory  testing (hematology ,serum chemistry , coagulation, and urinaly sis)
•12-Lead electrocardiogram (ECG) 
Adverse events of special interest (AESI) will be captured and monitored during this study . 
Hypersensitivity  reactions and events of disordered coagulation will be considered AESI.
Pharmacokinetic (PK) Assessments:
Blood samples will be collected for the measurement of plasma DX -2930 concentrations.
Pharmacodynamic (PD) Assessments:
Blood samples will be collected to evaluate the pharmacod ynamic effects of DX -2930 through 
biomarker assay s.
Immunogenicity Assessments:
Blood samples will be collected to assay  for the presence of anti-drug antibodies, including 
evaluation of neutralizing antibodies (if an y confirmed positive anti- drug antibodies are 
detected).

C1-INH, C4, an d C1q and Exploratory Biomarker Assessments:
Samples for C1 -INH, C4, and C1q assay s will be obtained at screening for eligibility assessment, 
unless alread y collected as part of protocol DX -[ADDRESS_1186509] of DX -2930 on these biomarkers of disease activity .
Quality of Life Assessments:
Quality  of life (QoL) assessments will be conducted using the Angioedema Quality  of L ife 
Questionnaire (AE -QoL), EuroQoL 5- Dimensional 5 -Level Measure (EQ -5D-5L), Work 
Productivity  and Activit y Impairment Questionnaire: General Health (WPAI -GH), Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_710196] (HADS), and 12 Item Short Form Survey  (SF-12), the 
Angioe dema Control Test (AECT), the Global Impression of Treatment Response, and 
Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM- 9). Additionally , subjects will 
complete a brief exit interview to obtain data on the subjects’ experience in the DX -[ADDRESS_1186510]’s experience with self -administration and SC injection will be 
completed b y the subject after all doses of DX -2930.
In addition, an assessment survey  of the subject experience with SC and self -administration 
injections of DX -2930, and the prefilled s yringe (if utilized), will be completed b y the subject as 
indicated in the Study  Activities Schedules.
Collection of HAE Attack Data:
The collection, reporting and assessment of attacks in this study  will be done in accordance with 
the HAE Attack Assessment and Reporting Procedures (HAARP). Study  site personnel will be 
trained on HAARP prior to screening and enrolling subjects at their site.
Study  site personnel will train subjects and caregivers on identifying s ymptoms of an attack, the 
requirements for reporting attacks and the information they  will be expected to provide. The 
subject (and caregiver) will confirm their understanding of what is required of them for reporting 
attacks to the site.
At screening, HAE attack history  will be collected for non- rollover subjects. I nformation 
collected will include any prior history  of lary ngeal attacks, attack frequency , average severit y, 
predom inant attack location(s), triggers, average duration, acute attack therapy  use and history  of 
LTP (including duration of L TP, medication(s) and dose used for LTP, and frequency  of attacks 
while receiving LTP). If available, information will also be collect ed on HAE diagnosis (y ear of 
confirmation, how man y years after onset of s ymptoms was diagnosis confirmed, or if subject 
was misdiagnosed).
During the study , subjects (or caregivers) will be instructed to notify  and report details to the 
study  site within [ADDRESS_1186511] in tracking any HAE attacks experienced, but their use is

•Peripheral angioedema: cutaneous swelling involving an extremity , the face, neck, torso, 
and/or genitourinary  region.
•Abdominal angioedema: abdominal pain, with or without abdominal distention, nausea, 
vomiting, or diarrhea.
•Lary ngeal angioedema: stridor, dy spnea, difficult y speaking, difficult y swallowing, throat 
tightening, or swelling of the tongue, palate, uvula, or larynx.
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_852664] s ymptoms, the investigator or phy sician designee may still 
clinically  determine that the event did not represent an attack if there are features that strongl y 
refute such a diagnosis. For example, the reported event is accompanied b y symptoms that are 
not consistent with an HAE attack (eg, urticaria), the reported event persists well bey ond the 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_852665], or there is a likely  alternate etiology  for the event (eg, the 
subject’s abdominal s ymptoms are attributable to a viral gastroenteritis outbreak in the 
household). 
To be counted as a unique attack distinct from the previous attack, the new sy mptoms must occur 
at least 24 hours after resolution of the prior attack’s sy mptoms.
Interim Analyses and Data Monitoring
Interim anal yses may  be conducted when a reasonable number ofsubjects have completed at 
least 12 months of consecutive exposure to DX- 2930 across the combined DX -2930- 03 and 
DX-2930- 04 studies, and only  after database lock of Study  DX-2930-03. Interim anal yses may  
be performed to support administrative decisions and/or regulatory  reporting.
An independent Data Safety  Monitoring Board (DSMB) has been established to provide 
ongoing, independent review and assessment of the safet y data f or Study DX-2930- 03. While an 
independent DSMB is not currentl y planned for this study , summary  safety  data from Study  DX-
2930- 04 may  be reviewed by  [CONTACT_852835]-2930
-03 DSMB as part of the collection of safet y 
information available on DX -2930. 
Individual Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1869]:
Dosing for an y individual subject will be discontinued if the subject experiences a 
DX-2930- related SAE (or a DX -2930- related, clinically  significant non-serious AE) that, in the 
assessment of the investigator, warrants discontinuation fr om further dosing for that subject’s 
well-being. The investigator has the ability  to contact [CONTACT_852772]. Subjects will continue to be followed through the completion of all scheduled non -
dosing visits, unless they request to be discontinued from the study .

Sample Size Determination:
No formal sample size calculation was performed.  The sample size is not based on an y 
statistical considerations.  This study  is designed to evaluate the safet y and efficacy  of open- label 
treatment with DX -2930 in subjects who participated in Study  DX-2930- 03 and individuals who 
were not otherwise able to participate in Study  DX-2930-03.
Statistical Methodology: 
Time to the first investigator-confirmed HAE attack will be anal yzed using the Rollover Safet y 
Population.
Time to the first investigator- confirmed HAE attack (day s) will be calculated from the date and 
time of the first open -label dose of DX -[ADDRESS_1186513] investigator -confirmed HAE 
attack, including but not limited to: baseline attack rate prior to entering Study  DX-2930- 03, the 
treatment group in Study  DX-2930- 03, the time since the last dose given in Study  DX-2930-03, 
the time since the last HAE attack, and the rate of attacks during Study  DX-2930-03. Results of 
this exploratory  anal ysis will be summarized.  
Number of Investigator -confirmed HAE Attacks
The number of investigator- confirmed HAE attacks during the treatment period (Day  0 through 
Day 924) expressed as a monthly  HAE attack rate, will be anal yzed using each analy sis 
population.
The monthly  rate of investigator-confirmed HAE attacks during the treatment period will be 
calculated for each subject as the number of investigator- confirmed HAE attacks occurring 
during the treatment period divided by [CONTACT_28991] s the subject contributed to the 
treatment period multiplied by  [ADDRESS_1186514].
Similar summary  tables will be presented for the following efficacy  endpoints for each anal ysis 
population:
•Number of investigator -confirmed HAE attacks requiring acute treatment during the 
treatment period.
•Number of moderate or severe investigator -confirmed HAE attacks during the treatment 
period.
•Number of high- morbidity  investigator -confirmed HAE attacks during the treatment period; 
a high -morbidity  HAE attack is defined as any  attack that ha s at least one of the following 
characteristics: severe, results in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (except hospi[INVESTIGATOR_28061] 
< 24 hours), hemod ynamically  significant (s ystolic blood pressure < 90, requires IV 
hydration, or associated with sy ncope or near -syncope) or lary ngeal.
Safety Analysis:
Adverse Events
Treatment -emergent AEs are defined as AEs with onset at the time of or following the first 
exposure to open -label DX -2930 in this study , or medical conditions present prior to the start of 
treatment but increasing in severit y or relationship at the time of or following the start of 
treatment. 
The anal yses described in this section will be based on treatment- emergent AEs; plainly  referred 
to as AEs in this section for brevit y.  
Related AEs are AEs classified as related to stud y drug b y the investigator. Severe AEs are AEs 
classified as severe (grade 3) or life threatening (grade 4) b y the investigator.

the lab results of C1 -INH assessments, the investigator's discretion in collaboration with Medical Monitor is advised for proper documentation of 
eligibility.
e Doses are administered every 14 ± 4 days. All subjects (ado lescent or adult) who are considered suitable candidates (ie, those with a physical and 
mental capability of learning and willing to be trained) may be allow ed to self -administer DX -2930 after (1) completing appropriate training by

1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 DX-2930
DX-2930 is a fully  human IgG1 recombinant monoclonal antibody  that binds specificall y to 
active plasma kallikrein. DX -2930 is being developed for proph ylactic treatment of angioedema 
attacks in patients with hereditary  angioedema (HAE), a serious and life -threatening disease.
1.2 Hereditary Angioedema
HAE is a long -term, debilitating, and life- threatening disease caused by  [CONTACT_439081] 
C1-inhibitor (C1- INH) gene, resulting in deficiency  or dy sfunction of C1 -INH protein. HAE 
manifests clinically  as unpredictable, intermittent attacks of subcutaneous or submucosal edema 
of the face, lary nx, gastrointestinal tract, limbs and/or genitalia ( Zuraw 2008). Swelling may last 
up to five or more day s; most patients suffer multiple attacks per y ear. HAE is an orphan 
disorder. The exact prevalence of HAE is unknown, but current estimates range from [ADDRESS_1186544] estimate ( By[CONTACT_281998] 2009 ; Goring et al. 1998 ; Lei et al. 2011 ; Nordenfelt et al. 2014; [COMPANY_002] 
et al. 2005). 
Swelling in the lary nx can obstruct the airways and cause death from asphyxiation ( Bork et al. 
2000; Bork et al. 2012 ). Approximately  50% of all patients with HAE will experience a 
laryngeal attack in their lifetime, and there is no way  to predict which patients are at risk of a 
laryngeal attack ( Bork et al. 2003 ; Bork et al. 2006 ). 
Abdominal attacks are often associated with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and severe pain; 
intestinal sy mptoms resembling abdominal emergencies may lead to unnecessary  surgery  (Zuraw 
2008). 
Approximately  85% of patients with HAE have Ty pe I HAE, characterized by  [CONTACT_852870] C1 -INH protein, while the remaining approximately  15% of 
patients with HAE have Ty pe II HAE and produce normal or elevated levels of a functionall y 
impaired C1 -INH ( Zuraw 2008 ). In patients with Ty pes I and II HAE, uncontrolled plasma 
kallikrein generation results in excess brady kinin release from high -molecular weight 2- chain 
kininogen (HMWK) and vascular leak mediated by [CONTACT_852871] B2 receptor (B2 -
R) 
on the surface of endothelial cells ( Zuraw 2008 ). Clinical suspi[INVESTIGATOR_852667] I and II HAE can 
be confirmed b y availabl e blood tests. I n addition to abnormalities in C1 -INH level and function, 
plasma C4 levels are often reduced in blood from most patients with HAE.
1.3 Therapeutic Rationale for DX-2930
Plasma kallikrein play s a critical role in the pathogenesis of HAE attacks ( Davis 2006; Kaplan 
and Joseph 2010). I n normal phy siology , C1-INH regulates the activity  of plasma kallikrein as 
well as a variet y of other proteases, such as C1r, C1s, factor XIa, and factor XIIa. Plasma 
kallikrein regulates the release of brad ykinin from HM WK. Due to a deficiency  of C1 -INH in 
HAE, uncontrolled plasma kallikrein activity occurs and leads to the excessive generation of 
bradykinin. Brad ykinin is a vasodilator which is thought to be responsible for the characteristic 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 38
Clinical Trial Protocol Am endment 3
DX-2930- 04 29 June 2017
HAE sy mptoms of localized sw elling, inflammation, and pain ( Craig et al. 2012; Zuraw et al. 
2013). Intervening at the level of brad ykinin production with a plasma kallikrein inhibitor 
therefore represents an attractive and rational therapeutic strategy  for HAE. I ndeed, the 
importance of plasma kallikrein as a drug target in HAE has been validated through the observed 
effectiveness of Kalbitor®(ecallantide), a peptide that specificall y targets plasma kallikrein, 
which was approved b y the FDA for the treatment of acute HA E attacks ( Kalbitor®2015). 
DX-2930 is a highly  potent and specific inhibitor of plasma kallikrein (K i = 125 pM). X -ray 
crystallograph y of DX- 2930 combined with plasma kallikrein demonstrates DX -2930 binding to 
the active site of kallikrein ( Kenniston et al. 2014 ).
1.[ADDRESS_1186545] -in-human study  with DX -2930 in health y 
subjects, did not identify  any safet y concerns. Single doses up to 3 mg/kg of DX- 2930 were well -
tolerated. There were no dose -limiting toxicities, serious adverse events, or any  other safet y 
concerns identified.
Pharmacokinetic (PK) data from the Phase 1a (DX -2930- 01) and Phase 1b (DX -2930- 02) 
clinical studies in conjunction with data from the nonclinical toxicity  studies support a wide 
safet y margin. The mean C maxfor human subjects treated at a dose of 300 mg on Day s 1 and 15 
was approximately  27 g/mL . As comparison, a mean C maxof 744 g/ mL was observed 
following dosing of monkey s with 50 mg/kg DX -2930 subcutaneous (SC) weekl y for 6 months 
resulting in a safet y margin of approximately  28-fold. No toxicologically  significant findings 
were observed in these treated animals or in any  other nonclinical toxicity  study  to date for 
systemicall y administered DX -2930.
Safety  data is also available from the Phase 1b study  (DX -2930- 02), a multiple -ascending dose 
study  in patients with HAE . In this study , two doses of DX-
2930 up to 400 mg administered 
14days apart were well -tolerated. There were no dose -limiting toxicities, serious adverse events 
in any  DX-2930 treated subje cts, or an y other safety concerns identified in this study  of patients 
with HAE . Pharmacokinetic data from the 1b study  found that the drug exposure following two 
administrations of DX- 2930 (up to a maximum of 400 mg) was substantially  less than that 
attained and evaluated in the nonclinical toxicity  studies.

1.6 DX-2930 Clinical Data
The clinical development program to date for DX -2930 consists of 2 studies to evaluate the 
safet y, tolerabilit y, and PK of DX -2930, including one completed Phase 1a single -ascending 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 39
Clinical Trial Protocol Am endment 3
DX-2930- 04 29 June 2017
dose study  in healthy  subjects and a Phase 1b multiple -ascending dose study  in patients with 
HAE. These studies are summarized in the following sections.
1.6.1 Single -Ascending Dose Study in Healthy Subjects (DX -2930-01)
DX-2930-01 was a Phas e 1a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study  in health y 
subjects to evaluate the safet y, tolerability, and PK following a single, SC dose of DX -
2930. 
Participating subjects were randomized to receive placebo or active stud y drug within one of th e 
following sequential, ascending dose cohorts: 0.1, 0.3, 1.0, or 3.0 mg/kg. For each dosing cohort, 
6 subjects were randomized to receive active drug and 2 subjects to receive placebo. 
A total of 32 subjects enrolled in the study  and were randomized. The treatment groups were 
well balanced for demographic characteristics. The actual dose of DX- 2930 administered to 
subjects ranged from 6.2 mg (in the 0.1 mg/kg group) to 300 mg (in the 3.0 mg/kg group) across 
all cohorts.
Based on the safety  anal ysis, a sin gle administration of DX -2930 was well tolerated up to doses 
of 3.0 mg/kg without evidence of dose
-limiting toxicity . There were no deaths, SAEs, or subject 
discontinuations due to adverse events (AEs) during the stud y. Furthermore, there was no 
significant imbalance between placebo and DX -2930 for any  particular treatment -emergent 
adverse event (TEAE). The most commonly  reported TEAE was headache, which occurred at a 
rate of 25% for both DX -[ADDRESS_1186546] of DX -2930 in humans. 
For additional detail regarding the single dose, clinical study  in healthy  subjects, please refer to 
the DX- 2930 Investigator’s Brochure .
1.6.2 Multiple -Ascending Dose Study in HAE Patients (DX
-2930-02)
DX-2930- 02 was a Phase 1b randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled, multiple ascending -
dose study  in patients with HAE to evaluate safet y, tolerability , and PK of SC DX -2930. 
Participating subjects were randomized 2:1 to receive either active study  drug or placebo within 
one of the following sequential, ascending dose cohorts: 30, 100, 300, or 400 mg (nominal 6 
subjects per cohort). Each subject received [ADDRESS_1186547] demographics were balanced in terms of age, race, ethnicity  and BMI . There were 
slightly  more females in the DX -2930 group than in the placebo group (66.7% versus 53.8%). 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page [ADDRESS_1186548] (30 mg) with 
injection site pain lasting [ADDRESS_1186549] (400 mg) with worsening 
headache lasting 1 minute and night sweats.
No safet y signals were identified for vital sig ns, phy sical examinations, clinical laboratory  tests, 
or electrocardiograms (ECG). Results suggested DX- [ADDRESS_1186550] -dose samples (3.3%), obtained from 2 out of 23 subjects (8.7%), were 
confirmed to be anti- drug antibod y-positive. No samples were positive for neutralizing activit y.
The pharmacokinetic analy sis for all subjects in the 30, 100, 300, and 400 mg doses showed drug 
levels in HAE subjects were dose -dependent and exhibited a prolonged half -life of 
approximately  2 weeks, ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_12340] a human monoclonal antibody . Cmaxdrug levels increased with 
increasing dose, as expected. These parameters were consistent with values obtained in health y 
subjects in Study  DX-2930 -01.
A Western blot assay  showed pre -
dose baseline levels of mean 2-chain HMWK in unactivated 
plasma collected from patients with HAE was approximately  50%. A statistically  significant 
reduction in [ADDRESS_1186551] 2 attacks in the 3 months prior to study entry  
(0.15 attacks/week). Of those subjects treated with 300 or 400 mg DX -2930, 15 of 16 subjects 
met these criteria. Of the placebo treated subjects, 11 of 13 subjects met these criteria. 
The baseline HAE attack rates (attacks/week) were 0.39 attacks per week in the placebo group, 
0.33 att acks per week in the 300 mg group, 0.55 attacks per week in the 400 mg group and 
0.49 attacks per week in the 300 and 400 mg combined group. During the pre- specified, primary  
efficacy  interval of 6 weeks (from day s 8 to 50; corresponding to a period of not able drug 
exposure), the HAE attack rate, adjusted for baseline attack rate, was 0 in the 300 mg group and 
0.045 attacks per week in the 400 mg group, compared to 0.37 attacks per week in the placebo 
group. This resulted in a 100% reduction vs placebo for the 300 mg DX -2930 group ( P< 0.0001) 
and an 88% reduction vs placebo for 400 mg DX-2930 ( P= 0.005). During this primary  efficacy  
interval, 100% of subjects in the 300 mg group ( P= 0.026) and 82% of subjects in the 400 mg 
group ( P= 0.03) were attack- free compared with 27% of subjects in the placebo group.
The data from this study  demonstrated proof of concept of the abilit y of DX- [ADDRESS_1186552] on plasma kallikrein activity  in patient plasma.

Brochure .
1.7 Rationale for Open -Label Extension Study DX-2930 -04
The open- label DX -2930 extension study  will be preceded b y the initiation of a pi[INVESTIGATOR_22735], multi -
center, double -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled parallel -arm stud y (Study DX -2930- 03) 
evaluating the efficacy  of DX -2930 in preventing acute angioedema attacks in patients with Ty pe 
I or T ype II HAE. Further information on Study  DX-2930- 03 design can be found in Appendix 
5.
Subjects who complete the Study  DX-2930- 03 treatment period will be offered the option of 
rolling into the open -label extension study , Study  DX-2930- 04.  In addition, a limited number of 
individuals with HAE Type I or Ty pe II who were not enrolled in Study  DX-2930- 03 (up to 
approximately 100) will be also enrolled. 
The rationale for this open -label extension study  is to evaluate the long -term safet y of repeated 
subcutaneous treatmen t with DX -2930 and the long -term efficacy  of DX -2930 in preventing 
HAE attacks.  For subjects rolling over from DX-
2930- 03 who were randomized to one of the 
active study  arms, the total duration of exposure across both studies will cover 36 months.  For 
rollover subjects randomized to placebo in DX- 2930 -03, and for non -rollover subjects, the total 
duration of exposure will cover 30 months.  Combined, the overall exposure between Study  
DX-
2930- 03 and Study  DX
-2930- 04 will provide a sizable dataset to evaluat e DX
-2930 as a life -
long, chronic treatment for preventing acute attacks of HAE.  
This study  seeks to evaluate the outer bounds of DX -2930 dosing frequency (possibly  beyond 
2to 4 weeks) b y assessing the duration of time between a rollover subject’s first open -label dose 
and their first reported HAE attack.  In addition, characteristics of all HAE attacks will be 
reported and compared to the subject’s historical baseline (for non -rollover subjects) or attack 
history  based on attacks reported in Study  DX-
2930 -03 (for rollover subjects).
For non -rollover subjects, the study  will evaluate the safet y and efficacy  of switching from a 
long-term prevention therapy  (eg, C1- INH, anti -fibrinoly tics, androgens) to DX -[ADDRESS_1186553] response to the pre -filled 
syringe (if available), subject response to rescue medications, subject health -related quality  of 
life (QoL), subject experience with self -administration, ease of SC administration with DX -[ADDRESS_1186554] treatment satisfaction, subjects’ and investigators’ global impression of treatment 
response, subject assessment of angioedema control, and an exit interview of subjects.

Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page [ADDRESS_1186555] ( IMP), DX- 2930, in preventing acute 
angioedema attacks in patients with Ty pe I and Type II HAE. There are two ty pes of subjects 
who will be enrolled into this study :
•Subjects who rollover from Study  DX-2930-03 
•Subjects who are non -rollover (ie, were not pa rticipants in Study  DX-
2930- 03) 
Rollover Subjects
Rollover subjects are subjects who complete the double- blind treatment period at Day  [ADDRESS_1186556] Study DX -2930- 04 visit for rollove r subjects (Day  0) 
will occur on the same day  as Study  DX-2930- 03 Day  182 study  visit. Rollover subjects will 
complete all Study  DX-2930 -03 final study  assessments (Day  182) at which time they  will be 
discharged from that study. No assessments conducted be tween Study  DX-2930- [ADDRESS_1186557] Study  DX-
2930- 04 visit (Day 0) will be duplicated.  Results of the final 
DX-

DX-2930- 04. The Sponsor may  ease this restriction based on the enrollment rate observed in 
Study  DX-2930- 03. Subjects who are still in the run -in period for Stud y DX -2930- 03 when 
enrollment for that stud y closes, as well as subjects on prior LTP who screen fail out of Study  
DX-
2930- 03 due to an inability  to wash- out of their L TP, may  screen for Study  DX-
2930-04 
following discussion with the Sponsor medical monitor.

Screening Period:
Rollover subjects
There is no screening period for rollover subjects.
Non-rollover subjects 
Non-rollover subjects must provide informed consent and have screening assessments completed 
within [ADDRESS_1186560] open -label dose.  Screened non- rollover subjects (adults and 
adolescents) who are on LTP with C1-INH therapy for HAE can continue their current LTP until 
Day 8 (or Day  15) such that subjects will have received 2 (or 4) doses of C1- INH.  For subjects 
who are on attenuated androgens (eg, danazol) or anti- fibrinoly tics (eg, tranexa mic acid); a 
similar tapering schedule is recommended. However, the taper can be prolonged b y an additional 
week, if medically indicated, as long as androgen or anti -fibrinol ytic therapy  is stopped within 
3weeks of receiving the first dose of DX -2930.  
Treatment Period:
Rollover Subjects
Following informed consent and pre -dose assessments, rollover subjects will receive a single 
open -label dose of DX -2930 administered subcutaneously  (SC) on Day  0. Subjects will not 
receive an y additional DX -[ADDRESS_1186561] adhere to the Study  Activities Schedules ( Table 1
andTable 2), for the entire duration of the stud y.  However, until a rollover subject reports their 
first HAE attack, only scheduled study visits where the fol lowing tests and assessments are 
performed must be conducted at the investigative site: pregnancy  testing, clinical laboratory  
testing, ph ysical examination, [ADDRESS_1186562] 
information on adverse events, concomitant therapy , and HAE attack data.  See Study  Activities 
Schedules ( Table 1andTable 2) for which visits must be conducted at the study  site.
Once a rollover subject reports their first HAE attack they  will present to the investigative site 
for their second open -label dose of DX -[ADDRESS_1186563] and site schedules allow.  If 
the second dose is to be administered within the accepted ± 4 day window around a scheduled 
study  visit, this treatment visit will represent that scheduled visit. If that scheduled visit has 
alread y occurred, the day of the visit will be considered an acceptable, extra study  visit.  
In the event that the second dos e is to be administered outside of the accepted ±4 day  window 
around a scheduled visit, the day of the visit will be considered an acceptable extra study  visit 
(ie, this visit will not replace an y scheduled visit). 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page [ADDRESS_1186564]’s first HAE attack occurs, there will be a minimum of 
10days between their first open -label dose and their second open -label dose. Following their 
second open- label dose, rollover subjects will continue to receive repeated SC administrations of 
open -label DX -2930 every  2 weeks for the remaining duration of the treatment per iod per the 
scheduled dosing in the Study  Activities Schedules ( Table 1and Table 2). The treatment period 
will last up to [ADDRESS_1186565]’s second 
dose, but will not exceed [ADDRESS_1186566] dose administered at the Day 910 study  visit.
All Subjects:
All doses (with the exception of the second dose for rollover subjects) require a minimum of 
10days and maximum of 18 day s between administrations, and should fall within the accepted 
±4 day  window around study  visits. 
After the second DX -2930 dose is given either within the study  window (±4 day s) or an 
acceptable extra study  visit, the 3rddose must be administered at the next pre -defined study visit 
according to the schedule of assessments.
If a subject experiences an acute angioedema attack at any  time during the study  that in the
opi[INVESTIGATOR_852717], standard of care therap y should be 
provided based on subject’s medical history  and per locall y approved product information. 
Administration of DX- 2930 and study  procedures will continue without al teration to the protocol 
Study  Activities Schedules ( Table 1and Table 2 ), even if a subject receives treatment for a 
breakthrough angioedema attack on the day of a scheduled dose of study  drug (if self -
administering) or scheduled study  visit.
Self-Adminis tration
All subjects (adolescent or adult) who are considered suitable candidates (ie, those with a 
physical and mental capability  of learning and willing to be trained) may  be allowed to self -
administer treatment. Subjects must complete appropriate traini ng by  [CONTACT_852872] b y the investigator or designee. 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page [ADDRESS_1186567]’s home or other agreed upon 
location after receiving the first 2 doses of DX -2930 at the study  site. Once initiated, subjects 
may self-administer subsequent doses of DX -2930 at the investigational site (when visits are 
scheduled stud y site visits) or the subject’s home or other agreed upon location (when the study 
permits off -site dosing). 
Adolescent subjects self -administering DX -2930 will be supervised by  a parent/legal 
guardian/caregiver. Alternatively , a parent/legal guardian/caregiver, after completing appropriate 
training, will be allowed to administer the investigational product to an adolescent without study  
site personnel supervision. 
Site personnel will call subject s within approximately  [ADDRESS_1186568] been appropriatel y documented.  Throughout the study , study  site 
personnel will document information i n source documents (ie, the subject’s medical record) and 
eCRF regarding the subject’s experience with self-administration and SC administration of 
DX-2930.
Follow -up Period
After completion of the treatment period, all subjects will undergo safet y evaluat ions during a 
4-week follow -up period.  Figure 1 shows a schematic of the open- label extension study .

Modifications to Open -Label Dosing
If, at an ytime, a dose -related safety  signal is identified either from this study  or Study
DX-2930- 03, the Sponsor may  decide to modify  the open -label DX -2930 dose and/or frequency . 
In addition, an individual subject’s dose may be modified based on a benefit -risk a ssessment and
recommendation from the treating ph ysician. Consultation with and approval by [CONTACT_1034]’s 
medical monitor is required.
In addition, based on the results of Study  DX-2930 -03, the Sponsor may  switch to a different 
dose and/or frequency .
3.1.2 Stopp ing Rules
[IP_ADDRESS] Study Level Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_852668], including SAEs and AESI, will be monitored regularl y throughout the duration of 
the study . If any  potential safet y signal is identified as a result of monitoring in this study, or 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 48
Clinical Trial Protocol Am endment 3
DX-2930- 04 29 June 2017
from an y safet y findings from Study  DX-2930- 03, or following DSMB review, the Sponsor may  
take actions as deemed appropriate, including suspending dosing in the study , while the potential 
risk is evaluated and a course of action has been determined.
[IP_ADDRESS] Individual Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_852669] y individual subject will be discontinued if the subject experiences a 
DX-2930- related SAE (or DX -2930- related, clinically  significant non -serious AE) that, in the 
assessment of the investigator or DSMB recommendation, warrants discontinuation from further 
dosing for that subject’s well- being. The investigator has the ability  to contact [CONTACT_852783]. Subjects will continue to be followed through the 
completion of all scheduled non- dosing visits, unless th ey request to be discontinued from the 
study .
3.1.3 Follow -up for Subjects Meeting Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_852722] (AE, 
laboratory , phy sical examination, vital sign, or ECG finding) will be c arefully  monitored until 
resolution, which may  include the following:
•Additional clinical laboratory  tests and/or other clinical investigations
•Additional visits or extended duration of follow -up
•Obtaining a specialist consultation
3.2 Rationale for Open -Labe l Extension Dose Selection
The dose selected for the open- label extension (300 mg every  2 weeks) is anticipated to be 
effective and safe as determined in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_22735], double- blind DX -2930- [ADDRESS_1186569] not y et completed the treatment 
period, and an y subsequent subjects, to receive a different open -label DX -2930 dose and/or

All subjects (adolescent or adult) who are considered suitable candidates (ie, those with a 
physical and mental capability  of learning and willing to be trained) may  be allowed to self -
administer treatment after completing appropriate training by  [CONTACT_852873]. Subjects are allowed to initiate self -administration at the 
subject’s home or other agreed upon location after receiving the first [ADDRESS_1186572] will be provided the 
necessary  supplies (see Section 5.7 and Section 6.15.1 ). Subjects who receive a new product 
format (ie, a single vial or a PFS) will receive a dditional training in how to self -administer with 
that format.
3.4 Study Duration for Individual Subjects
Following informed consent, subjects will either rollover from Study  DX-2930 -03 or undergo 
screening assessments (non- rollover subjects). Screening assess ments for non -rollover subjects 
must occur within [ADDRESS_1186573] 50 (to 
approximately 100) additional subjects who were not enrolled in Study  DX-2930- 03.  The total 
enrollment is expected to be at least 150, but not more than [ADDRESS_1186574]  angioedema has been reported in patients with HAE as y oung as the 
age of 3 ( Bork et al. 2003 ).In one case series of [ADDRESS_1186575]  angioedema b y the age of 18 ( Farkas 2010). An important unmet 
medical need exists among children with HAE, especiall y adolescents, since the disease 
commonly  worsens after puberty  (Bennett and Craig 2015 ; Zuraw 2008 ).  The study  will aim to 
enroll at least [ADDRESS_1186576] meet the following criteria to be enrolled in this study :
1.Male and female HAE subjects who are 12 years of age or older at the time of screening. 
2.Documented diagnosis of disease HAE (Ty pe I or II) based on all of the following:
Documented clinical history  consistent with HAE (subcutaneous or mucosal, 
nonpruritic swelling epi[INVESTIGATOR_852659]).
Diagnostic testing results obtained during screening (or a prior DX- 2930 study ) that 
confirm HAE T ype I or II: C1 inhibitor (C1 -INH) functional level < 40% of the 
normal level. Subjects with functional C1 -INH level 40- 50% of the normal level may  
be enrolled if they  also have a C4 level below the normal range.  Subjects may  be 
retested if results are incongruent with clinical history  or believed by  [CONTACT_852867] b y LTP use. (It is understood that C1 -INH therap y may alter the lab 
results of C1- INH assessments; therefore, the investigator's discr etion in collaboration 
with Medical Monitor is advised for proper documentation of eligibility ).
At least one of the following: Age at reported onset of first angioedema s ymptoms 
≤[ADDRESS_1186577] adhere to contraception 
requirements for the duration of the study  as follows:
Females* of childbearing potential must agree to be abstinent or it is recommended to use 
highl y effective forms of contraception from the screening period through 30 days after 
the final study  visit.  This includes stable doses (for 3 months prior to study  screening) of 
combined estrogen and progestin -containing hormonal contraception associated with 
inhibition of ovulation (oral, injectable or implantable), progestin -only hormonal 
contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation, intra- uterine device (IUD, all types) 
or intrauterine hormone releasing s ystems (IUS). Notes: 1) A female whose male partner 
has had a vasectom y must agree to use one additional form of medically acceptable 
contraception. 2) Use of a male condom with or without spermicide or cervical ca p, 
diaphragm or sponge with spermicide or a combination (double barrier methods) are not 
considered highl y effective.
Females of non- childbearing potential, defined as surgically  sterile (status post 
hysterectom y, bilateral oophorectom y, or bilateral tubal ligation) or post -menopausal for 
at least 12 months do not require contraception during the stud y.
Males, including males who are surgicall y sterile (post vasectom y), with female partners 
of childbearing potential must agree to be abstinent or else use a medicall y acceptable 
form of contraception from the screening period through 60 days after the final study  
visit. 
*NOTE:  Female rollover subjects (those who previously  participated in Study  DX-2930-
03) of childbearing potential may  continue to use the bi rth control method used during 
Study  DX-2930-03.
4.3 Exclusion Criteria
Subjects who meet an y of the following criteria will be excluded from the study:
1.Discontinued from Study DX -2930- 03 after enrollment for any  reason.
2.If rolling over from Study  DX-2930-03, presence of important safet y concerns that would 
preclude participation in this study .
3.Concomitant diagnosis of another form of chronic, recurrent angioedema such as acquired 
angioedema (AAE), HAE with normal C1 -INH (also known as HAE T ype III), idiopathi c 
angioedema, or recurrent angioedema associated with urticaria.

4.Dosing with an investigational drug (not including DX -2930 or other HAE therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) or 
exposure to an investigational device within 4 weeks prior screening.
5.Exposure to angiotensin -converting enzy me (ACE) inhibitors within 4 weeks prior to 
screening or an y newly initiated or dose modification of estrogen -containing medications 
with sy stemic absorption (such as oral contraceptives or hormonal replacement therapy ) 3 
months prior to the screening visit.
6.Unwilling to discontinue use of long -term proph ylactic therap y for HAE (C1 -INH, attenuated 
androgens, or anti -fibrinoly tics) within [ADDRESS_1186578] abnormalities: alanine aminotransf erase (ALT) > 3x 
upper limit of normal, or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) > 3x upper limit of normal, or 
total bilirubin > 2x upper limit of normal (unless the bilirubin elevation is a result of 
Gilbert’s Sy ndrome).
8.Pregnancy  or breastfeeding.
9. Subject ha s any condition that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_94367], may 
compromise their safety  or compliance, preclude successful conduct of the study , or interfere 
with interpretation of the results (eg, history  of substance abuse or dependence, a significant 
pre-existing illness or other major comorbidit y that the investigator considers may confound 
the interpretation of study  results).

5. STUDY TREATMENT(S)
5.1 Description of Treatment(s)
For detailed information regarding open- label DX -2930 (lanadelumab) adm inistration, refer to 
the Pharmacy  Manual.
DX-2930 is a sterile, preservative -free solution for injection, pH 6.0. The active ingredient, 
DX-2930, is formulated using the following compendial components:  30 mM sodium phosphate 
dibasic dihy drate, 19.6 mM citric acid, 50 mM histidine, 90 mM sodium chloride, 0.01% 
Polysorbate 80. Each open -label vial contains a nominal concentration of either [ADDRESS_1186579] may  receive the dose as either 2 vials 
containing 150 mg in 1 mL  each, or 1 vial containing 300 mg in 2 mL . If available, subjects may  
receive a PFS instead of vial(s). The injection will be given in the upper arm, thigh or abdomen. 
Self-Administration
All subjects (adolescent or adul t) who are considered suitable candidates (ie, those with a 
physical and mental capability  of learning and willing to be trained) may  be allowed to 
self-administer treatment after completing appropriate training b y the investigator or designee 
and demonstr ating the comprehension to self- administer. Subjects are allowed to initiate self -
administration at the subject’s home or other agreed upon location after receiving the first 2 
doses of DX -2930 at the study  site. Once initiated, subjects may  continue to se lf-administer 
subsequent doses of DX -2930 at the investigational site (when visits are scheduled study  site 
visits) or the subject’s home or other agreed upon location (when the stud y permits off -site 
dosing). See Stud y Activities Schedule ( Table 1)for de tails. Subjects who receive a new product 
format (ie, a single vial or a PFS) will receive additional training in how to self -administer with 
that format. Adolescent subjects self- administering investigational product will be supervised by  
a parent/legal g uardian/caregiver. Alternativel y, a parent/legal guardian/caregiver, after 
completing appropriate training, will be allowed to administer DX -[ADDRESS_1186580]’s medical 
record and eCRF regarding the subject’s experience with self-administration and SC 
administration of DX -[ADDRESS_1186581] dosing and follow- up are outlined in Section 3.1.1 and included in the 
Study Activities Schedules ( Table 1and Table 2) .
Rollover subjects will receive their first open label SC dose of DX -[ADDRESS_1186582] reported HAE attack.  The second dose 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 54
Clinical Trial Protocol Am endment 3
DX-2930- 04 29 June 2017
of DX -2930 may  be administered at an unscheduled visit if it is outside of the accepted ±[ADDRESS_1186583]’s first HAE attack occurs, there will be a minimum of 
10days between their first open- label dose and their second open -label dose. Following their 
second dose, rollover subjects will continue to receive repeated SC administrations of open -label 
300mg DX -[ADDRESS_1186584]’s second dose, but will not exceed [ADDRESS_1186585] from that study  and will continue to be collected through the final study  
visit. 
All information on prior and concomitant therap y (including all prescription/non -prescription 
medications, herbal med ications and vitamin supplements) must be recorded on the subject’s 
eCRF and should include the name [CONTACT_852903] (start 
and stop dates). Concomitant treatments (non
-pharmacological treatments) include any  surgical
or diagnostic procedures.
5.4.1 Allowed Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_852671] :
•Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_852672] -existing conditions, including those for acute attacks of HAE, as described 
in Section [IP_ADDRESS] are permitted if not excluded in Section 5.4.2. The use of short -term 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 55
Clinical Trial Protocol Am endment 3
DX-2930- 04 29 June 2017
prophy lactic treatment for HAE will be permitted if medically  indicated.  Short- term (pre -
procedure) proph ylaxis is defined as use of C1 -INH to avoid angioedema complications from 
medically  indicated procedures.
•Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_852729] y are permitted.
[IP_ADDRESS] Management of HAE Attacks
Acute HAE attacks during the study are to be managed in accord with the investigator’s usual 
care of their patients, including use of acute attack therapi[INVESTIGATOR_852718]. Use of C1- INH will be permitted as an acute attack therap y but not as a 
LTP therap y. Administration of DX -[ADDRESS_1186586] has s ymptoms of an HAE attack the 
day of DX -2930 administration and/or receives treatment for an HAE attack. The administration 
of DX -2930 can also be re -scheduled as long as the minimum and maximum timeframe between 
doses are met based on patient preference or ph ysician discretion.
5.4.2 Excluded Concomitant Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_852674] y:
•Long -term prophy laxis for HAE (eg, use of C1- INH for LTP, attenuated androgens, or 
anti-fibrinoly tics) once LTP is discontinued (within [ADDRESS_1186587] dose of 
DX-2930).
•Angiotensin- converting enzy me (ACE) inhibitors.
•Initiating or changing the dose of estrogen -containing medications with sy stemic absorption 
(such as oral contraceptives or hormonal replacement therapy ) 3 months prior to the 
screening visit.
•Use of androgens (eg, stanozolol, danazol, oxandrolone, methy ltestosterone, testosterone) for 
non-HAE related medical conditions or for HAE after discontinuation during the first 
3weeks.
•Any othe r investigational drug or device.
5.[ADDRESS_1186588]’s home or other agreed upon 
location after receiving the first 2 doses of DX -2930 at the study  site. Once initiated, subjects 
may continue to self -administer subsequent doses of DX -2930 at the investigational site (when 
visits are scheduled study  site visits) or the subject’s home or other agreed up on location (when 
the study  permits offsite dosing). Site personnel will call subject s within approximately  [ADDRESS_1186589] been appropriately  documented. 
See Study  Activities Schedules ( Table 1and Table 2) for details. For all subjects, subsequent 
doses after the second dose require a minimum of 10 day s and maximum of 18 day s between 
administrations, and should fall within the accepted ±4 day  window around study  visits. 
For rollover subjects, after the second DX -2930 dose is given either within the study  window 
(±4days) or an acceptable extra study  visit, the 3rddose must be administered at the next pre -
defined stud y visit according to the schedule of assessments.
5.7 Packaging and Labeling
The open- label DX -2930 will be supplied by  [CONTACT_852874] a study  kit for 
investigational studies. Each study  kit will contain 1 vial (or pre -filled s yringe, if available) of 
investigational product. Both the vials and carton (kit) will be appropriately labeled according to 
local regulations and bear the unique study drug kit number. The investigative site will provide 
ancillary  supplies including s yringes, ne edles, and alcohol wipes to subjects. The site has the 
option of using needles of a different gauge to aid subject comfort with each SC injection. 
Subjects who elect to self -administer investigational product will be provided the following 
supplies as appl icable:
•1 to 2 dose(s) supply  of investigational product
•Ancillary  supplies, including s yringes, needles, alcohol pads, a temperature monitoring 
device, and a container for sharps disposal
•Subject accountability form to record investigational product storage conditions and 
administration details
All used and unused vials should be returned to the study  kit cartons/boxes and transported to the 
site for drug accountability .  Written instructions on DX -[ADDRESS_1186590] be stored at 2ºC to 8ºC/36ºF

6.3 Demographics and Medical History 
Demographics: date of birth (alternately  age or year of birth, if full date is not allowed to be 
collected for legal reasons), sex, race , and ethnicity  (where locall y permitted) and medical 
history  will be obtained at Screening from subjects not rolling over from Study  DX-2930- [ADDRESS_1186596]’s 
current medica l status (current disease processes), past medical status (past disease processes), 
history  of surgery , allergies and concomitant medications. For subjects rolling over from Study  
DX-2930- 03, these data will be carried forward from that study . 
6.4 HAE Attack Information Collection
The collection, reporting, and assessment of attacks in this study  will be done in accordance with 
the HAE Attack Assessment and Reporting Procedures (HAARP).  Study  site personnel will be 
trained on HAARP prior to screening and enro lling subjects at their site.
Study  site personnel will train subjects and caregivers on identifying s ymptoms of an attack, the 
requirements for reporting attacks and the information they  will be expected to provide.  The 
subject (and caregiver) will confi rm their understanding of what is required of them for reporting 
attacks to the site.
At screening, HAE attack history  will be collected for non- rollover subjects. I nformation 
collected will include any prior history  of lary ngeal attacks, attack frequency ,average severit y, 
predominant attack location(s), triggers, average duration, acute attack therapy use and history  of 
LTP (including duration of L TP, medication(s) and dose used for LTP, and frequency  of attacks

while receiving LTP).  If available, information will also be collected on HAE diagnosis (y ear of 
confirmation, how man y years after onset of s ymptoms was diagnosis confirmed, or if subject 
was misdiagnosed).
During the study , subjects (or caregivers) will be instructed to notify  and report details to the 
study  site within [ADDRESS_1186597] in tracking any HAE attacks experienced, but their use is 
not mandatory . 
Subjects (or ca regivers) will be asked to provide the following information when reporting an 
attack:
•Date and time s ymptoms of an attack were first experienced
•Description of s ymptoms experienced, including location(s)
•Impact on activit y (work, school, social interactio ns) and whether an y assistance or medical 
intervention was required, including hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], additional laboratory  tests, or 
emergency  department visits
•Any medications used to treat the attack (both prescription and over the counter)
•If the attack res olved, date and time the subject was no longer experiencing sy mptoms
Study  site personnel will review the information provided and solicit additional information as 
necessary  to document the attack, as described in HAARP.
Study  site personnel will contact [CONTACT_852737]  7days following the first 
dose of open-
label until the subject has received their second open label dose.  This is to ensure 
accurate reporting for any  HAE attacks not already  reported by  [CONTACT_852841] 
72hours.  During each study  visit, study  site personnel will solicit for any  new HAE attack 
information that was not alread y provided to the site.
In this stud y, HAE attacks will be captured as AEs. All AEs, regardless of seriousness, severity , 
or cau sal relationship to DX -2930, will be recorded on the AE page of the eCRF. Any AE 
reported to the site meeting criteria for a serious adverse event must be reported to the Sponsor 
using the SAE Reporting Form in the EDC s ystemwithin [ADDRESS_1186598] -reported and investigator/ ph ysician designee -confirmed

Despi[INVESTIGATOR_852664] s ymptoms, the investigator or phy sician designee may still 
clinically  determine that the event did not represent an attack if there are features that strongl y 
refute such a diagnosis. For example, the reported event is accompa nied b y symptoms that are 
not consistent with an HAE attack (eg, urticaria), the reported event persists well bey ond the 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_852665], or there is a likely  alternate etiology  for the event (eg, the 
subject’s abdominal s ymptoms are a ttributable to a viral gastroenteritis outbreak in the 
household).

and Table 2) unless the subject has elected to self- administer off -site for that visit. Routine vital 
sign assessments will be taken with the subject in the sitting or supi[INVESTIGATOR_55848] [ADDRESS_1186601] and will include body  temperature, heart rate (HR), blood pre ssure (BP) and respi[INVESTIGATOR_2842] 
(RR). BP should be determined using the same arm and the same equipment for each assessment.  
For subjects who rollover from Study  DX-2930- 03, vital signs taken during the final study  visit 
in Study  DX-2930-03 will serve as the Day  0 pre -dose vital signs in this study  and will not be 
duplicated.  
6.6 Physical Examination
A phy sical examination including height, weight, and calculation of Body  Mass I ndex (BMI) 
will be performed b y the investigator or his/her qualified designee ac cording to the Study  
Activities Schedules ( Table 1and Table 2 ). The phy sical examination will be performed in 
accordance with standards at the site. 
For subjects who rollover from Study  DX-2930 -03, the phy sical exam taken during the final 
study  visit in Study  DX-2930 -03  will serve as the Day  0 pre -dose ph ysical exam in this study

reading vendor for assessment or will be assessed on site. For su bjects who rollover from Study  
DX-2930- 03, the ECG taken during the final study  visit in Study  DX-2930- 03 will serve as the 
Day 0 pre -dose ECG in this study  and will not be duplicated.
6.8 Clinical Laboratory Tests
6.8.1 Laboratory Parameters
Laboratory  testing will be performed according to the Study  Activities Schedules ( Table 1and 
Table 2). 
Laboratory  testing includes general safety  parameters (hematology , coagulation, urinaly sis, and 
serum chemistry ), pregnancy  tests (in females of childbearing potential), PK s ampling, PD 
sampling, plasma anti- drug antibody  testing, and biomarker testing. All laboratory  tests will be 
performed using established and validated methods. 
When multiple sample collection ty pes are performed at the same assessment time point, the 
samples will be drawn in the following order (depending on what sample ty pes are to be 
collected at that time point): laboratory  safet y samples (hematology, coagulation, serum 
chemistry ), C1 -INH, C4, C1q, PK, anti- drug antibodies, PD, and biomarker samples. Aliquots 
from the samples may  be retained as back -up for additional parameter testing if necessary .

6.14 Quality of Life Assessments
Quality  of life ( QoL) assessments will be conducted using the Angioedema Quality  of Life 
Questionnaire ( AE-QoL), EuroQoL 5- Dimensional 5 -Level Measure (EQ -5D-5L), Work 
Productivity  and Activit y Impairment Questionnaire: General Health (WPAI -GH), Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_710196] (HADS), and 12 Item Short Form Survey  (SF-12).See Study  
Activities Schedules ( Table 1and Table 2 ). For subjects who rollover from Study  DX-2930-03, 
quality  of life asse ssments obtained during the final study  visit in Study  DX-2930- 03 will serve 
as the Day  0 pre -dose quality  of life assessments in this study  and will not be duplicated.
6.14.1 Angioedema Quality of Life Questionnaire (AE- QoL)
The AE- QoL is a self -administered, symptom -specific tool developed and validated to assess 
quality  of life (QoL) impairment in patients with recurrent angioedema ( Weller et al. 2012 ). The 
AE-QoL consists of 17 questions covering 
four domains/dimensions (functioning, fatigue/mood, 
fear/shame, nutrition). Each of the 17 items has a five -point L ikert-type response scale ranging 
from 1 (Never) to 5 (Very Often). The AE -QoL is scored to produce a score for each domain and 
a total score ranging from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating stronger impairment. I t takes 5 
minutes to complete the AE -QoL.
6.14.2 EuroQoL 5 -Dimensional 5- Level Measure (EQ -5D- 5L)
The EQ -5D- 5L is a self -administered standardized measure of health status comprised of a 
descriptive s ystem and a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). The descriptive s ystem consists of five 
health related quality  of life dimensions (ie, mobility , self -care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, 
and anxiety /depression). Each dimension is rated on a 5 -
point response scale (5 levels) indicating 
severit y of problems, where 1 is “no problems” and 5 is “extreme problems”. The EQ -5D VAS is 
a measure of overall self -rated health status on a 20 -cm vertical VAS with endpoints labelled 
“the best health you can imag ine” and “the worst health y ou can imagine”. The VAS ranges from 
0 to 100, with higher scores indicative of better overall health.
6.14.3 Work Productivity and Activity Impairment – General Health (WPAI- GH) 
Questionnaire
The WPAI -GH is a 6- item instrument assessi ng work and activity  impairment due to health 
problems during the past 7 day s. The instrument elicits four main scores in relation to general 
health specifically : absenteeism (the percentage of work time missed because of one's health in 
the past seven day s), presenteeism (the percentage of impairment experienced while at work in 
the past seven day s because of one's health), overall work productivity  loss (an overall 
impairment estimate that is a combination of absenteeism and presenteeism), and activity  
impairment (the percentage of impairment in daily activities because of one's health in the past 
seven day s) (Reilly et al. 1993 ). Adolescent subjects should complete the WPAI  questionnaire 
and use the term “school” instead of “work” when filling out this questionnaire.  These data will 
be anal yzed separatel y.

6.14.4 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5620] (HADS)
The Hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_74017] (HADS) is a self-assessment scale to detect states of 
depression, anxiety , and emotional distress amongst patients who were being treated for a variet y 
of clinical problems ( Zigmond and Snaith 1983). The scale has a total of 14 items. Seven of the 
items relate to anxiety  and seven relate to depression.  The responses are scored on a scale of 0 –3 
(3 indicates higher s ymptom frequencies). Scores for each subscale (anxiety and depression) 
range from 0 to 21 with scores categorized as follows: normal 0–7, mild 8 –
10, moderate 11 –14, 
and severe 15–21. Scores for the entire scale (emotional distress) range from [ADDRESS_1186605] 
week.
6.14.5 12 Item Short Form v2 Health Survey (SF -12v2)
The SF -12v2 Health Survey  is a reliable and valid generic measure of functional health and well -
being. The SF -12v2 consists of 12 questions, all selected from the SF -36 Health Survey  (Ware et 
al. 1996 ). The SF -12v2 yields eight health domains (vitality , phy sical functioning, bodily  pain, 
general health percep tions, phy sical role functioning, emotional role functioning, and mental 
health summary  measures. Phy sical and Mental Health Composite Scores (PCS & MCS) can be 
computed using the scores of twelve questions and range from [ADDRESS_1186606] (AE CT)
The Angioedema Control Test (AECT) is a patient reported outcome measure. The concept of 
the AECT is comparable to those of the well-established Asthma Control Test (ACT) and 
Urticaria Control Test (UCT) ( Nathan et al. 2004 ; Weller et al. 2014 ). The AECT could be used 
to assess control of angioedema among pa tients with recurrent angioedema (including hereditary  
angioedema) and to aid treatment decisions. The AECT consists of up to 10 questions. Each 
question has 5 answer options (verbal rating scale) that are scored from [ADDRESS_1186607] score.
6.14.7 Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM-9)
The TSQM -9 is a validated 9
-item questionnaire developed to measure subjects’ satisfaction 
with their medication and includes three scale scores: effectiveness, convenien ce, and global 
satisfaction ( Bharmal et al. 2009 ). Scale scores for each of the 3 scales, as well as a combined 
score are ca lculated separatel y. Scores are transformed to a 0 to 100 scale, where higher scores 
indicate greater treatment satisfaction. The TSQM -9 has been applied in clinical studies in 
several chronic conditions.
6.14.8 Global Impression of Treatment Response
The subjects’ and investigators’ global impression of treatment response will be assessed using a 
one-item question. The item will assess overall perception of treatment response. Assessment 
will be performed separately  by [CONTACT_224092]. The subjects and investigators will 
be asked to think of “today ” while rating the question (or an appropriate translation, as

of DX -2930 at the study  site (administered by  [CONTACT_24355]). 
For those subjects who choose to self- administer or have a parent/legal guardian/caregiver 
administer DX -2930, subjects must complete an assessment of thei r experience with self -
administration and subcutaneous injection for each dose received. Study personnel will 
document the subject’s responses in the subjects’ medical record and eCRF.
6.15.2 DX-2930 Self -administration and Subcutaneous Injection Survey
Subjects will complete an assessment on their overall experience with self -administration and 
experience with receiving SC injections of DX -2930 according to the Study  Activities Schedules 
(Table 1and Table 2)during the study . Subjects who received a PFS will be asked to describe 
the overall experience using the PFS including aspects of administration. For subjects who have 
previously  received LTP with C1 -INH products via IV administration, they will be asked to 
indicate the preferred route for medication administ ration. Study  personnel will document the 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page [ADDRESS_1186610]’s responses in the subjects’ medical record and eCRF. In addition, investigators will be 
asked to indicate their preference (SC, IV, or no preference) on the route to administer 
medications to prevent angio edema attacks.

6.16.1 Definitions
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event
An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a clinical trial subject whether or not it appe ars to 
have a causal relationship with the treatment administered. 
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory  
finding), s ymptom, or disease temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal product or 
participation in a clinical study , whether or not directly  related to the medicinal product or study  
participation.
•AEs may be new events or may  be pre -existing conditions that have become aggravated or 
have worsened in severity or frequency  during the course of the stud y.
•AEs may  be clinicall y significant changes from baseline in physical examination, laboratory  
tests, or other diagnostic investigation (eg, laboratory  results, x -ray findings).
Laboratory  abnormalities generall y are not considered AEs unless th ey are associated with 
clinical signs or s ymptoms, or require medical intervention. A clinicall y significant laboratory 
abnormality  that is independent from a known underly ing medical condition and that requires 
medical or surgical intervention, or leads to DX -[ADDRESS_1186612] or are part 
of a known underly ing medical condition are not, in themselves, AEs; rather, the underl ying 
medical cond ition leading to the abnormalities would be reported as the AE.
Pregnancy  is not an AE; however, if a female subject becomes pregnant during the conduct of 
the study , the investigator must notify  the Sponsor according to the procedures provided in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS].
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious Adverse Event
A SAE is any  adverse experience occurring at any dose that results in any  of the following 
outcomes:
•Death
•Life-threatening experience; Note: “Life -threatening” refers to a situation in which the 
subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that might 
have caused death if it were more severe.
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 69

DX-2930- 04 29 June 2017
•Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]; Note: Does not 
include hospi[INVESTIGATOR_852730] e within 24 hours. A scheduled 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a pre-existing condition that has not worsened during participation in the 
study  does not meet this criterion. Pre -planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_852677]/surgical procedure or routine check -ups d o not meet this criterion.
•Results in persistent or significant disability  or incapacit y.
•Is a congenital anomal y or birth defect.
•Is considered to be an important medical event defined as those that may  not be immediately  
life-threatening or result in dea th or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may  jeopardize the subject or may  
require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition above.
[IP_ADDRESS] Overdose
An overdose is defined as a significant variation from the recommended/scheduled dosage for a 
product. The dosing for this study  will be conducted in a controlled clinical setting and an 
overdose is not anticipated. However, in the event of an accident, for this study , an overdose of

[IP_ADDRESS] Planned Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]
A hospi[INVESTIGATOR_852678]- label DX -[ADDRESS_1186614]’s medical history  is considered complete. However, if the event/condition worsens 
during the trial, it must be reported as an AE.
[IP_ADDRESS] Treatment -Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE)
An AE is treatment -emergent if the onset time is after first administration of open- label DX -[ADDRESS_1186615]’s participation in Study  
DX-
2930-[ADDRESS_1186616] open- label dose in Study  DX-
2930- 04, and then subse quently  reappeared in Study  DX-2930-04 will be counted as a new 
TEAE in Study  DX-2930

[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI)
Adverse events of special interest (AESI) will be captured and monitored during this study . 
Investigators will report all AE SI to the Sponsor, regardless of causality , using the same 
timelines as described for SAE reporting. The following describe the AESI and the criteria for 
reporting AESI.

events are considered AESI  for this study . Investigators will report all diagnoses, or signs and 
symptoms when diagnoses cannot be determined, that are consistent with hy persensitivity  
reactions, regardless of causality , within 24 hours from the time of study  drug administration. 
Investigators will report hy persensitivity  reactions that occur after 24 hours, only ifthe reactions 
are suspected to be related to study  drug.
EVENTS OF DISORDERED COAGULATION
Bleeding AESI
Although aPTT prolongation due to plasma kallikrein inhibition is an artifactual in vitro
phenomenon, as a precautionary  measure in evaluating the safet y of DX- 2930, bleeding events 
will be reported as AESI for this study . Investigators will report all diagnos es, or signs and 
symptoms when diagnoses cannot be determined, that are consistent with a clinical event of 
bleeding. Coagulation testing (aPTT, PT, INR) should be performed when possible, and when 
temporally  reasonable, with any  reports of bleeding or for clinical conditions possibly  indicative 
of bleeding.
Hypercoagulable AESI
Investigators will report all diagnoses, or signs and sy mptoms when diagnoses cannot be 
determined, that are consistent with a thrombotic or embolic etiology . 
6.16.2 Monitoring
[IP_ADDRESS] Monitoring of Adverse Events
Each subject will be monitored for the occurrence of AEs, including SAEs and AESI, from 
signing of the ICF through the final follow- up visit.
•Subjects will be questioned and/or examined b y the investigator or a qualified designee for 
evidence of AEs. The questioning of subjects with regard to the possible occurrence of AEs 
will be generalized such as, "How have you been feeling since your last visit?”  The presence 
or absence of specific AEs should not be elicited from subjects.
•Subjec ts having TEAEs will be monitored until resolution with relevant clinical assessments 
and laboratory  tests, as determined by  [CONTACT_093].
•AEs, actions taken as a result of AEs, and follow -up results must be recorded in the eCRF as 
well as in the subje ct's source documentation. Follow -up laboratory  results should be filed 
with the subject's source documentation.
For an y SAEs or AEs that require the subject to be discontinued from dosing, relevant clinical 
assessments and laboratory  tests will be repeat ed as clinically  appropriate, until final resolution 
or stabilization of the event(s). Subjects will continue to be followed through completion of all 
scheduled visits.

[IP_ADDRESS] Monitoring of Safety Laboratory Assessments
All safet y laboratory  assessments will be performed at a central laboratory . The clinical 
laboratory  values will be reported to the investigator who will review them for clinical 
significance and consideration of abnormal values as potential AEs.
6.16.3 Assessment of Adverse Events
[IP_ADDRESS] Assessment of Severity
The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity  (severit y) of a specific event (as in mild, 
moderate, or severe m yocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may  be of relatively  minor 
medical signifi cance (such as severe nausea). This is not the same as “serious,” which is based 
on subject/event outcome or action criteria usuall y associated with events that pose a threat to a 
subject’s life or functioning.
In this stud y, the severity of AEs will be as sessed according to Division of Microbiology  and 
Infectious Diseases (DMID) Adult Toxicity  Table, Draft, November 2007 (US National 
Institutes of Health: National I nstitute of Allergy  and Infectious Diseases) ( Appendix 1 , 
Appen dix 2 ) and the Division of Microbiology  and I nfectious Diseases (DMID) Pediatric 
Toxicity  Table, Draft, November 2007 (US National I nstitutes of Health: National Institute of 
Allergy  and Infectious Diseases) ( Appendix 3 ). For a bnormalities not specifically  found in the 
Toxicity  Tables, the following general scale will be used to estimate grade of severit y:
•GRADE 1 (Mild): Transient or mild discomfort; no medical intervention/therap y required

All HAE attacks will be captured as AEs and assessed with DMID & HAE Attack Assessment 
and Reporting Procedures (HAARP) criteria.
[IP_ADDRESS] Assessment of Causality
A medicall y qualified investigator must assess the relationship of an y AE (including SAEs) to 
the use of DX -2930, as related or not related, based on clinical judgment and using all available 
information, and may  include consideration of the following factors:
•Possible alternative causes of the AE, including the disease under treatment, pre -existing 
conditions, concomitant use of other drugs, and presence of environmental or genetic factors.
•The temporal association between DX -2930 exposure and onset of th e AE.
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 72
Clinical Trial Protocol Am endment 3
DX-2930- 04 29 June 2017
•Whether the manifestations of the AE are co nsistent with known actions or toxicity  of 
DX-2930.
•The AE resolved or improved with decreasing the dose or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_852681] -2930 
(dechallenge). Judgment should be used if multiple products are discontinued at the same 
time.
The causal relationship betw een DX- 2930 and the AE will be assessed using one of the 
following categories:
Not Related:   Factors consistent with an assessment of Not Related include:
Temporal relationship is lacking (eg, the event did not occur within a reasonable 
time frame following administration of DX -2930); or
Other causative factors more likely  explain the event (eg, a pre -existing condition, 
other concomitant treatments).
Related:   Factors consistent with an assessment of Related include:
There is a positive temporal re lationship (eg, the event occurred within a 
reasonable time frame following administration of DX -2930); or
The AE is more likel y explained by [CONTACT_852747] -2930 than b y another 
cause (ie, the AE shows a pattern consistent with previous knowledge of 
DX-2930 or the class of DX -2930).
[IP_ADDRESS] Assessment of Clinical Significance
Clinical significance of individual AEs will be determined b y the investigator, with discussion 
with the Medical Monitor as appropriate.
6.16.4 Clinical Laboratory Adverse Events
Laboratory  abnormalities generall y are not considered AEs unless they are associated with 
clinical signs or s ymptoms, or require medical intervention. A clinicall y significant laboratory 
abnormality  that is independent from a known underlying medical condition and that requires 
medical or surgical intervention, or leads to DX
-2930 interruption or discontinuation, will be 
considered an AE.
When laboratory  abnormalities are considered to be AEs, the DMID Adult Toxicity  Table 
(Appendix 2 ) or DMI D Pediatric Toxicity  Tables ( Appendix 3 ) will be used to assess severit y. 
Where discrepancies in the upper limit of normal (ULN) and lower limit of normal (LLN) of 
laboratory  ranges occur between those included in the DMID tables and those of the laborator y 
that performs the assay s, the values provided by  [CONTACT_852845] y grade. Clinical significance of individual laboratory  AEs will be determined by  [CONTACT_852793]. 
Following is an exception to defining clinically  significant, abnormal laboratory values as AEs:
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 73
Clinical Trial Protocol Am endment 3
DX-2930- 04 29 June 2017
APTT prolongation in the absence of an y associated bleeding or other evidence of clinical 
relevance will not be considered a clinically  significant laboratory  abnor mality  or AE. In the 
appropriate ph ysiologic setting, such as IV heparin therapy , aPTT can be used to monitor 
bleeding risk. However, as noted in the Investigators Brochure, aPTT prolongation due to 
plasma kallikrein inhibition is an artifactual in vitro phenomenon. Although plasma kallikrein 
drives fibrin formation in the aPTT assay , plasma kallikrein -driven coagulation does not 
appear to have hemostatic or other ph ysiologically  important functions in vivo . It is well 
documented that, in humans, deficiency of factor XII or prekallikrein (and thus plasma 
kallikrein) is not associated with abnormal bleeding, either spontaneous or during surgical 
procedures ( Renne and Gruber 2012 ). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_852682], deficiency  of either 
protein is associated with marked prolongation of the aPTT. 
6.16.5 Reporting Inv estigator Safety Observations to the Sponsor
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting Non -serious Adverse Events
All AEs, regardless of seriousness, severit y, or causal relationship to DX -2930, will be recorded 
on the AE page of the eCRF. In this study  all HAE attacks reported b y the su bject, regardless of 
whether or not they  are confirmed by  [CONTACT_093], will be captured as AEs.
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting Pregnancies
If a female subject or the female partner of a male subject becomes pregnant during the course of 
the study , the investigator must report the pregnancy  to the Sponsor’s Pharmacovigilance 
Department using the Pregnancy  Reporting Form within [ADDRESS_1186618] pregnancy  information (including the 
status of the newborn, if applicable).
If some of the information required for completion of the Pregnancy  Reporting Form is 
unavailable at the time of the initial report, follow-up reports will be completed and submitted 
within 24 hours of becoming aware of the new information. The investigator is required to 
follow the pregnancy  through delivery . The outcome of the pregnancy  and the status of the 
newborn (if applicable) will be reported on the Pregnancy  Reporting Form within 24 hours of 
becoming aware.

percentage of censored observations. Plots of the Kaplan -Meier curves and supporting data 
listings detailing each subject’s contribution to the anal ysis will be provided. 
Formal h ypothesis testing will not be performed.  Any hypothesis testing will be exploratory  in 
nature and resulting p -values will be considered descriptive.
9.2 Samp le Size Determination
No formal sample size calculation was performed.  The sample size is not based on an y 
statistical considerations.  This study  is designed to evaluate the safet y and efficacy  of open- label 
treatment with DX -2930 in subjects who participated in Study  DX-2930- 03  (rollover subjects) 
and individuals who were not otherwise able to participate in Study  DX-2930 -03  (non- rollover 
subjects).
9.3 Method of Assigning Study Subjects to Treatment
Subjects meeting all eligibility  criteria will be enrolled in the study and sequentially  assigned a 
unique site -based identification number.
9.4 Analysis Populations
9.4.1 Safety Population
The Safet y Population will include all subjects who received an y stud y drug after entering Study 
DX-2930- 04 (ie, any  exposure to open- label DX -2930). Unless otherwise specified, summary  
tabulations conducted with the Safety  Population will be presented by  [CONTACT_423]’s study  entry  
type (rollover or non -rollover) and overall.
9.4.2 Rollover Safety Population

time of the first open -label dose of DX -[ADDRESS_1186688] investigator- confirmed HAE 
attack, including but not limited to: baseline attack rate prior to entering Study  DX-2930- 03, the 
treatment group in Study  DX-
2930- 03, the time since the last dose given in Study  DX-2930-03, 
the time since the la st HAE attack, and the rate of attacks during Study  DX-
2930- 03. Results of 
this exploratory  anal ysis will be summarized.  
9.6.2 Number of Investigator- confirmed HAE Attacks
The number of investigator- confirmed HAE attacks during the treatment period (Day  0 through 
Day 924) expressed as a monthly  HAE attack rate, will be anal yzed using each analy sis 
population.
The treatment period investigator -
confirmed HAE attack rate will be calculated for each subject 
as the number of investigator- confirmed HAE attacks oc curring during the treatment period 
divided by  [CONTACT_28991] s the subject contributed to the treatment period multiplied by  
28days.  
The baseline investigator -confirmed HAE attack rate will be calculated for each subject as the 
number of investigator -confirmed HAE attacks occurring during the pretreatment period for 
rollover subjects or historical reporting period for non- rollover subjects divided by  [CONTACT_852880] -rollovers multiplied by  [ADDRESS_1186689].
In addition, the number of investigator -confirmed HAE attacks per month (defined as 28 day s) 
will be summarized descriptively  by [CONTACT_24473] (per 28 day  interval) for each analy
sis population. 
The summary  will include the number, change from baseline, and percent change from baseline 
of investigator -confirmed HAE attacks. Investigator -confirmed HAE attacks will be grouped into 
28-day intervals using the start date of the HAE attack . The date of the first exposure to study  
drug in this study  will be used as the start of the first interval and end of the interval will be the 
date of first exposure to study  drug in this study  plus [ADDRESS_1186690] d ay of the prior interval plus 1 day  and end 28 day s later.

exposure to open -label DX -2930 in this study , or medical conditions present prior to the start of 
treatment but increasing in severity or relationship at the time of or following the start of 
treatment. For AEs with partial onset times, non- missing date parts will be used to determine if 
the AE is treatment- emergent or not.  If a determination cannot be made using the non -missing 
date parts as to when the AE occurred relative to study  drug administration, then the AE will be 
classified as treatment -emergent.
The anal yses described in this section will be based on treatment- emergent AEs; plainly  referred 
to as AEs in this section for brevit y.  
Related AEs are AEs classified as related to stud y drug b y the investigator.  Severe AEs are AEs 
classified as severe (grade 3) or life threatening (grade 4) b y the investigator.
For this anal ysis, AEs will be classified to one of two anal ysis periods:
•Treatment Period AEs will include all AEs starting at or after the first exposure to open -label 
DX-[ADDRESS_1186692]’s last visit date during the 
treatment period in this study  (AEs starting at or after treatment on Day  0 to the Day  924 
visit). 
•Follow -up Period AEs will include all AEs starting at or after the subject’s last visit date of 
the treatment period in this study  (AEs starting after the Day  924 visit).

DISEASES (DMID) ADULT TOXICITY TABLE  
NOVEMBER 2007  
DRAFT  
 
Note:   The following toxicity table is  a DRAFT and designed to provide general guidance 
on parameters  for monitoring safety in clinical trials.   This toxicity table is not  comprehensive and 
should not be applie d directly  to all trials.    
  
When selecting a toxicity table, the following are some of the items that must be taken into 
consideration:  
  
• The population being studied  
o Does the clinical trial evaluate healthy subjects , subject s with a particular disease 
or condition?  
• The stage of test article development  
o Is the clinical tr ial a Phase I, II, III or IV?  
• The type of  test article   
o Does the clinical trial evaluate a drug,  device,  vaccine or  other biologic agent?  
• The prior human and preclinical experience with the test article  
o Are there any specific findings that require adjustment of  the toxicity table?  
  
Single site clinical trials evaluating healthy subjects s hould conform to the laboratory normal 
values  at the single site. Multi -center clinical trials should reconcile among their laboratory normal 
values when evaluating a healthy volunteer population.  
  
Please confer with the DMID protocol team and DMID's Office of Clinical Research Affairs  when 
selecting or developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a toxicity table for a DMID -sponsored trial.

ESTIMATING SEVERITY GRAD E  
For abnormalities NOT found elsewhere in the Toxicity Tables use the scale below to estimate grade of severity:  
GRADE 1  Mild    Transient or mild discomfort  
 (< 48 hours); no m edical intervention/therapy required  
GRADE 2  Moderate   Mild to moderate limitation in 
activity - some assistance may be needed; no or minimal 
medical intervention/therapy required  
GRADE 3  Sever e    Marked limitation in activity, some 
assistance usually requ ired; medical intervention/therapy 
required, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_281925] 4  Life-threatening  Extreme limitation in activity, 
significant assistance required; significant medical intervention/therapy required, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_281926] -THREATENING AEs  
 
ANY clinical event deemed by [CONTACT_135956] -threatening should be 
considered a grade  4 event.  Clinical events considered to be serious or life -threatening 
include, but are not limited to:  seizures, coma , tetany, diabetic ketoacidosis, 
disseminated intravascular coagulation, diffuse petechiae, paralysis, acute psychosis, 
severe depression.  
 
COMMENTS REGARDING THE USE OF THESE TAB LES  
 
• Standardized and commonly used toxicity tables (Division of AIDS, NCI’ s 
Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC), and World Health Organization (WHO)) have 
been adapted for use by [CONTACT_71513] 
(DMID) and modified to better meet the needs of participants in DMID trials.  
 
•  For parameters not included in the following Toxicity Tables, sites should refer to 
the “Guide For Estimating Severity Grade”  located above.  
 • 
Criteria are generally grouped by [CONTACT_6764].  
 
• Some protocols may have additional protocol specific grading criteria, which will supercede the use of these tables for specified criteria.

DIVISION OF MICROBIOLOGY AND INFECTIOUS 
DISEASES (DMID) PEDIATRIC  TOXICIT Y TABLES  
NOVEMBER  2007 
DRAFT  
  
 
Note:   The following toxicity table is  a DRAFT and designed to provide general guidance 
on parameters  for monitoring safety in clinical trials.   This toxicity table is not  comprehensive and should 
not be applie d directly  to all trials.    
  
When selecting a toxicity table, the following are some of the items that must be taken into consideration:  
  
• The population being studied  
o Does the clinical trial evaluate healthy subjects , subject s with a particular disease or 
condition?  
• The stage of test article dev elopment  
o Is the clinical tr ial a Phase I  (is it for the fisrt time in human subjects?) , II, III or IV?  
• The type of  test article   
o Does the clinical trial evaluate a drug,  device,  vaccine or  other biologic agent?  
• The prior human and preclinical experience with the  test article  
o Are there any specific findings that require adjustment of  the toxicity table?  
o Has it been approved for this indication in adult population?  
  
Single site clinical trials evaluating healthy subjects s hould conform to the laboratory normal values  at the 
single site. Multi -center clinical trials should reconcile among their laboratory normal values when 
evaluating a healthy volunteer population.  
  
Please confer with the DMID protocol team and DMID's Office of Clinical Research Affairs  when selecting 
or developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a toxicity table for a DMID -sponsored trial.

ESTIMATING SEVERITY GRAD E  
For abnormalities NOT found elsewhere in the Toxicity Tables use the scale below to estimate 
grade of severity:  
GRADE 1  Mild    Transient or mild discomfort  
 (< 48 hours); no medical intervention/therapy required  
GRADE 2  Moderate   Mild to moderate limitation in activity - 
some assistance may be needed; no or minimal medical intervention/therapy required

assistance  required; significant medical intervention/therapy 
required, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_852704] 5                              Death  
 
SERIOUS OR LIFE- THREATENING AEs  
 
ANY clinical event deemed by [CONTACT_135956] -threatening  should be 
considered a grade  4 event.  Clinical events considered to be serious or life -threatening include, 
but are not limited to:  seizures, coma, tetany, diabetic ketoacidosis, disseminated intravascular 
coagulation, diffuse petechiae, paralysis, acut e psychosis, severe depression.  
 
COMMENTS REGARDING THE USE OF THESE TAB LES  
 
• Standardized and commonly used toxicity tables (Division of AIDS, NCI’s Common 
Toxicity Criteria (CTC), and World Health Organization (WHO)) have been adapted for use by [CONTACT_852812] d Infectiou s Di seases (DMID) an d m odified to 
better meet the needs of participants in DMID trials.  
 •  
For parameters not included in the following Toxicity Tables, sites should refer to the “Guide For Estimating Severity Grade”  located above.  
 • 
Criteria are generally grouped by [CONTACT_6764].  
 
• Some protocols may have additional protocol specific grading criteria, which will 
supercede the use of these tables for specified criteria.  Shire CONFIDENTIAL

•Peripheral angioed ema: cutan eous s welling invol ving an ext remity, the fa ce, neck, to rso,

•Abdomin al angioed ema: a bdomin al pain, with or without abdomin al dist ention, naus ea,

•Laryngea l angioedema: stridor, dyspnea, di fficulty speaking, di fficulty s wallowing, throat 
tightening, or
swelling of the ton gue, palate, uvula, or larynx
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_852732], the investigatorm aystill d etermine c linically tha t 
theevent did not re prese nt an HAE a tt ack if thereare features that strongly refute sucha 
diagnosis. For
example, the reported eve nt is accomp anied by s ymptoms th at arenot 
consist ent with an attack (e.g., ur tic
aria), the reported eve nt persists well beyond the typi [INVESTIGATOR_852733] a ttack (e.g., g reat erthan 7 days), or thereis alikely a lternateetiology for 
theevent (e.g., the subject’s abdomin al symptoms are attributabletoa viral gastroent eritis 
outbreak in the household).
To be counted as a unique
attack distin ct from th ei r previous attack, the new s ymptoms must 
occur a t least 24 hour s after resolution of thepriorattac k’s symptoms.
Attack re solution is def i
ned a s the subject no lo nger having sy mptoms of theattack.

APPENDIX 5 Summary of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_852691] -2930- 03 in Subjects with HAE
The proposed pi[INVESTIGATOR_306339]  (Study  DX-2930 -03) is entitled “HELP Study®: A 
Multicenter, Randomized, Double- Blind, Placebo- Controlled Efficacy  and Safety  Study  to 
Evaluate DX -[ADDRESS_1186825] Acute Attacks of Hereditary  
Angioedema (HAE).” This study  will be a multi -center, double- blind, rando mized, placebo -
controlled parallel -arm study  evaluating the efficacy  of DX -2930 in preventing acute 
angioedema attacks in patients with Ty pe I or Ty pe II HAE. The double -blind study  is planned to 
be followed b y the stud y described in the present protocol, an open -label extension (OLE) study  
(DX-2930- 04).
The primary  objective of Study  DX-2930- 03 is to evaluate the efficacy  of DX -2930 in 
preventing HAE attacks. The secondary  objective is to evaluate the safet y of repeated SC 
administrations of DX
-2930. The t ertiary  objectives are to evaluate the pharmacody namic effects 
of chronically  administered DX -2930; to assess the immunogenicit y of chronically administered 
DX-2930; to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of chronically  administered DX -2930; and to 
evaluate the effect of DX- [ADDRESS_1186826] 4 weeks. HAE subjects 
will then be randomized 2:1 to receive repeated subcutaneous (SC) administrations of DX -2930 
or plac ebo in a double -blind fashion.  Subjects who are randomized to DX -2930 will be assigned 
in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of three dose regimens: [ADDRESS_1186827] dose on Day  0 through Day  
182.
Subjects may  consent to rollover into the OLE study  (present protocol DX -2930- 04) upon 
completion of their participation in the double -blind treatment period.
The primary  endpoint will be to compare the number of investigator- confirmed HAE attacks 
observed in each DX -2930 treatment arm to that in the placebo arm during the efficacy  
assessment period (Day  0 through Day  182).

Dose Rationale for Double -Blind, Pi[INVESTIGATOR_852686]-2930-03
The dose rationale is based on the pharmacod ynamic bioactivity , PK, safety , and efficacy  of DX -
2930 from the Phase 1 clinical studies and nonclinical studies. Together, these attributes provide 
the rationale for the selected doses and regimens to achieve drug levels likely  to prevent a 
majority  of HAE atta cks. Based on these considerations, 300 mg every  2 weeks, 300 mg every  
4weeks, and 150 mg every  4 weeks were identified as the dosing regimens for evaluation,
The 3 proposed dose -regimen combinations provide a 6 -fold range of steady -state trough 
concentra tions and leverage both the biomarker and efficacy  data generated in Study  
DX-2930-
02.  Evaluation of the DX- 2930 plasma concentrations at the time of attacks reported 
by [CONTACT_304727]-2930 treated subjects in DX -2930- 02 suggests that the 3 planned dosing regimens wi ll 
provide a meaningful range of clinical response while avoiding non -therapeutic or super -
therapeutic doses and regimens.

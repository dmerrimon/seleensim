Study Phase:  2/3 
Study Sites:  Approximate total:  71 
[LOCATION_002]: 42 
  
  
 
Indication:  Cervical dystonia  
Rationale:  Cervical dystonia (spasmodic torticollis) is the most common form of 
focal dystonia, affecting the neck and shoulder muscles. Cervical 
dystonia is characterized by [CONTACT_508405] . It is often associa ted with 
neck and shoulder pain.  
Botulinum toxin A is considered first -line therapy for cervical 
dystonia, helpi[INVESTIGATOR_508401], posture, and disability. ABP -450 
(prabotulinumtoxinA)  is a toxin produced by [CONTACT_78622] . 
It blocks neuromuscular transmission by [CONTACT_508406], entering the nerve terminals, and inhibiting 
the release of acetylcholine. Blocking the release of acetylcholine 
plays a role in relaxing muscles by [CONTACT_508407].

PrabotulinumtoxinA  has also been found to be non-inferior to BOTOX® for the treatment of 
moderate to severe glabellar lines in adult patients and upper limb spas ticity in patients with 
stroke ( Nam 2015 , Rzany 2019 ). The doses of ABP -450 used in the Phase  3 study for upper 
limb spasticity were similar to the doses of BOTOX® used (no significant differences were 
seen between the 2  groups) ( Nam 2015 ). 
ABP -1900 0 is an ongoing , Phase 2, randomized, double -blind , mult icenter,

Protocol: ABP -[ZIP_CODE] (Version 2. 1) [ADDRESS_656561] of the Study During the COVID -19 Pandemic  
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID -19) is a viral illness caused by [CONTACT_508409][INVESTIGATOR_7686] -related coronavirus 2 (SARS -CoV-2) and has impacted most of the 
countries across the globe. It was declared as a global public health emergency by [CONTACT_508410] [ADDRESS_656562] of clinical trials of medical products in various ways . 
The safety and well -being of patients and site staff is  of paramount  importance during the 
COVID -19 pandemic . Measures will be implemented during the study to reduce t he chance 
that study drug  will be administered to patients who are infected with SARS -CoV-2. 
Testing for COVID -19 will be performed as required by [CONTACT_508411]  [INVESTIGATOR_508403] . If a patient  tests po sitive, study visits  
related to retreatment  will be delayed until patient recovers . The investigator will provide the 
patients  with guidance of further clinical care for their SARS -CoV-2 infection. If the result is 
indeterminate, the PCR testing may need to be repeated  as per institutional standards . 
Other potential measures will be taken to assure the safety and welfare of patie nts, 
maintaining compliance with GCP, and minimizing risks to trial integrity during the 
COVID -19 pandemic, such as tele visits . Any other potential measures or changes will be 
handled according to the regulations . 
Any event s of COVID -19, including asympto matic and symptomatic SARS -CoV-2 infection 
(i.e., COVID -19), are to be reported as AEs per Section  6.2.1 .  
 
 
All the measures taken in relation to COVID -19 will be reported to the regul atory authorities 
as appropriate.

Patients who meet all eligibility criteria will contin ue the current OLE study with the 
randomization code assigned by [CONTACT_508412] -[ZIP_CODE] 
 stud ies as their study number. All eligible patients who had their initial dose of 
study drug in the ABP -[ZIP_CODE]  stud ies, irrespective of treatment allocation, and 
who consented to being treated for cervical dystonia ,  
 will 
receive ABP -450 in an  unblinded fashion . 
5.2 Treatment Administered  
Investigational s tudy drug is a Clostridium botulinum  toxin type A. Each vial will contain 
100 units of lyophilized ABP -450. 
The ABP -450 dose to be administered to patients in the ABP -[ZIP_CODE] OLE study will range 
between 1 50 and 350 units. Patients will be enrolled in the ABP -[ZIP_CODE] OLE study with the 
opportunity to either maintain or modify  the dose at the  investigator’s discretion . As the blind 
will not be broken, the placebo patients (who were entered into one of the dose groups in the

[IP_ADDRESS]  Definitions of Adverse Events  
The investigator is responsible for reporting all AEs that are observed or reported during the 
study, regardless of their relationship to investigational  study drug. The investigator will 
query the patient for changes since last visit and ask about the pat ient’s ability to swallow.  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient enrolled into this study 
regardless of its causal relationship to investigational  study drug. Patients will be instructed 
to contact [CONTACT_508414].  
A treatment -emergent AE is defined as any event not present before exposure to 
investigational  study drug or any event already present that worsens in either intensity or 
frequency after exposure to investigational  study drug.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Serious Adverse Events  
An SAE is defined as any event that  
• results in death  
• is immediately life -threatening  
• requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Eliciting and Documenting Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be assessed from the time the patient signs the ICF until exit from the 
study (ie, 52 weeks or end of treatment [ ET] after Day 0 “rollover”).

Protocol: ABP -[ZIP_CODE] (Version 2. 1) 13 May 2021 
 
 Page 44 Serious AEs that occur more than 56 days (ie, 8 weeks) after the last dose of investigational  
study drug and the patient has exited the study need not be reported unless the investigator 
considers them related to investigational  study drug.  
At every study visit, patients will be asked a standard non -leading question to elicit any 
medically related changes in the ir well -being. They will also be asked if they have been 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], had any accidents, used any new medications, or changed concomitant 
medication regimens (both prescription and over -the-counter medications).  
In addition to patient observations, AEs id entified from any study data (eg, laboratory values, 
physical examination findings, changes in 12 -lead ECG results ) or identified from review of 
other documents that are relevant to patient safety will be documented on the AE page in the 
eCRF.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reporting Ad verse Events  
All AEs reported or observed during the study will be recorded on the AE page in the eCRF. 
Information to be collected includes the following:  
• Drug treatment  
• Dose 
• Event term  
• Time of onset  
• Investigator -specified assessment of severity and relationship to investigational  study 
drug 
• Time of resolution of the event  
• Seriousness  
• Any required treatment or evaluations  
• Outcome  
Adverse events resulting from concurrent illnesses, reactions to concurren t illnesses, 
reactions to concurrent medications, or progression of disease states must also be reported. 
All AEs will be followed to adequate resolution. The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA) will be used to code all AEs.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Assessment of Severity  
The severity, or intensity, of an AE refers to the extent to which an AE affects the patient’s 
daily activities. The intensity of the AE will be rated as mild, moderate, or severe using the 
following criteria:  
Mild : An event usually transient in nature and generally not interfering with normal 
activities.  
Moderate : An AE that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal activities.  
Severe : An AE that is incapacitating and prevents normal activities.  
Changes in the severity of an AE should be documented to allow an assessment of the 
duration of the event at each level of intensity to be performed. A Es characterized as 
intermittent do not require documenta tion of onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Assessment of Causality  
The investigator’s assessment of an AE’s relationship to investigational  study drug is part of 
the documentation process, but it is not a factor in determining what is or is not reported i n 
the study. If there is any doubt as to whether a clinical observation is an AE, the event should 
be reported.  
The relationship or association of the test article in causing or contributing to the AE will be 
characterized using the following classificatio n and criteria:  
Unrelated : This relationship suggests that there is no association between investigational  
study drug and the reported event.  
Possible : This relationship suggests that treatment with investigational  study drug 
caused or contributed to the AE, ie, the event follows a reasonable temporal 
sequence from the time of drug administration or follows a known response 
pattern to investigational  study drug but could also have been produced by 
[CONTACT_1604].  

Aeon Biopharma, Inc.  ABP -450 
Protocol: ABP -[ZIP_CODE] (Version 2. 1) 13 May 2021 
 
 Page 47 Unrelated : This relationship suggests that there is no association between investigational  
study drug and the reported event.  
Probable : This relationship suggests that a reasonable temporal sequence of the event 
with drug administration exists and, based upon the known pharmacological 
action of the drug, known or previously reported adverse reactions to the drug 
or class of drugs, o r judgment based on the investigator’s clinical experience, 
the association of the event with investigational  study drug seems likely. The 
event disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction of the dose of 
investigational  study drug.  
Definite : This re lationship suggests that a definite causal relationship exists between 
drug administration and the AE, and other conditions (concurrent illness, 
progression or expression of disease state, or concurrent medication reaction) 
do not appear to explain the eve nt. The event reappears or worsens if the 
investigational  study drug is re -administered.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Follow -Up of Patients Reporting Adverse Events  
All AEs must be reported in detail on the appropriate page in the eCRF and followed to 
satisfactory resolution, until t he investigator deems the event to be chronic or not clinically 
significant, or until the patient is considered to be stable.

Protocol: ABP -[ZIP_CODE] (Version 2. 1) [ADDRESS_656568] used 
the TWSTRS scale as the primary efficacy measure ( Fernandez 2013 ; Espay 2018 ). The 
standard TWSTRS is a comprehensive scale that comprises three  subsets to assess motor 
severity, pain, and disability ( Comella 2016 ). The motor severity subscale consists of 
10 items, with variable scaling and weighting. It also includes a disability subscale with 
7 items, and a pain scale with 3  items. The total score is the sum of each of the subscales.

 Page 49 6.3.2 PGI-C and CGI -C Scales  
The PGI -C enables the patient to rate change s in their perception of their general health 
status over the duration of the assessment via a 7 -point scale ranging from “very much 
improved” to “very much worse” ( Fischer 1999 ). For this study, a 5-point generic PGI -C 
scale ranging from “ much better ” to “ much worse ” was used (FDA 2018 ). Similarly, the 
CGI-C is a 7 -point scale ranging from “very much improved” to “very much worse” 
(Guy 1976 ) based on the physici an’s perception of the patient’s health status. Detailed 
description s of the PGI-C and CGI -C are provided in Appendix  13.4 and Appendix  0, 
respectively.  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
6.3.4 C-SSRS  
The C -SSRS was developed by [CONTACT_34033] 2012 for measuring suicidal ideation and 
behavior in clinical trials ( Posner 2011 ). The C -SSRS was designed to distinguish the 
domains of suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior. Four constructs are measured. The first is 
the severity of ideation (hereafter referred to  as the “severity subscale”), which is rated on a 
5-point ordinal scale in which 1=wish to be dead, 2=non -specific active suicidal thoughts, 
3=suicidal thoughts with methods, 4=suicidal intent, and 5=suicidal intent with plan. The 
second is the intensity o f ideation subscale (hereafter referred to as the “intensity subscale”), 
which comprises five items, each rated on a 5 -point ordinal scale: frequency, duration, 
controllability, deterrents, and reason for ideation. The third is the “behavior subscale,” 
which is rated on a nominal scale that includes actual, aborted, and interrupted attempts; 
preparatory behavior; and non -suicidal self -injurious behavior. The fourth is the “lethality 
subscale,” which assesses actual attempts; actual lethality is rated on a 6 -point ordinal scale,

Protocol: ABP -[ZIP_CODE] (Version 2. 1) 13 May 2021 
 
 Page 50 and if actual lethality is zero, potential lethality of attempts is rated on a 3 -point ordinal scale 
(Posner 2011 ). A detailed description is provided in Appendix  13.7.

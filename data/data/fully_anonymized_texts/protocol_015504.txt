Chung  |  VR Tech Detailed Protocol Version 2 – September 1, 2020  2    I. Background and Significance In the [LOCATION_002] today only a small fraction of colonoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_66905].1 However, sedation is not routine across the globe, even among other developed countries. A recent study of colonoscopy practice in Italy reported that 45% of patients go without sedation.1 This number soars to 75% in Portugal and 82% in China.1 The use or lack of sedation does not alter the risks associated with the procedure; medication is only a matter of preference and comfort.  Further research shows that time to reach the cecum is comparable in sedated and un-sedated patients, and discharge time is significantly shorter for un-sedated patients.[ADDRESS_73159] non-pharmacological methods of pain management that would confer the benefits of an un-sedated procedure, and possibly reduce patient pain perception and discomfort. One such method is the use of virtual reality (VR). This technology immerses the user in a virtual environment, and has been shown to have analgesic effects on patients undergoing procedures such as dental work and surgery done under local anesthesia.[ADDRESS_73160] towards pain.  
Chung  |  VR Tech Detailed Protocol Version 2 – September 1, [ADDRESS_73161] Selection Inclusion criteria: Participants will be routine colonoscopy patients ages [ADDRESS_73162] had a prior colonoscopy. Subjects of any race and gender will be recruited. Exclusion criteria: Patients who are scheduled for monitored anesthesia care or general anesthesia will be excluded. Children (under 18 years) will be excluded because pediatric endoscopy patients receive general anesthesia at [LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. First-time colonoscopy patients are excluded from the population to avoid the additional anxiety often experienced by [CONTACT_66914]. Virtual reality distraction depends largely upon the user allowing him/herself to turn attention to the virtual experiences and away from real experiences. Stressful situations, such as being in an unfamiliar medical environment awaiting an invasive procedure, activate the sympathetic nervous system. Sympathetic activation leads to hypervigilance – an active opponent of any distraction method. This pi[INVESTIGATOR_66906], and allow us to determine whether the distraction method may be strong enough to reasonably offer it to first-time colonoscopy patients in future research.  All participants must be willing and able to provide written informed consent.  IV. Subject Enrollment Adult patients (over the age of 18) who have a scheduled screening or surveillance colonoscopy and have undergone at least one prior colonoscopy will be eligible for recruitment. The electronic medical record of the potential subject may be reviewed prior to contact[CONTACT_66915]. Once a potential subject is identified, the patient will be sent a mailing which will outline the study, and request the opportunity for the research coordinator to contact [CONTACT_66916]. This letter will provide the phone number of the research coordinator, and patients will be asked to contact [CONTACT_66917]. If the patient has not contact[CONTACT_66918], the coordinator will contact [CONTACT_66919]. A disclaimer on the letter will be included stating this. If the subject declines to take part in the 
Chung  |  VR Tech Detailed Protocol Version 2 – September 1, 2020  4  study, his/her name [CONTACT_66927][CONTACT_66920]. Recruitment group: Patient contacts research coordinator regarding study via phone If the patient calls the research coordinator after receiving the letter in the mail, the coordinator will explain the study using a call script. Recruitment group: Patient does not contact [CONTACT_66921], the coordinator will contact [CONTACT_12552]/her by [CONTACT_66922]. One phone call attempt will be made; if there is no response, the patient will not be contact[CONTACT_23322]. All participants will be required to sign the written informed consent form on the day of the procedure. The consent form will be pre-mailed to participants at their request. Patient recruitment targets: This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_66907] a virtual reality approach to pain management. We aim to recruit [ADDRESS_73163] at his/her colonoscopy appointment. The research coordinator will review the study procedures, answer any remaining questions, and obtain written informed consent using the written informed consent form. The subject will then be prepped for his/her colonoscopy by a registered nurse, and standard colonoscopy consent including consent to pharmacological sedation will be obtained by [CONTACT_66923][INVESTIGATOR_541].  Once inside the procedure room, the research coordinator will fit the consented participant with a virtual reality head-mounted display (HMD), and set up virtual experiences for the patient to go through during their procedure through a control tablet. The HMD will completely obscure the patient’s sight of the real room. The virtual environment will be enhanced with sound effects from the HMD, but the participant will still be able to hear the sounds of the procedure room so that they may respond to the verbal requests of their clinicians. The colonoscopy will proceed according to standard practice using virtual reality instead of chemical analgesics for as long as the participant chooses. Should a participant who consented to drug administration prior to the procedure request pain medication, the research coordinator will remove the HMD and a registered nurse will administer the appropriate medications, following the standard of care at MGH. 
Chung  |  VR Tech Detailed Protocol Version 2 – September 1, [ADDRESS_73164] will also complete a brief questionnaire about his/her experience working with the patient using virtual reality distraction. The HMD will be cleaned in between each use. A Hyperkin sanitary mask will cover all parts of the HMD that contact [CONTACT_28024]. This mask will be removed, discarded, and replaced with a new one in between each use. The entire HMD will also be wiped with a sanitary wipe before and after every use. Remuneration: Participants will receive a free 4-hour parking pass at [LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_66908]. Otherwise, expenses will be incurred by [CONTACT_66924]/or his/her insurance carrier as usual for the scheduled screening or surveillance colonoscopy. Costs: Subjects will not be charged for any examination or procedure done solely for the purposes of this study. Subjects and/or their insurers will be responsible for procedures and tests performed as a part of routine clinical care. All virtual reality hardware and software will be provided by [CONTACT_66925], Inc. They are donating their equipment to us free-of-charge for the purposes of this study. A zero-dollar purchase order and gift agreement are attached to the IRB application with details of this donation.  VI. Risks and Discomforts It is unknown the extent to which virtual reality may ease pain and discomfort during colonoscopy. It is possible that the virtual reality technology used in this study will not sufficiently reduce pain and discomfort. If a subject experiences a level of pain or discomfort s/he would like pain medication for, s/he has only to verbalize the request for pain medication and it will be administered. This could result in the first part of the colonoscopy being more uncomfortable than it might have been, had the subject not participated in the study.  VII. Potential Benefits Subjects may or may not benefit from participating in this study. Should a subject complete his/her colonoscopy without pain medication, possible benefits may include shorter recovery time and lack of impairment for the rest of the day. The results of this research will help us understand alternative methods of managing pain without the use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438].

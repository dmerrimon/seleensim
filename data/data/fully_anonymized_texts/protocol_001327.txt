Version 6/5/[ADDRESS_865406]
Rationale:  Men who have sex with men (MSM) continue to be disproportionately 
affected by [CONTACT_10840]. The majority of HIV infections among MSM occur through exposure to 
the rectal mucosa during condomless receptive anal intercourse (CRAI). To aid in 
prevention, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) are 
recommended for MSM who may be exposed to HIV. Current recommendations for 
PrEP are to take the combination anti-HIV drug, tenofovir+emtricibatine (TDF/FTC), on 
a daily basis for the duration of someone’s HIV risk exposure period, which could be 
months or years. For PEP, a three-drug anti-HIV medication is recommended within [ADDRESS_865407] 
participants from HIV or treat any active infection.  
Design: To address the absorption and persistence of anti-retroviral drugs by [CONTACT_646355], investigators at Emory University will collaborate with the Center for 
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to conduct a clinical trial of up to 56 MSM aged 
18-49 with measurement of anti-retroviral drug concentrations in various body 
compartment sites of possible HIV exposure. We plan to enroll men who are HIV 
negative that engage in receptive anal intercourse (RAI) and are not currently (or have 
no current plans) taking PEP or pre- exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). We will enroll 
participants in one of 3 study arms where they will be given 2 doses of the oral fixed 
dose combination anti-HIV medication Biktarvy (TAF/FTC/BIC) separated by 24 hours. 
Depending on study arm (A, B, C), participants will undergo body compartment 
sampling at different time points including, blood, urine, optional semen, oral swabs, 
penile swabs, and rectal biopsy collections. 
Participants will undergo rectal biopsy collection at [ADDRESS_865408] study visit, eligibility will be determined 
and screening blood work (approximately 15 mL), including a rapid HIV test, will be 
performed. At the second study visit, participants will be provided two doses 
TAF/FTC/BIC. The first does will be observed in clinic. They will be instructed to take 
the second dose at home with documentation by [CONTACT_443773], time-stamped photo or video.

Version 6/5/2020 5Depending on which study arm the participant is sequentially assigned to, the 
participant will be asked to return to the Hope Clinic at different time points to complete 
the remaining visits (visits 3, 4, 5). During visits 3-5, all participants will undergo blood 
collection (approximately 2 tablespoons of blood will be obtained), an oral cheek swab, 
urethral swab, 1 pre- wet and 1 dry penile swabs, and a urine sample will be collected. 
Each participant will also undergo a single time-point (depending on study arm 
assignment—either visit 3 or 4 or 5) rectal secretion collection with swabs and wicks, a 
swab for rectal STI testing, and a rectal biopsy via rigid sigmoidoscopy. All participants 
will have urine tested for STIs from one time point. All participants will be asked to 
abstain from receptive anal intercourse for 7 days after biopsy procedures to allow the 
mucosa to heal. 
Participants will also be asked to provide an optional single semen specimen on the day 
of rectal sampling to further evaluate drug levels.  All biologic specimens will be 
transferred to CDC within 4 hours of collection for measurement of antiretroviral drug 
levels.  
Participants may participate in more than one study arm or subgroup; however, at least 
[ADDRESS_865409] to repeat the 
screening visit (visit 1) when starting another arm; they will begin the new arm at visit 2.
Duration: The duration of this study is 2 years. Participants will be considered ‘on-
study’ for no more than 12 weeks.  
Sample size: For this protocol we will recruit 56 HIV-negative MSM (age 18- 49) who 
meet eligibility criteria outlined in the protocol.  
Population:  The population to be studied in this protocol are healthy HIV negative 
MSM who are engaging in receptive anal intercourse (RAI) and are willing to perform 
study procedures. We will recruit participants through existing research databases at 
the Hope Clinic and the Rollins School of Public Health, through internet and paper 
advertisements, and community venues as is currently the process for [CONTACT_26019]’s 
ongoing research protocols.
LAY SUMMARY:
 
Men who have sex with men (MSM) continue to be disproportionately affected by [CONTACT_10840]. 
In 2014, MSM made up approximately 2% of the U.S. population but accounted for 70% 
of the new HIV infections (CDC)( 2). The majority of MSM acquire HIV after exposure to 
the rectal mucosa through receptive anal intercourse without condoms. Pre-exposure 
prophylaxis (PrEP) and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) are recommended for MSM

Version 6/5/2020 6who may be exposed to HIV to prevent infection. Current recommendations for PrEP 
are to take the combination anti-HIV drug, tenofovir+emtricibatine (TDF/FTC), on a daily 
basis for the duration of someone’s HIV risk exposure period, which could be months or 
years. For PEP, a three-drug anti-HIV medication is recommended within [ADDRESS_865410] study visit and undergo a screening medical history, and safety 
laboratory tests. A physical exam may also be completed. At the beginning of the study, 
all participants will take 2 doses of the anti-HIV regimen 
tenofovir+emtricitabine+bictegrativir (TAF/FTC/BIC). At subsequent study visits (visit 
times defined by [CONTACT_760]), participants will return to donate blood, oral swabs, 
penile swabs, and urine. At one study visit (visit defined by [CONTACT_760]), participants 
will undergo a rectal biopsy procedure and provide a semen specimen. All biologic 
specimens collected will be transferred to CDC on the day of collection for 
measurement of drug levels.   
PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Public Health Relevance: Information about new anti-HIV agents and how they are 
absorbed by [CONTACT_646356].
Goal: To assess the pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution of anti-HIV drugs after 
taking 2 doses of TAF/FTC/BIC.

Version 6/5/2020 20Biologic specimens:
Biologic specimens collected after the screening visit will be transferred directly to CDC 
for measurement of study drug levels.  Specimens will be labeled with a unique ID that 
only the Emory study team will be able to link to identifiable information. CDC personnel 
will not have access to identifiable information.   
Contingency visit:
Attempts to ensure adherence to the study visits will be made with telephone and/or 
email reminders to the participant.  However, if for example, screening laboratory results 
are lost or are inconclusive or if a participant has been unable to adhere to study 
protocol, he may be rescheduled for a future date where the above visit procedures will 
be performed.  These additional visits will be scheduled within the above visit windows.  
Timing of procedures after dose:
The procedures conducted after dose, particularly those less than 24 hours after dose, 
should occur as close to the scheduled time points as possible. Protocol deviations will 
be filed for visits that occur outside of the target windows identified above only if the visit 
is conducted more than 3 hours beyond the target window defined above for each arm 
and visit. 
Phone calls/retention contacts:
While on study, periodic phone calls, texts, or email reminders will occur between study 
staff and participants to ensure proper retention and adherence to study protocol.  
Rectal biopsy procedures
All biopsies will be completed by [CONTACT_21114] [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a delegated, licensed medical 
professional whom the PI [INVESTIGATOR_443762]. Rectal biopsies utilizing a 
disposable rigid sigmoidoscope, light source, and jumbo biopsy forceps. [CONTACT_26019] was 
trained in office based rectal biopsy procedures by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Robin Rutherford, an (now 
retired) experienced gastroenterologist at Emory University. All biopsy procedures will 
be performed in an examination room at the Hope Clinic with assistance from the 
project coordinator or clinical research nurse. Similar procedures have been performed 
in [CONTACT_26019]’s research protocols >300 times with no complications. Briefly, without the 
administration of any previous enemas or other preparation, up to 10 adequate ~1.[ADDRESS_865452]: ART Persistence

subjects who donated rectal biopsy samples and inquire about symptoms, 
complications, or adverse events related to study procedures. Subjects who report 
symptoms suggestive of any significant complications will receive advice on seeking 
care and will be given referrals to appropriate healthcare professionals as needed. This 
follow-up may be completed over the phone or through electronic communication.
Optional semen collection:
After participants have taken study dose in clinic, they will be instructed to obtain semen 
sample 2hrs before or after the scheduled rectal biopsy visit. The semen will be 
collected by [CONTACT_443793] a provided collection cup and will be stored 
on ice until it is brought to the clinic. Participant will be provided towelettes for cleaning 
the head of the penis before masturbation is started.  The sample should be collected 
no more than [ADDRESS_865454] 48 hours prior to semen collection. If these 
instructions are not followed, a notation will be made and the semen sample will still be 
accepted. 
Statistical analysis plan
Median (range) drug levels (TAF and FTC and BIC) will be calculated at baseline, 
twenty four hours after the first dose, and [ADDRESS_865455] dose for plasma, PBMCs, 
and, rectal tissues.  Differences in median drug levels between baseline and study visit 
follow-up visits will be analyzed with non-parametric Wilcoxon-signed rank tests.  A p-
value of <0.05 will be considered significant. 
Future use of specimens
Additional biologic specimens not used for above drug level testing may be used and/or 
stored for future research use at Emory University Hope Clinic or the CDC. 
RISKS AND HOW MINIMIZED
HIV risk counseling
Participants that are tested for HIV to ensure eligibility will undergo HIV risk reduction 
counseling (e.g. increasing condom use, reducing number of partners, addressing 
substance abuse, etc.) by [CONTACT_9154] [INVESTIGATOR_646350]. HIV rapid testing will then be conducted 
with a CLIA waived product with finger-stick or whole blood from phlebotomy, 
depending on the test. Any participant who is found to be HIV positive on rapid testing 
TITLE OF PROJECT: ART Persistence 
Emory IRB protocol
PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: [INVESTIGATOR_443754] F. Kelley, MD, MPH
Version 6/5/[ADDRESS_865456] any HIV positive participant in accessing healthcare for HIV infection as needed. 
Participants will also be educated about HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis during the study 
by [CONTACT_270804]/or study clinician. After completion of the study, all men who are 
interested in PrEP for HIV prevention will be linked to community services. A detailed 
listing of PrEP services available for insured and uninsured clients in Atlanta can be 
found at www.preplocator.org. [CONTACT_26019] is active in PrEP implementation in the Atlanta 
community and can facilitate these linkages.   
Blood sample collection
The most common risks of blood sample collection are pain at the puncture site, 
bruising, and a feeling of lightheadedness. To minimize these risks, blood draws will be 
performed by [CONTACT_21724], and will be performed in a secure environment with 
access to first aid equipment, bandages, and trained healthcare professionals. 
Risk of TAF/FTC/BIC
TAF/FTC/BIC is a combination anti-HIV medication that contains the drugs tenofovir 
alafenamide, emtricitabine, and bictegravir. Based on clinical trials previously conducted 
of TAF/FTC/BIC, the drug showed to be well tolerated (see package insert). The most 
common adverse events reported in clinical trials (> 5% incidence) included diarrhea, 
nausea, and headache. Additional adverse reactions occurring in less than 2% of 
subjects administered TAF/FTC/BIC included vomiting, flatulence, dyspepsia, 
abdominal pain, rash, and depression. 
Renal toxicity and bone density loss are rarely reported with chronic use of TAF 
containing products and are not expected to occur with the two-dose regimen 
prescribed in this protocol. Similarly, lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly have 
rarely been associated with medications in the same class as TAF and FTC; however, 
are not expected to occur with this two-dose regimen.  
Use of TAF/FTC can also cause flare-ups in those who have hepatitis B virus.  It can 
cause the Hepatitis B virus to suddenly return in a worse form than before if treatment 
was provided (see package insert). For this reason, it is important that participants not 
participate in the study if they are known to have Hepatitis B. Nonetheless, the 
maximum 2-day dosing regimen for this study is unlikely to cause flare-ups in Hepatitis 
B even if not diagnosed.   
Acquisition of HIV drug resistance is a theoretic concern for HIV positive people taking 
intermittent dosing of anti-HIV medication. For this protocol, we will test participants for 
HIV at study entry and monitor clinically for high-risk behavior or any signs of acute HIV 
infection at study visits.  If high-risk behavior (e.g. unprotected anal intercourse with a 
TITLE OF PROJECT: ART Persistence 
Emory IRB protocol
PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: [INVESTIGATOR_443754] F. Kelley, MD, MPH
Version 6/5/2020 23man of unknown HIV status) or symptoms of acute HIV infection are reported, and HIV 
antibody test will be repeated and the participant will be counseled about the need for 
any follow-up testing.  Clinical signs and symptoms of acute HIV infection that will be 
queried include: fever, fatigue, malaise, skin rash, swollen glands, oral/genital ulcers, 
myalgia/arthralgia( 3).  [CONTACT_26019] will review all reports of clinical signs/symptoms to 
determine appropriate follow-up and linkage to care as necessary.  If a diagnosis of 
acute HIV infection is thought to be possible or determined by [CONTACT_443794], the 
participant will be discontinued from the study. For this protocol, we will test participants 
for HIV at study entry and monitor clinically for high-risk behavior or any signs of acute 
HIV infection at study visits. 
Participants will be asked to abstain from receptive anal intercourse for three days prior 
to drug dosing and during the study protocol in order to limit additional exposures (e.g. 
semen, douching, additional lubricants) to the rectal mucosa. Participants taking 
TAF/FTC/BIC will be counseled that they should not expect to achieve protection from 
HIV infection by [CONTACT_646363], as they will be provided a limited supply. 
All participants included in the study that have an interest in taking PrEP for HIV 
prevention, will be referred to an area PrEP provider at the termination of the study. The 
Hope Clinic has compi[INVESTIGATOR_42602] a resource sheet of area providers that will be distributed to 
interested participants.  
Rigid sigmoidoscopy and biopsies
Risks associated with lower gastrointestinal endoscopy include colitis from chemicals 
for endoscope sterilization, bowel perforation, bleeding, diverticulitis, and infection. All 
procedures will be performed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Kelley or a nurse practitioner trained by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Kelley. 
Non-physician medical providers have performed endoscopic procedures for diagnostic 
and therapeutic procedures for years. Many of these require mastery of flexible 
sigmoidoscopes, detailed anatomy of the full colon, and familiarity with sedation 
procedures.( 4, 5) Procedures utilizing flexible instruments that access a deeper area of 
the colon and may or may not require sedation are more complicated and risky than the 
procedure detailed in this protocol which utilizes a rigid sigmoidoscope and only 
accesses the sigmoid colon a maximum of [ADDRESS_865457]. 
Kelley’s team has performed >300 similar procedures for other IRB approved protocols 
with zero complications.  
All procedures will utilize disposable rigid sigmoidoscopes, forceps, and guides to 
reduce risk of infection and obviate the need for instrument sterilization between 
participants.  To minimize risks, rigid proctoscopy, rather than flexible sigmoidoscopy or 
full colonoscopy, will be used in this study and the number of biopsies taken will be 
limited to 10.  Colonoscopy has been shown to be associated with a still low, but 
significantly greater risk of complications than rectosigmoidoscopy.( 6)  The frequency of 
serious complications after flexible sigmoidoscopy is extremely low and complications 
TITLE OF PROJECT: ART Persistence 
Emory IRB protocol
PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: [INVESTIGATOR_443754] F. Kelley, MD, MPH
Version 6/5/2020 24from rigid sigmoidoscopy are presumably even lower, but unknown.  In two large 
studies including a combined 144,832 clinically indicated procedures, the incidence of 
serious complications ranged from 0.06 to 0.8% utilizing flexible sigmoidoscopy.( 6, 7) 
Obtaining biopsies may be associated with an increased risk of complications. The best 
available data on the risk of multiple biopsies comes from studies of dysplasia 
surveillance among patients with long-standing inflammatory bowel disease, in whom 
large numbers of “blind” biopsies are obtained throughout the colon for early detection 
of malignant transformation. In two such studies including a combined 3,011 procedures 
and a median of eight and 17 biopsies, respectively, there was only one serious 
complication, for an incidence of approximately 0.33%.( 8, 9) In a study of subjects 
undergoing endoscopic procedures exclusively for research purposes, including 64 
flexible sigmoidoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_15128] a mean of 25 biopsies obtained from the rectosigmoid, 
there were no major complications. Thirteen subjects experienced minor symptoms 
(self-limited bleeding and pain), which were not related to the number of biopsies.( 10) 
Most relevant to the current study, a summary of procedures across several Microbicide 
Trial Network (an NIH-funded, international network designed to develop topi[INVESTIGATOR_443764]) was published in 2017.( 11) This manuscript reported on the safety 
of 1,004 sigmoidscopy procedures with >15,000 biopsy collection from 278 research 
participants. Many participants underwent multiple procedures (median 3 procedures). 
There were no serious adverse events, and an AE related to sigmoidoscopy was 
reported in 1.6% of procedures. Eight of the 16 related AEs reported were abdominal 
pain, flatulence, bleeding, diarrhea, and bloating. Fourteen of the 16 related AEs were 
grade 1 and 2/16 were grade 2; median time to resolution was 1 day. The authors 
concluded that repeated intestinal mucosal biopsies for research purposes are safe. 
Thus, based on the available data, the risk of serious complications from the proposed 
study procedures, even with up to 10 biopsy specimens, is expected to be very low 
(<1:5000). 
There is theoretical risk of increased acquisition of HIV or other infection if a study 
participant is exposed soon after the rectal biopsy procedure (i.e. while the mucosal 
surface is damaged).  Therefore, study subjects will be counseled not to engage in anal 
intercourse for 1 week after the rectal biopsy procedure. 
Biologic samples will be coded with a unique identifier prior to processing and storage 
for immunologic assays.  Therefore, lab personnel will be unable to link specimens with 
participants.  Only the PI [INVESTIGATOR_413610]-investigators/study personnel will be able to 
access information to identify specimens of individual participants.  
BREACH OF CONFIDENTIALITY
All measures will be taken to ensure information provided by [CONTACT_443796].  Identifying paper information will be kept in a separate locked office and 
only accessible by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_32528].  Electronic data will be stored on the

each visit.
Participants who enter into Arm A, Arm B, and Arm C will be compensated $25 for visit 
1, $25 for visit 2, $50 for visits that include swab collections in addition to blood and 
urine, and $125 for visits in which a rectal biopsy procedure is performed (Total=$275 
per subgroup completion). 
If a contingency visit is necessary, participants will be compensated $[ADDRESS_865459] if available. 
PLAN FOR OBTAINING INFORMED CONSENT
After being screened for eligibility by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_80721], subjects will be 
informed about the study and asked to sign an Emory IRB approved informed consent. 
The consent form will describe the purpose of the study, the procedures to be followed, 
and the risks and benefits of participation. Subjects will be consented in a private exam 
room.  Subjects will be given time to read the consent, ask questions and consider the 
risks and/or benefits to participation in this research study prior to obtaining their 
signature. All subjects enrolled in the study will be given a copy of their signed and

Version 6/5/[ADDRESS_865460] PRIVACY AND DATA CONFIDENTIALITY
All subjects will provide informed consent in a private room at the Hope Clinic.
Case report forms (CRFs) will be provided for each subject to collect demographic, 
behavioral, clinical, and laboratory data at study entry, and additional clinical data at the 
study visit. These data will be collected from the screening clinical assessment, the 
study entry physical examination and screening laboratory tests, and rectal biopsy 
visits. Subjects will be identified by [CONTACT_443799] (PID), which will 
be provided by [CONTACT_443800].  All laboratory specimens, 
evaluation forms, reports, and other records that leave the site will be identified by 
[CONTACT_191342]. All study samples will be kept in a 
secure area in a limited-access laboratory facility and only the research team will have 
access to the samples. The samples and data will be identified only by [CONTACT_63903].
Any identifiable records will be kept locked accessible only by [CONTACT_443801]. Electronic data will be password protected and stored on the Redcap server 
or the Emory School of Medicine HIPAA compliant server. Biologic samples will be 
coded with a unique identifier and no identifiable behavioral data will be shared with 
laboratory investigators at CDC.  Information about the subject’s participation will not be 
shared with individuals who are not directly involved with the research subjects.  Clinical 
information will not be released without written permission of the subject, except as 
necessary for monitoring by [CONTACT_1744], the FDA, the NIH, or the OHRP. Information about the 
subject’s participation will not be shared with individuals who are not directly involved 
with the research subjects.
PLANS FOR SUBJECTS AT THE END OF THE PROTOCOL
Subjects will return to the standard of care at the end of the protocol.  Subjects who are 
interested in starting PrEP will be linked to care with a community provider. In the event

The Emory University IRB, the OHRP, FDA, or other government regulatory authorities 
may perform clinical site monitoring.  Clinical research sites monitoring may include the 
review of the individual participant records, including consent forms, CRFs, supporting 
data, laboratory specimen records, and medical records (physicians’ progress notes, 
nurses’ notes, individuals’ hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1332]) to ensure protection of study participants, 
compliance with the protocol, and accuracy and completeness of records.  The monitors 
may also inspect sites’ regulatory files to ensure that regulatory requirements are being 
followed.
The investigators will make study documents (e.g., consent forms, CRFs) and pertinent 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_443766].
ADVERSE EVENT MONITORING AND REPORTING
Adverse Event Reporting
An Adverse Event (AE) as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation 
subject administered a pharmaceutical product regardless of its causal relationship to 
the study treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated 
with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product.
Any AE that is reported to either the investigators or their designated research 
associates by a study subject or by [CONTACT_646365]’s chart.  The reporting period for 
participant AEs begins at enrollment and continues until the subject either completes or 
withdraws from the study.
All AEs and laboratory abnormalities will be graded according to the Division of AIDS 
Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events (DAIDS AE 
Grading Table), Version 2.1, July 2017, which can be found on the DAIDS RCC Web 
site: http://rcc.tech-res.com/tox_tables.htm.  
Each AE will be assessed for relatedness to study product. Study investigators will 
determine AEs to be either definitely related, probably related, possibly related or not 
related to study product. If the adverse event is, in the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], possibly, 
probably, or not related to study drug or procedures, then an alternate etiology will be

Emory IRB protocol
PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: [INVESTIGATOR_443754] F. Kelley, MD, MPH
Version 6/5/2020 28Related AEs ≥ Grade 3 will be included in the summary reports provided to the Medical 
Monitor of the study. Exceptions to expedited reporting are detailed below. 
This study uses FDA approved drugs with known common side effects (please refer to 
the risk section of the protocol for common side effects).  The following side effects will 
not be reported as an EAE unless it increases in severity or becomes prolonged beyond 
the two-day study follow-up period after final biopsy/ procedure visit.
Nausea: Report if severity is a Grade 3 or higher
Vomiting: Report if severity is a grade 3 or higher
Diarrhea: Report if severity is a Grade 3 or higher
Headache: Report if severity is a Grade 3 or higher
Rash: Report if severity is a Grade 3 or higher
Serious Adverse Event Reporting
Additionally, clinical investigators will monitor subjects for Serious Adverse Events 
(SAE) during each study visit. 
A SAE is an adverse drug experience that results in any of the following outcomes:
1. Death.
2. Life-threatening situation - The subject was at risk of death at the time of the 
adverse event/experience.  It does not refer to the hypothetical risk of death if the 
AE were more severe or were to progress.
3. Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081].
4. Persistent or significant disability/incapacity - Any AE having an outcome that is 
associated with a substantial disruption of the ability to carry out normal life 
functions, including the ability to work.  This is not intended to include transient 
interruption of daily activities.
5. Congenital anomaly/birth defects - Any structural abnormality in subject’s 
offspring that occurs after intrauterine exposure to treatment.
6. Important medical events/experiences that may not result in death, be life-
threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse 
event/experience when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may 
jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed above, i.e., death, a life-threatening adverse 
event/experience, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_646351]: ART Persistence 
Emory IRB protocol
PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: [INVESTIGATOR_443754] F. Kelley, MD, MPH
Version 6/5/2020 29hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or a congenital 
anomaly/birth defect. Examples of such medical events/experiences include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at 
home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.
In this protocol, spontaneous and elective abortions will be also be considered SAEs. 
All SAEs will be reported to the Medical Monitor within 24 hours of site awareness. 
Any SAE that is considered 1) unanticipated 2) related to study product AND 3) places 
participants at greater risk of harm than previous known is an Unanticipated Problem 
(UP) and will be reported to the IRB within [ADDRESS_865462] 
Emory IRB reporting guidelines for AE and SAE reporting, as documented at 
http://www.emory.edu/IRB/guidelines_adverse_event.php, will be followed.  
It should however be noted that a severe adverse event /experience is not necessarily 
serious, as the term severe is a measure of intensity while a serious adverse event 
(SAE) is determined based on the aforementioned regulatory criteria.
DATA SAFETY MONITORING
Summaries of adverse events (Grades 3 or 4), and targeted AEs across study groups 
as well as study conduct will be reviewed regularly (in real time and summarized 
quarterly) by [CONTACT_2792]. 
Additional safety monitoring will be performed annually by [CONTACT_443802].  Based on the 1-year accrual expectation for the study, it is anticipated 
that the study will undergo [ADDRESS_865463]. The safety report will 
summarize grade 3 and 4 AEs and SAEs by [CONTACT_2060].   The Medical Safety Monitor 
will complete a ‘final assessment’ following the review of each safety report.  As part of 
the final assessment the Medical Safety Monitor will conclude ‘the study can continue 
as no safety concerns have been identified at the time of the review’ or ‘the study 
cannot continue as currently designed’. The final assessment by [CONTACT_646366] [INVESTIGATOR_646352].
In addition to the medical monitor, we will also conduct site monitoring for data quality 
and protocol compliance. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_646353]. In addition, we will 
perform self-monitoring twice yearly using the EU-Self-monitoring Tool available at 
http://www.ctac.emory.edu/clinical_trial_resources/Audit%20Tools.html. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_646354]: ART Persistence

Version 6/5/[ADDRESS_865464] with contaminated needles, blood, 
and blood products. Appropriate blood and secretion precautions will be employed by [CONTACT_443804], as 
currently recommended by [CONTACT_443805]. All infectious specimens will be transported using 
packaging mandated in the Code of Federal Regulations, 42 CFR Part 72.
BIOSAFETY PLAN
No specific biosafety plan is necessary for this protocol as all planned laboratory assays 
will fall under the existing biosafety protocols of the Hope Clinic and CDC.

blood sample is collected.  
Concomitant Drug/Therapy 
Use of any non -study drug treatment for AK lesions on the treatment area is prohibited until Day 57 .  Any 
lesion in the treatment area that is treated during the Recurrence Follow-up Period will be considered as a 
recurrence.  
Assessments 
Activity Assessments  
The Investigator will perform a count of AK lesions for all subjects a t Visits 1 and 2, Visits 7 through 10, and 
for Day 57 complete responders, also at Visits 11 through 14. 
Safety Assessments  
Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_547994] (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), laboratory 
evaluation of hematology, biochemistry, and urinalysis values, measurement of weight and vital signs, 
evaluation of ECGs, and the performance of physical examinations.  
Subjects will be queried for spontaneously reported AE s at each study visit, before assessment of local 
skin react ions (LSRs).  AEs will be reported separately from LSRs. 
Subject -reported LSRs will not be reported as adverse events.  
Other Assessments  
The LSR assessment is the Investigator’s (or trained designee ’s) assessment of the following signs on the 
treatment area:  erythema, flaking/scaling, crusting, swelling, vesiculation/pustulation, and erosion/ulceration.

FINAL v3.0_26 Sep 2016  Page 6  
CONFIDENTIAL 
 These signs will be assessed using a grading scale ranging from 0 (not present)  
to 4 (worst).   In addition to LSRs, hypo- and hyper- pi[INVESTIGATOR_547927].  Application site reactions not classified as LSRs (eg, pruritus, 
pain, infection) will be reported as adverse events.   All application site reactions and LSRs will be 
followed to re solution, or if resolution is unl ikely, to stabilization.  LSRs will be reported separately from 
AEs.  
Standardized photography will be performed at Screening (Visit 1), Day 1 (Visit 2), Day 8 (Visit 7), 
Day 57 (Visit 10), and during the Recurrence Follow-up (at 3, 6, 9, and [ADDRESS_717130]- Day 57).  Before 
study medication application on Day 1, the Investigator or a qualified staff member must obtain 
standardized photography of each subject’s treatment area before application of study medication.  
Pharmacokin etic Assessments 
PK samples will be collected at the following timepoints  for Cohort 1: 
• Day 1:  predose, 0.5 (±5 minutes), 1 and 4 hours (±10 minutes) postdose  
• Day 5:  predose, 0.5 (±5 minutes), 1 and 4 hours (±10 minutes) postdose

 clearance at Day 57 (Visit 10) without any identified AK lesions on the treatment area at [ADDRESS_717132]-Day 57.  
Analysis Sets  
• Per-Protocol Set:  the group of protocol-eligible subjects who receive 5 days (Cohort 1) or 3 days 
(Cohort 2) of study treatment and complete at least one scheduled post-treatment evaluation. 
• Evaluable Set:  the group of subjects who receive 5 days (Cohort 1) or 3 days (Cohort 2) of treatment 
and complete most evaluations including the Day 57 Follow-up Visit. 
• Safety Analysis/Full Analysis Set:  the group of subjects who receive at least one dose of study 
treatment. 
• PK Analysis Set: the group of subjects who receive study treatment and complete at least one 
scheduled post-treatment PK evaluation. 
Activity Analyses  
AK lesion counts will be summarized  by [CONTACT_547996] 1 (pretreatment) and at each subsequent timepoint 
for subjects in the Full Analysis Set  and the Per-Protocol Set. 
A 95% confidence interval (CI) for the complete clearance (response rate) at Day 57 will be estimated by 
[CONTACT_547997]. 
Recurrence rates for all subjects who achieved co mplete clearance at Day 57 will be estimated by 
[CONTACT_547998]. 
A 95% CI for the sustained response rate at [ADDRESS_717133] one dose of KX2-391 Ointment 1% will be included in the s afety 
analyses.  Treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) are defined as either those AEs with an onset after dosing or 
those pre -existing AEs that worsen after dosing.  For AEs, verbatim terms on the case report 
form/electronic case report form (CRF/eCRF) will be m apped to preferred terms (PTs) and system organ 
classes (SOCs) using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA; v 16. 0 or higher).  
Subject incidence of AEs will be displayed by [CONTACT_2946].   The incidence of AEs will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_9084].  Adverse events will also be summarized by [CONTACT_926], relationship to study drug , and cohort.  
Subject incidence of SAEs will also be displayed  by [CONTACT_9084] .  Laboratory parameters will be summarized 
using descriptive statistics at baseline and at each subseque nt timepoint by [CONTACT_9084] .  Changes from baseline 
will also be summarized  by [CONTACT_9084].  In addition, shift tables (ie, low-normal- high at baseline versus low-
normal -high at follow-up in a 3-by- 3 contingency table) will be provided to assess changes in laboratory 
values from baseline to follow -up in each cohort. 
Local skin reactions, pi[INVESTIGATOR_371], and scarring as reported by [CONTACT_737], will be displayed and 
summarized by [CONTACT_547999]. 
Similar to the activity analyses, any contrast between the [ADDRESS_717134] de viation (SD), median, minimum, and maximum.  
Categorical variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_374560].  All raw data obtained from the CRF/eCRF, as well as any derived data will be included in 
data listings.  
Sample Size Rationale 
For either cohort, a  sample size of [ADDRESS_717135] a 100% complete clearance rate at 
Day 57 greater than 20% with 80% power, based on a two -sided (alpha=0.05) binomial test, assuming a 
response rate of 35%, and less than a 25% dropout rate.  This corresponds to a two -sided 95% CI with a 
half-width of less than 15% (ie, lower boundary of the CI above 20%).  The sample size of Cohort 2 may 
be adjusted, depending on the results of Cohort 1.

7 INTRODUCTION 
7.1 Indication 
In this study, the activity, safety, and pharm acokinetics (PK) of KX2-391 Ointment 1% will 
be evaluated in adult subjects with a clinical diagnosis of stable, clinically typi[INVESTIGATOR_547931] (AK) on the face or scalp.

CONFIDENTIAL 
 7.1.1 Mechanism of Action 
KX2-391 (also referred to as KX01) is a synt hetic and highly selective inhibitor of Src 
tyrosine kinase signaling and tubulin polymer ization. KX2-[ADDRESS_717150] overall response in  these early studies has been ‘stable disease’ 
in 25-30% of patients. 
KX2-391 promotes the induction of p53, G2/M arrest of proliferating cell populations and 
subsequent apoptosis via the stimulation of Ca spase-[ADDRESS_717151] clinical activity in dermatology indications 
such as actinic keratosis.  Potent inhibition of the growth of primary human keratinocytes and 
several melanoma cell lines in vitro (50% growth inhibition [GI
50 values] ≤50 nM), suggests 
that KX2-391 has the potential to inhibit the proliferative expansion and promote apoptosis 
of abnormally proliferating cells in the epi[INVESTIGATOR_547932]. 
KX2-391 has also been observed to inhibit T cell migration and endothelial tubule formation 
in vitro, suggesting additional potential therapeutic benefits for conditions where pathology is supported by [CONTACT_548004], inflammation, and/or angiogenesis. 
Information regarding KX2-391 nonclinical studies is provided in the Investigato r’s 
Brochure. 
7.1.2 Clinical Experience with 
KX2-391  
KX2-391 Ointment 1% has been administered  to humans in ongoing study KX01-AK-01-
US.  Based on preliminary PK data from this study in AK lesions on the forearm, the systemic exposure to KX2-[ADDRESS_717152] ication site reactions and systemic toxicity. 
KX2-391 has been administered orally to a pproximately 120 patients with malignancy. 
The Kinex studies of oral KX2-391 are as follows: 
KX2-391 was evaluated in a Phase I clinical trial, Study No. KX01-01- 07, entitled “A 
Combined Rising Single-Dose (RSD) and Rising Multiple-Dose (RMD) Phase I Study to Evaluate Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacoki netics of KX2-391 in Patients with Advanced 
Malignancies That Are Refractory to Conventional Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]”.  
KX2-391 has been evaluated in Study No. KX01-002- 09, entitled “A Phase II, Open -Label, 
Single-Arm Study Evaluating the Safety, Ef ficacy and Pharmacokinetics of KX2-[ADDRESS_717153] Not Received 
Prior Chemotherapy.”  
KX2-391 was evaluated in Study No, KX01-03- 11, “A Phase 1b Rising Multi ple-Dose 
Clinical Study to Evaluate Safety, Tolerabili ty and Activity of Oral Monotherapy with 
KX2-391 in Elderly Subjects with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) Who Are Refractory to or Have Declined Standard Induction Therapy”.  
7.2 Study Rationale 
Actinic keratoses represent the initial intra-epi[INVESTIGATOR_547933] a (SCC).  Squamous 
cell carcinoma is the second leading cause of skin cancer deaths in the US, with up to 65% of 
SCC arising from pre-existing actinic keratoses.2,3  The risk of progression has been 
determined to be between  0.025% and 16% per year,2,4 and the calculated lifetime risk of 
malignant transformation for a patient with AKs followed up for 10 years is between 6.1% and 10.2%.
5  The rationale behind treating every AK is  based on the difficulty in predicting 
which single AK will progress to squamous cell carcinoma.6,7  Suchniak et al8 reported 36% 
of lesions previously diagnosed clinically as AKs being in fact SCC, with 14% being in situ SCC.  Ehrig et al
9 showed that 4% of AKs clinically diagnosed by [CONTACT_17685]-certified 
dermatologists were in fact SCC and 5% were  considered occult early stage of cutaneous 
malignancy.  Spontaneous regression has been  reported in up to 25.9% of AKs over a 
12-month period, although 15% later reappeared.10,11,[ADDRESS_717154] cosmetically acceptable 
outcomes.  Current approved/marketed trea tment has shown up to approximately 60% 
efficacy, with a recurrence rate of approximately 35%.

9 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 
9.1 Overall Study Design and Plan 
This study will be an open-label, multicenter, activity, safety, tolerability, and PK study of 
KX2-391 Ointment 1% administered topi[INVESTIGATOR_547935] 2 sequential c ohorts:  a 5-day dosing regimen (Cohort 1) and a 3-day dosing 
regimen (Cohort 2). 
The study consists of Screening, Treatment, and Follow-up Periods. 
Cohort 1:  
Eligible subjects will receive 5 consecutive days  of topi[INVESTIGATOR_35786], to be applied at the 
study site, with 50 mg of KX2-391 Ointment 1% each day.  Blood samples for PK analysis will be collected on Day 1 and Day 5.  Subjects will return for Follow-up visits until Day 57.  
Thereafter, only Day 57 complete responders w ill continue Recurrence Follow-up Visits 
every 3 months for an additional 12 months afte r Day 57.  Activity (lesion counts) and safety 
evaluations will be performed. 
Cohort 2: 
Eligible subjects will receive 3 consecutive days  of topi[INVESTIGATOR_35786], to be applied at the 
study site, with 50 mg of KX2-391 Ointment 1% each day.  Blood samples for PK analysis will be collected on Day 1 and Day 3.  Subjects will return for Follow-up visits until Day 57.  
Thereafter, only Day 57 complete responders w ill continue Recurrence Follow-up Visits 
every 3 months for an additional 12 months afte r Day 57.  Activity (lesion counts) and safety 
evaluations will be performed. 
For both cohorts, subjects may stay for approx imately [ADDRESS_717156] PK blood sample is coll ected on Days 1 and 5 (Cohort 1) or Days 1 and 3

CONFIDENTIAL 
 The Sponsor will review accumulating data.  If the 5-day regime n (Cohort 1) has sufficient 
activity and safety to warrant evaluating a 3- day regimen, enrollment of Cohort 2 will start 
after there are 60 evaluable subjects or up to 80 s ubjects are enrolled (whichever comes first) 
in Cohort 1.  For the most part, protocol proc edures for Cohort [ADDRESS_717157] dose of study drug.  All screening assessments/evaluations, as presented in Table [ADDRESS_717158] provides informed 
consent and eligibility criteria are met. 
Treatment Area Identification 
At Screening (Visit 1), the Investigator will se lect a continuous treatment area affected with 
AK on the face or scalp for each subject that: 
x measures 25 cm
2 
x contains 4 to 8 AK lesions that are clinically typi[INVESTIGATOR_547936]. 
At Visit 1, the Investigator and an investigational center staff member will identify the 
treatment area by:  
x Examining the face or scalp and locating e ach AK with a dot of removable marker. 
x Using an [ADDRESS_717159] 2 anatomical landmarks on the acetate sheet.  Example of landmarks 
could be bony prominences, scars, moles, seborrheic keratosis, and veins. 
x Indicating the location of AK lesions with  permanent marker dots on the acetate 
transparency sheet.

x Removing marker dots on the face/scalp with  alcohol swabs or water (after taking the 
screening photo). 
9.1.2 Treatment Period 
The inclusion/exclusion criteria will be review ed again prior to treatment on Day 1, to 
re-confirm subjects’ eligibility to participate in the study . 
Subjects in Cohort 1 will be treated for 5 cons ecutive days (Days 1-5 [Visits 2-6]) during the 
Treatment Period.  Visits 2 through 6 should be scheduled to occur at approximately the 
same time each day. 
Subjects in Cohort 2 will be treated for 3 cons ecutive days (Days 1-3 [Visits 2-4]) during the 
Treatment Period.  Subjects will not return on Day 4 (Visit 5) or Day 5 (Visit 6).  Visits 2 
through 4 should be scheduled to occur at approximately the same time each day.  
At Visit 2 (Day 1), prior to study drug application, the Investigator and any appropriate 
investigational staff member(s) (Investigator-tra ined designee) will confirm the location of 
the treatment area using the Visit 1 acetate sheet.  The Investigator should re-mark the 
treatment area borders as needed so the study evaluations may be effectively completed. 
Once the treatment area has been re-ident ified at Visit 2, photographs will be taken 
(Section [IP_ADDRESS].8) .  50 mg of KX2-391 Ointment 1% will be applied topi[INVESTIGATOR_231704]

 Safety Assessments 
Safety assessments will include recording all AEs and serious adverse events (SAEs). 
Safety assessments also include laboratory evaluation of hematology, biochemistry, and 
urinalyses; periodic measurement of weight, vita l signs, ECGs, and performance of PEs, as 
detailed in the sections below and shown in  Table [ADDRESS_717181]-reported LSRs will not be reported as adverse events.  Treatments administered for 
LSRs will be recorded on the Concomitant Medications CRF. 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_717182].  For this study, the study drug is KX2-391 Ointment 1%. 
Treatment-emergent AEs are defined as: 
x either those AEs with an onset after dosing or  
x those pre-existing conditions that worsen after dosing 
The criteria for identifying AEs are: 
• any unfavorable and unintended sign (incl uding an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated wi th the use of an investigational product, 
whether or not considered related to the investigational product 
• any new disease or exacerbation of an existing disease  
• any deterioration in nonprotocol-required mea surements of a laboratory value or other 
clinical test (eg, ECG or x-ray) that result s in symptoms, a change in treatment, or 
discontinuation from study drug 
• recurrence of an intermittent medical conditi on (eg, headache) not present at baseline 
All AEs, regardless of relationship to study drug  or procedure, should be collected beginning 
from the time the subject signs the study IC F through the final contact [CONTACT_548013]-up 
Period on Day 57.   For subjects participating in the Recurrence Follow-up Period, only AEs 
at the treatment area will be collected. 
Subjects with study drug-related AEs will be followed until resolution, resolved with 
sequelae, or under medical care.  All SAEs must be followed to resolution or, if resolution is 
unlikely, to stabilization. 
All AEs observed during the study will be reported on the CRF/eCRF. 
Laboratory Adverse Events 
A treatment-emergent abnormal laboratory test re sult should be considered as a treatment-
emergent AE (TEAE) if the identified labor atory abnormality leads to any type of 
intervention whether prescribed in the protocol or not. 
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 2 KX01-AK-002 
 
 
Kinex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
FINAL v3.0_26 Sep 2016  Page 38  
CONFIDENTIAL 
 An abnormal laboratory result should be considered by [CONTACT_548014]: 
x results in the withdrawal of study drug 
x results in withholding of study drug pending some investigational outcome 
x results in the initiation of an inte rvention, based on medical evaluation (eg, 
potassium supplement for hypokalemia) 
x results in any out of range laboratory value that in the Investigator ’s judgment 
fulfills the definitions of an AE with regard to the subject ’s medical profile  
x increases in severity compared with baseline 
Abnormal laboratory values should not be listed as  separate AEs if they are considered to be 
part of the clinical syndrome that is being reported  as an AE.  It is the responsibility of the 
Investigator to review all laboratory findings in  all subjects and determine if they constitute 
an AE.  Medical and scientific judgment should be  exercised in deciding whether an isolated 
laboratory abnormality should be classified  as an AE.  Any laboratory abnormality 
considered to constitute an AE should be reported on the Adverse Event CRF/eCRF. 
For significant treatment-emergent laboratory abnormalities meeting criteria as SAEs, the 
study site must submit an SAE report to the Sponsor or designee using the SAE reporting procedures described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] .  However, if a significant treatment-emergent 
laboratory abnormality is accompanied by, and is  part of the syndrome of, a serious clinical 
event or diagnosis, it is the clinical event/d iagnosis that should be reported as the SAE and 
not the significant treatment-emergent laboratory abnormality. 
ECG changes and associated clinical symptoms determined to be clinically significant by [CONTACT_548015].  An ECG abnormality in a subject with symptoms may 
meet the criteria for an AE as described in this protocol.  In these instances, the AE 
corresponding to the symptomatic ECG abnormality will be recorded on the Adverse Events CRF/eCRF. 
For symptomatic ECG abnormalities meeting criteria as SAEs, the study site must submit an 
SAE report, including the ECG report to the Sponsor, or designee, using the SAE reporting procedures ( Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
Assessing Severity of Adverse Events 
Every effort must be made by [CONTACT_548016].  
Adverse events will be graded for severity as follows: 
Mild An event that is easily tolerated by  [CONTACT_102], causing minimal discomfort 
and not interfering with everyday activities 
Moderate An event that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with everyday 
activities 
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 2 KX01-AK-002 
 
 
Kinex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
FINAL v3.0_26 Sep 2016  Page 39  
CONFIDENTIAL 
 Severe An event that prevents normal everyday activities  
Investigators will assess severity for all AEs (f or both increasing and decreasing severity).  
The criteria for assessing severity are different from those used for seriousness (see Section [IP_ADDRESS].2 ). 
Assessing Relationship to Study Treatment 
Items to be considered when assessing the relationship of an AE to the study treatment are: 
x temporal relationship of the onset of the event to the initiation of the study treatment 
x the course of the event, especially the effe ct of discontinuation of study treatment or 
reintroduction of study treatment, as applicable 
x whether the event is known to be associated  with the study treatment or with other 
similar treatments 
x the presence of risk factors in the study s ubject known to increase the occurrence of 
the event 
x the presence of nonstudy treatment-related factors that are known to be associated 
with the occurrence of the event 
Classification of Causality 
The relationship of each AE to the study drug will be recorded on the CRF/eCRF using the 
following criteria: 
Definitely Related:   A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, occurring in a 
plausible time relationship to drug administ ration, and which cannot be explained by 
[CONTACT_548017]:   A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable 
time sequence to administration of the drug, unl ikely to be attributed to concurrent or 
underlying disease or other drugs or conditions  
Possibly Related:   A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable 
time sequence to administration of the drug, but wh ich could also be explained by [CONTACT_548018]:   A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a temporal 
relationship to drug administration which makes  a causal relationship improbable, and in 
which other drugs, conditions or concurrent  or underlying disease provide plausible 
explanations

 • is life-threatening (ie, the subject was at immediate risk of death from the AE as it 
occurred; this does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form or 
was allowed to continue, might have caused death) 
• requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
• is a congenital anomaly/birth defect (in th e child of a subject who was exposed to the 
study drug) 
Other important medical events that may not be  immediately life-threatening or result in 
death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], when based on appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to pre vent one of the outcomes in the definition of 
SAE listed above should also be considered SAEs.  Medical and scientific judgment should 
be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in such situations. 
In addition to the above, other events of inte rest, which include pregnancy and overdose, are 
to be captured using the SAE procedures described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] , but are to be 
considered as SAEs only if they met one of the above criteria.  All events of these types are 
to be reported on the Adverse Events CRF/eCRF whether or not they meet the criteria for SAEs. 
The following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_547960] “AE” (ie, 
there is no untoward medical occurrence) associated with the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]:

Standardized photography will be performed at Screening (Visit 1), Day 1 (Visit 2), Day 8 
(Visit 7), Day 57 (Visit 10), and during the Recurrence Follow-up (at 3, 6, 9, and [ADDRESS_717186]-Day 57).  Before study medication application on Day 1, the Investigator or a qualified staff member must obtain standardized photograph y of each subject’s treatment area before 
application of study medication. 
Care must be taken to ensure the same ligh ting, background, subject positioning relative to 
the camera and camera settings are used for  each photograph.  Equipment, supplies and 
detailed instructions for obtaining and managin g the photographs will be provided to the 
investigational center prior to the initiation of subject enrollment. 
The photographs are to document the appearance of the subjects’ treatment area and to assist 
with the identification and confirmation of the location of the treatment area throughout the 
study ( Section 9.1.1 ). 
Equipment, supplies and detailed instructions for obtaining and managing the photographs 
will be provided to the investigational center  prior to the initiation of subject enrollment.  
9.5.[ADDRESS_717187], will be collected (ie, Day 57 plus 30 days).  During the Recurrence Follow-up 
Period, all AEs, including SAEs in the treatment area will be collected until the last subject 
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_717188] information for reporting of SA Es will be provided in the Investigator 
File. 
It is very important that the SAE report form be  filled out as completely as possible at the 
time of the initial report. This includes the Investigator ’s assessment of causality.  All 
supporting documents should be sent de-identified and should contain the assigned subject 
number.  Only supporting documents directly related to the event should be sent. 
Any follow-up information received on SAEs should be forwarded as soon as possible.  If the 
follow-up information changes the Investigator ’s assessment of causality, this should also be 
noted on the follow-up SAE form. 
Preliminary SAE reports should be followed as  soon as possible by [CONTACT_3582][INVESTIGATOR_3103], autopsy reports, and other documents requested by [CONTACT_1034]. 
 Reporting of Pregnancy 
Any pregnancy, whether occurring in a subject or in the female partner of a male subject, for 
which the estimated date of conception was either before the last visit or within [ADDRESS_717189] be reported. 
If an adverse outcome of a pregnancy is suspected to be related to study drug exposure, this 
should be reported regardless of the length of ti me that has passed since the exposure to study 
treatment. 
A congenital anomaly, death during perinatal period, an induced abortion, or a spontaneous 
abortion are considered to be an SAE and shoul d be reported in the same timeframe and in 
the same format as all other SAEs (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
Pregnancies must be reported by [CONTACT_548019] 
[ADDRESS_717190] 
[IP_ADDRESS].1 R EPORTING OF ADVERSE EVENTS ASSOCIATED WITH STUDY DRUG OVERDOSE , 
MISUSE , ABUSE , OR MEDICATION ERROR  
Study drug overdose is defined as the accidental or intentional use of the drug in an amount 
higher than the dose being studied. 
Any study drug overdose should be noted on the Study Medication CRF/eCRF. All AEs associated with overdose, or medicati on error should be captured on the Adverse 
Event CRF/eCRF and also reported using the procedures detailed in Section [IP_ADDRESS] even if 
the AEs do not meet serious criteria.  If th e AE associated with an overdose or medication 
error does not meet serious criteria, it must still be reported using the SAE form and in an 
expedited manner, but should be noted as nons erious on the SAE form and the Adverse 
Event CRF/eCRF. 
 Expedited Reporting 
The Sponsor (or its designee) must inform In vestigators and regulatory authorities of 
reportable events, in compliance with appli cable regulatory requirements, on an expedited 
basis (ie, within specific timeframes).  For th is reason, it is imperative that sites provide 
complete SAE information in the manner described above. 
In determining what SAEs meet criteria for ex pedited reporting, the current version of the 
Investigator ’s Brochure will be used  for reference safety information.

Objectives
Primary Objective :
•To evaluate the activity of KX2- 391 Ointment 1% administered topi[INVESTIGATOR_547920] (AK) by [CONTACT_547992], defined as 100% 
clearance at Day 57
Secondary Objectives: 
•To assess the activity of KX2-391 Ointment 1% during Days 1-57
•To assess the safety and tolerability of KX2- 391 Ointment 1% in subjects with AK on the face or 
scalp
•To assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of KX2- 391 Ointment 1% in subjects with AK on the face or 
scalp
•To assess dose regimens by [CONTACT_456105] 5-day treatment with 3- day treatment in terms of the activity 
and safety of KX2-391 Ointment 1% in subjects with AK on the face or scalp
Exploratory Objective s:
•To determine recurrence rates up to [ADDRESS_717216]-Day 57 for subjects who show response at 
Day 57
•To determine sustained response rates at [ADDRESS_717217]- Day 57 for subjects who show response at

•Planned enrollment period for each cohort:  approximately 3 months (90 days)
•Planned subject participation is approximately 64 weeks: 
oScreening Period:  up to 28 days
oTreatment Period:  For Cohort 1, 5 consecutive treatment days (Days 1-5); for Cohort 2, 
3 consecutive treatment days (Days 1-3)
oFollow-up Period:  Visits at Days 8, 15, 29, and 57
oRecurrence Follow- up Period:  only for complete responders at Day 57, visits every 3 months for 
12 months after Day 57 (ie, at 3, 6, 9, and [ADDRESS_717225]-Day 57).
Length of stay:  On Day 1 (Visit 2 , Cohorts 1 and 2) and Day 5 (Visit 6, Cohort 1) or Day 3 (Visit 4, 
Cohort 2) , subjects may stay for approximately [ADDRESS_717226] PK 
blood s ample is collected.
Concomitant Drug/Therapy
Use of any non -study drug treatment for AK lesions on the treatment area is prohibited until Day 57 .  Any 
lesion in the treatment area that is treated during the Recurrence Follow-up Period will be considered as a 
recurrence.
Assessments
Activity Assessments
The Investigator will perform a count of AK lesions for all subjects at Visits 1 and 2, Visits 7 through 10, and 
for Day 57 complete responders, also at Visits 11 through 14.
Safety Assessments
Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_547994] (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), laboratory 
evaluation of hematology, biochemistry, and urinalysis values, measurement of weight and vital signs, 
evaluation of ECGs, and the performance of physical examinati ons.
Subjects will be queried for spontaneously reported AE s at each study visit, before assessment of local 
skin reactions (LSRs).  AEs will be reported separately from LSRs.
Subject -reported LSRs will not be reported as adverse events. 
Other Assessments
The LSR assessment is the Investigator’s (or trained designee ’s) assessment of the following signs on the 
treatment area:  erythema, flaking/scaling, crusting, swelling, vesiculation/pustulation, and erosion/ulceration.  
These signs will be assessed using a grading scale ranging from 0 (not present) 
to 4 (worst). In addition to LSRs, hypo- and hyper- pi[INVESTIGATOR_547971]_Amendment 1 KX01-AK-002

 be assessed as being present or absent.  Application site reactions not classified as LSRs (eg, pruritus, 
pain, infection) will be reported as adverse events.   All application site reactions and LSRs will be 
followed to resolution, or if resolu tion is unlikely, to stabilization.   LSRs will be reported separately from 
AEs.  
Standardized photography will be performed at Screening (Visit 1), Day 1 (Visit 2), Day 8 (Visit 7), 
Day 57 (Visit 10), and during the Recurrence Follow-up (at 3, 6, 9, and [ADDRESS_717227]- Day 57).  Before 
study medication application on Day 1, the Investigator or a qualified staff member must obtain 
standardized photography of each subject’s treatment area before application of study medication.  
Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
PK samples will be collected at the following timepoints  for Cohort 1: 
• Day 1:  predose, 0.5 (±5 minutes), 1 and 4 hours (±10 minutes) postdose  
• Day 5:  predose, 0.5 (±5 minutes), 1 and 4 hours (±10 minutes) postdose 
PK samples will be collected at the following timepoints for Cohort 2:  
• Day 1:  predose, 0.5 (±5 minutes), 1 and 4 hours (±10 minutes) postdose  
• Day 3:  predose, 0.5 (±5 minutes),  1 and 4 hours (±10 minutes) postdose  
Pharmacodynamic, Pharmacogenomic, and Other Biomarker Assessments  
Not applicable  
Bioanalytical Methods 
Plasma concentrations of study drug will be measured using a validated liquid chromatography/tandem 
mass spectrometry (LC -MS/MS) assay. 
Statistical Methods 
Study Endpoints  
Primary Endpoint  
x Activity will be evaluated by [CONTACT_547995].  Complete response rate will be defined as 
the proportion of subjects achieving 100% complete clearance o f all treated AK lesions on the face 
or scalp at Day 57.   
Secondary Endpoints  
• Activity:   Reduction in lesion counts during Days 1-57 
• Safety:  Evaluation of AEs and clinical laboratory data ; the results of other safety assessments (vital 
signs, physical examinations, EC Gs) will also be evaluated. 
• Pharmacokinetic:  Determination of C max and where applicable, AUC t, C min, and accumulation  
ratio R 
Exploratory Endpoint s 
• Recurrence rate will be defined as the proportion of subjects who achieved 100% complete cle arance 
at Day 57 (Visit 10) with any identified AK lesions on the treatment area at 3, 6, 9, and [ADDRESS_717228]-Day 57. 
• Sustained response rate will be defined as the proportion of subjects who achieved 100% complete 
clearance at Day 57 (Visit 10) without any identified AK lesions on the treatment area at [ADDRESS_717229]-Day 57.

 Analysis Sets 
• Per-Protocol Set:  the group of protocol-eligible subjects who receive 5 days (Cohort 1) or 3 days 
(Cohort 2) of study treatment and complete at least one scheduled post-treatment evaluation. 
• Evaluable Set:  the group of subjects who receive 5 days (Cohort 1) or 3 days (Cohort 2) of treatment 
and complete most evaluations including the Day 57 Follow-up Visit. 
• Safety Analysis/Full Analysis Set:  the group of subjects who receive at least one dose of study 
treatment. 
• PK Analysis Set: the group of subjects who receive study treatment and complete at least one 
scheduled post-treatment PK evaluation. 
Activity Analyses  
AK lesion counts will be summarized  by [CONTACT_547996] 1 (pre treatment) and at each subsequent timepoint 
for subjects in the Full Analysis Set  and the Per-Protocol Set. 
A 95% confidence interval (CI) for the complete clearance (response rate) at Day 57 will be estimated by 
[CONTACT_547997]. 
Recurrence rat es for all subjects who achieved complete clearance at Day 57 will be estimated by 
[CONTACT_547998]. 
A 95% CI for the sustained response rate at [ADDRESS_717230] one dose of KX2-391 Ointment 1% will be included in the safety 
analyses.  Treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) are defined as either those AEs with an onset after dosing or 
those pre -existing AEs that worsen after dosing.  For AEs, verbatim terms on the case report 
form/electronic case report form ( CRF/eCRF) will be mapped to preferred terms (PTs) and system organ 
classes (SOCs) using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA; v 16. 0 or higher).  
Subject incidence of AEs will  be displayed by [CONTACT_2946].  The incidence of AEs will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_9084].  Adverse events will also be summarized by [CONTACT_926], relationship to study drug , and cohort.  
Subject incidence of SAEs will also be displayed  by [CONTACT_9084].  Laboratory parameters will be summarized 
using descriptive statistics at baseline and at each subsequent timepoint  by [CONTACT_9084] .  Changes from baseline 
will also be summarized  by [CONTACT_9084].  In addition, shift tables (ie, low-normal- high at baseline versus low-
normal -high at follow-up in a 3-by- 3 contingency table) will be provided to assess changes in laboratory 
values from baseline to follow -up in each cohort. 
Local skin reactions, pi[INVESTIGATOR_371], and scarring as reported by [CONTACT_737], will be displayed and 
summarized by [CONTACT_547999]. 
Similar to the activity analyses, any contrast between the [ADDRESS_717231]  deviation (SD), median, minimum, and maximum.  
Categorical variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_374560].  All raw data obtained from the CRF/eCRF, as well as any derived data will be included in 
data lis tings.  
Sample Size Rationale 
For either cohort, a  sample size of [ADDRESS_717232] a 100% complete clearance rate at 
Day 57 greater than 20% with 80% power, based on a two -sided (alpha=0.05) binomial test, assuming a 
response rate of 35% , and less than a 25% dropout rate.  This corresponds to a two- sided 95% CI with a 
half-width of less than 15% (ie, lower boundary of the CI above 20%).  The sample size of Cohort 2 may 
be adjusted, depending on the results of Cohort 1.

related documents must be reviewed and approve d before subjects are screened for entry by 
[CONTACT_3551] (IRB) or Indepe ndent Ethics Committee (IEC) constituted and 
functioning in accordance with International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) E6 (Good 
Clinical Practice [GCP]1), Section 3, and any local regulations (eg, Federal Regulations, Title
21 Code of Federal Regulations [CFR] Part 56 ).  Documentation of IRB/IEC compliance 
with the ICH E6 and any local regulations rega rding constitution and review conduct will be 
provided to the Sponsor. 
A signed letter of study approval from the IRB/IEC chairman must be sent to the Principal 
Investigator (PI) with a copy to the Sponsor be fore study start and the release of any study 
drug to the site by [CONTACT_4885] (ICH E6, Section 4.4).  If the IRB/IEC decides 
to suspend or terminate the study, the Investig ator will immediately send the notice of study 
suspension or termination by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC to the Sponsor. 
Study progress is to be reported to IRB/IECs annually (or as required) by [CONTACT_425826], depending on local regulatory obligations.  If the Investigator is required to report 
to the IRB/IEC, he/she will forward a copy to the Sponsor at the time of each periodic report.  
The Investigator(s) or the Sponsor will subm it, depending on local regulations, periodic 
reports and inform the IRB/IEC of any reportable adverse events (AEs) per ICH guidelines and local IRB/IEC standards of practice.  Upon co mpletion of the study, the Investigator will 
provide the IRB/IEC with a brief report of the outcome of the study, if required.

7 INTRODUCTION 
7.1 Indication 
In this study, the activity, safety, and pharm acokinetics (PK) of KX2-391 Ointment 1% will 
be evaluated in adult subjects with a clinical diagnosis of stable, clinically typi[INVESTIGATOR_547931] (AK) on the face or scalp.

 7.1.1 Mechanism of Action 
KX2-391 (also referred to as KX01) is a synt hetic and highly selective inhibitor of Src 
tyrosine kinase signaling and tubulin polymer ization. KX2-[ADDRESS_717247] overall response in  these early studies has been ‘stable disease’  
in 25-30% of patients. 
KX2-391 promotes the induction of p53, G2/M arrest of proliferating cell populations and 
subsequent apoptosis via the stimulation of Ca spase-[ADDRESS_717248] clinical activity in dermatology indications 
such as actinic keratosis.  Potent inhibition of the growth of primary human keratinocytes and 
several melanoma cell lines in vitro (50% growth inhibition [GI
50 values] ≤50 nM), suggests 
that KX2-391 has the potential to inhibit the proliferative expansion and promote apoptosis 
of abnormally proliferating cells in the epi[INVESTIGATOR_547932]. 
KX2-391 has also been observed to inhibit T cell migration and endothelial tubule formation 
in vitro, suggesting additional potential therapeutic benefits for conditions where pathology is supported by [CONTACT_548004], inflammation, and/or angiogenesis. 
Information regarding KX2-391 noncli nical studies is provided in the Investigator’s 
Brochure. 
7.1.2 Clinical Experience with 
KX2-391  
KX2-391 Ointment 1% has been administered  to humans in ongoing study KX01-AK-01-
US.  Based on preliminary PK data from this study in AK lesions on the forearm, the systemic exposure to KX2-[ADDRESS_717249] ication site reactions and systemic toxicity. 
KX2-391 has been administered orally to a pproximately 120 patients with malignancy. 
The Kinex studies of oral KX2-391 are as follows: 
KX2-391 was evaluated in a Phase I clinical trial, Study No. KX01-01- 07, entitled “A 
Combined Rising Single-Dose (RSD) and Rising Multiple-Dose (RMD) Phase I Study to Evaluate Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacoki netics of KX2-391 in Patients with Advanced 
Malignancies That Are Refractory to Conventional Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]”.  
KX2-391 has been evaluated in Study No. KX01-002-09, ent itled “A Phase II, Open -Label, 
Single-Arm Study Evaluating the Safety, Ef ficacy and Pharmacokinetics of KX2-[ADDRESS_717250] Not Received 
Prior Chemotherapy.” 
KX2-391 was evaluated in Study No, KX01-03- 11, “A Phase 1b Rising Multiple -Dose 
Clinical Study to Evaluate Safety, Tolerability  and Activity of Oral Monotherapy with KX2-
391 in Elderly Subjects with Acute Myeloi d Leukemia (AML) Who Are Refractory to or 
Have Declined Standard Induction Therapy”.
7.2 Study Rationale 
Actinic keratoses represent the initial intra- epi[INVESTIGATOR_547976] (SCC).  Squamous 
cell carcinoma is the second leading cause of skin cancer deaths in the US, with up to 65% of 
SCC arising from pre-existing actinic keratoses.2,3 The risk of progression has been 
determined to be between 0.025% and 16% per year,2,4and the calculated lifetime risk of 
malignant transformation for a patient with AK s followed up for 10 years is between 6.1% 
and 10.2%.5The rationale behind treating every AK is  based on the difficulty in predicting 
which single AK will progress to squamous cell carcinoma.6,7 Suchniak et al8reported 36% 
of lesions previously diagnosed clinically as AKs being in fact SCC, with 14% being in situ 
SCC.  Ehrig et al9showed that 4% of AKs clinically diagnosed by [CONTACT_17685]-certified 
dermatologists were in fact SCC and 5% were  considered occult early stage of cutaneous 
malignancy.  Spontaneous regression has been  reported in up to 25.9% of AKs over a 
12-month period, although 15% later reappeared.10,11,12The goals of treatment are to 
completely eliminate AKs, minimizing their risk of progression to invasive SCC, reducing 
the potential to metastasize and cause death, while obtaining the best cosmetically acceptable 
outcomes.  Current approved/marketed trea tment has shown up to approximately 60% 
efficacy, with a recurrence rate of approximately 35%.

9.1.2 Treatment Period 
The inclusion/exclusion criteria will be review ed again prior to treatment on Day 1, to 
re-confirm subjects’ eligibility to participate in the study . 
Subjects in Cohort 1 will be treated for 5 cons ecutive days (Days 1-5 [Visits 2-6]) during the 
Treatment Period. Visits 2 through 6 should be  scheduled to occur at approximately the 
same time each day. 
Subjects in Cohort 2 will be treated for 3 cons ecutive days (Days 1-3 [Visits 2-4]) during the 
Treatment Period.  Subjects will not return on Day 4 (Visit 5) or Day 5 (Visit 6).  Visits 2 
through 4 should be scheduled to occur at approximately the same time each day.  
At Visit 2 (Day 1), prior to study drug application, the Investigator and any appropriate 
investigational staff member(s) (Investigator-tra ined designee) will confirm the location of 
the treatment area using the Visit 1 acetate sheet.  The Investigator should re-mark the 
treatment area borders as needed so the study evaluations may be effectively completed. 
Once the treatment area has been re-ident ified at Visit 2, photographs will be taken

Storage Conditions
Study drug will be stored in accordance w ith labeled storage conditions. Temperature 
monitoring is required at the storage location to ensure that the study drug is maintained within an established temperature range.  The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that the temperature is monitored throughout the tota l duration of the trial and that records are 
maintained; the temperature should be monitored continuously by [CONTACT_548007], a mechanical recording device, such as a calibrated chart 
recorder, or by [CONTACT_3177], such that minimu m and maximum thermometric values over a 
specific time period can be recorded and retrieved as required. 
Administration of Investigational Products
The study medication is for external topi[INVESTIGATOR_453609] e on the treatment area.  An investigational 
center staff member will perform the study medic ation applications.  Th e staff member must 
wash her/his hands before and after each study medication application. 
50 mg of KX2-391 Ointment 1% will be applied topi[INVESTIGATOR_547943] a 25 cm2 treatment area.  This 
amount contains a total of 0.5 mg KX2-391 free  base.  KX2-391 Ointment 1% will be 
applied once daily for 5 consecutive days (Cohort 1) or 3 consecutive days (Cohort 2) (see 
Table 3 ).
The staff member will weigh the appropriate amount of study medication into a weighing 
boat (or equivalent) using a calibrated scale.  The amount of study medication applied will be 
calculated by [CONTACT_548008]. The am ount of study medication weighed will be as 
close to the intended dose as possible. 
A study staff member will perform and document a scale accuracy check at least every day 
before weighing study medication. 
The stud y medication will be applied to the subj ect’s treatment area using a fingertip 
protected with a powder-free finger cot or exam ination glove. The study medication will be 
gently and evenly rubbed over the treatment area until no visible accumulation is evident. The time when the study medication applicat ion is completed (Application Completion 
Time) will be recorded. 
The study medication should remain on the treat ment area. Subjects must avoid touching or 
wetting the treatment area for at least [ADDRESS_717269] application and are not

Safety Assessments
Safety assessments will include recording all AEs and serious adverse events (SAEs).
Safety assessments also include laboratory evaluation of hematology, biochemistry, and 
urinalyses; periodic measurement of weight, vita l signs, ECGs, and performance of PEs, as 
detailed in the sections below and shown in Table [ADDRESS_717277]-reported LSRs will not be reported as  adverse events. Treatments administered for 
LSRs will be recorded on the Concomitant Medications CRF.

Treatment-emergent AEs are defined as: 
xeither those AEs with an onset after dosing or  
xthose pre-existing conditions that worsen after dosing 
The criteria for identifying AEs are: 
•any unfavorable and unintended sign (incl uding an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated wi th the use of an investigational product, 
whether or not considered related to the investigational product 
•any new disease or exacerbation of an existing disease  
•any deterioration in nonprotocol-required mea surements of a laboratory value or other

All AEs, regardless of relationship to study drug  or procedure, should be collected beginning 
from the time the subject signs the study IC F through the final contact [CONTACT_548013]-up 
Period on Day 57. For subjects participating in  the Recurrence Follow-up Period, only AEs 
at the treatment area will be collected. 
Subjects with study drug-related AEs will be followed until resolution, resolved with 
sequelae, or under medical care.  All SAEs must be  followed to resolution or, if resolution is 
unlikely, to stabilization. 
All AEs observed during the study will be reported on the CRF/eCRF. 
Laboratory Adverse Events 
A treatment-emergent abnormal laboratory test re sult should be considered as a treatment-
emergent AE (TEAE) if the identified labor atory abnormality leads to any type of 
intervention whether prescribed in the protocol or not. 
An abnormal laboratory result should be considered by [CONTACT_548014]: 
xresults in the withdrawal of study drug 
xresults in withholding of study drug pending some investigational outcome 
xresults in the initiation of an inte rvention, based on medical evaluation (eg, 
potassium supplement for hypokalemia) 
xresults in any out of range laboratory value that in the Investigator ’s judgment 
fulfills the definitions of an AE with regard to the subject ’s medical profile
xincreases in severity compared with baseline 
Abnormal laboratory values should not be listed as  separate AEs if they are considered to be 
part of the clinical syndrome that is being report ed as an AE.  It is the responsibility of the 
Investigator to review all laboratory findings in  all subjects and determine if they constitute 
an AE.  Medical and scientific judgment should be  exercised in deciding whether an isolated 
laboratory abnormality should be classified  as an AE.  Any laboratory abnormality 
considered to constitute an AE should be reported on the Adverse Event CRF/eCRF. 
ECG changes and associated clinical symptoms determined to be clinically significant by [CONTACT_548015].  An ECG abnormality in a subject with symptoms may meet the criteria for an AE as described in this protocol.  In these instances, the AE 
corresponding to the symptomatic ECG abnormality will be recorded on the Adverse Events 
CRF/eCRF. 
For symptomatic ECG abnormalities meeting criteria as SAEs, the study site must submit an 
SAE report, including the ECG report to the Sponsor, or designee, using the SAE reporting procedures ( Section [IP_ADDRESS] ).
Clinical Study Protocol_Amendment [ADDRESS_717279] be made by [CONTACT_548016].
Adverse events will be graded for severity as follows: 
Mild An event that is easily tolerated by  [CONTACT_102], causing minimal discomfort 
and not interfering with everyday activities 
Moderate An event that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with everyday 
activities 
Severe An event that prevents normal everyday activities
Investigators will assess severity for all AEs (f or both increasing and decreasing severity).  
The criteria for assessing severity are different from those used for seriousness (see Section [IP_ADDRESS].2 ).
Assessing Relationship to Study Treatment 
Items to be considered when assessing the relationship of an AE to the study treatment are: 
xtemporal relationship of the onset of the event to the initiation of the study treatment 
xthe course of the event, especially the effe ct of discontinuation of study treatment or 
reintroduction of study treatment, as applicable 
xwhether the event is known to be associated  with the study treatment or with other 
similar treatments 
xthe presence of risk factors in the study s ubject known to increase the occurrence of 
the event 
xthe presence of nonstudy treatment-related factors that are known to be associated 
with the occurrence of the event 
Classification of Causality 
The relationship of each AE to the study drug will be recorded on the CRF/eCRF using the 
following criteria: 
Definitely Related: A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, occurring in a 
plausible time relationship to drug administ ration, and which cannot be explained by 
[CONTACT_548017]: A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable 
time sequence to administration of the drug, unl ikely to be attributed to concurrent or

death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], when based on appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize 
the subject or may require intervention to pre vent one of the outcomes in the definition of

be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in such situations. 
In addition to the above, other events of in terest, which include pregnancy, overdose, and 
significant treatment-emergent laboratory abnormality (See Section [IP_ADDRESS].1 ), are to be 
captured using the SAE procedures but are to be considered as SAEs only if they met one of the above criteria. All events of these types are to be reported on the CRF/eCRF whether or not they meet the criteria for SAEs.

CONFIDENTIAL 
 • Planned subject participation is approximately 64 weeks:  
o Screening Period:  up to 28 days 
o Treatment Period:  5 consecutive treatment days (Days 1-5) 
o Follow-up Period:  Visits at Days 8, 15, 29, and 57 
o Recurrence Follow-up Period:  only for complete responders at Day 57, visits every 3 months for 
12 months after Day 57 (ie, at 3, 6, 9, and [ADDRESS_717317]-Day 57). 
Length of stay:  On Day 1 (Visit 2) and Day 5 (Visit 6), subjects will stay for approximately [ADDRESS_717318] PK blood sample is colle cted. 
Concomitant Drug/Therapy 
Use of any non -study drug treatment for AK lesions on the face or scalp is prohibited during the study.  
During the Recurrence Follow -up Period, isolated lesion treatment such as cryotherapy or biopsy is 
allowed for treatment of AK lesions emerging in the selected treatment area.  Any treated lesion will be 
considered as a recurrence.  
Assessments 
Activity Assessments  
The Investigator will perform a count of AK lesions for all subjects at Visits 1 and 2, Visits 7 through 10, and 
for Day 57 complete responders, also at Visits 11 through 14. 
Safety Assessments  
Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_547994] (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), laboratory 
evaluation of hematology, biochemistry, and urinalysis  values, measurement of weight and vital signs, 
evaluation of ECGs, and the performance of physical examinations.  
Subjects will be queried for spontaneously reported AE s at each study visit, before assessment of local 
skin reactions (LSRs).  AEs will be re ported separately from LSRs. 
Subject -reported LSRs will not be reported as adverse events.  
Other Assessments  
The LSR assessment is the Investigator’s (or trained designee ’s) assessment of the following signs on the 
treatment area:  erythema, flaking/scaling, crusting, swelling, vesiculation/pustulation, and erosion/ulceration.  These signs will be assessed using a grading scale ranging from 0 (not present)  
to 4 (worst).
  In addition to LSRs, hypo- and hyper- pi [INVESTIGATOR_547982].  Application site reactions not classified as LSRs (eg, pruritus, 
pain, infection) will be reported as adverse events.   All application site reactions and LSRs will be 
followed to resolution, or if resolution i s unlikely, to stabilization.  LSRs will be reported separately from 
AEs.  
Standardized photography will be performed at Screening (Visit 1), Day 1 (Visit 2), Day 8 (Visit 7), 
Day 57 (Visit 10), and during the Recurrence Follow-up (at 3, 6, 9, and [ADDRESS_717319]- Day 57).  Before

Not applicable  
Bioanalytical Methods 
Plasma concentrations of study drug will be measured using a validated liquid chromatography/tandem 
mass spectrometry (LC -MS/MS) assay. 
Statistical Methods 
Study Endpoints  
Primary Endpoint  
x Activity will be evaluated by [CONTACT_547995].  Complete response rate will be defined as 
the proportion of subjects achieving 100% complete clearance of all treated AK lesions on the face 
or scalp at Day 57.  Sustained response will be defined a s the proportion of subjects achieving 100% 
(complete) clearance at Day [ADDRESS_717320]-Day 57. 
Secondary Endpoints  
• Activity:   Reduction in lesion counts during Days 1-57 
• Safety:  Evaluation of AEs and clinical laboratory data ; the results of other safety assessments (vital 
signs, physical examinations, ECGs) will also be evaluated. 
• Pharmacokinetic:  Determination of C max,  and where applicable, AUC t, C min, and accumulation  
ratio R 
Exploratory Endpoint 
• Recurrence rate will be defined as the proportion of subjects who achieved 100% complete clearance 
at Day 57 (Visit 10) with any identified AK lesions on the face or scalp at 3, 6, 9, and [ADDRESS_717321]-Day 57. 
Analysis Sets  
• Per-Protocol Set:  the group of protocol- eligible subjects who receive [ADDRESS_717322]-treatment evaluation. 
• Evaluable Set:  the group of subjects who receive [ADDRESS_717323] evaluations 
including the Day 57 Follow-up Visit. 
• Safety Analysis/Full Analysis Set:  the group of subjects who receive at least one dose of study 
treatment. 
• PK Analysis Set: the group of subjects who receive study treatment and complete at least one 
scheduled post-treatment PK evaluation. 
Activity Analyses  
AK lesion counts will be summarized at Day 1 (pre treatment) and at each subsequent timepoint for 
subjects in the Full Analysis Set  and the Per-Protocol Set. 
A 95% confidence interval (CI) for th e complete clearance (response rate) at  Day [ADDRESS_717324] one dose of KX2-391 Ointment 1% will be included in the safety 
analyses.  Treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) are defined as either those AEs with an onset after dosing or 
those pre -existing AEs that worsen after dosing.  For AEs, verbatim terms on the case report 
form/electronic case report form ( CRF/eCRF) will be mapped to preferred terms (PTs) and system organ 
classes (SOCs) using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA; v 16. 0 or higher).  
Subject incidence of AEs will be displayed by [CONTACT_2946].  Adverse events will also be summarized by [CONTACT_548037].  Subject incidence of SAEs will also be displayed.  Laboratory parameters will be summarized using descriptive statistics at ba seline and at each subsequent timepoint.  Changes 
from baseline will also be summarized.  In addition, shift tables (ie, low
-normal- high at baseline versus 
low-normal-high at follow-up in a 3-by- 3 contingency table) will be provided to assess changes in 
labora tory values from baseline to follow-up. 
Local skin reactions, pi[INVESTIGATOR_371], and scarring as reported by [CONTACT_737], will be displayed and 
summarized by [CONTACT_548038].  
Pharmacokinetic, Pharmacodynamic, Pharmacogenomic, and Other Biomarker Ana lyses 
Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
Plasma concentrations for KX2 -[ADDRESS_717325] de viation (SD), median, minimum, and maximum.  
Categorical variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_374560].  All raw data obtained from the CRF/eCRF, as well as any derived data will be included in data listings.
 
Sample Size Rationale 
A sample size of [ADDRESS_717326] a 100% complete clearance rate at Day 57 greater than 
20% with 80% power, based on a two -sided (alpha=0.05) binomial test, assuming a response rate of 35%, 
and less than a 25% dropout rate.  This corresponds to a two -sided 95% CI with a half-width of less th an 
15% (ie, lower boundary of the CI above 20%).

7 INTRODUCTION 
7.1 Indication 
In this study, the activity, safety, and pharm acokinetics (PK) of KX2-391 Ointment 1% will 
be evaluated in adult subjects with a clinical diagnosis of stable, clinically typi[INVESTIGATOR_547931] (AK) on the face or scalp.

 7.1.1 Mechanism of Action 
KX2-391 (also referred to as KX01) is a synt hetic and highly selective inhibitor of Src 
tyrosine kinase signaling and tubulin polymer ization. KX2-[ADDRESS_717339] overall response in these early studies has been ‘stable disease’ 
in 25-30% of patients.   
KX2-391 promotes the induction of p53, G2/M arrest of proliferating cell populations and 
subsequent apoptosis via the stimulation of Ca spase-[ADDRESS_717340] clinical activity in dermatology indications 
such as actinic keratosis.  Potent inhibition of the growth of primary human keratinocytes and 
several melanoma cell lines in vitro (50% growth inhibition [GI
50 values] ≤50 nM), suggests 
that KX2-391 has the potential to inhibit the proliferative expansion and promote apoptosis 
of abnormally proliferating cells in the epi[INVESTIGATOR_547932]. 
KX2-391 has also been observed to inhibit T cell migration and endothelial tubule formation 
in vitro, suggesting additional potential therapeutic benefits for conditions where pathology is supported by [CONTACT_548004], inflammation, and/or angiogenesis. 
Information regarding KX2- 391 nonclinical studies is provided in the Investigator’s 
Brochure. 
7.1.2 Clinical Experience with 
KX2-391  
KX2-391 Ointment 1% has been administered  to humans in ongoing study KX01-AK-01-
US.  Based on preliminary PK data from this study in AK lesions on the forearm, the systemic exposure to KX2-[ADDRESS_717341] ication site reactions and systemic toxicity. 
KX2-391 has been administered orally to a pproximately 120 patients with malignancy. 
The Kinex studies of oral KX2-391 are as follows: 
KX2-391 was evaluated in a Phase I clinical trial, Study No. KX01-01- 07, entitled “A 
Combined Rising Single-Dose (RSD) and Rising Multiple-Dose (RMD) Phase I Study to Evaluate Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacoki netics of KX2-391 in Patients with Advanced 
Malig nancies That Are Refractory to Conventional Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]”.  
KX2-391 has been evaluated in Study No. KX01-002- 09, entitled “A Phase II, Open -Label, 
Single-Arm Study Evaluating the Safety, Ef ficacy and Pharmacokinetics of KX2-[ADDRESS_717342] Not Received 
Prior Chemotherapy.”  
KX2-391 was evaluated in Study No, KX01-03- 11, “A Phase 1b Rising Multiple -Dose 
Clinical Study to Evaluate Safety, Tolerability  and Activity of Oral Monotherapy with KX2-
391 in Elderly Subjects with Acute Myeloi d Leukemia (AML) Who Are Refractory to or 
Have Declined Standard Induction Therapy”.  
7.2 Study Rationale 
Actinic keratoses represent the initial intra- epi[INVESTIGATOR_547976] (SCC).  Squamous 
cell carcinoma is the second leading cause of skin cancer deaths in the US, with up to 65% of 
SCC arising from pre-existing actinic keratoses.2,3  The risk of progression has been 
determined to be between  0.025% and 16% per year,2,4 and the calculated lifetime risk of 
malignant transformation for a patient with AK s followed up for 10 years is between 6.1% 
and 10.2%.5  The rationale behind treating every AK is  based on the difficulty in predicting 
which single AK will progress to squamous cell carcinoma.6,7  Suchniak et al8 reported 36% 
of lesions previously diagnosed clinically as AKs being in fact SCC, with 14% being in situ SCC.  Ehrig et al
9 showed that 4% of AKs clinically diagnosed by [CONTACT_17685]-certified 
dermatologists were in fact SCC and 5% were  considered occult early stage of cutaneous 
malignancy.  Spontaneous regression has been  reported in up to 25.9% of AKs over a 
12-month period, although 15% later reappeared.10,11,[ADDRESS_717343] cosmetically acceptable 
outcomes.  Current approved/marketed trea tment has shown up to approximately 60% 
efficacy, with a recurrence rate of approximately 35%.

9 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 
9.1 Overall Study Design and Plan 
This study will be an open-label, multicenter, activity, safety, tolerability, and PK study of 
KX2-391 Ointment 1% administered topi[INVESTIGATOR_547983]. 
The study consists of Screening, Treatment, and Follow-up Periods. 
Eligible subjects will receive 5 consecutive days  of topi[INVESTIGATOR_35786], to be applied at the 
study site, with 50 mg of KX2-391 Ointment 1% each day.  Blood samples for PK analysis will be collected on Day 1 and Day 5.  Subjects will return for Follow-up visits until Day 57.  
Thereafter, only Day 57 complete responders w ill continue Recurrence Follow-up Visits 
every 3 months for an additional 12 months afte r Day 57.  Activity (lesion counts) and safety 
evaluations will be performed. 
On Day 1 (Visit 2) and Day 5 (Visit 6), subject s will stay for approximately [ADDRESS_717345] dose of study drug.  All screening assessments/evaluations, as 
presented in Table [ADDRESS_717346] provides informed consent and

 The location and approximate shape of the treatm ent area will be recorded on the appropriate 
body chart. 
At Visit 1, the Investigator and an investigational center staff member will identify the 
treatment area by:  
x Examining the face or scalp and locating each AK with a dot of removable surgical 
skin marker. 
x Using an [ADDRESS_717347] 2 anatomical landmarks on the acetate sheet.  Example of landmarks 
could be bony prominences, scars, moles, seborrheic keratosis, and veins. 
x Indicating location of AK lesions with permanent marker dots on transparency acetate 
sheet. 
x Removing surgical skin mar ker dots with alcohol swabs. 
x Outlining the treatment area on the face or scalp with a fine-tipped indelible marker. 
9.1.2 Treatment Period 
The inclusion/exclusion criteria will be review ed again prior to treatment on Day 1, to 
re-confirm subjects’ eligibility to participate in the study . 
Subjects will be treated for 5 consecutive da ys (Days 1-5 [Visits 2-6]) during the Treatment 
Period.  Visits 2 through 6 should be scheduled to occur at approximately the same time each 
day. 
At Visit 2 (Day 1), prior to study drug application, the Investigator and any appropriate 
investigational staff member(s) (Investigator-tra ined designee) will confirm the location of 
the treatment area using the Visit 1 acetate sh eet and the body charts.  The Investigator 
should re-mark the treatment area borders as needed so the study evaluations may be 
effectively completed. 
Once the treatment area has been re-ident ified at Visit 2, photographs will be taken

Not applicable 
 Safety Assessments 
Safety assessments will include recording all AEs and serious adverse events (SAEs). 
Safety assessments also include laboratory evaluation of hematology, biochemistry, and 
urinalyses; periodic measurement of weight, vita l signs, ECGs, and performance of PEs, as 
detailed in the sections below and shown in  Table [ADDRESS_717370]-reported LSRs will not be reported as adverse events.  Treatments administered for 
LSRs will be recorded on the Concomitant Medications CRF. 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_717371].  For this study, the study drug is KX2-391 Ointment 1%. 
Treatment-emergent AEs are defined as: 
x either those AEs with an onset after dosing or  
x those pre-existing conditions that worsen after dosing 
The criteria for identifying AEs are: 
• any unfavorable and unintended sign (incl uding an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated wi th the use of an investigational product, 
whether or not considered related to the investigational product 
• any new disease or exacerbation of an existing disease  
Clinical Study Protocol KX01-AK-002 
 
 
Kinex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
FINAL v1.0_23 Jan 2016  Page 33  
CONFIDENTIAL 
 • any deterioration in nonprotocol-required mea surements of a laboratory value or other 
clinical test (eg, ECG or x-ray) that result s in symptoms, a change in treatment, or 
discontinuation from study drug 
• recurrence of an intermittent medical conditi on (eg, headache) not present at baseline 
All AEs, regardless of relationship to study drug  or procedure, should be collected beginning 
from the time the subject signs the study IC F through the final contact [CONTACT_548013]-up 
Period.   For subjects participating in the Recurren ce Follow-up Period, only AEs at the 
treatment area will be collecte d.  Subjects who fail screening primarily due to AE(s) must 
have the AE(s) leading to screen failure reported on the Screening Disposition CRF/eCRF. 
Subjects with onset of an AE  or deterioration of a pre-exist ing condition will be followed 
until resolution, resolved with sequelae, or under  medical care.  All SAEs must be followed 
to resolution or, if resolution is unlikely, to stabilization. 
All AEs observed during the study will be reported on the CRF/eCRF. 
Laboratory Adverse Events 
A treatment-emergent abnormal laboratory test re sult should be considered as a treatment-
emergent AE (TEAE) if the identified labor atory abnormality leads to any type of 
intervention whether prescribed in the protocol or not. 
An abnormal laboratory result should be considered by [CONTACT_548014]: 
x results in the withdrawal of study drug 
x results in withholding of study drug pending some investigational outcome 
x results in the initiation of an inte rvention, based on medical evaluation (eg, 
potassium supplement for hypokalemia) 
x results in any out of range laboratory value that in the Investigator ’s judgment 
fulfills the definitions of an AE with regard to the subject ’s medical profile  
x increases in severity compared with baseline 
Abnormal laboratory values should not be listed as  separate AEs if they are considered to be 
part of the clinical syndrome that is being reported  as an AE.  It is the responsibility of the 
Investigator to review all laboratory findings in  all subjects and determine if they constitute 
an AE.  Medical and scientific judgment should be  exercised in deciding whether an isolated 
laboratory abnormality should be classified  as an AE.  Any laboratory abnormality 
considered to constitute an AE should be reported on the Adverse Event CRF/eCRF. 
ECG changes and associated clinical symptoms determined to be clinically significant by [CONTACT_548015].  An ECG abnormality in a subject with symptoms may meet the criteria for an AE as described in this protocol.  In these instances, the AE 
corresponding to the symptomatic ECG abnormality will be recorded on the Adverse Events 
CRF/eCRF. 
Clinical Study Protocol KX01-AK-[ADDRESS_717372] submit an 
SAE report, including the ECG report to the Sponsor, or designee, using the SAE reporting 
procedures ( Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
Assessing Severity of Adverse Events 
Every effort must be made by [CONTACT_548016].  
Adverse events will be graded for severity as follows: 
Mild An event that is easily tolerated by  [CONTACT_102], causing minimal discomfort 
and not interfering with everyday activities 
Moderate An event that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with everyday 
activities 
Severe An event that prevents normal everyday activities  
Investigators will assess severity for all AEs (f or both increasing and decreasing severity).  
The criteria for assessing severity are different from those used for seriousness (see Section [IP_ADDRESS].2 ). 
Assessing Relationship to Study Treatment 
Items to be considered when assessing the re lationship of an AE to the study treatment are: 
x temporal relationship of the onset of the event to the initiation of the study treatment 
x the course of the event, especially the effe ct of discontinuation of study treatment or 
reintroduction of study treatment, as applicable 
x whether the event is known to be associated  with the study treatment or with other 
similar treatments 
x the presence of risk factors in the study s ubject known to increase the occurrence of 
the event 
x the presence of nonstudy treatment-related factors that are known to be associated 
with the occurrence of the event 
Classification of Causality 
The relationship of each AE to the study drug will be recorded on the CRF/eCRF using the 
following criteria: 
Definitely Related:   A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, occurring in a 
plausible time relationship to drug administ ration, and which cannot be explained by

 Probably Related:   A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable 
time sequence to administration of the drug, unl ikely to be attributed to concurrent or 
underlying disease or other drugs or conditions  
Possibly Related:   A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable 
time sequence to administration of the drug, but which could also be explained by [CONTACT_548018]:   A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a temporal

• results in death 
• is life-threatening (ie, the s ubject was at immediate risk of death from the AE as it 
occurred; this does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form or 
was allowed to continue, might have caused death) 
• requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
• is a congenital anomaly/birth defect (in th e child of a subject who was exposed to the 
study drug) 
Other important medical events that may not be  immediately life-threatening or result in 
death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], when based on appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to pre vent one of the outcomes in the definition of 
SAE listed above should also be considered SAEs.  Medical and scientific judgment should 
be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in such situations. 
In addition to the above, other events of in terest, which include pregnancy, overdose, and 
significant treatment-emergent laboratory abnormality (See Section [IP_ADDRESS].1 ), are to be 
captured using the SAE procedures but are to be considered as SAEs only if they met one of the above criteria. All events of these types are to be reported on the CRF/eCRF whether or not they meet the criteria for SAEs.

Standardized Photography 
Standardized photography will be performed at Screening (Visit 1), Day 1 (Visit 2), Day 8 
(Visit 7), Day 57 (Visit 10), and during the Recurrence Follow-up (at 3, 6, 9, and [ADDRESS_717378]-Day 57).  Before study medication application on Day 1, the Investigator or a qualified staff member must obtain standardized photograph y of each subject’s treatment area before 
application of study medication. 
Care must be taken to ensure the same ligh ting, background, subject positioning relative to 
the camera and camera settings are used for  each photograph.  Equipment, supplies and 
detailed instructions for obtaining and managin g the photographs will be provided to the 
investigational center prior to the initiation of subject enrollment. 
The photographs are to document the appearance of the subjects’ treatment area and to assist 
with the identification and confirmation of the location of the treatment area throughout the 
study ( Section 9.1.1 ). 
Equipment, supplies and detailed instructions for obtaining and managing the photographs 
will be provided to the investigational center prior to the initiation of subject enrollment.  
9.5.[ADDRESS_717379], will be collected (ie, Day 57 plus 30 days).  These SAEs will be discussed in the 
clinical study report.  Any SAE event judged by [CONTACT_548042]. 
Deaths and life-threatening events should be  reported immediately by [CONTACT_756].  The 
immediate report should be followed up within [ADDRESS_717380] information for reporting of SAEs is provided in the Safety 
Management Plan, located in the Investigator File. 
It is very important that the SAE report form be  filled out as completely as possible at the 
time of the initial report. This includes the Investigator ’s assessment of causality.  All 
supporting documents should be sent de-identified and should contain the assigned subject number. Send only supporting documents directly related to the event. 
Any follow-up information received on SAEs should be forwarded within 1 business day of 
its receipt.  If the follow-up information changes the Investigator ’s assessment of causality, 
this should also be noted on the follow-up SAE form. 
Preliminary SAE reports should be followed as soon as possible by [CONTACT_3582][INVESTIGATOR_3103], autops y reports, and other documents requested by 
[CONTACT_1034]. 
 Reporting of Pregnancy and Exposure to Study Drug through Breastfeeding 
Any pregnancy for which the estimated date of c onception was either before the last visit or 
within [ADDRESS_717381] be reported. 
If an adverse outcome of a pregnancy is suspected to be related to study drug exposure, this 
should be reported regardless of the length of ti me that has passed since the exposure to study 
treatment. 
A congenital anomaly, death during perinatal period, an induced abortion, or a spontaneous 
abortion are considered to be an SAE and should  be reported in the same timeframe and in 
the same format as all other SAEs (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
Pregnancies must be reported by [CONTACT_548035] 
[ADDRESS_717382] 
[IP_ADDRESS].1 R EPORTING OF ADVERSE EVENTS ASSOCIATED WITH STUDY DRUG OVERDOSE , 
MISUSE , ABUSE , OR MEDICATION ERROR  
Study drug overdose is defined as the accidental or intentional use of the drug in an amount 
higher than the dose being studied. 
Any study drug overdose should be noted on the Study Medication CRF/eCRF. All AEs associated with overdose, or medicati on error should be captured on the Adverse 
Event CRF/eCRF and also reported using the procedures detailed in Section [IP_ADDRESS] even if 
the AEs do not meet serious criteria.  If th e AE associated with an overdose or medication 
error does not meet serious criteria, it must still be reported using the SAE form and in an 
expedited manner but should be noted as nonserious on the SAE form and the Adverse Event CRF/eCRF. 
 Expedited Reporting 
The Sponsor (or its designee) must inform In vestigators and regulatory authorities of 
reportable events, in compliance with appli cable regulatory requirements, on an expedited 
basis (ie, within specific timeframes).  For th is reason, it is imperative that sites provide 
complete SAE information in the manner described above. 
In determining what SAEs meet criteria for ex pedited reporting, the current version of the 
Investigator ’s Br ochure will be used for reference safety information.

designed to improve motor recovery and patient education after stroke. A minimum of 124 subjects (the number may be larger depending on the rate of subject dropout) with arm motor 
deficits 4-36 weeks after a stroke due to i schemia or to intracerebral hemorrhage will be 
randomized to receive 6 weeks of intensive arm motor therapy (a) in a traditional in-clinic setting or (b) via in-home telerehabilitation (rehabilitation services delivered to the subject’s home via an internet-connected computer).  The intensity, duration, and frequency of this therapy will be identical across the two groups, with subjects in both treatment arms receiving 36 sessions (18 
supervised and 18 unsupervised), 80 minutes each (including a 10 minute break), over [ADDRESS_92239] change in the arm motor Fugl-Meyer (FM) score from the Baseline Visit to [ADDRESS_92240] will perform all study testing, blinded to treatment assignment (the subject by [CONTACT_84631]) , while a Treatment Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_84579]-clinic therapy as well as direct home-based 
telerehabilitation. Potential enrollees may be identified through any of several routes, for example, during the acute stroke admission at the clinical site or a referral hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], during inpatient rehabilitation at the clinical site or a referral hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], or through other means of community-based recruitment. Study conduct will be highly standardized, including selecting therapy content, delivering therapy, and testing.  
The current study aims to critically evaluate the utility of a telehealth approach to motor 
therapy and stroke education. Telehealth has enormous potential to address unmet needs in the growing population of stroke survivors.

  1. SPECIFIC AIMS/OBJECTIVES -  
1.1. Specific Aim 1. Arm Motor Recovery :  
Arm motor deficits are common after stroke, ar e strongly linked to disability and well being 
after stroke, and thus are the primary endpoint of this study. Aim [ADDRESS_92241] the hypothesis that subjects randomized to telerehabilitation will show significant arm motor gains, and that these 
gains will not be inferior to those achieved by  [CONTACT_84632]. 
1.1.1 Primary Outcome:   The primary endpoint is within-subject change in the arm 
motor Fugl-Meyer (FM) score from the Baseline Visit to the 30 Day Follow Up Visit. 1.1.2 Secondary Outcomes of Arm Motor Recovery : Two secondary endpoints will be 
examined, representing additional dimensions of motor recovery. 
- (1) Within-subject change in Box & Blocks score from the Screening Visit to the 
30 Day Follow Up Visit 
- (2) Within-subject change in Stroke Impact Scale-Hand Domain score from the 
Baseline Visit to the 30 Day Follow Up Visit 
1.2 Specific Aim 2. Secondary Outcomes--Stroke Education and Prevention :  
Many patients with stroke know little about the causes of their condition and consequently 
have poor control of stroke-related risk factors. Improving patient knowledge about stroke can therefore help to prevent stroke recurrence and to optimize patient outcomes. While all certified stroke centers include patient education as a priority during the acute stroke admission, patients and their families may not be in the best position to benefit from such education at this time as 
compared to once they have returned to their home.  Aim [ADDRESS_92242]-Therapy Visit among subjects using the 
telerehabilitation system will be comparable to the change in percentage of questions 
answered correctly on the Stroke Education Exam among subjects using a traditional paper booklet-based method. B.1.3  Increased stroke knowledge will be positively correlated with improvement in 
weight and blood pressure control. 
1.3 Specific Aim 3. Patient Compliance with and Motivation for Therapy :  
A major issue in rehabilitation therapy is patient compliance. Compliance and its variance 
across patients will be examined by [CONTACT_84633].  Aim [ADDRESS_92243] 40 minutes, will be 
comparable or better with telerehabilitation as compared to compliance with in-clinic therapy. 1.3.2 Activity-inherent motivation, which reflects how much a patient enjoys a therapy 
and defined as the change in score on the Physical Activity Enjoyment (PACES) Scale 
TeleRehab  CONFIDENTIAL   April 21, [ADDRESS_92244] as high (and in 
many patients higher) with telerehabilitati on as compared to in-clinic therapy. 
1.33 Level of consequence-related motivation, which reflects the patient’s degree of 
dedication to treatment goals and defined as the score on the Optimization in Primary 
and Secondary Control (OPS) Scale at the Baseline Visit, will emerge as a significant predictor of compliance in both groups, even after controlling for key variables. When consequence-related motivation is high, compliance will be high, for both treatment groups. When consequence-related motivation is low, compliance may be lower but will vary with the level of activity-inherent motivation. 
 
2. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE   
 2.1 Rational and Supporting Data:  
The burden of stroke disability is high and increasing.  
There are >795,[ADDRESS_92245] (>90%) patients survive the 
acute epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], living an average of 6-7 additional years
1.  There are >7,000,[ADDRESS_92246] disability-adjusted life years4.  This issue is increasing in 
magnitude:  advances in stroke medicine are pr oducing a sharp increase in the fraction of 
patients surviving the acute stroke, and so the burden of stroke disability will likely increase over 
time5. Consistent with this, Edwards et al found that significantly more individuals with stroke 
reported less dexterity and cognitive impairment in [ADDRESS_92247] common deficits after stroke are in the motor system, present in >80% of patients 
initially.  Between 55% and 75% of patients have enduring motor deficits, which are associated with reduced quality of life
8-10.  Arm motor deficits are of particular importance:  65% of patients 
at [ADDRESS_92248] charged that emerging reducti ons in duration of rehabilitation is limiting 
patient gains26,18.  In other cases, patients (e.g., in rural areas) cannot get to a rehabilitation 
therapy provider because it is too far from t heir home, or because of regional shortages of 
rehabilitation care27.  Cost-effective methods are needed to provide more rehabilitation therapy 
at higher intensities to patients wherever they live.   Stroke patients lack key knowledge and this affects their outcomes .  
Compounding these issues is the overall modest control of stroke risk factors among 
survivors of stroke. At a time when patients are trying to recover and maintain function, many fail to control stroke risk factors.  Risk factor control can prevent further vascular injury, recurrent stroke, myocardial infarction and progression of peripheral vascular disease--conditions that can have a large bearing on outcome after stroke.  For example, the NHANES III study found that in 
1,252 U.S. survivors of MI or stroke, blood pressure was controlled in only 53%; blood sugar, in 
only 50%; and blood cholesterol, in only 46%
28.  While these results may be due to multiple 
factors, a likely contributor is that patients with stroke have limited knowledge about their condition.  For example, 39% of ER patients with possible stroke could not name 1 sign or symptom of stroke in one study
29, and 40% of patients with stroke could not identify even a 
single stroke risk factor30.  Limited financial resources, time, and distance limit participation in 
educational programs in patients with neurological disease31. Yet this issue is of particular 
importance after stroke, as [ADDRESS_92249] a recurrent stroke32, which often 
introduces further disability.  Education that im proves awareness of control of modifiable stroke 
risk factors can improve risk factor  control in patients with stroke33-35. Attention to stroke 
education can maximize behavioral gains from a stroke telehealth system36, 37.  Education of 
patients with stroke helps improve function and risk factor control, and thereby [CONTACT_84634], and so is also a key focus in the current study Telerehabilitation may be able to overcome some of the current limitations .  
Telerehabilitation has been defined as “the delivery of rehabilitation services via information 
and communication technologies.” Clinically, this term encompasses a range of rehabilitation 
and habilitation services that include assessment , monitoring, prevention, intervention, 
supervision, education, consultation, and counseling….”
38. Increasing evidence supports the 
potential of a telerehabilitation approach for reducing neurological deficits39-45. A major 
component of this may be derived from the use of games to promote patient participation in health care
46-50.  Games can motivate patients to engage in enjoyable play behavior which 
involves therapeutically relevant movements51, 52.  In addition, advances have been made using 
remote methods to improve function after stroke40, 53-55, including motor function specifically39, 41, 
43. 
Motivation . 
A major challenge facing long-term rehabilitation care is to maintain patient motivation and 
engagement with physiotherapy.  For example, 60-76% of patients do not adhere to a home-
based physiotherapy treatment plan56-58.  Even the best rehabilitation system will achieve little 
reduction in disability if not used.  Successful rehabilitation interventions after stroke are strongly associated with high patient motivation
59. We will examine compliance in relation to two forms of 
motivation60: 
1. Activity-inherent motivation, which reflects  how much a patient likes or dislikes the 
activity itself, independent of his or her commitment to the treatment goals. 
2. Consequence-related motivation, which reflects the patient’s level of motivational 
commitment to treatment goals. 
TeleRehab  CONFIDENTIAL   April 21, [ADDRESS_92250] been voiced with stroke telerehabilitation studies to date .  
 Recent reviews of telerehabilitation provide useful points for designing a study of stroke telerehabilitation. A 2011 systematic review of stroke telerehabilitation
55 criticized the quality of 
published studies.  Of 9 studies identified, only 4 were randomized controlled trials.  On the 
positive side:  “Home-based telerehabilitati on interventions showed promising results in 
improving the health of stroke patients...Health professionals and participants reported high levels of satisfaction and acceptance of telerehabilitation interventions
55.”  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_6831], the 
quality of the evidence was deemed “low”. In particular, sample sizes have been small, a control group was often not included, duration of follow-up was often brief, and most enrollees had mild 
deficits
10, 55, 61, 62--the latter being a perennial problem for stroke research63.  Few randomized 
controlled trials in stroke rehabilitation have considered compliance among their outcome measures
32. 
Guidance for stroke telerehabilitation design .  
 In addition to the above lessons, guidance for design of telerehabilitation comes from the 
2008 Agency for Healthcare Research & Quality (AHRQ) report “Barriers and Drivers of Health 
Information Technology Use for the Elderly, Chr onically Ill, and Underserved, which emphasized 
the importance of patient convenience, ease of use, frequent interactions with a clinician, and provision of feedback
64; the value of feedback in stroke rehabilitation has also been emphasized 
by [CONTACT_84635]65. These points guided the design of the trial's telerehabilitation system, and 
might explain the high compliance (97.9%) and low dropout (0%) in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] (see Section 
III.C.). A 2012 report from the Institute of Medicine on telemedicine noted that “Some applications of telemedicine show great progress, but other areas lack large studies.”  This report lauded the use of “matched control groups” and incorporation of “best practices into teletherapy content.”
66.  Arsand et al67 noted that many telehealth applications have not been 
“evaluated for their effectiveness in motivating or changing users’ self-management behaviors.” 
Motivation is key to changing patient habits, patterns, and outcomes, and is the centerpi[INVESTIGATOR_84580] 3. An overview of stroke rehab ilitation from the American Heart Association noted 
that “interventions in which a variety of arm and hand movements are practiced have resulted in increased motor control and/or use of the paretic upper extremity in daily life tasks.”
32.  Each of 
these points informs the current study. 
Telerehabilitation and context-specific training .  
 A potential advantage of telerehabilitation is that care is provided in a favorable context, and this might promote self-management.  A core principle noted in occupational therapy practice guidelines is that performance after stroke is  significantly influenced by [CONTACT_84636]
68. Telerehabilitation provides therapy in the patient’s home and so builds on this 
principle59, 69, 70. Furthermore, this approach can promote self-managed care69 and thereby 
[CONTACT_84637]67; note too that a study from co-investigator Heckhausen et al in patients with 
recent stroke or myocardial infarct found that patients engaged in their own improvement had a major survival advantage
71. These points are supported by a meta-analysis of day hospi[INVESTIGATOR_19161]. 
in-home care, which, while noting the limited amount of available data, found day hospi[INVESTIGATOR_84581].  The authors called for further randomized 
trials that “focus on comparing services which aim to provide an equivalent intervention.
72” 
3. PRELIMINARY STUDIES    
 A pi[INVESTIGATOR_84582] 12 subjects with chronic stroke, using entry criteria 
similar to the current proposal, each of w hom received 28 days of home telerehabilitation 
targeting arm motor deficits. At baseline, age was 54±16 (mean±SD; range 26-75) yr, gender 
TeleRehab  CONFIDENTIAL   April 21, 2016 
 
 
 9  
  
  6M/6F, time post-stroke 7±6 mo, and arm motor Fugl- Meyer (FM) score was 39±12 (range 23-
56). The main results were that: 
 Compliance was excellent 
o Subjects engaged in therapy 329 of 336 (97.9%) assigned days without 
dropout. 
o Verizon wireless USB modem reception was present in all patient’s homes. 
o Subjects rated the experience very favorably via Likert scales. 
 Arm motor status was significantly improved 
o Total FM score increased by 4.8 ± 3.8 points (p=0.0015). 
o Significant increases found in both proximal and distal FM subscores. 
 Gains in knowledge about stroke prevention were significant and specific to 
the practiced materials 
o For questions practiced daily, scores in creased 39% (22.8 to 31.7 out of 40, 
p=0.0007). 
 Findings were not dependent on computer skills 
o Computer literacy scores, measured with the Computer–Email–Web Fluency 
Scale73, declined with age (r = -0.90 to -0.92, p<0.0001), as expected, but were 
not related to gains in arm motor control or stroke knowledge. 
 Validated remote screening for depression after stroke 
o Telehealth scoring of PHQ-9 (r=0.72, p=0.008) and PHQ-2 (r=0.94, p<0.0001) 
were validated. 
 Subjects have poor recall of their recent usage and performance statistics 
o Subjects were regularly asked to recall their scores and usage from the prior 
day, and whether these had changed. Their recall was not significantly related to actual values. 
This pi[INVESTIGATOR_84583]-based telerehabilitation is feasible in patients with recent 
stroke, indeed here being associated with 97. 9% compliance. This approach significantly 
improved arm motor status, with average gains exceeding the minimal clinically important 
difference of 4.[ADDRESS_92251]. Cramer is a Professor of Neurology and Anatomy & Neurobiology at UC Irvine.  He is 
also interim Director of the UC Irvine Stroke & Cerebrovascular Center, the Vice Chair for Research in the Dept. Neurology, the Clinical Director of the Stem Cell Research Center, and 
the Associate Director of the UC Irvine CTSA (Institute for Clinical & Translational Science). He is board certified in Neurology and in Vascular Neurology. His research focuses on brain repair 
after central nervous system injury in humans, with an emphasis on recovery of movement after 
stroke.  [CONTACT_84675] has extensive experience runn ing trials of restorative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_84584], including investigations of ropi[INVESTIGATOR_11122]

at the journal Stroke , and is the author of over [ADDRESS_92253] the effectivene ss of a novel home-based telehealth system 
designed to improve motor recovery and patient education after stroke. A total of 124 subjects with arm motor deficits 4-36 weeks after a stroke due to ischemia or to intracerebral hemorrhage will be randomized to receive 6 weeks of intensive arm motor therapy (a) in a 
traditional in-clinic setting –Standard therapy arm or (b) via in-home telerehabilitation 
(rehabilitation services delivered to the subject’s home via an internet-connected computer) -Investigational arm.  The intensity, duration, and frequency of this therapy will be identical across the two groups, with subjects in both treatment arms receiving 36 sessions (18 supervised and 18 unsupervised), 80 minutes each (including a 10 minute break), over 6 weeks. Arm motor status is the focus here because it is commonly affected by [CONTACT_84639], is of central 
importance to many human functions, and is strongly linked to disability and well being after 
stroke. 
 5.2. Randomization 
 A web-based central randomization system developed by [CONTACT_84640] (NDMC) and installed on the WebDCU
TM Telerehabilitation Study website. 
Subjects will be assigned to one of the treatment groups according to the randomization 
scheme developed at the NDMC. Randomization will be done centrally using the WebDCUTM for 
all subjects entered in the trial. Covariate-adaptive randomization will be used to insure that values for (1) number of days post-stroke at time of randomization (2) FM score at the baseline visit, and (3) site are balanced across the two treatment groups.

since the time of stroke onset and prior and concomitant medications will be documented. Note 
that the Screening Visit assessments, with the exception of the Fugl-Meyer test, may be completed thereafter up to and including at the Baseline Visit. This is not encouraged but it is recognized that this may be useful for selected patients.   Subjects deemed eligible at the end of Screening Visit will be given the time and date of the Baseline Visit. 
 Subjects who are found not to be eligible at this visit will be invited to return to be re-
screened, e.g., in 1 month, provided the window for eligibility will still be open and providing that the basis for non-eligibility is potentially resolvable.

use of specific study protocols, which are modeled after two main sources:  Upper-Extremity 
Task-Specific Training After Stroke or Disability  (Lang and Birkenmeier) 
[ADDRESS_92266].  All activities during the 6 weeks of therapy (treatment supervision, assessments, education) will be perfor med/overseen by [CONTACT_84641]’s Treatment 
Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]; the site’s Assessment Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_84586] [ADDRESS_92267], as reasonably possible.   
 Within 10 days of the Baseline Visit (target value < 5 days), all subjects will begin a 6-week 
regimen of study-designated intensive arm motor therapy (in-clinic vs. telerehabilitation). Prior to the first day of therapy, the Treatment Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] w ill use the study manual of procedures to plan 
the specific content and details of therapy, incorporating subject data acquired at the Screening and Baseline Visits.  The Treatment Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_84587]

Therapy:   
 During each of the ensuing six weeks, all subjects will receive 6 therapy sessions/week, [ADDRESS_92268] will therefore 
receive a total of 36 therapy sessions , consisting of 18 supervised therapy sessions  
(Monday/Wednesday/Friday, when possible) and 18 unsupervised therapy sessions  
(Tuesday/Thursday/Saturday, when possible) as par t of study participation.  Each treatment

  5.3.[ADDRESS_92279]-Therapy Visit 
 Immediately after the end of therapy (1-[ADDRESS_92280] day of therapy, target value = 2 
days), the subject will return to the central study site for testing. The study site will call the 
subject the day before this visit, reminding him/her of the time and place of the visit.  All testing 
during the Post-Therapy Visit will be performed by [CONTACT_84641]’s Assessment Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437], who 
will remain blinded to treatment assignment. To further protect the blinding of the Assessing Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541], subjects will be reminded not to discuss with the Assessment Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_84591].  The assessments to be performed include FM Scale

7. CRITERIA FOR PREMATURE STUDY TERMINATION 
 
Subject Removal from Therapy:   
As participation in the “Telerehabilitation in the Home versus Therapy In-Clinic for Patients 
with Stroke” trial is voluntary, the subject may decline study therapy at any time. In addition, the treating investigator may stop study therapy if there is a safety concern.  In either case, the 
subject will continue to be followed through the [ADDRESS_92284] Withdrawal:    
 The subject has the right to voluntarily withdr aw from the study at any time for any reason 
without prejudice to his/her future medical care by [CONTACT_8018].  For the 
occasional subject who withdraws consent, the date and reason for consent withdrawal should 
be documented. Subject data will be included in the analysis up to the date of the consent 
withdrawal. The distinction must be made between subjects who withdraw consent verses those who decline study therapy.   
Procedure for Discontinuation:  
 The procedure to be followed at the time a subject withdraws consent from the trial: 
- Check for the development of SAEs or study-related adverse events. 
- Complete the End-of-Study form; include an explanation of why the subject is 
withdrawing consent. 
Subject Lost to Follow-Up:   
 In the event that all possible attempts to locate the subject have failed, all efforts made by

  8. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS, DATA ANALYSIS AND DATA MONITORING   
 In the study, populations used for testing comparable efficacy, the non-inferiority margin 
proposed for determining comparable efficacy, the statistical procedures used for summarizing 
and testing the primary and secondary comparable efficacy endpoints, and sample size 
justification for the proposed study. All analyses are two-tailed and use alpha=0.05.  8.1 Analysis of populations :  
 Primary efficacy analyses will be conducted on the Intent-To-Treat (ITT) Population, defined 
as all subjects who are randomized. Sensitivity analyses for efficacy will also be conducted on 
the Per-Protocol Population, defined as all subjects who complete assigned activities for at least 
[ADDRESS_92285] to follow-up, multiple imputation using all available evaluation data will be utilized. No interim analysis is planned.  8.2 Summarization of safety data :  
 This is a low-risk interventional study, and the FDA has determined it to be a non-significant 
risk device study.  As a result, no data and safe ty monitoring board is planned. Adverse events 
will be regularly assessed, and those considered likely attributable to study procedures will be documented, as will all SAEs. Within each tr eatment arm, the frequency and percentage of 
study-related adverse events and SAEs will be t abulated and reported by [CONTACT_479], system organ-
class, and preferred term.  Any study-related adverse events will be summarized as those 
leading to a specific intervention, those leading to study discontinuation, and by [CONTACT_926]. Any SAEs will be reported similarly.  
 8.3 Key covariates: 
 Key covariates to include in the data analysis model are based on established predictors in 
this setting116, 117:  time post-stroke (number of days from stroke onset to randomization), 
severity of impairment (arm motor FM score at Baseline Visit), age, and enrollment site. Stroke 
subtype (ischemic vs. intracerebral hemorrhage) will also be included as a covariate. 	
Primary outcome measure :  
 The primary outcome measure is the within-subject change in arm motor FM score 	from 
Baseline Visit to 30 Day Follow Up Visit ( ∆FM). The higher the FM score, the better the outcome.  
Hence, with therapy, we anticipate the primar y outcome measure will be an increase in FM 
score for each subject. Non-inferiority margin :  
 The trial seeks to establish comparable efficacy based upon a non-inferiority margin of 2.05 (a value that is less than half the minimal clinically important difference for change in FM score)  
for the difference between the two treatment groups in the mean within-subject change in FM 
score from Baseline Visit to the 30 day Follow Up Visit.  We consider a maximum of 30% 
smaller mean ∆
FM in the telerehabilitation group (as compared to the in-clinic treatment) to be 
clinically acceptable to consider it to be non-inferior. Based upon preliminary data, the mean ∆FM 
for the telerehabilitation group is expected to be 4.80 points. Thus, if the assumed mean ∆FM is 
6.85 points in the in-clinic group, a reduction up to 30% (2.05 points) to 4.80 points in the 
telerehabilitation group would be concluded to be comparably efficacious. 
Primary efficacy analysis :  
 The primary analysis of the ∆FM will be conducted using an analysis of covariance 
(ANCOVA) model, adjusting for days from stroke onset to randomization, FM score at Baseline 
Visit, age, and enrollment site. The lower bound of the 95% confidence interval for the difference in ∆
FM between treatment groups will be used to assess comparable efficacy. If the 
lower bound of the 95% confidence interval for the difference in ∆FM between groups (i.e., ∆FM 
TeleRehab  CONFIDENTIAL   April 21, 2016 
 
 
 18  
  
  for the telerehabilitation group - ∆FM for the in-clinic group) is greater than -2.05, then we would 
declare telerehabilitation to be non-inferior. Determination of sample size :   
 The objective of this study is to assess comparable efficacy of telerehabilitation vs. in-clinic 
intensive arm motor rehabilitation therapy with respect to the mean ∆
FM from the Baseline Visit 
to the 30 Day Follow Up Visit, using a non-inferiority margin of 2.05. Based on our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], the mean ∆
FM in the telerehabilitation group is expected to be 4.80 with SD=3.80; extension to 
multiple sites and enrollment of subjects at earlier time points post-stroke may be associated with larger variance, and so a SD=4.0 is assumed. Comparable efficacy will be established 
provided that the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval for the difference in the ∆
FM 
between treatment groups is greater than -2.05. Assuming 80% power, the study will therefore seek to attain 30 Day Follow Up data on N=124 subjects (62 per arm). If the dropout rate is as high as 20%, then as many as 155 subjects may need to be enrolled. 
 8.4 Secondary efficacy analyses: 	
 Two secondary endpoints examining change in motor status will be examined.  Each examines treatment effects along an independen t dimension, and will be analyzed as above.  
These are  
- Within-subject change in Box & Blocks score from the Screening Visit to the [ADDRESS_92286] Scale-Hand Domain score from the Baseline 
Visit to the 30 Day Follow Up Visit 
8.5 Secondary outcome measures: 
Stroke education   
- Gains in stroke knowledge from Screening Visit to Post-Therapy Visit, measured as 
the change in percentage of questions answered correctly on the Stroke Education 
Exam 
 In order to determine whether targeted educational material significantly increases subject knowledge related to stroke, the Stroke Knowledge Exam will be administered twice, once at the Screening Visit then again at the Post-Therapy Visit.  A repeated measures ANOVA will be performed to determine if the percentage of Stroke Knowledge Exam answered correctly 
increases significantly from the Screening Visit to the Post Therapy Visit, controlling for days 
from stroke onset to randomization, initial Stroke Knowledge Exam score (at the Screening Visit), age, and enrollment site. To determine if gains in stroke knowledge vary according to the method by [CONTACT_84648], analysis will be repeated adding a time X group interaction term. Weight and blood pressure will be measured during the Screening Visit as well as during the Post Therapy Visit.  In order to determine whether gains in stroke knowledge are 
associated with improvements in stroke risk factor control, the relationship between gains in 
stroke knowledge (the change in percentage of questions answered correctly on the Stroke Education Exam from the Screening Visit to t he Post Therapy Visit) and improvement in weight 
and blood pressure control (change in weight, change in systolic blood pressure, and change in diastolic blood pressure) will be examined, controlling for days from stroke onset to 
randomization, Stroke Knowledge Exam score at Screening Visit, age, and enrollment site, and 
using a Bonferroni-adjusted alpha = 0.017; again, analyses will be repeated by [CONTACT_1583] a time X group interaction term. 	
Compliance and motivation .
		
- Compliance with therapy, defined as the percentage of the [ADDRESS_92287] 40 min of assigned 
therapy has been completed based on self-report for the in-clinic group and by [CONTACT_84649]. To determine whether compliance with therapy differs according to treatment  group, ANCOVA modeling will be used to examine 
compliance across the 36 sessions as a function of treatment group, controlling for days from stroke onset to randomization, age, and enro llment site.  Secondary analysis will examine 
compliance with only the supervised therapy sessions, as well as compliance with only the 
unsupervised sessions.  
Motivation (assessed along two independent dimensions): 
- Activity-inherent motivation, defined as the change in score on the Physical Activity 
Enjoyment (PACES) Scale from baseline to end of the first week of therapy 
- Consequence-related motivation, defined as the score on the Optimization in Primary 
and Secondary Control (OPS) Scale at the Baseline Visit 
Activity-inherent motivation reflects how much a s ubject likes or dislikes an activity itself, 
independent of his or her commitment to the treatment goals. To measure this, the PACES Scale will be scored three times (at the Baseline Visit, after 3 supervised sessions, and after 18 supervised sessions).  Activity-inherent motivation will be defined as the change in PACES 
score.  Primary analysis will examine the change from baseline to end of week 1, while 
secondary analysis will examine change from baseline to end of week 6. To determine whether activity-inherent motivation is different for in-clinic vs. telerehabilitation therapy, ANCOVA modeling will examine differential change in PACES score between the two treatment groups, controlling for days from stroke onset to randomization, PACES score at the Baseline Visit, age, and enrollment site.
	
 Consequence-related motivation reflects a subject’s level of commitment to treatment goals. To measure this, the OPS Scale will be scored three times (at the Baseline Visit, after 3 supervised sessions, and after 18 supervised sessions). We hypothesize that across both treatment groups, the baseline level of consequence-related motivation (OPS score at the Baseline Visit) will predict compliance with rehabilitation therapy. Furthermore, we hypothesize 
that when consequence-related motivation is high compliance will be high for both treatment 
groups, however when consequence-related motivation is low compliance may be lower overall but will vary with the level of activity-inher ent motivation. ANCOVA modeling will be used to 
determine if consequence-related motivation is a significant predictor of compliance with therapy (as defined above, across all 36 sessions), controlling for days from stroke onset to randomization, age, and enrollment site. Prim ary analysis will define consequence-related 
motivation using the OPS subscale that meas ures selective primary and selective secondary 
control striving (also referred to as goal engagement). Secondary analyses will define consequence-related motivation using the entire OPS score, and will also examine the effect of treatment group. An additional analysis will examine add the interaction term OPS x PACES to determine whether compliance varies with consequence-related motivation in a manner that 
depends on level of activity-inherent motivation; PACES and OPS scores will be centered and 
then combined in the interaction term.

12. ESTIMATED PERIOD OF TIME TO COMPLETE THE STUDY   
 The target enrollment rate is at least 2 patients enrolled per month per site.  Enrollment of 
124 subjects with complete data is planned; assuming a dropout rate as high as 20%, as many as [ADDRESS_92291] (from Screening Visit to 30 Day Follow Up Visit), the study is  expected to run approximately [ADDRESS_92292] patient. Data cleaning (including final monitoring visits) and statistical analysis is expected to take up to an additional 6 months.    13. HUMAN SUBJECTS   
 
13.1 Sample Size:   
 A total of 124 subjects completing all treatment and testing is desired; assuming a dropout 
rate as high as 20%, as many as 155 subjects may need to be enrolled. Patient characteristics, 
including number, age range, and health status, will in all cases conform to the below 
Inclusion/exclusion criteria. There are no special classes of subjects.

weeks of therapy, within 25 miles of the central study site and with Verizon wireless reception. ** 
**A site may enroll a person who does not meet exclusion criterion # 17 if this is 
specifically approved by [CONTACT_779]’s study PI. 
**Because Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores may be difficult to interpret for 
patients with aphasia, at the discretion of the site's study PI, exclusion criterion #5 (“MoCA score cannot be <22”) can be waived. 
13.3 Intended gender, the age range, intended racial and ethnic distribution, and if vulnerable subjects:   
 The recruitment process will not involve any  restrictions on socio-demographic factors 
including gender or ethnic characteristics of the patient population. Children age 18-21 will be permitted study enrollment; younger children will not be offered enrollment because stroke and stroke recovery are very different in younger brains and require separate study.  The 
composition of the study population will depend on patient sources available to the enrolling 
sites. 
All subjects must be able to sign their own consent and speak sufficient English to comply 
with study procedures.  
 13.4 Identifying the source  of the study population:    
 Some potential enrollees will be identified when they contact [CONTACT_84655].  Ot hers will be identified during the acute stroke 
admission at the clinical site or its referral hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], or during the stroke rehabilitation admission at the clinical site or its referral hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]; as described in Section 10 (above), the medical record 
of patients considered potentially eligible for the study may be reviewed by [CONTACT_84656] a patient is potentially eligible for this study or not. Most 
patients contact[CONTACT_84657] a stage post-stroke to be eligible for the study, and so these

  13.5. Plans for recruitment of subjects:   
 A study flyer will be generated and individualized for each site. The methods used for 
recruitment of subjects in the study will be devoid of any procedures that may be construed as coercive.   Beginning 3-[ADDRESS_92298] of potential enrollees.  
Those who are not ready but remain potentially interested will be informed that they will be contact[CONTACT_84658] a month’s time, unless it is [ADDRESS_92299]-stroke, in which case the patient will be informed that they will no longer be contact[CONTACT_84659].   A phone screen for those who are interested in enrolling takes < 5 minutes and asks 
(1) date of their stroke onset, and if they (2) live <25 miles from the clinical site, (3) are ≥ 18 
years old, (4) speak sufficient English to participate, (5) can commit to 18 in-clinic sessions (given the 50% chance of being randomized to this group), and (6) can likely score at least 3 on the Box & Block Test (can grasp an inch-wide object with the paretic hand, lift it off the table [ADDRESS_92300] three times in one minute). If 
these 5 questions are all answered in the affirmative, he/she will be invited to the clinical site for 
the Screening Visit.  
Informed consent Process: 
 Consent will be obtained by [CONTACT_84660].  The consent must be the IRB-approved version corresponding to the version of the protocol approved when the subject was consented. Signed informed consent must be 
obtained from the patient before any procedure, done solely for the purposes of research, is 
conducted. Consent by a legally authorized representative and verbal consent are not allowed for this study. As in all trials, the goal is to achieve a high level of compliance with protocol requirements by [CONTACT_84661]. In addition, patients with a strong likelihood of non-adherence, as described in the 
eligibility criteria, should not knowingly be randomized. Careful assessment of the patient’s 
understanding of the trial is required prior to enrollment.  
Screen failure Logs: 
Screen failure logs at each site will be entered into the study database listing all patients 
who sign consent and are then screened, but are not randomized into the Telerehabilitation Trial. Documentation will include demographic information and reasons for non-enrollment. No 
other data will be entered into WebDCU
TM for screen failures.  Screening data will be 
periodically reviewed by [CONTACT_84662], and to identify any patterns with regard to ineligibility or reasons for non-enrollment. 
14. RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT 
 14.1.  What is the level of risk?   
 The FDA has determined that this investigation is a non-significant risk device study.  
14.2. How does the anticipated benefit justify the risk, and Is the anticipated 
benefit of this research at least as favorable to the subjects as available alternative approaches?   
TeleRehab  CONFIDENTIAL   April 21, [ADDRESS_92301] benefit of participating in the study is to society via an improved understanding of the factors related to home-based telerehabilitation. 
Because of the research methods and screening approaches to be adopted, as described 
above, the risks to subjects are considered very small. The potential value of the information to be learned might be high. Therefore, the risk-benefit analysis for participation in the proposed studies is considered to be reasonable.  
 14.3. Does this research represent an increase over minimal risk?  
 No. 
 14.4. How does this research present experiences to subjects that are reasonably 
commensurate with those inherent in their actual or expected everyday life situations ?  
 Post-acute stroke the use of intensive rehabilitation therapy is considered standard of care and is routinely prescribed either as inpatient or outpatient treatment. It is anticipated that the 
population enrolled in this trial will be exper iencing or will have experienced some form of 
rehabilitative therapy that would provide a fram e of reference for the subjects. The introduction 
of telerehabilitation technology may be novel to a subject but explanations will be provided during the consenting process.   
 14.5. How this research may yield generalizable knowledge?   
 Stroke is among the leading causes of adult disability. A number of factors highlight the 
potential for telehealth methods to improve patient outcomes, in an economical way. Bringing these issues to broad usage requires further study on many fronts. Some of these issues are addressed in this study.   14.6. Describe any potential RISKS OR DISCOMFORTS in detail .   
Overall the risks related to this study are small. One potential risk related to study 
participation is breach of security for data handling, which could potentially result in a loss of 
privacy of sensitive medical/neurological info rmation. A number of steps to safe guard 
Information will be taken including the use of locks for files and use of passwords for computer files to maintain this risk as extremely small. A ll computer signals from the subject’s home to the 
lab will use methods that maximize security. The computer provided for home use will contain 
no personal information. Any data related to a subject's arm motor function is labeled with the 
subject ID number and has no identifying information.   A second potential source of potential risk is the telerehabilitation system. The risk of hardware is expected to be extremely small. The ri sk of daily participation for [ADDRESS_92302] will be given $50, to help with 
transportation and parking.  If the subject leaves  the study early for any reason, they will be 
provided with appropriate compensation to help with transportation and parking costs while in 
the study.

INTRODUCTION:  
 A biomedical or health-related research study is performed to answer specific questions about a 
disease.    
 Before you agree to participate in this research study, it is important that you be told the 
purpose, procedures, benefits, risks, discomforts, and precautions of the research. You should 
also be told what alternative procedures are av ailable to you if you do not participate in the 
research study.  The informed consent document is a written summary of this information. Be 
sure to ask questions while you read this consent document and ask questions if there is anything that you do not understand.   
TeleRehab  CONFIDENTIAL   April 21, [ADDRESS_92333] the study at any  time. Leaving the study will not result in any 
penalty or loss of benefits to you.  
 The researcher and sponsor of this study do not pr omise that you will receive any benefits from 
this study. 
 
WHY IS THIS RESEARCH BEING DONE?  
 
Occupational and physical rehabilitation therapy (OT and PT) may help a person recover after 
stroke.  The amount of therapy a person receives ma y affect recovery.   Larger doses of therapy 
may work better. Some patients may receive too small a dose of therapy.  This may be related 
to high cost, limited access, and difficulty with travel.   
 Telehealth methods may help address this problem.  Telehealth allows people in their homes to 
use the internet to obtain healthcare from medical professionals.   
 Telerehabilitation is a type of telehealth.  It allows a patient to use the internet to obtain 
rehabilitation therapy at home.  
 The main purpose of this study is to find out if telerehabilitation is as good as therapy provided 
in person to help people recover from a stroke.   Another purpose of the study is to find out if 
providing educational materials improves understanding of stroke prevention and risk factor control.  
 
WHY HAVE YOU BEEN ASKED TO TAKE PART IN THIS RESEARCH STUDY?  
 
TeleRehab  CONFIDENTIAL   April 21, [ADDRESS_92334] been diagnosed with stroke that caused arm weakness.  
 
HOW LONG WILL YOU BE IN THE RESEARCH STUDY?  
 You will be in the research study for approximately 10-[ADDRESS_92335] your safety and welfare.  
 
If you withdraw or are removed from the study, t he reasons for study exit will be discussed with 
you and all questions will be answered.  You will  not be required to undergo any procedures to 
exit the study.

SITE NAME}. 
 
HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL TAKE PART IN THE RESEARCH STUDY?  
 A total of 8-12 different sites in the [LOCATION_002] will enroll a total of 124 patients into this study.    
WHAT IS INVOLVED IN THE RESEARCH STUDY?  
 
You will be randomized to either the “in-clinic therapy” or “telerehabilitation therapy” group. 
Randomization means that you are put into a gro up completely by [CONTACT_3364]. It is like flippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a 
coin.   
 
You and the treatment therapi[INVESTIGATOR_84622] y our therapy will know the group you are in. The 
study assessment therapi[INVESTIGATOR_84623]. Please do not share this information with the assessment therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]. 
 If you are randomized into the “in-clinic therapy” group you will, 
 Go to the clinic 4 times for testing 
 Go to the clinic 18 times for rehabilitation therapy  
 Perform 18 days of rehabilitation in your home using an instructional booklet.  
 
If you are randomized into the “telerehabilitation therapy” group, you will, 
 Go to the clinic 4 times for testing 
TeleRehab  CONFIDENTIAL   April 21, 2016

   Perform [ADDRESS_92336] intensive arm therapy 6 days per w eek for 6 weeks in a row in this study.   
You may receive rehabilitation therapy that is not part of this study as long as it does not 
interfere with you completing study testing and therapy.  This non-study therapy may include 
occupational, physical, or speech therapy.   You may not receive Botox treatments to your arm, 
leg, to trunk until after Visit 4 is completed.  Botox (or botulinum toxin) is sometimes used to help 
a stiff muscle relax after a stroke. We will re cord the amount and type of non-study therapy you 
receive at each of the assessment visits. 
 
Visit 1 All Participants:  
This visit will occur 3 weeks to 35 weeks after your stroke.   We will ask you to sign the current 
“informed consent” form, then determine whether you are eligible to be in this study. We will ask 
you questions about your medical history.   You will also perform activities to test your strength, 
arm function, mood, and which hand you prefer to use. If you are eligible for this study, you will 
return for Visit 2.

 Unsupervised home-based therapy:  You will per form 3 unsupervised sessions per week 
(Tuesday/Thursday/Saturday when possible) for [ADDRESS_92340].  After 
you complete the 6 weeks of therapy, we will make an appointment to come back to your house 
to remove the telerehabilitation system. 
 You should not use the home telerehabilitation system for more than 80 minutes a day. The 
system is programmed to limit daily use to 80 minutes.  Nobody besides you should use your 
telerehabilitation system.  At the start of each therapy session, the system will take some 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_84625]. The computer and 
telerehabilitation system will not operate for anything other than the planned telerehabilitation. 
 You will be introduced to your telerehabilitation system at the end of Visit 2.

Terms Definition of terms 
Baseline  Observed values/findings that are regarded observed starting point for 
comparison.   
Enroll To register or enter into a clinical trial.  NOTE: Once a subject has been 
enrolled, the clinical trial protocol applies to the subject.   
Intervention  The drug, therapy or process under investigation  in a clinical study that is 
believed to have an effect on outcomes of interest in a study.  (e.g., 
health-related quality of life, efficacy, safety  and pharmacoeconomics).   
Investigational 
period Period of time where major interests of protocol objectiv es are observed, and 
where the test drug or comparative drug (sometimes without randomization) is 
usually given to a subject, and continues until the last assessment after 
completing administration of the test drug or comparative drug.  
Postinvestigational 
period Period of time after the last assessment  of the protocol.  Follow -up 
observations for sustained adverse events and/or survival are done in this 
period. 
Randomization  The process of assigning trial subjects to treatment or control groups using an 
element of chance to determine assignments in order to reduce bias.  
Screen failure  Potential subject who did not meet [ADDRESS_1205869] site completing the 
study.

Exploratory Objective  (North America sites only)  
• To determine gene mutations potentially related to resistance of enzalutamide plus ADT as 
assessed by [CONTACT_864720](s):  
Approximately 250 centers globally  
Study Population:  
The study population will consist of subjects with mHSPC.   
Number of Subjects to be  Randomized:  
Approximately 1100 subjects  
Study Design Overview:  
This is a multinational phase 3, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled efficacy and safety 
study of enzalutamide plus ADT versus placebo plus ADT in subjects with mHSPC.  
Approximately 1100 subjects will be randomized centrally 1:1, and the randomization will be 
stratified by [CONTACT_864721] (low versus high) and prior docetaxel therapy for prostate cancer (no 
prior docetaxel, 1 -5 cycles, 6 cycles).  High volume of diseas e is defined as metastases involving the 
viscera or, in the absence of visceral lesions, there must be [ADDRESS_1205872] is tolerating the study drug and 
continues ADT until radiographic disease progression is documented as outlined in the table below or 
starting an investigational agent  or new therapy for treatment of prostate cancer. It is recommended 
that subjects remain on study treatment until radiographic progression is confirmed by [CONTACT_864722].  Subjects who discontinue study treatment without radiographic progression 
will continue to follow the radiographic assessment schedule until radiographic progression event is 
confirmed by [CONTACT_864723] . All subjects will be followe d until death to assess 
for OS. Once the final number of events has been reached to trigger the final OS analysis , survival 
follow-up will be considered complete and subjects will be discontinued from long term follow -up. 
Study films (computed tomography [CT]/magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] and bone scan) should 
be read on site and also be submitted in digital format to the Sponsor-designated facility for 
independent central review.  Each site should ideally designate the same reader who will evaluate the 
images for any  one subject for the duration of the trial.  
Radiographic disease progression is defined by [CONTACT_16622] 
(RECIST) version 1.1 for soft tis sue disease or the appearance of 2 or more new lesions on bone scan.  
The documentation and confirmation required for the determination of radiographic progression is 
listed in the following table.

The following assessments of prostate cancer status will be collected during the course of the study: 
PSA, soft tissue disease on CT scan or on MRI, bone disease on radionuclide bone scans, survival 
status, EQ-5D-5L, QLQ-PR25, FACT -P for QoL and BPI -SF for pain  symptom assessment.  Once the 
final number of events has been reached to trigger the final OS analysis , sites will no longer be 
required to collect EQ -5D-5L, QLQ-PR25, FACT -P for QoL and BPI -SF. 
Throughout the study, safety and tolerability will be assesse d by [CONTACT_367253], vital 
signs, physical examinations, 12 -lead electrocardiograms (ECGs), and safety laboratory evaluations.  
An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will monitor the safety data on an ongoing 
basis. 
Subjects wi ll have a safety follow -up visit [ADDRESS_1205877] not met any discontinuation criteria may 
continue their open -label treatment in another Astellas -sponsored study.  
The sponsor will monitor study enrollment for proportion of subjects enrolled with a history of prior 
docetaxel treatment, and may either change the samp le size, or cap the number of subjects who 
received prior docetaxel to ensure that the primary endpoint is not driven either by [CONTACT_864725], or by [CONTACT_864726].  
The data gathered from the ARCHES study may be used to support future research studies.

Concomitant Medication Restrictions or Requirements:  
Required Concomitant Treatment  
All subjects will be required to maintain ADT during study  treatment , either using a n LHRH 
agonist/antagonist or having a history of bilateral orchiectomy.  
Prohibited Concomitant Treatments  
The following medications are prohibited within 4 weeks of day 1 and during the study treatment 
period: 
• 5 α-reductase inhibitors (finasteride, dutasteride);  
• Estrogens;  
• Cyproterone acetate;  
• Biologic or other agents with  potential antitumor activity against prostate cancer  (with the 
exception of those therapi[INVESTIGATOR_864684]. 1) ; 
• Systemic glucocorticoids greater than the equi valent of 10  mg per day of prednisone  intended for 
the treatment of prostate cancer ; 
• Herbal medications that have known hormonal antiprostate cancer activity and/or are known to 
decrease PSA levels (i.e., saw palmetto);  
• Androgens (testosterone, dihydroepia ndrosterone, etc.);  
• Investigational agents.  
In addition, bisphosphonates and denosumab are prohibited unless stabilized for [ADDRESS_1205899] exposure to enzalutamide:  
• Strong cytochrome P450 ( CYP) 2C8 inhibitors (e.g., gemfibrozil) are to be avoided .  If subject 
must be coadministered a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor, the dose of enzalutamide should be reduced to 
80 mg once daily .  If coadministration of the stro ng inhibitor is discontinued, the enzalutamide 
dose should be returned to the d ose used prior to initiation of the strong CYP2C8 inhibitor.  
• Strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. , carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampin) or moderate 
CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. , bosentan, efavirenz, etravirine, modafinil, nafcilin, St. John ’s Wort) 
should be avoided if possible as they may reduce enzalutamide plasma concentration if 
coadministered.  Selection of a concomitant medication with no or minimal CYP3A4 induction 
potential is recommended.  
• Enzalutamide is a strong inducer of CYP3A4 and a moderate ind ucer of CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 .  
Medicinal products with a narrow therapeutic range that are substrates of CYP3A4 (e.g. , alfentanil, 
cyclosporine, dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, fentanyl, pi[INVESTIGATOR_3924], q uinidine, sirolimus, 
tacrolimus), CYP2C9 (e.g., phenytoin, wa rfarin), or CYP2C19, or UGT1A1 (e.g.,  S-mephenytoin) 
should be avoided if possible, as enzalutamide may decrease their exposure.  
• If enzalutamide coadministration with warfarin cannot be avoided, additional international 
normalized ratio ( INR) monitoring should be conducted.  
• Enzalutamide is an inhibitor of human P-glycoprotein ( P-gp) and may increase exposure to 
medicines that are P -gp substrates .  Medicinal products with a narrow therapeutic range that are 
substrates for P -gp (e.g., digoxin, c olchicine, dabigatran etexilate) s hould be used with caution 
when administered concomitantly with enzalutamide .

Statistical Methods:  
Sample Size Justification:  
Approximately 1100 subjects (550 subjects per treatment arm) will be randomized in the study .   
The final analysis of rPFS will be conducted with a minimum of 262 progression events based on the 
following considerations:  
A target hazard rati o (HR) is 0.67.  The expected median rPFS for the ADT arm is 20 months as 
measured from the date of randomization.  A target HR of 0.67 corresponds to a pproximately  50% 
increase in median rPFS for the enzalutamide plus ADT arm relative to the placebo plus ADT arm 
(approximately 30 versus 20 months). 
The required minimum of 262 rPFS events (radiographic progression or death on study, defined as 
death from any cause within [ADDRESS_1205902]) provides 
90% power t o detect a target HR of 0.[ADDRESS_1205903] and significance level of 
0.05.  
Sponsor: APGD  ISN/Protocol [ADDRESS_1205904] Populations:  
Intent-to-Treat Population:  
The Intent -to-Treat (ITT) population is defined as all subjects who were randomized in this study.   
The ITT population will be analyzed by [CONTACT_150045] (i.e., treatment arm based on 
randomization assignment). The ITT population will be used to conduct efficacy analyses.  For the 
ORR, only subjects with measurable disease at baseline will be includ ed in the analysis.  
Safety Population:  
The safety population is defined as all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug. 
The safety population will be analyzed by [CONTACT_221432] (i.e., based on the treatment the 
subject actu ally received rather than the treatment to which the subject was randomized). The safety 
population will be used to conduct safety analyses.  
Efficacy:  
Primary Endpoint  
• rPFS: Defined as the time from randomization to the first objective evidence of radiographic 
disease progression as assessed by [CONTACT_864732] (defined as death from any cause within 
24 weeks from study drug discontinuation), whichever occurs first.  
Secondary Endpoints  
• OS: Defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause.  
• Time to first SSE:  Defined as the time from randomization to the occurrence of the first SSE.  SSE 
is defined as radiation or surgery to bone, clinically apparent patholog ical bone fracture or spi[INVESTIGATOR_90973].  
• Time to castration resistance:  Defined as the time from randomization to the first 
castration -resistant event (radiographic disease progression, PSA progression or SSE), whichever 
occurs first.  
• Time to deterioration of QoL:  Defined as time from randomization to a [ADDRESS_1205905]-P total score.  
• Time to deterioration in urinary symptoms: Defined as time from randomization to  an increase of 
≥ 50% of the standard deviation at baseline in the modified urinary symptoms score of QoL PR25 . 
• Time to initiation of a new antineoplastic therapy:  Defined as the time from randomization to the 
initiation of antineoplastic subsequent to the study treatments.  
• Time to PSA progression:  Defined as the time fro m randomization to PSA progression, which is a 
≥ 25% increase and an absolute increase of ≥ 2 µg/L (2 ng/mL) above the nadir (i.e., lowest PSA 
value observed post baseline or at baseline), which is confirmed by a second consecutive value at 
least 3 weeks l ater.  
• PSA undetectable rate:  Defined as percentage of subjects with detectable (≥ 0.2  ng/mL) PSA at 
baseline which become undetectable (< 0.2 ng/mL) during study treatment.  
• ORR: Defined as the percentage of subjects with measureable disease at baseline wh o achieved a 
complete or partial response in their soft tissue disease using the RECIST version 1.1 criteria.  
• Time to pain progression:  Defined as time from randomization to an increase of ≥ 30% in pain 
severity score from baseline using the BPI -SF. 
All secondary endpoint analyses will be performed at the time of the rPFS primary analysis.  
Six secondary endpoints (OS, time to PSA progression, time to initiation of a new antineoplastic 
therapy, the rate of PSA decline to < 0.2 ng/mL, ORR and t ime to deteri oration in urinary symptoms )

Version 5.1 Incorporating Nonsubstantial Amendment 6 1 INTRODUCTION  
Worldwide, prostate cancer ranks second in cancer incidence and sixth in cancer mortality in 
males [Jemal et al, 2011].  P rostate cancer progresses through a series of characteristic clinical 
states that represent both the natural history of the disease and response to treatment, as 
indicated in the figure below [Scher & Heller, 2000] [ Figure 1].  
Figure 1 Clinical States Model of Prostate Cancer Progression  
 
CRPC: castration -resistant prostate cancer; PSA: prostate -specific antigen; M0: nonmetastatic  
Source: modified from [Scher & Heller, 2000]  
Early in the disease, prostate cancers need relatively high levels of androgens to grow.  Such 
prostate cancers are referred to as androgen dependent or hormone sensitive; therefore, 
treatments that decrease and rogen levels or block androgen activity can inhibit their growth.  
Combined androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with a luteinizing  hormone-releasing hormone 
analogue (LHRHA) or surgical castration, plus a conventional nonsteroidal antiandrogen 
(NSAA) such as  bicalutamide, nilutamide or flutamide, is widely used as initial treatment for 
hormone sensitive prostate cancer.  Meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials showed a 3% 
absolute improvement in 5 -year survival rates with the addition of a conventional NSAA to an 
LHRHA or surgical castration [Lancet, 2000].  Residual, low -level androgen receptor (AR) 
signaling, or agonist activity from conventional NSAA, may provide a stimulatory signal to 
hormone sensitive prostate cancer cells.  
1.1 Background  
ADT has been the preferred initial treatment for locally advanced and metastatic prostate 
cancer [Singer et al, 2008].  Presently available androgen deprivation therapi[INVESTIGATOR_864691]-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists, LHRH antagonists and 
antiandrogens.   Treatment with LHRH analogues results in prostate -specific antigen (PSA) 
decline (the secreted protein product of the AR regulated gene), tumor regression and 
improved survival, in concert with an increased morbidity and poor quality of life (QoL).  
LHRH analogue-induced side effects include, but are not limited to, hot flushes, sexual 
dysfunction, fatigue, reduced cognition, emotional instability/depression, bone loss, insulin 
resistance, hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], and cardiovascular disease [Keating et al, 201 2; Isbarn et al, 
2009; Taylor et al, 2009; Tombal & Berges , 2008].  

Sponsor: APGD  ISN/Protocol [ADDRESS_1205916] monotherapy 
that offers a similar efficacy profile to castration without the reduction in QoL [Makarov & 
Partin, 2008; Iversen et al, 1998; Kaisary et al, 1995].  It is possible that a more effective and 
profound AR blockade with a more potent AR blocker like enzalutamide might improve 
progression -free survival in patients with hormone sensitive prostate cancer.  
Also, in a large study (CHAARTED), the use of docetaxel with ADT versus ADT alone was 
evaluated in subjects with newly diagnosed m etastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer 
(mHSPC) [ Sweeney et al, 2015].  This study enrolled 790 subjects (397 subjects in the ADT 
plus docetaxel group and 393 subjects in the ADT alone group).  ADT plus docetaxel 
significantly improved median overall survival ( OS) (57.6 months) versus ADT alone 
(44.0 months) ( hazard ratio [ HR] = 0.61 [95% CI: 0.47, 0.80]; P  < 0.001).  Median time to 
clinical progression (symptoms or radiographic) was significantly longer in subjects treated 
with ADT plus docetaxel (3 3.0 months) versus subjects treated with ADT alone 
(19.8 months) (HR  = 0.61 [95% CI: 0. 50, 0.75]; P < 0.001). 
Consistent wit h the docetaxel data from CHAARTED, emerging data from another study 
(STAMPED E) also noted that the addition of docetaxel to standard hormonal therapy 
significantly improved survival among men with newly diagnosed , hormone -naïve, high -risk, 
locally advance d or metastatic prostate cancer [ James et al, 2015 ; Scher et al, 2015] .  In 
addition, a recent meta -analysis of 3  randomized controlled trials (GETUG -AFU, 
CHAARTED and STAMPEDE) that evaluated the combination of docetaxel and ADT in 
hormone sensitive metastatic prostate cancer, demonstrated that in subjects with metastatic 
prostate cancer the addition of docetaxel was associated with improved OS (HR = 0.74 
[95% CI: 0.61, 0.91]; P  = 0.003) and improvement in progression -free survival (metastatic 
patients: HR  = 0.63 [95% CI: 0.57, 0.70]; P  < 0.001) [Tucci et al, 2015].  
These studies concluded that the combination of standard ADT and [ADDRESS_1205917] ADT alone in men with hormone  
sensitive metasta tic prostate cancer.  The clinical benefit was more pronounced among 
subjects with a higher burden of disease.  Docetaxel treatment was associated with toxicities, 
but the risk –benefit ratio for its early use in combination with ADT is clearly favor able for 
use in subjects with high -volume metastatic prostate cancer.  
More effective therapi[INVESTIGATOR_864692] a proportion of 
mHSPC subjects treated with current therapi[INVESTIGATOR_864693] -resistant prostate 
cancer (CRPC) relatively quickly and suffer from disease -related morbidity and mortality.  
This study is designed to determine the benefit of enzalutamide plus ADT as compared to 
placebo plus ADT in subjects with mHSPC.

Version 5.1 Incorporating Nonsubstantial Amendment 6 Enzalutamide is a second generation AR inhibitor t hat competitively binds the AR with great 
potency.  Additionally, enzalutamide inhibits nuclear translocation of AR, inhibits the 
association of AR with DNA [ Tran et al, 2009], a nd has no known agonist activity when the 
AR is overexpressed.  
This protocol i s based on the hypothesis that earlier use of a therapy shown to be effective in 
the more advanced state of CRPC will delay progression, emergence of castration -resistant 
disease and prolong OS.  As such, this study aims to determine whether enzalutamide w ith its 
superior ability of androgen suppression will improve radiographic progression -free survival  
(rPFS) of men starting androgen suppression for newly diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer.   
1.[ADDRESS_1205919] in the setting of AR 
overexpression.  A major human metabolite of enzalutamide, N-desmethyl enzalutamide, 
demonstrated key primary pharmacodynamics with similar potency to the parent molecule.  
Enzalutamide and N-desmethyl enzalutamide bind to and antagonize the γ -aminobutyric acid 
(GABA)-gated chloride channel.  Enzalutamide given at high doses to mice induced 
dose-dependent convulsions, an observation that parallels the cli nical data showing that dose 
appears to be an important predictor of the risk of seizure in subjects.  As some molecules 
that antagonize the GABA -gated chloride channel are associated with convulsions, 
enzalutamide and N-desmethyl enzalutamide may both con tribute to the convulsions that 
were observed in nonclinical studies.  Safety pharmacology studies evaluating the central 
nervous, respi[INVESTIGATOR_864694] 160 mg/day.  
Following oral administration in animals, enzalutamide is eliminated slowly from plasma 
with a long t 1/2 across species.  In vitro studies showed that enzalutamide is metabolized by 
[CONTACT_279187] P450 (CYP) isoenzymes  CYP2C8 and CYP3A4/5.  
Enzalutamide and/or its major human metabolites caused direct in vitro inhibition of multiple 
CYP enzymes including CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4/5.  
In vitro, enzalutamide caused time -dependent inhibition of CYP 1A2.  Based on in vitro data, 
enzalutamide is an inducer of CYP3A4 but is not expected to induce CYP1A2 at 
therapeutically relevant concentrations.  
In vitro data show that enzalutamide and its active metabolite N-desmethyl enzalutamide are 
potential inhibi tors, but not substrates, of the efflux transporter P -glycoprotein (P -gp).

prominent effects occurring in reproductive and hormone sensitive tissues.  In studies in rat s 
(4 and 26 weeks) and dogs (4, 13 and 39 weeks), changes in the reproductive organs associated 
with enzalutamide were decreases in organ weight with atrophy of the prostate and epi[INVESTIGATOR_4046]. 
Additional changes related to reproductive and hormone  sensitive t issues included 
hypertrophy/hyperplasia of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_864695], seminiferous tubule degeneration and hypertrophy/hyperplasia of the 
Leydig cells in dogs.  Gender differences were noted in r at mammary glands (i.e., male atrophy 
and female lobular hyperplasia).  Changes in the reproductive organs in both species were 
consistent with the pharmacological activity of enzalutamide and reversed or partially resolved 
after an 8 -week recovery period.   There were no other important changes in clinical pathology 
or histopathology in any other organ system including the liver in either species.  
Hepatocellular toxicity is commonly associated with other antiandrogen compounds such as 
flutamide and nilutami de and both compounds are associated with liver injury in humans 
[Brahm et al, 2011; Gomez et al, 1992].  In contrast to other antiandrogens, enzalutamide 
showed no evidence of hepatotoxicity in animals or in the clinical program.  
Electrocardiogram (ECG) a nd cardiovascular assessments in a toxicity study in dogs showed 
no treatment -related effects.   In vivo and in vitro safety pharmacology studies also 
demonstrated the absence of cardiovascular enzalutamide -related effects.  
In a 6-month study in transgenic rasH2 mice, enzalutamide did not show carcinogenic 
potential (absence of neoplastic findings) at doses up to 20 mg/kg per day 
(AUC24h ≈317 μg∙h/mL), which resulted in plasma exposure levels similar to the clinical 
exposure (AUC 24h 322 μg∙h/mL) in metastati c CRPC patients receiving 160 mg, daily.  Daily 
oral dosing of rats with enzalutamide at 10 to 100 mg/kg for 2 years increased the incidence 
of neoplastic findings (compared to control) that were considered related to the primary 
pharmacology of enzalutami de.  These included benign thymoma, fibroadenoma in the 
mammary glands and benign Leydig cell tumors in the testes in males; benign granulosa cell 
tumor in the ovaries in females; and adenoma in the pars distalis of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_864696].  
In additio n, urothelial papi[INVESTIGATOR_864697] 100 mg/kg  per day dose and were considered secondary to the irritation caused by [CONTACT_864735]/calculi, which is known to occur in rodent species.  L eydig cell 
tumors in rats are generally not considered relevant to humans based on experience with 
other anti -androgens.  The human relevance of thymoma, pi[INVESTIGATOR_864698], but a potential relevance cannot be ruled out.  The exposure 
levels (based on AUC) achieved in this study for enzalutamide and its metabolites (M1 and 
M2) in rats were less than or similar to those in prostate cancer patients at the recommended 
dose of enzalutamide (Section 5.3, Company Core Data Sheet  version 6.0 ). 
Enzalutamide was nonmutagenic in bacteria, nonclastogenic in mammalian cells and 
nongenotoxic in vivo in mice.  The 2 major human metabolites ( N-desmethyl enzalutamide 
and an inactive carboxylic acid derivative) were negative for mutagenicit y in the bacterial 
reverse mutation assay (refer to the current Investigator’s Brochure).

Version 5.1 Incorporating Nonsubstantial Amendment 6 Enzalutamide could cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman based on its 
mechanism of action and embryo -fetal toxicity observed in mice.  Based on nonc linical 
findings in repeat -dose toxicology studies, which were consistent with the pharmacological 
activity of enzalutamide, male fertility may be impaired by [CONTACT_864736].  In 
studies in mice (4 weeks), rats (4 and 26 weeks) and dogs (4, 13  and 39 weeks), changes in 
the reproductive organs associated with enzalutamide were decreases in organ weight with 
atrophy of the prostate and epi[INVESTIGATOR_4046] (studies PRO3100NC39, PRO3100NC18 and 
PRO3100NC38 referenced in Company Core Data Sheet version 6.0 ).  In a pharmacokinetic 
study in pregnant rats with a single oral 30 mg/kg enzalutamide administration on gestation 
day 14, enzalutamide and/or its metabolites were present in the fetus at a C max that was 
approximately 0.3 times the concentration found in m aternal plasma and occurred 4 hours 
after administration (study 9785-ME-0046 referenced in Company Core Data Sheet version 
6.0).  Following a single oral administration in lactating rats on postnatal day 14, 
enzalutamide and/or its metabolites were present  in milk at a C max that was [ADDRESS_1205922] 1 dose of 
enzalutamide in completed and ongoing clinical studies (not including the expanded access 
program or 2 compassiona te use programs).  
The pharmacokinetics and metabolism of enzalutamide have been evaluated in more than 
[ADDRESS_1205923] ranged from 
30 to 600  mg. 
The pharma cokinetics of a single oral 160  mg dose of enzalutamide were examined in 
subjects with baseline mild, moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child -Pugh Class A, B, 
and C, respectively) and in matched control subjects with normal hepatic function 
(Study 9785-CL-0009 and Study 9785 -CL-0404).  Mild, moderate or severe hepatic 
impairment did not have a clinically relevant effect on the composite AUC of enzalutamide 
plus N-desmethyl enzalutamide.  Therefore, the results indicate that no starting dose 
adjustment is necessary for subjects with baseline mild, moderate or severe hepatic 
impairment.  
After oral administration to subjects with CRPC, the median time to reach maximum 
enzalutamide plasma concentrations was 1 hour, and the mean terminal half -life was 
5.8 days.  Enzalutamide steady state was achieved by [CONTACT_4475] 28, and the accumulation ratio was 
8.3-fold.  At steady state, enzalutamide showed approximately dose -proportional 
pharmacokinetics over the range of 30 to 360 mg/day.  Steady-state plasma levels of the 
active metabolite are similar to those of enzalutamide.  
Sponsor: APGD  ISN/Protocol [ADDRESS_1205924] on the AUC  of enzalutamide or 
N-desmethyl enzalutamide; therefore, enzalutamide can be taken with or without food.  
Based on population pharmacokinetics modeling, age, weight and renal function (creatinine 
clearance [CLCR ≥ 30 mL/minute] do not have clinically meanin gful effects on enzalutamide 
exposures; therefore, no dose adjustments are indicated for these covariates.  Based on 
pharmacokinetic data from a study in Japanese subjects with prostate cancer, there were no 
clinically relevant differences in exposure betw een Japanese and Caucasian subjects.  
Clinical data are insufficient to assess the potential effect of severe renal impairment 
(CLCR < 30 mL/minute) and end -stage renal disease on enzalutamide pharmacokinetics.  
A clinical drug -drug interaction study in pro state cancer subjects showed that enzalutamide 
can affect exposures to certain comedications.  At steady state, enzalutamide reduced the 
AUC of oral midazolam (CYP3A4 substrate), S -warfarin (CYP2C9 substrate) and 
omeprazole (CYP2C19 substrate) by 86%, 56% and 70%, respectively.  Therefore, 
enzalutamide is a strong CYP3A4 inducer and a moderate CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 inducer.  
Substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 with a narrow therapeutic index are to be 
avoided, as enzalutamide may decrease plasma exposure of these drugs.  If enzalutamide is 
coadministered with warfarin (CYP2C9 substrate), additional international normalized ratio 
(INR) monitoring needs to be conducted.  Enzalutamide (160 mg/day) did not have a 
clinically relevant effect on exposure to intra venous docetaxel (CYP3A4 substrate) or to oral 
caffeine (CYP1A2 substrate), dextromethorphan (CYP2D6 substrate) or pi[INVESTIGATOR_051] 
(CYP2C8 substrate).  
Another clinical drug -drug interaction study in healthy subjects showed that concomitant 
medications can aff ect exposure to enzalutamide.   Coadministration of gemfibrozil (a strong 
CYP2C8 inhibitor) increased the composite AUC of enzalutamide plus N-desmethyl 
enzalutamide by 2.2 -fold; therefore, strong CYP2C8 inhibitors are to be avoided.  If 
coadministration wi th a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor is necessary, the dose of enzalut amide 
needs to be reduced to 80  mg once daily.  Coadministration of itraconazole (strong CYP3A4 
inhibitor) increased the composite AUC of enzalutamide plus N-desmethyl enzalutamide by 
1.3-fold; as this small change is not clinically meaningful, no starting dose adjustment is 
needed when coadministering enzalutamide with CYP3A4 inhibitors.  Coadministration of 
rifampin (strong CYP3A4 and moderate CYP2C8 inducer) decreased the composite AUC of 
enzalutamide plus N-desmethyl enzalutamide by 37%, while C max remained unchanged 
(Study 9785 -CL-0405); as these changes are not considered clinically relevant, no starting 
dose adjustment is needed when coadministering enzalutamide with moderate CYP2C8 
inducers or CYP3A4 inducers.  
The potential for enzalutamide to affect the pharmacokinetics of other drugs via effects on 
drug transporters was assessed through a series of in vitro experiments.  Based on in vitro 
data, enzalutamide, N-desmethyl enzalutamide and/o r the carboxylic acid metabolite may be 
inhibitors of BCRP, MRP2 and OAT3 at clinically relevant systemic concentrations or in the 
Sponsor: APGD  ISN/Protocol [ADDRESS_1205925] enzalutamide, N-desmethyl enzalutamide and 
the carboxylic acid metabolite do not inhibit OATP1B1, OAT1B3, OCT1, OCT2, OAT1 and 
OAT3-mediated transport at clinically rele vant concentrations.  Enzalutamide is not a 
substrate for OATP1B1, OATP1B3 or OCT1, and N-desmethyl enzalutamide is not a 
substrate for P -gp or BCRP.  Based on in vitro data, enzalutamide is an inhibitor but not a 
substrate for P -gp; however, under conditi ons of clinical use, enzalutamide may be an inducer 
of P-gp via activation of pregnane X receptor.  Thus, enzalutamide may alter the plasma 
concentrations of coadministered medicinal products that are P -gp substrates (refer to current 
Investigator’s Brochu re). 
1.3 Summary of Key Safety Information for Study Drugs  
Enzalutamide has been approved by [CONTACT_1622], the EMA and Japan MHLW for metastatic  
CRPC.  Worldwide, enzalutamide has been approved for the treatment  of metastatic CRPC in  
more than 100 countries.  Enzalutamide has also been approved for nonmetastatic CRPC in 
the US, EU and Japan as well as in more than 60  countries.  In Dec 2019, enzalutamide was 
approved for the treatment of metastatic CSPC in the US (also referred to as  mHSPC) and a 
marketing appl ication for this indication is currently in review in the EU.   
The safety profile of enzalutamide in subjects with CRPC is derived primarily from 5 phase 3 
studies.  Study CRPC2 (AFFIRM) was a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, 
efficacy and saf ety clinical study of enzalutamide (160  mg daily) in 1199  subjects with 
progressive metastatic CRPC (mCRPC) previously treated with docetaxel -based 
chemotherapy.  Study MDV3100 -03 (PREVAIL) was a multinational, randomized, 
double-blind, placebo -controlled,  efficacy and safety clinical study of enzalutamide in 
[ADDRESS_1205926] failed ADT.  Study 
9785-CL-0232 (Asian PREVAIL) was similar to PREVAIL except in an Asian population of 
388 subjects.  Study MDV3100 -14 (PROSPER) wa s a randomized, double -blind, placebo -
controlled, efficacy and safety clinical study of enzalutamide (160  mg daily) in 1401 subjects 
with nonmetastatic CRPC at high risk of disease progression based on baseline 
prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level and sho rt PSA doubling time . 
An analysis of 5 pooled  phase 3 studies  (AFFIRM, PREVAIL , Asian PREVAIL , PROSPER  
and ARCHES ) indicated  that the most frequently reported treatment -emergent adverse events 
(TEAEs) reported in ≥ 10% of patients in the enzalutamide group (n  = 3371; enzalutamide  
dose; 160 mg/day) were:fatigue, back pain , nausea, hot flush , constipation, arthralgia, 
decreased appetite, diarrhea, hypertension, asthenia, fall, pain in extremity, mus culoskeletal 
pain and headache .  With the except ion of nausea and pain in extremity, each of these events 
occurred in the pooled phase  3 enzalutamide group with a ≥ 2% higher incidence than in the 
placebo group (n  = 2472).  Only 2 TEAEs showed a higher rate in the enzalutamide vs the 
placebo group (even t rate per 100 patient -years of treatment): fall (8.9%  enzalutamide vs 
4.6% placebo) and hypertension (8.2% vs 5.5%).

Version 5.1 Incorporating Nonsubstantial Amendment 6 When adjusted for treatment d uration, the event rates for grade ≥ 3 TEAEs showed small 
differences (≤ 1.2 events per 100 patient years ) between the enzalutam ide group and the 
placebo group.   
Study drug -related TEAEs reported in ≥  5% of patients in the enzalutamide group were 
fatigue (24.1% enzalutamide vs 14.1% placebo), hot flush (14.0% vs 8.7%), nausea (11.7% 
vs 10.4%),  decreased  appetite (8.2% vs 5.5%), asthenia (7.4% vs 4.4%), diarrhea (5.6% vs 
4.4%) and hypertension (5.6% vs 2.0% ). 
The incidence of TEAEs leading to death was low in the pooled enzalutamide groups (4.8%) 
and in the placebo group (2.8%)  and the adjusted event rates for serious TEAEs were also 
comparable in both groups .   
The incidence of TEAEs leading to permanent  discontinuation of study drug was similar in 
both groups; 17.2% in the pooled enzalutamide group s and 16.1% in the placebo gr oup.  The 
incidence of TEAEs leading to a dose reduction was 5.6%  in the phase 3 enzalutamide  group 
and 2.0% in the phase 3 placebo group. The incidence of TEAEs leading to a dosing 
interruption was 15.0%  in the phase 3 enzalutamide group and 9.9% in the p hase 3 placebo 
group 
The pooled phase 3 safety data confirms that convulsion/ seizure, cognitive and memory 
impairment, fatigue -related events, neutropenia/ neutrophil count decreased, fall, fracture  and 
hypertension are adverse events of special interest (A ESI) for enzalutamide.  Posterior 
reversible encephalopathy syndrome  (PRES) is also considered an AESI for  enzalutamide ; 
however, this is based on cases reported during postapproval use of enzalutamide  and not on 
events occurring  in clinical studies .

dermatitis bullous, dermatitis exfoliative generalized, drug reaction with eosinophilia and 
systemic symptoms, erythema multiforme, exfoliative rash, Stevens -Johnson syndrome, toxic

1.[ADDRESS_1205928] in the setting of androgen overexpression 
[Tran et al, 2009].  Enzalutamid e has a higher binding affinity to the AR (8  times greater), has 
no agonist activity and has demonstrated superior AR downstream effects in the setting of 
androgen overexpression compared to bicalutamide in preclinical studies.  
The efficacy of enzalutamide  in subjects with metastatic prostate cancer who progressed on 
ADT has been demonstrated in 5 randomized controlled phase 3 studies including study 
MDV3100 -03 (PREVAIL) in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic subjects and CRPC2 
(AFFIRM) in subjects with more  advanced disease who previously received docetaxel.  
Regardless of study arm, subjects remained on ADT in both PREVAIL and AFFIRM studies.  
These studies demonstrate  a statistically significant advantage of enzalutamide treatment over 
Sponsor: APGD  ISN/Protocol [ADDRESS_1205929] overall soft tissue 
response, and QoL as measured by [CONTACT_33743] -Prostate 
(FACT-P).  Study MDV3100 -03 (PREVAIL) showed a significant benefit of enzalutamide in 
time to initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy.    
Study MDV3100 -03 (PREVAIL; c hemotherapy naïve mCRPC subjects) was stopped after a 
planned interim analysis (conducted when 540 deaths had been reported) and showed a 
benefit of the active treatment.  The rate of rPFS at 12 months was 65% among subjects 
treated with enzalutamide, as compared with 14% among subjects receiving placebo (81% 
risk reduction; HR in the enzalutamide group, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.15 to 0.23; P  < 0.001). A total 
of 626 subjects (72%) in the enzalutamide group, as compared with 532  subjects (63%) in the 
placebo group, were alive at the data cutoff d ate (29% reduction in the risk of death; HR, 
0.71; 95% CI, 0.60  to 0.84; P  < 0.0001).  The benefit of enzalutamide was shown with 
respect to all secondary endpoints, including the time until the initiation of cytotoxic 
chemotherapy ( HR, 0.35), the time until the first skeletal -related event ( HR, 0.72), a complete 
or partial soft tissue response (59% versus 5%), the time until PSA progression ( HR, 0.17), 
and a rate of decline of at least 50% in PSA (78% versus 3%) (P  < 0.001 for all 
comparisons).  
Study CR PC2 (AFFIRM; p ostchemotherapy mCRPC subjects) demonstrated that 
enzalutamide treatment decreased the risk of death by 37% ( HR, 0.631; P  < 0.0001) 
compared with placebo treatment.  The median survival was 18.4 months in the enzalutamide 
arm and 13.6 months in the placebo arm ( difference  = 4.8 months).  The statistically 
significant and clinically meaningful benefit of enzalutamide treatment as measured by [CONTACT_864737][INVESTIGATOR_040] 42.0% of 
enzalutamide -treated and  61.4% of placebo -treated subjects receiving subsequent therapi[INVESTIGATOR_864700], including abiraterone (20.9% versus 24.3%) and cabazitaxel (9.8% 
versus 13.8%), both shown to improve OS following docetaxel treatment.  Enzalutamide 
treatment also  resulted in significant improvements over placebo treatment in all key 
secondary efficacy endpoints.  
In addition, in a phase 2, open -label, single -arm study (9785 -CL-0321) in patients with 
hormone-naïve prostate cancer, 92.5% (62 of 67) of patients had a ≥ 80% decline in PSA 
from baseline at week 25.  Of the 54 patients who were on treatment for 1 year (week 49), 
100% had a ≥ 80% decline in PSA from baseline.  Eleven (42.3%) of 26 evaluable patients 
with metastatic disease at study entry had a derived obje ctive response (confirmed complete 
response + confirmed partial response), 8 (30.8%) patients with confirmed complete 
response, and 3 (11.5%) patients with confirmed partial response.  
The primary e fficacy analysis in PROSPER demonstrated a statistically si gnificant, robust 
and substantial improvement in metastasis -free survival  together with clinically meaningful 
improvements in the key secondary endpoints of time to PSA progression and time to first 
use of new antineoplastic therapy and a trend in O S in favor of enzalutamide treatment .  The

Version 5.1 Incorporating Nonsubstantial Amendment 6 final OS analysis demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful 
improvement favoring enzalutamide and a 26.6% reduction in the risk of death .   
Lastly, the primary efficacy analysis in ARCHES demonst rated a statistically significant, 
robust and substantial improvement in radiographic progression -free survival  together with 
clinically meaningful improvements in the key secondary endpoints of time to PSA 
progression, time to start of a new antineoplasti c therapy, PSA undetectable rate and objective 
response rate  and a trend in OS  (observed at the time of interim analysis)  in favor of 
enzalutamide plus ADT versus placebo plus ADT treatment.  For the secondary endpoints, 
the ARCHES study demonstrated that enzalutamide  prolonged the time to the first 
symptomatic skeletal event  and time to castration -resistance.  Assessments of  patient-
reported outcomes  data showed that patients receiving enzalutamide plus ADT in ARCHES 
had a high baseline level of quality of  life, which was maintained over time.  
Based on the safety information collected to date in clinical trials and in commercial use, the 
safety profile experienced by [CONTACT_864738] s een in patients with prostate cancer.  The safety profile in mHSPC 
patients in this study is expected to be consistent with the established safety profile for 
enzalutamide.  To date, there are 4 important identified risks associated with enzalutamide 
(seizure, fall, nonpathological fracture  and ischemic heart disease).  While serious adverse 
events (SAEs) such as seizure have occurred in patients receiving treatment with 
enzalutamide, these events have been rare.   To mitigate the risk of seizure, subjects wi th a 
history of seizure or any condition that may predispose to seizure (e.g., prior cortical stroke  
or significant brain trauma , brain arteriovenous malformation) are excluded from the trial.  
Study drug discontinuation is required for subjects experienci ng either seizure or PRES.  In 
addition to these patient exclusion and discontinuation requirements, the study design 
includes safety labs, scans and guidance related to concomitant medications to minimize the 
risks associated with enzalutamide and ensure timely intervention if needed.  
Based on the information known about the drug and the efficacy results that have been 
consistently demonstrated in both PREVAIL and AFFIRM, the risk -benefit assessment 
supports the investigation of enzalutamide plus ADT in me n with mCRPC who are hormone 
sensitive.  As described in Section 10.1, a Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be 
responsible for reviewing the unblinded data f rom the trial to ensure the safety of the 
subjects. 
The totality of the efficacy and safety data demonstrate  a favorable  benefit-risk balance for 
the use of enzalutamide in men with mCRPC and for the continued investigation  of 
enzalutamide in men with advanced stage prostate cancer.

Version 5.1 Incorporating Nonsubstantial Amendment 6 2.2 Study Design and Dose Rationale  
2.2.1 Study Design  
This is a multinational phase 3, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled efficacy and 
safety study of enzalutamide plus ADT versus placebo plus ADT in subjects with mHSPC.  
Approximately 1100 subjects will be randomized centrally 1:1, and the randomization will be 
stratified by [CONTACT_864721] (low versus high) and prior docetaxel therapy for prostate 
cancer (no prior docetaxel, 1 -5 cycles, 6 cycles).  High volume of diseas e is defined as 
metastases involving the viscera or, in the absence of visceral lesions, there must be [ADDRESS_1205933] is tolerating the study drug and 
continues ADT until radiographic disease progression is documented as outlined in 
[Section [IP_ADDRESS] Computed Tomography (CT)/Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Bone 
Scan] or starting an investigational agent or new therapy for treatment of prostat e cancer.  It 
is recommended that subjects remain on study treatment until radiographic progression is 
confirmed by [CONTACT_23671].  Subjects who discontinue study treatment 
without radiographic progression will continue to follow the r adiographic assessment 
schedule until radiographic progression event is confirmed by [CONTACT_864744] .  All subjects will be followed for OS until the final OS analysis.  Once 
the final number of events has been reached to trigger the final OS analysis, survival follow -
up will be considered complete and subjects will be discontinued from long term follow -up.  
At the time of primary endpoint analysis and recommendation of the DSMB on study 
continuation, subjects may be asked to continue their open -label treatment in another 
Astellas-sponsored study . 
Study films (CT/MRI and bone scan) should be read on site and also be submitted in digital 
format to the sponsor-designated facility for independent central review.  Each site should 
ideally designate the same reader who will evaluate the images for any one subject for the 
duration of the trial.  
Radiographic disease progression is defined by [CONTACT_864745] e Evaluation Criteria in Solid 
Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 for soft tissue disease or the appearance of 2 or more new 
lesions on bone scan.  The documentation and confirmation required for the determination of 
radiographic progression is listed in [Section  [IP_ADDRESS] CT/MRI and Bone Scan].  
The following assessments of prostate cancer status will be collected during the course of the 
study: PSA, soft tiss ue disease on CT scan or on MRI, bone disease on radionuclide bone 
scans, survival status, EQ-5D-5L, QLQ-PR25, FACT -P for QoL and BPI -SF for pain 
symptom assessment.  Once the final number of events has been reached to trigger the final 
OS analysis, sites w ill no longer be required to collect EQ -5D-5L, QLQ-PR25, FACT -P for 
QoL and BPI -SF.

accordance with the protocol, and;  
● that any unused study drug is returned to the sponsor, unless prior approval is received 
from the sponsor allowing local standard procedures for the alternative disposition of 
unused study drug.  
Drug inventory  and accountability records for the study drugs will be kept  by [CONTACT_1275], head of study site  (specific to sites in Japan) or designee. Study drug 
accountability throughout the study must be documented and reconciled. The following 
guidelines are therefore pertinent:  
● The investigator, head of study site (specific to sites in Japan) or designee agr ees not to 
supply study drugs to any person s except the eligible subjects in this study in accordance 
with the protocol.  
● The investigator, head of study site (specific to sites in Japan) or designee will store and 
take accountability of the study drugs in conforming to the procedures for handling the 
study drugs as written by [CONTACT_456]. 
● The investigator, head of study site (specific to sites in Japan) or designee will prepare 
and retain records of the study drug’s receipt, the inventory at the study site,  the use by

possible to reconcile delivery records with those of used and/or returned medication.   
Any discrepancies must be accounted for and documented. Appropriate forms of deliveries 
and returns must be signed by [CONTACT_779] s taff delegated for this responsibility.  
4.4 Blinding 
This is a double -blind study.  Subjects will be randomized to receive enzalutamide or placebo 
in a double -blind fashion such that neither the investigator, sponsor’s study management 
team, clinical staff, nor the subject will know which agent is being administered.  The 
randomization number will be assigned based on information obtained from the Interactive 
Response Technology (IRT).  
4.4.1 Blinding Method  
For the purpose of this study, the efficacy and safety of enzalutamide and placebo will be 
compared in a double -blind manner.  Enzalutamide 40  mg capsule and placebo will be 
indistinguishable from one another in appearance, and packaging for each treatment  group 
will also be indistinguishable from one another in appearance.

Version 5.1 Incorporating Nonsubstantial Amendment 6 5 TREATMENTS  AND EVALUATION  
5.1 Dosing and Administra tion of Study Drug(s) and Other 
Medication(s)  
5.1.1 Dose/Dose Regimen and Administration Period  
Study drug consists  of enzalutamide provided as 40  mg capsules to be taken as 160  mg 
(4 capsules) orally once daily or matching placebo.  Study drug is to be taken un til disease 
progression, unacceptable toxicity or any other discontinuation criteria are met.  
Subjects who are continuing to receive clinical benefit from treatment with  enzalutamide 
after the OS analysis data cutoff or at study termination  and have not me t any discontinuation 
criteria may continue their open -label treatment in another Astellas -sponsored study . 
Study drug will be self -administered at home by [CONTACT_864756].  Study drug can be taken with or without food.  Subjects should 
not make up missed or vomited doses; dosing should resume the following day unless 
otherwise instructed.  
5.1.2 Increase or Reduction in Dose of the Study Drug(s)  
During the study, subjects who experience a National Cancer Institute (NCI) -Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event s (CTCAE) guidelines ( version 4.03) grade 3 or 
higher AE (except liver function test [LFT] AE) toxicity that is attributed to the study drug 
and cannot be ameliorated  by [CONTACT_864728]/or dose reduction 
may interrupt study drug treatment for 1  week or until the toxicity grade improves to grade  2 
or lower in severity.  Study drug may be restarted at the original dose (160 mg/day) or a 
reduced dose (120  mg or 80 mg/day) .  If restarted at a lower dose or if interrupted for

Version 5.1 Incorporating Nonsubstantial Amendment 6 [IP_ADDRESS] Enzalutamide Drug Interaction  
There is a potential for enzalutamide to affect exposures to other medicinal products, or for 
other medicinal products to affect exposure to enzalutamide:  
● Strong CYP2C8 inhibitors (e.g., gemfibrozil) are to be avoided . If subject must be 
coadministered a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor, the dose of enzal utamide should be reduced 
to 80 mg once daily . If coadministration of the stro ng inhibitor is discontinued, the 
enzalutamide dose should be return ed to the dose used prior to initiation of the strong 
CYP2C8 inhibitor.  
● Strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. , carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampin) or 
moderate CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. , bosentan, efavirenz, etravirine, modafinil, nafcilin, St. 
John’s Wort) should be avoided if possible as they may reduce enzalutamide plasma 
concentration if coadministered. Selection of a concomitant medication with no or 
minimal CYP3A4 induction potential is recommended.  
● Enzalutamide is a strong inducer of CYP3A4 and a mo derate inducer of CYP2C9 and 
CYP2C19 . Medicinal products with a narrow therapeutic range that are substrates of 
CYP3A4 (e.g. , alfentanil, cyclosporine, dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, fentanyl, 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_3924], q uinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus), CYP2C9 (e.g., phen ytoin, warfarin), or 
CYP2C19, or UGT1A1 (e.g., S -mephenytoin) should be avoided if possible, as 
enzalutamide may decrease their exposure.  
● If enzalutamide coadministration with warfarin cannot be avoided, additional INR 
monitoring should be conducted.  
● Enzalutamide is an inhibitor of human P-glycoprotein ( P-gp) and may increase exposure 
to medicines that are P -gp substrates . Medicinal products with a narrow therapeutic 
range that are substrates for P -gp (e.g., digoxin, colchicine, dabigatran etexilate) s hould 
be used with caution when administered concomitantly with enzalutamide.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Permitted  Concomitant Treatment  
The following  treatments are allowed during the study (and do not require study drug 
discontinuation) including, but not limited to:  
● Blood transfusions  and growth factor support per SOC and institutional guidelines;  
● Steroid use (for indication other than prostate cancer) per SOC; 
● Pain therapy per SOC and institutional guidelines;  
● Palliative r adiation therapy including external beam radiotherapy or system ic 
radionuclides (e.g., Samarium or Strontium);  
● Vaccine therapy that has prior market authorization  and is not intended to treat prostate 
cancer; 
● Palliative surgical procedures to treat skeletal -related events.  
Hormonal treatment for treating complication s of LHRH analogue treatment (e.g., hot flashes) 
will be allowed with Medical Monitor approval.  In addition, flutamide, bicalutamide or 
nilutamide are permitted if given concurrently with LHRH agonist or antagonist to prevent 
flare.

Version 5.1 Incorporating Nonsubstantial Amendment 6 5.1.4 Treatment Compliance  
Study subjects should be counseled on the need to meet 100% compliance with study drug  
unless study drug is withheld for a toxicity .  Investigator or designee should ensure that study 
subjects meet this goal throughout the study period.   Compliance will be verified by [CONTACT_864757].   When study drug is administered at the research facility, it will be 
administered under the supervision of study personnel.   If compliance is less than 80% and 
study drug was not withheld and there were no study d rug reductions, the investigator or

laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
(investigation al) product, whether or not related to the medic inal (investigational) product.  
Some countries may have additional local requirements for events that are required to be 
reported as AEs or in a n expedited manner similar to a SAE. In these cases, it is the 
investigator’s responsibility to ensure these AEs or other reporting requirements are followed 
and the information is appropriately recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF)  
accordingl y. 
An abnormality identified during a medical test (e.g., laboratory parameter, vital sign, ECG 
data, physical examination) should be defined as an AE only if the abnormality meets 1 of the 
following criteria:  
● Induces clinical signs or symptoms;  
● Requires active intervention;  
● Requires interruption or discontinuation of study medication ; 
● The abnormality or investigation al value is clinically significant in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1070]. 
Clinical signs or symptoms of disease progression will be recorded as AEs. However, disease 
progression itself should not be recorded as an AE unless the disease progression results in 
death; this event is recorded as an AE with ‘disease progression’ as the reported term.

Version 5.1 Incorporating Nonsubstantial Amendment 6 5.5.2 Definition of S erious Adverse Events 
An AE is conside red “serious” if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, it results in 
any of the following outcomes:   
● Results in death;  
● Is life threatening (an AE is considered “life -threatening” if, in the view of either the 
investigator or sponsor, its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of death . It 
does not include an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused 
death); 
● Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
ability to co nduct normal life functions;  
● Results in congenital anomaly, or birth defect;  
● Requires in -subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (except for planned procedures as allowed per study) 
or leads to prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (except if prolongation of planned 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_864704]).  H ospi[INVESTIGATOR_106306]/observation/examination caused by [CONTACT_610910];  
● Other medically important events.  
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedite d reporting 
is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_689917] 1 of the other outcome s listed in the definition 
above.  These events, including those that may result in disability/incapacity, should also 
usually be considered serious. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm;  blood dyscrasias or convulsions that 
do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.   
Safety events of interest on the medicinal products administered to the subject as part of the 
study (e.g., study drug, comparator  and background therapy) that may require expedited 
reporting and/or safety evaluation include, but are not limited to:  
● Overdose of the medicinal product(s);  
● Suspected abuse/misuse of the medicinal product(s);  
● Inadvertent or accidental exposure to the medicina l product(s);  
● Medication error involving the medicinal product(s) (with or without subject/ subject 
exposure to the sponsor medicinal product, e.g., name [CONTACT_2976]).  
All of the special situations noted above should be recorded on the eCRF. Any situation 
involving these events that also meets the criteria for an SAE should be recorded on the AE 
page of the eCRF and marked ‘serious’ on the SAE worksheet /report. 
The sponsor has a list of events that they classify as “always serious” events. If an AE is 
reported that is considered to be an event per this classification as “always serious,” 
additional information on the event may be requested.

explained by [CONTACT_9153]. Information 
on drug withdrawal may be lacking or unclear.  
Probable A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable

Common SAEs are SAEs commonly ant icipated to occur in the study population independent 
of drug exposure.  SAEs classified as “common” are provided in [ Appendix  12.3 Common 
Serious Adverse Events]  for reference . The list does NOT change the investigator’s reporting 
obligations or prevent the need to report an AE meeting the definition of an SAE as detaile d 
above.  The purpose of this list is to note that some events reported as SAEs may not require 
expedited reporting to the regulatory authorities based on the classification of “common 
SAEs” as specified in [ Appendix 12.3 Common Serious Adverse Events] .  The sponsor will 
monitor these events throughout the course of the study for any change in frequency . Any 
changes to this list will be communicated to the participating investigational sites.  
Investigators must report individual occurrences of these events as stated in [Section  5.5.5 
Reporting of Serious Adve rse Events].

7 STATISTICAL METHODOL OGY 
The statistical analysis will be coordinat ed by [CONTACT_864770].  A 
statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be written to provide details of the analysis, along with 
specifications for tables, listings and figures to be produced .  The SAP will be finalized 
Sponsor: APGD  ISN/Protocol [ADDRESS_1206007] .  Any changes from the analyses planned in SAP will be 
justified in the clinical study report.  
Prior to database lock, a Final Review of Data and Tables, Listings and Figures Meeting will 
be held to allow a review of the clinical t rial data and to verify the data that will be used for 
analysis set classification .  If required, consequences for the statistical analysis wil l be 
discussed and documented.  A meeting to determine analysis set classifications may also be 
held prior to dat abase lock.  
In general, all data will be summarized with descriptive statistics (number of subjects, mean, 
standard deviation, minimum, median and maximum) for continuous endpoints, and 
frequency and percentage for categorical endpoints.  
7.1 Sample Size  
As originally planned, approximately 1100 subjects (550 subjects per treatment arm) will be 
randomized in the study.  
The final analysis of rPFS will be conducted with a minimum of 262 progression events 
based on the following considerations:   
● A target HR is 0.67.  The expected median rPFS for the ADT arm is 20 months as 
measured from the date of randomization . A target HR of 0.67 corresponds to 
approximately  50% increase in median rPFS for the enzalutamide plus ADT arm relative 
to the placebo plus ADT arm (approximately 30 versus 20 months). 
● The required minimum of 262 rPFS events (radiographic progression or death on study, 
defined as death from any cause withi n [ADDRESS_1206008]) provides 90% power to detect a target HR of 0.[ADDRESS_1206009] and significance level of 0.05 .  
Additionally the study is powered for OS.  Specifically, 342 death events  will be required to 
provide 80% power to detect a target hazard ration of 0.73 with a target difference in 
Kaplan-Meier estimated median of approximately 15 months (40 months for placebo versus 
55 months for enzalutamide) at the 4% significance level.  This significance level was chosen 
to apply a parallel testing strategy between OS and some other secondary endpoints (with 
allocated type I error rate of 1%) as described in Section 7.4.2.

study.  The ITT population will be analyzed by [CONTACT_150045] (i.e., treatment 
arm based on randomization assignment) . The ITT population wi ll be used to conduct 
efficacy analyses . For the ORR, only subjects with measurable disease at baseline will be 
included in the analysis.

study drug.  The safety population will be analyzed by [CONTACT_221432] (i.e., based on 
the treatment the subject actually received rather than the treatment to which the subject was 
randomized) . The safety population will be used to conduct safety analys es. 
7.[ADDRESS_1206012] objective evidence of radiographic 
disease progression as assessed by [CONTACT_864732] (defined as death from any cause 
within 24 weeks from study drug discontinuation), whichever occurs first.  
Radiographic disease progression is defined as progressive disease by [CONTACT_44993] 1.[ADDRESS_1206013] at the level of significance of 0.05 (2 -sided).  The benefit of enzalutamide plus 
ADT compared to ADT will be summarized by a single HR with its 95% CI base d on the 
Cox regression model. Kaplan-Meier curves will be used to estimate the distribution of the 
duration of rPFS.  Median duration of rPFS will be estimated using the corresponding 5 0% 
percentile of the Kaplan -Meier estimates. A 2-sided 95% CI will be provided for these 
estimates.  
The analysis will be conducted when at least [ADDRESS_1206014] occurred.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Subgroup Analysis  
Subgroup analyses of rPFS will be conducted to assess the cons istency of the treatmen t effect 
across the subgroups.  
7.4.2 Analysis of Secondary Endpoints  
All secondary endpoint analyses will be performed at the time of the rPFS final analysis.  
The following  6 secondary endpoints will be tested:  OS, time to PSA progressio n (TTPSA), 
time to initiation of a  new antineoplastic therapy  (TTNAnti), the r ate of PSA decline to 
< 0.2ng/mL (PSADecR) , the objective response rate  (ORR) and time to deterioration in 
urinary symptoms  (TTUri).  A parallel testing strategy between OS (with allocated type I 
error rate 0.04) and th e other 5 endpoints (with allocated type I error rate 0.0 1) will be 
performed , as summarized in Figure 2.

for this endpoint.  Time to initiation of a new antineoplastic therapy is defined as the time 
from randomization to the initiation of antineoplastic subsequent to the study treatments.   The 
analysis method will be the same as for rPFS.  
Time to PSA progression:  
Time to PSA progression is defined as a ≥  25% increase and an absolute increase of 
≥ 2 ng/mL above the nadir (i .e., lowest PSA value observed postbaseline or at baseline),

and follow -up. 
Follow-up Procedures  
Confirmed moderate or severe abnormalities in hepatic functions should be thoroughly 
characterized by [CONTACT_317257], detailed pertinent history, 
physical examination and laboratory tests.  The site should complete the liver ab normality 
case report form (LA -CRF) that has been developed globally and can be activated for any 
study, or appropriate document . Subjects with confirmed abnormal LFTs should be followed 
as described below.  
Confirmed moderately abnormal LFTs should be rep eated 2-[ADDRESS_1206058] is 
asymptomatic.   
Severe hepatic liver function abnormalities as defined above, in the absence of another 
etiology may be conside red an important medical event and may be reported as an SAE . The

Version 5.1 Incorporating Nonsubstantial Amendment 6 Sponsor should be contact[CONTACT_864782].  
To further assess abnormal hep atic laboratory findings, the investigator is expected to:  
● Obtain a more detailed history of symptoms and prior or concurrent diseases . Symptoms 
and new onset -diseases should be recorded as ‘AEs’ on the AE page of eCRF . Illnesses 
and conditions such as hyp otensive events, and decompensated cardiac disease that may 
lead to secondary liver abnormalities should be noted . Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis 
(NASH) is seen in obese hyperlipoproteinemic, and/or diabetic subjects and may be 
associated with fluctuating am inotransferase levels . The investigator should ensure that 
the medical history form captures any illness that predates study enrollment that may be 
relevant in assessing hepatic function.     
● Obtain a history of concomitant drug use (including nonprescription medication, 
complementary and alternative medications), alcohol use, recreational drug use and 
special diets.  Medications, including dose, should be entered on the concomitant 
medication page of the eCRF . Information on alcohol, other subs tance use and diet 
should be entered on the LA -CRF or an appropriate document.  
● Obtain a history of exposure to environmental chemical agents.  
● Based on the subject’s history, other testing may be appropriate including:  
○ acute viral hepatitis (A, B, C, D, E or other infectious agents).  
○ ultrasound or other imaging to assess biliary tract disease  
○ other laboratory tests including INR, direct bilirubin  
● Consider gastroenterology or hepatology consultations.  
● Submit results for any additional testing and possible e tiology on the LA -CRF or an 
appropriate document.  
Study Discontinuation  
In the absence of a n explanation for increased LFT s, such as viral hepatitis, preexisting or 
acute liver disease, presence of liver metastases, or exposure to other agents associated w ith 
liver injury, the subject may be discontinued from the study . The investigator may determine 
that it is not in the subject’s best interest to continue study enrollment . Discontinuation of 
treatment should be considered if:  
● ALT or AST > 8 × ULN; 
● ALT or AST > 5 × ULN for more than 2 weeks (in subjects without liver metastases);  
● ALT or AST > 3 × ULN and TBL > 2 × ULN or INR > 1.5 (If INR testing is 
applicable/evaluated);  
● ALT or AST > 5 × ULN and (TBL > 2 × ULN in subjects with liver metastases);  
● ALT or AST  > 3 × ULN with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper 
quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash and/or eosinophilia (> 5%).  
In addition, if close monitoring for a subject with moderate or severe hepatic laboratory tests 
is not possible, drug should be discontinued.

NOTE:  The extension study described below and outlined in Figure [ADDRESS_1206072] and investigator.  
Day 1 of the open -label extension will occur after consent is signed and eligibility is 
confirmed.  Treatment with open -label enzalutamide will be stopped upon disease 
progression when, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], there is no added clinical benefit to 
continue treatment with enzalutamide, and/or when discontinuation criteria are met 
[Section 12.6.6 Duration of Treatment and C riteria for Discontinuation ]. 
Subjects who do not participate in the open -label extension or who withdraw consent for 
further treatment will discontinue study treatment and return for a 30 -day safety follow -up 
visit as per protocol.  Long -term follow -up assessments will be completed as per protocol.  
12.6.2 Schedule and Assessments  
For procedures see Table 4 (Open-Label Extension Schedule of Assessments).  
Subjects treated with  enzalutamide during the double -blind period will sign informed consent 
on Open-Label Day 1 and are required to return for study visits every 12 weeks (see Figure 3 
Open-Label Extension schematic).  Subjects treated with placebo during the double -blind 
period will sign informed consent at the Open -Label Day 1 visit after which they will be 
switched to enzalutamide (dosing below); these subjects will be required to re turn for study 
visits at Open -Label Week 5 (Day 29), Week 13 and every subsequent 12 weeks.  All 
Open-Label Day 1 visits should occur within approximately 16  weeks after the approval and 
activation of this protocol amendment at the study site.  
Subjects wil l take enzalutamide as four 40 -mg soft gelatin capsules (160 mg/day) by [CONTACT_864785].  Subjects treated with enzalutamide during the double -blind 
period and dosed at a lower daily dose may continue at the lower dose as appropriate.  
Study assessments will include safety evaluations including AEs, concomitant medications, 
clinical laboratory tests, brief physical examinations, ECGs and vital signs.  Radiographic 
assessments (CT/MRI and bone scan) will be performed as per  the Open-Label Extension 
Schedule of Assessments  [Table 4] until the subject progresses radiographically based on 
local assessment and/or meets other treatment discontinuation cri teria [Section  12.6.6 
Duration of Treatment and Criteria for Discontinuation ]. 
Sponsor: APGD  ISN/Protocol [ADDRESS_1206073] dose of open -label enzalutamide, then safety follow -up should occur immediately 
before starting the new treatment.  
Long-term follow -up data will be collected every 12 weeks  until the completion of OS 
analysis.  The information collected will include survival status, new antineoplastic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_864707], skeletal -related events and associated interventions.

Version 5.1 Incorporating Nonsubstantial Amendment 6 12.7 Clinical Study Continuity   
INTRODUCTION  
The purpose of this appendix is to provide acceptable alternate methods to assess safety and 
efficacy parameters, as appropriate, in the event the c linical study is interrupted at the 
country, state, site or participant level during any crisis (e.g., natural disaster, pandemic).  
BENEFIT -RISK RATIONA LE 
Maintaining the safety of clinical study participants and delivering continuity of care in the 
clinical study setting is paramount during any crisis. The site is expected to follow the 
protocol and associated Schedule of Assessments/ Table 1 unless the site princ ipal 
investigator discusses the need with the Astellas Medical Monitor to implement the alternate 
measures.  
The approach outlined within this appendix defines which assessments are required to 
maintain a favorable benefit/risk to the participant, to maintain overall study integrity and to 
provide acceptable alternate methods to complete the study required assess ments and 
procedures if study activities are unable to be performed as described in Section [ADDRESS_1206093] followed by [CONTACT_864792]. A 
separate addendum to the study informed consent will be provided to document the 
participant’s consent of the changes . 
PARTICIPANT  PROCEDURES ASSESSMENT  
Sites with participants who are currently enrolled into this  clinical study may consider 
implementing the alternate methods outlined below if one or more of the following 
conditions are met due to the crisis:   
● Regional or local travel has been restricted, inclu sive of mandatory shelter in place 
measures, which makes participant travel to/from the study site nearly impossible  
● Site facilities have been closed for clinical study conduct   
● Site has been restricted to treating patients with conditions outside of the s cope of the 
study 
● Site personnel have temporarily relocated the conduct of the study to a location that 
place a burden on the participant with respect to time and travel  
● Participant(s) have temporarily relocated from the current study site to an alternate study 
site avoid placing a burden on the participant with respect to travel

Version 5.1 Incorporating Nonsubstantial Amendment 6 ● Participant(s) have temporarily relocated from their home location and the new distances 
from the site would cause undue burden with respect to time and travel  
● Participant has risk  factors for which traveling to the site poses an additional risk to the 
participant’s health and safety  
Adherence to the original protocol as reflected in the Schedule of Assessment Table [ADDRESS_1206095]  and maintaining critical safety and

physical/mental integrity of participants nor the scientific value of the study.  
Overall Rationale for the Amendment:  
To extend the planned study period to the first quarter o f 2024. 
Summary of Changes

Committee: Medical IRB [ADDRESS_365984]:  
Perception of pain during surgical abortion is nuanced and affected by [CONTACT_299843] —notably the experience of anxiety —which can significantly increase perceived pain 
during abortion. It is found that women who suffer from anxiety are more likely to experience greater 
pain during gynecological procedures. Furthermore, pain management in the setting of gynecologic 
procedures is complex. While local anesthesia is commonly used, studies suggest that multimodal 
approaches m ay be more effective methods of pain management during gynecological procedures. 
However, the application of non -pharmacological pain and anxiety control adjuncts during gynecological 
procedures is not well studied, especially with regards to first -trimest er surgical abortion. Recent 
innovation in virtual reality (VR) has generated increased interest in its potential use as an innovative and 
non-invasive method for managing patient anxiety and subsequently decreasing acute pain. Our work will 
assess the pra cticality and qualitative experiences of women using VR during first -trimester surgical 
abortion at the University of [LOCATION_004] Los Angeles West -Medical Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinic. 
Through this mixed method pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we will evaluate the feasibil ity of using VR and its effect on 
procedure -related anxiety in the setting of first -trimester surgical abortion. Our work ultimately seeks to 
improve the experience of women undergoing first -trimester surgical abortion.  
 
BACKGROUND:  
a) Rationale:  
Percept ion of pain and anxiety in first trimester surgical abortion  
Most women experience moderate to severe pain during first -trimester surgical abortion despi[INVESTIGATOR_299838].1, [ADDRESS_365985] that multimodal approaches, such as visual or auditory 
distraction, oral medication, and emotional support may be more effective methods of pain management 
during gynecological procedures.7

Figure 1. Example of Virtual Reality Headset  
Virtual reality (VR) is a three -dimensional experience created by a headset fitted with a video 
display. The device, designed to be worn on the face, immerses the viewer in a virtual world and can 
create a visual and a uditory distraction from the patient’s present situation ( Figure 1 ). VR devices are 
easily portable, intuitive to use, and non -invasive. Recent innovation in VR has generated increased 
interest in its potential use as a non -pharmacological adjunct for mana ging patient anxiety and 
subsequently decreasing acute pain.  
Previous Studies  and Scientific Significance  
Studies have shown that VR is effective in reducing anxiety among a range of patients in 
differing circumstances, from patients undergoing dental pro cedures to patients undergoing 
chemotherapy.8, [ADDRESS_365986] -
trimester abortion has n ot been studied, and it is worthy of further research.  
 
b) Objectives and Specific Aims:  
1. Assess the feasibility of using VR during first trimester surgical abortion under local anesthesia :  

Protocol ID: IRB#17 -001122     UCLA IRB Approved     Approval Date : 12/13/2017     Through: 11/29/2018 
Committee: Medical IRB [ADDRESS_365987] trimester 
surgical abortion under local anesthesia. Semi -structured interviews will be conducted to understand the 
patient’s experience of using VR.  
 
2. Unders tand the effect of VR on procedure -related anxiety during first trimester surgical abortion :  
We will analyze the anxiety scores of women before and after surgical abortion with the use of VR. In 
order to obtain an effect size for future studies, we will enroll a control group of patients receiving 
standard care and compare the anxiety scores betwe en the two groups. The mean and standard deviation 
of anxiety scores for each group will be used to calculate power for future studies.  
 
RESEARCH METHODS AND DESIGN  
i) Trial Design/Sample Size:  
We will conduct a mixed method pi[INVESTIGATOR_299839] -trimester surgical abortion.  
Specific aim 1:  We will enroll a convenient sample of [ADDRESS_365988] on anxiety and p ain. The interviews will be audio -recorded for analysis. We 
believe that this sample size will allow us to obtain thematic saturation to analyze patients’ experiences.  
Specific aim 2:  After enrollment of the experimental group, we will enroll [ADDRESS_365989] size. This data will help power 
further studies to determin e the significance of VR on anxiety management.  
ii) Participants:  
We will screen patients over [ADDRESS_365990].  
iii) Study setting:  
Protocol ID: IRB#17 -001122     UCLA IRB Approved     Approval Date : 12/13/2017     Through: 11/29/2018 
Committee: Medical IRB [ADDRESS_365991] year (from 1/1/2016 to 12/31/2016), has helped women receive a total of [ADDRESS_365992] ease of 
enrollment.  
iv) Virtual Reality:  
We will use a commercially available VR device, comprised of a phone, headset and hea dphones. 
The phone is inserted into the headset to act as the visual display that can create different three 
dimensional environments. The device will require a wireless internet connection to work effectively. The 
patient will choose the virtual reality e xperience she prefers. More information about VR can be found at: 
appliedvr.zendesk.com  
v) Outcome measurements:  
We will collect standard demographic information (age, pregnancy history, ethnicity, race, 
educational and income level) from all participants  using standard cross sectional survey. For each patient 
who has used the VR experience during the procedure, a pi[INVESTIGATOR_299840] (Appendix A) will 
be administered after the recovery period. We will conduct a qualitative semi -structured intervi ew in a 
private room (Appendix B). Audio -recordings of the patient’s experience will be collected.  
Anxiety scores: To assess the effect of VR on managing anxiety, we will measure the patient’s 
perceived anxiety through survey scoring. Preoperatively, two surveys will be administered —a modified 
Amsterdam Preoperative Anxiety and Information Scale (modified APAIS) (Appendix C) and a visual 
analog scale for anxiety (numerical score with  0=minimum score 10 =maximum score) (Appendix D). 
The visual analog scale will again be used after the procedure.  
vi) Statistical analysis:  
In our qualitative analysis, interviews will be recorded and transcribed verbatim, and analyzed for 
thematic content using the Dedoose online software platform.  Two members of the researc h team will 
code each transcript independently, with discrepancies resolved by [CONTACT_21128].  For the quantitative 
component, the VAS scores, descriptive analysis using means and proportions for each variable of interest 
will be performed. Patterns of missing  data will be assessed and imputation methods will be considered if 
appropriate. We will use mean and standard deviations for each group to detect the effect size for future 
studies.

Evaluation of EverLift in the Performance of Polypectomy for 
Polyps 4-9mm 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
May 4, [ADDRESS_221538], [LOCATION_004] [ZIP_CODE]  
1. PURPOSE OF THE STUDY  
a. Brief Summary 
It is important to optimize complete resection of polyps as residual tissue may play a role in interval 
cancers. The US  Multi- Society Task Force recommends diminutive ( <5 mm) and small (6 –9 mm) polyps 
be removed by [CONTACT_187755] (CSP). Use of viscous su bmucosal agents has not been evaluated in 
CSP. In this trial, we investigate the potential role of EverLiftTM (GI Supply, Pennsylvania) in CSP.  
b. Objectives  
This study is a single -center , prospective noninferiority randomized clinical trial evaluating CSP for 
nonpedunculated polyps 4-[ADDRESS_221539] medically indicated endoscopic procedure will be 
performed. 
f. Will it be possible to continue the more (most) appropriate therapy for the participant(s) 
after the conclusion of the study? 
Yes. All patients will continue to receive their appropriate medical therapy.  
g. Study Endpoint (s) 
The primary outcome measured was completeness of resection , defined as absence of polyp tissue in both 
polypectomy site margin biopsies. This outcome was tested for noninferiority. Secondary outcomes included 
polypectomy time, number of snare attempts for polyp removal, use of hemostatic clips, complication rates .  
3. BACKGROUND  
a. Past Experimental and/or Clinical Findings  
There is limited data looking at use of submucosal injection in polyps <10mm. In work 
by [CONTACT_187756] 2018 evaluating CSP of polyps 6-9mm with or without submucosal injection of normal saline/epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]/indigo carmine, incomplete resection rate was significantly lower in the group with submucosal injection. However, in 2020 Shimodate compared CSP with or without submucosal injection of normal saline/indigo carmine/epi[INVESTIGATOR_187752] 3-10mm. In this study, there was no difference in rates of complete muscularis mucosal resection.  To date, there has been no study evaluating 
viscous submucosal lifting agents.

7. PARTICIPANT POPULATION  
a. Planned Enrollment 
Papastergiou et al found that cold snare endoscopic mucosal resection of polyps 
6-10mm had complete resection 92.8% of polypectomies. Using this data, in our sample size calculation we determined  115 polyps would be needed in each group 
to achieve an alpha value of 0.05, power of 90%, and non- inferiority margin of -
10%.  
b. Age, Gender, and Ethnic Background 
Age > 18, including all genders and ethnic backgrounds.

No vulnerable subjects.

ii. Exclusion Criteria 
Patients <18 or >80; patients with inflammatory bowel disease or polyposis syndromes; patients who did not have consent form; patients in whom polyps were not removed.

j. Participation in Multiple Protocols  
We will ask all patients if they are participating in any other studies. If they are participating in any other studies then we will ask them for more information to determine whether there could be any harm from 
partici pating in both studies and if there is then they will not be enrolled.

iv. Procedures 
There is a very low (< 1 in 5000) risk of perforation of the gastrointestinal tract and a low (< 1 in 1000) risk 
of bleeding during the study portion of  the endoscopy. There is a very low risk of an adverse event from the 
blood draw (< 1 in 1000). There is a very low risk of an adverse event from biopsies of resection site (<1 in 
1000 risk of bleeding, <1 in 1000 risk of infection). There is a very low ri sk of adverse event from 
polypectomy of a small polyp - there is no evidence to suggest either technique (cold snare or cold biopsy) is 
safer than the other.

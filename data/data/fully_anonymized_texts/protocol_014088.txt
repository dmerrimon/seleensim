2. INTRODUCTION: BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND SCIENTIFIC 
RATIONALE 
2.1 BACKGROUND INFORMATION  & RATIONALE  
Energy has been applied in some form to tissue since the beginning of recorded history.  The practic e of applying 
heat to tissue through the use of cauteries was used for thousands of years as an invaluable method of controlling 
hemorrhage.  Continuous improvement of methods for utilizing the beneficial effects of heat on tissue eventually 
led to the dev elopment of the basic concepts of electrosurgery we know today.  In October of 1926, [CONTACT_518465] used an electrosurgical unit developed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. William T. Bovie to successfully remove a highly vascularized brain tumor from a patient after previous failed attempts.  Today, electrosurgical instruments are used in almost 
every surgical procedure performed worldwide.
1 
Through this long history, the heat effects of the radiofrequency (RF) alternating current used in electrosurgery on 
cells and tissue have been well established.  Normal body temperature is 37°C and, with normal illness, can increase 
to 40°C without permanent impact or damage to the cells of our body.  However, when the temperature of cells in 
tissue reaches 50°C, cell death occurs in approximately 6 minutes.2  When the temperature of cells in tissue reaches 
60°C, cell death occurs instantaneously.3  Between the temperatures of 60°C and just below 100°C, two simultaneous 
processes occur.[ADDRESS_672476] is protein denaturation leading to coagulation which will be discussed in more detail 
below.  The second is desiccation or dehydration as the cells lose water through the thermally damaged cellular wall.  
As temperatures rise above 100°C, intracellular water turns to steam and tissue cells begin to vaporize as a result of 
the massive intracellular expansion that occurs.  Finally, at temperatures of 200°C o r more, organic molecules are 
broken down into a process called carbonization.  This leaves behind carbon molecules that give a black and/or 
brown appearance to the tissue.  
 Understanding these heat effects of RF energy on cells and tissue can allow the pr edictable changes to be used to 
accomplish beneficial therapeutic results.  Protein denaturation leading to soft tissue coagulation is one of the most 
versatile and widely utilized tissue effects.  Protein denaturation is the process in which hydrothermal bonds 
(crosslinks) between protein molecules, such as collagen, are instantaneously broken and then quickly reformed as 
tissue cools.  This process leads to the formation of uniform clumps of protein typi[INVESTIGATOR_148061] a 
subsequent process k nown as coagulation.  In the process of coagulation, cellular proteins are altered but not 
destroyed and form protein bonds that create homogenous, gelatinous structures.  The resulting tissue effect of 
coagulation is extremely useful and most commonly use d for occluding blood vessels and causing hemostasis.  
 
In addition to causing hemostasis, coagulation results in predictable contraction of soft tissue.  Collagen is one of the 
main proteins found in human skin and connective tissue.  The coagulation/denat uration temperature of collagen is 
conventionally stated to be 66.8°C, although this can vary for different tissue types.
[ADDRESS_672477] been used for the reduction of facial w rinkles and rhytides caused by [CONTACT_148100] -induced collagen/tissue contraction 
since the mid -1990s.

Revision: [ADDRESS_672478] achieved the appropria te balance between excisional and non- invasive procedures.  Laser -
assisted liposuction (LAL) has shown to be effective at producing more skin tightening than suction- assisted 
liposuction (SAL) alone18,1 9.  DiBernardo showed an average skin surface area red uction of 22% and 17% at one - and 
three- month follow- up visits, respectively, and an average of 26% skin tightening at three months when utilizing LAL 
to address abdominal skin laxity20.  In 2008, radiofrequency (RF) devices were introduced and have demons trated 
efficacy in multiple body areas including the abdomen21,22, the arms23,24, and the face and neck25,26.  The efficacy 
results in all of these publications are based on contraction measurements taken on the surface of the skin.  Although skin surface contraction measurements are useful, they are limited for the following reasons:  
• The mechanism of action (especially of Renuvion) is to treat and contract the fibro septal connective tissue.  
This contraction of the connective tissue draws the skin closer to the underlying muscle, and this, in turn, 
improves the appearance of the skin by [CONTACT_518427].  When addressing skin laxity through the three -
dimensional contraction of the connective tissue, the overall magnitude of improvement may not al ways 
be reflected in surface area changes on the skin surface.  To date, no studies have measured the amount of 
contraction of the connective tissue itself.  
• Using camera -based measurements of skin surface area changes do not allow for quantification of intra -
operative (on the table) changes.  
• Using camera -based measurements of skin surface area changes requires split -body treatments to 
differentiate between the results produced by [CONTACT_518428].  
 
Due to these limitations, having another w ay to quantify and visualize contraction will be helpf ul. This study will use 
ultrasound images to visualize the contraction throughout the procedure and during follow -up. Utilizing those 
ultrasound images, this study will provide the ability to quantitati vely measure the amount of soft tissue contraction 
produced by [CONTACT_518429].  
 
2.1.1  RENUVION SYSTEM DEVICE AND INDICATIONS FOR USE 
The Renuvion APR system consists of a handpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959] (Figure 1), an electrosurgical unit (ESU, Figure 2), and a supply of 
helium gas (Figure 2).  RF energy is delivered to the handpi[INVESTIGATOR_506997].  When 
helium gas is passed over the energized  electrode, a helium plasma is generated which allows for conduction of the 
RF energy from the electrode to the subject in the form of a precise helium plasma beam.

7.[ADDRESS_672491] verification of eligibility criteria, a brief general examination including medical history, and 
pre-procedure assessments as detailed below completed within 30 days prior to undergoing the study procedure. 
In response to the ongoi ng coronavirus disease (COVID- 19) pandemic, preoperative testing can be completed at the 
Investigator’s discretion.  Pre -operative testing should be performed as close to the scheduled study procedure as 
feasible, but in time to get the results. Up to two urine pregnancy tests must be obtained prior to study procedure for females with child -bearing potential (one at pre -procedure screening and one on the day of the procedure prior 
to the procedure if pre- procedure screening and procedure are not performed o n the same day).  
The following pre -treatment assessments will be performed:  
• 2D photographic images will be captured. The same standardized photography views will be used 
throughout the study.   
• Urine pregnancy test (for females of childbearing potential).  
• General physical exam including medical history, vital signs, collection of patient demographic information, and BMI.  
 
Medications subject is taking upon entry into the study should also be documented in the Case Report Forms (CRF). All concomitant prescription medications taken during study participation will be recorded on the appropriate study 
specific CRF. For this pro tocol, a prescription medication is defined as a medication that can be prescribed only by a 
properly authorized/licensed clinician. Medications to be reported on the CRF and entered on the eCRF are 
concomitant prescription medications, over -the-counter me dications, and non- prescription medications.  
Medication used for analgesia and/or anesthesia should be recorded as concomitant medication as well. To ensure

The abdominal procedure utilizing the Renuvion APR system will be performed per the investigator’s standard 
clinical practice. Subjects may also have other body areas treated at the same ti me. Procedure data and adverse 
events will be captured.  
Ultrasound Measurements of the abdomen will be collected intra -operatively (pre- treatment, post- liposuction, post 
each Renuvion pass).  Video may be taken during the procedure.

7.3.2 FOLLOW -UP VISITS & SUBJECT CONTACT [CONTACT_518444] -UP VISITS 
The Investigator will follow- up with the study subjects per their Standard of Care (SOC), at the following time -points:  
• 30 (±4) days  
• 45 (±10) days  
• 60 (±10) days  
• 90 (±10) days  
• 180 (±15) days  
• 270 (±15) days  
• 365 (±15) days  
 
Post -procedure assessments, ultrasound imaging,  and 2D photographic imaging will be performed during the follow -
up visits, see Table 4. The same standardized photography views and ultrasound imaging will be used throughout 
the study as documented in the image capture document developed for the study.  
Due to the challenges of COVID- 19, if a subject is unable to return to the office for an in- person visit, follow- up visits 
will be conducted virtually. If a visit is completed virtually, missing assessments such as photographs will be 
documented as a protocol deviation specifically noting COVID -19. Outside of photographs, study investigators and 
study staff will ensure all other assessments related to eac h follow -up visit are completed virtually if the visit is done 
virtually. For virtual visits, the investigator and/or study staff completing the visit and assessments will be identified 
on the case report form; as well, the manner in which the visit was co mpleted will also be recorded (i.e., video call, 
phone call, etc.). Virtual visits should be done via video call, if possible, to ensure subject identity. If a telephone call  
must be done, the investigator and/or study staff must positively identify the su bject prior to conducting the virtual 
visit by [CONTACT_518445]. Subjects will be strongly encouraged to come 
in (albeit safely) for their D 365 visit; this visit is vitally important as this is the primary end point and photographic 
images are needed for many of the assessments. Only investigators and study staff who have been trained and 
delegated to conduct virtual visits as indicated on the delegation log may conduct virtual study visits.  
Subjects may be seen for an unscheduled appointment at any time at investigator’s discretion.  
Study staff will contact (phone, text, email, video call at subject’s preference) all subjects with ongoing Adverse 
Events at regular intervals. If the subject is unreachable by [CONTACT_148108], another method of 
contact [CONTACT_518446].

Revision: 0 3  Page 31 of 45 
A preexisting condition (one that is present at the start of the study) will be recorded as an AE only if the frequency, 
intensity, or the character of the condition worsens during the study period. Neither the condition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11298], 
prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], nor surgery are reported as an AE in the following circumstances: hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14841] a preexisting condition. Surgery should 
not be reported as  an outcome of an AE if the purpose of the surgery was elective or diagnostic and the outcome 
was uneventful.  
 
All ETEs and AEs will be collected during the conduct of this trial.   
8.1.2  DEFINITION OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT (SAE) 
Each adverse event should be assessed for its seriousness. The definition below should be used for this assessment. 
Please note that the term serious adverse event is not synonymous with a “severe” adverse event, which may be 
used to describe the intensity of an event experienced b y the subject.  
 
An adverse event should be classified as serious if it meets any of the following criteria:  
a. Death  
Death was an outcome of the adverse event.  
b. Life-threatening  
The subject was at substantial risk of dying at the time of the adverse event or  use or continued use of 
the device.  
c. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (initial or prolonged)  
Admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_274358] a result of the adverse event.  
d. Disability or Permanent Damage  
The adverse event resulted in a substantial disruptio n of a person's ability to conduct normal life 
functions, i.e., the adverse event resulted in a significant, persistent or permanent change, impairment, damage or disruption in the patient's body function/structure, physical activities and/or quality of li fe. 
e. Congenital Anomaly/Birth Defect  
Exposure to a medical product prior to conception or during pregnancy may have resulted in an adverse outcome in the child.  
f. Required Intervention to Prevent Permanent Impairment or Damage (Devices) 
Medical or surgical in tervention was necessary to preclude permanent impairment of a body function, 
or prevent permanent damage to a body structure, either situation suspected to be due to the use of 
a medical product.  
g. Other Serious (Important Medical Events)  
The event does not fit the other outcomes, but the event may jeopardize the subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention (treatment) to prevent one of the other outcomes.  
 Non -serious adverse events are all events that do not meet the criteria for a “serious”  adverse event.  
8.1.3  DEFINITION OF UNANTICIPATED ADVERSE DEVICE EFFECTS (EVENTS ) 
An unanticipated adverse device effect is defined as “any serious adverse effect on health or safety, or any life -
threatening problem, or death caused by, or associated with, a device; if that effect, problem, or death was not 
previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan, or application (including

8.[ADDRESS_672500], using 
the following classifications:  
 
• Mild:  easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423], causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with everyday 
activities. These events generally do not require treatment.  
• Moderate:  sufficiently discomforting to interfere wit h normal everyday activities.  These events are 
usually relieved by [CONTACT_14212].  
• Severe:   prevents normal, everyday activities.  These events may require systemic drug therapy or other 
medical treatment.  
8.2.2  RELATIONSHIP TO THE INVESTIGA TIONAL DEVICE  
The relationship to the study device and/or procedure will be determined by [CONTACT_518449]:  
• Not Related:  An event for which an alternative explanation is conclusively identified – e.g., concomitant 
drug(s), concomitant disease(s), and/or the relationship in time suggests that a causal relationship is highly unlikely.  
• Related: The adverse event follows a reas onable temporal sequence related to treatment by [CONTACT_518450]/or study procedure, follows a known or suspected response pattern and a plausible alternative etiology 
cannot be identified.  
• Undetermined: The relation of the adverse event has some temporal r elationship to the device and/or 
study procedure, is not clearly due to another condition and the involvement of the study device is 
unknown.  
8.3 TIME PERIOD AND FREQUENCY FOR EVENT ASSESSMENT AND FOLLOW -UP 
The occurrence of an AE or SAE may  come to the attention of study  personne l during a study visit or upon review by 
a study m onitor. All ETEs and A Es will be captured on the appropriate CRF. Information  to be collected includes event 
description, date  of onset, clinician’s assessment of seriousness and s everity, relationship to study device/treatment  
(assessed only by [CONTACT_8703] a determination ), actions taken, an d date of event 
resolution . All AEs occurring while on study must be documented appropriately regardless of relationship. All device 
related  ETEs/AEs assessed as “not yet resolved” must continue to be followed via telephone contact, email or clinic 
visit as per the physician’s direction until event r esolution or stabilization .   
 
A pre -existing condition should not be reported as an adverse event unless there has been a substantial increase in 
severity or frequency of the problem that has not been attributed to natural history. Chan ges in the severity of an 
event will be documented to allow for a determination if the event should be re -categorized from an ETE to AE.   
Safety evaluations for this study include an interview with the study subject at each follow -up visit by [CONTACT_518451]. This information will be documented in CRF without regard for cause or relation to device and/or procedure.

outcome information  until resolution or stabilization. 
8.4 REPORTING PROCEDURES  
8.4.1  ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
All Adverse Events (AEs) and Expected Treatment Effects (ETEs) observed by [CONTACT_4866], investigators, or other 
study staff from first exposure to the study product through last study follow -up visit will be recorded. If a device -
related AE, ETE, SAE, or unanticipated serious device related effect is ongoing at the final study visit, the subj ect will 
be followed until resolution, until the condition stabilizes, until the event is otherwise explained, or the subject is lost to follow -up. The investigator should make every effort to ensure that follow -up includes any supplemental 
investigations as may be indicated to elucidate, as completely as practical, the nature and/or causality of the AE or 
SAE. This may include unscheduled follow up visits for AE assessment.  
 
Study subjects will be instructed in the ICF, post -treatment take home instruction s, and verbally by [CONTACT_518453].  AE information will be collected throughout the duration of the study and 
recorded on CRFs. Subjects experiencing ongoing adverse events will be contact[CONTACT_148130] 8. 3.                                                                                                                                                
 
Any new medical problem, or an exacerbation of an existing condition, reported from the time the informed consent 
form is signed must be followed until the last study visit after the last study treatment or until event resolution.   
AEs will not be followed up after the final study visit, which is scheduled <add time period in days, weeks or months>

IRB as soon as possible, but no later than five working days after the emergency occurred.  
 
 Any permanent change to the protocol, whether it is an overall change  or a change for specific study center(s), must 
be handled as a protocol amendment. Any amendment to the protocol that appears indicated as the study progresses will be fully discussed by [CONTACT_093](s) and the Sponsor. If agreement is reached regardi ng the need 
for an amendment, the Sponsor will write it. The written amendment must be submitted to the chairman of the IRB identified with this responsibility. Except for “administrative amendments”, investigators must await IRB approval 
of protocol amend ments before implementing the change(s). Administrative amendments are defined to have no 
effect on the validity of the data or information resulting from the completion of the approved protocol, or the relationship of likely patient risk to benefit relied  upon to approve the protocol; the scientific soundness of the 
investigational plan or protocol; and the right, safety or welfare of the human subjects involved in the investigation.  
When, in judgment of the chairman of the IRB, the investigators and/or th e Sponsor, the amendment to the protocol 
substantially alters the study design and/or increases the potential risk to the subject, the currently approved written 
Informed Consent Form will require similar modification. In such cases, repeat informed consen t will be obtained 
from subjects enrolled in the study before continued participation.  
16. CONFLICT  OF INTEREST  POLICY  
The independence of this study from any actual or perceived influence is critical. Therefore, any actual conflict of interest of 
persons who have a role in the design, conduct, analysis, publication, or any aspect of this trial will be disclosed and 
managed. Furthermore, persons who have a perceived conflict of interest will be required to have such conflicts managed 
in a way that is appropriate to their participation in the trial. The study leadership has established policies and proced ures 
for all study group members to disclose all conflicts of interest and will establish a mech anism for the managemen t of all 
reported dualities of interest.

Version [ADDRESS_4547] [LOCATION_002] including 
Arkansas, are known as the “stroke belt.” There the average stroke mortality is 
≈20% to 40% higher than the rest of the nation3. Stroke is the leading cause of 
serious long -term disability3. Between 2012 and 2030, disability and medical 
costs related to str oke are projected to triple, from $71.6 billion to $184.1 
billion, with the majority of the projected increase in costs arising from those 
65 to 79 years of age4. 
 
There are two main forms of stroke, ischemic and hemorrhagic. An ischemic 
stroke occurs in 85% of cases and is caused by [CONTACT_5123], 
obstructing blood flow to a portion of the brain1. Currently, the only approved 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_5099] (tPA), 
a thrombolytic agent that clea rs the thrombus within the blood vessel, or intra -
arterial catheter thrombectomy. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_5100], it reaches 
only approximately 7% of ischemic stroke victims in the United St ates5. Delay 
beyond the effective time window for therapy is a common reason for failure. 
To reduce the devastating impact of stroke on individuals and society, we 
continue to seek ways to improve functional recovery and limit ischemic 
damage in stroke pat ients. The potential neuroprotective agent, 
dodecafluoropentane emulsion (DDFPe) has recently shown strong positive 
effects in pre -clinical animal models of acute ischemic stroke6-11. Other 
perfluorocarbons have been tested in humans as potential neuroprot ectants 
and blood substitutes12 yet none have been successful.  
 
DDFPe (2% w/vol) is a liquid perfluorocarbon nanodroplet which transports 
over [ADDRESS_4548] development can be used in support of 
therapeutic development of DDFPe. NuvOx is currently conducting a Phase 
Ib/II trial of DDFPe as a radiatio n sensitizer to reverse tumor hypoxia in 
glioblastoma18 and is about to start a study in sickle cell disease for which an 
IND has been granted. NuvOx has received Orphan Drug Designations for 
both the glioblastoma and sickle cell disease applications.  
 
This fluorocarbon with its greater innate oxygen carrying capacity and smaller 
particle size that allows delivery to occluded and ischemic areas is a superior 
oxygen transporter (OT). DDFPe was shown to significantly improve

February 22, 2018  Page 8 functional recovery within two hou rs of dosing and full recovery by 3.5 hours 
in the rabbit stroke model6. A small dose of 0.1 ml/kg was effective in the 
animal model and may provide clinical neuroprotection during pre -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5101]10. Recent DDFPe studies confirmed its str ong capability 
as a neuroprotectant, which  widened the therapeutic window to 9 hours in 
ischemic stroke rabbit models. In those studies >80% of infarct volume was 
protected to [ADDRESS_4549]  
DDFPe is an emulsion of 2% dodecafluoropentane in stabilizers (sucrose, PE -
Telomer B) and phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.0). Compared to higher 
molecular weight liquid fluorocarbons that have already been studied  
extensively as OTs, DDFPe carries far more oxygen per gram of fluorocarbon.  
 
Stoichiometrically, DDFP has 200 times the oxygen carrying capacity 
compared to human hemoglobin. Consequently, if it were administered 
intravenously (IV) and passed through the lungs of patients breathing high 
concentrations of oxygen, it would take up large amounts of oxygen and 
increase the oxygen concentration in blood in a dose -dependent way. 
Hypothetically, by [CONTACT_5124]2 
environments patient recovery from stroke will be improved.  
 
1.3 Preclinical Studies  
Extensive work was done to evaluate the toxicity and PK/PD of DDFPe as an 
ultrasound contrast -imaging  agent. During development,  most work was done 
using "activated" dodeca fluoropentane emulsion (DDFPe) referred to as 
EchoGen® when it was studied as a contrast agent. EchoGen was 
administered as bolus IV injections. Activation was achieved by [CONTACT_5125] (usually by [CONTACT_5126] a syringe) which resulted in 2 mic ron 
sized microbubbles of gas in the circulation. The “activated” form of DDFPe 
has been shown to have more toxicity than "unactivated" compound (0.2 
micron vesicles of DDFP without microbubbles). Recently, in a single - dose 
rat study, the maximum tolerate d dose of "unactivated" DDFPe was 
determined to be 6 mL/kg, which converted to a human equivalent dose 
(HED) of approximately 1 mL/kg. At that dose in the rats, toxicity was 
observed to be impaired locomotion and blanching of the typi[INVESTIGATOR_5102] e yes and gums. No mortality was observed and all animals recovered 
within [ADDRESS_4550] also been performed in non -human primates. Anaesthetized 
rhesus monkeys received 0.6 mL/kg of activated DDFPe IV every 30 minutes 
for 3 doses without adverse ef fects19. In addition, conscious cynomolgus 
monkeys showed no adverse reactions to 0.6 mL/kg of activated DDFPe given 
IV every 30 minutes for 3 doses and showed only minor transient changes in 
blood pressure and heart rate at up to 1.1 mL/kg19.

the Investigator’s Brochure.  
 
1.4 Clinical Trials  
Pharmacokinetic data collected during studies conducted by [CONTACT_5127]16,17. The pharmacokinetics of DDFP in human subjects  
exhibits biphasic decline after an IV bolus dose; there is a rapid initial decline 
followed by a slow terminal elimination phase17. The terminal elimination 
phase (t 1/2) in humans ranges from 81 -99.5 min for doses of 0.15 -0.35 mL/kg. 
The values of half-life in dogs (30 -48 min) were shorter than humans. The 
half-life is the shortest in rats (0.7 -1.9 min). Efficacy was demonstrated in 
lower levels in animal stroke models and higher levels are not thought 
necessary in humans.  
 
DDFP is not metabolized i n humans. The major route of excretion of DDFP is 
through expi[INVESTIGATOR_5103]. Almost one hundred percent of administered dose was 
recovered in the expi[INVESTIGATOR_5104]. The clearance of DDFP in humans is 
43.9-65.2 mL/min/kg.  
 
1.5 Rationale for Conducting the Trial  
A safe, reliable therapy deployed early in the care of acute stroke patients, 
either ischemic or hemorrhagic, that restored critical oxygen supply to brain 
could potentially attenuate ischemic tissue damage and could improve long -
term patient outcomes. Im mediate restoration of critical brain oxygenation to 
bridge the time to vascular reperfusion by [CONTACT_5128], improve immediate outcomes, decrease sequelae, 
and reduce long -term health care costs.  
 
DDFPe (2% w /vol dodecafluoropentane emulsion (NVX -208)) is a liquid 
fluorocarbon, which  transports over [ADDRESS_4551] MAG clinical trial of 
acute strokes20. 
 
We hypothesize that administration of DDFPe  will provide critical tissue 
oxygenation in acute stroke patients to decrease stroke volumes and symptoms 
in these patients.  
 
The rationale for administering the doses evaluated is:  
1. The dose levels are within the  levels already tested in animals and 
humans6-11,16,17. Volunteers received two IV bolus doses of 0.35 mL/kg of 
activated DDFPe 24 hours apart and brain cancer patients received daily 
doses of 0.17 mL/kg of unactivated DDFPe19.

Version 11 
February 22, 2018  Page 10 2. Therapeutic reversal of tumo r hypoxia has already been observed in 
patients administered doses of 0.1 mL/kg and 0.17 mL/kg19,21. 
 
3. Therapeutic reduction in stroke damage has been observed at dose levels 
of 0.1 mL/kg in rabbits6-11. Since drug effects tend to correlate with body 
surfac e area/weight, one would predict that a dose of approximately 0.03 
mL/kg should be effective in humans compared to rabbits. Therefore, we 
do not believe that it is necessary to explore doses higher than 0.17 mL/kg.

2.3 Exploratory Objective  
We will evaluate the feasibility of using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale 
(NIHSS) to assess the immediate response to intravenous DDFPe in patients with 
AIS. 
 
3.0 Study Design  
3.1 Study Design  
This study is a randomized, placebo controlled, blinded escalating dose study 
designed to determine the MTD and adverse events possibly related to intravenous 
administration of DDFPe . At each of three dose levels (0.05, 0.10, 0.17 mL/kg) six 
subjects will receive DDFPe and two will receive placebo.

DDFPe  (2% w/vol dodecafluoropentane emulsion (NVX -208)) is a liquid 
fluorocarbon, which  transports over 200 times as much oxygen per milligram of 
fluorocarbon as liquid fluorocarbons that were previously tested extensively as 
oxygen therapeutics. The active ingredient dodecafluoropentane (DDFP) is a liquid 
with a boiling point of 28 -30°C at atmospheric pressure. It is formulated as a 
nanodroplet dispersion of 2% (w/v) DDFP, stabilized by a 0.3% (w/v) 
fluorosurfactant, PEG Telomer B, in a continuous phase of 30% (w/v) sucrose.

Version [ADDRESS_4556] been manufactured under asep tic conditions at 
NuvOx Pharma in Tucson, Arizona, [LOCATION_003]. DDFPe  is produced as a stable emulsion, 
which is terminally filtered through 0.2 μm sterile filters, and aseptically sealed in 
vials containing 10 mL of DDFPe.  
 
The placebo will be a sterile 1:101 dil ution of Intralipid® 20% IV fat emulsion in 
aqueous sodium chloride (0.9% w/v) for injection prepared by [CONTACT_5129]. Immediately prior to injection, the 
placebo will be aseptically compounded and placed  directly into the same dispensing 
syringes as those for dispensing used for the injection of DDFPe22, 23. The placebo 
will not be stored for any length of time.  
 
5.[ADDRESS_4557]  
DDFPe will be shipped to the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) 
Research Pharmacy prior to the start of the study along with instructions for handling, 
storage, dispensing and administration of DDFPe. All instructions are detailed in the 
Pharmacy Manual.  
 
Receipt of dr ug in proper condition will be recorded by [CONTACT_5130]. 
Upon receipt, any drug that does not meet the conditions established in the Pharmacy 
Manual or arrives with vials that are broken or otherwise damaged will be reported to 
NuvOx and instruc tion will be sought as to whether the vials can be used or should be 
set aside for later return or destruction. The site will be will be responsible for its own 
drug accountability.  
 
DDFPe will be provided in [ADDRESS_4558] a table used to calculate the dose, drug dosing and 
accountability forms and will be labeled for investigational use only. Immediately 
prior to injection, DDFPe or placebo will be prepared as per instructions in the 
Pharmacy Manual by [CONTACT_5131]. The syringes containing either DDFPe or 
placebo will be appro priately labeled for investigational use only and provided to the 
clinical team in a blinded manner.  
 
Once a kit has been opened, it should be returned to the pharmacy after use.

* Subjects weighing more than 100kg will be included in the study. Doses will be limited 
to a maximum based on a weight of 100 kg for subjects weighing in excess of 100 kg.  
 
5.3.2  Dose Limiting Toxicity  
Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) will be defined by [CONTACT_5133]:  
• Clinically significant changes in vital signs:  
o Heart rate ± 50% from baseline  
o Respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] >30 /min  
o Systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg or >220 mmHg  
o Diastolic blood pressure >110 mmHg  
• New (i.e. not seen at baseline) ECG changes consistent with:  
o Acute right ventricular dilation or strain  
o Incomplete or complete bundle branch block  
o Q waves in leads III and aVF  
o T-wave inversion and/or ST segment changes in the precordial leads  
o Any other clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia  
• Common Terminology Crit eria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) [ADDRESS_4559] wall 
pain or hypoxia (See Appendix 1  for specific criteria)  
• NIHSS: sudden worsening of 4 or more from the baseline (pre -DDFPe 
initiation)  
• The Medical Monitor will review all data collected at Post -Dose #3 
(approximately 4 -6 hours after the end of the Dose #[ADDRESS_4560]). Enrollment will be on hold until the 
Medical Monitor has reviewed the data and approves enrollment of an 
additional subject. The Medical Monitor may choose to temporarily halt 
the study if serious concerns arise regarding subject safety.  
 
5.3.3  Maximum Tolerated Dose  
 The algorithm for determining the MTD is as follows : 
• Up to six subjects and two controls will be enrolled at each dose level 
constituting each cohort. Subjects will be evaluated for four hours after 
receiving the last of the three doses and again at discharge from the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5105], whichever is soone r. 
• DLT is previously defined in Section 5.3.2 . 
• If no DLTs are observed in a patient at Post -Dose #3 of DDFPe or 
placebo the Medical Monitor may allow progression to the next patient.

February 22, 2018  Page 14 • After all [ADDRESS_4561] been enrolled in a cohort, the Medical Monitor 
will review the data. A decision as to whether the study may proceed to 
the next cohort will be made.  
• If a total of two or fewer subjects in an [ADDRESS_4562] to determine if the 
observed DLTs occurred in subjects who received DDFPe or placebo. If 
any of the DLTs were observed in the subjects receiving placebo, the  
Medical Monitor may allow the study to proceed as long as two or fewer 
subjects with DLTs received DDFPe.  
• If three or more subjects who received DDFPe in an [ADDRESS_4563] been exceeded 
and further en rollment in the cohort as well as dose escalation will stop. 
The dose administered to the previous cohort will be considered to be 
the MTD.  
• Subjects who withdraw from the study for reasons other than a DLT 
may be replaced.  
• The Medical Monitor will review a ll safety data for each patient and 
cohort and must grant approval before proceeding to the next patient 
and/or cohort.  
• Exploration of lower dose levels intermediate to a level previously 
shown to be well tolerated may be considered. In addition to reducin g 
the dose, this might include reducing the number of doses, increasing the 
time between doses, and/or altering the infusion time.  
• The dose exploration will be complete when either: (1) the MTD has 
been defined or (2) when no MTD has been reached but six s ubjects and 
two controls have been treated at the last cohort level approved by [CONTACT_5134].  
 
5.[ADDRESS_4564]  
For each cohort, the dose of DDFPe or placebo will be calculated based on body 
weight according to the table in Appendix 2 . Before administration, the drug will be 
prepared for injection per instructions in the Pharmacy Manual. DDFPe will be 
administered intravenously over 5 -10 minutes through an IV catheter placed in a 
peripheral vein or through a central venous catheter (Note: a central venous catheter 
will not be p laced solely for the study). The site of the intravenous catheter through 
which the study drug is administered will be recorded in the research record. Doses 
will be administered by [CONTACT_5135]. After the first dose, subsequent doses will be 
administered 90 ± 10 minutes after the end of the previous infusion. Administration 
of all doses should occur with the syringe in the vertical position assuring that any

(NOTE: THIS I S THE MOST CRITICAL SAFETY CONSIDERATION DURING 
INFUSION). The placebo will be placed in identical syringes and administered in the 
same way. The volume of drug product to be used from each syringe will be provided 
on the label from pharmacy. The start and  stop times for each infusion will be 
recorded on the source documents. The volume of the infusion will also be recorded.

the following reasons:  
• Serious Adverse Event (SAE) believed to be related to investigational product  
• Intolerable side effects  
• Failure to complete required study procedures  
• Clinically significant laboratory or ECG abnormalities  
• Significant change in oxygenation as measured by [CONTACT_5137]  
• Initiation of treatment with a prohibited drug during the intervention phase  
• Non-compliance with the treatment regimen  
Subjects may also be withdrawn for any reason if the investigator believes that it is in 
the best interest of the subject to discontinue the study.  
6.5 Replacement of Subjects  
Subjects who withdraw or are withdrawn from the study prior to the completion of 
the Day 7 visit may be replaced at the discretion of the investigator.  
 
7.0 Investigational Plan   
7.1 Usual Care Provided by [CONTACT_5138] (routine) care for patients suffering a stroke will be offered as would be 
the case had the patient not enrolled in the trial. This may include  physiological 
monitoring, medical procedures, drug therapy (including t PA), respi[INVESTIGATOR_1413], 
and ancillary or accessory care. Routine care will be directed by [CONTACT_102]’s treating 
physician. If the treating physician believes that it is no longer in the best interest for 
the patient to continue in the study, he/she will  contact [CONTACT_5139] -related procedures.  
 
7.2 Consent Process  
Potential study subjects whose condition has rendered them unable to provide 
informed consent due to aphasia, confusion, impaired consciousness or other 
cogni tive impairments such as intellectual disability and dementia will require a 
legally authorized representative (LAR).  
 
Trained study personnel will review the IRB -approved study summary brochure with 
the subject/LAR and answer questions followed by [CONTACT_5140]/or a LAR. The subject/LAR will be allowed to ask 
questions. If the subject/LAR agrees to participate, the consent will be signed and a 
copy will be provided to the subject. Once the consent process is c omplete, study

determined stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_5106] (i.e. after each subject in each cohort and 
at the end of each cohort prior to proceeding to the next highest dose).  
 
7.3 Verification of Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria  
After the consent process is complete, trained study personnel will review the 
Inclusi on and Exclusion criteria with the subject/LAR. The following options are then 
possible:  
• If the subject meets all criteria, they will be allowed to proceed with the study.  
• If the subject fails to meet criteria, no further study -related procedures will be 
conducted.  
• If the failure to meet criteria is minor, the investigator may choose to approach 
the Medical Monitor for a waiver. A waiver will be granted only if doing so will 
not place the subject at increased risk if allowed to participate in the study.  
 
Study personnel will document the review of Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria on the 
appropriate form and place the signed form in the study file. The investigator will be 
notified of the results of the review.

• Complete Blood Count  
• Electrolytes (Na, K, Cl,)  
• BUN  
• Creatinine  
• LFTs (AST, ALT, Total Bilirubin, Direct Bilirubin, Albumin)  
• Calcium  
• Glucose  
 
It is anticipated that many of these tests will be done as part of the subjects’ 
routine care. These tests will provi de baseline values prior to administration of 
DDFPe for later comparison with post -dosing test results. The results of these 
tests may or may not be available prior to dosing with DDFPe. None of the 
tests would exclude a subject from participating in the s tudy.  
 
7.6 Day 1: Study Procedures  
After documentation that the subject passed the screening procedures and meets all 
Inclusion and Exclusion criteria, study personnel will check to assure that a patent 
intravenous catheter is in place for infusion of the DDFPe. The catheter should be 
used solely for infusion of DDFPe and compatible intravenous fluids during the study 
intervention period (from the initiation of Dose #1 to after the Dose #3 infusion is 
complete).  
 
Dose #1:  DDFPe will be ordered from the phar macy and prepared as previously 
described. The time that the infusion begins will be recorded. The drug or placebo 
will be infused over [ADDRESS_4582] will be observed for any signs of adverse 
events for 90 minutes after the completion of the infusion.  
 
Dose # 2:  Any new concomitant medications will be recorded. The second dose of 
DDFPe or placebo will be administered as previously described over [ADDRESS_4583] will be observed for any signs of adverse events for 90 minutes 
after the completion of the infusion.  
 
Dose #3:  Any new concomitant medications will be recorded. The third d ose of 
DDFPe or placebo will be administered as previously described over 5 -10 minutes. 
Times will be recorded at the beginning and end of the infusion as before. Vital signs 
and pulse oximetry will be monitored. Measurements will be recorded every 15 
minu tes. The NIHSS will be repeated within 60 minutes after the end of the DDFPe

Vitals should be taken at all scheduled time points (i .e. every 15 minutes); however, 
deviations from scheduled times will not be considered protocol deviations. The exact 
date and time of each measurement will be recorded on the CRF.  
 
Post-Dose #3: Approximately 4±1 hours after the end of Dose #3, the following 
observations will be made:  
• Concomitant medications administered after Dose #3  
• A brief physical examination  
• Vital signs (BP, HR, RR)  
• Pulse oximeter measurement  
• NIHSS  
• ECG  
• Laboratory testing  
 
Any AEs observed during the intervention period will be r ecorded, assessed, and 
followed to resolution.  
 
7.7 Day 4: Study Procedures  
All subjects will be contact[CONTACT_5141]. If the subject is still hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], any 
significant change in condition will be recorded as a possible AE and assessed by [CONTACT_5142]. All AEs will be graded (mild, moderate, severe), assessed for relatedness 
(not related, possibly related, probably related, definitely related), and followed to 
resolution as described in Section 8.[ADDRESS_4585] has been dischar ged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5107] 4,

8.0 Adverse Events  
8.1 Definitions  
Adverse Event  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence that develops or worsens 
in severity during the course of the study, whether or not it has a causal relationship 
to the study treatment. Concurrent illnesses or injuries should be regarded as AEs. 
Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are considered AEs if the abnormality:  
• results in study withdrawal  
• is associated with a serious adverse event  
• is associated with clinical signs  or symptoms  
• leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
• is considered by [CONTACT_5145]: A phase 1b dose -finding study of DDFPe in acute ischemic stroke  
PIs: William C. Culp, MD & Sanjeeva Onteddu, MD  
Institution: UAMS  
Sponsor: UAMS  
Version 11 
February 22, 2018  Page 23 Serious Adverse Event  
Adverse events are classified as serious or non -serious. A serious adverse event 
(SAE)  is any A E that is:  
• fatal 
• life-threatening  
• requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]  
• results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• an important medical event  
 
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, but 
are clearly of major clinical significance. They may jeopardize the subject, and may 
require intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes noted above. For 
example, drug overdose or abuse, a seizure that did no t result in in -patient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5108].  
 
All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded 
as non-serious adverse e vents . 
 
Adverse Event Reporting Period  
The study period during which adverse events must be reported is normally defined 
as the period from the initiation of any study procedures to the end of the study 
treatment follow -up. For this study, the study treatm ent follow -up is defined as within 
[ADDRESS_4587] administration of study treatment.  
 
Preexisting Condition  
A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study. A preexisting 
condition should be recorded as an adverse event  if the frequency, intensity, or the 
character of the condition worsens during the study period (e.g. if behavior worsens).  
 
General Physical Examination Findings  
At screening, any clinically significant abnormality should be recorded as a 
preexisting cond ition. At the end of the study, any new clinically significant 
findings/abnormalities that meet the definition of an adverse event must also be 
recorded and documented as an AE.  
 
Post-study Adverse Event  
All unresolved AEs should be followed by [CONTACT_5146], until the events are otherwise stable or the subject is lost to follow -up. At 
the last scheduled visit, the investigator should instruct each subject to report any 
subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the subject’s personal physician, believes 
might reasonably be related to participation in this study.

Version 11 
February 22, 2018  Page 24 Abnormal Laboratory Values  
A clinical laboratory abnormality should be documented as an AE if  any one of the 
following  conditions is met:  
• The laboratory abnormality is not otherwise refuted by a repeat test to confirm 
the abnormality  
• The abnormality suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity  
• The abnormality is of a degree that requires active management; e.g. change of 
dose, discontinuation of the investigat ional product, more frequent follow -up 
assessments, further diagnostic investigation, etc.  
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], Prolonged Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5109] a SAE  unless specifically instructed otherwise in this 
protocol. Any condition responsible for surgery should be documented as an AE if the 
condition meets the criteria for an AE.  Neither the condition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], nor surgery ar e reported as an AE in the following 
circumstances:  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5110] a preexisting condition. Surgery should not be reported as an 
outcome of an AE if the purpose of the surgery  was elective or diagnostic and 
the outcome was uneventful.  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5111].  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5112], unle ss it is a worsening or increase in frequency of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5113].  
 
8.[ADDRESS_4588] seek information on adverse 
events by [CONTACT_5147], as appropriate, by [CONTACT_5148]. Information on all 
AEs should be recorded immediately in the source document, and also in the 
appropriate adverse event module of the case report form (CRF). All clearly related 
signs, symptoms, and abnormal  diagnostic procedures results should be recorded in 
the source document and grouped under one diagnosis when possible.  
 
All AEs occurring during the study period must be recorded. The clinical course of 
each event should be followed until resolution, stab ilization, or until it has been 
determined that the study treatment or participation is not the cause. Serious adverse 
events that are still ongoing at the end of the study period must be followed up to 
determine the final outcome.  
 
8.3 Reporting Procedure s for Adverse and Serious Adverse Events  
All adverse and SAEs will be reported in accordance with FDA and local IRB 
requirements. In addition, any SAE will be reported to NuvOx and the Sponsor by [CONTACT_5149] 24 hours after becoming apparent.

8.[ADDRESS_4589] will not be appointed.  
 
8.5 Medical Monitor  
A Medical Monitor (MM) will be s elected. The MM will be a licensed physician who 
is familiar with cardiovascular disease and stroke. The MM will review the data 
collected after each patient and after each dose level and will provide an opi[INVESTIGATOR_5116] 5.3.[ADDRESS_4590] been reported appropriately.  
 
8.6 Risks and Benefits  
Risks may include pain from IV placement, hypotension,  reversible inflammatory 
changes in the lungs, nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, dizziness, fever, headache, 
reduced or elevated blood pressure, blanching of the gums, and allergy to soy or eggs. 
There may be unanticipated adverse events or outcomes. It is ant icipated that oxygen 
delivery to ischemic areas of the brain may improve thereby [CONTACT_5150]. 
It is unclear as to whether this might result in reduced cerebral tissue loss or any 
improvement in outcome following stroke. There may be no benefit to subjects.  
 
8.7 Risk Mitigation  
All subjects will be observed in a unit accustomed to treating patients with stroke. 
Customary clinical care will be provided by [CONTACT_102]’s treating physician. No 
standard treatments will be withheld as a result of part icipation in the study.  
 
Adverse events will be actively sought through the study at multiple time points. All 
AEs will be recorded and evaluated for severity and relatedness and followed to 
resolution. A MM will be appointed to review safety issues as described in Section 
8.5. Repeated measurement of clinical, ECG, and laboratory data have been included 
to detect important safety signals. Careful assessment of all AEs, especially those that 
are probably or definitely related to the investigational product, will be conducted.  
 
9.0 Data Collection  
9.1 Data Collection and Storage  
All source data will be recorded on Case Report Forms (CRFs) as described in 
Sections 9.4 and 9.5. CRFs will be placed in the subjects’ study file and stored in a 
Title: A phase 1b dose -finding study of DDFPe in acute ischemic stroke  
PIs: William C. Culp, MD & Sanjeeva Onteddu, MD

Sponsor: UAMS  
Version [ADDRESS_4591] 
(HIPAA). Those regulations require a signed subject authorization informing the 
subject of the following:  
• The personal health information (PHI) to be collected from subjects in this 
study  
• Who will have access to that information and why  
• Who will use or disclose that information  
• To whom the data may be disclosed and the reasons for this disclosure  
• The rights of a research subject to revoke their autho rization for use of their PHI  
 
In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the 
investigator, by [CONTACT_5151], retains the ability to use all information collected prior to 
the revocation of subject authorization. For subjects tha t have revoked authorization 
to collect or use PHI, attempts should be made to obtain permission to collect at least 
vital status (i.e. that the subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled study period.  
 
9.3 Study Monitoring and Data Queries  
The investigator is required to permit the Sponsor to monitor the study data, including 
all communications with the IRB, the manufacturer, all source documents, CRFs, 
pharmacy records, and any other pertinent information. Monitoring visits will be 
scheduled at  a time that is convenient for both the monitor and the investigator. The 
monitor will provide a written report to the investigator within one month after the 
conclusion of the monitoring visit.  
 
9.4 Source Documents  
Source data is all information, origina l records of clinical findings, observations, or 
other activities in a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the 
trial. Source data are contained in source documents. Examples of these original 
documents, and data records includ e: hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical and office charts, 
laboratory notes, memoranda, subjects’ diaries or evaluation checklists, pharmacy 
dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_5117], photographic 
negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, x -rays, subject files, and records kept at the 
pharmacy, at the laboratories, and at medico -technical departments involved in the 
clinical trial.

9.6 Study Auditing  
The investigator w ill permit study -related monitoring, audits, and inspections by [CONTACT_5040], the study Sponsor, government regulatory bodies, and UAMS compliance 
groups of all study related documents (e.g. source documents, regulatory documents, 
pharmacy documents, data colle ction instruments, study data etc.). The investigator 
will ensure the capability for inspections of applicable study -related facilities (e.g. 
pharmacy, diagnostic laboratory, etc.).  
 
Participation as an investigator in this study implies acceptance of pote ntial 
inspection by [CONTACT_5152]. 
FDA may choose to inspect the study records as indicated in [ADDRESS_4593] Retention  
It is the investigator’s responsibility to retain study essential documents for 2 years 
following the date a marketing application is approved for the drug for the indication 
for which it is being investigated (21 CFR 312.62). These documents should be 
retained for a longer period if required by [CONTACT_5153]. In such an instance, it is the responsibility of the 
funding entity or supplier of the investigational product to inform the 
investigator/institution as to when these documents no longer n eed to be retained.  
 
10.0 Data Analysis Plan  
10.1 Sample Size  
This is a Phase I study. No sample size estimates were done.  
 
10.2 Clinical Data  
Demographic data will be presented as the mean ± SD (range) for normally 
distributed data (median ± interquartile range for non -normal data).  
 
Clinical data includes  vital signs and pulse oximetry (pre - and post -intervention). Pre - 
and post -intervention data will be grouped and examined for differences using a two -
sided t -test or ANOVA, as appropriate. P re- and post - laboratory data will be 
compared in a similar manner. ECGs will be read by a board -certified cardiologist 
and clinically significant changes will be described.

Fewer than 20% are likely to get IV tPA or IA reperfusion therapy of the total 24

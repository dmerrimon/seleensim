 3  PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
3.1 Purpose:  
This protocol seeks to analyze patient outcomes of the standard of care, monitored group 
exercise regimen of high-load resistance training and functional exercises with compound 
movements under close supervision on women who have been treated for breast cancer.  
 
Primary Objective 
[ADDRESS_48205]- exercise 
assessment and 1 year after exercise assessment, including body mass, fat mass, 
fat-free mass, % fat, and % fat-free mass.  
 
      Hypotheses  
In this study, we hypothesize that an observed exercise regimen utilizing high-load 
resistance training initiated during or after cancer treatment is safe and feasible in 
women and may improve functional mobility, body composition, and resting metabolic 
rate.   
 
3.2 Background and Significance:  
 
Obesity is a risk factor for both breast cancer and disease recurrence after 
treatment.[ADDRESS_48206] to both quantify and increase activity levels during 
treatment and survivorship.5 Furthermore, and based on these findings, several areas of 
Update 3_12/14/[ADDRESS_48207] 
cancer treatment, including elevated serum glucose, decreased insulin sensitivity, 
elevated serum insulin, increased inflammatory factors, and decreased muscle mass.6–8 
These factors can be generally improved through specific targeted exercise training, 
suggesting metabolic benefits of exercise beyond simple weight loss. Furthermore, as 
resistance training improves strength, muscle hypertrophy, and body composition, and 
leads to physical and cellular changes that appear to counter these metabolic 
perturbations – often unrelated to changes in overall weight – such training may be a 
prudent strategy to improve measurable variables associated with breast cancer specific 
and overall health benefit.9–[ADDRESS_48208] cancer treatment.17,19–[ADDRESS_48209] cancer patients also utilize light-weight free-weights or open 
kinetic chain (OKC) movements where the body is fixed and the distal extremities are 
mobile (as in arm curls), both of which can often limit activation of core and accessory 
muscles, leading to a less intense regimen that may limit functional and mobility benefits 
and hypertrophy.22,23 Closed kinetic chain (CKC) exercises involve fixation of the distal 
aspect of the extremity (as in the squat), as opposed to proximal isolation (with OKC), 
therefore requiring involvement of multiple joints and co-contraction of multiple 
Update 3_12/14/2023  Page 8 of 29 
CONFIDENTIAL 
 
 simultaneous muscles to stabilize the body during movement, also known as compound 
exercises. Such CKC exercises include lunges, squats, deadlifts, and power cleans; on 
the contrary, examples of OKC exercises are bench press, seated leg curls and 
extensions, and machine curls. CKC and compound exercises also mimic athletic 
movements, thus positively impacting mobility and function.  
Studies in non-cancer patients reveal that resistance training routines that expose 
muscle tissue to extensive mechanical tension with subsequent muscle damage and 
metabolic stress promote training-induced muscle growth.[ADDRESS_48210] been consistently shown to improve several 
factors associated with health, including: 1) Improved strength and fitness and decreased 
risk of injury, 2) Increased muscle mass and corresponding decrease in inflammation,25 
3) Enhanced insulin sensitivity, elevated resting metabolic rate, and decreased risk of 
diabetes,4 4) Improved mobility and overall health,26 and 5) Increased bone mineral 
density.27 Furthermore, resting metabolic rate, which comprises the majority of daily total 
energy expenditure, is proportional to muscle mass.28 Additionally, excess postexercise 
oxygen consumption (EPOC), or the continued enhanced metabolic effect after the 
completion of exercise, is enhanced via strenuous resistance training compared with 
aerobic training alone.[ADDRESS_48211] 
been largely disproved by [CONTACT_45575].31 Adverse effects (AEs) reported 
in prior exercise studies include typi[INVESTIGATOR_45559]-limiting musculoskeletal issues, including 
muscle strains, joint and back pain, shin splints, and tendinitis.32 Overall, AEs are minimal. 
Furthermore, an observed environment with supervision by [CONTACT_45576],33,34 as can adaption of a workout regimen that 
accounts for individuals’ functional movement abilities, mobility, and function.35  
 
3.3 Rationale : 
To date, the majority of exercise intervention studies for women with breast cancer 
after treatment focus on aerobic exercise regimens and/or low to moderate-intensity 
resistance training. Additionally, the components of resistance training often rely on 
isolated and open kinetic chain exercises utilizing light weights and high repetition 
schemes that may not be optimal for hypertrophy and improvement of functional 
movements.[ADDRESS_48212] generally been implemented with two major goals: 
1) Provide weight reduction, 2) Increase energy expenditure measured via metabolic 
equivalent of task (MET). Such goals are based on significant literature revealing 
improved outcomes after breast cancer treatment in physically active women and worse 
outcomes in women who gain weight during and after treatment.2 However, 
Update 3_12/14/[ADDRESS_48213] cancer 
utilizing guidelines from the National Strength and Conditioning Association (NSCA). 
 
3.4   Design and Procedure:  
Feasibility and safety single-arm registry study in subjects with newly diagnosed ductal 
carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or invasive carcinoma of the breast. 
3.5   Selection of Subjects and Sample Size:  
Women ages 20-89 treated for ductal carcinoma in situ or invasive carcinoma will be 
considered for this trial.  
The accrual goal is 43 subjects to achieve a sample size of 40 subjects, allowing for 
enrolled subjects who are unable to be complete the exercise program.   Estimated 
accrual and completion time is approximately 2 years.  
3.6   Duration of Study:  
Subjects will be on study for an approximate [ADDRESS_48214] and/or 
radiation oncologist per standard of care (SOC) for follow up care but utilizing the data for 
research purposes.

4.3 Inclusion of Women and Minorities 
Women of all races/ethnicities will be eligible for this study and accrual is expected to 
reflect the population of subjects seen within the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109], PA area.  
5.  EXERCISE REGIMEN  
5.1 Location:  
The exercise facility participating in the study is located within AGH Suburban at the AHN 
Cancer Institute Exercise Oncology and Resiliency Center, [ADDRESS_48220] 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109], PA [ZIP_CODE].  
5.2 Personnel: 
As per SOC, the exercise regimens will be constructed and reviewed by [CONTACT_45578], MD, CSCS, and associated 
Certified Strength and Conditioning Specialists and staff. Champ is a radiation oncologist 
trained in integrative medicine and is a Certified Strength and Conditioning Specialist. 
Resistance training classes will be directly observed by [CONTACT_45579], and 
Update 3_12/14/2023  Page 11 of 29 
CONFIDENTIAL 
 
 regimens will be continually adjusted for both exercise progression and safety as per SOC 
at the facility. 
5.3 Exercise Regimen: 
The exercise regimen will utilize a mixture of compound movements utilizing both open 
and closed kinetic chain movements (CKC), focusing on exercises with the goal of 
improving body composition, strength, mobility, muscle mass, and several associated 
variables. CKC exercises are generally more intense as they require multi-joint movement 
patterns. Examples include lunges, squats, and deadlifts. Classes will be run by [CONTACT_45580], as per SOC. It will follow a 
linear progression technique and guidelines from the National Strength and Conditioning 
Association (NSCA) will be followed. The observed classes will take place three times per 
week. Warm-up exercises focused on mobility, flexibility and core activation will be 
performed to increase mobility and reduce the risk of injury. Each individual exercise 
workout will generally progress from most intense, CKC, compound, and athletic 
movements to least intense throughout the workout to maximize safety. Additionally, each 
workout will provide full body resistance training to focus on functional exercises, intensity, 
and efficiency. Each workout will take approximately 45-[ADDRESS_48221] 3 
months. The SOC follow up assessment will occur 1 year after exercise. Data from the 
SOC exercise and assessments will be used for research.  
Exercise class attendance will be recorded. Workout regimens, including exercise type, 
sets, and repetitions will be recorded to aid in workout consistency and progression and 
to calculate load lifted. Initial strength assessment will occur during the initial two weeks 
of the workout regimen to help ascertain proper weight usage. Repetition schemes to 
mimic basic exercise principles for hypertrophy, strength, and power based on 1-repetition 
maximum (1RM) extrapolation and repetition range charts after assessing each exercise 
performed to near repetition fatigue/voluntary failure (i.e. when a repetition or safe lifting 
form can no longer be maintained while monitored by [CONTACT_45581]). 
Weight lifted, repetitions, sets, and notes will be recorded and utilized to estimate intensity 
via volume load calculations (volume load = weight lifted × repetitions × sets). An example 
of a workout is listed below.  
 
Day One (anterior muscle closed-chain compound exercise focus): 
A1: Split Squat 4X6 week 1-4, 4X4 weeks 5-8, 4X2 week 9-12

 b. Baseline Metabolic, Body Composition, Strength, and Mobility Testing 
Prior to initiation of the exercise regimen, each participant will undergo body 
composition analysis via an InBody 970.  InBody testing is noninvasive and 
requires no ionizing radiation. The individual simply stands on the machine while 
holding handles. An ultrasound will also be used to measure muscle and adipose 
tissue thickness to provide additional metrics for body composition. This will be 
performed via a traditional ultrasound and software (BodyMetrix) will calculate 
Update 3_12/14/2023  Page 14 of 29

 muscle mass, fat mass, and body composition metrics. More information is 
supplied in Appendix VI. Both also supply resting metablic rate calculations. 
Functional movement assessments will be performed at this visit as well, and takes 
approximately 10 minutes.  
Resting metabolic rate may also be assessed per SOC at this session via a 
VO2 Master device (VO2 Master Health Sensors Inc., British Columbia, 
Canada),where the individual will breathe into the device for several minutes at a 
time. The total test takes less than [ADDRESS_48223] is noninvasive and 
measures respi[INVESTIGATOR_45561]. Alternatively, the InBody machine and ultrasound can be utilized to 
measure metabolic rate as well. Additional testing with this device is at the 
discretion of the staff as per SOC. Grip strength will be assessed via a Jamar Hand 
Dynamometer Grip Strength Measurement Meter bilaterally at the neutral position 
and with the arm of the head.  
These tests are part of the SOC exercise regimen and workup and no 
additional costs will be associated with these procedures.  
 
6.3 Exercise Period:  
The exercise program will last three months. The initial exercise schema was developed 
by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_45562]. Throughout the exercise program, participants will 
continuously be assessed via load lifted calculations and observations of exercise 
mechanics, both of which will impact increases in load and exercise difficulty during the 
program, as per SOC.  
6.4 Follow-up Period:  
There will be no follow-up once an individual completes the study.  
6.[ADDRESS_48224](s):  
If at any time the constraints of this protocol are detrimental to the patient’s health and/or 
the patient no longer wishes to continue in the study, the patient will be removed from the 
protocol follow-up. In this event the reason(s) for discontinuation of study participation will 
be noted by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_45563]. Data acquired up until that point will be retained for 
analyses. 
There will be a SOC follow up assessment [ADDRESS_48225] from the study at any time based on certain criteria. Reasons for 
PI-initiated discontinuation include: 
- Pregnancy 
- Inability to continue the exercise program 
Update 3_12/14/[ADDRESS_48226] data from participants 
at appropriate time points even after discontinuation of the exercise program. 
6.5.3 Replacement of Early Withdrawal(s) 
Subjects who prematurely withdraw will not be replaced unless withdrawal occurs prior to 
initiation of the exercise regimen . 
7.   STATISTICAL METHODS AND DATA ANALYSIS 
7.1. Analysis of Safety 
Safety will be continually assessed during each workout regimen by [CONTACT_45582], and adjustments will be made to exercise performance during the workout 
to increase safety as per standard of care. 
 
The AEs will be reviewed and assessed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_45564]. Accidental disclosure of confidentiality is the only adverse event that would 
occur.  
 
7.[ADDRESS_48227] 75% of the planned exercise sessions. 
Dropout rate, defined as individuals who quit the workout regimen altogether, is 20%. It 
is assumed that the rate of attendance will be similar in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. The 90% lower 
confidence bound (LCB) for the proportion of patients completing at least 75% of exercise 
sessions will be constructed. A 90% LCB ≥ .56 will be considered a success (that is, the 
proportion of patients successfully completing the exercise regimen is at least 0.56 with 
90% confidence). With 40 patients studied, a 90% LCB of 0.56 is associated with a 
completion rate of 0.7. Data from all participants will be analyzed for anthropometric, 
metabolic, fitness and QOL regardless of attendance level but a subgroup analysis will 
be performed using data from participants with ≥75% attendance.

APPENDIX III: Strength Assessment 
Strength assessment will be performed and recorded for each exercise during the initial two 
weeks of the exercise program, known as the “run-in” period, as is SOC. These numbers will be 
recorded for each participant. Loads will be calculated at three weeks and then recalculated every [ADDRESS_48247] health you can imagine. 
4 Mark an X on the scale to indicate how your health is TODAY. 
5 Now, please write the number you marked on the scale in the box 
below.

APPENDIX V: Functional Movement Screen and Y-Balance Test 
The Functional Mobility Screen is a tool used prior to the initiation of an exercise protocol to 
assess individual mobility and movement patterns. These patterns are general accompanied by 
[CONTACT_45586], but can be improved 
through specific exercises which can reduce the risk of chronic injury.  a)  STRENUOUS EXERCISE  
(HEART BEATS RAPI[INVESTIGATOR_45574])  
(e.g., running, jogging, hockey, football, soccer, squash,  
basketball, cross country skiing, judo, roller skating,  
vigorous swimming, vigorous long distance bicycling)    
 
 
 
X9  
b) MODERATE EXERCISE  
(NOT EXHAUSTING)  
(e.g., fast walking, baseball, tennis, easy bicycling,  
volleyball, badminton, easy swimming, alpi[INVESTIGATOR_3714],  
popular and folk dancing)    
 
 
 
X5  
 
c)  MILD/LIGHT EXERCISE  
(MINIMAL EFFORT)  
(e.g., yoga, archery, fishing from river bank, bowling,  
horseshoes, golf, snow-mobiling, easy walking)    
 
 
X3  
WEEKLY LEISURE-TIME ACTIVITY SCORE     
 
EXAMPLE  
Strenuous = 3 times/wk  
Moderate = 6 times/wk  
Light = 14 times/wk 
Total leisure activity score = (9 × 3) + (5 × 6) + (3 × 14) = 27 + 30 + 42 = 99  
 
Godin Scale Score  Interpretation  
24 units or more  Active 
14 – 23 units  Moderately Active  
Less than 14 units  Insufficiently  Active/Sedentary

activity questionnaire. Health & Fitness Journal of Canada, 4(1), 18-22.

to predict injury.  
 
APPENDIX VI: Body Composition Testing 
All participants will undergo body composition testing via the InBody [ADDRESS_48249] and will be fasted overnight. During the exam, they merely stand quietly on the machine 
The InBody 970 is a bioimpedance analysis device, which utilizes electric currents to calculate a 
phase angle and resulting body composition metrics. Users stand barefoot on a device that is 
similar to a traditional scale, and they hold one handle for each hand, with the feet and hands 
touching metal electrodes. The device sends a low-dose electrical current and measures the 
change in phase angle. There is no risk to the user. 
An ultrasound will also be used to measure muscle and adipose tissue thickness to provide 
additional metrics for body composition. This will be performed via a traditional ultrasound and 
software (BodyMetrix) will calculate muscle mass, fat mass, and body composition metrics.

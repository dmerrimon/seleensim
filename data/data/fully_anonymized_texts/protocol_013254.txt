  FUNDING ORGANIZATION  Gift Funded from the JS Foundation  
NUMBER OF SITES  1 
  RATIONALE  Children with autism spectrum  disorder (ASD) have been found to 
have impaired transport of folate across the blood -brain barrier due to 
folate receptor auto -antibodies (FRAA) that either block or bind to the 
folate receptor alpha (FR alpha). This creates the condition known as “cerebral folate deficiency” where serum folate concentrations are normal but CSF folat e concentrations are low.  Recent studies have 
found that supplementing children with ASD with a reduced form of folate – folinic acid – allows for  by[CONTACT_528648], leading  to improved behavior and 
language development. We propose to further examine this exciting new therapeutic possibility by [CONTACT_70974] -label study of 
folinic acid in children with ASD to examine both changes in behavior and correlations with urinary metabolites. 
We previously created an outco mes database within a school for 
children with ASD (Oak Hill School, San Anselmo, CA) to carefully 
track teacher and parent -rated ass essments of children  enrolled in the 
school. In a prior study, we established the ability to provide a 
treatment (the phyto chemical, sulforaphane) to children in the school 
while monitoring changers in urinary metabolites and clinical outcomes. This study found that changes in specific urinary metabolites were associated with clinical improvements, which suggested specific met abolic pathways that are involved in the 
treatment response.  In the current study, we will use the same 
successful model to determine if changes in  urinary metabolites are 
correlated with clinical changes. This study may provide insight into the mechanism  of action of folinic acid  and may allow for the 
development of a biomarker prediction model that will determine which children are most likely to benefit from this treatment.  
  STUDY DESIGN Open label treatment study elucidating mechanism of action.  
  PRIMARY OBJECTIVE  To examine changes in urinary metabolites in children with ASD being treated with  folinic acid and to determine if changes in urinary 
metabolites are correlated with clinical improvements .  
 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES  Develop a prediction model to determine which children are most likely to benefit from folinic acid .

 SAFETY 
EVALUATIONS  All study subjects are enrolled at the Oak Hill School and will be observed all school days by [CONTACT_144823], who are aware of student participation in the study. Parents, teachers, and enrolled students will be advised to re port any new medical problems to study investigators, 
who will evaluate all potential adverse events and report to the CHR 
according to established guidelines.  
PLANNED INTERIM 
ANALYSES  No interim analyses planned given the short -term duration of the 
study , the established safety of the treatment , and the lack of 
randomization (so no ability to compare rates of AE’s between active and placebo treatment).  
  STATISTICS  
Primary Analysis Plan  Correlations between changes in mean levels of urinary metabolites and changes in mean behavioral measures (0 to 3 months) will be done using a spearman rank correlations test using STATA. We prospectively define correlations with an absolute value of >  0.[ADDRESS_686250] changes.  
Rationale for Number of Subjects  We are recruiting all children currently enrolled at Oak Hill  School 
(current enrollment = 36). We anticipate that we wil l enroll 20 
students in the current s tudy, but we will allow up to 40 (if school 
enrollment increases) .

 1 BACKGROUND  
 
1.1 Overview of Clinical Studies  
Cerebral folate deficiency in A SD: Prior studies have linked abnormalities in the 
metabolism of folate, an es sential B  vitamin, to ASD .[ADDRESS_686251] impaired tra nsport of folate across the blood- brain 
barrier due to auto -antibodies that either block or bind to the folate receptor alpha (FR 
alpha) . (The antibodies are known as folate receptor auto- antibodies -  (FRAA)) . This 
creates the condition known as “cerebral folate deficiency” which describes an individual 
with normal serum folate concentrations but low concentrations of folate in  the 
cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872] (CSF) due to impaired ability to transport folate across the blood- brain 
barrier.2  
High prevalence of FRAA in ASD : Children with ASD  have been found to have a high 
prevalence of FRAA. In a study of 93 children with ASD, 60% had blocking FRAA, and 44% had binding FRAA.
3 Blocking antibodies interfe re with binding of folate to the FR 
alpha and binding antibodies bind to the FR alpha and cause an antibody -mediated 
immune reaction. The rates of FRAA in ASD are higher than the 4 -15% prevalence 
reported in healthy adults and the 3% prevalence reported in developmentally delayed non-autistic children.
2 Up to 23% of children with ASD who underwent lumbar puncture 
were reported to have abnormally low CSF folate concentrations.4 Together, this evidence 
suggests that low CSF folate levels may contribute to the abnormal physiology and 
clinical symptoms of ASD.  
Reduced forms of folate can by[CONTACT_528649]- brain 
barrier:  Folinic acid, a reduced form of folate, is able to by[CONTACT_528650]- brain 
barrier transport mechanism and increase CSF folate levels through a secondary transport 
mechanism that involves a reduced- folate transporter. Case reports have found that high-
dose folinic acid supplementation markedl y improves CSF folate levels in children with 
ASD and low CSF fola te.2  
Folinic acid supplementation improve s language and aberrant behavior in ASD:  In a 
recent (2016) randomized controlled trial of folinic acid supplementation vs. placebo in 48 children with ASD and language delay , children randomized to folinic acid had 
statistically significant improvements in language and aberrant behavior.
2 Further more , 
improvements were greater in the subgroup of children who were positive for FRAA, suggesting that children with more severe cerebral folate deficiency w ere more likely to 
benefit (FRAA was used a proxy for CSF folate levels, since it was not possible to obtain CSF folate on study participants due to the invasive nature of obtaining CSF).  
Folate may support the 3 interdependent pathways involved in folate  (THF) -dependent 
methionine transmethylation/transsulfuration metabolism.  These pathways are involved in 
DNA synthesis, cellular methylation, and redox homeostasis, and an adequate cerebral supply of folate may allow for improved functioning of these pathw ays and clinical 
improvements.

Figure 1. This is an  overview of the 3 interdependent pathways involved in folate (THF) -
dependent methionine transmethylation/transsulfuration metabolism.  The vital importance of 
these three interconnected pathways is un derscored by [CONTACT_528651] -free DNA 
synthesis (Folate Cycle Pathway 1); for cellular methylation (epi[INVESTIGATOR_18193]) capacity (Transmethylation Pathway 2); and for the maintenance of glutathione (GSH) redox homeostasis 
(Transsulfuration Pathway 3). Because these 3 pathways regulate the distribution of precursors 
for DNA synthesis (proliferation), DNA/histone methylation (epi[INVESTIGATOR_7009]) and glutathione 
synthesis (redox/antioxidant status), the homeostatic balance between these pathways is essential 
to support normal cell programming and ontogeny during prenatal and post -natal development.  
 
In summary , children with ASD are known to have a high prevalence of cerebral folate 
deficiency, likely caused by [CONTACT_528652] -antibodies (FRAA) , which block the 
normal transfer of folate from the bloodstream to the CSF. Prior studies have documented 
that supplementation with reduced forms of folate can by[CONTACT_528653]. A recent randomized contro lled trial 
found that folinic acid supplementation improved language and behavior in children with ASD. 
We therefore propose to conduct an open -label study of folinic acid  in children with 
ASD to determine if clinical improvements are correlated with chang es in metabolites 
known to be related to the folate pathways. This study will gain information needed to determine a possible metabolomic mechanism of action of folinic acid and allow for the development of a prediction model to identify children with ASD who are mostly likely to respond to treatment.

 2 STUDY RATIONALE  
2.1 Risk / Benefit Assessment  
Risk of treatment with folinic acid : In a prior randomized controlled trial of the same dose 
and duration of treatment with folinic acid in 48 children with ASD, ther e were no serious 
side effects and no side effects that were more common with folinic acid than placebo 
treatment.  
Folinic acid is closely related molecule to the B vitamin, folate. It is approved to help with the adverse of effects of certain medications  such as methotrexate, which depletes folate 
in the body. Folinic acid is also approved to be used in combination with 
chemotherapeutic agents in certain cancers.The identification of side effects of folinic acid is somewhat confounded by [CONTACT_528654]. Adverse effects of folinic acid may include:  skin rashes, itching, facial flushing, nausea or vomiting. Acute allergic reactions have been reported – but considered rare.  
Potential benefits:
 There is a possibility that c hildren enrolled in this study will experience 
some beneficial effects related to treatment with folinic acid . As noted above, in a prior 
study of folinic acid in ASD, children were noted to have improvements in aberrant 
behavior and language development. Also, adult studies have found improvement in mood in patients treated with supplements containing folinic acid . Finally, there is biological 
plausibility that children with impaired cerebral folate transfer may have some beneficial physiological, and ther efore clinical, effects when cerebral folate levels are rais ed through 
folinic acid treatment.  
 
3 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
3.1 Primary Objective  
The primary objective is to determine if there is a correlation between changes in behavior 
and changes in urinary metabolit es in children with ASD who receive folinic acid  
treatment  for 12 weeks . This will provide insight into the potential mechanism of action. 
3.2 Secondary Objectives : 
Secondary objectives include an examination of the correlation between changes in urinary metab olites and other outcome measures, including the Social Responsiveness  
Scale (SRS) (parents and teachers) and the Ped iatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL)  
(parents) . It is possible that specific urinary metabolites are related to different clinical 
domains, and we will therefore examine correlations in each of these domains.

Urinary Metabolomic Profile  – all particip ants will have urine collected (fasting, 8am 
target collection time) at Screening  and Close -out (3 months). Urine will be stored in 
sterile containers at - [ADDRESS_686258] completed the study. Metabolomic assessment will be conducted by [CONTACT_528659] 
(Research Triangle, NC ). Metabalon is one of the largest and most established laboratories 
conducting state -of-the art metabolomics assessments  of urine, plasma, and other clinical 
samples. Metabalon has [ADDRESS_686259] been 
used in more than 500 peer -reviewed publications including numerous articles in Cell, 
Nature, and  Science. ( www.metabalon.com ) 
9 EVALUATIONS BY [CONTACT_16990]  
9.1 Visit 1 : Screening visit – t his visit will involve a face -to-face meeting with the 
study participant and their parent/legal guardian. A study team member will 
explain the entire study and obtain signed  informed consent. Study 
inclusion/exclusion criteria will be reviewed and eligible  participants will go on 
to complete all screening activities as below.  
1. Review the study with the participant and obtain written informed consent. 
2. Assign the participant a unique study ID number  
3. Record demographics data.  
4. Record medical history.  
5. Record concomitant medications.  
6. Collect urine specimen . 
7. Dispense study supplement  
8. Schedule subject for Baseline visit 
9. Record study subject weight   
9.2 Visit 2 ( Baseline) – NOTE – for this study, which will take place at the Oak Hill 
School, all enrolled children will beg in the study supplement on the same date 
(exact day TBD based on parent/teacher schedules  and CHR approval date ). 
This will improve the logistics of the study because teachers regularly complete 
outcome assessments using our established on- line outcomes pl atform at 
quarterly intervals (that match their school -based quarterly progress reports). 
This “batch” enrollment of participants has several advantages: 1) all participants will begin and end on the same date, which we believe will support 
the overall stu dy compliance and enthusiasm, as all children/families will be 
involved in the study at the same time ; 2) outcome assessments are a natural 
part of the study schedule, since they normally are completed by [CONTACT_528660] 3 months intervals and will therefo re occur as children co mplete the 3 -month 
treatment ; 3) compliance and reminders to parents/guardians and teachers will 
be simplified, since all participants will be on the same schedule and all 
Hendren  Confidential  
 
Version #:  1.0 Version Date: 11-21-17 Page 16 of 25 
 reminders can be sent in batches; 4) variation from time/seas on effects will be 
minimized, since all children will be experiencing the same school environment 
at the same period in the study.  
 
1. Parents complete Baseline Outcome Measures.  
2. Teachers complete Baseline Outcome Measures.  
3. Subject starts taking study supplem ents at this time .

10 ADVERSE EVENTS  REPORTING AND DOCUME NTATION  
10.1 Adverse Events  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation of a 
patient administered a pharmaceutical  or supplement  product and that does not necessarily 
have a causal relationship with the treatment.  An AE is therefore any unfavorabl e and

Version #:  1.0 Version Date: 11-21-[ADDRESS_686260] question for paren ts/caregivers regarding the occurrence 
of AEs since the last study visit. All information will be  record ed in the site’s source 
documents.  Adverse events will be recorded in the patient CRF.  Adverse events will be 
described by [CONTACT_24109] (start and stop da tes and times), severity, outcome, treatment and 
relation to study supplement , or if unrelated, the cause.  
AE Severity  
The National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 3.0 will  be used to asse ss and grade AE se verity.    
Table 1.  AE Severity Grading 
Severity (Toxicity Grade)  Description  
Mild (1)  Transient or mild discomfort; no limitation in activity; no medical 
intervention or therapy required. The subject may be aware of the sign or sy mptom but tolerates it reasonably well.  
Moderate (2)  Mild to moderate limitation in activity, no or minimal medical intervention/therapy required.  
Severe (3)  Marked limitation in activity, medical intervention/therapy required, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29125].  
Life-threaten ing (4)  The subject is at risk of death due to the adverse experience as it occurred. This does not refer to an experience that hypothetically 
might have caused death if it were more severe.  
 
AE Relationship to Study Supplement

10.2 Serious Adverse Events  (SAE) 
An SAE is defined as any AE occurring at any dose that results in any of the following 
outcomes:  
• death  
• a life -threatening adverse experience  
• inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_94137]  
• a persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
Other important medical events may also be considered an SAE when, based on appropriate medical judgment, they jeopardize the subject or require interv ention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed.   
10.3 Serious Adverse Experience Reporting  
We will document all SAEs that occur (whether or not related to study supplement ) per 
UCSF CHR Guidelines
.  The collection period for a ll SAEs  will begin  after informed 
consent is obtained and end after procedures for the final study visit have been completed.  
We will report all AE’s and SAE’s according to UCSF CHR guidelines.

13 STATISTICAL METHODS AND CONSIDERATIONS  
Prior to the analysis of the final study data, a detailed Statistical Analys is Plan (SAP) will 
be written describing all analyses that will be performed.  This information will be posted 
on clinicaltrials.gov to ensure that data analysis proceeds as defined a priori. Any 
modifications to the plan provided below will be noted on cl inicaltrials.gov before the first 
subject is enrolled.

urinary metabolite change and the mean behavioral measure change of 0.6, which is considered to indicate a moderate- to-strong correlation. Using a two- sided alpha o f 0.05 
and a Beta of 0.1 (90% power), our required sample size is [ADDRESS_686266] this degree of correlation. Since we may  incur  up to 20% dropout (5 participants), our target 
sample size is 30 participants, but we will allow up to 40 to provide the study opportunity to all children enrolled in the target school (Oak Hill School).  
[ADDRESS_686267] established an ongoing outcomes study that uses a web -based platform for data entry for parents and teachers. 
This platform is secure and has been reviewed for adequacy by [CONTACT_14224]  (#13-
[ZIP_CODE]). Data gathered for the study will be electronically coded into a password -protected 
database. All u ploaded files  will be stored in a database not in the server's file system, and 
the storage format will be encrypted. We will use the same secure platform for all data collection for the current study.  
14.2 Data Quality Control and Reporting 
All data entered i n this on- line system undergoes a rigorous quality control evaluation and 
pre-specified logic checks. All entries are date and time stamped, and any modifications to 
study data are flagged – the editor and time/day of edits are also recorded. As a result, the 
study database is cleaned continuously and will be ready for analysis at the completion of the last study subject visit.

Version #:  1.0 Version Date: 11-21-[ADDRESS_686270] Confidentiality  
All study forms containing PHI are kept in a secure database (named “eBit” for Evidence-
Based Intervention and Treatment)  that meets FDA criteria for electronic database 
security.  
In eBit, only UCSF study coordinators are able to create online parent and teacher accounts, which are password -protected. Data gathered for the study will be electronically 
coded into a password- protected database. All uploaded files onto eBit will  be stored in a 
database not in the server's file system, and the storage format will be encrypted. eBit uses a separate platform to handle the PHI (including parent's email addresses) that will then communicate directly with Oak Hill  platforms. This will keep the PHI separate from the 
actual health data and will meet all the IRB and HIPPA requirements that eBit and the UCSF IT group have agreed upon.  
  eBit is deployed on the Microsoft Azure secure cloud platform, which, according to their website, uses “i ndustry -standard encrypted transport protocols between user devices and 
Microsoft datacenters, and within datacenters themselves.” More information about Microsoft Azure’s security can be found at the following link: https://www.microsoft.com/en -us/TrustCenter/Security/default.aspx
 . This is the same 
server that was used in our previously approved, and still active, CHR application for our Oak Hill School outcomes study. The UCSF IT group has reviewed the terms of this web platform and has ensured that it meets all data security requirements.

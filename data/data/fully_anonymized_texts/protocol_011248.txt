Version 3 | October 2, 2020   3. Introduction  
 
Suicide  Remains  a Significant  Public  Health  Problem.  With  44,965  U.S. suicides  in 2016  (one  suicide  every  11.7  minutes),  
suicide  remains  the 10th  leading  cause  of death  among all ages  and the second leading  cause  of death  among those  10- 
[ADDRESS_644676]  remained  unchanged  for over  two decades.  In 2012,  
483,596  people  were  treated  in Emergency  Departments  (EDs)  for suicide  attempts  and non -suicidal  self-injury;  332,[ADDRESS_644677] of suicides  and suicide  attempts  in 2013  was $58.4  billion  – of this 97%  was                 
due to lost productivity;  adjusted for  underreporting,  $94.5  billion or $298  per capi[INVESTIGATOR_17399]. While  it might  be hoped  that 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_500609], it significantly increases  (up to as much  as 200 times)  for individuals  recently  
discharged.  
 
EDs face formidable  challenges  in treating these  patients  that ultimately  result  in significantly  longer  lengths  of stay 
compared to those  for medical emergencies,  lower  satisfaction,  and unnecessary  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602].  Jaspr  is an evidence - 
based  patient,  and provider  facing tablet  applica tion that  has been  funded  through  a National  Institute  of Mental  
Health (NIMH)  SBIR  grant  (R44MH108222)  and built  by [CONTACT_500649].  Jaspr  is 
designed  to reduce  unnecessary  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  length of stay (LOS)  in the  emergency  department (ED),  and  
ED/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_500610].  Jaspr  enables  delivery  of four of the five brief  
interventions  recommended by  [CONTACT_500650]  (SPRC)  including brief  patient  education,  safety  
planning,  lethal  means  counseling,  and caring contacts  post -discharge.  
 
For the patient, Jaspr  has four primary  sections:  
1. Suicide  Risk Assessment:  Through the  use of a virtual  guide,  Jaspr  walks  the patient  through the Collaborative  
Assessment  and Management of Suicidality (CAMS)  - an evidence -based  suicide  risk assessment  that includes  
crisis  and lethal  means safety  planning.  Data  from  the assessment  will be provided to the provider  as a decision  
support  tool in report  form and the crisis  safety  and lethal means safety  plans  will be available  for the patient  to 
take  home.  CAMS  was developed  by [CONTACT_500651],  PhD for use by [CONTACT_500652],  assess,  and treat    suicidal  
patients.  
 
CAMS  was developed  by [CONTACT_500653],  PhD for use by [CONTACT_500652],  assess,  and treat  suicidal  patients.  
CAMS  is a non-prescriptive,  atheoretical  therapeutic framework  for patients  drawn  to suicide  as a way of 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  CAMS  is a highly  flexible  treatment  that can  be used  as a brief  intervention,  as an  add-on to an existing  
treatment,  or as a short -term  (6-8 session)  treatment.  CAMS  is a highly  collaborative method for  understanding  
and treating  patient -defined “drivers” for suicide.  CAMS  is guided  by [CONTACT_941] “Suicide  Status Form” (SSF)  which  is 
used  to assess  the patient’s  own  ratings  of suicide  risk, including reasons  for living and dying  (Section A), along  
with key suicide  risk and warning signs  relevant  to imminent risk  (Section B), which  lead  to stabilization  
planning,  suicide -specific  treatment,  and a better -informed  disposition for  care  (Section  C). CAMS  Stabilization  
Plan  includes: reducing access  to lethal  means,  developi[INVESTIGATOR_500611],  and identifying people  to call for help,  which is supplemented by  [CONTACT_500654] -specific  interventions.  Three  published RCTs  (Comtois  et al., 2011;  Andreasson  et al., 2016;  Jobes  et 
al., 2017),  eight  non-randomized  trials  (Jobes,  Jacoby,  Cimbolic,  & Hustead,  1997;  Ellis, Rufino,  Allen, Fowler,  & 
Jobes,  2015;  Ellis,  Green, Allen,  Jobes,  & Nadorff,  2012;  Arkov,  Rosenbaum,  Christiansen,  Jonsson,  Munchow,  
2008;  Jobes,  Kahn -Green,  Greene,  & Goeke -Morey,  2009;  Nielsen, Alberdi,  & Rosenbaum,  2011;  Jobes,  Wong,  
Conrad,  Drozd,  & Neal -Walden, 2005;  Ellis,  Rufino,  & Allen,  2017),  and two not yet published RCTs  across  
multiple  treatment settings  provide  replicated  evidence  that CAMS  reliably  outperforms  control  conditions  in 
reducing suicidal  ideation,  overall  symptom  distress,  and depression,  while  increasing  hope,  patient   
satisfaction,  and care  retention.  Recent  RCTs  provide  promising  evidence  that CAMS  reduces  self-harm  and 
suicide  attempts  (Andreass on et al., 2016)  and that standard CAMS  significantly  decreases  ED visits  among

Version 3 | October 2, 2020   suicidal  military  sub-samples  (Jobes  et al., 2005;  Huh et al.,  2017).  
 
2. Shared Stories:  The app contains  a robust  collection  of videos  from  people  who have  lived  experience  with  
suicide  sharing their  personal  stories  to inspi[INVESTIGATOR_500612].  
 
3. Comfort  and Skills:  Through a variety  of activities  and videos,  the app teaches  the patient  copi[INVESTIGATOR_500613] -discharge.  
 
4. Take  Away  Kit (“Jaspr -at-Home”) : A companion  mobile  app accompanies the patient home  for continued  use 
during the  highest  period  of suicide  risk post -discharge.  The patient  has the ability  to save  activities  and videos  
from  the app to their  crisis  safety plan which is then  available  to them  post  discharge.  Additionally,  there  are 
more  advanced  skill building tools  and activities  available  to the patient  post  discharge  that can be  customized  
by [CONTACT_13917].  
 
For the provider:  
• Jaspr  will generate  a provider  decision support  report  based  on the CAMS  interview  that can be printed  or 
faxed  to the provider. In the future  (but not during the length  of this study),  the patient  data  will be integrated  
into the EMR.  
• Allow  the provider  to select  additional  skills  and activities  that will be available  to the patient post  discharge.  
• Create  custom  “Caring Contacts”  that will be delivered to the patient  at definable  intervals  post  discharge  
 
This NIMH -funded  research involves  two research  phases: a formative  evaluation  and a summative evaluation . 
 
The formative  evaluation  (SIRB  #7097) occurred first  and will  continue  throughout  the length  of the research  project.  Its 
purpose  is to gather  invaluable  information as we design and improve  all features  for patient  and provider  users  of the 
technology  to ensure  its acceptability,  ease  of use, and clinical relevance  to achieve  the intended  outcomes,  such as: 
decreasing suicidal  behavior,  length  of stay in the ED, unnecessary  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  readmission,  liability,  and increasing  
ability  to manage  suicidal  crises and satisfaction with  ED experience.  
 
The focus  of this summative  evaluation  is to evaluate  Jaspr  (N=120) and JAH  (N=60)  in clinical trials.  The ED clinical trial  
compares  Jaspr  to Care -as-Usual  (CAU)  in EDs nationwide;  the Telehealth  clinical  trial compares  JAH to CAU  + crisis  
safety plan.  Patient  participants  meeting  study  criteria  for the ED study  will be randomly  assigned  to receive  Jaspr  (in 
addition to  their  usual  care;  n=60)  or CAU  only (the treatment  that is  standardly  provided  to suicidal  patients  in the  ED; 
n=60).  Patients  participants  in the  ED study  who  are assigned  to the Jaspr  condition will  receive  access  to JAH for use 
throughout  the follow  up period as they  see fit. Outpatient  participants  meeting  study  criteria for  the Telehealth study  
will be randomly  assigned  to receive  JAH (in addition to  their  usual  care;  n=30)  or CAU  (in addition to  crisis  safety  
planning;  n=30).  We will also conduct  a small (N=15)  ED study  pi[INVESTIGATOR_500614]. The research procedures  for the pi[INVESTIGATOR_500615]. All 
modifications  will be submitted  to IRB prior  to implementation.  
 
Patient  participants in the ED study  will be asked to complete  study  sessions  (interview  and online  surveys) at four  time  
points: at the time  of ED admission,  and at 7-days,  30-days,  and 90-days  after  ED admission.  Outpatient participants  in 
the Telehealth  study  will be asked  to complete  study  sessions  at three  time  points:  baseline,  30- and 90 -days  after  the 
initial session.  The initial  session  of the ED study  will be conducted in -person in a private space  provided  by [CONTACT_500655]/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]  (e.g.,  the patient’s  room  or another  private  environment) ; the initial  session  of the Telehealth  
study  will be conducted remotely.  Each  follow  up assessment  will be conducted  remotely  consisting of a brief  phone

Version 3 | October 2, 2020   interview  and a set of surveys  administered  online.  
 
The ED study  will also include  provider  participants  who  will be asked  to complete  a demographics survey and a brief  
interview  about  each  of their  index  study  patients  after  their intervention with  the patient  is complete.  The brief  
interview  will be administered in -person  and assess  the provider’s  feeling  of preparedness  for the assessment,  the 
patient’s  degree  of distress  at the time  of encounter,  helpfulness  of Jaspr’s  clinical  support  tool in  discharge  disposition  
determination,  and risk assessment  (if applicable).  
 
ED study  primary outcome  variables include:  suicidality  (death  by [CONTACT_20673],  suicide  attempts,  suicidal  ideation),  
ED/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_103978],  discharge  disposition,  use of restraints  while  in ED (chemical,  physical),  intensity  ratings  of acute  
distress, self -efficacy  in copi[INVESTIGATOR_332173],  use of imminent distress  intervention and copi[INVESTIGATOR_25110],  and helpfulness  of 
their  ED encounter.  Jaspr  condition -specific  outcomes  will be examined  and reported descriptively.  These  include  tools  
accessed  during and after  the ED visit,  perceived  usefulness  and satisfaction of Jaspr  brief intervention components,  and 
usage  of provider/patient  apps  and their  features.  
 
Telehealth  study  primary  outcome variables  include:  suicidality  (death  by [CONTACT_20673],  suicide  attempts,  suicidal  ideation);  
Crisis -related  healthcare  utilization (ED visits,  psychiatric  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  calls  to crisis  line; crisis  calls  to therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541];  
Outpatient  Satisfaction; Use  of evidence -based  interventions  to reduce  suicide  risk (safety  planning,  lethal  means  
management,  behavioral  skills).  Secondary  outcomes  include:  Reasons  for living; Psychological distress  (depression,  
anxiety,  stress);  Cognitions  associated  with suicide  risk (hope,  optimism,  pessimism).  
 
The primary  hypotheses  include:  
1. Jaspr  patients  will report  significantly  greater  decrease  in suicidality  and ED/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_500616] -up assessments.  
2. Jaspr  patients  will report  significantly  greater  increases  in self-efficacy  in copi[INVESTIGATOR_500617],  use of acute  
crisis  tolerance  skills,  and perceived  helpfulness  of the care  they  receive  compared  to CAU  patients.  
3. Jaspr  patients  will report  high  levels  of satisfaction with Jaspr.  
 
Secondary  hypotheses  for the ED study  include  that medical  providers  will rate the Jaspr  clinical support  tools  as helpful  
in preparing for and  assessing suicide  risk and  patient’s  degree  of distress  at the time  of their  encounter  and aiding in 
discharge  disposition plan.  We will also examine  if providers  rate themselves  as more  confident in their  suicide  risk 
assessment  with  patients  assigned  to the Jaspr  condition compared  to those  assigned  to the CAU  condition.  
 
The procedures  defined  within  this document  pertain  only to the procedures  performed during the  summative  
evaluation . 
 
A. Type  of Research  
 
The studies  involves  behavioral research.  Our goal  is to digitize  and automate  a number  of scientifically  validated  
processes  to ensure  that suicidal  patients  in the emergency  department receive  them.  The focus  of the  studies  is to 
compare  the effects  of Jaspr  versus  CAU  with suicidal  patients  in the ED as well as JAH versus  CAU  with  outpatients  
experiencing suicidality,  with  the former  having  particular interest  in suicidality,  ED/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_103978],  self-efficacy,  
and treatment  satisfaction.  
 
B. Purpose/Objective  of the Study  
The overall  purpose  of the ED study  is to evaluate  the app we recently  developed,  called  Jaspr,  that can be  used  on a 
tablet  and/or  smartphone  by [CONTACT_500656].  Jaspr  also includes  a companion  mobile  
app patients may  use after  discharge  on their smartphone.  Jaspr  is designed  to reduce  unnecessary  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  
length  of stay in the ED, and ED/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_500618]-Based Practice Institute | [ADDRESS_644680] SW, Seattle WA [ZIP_CODE] | [PHONE_10384] | [EMAIL_9537]  
Page  6 of 24 
Version 3 | October 2, 2020   ED providers  (e.g.,  nurses,  social  workers,  physicians).  The overall purpose  of the Telehealth  study  is to evaluate  the 
effectiveness  of the companion mobile  app,  called  Jaspr -at-Home,  that can  be used  by [CONTACT_500657],  when  implemented in a telehealth context.  
 
C. Background  of the Study  
 
In our Phase  I preliminary  research for  this project,  we developed  and tested the feasibility  of a Jaspr  prototype  (called  
Virtual  CAMS)  for “proof  of concept”.  The prototype,  for use with  suicidal  ED patients  and medical  providers  was based  
on a nurse  avatar  (“Louise”)  that reduced  readmissions  through enhanced  medical  discharge  planning,  included  “[CONTACT_500698]”  (based  on CAMS  treatment developer,  David Jobes,  PhD)  to administer  a CAMS -oriented Suicide  Status  Interview  
(SSI;  based  on the Suicide  Status  Form,  SSF) and a clinical  decision -making support  tool for providers  that summarizes  
the patient’s  suicide  risk based  on the SSI. 
 
Proof  of concept was determined  in two stages: (1)  a formative  evaluation during the  iterative  development  of Jaspr  
where feedback  was obtained  from  target  end-users, and (2) a  summative  evaluation consisting  of a feasibility  test 
(usability,  acceptability,  satisfaction)  of “[CONTACT_500699]”  with suicidal  ED patients.  During this  preliminary  study,  we visited  
Mayo  Clinic,  HealthPartners’  and four  Allina  Health EDs to understand their  workflow  and discuss with  administrators  to 
understand their  challenges  treating suicidal  ED patients.  We met with  over  25 Allina  administrators  and ED directors  to 
discuss  how  innovative  technologies  like Jaspr  might  improve  ED services.  We developed  and tested  all Jaspr  elements  
proposed  for Phase  I: (1) a tablet -based  avatar  (“[CONTACT_500700]”)  performing a 15-minute  segment  of the CAMS  SSI; (2) the 
discharge  disposition clinical  decision support  tool that distills  Jaspr  SSI content  into an easy -to-review  provider  report  
(content  and graphics  only);  and (3) “Caring Contacts” post -discharge  messages.  We also developed  two videos  of peer  
specialists  with lived  experience  with suicide  (generating hope)  and videos  of [CONTACT_500701]  introducing patients to the SSI for  
later  testing  of whether  suicidal  ED patients  preferred vid eos to an avatar.  
 
In Phase II  preliminary  research,  we conducted  extensive  research  and analysis  of competitor  apps  to analyze  market  
competition and gathered ideas  about  designs  and content  to include  in Jaspr. Design summit  meetings  were  held to  
further refine  the initial  design of the app.  In collaboration  with systems  stakeholders,  various  personas  were  created to  
better  understand the  workflow  in the  ED. Personas  for different patient journeys  in the ED were  created,  as well  as 
personas  for loved  ones accompanying the  patient,  business  development leaders,  masters -level  assessors,  ED 
physicians,  and stakeholders. Patient personas  were  informed  by [CONTACT_500658]  15 people  with  lived  experience  (PLE)  
who previously  sought  ED services  during their  suicide  crises.  During this  phase,  user -centered research  was conducted  
to obtain  feedback  about  Jaspr’s  patient -facing features. Patients  in the  ED and inpatient  unit were  interviewed at 
Harborview  Medical  Center,  Mayo Clinic,  and Allina  Heal th. With  consultation  from  suicide  experts,  we received  
validation  and enhanced  understanding to develop Caring Contacts  content  for the app.  We also created  3.[ADDRESS_644681] day/week  out of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307],  and “my wish  for you”.  These  video  
clips  were  culled  and tested within the  NowMattersNow.org collection  of behavioral skills  to include  in Jaspr -at-Home  a 
companion  mobile  app patients  may  use on their  own  smartphone  after  discharge.  
 
Preliminary  Findings:  Four  important  findings  emerged  through our initial  Phase  I, 80+ hours  of testing and interviews.  
First,  administrators  and providers  universally  viewed  tablets  as acceptable  technology  to deliver  Jaspr  as patients  are 
always  under  observation  – either  directly monitored  in open -spaces  or with cameras  when  in a closed  room.  Second,  
they  excluded  only  psychotic  and/or  severely  agitated  patients  as inappropriate  to use Jaspr. Third,  all participants  
liked  the hope -instilling videos  by [CONTACT_66256]/peer  specialists  and viewed  them  as a nice counterbalance  to the “[CONTACT_500698]”  SSI. Finally,  patient  participants  preferred  a simple  avatar  (like  “Nurse  Louise”)  using a computer -generated  
voice  instead  of video delivery  of CAMS  or use of [CONTACT_500701]’  actual  voice  for “[CONTACT_500699].” Stated  plainly  by [CONTACT_500659],  “It’s clear  that the avatar  is a computer  and not a  person trying to get into my head.” While  not all suicidal

Page  7 of 24 
Version 3 | October 2, 2020   patients  felt strongly  in their  preference,  all found the  simple  avatar  acceptable  and valuable  to use. 
 
Preliminary  study  results from  the Phase  II user -centered research are similarly  positive,  with  95%  of participants  
endorsing that  they  would  save  the content they encountered for  use after  leaving the  ED, 100%  identified  the features  
as “helpful”,  and 100%  indicated they would like to see the app available  for use in EDs for suicidal  individuals.  
 
4. Participant  Selection  
 
A. Inclusion  and Exclusion  Criteria  
 
All participants  must  be 18 years  or older  and English -speaking  (Jaspr  is currently  only available  in English.  A Spanish  
version will  be developed  after  the English  version of Jaspr  is successfully  commercialized).  
 
Patient  Participants:  
ED Study Inclusion Criteria : Patient  participants  must:  1) currently  be in the ED seeking treatment for  suicidal  behavior;  
2) be medically  and clinically1 stable  as deemed  by [CONTACT_500660]’s  care  
team;  3) have  access  to a computer  or other  device  (smartphone,  tablet)  with Internet  connection;  4) have  access  and 
regularly  use an Apple  or Android smartphone;  5) have  a stable  address and housing  for the last 30 days.  
 
Telehealth Study  Patient Inclusion Criteria : 1) Currently  receiving  outpatient treatment  services  for suicidality;  2) have  
access  to a computer  or other device  (smartphone,  tablet)  with Internet  connection;  3) currently  has and regularly  uses  an 
Apple  or Android  smartphone; 4) has a stable  address  and housing.  
 
Patient  Exclusion Criteria : Patients  who  are 1) acutely  psychotic,  severely  agitated;2 patients  with  significant  intoxication  
or other impairment that may  interfere  with providing consent  and meaningful  feedback  (as determined  by [CONTACT_500661]);  2) have  no access  or way to access  phone  or computer  (or other  device)  with  Internet  connection;  
and 3) homeless  or have unstable  housing in the past  30 days  will be excluded  from  the study.  
 
Additional  Exclusion Criterion (Telehealth Study  only) : Prior  use of Jaspr /Jaspr -at-Home.  
 
Provider  Participants  (ED study  only):  
Inclusion Criteria : Providers  must  be currently  serving  in the ED as a medical  provider who  treats  patients  with suicidal  
behaviors.  There  are no exclusion criteria.  
 
B. Gender  
 
The research  team will maintain a focused effort  on ensuring that  the percent  of women  participants  recruited  for this 
study  are representative  of the broader  group of target  end-users.  Women  as well as men will be eligible  for participation 
in this study.  Because of the overrepresentation  of men who present to emergency  departments  as suicidal,  it is 
expected  men will represent approximately  60%  of our sample  population.  Pregnant  women will not be excluded  from 
this study  and method  of birth control  will not be measured  as this research will  impose no risk to the fetus.  
 
C. Racial/Ethnic  Origin  
 
Our goal is  to achieve  a minimum of 25%  involvement  by [CONTACT_500662].  [CONTACT_412896] has successfully  employed  a number  of approaches  in her previous  research to reach  
recruitment  targets,  in particular with  respect  to ethnic  and racial  minorities.  If needed,  we will pursue  these  approaches  
Evidence-Based Practice Institute | [ADDRESS_644683] SW, Seattle WA [ZIP_CODE] | [PHONE_10384] | [EMAIL_9537]  
Page  8 of 24 
Version 3 | October 2, 2020   including:  Significantly  expanding recruitment efforts  in ethnically  and racially  diverse  geographic  locations,  and to 
agencies serving  ethnic  and racial  minorities,  and taking a much  more  active,  personal  approach throughout  the 
recruitment  effort.  This latter  approach  often involves  identifying what  matters  to the  organization  in advance  and 
seeking  ways  to link our requ est to their  needs/interests/mission.  This approach  may  involve  visiting (either  virtually  or 
directly)  the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_500619]-service,  as requested by  [CONTACT_14900].  We can easily  provide  these  
services  through our online  community  format.  
 
Should we continue  to encounter  difficulty  meeting  our targets  for recruitment  of ethnic  and racial  minority  participants  
after  applying  these  methods,  we will form  an ethnic  and racial  minority  recruitment advisory  committee,  chaired  by 
[CONTACT_500663],  PhD,  an expert  on cross -cultural  clinical  research  and a close  colleague  of [CONTACT_500702]’s.  The task force  will 
then examine  recruitment  efforts  to date  in an effort  to identify  potential  problems  or barriers  to access  that may  
account  for the continued  low enrollment.  Solutions  will then be generated, implemented, and reevaluated.  We will 
seek  input  from this  advisory  board  as needed to ensure  we have  fulfilled  our stated  aims  described  here.  
 
D. Vulnerable  Populations  
 
The risk to participants  in this research  is minimal  when  applying NIMH risk  standards  and designations.  According to  
these NIMH guidelines,  “minimal  risk to subjects  means  that the probability  and magnitude  of harm  or discomfort  
anticipated in the research  are not greater  than  those  ordinarily  encountered in daily  life or during the performance  of 
routine  physical and psychological  examinations  or tests  and that  confidentiality  is adequately  protected.  This category  
includes  protoc ols that pose  “no greater  than  minimal  risk”  according to  federal  regulations.”  
 
This study  does  include  patients  who  are currently  acutely  suicidal  and/or  recently  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_500620].  By 
[CONTACT_108],  these  patients  are inherently  high -risk participants;  however,  the question to  consider  for this research is 
whether  the study  procedures  are likely  to make  the participants  more  suicidal.  We believe  the answer  is no. Past  
research  found that  many  of the patient  participants  enjoyed  providing  their feedback  during the  interview  sessions  and 
having their  opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]/perspective  valued. Some  also described  that for the moments  they  were  interacting  with the 
research  team,  their  mind  was off their  worries.  Preliminary  data  from  our non-randomized  observational  research  has 
demonstrated  that suicidal  patients  feel less distressed following  contact  [CONTACT_500664]. Our  
research  to date  has demonstrated  a 30%  reduction in overall self -report  ratings  of distress  for suicidal  ED patients  
engaged  in our research. Given  the minimal  risk nature  of this study,  the likely  causes of such adverse  events  are likely  to 
be factors  related  to their  ED experience  (e.g.,  nicotine  withdrawal  while  in ED, fear/anxiety  about  what  to expect,  
restrained  on gurney,  etc.)  that co-occur  or overlap with  their  engagement in our research,  particularly  during their  ED 
stay.  Unique  research factors  may  include  one or more  of the following:  length  of the assessment,  or interrupted use  of 
Jaspr  to attend  to medic al providers’  interventions.  
 
E. Age 
 
Participants  under  the age of [ADDRESS_644684] (and  ED pi[INVESTIGATOR_20635]),  
we will gather  data  from  approximately  135 suicidal  ED patients  (no fewer  than 90  patients)  and their  health  care

Version 3 | October 2, [ADDRESS_644686]  to spend an average  of eight  days  at each  site, with  capacity  to increase  our 
time  at each  if needed.  For the Telehealth  study,  we will gather  data  from  approximately  60 outpatients  experiencing  
suicidality.  Outpatient  participants  will be recruited from  clinics  represented  in the Dialectical  Behavioral  Ther apy (DBT)  
Clinics Consortium  (including Portland DBT  Institute,  Tampa  Bay Center  for Cognitive  Behavioral  Therapy, DBT Institute  
of Michigan)  and,  if needed,  through  an online  distribution list of providers  serving suicidal  patients  (ZeroSuicide,  AAS,  
and DBT listservs).  
 
5. Study  Design  / Method  / Procedures  
 
A. Summary  of the Research  Design  
 
EBPI  [INVESTIGATOR_500621].  
Research  with participants  will occur  onsite or remotely  (via telephone  and computer).  For the ED study, each project  
performance  site will  decide  if they  prefer  EBPI  [INVESTIGATOR_500622]  a qualified researcher  to conduct  the research  in conjunction  with EBPI  [CONTACT_33365].  EBPI  [INVESTIGATOR_500623].  If applicable,  EBPI  [INVESTIGATOR_500624]  (virtually or in-person)  in the ED study  research protocol  and procedures  prior  to 
commencing research at each site,  including training in approach ing potential participants  without  coercion  and the 
informed  consent  process.  Moreover,  all individuals  engaging in research  will be required to  complete  training in 
protection  of human subjects  in research,  HIPAA  training,  and Good  Clinical  Practices  education.  Course  completion  
certificates  will be kept  up to date  during the  study  and stored  by [CONTACT_500665]  [INVESTIGATOR_500625].  
 
Formal  screening and the informed  consent  process  will be performed  by [CONTACT_500666].  Informed  consent  procedures  will be fully  and thoroughly  conducted by  a researcher  (e.g.,  orienting  
prospective  participants  to the study  details,  highlighting that  they  are under  no obligation  to participation in the study,  
and that  a decision  to decline  participation will  not affect  their  care,  in the case  of patients,  or employment,  in the case  
of providers)  onsite or remotely.  
 
ED Study  
Patient  Participants:  Because  the patient’s  medical  treatment  is of foremost  importance  and to  accommodate  the fluid,  
unpredictable  environments  in the  ED and to work  within their  usual  flow,  the researchers  will pause  all research  
procedures  whenever  necessary  to allow  for the patient’s  medical  care  and resume  should  there  be addi tional  periods  
of waiting.  Once enrollment is complete  (i.e.,  consent is obtained),  the researchers  will request  a release  of information  
from  the participant  for information  we would like to gather  from  a member  of their  care  team  after  the patient’s  
discharge.  Specifically,  we are interested  in collecting  data  about  the patient’s  length  of stay,  if physical  or chemical  
restraints  were  used  and if so for how  long,  their  final  discharge  disposition (e.g.,  if the patient was  admitted  to 
inpatient,  residential,  or substance  abuse  treatment  or discharged  to home),  and if the patient  was admitted  whether  it 
was involuntary  or voluntary. This  data  will be obtained  orally  by [CONTACT_500667]  a member  of the patient’s  care team;  
medical  records  will not be accessed  by [CONTACT_41314]. Permission (or  not) for this release  of information  will not  
impact  the patient’s  participation in the study  (i.e.,  if they  decline to provide  permission for this release,  they may  still 
participate  in the study).  If the patient  agrees  to provide  permission  for the researcher  to collect  this information,  they  
will be asked to sign a release  of information form.  
 
The researcher  will then conduct  the baseline  assessment  and the researcher  will randomize  the patient  to condition  
while  the participant  is completing  baseline  measures.  The researcher  will inform  the patient  of the condition they  have

Page  10 of 24 
Version 3 | October 2, [ADDRESS_644688]  treatment  interview  and online  surveys.  If the patient is assigned  to the Jaspr  
condition, the researcher  will walk  the patient  through a supplement  consent  form  to provide  further  information about  
the app  and obtain  their  electronic  or paper/pencil signature.  The researcher  will orient  the patient to the app on the 
study  tablet,  help  them  to set  up their  account,  and let them  know  they  may  use Jaspr  however  they  choose  for up to 
two hours,  not including breaks they  may  request  or that may  be needed  in order  to receive  their  standard  medical  care.  
The researcher  will remain  with the patient  at all  times  while  using Jaspr  to answer  any questions  that the patient  may  
have  about  Jaspr  or the study;  the researcher  will not engage  with  the patient  otherwise. After  two hours  of Jaspr  use, 
the researcher  will ask the patient  to pause  their  use of Jaspr  and conduct  the post  treatment interview  and online  
surveys.  If the patient  indicates  they are finished  using Jaspr  prior  to the two hour  timeframe,  the researcher  will conduct  
the post  treatment  interview  and online  surveys  at that  time.  After  the post  treatm ent surveys  are completed,  
researchers  will orient the patient  to installing the  Jaspr -at-Home  mobile  app on their smartphone  and ask  them to use it 
however  they see  fit after  being discharged. If the patient  does  not have  access  to their  smartphone  or if they prefer  to 
install the  app after  they  leave  the ED, the researcher  will provide  email instructions  for accessing  and installing  Jaspr - 
at-Home.  
 
Patient  participants  will be asked  to contact  [CONTACT_500668].  Time  spent  completing  the initial  session (i.e., eligibility,  consent,  randomization,  baseline,  scheduling,  and 
post  assessment)  is estimated  to take  approximately  2 – [ADDRESS_644689] -treatment interview  and surveys  are completed  in the ED, the onsite  researcher  will explain the  purpose  
of blinding researchers  to participants’  condition and then  virtually  introduce  (e.g.,  via Zoom,  FaceTime)  the patient  
participant  to the (blinded)  EBPI  [INVESTIGATOR_500626] -discharge  follow -up 
assessments3. This  research  assistant will remain  blind to  the patient’s  condition  during this  discussion and the 7- , 30, 
and most  of the 90-day follow  up assessment time  points.  At the very  end of the 90-day assessment,  the research  
assistant will be asking  condition -specific  questions  (e.g.,  usability  questions  about  the patient’s experience  with the 
Jaspr  app)  and thus  cannot  be blind during this  assessment  time  point.  In an effort  to ensure  a warm  hand -off from the 
ED-based  researcher  to the follow -up blinded assessor,  the blinded  research  assistant  will schedule  the three  follow  up 
assessments  and administer  the Participant  Information Form.  
 
Because  the site contact  [CONTACT_500669],  we do 
not anticipate  that participation in the study  will lead  to significant  distress.  However,  the researchers  will be attentive  to 
changes  in mood states  and,  if indicated,  will check  in verbally  with  the participant  about  whether  they  wish  to continue.  
If a participant  becomes  more  distressed during the  meeting for  whatever  reason (e.g.,  due to length  of waiting               
in the  ED, an upsetting conversation  with  medical personnel,  or some  aspect of the research  procedure),  the researchers  
will again ask if they prefer  to discontinue  the study.  We prefer  not to automatically  discontinue  the study  in cases   
where  their  distress  is caused  by [CONTACT_500670].  We will however  inquire  about their  
preference  to discontinue.  We will also inform  the site cont act or their  designee  and a member  of the patient’s  
care team  that the patient  appears more  upset  than at  the start of the research  procedure.  In cases  where  the patient  
appears more  distressed  than  they were  at the start  of the procedure  and displays  difficulty  redirecting to research  
tasks,  we will discontinue  the study  procedure  and notify  the site contact  [CONTACT_500671] a member  of the 
patient’s  care  team . 
 
Follow  up assessments  will occur remotely  via phone  and internet  7-, 30-, and 90-days  after  baseline.  At the pre-

Page  11 of 24 
Version 3 | October 2, [ADDRESS_644691]  the semi -structured  
interview.  
 
The researcher  will conclude  the assessment  by [CONTACT_500672],  urge  to self-harm,  intent  
to kill self, intent  to physically  harm  self using a 7-point  Likert  scale  (based  on [CONTACT_500703] ’s UWRAMP  protocol ). 
If the patient endorses  a score  of 5 or greater  on urges  to harm  self or others  or if a patient  participant  becomes  
distressed during  or immediately  after  the follow  up assessment,  the researcher  will do a warm  hand  off to Boys  Town  
and inform  the study  PI [INVESTIGATOR_97318].  Boys  Town  Hotline  is staffed  by a specialized team of crisis  counselors  trained  in 
providing suicide  risk assessments  by [CONTACT_500673]’s  Suicide   
Risk Assessment Standards.  Boys  Town  Hotline  will provide  telephone  crisis  intervention services  and will provide  the 
research  staff  documentation,  including information given during the  call, the nature  of the call, responses  given, and 
other  evaluative  data  elements, to the study  PI [INVESTIGATOR_874] 24 hours. Boys  Town  will utilize  their national  internal  database  of 
service  referrals  to provid e further action for  the participant  if deemed  necessary.  If the crisis  counselor  determines  the 
participant’s  situation as  life threatening,  they  will notify  a senior  counselor  who  will determine  the level  of assistance  
needed  (i.e.,  if another  party  should be  contact[INVESTIGATOR_530],  facilitation  of contact  [CONTACT_500674], and  monitor  the call while  
crisis  counselor  endeavors  to remain  actively  engaged  with  the participant).  
 
Provider  Participants : The ED providers  and other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_500627].  The researchers  will provide  further  information as needed  for providers  to refer  patients  to the study.  
Interested  provider  participants  will enroll in the study  prior  to referring potential  patient  participants.  After  enrollment  
is complete,  the researcher  will set up the  provider’s  Jaspr  account  and provide  a brief  introduction  to the app.  
 
After  their  index  patient  is enrolled  in the study,  the researchers  will inform  the provider  of their  patient’s  study  
condition  via the method preferred by [CONTACT_500675] (e.g.,  verbally  in person,  via 
page  or text message;  no identifying information  will be included  by [CONTACT_500676]).  Providers  
will be asked to treat  their  enrolled  patient  participants  utilizing either  the care  they  typi[INVESTIGATOR_500628],  depending to which  condition the  patient  is assigne d (CAU  or Jaspr,  
respectively).  While  providers  are treating a patient participant  assigned  to the Jaspr  condition,  they will be asked  to 
utilize  the provider  summary  reports  and other  tools  within  Jaspr  as they  see best,  guided  by [CONTACT_500677].  
Once  the disposition dis charge  report  is available  from  the patient  participant’s  use of Jaspr,  the researcher  will print  it 
out and provide  this report  to the provider  participant  to use as they  see fit. After  their  index  patient  has used  Jaspr  for up 
to two hours  (not counting  breaks) or received  usual  care for two hours,  all providers  will be asked to complete  a brief 
post  treatment interview.  They may  also choose  to complete  the survey on paper  or online  if they  prefer.  In the case  of a 
patient  participant  having  multiple  providers  (e.g.,  social worker),  the researcher will gather  feedback  from  the ED 
physician or main  provider  and then  from  the other  providers  who also treated the  patient  participant  given these  other 
providers  also have  enrolled  in the study.  Participation time  for providers  per patient  is approximately  5 minutes  including 
enrollment procedures.  
 
Telehealth  Study  
Outpatient  individuals  experiencing suicidality  will learn  of the study  opportunity from  their  outpatient  provider.  
Interested  outpatients  will complete  the enrollment process  with  a researcher  over  computer  screenshare  and/or  
telephone.  This includes eligibility  screening,  informed consent, and randomization  to JAH or CAU.  The baseline  and 
follow -up assessments  will be scheduled  at the end of the call. Participants  will be paid  $25 for each  completed  
assessment

Page  12 of 24 
Version 3 | October 2, [ADDRESS_644693]  data  including the 
participant’s  experience  with  suicidality,  depressive  and anxiety  symptoms,  stress,  copi[INVESTIGATOR_500629],  
satisfaction with  outpatient  care  and JAH.  Participants  assigned  to the JAH condition will  be oriented  to the Jaspr  Health  
app through Zoom  screenshare,  and will complete  (via telehealth) a comprehensive  suicide  assessment  within Jaspr.  
Based  on the Suicide  Status  Interview  (SSI)  from  the CAMS approach,  the JAH chatbot  will also conduct  lethal  means  
counseling and assist  the participant  in building a stability  plan as part of the comprehensive  assessment.  Participants  
will also be  able  to select  behavioral skills  from  Jaspr  Health to  include  in their stabilization plan as well as  videos  of 
people  with lived  experience  to provide  insight,  wisdom,  and hope.  To mimic  a telehealth workflow,  the researcher  will 
provide  access  to Jaspr  Health  via Zoom  and guide  the participant’s  engagement  with different  components  of the 
platform  until  they  have  completed  the SSI and fully  built  out their stability  plan.  Once  completed, the Jaspr  Health  
platform  will provide  the participant  with  access  to JAH.  Before  concluding the  call, the researcher  (functioning as a 
mental  health  technician)  will ensure  the participant  is able  to download,  register,  and reliably  use JAH on their  PC, 
phone,  tablet,  or other  hardware.  
 
We will schedule three brief (5 -10 minutes) support check in calls with each participant to take place at 72 hours, one 
week, and three weeks  after they receive access to their study materials (JAH or safety planning packet) . During these 
calls, a research er will answer any questions about the app or the safety planning materials , inquire if they are using 
the materials, and assess any barriers to use . These calls are similar to getting a call from  a medical provider’s  office 
(not from the provider themselv es, but office staff) to check in on their patient after surgery or other  procedure to 
check in on pain, comfort, got what they need ; our staff will be checking in on the participants . Just as the office staff 
member making the call doesn’t delve into the specifics of the medical problem, we also won’t  delve into their 
suicidality or other problem behaviors . If the participant needs, warm handoff procedures will be used to connect 
them with a crisis counselor at Boys Town .  
 
The follow -up assessments  conducted  at 30- and [ADDRESS_644694]  preferred by  [CONTACT_2299]  (i.e., email  or text).  At the time  of the scheduled follow -up 
appointment, the researcher  will call the participant’s  primary  phone  and subsequently  attempt  to reach  them via text 
and email  if there  is no answer.  During the  follow -up assess ments,  the researcher  will send  the participant  a link to 
complete  the online  surveys  and verbally  provide  their  study  ID number. After  the surveys  are completed, the  
researcher  will proceed to the semi -structured interview  which  will include questions  collecting  information  such as the 
participant’s  thoughts  and experience  with  suicide  since  the prior  study  session  and their use of resources  (JAH and the 
crisis  stability  plan,  if applicable).  The debrief  interview  from  the UWRAMP  will be conducted following  each 
assessment.  In the event  that the participant  meets  or exceeds  the distress  threshold,  we will utilize  the Warm  Handoff  
procedure  and connect  the participant  to a crisis  counselor  at Boys  Town,  as described  above.  
 
All participants  will be given  access  to use JAH for 30-days  should  they  wish  to do so following  the completion of their  
final  study  assessment.  
 
B. Analysis  of Study  Results  
 
During the  summative evaluation,  data  gathered  is qualitative  and quantitative  in nature. Online  survey measures  will be 
administered  at four time  points  (baseline,  post  treatment,  7-day follow  up, 30-day follow  up, and 90-day follow  up) to 
all ED study  patient  participants  and three  time  points  (baseline,  30-day, and 90-day follow  up) to all Telehealth study  
participants.  For the ED study,  provider  participants  will complete  study  procedures  via interview  with  the researcher (on 
paper  or online  if they  prefer)  at post  treatment  for all patients  they  treat  as part of this study.  Measures  for patient

Page  13 of 24 
Version 3 | October 2, 2020   participants  will include  demographics,  questions  about  suicidality,  depressive  symptoms,  use of acute  crisis  tolerance  
skills,  copi[INVESTIGATOR_500617],  and satisfaction  with  ED experience. Measures  for provider  particip ants  will include  
demographics, questions  about  preparedness  for clinical  interview,  patient  distress,  provider  confidence  in suicide  risk 
assessment,  and helpfulness  of Jaspr.  Semi -structured  interviews  will be conducted  with  patient  participants  at each  time  
point after  baseline  to obtain  feedback  about  the participant’s  experien ce in the ED, experience  with suicide      
symptoms, and/or  Jaspr  tools  and features.  For the Telehealth study, measures  for patient participants  include  
demographics, questions  about  suicidality,  depressive  and anxiety  symptoms,  stress,  copi[INVESTIGATOR_500617],  
satisfaction with  outpatient  care  and JAH.  Semi -structured interviews  at each  follow -up assessment  will be conducted to  
obtain  feedback  about  the participant’s  experience  with suicide  and use of their  resources  since  the prior  study  session.  
 
Data  will be entered  online  using an encrypted,  secure  online  assessment  tool such  as SurveyMonkey.  Missing values  are 
coded as  to reason  missing  (e.g.,  ‘participant  unable  to be located,’  ‘participant  refused  to answer,’  etc.).  All data will be 
cleaned  for logic  and other  types  of errors  using SPSS.  With  regards  to dropouts  and missing data,  we plan to gather  data  
for all participants  at all time  points,  including from  those  who  stop using Jaspr  or JAH.  This will allow  us to conduct  
primary  analyses  on the intent -to-treat  sample. To minimize  missing data,  we have  included  built -in incentives  (i.e.,  
bonus  payments  for completing all assessments)  and training by  [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Kate  Comtois  in methods  to decrease  attrition. To 
the extent  that there  is question about  skipped  or missed  assessments,  the software  and analysis  method we  have  
chosen  provides  options  for the handling of incomplete  data.  Preference  will be given to those  methods  for which  the 
assumptions  (e.g.,  Missing  at Random)  are plausibly  met and that have  the least  biased parameters.  
 
Analysis  Strategy.  We will use SPSS  Version  23. For patient  data,  we will use Hierarchical Linear  Modeling (HLM).  HLM  
provides  greater  flexibility  in that it  can analyze  a variety of commonly  encountered  outcome  distributions  (e.g.,  
continuous,  binary  count),  test the fit of different  covariance  matrix  assumptions;  and include  participants  who are 
missing data  at some  time  points.  We will account  for nesting of patients  under  providers  by [CONTACT_500678] a 
random effect; we will account  for nesting within sites  by [CONTACT_500679].  For each outcome,  we will specify  the correct  distribution and compare  fit indices  to identify  the 
covariance  matrix  best  fitting  the data.  Many  hypotheses  relate to change  over  time,  and so the multiple  time -points  will 
be treated as nested  within  the individual. Also,  we will treat  the intervention conditions  (Jaspr and JAH)  and time  as 
categorical,  dummy -coded  predictors;  the control  conditions  and baseline  scores  will serve  as the reference  category.  
The parameter  of interest  will be the Time  X Condition interaction,  and the Type  III statistic  will serve  as an omnibus  test 
of whether  the two conditions  differed  in change  over  time.  Regression coefficients  will indicate  at which  follow  up time  
points  the conditions  showed  differential  change  from baseline.  For patient  satisfaction as  well as the secondary  
hypotheses  concerning medical providers  ratings  of helpfulness,  we will compute  descriptive  statistics  and consider  
ratings  to be favorable  using  the a priori established  criteria that  80%  or more  respondents  rate program  components  as 
favorable  or highly  favorable. For  the remaining  secondary  hypotheses,  which  are based  on provider  data  about  
patients  from  both  conditions  at one time  point,  we will compute  between -condition  means.  Since  it is possible  that 
not all providers  will be able  to provide  data  given  time  constraints  inherent  in their  job, we may  not have  the statistical  
power  to conduct  probability  tests.  Hence,  we will examine  the data  descriptively  to provide  preliminary  information 
about  efficacy  and compute  effect  sizes  to inform  future  research.  
 
Statistical  Power Considerations.  For Hypotheses  [ADDRESS_644696],  the Time  X Condition interaction.  Power  analyses  assumed  equal  
size groups,  p ≤ .05, power  of .80, and two-tailed  tests.  Using GPower’s  utility for the General  Linear  Model,  we found  
that a  total  sample  size of [ADDRESS_644697]  (f > = 25). However,  this assumes  no  
design effects  (DE)  that occur  due to the nesting  of patients  under  physicians.  In the likely  event  that design  effects  exist,  
a sample  of [ADDRESS_644698]  with DEs as great  as 3.0).  Adjusting  this 
number  for possible  20%  attrition,  we would need  to enroll  at least  [ADDRESS_644699]  sufficient  statistical  power  for all outcome  variables.

Version 3 | October 2, [ADDRESS_644701] (DSMB).  Relying on [CONTACT_500704]’  (CAMS  Treatment  
Developer)  familiarity  with  the top clinicians  and researchers  within the  field,  we selected  Gregory  Brown,  PhD,  as the 
chair  of our DSMB.  [CONTACT_46792]  currently  serves  as a Research  Associate  Professor  at of  Clinical  Psychology  and Psychiatry  
at the  University  of Pennsylvania,  where  his research efforts  focus  on developi[INVESTIGATOR_007],  evaluating,  and disseminating  
interventions  for individuals  at high risk for suicide.  Jeffrey  Sung,  MD has agreed  to serve  in the  role as our DSMB  ED 
Psychiatrist.  [CONTACT_213237] has  experience  in the  clinical treatment  of suicidal  patients  and has  also focused  on training in 
suicide  risk assessment,  management,  and treatment.  Our third  DSMB  member  is Craig Bryan,  PsyD.  [CONTACT_220098] is a 
board -certified  clinical psychologist  and current  Executive Director  of the National  Center  for Veterans  Studies  at the 
University  of Utah. [CONTACT_220098] has  a lengthy  history  of successful  treatment  development,  research,  and treatment  of 
suicide.  
 
The specific  goals  of this DSMB  are: 
1. To review  procedures  for maintaining the  confidentiality of data,  and quality of data  collection,  management,  
and analysis.  
2. Provide  consultation  and procedural recommendations  for working with  suicidal  patients  when  necessary.  
3. Review  progress  toward  meeting enrollme nt goals.  
4. When  appropriate,  serve  as final  arbiters  of whether  a participant  should be  removed  from the protocol.  
5. To recommend  continuation,  discontinuation,  modification,  or termination  of a study  based  on emerging data  
(in the  study  and/or  literature)  and evaluation of risk/benefit ratio.  
 
Given  the nature  of this project,  we expect  the likelihood  of items  [ADDRESS_644702]’s  criteria  for an immediately  reportable  
severe  adverse  event  (SAE)  will be established  and subsequent reporting  will follow  this guideline.  The study  will use the 
procedures  of the NIMH  Data  Safety  Monitoring Board to determine  triggers  for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_500630].  As per NIMH  DSMB  
procedure,  the raw numbers  of suicidal  events  and level  of suicidal  ideation will  be provided  in the DSMB  reports  to 
allow  the DSMB  to determine  if stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_500631].  We will also send  recruitment progress  
updates,  participation  rates,  a detailed  summary  of all potentially  adverse  events,  as well as a summary  of those  
situations  that may  not meet  the thresh old of a potentially  adverse  event but  that nonetheless  may  be important  for the 
DSMB  to consider  in advance  of their  scheduled  meetings.  In the event  that a SAE occurs  (e.g.,  suicide,  homicide,  
physical  attack  on staff,  indication  of clinical worsening),  the PI [INVESTIGATOR_500632]  24 hours  of learning  
of the event. All  suicide  attempts  and emergency  department  are also reported  in the  annual  IRB and DSMB  reports.  In 
trials  of acutely  suicidal  participants,  suicide  attempts  and emergency  department are  classified  as expected  events  and 
immediate  reporting is required  only  when  clinical  worsening is indicated (e.g.,  a suicide  attempt  in a patient  who  has 
not done  so before).  
 
Following  each  meeting  of the DSMB,  the DSMB  Chair  will prepare  and send a brief  summary  report  to the PI. The  report  
will document  that:  (1) a review  of recruitment, data, and outcomes  has occurred;  (2) the number,  nature,  and outcome  
of any  adverse  events  occurring during the  review  period;  and (3) reflect  the date  the review  took  place.  The report  will 
also inform  the PIs of the board’s  conclusion with  respect  to study  progress,  any need for modification  of the study

Version 3 | October 2, [ADDRESS_644704]. Dimeff  will be responsible  for managing,  storing,  and protecting data  at the primary study  research site.  She will work  
closely  with  the research staff  to maintain  continuous,  close  monitoring  and promptly  report  adverse  events  to the      
site PIs, the DSMB,  and the IRB.  The study  coordinators  (i.e.,  EBPI  [CONTACT_218994], site PIs, site RAs)  will notify  [CONTACT_412896]  of any 
adverse  events  within  [ADDRESS_644705]  
protected  area  within  a cloud -based  encrypted  server  (Box)4 that is accessible  only  to the research  team.  The data  files 
are coded  with  the participant’s  study  identification number  and time  point.  The files  do not  contain identifying  
information  such  as the participants’  names , but will again  contain  the particip ant’s  study  identification number.  Survey - 
based  data,  including the  screening and demographics  questionnaire,  as well as a brief  questionnaire  to assess  
acceptability  and clinical relevance,  are also stored in SurveyMonkey,  where  responses are transmitted  using  a Secure  
Sockets  Layer  (SSL)  connection and is also encrypted.[ADDRESS_644706]  cases,  participants  will complete  the surveys  directly  in SurveyMonkey and/or  the data  are entered  directly  by 
[CONTACT_500680].  In the rare event  that a participant  prefers  to complete  a paper -pencil  measure,  the data  
will be immediately  entered into SurveyMonkey  by a study  RA then the  paper  copy  will be destroyed  within  [ADDRESS_644707] participants from loss of confidentiality, the following procedures will be employed: Each participant will be 
assigned a study identification number that does not contain number elements that could be linked back to their 
identity. Only one document, known as the Master Participant Document (MPD), will link the patient’s identity  to their 
study identification number. The MPD file is password protected and stored separate from study data on a cloud -based 
encrypted server (Dropbox)[ADDRESS_644708] of human subjects’ 
research. No o ther data is included in the MPD. Out of an abundance of caution and to ensure HIPAA protections, all 
electronic files that include patient names or other identifying information (even though not associated with the 
patient’s study ID), will be stored on D ropbox. EBPI [INVESTIGATOR_16884] a BAA in place with Dropbox and only assigned researchers (e.g., 
PI, Research Assistants) will have access to EBPI’s Dropbox account.  
 
When  applicable  (e.g.,  follow  up assessments)  study  staff  will send  email and/or  text reminders  to parti cipants  
completing  survey measures  online  that includes  a link to the online  survey  questionnaires.  Participants  will enter  their  
unique  study  identification  number  rather  than  identifying information when  completing  survey measures  (online  or via 
paper/pencil).  Data  gathered  via online  surveys  will be securely  transmitted  and stored  according to  the site’s  security  
policy,  accessible  only  to the PIs and research  staff  via a password -secured  account.  
 
Data  will be protected  and stored  as described  above  in Storage  of Data.  In addition,  we will destroy  all files that have  
any names  or other  identifying information five  years  after  the study  is finished,  including the  file that links  participant  
names  to study  IDs. 
 
Information provided  to Boys  Town  counselors,  when  applicable,  will be sent  via secure  email transfer  using Microsoft

Version 3 | October 2, 2020   365 Message  Encryption  that is built  on the Azure  Information  Protection  platform.  Emails  will be sent  directly  to a 
dedicated Boys  Town  email  address.  All identifying information  will be destroyed  after  the call  and reports  provided  by 
[CONTACT_500681] [INVESTIGATOR_500633].  Boys  Town  will use the patients  study  
ID instead  of their  name [CONTACT_29097],  such as initials.  
 
6. Risk/Benefit  Assessment  
 
A. Risks  
 
The risk to participants  in this research  is minimal  when  applying NIMH risk  standards  and designations.7 According to  
these NIMH guidelines,  “minimal  risk to subjects  means  that the probability and  magnitude  of harm  or discomfort  
anticipated  in the research  are not greater than those  ordinarily  encountered  in daily  life or during  the performance  of 
routine  physical  and psychological  examinations  or tests  and that  confidentiality  is adequately  protected. This  category  
includes  protocols  that pose  “no greater  than  minimal  risk”  according  to federal  regulations. ” 
 
This study  includes  patients  and health care  provider  participants.  Not all potential study  risks  listed  here  will be  relevant  
for all participants.  
 
This study  seeks  to include  patients  currently  acutely  suicidal  and/or  recently  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_500634].  By 
[CONTACT_108],  these  patients  are inherently  high -risk participa nts; however,  the question to  consider  for this research is 
whether  the study  procedures,  including the  clinical intervention,  is likely  to make  the participants  more  suicidal. We 
believe  the answer  is no. Some  patient participants  may  feel distressed  while  completing  study  procedures  and survey  
measures  because  of the content,  which includes  questions  about  suicidality,  use of acute  crisis  tolerance  skills,  and 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_500617].  Some  patient participants  may  find these  questions  distressing as they  could remind them of 
the reason for  their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  On the other hand,  the assessments  could potentially  be helpful  to the patient  
participants  as they  reflect  over  their  recent  experiences  and view  the bigger  pi[INVESTIGATOR_500635]. Even  with  this 
sensitive  population,  we believe  the risk to be low,  particularly  because  the Site Contact  [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a designee  or outpatient  
provider will determine  who  is sufficiently  stable  to engage  in the research  and will rule  out those  who  are considered 
to be at considerable  psychotic  and/or  so agitated  that engagement  in the  study  could cause  harm.  Nevertheless,  this 
concern  will be first and foremost  in our minds  as we implement  the study  procedures,  and in our discussions  with  our 
suicide  expert  advisors  and DSMB  members.  
 
Physical,  social,  economic,  or legal  risks  from  participating for patients  and providers  are expected  to be low to non- 
existent.  However,  it is conceivable  that a data  breach  could  lead to  work/insurance  discrimination  based  on a patient’s  
history  of suicidal  behavior.  
 
Other  potential  study  risks  include:  
• discomfort  sharing personal  experiences  and opi[INVESTIGATOR_6153]  
• discomfort  providing negative  feedback  on the tool or responding to  questionnaires  
• feeling pressure  to participate  because  they  are being referred  to the study  by [CONTACT_500682]  (in the 
case  of patients)  or their supervisor  (in the case  of professional  participants)  
• impact  on treatment  
• data  charges  
• There  is also the potential risk of loss of confidentiality  
 
There  are no known  alternative  procedures  to assess  this information.  The primary  alternative  to participating in the  
Evidence-Based Practice Institute | [ADDRESS_644710] SW, Seattle WA [ZIP_CODE] | [PHONE_10384] | [EMAIL_9537]  
Page  17 of 24 
Version 3 | October 2, [ADDRESS_644711]  not to participate  in the research,  which  participants  may  do at any time  without  change  to any 
current  or future  medical  care,  benefits,  or employment.  
 
B. Prevention  of Risks  
 
The primary  focus  of this summative  evaluation will  be to gather  qualitative  and quantitative  data  regarding the  patient  
participant’s  suicidality,  use of copi[INVESTIGATOR_500636],  ED or outpatient  experience,  and feedback  
about  the app (in the case  of patients  in the Jaspr  [ED study]  or JAH [Telehealth study]  conditions).  To address  potential  
discomfort  in sharing  personal  experiences,  opi[INVESTIGATOR_6153],  and criticism  about  the app and/or  negative  experiences  during  
the follow  up interviews  and surveys,  the interviewer  will assure  the participant  that any and all feedback  is helpful  and 
that they may  choose  how  much  or little  they wish to share. For  the ED study, the baseline  assessment  with  patient  
participants  will occur  in the ED in where medical  and clinical staff  are available  to provide  assistance  in the unlikely  
event  that the patient  becomes  upset  during the  study  procedures.  During in -person testing,  the study  assessment  will 
take  place  in a quiet,  private  room  provided  by [CONTACT_5035][INVESTIGATOR_500637]’s  private  ED room.  All follow  up 
assessments  (and  baseline assessment  for the Telehealth study)  will be conducted remotely  via phone  and internet,  and 
the participant  will be advised  to schedule  the call at a time  when  they  can be in a private,  quiet  area.  
 
Other  potential  risks  for patient  participants  assigned  to the Jaspr  condition include  the provider’s  overreliance  on Jaspr,  
superseding their  own  independent analysis  and/or  an incomplete  or faulty  imminent distress  brief  intervention,  which  
could  ultimately  cause  harm. Providers  will be encouraged  to use their  own  clinical  judgment  when  deciding how/when  
to incorporate  Jaspr  and the reports  it provides.  Regarding the  patient’s  use of Jaspr -at-Home,  the app  is meant  to be 
used  only  after  discharge  and research  staff  and/or  Boys  Town  crisis  counselors  are available  to support  patients  in any 
way they  need.  
 
All participants  will be provided  with  complete  disclosure  regarding what  explicitly  will be asked  of them  using  an 
Informed  Consent  procedure. The  Informed  Consent  form  will describe  the procedures  of the study  and clarify  that the 
study  is completely  voluntary  and that  they  may  decline  to participate  at any time.  Although potential participants  may  
be informed  of the study  by [CONTACT_40213]  (in the case  of providers),  or their  providers  (in the case  of patients),  it will 
be made  clear  to all potential participants  that the study  is completely  voluntary and will  not affect  their  standing with  
their agency,  provider,  or treatment  (i.e.,  that they  will receive  treatment regardless  of their  participation)  in any way.  
Organizations  and providers  will be informed  that there  should  be no coercion of potential  participants  to take  part in 
the research.  In addition,  we will provide  partnering  organizations  with  detailed  instructions  and scripts  on how  to 
provide  information about  this study  to potential participants.  
 
Should adverse  events  occur  during the  study,  we will thoroughly  assess  factors  that contributed to  the adverse  event,  
including use  of Jaspr  or JAH,  and will seek  resolution  of those  problems  related  to the study.  We will notify  the IRB and 
our DSMB  of adverse  events,  seek  their  recommendations,  modify  the protocol,  and seek IRB approval  for the 
modification.  
 
[CONTACT_412896]  will collaborate  closely  with the IRB and  DSMB  throughout  the study  to ensure  proper  management of high - 
risk situations.  [CONTACT_500701]  will be  consulted for  concurrence  with the plan on imminent -risk situations  as well.  If the 
participant  becomes  distressed  during the  baseline  session,  the study  staff  initiates  a warm  hand  off to a provider  on the 
spot  so that the patient  may  receive  assistance  in mood  improvement  or safety  planning from their clinical  team or  
other  trained  professional.  During follow  up assessments,  if the  participant  sounds  distressed  or indicates  suicidality or 
self-harm  intentions,  the researcher conducting  the follow  up interview  will initiate  a warm  hand  off at the end of the 
interview  to a Boys  Town  counselor  to conduct  risk assessment and provide  resources  as necessary.  Boys  Town  will 
provide  study  staff  with call documentation by [CONTACT_500683] [INVESTIGATOR_500638];  if 
Evidence-Based Practice Institute | [ADDRESS_644712] SW, Seattle WA [ZIP_CODE] | [PHONE_10384] | [EMAIL_9537]  
Page  18 of 24 
Version 3 | October 2, 2020   the DSMB  and/or  IRB need  to be informed.  
 
Steps will be taken to ensure  that participation is voluntary  and that participants’  privacy  and the data collected from  
the participants  are protected.  
 
Protection from  Feeling Discomfort  
The primary  focus  of the summative  studies  is to evaluate  Jaspr  and JAH,  respectively.  To address  potential  discomfort  in 
sharing criticism  during the  study  session,  the interviewer  will assure  the participant  that any and all feedback  is helpful  
and the  main  reason for  conducting  the study.  
 
Protection from  Coercion  
Participants  will be told that  their participation is completely  voluntary,  and that they  may  change  their  minds  and 
withdraw at  any time.  Participants  will be told that  their  choice  to participate  or not will in  no way affect their  
relationship  with their  treatment  providers,  the usual  care they  are eligible  to receive,  and/or  their  colleagues.  
 
Protection from  Potential  Delayed Treatment  
The participants’  medical  care  is the most  important  thing.  Study  procedures  will be paused  if a member  of the care  
team  needs  to talk with  or proceed  with  other  medical  care  with the patient  participant,  and resume  when  the patient  is 
available  again.  
 
Protection from  Potential  Data  Charge  
This is applicable  only  to participants  in the Jaspr  and JAH conditions.  Participants  will be told that they may  choose  to use 
the app at any time  and they may  choose  to use it only  when  on Wi-Fi connection.  They may  also log out of  the app and 
only log back  in when  they  are comfortable  doing so. We will also recommend  checking  with their  smartphone  data  
provider  to ensure  they  know  how  much  data  they may  use each  billing period  without  incurring extra  charges.  
 
Protection from  Loss  of Confidentiality  
Data  will be protected  and stored  as described  above  in Protection  of Study  Data.  In addition,  we will destroy  all files 
that have  any names  or other  identifying information five  years  after  the study  is finished, including the  file that links  
participant  names  to study  IDs. 
 
C. Adverse  Events  
 
For this study,  we define  an adverse  event  as any untoward  or unfavorable  occurrence,  including  significant  increases  in 
distress during the  study  interview,  or symptom  associated with  the participant ’s participation in the research,  whether  
or not considered  related  to their  participation in the  research .8 Serious  adverse  events  include  suicide  attempt,  non- 
suicidal  self-injury,  significant  increase  in suicidal  ideation,  and/or  significant  increase  in agitation  while  participating in 
the study,  as reported by  [CONTACT_2299],  or observed  and/or  reported by [CONTACT_500684],  and/or  a member  of 
the research  team.  Given  the minimal  risk nature  of this study,  likely  causes  of such  adverse  events  may  include  one or 
more  of the following  factors:  frustration  with  the extensive  length  of stay  in the ED (frequently  considerably  longer  than  
the usual  length  of stay for patients  with  a medical  crisis); nicotine  withdraw  caused  from  long  lengths  of stay in   
patients  addicted  to nicotine;  and dissatisfaction  with  the care  they  are receiving while  in the ED or with the discharge  
disposition  provided  by [CONTACT_500685].  
 
Should adverse  events  occur  during the  study,  we will thoroughly  assess  factors  that contributed to  the adverse  event,  
including use  of Jaspr  or JAH,  and will seek  resolution  of those  problems  related  to the study.  Regardless  of the cause  of 
the adverse  event,  we will notify  the IRB and our DSMB  of adverse  events  within  10 business  days,  should they occur,  
and seek  their  recommendations.  Fatal  or life-threatening events,  should  they occur,  will be reported  to the IRB 
Evidence-Based Practice Institute | [ADDRESS_644713] SW, Seattle WA [ZIP_CODE] | [PHONE_10384] | [EMAIL_9537]  
Page  19 of 24 
Version 3 | October 2, [ADDRESS_644714]. Dimeff  of any  adverse  events  within  24 hours  of occurring and 
notification  will be forwarded  to the  DSMB  and IRB within ten business  days;  fatal  or life-threatening events  will be 
reported  to [CONTACT_412896]  immediately  and she  will notify  the IRB and  DSMB  right  away.  
 
D. Benefits  
 
There  are no direct  benefits  from  participating in this study;  however,  there  are several  indirect  benefits  for 
participation.  Some  participants  may  feel personal  reward  by [CONTACT_500686].  Findings  from this  study  will be 
used  to develop a product  that is intended  to increase  quality of care  for patients  who recently  made  a suicide  attempt  
or are  struggling with  suicidal  ideation.  Participants  directly  interacting  with  Jaspr  may  benefit  from  perceived  improved  
care as  a result  of their  direct  interaction and their  provider’s  interaction  with the tools.  Provider  participants  may  
benefit from  using Jaspr  while  providing risk assessments  and management  while  also learning CAMS. Providers  may  
also experience  less distress  when  assessing, treating,  and deciding disposition for  their  suicidal  patients.  We believe  
the potential  benefits  to science  and standard  of care  for suicidal  patients  outweigh the  risks  associated  with 
participation in this research.  
 
The proposed  research contributes  to the goal of improving quality  of care  for suicidal  patients,  particularly  in EDs where  
there is  often a lack of sufficient  time  and mental health  resources.  Developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a successful and efficient  relational  agent  
based  on the CAMS  approach  means that suicidal  patients  will receive  evidence -based  assessment and treatment  
delivered  in a more  timely,  effective,  and efficient  manner  than  is typi[INVESTIGATOR_500639].  
 
7. Participant  Recruitment  and Informed  Consent  
 
A. Recruiting  
 
Suicidal  patients  and their  providers  will be recruited  from  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]/organizations  nationwide.  Interested  providers  
from  each  site will  be recruited and enrolled  on a first-come,  first-served  basis.  Patient  participants  will similarly  be 
recruited  on a first-come,  first-served  basis.  
 
ED Study : Each  designated  project  site that has agreed  to participate  will designate  a person  within  the ED to serve  as  
our “site contact” when conducting  research  with patient  participants.  We will specifically  coordinate  who  the onsite  
contact  [CONTACT_500687]. Because  our 
access  is linked  to the onsite contact’s  authority  and oversight  of the ED, our intention is to ensure  we proceed  in a way 
that is consistent  with their  preferred  approach.  In the case  where  the site contact  [CONTACT_500688]  (according to usual  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_500640])  suicidal  patients  about

Page  20 of 24 
Version 3 | October 2, [ADDRESS_644716]  at their site for patients  who  are in  the ED because  of 
suicidal  behaviors  and to ask the patient  if they  would  be interested  in speaking  with a  member  of the research team to 
find out more.  While  not required,  site contacts  or their  designee may  choose  to also  mention that:  a) the study  is 
completely  voluntary ; they  do not need  to participate;  b) their decision  – whatever  it is – will in  no way affect  
relationship  with their  treatment  team and that they  will receive  care  regardless;  and c) study  involvement  that day may  
include  using an app as part of their  care  or receiving the  care  the provider/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_500641],  completing  a  
brief interview,  and completing  survey measures  online  today  and at three  time  points  over  the next  [ADDRESS_644717]  a member  of the care  team  do so on their  behalf.  
 
Telehealth  Study : Outpatient  individuals  experiencing  suicidality will learn  of the study  from  their  outpatient  provider.  
Interested  individuals  will contact  [CONTACT_500689].  
 
While  all informed  consent  procedures  will be fully  and thoroughly  conducted by [CONTACT_41314]  (e.g.,  orienting  
prospective  participants  to the study  details,  highlighting that  they  are under  no obligation  to participate  in the study,  
and that  a decision  to decline  participation will  not affect  the fact that they  will receive  treatment; the research  will be 
paused  whenever  necessary  so as not to interfere  with the  patient’s  medical  treatment),  the onsite  contact  [CONTACT_500690].  Onsite  contacts  will be 
knowled geable  about  the study’s  inclusion/exclusion criteria  only  to the degree  that they  can help  identify  which  
patients  to speak  with about  the study.  They will not be expected  to formally  screen the  patient  for study  eligibility;  this 
will instead be performed  by a researcher  prior  to commencing with  the informed  consent procedures.  
 
In the event  that the site contact  [CONTACT_500691]  a prospective  patient,  the onsite  
contact  [CONTACT_500692]/exclusion  criteria  and/or  other  ED or outpatient  policies  and procedures.  For example,  it may  involve  looking at 
the status  on a patient whiteboard and/or  asking  the charge  nurse  if the suicidal  patient  is sufficiently  stable  to talk about  
the study.  
 
ED Study  only: Once  a prospective  patient  participant  is identified,  before  proceeding further,  if the  patient  isn’t  already  
in a private  room,  the researchers  will proceed  with the patient  to a private  area  designated by [CONTACT_500693].  The 
researchers  will enter  the private  room with the patient,  introduce  him/herself,  and request  permission  to describe  
briefly  the study  using the  following  script  or a close  proximity  that allows  for natural conversation  with the patient:  
“Hello. My name  [CONTACT_832] <name>.  I am a  researcher  here  at <site name>.  I know  you’re  going through a lot  right  now  but I’m 
wondering if it would be  okay  to talk  to you about  a research  study  we have going  on right  now  and see if you might   
want  to take part in it? If not, that’s  absolutely  fine.”  (Intention is to get verbal  permission to  proceed).  If patient  
indicates  a preference  to not speak  with the researchers,  then  the researchers  will simply  say: “That  is of course totally  
fine.  Should you change  your  mind  while  you’re  here,  just let the staff  know  and I’ll  come  back.” If the  patient  indicates  
interest  in learning  more  about  the study,  then  the researchers will thank  the patient  and proceed  to eligibility  screening  
and (if eligible)  the Informed Consent  process.  In consultation  with the site PI, treatment  providers  of patient   
participants  will be recruited from  each  participating ED.  When  possible  the study  PI ([CONTACT_412896])  or her designee  will 
conduct  an informational  meeting about  the study  (conducted informally  or during  grand rounds  or brown  bag lunch  
sessions  while  onsite)  for the purposes  of orienting potential  provider  participants  to the study  and participation.  Given  
the minimal  risk nature  of their  engagement in this research and for  efficiency,  informed  consent  will be reviewed  in this 
group format  and questions  will be addressed.  Providers  may  opt to provide  their  consent at that time,  or opt to 
complete  the consent  online  at a later  date  (i.e., not  during  a group context).  Providers  may  choose  to contact  [CONTACT_500694]-Based Practice Institute | [ADDRESS_644718] SW, Seattle WA [ZIP_CODE] | [PHONE_10384] | [EMAIL_9537]

Version 3 | October 2, 2020   research  team  at a later  time  to ask questions  individually,  learn  more  about  the study,  and/or  provide  consent  at that 
later  time.  In all cases,  researchers  will connect via phone/email  or in-person with  the prospective  provider  participants  
and provide  a high -level  overview  of the study.  
 
Although potential participants  may  be informed  of the study  by [CONTACT_500695]  (in the  case  of patients)  or their  
supervisor  (in the case  of providers), it will be made  clear to all participants  that the study  is completely  voluntary  and 
will not  affect  their  employment  or treatment services.  Partnering agencies  and providers  will be informed  that there  
should  be no coercion  of potential  participants  to take  part in the study.  
 
B. Informed  Consent  
 
Patients  and providers who are interested  in participating  will complete  a screen for  eligibility.  As part of the screening  
process,  the potential participants  will also answer  demographic  questions  to assess  whether  our recruitment  effor ts are 
reaching a diverse  group and to assess  the characteristics  of participants  in the  research.  Eligible  participants  will then  
proceed  to the Informed  Consent  procedure  with  a researcher, though participants  may  choose  to review  the consent  
form  on their  own  if they  prefer.  All participants  will be provided  with  an overview of the study  and disclosure  regarding 
what  will be asked  of them  using  Informed  Consent procedures. The  Informed  Consent form  will describe  the study  
procedures  and clarify  that the study  is completely  voluntary  and that  participants  may  decline  to participate  at any 
time.  For the ED study,  the information  provided  to patients  about  Jaspr  will be limited  until  after  randomization to  
guard  against  disappointment  or other  negative  feeling if assigned  to the CAU  condition.  Once  randomized, patients  
assigned  to the Jaspr  condition  will be provided  with  the supplemental consent  form with complete  disclosure  of the 
study  procedures  and information about  Jaspr. These  patient  participants  will have  the chance  to ask questions  about  
Jaspr  and the Jaspr  study  condition  and decide if they want  to continue  their participation in the study.  Once  initial  
eligibility  is determined, potential  participants  will be given  a brief descript ion of the study  and asked  for their  verbal  
consent to  proceed  with  the Informed  Consent discussion.  The Informed  Consent  process  will take  place  in person  with 
a member  of the research  team.   The Informed  Consent  process  will take  place  remotely  via telephone  and/or  internet  
with a  member  of the research  team.  
 
All potential  participants  are informed  during the Informed  Consent  procedure  that participation is completely  voluntary  
and that  they  may  withdraw  from  the study  at any time  with no negative  consequences.  Eligible  participants  will receive  
a copy  of the Informed  Consent  Form  (via hard copy,  or email).  Participants  will have  the opportunity  to read  and review  
the consent  form  with the research  staff,  on their  own,  and/or  review  it with friends  and family  if desired.  The 
researchers may  use a high -level  overview  PowerPoint  on their  laptop computer  to verbally  and/or  visually  walk  patients  
through the  informed  consent form  and HIPAA  Authorization  (patients  only). Study  staff  will be available  to answer  any 
questions  or concerns the  participants  may  have prior  to signing and returning the  consent form.  For the ED study,  
patient  participants  assigned  to the  Jaspr  condition  will be walked  through a supplement  consent  form  with  more  
infor mation about  the app, their signature  [CONTACT_500697], and they will  receive  an electronic  or hard  
copy  of the supplement  consent  form  for their  records.  
 
C. Obtaining  and Documenting  Consent  
 
Participants  will provide  consent  by [CONTACT_500696][INVESTIGATOR_500642].  We will provide  a copy  of the Informed  Consent  form,  and supplement  
consent  form  if applicable,  for the participant  to keep  for their  records.  All signed  consent forms  will be stored  in our 
secure  server on Dropbox.  The researchers  will scan  signed  hard copi[INVESTIGATOR_500643];  the paper  copi[INVESTIGATOR_500644].

Version 3 | October 2, [ADDRESS_644720]  the Informed  Consent  process  with suicidal  
ED patient participants,  will present  a brief  PowerPoint  presentation  or video that outlines  the main  points  of the 
Informed  Consent  in smaller  “chunks” of information  in the ED RCT.  We have  worked with  our consultants,  DSMB,  and 
IRB to  ensure  the language  and length  of the consent  form  is appropriate  for this population.  The patient  will have  the 
opportunity  to ask questions  throughout  the process.  
 
E. Costs  to Participants  
There are no costs to participants for taking part in this study.  
 
F. Compensation  to Participants  
 
For the ED study, patient  participants  will be paid  up to  $225  for their participation.  They  will receive  $25 for  completing  
their baseline  assessment  and $50 for each  follow  up study  assessment  they  complete.  Patients  who  complete  all three  
follow  up assessments  will earn  an additional  $50.  There  is no payment  for provider  participants.  For the Telehealth  
study,  patient participants  will be paid  $25 for each  completed  assessment for  a total  of up to $[ADDRESS_644721]  completed.

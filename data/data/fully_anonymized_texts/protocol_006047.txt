Parallel Design Study to Evaluate the Effects of BPN14770 in 
Patients with Early Stage Alzheimer’s Disease   
Study Number:  BPN14770 -CNS -201 
Study Phase:  Phase 2  
Study Objectives:  
 
In subject s with a clini cal diagnosis of early  stage Alzheimer’s disease  (AD)  receiving cholinesterase inhibitor 
therapy:  
• To evaluate the efficacy  of two dose levels (10 mg bid and 25 mg bid) of BPN14770  
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of BPN14770 10 and 25 mg bid 
• To obt ain pharmacokinetic data on BPN14770 in this subject population  
 
Overview of Endpoints   
 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint:   
• Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neurological Status - Delayed Memory Index (RBANS DMI) – 
change from baseline assessed at Week 1 3 
 
Secondary  Efficacy Endpoints  
• RBANS total score  
• Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study  Activ ities of Daily Living Inventory (ADCS -ADL  ) total score  
• Mini -Mental State Exam ( MMSE ) score  
• Clinical Dementia Rating sum of boxes score (CDR -SB) 
• Clinical Global I mpression – Improvement (CGI- I) 
• Composite endpoint based on  AD Composite Score (ADCOMS)  
 
Safety and Tolerability:  The safety variables to be assessed include adverse events; clinical laboratory parameters 
(chemistry, hematology,  lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], urinalysis ); 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs); physical examinations; and vital 
signs (including blood pressure, heart rate, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]).  
 
Pharmacokinetics:  Plasma BPN14770 concentrations will be obtained during the Weeks 1, 4, [ADDRESS_572999] recent dose of study medication.  Pharmacokinetic  (PK)  samples will be 
retained and may also be utilized subsequently for  biomarker assessment.  
 
Biomarkers:  Blood samples will also be obtained for biomarker testing, at Baseline (Day 1) and at Weeks 1, 4, 8 
and 13.  Samples will be frozen and retained with the PK plasma samples and may be utilized subsequently for biomarker assessment.    
 
Study Design:  
This is a Phase [ADDRESS_573000] of a Screening p eriod 
of up to 28 days prior to initial study drug administration, a 13 -week double -blind treatment, and a final follow -up 
visit for safety one week after treatment is concluded.    
Randomization will be stratified based on presence or absence of an ApoE4 allele in the patient’s genetic profile. Within each stratum, subject s will be randomized in a blinded, balanced fashion to receive either BPN14770 10mg 
bid, BPN14770 25 mg bid, or matching placebo.

In this r andomized double -blind, placebo- controlled 3-arm parallel  study, [ADDRESS_573014] s will be randomized (1:1:1) 
to receive one of  the followin g three  treatment s (85 per group), in addition to receiving their ongoing treatment 
with a cholinesterase inhibitor : 
 
• BPN14770 10 mg bid 
• BPN14770 25 mg bid 
• Matching Placebo  
 
All study medications  will be provided as identical- appearing HPMC capsules in HPE  bottles.  Study drug will be 
taken by [CONTACT_1966] (PO) with water  (at least 120 mL = 4 ounces)  in the morning and at night, approximately [ADDRESS_573015] 30 minutes prior to or 1 hour after meals.   
Statistical Analyses:  
Efficacy Analyses  
The prim ary efficacy population will be the intent to treat (ITT) efficacy population, which will include all 
randomized subjects who received at least one dose of treatment and returned for at least one follow -up visit. The 
per protocol (PP) population (randomize d subjects who received at least one dose of treatment and returned for at 
least one follow -up visit with no significant protocol violations) and the completers (CP) population (randomized 
subject s who completed all 13 weeks of treatment with no significant protocol violations ) will be used to evaluate 
the robustness of the ITT results.  
 
Change from baseline will be calculated for the primary and secondary efficacy parameters at each time point and descriptive statistics provided for each time point. Summar y plots of these data will also be provided. For RBANS 
DMI and total score, MMSE score, and ADCS -ADL total score, pairwise differences in change from baseline 
between the treatment groups (10 mg vs 25 mg BPN14770, 10 mg BPN14770 vs Placebo, 25 mg BPN14770 vs Placebo) will be assessed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model that includes baseline as a covariate and factors for week, site and treatment and the interaction term for week and treatment; the pairwise differences will be assessed at each ti me point.  CDR sum of boxes will be analyzed in the same manner .  
 Change from baseline in the other RBANS index scores (immediate memory, visuospatial/constructional, attention, language) will be summarized by [CONTACT_221934], with descriptive statistics provided.  
 The composite endpoint will be based on the AD Composite Score (ADCOMS), a composite clinical outcome for prodromal Alzheimer's disease trial s.
20 The composite endpoint and analysis model will be fully specified in the 
statistical analysis plan.  
 
The efficacy analyses will be performed on the ITT, PP and CP analysis populations.

4.1 Background 
Tetra Discovery Partners , Inc.  is a central nervous system (CNS) biotechnology company that 
uses structure -based drug design to discover negative allosteric modulators (NAMs) of 
phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) subtypes for neurological and psychiatric diseases.   
Since the introduction of cholinesterase inhibitors to address the depletion of acetylcholine in the 
Alzheimer’s brain (1995) and memantine to improve glutamatergic signaling (2003), there have been no new drugs to treat the condition.  Attempts to develop disease -modifying therapi[INVESTIGATOR_449596] .
3,[ADDRESS_573028] has medical and genetic support but so 
far has proved challenging for therapeutic devel opment .  Also of concern is that successful 
disease modifying therapeutics, if they slow Alzheimer’s disease (AD) progression, are unlikely 
to reverse the cognitive impairment caused by [CONTACT_90050].  Thus there is a need for new drugs to 
address cognitive impairment in AD and other dementias, as well as a need to find drugs that 
may help restore cognitive function and improve brain resilience to the damage caused by [CONTACT_22802]. 
Tetra has developed a mechanistically novel class of drugs to address cognitive impairment 
across multiple psychiatric and neurological indications .  These new drugs selectively target 
subtypes of phosphodiesterase type -4D ( PDE4 D).5,6 The PDE4 D enzyme  subtype is a highly 
validated CNS target for improving cognition.7 
BPN14770 is a novel, selective small molecule inhibitor of the PDE4D enzyme, which is 
considered to play a role in modulating the  3’- 5’- cyclic adenosine monophosphate pathway 
(cAMP ) in the brain important for learning and memory.  BPN14770 is in clinical development 
for treating alzheimer’s disease.  This is the fourth  clinical study evaluating its effects in humans; 
the first study was the single  dose escalation study  (BPN14770- CNS -101; clinicaltrials.gov 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), the second was a multiple dose escalation study in healthy volunteers 
(BPN14770- CNS -102; clinicaltrials.gov [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) , and the third study was single -dose, 6-
period crossover study in healthy volunteers to evaluate the effects of BPN14770 on scopolamine-induced cognitive impairment (BPN14770- CNS -103; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). 
4.[ADDRESS_573029] received BPN14770 either as a single dose 
or as a mult iple dose regimen.  Of these subjects, 106 (78%) were ≤  55 years of age and 30 
(22%) were ≥60 years of age.  
The single dose escalation study ( -101) in 24 subjects ≤  55years of age determined that  a single  
100mg dose was the maximum tolerated dose of BPN14770, based on the occurrence of nausea 
and vomiting in the majority of subjects at this dose.  There were no notable adverse events in other body systems, no observed changes in vital signs  or electrocardiogram, no adverse 
laboratory findings, and no serious adverse events  were recorded .  The multiple dose escalation 
study assesse d 15 mg, 30 mg, and 50 mg doses given BID to 18 subjects ≤45 years of age and 
doses of 10 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg given BID to  30 subjects  ≥ 60 years of age.  All of these 
doses were well tolerated.  An additional cohort of  6 subjects ≤45 years of age received 75mg 
Protocol:  BPN14770- CNS -201 Tetra Discovery Partners, Inc.  
Date: [ADDRESS_573030] one of the two doses of BPN14770; one subject withdrew from the crossover study prior to a dosing cohort containing BPN14770.   
In the dose escalation study ( -102), t here was evidence of greater than proportional increases in 
BPN14770 exposure after a single dose or repeated dosing. Drug accumulation was 
approximately 2 -fold after QD dosing. After  BID dosing, moderate drug accumulation of 
approximately 3 - to 5- fold was observed. Steady state appeared to be reached within 2 to 4 days 
of BID or QD dosing. When adjusted for differences in dose, mean BPN14770 exposure appeared to be similar between healthy young and healthy elderly subjects.  
In the multiple ascending dose study ( -102), BPN14770 administered twice daily to healthy 
elderly subjects was  associated with  improvement in complex attention/working memory, 
delayed recall of verbal information, and delayed recall of visual information (10 and 20 mg doses). No beneficial or detrimental effects were observed on other cognitive tasks  studied. The 
40-mg BID dose was not associated with improvement in any cognitive domain, possibly  
because of a higher frequency of adverse events, primarily headaches,  at this dose level.  
In this initial Phase 2, randomized double -blind, placebo -controlled [ADDRESS_573031] s will be randomized (1:1:1) to receive one of the following three treatments (85 per 
group): BPN14770 [ADDRESS_573032] 3 -fold higher than at the 10 mg dose. The 
objective s of the study are  to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the two doses of BPN [ZIP_CODE], as 
well as to obtain PK data to correlate with cognitive and safety outcomes.  This study will assess 
two doses of BPN14770, 10 mg and 25 mg, both administered twice daily. These doses are well below the maximum tolerated single dose of 100 mg determined in the initial single dose study ( -
101), and also are below the maximum twice daily dose of 50 mg that was well tolerated in the multiple dose study  (-102),  and are therefore expected to be safe and well -tolerated in this trial 
in subject s with AD.  Based on accumulation data from the multiple -dose study, the exposure 
difference between the 10 and 25 mg doses should be 4-fold.   
4.3 Risk/Benefit 
4.3.[ADDRESS_573033] -in-class, subtype selective, phosphodiesterase type -4D (PDE4D) -allosteric 
inhibitor . The unique mechanism of action and subtype selectivity distinguishes BPN14770 from 
the two approved PDE4 inhibitors, roflumilast (Daliresp™) and apremilast (Otezla™).  Roflumilast and apremilast are competitive inhibitors that inhibit the PDE4 enzymes by [CONTACT_449613] 3’ - 5’- cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP).  As the 
amino acid sequence of the PDE4 active site is conserved between the four subtypes, roflumilast and apremilast inhibit all subtypes of PDE4 equally strongly.  Both compounds cause emesis in humans and other species, and as a class, PDE4 competitive inhibitors have been found to cause mesen teric vasculopathy in rats, dogs and primates, although this toxicity has not been observed 
in humans.  In contrast, BPN14770 does not bind to the active site of the PDE4 enzyme and does

Date: 24 September 2019  Confidential  
Page 20 of 61 not cause emesis in ferrets, cynomolgous monkeys or marmosets ; furthe rmore, it has not been 
found to cause mesenteric vasculopathy in rats or dogs in toxicological studies of 3 months  
duration.  Thus, BPN14770 presents a unique procognitive and preclinical safety profile.   
Clearance of BPN14770 by [CONTACT_278097], rat, dog and monkey, expressed as hepatic 
extraction ratio (EH), was 16%, 8.2%, 17%, and 12%, respectively.  Qualitative metabolite profiling in human, rat, dog, and monkey hepatocytes showed a single metabolite in human (<1% parent).  BPN14770 was highly bound to plasma proteins in all species tested.  The fraction unbound (free) was 0.5, 0.4, 0.2, and 0.5%, for mouse, rat, dog, and human, respectively.   
BPN14770 is highly bioavailable in rats, mice and dogs (F% = 100), distributes to brain (B/P = 
0.32-0.48), and has a plasma t
½ of 4.[ADDRESS_573034] Recognition (NOR) test at >0.3 
mg/kg by [CONTACT_51275] , as shown by [CONTACT_449614].  BPN14770 maximum 
plasma concentration (C max) at the minimum effective dose (MED) was 160 ng/mL (in plasma) 
and 40 ng/gm (in brain).  Cognitive benefit is maintained after chronic dosing for 7 days.  BPN14770 also has benefit in a mouse model of cholinergic impairment, the scopolamine -
impaired Y -maze (male C57Bl6 mice MED = 1 mg/kg).   
BPN14770 did not affect cardiovascular function in beagle dogs at doses up to 100 mg/kg, nor did the compound affect respi[INVESTIGATOR_449597] 60 mg/kg.  In the in vitro human Ether -à-go-go-Related Gene (hERG) assay, an increase in 
current of 12% and 33% was seen at concentrations of 10 and 30 µM, respectively.  No IC
50 
could be calculated due to this minor increase in current.  
In rat toxicology studies of 28-days and 13-weeks, BPN14770 was well tolerated up to 60 mg/kg with no deaths on study, and no adverse hematology, clinical chemistry, liver weight or gross necropsy findings. There were no microscopic findings. Unlike the PDE4 inhibitors roflumilast and apremilast, BPN14770 did not cause mesenteric vasculopathy at the doses studied.   
In dog toxicology studies of 28-days and 13- weeks, the no observed adverse effect level 
(NOAE L) for BPN14770 was 30 mg/kg. At 100 mg/kg in the 28-day study, BPN14770 caused 
inappetance and weight loss and in female dogs an approximately 30 msec increase in QTc with 
a concomitant increase in heart rate of 10 bpm. There were no changes in hematology  or 
ophthalmology. Macroscopic observations included pale livers in two of eight animals at 100 mg/kg which correlated with mild alanine transaminase (ALT) elevation only in those two animals. Microscopic changes of periportal hepatocellular cytoplasmic vacuolation were observed in the livers of one male and two female dogs at 100 mg/kg. No liver changes were observed in recovery dogs suggesting that these changes, if present, were reversible.

[IP_ADDRESS] BPN14770- CNS -[ADDRESS_573035]-in-human (FIH), single ascending dose (SAD) trial (BPN14770- CNS -101) in 24 healthy 
subjects  at doses ranging from 5 mg to 100 mg has been completed. The results from this study 
indicate single doses of BPN14770, in the range of 5 mg to 100 mg, were safe and generally well 
tolerated.  The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was determined to be [ADDRESS_573036] commonly reported treatment -emergent, drug- related adverse events were nausea and 
vomiting.  No safety signals were noted in the results of the other safety analyses.  No deaths or other serious adverse events were reported.  No subjects withdrew from the study due to adverse events.  
In the  SAD trial, detectable plasma BPN147 70 concentrations were measured after dosing ( at all 
4 dose levels) starting between 0.[ADDRESS_573037] 48 
hours after dosing.  Drug absorption was variable but moderately rapid with median t ime to 
maximum concent ration  (T
max) values ranging from 1.5 to 3 hours.  The plasma 
pharmacokinetics of BPN14770 after oral administration appeared to be linear for single doses ranging from 5 to 100 mg; although a slight trend for a greater than proportional increase in exposure was observed in the 100- mg group as compared to the lower dose groups.  The 
apparent terminal elimination half -life of BPN14770 was consistent among dose groups and 
averaged between 11 and 13 hours.  Based on the preclinical models, the concentrations 
associated with doses as low as 15 mg were potentially adequate to produce cognitive 
improvement after once - or twice - per day dosing. 
[IP_ADDRESS] BPN14770- CNS -102 
In the multiple ascending dose (MAD) trial  (BPN14770- CNS -102), 76 healthy  young and elderly 
subjects were administered multiple doses of BPN14770 twice daily (every 12 hours) for 8 days.  
Young subjects ( ≤45 years; n=18 treated, 7 placebo)  received twice -daily doses of 15 mg, 30 mg, 
50 mg or placebo for 8 days.  Elderly subjects  (≥60 years; n=30 treated, 15 placebo)  received 
twice -daily doses of 10 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg for 8 days. Twice -daily dosing was selected to 
ensure adequate BPN14770 levels in the brain and plasma throughout the day and night.  An additional cohort of 6 young subjects received a once -daily dose of 75 mg for 8 days  to obtain 
additional safety and  pharmacokinetic ( PK) data at a dose level close to the  MTD  determined in 
the SAD study .   
No deaths or serious adverse events were reported , and no subjects in either the young or elderly 
cohorts withdrew from the study due to adverse events.  A ll treatment- emergent adverse events 
resolved without sequelae by [CONTACT_6591]-up visit.  
All study -drug related adverse events that occurred in more than [ADDRESS_573038] were in the 75-
mg QD dose group and consisted of nausea (reported by 4 of 6 subjects, vomiting (reported by 2 of 6 subjects who also experienced nausea), and decreased appetite (reported by 3 of 6 subjects). Across the young subject cohorts, all but 2 of the reported adverse events were mild i n severity; 
moderate nausea and vomiting were reported in 1 of 6 subjects (16.7%) in the 75- mg QD dose

Date: [ADDRESS_573039] dose groups, no clinically significant effects of 
multiple oral doses of BPN14770 (15 mg, 30 mg, 50 mg, or 75 mg) were observed on biochemistry, 
hematology, or urinaly sis; vital signs; or ECGs.  
 
Among the elderly subject cohorts, the percentage of subjects who experienced at least one 
treatment- emergent adverse event was similar between the 10 -mg BID, 20-mg BID, and placebo 
groups (ranging from 30% to 50%) and was higher for the 40-mg BID dose group (90%). Likewise, 
the percentage of subjects with at least one drug-related adverse event was also higher for the 40-mg BID dose group (70%) compared with the 10-mg BID dose group (40%), the 20-mg BID dose group (20%), and the placebo group (26.7%).  Adverse events reported in 2 or more elderly subjects within 
a dose group were all reported by [CONTACT_262093] 40-mg dose group and consisted of diarrhea, 
increased alanine and aspartate aminotransferase, hot flush (each reported at a frequency rate of 20%) and headache (reported at a frequency rate of 40%).  Across the elderly subject cohorts, 2 adverse events (dizziness and hypotension) of moderate severity were reported in 1 of the 10 subjects (10.0%) in the 10 mg BID dose group, and 1 headache of moderate severity was reported in 1 of 10 
subjects (10.0%) in the 40-mg BID dose group.  Among the elderly subject dose groups, no clinically 
significant effects of multiple oral doses of BPN14770 (10 mg, 20 mg, or 40 mg) were observed on biochemistry, hematology, or urinalysis; vital signs; or ECGs.   
With respect to cognitive testing,  BPN14770 10 mg given twice daily was associated with 
improvement in complex attention/working memory and delayed recall of both visual and verbal 
information. Treatment with BPN14770 20 mg twice daily was associated with similar benefits as the 10 mg twic e daily regimen, excluding improvement in delayed recall of visual information. Neither 
the 10- or 20-mg BID regimens was  associated with improvement in psychomotor function, visual, 
or verbal learning, or executive function. The 40-mg BID regimen was not associated with improvement in any cognitive domain.   Pharmacokinetic analyses found that steady-state appeared to be reached after 3 to 4 days of BID or QD dosing in both young and elderly subjects. After a single oral dose of BPN14770 in healthy 
young s ubjects, C
max and AUC 12 appeared to increase in a dose-proportional fashion over the dose 
range of 15 to 50 mg, with a greater than proportional increase in exposure observed after a 75- mg 
dose. Following BID dosing of BPN14770 in healthy young subjects, C max and AUC 12 appeared to 
increase in a greater than dose-proportional fashion from 15 mg to either 30 mg or 50 mg. A 
moderate degree of accumulation (up to approximately 5-fold) was observed after BID dosing in 
healthy young subjects, with less accumulation (approximately 2-fold) after QD dosing.  
 
After a single oral dose of BPN14770 in healthy elderly subjects, C max appeared to increase in a 
greater than dose-proportional fashion over the dose range of 10 to 40 mg, whereas AUC 12 appeared 
to increase in a greater than dose-proportional fashion from 10 mg or 20 mg to 40 mg. Following 
BID dosing of BPN14770 in healthy elderly subjects, C max and AUC 12 appeared to increase in a 
greater than dose-proportional fashion over the dose range of 10 to 40 mg. A modera te degree of 
accumulation (up to approximately 4-fold) was observed after BID dosing in healthy elderly subjects.  
 
In healthy young subjects, mean peak to trough fluctuation was similar among BID regimens, 
ranging from 171% to 179%, and was 337% for the QD regimen.  In healthy elderly subjects, mean 
peak to trough fluctuation was similar among BID regimens, ranging from 156% to 249%.

placebo -controlled, 6-period crossover study to evaluate the effects of BPN14770 10 and 50 mg 
in reversing scopolamine-induced cognitive impairment in healthy volunteers. A positive control, 
donepezil 10 mg, was included, and additivity of BPN14770 50 mg to donepezil 10 mg in reversing scopolamine effects was also evaluated. A total of 38 subjects were enrolled into the study. The study duration was up to 12 weeks with 6 weeks of single-dose treatment visits. The study consisted of a screening visit (up to [ADDRESS_573041] study drug administration), 6 
inpatient treatment visits (Periods 1 through 6), and a follow-up/early termination visit ([ADDRESS_573042] dose of study drug). An additional study visit may have been necessary to complete the required cognit ive test familiarization if not completed during the screening visit.

5.2 Dose Selection 
Doses of 10 and 25 mg BPN14770 to be taken twice daily were chosen for testing in this study.   
Based on pharmacokinetic data from study BPN14770- CNS -102 (MAD), steady state average 
plasma concentrations of BPN [ZIP_CODE] 10 mg are projected to be approximately 60 n g/ml. 
Therefore, the lower dose of 10 mg has the potential to demonstrate efficacy in this study, although given the uncertainties of translation from preclinical models, it may be below the effective range.   On the other hand, the 25 mg dose should be above that needed for efficacy, and 
is estimated to produce steady state  with projected average plasma levels of  concentrations over 
200 ng/ml .  The twice -daily doses of [ADDRESS_573046] will be up to 127 days (18 weeks), including a maximum of a 28- day screening  period, 13 weeks of dosing, and a follow-up period ([ADDRESS_573047] dose ).

7.2 Study Medications 
The 10 mg and 25 mg BPN14770 capsules and placebo capsules intended for use in this Phase 2 
clinical trial are manufactured  by [CONTACT_449616], Inc. and will be packaged, labeled, and shipped for 
clinical use to sites by [CONTACT_449617]  (San D iego, CA).   
 The 10 mg and 25 mg BPN14770 capsules are manufactured using a wet granulation process.  The same granulation is used to manufacture both strengths of capsules by [CONTACT_449618]. The appropriate amount of granulation is blended wi th additional excipi[INVESTIGATOR_449599] a homogeneous blend.  The blend is then filled into hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC), size 1, opaque white/opaque white capsules.  The capsules are packaged as  34-count in 
60 cc, white, high- density polyethy lene (HDPE), round bottles with 33 mm, with white 
polypropylene ribbed caps; 12- count bottles are similarly packaged .  Over the course of the 
study, each subject will receive six 34 -count bottles and one 12-count bottle.  The container -
closure system is la beled with a study- specific label and stored at controlled room temperature 
(20ºC – 25ºC) in a secured location (locked) with access restricted to authorized personnel only.  Storage temperature will be monitored and recorded.     BPN14770 placebo capsules are manufactured, packaged, labeled and stored similarly to the active capsules.

the eCRF .  Only changes from baseline physical examination findings that meet the definition of 
a treatment -emergent AE will be recorded as  an AE; any changes occurring between Screening 
and Baseline require an update to medical history . 
8.5 Height, Weight, Body Mass Index   
Body weight and height are to be measured at Screening , and body weight will be repeated at 
Baseline and the Week 13  visit a s specified in  the Schedule of Assessments .  Subjects will wear 
indoor clothing and remove their shoes prior to  the measurements .  Body Mass I ndex (BMI) will 
be calculated and recorded .   
8.6 Vital Signs 
Vital signs ( pulse rate, blood pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], and temperature ) will be measured at 
Screening, during the Treatment Visits, and Follow -Up as specified in the Schedule of 
Assessments. 
Blood pressure and heart rate will be measured using a calibrated, fully automated machine with 
a cuff that is appropriate to the size of the upper arm.  If a fully automated machine is not available, blood pressure may be measured manually.  Blood pressure at the Screening Visit should be obtained in both arms and the arm with the highe r value should be used for ongoing 
monitoring throughout the rest of the study.  For each subject, measurement on the same arm 
(right or left) using the same method (either automated or manual) should occur throughout the 
study .   All blood pressure measurements should be obtained with the subject in the sitting 
position, after the subject is at rest for [ADDRESS_573063] for study participation based on

glucose or lipid testing.   
A central laboratory will be used to analyze the clinical laboratory samples.  
8.9 Management of Abnormal Clinical Laboratory Tests 
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to review the results of all lab tests as they become available 
and to document their review by [CONTACT_449620].  For each lab test outside of the laboratory normal range, the Investigator must ascertain if this is a clinically significant 
change from baseline for the individual subject.  This determination does not necessarily need to be mad e the first time an abnormal lab is observed .  The Investigator may repeat the lab test or 
request additional tests to verify the results of the original lab test.  
All clinically significant laboratory abnormalities occurring during the study that were not 
present at baseline should be reported as AEs, and followed and evaluated with additional tests if necessary until determination  of the underlying cause or adverse event resolution. 
8.10 Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C- SSRS) 
The Columbia Suicide Seve rity Rating Scale (C -SSRS) is a prospective assessment instrument 
that directly classifies suicidal ideation and behavior into 11 preferred categories.8  The C -SSRS 
involves a series of probing questions to inquire about possible suicidal thinking and behavior. 
Protocol:  BPN14770- CNS -201 Tetra Discovery Partners, Inc.  
Date: [ADDRESS_573066] is ineligible for the study if the subjec t scores a suicidal ideation intensity 
of 3 or higher (per the C-SSRS) or has exhibited any suicidal behavior within the past three 
months. 
If a subject scores an intensity of 3 or higher for suicidal ideation (per the C -SSRS)  during the 
Treatment and Fol low-Up Visits a suicide risk assessment must be completed by [CONTACT_093].  
If a subject scores an intensity of [ADDRESS_573067] will be  discontinued from the study and referred  for psychiatri c evaluation.  
8.11 Additional Safety Measures 
Subjects and caregivers will be instructed to inform the study physician and/or research 
personnel of any AEs  that occur at any time during the study.  
 Procedures will be completed as specified in this protocol unle ss contraindicated due to a 
reported AE.  If, in the judgement of the Investigator, additional testing is required to assess an adverse event or otherwise clinically significant event, this testing should be discussed first with the sponsor unless needed urgently.   
8.12 Cognitive Battery 
At Screening, the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neurological Status -Delayed 
Memory Index  (RBANS DMI), Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE), Clinical Dementia Rating 
(CDR), and the Modified Hachinski Ischemia Scale (MHIS) will be used to assess the cognitive status of the subject.  During the Baseline Visit, the subjects will be reassessed on RBANS and MMSE. Caregivers  
will also complete  the Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living 
Inventory (ADCS- ADL) . 
 The subjects will be assessed with the RBANS and MMSE instruments at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, and [ADDRESS_573068] to their AD on a 1-7 point scale, where:

unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disea se temporally 
associated with the use of an investigational medicinal product, whether or not related to the 
investigational medicinal product. All adverse events, including observed or volunteered 
problems, complaints, or symptoms, are to be recorded on t he appropriate eCRF.  
Adverse events, which include abnormal and clinically significant clinical laboratory test 
variables, will be monitored and documented from the time Informed Consent  until study 
participation is complete (the Follow -up Visit). Subjects  should be instructed to report any 
adverse event that they experience to the Investigator. Any medical condition present prior to 
consent should be recorded in medical history. Beginning with the signing of the informed 
consent until the time of the first dose of study drug, investigators should make updates to source 
record s to document  any pre -existing medical condition or signs or symptoms that change  in 
severity, frequency, or seriousness in the medical history ; if the subject is su bsequently 
randomized, these occurrences  will be reported as adverse event s that began prior to dosing. 
Serious adverse events that occur prior to the first dose of study drug should be reported 
similarly, except that an  SAE re port will be completed regar dless of whether the subject is 
randomized..  
Beginning with the first dose of study drug , investigators should make an assessment for adverse 
events at each visit and record all adverse events, non -serious and serious, on the appropriate 
adverse event eCRF.  
Wherever possible, a specific disease or syndrome rather than individual associated signs and 
symptoms should be identified by [CONTACT_449623] t he eCRF. However, if an 
observed or reported sign or symptom is not considered a component of a specific disease or syndrome by [CONTACT_737], it should be recorded as a separate adverse event on the eCRF. Additionally, the condition that led to a medical or surgical procedure (e.g., surgery, endoscopy, 
tooth extraction, or transfusion) should be recorded as an adverse event, not the procedure. 
Concomitant procedures should be recorded as such on the appropriate eCRF.  
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory values or other examinations (e.g., ECG) that are 
detected after the fir st dose of study drug  and worsen during the study should be reported as 
adverse events. An abnormal laboratory result that is not verified by [CONTACT_449624]. The Investigator will exercise his or her medical,

9.2 Definitions 
9.2.1 Adverse Drug Reaction  
For adverse events with a causal relationship to study drug, follow-up by [CONTACT_449625] a level acceptable to the Investigator. 
9.2.2 Unexpected  Adverse Event/ Unexpected  Adverse Drug Reaction  
An unexpected AE/unexpected suspected adverse reaction is an AE or suspected adverse 
reaction that is not listed in the Investigator Brochure
 or is not listed at the specificity or severity 
that has been observed; or, if an Investigator Brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the cur rent application, as amended. 
9.2.3 Serious Adverse Event s  
An adverse event or adverse reaction is considered serious if, in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death;  
• A life -threatening adverse event;  
• NOTE: An adverse event or adverse reaction is considered “life -threatening” if, in view 
of either the Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the subject  at immediate risk 
of death. It does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe f orm, might 
have caused death. 
• Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_97889]; 
NOTE: Any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_416076]. An emergency room visit without hospi[INVESTIGATOR_256267] a SAE under this criterion, nor will hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a procedure scheduled or planned before signing of informed consent. However, unexpected complications and/or prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_449603]. Admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_186223] (i.e., no place to stay, live too far away to come for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6042]) will not be considered inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] s.  
• A persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions; 
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect; or  
• An important medical event.  
NOTE: Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12475], based upon appropriate medical 
Protocol:  BPN14770- CNS -201 Tetra Discovery Partners, Inc.  
Date: [ADDRESS_573076]  and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such 
medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
9.3 Assessment of Adverse Events by [CONTACT_737] 
9.3.1 Causality/Relatedness  
The relationship of an adverse event to the administration of the study drug is to be assessed by [CONTACT_304735]: 
Not Related  (unlikely r elated, unrelated, not related, no relation) – The time course between the 
administration of study drug and the occurrence or worsening of the adverse event rules out a causal relationship and /or another cause (e.g., medical history, concomitant drugs, the rapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and 
complications) is suspected. 
Related  (possibly related, related) – The time course between the administration of study drug 
and the occurrence or worsening of the adverse event is consistent with a causal relationship and 
no other cause (e.g., medical history, concomitant drugs, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and complications) can be identified.  
The definition implies a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship between the event and the study drug. This means that there are facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship.  The following factors should also be considered: 
• The temporal sequence from study drug administration - The event should occur after 
the study drug is given. The length of time from study drug exposure to event should be eval uated in the clinical context of the event. 
• Underlying, concomitant diseases (medical history) -   Each report should be 
evaluated in the context of the natural history and course of the disease being treated and any other disease the subject  may have.  
• Conc omitant drug - The other drugs the subject  is taking or the treatment the subject  
receives should be examined to determine whether any of them might be recognized to cause the event in question.  
• Known response pattern for this class of study drug - Clinic al and/or preclinical data 
may indicate whether a particular response is likely to be a class effect.  
• Exposure to physical and/or mental stresses - The exposure to stress might induce 
adverse changes in the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_23567] a logical and better explan ation for the 
event.  
Protocol:  BPN14770- CNS -201 Tetra Discovery Partners, Inc.  
Date: 24 September 2019  Confidential  
Page 41 of 61 • The pharmacology and PK of the study drug - The known pharmacologic properties 
(absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) of the study drug should be 
considered. 
9.3.2 Severity  
The Investigator is responsible for assessing the sev erity ( intensity ) of each adverse event as 
mild, moderate, or severe according to the following definitions: 
Mild  – An event that is easily tolerated and generally not interfering with normal daily activities.  
Moderate – An event that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal daily activities.  
Severe – An event that is incapacitating with inability to work or perform normal daily activities.  
It should be noted that a severe AE need not be serious and that a serious adverse event (SAE) 
need not, by [CONTACT_108], be severe. 
9.3.[ADDRESS_573077] be followed to satisfactory resolution or stabilization of the event(s), or, if a chronic 
condition, until fully characterized.  All follow -up results are to be reported to the Sponsor.  Any 
actions taken and follow -up results must be recorded either on the appropriate page of the CRF 
or in a follow -up letter to the Sponsor, as well as in the subject’s source documentation.  Follow-
up laboratory results should be filed with the subject’s source documentation.   
For all AEs that require the subject to be  discontinued from the study, relevant clinical 
assessments and laboratory tests must be repeated at appropriate intervals until final resolution or 
stabilization of the event(s).  
Subjects who have non- serious AEs that are ongoing at study completion or study withdrawal 
must be followed until resolution of the AEs or for [ADDRESS_573078] and clinical research organization 
(CRO) within 24 hours  after the SAE detection, observation, or report of occurrence (regardless 
of the relationship to study treatment) .  The Sponsor and the CRO medical monitor contact

the Sponsor  and submit any supporting documentation (e.g., subject  discharge summary or 
autopsy reports). 
Any new SAE that occurs within one month after the study period and is considered to be 
possibly related to the investigational product  should be recorded and reported immediately to 
the Sponsor.   
All serious event reporting will adhere to Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), specifically 21 
CFR 312.32 (7- and 15- day alerts) for  Investigational New Drugs  (IND).  The clinical research

11 PLANNED STATISTICAL METHODS  
11.1 Sample Size  
The BPN14770- CNS -201 study will enroll 255 subjects (85 per treatment arm), in anticipation of 
evaluating at least 240 subjects (80 per treatment).   The Primary Efficacy Outcome measure will 
be change from baseline at Week 13  for the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of 
Neurological Status - Delayed Memory Index (RBANS DMI).    
 The normalized mean of the RBANS DMI is 100, with an SD of 15, and the test- retest reliability 
is 0.[ADDRESS_573087].
9   RBANS DMI was used in a 
recent natural history study of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) due to probable AD.16 In the 
large amnestic MCI sample (81 subjects), the mean was 73.4 with a SD of 16.5 in a normal distribution.  Performance of healthy, age-matched controls was a mean of 101.4 with a SD of 
14.4 (81 subjects) yielding estimates of the standard deviation for the DMI from 14.4-16.5.    Therefore, the power analysis is based on the assumption that the standard deviation of the 
response variable is 16.    
The power of the proposed study is driven by [CONTACT_449627]14770 25mg (higher dose) and placebo.  Based on randomization of [ADDRESS_573088] a treatment difference at a 
two-sided 0.05 significance level, if the true difference between BPN14770 25 mg and placebo is

deviation of the DMI is 16.

Summary statistics [number (n), mean, standard deviation (SD), minimum, median, and maximum] will be tabulated for the observed values for all continuous demographic parame ters.  
Frequencies and percentages will be tabulated for categorical data.  
11.3 Analysis Populations 
The primary efficacy population will be the intent to treat (ITT) efficacy population, which will include all randomized subjects who received at least one dose of treatment and returned for at least one follow-up visit. The per protocol (PP) population (randomized subjects who received at least one dose of treatment and returned for at least one follow- up visit with no significant 
protocol violations) and the completers (CP) population (randomized subjects who completed all 13 weeks of treatment with no significant protocol violations) will be used to evaluate the robustness of the ITT results. 
The Safety population will include all randomized subjects who received at least one dose of study treatment.

During the monitoring visits, information recorded on the eCRFs will be verified against source documents and requests for clarification or correction may be made. After the eCRF data is entered by [CONTACT_779], the CRA will r eview the data for safety information, completeness, accuracy, 
and logical consistency. Computer programs that identify data inconsistencies may be used to help monitor the clinical study. If necessary, requests for clarification or correction will be sent  
to investigators. The Investigator and his/her staff will be expected to cooperate with the monitor and provide any missing information, whenever possible. 
All monitoring activities will be reported and archived. In addition, monitoring visits will be 
documented at the investigational site by [CONTACT_76775] -specific monitoring log 
and findings documented in a follow- up letter.  
It is important that the Investigator and their relevant personnel are available during the monitoring visits and that sufficient time is devoted to the proces s.

16.3.1 RBANS  
The Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status ( RBANS ) is a brief, 
individually administered test measuring attention, language, visuospatial/constructional abilities, 
and immediate and delayed memory.9 It consists of 12 subtests, which yield five Index scores and 
a Total Scale score.  
16.3.2 MMSE  
The Mini–Mental State Examination (MMSE)  is a 30 -point questionnaire that is used extensively 
in clinical and research settings to measure cognitive impairment. It is commonly used to screen for dementia.
10 It consists of a series of questions and tests, each of which scores points if 
answered correctly. The MMSE tests a number of different mental abilities, including a person's memory, attention and language. 
16.3.3 ADCS -ADL  
The Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study scale for ADL (ADCS - ADL)
10,[ADDRESS_573105] was developed primarily to assess severity level in persons with dementia but it can be used to stage dementia in other illnesses as well (e.g., Parkinson's disease). Six domains are assessed and then synthesized to assign a Global CDR score. The domains are memory, orientation, judgment and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies, and personal care. Impairment is defined only when caused by [CONTACT_449637]- cognitive factors. Severity ratings 
range along a 5 -point scale (except for the personal care domain) : 
• CDR -0: no cognitive impairment 
• CDR -0.5: questionable or very mild dementia 
• CDR -1: mild  
• CDR -2: moderate 
• CDR -3: severe  
 The CDR is frequently utilized in clinical and research settings to describe stage -dependent 
features of dementia and for use as a clinically -meaningful outcome measure in clinical drug trials.  
 
16.3.5 Modified Hachinski Ischemia Score (MHIS)

2. History of stroke (1 point) 
3. Focal neurological symptoms  (2 points) 
4. Focal neurological signs  (2 points) 
5. CT-Low density areas isolated (2 points) or  multiple  (3 points) 
 Maximum Total Score = 10  
A 9-10 point total score points to the existence of old or recent cerebrovascular lesions, simple or 
multiple.

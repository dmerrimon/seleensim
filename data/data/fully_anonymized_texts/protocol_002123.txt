 PROTOCOL SUMMARY  
 
Title:              Fatty acid supplements alter biological signatures in children with Autism Spectrum  
            Disorder  
Background:  Fatty acid supplements are among the most popular complementary products  consumed by 
[CONTACT_162969] (ASD). Their use is driven by [CONTACT_162970] a few small RCTs that demonstrated improvements in some externalizing behaviors 
in this population.1-3 Overall, there remains scant evidence for efficacy in treating the core 
symptoms of ASD like social -communication deficits and restricted and repetitive behaviors. 
Furthermore, very litt le is known about the biological signatures that are affected. Ove r-the-
counter (OTC) fatty acid supplements are plentiful and consist of varying percentages of 
gamma -linoleic acid (GLA, an omega -6 fatty acid), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, an omega -3), 
and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, omega -3) and often include vitamins or plant extracts as well. 
Existing RCTs have tested varying combinations of fatty acids with conflicting results that likely 
stem from this variation. Because there are no approved medications  to treat the core 
symptoms of ASD, well -intentioned parents are r eaching for any product that promises 
improvement in their child, but they are giving these supplements without guidance as to their 
function, mechanism of action, or whether they are harmful or helpful in symptom management.  
 
For the proposed project, we will focus on preschool  and early school aged children because of 
the extensive literature indicating that a wide range of ASD therapi[INVESTIGATOR_162937]. This may be because neuroplasti city 
decreases significantly as children age, accompanied by [CONTACT_162971][INVESTIGATOR_162938] a corresponding decline in rate with age .4 Along similar lines,  it has 
recently been reported that fatty acid bioavailability and  treatment effects in children may 
depend partially on body size (smaller children exhibit higher fatty acid levels for a given dose 
than larger children). Many pediatric medications are dos ed based on body weight; however, 
this concept has been virtually never applied to fatty acid supplementation. Aside from 
considerations about body size, only rarely are fatty acid supplements subjected to dose -
ranging trials where a variety of doses are e xamined simultaneously to identify the most 
efficacious and tolera ble. At most, a few studies have tested 2 doses vs placebo. These gaps in 
the literature represent a barrier to informing patients and clinicians about optimal dosing for a 
given child, with the end result that some children likely take a dose too small to  benefit.  
 
Population:  A randomized, fully -blind, placebo -controlled trial of 66 children ages 2 -6 years with recently -
diagnosed ASD. The tr ial will involve 90 days of treatment with one of 3 different doses  (25 mg, 
50 mg, or 75 mg twice per day , using child weight)  of Omega 3 -6 or (equal volume) placebo  
and will include 4 study visits.  
 
Study 
Objectives : 
 1) Optimize safety and bioavailability of Omega 3 -6 in a unique population of children with ASD; 
2) Evaluate the effect of Omega 3 -6 supplementation on  biological signatures of inflammation .

no approved medications e xist to treat the core symptoms . Atypi[INVESTIGATOR_162940], but the side effects are significant, common, and of particular 
concern for very young children.5 Behavioral interventions can offer families approaches to live with 
the atypi[INVESTIGATOR_162941], but they are not cures. Because of the dearth of 
effective treatm ents, between 52% and 95% of families commonly try complementary therapi[INVESTIGATOR_162942], based largely on anecdotal evidence. To date, the results of 
efficacy trials testing fatty acid supplementation for ASD are mixed for several reaso ns including 
variation in the particular combination and dose of fatty acids tested and study design shortcomings 
including lack of blinding or placebo control. Another major reason for the lack of clarity is the very 
limited extent to which studies have e valuated potential biological signatures of interest in order to 
shed light on the pathways through which fat ty acids may exert their effect. This proposal will 
determine a primary pathway through which Om ega [ADDRESS_189129] that may help their  child. 
The implications are that fatty acid supplements are given to children without any evidence base as 
to their function, mechanism of action, or benefits versus harms. Overall, there remains scant 
evidence for efficacy of fatty acids in treating core  ASD symptoms from well -designed and 
adequately -powered RCTs, and very little is known about the mechanism(s) of action. Over -the-
counter (OTC) fatty acid supplements are plentiful and consist of varying percentages of oleic acid 
(n-9), gamma -linolenic aci d (GLA, n -6), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and/or docosahexaenoic acid 
(DHA) and often include vitamins or other plant extracts. Existing RCTs have tested varying 
combinations and doses of fatty acids, and conflicting results likely stem from this variatio n. Recent 
evidence from our group and others suggest a combination of fish and borage oils providing 
supplementation of DHA, EPA and GLA (“Omega 3 -6”) is particularly promising compared to other 
formulations. Based on these foundations, a critical need exi sts to evaluate Omega [ADDRESS_189130] that the inflammatory markers, IL -1β, IL-2, and IFN γ are consistently elevated in 
children with ASD and decreases in these markers correlate with ASD symptom improvement . 
The rationale for the proposed research  is that its successful completion will provide the 
infrastructure and endpoints necessary to support a  future efficacy trial to give parents and 
clinicians unequiv ocal evidence for fatty acid supplementation for AS D.

 2.2 Biological Pathways and Mechanisms  
Fatty acids (FA) have diverse and complex biological functions. Long chain polyunsaturated fatty 
acids of the omega -[ADDRESS_189131] e pathways. The omega -3 DHA comes from fatty fish or algal sources, is 
the primary neuro -active fatty acid in the brain, and is a key player in neurotransmitter function, 
synaptogenesis, gene expression, membrane fluidity, neurogenesis, neuroplasticity, an d anti -
inflammation .6-11 EPA, also from fish oil, is often included in omega -3 fatty acid supplements and 
has triglyceride lowering properties and anti -inflammatory properties similar to DHA. GLA is a 
shorter -chain fatty acid of the omega -6 series derived from plant sources including borage and 
evening primrose. GLA is a precursor to fatty acids such as arachidonic acid (AA) which is essential 
for lipid signaling and hormone synthesis. Biologically available GLA is q uickly co nverted to dihomo -
γ-linolenic acid (DGLA), which now has been shown to have substantial anti -inflammatory 
properties unique among longer chain n -[ADDRESS_189132] binding to g -coupled protein 
receptor 120 ( GCPR120) or peroxisome proliferator -activated receptor gamma (PPAR γ) to inhibit 
MAPK or NFkB activation, production of alternative lipid products such as resolvins and protectins, 
and changes in membrane composition that alters ligand binding to cytokine or toll -like receptors.   
Children with ASD have been shown to exhi bit altered fatty acid metabolism; several investigations 
have shown decreased levels of DHA, EPA, and AA in these children. The reason for these 
decreases i s not completely clear but may be due to a combination of diet differences, altered 
absorption, def ects in fatty acid synthesis because of polymorphisms in fatty acid desaturase genes 
(FADS2) or other metabolic alterations .13-[ADDRESS_189133] widely investigated fatty acid for treatment of mental disorders and has 
demonstrated efficacy in patients with depressive or schizophrenic symptoms. In addition, DHA 
reduces the risk of mild or significant mental delay in extremely preterm infan ts.16 However, DHA 
alone appears to exhibit little or no benefit in treating aberrant behavioral symptoms .17 Adding EPA 
to DHA (“EPA+DHA ,” usually in the form of fish oil) has been evaluated in 4 RCTs for benefi ts to 
individuals with ASD. One small trial (n=13) showed benefit to language and maladaptive 
behaviors ,[ADDRESS_189134] recent trial 
reported worsening externalizing behaviors .19 EPA+DHA has been shown to be moderately 
efficacious in reducing symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in large RCTs 
(meta-analysis standardized mean difference=0.31, 95% CI: 0.16, 0.47) .20 The combination of 
Omega 3 -6 holds significant promise to be more efficacious than EPA+DHA for ASD for several 
reasons. Direct comparison of the e vidence for Omega 3 -6 vs EPA+DHA for treating ADHD in a 
recent meta -analysis reported larger effect sizes and more consistent benefit for omega 3 -6 than for 
EPA+DHA (standard difference in means -0.31 favoring omega 3 -6-9 (CI: -0.46, -0.16)) .[ADDRESS_189135] of these studies, Richardson e t al. found a >0.[ADDRESS_189136] deviation reduction in global

characterized in patients with ASD with increases in inflammatory cytokines and chemokines both in 
the circulation and C SF.  Interleukin (IL) -1β is an acute response cytokine produced by [CONTACT_162972] . 24 IL-1β 
can cross th e blood -brain –barrier, inducing increased permeabil ity or be produced by [CONTACT_162973].  Increases in IL -1β in neurological tissues, causes increased exocytosis 
of several neurotransmitters, resulting in increased excitability, anxiety, and activation of the 
HPA.25,26 Interleukin (IL) -2 has been extensively studied in the context of brain development and T -
cell fate .27 IL-2 acts in a trophic manner during development and loss of IL -2 causes deficits in 
learning and memory processing in animal studies. Alternatively, IL -2 regulates immunological 
homeostasis, self -tolerance and T cell development and function implying dysregulation may play a 
significant role in neurological auto -immune diseases .24,27 Interferon gamma (IFNγ ) is produced 
primarily by [CONTACT_14198][INVESTIGATOR_162943]. 
Besides its effects in mediating viral  immunity, IFN γ also modulates adaptive immunity through 
skewing T cell responses to an inflammatory Th1 phenotype .28-30 A recent meta -analyses of clinical 
studies in ASD patients revealed that IL -1β and IFNγ  were b oth elevated in  virtually every study 
included (IL-2 was not evaluated) and we observed similar increases in IL -1β and IFN γ in our 
Preemie Tots study.[ADDRESS_189139] that DHA accretion in the de velopi[INVESTIGATOR_162938] a

 4 STUDY DESIGN  
4.1 Study Participants  
This single -site study will be conducted at Nationwide Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (NCH). We will recruit 
from among patients who have received an ASD diagnosis  at NCH  within the prior [ADDRESS_189142] Autism Diagnostic 
Observation Schedule -2 (ADOS -2) in the “autism” range which is on the severe end of the  
spectrum, and who meet the other eligibility criteria for the study will be recruited. We focus on 
children in t his range to reduce the heterogeneity of the sample and to maximize the probability of 
benefit.  
After diagnosis, children will be evaluated for  trial eligibility based on medical record review and 
parent interview. Paren ts will be contact[CONTACT_162975], phone , and/or email  to discuss participation.   
Inclusion criteria: age 2 -6 years, ASD diagnosis at NCH within prior 6 months with an 
ADOS -2 score in the “autism” (severe) ran ge, English is primary language.  
Exclusion criteria:  fatty acid supplements in the past 6 months, consume fatty fish >3 
times/week, still breast or formula feeding; quadriparesis; deafness; seizure disorder, 
blindness; bleeding disorder; autoimmune disorders including Type I diabetes; Fragile X, 
Rett, Angleman Syndromes; Tuberous Sclerosis; feeding problems precluding consumption 
of the  supplement; ingredient allergy ; planned surgeries scheduled within the timeframe of 
trial part icipation.  
 
Additionally,  and as part of the informed consent process, Study Staff will ensure that parents have 
a good understanding of study procedures and are able to comply with study procedures for the 
entire length of the study.

The following data items will be collected from the child’s medical record:  
 Results of the comprehensive ASD evaluation conducted at the NCH Child Development 
Cente r including scores from developmental and behavioral testing and clinical summary 
notes  
 Related diagnoses including gastrointestinal disorders and other developmental and 
behavioral diagnoses (e.g., ADHD) and dates of diagnoses

will maintain the randomization sequence such that it is unavailable to other team members. 
Randomized block sizes will be generated within each of 4 strata formed by [CONTACT_162979] 2 
stratification variables: age (2 -3 vs 4 -6 years) and sex. This stratification design minimizes 
confounding across groups due to the stratification variables. This block design assures a 
balanced allocation across the [ADDRESS_189149]. Furthermore, having an experienced statistician not otherwise 
involved in study operations produce the randomization scheme will help maintain blinding 
which is critical to the integrity of the trial and the value of the findings. Investigato rs, staff, 
parents , and participants will be blind to treatment assignment until all data are collected 
whereupon only those involved in analysis will be unblinded as needed.  One to two staff people  
(Adherence Aides) will be unblind and have the sole role of counseling families with strategies 
for protocol compliance (encouraging children to ingest the assigned volume) during scheduled 
phone calls. In order to perform this duty,  they will need to have access to information about 
assigned dose.   
 
 
[CONTACT_163004] h will create tamper -resistant opaque envelopes. These will be sequentially numbered 
with study ID numbers (a sequence prepared for each of the 4 total strata).  These will be placed 
in sequence in 4 labeled and secured boxes, one for each stratum. Each tim e a participant is 
recruited the next envelope in order will be drawn from the stratum specific box that corresponds 
to that participant’s stratum. Inside each envelope will be a designation (e.g., one of six letters of 
the alphabet) for assignment to trea tment or placebo and at which dose . This designation will not 
be revealed to families.  The participant will be registered in the electronic medical record system 
and the study doctor will print and sign the prescription . The participant study ID will be ad ded to 
this prescription. Study staff will alert the NCH Investigational Drug Service as to the enrollment 
and randomization of the participant  and the participant’s weight . IDS will be given the signature 
[CONTACT_163003]. IDS will have access to the randomization scheme 
so they can match the letter designation and ID to the appropriate treatment and dose. IDS will 
prepare the prescription and the oil will be distributed directly from the pharmacy to the family  to 
prevent unbli nding of study staff .

Study participation will be discontinued under the following circumstances:  
 
1. PI [INVESTIGATOR_162946];  
 
2. Participant’s  legal guardian requests withdraw from the study;  
 
3. Any clinical AE , laboratory abnormality, intercurrent illness, or other medical condition or 
situation occurs such that continued participation in the study would not be in the best 
interest of the child , as deter mined by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_162947]; or  
 
4. Development of any e xclusion criteria may be cause for discontinuation.  
 
5. Study instructions are not followed, participation in the study may also be stopped  
Withdrawal from the study will not affect the receipt of clinical care at NCH. If the study is halted for 
any reason, p articipants will be instructed to discontinue taking the assigned treatment and return 
the unused portion to study staff .  Participants who choose to discontinue taking the assigned 
treatment during the study will continue to be followed for assessment of the outcomes, and their 
discontinuation will be recorded in the study database. Participants who continue to participate but

days  and one remote “e -visit” at 25 days . Visit 1 will involve informed consent, randomization, 
gathering anthropometric data, parent completed questionnaires, distributi on and explanation of the 
study diaries, a 3 mL blood collection, and distribution of the treatment oil /placebo  oil. This visit will 
last approximately [ADDRESS_189153] approximately 60 
minutes . They  will involve returning all  oil bottles distributed at the prior in -person visit , review of 
study diaries, assessment of compliance and adverse events, parent  completed ques tionnaires, 
and a 3 mL blood collection . In addition, study staff will check in with families at four other time 
points  (Day 5  +/-3 days , Day 35  +/-7 days , Day 60 +/-7 days , and Day 80  +/-7 days ) to assess 
compliance, adverse events, and barriers to partici pation. We  will ask families for updated contact 
[CONTACT_162980], as well as to provide up to three additional contacts (e.g., 
friends/family) who we may contact [CONTACT_162981].  
6.1 Visit 1 (Day 0)  
The enrollment visit will consist of the following activities:  
 
Informed Consent:  See Informed Consent section . 
 
Randomization: After consent, families will be randomized . See Randomization and Masking 
Procedures .  
 
Blood Collection: To measure baseline fatty  acid levels, a trained pediatric phlebotomist will draw 3 
mL whole blood into a purple top tube.  
 
Anthropometrics: Child weight  and height will be measured using SECA scales  and stadiometer  to 
inform IDS in calculat ing the assigned dose . If child cannot be accurately weighed, staff will use 
most recent weight found in medical record system  (EPIC) . 
 
Parent Perception of Treatment Group : Parents will be asked what treatment group they believe  
their child will be in . 
 
Barriers to Participation: The family’s intentions to complete the study, attend the next study visit, 
and give their child the assigned oil on a daily basis throughout study duration . 
 
Parent Interview: A parent interview will gather baseline child and family characteristics (sex, age, 
socioeco nomic index) to characterize the sample and verify comparability across groups. In 
addition, parents will complete the Baylor fatty acid -specific food frequency questionnaire  as an 
interview  to measure usual dietary intake of long -chain fatty acids. Finall y, parents are asked to 
report on current medications , upcoming surgeries,  as well as use of compl ementary and behavioral 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_162948].  
 
Supplement Dispension : Study staff will counsel families on instructions for taking the daily 
treatment oil /placebo  oil, how to record each dose in a provided daily study diary, and reporting 
adverse events. IDS will dispense (4) [ADDRESS_189154] on  taking 
the assigned oil .

 Compensation :  At the conclusion of the visit, participants receive $ 75 in compensation for their time  
and a Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_162949] ($2). Children are given a developmentally -
appropriate children’s book or small toy (value =$5).  
 
Visit scheduling:  Study staff will schedule for in-person visits 2 and 3 . 
 
6.2 E-Visit  (Day 25   +/- [ADDRESS_189155] ) 
This visit will be a remote “ E-Visit” via phone and will include the following activities:  
 
Parent Perception of Treatment Group and Adherence : Parents will be asked what treatment group 
they perceive their child to be in and to estimate what propor tion of doses they administered out of 
the desired number and what proportion of the assigned oil they estimate their child usually 
consumed. Study staff will review study  diaries use with the parent and will probe for any problems 
encountered that reflect  acceptability, tolerability or compliance. Study staff will request that the 
caregiver take photos of each study diary page used thus far. Caregiver  will email or text study staff 
with these photos.  
 
Adverse Events:  Parents will be asked if the child has  any health or behavior changes since the last 
communication. We will use a modified version of the Safety Monitoring Uniform Report 
Form  (SMURF ) to document adverse events.  
 
Barriers to Participation: The family’s intentions to complete the study, attend the next study visit, 
and give their child the assigned oil on a daily basis throughout study duration; as well as any 
anticipated barriers to study participation are assessed during each contact [CONTACT_39118].  
 
To simplify our recruitment and retention  materials, participants will  see that there are 3 in -person 
visits  and 5 follow up phone calls . This “ E-Visit Day 25 ” phone call will be one of the five follow -up 
contacts.  
6.3 Visit 2 (Day 45  +/- 14 days )  
This visit will consist of the following activities : 
 
The following activities will follow the same procedures as for Visit 1: Blood Collection , Parent 
Interview, Parent Perception of Treatment Group and Adherence, Adverse Events, Barriers to 
Participation.   
 
Supplement Return: Families will return all pre viously dispensed oil bottles to IDS for calculating of 
used/unused portion .  
 
Supplement Dispension:  IDS will dispense (4)  8 oz bottles of assigned oil  (extra bottle will be 
dispensed if child is over 32 kg) . IDS will dispense the assigned oil directly to  the family and will 
further instruct on taking the assigned oil.  Completed study diary pages will be scanned and diary 
returned. New diary dispensed as necessary.   
 
Compensation : Compensation will be the same as for Visit 1. In addition, f amilies will receive $2 for 
every study diary returned at the study visit (1 diary page covers a 2-week  period).

The final visit will consist of the following activities:  
 
The following activities will follow the same procedures as for Visi t 2: Blood Collection, Parent 
Interview, Parent Perception of Treatment Group and Adherence, Adverse Events, Supplement 
Return.  
 
Anthropometrics: Child weight and height will be measured using SECA scales and stadiometer.   
 
Supplement Return: Families will  return any empty assigned oil  bottles and any partially used or 
unopened assigned oil  bottles to IDS.  
 
Compensation :  Compensation will be the same as for Visit 2, except i f families completed all 4 
study visits  (1 of which is the E -Visit) , they will rec eive an additional $20 incentive.  Families will 
receive $2 for every study diary returned at the study visit (1 diary  page  covers a 2-week  perio d). 
 
6.5 Additional Routine Communication  (throughout participation)  
In addition to the study visits, study staff w ill routinely check in with families at least 5 times (more if 
a family requires additional support) spaced between the visits  to assess adherence, adverse 
events, and barriers to participation. These check s may take place in person, over the phone, or 
through email or text , depending on family preference  and ease of communicating .  
 
Families will be reminded of scheduled/upcoming appointments via phone, email and/or text (based 
on family preference). Attempts will be made via phone, email, text, and/or mai l to contact [CONTACT_162982]. During these communications, both remotely and in 
person, parents may be asked to estimate what proportion of doses they administered out of the 
desired number and what proportion of the ass igned oil they estimate their child usually consumed.  
Interim study diary  data will be collected in the form of photos (of each completed study diary page) 
as often as possible from caregiver via email or text.  This will assist in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_162950] -person visits. Study 
staff will work with the family to increase adherence where possible. We will use the modified Safety 
Monitoring Uniform Report Form  (SMURF ) to document  adverse events. Children who do not return 
for the [ADDRESS_189156] them via phone at these pre -prescribed intervals.  
 
6.6 Rationale for Data Collection  
Data are collected to: 
 
1) Assess demographic and other participant characteristic s, thereby [CONTACT_17155] a check of the 
randomization procedure  and to report on the composition of the sample ; 
2) Assess the outcomes of interest ; and  
3) Determine the feasibility of and aims for the next s tage of research .

 7 LABORATORY EVALUATIO NS  
7.1 Specimen Preparation, Handling, and Shippi[INVESTIGATOR_162951], handling, and storage of specimens are explained clearly in the 
study’s SOP, including required temperatures, aliquots of specimens, wh ere they will be stored, and 
how they will be labeled. Samples will be stored at -80oC until analysis in [CONTACT_163005] ’ 
laboratory in the Center for Perinatal Research. All laboratory analyses of biospecimens will be 
conducted by [CONTACT_162983]. Serum and RBC samples will be collected from patients at [ADDRESS_189157] protocols using gas 
chromatography and will include : capric (10:0), lauric (12:0), myristic (14:0), palmitic  (16:0) , 
palmitoleic (16:1n -7), steric  (18:0) , oleic  (18:1 n -9), vaccenic (18:1n -7), linoleic  acid (18:2 n -6), 
-linolenic acid (18:3 n -3) , -linolenic acid (18:3 n -6), dihomo γ -linolenic acid (DGLA, 20:3  n-6) 
arachidonic (AA, 20:4n -6), eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA,  20:5 n -3), and docosahexaenoic acid 
(DHA , 22:6 n -3).  High and low controls will be run with each bat ch analysis and a run will be 
considered non -valid if the controls are greater than [ADDRESS_189158] deviations from the mean values 
for DHA, EPA, and GLA.  A non -valid analysis will be discarded and the samples will be re -
analyzed.  Biological signatures will i nclude the cytokines IL-1β, IL-2, IFN γ.  These inflammatory 
cytokines will be measured using an ELISA based technology offered by [CONTACT_52602]. 
   
Any remaining specimens will be maintained in a secured freezer in the Center for Perinatal 
Research, or Center for Biobehavio ral Health (depending on space availability) at NCH for future 
research use.  Only the investigators for this study will have access to these specimens and 
permission for future use.  The consent form for the study will state that leftover specimens may be

Welch, Holme and Clark  Co., Inc.  will provide the canola oil placebo. Although f atty acid 
composition varies slightly with  each lot of the canola oil,  the dist ributor provides average fatty acid 
composition per 2.5  ml (2.3g) daily serving. Specifically, each 2.5  ml serving of the canola oil 
placebo contains 124  mg of palmitic acid, 39  mg stearic acid, 513  mg linoleic acid, 225  mg linolenic 
acid, and 1346  mg olei c acid.  The bulk canola  oil placebo will be shipped from the distributor in  5-
gallon shipments to NCH IDS who  will mix the oil with lemon oil at  1:66.6 (1.5 mL of lemon oil per 
100 mL of canola oil) . In this way , the treatment oil and placebo  oil will be  indistinguishable  in terms 
of appea rance, smell  and taste. IDS will bottle  and cap  the placebo  oil in identical bottles  and caps  
as the treatment oil .

 9 RISKS AND BENEFITS  
9.1 Risks 
All of the research related procedures, surveys, and questionnaires, are designed to meet the 
definition of “minimal risk” in the fe deral regulations [§45 CFR 46.102(i)] and to be reviewed by [CONTACT_162989] §45 CFR 46.404 “Research not involving greater than minimal risk.” Minimal risk as defined 
in the federal regulations means “that the probability and magnitude of harm or discomfort 
anticipated in the research are not greater, in and of themselves, than those ordinarily encountered 
in daily life or during the performance of routine physical or psychological examinations or tests.” In 
addition, the Study Staff is committed to minimizing r isks even when the risks are minimal.  
 
The informed consent process will take place in private. Questionnaires will be structured to avoid 
creating discomfort for the research participants; and participants will be reminded at each data 
collection encount er that participation is voluntary, that they have the right to withdraw from the 
research project at any time, and they may refuse to answer or may skip any question.  
 
Experienced pediatric phlebotomists staff will perform biospecimen collections that inv olve minimal 
discomfort or pain. All staff involved in collection of biospecimens will be credentialed accordingly. 
The physical risks of drawing blood by [CONTACT_1299] a needle in a vein may cause pain, lightheadedness, 
bleeding, bruising, or swelling at the pu ncture site.  Infection is a rare possibility.  No alternatives to 
blood collection exist to reliably assess fatty acid and inflammatory status in humans.  
 
The risks of collecting and storing linked clinical data and biospecimens are primarily psycho -socia l. 
Developi[INVESTIGATOR_162954] a fundamental ethical requirement of the 
study. Potential harm could result from a breach of confidentiality. One of the primary concerns is 
that employment and insurance discrimination might resul t from exposure of information about 
health history, genetic makeup, or familial predisposition to disease. The risk is minor, especially 
since unique participant identifiers will not be stored with biospecimens.  
The Nordic Naturals Complete OmegaTM liquid  product contains a combination of fish and borage 
oils.  These oils include several LCPUFAs including eicosapentaeonic acid (EPA) and gamma -
linolenic acid (GLA).  Although giving EPA to preterm infants (i.e., children much younger than 
those eligible in t his study) has been found to pose some risk related to poorer growth in a single -
site study that has not been replicated,[ADDRESS_189163] been no published cases or 
studies since these reports were published in 1981.34 Although the likelihood of thi s occurring in the 
present study is very low, children with a  seizure disorder  will be excluded from the study.  A 2004 
study of 238 preterm neonates evaluated an infant formula with fish and borage oil compared to a 
vegetable oil formula fed to infants fo r 9 months.35 Daily intake amounts varied based on volume 
consumed, but the fish and borage oil group received up to an estimated 26mg per day of GLA. 
This is the equivalent of between 3 and 17 mg/kg/day depending o n the ch ild’s body composition

an allergy to canola/rapeseed is controversial, but very rarely some people may have a non -allergic 
reaction.  Nevertheless, we will exclude any  children whose parent states they have 
canola/rapeseed allergy or sensitivity.  Lemon oil is Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) by [CONTACT_1556].  
 
The study staff will maintain confidentiality of the data in its databases. Data will be summarized in 
aggregate for reporting purposes. Data submitted to the study does include participant identifiers, 
as defined by [CONTACT_941] U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).  The 
study will follow all necessary measures to assure the participant da ta stored in the database are 
protected and secure from unauthorized access.   
The knowledge to be gained from this investigation outweighs these minimal risks. This study has  
the potential to inform future dietary recommendations for  children , especially those diagnosed with 
ASD and  associated comorbidities . 
9.[ADDRESS_189165]. Participation in this study 
will aid in acquiring new knowledge that might help other children with an ASD diagnosis and their 
families in the future.  
 
There are no other known benefits expected from participation in this study.

 10  ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
10.1 Methods and Timing for Assess ing, Recording, and Analyzing Safety Parameters  
Safety oversight will be under the direction of the Principal Investigator s (PIs), Study Doctor, and 
the Independent Study Safety Monitor. All adverse events will be reviewed to rule out the study 
interventio n as a potential cause. All Adverse  Events  will be recorded  on a form designated  for 
that purpose,  labeled  with a participant  ID and no personal  identifiers.  For any adverse  events  
required  to be reported  to the IRB or the FDA,  and for review  purposes  by [CONTACT_162990]  (IMC),  only the coded  ID number  will be included  in the documentation  as 
needed,  and no identifiers.  The IMC will review  adverse  events  anonymously.  If the child’s  
medical  record  must  be accessed  to provide  additional  details as to the event  or its treatment,  
study  staff will provide abstracted information  that is  de-identified.  Annual reports of findings will be 
submitted to the FDA in line with IND regulations.  
   
10.2 Adverse Events  
Adverse Event  (AE):  ICH E6 defines an AE  as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or 
clinical investigation  participant  administered a pharmaceutical product regardless of its causal 
relationship to the study treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including  an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associ ated with the use 
of investigational  product. The occurrence of an AE may come to the attention of study personnel 
during study visits and interviews of a study recipi[INVESTIGATOR_162955], or upon review by 
a study monitor.  
All AEs including local and systemic reactions not meeting the criteria for “serious adverse events” 
should be captured on the appropriate CRF. Information to be collected includes event description, 
time of onset, Study Doctor ’s assessment of severity, relationship to study product (assessed only 
by [CONTACT_8703] a diagnosis, which would include MD, PA, Nurse 
Practitioner, DO, or DDS), and time of resolution/stabilization of  the event. All AEs occurring during  
study  participation  must be documented appropriately regardless of relationship. All AEs will be 
followed to adequate resolution.  
Any medical condition that is present at the time that the participant is screened shoul d be 
considered as baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if  the medical condition  deteriorates at 
any time during the study, it should be recorded as an AE.  
All AEs must be graded for severity and relationship to study product.  
Severity of Event:   All AEs will be assessed by [CONTACT_162991] a protocol defined grading 
system. For events not included in the pr otocol defined grading system, the following guidelines will 
be used to quantify intensity.  
 Mild: events require minimal or no treatment  and do not interfere with the participant’s daily 
activities.  
 Moderate : events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic 
measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning.  
 Severe : events interrupt a partic ipant’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug 
therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually incapacitating.

CONFIDENTIAL                                                                                                                                                                 22 May 2018

  Life threatening :  any adverse drug experience that places the participant , in the view of the  PI, 
at immediate risk of death f rom the reaction as it occurred  (i.e., it does not include a reaction 
that had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death ). 
Changes in the severity of an AE should be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of 
the event at each le vel of intensity to be performed. Adverse events characterized as intermittent 
require documentation of onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].  
Relationship to Study Products:   The Study Doctor ’s assessment of an AE's relationship to study 
intervention is part  of the documentation process, but it is not a factor in determining what is or is 
not reported in the study. If there is any doubt as to whether a clinical observation is an AE, the 
event should be reported. All AEs must have their relationship to study p roduct assessed using the 
terms: related or  not related . In a clinical trial, the study product must always be suspect. To help 
assess, the following guidelines are used.  
 Related  (Possible, Probable, Definite)  
a. The event is known to occur with the study int ervention.  
b. There is a temporal relationship between the intervention and event onset.  
c.    The event abates when the intervention is discontinued.  
d. The event reappears upon a re -challenge with the intervention.  
 Not Related  (Unlikely, Not Related)  
a. There is no temporal relationship between the intervention and event onset.  
b. An alternate etiology has been established.  
 
10.3 Unanticipated Problems  
The Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) considers unanticipated problems 
involving risks to subjects or others to i nclude, in general, any incident, experience, or outcome 
that meets all of the following criteria:  
 Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures 
that are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -approved 
research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the 
subject population being studied;  
 Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means 
there is a reasonable possibility that th e incident, experience, or outcome may have 
been caused by [CONTACT_3459]); and  
 Suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including 
physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was p reviously known or 
recognized.

 10.3.1  Reporting Unanticipated Problems  
Incidents or events that meet the OHRP criteria for unanticipated problems will be reported 
using an unanticipated problem report form.  The unanticipated problem report form will include 
the following information when reporting an adverse event, or any other incident, experience, or 
outcome as an unanticipated problem to the IRB:  
 Appropriate identifying information for the research protocol, such as the title, 
investigator’s name, and the IRB  project number;  
 A detailed description of the adverse event, incident, experience, or outcome;  
 An explanation of the basis for determining that the adverse event, incident, experience, 
or outcome represents an unanticipated problem;  
 A description of any  changes to the protocol or other corrective actions that have been 
taken or are proposed in response to the unanticipated problem.  
To satisfy the requirement for prompt reporting, unanticipated problems will be reported using 
the following timeline:   
 Unanticipated problems that are serious adverse events will be reported to the IRB, 
Independent Safety Monitor(s), and NCCIH within 7 days of the investigator becoming 
aware of the event.  
 Any other unanticipated problem will be reported to the IRB, Independe nt Safety 
Monitor(s), and NCCIH within 14 days of the investigator becoming aware of the 
problem.  
All unanticipated problems should be reported to appropriate institutional officials (as required 
by [CONTACT_17347]’s written reporting procedures), the supp orting agency head (or designee), and 
OHRP within one month of the IRB’s receipt of the report of the problem from the investigator.  
10.4 Serious Adverse Events  
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) : An SAE is defined as an AE that meets one of the following 
conditions:  
 
 Death during the period of protocol defined surveillance . 
 Life-threatening event (defined as a subject at immediate risk of death at the time of the 
event) . 
 An event requiring inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_162956] o f protocol defined surveillance.  
 Results in congenital anomaly or birth defect . 
 Results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity . 
 Any other important medical event that may not result in death, be life threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11298], may be considered a serious adverse experience when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, the event may jeopardize the subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Examples of 
such medic al events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an

 emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
The Study PI [INVESTIGATOR_162957].  An adverse event will be considered unexpected if 
the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with the risk information 
previously described for the intervention.   
 
All SAEs will be:  
 Recorded on the appropriate SAE CRF . 
 Followed through  resolution by a Study Doctor . 
 Reviewed an d evaluated by a Study Doctor . 
10.4.1  Reporting  SAE’s  
Any AE considered serious by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_162958] 3 business days of discovery.  All SAEs 
will be followed until satisfactory resolution or until the Study Doctor deems the event to be chronic 
or the patient to  be stable.  
 
Annual reports of findings will be submitted to the FDA in line with IND regulations.  
 
SAEs that are unanticipated, serious, and possibly related to the study intervention will be 
reported to the Independent Monitors(s), IRB, FDA, and NCCIH i n accordance with 
requirements.  For the IND:  
 7-day IND Safety Report (unexpected fatal or life -threatening AEs related to the 
intervention); a copy of the report sent to the FDA will be submitted to the NCCIH 
Program Officer and Independent Safety Monito r(s) within 24 hours of FDA notification.  
 15-day IND Safety Report (any other serious and unexpected AE related to the 
intervention); a copy of the report submitted to the FDA will be submitted to the NCCIH 
Program Officer and Independent Safety Monitor(s ) within 24 hours of FDA notification.  
 All other AEs documented during the course of the trial will be reported to NCCIH on an 
annual basis by [CONTACT_162992].  The Independent 
Safety Monitor(s) Report will state that all AEs have been reviewed.  
10.[ADDRESS_189166] Values/ Clinical Findings  
Collection of laboratory data should be limited to those laboratory param eters that are relevant to 
safety, study outcome measures, and/or clinical outcome. No known fatty acid value is considered 
to be abnormal or to present a safety concern.  As a result, it is not anticipated that any abnormal 
laboratory values will be found . However, a ny abnormal clinical findings will be reported to the 
child’s physicians.

obtained until 7 (for non -serious AEs) or 30 days (for SAEs) after the last day of study participation. 
At each study visit, the investigator will inquire about the o ccurrence of AE/SAEs since the last visit. 
Events will be followed for outcome information until resolution or stabilization.  
10.7  Halting Rules  
If it is found that the study intervention  is related to any serious adverse events, enrollment would 
be tem poraril y suspend ed until a safety review is co nvened , the objective of which is a decision as 
to whether the study (or intervention for an individual or study cohort) should continue per protocol, 
proceed with caution, be further investigated, be discontinued, or  be modified and then proceed. 
Suspension of enrollment (for a particular group or for the entire study) is another potential outcome 
of a safety review.  
 
Subsequent review of serious, unexpected, and related AEs by [CONTACT_978], Study Doctor, the 
Independent St udy Safety Monitor, the IRB , or the FDA or relevant local regulatory authorities may 
also result in suspension of further trial interventions/administration of study product . The FDA  
retain s the authority to suspend additional enrollment and study interven tions/administration of 
study product for the entire study, as applicable.  
 
Based on the large number of previous studies that have utilized a similar intervention in children 
and the widespread use of the study products in the U.S. consumer marketplace, t here are no 
expectations for halting the study enrollment or intervention due to safety concerns.  However, it will 
be left to the judgment of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_162959] a 
pattern of adverse events or other circum stances warrant halting.   
10.8 Safety Oversight  
Safety oversight will be under the direction of the PIs and Independent Study Safety Monitor . All

 11.4 Final Analysis Plan  
 
Aim 1  
Aim 1 Primary Analysis:  To examine group differences in bioavailability and safety, we will 
compare the entire treatment group to the entire placebo group, and at the diff erent dosing 
levels within treatment, by: 1) comparing mean and median %FA for each fatty acid at the end 
of the trial and 2) comparing the total number of adverse events that occurred in each group and 
also by [CONTACT_162994] (e.g., gastrointestinal; s evere vs . not).  
 
Aim 1 Secondary analysis : Demonstrate th at children receiving Omega [ADDRESS_189173] 0.5 mol%, between baseline 
and the end of the trial (i.e., an increase of approx. 2 0% for DHA, 67% for EPA depending on 
baseline status).  
 
Aim 1 Secondary analysis (exploratory):  Explore the effect of dose on changes in RBC EPA and 
DHA by [CONTACT_162995] 3 -6. 
 
 
Aim 2  
Aim 2 Primary Analysis:  To formally examine the efficacy of the intervention, the primary 
analysis will be to compare the treatment group, where anyone assigned to Omega [ADDRESS_189174] change in each inflammatory marker.  
 
Aim 2 Secondary analysis  (exploratory) : Explore  the effect  of dose  by 
[CONTACT_162996]  3-6 dose  to the placebo group  (all children  assigned  to 
placebo)  on pre -post change  in each  inflammatory  marker.  
 
 
The primary approach for the analyses is intent -to-treat: individuals will be kept in the group to 
which they were randomized, regardless of protocol violations or drop -out. Every effort will be made 
to minimize missing data. A nalyses will explore plausible missing data mechanisms, and baseline 
predictors of missingness will be investigated. Also, when possible maximum likelihood estimation 
(MLE) will be employed where predictor variables associated with missingness will be inve stigated 
in sensitivity analyses. MLE generally provides valid inferences when the missing data mechanism 
is missing at random37 and is more appropriate than many commonly employed approaches to data 
imputation.38 
 
We will examine group differences d escriptively on bioavailability and safety data for the entire 
placebo group, the entire treatment group, and (secondarily, exploratory) at the different dosing 
levels within treatment. Specifically, for the Primary Analysis in Aim 1, we will use the indep endent 
samples t -test and the Wilcoxon rank -sum test to examine treatment vs. placebo group differences 
on the %FA for each fatty acid at the end of the trial, the total number of adverse events, and 
number adverse events by [CONTACT_92920]. This approach will allow us to examine both parametric and 
non-parametric approaches to group differences on each of these measures of bioavailability or 
safety.

each inflammatory marker. The following is an illustration of our statistical model for repeated 
measures (RM), similar to analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) but based on maximum likelihood  
estimation, that will be employed for the se analyses39: 
it i t t it Trt Time Time y   [ADDRESS_189176] is 
2 , which corresponds to the difference between the 
groups on change in the inflammatory marker of interest. In this RM model, the baseline measure of 
the individual’s inflammatory  marker is constrained to have equal means across groups by 
[CONTACT_162997] . This constraint yields a statistical test for 
2 analogous to 
the test of the treatment group main effect in an ANCO VA covarying the pretest measure of the 
outcome variable. The main advantage of the RM model is that it can be estimated in SAS PROC 
MIXED using maximum likelihood estimation on all available data by [CONTACT_125908] 
t Time  as a repeated 
measures f actor with 2 levels, whereas an ANCOVA model would require listwise deletion for 
missing data.38  
 
Importantly, for the Secondary/Exploratory Analysis in Aim 2, we will investigate the dose effect by 
[CONTACT_162998] a participant as quantitative and categorical predictors within separate 
models in place of the treatment effect variable, 
iTrt , using the same type of model used in the 
previous analysis. Because of the ex ploratory nature of our hypotheses concerning the parametric 
form of the relationship between dose and the response in each inflammatory marker, separate 
analyses using quantitative and categorical versions of the dosing variable will allow us to fully 
explicate the dose -response relationship. We will conduct exploratory analyses by [CONTACT_162999] a modifier.

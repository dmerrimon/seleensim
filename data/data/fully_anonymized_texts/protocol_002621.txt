BACKGROUND SIGNIFICA NCE  
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a condition associated with expi[INVESTIGATOR_304014] (FRC) (the 
amount of air left in the patients lungs at the end of a normal exhalation ) as well as an increased Residual 
Volume (RV) (the amount of air left in the patient ’s lungs at the end of a forced exhalation ). Such 
increa se in functional residual capacity can in turn lead to increased work of breathing and dyspnea.   
 
Dyspnea in COPD  
Impairment of lung function (usually measured as FEV 1) is one of the common guideline s for defining 
the severity of COPD. Forced Expi[INVESTIGATOR_117067] 1 (FEV 1) is the amount  of air forcibly exhaled during 
the first second of a forced expi[INVESTIGATOR_75043] . It is by [CONTACT_304033].  Dyspnea symptoms (perceived shortness of breath) also contribute to the severity of 
the disease and are the basis of treatment. Breathlessness and exercise intolerance are the most common 
symptoms in chronic obstructive lung disease , and they can present in all sever ity stages either at rest or 
under conditions of exertion and exercise. These symptoms also progress as the disease advances, which 
leads to inactivity and muscle deconditioning.  This can continue in a cycle leading to further inactivity, 
social isolation  and fear of dyspnea. Finally, given that exercise is a r ecommendation in patients with 
COPD, dyspnea can interfere with the best treatment regimen.  
 
In GOLD COPD, classifications are used to describe the severity of the obstruction or airflow limitation.  
The worse a person's airflow limitation is, the lower their FEV 1. As COPD progresses, FEV 1 tends to 
decline. GOLD COPD staging uses four categories of severity for COPD, based on the value of FEV 1 30 
 
 
Stage I  Mild COPD  FEV 1 ≥ 80% normal  
Stage II  Moderat e COPD  FEV 1 50-79% normal  
Stage III  Severe COPD  FEV 1 30-49% normal  
Stage IV  Very Severe COPD  FEV 1 < 30% normal, or < 50% 
normal with chronic respi[INVESTIGATOR_304015] a considerable burd en of disease, even affecting many things that are 
fundamental to everyday life  such as the ability to breathe, talk, walk, sleep, or work.  A telephone  survey 
of patients with COPD living in  North America and in Europe documented the frequen cy of 
breathles sness with daily activities  of 3,[ADDRESS_371915] sitting or lying 
still and 24% when talking. On e-third said they were b reathless when doing light housework or while 
getting washed or dressed, and nea rly 70% were short of breath when walking up a flight of stairs 1, 2. 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_304012] -[ADDRESS_371916] 05 , 2017  
 Pathophysiological factors known to contribute to exertional dyspnea in COPD patients include increased 
intrinsic mechanical loading of inspi[INVESTIGATOR_109458] (PEEPi), inspi[INVESTIGATOR_304016], and increased  
ventilatory demand relative to capacity, gas exchange abnormalities, dynamic airway compression, 
cardiovascular factors, and any combination of the above.  3, [ADDRESS_371917] been found to be linked with physiological changes, such as improved muscle function 
and altered breathing pattern (highe r tidal volume) and lower breathing frequency that leads to a reduced 
dead space to tidal volume ratio and thus to a lower ventilatory requirement for exercise. 5, 6   
 
In order to enhance exercise training programs, patients with COPD need to feel relief from their 
breathlessness.  Treatments to reduce airflow obstruction and/or dyn amic hyperinflation include pursed 
lip breathing (PLB) 7, 8, anti-inflammatory  drugs 9, breathing  helium -oxygen mixtures 10, [ADDRESS_371918] shown that the administration of continuous positive pressure (CPAP) or pressure 
support ventilation (PSV) by [CONTACT_304034]-invasive ventilation (NIV) devices, can improv e exercise 
tolerance and breathlessness in stable COPD patients. It is believed  that increased respi[INVESTIGATOR_304017], associated with high ventilatory demand relative to respi[INVESTIGATOR_304018], may contribute to 
dyspnea in many patients with chron ic respi[INVESTIGATOR_3765].  There have been multiple studies that have 
evaluated t he effect of NIV on dyspnea but only a few studies have considered dyspnea  as an endpoint 
measure.  
A systematic study of COPD patients in pulmonary rehabilitation found that sh ort-term administration of 
NIV during exercise training significantly improve d dyspnea and exercise endurance16.  This was also 
supported by a compi[INVESTIGATOR_304019] 15 studies suggesting that NIV support during exercise may acutely 
reduce exertional dyspnea a nd improve exercise endurance in patients with COPD18. Another study 
compared t wo different  levels  of inspi[INVESTIGATOR_304020]  – 5 and 10 cm H 2O, and found statistically 
significant and large improvements in exercise performance and dyspnea relief using pressure support of 
10 cm H 2O as compared to that  of 5 cm H 2O17. Two studies examining long -term nocturnal use of NIV in 
patients with severe COPD reported significant improvements in dyspnea ratings 19, 20. It has also been 
studied that the use of NIV a s well as CPAP during exercise decreases dyspnea and increases exercise 
tolerance 21, 22 which may facilitate patients’ participation in pulmonary rehabilitation.  
Although there has been research involving the benefit of providing NIV during exercise to i ncrease 
tolerance overall, there is little research specifically looking at shortening dyspnea recovery times 
associated with exercise. Additionally, NIV is usually applied via a face mask and devices need t o be 
connected to a power source thus limiting th e portability of the therapy. In the comparative pressure 
support study referenced above17, the application of NIV was very  similar to the use case of the 
VitaBreath  (Study device) via a mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_304021], but with critical additional benefits of indepe ndent 
usage by [CONTACT_304035].  Open mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_304022] a  useful technique 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_304012] -[ADDRESS_371919] 05 , 2017  
 that may prevent further deterioration of gas exchange in COPD patients with mild to moderate acidosis, 
similar to traditional NIV delivered by a nasal mask23. 
 
We hypothesize that  providing intermittent non -invasive positive pressure therapy (a form of NIV or 
PAP) with a handheld device to COPD patients immediately after exertion can relieve their dyspnea , and 
consequently  allow them to be more a ctive .  This hypothesis will be tested by  [CONTACT_304036] d Lip Br eathing as measured 
by a modified [ADDRESS_371920] (6MWT).   
 
The modified 6MWT  will be  a variation of the sta ndard 6MWT32,[ADDRESS_371921] some anticipated benefit in the Pulmonary Rehab (PR ) setting, this study 
is not intending to be directly associated with a PR program.  Use of a similar environment may be 
coincidental and only to facilitate operational execution in a safe and monitored environment for the 
study.   
 
 
STUDY INTERVENTIONS   
 
VitaBreath  (Investigational)  
 
The Philips Respi[INVESTIGATOR_304023] a handheld, battery powered,  intermittent 
positive airway pressure device that is non -invasive, and provides positive airway pressure (PAP) of [ADDRESS_371922] participant’s bronchodilators, anti -inflammator y medicines, 
and/or supplemental oxygen.  It is not intended to replace pulmonary rehabilitation as well.   
 
The VitaBreath device is designed for non -continuous use only and typi[INVESTIGATOR_304024] [ADDRESS_371923] 05 , 2017  
 mail or climbing stairs.  Although patients may use the device when partic ipating in an exercise program 
that is not the primary intended use of the device . 
 
Pursed Lip Breathing (Control condition ) 
Pursed lip breathing  (PLB) is the standard of care  and will be use d as the control  condition  comparator.  
 
STUDY DESIGN  
 
This will be laboratory -based study  with a 2-arm, randomized, controlled, crossover  design  where the 
partic ipants will be tested with the investigational de vice VitaBreath  and control condition ( PLB) in a 
random order.  
 
STUDY AIM  
 
The aim of this study is to evaluate  that intermittent positive airway pressure therapy given to COPD 
patients with the VitaBreath device will relieve their exertional dyspnea  allowing them to walk further in  
a modified 6MWT.   
 
 
STUDY OBJECTIVES  
 
The primary objective will be to compare the distance walked in 6 minutes by [CONTACT_304037]  (PLB) versus an  intermittent positive airway pr essure handheld device, VitaBreath .  
 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint:  Distance walked as measured by [CONTACT_300469] 6MWT  evaluated during the 
Study Intervention Visit

Pi[INVESTIGATOR_304012] -[ADDRESS_371927] 05 , 2017  
  
 
Pregnancy  Screening  
All women of child bearing potential, (defined as any woman, unless surgically sterile or 
postmenopausal for at least 1 year) must be instructed to contact [CONTACT_304039] i n this study. If a participant 
becomes pregnant, she will be discontinued from the study.  Pregnancy urine tests of WOCP 
will be completed at each visit prior to CT scan or usage of the VitaBreath study device.  
 
STUDY PROCEDURES  
The study will be explained  to the potential participant and sufficient time provided to the subject  to ask 
questions regarding the study. Study related procedures will commence only after the informed consent is 
signed by [CONTACT_423] . This is a multi (2 or 3)  visit study a s part of  which , participants wi ll be asked to 
complete in -lab six minute walk tests .  
 
Screening Visit /s [ADDRESS_371928] scan  (in the past year)  of the 
participant is available  and confirms eligibility . If the study participant has not had a CT  scan within  the 
past year, they will be scheduled for one by [CONTACT_464]. The participants will be asked to return for 
Screening Visit [ADDRESS_371929] scan review  at either Screening Visit  1 or if needed, Screening Visit 2, 
participants will undergo the remaining  screening procedures to ass ess study eligibility: spi[INVESTIGATOR_038] , [ADDRESS_371930] ( Standard 6MWT)29, 32 , device training/acclimation, and a dyspnea rating assessment 
(Modified Medic al Research Counsel - Appendix B)34.  
 
Participants will be asked to take their short -acting bronchodi lator medication 15 minutes prior to start of 
the 6MWT . 
 
The participant’s medical history will include an assessment of their medication use , smoking history , 
and how often they rely on their rescue medication ( at rest and with exertion ). Any participatio n in a 
Rehab ilitation Program  will be captured as well.  
 
Participants will be allowed to begin exercise asses sments [ADDRESS_371931] 05 , 2017  
 consistently ≤ 88% during the test, the test will be stopped and  the participant will be excluded. If the 
partic ipant is currently prescribed and using supplemental oxygen during the test and their oxygen level 
consistently falls ≤ 88%, supplemental oxygen will be titrated during the test by [CONTACT_304040] 90% or higher  during the test . Oxygen equipment will be available at 
the sites.  
 
We will follow the American Thoracic Society Statement Guidelines for the Six -Minute Walk Test 
which include the following criteria for im mediately stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a 6MWT: Intolerable dyspnea, leg cramps, 
staggering, diaphoresis, and pale or ashen appearance .  
 
Device Training  
 
Participants will be asked to train on the VitaBreath device to practice breathing with it.  The purpose of 
this training p eriod is to get the participant acclimated to the device  prior to using it during the modified 
6MWTs at  the Study Intervention  Visit . If the participants have trouble coordinating with the device or 
cannot tolerate the mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_304026] e nasal cavity, they will be excluded from the 
study.  
 
All participants will also be asked to practice pursed lip breathing with proper instruction and training by 
[CONTACT_6624].   
 
Randomization  
 
If the participant qualifies for the study, their device usage order ( VitaBreath  or control condition / pursed 
lip breathing ) will be randomized  using a permuted -block randomization sequence  at the study 
intervention visit . Each participant will complete two modified 6MWTs during  the Study Intervention  
Visit , one with each therapy in a randomized order .  The randomization will be stratified within each site.  
 
Sites will use a randomization schedule  in order to randomize the patient s.  
 
The Study Intervention Visit w ill be scheduled within 5±2 business day period  of Screening Visit/s .  
 
Study Intervention Visit  – Modified 6MWT   
  
During the study intervention visit, the participants will first complete the Chronic Respi[INVESTIGATOR_6004] (CRQ)33- initial (CRQ) (Appendix C).  This survey will be completed  by [CONTACT_3445] s 
before they use the device during the modified 6MWT. The response to this questionnaire will serve as a 
baseline measurement.  
 
At the Study Intervention Visit, WOCP will complete a pregnancy urine test prior to any usage of the 
VitaBreath study device.  
 
 Participants will be asked to practice breathing again with the VitaBreath device to get acclimated prior 
to using it during the modified 6MWTs at the Study Intervention Visit . Such use will be for a maximum 
time of 5 – [ADDRESS_371932] . Parti cipants will be allowed to begin asses sments 15 minutes after their 
bronchodilator administration. Concomitant medication and any adverse events will be assessed.  If 
additional uses of the bronchodilator are required by [CONTACT_304041] , that use will be 
recorded / documented. Participant’s b lood oxime try levels will be monitored via pulse oximeter  at all 
times .  
 
A medically t rained clinician  will be present during the tes t in case of adverse events.  
 
Participant s will be asked to perf orm two 6MWT assessments on  the Study Intervention  Visit. Borg 
assessments will be made prior to the start of each test.  
 
For one of the tests, participants will be give n the VitaBreath  device and the other test wil l be with 
control condition , where the p atients will be instructed to use pursed lip breathing.  The order of the se two  
tests will be randomized.  
 
Test Procedure  
 
In order to standardize the participant use of the devices, at the [ADDRESS_371933] deviation, median, minimum and maximum observation.  Data will be presented in the 
untransformed and transformed format (if applica ble) for each continuous variable.  Categorical data will 
be presented as frequencies and percentages.  
 
 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_304012] -[ADDRESS_371934] therapy for COPD participants to utili ze for  relief of  their dyspnea  after 
exertion that can consequently allow them to be more active. VitaBreath delivers intermittent non -
invasive positive pressur e (PAP) therapy  that provides positive airway pressure of 18 cm H2 O during 
inspi [INVESTIGATOR_1516]  (IPAP)  and 8 cm H 2O on expi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]  (EPAP),  with a handheld device to  COPD participants.  
 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_304012] -[ADDRESS_371935] could be uncomfortable. The 
participant can easily remove the device should it become uncomfortable or make breathing difficult. 
Other potential side effects may  include ear discomfort, and ga stric distension (aerophagia), all of which 
are quite uncommon, but generally cited side effects of PAP therapy.   
 
The EPAP and IPAP pressures delivered by [CONTACT_304042], p neumothorax or a history of bullous lung disease  (large bullae greater than 3cm in 
diameter)  to greater risk. Therefore, these participants will be excluded from the study ; per the inclusion 
criteria, patients must have n o evidence of bullous lung disease (with any bullae greater than 3cm in 
diameter ) as confirmed by a CT scan within the past one year . Additionally, severe COPD participants 
with <25% predicted FEV1 will also be excluded from the study.  
 
Computed Tomography (CT) imaging uses ionizing radiat ion to generate images of the body  but is 
conducted in the COPD population to provide detailed information regarding advancement and severity 
of the disease state. A CT scan  has risks associated with ionizing radiation exposure that could include 
potential  damage to DNA and a small increase in the possibility that a person will develop cancer later in 
life.[ADDRESS_371936] two medically trained professionals available.  
Participants are required to use their bronchodilators before exercise testings. Participants’ oxygen levels 
will be checked and monitored before, duri ng, and after the exercise test ing.  American Thoracic Society 
Statement Guidelines for the Six -Minute Walk Test include the following criteria for immediately 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a 6MWT: Intolerable dyspnea, leg cramps, staggering, diaphoresis, and pale or ashen 
appearance .  
 
POTENTIAL BENEFITS  
Although participation in this trial will not result in any direct benefit to the subject, they will be 
contributing to generalizable data that will help improve device design and function.

This clinical study will be monitored by [CONTACT_50212][INVESTIGATOR_130747]. (Sponsor) in compliance with the Code 
of Federal Regulations (CFR) for clinical research; namely, [ADDRESS_371938] of the study to assure compliance with the investigational plan, and 
to verify the completeness and  accuracy of study data.   Monitoring also aids in identifying any research -
related problems for the sponsor and/or investigator to correct.   The Sponsor will conduct monitoring 
visits with appropriately trained clinical research professionals . 
 
Monitoring will be conducted by [CONTACT_304043], Institutional Review 
Board requirements, and reporting and investigation of serious adverse events.   The site investigator will 
evaluate and classify events.   An adverse event (AE) is a situation in which the participant experiences 
illness or injury not addressed in the device labeling, research proto col, or research consent form.  All 
AEs will be recorded on the AE log provided in the site binder.  
 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is an ad verse event:  
 Resulting in death, or  
 Resulting in a serious deterioration in the health of the subject that:  
o Results in a life -threatening illness or injury,  
o Results in a permanent impairment of a body structure or body function,  
o Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31007], or  
o Results in medical or surgical intervention to prevent permanent impairment of a body 
structure or body function.  
 
Participants will report any AEs or SAEs to the research staff (i.e., investigators a nd study coordinators) 
in the course of scheduled and non -scheduled participant contacts (i.e., clinic visits, phone calls, and 
emails).   All events will be reported to the sponsor by [CONTACT_16133]; however, all SAEs must be 
reported to the sponsor wi thin 24 hours of discovering the occurrence of the SAE.   The research staff is 
required to complete and submit the sponsor’s standard SAE form detailing the event.

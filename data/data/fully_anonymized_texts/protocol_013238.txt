44(65)8.5.2 Definition of a serious adverse event
A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AEthat:
a)led to death ,
b)led to serious deterioration in the health of the subject ,thateither resulted in
1.a life -threatening2illness or injury , or
2.a permanent impairment of a bod y structure or body function , or
3.in-patient or prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_73256]3,or
4.medical or surgical intervention to prevent life-threatening illness or injury  or 
permanent impairment to a body  structure or a body  function ,
c)led to foetal distress, foetal death ,or a congenital a bnormality or birth defect
An AE does not need to be recorded as a SAE if it only represents a relapse or an expected 
change or progression of the condition that was the cause of the treatment, without the 
development of new s ymptoms and signs.
In cases of doubt ,whether an AEfulfils a serious criteri onor not, there should be a 
predisposition to report as a SAE rather than not report as such (see section 8.5.5 ).
8.5.[ADDRESS_199971] should be questioned about AEs at each study  visit following the screening visit .
The question asked should be:“Since your last clinical visit have you had any health 
problems?” Information on AEs can also be obtained from signs and symptoms detected 
during each examination.  
When an AE is related to a device deficiency  including technical device malfunction, the AE 
should be recorded in the AE eCRF and technical complaint should be reported separately  on 
the study  complaint form.  
Inves tigators, or other study  site personnel, shall record all AEs in the eCRF, including:
a)Event term (recorded in standard medical terminology  and avoiding abbreviations)
b)Description of event and affected area 
c)Start date (first day  with sy mptoms)
d)Stop date (last day  with sy mptoms)
e)Intensit y (mild, moderate, or severe according to definition in Section [IP_ADDRESS] )
f)Seriousness (serious or not serious, according to definition in Section [IP_ADDRESS] )
                                                
2The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of 
death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it 
were more severe. (Source: ICH -E2A clinical safety data management : definitions and standards for expedited 
reporting ).
3Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17450] a pre -existing condition , or a procedure required by [CONTACT_64106], without serious 
deterioration in health, is not considered a SAE. (Source: ISO14155:2011).

h)Action taken (none, medication treatment, non-medication treatment, or other 
procedures/tests, subject withdrawn)
i)Outcome of the AE(ongoing, recovered, recovered with sequelae, death, chronic/ 
stable, not recovered at the end of the stud y)
The pre-defined, expected post -treatment events shallbe assessed separately . These events 
shall be collected b y subjects in a diary  used daily  for 14 day safter the treatment .
[IP_ADDRESS] Intensity
Intensit y will be recorded f or each reported AE . The following definitions of intensity  are to 
be used:
Mild : Awareness of s ymptoms or signs, but easily  tolerated (acceptable )
Moderate: Enough discomfort to interfere with usual activity  (disturbing)
Severe: Incapacity  to work or to do usual activity  (unacceptable)
If the intensity  changes within one day , the maximum intensity  of the AEduring that day  
shallbe recorded .
[IP_ADDRESS] Causal relationship and seriousnes s
Each AE, serious as well as non -serious, shall be assessed by [CONTACT_941] I nvestigator for causal 
relationship with the study product and its us e(the injection procedure) and for seriousness
(Yes or No)of the event . 
Atwo-point scale (Yes or No response ) shall be used for the causalit y assessments . The 
Investigators shall beasked to indicate aresponse to each of the following questions in the 
eCRF :
“Do you consider that there is a reasonable possibility  that the event may  have been 
caused b y the study product ?”,and 
“Do you consider that there is a reasonable possibility  that the event may  have been 
caused b y the device injection procedure?”
If any of these questions is answered Yes, the AE is considered related .
Each AEwill also be assessed for causa l relationship and seriousness by  [CONTACT_1034] , in order 
to fulfil regulatory  requirements. 
8.5.[ADDRESS_199972] shall start at screening visit after the signature [CONTACT_170817].The reporting shall continue during each follow -up visit (including telephone contacts
and extra visits between planned visits )until the last scheduled visit in the study .
All AEs, non -serious as well as serious, are to be reported as an AEin the eCRF .
8.5.5 Reporting of serious adverse events
The Investigator shall report any  SAE to the S ponsor immediately but not later than 24 
hours of awareness of the event . This initial report can be made via e-mail.

All serious as well as non-serious AEs with a causal relationship to the study  product or 
treatment procedure and ongoing at study  end, shall be followed up after the subject's 
participation in the study is over.  Such events shall be followed -up after the last study  visit 
until resolved, or assessed as chronic or stable.  All AEs assessed as related to the study  
product or treatment procedure, serious as well as non-serious, with onset after the study  
termination (last subject study  visit), and that the Investigator becomes aware of, should be 
reported to Sponsor in accordance with the post -marketing procedure as agreed upon with the

9.Data Handling and Management 
9.1 Data management
Data management based on GCP refers to the activities defined to achieve safe routines to 
enter clinical data information into a database, efficientl y and avoiding errors. The data 
manageme nt routine include sprocedures for handling eCRFs, database set-up and 
management, data entry  and verification, data validation, and documentation of the 
performed activities including information of discrepancies in the process. The data 
management process will be described in detail in the data management plan (DMP).
The database, the data entry  screens and program will be designed in accordance with the CIP
and the eCRF. Data validation will be performed by [CONTACT_170808]. Drugs and events will be coded in accord ance with World Health Organization 
(WHO )Drug and medical dictionary  for regulatory  activities (MedDRA )dictionaries as 
specified in the DMP. SAE s in the clinical database will be reconciled against the data inthe 
safet y database.
When all efforts have been m ade to ensure that the data recorded in the eCRFs and entered in 
the database is as correct and complete as possible, the clinical database will be locked. Study
data will betransferred to SAS datasets which thereafter will bewrite-protected. Statistical
analyses will be generated in SAS using data from the locked datasets.

49(65)9.2 Electronic case report forms
A 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 11-compliant electronic data capture 
application will be used to collect, modify , maintain, archive, retrieve, and transmit study  
data.  An eCRF is required and shall be completed electronicall y for each screen failure as 
well as enrolled subje cts. 
The eCRF includes password protection and internal quality  checks, such as automatic range 
checks, to identify  data that appear inconsistent, incomplete, or inaccurate.  Study data shall 
be entered directl y from the source documents, which are to be defined at each site before 
inclusion of the first subject.
Authorized study  site personnel designated by  [CONTACT_170809]. 
Appropriate training and securit y measures shall be completed with all authorized 
investigation site personnel prior to the study  being initiated and any data being entered into 
the sy stem for any  subject.
The study  data is the sole propert y of the Sponsor and shall not be m ade available in any  form
tothird parties, except for authorized representatives of appropriate RA, without written 
permission from the Sponsor.  At the end of the study , electronic data are kept at the Sponsor 
and a cop y (provided b y the vendor) at the study  site as part of the Investigator file.
Any delegation of collection of data s hall be specified in a signature [CONTACT_77288].
9.2.[ADDRESS_199978] ’s visit. The subject’s identity  must alway s remain 
confidential, i.e. the name [CONTACT_170819]. The Investigator must verify  that all data entries in the eCRFs are accurate 
and correct. If some assessments are not done, or if certain information is not available, not 
applicable or unknown, the Investigator shallindicate this in the eCRF. The Investigator shall
electronically  sign off the study data. By [CONTACT_2960], the Investigator takes responsibility  for the 
accuracy , completeness ,and legibility  of the data reported to the Sponsor in the eCRF.
9.2.2 The query  process
The monitor shall review the eCRFs and evaluate them for completeness and consistency . 
Each eCRF shall be compared with the respective source documents to ensure that there are 
no discrepancies between critical data. All entries, corrections ,and alterations shall be made 
by [CONTACT_978][INVESTIGATOR_022]/her authorised designee. The monitor cannot enter data in the eCRFs. Once 
study data have been submitted to the central server via the eCRF, corrections to the data 
fields will be audit trailed, meaning that the reason for change, the name [CONTACT_170820], together with time and date will be logged. Roles and rights of the site 
personnel responsible for entering study data into the eCRF shall be determined in advance. 
If discrepant data is detected during review of the data, either by [CONTACT_170810] , the responsible data manager ormonitor shall raise a query  in the electronic 
data capture application. The query  shallstate the question or data to be changed and shallbe 
resolved in the system by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_022]/her authorised designee . The appropriate study site 
personnel shall answe r the queries in the eCRF. This will be audit trailed by [CONTACT_170811], time, and date is 
logged.

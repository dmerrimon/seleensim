InSite Vision, Inc.   4 1.0 STUDY OBJECTIVE(S)  
To evaluate the ocular safety, tolerability, and efficacy of topi[INVESTIGATOR_250022] -305 (0.1% 
dexamethasone in DuraSite® 2 ophthalmic solution) compared with DuraSite 2 Vehicle  when 
dosed twice daily (BID) for [ADDRESS_661173] 
surgery.  
 
2.0 STUDY DESIGN  
This study is a Phase 3, randomized, multicenter, double -masked, vehicle -controlled, parallel -
group clinical trial. Approximately 240 subjects will participate in the study and will be 
randomized in a 2:1 ratio to the ISV -305 group (160 subjects) and the vehicle group (80 subjects).  
Written informed consent will be obtained fro m all subjects prior to any study -specific procedure. 
Subjects will be enrolled into a 16 -day dosing phase, followed by a 2 -week evaluation phase. There 
will be 7 visits scheduled during the study: a screening visit between 2 and 14 days prior to surgery; 
3 visits during the dosing phase (Day 0 [Surgery Day], Day 1, and Day 8); and 3 visits during the 
evaluation phase (Day 15, Day 18, and Day 29). In addition, there will be a telephone call on Day 
-3 to remind subjects to begin dosing on Day -1, the day bef ore surgery. Subjects will instill 3 
doses prior to surgery (2 doses on Day -1, and 1 dose on Day 0 prior to surgery), [ADDRESS_661174] (IP) will be dispensed to the subject, and a second bottle will 
remain at the sit e as a precaution only in the event of loss, etc., and will not be dispensed unless 
necessary.  Throughout this protocol, the surgery eye is referred to as the study eye, and the fellow 
eye is referred to as the non -study eye.  
All ratings and procedures should be performed by [CONTACT_511204]. Additional exams may be scheduled as necessary to ensure the safety of the subjects 
during the study period.  
Subjects who terminate use of IP for an y reason will be withdrawn from the study, the reason(s) 
clearly described on the subject’s electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) and source documents, and 
the sponsor or designee will be notified.  
If the investigator determines lack of efficacy during the do sing period, administration of a rescue 
medication (i.e., another medication to treat ocular inflammation and/or ocular pain in the surgery 
eye [study eye]) must occur after subject is withdrawn from the study, and be clearly documented 
on the source docum ents and the designated eCRF.  
All adverse events (AEs), regardless of severity, will be followed throughout the study to the final 
study visit, until they resolve or resolve with sequelae (as judged by [CONTACT_093]). Ongoing 
AEs will be followed beyon d the final study visit at the discretion of the investigator and recorded 
in the source documents .

4.0 STUDY TREATMENT AND DRUG/DOSAGE ADMINIST RATION  
Subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to  1 of 2 treatment groups:  
1. ISV-305 (0.1% dexamethasone in DuraSite 2) BID (160 subjects)  
2. DuraSite 2 Vehicle BID (80 subjects)  
One drop of IP will be self -instilled by [CONTACT_423] (or instilled by [CONTACT_84452]) BID, in the surgery 
eye (study eye) for 16 days: the day prior to surgery, the day of surgery and postoperatively for 
[ADDRESS_661180] the subjects on the proper administration of their 
IP. 
Subjects (and caregiver as appropriate) will be instructed to bring the ir pain and dosing diary to 
each visit for review with site staff and for collection of diary on Day 18 (Visit 6), and to return 
all bottles of IP on Day 15 (Visit 5) for collection.  
 
5.[ADDRESS_661181] Maxidex (0.1% dexamethasone) are presented below.  
Use of ophthalmic dexamethasone is contraindicated in epi[INVESTIGATOR_250027] (dendritic 
keratitis), vacci nia, varicella, and most other viral diseases of the cornea and conjunctiva, 
tuberculosis of the eye and fungal disease of ocular structures.  
Class warnings for corticosteroids such as dexamethasone are well known and state that prolonged 
use may result i n ocular hypertension and/or glaucoma, with damage to the optic nerve, defects in 
VA and fields of vision, and posterior subcapsular cataract formation. Prolonged use may also 
suppress the host response and thus increase the hazard of secondary ocular infe ctions. In diseases 
causing thinning of the cornea or sclera, perforations have been known to occur with the use of 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_11930]. In acute purulent conditions of the eye, corticosteroids may mask infection 
or enhance existing infection. It is re commended that if corticosteroids are used for 10 days or 
longer, intraocular pressure should be routinely monitored.

6.2 Examination Procedures  
The following ophthalmic examinations will be conducted in the surgery eye (study eye) at 
intervals specified in Table 1 , The Schedule of Assessments. The fellow eye (non -study  eye) may 
be examined at the investigators’  discretion.  
 Best Corrected  Visual A cuity ( BCVA): BCVA will be measured at every visit except 
Visit 2 (Surgery; Day 0).  The Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy (ETDRS) log of the 
minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) will be used to measure BCVA.  
 Intraocular Pressure (IOP) : IOP will be meas ured at every visit except Visit 2 (Surgery; 
Day 0) in mmHg using an applanation tonometer.  
 Ophthalmoscopy : Ophthalmoscopy will be performed at Visit 1 (Day -14 to Day -2) and 
Visit 5 (Day 15) by a board -certified ophthalmologist.  
 Biomicroscopy:  Slit lamp  biomicroscopy, including the evaluation of ACC and anterior 
chamber flare (ACF), chemosis, bulbar conjunctival injection, ciliary injection, corneal 
edema, and keratic precipi[INVESTIGATOR_511198] a board -certified ophthalmologist at 
every visit exce pt Visit 2 (Surgery; Day 0).  
 Visual Analog Scale ( VAS ): Eye pain/discomfort and photophobia will be evaluated at 
every visit  except Visit 2 (Surgery; Day 0) using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS), scoring 
from 0 to 100 using a mark on a 100 mm line (0 = absent;  100 = maximum).  
 Pain assessment via diary  (Pain Diary) : Surgery eye pain will be evaluated prior to each 
IP dose using a pain scale included in the pain and dosing diary that subjects complete at 
home.

Events reported before signing the consent form should be recorded as medical history;  once the 
ICF is signed new conditions or worsening of existing conditions or epi[INVESTIGATOR_511199] e CRF.  
To standardize the collection of AEs during a study, subjects should be asked a standard question 
to elicit AEs: “Have you had any problems since your last visit or telephone call?” and “What is 
the status of [list previously reported unresolved AEs]? ” Subjects will also be instructed to contact 
[CONTACT_511207].   
Throughout the course of the study, the investigator must remain alert to possible adverse 
experiences or untoward f indings. If adverse experiences occur, the first concern will be the safety 
of the subject. Appropriate medical intervention will be provided by [CONTACT_093].

InSite Vision, Inc.   10 The collection, review and management of safety data (AEs and SAEs) will be conducted in 
compliance with the requirements of the FDA as well as the local IRB /Independent Ethics 
Committee (IEC) . 
7.[ADDRESS_661183] medical occurrence associated with the use of an IP in humans, whether 
or not considered rela ted to the I P. 
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an IP, without 
any judgment about causality. An AE can arise from any use of the  IP (e.g., off -label use, use in 
combination with another drug) and from any route of administration, formulation or dose, 
including overdose.  
Medical conditions or diseases present before a subject starts study treatment are only considered 
AEs if they worsen after the subject signs informed consent.  
Diagnostic and therapeutic non -invasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery, should not be 
reported as AEs. However, the medical condition for which the procedure was performed should 
be reported if it meets the definition of an AE. For example, an acute appendicitis that begins 
during the AE -reporting period should be reported as the AE and the resulting appendectomy noted  
according to the eCRF completion guideline . 
Adverse Event Reporting Period  
The A E reporting period for this study begins upon signing the consent form and ends at the 
completion of the subjects’ final visit exam. All AEs that occur in study subjects during the AE -
reporting period must be reported in the source documents and on the AE eCRF, whether or not 
the event is considered related to the IP. In addition, any known untoward event that occurs 
subsequent to the AE reporting period that the investigator assesses as possibly related to the IP 
should be recorded in the source documents and reported to the sponsor or designee . 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
An SAE is an  event that, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, results in any of the 
following outcomes:  
 death  
 a life-threatening  AE or sight -threatening AE, where ophthalmics are involved  
 inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
 a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions  
 a congenital anomaly/birth defect

InSite Vision, Inc.   11  an important medical event that may not result in death, be life -threatening/sight -
threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical 
or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above . Examples of such 
events are intensive treatment in emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; 
blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12191]; or development of 
drug dependency or drug abuse.  
The criterion of inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_511200], even if the subject is released on the same day. An emergency room visit does not qu alify 
as “inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” unless the subject is admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_511201]; 
however, the reason for the emergency room visit may qualify as an SAE based on another SAE 
criteria (e.g., life threatening or medically significant even t). 
Pre-existing Conditions  
In this study , a pre -existing condition is a disorder /disease  present before the AE -reporting period 
starts (i.e., prior to the subject signing the ICF) and noted on the Medi cal History eCRF.  A pre -
existing condition should not be reported as an AE unless the condition worsens or epi[INVESTIGATOR_511202] -reporting period.  
7.2 Adverse Events Associated with Study Procedures  
Visual Acuity  
A worsening of BCVA of 3 lines or more in logMAR score should be c aptured in the source 
documents and the appropriate AE eCRF.  
IOP 
An increase in IOP of ≥ 10 mmHg from Visit 1 or  any subsequent visit should be captured as an 
AE in the source documents and on the AE eCRF.  
Biomicroscopy  
Anterior chamber cell (ACC) and ACF,  chemosis, bulbar conjunctival injection, ciliary injection, 
corneal edema, and keratic precipi[INVESTIGATOR_511203]. Since the severity of these 
assessments will be recorded and carefully monitored during the study, worsenings do not need to  
be recorded as AEs unless the investigator judges it appropriate. Any treatment emergent findings 
(findings that were not present prior to dosing with IP, or a worsening relative to baseline [before 
IP dosing]) outside of these assessments should be recor ded as an AE.  
Ophthalmoscopy  
A new finding or a significant worsening (2 units or more) from baseline should be recorded as an 
AE.

7.3 Reporting and Evaluation of AEs and SAEs  
Table 2 presents  the reporting guidelines for AEs and SAEs. It is important  that the investigator 
comply with the SAE reporting timelines in order to assure that safety reporting timelines of 
IRB/IEC and regulatory authorities such as the FDA can be met.  
Table  2: Requirements for Reporting Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Event s to 
Sponsor  
Type  Reporting Time  Type of Report  
Serious  Within 24 hours  Adverse Event Report (AE eCRF)  
Serious Adverse Event Report Form  
Non-serious  Per eCRF submission procedure  Adverse Event Report (AE eCRF)  
 
All information relevant to the SAE must  be recorded on the appropriate SAE Report Form, and 
the form submitted immediately (within 24 hours of learning of the event) to the sponsor Medical 
Monitor or designee:  
The investigator must also provide sponsor or designee a copy of all pertinent medica l records 
such as source documents, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_78685], death certificates etc. that are de -identified and 
contain only the study subject number and the subject initials. The investigator should maintain a 
copy of these medical records  in his/her files, as well as any information and medical judgments 
from colleagues or other medical personnel who assisted in the treatment and follow -up of the 
subject.  
The investigator should ensure that the subject receives appropriate medical treatmen t and follow -
up. Subjects should receive follow -up until the SAE resolves or resolves with sequelae (as judged 
by [CONTACT_093]) . 
Institutional Review Board or Independent Ethics Committee  
The investigator will inform the IRB/IEC of any SAE/serious, une xpected, suspected adverse 
reaction according to the IRB/IEC’s specific reporting guidelines.  
For all serious, unexpected, suspected adverse reactions, the sponsor or designee will provide 
documentation to the investigator for the investigator’s report to the IRB/IEC or local regulatory 
authorities.  
The investigator must provide documentation of all such IRB/IEC notifications to the sponsor or 
designee. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_250032]'s files.

All AEs, regardless of severity, will be followed throughout the study t o the final study visit, until 
they resolve or resolve with sequelae  (as judged by [CONTACT_093]).   
At the final study visit, new AEs, as well as follow -up informati on for continuing AEs, will be 
recorded in the eCRF and source document. Non -serious ongoing AEs will be followed beyond 
the final study visit at the discretion of the investigator and recorded in the source documents.  
If an SAE is unresolved at the final  study visit, it will be followed by [CONTACT_250037] (as judged by [CONTACT_093]). Follow -up data for such SAEs 
will be recorded in the source document and reported to the sponsor or designee . 
Subjects withdr awn from the study due to an  AE or SAE  will be followed by [CONTACT_511208] (resolved or resolved with sequelae) and, where appropriate, additional 
written reports and documentation will be provided  to the sponsor .

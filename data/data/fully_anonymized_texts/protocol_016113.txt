Measures Taken to Reduce Bias:  Randomization will be used to avoid bias 
in the assignment of subjects to test article, 
to increase the likelihood that known and 
unknown subject attributes (e.g., 
demographics and baseline characteristics) 
are evenly balanced across treatment 
groups, and to enhance the validity of 
statistical comparisons across treatment 
groups. Str atification will be used to 
balance treatment assignments within key 
subgroups. Masked treatment will be used 
to reduce the potential of bias during data 
collection and evaluation of clinical 
endpoints.  
Study Population Characteristics:  
Number of Subjects:  Approximately 500 subjects will be 
screened to enroll approximately 200

NTRODUCTION  
Dry eye disease (DED) is a complex and chronic condition characterized by [CONTACT_537413], visual disturbance, tear film instability, increased tear osmolarity, and 
inflammation of the ocular surface that, in severe cases, can lead to loss of vision ( Dry 
Eye Workshop 2007) . Although estimates of the prevalence of dry eye disease vary 
considerably depending on the criteria used to define the disease, as many as 3.[ADDRESS_699915] DED in the United 
States, and prevalence is projected to increase by 40% by 2030 as a result of population 
aging and increasing computer use ( Schaumberg 20 02, Schaumberg 2003 , Schaumberg 
2009, Brewitt 2001).  
R
eactive aldehyde species (RASP) are reactive organic molecules that bind to proteins, 
carbohydrates, lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], and nucleic acids ( Esterbauer 1991 ).  RASP  that are not 
se
questered or otherwise protected i n specific metabolic processes are toxic, and 
aldehyde binding to cellular constituents leads to inflammation via activation of NF B 
and other pro -inflammatory mediators ( Yadav 2013 ), molecular dysfunction (O'Brien 
2005
), and the accumulation of indigestib le metabolites, such as lipofuscin components 
in the retina ( Boyer 2012 ).   
In biological systems, RASP are formed by a variety of processes, including the 
oxidation of alcohols, polyamine and glucose metabolism, and oxidative stress.  In non-
disease states, levels of RASP are low due to the near ubiquitous presence of aldehyde 
dehydrogenases and other enzymes that catabolize aldehydes.  However, in disease states, 
the capacity of aldehyde dehydrogenases to neutralize toxic aldehydes is exceeded, 
resulting in increased RASP levels. Elevation in the levels of RASP, particularly 
malonyldialdehyde (MDA), has been described in a variety of inflammatory ocular 
diseases, including pterygium, Behcet's Disease, Sjögren’s Syndrome, anterior uveitis, 
and dry eye disea se (Sandikci 2003 , Cejkova 2007 , Balci 2011, Turk 2014 , Choi 2016 , 
Augustin 1995 ). 
Reproxalap is a novel small molecule, formulated for  topi[INVESTIGATOR_537399], that 
func
tions as a RASP sequestering agent, or “trap,” which binds rapi[INVESTIGATOR_537400]. By [CONTACT_537414][INVESTIGATOR_537401], reproxalap is expected to diminish inflammation 
thought to be caused or exacerbated by [CONTACT_537415].  Reproxalap  has demonstrated anti -infl ammatory effects in numerous ocular 
and non- ocular preclinical models of inflammation:  
 I n a rat model of lipopolysaccharide ( LPS) -induced uveitis, topi[INVESTIGATOR_537402] o f reproxalap  significantly reduced inflammatory ocular effects and 
significantly reduced ocular levels of two pro -inflammatory cytokines.   
 I n a rabbit ocular healing study, topi[INVESTIGATOR_537403].  
 I n a model of LPS -induced systemic inflammation, a single intraperitoneal 
(IP) dose of reproxalap led to a significant reduction in levels of several pro -

mmatory cytokines, while also increasing levels of the anti-inflammatory 
cytokine IL-10. 
 I n a phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate-induced mouse model of contact 
[CONTACT_537416], IP administration of reproxalap significantly reduced edema. 
 I n an oxazolone-induced, delayed-type hypersensitivity mouse model, IP 
administration of reproxalap significantly reduced edema and resulted in 
statistically significant reduction of tissue cytokines at the site of 
inflammation. 
 I n a mouse model of lung inflammation, IP administration of reproxalap 
reduced infiltratio n of inflammatory cells and protein in the lung, and resulted 
in reductions in levels of pro -inflammatory cytokines.  
 I n a model of radiation-induced mucositis in hamsters, subcutaneous 
administration of reproxalap  significantly improved healing time and r e duced 
fibrosis (scarring).  
In 1995, Augustin et al. ( Augustin 1995 ) described elevations in tear MDA levels that 
correlated with severity in DED patients. Subsequently, Choi et al. ( Choi 2016 ) reported 
that expression of MDA and 4-hydroxynonenal (another RASP commonly associated 
with inflammation) is increased in the tear film and ocular surface of patients with DED. 
Consistent with the literature that supports the notion that RASP mediate pro-
inflammatory toxicity in DED, the anti-inflammatory effects of the RASP scavenger 
reproxalap have been demonstrated in Phase [ADDRESS_699916], in various strengths, has completed a Phase 1 clinical 
trial, as well as a vehicle-controlled, double-masked Phase 2a clinical trial in allergic 
conjunctivitis; a vehicle-controlled, double-masked Phase 2b clinical trial in allergic 
conjunctivitis; a comparator-controlled, investigator-masked Phase 2 clinical trial in 
noninfectious anterior uveitis; a vehicle-controlled, double-masked Phase 2a clinical trial 
in DED; and a vehicle-controlled, double-masked Phase 2b clinical trial in DED.  Phase [ADDRESS_699917] been exposed to topi[INVESTIGATOR_537404].  
In all clinical trials, no treatment-related serious adverse events (SAE) have been 
observed.  Generally mild to moderate transient ocular stinging, lasting only up to a few

2.1
 Minim
ization of Risk  
In clinical trials with reproxalap topi[INVESTIGATOR_537405], no safety signal or treatment-related SAE’s have been observed 
(Section 2).  Generally mild to moderate transient ocular discomfort and ocular stinging, 
lasting
 only up to a few minutes, was the most frequently reported AE.  
In addition, extensive in vitro and in vivo studies conducted to assess the safety, efficacy, 
and pharmacokinetics of reproxalap have shown that reproxalap is effective in animal 
models of inflammation, is not toxic to the eye, and can achieve therapeutically relevant 
concentrations in the eye. Nonclinical safety and toxicology studies of reproxalap

multiples of those expected in planned clinical trials. In aggregate, the nonclinical studies 
completed to date provide compelling evidence that reproxalap has the potential to 
ameliorate pathologic ocular inflammation without off-target pharmacological or toxic 
effects. The excipi[INVESTIGATOR_537406]

Reproxalap Ophthalmic Solution  Aldeyra Therapeutics, Inc.  
Clinical Trial Protocol: ADX-102-DED-[ADDRESS_699928] medical occurrence associated with the use of an IP in 
humans, whether or not considered IP-related. An AE can be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of an IP, without any judgment about causality. An AE can arise 
fr
om any use of the IP (e.g., off-label use, use in combination with another drug or 
medical device) and from any route of administration, formulation, or dose, including an 
overdose. An AE can arise from any delivery, implantation, or use of a medical device, 
including medical device failure, subject characteristics that may impact medical device 
performance (e.g., anatomical limitations), and therapeutic parameters (e.g., energy 
applied, sizing, dose release, and anatomic fit) associated with medical device use. 
All AEs spont
aneously reported by [CONTACT_3184]/or in response to an open question 
from study personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_4171], physical examination or other 
diagnostic procedures will be recorded in the source document and on the appropriate 
pages of the CRF. Any clinically relevant deterioration in clinical finding is considered 
an AE and must be recorded. When possible, signs and symptoms indicating a common 
underlying pathology should be noted as one comprehensive event. 
Documentation regarding the AE should be made as to the nature, date of onset, end date, 
severity, relationship to IP, action(s) taken, seriousness, and outcome of any sign or 
symptom observed by [CONTACT_72078]. 
Exacerbation of conditions related to the signs and symptoms of Dry Eye will not be 
reported as an AE. 
10.1.1 Severity 
Severity of an AE is defined as a qualitative assessment of the degree of intensity of an 
AE as determined by [CONTACT_72079]/her by [CONTACT_423]. The 
assessment of severity is made irrespective of relationship to IP or seriousness of the 
event and should be evaluated according to the following scale: 
  
 
  
 
  
 
10.1.[ADDRESS_699929] use information about the 
conditions/concurrent medication, and chronology of the event relative to drug 
administration.  The following definitions will be used:

finitely Related 
 Probably Related 
 Possibly Related 
 Unlikely to be related 
 Not R
elated 
 
10.1.3 Expectedness 
The expectedness of an AE should be determined based upon existing safety information 
about the IP using these explanations: 
 Unexpected: An AE that is not listed in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) or is not 
listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed. 
 E
xpected:  An AE that is listed in the IB at the specificity and severity that has been 
obse
rved. 
 Not appli
cable: An AE unrelated to the IP. 
AE events that are mentioned in the IB as occurring with a class of products or as 
anticipated from the pharmacological/mechanical (or other) properties of the product, but 
are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular product under 
investigation are to be considered unexpected. 
The investigator should initially classify the expectedness of an AE, but the final 
classification is subject to the Medical Monitor’s determination. 
10.2 Serious Adverse Events  
An AE is considered serious if, in the view of either the investigator or Sponsor, it results 
in any of the following outcomes: 
 Death; 
 A life-threatening AE; 
Note: An AE is considered “life-threatening” if, in the view of either the investigator or 
Sponsor, its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of death. It does not include 
an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. 
 Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]; 
Note: The term “inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” refers to any inpatient admission (even if less 
than 24 hour
s). For chronic or long-term inpatients, inpatient admission includes transfer 
within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4591]/intensive care inpatient unit. Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_241525]: emergency room visits; outpatient/same-day/ambulatory procedures; 
observation/short stay units; rehabilitation facilities; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4593]; nursing homes; or 
clinical research/phase 1 units.

: The term “prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” refers to any extension of an 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_241526]. 
 A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions; 
Note: A serious adverse event (SAE) specifically related to visual threat would be 
interpreted as any potential impairment or damage to the subject’s eyes (e.g., 
hemorrhage, retinal detachment, central corneal ulcer or damage to the optic nerve). 
 A congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
 Important medical events that may not result in death, are life-threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or

required by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC, federal, state, or local regulations and governing health 
authorities and recorded on the appropriate CRF. Adverse Events will be collected after 
the signing of the Informed Consent.  
10.3.1 Reporting a Suspected Unexpected Adverse Reaction 
All AEs that are ‘suspected’ and ‘unexpected’ are to be reported to Ora, the Sponsor and 
the 
IRB/IEC as required by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC, federal, state, or local regulations and 
governing health authorities. 
10.3.[ADDRESS_699931] be recorded on the 
appropriate CRFs. The investigator is obligated to pursue and obtain information 
requested by [CONTACT_241531]/or the Sponsor in addition to that information reported on the CRF. 
All subjects experiencing a SAE must be followed up and the outcome reported. 
In the event of a SAE, the investigator must notify Ora and the Sponsor immediately; 
obtain and maintain in his/her files all pertinent medical records, information, and 
medical judgments from colleagues who assisted in the treatment and follow-up of the 
subject; provide Ora and the Sponsor with a complete case history, which includes a 
statement as to whether the event was or was not suspected to be related to the use of the 
IP; and inform the IRB/IEC of the SAE within their guidelines for reporting SAEs.

10.4 Procedures for Unmasking (if applicable)  
All subjects, investigators, and study personnel involved with the conduct of the study 
will be masked with regard to study drug treatment assignments. When medically 
necessary, the investigator may need to determine what treatment has been assigned to a 
subject. When possible (i.e., in non-emergent situations), Ora and/or the Sponsor should 
be notified before unmasking IP. Ora and/or the study Sponsor must be informed 
immediately about any unmasking event. 
If an investigator identifies a medical need for unmasking the treatment assignment of a 
subject, he/she should contact [CONTACT_241531]/or the medical monitor prior to unmasking the 
identity of the IP, if possible. Ora will ask the site to complete and send them the 
Unmasking Request Form. Ora will notify Aldeyra and jointly will determine if the 
unmasking
 request should be granted. They may consult the medical monitor as needed. 
The result of the request will be documented on the Unmasking Request Form. If 
approval is granted to unmask a subject, written permission via the Unmasking Request 
Form will be provided to the investigator. The investigator will unmask the subject using 
IWRS. The investigator will complete the Unmasking Memo form and include it in the 
subject’s study file and provide a copy for the TMF. For each unmasked request, the 
reason, date, signature, and name [CONTACT_72088], must be noted 
in the subject’s study file.  
Unmasked subjects will be discontinued from the study.

 Sample Size  
Ba
sed on the results of a Phase 2b clinical trial of reproxalap in dry eye disease subjects 
(ADX-102-DED-009), for the outcome measurements of ocular dryness VAS score and 
nasal fluorescein staining, approximately 100 subjects per randomized arm will be 
evaluated in ADX-102-DED-013. Sample size estimates were made assuming an alpha of 
0.05 and power of 90% for the two efficacy populations, one with baseline staining 
severity of 2 units or more and the other with dryness score severity of 3 units or more.  
Using PASS (software version 14, NCSS, LLC), the sample size estimated for staining 
was 39 per treatment arm (78 total); the sample size estimated for dryness score was 54 
per treatment arm (108 total).  
11.4 Statistical Analysis  
11.4.1 General Considerations 
Quantitative variables will be summarized descriptively using number of subjects (n), 
mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum.  Qualitative variables will 
be summarized using counts and percentages. 
All summaries will be presented by [CONTACT_1570].  Summaries will be provided for 
demographics, baseline medical history, concurrent therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and subject disposition. 
For the purpose of summarization, medical history, concurrent therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and adverse 
e
vents will be coded to MedDRA and WHO Drug dictionaries, as appropriate.  
 
Baseline measures are defined as the last non-missing measure prior to the initiation of 
randomized study treatment at Day 1.  Change from baseline will be calculated as follow-
up vis
it value minus baseline value.  Treatment comparisons between active and vehicle 
will be matched by [CONTACT_537418]. 
 
All analyses will be 2-sided at a significance level of 0.05. 95% confidence intervals will 
be provided where appropriate.

 statistical analysis plan (SAP) will serve as the final determinant of the statistical 
procedures, notwithstanding anything herein. 
11.4.2 Unit of Analysis 
Safety endpoints will be analyzed for both eyes.  For efficacy endpoints, the unit of 
analysis will be the study eye, or the “worst eye,” as defined by [CONTACT_716]:  
 
 
 
    
 
11.4.3 Missing Data 
The primary analyses using MMRM method will be performed on the ITTOD and 
ITTF SN population with observed data only.  Efficacy analyses may also be conducted 
using
 the ITT, ITTOD, and ITTF SN populations with multiple imputation under missing 
a
t random (MAR) and missing not at random (MNAR) assumptions. P er- protocol 
population analysis may also be conducted to assess sensitivity. Further detail will be 
de
scribed in the SAP. 
11.4.4 Multiplicity Considerations 
A sequential (closed) testing procedure will be used to control the overall Type I error 
rate due to multiple comparisons for the primary, key secondary and secondary endpoint 
of fluorescein nasal staining score. The order of treatment comparisons is as follows:

 Confidential Page 56 of 81 11.4.9 Safety Variables 
Adverse events will be coded using the MedDRA dictionary. 
Frequencies and percentages will be provided per treatment group of subjects with 
treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), serious TEAEs, and TEAEs causing 
premature discontinuation. An adverse event is treatment-emergent if it occurs or worsens 
after the first dose of randomized study treatment. Furthermore, frequencies will be given 
of subjects with TEAEs by [CONTACT_9313], by [CONTACT_6657], 
by [CONTACT_9313], preferred term and maximal severity, by [CONTACT_9313], 
preferred term and strongest relationship, and by [CONTACT_9313], preferred term, 
maximal severity, and strongest relationship. Separate analyses will be performed for 
ocular specific and all adverse events (including systemic). 
Other safety endpoints including visual acuity, slit lamp biomicroscopy, intraocular 
pressure (IOP), tear osmolarity and dilated fundoscopy will be summarized by [CONTACT_514544].  Changes or shifts from baseline will also be 
summarized where appropriate.  For assessments performed by [CONTACT_72067], worst eye (study eye) 
a
nd fellow eye will be summarized separately. 
[ADDRESS_699935] Informed Consent 
Informed consent/assent must take place before any study specific procedures are 
initiated. Signed and dated written informed consent must be obtained from each subject 
and/or from the subject’s parent or legal guardian prior to enrollment into the study. If the 
subject is under the legal age of consent, the consent form must be signed by a legal 
guardian or as required by [CONTACT_52925]/or local laws and regulations. 
All informed consent/assent forms must be approved for use by [CONTACT_63044]/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_116892]/IEC prior to their use. If the consent form

Objective 
The primary objective of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) was to evaluate the 
effectiveness of the SkillFlix for Autistic Young Adults resource in improving communication skills. The study aimed to determine whether SkillFlix, a video -based intervent ion, 
enhances social skill acquisition in autistic young adults compared to a control condition 
using a text -based informational website.  
Study Design and Methods 
The study followed a two -group, pre -post evaluation design, with participants randomized 
into either the SkillFlix intervention group or the control group. Stratiﬁed randomization was 
employed based on diagnostic status and employment/education status to ensure 
balanced allocation. The study included three evaluation time points: p re-test, one -month 
post -test, and three -month post -test.  
Recruitment Strategy  
Participants were recruited via multiple channels, including targeted social media 
campaigns on Instagram, Facebook, and LinkedIn, as well as partnerships with autism service providers and professional networks. To enhance outreach, paid "boosted" posts 
were used on Instagram, which effectively increased engagement but also attracted 
fraudulent applications. To mitigate this, staff implemented a thorough screening process, 
including IP address veriﬁcation, VoIP phone number checks, remote screening calls, and 
enrollment interviews to conﬁrm eligibility and consent understanding. 
We recruited young adults, aged [ADDRESS_346591] access to the 
internet and a device (a smart phone, tablet, or computer) to participate in study activities 
on. They were also required to meet minimum requirements for participation, common to 
studies that require high levels of communication with ASD participants. This included 
reciprocal communication skills and receptive language skills.  
The study successfully enrolled 115 participants, surpassing the enrollment goal. Attrition resulted in 100 participants completing all study activities.  
Study Instrument Development  
The evaluation process incorporated multiple instruments and protocols, including: 
• Online surveys at pre -test, one -month post -test, and three -month post -test 
administered via Alchemer.  
• Standardized roleplay protocols assessing three communication skills: addressing a conﬂict, giving feedback, and coming to a compromise. Each skill was tested using 
three different scripted scenarios designed with extensive branching logic to allow 
for diverse participant responses. These roleplays were coded using a  validated 
rubric for skill evaluation, with each skill divided into 6 -8 steps and scored on a 0 -10 
scale based on behavioral criteria. 
• A tracking system to monitor participant engagement with the SkillFlix resource or 
the control website.  
Study Implementation and Data Collection  
Upon enrollment, participants scheduled their initial roleplay via Microsoft Bookings, selecting from ﬁve trained facilitators. Roleplays were conducted via Microsoft Teams and 
included an introductory explanation, a practice scenario, and three scripted scenarios 
based on real -life communication challenges. Roleplay sessions lasted [ADDRESS_346592] roleplay, participants completed an online survey before randomization into the treatment or control group. The treatment group received immediate access to SkillFlix, while the control group accessed a website with written content unre lated to the 
evaluated skills. Participants engaged with their assigned resource for 30 days before completing a second roleplay and survey, followed by a ﬁnal roleplay and survey after an additional 90 -day resource access period. A total of 322 standardi zed roleplays were 
conducted.  
Roleplay Coding and Data Analysis 
Recorded roleplays were coded for skill demonstration by a trained coding team. The rubric 
was developed and reﬁned by [CONTACT_458] (PI), project director (PD), and evaluation lead to ensure consistent scoring. Coders underwent training sessions, achieved an 80% inter -rater reliability rate, and independently coded the roleplays.

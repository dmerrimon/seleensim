Objectives : 
Primary: 
•To compare the progression-free survival (PFS) of subjects with refractory advanced renal cell carcinoma 
(RCC) randomized to treatment with tivozanib hydrochloride (tivozanib) or sorafenib as assessed by 
[CONTACT_703586] (IRR) of computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI). 
Secondary: 
•To compare the overall survival (OS) of subjects randomized to treatment with tivozanib or sorafenib

Reference therapy, dosage and mode of administration:
Sorafenib:  400 mg orally twice daily  
Subjects will receive 400 mg sorafenib twice daily continuously, beginning on Day 1.  One cycle will be defined as 
4 weeks of treatment.  Cycles will be repeated every 4 weeks.  
Dose reduction: 
Tivozanib:  Dose reduction will be allowed for subjects with ≥ Grade [ADDRESS_955392] be treated with anti-hypertensive drugs prior to dose reduction.   
The dose of tivozanib may be reduced to 1.0 mg/day.  If a subject is unable to tolerate a dose of 1.0 mg/day due to 
toxicities thought to be related to tivozanib, treatment should be interrupted for up to 4 weeks.  Once the dose of 
tivozanib is reduced, it may not be re-escalated throughout the study.   
Sorafenib:  Dose reduction will be allowed for subjects with ≥ Grade [ADDRESS_955393] is unable to tolerate a dose of 400 mg once every other day due to 
toxicities thought to be related to sorafenib, treatment should be interrupted.  If toxicities resolve to ≤ Grade 1, the 
dose of sorafenib may be re-escalated to the previous dose level at the discretion of the investigator. 
Dose interruption (tivozanib and/or sorafenib):    
Subjects with Grade [ADDRESS_955394] their treatment interrupted to allow for adequate resolution of the toxicity.  
Tivozanib/sorafenib may be interrupted for up to [ADDRESS_955395] is able to resume treatment after interruption 
of ≤ 4 weeks, missed doses will not be made up (ie, cycle duration will remain unchanged).  If any drug-related 
toxicity results in interruption of > [ADDRESS_955396]’s 
condition in order to resume treatment.  Subjects removed from treatment for reasons other than radiological 
evidence of progressive disease should still be followed with regular tumor assessments until disease progression is 
confirmed by [CONTACT_703590], and for survival thereafter.   
Criteria for evaluation: 
Safety:   
NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE Version 4.03) will be used for grading toxicities.  
Subjects will be monitored throughout the treatment and 30-day follow-up period for occurrence of adverse events 
(AEs; acute, delayed, and/or cumulative), as well as for changes in clinical status, vital sign measurements, and 
laboratory data.  
Safety parameters to be measured / assessed include eligibility assessment, medical history, vital sign measurements,

physical examination, hematology, serum chemistries, thyroid function tests, coagulation parameters, urinalysis, 
pregnancy test, ECOG performance status, and electrocardiogram (ECG).   
Disease status:   
Data on the duration of disease stabilization or any objective response, as well as the time to disease progression will 
be collected for all subjects.  Disease parameters to be assessed: 
•Disease classification (histological/cytological type and stage of carcinoma) 
•Diagnostic imaging with measurement of target lesions performed by [CONTACT_393035] 
•Response assessment using RECIST (Version 1.1) criteria 
•Radiology studies (CT scan or MRI) will be performed every 8 weeks following Cycle 1, Day 1 for 
assessing disease status 
Duration of treatment:    
Subjects with documented stable disease or an objective response may continue to receive therapy at the same dose 
and schedule until progression as long as tolerability is acceptable.   
Discontinuation:   
Subjects experiencing unacceptable toxicities will be discontinued from further study treatment.  Subjects with 
radiological evidence of progressive disease per investigator/local radiology assessment should continue treatment 
until progressive disease is verified by [CONTACT_296461].  Images should be submitted for independent 
review as soon as possible (see Imaging Manual for specific instructions).  Verification is not required in the 
following circumstance: 
•Significant clinical deterioration that is indicative of progressive disease 
Subjects who have documented disease progression will be discontinued from the study treatment.   
Follow-up:   
Each subject will be followed until death from any cause (unless the subject is lost to follow-up, withdraws consent 
for the entire study, or the Sponsor terminates the study early). Once discontinued from study drug treatment, all 
subjects are to be followed for evidence of new onset of adverse events, and to ensure resolution or stabilization of 
existing ongoing adverse events, for [ADDRESS_955398] long-term survival data.   
Statistical methods:   
A sample size of 322 subjects (161 subjects per treatment arm) with total number of 255 events will provide 90% 
power to detect a statistically significant difference between treatment arms with respect to PFS as assessed by [CONTACT_612772]: AV-951-15-[ADDRESS_955399]-2018

IRR.  The sample size was determined based on the following assumptions: 
•The distribution of the PFS for the [ADDRESS_955400] with a 
two-sided 5% significance level (α) 
•The median PFS for subjects receiving sorafenib and tivozanib is 4 months and 6 months, respectively, 
(an increase of 2 months or 50%) 
•Equal numbers of subjects will be assigned to each treatment arm 
•Enrollment will take 15 months 
•The drop out percentage per treatment arm will be 3% 
Data will be summarized using descriptive statistics (number of subjects, mean, median, standard deviation, 
minimum, and maximum) for continuous variables and using frequency and percentages for discrete variables.   
The primary analysis will compare the distribution of the PFS between the two treatment arms by [CONTACT_703591]-rank test, in which the stratification factors are IMDC risk category (favorable; intermediate; poor) and prior 
therapy (two prior VEGF TKIs; a prior checkpoint inhibitor [PD-1 or PD1-L inhibitor] plus a prior VEGFR TKI; a 
prior VEGFR TKI plus any other systemic agent).  PFS will be based on the CT or MRI scan assessed by [CONTACT_453309].  
PFS graphs will be presented by [CONTACT_2939]. 
The first secondary analysis will compare OS between the [ADDRESS_955401], the 
stratification factors included in the primary analysis, and two-sided 0.8% significance level (utilizing a Lan-DeMets 
alpha spending function with an O’Brien-Fleming boundary).  An interim OS analysis will be done at the time of the 
final PFS analysis.  It is expected that [ADDRESS_955402] been observed.  The interim analysis will look into 
the study’s futility using PFS as the efficacy evaluation endpoint.  This will utilize a Lan-DeMets error spending-
type function with an O’Brien-Fleming stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_703553]-sided beta (Type II error) of 1.2 % 
spent during this interim look.  The interim analysis will be performed by [CONTACT_55467].  The 
independent statistician will evaluate and interpret the results of the interim analysis and will provide corresponding 
recommendation whether to stop the study for futility or for the study to continue until end of study condition has 
been met. 
Two populations will be defined for the efficacy analysis:  Intent-to-treat (ITT; defined as all subjects who were 
randomized into the study) and per protocol (PP; defined as all subjects in the ITT population who did not have 
major protocol deviations, have received at least two cycles (8 weeks) of protocol treatment, and met all eligibility 
criteria).  Primary efficacy analysis will be based on ITT where subjects will be analyzed as randomized. 
The safety population (SAF) will include all subjects who received at least one dose of either study drug.  Subjects 
will be analyzed as treated.

Confidential Property of AVEO Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 3 INTRODUCTION   
Tivozanib hydrochloride (tivozanib; previously known as AV-951 and as KRN951) has the 
chemical name (N-{2-Chloro-4-[(6,7-dimethoxy-4-quinolyl)oxy]phenyl}-N'-(5-methyl-3-
isoxazolyl)urea hydrochloride monohydrate.  Tivozanib is a novel and potent vascular 
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (VEGFR TKI) that has 
demonstrated significant anti-tumor effects in pre-clinical experiments [1].  Tivozanib inhibits 
phosphorylation of VEGF receptors (VEGFR) -1, -2 and -3 at pi[INVESTIGATOR_167579] (IC 50
of 0.21, 0.16 and 0.24 nM respectively), and inhibits c-Kit and platelet derived growth factor 
receptor (PDGFR) at 10-times higher concentrations (IC 50 of 1.63 and 1.72 nM respectively).   
Based on its biochemical profile, tivozanib appears to be one of the most potent and selective 
VEGF tyrosine kinase inhibitor in clinical development.  Other agents used for treatment of 
renal cell carcinoma (RCC) such as sunitinib and sorafenib inhibit multiple tyrosine kinases in 
addition to the VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase, leading to off-target toxicities such as fatigue, 
hand-foot syndrome, stomatitis, and neutropenia.  The adverse event (AE) profile of tivozanib 
demonstrates that it is a selective VEGF tyrosine kinase inhibitor, with minimal off-target 
toxicities.  
3.1 Background 
Approximately 208,500 new cases of kidney cancer are diagnosed in the world each year, of 
which 40,000 new cases are diagnosed in North America and 63,300 new cases in the 
European Union (EU).  Renal cell carcinoma accounts for 80%-85% of all malignant kidney 
tumors.  Advanced RCC is highly resistant to chemotherapy, and interleukin-[ADDRESS_955427] of care for the treatment of subjects with advanced RCC. 
The formation of new blood vessels, known as angiogenesis, is required to support growth in 
the embryo and to allow for repair (eg, wound healing and remodeling processes in the adult) 
[2].  Vascular endothelial growth factor plays a critical role during normal embryonic 
angiogenesis and also in the pathological angiogenesis that occurs in a number of diseases, 
including cancer [3,4].  Tumors use this vasculature to obtain oxygen and nutrients, both of 
which are required to sustain tumor growth.  In addition, the new intra-tumoral blood vessels 
provide a way for tumor cells to enter the circulation and to metastasize to distant organs [5].  
The various forms of VEGF bind to 3 tyrosine kinase receptors:  the vascular endothelial 
growth factor receptors, VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, and VEGFR-3 retrospectively.  This binding 
results in phosphorylation of the receptors catalyzed by [CONTACT_703594], and the promotion 
of a signal transduction cascade.  Deregulation of VEGF expression contributes to the 
progression and spread of solid tumors by [CONTACT_703595] [6].  Tivozanib 
inhibits VEGFR-associated tyrosine kinase activity and, as a result, may offer a potential 
therapy for subjects with cancer by [CONTACT_703596]. 
3.2 Pharmacology  
In cellular assays, tivozanib has been shown to inhibit markedly VEGF-induced 
phosphorylation of intracellular VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, and VEGFR-3 (IC 50 of 0.21 nmol/L, 
Protocol: AV-951-15-303 28-Sep-2018 
Version 4.0 
Page 25 of 110 
Confidential Property of AVEO Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 0.16 nmol/L, and 0.24 nmol/L, respectively).  Tivozanib, administered orally at 5 and 
20 mg/kg once daily for [ADDRESS_955428] spectrum of anti-tumor effects.  
Tivozanib given orally at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg once daily for 2 weeks showed statistically 
significant inhibitory effects (P<0.05) on the growth of various tumor xenografts [1].  
Tivozanib at a dose of 1.0 mg/kg exerted tumor regression on human breast adenocarcinoma 
MDA-MB231, human colon adenocarcinoma LoVo, human renal carcinoma Caki-1, and 
human prostate carcinoma DU145 xenografts. 
Tivozanib has been shown to inhibit both angiogenesis and vascular permeability in tumor 
tissues.  Immunostaining of endothelial cells of tumor tissues in a human lung carcinoma 
A549 xenograft demonstrated a dose-dependent decrease in microvessel density in tumor 
tissues after oral administration of tivozanib (0.04, 0.2, and 1.0 mg/kg) once daily over 
[ADDRESS_955429]-dose period after receiving a single oral dose of 0.3, 
3, 30, or 400 mg/kg tivozanib compared to vehicle-treated animals.  In a telemetry study in 
monkeys, doses of 0.015 or 0.3 mg/kg tivozanib were shown to have no significant effects on 
arterial blood pressure; however, increasing this dose to 3.0 mg/kg resulted in transient 
increases in systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressure by [CONTACT_8622] 14–[ADDRESS_955430] been conducted in rats and monkeys.  In a 28-day 
rat study of 0.3 and 0.1 mg/kg/day, the 0.1 mg/kg/day dose was considered to be the no 
observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) in the rat as based on clinical signs, laboratory 
findings, and histopathological changes.  In a 28-day repeat-dose study in monkeys, 
0.230-0.3 mg/kg/day was considered to be the NOAEL based on clinical signs, laboratory 
findings, and histopathological changes. 
In a 13-week, repeated-dose study in the rat at dosages of 0.01, 0.03, 0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg/day, 
exposure to tivozanib at 0.3 mg/kg/day resulted in 3 male and 2 female unscheduled deaths 
considered to be drug related.  The cause of death was microscopi[INVESTIGATOR_703554]/degeneration in these rats.  Administration of 0.1 mg/kg/day tivozanib was 
associated with abnormal clinical signs, such as hunched appearance, thin appearance, rough 
hair coat, yellow hair coat, white teeth, and malocclusion.  Marked body weight loss

Confidential Property of AVEO Pharmaceuticals, Inc. accompanied by [CONTACT_703597] 0.3 mg/kg/day.  
Hematological investigations revealed lower relative and absolute reticulocyte counts in most 
0.3 mg/kg/day rats, which may represent a transient effect of tivozanib.  The mean cell 
volume (MCV) and mean cell hemoglobin (MCH) were also elevated, and there were higher 
white blood cell, lymphocyte, neutrophil, and monocyte counts in the 0.3 mg/kg/day rats.  In 
blood chemistry investigation, treatment-associated changes were noted in alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT), bile acids, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), iron metabolism 
parameters, and serum iron.  Histopathological examination of tissues showed abnormalities 
in the adrenal grand, kidney, femur, liver and bile ducts, and incisors.  Pronounced changes 
considered secondary to bile duct inflammation were seen in the pancreas and duodenum.  
Most findings resolved or showed signs of ongoing reversal after the withdrawal of treatment.  
However, kidney lesions were not resolved at either recovery or sacrifice.  Based on these 
findings, mechanistic studies were conducted to better understand the adverse effect on the 
kidney.  In conclusion, based on all study findings, the no-observable effect level (NOEL) was 
less than 0.01 mg/kg/day.  Based on body weight effects in females, the NOAEL was 
0.01 mg/kg/day.  Some tivozanib-related effects persisted through the end of the recovery 
periods, and many were seen to a much lesser degree.   
In the 13-week repeat dose monkey study at doses of 0.01, 0.03, 0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg/day, no 
mortality occurred.  Clinical observations of dehydration; hunched posture; thin appearance; 
hypoactivity; discolored, few/no and/or non-formed feces; low/no food consumption and/or 
body weight loss were seen at 1.0 mg/kg/day.  Low/no food consumption and/or body weight 
loss were observed at 0.3 mg/kg/day, and an increased frequency of low/no food consumption 
was also noted at 0.1 mg/kg/day.  Findings were generally unremarkable during recovery.  No 
tivozanib effects were observed in ophthalmic and electrocardiogram (ECG) examination.  
There were no toxicologically significant changes in hematology, serum and urine chemistry, 
and urinalysis data during treatment or recovery.  Tivozanib-related histopathological 
alterations at 1.0 mg/kg/day consisted of gastroenteropathy; decreased pancreatic zymogen 
granules; atrophy of the primary spongiosa and hypertrophy of the physis in the distal femur 
and tibia; hypertrophy of femoral articular cartilage; degeneration of the adrenal cortex; 
mononuclear infiltrates, thrombi, hemorrhage, and pi[INVESTIGATOR_703555]; and lymphoid depletion of lymphoid organs (spleen, thymus, lymph 
nodes).  Tivozanib-related histopathological alterations observed primarily at 0.3 mg/kg/day 
and in a few 0.1 mg/kg/day monkeys consisted of mononuclear cell infiltrates in the choroid 
plexus of the brain; adrenal cortical degeneration (increased cytoplasmic eosinophilia and/or 
decreased vacuolization); decreased pancreatic zymogen granules and decreased cytoplasmic 
granules in parotid salivary glands; lymphoid depletion in thymus, spleen and mandibular 
lymph node; and atrophy of the primary spongiosa of the metaphysis (femur and/or 
tibia/fibula).  The 13-week NOAEL in monkeys was considered 0.03 mg/kg/day.  Findings 
after recovery indicated reversal or abatement of tivozanib-related changes.   
Tivozanib did not produce genotoxic effects in any of the systems tested.

Confidential Property of AVEO Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 3.5 Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic (PK), toxicokinetic, and metabolic disposition studies were conducted with 
tivozanib in rats and monkeys, and PK data are available from a Phase 1 clinical trial in 
humans.  In rats and monkeys, peak serum concentrations of tivozanib were attained 
approximately 3–6 hr after oral administration, and the t ½ values averaged 7-12 hr.  
In the nude rat, the estimated average serum tivozanib concentration (C ssav) at steady state 
after oral doses of 0.2 mg/kg/day (the lowest dose with minimum efficacy in this animal 
model) was 70 ng/mL.   
In the rat and monkey, after both single and multiple oral doses of tivozanib, maximum (peak) 
plasma concentration (C max) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) were 
approximately dose proportional.   
3.6 Previous Human Experience 
3.6.1 Pharmacokinetics in Subjects with Solid Tumors 
Final PK data are available from Study KRN951/03-B01, completed in subjects with solid 
tumors.  PK data were collected from a total of [ADDRESS_955431] one dose of tivozanib.  Three doses of tivozanib were studied (1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 mg) in a 
regimen of [ADDRESS_955432] period.  Each 6-week regimen 
was considered one cycle.   
After single and multiple doses of tivozanib, the overall rate of absorption was slow.  Median 
time to peak serum concentration (t max) of tivozanib ranged from [ADDRESS_955433] variability was high, mean C max and AUC values after single and 
multiple doses were approximately dose proportional.  An evaluation of the available data 
predicted that tivozanib has a mean half-life across dose groups of approximately 4.7 days 
(112 hours) and ranging from 1.3 to 9.7 days (31 – 233 hours) (data not included in tables).  
Due to the unexpectedly long half-life of tivozanib in humans, sufficient timepoints to 
characterize the terminal phase were not available from all subjects.   
AUCs on Day [ADDRESS_955434] dose of Cycle 2, (ie, 14 days 
after administration of the previous dose on Day 28 of Cycle 1) still had detectable 
concentrations of tivozanib in serum indicating ongoing drug exposure during the 14-day 
dosing break at the end of Cycle 1.   
3.6.2 Clinical Activity 
TIVO-1 (AV-951-09-301) was an open-label, randomized, controlled, multi-national, 
multi-centre, parallel-arm trial comparing tivozanib (1.5 mg/day for 3 weeks on, 1 week off, 
continuously) to sorafenib (400 mg bid continuously) in patients with advanced RCC.  
Patients had undergone prior nephrectomy, and approximately 70% had received no prior 
systemic therapy in the metastatic setting.  The remaining patients had received one prior line 
Protocol: AV-951-15-[ADDRESS_955435] majority of which was cytokine treatment.  Prior 
therapy with an anti-angiogenesis agent was not allowed.  
The design of the study was such that patients with radiological evidence of progressive 
disease (PD) per investigator/local radiology assessment continued treatment until PD was 
verified by [CONTACT_296461].  Patients randomized to the sorafenib treatment arm 
who had verified PD (by [CONTACT_296461]) were discontinued from study drug 
treatment and given the option to receive tivozanib under a separate extension protocol 
(AV-951-09-902).  Patients who were discontinued from sorafenib treatment owing to the 
development of AEs or non-radiographic confirmed progression were not eligible to receive 
tivozanib.  Patients randomised to the tivozanib treatment arm who had radiological evidence 
of PD per investigator/local radiology assessment continued treatment until PD was verified 
by [CONTACT_296461], after which they were discontinued from study drug treatment 
but were not provided sorafenib per protocol.  Instead, these patients could only receive 
second line therapy consistent with the practices in the patient’s home country. 
Superiority was shown for the primary endpoint, progression-free survival (PFS), based upon 
blinded independent radiological assessment (per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid 
Tumors [RECIST] Version 1.0 definition).  The blinded independent radiological assessment 
showed the Median progression free survival (mPFS) in the tivozanib arm to be 11.9 months 
(95% confidence interval (CI) [9.3, 14.7]), compared with 9.1 months (95% CI [7.3, 9.5]) in 
the sorafenib arm.  This is a statistically significant improvement in mPFS, with a p-value of 
0.042, and a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.797 (95% CI [0.639, 0.993]).  
Additional key efficacy endpoints, including independent assessment of objective response 
rate (ORR) and duration of stable disease were statistically significantly improved for 
tivozanib, compared with sorafenib.  Forest plots assessing the efficacy of tivozanib vs. 
sorafenib in multiple subgroups showed consistent benefit of tivozanib over sorafenib.  
There was a slight difference in overall survival (OS), favoring the sorafenib randomized arm 
over the tivozanib randomized arm (29.3 months vs 28.8 months; p-value 0.105; HR 1.245 
[95% CI: 0.954, 1.624]). 
Evidence of Second Line Efficacy 
The updated analysis of the second line efficacy data (cut-off date of 24th April 2014) from 
study AV-951-09-902 has revealed that the mPFS for patients in the sorafenib arm who 
received tivozanib subsequent to sorafenib treatment is 11.0 months (95% CI [7.4, 12.9]).  
The overall median survival for this group was [ADDRESS_955436] crossover design of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_703556], but not 
vice versa.  This created an imbalance in second-line treatment between arms, particularly 
outside the EU and [LOCATION_002] (US) where second-line therapi[INVESTIGATOR_703557].  Owing to this imbalance, significantly more patients from the sorafenib arm who 
experienced disease progression were subsequently treated with next line targeted therapy (the

(tivozanib followed by [CONTACT_78150]-protocol next line targeted therapy).  At the time of the prior NDA 
submission (September 2012) 13% of patients randomized to tivozanib had received targeted 
next line treatment with TKI vs 63% of patients randomized to sorafenib who received second 
line tivozanib.  An updated analysis of the second line data indicates that as of December 
2014 even more patients in the sorafenib arm (approx. 70%) have received second line 
tivozanib following disease progression; whereas, only 36% of the patients randomized to the 
tivozanib arm who subsequently experienced disease progression have received targeted next 
line therapy. 
To further understand the effect of crossover on OS in Study AV-951-09-301 an analysis was 
performed on the 186 patients enrolled in the study in the EU and North America (NA) (NA; 
US and Canada). The participating countries were Bulgaria, Canada, Czech Republic, [LOCATION_009], 
Hungary, Italy, Poland, Romania, [LOCATION_006], and the US.  In these territories the standard of care is 
more likely to include second line therapi[INVESTIGATOR_703558]-way 
crossover.  This analysis revealed that for the NA and EU region while the significant benefit 
for PFS remains for the tivozanib arm, the non-significant trend in OS favors the tivozanib 
arm as well.  The OS for the tivozanib arm was 35.9 months versus 31.0 months for the 
sorafenib arm (p-value 0.576; HR 0.892 [95% CI: 0.599, 1.329]).   
Consequently, the OS data do not provide an accurate measure of relative survival against the 
comparator in this study.  Nevertheless, with this caveat in mind, OS values for the sorafenib 
arm and the tivozanib arm were amongst the longest seen in pi[INVESTIGATOR_703559].  
To conclude, the evidence provided above indicates that the imbalance in crossover between 
the two treatment arms in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_703560], and as such makes the OS results difficult to interpret.  
Consolidated Safety Data 
The AE profile for tivozanib in the TIVO-1 trial (Study AV-951-09-301) is consistent with 
the prior Phase 2 experience (AV-951-07-201).  Comparable rates of serious adverse events 
(SAEs) and AEs with fatal outcomes occurred in each arm. 
AEs that were more common in the tivozanib arm than in the sorafenib arm included 
hypertension (44.0% vs 34.2%) and dysphonia (20.5% vs 4.7%).  AEs that were more 
common in the sorafenib arm than in the tivozanib arm included hand-foot syndrome (54.1% 
vs 13.1%), skin rashes (17.2% vs 4.7%); and diarrhoea (31.5% vs 21.6%).  Other common 
AEs were similar in both arms, including fatigue, asthenia, and weight decrease (all ~15-
20%).  Fewer grade 3 or higher AEs occurred in the tivozanib arm than in the sorafenib arm 
(56.8% vs 68.5%).  More grade 3 or higher hypertension events were observed in the 
tivozanib arm (24.7% vs 17.1%) and more grade 3 or greater hand-foot syndrome events were 
observed in the sorafenib arm (16.7% vs 1.9%).  Ischemia cerebrovascular AEs occurred in 
2.7% of patients on the tivozanib arm and in 1.6% of patients on the sorafenib arm. 
Cardiovascular AEs were similar in each arm.  Grade 3 or higher liver enzyme perturbations 
were less frequent with tivozanib compared to sorafenib and proteinuria was similar between 
the two arms.

with those in the sorafenib group (99, [38.5%] patients).  Furthermore, fewer patients who 
received tivozanib had dose reductions overall (29, [11.2%] patients) compared to sorafenib 
patients (96, [37.4%] patients).  More subjects in the tivozanib group had dose interruptions 
for hypertension (5.4% vs 3.5%), and more subjects in the sorafenib group had dose 
interruptions for hand-foot syndrome, diarrhoea, and asthenia (16.7% vs 1.9% and 3.5% vs 
1.9% and 1.9% vs 0.8%).  More subjects in the sorafenib group had dose reductions for 
hand-foot syndrome, diarrhoea, hypertension, and lipase increased compared with the 
tivozanib group (17.9% vs 1.9%; 4.3% vs 1.5%; 4.3% vs 1.5%, and 2.3% vs 0.4% 
respectively).  Less than 2% of subjects had a dose reduction for asthenia or fatigue in either 
group.  These dose interruption and reduction data suggest an improved patient tolerability for 
tivozanib versus sorafenib. 
3.7 Study Rationale  
3.7.1 Rationale for the Tivozanib Dose 
In Study KRN951/03-B01, 3 of 8 subjects in the 2 mg tivozanib group experienced a dose 
limiting toxicity (DLT), indicating that the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) had been 
exceeded.  Based on the results of this study, the MTD was determined to be 1.5 mg/day, and 
the safety of this dose has been confirmed in multiple subsequent studies. 
3.7.2 Rationale for the Tivozanib Dosing Regimen 
The initial Phase 1 clinical study (KRN951/03-B01) adopted a dosing regimen with 28-day 
continuous administration of tivozanib followed by 14-day rest period (during which time no 
study drug is administered).  This study demonstrated that the MTD of tivozanib is 
1.5 mg/day, and that toxicities are rapi[INVESTIGATOR_703561].  The dosing 
regimen was altered for Study AV-951-07-201 to 21-day (3 weeks) continuous administration 
of tivozanib followed by 7-day (1 week) rest period during which no study drug is 
administered.  The rationale for changing the dosing regimen was to minimize the rest period 
during treatment but yet allow subjects to recover from any treatment-related toxicity during 
the 7-day break.  Clinical data with sunitinib have demonstrated that subjects experience 
recurrence of disease-related symptoms during a 14-day break in treatment [7].  Therefore, the 
break in tivozanib dosing was reduced from 14-days (Study KRN951/03-B01) to 7 days 
(Study AV-951-07-201) in an effort to maximize clinical benefit to subjects.  The 1.5 mg/day 
dose given continuously for 21-days followed by a 7-day break has been well tolerated in 
272 subjects enrolled in Study AV-951-07-201, and to date only 23 (8.5%) subjects have 
required a dose reduction and 8 (2.9%) have required a dose interruption.  Therefore, this 
dosing regimen will be used in this Phase [ADDRESS_955437] line VEGFR 
inhibitor and is used in advanced RCC. Subjects will be randomized (1:1) to treatment with 
tivozanib or sorafenib.  As differences in such factors as co-medications, prior treatments, and 
palliative care may affect enrollment rates across the participating centers, the randomization

Exclusion Criteria. 
7.1 Procedures/Parameters to be Measured 
See the Study Flowchart ( Table 1, beginning on page 12) for the timing of the procedures to 
be performed at each visit. 
All subjects will be assessed by [CONTACT_703605], laboratory, and other diagnostic 
assessments throughout the study.  Subjects will be treated on an outpatient basis, unless 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_702416]. 
Subjects must voluntarily sign and date the study-specific Institutional Review Board 
(IRB)/Ethics Committee (EC)-approved informed consent before any study-related 
procedures (with the exception of disease assessment for screening if it was completed as part 
of standard of care) are performed. 
All screening assessments are to be performed within [ADDRESS_955459] according to the schedule of assessments.  The visit window of 
± 2 working days does not apply to study drug administration.  Visit assessments will be 
performed prior to administration of the study drug for that day.   
If significant changes from baseline are noted during the course of the study, additional 
unscheduled clinic visits may be undertaken by [CONTACT_093], or requested by [CONTACT_456], 
in order to determine both the relevance of the finding(s) and the duration of the event(s). 
All end-of-treatment assessments are to be performed within [ADDRESS_955460] study 
drug dose unless delayed due to the occurrence of an adverse event.  Note:  subjects starting 
any new anti-cancer therapy must complete the End-of-Treatment Visit prior to starting the 
new anti-cancer therapy.   
A follow-up visit will be performed 30 days  (± 7 days)  following the last dose of study drug. 
After the 30-Day Follow-up visit, subjects will be contact[CONTACT_603509] [ADDRESS_955461] long-term survival data.
Protocol: AV-951-15-[ADDRESS_955462] has signed 
and dated an IRB/EC approved informed consent form (ICF).  The signing of the ICF can 
occur outside of the 21-day screening period; however, all protocol related procedures must 
only be performed after signing of the consent.  
Demographic/Medical History 
A complete medical history will be taken.  Information to be documented includes 
demographic information (age, gender, ethnicity, and race), prior and ongoing medical 
illnesses and conditions, and surgical procedures (not related to the primary diagnosis).   
Note:  Data will be collected according to local regulations. 
Disease History 
This information should include the date of initial diagnosis, date of most recent relapse, 
staging at study entry, prior anti-cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (including radiation therapy) and/or 
surgeries, current signs and symptoms of malignant disease, metastatic sites of disease, and 
measurement of target lesions.  For prior antineoplastic treatments, start and end dates of 
treatments, and method by [CONTACT_703606] (eg, CT, MRI). 
IMDC Risk Category 
The IMDC risk category will be determined according to the IMDC criteria (see Appendix H ). 
Prior and Concomitant Medications 
Prior medications will be collected at the time of screening.  All concomitant medications will 
be collected from time the subject signs the ICF throughout the subject’s participation in the 
study, including a period of [ADDRESS_955463] dose of study drug. 
Adverse Event Assessments 
Refer to Section 12 for information regarding adverse events reporting requirements.  
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status 
Subject’s performance status will be assessed using the ECOG performance status tool (see 
Appendix B ). 
Vital Sign Measurements 
Vital sign measurements will be collected after the subject has been sitting for 5 minutes.  
Vital sign assessments will include measurements of diastolic and systolic blood pressure 
(mmHg), heart rate (beats per minute), respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487] (breaths per minute), and body 
temperature (Celsius). 
Physical Examination 
A complete physical examination (PE) will be performed at screening by a physician or staff 
member who is qualified to perform such examinations (eg, physician’s assistant, or nurse 
Protocol: AV-951-15-303 28-Sep-2018 
Version 4.0 
Page 39 of 110 
Confidential Property of AVEO Pharmaceuticals, Inc. practitioner).  The complete PE will include a thorough review of all body systems and 
include measurements of weight (kg) and height (cm).   
At all other visits throughout the study, a directed PE, including weight (kg), will be 
completed in a targeted manner covering body systems related to the subject’s disease or 
relevant findings in the complete PE performed a the Screening visit.   
Hematology 
Hematology assessments are to include complete blood count (CBC) with differential and 
platelet count.  Hematology evaluations should be increased in frequency in the event of a 
clinically significant hematologic toxicity. 
Serum Chemistries 
Serum chemistry assessments are to include measurements of sodium, potassium, chloride, 
bicarbonate (optional), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, glucose, total bilirubin, direct 
bilirubin, AST, ALT, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alkaline phosphatase, calcium, 
magnesium, phosphorus, albumin, amylase, lipase, and total protein.  
Thyroid Function Tests 
Thyroid function tests are to include measurements of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), 
total T3 (triiodothyronine) (optional), and free T4 (thyroxine).  
Coagulation Parameters 
Coagulation parameter assessments are to include measurements of prothrombin time (PT) 
and/or international normalized ratio (INR), and partial thromboplastin time (PTT).   
Urinalysis  
Urinalysis assessments are to include determinations of protein, glucose, ketones, 
urobilinogen, occult blood, and microscopic sediment evaluation.  A 24-hour urine for protein 
will be performed whenever protein is 4+.
Pregnancy Test 
A serum pregnancy test will be performed on all females of childbearing potential within 
[ADDRESS_955464] dose of study drug.
12-Lead Electrocardiogram (ECG) 
ECGs will be performed after subjects have been supi[INVESTIGATOR_17044] 10 minutes.  
Assessment of normal, abnormal, not clinically significant, and abnormal, clinically 
significant (with reason noted) will be collected in the electronic case report form (eCRFs).
Disease/Response Assessment   
Disease and response assessments will be determined using RECIST (Version 1.1, 
Appendix A ).  
Disease/response assessment is to include disease classification (including details of the 
primary diagnosis and histological/cytological type and stage of disease at Screening) and 
diagnostic imaging / measurement of lesions.  
Protocol: AV-951-15-[ADDRESS_955465], abdomen, and pelvis at baseline.  
During subsequent disease/response assessments, a CT scan or MRI of the head will only be 
required if the subject had brain metastasis at baseline or new symptoms suggestive of brain 
metastasis.  The location of target and non-target lesions and dimensions of target lesions will 
be documented on the subject’s eCRF, where such information is available.   
Response assessment and updates will be performed and documented.  Response assessment 
will continue until the time of disease progression or start of another anti-cancer therapy. 
If disease progression is documented at any time, no further imaging or lesion measurements 
will be required.  Diagnostic studies documenting disease response must be available for 
review by [CONTACT_456], if requested. 
In the event of an objective response, the duration of the response will be determined from the 
day the initial response is observed (using screening/baseline images for comparison) to the 
day that progression is observed.  Duration of disease stabilization will also be assessed (see 
Appendix A).  In the case of stable disease (SD), follow-up measurements must have met the 
SD criteria at least once after study entry at a minimal interval of [ADDRESS_955466]-dose 
and at Cycle 1, Day 15- pre-dose (within 2 hours before dosing). 
Study Drug Administration Diary 
A Study Drug Administration Diary will be provided to the study subjects at the start of each 
cycle.  Diary information will be recorded and/or collected from each subject during study 
visits.

•All subjects will be followed until death from any cause (unless the subject is lost 
to follow-up, withdraws consent for the entire study, or the Sponsor terminates the 
study early).  After the 30-Day Follow-up visit, subjects will be contact[CONTACT_703607] [ADDRESS_955472] long-term survival data.  Additional contacts 
may be made to support key analyses, such as the analysis of overall survival at the 
time of the final PFS analysis, and the final analysis of overall survival.   
•Response assessment (CT scan or MRI scan):  for subjects with ongoing objective 
response or disease stabilization at the time of treatment discontinuation, who 
discontinue for reasons other than radiological evidence of progressive disease, 
tumor assessments will continue to be collected (every [ADDRESS_955473] 
year [beginning from the date of the last scan performed prior to treatment 
discontinuation], every 3 months during the second year, and every 6 months 
thereafter) until disease progression is confirmed by [CONTACT_703608]-cancer therapy (see  Section 7.2.4). 
7.2 Study Drug Administration 
7.2.1 Tivozanib Administration 
Tivozanib will be administered orally, at a dose of 1.5 mg/day, beginning on Day 1 of 
Cycle 1.  Subjects will receive tivozanib once daily for 3 weeks followed by 1 week off study 
drug (1 cycle = 3 weeks on, 1 week off).  One cycle will be defined as [ADDRESS_955474] 1 hour before or 2 hours after ingesting any 
food or other medications.  On days of a scheduled clinic visit, the dose of sorafenib should be 
taken at the clinic after visit procedures are completed.  Treatment with sorafenib will 
continue if tolerated and in the absence of documented disease progression.  If a dose is 
vomited or if a dose is missed during a cycle for any reason, the dose should not be made up.  
If Day 1 of a cycle is delayed for any reason, the complete 28 days of sorafenib should be 
administered once the cycle is started.

Confidential Property of AVEO Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 7.2.3 Review of Safety Data During Study 
The investigator(s) and medical monitor(s) will review safety data on an ongoing basis 
throughout the study and make decisions regarding the advisability of continuing accrual to 
the study.  In order to do so, the following will occur:   
•All serious adverse events (SAEs) must be reported to the sponsor within 24 hours 
of the investigator becoming aware of the SAE (see Section 12.3, Serious Adverse 
Events).   
•The Adverse Events pages of the subject’s eCRF should be promptly completed 
(ie, within 2 weeks) of a subject’s visit (or being discontinued from the study).  
7.2.4 Duration of Study Treatment  
Subjects with documented stable disease or an objective response may continue to receive 
therapy at the same dose and schedule until disease progression or unacceptable toxicities 
occur, or if other withdrawal criteria are met, as outlined in Section 11.1.
Discontinuation:  Subjects experiencing unacceptable toxicities will be discontinued from 
further study treatment.  Subjects with radiological evidence of progressive disease (per 
RECIST Version 1.1) per investigator/local radiology assessment should continue treatment 
until progressive disease is verified by [CONTACT_296461].  Images should be 
submitted for independent review as soon as possible (see Imaging Manual for specific 
instructions).  Verification of progressive disease is not required in the following 
circumstance: 
•Significant clinical deterioration that is compatible with progressive disease.  
Subjects who have documented disease progression (as verified by [CONTACT_703609]) will be discontinued from the study treatment. 
7.2.[ADDRESS_955475]’s last dose of 
study drug.  This period will be extended if any observed toxicity, thought to be associated 
with study drug, has not resolved or returned to baseline.  
Note:  The occurrence of any significant post-therapy event thought to be associated with study drug must be 
reported to the sponsor.  
Subjects starting any new anti-cancer therapy must complete the End-of-Treatment Visit prior 
to starting the new anti-cancer therapy.  Adverse Event Assessment will be conducted in order 
to confirm that all events have resolved, stabilized, or returned to baseline and that no 
longer-term deleterious effects of study drug administration have become evident.  
In the event that a subject has an ongoing objective response or disease stabilization at the 
time of treatment discontinuation, who discontinues for reasons other than radiological 
evidence of progressive disease (per RECIST Version 1.1, as confirmed by [CONTACT_501721]), tumor assessments will continue to be collected (every [ADDRESS_955476] year [beginning from the date of the last scan performed prior to treatment 
discontinuation], every 3 months during the second year, and every 6 months thereafter) until 
disease progression (per RECIST Version 1.1) is confirmed by [CONTACT_703610]: AV-951-15-[ADDRESS_955477] from overall study 
participation (ie, death, subject withdrawal of consent, or loss to follow-up, or study closure).   
After discontinuation from all study treatment, follow-up information for long-term survival 
and subsequent anti-cancer therapy, if available, will be obtained every 3 months from the 
End of Treatment Visit or 30-Day Follow-up Visit (whichever is later) until death, withdrawal 
of consent, loss to follow-up, or study closure, whichever occurs first.  Additional contacts 
may be made to support key analyses, such as the analysis of overall survival at the time of 
the final PFS analysis, and the final analysis of overall survival.  
7.[ADDRESS_955478] be recorded on the 
eCRF, including the date, indication, description of the procedure(s) and any clinical finding. 
Any medication considered necessary for the subject’s welfare, and which is not expected to 
interfere with the evaluation of the study drug, may be given at the discretion of the 
investigator.  Drugs and treatment specifically excluded are described in Section 6.3, Drugs 
and Other Treatments to be Excluded. 
7.4 Randomization and Blinding 
The IWRS will be used for randomization and drug management (packaging of clinical 
supplies, shippi[INVESTIGATOR_703562], and dispensing to subjects). 
Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio (tivozanib: sorafenib) stratified by [CONTACT_703611] (favorable; intermediate; poor) and prior therapy (two prior VEGFR TKIs; a prior 
checkpoint inhibitor [PD-1 or PD1 L inhibitor] plus a prior VEGFR TKI; a prior VEGFR TKI 
plus any other systemic agent). Once the strata have been identified, treatment will be 
randomly assigned to a subject within the strata using a complete permuted block design, in 
an unblinded fashion (open-label).  In the event a subject had both [ADDRESS_955479] begin treatment with study drug within 14 days after randomization.

Periodically throughout and at the conclusion of the study, an inventory of unused bottles of 
study drug will be conducted by a representative of the sponsor.   
9 ASSESSMENT OF ACTIVITY 
9.1 Disease Classification and Response Assessments  
Data on disease classification and the duration of disease stabilization or any objective 
response, as well as the time to disease progression, will be collected for all subjects.  Subjects 
will undergo disease assessment at screening (within [ADDRESS_955483] dose of study drug) 
and every [ADDRESS_955484] (Version 1.1) criteria (Appendix A ).   
Disease parameters to be assessed: 
•Disease classification 
•Diagnostic imaging/measurement of target lesions 
•Response assessment.  
Disease Classification 
Details of the primary diagnosis should be documented at the Screening Visit.  The 
histological/cytological type and stage of disease should be noted on the eCRF. 
Diagnostic Imaging/Measurement of Lesions 
Subjects should be followed with the same imaging procedure throughout this study; if 
progressive disease (PD) is documented at any time per RECIST Version 1.1, no further 
imaging or lesion measurements will be required after PD is verified by [CONTACT_703609]; diagnostic studies documenting response must be available for sponsor review. 
Response Assessment  
Response will be assessed as detailed in Appendix A  using RECIST criteria Version 1.1.  All 
subjects who receive a minimum of 2 cycles of study drug will be considered evaluable for 
response assessment.  All subjects who develop early progressive disease (regardless of the 
Protocol: AV-951-15-303 28-Sep-2018 
Version 4.0 
Page 50 of 110 
Confidential Property of AVEO Pharmaceuticals, Inc. duration of the study treatment) prior to response evaluation will be considered to have 
progressed on study. 
The duration of any objective response is to be measured from the date the initial response is 
observed to the date that disease progression is observed.  In the case of SD, follow-up 
assessments must have met the SD criteria at least once after study entry, at a minimal interval 
of [ADDRESS_955485] has an ongoing objective response or disease stabilization at the 
time of treatment discontinuation, who discontinue for reasons other than radiological 
evidence of progressive disease, tumor assessments will continue to be collected (every 
[ADDRESS_955486] year, every 3 months during the second year, and every 6 months 
thereafter) until disease progression is confirmed by [CONTACT_703612]-cancer therapy.  Data will continue to be collected on the duration of objective 
response or disease stabilization, as well as on the overall time to disease progression until the 
subject experiences disease progression as confirmed by [CONTACT_171311], or 
starts another anti-cancer therapy. 
[ADDRESS_955487] will be performed 
throughout the course of this study.  Anticipated toxicities that may be experienced are 
detailed in Section 3.1, Background; Section 13, Precautions; and in the Investigator’s 
Brochure (IB).  Grades of toxicity (NCI Common Terminology for Adverse Events [CTCAE 
Version 4.03]), as well as clinical judgment, will be used to determine appropriate 
management of the subject experiencing any adverse event while participating in this study.

Version 4.0 
Page 54 of 110 
Confidential Property of AVEO Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Note:  Adverse events resulting in a subject’s permanent discontinuation from the study treatment, 
regardless of seriousness or relationship to study drug, MUST be promptly reported to the 
sponsor/designee.  Subjects removed from treatment for intolerable toxicity should still be followed 
with regular tumor assessments (see Section 7.2.4) until disease progression or start of new 
treatment, and for survival thereafter.   
3. Documented progressive disease according to RECIST Version 1.1 at any time during 
the study.   
4. Subjects with radiological evidence of progressive disease per investigator/local 
radiology assessment should continue treatment until progressive disease is verified by

soon as possible (see Imaging Manual for specific instructions).  Verification of 
progressive disease is not required in the following circumstance: 
•Significant clinical deterioration that is indicative of progressive disease. 
5. Subjects who have documented disease progression will be discontinued from study 
drug treatment and will continue to be followed up for survival.   
6. Clinical progression (eg, symptomatic deterioration) not meeting the RECIST 
Version 1.[ADDRESS_955501] be captured in AE eCRF 
page, the term “progressive disease” should not be recorded as an adverse event or 
captured on the eCRF page.  
7. Treatment interruption for > 4 weeks (ie, total duration of interruption, including the 
1 week/cycle break in dosing of tivozanib), unless there is clear benefit from 
treatment, in which case the investigator must contact [CONTACT_703618]’s condition in order to resume treatment. 
8. Requirement for a significant surgical procedure.   
Note:  Subjects requiring a minor surgical procedure (eg, port placement, skin abscess drainage) 
may continue on study at the investigator’s discretion following discussion with the medical 
monitor .  A brief interruption in therapy (< 4 weeks) may be considered. 
9. An intercurrent illness which, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], would prevent 
completion of study-related evaluations. 
10. Significant deviation from the protocol or eligibility criteria.  Such subjects will be 
considered protocol violations and will be removed from study unless there is an 
exemption granted that is agreed upon between the investigator and the sponsor.  
11. Pregnancy. 
12. Noncompliance with study or follow-up procedures. 
13. Subject withdrawal of consent and election to discontinue the study treatment. 
Note: The subject is free to withdraw from the study drug and/or study for any reason and at any 
time without giving reason for doing so and without penalty or prejudice.  In the event of consent 
withdrawal, the site should make every effort to ensure that the subject is followed for AEs for a

RECIST Version 1.1 (as confirmed by [CONTACT_171311]), initiation of new 
anti-cancer treatment, or discontinuation of the subject from overall study participation (death,

dose of study drug (data on SAEs will be collected until resolution of the event unless 
otherwise noted).   
All SAEs must be reported to the Sponsor, as delineated in Section 12.[ADDRESS_955505] medical occurrence in the form of signs, symptoms, 
abnormal laboratory findings, or diseases that emerges or worsens relative to baseline, during 
a clinical study with a study drug, regardless of causal relationship and even if no study drug 
has been administered. 
AEs may include the following types of occurrences: 
•Suspected adverse drug reactions; 
•Other medical experiences, regardless of their relationship with the study drug, 
such as injury, surgery, accidents, extensions of symptoms or apparently unrelated 
illnesses, and significant abnormalities in clinical laboratory values or vital signs, 
psychological testing or physical examination findings; 
•Reactions from study drug overdose, abuse, withdrawal, sensitivity, toxicity or 
failure of the study drug’s expected pharmacological action. 
In cases of surgical or diagnostic procedures, the condition/illness leading to such a procedure 
is considered as the AE rather than the procedure itself.   
In case of a fatality, the cause of death is considered as the AE and the death as its outcome.

Version 4.0 
Page 56 of 110 
Confidential Property of AVEO Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 12.1.1 Abnormal Laboratory Findings and Other Objective Measurements 
Abnormal laboratory findings or other objective measurements that meet the criteria for a 
SAE (see Section 12.3) result in discontinuation of the study drug, require medical 
intervention or are judged by [CONTACT_703619].  
12.1.2 Medical History 
Medical conditions present at the initial study visit are defined as medical history, and are 
NOT to be considered AEs.  These medical conditions should be adequately documented on 
the medical history page of the eCRF.  However, medical history conditions, other than the 
disease under study, that worsen in severity or frequency during the study and are considered 
clinically significant by [CONTACT_703620].  
12.1.3 Exacerbation of Primary Malignancy 
In this protocol, symptoms and signs of exacerbation or worsening of primary malignancy 
will usually be captured in the context of efficacy assessment, and recorded on the pages of 
the appropriate eCRF.  Therefore, symptoms, or signs of exacerbation or worsening of the 
primary malignancy will not be considered as AEs nor captured on the AE page of the eCRF 
unless the event is considered possibly or probably related to the study drug (ie, the worsening 
is not consistent with the anticipated natural progression of the disease), or the subject is 
discontinued from study drug due to clinical progression without documented progressive 
disease.  In this case the events suggesting clinical progression should be recorded in the 
eCRF. 
12.[ADDRESS_955506] and/or through questioning of the subject.  To elicit 
AEs, questioning at each study visit should begin with simple non-leading questions.  For 
example: 
•How have you felt since your last visit? 
•Have you had any health problems since you were here last? 
If a subject is seen by a physician not involved with the study in relation to an AE, the 
Investigator should make every effort to contact [CONTACT_684118] a timely manner in 
order to obtain all information necessary to appropriate reporting of the event.  
The Investigator is required to grade the severity/intensity of each AE according to the 
National Cancer Institute - CTCAE, Version 4.03.  A general grading (severity/intensity) scale 
is provided at the beginning of the NCI-CTCAE document, and specific event grades are also 
provided.  If a particular AE’s severity/intensity is not specifically graded by [CONTACT_703621], the Investigator is to revert to the general definitions of Grade [ADDRESS_955507] medical judgment.  
Note:  Death is mainly regarded as an outcome and should be documented as described below. 
12.3 Serious Adverse Events (SAE)  
(Notify sponsor or designee within 24 hours; document on eCRF) 
Protocol: AV-951-15-303 28-Sep-2018 
Version 4.0 
Page 57 of 110 
Confidential Property of AVEO Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Any SAE requires expedited reporting to the Sponsor’s Pharmacovigilance department, 
regardless of its relationship to the study drug. 
An SAE is defined as an AE that at any dose: 
•Results in death – ie, the AE causes or contributed to the death of the subject. 
•Is life threatening – ie, the AE places the subject at immediate risk of death; the 
definition does not apply to an AE that hypothetically might cause death if it were 
more severe. 
•Requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] - ie, the AE requires at least a 
24-hour inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9613] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_279340]. 
oHospi[INVESTIGATOR_304692], for social 
reasons or for normal disease management (including treatment 
adjustment) is not to be considered as an SAE according to this criterion. 
oElective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_703568] (eg, 
an overnight stay to facilitate chemotherapy and related hydration therapy 
application) are not considered as SAEs.  However, all events leading to 
unplanned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_703569] (eg, undesirable effects of any administered treatment) must 
be documented and reported as SAEs. 
•Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect -  ie, an adverse outcome in a child or 
fetus of a subject exposed to the study drug before conception or during 
pregnancy.   
•Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity - ie, the AE resulted 
in a substantial disruption of the subject’s ability to conduct normal activities. 
•Is a medically important condition 
Such an event may not be immediately life threatening or result in death or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but is clearly of major clinical significance.  The AE may 
jeopardize the subject or require intervention to prevent a serious outcome. 
For the purposes of reporting, any suspected transmission of an infectious agent via a study 
drug is also considered a serious adverse reaction and all such cases should be reported in an 
expedited manner as described above. 
12.[ADDRESS_955508] is participating in the study.  For example, a protocol-related 
AE may be an event that occurs that is related to a procedure required by [CONTACT_760]. 
Protocol: AV-951-15-[ADDRESS_955509] dose of study drug.  
It is important that each reported AE (including SAEs) be accurately recorded on the AE page 
of the subject’s eCRF.  An AE report includes a description of the event, whether it is 
considered serious (and if so the criterion satisfied), its duration (onset and resolution dates), 
its severity (graded using a 5-point scale), its relationship to the study drug as assessed by [CONTACT_3786], any other potential causality factors (if known), any method of treatment given 
or other action taken (including dose modification or discontinuation of the study drug) and its 
outcome.  
New AEs and changes in ongoing AEs or those with an unknown outcome must be recorded 
until [ADDRESS_955510] dose of study drug.  
However, any SAE or medically relevant AE that has an ongoing or unknown outcome (as 
determined by [CONTACT_703622]’s Pharmacovigilance department), will be 
followed until resolution or stabilization under the responsibility of the Sponsor’s 
Pharmacovigilance department.  Beyond the 30-Day Follow-up Visit period, data regarding 
any new, unsolicited, SAE spontaneously reported to the Sponsor by [CONTACT_703623]’s Pharmacovigilance department within the Safety 
Database, rather than within the Clinical Database.  SAEs occurring after the 30-Day 
Follow-up Visit, which are assessed as related to study drug, should be reported to the 
Sponsor.   
If a subject is documented as lost to follow-up, no further attempt will be made to follow up 
on ongoing AEs or AEs of unknown outcome.  
For screening failure subjects, new SAEs and changes in SAEs will be monitored from the 
signing of the informed consent until the date the subject was determined to be a screening 
failure.  Beyond that date, SAEs which occurred between the signing of informed consent and 
determination of screen failure will be followed-up by [CONTACT_1034]’s Pharmacovigilance 
department.  
12.[ADDRESS_955511] notify the Sponsor (or their designee) within 24 hours of becoming 
aware of a new SAE or of new (follow-up) information on a previously reported SAE.  
To do so, the Investigator/Reporter must complete an SAE Report Form as detailed in the 
SAE Report Completion Instructions.  The SAE Report Form will be transmitted by [CONTACT_3786]/Reporter to the Sponsor’s Pharmacovigilance department/designee for this study.  
12.6.[ADDRESS_955512] becoming aware of the death.  Deaths occurring 
after the 30-day period do not need to be reported as SAEs for this study (however, deaths

Confidential Property of AVEO Pharmaceuticals, Inc. occurring at any time after the 30-day follow-up period and which are assessed as related to 
study drug should be reported to the Sponsor as SAEs).  If the report is given via telephone 
rather than in writing on the form designated for SAE reporting, a full description of the 
circumstances, including the Investigator-determined causality in relation to the study drug 
must be provided, so that the appropriate written report can be completed by [CONTACT_703624].   
Reports of all deaths must also be communicated as soon as possible to the appropriate IRB or 
EC and/or reported in accordance with local law and regulations. 
12.6.3 Reporting of Overdose 
An overdose of tivozanib or sorafenib is higher than the intended dispensed dose.  
Information on overdoses in clinical subjects is collected by [CONTACT_1034]'s Drug Safety 
Surveillance department.  Should a subject experience an overdose during the course of the 
study (whether symptomatic or not), the investigator or qualified designee must report to the 
Sponsor within [ADDRESS_955513] overdose (whether 
accidental or intentional) or a product abuse and/or withdrawal is considered an AE and 
should be reported as such (see Sections 12.1-12.5 ).  If a serious adverse event occurs in 
conjunction with the overdose, then the reporting time frame for an SAE ([ADDRESS_955514] becoming aware of the event) must be met.  The Sponsor will provide instructions on 
how to collect this information.  
12.6.[ADDRESS_955515]/Ethics Committee 
The Investigator must comply with any applicable requirements related to the reporting of 
SAEs involving his/her subjects to the IRB/EC that approved the study.  In particular, all 
deaths must be promptly reported to the IRB/EC that approved the study.  
In accordance with International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Good Clinical Practice 
(GCP) guidelines, the Sponsor will inform the Investigator of “findings that could affect 
adversely the safety of subjects impact the conduct of the study or alter the IRB/EC’s 
approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_43932].”  In line with respective regulations and 
Sponsor’s policy, the Sponsor will inform the Investigator of adverse events that are both 
serious and unexpected and are considered to be possibly or probably related to the study drug 
by [CONTACT_737]/Reporter.  The Investigator will keep copi[INVESTIGATOR_703570].  National regulations with regards to Safety Report notifications to 
Investigators will be also taken into account.  
Unless clearly defined otherwise by [CONTACT_108103]-specific regulations, and duly documented, 
the responsible Investigator will promptly notify the concerned IRB/EC of any Safety Reports 
provided by [CONTACT_703625][INVESTIGATOR_703571].  The 
Sponsor will provide appropriate Safety Reports directly to the concerned IRB/EC and 
maintain records of these notifications only when specifically required by [CONTACT_19124].  
Protocol: AV-951-15-[ADDRESS_955516] include the following information at a 
minimum: 
•Clear identification of the Investigator/Reporter with full contact [CONTACT_3031]. 
•Subject identification details (study number, site number, initials, date of birth). 
•Study drug administration details (dose and dates). 
•Diagnosis of the event with the description (or a brief description of 
signs/symptoms/clinical course if the diagnosis is not available) and the date of 
onset and duration. 
•Reason(s) for considering the event serious. 
•Relationship of the event with the study drug or with the study procedure (eg, the 
causality according to the Investigator). 
•Height, weight, or body surface area (where required for dose calculation). 
•Underlying diagnosis and extent of disease. 
•Lot number and expi[INVESTIGATOR_703572] (if available). 
•Dose, route, frequency, and duration of study drug administered. 
•Date of death (if applicable). 
•Intervention(s) required. 
•Concomitant therapy (including regimen[s] and indication). 
•Pertinent laboratory data/diagnostic study (including dates). 
•Pertinent medical history. 
•Study drug status (dose interrupted, discontinued). 
•Did event abate after interruption of study drug administration (if applicable)? 
•Did event recur after study drug was reintroduced (if applicable)? 
In addition, the Investigator/Reporter must respond to any request for follow-up information 
or questions the Sponsor may have regarding the SAE within the same timelines as for the 
initial reports.  
12.[ADDRESS_955517] be promptly reported by [CONTACT_95873]/EC.  Should the FDA or 
other regulatory authorities require that the Sponsor submit additional data on the event, the 
Investigator will be asked to provide those data to the Sponsor in a timely fashion.

Version 4.0 
Page 61 of 110 
Confidential Property of AVEO Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Note:  All subjects are to be followed for [ADDRESS_955518].  Follow-up data concerning the SAE (eg, diagnostic test reports, 
physician's summaries, etc.) also must be submitted to the Sponsor, as they become 
available, preferably by [CONTACT_702510] e-mail transmission, until resolution of the SAE.  
12.[ADDRESS_955519] be reported to the Sponsor’s 
Pharmacovigilance department.   
The Investigator must notify the Sponsor in an expedited manner (as per the same procedures 
and timelines described for expedited AE reporting in Section 12.5) by [CONTACT_703626] I of 
the Pregnancy Reporting and Outcome Form.   
Note:  Pregnancy itself is not an AE.  Only pregnancies considered related to study drug by [CONTACT_3786] (ie, resulting from a drug interaction with a contraceptive medication) are 
considered as AEs and should be recorded on the AE eCRF.   
Investigators must actively follow-up, document and report to the Sponsor’s 
Pharmacovigilance department the outcome of all these pregnancies, even if the subject was 
withdrawn from the study.  Pregnancy outcomes are not recorded in the eCRF unless 
considered adverse events (eg, spontaneous abortion, congenital anomaly, etc.).   
Pregnancy outcomes must be reported to Sponsor’s Pharmacovigilance department by 
[CONTACT_703627].  Timelines vary according to the nature of the pregnancy outcome: 
•For normal outcomes, the Sponsor should be notified within 45 days from 
birth/delivery.  
•For abnormal outcomes, the fully completed form must be sent to Sponsor’s 
Pharmacovigilance department according to the same procedures and timelines 
described for expedited AE reporting in Section 12.5.    
Additional guidance can be found in the completion conventions provided by [CONTACT_1034]. 
[ADDRESS_955520] use effective 
contraception during the study and follow-up period.  Sexually active pre-menopausal female 
subjects (and female partners of male subjects) must use adequate contraceptive measures, 
while on study and for at least [ADDRESS_955521] dose of study drug.  Effective birth control includes (a) IUD plus one barrier 
method, or (b) two barrier methods.  Effective barrier methods are male or female condoms, 
diaphragms, and spermicides (creams or gels that contain a chemical to kill sperm).  Oral, 
implantable, or injectable contraceptives may be affected by [CONTACT_9058] P450 interactions, 
and are not considered effective for female subjects in this study.

14 DATA EVALUATION AND STATISTICS 
14.1 General Design 
This is a Phase 3, randomized, controlled, open-label, parallel-arm, multi-national, 
multi-center study to compare tivozanib to sorafenib in subjects with refractory advanced 
RCC.  The primary endpoint is progression-free survival and the primary analysis is to 
compare the PFS of subjects treated with tivozanib to those treated with sorafenib. 
Protocol: AV-951-15-303 28-Sep-2018 
Version 4.0 
Page 63 of 110 
Confidential Property of AVEO Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 14.2 Sample Size Justification 
A sample size of 322 subjects (161 subjects per treatment arm) with total number of 
255 events will provide 90% power to detect statistically significant differences between 
treatment arms with respect to progression-free survival as assessed by [CONTACT_703628].  Analysis of the primary endpoint will occur after [ADDRESS_955523] occurred.  
A simulatio n indicates that the an alysis could be perfo rmed ≥ [ADDRESS_955524] is 
a
ccrued.  The sample size was determined based on the following assumptions: 
•The distribution of the PFS for the two treatment arms will be compared by [CONTACT_2329] a 
Log-rank  test with two-sided 5% significan ce level (α). 
•Th
e median PFS for subjects receiving sorafenib and tivozanib is 4 months and 
6 months, respectively (an increase of 2 months or 50%). 
•An equal number of subjects will be assigned to each treatment arm. 
•Enrollment will take 15 months. 
•The drop out percentage per treatment arm will be 3%. 
The first secondary analysis will compare OS between the [ADDRESS_955525], the stratification factors included in the primary analysis, and two-sided 0.8% 
significance level (utilizing a Lan-DeMets alpha spending function with an O’Brien-Fleming 
boundary).  The interim OS analysis will be done at the time of the final PFS analysis.  
Assuming a median OS for sorafenib of 12 months and a median OS for tivozanib of 
16 months, 245 OS events at the time of final OS analysis and 149 OS events at the time of 
final PFS analysis will yield approximately 61% power to demonstrate longer OS for 
tivozanib using the log-rank test, given 2.5% type I error (one-sided).  The final OS analysis 
will be performed when all subjects have been lost to follow-up, have withdrawn consent, or 
have died, or when all subjects in follow-up have been on-study for at least [ADDRESS_955526]® statistical package Version 6.[ADDRESS_955527] data 
listings.  Demographic, baseline characteristics, efficacy, and safety data will be summarized 
by [CONTACT_703629] (if applicable). 
Descriptive statistics will be provided for every variable.  The statistics will include sample 
size (n), mean, median, standard deviation (STD), minimum, and maximum for continuous 
variables.  Categorical variables will be summarized using number and percentages.  
14.3.1 Study Populations 
Three populations will be used in the analyses of the data: 
1. The intent-to-treat (ITT) population will consist of all randomized subjects; this 
population will be used for efficacy analysis, including primary endpoint 
(progression-free survival).  Subjects will be analyzed as randomized. 
Protocol: AV-951-15-303 28-Sep-2018 
Version 4.0 
Page 64 of 110 
Confidential Property of AVEO Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 2. The per protocol (PP) population is defined as all randomized subjects who received at 
least two cycles (8 weeks) of protocol treatment (unless discontinued due to death or 
disease progression), have no major protocol deviations that will confound the effects 
of treatment, and meet all eligibility criteria.  Major protocol deviations include but are 
not limited to failure to satisfy eligibility criteria and taking prohibited medications 
during the treatment phase of the study.  Subjects will be analyzed as treated. 
3. The safety population (SAF) will include all subjects who received at least one dose of 
either study drug.  Subjects will be analyzed as treated. 
14.3.[ADDRESS_955528] Accountability, Demographics, and Baseline Characteristics 
All subjects enrolled (signed informed consent) in the study will be included in the summary 
of subject accountability by [CONTACT_703630].  The frequency and percentages of 
subjects who were enrolled in the study, discontinue from treatment before having 
documented disease progression, or discontinue from the study due to documented disease 
progression will be summarized for the ITT population.  
Descriptive statistics of subject demographics (age, gender, ethnicity, and race) and baseline 
characteristics will be summarized and presented by [CONTACT_2939].  
14.3.[ADDRESS_955529] will be classified as having a protocol deviation if one incurs an event belonging to 
any one of the following categories:  1) violation of the inclusion/exclusion criteria; 2) taking 
prohibited medications or treatments; 3) treatment misallocation; 4) violation of 
discontinuation criteria; 5) error in procedures and tests; and 6) missed visits.  Other deviation 
categories may be identified as appropriate. 
14.3.4 Efficacy 
The primary efficacy endpoint (PFS) and secondary efficacy endpoints (OS, ORR, and DoR) 
analyses will be carried out using the ITT population.  The primary efficacy endpoint of PFS 
also will be analyzed using the PP population. 
Analysis of the Primary Endpoint 
The primary analysis is to compare the PFS of subjects dosed with tivozanib with those 
subjects dosed with sorafenib.  The null hypothesis is that the median tivozanib PFS is equal 
to that of sorafenib and the alternative hypothesis is that the two PFS medians are not equal.  
The IRR will be the primary data source for the PFS analysis. 
The primary analysis will be carried out by [CONTACT_2329] a stratified Log-Rank test, in which the 
stratification factors are IMDC risk category (favorable; intermediate; poor) and prior therapy 
(two prior VEGFR TKIs; a prior checkpoint inhibitor [PD-1 or PD1 L inhibitor] plus a prior 
VEGFR TKI; a prior VEGFR TKI plus any other systemic agent), and using a two-sided 
5% significance level.  The distribution of the PFS will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier 
method.  The median event time and 2-sided 95% confidence interval for the median will be 
also provided.   
Protocol: AV-951-15-[ADDRESS_955530] been observed.  The interim 
analysis will look into the study’s futility using PFS as the efficacy evaluation endpoint.  This 
will utilize a Lan-DeMets error spending-type function with an O’Brien-Fleming stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_703574]-sided beta (Type II error) of 1.2 % spent during this interim 
look.   
The interim analysis will be performed by [CONTACT_55467].  The independent 
statistician will evaluate and interpret the results of the interim analysis and will provide 
corresponding recommendation whether to stop the study for futility or for the study to 
continue until end of study condition has been met. 
Final analysis performed on PFS will be based on 255 events.  This could be performed 
≥ [ADDRESS_955531] with IMDC risk category and prior therapy as stratification 
factors. 
Handling of Missing Data 
For the purpose of PFS analyses, the following steps will be considered in case of missing 
data: 
a) Subjects with missing imaging at baseline will be considered non-evaluable for 
PFS estimation and will be excluded from the PFS analyses 
b) Subjects who have no tumor assessment after randomization will have PFS 
censored at the date of randomization, unless they died before the second 
scheduled tumor assessment. 
Further details and other cases will be described in the statistical analysis plan (SAP).   
Analysis of Secondary Endpoints 
The secondary endpoints (OS, ORR, and DoR) will be analyzed using the investigator and 
independent radiological review assessments.  The degree of agreement between the 
investigator and the independent assessment of responses will also be summarized and 
presented in a table.   
The first secondary analysis will compare the OS between the [ADDRESS_955532] and the stratification factors included in the primary analysis.  An 
interim OS analysis will be carried out at the time of the Final PFS analysis. 
Duration of response (DoR) will be analyzed using the same method as for the 
progression-free survival.   
The proportion of subjects achieving confirmed ORR (complete response [CR]+partial 
response [PR]) will be summarized and presented by [CONTACT_703631]-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test with 
the same stratification factors used for the PFS analysis. 
Protocol: AV-951-15-[ADDRESS_955533] if 
cumulative percentages (survival curves) are equal (median time to each cycle from 
randomization) by [CONTACT_5268]. 
Subgroup Analyses 
PFS su bgroup analyses by g ender, race, and age (< 65 years and  ≥ 65 years) will be carried 
out
 using separate unadjusted Log-rank test for the ITT population. 
Definition of Efficacy Endpoints 
Progression-Free Survival (PFS)  is defined as the time from randomization to first 
documentation of objective tumor progression (progressive disease [PD], radiological) 
according to RECIST (Version 1.1) or death due to any reasons whichever comes first. PFS 
data will be censored on the day following the date of last tumor assessment documenting 
absence of PD for subjects who do not have objective tumor progression and are still on study 
at the time of the analysis, are given anti-tumor treatment other than the study treatment, or 
are moved from treatment follow-up prior to documentation of objective tumor progression.  
Subjects having no tumor assessments after randomization who are not known to have died 
will have PFS censored on the date of randomization. 
Overall survival (OS)  is defined as the time from the date of randomization to date of death 
due to any cause.  In the absence of confirmation of death, survival time will be censored at 
the last date the subject is known to be alive.  Subjects lacking data beyond randomization 
will have their survival times censored on the date of randomization. 
Overall response rate (ORR)  is defined as the proportion of subjects with confirmed CR or 
confirmed PR according to RECIST (Version 1.1), relative to the total population of 
randomized subjects.  Confirmed responses are those that persist on repeat imaging study at 
least 4 weeks after the initial documentation of response. 
Duration of response (DoR)  is defined as the time from the first documentation of objective 
tumor response to the first documentation of objective tumor progression or to death due to 
any cause.  DoR data will be censored on the day following the date of the last tumor 
assessment documenting absence of PD for subjects who do not have tumor progression and 
are still on the study at the time of an analysis, are given antitumor treatment other than the 
study treatment, are removed from the study follow-up prior to documentation of objective 
tumor progression, died of non-cancer related cause, including death due to unknown cause in 
the absence of documented disease progression .  DoR will only be calculated for the 
subgroup of subjects with an objective tumor response (PR or CR) . 
14.3.5 Safety Data 
The safety parameters (study drug exposure, adverse events, laboratory parameters, vital 
signs, medical history, concomitant medications, and physical examinations) will be analyzed 
using the SAF population.

Confidential Property of AVEO Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Adverse Events 
Adverse events will be coded by [CONTACT_9313] (SOC) and preferred term using the 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA ™) Dictionary (Version 18.0 or later).  
Summary tables will be presented for treatment emergent adverse events by [CONTACT_2939].  
An overall presentation of treatment emergent adverse event information will show the 
number and percent of subjects with at least one event by [CONTACT_2939].  
Adverse event information will be also presented by [CONTACT_703632].  If a subject had more than one occurrences of an adverse 
event, the most severe grade or most highly treatment-related category will be used in the 
summary tables.  
All adverse events will be listed.  The following listings will be also provided:  1) subjects 
who died during the study; 2) subjects with treatment emergent SAEs; 3) subjects who 
discontinued due to treatment emergent AEs; and 4) other significant treatment emergent 
adverse events. 
Laboratory Analyses 
Laboratory assessments (hematology, serum chemistry, urinalysis, and coagulation 
parameters) will be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_31703].  The change from 
baseline will be summarized for all post-baseline evaluations. 
The shift (based on normal ranges) from baseline will be summarized by [CONTACT_703633].  The significant of shifts in laboratory parameters may be evaluated within each 
treatment arm using generalized McNemar’s test. 
The signed-rank test may be used to evaluate the within-group mean change from baseline.  
The mean change from baseline between the treatment arms will be compared using a 
Rank-Sum test. 
The first laboratory observation will be taken when the lab tests are repeated.  However, if the 
first observation is missing, then the repeat value within the same visit will be used.

For each concomitant medication taken during the study, the generic component will be 
identified using the World Health Organization Drug Dictionary (WHO-DD; WHODDB3 
ENHANCED JUN 2015).  Frequencies and percentages of the subjects taking each 
concomitant medication will be tabulated by [CONTACT_703636].  
A subject will only be counted once within each generic component term. 
14.3.6 Safety Monitoring Committee 
A safety monitoring committee (SMC) will monitor the safety data from this study on a 
periodic basis in order to identify any issues and risks, as well as provide recommendations 
regarding the study design and conduct.  The SMC is composed of six members, all of whom 
are qualified clinicians in general oncology and renal cell carcinoma and have practical 
experience conducting and monitoring the safety and efficacy of clinical trials. 
The first review of the cumulative safety data will occur after [ADDRESS_955534] ACCESS TO SOURCE DATA/DOCUMENTS 
15.[ADDRESS_955535] to study ethics, protocol adherence, and 
data integrity and validity. 
This study will be closely monitored by [CONTACT_43770] (and/or designee) 
throughout its duration.  Monitoring will be in the form of personal visits with the investigator 
and their staff as well as any appropriate communications by [CONTACT_756], telefax, mail, or 
e-mail transmission.  The purpose of these contacts is to review study progress, investigator, 
and subject adherence to protocol requirements and any emergent problems associated with 
the conduct of the study.  The following points will be usually assessed during monitoring 
visits at the site:

18.5 Handling and Disposal of Investigational Materials 
Study drug should be stored in a secure location, under the indicated conditions (see 
Appendix F ; Tivozanib Study Drug Information and Appendix E, Sorafenib Prescribing 
Information).  After study drug is prepared for delivery and administered, the health care 
professional will maintain an inventory of all used bottles of study drug, after which all such 
supplies may be destroyed in an appropriate manner according to institutional policy.  
Destruction of such supplies will be documented.  Information regarding the number of 
bottles utilized for each subject, as well as the dose of study drug administered to the subject, 
will be recorded on the appropriate drug inventory form. 
Periodically throughout and at the conclusion of the study, unused bottles of study drug will 
be inventoried by a representative of the sponsor (or designee).  At the completion of this 
study, all unused study materials will be destroyed by [CONTACT_703647] (or 
designee).  Destruction of study drug by [CONTACT_703648] (or designee) 
has collected the site’s SOP for drug destruction.  
18.6 Recording and Processing of Data 
Clinical study data for this study will be captured in an electronic format.  Electronic data 
capture (EDC) services will be provided by [CONTACT_112623] (CRO).  The

(RECIST) VERSION 1.1 
Response criteria were adapted from:  Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 
Criteria; Version 1.1, 2009 (http://www.eortc.be/Recist/documents/RECISTGuidelines.pdf). 
1.[ADDRESS_955552] one dimension 
(longest diameter in the plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of: 
•10mm by [CONTACT_3610] (CT scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm). 
•10mm caliper measurement by [CONTACT_461] (lesions which cannot be accurately 
measured with calipers should be recorded as non-measurable). 
•20mm by [CONTACT_13190] X-ray. 
Non-measurable lesions are defined as all other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter 
<10mm o r pathological lymph  nodes with ≥10 to <15mm sh ort axis) as well as tru ly 
non-measurable lesions.  Lesions considered truly non-measurable include:  leptomeningeal 
disease, ascites, pleural or pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic 
involvement of skin or lung, abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by [CONTACT_143985]. 
Special considerations regarding lesion measurability: 
Bone lesions: 
Bone scan, PET scan or plain films are not considered adequate imaging techniques to measure 
bone lesions.  However, these techniques can be used to confirm the presence or disappearance 
of bone lesions.  Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic-blastic lesions, with identifiable soft tissue 
components, that can be evaluated by [CONTACT_703652].  Blastic bone lesions are non-measurable.  
Cystic lesions: 
Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be considered 
as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non-measurable) since they are, by [CONTACT_108], 
simple cysts.  ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as 
measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above.  However, if 
Protocol: AV-951-15-[ADDRESS_955553], these are preferred for selection as target 
lesions.   
Lesions with prior local treatment: 
Tumour lesions situated in a previously irradiated area, or in an area subjected to other 
loco-regional therapy, are usually not considered measurable unless there has been demonstrated 
progression in the lesion.   
1.[ADDRESS_955554] be documented within 4 weeks prior to start of therapy.  
1.2.1 Target Lesions 
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of five lesions total (and a maximum of two lesions per 
organ) representative of all involved organs should be identified as target lesions and will be 
recorded and measured at baseline (this means in instances where patients have only one or two 
organ sites involved a maximum of two and four lesions respectively will be recorded).  Target 
lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be 
representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to 
reproducible repeated measurements.  It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does 
not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which 
can be measured reproducibly should be selected.  A sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal 
lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the 
baseline sum diameters.  If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then as noted above, only 
the short axis is added into the sum.  The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to 
further characterise any objective tumour regression in the measurable dimension of the disease.  
1.2.2 Non-Target Lesions 
All other lesions (or sites of disease) including pathological lymph nodes should be identified as 
non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements are not required and 
these lesions should be followed as ‘present’, ‘absent’, or in rare cases ‘unequivocal 
progression’.  In addition, it is possible to record multiple non-target lesions involving the same 
organ as a single item on the case record form (eg ‘multiple enlarged pelvic lymph nodes’ or 
‘multiple liver metastases’).  
1.3 Tumor Response Criteria
1.3.1 Evaluation of Target Lesions 
Protocol: AV-951-15-303 28-Sep-2018 
Version 4.0 
Page 81 of 110 
Confidential Property of AVEO Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological lymph nodes 
(whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to 
<10 mm.  
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the
baseline sum if that is the smallest on study).  In addition to the
relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute 
increase of at least 5 mm.  (Note:  the appearance of one or more 
new lesions is also considered progression). 
Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum
diameters while on study.  
1.3.2 Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions 
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalisation of tumour 
marker level.  All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size 
(<10mm short axis).  
Non-CR/Non-PD: Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or maintenance 
of tumour marker level above the normal limits.  
Progressive Disease (PD):  Unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.  (Note: 
the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered
progression). 
1.[ADDRESS_955555] response recorded from the start of the study treatment until
the end of treatment taking into account any requirement for confirmation.  The patient’s best
overall response assignment will depend on the findings of both target and non-target disease and
will also take into consideration the appearance of new lesions.  In non-randomized trials where
response is the primary endpoint, confirmation of PR or CR is needed to deem either one the ‘best 
overall response’.  
Protocol: AV-951-15-303 28-Sep-2018 
Version 4.0 
Page 82 of 110 
Confidential Property of AVEO Pharmaceuticals, Inc. CR = complete response, PR = partial response, SD = stable disease,  
PD = progressive disease, and NE = inevaluable 
Note:   Subjects with a global deterioration of health status, requiring discontinuation of treatment without 
objective evidence of disease progression at that time, should be reported as “symptomatic 
deterioration.  ” Every effort should be made to document the objective progression, even after 
discontinuation of treatment. 
Conditions that may define “early progression, early death, and inevaluability” are study-specific and 
should be clearly defined in each protocol (depending on treatment duration, treatment periodicity). 
In some circumstances it may be difficult to distinguish residual disease from normal tissue. When the 
evaluation of complete response depends upon this determination, it is recommended that the residual 
lesion be investigated (fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]/biopsy), before confirming the complete response status. 
1.5 Guidelines for Evaluation of Measurable Disease 
All measurements should be recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers.  All baseline 
evaluations should be performed as close as possible to the treatment start and never more than 
4 weeks before the beginning of treatment.  
Note:  Tumor lesions in a previously irradiated area are not optimally considered measurable 
disease.  If the investigator thinks it appropriate to include them, the conditions under which such 
lesions should be considered must be defined in the protocol.  
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterise each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up.  Imaging based evaluation should 
always be done rather than clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being followed cannot be 
imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461].  DETERMINATION OF TUMOR RESPONSE

Confidential Property of AVEO Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial and P10mm 
diameter as assessed using calipers (eg skin nodules).  For the case of skin lesions, 
documentation by [CONTACT_12151] a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion is 
suggested.  
For Chest lesions , Chest CT is preferred over chest X-ray, particularly when progression is an 
important endpoint, since CT is more sensitive than X-ray, particularly in identifying new 
lesions.  However, lesions on chest X-ray may be considered measurable if they are clearly 
defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776].  
Cross Sectional Imaging :  CT is the best currently available and reproducible method to 
measure lesions selected for response assessment.  This guideline has defined measurability of 
lesions on CT scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5mm or less.  When CT 
scans have slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should 
be twice the slice thickness.  MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (eg for body scans). 
Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used as a method of 
measurement.  If new lesions are identified by [CONTACT_12153], confirmation 
by [CONTACT_12154].  If there is concern about radiation exposure at CT, MRI may be used 
instead of CT in selected instances.

Confidential Property of AVEO Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 2.3  Doses to be Administered 
    Tivozanib:  1.5 mg/day  
    Sorafenib:  400 mg twice daily 
2.4  Dosing 
Tivozanib:   The prescribed oral daily dose of tivozanib is to be taken, preferably in the 
morning, with water.  Tivozanib should be taken at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after 
ingesting any food or other medications.  Grapefruit juice should not be ingested during 
the study.  On days of a scheduled clinic visit, the dose of tivozanib should be taken at the 
clinic after visit procedures are completed.  Treatment with tivozanib will continue if 
tolerated and in the absence of documented disease progression.  If a dose is vomited or if 
a dose is missed for any reason, the dose should not be made up.  If Day 1 of a cycle is 
delayed for any reason, the complete 21 days of tivozanib should be administered once 
the cycle is started.  Only one tivozanib capsule should be taken each day.
Sorafenib:   The prescribed twice-daily oral dose of sorafenib should be taken without 
food at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after ingesting any food or other medications.  On 
days of a scheduled clinic visit, the dose of sorafenib should be taken at the clinic after 
visit procedures are completed.  Treatment with sorafenib will continue if tolerated and in 
the absence of documented disease progression.  If a dose is vomited or if a dose is 
missed for any reason, the dose should not be made up.  If Day 1 of a cycle is delayed for 
any reason other than an adverse event, the complete 28 days of sorafenib should be 
administered.   
3   DISPENSING, DISPOSAL AND INVENTORY OF STUDY DRUG 
1. The investigator (or designee, ie, study pharmacist) at the site will be responsible for 
handling study drug and maintaining required documentation.  The investigator (or 
designee) will:   
•Prepare the appropriate dose to be dispensed, as determined by [CONTACT_423]’s dose 
assignment. 
•Record pertinent information regarding the doses of study drug prepared (eg, subject 
identification code, date of dispensing, number of doses/bottles dispensed, etc.) on 
the Drug Dispensing Log, or other appropriate study drug inventory.  This inventory 
will be maintained throughout the duration of the trial and will be periodically 
reviewed by a representative of the sponsor. 
•Instruct the subject that all dispensed pi[INVESTIGATOR_703580]-up 
visit, at which time a tablet/capsule count will be conducted to assure subject dosing 
compliance.

trial, all partially used and empty pi[INVESTIGATOR_703581] (or designee) so that a final subject-dosing inventory may be 
conducted. 
2. Throughout the conduct of this trial, the investigator (or designee) will maintain a careful 
inventory of all partially used and empty bottles of study drug.  Empty bottles may then 
be destroyed in an appropriate manner according to institutional policy.  Destruction of 
such bottles will be documented, and disposition records will later be reviewed by a 
representative of the sponsor.  All partially used bottles may be returned to the sponsor or 
designee (details to be provided), unless otherwise authorized in writing.   
Note: No other use of tivozanib study drug intended for use in this trial is authorized by 
[CONTACT_456].  The investigator (or designee) will be responsible for the 
appropriate handling and disposition of residual study drug in partially used 
bottles.  Once returned to the investigator, capsules from partially used bottles 
will not be re-dispensed to another subject . 
3.  Periodically throughout and at the conclusion of the study, an inventory of unused bottles 
of study drug will be conducted by a representative of the sponsor.  At the completion of 
this trial, all unused study materials will be destroyed by [CONTACT_703653] (or designee).  Destruction of study drug by [CONTACT_703654] (or designee) has collected the site’s SOP for drug destruction. 
4  BOTTLE LABELS 
Study drug bottle labels will bear the appropriate label text for investigational agents, as required 
by [CONTACT_9071].
5  RESUPPLY REQUESTS 
An IWRS will be used for management (shippi[INVESTIGATOR_703582], and 
dispensing to subjects).  Information regarding resupply via the IWRS will be in the 
IWRS study manual, provided separately.

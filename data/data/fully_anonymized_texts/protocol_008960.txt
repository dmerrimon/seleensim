11-GYN-098-MCC 51.0 OBJECTIVES 
 
 This is a prospective study to evaluate the hypothesis that:    
 
 a) platinum-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by [CONTACT_204636]-based adjuvant chemotherapy is associated with 
improved maximal surgical cytoredu ction rates, comparable survival, 
decreased morbidity, and increased quality of life in patients with International Federation of Gynecologic Oncology (FIGO, Appendix I) 
stages IIIC and IV ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_204604] 
20,45, and  
 
b) cancer induced inflammation is a predictor of poor prognosis and response to therapy in this group of ovarian cancer patients. 
  1.1 Primary Objectives 
    1.11 To determine maximal surgical cytoreduction debulking rate (see 
Appendix V), i.e. no gross residual disease, in a group of patients with 
FIGO stages  IIIC and IV ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_204605] 3 cycles of platinum-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy. 
  1.2 Secondary Objectives 
  
  1.21 To determine progression-free survival in a group of patients with 
FIGO stages IIIC and IV ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_204606]. 
  
  1.22 To determine overall survival in a group of patients with 
FIGO stages IIIC and IV ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_204606]. 
   1.23 To determine response rate to chemotherapy in patients who  
   undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by [CONTACT_204637]. 
   1.24 To evaluate the toxicity from  chemotherapy, as measured by [CONTACT_204638] v4.0.  
     1.25 To evaluate operative outcomes including length of surgery,  
  length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], ICU admissions, transfusions, and     intraoperative  complications (blood loss >1500mL, unintentional    damage to organs requiring repair). 
 
  1.26  To evaluate Quality of Life (QOL, as measured by [CONTACT_92349]-O  
   TOI) following treatment with this regimen. (Appendix II)  
 
11-GYN-098-MCC 61.[ADDRESS_244193] been reported to be as high as 70% in 
selected institutions, most centers will achieve optimal surgical debulking 
in only 30-60% of patients with Stage IIIC/IV ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_76351]
9,10.   
 
 2.2 New Strategies to Improve Outcomes 
 Five-year overall survival for ovarian cancer is around 50% for all patients.  Unfortunately, over 2/[ADDRESS_244194] stage III or stage IV disease at the time of diagnosis.  The 5-year survival for these patients is 30%, as opposed to 90% for patients with disease confined to the ovary.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_204607], trends 
in survival have changed little over the past [ADDRESS_244195] of care for patients with ovarian cancer since the 1930’s.  The landmark study by [CONTACT_204639] 1975 showed an inverse relationship between the extent of residual disease 
after primary surgery and survival
11.  The concept of surgical debulking to 
improve survival is based on several principles including:  1) elimination 
of pharmacologic sanctuaries by [CONTACT_204640], 2) increased sensitivity to chemotherapy secondary to higher growth fraction of small residual tumors, and 3) less resistance to chemotherapy as a result of fewer chemotherapy cycles.  Bristow published a meta-
analysis in [ADDRESS_244196] 
significant determinant of patient survival in those patients with stage III or IV ovarian cancer treated with platinum-based chemotherapy
8.  The 
definition of “optimal” with respect to surgical debulking for ovarian cancer 
 
11-GYN-098-MCC 7has evolved over time.  Initially, ≤ 2 cm residual disease was considered 
optimal, which was subsequently reduced to ≤  [ADDRESS_244197] indicated acceptable complication rates and feasibility of performing these procedures for the purpose of cytoreductive surgery in ovarian cancer
12-19.  However, maximal and 
optimal surgical cytoreductive rates vary widely among institutions, ranging from less than 25% to 75% in more experienced centers
8.   
Patients with extensive liver disease, pulmonary metastases, or extensive disease throughout the small bowel mesentery generally cannot be maximally debulked to no gross residual disease status prior to initiating 
adjuvant chemotherapy. 
 Neoadjuvant chemotherapy, followed by [CONTACT_204641], has been proposed as an alternative to initial surgical cytoreduction in patients with advanced ovarian cancer.       
 2.[ADDRESS_244198] benefit is seen in patients with no gross residual disease after initial cytoreductive surgery.  It is also clear that there is no benefit of initial cytoreductive surgery in patients with ovarian cancer when more than 1 cm residual disease remains after attempted debulking. 
 
 2.4 Role of Neoadjuvant Platinum-based Chemotherapy and Interval   
  Debulking in Ovarian, Primary Peritoneal, and Fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_204608]. conducted a randomized phase III trial comparing upfront 
debulking surgery with neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with Stage 
IIIC or IV epi[INVESTIGATOR_91810] (EORTC [ZIP_CODE])20.  Patients were 
randomized to either primary debulking surgery followed by [CONTACT_2669] 6 
courses of platinum-based chemother apy (Arm A) or 3 courses of 
platinum-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy, interval debulking surgery (in patients with a response or stable disease) and at least 3 more courses of platinum-based chemotherapy (Arm B).  Seven-hundred eighteen 
patients were enrolled and 670 were randomized.  Less than half of the 
patients (41.6%) undergoing primary surgery had ≤1cm residual disease 
at the completion of cytoreductive surgery, as opposed to 80.6% of patients who had ≤1cm residual disease after interval debulking.  Only 
 
11-GYN-098-MCC 819.4% of the patients undergoing primary surgery had no residual tumor 
(maximal surgical debulking) after cytoreductive surgery, compared to 51.2% of patients in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy group.  Overall 
survival and progression-free survival were similar in the two groups.  In 
the primary surgery group, the medi an overall survival was [ADDRESS_244199] independent predictor of survival (P<0.001), followed by [CONTACT_204642] (P=0.001), small tumor size before randomization (P=0.001), 
endometrioid histologic type (P=0.005), and younger age (P=0.005).  They concluded that “neoadjuvant chemotherapy is not inferior to primary cytoreductive surgery for patients with stage IIIC or IV ovarian carcinoma,” and that there were “no significant advantages” observed in 
either arm of the trial “with respect to survival, adverse effects, quality of 
life, or postoperative morbidity or mortality”.    Kumar et al. presented findings from a similar randomized trial at the 2007 Annual ASCO meeting
21.  The trial included 128 patients with 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_76296], who were randomized to either upfront debulking surgery followed by 6 cycles of paclitaxel and carboplatin (Arm A) or neoadjuvant chemotherapy with 3 cycles of paclitaxel and carboplatin followed by [CONTACT_204643] 3 more cycles of the same chemotherapy (Arm B).  Patients in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy arm had a higher optimal debulking rate (p < 0.0001), 
decreased blood loss during surgery (mean loss 520 ml vs. 373 ml, p < 
0.003), and reduced postoperative infections (14.8% vs. 2.5%, <0.04).  Mean operative time and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_204609].  The median overall survival and disease fr ee survival were 42 vs. 29 months 
(p=0.07) and 20 vs. 25 months (p = 0.11) for arms A and B, respectively, 
which is not significantly different at a median follow up of 41 months.  
Quality of life scores were significantly better in the neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy arm (93 vs. 114, p < 0.001).  They concluded, “neoadjuvant chemotherapy in advanc ed epi[INVESTIGATOR_204610] a higher optimal debulking rate with reduced postoperative morbidity and improved quality of life”.  
In 2009, Onda et al. published “Feasibility study of neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy followed by [CONTACT_204644]/IV ovarian, tubal, and peritoneal cancers:  Japan Clinical Oncology Group Study JCOG0206” in Gynecologic Oncology
22.  The study included 56 
patients with clinically diagnosed staged III/IV müllerian carcinomas based on imaging studies, cytology, and tumor markers.  All patients underwent diagnostic laparoscopy to confirm the clinical diagnosis.  The patient subsequently underwent 4 cycles of paclitaxel and carboplatin followed by [CONTACT_204645] 4 more cycles of the same chemotherapy.  The primary endpoint was complete clinical remission 
and the secondary endpoint was the positive predictive value of clinical 
diagnosis.  The authors found that the positive predictive value of clinical diagnosis was 95% for tumor origin, histology, and stage of disease.  Complete clinical response was seen in 42% of patients, which was 
 
11-GYN-098-MCC 9confirmed with diagnostic laparoscopy at the end of treatment.  The 
median overall survival was 45 m onths and the median progression-free 
survival was 14 months. 
  2.5   Rationale for Clinical Trial Design 
 
2.51 Study Population 
  A study population limited to patients with probable Stage IIIC or 
 Stage IV ovarian, fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_8916], or primary peritoneal carcinomas 
 was selected because of the relatively high frequency of these  cases and the limited probability that optimal cytoreduction (no  visible disease) could be achieved by [CONTACT_204646].   Furthermore, the results of this trial would be better generalized to 
 the population at large with epi[INVESTIGATOR_204611].  Patients with early stage epi[INVESTIGATOR_204612] > 95 percent of these cases can be  optimally debulked by [CONTACT_204647], and selective 
 chemotherapy can be given postoperatively. 
 2.52 Sample Size Considerations 
 
Using previous results from a European study of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, 51.2% of patients in the neoadjuvant arm achieved 
maximal surgical debulking as compared to 19.4% of patients in 
the primary debulking control arm.
[ADDRESS_244200] of a single proportion with 90% power and a two-sided type I error rate equal to 0.05, the first-stage sample size necessary for this single arm study to detect the same 
improvement in the percentage of neoadjuvant chemotherapy 
patients achieving optimal surgical debulking as compared to the European controls is 9 patients. The trial will be terminated if no more than 2 patients achieve maximal surgical debulking, as defined by [CONTACT_204648].  If the 9
th patient is enrolled 
and only two prior patients meet requirements for maximal 
surgical debulking, then enrollment will be on hold until after 
surgery for the 9th patient.  If maximal surgical debulking is 
achieved in 3 or more of the 9 patients enrolled, the trial will continue to a second stage, which will involve enrollment of an additional 14 patients for a total of 23. Conservatively allowing 
20% drop out or loss to follow up, we plan to enroll 28 total 
patients. 
 
  2.53 Diagnostic Criteria   
 
In the aforementioned publication (see 2.4) by [CONTACT_204649]. 
concerning the feasibility of neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed 
by [CONTACT_204650]/IV ovarian, tubal, and peritoneal cancers, the authors reported that the positive predictive value of a combination of imaging studies, cytology, and tumor markers 
 
11-GYN-098-MCC 10was 100% for tumor origin and histology, and 95% for stage of 
disease.[ADDRESS_244201] in the 
future.  Based on this data, the diagnostic criteria needed for entry 
into this trial include evidence of metastatic disease on imaging studies (CT, CT/PET, MRI), cytologic examination of ascites and/or pleural fluid, or fine-needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_136959] a tumor mass. 
-   2.54 Choice of Cytotoxic Chemotherapy and Optimum Number Cycles 
 Since the mid 1980’s, platinum-based chemotherapy has been the standard of care in the treatment of ovarian cancer.  In GOG 47, [ADDRESS_244202] primary therapy for patients with advanced epi[INVESTIGATOR_204613]. However, it is estimated that on the order of 5% of patients in the population eligible for participation in the current trial will develop peripheral neuropathy 
or refractory acute hypersensitivi ty infusion reactions which would 
necessitate discontinuation of paclitaxel. Docetaxel is a novel taxane with reduced potential for neurotoxicity compared with paclitaxel. In addition, docetaxel has been safely substituted for 
 
11-GYN-098-MCC 11paclitaxel in patients experiencing severe acute hypersensitivity to 
paclitaxel refractory where re-challenge is either unsuccessful or 
deemed unsafe .  
 
With regard to efficacy, there is  evidence that docetaxel is an 
alternative treatment option to paclitaxel for patients with epi[INVESTIGATOR_204614]. Docetaxel has b een 
combined with cisplatin or carboplatin extensively in phase II and III clinical trials.  Docetaxel has substantial activity against platinum-refractory ovarian carcinoma
32 and is also active as primary therapy 
in ovarian cancer.33,34,34,36 A phase III randomized trial (SCOTROC) of 
docetaxel and carboplatin versus paclitaxel and carboplatin in patients with advanced epi[INVESTIGATOR_204615].
37 In this trial, patients received carboplatin at an 
AUC of 5 with either docetaxel at 75 mg/m2 1-hour IV infusion or 
paclitaxel at 175 mg/m2 3-hour IV infusion. Results of this trial 
demonstrated no significant difference in median progression-free survival (15.0 months versus 14.8 months), two year overall survival (64.2% versus 68.9%) or objective tumor response (58.7% versus 59.5%) for the combination of docetaxel and carboplatin versus the combination of paclitaxel and carboplatin,
 
respectively. While docetaxel and carboplatin produced more neutropenia (Grade 3-4 neutropenia 94% for docetaxel and carboplatin versus 84% for paclitaxel and carboplatin, p < .001) and neutropenic complications than treatment with paclitaxel-carboplatin, the docetaxel and carboplatin regimen was significantly less neurotoxic (Grade 2 neurosensory toxicity in 
11% for docetaxel and carboplatin versus 30% for paclitaxel and 
carboplatin, p 
< .001).   
 
The results of the SCOTROC trial have led many oncologists to select substitution of docetaxel for paclitaxel in first line therapy for 
patients with advanced epi[INVESTIGATOR_204613]. Thus, in order to optimize cytotoxic therapy in all arms of the current trial, reduce the likelihood of protocol violations and avoid imbalances in the type of taxane utilized in each treatment arm, in the current trial docetaxel will be selectively substituted for paclitaxel in circumstances in which peripheral neuropathy or hypersensitivity 
warrants discontinuation of paclitaxel.
  
 
  2.[ADDRESS_244203]-Remission Therapy 
 
It is expected that all of the chemotherapy regimens employed in 
this trial will achieve an overall response rate of greater than 75%. 
However, as many as 90% of patients with stage III and stage IV  
epi[INVESTIGATOR_12253], peritoneal primary and fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_204616]. Therefore, a number of strategies are under active 
consideration to delay or prevent recurrence. Among these 
strategies include “consolidation” treatment with cytotoxic, 
 
11-GYN-098-MCC 12hormonal, or biologic targeted agents.    For example, recent data 
have revealed that continuation of single-agent paclitaxel on a 
monthly schedule for 12 cycles significantly extended 
progression-free survival.38 Certainly consolidation therapy has 
been implemented variably in clinical practice outside clinical trials 
with the decision based on physician and patient preference, with no evidence that overall survival is influenced by [CONTACT_204651], at the time of clinical disease progression.  Due to the lack of evidence 
that any current consolidation approach is associated with an 
improvement in overall survival, and our desire to preserve the integrity of the progression-free interval, consolidation therapi[INVESTIGATOR_204617]. 
          
  2.57 CA-125 as a Biological Marker of Progressive Disease 
 
Serum levels of CA-125, a tumor-associated glycoprotein antigen, are elevated in 80% of patients with epi[INVESTIGATOR_76296].
39 CA-125 has been monitored, often on a freq uent basis, 
to verify response to therapy, presence of residual disease, and as early evidence of recurrence. However, CA-125 is not entirely tumor specific, and can be elevated in a variety of benign conditions, such as endometriosis, uterine fibroids, and pelvic inflammation; this is particularly true in pre-menopausal women. In addition, levels of CA-[ADDRESS_244204]-
therapy as evidence of recurrent or progressive disease, and will 
make therapeutic decisions based solely on the CA-125. This has complicated the assessment of PFS in prior randomized trials, as patients will receive new therapy prior to clinical documentation of progressive disease on the basis of physical examination or radiographic findi ngs. The current trial will employ 
a conservative formula to define progressive disease based on serial elevation of CA-125 
40 (in addition to other standard 
definitions in the management of solid tumors), but only following completion of initial chemotherapy. Although imperfect, it is preferable to apply uniform criteria that include CA-125 rather 
than absorb uncharacterized events that would compromise the 
secondary endpoint of PFS.  Progression during the period of cytotoxic chemotherapy will require radiographic or physical confirmation.
  
  2.6 Quality of Life (QoL) 
      
Most women with stage III and stage IV epi[INVESTIGATOR_12253], primary  
  peritoneal, and fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_204618], QoL is an important consideration in determining optimal  
 
11-GYN-098-MCC 13  treatment regimen.  The primary objective of measuring QoL in this  
  trial is to determine if the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, followed    by [CONTACT_204652] (improves  
  QoL).   In the current trial, QoL will be assessed using the Trial   
  Outcome Index of the Functional  Assessment of Cancer Therapy- 
  Ovary (FACT-O TOI).
41,[ADDRESS_244205]-G QOL dimensions of Physical Well-Being (7 items), Functional   Well-Being (7 items), and the Ovarian Cancer Subscale (12 item).  By    [CONTACT_204653], one is assured of capturing the full  
  range of physical aspects of QOL in advanced ovarian cancer,   
  including pain, fatigue, abdominal symptoms and functional status.  By   [CONTACT_204654]4, O1, and O3, which assess abdominal pain,   swelling, and cramps respectively, a comprehensive patient reported    assessment of disease related abdominal symptoms including ascites  
  can be evaluated.
  
 
  The timing of the QoL assessments is critical to capture data useful  
  for this regimen.  This is complicat ed by [CONTACT_204655] a decrease in QoL.  In order to avoid  
  the confounding affects of acute chemotherapy related toxicity,   
  questionnaires will be completed just before ([ADDRESS_244206]    dose) the next cycle of chemotherapy and focus on QoL within the last   seven days.  Thus assessments will be made:
  
  
    1. Prior to cycle 1 (t=0 weeks) 
    2. Prior to surgery (after 3 doses of chemotherapy, t=9  
     w e e k s )      3. Prior to cycle 4 (after [ADDRESS_244207] 1 after surgery, t=10 weeks)     4. 3 weeks after completion of chemotherapy (t=19 weeks) 
    5. 3 months after completion of chemotherapy (t=28  
     w e e k s )  
 2.7 Biologic Correlates 
 
Human and experimental epi[INVESTIGATOR_204619] a vigorous innate 
immune response at both primary and metastatic sites. On cellular level 
this innate immune response is mediated by [CONTACT_204656] (TAMs) and to a lesser extent platelets, mast cells, granulocytes, NK-cells, and fibroblasts. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_204620], this innate response intensifies with cancer 
progression.  Macrophages and other immune cells secrete cytokines which induce and maintain this process. At tumor sites these cytokines such as interleukin (IL-) 1,6,8, and 10, tumor necrosis factor (TNF-), α and 
β, TNF receptor II and tumor growth factor (TGF), and vascular 
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) play  important roles in suppression of 
the adaptive immune response, induction of a pathologic tumor 
vasculature and interstitial fluid space, tumor neo-vascularization, progression, metastasis, and resistance to chemo-  and radio-therapy. Once in the systemic circulation these cytokines contribute to 
 
11-GYN-098-MCC 14development of cachexia, weight loss, protein wasting, decreased 
performance status and an increase in chemotherapy toxicity. It is now clear that reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species 
(RNS) generated by [CONTACT_204657]. By [CONTACT_204658], we will be able to determine how measures of tumor protein damage relate to response.  In patients, the intensity of the innate response to cancers may predict for 
survival and poor response to therapy. Serum levels of certain cytokines 
such as TNF, IL-[ADDRESS_244208] negatively for overall survival in some cancers (e.g. lung, colorectal), although this has not been explored in ovarian cancer.   
We hypothesize that in patients with  ovarian cancer, systemic biologic 
markers of the innate immune response (i.e cytokines and surrogates for 
levels of oxidative stress) will correlate with overall survival and allow for the identification of patient subsets that may benefit from anti-inflammatory interventions. Specific ally we will capture TNF-a, TNF 
receptor II, protein oxidation, CRP, Il-6 and Il-8 at three time points and tumor tissue oxidation in operative s pecimens.  This study will provide an 
exploratory evaluation of this hypothesis and determine the feasibility of assessing the hypothesis in a randomized clinical trial.  
 2.8 Inclusion of Women and Minorities 
  This trial will not exclude potential subj ects from participating in this or 
 any study solely on the basis of ethnic origin or socioeconomic status.   Every attempt will be made to enter all eligible patients into this protocol  and therefore address the study objectives in a patient population 
 representative of the entire epi[INVESTIGATOR_12253], fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_8916], and 
 peritoneal primary cancer population treated by [CONTACT_69146].

11-GYN-098-MCC 174.0 STUDY MODALITIES 
4.1 Paclitaxel (NSC #673089) 
4.11 Formulation: Paclitaxel is supplied as a 6mg/mL non-aqueous 
solution in multi dose vials containing 30mg/5mL, 
100mg/16.7mL, or 300mg/50mL of paclitaxel. In addition to 6mg 
of paclitaxel, each mL of sterile non-pyrogenic solution contains 527mg of purified Cremophor® EL (polyoxyethylated castor oil) and 49.7% (v/v) dehydrat ed alcohol, USP. 
4.12 Storage: Unopened vials of paclitaxel are stable to the date 
indicated on the package when stored between 20 to 25°C (68 to 77°F). Protect from light. 
4.13 Preparation: Paclitaxel must be diluted prior to infusion. 
Paclitaxel should be diluted in 0.9% Sodium Chloride for Injection, USP; 5% Dextrose Injection, USP; 5% Dextrose and 
0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP; or 5% Dextrose in 
Ringer’s Injection to a final concentration of 0.3 to 1.2mg/mL. The solutions are physically and chemically stable for up to 27 hours at ambient temperature (approximately 25°C / 77°F) and room lighting conditions. 
NOTE: In order to minimize patient exposure to the plasticizer 
DEHP, which may be leached from PVC infusion bags or sets, diluted paclitaxel solutions should be stored in bottles (glass, polypropylene) or plastic (polypropylene, polyolefin) bags and administered through polyethylene-lined administration sets. 
Paclitaxel should be administered through an inline filter with a 
microporous membrane not greater t han 0.22 microns. Use of 
filter devices such as IVEX2® or IVEX-HP®, which incorporate short inlet and outlet PVC-coated tubing, has not resulted in significant leaching of DEHP. 
All patients should be premedicated with corticosteroids, 
diphenhydramine, and H
2 antagonists prior to paclitaxel 
administration in order to prevent severe hypersensitivity reactions. 
     4.14 Adverse Effects: Consult the package insert for the most current  
  and complete information.

 4.2 Carboplatin (Paraplatin® - NSC #241240) 
 
   4.21  Formulation: Carboplatin is supplied as a sterile, pyrogen-free,  
   10mg/mL aqueous solution in multi-dose vials containing  
   50mg/5mL, 150mg/15mL, 450mg/45mL, or 600mg/60mL of  
   carboplatin. 
    4.22  Storage: Unopened vials of carboplatin are stable to the date  
   indicated on the package when stored at 25°C (77°F).      Excursions from 15 to 30°C (59 to 86°F) are permitted. Protect  
   from light. Carboplatin multi dose vials maintain microbial,  
   chemical, and physical stability for up to 14 days at 25°C     following multiple needle entries.  
       4.23 Preparation: Carboplatin aqueous solution can be further  
   diluted to concentrations as low as 0.5mg/mL with 5%      Dextrose in Water or 0.9% Sodium Chloride for Injection, USP.     When prepared as directed, carboplatin aqueous solutions are     stable for 8 hours at room temperature (25°C / 77°F). Since no     antibacterial preservative is c ontained in the formulation, it is  
   recommended that carboplatin solutions be discarded 8 hours  
   after dilution.  
  NOTE: Aluminum reacts with carboplatin causing precipi[INVESTIGATOR_204623]; therefore, needles or  
 intravenous sets containing aluminum parts  that may come in  contact [CONTACT_204660]. 
 4.24 Adverse Effects: Consult the package insert for the most

date indicated on the package when stored between 2 
and 25°C (36 and 77°F). Protect from light.  
4.33  Preparation: Docetaxel must be combined with its 
supplied diluent (final concentration = 10mg/mL) and then 
further diluted prior to infusion. Docetaxel should be diluted 
in 0.9% Sodium Chloride for Injection, USP or 5% Dextrose Injection, USP to produce a final concentration of 0.3 to 0.74mg/mL. The fully prepared docetaxel infusion solution should be used within 4 hours (including the infusion 
duration).  
 NOTE: In order to minimize patient exposure to the 
plasticizer DEHP, which may be leached from PVC 
infusion bags or sets, the final docetaxel dilution for infusion 
should be stored in bottles (glass, polypropylene) or 
plastic (polypropylene, polyolefin) bags and administered 
through polyethylene-lined administration sets.  
 All patients should be premedicated with oral 
corticosteroids for 3 days starting 1 day prior to docetaxel administration in order to reduce the incidence and severity of fluid retention as well as the severity of 
hypersensitivity reactions.

 6.1 Individual Dose Modification Levels 
 
All modifications are relative to the actual starting doses for the specific 
regimen. For application of individual  dose modifications, see specific 
guidelines below. Allowable drug dose levels and instructions are 
summarized in Tables A, B, C, and D. 
   
 General Guidelines for Hematologic Toxicity (Section 6.2) 
 Hematologic Nadirs, Table A (Section 6.3)

 6.[ADDRESS_244223] of cycle delay and/or  
   dose reduction as directed. 
 
   6.22  Treatment decisions will be based on the absolute neutrophil  
   count (ANC) rather than the total white cell count (WBC). 
 
6.23 Lower Limits for ANC and Platelet Count  
 
6.231 Cytotoxic Chemotherapy -     
Courses of treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy (carboplatin, paclitaxel, docetaxel) will not begin until the ANC is ≥ 1000 cells/mm
3 (CTCAE Grade 1) and the 
platelet count is ≥ 75,000/mm3. All treatment will be 
delayed for a maximum of three weeks until these values are achieved. Patients who fail to recover adequate counts within a three-week delay will no longer receive protocol-directed cytotoxic therapy. 
  
6.24  Use of Hematopoietic Cytokines and Protective Agents 
 The use of hematopoietic cytokines and protective reagents 
are restricted as noted:  
 
11-GYN-098-MCC 256.241 In general, patients will NOT receive prophylactic 
filgrastim (G-CSF), PEG-filgrastim (Neulasta), or 
sargramostim (GM-CSF) unless they experience 
treatment delays or recurrent neutropenic 
complications after treatment modifications as specified. In particular, hematopoietic growth factors should not be used to avoid initial chemotherapy dose modifications as stipulated in the protocol. However, patients may also receive growth factors for 
management of neutropenic complications in 
accordance with the NCCN clinical treatment guidelines and facility standard of care treatment practices (note: Neulasta may be administered on the same day as the chemotherapy if prescribed by [CONTACT_71599]).  
6.242 Patients will NOT receive prophylactic thrombopoietic 
agents unless they experience recurrent Grade 4 
thrombocytopenia after treatment modifications as specified below.  
6.243 Patients should not receive erythropoietin (EPO).  
Patients may receive iron supplements, and/or transfusions as clinically indicated for management of 
anemia.  
6.244 Patients may NOT receive amifostine or other 
protective reagents.  
6.25  Dose Modifications for Paclitaxel and Docetaxel  
 There will be no dose modifications for paclitaxel based on 
 hematologic toxicity. Dose modifications for docetaxel (if  substituted for paclitaxel according to protocol guidelines)  for hematologic toxicity should be made according to 
 parameters below in Table A, Table B and Table C. 
6.3 Modifications for Hematologic Toxicity (Nadirs)  
6.31 Initial occurrence of dose-limiting neutropenia (defined in 
 6.32) or dose limiting thrombocytopenia (defined in 6.33) will  be handled according to Table A, using the regimen  modifications in Table B.   
6.32 Dose-Limiting Neutropenia (DLT-ANC) is defined by [CONTACT_204662] 4 
neutropenia persisting ≥ 7 days, delay of treatment for more 
than 7 days because of neutropenia, ANC of 1000-1499 cells/mcl on day 1. There w ill be no modifications for 
uncomplicated Grade 4 neutropenia lasting less than 7 
 
11-GYN-098-MCC 26days. Febrile neutropenia is defined within the CTCAE as 
fever with or without  clinically or microbiologically 
documented infection with ANC less than 1,000 /mm3 and 
fever greater than or equal to 38.5°C. 
 
6.33 Dose-limiting thrombocytopenia (DLT-PLT) is defined by [CONTACT_204663] 4 thrombocytopenia (<25,000/mm3) or 
bleeding associated with Grade 3 thrombocytopenia (25,000 to <50,000/mm
3), delay of treatment on day 1 of a cycle by 
[CONTACT_726] 7 days because of thrombocytopenia. There will be no modifications for uncomplicated Grade 3 thrombocytopenia.

11-GYN-098-MCC 27 6.4 Modifications for Delayed Hematologic Recovery:  
6.41  Delay on the basis of neutropenia (Delay-ANC) is defined if 
 the ANC is less than 1,000 cells/mm3 (CTCAE Grade 2 or 
 worse) within 24 hours prior to scheduled therapy, or less than  1,000 cells/ mm
3, if the patient received G-CSF during the 
 previous cycle.  
6.42  Delay on the basis of thrombocytopenia (Delay-PLT) is 
 defined if the platelet count is less than 75,000/mm3 within 24 
 hours prior to scheduled therapy.  
6.43  Modifications noted below are only required for management 
 of delays in the absence of dose reductions stipulated by [CONTACT_204664]-ANC and/or DLT-PLT (as noted above).  In other words, if  the patient experiences DLT-ANC and Delay-ANC, make the  modifications as indicated for the nadir counts without 
 additional modifications based on delayed recovery.

 Table D should be used for dose level modifications for non-hematologic 
 toxicity only as indicated specifically in the sections below.   
 
  6.51 Grade 2 (or greater) peripheral neuropathy requires reduction  
   of one  dose level in paclitaxel and delay in all subsequent  
   protocol-directed therapy for a maximum of three weeks until     recovered to Grade 1. If peripheral neuropathy fails to recover     to Grade 1 by a maximum delay of three weeks from time     therapy is due, then paclitaxel should be withheld from all  
   subsequent chemotherapy cycles and docetaxel at the starting  
   dose level of 75 mg/m
2 substituted for paclitaxel unless   
   medically contraindicated.  
 In such cases where docetaxel has been substituted for  paclitaxel, if CTCAE Grade 3 or 4 peripheral neuropathy  occurs during or after the firs t cycle of docetaxel substitution 
 then subsequent doses of docetaxel will be delayed for a  maximum of three weeks until recovered to CTCAE Grade   2. If peripheral neuropathy fails to recover to Grade  2 by a  maximum delay of three weeks from time therapy is due,  then all docetaxel should be withheld from all subsequent 
 chemotherapy cycles.  
There will be no dose modifications in Carboplatin for 
neurotoxicity. 
 
  6.52 Renal toxicity (associated with reduction in GFR) is not   
   expected as a direct complication of chemotherapy in this  
   untreated patient population using the prescribed dose and     schedule of each regimen. As such, there are no specific dose     modifications for renal toxicity. However, the target AUC dose     of carboplatin must be recalculated each cycle in any patient     who develops renal insufficiency, defined by [CONTACT_204665] 1.5 x institutional upper limit normal (ULN).

11-GYN-098-MCC 318.0 EVALUATION CRITERIA 
 
 Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the
 international criteria proposed by [CONTACT_204666] (RECIST  v1.0 ) Committee.[ADDRESS_244229] diameter 
 (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions are used in the RECIST  criteria. Note: Lesions are either measurable or non-measurable using the 
 criteria provided below. The term “evaluable” in reference to measurability  will not be used because it does not provide additional meaning or accuracy. 
 
 8.[ADDRESS_244230] one dimension (longest diameter to be 
 recorded) as ≥ 20 mm with conventional techniques (CT, MRI, 
 x-ray) or as ≥ [ADDRESS_244231] be reco rded in millimeters (or decimal 
 fractions of centimeters). 
   8.12 Non-Measurable Disease      All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions     (longest diameter <20 mm with conventional techniques or <[ADDRESS_244232] scan), are considered non-measurable  
   disease. Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites,  
   pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis,     inflammatory breast disease, abdominal masses (not followed     by [CONTACT_462]), and cystic lesions are all non-measurable.  
  8.13 Target Lesions 
 
All measurable lesions, up to a maximum of five lesions per organ, and 10 lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions and recorded and measured at baseline. Target lesions should be selected on 
the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter) and 
their suitability for accurate repeated measurements (either by [CONTACT_14217]). A sum of the longest diameter (LD) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum LD. The baseline sum LD will be used as 
reference by [CONTACT_204667]. 
   8.14 Non-target lesions     All other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as  
   non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline.  
   Non-target lesions include measurable lesions that exceed the     maximum numbers per organ or total of all involved organs as     well as non-measurable lesions. Measurements of these  
 
11-GYN-098-MCC 32   lesions are not required but the presence or absence of each  
   should be noted throughout follow-up.  
 8.2 Guidelines for Evaluation of Measurable Disease 
 
  8.21 Method of Measurement     8.211 General Aspects of Tumor Measurement  
    All measurements should be taken and recorded in  
    metric notation using a ruler or calipers. All baseline      evaluations should be performed as closely as possible      to the beginning of treatment and never more than 4      weeks before the beginning of the treatment. 
    Note: Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously  
    irradiated area might or might not be considered   
    measurable.      The same method of assessment and the same   
    technique should be used to characterize each   
    identified and reported lesion at baseline and during      follow-up. Imaging-based evaluation is preferred to      evaluation by [CONTACT_204668]-tumor effect of a      treatment. 
 
   8.212 Specific Methods of Tumor Measurement  
     8.2121 Clinical lesions. Clinical lesions will only be  
     considered measurable when they are superficial 
     (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes). In 
     the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_204669], including a ruler to estimate the       size of the lesion, is recommended.

     the study is objective response evaluation, US  
     should not be used to measure tumor lesions. It       is, however, a possible alternative to clinical       measurements of superficial palpable lymph  
     nodes, subcutaneous lesions, and thyroid   
     nodules. US might also be useful to confirm the  
     complete disappearance of superficial lesions       usually assessed by [CONTACT_12148].

11-GYN-098-MCC 34 8.3 Response Criteria  
 
  8.31  Evaluation of Target Lesions 
 
   8.311 Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all       target lesions      8.312  Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in      the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference  
    the smallest sum LD  recorded since the treatment  
    started or the appearance of one or more  new lesions 
 
    8.313  Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to  
    qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD,  
    taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the  
    treatment started 
 
  8.32 Evaluation of non-target lesions  
    8.321  Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non- 
    target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level     Note: If serum CA-[ADDRESS_244235] normalize for a patient to      be considered in complete clinical response.  
   8.322 Incomplete Response: 
  
     8.3221 Stable Disease (SD): Persistence of one or more 
     non-target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor      marker level above the normal limits 
          8.3222 Progressive Disease (PD): Appearance of one  
     or more new lesions and/or unequivocal        progression of existing non-target lesions 
 
     Although a clear progression of “non-target”  
     lesions only is exceptional, in such    
     circumstances the opi[INVESTIGATOR_204625].       8.[ZIP_CODE] Progression Based On Serum CA- 
       125 
       Progression can be based upon         serum CA-125, only during the         period following completion of         cytotoxic chemotherapy, if one of         the three conditions are met: 
 
 
11-GYN-098-MCC [ADDRESS_244236] response recorded from     the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence  
   (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest  
   measurements recorded since the treatment started). The     patient's best response assignment will depend on the      achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

Target Lesions Non-Target Lesions New Lesions Overall Response 
CR CR No CR 
CR Incomplete 
response/SD No PR 
PR Non-PD No PR 
SD Non-PD No SD PD Any Yes or No PD 
Any PD Yes or No PD 
Any Any Yes PD 
Note:  
X Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring 
discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of 
disease progression at that time should be classified as having “symptomatic deterioration.” 
Every effort should be made 
to document the objective progression, even after 
discontinuation of treatment. 
X In some circumstances, it may be difficult to distinguish residual 
disease from normal tissue. When the evaluation of complete 
response depends on this determination, it is recommended that the residual lesion be investigated (e.g., fine needle 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]/biopsy) before confirming the complete response status. 
X In rare cases when there is evidence of disease on CT, MRI or 
physical examination, a discrepancy may exist between trends 
in CA125 levels and data from either imaging or physical examination. If there is evidence of disease on CT, MRI or physical examination, such disease is shrinking, and there is no 
evidence of new disease, then rising CA125 levels according to Section 8.[ZIP_CODE] would be insufficient to determine disease progression.  
X Patients who are not evaluated fo r response will be classified as 
either: having no target lesions at the time of enrollment onto the 
study, not reassessed due to early death, or unknown (not 
assessable, or insufficient data), 
  8.4 Confirmatory Measurement/Duration of Response
 
 
11-GYN-098-MCC [ADDRESS_244237] met 
 8.42  Duration of Overall Response 
 The duration of overall response is measured from the time  measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first  recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive 
 disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for 
 progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the  treatment started). 
 The duration of overall CR is measured from the time 
 measurement criteria are first met for CR until the first date that 
 recurrent disease is objectively documented. 
 
 8.[ADDRESS_244238]. 
The time to progression will be determined by [CONTACT_15327]. 
   The defined date of dise ase progression will depend on 
   the method of determination as follows: 
   8.[ADDRESS_244239] a 20% increase in the sum of the    LD of target lesions, the appearance of one or more 
   new lesions, or unequivocal progression of existing  
   non-target lesions, the date of progression will be     defined as the date such lesions were first found to be    progressed by [CONTACT_204670]. 
   8.[ADDRESS_244240] date of the initial CA125 of greater than or equal 
   to two times the nadir value or upper limit of normal, 
   whichever of these is applicable. Given that imaging    using the same modality and encompassing the same    field as in the initial pretreatment evaluation is required    within 2 weeks of the confirmatory (second) CA125    value, if imaging criteria are met for progression, then 
   the date of progression would be defined as the date of 
   the imaging study. 
   8.53  Recurrence-Free Survival (patients with no measurable  
   disease) is the period from study entry until disease recurrence,    death or date of last contact. 
  8.54 Subjective Parameters including performance status,  
  specific symptoms, and side effects are graded according to   the CTCAE v4.0. 
 
  Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using  
  the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), v1.0.

11-GYN-098-MCC 4111.0  BIOLOGIC STUDIES 
 
 11.1   Collection and handling of specimens 
 
One serum sample ([ADDRESS_244243] tube) and one plasma (5 ml EDTA 
containing tube) sample will be obtained at three time points:  1) Before the first cycle of chemotherapy is adm inistered; 2) Immediately prior to 
surgery after neoadjuvant therapy is completed; and 3) within 24-72 hours after surgery.  Serum levels of cytokine (TNF, TNF receptor II, IL-6 and 
IL-8) and CRP will be determined and plasma levels of oxidative modified 
proteins will be measured and the resulting adducted proteins will be identified. Samples will be collected and stored by [CONTACT_204672].  
 11.2   Collection and handling of tumor specimens    
Tumor tissue (approximately 2 gms) will be saved at the time of surgery and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen.

11-GYN-098-MCC 4212.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
 12.1 Study Design 
 
 This study is a single arm feasib ility study of neoadjuvant chemotherapy 
with interval surgical debulking in patients with advanced ovarian, fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_8916], and primary peritoneal carcinoma to determine the percentage of patients that achieve maximal surgical debulking as defined by [CONTACT_204673] a Simon’s 2-stage 
design.
[ADDRESS_244245] important prognostic factor in advanced ovarian carcinoma.
5,20,41,42,43 Using 
previous results from the larger European study of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, 51.2% of patients in the neoadjuvant arm achieved maximal surgical debulking as compared to 19.4% of patients in the 
primary debulking control arm.
[ADDRESS_244246] of a single proportion with 90% power and a two-sided type I error 
rate equal to 0.[ADDRESS_244247] the same improvement in the percentage of neoadjuvant chemotherapy patients achieving maximal surgical 
debulking as compared to the European controls is 9 patients. The 
trial will be terminated if 2 or fewer patients achieve maximal surgical debulking as defined by [CONTACT_204648]. If the trial continues to the second stage, an additional 14 patients will be enrolled for a total of 23. Conservatively allowing 20% drop out or loss to follow up, we plan to enroll [ADDRESS_244248] 95% 
binomial confidence interval.  A chi-square test for one proportion will be 
employed to test the null hypothesis that the percentage of subjects achieving maximal surgical debulking is equal to 19.4%. Various partial response rates (i.e. proportion of patients with various sizes of residual tumor after debulking) will also be estimated along with exact 95% binomial confidence intervals. We plan to explore options to adjust results 
for the two-stage design. Analyses of secondary outcomes will include 
Kaplan-Meier mean estimates of overall and progression-free survival rates. This will be primarily descriptive in nature due to the small patient 
 
11-GYN-098-MCC 43numbers; however, these results will be compared against historical US 
controls as well as the larger European study45,20. 
 There will also be information collected on any adverse events, surgical outcomes, biomarkers, and quality of life (QOL) surveys. Toxicities will be graded according to Common Toxicity Criteria (CTCAE) v4.0.  Incidence tables will be generated to summarize incidence of patients reporting at least one epi[INVESTIGATOR_181600], incidence of adverse events causing withdrawal, and incidence of serious adverse events. 
Descriptive statistics (means, stand ard deviations, medians, and ranges) 
will be calculated for quality of life survey outcomes collected throughout 
the study at baseline, 9, 10, 19, and 28 weeks. Percent change in scores from baseline to each of the weeks collected will be calculated for each patient and plots will be constructed to show trends over time for mean 
scores. 
 
The requested biospecimens from 28 patients will be used for the following purposes and analysis: i) correlation between several inflammation and oxidative stress markers (measured up/down regulated) using the Kappa statistic ; ii) comparisons of biomarker 
status (measured up/down regulated) using McNemar’s test for paired pre vs. post-
treatment samples; and iii) estimating association of each marker (up versus down-regulated) with survival time using Kapl an-Meier survival curves, estimating tumor 
response using proportions and chi-square or Fisher’s exact test for comparison of 
proportions between up vs. down-regulated and two-group comparisons of QOL variables measured quantitatively using either two-sample t-tests or nonparametric 
analogs between each level (up/down regulated) of each marker.  The patient numbers 
will be adequate for detecting moderate/large correlations for the (i) analysis while analyses (ii) and (iii) will be primarily exploratory.

    of one or both ovaries; or with capsule(s) ruptured; or with  
    ascites present containing malignant cells or with positive      peritoneal washings.  Stage III  Tumor involving one or both ovaries with peritoneal implants outside the    pelvis and/or positive retroperitoneal or inguinal nodes. Superficial liver  
  metastasis equals Stage III.  Tumor is limited to the true pelvis but with  
  histologically verified malignant ext ensions to small bowel or omentum. 
 Stage IIIA  Tumor grossly limited to the true pelvis with negative nodes but with   histologically confirmed microscopic seeding of abdominal peritoneal  
  surfaces

Stage IIIB  Tumor of one or both ovaries with histologically confirmed implants of 
  abdominal peritoneal surfaces, none exceeding 2 cm in diameter. Nodes   negative.  Stage IIIC  Abdominal implants >2 cm in diameter and/or positive retroperitoneal  
  or inguinal nodes.  
 
11-GYN-098-MCC 50Stage IV  Growth involving one or both ovaries with distant metastasis. If pleural  
  effusion is present there must be positive cytologic test results to allot a    case to Stage IV. Parenchymal liver metastasis equals Stage IV. 
 
* In order to evaluate the impact on prognosis of the different criteria for allotting cases to Stage IC or IIC, it would be of value to know if rupture of the capsule was (1) spontaneous or (2) caused by [CONTACT_204679] (1) peritoneal washings or (2) ascites.

CARBOPLATIN DOSE CALCULATION INSTRUCTION 
 
1) The Cockcroft-Gault formula will be used in GOG trials (not the Jelliffe formula).  2) Conversion of IDMS creatinine levels to “non-IDMS” values will not be permitted.  3) The carboplatin calculation tool on the GOG website has been updated. A legacy 
 carboplatin calculator (using the Jelliffe formula and IDMS to “non-IDMS” 
 conversion) is also available, if needed for dose modifications (see below). 
 
Dosing of Carboplatin:  
1) The carboplatin dose will be calculated to reach a target area under the curve 
 (AUC) according to the Calvert formula using an estimated glomerular filtration rate  (GFR) from the Cockcroft-Gault formula.  2) The initial dose of carboplatin must be calculated using GFR. In the absence of 
 renal toxicity greater than or equal to CTCAE Grade 2 (serum creatinine >1.[ADDRESS_244249]) or toxicity requiring dose modification, the dose of carboplatin will not need 
 to be recalculated for subsequent cycles, but will be subject to dose modification  for toxicity as noted in the protocol.  3) Carboplatin doses will be based on the subject’s weight at baseline and will remain 
 the same throughout the study. However, the doses will be recalculated if the 
 patient has a weight change of greater than or equal to 10% from baseline.  4) In patients with an abnormally low serum creatinine (less than 0.7 mg/dl), the  creatinine clearance should be estimated using a minimum value of 0.7 mg/dl . If 
 a patient is currently being dosed using a creatinine value less than 0.7 mg/dl,  adjust dose with next planned treatment.  5) For trials where patients enter and are treated within less than or equal to 12  weeks of surgery: If a more appropriate (higher) baseline creatinine value is  available from the pre-operative period (within 4 weeks of surgery date), that value 
 may also be used for the initial estimation of GFR. 
  CALVERT FORMULA:    Carboplatin dose (mg) = target AUC x (GFR + 25)  
 
 NOTE: the GFR used in the Calvert formula should not exceed 125 ml/min.    Maximum carboplatin dose (mg) = target AUC (mg/ml x min) x 150 ml/min.  
 
 The maximum allowed doses of carboplatin are:  
 
 AUC6=900mg   AUC5=750mg  AUC4=600mg 
 
11-GYN-098-MCC 56 
 For the purposes of this protocol, the GFR is considered to be equivalent to the 
 estimated creatinine clearance. The estimated creatinine clearance (ml/min) is 
 calculated by [CONTACT_26306]-Gault using the following formula: 
 
 Creatinine Clearance (mL/min) = [140-Age (years)] x Weight (kg) x 0.85  
        72 x serum creatinine (mg/dl) 
Notes:   
1) Weight in kilograms (kg):   a. Body Mass Index (BMI) should be calculated for each patient. A BMI     calculator is available at the following link: http://www.nhlbisupport.com/bmi/  b. Actual weight should be used for estimation of GFR for patients with BMI of  
  less than 25.  
 c. Adjusted weight should be used for estimation of GFR for patients with BMI  
  of greater than or equal to 25 .  
  d. Adjusted weight calculation:  
  Ideal weight (kg) = (((Height (cm)/2.54) – 60) x 2.3) + 45.5 
 
  Adjusted weight (kg) = ((Actual weight – Ideal weight) x 0.40) + Ideal  
  weight 
  e. If a patient with BMI of greater than or equal to [ADDRESS_244250] dose with next planned treatment.  2) The Cockcroft-Gault formula above is specifically for women (it includes the 0.85  factor).  
 
At the time of a dose modification for toxicity : 
 1)   If the creatinine at the time of a dose modification is lower than the creatinine used  to calculate the previous dose, use the previous (higher) creatinine; if the  creatinine at the time of a dose modification is higher than the creatinine used to 
 calculate the previous dose, use the current (higher) creatinine. This will ensure 
 that the patient is actually receiving a dose reduction.  2)  If the dose of carboplatin (mg) at the time of dose modification, is higher than the  previous dose due to the use of the Cockcroft-Gault formula [when the previous 
 dose was calculated using the Jelliffe formula and IDMS to “non-IDMS” conversion 
 (if applicable)+, use the same method that was used to calculate the previous dose  *Jelliffe formula and IDMS to “non-IDMS” conversion (if applicable)], to calculate  the dose of carboplatin (mg) at the time of dose reduction. A legacy carboplatin  calculator is available on the GOG website for this purpose. This will ensure that 
 the patient is actually receiving a dose reduction.

Standards for Operative Note Details 
 
Surgeon is responsible for indicating the extent of surgical cytoreduction in operative 
findings in dictated operative report.  Detail must include one of the following statements regarding the extent of surgical cytoreduction:   “Maximal surgical cytoreduction”  No evidence of gross residual  
       d i s e a s e  
  “Optimal surgical cytoreduction”  ≤ 1cm gross residual disease* 
  “Suboptimal surgical cytoreduction”   > 1cm gross residual disease* 
 *For any evidence of gross residual disease, surgeons must specify the location of residual disease and approximate amount or si ze of residual disease, preferably with 
measurements (i.e., “5 cm tumor plaque in left upper quadrant”), but alternatively with anatomical description (ie, “coating entire right hemidiaphragm” or “confluent disease 
throughout majority of small bowel mesentery”).

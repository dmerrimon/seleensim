Objec�ve : The objec�ve of this study is  to evaluate the eﬀec�veness of 38% Silver Diammine 
Fluoride (SDF) in arres�ng ini�al non -cavitated approximal carious lesion in adults aged 21 -64 years 
u�lizing three methods: pairwise comparison of individua l radiographs, visual assessment of subtrac�on 
radiograph s and histogram analysis of subtrac�on radiographs .  
Design : This study is a randomized, triple -blinded,  and placebo -controlled clinical trial 
(ClinicalTrials.gov identiﬁer -[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). The stu dy popula�on consist ed of adults aged 21 -64 years 
old who are seeking care at the University of Iowa , College of Den�stry  and Dental Clinics . Eligib ility for 
the study include s having at least one ini�al non -cavitated approximal posterior carious lesion 
(Radiol ogic scores RA1, RA2, or RA3 using the Interna�onal Caries Classiﬁca�on and Management 
System (ICCMS) scoring system) that wa s in contact [CONTACT_72589] -restored tooth surface.  
Methods : Consented subjects will be  randomly assigned to one of the two study arms , either 
treatment ( 38% SDF solu�on) or placebo (water) designated as solu�ons “A” and “B”. Par�cipants  will 
complete  beverage intake  and caries risk ques�onnaires  at baseline and 12 months .  The selected les ion 
will be  followed at 6 and 12 months . A bitewing radiograph will be  made at baseline u�lizing a bite 
registra�on holder to insure close geometrical alignment of subsequent follow up radiographs. Lesion 
progression will be  monitored radiographically through three methods: pairwise comp arison of 
individual radiographs, visual assessment of subtrac�on radiograph s and histogram analysis of 
subtrac�on radiographs .  
Sta�s�cal  Analysis Plan:  The primary outcome of interest is wh ether there is caries progression 
based upon radiographic evalua�on, eva luated at 12 months , for the two study arms . The analy�c 
approach, which will u�lize binary logis�c regression modeling for correlated data, will consider  the 
dependencies (correla�ons am ong data points) that typi[INVESTIGATOR_72588]. For analyses 
targe�ng a speciﬁc �me point, this is not a concern, because there is only a single measurement per 
individual, and standard binary logis�c regression methods can be applied. A  widely accepted method to 
deal with these types of dependenc ies is using generalized es�ma�ng equa�ons (GEE) . We will also 
consider mixed modeling approaches as part of these inves�ga�ons as appropriate. Model selec�on will 
be guided  by [CONTACT_72590]’s criterion and its modiﬁca�ons ; par�cular considera�ons will be given to 
selec�on of the covariance structure addressing data dependencies, for which approaches have been 
developed in both the GEE and mixed modeling contexts . A primary goal in all analyses will be to 
formally compare the two treatment arms and, in doing so, to obtain es�mates of eﬀect sizes and 
associated variability for the planning of future trials. Throughout, the primary covariate of interest will 
be treatment arm; the eﬀects of covariates including pa�ent demographics, dietary intakes and behaviors, other aspects of caries risk assessment, and caries score (DMFT/DMFS) as a measure of disease burden and risk will also be assessed. All analyse s will be carried out in accordance with 
inten�on -to-treat principles.   The analyses just described will provide es�mates of treatment eﬀects and 
associated measures of variability to assist in planning a future deﬁni�ve trial. In addi�on, atri�on rates 
will be es�mated,  and 95% conﬁdence intervals will be construct ed for each �me point and treatment 
arm.   Because there is evidence that silver diamine ﬂuoride is also a preven�ve agent, assessment of 
diﬀerences in incident caries between the two treatment groups is of par�cular interest as a secondary 
aim. We will consider measures reﬂec�ng the development of new lesions, considering issues of tooth 
erup�on and loss between examina�ons (caries increment) . The crude caries increment will be 
supplemented with net caries increment allowing for examiner reversals, and with the adjusted caries 
increment. Poisson models, or Poisson models augmented with an over dispersion parameter or an 
extension to account for zero count inﬂa�on, have generally been found useful for exami ning the 
rela�onships between counts of aﬀected teeth or surfaces,  and can be applied to incident disease while 
accoun�ng for correlated outcomes, including correla�ons among surfaces or subgroups of surfaces 
within an individual . Alterna� ves, such as the nega�ve binomial model, are available if the Poisson is not 
appropriate . We note that linear regression approaches have some�mes been appropriately used to 
model caries increment . Candidate independent variables are as des cribed above.   Inter -and intra -rater 
reliability will be assessed for both radiographic and clinical measures of progression, using intraclass correla�ons for quan�ta�ve outcomes, and kappa sta�s�cs for categorical outcomes; weighted kappa 
will be used  for ordinal categorical measures. Rela�onships between radiographic and clinical measures 
of progression will be assessed, using Spearman rank correla�on when the two measures being compared are ordinal or quan�ta�ve. Binary outcomes (presence or absence of progression) will be 
assessed using McN emar’s  test (or the exact binomial test if appropriate); in this instance, evalua�on of 
the level agreement of the two approaches will also be assessed using unweighted kappa. Descrip�ve 
sta�s�cs and graphi cs will further illustrate any iden�ﬁed rela�onships.

3)   Abstract:   Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has emerged as a highly efficacious 
treatment for addressing basal ganglia disorders [14-16, 61]  such as Parkinson dis ease, 
essential tremor, and dystonia. Recently, groups including the UF Center for 
Movement Disorders and Neurorestoration have applied DBS for the treatment of OCD and TS [10-12, 59] . Although three brain targets have been tested in open- label 
series, one, the centromedian (CM) thalam us-parafascicular complex, has to date the 
greatest number of documented cases revealing significant improvements in motor tics). The globus pallidus interna (GPi) and the anterior limb of the internal capsule (ALIC)/nucleus accumbens have also emerged as potentially effective areas for 
amelioration of medication refractory tics, however they have been less studied [24, 
49]. The CM target was chosen for this study as we believe it will have the greatest 
chance to yield positive efficacy and safety data (specific aim 1), and will also provide a target where physiological changes related to moto r tics are likely to be 
discovered (specific aim 2) [59]. The University of [LOCATION_012] uses the CM thalamic 
region target for Tourette DBS.   The reason that this target was chosen for this 
protocol was that our center has used the target and developed preliminary safety and efficacy data.   This target also is the most commonly used worldwide, and we track 
all side effects of all global implants in the International Tourette Deep Brain

pulling (capsule) and blurry vision.  These are reversible with programming changes.  
We will assess the effectiveness of chronic (continuous) stimulation of the CM thalamic region for suppressing mot or tics in TS (specific aim 1).  The Medtronic 
Summit RC+S device and cortical ECOG strips (
Model [ZIP_CODE] ) can record local field 
potentials (LFPs), and can be programmed to detect specific electrographic patterns. The device allows physiology to be recorded  even after internalization of the 
hardware. The physiology underlying TS will be examined in specific aim 2. Additionally, in specific aim [ADDRESS_950522] from electrocorticography (ECOG) leads ( Medtronic Model [ZIP_CODE] cortical strip) which will be placed over the 
pre-motor and motor cerebral cortex.  These studies will enhance our understanding 
of the pathophysiology of the disease and will help in developi[INVESTIGATOR_700183].  The experimental design will facilitate stimulation in the CM region, and recording from the ECOG.  The presence of a detectable physiological change in 
CM or from the ECOG (specific aim 2) will allow for the experimental use of a 
closed loop DBS system, where a tic is detected on the ECOG, an d a stimulation 
pulse is delivered in the CM region (specific aim 3).  
4)   Background :  Tourette syndrome (TS) is a chronic neurodevelopmental disorder

PI [CONTACT_15261] :9/23/2019 4 characterized by [CONTACT_700209], typi[INVESTIGATOR_700184] [1-5].  
The syndrome is commonly associated with other neuropsychiatric comorbidities (e.g. 
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive compulsive features (OCD), 
and other behavioral manifestations). In the majority of TS cases the motor manifestations can be managed using a combination of TS e ducation, comprehensive 
behavioral intervention for tics (CBIT), and/or a variety of medications, and behavioral therapy [5, 6]. The natural history of TS has revealed that most patients will experience 
significant improvement of tics in late adolescence or early adulthood[ 5, 6].  However, 
experts now recognize that there is a subset of patients who will continue to experience disabling tics despi[INVESTIGATOR_700185].  For these severely affected patients, deep brain stimulation (DBS) has the potential to improve refractory and disabling tics [7]. 
DBS has been well established as a treatment for Parkinson’s disease, essential 
tremor, dystonia, and OCD, and has achieved full approval, or a humanitarian device exemption for each of these indications.[ 8-18]  There have been many DBS studies 
and position papers detailing careful and meticulous techniques for screening patients [19-21].    
DBS,  though a minimally invasive therapy, still has associated risks, and DBS failure 
can result in medical complications and this endpoint can have economic consequences [22]. Patient selection and management can likely improve the risk -
benefit ratio for individual sufferers and this will likely apply to TS DBS [23]. The 
importance of pre -operative assessment, patient selection, DBS team expertise, DBS 
team experience, and post -operative management has been shown to be important,

IRB Project # : 201300850 
PI [CONTACT_15261] :9/23/[ADDRESS_950523] been DBS 
failures [22, 23].  Since TS is a childhood onset disorder, often w ith complex clinical 
features, a waxing and waning course, and frequent neuropsychiatric comorbidities [5], the evaluation of patients has a level of complexity greater than 
many of the other current DBS indications[ 23]. During the evaluation period there is 
also a risk that tics may be falsely under - or over-quantified due to frequent changes 
in tic manifestations, and effects of social context. The first attempted surgeries for TS were ablations (i.e. lesions) placed in the thalamus and these were performed by [CONTACT_700210] [24]. In 1999, Visser- Vandewalle reported the first case of 
thalamic DBS for TS [25]. Since this report, multiple groups have observed 
improvement with DBS despi[INVESTIGATOR_700186] [25-
43]. 
 
Most early TS DBS studies consisted of either single case reports or small case series (Level of Evidence IV), and these reports had widely variable methodological and outcome reporting[ 23]. Since the initial reports and guidelines there has been an 
explosion in the field of international publications reporting both DBS successes and failures .. In 2005, the TSA hosted a meeting of internationally recognized experts to 
develop recommendations to guide research and early use of DBS in TS[ 44].    
Additionally, a collaborative international network of investigators was established, and in 2010-11 the TSA commissioned an International Database of Deep Brain Stimulation Studies in Tourette Syndrome (TSA DBS Registry, 
http://tsa -
usa.org/dbs/ ), which has been recently launched.  The major update since [ADDRESS_950524] # : 201300850  
PI [CONTACT_15261] :9/23/[ADDRESS_950525] been many reported successful cases below the age of 25[ 37, 42] . 
5)   Purpose :  The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the effectiveness and 
safety of a possible new treatment for TS. The Medtronic Summit R C+S device and 
cortical ECOG strips ( Medtronic Model [ZIP_CODE] cortical strip ) can be programmed to 
record physiology and to provide chronic (continuous stimulation), or alternatively responsive stimulation to deep brain structures.  
 
Specifically, this investigation will:  
(1)  Test the hypothesis that centromedian (C M) continuous brain stimulation 
will be an effective and safe method for the treatment of tics in medication refractory TS.  There is now a growing body of evidence supporting the use of DBS 
for tic suppression. Implantable brain stimulators provide a rever sible and 
programmable solution to neuromodulation which are safer (no tissue destruction) and potentially more effective than ablative techniques such as thalamotomy, capsulotomy, and cingulotomy, especially because they can be performed bilaterally [62]. There are however important issues that may limit standard DBS 
effectiveness in this population including specific problems unique to this group of patients including the paroxysmal nature of the disorder. It would be desirable to design a therapy such as the one proposed in this grant application to neuromodulate only when needed (closed loop or responsive therapy). We plan to implant CM

PI [CONTACT_15261] :9/23/2019 7 thalamus and cortical ECOG bilaterally in 10 medication refractory TS subjects. We 
will employ a prospective blinded s taggered onset design. We hypothesize that by 
[CONTACT_2329] a chronic (continuous) stimulation strategy we will be able to achieve a greater than 40% reduction (over 6 months) in total tics (motor and phonic on the YGTSS) in more than ½ of our subjects (6/10). We will in this study assess safety and also employ stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_700187].  
(2)  Define the intra -operative and post -operative physiological changes seen in 
TS. We hypothesize that there will be rate and pattern changes in the physiology that  
will correlate with the clinical manifestation of motor and phonic tics. Following 
implantation and internalization of hardware, the device used in this study will be 
able to record physiology (i.e. the LFP). This unique feature is not currently available  
for other FDA approved brain stimulation devices (Medtronic PC and SC, Minneapolis, Minn), and the option will allow our team to document physiology, and 
to measure, using videotape analysis, electromyogram, and position sensors placed on muscles and areas of the body that exhibit tics, and we will attempt physiological correlation using LPS’s from the CM region and from ECOGs. We have recently discovered band specific frequencies [59] in thalamic LFPs , and these frequencies 
emerged after therapeutic DBS in a small cohort of human TS subjects. We quantified increases in gamma oscillations and their correlations with improvement of TS symptomatology, and found that those subjects obtaining the best clini cal outcome 
from thalamic DBS exhibited the greatest gamma power changes [59]. Thus, the 
correlation between gamma band activity and clinical tic scores supports the th eory 
that thalamic gamma band dynamics [59] are correlated with improved

PI [CONTACT_15261] :9/23/[ADDRESS_950526] critical step in ne urosensing 
and responsive neuromodulation. The neurostimulator (Medtronic Summit R C+S 
device and cortical ECOG strips ( Model [ZIP_CODE]) is novel in that it can be can be 
programmed to provide continuous or responsive stimulation. Both deep brain and cortical ECOG strips will be placed as part of this system. We will collect real time, local field potentials (LFPs) that are time synchronized with clinical behavior, and we 
will collect these from both the CM region and from pre -motor and motor cortex in 
order to  study thalamocortical interactions in the context of human TS. The collection 
of these potentials will allow us to better understand the fundamental neural activity important to tic generation (specific aim 2), and to attempt responsive stimulation approa ch (specific aim 3). Our proposal will uncover the neuronal activity inherent to 
CM and from cerebral cortex, and will reveal how DBS affects this activity in the human TS patient. 
(3)  Test the hypothesis that responsive brain stimulation will provide an 
alternative to chronic deep brain stimulation in TS.  We hypothesize that we will 
be able to use physiological changes collected in Specific Aim [ADDRESS_950527] # : 201300850  
PI [CONTACT_15261] :9/23/2019 9 therapy for TS patients. This paradigm is preferable to chronic stimulation for its 
potential to reduce stimulation -related side effects. Outcomes will be measured by 
[CONTACT_700211] (Specific Aim 1) to an acute test of responsive stimulation (Specific Aim 3).  Responsive stimulation parameters 
will be identical to chronic continuous stimula tion parameters and will strictly be 
within safety ranges. If acute responsive stimulation leads to low side effects and 
comparable clinical outcomes for a patient, we will test chronic responsive stimulation for one week at a time, up to four weeks in total.  This procedure will be performed at an appropriate time point (approved by [CONTACT_079]) after the 6 month primary endpoint is reached but prior to Month 36 (study completion) (see visits 6.1- 6.4 in schedule of events).  The patient programmer will allow patients 
to turn off responsive stimulation and switch back to standard continuous therapy. A firmware update from Medtronic will allow the Summit RC +S intern al signal sensing 
and processing units to communicate with the stimulation unit. Outcomes for chronic responsive stimulation will also be measured by [CONTACT_700211].  
Duration of the Investigation: We expect the duration of this investigation will be five years. In the first year we plan to implant and follow the first two subjects. In Year [ADDRESS_950528] # : 201300850 
PI [CONTACT_15261] :9/23/[ADDRESS_950529] clinically for a minimum of 24 months following implant, and to follow them for 12 more months for a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 4 research visits, and then clinically each year as long as they 
wish to remain implanted, and to assess needs for battery replacement.  We plan to 
apply to CMS and Medicare for insurance coverage of the device implantation and battery replacement costs, and to apply to Medtronic for device donation (Medtronic has already reviewed this proposal in their scientific grants committee and approved donation of the devices and replacement devices). 
6)   Protocol :  Methodology to be used - The study will be a prospective blinded 
design. Subjects will include ten individuals with medication refractory and severely disabling TS. We expect to consent and screen 50 individuals in order to enroll ten. A total of 6/10 subjects (60%) will need to be “responders” as a result of the intervention (YGTSS motor tic subscale reduction of >40%) for this study to reach 
effectiveness criteria.

Recruitment: There are approximately 600 TS patients actively followed with yearly  
appointments at the UF Psychiatry and Movement Disorders clinics. An average of 
three new TS patients are evaluated each week for diagnosis and treatment options, and many are now referred to our institution for DBS based on our experiences with OCD and m ovement disorders. It is unknown how many TS patients are medication-
refractory. However, if we conservatively assume that 2.5 -5% of existing patients will 
be eligible for the study, that will result in a pool of approximately 20 -40 patients, 
plus an addit ional 4- 6 patients a year from referrals of new patients during the life of 
the grant. From this pool, we anticipate being able to recruit 10 patients (2- 3 per year) 
over 5 years to complete this study.  Subjects will be paid a $200 stipend, to be paid after each visit is complete, per visit (with exception of the post -implant visits, as it 
does not require a separate trip to our center) to help compensate for time and travel.  Unscheduled visits will be compensated if requested by [CONTACT_3476].  One  
unscheduled visit per calendar year will be compensated for patient -requested 
unscheduled visits, though there is no limit to how many they may request.  Additionally, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_700189], and receives TS DBS referrals from all over the

Subjects will be recruited in one of three ways: 1) the neurology clinic, 2) the 
psychiatry clinic, or 3) through referral by [CONTACT_700215]. We will also utilize an IRB (Institutional Review Board) approved database to recruit eligible patients from the TS population who are followed in the Movement Disorders Clinic at UF.  
Obtaining Informed Consent: Prior to any intervention, the principal investigator 
(PI), along with the neuropsychiatric study coordinator, will explain the protocol and study procedures as well as the risks and benefits of the surgical procedure, device 
related complications, medical related complications, and the risk of not obtaining the 
“perceived benefit” from surgery. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_700190] (if the subject consents and is implanted), including the alternatives of 1) continuing active stimulation at current settings, 2) 
continuing active stimulation but searching for new settings, 3) discontinuing stimulation, and 4) discontinuing stimulation and removing the device. If a subject continues to receive active stimulation at the conclusion of the study, the subject will be followed clinically by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_700191], or alternatively until the device is no longer available. The Summit 
programmer is unique to the device under study.  Commercially available programmers do not support the Summit system.  Therefore, at the conclusion of the subject’s participation , he or she  will be limited in clinical programming follow -up to 
institutions  (such as UF) who have the Summit programmer.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_700192]+S, due to the limited availability

Finally, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_700194] 1) continuing medical therapy, 2) entering a TS drug trial, 3) seeking behavioral interventions (HRT, etc.), and 4) entering other device related studies for TS that may be available such as for transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).  
7)   Research Plan:  This study will assess the safety and effectiveness of bilateral 
simultaneous implantation of CM DBS and ECOG for medication refractory TS. The 
primary effectiveness outcome variable for each subject will be a YGTSS total tic 
subscale reduction of >40%, and t he primary safety outcome will be defined as  the 
serious adverse event (SAE) rate using historical data published from Parkinson’s disease randomized trials [
13, 67-71]. The study will also examine the physiology 
associated with TS and tics, as well as explore the possibility of th e effectiveness of 
responsive stimulation.  
The study will follow a prospective blinded design. Effectiveness, tolerability, and 
safety will be assessed and the study will allow for exploration of appropriate programming parameters and physiology.  
Multidisciplinary Pre -Operative Screening and Evaluation:  The multidisciplinary 
pre-operative screening and evaluation will include four specialties: 1) movement 
disorders neurology, 2) psychiatry, 3) neurosurgery, and 4) neuropsychology. Details 
of the steps in the multidisciplinary pre -operative screening and evaluation are

examination. The diagnosis of TS will be made based on strict DSM- V criteria, and 
will be confirmed by [CONTACT_700216]. A psychiatrist will perform a psychiatric history and will be assisted by [CONTACT_700217]. The data and measures collected are listed below. 
General Demographics Sheet:  Each subject will be assigned an independent ID 
number (assigned by [CONTACT_9137]). The following information will be collected: age, disease duration, all medical comorbidities, all medications and dosages, family history, smoking history, alcohol history and substance abuse history.  
Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI):  
 The MINI will be used to 
provide DSM- V diagn oses. This is a clinician -administered comprehensive 
psychiatric assessment based on DSM -V criteria. This tool will provide a pre -
operative diagnosis of DSM-V Axis I disorders. The MINI is a brief structured 
diagnostive interview for the major psychiatric disorders that will typi[INVESTIGATOR_31228] [ADDRESS_950534] met inclusion criteria (i.e., all psychiatric co -morbidities identified and treated

diagnoses impart risk for post-operative mood changes.  
Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS):  The C -SSRS is a 
questionnaire that uses a rating scale assessment to determine if there is a risk of 
or presence of suicidal ideation or behavior.  
Quality of Life Assessment Scale (QOLAS): The QOLAS is a 10 -ite m interview 
designed to assess quality of life in 5 domains: physical, psychological, social/family, work, and cognitive.  The participant is asked to  rate quality of life in each domain at 
the beginning of the study, and these ratings are compared to those later in the study to measure change in quality of life.  
Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS):  
 The YGTSS is a semi -structured 
interview designed to assess tic presence and severity. Current motor and phonic tics are then rated separately according to number, frequency, intensity, complexity and interference on a 6 -point ordinal scale. The YGTSS has excellent inter -rater 
agreement, good psychometric properties, and is recommended for use in the Tourette Syndrome Association (TSA) DBS guidelines. 
Modified Rush Tic Rating Scale (MRTRS):  
 The MRTRS is a validated measure 
that examines five domains of impairment in TS. The scale allows for a videotape 
protocol, in which an independent blinded reviewer assesses tics by [CONTACT_700218]. Ratings of 0 -4 can be assigned on five disability 
categories: number of body areas, frequency of motor tics, frequency of phonic tics, severity of m otor tics, and severity of phonic tics. The sum of these ratings yields a 
total score of overall tic disability (0 -20). The videotapes for this study will be rated

SF-36: The SF -36 is a validated 36 question quality of life measure. The results will 
give an 8 -scale profile of functional health and well-being. The SF- 36 is a generic 
measure that does not target a specific disease.  
Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM -D) : The HAM -D is a semi -structu red 
clinician administered interview designed to measure a range of symptoms. The 
HAM -D consists of a 17-item questionnaire designed to evaluate depressed mood, the 
cognitive symptoms of depression, as well as the co-morbid symptoms of anxiety. 
Yale -B rown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y -BOCS): The Y -BOCS provides a 
quantitative measure of the symptoms of OCD. The Y- BOCS is a widely used and 
psychometrically sound clinician- rated, semi -structured interview assessing the OCD 
symptom severity. The Y- BOCS rates t he severity of obsessions and compulsions 
across five items and provides a total severity score. We will be using the 10 -item 
version which uses 5 items each for obsessive thoughts and compulsive behavior. 
This scale provides a quantitative measure of the severity of OCD on a scale of 0 to 40. 
Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS):  
 The YMRS is one of the most frequently 
utilized rating scales to assess manic symptoms. The scale has 11 items and is based 
on the patient’s subjective report of his or her clinical condition over the previous 48 hours. Additional information is based upon clinical observations made during the course of the clinical interview. Items specifically assess the following symptoms: elevated mood, elevated energy, increased sexuality, decrease in sleep, irritable and aggressive behavior, increased rate and amount of speech, language and thought

quantitative measure of the symptoms of mania on a scale of 0 to 60. 
Conner’s Short Version ADHD Scale Adults (CAARS) short form:  This is a 
multimodal assessment of the ADHD behaviors and problems in adults.  This is a short form survey that will take 10 minutes to administer and it will provide a baseline of ADHD symptoms including Inattention/Memory Problems, Impulsivity/Emotional Lability, Hyperactivity/Restlessness and Problems with Self -
Concept. 
Premonitory Urge for Tics Scale (PUTS):  
 This is a ten -item questionnaire to assess 
how much a Tourette patient feels an urge to tic and the intensity of the urge.  It takes 
about 7 minutes to administer.  Scores range from nine to thirty- six (item ten is not 
scored), with higher scores indicating higher intensity of urge.   
Multidisciplinary Evaluation: Evaluation by [CONTACT_700219] : A DBS fellowship -
trained neurosurgeon ([CONTACT_700273]) will perform a complete history and a physical examination, evaluate medical co -morbidities, obtain or examine a recent 
brain MRI scan, and clinically assess all medical co -morbidities and potential risks of 
TS surgery.  
Evaluation by [CONTACT_700220] : All potential participants will undergo a 
neuropsychological evaluation in order to screen for potential attention, memory, and/or other cognitive deficits that might potentially interfere with their participation in this protocol. The specific measures will provide broad- based coverage of the 
major cognitive domains and include validated measures routinely given to our DBS patients (pre and post-surgery), as well as those recommended by [CONTACT_700221]201300850

9)   Surgical Procedure:  A high resolution, volumetric, three tesla MRI scan will be 
obtained prior to the surgical procedure. On the morning of the procedure, a Cosman-Roberts -Wells (CRW) head ring will be applied under local anesthesia and a high -
resolution stereotactic head Com puted Tomography (CT) scan will be obtained. 
Using software developed at UF, the CT and MRI images will be fused and stereotactic targeting will be carried out using the high quality MRI images. Only imaging procedures that adhere to the DBS manufacturer’s  guidelines will be used in 
this study. This software facilitates navigation in “AC -PC space” (a computationally 
reformatted MRI with a three -dimensional, orthogonal Cartesian coordinate system 
centered on the patient’s mid -commissural point), which is rea dily defined by 
[CONTACT_700224] a non- colinear midline point 
in the patient’s brain. The initial target and trajectory will be selected in AC -PC space 
and the corresponding CRW coordinates will be automatically genera ted and used to 
set the stereotactic frame. Detailed microelectrode recording will confirm the location of CM prior to implantation. 
CM Location:  The stereotactic target of CM will be defined anatomically utilizing 
lateral, antero -posterior, and midline points of reference. The anterior commissure, 
posterior commissure, and midline points will be defined on our computer software. 
The antero -posterior coordinate will be defined relative to the midcommissural point. 
The CM target will be stereotactically targ eted at 5 mm lateral, and 4 mm posterior to 
the midcommissural point. A trajectory will be chosen to avoid blood vessels and the base of sulci. A dime to nickel sized burr hole will be placed and a microelectrode recording apparatus set up on the head fram e. The CM thalamus will be located by 
[CONTACT_700225]+S  ERP Review  Considerations  Checklist,  version  
9/23/[ADDRESS_950539] ’s MRI and then the 
target located by [CONTACT_700226] (3 passes) on the morphed 
atlas. The physiological  recordings will be utilized to define [ADDRESS_950540] through the length of the nucleus (approximately 10 mm), and into ventral thalamus (approx imately 10 mm). 
Additionally, the ventral thalamic border will be delineated by [CONTACT_700227]. The study PI [INVESTIGATOR_700199] (over 900 DBS cases) and will determine the correct location and depth of the final lead. Th e subject 
will have position sensors placed on the extremities with motor tics. Recording of cells and position sensors will be synchronously obtained, along with a videotape to correlate tics. Once the pattern of physiological signal has been verified, th e final lead 
will be placed to cover both the dorsal and ventral extent of CM. Contacts 1 and 2 (of 0, 
1, 2, 3 ventral to dorsal configuration) will be placed in the center of the target. The lead will be tested by [CONTACT_161566] -stimulation to obtain thresholds for benefit and side 
effects. A fluoroscopic X -ray will then be obtained and the lead secured using the 
plastic cap provided in the DBS kit ( Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minn)  
After placement of each CM DBS lead, a cortical ECOG strip on each side will be 
placed through a second small burr hole to reach the desired pre -motor and motor 
cortical strip region.  A Medtronic Summit R C+S device which is a new 
neurostimulator that has the ability to acquire, process, and store neural activity from ECOG and deep brain LFP  leads will be placed subclavicularly within 30 days of lead 
implant (and tunneled and connected by a lead extension as is standard in DBS 
Medtronic CONFIDENTIAL  RC+S  ERP Review  Considerations  Checklist,  version  
9/23/2019  Page  29 of 64 
 operations). The lead configuration is connected directly to the battery source which 
will be placed in a subclavicul ar pocket and will consist of the following: lead 1 – left 
CM depth electrode, lead 2 – left cortical ECoG strip for pre -motor and primary 
motor, lead 3 – right CM depth electrode, and lead 4 – right cortical ECoG strip for pre-motor and primary motor. Lead 1 and lead 2 will be connected via a Y -connector 
(Medtronic [ZIP_CODE]) provided by [CONTACT_700228] a single channel 8- contact 
[CONTACT_700229]+S only allows [ADDRESS_950541] leads. The same will be done to lead 3 and lead 4. There will be one  
neurostimulator (Summit RC+S) implanted within the  chest  connected to all four 
leads . 
The placement of the Medtronic Model [ZIP_CODE] cortical strip will target M1 at a point on M1 approximately 3 cm from the midline.  This targeting will be based on the 
anatomic identification of the central sulcus and by [CONTACT_700230] e.a.[ 72], we will use these authors’ published procedure to place and 
verify the ECOG lead [72]. Once the new burr hole is drilled, the dura matter will be 
opened and t he Medtronic Model [ZIP_CODE] cortical strip will be placed over pre -motor 
and motor hand/arm regions. The "hand bump" is an easily identifiable landmark on the stereotactic MRI.  We will also check the "phase reversal" on somato -sensory 
evoked potential which will assist in confirming the electrode position is over the M1 hand/arm area. A small notch will be placed on the burr hole to help hold the cortical strip in place, and the burr hole will be sealed with a fibrin sealant. P ost-implantation, 
subjects will be comprehensively evaluated for any untoward symptom and will receive the appropriate treatment as necessary. Subjects will continue to be evaluated 
Medtronic CONFIDENTIAL  RC+S  ERP Review  Considerations  Checklist,  version  
9/23/2019  Page  30 of 64 
 throughout the study for any significant health changes and referred accor dingly for 
clinical care as needed.  
10)   Description of the Hardware:  The system that will be used includes the 
neurostimulator itself; the implantable leads; a programmer that includes a wand and telemetry interface; a recharging coil and controller for recharging Summit RC+S 
neurostimulator; and a patient remote control to check battery status and whether the device is on or off . These devices are called the Recharge Therapy Manager (RTM, 
Model [ZIP_CODE]) and Patient Therapy Manager (PTM, Model 4NR009), respectively. The patients will receive training from the research group, and will be given written instructions to take home. The Clinician Telemetry Module (CTM, Model 4NR011)  
is used to set up the devic e  stimulation. The sensing parameters will be setup through 
the Summit RC+S Research Development Kits. The depth leads for CM have a 
flexible, isodiametric lead body that encloses four insulated wires, and have four cylindrical electrodes at the distal en d. The proximal end has four contacts adapted 
for connecting to the neurostimulator device (Medtronic lead models 3387). The depth lead is implanted into the brain to provide an interface through which stimulation can be delivered, or the activity of the brain can be monitored by [CONTACT_700231] a clinician using a programmer. The model 3387 DBS lead has four electrodes with 1.5mm contacts and 1.5mm spacing.  The RC+S stimulator is 
rated for 9 years and is rechargeable.  Patients will be required to charge as needed to maintain device functionality.   
The Medtronic Model [ZIP_CODE] cortical strip has a flexible, isodiametric lead body that encloses four insulated wires, and has four disk electrodes within a paddle at its distal 
Medtronic CONFIDENTIAL  RC+S  ERP Review  Considerations  Checklist,  version  
9/23/2019  Page  31 of 64 
 end. The proximal end has four contacts adapted for connecting to the 
neurostimulator device. The strip lead is implanted into the brain to provide an interface through which stimulation can be delivered or activity of the brain can be monitored by [CONTACT_8121], or observed by a clinician using a programmer.   
There will thus, in summary, be two CM thalamic leads (one in each brain hemisphere) and two ECOG strips (one in each brain hemisphere), and one neurostimulator  (Summit RC+S)  implanted in the chest.  
Subjects will have a post -operative CT scan for lead location and to assess for 
intracranial air and hemorrhage.  The CT scan will be fused back to the MRI.  Each of 
the four contacts on each deep DBS lead will be measured, and localized on an atlas to confirm the correct lead position. In the future if an experimental fMRI or MRI is 
considered, FDA and IRB approval will be sought.  The Summit system has not been 
evaluated for MR compatibility . 
11)   Specific Approaches for Specific Aim 1 Overview:   The study will follow a 
prospective blinded design (see Figure 1 below). Effectiveness, tolerability, and safety will be assessed, and the study will allow for exploration of appropriate programming parameters.  
12)   Study Summary:   Once subjects have been consented, baseline measures must 
be collected within two weeks of the surgery.  Subjects will be followed with standardized measures for a minimum of 24 months (+/ - 14 days) post -DBS 
implantation  and a maximum of 36 months (+/ - 14 days) post -DBS implantation  for 
the research study .  The main outcomes will be measured at [ADDRESS_950542] -DBS  (+/- 
Medtronic CONFIDENTIAL  RC+S  ERP Review  Considerations  Checklist,  version  
9/23/2019  Page  32 of 64 
 14 days) . There will then be three additional days of data collection where subjects will 
be either “on” DBS, “off DBS” or “on DBS responsive mode (Figure 1 and 2).”  
MRTRS scales will be collected in each mode for an independent video review.  Stimulators will be blindly set to the “mode” for the day and left in that mode for one hour prior to data collection which will include MRTS and also physiology as recorded by [CONTACT_700232].  
 
Figure 1.  Study design 
• Following recruitment and multidisciplinary screening, candidates will receive 
bilateral CM DBS plus bilateral ECOG strips, and bilateral chest implanted 
neurostimulators. 
• Prior to implantation, primary outcome and secondary outcome variables will 
be assessed. A blinded videotape will be obtained of the MRTRS. The blinded 
videotapes will be evaluated by [CONTACT_700233]’s at baselin e and 6 months (+/ - 14 days). 
• Implantation will be accomplished by a neurosurgeon and neurologist, both of 
whom will not participate in the blinded evaluations of subjects.  
• The primary effectiveness outcome for the study will be >40% reduction on 

Medtronic CONFIDENTIAL  RC+S  ERP Review  Considerations  Checklist,  version  
9/23/2019  Page  33 of 64 
 the blindly rated YGTSS total motor/phonic tic sub -scale at six months on 
DBS as compared to pre -op baseline. The secondary effectiveness variable 
will be assessed by [CONTACT_700234]. 
• The primary safety outcome will be defined as the serious adverse event  
(SAE) rate in patients compared to the SAE rate in patients implanted with the 
Medtronic DBS device for treatment of Parkinson’s disease as drawn from published randomized studies [13, 67- 71].  The intent is to show that the 
serious adverse event rate will not exceed the 95
th percent confidence interval 
for the historical experience with the Medtronic DBS for Parkinson’s disease. A 95% confidence interval for the SA E rate will be utilized for an analysis of 
data for 10 subjects at their three month visits due to the small sample size.  
• The secondary outcome measure will consist of a review of the types, duration 
and frequency of non- serious adverse events.  Therefore , all adverse events 
will be used as an additional measure in determining safety outcomes.  
• The safety experience will be reviewed approximately every [ADDRESS_950543] (DSMB). The DSMB will be informed of all 
serious adverse even ts and all mild adverse events which are potentially 
device related. The DSMB will designate each AE as mild or severe; as device 
related, uncertain to be device related or not device related; and as anticipated 
or unanticipated. The DSMB may employ a stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_700200] 1 
device related death or completed suicide.  
Details of the Protocol:  
• Following consent, subjects will be screened by [CONTACT_700235]+S  ERP Review  Considerations  Checklist,  version  
9/23/2019  Page  34 of 64 
 and ethics panel to be certain all inclusion and exclusion criteria are met.  
• Following approval by [CONTACT_700236], subjects will 
undergo baseline studies and within four weeks will receive bilateral CM 
devices and bilateral ECOG devices.  
• Stimulation will be turned on within one week  (+/- 7 days) after  the implant 
completion which will be approximately one month post lead implantation. 
• All subjects will undergo once a month programming visits for months 1- 6 
(+/- 14 days, with the exception of Month 1, which has a +/ - 7 day window) .  
Additional visits ma y be needed to obtain optimization of settings. 
Physiological data will be collected from both the CM thalamus and the ECOG strips during all protocol visits , and responsive parameters will also be 
tested.  Subjects may also choose to come to the clinic for “unscheduled 
visits” as they deem necessary.  The activities done at these visits will be at the discretion of the principal investigator.  
• Physiology data beyond month 12, and the chronic stimulation titration (visits 
6.1-6.4), may be performed at the participant’s home as necessary rather than 
at the University of [LOCATION_012].   The equipment used are all mobile  as shown in 
the RC+S system configuration as explained in Section 18 (refer to Figure 3) .  
• Details of physiology collection procedure: The subject will be asked to put on EMG sensors and signals from this device will stream into the research 
host computer (RHC). The signals from the Summit R C+S device will also be 
downloaded onto the  RHC, which will have the Summit Research 
Medtronic CONFIDENTIAL  RC+S  ERP Review  Considerations  Checklist,  version  
9/23/2019  Page  35 of 64 
 Development Kit (RDK) installed (refer to Section 1 9). Stimulation and brain 
activity data since the previous visit can then be reviewed and analyzed on an 
individual basis. 
• The CM neurostimulators will be programmed in an outpatient setting to 
deliver only chronic continuous stimulation in all patients. Stimulation 
parameters will be adjusted as necessary to provide maximal tic reduction.  The cortical  strips will be chronica lly set to record mode for data collection 
only, until the acute Aim 3 responsive trial.  
• The neurologist and DBS programmer will be allowed to adjust stimulation 
parameters during months 1- 5 to achieve maximal tic suppression and 
minimal to no side effects .  The programming that will be employed will be 
identical to that used for Parkinson’s disease randomized trials [13, 67- 71]. 
• At day 180 (6 months  +/- 14 days ), the primary and secondary outcome 
variables will collected, as will all scales .  If optimization is not achieved at 
Month 6, Month 6 data collection may be postponed as deemed necessary by 
[CONTACT_079] (with the exception of the C -SSRS) , up to 12 
months (+/ - 14 days) past the first programming visit (Month 1) .  However, 
there must be a 30 period of stable stimulation settings before primary outcomes are assessed.  
• Primary and secondary outcomes and physiology collection will be assessed 
over approximately 3 outpatient days. The “on” DBS condition will be used 
and compared to the pre -operative baseline for the primary outcome (specific 
aim 1). The other conditions will be used for secondary analyses, and the on

Algorithm for CM Thalamus Device Programming:  Programming to be performed 
for this study by [CONTACT_700237].  
Prior to programming sessions each month, there will be a one to two hour 
physiology data collection session (specific aim 2). Fifteen minutes of real time physiological baseline monitoring will be recorded from the device (this will be 
videotaped and moti on sensors will be applied to capture tics and correlate with 
physiology).  R esponsive settings will be checked each month and any improvement 
in tics noted. 
• Each of the four thalamic contacts on the DBS lead will be checked for 
benefits and side effects o f stimulation using the identical paradigm employed 
by [CONTACT_700238]’s disease 
DBS [73]. The initial programming paradigm is designed to help the clinician 
choose the best stimulation contact [CONTACT_700239]. 
• A baseline MRTRS will be recorded prior to each programming session. 
• Electrical impedances and battery life will be checked to ensure the integrity 
of the device. Any anomalies will require immediate referral to the implanting

• High frequency stimulation will be held constant at 130Hz, and pulse width 
held constant at 90 μs during the duration of the initial programming session.  
• Each lead contact (0, 1, 2, 3) will be independe ntly tested on each of the two 
CM leads. The voltage will be increased by .[ADDRESS_950545] lasting 
>[ADDRESS_950546] data during the different stimulation settings to 
investigate the induced changes in the brain signals that may provide signatures of optimal stimulation settings.  
• The benefits on visible tic suppression will be subjectively assessed at each 
contact [CONTACT_700240]; the contact [CONTACT_700241]. 
• A concluding MRTRS will be recorded at the conclusion of this initial 
programming session, following a 20 minute period at the chronically c hosen 
settings.  
• Each month the programmer will have the latitude to change the contact, frequency, or pulse width of stimulation liberally, and as often as needed until 
optimal settings are discovered for visible tic suppression.

 • There must be a 30 day pe riod where no changes are made to the final DBS 
parameters prior to the examination of the primary outcome measure.  
• All scales and a blinded videotape will be obtained of the MRTRS at 6 months 
in the on, off and at responsive stimulation settings will be performed.  
• The MRTRS videotapes will be scrambled by [CONTACT_700242] v ideotape review will not be biased.  
A summary of Month 6 data collection is provided below (Figure 2), note these 
conditions will be presented blindly to the patient, and then performed over 3 separate days of testing.  The order of the three conditions wi ll be set by [CONTACT_700243] 10 patients (figure 2 below):  
 
Figure 2.  Timeline of clinical scales for reporting study outcomes.  
Specific Approaches for Specific Aim 2: The information obtained in specific aim 1 during each data collection session will be sorted, and correlations between physiology and tics, urge to tic, or behavioral abnormality will be sought. The signal -
processing tools that will be utilized for this task will include established spectral analysis methods , namely:  
• Power changes in the time and frequency domains  

Medtronic CONFIDENTIAL  RC+S  ERP Review  Considerations  Checklist,  version  
9/23/2019  Page  39 of 64 
 • Changes in inter -channel coherence and/or cross -correlation  
• Fractal dimension and line length  
• Presence of phase amplitude coupling between gamma band activity and other 
oscillations  
The combination of these analysis techniques in multiple brain regions (cortical and 
thalamic) allows for detection of thala mocortical interaction. Endogenous modulation 
of thalamocortical rhythmicity occurs during specific cognitive processes, several of which (e.g. sens orimotor gating, and focused motor action) have been implicated in 
the pathophysiology of TS [57]. This analysis will be performed for two reasons. First, 
these analyses may yield triggers detectable by [CONTACT_700244] (i.e. spectral power estimation). This analysis will be performed for two reasons. First, these analyses may yield predictors detectable by [CONTACT_700245]: line length trending, area -under -the-curve 
trending, and half -wave detection, applied in various logical combinations on single 
or multip le channels. Second, using an a priori  limit on the multiple analysis methods 
will aid in assigning significance to any changes observed. This analysis will also allow us to conclude the total number of subjects in our cohort with gamma or other band oscil lations.  The analysis will allow us to examine whether there is an ECOG 
motor or pre -motor signal that can be used for responsive stimulation (detect in the 
ECOG and respond with DBS from the CM).  
Specific Approaches for  Aim 3 : If an electrophysiological change or set of changes 
from baseline can be observed to preferentially accompany motor tics, across a given subject’s data, with significance p < 0.1, it will be defined as a predictor  for that 
Medtronic CONFIDENTIAL  RC+S  ERP Review  Considerations  Checklist,  version  
9/23/[ADDRESS_950547]. Note that we do not require a high level of significance here; nor do we 
require the predictor to be entirely absent from baseline data. We assume that the consequences of a false positive (i.e., detection of the predictor without accompanying tics) are negligible. This is justified since the amount of stimulation that will be delivered responsively will in any case be less than that which would be delivered by [CONTACT_700246].  We will utilize available analysis tools to examine outcomes, but we will also report to the FDA on any new responsive stimulation detection and programming tools that may become available during the course of this protocol, and request permission to use them if appropriate. 
Subjects for whom predictors can be identified during acute ph ysiological data 
collections in Months 1-5, as described above, will have a responsive DBS setting 
programmed for their six -month outcome testing. In responsive mode , the device may 
titrate the amplitude of stimulation within previously set comfort and saf ety levels, if 
tic signatures are not suppressed (i.e., until non- symptomatic brain signals are 
attained ). If patients respond favorably during acute responsive testing, we will test 
chronic responsive stimulation for one month at a time  (+/- 14 days), at some time 
point approved by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_700196] 6 and Month 36 (see visits 6.1-6.4 in schedule of events). The stimulation amplitude will be set to its optimal setting for chronic stimulation. The new patient programmer will allow patients to turn off responsive stimulation and switch back to standard continuous therapy.  Subjects without a predictor will not have a chronic responsive setting. 
Options for the Subject Once Specific Aims are Complete: Subjects may at any 
time during th e study opt to terminate their participation and may also opt for 
Medtronic CONFIDENTIAL  RC+S  ERP Review  Considerations  Checklist,  version  
9/23/[ADDRESS_950548] stimulation 
settings based on patient tolerance, and both short-term and long- term response. A s 
long as the R C+ S batteries are implanted, all subjects implanted will have the option 
for chronic or responsive stimulation depending on their individual preference and effectiveness of each technique.  For subjects not under optimal control following [ADDRESS_950549] Medtronic devi ce after the study period once the R C+S is depleted.  
However, only the RC+S allow closed loop stimulation. As long as the subject is implanted with the RC+S device , the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_700201] (labeled to last  9 years).  These annual visits will be treated and billed as routine 
DBS checks.   We will discuss with the subject the option of explanting their devices 
and pursuing insurance authorization to implant a standard Medtronic DBS device in CM for control of tic as needed . 
13)   Description of Power Analysis and Statistical Methods :   
Power Analysis : We will determine the effectiveness of DBS by [CONTACT_700247] (YGTSS) at the six month time point to the pre- operative value for each 
subject. A 40% or greater reduction will be considered a successful response. The power to detect a statistical significance between a null proportion of 0.10 (this assumes that the true proportion of successful responders is 10%). The power analysis revealed that for an alternative proportion of .60 (i.e., 6 of 10 patients will show a 
Medtronic CONFIDENTIAL  RC+S  ERP Review  Considerations  Checklist,  version  
9/23/2019  Page  42 of 64 
 40% or greater reduction in motor tics at six months) there is a statistical power of 
0.80 at an alpha level of .05. Ther efore, we anticipate ten participants will be required 
for this study. The power  procedure in Statistical Analysis Software (SAS), version 
9.[ADDRESS_950550] the power analysis. Data collected from this study will provide additional and currently unavailable data to inform power analysis of subsequent studies  in Table 2 below.   
Medtronic CONFIDENTIAL  RC+S  ERP Review  Considerations  Checklist,  version  
9/23/2019  Page  43 of 64 
 Table 2 . Power Analysis for Sample Size Effects  
 
General Analysis Approaches : The Wilcoxon signed rank test will be used to test for 
significant pre -post changes in numerical measures (e.g., YGTSS). Spearman 
correlations will be used to test re lationships among numerical measures (e.g., 
neurocognitive measures, severity of tics and quality of life measures). Both the 
Wilcoxon signed rank and Spearman correlation tests are nonpa rametric procedures 
that are robust from data departures from normality and appropriate in the case of small sample sizes. All statistical tests will be two -sided and will be considered 
significant if p -values are less than 0.05. SAS software will be used to conduct all 
data analysis.  
Specific Analysis Approach for Aim 1 : 
 We will determine the effectiveness of the 
“on condition” of DBS by [CONTACT_700248] (YGTSS) at the six month evaluation to the pre-operative value for each subject. A 40% or grea ter reduction will 
be considered a successful response. We will then test the hypothesis that the proportion of successful responders is greater or equal to (6/10) using the exact 

Medtronic CONFIDENTIAL  RC+S  ERP Review  Considerations  Checklist,  version  
9/23/[ADDRESS_950551]. We will compare the baseline motor YGTSS to the on DBS condition 
at six months (primary outcome). We will also perform comparisons of baseline to  
on/off/responsive conditions, and also comparisons of on/off conditions at six months as secondary analyses. To compare on versus off condition, we will form paired difference scores of YGTSS (YGTSS on minus YGTSS off) at six months and test for significance using the Wilcoxon signed rank test.  
Specific Analysis Approach for Aim 2 : We will first investigate rate and pattern 
changes in physiology and the possible correlation with clinical manifestation of motor tics by [CONTACT_700249]. These exploratory techniques will include spectrograms and event related 
potentials. We will then conduct a preliminary time series analysis estimating fractal dimension, line length, and area-under-the- curve of the raw signal. The data obtained 
from these analyses will inform subsequent analysis and guide the development of statistical methods to analyze these types of data streams. Subsequent analysis will be more comprehensive, and will include time -frequency analysis of specific frequency 
bands, measures of coherence between channels containing movement related activity, and quantification of phase -amplitude coupling between frequency bands of interest. 
Any of these techniques has the potential to identify candidate predictors of tic onset.  
Specific Analysis Approach for Aim 3 : 
 This protocol calls for testing an acute 
responsive DBS condition in subjects who reveal physiological pre dictors that can be 
set to sense tic by [CONTACT_1345], and to respond to tic on the CM implanted device. It may also be possible to both sense and deliver stimulation from the CM DBS lead.  Data will be analyzed using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. We will collect physiology 
Medtronic CONFIDENTIAL  RC+S  ERP Review  Considerations  Checklist,  version  
9/23/[ADDRESS_950552]  chronic responsive stimulation settings one 
month at a time for those subjects that respond well to the acute testion after 
Month 3 .   
Risk Analysis: The Medtronic Activa R C+S device and Medtronic Model [ADDRESS_950553] be 
considered based on information from the literature of deep brain stimulation . This 
experience suggests that deep brain stimulation has  an acceptable risk profile and that 
anticipated benefits outweigh the probable risks. Kimmelman and colleagues in a 
recent meta- analysis of deep brain surgery for Parkinson’s disease revealed a 
favorable risk -benefit ratio with the estimated intracerebral hemorrhage rate of 1.57% 
(95% confidence interval, 1.26% -1.95%), and the proportion of trajectories associated 
with serious neurological deficits was only 0.41% (0.28% -0.60%) [74]. 
14) Saf ety Studies and Potential Risks with the Inve stigational Device:  
Experience with the Medtronic R C+S device and Cortical Strips :  
There are currently no human patients implanted with the Medtronic Activa R C+S 
along with the  Medtronic Model [ZIP_CODE] cortical strip  for TS.  
Safety of Chronically Implanted Neurostimulators:  Probable risks associated with 
chronically implanted neurostimulators and of devices implanted in the cranium 
include the risks of surgery -related adverse events such as hemorrhage and infection, 
chronic implantation adverse events such as infection, eros ion and necrosis, 
stimulation -related side effects or discomfort, and stimulation associated brain injury. 
Experience from randomized DBS studies for Parkinson’s disease suggest a low 
Medtronic CONFIDENTIAL  RC+S  ERP Review  Considerations  Checklist,  version  
9/23/2019  Page  46 of 64 
 overall risk [13, 67- 71].  Additionally, a recent expert consensus led by [CONTACT_700250]. reviewed DBS co mplications [75].  The rates of surgical complications depende d 
on the team and experience and included intracranial hemorrhage, stroke, infection, 
lead erosion without infection, lead fracture, lead migration, and death.  These were all rare complications and the most worrisome overall complication was the possibili ty of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage which was less than 2% at 
experienced medical centers. Hardware infection was the most commonly reported serious adverse effect and ranged from approximately 5% to 20% among reports in the literature [75]. 
Safety Experience with Medtronic Summit R C+S device and Cortical Strips  in 
TS 
There are no human cases published of the use of this device in TS DBS.  
Perception of Neurostimulation: Stimulation of the brain has the potential to produce sensations that are noxious or disturbing.  Any stimulation related side effects can be alleviated by [INVESTIGATOR_1312]- programming or turning the device to an off position, 
which we plan to do during this study.  
Other Medtronic Summit  RC+S and Cortical Strip  System Potential Risks:  
The following adverse events have been reported with deep brain stimulation: 
dysaesthesias , speech disorders, headache, abnormal thinking, abnormal vision, 
double vision, abnormal dreams, difficulty swallowing, paresis/paralysis, pneumonia, 
CNS depression, hostility, personality disorder, confusion, paresthesia, anxiety, chest pain, hallucinati on, drowsiness, amnesia, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, walking 
difficulty, postural hypotension, increased salivation, agitation, delusions, difficult 
Medtronic CONFIDENTIAL  RC+S  ERP Review  Considerations  Checklist,  version  
9/23/2019  Page  47 of 64 
 breathing, fainting, sleep disorder, rapid heart rate and deep thrombophlebitis [74, 76-
78].  
If the patient is not satisfied with the programming stimulation options at home  and 
would like them to be revised outside of the standard clinical study visits, 
reprogramming can only be performed at UF . This is because  standard Medtronic 
stimulation programmers that can interface with stand ard Medtronic 
neurostimulators , which can be found at other institutions , do not interface with the 
Summit RC+S.  
Summary of the Most Serious Medtronic Summit  RC+S and Cortical Strip  
Risks:  
There are no human cases published on this device in TS DBS and therefore there is 
no summary data available except what can be referenced in the Device Masterfile #2010. 
Some medical procedures such as diathermy, electroconvulsive therapy, and transcranial magnetic stimulation are prohibited because the amount of ener gy 
coupled into the implanted lead system can result in heating and neural tissue damage. Any medical procedure that delivers energy to an implanted lead system has the potential to cause tissue damage by [CONTACT_700251]. Therapeutic radiation to the head should be avoided due to potential damage to the Medtronic Summit R C+S and 
Medtronic Model [ZIP_CODE] cortical strip s ystem. This is included in the labeling 
appendix which we include in this IDE.  
Treatment with therapeutic ultrasound to the head and neck shoul d not be performed 
since energy may be sent thorough the leads resulting in brain damage. The effects of 
Medtronic CONFIDENTIAL  RC+S  ERP Review  Considerations  Checklist,  version  
9/23/2019  Page  48 of 64 
 therapeutic ultrasound treatment below the head and neck on the System are unknown 
and should be avoided unless the risk of not using the treatment out weigh the risks of 
using it.  However, imaging with diagnostic ultrasound to any part of the body is safe 
and will not interfere with the System.  
Magnetic Resonance Imaging: The Summit system has not been evaluated for MRI safety .  Therefore, subjects will  be asked to carefully consider whether they 
anticipate future MRI scans.  This is a risk -benefit trade- off that will be 
discussed prior to study participation.  If necessary, a CT scan will follow device implantation.   Images of the brain produced using ultrasound or magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI), may be compromised by a cranially implanted medical device. In addition, there are risks associated with neuroimaging that require following safety guidelines; failure to do so may result in serious injury to  the patient.  
The high magnetic field associated with MR imaging may cause induced currents 
and/or mechanical forces on the pulse generator and/or lead(s); these may be perceived by [CONTACT_700252] a pulse generator and/or the lead(s). In addition, the radio frequency (RF) fields used in MR imaging may 
cause induced currents and heating of the pulse generator and/or lead(s); these may cause damage to the surrounding tissue.  
MR imaging of patients implanted with a neurostimula tor device may be safe under 
certain conditions (see labeling appendix), however failure to follow MR safety guidelines may result in injury. While the number of incidences has been low, there have been two reported cases of severe injury resulting from MR  imaging of patients 
implanted with deep brain stimulators. In one case, a patient who was implanted 
Medtronic CONFIDENTIAL  RC+S  ERP Review  Considerations  Checklist,  version  
9/23/[ADDRESS_950554] caused thermal tissue damage. In the second case, a patient with bilaterally implanted neurostimulation systems developed a neurologic deficit following an MR procedure. In both incidences the scans were performed using parameters that deviated from the manufacturer recommended safety guidelines [79, 
80]. 
System Replacements, Lead Connection Changes, and Explants  
Battery Depletion : In the event of battery depletion (whether due to a pre -mature 
failure or following the labeled 9 year lifetime), an additional surgical procedure will 
be required to replace the Neurostimulator, assuming that the System functionality is still desired.  
The risks posed by a Neurostimulator replacement or explant procedure are expected 
to be lower than those of the initial implant. During a replacement procedure, there is 
no need to create a new craniectomy, resulting in a much shorter procedure time. The previously implanted leads are attached to the new neurostimulator s or are 
abandoned. Therefore, neurostimulator replacement s does not require penetration of 
the dura.  
When the RC+S battery is depleted, the patients will be given the option of replacement or explantation. For the former, the deplete d device,  will be replaced by 
[CONTACT_700253]+S (with 4 electrode array inputs) or one commercially available RC device (with 2 electrode array inputs). In the la tter case, the cortical leads will  be left 
in place, disconnected proximally, with the thin proximal end of the extension 
Medtronic CONFIDENTIAL  RC+S  ERP Review  Considerations  Checklist,  version  
9/23/2019  Page  50 of 64 
 exposed and buried deep to the IPG. This will avoid the risk of inadvertent delivery of 
unintended cortical stimulation as a potential programming error. Only continuous (conventional) DBS can be delivered from the RC devices. If the  study doctor 
determines it is necessary to remove the device, or if the patients  request that the 
device be removed, the cost of removal will be billed to t he insurance company. The 
patients will be responsible for paying any deductible, co- insurance, or co -payments 
for these explant services, and for any non -covered or out -of-network services.  
Patients will be informed that DBS electrode removal involves substantial risk of reversible and irreversible harms, such as requiring additional brain interventions, further hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], long -term use of antibiotics or other medications, possible 
loss of the benefits of future stimulation and psychological distres s.  
 
Summary of Risks to Subjects:  Though there is no safety data in humans specific to 
the devices used in this study, the safety experience of DBS systems in the literature has been reassuring [75]. Significant adverse events associ ated with implantation of 
the neurostimulator and leads, such as hemorrhage, CNS infection and poor wound healing can occur w ith DBS. Subjects have tolerated DBS devices well, both in terms 
of comfort with the cranial implant as well as with stimulation. And the common side effects encountered that are unique to TS CM DBS have been a subjective sensation of eye pulling/twitching, sensory phenomenon, nausea, and dizziness.  All of these common side effects with CM DBS are reversible by [CONTACT_700254] . [37, 38, 59, 75, 76, 78, 81 -83].  
Procedures for Protecting Against or Minimizing Risks:   We plan to follow the 
Medtronic CONFIDENTIAL  RC+S  ERP Review  Considerations  Checklist,  version  
9/23/2019  Page  51 of 64 
 Tourette Syndrome Association’s recommendations and only enroll adults with TS 
whose tics are severe and in tractable to medical therapy [44]. Our investigation will 
use rigorous inclusion and exclusion criteria, pre-  and post -operative assessments 
using standardized rating scales and comprehensive post -operative assessments 
including neurological, psychiatric, and neuropsychological evaluations. Study subjects will be assessed by a psychiatrist  or neurologist using the C -SSRS at each 
study visit to monitor for suicidal ideation and/or intent. In addition, the UF Movement Disorders Center has expertise in diagnosing and treating TS in a multidisciplinary manner.  
Effective screening and the neurol ogical/psychiatric evaluation will rule out other 
conditions that may prevent subjects from participating in these studies. Once the subject enters the study, s/he will be closely followed by [CONTACT_252128]. Careful monitoring of all  subjects via phone contacts and clinical 
management throughout the study will help minimize risk. The clinical research team has developed considerable expertise in monitoring the safety of subjects participating in research studies. There is an experienced research neurologist/psychiatrist available [ADDRESS_950555] neurostimulator and used to turn the device off.  
The protocol includes exit criteria for those who believe their condition is worsening during any particular phase of the study, and participants can withdraw at any time. Subjects may also wish to discontinue stimulation for any reason and we will support 
Medtronic CONFIDENTIAL  RC+S  ERP Review  Considerations  Checklist,  version  
9/23/[ADDRESS_950556] 
should continue in their current study phase.  
If determined by [CONTACT_87690]/or the subject that it is in their best medical interest to have the device removed, it will be done expeditiously. In the event a 
problem develops after one month post -surgery, the neurostimulator can be removed 
leaving the leads in place. In the past, subjects that have the leads left in place have 
not experienced adverse advents except for the restriction on future MRI scans. This restriction may affect the participants’ ability to thoroughly evaluate other conditions 
should they develop in the future. The procedure would not restrict the participant from future neurosurgical procedures.  
Risks to privacy are negligible in this protocol , since subjects will not be identified by 
[CONTACT_700255]. Anticipated Benefits:  The primary anticipated benefit to subjects receiving an 
implanted Medtronic Summit R C+S and Medtronic Model [ADDRESS_950557] that deep brain stimulation can benefit 
Medtronic CONFIDENTIAL  RC+S  ERP Review  Considerations  Checklist,  version  
9/23/2019  Page  53 of 64 
 patients by [CONTACT_700256] -related adverse 
events [11, 26, 37, 84] .  The subjects will also have the benefit of the RC+S’s 9- year 
rated battery life, resulting in the likelihood of fewer battery replacement surgeries, 
thereby [CONTACT_700257].  The RC+S is the only rechargeable system with closed loop capability.  
15)   Justification for the Investigation :  This study will provide important safety, 
targeting, and effectiveness data for the treatment of medication refractory TS. The device and methodology are novel, and this study can provide potentially important experience for expanding stimulation options beyond standard chronic high frequency 
DBS. The study allows for “tailoring” of therapy to individual patient needs in a 
disorder that is known for its paroxysmal nature. Low duty cycle stimulation, particularly responsive stimulation, may have therapeutic advantages beyond what is currently available and this may allow further expansion to treatment of other 
neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. This device may have added benefits in saving battery life, and preventing tolerance. Finally, this study will offer physiological data from deep brain thalamic  structures in the human. Such 
information is conspi[INVESTIGATOR_700202], and has the potential to corroborate current models of TS pathophysiology. Furthermore, physiology may enhanc e our basic understanding of the circuitry involved in this disorder and help us 
to develop better, more focused hypothesis driven studies. 
16)   Patient Population, including number, age, sex and condition:  A total of ten 
subjects, [ADDRESS_950558] an active diagnosis of 
DSM -V major depression or other active and disabling psychiatric disorders. There 
Medtronic CONFIDENTIAL  RC+S  ERP Review  Considerations  Checklist,  version  
9/23/2019  Page  54 of 64 
 are no restrictions on ethnicity, social background, or gender. Only subjects who are 
able to give full informed consent would be accepted. Subjects who currently meet DSM -V criteria for: Bipolar or Psychotic Depression, Organic Mental Disorder, 
Schizophrenia, Schizoaffective Disorder, Delusional Disorder, or Psychotic Disorder Not Otherwise Specified will be excluded from t his study.  
17)   Monitoring Procedures:   This project entails substantial risk to subjects. 
Therefore, we have established the following monitoring procedures.  
Multidisciplinary Pre -Operative Screening and Evaluation:  The multidisciplinary 
pre-operative screening and evaluation will include four specialties: 1) movement 
disorders neurology, 2) psychiatry, 3) neurosurgery, and 4) neuropsychology.  
Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB): This study will have a designated DS MB 
composed of three members (A neurologist, a psychiatrist, and a non- neurological 
physician) without ties to the current study or any conflicts of interest. The DSMB will be charged with the duty of meeting every 6 months to discuss all of the AE’s for the study.  
The safety experience will be frequently reviewed by [CONTACT_16627] (DSMB). The DSMB will be informed of all serious adverse events and all mild adverse events which are potentially device related in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_98236]. The DSMB will designate each AE as mild or severe; as device related, 
uncertain to be device related or not device related; and as anticipated or unanticipated.  
Once the first subject is enrolled, the DSMB will meet approximately every [ADDRESS_950559] completed the 6 
Medtronic CONFIDENTIAL  RC+S  ERP Review  Considerations  Checklist,  version  
9/23/[ADDRESS_950560] would be a 
suicide attempt deemed potentially device related.  
Adverse Event Reporting:  Once a subject is enrolled  into the study, continuous 
close monitoring will be conducted by [CONTACT_079] (PI) in conjunction with the neurosurgeon and other investigators as well as the University of [LOCATION_012]’s Institutional Review Board (IRB), through annual reports of progress and by 
[CONTACT_700258] [INVESTIGATOR_492936].  
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_700203]: This study will be suspended by [CONTACT_700259][INVESTIGATOR_700204]. Specific examples that would warrant suspending the study include the following, only in the event that they do not reverse with adjustment or discontinuation of the DBS device:  
• Severe worsening of symptoms  
• Induction of severe difficult to treat depression  
 
Additionally, the DSMB has a firm stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_700205] a single death or 
suicide attempt in the cohort during the [ADDRESS_950561] -operative period.  
18) Device Description Summary: The Summit RC+S system is a 
multiprogrammable device that both delivers electrical stimulation and records 
Medtronic CONFIDENTIAL  RC+S  ERP Review  Considerations  Checklist,  version  
9/23/2019  Page  56 of 64 
 bioelectric data through one or two leads implanted in the brain. Summit RC+S  
electrical stimulation is based on the RC neurostimulator but adds the functionality of 
bioelectrical data recording (sensing). There are no new tissue contact[CONTACT_700260]+S.  
Stimulation is provided by [CONTACT_329349] a battery in an implantable neurostimulator ( INS) to metal electrodes surgically implanted in the 
brain in the same manner as previous Activa R C. The INS is typi[INVESTIGATOR_700206]. Current is conducted to the electrodes via electrical conduits, including extensions and leads, which are tunneled subdermally through the neck, 
travel through the skull, and terminate in a neural structure appropriate to the 
neurological disease being treated.  
Like Activa R C, the Summit R C+S system is capable of providing stimulation to 2 
leads, each with 4 electrode contacts. Stimulation parameters are adjusted to optimize therapy for the patient. They can be independently controlled and include the following: active electrode(s), electrode polarity, pulse width, amplitude, and frequency. The stimulat ion settings are stored in programs. A program is a specific 
combination of pulse width, rate, and amplitude settings acting on a specific electrode combination on a lead, or on a lead and the INS, in unipolar mode. Up to four programs can be combined into a group.  
Pulse width, amplitude, and electrode polarity are independently programmed for each program within a group. Rate, rate limits and cycling for each program within a group must have the same values.  
Stimulation is delivered to a maximum of two imp lanted leads (one lead per 
Medtronic CONFIDENTIAL  RC+S  ERP Review  Considerations  Checklist,  version  
9/23/2019  Page  57 of 64 
 hemisphere), with a maximum of 4 electrodes per lead. Rate is limited to 250 Hz, 
pulse width is limited to 450 μsec, amplitude is limited to 10.5 V (or 25.5 mA) and 
the charge density warning threshold is 30 μC/cm2/phase.   The RC+S is a 
rechargeable device.  Patients must charge the  device as often as needed to maintain 
its functionality.  This could be as often as daily.  Failure to properly recharge the 
stimulator will result in loss of stimulation . The patients will rec eive training from the 
research group  on how to recharge the device , and will be given written instructions 
to take home. They can reach out to the research team whenever they encounter any issues.   
Stimulation programs are controlled by [CONTACT_700261].. Sensing functions, the recording of bioelectric data, is controlled by a separate 
sensing clinician programmer.

BRAIN Initiative Public -Private Partnership with institutional and FDA 
investigational device exemptions.

RC+S communicates with peripheral devices via the Clinician Therapy Module 
(CTM), which must be within 2 meters of RC+S during communications. For clinical programming of the device, the research lab programmer (RLP) is linked to RC+S via the CTM. Most research related uses of RC+S are programmed on an investigator’s windows -based host computer using the Research Development Kit (RDK).  The 
RDK is an applicat ion programming interface (API) that can be programmed to 
establish a data and command conduit between a host computer and RC+S. This conduit can be utilized by [CONTACT_700262] -
latency stimulation update commands back to the neurostimulator, via the CTM. The patient recharges the device using the Rechargeable Therapy Monitor (RTM), and can interrogate it to check its function using the Patient Therapy Manager (PTM).  The 
patients will receive training from the research g roup on how to use these devices, 
and will be given written instructions to take home. They can reach out to the study group whenever they encounter issues.  
 
The RDK is designed for rapid, automated closed- loop algorithm prototypi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. This 

Medtronic CONFIDENTIAL  RC+S  ERP Review  Considerations  Checklist,  version  
9/23/[ADDRESS_950562] computer to enable a variety of softwar e programs (e.g., Java programs, Matlab® scripts, and graphical Matlab 
Simulink® models) to communicate with RC+S. This architecture allows algorithms to be both flexible and safe: flexibility is enabled because algorithms on the host computer can be as co mplex as needed and also utilize data from sensors connected to 
the external computer (e.g, wearable accelerometers, gait and posture sensors, etc.); safety is ensured because updates to the implantable stimulator are limited to those permissible by [CONTACT_700263] a 
clinician. With Summit RC+S demo units and the Summit RDK, we will first design toolboxes for the algorithms we currently use in our projects with the Activa PC+S. Since we have data collected wit h 6 TS patients, we will utilize these datasets and 
input them into the  Summit RDK as if they are being received from the RC+S 
implant. This rich dataset will allow us to learn how to program the SDK for real- time 
analysis. Since the RC+S allows for data s treaming of brain signals in real time 
without any signal degradation, next steps would be to implement more sophisticated machine learning and data mining algorithms on our computers. More importantly, we can connect a demo unit RC+S to external signal generators to program sensing algorithms and understand the ADC conversion processes within the RC+S. Finally, we can also connect the RC+S to oscilloscopes to study the stimulator outputs and stimulator output timings.

Prior to the Medtronic PC+S and R C+S devices  there was only one FDA -approved, totally 
implantable neuromodulation device that has the capability of sensing brain activity and 
delivering therapeutic stimulation: The Responsive Neurostimulation (RNS) device from 
Neuropace Inc. RNS is FDA -approved for the treatment of epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]. It has the capability to 
deliver short stimulation trains in the presence of epi[INVESTIGATOR_700207] 
a few pulse trains a day (5 minutes of stimulation a day). The very short battery life of this device precludes the delivery of constant or near -constant stimulation, as is the contemporary 
standard for movement disorders. A second platform, from Medtronic Inc . that allows 
adaptive stimulation paradigms was also recently introduced. The first-generati on device, the 
Activa PC+S, has been available under physician -sponsored investigational device 
exemptions since [ADDRESS_950563] begun to utilize this device in a variety of bra in disorders, for 
sensing subcortical LFPs or cortical ECoG potentials to advance understanding of disease pathophysiology. Our team at UF has extensive experience with PC+S in the context of our current study focusing on multi -site brain recordings during  Tourette deep brain stimulation. 
Recently, several add -ons to the basic PC+S platform were developed to prototype promising 
adaptive control algorithms. Although we and others have learned much from this experience, some problems with the first -generation  PC+S platform have limited full testing 
of adaptive control. Its signal -to-noise ratio may preclude detection of high frequency (>100 
Hz) cortical activity, fully internalized adaptive control strategies are limited, and its lack of recharging capability has raised concern for battery drainage when testing adaptive algorithms. Additionally, since Medtronic is phasing out the PC+S there is a risk that their device supply will not be able to support the remaining implants in our IDE protocol and

 therefore we will very likely need to switch to Summit RC+S eventually ; this second -
generation bidirectional (sense and stimulate) interface has a rechargeable battery, and an 
improved signal to noise ratio allowing detection of high frequency brain signals. It also h as 
a greater flexibility in the implementation of adaptive algorithms. The RC+S can be considered an “upgrade” to the PC+S, as it still provides closed loop stimulation, but also is rechargeable, providing a much longer battery life ( labeled as 9 years vs. approx. 2- 3 years).  
 
Adaptive stimulation with RC+S can occur in one of two modes: Distributed, in which the 
control algorithm resides on the researcher  host  computer  (RHC) , or embedded, in which 
control is accomplished within RC+S according to a preprogr ammed algorithm.  For in -clinic 
testing we will primarily use the distributed mode. During in clinic testing, ECoG and Cm -Pf 
LFP data will be streamed to the RHC  to verify that neural correlates of tics can be detected .  
These detected events will then be used to responsively deliver DBS. We will also study 
markers of clinically optimized settings, by [CONTACT_700264].  
An adaptive control algorithm is embedded in RC+S. Prior to home use of adaptive 
stimulation, patients will be given and instructed on how to use the Clinician Therapy Module (CTM) and a tablet computer provided by [CONTACT_700265]+S. Th ese devices allow switching off 
adaptive DBS and returning to open loop DBS.  
Adaptive control algorithms:  We will develop adaptive control algorithms using the 
Medtronic Research Development Kit. Since control algorithms will be based on each subjects’ pe rsonalized neural signatures of tic symptomology , we cannot specify exact 
Medtronic CONFIDENTIAL  RC+S  ERP Review  Considerations  Checklist,  version  
9/23/2019  Page  62 of 64 
 algorithms prior to  obtaining recordings from RC+S. In general, we expect the controller to 
utilize spectral power from one or more frequency bands extracted from cortical and/or  
thalamic  recordings.  Our initial data points to significant deviations from baseline data 
during tics in the Cm -Pf that is not present during voluntary movements (see Figure 4). These 
features can be captured using power bands of low frequencies up to 8Hz.

 observed during volitional movements, such as graspi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (shown), but (C,G) motor cortex beta 
desychronization is still observed. (I) Data from follow up visit month 2. Subject TS01 was 
instructed to tic freely. Tic onset denoted by [CONTACT_700266]:  (1) A neck wrenching tic (simple), 
(2)  Rapid arm throwing tic (complex long), (3)  Arm wrenching tic (complex), (4) Arm throwing 
and neck twisting tic (complex long). In a separate trial the subject was asked to perform a series 
of volitional movements. Movement onset denoted by [CONTACT_700266]: (5) Talking and 
opening/closing hands rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375], (6,7)  Opening/closing hands, (8,9)  Rapi[INVESTIGATOR_700208]. No tics 
were observed during the volitional movement condition. 
 
The controller will be based on threshold crossings in this  frequency range or possibly 
multiple frequency ranges , and will change stimulation current between a low -therapeutic 
level and a high -therapeutic level. For each proposed control algorithm, we will test the 
performance of the algorithm using an external RC+S and the RDK prior to implementing 
adaptive control  in the patient. System integration will be checked by [CONTACT_700267]+S unit to signal generators to verify sensing algorithms, and by [CONTACT_700267]+S unit to oscilloscopes to verify stimulation delivery is consistent with algorithm outputs using previously collected neural data from PC+S devices. Testing and documentation of system integration for sensing and stimulation will comply with FDA CFR 820.30 on design controls for implanted devices. 
 
Safety of adaptive stimulation : During adaptive stimulation, several safety features protect 
patients from the potential from uncomfortably high stimulation settings or from prolonged periods with clinically inadequate settings. Stimulation parameters that can be implemented by [CONTACT_700268] -induced adverse effects.  No possible combination of stimulation stetting 
will exceed the upper charge density limit of 30 microcoulombs per centimeter squa red per

 phase. Prior to home testing, patients will be instructed on how to exit adaptive mode at any 
time and return to open- loop mode should excessive discomfort occur, but are encouraged to 
consult with study staff if possible prior to doing so. 
 
Summit  RC+S sensing malfunction or premature battery drainage : Should the sensing 
capability of Summit RC+S fail, without failure of the therapeutic stimulation function, we will attempt to restore it by [CONTACT_700269] (see design master  file for 
Summit RC+S referenced in this application). Should the sensing function be permanently lost with no compromise of the therapeutic function, no specific treatment is needed, and the patient would exit from the study.  Regarding the possibility of  premature depletion of 
battery life due to use of the sensing function in addition to the neurostimulation function, this risk is mitigated by [CONTACT_700270] (compared to therapeutic stimulation). With in its lifetime labeled for 9 years, RC+S has no 
known limit to the number of times it can be recharged.

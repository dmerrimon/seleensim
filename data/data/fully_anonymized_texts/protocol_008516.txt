Gabapentin for Perioperative Pain Relief in Surgical Abortion 
Date: 5/1/[ADDRESS_665758] 
(#734274). We used a double-blind placebo controlled trial of gabapentin in the setting of an 
ambulatory surgical abortion center where patients received routine intravenous sedation (IVS) 
consisting of midazolam 4mg, fentanyl 100mcg, and local para-cervical 1% lidocaine block anesthesia 
(PCB) plus either 600 mg of gabapentin or placebo 1-2 hours prior to surgery. Patients scheduled to 
undergo surgical abortion between 5 and 23 6/7 weeks by [CONTACT_513730] (UGA) were 
approached during the preoperative counseling and offered participation. Patients included were [ADDRESS_665759] and the informed consent was reviewed with all 
eligible participants. Once consent was obtained and signed, the participants received the randomized 
pre-medication. Treatment bottles had been sequentially numbered so that par ticipants received the 
next available bottle in the sequence as they were recruited. Participants took the medication in front of 
the research staff. Baseline information was collected including age, marital and household status, 
race/ethnic group, gravidity, parity, LMP, gestational age, BMI, past medical and surgical history, 
medications, recreational drug use, prior abortions, and menstrual pain. 
A master list for the randomized treatments was generated by [CONTACT_513731]. Unblinding was only available to the investigators after participants had completed 
treatment (more than 24 hrs).  
Patients received Misoprostol 400 mcg buccal 90 minutes prior to surgery who were more than 12 
weeks by [CONTACT_2207] (UGA). Those patients more than 17 weeks by [CONTACT_513732] 1 day 
prior to surgery and patients at 20 to 23 6/7 weeks by [CONTACT_513733] 2 days as well as 
digoxin 1mg intrafetal injection 2 days prior to surgery. All procedures were performed by [CONTACT_513734].  
Patient questionnaires using 100mm visual analog scales (VAS) were used by [CONTACT_513735] 5 and 30 minutes after the procedure was completed as defined by [CONTACT_513736]. We 
determined that our primary outcome measure was the pain score at 5 minutes as measured by [CONTACT_513737]. Secondary measures included pain at 30 minutes and 24 hrs following surgery, nausea and 
vomiting pre and postoperatively, pre-procedure pain, and anxiety using the VAS scales. Postoperatively 
patients received oxycodone 7.5 mg (quantity 10) for pain control at home. The [ADDRESS_665760] a 20- 25-point VAS score difference between the 
treatment and placebo groups as we determined that this would be clinically relevant based on other 
pain studies. This calculation yielded a need for approximately 100 patients in each arm based on 80% 
power and a type one error of 0.05.   
Statistical Procedures and Data Analysis  
All data were transcribed from the clinical research forms into REDCap (institutionally managed by 
[CONTACT_513738], Reno), a web-based, password protected relational database and forms were 
secured in locked files. Data were subsequently imported into SPSS (v. 25) for analyses. Potential 
differences in socio-demographic variables were examined using chi-square analyses with Bonferroni-
corrected post- hoc comparisons, except for “age”, which was tested using an independent -samples t-
test. Examination of VAS scores demonstrated skewness issues, and hence data were rank transformed 
for these variables. Mann-Whitney tests were utilized for comparing the treatment arms on outcomes 
with VAS measurements, except for pain. The pain variable was time-based, and hence we examined 
potential temporal trends in pain at [ADDRESS_665761]-procedure using a 
repeated-measures general linear model with baseline pain as a covariate; the RM-ANOVA provided the 
same statistical interpretation as the rank-based transformation, and hence the standard RM-ANOVA 
results are presented below.

1.1.  Rehabilitation for Total Knee Replacement 
Physical therapy (PT) is an important component of care for patients who have total knee 
replacement (TKR) surgery.  The focus of this rehabilitative care is to promote mobilization and 
the achievement of functional goals.  A meta-analysis evaluating the effectiveness of post-
surgical PT in [ADDRESS_130815] both in real-time and 
asynchronously (e.g., patient completes recommended activities and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_117246]) can alleviate scheduling issues for both the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_117247], allowing therapi[INVESTIGATOR_117248] (higher case load) and patients 
to follow recommendations and complete activities when most convenient.  Having the PT 
program entirely available to the patient via technology may be cost efficient for both the patient 
and health system as more therapy sessions could be completed by [CONTACT_117266], without co-pays, and requiring less real-time PT supervision over time.  The primary 
aim of this project is to determine if a technology-supported home-based PT rehabilitation 
program is a cost-saving approach and at least clinically equivalent to traditional PT. 
 
VERITAS Protocol v1.4 
March 2, 2017  Page 3 of 16 2. Study Aims 
The goals of this research study are the following: 
 
1. To compare the effects of tele-rehab-supported PT versus traditional home and/or 
clinic-based PT for TKR on 90-day health service use costs.   
Hypothesis (Superiority):  Patients who receive tele-rehab-supported PT will have 
lower total 90-day epi[INVESTIGATOR_117249]. 
 
2. To compare tele-rehab-supported PT and traditional PT on patient-centered outcomes   
a. Effectiveness hypothesis (Non-Inferiority):  The tele -rehab intervention will be 
non-inferior to traditional PT at 6 weeks (differences between groups <5% for 
clinical and patient-reported outcomes) and 12 weeks (difference <5% patient-
reported outcomes).  
b. Safety hypothesis (Non-Inferiority):  The tele-rehab intervention will be non-
inferior to traditional PT at 12 weeks (pain, self-reported number of re-
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_117250]).  
 
3. To explore whether individual patient characteristics are associated with differential 
improvemen t from 6 to 12 weeks assessed by [CONTACT_4676]-reported outcomes. 
  
 
3. Study Design 
3.1.  General Overview 
VERITAS (Virtual Exercise Rehabilitation In-home Therapy: A randomized Study) is a 
multicenter randomized clinical trial aimed at evaluating the costs and clinical effectiveness of 
technology-supported home-based PT compared with traditional PT in the home or clinic.  
Patients in both groups will be prescribed exercises by a physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_117251]: VERA ™ in the home with virtual PT support 
compared with PT provided through traditional methods (e.g., h ome health, clinic, printed 
instructions).  This study will recruit approximately 6 practice groups to enroll 300 patients with 
unilateral TKR who are planned to return home after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]. 
  
This study will be undertaken only after the site’s Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) or 
Institutional Review Board (IRB) of record has given full approval of the final protocol, 
informed consent form, and applicable patient recruitment materials.  Site coordinators will also 
need to complete appropriate training on the protocol and data collection systems prior to being 
activated for enrollment.   Participating sites may begin screening patients upon written 
authorization from DCRI Coordinating Center staff. 
 
Once authorized to begin, sites will pre-screen patients scheduled for TKR for eligibility.  Those 
appearing to meet the inclusion criteria will be approached by [CONTACT_117267].  Those who qualify and express interest will be scheduled to meet with the site 
coordinator when they come in for their pre-operative clinic visit.  If the pre-operative visit 
timing is not conducive to enrollment, the site coordinator may schedule a separate visit for 
enrollment purposes.  The baseline study visit will be completed at leas t [ADDRESS_130816], receive recommendations for a pre-operative exercise program (“prehab”) , and 
continue the recommended tele-rehab PT program after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_117252].  Control group patients will follow the clini cal team’s recommendations 
for PT as organized and delivered in traditional care (home health, clinic, paper instructions). 
There are no differences in risk to patients between the two study arms.   
 
Data capture will occur at the following time points, and is detailed in Table 1 below: 
 Pre-enrollment:  Screening log (monthly submission) 
 Baseline (10  or more days prior to surgery):  Randomization form, patient contact 
[CONTACT_117268], patient surveys, case report form 
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]:  Case report form 
 6 weeks after surgery:  Case report form, patient surveys and diary (collected by [CONTACT_117269])  
 12 weeks after surgery:  Patient surveys and diary (collected by [CONTACT_117270]), chart 
review for service utilization (among select sites)

VERITAS Protocol v1.4 
March 2, 2017  Page 5 of 16 3.2.  Site Selection Criteria 
Approximately 6 orthopedic surgical practice groups will be selected to enroll patients in the 
VERITAS clinical trial.  Sites will be identified and approached based on estimated surgery 
volume, and the availability of staff resources to support successful participation.  Site selection 
will be limited geographically to a 50-mile radius around the Durham-Chapel Hill 
Comprehensive Joint Replacement (CJR) bundle region to minimize the variation of in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_117253]. Site start-up may be staged to allow for controlled run-in of the first patients at each site. 
 
3.3.  Patient Selection Criteria 
3.3.1.  Inclusion Criteria 
Patients are eligible to be included in the trial if they meet the following criteria: 
 ≥ 18 years of age  
 Scheduled to have a non-traumatic T KR 
 Can be enrolled a minimum of 10 days prior to surgery (in-person visit) 
 Have a Risk Assessment and Prediction Tool (RAPT) score of ≥ 6 indicating 
expected discharge home after surgical hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
 
3.3.2.  Exclusion Criteria 
Patients are excluded if they meet any of the following criteria: 
 Unable or unwilling to provide informed consent, including but not 
limited to cognitive or language barriers (comprehension) 
 Scheduled for staged bilateral TKR 
 Living in a nursing home prior to surgery 
 
3.4 Study Arms 
This study will enroll 150 patients into each of two groups, for a total enrollment of 300 
patients. 
 
3.4.1  Tele-rehab (Intervention) Group 
The tele-rehab PT-supported system for this study is the Virtual Exercise Rehabilitation 
Assistant (VERA ™) system developed by [CONTACT_117272].  VERA™  is a cloud-based 
virtual tele-health system that functions using 3D motion tracking technology to measure 
motion, remotely monitor the effectiveness of a prescribed regimen, and provide detailed 
audible instructions and immediate feedback to patients on exercise quality.  A therapi[INVESTIGATOR_117254] a therapy regimen through the clinician interface, and 
the VERA ™ system installed in the patient’s home delivers the therapy using interactive,  
motion-capturing technology and an avatar to demonstrate, track, and monitor the 
patient’s exercise performance.  Patients are able to view their own progress in the 
system and perform prescribed exercises and activities selected by [CONTACT_117273][INVESTIGATOR_541].  Performance is remotely monitored either in real-time or asynchronously, and 
as in traditional PT, the program of activities can be revised by [CONTACT_20826][INVESTIGATOR_117255].  The therapi[INVESTIGATOR_117256] “meet” for virtual 
real-time appointments as needed.  The VERA ™ system received FDA 510(k) clearance 
in October, 2015, and is available on the public market for purchase by [CONTACT_50902].    
 
VERITAS Protocol v1.4 
March 2, 2017  Page 6 of 16 The coordinating center will organize VERA ™ installation into patients’ homes  for those 
randomized to the intervention group.  Participants will be contact[CONTACT_117274].  After installation, 
the intervention patients will virtually meet with the physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_117257].  
All patients in the intervention arm will have their PT regimen designed and monitored 
by a study PT based in the Duke Department of PT/OT, using the remote clinician 
interface that is incorporated into  the VERA ™ platform.   
 
After the system is in the patient’s  home and the patient has spoken with the study 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541], s/he will be encouraged to access the system to begin pre-operative activities 
and become familiar with the system.  Patients will be able to access the system as often 
as they like.  Participants who do not interact with the system during the first [ADDRESS_130819]-discharge therapy, s/he may escalate the patient back to the orthopedic 
surgeon’s office for assessment.  This assessment may include the prescription of 
supplemental PT with one or more local, in- person visits, at the orthopedic surgeon’s 
discretion, to be completed in addition to continuing with in-home PT sessions via the 
tele-rehab platform.  A VERA™ progress report from the study therapi[INVESTIGATOR_117258] 6-week follow-up visit.  
Discharge from VERA ™ will be determined by [CONTACT_117275][INVESTIGATOR_541]. 
 
Patients will be given a telephone number to contact [CONTACT_117276] ™.  These telephone contacts will 
not involve any program participation guidance in order to ensure validity of the study 
results.    
 
3.4.2  Traditional PT (Control) Group 
Patients randomized to traditional PT will complete care as usual.  This includes prehab 
as recommended by [CONTACT_16529], in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10422], and home health or clinic-
based PT as directed by [CONTACT_6098].  There will be no restriction on the timing or 
number of PT encounters.  
 
3.[ADDRESS_130820] patient-reported 
information regarding health.  Domains of health data will include knee feeling and function, 
overall perception of his/her own health, activity level, pain, falls, and health service utilization.  
Assessments will be collected at multiple time points throughout the study, and include the 
following items: 
VERITAS Protocol v1.4 
March 2, 2017  Page 7 of 16  Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS)9 – pain, symptoms, 
activities of daily living, function in sports and recreation, and knee-related 
quality of life. 
 Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Global 
Health survey10 – outcomes and health-related quality of life. 
 Satisfaction with Physical Function questionnaire11 – satisfaction with ability to 
complete basic functional tasks. 
 Physical activity – frequency and duration of moderate activity/exercise. 
 Pain – scale from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain imaginable). 
 Falls – number occurring since last contact. 
 Return to work – resumption of pre-injury working status 
 Health service utilization – healthcare encounters including office visits, phone 
calls and emails, and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602].  Captured with the aid of a patient diary 
tool (see section 4.2.5). 
 
3.6 Data Collection Methods 
Three data collection methodologies will be used for this study:  an Excel spreadsheet to track 
patient screening, a web-based data capture system for use by [CONTACT_117277], and a Call Center to perform patient follow-up interviews. 
 
3.6.[ADDRESS_130821] protected web-based electronic data collection tool 
(DCRI Registry System) for site coordinators to abstract medical record  information 
about each patient after informed consent is obtained.  Collection time points include 
randomization, baseline (enrollment visit), hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345], and 6 weeks after 
discharge.  Data are expected to be present in the patient’s medical record, either as 
standard of care or as documented for study purposes. 
 
Access to the data capture system is role-based, with each authorized person receiving a 
unique user ID and password with appropriate permissions.  Prior to being granted access 
to the system, site staff will be required to undergo appropriate training by [CONTACT_117278].  
 
3.6.[ADDRESS_130822] form at the time of consent.  Additionally, the Call Center 
VERITAS Protocol v1.4 
March 2, 2017  Page 8 of 16 provides a toll-free number for patients to use to either complete their follow-up 
interviews, or to schedule their interviews at a convenient time.  The Call Center is 
staffed days, nights, and weekends to facilitate a high completion rate.  Interviewers 
receive standardized training in data collection, and follow a prepared script to minimize 
variation and missing variables. 
 
 
4.  Study Procedures 
4.1. Screening and Informed Consent 
After obtaining written authorization from the DCRI Coordinating Center that study activities 
may begin, the site coordinator will review participating surgeons ’ schedules for adult patients 
(age ≥ 18) scheduled for TKR at least [ADDRESS_130823], and complete the pre-screening assessment of RAPT score and living 
situation (not in a nursing home).  If the patient qualifies and is interested, he or she will be 
asked to meet with study staff during his/her regular pre-op visit to further discuss the study, and 
be enrolled if he/she agrees. 
 
It is expected that enrollment (consent, medical record release, and patient contact [CONTACT_3031]) 
and baseline data collection (surveys) will be completed concurrently with the routine pre-op 
visit.  If this is not possible, a separate study visit can be scheduled for this purpose.  
Additionally, patients who are unable to be contact[CONTACT_117279]-op visit, but still able to 
meet the requirement for enrollment at least [ADDRESS_130824] not been finalized at the time of the enrollment visit 
may be enrolled, but should not be randomized until the surgery date is scheduled.  Sites should 
not submit baseline enrollment materials (signed consent, medical record release, contact [CONTACT_982], 
and baseline survey) to the DCRI Coordinating Center until randomization occurs.  
 
Regardless of timing for the interest assessment, screening procedures, and randomization, all 
enrollment, baseline data collection, and randomization activities must be completed at least 10 
days prior to the patient’s surgery date.   Otherwise, the patient will be considered ineligible. 
 
Information regarding all screened patients will be documented on a study screening log 
(spreadsheet) and submitted to the DCRI Coordinating Center on a monthly basis via email.  The 
log will contain de-identified information regarding all patients who were screened, were 
excluded (RAPT < 6, nursing home resident, scheduled for bilateral TKR, unable to consent, 
unable to enroll at least 10 days prior to surgery), declined to participate, or were enrolled. 
 
Each patient who agrees to participate must provide written consent in person, prior to 
completing any study activities.   The informed consent explains to potential patients the study 
aims, procedures, and any potential risks.  Patients will be informed that their participation is 
voluntary and that they may withdraw consent to participate at any time without affecting their 
care in any way.   They will be given sufficient time to review the informed consent document, 
discuss the consent with the investigator or an authorized member of the investigational staff, ask 
any additional questions, and record consent by [CONTACT_117280].  The patient will 
VERITAS Protocol v1.4 
March 2, 2017  Page 9 of 16 receive a copy of the signed consent form.  Only the patient is authorized to provide written 
informed consent, unless an alternative consent method (e.g., a legally authorized representative) 
has been approved in advance by [CONTACT_117281]’s IRB of 
record.  
 
A copy of the signed informed consent will be faxed to the DCRI Call Center within 1 business 
day of randomization.  The original signed paper document will be retained by [CONTACT_117282] a secure location, according to the site’s IRB -approved procedures. 
 
4.2.  Baseline  
The following procedures will be completed at the enrollment/baseline study visit, which will be 
performed during the routine pre-op visit whenever possible.  All baseline activities must be 
completed no less than 10 days  prior to the patient’s surgery date.    
 
4.2.1  Randomization  
After providing written informed consent, patients will be randomized to either 
traditional PT or the tele-rehab platform for PT.  Site coordinators will obtain the 
patient’s assignment by [CONTACT_12550] a short randomization form in the DCRI Registry 
System.  After saving the form with a Complete status, the system will return a 
randomization result.  The coordinator will note this information in the patient’s study 
record, as it will be required in order to manage the patient’s discharge orders for 
traditional PT services versus the tele-rehab system.  Randomization assignment will also 
be recorded on the baseline DCF. 
 
If the patient’s surgery date is known at the time of the enrollment/baseline visit, 
randomization may be completed during the visit, before or after collection of the patient 
contact [CONTACT_982], medical record release, and patient-reported baseline assessments (see 
sections 4.2.2 and 4.2.3 below).   
 
If a patient’s surgery date is not known at the time of the enrollment/baseline visit, the 
patient contact [CONTACT_982], medical record release , and patient-reported baseline assessments 
may still be completed, but randomization should be postponed.  All documents should 
be held at the site until a surgery date is selected, at which time randomization may occur 
and documents may be submitted to the DCRI Call Center.   
 
In either case, randomization must occur no less than 10 days prior to the patient’s 
surgery date, or the patient will be considered ineligible. 
   
4.2.[ADDRESS_130825] release form will be 
faxed to the DCRI Call Center within 1 business day of randomization.  If a patient’s 
surgery date is unknown at the time of consent, a patient contact [CONTACT_117283], but randomization should be postponed.  All documents 
should be held at the site until a surgery date is selected, at which time randomization 
may occur and documents may be submitted to the DCRI Call Center.  The original 
documents will be retained by [CONTACT_117284] a 
secure location, according to the site’s IRB-approved procedures. 
 
4.2.[ADDRESS_130826] 10 days prior to the 
patient’s surgery date : 
 Surveys regarding health ( KOOS , PROMIS Global Health, Satisfaction with 
Physical Function Scale) 
 Physical activity 
 Falls and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_117259] 3 months 
 Comfort with using technology 
 Self-selected personal goal for recovery 
 
Copi[INVESTIGATOR_117260]-reported baseline assessments will be faxed to the DCRI 
Call Center within 1 business day of randomization.   If a patient’s surgery date is 
unknown at the time of consent, baseline assessments may still be completed, but 
randomization should be postponed.  All documents should be held at the site until a 
surgery date is selected, at which time randomization may occur and documents may be 
submitted to the DCRI Call Center.  The original documents will be retained by [CONTACT_117285] a secure location,  according to the site’s 
IRB-approved procedures. 
 
4.2.4 Baseline Case Report Form 
The following patient data will be collected: 
 Socio-demographic information 
 Medical history and comorbidities 
 Vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, 10m gait speed) including height and 
weight 
 
4.2.[ADDRESS_130827] will include in-person PT visits, doctor visits, phone calls or emails to a 
PT or doctor, visits to an urgent care center or emergency room, and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602].  Patients 
will also be instructed to rate weekly (on Sunday) their level of achievement of their self-selected 
VERITAS Protocol v1.[ADDRESS_130828] assessments for gait speed and range of 
motion (ROM) in the operated knee.  Study coordinators may need to coordinate with the clinic 
team to ensure these data are documented consistently in the medical record. 
 
The study coordinator is expected to enter these data on the 6-week data collection form in the 
DCRI Registry System within [ADDRESS_130829] 
20-30 minutes: 
 Survey regarding health (KOOS) 
 Adherence to prescribed PT regimen 
 Pain  
 Physical activity  
 Falls since hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345] 
 Healthcare encounters since hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345], and weekly status of personal recovery 
goal (patient diary entries) 
 
VERITAS Protocol v1.[ADDRESS_130830] 
approximately 20 minutes: 
 Surveys regarding health (KOOS, PROMIS, Satisfaction with Physical Function) 
 Adherence to prescribed PT regimen 
 Physical activity  
 Falls since last interview 
 Healthcare encounters since last interview, and weekly status of personal recovery goal 
(patient diary entries) 
 Thoughts about the tele-rehab platform (intervention patients only) 
 
Also at [ADDRESS_130831] sites may be asked to provide a summary of enrolled 
patients’ outpatient clinic encounters (phone, email, in person) with orthopedic staff and physical 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437].  This may be used to validate patient-reported encounters from the diary.  Collection 
of the information, if requested, may be facilitated using the medical record release form signed 
by [CONTACT_117286]. 
 
 
5. Statistical Methods 
The goal of this study is to assess the cost of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_117261], and 
whether the use of a tele-rehab platform is successful in mitigating some of those costs.  The 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_117262] [ADDRESS_130832]-discharge, in alignment with the 
new Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement (CJR) bundled payment model being pi[INVESTIGATOR_117263] (CMS).  This will be a time-driven activity-
based cost (TDABC) analysis.  DCRI will be responsible for regular reporting of enrollment 
statistics, data quality, and data query status to the sponsor. 
 
In addition to assessing the primary objective of cost, the study also will assess standard clinical 
measures of recovery (range of motion, gait speed) and qualitative measures of patient 
perceptions regarding their health and functional status (patient surveys) using both standardized 
and non-standardized tools.  These assessments are intended to demonstrate the non-inferiority 
hypothesis that patients receiving PT via the tele-rehab platform did not have worse outcomes 
than patients receiving traditional in-person PT.  
 
5.1.  Sample Size  
The primary aim of this study is to assess the difference in outpatient post-surgical costs between 
the control and intervention groups.  The exact post-procedure cost estimates under study are 
unknown; however, we can estimate that an effect size of approximately 0.[ADDRESS_130833] 80% power.  The effect size is the ratio of the mean 
difference over the standard deviation (SD) assumed for each population, while the coefficient of 
variation (CV) is the ratio of the population mean over the SD.  Lower variability would enable 
detection of a smaller cost difference,  or the detection of a larger difference with fewer patients.  
The below table gives several mean ratios that could be detected with 80% power and 300 
subjects where R1 is the ratio of the means (Control / Intervention) at which the power is 
calculated using a two-sample t-test with equal variance and a significance level of 0.05.   
VERITAS Protocol v1.[ADDRESS_130834] 80% power that is dependent on the variability 
of the costs under study.  The below table illustrates some example cost differences that could be 
detected based on the assumed SD of the costs.   
Standard Deviation 
(SD)  Mean Cost 
Difference ($)   Standard Deviation 
(SD)  Mean Cost 
Difference ($)  
[ADDRESS_130835] difference expected is around $500, then the SD should be no more than $[ADDRESS_130836] 80% power.  If the cost difference is around $200 then the SD would 
need to be no more than $600.  
 
5.2.  Data Analyses 
Data will be analyzed as intent- to-treat, therefore all randomized patients will be included for 
analysis as randomized, regardless of whether or not they completed all protocol requirements.  
The exception will be if a patient withdraws consent to participation and requests in writing that 
all data previously collected be removed from the study. 
VERITAS Protocol v1.4 
March 2, 2017  Page 14 of 16 Baseline patient demographics, clinical characteristics, and outcomes assessed at each time point 
will be summarized overall and for each group.  Continuous variables will be summarized using 
the mean, SD, median, inner-quartile range (IQR) and range, while categorical variables will be 
presented using counts and percentages.  The primary cost comparisons will be done using a t-
test if data are normally distributed or can be normalized using a transformation such as the 
logarithm or square root, otherwise, the nonparametric Wilcoxon Rank sum test will be used.   
 
All analyses will be completed using SAS version 9.4 or higher, and a p-value < 0.[ADDRESS_130837] why the data are missing. 
 
 
6.  Ethical Considerations and Trial Oversight  
6.1.  Ethical Considerations  
This trial will be submitted to an IEC or IRB (local or central) for approval. Minimum 
supporting documentation includes the final protocol, informed consent form, data collection 
forms, surveys and interview scripts, and applicable patient recruitment materials.  Progress 
reports will be submitted to IRBs and regulatory authorities as required by [CONTACT_83344].  This tri al will be conducted in accordance with the ethical principles that have their 
origin in the Declaration of Helsinki and are consistent with good clinical practices and 
applicable laws and regulations of the institution where the trial is being conducted, as 
appropriate.  
 
As part of local IRB submission for the study, sites will be expected to outline their proposed 
methods and timeline for completing procedures to assess patient interest and pre-screen for 
eligibility.  Sites also will be expected to obtain IRB approval for verbally consenting the patient 
before completing the RAPT score assessment in order to determine eligibility.  
 
The patient will provide authorization for the uses and disclosure of their personal health 
information as described in the informed consent form. The confidential nature of the patient 
information will be maintained.  
 
6.2.  Trial Oversight  
Trial  operation management and scientific oversight for VERITAS will be performed by [CONTACT_117287] (DCRI).  Sites will be provided with both telephone numbers and 
email addresses, as appropriate, to contact [CONTACT_117288], which generally 
will be available from 8 am – 5 pm Eastern Time Monday through Friday, excluding holidays.  
VERITAS Protocol v1.4 
March 2, 2017  Page 15 of 16 Throughout the study, DCRI will maintain records of all issues and resolutions when a site is 
assisted.   
 
6.3.  Trial Leadership  
Duke University and Duke Clinical Research Institute (DCRI),  along with the sponsor, Reflexion 
Inc., will be responsible for VERITAS design, implementation, and leadership.  Data analysis 
and publications will be managed according to a written plan designed to maintain appropriate 
scientific oversight and rigor.    
 
 
7.  Administrative Requirements  
7.1.  Study Completion  
Study enrollment will continue until [ADDRESS_130838] approximately 10 months. The study will be considered complete upon completion of all 
study-related procedures (data collection) for the last patient enrolled.  
 
7.2 Adverse Experience Reporting 
Reporting of any adverse experiences discovered during the course of the study will be the 
responsibility of care providers at the site, and should be made using the appropriate mechanism 
(e.g., FDA Medwatch). 
 
7.3.  Source Documentation  
At a minimum, source documentation must be available to substantiate patient identification, 
eligibility, participation, and proper informed consent procedures.  Specific items required as 
source documents will be reviewed with the investigator before the study. 
 
7.[ADDRESS_130839]-surgical PT, 
sites will not receive on-site monitoring visit(s) for this study. However, the investigator/ 
institution will maintain all source documents that support the data collected regarding each 
patient, as well as all study documents as specified by [CONTACT_8146](s). 
If the responsible investigator retires, relocates, or for other reasons withdraws from the 
responsibility of keepi[INVESTIGATOR_8090], custody must be transferred to a person who will 
accept the responsibility.  DCRI must be notified in writing of the name [CONTACT_66903].  If it becomes necessary for the sponsor or the appropriate regulatory authority to 
review any documentation relating to this study, the investigator must permit access to all study 
documentation.

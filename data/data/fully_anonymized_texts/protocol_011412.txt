 After a Screening visit up to 28 days before Baseline, approximately 200 
patients will be assigned randomly in a 1:1:1:[ADDRESS_203437]  doses (20 mg, 30 mg,  or 40 mg) or placebo  twice  daily  (BID)  for 
16 weeks, with a 4 -week Follow -up visit. Administration will begin at 
Baseline with a dose titration period. The maximum duration of study 
participation is approximately 24 weeks.  
Patients will be seen at the site on Screening, Baseline (Day 1), and Weeks 
1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16 (End -of-Treatment  visit),  and 20 (Follow-up visit,  4 weeks 
after treatment completion or discontinuation). Visits at Weeks 1 and 2 
could be conducted via a telemedicine procedure at Investigator’s 
discretion.  
At Baseline and each visit from Week 4 onwards,  PASI, BSA, IGA, and 
PSS will be assessed.  Quality  of life will be assessed  by [CONTACT_174269] 16 and 20 visits. Additional efficacy 
parameters include: an ss -IGA, a  Physician Global Assessment of 
fingernail psoriasis (PGA -F), and  
. These  parameters  will be assessed  at Baseline  and Weeks 
16 and 20.  Safety  evaluations include adverse events (AEs), laboratory  and 
vital sign assessments, physical examinations, as well as mood change 
evaluation  by [CONTACT_4676]  (Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5620]) and suicidal 
ideation evaluation by [CONTACT_10670] (C -SSRS). A panel of cardiovascular 
risk factors will be assessed at Baseline and Week 16.  
Before administration of the study drug at Baseline and on Weeks 4, 8, 
and 16, blood will be collected  for orismilast  concentration  determination.

positive response (yes)  to questions [ADDRESS_203442] order  or by [CONTACT_174270].  
Planned  Sample  Size:  Approximately 200 patients will be enrolled to ensure approximately 
50 patients  per arm. This sample  size is based  on assumptions that the 
percentage  change from  Baseline  in PASI  is -32.2% and -50.9% for placebo 
and each orismilast dose group, respectively, and the standard deviation is 
33%. Using a [ADDRESS_203443], 50 patients in  each treatment arm  can 
achieve a power of 80% at the significance level of 5%.

Reference  Therapy:  Matching  placebo  tablets  
Treatment  Duration:  The Treatment  Period  for this study is 16 weeks,  with a 4-week  Follow-up 
visit. Refer to Table 2 for the dose titration schedule.  
Pharmacokinetics  The plasma  levels  of the drug and its metabolites  will be summarized 
descriptively by [CONTACT_80183].  
Patients  will be offered  optional participation  in specific  blood sampling  for 
calculation of pharmacokinetic profiles.  
Statistical  Methods  and 
Planned Analyses:  For inferential  analyses  of primary  and secondary  efficacy  endpoints, each 
active treatment group will be compared with the placebo group.  
Primary and secondary efficacy endpoints are to be assessed in the 
Intention- to-Treat  (ITT)  Analysis Population. Missing  data for primary  and 
key secondary  endpoints will be  handled with multiple  imputation method. 
For categorical efficacy endpoint based on a continuous variable, the 
multiple imputation will be first done for the continuous variable, then 
determine  the category  using the imputed  values. Analys es will be repeated 
on the Per -Protocol Population for primary and secondary endpoints.  
When  appropriate, the raw parameter,  its change from  Baseline,  and 
percentage change from Baseline will be summarized.  
The primary endpoint, percentage change from Baseline to Week 16 in 
PASI,  will be analyzed  using analysis  of covariance  with treatment  group as 
factor and Baseline PASI as covariate. The mixed model for repeated 
measures (MMRM) will be used as a supportive analysis. Each active 
treatment dose will be compared with placebo. No adjustment for 
multiplicity will be made and the 0.[ADDRESS_203444] square means and the 95% 
confidence interval of the difference between each active treatment and 
placebo will be calculated. The primary analysis set will be the ITT 
Analysis Population with multiple imputation approach to handle missing 
values. The same analyses will be repeated for Weeks 20, 12, 8 and 4.  
The key secondary and other binary endpoints (IGA success, PASI50, 
PASI75, PASI90) will  be analyzed using  the Mantel -Haenszel (MH) test, 
comparing each active  treatment  group to placebo  in the ITT Analysis set. 
For categorical  variables,  the MH procedure, with ridit scores,  will be used; 
this test is the same as the nonparametric Wilcoxon test and enhances the 
analysis when the parameter is not normally distributed. Graphics will be 
added to facilitate interpretation. IGA scores/full scale will be analyzed 
using the MH test and the r ow mean score statistics and the ridit 
transformation.  
The other continuous secondary  endpoints will be analyzed  using MMRM.  
The above endpoints (PASI  changes  and percentage  changes,  IGA success, 
PASI50, PASI75, PASI90) and the percentage change of BSA wil l be 
presented graphically over time from Baseline to Week 20. In addition, 
shift tables will be provided between Baseline and each visit for the IGA 
distribution. The PASI  percentage  changes  from  Baseline  will be plotted to 
identify where the best separation between treatments occurs.  
All safety  analyses  will be conducted using the Safety  Analysis Population. 
AE data will be presented and tabulated according to Medical Dictionary  
for Regulatory Activities  (MedDRA)  classification.  Reported AEs  will be 
summarized by  [CONTACT_80181], as well as by  
[CONTACT_174267]  A/S

 5. INTRODUCTION  
 
5.1. Background on Plaque -Type Psoriasis  
 
Psoriasis  is a multisystem  disease  with predominantly skin and joint manifestations  characterized 
by [CONTACT_10070]-demarcated, erythematous, scaly  plaques which are often itchy. Psoriasis is considered a 
systemic disease; it is associated with psychological, metabolic, arthri tic, and cardiovascular 
comor bidities. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_174241], w ith studies 
conducted mainly in Europe and North America ( Parisi 2020 ). Reported prevalence of psoriasis 
in adults varies  from about 1.4% in the United  States (US)  to 2.5% in Wester n or Eastern  Europe 
(https:/ /www.globalpsori asisatlas.org/statistics/statistics).  
The most common clinical type of psoriasis, affecting 80% to 90% of patients, is psoriasis 
vulgaris (plaque-type psoriasis). For patients with moderate- to-severe plaque -type psoriasis who 
comprise about one-t hird of all psoriasis patients, systemic agents (biological or nonbi ological) 
or phototherapy is the regimen  of choice ( Menter  2009, 2010 ). However, the long- term treatment 
of psoriasis with biological therapi[INVESTIGATOR_174242], reduced 
efficacy over time, and poor adherence due to an inconvenient route of administration (eg, 
injection) ( Ravindran 2008 ). Therefore, despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a large number of biologic agents being 
available, there is still an unmet need for safe, effective, and convenient long -term oral 
treatments for patients with moderate -to-severe psoriasis.  
The involvement of inflammatory cells, such as T cells and myeloid dendritic  cells, and 
proinflammatory cytokines,  such as tumor necrosis factor -alpha (TNF -α), and interleukin (IL)-12 
and IL- 17 in the pathogenesis of psoriasis is well established ( Quaglino 2011 ). 
Phosphodiesterases (PDEs)  constitute  a superfamily of enzymes  catalyzing  the hydrolysis of the 
intracellular second messengers cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and/ or cyclic 
guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) that play key roles in mediating biological responses 
generated by a variety of extracellular signals. PDE4 is a cAMP -specific PDE expressed by 
[CONTACT_174272], including neutrophils, T -lymphocytes, macrophages, and 
eosinophils. High cAMP levels decrease proliferation and cytokine production whereas low 
concentrations have the opposite effect. Specific inhibition of PDE4 thus  has the potential to 
have beneficial effects in a wide variety of inflammatory disorders includi ng rheumatoid 
arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, inflammatory bowel disease, airway disease, skin diseas e, and 
neuro inflammation. 
Currently marketed PDE4 inhibitors include roflumilast approved for chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease  (COPD), crisaborole for atopic  dermatitis,  and apremilast  approved for 
psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and oral ulcers associated with  Behcet’s disea se. 
One of the key challenges for an effective PDE4 therapy has been the narrow therapeu tic 
window. Most  of the programs investigating  PDE4  inhibitors failed  because  of safety  issues,  up 
until the approval of roflumilast for COPD, and apremilast for psoriasis and PsA some years 
later. Both therapi[INVESTIGATOR_80132], primarily, but  not exclusively, the

 gastrointestinal (GI) tract, characterized by [CONTACT_33234], vomiting, and diarrh ea/loose stools. These 
undesired GI effects  were  consistently  observed from the beginning of treatment,  and this led to 
the titration of  those drugs (apremilast over  [ADDRESS_203452] 1  month) to  reduce side effects.  
 
5.2. Background on Orismilast  
 
Orismilast is a PDE4 inhibitor currently  in Phase 2 of clinical development for oral treatment of 
various inflammatory  skin diseases  including hidradenitis suppurativa, plaque- type psoriasis  and 
atopic dermatitis. During initial development Phase 1/2a, different or al formulations have been 
tested in the clinic. Because the immediate -release tablet appeared to be less well tolerated 
compared with the drug in capsule formulation, newly developed oral Orismilast formulation 
concepts were  tested, and a modified -release formulation selected for further development. This 
new formulation was shown to improve the GI tolerability  without a significant loss in systemic 
exposure.  
 
5.2.1.  Nonclinical  Studies  
 
Both oral and topi[INVESTIGATOR_174243] -inflammatory effects in the 
chronic oxazolone mouse model, an animal model that shares some similarit ies with human 
atopic  dermatitis  (AD)  and chronic skin inflammation.  Oral admini stration  of orismilast  to mice 
also reduced levels of TNF -α in this model.  
The selectivity of orismilast has been investigated using a panel of 76 G  protein coupled 
receptors, 40 kinase assays,  and patch -clamp  tests with 8 cardiac  ion channels,  and no effe cts 
were seen except some inhibition of hERG ion channel current amplitudes at 10 μM.  
The pharmacokinetics  (PK)  of orismilast  has been  investigated  in mice,  rats, rabbits and minipi[INVESTIGATOR_174244]. In rats, area under the curve (AUC) and max imum plasma 
concentration (C max) generally increased in proportion to dose in the tested range (0.5–1.75 
mg/kg), with female rats having AUC and C max values 1.5 to 3 times higher than male rats. In 
mice, rabbits, and minipi[INVESTIGATOR_14107], AUC and C max increased less than, or proportional to, the 
investigated doses (5– 500 mg/kg, twice  daily  dosing, and 1.0–30 mg/kg, respectively), and AUC 
and C max values were generally comparable in  females and males. In a minipig telemetry study, 
mean concentrations increased less than proportionally to the investigated d oses (1.0 –10 mg/kg) 
and were lower in females than in males. There was little or no accumulation in mi ce, rats, 
rabbits, or minipi [INVESTIGATOR_14107]. Orismilast was excreted mainly via the faces in rats and minipi[INVESTIGATOR_14107].  
The in vitro plasma protein binding of orismilast was low to moderate (35–67%) in a variety of 
species  tested  (mouse, rat, rabbit, minipig,  and human). The in vitro metabolism  of orismi last has 
been investigated using hepatocytes from mouse, rat, hamster, rabbit, minipig, dog, marmoset, 
cynomolgus monkey, and human. The extent of metabolism was generally low. 
In safety  pharmacology assessments,  the in vitro assessment  of the effect  on hERG tail current 
recorded from human embryonic kidney (HEK- 293) cells gave an IC50 value of 11.4 μM. In  
UNION  therapeutics  A/S 
Orismilast  UNI50001 -[ADDRESS_203453] pr oduced no treatment - related 
effects  on heart rate, body temperature,  QRS,  QT or QTcR  intervals  or electrocardiogram (ECG) 
morphology. An increase  in systolic  blood pressure was observed in minipi[INVESTIGATOR_174245] (10 mg/kg). No effect was observed on the central  nervous system  in a modified Irwin 
test or on respi[INVESTIGATOR_80136]. 
Orismilast  was not genotoxic when  tested  in the standard International Council for 
Harmonisation (ICH) battery of [ADDRESS_203454]  (LEO  [ZIP_CODE]) nor 
its major metabolite LEO [ADDRESS_203455] battery of 
genotoxicity testing that included in vitro Ames and mouse lymphom a assay testing and in vivo 
micronucleus testing (LEO [ZIP_CODE]). In addition, reproductive toxicity studies on fertility and 
early  embryonic development,  as well as embryo fetal development,  have been  conducted  across 
a range of time courses, dose, and exposure levels in rats, mice, minipi[INVESTIGATOR_14107], and rabbits. The 
weight of evidence from these nonclinical studies indicates that neither o rismilast nor its major 
metabolite LEO  [ADDRESS_203456] proposed clinical dosing regimen of 40 mg 
twice daily (BID; 80 mg/kg/day). 
Overall,  treatment  was well tolerated  at 1 mg/kg. Refer to the Investigator’s Brochure for further 
details on orismilast nonclinical studies.  
 
5.2.2.  Clinical  Studies  
 
As of [ADDRESS_203457]  clinical  development program in psoriasis consists of 
8 completed  trials  including  7 Phase  1 trials  in healthy  subjects  and 1 Phase  2a trial in subjects 
with moderate -to-severe psoriasis vulgaris. 
The completed trials include 2 dose -finding and PK trials using a solution and a capsule 
formulation (drug in capsule; trials LP0058-S01 and LP0058-1114), a PK trial using a capsule 
(drug in capsule)  and modified -release  tablets  (3 different release  profil es; trial LP0058-1005), a 
PK trial in healthy  Japanese men using  a tablet formulation (immediate release; LP0058 - 1362), 
a PK trial evaluating the PK and safety/tolerability profiles of several new f ormulations 
(LP0058-1442), [ADDRESS_203458] immediate -release tablet  
formulation and midazolam  (trial LP0058-1267 and LP0058-1324), and a proof of concept Phase 
2a trial using an immediate -release tablet formulation (trial LP0058 -1072). 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Clinical  Pharmacology  
After single and multiple dosing of up to [ADDRESS_203459]  was steadily  absorbed with a median  time 
to maximum  plasma  concentration  (tmax) of 2–[ADDRESS_203460]  increased 
in an approximately dose proportional manner. Estimates of elimination half- lives varied across

 studies, from 4–6 hours (for dose levels up to 30 mg 3 times a day) and up to 10 hours (for 60 
mg twice daily dose level). After multiple dosing of up to [ADDRESS_203461]  was observed. Dosing after a high- fat 
meal  delayed  tmax by 2 hours and increased area  under the curve from time 0 to infinity  (AUC 0-∞) 
by 40%, compared with dosing in the fasted state. 
Formation of the human- specific metabolite LEO [ADDRESS_203462],  suggesting formation rate-limited  elimination  of LEO  [ZIP_CODE]. The ratio of metabolite 
to parent compound was relatively constant across doses and upon repeated dosing, indicating 
that systemic exposure to LEO [ZIP_CODE] was approximately 53– 75% lower  than to orismilast.  
PDE4 enzymatic activity was measured in a scintillation proximity assay us ing purified human 
recombinant  PDE4D  protein. Orismilast  is a potent inhibitor  of PDE4D  activity.  LEO  [ADDRESS_203463] between races (LP0058-1362) or gender (LP0058-1114). 
Data from the LP0058 -1324 trial showed that the exposure of midazolam was more than 30% 
highe r when midazolam was administered at steady  state (Day  17) after administration of [ADDRESS_203464]  twice  daily  compared  with midazolam  alone (geometric  means  of 132% for area under 
the curve from time [ADDRESS_203465] measurable concentration [AUC 0-t] and 137% for C max). These 
results classify orismilast as a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4.  
Pharmacodynamic evaluation  from trial LP0058- S01 using an ex vivo cytokine release  assay 
indicated that orismilast inhibited the secretion of TNF -α and interferon gamma (IFN -γ). 
Maximum inhibition generally occurred between 4 –6 hours postdose. There was no clear dose- 
relationship in the maximal response or duration of inhibitory response. Mean decreases from 
Baseline to Day  7 ranged from approximately 67–70% for TNF- α and 52 –77% for INF- γ levels 
across dose groups receiving 10, [ADDRESS_203466]. In accordance, reduced 
levels of TNF -α, IFN -γ, macrophage inflammatory  protein-1 alpha (MIP- 1α), and MIP -1β were 
observed in lipopolysaccharide- stimulated blood from subjects treated with orismilast in the 
LP0058-[ADDRESS_203467]  were  present. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Efficacy  
So far one effi cacy trial (LP0058 -1072) with orismilast immediate -release tablets has been 
completed.  A total of 36 subjects with moderate -to-severe  psoriasis vulgaris were  randomized  in 
the trial in a 1:[ADDRESS_203468]  or placebo, administered  orally  as 
3 tablets twice daily for 16 weeks (1 -week dose escalation followed by 15- week full dose 
treatment).

 After  16 weeks  of treatment,  the mean  psoriasis area and severity  index  (PASI)  score (primary 
endpoint) was s tatistically significantly lower in subjects treated with orismilas t tablets (least 
squares mean: 7.1) compared with subjects in the placebo group (least squares mean: 13.1). 
Mean PASI at entry was 14.9. A higher proportion of patients achieved a 75% impro vement in 
PASI (PASI75) in the orismilast group (44.4%) vs placebo (5.6%; P =.019). In addition, 
treatment  success  (defined as clear  or almost  clear)  according to Physician’s Global Assessment 
of disease severity (PGA) at Week [ADDRESS_203469] group (7 of 18 subjects, 
38.9%) than in the placebo group (1 of 18 subjects, 5.6%). The estimated itch score was 
numerically lower at Week [ADDRESS_203470] group (least squares mean:  3.4) compared with 
the placebo group (least squares mean: 5.7).  
Approximately  half of the subjects in both treatment groups were withdrawn from the LP0058 -

estimated  efficacy,  it was not considered  to disqualify the clear  difference observed between  the 
2 treatments.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Safety 
Orismilast administered as capsules was safe and well tolerated in single dos es up to [ADDRESS_203472] was 
moderately well tolerated in multiple doses up to 50 mg twic e daily, after gradual up- titration to 
the 50 mg twice daily level over 8 days. Poor tolerability at the 60 mg dos e level was due to an 
increased  incidence  and severity  of GI adverse events  (AEs). This was most  likely  related  to high 
local concentrations o f orismilast in the GI tract, as the symptoms at the [ADDRESS_203473] tablets (30 mg twice daily) were poorly 
tolerated in subjects with moderate -to-severe psoriasis vulga ris. AEs leading  to withdrawal from 
the trial were reported for 50% of the subjects in the orismilast group compared with 16.7% in 
the placebo  group. In the orismilast group, the majority  of withdrawals  were  due to GI disorders.  
A total of 5 serious adverse events  (SAEs)  were  reported across all trials;  [ADDRESS_203474]  group had 
1 SAE each (ureterolithiasis, considered not related to the treatment, and ery sipelas on the arm, 
considered possibly related to the treatment), and [ADDRESS_203475] in the placebo group had 1 SAE 
(‘condition aggravated’, relating  to preexisting Scheuermann's disease  and considered not related 
to the treatment). In the LP0058 -[ADDRESS_203476] reported SAEs (abdominal pain and 
abdominal cramps, considered possibly related to the treatment).  
UNION  therapeutics  A/S 
Orismilast  UNI50001 -[ADDRESS_203477] -related AEs were GI 
disorders (par ticularly  nausea and diarrhea), nervous system  disorders (particularly  headache  and 
dizziness), and musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (particu larly back pain).  
 
5.3. Clinical  Risks/Benefits  
 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_174246] 2a study of the immediate - 
release  tablets  of orismilast,  this formulation presented  an undesirable safety  profile with 50% of 
patients prematurely discontinuing because of GI effects. To improve th e GI tolerance, several 
formulations were tested in an extensive Phase [ADDRESS_203478]  (AESI). Based  on the occurrence of GI or other AEs considered having a 
causal relationship with study treatment, the Investigator might co nsider decreasing the daily 
dosing regimen or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_80138] a few days, until recovery. Besides the above, all 
subjects will be monitored for any cardiovascular manifestations using v ital sign s and 12- lead 
ECG at each visit. Drug class potential effects such as weight loss and major  depression will be 
monitored during the study. Subjects with major depression, presenting major psychiatric 
disorders or at risk for suicide will be excluded from e nrollment, and suicidal ideation and 
depressive symptoms will be assessed in the course of the study by [CONTACT_174273]- Suicide Severity 
Rating Scale (C -SSRS) and Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5620] (HADS), respectively. 
Patients  will be informed of the potenti al increased  risk of depression or suicidal  thoughts of this 
class of drugs; and recommended to promptly contact [CONTACT_80191]. 
More detailed  information about the known and expected  benefits  and risks and reasonably 
expected AEs of orismilast may be found in the Investigator’s Brochure. 
 
5.4. Study  Rationale 
 
PDE4  inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy  in psoriasis and AD with 2 drugs having reached  the 
market: apremilast, an oral agent for the treatment of plaqu e-type psoriasis and crisaborole, a 
UNION  therapeutics  A/S 
Orismilast  UNI50001 -[ADDRESS_203479] is a novel PDE4 inhibi tor being developed for 
the oral treatment of psoriasis. After an extensive Phase I program in heal thy subjects and a 
Phase  2a study in patients  with moderate -to-severe psoriasis,  the clinical  development program is 
progressing into a Phase 2b dose-finding clinical study  using a modified -release oral formulation 
that is expected to present a more favorable safety profile.  
The purpose of this study is to assess  the efficacy  and safety  of 3 different dose levels  (20 mg, 30 
mg, or 40 mg) of orismilast administered orally BID over a period of 16 weeks in patients with 
moderate- to-severe plaque psoriasis. Efficacy and patient’s outcome will be assessed thro ugh a 
set of validated measures for psoriasis. In addition, PK and pharmacodynamic (PD) evaluations 
will be conducted. The results  of the study will inform the design and the dose level(s) of the 
subsequent Phase 3 program. 
 
5.4.1.  Dose  Rationale  
 
The modified- release  formulation was studied  in 1 clinical  trial (LP0058-1442) and administered 
in a total of 36 healthy volunteers: 18 in part 1, 9 in part 2, and 9 in part 3. Twenty-seven (27) 
healthy volunteers received a single administration of [ADDRESS_203480] declined in a generally biphasic manner for both formulations wit h 
geometric mean terminal half -life (t 1/2) values of 6.48 and 6.67 hours for the modified- release 
tablet  and immediate -relea se capsule,  respectively.  With  a geometric mean  value of 507 ng.h/mL 
for AUC 0-∞, systemic exposure to orismilast following administration of th e modified -release 
tablet was comparable to the one of the immediate -release capsules (506 ng.h/mL). Statistical 
analyses comparing key PK parameters of orismilast for both formulations did not show any 
significant difference. Exposure to LEO [ZIP_CODE] and LEO [ZIP_CODE], the main metabolites, appeared 
generally similar for the modified -release tablet and the immediate -releas e formulation. 
It can thus be concluded that the systemic exposure  following administration  of the 
modified -release formulation is not different from the one following the admi nistration of the 
immediate -release formulation. It can therefore be reasonably assumed that the safety pr ofile 
resulting from systemic effects can be extrapolated from studies having i nvestigated the 
immediate -release  formulation and in particular,  study LP0058-1072, a Phase  2a study  including 
36 patients with moderate to severe psoriasis vulgaris.

Orismilast  UNI50001 -[ADDRESS_203481], and there were no deaths or SAEs during any part of 
the trial. A  total of 113 AEs were reported: [ADDRESS_203482] or 
above. Nausea was reported in 5 subjects receiving LEO [ZIP_CODE], with the majority  of events 
occurring at the 60-mg dose level. Only 2 partici pants experienced nausea at a dose equal or 
lower to 40 mg, and these side effects lasted approximately 1 day before spontaneously 
disappearing, despi[INVESTIGATOR_80143]- titration being maintained.  
It was thus concluded that 40 mg BID was the maximal  tolerate d dose with 30 mg BID being the 
target dose for further development.

Individuals who sign the ICF to participate  in the study but who do not subsequently meet  all the 
requirements as outlined in the inclusion and exclusion criteria and t herefore do not enroll 
(screen  failures)  may be rescreened.  Such  individuals may be allowed  to rescreen  up to one time.  
 
8.4. Study  Withdrawal, Removal, and Replacement  of Patients  
 
If a patient  discontinues study treatment  and is withdrawn from the study for any reason, the 
study site must immediately notify the medical monitor. The date and  the reason for study 
discontinuation must be recorded on the electronic case report  form (eCRF). Patients who 
complete or discontinue early  from the study  will be asked to return to the study  site within  
[ADDRESS_203495] administration of  study drug to complete  EOT  assessments  as indicated  in the 
UNION  therapeutics  A/S 
Orismilast  UNI50001 -203 
Version  3.0 
This document is confidential.  
Page  36 of 92  
 Schedule of Assessments  (Table  4). If the study treatment  is permanently  discontinued,  the 
patient will remain in the study to be evaluated for safety.  
In the event  that a patient discontinues  prematurely from the study because  of a TEAE  or serious 
TEAE assessed as ≥G rade 3 (≥Grade 2 for the system organ class [SOC] of cardiac disorders) 
according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5 (CTCAE v 5), the 
TEAE or serious TEAE will be followed up until it resolves (returns to nor mal or Baseline 
values)  or stabilizes,  or until it is judged by [CONTACT_174276].  
Once  a patient is  withdrawn from the study, the patient  cannot reenter  the study.  
A patient  may voluntarily withdraw  or be withdrawn from the study at any time for reasons 
including, but not limited to, the following: 
• unacceptable  toxicity  or AE 
• patient’s  withdrawal  of consent: at  any time,  a patient’s  participation  in the study may be 
terminated at his/her request or on the basis of the Investigator’s clini cal judgment. The 
reason for patient withdrawal will be noted on the eCRF. 
• intercurrent illness:  a condition, injury, or disease  unrelated  to the primary diagnosis that 
became apparent during treatment and necessitated the patient’s termination  from the 
study  
• general or specific  changes  in the patient’s  condition that renders him/her  ineligible  for 
further treatment according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria  
• patient  fails to adhere to the protocol requirements  (eg, drug noncompliance, failure  to 
return for defined number of visits) 
• lost to Follow up: the patient stopped coming for visits,  and study personnel were  unable 
to contact [CONTACT_102]  
• pregnancy, as indicated  in Section  12.9.6 . 
Additionally, the Sponsor may stop the study at any time for safety, regulatory, legal, or other 
reasons aligned  with good clinical  practice  (GCP). This study may be terminated  at the discretion 
of the Sponsor or any regulatory agency. An Investigator may elect to discontinue or stop the 
study at his or her study site for any reason, including safety or low enrollment. 
 
8.5. Suspension  or Premature  Termination of the Clinical  Investigation 
 
The sponsor or  designee reserves  the right to close the study  site or terminate the  study  at any 
time for any reason at the sole  discretion  of the sponsor. Study sites will be  closed  upon study 
completion.  A study site is considered  closed  when  all required documents and study  supplies 
have been collected and a study -site closure visit has been performed.

 The Investigator may initiate  study- site closure at any time,  provided there is  reasonable cause 
and sufficient notice is given in advance of the intended termination.  
Reasons for the early  closure of a study site by [CONTACT_174277]:  
For study termination:  
• Discontinuation  of further development  of the study drug 
For site termination:  
• Failure of the Investigator to comply with the protocol, the requiremen ts of the 
institutional  review  board (IRB)/independent ethics  committee  (IEC) or local  health 
authorities, the sponsor's procedures, or GCP guidelines 
• Inadequ ate or no recruitment  (evaluated  after a reasonable amount of time)  of patients by 
[CONTACT_737].  
If the study is prematurely terminated or suspended, the sponsor shall promptly inform the 
investigators, the IECs/IRBs, the regulatory authorities,  and any contract research  organization(s) 
used in the study of the reason for termination or suspension, as specified by [CONTACT_11005]. The Investigator shall promptly inform the patient and should assure 
appropriate patient therapy and/or follow up.

9.2. Measures  to Minimize  Bias: Study  Treatments 
 
9.2.1.  Method of Study  Treatment Assignment  
 
At the investigational site, each screened patient will be assigned a patient id entifier number 
during Screening  that will be used on all patient  documentation. The patient  identifier  number 
will contain  the site number and the patient  number and will be assigned  in numerical order at 
the Screening visit based on chronological order of Screening dates (eg, 01-010 for the 10th 
patient screened at the Site #01).  
Randomization will occur prior to first study treatment administ ration, at the Baseline visit. 
Patients  will be assigned randomly in a 1:1:1:[ADDRESS_203501]  dose groups (20 mg, 30 
mg, or 40 mg) or placebo. 
UNION  therapeutics  A/S 
Orismilast  UNI50001 -[ADDRESS_203502] 
will be kept secured with access restricted to only the designated personnel di rectly responsible 
for labeling and handling the study drug until the study blind is broken at the end of study 
(database lock). Further guidance and information can be obtained in the s tudy manual.  
 
9.2.2.  Blinding  
 
To facilitate the double blind, the tablets will be packaged in the same type o f blister and the 
active and placebo tablets will have the same appearance (in terms of size, form,  weight, and 
color). One dose consists  of 2 identical  tablets  (a [ADDRESS_203503]  tablet  or a matching 
placebo).  
Blinding codes should only be broken in emergency situations for reasons of patient safety. 
When  the blind for a patient  has been  broken, the reason must  be fully documented in the source 
document and eCRF. Whenever possible, the Investigator should contact [CONTACT_174279]. If the blind is broken, the Investigator should promptly 
inform the medical monitor. Documentation of breaking the blind should be recorded with the 
date/t ime and reason why the blind was broken, and the names of the personnel involved. 
The patient  for whom the blind has been  broken will be discontinued  from the study and undergo 
the early termination procedures. The primary reason for discontinuation (the event or condition 
which led to the unblinding) will be recorded. 
The Interactive Web Response System (IWRS) will be programmed with blind -breaking 
instructions. In case of an emergency, the Investigator  has the sole responsibility for determining 
if unblinding of a patients’ treatment assignment is warranted. Patient  safety must always be the 
first consideration in making such a determination. If the Investigator decides that unblinding is 
warranted, the Investigator should make every effort to contact [CONTACT_1152] a 
patient’s treatment assignment unless this could delay emergency treatment o f the patient. If a 
patient’s treatment assignment is unblinded , the sponsor must be notified within [ADDRESS_203504] be recorded in the source 
documentation and case report form, as applicable.  
All patients  will be centrally  assigned  to randomized study treatment  using an IWRS. Before the 
study is initiated, the telephone number and call -in directions for the log in information and 
directions for the IWRS will be provided to each site.  
Study drug will be dispensed at the study visits  summ arized  in the Schedule of Assessments 
(Table 4). Returned study drug should not be redispensed to the patients.

 9.3. Dosage Modification  
 
If a patient experiences a TEAE assessed as ≥Grade 3 (≥Grade 2 for the SOC of Cardiac 
Disorders) according to CTCAE v 5, the patient  should be permanently discontinued from the 
study drug and not receive additional doses. As a reminder Grade 3 is defined as “Severe or 
medically significant but not immediately life threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_174249]; disabling; limiting self -care activities of daily living (ADL)”.  
If GI or other AEs considered  probably or definitely  related to the study drug are reported with a 
severity not compatible with maintaining the treatment as per protocol d uring the treatment up - 
titration and/or during maintenance period, the Investigator might con sider decreasing the 
regimen as described in Se ction 9.3.[ADDRESS_203505] was shown to improve the GI tolerance and over all acceptability of 
the drug ( Zerilli  2015 ). Similarly,  a slow  increase  in orismilast  dose was associated  with less GI 
side effects  when compared with a rapid increase. Consistent with this  approach, this study will 
titrate the study treatment dose over a period of maximum 2 weeks (see Table 2).  
If tolerability  issues  arise  during the treatment  up-titration  and/or during maintenance  period, the 
following treatment pauses are allowed only if instructed by [CONTACT_24342]:  
• First day: The Investigator is informed of the tolerability  issue;  thus, the evening dose can 
be skipped. 
• Second day: Morning dose can be skipped.  The patient must take  the evening  dose.  
• Third day: Similar  to Day 2, morning dose can be skipped. The patient  must  take the 
evening dose. 
• Fourth day: BID daily  dosing regimen  is reintroduced.  
The aforementioned treatment pauses do not impact calculation of dosing  days and duration of 
titration  is not prolonged. Treatment  pauses will be captured  in the eCRFs.  This titration  will not 
break the blind as all patients will receive [ADDRESS_203506] or placebo tablets 
BID.

9.4. Treatment Accountability  and Compliance 
 
The patients  will receive the  study drug at the site directly  from the Investigator  or designee who 
will also give instruction for dose administration. The date of study drug dispensed to the 
patients will be recorded in eCRF and patient’s source document. At all site vi sits, patients will 
return all study drug, including packaging, dispensed at the previous visit. 
The dose of study drug and study patient identification will be confirmed at the time of 
administration  by a member  of the study site staff other  than the person administering  the study 
drug.  
When patients self -administer the study drug at home, compliance with the protocol wil l be 
assessed  at each visit.  Compliance  will be assessed  by [CONTACT_174280].  
Deviation  from the prescribed dosage regimen should be recorded.  
A record of the quantity of study drug dispensed to and administered by [CONTACT_174281]. Study drug administration

9.5.3.  Drug -Drug  Interactions  
 
From clinical  studies,  orismilast  can be considered  a mild inhibitor  of CYP3A4/5, and systemic 
exposure to medicinal products metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A4 may be increased when co - 
administered with orismilast. Concomitant use of orismilast with CY P3A4 substrates may  
UNION  therapeutics  A/S 
Orismilast  UNI50001 -[ADDRESS_203510] a narrow therapeutic window. Refer to the following link for ex amples of clinical 
inhibitors for P450- mediated metabolisms: https: //www.fda .gov/drugs/drug- interactions - 
labeling/drug -developmen t-and-drug-interactions -table -substrates -inhibitors -and- 
inducers#table3 -2. 
In vitro orismilast is a competitive direct inhibitor of CYP2D6.  Concomitant use of orismilast 
with other drugs mainly metabolized by [CONTACT_70419]2D6 has not been studied clinically. 
Because of a potential increase of systemic exposure to medicinal products metabo lized by 
[CONTACT_097]2D6  when  concomitantly  administered  with orismilast  patients  should be monitored for AEs 
related to these medicinal products. Co -administration of drugs with a narrow therapeutic index 
such as tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, amitriptyli ne, imipramine, desipramine) or 
Type 1C antiarrhythmics (propafenone, flecainide and encainide) is prohibited (see Table 3 ).

 11. EFFICACY  ASSESSMENTS  
 
The Schedule  of Assessments  (Table  4) outlines  the efficacy  assessments  to be performed 
throughout the study and their timing. 
Assessors must be trained and certified by [CONTACT_174284]’s assessments.  The same  assessor  should perform all evaluations  within  the same 
patient throughout their stu dy participation.  
 
11.1. Investigator Assessments  
 
11.1.1.  Psoriasis  Area  and Severity  Index  
 
The PASI is a measure of psoriatic disease severity, taking into account quali tative lesion 
characteristics  (erythema,  induration, and desquamation) and percentage  of affected  skin surface 
area on defined anatomical regions. The PASI is a validated instrument that is  the most widely 
used tool for measurement of severity of psoriasis. 
Psoriasis Area Severity Index scores range from 0 to 72, with higher scores reflecting greater 
disease severity ( Fredriksson 1978 ). Erythema, induration/thickness, and scaling are scored on a 
scale of 0 (none) to 4 (very severe) on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper limbs, 
and lower  limbs.  Degree of involvement  on each of the 4 anatomic  regions is scored on a scale  of 
0 (no involvement) to 6 (90% to 100% involvement). The total qualitative score (sum of 
erythema, thickness, and scaling scores) is multiplied by [CONTACT_174285] a constant. The scores for each anatomic region are 
combined to yield the final PASI.  
 
11.1.2.  Investigator Global Assessment  
 
The IGA is a measure used by [CONTACT_174286]’s overall severi ty of disease. 
The static  version ( Langley  2015 ) is used in this trial for measurement  at a single point in time as 
indicated in the schedule of assessments. The Investigator will rate the sev erity of patient’s 
psoriasis on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe). 
 
11.1.3.  Scalp -specific  Investigator Global Assessment  
 
The ss-IGA assesses  lesions  on the scalp  for degree of redness, thickness,  and scaling  on a 5- 
point scale, with 0 indicating absence of disease and 4 indicating severe dise ase. 
 
11.1.4.  Physician’s  Global Assessment  of Fingernail  Psoriasis  
 
The PGA -F is used in this trial to evaluate abnormalities in the fingernails, and  the severity of 
these,  in patients  with nail psoriasis.  It is a simple  and reliable  clinician -rated  scale,  which  is easy 
to use in clinical practice and research. The scale rates the overall condition of th e fingernails  
and is based on a 5- point scale, with 0 indicating clear and 4 indicating severe.

Page  51 of 92  
 11.1.5.  Body Surface  Area  
 
The BSA assessment estimates the extent of disease or skin affected by [CONTACT_174287] d is 
expressed as a percentage  of total body surface. BSA  will be determined  by [CONTACT_174288] = 1% BSA rule.  
 
11.2. Patient -Reported  Outcomes  
 
11.2.1.  Psoriasis  Symptom Scale  
 
The PSS is a 4 -item patient -completed questionnaire ( Rentz et al 2017 ). It is patient relevant, its 
domains are reliable and valid, and it takes few minutes to complete. The PSS as sesses severity 
of pain, itching, redness, and burning during the past 24 hours using a 5-point severity  scale  from 
0 = none to 4 = very severe. 
 
11.2.2.  Scalp  Itch 
 
Scalp itch will be assessed by  [CONTACT_174289] 
[ADDRESS_203513] of skin disease on the patient’s QoL during the previous week. The 10 questions cover 
the following topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102]: symptoms, embarrassment, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_110149], clo thes, social and 
leisure, sport, work or study, close relationships, sex, and treatment. Each question is scored 
from 0 to 3 (“not at all,” “a little,” “a lot,” and “very much,” respectively), g iving a total score 
ranging from 0 to 30. A high score is indicative  of a poor QoL. DLQI  responses will be captured 
as outlined in the SoA.

 12. SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
 
Safety  assessments  (vital signs,  physical examinations,  ECG recording, AEs,  HADS,  C-SSRS, 
clinical laboratory results [routine hematology and biochemistry]) are to be performed at 
protocol- specified visits, as specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 4 ). 
 
12.1. Medical  History  
 
Medical history will be recorded at Screening. Investigato rs should document the occurrence, 
signs, and symptoms of the patient’s preexisting conditions, including all prior significant 
illnesses. Additional preexisting conditions present at the time when  informed consent is given, 
and up to the time of first dosing, are to be regarded as concomitant.  Medical  history will include 
alcohol consumption and smoking history, if applicable. 
Illnesses first occurring or detected during the study, and/or worsening of a concomitant illness 
during the study, are to be documented as  AEs on the eCRF in accordance with Section  12.7. All 
changes not present at Baseline or described in the past medica l history (last 6 months), and 
identified as clinically noteworthy, must be recorded as AEs.  
Additionally, demographic data will be collected  for all patients  and include  date of birth or age 
according to applicable regulations, sex, ethnicity, etc.  
 
12.2. Vital Signs  
 
Vital signs (body temperature, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], heart rate, and syst olic and diastolic blood 
pressure measurements)  will be evaluated  at the visits  indicated  in the Schedule of Assessments 
(Table 4 ). Using of tympanic/ear thermometer is recommended for body temperature. 
All vital signs will be measured  after the patient  has been  resting in a sitting  position for at least 
5 minutes. Blood pressure measurements  are to be taken in the  same arm for the duration of the 
study. Body weight (without shoes) will be recorded whenever vital signs are recorded; height 
(without shoes) will be recorded at Baseline only. A weight reduction of at least 5% from 
Baseline should be reported as a TEAE.  
Vital sign measurements will be repeated if clinically significant or machine /equipment errors 
occur. Out-of-range blood pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], or heart  rate measurements  will be repeated 
at the Investigator’s discretion. Any confirmed, clinically signif icant vital sign measurements 
must be recorded as AEs on the eCRF.

 12.3. Physical  Examination 
 
A complete  physical examination  (a check  of the head,  eyes, ears,  nose and thr oat; heart;  lungs; 
abdomen; skin; cervical and axillary lymph nodes; and neurological and m usculoskeletal 
systems)  will be performed at Screening (Visit  1) and Week  16. A limited  physical examination 
will be conducted  at Day 1 and Week  20 to verify continued patient  eligibility  and to Follow up 
regarding any change in medical history. Physical examinations will b e performed by a 
physician.  
Symptom-driven, limited  physical examinations  will be performed as clinically  indicated  at any 
study visit. Additionally, patients’ BMI, height, weight, as well as waist  and hip circumference 
will be measured at the visits indicated in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 4 ). 
 
12.4. Electrocardiogram  
 
A 12- lead,  resting  ECG will be obtained at the visits  indicate d in the Schedule of Assessments 
(Table 4 ). 
At Screening, the Investigator will examine the ECG traces for signs of cardia c disease that 
could exclude the patient  from the study. An assessment  of normal or abnormal will be recorded; 
if the ECG is considered  abnormal,  the abnormality  will be documented on the eCRF.  ECGs  will 
be repeated if clinically significant abnormalities are observed, or arti facts are present.  
 
12.5. Waist and Hip Circumferences  
 
The waist circumference should be measured at the top of the iliac crest, using a s tretch ‐ 
resistant  tape.  Hip circumference  should be measured  around the widest  portion of the buttocks, 
with the tape parallel to the floor.  
The individual should stand  with feet close  together,  arms  at the side, and body weight evenly 
distributed, and he or she should wear little clothing. The subject should be relaxed, and the 
measurements should  be taken at the end of a normal respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516].  
 
12.6. Laboratory Assessments  
 
Laboratory assessment  samples  (Table  5) are to be obtained at designated  visits  as detailed  in the 
Schedule of Assessments ( Table 4 ). Patients should be in fasting condition (no food or fluids 
other than water for 8 hours) before sample collection at Baseline and Week 16.

 12.7. The Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_174255] a PRO and comprises of 7 questions for anxiety and 7 questions for depression 
with each answer being graded from 0 to 3 with a higher score indicating a worse condition. For 
each group of questions, scores of less than 7 indicate noncases, whereas 8 to 10, 11 to 14, and 
15 to 21, indicate mild, moderate, or severe anxiety or depression, resp ectively. The HADS is 
one of the National Institute  for Health  and Care Excellence  recommended tools for diagnosis of 
depression and anxiety. 
Any patient wit h a score for depressive symptoms ≥[ADDRESS_203514]  (psychiatrist or clinical  psychologist) for further evaluation.  
After a mental health specialist evaluation, the final decision on restar ting or permanently 
discontinuing study treatment  will be at the discretion  of the Investigator  in consultation with the 
mental health specialist. These cases should be reported as an AESI. Refer to S ection 0. 
 
12.8. The Columbia -Suicide  Severity  Rating  Scale  
 
The C -SSRS, Investigator administered version, was designed to provide a prospective, 
standardized  measure of suicidality.  The scale  allows  clinicians  and researchers alike  to assess 
the severity and lethality of suicidal behaviors and ideations and can be  used to monitor 
treatment outcomes and establish suicide risk in a variety of research and clini cal settings.  
Requiring approximately 5 min for completion,  the C- SSRS  is administered  in the form of a 
clinical interview.  
This C-SSRS  is available  in 2 versions: [ADDRESS_203515] of the study referring to the time since the prior v isit. 
If at Screening  or Baseline  there  are “yes”  answers on items  [ADDRESS_203516] with a positive response on the C -SSRS (answers “yes” to questions 1-5) should be 
referred to a mental  health  specialist  (psychiatrist or clinical  psychologist) for further evaluation, 
and the study medication should be paused. After a mental health specialist evaluation , the final 
decision on restarting or permanently discontinuing study treatment w ill be at the discretion of 
the Investigator in consultation with the mental health specialist. These  cases  should be  reported 
as an AESI. Refer to Section 0. 
 
12.9. Adverse  Events  
 
AEs will be collected throughout  the study  as shown in the Schedule of Assessments  (Table  4). 
UNION  therapeutics  A/S 
Orismilast  UNI50001 -[ADDRESS_203517] 
(US Code of Federal Regulations [CFR] Title 21 Section 312.32[a]). Any abnormal finding that 
is deemed not clinically significant is not an AE.  
AEs include the onset of new illness  and the exacerbation  of preexisting  conditions. Any medical 
condition that is present at the time when the patient is screened should b e recorded on the 
medical history eCRF and not reported as an AE. However, if that condition  deteriorates or 
severity changes at any time during the study, it should be recorded as an AE. 
Any AEs that occur before dosing on study  Baseline  will be categorized  as pretreatment  events. 
TEAEs will be defined as those AEs that occur or worsen in severity  after initial dosing  and up 
to [ADDRESS_203518] dose of study drug. 
Patients  will be instructed  to report AEs at each study visit.  All AEs are to be followed up until 
resolution or a stable clinical endpoint is reached.  
Each  AE is to be documented  on the eCRF with referen ce to date of onset, duration, frequency, 
severity, relationship to study drug, action taken with study drug, treatment of event, and 
outcome. Furthermore, each AE is to be classified as being serious or nonserious. Changes in 
AEs and resolution dates are to be documented on the eCRF. 
For the purposes of this study, the period of observation for collection of AEs extends from the 
time the patient  gives informed consent until the Follow-up visit.  Follow up of the AE, even  after 
the date of therapy discontinuation, is required if the AE persists unti l the event resolves or 
stabilizes at a level acceptable to the Investigator.  
When changes in the intensity of an AE occur more frequently than once a day, the maxi mum 
intensity  for the event should be noted. If the intensity  category changes  over a number of days, 
then those changes should be recorded separately (with distinct onset dates ).

GRADE  1: Mild,  asymptomatic  or mild symptoms; clinical  or diagnostic observations only; intervention not 
indicated.  
GRADE  2: Moderate;  minimal,  local  or noninvasive intervention indicated;  limiting  age-appropriate instrumental  
ADL.  
GRADE  3: Severe  or medically  significant but not immediately  life threatening;  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_174256];  disabling; limiting  self-care ADL.

Table 7. Classification of Adverse  Events by [CONTACT_174293] : This category  applies  to those AEs that are clearly  and incontrovertibly due to extraneous  causes 
(disease, environment, etc).  
UNLIKELY : This category applies to those AEs that are judged to be unrelated to the test drug but f or which no 
extraneous cause may  be found. An AE may  be considered  unlikely to be related  to study drug if or when  it meets 
2 of the following criteria: (1) it does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence  from administration of the test 
drug; (2) it could readily have been produced by [CONTACT_102]’s clinical state, environme ntal or toxic factors, or 
other modes of therapy administered to the patient; (3) it does not follow a known pattern of  response to the test 
drug; or (4) it does not reappear or worsen when the drug is readministered.  
POSSIBLY : This category applies to those AEs for which a connection with the test drug administ ration appears 
unlikely but cannot be ruled  out with certainty.  An AE may  be considered  possibly related if  or when  it meets  2 of 
the following criteria: (1) it follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug; (2) it could 
not readily have been produced by [CONTACT_102]’s clinical state, environmental or toxic f actors, or other modes of 
therapy administered to the patient; or (3) it follows a known pattern of respons e to the test drug.  
PROBABLY : This category applies to those AEs that the Investigator feels with a high degree of c ertainty are 
related  to the test drug. An AE may  be considered  probably related  if or when  it meets  3 of the following criteria: 
(1) it follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug; (2)  it could not be reasonably 
explained by [CONTACT_11564]’s clinical state, environme ntal or toxic factors, or other 
modes of therapy  administered  to the patient;  (3) it disappears  or decreases  on cessation  or reduction in dose (note 
that there are exceptions when an AE does not disappear upon discontinuation of the drug, yet drug -relatedness 
clearly exists; for example, as in bone marro w depression, fixed drug eruptions, or tardive dyskinesia); or (4) it 
follows a known pattern of response to the test drug.  
DEFINITELY : This category  applies to those AEs that the Investigator feels are incontrovertibly  related to test 
drug. An AE may  be assigned an  attribution  of definitely  related  if or when  it meets  all of the following  criteria:  
(1) it follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug; (2)  it could not be reasonably 
explained by [CONTACT_174294]’s clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or other 
modes of therapy  administered  to the patient;  (3) it disappears  or decreases  on cessation  or reduction in dose and 
recurs with  re-exposure to drug  (if rechallenge  occurs);  and (4)  it follows a known pattern of  response to the  test 
drug.

12.9.2.  Adverse  Events of Special  Interest  
 
An AESI (serious or non-serious) is one of scientific and medical concern, for which ongoing 
monitoring and rapid communication by [CONTACT_174295]. 
AESIs  must  be reported within  [ADDRESS_203519] igator  becomes  aware 
of the event,  following SAE  reporting procedures (Section  12.9.4 ). Such an event might require  
UNION  therapeutics  A/S 
Orismilast  UNI50001 -203

Page  58 of 92  
 further investigation  in order to characterize  and understand it. Depending on the nature of the 
event, rapid communication by [CONTACT_50459] (eg, regulators) might also be 
warranted.  
In this trial, the  following AEs are to be considered AESIs:  
• Any AE of occurrence of suicidal  ideation  or behavior, including a positive  response to 
question 1 to 5 of C- SSRS  
• A depression assessed  as moderate or worse  by [CONTACT_29517] a score ≥15 in the 
HADS  score  
• Any grade 3 or higher psychiatric  condition  
• Any weight loss >5%  compared  to Baseline,  and/or  
• Any of the following GI TEAEs:  vomiting,  diarrhea with an increase  of at least four 
stools per day over Baseline (Grade 2 CTCAE) for at least [ADDRESS_203520] medical  occurrence, in the view  of either  the Investigator  or Sponsor, 
that: 
• results  in death,  
• is life threatening,  
• results  in inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_707],  
• results  in persistent  or significant disability/incapacity,  and/or  
• is a congenital anomaly/birth  defect  
• results  from overdose  
Other imp ortant medical events  that may  not be immediately  life threatening  or result in death or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], based upon appropriate medical judgment, are considered SAEs if they are 
thought to jeopardize  the patient  and/or require medical  or surgical intervention  to prevent one of 
the outcomes defining an SAE. SAEs are critically important for the identi fication of significant 
safety problems; therefore, it is important to take into account bot h the Investigator’s and the 
Sponsor’s assessment. If either the Sponsor or the Investigator believes that an event is se rious, 
the ev ent must be considered serious and evaluated by [CONTACT_80220]. 
 
12.9.4.  Serious  Adverse  Event Reporting  
 
An SAE occurring from the time informed consent is obtained, during the study, or within [ADDRESS_203521] be reported immediately, and under no circu mstances later than  
UNION  therapeutics  A/S 
Orismilast  UNI50001 -203 
Version  3.0

Page  59 of 92  
 24 hours after the Investigator has become aware  of the event.  Notification  can be made  using 
the dedicated fax line or email for  Safety and Pharmacovigilance group: 
• Safety  and Pharmacovigilance  
• Safety  and Pharmacovigilance email  address:  
 
If the Investigator contacts the  Safety  and Pharmacovigilance group by [CONTACT_756], 
then a written re port must follow within [ADDRESS_203522] report al l additional Follow -up 
evaluations to  Safety  and Pharmacovigilance  group within  24 hours of becoming 
aware of the additional information or as soon as is practicable. All SAEs wi ll be followed up 
until the Investigator and Sponsor agree the event is satisfactoril y resolved. 
Any SAE that is not resolved by [CONTACT_80221]’s 
participation in the study is to be followed up until it either resolves , stabilizes, returns to 
Baseline  values  (if a Baseline  value is available),  or is shown to not be attributable  to the study 
drug or procedures. 
 
12.9.5.  Suspected  Unexpected  Serious  Adverse  Reactions  
 
AEs that meet all of the following criteria will be classified as suspected  unexpected serious 
adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs)  and reported to the appropriate regulatory authorities  in accordance 
with applicable regulatory requirements for expedited reporting: 
• serious 
• unexpected (ie, the event  is not consistent with  the safety  information in the 
Investigator’s Brochure)  
• there is at least a reasonable  possibility  that there is a causal  relationship  between  the event 
and the study treatment  
The Investigator will assess whether or not an event is causally related to stud y treatment. 
will consider the Investigator’s assessment  and determine  whether or not the 
event meets  the criteria  for being reportable as a 7-day or 15-day safety  report. S[LOCATION_003]Rs  that are 
fatal, or life threatening must be reported to the regulatory authorities and the IEC/IRB (where

 required) within 7 days after the /UNION  therapeutics  A/S has first knowledge of 
them, with a Follow -up report (when applicable) submitted within a further [ADDRESS_203523]  be reported to the relevant regulatory authorities  and the IEC/IRBs within  
15 calendar  days after the /UNION  therapeutics  A/S first has knowledge of them.  
The Sponsor is responsible for reporting S[LOCATION_003]Rs, and any other events required to be reported 
in an expedited  manner  to the regulatory  authorities  and for informing investigators of reportable 
events, in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements within speci fic timeframes.  
Investigators will notify the relevant IRB/IEC of reportable events  within  the applicable 
timeframes.  
 
12.9.6.  Pregnancy  
 
WOCBP must have a negative serum pregnanc y test at Screening and are required to use one of 
the highly effective contraception methods (Inclusion Criterion 7). Women on hormone 
replacement  therapy, and whose menopausal  status  is in doubt, will be required to use one of the 
highly effective contraception methods. Highly effective contraceptio n is defined as having a 
failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently  and correctly and, when applicable, 
in accordance with the product label.  
Women of nonreproductive potential are defined as those with surgical sterilization 
(hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656]) and  those in a 
postmenopausal status defined as cessation of menses for at least [ADDRESS_203524] 24 
months without an alternative medical cause.  
After administration of study drug, any known cases of pregnancy in female patients will be 
reported until the patient completes  or withdraws from the study. The pregnancy will be reported 
immediately by [CONTACT_29658]/emailing a completed pregnancy report to  Safety and 
Pharmacovigilance within [ADDRESS_203525] pos sible time but not 
more than 30 days after completion of the pregnancy. The Investigator should notify 
and Pharmacovigilance of the pregnancy outcome by [CONTACT_17258] a Follow-up pregnancy 
report. If the outcome of the pregnancy involved spontaneous or therapeutic abortion (any 
congenital anomaly detected in an aborted fetus is to be documented), stillbir th, neonatal death, 
or congenital anomaly, the Inv estigator will report the event by [CONTACT_29658]/emailing a completed 
pregnancy report form to and Pharmacovigilance within [ADDRESS_203526]  only be submitted  after obtaining  written  consent from the pregnant partner. The

(Table  4) before dose of the study drug. The actual date  and time of each blood sample  collection 
will be recorded. 
Blood sampling for measuring trough levels: The blood collection for PK analysis should 
preferably be conducted approximately hours after the last study drug administration. It is 
recommended  to have  date and time of patient’s  last drug intake before PK sampling  recorded in 
patient’s source and in the eCRF as well.  
Blood sampling  for calculation  of PK profiles: In addition  to the sample  collected  for measuring 
trough levels, patients will be offered optional participation in spec ific blood samp ling for 
calculation of PK profiles. This additional procedure is voluntary for patients and patient’s 
consent will be obtained before collection of the blood samples. For PK profiling, 
additional blood samples will be collected during each visit at  a nd  . The patient 
will be instructed to take the next dose of the study drug in the clinic and  blood samples will be 
taken at the following timepoints:  (estimated C max),    after 
intake of the study drug, as shown in Figure 2 . An additional optional  blood sample will 
be collected if  possible for the patient. The actual date and time of  the study drug administration 
in the clinic and each blood sample collection will be recorded.

 15. STATISTICAL  ANALYSIS  
 
A statistical analysis plan will be prepared after the protocol is approved. Th is document will 
provide further details  regarding the definition  of analysis  variables  and analysis  methodology to 
address all study objectives. The statistical analysis plan will serve as a compliment  to the 
protocol and supersedes it in case of differences.  
The statistical evaluation will be performed using SAS® software version 9.4 or higher 
(SAS Institute,  Cary, NC). All data will be listed,  and summary tables  will be provided. 
Summary  statistics will  be presented by [CONTACT_1570]. For continuous  variables,  data will be 
summarized  with the number of patients  (N), mean,  standard deviation, median,  minimum,  and 
maximum  by [CONTACT_2948]. For categorical  variables,  data will be tabulated  with the number 
and proportion of patients for each category by [CONTACT_1570]. 
 
15.1. Determination of Sample  Size 
 
Approximately 200 patients will be enrolled to ensure approximately 50 patients per arm. This 
sample  size is based on assumptions that the  percentage  change from Baseline in PASI  is -32.2% 
and -50.9% for placebo and each orismilast dose group, respectively, and the standard deviation 
is 33%. Using  a 2-sided  2-sample  t-test, 50 patients  in each treatment  arm can achieve  a power of 
80% at the significance level of 5%.  
 
15.2. Analysis  Popul ations 
 
Intent -to-Treat Population  
The intent -to-treat (ITT) population will include  all randomized patients  who receive  at least 1 
dose of study drug. The treatment group assignment will be designated according to initial 
randomization. The ITT population will serve as the basis for the analysis of efficacy.  
Per-Protocol Population  
The Per-protocol (PP) population includes  all randomized patients  who receive  at least [ADDRESS_203529] 1 dose of study 
drug. The treatment  group assignment  in this population will be defined  by [CONTACT_174296]. This population will be used for the analysis of safety.  
UNION  therapeutics  A/S 
Orismilast  UNI50001 -[ADDRESS_203530] done for the continuous variable,  then determine  the category 
using the imputed values. Analyses will be repeated on the PP Population for primary and 
secondary endpoints. 
When  appropriate, the raw parameter,  its change from Baseline,  and percentage  change from 
Baseline will be summarized.  
 
15.3.1.  Analysis  of Primary  Efficacy Endpoint  
 
The primary endpoint, percentage change from Baseline to Week 16 in PASI, will  be analyzed 
using analysis  of covariance with treatment  group as factor  and Baseline PASI  as covariate.  As a 
supportive analysis, a mixed model for repeated measure (MMRM) will be performed with 
treatment group, visit and treatment -by-visit interaction as factors and Baseline PASI score by - 
visit interaction as a covariates.  
Each active treatment dose will be compared with placebo. No adjustment for mul tiplicity will 
be made  and the 0.[ADDRESS_203531] square means and the 95% confidence interval of the difference between each acti ve 
treatment and placebo will be calculated. The primary analysis set will be the ITT  Analysis 
Population with multiple imputation approach to handle missing v alues. The same analyses will 
be repeated for Weeks 20, 12, 8 and 4. 
 
15.3.2.  Analysis  of Secondary  Efficacy Endpoints  
 
For continuous secondary efficacy  endpoints including change from Baseline  in PASI,  total PSS, 
each individual item of the PSS, BSA and DLQI, a MMRM will be performed si milar to the 
supportive MMRM for the primary endpoint. 
The key secondary efficacy endpoints and other binary secondary efficacy endpoints (IGA 
success,  PASI50, PASI75, PASI90) will be analyzed  using the Mantel -Haenszel  (MH)  test, 
comparing each active treatment group to placebo in the ITT Analysis set.  
For categorical endpoints, the MH procedure, with ridit scores, will be us ed; this test is the same 
as the nonparametric Wilcoxon test and enhances the analysis when the paramet er is not 
normally distributed. Graphics will be added to facilitate interpretat ion. IGA scores/full scale 
will be analyzed  using the MH test and the row mean  score statistics  and the ridit transformation.

 The above endpoints (PASI changes and percentage changes, IGA success, PASI50, PASI75, 
PASI90) and the percentage change of BSA will be presented graphically over time from 
Baseline to Week 20. In addition, shift tables will be provided between Bas eline and each visit 
for the IGA distribution. The PASI  percentage  changes  from Baseline  will be plotted  to identify 
where the best separation between treatments occur.  
 
15.3.3.  Analysis  of Exploratory Endpoints  
 
All exploratory endpoints including  change from Baseline  in PGA -F, ss-IGA,  scalp  itch NRS,  
, risk factors, and at Week  16 will be summarized 
descriptively in the ITT Population or a subgroup. 
 
15.4. Safety Analysis  
 
All safety analyses will be conducted using the Safety Analysis Population . AE data will be 
presented and tabulated according to Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA ) 
classification.  Reported AEs will be summarized  by [CONTACT_174297], 
as well as by [CONTACT_88462] (PT), SOC, PT, and severity, and SOC, PT, and 
relationship to study drug. 
Laboratory (chemistry and hematology) parameters and vital signs will  be tabulated by [CONTACT_174298].  The value at each visit,  as well as the change from 
Baseline, will be presented.  
 
15.5. Pharmacokinetic  Analysis  
 
The plasma  levels  of the drug and its metabolites  will be summarized  descriptively  by [CONTACT_80224].

All patient data relating to the study will be recorded on printed eCRF un less transmitted to the 
sponsor or designee electronically (eg, laboratory data). The Investigator is responsible for 
verifying that data entries are accurate and correct by [CONTACT_174300]. Access  to the electronic  data capture  system will  be restricted  and user will only  be able to 
access the system via authorized individual accounts. Appropriate traini ng will be completed 
with the Investigator and all authorized  study site personnel prior to the study being initiated  and 
any data being entered into the eCRF.  
A comprehensive Data Management Plan will be written outlining  the standard operating 
procedures, internal/external  security  safeguards, system  and change controls and training 
procedures and will be filed in the Sponsor’s trial master file.  
The Investigator  must  permit  study- related  monitoring, audits, IRB/IEC review, and regulatory 
agency inspections and provide direct access to source data documents.  
Protocol deviations  from inclusion/exclusion  criteria,  concomitant  medication  restrictions  and 
from any other protocol requirements that could result in significant risk t o the patient and/or 
affect the outcome of the study will be collected. Additionally, nonadheren ce to the study 
procedures or schedule as defined by [CONTACT_174301] a missed procedure or an out-of- 
window study visit will be documented as protocol deviations.  
Monitoring details  describing  strategy  (eg, risk-based  initiatives  in operations and quality  such as 
Risk Management and Mitigation Strategies and Analytical Risk -Based Monitoring), methods, 
responsibilities and requirements, including handling of noncompliance issues and monitoring 
techniques (central, remote, or on -site monitoring) are provided in the Monitoring Plan. 
The sponsor or designee is responsible for the data management  of this study including quality 
checking of the data prior to data base closure.

 Appendix  2. Psoriasis  Area  and Severity  Index  (PASI)  
 
The PASI  was developed in 1978 by [CONTACT_174305]. The PASI combines assessments of 4 body areas: the head and neck (H), the upper 
limbs  (UL), the trunk (T) and the lower  limbs  (LL). The percentage  of skin affected  by [CONTACT_174306] a numerical score (A) representing the proportion involved: 1 (0–9%), 2 
(10–29%), 3 (30–49%), 4 (50–69%), 5 (70–89%) or 6 (90–100%). Within each area (H, UL, T, 
LL) the severity of 3 plaque signs – erythema (E), thickness/induration (I) and 
desquamation/scaling (D) – is assessed on a 5 -point scale: 0 (none), 1 (mild), 2 (moderate), 3 
(severe) or 4 (very severe). The final PASI  score ranges from 0 to 72, and is calculated using the 
following formula: PASI  = 0.1 (E H+IH+H H) A H + 0.2 (E UL+IUL+H UL) A UL + + 0.3 (ET+IT+H T) A T 
+ 0.4 (E LL+ILL+H LL) A LL

The body surface area  (BSA) assessment  estimates  the extent  of disease  or skin involvement 
with respect  to atopic dermatitis  (AD)  and is expressed as a percentage  of total body surface.  
Determine  BSA  using the patient’s  palm  = 1% BSA rule. 
The patient’s  palm  is measured  from the wrist  to the proximal interphalangeal and thumb.  
Estimate  the number of palms  it takes  to cover the affected  AD area.  Add up the number of 
palms to give a total estimate of the area covered in AD.  
Additional rules:  
1. When  many  small  lesions  are present,  try to put several  together  to make  one patient 
palm.  
2. Only  include the edge of current lesions,  not areas  that have  cleared.  
3. Double check  to see if area derived matches  eyeball method.

SUICIDAL  BEHAVIOR  
(Check  all that apply, so long as these  are separate  events;  must  ask about all types)  Since  Last  Visit  
Actual  Attempt:  
A potentially self -injurious act committed with at least some wish to die, as a result 
of act. Behavior was in part thought of as method to kill oneself. Intent does not  
have to be 100%. If there is any intent/desire to die associated with the act, then it  
can be considered  an actual  suicide attempt. There  does not have  to be any injury  or 
harm , just the potential for injury or harm. If person pulls trigger while gun is in 
mouth, but gun is broken so no injury results, this is considered an attempt.  
Inferring Intent: Even if an individual denies intent/wish to die, it may be inferr ed 
clinically  from  the behavior or circumstances.  For example, a  highly lethal  act that is 
clearly  not an accident  so no other intent,  but suicide can be inferred  (e.g.,  gunshot to 
head, jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_24608] a high floor/story). Also, if someone denies intent to 
die, but they thought that what they did could be lethal, intent may be inferred.  
Have  you made a suicide  attempt?  
Have  you done anything  to harm  yourself?  
Have  you done anything  dangerous where  you could  have  died?  
What  did you do? 
Did you as a way to end your  life? 
Did you want to die (even a little) when you   ? 
Were  you trying  to end your  life when  you  ? 
Or did you think  it was possible you could  have  died from  ? 
Or did you do it purely  for other  reasons  / without  ANY  intention  of killing  yourself 
(like to relieve stress, feel better,  
get sympathy,  or get something  else to happen)? (Self-Injurious Behavior without

Interrupted  Attempt:  
When the person is interrupted (by [CONTACT_24662]) from starting the 
potentially self -injurious act (if not for that, actual attempt would have occurred). 
Overdose: Person  has pi[INVESTIGATOR_174264]. Once  they ingest 
any pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], this becomes an attempt rather than an interrupted attempt. Shooting: 
Person has gun pointed toward self, gun is taken away by [CONTACT_24663], or is

Aborted  or Self-Interrupted  Attempt:  
When person begins to take steps toward making a suicide attempt but stops

him/herself, instead of being stopped by [CONTACT_6615].

somewhat responsive; second -degree burns; bleeding of major vessel).  
3. Moderately  severe  physical damage;  medical  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_174265] (eg, comatose with reflexes intact; third -degree burns less than 
20% of body; extensive blood loss but can recover; major fractures).  
4. Severe physical damage; medical hospi[INVESTIGATOR_24611] (eg, 
comatose  without reflexes;  third -degree  burns over 20% of body; extensive blood

Potential Lethality:  Only  Answer  if Actual  Lethality  = 0 
Likely lethality of actual attempt if no medical damage (the following examples, 
while having no actual medical damage, had potential for very serious lethality: put 
gun in mouth and pulled the trigger but gun fails to fire so no medical  damage;  laying 
on train tracks with oncoming train but pulled away before run over).

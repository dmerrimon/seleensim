1. RATIONALE  
 
Diabetes mellitus and its sequelae are a major and growing public health problem. The 
prevalence of diabetes worldwide is 194 million persons, or 5.1% of the population, and is 
projected to increase to 333 million, or 6.3% of the population, by 2025 (1). The number of 
persons with impaired glucose tolerance is estimated to increase as well. Diabetes is related to 
obesity, inactivity, population growth, and aging. In addition, diabetes is recognized as a group 
of metabolic  disorders characterized by [CONTACT_564164], impaired effectiveness of insulin action, or both (2).  
 
Lifestyle strategies that include dietary modification, such as consumption of a plant -based diet, 
are wel l recognized in disease prevention and may improve type 2 diabetes (3,4) . Various 
components of a plant -based diet may contribute to its beneficial health effects, but there has been 
keen interest in the possibility that plant polyphenols may have a role. Blueberries are dietary 
sourc es of polyphenols, specifically anthocyanins. Anthocyanins consist of approximately 35 – 
74% of total phenolic compounds in blueberries, followed by [CONTACT_564165], 
flavonols, and flavanols (5).   
 
There is encouraging pre -clinical evidence that berries may improve glucose management. 
Bilberry extract ameliorat ed hyperglycemia and insulin sensitivity in type 2 diabetic mice (6).  
Blueberry extract also reduced plasma glucose 6 h after ingestion in mice (7). Blueberry 
polyphenols stabilized in soybean flour reduced glucose intolerance in mice and decreased glucose 
production in rat hepatocytes (8). Further, lowbush blueberry extracts were found to induce beta -
cell proliferation in vitro (9). 
 
Several promising human studies have also been conducted.  In healthy males, a meal with 
lingonberry powder plus yogurt produced an equivalent post -prandial glucose  response as a meal 
with only yogurt, despi[INVESTIGATOR_564161] 
(10). In another study, various berries, including strawberries, bilberries, lingonberries, and 
chokeberries, reduced insulin response after  a meal containing berries plus bread (11).  In the same 
study, strawberries and mixed berries also reduced glucose response after the berry -bread meal 
(11). In a third study, a mix of bilberries, blackcurrants, cranberries, and strawberries decreased 
the post -prandial glucose response in healthy adults (12). 
  
More broadly, to date there are few clinical trials evaluating the beneficial health effects of 
bluebe rries in populations with type [ADDRESS_741089] early biomarkers of 
cardiovascular disease and diabetes, such as altering blood pressure, insulin sens itivity and 
oxidative stress (13-16). A systematic review has also concluded that there is a lack of clinical 
trials evaluating blueberry consumption in humans with type 2 diabetes (17).

males with type 2 diabete s?  
 
3.   STUDY DESIGN:  
 
Sixty males (BMI >25 kg/m2) with type 2 diabetes will be recruited to enroll in a placebo -
controlled, double -blind, randomized parallel arm study with 2 treatment groups for a total of 8 
weeks.  
 
4.  METHODS:  
 
A. Procedures  
 
Treatment .  Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups ; either 1) 22 g 
of a control blueberry placebo treatment (matched in energy and carbohydrate content to the 
blueberry treatment ; ingredients are maltodextrin, fructose, artificial blueberry flavoring and 
coloring, citric acid and silica dioxide ) along with their free -living diet per day, 2) 22 g of a freeze -
dried whole blueberry powder treatment along with their free -living diet per day. One cup of fresh 
blueberries is equivalent to approximately 22 g of freeze -dried whole blueberry powder. This  
amount was chosen as it is a reasonable amount of fruit for subjects with type 2 diabetes to 
consume. Subjects will be asked to consume 11 g of freeze dried blueberry powder or placebo, 
reconstituted with 240 ml water, with their morning and evening meals  for 8 weeks. Participants 
will be counseled by a registered dietitian as to how the treatment is to be consumed, and 
compliance will be monitored by a daily questionnaire. In addition, the number of used and unused 
treatment packets will be tracked. Subje cts will receive a 4 week supply of these products during 
a visit to the Stratton VA Medical Center.  Treatments will be blinded to the study investigators 
and subjects (e.g., investigators and subjects will not know the composition of the treatments until  
after the study is complete).  The US Highbush Blueberry Council will hold the code to the study 
treatments.  
 
Subjects will be responsible for their own meals and will continue to follow their typi[INVESTIGATOR_564162] (food consumption will be moni tored periodically as described below).  
 
General Physiological Variables.  Body weight will be determined following an [ADDRESS_741091]’s height 
without shoes will be measured to the nearest 0.[ADDRESS_741092] /hip circumference  will be obtained at baseline, at [ADDRESS_741093] protocol. Subjects will be taken to a quiet 
room with subdued lighting.  The appropriate size cuff will be at tached to the upper right arm 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.  Blood pressure will be measured three times with a 
Dinamap Compact Blood Pressure Monitor, which will be programmed to take an initial reading 
and then a reading after [ADDRESS_741094] 30 minutes prior to the measurement 
and will be advised to empty their bladder prior to the measurement.  Blood pressure  will be 
obtained at baseline, at 4 weeks, then after 8 weeks of the study .  Each measure requires 20 minutes 
(20 minutes x 3) = [ADDRESS_741095].  A 
total of 50 ml of blood will be collected. Plasma and serum will be collected then analyzed.  Plasma 
and serum will be used for analysis of health indices  and biomarkers of cardiovascular disease and 
diabetes  (cardiometabolic parameters) .  Blood will be analyzed for a complete metabolic panel, 
blood lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805] , lipoproteins and inflammation  (triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL 
cholesterol , and high sensitivity CRP ) along with markers of glucoregulatory mechanisms 
(hemo globin A1C, fructosamine, insulin, and glucose ).  Each blood draw requires 20 minutes, (20 
minutes x 3) = [ADDRESS_741096] 10 ml .  Urine will be collected in plastic containers 
and will be stored on ice during collection and until samples can be delivered to the laboratory .   
Each urine collection requires 5 minutes , (5 minutes x 2) = 10 minutes  for the entire study.  Urine 
will be analyzed for urine microalbumin to creatinine ratio . 
 
Questionnaires.  Participants  will be asked to complete a daily questionnaire regarding th eir 
general health; if they consumed any over the counter or prescription medications and their general 
feeling of well-being .  
 
 Study Application (administered once) – 30 minutes - to determine eligibility

C. Data management  
 
Health  and other personal information given in participation of this research is confidential.  All 
information will be kept in strictest confidence.  Each subject will be assigned a code number for the 
study.  This number will be assigned at the initial visit a nd will be used to identify samples and data.  
Names or other identifiers will only be used on screening documents or other procedures where person -
to-person communication is required.  Subjects will not be personally identified in any of the reports 
of research.  Subjects, and their physicians with written subject consent, will have access to subjects’ 
records.  Records will be reviewed with each subject with one of the investigators, if requested, to 
provide an explanation of the findings.  Whenever resea rch in which subjects have participated is 
published, they will be given a copy of the report, if requested.  All biologic samples will be labeled 
only with ID numbers.  All data will be de -identified and stored under ID numbers  to diminish risk of

Data from the study will be stored indefinitely or according to Records Control Schedule  
Requirements. In addition, any event of loss of data, breach of confidentiality or serious adverse event 
will be reported to the Information Security Office and Privacy Officer within [ADDRESS_741102] the confidentiality of the information provided insofar as it is 
legally possible.  
 
Quality control of data management will incorporate software routines that identify and flag 
missing and out -of-range values, double entry of dat a into the computer, and checking of typed 
data for a random subset.  
 
D. Data analysis and sample size justification  
 
Data analysis:   
 
The data will be analyzed using a mixed model in order to partition variance from random and 
fixed effects.  The model will account for age, BMI and the significance for other terms will be 
tested to determine if they are to remain in the model.  Some te rms may be used as covariates. 
Split -plot and split -split plot analysis will be used to partition variances from measurem ents for 
which there are repeated measures.  Contrasts statements or appropriate multiple comparisons of 
means will be completed using least -square means.  
 
Sample size:   
 
Sixty males with type [ADDRESS_741103] deviation from a previous study conducted by [CONTACT_564166] (13), which showed 
that 50 g of freeze -dried blueberry powder lowered systolic and diastolic blood pressure. A sample 
size calculation was estimated for a 1 -factor ANOVA for a parallel -arm study with > 80% power 
to detect a significant difference. Twenty -four participants per group are needed, and 30 per group 
are determined based on a 20% drop out rate.   
 
 
5.  RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT:  
 
This study has a minimal level of risk. Blood collection may cause a small amount of pain when the 
needle is inserted into the vein.  Sometimes, after blood is taken, a small bruise can appear at the site. 
This bruise, however, does not cause any long -term problems.  Aside from the discomfort of the needle 
puncture, there is nothing in this procedure that can cause any problem. There is also a remote chance 
of fainting, light -headedness, or infection.  Blood will be drawn from a forearm vein by a trained 
Page [ADDRESS_741104] his blood 
drawn while reclining in a suitable chair ( during subject selection, participants are asked if they have 
or had a history of fainting while giving blood).  
 
6. STUDY POPLUATION – GENDER/ETHNIC INCLUSION:  
 
Rationale for research subject selection – The population from which participants  will be recruited 
consists of approximately 5000  individuals receiving care for type 2 diabetes living within 
commuting distance of the study site at the Stratton VA Medical Center , Albany , NY .

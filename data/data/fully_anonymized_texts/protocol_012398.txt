Protocol Date:  06-08-[ADDRESS_873316] common 
cause of cancer death in the [LOCATION_002], with approximately 150,000 new cases and 57,000 
deaths per year. About 1 in 18 individuals will develop colorectal cancer over their lifetime and 
40% will die within 5 years of diagnosis, mainly due to diagnosis at a late stage. Therefore, 
development of primary preventive strategies for colorectal cancer is very critical. Colorectal 
cancer is believed to arise in the overwhelming majority of cases from adenomatous polyps via 
the well -established adenoma -carcinoma sequence . Furthermore, 41% of patients presenting 
an initial hyperplastic polyp subsequently developed adenomatous polyps. G rowing evidence 
has highlighted a potentially important role in colorectal carcinogenesis of the serrated pathway 
comprising hyperplastic polyps and serrated adenomas. Thus, investigation of preventive 
strategies for colorectal adenoma will provide primary preventive strategies for colorectal 
cancer.  
Thus far, endoscopy, particularly colonoscopy, has been regarded as the most effective 
preventive strategy to reduce both incidence of colorectal cancer and mortality due to colorectal 
cancer. In recent years, both incidence and mortality of colorectal cancer in the U.S. has 
decreased, possibly because of the rapi[INVESTIGATOR_651166]. However, colorectal cancer still has one of the highest rates of incidence and 
mortality in the U.S.  One possible explanation is that the routine screening rate is still not 
sufficiently high. On the other hand, a very recent population -based report found that 
colonoscopy is associated with reduced deaths from the left side of the colon, but not the right. 
It was also found, in as many as 24% of cases, snare polypectomy of ex ophytic lesions was 
unable to inhibit progression to carcinoma. Consistent with several large studies conducted in 
other Western countries, very recently, using an elective colonoscopy technique not used in 
regular clinical practice, a large US prevalence study with 1,819 patients found an overall 
prevalence rate of 9.35% for flat or depressed adenoma which are frequently missed in 
standard of care colonoscopy. The flat or depressed lesions were about [ADDRESS_873317] generated disappointing results on the association 
between fiber or vegetables and colorectal cancer, and recent intervention trials also did not 
support an association of dietary intake of vitamin C and E and carotenoids with col orectal 
adenoma. Very recently, the Physicians' Health Study II randomized controlled trial found 
individual supplements of 400 IU of vitamin E every other day and/or [ADDRESS_873318] of an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Calcium, vitamin D and folate are the three 
other remaining promising protective agents with convincing evidence in colorectal cancer. 
Unfortunately, a large randomized clinical trial (Women's Health Initiative, WHI) found that 
calcium plus vitamin D supplementation for seven years had no effect on  the incidence of 
colorectal cancer. Very recently, the first clinical trial of folic acid found the intervention does not 
reduce recurrent colorectal adenoma risk. Moreover, folic acid supplementation might increase

was reported in a clinical trial conducted in China with supplementation in the Dietary Reference 
Intake (DRI) range. In a very recent commentary in JNCI , internationally renowned investigators 
in the field commented that growing evidence suggests that some nutrients or metals, including 
calcium, showed protective effects at normal range, but showed opposite effects at a high dose.  
Before the initiation of new large -scale intervention trials, it is essential to “rethink” the 
mechanisms, study design and dose -range of supplementation by [CONTACT_651232] -scale 
studies to understand nutrient -nutrient and gene -nutrient interactions, particularly in early 
tumorigenesis. Our proposed study is designed in such a manner to address many of the issues 
raised in the commentary, such as using biomarkers related to earlier tumorigenesis, 
supplementation of magnesium will not exceed the DRI for supplemental magnesium intake by 
[CONTACT_726] 40 mg, supplementation dosage according to baseline dietary intake, nutrient -nutrient 
interaction (calcium/magnesium balance), and gene -nutrient interaction. Our findings may 
eventually lead to personalized strategies in the prevention of colorectal cancer and, perhaps, 
many other cancers or chronic diseases which are both linked to magnesium deficiency and 
common in Western societies.  
 
2.[ADDRESS_873320] linked a high intake of magnesium to a significantly reduced risk of colorectal 
cancer. Nevertheless, one recent cohort study has not found such an association. We reported 
recently in the Tennessee Colorectal Polyp Study (TCPS ; P50CA95103) that intake of 
magnesium is related to a significantly reduced risk of adenoma and hyperplastic polyps. This 
inverse association primarily appeared among those with a low ratio of calcium to magnesium 
intake (Ca/Mg intake ratio). We have found similar results for intake of calcium. Very recently, 
we have confirmed these novel findings in a large clinical trial study (unpublished results). 
Furthermore, in the TCPS, w e found that the Ca/Mg intake ratio significantly interacted with the 
common Thr1482Ile polymorphism (rs8042919, G →A) of the TRPM7  gene, in relation to both 
adenoma s and hyperplastic polyps . The TRPM7  gene is involved in calcium and magnesium 
re(absorption) and homeostasis. We also found the associations between intakes of calcium or 
magnesium and risk of colorectal adenoma and hyperplastic polyps may differ by [CONTACT_651233]1482Ile 
polymorphism . Therefore, our findings may partially explain the inconsistency in previous 
studies of the association of calcium and magnesium with risk of colorectal cancer or adenoma.  
To follow -up on these novel and promising findings, we propose to conduct an intervention trial 
using biomarkers linked to colorectal carcinogenesis. In the proposed study, we will enroll  288 
colorectal adenoma or/and hyperplastic polyp patients , polyps free participants but being at high 
risk of colorectal polpys or cancer from the TCPS study , the TIARS,  Vanderbilt University 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], or from other resources, who consume a high dietary Ca/Mg intake ratio  and whose 
daily calcium consumption is equal to or greater than 700 mg. Furthermore, these participants 
will be chosen from among those for whom Thr1482Ile polymorphism (G →A) genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_651167]. We will enroll  [ADDRESS_873321] one variant A allele (i.e. either GA or AA genotype) , 10 of whom 
carry the AA genotype.    
 
 
Protocol Version  #: 34.0  6 
Protocol Date:  06-08-2022 The primary specific aims  of this study are to ( hypotheses are described in Italics) : 
Aim 1:   Conduct a randomized intervention trial (120 patients in each treatment or placebo arm) 
to evaluate the main effect of reducing the dietary Ca/Mg intake ratio  to under 2.6 by 
[CONTACT_651234]:  
1) Primary endpoints : Increas ing the expression of apoptosis biomarkers (e.g. TUNEL and 
Bax) and reduc ing expression of TR PM7, COX -2 (inflammation) and Ki -67 (proliferation 
index) , pMLKL  in colorectal mucosa .   
2) Secondary endpoints : Increas ing serum levels of magnesium and vitamin D and 
reduc ing plasma conc entration of C -reactive protein. Reduc ing urinary excretion of 
prostaglandin E 2 metabolite (PGE -M). Increas ing body magnesium store (magnesium 
tolerance test) . 
We hypothesize the reduction in the dietary Ca/Mg intake ratio  among those with a high ratio 
may improve magnesium status, reduce magnesium transport er expression, reduce level of 
colorectal and systemic inflammation, increase colorectal apoptosis, reduce colorectal cell 
proliferation and, in turn, lead to a decreased risk of colorectal cancer.  
Aim 2:    Evaluate the interaction between magnesium treatment and the Thr1482Ile 
polymorphism (G →A).  The intervention trial will be a [ADDRESS_873322] factor is 
magnesium supplementation (modulation of the dietary Ca/Mg intake ratio). The second factor 
is the Thr1482Ile polymorphism genotype. Therefore, in either treatment or placebo arms (120 
patients in each arm), w e will randomly include [ADDRESS_873323] one A allele through genotype screening, then we will 
randomly assign them to the treatment or placebo arms with a 1:[ADDRESS_873324] 
about 10 subjects with AA genotype. For the AA carriers, the randomization will be stratified on 
genotype to ensure an equal number of AA genotypes will be assigned to the two arms.   
We hypothesize that reducing the dietary Ca/Mg intake ratio  will more significantly improve the 
body magnesium status and lead to more pronounced changes on primary endpoints among 
those who carry at least one variant A allele, particularly those with the AA genotype, compared 
to those who possess the GG genotype.  
The focus of this proposed study is on the evaluation of gene -nutrient (Ca/Mg intake ratio) 
interaction in the development of colorectal cancer. The hypotheses proposed in the application 
are novel and based on strong biological plausibility and our recent findings from the TCPS and 
several other studies.  
 
3.[ADDRESS_873325] quintile of total calcium consumption from both dietary and 
supplemental sources may confer a 14% reduction in colorectal cancer risk versus the lowest 
quintile, with the association only being significant among people with high intake of vitamin D. 
Consistent with the results from these epi[INVESTIGATOR_29820], two large intervention trials 
observed that calcium s upplementation moderately reduced the risk of recurrent colorectal 
adenoma , while  one trial found that this protective effect may only be present in those with a 
high blood level of vitamin D. Baron et al found in the observational phase of a clinical trial that 
the protective effect of calcium supplementation on colorectal adenoma recurrence rate extends 
up to 5 years after cessation of active treatment . However, results from a very recent large -scale 
randomized clinical trial (Women's Health Initiative, WHI) do not support an effect of calcium 
plus vitamin D supplementation on the incidence of colorectal cancer after 7 years of follow -up.

Protocol Date:  06-08-[ADDRESS_873326] Asian populations traditionally at low risk for colorectal 
cancer and other chronic diseases, while the Ca/Mg intake ratio  is much higher. We also found 
in the TCPS that the inverse association between intakes of calcium and magnesium only 
appear among those with a low Ca/Mg intake ratio. Very recently, we confirmed this finding in a 
large  clinical trial of colorectal adenoma recurrence. Furthermore, we found in the TCPS that the 
Ca/Mg intake ratio significantly interacts with the Thr1482Ile polymorphism (rs8042919 , G→A) in 
the TRPM7  gene , critical to calcium and magnesium (re)absorption and balance ; and w e also 
found that the protective effect of calcium and magnesium on the risk of colorectal adenoma 
may differ by  [CONTACT_651235].  Based on these findings, the inconsistency on the associations 
between calcium and magnesium and risk of colorectal cancer could be due to: 1) Inter -person 
variation in the ability to absorb or reabsorb calcium or magnesium was not considered in any 
previous study; 2) Ca/Mg intake ratio has not been considered in any previous studies.  
To further evaluate these novel findings, we propose a novel personalized intervention trial in 
which treatment (reducing Ca/Mg intake ratio ) is based on the individual’s baseline dietary 
Ca/Mg intake ratio . Furthermore, we will be able to examine the potential gene -treatment 
interaction. Tumorigenesis -related biomarkers, including apoptosis and proliferation index ,

supplementation of magnesium (modulating Ca/Mg intake ratio ) on secondary endpoints, such 
as serum CRP and plasma vitamin D.

the study.  Eligible participants  will be identified based on the screening criteria by [CONTACT_651238] (TCPS)  and Tenness ee-Indiana 
Adenoma Recurrence Study (TIARS)  and will be limited to participants who have previously 
provide written informed consent to be contact[CONTACT_451338].   Patients with 
colorectal adenoma or/and hyperplastic polyp diagnosed at Vanderbilt Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_651170] . In addition, participants will be recruited from other resources, 
such as from those who contact [CONTACT_651239].gov website  (ELIGIBILITY FORM 1, Appendix B ). This 
generated list of potential participants will be delivered to the research staff for this new study. 
Participants still eligible after a review of the medical record for eligibility (ELIGIBILITY FORM 2 , 
Appendix B ) for an initial screening will be mailed an introductory letter signed by [CONTACT_651240] [INVESTIGATOR_651171].   A few days after the letter is mailed, the trained 
research staff of the Survey Research Shared Resource will call the potential participant to 
provide more detailed information about the study, answer questions about the study, and to 
see if they may be interested in participating.   During the telephone conversation, a series of 
YES/NO screening questions are administered to determine eligibility for the intervention based 
on the exclusion criteria (Eligibility Form 3 , Appendix B ).  If the person appears eligible, implied 
verbal consent will be obtained to conduct the baseline interview survey and [ADDRESS_873329]

We will recruit participants who are in general good health and able to participate in a low to 
moderate intensity supplement intervention.  Additional exclusion criteria are intended to avoid 
potential side effects and control for potentially confounding variables that might limit our data 
analysis.  .  This research will not involve fetuses, neonates, pregnant women, children, 
prisoners, institutionalized individuals, or others who may be considered a vulnerable 
population. Participants are anticipated to be between the ages of 40 to 85 years of age. 
Participants will be primarily recruited from two existing large adenoma stud ies, TCPS and 
TIARS,  who agreed to be contact[CONTACT_7678].  We will also recruit participa nts from 
patients with colorectal adenoma or/and hyperplastic polyp diagnosed at Vanderbilt University

addition, p articipants  from other resources will be recruited to screen for the trial , such as from 
those who contact [CONTACT_651244].gov website . This generated list of potential participants will be delivered to 
the research staff for this new study. Participants still eligible after a review of the medical 
record for eligibility (ELIGIBILITY FORM 2 , Appendix B) for an initial screening will be mailed an 
introductory letter signed by [CONTACT_651245] [INVESTIGATOR_651173].   A few days 
after the letter is mailed, the trained research staff of the Survey Research Shared Resource will 
call the potential participant to provide more detailed information about the study, answer 
questions about the study, and to see if they may be interested in participating.   During the 
telephone conversation, a series of YES/NO screening questions are administered to determine 
eligibility for the intervention based on the exclusion criteria ( RECRUITMENT ELIGIBILITY  AND 
BASELINE INTERVIEW FORM  3, Appendix B).  If the person appears eligible, implied verbal 
consent will be obtained to conduct the baseline interview survey and [ADDRESS_873346] of the study.   The candidate is asked to sign the consent 
form, and the participant will be provided a copy of their signed form. We will recruit and 
randomly assign participants to magnesium supplementation (treatment) and placebo arms until  
these  participants have completed the entire study process.

Protocol Version  #: 34.0  30 
Protocol Date:  06-08-[ADDRESS_873357] collected a FFQ in the TCPS ( IRB # 090235) . In this study, we will perform two 
baseline [ADDRESS_873358] by [CONTACT_651252] . The Ca/Mg intake ratio will be calculated from the 24 -hour recalls to confirm the 
current ratio, to determine eligibility, and to determine the appropriate dose of magnesium 
supplementation in the treatment arm to reduce the ratio to < 2.6 or the number of placebo 
capsules in the placebo arm. They will also be used to verify the dietary Ca/Mg intake ratio, 
excluding any treatment magnesium, remains stable throughout the intervention period. Thus 
participants will also complete 4 additional 24 -hr dietary assessments during the intervention 
phase ; 2 times of diet recalls at week 1 - 6, and 2 times at week 7-12 throughout the course of 
the magnesium treatment.  
Dietary intake will be measured using the 24 -hour recall (24HR) assessment approach. The 
24HR is the least biased method of dietary assessment during an intervention.  Compared to a 
food record or food diary, the 24HR is less time consuming for the participant, and does not rely 
on their concentration and recording skills.  The 24HR approach is interviewer based, and the 
interviewer is able to probe as needed. Therefore, dietary monitoring is not as reliant on the 
personality attributes of the study participant.  Nutrient scores from multiple 24HRs are highly 
correlated with nutrient scores from a food record, and the total variance of nutrient scores from 
multiple 24HRs is smaller than the variance derived from food records.  
The research staff in the Survey Research Shared Resource ( SRSR) will administer the recall 
using the Minnesota Nutrient Data System (NDS) which is licensed to the SRSR. NDS uses a 
multiple -pass approach with prompts displayed throughout the interview to assist in data 
collection and review. In this phone -based dietary assessment, we will also obtain questionnaire 
information on the participant’s use of medications, nutritional supplements, and other 
conditions. Nutrient scores  are calculated from each 24HR (e.g., fat g/d, energy kcal/d, calcium 
mg/day, etc.) using the Nutritional Data System (University of Minnesota).  Vitamin, mineral, 
fiber and other supplementation use are monitored by [CONTACT_941] 24HRs, and nutrients derived from 
supplementation are added to nutrients from dietary sources.   
Two baseline [ADDRESS_873359] -assisted recall method. Detailed procedures for each method are described as follows.

The procedures for completion of two baseline 24-hour recalls using a food -record 
assisted  dietary recall approach  (April, 2012)   
It was very time -consuming to complete the two baseline 24-hour diet recalls  by [CONTACT_651255] , which might slow down the 
participant recruitment process . To speed up the participant recruitment, in April of 2012, we 
plan to use a new approach  of food -record assisted 48-hour diet recall , utilizing the two-day 
food record s to complete two 24 h our dietary recalls over one phone call interview.  Based on 
the current 24 -hour recall data  we collected in our study , we found the weekday nutrient intakes 
are similar to those on the weekend day. Participants will be assigned to complete t wo-day food 
records of any one of the six combinations, Monday and Tuesday, Tuesday and Wednesday, 
Wednesday and Thursday, Thursday and Friday, Friday and Saturday, or Saturday and 
Sunday. The detailed procedures are described as follows.   
 
• Participant s will be told of the calls at initial contact  [CONTACT_651253] . 
• Convenient windows of time to call participant are confirmed . 
• Participants will receive a Food Amount s Booklet , two Food Record Forms, Food R ecord  
Instructions   by [CONTACT_2319] (FOOD AMOUNT BOOKLET, FOOD RECORD FORMS, FOOD 
RECORD  INSTRUCTIONS, Appendix C).   
• Participants will complete two food records of any one of the six combinations  of day of 
week , Sunday and Monday, Monday and Tuesday, Tuesday and Wednesday, Wednesday 
and Thursday, Thursday and Friday, Friday and Saturday , which will be randomly 
assigned to participants. The participants will record all the foods and drinks they have 
from the twelve midnight of the assigned day of week to the next twelve midnight.  They 
will complete two food record forms in two consecutive days of the week . A separate form 
will be used for each day.   
• If individuals have had an acute or short -term illness in the past two days (48 hours) , 
which substantially changed their usual diet, the two food records should be completed 
over the two days after their diet changes back to normal .   
 
Protocol Version  #: 34.0  32 
Protocol Date:  06-08-2022 • The two baseline 24-hour dietary recall assessments for each participant will be made to 
obtain current intake information prior to the baseline treatment by [CONTACT_651256] . The phone call will be placed within a couple of days after participants complete 
their food records .  
• A trained research member in the SRSR telephones the participant (Script for 48 Hour 
Dietary Recall _2012 , Appendix C) and ask s what they consumed the two days before  they 
are called .  
o Working through each meal, snack, beverage, and supplement information is 
entered directly into a computer  
o The Nutritional Data System will calculate nutrient scores  
• Each 24HR requires up to 30 minutes .  
• Four additional 24 -hr dietary assessments will be conducted during the intervention phase; 
using the record -assisted method , two times of diet recalls at week  1-6 and two times at 
week 7-12 throughout the course of the magnesium treatment.  
• Nutrient scores  are calculated from each 24HR (e.g., fat g/d, energy kcal/d, calcium 
mg/day, etc.) using the Nutritional Data System (University of Minnesota).  Vitamin, 
mineral, fiber and other supplementation use are monitored by [CONTACT_941] 24HRs, and nutrients 
derived from supplementation are added to nutrients from dietary sources.    
• If missed, the phone call will be placed and completed immediately on the next two days . 
 
     
Prior to enrollment, two baseline 24 hour dietary recalls  are performed to estimate 
participants’  current diet intake  information  for determining participants’ eligibility and for 
calculating the dosage of magnesium/placebo supplementation . The time interval window 
between [ADDRESS_873362] clinical visit should be within approximately 3 
months.  Otherwise the two baseline 24 hour diet recalls should be conducted again.

Protocol Date:  06-08-2022 E. Randomization and Intervention  
 
Randomization  Protocols  
 
A randomized controlled study is one in which there are two groups, one treatment group and 
one control group. The treatment group receives the treatment under investigation, and the 
control group receives placebo. Assigning patients at random reduces the risk of bias and 
increases the probability that differences between the groups can be attributed to the treatment. 
Randomization is used to determine who will receive the magnesium supplement and who will 
receive placebo treatment.  
This study will enroll  288 participants  with colorectal hyperplastic polyp or/and adenoma, polyps 
free but being at high risk of colorectal polyps  or cancer.  [ADDRESS_873363] GA/AA genotype. Within the two genotype groups, a permuted -block 
randomization algorithm will be used to allocate the subjects into the treatment/placebo arm.   
Finally, these participants will be randomized to either treatment or placebo using a double -blind 
two-factorial (Ca/Mg intake ratio and genotype) design so that each treatment/placebo arm will 
contain [ADDRESS_873364] one A allele .  
Procedure s 
• The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_651180] a list of the [ADDRESS_873365] GA/AA genotype.  
• [CONTACT_20266], the co -PI, will conduct the randomization and provide a script to randomly 
allocate the participants into each treatment/placebo arm within the two genotype 
groups.  
• Each treatment/placebo arm will contain [ADDRESS_873366] one A allele .  
• Both the participants and the study staff will be blind to randomization status until 
the conclusion of the study. Pharmacists are un -blinded to randomization status 
and treatment assignment.

under 2.6 by [CONTACT_651258], inflammatory 
biomarkers and magnesium status and to estimate the potential interaction between magnesium 
treatment and the Thr1482Ile polymorphism (G →A) of the TRPM7  gene. The study will enroll  
288 participants  with colorectal hyperplastic polyp or/and adenoma, polyps free but being at 
high risk of colorectal polyps or cancer, [ADDRESS_873368] GA/AA genotype. These  participants will be randomized to either treatment or placebo 
using a double -blind two -factorial (Ca/Mg intake ratio and genotype) design so that each 
treatment/placebo arm will contain [ADDRESS_873369] one A allele . Based on the participant’s Ca/Mg intake ratio (obtained from the two 
24-hour recalls), he or she will be assigned to a dose that will reduce the Ca/Mg intake ratio to 
around 2.3 (less than 2.6 but no less than 2.0).  The dose of magnesium supplementation is 
personalized based on the current intake ratio.  The duration of the study from recruitment 
through the end of the intervention is approximately 14 weeks including a 12 -week intervention. 
(See attached Figure E2) 
The trial will be double -blind: neither participants nor research staff who interacts with the 
participants or their samples will be aware of the treatment assignments.  The treatment period 
will last for 12 weeks.  
Procedures:  
1. Intervention layout  
• Based on the participant’s Ca/Mg intake ratio (obtained from the two 24 -hour recalls), 
the participant will be assigned to a dose that will reduce the Ca/Mg intake ratio to 
around 2.3 (less than 2.6 but no less than 2.0). Each dose will correspond to one or 
multiple capsules from three different sizes of magnesium supplementation or 
placebo.   
• Presented in Table E2 is the detailed treatment dosage based on baseline 
calcium/magnesium ratio and calcium intake level as well as resulting 
calcium/magnesium ratio after supplementation. Treatment or placebo capsules will 
be discarded if they are not used within 6 -months.  
• Based on the participant’s Ca/Mg intake ratio and a table provided by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_610604], the research staff will devise standard operating procedures for the Vanderbilt 
Investigational Drug Service  (VIDS ) to follow with regard to preparing, labeling, 
blinding, and dispensing study drug.  
• The VIDS will retain a secure set of sealed envelopes containing the treatment 
assignment.  These will be opened in the event of a clinical scenario which 
necessitates unblinding, as determined by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_651181].  
2. Prescription  
• A detailed prescription for Pharmacists, including information on calcium intake, 
calcium and magnesium ratio, genotype, treatment assignment, administration etc, 
will be provided by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Doug Seidner or [CONTACT_651312].  
3. Magnesium capsule and placebo preparation  
 
Protocol Version  #: 34.0  36 
Protocol Date:  06-08-2022 • The magnesium supplementation and placebo capsules will be made by [CONTACT_651259] .  
• The Vanderbilt Investigational Drug Service (VIDS) will be responsible for the storage, 
preparation, and labeling of all investigational agents, and for maintaining accurate 
drug storage and dispensing logs.  
• We have chosen to use magnesium glycinate , a form of magnesium that will avoid a 
laxative side effect. Three sizes of capsules will be used in this study: 515 mg 
delivering 77.25 mg elemental magnesium (Size 1) in blue opaque; 694 mg delivering 
104.1 mg elemental magnesium (Size 0 0) in orange opaque; and 489 mg delivering 
73.35  mg elemental magnesium (Size 1) in green opaque.  
• Identical -appearing placebo (made from  microcrystalline cellulose ) will be made to 
match these three magnesium capsules (Sizes 00  orange opaque , 1 blue opaque , 
and 1  green opaque ).  
4. Dispensation  
The whole intervention period lasts for 12 weeks. Participants will take either magnesium 
or placebo capsules once per day. Participants will be given the magnesium or placebo 
capsule at the Clinical Research Center (CRC) during the first clinic visit (week 0), and the 
second clinic visit at the trial, (week 6).  
1st time to dispense the capsules (during the first clinic visit at the beginning of the 
intervention, week 0)  
• Research staff notify Vanderbilt Investigational Drug Service (VIDS) to anticipate a 
prescription for the day of participant’s baseline visit (week 0).  
• Research staff provide the physician with the information necessary to complete a 
prescription.

Protocol Version  #: 34.0  46 
Protocol Date:  06-08-2022 5. Treatment of side effects of magnesium supplements :  
• When a study participant reports a side effect of diarrhea from taking the study 
supplement, the participant will be instructed to take Loperamide (ImodiumTM), 
according to the manufacturer’s directions for no more than 7 days.    
• If the Loperamide is not effective within 48 hours of beginning the dosing of 
Loperamide, the participant will call the study staff. The supplement dose reduction 
plan will be initiated (see attached table).  
• After 7 days of use the participant will be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530]. If the diarrhea has resolved while 
taking the Loperamide the participant will be instructed to continue to take the 
prescribed dosage of the study supplement.  
• When diarrhea recurs after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_651185], the 
participant will be instructed to resume the manufacturer’s dosing recommendations 
until diarrhea resolves and then decrease the dose of the Loperamide until the 
minimum effective dose is reached. The participant will remain at this minimum dose 
for the remaining time left in their study participation.  If the diarrhea never resolves, 
the supplementation reduction plan will be initiated (see attached table).  
• A participant, who reports side effects of abdominal gas or crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], will be advised 
to take simethicone for relief.  
Both Loperamide (ImodiumTM) and Simethicone (Gas -XTM, FlatulexTM, GenasymeTM, and 
MyliconTM) are inexpensive over -the-counter medications that are safe for long -term use 
and do not alter intestinal absorption patterns.  
 
6. Dose reduction plan:  
When a participant reports that the use of Loperamide is not effective within 48 hours  or 
the diarrhea recur s after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_651186]  (see the attached flowchart) , the supplement dose reduction 
plan will be initiated (see attached table). Six reduction steps are included in the Dose 
Reduction Guidelines.   
• After [ADDRESS_873370] reduction step, the participant will be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530]. If the 
reduction of supplement dosing is ineffective, subsequent reduction steps will be 
implemented and the participant contact[CONTACT_116621] 4 days of reduction until resolution of 
the diarrhea is achieved.  
• If diarrhea does not resolve within 4 reduction steps, the participant will be referred to 
the study physician for consultation.  
• When the diarrhea resolves during the use of the dose reduction step plan, the 
participant will be instructed to return to the use of the initial dosing of the supplement.

Rectal Biopsy Laboratory Protocols  
Procedure  
Tissue Blocks  
Embedding Biopsies  
• To embed biopsy specimens as soon as possible after biopsy  
o Biopsies are fixed and processed for twenty -four hours in a tissue processor.  
o After 24h fixation in neutral buffered formalin, the biopsies are placed in a 
Shandon Hypercenter Processing Center (ThermoShandon, Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109], PA), a 
programmable, automated reagent -moving system used to dehydrate and 
infiltrate fixed tissues with paraffin.  
o Biopsies will be embedded in one paraffin block. Pay attention to embedding 
orientation of the tissues so that well-oriented longitudinal crypts  can be 
sectioned.  
 
Protocol Version  #: 34.0  66 
Protocol Date:  06-08-2022 o The cassettes are labeled with a # 3 pencil on the front side of each block with 
the participants ID # and visit date.    
o Initial water residues are removed from tissues by [CONTACT_651273] (70, 
80, 95, and 100%) sequentially into the reaction chamber.  
o Each alcohol remains in the tissue -containing chamber for approximately 45 
minutes, and a 5 -minute draining period is allowed between alcohol changes.   
Two xylene exchanges are followed by [CONTACT_1192] 60C heated paraffin exchanges, each 
one hour in duration.   
o The paraffin -infiltrated tissues are removed from the Hypercenter, embedded into 
paraffin blocks, and prepared for shipment.  
o Blocks are then stored in the refrigerator in the core lab at 4 degrees C until 
ready for analysis.  
Storage  
• Blocks are stored in the core lab at 4 degrees C  
Slide preparation    
Biopsies will be sectioned with a microtome so that crypts will be longitudinally sectioned from 
base to lumen.  
• Sections are then placed sequentially on positive charged slides and numbered from 1 
to 26.  
• Section levels are Five microns thick, and are taken approximately 50 microns apart.  
(Taking sections 50 microns apart to avoid double counting of crypts in biopsy 
specimens)  
• The sections numbered 1, 11 and 21 will be used for H&E staining.  
• Three slides per biomarker are prepared for processing each of the antibodies for KI -67, 
Bax, COX2, TRPM7 , pMLKL  and the TUNEL assay.  
• Multiple biopsies are collected and multiple sections will be prepared. In case of staining 
run failures, one backup serial section per slide for staining is prepared.  
• All blocks and slides will be stored in a vacuum chamber at [ADDRESS_873390] in the 
Molecular Epi[INVESTIGATOR_651206]. Ki -67 (mib1), bax, COX2, TRPM7 , pMLKL  
expression is detected in colon crypt cells by [CONTACT_651274] (IHC) technique that 
stains positive cells a brown color.  This permits visual identification of cells expressing these 
genes.   
Expression of Ki -67, Bax and COX -[ADDRESS_873391] IHC protocol of EnVision ™+ System, HRP (DAKO). After deparaffinization of the 
tissue slides, antigen retrieval is performed by [CONTACT_651275] a pressure cooker in the 
optimized buffer solutions: Retrievagen A pH6.5 (BD Pharmingen) for Ki -67, R -buffer A 
(Pi[INVESTIGATOR_651207].) for COX -2, and Epi[INVESTIGATOR_651208] (IHCWorld.com) for Bax. The primary 
antibodies of mouse monoclonal anti -Ki-67(BD Bioscience s Pharmingen), mouse monoclonal 
anti-COX -2 (Zymed), and rabbit polyclonal anti -Bax (Santa Cruz) are applied with proper work 
dilutions. The TUNEL  (TdT -mediated dUTP Nick -End Labeling) assay is conducted to measure 
apoptosis of colon epi[INVESTIGATOR_651209] (Promega). The 
expression and co -existence of TRPM7  is detected using a sequential double 
immunofluorescent staining proposed by [CONTACT_651276] (Protocol: Double 
Immunofluorescent Labeling Using Primary Antibodies from Diff erent Species: 
http://www.vectorlabs.com/infopage.asp?dpID=53&locID=684325 ). In brief, antigen retrieval is

Protocol Version  #: 34.0  67 
Protocol Date:  06-08-2022 slides are blocked with Avidin/Biotin Blocking Kit (Vector) and 5% normal goat serum, incubated 
with 1st primary antibody (rabbit polyclonal anti -TRPM6, Abcam), biotinylated goat anti -rabbit 
IgG (Vector), and fluorescein avidin DCS (Vector).  For staining of second antigen, the blocking 
step is repeated with Avidin/Biotin Blocking Kit (Vector) and 5% normal rabbit serum, the slides 
are incubated with the 2nd  primary antibody (Sheep polyclonal anti -TRPM7 (Abcam), 
biotinylated rabbit anti -sheep IgG (Vector), and [LOCATION_007] red avidin DCS (Vector). The slides are 
washed and coverslipped with the anti -fade and anti -photobleaching VECTASHIELD HardSet 
Mounting Medium with DAPI (Vector). A lab -constructed tissue microarray block composed of 
lymph node, kidney, lung, small intestine and known positive and negative colon adenoma 
tissues for these biomarkers is used as control slide. The control slide is stained in parallel with 
each batch using an Autostainer Universal Staining System (DAKO).  
Scoring Procedures :  
All biomarkers will be scored using imaging analysis.  We use a system composed of an 
Olympus BX40 microscope, a Retiga FAST 1394 color digital camera and BioQuant NOVA 
Prime imaging software (BioQuant, Nashville, TN). The video images are captured using a 10X 
objective lens under a constant state of exposure control. Approximately [ADDRESS_873392] tools are used to exclude blank, folding, hemorrhage, necrosis, poorly stained, and 
stromal areas, whereas threshold tools are used to precisely define and measure total epi[INVESTIGATOR_651210], total nuclear area, positively stained area, and average gray density151. After all fields of 
each sample are measured, the final immunoreaction indices are generated automatically by 
[CONTACT_651277] ‘‘total positive area / total nuclear area’’ for nuclear staining markers (Ki -
67, TUNEL), or  ‘‘total positive area / total epi[INVESTIGATOR_651211] X average density’’ for 
cytoplasmic/membranous staining markers (Bax, COX -2, TRPM7). Apoptotic activity is also 
scored using standard morphologic criteria applied to H&E stained sections85,86. Briefly, a total 
of 24 to 30 longitudinal crypts at three section levels are scored per biopsy. The cells are 
considered apoptotic if the shrinkage of the cell from its neighbors, chromatin condensation and 
nuclear fragmentation (karyorrhexis) are presented. Cells manifesting these criteria are included 
in apoptosis scores only when observed in isolated, single cells not associated with an 
inflammatory response. The number of apoptotic cells for each crypt is combined to calculate a 
mean apoptosis score per crypt for each specimen.  
Quality Control  
[CONTACT_651316], the study pathologist, has had over 23 years of experience in conducting pathologic 
studies of cancers. He will be blinded to the treatment and genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_651212] (in total, 7200 biomarkers slides and 1440 H&E slides). Furthermore, 
the co -PI ([CONTACT_538424]) will randomly select 10% of slides (864 slides) for rescoring. For the 
rescoring, [CONTACT_651316] and a research staff  will score the slides independently. Inter -scorer 
agreement will be compared and calculated.  
Cell/ Tissue culture  
We will test the carcinogenesis -related biomarkers and use the vitro system to identify the most 
effective and optimized agents. (1) cell biological features: epi[INVESTIGATOR_651213]; 
(2) immunophenotypes: CK5/14; CK8/18; Pan -CK; Vimentin; Smooth muscle actin detected by

Protocol Date:  06-08-2022 • --- Blood Sample Collection  
 
Blood Draw Protocol  
In the study, erythrocyte magnesium  (a candidate biomarker for marginal magnesium 
deficiency) will be used as the primary endpoint to monitor magnesium status and the 
compliance of treatment, complimented by [CONTACT_263818], serum magnesium . Blood 
samples will be collected at weeks 0, 6 and 12 during the course of magnesium treatment.  
In the study, serum magnesium , vitamin D  and plasma C -reactive protein will be measured as 
secondary endpoints to evaluate the effects of the reduction of dietary Ca/Mg intake ratio by 
[CONTACT_651279].  
A fasting blood  (15 ml for each person) will be drawn into serum, EDTA, and heparin tubes . A 
blood sample will be collected on the biopsy collection day at the beginning and the end of the 
intervention phase respectively, at week 0 and week 12.  An additional blood sample will be 
collected at the midpoint of the intervention phase, at week 6.  
Location          
Clinical Research Center (CRC) Medical Center North, 3rd floor on the Vanderbilt 
Campus     
Scheduling  
Participants will receive a schedule of planned blood draw , possibly fasting blood draw . 
Approved research staff with demonstrated competency will draw blood in CRC 
procedure rooms. A blood sample will be collected on the biopsy collection day at the 
beginning and the end of the intervention phase respectively, at week [ADDRESS_873393] less than or equal to 7 days prior to the final clinic visit. Participants will 
receive $25 for each blood draw.  
Preparation  
• Tourniquet  
• Non-latex disposable gloves  
• Syringe or Evacuated Tubes  
• Needle holder  
• 70% alcohol pads  
• [ADDRESS_873394] or hand  
• Red, Lavender and Green top collection tubes  
• Labels  
• 2 x 2 Gauze pads  
• Adhesive Tape or Bandages  
• Biohazard sharps collection container  
Procedure  
• Wash your hands thoroughly and don non -latex disposable gloves to prevent cross -
contamination.  
• Ask the ambulatory patient to sit in a chair and support his arm securely on an armrest 
or tabletop.  
 
Protocol Version  #: 34.0  72 
Protocol Date:  06-08-2022 • Assess the patient’s veins to determine the best puncture site.  Observe the skin for the 
vein’s blue color, or palpate the vein for a firm rebound sensation.  
• Tie a tourniquet 2” proximal to the area chosen.  If the tourniquet fails to dilate the vein, 
have the patient open and close his fist repeatedly.  Then ask him to close his fist as you 
insert the needle and to open it again when the needle is in place.  
• Clean the venipuncture site with an alcohol pad using friction for [ADDRESS_873395] from the site. Allow to dry before performing 
venipuncture.  
• Immobilize the vein by [CONTACT_651280].  
• Position the needle holder or syringe with the needle bevel up and the shaft parallel to 
the path of the vein and at a 30 -degree angle to the arm.  Insert the needle into the vein.  
If you are using a syringe, venous blood will appear in the hub; withdraw the blood 
slowly, pulling the plunger of the syringe gently to create steady suction until you obtain 
the required sample.  Pulling the plunger to forcibly may collapse the vein.  If you’re 
using a needle holder and an evacuated tube, grasp the holder securely to stabilize the 
vein, and push down on the collection tube until the needle punctures the rubber 
stopper.  Blood will flow into the collection tube automatically.  
• Remove the tourniquet as soon as the blood flows adequately to prevent stasis and hem 
concentration, which can impair test results.  If blood flow is sluggish, leave the 
tourniquet in place longer, but always remove it before withdrawing the needle.  
• Continue to fill the required tubes, removing one and inserting another.  Gently rotate 
each tube as you remove it to help mix the additive.  
• After you’ve drawn the sample, place a gauze pad over the puncture site, and slowly and 
gently remove the needle from the vein.  When using and evacuated tube, remove it 
from the needle holder to release the vacuum before withdrawing the needle from the 
vein.  
• Apply gentle pressure to the puncture site for 2 to 3 minutes or until bleeding stops.  This 
prevents extravasation into the surrounding tissue, which causes hematoma.  
• After the bleeding stops, apply an adhesive bandage.  
• If you have used a syringe, transfer the sample to a collection tube.  Detach the needle 
from the syringe, open the collection tube, and gently empty the sample into the tube, 
being careful to avoid foaming, which may cause hemolysis.  
• Label the patient chart with appropriate blood tube labels and record the time of 
collection on B IOLOGICAL SAMPLE COLLECTION FORM (Appendix H) . 
• Place the red and purple top tubes into black wet ice bucket and leave the green top 
tube at room temperature.  
• Finally, check the venipuncture site to make sure a hematoma has not developed.  If it 
has, then apply warm soaks.  
• Discard syringes, needles, and used gloves in the appropriate containers.  
Special Considerations  
• If the patient has large, distended, highly visible veins, perform venipuncture without a 
tourniquet to minimize the risk of hematoma  
• If the patient has a clotting disorder or is receiving anticoagulant therapy, maintain firm 
pressure on the venipuncture site for no less than 5 minutes after withdrawing the 
needle to prevent formation of a hematoma.

Laboratory Assay  
Determination of Total Magnesium in Erythrocytes  
Flame atomic absorption spectroscopy is the most widely used technique for measuring total 
magnesium. The sensitivity of magnesium measured by [CONTACT_651282] a graphite furnace is not required for determination. We will use erythrocytes which are 
washed twice using ice -cold solution before storage at -80°C. These assays are routinely 
conducted in NMS Labs, Inc. In brief, erythrocyte samples will be diluted with 0.5% Lanthanum 
Chloride Solution and analyzed by [CONTACT_651283] a hollow cathode lamp source 
that emits light at a wavelength of 285.2 nm. The sample concentrations are determined by 
[CONTACT_651284] a series 
of standards. Magnesium calibrators are run at 0, 0.40, 1.0, 2.5 and 5.0 mg/dL. This assay is 
regularly validated through inclusion of external standards by [CONTACT_651285]: 
commercial serum at 1.8 and 4.7 mg/dL and in -house blood control at 4.0 mg/dL. The method 
has a coefficient of variation (CV) between runs of 3.0% at target concentrations of 1.8 and 4.7 
mg/dL serum. The between run CV for the blood control is 2.4%. The means of the three 
controls are all within +/ - 3.2%.  
Serum  magnesium  
Serum  magnesium will be determined by [CONTACT_651286] 800 
chemistry analyzer and 24 -hour urine magnesium will be assayed by [CONTACT_651287], both provided by [CONTACT_651288].

Protocol Version  #: 34.0  74 
Protocol Date:  06-08-2022 The radioimmunoassay (RIA) for plasma vitamin D metabolite, 25(OH)D, has been developed 
and validated in [CONTACT_251832]’s laboratory. The RIA assay results compare well with those 
from a liquid -chromatographic procedure involving specific ultraviolet detection of 25(OH) D in 
plasma. This assay has been successfully applied in a number of epi[INVESTIGATOR_651217], including all four previous studies on the association 
between blood 25(OH)D and risk of colorectal cancer or adenoma. Antibodies will be generated 
in a goat immunized with the vitamin D analog 23, 24, 25, 26, 27 -pentanor -C(22) -carboxylic acid 
of vitamin D, coupled directly with bovine serum albumin. The 125I-labeled tracer will be prepared 
by [CONTACT_651289] a 3 -amino -propyl derivative of vitamin D -C(22) -amide with Bolton -Hunter reagent. 
Calibrators will be prepared in vitamin D -stripped human serum. 25(OH) D will be quantitatively 
extracted from serum or plasma (50 µl) with acetonitrile. The assay will consist of a 90 -min 
incubation at room temperature with primary antiserum, followed by a 20 -min incubation with a 
second antiserum and separation of bound from free fractions by [CONTACT_7891]. The detection 
limit of the assay will be 2.8 mg/L for 25(OH) D.

Light Hall, [ADDRESS_873397]. Cai’s Molecular 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_651218].  
Laboratory assay:  
Quantification of Urinary metabolite of PGE2 (PGE -M) 
Urinary PGE -M (11 alpha -hydroxy -9,15-dioxo -2,3,4,5 -tetranor -prostane -1,20-dioic acid) level will 
be measured using a liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometric method described 
previously, at the Integrated Health Sciences Facility Core of the Vanderbilt Center in Molecular 
Toxicology, directed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Milne (see letter of support). Briefly, 0.75 mL urine will be acidified to 
pH 3 with HCl and endogenous PGE -M will be then converted to the O-methyloxime derivative 
by [CONTACT_651290]. The methoximated PGE -M will be extracted, applied to a C -
18 Sep -Pak, and eluted with ethyl acetate. An [2H6]O-methyloxime PGE -M internal standard will 
be then added. Liquid chromatography will be performed on a Zorbax Eclipse XDB -C18 column 
attached to a ThermoFinnigan Surveyor MS Pump (Thermo Finnigan, San Jose, CA). For 
endogenous PGE -M, the predominant product ion m/z 336 representing [M -(OCH 3+H2O)]- and 
the analogous ion, m/z 339 (M -OC[2H3+H2O), for the deuterated internal standard, will be 
monitored in the selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mode. Quantification of endogenous PGE -
M will utilize the ratio of the mass chromatogram peak areas of the m/z 336 and m/z 339 ions. 
The lower limit of detection of PGE -M was in the range of 40 pg, approximately 100 -fold below 
levels in normal human urine. The coefficient of variation for samples analyzed in multiple 
batches was 7.2%.  
 
Urinary Creatinine Me asurement  
Urinary creatinine levels will be determined spectrophotometrically using a kit from Sigma 
Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO) as performed previously . This assay requires 0.[ADDRESS_873398] kit from Sigma Compan y (Sigma, St. Louis, MO).  The 
assay is based on a modification of the Jaffe reaction by [CONTACT_651291] a creatinine pi[INVESTIGATOR_651219].  In our previous studies, the mean 
CVs for intra - and inter -assay variability were found to be 4.1 % and 6.7%, respectively.

Education  
The interventions under study are believed to reduce the risk of adenoma recurrence and to 
have minimal, if any, toxic effects.   Each participant provides informed consent prior to 
participation, and our monitoring program is designed to identify any adverse events.  
Across all intervention arms, participants are instructed to monitor for any signs or symptoms, 
including dizziness, flushing, muscle paralysis, troubled breathing, diarrhea and others.  They 
are instructed to report these symptoms to study staff.   Participants have the contact [CONTACT_651295].   Participants receive this information verbally during the initial 
counseling session and each telephone monitoring call.   Instructions in writing are provided 
during the One -on-One clinic visit session. Participants are encouraged to call or e -mail with 
questions or concerns, and participants may receive additional counseling to address the 
specific event.  
Patient monitoring after rectal biopsy  After the biopsy, the patient is monitored for thirty minutes. 
The CRC staff will check blood pressure and have the patient go to the restroom to check for 
bleeding prior to leaving the clinic. Patient is told that they can expect some blood on the tissue 
on the day of the biopsy. Bleeding heavier or more persistent than this should be reported. They 
should also report anal or lower abdominal pain, fever, a foul anal discharge, or anything else 
they thi nk could be related to the biopsy. The gastroenterologists and the supporting medical 
team will handle emergencies.  Any other problems discovered by [CONTACT_651296]'s 
gastroenterologists or primary care physician who will also be informed after written consent by 
[CONTACT_102]. Any unexpected anoscopy events (> grade 1 pain events  and any other 
complications to the biopsies ) will be recorded on an Adverse Ev ents Form;  information will 
include a description of the complication, a rating of the severity, other essential information 
needed to evaluate the complication, an assessment of the likelihood that the event was due to 
a study procedure, and a statement of action taken.  All potential complications of biopsies are 
rated as mild, moderate, or severe.  Minor problems after the procedure are handled in 
consultation with the gastroenterologist, and recorded in the study file.  If undue complications 
of biopsie s or other procedures arise, the study will be stopped ahead of schedule.  In addition, 
in the event of a severe or life -threatening complication, the Vanderbilt Cancer Center Clinical 
protocol Review Committee will be immediately notified. Only participants with ongoing 
doctor/patient relationships will be used in this study.  Patients will continue their usual care with

vs. GA vs. AA) and the second factor is intervention (magnesium treatment: modulating dietary 
Ca/Mg intake ratio versus placebo). The primary endpoints, which are all continuous variables, 
include apoptosis biomarkers (e.g. TUNEL and Bax), and expression of TRPM7, pMLKL, COX -2 
(inflammation) and Ki -67 (proliferation index) in colorectal mucosa . . The secondary endpoints 
include serum level magnesium, serum vitamin D, plasma concentration of C -reactive protein , 
and other biomarkers  as well as  magnesium status (magnesium tolerance test), and urinary 
excretion of prostaglandin E 2 metabolite (PGE -M). 
Procedures  
Standard graphing and screening techniques  will be used to detect outliers and to ensure data 
accuracy.  Distributions of continuous outcomes will be assessed for normality. If normality is 
violated, proper data transformation will be applied or non -parametric analysis methods will be 
considered. Summary statistics for both continuous (mean ± standard deviation) and categorical 
variables (count and percent) will be provided by [CONTACT_651299]. Specific inferences on effects of interest will be made by [CONTACT_34055] a point estimate 
along with a 95% confidence interval and the p value. Hypotheses will be tested at the level of  
α=0.05. This data analysis plan will be carried out using statistical software SAS® (Cary, North 
Carolina) or statistical analysis package R ( R Development Core Team, 2008 ). These basic 
statistical rules will be applied to all study aims.  
Univariate anal yses will be conducted for these ten primary and secondary end points 
(continuous variables) in relationship to magnesium treatment and placebo using between -
group t -test or non -parametric tests within genotype groups. The difference in the study 
endpoints (primary+secondary) between magnesium supplement and placebo will be estimated 
for the genotype groups (GG, GA, AA and GA and AA combined) along with their 95% 
confidence intervals. The interaction between the genotype and intervention will be estimated as 
the difference of the within -genotype magnesium supplement versus placebo differences.  
Two-way ANOVA or ANCOVA analyses  will be conducted to analyze the primary and 
secondary endpoints with intervention and genotype in the model (ANOVA) or other potential 
confounders including polyp type, size, and location for primary hyperplastic polyp or/and 
adenoma as well as body mass index, age, total energy intake, and intakes of other nutrients 
(average of six 24 -hour recalls) in the model (ANOCOVA). Overall intervention effect and 
genotype effect and their interactions will be tested.   
 
Administrative Interim analyses Administrative interim analyses may be performed as needed 
prior to the completion of the clinical trial over the [ADDRESS_873415] any intention to stop the trial at these interim analyses, thus 
there is no need to establish a stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877]. A biostatistician from outside the study team will 
perform such analyses on unblinded data. All study team members remain blinded until the 
completion of the study.  However, summarized study group -level data  from such interim 
analyses may be communicated to the study PI’s solely for the purpose of planning other 
studies.

Magnesium has been widely used in clinical practice and tested in previous clinical trials; it has 
been well tolerated in previous clinical trials and the reported rate of adverse events has been 
low. No severe adverse event has been observed even when it was administered intravenously 
among pregnant women. On the other hand, magnesium supplementation improves insulin 
resistance and reduces insulin level. Growing evidence from studies conducted in Western 
societies has linked low intake of magnesium to insulin resistance and systemic inflammation 
and, thus, risk of diseases common in Western countries, such as type II diabetes, coronary 
heart disease, and recently colorectal cancer.  Magnesium supplementation improves insulin 
resistance and reduces insulin level. According to data from the US National Health and 
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), 1999 -2000, 79% of US adults do not meet the 
Recommended Dietary Allowances  (RDA)  of magnesium.  In our proposed study, the dose of 
magnesium supplementation is personalized based on the current intake ratio ; thus, the dose 
used is generally smaller than that used in most previous studies. E ach dose will not surpass 
the sex - and age -specific DRI for magnesium by [CONTACT_726] 100mg/day. Furthermore, we use 
additional exclusion criteria to avoid potential side effects for subgroups of participants, 
including potential drug -magnesium interactions, providing additional assurance for the safety of 
participants. Our protocol enrolls patients believed to be healthy.   As an alternative, participants 
may choose to temporarily or permanently stop supplementation if they feel a complication is 
unacceptable.  
 
A possible complication of venipuncture  is bleeding or the development of a small hematoma at 
 
Protocol Version  #: 34.0  95 
Protocol Date:  06-08-[ADDRESS_873418] pressure at the point of injection will stop this 
bleeding.   Occasionally blood collection will cause a small hematoma, which will heal without 
permanent damage.    
The dietary assessment (i.e., 24 -hour recall), and measurement of height, weight, and body 
circumferences, and urine collection, present no physical risks.      
Physical risks related to rectal biopsy  For rectal biopsy, no fasting or bowel cleansing 
preparations is required. Participants are asked to have a bowel movement prior to arriving at 
clinic. Rectal biopsy has been used in a number of previous studies conducted by [CONTACT_651300] -investigator ([CONTACT_651319], gastroenterologist). In general, the risk is low. However, rectal biopsy may lead to rectal 
bleeding, infections or other complications, including severe or life -threatening complications. 
Any unexpected anoscopy events ( > Grade 1 pain events  and any other  complications to the 
biopsies ) will be recorded on an Adverse Events Form. Furthermore, we have developed a 
comprehensive procedure to monitor and report adverse events, prevent and treat 
complications . 
Psychological Risks  
Psychological risks could occur if participants feel manipulated or coerced by [CONTACT_25617].   Further risks are that participants may feel that study personnel judge participants 
based on reported behaviors.   The likelihood of these events is very small.   Informed consent is 
obtained before any counseling regarding the intervention, and all counselors are trained and 
monitored to present information in a non -judgmental manner.    
Social Risks  
Social risks could occur if confidentiality is violated.   As well, dissemination of information 
obtained from genetic research has the potential of adversely affecting employability or 
insurability.   The likelihood of such adverse events is very small, since identifying information 
will be rigorously protected.   Only coded ID numbers will be used to label samples and other 
research materials.

Any unexpected anoscopy events (> Grade 1 pain events and any other complications to the 
biopsies) will be recorded on an Adverse Events Form; information will include a description of 
the complication, a rating of the severity, other essential information needed to evaluate the 
complication, an assessment of the likelihood that the event was due to a study procedure, and 
a statement of action taken.  All potential complications of biopsies are rated as mild, moderate, 
or severe.  Minor problems after the procedure are handled in consultation with the 
gastroenterologist, and recorded in the subject's study file.  If undue complications of biopsies or 
other procedures arise, the study will be stopped ahead of schedule.  In addition, in the event of 
a severe or life -threatening complication, the Vanderbilt IRB will be immediately notified. 
Patients will continue their usual care with the physician.  Telephone numbers for the PI [INVESTIGATOR_651226].  Emergencies will be handled by [CONTACT_651269].  
Monitoring of other adverse events  Throughout the trial, we will closely monitor for adverse 
events through telephone calls, monitoring following a clinic visit, and 
questionnaire.   Participants will be called the day following the rectal biopsy collection. We will 
call participants once a week for the first two weeks and once every two weeks thereafter, 
during which they are asked about dizziness, flushing, muscle paralysis, troubled breathing, 
diarrhea, or other discomforts or adverse effects potentially related to the intervention 
protocols.   Our research objectives include identifying these problems, such that the value of 
these interventions might be assessed.   Reported adverse events are recorded on an Adverse 
Report Form, reported to the Project Director and PI, who will contact [CONTACT_651301], and submitted to the IRB.   Questionnaires are administered at baseline and 
each follow -up.  Each questionnaire contains a list of potential symptoms, and participants 
report the frequency of each symptom during the prior week.   Participants may write -down other 
symptoms that they have experienced during this period on the questionnaire, as 
well.  Participants also are queried for changes in health status or medication use, which may 
lead to ineligibility and study exclusion.   These questionnaires will be reviewed, and the Project 
director will be informed of those participants reporting any symptom s.  
Adverse events will be considered as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject, even those 
not necessarily having a causal relationship with the study.   Serious adverse events (SAEs) will 
be classified as untoward medical occurrences that a) result in death, b) are life threatening, c) 
require inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or d) result in persistent or significant disability/incapacity.   All 
AEs will be recorded on an Adverse Event Form and graded as Mild (no limitation of usual 
activities), Moderate (some limitation), or Severe (inability to carry out usual activities) and 
attributed according to the relationship to the study intervention and/or procedures (Not related, 
Unlikely, Possible, Probable, or Definite).   Action taken by [CONTACT_651302].   These forms remain as part of the participant's file.   Mild events will be recorded and 
reviewed as they occur by [CONTACT_651303], [CONTACT_651320], in 
consultation with Drs. Seidner and Ness as needed.   AEs will be reviewed as a matter of course 
in monthly meetings of study investigators and staff.  All Moderate and Severe AEs will be 
reported to the Vanderbilt IRB within 5 working days, and severe events will be reported to NIH 
within 5 working days.   On the anniversary date of the initial IRB approval for investigator -
initiated clinical trials, the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_651227]’s safety experience and efficacy over the

9.0 Statistical Considerations  
 
Power analysis:  Our primary endpoints include apoptosis biomarkers (e.g. TUNEL and Bax), 
and expression of TRPM7, COX -2 (inflammation) and Ki -67 (proliferation index) , pMLKL  in 
colorectal mucosa as well as magnesium status (total erythrocyte magnesium, magnesium 
tolerance test), and urinary excretion of prostaglandin E 2 metabolite (PGE -M).  No study has 
ever reported the effects of magnesium supplementation on the primary endpoints in the 
mucosa or any other tissues of the colorectum. Our study will be the first study of this kind. 
However, all the anti -carcinogenesis effect of magnesium supplementation will be related to the 
change in the level of body magnesium status. Therefore, we based our power analysis on the 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_651228], one of the primary study endpoints.  
We have conducted a pi[INVESTIGATOR_651229] [ADDRESS_873421] deviations 
by [CONTACT_651304]7  genotype among colorectal 
adenoma patients with a high dietary ratio 
of calcium to magnesium (ratio>2.6). Even 
with such a small sample size, we still 
found a statistically significant (p=0.04) 
difference in the mean of erythrocyte 
magnesium between the GG and the 
GA/AA combined group (only one subject 
with the AA genotype).  On the other 
hand, we did not find a significant difference by [CONTACT_651305] a low 
dietary ratio of calcium to magnesium. These results are consistent with those we recently 
reported on the interaction between calcium/magnesium intake ratio and the TRPM7 
polymorphism in relation to both colorectal adenoma and hyperplastic polyps (e.g. increased 
risk of colorectal adenoma associated with the GA or AA genotype only appeared in those with 
a high calcium/magnesium ratio, but not in those with a low ratio). Based on these findings, we 
expect the primary treatment effect (modulating high calcium/magnesium ratio from above 2.6 to 
below 2.6) will be a reduction in the difference in erythrocyte magnesium between genotypes. 
The normal reference range for erythrocyte magnesium is from 4.0 to 6.5 mg/dL. Thus, we 
expect treatment will increase the mean erythrocyte magnesium among the GA or AA group to 
the median mid-point of the normal range, (i.e. 5.25 mg/dL,) which is also the observed mean 
for the GG genotype group,  
Since the study has a 2 by 2 factorial design, we calculated the study power based on an 
ANOVA model which has two factors: treatment (treatment vs. placebo) and genotype (GG vs. 
GA and AA combined). There are 4 groups with 60 patients each by [CONTACT_91939]. At a 5% two -
sided significance level, a two -way analysis of variance will have 94% power to detect the main 
treatment effect, the main genotype effect, and their interaction, assuming that the common Table D3. Mean (standard deviations) for total erythrocyte

* There is only one patient possessing the AA for Ca/Mg ≤2.6 ; thus, no 
standard deviations can be estimated. We used the standard 
deviations for the GA genotype in the power calculation.    
 
Protocol Version  #: 34.0  98 
Protocol Date:  06-08-[ADDRESS_873422] deviation is 0.830 (average of 1.16 and 0.50). In this calculation, we expect both the 
treated GG genotype group and the treated A allele carrier (GA and AA combined) group will 
have mean total erythrocyte magnesium  of 5.25 mg/dL. If we conservatively use a standard 
deviation of 1.16, the power will be 71%. This power calculation is conducted using nQuery®, a 
commercial software.  
Base on our recently reported findings, the AA genotype w ould likely benefit the most from the 
magnesium supplementation . It is important to estimate the treatment effect within the three 
genotype groups and to compare the effects between the genotype groups. However, the AA 
genotype frequency is low (1.6%). We will be making every effort to enroll AA genotypes and 
expect to recruit 10 subjects during the 4 year recruiting period. Five each will be randomized to 
the treatment and the placebo group by [CONTACT_651306]. Due to the unequal 
number of subjects in the 2 by 3 ANOVA analysis, we conducted a simulation study to calculate 
the power for the interaction between the treatment and the GA genotype and the interaction 
between the treatment and the AA genotype. We used GG as the reference group. The power is 
68% and 65%, respectively, with alpha=0.05. These separate powers are lower than the 0.[ADDRESS_873423] deviation that has to be assumed by [CONTACT_651307]® software.    
Data analysis plan: This study will adopt a 2X2 factorial design. The first factor is genotype 
(GG vs. GA/AA or GG vs. GA vs. AA) and the second factor is intervention (magnesium 
treatment: modulating dietary Ca/Mg intake ratio versus placebo). The primary endpoints, which 
are all continuous variables, include apoptosis biomarkers (e.g. TUNEL and Bax), and 
expression of TRPM7, COX -2 (inflammation) and Ki -67 (proliferation index) , pMLKL  in 
colorectal mucosa . The secondary endpoints include serum level magnesium, serum vitamin D, 
and plasma concentration of C -reactive protein  as well as magnesium status (magnesium 
tolerance test), and urinary excretion of prostaglandin E 2 metabolite (PGE -M).  
Standard graphing and screening techniques  will be used to detect outliers and to ensure 
data accuracy.  Distributions of continuous outcomes will be assessed for normality. If normality 
is violated, proper data transformation will be applied or non -parametric analysis methods will 
be considered. Summary statistics for both continuous (mean ± standard deviation) and 
categorical variables (count and percent) will be provided by [CONTACT_651308]. Specific inferences on effects of interest will be made by [CONTACT_34055] a point 
estimate along with a 95% confidence interval and the p value. Hypotheses will be tested at the 
level of α=0.05. This data analysis plan will be carried out using statistical software SAS® (Cary, 
North Carolina) or statistical analysis package R ( R Development Core Team, 2008 ). These 
basic statistical rules will be applied to all stu dy aims.  
Two-way ANOVA or ANCOVA analyses  will be conducted to analyze the primary and 
secondary endpoints with intervention and genotype in the model (ANOVA) or other potential 
confounders including polyp type, size, and location for primary hyperplastic polyp or/and 
adenoma as well as body mass index, age, total energy intake, and intakes of other nutrients 
(average of six 24 -hour recalls) in the model (ANOCOVA). Overall intervention effect and 
genotype effect and their interactions will be tested.   
Univariate analyses  will be conducted for these ten primary and secondary end points 
(continuous variables) in relationship to magnesium treatment and placebo using between -

endpoints (primary+secondary) between magnesium supplement and placebo will be estimated 
for the genotype groups (GG, GA, AA and GA and AA combined) along with their 95%

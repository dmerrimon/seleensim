I. SPECIFIC AIMS  
 
Specific Aim 1: To develop a patient navigator (PN) program for lung screening for patients who are current 
smokers, aged 55 -77 years, potentially eligible for lung screening and are receiving care at community health 
centers (CHCs) affiliated with MGH.  
 
Specific Aim 2: To evaluate the effectiveness of the new lung screening PN program in improving screening 
rates and increasing use of tobacco cessation services in a randomized controlled trial.  
 
Specific Aim 3: To demonstrate that equity is maintained in rates of lung screening and in follow up of 
abnormal chest CT results, comparing eligible smokers from CHCs with eligible smokers from other practices 
within the MGH primary care network.  
 
Specific Aim 4:  To collect quantitative data about patient satisfaction with the navigators in the lung screening 
PN program  
 
Specific Aim 5: To explore CHC primary care providers opi[INVESTIGATOR_667966]. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
 
Though the incidence of lung cancer is similar to other common cancers such as breast and colorectal cancer, 
the large discrepancy in terms of mortality can be attributed in part to the widespread availability of screening 
and early detection for breast an d colorectal cancer. The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) sought to 
 
 
[ADDRESS_902350] (LDCT) compared to  chest radiography at baseline and then 
annually for [ADDRESS_902351] 
group (292 , 1.1%) compared with the ra diography group (190, 0.7%).[ADDRESS_902352] group compared to the radiology group (158 versus 70) along with 
similar numbers of late -stage cancers in each group. Follow up of the participants through the end of [ADDRESS_902353] screening of 
20%.1, [ADDRESS_902354],3, 4 the U.S. Preventi ve Servic es 
Task Force (USPSTF)  has issued new draf t guideline recommendations.4, [ADDRESS_902355] a 30 + pack -
years of smoking. In Feb ruary of [ADDRESS_902356] been evaluated , 
including patient navigation.7-9 Implemented in 1990 by [CONTACT_667972], patient navigation (PN) uses culturally and 
lingui stically tailored outreach workers to explore barriers to cancer care and navigate patients to obtain 
necessary care.[ADDRESS_902357] has not been widely used  at [LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (MGH) As a result, we 
have a unique opportunity to investigate how to promote screening in eligible, vulnerable patients and to 
prevent the creation of disparities in care.   
 
III. SUBJECT SELECTION  
 
According to internal MGH data from 2012, [ADDRESS_902358] scan in the prior 18 -months and/or had a diagnosis of lung 
cancer. Because of new Medicare guidelines we will o nly include patients that are aged 55 -77 years and 
additionally exclude patients that providers deem ineligible for lung cancer screening. We estimate the total 
number of patients eligible for our interventions to be around 1200.Our experience in prior PN colorectal 
cancer screening interventions is that one full -time navigator assigned 400 patients will be able to reach/work 
with [ADDRESS_902359] of care at MGH, 
its expansion to include lung screening is considered part of usual care.  
 
For Specifi c Aim 5, primary care physicians (PCPs) and nurse practitioners (NPs) from the community health 
centers with the PN program will be asked to complete a survey following the study period. There are 
approximately [ADDRESS_902360] ENROLLMENT  
 
For this study, we will use a newly developed TopCare smoking and lung screening registry. The registry uses 
the data from patient’s EMR regarding the smoking history and imaging (most recent chest CT) and it is daily  
 
 
[ADDRESS_902361]. 
Interventions may include: reminding the patient about the test, helpi[INVESTIGATOR_667967], insurance issues, 
transportation, and overcoming any other system barrier s as needed. After screening, PN will review the 
results. If the patient has an abnormal test result, the navigator will contact [CONTACT_102]’s primary care physician 
and help the patient obtain required follow -up.  
 
As a part of lung screening, the PN will assess the patient’s interest in quitting smoking. If the patient is 
interested in quitting, the PN will offer and help to connect the smoker to existing cessation resources in the 
community and CHCs and provide fol low-up contacts to monitor adherence to treatments. The PN will direct 
smokers to the 5 -call proactive telephone smoking cessation counseling provided free by [CONTACT_667973]. The 
PN will use a QuitWorks fax -referral system to make the Quitline referral; b y doing so, the smoker is eligible for 
two weeks of free nicotine patch or gum as well. The PN will also explain that pharmacologic treatment 
doubles quit rates when added to behavioral counseling, describe the available FDA -approved smoking 
cessation medi cations (nicotine replacement products, bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394], and varenicline), and refer to the PCP for a 
recommendation and prescription. The PN will monitor patient progress by [CONTACT_667974], followed by [CONTACT_62083] -up until the end of the study . If a patient declines  smoking cessation 
assistance, the PN will continue to inquire every three months if the patient has changed his/her mind about 
cessation and /or LDCT screening. Navigators will record information on every patient they contact [CONTACT_667975].   
 
For the patient satisfaction surveys in Specific Aim 4, patients will be contact[CONTACT_667976] m and have contact [CONTACT_667977]. We will also randomly select patients from the delayed intervention/control group to complete a 
satisfaction survey.  
 
For the PCP and nurse practitioner (NP) surveys in Specific Aim 5, PCPs and NPs will be provided a  paper 
survey at regular practice meetings by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_667968]. Providers that do 
not attend the practice meeting will receive the request to fill out the survey via interoffice mail or email.

 V.3. Patient Navigation for Lung Screening at MGH Community Health Centers  (Specific Aim 
1) 
 
In the first year of our study , we are develop ing a patien t navigator program for lung screening  for eligible 
patients – smokers aged 55 -77 years receiving care at the CHCs  affiliated with MGH. This include s: 
1. We will take advantage of a registry of smokers aged [ADDRESS_902363] and communication with providers. Training and supervision during the study period will be provided 
by [CONTACT_976], PN manager and MGH Chelsea HC community heath director.  
 
 V.4.  Randomized Clinical Trial (Specific Ai m 2) 
 
To test our hypothesis we will randomize eligible patients receiving care at CHC s to one of  two study groups : 
 
Early intervention  Usual care/delayed intervention  
400 patients will receive 1:1 PN to 
obtain lung screening and follow -up of 
abnormal results, as well as smoking 
cessation guidance  800 patients will receive usual care during the 1 -year study 
period. After the study period they will be offered 1:1 PN to 
obtain lung screening and follow -up of abnormal results as well 
as smoking cessation guidance  
 
Eligibility criteria:  
1. Inclusion criteria : adult patients aged 55 -77 years who are current cigarette smokers (according to an 
algorithm using EMR data), and receive care at one of the five MGH CHCs.  
2. Exclusion criteria : 1) patients who have previously received a diagnosis of lung cancer per EMR, 2) have 
undergone a chest CT within 18 months before enrollment, 3) are subsequently identified as having died 
prior to the study intervention 4) deemed by [CONTACT_667980] (PCOI) program  (Protocol # 2004P002796) .  
 
Using a newly developed TopCare smoking and lung s creening registry, we will identify smokers receiving care 
at MGH health centers who could be eligible for lung screening. We will e -mail primary care providers a list of 
their patients and ask them to notify us in a week if they do not want us to contact a patient and to provide a 
reason why they believe patient is not eligible for lung screening. The eligible patients will then be randomly 
allocated to the intervention or usual care groups. Patients randomly assigned to the intervention group will be 
eligible for PN, while patients randomly assigned to the control will receive usual care and be eligible for 
navigation after the one year period.  
 
Patient navigator intervention:  
 
PN program delivery: A letter about the program with lung screening  educational  materials used in usual 
clinical practice will be mailed to eligible patients. A week later, the PN will contact [CONTACT_667981]. The letters will be sent in stages. First, PN will use TopCare IT system to identif y 
patients who have appointment scheduled and send letters/contact [CONTACT_667982]. Patients 
who do not have appointments scheduled will be contact[CONTACT_667983] [ADDRESS_902364]. Further interventions may include: 
 
 
[ADDRESS_902365] the patient’s primary care physician and help the patient obtain 
required follow -up.  
 
As a part of lung screening, the PN will assess the patient’s interest in quitting smoking and provide 
motivational message about the importance of quitting despi[INVESTIGATOR_667969]. If the patient is 
interested in quitting, the PN will offer and help to connect the smoker to existing c essation resources in the 
community and CHCs and provide follow -up contacts to monitor adherence to treatments. The PN will refer 
smokers to the 5 -call proactive telephone smoking cessation counseling provided free by [CONTACT_667973]. The 
PN will use a Qui tWorks fax -referral system to make the Quitline referral; by [CONTACT_5634], the smoker is eligible for 
four weeks of free nicotine patch or gum as well. The PN will also offer refer to in -person counseling from CHC 
tobacco coach. Additionally, the PN will expla in that pharmacologic treatment doubles quit rates when added to 
behavioral counseling, describe the available FDA -approved smoking cessation medications, and refer to the 
PCP for a recommendation and prescription of bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_401825], which are ava ilable only by 
[CONTACT_50246]. The PN will monitor patient progress by [CONTACT_667984] [ADDRESS_902366] and Smoking Cessation  (Specific Aim 3)  
 
To determine whether the patient navigator program maintained equity in obtaining lung screening among 
smokers from CHCs compared to smokers from other MGH primary care practices, we will examine lung 
screening rates in the two study populations in the year prior to the intervention and after the 1 -year 
intervention period. Eligibility crite ria are the same as in Specific Aim 2, except the analysis will include patients 
in all MGH affiliated primary care practices stratified by [CONTACT_667985].  
 
Lung  screening rates prior to and after the 1 -year intervention period will be compared among eligibl e patients 
receiving care at one of the five MGH CHCs (all patients and subgroup of those who received the early 
intervention) and eligible patients from all other MGH practices . 
 
Patients will be identified using existing electronic systems developed by t he MGH PCOI  program (Protocol # 
2004P002796) .). 
 
V.6.  Patient Satisfaction Surveys  (Specific Ai m 4) 
 
We plan to collect quantitative data about patient satisfaction with the navigators in Lung screening patient 
navigation (PN) program.  We will ask patients who have been randomized to PN early intervention arm to 
complete two validated surveys: "Satisfaction with Interpersonal Relationships with Navigator (PSN -I)" and 
"Satisfaction with Logistical Aspects of Navigation (PSN -L)". We will also ask both  the PN early intervention 
group and the delayed intervention group to complete the Short -form Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire (PSQ -
18). These surveys will provide information about patient satisfaction with the PN program and information 
about the impa ct of the PN program on overall patient satisfaction with medical care.   
 
Patients will be contact[CONTACT_667986]. Those intereste d in participation may then 
complete the surveys over the telephone or they may elect to complete the surveys in person and will be met 
by [CONTACT_667987]. Patient interviews will last approximately 20 minutes in 
duratio n (see attached surveys and interview guide). Bilingual research assistants or trained interpreters will be 
available to conduct surveys if patients are not native English speakers. Exclusion and inclusion criteria are the 
same as Specific Aim 2.   
 
 
 
7 
 V.7.  Provider Surveys (Specific Aim 5)  
Following the completion of the randomized trial of the lung cancer screening PN program in current smokers 
receiving primary care at MGH CHCs, we plan to survey primary care providers to assess their opi[INVESTIGATOR_667970] e with the program with a short [ADDRESS_902367] any personal 
or demographic data. All providers from the participating practices will be el igible to receive the survey.  
 
 
 
VI. BIOSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
  
 VI.1 Primary outcomes  (intention -to-treat)  
 
Percentage of patients assigned to the intervention and control groups who had at least one chest CT 
(according to billing and EMR data) during the  1-year study period.  
 
 VI.[ADDRESS_902368] (according to billing and EMR data) during the 1 -
year study period, comparing patients contact[CONTACT_667988] (“as trea ted” 
analysis) vs. all patients in control group.  
2. Percentage of patients in intervention vs. control groups who had at least one lung CT screening stratified 
by [CONTACT_667979], race, age (<> 65 years) and practice site. (subgroup analysis)  
3. Of patients who se initial chest CT generated a radiologist’s recommendation for early interval follow -up, the 
percentage who received the recommended follow -up of  in timely manner. The timeliness of care is 
defined by [CONTACT_271486]’s recommendation plus additional 30 days . For recommended biopsy/PET scan we 
chose [ADDRESS_902369]; however 
recommendations are similar to Lung -RADS. At the end of one -year trial a blinded research assistant will 
review the electronic medical records of patients who had a chest CT during stu dy period. The dates of 
imaging will be confirmed by [CONTACT_667989].  
4. Mean time to follow -up of abnormal results, comparing intervention and control groups.  
5. Tobacco treatment use: Percentage of patients, comparing intervention and control groups, who during the 
1-year study period had any of the following:  
o referral to MA Quitline as determined by [CONTACT_1962]’ QuitWorks data or referral scanned in EHR  
o smoking cessation medication prescribed in EHR (nicotine patch, gum. lozenge, inhaler, nasal spray 
or bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394], or varenicline) during the study period  
o referral to in -person counseling from CHC -based  tobacco coach –documented in EHR  
6. Percentage of patients, comparing intervention and control groups, who have a status of former or 
nonsmoker entered in coded field of EHR at the visit closest to the date of 1 year follow -up.  
7. Percentage of patients in intervention group who are reached by [CONTACT_667990] (process measures)  
 
AIM [ADDRESS_902370] in the subsequent 1 year, 
comparing patients receiving care at CHCs with patients from all other practices within the MGH primary care 
network.  
 
 
 
 
8 
  VI.3. Analytic Methods  
 
AIM 2:  
We will examine differences in lung screening rates using chi -square tests.   
The comparisons include (1) between intervention and control groups (intention -to-treat analysis), and (2) 
between patients contact[CONTACT_667991] (“as -treated” analysis).  
An expl oratory subgroup analysis will compare lung screening rates between intervention and control groups 
stratified by [CONTACT_667979], race, age (<> 65 years), practice site and other factors.   
Furthermore, we will use logistic regression models to examine pr edictors of lung screening, including patient, 
provider, and practice characteristics.  
In addition to comparing the percentage that completed recommended test in a timely manner between 
intervention and control group using a chi -square test, we will use s urvival analysis techniques to compare time 
to completion between intervention and control groups.  
We will also use chi -square tests to compare the percentage with referral to MA Quitline, prescription to 
smoking cessation medications, referral to in pers on counseling from CHC tobacco coach, and documented 
smoking status in EHR between intervention and control groups.  
For the intervention group, we will document process measures (percentage reached by [CONTACT_667992]) and present with 95%CI’s.  
 
AIM3:  
We will use a chi -square test to compare lung screening rates between patients receiving care at CHCs to 
patients from other practices within the MGH primary care network during the one -year study period.  
 
Aim4:  
We will use chi -square tests and/or t -tests as appropriate to compare patient satisfaction between navigated 
and n on-navigated patients.  
 
 VI.4. Sample Size Calculations  
 
We hypothesize that the navigator program will incr ease lung screening in the i ntervention group by [CONTACT_2669] 
5%. With a total sample size of [ADDRESS_902371] 88% power to detect a 5% difference . From our prior experience, a full time navigator with 
the assistance of two part -time interpreters/navigators can reach about [ADDRESS_902372] in lung screening . For some individuals this 
information may cause distress if it is something they are not interested in doing or if they do not think it 
accurately reflects their particular situation. This information may also not be up  to date for all patients. If an 
individual believes this is the case, he/she will be provided information about whom to contact [CONTACT_667993]. A standard system is in place as part of usual care to input this information into the patient’s elect ronic 
medical record to communicate this information. All contact [CONTACT_98995], including those in the control group, 
will be based on current MGH Primary Care guidelines for usual  care.  
 
Specific Aim 4: There are no foreseeable risks from participating i n this quantitative interview study except the 
time commitment required and the possibility of psychological discomfort in discussing the subject of cancer 
prevention.  Demographic information will be obtained from electronic medical record. All data will b e stored on 
password -protected computers. Personal health information will be de -identified during data collection. All 
identifying patient information will be deleted prior to analysis and data will only be presented in aggregate.  
 
 
 
9 
 Specific Aim 5: There are no foreseeable risks from completing this survey. No personal or demographic 
information will be collected. Providers may decline to complete the survey if they wish.  
 
 
 
VIII. POTENTIAL BENEFITS  
 
Patients may benefit from the intervention if it results  in smoking cessation and lung  screening . Such screening 
may decrease the individual’s risk of being diagnosed with cancer, or if diagnosed it may be at a stage where 
treatment is more effective . 
 
If the intervention is effective in improving care, resourc es may be expanded to reach more vulnerable patients 
across the primary care network in a timelier manner.  
 
Specific Aim 4: There is no direct benefit to subjects from participating in this additional portion of the study. 
The study is not specifically des igned to facilitate patients having cancer screening; rather, it simply seeks to 
explore patients’ experience with current PN programs. The knowledge gained from this study of patient's 
experience and satisfaction with PN programs will guide quality improv ements of patient care at MGH by 
[CONTACT_667994].   
 
 
IX. MONITORING AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
 
All study personnel are experienced clinical investigators and have completed required IRB -related programs. 
Study invest igators and research personnel have extensively used data sources as part of clinical quality 
improvement and research activities that will be employed in this study. Regular meetings involving study 
investigators and staff will be held to ensure the valid ity, integrity, and timeliness of the data, and adherence to 
the IRB -approved protocol and Partners  Human Research Committee policies.  
 
IX.1. Data Safety and Monitoring  
 
Because potential risks to patients are minimal, patients will receive standard care, and the period of 
intervention short, we do not plan to employ a Data Safety Monitoring Board and have chosen not to employ 
formal interim analyses or guidelines for early termination of this short trial. In the event that adverse events 
are found to occur  more often in either study group, we will alert the Partners HealthCare System IRB as soon 
as we are aware and take further action as needed.  
 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_667971].  
 
IX.2. Privacy and Confidentiality  
 
All data will be stored on password -protected computers, and personal health information will be de -identified 
during data collec tion and only decoded as necessary to link back to patient outcome information. Only IRB 
approved study personnel will perform and have access to confidential patient data. All data sources used as 
part of this study are maintained by [CONTACT_667995]. All MGH 
patients are informed that patient data may be used for clinical research. All identifying patient information will 
be deleted prior to analysis and data will only be presented in aggregate. Any printed forms with p atient data 
will be stored in a locked cabinet or shredded.

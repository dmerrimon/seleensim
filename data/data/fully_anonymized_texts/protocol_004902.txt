NIH Definition of a Clinical Trial:  
A research study in which one or more human subjects are prospec tively assigned to 
one or more interventions. An "intervention" is defined as a manipulation of the subject 
or subject’s environment for the purpose of modifying one or more health-related 
biomedical or behavioral processes and/or endpoints. Examples include: drugs/small 
molecules/compounds; biologics; devices; procedures (e.g., surgi cal techniques); 
delivery systems (e.g., telemedicine, face-to-face interviews); strategies to change 
health-related behavior (e.g., diet, cognitive therapy, exercise, development of new 
PROTOCOL TITLE: Pi[INVESTIGATOR_481760] 2 of 35  Version Date: 5/14/2019  habits); treatment strategies; prevention strategies; and, diagnostic  strategies (which 
may include placebo or other control) to evaluate the effects of those interventions on  
health-related biomedical or behavioral outcomes.  
Use the following four questions to determine the difference between a clinical 
study and a clinical trial:        
 Does the study involve human participants?  Yes    No 
 Are the participants prospectively assigned to an intervention?  Yes    No 
 Is the study designed to evaluate the effect of the intervention on the 
participants?  Yes    No  
  Is the effect being evaluated a health-related biomedical or behavioral outcome? 
 Yes    No 
 
Note that if the answers to the 4 questions are yes, your study meets the NIH definition 
of a clinical trial, even if…  
• You are studying healthy participants  
• Your study does not have a comparison group (e.g., placebo or control)  
• Your study is only designed to assess the pharmacokinetics, safety, and/or 
maximum tolerated dose of an investigational drug 
• Your study is utilizing a behavioral intervention  
 
If yes  to all 4 questions , please confirm that the research team is familiar with and 
agrees to comply with the investigator requirement to register the study on the 
ClinicalTrials.gov database. Additionally, the approved consent document(s) must be 
uploaded to the ClinicalTrials.gov database     Yes    No

including engagement in care. Feelings of shame are commonly experienced with 
stigmatized behaviors, such as substance misuse, and may be particularly strong among 
pregnant women who misuse substances. Rates  of opi[INVESTIGATOR_481762], particularly in New Mexico, leading to negative health outcomes for mothers and fetuses. Shame has been found to decrease these patients’ willingness to 
attend and engage in care. Although a theor etical model is available to guide 
interventions to reduce shame, it has not been tested empi[INVESTIGATOR_3675]. In the current study, 
we seek to evaluate the preliminary effectiveness and feasibility of a brief Shame 
Resilience Intervention among women seeking care in UNM’s Milagro program, a prenatal medical clinic for opi[INVESTIGATOR_481763]. This research has the potential 
to significantly improve public health by [CONTACT_57148] a tool to reduce barriers to care.
 
  
The specific aims of this project are as follows:  
  
Aim 1: Assess the feasibility of study methods (recruitment and retention), intervention fidelity, and treatment satisfaction.
 
We will track rates of participation in the study as well as retention at follow -up. All 
intervention sessions will be audio-recorded and rated using the Motivational 
Interviewing Treatment Integrity tool. Participants will provide quantitative ratings of 
treatment satisfaction. In addition, a random sample of ten participants will be invited to complete qualitative interviews on treatment satisfaction.
 
Hypotheses : The study sample will be recruited during the study timeline and a > 85% 
follow -up rate will be attained. Coded intervention samples will meet benchmarks for 
proficiency on a validated treatment fidelity rating tool. Participants will report high 
satisfaction with the intervention.  
  
Aim 2: Examine the preliminary effectiveness of the intervention on well-being, 
shame, shame resilience, and treatment attendance. We administer a battery of 
validated questionnaires  at baseline and 1-month follow -up. We will analyze within-group 
changes in effectiveness outcome variables. Standardized measures of effect size will 
be calculated.  
Hypotheses : The intervention will lead to significant improvements in well -being, shame, 
shame resilience, and treatment attendance.  
2. Background 
2.1 While the emotion of guilt entails “feeling bad” about a choice, shame involves the 
internalization of this emotion to a feeling of “I am bad.”[ADDRESS_618815] of shame on willingness to report accurately, available data 
suggests that more 5% of women report use drugs during pregnancy.

stigmatized health issues, such as HIV/AIDS, depression, eating disorders, and 
domestic violence.[ADDRESS_618818] of shame on health outcomes, by [CONTACT_481778].17 These i nclude:  
1)    Seeking to Understand Shame - Shame is an emotion that is often mistaken for other 
emotions. Shame can be difficult to identify and process, as the feelings of shame is often misattributed to other emotional processes.
18  This behavior involved identifying 
shame as well as shame triggers.  
2)    Practicing Critical Awareness –  This behavior serves to improve understanding and 
involves efforts to normalize and contextualize the thoughts coming from the shame response and process them.
 
3)    Reaching Out –  This behavior involves disclosing shame to others and asking for 
empathy from a support network.  
4)    Speaking Shame –  This behavior involves speaking openly about the experience of 
shame and leading to desensitization and externalization.  
Shame Resilience Theory was developed through qualitative interviewing techniques17 
and has not been translated into a replicable behavioral health intervention or 
qualitatively evaluated to determine its impact on health outcomes.  
One means by [CONTACT_481779] a widely utilized and evidence-based 
communication strategy known as Motivational Interviewing (MI).

a collaborative, goal -oriented style of communication with particular 
attention to the language of change. It is designed to strengthen personal 
motivation for and commitment to a specific goal by [CONTACT_481780] 
a person’s own reasons for change within an atmosphere of acceptance 
and compassion.21 MI is  often implemented as a brief intervention in

Recruitment: Milagro patients presenting at the Southeast Heights and FCM 
Clinic s will approached in the waiting room or an exam room  following triage and 
asked if they would like to voluntarily screen for a confidential study. Patients 
who meet eligibility criteria will be informed about the study and their option to 
voluntarily participate in the study. Screening will be done through REDCap and 
completed screening forms will be maintained with other confidential study forms. 
Consent: Informed consent will be obtained from each participant before 
completing any research procedures. Each participant will read a document 
outlining the purpose and content of the researc h. Participants will fully 
understand what is expected of them throughout the research process. 
Participants will be made aware of potential risks, benefits, and incentives for 
participating in the initial meeting as well as the follow -up. During the consent 
process, phone numbers and other forms of contact [CONTACT_481782] -up data collection. 
Baseline Assessment:  Data will be entered directly into REDC ap (Research 
Electronic Data Capture) software via a tablet device. REDCap is a secure, web-
based application designed to support data capture for research studies 
providing: 1) an intuitive interface for validated data entry; 2) audit trails for 
tracking data manipulation and export procedures; 3) automated export 
procedures for seamless data downloads to common statistical packages; and 4) 
procedures for importing data from external sources. REDCap is secure and 
HIPAA compliant and available for use to all UNM HSC faculty and staff.  
Baseline Assessment Questions can be found in the section on study forms. 
Questions are self-report and may be completed individually by [CONTACT_481783] a study staff member. Questions will include demographi c 
variables, including age and ethnicity . Contact [CONTACT_481784].  
Brief-Intervention: Twenty participants will receive a brief, MI-Guided Shame 
Resilience intervention. Participants will attend a one-on-one intervention with the research coordinator. The intervention will be [ADDRESS_618831] will help guide the conversation and incorporate 
shame resilience into the participants' own life.  
All participants will receive the brief-intervention as there currently no alternative 
treatments or procedures for issues of shame.  
Follow -up Data Collection: Telephone or in-person follow -up surveys at one 
month after receiving the intervention. In-person follow -ups will occur at a 
patients’ scheduled visit to the clinic. Data collection will be surveys completed 
on a tablet device for privacy and security. If follow -up occurs over the phone, the 
interventionist will work with the participant to establish an adequate time, during the initial v isit. 
12.3 We are not collecting existing or prospective data.  
PROTOCOL TITLE: Pi[INVESTIGATOR_481760] 10 of 35  Version Date: 5/14/[ADDRESS_618832]. The tool was developed by [CONTACT_481785].  
2.  The Shame Inventory 32,33 is a two-part survey that looks measures an individual’s 
past month experience of shame. It provides an empi[INVESTIGATOR_481768]. 
Questions include items such as: How often do you typi[INVESTIGATOR_481769]? What is 
the intensity or sever ity of the shame you typi[INVESTIGATOR_68327]? To what extent does 
shame negatively affect your life? Response options are all on a 5-point Likert scale.  
3.  The Shame Resilience Measure is a psychometrically valid measure examining 
healthy shame behaviors in response to potentially shame inducing events. Participants 
are asked to select from response options that are more or less consistent with the 
Shame Resilience Theory, including communication and self- compassion, negative self-
talk, and avoidance, on a 4-point Likert scale.34 
4.  The Willingness to Communicate about Health34,35 is a survey made of 10 items 
that are rated on a 5-point Likert scale. It assesses individual’s willingness to communicate to both providers and non-providers about their health. High scores 
indicate a greater willingness to communicate. This scale is bas ed off the Willingness to 
Communicate scale (WTC), a previously standardized scale, and demonstrated a Cronbach reliability coefficient of .91.    
5. The Trauma Checklist Adult39 (Modified)  is a three part –  self-report 
measure of symptomatic distress in adults arising from traumatic experiences. It 
measures aspects of post-traumatic stress as well as other symptoms found in 
some traumatized individuals.’ s children and their families. In our analysis we are 
only interested in patient symptoms  and are not asking them to report specific 
traumatic situations. Our modified checklist only includes the second and third 
part which asks about symptoms . 
    
 
13 Data Analysis 
13.3 Descriptive statistics will be used to calculate rates of recruitment and retention, 
treatment fidelity scores, and quantitative treatment satisfaction. Detailed process notes 
regarding any unexpected study complications will be kept and analyzed using 
standardized qualitative methods.  Our qualitative analytic approach for open ended 
satisfaction questions will follow Gläser and Laudel’s framework for theory -driven 
qualitative content analysis to identify categories and patterns related to the main 
domains  of the questions asked.36 Notes will be reviewed for systematic themes and 
PROTOCOL TITLE: Pi[INVESTIGATOR_481760] 11 of 35  Version Date: 5/14/2019  subthemes, and coded inductively. The extractions will be reduced, refined, 
summarized, and catalogued. To further explore patterns within each theme or sub-
theme, data will be examined and organized for coherence, and further interpretations 
will be developed.  
To address Aim 1: We will conduct a qualitative analysis to assess the feasibility of providing brief shame resilience training to the Milagro population. The feasibility of 
study methods and satisfaction with the intervention will be measured using the following measures.
 
1.  Recruitment Feasibility  will include the number of patients approached, the 
proportion who agree to be screened, eligibility rates, and consent rates.  
2.  Retention Feasibility  will include rates of baseline completion, intervention 
completion, and follow -up rates at 1- month.  
3.  Treatment Fidelity: Fidelity to the intervention will be measured by [CONTACT_481786] 
[IP_ADDRESS] MITI is a one-pass behavioral coding system designed to measure treatment 
fidelity for motivational interviewing.  It can be used for clinician training or as a quality 
check in clinical trials.  The instrument has proficiency cut-points for a range of interventionist behaviors.
 
4.  The Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire will measure treatment satisfaction 
using five, Likert style questions focused on quality and delivery.[ADDRESS_618833] abstraction.
 
To address Aim 2: Within group changes in targeted outcomes including well -being, 
shame, shame resilience, willingness to communicate about health, and treatment 
attendance. We will analyze the within-group data using one sample t-tests comparing 
baseline and follow -up means for each measure. In addition, we will calculate 
standardized effect sizes comparing baseline and follow -up scores, using Cohen’s d.37,38 
Exploratory analyses will compare all measures using a correlation matrix at both baseline and follow -up, particularly looki ng at the interaction between shame resilience 
and each measure.
 
 
Fidelity and Quality : The research coordinator will meet with the study PI, a clinical 
psychologist, weekly for clinical supervision during the intervention phase of the study.

18 Risks to Subjects 
18. 1 Participants may experience discomfort when talking about 
engagement in a stigmatized behavior (shame surrounding opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441]) 
during intervention. In addition, potential psychological distress may also 
be caused by [CONTACT_481787][INVESTIGATOR_424752]. Lastly, 
inadvertent disclosure of confidential data to non -study staff could be 
damaging to patient’s reputation. Extra care will be taken to protect 
information during waiting room recruitment. Researchers will make no 
mention of shame behaviors  or screening results in the waiting room. 
During telephone assessments, we will encourage participants to 
complete the brief follow -up call in a private location and explicitly ask 
about ability / comfort to discuss sensitive issues prior to commencing each assessment.  
18.2  We are not aware of any procedures with unforeseeable risks.  
18.3 We are not aware of any procedures with risks to embryos or fetuses.  
18.4 We do not anticipate risks to others who are not subjects.  
18.5 Steps to ensure the confidentiality of data are described above. In the 
case that participants become psychologically distressed by [CONTACT_481788], referral to the clinic’s behavioral health care providers is available. 
Additionally , participants will be given the information for the Agora Crisis C enter, 
a free crisis hotline, which can provide further support and resources. If a participant does experience psychological distress we wil l follow up with them 
over the phone the following day to ensure they are alright.

services will be approached by a research team member in the waiting or exam room. The research team m ember will ask the patient if they are interested in 
learning whether they are eligible to participate in a study. Interested patients will be given a brief self-administered screening instrument (see Screening Form)  
assessing inclusion criteria. Patients who do not meet inclusion criteria will be 
informed that they are not eligible and thanked for their willingness to be screened. Participants who do meet inclusion criteria will be informed they are 
eligible for participation. Patients will be informed of eligibility or ineligibility once 
they are in the exam room.   
20.2 Potential subjects will be individuals who are attending the clinic for 
regularly scheduled medical visits or for behavioral health screening. No chart review or referral process will be used to recruit participants.

prisoners and immune from arbitrary intervention by [CONTACT_74576]. Unless justification is provided, control subjects must be 
selected randomly from the group of available prisoners who meet the 
characteristics needed for that particular research project  
      
d) The information is presented in language which is understandable to 
the subject population  
      
e) Adequate assurance exists that parole boards will not take into 
account a prisoner's participation in the research in making decisions 
regarding parole, and each prisoner is clearly informed in advance 
that participation in the research will have no effect on his or her parole 
      
f) When appropriate, adequate provision has been made for follow up 
examination or care after research participation, taking into account 
the varying lengths of individual prisoners' sentences, and for 
informing participants of this fact

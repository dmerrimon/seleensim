Document Version Date Summary and Rationale for Changes
Protocol amendment 5 08 March 2022 •Enrollment of study participants was 
terminated with fewer study participants enrolled than originally planned due to enrollment challenges into a placebo-controlled trial as a result of universal recommendations for COVID-19 vaccination of pregnant women and the increased global availability of COVID-19 vaccines.
•Modified the primary immunogenicity 
objectives and estimands from 
hypothesis testing analysis to descriptive analysis as a result of the significantly reduced final number of study participants enrolled than originally planned.
•Modified an exploratory 
immunogenicity estimand by [CONTACT_837385] 1 month after delivery for crossover participants because there is no COVID-19 surveillance for these participants after 1 month after delivery.
•Modified appropriate statistical sections 
due to updates to the primary immunogenicity objectives and estimands.
•Updated Sections 2.2.[ADDRESS_1162868] 2021 •Added procedures in Section 8.14 to 
capture data pertaining to myocarditis and pericarditis in response to commitments made to CBER.

Document Version Date Summary and Rationale for Changes
•Updated a typographical error in the 
SoA regarding the need to collect AE information during the 1-week postdelivery follow-up call.
•Clarified that, if pregnancy outcome 
information was not obtained at the time 
of delivery, updated information should be provided at Visit 6.
•Added a modifier to inclusion 
criterion [ADDRESS_1162869] in Mozambique, so that the population is reachable based on location despi[INVESTIGATOR_837347].
•Removed the collection of CD4 count 
and HIV viral load at Visit 101 in Sections 1.3.2 and 8.17.1 since this is duplicate information and will already be collected at Visit 7 in Section 1.3.1.
•Added “chills” to the definition of 
confirmed COVID-19 in maternal participants in Section 8.1.1.
Protocol amendment 2 02 March 2021 •Sections 1.3.1 and 1.3.2: expanded the 
1-month postdelivery visit window by 1 week to allow for potential earlier vaccination of BNT162b2 to participants originally randomized to receive placebo.
•Section 1.3.3: removed “equivalent visit 
number for maternal participants” from the Infant SoA since this will differ for maternal participants originally randomized to placebo who will go on to receive BNT162b2 at 1 month after delivery and follow a different SoA.
•Section 2.3: added a sentence to clarify 
that the protocol is a PASS.

Document Version Date Summary and Rationale for Changes
•Section 5.1.1: corrected the calculation 
of GA in the third trimester, replacing “second trimester” with “third trimester,” and updated the discrepancy of days between the LMP-determined GA from >10 to >21 days.
•Removed references to 
thumbprinting the ICD, since 
illiterate participants will not be enrolled from certain regions.
•Clarified in Section 8.2.2 that field 
workers would be used in the case of poor network connection for e-diary completion.
•Sections 5.1.1, 8.17.3, and 10.4: added 
criteria for inclusion of maternal participants with stable HIV, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C in Phase 3.
•Updated the Objectives, Estimands, and 
Endpoints to add a safety objective for the first 600 randomized maternal participants to support interim analysis/submission report.
•Per CBER feedback, updated the 
term “NI” to “immunobridging” todescribe the immunogenicity comparison between nonrandomized populations in the protocol.
•Added a footnote to clarify that 
HIV-infected participants will not be included in analyses of the objectives. Analyses among HIV-infected women and their infants will be summarized separately.

•Clarified that a study pause may not 
prevent administration of Dose 2 for enrolled participants.
•Modified stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877] 7 to include 
a trigger of preterm premature 
rupture of membranes.
•Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877] 4: removed 
assessment of laboratory abnormalities, as these data are not collected in this study.
•Section 8.11.1, Visit 1: removed the 
requirement of a repeat fetal scan to clarify that an earlier scan done 
at≥18 weeks瀠GA can be used to 
confirm singleton pregnancy and rule 
out fetal anomalies.
•Section 8.16: clarified that exclusion 
criterion 2 is not met if the participant meets the criteria for confirmed COVID-19 with or without symptoms and can receive Vaccination 2.
•Section 8.17: to align with current 
recommendations, investigators may 
exercise judgment on review of inclusion and exclusion criteria ahead of vaccination with BNT162b2 for participants who originally received placebo.
•Sections 8.3.1 and 8.3.7: inserted 
language to clarify that potential COVID-19/MIS-C illnesses and their sequelae that are consistent with the clinical endpoint definition should not 
be recorded as AEs.

Document Version Date Summary and Rationale for Changes
•Updated Section 2.3, Benefit-Risk 
Assessment, to include data from the DART studies.
•In line with current recommendations, 
removed the requirement to discontinue 
study intervention because of a diagnosis of COVID-19 during the study.
•Added the requirement to record 
antipyretic medication in the e-diary during the 7-day vaccination period, as this was omitted in error.
•Added editorial changes in the 
document to clarify where field workers/site staff may be required to call/visit maternal participants at home (applicable to regions where illiterate participants may be enrolled).
•Clarified that participants originally 
randomized to placebo who go on to receive BNT162b2 at 1 month after delivery will not participate in COVID-19 surveillance.
•Clarified that AEs will be collected from 
the signing of the ICD to 1 month after Vaccination 4 (Visit 103) for those maternal participants who originally received placebo and who go on to receive BNT162b2 at 1 month after delivery.

1.1. SynopsisShort Title: A Phase 2/3 Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, and Immunogenicity of a 
SARS-CoV-2 RNA Vaccine Candidate (BNT162b2) Against COVID-19 in Healthy Pregnant Women 18 Years of Age and Older
RationaleIn December 2019, a pneumonia outbreak of unknown cause occurred in Wuhan, China.  
In January 2020, it became clear that a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was the underlying cause.  Later in January, the genetic sequence of the 2019-nCoV became available to the WHO and public (MN908947.3), and the virus was categorized in the Betacoronavirus
subfamily.  By [CONTACT_322113], the phylogenetic tree revealed a closer relationship to SARS virus isolates than to another coronavirus infecting humans, the MERS virus. SARS-CoV-[ADDRESS_1162874] importance.
BNT162b2 is a SARS-CoV-2–RNA-LNP vaccine based on a platform of modRNA with 
blunted innate immune sensor–activating capacity and augmented expression encoding the
P2 S.
This study will describe the safety of BNT162b2 in pregnant women and their infants. It will 
also assess the immunogenicity of BNT162b2 in pregnant women, the transfer of antibody to their infants, and the kinetics of antibody transfer in the infant.

Overall Design
This will be a global Phase 2/3, randomized, placebo-controlled, observer-blind study 
evaluating the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of 30 μg of BNT162b2 or placebo 
administered in 2 doses, 21 days apart, in approximately 350 healthy pregnant women 18 years of age or older vaccinated at 24 to 34 weeks’ gestation. Participants will be randomized 1:1 to receive BNT162b2 or placebo (saline).

Page 21The Phase 2 portion of the study will include approximately 200 pregnant women
randomized 1:1 to receive BNT162b2 or placebo (saline) at 27 to 34 weeks’ gestation. The IRC will review safety data through 7 days after the second dose for all Phase 2 participants.
The Phase 3 portion of this study will assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of 
BNT162b2 among pregnant women enrolled at 24 to 34 weeks’ gestation. Phase [ADDRESS_1162880] been enrolled in Phase 2.
Maternal participants who originally received placebo will receive BNT162b2 at defined 
time points as part of the study.
Number of ParticipantsApproximately 200 healthy pregnant women will be enrolled in the Phase 2 portion of the 
study. Approximately 150 healthy pregnant women will be enrolled in the Phase 3 portion.
Intervention Groups and DurationThis study will evaluate a 2-dose (separated by 21 days) schedule of 30 μg of the 
investigational BNT162b2 RNA vaccine candidate (BNT162 RNA-LNP vaccine utilizing modRNA and encoding the P2 S) for active immunization against COVID-19.
Healthy pregnant women will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive a 2-dose schedule of 
either:
•BNT162b2 (BNT162 RNA-LNP vaccine utilizing modRNA and encoding the P2 S) at a 
dose of 30 μg OR
•Normal saline solution for injection (0.9% NaCl injection).
Each maternal participant will participate in the study for approximately up to 10 months 
depending on the vaccine group to which she was randomized. Her infant will participate in the study for approximately 6 months. The study duration will be approximately 14 months.
Data Monitoring Committee or Other Independent Oversight CommitteeThe study will utilize an IRC, an internal [COMPANY_007] committee that will be used during the 
Phase 2 portion of the study to closely monitor safety.
The study will include stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004], which may result in a pause to study vaccination 
followed by a review and recommendation by [CONTACT_26732].

The primary safety objective will be evaluated by [CONTACT_407384], systemic events, AEs, and SAEs, for each vaccine group.  Descriptive summary statistics will include counts and percentages of participants with the indicated endpoint and the associated Clopper-Pearson 95% CIs. A 3-tier approach will be used to summarize AEs.The AEs, including SAEs, reported in the open-label follow-up period will be summarized separately from those reported during the blinded follow-up period for maternal participants. The safety objective related to infants born to maternal participants, including birth outcomes, AEs, SAEs, and AESIs, will be evaluated in a similar way.
There are 2 primary immunogenicity objectives, one for participants without evidence of 
SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, and the other for participants with and without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection; each will be evaluated by [CONTACT_837389]-CoV-2 neutralizing titers induced by [CONTACT_118110] T162b2 at 1 month after Dose 2 in maternal 
participants and in a group of randomly selected nonpregnant women within the same age group from the C4591001 study. GMRs will be provided along with associated 2-sided 95% CIs.
Other immunogenicity objectives will be evaluated descriptively by [CONTACT_214333]/GMCs and 
GMFRs of full-length S-binding IgG levels and/or SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing titers and associated 2-sided 95% CIs.
The secondary efficacy objectives are to describe VE against the confirmed COVID-19 
illness during the blinded follow-up period, which is defined as VE = 100 × (1 – IRR). IRR is calculated as the ratio of first confirmed COVID-[ADDRESS_1162881].The incidence rates of confirmed COVID-19 and asymptomatic infection per 
1000 person-years of follow-up in maternal participants after their receipt of BNT162b2 throughout the study will be provided with the associated 2-sided 95% CIs.
The incidence rate of confirmed COVID-19 and incidence rate of confirmed MIS-C in infant
participants, and associated 2-sided 95% CIs, will also be provided according to the vaccine group to which the maternal participants were randomized.

also assess the immunogenicity of BNT162b2 in pregnant women, the transfer of antibody to their infants, and the kinetics of antibody transfer in the infant.
2.2.1. Clinical Overview
Prior to this study, clinical data from BNT162b2 established a favorable safety profile 
characterized by [CONTACT_59623], localized, and transient effects. Study C4591001 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) is 
an ongoing Phase 1/2/3 trial in ~46,000 participants designed to generate safety, tolerability, 
immunogenicity, and efficacy data from a novel RNA-based vaccine candidate.
18  The trial is 
being conducted in a heterogeneous study population: eligible healthy participants ≥12 years 
of age, including those participants with stable chronic medical conditions, including HIV-, HCV-, and HBV-positive participants.  The study consists of 2 parts: Phase 1: to identify the preferred vaccine candidate (BNT162b1 or BNT162b2) and dose level (10 μg, 20 μg, 30 μg, 
or 100 μg [for BNT162b1]); Phase 2/3: an expanded-cohort and efficacy part for the selected 
vaccine candidate (BNT162b2).

Immunogenicity substantially increased following the second dose of vaccine.  BNT162b2 induces a strong antigen-specific Th1-skewed CD4+ response and a strong antigen-specific CD8+ response.  BNT162b2 was selected from the Phase 1 part of the study based on theoverall safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity.

fatigue (62.9%), headache (55.1%), muscle pain (38.3%), chills (31.9%), joint pain (23.6%), and fever (14.2%); severe adverse reactions occurred in 0.0% to 4.6% of participants, were more frequent after Dose 2 than after Dose 1, and were generally less frequent in participants ≥55 years of age ( ≤2.8%) as compared to younger participants ( ≤4.6%).  The 
frequency of SAEs was low ( <0.5%), without meaningful imbalances between study arms. 
Lymphadenopathy was observed in 0.3% of vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_837354] <0.1% of 
those who received placebo.  Otherwise, there were no notable patterns or numerical imbalances between vaccine groups for specific categories of nonserious AEs (including other neurologic, neuroinflammatory, and thrombotic events) that would suggest a causal relationship to BNT162b2.  With the exception of more frequent, generally mild to moderate 
reactogenicity in participants <55 years of age, the safety profile of BNT162b2 was generally 
similar across age groups, sexes, ethnic and racial groups, participants with or without medical comorbidities, and participants with or without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection at enrollment.
19
Numerous COVID-19 vaccines are currently in development globally, and several candidate COVID-19 vaccines (eg, mRNA vaccines and adenovirus-vectored vaccines expressing the S protein) have been shown to be efficacious in the prevention of COVID-19 in clinical studies and are now available under temporary or emergency authorizations.

On 22 September 2021, based on safety and immunogenicity data from approximately 
300 immunocompetent adult booster-dose recipi[INVESTIGATOR_227914] C4591001, the FDA issued the EUA for a single booster dose of BNT162b2 30 μg for 1) individuals 65 years of age and 
older; 2) individuals 18 through 64 years of age at high risk of severe COVID-19; and 3) individuals [ADDRESS_1162911] 6 months after completion of primary vaccination with BNT162b2.

shown to be efficacious in the prevention of COVID-[ADDRESS_1162912] licenses or conditional

of BNT162 vaccines in pregnant women, preliminary data are available from the ongoingPhase 1/2/[ADDRESS_1162913] common solicited adverse reactions were injection site reactions (84.1%), fatigue (62.9%), headache (55.1%), muscle pain (38.3%), chills (31.9%), joint pain (23.6%), and fever (14.2%).
19Adverse reactions characterized as reactogenicity were generally mild 
to moderate.  The number of participants reporting hypersensitivity-related AEs was numerically higher in the vaccine group compared with the placebo group (137 [0.63%] vs 111 [0.51%]).  Severe adverse reactions occurred in 0.0% to 4.6% of participants, were more frequent after Dose 2 than after Dose 1, and were generally less frequent in older adults 
(>55 years of age) ( ≤2.8%) as compared to younger participants ( ≤4.6%).  Among reported 
unsolicited AEs, lymphadenopathy occurred much more frequently in the active vaccine group than the placebo group and is plausibly related to vaccination.  SAEs, while 
uncommon ( <1.0%), represented medical events that occur in the general population at 
similar frequency as observed in the study.
19
No specific safety concerns were identified in subgroup analyses by [CONTACT_654], race, ethnicity, medical comorbidities, or prior SARS-CoV-2 infection.  The risks are based on the observed safety profile to date, which shows mostly mild reactogenicity, low incidence of severe or serious events, and no clinically concerning safety observations.  The preponderance of severe cases of COVID-19 in the placebo group relative to the BNT162b2 group (9 of 10) suggests no evidence of VAED.

rats twice before the start of mating and twice during gestation at the human clinical dose was associated with nonadverse effects (body weight, food consumption, and effects localized to the injection site) after each dose administration. However, there were no effects of BNT162b2 administration on mating performance, fertility, or any ovarian or uterine parameters in the female rats or on embryo-fetal or postnatal survival, growth, or development in the offspring. An immune response was confirmed in female rats following administration of each vaccine candidate and these responses were also detectable in the offspring (fetuses and pups). Additional details are included in the IB.
More detailed information about the known and expected benefits and risks and reasonably 
expected AEs of BNT162b2 may be found in the IB, which is the SRSD for this study.

4.1. Overall DesignThis will be a global Phase 2/3, randomized, placebo-controlled, observer-blind study in 
approximately 350 healthy pregnant women 18 years of age or older vaccinated during their 24 to 34 weeks’ gestation. This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of 2 doses of BNT162b2 or placebo administered 21 days apart.  The Phase 2 portion of the study will include approximately 200 pregnant women randomized 1:1 to receive BNT162b2 or placebo (saline) during their 27 to 34 weeks’ gestation. Safety datathrough 7 days after the second dose (where Day 1 is the day of vaccination) for all Phase 2 participants will be reviewed by [CONTACT_837393]. The Phase 3 portion of this study will assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of BNT162b2 in approximately 150 pregnant women enrolled during their 24 to 34 weeks’ gestation who will be randomized in a 1:1 ratioto receive BNT162b2 or placebo (saline).

The study is observer-blinded, as the physical appearance of the investigational vaccine and 
the placebo may differ. The participant, investigator, study coordinator, and other site staff will be blinded through the 1-month postdelivery visit for each maternal participant.  At the study site, only the dispenser(s)/administrator(s) are unblinded.
Each maternal participant will participate in the study for approximately up to 10 months
depending on the vaccine group to which she was randomized. Her infant will participate in the study for approximately 6 months. The study duration will be approximately 14 months.
For each placebo recipi[INVESTIGATOR_837358]162b2 and follow a new visit 
schedule ( Section 1.3.2 ), she will participate in the study for up to [ADDRESS_1162927]. A [COMPANY_007] IRC will be used 
during the Phase 2 portion of the study to closely monitor safety.
The study will include stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004], which may result in a pause to study vaccination 
followed by a review and recommendation by [CONTACT_26732].
4.2. Scientific Rationale for Study Design
There are currently no licensed vaccines to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2 or 
COVID-19.  Pregnant women are at risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection, developi[INVESTIGATOR_35910]-19 and COVID-19–associated complications. Given the global crisis of COVID-[ADDRESS_1162928] maternal immunization safety and 
immunogenicity clinical trial; however, additional surveillance for COVID-19 has been included as part of the study to assess efficacy (based on a minimal number of cases) as well as to monitor the potential risk of disease enhancement and severe disease in pregnant women and their infants with COVID-19.  If a participant experiences symptoms, as detailed 
in Section 8.13 , a COVID-19 illness and subsequent convalescent visit will occur.  As part of 
these visits, samples (nasal swab and blood) will be taken for antigen and antibody assessment as well as recording of COVID-19–related clinical and laboratory information (including local diagnosis).
4.3. Justification for Dose
Based on data from the Phase 1 component of clinical trial C4591001, the BNT162b2 
vaccine candidate was selected at a dose of 30 μg for Phase 2/3 evaluation in C4591001.

1. The investigator or designee must confirm that appropriate temperature conditions have 
been maintained during transit for all study interventions received and any discrepancies are reported and resolved before use of the study intervention.
2. Only maternal participants enrolled in the study may receive study intervention and only 
authorized site staff may supply or administer study intervention.  All study interventionsmust be stored in a secure, environmentally controlled, and monitored (manual or automated recording) area in accordance with the labeled storage conditions with access limited to the investigator and authorized site staff.  At a minimum, daily minimum and maximum temperatures for all site storage locations must be documented and available upon request.  Data for nonworking days must indicate the minimum and maximum temperatures since previously documented for all site storage locations upon return to business.
3. Any excursions from the study intervention label storage conditions should be reported to 
[COMPANY_007] upon discovery along with any actions taken.  The site should actively pursue options for returning the study intervention to the storage conditions described in the labeling, as soon as possible.  Once an excursion is identified, the study intervention must be quarantined and not used until [COMPANY_007] provides permission to use the study intervention.  Specific details regarding the definition of an excursion and information the site should report for each excursion will be provided to the site in the IP manual.

Study intervention and placebo will be prepared by [CONTACT_78255].  The study intervention will be administered in such a way as to ensure that the maternal participants remain blinded.
6.3. Measures to Minimize Bias: Randomization and Blinding
6.3.1. Allocation to Study InterventionMaternal participants will be allocated (randomized) to a vaccine group as described below. 
The infants of the maternal participants will be assigned a participant number at birth.
Allocation of maternal participants to vaccine groups will proceed through the use of an IRT 
system (IWR).  The site personnel (study coordinator or specified designee) will be required to enter or select information including but not limited to the user’s ID and password, the protocol number, and the maternal participant number.  The site personnel will then be provided with a vaccine assignment, randomization number, and DU or container number when study intervention is being supplied via the IRT system. The IRT system will provide a confirmation report containing the maternal participant number, randomization number, and DU or container number assigned.  The confirmation report must be stored in the site’s files.
Study intervention will be dispensed at the study visits summarized in the SoA.
The study-specific IRT reference manual and IP manual will provide the contact [CONTACT_22810].
Maternal participants will be assigned to receive study intervention according to 
randomization scheme.  Investigators will remain blinded to each maternal participant’s assigned study intervention until 1 month after delivery.

In the event of a Quality Assurance audit, the auditor(s) will be allowed access to unblinded 
study intervention records at the site(s) to verify that randomization/dispensing has been done accurately.
To allow administration of BNT162b2 to maternal participants who originally received 
placebo, site staff will be unblinded to individual participants’ original study intervention allocation at the 1-month postdelivery visit.
6.3.3. Blinding of Site Personnel Prior to the 1-Month Postdelivery Visit
To allow administration of BNT162b2 to maternal participants who originally received 
placebo, site staff will be unblinded to individual participants’ original study intervention allocation at the 1-month postdelivery visit.  Prior to unblinding maternal participants at the 1-month postdelivery visit, this is an obse rver-blinded study. The study staff receiving, 
storing, dispensing, preparing, and administering the study interventions will be unblinded.  All other study and site personnel, including the investigator, investigator staff, and maternal participants, will be blinded to study intervention assignments until the 1-month postdeliveryvisit for each participant.  In particular, the individuals who evaluate maternal participant safety prior to unblinding maternal participants at the 1-month postdelivery visit will be blinded.
Because the BNT162 RNA-based COVID-19 vaccine candidate and placebo are different in 
physical appearance, the study intervention syringes will be administered in a manner that prevents the maternal study participants from identifying the study intervention type based on its appearance during the blinded portion of the study.

6.3.4. Blinding of the Sponsor
The study team will be unblinded to the participant’s study intervention allocation when 
maternal participants complete the 1-month postdelivery visit. Prior to unblinding the maternal participants at the 1-month postdelivery visit the majority of sponsor staff will be blinded to study intervention allocation.  All laboratory testing personnel performing serology assays will remain blinded to study intervention assigned/received.  The following sponsor staff, who will have no part in the blinded conduct of the study, will be unblinded (further details will be provided in a data blinding plan):
•Those study team members who are involved in ensuring that protocol requirements for 
study intervention preparation, handling, allocation, and administration are fulfilled at the site will be unblinded for the duration of the study (eg, unblinded study manager, unblinded clinical research associate).
•Unblinded clinician(s) who are not direct members of the study team and will not 
participate in any other study-related activities will review unblinded protocol deviations.
•An unblinded team supporting interactions with, and analyses for, the DMC 
(seeSection 9.6 ).  This will comprise a statistician, programmer(s), and a medical 
monitor and/or a clinical scientist who will review cases of severe COVID-[ADDRESS_1162940] weekly for additional potential cases of severe COVID-19 (see Section 8.2.4 ).
•An unblinded submissions team will be responsible for preparing unblinded analyses and 
documents to support regulatory activities that may be required while the study is ongoing.  This team will only be unblinded at the group level and not have access to individual participant assignments.  The programs that produce the summary tables will be developed and validated by [CONTACT_522122], and these programs will be run by [CONTACT_837397].

Page 576.3.5. Breaking the Blind
The IRT will be programmed with blind-breaking instructions.  In case of an emergency, the 
investigator has the sole responsibility for determining if unblinding of a maternalparticipant’s vaccine assignment is warranted. Participant safety must always be the first consideration in making such a determination. If the investigator decides that unblinding is warranted, the investigator should make every effort to contact [CONTACT_1152] a maternal participant’s vaccine assignment unless this could delay further management of the participant.
If a maternal participant’s vaccine assignment is unblinded, the sponsor must be notified 
within [ADDRESS_1162941] information 
and further details on the use of the IRT system.

6.4. Study Intervention Compliance
When maternal participants are dosed at the site, they will receive study intervention directly 
from the investigator or designee, under medical supervision.  The date and time of each dose administered in the clinic will be recorded in the source documents and recorded in the CRF.  The dose of study intervention and maternal study participant identification will be confirmed at the time of dosing by a member of the study site staff other than the person administering the study intervention.

7. DISCONTINUATION OF STUDY INTERVENTION AND PARTICIPANT 
DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL
7.1. Discontinuation of Study InterventionIn rare instances, it may be necessary for a participant to permanently discontinue study 
intervention (definitive discontinuation). Reasons for definitive discontinuation of study intervention include the following: AEs; participant request; investigator request; protocol deviation (including no longer meeting all the inclusion criteria, or meeting 1 or more exclusion criteria). In general, unless the investigator considers it unsafe to administer the second dose, or the maternal participant does not wish to receive it, it is preferred that the second dose be administered. Note: following Vaccination 1, a positive SARS-CoV-2 NAAT result without symptoms or a COVID-19 diagnosis (signs/symptoms only or signs/symptoms and a positive SARS-CoV-2 NAAT result) should not result in discontinuation from the study intervention.
Note that discontinuation of study intervention does not represent withdrawal from the study.  
Per the study estimands if study intervention is definitively discontinued, the participant will remain in the study to be evaluated for safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity. See the SoA
for data to be collected at the time of discontinuation of study intervention and follow-up for any further evaluations that need to be completed.
In the event of discontinuation of study intervention, it must be documented on the 
appropriate CRF/in the medical records whether the participant is discontinuing further receipt of study intervention or also from study procedures, postvaccination study follow-up, and/or future collection of additional information.

Page 607.2. Participant Discontinuation/Withdrawal From the Study
A maternal participant may withdraw from the st udy at any time at her own request or the 
infant participant may be withdrawn at any time at the request of his/her parent(s).  Reasons for discontinuation from the study include the following:
•Refused further follow-up;
•Lost to follow-up;
•Death;
•Study terminated by [CONTACT_3211];
•AEs;
•Maternal participant request; 
•Investigator request;
•Protocol deviation.
If a participant does not return for a scheduled visit, every effort should be made to contact 
[CONTACT_2299].  All attempts to contact [CONTACT_837398]’s source document.  In any circumstance, every effort should be made to document participant outcome, if possible.
The investigator or his or her designee should capture the reason for withdrawal in the CRF 
for all participants.
If a participant withdraws from the study, she may request destruction of any remaining 
samples taken and not tested, and the investigator must document any such requests in the site study records and notify the sponsor accordingly.
If the participant withdraws from the study and also withdraws consent (see Section 7.2.1 ) 
for disclosure of future information, no further evaluations should be performed and no additional data should be collected.  The sponsor may retain and continue to use any data collected before such withdrawal of consent.
Lack of completion of all or any of the withdrawal/early termination procedures will not be

Participants should notify the investigator in writing of the decision to withdraw consent from future follow-up, whenever possible.  The withdrawal of consent should be explained in detail in the medical records by [CONTACT_093], as to whether the withdrawal is only from further receipt of study intervention or also from study procedures and/or postvaccination study follow-up, and entered on the appropriate CRF page.  In the event that vital status (whether the participant is alive or dead) is being measured, publicly available information should be used to determine vital status only as appropriately directed in accordance with local law.
7.3. Lost to Follow-up
A maternal participant will be considered lost to follow-up if she repeatedly fails to return for 
scheduled visits and is unable to be contact[CONTACT_9298].
The following actions must be taken if a participant fails to return for scheduled visits and is 
unable to be contact[CONTACT_9298]:
•The site must attempt to contact [CONTACT_29526]/or should continue in the study.
•Before a participant is deemed lost to follow-up, the investigator or designee must make 
every effort to regain contact [CONTACT_6635] (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if necessary, a certified letter to the participant’s last known mailing address or local equivalent methods).  These contact [CONTACT_13140]’s medical record.
•Should the participant continue to be unreachable, she will be considered to have 
withdrawn from the study.
8. STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES
The investigator (or an appropriate delegate at the investigator site) must obtain a signed and 
dated ICD before performing any study-specific procedures.
Study procedures and their timing are summarized in the SoA. Protocol waivers or 
exemptions are not allowed.
The full date of birth will be collected to critically evaluate the immune response and safety 
profile by [CONTACT_654].

Procedures conducted as part of the maternal participant’s routine clinical management and 
obtained before signing of the ICD may be utilized for baseline and/or screening purposes provided the procedures met the protocol-specified criteria and were performed within the time frame defined in the SoA.
Every effort should be made to ensure that protocol-required tests and procedures are 
completed as described.  However, it is anticipated that from time to time there may be circumstances outside the control of the investigator that may make it unfeasible to perform the test.  In these cases, the investigator must take all steps necessary to ensure the safety and well-being of the participant.  When a protocol-required test cannot be performed, the investigator will document the reason for the missed test and any corrective and preventive actions that he or she has taken to ensure that required processes are adhered to as soon as possible.  The study team must be informed of these incidents in a timely manner.
For samples being collected and shipped, detailed collection, processing, storage, and 
shipment instructions and contact [CONTACT_22819].
The total blood sampling volume in this study is dependent on when a maternal participant is 
enrolled and which vaccine she is given while pregnant. It is expected that most maternal participants will have to give up to 6 blood samples (20 mL each).
Additionally, [ADDRESS_1162944] blood will be taken from each infant participant; if cord blood is unavailable, a blood sample of up to 5 mL (based on weight) will be collected. A 5-mL blood sample will be collected from each infant at the 6-month postdelivery visit; in addition, a blood sample of up to 5 mL will be collected at each convalescent illness visit.

In order to record information on fever, a thermometer will be given to maternal participants 
with instructions on how to measure oral temperature at home.  Temperature will be collected in the reactogenicity e-diary in the evening daily during the reactogenicity e-diary reporting period.  It will also be collected at any time during the reactogenicity e-diary data collection periods when fever is suspected.  Similarly, based on local practice in certain countries/locales, the study staff/field worker will call or visit maternal participants daily during the reactogenicity reporting period to collect the temperature.
Fever is defined as an oral temperature of ≥38.0°C (100.4°F).  The highest temperature for 
each day will be recorded in the reactogenicity e-diary.  Temperature will be measured and recorded to [ADDRESS_1162965].  Temperatures recorded in degrees Fahrenheit will be programmatically converted to degrees Celsius and then categorized during analysis according to the scale shown in Table 4.
If a fever of ≥39.0°C (102.1°F) is reported in the reactogenicity e-diary, a telephone contact 
[CONTACT_214345] a site visit is clinically indicated.  Only an investigator or medically qualified person is able to confirm a maternal participant’s fever as >40.0°C (>104.0°F).

Page 76The investigator and any qualified designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and 
recording events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible to pursue and obtain adequate information both to determine the outcome and to assess whether the event meets the criteria for classification as an SAE or caused the participant to discontinue the study intervention (see Section 7.1 ).
Each maternal participant and parent of the infant participant will be questioned about the 
occurrence of AEs in a nonleading manner.
In addition, the investigator may be requested by [CONTACT_22835]-up 
information in an expedited fashion.
The procedures described in this section pertain to both the infant participant and maternal 
participant, unless otherwise indicated.
8.3.1. Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE Information
The time period for actively eliciting and collecting AEs and SAEs (“active collection 
period”) for each maternal participant including her fetus begins from the time the maternal participant provides informed consent, which is obtained before participation in the study (ie, before undergoing any study-related procedure and/or receiving study intervention), through and including a minimum of [ADDRESS_1162967] be reported in the CRF.
Additionally, for those maternal participants who originally received placebo but go on to 
receive BNT162b2 at Visit 101 and Visit 102, AEs and SAEs will be collected through and 1 month after the second dose of BNT162b2 (Visit 103).
For the infant participant, the time period for actively eliciting and collecting nonserious AEs 
(“active collection period”) begins at birth and continues through and including 1 month after birth. SAEs and AESIs will be collected from birth through and including 6 months of age.
Follow-up by [CONTACT_340757] a level acceptable to the 
investigator and [COMPANY_007] concurs with that assessment.
For maternal participants who are screen failures, the active collection period ends when 
screen failure status is determined.

Protocol C4591015Final Protocol Amendment 5, [ADDRESS_1162968] be recorded on the CRF and the SAE reported using the Vaccine SAE Reporting Form.
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs after the participant has 
concluded study participation.  However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a participant has completed the study, and he/she considers the event to be reasonably related to the study intervention, the investigator must promptly report the SAE to [COMPANY_007] using the Vaccine SAE Reporting Form.
Note : Potential COVID-19/MIS-C illnesses and their sequelae that are consistent with the 
clinical endpoint definition ( Section 8.1 ) should not be recorded as AEs. These data will be 
captured to describe disease endpoints for lack-of-efficacy assessment data only on the relevant pages of the CRF, as these are expected endpoints.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Reporting SAEs to [COMPANY_007] Safety
All SAEs occurring in a participant during the active collection period as described in 
Section 8.3.1 are reported to [COMPANY_007] Safety on the Vaccine SAE Reporting Form, if 
applicable, immediately upon awareness and under no circumstance should this exceed 24 hours.
If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy, 
spontaneous abortion, including miscarriage and missed abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death defined as those that occur within 1 month of birth, or congenital anomaly [in a live-born baby, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise, or a neonatal death]), the investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs.  In addition, infant deaths after 1 month of age should be reported as SAEs.
Further follow-up may be requested by [CONTACT_837409] a case-by-case 
basis (eg, follow-up on preterm infants to identify developmental delays).
SAEs occurring in the mother after the active collection period has ended are reported to 
[COMPANY_007] Safety if the investigator becomes aware of them; at a minimum, all SAEs that the investigator believes have at least a reasonable possibility of being related to study intervention must be reported to [COMPANY_007] Safety.
For those SAEs or deaths that occur to the infant after the active collection period should be 
reported when the investigator believes the SAE or death has at least a reasonable possibility of being related to study intervention.

All nonserious AEs and SAEs occurring in a participant during the active collection period, 
which begins after obtaining informed consent as described in Section 8.3.[ADDRESS_1162969] on the CRF all directly observed and all spontaneously reported 
AEs and SAEs reported by [CONTACT_2299].
The investigator obtains general information on the pregnancy and its outcome for all study 
participants.  The investigator will follow the pregnancy until completion (or until pregnancy termination).  In the case of a live birth, the structural integrity of the neonate can be assessed at the time of birth.  In the event of a termination, the reason(s) for termination should be specified and, if clinically possible, the structural integrity of the terminated fetus should be assessed by [CONTACT_4692] (unless preprocedure test findings are conclusive for a congenital anomaly and the findings are reported).
If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy, 
spontaneous abortion, including miscarriage and missed abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death defined as those deaths that occur within 1 month of birth, or congenital anomaly (in a live-born baby, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise, or a neonatal death), the investigator should record this information in the CRF.  In addition, infant deaths after 1 month of age should be recorded in the CRF as SAEs.
8.3.2. Method of Detecting AEs and SAEs
The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of AEs and SAEs and the 
procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in Appendix 2 .
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs.  Open-ended and 
nonleading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about AE occurrences.
8.3.3. Follow-up of AEs and SAEs
After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each 
participant at subsequent visits/contacts.  For each event, the investigator must pursue and obtain adequate information until resolution, stabilization, the event is otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow-up (as defined in Section 7.3 ).
In general, follow-up information will include a description of the event in sufficient detail to 
allow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independent determination of possible causality.  Any information relevant to the event, such as concomitant medications 
and illnesses, must be provided.  In the case of a participant death, a summary of available autopsy findings must be submitted as soon as possible to [COMPANY_007] Safety.
Further information on follow-up procedures is given in Appendix 2 .

Prompt notification by [CONTACT_22836] a study intervention under clinical investigation are met.
The sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other 
regulatory agencies about the safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation.  The sponsor will comply with country-specific regulatory requirements relating to safety reporting to the regulatory authority, IRBs/ECs, and investigators.
Investigator safety reports must be prepared for S[LOCATION_003]Rs according to local regulatory 
requirements and sponsor policy and forwarded to investigators as necessary.
An investigator who receives S[LOCATION_003]Rs or other specific safety information (eg, summary or 
listing of SAEs) from the sponsor will review and then file it along with the SRSD(s) for the study and will notify the IRB/EC, if appropriate according to local requirements.
8.3.5. Additional Exposure Scenarios That May Result From the Exposure to the Study 
Intervention
[IP_ADDRESS]. Environmental Exposure During PregnancyEnvironmental exposure occurs when, during the performance of job duties, a person 
(whether a healthcare professional or otherwise) gets in unplanned direct contact [CONTACT_837410], which may or may not lead to the occurrence of an AE.  Such persons 
may include HCPs, family members, and other roles that are involved in the trial participant’s care.
Note: This does NOT apply to maternal participants enrolled in this trial.
•The scenarios below describe environmental exposures that could lead to an EDP:
•A female is found to be pregnant while being exposed or having been exposed to 
study intervention by [CONTACT_837411]. Below are some examples:
•A female family member or healthcare provider reports that she is pregnant after 
having been exposed to the study intervention by [CONTACT_837412].
•A male family member or healthcare provider who has been exposed to the study 
intervention then exposes his female partner prior to or around the time of conception.

Protocol C4591015Final Protocol Amendment 5, [ADDRESS_1162970] report EDP to [COMPANY_007] Safety within 24 hours of the investigator’s 
awareness, irrespective of whether an SAE has occurred. The investigator must report information to [COMPANY_007] Safety using the Vaccine SAE Reporting Form and EDP Supplemental Form.  The initial information submitted should include the anticipated date of delivery (see below for information related to termination of pregnancy). Since the exposure information does not pertain to the participant enrolled in the study, the information is not recorded on a CRF; however, a copy of the completed Vaccine SAE Reporting Form is maintained in the investigator site file.
Follow-up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy and its outcome for 
all EDP reports with an unknown outcome. The investigator will follow the pregnancy until completion (or until pregnancy termination) and notify [COMPANY_007] Safety of the outcome as a follow-up to the initial EDP Supplemental Form.
In the case of a live birth, the structural integrity of the neonate can be assessed at the time of 
birth. In the event of a termination, the reason(s) for termination should be specified and, if clinically possible, the structural integrity of the terminated fetus should be assessed by [CONTACT_4692] (unless preprocedure test findings are conclusive for a congenital anomaly and the findings are reported).
Abnormal pregnancy outcomes are considered SAEs. If the outcome of the pregnancy meets 
the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy, spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly [in a live-born baby, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise, or a neonatal death]), the investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs.
Additional information about pregnancy outcomes that are reported to [COMPANY_007] Safety as SAEs 
follows: 
•Spontaneous abortion including miscarriage and missed abortion;
•Neonatal deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_1162971] to 
causality, as SAEs. In addition, infant deaths after 1 month should be reported as SAEs when the investigator assesses the infant death as related or possibly related to exposure to the study intervention.
Additional information regarding the EDP may be requested by [CONTACT_456]. Further 
follow-up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case-by-case basis (eg, follow-up on preterm infants to identify developmental delays).

Page [IP_ADDRESS]. Exposure During Breastfeeding
Exposure-during-breastfeeding reports are not expected for maternal participants who 
breastfeed a child delivered during the study.
Environmental exposure during breastfeeding occurs when a female family member or 
healthcare provider who reports that she is breastfeeding after having been exposed to the study intervention (eg, by [CONTACT_19991]).  The investigator must report exposure during breastfeeding to [COMPANY_007] Safety within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness, irrespective of whether an SAE has occurred. The information must be reported using the Vaccine SAE Reporting Form. When exposure during breastfeeding occurs in the setting of environmental exposure, the exposure information does not pertain to the participant enrolled in the study , so the information is not recorded on a CRF. However, a copy of the completed 
Vaccine SAE Reporting Form is maintained in the investigator site file.
An exposure-during-breastfeeding report is not created when a [COMPANY_007] drug specifically 
approved for use in breastfeeding women (eg, vitamins) is administered in accord with authorized use. However, if the infant experiences an SAE associated with such a drug, the SAE is reported together with the exposure during breastfeeding.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Occupational Exposure
An occupational exposure occurs when a person receives unplanned direct contact [CONTACT_22839], which may or may not lead to the occurrence of an AE.  Such persons may include healthcare providers, family members, and other roles that are involved in the trial participant’s care.
The investigator must report occupational exposure to [COMPANY_007] Safety within 24 hours of the 
investigator’s awareness, regardless of whether there is an associated SAE.  The information must be reported using the Vaccine SAE Reporting Form.  Since the information does not pertain to a participant enrolled in the study, the information is not recorded on a CRF; however, a copy of the completed Vaccine SAE Reporting Form is maintained in the investigator site file.

to study intervention.
Potential COVID-19/MIS-C illness events and their sequelae will be reviewed by a group of 
internal blinded case reviewers.  Any SAE that is determined by [CONTACT_837413].  The investigator must report the SAE to [COMPANY_007] Safety within 24 hours of being made aware that the SAE did not meet endpoint criteria.  The investigator’s SAE awareness date is the date on which the investigator site of incidence receives the SAE back from the internal case reviewers.
8.3.8. Adverse Events of Special Interest
This section provides information on AESIs that may be detected during the study. The 
following events are considered AESIs:
•A confirmed diagnosis of myocarditis or pericarditis. See Section 8.14 for additional 
procedures for monitoring of potential myocarditis or pericarditis.

8.13. COVID-19 Surveillance (All Maternal Participants)
If a participant experiences any of the following from the time of vaccination (irrespective of 
perceived etiology or clinical significance), she is instructed to contact [CONTACT_837419], if confirmed, participate in an in-person or telehealth visit as soon as possible, optimally within 3 days after symptom onset (and at the latest 4 days after symptom resolution).Note that:
•If new symptoms are reported within 4 days after resolution of all previous symptoms, 
they will be considered as part of a single illness and a second illness visit is not required;
•Surveillance of potential COVID-[ADDRESS_1162977] earlier in the study.
During the 7 days following each vaccination, potential COVID-19 symptoms that overlap 
with specific systemic events (ie, fever, chills, new or increased muscle pain, diarrhea, vomiting) should not trigger a potential COVID-19 illness visit unless, in the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], the clinical pi[INVESTIGATOR_837376] a possible COVID-19 illness than vaccine reactogenicity.
If, in the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], the symptoms are considered more likely to be vaccine 
reactogenicity, but a participant is required to demonstrate that they are SARS-CoV-2–negative, a local SARS-CoV-[ADDRESS_1162978] may be performed: if positive, the 
symptoms should be recorded as a potential COVID-19 illness; if not, the symptoms should be recorded as AEs (unless already captured in the reactogenicity e-diary).

Page 1058.19. COVID-19 Surveillance (All Infant Participants)
If an infant participant experiences any of the following (irrespective of perceived etiology or 
clinical significance), the maternal participant is instructed to contact [CONTACT_837426], if confirmed, participate in an in-person or telehealth visit as soon as possible, optimally within 3 days after symptom onset (and at the latest 4 days after symptom resolution). Note that this does not substitute for an infant participant’s routine medical care.  Therefore, maternal participants should be encouraged to seek care, if appropriate, from their infant’s usual provider.
Additionally:
•If new symptoms are reported within 4 days after resolution of all previous symptoms, 
they will be considered as part of a single illness and a second illness visit is not required;
•Surveillance of potential COVID-[ADDRESS_1162991] earlier in the study.

•A diagnosis of COVID-19;
•Fever; 
•New or increased cough; 
•New or increased shortness of breath;
•Diarrhea;
•Vomiting.
8.19.1. Potential Infant COVID-19/MIS-C Illness Visit (Optimally Within 3 Days After 
Potential COVID-19 Illness Onset)
This visit may be conducted as an in-person or telehealth visit; a telehealth visit involves the 
sharing of healthcare information and services via telecommunication technologies (eg, audio, video, videoconferencing software) remotely, thus allowing the parent and investigator to communicate on aspects of the infant’s clinical care.

Page 1089. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
Methodology for summary and statistical analyses of the data collected in this study is 
described here and further detailed in a SAP, which will be maintained by [CONTACT_456].  The SAP may modify what is outlined in the protocol where appropriate; however, any major modifications of the primary endpoint definitions or their analyses will also be reflected in a protocol amendment.
9.1. Estimands and Statistical Hypotheses
9.1.1. EstimandsThe estimands corresponding to each primary, secondary, and exploratory objective are 
described in the table in Section 3 .
In the primary safety objective evaluations, missing reactogenicity e-diary data will not be 
imputed. Missing AE start dates will be imputed according to [COMPANY_007] safety rules. No other missing information will be imputed in the safety analysis.
The estimands to evaluate the immunogenicity objectives are based on the evaluable 
immunogenicity populations ( Section 9.3 ). These estimands estimate the vaccine effect in 
the hypothetical settings where participants follow the study schedules and protocol requirements as directed. Missing antibody results will not be imputed. Immunogenicity results that are below the LLOQ will be set to 0.5 × LLOQ in the analysis; this may be adjusted once additional data on the assay characteristics become available.
The estimands to evaluate the efficacy objectives are based on the evaluable efficacy 
populations ( Section 9.3 ).  These estimands estimate the vaccine effect in the hypothetical 
setting where participants follow the study schedules and protocol requirements as directed.  In addition, VE will also be analyzed by [CONTACT_837428]-available efficacy (mITT) populations. Missing laboratory results will not be imputed.
9.1.2. Statistical Hypotheses
Due to early enrollment termination and reduced sample size, all endpoints will be analyzed
descriptively without formal hypothesis tests.
9.2. Sample Size Determination
The sample size for the Phase [ADDRESS_1162996] 1 AE for a given 
true event rate of a particular AE, for various sample sizes. For example, if the true AE rate is 2%, with 100 participants in a vaccine group, there is 95% probability of observing at least 1 AE in Phase 2. If the true AE rate is 1%, with 175 participants in a vaccine group, there is 83% probability of observing at least 1 AE in Phase 3.

9.4. Statistical Analyses
The SAP will be developed and finalized before any analyses are performed and will 
describe the analyses and procedures for accounting for missing, unused, and spurious data. This section is a summary of the planned statistical analyses of the primary and secondary endpoints.
9.4.1. General Considerations
CIs for all endpoints in the statistical analysis will be presented as 2-sided at the 95% level 
unless specified otherwise.
The safety analyses are based on the safety populations.  Participants will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_837430] (or their mothers) actually received.  Missing reactogenicity e-diary data will not be imputed; missing AE dates will be handled according to the [COMPANY_007] safety rules.
For all the immunogenicity endpoints, the analysis will be based on the evaluable 
immunogenicity populations. An additional analysis may be performed based on the all-available immunogenicity populations if there is a large enough difference in sample size between the all-available immunogenicity populations and the evaluable immunogenicity populations.  Participants will be summarized according to the vaccine group to which they (or their mothers) were randomized.  Missing serology data will not be imputed.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Analyses for Binary Data
Descriptive statistics for categorical variables (eg, proportions) are the percentage (%), the 
numerator (n) and the denominator (N) used in the percentage calculation, and the 95% CIs where applicable.
The exact 95% CI for binary endpoints for each group will be computed using the 
F distribution (Clopper-Pearson). The 95% CI for the between-group difference for binary endpoints will be calculated using the Miettinen and Nurminen method.
The 3-tier approach will be used to summarize AEs.  For both Tier 1 (if any are identified 
during the study) and Tier 2 events, a 95% CI for the between-group difference in proportions will be calculated based on the Miettinen and Nurminen method.  In addition, for Tier 1 events (if any), the asymptotic p-values will also be presented for the difference in proportions, based on the same test statistic and under the assumption that the test statistic is asymptotically normally distributed.  For Tier 3 events, counts and percentages for each vaccine group will be provided.

[IP_ADDRESS].1. Geometric Means
The geometric means will be calculated as the mean of the assay results after making the 
logarithm transformation and then exponentiating the mean to express results on the original scale.  Two-sided 95% CIs will be obtained by [CONTACT_215880], calculating the 95% CI with reference to Student’s t-distribution, and then exponentiating the confidence limits.
[IP_ADDRESS].2. Geometric Mean Fold Rises
GMFRs are defined as ratios of the results after vaccination to the results before vaccination.  
GMFRs are limited to participants with nonmissing values at both time points.
GMFRs will be calculated as the mean of the difference of logarithmically transformed 
neutralization titers or antibody levels (later time point minus earlier time point) and exponentiating the mean.  The associated 2-sided 95% CIs are obtained by [CONTACT_837431]’s t-distribution for the mean difference on the logarithm scale and exponentiating the confidence limits.
[IP_ADDRESS].3. Geometric Mean Ratios
The GMR will be calculated as the mean of the difference of logarithmically transformed 
assay results (eg, SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing titers in pregnant women minus that in nonpregnant women) and exponentiating the mean.  Two-sided CIs will be obtained by [CONTACT_837432]’s t-distribution for the mean difference of the logarithmically transformed assay results and exponentiating the confidence limits.

Page [ZIP_CODE].2. Appendix 2: Adverse Events: Definitions and Procedures for Recording, 
Evaluating, Follow-up, and Reporting
For maternal immunization clinical studies conducted in pregnant women, data on the EDP 
as well as pregnancy outcome are collected and analyzed in the clinical database.  For these studies, in general, EDP cases are not reportable unless associated with SAEs/nonseriousAEs.
The term “participant” in this section refers to (1) the maternal participant and her fetus; and 
after delivery (2) the maternal participant and (3) the infant participant.
10.2.1. Definition of AE
AE Definition
•An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical study participant, 
temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention.
•NOTE: An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of study intervention.
Events Meeting the AE Definition
•Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) 
or other safety assessments (eg, ECG, radiological scans, vital sign measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinically significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the investigator. Any abnormal laboratory test results that meet any of the conditions below must be recorded as an AE:
•Is associated with accompanying symptoms;
•Requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention;
•Leads to a change in study dosing (outside of any protocol-specified dose 
adjustments) or discontinuation from the study, significant additional concomitant drug treatment, or other therapy.
•Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent preexisting condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.
•New conditions detected or diagnosed after study intervention administration even 
though it may have been present before the start of the study.
•Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug-drug interaction.

Page 125•Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study 
intervention or a concomitant medication.  Overdose per se will not be reported as an AE/SAE unless it is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self-harming intent.  Such overdoses should be reported regardless of sequelae.
Events NOT Meeting the AE Definition
•Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safety 
assessments which are associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by [CONTACT_11009]’s condition.
•The disease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of 
the disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the participant’s condition.
•Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that 
leads to the procedure is the AE.
•Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]).
•Anticipated day-to-day fluctuations of preexisting disease(s) or condition(s) present 
or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen.
10.2.2. Definition of SAE
If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious 
conditions are met (eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1080]/symptoms of the disease under study, death due to progression of disease).
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose:
a.Results in death
b.Is life-threatening
The term “life-threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the 
participant was at risk of death at the time of the event.  It does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.

When in doubt as to whether “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a preexisting condition that did not worsen from 
baseline is not considered an AE.
d.Results in persistent disability/incapacity
•The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct 
normal life functions.
•This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical 
significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle) which may interfere with or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.
e.Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect
f.Other situations:
•Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE 
reporting is appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_22772].  These events should usually be considered serious.
•Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment 
in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.
•Suspected transmission via a [COMPANY_007] product of an infectious agent, pathogenic or 
non-pathogenic, is considered serious.  The event may be suspected from clinical symptoms or laboratory findings indicating an infection in a patient exposed to a [COMPANY_007] product.  The terms “suspected transmission” and “transmission” are considered synonymous .  These cases are considered unexpected and handled as 
serious expedited cases by [CONTACT_20020].  Such cases are also considered for reporting as product defects, if appropriate.

AE and SAE Recording/Reporting
The table below summarizes the requirements for recording safety events on the CRF and 
for reporting safety events on the Vaccine SAE Reporting Form to [COMPANY_007] Safety.  These requirements are delineated for 3 types of events: (1) SAEs; (2) nonserious AEs; and (3) occupational exposure.
It should be noted that the Vaccine SAE Reporting Form for reporting of SAE information 
is not the same as the AE page of the CRF.  When the same data are collected, the forms must be completed in a consistent manner.  AEs should be recorded using concise medical terminology and the same AE term should be used on both the CRF and the Vaccine SAE Reporting Form for reporting of SAE information.
Safety Event Recorded on the CRF Reported on the Vaccine SAE 
Reporting Form to [COMPANY_007] Safety

SAE All All
Nonserious AE All None
Exposure to the study intervention under study via occupational exposureOccupational exposure is not 
recorded.Occupational exposure (regardless 
of whether associated with an AE)Note: Include all AEs/SAEs associated with occupational 
exposure.
•When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all 
documentation (eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1088], laboratory reports, and diagnostic 
reports) related to the event.
•The investigator will then record all relevant AE/SAE information in the CRF.
•It is notacceptable for the investigator to send photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_10914]’s 
medical records to [COMPANY_007] Safety in lieu of completion of the Vaccine SAE ReportingForm/AE/SAE CRF page.
•There may be instances when copi[INVESTIGATOR_240802].  In this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of the participant number, will be redacted on the copi[INVESTIGATOR_346246].
•The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, 
symptoms, and/or other clinical information.  Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not the individual signs/symptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE.

Page 128Assessment of Intensity
The investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported during 
the study and assign it to 1 of the following categories: 
GRADE If required on the AE page of the CRF, the investigator will use the adjectives MILD, 
MODERATE, SEVERE, or LIFE-THREATENING to describe the maximum intensity of the AE. For purposes of consistency, these intensity grades are defined as follows:
1 MILD Does not interfere with participant's usual function.
2 MODERATE Interferes to some extent with participant's usual function.
3 SEVERE Interferes significantly with participant's usual function.
4 LIFE-THREATENING Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.
An event is defined as “serious” when it meets at least 1 of the predefined outcomes as 
described in the definition of an SAE, NOT when it is rated as severe.
Assessment of Causality
•The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between study intervention 
and each occurrence of each AE/SAE.
•A “reasonable possibility” of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, 
and/or arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot be ruled out.
•The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship.
•Alternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other 
risk factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study intervention administration, will be considered and investigated.
•The investigator will also consult the IB and/or product information, for marketed 
products, in his/her assessment.
•For each AE/SAE, the investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she 
has reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality.
•There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investigator has 
minimal information to include in the initial report to the sponsor.  However, it is 
very important that the investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event before the initial transmission of the SAE data to the sponsor.

Page 129•The investigator may change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_9242]-up 
information and send an SAE follow-up report with the updated causality assessment.
•The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory 
reporting requirements.
•If the investigator does not know whether or not the study intervention caused the 
event, then the event will be handled as “related to study intervention” for reporting purposes, as defined by [CONTACT_456].  In addition, if the investigator determines that an SAE is associated with study procedures, the investigator must record this causal relationship in the source documents and CRF, and report such an assessment in the dedicated section of the Vaccine SAE Reporting Form and in accordance with the SAE reporting requirements.
Follow-up of AEs and SAEs
•The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by [CONTACT_22854]/or causality of the AE or SAE as fully as possible.  This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other healthcare providers.
•If a participant dies during participation in the study or during a recognized 
follow-up period, the investigator will provide  [COMPANY_007] Safety with a copy of any 
postmortem findings including histopathology.
•New or updated information will be recorded in the originally completed CRF.
•The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the sponsor within 24 hours of 
receipt of the information.
10.2.4. Reporting of SAEs
SAE Reporting to [COMPANY_007] Safety via an Electronic Data Collection Tool
•The primary mechanism for reporting an SAE to [COMPANY_007] Safety will be the electronic 
data collection tool.
•If the electronic system is unavailable, then the site will use the paper SAE data 
collection tool (see next section) in order to report the event within 24 hours.

•If a site receives a report of a new SAE from a study participant or receives updated 
data on a previously reported SAE after the electronic data collection tool has been taken off-line, then the site can report this information on a paper SAE form (see next section) or to [COMPANY_007] Safety by [CONTACT_756].
SAE Reporting to [COMPANY_007] Safety via Vaccine SAE Reporting Form
•Facsimile transmission of the Vaccine SAE Reporting Form is the preferred method 
to transmit this information to [COMPANY_007] Safety.
•In circumstances when the facsimile is not working, notification by [CONTACT_20021] a copy of the Vaccine SAE Reporting Form sent by [CONTACT_22855].
•Initial notification via telephone does not replace the need for the investigator to 
complete and sign the Vaccine SAE Reporting Form pages within the designated reporting time frames.

Page [ZIP_CODE].3. Appendix 3: Liver Safety: Suggested Actions and Follow-up Assessments
Potential Cases of Drug Induced Liver Injury
Humans exposed to a drug who show no sign of liver injury (as determined by [CONTACT_20023]) are termed “tolerators,” while those who show transient liver injury, but adapt are termed “adaptors.”  In some participants, transaminase elevations are a harbinger of a more serious potential outcome.  These participants fail to adapt and therefore are "susceptible" to progressive and serious liver injury, commonly referred to as DILI.  Participants who experience a transaminase elevation above 3 × ULN should be monitored more frequently to determine if they are an “adaptor” or are “susceptible.”
LFTs are not required as a routine safety monitoring procedure in this study.  However, 
should an investigator deem it necessary to assess LFTs because a participant presents with clinical signs/symptoms, such LFT results should be managed and followed as described below.
Studies that include more detailed hepatic safety assessments (eg, an external hepatic expert 
panel or DMC that has separate definitions and charter) will still need to follow the reporting guidelines described below for applicable cases.
In the majority of DILI cases, elevations in AST and/or ALT precede TBili elevations 
(>2 × ULN) by [CONTACT_22857].  The increase in TBili typi[INVESTIGATOR_161651]/ALT is/are still elevated above 3 × ULN (ie, AST/ALT and TBili values will be elevated within the same laboratory sample).  In rare instances, by [CONTACT_22858], AST/ALT values might have decreased.  This occurrence is still regarded as a potential DILI.  Therefore, abnormal elevations in either AST OR ALT in addition to TBili that meet the criteria outlined below are considered potential DILI (assessed per Hy’s law criteria) cases and should always be considered important medical events, even before all other possible causes of liver injury have been excluded.
The threshold of laboratory abnormalities for a potential DILI case depends on the 
participant’s individual baseline values and underlying conditions.  Participants who present with the following laboratory abnormalities should be evaluated further as potential DILI (Hy’s law) cases to definitively determine the etiology of the abnormal laboratory values:
Participants with AST/ALT and TBili baseline values within the normal range who 
subsequently present with AST OR ALT values >3 × ULN AND a TBili value >2 × ULN 
with no evidence of hemolysis and an alkaline phosphatase value <2 × ULN or not available.
For participants with baseline AST OR ALT OR TBili values above the ULN, the following 
threshold values are used in the definition mentioned above, as needed, depending on which values are above the ULN at baseline:
Preexisting AST or ALT baseline values above the normal range: AST or ALT 
values >2 times the baseline values AND >3 × ULN; or >8 × ULN (whichever is smaller).

Page 132Preexisting values of TBili above the normal range: TBili level increased from baseline value 
by [CONTACT_8895] 1 × ULN or if the value reaches >3 × ULN (whichever is smaller).
Rises in AST/ALT and TBili separated by [CONTACT_726] a few weeks should be assessed 
individually based on clinical judgment; any case where uncertainty remains as to whether it represents a potential Hy’s law case should be reviewed with the sponsor.  The Hepatic Injury Council (HIC) should be informed if such a situation occurs during the study; the HIC will provide the necessary support to the study team.
The participant should return to the investigator site and be evaluated as soon as possible, 
preferably within 48 hours from awareness of the abnormal results.  This evaluation should include laboratory tests, detailed history, and physical assessment.  For oncology studies, the possibility of hepatic neoplasia (primary or secondary) should be considered.
In addition to repeating measurements of AST and ALT and TBili for suspected cases of 
Hy’s law, additional laboratory tests should include albumin, CK, direct and indirect bilirubin, GGT, PT/INR, total bile acids, and alkaline phosphatase.  Consideration should also be given to drawing a separate tube of clotted blood and an anticoagulated tube of blood for further testing, as needed, for further contemporaneous analyses at the time of the recognized initial abnormalities to determine etiology.  A detailed history, including relevant information, such as review of ethanol, acetaminophen/paracetamol (either by [CONTACT_20025] a coformulated product in prescription or over the counter medications), recreational drug, supplement (herbal) use and consumption, family history, sexual history, travel history, history of contact [CONTACT_4490] a jaundiced person, surgery, blood transfusion, history of liver or allergic disease, and potential occupational exposure to chemicals, should be collected.  Further testing for acute hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E infection and liver imaging (eg, biliary tract) and collection of serum samples for acetaminophen/paracetamol drug and/or protein adduct levels may be warranted.
All cases demonstrated on repeat testing as meeting the laboratory criteria of AST/ALT and 
TBili elevation defined above should be considered potential DILI (Hy’s law) cases if no other reason for the LFT abnormalities has yet been found.  Such potential DILI (Hy’s law) cases are to be reported as SAEs, irrespective of availability of all the results of the investigations performed to determine etiology of the LFT abnormalities.
A potential DILI (Hy’s law) case becomes a confirmed case only after all results of 
reasonable investigations have been received and have excluded an alternative etiology.

          IRB #: 2018H0208  
          Approved: 5/31/[ADDRESS_246622] anorectal surgery is between 16- 20%. The 
incidence of urinary retention following high- risk ambulatory surgery is stated to be 5%. The 
objective of this study is to assess if not requiring patients to spontaneous void prior to 
discharge from the post -anesthesia care unit (PACU) will result in shorter lengths of stay in the 
post-anesthesia care unit without increasing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_206755].  
 Background & Research Significance  
 
Spontaneous void is a discharge criteria from post anesthesia care units given the potential need for bladder catheterization and prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_206756]. Research 
evaluating required spontaneous void following ambulatory anorectal surgery is lacking. 
Research has been conducted on patients requiring spi[INVESTIGATOR_206757] -operation is unnecessary and delays 
discharge times 
4. Previous research regarding post -operative urinary management of anorectal 
procedures classified them as ‘high- risk’ with other procedures5. Researchers have sought to 
address potential risk factors for urinary retention and discuss restriction of pre -operative, 
perioperative fluid, and adequate pain control to decrease the incidence1,2,6,7. Determining 
factors that specifically guide discharge for patients undergoing anorectal surgery and the 
necessity of post -operative void, however, has not been previously evaluated.  
 
Currently the protocol at The Ohio State University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_206758], but operations performed at The Ohio State University 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_206759] a spontaneous void prior to discharge. A recent IRB approved 
study conducted by [CONTACT_206765] a spontaneous void prior to discharge 
affects emergency room visits and readmission rates. We conducted a retrospective review of 
ambulatory anorectal surgeries performed at the two locations. One of these locations required 
the ability to void spontaneously as a prerequisite for discharge after ambulatory anorectal surgeries (spontaneous void group) whereas the other location did not maintain this requirement

3 and patients were discharged once they were deemed ready (no void group). Our research 
concluded that patients can be safely discharged without voiding after anorectal procedures without increasing the risk of ED visits or readmissions. Furthermore, a requirement to 
spontaneously void before discharge significantly prolongs PACU stays. Thus, we propose to 
compare PACU discharge times between patients requiring a spontaneous void to those patients not requiring a spontaneous void.  
 
Hypothesis:  
Ability to void spontaneously after anorectal procedures does not result in reduced 
readmissions, emergency room visits and post op complications.  
 Primary Objectives : 
1. To compare readmission and complications rates between patients who are required to void post anorectal surgeries to those who are sent home without voiding 
spontaneously.  
2. To compare the rates of emergency room visit between patients who are required to void 
post anorectal surgeries to those who are sent home without voiding spontaneously.  
 Secondary Objectives:  
1. To compare PACU times for patients  who are required to void post anorectal surgeries 
to those who are sent home without voiding spontaneously.  
2. To compare total hospi[INVESTIGATOR_206760].  
 
Study Plan and Procedures This study will be a prospective clinical trial, in which 100 anorectal  surgery patients will be 
randomly assigned to a control (spontaneous void) or experimental (no void) group. 
Randomization will be done using the free software provided by [CONTACT_129790].randomizer.org. “Spontaneous void” group will include 50 patients who will required to void spontaneously after 
anorectal surgeries. On the other hand “no void” group will be [ADDRESS_246623] -op day 30  using a study questionnaire to 
assess re -admission and emergency room visits .  
 Inclusion Criteria:  
1. Age 18- 80 years old  
2. Patients undergoing hemorrhoidectomy, fistulotomy or anal condyloma excision.  
 Exclusion Criteria:  
1. Age <18 yo or >80 yo  
2. Prisoners  
3. Pregnant Women

 Statistical Analysis  
 Data will be expressed using means +/ - standard deviations in addition to sample size (n) and 
percentages. Further statistical analysis will include Students t test for quantitative variables and 
chi squared test for comparisons of qualitative variables. A p value <0.05 will be used for 
statistical significance.

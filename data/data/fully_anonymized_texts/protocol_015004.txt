1.  Background and Significance  
 
 In August 2018, the ARRIVE trial was published in the New England Journ al of Medicine. This 
large, multicenter, randomized, controlled trial showed that elective induction of labor (IOL) at 39 
weeks’ gestation reduced the c -section rate, when compared to expectant management (awaiting labor 
until 41 weeks or other medical ind ication for induction arose) with a decrease in hypertensive disorders 
of pregnancy and no increase in neonatal or maternal morbidity or mortality1. Since then, demand for 
elective IOL has been increasing nationwide2; however, while IOL was shown to have m any positive 
benefits, it does lead to longer admission on labor and delivery when compared to spontaneous labor, 
and many labor and delivery units do not have the physical resources (rooms, nurses) to accommodate 
this surge in induction2-3.  
 Given this s train on resources, research has turned to identifying safe, effective outpatient 
methods for the initial steps of IOL, termed “cervical ripening”3-5. Cervical ripening prepares the cervix 
for induction of labor with Pi[INVESTIGATOR_31933], a synthetic oxytocin. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_395050], or efface, as Pi[INVESTIGATOR_395051] 
“ripening” phase.  
Both the Cook Balloon (Figure 1), a dual balloon mechanical cervical dilator, and Dilapan -S (Figure  2), a 
synthetic osmotic cervical dilator, are FDA approved for cervical ripening. Both have been shown to be 
effective inpatient agents of cervical ripening6. Most outpatient cervical ripening to date has been 
studied in mechanical balloon devices, either Foley catheter or Cook balloon 4-5. Dilapan -S has been 
more commonly used for outpatient cervical dilation prior to dilation and evacuation or other 
gynecolo gic procedures7 and patients and providers are less familiar with it for pre -induction of labor 
cervical ripening. Both the Cook catheter and Dilapan -S are already approved agents of outpatient 
cervical ripening at Brigham and Women’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. This study will be the first to compare Dilapan -S and 
the Cook catheter directly in the outpatient setting. Currently, the choice of outpatient ripening agent 
(mechanical ripening with a Cook balloon or Dilapan -S or pharmacologic ripening with misoprostol) is at 
the provider’s discretion at Brigham and Women’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Our study will help providers and patients 
make informed choice about the optimal mechanical ripening agent in the outpatient setting.

2. Specific Aims and Objectives  
 
Specific Aim 1: To determine if Dilapan -S is not inferior to Cook balloon for outpatient cervical ripening. 
We hypothesize that Dilapan -S is non -inferior to Cook balloon for cervical ripening, as measured by 
[CONTACT_395059].  
 
Specific Aim 2: To dete rmine with which method of outpatient cervical ripening patients are more 
satisfied.  We hypothesize that patients will be more satisfied with their experience with Dilapan -S 
when compared to the Cook Catheter.

Version 2021.[ADDRESS_496345] Selection  
 
Our study population will include women 18 -50 years of age at term (37 -41 6/7 weeks gestational 
age) who are low risk (i.e. without any maternal or fetal co -morbidity) and with a singleton gestation in 
cephalic presentation who are candidates for outpatient cervical ripening per th e Brigham and Women’s 
outpatient cervical ripening protocol (Appendix A). Both nulliparous and multiparous women will be 
included.  Women will need to have a bishop score <6 or cervical dilation <2cm with intact membranes 
to be included, as these are the w omen currently being offered outpatient cervical ripening prior to 
labor induction. Women will be excluded if there is a contraindication to outpatient cervical ripening per 
Brigham and Women’s outpatient cervical ripening protocol (Appendix A) or contrain dication to vaginal 
delivery. Women with history of a prior cesarean section will be excluded given their management may 
differ after cervical ripening. Non -English -speaking women will also be excluded given lack of study staff 
ability to communicate in la nguages other than English and lack of guaranteed 24/7 interpreters.  
Women who are patients of study investigators will be eligible for enrollment. This vulnerable 
population will be protected from coercion by [CONTACT_319704] a consent form to review at ho me prior to 
actual study enrollment and by [CONTACT_395066].  
 Women will be recruited from all practices that delivery at the Brigham, including Maternal 
Fetal Medicine, general Obstetrics clinics, private practice groups, and midwifery groups at Brigham and 
Women’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  By [CONTACT_395067], we should be enrolling a 
diverse patient population.  
 
5. Subject Enrollment  
 
Women will be booked for ou tpatient cervical ripening per their primary obstetrics provider.  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], 
cervical ripening  is scheduled by [CONTACT_395068]. Outpatient ripening is 
currently performed by a variety of methods (Cook balloon, Dilapan -S and misop rostol) at the primary 
provider’s discretion. The eligibility for each of these methods is the same, thus all patients scheduled 
for outpatient ripening in current clinical practice are potentially eligible for this study. At the time 
patient s are schedule d, the scheduling provider (nurse or MD) may inform the patient about the study. 
The scheduling provider will then let the study staff know if patients are interested and if they would like 
to be contact[CONTACT_395069]. Study staff will attempt  to contact [CONTACT_395070]. This will not be a pre -screening call as anyone who is scheduled for 
outpatient cer vical ripening is eligible for the study. Study staff will also monitor the outpatient ripening 
appointments booked through the EPIC schedule. Study staff will contact [CONTACT_395071] [ADDRESS_496346]. If the patient is unable to be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] , a 
clinician/provider at their cervical ripening visit will introduce the study to the patient and if they agree  
to be approached, study staff will then approach them for possible enrollment.   Once the patient arrives 
for their scheduled outpatient cervical ripening appointment on CWN3 , CWN5 Labor and Delivery triage,  
or [ADDRESS_496347] about the study previously , a provider/clinician will introduce the 
study to the patient when patient arrives  and ask if study staff can approach them. If the patie nt agrees, 
Mass General Brigham  Institutional Review Board  
Intervention/Interaction Detailed Protocol  
 
Version 2021.[ADDRESS_496348] is being performed (20 -30 minutes) to allow for contemplation then will re -approach the subject to 
confirm if they are or are not interes ted in the study  after NST is complete . After it is confirmed that the 
patient is still candidate for outpatient cervical ripening per standard practice at Brigham and Women’s, 
which requires the non-stress test fetal heart tracing to be reactive, an exam to confirm the cervix needs 
ripening (Bishop score < 6 and cervix < 2cm dilated) and an ultrasound to confirm cephalic presentation, 
they will be randomized to either Dilapan -S or Cook balloon  in a 1:[ADDRESS_496349] their care.  
 
Only adults will be included in the study. Study will be limited to English speaking patients as enrollment 
may happen  day or night and on weekends (given outpatient cervical ripening schedule on labor and 
delivery) when interpreters may not be available. No surrogate decision makers will be allowed to 
consent for patients.  
 
A random number generator will be used to rando mize women in blocks of 6 with stratification 
based on parity (patients who have had a vaginal delivery before or not).  
 
 As randomization will occur after sterile vaginal exam, the examiner obtaining the initial exam 
will be blinded to which arm of the st udy the patient will be in as the exam will be recorded prior to 
randomization. The patient will not be blinded as the devices are different in placement and post -
placement.   
 
 
6. STUDY PROCEDURES  
 
Upon presentation for cervical ripening, a non -stress test will be performed per BWH outpatient 
ripening protocol. Then a sterile vaginal exam will be completed to assign Bishop score, as per standard 
routine. A bedside ultrasound will be completed to confirm fetus is still  in the vertex presentation. The 
patient will then be consented if they have a reactive non -stress test, a Bishop score <6 and cervical 
exam <3cm dilated with confirmed vertex fetus. Once the patient has been consented and randomized,  
the participant will have a Cook catheter or Dilapan -S  by [CONTACT_395072] a speculum, For the 
Cook catheter, t he uterine component of the balloon will be inflated to maximum 60mL , the vaginal 
balloon will not be inflated per standard practice at BWH and per the lite rature that shows slightly 
increased pain and negligible improvement in cervical ripening . The catheter will be taped to the inner 
thigh with gentle traction. For Dilapan -S, 3-[ADDRESS_496350] return precautions per the BWH 
outpatient cervical ripening protocol. With written instructions of who to call/page, with phone number 
listed, list of concerns that should prompt calling / return to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]: Fever > 100.4 F ahrenheit, labor, 
rupture of membranes, reduced fetal movement vaginal bleeding, what to do if the balloon/rods fall 
out, exact time and place to return. Patients must return to labor and delivery within [ADDRESS_496351]  
Intervention/Interaction Detailed Protocol  
 
Version 2021.[ADDRESS_496352] any information about outcomes 
regarding maternal or neonatal morbidity until four weeks from delivery. The patient satisfaction survey 
may be administered until the 6 -week postpartum visit.  Once these items are collected, patient 
participation will end.  
 
Bishop score is defined by 5 components (Figure 3) all assessed during a sterile vaginal exam. 
These individual scores are then combined into a single score (0 -13) to determine the Bishop sc ore. Our 
Mass General Brigham  Institutional Review Board  
Intervention/Interaction Detailed Protocol  
 
Version 2021.[ADDRESS_496353] is change in Bishop score to be calculated as Bishop score after cervical ripening 
minus Bishop score prior to cervical ripening.

 Secondary maternal outcomes will be measured including patient satisfaction with cervical 
ripening method via a survey administered after return to labor and delivery (Appendix B), cesarean 
delivery rate , time from admission on labor and delivery to delive ry, maternal length of stay, and 
indication for cesarean delivery. We will also calculate a composite cervical ripening success score. 
Success will be defined by a lack of any of the following: failure of placement of cervical ripening agent, 
unscheduled r eturn to medical care, rupture of membranes, vaginal bleeding, or need for further 
cervical ripening after the initial agent is removed. We will also calculate a  composite maternal 
morbidity outcome . Morbidity will be defined by [CONTACT_39132]:  high er-order laceration, blood 
transfusion, endometritis, wound infection, venous thromboembolism, hysterectomy, ICU admission or 
death. These outcomes will also be stratified by [CONTACT_147681]. We will also evaluate rates of regional analgesia 
use in both groups.  
 
A composite neonatal morbidity will be calculated including any one of the following: culture -
proven neonatal sepsis, neonatal blood transfusion, hypoxic -ischemic encephalopathy, intraventricular 
hemorrhage grade 3 or 4, or therapeutic hypothermia. We will also analyze NICU admission, NICU 
admission for greater than 48 hours, and neonatal length of stay.  
  
This study design is a non -inferiority randomized control trial with 1:[ADDRESS_496354] deviation of 3 consistent with prior literature. A Type I α 
error of 0.05 was selected. Assuming 80% power and a two -sided P value we would need 39 patients in 
each arm fo r a total of 78 patients; however, prior studies6 reported a 10% failure of placement rate 
(due to patient intolerance of exam or provider failure) to account for this and the small risk of loss to 
follow -up, we will increase the sample size by 15% and wil l include 45 participants in each group for a 
total of 90 participants.  
 
For statistical purposes, intent to treat analysis will be performed. Non -parametric measures will 
be used for statistical analysis. These models will also be adjusted for parity.  
 
10.   Monitoring and Quality Assurance  
 
 The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_395053]. We will not perform any interim analysis, as we feel there is minimal risk from the study 
protocol and would not stop the study early. When adverse events occur,  they will be reported to the 
Partners’ IRB within [ADDRESS_496355]

RE:   Office -Based Ambulatory Cervical Ripening Protocols  
 
 
Updates June 17, 2021  
 
GBS positivity  is no longer an exclusion for office -based ambulatory cervical ripening using a mechanical 
method of cervical ripening, including Foley or Cook balloons, Dilapan or laminaria cervical dilators . 
 
 Mild polyhydramnios is not an exclusion for office -based ambulatory cervical  ripening.  
 
Well -controlled GDM, with or without medications, is not an exclusion for ambulatory office -based 
cervical ripening.  
 
Background:  As noted in a recent Medical Staff note from [CONTACT_60966] ( Cervical Ripening and 
Induction of Labor in Nulliparous  Patients before Forty Weeks’ Gestational Age , #2304)  clinical practice 
Mass General Brigham  Institutional Review Board  
Intervention/Interaction Detailed Protocol  
 
Version 2021.0 6.10  Page 11 of 14 is evolving to increase the use of office -based ambulatory cervical ripening as the initial step  for 
induction of labor in low -risk women from 39 weeks and 0 days gestation through 39 weeks and 6 days 
gestation. One day of office -based ambulatory cervical ripening is an important part of a multi -step 
process that is followed by [CONTACT_395074] (CWN5 Triage) or inpatient cervical ripening, if 
needed, and oxytocin induction of labor . 
 
At BWH we have years of experience with office -based ambulatory cervical ripening using oral 
misoprostol.  Office -based ambulatory mechanical cervical ripening with a balloon catheter (Foley or 
Cook catheters) or Dilapan (hygroscopic cervical dilator) are also effective and safe methods (Alfirevic 
2020, Dong 2020, Yang 2018, Saade 2019). Mechanical methods are particularly suitable for the office -
based ambulatory setting as they are not generally associated with an increased risk of tachysystol e.  
 
The choice of office -based ambulatory  cervical ripening agent is at the provider’s discretion . However , 
we encourage the following:  
(1) First line: Balloon cervical ripening (30 cc Foley or Cook balloon)  
(2) Second line: Dilapan -hygroscopic cervical dilator  
(3) Third line: Oral misoprostol  
 
At this time, we are not endorsing the use of dual agents in the office -based ambulatory setting (e.g. 
balloon or Dilapan plus misoprostol).  
 
Exclusions  (all office -based ambulatory methods of cervical ripening) : 
 
Fetal conditions:  
Contraindication to vaginal delivery (non -vertex presentation, complete placenta previa, etc.)  
IUGR: Growth < 5th percentile  
Abnormal umbilical artery dopplers  
Oligohydramnios or polyhydramnios  (mild polyhydramnios is not an exclusion to ambulatory office -
based cervical ripening)  
Multiple gestation  
Major fetal anomalies  
Induction for the indication of non -reassuring fetal assessment  
Any history of decreased fetal movement  
Any h istory of non -reassuring fetal assessment  
 
Maternal conditions:  
Prior Caesarean delivery or uterine surgery involving removal of a full thickness of uterine tissue  
Clinically significant vaginal bleeding . 
Type1 or Type 2 diabetes mellitus.  (Well -controlle d GDM with or without medication is not a 
contraindication to ambulatory office -based cervical ripening.)  
Significant hypertension: preeclampsia, or taking antihypertensive medications instituted or recently up -
titrated in this pregnancy to control blood p ressure.  
A patient who is unable to understand instructions or return easily should symptoms arise  
 
Exclusion specific to mechanical methods (Foley/Cook/Dilapan):  
GBS positivity  is no longer an exclusion to office -based ambulatory cervical ripening using a mechanical 
method of cervical ripening, including Foley or Cook balloons, Dilapan or laminaria cervical dilators .

Version 2021.0 6.10  Page 12 of 14  
Protocol:  Overall, office -based ambulatory cervical ripening by [CONTACT_395075]5 triage cervical ri pening, if needed, or by [CONTACT_395076] 6 to 24 hours.  
 
Important guidance: An inpatient induction of labor slot should be booked for 6 
to 24 hours following the initiation of office -based ambulatory cervical ripening.  
 
Prior to ripening (all methods):  
1)  Confirm eligibility . Review exclusion criteria above . 
2)  Confirm that an inpatient induction slot is booked at 6 to 24 hours 
followin g the initiation of office -based ambulatory cervical ripening.  
3)  Confirm that clinical testing such as NST or BPP is performed within the appropriate time frame 
(i.e. if weekly fetal testing is indicated, this should be performed within the week prior to  the 
induction or if an ultrasound estimate of fetal weight is indicated this should be performed 
within 2 weeks of the induction).  
4) Confirm cephalic presentation and normal fluid volume. This can be done via formal or bedside 
ultrasound. If a formal ult rasound is performed within the week but not on the day of induction, 
cephalic presentation should be confirmed by [CONTACT_395077].  
 
Prior to ripening (misoprostol only):  
1)  NST must be performed and must be reactive without excessive uterine activity (no more than 2 
contractions in 10 minutes).  
 
Foley Balloon Placement:  
1)  This can be placed in any setting, though ideally in the office -based ambulatory  setting in the 
afternoon.  
2) Either a 30 cc Foley (inflated up to 35 cc) or a Cook catheter can be used.  
3) Balloons can be placed digitally or with a speculum (at provider discretion). If a speculum is 
used, the cervix should be cleansed with betadine prior to placement.  
4)  Only [ADDRESS_496356] Dilapan instead or abandon office -based ambulatory mechanical ripening.   
5) After placement, the Foley catheter tail can be taped to the thigh, tucked into the vagina or tied 
off and trimmed.  
6) No monitorin g is needed after placement.  
7) If the Foley catheter falls out before the scheduled inpatient appointment, the patient should be 
instructed to throw out the Foley catheter. She can stay home until her scheduled appointment 
(unless labor, rupture of membra nes or other concerns require an office or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_21186]).  
 
Dilapan Placement:  
1)  Cervix is visualized with a speculum and cleansed with betadine.  
2) Dilapan rods are placed using a ring forceps. Ideally 3 -5 rods should be placed. No more than 5 
rods should be used. Rods can be moistened with saline or sterile water to aid in placement.  
3) A moistened gauze can be placed in the vagina to help keep the Dilapan in place if desired 
(though not necessary).

Intervention/Interaction Detailed Protocol  
 
Version 2021.0 6.10  Page 13 of 14 4)  The number of Dilapan and gauzes left in the p atient should be clearly documented in the EPIC 
record.  
5) No monitoring is needed after placement.  
6) If the Dilapan(s) or sponge(s) fall out before the scheduled inpatient appointment, the patient 
should be instructed to collect all the rods/sponges in a plastic bag or take a pi[INVESTIGATOR_395058]/sponges and throw them away. She can stay home until her sch eduled appointment 
(unless labor/rupture of membranes or other concerns arise).  
 
Misoprostol Placement:  
1)  50 mcg of oral misoprostol is administered  
2) Patient is monitored by [CONTACT_395078] 1 hour after medication administration.  
 
After Ripening (all methods) : 
1) Patient must be given clear instructions, ideally in writing, including:  
 a) A number to call / page overnight if any concerns arise.  
b) Concerns that should prompt calling / return to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]: Fever > 100.4 Fahrenheit, labor, 
rupture of membranes, r educed fetal movement vaginal bleeding  
c) What to do if the balloon/rods fall out (as above)  
d) When to return

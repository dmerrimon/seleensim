iii PROTOCOL SUMMARY  
Title:  Assessment of mandibular bone invasion with M agnetic Resonance 
Imaging (MRI) using SWeep Imaging with Fourier Transformation 
(SWIFT ) 
Précis: MRI scanning in 3T and 4T MR magnet will be performed on up 
to 20  patients with possible maxillofacial and/or mandibular bone 
invasion by [CONTACT_101509]. We will then compare the conventional imaging results of the patients with 3T and 4T MRI results and post operative pathology results.   
Objectives:  The primary objective of this study is to improve the diagnostic accuracy and specificity of MRI in detecting the degree of bone involvement and invasion in oral cancer. The presence and degree of bone invasion determines the extent of surgery and has great effect on the morbidity of patients with oral cancer and bone/soft tissue tumors. 
 Primary:  To  demonstrate the efficacy  of the MRI scanning in 3T 
and 4T MR magnet for  patients  with squamous  cell carcinoma
 
adjacent  to, or involving,  the mandible.  Comparison will be made  
to histolopathological  sections  as the “gold  standard.”  
Population:  We plan to enroll  [ADDRESS_112379] 
findings  concerning  for mandibular  invasion on physical  
examination or computed tomography  imaging.  Prior to 
surgery,  patients  will be consented  for SWIFT  imaging.  
Imaging  will be conducted during  a seven -day period prior to 
surgery.  
Number of Sites:  University of Minnesota- CMRR  
Study Duration:  Four years  
Subject Participation Duration:  1 ½ hours for the study visit with MRI  
Estimated Time to Complete  3 Years

1 1 INTRODUCTION:  BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND SCIE NTIFIC 
RATIONALE  
1.[ADDRESS_112380] on the morbidity of patients with oral cancer and bone/soft tissue tumors. 
The most important factor in the management is to accurately identify the 
presence of neoplastic invasion.  
Unfortunately , detecting bone invasion and extension of bone involvement prior 
to surgery is often difficult with the currently available imaging techniques. MRI with high contrast resolution and the ability to perform multiplanar imaging plays an integral role in the delineation of tumoral involvement of the bone. Although MRI is an excellent tool in the assessment of bone invasion in carcinoma, its 
overestimation of cortical invasion and tumor extent to the bone marrow have 
been a diagnostic challenge, leading to false positive results. Like many of the musculoskeletal system tissues, cortical bone produces no signal with 
conventional MRI techniques, limiting the characterization of image contrast 
and differentiation of adjacent soft tissues.  
A novel MRI technique called Sweep Imaging with Fourier Transformation (SWIFT) appears to be a suitable tool to overcome this challenge.  The main 
advantage of SWIFT is to obtain signal from the cortical bone. We believe that 
the SWIFT technique will overcome the false positive res ults.   
1.2 Potential Risks and Benefits  
 This study has the following risks :

2 1.2.1  Potential Risks  
Screening Questionnaire  
The questionnaire asks questions that are private in nature.  Also, some people can 
be embarrassed by [CONTACT_42155].  There is a risk that the information from the 
questionnaire could inadvertently be disclosed.  
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)  
MRI is rou tinely used in healthcare to look at tissues in the body. MRI scanners, the 
machines that take these images, have a strong magnetic field and have been cleared by [CONTACT_2165] (FDA) for routine use for patients.  While there are no known health risks associated with these strong magnetic fields, 
some people report dizziness, mild nausea, headache, a metallic taste in the mouth, 
or sensations of flashing lights. These effects have been associated with movement of the head in a strong magnetic field. These symptoms, if present, disappear shortly after leaving the magnet. There are some risks linked with the MRI scanning 
procedure itself, which include:  
1.  Projectile Objects. Objects with magnetic properties, such as metallic objects, 
can be pulled into the magnet. These objects can be dangerous if they are brought 
into the magnet room. By [CONTACT_9377][INVESTIGATOR_101504], we have minimized the chance of this occurring.  
2.  C laustrophobia. Some people may experience claustrophobia (fear of confined 
spaces), while inside the scanner .  Once inside it is possible to  stop the scanning 
and be removed at any time.  Patients  will be given a squeezable device, a bulb, 
which serves as an “emergency” button.  The squeeze bulb will let MRI staff know 
immediately if the patient is  experiencing claustrophobia, and they will terminate the 
scan. The MRI operators will be able to talk during the entire scanning process by [CONTACT_1192]-way earphones and microphone communication system. Patients can also 
press a button inside the scanner to get their attention.  
3. Energy waves. Another risk is presented by [CONTACT_101510]. The power of the energy waves is well below the strength neede d to heat 
the tissue in your body and cause harm,  but any metal in contact [CONTACT_101511]. This is why patients  will be asked to remove all jewelry.  
It is also possible that the scanner will cause peripheral nerve stimulation  
(stimulatio n of the nerves or muscles). If patients  feel any tingling or unusual 
SWIFT MRI Study  Version 2 
IRB: 1210M22261  7/ 27/[ADDRESS_112381] benefits to participation. However, if anything abnormal is found 
and is considered to be a significant finding it will be reported to the patient’s surgeon prior to surgery.

5 3 STUDY DESIGN 
This is a cross- sectional study to be conducted at the University of Minnesota. For this 
study we will enroll patients with possible maxillofacial and/or mandibular bone invasion . 
Patients 18 and older with oral cancer or osteoradionecrosis will be recruited for the 
study prior to their surgery. Subjects will be identified by [CONTACT_101512]/Head and Neck Surgery clinic. Eligible patients will be recruited and consented in the 
Otolaryngology/Head and Neck Surgery clinic during their scheduled appointment. This 
appointment will occur before the patient undergoes surgery for their oral cancer  or 
osteoradionecrosis . Patients that are deemed eligible, after reviewing their medical 
records, will complete the CMRR subject safety screening questionnaire.  
All eligible and consented participants will have MRI scans obtained at the CMRR using the 3T and 4T magnet. Patients will also be asked to sign a HIPPA waiver allowing researchers to access their medical records including their clinical, operative, radiological and pathological findings.

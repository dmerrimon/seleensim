Abstract, paste it here (Click on the orange question mark to the right for more detailed instructions):
VA’s Office of Connected Care has developed two mobile apps for teledermatology – VA Telederm and My 
Telederm.  The proposed research will test the hypothesis that successful implementation of each app 
enhances access of Veterans to dermatologic care. Each mobile app will be rolled out in a stepped wedge 
cluster randomized trial design to sites most likely to benefit.  Outcomes  will be compared for sites that 
have received an app to those that have not yet received it.   Aim 1 (not the focus of this IRB

8.0Research Plan and Procedures
8.1  Describe the hypothesis or what the study hopes to prove: HYPOTHESIS: 
Access to healthcare is currently a key priority for Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  Store-and 
Forward (SFT) Teledermatology has emerged as an important strategy to enhance the access of 
patients to high quality skin care within VA.  The current practice of teledermatology in VA is 
effective but has not been uniformly implemented, and inefficiencies in the current workstation-
based process may discourage teledermatology adoption by [CONTACT_818998].  VA Office of 
Connected Care’s (OCC’s) mobile app, , has been developed as a more facile and VA Telederm
efficient option that may enhance teledermatology adoption among providers.
Once patients establish care in a dermatology clinic, they often need follow-up visits to evaluate 
responses to treatment and to adjust management, neither of which necessarily requires a face-to-face 
visit.  To address these issues, OCC has additionally developed the  app to allow My Telederm
established dermatology clinic patients to follow-up remotely using their own mobile devices.  By 
[CONTACT_818999]-up in person, the app may improve clinic access to in-
person dermatology clinics.
The overall  of this proposal is that sites implementing VA’s teledermatology mobile apps hypothesis
will significantly augment the use of teledermatology and improve Veterans’ access to skin care 
relative to control sites.  Specifically, we hypothesize that  will facilitate the VA Telederm
implementation and adoption of teledermatology among primary care clinic staff, increasing use by 
[CONTACT_819000].  Additionally, we hypothesize that  will improve My Telederm
established patients’ ability to follow-up with dermatology care remotely, while opening up 
dermatology clinic space for other patients. 
8.[ADDRESS_1134157] the specific aims: AIMS: 
Aim 1. Measure impact of apps on access to dermatology care.  San Francisco VA Health Care
System's involvement is limited in Aim 1.  All data related to this aim is collected by [CONTACT_41309]’
s Center for Access Policy, Evaluation Research (CAPER) located at the [LOCATION_011] VA Health Care 
System.  All data collected from the Corporate Data Warehouse, or any other databases as 
approved by [CONTACT_819001], aggregated, 
and shared with investigators and study staff at the San Francisco VA Health Care System and 
other sites.  No analysis of the primary data will occur at San Francisco VA.  
Both apps will be made available over a 2 year period in a randomized, stepped-wedge design to 
Veterans Health Administration (VHA) facilities, after each app becomes available.  The VA 
 app will be distributed to [ADDRESS_1134158] relatively mature 
teledermatology programs ready for advanced operations.
By [CONTACT_819002], we will use the VA Corporate Data 
Warehouse (CDW) to measure the impact of both apps on the following outcomes reflecting 
dermatology access: 1) Consult and appointment completion times for both teledermatology and in-
person consults, stratified by [CONTACT_819003] (primary outcome); 2) Instances of 
dermatologic care (associated with either teledermatology or in-person dermatology encounters); and 
3) Travel costs for VA, as well as non-VA care consult rates and associated costs.  In addition, the
following outcomes will be measured specifically for the  app:  1) Proportions of new My Telederm
patient encounters in-person dermatology clinics ; and 2) “No-show” rates and timeliness of follow-
up.  Results of each of these access measures will be stratified to examine the effect on rural/highly
rural Veterans, as well as to determine whether a differential effect occurs for facilities with some pre-
existing teledermatology relative to those that had none.
Aim 2. Determine the factors that affect personal and organizational adoption of mobile apps .  
Using the Replicating Effective Programs framework, we will work with OCC to implement and 
measure the deployment, adoption and utilization of both teledermatology apps throughout all 
eligible VA sites. , we  In one sub-aim, which is the principal focus of the current IRB application
will conduct a formative evaluation of the implementation process at 3 early adopter sites to develop 
implementation strategies to guide subsequent nationwide deployment and research.  Surveys and 
semi-structured interviews will assess Organizational Readiness for Change (ORC) at these sites 
regarding the apps, and link ORC to stages of implementation, barriers and facilitators to 
implementation, and implementation effectiveness as measured by [CONTACT_819004]. 
In the second sub-aim, we will also monitor deployment, adoption and utilization of both 
teledermatology apps nationally by [CONTACT_819005].  The
primary data will be collected by [CONTACT_819006], and aggregate data will be 
.  We will then correlate the degree of adoption with reach of shared with the PIs and co-investigators
the program (i.e., number of Veterans served) and stratify analyses of primary outcomes from Aim [ADDRESS_1134159] to document important indicators of mobile 
teledermatology’s effects on patient access in the nation’s largest healthcare system and to 
comprehensively understand the implementation of mobile teledermatology.  These novel 
achievements will guide future mobile telemedicine endeavors in VA, and will inform other large 
healthcare organizations interested in telehealth.
8.3  Briefly describe the study design (e.g., observational, interventional, randomized, placebo- DESIGN: 
controlled, blinded, cross-over, cross-sectional, longitudinal, pharmacokinetic, etc.):   
 is anticipated to be ready for national release in January 2017 and My Telederm in the spring of VA Telederm
2018, as part of VA's Office of Connected Care operations. Beforehand, technical field testing will occur at San 
Francisco, Providence and Denver VHA facilities.  For national rollout, each app will be targeted to sites that are 
clinically appropriate and best positioned to benefit from the app.  Within these sites, the apps will be released in 
three month intervals according to allow a cross-sectional stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial for each 
app.  We anticipate the affected population will represent VA’s as a whole.
The impact of teledermatology apps depends not only on their intrinsic effectiveness, but also on successful 
implementation and adoption by [CONTACT_819007]-users as possible who then maintain the 
practice.  Outcomes may be organized within the RE-AIM Framework, which encompasses multiple domains 
necessary for translating innovation into real-world practice.  The Reach and Effectiveness domains are 
addressed in Aim 1; The Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance domains are the focus of Aim 2.
Aim 1 will assess each app’s effect on Veterans’ access to dermatology in a stepped-wedge cluster randomized 
trial. Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW) data pertaining to access will be collected remotely by [CONTACT_819008], Evaluation and REsearch (CAPER) under its own IRB approval.  Multiple measures reflecting 
different aspects of access will be evaluated to achieve a comprehensive and accurate evaluation of each app’s 
impact.  Aim 2 will focus on measuring the degree to which each app was implemented.  Using semi-quantitative 
interviews and surveys of key VA  staff members at the three early adopter sites (San Francisco, Denver and 
Providence VA Medical Centers) involved in technical testing as well as data in CDW and OCC databases, we 
will monitor implementation and identify organizational, individual, and app-specific factors that affect each app’s 
overall impact. 
8.4   Briefly provide the background and significance of this study (e.g. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE:
 why is this study needed) (space limit: one half page):
Telehealth and mobile health are rapi[INVESTIGATOR_818989], as well as in the private sector.  Teledermatology has been adopted by 
[CONTACT_819009]-profit health care organizations as well as by [INVESTIGATOR_8178]-profit companies and individual practices.  The 
use of mobile apps in teledermatology is in a relatively early phase and it is important to validate their 
effectiveness in promoting teledermatology in diverse populations, and understand how best to integrate them 
into clinical operations.  The proposed research is expected to have the following impacts:
Tele Assess the ability of mobile teledermatology to bring expert dermatologic care to new populations.  
dermatology has been well-studied with respect to its diagnostic and management reliability, and clinical 
outcomes.  Its ability to enhance access to skin care has also been documented.  However, little is known about 
the ability of teledermatology to expand the number of patients served, especially to those in underserved 
areas.  Less is known about the effect of teledermatology on the performance of a healthcare system.  The 
integrated nature and size of VA’s teledermatology program offers an unparalleled opportunity to study the effect 
of the teledermatology intervention on patient access in the largest healthcare system in the [LOCATION_002], as 
well as to study implementation of apps on a large scale.  The proposed project will document the ability of VA 
 to expand consultative teledermatology within existing programs and to new VA CBOCs.  This Telederm
information will be particularly important to health care organizations responsible for large, geographically 
diverse populations in rural or otherwise remote areas.
.  Historically, teledermatology has been principally Validate a new model for enhancing access to patients
practiced as a consultative tool where a PCP requests guidance from a dermatologist.  The preponderance of 
published research has similarly focused on consultative teledermatology.  However, with the widespread 
availability of digital cameras and internet access, the ability to accept teledermatology consultations directly 
from patients has increasingly emerged in commercial ventures but with little scientific validation of their actual 
impact on healthcare. Within VA, there has also recently been an evolution toward delivering healthcare 
centered in patients’ homes, and OCC has begun live-interactive telehealth encounters with patients in their 
homes.  The effect of this type of telehealth is unknown.  The  app will be VA’s first attempt to bring My Telederm
store-and-forward telehealth into patients homes and may have significant impacts on not only the patients that 
it directly serves, but also indirect effects on new patients who need to be seen in person in clinics and who may 
benefit from the additional capacity created by [CONTACT_819010]-up remotely.  The 
proposed research seeks to measure the magnitude of this effect.
.  Implementation and adoption of Understand factors affecting successful implementation of mobile apps
telehealth, including teledermatology, in the VHA has proven to be a slow and heterogeneous effort, having 
taken over [ADDRESS_1134160] with clinical care of patients, are rolled out in the 
future.  Additionally, we believe that studying the process within the paradigm of OTIE and the REP framework 
will allow the findings to be broadly applicable to other healthcare organizations.
8.5  Briefly summarize any preliminary studies relevant to your proposed PRELIMINARY STUDIES: 
research : (space limit: one half page)
The proposed research is to assess the implementation and impact of mobile apps that are in the final stages of 
development, validation and checks for compliance with VA's privacy and safety requirements.  In anticipation of 
the stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial, all VA facilities were examined for teledermatology activity relative 
to total dermatology activity.  
The inclusion criterion for the first trial ( ) was that a site had a minimum of 0.1% and < 8.8% of its VA Telederm
total FY2016 dermatology encounters under secondary stop codes 695/696 (teledermatology readings).  VA 
medical centers with no 695/696 activity in FY2016 or with zero full-time equivalent dermatologists were 
excluded since these sites likely lack the expertise, support and infrastructure to feasibly adopt teledermatology 
during the study period. In total, we identified 36 sites eligible for , teledermatology constituting VA Telederm
between 0.1% and 8.8% of all dermatology encounters.
Conversely, the inclusion criterion for the second trial with was that a site had ≥8.8% of all FY2016 My Telederm 
dermatology encounters under secondary stop codes 695/696.  This indicated considerable pre-existing 
experience with consultative teledermatology and the likely presence of dermatology reader and support 
personnel needed to implement . We identified 24 sites where teledermatology constituted 8.8% to My Telederm
100% of total encounters. 
In Aim 1, apps will be disseminated according to the stepped-wedge cluster randomization scheme 
determined by [CONTACT_819011], but otherwise is under the control of VA's Office of Connected Care as 
part of its operational plan to disseminate the apps to the clinical field.  The main outcomes are measures 
that serve as proxies for access to dermatology services, and these are stored in VA's Corporate Data 
Warehouse (CDW) which is remotely accessbie.

In , no patient contact [CONTACT_819012].  Primary data for this Aim will Aim 1
be obtained by [CONTACT_20248]'s CAPER under its own IRB authorization and will be stored at the CAPER's [LOCATION_011] VA 
facility.  Aggregate data will be shared by [CONTACT_819013]-investigators.  
In , technical field-testing prior to the start of the proposed study is a planned necessary step for  Aim 2
VA's Office of Connected Care's clinical operations.  Both  and  will be field-tested VA Telederm My Telederm
by [CONTACT_819014], Denver and Providence VHA facilities and thus these sites cannot participate in 
the randomized study of Aim 1.  However, as early adopters, these sites will be designated for formative 
evaluation in Sub-Aim 2.1.  While these intensive studies cannot be conducted at all sites, we will monitor 
enterprise-wide implementation, adoption and maintenance using remotely accessible measures in Sub-
Aim 2.2.
Sub-Aim 2.1:  Formative Evaluation
This Sub-Aim's activities are the principal focus of the current IRB application.  We will conduct an in-
depth, theory-based formative evaluation of the three early adopter sites (same as technical field-testing 
sites), with the goals of understanding: 1) Factors that may impact ORC and implementation of the 
teledermatology apps; 2) Changes in these factors over the course of one year; and 3) Association 
between ORC to both successful implementation and sustainability over time.  We will utilize a mixed 
methods approach to measure ORC and change in related components over time.  The ultimate goal is to 
inform the process of implementing both teledermatology apps during the randomized implementation and 
among sites not part of the randomization process.  Further, we will inform the implementation of future 
mobile clinical applications.
Survey data will be collected centrally using REDCap, hosted by [CONTACT_68839] 
(VIReC) and housed on a VA Informatics and Computing Infrastructure (VINCI) server at VA's Austin 
Infomration Techology Center.  Interview data will be collected by [CONTACT_819015], using MS Teams and Phillips recorder.
Site Selection for Formative Evaluation.   In addition to their initial roles in field-testing, the three early 
adopter sites—San Francisco, Denver and Providence VA Medical Centers—are appropriate for evaluation 
since their primary care and dermatology leadership as well as CBOCs are willing to participate.  These 
sites may have specific qualities that impact implementation.  However, since they vary in terms of both 
organization and location, lessons learned will likely translate to the mix of other VA facilities with 
dermatology programs.
Formative evaluation process  
Brief summary
The formative evaluation will begin by [CONTACT_819016] (Site Process Guide is attached to this application).  This will be followed 
by:
[CONTACT_819017] (to be determined by [CONTACT_819018]; the email consent script and ORC survey, and telephone consent script and 
initial interview guide are attached to this application).
Bi-monthly (every other month) monitoring of the implementation process and progress (Bi-
monthly Site Report is attached to this application).
Qualitative interviews addressing implementation factors suggested by [CONTACT_819019] 6-8 months 
following initial implementation of teledermatology (The follow-up interview guide will be developed 
based on the initial evaluations in (1) and (2) and will be submitted as a modification to this 
protocol).

this application, the sustainability interview guide will be developed based on (1), (2), and (3) and 
will be submitted as a modification to this protocol.)
     Each section of the formative evaluation is independent of the other, except when specifically 
noted.  We are examining the perceptions of specific groups of individuals based on their roles within VA 
medical centers, as opposed to being based on the individual person.   Furthermore since the apps are 
being released at different times, aside from the site information report the steps will be done separately 
for each app. The staff using the two teledermatology mobile apps are different. Steps of the formative 
evaluation process are summarized below.
Collection of Baseline Characteristics that may impact implementation .  The three VA sites at San 
Francisco, Denver and Providence will be asked by [CONTACT_819020], Providence, and 
Durham VA sites using the Site Information Report to identify individuals (research subjects) directly 
involved in planning and execution of app implementation.  These individuals make up the core 
 which may vary among the sites, and has not yet been exactly defined at each implementation team
site, including San Francisco VA, but may include those that function in the following roles:
Facility Telemedicine Coordinators
Primary Care Clinical Champi[INVESTIGATOR_818990] (CACs)
Teledermatology Readers
Additionally, the three sites will identify  whose work or clinical decision-making may other staff
change as a result of app implementation.  These individuals are:
Primary Care Clinicians
Telehealth Clinical Technicians/Telehelath Imagers
Dermatology Clinicians
Other staff at the three early adopter sites whose work may be affected by [CONTACT_819021].
Detailed description of formative evaluation
The Principal Investigators will be asked to complete and provide San Francisco VA HCS research staff with 
a  for each of the early adopter sites.  This document will be used to baseline site information document
identify core implementation team members and other staff involved in teledermatology and their 
relationships among each other, as well as teledermatology processes, size and composition of each 
medical centers, and impacted clinical services.  We may supplement this information be examining 
organizational-level information (e.g., number of patients, number of providers) that is normally available 
to all VA employees through the VHA Reports and Measures Portal (RAMP) and/or VHA Report Services 
Center (VSSC).
Upon completion of the baseline site information document, the following specific steps will be 
overseen by [CONTACT_819022].
Measurement of ORC.   At each site, core implementation team members and other staff from 
impacted services will receive the validated Organization Readiness for Implementing Change 
, a 12-item computer-based ORC survey which examines perceptions of organizational- measure
level change efficacy and commitment to newly implemented interventions.  The ORC survey is 
submitted in its entirety as an attachment to application, along with the email consent script that 
will introduce the research subject to it and the consent process.  In brief, survey questions ask 
participants to indicate their perceptions on the level of confidence that organizational 
members have in effecting changes in teledermatology operations using each of the mobile 
apps.  Survey responses will objectively examine ORC as a two-dimensional construct 
encompassing change commitment and change efficacy.  This instrument was developed specifically 
to measure aspects of the Weiner Theory of ORC.  In addition, San Francisco research staff will 
conduct  of the core implementation semi-structured qualitative telephone individual interviews
team, 3 PCPs, 3 dermatologists, 2 dermatology staff members, as well as leadership positions 
overseeing and supporting teledermatology operations at the site (e.g., Network telehealth lead, 
Chief of Dermatology, Associate Chief of Staff for Ambulatory Care, informatics leads, IT specialists) 
at each site to assess ORC and factors that are hypothesized to predict ORC (i.e. change valance
/value place on the apps and assessment of what it will take to implement the apps).  These semi-
structured interviews following the initial guide will allow us to study implementation processes, 
which tend to be fluid, non-linear, and context sensitive and will permit us to compare patterns

application.
Bi-monthly Monitoring of Implementation – Process of Implementation .  At the start of 
each app implementation, the research team will interview the core implementation team as a 
group during a conference call after obtaining verbal consent (the telephone consent script and Site 
Process Guide are attached to this application).  Baseline information on the site's process of 
implementing each app and related clinical workflow will be collected through a series of questions 
based on expected workflow, such as identifying essential tasks in IT and informatics as well as 
staff training that need to occur.  Additionally, we will collect baseline information on the 
organization of dermatology services, the referral process from PCPs, number of providers, and 
perceived volume of patients.  Components of the workflow process will be stored in an Excel 
spreadsheet to be sent to the sites for updates every two months. 
Bi-monthly Monitoring of Implementation – Implementation Progress .  We will also 
measure the implementation process by  [CONTACT_819023]-monthly site reports
sites.  Implementation progress will be assessed utilizing the Stages of Implementation Completion 
(SIC).  SIC enumerates key pre-implementation, implementation and sustainability milestones. 
Dates by [CONTACT_819024].  Bi-monthly 
(every other month) reports will also include assessment of barriers and facilitators identified 
through the ORC measurement process.  Bi-monthly information will be fed back to project and 
OCC leadership so that program adjustments can be made.  The Bi-Monthly Site Report survey is 
attached to this application.
Evaluation of the Implementation Process – Qualitative Interviews.  At 6-[ADDRESS_1134162] the information obtained in the initial baseline 
studies above, but will in general allow participants to expand on the same areas covered by [CONTACT_224361]-
monthly site report survey that is attached, and described in (3) above.  The follow-up interview 
will be introduced by [CONTACT_819025].
Assessment of Sustainability.   At one year, we will assess the sustainability of use of each of the 
mobile apps. 
The Mancini & Marek Model of Community-based Program Sustainability will be used to 
conceptually guide the evaluation of sustainability.  Mancini & Marek propose that six 
elements are important to achieve long-term sustainability:  Leadership competence, 
effective collaboration, demonstrating program results, strategic funding, staff involvement 
and integration, and program responsivity.  The validated Program Sustainability Index (PSI)
measures each of the 6 sustainability elements, and is attached to this application.  Each 
core implementation team member and director of primary care and dermatology will be 
surveyed for each app.  
Using the  above, each core implementation team semi-structured interview methods
member, director of primary care, Chief of Dermatology, FTC, imager, and other staff 
members participating in processing or supporting teledermatology at each site will be 
interviewed.  The sustainability interview will explore in more depth the areas surveyed in 
the PSI (Leadership, Collaboration, Demonstrating Program Results, Funding, and Program 
Responsivity.  We have previously used the combination of PSI and qualitative interviews to 
evaluate the sustainability of a multi-facility program for the Office of Patient Centered Care 
and Cultural Transformation.  This  program sustainability interview guide will be introduced 
by [CONTACT_819025].
Sub-Aim 2.2
Implementation of field sites will also be assessed at all participating sites by [CONTACT_819026]’s 
own telehealth database and Web and Mobile Solutions (WMS) device procurement program. 
To understand how rapi[INVESTIGATOR_818991] a result of the OCC implementation process, and 
if the apps are more effective among sites that have reached more implementation milestones, 
randomized sites will be asked to complete a bi-monthly implementation site report monitoring key 
milestones, collected electronically via REDCAP on the VA intranet.  This bi-monthly report is based on 
the bi-monthly site report utilized as part of the formative evaluation described above.  Sites will be sent 
email reminders two weeks and one week prior to, and one week after the due date, with follow up via 
phone call, if necessary.  Four of these randomized sites will be recruited to participate in semi-structured 
sustainability interviews using the same guides used in the formative evaluation and will be introduced by 
[CONTACT_819025]. These Interview data will be collected by 
[CONTACT_819027], 
using MS Teams and Phillips recorder.

research: (REQUIRED)
  Yes     No
8.13  Briefly summarize the methods and types of analyses that will be STATISTICAL METHODS: 
performed:
Aim 1-Due to a lack of participation by [CONTACT_819029] (COVID-19) pandemic, we were not ale to follow the analysis plan for Aim 1 described below.  
Instead we focused on understanding factors associated with successful completion of consults with the mobile 
apps, examining differences between rural and urban Veteran users. 
Data analysis. Primary data will be collected and analyzed by [CONTACT_819030].  Stepped wedge - cluster randomized trials (SW-CRTs) need to employ data 
analysis strategies that account for the causal structure implied by [CONTACT_819031]. Two related issues which may confound the treatment effect are the within-cluster correlation and 
potentially significant secular trends in the outcomes of interest given the long duration of the trials (2.5 years). 
In fact, the exposure of each cluster to both the control and intervention allows the researcher to partially exploit 
the within cluster variance towards estimation, which renders this type of trial less sensitive to the intra-cluster 
correlation coefficient. To further ensure that these confounding factors are properly handled, we will analyze 
the data using mixed models that allow for time fixed effects and cluster random effects.
Second, we are interested in the average effect of the treatment among compliers (patients who only receive the 
treatment as a direct result of their exposure to the intervention), referred to as the Local Average Treatment 
Effect (LATE). This effect better reflects the efficacy of teledermatology compared to regular practice. In order to 
estimate LATE, we will follow an instrumental variable (IV)-based two-stage residual inclusion (2SRI) procedure. 
Finally, we will also conduct an intent-to-treat analysis, yielding an estimate of the average effect of being 
randomized to receive one of the telederm apps (average treatment effect). From a policy perspective, this 
effect can be interpreted as the efficacy of deploying an app in real-world outpatient clinics, where overall uptake 
to clinical practice is likely less than 100%. 
Aim 2
.  Core to the concept of formative evaluation is continual analysis of Sub-Aim 2.1:  Formative Data Analysis
results and feedback to stakeholders.  That will be done in this formative evaluation.  Key data sources are 
qualitative interviews, surveys to assess ORC, and collection of detail about organizational characteristics and 
implementation process and progress.  All qualitative interviews will be transcribed in full.  Rapid analysis 
approaches will generate preliminary findings to share among the research team.  This effort will involve an 
initial review of factors identified as directly impacting the process of supporting app implementation and impact 
of the apps on clinical workflow.  Rapid analysis will be followed by [INVESTIGATOR_2993]-depth content analysis.  Content analysis 
to examine the telephone interviews will involve three phases: data coding, within-case analysis, and between-
case analysis.  In the , we will use qualitative data analysis software (ATLAS.ti 5.0) to code data coding phase
the study data. The OTIE will provide a starting list of codes, which we will supplement with emergent codes as 
analysis proceeds. Using a common codebook, two investigators will conduct a preliminary test of codes by 
[CONTACT_819032]. Based on the preliminary test, the investigators will sharpen the coding 
manual’s definitions, decision rules, and examples. Research assistants will code the remaining documents. 
In the second phase, we will conduct a  of each VA using ATLAS.ti to generate reports of all within-case analysis
text segments for each code. We will assess the degree to which the construct emerges in the data (its 
“strength”), the degree to which the construct positively or negatively affects implementation (its “valence”), and 
the degree to which relationships among constructs are consistent with the hypothesized model.  We will assess 
support for the hypothesized relationships by [CONTACT_819033].  First, we will look for the overall covariance of the constructs (e.g., whether VA clinics exhibiting 
strong implementation climate have supportive administration).  Second, we will look for explicit attributions or 
the identification of plausible mechanisms to link the two constructs (e.g., participants attribute a strong 
implementation climate to the deployment of appropriate implementation policies and practices). 
In the third phase, we will apply the same criteria across the cases to determine if  variation in cross-case
implementation is consistent with the hypothesized relationships in the model. Consistent with the organization-
level focus of the model, we will aggregate and analyze quantitative data on implementation policies and 
practices (e.g. staffing levels) and other study constructs using simple statistics. In addition, we will create within-
case and between-case data displays that cross-tabulate the quantitative and qualitative data in order to 
facilitate the use of pattern-matching logic.
:  Collection of this data will be descriptively summarized to understand how rapi[INVESTIGATOR_818992]-Aim 2.2
milestones as a result of the OCC implementation process, correlate the milestones to the number of patients 
serviced via the apps (i.e., reach), and allow for stratified analyses of main quantitative study results by [CONTACT_819034]. We will analyze the qualitative data from the interviews in the 
same manner as described above for the formative evaluations using direct content analysis to examine themes 
within each case and to determine cross-case variation.

Aim [ADDRESS_1134167] the diversity of VA’s patient population with respect 
to age, gender, race and ethnicity.  Children will be excluded since VHA does not serve pediatric 
populations and since children are not a target population for the apps.  
 
, as part of formative evaluation, will involve structured interviews and surveys of VHA staff at three Aim 2
early adopter sites, including VISN and facility organizational leadership (VISN Telehealth Leads, 
Dermatology Chiefs, Facility Telehealth Coordinators), support staff (Information Security Officers, Clinical 
Application Coordinators, Information Technology specialists), and clinical end-users (primary care 
providers, Telehealth Clinical Technicians, dermatologists) and clinical support staff (Medical Support 
Assistants).   Thus we anticipate 16-[ADDRESS_1134168] the composition and diversity of VHA’s workforce. For sub aim 2.2, [ADDRESS_1134169] high usage of the app and two with low to no usage of the app.

10.3  Explain how and why the number of people was chosen. For multi-site SAMPLE SIZE JUSTIFICATION: 
studies, this is referring to the number that will be enrolled across all sites:
In , the number of participating medical center facilities (clusters) was determined as follows:  The Aim [ADDRESS_1134170] trial ( ) was that a site had a minimum of 0.1% and < 8.8% of VA Telederm
its total FY 2016 dermatology encounters were attributable to teledermatology (stop codes 695/696).  We 
also used clinical FTE data from FY [ADDRESS_1134171] some 
dermatologists on staff available. VA medical centers with no teledermatology activity in FY 2016 or with 
zero full-time equivalent dermatologists were excluded.  In total, we identified 36 sites eligible for VA 
.  Conversely, the inclusion criterion for the second trial with was that a site had ≥8. Telederm My Telederm 
8% of all FY [ADDRESS_1134172] conservative differences of 10% from

In , as described in 10.1 above, we anticipate that 16-17 subjects will be enrolled for formative Aim 2
evaluation at each of the three sites (San Francisco, Denver and Providence).  Each job title has been 
selected since it will either play be end-users of the mobile app program (e.g., primary care provider or 
imager or dermatologist), or be important support staff or mediators (e.g., Clinical Application Coordinator, 
program support assistants), or will be important leadership whose buy-in is necessary for successful 
implementation (clinical leadership). Sub aim 2.[ADDRESS_1134173] not will provide additional insight into the facilitators and

12.0  Risks and Benefits
12.1  Check if your study involves any of these specific research-related risks RESEARCH-RELATED RISKS: 
to participants that may need to be disclosed in the consent form:
Physical discomforts or pain
Risks to employment, or social or legal standing
Risk that the study team may observe possible evidence of child abuse, elder abuse, or a threat to self 
or others that they are required to report
For any boxes checked above, describe how you will minimize these risks and * 
discomforts, e.g., adding or increasing the frequency of monitoring, additional 
screening to identify and exclude people with diminished kidney or liver function, 
or modification of procedures such as changing imaging studies to avoid giving 
contrast agent to people who are more likely to suffer side effects from it, etc.: 
(REQUIRED)
For , the risk is minimal as there is no subject contact [CONTACT_819039]-Aim 1
identifiable information by [CONTACT_20248]'s CAPER under its own IRB approval.
 
For ,Aim 2
There is a small risk of losing anonymity through the use of demographic or job title information.  
Some individuals may feel self-conscious or embarrassed if asked questions about something with which they are 
unfamiliar,  and they may be concerned that their responses will become known to colleagues and supervisors.
12.2  Describe any anticipated risks and discomforts not listed above: RISKS: * (REQUIRED)
None
12.3  
MINIMIZING RISKS: Describe the steps you have taken to minimize the risks/discomforts to 
subjects. Examples include:
designing the study to make use of procedures involving less risk when appropriate
minimizing study procedures by [CONTACT_25943] a plan for evaluation and possible referral of subjects who report suicidal ideation
For , there is no subject contact [CONTACT_819040] [ADDRESS_1134184] access to any data. 
12.5  BENEFITS: * (REQUIRED)  Note: These are the benefits that the IRB will consider during their review. 
They are not necessarily appropriate to include in the consent form.
Possible immediate and/or direct benefits to participants and society at 
large (check all that apply):
Positive health outcome (e.g. improvement of condition, relief of pain, increased mobility, etc.)
Closer follow-up than standard care may lead to improved outcomes or patient engagement
Health and lifestyle changes may occur as a result of participation
Knowledge may be gained about their health and health conditions
Feeling of contribution to knowledge in the health or social sciences field
The research presents a reasonable opportunity to further the understanding, prevention, or alleviation 
of a serious problem affecting the health or welfare of children
Other benefit (describe below)
None
Briefly discuss the other possible benefits:
Participation may lead to knowledge that will help the subject and others in their jobs in the 
future.  Specifically, knowledge may be gained about organizational factors involved in the implementation 
of telehealth programs and technology that may facilitate future programs in which the subject may be 
involved.
12.6  Explain why the risks to subjects are reasonable in relation to anticipated RISK TO BENEFIT RATIO: 
benefits, if any, to the participant or society:
The formative evaluation will allow monitoring of the apps in detail at the pi[INVESTIGATOR_185911], and if 
safety issues are identified, will allow corrections to be made before most other sites have 
been exposed the apps.  The benefits of understanding organizational and individual factors 
that affect implementation of new processes in VA are considerable given that VA will likely 
undertake similar implementations of other interventions in the future.  The principal risk of 
inadvertently revealing employees attitudes and knowledge of the process to peers and 
supervisors is minimal in absolute terms and in relation to the potential benefit to VA.

13.0  
Data and Safety Monitoring Plan
13.1  DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING PLAN (DSMP): * (REQUIRED)  Provide a summary of the DSMP:
All greater than minimal risk studies are required to provide a plan. Lack 
of an adequate plan is one of the most common reasons why IRB approval 
is delayed.
 
Instructions:
Describe the plan for monitoring data quality and participant safety. Key areas that 
should be included in the plan are:
An explanation of the plan to monitor data collection, study progress, and 
safety
A description of who will perform the monitoring and at what frequency (e.g., 
the PI [INVESTIGATOR_13701], a contract research organization, a Data and Safety Monitoring 
Board or Data Monitoring Committee, etc.)
The type of data and events that will be reviewed (e.g., adverse events, 
breaches of confidentiality, unanticipated problems involving risk to 
participants or others, unblinded efficacy data, etc.)
Procedures and timeline for communicating monitoring results to the UCSF 
IRB, the study sponsor, and other appropriate entities
As appropriate:
A plan for conducting and reporting interim analysis
Clearly defined stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_818993]:
 
For , data monitoring is done by [CONTACT_819006].  Aggregate data will also be Aim 1
reviewed by [CONTACT_819041]' 
meeting with Office of Connected Care in Washington, DC.  However, this will be performed in consultation 
with VA's Office of Connected Care which is responsible for the overall implementation of the mobile apps 
throughout VA, and has its own independent Quality Improvement team to monitor implementation and 
safety.
 
For , local monitoring includes the following:Aim [ADDRESS_1134186] interactions are 
appropriate and safe, and that the data collected by [CONTACT_819042].  Interview data will be collected by [CONTACT_819043]. Data from these interviews will 
be stored on the Research (R:) drive of the San Francsico VA Health Care System server.
Survey data will be collected centrally using REDCap, hosted by [CONTACT_819044] (VIReC) and housed on a VA Informatics and Computing Infrastructure (VINCI) server at 
VA's Austin Infomration Techology Center.  Data is backed up nightly and every [ADDRESS_1134187] access to PHI at the user level if needed, and limit 
access between different sites' data within multi-site studies if needed.
Events triggering PI [INVESTIGATOR_818994]:  Complaints generated by [CONTACT_819045], change in employment status of research subjects identified by [CONTACT_3647] (e.g., 
inability to administer follow-up interviews with research subjects due to transfer to new jobs or 
lack of response), and real or suspected loss of data or breach of subject confidentiality.
If PIs identify issues with patient safety or confidentiality, the PIs will notify the local VA Research 
Office, UCSF's IRB as well as VA Office of Research and Development will be notified per VA 
protocol.  Minor issues in data quality and project progress will be addressed directly with the site
(s) involved, as well as during biweekly conference calls among all the investigators and/or during 
the annual investigators' meeting in Washington, DC.

Guidelines
  A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) or Data Monitoring Committee 
(DMC) is a formal, independent committee that is specifically established to 
conduct interim monitoring, oversight and analysis of study information and data 
to assure the continuing safety, efficacy, appropriateness, relevance, and integrity 
of the study.
   
  The UCSF IRB reserves the right to request a DSMB/DMC for any study. However, 
the following are factors that the IRB will consider when making this determination:
 
There is a significant likelihood of a serious adverse event to subjects
The study is conducted at multiple sites and the level of risk is greater than 
minimal
The study generates data that are blinded or randomized
The study involves a large number of patients randomized to one of two or 
more interventions
A study for which the performance of an interim analysis is crucial for the 
protection of the subjects
First use in humans
First use in children
The study involves gene therapy, stem cell therapy, or other novel 
interventions for which long-term outcome data are not known or available
14.[ADDRESS_1134189] privacy will be protected: PROTECTING PRIVACY: 
Conduct conversations about the research in a private room
Ask the subject how they wish to be communicated with – what phone numbers can be called, can 
messages be left, can they receive mail about the study at home, etc.
Take special measures to ensure that data collected about sensitive issues do not get added to their 
medical records or shared with others without the subject’s permission
Other methods (describe below)
14.2  Do any of the instruments ask about illegal or stigmatized behavior: SENSITIVE DATA: 
  Yes     No

14.3  Could a breach of SIGNIFICANT CONSEQUENCES OF A LOSS OF PRIVACY OR CONFIDENTIALITY: 
privacy or confidentiality result in any significant consequences to participants, such as criminal or 
civil liability, loss of state or federal benefits, or be damaging to the participant's financial standing, 
employability, or reputation:
 Yes    No
Check all that apply:
Embarrassment
Criminal or civil liability
Loss of state or federal benefits
Damaging to the participant's financial standing, employability, or reputation
Potential risks to insurability (health, disability, or life insurance)
Describe the potential consequences:
For , the research will record employees' attitudes or knowledge about telehealth, mobile apps, Aim 2
teledermatology or broader VA-related issues.  It is possible that loss of privacy/confidentiality regarding 
this data could prove embarrassing or damaging to reputations for employees if released to peers or 
supervisors.  In such cases, some employees may feel job insecurity. 
14.4  Explain any extra steps that will be taken to assure EXTRA CONFIDENTIALITY MEASURES: 
confidentiality and protect identifiable information from improper use and disclosure, if any:
For , subjects at one site will be interviewed by [CONTACT_819046].  For Aim [ADDRESS_1134190] information will 
be kept on encrypted local computers temporarily and saved on the San Francisco VA 
Medical Center's R: drive server. Survey data will also reside on the San Francisco VA 
Medical Center's R: drive server.  Study results will be reported in aggregate.  Data and 
results collected from individual VA employees will not be reported outside of individuals 
included on the study staff list.  As a result, individual-level data/results collected from 
individual VA employees will not be shared with colleagues, supervisors, or other VA 
stakeholders.  Research records will be retained in accordance with the VHA Records 
Control Schedule.

 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 14 of 66 1 INTRODUCTION  
1.1 Dry Eye Disease (DED)  
Dry Eye Disease (DED) is defined by [CONTACT_72068] (DEWS) as a 
multifactorial disease of the ocular surface characterized by a loss of homeostasis of the 
tear film, and accompanied by [CONTACT_72069], in which tear film instability and 
hyperosmolarity, ocular surface inflammation and damage, and neurosensory 
abnormalities play etiological roles  (DEWS II Definition and Classification 2017).  As 
many as 5 - 35% of patients v isiting ophthalmic clinics report dry eye symptoms, making 
it one of the most common conditions seen by [CONTACT_72070] (McCarty CA, et al. 
1998; Lin PY, et al. 2003). Estimates range from 20 million people in the [LOCATION_002] 
(US) being affected with mild to moderate dry eye, to a high of as many as one out of every 
five Americans. Prevalence is greater in females and the elderly. Schaumberg et al . 
reported pr evalence rates ranging from 3.9% in men aged 50 –54 years to 7.7% in those 80 
years or older, while an increased rate from 5.7% in women younger than 50 years to 9.8% 
in women >75 years was observed (Schaumberg DA, et al. 2003). Prevalence is affected 
by [CONTACT_847715]. Dry eye can be 
related to external factors, such as the low humidity of air conditioned offices, winter 
heating, a dusty or windy outdoor environment, prolonged computer use, or wearing 
contact [CONTACT_13276], as well as to internal factors, such as hormonal imbalance, autoimmune 
disease, the presence of many widely prescribed systemic medications, anatomical changes 
or trauma, and aging. Symptoms result in mildly decreased quality of life at a mi nimum, 
and with increasing severity, loss of function and productivity, pain, light sensitivity, and 
the misery that accompanies significantly impaired vision and decreased quality of life. 
With the aging population in the [LOCATION_002] and other countries  of the developed world, 
and with increasing computer use, DED is expected to continue to become more prevalent 
and finding a treatment is becoming more important (Schaumberg DA, et al. 2009 ).  
STUDY TREATMENT  
Researchers at Pennsylvania State University/H ershey Medical Center have been 
exploring the role of the Opi[INVESTIGATOR_847700] (OGRS), which includes 
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_847701] (OGF), and its receptor, OGFr, in the health and healing of the 
corneal epi[INVESTIGATOR_847702] [ADDRESS_1178588] demonstrated the safety 
and efficacy of topi[INVESTIGATOR_847703]. This rese arch led to an investigational drug study 
entitled: “Topi[INVESTIGATOR_847704]: 
A Tolerability Study” (Liang et al., Volume 32 (2), 2016, pp 127 -132; DOI: 
10.1089/jop.2015.0070). It was concluded that top ical naltrexone was  well tolerated in 
healthy human subjects after 1 or 4 eye drops of naltrexone at dosages up to ~3.76 μg 
administered over a 24 -h treatment period and observed for 1 week.

This is a Phase 2, s ingle -center, double -masked, randomized, placebo -controlled study  to 
compare the safety a nd efficacy of Naltrexone Ophthalmic Solution , 0.002 % to placebo 
for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of dry eye in diabetic subjects. Subjects 
eligible to be randomized will receive one of the following treatments to be administered 
bilaterally BID  for 29  days (from Visit 2 to Visit 5): Naltrexone Ophthalmic Solution, 
0.002 % or Placebo Ophthalmic Solution (Vehicle). During a 10 -day study run -in period 
(for the purpose of subject selection) prior to randomization, all subjects will receive 
Placebo Op hthalmic Solution (Vehicle) bilaterally BID . Participants who terminate early 
during the application period will be asked to complete safety assessments (if the 
participants agree ) prior to study exit. Participants who are terminated early from the 
study w ill not be replaced. A chart illustrating the study’s structure is below.

7 STUDY MATERIALS  
7.1 Study Treatment(s)  
7.1.1 Study Treatment  
Naltrexone Ophthalmic solution will be formulated as a stable, sterile, topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], 
ophthalmic solution containing 21 μg/mL naltrexone hydrochloride in a multi -use 
container for topi[INVESTIGATOR_847708]. The study t reatment will be delivered as a 
drop in each eye BID:  
 Naltrexone Ophthalmic Solution, 0.002 % 
 Placebo Ophthalmic Solution  
 
7.1.2 Description of and Justification for the Route of Administration, Dosage, Dosage 
Regimen, and Treatment Period(s).  
Selection of Dose:  
Previous animal studies demonstrated that NTX dissolved in Vigamox® in the range of 
10-[ADDRESS_1178596] dosage of NTX was 5 x 10 -5 M dissolved in Vigamox® 
and applied four times  over a 24 -hour period equaling 3.77 µg of NTX.  The compound 
was prepared by [CONTACT_847717]’s Pharmacy, FL.  
These molar dosages of NTX were converted by [CONTACT_847718] a final formulation 
containing 20 µg/ml NTX, with each drop (0.028 ml) containing 0.56 µg NTX (a ssuming 
~35.7 drops per ml).  In the proposed clinical trial, drops will be applied twice daily 
yielding a total NTX dosage of 1.[ADDRESS_1178597] 
the clinical dosage shown to be safe for a 24 -hour period of time.  
Furth ermore, the 20 µg/ml NTX dosage used in the bridge studies was shown to be 
consistently more effective in comparison to the NTX (5x 10 -5 M) prepared in 
Vigamox®.  Moreover, the 20 µg/ml NTX dosage was applied 4 times daily for a period 
of 30 days in both r ats and rabbits and shown to be safe based on pathological assessment 
Naltrexone Ophthalmic Solution  Ocunova, Inc.   
Clinical Trial Protocol: DDES001/ 18-110-[ADDRESS_1178598] (Yale University).  The total amount of 
NTX applied to the rat or rabbit eye over a 30 day period was 120 µg.

At the conclusion of the trial, after all eligible/enrolled subjects ha ve had their last on -site 
visit, the CRA will conduct a Close -Out Visit (COV).   During the COV the CRA will:  
 Review all ICFs  
 Assess data integrity by [CONTACT_20683] a random sampling of 10% of total subjects 
enrolled and conduct a thorough review of source to v erify adequacy of data 
collection (GDP), subject eligibility and safety (GCP).    
 CRA will query any discrepant data.   If any findings constitute Major protocol 
deviations, the Lead and PM will be notified to determine if additional data 
review is warranted . 
 Reconcile and return IP  
 Review and reconcile site’s ISF to Ora’s TMF.  
Further details of the study monitoring will be outlined in a monitoring plan.  
Regulatory authorities of domestic and foreign agencies and Ora, Inc. Quality Assurance 
and/or its design ees may carry out on -site inspections and/or audits which may include 
source data checks. Therefore, direct access to the original source data will be required 
for inspections and/or audits. All inspections and audits will be carried out giving 
considerati on to data protection as well as subject confidentiality to the extent that local, 
state, and federal laws apply.

Clinical Trial Protocol: DDES001/ 18-110-[ADDRESS_1178610] medical occurrence associated with the use of an IP in 
humans, whether or not co nsidered IP -related. An AE can be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of an IP, without any judgment about causality. An AE can arise 
from any use of the IP (e.g ., off -label use, use in combination with another drug or 
medical device) and from any route of administration, formulation, or dose, including an 
overdose. An AE can arise from any delivery, implantation, or use of a medical device, 
including medical devi ce failure, subject characteristics that may impact medical device 
performance (e.g., anatomical limitations), and therapeutic parameters (e.g., energy 
applied, sizing, dose release, and anatomic fit) associated with medical device use.  
All AEs spontaneous ly reported by [CONTACT_3184]/or in response to an open question 
from study personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_4171], physical examination or other 
diagnostic procedures will be recorded in the source document and on the appropriate 
pages of the CRF. Any clin ically relevant deterioration in clinical finding is considered 
an AE and must be recorded. When possible, signs and symptoms indicating a common 
underlying pathology should be noted as one comprehensive event.  
Documentation regarding the AE should be made  as to the nature, date of onset, end date, 
severity, and relationship to IP, action(s) taken, seriousness, and outcome of any sign or 
symptom observed by [CONTACT_72078].  
9.1.1 Severity  
Severity of an AE is de fined as a qualitative assessment of the degree of intensity of an 
AE as determined by [CONTACT_72079]/her by [CONTACT_423]. The 
assessment of severity is made irrespective of relationship to IP or seriousness of the 
event and should be e valuated according to the following scale:  
 Mild : Event is noticeable to the subject, but is easily tolerated and does not 
interfere with the subject’s daily activities.  
 Moderate : Event is bothersome, possibly requiring additional therapy, and may 
interfere with the subject’s daily activities.  
 Severe : Event is intolerable, necessitates additional therapy or alteration of 
therapy, and interferes with the subject’s daily activities.  
9.1.[ADDRESS_1178611]  
The relationship of each AE to the IP should be determined by [CONTACT_80694]:  
 Suspected : A reasonable possibility exists that the IP caused the AE. A suspected 
AE can be further defined as:  
Naltrexone Ophthalmic Solution  Ocunova, Inc.   
Clinical Trial Protocol: DDES001/ 18-110-0002  21 June 2018  
 
 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 33 of 66  Definite : Relationship exists when the AE follows a reasonable sequence from 
the time of IP administration, follows a known response pattern of the drug 
class, is confirmed by [CONTACT_3895][INVESTIGATOR_590197].  
 Probable : Relationship exists when the AE follows a reasonable sequence 
from the time of IP administration, follows a known response pattern of the 
drug class, is confirmed by [CONTACT_3895][INVESTIGATOR_590198].  
 Possib le: Relationship exists when the AE follows a reasonable sequence 
from the time of IP administration, but could also have been produced by [CONTACT_1560]’s clinical state or by [CONTACT_339413].  
 Not Suspected: A reasonable possibility does not exist that the IP caused the AE.  
 Not Related:  Concurrent illness, concurrent medication, or other known cause 
is clearly responsible for the AE, the administration of the IP and the 
occurrence of the AE are not reasonably related in time, OR expos ure to IP 
has not occurred.  
Suspected adverse reaction means any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that 
the IP caused the AE. “Reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a 
causal relationship between the IP and the AE. Types of  evidence that would suggest a 
causal relationship between the IP and the AE event include: a single occurrence of an 
event that is uncommon and known to be strongly associated with IP exposure (e.g., 
angioedema, hepatic injury, Stevens -Johnson Syndrome); one or more occurrences of an 
event that is not commonly associated with IP exposure, but is otherwise uncommon in 
the population exposed to the IP (e.g., tendon rupture); an aggregate analysis of specific 
events observed in a clinical trial (such as known  consequences of the underlying disease 
or condition under investigation or other events that commonly occur in the study 
population independent of drug therapy) that indicates those events occur more 
frequently in the IP -treatment group than in a concurre nt or historical control group.  
9.1.3 Expectedness  
The expectedness of an AE should be determined based upon existing safety information 
about the IP using these explanations:  
 Unexpected: An AE that is not listed in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) or is not 
listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed.  
 Expected:  An AE that is listed in the IB at the specificity and severity that has been 
observed.  
 Not applicable: An AE unrelated to the IP.  
AE events that are mentioned in the IB as occurring with  a class of products or as 
anticipated from the pharmacological/mechanical (or other) properties of the product, but 
are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular product under 
investigation are to be considered unexpected.  
Naltrexone Ophthalmic Solution  Ocunova, Inc.   
Clinical Trial Protocol: DDES001/ 18-110-[ADDRESS_1178612] to the Medical Monitor’s determination.  
9.2 Serious Adverse Events  
An AE is considered serious if, in the view of the investigator , it results in any of the 
followi ng outcomes:  
 Death;  
 A life -threatening AE;  
Note: An AE is considered “life -threate ning” if, in the view of the investigator  its 
occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of death. It does not include an AE that, 
had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
 Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];  
Note: The term “inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” refers to any inpatient admission (even if less 
than 24 hours). For chronic or long -term inpatients, inpatient admission includes transfer 
within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4591]/intensive care inpatient unit. Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_847711]: emergency room visits; outpatient/same -day/ambulatory procedures; 
observation/short stay units; rehabilitation facilities; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4593]; nursing homes; or 
clinical research/phase 1 units.  
Note: The term “prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5186] n” refers to any extension of an 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_241526].  
 A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disru ption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions;  
Note: A serious adverse event (SAE) specifically related to visual threat would be 
interpreted as any potential impairment or damage to the subject’s eyes (e.g., 
hemorrhage, retinal detachment, central  corneal ulcer or damage to the optic nerve).  
 A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
Important medical events that may not result in death, are life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical 
judgment , they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
9.[ADDRESS_1178613] be reported to Ora and the IRB/IEC as requi red by [CONTACT_5040]/IEC, federal, state, or local regulations and governing health authorities and recorded 
on the appropriate CRF. AE’s will be collected from first dose of study drug to 30 days 
after treatment discontinuation.

9.4 Procedures for Unmasking (if applicable)  
All subjects, investigators, and study personnel involved with the conduct of the study 
will be masked with regard to treatment assignments. When medically necessary, the 
investigator may need to determine what treatment arm has been assigned to a subject. 
When possible (i.e., in non -emergent situations), Ora should be notified before 
unmasking study drug. Ora must be informed immediately about any unmasking event.  
If the  investigator identifies a medical need for unmasking the treatment  assignment of a 
subject, he  should contact [CONTACT_847721], if possible. Ora 
will ask the site to complete and send them the Unmasking Request Form. Ora will 
Naltrexone Ophthalmic Solution  Ocunova, Inc.   
Clinical Trial Protocol: DDES001/ 18-110-[ADDRESS_1178616]’s study file and 
provide a copy for the Trial Master File (TMF). For each  unmasked request, the reason, 
date, signature, and name [CONTACT_72088], must be noted in the 
subject’s study file. Unmasked subjects will be discontinued from the study.  
9.[ADDRESS_1178617]’s source docum ent. Non -serious 
AEs identified on the last scheduled cont act must be recorded on the AE CRF with the 
status noted.  
If the investigator becomes aware of any new information regarding an existing SAE 
(i.e., resolution, change in condition, or new treatment ), a new SAE/Unanticipated Report 
Form must be completed and faxed to Ora within 24 hours of the site’s awareness of the 
new information. The original SAE form is not to be altered. The report should describe 
whether the event has resolved or continues and  how the event was treated.  
10 STATISTICAL HYPOTHESES AND METHODS OF ANALYSES  
10.1 Analysis Populations  
Analysis Populations  
 Modified Intent -to-Treat Population  – The modified intent -to-treat ( mITT) 
population includes all randomized subjects with at least one post visit 2 study 
assessment. Efficacy analysis will be performed on the mITT population. 
Subjects in the mITT population will be analyzed as randomized.  
 
 Safety Population – The safety population includes all subjects who have 
received at least one dose o f the investigational product. Subjects in the Safety 
population will be analyzed as treated.

Visual Acuity Procedures (ETDRS Chart)  
LogMAR visual acuity (VA) must be assessed using an Early Treatment Diabetic 
Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) chart. The procedure used will be consistent with the 
recommendations provided for using the ETDRS eye chart. VA should be evaluated at 
the beginning of each visit in the study (i.e., prior to slit -lamp examination). VA testing 
should be done  with most recent correction.  
Equipment  
The VA chart to be used is the ETDRS chart. If smaller reproduction (18"  by 18", e.g., 
from Prevent Blindness) wall charts are used, the subject viewing distance should be 
exactly 10  feet (or as specified by [CONTACT_847725]). In ALL cases, for purposes of 
standardizing the testing conditions during the study, all sites must use only the 'R' charts, 
and the right eye should be tested first. For reflectance (wall) charts, the chart should be 
placed frontally and well -illuminated.  
Measurement Technique  
The chart should be at a comfortable viewing angle. The right eye should be tested first. 
The subject should attempt to read each letter, line -by-line, left to right, beginning with 
line [ADDRESS_1178633] identification of 
each letter. He/she is not to proceed to the next letter until he/she has given a definite 
response.  
If the subject changes a response (e.g., that was a "C" not an "O") before he has read 
aloud t he next letter, then the change must be accepted. If the subject changes a response 
having read the next letter, then the change is not to be accepted. The examiner should 
never point to the chart or to specific letters on the chart during the test.  
A maxi mum effort should be made to identify each letter on the chart. When the subject 
says he or she cannot read a letter, he or she should be encouraged to guess. If the subject 
identifies a letter as [ADDRESS_1178634] may be the only one read correctly. The number of letters missed or read 
incorrectly should be noted.   
Naltrexone Ophthalmic Solution  Ocunova, Inc.   
Clinical Trial Protocol: DDES001/ 18-110-[ADDRESS_1178635] line in which a letter is read correctly will be taken as the base logMAR r eading. 
To this value will be added the number "N x 0.02" where 'N' represents the total number 
of letters missed up to and included in the last line read. This total sum represents the 
logMAR VA for that eye.  
For example: Subject correctly reads 4 of 5 le tters on the 0.2  line, and 2 of 5 letters on the 
0.1 line.  
Base logMAR  = 0.1  
N (total number of letters incorrect on line 0.2 as 
well as 0.1)  = 4 
N x T (T=0.02)  = 0.08  
Base logMAR + (N x T)  = 0.1 + 0.08  
logMAR VA  = 0.[ADDRESS_1178636] be consistently done using the same lighting 
conditions and same correction if possible during the entire study. If the same correction 
cannot be used (i.e., a subject forgets his glasses), the reason for the change in correction 
should be documented.  
Note: A clinically significant visual acuity decrease (defined as an increase of 0.22 or 
greater in logM AR score) from b aseline (Visit 1 ) will be considered an Adverse Event.  
Slit Lamp Biomicroscopy Procedures  
Slit lamp biomicroscopic observations will be graded as Normal or Abnormal. Abnormal 
findings will be categorized as clinically significant (findings that may interfere with 
study parameters or otherwise confound the data as determined by [CONTACT_093])  or not 
clinically significant (NCS). The following will be examined:  
 Cornea  
 Conjunctiva  
 Anterior Chamber  
 Iris 
 Lens

Dilated Fundoscopy  
Dilated fundus exams will be performed using indirect ophthalmoscopy. The investigator 
will make observations of the vitreous, retina, macula, choroid and optic nerve.   
Observations will be grade d as Normal or Abnormal. Abnormal findings that are 
clinically significant (as determined by [CONTACT_847726]) and those that are not clinically significant 
will be described. An indir ect Fundoscopy examination should be performed if retinal 
disease is detected. A 78 or 90 diopter lens should also be used as needed.  
 Vitreous:  Examination should emphasize the visual axis.  
 Retina, Macula, Choroid:  Include an observation of the retina and its blood 
vessels. Eyes should be excluded from the study if active inflammation is present.  
 Optic Nerve:  Significant damage or cuppi[INVESTIGATOR_597733].  
 
It is recommended that tropi[INVESTIGATOR_31424] 1% ophthalmic solution be used to dilate subjects. 
The use of cyclopentolate 1% ophthalmic solution is recommended as secondary dilating 
medication, should the need arise.   
Intraocular Pressure  
Intraocular pressure (IOP)  will be measured in each eye by [CONTACT_597752].   A single measurement is made to 
obtain a determination of IOP.   The same tonometer employing the investigator’s 
standard technique will be used th roughout the study.   In addition, all reasonable efforts 
will be made to have the same examiner obtain all IOP measurements for a given subject.

the readings will be incorrect and the filament should not be used).  
3. The examiner will inform the subject that a thin delicate plastic filament will be used 
to test their cornea l sensitivity and that they will feel the sensation similar to a strand 
of hair on their eye. (If the subject is hesitant, a spot on the subject’s hand will be 
cleaned with an alcohol pad and the filament touched to the hand to demonstrate the 
painless con tact).  
4. The examiner will instruct the subject to say “Yes” when they feel sensation on their 
eyeball.  
5. The examiner will place their free hand on the cheek below the eye being measured to 
stabilize subject’s head position.  
6. The examiner will position their hand with the device such that the filament is normal 
(90 degree angle with corneal surface). The device should be between the examiner’s 
index, middle finger, and thumb.  
7. The examiner will extend fingers such that the filament applies gentle pressure on th e 
central corneal surface. The examiner will then ask subject if they can perceive the 
filament touching the central corneal surface.  
If the subject responds “Yes”, the examiner will ensure the response is valid by 
[CONTACT_746] a sham (not touching the corne a) application and also confirm that 
response was not due to eyelids touching the filament.  
If the subject responds “No”, then the filament is shortened the length by 5mm and 
reapplied to the cornea.  
If the subject responds “Yes”, record length; if the su bject responds “No”, go to  
step b.  
Step 7 is repeated 3 times.  
The filament is retracted such that only 10 mm are exposed.  
The tip is wiped with an alcohol pad gently ENSURING that it does NOT bend the 
filament.  
The alcohol is allowed to dry before reusing device (alcohol can cause corneal abrasions).

Name [CONTACT_790]/Company: Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
Name [CONTACT_791]: CAEL -101  
Name [CONTACT_3261]: CAEL -101 is chimeric fibril -reactive monoclonal antibody 11- 1F4 
Title of Study: A Phase 2, Open-Label, Multicenter Dose Selection Study to Evaluate the Safety and 
Tolerability of CAEL-101 in Patients with AL Amyloidosis 
Study center(s): Approximately 3 US investigational centers will participate  
Number of patients: Approximately 25  Phase of development: 2  
Objectives:  
The primary objective is:  
• To define the safety and tolerability of CAEL-101 and determine the recommended Phase 3 
dose (RP3D) for patients with amyloid light- chain  (AL) amyloidosis  
Secondary objectives in this study are: 
• To define the safety and tolerability of CAEL-[ADDRESS_351580] of care (SoC) cyclophosphamide, bortezomib, dexamethasone (CyBorD)  
• To define the safety tolerability of CAEL -[ADDRESS_351581] and daratumumab 
• To describe the pharmacokinetic (PK) prof ile of CAEL -101 and to explore the PK profile of 
CAEL -101 when given bi-weekly (q2wk) versus once- monthly  (q4wk) after the first 50 weeks. 
The exploratory objective is: 
• To assess the efficacy of CAEL -[ADDRESS_351582] chemotherapy and daratumumab.  
The study is divided into two parts:  
- Part A defines the safety and tolerability of CAEL -[ADDRESS_351583] and 
daratumumab  
Part  A 
Part A consists of a Screening period, a safety and tolerability Treatment period and an End of 
Treatment period. The Treatment period of Part A, the part where the RP3D is determined, is divided 
into a Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) Observation period and a Continued Treatment period. During the DLT Observation period, patients will be seen in the clinic every week (q1wk) for [ADDRESS_351584] CAEL-101 dose to be studied in Part A, 500 mg/m
2, was determined based on the completed 
study CAEL101-101.

Alexion Pharmaceuticals , Inc.               18 July 2022 
Page 18 of 73  The initial cohort dose assignments in Part A will be: Cohort 1 500 mg/m2, Cohort 2 750  mg/m2 and 
Cohort 3 1000 mg/m2. 
DLT Observation period to determine the RP3D  
Part A of the study will employ a 3+[ADDRESS_351585] 3 patients will be enrolled in 
each dose cohort unless adverse events (AEs) preventing further dosing are observed. Enrollment into 
a new cohort with a higher dose of CAEL- [ADDRESS_351586] patient enrolled in the previous cohort.  
If 0 out of 3 patients experience a DLT during the DLT observation period, the next dose cohort will be opened. If 1 out of 3 patients experience a DLT during the DLT observation period, the cohort may 
be expanded to 6 patients. If no further patients in the expanded cohort experience a DLT during the 
DLT observation period (i.e., 1 out of 6 patients experiences a DLT), increase to the next dose may 
take place. If 2 or more patients in a cohort experience a DLT during the DLT observation period, 
further dose increase will cease. New patients will be enrolled at the lower (tolerated) dose level if only 3 patients were previously enrolled in that cohort. The recommended dose will require at leas t 6 
patients treated with CAEL -101 at that dose and ≤ 1 patient having experienced a DLT during the DLT 
observation period. Based on clinical safety and laboratory data, the safety review team (Sponsor and 1 
or more Investigators) may direct that an interm ediate dose between the dose demonstrating the DLT 
and the previously documented safe dose may be explored, or a different dosing regimen starting at a lower dose be explored. Dose increases may be discontinued based on safety or PK findings that may influ ence the decision about a recommended dose.  
The Sponsor and at least one Investigator will jointly decide the following: 
• Dose increases in the next cohort and/or dose schedule  
• Recommended Phase 3 dose  
• Dose reductions based on severity, duration and frequency of toxicities observed at the 
previous dose level  
The Sponsor may choose to evaluate CAEL-101 in additional patients and at other/higher doses and 
dosing schedules to further assess the PK profile, the benefit/risk profile and/or based on the saf ety 
findings from ongoing CAEL- [ADDRESS_351587] completed the Safety Observation period, patients from Part A who are in the Continued Treatment Period and who, in the Investigator’s 
judgment, should have their SoC treatment complemented with daratumumab may do so. 
Continued Treatment Period  
Patients from both Parts A and B will continue receiving CAEL- 101 therapy and SoC. CAEL -101 
study drug infusions will continue, with dosing approximately every two weeks (q2wk). After 
completing approximately 50 weeks of treatment, participants may switch to an alternative 
maintenance dosing regimen of every four weeks (q4wk), and then start following the assessment

(q2wk) to once every 4 weeks (q4wk) should be agreed between the Investigator and the Sponsor 
Medical Monitor and based on the assessment of the combined hematological an d organ responses as 
per the scoring system proposed by [CONTACT_288544].  (Sidana, 2020 ). Switching could be considered if the 
score is within the range of 0 to 3. Approximately every month or every visit as noted in the Schedule of Assessments, patients will be assessed for changes in free ligh t chains (FLC), [ADDRESS_351588] dose of study drug, all patients will be assessed for safety and changes in B -type natriuretic peptide and N- terminal pro b -type 
natriuretic pept ide (NT -proBNP). Patients with cardiac AL amyloidosis will be assessed for changes in 
cardiac troponin T (cTnT)/cardiac troponin I (cTnI). 
Patients will be treated until death, unacceptable toxicity, symptomatic deterioration, Investigator 
decision, patient decision or Sponsor decision to terminate the study. 
End of Treatment Period  
Patients from both Part A and Part B who discontinue from the study should have the End of 
Treatment assessments completed as indicated in the Schedule of Assessments.

Statistical methods:  
Safety  
Safety assessments will include AEs, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, physical examinations and 
electrocardiograms (ECGs). The incidence of DLTs will be evaluated for each dose escalation cohort. 
All treatment- emergent adverse events (TEAEs) will be summarized by [CONTACT_288549]. All TEAEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_12035], severity and 
potential causality to study drug.  
Clinical laboratory tests and vital signs will be summarized descriptively for each dose cohort. All 
abnormal findings in clinical laboratory test results, vital signs, physical examinations and ECGs will 
be listed.  
Pharma cokinetics  
PK parameters will be tabulated and summarized with descriptive statistics by [CONTACT_74299]/or study part. 
Patients in Part A who discontinue for non- safety reasons may be replaced.  
Efficacy  
Efficacy endpoints, including NT-proBNP, cTnT/cTnI, proteinuria, will be assessed for absolute 
changes (and percent changes) over time. Patients with organ involvement (eg, cardiac, renal) will be 
identified at baseline through minimum thresholds for each relevant biomarker and defined as being 
Cardiac Evaluable, Renal Evaluable, etc, accordingly. These specific analysis populations will then be 
assessed for changes over time in the organ -specific biomarkers. Patients may be classified as 
responders (by [CONTACT_90628]) according to varying definitions of response, eg, for NT- proBNP, a decrease of 
30% may be defined as one type of cardiac responder. As this analysis is exploratory, various 
definitions may be used to allow for a thorough understanding of the treatment benefit over time.

of treatment, participants may switch to an alternative maintenance dosing regimen of every four weeks (q4wk) and then start following the assessment pat tern of V29 -V25-V27 -V29 -V25 and so on. The option of treatment switching 
from bi -weekly (q2wk) to once every 4 weeks (q4wk) should be agreed between the Investigator and the Sponsor Medical Monitor and based on the assessment of the combined hematological and organ responses as per the scoring 
system proposed by [CONTACT_288544]. (Sidana, 2020) , switching could be considered if the score is within the r ange of 0 to 3 ( Figure  4). 
b. The Investigator or a licensed team member, per local regulations, will perform physical examinations . 
c. For women of childbearing potential only, serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) required at screening. Subsequent pregnancy tests may be performed using urine dipstick.  A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the 
postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a post -menopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy. However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is 
insufficient

Page 26 of 73  2. INTRODUCTION 
2.1. Background  
Amyloidosis is a rare and serious heterogeneous group of diseases characterized by [CONTACT_288550] a single organ or systematically in many organs 
(Hemminki, 2012). Amyloid light- chain (AL) amyloidosis is the most common form of systemic 
amyloid disease, accounting for approximately 70% of all subjects suffering from the disease 
(Milani, 2018). All organs, except for the brain, can be affected in AL amyloidosis leading to 
irreversible organ dysfunction and death if unrecognized or treated ineffectively ( Milani, 2018). 
The disease is inevitably progressive and accumulating amyloid protein deposits interfere with the tissue or organ’s healthy function causing clinical symptoms, organ failure and death. Thirty 
to 40% of patients die within 12 months of diagnosis ( Dispenzieri, 2015a ). The prognosis is very 
poor, with less than 5% of all subjects with AL amyloidosis surviving more than 10 years after diagnosis ( Kyle, 1986; Palladini, 2017; Palladini, 2015). The prognosis of patient s with AL 
amyloidosis depends on the burden of the amyloid in the tissues, especially the heart, and the size of the plasma cell clone and its biology, which predict the ability to achieve a hematologic response. 
Treatment of AL amyloidosis is largely base d on chemotherapy and/or autologous stem cell 
transplants and are targeted to eradicate the pathologic plasma cells and stop the production of 
new amyloid and the resulting fibrils. There are no approved treatments for organ-deposits of AL 
amyloidosis, and the only available options for patients is to be treated with experimental 
treatments, most often in clinical trials  (Dispenzieri, 2015a ; Palladini, 2018) . Subjects suffering 
from AL amyloidosis are at high risk of death and are extremely susceptible to treatment toxicity 
in the first few months after diagnosis. Whereas, if they survive this initial treatment, they enjoy 
a better long -term outc ome ( Dispenzieri, 2013). There is a high unmet need for a therapeutic 
treatment that removes existing amyloid deposits to limit and reverse organ dysfunction. 
2.2. CAEL -101 
CAEL -101 (Ch11- 1F4, NSC -711516), is a chimeric immunoglobulin G1 kappa isotype version 
of m11-1F4, the parent murine monoclonal antibody of CAEL-101, which binds to a cryptic 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_288533] N -terminal of both κ and λ light chain proteins that adopt a non-native structure. 
CAEL -[ADDRESS_351595] in human experience with CAEL-101 was study protocol CAEL101-101, in which 
doses from 0.5 mg/m2 up to 500 mg/m2 were tested for safety and tolerabil ity in both single-dose 
and multi-dose regimens. No dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were observed in that dose range, 
including up to the maximum dose of 500 mg/m2. 
The primary objective of this study was to describe the safety and tolerability of CAEL -101 in 
combination with cyclophosphamide-bortezomib-dexamethasone (CyBorD) and to determine the recommended Phase 3 dose during an initial 14-day (Cohort 1) or 27-day (Cohorts 2 and 3) 
treatment and follow -up period (referred to as the Dose- Limiting T oxicity, ie, DLT, Observation 
period).

Alexion Pharmaceuticals , Inc.               18 July 2022 
Page 27 of 73  This assessment has been completed, with all three tested dose levels of CAEL -101 
(500, 750, and 1000 mg/m2), when administered with concurrent CyBorD, found to be safe and 
well-tolerated by [CONTACT_288551]. No dose- limiting toxicities were observed in any patients 
at any of these dose levels during the DLT Observation period. Based on these safety and 
tolerability data, and protocol guidance, the final cohort review by [CONTACT_17149] [INVESTIGATOR_288534] 1000 mg/m2 dose is 
recommended for the Phase 3 studies. 
The pharmacokinetic (PK) review of the three CAEL-[ADDRESS_351596] exposure levels (C trough) (with a minimum of 90% 
receptor site occupancy desired). To supp ort the broadest range of patients and to account for 
patient exposure variability, the 1000 mg/m2 dose fulfills these requirements and achieves the 
desired C trough levels after the second dose.  
Therefore, based on safety, tolerability outcomes and pharmacokinetics, the 1000 mg/m2 dose 
was selected for use in the Phase 3 studies, CAEL101-301 and CAEL101-302, as well as in 
Part B of this study.  
Refer to the CAEL -101 Investigator’s Brochure for detailed preclinical and clinical study data.

3.1. Primary Objective  
The primary objective in this study is to define the safety and tolerability of CAEL-101 and 
determine the recommended Phase 3 dose (RP3D) for patients with AL amyloidosis. 
3.2. Secondary Objectives  
The secondary objectives in this study are to:  
• define the safety and tolerability of CAEL-[ADDRESS_351597] of care (SoC) CyBorD  
• define the safety and tolerability of CAEL-[ADDRESS_351598] and daratumumab 
• describe the PK prof ile of CAEL -101 and to explore the PK profile of CAEL-101 when 
given bi-weekly (q2wk) versus  once-monthly (q4wk) after the first [ADDRESS_351599] chemotherapy and daratumumab. 
The study is divided into two parts: 
− Part A defines the safety and tolerability of CAEL-[ADDRESS_351600] and determines the RP3D  
− Part B evaluates the safety and tolerability of CAEL-[ADDRESS_351601] and daratumumab 
Part A  
Part A consists of a Screening period, a safety and tolerability Treatment period and an End of Treatment period. The Treatment period of Part A, the part where the RP3D is determined, is 
divided into a DLT Observation period and a Continued Treatment period. During the DLT 
Observation period, patients will be seen in the clinic every week (q1wk) for 4 weeks to receive study drug infusions and be assessed for DLTs. 
Part A of the study will employ a 3+[ADDRESS_351602] 3 patients will be enrolled 
in each dose cohort unless adverse events (AEs) preventing further dosing are observed. 
Enrollment into a new cohort with a higher dose of CAEL-[ADDRESS_351603] 6 patients treated with CAEL -101 at that dose and 
≤ [ADDRESS_351604] and daratumumab.

Page 30 of 73  Continued Treatment Period  
Patients from both Parts A and B will continue receiving CAEL-101 therapy and SoC. 
CAEL -101 study drug infusions will continue, with dosing approximately every two weeks 
(q2wk). 
After completing approximately 50 weeks of treatment, participants may switch to an alternative 
maintenance dosing regimen of every four weeks (q4wk), and then start following the assessment pattern of V29 -V25-V27-V29-V25 and so on. The option of treatment switching 
from bi -weekly (q2wk) to once every 4 weeks (q4wk) should be agreed between the Investigator 
and the Sponsor Medical Monitor and based on the assessment of the combined hematological and organ responses as per the scoring system proposed by [CONTACT_288552]. ( Sidana, 2020)
. 
Switching could be considered if the score is within the range of 0 to 3 ( Figure  4).

Page 36 of 73  6. TREATMENT PLAN  
The study is divided into two parts:  
− Part A evaluates the safety and tolerability of CAEL -[ADDRESS_351617] and determines the RP3D 
− Part B evaluates the safety and tolerability of CAEL -[ADDRESS_351618] completed the Safety 
Observation period, patients from Part A who are in the Continued Treatment Period and who, in the Investigator’s judgment, should have their SoC treatment complemented with daratumumab may do so. 
During the Continued Treatment period for Part A and Part B, patients will receive study drug 
infusions approximately q2wk. Approximately every month or every visit as noted in the Schedule of Assessments, patients will be assessed for changes in FLC, 24-hour urine protein, 
PK and immunogenicity tests. Approximately every [ADDRESS_351619] dose of study drug, all 
patients will be assessed for safety and changes in B -type natriuretic peptide and N- terminal pro 
b-type natriuretic peptide (NT -proBNP). Patients with cardi ac AL amyloidosis will be assessed 
for changes in cardiac troponin T (cTnT)/cardiac troponin I (cTnI). 
Every effort should be made to schedule visits within the protocol-specified windows. Refer to 
the Schedule of Assessments in Table [ADDRESS_351620] and timing of assessments.  
6.1. Screening Period  
The Screening Period is the same for Part A and for new patients enrolling in Part B. Patients 
will provide written  informed consent to participate in this study before completing any 
protocol-specified procedures or evaluations not considered to be part of the patient’s SoC. 
Patients will be eligible to enter the Screening period if they have a clinical diagnosis of S tage I, 
II or IIIa AL amyloidosis consistent with the 2013 modifications to the 2004 Mayo staging criteria ( Table 2) at the time of Screening. One Stage I  patient will be permitted to enroll per 
cohort in Part A and a maximum of two Stage I patients will be permitted to enroll in Part B.

(hs-cTnT), or generation 5 assay, is becoming more widely available and is used more commonly in clinical 
practice. It is established that a cTnT value of > 0.035 ng/mL can be extrapolated to a hs -cTnT value of 
≥ 50 pg/mL (0.05 ng/mL) for the determination of Mayo stage ( Muchtar, 2019) .

After signing the informed consent form (ICF), patients will be evaluated for entry criteria 
during the Screening period (within 21 days before administration of the study drug). Screening assessments with abnormal results may be repeated at the discretion of the Investigator. 
6.2. Treatment Period  
Patients in both Part A and Part B of the study, who meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of 
the exclusion criteria will be treated with CAEL -[ADDRESS_351622] chemotherapy (and 
daratumumab in Part B) until death, unacceptable toxicity, symptomatic deterioration, 
Investigator decision (see Section  6.2.[ADDRESS_351623] regimen), patient 
decision or Sponsor decision to terminate the s tudy. All patients in Parts A and B will receive 
CAEL -101 q1wk (+/-1d) for the first 4 infusions. During the Continued Treatment period, 
patients will receive CAEL -101 q2wk (+/-2d). After completing approximately 50 weeks of 
treatment, participants may switch to an alternative maintenance dosing regimen of every four weeks (q4wk), and then start following the assessment pattern of V29- V25-V27-V29-V25 and so 
on. The option of t reatment switching should be agreed between the Investigator and the Sponsor 
Medical Monitor and based on the assessment of the combined hematological and organ responses as per the scoring system proposed by [CONTACT_288544]. ( Sidana, 2020 ) Switching could be 
considered if the score is within the range of 0 to 3 ( Figure 4 ).

Page 38 of 73  6.2.1. Administration of Study Drug  
In Part A, each patient’s CAEL-101 dose will be determined by [CONTACT_288558]101-203 Dose 
Assignment scheme (see Table 3) and the patient’s body surface area in meters squared. 
In Part B, patients will receive the RP3D. When administered on the same day, CAEL-[ADDRESS_351624] chemotherapy or da ratumumab. Patients will receive 
CAEL -101 by [CONTACT_288559] 2 hours q1wk (+/-1d) for 4 infusions then 
q2wk (+/ -2d) thereafter. Patients will be observed in the clinic for [ADDRESS_351625] 4 infusions for infusion reactions, injection site reactions and overall well-being of the patient 
(may include vital signs at the Investigator’s discretion). 
Every effort should be made to assure the patient receives CAEL -101 according to the Schedule 
of Assessments (see Table 1). All doses of study drug should be administered on schedule based 
on the first dose received. For example, if dose 2 (V3) is administered on study day 8, dose 3 
(V4) should still be administered on study day 14 (+/-1d). If the patient misses a dose entirely, 
the Investigator must contact [CONTACT_137984] r before resuming dosing. All patients will 
remain on the dose level assigned to the cohort in which they were originally enrolled ( Table 3 ) 
until the RP3 D is identified. When the RP3D is identified, all patients will be changed to the 
RP3D.  
Additional details for study drug administration are included in the Pharmacy Manual. 
6.2.2. Concurrent Chemotherapy  
In addition to CAEL- 101, all patients in Part A will receive concurrent chemotherapy with 
CyBorD according to institutional SoC. Patients may initiate their chemotherapy regimen within 
[ADDRESS_351626] in the Investigator’s judgement, the Investigator may change the CyBorD regimen or stop it. 
New patients enrolled in Part B will receive concurrent chemotherapy with CyBorD plus 
daratumumab according to institutional SoC along with CAEL- 101. Patients may initiate their 
concurrent regimen within [ADDRESS_351627] or daratumumab in the Investigator’s judgment, the Investigator may change the regimen or stop it.  
Once the newly enrolled patients in Part B complete the Safety Observation period, 
daratumumab may be added to the SoC treatment r egimen for patients in Part A at the 
Protocol Amendment 3.0 CAEL101 -203 Phase 2         CAEL -101 
Alexion Pharmaceuticals , Inc.               18 July 2022 
Page 39 of 73  Investigator’s discretion. At the start of daratumumab treatment, patients will have additional 
complete blood count (CBC) with differential tests performed for at least 8 weeks to assess any 
changes in blood cell counts.  
Patients in Part A and Part B may be considered for other plasma cell dyscrasia (PCD) -directed 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_288536]. 
6.2.3. Recommended Phase 3 Dose Selection  
Part A of the study will employ a 3+[ADDRESS_351628] CAEL -101 dose to be studied 500 mg/m2 was determined based on the completed study 
CAEL101 -101.  
The Sponsor and at least one Investigator will jointly decide the following:  
• Dose increases in the next cohort and/or dose schedule 
• Recommended Phase 3 dose  
• Dose reductions based on severity, duration and frequency of toxicities observed at the 
previous dose level

dose level if only 3 patients were treated previously at that dose. 
≤ [ADDRESS_351630] dose level given  This is the RP3D.  
Abbreviations: DLT = dose limiting toxicity; RP3D = recommended Phase 3 dose  
The 500 mg/m2 dose was studied in the CAEL101-[ADDRESS_351631] patient enrolled in the previous cohort. 
Definition and instructions for assessment of DLT is presented in Section  6.2.4. If 0 out of 
3 patients experience a DLT during the DLT observation period, the next dose cohort will be 
opened. If 1 out of 3 patients experience a DLT during the DLT observation period, the cohort 
may be expanded to 6 patients. If no further patients in the expanded cohort experience a DLT 
during the DLT observation period (i.e., 1 out of 6 patients experiences a DLT) , increase to the 
next dose may take place. If 2 or more patients in a cohort experience a DLT during the DLT observation period, further dose increase will cease. New patients will be enrolled at the lower (tolerated) dose level if only [ADDRESS_351632] 6 patients treated with CAEL -101 at that dose and ≤ 1 
patient having experienced a DLT during the DLT observation period. Based on clinical safety 
and laboratory data, the safety review team (Sponsor and [ADDRESS_351633] that 
an intermediate dose between the dose demonstrating the DLT and the previously documented 
safe dose may be explored, or a different dosing regimen starting at a lower dose be explored. Dose i ncreases may be discontinued based on safety or PK findings that may influence the 
decision about a recommended dose.  
The Sponsor may choose to evaluate CAEL-101 in additional patients and at other/higher doses 
and dosing schedules to further assess the PK profile, the benefit/risk profile and/or based on the safety findings from ongoing CAEL- 101 clinical trials.  
6.2.4. Dose Limiting Toxicity  
For Part A of this study, a DLT is defined as any Grade 3 or greater study drug- related AE that is 
clinically significant.   
DLTs will be assessed during the DLT observation period for each cohort in Part A (See Section  6.2.3). DLTs that occur after the DLT observation period will not be used to determine 
dose increases or the RP3D dose but will be collected and evaluated by [CONTACT_288560]. 
6.2.5. Dose Delay  
Dose delay or modification for safety concerns are permitted based on the Inve stigator’s 
discretion. When not related to safety, decisions regarding dose delay and dose 
reductions/modifications will be made by [CONTACT_288561]. Patients will rec eive study drug every 7 
(+/-1) days for 4 infusions then every 14 (+/-2) days. Doses may be delayed due to patient care 
requirements (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], side effects). 
The study drug infusion may be delayed, or the dose reduced for infusion reactions. If the study 
drug infusion is delayed and in the absence of chemotherapy- related toxicities that would 
warrant PCD treatment delay, the patient may continue to receive their concurrent PCD treatment.

Alexion Pharmaceuticals , Inc.               18 July 2022 
Page 41 of 73  Guidelines for study drug dose reduction or delay: 
• Grad e 1 or 2 reactions: No requirement for dose delay or dose reduction. If the reaction 
persists at Grade 2 following completion of 4 doses of CAEL-101, a dose delay or dose 
reduction may be implemented at the discretion of the Investigator.  
• Grade 3 reaction s: Study drug may be withheld if an infusion reaction cannot be managed 
by [CONTACT_288562]. Study drug dosing may resume at the same dose and infusion rate or at the lower dose level (750 mg/m
2) when an infusion reaction resolves to 
Grade 1 o r symptoms return to baseline, except for instances where the potential 
recurrence of the even poses an undue risk for the patient (e.g., Grade 3 reaction that is deemed to be related to the study drug in the Investigator’s judgement). 
• Grade 4 reactions: S tudy drug should be stopped, and the study treatment withheld. Study 
drug should be permanently discontinued after the occurrence of a Grade 4 infusion reaction.  
If a dosing event is delayed by > [ADDRESS_351634] after a safety assessment. The local lab testing is acceptable to confirm the patient’s 
eligibility to continue receiving the study drug. The safety assessments are determined by [CONTACT_67441], however, the following are recommended: vi tal signs, medical history, 
physical exam, ECG, safety laboratory tests (detailed in Table 1, footnote d), pregnancy 
screen (if applicable), and SAE - and AE-specific follow up (if applicable and there are any 
safety concerns due to residual disease).  
6.3. End of Treatment  
Patients may choo se to discontinue the trial at any time, for any reason, and without prejudice to 
further treatment. (See Section  5.3) Patients who permanently discontinue CAEL -101 treatment 
should complete the EOT visits according to the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1) within 
[ADDRESS_351635] dose of CAEL -101. 
6.4. End of Study  
End of study is defined as when the Sponsor decides to terminate the study. 
6.5. Prior and Concomitant Medications  
All prior medications for AL amyloidosis that the patient has ever taken will be recorded. All 
medications (prescription and over the counter), vitamin and/or mineral supplements, and/or herbs the patient is taking at screening will also be recorded. Start and stop date, dose and route of administration, dosing frequency and indication will be documented. 
6.6. Permitted Medications  
Patients may take topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], ocular, intra- articular, intranasal, and inhalational corticosteroids with 
minimal systemic absorption. A brief course of less than 3 weeks of corticosteroids for 
prophylaxis (e.g., contrast dye allergy) or for treatment of non- immune conditions is permitted 
with consultations with the medical monitor. Patients may take up to 10 mg of corticosteroids for 
other conditions.

Page 42 of 73  Concomitant palliative and supportive care, including diuretics, for disease related symptoms is 
allowed. 
6.7. Prohibited Medications  
• Immunosuppressive agents 
• Immunosuppressive doses of systemic corticosteroids (except as noted in Section 6.6) 
• Any chemotherapy other than CyBorD during the DLT observation period (Part A) 
Please consult the Medical Monitor for any questions regarding immunosuppressive agents or live vaccine.  
6.8. Pharmacokinetic Measurements  
Blood samples for PK analyses of CAEL-101 will be collected according to the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1). Post-dose samples should only be obtained from an extremity opposite 
the administration site, unless approved by [CONTACT_1034].  
6.9. Immunogenicity Measurements 
Samples for immunogenicity tests for CAEL -101 will be collected according to the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table 1). Samples will be analyzed by [CONTACT_288563]-drug antibodies (ADAs) for all patients at all time points. Based on the presence of 
antibodies, additional characterization will be done (confirming positivity, dissecting specificity, 
neutralizing assays, and assays for assessing cell mediated immune responses) and assessment of correlation to clinical responses.  
6.9.1. ADA Variables  
ADA variables include ADA response category incidence and titer over the duration of the study 
as follows.  ADA response category definitions and titer thresholds will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan ( SAP). 
ADA response categories  
• ADA Negative  
• ADA Positive  
Patients who are ADA positive will be categorized as follow s: 
• Pre-existing Immunoreactivity  
• Treatment -emergent ADA Responses  
Patients with a treatment- emergent ADA response will be further categorized as 
follows: 
o Persistent Treatment -emergent Responses  
o Indeterminate Treatment -emergent Responses  
o Transient Treatment -emergent Reponses

6.10. Contraception Requirements  
A woman is considered a WOCBP following menarche and until becoming post-menopausal 
unless permanently sterile. Permanent sterilization methods include hysterectomy, bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_15559]. A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 
12 months without an alternative medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level 
in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a post-menopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy. However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient. 
A man is considered fertile after puberty unless permanently sterile by [CONTACT_31657]. 
Female patients of childbearing potential are eligible to participate in this trial ( Section  5.1) if 
they agree to use a highly effective method of contraception consistently and correctly from 
Screening until at least [ADDRESS_351636] dose of her PCD therapy, whichever is longer. 
Birth control methods which may be considered as highly effective can achieve a failure rate of 
less than 1% a year w hen used consistently and correctly and include: 
• Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing): oral, intravaginal or transdermal hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation 
• Progestogen-only oral, injectable or implantable hormonal cont raception associated 
with inhibition of ovulation 
• Intrauterine device  
• Intrauterine hormone- releasing system  
• Bilateral tubal occlusion  
• Vasectomized partner: a vasectomized partner is a highly effective birth control method provided that the partner is the s ole sexual partner of the WOCBP patient and 
that the vasectomized partner has received medical assessment of the surgical success.  
• Sexual abstinence: sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatments. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient.

condoms during heterosexual intercourse with WOCBP from Scr eening until at least [ADDRESS_351637] dose of his PCD 
therapy, whichever is longer.  
Non-pregnant WOCBP partners of fertile male patients should also use highly effective methods 
of contraception during the male patient’s treatment and until at least [ADDRESS_351638] dose of the male patient’s PCD therapy, whichever is longer.  
Patients should be permitted to seek advice about donation and cryopreservation of germ cells 
prior to starting treatment with study drug or PCD therapy, if possible and as their need to start treatment allows.  
Refer to the package insert or Summary of Product Characteristics ( SmPC ) for PCD medications 
for additional guidance on contraceptive use requirements. 
6.11. Assigning Patient Numbers  
Each patient will be assigned a unique patient number after signing the ICF. The patient number will be used on all of the patient’s study information. Patient numbers will not be reassigned. The first 4 digits will be the site number (XXXX) followed by a 4 -digit patient ID (YYYY) that 
together will be the patient numbe r (XXXX -YYYY). The second set of 4 digits (YYYY) will be 
sequential within sites, starting with 0001. 
Protocol Amendment 3.[ADDRESS_351639], CAEL-101, is formulated as a sterile, liquid solution of protein plus 
excipi[INVESTIGATOR_288537] a single-use, stoppered, glass vial. Each 10 mL vial contains 300 mg of chimeric fibril-reactive monoclonal antibody 11-1F4 at a concentration of 30 mg/mL. CAEL-101 will be diluted with commercially available 0.9% Normal Saline.  
7.2. Study Drug Packaging and Labeling  
CAEL -[ADDRESS_351640] should be refrigerated at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F).

Page 46 of 73  8. ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY 
Efficacy will be assessed through the evaluation of cardiac, renal, hepatic, and hematologic 
response (see Appendix B  and Appendix C ). 
Organ -specific outcomes for renal, hepatic, and cardiac biomarker response will be assessed 
using both retrospective and prospective data. The retrospective collection may include a review 
of the patient record at the site. Further, prospective collection has been added to collect future 
organ response outcomes. The combination of retrospective and prospective data collection will allow for a more robust determination of the effects of CAEL-101 on efficacy in patients with AL amyloidosis. 
8.1. Echocardiography  
Cardiac structure and function will be assessed through echocardiograms according to the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1). Echocardiograms obtained after screening may be within a 
+/- 30 day window from the study day. Echocardiograms should not be skipped. If the patient 
cannot undergo an echocardiogram within the assessment window (e.g., the patient is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]), it should be completed as soon as possible. 
8.2. NT-proBNP, cTnT/cTnI, dFLC  
Blood samples for NT-proBNP, cTnT/cTnI, and FLC will be collected according to the Schedule 
of assessments ( Table 1). Investigators may continue to collect samples for NT -proBNP, 
cTnT/cTnI, and FLC for local analysis and patient care per the local SoC. Such analyses will not 
be considered part of the study and will not be recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF).  
8.3. 24-hour Urine Protein  
Urine for protein will be collected from all patients over 24 hours according to the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1).  
Protocol Amendment 3.[ADDRESS_351642] 5 minutes. 
9.1.3. Physical Examination 
The Investigator or a licensed team member, per local regulations, will perform physical 
examinations according to the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1).  
9.1.4. Twelve- Lead Electrocardiogram  
Electrocardiograms will be performed on a calibrated Twelve -lead machine according to the 
Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1). Patients must be resting quietly in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_42428] 5  minutes before the Twelve -lead ECG.  
9.1.5. Clinical Laboratory Tests 
Clinical laboratory tests will be performed according to th e Schedule of Assessments in Table 1. 
Clinical laboratory tests will be performed by [CONTACT_779]’s local laboratory. Results of laboratory tests will be rec orded in the eCRF.  
The Investigator or qualified sub-Investigator should review and evaluate out of range laboratory results. Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory value should be immediately re- checked 
whenever possible and documented as an AE as applicable.  
Clinical laboratory tests that will be performed for this study are listed in Table 5.

Serum pregnancy tests will be performed on WOCBP at the screening visit. WOCBP must have 
a negative pregnancy screening in order to continue in the study. Additional urine pregnancy tests will be provided by [CONTACT_288564] ( Table 1 ). A negative pregnancy test result must be obtained before the 
administratio n of the study drug. 
A pregnancy test does not need to be performed on women who are postmenopausal for at least 
[ADDRESS_351643], at any dose, that is not necessarily related to the treatment. 
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and/or unintended sign, symptom or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a medicinal product, regardless of whether it is considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can also arise from any use of the drug and from any route of 
administration, formulation or dose. This definition includes intercurrent illnesses or injuries and 
exacerbation of preexisting conditions as well as events attributed to protocol- mandated 
Protocol Amendment 3.0 CAEL101 -203 Phase 2         CAEL -101

Page 49 of 73  procedures. A clinical laboratory abnormality will only be reported as an AE if it is deemed 
clinically significant by [CONTACT_11219]/or is associated  with signs and symptoms, requires 
treatment or requires follow-up. 
An AE does not include the following: 
• A medical or surgical procedure (e.g. surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction or 
transfusion); an AE is the underlying condition that leads to the procedure  
• Pre-existing diseases or conditions present or detected before the start of study drug 
administration that do not worsen or increase in severity or frequency after the administration of study drug 
• Situations where an untoward medical occurrence has not occurred (e.g. hospi[INVESTIGATOR_22215] a condition that has not worsened on study, social and/or convenience admissions to grant families respi[INVESTIGATOR_22216] a patient). 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Event Reporting and Follow- up 
All AEs will be assessed by [CONTACT_288565] (CRF). Data to be entered includes but is not limited to the following: the event term, the date of onset and 
resolution, seriousness, severity, relationship to study drug, outcome, treatment of the event and 
action taken with the study drug. AEs will be reported starting from the date of signing of the ICF until day 140 (5 months) after the last dose of study drug. 
An AE occurring after the patient has provided written informed consent and before the fi rst 
dose of study treatment will be collected as a pre -treatment AE.  
Example 1: 
Thrombophlebitis associated with a blood draw for assessments required prior to dosing per 
protocol is an event that is related to protocol-mandated procedures. In this scenario, the event of “thrombophlebitis” will be captured as an AE and it will be documented as being “unrelated” to the study drug. 
Example 2: 
An ankle sprain following an unexpected fall from a flight of stairs while at home, after the 
patient has provided informed consent, but before the first dose of study drug, is clearly 
unrelated to any protocol-mandated procedures and would also be captured as an AE. 
All ongoing AEs will be followed to resolution or for 140 days after the patient’s last dose of 
study drug, whichever is earlier. In case the AE has not completely resolved by [CONTACT_288566], the final outcome of the ongoing AE will be captured as “Not Recovered/Not Resolved” or “Recovering/Resolving”, whichever is applicable. Any new A Es occurring after 
the end of treatment visit will not be captured unless related to the study drug. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Grading of Adverse Event  
The severity of an event and the seriousness are not to be considered synonymous. The severity 
is grading the intensity of an event. The seriousness of an event is based on the patient/event 
outcome or action. All AEs will be assessed for severity using NCI-CTCAE version 5 by [CONTACT_288567] 3.0 CAEL101 -203 Phase 2         CAEL -101 
Alexion Pharmaceuticals , Inc.               18 July 2022 
Page 50 of 73  Investigator. If a particular AE is not listed in the NCI -CTCAE, the following criteria will be 
used: 
• Grade 1 (Mild): the event results in mild or transient discomfort, not requiring or needing 
only minimal intervention or treatment; does not limit or interfere with daily activities 
(e.g., insomnia, mild headache). 
• Grade 2 (Moderate): the event is sufficientl y discomforting so as to limit or interfere with 
daily activities; may require interventional treatment (e.g., fever requiring antipyretic medication).  
• Grade 3 (Severe): the event results in significant symptoms that prevent normal daily 
activities; may re quire hospi[INVESTIGATOR_84006]. 
• Grade 4: Life threatening or disabling. 
• Grade 5: Death  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Causality Relationship of Adverse Event 
The relationship of each AE to the study drug as applicable will be evaluated by [CONTACT_288568]: 
• Not related: The AE is clearly not related to the study drug. The AE can be explained to be likely related to other factors such as concomitant medications or the patient’s clinical state.  
• Possibly related: The AE may be related to the st udy drug. A plausible temporal sequence 
exists between the time of administration of the study drug and the development of the AE, and it follows a known response pattern to the study drug. The reaction may have 
been produced by [CONTACT_102]’s clinical state or other concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_288538]. 
• Related: The AE is clearly related to the study drug. A plausible temporal sequence exists between the time of administration of the study drug and the development of the AE, and it follows a known response pattern to the study drug. The occurrence of the AE can be confirmed with a positive re-challenge test or supporting laboratory data. 
The causality criteria of related and possibly related will be considered “related” to the study drug for regulatory reporting requirements. 
9.3. Serious Adverse Event Definition  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death  
o Death is an outcome of an AE and not an AE in itself. 
o All events leading to death (except natural disease progress), regardless of causality, must be reported. 
Protocol Amendment 3.0 CAEL101 -203 Phase 2         CAEL -101 
Alexion Pharmaceuticals , Inc.               18 July 2022 
Page 51 of 73  • Is life threatening, i.e., in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], the AE places the patient at 
immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred; it does not include a reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. 
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_288539], or 
prolongation of an existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_107273] a patient’s 
participation in a clinical study, except for those due to the following: 
o A surgery or procedure that was planned before the patient entered the study and which is part of the planned study procedure is not an SAE 
o Nonmedical reasons, in the absence of an AE, are not considered SA Es 
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect 
• Is an important medical event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above. 
9.4. Disease Progression – Not Reportable as an AE  
It is anticipated that during this study a proportion of patients will experience progression of their 
AL amyloidosis resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_288540]. Such events 
leading to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_288541] a study patient are typi[INVESTIGATOR_56388] “serious”, requiring 
submission of an SAE report. However, reporting the term “disease progression” as either an AE or SAE  in this study is not necessary. 
9.5. SAE Reporting and Follow -up 
All SAEs regardless of causality attribution will be reported from the date of signing of the ICF through 140 days following the patient’s last dose of study drug. Any SAEs occurring after ICF 
signature [CONTACT_288586]- treatment SAEs. All SAEs 
will be reported to Alexion Global Drug Safety (GDS) within 24 hours of the Investigator or site 
staff awareness using the paper Safety Report Form via email: [EMAIL_5656]  or 
facsimile: +1 -[PHONE_5981]. All paper forms MUST be accompanied by [CONTACT_288569]/Fax Cover Sheet signed by [CONTACT_91564]-Investigator. The timelines for reporting SAE information to Alexion GDS need to be followed for the initial SAE report and 
for all follow -up SAE information. SAEs deemed possibly related to protocol- specified 
procedures occurring after the patient signed the ICF will also be reported to the Sponsor drug 
safety representative within 24 hours of when the site becomes aware of the event. In addition, if, 
in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], an SAE occurring outside the specified time window occurs 
and is deemed to be related to study drug, the event will be reported to the Sponsor drug safety representative within 24 hours of when the site becomes aware of it. 
Any additional records (such as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], consultant reports and autopsy findings) are to be provided upon Sponsor request. 
Protocol Amendment 3.[ADDRESS_351644] (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) 
will be done in accordance with the procedures and policies of the IRB/IEC. Documentation 
must be provided to the sponsor, showing that the IRB/IEC was properly notified. SAEs will be reported by [CONTACT_288570]. 
All SAEs will be followed until resolution, stabilization of condition, return to baseline, 30 days 
from the end of the study or until follow-up is no longer possible. 
9.5.1. Expedited Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
The Sponsor will report all relevant information about suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) in accordance with International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Good 
Clinical Practice (GCP), Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and all applicable regulatory guidelines. The Sponsor will also inform all Investigators as required. When required due to local regulations, the Investigator will provide expedited reports to the IRB/IEC. 
9.5.2. Pregnancy  
The Sponsor will be notified within 24 hours of the initial report and any follow-up reports of a 
female patient or a male patient’s female partner becoming pregnant during the course of the 
study and for [ADDRESS_351645] be discontinued immediately.  
A pregnancy notification form is provided by [CONTACT_288571].  
Cases of pregnancy that occur during maternal or paternal exposure to study drug will be 
reported to Alexion GDS within 24 hours of Investigator or site staff awareness using the 
Pregnancy Report Form via email: [EMAIL_5656]
 or facsimile: +1 -[PHONE_5981]. 
All paper forms MUST be accompanied by [CONTACT_288572]/Fax Cover Sheet signed by [CONTACT_91564]-Investigator. 
Pregnancy, although reportable, is not considered an AE/SAE unless a female patient or a male patie nt’s female partner experiences signs or symptoms of pregnancy complications. Female 
patients who become pregnant and female partners of male patients will be followed until the outcome of the pregnancy is known. Pregnancy follow-up should describe the out come of the 
pregnancy, including any voluntary or spontaneous termination, details of the birth and the presence or absence of any congenital abnormalities or birth defects of the offspring. 
Protocol Amendment 3.[ADDRESS_351646] and daratumumab. 
The statistical methods are consistent with these objectives. Specifically, the use of descriptive  
statistics is the primary method for presentation of data outcomes; descriptive statistics 
(and by-patient listings of data) will form the basis from which conclusions regarding study 
objectives will be made. There are no plans to generate inferential (e. g., p- values) statistics, 
as the sample size is generally insufficient to allow for use of such methods.  
In general, data will be tabulated by [CONTACT_288573], recognizing that if a given cohort has only N=2 or 3 patients, that the interpretation of 
descriptive statistics is limited. All data will be listed by [CONTACT_117313], with the primary determination of safety/tolerability outcomes based on review of these data listings. 
Figures/graphics of by- patient d ata will be presented where these will enable optimal review of 
outcomes across dose levels and over time.  
Consistent with the study objectives for Part A vs Part B (as well as due to the number of cohorts in this study), Part A data may be tabulated separ ately from Part B data. This will allow for 
review of data in the context of the objectives for each study part. Further, analysis populations 
and other analysis considerations may be performed separately for Part A from Part B, where appropriate. 
10.2. Determin ation of Sample Size  
The Part A sample size was based on similar studies in which a safe dose is to be selected for use in future larger efficacy/safety clinical trials (and thus the sample size was not selected based on 
a specific testable study hypothesi s). A sample size of N=3 patients for a given dose level 
without a DLT is judged to be clinically sufficient to allow for escalation to the next higher dose 
level. For both Part A and Part B, a sample size of N=6 patients for a given CAEL-101/SoC 
treatment  regimen is judged to be sufficient to allow for determination of tolerability in 
expectation that the CAEL -101/SoC regimen may be used in the subsequent Phase 3 programs. 
The total study sample size will be data -driven and dependent upon how many doses ar e tested 
and safety and tolerability outcomes from that testing. 
10.3. Replacement of Patients  
For Part A, patients who discontinue for non-safety reasons prior to the DLT period having 
elapsed may be replaced.  
Protocol Amendment 3.0 CAEL101 -203 Phase 2         CAEL -101 
Alexion Pharmaceuticals , Inc.               18 July 2022 
Page 54 of 73  10.4. Analysis Sets  
Several populations will be identified for purposes of analysis. 
• Safety Population: All subjects treated with at least one dose of CAEL -101 (the study 
treatment) will be included in the Safety Population.  
• PK Population: The PK Population will include all subjects who have sufficient PK 
concentrations to be included in the PK analysis. The study pharmacokineticist will 
determine which patients have sufficient data to be included in the PK population and will document instances where a patient is excluded.  
• ADA Population: The ADA Analysis S et (AAS ) includes all study participants who 
received any study drug and who after the first dose have at least one reportable result 
in the ADA assay. ADA analysis in study participants will be conducted based on the 
actual treatment they receive . 
For Part A, this study will include cohort safety reviews after the DLT observation periods. Analyses for these reviews may include data listings, tabulations and graphs. 
For Part A, an analysis will be performed for the completed cohorts (dosing levels) and an 
abbreviated CSR will be generated to document the findings and conclusions for the selected 
dose to be carried forward into the subsequent study. This report will be limited to the data 
collected to inform the dose selection decision.  
After study completion, a final ICH- compliant clinical study report will be written that will 
include both study parts. 
10.5. Planned Analyses  
10.5.1. Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Baseline characteristics (including age, gender, race, disease Stage, and other disease -specific 
characteristics) will be tabulated descriptively (e.g., number and percent of subjects for each 
category for categorical parameters, and the number, mean, standard deviation, and range for 
continuous parameters). 
Additionally, NYHA status (see Appendix D ) and organ involvement will be summarized. 
10.5.2. Subject Disposition  
Subject completion status and reasons for early termination will be tabulated descriptively. 
Exposure characteristics will be tabulated (i.e., number of pati ents treated with each dose level, 
and number of doses of CAEL-101 received). Total dose given will be tabulated by [CONTACT_9084]. 
10.5.3. Safety  
Safety assessments will include AEs, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, physical examinations 
and ECGs. In Part A, the i ncidence of DLTs will be evaluated for each dose escalation cohort.  
All treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) will be summarized by [CONTACT_288549]. All TEAEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_12035], severity and 
potential causality to study drug.

Alexion Pharmaceuticals , Inc.               18 July 2022 
Page 55 of 73  Clinical laboratory tests and vital signs will be summarized descriptively for each dose cohort 
and/or study part. All abnormal findings in clinical laboratory test results, vital signs, physical 
examinations and ECGs will be listed.  
Adverse events will be coded using the MedDRA coding dictionary; subject incidence of each 
system organ class and unique term will be tabulated. AE incidence will also be tabulated 
according to relationship to study medication and severity. Serious AEs and AEs resulting in premature discontinuation will be tabulated.  
Adverse events starting after the first dose of treatment will be considered treatment- emergent 
AEs and will be reported as occurring during the treatment phase and will be associated with the 
most recent treatment (dose level) given.  
10.5.4. Efficacy  
Summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, standard error of mean < minimum, maximum, 95% confidence interval) will be presented for the following efficacy endpoint. No hypothesis testing will be performed.  
• Cardiac:  
− NT-proBNP 
− cTnT/cTnI  
− Global Longitudinal Strain 
• Renal:  
− 24-hour urine protein 
• Hepatic:  
− Alkaline phosphatase 
The organ- specific outcomes for renal, hepatic, and cardiac biomarker response will be assessed 
using both retrospective and prospective data. The retrospective collection may include a review of the patient record at the site. Further, prospective data collection has been added to collect future organ response outcomes. The combination of retrospective and prospective data 
collection will allow for a more robust determination of the effects of CAEL -101 on efficacy in 
patients with AL amyloidosis.  
10.5.5. Immunogenicity  
Immunogenicity assessments will be listed and tabulated as provided in the SAP. 
10.5.6. Pharmacokinetics  
Whil e PK parameters will be tabulated and summarized with descriptive statistics by [CONTACT_288574]/or study part, the primary assessment of PK concentrations will be via by- patient data 
assessment (including listings and figures of PK data over time). In addition, the PK profile of 
CAEL -101 when given bi- weekly  (q2wk) versus  once-monthly (q4wk) after the first 50 weeks 
will be assessed via population PK modeling. Details will be provided in a separate population 
PK SAP.

12.1. Changes to the Protocol  
The Investigator may not deviate from the protocol without a formal protocol amendment having been established and approved by [CONTACT_4215]/IEC except when necessary to eliminate 
immediate hazards to the patient. Pr otocol deviations may result in the requirement to withdraw 
the patient from the study and may render their data not evaluable. 
12.2. Monitoring  
In accordance with the Code of Federal Regulations 21CFR 312 Subpart D, ICH GCP and local regulations, the study moni tor will assess the adequacy of Investigator site research facilities and 
evaluate the progress of the study. The monitor will verify the accuracy and completeness of the 
CRF; ensure that all protocol requirements are being met, that Investigator responsibilities are 
being fulfilled and provide aid and support to ensure any inconsistencies in study records are 
satisfactorily resolved.  
12.3. Data Protection  
Each patient will be assigned a unique identifier after signing the ICF. Patient numbers will not be reassigned. Any patient records or datasets transferred to the Sponsor must contain only the 
unique identifier and must not include patient names or any information which would make the 
patient identifiable. Patients will be informed that their personal study- related data will be used 
by [CONTACT_288575], IRB/IEC members and by [CONTACT_91061]. Study monitors will inspect all documents and records that are required to be maintained by [CONTACT_288576]. 
12.4. Audits and Inspections  
The Sponsor or designee may conduct monitoring and auditing activities at the Investigator site at any time during study conduct or after completion of the study. The Investigator will be informed if an audit is to take place and advised as to its scope. Inspections and audits will 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_288542], and data are generated, documented and reported in compliance with the 
protocol, ICH GCP, written SOPs and applicable regulations and laws. 
Representatives of the FDA or other regulatory agencies and IRB/IEC representatives may also 
conduct an audit of the study. If informed of such an inspection, the Investigator should notify the Sponsor immediately. The Investigator will ensure that the auditors have access to the 
clinical supplies and study site facilities and that all data, including o riginal source records and 
study files are available upon request.

Page 69 of 73  APPENDIX E   COVID -19 RISK ASSESSMENT   
AL amyloidosis can cause irreversible morbidity and even mortality, if untreated. As such, the 
benefit a participant may receive from treatment with CAEL -101 is potentially significant.  
Given that treatment for AL amyloidosis does involve immunosuppression, there is a theoretical 
concern that the risk for infection may be higher than in participants not receiving 
immunosuppressants. However, there is no specific data to further inform this risk. No 
participant should be discontinued or excluded from the study due to COVID-19 infection. The site Investigator will therefore balance the risk/benefit considerations in the study participant taking these factors into account.  
The potential operational risks identified and mitigation measures put in place in light of the 
COVID-19 pandemic are provided in Table 7.

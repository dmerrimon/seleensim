 1. OBJECTIVES  
 
1.1 Study  Design  
This is an open, single -arm, phase II multi -center study designed to investigate the efficacy and 
safety of bevacizumab and atezolizumab in patients with advanced non -clear cell renal cell 
carcinoma (nccRCC). Eligible patients will be enrolled and will be treated with beva cizumab 15 
mg/kg intravenously (IV) every 3 weeks and atezolizumab 1 200 mg IV every 3 weeks. Patients 
will be required to undergo a mandatory baseline fresh tumor biopsy if deemed medically 
feasible and safe. Patients will remain on therapy until radiograp hic progression, unacceptable 
adverse events, or other reason. Each cycle will be 3 weeks in duration. Patients who experience 
relapse after an initial response will be required to undergo a fresh tumor biopsy if medically 
safe. Patients will be evaluated clinically every 3 weeks and will undergo disease assessments 
with i maging every 6 weeks. Expected enrollment is 60 patients with an accrual rate of 3 patients 
per month.  
 
 
1.2 Primary  Objectives  
 
To assess the overall response rate (ORR) by [CONTACT_853441] n Criteria In Solid Tumors 
(RECIST) version 1.1 in patients with adv anced nccRCC treated with bevacizumab and 
atezolizumab.  
 
1.3 Secondary  Objectives  
• To assess duration of ORR in patients with advanced nccRCC treated with 
bevacizumab and  atezolizumab  
• To estimate the ORR according to histology  subtypes  
• To assess the safety in p atients with advanced nccRCC treated with bevacizumab and  
atezolizumab.  
• To assess the immune -related ORR in patients with advanced nccRCC treated with 
bevacizumab and  atezolizumab by [CONTACT_44859] -related response criteria  (irRC).  
• To assess progression -free survi val (PFS) in patients with advanced nccRCC treated 
with bevacizumab and  atezolizumab.  
• To assess overall survival (OS) in patients with advanced nccRCC treated  with 
bevacizumab and  atezolizumab.  
• To summarize ORR, PFS, and OS in patients with advanced nccRCC  treated with 
bevacizumab and atezolizumab according to  subgroups:  
o International mRCC Database Consortium (IMDC) risk  groups.  
o Untreated versus previously treated  patients.  
o According to histologic subtype (papi[INVESTIGATOR_853401]. other nccRCC  subtypes; 
sarcomatoid co mponents present vs.  absent)  
• To evaluate the effect of therapy on quality of life as assessed by [CONTACT_245676] -Kidney Sympto m Index (FKSI) -19 and the Brief 
Fatigue Inventory  (BFI)

1.4 Exploratory  Objectives  
• To assess the immunom odulatory properties of atezolizumab in combination with 
bevacizumab via assessment of archival and/or fresh tumor tissue and blood and 
corre late with ORR, PFS, and  OS 
• To evaluate the relationship between programmed death -ligand 1 (PD -L1) tumor 
expression (and other prognostic and predictive tissue biomarkers) and efficacy 
outcomes (ORR, PFS,  OS) 
• To evaluate the relationship between PD -L1 status in archival tissue and in  fresh tumor  
specimens  
• To evaluate mechanisms of acquired resistance to atezolizumab in combination with 
bevacizumab in fresh tumor specimens obtained at time of radiographic progression  
• To assess molecular mechanisms of resistance to treatment via cfDNA  assessment and to 
correlate cfDNA molecular profile with metastasis biopsy molecular prof ile. 
• Assess mechanisms of response and resistance to treatment via single cell molecular 
assessment (exome, genome, and  transcriptome assessment)  
• Correlate single cell molecular profile with metastasis biopsy molecular profile

Protocol Version Date: November 4, [ADDRESS_1187700] common cancer of the kidney (>85%) and represents a heterogeneous disease 
divided generally into two major groups: clear -cell RCC (ccRCC), which comprises 
approximately 80% of renal epi[INVESTIGATOR_220], and nccRCC, which encompasses t he remaining 
percentage of tumors. Non -clear cell RCC includes different histologic and genetic subtypes t o 
include: papi[INVESTIGATOR_1396], chromophobe, collecting duct, unclassified, translocation, and medullary 
carcinoma. Papi[INVESTIGATOR_853402] t for 80% of all nccRCC.  
 
Although many advances have been made in the treatment of metastatic RCC, the ma jority of 
studies to date have been limited to patients with a component of clear -cell disease. Three 
randomized clinical trials included patients wit h nccRCC. The Global ARCC trial phase III trial 
randomized 626 patients with previously untreated poor -risk metastatic RCC, including 73 
patients with nccRCC, to receive temsirolimus versus interferon -α (IFNα) or the combination. 
Post hoc subgroup analysis  of this study suggested that mTOR inhibition could be a valid option 
in nccRCC (PFS 7.[ADDRESS_1187701] ratio (HR) 0.38, 95% confidence interval (CI) 
0.29-0.85; PS 11.6 versus 4.3 months, HR 0.49, 95% CI 0.29 -0.85).[ADDRESS_1187702] trial evaluating temsirolimus versus 
soarfenib included 90 patients with nccRCC. In a single arm phase II study, sunitinib was 
examined as a treatment for patients with non -clear cell histology.2 The ORR was  5% and the 
median PFS was 2.[ADDRESS_1187703] -line PFS in nccRCC in comparison 
with ccRCC and revealed a dismal prognosis in this population with an OS of 12.8 months 
comp ared to 22.8  months.  
 
Due to the poor prognosis of these heterogeneous populations, there is an urgent need for better 
treatment paradigms to improve outcomes for these patients.  
 
2.2 Bevacizumab  
 
2.2.1  Clinical Activity in  RCC  
Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody that bi nds circulating (vascular endothelial growth 
factor) VEGF and prevents its interaction with the VEGF receptor. Bevacizumab has been 
studied in a multitude of Phase I, II, and III clinical trials in more than 22,[ADDRESS_1187704] demonstrated improved 
PFS with bevacizumab plus IFNα compared with IFNα alone. In the AVOREN trial, 649

previously untreated patients were randomly assigne d to IFNα (9 million units three times p er 
week for one year) plus either bevaci zumab (10 mg/kg IV every two weeks) or placebo4-6. 
Bevacizumab (or placebo) was continued until there was evidence of progressive disease. IFNα 
plus bevacizumab resulted in the following compared with IFNα plus place bo: 1) an increase in 
PFS (median 10.2 versus 5.5 month s HR 0.63, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45 -0.72), 2) a 
significantly higher ORR (31 versus 13%), and 3) a trend toward improved OS (median survi val 
23.3 versus 21.3 months, HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.72 -1.04) . Approximately 60% of patients received 
second -line therapy, potentially obscuring a survival difference between the two treatment arms. 
There were more common serious adverse events (SAEs) in patient s treatment with bevacizumab 
(29 versus 16%). Grade 3 o r 4 adverse events that were more common in patients treated with 
bevacizumab included thromboembolic events (3 versus 1%) and gastrointestinal (GI) 
perforation (1 versus  0%).  
 
In the Cancer and Leukem ia Group B (CALBG) [ZIP_CODE] trial, 732 previously untreate d patients 
with metastatic RCC were randomly assigned to IFNα plus bevacizumab (10 mg/kg IV every 2 
weeks) or IFNα plus placebo on schedules similar to that used in the AVOREN trial.7 Treatment 
with be vacizumab plus IFNα resulted in: 1) an improvement in P FS (median 8.5 versus 5.2 
months; HR 0.71, 0.61 -0.83) a nd a significant improvement in the ORR (25.5 versus 13.1%).  
There was a trend toward improved OS favoring the use of combination therapy (median 18.3 
versus 17.4 months, HR 0.86, p = 0.07).[ADDRESS_1187705] that 
more than one -half of patients on both arms received second -line therapy, including VEGF - 
targeted therapy in 46% of those originally treated with IFNα al one. 
 
There is data to support the use of bevacizumab i n patients with metastatic nccRCC. A phase II 
study evaluated the efficacy of bevacizumab (15 mg/kg IV every 3 weeks) alone in patient with 
advanced papi[INVESTIGATOR_31887].[ADDRESS_1187706] udy before the protocol was closed 
due to slow accrual.  Three patients had undergone a prior nephrectomy, one patient underwent 
resection of a liver metastasis, and one patient had received prior temsirolimus. The PFS for 
these patients was 25, 15, 11, 10 and 6 months.  
 
These results supported the Food and Dru g Administration (FDA) approval of bevacizumab with 
IFNα in metastatic RCC in July 2009.  
 
2.2.2  Safety  Profile  
Hypertension: An increased incidence of hypertension (all grades) of up to 42.1% has been 
observed in patients treated with bevacizumab compared to up to 14% in the comparator arm. In 
clinical trials across all indications the overall incidence of National Cancer Institute -Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI -CTCAE) Grade 3 and 4  hypertension in patients 
receiving bevacizumab ranged from 0.4% to 17.9%. Grade 4 hypertension (hypertensive crisis) 
occurred in up to 1.0% of bevacizumab -treated patients, compared to up to 0.2% of patients 
treated with the same chemotherapy alone. Very rare cases of hypertensive encephalopathy have 
been rep orted, some of which were fatal. The risk of bevacizumab -associated hypertension did 
not correlate with the patients’ baseline characteristics, underlying disease or concomitant 
therapy. Analyses of th e clinical safety data suggest that the occurrence of h ypertension with 
bevacizumab therapy is likely to be dose -dependent.

Proteinuria: In clinical trials, proteinuria has been reported within the range of 0.7% to 38% of 
patients receiving bevacizumab. Proteinuria ranged in severity from clinically asymptom atic, 
transient, trace proteinuria to nephrotic syndrome. Grade 3 proteinuria was reported in up to 
8.1% of treated patients. Grade 4 proteinuria (nephrotic syndrome) was seen in up to 1.4 % of 
treated patients. The proteinuria seen in bevacizumab clinical trials was not associated with renal 
impairment and rarely required permanent discontinuation of bevacizumab therapy.  
Analyses of the clinical safety data suggest that the occurrence of proteinuria with bevacizumab 
therapy is likely to be dose -dependent. P atients with a history of hypertension may be at 
increased risk for the development of proteinuria when treated with bevacizumab. There is 
evidence suggesting that Grade 1 proteinuria may be related to bevacizumab dose.  
 
Venous thromboembolism (VTE, includ ing deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, 
and thrombophlebitis): Patients may be at risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_853403], including pulmonary 
embolism under bevacizumab treatment.  In clinical trials across all indications the overall 
incidence of VTE events was 2 .8%-17.3% in the bevacizumab -containing arms compared with 
3.2% -15.6% in the chemotherapy control arms. Grade [ADDRESS_1187707] been reported in up to 
7.8% of patients treated with chemotherapy plus bevacizumab compared with up to 4.9% in 
patients with chemoth erapy alone. Patients who have experienced a VTE may be at higher risk 
for a recurrence if they receive bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy versus 
chemotherapy alo ne. 
 
From a clinical trial in patients with persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cer vical cancer (study 
GOG -0240), grade [ADDRESS_1187708] been reported in up to 10.6% of patients treated with 
chemotherapy and bevacizumab compared with up to 5.4% in patients w ith chemotherapy alone. 
In clinical trial BO21990, Grade 3 -5 VTEs were observed in 7 .6% of patients with newly 
diagnosed glioblastoma treated with bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy and 
radiotherapy, compared to 8.0 % of patients treated with che motherapy and radiotherapy alone.  
 
Arterial Thromboembolism (ATE): An increased inci dence of ATE events was observed in 
patients treated with bevacizumab across indications including cerebrovascular accidents, 
myocardial infarction, transient ischemic atta cks, and other ATEs. In clinical trials, the overall 
incidence ranged up to 5.9% in the bevacizumab - containing arms compared up to 1.7% in the 
chemotherapy control arms. Fatal outcome was reported in 0.8% of patients receiving 
bevacizumab in combination w ith chemotherapy compared to 0.5% of patients receiving 
chemotherapy alone. Cerebrov ascular accidents (including transient ischemic attacks) were 
reported in up to 2.3% of bevacizumab treated patients versus 0.5% of patients in the control 
group. Myocardia l infarction was reported in 1.4% of bevacizumab treated versus 0.7% of 
patients in the observed control group.  
 
In one clinical trial, AVF2192g, patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who were not 
candidates for treatment with irinotecan were included . In this trial ATEs were observed in 11% 
(11/100) of bevacizumab patients compared to 5.8% (6/104) in the chemotherapy control group. 
In an uncontrolled clinical trial, AVF3708g, in patients with relapsed glioblastoma, ATEs were 
observed in 6.3% (5/79) of  patients who received bevacizumab in combination with irinotecan 
compared to 4.8% ( 4/84) of patients who received bevacizumab alone.

Gastrointestinal perforation: Bevacizumab has been associated with se rious cases of GI 
perforation. GI perforations have been reported in clinical trials with an incidence of <1% in 
patients with metastatic breast cancer or non -squamous NSCLC, up to 2% in metastatic RCC, 
newly diagnosed glioblastoma, or in patients with ova rian cancer receiving front -line treatment, 
and up to 2.7% (including GI fistula and abscess) in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. 
Cases of GI perfor ations have also been observed in patients with relapsed glioblastoma. Fatal 
outcome was reported  in approximately a third of serious cases of GI perforations, which 
represents between 0.2 -1.0% of all bevacizumab treated patients.  
 
In bevacizumab clinical trials, GI fistulae (all grade) have been reported with an incidence of up 
to 2% in patients with  metastatic colorectal cancer and ovarian cancer, but were also reported 
less commonly in patients with other types of cancer. From a clinical trial in patient s with 
persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer (study GOG -0240), GI perforations, in cluding 
GI fistulae and abscess (all grade) were reported in 10.1% of bevacizumab treated patients, all of 
whom had a history of prior pelvic radiation. Fatal outcome was reported in 0.9% of 
bevacizumab -treated patients. Most patients reported as having G I perforations in this study (15 
out of 22) had GI -vaginal fistulae. The presentation of these events varied in type and severity, 
ranging from free air seen o n the plain abdominal X -ray, which resolved without treatment, to 
intestinal perforation with abd ominal abscess and fatal outcome. In some cases underlying intra - 
abdominal inflammation was present, either from gastric ulcer disease, tumor necrosis, 
divert iculitis or chemotherapy -associated colitis. A causal association of intra -abdominal 
inflammatory  process and GI perforation to bevacizumab has not been established. Patients may 
be at increased risk for the development of GI perforation and gallbladder pe rforation when 
treated with bevacizumab.  
 
Fistula: Bevacizumab use has been associated with serio us cases of fistulae including events 
resulting in death. From a clinical trial in patients with persistent, recurrent, or metastatic 
cervical cancer (study GOG -0240), 4.1% of bevacizumab -treated patients and 2.3% of control 
patients were reported to have had vaginal, vesical or female genital tract fistulae (all grade), 
some of which were GI vaginal fistulae. The overall rate of GI -vaginal fistulae (al l grade), 
combining both those reported as GI perforations and those reported as fistulae and abscess (as 
stated above) was 8.2% in bevacizumab -treated patients and 0.9% in control patients.  
Uncommon (≥0.1% to <1%) reports of other types of fistulae that involve areas of the body other 
than the GI tract (e.g., bronchopleural, urogenital, biliary fistulae) were  observed across various 
indications.  Fistulae have also been reported in post -marketing experience. Events were reported

Wound healing complications: Bevacizumab may adversely affect the woun d healing process. 
Serious wound healing complications with a fatal outcome have been reported. Necrotizing 
fasciitis including fatal cases, has rarely been reported in patients treated with bevacizumab; 
usually secondary to wound healing complications, GI  perforation or fistula formation.  
 
As bevacizumab may adversely impact wound healing, patients who had major surgery within 
the last [ADDRESS_1187712] -operative bleeding or wound healing complications occurring within 60 days of major 
surgery was observed if the patient was being trea ted with bevacizumab at the time of surgery.  
The incidence varied between 10% (4/40) and 20% (3/15).  
 
In locally recurrent  and metastatic breast and ovarian cancer trials, Grade 3 -5 wound healing 
complications were observed in up to 1.1% of patients receiv ing bevacizumab compared with up 
to 0.9 % of patients in the control arms. In the study of patients with relapsed glioblas toma 
(study AVF3708g), the incidence of post -operative wound healing complications (craniotomy 
site wound dehiscence and cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_853405]) was 3.6% in patients treated with single - 
agent bevacizumab and 1.3% in patients treated with bevacizumab plu s irinotecan. In patients 
with newly diagnosed glioblastoma (study BO21990) the incidence of Grade [ADDRESS_1187713] -operative 
wound healing co mplications (including complications following craniotomy) was 3.3% when 
treated with bevacizumab in combination with chem otherapy and radiotherapy, compared with  
1.6 % when treated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy alone.  
 
Hemorrhage: In clinical trials across all indications the overall incidence of NCI -CTC Grade 3 - 
5 bleeding events ranged from 0.4% to 6.9% in bevacizumab -treated patients, compared to 0 to 
4.5% of patients in the chemotherapy control group. The hemorrhagic events that have been 
observed  in bevacizumab clinical studies were predominantly tumor - associated hemorrhage (see 
below) and minor mucocutaneous hemor rhage (e.g. epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940]).  
 
Tumor -Associated Hemorrhage: Major or massive pulmonary hemorrhage or hemoptysis has 
been observed primarily in patients with NSCLC. Possible risk factors include squamous cell 
histology, treatment with anti -rheumatic/anti -inflamma tory drugs, treatment with anticoagulants, 
prior radiotherapy, bevacizumab therapy, previous medical history of atherosclerosis, centr al 
tumor location and cavitation of tumors prior to or during therapy. The only variables that 
showed statistically signif icant correlations with bleeding were bevacizumab therapy and 
squamous cell histology. Patients with NSCLC of known squamous cell hist ology or mixed cell 
type with predominant squamous cell histology were excluded from subsequent studies, while 
patients wi th unknown tumor histology were included.  
 
In patients with NSCLC excluding predominant squamous histology, all Grade events were seen  
with a frequency of up to 9% when treated with bevacizumab plus chemotherapy compared with

to 2.3% of patients treated with bevacizumab plus chemotherapy as co mpared with <1% with 
chemotherapy alone. Major or massive pulmonary hemorrhage/hemoptysis can occur sudd enly 
and up to two thirds of the serious pulmonary hemorrhages resulted in a fatal outcome.  
 
Mucocutaneus Hemorrage: Across all bevacizumab clinical tri als, mucocutaneous hemorrhage 
has been seen in 50% of patients treated with bevacizumab. These were most  commonly NCI - 
CTC Grade [ADDRESS_1187715] that 
the incidence of minor mucocutaneous hemorrhage (e.g. epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940]) may be dose -dependent.  
There have also been less common events of minor mucocutaneous hemorrhage in other 
locations, such as gingival b leeding and vaginal bleeding.  
 
Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES): PRES is a rare neuro logic disorder 
that can present with the following signs and symptoms (among others): seizures, headache, 
altered mental status, visual disturbance, or cortical blindness, with or without associated 
hypertension. Brain imaging is mandatory to confirm the d iagnosis of PRES. Two confirmed 
cases (0.8%) of PRES have been reported in one clinical study. Symptoms usually resolve or 
improve within days, although  some patients have experienced neurologic sequelae.  
 
Congestive heart failure (CHF): In clinical trials , CHF was observed in all cancer indications 
studied to date, but predominantly in patients with metastatic breast cancer. In five Phase III 
studies (AV F2119g, E2100, BO17708, AVF3694g and AVF3693g) in patients with metastatic 
breast cancer, Grade ≥ 3 CHF was reported in up to 3.5% of patients treated with bevacizumab  in 
combination with chemotherapy compared with up to 0.9% in the control arms. For patie nts in 
study AVF3694g who received anthracyclines concomitantly with bevacizumab, the incidences 
of Grad e ≥ [ADDRESS_1187716] cancer: 2.9% in the anthracycl ine + bevacizumab arm and 0% 
in the anthracycline + placebo arm. In addition, in study AVF3694g the inci dence of any grade 
CHF was similar between the anthracycline + bevacizumab (6.2%) and the anthracycline + 
placebo arms (6.0%). Most patients who develop ed CHF during metastatic breast cancer trials 
showed improved symptoms and/or left ventricular function following appropriate medical 
therapy.  
 
In most clinical trials of bevacizumab, patients with pre -existing CHF of [LOCATION_001] Heart 
Association (NYHA) II – IV were excluded, therefore, no information is available on the risk of 
CHF in this population. Prior a nthracyclines exposure and/or prior radiotherapy to the chest wall 
may be possible risk factors for the development of CHF.  
 
An increased incidence of C HF has been observed in a clinical trial of patients with diffuse large 
B-cell lymphoma (BO20603) when r eceiving bevacizumab with a cumulative doxorubicin dose 
greater than 300 mg/m2. This phase III clinical trial compared 
rituximab/cyclophosphamide/doxoru bicin/vincristine/prednisone (R -CHOP) plus bevacizumab to 
R-CHOP without bevacizumab. While the incidenc e of CHF in both arms was above that 
previously observed for doxorubicin therapy the rate was higher in the R -CHOP plus 
bevacizumab arm.

Events consi stent with CHF were reported in clinical trials. The findings ranged from 
asymptomatic decl ines in left ventricular ejection fraction to symptomatic CHF, requiring 
treatment or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
 
Ovarian Failure/Fertility: The incidence of new cases of ovar ian failure, defined as 
amenorrhoea lasting 3 or more months, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level ≥ 30mIU/ml 
and a negative serum β -HCG pregnancy test, has been evaluated. New cases of ovarian failure 
were reported more frequently in patients receivin g bevacizumab. After discontinuation of 
bevacizumab treatment, ovarian function recovered i n the majority of women. Long term effects 
of treatment with bevacizumab on fertility are unknown.  
 
Neutropenia: Increased rates of severe neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, or infection with severe 
neutropenia (including some fatalities) have been observed  in patients treated with some 
myelotoxic chemotherapy regimens plus bevacizumab in comparison to chemotherapy alone.  
 
Hypersensitivity reactions, infusion reactions: Patients may be at risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_348025]/ 
hypersensitivity reactions. In so me clini cal trials anaphylactic and anaphylactoid -type reactions 
were reported more frequently in patients receiving bevacizumab in combination with 
chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_853406]. The incidence of these reactions in some clinical 
trials of be vacizuma b is common (up to 5% in bevacizumab -treated patients).  
 
Laboratory Abnormalities: Decreased absolute neutrophil count (ANC), decreased white blood 
count (WBC) and presence of urine protein may be associated with bevacizumab treatment.  
Across clini cal tria ls, the following Grade 3 and 4 laboratory abnormalities were seen with an 
increased (≥2%) incidence in patients treated with bevacizumab compared to those in the control 
groups: hyperglycemia, decreased hemoglobin, hypokalemia, hyponatremia, decre ased whi te 
blood cell count, increased prothrombin time (PT), normalized ratio.  
 
Additional Adverse Events: See the bevacizumab drug package insert for additional details

2.3 Atezolizumab  (MPDL3280A)  
Atezolizumab is a  human immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 monoclonal antibody consisting of two heavy 
chains (448 amino acids) and two light chains (214 amino acids) and is produced in Chinese 
hamster ovary cells. Atezolizumab was engineered to eliminate Fc -effector function via a si ngle 
amino acid substitution (asparagine to alanine) at position 298 on the heavy chain, which results 
in a non -glycosylated antibody that has minimal binding to Fc receptors and prevents Fc -effector 
function at expected concentrations in humans. Atezolizu mab targets human PD -L1 and inhibits 
its interaction with its receptor, programmed death -1 (PD -1). Atezolizumab also blocks the 
binding of PD -L1 to B7.1, an interaction that is reported to provide additional inhibitory signals 
to T cells. Atezolizumab is b eing investigated as a potential therapy against solid tumors and 
hematologic malignancies in humans.

activity, to determine in vivo pharmacokinetic (PK) behavior, to demonstrate an acceptable 
safety profile, and to identify a Phase I starting dose. Comprehensive pharmacology, PK, and 
toxicology evaluations were thus undertaken with atezoli zumab.  
 
The safety, pharmacokinetics, a nd toxicokinetics of atezolizumab were investigated in mice and 
cynomolgus monkeys to support IV administration and to aid in projecting the appropriate 
starting dose in humans. Given the similar binding of atezolizumab for cynomolgus monkey and 
human PD -L1, the cynomolgus monkey was selected as the primary and relevant nonclinical 
model for understanding the safety, pharmacokinetics, and toxicokinetics of atezolizumab.  
 
Overall, the nonclinical pharmacokinet ics and toxicokinetics observed for atezolizumab 
supported entry into clinical studies, including providing adequate safety factors for the  proposed 
Phase I starting doses.  The results of the toxicology program were consistent with the 
anticipated pharmac ologic activity of down -modulating the PD -L1/PD -[ADDRESS_1187717] and supported 
entry into clinical trials in patients. Refer to the atezolizumab Investigator’s Brochure for details 
on the nonclinical  studies.  
 
2.3.2 Clinical Experience in RCC and Clinical  Activity  
Ongo ing Phase II Study WO29074 is evaluating the safe ty and efficacy of atezolizumab 
monotherapy or the combination of atezolizumab and bevacizumab versus sunitinib in treatment - 
naïve patients with RCC.  Safety and efficacy data are not yet available for this  study.  
 
As of the data cutoff of 1 January 2014,  efficacy analyses were performed on 386 efficacy 
evaluable patients who were defined as those patients, with measurable disease at baseline, 
treated by 1 July 2013 in Study PCD4989g (to ensure that each pat ient had a minimum of 6 
months follow -up). Patien ts with multiple tumor types were included in the study, with the 
largest cohorts consisting of patients with non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), RCC, and 
bladder cancer. Objective responses with atezolizuma b monotherapy were observed in a broad 
range of m alignancies, including NSCLC, RCC, melanoma, bladder cancer, colorectal cancer, 
head and neck cancer, gastric cancer, breast cancer and sarcoma. Altogether, there were 47 
patients with responses with a media n duration of response of 75.7 weeks (range: 11.7 + to 85.9+ 
weeks, where “+” denotes censored value). The majority of these responses have been durable, 
with 72.3% (34/47) of responses ongoing as of the clinical cutoff date.  
 
Analyses of tumor -infiltrating  immune cells for PD -L1 expression on baseline tu mor tissue have 
been performed for Study PCD4989g. Preliminary results from Study PCD4989g suggest that 
PD-L1 expression in tumor infiltrating immune cells is likely to be associated with response to 
atezoli zumab.  
 
2.3.3 Clinical Pharmacokinetics and  Immunogenic ity 
The fixed dose of 1200 mg (equivalent to an average body weight -based dose of 15 mg/kg) was 
selected on the basis of both nonclinical studies and available clinical data. On the basis of 
available prelim inary PK data (0.03 -20 mg/kg), atezolizumab appea red to show linear 
pharmacokinetics at doses ≥1 mg/kg. For the 1 -mg/kg and 20 -mg/kg dose groups, the mean 
clearance (CL) and the mean volume at steady state (Vss) had a range of 3.20 -4.43 mL/kg and 
48.1-64.1 mL/kg, respectively, which is consistent with th e expected profile of an IgG1 antibody

in humans.  
 
The development of anti -therapeutic antibodies (ATAs) has been observed in patients in all dose 
cohorts and was associated with changes in pharmacokinetics for some patients in the lower dose 
cohorts (0. 3, 1, and 3 mg/kg). The development of detectable ATAs has not had a significant 
impact on pharmacokinetics for doses from 10 -20 mg/kg. Patients dosed at the 10 -, 15-, and 20 - 
mg/kg  dose levels have maintained the expected target trough levels of drug desp ite the detection 
of ATAs. To date, no clear relationship between detection of ATAs and adverse events (AEs) or 
infusion related reactions (IRRs) has been observed.  
 
2.3.[ADDRESS_1187718] been derived mainly from t he treatment of 
patients in Phase Ia Study PCD4989g. As of 10 May 2014, atezolizumab has been administered 
to approximately 775 patients with solid and hematologic malignancies. No dose-limiting 
toxicities (DLTs) have been observed at any dose level, and n o maximum tolerated dose (MTD) 
was established.  Fatigue was the most frequently reported AE.  
 
The following safety data are from PCD4989g, in which atezolizumab is being used as si ngle- 
agent therapy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid t umors or hematologic 
malignancies. In 412 treated patients, 97.1% reported an AE while on study. Of these AEs, 
48.8% were Grade [ADDRESS_1187719] frequently observed AEs (occurring in ≥10% of treated  patients) included fatigue, nausea, 
decreased appetite, pyrexia, dyspnea, diarrhea, constipation, cough, headache, back pain, 
vomiting, anemia, arthralgia, rash, insomnia, asthenia , abdominal pain, chills, pruritus, and upper 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092].  
 
Grade ≥3 AEs were reported by 199 of 412 patients (48.3%). There were 51 patients (12.4%) 
who reported Grade ≥[ADDRESS_1187720] frequently reported related Grade ≥3 AEs included fatigue (5 patients [1.2%]), increased 
alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (each reported 
in 4 patients [1.0%]); and asthenia, autoimmune hepatitis, and hypoxia (each reported in 3 
patients [0.7%]).  
 
Given the mechanism of action of atezolizumab, events associated with inflammation and/or 
immune -mediated AEs have been closely monitored during the atezolizumab clinical program. 
These include potential derma tologic, hepatic, endocrine, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_853407]/elevated liver function tests (LFTs) and influenza -like illness.Expected adverse drug 
reactions associated with atezolizumab include the following: hepatitis/transaminitis, 
hypothyroidism, IRRs, pneumonitis, influenza -like illness, and dermatologic reactions. Potential 
adverse drug reactions include the following: ATAs, colitis, endocrine disorders, 
hypersensitivity, neurologic disorders, and pericardial effusion. For further  details, see the

25 months.9 
 
The rationale for includin g all nccRCC patients stems from histo ric and currently ongoing trials 
in nccRCC which include all non -clear cell histologies. A phase II trial (ESPN) investigated 
outcomes of first -line everolimus compared to sunitinib in nccRCC patients.10 Patients were 
stratified by [CONTACT_27183] (papi[INVESTIGATOR_853401].  others), MSKCC risk groups, and Kaplan -Meier curves were 
used to estimate unadjusted TTE distributions between groups. Accrual was terminated due to 
futility analysis of PFS and inferior OS with everolimus compared to  sunitinib in first -line 
(median OS wi th everolimus was 10.5 months (95% CI), and median OS with sunitinib was not 
reached). Another phase II trial investigated the efficacy of everolumus versus sunitinib in the 
first-line setting in patients with metastat ic nccRCC, with papi[INVESTIGATOR_1396], chromophobe , or any 
unclassified histology (ASPEN).[ADDRESS_1187723] -line setting, including chromophobe and poor risk RCC patients.  
 
Given the small size of this study and the limit ed nccRCC patient population of only 20%, we 
will allow patients have received both first and second line therapi[INVESTIGATOR_853408] a signal of efficacy in this patient population . If a signal of efficacy is 
observed, a large r study in a more homogenous patient population can be considered in the 
future.  
 
Immunotherapy strategies have been used for decades in patients with advanced RCC with 
prolonged survival being seen in a very s mall proportion of patients treated with IFN -α or high - 
dose interleukin -[ADDRESS_1187724] ly expressed on tumor cells and tumor infiltra ting mononuclear cells (TIMC). We 
have previously demonstrated that PD -L1 expression in tumor (10.9%) and TIMC (56.4%) 
occurs in patients with nccRCC and PD -L1 positivity on tumor cell membrane was associated 
with aggressive clinicopathological features.12 Single agent atezolizumab, a monoclonal anti - 
PD-L1 antibody, has been investigated in metastatic ccRCC as detailed in section 2.3.2.  
 
There is rationale for combining VEGF inhibition with immunotherapy. VEGF has profound 
effects on immune regulatory cell  function, specifically inhibiting dendritic cell maturation and 
antigen presentation.13,14 Additionally, there is increasing evidence for the role angiogenic 
factors play in influencing lymphocyte trafficking across endothelia in tumor deposits.15

with sunitinib and  45% (9/20) in patients treated with pazopanib. SD rate was 33% in  the 
sunitinib arm and 35% in the pazopanib arm. 24 week PFS was 78% in the sunitinib arm and 
55% in the pazopanib arm.  
 
A phase 1b study evaluated atezolizumab in combination with bevacizum ab in patients with 
metastatic ccRCC.19  Patients were treated wit h bevacizumab 15 mg/kg alone on cycle 1/day 1 
and atezolizumab 20 mg/kg every [ADDRESS_1187726]-line metastatic RCC patients with one tumor a ssessment (n = 10), the ORR was 40%. An

Given the immunomodulatory properties of VEGF, we hypothesize that the combination of 
atezolizumab and bevacizumab will be synergistic and result in improved response in pati ents 
with metastatic nccRCC. In this study, we propose to evaluate the efficacy  and safety of the

2.5 Correlative Studies  Background  
Immunotherapy has historically had a significant role in the management of metastatic RCC. 
Treatment using IFNα and interleukin -2 (IL -2) results in objective responses in approximately 
5% of patients with RCC and 10% of patients treated with IL -[ADDRESS_1187730] from 
enhancement of immune function by [CONTACT_204773] -L1 axis which may be of critical 
importance in RCC.  
 
PD-L1 is an extracellular protein that downregulates immune responses primarily  in peripheral 
tissues through binding to its two receptors: PD -[ADDRESS_1187731] been 
found to overexpress PD -L1, which acts to suppress anti -tumor immunity. PD -1 is an inhibitor 
receptor expressed on T -cells following T -cell activation, which is sustained in states of chronic 
stimulation, such as chronic infection or chance.20 Ligation of PD -L1 and PD -1 inhibits T -cell 
proliferation, cytokine p roduction, and cytolytic activity, leading to the function inactivation or 
exhaustion of T -cells. B7-1 is a molecular expressed on antigen -presenting cells (APC) and 
activated T -cells. PD -L1 binding to B7 -1 on T cells and APCs can mediate the downregulatio n 
of immune response, including inhibition of T -cell activation and cytokine production.21,22 
 
Aberrant expression of PD -L1 on tumor cells has been reported to impede anti -tumor immunity, 
resulting in immune evasion.23 Therefore the interruption of the PD -L1/PD -[ADDRESS_1187732] which patients may benefit from atezolizumab. A secondary objective is  to assess the 
immunomodulatory properties of atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab by [CONTACT_853442]. In addition, we will correlate levels with the anti-tumor activity of the combination of 
these agents.

Protocol Version Date: November 4, [ADDRESS_1187734] benefit from atezolizumab. Tumor specimens (collected from baseline 
fresh tumor specimens) from patients meeting eligibility  criteria will be tested for PD -L1 
expression and other markers of immunogenicity and angiogenesis. In addition, PD -L1 stat us (as 
defined by [CONTACT_109807] -L1 on tumor cells or TIMC) will be correlated with outcomes.  
Because the expression of PD -L1 on th e surface of both tumor cells and TIMC can be a dynamic 
process and because PD -L1 expression on these cells may vary betwee n primary and metastatic 
sites, mandatory fresh tumor specimens will be collected. Additionally, to investigate 
mechanisms of acquire d resistance to therapy, patients who experience relapse after an initial 
response will be required to undergo a mandatory fresh tumor biopsy if medically safe.

5.3 Atezolizumab  
The dose level of atezolizumab to be tested in this study is 1200 mg (equivalent to an average 
body weight -based dose of 15 mg/ kg) administer ed by [CONTACT_33433] 3 weeks (21 [+/ -3] 
days). Atezolizumab will be delivered in infusion bags with IV infusion lines that have product 
contact[CONTACT_226837] (PVC) or polyolefin and 0.2 um in -line filters (filter 
membra ne of polyethe rsulfone [PES]). No incompatibilities have been observed between 
atezolizumab and PVC or polyolefin infusion materials (bags or infusion lines).  
 
Atezolizumab dose preparation will be done on the day atezolizumab is administered. 
Atezolizumab should be all owed to reach room temperature prior to removal from the vials. The 
product should be administered only using 250 mL 0.9% sodium chloride saline IV bags. The 
required volume of atezolizumab for the patient is [ADDRESS_1187760] be  diluted under 
appropriate  aseptic conditions, as it does not contain antimicrobial preservatives. Once the 
atezolizumab dose solution is prepared, it may be stored at 2°C –8°C (36°F –46°F) and/or at room 
temperature for up to 8 hours prior to the start of i nfusion. However, if the i nfusion is interrupted 
and the combined storage and dose hold time of the diluted IV bags exceeds the 8 -hour limit, 
prepare a new dose solution to resume the infusion.  
If the dose solution is stored at 2°C –8°C (36°F –46°F), it shou ld be removed from refrige ration 
and allowed to reach room temperature prior to administration. Protect dose solutions from 
intense light and heat.  
 
Administration of atezolizumab will be performed in a setting with emergency medical facilities 
and staff w ho are trained to monitor for and respond to medical emergencies.  
 
Atezolizumab will be administered first, followed by [CONTACT_76395], with a minimum of 5 
minutes between dosing. The initial dose of atezolizumab will be delivered over 60 (+/ -15) 
minutes. If the first infusion is tole rated without infusion associated AEs, the second infusion 
may be delivered over 30 (+/ -10) minutes. If the 30 minute infusion is well tolerated, all 
subsequent infusions may be delivered over 30 (+/ -10) minutes. For the first inf usion, the 
patient’s vital  signs (heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], blood pressure, and temperature) should be 
determined within 60 minutes before, during (every 15 [+/ -5] minutes), and 30 (+/ -10) minutes

administered for Cycles ≥2 at the discretion of the treating physician. The management of IRRs 
will be according to severity as follows:  
• In the event that a patient experiences a mild (NC I CTCAE Grade 1) IRR, the infusion 
rate should be reduced to half the rate being given at the time of event onset. Once the 
event has resolved, the investigator should wait for 30 minutes while delivering the 
infusion at the reduced rate. If tolerated, the  infusion rate may then be increased to  the 
original  rate. 
• In the event that a patient experiences a moderate IRR (NCI CTCAE Grade 2) or 
flushing, fever, or throat pain, the infusion should be immediately interrupted and the 
patient should receive aggressi ve symptomatic treatment. The infusion should be 
restarted only after the symptoms have adequately resolved to baseline grade. The 
infusion rate at restart should be half of the infusion rate that was in progress at the time 
of the onset of the  IRR.  
• For se vere or life -threatening IRRs (NCI CTCA E Grade 3 or 4), the infusion should be 
stopped immediately, and aggressive resuscitation and supportive measures should be 
initiated. Patients experiencing severe or life threatening IRRs will not receive further 
infusion and will be further managed as cl inically indicated until the event  resolves.  
 
If bevacizumab is being held atezolizumab can still be administered unless the participant is 
experiencing treatment -emergent toxicities for which the etiology could be related to both 
agents. In this case, bot h drugs should be held. If one or both study agents are being held, study 
assessments (e.g. scans, laboratory assessments, etc.) will remain on schedule as per the study 
calendar.

will be as  a continuous IV infusion. Anaphylaxis pr ecautions should be observed during study 
drug administration.  
 
The initial dose will be delivered over 90 (+/ -15) minutes. If the first infusion is tolerated without 
infusion associated adverse events (fever and/or  chills), the second infusion may be deli vered 
over 60 (+/ -10) minutes. If the 60 minute infusion is well tolerated, all subsequent infusions may 
be delivered over 30 (+/ -10) minutes.  
 
If a subject experiences an infusion –associated AE, he or she may be pr emedicated for the next 
study drug infusi on; however, the infusion time may not be decreased for the subsequent 
infusion. If the next infusion is well tolerated with premedication, the subsequent infusion time 
may then be decreased by 30 (+/ -10) minutes as  long as the subject continues to be

the investigator and recorded as instructed on the study -specific eCRFs.  
 
Patients should receive full supportive car e, including transfusions of blood and blood products, 
antib iotics, anti -emetics, etc., when appropriate. Prophylactic anticoagulation for patency of 
device with oral or parenteral anticoagulants is allowed. Patients who require therapeutic 
anticoagulation  can be maintained on low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) (e .g., enoxaparin 
and tinzaparin) or fondaparinux. In addition, patients requiring therapeutic anticoagulation with 
LMWH during study participation will be allowed to remain on study therapy. Therap eutic 
warfarin is not allowed on study.  
 
Patients who experi ence infusion -associated symptoms may be treated symptomatically with 
acetaminophen, ibuprofen, diphenhydramine, and/or famotidine or another H2 receptor 
antagonist, as per standard practice. Seri ous infusion -associated events manifested by [CONTACT_27926],

Patients who use hormonal therapy with GnRH agonists or antagonists for prostate cancer, oral 
contraceptives, hormone -replacement therapyshould continue their use.  
 
Males and females of reproductive potential should use highly effective mea ns of contraceptio n. 
 
All concomitant medications should be reported to the investigator and recorded on the 
appropriate eCRF.  
 
5.5.2 Prohibited  Therapy  
Any concomitant therapy intended for the treatment of  kidney cancer , whether  health 
authority−approved or exp erimental, is prohibited. This includes but is not limited to the 
following:  
• Chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, investigational  agents, 
or herbal therapy. After Cycle 2, certain forms of radiothera py may be considered for 
pain pal liation if patients are deriving benefit (such as treatment of known bony 
metastases).  
• Patients experiencing a mixed response requiring local therapy (such as surgery, 
stereotactic radiosurgery, radiotherapy, radiofrequency  ablation) for control of three o r 
fewer lesions may still be eligible to continue study treatment. Patients who receive  local 
therapy directed at a target lesion will no longer be evaluable for radiographic response 
but will remain evaluable for progressi on. Such cases must be discussed with and 
approved by [CONTACT_32816]. 
 
Traditional herbal medicines should not be administered because the ingredients of many herbal 
medicines are not fully studied and their use may result in unanticipated drug -drug interactions 
that may cause or confound assessm ent of toxicity.  
 
Patients who are receiving a RANKL inhibitor (denosumab) prior to enrollment must be willing 
and eligible to receive a bisphosphonate instead while on study; denosumab could potentially 
alter the activity and the safety of atezolizumab.  
 
Initiation or increased dose of granulocyte colony -stimulating factors (such as granulocyte 
colony -stimulating factor, granulocyte/macrophage colony -stimulating factor, and/or 
pegfilgrastim) is prohibited.  
 
Patients are not allowed to receive immunostimula tory agents, including but not limited to IFNα 
or IL -2, during the entire study. These agents, in combination with atezolizumab, could 
potentially increase the risk for autoimmune conditions.  
 
Patients should also not re ceive immunosuppressive medications,  including but not limited to 
cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, methotrexate, and thalidomide. These agents could potentially 
alter the activity and the safety of atezolizumab. Systemic corticosteroids and anti -TNF -α agent s 
may attenuate potential beneficial  immunologic effects of treatment with atezolizumab but may 
be administered at the discretion of the treating physician after consultation with the PI. If 
feasible, alternatives to these agents should be considered. In a ddition, all patients (including

those who discontinue the study early) should not receive other immunostimulatory agents for [ADDRESS_1187764] dose of atezolizumab.  
 
Use of full -dose warfarin will not be allowed during the study. Because bevacizumab has a half - 
life of approximately  21 days, elective major surgery should be delayed whenever possible. No 
data are available to define a safe interval. Re -initiation of bevacizumab following surgery 
requires documented approval f rom the PI.  
 
5.6 Treatment Beyond Disease Progression  
Accumulati ng evidence indicates a minority of subjects treated with immunotherapy may derive 
clinical benefit despi[INVESTIGATOR_228042]. Subjects will be permitted to 
continue treatmen t beyond site investigator assessed progression as long as t hey meet the following 
criteria:  
• Site investigator -assessed clinical benefit  
AND  
• Subject is tolerating study drug(s).  
 
The assessment of clinical benefit should take into account whether the subje ct is clinically 
deteriorating and unlikely to receive furth er benefit from continued treatment. All decisions to 
continue treatment beyond progression should be discussed with the sponsor -investigator and 
documented in the study records.  
 
Subjects should discontinue study therapy upon evidence of further progressi on, defined as an 
additional 10% or greater increase in tumor burden volume from time of initial progression 
(including all target lesions and new measurable lesions).  
 
New lesions are considered measurable at the time of progression if the longest diamete r is at least 
10 mm (except for pathological lymph nodes, which must have a short axis of at least 15 mm). Any 
new lesion considered non -measurable at the time of initial progression may become me asurable 
and therefore included in the tumor burden measurem ent if the longest diameter increases to at 
least 10 mm (except for pathological lymph nodes, which must have an increase in short axis to at 
least 15 mm).  
 
5.7 Criteria for Taking a Participant off P rotocol  Therapy  
Duration of therapy will depend on individua l response, evidence of disease progression and 
tolerance. In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse event(s), treatment may continue 
until one of the following criteria applies:  
 
• Disease  progression.  
 
• Intercurrent illness that prevents further adm inistration of  treatment.  
 
• Unacceptable AE(s) requiring discontinuation of both  agents.  
 
• Participant demonstrates an inability or unwillingness to comply with the  oral 
medication regimen and/or documentation  requirements.

• Evidence of clinical benefit as assessed by [CONTACT_11168]  
 
• Absence of symptoms and signs (including worsening of laboratory values [e.g.,  new 
or worsening hypercalcemia]) indicating unequivocal progression of  disease  
 
• No decline in  KPS  
• Absence of tumor progression at critical anatomical sites (e.g., leptomeningeal 
disease) that cannot be readily managed and stabilized by [CONTACT_990] -allowed medical 
interventions prior to repeat  dosing  
 
• Patients must provide written consent to acknowledge  deferring any standard 
treatment options that may exist in favor of continuing atezolizumab treatment at the 
time of initial  progression.  
 
• Patients who demonstrate co nfirmed radiographic disease progression may be 
considered for continued study treatment at the discretion of the investigator, 
provided they continue to meet all the criteria  above.

6. DOSING DELAYS/DOSE  MODIFICATIONS  
 
Measures will be taken to ensure the safety of patients participating in this trial, including the  use 
of stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria and close monitoring. Eligibility criteria were 
selected to guard the safety of patients in this trial. Safety will be evaluated in this study through 
the monitoring of all serious and non -serious AEs, def ined and graded according to NCI CTCAE 
v4.0. Patients will be assessed for safety (including laborato ry values). General safety 
assessments will include serial interval histories, physical examinations, and specific laboratory 
studies, including serum chem istries and blood counts all serious adverse events (SAEs) and 
protocol -defined events of special int erest will be reported in an expedited fashion. In addition, 
the investigators will review and evaluate observed AEs on a regular basis.  
 
There will be no dose reductions for either atezolizumab or bevacizumab on this study however 
dose delays will be perm itted as detailed below for each agent. The descriptions and grading 
scales found in the revised NCI CTCAE version 4.0 will be utilized for dose delays. A copy of 
the CTCAE version 4.0 can be downloaded from the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program 
(CTEP) web site 
 
 
6.1 Atezolizumab Dose  Modifications  
 
There will be no dose reduction for atezolizuma b in this study. Patients may temporarily suspend 
study treatment for up to 42 days beyond the scheduled date of delayed infusion if study drug - 
related to xicity requiring dose suspension is experienced. The decision to temporarily suspend 
treatment beyond  42 days will be based on a discussion between the treating investigator and 
Sponsor -Investigator. If atezolizumab is held because of AEs for >42 days beyo nd the scheduled 
date of infusion, the patient will be discontinued from atezolizumab and will be fol lowed for 
safety and efficacy as previously defined in Section 5.7. If, in judgment of the treating 
investigator, the patient is likely to derive clinical benefit from resuming atezolizumab after >[ADDRESS_1187767] be tapered off steroids used to treat AEs, atezolizumab may be held for 
additional time beyond 42 days from the scheduled dose until steroids are discontinued or 
reduced to a prednisone dose (or dose equivale nt) of ≤10 mg/day. The acceptable length of 
interruption will be at the discretion of the investigator.  
 
Dose interruptions for reasons other than toxi city, such as surgical procedures, may be allowed. 
The acceptable length of interruption will be at the d iscretion of the Sponsor.  
 
Any toxicities associated or possibly associated with atezolizumab treatment should be managed 
according to standard medical  practice. Additional tests, such as autoimmune serology or 
biopsies, may be used to determine a possible  immunogenic etiology. Although most irAEs 
observed with immunomodulatory agents have been mild and self limiting, such events should 
be recognized ear ly and treated promptly to avoid potential major complications.  
Discontinuation of atezolizumab may not h ave an immediate therapeutic effect, and there is no 
available antidote for atezolizumab. In severe cases, immune related toxicities may be acutely

managed with topi[INVESTIGATOR_11930], systemic corticosteroids, mycophenolate, or TNF -α 
inhibitors.  
 
Patie nts should be assessed clinically (including review of laboratory values) for toxicity prior to, 
during, and after each infusio n. If unmanageable toxicity due to atezolizumab occurs at any time 
during the study, treatment with atezolizumab should be discon tinued.  
 
Management of hepatitis/transaminitis, colitis, rash, and hypothyroidism are presented in this 
section as they have be en observed in this study and are potentially immune related.  
 
Toxicities associated or possibly associated with atezolizumab tre atment should be managed 
according to standard medical practice.  
 
6.1.1 Immune -Related Adverse Event  (irAEs)  
Although most irAEs obse rved with immunomodulatory agents have been mild and self -limiting, 
such events should be recognized early and treated promptly t o avoid potential major 
complications. Discontinuation of atezolizumab may not have an immediate therapeutic effect, 
and there is no available antidote for atezolizumab. In severe cases, immune -related toxicities 
may be acutely managed with topi[INVESTIGATOR_33424], systemic corticosteroids, mycophenolate, 
or TNF -α inhibitors.  
 
The primary approach to Grade 1 to 2 irAEs is supportive and symptomatic care with continued 
treatment with atezolizumab; for higher -grade irAEs, atezolizumab should be withheld and o ral 
and/or parenteral steroids administered. Recurrent Grade 2 irAEs may also mandate withholding 
atezolizumab or the u se of steroids. Assessment of the benefit risk balance should be made by 
[CONTACT_093], with consideration of the totality of informat ion as it pertains to the nature of  the 
toxicity and the degree of clinical benefit a given patient may be experiencing  prior to further 
administration of atezolizumab. Atezolizumab should be permanently discontinued in patients 
with life threatening  irAEs . 
 
6.1.2 Gastrointestinal  Toxicity  
Immune -mediated colitis has been associated with the administration of atezolizumab. 
Patie nts should be advised to inform the investigator if any diarrhea occurs, even if it is mild.  
If the event is of significant duration or m agnitude, or is associated with signs of systemic 
inflammation or acute phase reactants (e.g., increased c -reactive pro tein or platelet count or 
bandemia), it is recommended that sigmoidoscopy (or colonoscopy, if appropriate) with colonic 
biopsy with three  to five specimens for standard paraffin block be performed. If possible, one or 
two biopsy specimens should be snap fr ozen and stored.  
 
Treatment may be restarted following the resolution of colitis. In addition, if the patient is being 
managed with corti costeroids, treatment should not be restarted until the steroids have been 
tapered down to a prednisone dose ≤10 mg/day . Patients who resume treatment should be 
monitored closely for signs of renewed diarrhea. Table 1 provides a summary of dose 
modificatio n guidelines for GI toxicities.

6.1.3 Hepatotoxicity  
Immune -mediated hepatitis has been associated with the administration of atezolizumab.  
 
While in this study, patients presenting with right upp er-quadrant abdominal pain and/or 
unexplained nausea or vomiting should have LFTs performed immediately, and LFTs should be 
reviewed before administration of the next dose of study drug.  
 
If LFTs increase, neoplastic, concurrent medications, viral hepatiti s, and toxic etiologies sho uld 
be considered and addressed, as appropriate. Imaging of the liver, gall bladder, and biliary tree 
should be performed to rule out neoplastic or other causes of increased LFTs. Anti nuclear 
antibody, perinuclear anti -neutrophi l cytoplasmic antibody, ant i-liver kidney microsomal, and 
anti-smooth muscle antibody tests should be performed if an autoimmune etiology is considered. 
Patients with LFT abnormalities should be managed according to the guidelines in Table 2.

reversible posterior leukoencep halopathy syndrome or RPLS. PRES can present w ith following 
signs and symptoms among others: seizures, headache, altered mental status, visual disturbance 
or cortical blindness, with or without associated hypertension. A diagnosis of PRES requires 
confirma tion by [CONTACT_14548]. In patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_14493], treatment of specific symptoms

severity, ranging from free air seen only on the plain abdominal X -ray, which resolved without 
treatment, to  a colonic perforation with abdominal abscess and fatal outcome. The common 
feature among these cases was intra abdominal inflammation, either from gastric ulcer disease, 
tumor necrosis, div erticulitis or chemotherapy -associated colitis. Nevertheless, a ca usal 
association of an intra -abdominal inflammatory process and GI perforation to treatment with 
bevacizumab has not been established. However, caution should be exercised when treating 
patients with intra -abdominal inflammatory process with bevacizumab.

7. ADVERSE EVENTS:  LIST AND REPORTING  REQUIREMENTS  
 
Safety assessments will consist of monitoring and reporting adverse events (AEs) and serious 
adverse events (SAEs)  per protocol. This includes all events of death, and any study specific 
issue of concern. AE monitoring and reporting is a routine part of every clinical trial. Adverse 
events associated with atezolizumab and bevacizumab are detailed in Secti on 2.  
 
7.1 Advers e Events  
An AE is any unfavorable and unintended sign  (including an abnormal laboratory finding) , 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational medicinal product 
(IMP) or other protocol imposed intervention, regardless of att ribution.  
This includes the following:  
− AEs not previously observed in the patient that emerge during the protocol -specified AE 
reporting period, including signs or symptoms associated with Advanced Non -Clear Cell 
Renal Cell C arcinoma  that were not pres ent prior to the AE reporting  period  
− Complications that occur as a result of protocol -mandated interventions (e.g.,  invasive 
procedures such as cardiac  catheterizations)  
− If applicable, AEs that occur prior to assignment of st udy treatment associated with 
medication washout, no treatment run -in, or other protocol -mandated  intervention  
− Pre-existing medical conditions (other than the condition being studied) judged by [CONTACT_853449] -specified AE reporting  period  
 
 
7.2 Serious Adverse  Event  
An AE should be classified as an SAE if the following criteria are met:  
− It results in death (i.e., the AE actually causes or leads to  death)  
− It is life threatening (i.e., the AE, in the view of the investigator, plac es the patient at 
immediate risk of death. It does not include an AE that, had it occurred in a more  severe 
form, might have caused  death.)  
− It requires or prolongs inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
− It results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e ., the AE results in 
substantial disruption of the patient’s ability to conduct normal life  functions)  
− It results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect in a  neonate/infant born to a  mother 
exposed to the  IMP 
− It is considered a significant medical event by [CONTACT_188212] (e.g., may jeopardize the patient or may require medical/surgical intervention  to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed  above)

7.3 Methods and Timing for Assessing and Recording Safety  Variables  
The investigator is resp onsible for ensuring that all AEs and SAEs that are observed or reported 
during the study are collected and reported to the U.S. F ood and Drug Administration (FDA), 
appropriate Institutional Review Boards (IRBs), and Genentech, Inc., in accordance with CFR  
312.32  (Investigational New Drug [IND] Safety  Reports).  
 
7.3.[ADDRESS_1187790] be reported begins after informed consent 
is obtained and initiation of study treatment and ends 30 days following the las t administration of 
study treatment or study discontinuation/termination, whichever is earlier. After this period, 
investigators s hould only report SAEs that are attributed to prior study treatment.  
 
7.3.[ADDRESS_1187791], or other means, will be 
reported appropriately. Each reported AE or SAE will be described by [CONTACT_13662] (i.e., start a nd 
end dates), regulatory seriousness criteria if applicable, suspected relationship to the study drug 
(see following g uidance), and actions taken.  
 
To ensure consistency of AE and SAE causality assessments, investigators should apply the 
following general  guideline:  
− Yes: There is a plausible temporal relationship between the onset of the AE and 
administration of atezolizumab or bevacizumab, and the AE cannot be readily explained 
by [CONTACT_102]’s clinical state, intercurrent illness, or concomitant therapie s; and/or the  AE 
follows a known pattern of response to atezolizumab or bevacizumab  or with similar 
treatments ; and/or the AE abates or resolves upon discontinuation of atezolizumab or 
bevacizumab or dose reduction and, if applicable, reappears upon  re-challenge.  
− No: Evidence exists that the AE has an etiology other than atezolizumab or bevacizum ab 
(e.g., pre existing medical condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, or 
concomitant medication); and/or the AE has no plausible temporal relationship  to 
atezolizumab or bevacizumab administration (e.g., cancer diagnosed [ADDRESS_1187792] 
dose of study  drug).  
 
Expected AEs are those AEs that are listed or characterized in the Package Insert (PI) or current 
Investigator’s Brochure.  
 
Unexpected AEs are t hose not listed in the PI [INVESTIGATOR_570266]’s Brochure or not  identified. 
This include s AEs for which the specificity or severity is not consistent with the description in 
the PI [INVESTIGATOR_168338]’s Brochure. For example, under this definition, hepatic  necrosis would be 
unexpected if the PI [INVESTIGATOR_168338]’s Brochure only referred to elevated  hepatic enzymes or 
hepatitis.  
 
For patients receiving combination therapy, causality will be assessed individually for each 
protocol -mandated therapy.

IRB NUMBER: 15-592
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 04/17/2020
NCI Protocol #: N/A  
DF/HCC Protocol #: 15 -592 
Protocol Version Date: November 4, [ADDRESS_1187793] evaluation time points should be 
adopted.  Examples of non -directive questions include:  
 
• “How have you felt since yo ur last clinical  visit?”  
• “Have you had any new or changed health problems since you were  last 
here?”  
 
Specific Instructions for Recording Adverse Events  
Investigators should use correct medical terminology/concepts when reporting AEs or SAEs. 
Avoid colloqu ialisms and abbreviations.  
 
7.4.1 Diagnosis versus Signs and  Symptoms  
If known at the time of reporting, a diagnosis should be reported rather than individual signs and 
symptoms (e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than jaundice, asterixis, and e levated 
transaminases). However, if a constellation of signs and/ or symptoms cannot be medically 
characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, it is acceptable to report 
the information that is currently available. If a diagnosi s is subsequently established, it should be 
reported as follow -up information.  
 
7.4.2 Deaths  
All deaths that occur during the protocol -specified AE reporting period, regardless of attribution, 
will be reported to the appropriate parties. When recording a death, the event or condition that 
caused or contributed to the fatal ou tcome should be reported as the single medical concept. If 
the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of reporting, report 
“Unexplained Death.”  
 
7.4.3 Pre-existing Medical  Conditions  
A pre -existing medical condition is one that is presen t at the start of the study. Such conditions 
should be reported as medical and surgical history. A pre -existing medical condition should be 
re-assessed throughout the trial and reported as an  AE or SAE only if the frequency, severity, or 
character of the c ondition worsens during the study. When reporting such events, it is important 
to convey the concept that the pre existing condition has changed by [CONTACT_13665] (e.g., “mo re frequent headaches”).

8. PHARMACEUTICAL  INFORMATION  
 
8.1 Atezol izumab      
8.1.1 Description  
Atezolizumab is a human immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 monoclonal antibody consisting of two heavy 
chains (448 amino acids) and two light chains (214 amino acids) and is produced in Chinese 
hamste r ovary cells. Atezolizumab was engineered to  eliminate Fc -effector function via a single 
amino acid substitution (asparagine to alanine) at position 298 on the heavy chain, which results 
in a non -glycosylated antibody that has minimal binding to Fc recept ors and prevents Fc -effector 
function at expe cted concentrations in humans. Atezolizumab targets human programmed death - 
ligand 1 (PD -L1) and inhibits its interaction with its receptor, programmed death -1 (PD -1). 
Atezolizumab also blocks the binding of PD -L1 to B7.1, an interaction that is reported t o provide 
additional inhibitory signals to T cells.  
 
8.1.[ADDRESS_1187808] is provided in a single -use, 20 cc USP/Ph. Eur. Type 1 glass vial 
as a colorless -to-slightly -yellow, sterile, preservative -free clear liquid solution intended for IV 
administration. The vial is designed to deliver 20 mL (1200 mg) of atezolizumab solution but 
may contain more than the stated volume to enable delivery of the en tire [ADDRESS_1187809] is formulated as 60 mg/mL atezolizumab in 20 mM histidine acetate,

8.1.[ADDRESS_1187810] be refrigerated at 2°C -8°C (36°F -46°F) upon receipt u ntil use. Atezolizumab 
vials should not be used beyond the expi[INVESTIGATOR_853432]. No 
preservative is used in the atezolizumab drug product; therefore, each vial is intended for single 
use only. Discard any unused portion of drug left  in a vial. Vial contents should not be frozen or 
shaken and should be protected from direct sunl ight.

9. BIOMARKER, CORRELATIVE, AN D SPECIAL  STUDIES  
 
Correlative studies will be exploratory in nature. In this study, we will evalu ate the 
immunomodulatory properties of atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab and correlate 
findings with outcomes. In addition, we will evaluate tumor tissue and TIMC for expression of 
PD-L1 in mandatory baseline biopsies and progression biopsies (m andatory in patients who have 
a response to treatment as per RECIST 1.1 and then subsequently progress) and correlate with 
outcomes. Lastly, we will evaluate mechanisms of resistance to therapy in progression biopsy 
specimens.  
 
Whole blood for germline DNA  and cfDNA plasma  samples will be analyzed by [CONTACT_853459], such as the Broad Institute, for all patients enrolled on this tr ial. From  
these samples, the data will be submitted to the National Institutes of Health’s Databa se for  
Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP) and other public databases. Samples and data will be de -
identified.  
 
9.1 Blood Studies 
Biomarker  Analysis  
Serum plasma w ill be collected for flow cytometry studies to analyze peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells. Additio nally, plasma will be collected to analyze soluble biomarkers to 
include cytokines /chemokines and angiogenic/growth factors.  
 
For DF/HCC participating sites, 30 mL of blood will be collected as per the Laboratory Manual 
and couriered within 6 hours of collection to The Center of Immunooncology Laboratory.  
 
For non -DF/HCC participating sites, [ADDRESS_1187816]

Whole blood for Germline DNA for tissue will be  collected as per the Laboratory Manual and 
stored until the end of study at which time the sample will be shipped overnight to the Signoretti 
Laboratory.  
 
cfDNA Plasma  
As an exploratory endpoint, plasma will be collected at baseline, every two cycles, and  at the end 
of study for genomic analysis of circulating free DNA (cfDNA).  
 
Blood for cfDNA will be collected as per the Laboratory Manual and shipped at the end of study  
to the Broad Institute.

 9.2 Tissue  Studies  
 
Tissue will be collected to assess the immun omodulatory properties of atezolizumab in 
combination with bevacizumab, assess PD -L1 tumor and TIMC expression, and evaluate 
mechanisms of acquired resistance to therapy.  Mutation profiling will be performed using 
massively parallel sequencing technology ( Oncopanel) and/or whole exome and transcriptome  
sequencing.  
 
Mutational profiling of molecular mechanisms of response and resistance will be analyzed via 
whole exome or w hole genome sequencing and via RNA -sequencing. If fresh tissue is available, 
the speci men will be collected, as stated in this protocol and according to institutional guidelines, 
and put on ice to be transported to the processing laboratory. A portion of f resh tissue will be 
dissociated into a single cell suspension and frozen for future st udies, including single cell 
transc riptome studies and cell line creation.  
 
Archived Tumor Tissue  
Archived tumor tissue will be collected pre -study as per the Laboratory Manual and stored at 
ambient temperature until the end of study at which time the specimens will be shipped to the 
Signoretti Laboratory.  
 
Fresh Tumor Tissue  
Fresh tumor biopsy will be conducted pre -study as per the Laboratory Manual. Fresh tumor 
biopsy ma y be conducted at the end of study on patients who experience a response as per 
RECIST 1.1 and then subsequently progress if medically safe. Frozen specimens should be 
stored at -80°C and specimens fixed in formalin should be stored at 4°C until shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. At the 
end of study, the tumor specimens will be shipped to the Signoretti Laborat ory. 
 
9.3 Radiology Imaging  Studies  
Images of all radiologic assessments at baseline, on study, and at treatment discontinuation with 
corresponding imaging reports for non -DFCI p atients need to be placed on a CD and sent to the 
DFCI for central review of explo ratory imaging response assessment by [CONTACT_19104]. Images and 
reports should be sent on all patients once they discontinue study treatment. Reference the

lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, abdominal masses (not followed by 
[CONTACT_462]), and cystic lesions are all considered non -measurable.  
 
Note: Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiog raphically d efined simple cysts should not be 
considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non -measurable) since they are, by 
[CONTACT_108], simple cysts.

‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable  lesions, 
if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non -cystic lesions are 
present in the same participant, these are preferred for selection as target  lesions.  
 
Target lesions. All measurable lesions up to a maxim um of 2 lesio ns per organ and 5 lesions in 
total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions and recorded 
and measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions 
with the longest d iameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be 
those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements. It may be the case that, on 
occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in whi ch 
circumstan ce the next largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be selected. A 
sum of the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target 
lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum d iameters. If lymph nodes are to be 
included in the sum, then only the short axis is added into the sum. The baseline sum diameters 
will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable 
dimension of the disease.  
 
Non-target l esions . All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable lesions over 
and above the [ADDRESS_1187833] erize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. Imaging -based evaluation is 
preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_460](s) being followed cannot be 
imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461].  
 
Clinical lesi ons. Clinical  lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial 
(e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥10 mm in diameter as assessed using calipers 
(e.g., skin nodules). In the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_853460], including a 
ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
 
Convent ional CT and MRI. This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan based 
on the assumption that CT thickness is 5mm or less. If CT scans have slice thickn ess greater than 
5 mm, the minimum size of a measurable lesion should be twice the slice  thickness. MRI is also 
acceptable in certain situations ( e.g. for body scans).

resolution; however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which g reatly 
impact image quality, lesion conspi[INVESTIGATOR_3934], and measurement. Furthermore, the availability of MRI 
is variable globally. As with CT, if an MRI  is performed, the technical specifications of the 
scanning sequences used should be optimized for the evaluat ion of the type and site of disease.  
Furthermore, as with CT, the modality used at follow -up should be the same as was used at 
baseline and the le sions should be measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence. It is beyond 
the scope of the RECIST guidelines to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all 
scanners, body parts, and diseases. Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used a nd the 
image acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans. Body scans 
should be performed with breath -hold scanning techniques, if possible.  
 
11.1.4  Response  Criteria  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation of Target  Lesions  
Complete Response (CR) : Disappear ance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes 
(whether target or non -target) must have reduction in  short axis to <10 mm.  
 
Partial Response (PR) : At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the base line sum diameters.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) : At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target l esions, 
taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the 
smallest on study). In addition to the relati ve increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an 
absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance  of one or more new lesions is also 
considered progression).  
 
Stable Disease (SD) : Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation of Non -Target  Lesions  
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization of tumor 
marker level.  All lymph node s must be non -pathological in size (<10 mm short axis).  
 
Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) an d/or maintenance of tumor 
marker level above the normal limits.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) : Appearance of one or more new lesions and/o r unequivocal 
progression of existing non -target lesions. Unequivocal progression should not normally trump 
target lesion status. It must be representative of overall disease status change, not a single lesion 
increase. For patients who demonstrate PD at t he first on -treatment imaging assessment, patients 
will be allowed to remain on study until confirmatory imaging at the ne xt imaging assessment at 
the discretion of the treating investigator if it appears that the patients is clinically benefiting 
from tre atment.  
 
Although a clear progression of “non -target” lesions only is exceptional, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_853433]: 15-592

treating physician  should prevail in such circumstances, and the progression status should be 
confirmed at a later time by [CONTACT_463] (or Principal Investigator).  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation of New  Lesions  
The finding of a new lesion should be unequivocal (i.e. not due to difference in scanning 
technique, imaging modality, or findings thought to represent something other than tumor (for 
example, s ome ‘new’ bone lesions may be simply healing or flare of pre -existing lesions).  
However, a lesion identified on a follow -up scan in an anato mical location that was not scanned 
at baseline is considered new and will indicate PD. If a new lesion is equivocal  (because of small 
size etc.), follow -up evaluation will clarify if it truly represents new disease and if PD is 
confirmed, progression shou ld be declared using the date of the initial scan on which the lesion 
was discovered.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation of Best Overall  Response  
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until 
disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest 
measurements recorded since the treatment started). The patient's best response assignment will 
depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

11.1.5  Duration of  Response  
Duration of overall response : The duration of overall response is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that 
recurrent or progressive dis ease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive 
disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started, or death due to any 
cause. Participants without events reported are censored at the last disease evaluation).  
 
Durat ion of overall CR : The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement 
criteria are first met for CR until the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented,

evaluation.  
 
Duration of SD : SD is measured from the start of the treatment until the criteria for progression 
are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started, 
including the baseline measurements.  
 
11.1.6  Immune -Related Response Criteria  (irRC)  
The sum of the products of the two largest perpendicular diameters of lesions (SPD; 5 lesions per 
organ, up to 10 visceral lesions) at tumor assessment using the immune related response criteria 
(irRC)  for progressive disease incorporates the contribution of new measurable lesions (up to 5 
new lesions per organ: 10 new visceral lesions).26 Each net Percentage Change in Tumor Burden 
per assessment using irRC criteria accounts for the size and growth kine tics of both old and new 
lesions as they appear.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Definition of  IndexLesions Response Using  irRC  
• irComplete Response (irCR): Complete disappearance of all target lesions in two 
consecutive observations not less than 4 weeks apart. This category e ncompasses exactly 
the same subjects as “CR” by [CONTACT_853461].  
• irPartial Response (irPR): Decrease, relative to baseline, of 50% or greater in the sum of 
the products of the two largest perpendicular diameters of all target and all new 
measurable lesio ns in two consecutive observations not less than 4 weeks  apart.

(i.e., Percentage Change in Tumor Burden). Note: the appearance of new measurable 
lesions is factored into the overall tumor burden, but does not automatically q ualify as 
progressive disease  until the SPD increases by > 25% when compared to SPD at nadir.  
• irStable Disease (irSD): Does not meet criteria for irCR or irPR, in the absence  of 
progressive  disease.  
• irProgressive Disease (irPD): At least 25% increase in th e percentage change in tumor 
burden (i.e., taking SPD of all target lesions and any new lesions) when compared to SPD 
at nadir, in two consecutive observations at least 4 weeks apart, in the absence of rapid 
clinical  deterioration.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Definition of Non-Index Lesions Response Using  irRC  
• irComplete Response (irCR): Complete disappearance of all non -index lesions. This 
category encompasses exactly the same subjects as “CR” by [CONTACT_853461].  
• irPartial Response (irPR): Non -index lesion(s) are not cons idered in the definition of PR; 
this t erm does not  apply.  
• irStable Disease (irSD): Does not meet the criteria for irCR or  irPD.  
• irProgressive Disease (irPD): Increases in number or size of non -index lesion(s) does  not 
constitute progressive disease unless/ until the Percentage Change in Tumor B urden 
increases by 25% (i.e., the SPD at nadir of the target lesions increases by [CONTACT_453105]).  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Impact of New Lesions on  irRC  
New lesions in and by [CONTACT_242840]. However the ir 
contribution to total tumor burden is included in the SPD which in turn feeds into the irRC 
criteria for tumor response. Therefore, new non -measurable lesions will not discontinue any 
subject from the study.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Definition of Overall Response Using irRC 
Overall response using irRC will be base d on these  criteria:  
• Immune -Related Complete Response (irCR): Complete disappearance of all tumor 
lesions (index and non -index together with no new measurable/unmeasurable lesions)  for 
at least 4 weeks from the date of  documentation of complete  response.  
• Immune -Related Partial Response (irPR): The sum of the products of the two largest 
perpendicular diameters of all index lesions is measured and captured as the SPD 
baseline. At each subsequent tumor assessment, the SPD of the two largest perpendicular 
diame ters of all index lesions and of new measurable lesions are added together to 
provide the Immune Response Sum of Product Diameters (irSPD). A decrease, relative to 
baseline of the irSPD compared to the previous SPD baseline, of 50% or greater is 
considered  an immune Partial Response  (irPR).  
• Immune -Related Stable Disease (irSD): irSD is defined as the failure to meet criteria for 
immune complete response or immune partial response, in the absence of progressive 
disease.  
• Immune -Related Progressive Disease (ir PD): It is recommended to confirm PD by [CONTACT_853462]. Any of the following will constitute progressive  disease:  
− At least 25% increase in the SPD of all target lesions over nadir SPD  calculated

13. STATISTICAL  CONSIDERATIONS  
 
13.1 Study  Design/Endpoints  
This is a multi -center, open -label, single -arm phase II study of the combination of the human 
immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 monoclonal antibody (atezolizumab) with bevacizumab in patients with 
advanced non -clear c ell renal cell carcinoma (nccRCC).  
 
The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of the drug combination.  
 
Primary Endpoints:  
 
− Objective Response Rate: Confirmed CR or PR as best overall response  according 
to RECIST version 1.1 as defined in section 1 1.1.4 by [CONTACT_853463].  
 
Secondary/exploratory Endpoints:  
 
− ORR by [CONTACT_505719] (papi[INVESTIGATOR_1396], sarcomatoid RCC, and other  nccRCC ) 
 
− Duration of  ORR  
 
− Safety and tolerability according to NCI CTCAE version  4.0. 
 
− Immune Related Objective Response Rate as defined according to Immune - 
Related Response Criteria26  and detailed in section  11.1.6.  
 
− PFS defined as the time from trial treatme nt start to the earlier of progression  or 
death due to any cause. Participants alive without disease progression are 
censored at date of last disease  evaluation.  
 
− OS defined as the time from trial treatment start to death due to any cause, or 
censored at d ate last known  alive.  
 
− Quality of life assessments include FKSI -19 and BFI. The FKSI -19 is a 19 item 
questionnaire wi th each item scored on a scale of 0 -4 for a total score of 0 -76 with 
higher scores indicating fewer symptoms (Appendix D).27 The BFI is a 9  item 
questionnaire with each item scored on a scale of 0 -10.28   Scores are categorized 
as mild (1 -3), moderate (4 -6), or severe (7 -10). A global fatigue score can be 
found by [CONTACT_853464] (Appendix  E). 
 
− Immunom odulatory properties: Blood based biomarkers representing 
immunomodulatory properties of combination treatment with atezolizumab and 
bevacizumab at baseline, on treatment and at disease  progression

The null hypothe sis (Ho) of a true objective response rate (ORR) of 6% -10% were seen from 
reported with sunitinib and data of targeted therapy in patients with nccRCC from the IMDC.2,3 
The following table shows that a corresponding alternative hypothesis (Ha) of objective  response 
rate to be detected under the scenario with the adequate statistical power. Sp ecifically, assuming 
a hypothesis test of Ho: ORR=0.1 versus Ha: ORR=0.25 ( bold in table ), there is a 90% 
statistical power with the minimum sample size of [ADDRESS_1187839] with a type I error rate=0.1 and beta (type II er ror =0.1) to assess the efficacy 
(ORR) of the bevacizumab and atezolizumab combination, i.e., if at least 7 responses out of 40 
patients are observed, then the treatmen ts are considered to be efficacious or the null hypothesis 
of 10% ORR is rejected.

The accrual is expected to be 3 patients every month for a duration of 20 months to complete 
enrollment.  
 
As of April 28, 2017, the sample size will be increased from n=40 to 60 patients. The inc reased 
sample size to n=60 patients will allow for better efficacy analysis according to histology 
subtypes. Specifically, an exploratory objective has been added to estimate the ORR according to 
histology subtypes.  
 
Justification of sample size increase:  It is estimated that among the targeted patient 
population, 50% would be pa pi[INVESTIGATOR_31887], 20% would be other nccRCC, and 30% RCC with > 
20% sarcomatoid features.  With the assumed/expected sample size in each histology subtype 
and the targeted ORR rate, the  following table provides the ORR estimate precision (the width  of 
a confide nce interval (CI)) to be achieved based on the unknown targeted ORR rate. The 
precision of ORR estimate uses 80% CI, to be consistent with the original study design, which 
was base d on 90% power for a one -sided type I error of 10% for a hypothesis test of Ho: 
ORR=0.05 vs. Ha:  ORR=0.25.

Demographi c and other baseline characteristics will be summarized for all patients by [CONTACT_853466]. Demographic and baseline characteristics of patients who are replaced will be 
summarized in a separate category. Summari es of continuous demographic/baseline vari ables, 
including age, weight, and vital signs, will be presented as N, mean, standard deviation, median, 
quartiles and minimum and maximum values. For categorical variables, such as histology type, 
the number and p ercentage of patients will be used.  
13.5 Effica cy Analysis 
Primary  Analysis  
Tumor assessment will be performed every 6 weeks (every 2 cycles). At the time of each 
restaging, patients will be classified as achieving complete response (CR), partial response (PR),

stable disease (SD), progr essive disease (PD), or non -evaluable for response according to 
RECIST (Version 1.1) criteria. Objective response will be determined by [CONTACT_853467], whichever 
occurs first. For patients without documented progression or cessation of trial therapy, all 
available response designations will contribute t o the objective response dete rmination. The 
proportion of patients with an objective response will be presented with a two -sided 80% 
confidence interval (CI) using exact binominal method. Based on a sample size of 40 patients, 
the confidence interval will be no wider than 0.22. For th e targeted ORR=25%, the estimated 
ORR precision (two sided 80%CI) would be 0.20.  
 
Secondary Analyses  
Safety and Tolerability: All adverse events recorded during the trial will be summarized for the 
safety population. The incide nce of events that are new or  worsening from the time of first dose 
of treatment will be summarized according to system organ class and/or preferred term, severity 
(based on CTCAE version 4.0 grade), type of adverse event, and relation to study treatment.  
Deaths reportable as SAEs and non -fatal serious adverse events will be listed by [CONTACT_853468], and type of adverse event.  
 
Immune Related Objective Response Rate: The proportion of patients with immune ORR (as 
defined  in section 11.1.6) will be presented with two -sided 90% confidence interval estimated 
using exact binomial methods.  
 
PFS and OS: PFS and OS will each be summarized using the product -limit method of Kaplan - 
Meier. Median times for each endpoint will be pre sented with two -sided 90% confidence 
intervals estimated using log( -log(survival)) methodology. Kaplan -Meier estimates of PFS at 6 
or 12 months after treatment initiation may also be presented with two -sided 90% confidence 
intervals.  
 
Quality of Life Asses sment:  
The quality o f life assessments use the FKSI -1 comprising of 19 items (each has score range 
from 0 to 4) with a possible maximum total score of 76. The BFI is a 9 items questionnaire 
(each score ranging from 0 -10) with possible maximum score of 90. Patients will be ask ed to 
complete FKSI -19 and BFI Forms at baseline (prior to randomization), at every 6 week visits or 
time of treatment termination (only FKSI -19). 
• The estimated differences in quality of life measurements (total scores) between baseline  
(pre-treatment) and  the subsequent timepoints while patients receiving treatment will be 
summarized with 90%  CI. 
• Each of the 19 (FKSI) items will also be summarized descriptively over time as the 
proportion of patients with “clinically significant” sympto ms (those scoring 3 or 4).  Two 
sided 90% CI for the difference in the proportion will also be  assessed.  
• Missing assessments may be due to stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_056], not completing the FKSI or BFI 
assessments, and other reasons. Information on reasons why the pati ent did not  complete  
the FKSI or BFI Form will be  collected.

13.6 Exploratory/Correlative  Analysis  
 
We anticipate that 15 -20% of tumors (of the 40s patients) will not be evaluable for the analyses 
given issue with biopsy/staining/ etc. The evaluable samples f or the analysis will be 32 (80% of 
40 patients).  
 
We anticipate that 15 -20% of tumors (of the 40s patients) will not be evaluable for the analyses 
given issue with biopsy/staining/ etc. The evaluable samples will be 32 (80% of 40 patients).  
 
Tumor infiltra ting lymphocytes (TILs) (biomarkers of immunomodulatory properties)  
 
The relationship between tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and outcomes will be explored 
according to pre -treatment TIL percentages. It is hypothesized that higher levels of lymphocyt ic 
infiltration will be associated with better outcomes. To examine responses according to levels of 
TILs, the evaluable samples will be divided retrospectively according to objective response or 
non-response. Pre -treatment percentages of stromal infiltrat ing lymphocytes will be summarized 
descriptively for the two response groups and compared using Wilcoxon rank -sum tests. Assume 
a targeted ORR of 25% (our primary study alternative hypothesis), if there are 8 responses (25% 
of 32 patients) and [ADDRESS_1187840] with a two -sided, 10% type I 
error will have 88% power to detect a difference in baseline TILs between the two response 
groups that is 1.[ADDRESS_1187841] cancer (LPBC) phenotype or median of the distribution of 
intratumoral or stromal percentages. The LPBC phenotype is defined as 50% or higher 
infiltration (baseline TIL) of either stromal  or intratumoral lymphocytic infiltration. Medians of 
the time -to-event endpoints will be calculated with two -sided 90% confidence intervals 
according to the LPBC groups.  
 
Changes in TILs between baseline and progression/treatment discontinuation will be c alculated 
(post -pre) for each patient and summarized descriptively. In addition, the correlation of TIL 
changes with measures of peripheral blood markers/cytokines (including a panel of markers IL1, 
2, 4, 6, 8, 19, 12, IFN, TNFa, GMCSF) will be explored gr aphically, or by [CONTACT_853469], to assess associations.  
 
PD-L1 Expression Levels  
 
The PD -L1 expression will be evaluated by [CONTACT_853470]. The 
association between pre-treatment PD -L1 expression (percentages) and outcomes will be 
explored. It is hypothesized that higher expression levels of PD -L1 will be associated with poor 
outcomes, due to the fact that upregulation of PD -L1 may allow cancers to evade the immune 
system.  
 
To examine res ponses according to PD -L1 expression, the evaluable samples will be divided 
retrospectively according to objective response or non -response. Pre -treatment  
PD-L1 expression will be summarized descriptively for the two response groups.

of nccRCC patients [ref], the observed PD-L1 positivity is 11% in tumor cell membr ane, and 
56% in TIMC, respectively. The following table displays the detectable differences in PD -L1 
positivity (PD -L1>5%) between the response groups (yes vs. no) with reasonable statistical 
power in TIMC samples , assuming an overall expected % PD -L1+ of 50%-60%, i.e., only large 
differences in % of PD -L1 positivity (56% in responder vs. 6% in non -responders) could be 
detected with 81%  power.

Therefore, no formal inference will be made. The proportion of patients with obj ective response 
according to pre -treatment (baseline) PD -L1 positivity (PD -L1 ≥5% tumor cell membrane 
staining) will be summarized with two -sided 90% exact binomial CI. Kaplan -Meier estimates 
will be used to describe the distribution of PFS according to ba seline PD -L1 expression 
positivity. Medians of time to event endpoints will be shown with two -sided 90% CIs.  
 
Mechanism of Resistance to Therapy  
We will analyze mechanisms of resistance to therapy via serial tumor biopsies (pre -treatment and 
post treatment /progression). Mutation profiling will be performed using massively parallel 
sequencing technology (Oncopanel) and/or whole exome and transcriptome sequencing. The 
sequencing data will be a nalyzed for somatic mutations, insertions and deletions, copy numbe r 
alterations, overexpressed genes, and chimeric transcripts and a complete set of potential driver 
alterations will be compi[INVESTIGATOR_853435].  
 
Changes in the aforementioned mutation measures of resistance between baseline and 
progression/tr eatment discontinuation will be calculated (post -pre) for each patient and 
summarized descriptively. In addition, the correlation among the resistance (marker changes 
post-pre) measures wil l be explored graphically, or by [CONTACT_853471], to potentially assess associations.

Women’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (BWH) responsible for the coordination, development, submission, and 
approval  of a protocol  as well as its subsequent  amendments  per the DFCI  IRB and applicable 
regulatory guidelines (CTEP, Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Office of 
Biotechnology Activities (OBA) etc.). The Lead  Institution is typi[INVESTIGATOR_57910]/HCC Sponsor. The Lead Institution also typi[INVESTIGATOR_853438]/HCC Multi -Center  Protocol.  
 
DF/HCC Sponsor: The person sponsoring the submitted Multi -Center protocol who takes 
respo nsibility  for initiation,  management  and conduct  of the protocol  at all research  locations. 
In applicable protocols,  the DF/HCC Sponsor will serve as the single liaison with any 
regulatory agencies The DF/HCC Sponsor has ultimate authority over the protoco l and is 
responsible  for the conduct  of the study  at DF/HCC  and all Participating  Institutions.  In most 
cases  the DF/HCC  Sponsor  is the same  person  as the DF/HCC  Overall  Principal  Investigator; 
however, both roles can be filled by [CONTACT_853477].  
 
Participating Institution: An institution that is outside the DF/HCC and DF/PCC 
consortium  that is collaborating  with DF/HCC  on a protocol  where  the sponsor  is a DF/HCC 
Investigator. The Participating Institution acknowledges the DF/HCC Sponsor as having  the 
ultimate authority and responsibility for the overall conduct of the  study.  
Coordinating Center: The entity (i.e.  Lead Institution, Medical Monitor, Contract Research 
Organization (CRO), etc) that provides administrative support to the DF/HCC Sponsor in

Health Information (PHI). HIPAA outlines how and under what circumst ances PHI can be 
used or disclosed.  
In order  for covered  entities  to use or disclose  protected  health  information  during  the course 
of a study, the study participant must sign an authorization statement. This authorization 
statement may or may not be separ ate from the informed consent document. The 
Coordinating Center, with the approval from the DFCI IRB will provide a consent  template, 
with information reg arding authorization for the disclosure of protected health  information.  
The DF/HCC Sponsor will use a ll efforts to limit its use of protected health information in 
its trials. However, because of the nature of these trials, certain protected health  inform ation 
must  be collected.  DF/HCC  has chosen  to use authorizations,  signed  by [CONTACT_853480], rather than limited data sets with data use  agreements.  
 
3.6.1     DF/HCC Multi -Center Protocol Confidentiality  
 
All documents, investigative reports, or information relating to the participant are strictly 
confidential. Whenever reasonably feasible, a ny participant specific reports (i.e. Pathology 
Reports,  MRI  Reports,  Operative  Reports,  etc.) submitted  to the Coordinating  Center  should 
be de -identified. It is recommended that the assigned protocol case number (as described 
below)  be used for all participant  specific  documents.  Participant  initials  may be included  or 
retained for cross verification of  identification.  
 
3.7 DF/HCC Multi -Center Protocol Registration  Policy  
3.7.1 Participant Registration and  Randomization  
To register a participant, the following docu ments should be completed by [CONTACT_853481] e-mailed  to the Coordinating  Center  at Dana -Farber  Cancer  Institute 
at or e-mailed  to the DFCI  Clinical  Research  Manager  and Clinical  Research 
Coordinator. Please notify  the DFCI team in advance that a registration packet is to be 
expected with the following  items:  
• Current IRB ap proved informed consent document signed by [CONTACT_163919]. Participant name [CONTACT_143074]. Please ensure the 
participant ’s initials are written on each page of the informed consent  document.

 Other screening  assessments  
The Coordinating Center will review the submitted documents in order to verify eligibility 
and con sent. To complete the registration process, the Coordinating Center will:  
 Register the participant on the study with the DF/HCC Clinical Trial Management 
System  (CTMS).  
 Upon receiving confirmation of registration, the Coordinating Center will inform the 
Participating Institution and provide the study specific participant case nu mber, and,  if 
applicable, assigned treatment and/or dose  level.  
 
Treatment  may not begin  without  confirmation  from  the Coordinating  Center  that the 
participant has been  registered.  
Randomization  can only occur  during  normal  business  hours,  Monday  through  Friday 
from 8:00 AM to 5:[ADDRESS_1187857]  be registered  with the DF/HCC  CTMS  before  the initiation  of treatment  or 
other protocol -specific interventions. Treatment and other protocol -specific interventions 
may not be initiated until the Participating Institution receives confirmation of the 
participant’s registration from the Coordinating Center. The DF/HCC Sponsor and DFCI 
IRB must b e notified of any violations to this  policy . 
3.7.3 Eligibility  Exceptions  
No exceptions to the eligibility requirements for a protocol without DFCI IRB approval  will 
be permitted.  All Participating  Institutions  are required  to fully  comply  with this requirement.  
The process for requesting an eligibility exception is defined  below.  
 
3.8 DF/HCC Protocol Case  Number  
At the time of registration,  the following  identifiers  are required  for all subjects:  initials,  date 
of birth, gender, race and ethnicity. Once eligibility has been established and the participant 
successfully registered, the participant is assigned a unique protocol case number. 
Participating Institutions should submit all de -identified subsequent communication and 
documents to the Coordinating Center, using  this case number to identify  the subject.  
 
3.8.1 Protocol Deviations, Exceptions and  Violations  
Federal Regulations require an IRB to review proposed changes in a research activity to 
ensure that researchers do not initiate changes in approved research without IRB review  and 
approval,  except when  necessary  to eliminate  apparent  immediate  hazards  to the participant. 
DF/HCC requires all departures from the defined procedures set forth in the IRB approved 
protocol to be reported to the DF/HCC Sponsor, who in turn i s responsible for reporting t o 
the DFCI  IRB.

For reporting purposes, DF/HCC uses the terms “violation”, “deviation” and “exception” to 
describe departures from a protocol. All Participating Institutions must adhere to these 
requirements for reporting to the DF/HCC Sponsor and will follow their institutional policy 
for reporting to their local IRB.  
 
3.8.2 Definitions  
Protocol  Deviation:  Any departure  from  the defined  procedures  set forth  in the IRB-approved 
protocol which is prospectively approved prior to its  implementation.  
Protocol Exception: Any protocol deviation that relates to the eligibility criteria, e.g. 
enrollment of a participant who does not meet all inclusion /exclusion criteria.  
Protocol Violation: Any protocol departure that was not prospectively a pproved by [CONTACT_143069].  
3.8.3 Reporting  Procedures  
DF/HCC Sponsor: is responsible for ensuring that clear documentation is available  in the 
medical record and/or regulatory documents to describe all protocol exceptions, devi ations 
and violations. The DF/HCC Sponsor will also be responsible for ensuring that all protocol 
violations/deviations are promptly reported per DFCI IRB guideline s. 
Participating Institutions: Protocol deviations require prospective approval from the DFC I 
IRB. The Participating Institution must submit the deviation request to the Coordinating 
Center who will then submit the deviation request to the DFCI IRB. Upon DFCI IRB 
approval the deviation is submitted to the Participating Institution IRB, per instit utional 
policy. A copy of the Participating Institution’s IRB report and determination will be 
forwarded to the Coordinating Center within [ADDRESS_1187858] be sent to the Coordinating Center in a timely manner. The 
Coordinating  Center  will provide  training  for the requirements  for the reporting  of violations.  
Coordinating Center: Upon receipt of the violation/deviation report from  the Participating 
Institution, the Coordinating Center will submit the report to the DF/HCC Sponsor for 
review. Subsequently, the Partici pating Institution’s IRB violation/deviation report will be 
submitted to the DFCI IRB for review per DFCI IRB reportin g guidelines. DF/HCC will 
forward all violation reports to CTEP via an internal DF/HCC process, as applicable.  
 
3.9 Safety Assessments and Tox icity Monitoring  
The study teams at all participating institutions are responsible for protecting the safety, 
rights a nd well -being of study participants. Recording and reporting of adverse events that 
occur during the course of a study help ensure the con tinuing safety of study participants.  
All participants  receiving  investigational  agents  and/or  other  protocol  mandated  therapy  will 
be evaluated  for safety.  The safety  parameters  include  all laboratory  tests and hematological

reported immediately to the DF/HCC Sponsor via the Coordinating Center.  
Additional safety assessments and toxicity monitoring will be  outlined in the protocol.  
 
3.9.1 Guidelines for Reporting Serious Adverse  Events  
Guidelines for reporting Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) are 
detailed in protocol section 7.  
Participating  Institutions  must  report  the SAEs  to the DF/HCC  Sponsor  and the Coordinating 
Center following the DFCI IRB Adverse Event Rep orting  Policy . 
The Coordinating Center will maintain documentation of all Participating Institution Adverse 
Event reports and be responsible for communicating to all participating investigators, any 
observations reportable under the DFCI IRB Reporting Req uirements. Participating 
Institutions will review and submit to their IRB according to their institut ional policies and 
procedures  
 
3.9.2 Guidelines for Processing IND Safety  Reports  
The DF/HCC Sponsor will review all IND Safety Reports and ensure that all IND S afety 
Reports are distributed to the Participating Institutions. Participating Institutions will 
review/submit to their IRB according to their institutional policies and procedures.  
 
3.10 Data  Management  
DF/HCC  CTRIO  develops  case report  forms  (CRF/eCRFs),  for use with the protocol.  These 
forms are designed to collect data for each study.  DF/HCC CTRIO provides a web based 
training for all eCRF  users.  
 
3.10.1 Data Forms  Review  
Data submissions are monitored for timeliness and completeness of submission. If study 
forms a re received with missing or questionable data, the submitting institution will receive 
a written  or electronic  query  from  the DF/HCC  Office  of Data  Quality,  Coordinating  Center, 
or designee.  
Responses to all queries should be completed and submitted within  14 calendar days.  
Responses may be returned on the written query or on an amended paper case report form, 
or in the case of electronic queries, within the electronic data capture (eDC) system. In the 
case of a written query for data submitted on a paper c ase report form, the query must be 
attached to the specific data being re -submitted in response.  
If study forms are not submitted on schedule, the Participating Institution will periodically 
receive a Missing Form Report from the Coordinating Center noting  the missing forms.

4. REQUISITIONING INVESTIGATIONAL  DRUG  
The ordering of investigational agent is specified in the protocol section 8.  
Participating Institutions should order their own agent regardless of the supplier. (i.e., 
pharmaceutical company.)  
If the agent is commercially available, c heck with the local Director of Pharmacy and/or  the 
Research Pharmacy to ensure that the agent is in stock. If the agent is not stocked, ensure 
that the agent can be ordered once the protocol is approved by [CONTACT_366804]. 
If the agent is investigational, e nsure that the pharmacy will be able to receive and store the 
agent  according  to state and federal  requirements.  The local  IRB should  be kept informed  of 
who will supply the agent (i.e., pharmaceutical company) so that any regulatory 
responsibilities can b e met in a timely  fashion.  
5. MONITORING: QUALITY  CONTROL  
The quality control process for a clinical trial requires verification of protocol compliance 
and data accuracy. The Coordinating Center, with the aid of the DF/HCC  Office of Data 
Quality, provides quality control oversight for the protocol.

monitoring conducted by [CONTACT_221856].  
The Coordinating Center will implement ongoing monitoring activities to ensure that 
Participating Institutions are complying with regulatory and protocol re quirements, data 
quality,  and participant  safety.  Monitoring  practices  may include  but are not limited  to source 
data verification, and review and analysis of eligibility requirements, informed consent 
procedures, adverse events and all associated document ation, review of study drug 
administration/treatment, regulatory files, protocol departures reporting, pharmacy records, 
response assessments, and data  management.  
Site visits will generally occur once a year for sites that are actively enrolling participa nts 
and have part icipants in treatment. Additional monitoring activities may occur if incidences 
of non -compliance are discovered or at the request of the DF/HCC Sponsor. Virtual 
monitoring (source documents are sent to DFCI for review) may be performed in  lieu of a 
site visit if the study  staff and PI [INVESTIGATOR_853439]. 
The decision  to perform  virtual  monitoring  in lieu of a site visit will be based  upon  the site’s 
enrollment,  study  compliance  history,  history  collaborating  with DFCI  on other  multi -center 
studies, and number of participants in active  treatment.  
Monitoring will occur before the clinical phase of the protocol begins and will continue 
during protocol performance through study completion.

Teleconfer ences between DFCI and the participating sites will be conducted on 
approximately a monthly basis. Meeting minutes for teleconferences will be issued to all 
participating sites. Site initiation visits will be conducted via telecon ference. Ongoing 
training  will also be conducted  via teleconference  as needed.  The Coordinating  Center,  Dana 
Farber Cancer Institute will be available to all participating sites for resolving questions, 
concerns and facilitating  compliance.  
 
5.2 Monitoring  Reports  
The DF/HCC  Sponsor  will review  all monitoring  reports  to ensure  protocol  compliance.  The 
DF/HCC  Sponsor  may increase  the monitoring  activities  at Participating  Institutions  that are 
unable to comply with the protocol, DF/HCC Sponsor requ irements or federal and local 
regulation s. 
 
5.3 Accrual  Monitoring  
Prior to extending a protocol to an external site, the DF/HCC Sponsor will establish accrual 
requirements for each participating institution. Accrual will be monitored for each 
participating  institution  by [CONTACT_57954]/HCC  Sponsor  or desig nee. Sites  that are not meeting  their 
accrual expectations may be subject to  termination.  
 
6. AUDITING: QUALITY  ASSURANCE  
Auditing is a method of Quality Assurance and involves the systematic and independent 
examination of all trial related activities and doc uments. Audits determine if evaluated 
activities were appropriately conducted and whether data was generated, recorded and 
analyzed,  and accurately  reported  per the protocol,  applicable  Standar d Operating  Procedures 
(SOPs), and the Code of Federal Regulati ons (CFR).  
 
6.1 DF/HCC Internal  Audits  
All Participating Institutions are subject to audit by [CONTACT_57954]/HCC Office of Data Quality 
(ODQ). Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], approximately [ADDRESS_1187861] partic ipant safety or the integrity of the study are found, 
more participant records may be audited.  
6.2 Audit  Notifications  
It is the Participating Institution’s responsibility to notify the Coordinating Center of all 
scheduled audit dates (internal or NCI) and re -audit dates (if applicable), which involve this 
protocol. All institutions will forward a copy of final audit and/or re -audit reports and 
corrective action plans (if applicable) to t he Coordinating Center, within 12 weeks after the 
audit date.

The DF/HCC Sponsor will review all final audit reports and corrective action plans, if 
applicable. The Coordinating Center, must forward any reports to the DF/HCC ODQ per 
DF/HCC policy for review by [CONTACT_57954]/HCC Audit Committee. For unacceptable audits,  the 
DF/HCC  Audit  Committee  would  forward  the final audit  report  and corrective  action  plan to 
the DFCI IRB as  applicable.  
 
6.4 Participating Institution  Perform ance  
The DF/HCC Sponsor and DFCI IRB is charged with considering the totality of an 
institution’s p erformance in considering institutional participation in the protocol.  
Participating Institutions that fail to meet the performance goals of accrual, submiss ion of 
timely  and accurate  data,  adherence  to protocol  requirements,  and compliance  with state and 
federal  regulations,  may be recommended  for a six-month  probation  period.  Such  institutions 
must  respond  with a corrective  action  plan and must  demonstrate  during  the probation  period 
that deficiencies have been corrected, as evidenced by [CONTACT_853482]. 
Participating  Institutions  that fail to demonstrate  significant  improvement  will be considered 
by [CONTACT_57954]/HCC  Sponsor  for revocation  of participation.  A DF/HCC  Sponsor  and/or  the DFCI 
IRB may terminate a site’s participation if it is deter mined that a site is not fulfilling its 
responsibilities as described  above.

NCCN/FACT Kidney Symptom Index -19 (FKSI -19) 
Scoring Guidelines (Version 4)  
 
 
Instruction s:* 
1. Record answers in "item response" column. If missing, mark with an  X 
2. Perform reversals as indicated, and sum individual items to obtain a  score.  
3. Multiply the sum of the item scores by [CONTACT_941] n umber of items in the subscale, then divide by [CONTACT_853483]. 
This produces the symptom index  score.  
4. As with  all FACIT  questionnaires,  a high score  is good.  Therefore,  a score  of “0” is a severely  symptomatic  patient  and the 
highest possible score is an asymptomatic  patient.  
*For guidelines on handling missing data and scoring options, please refer to the administration and scoring guidelines online at

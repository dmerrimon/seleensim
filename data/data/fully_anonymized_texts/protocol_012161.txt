1.1 Background  
A substantial body of work implicates inflammation as an important contributor to the morbidity and 
mortality associated with end -stage renal disease (ESRD)  and, in particular, to accelerated cardiovascular 
disease.1,2  However, t he etiology of unprovoked inflammation in ESR D is not well understood.  
Proposed etiologic al factors  include chronic sub- clinical infections,3 volume overload,4 oxidative stress,5 
sympathetic activation,6 malnutrition, and  vitamin D deficiency.7  Alter ations  in the intestinal 
microbiome (dysbiosis) are increasingly recognized as potential cause s of inflammation in ESRD 
patients.8-12   
The human gut harbors ~ 1014 bacteria, and the metabolic potential of the gut microbiota is enormous.13-
15  Intestinal  bacteria  perform a m ultitude of functions, and the microbial flora can be  considered a 
metabolically active endogenous “organ. ”  Under physiological conditions, the microbiota provide 
complementary functions by [CONTACT_585262] -digest ible plant polysaccharides,[ADDRESS_769537] greatly increased counts of both aerobic (~106 bacteria/ml) and anaerobic (~107 
bacteria/ml) organisms in the duodenum and  jejunum.[ADDRESS_769538] n otable  changes are reductions  in both the Lactobacillaceae and Prevotellaceae families.9  Hida et 
al. studied the colonic composition of microbiota in healthy controls and hemodialysis patients.22   The 
number of aerobic bacteria such as  Enterobacteria and Enterococci was found to be approximately 100 
times higher in patients treated with maintenance hemodialysis than in controls.  Among anaerobic bacteria, hemodialysis patients had significantly lower organism counts for Bifidobacteria a nd higher 
organism counts for Clostridium perfringens .
22  Vaziri et al. showed significant differences in the 
abundance of 190 microbial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) between the ESRD and the normal control  individuals.  
[ADDRESS_769539] of kidney failure, the investigators examined the gut 
microbiota in nephrectomized rats.9  The study revealed substantially lower “species richness” as 
measured by [CONTACT_585263].  The intestinal 
dysbiosis may be a direct or indirect effect of uremia.23,[ADDRESS_769540] -associated inflammation and cardiovascular disease including 1) increased production of bacteria-
derived solutes (e.g., p -cresol or p -cresyl  sulfate) that are retained in kidney failure ,39-41 and 2)  increased 
translocation into the circulation of bacterial-derived endotoxin across an impaired intestinal 
barrier.10,11,42,[ADDRESS_769541] of responses by [CONTACT_585264]14 receptor.48  Elevation 
in the concentration of soluble CD14 (sCD14), an indicator of CD14 receptor activation, is an 
independent predictor of mortality among patients treated with maintenance hemodialysis.10,[ADDRESS_769542] by [CONTACT_585265] -establishing symbiosis.  Treatment with the prebiotic p -inulin increases 
intestinal growth of beneficial bacteria such as bifidobacteria.49  Increases in bifidobacteria are 
associated with attenuation of inflammation and improvement in intestinal barrier function.50-52  Other 
reported effects of prebiotic supplementation include optimizing the immune response, decreasing 
endotoxin generation, and enhancing metabol ic capabilities.16,53-56 Preliminary evidence indicates that 
prebiotics are effective in reducing the plasma concentration of p-c resyl sulfate in hemodialysis 
patients.57  In a single center, non -randomized, open -label phase I/II study of hemodialysis patients, 
treatment with p -inulin for 4 weeks was accompanied by a reduction in the p -cresyl sulfate generation 
rate and a 20% decrease in its serum concentration.[ADDRESS_769543].  The purpose of the Microbiome and P -Inulin in Hemodialysis Study  is to fill some of 
these gaps in anticipation of ultimately investigating the therapeutic potential of altering the composition and/or function of the gut microbiome in this patient population.  Intensive biosample 
collection from a small number of patient s treated with  hemodialysis before, during, and after 
treatment with p -inulin will be performed in order to generate information about within -participant  and 
between -participant  variability in the composition and metabolic products  of the gut microbiome.  The 
study will also provide information about the tolerability and safety of p -inulin and the feasibility of 
biosample collection.  
1.2 Study  Agent   
p-Inulin (oligofructose -enriched inulin) is a prebioti c.  Inulin -type prebiotics are members of a larger 
group of compounds called “fructans ,” which encompasses all naturally occurring plant oligo - and poly -
saccharides in which one or more fructosyl-fructose linkages comprise the majority of glycosidic bonds.   
Inulin is present in vegetables with high fiber content such as sugar beets, leeks, onions, garlic and

break down the long chain inulin to the short chain oligofructose in 95% pure form.  Short -chain 
oligofructose is mixed with inulin in equal parts to prepare the final product, p -inulin.59   This 
composition allows the short chain oligofructose to be fermented in the proximal (right) colon and the 
long chain molecule, inulin, to be fermented in the distal colon.60  The end produ cts of fermentation are 
gases (such as carbon dioxide and hydrogen), lactate, and short -chain fatty acids.   
Preliminary evidence in individuals with preserved kidney function indicates that p -inulin promotes 
growth of bifidobacteria, reduces endotoxin generation, attenuates inflammation, decreases generation 
of uremic toxins and improves metabolic function.12,49,61,62   
Inulin -type prebiotics received the designation of “generally recognized as safe” in 1992.[ADDRESS_769544] of prebiotics in  a variety of 
conditions including obesity,64,65 HIV infection66,67 and gastrointestinal diseases.68  Bouhnik et al . showed 
that four weeks of treatment with short- chain fructo -oligosaccharides increases fecal bifidobacteria 
counts .69  In a small, randomized double -blind, placebo -controlled trial, 31 participant s who had 
received radiotherapy were randomized either to p -inulin or maltodextrin -containing placebo  for 4 
weeks.70  Lactobacillus and bifidobacterium counts decreased with radiotherapy and  recovered in the 
active treatment group  but not in the placebo group .  In another study, 49 individuals  with diabetes 
were randomized to  treatment with either  inulin 10 g/day or a maltodextrin -containing placebo  for [ADDRESS_769545]  (Table 1 ).  In a pi[INVESTIGATOR_369518] 22 patients  receiving maintenance hemodialysis , treatment with 2 0 g of p -inulin for 4 weeks 
reduced the generation and serum concentration of p- cresol.58  The authors reported that  
p-inuli n was well tolerated and that there was excellent adherence with treatment.  Nakabayashi 
showed that symbiotic treatment (Lactobacillus casei Shirota strain and Bifidobacterium breve Yakult 
strain as probiotics and galacto - ligosaccharides as prebiotics) t hree times per day for 2 weeks reduced 
p-cresol levels  in maintenance hemodialysis .57

1.4 Dose Rationale and Risk/Benefits  
A dose -dependent bifidogenic effect has been observed with p -inulin.49,[ADDRESS_769546] of 8 weeks treatment with short- chain fructo -oligosaccharides (SC- FOS).62  Forty 
healthy volunteers  were randomized to one of five groups: G 0 group (SC -FOS 0 g and saccharose 20 g) 
used as placebo; G 2.5 group (SC -FOS 2.5 g and saccharose 17.5 g); G5 group (SC -FOS 5 g and sacchar ose 
15 g); G 10 group (SC -FOS 10 g and saccharose 10 g); and G 20 group (SC -FOS 20 g and saccharose 0 g).  
Bifidobacteria counts at Day 8 were greater in groups G 10 and G 20 compared with G 0 and G 2.5.  Total 
anaerobes increased at the 10  g daily dose, but not  at lower doses, while no significant differences were 
found for Bacteroides, Lactobacillus, or Enterobacteriaceae.76  Excess flatus was significantly more 
frequent in participants consuming G 20.  Th e authors concluded that for healthy individuals consuming 
their usual diets, 10 g/day is the optimal dose in terms of tolerability and efficacy with respect to 
increasing fecal bifidobacteria.  Gibson et al . reported that FOS at 15 g/day in three divided doses 
increased the proportion of Bifidobacteria from 6% to 22% in healthy adults during two weeks of use.  
The effect on Bifidobacteria was accompanied by [CONTACT_585266], Clostridia, and 
Fusobacteria.49  Meijers et al. showed that a dose of 20 g/day is tolerated by [CONTACT_585267];  
however, report s of abdominal symptoms  were frequent .[ADDRESS_769547]  patients  in the absence of p -inulin 
treatment.  P articipants are not expected to benefit from participating in th is study .  The d ata obtained 
from this study will be used to inform  the design of a larger, placebo -controlled  study to assess the 
therapeutic potential of altering the gut microbiome with p -inulin in hemodialysis patients.   
2 Study Objectives  
The overarching hypothesis motivating this exploratory study of variability of the human gut 
microbiome is that treatment with oligofructose enriched inulin (p- inulin) will alter the composition 
and/or function of the gut microbiome, and thereby [CONTACT_585268] -derived uremic toxins, 
improve gut barrier function and attenuate systemic inflammation in patients treated with maintenance 
hemodialysis .  In order to design a future clinical trial to te st this hypothesis, information is needed 
about t he following parameters from individuals  receiving maintenance  hemodialysis:  
1) Intra -participant  and inter -participant  variability in the metabolic products and composition of 
the gut microbiome  
2) Impact of p -inulin on the metabolic products  and composition of the gut microbiome  
3) Tolerability of p- inulin  
4) Safety of p -inulin  
5) Feasibility of collecting stool samples in this patient population  
2.1 Primary  Objectives  
• To evaluate the within -participant  variability of gut bacteria- derived metabolites and gut 
bacterial composition over an 8 -week period during which there is no protocol -driven treatment  
• To evaluate, using each participant  as  his/her own control, whether treatment with p -inulin for 
12 week s alters gut bacteria- derived metabolites and gut bacterial composition  
2.2 Secondary  Objectives  
• To evaluate, using each participant  as his/her own control, whether p -inulin alters levels of 
selected circulating inflammatory markers and mediators  
• To assess between -participant  variability of gut bacteria- derived metabolites and gut bacterial 
composition over an 8 -week period during which there is no protocol -driven treatment  
• To assess between -participant  variability of gut bacteria- derived metabolites and gut bacterial 
composition during a 12-week period of treatment with p -inulin  
• To evaluate the tolerability of p- inulin administered at a total daily dose of 16 g 
• To evaluat e the short -term safety of p -inulin administered at a total daily dose of 16 g  
• To assess adherence to p -inulin treatment

study participants.   
Dialysis unit laboratory studie s, medical records at the investigator’s institution, and treatment or 
medical history records at the dialysis  unit will be reviewed to assess eligibility for enrollment.  No study -
specific testing is required to confirm eligibility, other than a  serum pregnancy test for women of 
childbearing potential.  Before  approaching potential participants , the treating nephr ologis t will be 
contact[CONTACT_93492].  
Once preliminary eligibility is confirmed, written informed consent will be obtained by a qualified 
investigator or study site designee during an in -person visit.  This visit ma y take place either at the local 
dialysis unit or at the investigator’s institution  in accordance with investigator and participant 
preferences.   
Recruitment will continue until a total of [ADDRESS_769551] 20  weeks 
of the study protocol.   
Participants will be compensated for providing stool samples.  Each Clinical Center is responsible for 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a compensation plan and schedule, and distributing payment.   
4.4 Early Withdrawal of Participants  and Early Study Termina tion  
4.4.1 Early Withdrawal of Participants  
Reasons for premature withdrawal include  pregnancy, death, and withdraw al of consent.  Participants 
who are not able or willing to continue taking the study agent will be encouraged to remain in the study 
and continue biosample collection.   
4.4.2 Dose Reduction and Discontinuation of p-I nulin  
Participants who are unable to tolerate  p-inulin at  a total dose of 1 6 g per day ( 8 g twice daily) will have 
the dose reduced to a total dose of 8 g per day ( 4 g twice daily) .  If the participant is unable to tolerate  a 
total daily dose of [ADDRESS_769552] the patient.     
5.1.2 Screening/Baseline Visit  
Patients  who appear  eligible based on pre -screening will be approached in person to determine inter est 
in participation  and confirm eligibility.  S tudy personnel will discuss the study goals and procedures with 
the potential participant in detail.  If the patient agrees  to participat e in the study, study personnel will 
review and assess understanding of  the entire informed consent form before  obtaining written informed 
consent from the participant.  The consenting process will be performed by a qualified investigator or 
study site designee.  Informed consent will be obtained and documented before any study procedures are performed.  
The screening and baseline activities  may take place over a single or multiple  visits.   
Screening/Baseline Visit Activities  
• Informed consent process  
• Collection of baseline data including demographic s, medical history, and medication use 
including recent and current use of prescription  products , over -the-counter products, herbal 
supplements,  vitamins, and prebiotic  and probiotic use in any form.  In addition, medical records 
from the dialysis facility  will be reviewed  to capture any non -reported data on recent 
medication use.  
• Determination of eligibility  
• Blood draw  for baseline measurements ( 13 mL); blood draw must be performed before the  start 
of the dialysis session  
• Blood draw  for serum pregnancy t est for women of childbearing potential   
• Instruction in stool sample collection  and storage  
• Dietary assessment using food frequency questionnaire  
• Gastrointestinal symptom assessment questionnaire  
Enrolled participants will be instructed not to change their dietary pattern s, if possible, during the study.   
See Section 5.[ADDRESS_769553] visit.  On a weekly basis, participants will be queried on antibiotic use 
in the previous week, and dialysis records will be reviewed for antibiotics administered at the dialysis unit.  During the dosing phase, participants will also be asked questions to assess adherence with  
p-inulin.

5.2 Biosample Collection Procedures and Schedule  
Stool samples will be collected at baseline , once weekly during weeks 1–7, 10–18 and 21-28, and twice  
weekly during weeks 8, 9, 19, and 20.   The sample collection during weeks 21-28 (after p -inulin 
treatme nt) will allow detection of delayed alterations in response to p -inulin and will provide 
information about the durability of p -inulin effects . 
Stool specimen s will be obtained  by [CONTACT_19288].  Participants will be provided a commercial 
“toilet hat” stool specimen collection kit (specimen container, shippi[INVESTIGATOR_3858], S tyrofoam cooler, and cold 
packs; Fisherbrand Commode Specimen Collection System; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, 
[LOCATION_003]) , sample aliquot tubes, and gloves  at the  Baseline  visit and as needed for resampling.  Participants 
will be instructed on how to aliquot and store samples  before bringing them to the research team .   
Participants will bring the aliquoted stool samples on ice packs in the  closed Styrofoam cooler to the 
clinical center or dialysis unit.  Research staff will process samples according to C ore Laboratory  
specifications and store at -80 °C for future shipment to the Core Laboratory.   The aliquoting of samples 
is performed before  freezing in order to mi nimize the number of freeze -thaw cycles.   Detailed 
information regarding  stool sample collection, storage, shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and participant training is provided in 
the Manual of Procedures (MOP).   
Participants who do not provide the required number of stool samp les will continue to be followed for 
the full duration of the study and will continue to be encouraged to provide samples in accordance with 
the protocol schedule.  
All b lood samples will be obtained on dialysis days before  the start of the dialysis session  and before any 
interaction between the blood and the dialyzer membrane .  The volume of each  sample will be [ADDRESS_769554].  If this result is less than 9.0 g/dl, b lood will not be collected until  the hemoglobin value is 9.0 g/dl  or greater.

which is run using electron impact as the ionization source.  Similar to the LC -based platform, detection 
of the metabolite would involve detection of its precursor followed by [CONTACT_585270] t ions for the precursor by [CONTACT_585271].  Each of the controls (standard mixture and liver 
pool) will be included multiple times in the randomization scheme such that sample preparation and 
analytical variability are constantly monitored. Furthermore, analysis of each clinical sample will be 
followed by [CONTACT_585272].  
The bacterial genomic DNA from feces will be extracted using MO BIO PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit (MO 
BIO Laboratories). DNA extraction and 16S rRNA gene sequencing will be performed with methods 
consistent with those developed for the NIH -Human Microbiome Project. Briefly, the microbiome will be 
measured by [CONTACT_585273] 16S rRNA genes on the Illumina MiSeq platform. 16S rRNA genes 
contained in every sample will be isolated by [CONTACT_585274] 16S rRNA genes with 
barcoded, degenerate primers that target the V4 hy pervariable domain of the gene.  These primers also 
contain adapters for MiSeq sequencing so that the PCR products may be pooled and sequenced directly. 
Pooling will enable us to achieve a depth of sequencing of at least 5,000 reads per sample.  Rarefaction 
and collector’s curves of microbial community d ata will be constructed using sequence data for each 
sample to ensure that we are sampling the majority of the diversity present.  
 A purposeful approach to analyzing the stored blood and stool samples will be used.  Initial 
measurements will be made on stool and blood samples obtained from  a subset of the time points . 
Selection of  additional time points for sample  analysis will be made based  on the  initial findings.  For 
example, if measurements made on samples obtained at weeks [ADDRESS_769556] low priority.  However, if within- participant  variability is evident 
using the samples from weeks  1, 4 and 8, performing measurements on the weekly samples , and/or the 
within -week samples  will be of greater interest .

the results.  
7.3 Statistical Methods  
7.3.1 Sequence Data Processing  
Longitudinal stool samples will be analyzed by [CONTACT_585279] 16S rRNA gene tags to characterize bacterial populations.   Sequence data will be processed using QIIME, augmented by [CONTACT_941] R package 
QIIMER (http://cran.r -project.org/web/packages/qiimer).   Taxonomy will be assigned to the sequences 
using Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) for 16S, augmented by [CONTACT_585280]. The 16S t ag sequences will be collected into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) with 97% 
sequence identity and samples summarized as vectors of proportions.   

HD Microbiome Study   [ADDRESS_769563] 8 weeks, and during the p -inulin treatment period will be 
assessed at both the microbial diversity level, and the individual taxon level.   The analysis will be 
performed at the overall microbiome composition level by [CONTACT_585281].   Principal coordinate analysis (PCA) based on the UniFrac distances will be 
performed and used to display the samples in PCA space.  
For each individual, the alpha- diversity of bacterial genera will be calculated at each time point.  Alpha-
diversity is used to describe the structure of the bacterial community based on the number of species, and the proportion in which each species is represented in the commun ity.  The alpha diversity as a 
measurement will be analyzed using the repeated measurement ANOVA .  To measure inter -individual 
variability, the beta diversity will be calculated to measure the compositional dissimilarity between two individuals at a given time point.  To account for the phylogenetic tree information of the bacterial taxa, UniFrac distances (both weighted and unweighted) will be used as the beta diversity measure.  Within -
individual distances and between -individual distances will be compared  and clustering analysis of all the 
samples will be performed using the UniFrac distances.   A repeated measure distance-based MANOVA 
will be used to assess the changes of the overall microbial compositions over time.  The i ntraclass 
correlation coefficient will be determined using mixed models, with the individual as the cluster and 
multiple diversity observations as groups.   The beta diversity will be applied with PREMANOVA and 
kernel -based regression in order to test the overall microbiome compositional differences between 
groups and over times.   The genus -level analysis will be analyzed using rank -based tests using false 
discovery rate (FDR) control procedure s for multiple comparisons to identify the bacterial genera that 
change their abundances over time and show different profiles between treatment/control 
periods.   Linear mixed -effect models will also be explored after appropriate transformation of the 
proportional data (e.g., logistic transformation).  In addition to  evaluating the intra- individual  and inter -
individual  variability at the overall microbial compositional level, such variability will be evaluated at the 
taxon level, e.g., at each genus level.   From 16S data, estimates will be obtained of the relative 
proportion of each of the bacterial genera observed in the data.  For each bacterial taxon, a zero 
enriched beta regression model will be fit with random effects to assess the intra -individual  and inter -
individual  variability, both in terms  of presence/absence and  also the relative abundances.  
The effects of p -inulin on gut microbiome compositions  will be assessed  using repeated measurements 
ANOVA with alpha -diversity as the outcome.   This assesses whether p -inulin has any effect on the 
overall gut microbial diversity.  The  distance -based MANOVA  will be applied  to test the effect of p -inulin 
on overall microbial compositions, where UniFrac distances will be used.  To identify the bacterial taxa 
that show differential abundances before and after p -inulin treatment, a zero -enriched beta regression 
model will be fit with random effects to take into account week -to-week variability.  Similar analyses will 
be performed to compare the microbiome compositions between week [ADDRESS_769564] 
models will be applied to study change of metabolites before and after p -inulin treatment and to 
identify the metabolites that change after p -inulin treatment.  Adjustment for multiple comparisons will 
be conducted within the framework outlined by [CONTACT_585282] (FDR).83 
7.3.4 Association between microbiome composition and metabolites  
Association s between microbiome and metabolites will be explored through  correlation analysis and 
clustering analysis, focusing on the metabolites and microbial taxa that change over the study periods.  Repeated measurement regression analysis of metabolite with time -varying covariates (microbiome 
diversity or microbial genera) will be used to identify the microbial genera that are associated with 
changes of metabolites due to p -inulin treatment.  
7.3.[ADDRESS_769565] descriptive statistics will be used to summarize adverse events during the three phases (pre -
treatment, p -inulin treatment, and post -treatment)  and graphical methods including stem -and-leaf 
diagrams will be used to examine distributions of adverse events.  F requencies will be compared 
between the treatment and non -treatment phases for the total number of events, number of 
participants  experiencing events, events within body system categories (e.g., gastrointestinal system 
events), and events within severity categories.

resolution.   
9.1.1 Quality Control  Activities  
The Quality Control Committee and the DCC will develop a quality assurance and control plan that 
ensures that study data are as precise and reliable as possible.  
Manual of Procedures  (MOP) – The MOP will describe the sequence of study conduct and provide 
detailed instruction for the performance of screening, baseline, enrollment, treatment allocation and follow -up procedures.  The MOP will provide instruction in case report form (CRF) completion, use of the 
electronic DMS , and collection, documentation and  transfer of specimens and tests to central 
laboratories.  
Training and certification procedures  – The DCC will conduct a training session before the study starts to 
train and certify personnel in the performance of study procedures.  
Site visits  – Site visits will be conducted as outlined in the Study Monitoring Plan.  Findings from site 
visits will be used to resolve problems and develop corrective action plans.  
External data sources  – The DCC will monitor quality control of data received from central laboratories .   
Internal quality control procedures  – A data validation plan, rule set specifications, and programming 
logic to implement data validation rules will be implemented.  
9.1.[ADDRESS_769572] enrollment,  tracking, quality review, and safety monitoring 
reports.  Adverse event reports, DSMB reports and reports for statistical analysis will be developed and 
produced on an appropriate schedule.  
9.2 Data  Security  
The DMS will be designed to prevent unauthorized a ccess to study  data and to prevent data loss due to 
equipment failure or catastrophic events. The procedures to do so encompass user account management, user privilege assignment, data loss prevention (database backup), and DMS change 
management.  User acc ess will be controlled by [CONTACT_585284].

Version  V2.0, September 9, 2015  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  
Do not disclose or use except as authorized by [CONTACT_93485][INVESTIGATOR_93463].  Study data collected at the Clinical Centers will be entered into Oracle Clinical.  This DMS  uses a secure 
connection between the client browser at the Clinical Center and the we b server at the DCC.  Data 
transmitted over this connection is authenticated by [CONTACT_585285].  
Where applicable , electronic files containing data from hand held devices  and central laboratories  will 
be transferred to the DCC using secure File Transfer Protocol ( FTP) technology.  The DCC team will 
maintain a secure FTP server.  The files transmitted using this method will be encrypted during the 
exchange.  
9.2.[ADDRESS_769573] of 1996 (HIPAA).  Those regulations require a signed participant  authorization informing the  participant  of the following:  
• What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from participants  in this study  
• Who will have access to that information and why  
• Who will use or disclose that information  
• The rights of a research participant  to rev oke their authorization for use of their PHI.  
In the event that a participant  revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by 
[CONTACT_5151], retains the ability to use all information collected before  the revocation of participant  
authoriza tion.  For participants  that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts should 
be made to obtain permission to collect at least vital status (i.e. that the participant  is alive) at the end 
of their scheduled study period.  
9.3 Source  Documents  
Source data is all information, original records of clinical findings, observations, or other activities in a 
research study  necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the study .  Source data are contained 
in source documents.  Examples of these original documents, and data records include: dialysis unit 
records, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical and office charts, laboratory reports , memoranda, participant  diaries 
or evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instrumen ts, 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_10379], microfiches, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, x -rays, participant  files, and records kept at the 
pharmacy, at the laboratories, and at medico -tech nical departments involved in the clinical trial.  
9.3.1 Case Report  Forms 
The study CRF is the primary data collection instrument for the study.  All data requested on the CRF will 
be recorded.  All missing data will be explained.  “N/D” will be used to indicate  on the CRF that a 
procedure was not done or a question was not asked  rather than leaving a space blank.   “N/A” will be 
used to indicate that an item is not applicable to the individual case.   All entries will be printed legibly in 
black ink.  If any entry  error has been made, to correct such an error, a single straight line will be drawn 
through the incorrect entry and the correct data will be entered above it.  All such changes will be

10 Study Monitoring, Auditing, and Inspecting  
10.1 Study Monitoring Plan  
A monitoring plan that may include formal visits to the Clinical Centers by [CONTACT_93513] 
(DCC, Clinical Center investigators  and study coordinators, and NIDDK representatives) will be dev eloped 
by [CONTACT_93514].   Clinical Center investigators will allocate adequate time for 
such monitoring activities.  The Principal I nvestiga tor will also ensure that the monitor and  other 
compliance or quality assurance reviewers are given access to study -related documents and study -
related facilities (e.g. pharmacy, diagnostic laboratory, etc.), and have  adequate space to conduct the 
monitori ng visit.  
10.2 Auditing and Inspecting 
The DCC and Clinical Center investigator s will permit study -related monitoring, audits, and inspections 
by [CONTACT_1201], the NIH , government regulatory bodies, and University compliance and quality assurance 
groups of all study  related documents (e.g. source documents, regulatory documents, data collection 
instruments, study data etc.).  The DCC and Clinical Center investigators will ensure the capability for 
inspections of applicable study -related facilities (e.g. pharmacy, diagnostic laboratory, etc.).

[ADDRESS_769582] (DSMB) Charter  
Hemo dialysis  Novel Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_93480] (DSMB) will act in an advisory capacity to the National Institute of 
Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) to monitor patient safety and evaluate the efficacy of 
the interventions.  The H emodialysis  Novel Ther api[INVESTIGATOR_93463] – Gut Microbiome and p -Inulin in 
Hemodialysis  study  is funded by [CONTACT_49010].  
 DSMB RESPONSIBILITIES  
 The initial responsibility of the DSMB will be to review the study protocols, consent documents and plans for data safety monitoring, and approve the initiation of these clinical trials. After this approval, and at periodic intervals during the course of the trials, the DSMB responsibilities are to:  
• review and approve major changes in the research protocol, informed consent documents and plans for data safety and monitoring, including all proposed revisions;  
• evaluate the progress of the trial, including periodic assessments of data quality and timeliness, participant recruitment, accrual and retention, participant risk versus benefit, performance of the trial sites, and other factors that may affect study outcome;  
• consider factors external to the study when relevant information becomes available, such as scientific or therapeutic developments that may have an impact on the safety of the pa rticipants 
or the ethics of the trial;  
• protect the safety of the study participants;  
• report on the safety and progress of the trial;  
• make recommendations to the NIDDK, the Steering Committee and, if required, to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Institution Review Boards (IRBs) concerning continuation, termination or other modifications of the trial based on the observed beneficial or adverse effects of the treatment under study;  
• if appropriate, conduct interim analysis of efficacy in accordance with stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_585260];  
• ensure the confidentiality of the trial data and the results of monitoring;  
• assist the NIDDK by [CONTACT_585290], enrollment, sample 
size, and/or data collection.  
 
MEMBERSHIP  
 
The DSMB will consist of at least eight members. Five participating members will constitute a quorum. The members have been appointed by [CONTACT_49010]. Members of the DSMB shall have no financial, scientific, or other conflict of interest with the studies. Collaborators or associates of the investigators in this trial are not eligible to serve on the DSMB. Written documentation attesting to absence of conflict of interest is required.  
  [CONTACT_93536] of University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_93482]. He is responsible for overseeing the meetings 
and developi[INVESTIGATOR_93483], [CONTACT_93537] and [CONTACT_93538].  [CONTACT_585297]  will serve as the DSMB Executive Secretary.  The Chairperson is the contact

CONFIDENTIAL  
Do not disclose or use except as authorized by [CONTACT_93485][INVESTIGATOR_93463].  person for the DSMB.  Other NIDDK official (s) or NIDDK appointee (s) may serve as an ex -officio member 
(s) of the DSMB.  The DCC, University of Pennsylvania, shall provide the logistical management for the 
DSMB, in coordination with NIDDK ([CONTACT_93540], as point of contact). Whenever possible, [CONTACT_585298], Director of the Division of Kidney, Urology and Hematology of NIDDK will also attend meetings.  
 
BOARD PROCESS  
 
The DSM B will meet a minimum of once a year at the call of the Chair, with advance approval of the 
NIDDK Program Director.  An NIDDK representative will be present at every meeting.   Meetings shall be closed to the public because discussions may address confiden tial patient data. 
Meetings are attended, when appropriate, by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_296866]/her  staff.  
Meetings may be convened as conference calls/webinars as well as in person. An emergency meeting of the DSMB may be called at any time by [CONTACT_585292]. The DSMB Chairperson should contact [CONTACT_585293].  
 
MEETING FORMAT  
 An appropriate format for DSMB meetings consists of open, closed and executive sessions. This format 
may be modified as needed. A brief closed and/or an executive session will usually be held before the open session.  
 
Open Session: 
 
The members of the DSMB, the NIDDK staff, the steering committee, inclu ding the study biostatistician 
will attend the open session.  Issues discussed will include the conduct and progress of the study, 
including patient recruitment, data quality, general adherence and toxicity issues, compliance with protocol, and any other l ogistical matters that may affect either the conduct or outcome of the study.  
Protocol amendments may also be presented in this session.  
 
Closed Session: 
 The closed session will be attended by [CONTACT_93526], representatives from the NIDDK, or its appointees, and the study biostatistician. The discussion at the closed session is completely 
confidential.  
 
Analyses of blinded outcome data are reviewed by [CONTACT_93527], including baseline 
characteristics, primary and secondary outcomes, adv erse events, adherence and dropouts, and 
examination of any relevant subgroups. However, the DSMB may request unmasking of the data for either safety or efficacy concerns.   
 
Executive Session:  
 The executive session will be attended by [CONTACT_93526], and the NIDDK Staff, or its appointees.  
 The DSMB will discuss information presented to it during the closed and open sessions and decide whether to recommend continuation or termination, protocol modification or other changes to the 
HD Microbiome Study   [ADDRESS_769583] of the study in the Executive Session.  The DSMB can become unblinded if trends develop either 
for benefit or harm to the participants.  
 Should the DSMB decide to issue a termination recommendation, a full vote of the DSMB will be required. In the  event of a split vote, majority vote will rule and a minority report should be appended.  
Reasons for early termination may include:  
• Serious adverse effects in the entire intervention group or in a dominating subgroup; 
• Greater than expected beneficial eff ects;  
• A statistically significant difference by [CONTACT_93528]; 
• Logistical or data quality problems so severe that correction is not feasible.  
 
Final Open Session (optional): 
 The final session may be attended by [CONTACT_93526], st eering committee members, the study 
biostatistician or other study members, and the NIDDK staff.  
 The Chairperson of the DSMB or the NIDDK Staff shall report on the recommendations of the DSMB regarding study continuation and concerns regarding the conduct  of the study.  Requests regarding data 
presentation for subsequent meetings will be made.  Scheduling of the next DSMB meeting may be discussed.  
 REPORTS  
 Interim Reports : Interim reports will be prepared by [CONTACT_36909], located at the 
University of Pennsylvania.  The reports will be distributed to the DSMB and the NIDDK Program Director at least [ADDRESS_769584] of two 
parts : 
 Part 1 ( Open Session Report ) provides information on study aspects such as accrual, baseline 
characteristics, and other general information on study status.  This report is generally shared with all investigators involved with the clinical trial.  The reports contained in this section may include:  
o Comparison of Target Enrollment to Actual Enrollment by [CONTACT_43380]  
o Comparison of Target Enrollment to Actual Enrollment by [CONTACT_93529]  
o Overall Subject Status by [CONTACT_93529], including: Subjects Screened, Enrolled, Active, Completed and Terminated  
o Demographic and Key Baseline Characteristics by [CONTACT_26374]  
o Treatment Duration for Subjects who Discontinue Therapy  
o Adverse Events/Serious Adverse Events by [CONTACT_93530] 2 ( Closed Session Report ) may contain data on study outcomes, including safety data, including 
serious adverse events or termination.  Data will be presented by [CONTACT_93531]; however, 
the DSMB may request that the treatment groups be unmasked  to ensure that there are no untoward 
treatment effects. Thi s report should not be viewed by [CONTACT_585294].

Version  V2.0, September 9, 2015  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  
Do not disclose or use except as authorized by [CONTACT_93485][INVESTIGATOR_93463].  Reports from the DSMB:  A formal report containing the recommendations for continuation or 
modifications of the study, prepared by [CONTACT_585295], will be 
sent to the Chair of the Steering Committee and the DCC PI. This report will also contain any 
recommendations of the NIDDK in reference to the DSMB recommendations.  It is the responsibility of the DCC PI [INVESTIGATOR_585261].  
 Each report should conclude with a recommendation to continue or to terminate the study. This recommendation should be made by [CONTACT_7558]. A termination recommendation may be made 
by [CONTACT_93534]. The NIDDK is responsible for notifying the Chair of the Steering Committee of a decision to terminate the study. In the event of a split vote in favor of cont inuation, a minority report should be contained within the regular DSMB report. The report should 
not include unblinded data, discussion of the unblinded data, or any other confidential data.  
 Mailings to the DSMB: On a scheduled basis, (as agreed upon by  [CONTACT_4318]) blinded safety data should 
be communicated to all DSMB members and the NIDDK Program Director. Any concerns noted by [CONTACT_585296].  
 Access to Interim Data:  Access to the accumulating endpoint data should be limited to as small a group 
as possible. Limiting the access to interim data to the DSMB members relieves the investigator of the burden of deciding whether it is ethical to continue to randomize patients and helps protect the study  
from bias in patient entry and/or evaluation.  
 CONFIDENTIALITY  
 
All materials, discussions and proceedings of the DSMB are completely confidential. Members and other 
participants in DSMB meetings are expected to maintain confidentiality .

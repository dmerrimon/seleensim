Safety  & Tolerability  of Intraosseous Access  for Hypertonic Saline  Administration:  A Pi[INVESTIGATOR_697181] 
 
I. Objectives:  
 Question:  Is it safe and tolerable  to utilize  intraosseous (IO) access  in the ICU for hypertonic s a-
line (HTS)  administration?  
Hypothesis:  Utilizing  the IO route  for vascular  access  will be safe and tolerable  for administr a-
tion of hypertonic saline  (3%) administration.  
Operational  definitions.  Safety  will be evaluated  based  on absence  of extravasation  of the infu-
sion into the surrounding  tissue  and absence  of tissue  damage proximate  to the IO infusion. Tol-
erability  will be evaluated  based  on absence  of pain severe  enough that the patient  requests  the 
infusion  be stopped or nonverbal  indicators  of pain such as agitation  or pulling at the site. 
 
II. Background and rationale:  
 HTS  is used to mitigate  and temporize  intracranial  pressure  (ICP) elevations  and cerebral  edema 
by [CONTACT_697191].  HTS  is part of the elevated  ICP algorithm in 
the emergency  neurologic  life support protocols (NCS,  2014). HTS  is superior to mann itol which  
is the alternate osmotherapy  agent  (Kamel  et al., 2011 & Ricard,  et al., 2014). HTS  is typi[INVESTIGATOR_697182],  tissue  damag e from  cell implosion  can occur  (Goutos,  et al., 2014) 
 
The IO ro
ute is generally  accepted  in resuscitation  environments including  the emergency  de-
partment,  EMS,  and military  settings  with some  authors  recommending  the IO as a primary  
method  of obtaining  emergency  vascular  access  (Lewis  & Wright,  2014). The adult  advanced  
cardiac life support (ACLS)  guidelines recommend  either  intravenous  or IO access  (Link,  et al, 
2015).  
 
A number  of studies have  established  the safety  of IO administration  of hypertonic s olutions.  
Bebarta,  et al. (2014) randomized  adult  pi[INVESTIGATOR_697183] 7.5% HTS,  IO 3% HTS,  and 0.9% isotonic  
saline  and found  regular  tissue  morphology,  no necrosis  or microscopic  ischemic  changes  in the 
HTS  groups. Several  studies  conducted  to evaluate the efficac y of hypertonic solutions  on resus-
citation  for hemorrhagic  shock  used the IO route  and did not make  note of problems arising  from  
the administration  of IO HTS  (Dubick, et al, 1992; Runyon et al., 1994). Another  study us ing a 
canine model of hemorrhagic  shock briefly mentioned  transient  lameness  in the IO HTS  group, 
but this resolved  by 48 hours  (Orasinski,  Krahwinkel,  & Sanders,  1992). While  the major ity of 
studies using hypertonic saline  solutions  did not make  note of complications,  one study in duced  
hemor rhagic  shock  in dehydrated swine  and resuscitated  one group with 7.5% HTS  and noted  a 
high rate of local complications  from  soft tissue  and bone  marrow  necrosis  (Alam et al., 2002).   
 One stu 
dy noted  a subgroup of patients  in which  IO access  was obtained  on conscious  patients  
(Schalk,  et al., 2011). None  of the patients  received  local anesthetic and none  reported  pain dur-
ing insertion.  Eighteen  of the 22 conscious  patients  reported  pain during fluid administration.  
Gazin,  et al., reported  all 5 conscious  patients  in their study  reported  pain with fluid administr a-
tion (2001). Central  venous  catheter  (CVC) placement  is the current  standard  of care;  even  with 
local  anesthesia it can be painful.  Most  of the potential subjects,  due to the nature  of their severe 
neurologic  injury , may not be affected  by [CONTACT_697192] . Man-
ufacturer  literature suggests the use of lidocaine  to anesthetiz e the bone  before  infusing  if possi-
ble (Teleflex).   
 
It is expected  tha t utilizing  IO for vascular access  in the ICU will be safe and tolerable . If this 
study confirms  the anticipated  results,  there  are numerous implications.  First,  neurologically  in-
jured  patients  requiring  emergent  HTS  may have faster  access  to this therapy.  A study  compa ring 
IO to CVC access  undergoing resuscitation  in the emergency  department  found  IO to be faster  to 
insert  (2.3 vs. 9.9 minutes)  and had fewer  failures  to access  on the first attempt  (Leidel,  et al., 
2009). Second,  serious  complication s from  IO were absent  (Lewis  & Wright, 2014) compared  
with severe  to life-threatening  mechanical  complications  from  CVC including  pneumoth orax, 
damage to the carotid  artery,  and bleeding  which  were cited  at 0.7% -2.1%  depending on site 
(Parienti,  et al., 2015). And thirdly,  central  line associated  blood  stream  infections  (CLABSI)  are 
a leading  cause of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_697184] i-
ty (Lin, et al., 2015). CLABSI  rates  are measured  by [CONTACT_697193] 1,000 catheter 
days and shorter  CVC dwell  time is prudent. If a reliable  and rapid  source  of vascular  access 
could  postpone  or eliminate  CVC insertion,  risk of CLABSI  may be reduced.  These  poten tial 
benefits  outweigh  the minimal expected  risk.

D. Detailed  study  procedures  
Pre-study Training. Use of the EZ-IO device is already  established  at OSUWMC  & The James.  
Key NCCU  nurse  practit ioners  and physicians will receive a standard  one-hour hands -on training 
session  from  the device manufacturer.  Potential  subjects  will be identified  by [CONTACT_697195] i-
cians  and nurse  practitioners  based  on the below  inclusion  and exclusion  criteria .  
 The NCCU  team  will identify  potential subjects:   
Inclusion  criteria :  
NCCU  patients  in which  osmotherapy  with HTS  is planned (standard  of care 
Does  not already  have  a CVC or PI[INVESTIGATOR_6875].  
Exclusion  criteria :  
 <18 years  old 
 Known  pregnancy  
 Long  bone  fracture in the targeted  site  
 Proximity  to prosthetic  joint 
 Excessive tissue/absence  of anatomical  landmarks  
 Cellulitis  over potential insertion  site 
 History  of osteopetrosis  
  
Investigators  or assistants will request  written  or verbal  telephone  consent  from  the patient  or 
surrogate decision  maker  if the patient  is unable  to consent.  An IO will be inserted  and place-
ment  confirmed  by [CONTACT_697196].  40 mg lidocaine  will be slowly  infused  into the IO over 120 seconds,  and then allowed  to 
dwell for 60 seconds  before  infusing  HTS.  Repeat  doses of 20 mg dose of lidocaine  may be used 
as needed  for pain to a cumulative  maximum dose of 1mg/kg over the 24 hour study period. 3% 
HTS  will be bolused through the IO in doses as prescribed  per the NCCU  team.  Serum  sodium  
level  will be sent at 2 and 6 hours  following  the HTS  bolus  and every  6 hours.  Repeat  HTS  bo-
luses  and/or  continuous  infusion  may ordered  per the NCCU  team.  Placeme nt will be confirmed  
before  and at the end of each bolus  as above.  
 
If at any time 
during the study period  the patient  has intolerable  pain,  a CVC or PI[INVESTIGATOR_697187]/PI[INVESTIGATOR_6875].  The IO will be removed.  
 
If serum  sodium  is not appropriately rising  following  IO boluses,  a CVC or PI[INVESTIGATOR_697188]/PI[INVESTIGATOR_6875].   
 
If extravasation  occurs,  a new IO will be placed  at an alternate site and further  monitoring  and 
treatment will be determined .  
 
The IO will be removed  at or before  24 hours.  If continued  vascular  access  is required,  a CVC or 
PI[INVESTIGATOR_697189].  
 
Data collection  and storage  procedure 
This study  will utilize  REDCap  (Research  Electronic Data Capture), a software  toolset  and work-
flow methodology  for electronic collection  and management  of clinical and research  data,  to col-
lect and store  data.  The OSU Center  for Clinical  and Translational  Science  (CCTS)  Research  In-
formatics  Services  will be used as a central  location  for data processi ng and management.  RED-
Cap provides a secure,  web-based  application  that provides an intuitive  data manipulation  inter-
face,  custom  reporting  capabilities,  audit  trail functionality,  real-time data monito ring/querying 
of participant records,  and variations  of data exporting/importing.  REDCap  is hosted by

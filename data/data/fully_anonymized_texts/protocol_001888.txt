BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
 
Overview : 
In those with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) , trauma -related nightmares  are a hallmark 
re-experiencing symptom1, 2 and a common and severe  source of distress3-8 often result ing in 
re-traumatization  due to the lack of insight afforded by [CONTACT_520655]. Proposed research will 
examine whether such  nightmares might serve as targets for imaginal exposure during 
prolonged exposure therapy  (PE),  a first line treatment for PTSD . PE produces significant PTSD 
symptom reduction.9 However, approximately 30% of patients  prematurely drop  out from  PE 
treatment10-[ADDRESS_685804]  still meet diagnostic criteria for PTSD  at end of treatment.12 Thus, 
means for increasing the efficacy of PE are important areas of investigation.17-19 Fear extinction 
learning and memory are the neurocognitive underpi[INVESTIGATOR_528192].17, 20 Because increased 
physiological arousal during PE can aid  in extinction learning,17, 21 recall of trauma -related 
nightmares might serve as an effective target for PE because of their greater immediacy and 
salience relative to the more temporally distant traumatic event . Our research group has 
developed standardized script -driven imagery ( SDI) procedures  whereby [CONTACT_528220][INVESTIGATOR_528193] (index trauma) can be assessed in those with PTSD.
22-25 A canonical 
variable for physiological reactivity to SDI ( SDI-PR) is derived from skin conductance  (SC), 
facial electromyography (EMG) and electrocardiography (ECG) and has served as a unitary, objective measure capable of distinguishing those with versus without clinician -diagnosed 
PTSD .
22, [ADDRESS_685805] ional near-infrared 
spectroscopic (fNIRS) imaging of the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) .30-32 fNIRS  yield s 
concentrations of oxygenated ( O2Hb) and deoxygenated ( HHb) hemoglobin that can be used to 
assess  cortical activation. Specific areas of the LPFC have been shown to activate and/or 
deactivate during SDI of an index trauma in persons with PTSD.33 Notably, t he LPFC includes 
the right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG), a region shown to play a prominent role in inhibiting 
unwanted behavior and cognition ,34-[ADDRESS_685806] time -
stamped nightmare reports following all nightmare -induced awakenings. During two to four  such 
nights, ambulatory polysomnography (PSG)  will allow analysis of sleep physiology immediately 
preceding nightmare awakenings . A trauma -related nightmare report having sufficient length, 
clarity and resemblance to the index trauma will  be selected and recorded as a script for SDI.  
The overarching goal of the proposed research will be to compare within -subject similarities and 
differences in brain and autonomic activation between imaginal replay of a trauma- related 
nightmare versus imaginal replay of the index trauma to determine the relative degree to which 
each evokes  autonomic and frontocortical activations.  
 
 2. Significance:		
Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a major public health issue with l ifetime prevalence 
estimates as high as  7.8%40 and 12-month prevalence as high as 3.6%.41, [ADDRESS_685807] been characterized  as a highly 
specific “hallmark” symptom of PTSD .2, 4, 5 Trauma -related  nightmares (TRNs)  are endorsed 
by [CONTACT_528221] 50 -70%43,44 of individuals with PTSD, even when the traumatic event(s)  occurred 
as long as [ADDRESS_685808] -
deployment baseline and at 6- month follow -up, at which time 41% of nightmare suffers 
continued to meet criteria for PTSD  compared to less than 10% in those who did not experience 
nightmares .47  
Increased physiological arousal during prolonged exposure therapy (PE) can facilitate 
extinction learning .17, 21 Hence recall of TRNs  might serve as an effective target for PE because 
of their greater immediacy and salience relative to the more temporally distant traumatic event . 
Enhancement of extinction learning by [CONTACT_528222] a documented phenomenon in 
experimental and clinical paradigms.17, 21, 56- 58 For example, sustained self -reported arousal 
during exposure  therapy for Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) predicted superior treatment 
outcome.[ADDRESS_685809] that increases noradrenergic neurotransmission 
and arousal.60 In PE, the focus on “hot spots” is a naturalistic example of increasing arousal 
during exposure. Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_528194] “hot spots” after the initial 
recounting of the trauma from start to finish. Hence, we hypothesize that if trauma -nightmare 
SDI elevates responding above that produced by [CONTACT_272353]- trauma SDI, imaginal trauma -
nightmare exposure could improve PE treatment outcome.  
TRNs  rarely occur in the sleep laboratory . Consequently, information on their physiological 
associates during sleep is limited and knowledge of their brain substrates is entirely lacking.2, 3, 
48, 54, 61- [ADDRESS_685810] polysomnography (PSG),44, 48, 54, 62, 63, [ADDRESS_685811] ional near -infrared spectroscopic  (fNIRS) imaging  techniques. Although REM 
may be more conducive to the occurrence of TRNs,2, 5, [ADDRESS_685812] the physiology of 
TRNs used ambulatory PSG,62, 63 one of which reported 57% of nightmares from REM and 3 7% 
from NREM sleep.62 Arousals resulting in nightmare reports are often accompanied by [CONTACT_55628] -
disruptive events such as apneas, leg movements, startle- like arousals ,67 excessive body 
movements68-71 and phasic sympathetic activation.6, 52, 68  
 
Near -Infrared Neuromonitoring : 
Human tissue is sufficiently transparent to near -infrared (NIR) wavelengths (650 -950 nm) to 
enable non -invasive monitoring of brai n oxygenation, perfusion, and neural  activity.30-32 By 
[CONTACT_130828] 2+ colors of NIR light on the scalp and placing a detector some distance away, the 
recorded signals can be used to measure concentrations of oxy -hemoglobin (O 2Hb), deoxy -
hemoglobin (HHb), and total -hemoglobin (HbT, generally pro portional to cerebral blood volum e, 
CBV). We have validated NIRS  sensitivity to functional changes in brain oxygenation against 
 3. simultaneous fMRI72, [ADDRESS_685813] cerebral blood flow and 
volume .74 Given multiple overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_528195], diffuse optical tomography (DOT) 
reconstruction techniques30, 75 -78 can be used to generate 2D or 3D images79, 80 of the same 
cerebral variables, with spatial resolutions  down to ~5 mm .81 Temporal resolution can be 
upwards of 20 Hz .82 The ability of fNIRS to image the brain is limited to the cortical mantle to a 
depth of ~10 mm .83, 84 Consequently, the midline limbic structures such as the amygdala and 
ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), hypothesized to be important to the generation of 
REM -sleep dreams,  and especially their affective content,7, 85, 86 cannot be imaged using fNIRS. 
However, dorsomedial PFC areas lying within ~[ADDRESS_685814] been inversely correlated with amygdala activity in PTSD patients ,87 could  possibly  be 
imaged using NINscan technology.  Positron emission tomography (PET) studies have  
suggested that, during REM sleep, the lateral PFC (LPFC) remains in a deactivated state 
relative to wakefulness.88-90 The relative deactivation of frontal areas may co ntribute to TRNs by 
[CONTACT_528223] -down control of limbic structures.6, 91, 92 Nevertheless, the lateral PFC is 
intimately involved in  the regulation of emotion in the waking state.93 To engage higher level 
emotion regulatory processes such as cognitive reappraisal, the lateral PFC may recruit more 
primit ive paralimbic regions along with their associated functions such as fear extinction.94 
Specifically, the right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG), a lateral region accessible to fNIRS imaging, 
has been uniquely implicated in domain -general inhibition (e.g., of action, cognition, emotion)34-
[ADDRESS_685815] b een reported during script driven imagery (SDI) and 
PTSD symptom provocation paradigms.[ADDRESS_685816] 
region of the late ral PFC may yield important clues as to the neural mechanisms underlying this 
previously inaccessible phenomenon.  
 
SPECIFIC AIMS  
 
Specific Aim 1 : Optimize standard operating procedures for using the NINscan  device in 
our established SDI protocol as a flexible and portable alternative to previously 
employed laboratory- based hardware that lacked simultaneous fNIRS capacity.”  
Hypothesis 1 : “NINscan will be easily optimized for SDI assessment in the MGH 
psychophysiology laboratory including event marking and systems for viewing incoming data in real time .”  
Specific Aim 2 : Compare autonomic reactivity (SDI-PR) and fNIRS activation of the LPFC 
during SDI of  the index trauma  script  and a trauma -related nightmare  script.  
Hypothesis  2: SDI-PR and LPFC activations during SDI of the trauma -nightmare script will 
exceed activations during SDI of the index -trauma.  
Exploratory Aim 1: Determine whether the sleep stage immediately prior to trauma -
nightmare awakenings and the trauma -nightmare content determine which individuals 
respond more to trauma- nightmare SDI or show a greater response to index -trauma SDI. 
Explorat ory hypothesis 1A:  Individuals for whom the nightmare used to create their trauma -
nightmare script was preceded, before awakening, by [CONTACT_528224], will show greater SDI -PR and rIFG HbD responses to the trauma -nightmare script than to the index -
trauma script.   
Exploratory hypothesis 1B : Individuals for whom the trauma -nightmare script is judged most 
similar to the index trauma and/or the most severely stressful by 3 independent judges will show 
 4. greater SDI -PR and rIFG HbD responses to the nightmare  script, compared to the index -trauma 
script.

SUBJECT ENROLLMENT AND SCREENING  
 
Sampling Plan, recruitment, and retention strategies : 
There are highly specific requirements for participants to begin Phase [ADDRESS_685819] recent [LOCATION_005] census.  
 
Recruitment  
The recruitment target  is for 50 participants  (25 male and 25  female) to complete Phases 1- 3 of 
the study. Withdrawals from the study will be replaced such that the targets for study completers are achieved. W e will enroll 2 -3 participants/month. Participants will be recruited through: the 
[LOCATION_011] Medical Center, the  VA [LOCATION_011] Healthcare System  specialty mental health clinics, the 
National Center for PTSD participant re -contact [INVESTIGATOR_56905], the Red Sox Foundation and 
[LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_528196] , outreach to military or first -responder 
organizations i ncluding our ongoing collaboration with the [LOCATION_011] Fire Department, and 
outreach to the general public (see below). Key personnel in this study provide access to PTSD patient populations at the above facilities. Specifically, our Consultant, Suzanne Pi[INVESTIGATOR_528197] s, Ph.D. 
is an investigator and Clinical Psychologist in the National Center for PTSD and  is Assistant 
Professor in the Department of Psychiatry at [LOCATION_011] University School of Medicine  (for which 
the [LOCATION_011] Medical Center serves as a teaching hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) and  Co-Investigator Kaloyan Tanev, 
MD is Medical Director of the Home Base Outpatient Clinic. O utreach to the general public will 
occur via internet  bulletin boards , social media, MGH research participation websites  (e.g., 
“Rally,” “RSVP for health” ), e-posting and physical postings at universities,  re-contact [CONTACT_528226] -contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] (this is 
included in our consent forms) . Notably, at  the VA [LOCATION_011] Healthcare System  alone, 6,[ADDRESS_685820]. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_307593]’  previous experiences recruiting 
participants with PTSD  at the VA [LOCATION_011] Healthcare System , we anticipate no difficulty meetin g 
our recruitment goal  of 2-3 participants/month.  
  
Retention  
Any withdrawals from the study will be replaced such that a total of [ADDRESS_685821] aff to return the equipment (usually on the following day). At each evening visit, 
participants will also meet with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_528198] -Suicide 
Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS)
[ADDRESS_685822] encountered with the study procedures and will be able to solve such problems with 
staff assistance. As in all of our studies, participants are encouraged to call the PI 24/7 with any concerns. For additional incentive to complete all study assessments, we offer a $ [ADDRESS_685823] phase of the study. They will then be called and given a detailed description of the study. If they c ontinue to be interested in 
participation, a phone screening will be conducted by [CONTACT_528227] a trained  
research a ssistant. Those not meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria or who choose not to 
participate will, therefore, remain anonym ous. In the phone screening, major inclusion criteria 
will be confirmed and exclusion criteria ruled out based upon  the candidate participant’s  self-
report. Candidate participants ’ names, addresses and email addresses will be obtained if (and 
only if) they  are determined to meet these initial inclusion/exclusion criteria  and wish to 
participate.   
 6.  
STUDY PROCEDURES  
 Overview of protocol : The protocol consists of screenings followed by 3 experimental Phases. 
Individuals diagnosed with PTSD who report f requent TRNs will be recruited from the MGH -Red 
Sox Foundation’s Home Base program, the [LOCATION_011] VA Medical Center, local hospi[INVESTIGATOR_528199], and from the community . Interested individuals  will first complete a telephone screening 
followed by  a series o f structured clinical interviews using a Zoom Healthcare S ecure Room to 
diagnose PTSD and comorbid psychiatric disorders, confirm initial inclusion criteria, rule out 
exclusion criteria and create an audio -recorded account of their index trauma. Participants 
passing screenings will then proceed to Phase [ADDRESS_685824] actigraph throughout this period, complete two 
to four nights of ambulatory PSG, and complete on-line questionnaires. Nightmare data will be 
examined for frequency and thematic similarity of nightmares to  a participant’s reported index 
trauma. Those reporting at least [ADDRESS_685825] one that is clearly related to the 
index trauma a nd sufficiently detailed for script creation will be invited to participate  in Phase 2 . 
Phase 2 participants will undergo a structural MRI scan and will then be scheduled to undergo 
MRI-guided positioning of fNIRS sources and optodes using the BrainSight2 System . Phase 3 . 
Participants’ nightmare and index trauma reports will be audio -recorded for use as scripts during 
SDI. The participant will then undergo two SDI sessions on a single day, one with a nightmare script and one with an index -trauma script, dur ing which they will wear the NINscan. Sessions 
will be separated by 1 hour and counterbalanced across participants for script order.  
 Informed Consent: 
When a candidate subject responds to an advertisement, they will be instructed to leave a 
phone number but remain anonymous until accepted into the first phase of the study. They will 
then be called and given a detailed description of the study. If they co ntinue to be interested in 
participation, a phone screening will be conducted by a trained post -doctoral fellow or research 
assistant . Those not meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria or who choose not to participate will, 
therefore, remain anonymous.  
 During the phone screening, major inclusion criteria will be confirmed and exclusion criteria 
ruled out based upon the candidate participant’s  self-report. Candidate participants ’ names, 
addresses and email addresses will be obtained only when they are determi ned to meet these 
initial inclusion/exclusion criteria. They will then be scheduled for a visit to MGH to sign a 
consent form, complete questionnaires,  be given the C -SSRS,  and provide a hand -written 
account of their trauma as well as a urine toxicology sa mple. The day before the subject comes 
to MGH to sign consent they will be sent a copy of the consent form via email so that they may 
read it ahead of signing.   
 
They will then come to MGH to provide written informed  consent , complete a urine toxicology 
screen,  fill out the Life Events Checklist (LEC -5), fill out the PCL -5, provide a hand -written 
account of their trauma,  and will be paid an additional $ 30. No minors or other individuals 
unable to provide informed consent will be recruited.  All individuals invited to the interview will 
undergo the entire interview. Those excluded or placed on a waiting list will be paid $50 for their 
time. 
 
Screening : Participant candidates will first complete a telephone screening  for the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria detailed in “Protection of Human Subjects ” and summarized below. Those 
passing telephone screening will undergo  psychiatric and sleep disorders interviews  using the 
 7. Structured Clinical Interview for DSM -5, Research Version  (SCID -5-RV)96 and the Clinical 
Interview for DSM -5 Sleep Disorders Module (SCISD),97 and screened for suicidality using the 
Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS) .95 They will then be screened for PTSD 
symptomatology  with the CAPS -5, PCL-5, Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) ,98 Trauma 
History Questionnaire (THQ) ,[ADDRESS_685826] for DSM -5 (LEC -5)100 and Peri-traumatic   
Distress Inventory (PDI) .[ADDRESS_685827] 2 nightmares per week related to a specific “index trauma” that 
contains veridical content reminiscent of the index trauma. Phase [ADDRESS_685828] one that is suitable for SDI.  
 
Phase 1 : Participants accepted to Phase [ADDRESS_685829] of bodily sensations that they might experience during nightmares,  and 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_528200]/Morning Sleep Questionnaire (EMSQ) diary.102, 103 All nightmares 
resulting in awakenings will be recorded at the time of awakening. Participants will be instructed 
to depress the actiwatch event marker when they awaken and when they complete recording 
and to estimate the subjective duration of the nightmare. Audio -recorded n ightmare reports will 
be compared, by [CONTACT_464], with the audio- recorded narrative account of the index trauma . 
Participants will also complete a battery of questionnaires , remotely , and two to four  nights of 
ambulatory PSG using the Somte -PSG ambulatory recorder (Compumedics [LOCATION_003], Inc., 
Charlotte, NC) . The first night will screen  for sleep disorders and acclimate participants to PSG. 
Participants who do not record 4+ TRNs one of which is suitable for SDI during Phase 1 will be 
debriefed, paid for portions of the study completed and discharged.  
 
Phase 2 : Participants will undergo a structural T1 MPRAGE MRI scan. This will be used along 
with the BrainSigh t Frameless Stereotactic System (Rogue Research, Inc., Montreal, C N) to 
localize fNIRS optodes at [ADDRESS_685830] (ROIs) (4 per hemisphere) including the frontopolar cortex (BA 10), as well as superior (BA 9), middle (BA 46) and inferior (BA  47) 
frontal gyri.  
 Phase 3:  When we capture a suitable nightmare from a participant, the recorded nightmare 
report  will be transcribed  and audio- recorded by [CONTACT_528228] a TRN  script  following our 
standard procedures.28 Participants will then come to the laboratory and complete 2 SDI  
session s with NINscan monitoring , one of which  will use the script derived from the TRN and the 
other the script derived from the index trauma. Presentation order of the script s derived from the 
TRN  and from the index t rauma will be cou nterbalanced across participants. Because PTSD 
symptomatology and extinction memory may vary with the menstrual cycle,104-106 female 
participants not on oral contraceptives will undergo SDI during the early follicular phase of their 
cycle.  
  
Script Driven Imag ery: Adapting standardized SDI protocols,22, 26- 28 scripts will be created from 
audio- recorded accounts of the index trauma about which a participant’s  TRNs  represent a re -
experiencing. The audio -recorded report  and list of bodily sensations experienced  from an 
awakening during Phase [ADDRESS_685831] 
generic scripts of both neutral and emotional  situations (2 each of neutral , fearful  and positive 
 8. experiences) will also be recorded. Script  record ings will be  played to participants through 
headphones as  they vividly imagine each event  and physiological data are continuously 
sampled . 
 
Processing of fNIRS signal : Accelerometry data will be used to identify any head motions 
during the measurement periods. The 25 -Hz optical data (raw -background) will be digitally low 
pass filtered at 5Hz followed by [CONTACT_528229] -Lambert Law107 per channel, 
following our previous work.108 This will provide continuous measures of O2Hb, HHb, and HbT 
concentrations relative to resting baseline.  
 PSG  measures : Sleep measures  obtained from ambulatory PSG will include amounts of each 
sleep -stage (N1, N2, N3, REM) as a percent of total sleep time (TST) and s pectral power  in 7 
frequency bands within each sleep stage. REM -specific measures include REM latency, REM 
fragmentation,109 REM rapid e ye movement density (REMD),110 REM power in the theta (4 -7Hz) 
frequency (REMtheta),111 and heart rate variability during REM.112, 113 On the diagnostic night, 
pulse -oximeter, respi[INVESTIGATOR_528201] s, nasal cannula and tibialis channels  will be added to 
screen for OSA and periodic limb movement disorder . Any participant showing 10 + apneas or 
hypopneas/h or >15 leg movements with arousals/h, will be withdrawn  and referred  to a sleep 
clinic. A n experienced research PSG technician  will score sleep using AASM  criteria.114, 115 
NINscan -based PSG measures will be scored as in our previous work108, 116, 117 using the same  
criteria.114, 115 
 
Structural M RI: images will be acquired with a 32- channel head coil in a 3T Siemens Prisma 
scanner  using automated scout and shimming  and high -resolution 3D T1 MPRAGE sequences 
(TR/TE 1,2,3,4/flip angle = 2530ms/1.69, 3.55, 5.41, 7.27ms/7°) with an in -plane resolution and 
slice thickness of 1.0 mm. 
  
Targeting ROIs using BrainSight Frameless Stereotactic System:  The BrainSight  system 
enables real -time visualization of probe locations relative to a subject’s previously acquired 
structural MRI image allowing  precise, unobtrusive placement of optical probes with respect to 
underlying  anatomy. The device can be used to non -invasive ly and accurately locate fNIRS 
optodes on a subject ’s scalp over specific cortical areas. We will visualize 100 mm2 circular 
ROIs (approximately 8, 10mm -diameter fNIRS voxels)  centered on specific MNI coordinates in 
each subject in order to ensure imaging approximately the same LPFC areas across subjects.  
  
Actigraphy and sleep diary:  The waterproof Actiwatch 2 (Philips Respi[INVESTIGATOR_5770], Bend, OR) is 
worn on the non -dominant wrist 24h/day118, 119 and counts arm movements in 1 -min epochs. 
Participants press an event marker when beginning to attempt sleep and when waking for the 
day. Epochs are scored as sleep or wake using a standardized algorithm. The EMSQ102, 103 
queries daytime activities and the time one begins attempting sleep  (evening), and wake  time, 
subjective sleep latency , total sleep time, and number of awakenings  (morning) . 
 
Self-report assessments : A secure online MGH system will obtain the:  1.) Pi[INVESTIGATOR_8326] 120 with PTSD addendum;121 2.) Insomnia Severity Index;122 3.) Morningness -
Eveningness questionnaire;123 4.) Spi[INVESTIGATOR_73593] -Trait Anxiety I nventory ;124 and 5.) Inventory 
of Depressive Symptomatology .125  
 
Outcome and predictor variables : For Hypothesis 2, outcomes will be “difference scores”  
between biosignals  from the 30 -s trauma- related epoch of the nightmare and index -trauma SDI 
and their baseline epochs (30 s of silence preceding the respective script).22, 26- 28 For fNIRS, the 
quantities used to compute difference scores will be O2Hb minus HHb concentration s (HbD)30, 72 
 9. at each ROI. Peripheral outcome will be SDI -PR22, 26 -28 computed from HR, SC and EMG 
responses to the index trauma and nightmare sc ripts. Primary outcome of Exploratory 
Hypotheses 1 A and 1B will be whether or not SDI -PR an d HbD are larger in response to 
trauma -nightmare SDI than to index trauma SDI. Predictor variables for E xploratory Hypothesis 
1A will be sleep stage  prior to awakening from trauma nightmare.  Predictor variables for 
Exploratory Hypothesis 1B will be ratings  by 3 judges, blind to all other participant data, on two 
7-point Likert -type scales  of 1) the degree of similarity between each individual’s index -trauma 
and trauma- nightmare scripts, and 2) the emotional severity of the recorded trauma- nightmare 
experience.  
 
Statistical analyses : As feasibility assessments of NINscan methodology, Hypothesi s 1 The 
qualitative optimization of NINscan’s biosensor configuration, biosignal acquisition, event 
marking, and interface with software delivering SDI stimuli, rather than quantitative hypothesis 
testing, is the focus of  Aim [ADDRESS_685832] Hypothesis 2, the two primary outcome variables (rIFG 
fNIRS  HbD and S DI-PR) will be compared between trauma -nightmare and index -trauma SDI 
using multiple regression  adjusting for age, sex and duration since trauma.  Secondary 
outcome variables (HbD from the 7 remaining fNIRS ROIs ) will be compared between groups 
using the same regression model as for the primary fNIRS outcome s ad justing  for multiple 
comparisons using the false discovery rate .126 Analysis of Exploratory Hypothesis 1A:  We will 
investigate whether a stronger response to the trauma -nightmare as compared to the index -
trauma script  is associated with REM sleep using  logistic regression, with REM sleep (0/1), sex 
(M/F)  and duration since  trauma as predictors . Analysis of Exploratory Hypothesis 1B : The 
similarity between the trauma -nightmare and index- trauma  scripts and the severity of the 
trauma -nightmare script will be evaluated for each subject by 3  judges using 7-point Likert 
scale s. The relationship between these evaluations and a greater SDI-PR or rIFG HbD 
response to trauma -nightmare than index -trauma SDI will be assessed using ordinal regression, 
with sex, judge  ID, and duration since trauma as additional covariates.  
 
Power analysis : For the primary outcome in Aim 2 , we will compare physiological response 
and fNIRS in the rLIFC between scripts for the index trauma  and the associated nightmare in 
each of 40 subje cts completing the study (i.e., dropouts will be replaced) . Based on a paired t -
test at the 0.05/2 two -tailed significance level (adjusting for the two outcome measures), we will 
have 80% power to detect an effect size of d=0.50. In order to power the hypo thesis  in 
Exploratory Aim [ADDRESS_685833] one nightmare and that 60% 
of these nightmares will occur during REM sleep.[ADDRESS_685834] 80% power to 
detect whether the probability of having greater SDI -PR or rIFG HbD response to the trauma -
nightmare, compared to the index -trauma script is 0.70 or greater for patients who had 
nightmares du ring REM sleep, and 0.30 or less for those whose nightmares were not during 
REM sleep, based on Fisher's exact test, at the 0.05 two -tailed significance level . 
 
 
 
POTENTIAL RISKS AND PROTECTION FROM RISKS  
 
Risks of self -report during clinical screening, completing questionnaires and recording 
nightmares:    
Participants may feel uncomfortable or embarrassed revealing psychological information during 
clinical interviews and when completing questionnaires . Interviews and questionnaires  may also 
induce  negative emotional reactions due to the reactivation of trauma -related memories. For the 
same reason, dictating dream reports following awakenings from nightmares may induce or 
 10. exacerbate trauma -related negative emotional reactions . The protections from t hese risks that 
we implement are detailed below.    
  
Risks from  script -driven imagery (SDI) procedures : 
Risks from the SDI procedure primarily include negative emotional reactions to the reactivation 
of trauma -related memories. There is a chance that recalling one’s traumatic memories could 
worsen PTSD symptoms. However, we regard this as unlikely for two re asons. First, subjects 
with PTSD repeatedly experience traumatic memory reactivations as a feature of the disorder. 
Second, we have reactivated traumatic memories in hundreds of PTSD subjects during more 
than 30 years’ experience with the script preparatio n procedure and have found few instances 
of symptomatic exacerbation. The protections from these risks that we implement are detailed 
below.     
 Risks from  NIRS and NINscan monitoring : 
NIRS is an investigational tool in regular use for over [ADDRESS_685835] with the skin. It is possible that skin irritation could occur beneath sensor s. The study team has 
received extensive training on the psychophysiological procedures and this will minimize 
discomfort from the application of the electrodes.  
 
Risks from  ambulatory polysomnography:   
The removal of some of the sleep recording electrodes and sensors placed with tape may pull 
slightly on exposed skin and feel like a  band- aid being removed. Participants may feel this 
sensation despi[INVESTIGATOR_528202]’s skin.  
Participants may not sleep as well as usual when wearing ambulatory PSG equipment . As a 
result they may be sleep deprived and feel tired in the morning.  
 
Risks from  structural MRI:  
Although MR I is thought to be hazard free, some subjects may find the enclosed space of the 
scanner  to be physically uncomfortable or anxiety -producing. Every effort will be made to 
reassure the patient and minimize any discomforts while in the fMRI scanner . Subjects will  be 
able to converse with a staff member via a microphone and speaker system. Every effort will be 
made to reassure the patient and minimize any such discomforts. Noise from the scanner can 
also cause discomfort. To reduce the discomfort caused by [CONTACT_528230], subjects will wear 
earplugs that minimize ambient scanner noise while still allowing communication with staff. Subjects may ask to have a scan stopped and discontinue participation in the study at any time.  
 
Unexpected Findings : 
As NIRS is not a clin ical measurement, it is possible , but unlikely , that we could find a clinical 
abnormality in healthy participants.  Unexpected findings may also occur during the structural 
MRI.  
 
Accidental data release : 
There is a small possibility of an inadvertent release of a subject’s data with identifiable 
information, as with any electronic data.  
 
 
 11. Protection Against Risks   
 
Written informed consent will be obtained from each subject . Subjects can request that a study 
be stopped at any time during their participation.  
 
Repeated safety assessments : 
We will conduct careful screen ing to identify individuals at higher risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_528203], for example those with a history of active suicidal ideation or attempt and those with 
current suicidal ideation. Such individuals will not be enrolled in the study and appropriate clinical care and referrals will be provided. Either [CONTACT_528244] or [CONTACT_419903] -Schott  (a 
[LOCATION_005] L icensed Mental Health Counselor) will use Zoom to administer the C-SSRS
[ADDRESS_685836] co-investigators on our protocol (Kaloyan Tanev, MD and John 
W. Winkelman, MD, PhD ). Minimally, the participant will be instructed on how to contact [CONTACT_9435]'s 
Acute Psychiatry Service (APS), which provides emergent psychiatric care on a  24-hour/day 
basis for individuals in the [LOCATION_005] area. We also provide a complete listing of 
emergency mental health services in [LOCATION_011]. However, if acute suicidality or other psychiatric 
distress is detected while a participant is enrolled in the p rotocol, we will accompany them to the 
MGH Emergency Department and remain with them until they are evaluated by [CONTACT_528231]. If a participant develops suicidal ideation outside of study 
visits they will have the PI ’s number  that can be called 24/[ADDRESS_685837] 
procedures for  addressing such issues at MGH will be followed.  
 Clinical screening :  
Because trauma history is being evaluated, w e expect a degree of emotional distress during the 
screening  sessions. The risk of an increase in symptoms during screening  will be discusse d 
during the informed consent process. If an adverse emotional reaction occur s during screening , 
a psychologist  (Drs. Lasko or Pi[INVESTIGATOR_307593]), psychiatrist  (Drs. Tanev or Winkelman) or a Licensed 
Mental Health Counselor ([CONTACT_419903] -Schott, the PI) will be available for guidance and 
intervention , including making referrals to initiate or supplement treatment, carrying out the 
emergency procedures detailed above and/or withdrawing  the participant from the study.  
 
Home -based nightmare reporting : 
Shoul d a sever e emotional reaction occur during nightmare reporting,  participants will be 
instructed first to go to the nearest emergency room. They can also contact [CONTACT_978], [CONTACT_419903] -
Schott, a Licensed Mental Health Counselor (LMHC), 24h/day, 7 days per week and he can 
also provide  guidance . If nightmare recording elicits persisting distress during the following 
day(s), the above noted clinicians will be available for guidance and intervention, including 
making referrals to initiate or supplement treatment, carrying out the emergency procedures detailed above and/or withdrawing  the participant from the study.  We will further protect 
participants by [CONTACT_528232].  
 Script -driven imagery : 
We will seek to protect participants from the emotional distress that might be aroused by [CONTACT_528233] . Only investigators and highly trained research assistant s 
 12. will conduct the SDI procedure . If an adverse emotional reaction occur s during SDI, a 
psychologist  (Drs. Lasko or Pi[INVESTIGATOR_307593]),  psychiatrist  (Drs. Tanev or Winkelman) or a Licensed 
Mental Health Counselor ([CONTACT_419903] -Schott, the PI) will be available for guidance and 
intervention, including making referrals to initiate or supplement treatment, carrying out the 
emergency procedures detailed above and/or withdrawing  the participant from the study.  
Participants will be reminded at each study visit that they are free to withdraw from the  study at 
any point.  There is a lso a  chance that recalling one’s traumatic memories could worsen PTSD 
symptoms. However, we regard this as unlikely for two reasons. First, subjects with PTSD 
repeatedly experience traumatic memory reactivations as a feature  of the disorder. Using SDI, 
we have reactivated traumatic memories in hundreds of PTSD subjects during more than 30 
years’ experience with the script preparation procedure and have found few instances of symptomatic exacerbation.  As noted above, all parti cipants will be assessed for suicidal ideation 
at every study visit including the SDI sessions.  
 Ambulatory p olysomnography:  
All subjects will be told that sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_528204] , especially after 
the first night, can result in some sleep loss and resultant daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008]. They will be cautioned not to drive or operate dangerous machinery until they determine that they are fully alert. After being instrumented for ambulatory Somte -PSG recording  during Phase [ADDRESS_685838]. The PI  [INVESTIGATOR_528205] 24 hours a day , 7 days per 
week,  to address any particip ant concerns throughout the study . 
 
Near -Infrared Spectroscopy : 
NIR light delivery by [CONTACT_528234] 
(MPE) level for long -duration (8 h ) exposures, which is the ANSI limit for light delivery at these 
wavelengths. Moreover, the CW -NIRS light sources are diffused and diverge in a wide angle 
(>50 deg) at the probe end because of a diffusing filter affixed over the light source. This results in a Nominal Ocular Hazard Distance (NOHD) of less than 5 cm, whi ch is lower than the 10 cm 
focusing distance of the retina. Hence, the NIRS measurements do not necessitate eye 
protection.  
 
MRI: 
A pregnancy test (urine ß -HCG) will be conducted prior to the structural MRI for all women of 
child -bearing capacity ; a positi ve test will preclude scanning. Three  levels of screening for 
metallic objects on or inside the bo dy are completed prior to MRI scanning session. First, 
participants are queried during the initial telephone screening and anyone with a pacemaker, 
medication  pump, vagal stimulator, deep brain stimulator, TENS unit, ventriculo -peritoneal shunt 
or any other introduced metal such as shrapnel are disqualified. Second, before the anatomical 
scanning session , each participant must complete the Martinos Center Patie nt/Volunteer 
Screening Form. An affirmative answer to most items on this form disqualifies the participant. A 
few items (e.g., tattoos), however, may be brought to the attention of the Martinos Center MRI managers who alone can determine whether or not thi s participant can be scanned. Third , 
participants must pass through a ferrous metal detector before entering the MRI environment. 
The Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging has clearly written and posted safety protocols 
designed for all contingencies asso ciated with MRI scanning and the MRI environment. This 
includes a protocol for rapi[INVESTIGATOR_528206] . All research staff who 
participate in MRI scanning at the Martinos Center must have completed MRI safety training. In addition, a Martinos Center Certified MRI Scanner must be present at all scanning sessions and 
[ADDRESS_685839] pass an examination administered by [CONTACT_528235]. The 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_528207].  
 Unexpected Findings :  
Although MRI and fNIRS scans associated with this protocol are for research purposes only, an 
MGH  radiologist is available for consultation whenever a  brain anomaly is noted.  If necessary, 
the radiologist will inform the participant of the finding and offer to communicate that information 
to their physician of choice (e.g., primary care or specialist) for follow -up. 
 
Data Protection :  
All study staff will be trained on the importance of confidentiality. All research staff must have 
successfully completed the Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative  (CITI) basic training for 
biomedical researchers as well as periodic refresher trainings. All data will be coded with a 
random alphanumeric subject code, unrelated to the participant’s name, initials, or dates related 
to their participation. All research data will be labeled with this code only, and the mappi[INVESTIGATOR_528208] -protected location 
accessible only by [CONTACT_528236]. Only the PI [INVESTIGATOR_528209]- investigators  will have access to the subject’s personal data.  
 
POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH TO HUMAN SUBJECTS AND OTHERS  
 
Benefit to subject : 
 
It is anticipated that most subjects will not derive direct benefit from participation in th e study . 
However, participants will be referred, if desired, to appropriate clinical services should any 
serious psychopathology be noted during clinical psychiatric screenings, any sleep disorder noted during the clinical sleep interview or the acclimation/sleep disorder screening night or if 
any anomaly is noted on their structural MRI. In addition, if desired by [CONTACT_2299], referrals 
can be made for treatment of PTSD at any point be fore, during or after the study . The 
investigators are well positioned to ma ke such referrals given their extensive network of clinician 
colleagues at MGH and other [LOCATION_011] area hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]. There will be no costs incurred by [CONTACT_528237] a participant in planned procedures.  
 
Importance of the knowledge to be gained : 
 During PE for  PTSD,  trauma -related nightmares  might offer target s for exposure  treatments that 
are of greater immediacy and salience than the more temporally distant index trauma that 
originally precipi[INVESTIGATOR_528210]’s PTSD. As such, use of trauma -related nightmar es might 
strengthen arousal during PE and thereby [CONTACT_528238]. The proposed research will provide preliminary evidence as to 
whether or not this is the case by [CONTACT_528239] b rain responses to script-
driven imagery of the original traumatic experience to script -driven imagery of a recent trauma-
related nightmare. Additionally, the ability to assess activity in the LPFC during SDI might 
provide crucial information relating to in dividual differences in treatment response. For example, 
greater engagement of the LPFC  following transcranial magnetic stimulation has been shown to 
predict treatment outcome from PE in PTSD.
[ADDRESS_685840] glimpse into LPFC activity duri ng nightmares, and could generate hypotheses on 
potential methods to  assess treatments of nightmares (pharmacological or behavioral) in 
naturalistic settings.    
 
 14. Compensation : 
 
Participants will be paid up to a maximum of  $[ADDRESS_685841] practice. Partial completion of the study will be 
compensated on the following schedule.  
 
$30 for in -person visit to MGH to sign consent and perform urine toxicology screen.  
$70 for completing on-line clinical in terviews  
$150 for completing Phase 1  of the study ( 14 days of audio- recording of experienced 
nightmares, nightmare and sleep diaries,  actigraph y, 2-4 ambulatory PSG nights, online 
questionnaires ) 
$125 for completing the 2 script -driven imagery procedures  and positioning of fNIRS optodes   
$100 bonus for completing entire protocol  
 
Participants will be informed that they will be discontinued in the study if:  (a) if at the clinical 
interviews  they do not meet study criteria, (b) if they produce a positive urine toxicology  screen 
after signing consent , (c) if they produce a positive pregnancy test  at the structural MRI, (d) if a 
sleep disorder is detected on the diagnostic night of ambulatory PSG, (e) if an insufficient 
number TRNs are obtained during Phase 1.  However, they will be compensated in full for the 
activities they have completed based upon the schedule above.

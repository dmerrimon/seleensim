 Currently RBC units that have been stored up to 42 days are available for transfusion. Increasing RBC 
storage duration has been shown to alter r ed cells by [CONTACT_685618], creating proinflammatory and 
immunomodulatory effects, as well as reducing red cell deformability, and aggregability. Prior observational 
investigations report variable results in terms of morbid outcomes related t o increasing length of RBC storage.  
We propose a randomized blinded clinical trial with a maximum enrollment of 2840 adult cardiac surgical 
patients. Consecutive consenting patients who meet the inclusion criteria will be randomized to ‘age of blood’ less  
than two weeks or greater than 20 days shelf life for all of the units allocated to the patient. The trial uses a group 
sequential design with three internal interim analyses that examine group sequential boundaries of both efficacy 
and futility. The over all type I error rate is 0.05 and power is 85%. The study we propose will provide an 
appropriate level of evidence for determining whether increased storage duration is associated with increased 
morbidity. We estimate that it will take approximately 2-3 years to complete the enrollment and randomization .

Amendment 8  
05/17/2010  3 A. Specific Aims  
 
 During preservation, RBC undergo functional and structural changes. What is termed  ‘storage lesion’ is 
an amalgamation of reversible and irreversible rheological changes that may begin in the second week of storage, 
progress with storage duration [ADDRESS_929420] 
outcomes such as survival or length of stay. 16 Although there are well -documented changes in rheologic 
properties with increasing length of RBC storage 1, 2, 17, 18, it is unknown whether these changes contribute to 
adverse patient outcome following transfusion. O ur objective was to determine whether length of RBC storage 
duration is associated with adverse morbid outcomes in a large cohort of patients undergoing cardiac surgery.  
Among patients who are transfused RBC units, we will randomize units to less than two  weeks and greater than 
20 days storage.  
 
 Our primary aim is to determine whether length of storage of RBC is related to postoperative morbid 
outcomes.  
 
 The purpose  of a RBC  transfusion is to increase tissue oxygenation, thereby [CONTACT_685619] d ebt. 
During storage progressive morphological and biochemical changes occur to the RBC product which may 
contribute to a reduction in microvascular tissue flow and contribute to tissue hypoxia.19-[ADDRESS_929421] of RBC transfusion on tissue oxygenation is rarely measured. Therefore, a quantitative evaluation of the 
effectiveness of stored RBC  in increasing tis sue oxygenation is required to assess the risk of  complications related 
to tissue oxygenation and storage duration of the RBC units transfused . 
 
 
Amendment 8  
05/17/2010  4 B. Background and Significance:  
 
Effect of RBC Storage Time  
 
 Considerable evidence suggests that transfusion s increase the risk of serious complications and mortality 
in both cardiac  surgical  patients  24-[ADDRESS_929422] were 
units transfused with storage durations greater than 3 weeks. Among patients with type AB negative, up to 68.4% 
of units tra nsfused were greater than [ADDRESS_929423] 
of the storage period. 1 23 Furthermore, storage time progres sively reduces levels of nitric oxide 38 and reductions 
in adenosine triphosphate  (likely correlati ng with reduced post -transfusion survival). Recent work by [CONTACT_685620] 21demonstrated impaired vasodilatory res ponse to hypoxia secondary to reductions in nitric oxide 
bioactivity with storage duration.[ADDRESS_929424] described progressive time -related 
alterations in erythrocyte shape and deformability beginning as early as 2 weeks duration an d progressing 
throughout storage.  Recent work by [CONTACT_685621] 39 demonstrated that increased RBC storage duration 
was associated with an increase in the number and strength of adhesion of RBC to the vascular endothelium. Of 
note, the authors comment that these findings are of impor tance as increased adhesion of RBC to the vascular 
endothelium can reduce tissue oxygen delivery due to a reduction in local tissue blood flow.39, 40 
 
 Mynster and colleagues 6 reported transfusion of blood stored > [ADDRESS_929425] described progressive time -related alterations in erythrocyte shape and deformability 
beginning as early as 2 weeks duration and progressing throughout storage.  Kirkpatrick 18 and colleagues 
similarly reported markedly abnormal flow and biochemical properties of blood cells in stored bank blood and 
salvaged blood. While some of the storage related changes in RBC are reversible such as restoration of 2,3 DPG, 
it has been reported that that recovery of 2,3 DPG may be at 50 -70% of normal at [ADDRESS_929426] calorimetry for up to 6 hours following RBC transfusion. In addition, they found an inverse association 
between the changes in gastric intramucosal pH and the age of the transfus ed blood for patients who received 
RBC stored >15 days. Furthermore, patients receiving old RBC developed evidence of splanchnic ischemia.  The 
authors postulated that the poorly deformable transfused RBC caused microcirculatory occlusion in some organs, 
potentially contributing to tissue ischemia. While RBC physiology is restored with time following transfusion, the

transfusion. 13  
 Zallen and colleagues reported that the age of red blood cells was an independent predictor of  multiple 
organ failure. 5   Similarly, in a small investigation of 61 trauma patients, Offner and colleague s, 15 reported that 
transfusion of older blood was associated with increased infection following major trau matic injury. The authors 
15 commented on the laboratory work of Silliman and colleagues 43, 44 describing the significant priming of the 
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase system after 2 weeks storage, reaching a peak at the shelf 
life of the RBC units and thought to be primarily due to accumulation of proinflammatory lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805] . 45  
  
 There are however, investigations that do not report adverse effects of RBC storage time as reflected by 
[CONTACT_685622] 7, 8. Vamvakas and colleagues 12 reported no increase in postoperative 
morbidity (as defined by [CONTACT_685623], length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_685600]) with length of storage in [ADDRESS_929428] with increasing storage time of 
RBC units on 30 -day survival, and ICU and hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_685601] -points. In a small investigation, Weiskopf 
and colleagues 37 reported that both fresh and stored blood were similarly efficacious in reversing anemia -induced 
brain oxygen deficits.37 A recent investigation by [CONTACT_685624]36 reported similar clinical outcomes for 
RBC units of varying storage duration in 670 cardiac surgical patients. The investigation was limited  due to an 
inability to separately analyze patients receiving exclusively fresh vs. older RBC units; the impact of patients 
receiving an admixture of RBC units with varying storage duration is unknown. In addition, the sample size and 
number of outcome eve nts was limited.36  
 Ho et al 3 recently highlighted RBC storage duration and the relationship to the efficacy of transfusion. 
Their review examined the clinical evidence for  benefit/harm of RBC transfusions and possible adverse effects 
associated with changes in RBC storage.[ADDRESS_929429] plot of unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios and their

 In a separate investigation 25 , we demonstrated the association between RBC transfusion and an incr eased 
early (within 6 months after surgery) and late hazard (out to 10 years) for death. We examined the incremental 
influence of perioperative RBC transfusion and component therapy on long -term survival after isolated coronary 
artery by[CONTACT_685625], comorbidity, operative factors and the 
early hazard for death. Approximately half of the 10,[ADDRESS_929430] for death was less, the association  was 
remained statistically significantly different from those who did not receive RBC transfusion throughout the 
follow -up period. Risk -adjusted reduction in survival for both early and late phases were (0.34 +/ - 0.02, P <.0001) 
and late phases (0.074 +/ - 0.016, P <0.0001).

 Patient centered outcomes are important measures of assessing the success of an operative procedure. We 
examined [ADDRESS_929432] of perioperative RBC transfusion in 7,321 cardiac surgical patients with the use of the 
Duke Activity Status Index (DASI). Functional recovery aft er cardiac surgery was significantly reduced in 
patients who received RBC transfusions perioperatively, even after adjustments for baseline DASI, preoperative 
clinical status, comorbidities, hematopoietic system measurements, laboratory values, operative f actors, surgical 
procedure and postoperative morbid events. Figure 4 displays the follow -up DASI scores for those who received 
and did not receive perioperative RBC transfusions. Figure 5 displays the empi[INVESTIGATOR_685603] -up DASI groups at each RBC by [CONTACT_685628] (yes/no) usage. As the number of RBC units increases, more 
patients were in the lowest DASI score group (0 -34.7) and fewer achieved the highest DASI score group (58.2). 
The predicted probability of achieving the highest foll ow-up DASI by [CONTACT_685629] 6. The predicted probability of achieving the highest follow -up DASI category decreases with 
increasing age and is further decreased with the addition of a blood transfusion.

 We recently tested the hypothesis that RBC transfusion increases the risk of postoperative atrial 
fibrillation in cardiac surgical patients  via modulating inflammation. In 5841 patients we were able to demonstrate 
that transfusion of RBC in the ICU was associated with a statistically significant increased risk for the 
development of new onset postoperative atrial fibrillation, odds ratio per unit transfused 1.18, confidence limits 
1.14, 1.23, P<0.0001.26  
 
 
Amendment 8  
05/17/[ADDRESS_929433] recently examined length of RBC storage duration on morbid outcomes from 
approximately 6000 transfused cardiac surgery patients from the Cleveland Clinic Heart Center. There were 2872 
patients who received exclusively RBC units <14 days and 3130 patients received units that were exclusively >14 
days storage duration. Morbid outco mes were prospectively collected on every patient. The blood bank was 
blinded to patient clinical status and specific operative procedure when assigning RBC units of particular storage 
duration. The allocation could be considered ‘random’ as is reflected b y an even distribution for a majority 
demographics, comorbidity, and operative factors among the 2 groups.  Patients whose RBC unit storage duration 
was >14 days verus <14 days had a higher incidence of in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34380]: 1.7% versus 2.8%, P=0.004; 
intubation morbidity: 9.7% vs 5.6%, P<0.001; renal failure: 2.7% vs 1.6%, P=0.003; septicemia / sepsis: 4.0% vs

22%, P=0.001, respectively. From a multiva riable logistic regression model on composite adverse outcome the 
maximum age of RBC units was significantly related to the composite outcome as was increasing number RBC 
units transfused and other important demographic variables and comorbidity. Figure 8.

D. Research Design and Methods:  
 
 We propose to provide an appropriate level of evidence for determining whether increasing length of 
storage of RBC impacts morbid outcomes following cardiac surgery.  We plan to study a large and diverse 
population so our results will be generalizable to most adults undergoing cardiac surgery.  
 
 Our aim is to d etermine whether length of red cell storage is related to adverse perioperative outcomes.  
 
Setting and Population  
 
 Cleveland Clinic Heart Center is a large tertiary care center and is among the busiest cardiac surgical 
centers in the US. Our annual volume  over the last 5 years for coronary artery by[CONTACT_15806], and valve 
procedures has been between 3500 -3790 surgeries. Transfusion of RBC currently occurs in approximately 40 -
50% of these patients.  
 
Inclusion Criteria  
 
 All primary and reoperative adult ca rdiac surgical patients undergoing cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_685630], coronary artery by[CONTACT_685631] a valve procedure, isolated valve procedures  
and ascending aortic aneurysm or dissection repair alone or combined with CABG and valve procedures.   
 
 
Exclusion criteria :  
 
 Age less than [ADDRESS_929434] 
devices, and those unwilling  to receive blood for religious reasons (Jehovah Witness).  
 
Protocol  
 
 Our pr imary aim is to determine whether increased length of storage of RBC is related to adverse 
perioperative outcomes.  
 
Study Intervention  
 
 Consecutive consenting patients who meet the inclusion criteria will be randomized to ‘age of blood’ less 
than two wee ks or greater than 20 days shelf life for all of the units allocated to the patient.  Red blood cell and 
component transfusion will follow management decisions of the care team. Adherence to the treatment protocol 
will be required for the patients in the o perating room, intensive care unit and postoperatively until discharge from 
the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  Good clinical judgment supersedes the protocol.    
 
Measurements  
 
Baseline Information : 
 
 Baseline demographics, laboratory values, comorbidity, surgical procedure, operative variables, and 
postoperative morbid events are contained in Appendix 1. (CRF).These variables are routinely prospectively 
collected by [CONTACT_685632]. These research registries have been approved by [CONTACT_685633].  Individual patient consent has been waived. Anesthesia automated record 
keepi[INVESTIGATOR_16816] (ARKS) currently stores all hemodynamic info rmation, intraoperative medication usage, arterial 
blood gas analyses, amount of crystalloid administered, time, number and identification number for RBC units 
transfused. Component blood product use and urine output are also automatically recorded and sto red within the 
automated system.

Primary Outcome  
 
 Major and minor composite outcomes are defined by [CONTACT_685634] (STS) definitions 
for postoperative events www.sts.org .  Major serious composite o utcomes include in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_39473], myocardial 
infarction, asystole, ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, tamponade, femoral or aortic dissection, renal failure, 
sepsis, respi[INVESTIGATOR_5448], pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, cerebral vascular acciden t, coma, 
gastrointestinal morbidity, deep sternal wound infection, multisystem organ failure, acute limb ischemia, return to 
the operating room for any one of the following: graft occlusion, valve dysfunction, or bleeding. Two additional 
major outcome vari ables prolonged postoperative ventilation and occurrence of atrial fibrillation occur with 
greater frequency and will be considered separately from the other major composite outcomes.  Minor composite 
postoperative morbid outcomes include urinary tract inf ection, superficial wound and leg harvest infection, 
complete heart block and transient stroke. These outcome measures are routinely collected as part of a data 
harvest for the STS database.  Length of intensive care unit and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_685606]. Appendix 1 
(CRF).  While considered as an expected outcome for the investigation, death and prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_685607]. Other expected 
outcome events are no t considered as SAE however will be reported at the annual renewal date.  
 
Statistical Analysis Plan  
 
 This trial is a single center, two -arm parallel design with two interventions: newer blood versus older 
blood. Patients randomized to the newer blood gro up will receive blood units that have been stored less than or 
equal to 14 days; patients randomized to the older blood group will receive blood units that have been stored more 
than or equal to [ADDRESS_929435] deviation, median and quartiles or frequency and 
percent, as appropriate. No two -sample tests on baseline variables are necessary, but those  that are believed to be 
strongly correlated with the outcomes will be included in the covariate adjustment in the primary and secondary 
analyses. The level of statistical significance used in the primary analysis will be 0.05, and all tests in the primary  
and secondary analyses are two -tailed. The statistical analysis will be performed using SAS 9.1 (SAS Institute, 
Cary, NC).  
 
 If a patient meets the inclusion criteria and gives consent, he/she could potentially be randomized in the 
trial. Before the star t of surgery, the research coordinator responsible for randomization will check the 
randomization list and determine that person’s randomization allocation. The coordinator will then contact [CONTACT_685635] -matched newer or older blood units available for that 
patient. Occasionally, there is short of supply of newer or older blood for a certain blood type. If the Blood Bank 
can not ensure that the patient receive only the kind of blood he/she is randomized to receive , that patient will be 
taken out of the trial and not randomized. We expect that this failure of randomization occurs infrequently, and it 
more likely occurs to patients with rare blood types. Since there is no evidence for an interaction between rare 
blood types and age of blood, this practice is not expected to introduce bias to the study. Another situation that 
may cause failure of randomization is that the patient may not need any transfusion for the entire hospi[INVESTIGATOR_685608]. In  that case the patient will also be taken out of the trial at hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]. We 
expect that about 40 -50% patients will not need any transfusion. This is a special kind of drop -out after 
randomization. However, since the droppi[INVESTIGATOR_685609], we do not believe it 
will introduce bias to the study, and the two treatment arms will still be balanced.  
 
 The primary analysis is a two -sided chi -square test comparing the two treatment groups on the rate of 
composite outcome, based on the intent -to-treat (ITT) principal. The 95% confidence interval of the rate of 
Amendment 8  
05/17/[ADDRESS_929436] the interaction between the treatment groups and the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]’ blood type, and donors’ 
blood type. In this way, we may identify subgroups more sensitive to the treatment. Although pre -specified, we 
will interpret the estimated interactions and their statistical signific ance with much caution due to multiplicity and 
they are not the primary analysis or focus. Our assessment of interactions will be viewed as exploratory and 
hypothesis generating.  
 
 
 
Sample Size Calculation and Sequential Monitoring  
 
 The sample size calcu lation is based on the primary analysis, which is a Chi -squared test comparing the 
proportion of composite outcome between the two randomized groups. We estimate that the unadjusted odds ratio 
of the composite outcome between older and newer blood groups i s 1.21 (25.9% vs. 22.4%). The adjusted odds 
ratio is 1.16 (95% confidence interval 1.01 -1.33). That result was from a comparison between age of blood less 
than [ADDRESS_929437] because we define the  older group 
as age of blood being longer than 20 days instead of 14 days. Therefore, for this sample size calculation we 
assume the odds ratio is 1.3. The overall proportion of composite outcome is estimated to be roughly around 30% 
in an observational da ta set from CVIR. These two assumptions lead to the estimated composite event rate of the 
newer blood group being 27.3% and that of the older blood group being 32.7%. If we set the type I error to be 
0.05 and power to be 0.85, the study would need to enrol l 1328  transfused  patients per treatment arm, for a total 
of 2656 patients with equal assignment. The total sample size could increase to 4810  transfused patients  if the 
odds ratio is 1.2 (32% vs. 28%), and it becomes 1600 if the odds ratio is 1.4 (33.5% v s. 26.5%).  
 
 We plan on three interim analyses at 25%, 50%, 75% of the accrual, plus the final analysis. Our 
calculations of group sequential boundaries assume non -binding stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_685610] (efficacy) and alternative hypothesis (futility). We use the gamma family spending function with gamma 
= -4 for efficacy and gamma = -2 for futility, which is between Pocock and O’Brien -Fleming approaches Figure 
9. We are thus spending beta somewhat faster than the alpha during the trial, allowing for early termination if 
there is little treatment group difference. The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_685611] 10 (on the scale of Z -
statistic of two -sample proportions test) and Table 1 (on the P value scale). The total sample size has t o be 
modified up a bit (n=2838) in order to properly account for the interim looks. Note that this is the maximum 
sample size for this study. Because the group sequential design makes it possible to terminate the study early for 
either efficacy or futility , the expected sample size is 2004 if the null hypothesis of no difference is true and it is 
2063 if the alternative hypothesis (27.3% vs. 32.7%) is true.

 We assume stable enrollment (uniform accrual) during the trial. Based on the number of cardiac surgeries 
conducted at the Cleveland Clinic each year, we estimate that it may take 2 -3 years to complete the enrollment. 
The clinical endpoint can usually be determined within 30 days after the operation. Therefore, the interim/final 
Amendment 8

(at least on e) boundary at each interim looks are calculated in Table 1. The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_685612].  
 
 In summary, we recommend that the study enroll a maximum of 2840 patients, w ith 1420 patients in each 
treatment arm in order to achieve 0.05 type I error and 0.85 power. The enrollment could take 2 -3 years. The

Strengths, Limitations and Significance  
 
Strengths  
 
 Cleveland Clinic Heart Center is among one of the largest cardiac surgical programs in the [LOCATION_002]. 
Our procedural volume couple d with the research infrastructure at the Cleveland Clinic will allow for us to 
perform this study with sufficient power within a time frame of approximately 2 -3 years. Our protocol will 
provide evidence -based medical guidelines for red cell storage durati on.  
  
Significance  
 
 Blood is a limited resource and should our findings indicate that older blood is detrimental,  current  blood 
inventory management strategies may need to be reconsidered. For example,  ‘first in, first out’ (FIFO) is presently 
considered  the responsible approach to managing a limited blood supply. The FIFO approach releases older red 
cell units first to prevent outdating of inventory and minimize the patient -care and financial impact of lost 
inventory.  It may be that a  ‘last in, first ou t’ (LIFO), which releases the  newest red cell units first, is more  
feasible in terms of inventory  management and patient outcome.  However, to maximize use of "young" blood,

Executive Committee  will be comprised of the experienced  clinical trialists.  The executive committee will 
evaluate overall  results  and adverse events  from th e proposal trial at six-month intervals, but more often if the

05/17/[ADDRESS_929440] demonstrate a high level of 
proficiency before being certified to  interview subjects. Procedures used to assure the integrity of data include: 
1) quarterly external audits by [CONTACT_685636]; 2)  data entry procedures following standard operating 
procedures (SOPs); and, 3)  data queries and resolution processes fo llowing SOPs. Frequent interaction among 
members of the study Executive Committee (PI, co -investigators, consultants), RAs and others as necessary, will 
maintain overall quality assurance. They will meet or have conference calls at least quarterly througho ut the data 
collection period, and as necessary thereafter.  
 Hard -copy forms will be stored in locked cabinets within a secured area. To protect electronic records and 
files against loss, duplicate files will be maintained and on Division of Anesthesiolog y servers at the Cleveland 
Clinic. These servers are highly secured because they already contain much patient -related information and are 
backed up daily to tape which is maintained in a remote location. The system meets all applicable HIPAA Privacy 
and Se curity rules. Access to the database and backups are strictly monitored according to need.  
 An initial training meeting before study enrollment and frequent meetings thereafter will ensure reliability 
and consistency in the use of diagnostic criteria and written standard operating procedures (SOPs). All data will 
be independently audited to confirm consistency among patient records, study data sheets and the main database. 
Data will be maintained on a custom -designed Filemaker or SQL relational database.  (CVIR, CTA Registry).  
 Upon completion of the trial and publication of the main results which will be provided to PubMed 
Central, the master data set will be de -identified to meet HIPAA requirements. The resulting limited data set will 
be published on the  Outcomes Research web site ( www.or.org ).

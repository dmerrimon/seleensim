More than 300,000 surgical repairs for RTC pathologies are performed annually in the [LOCATION_003], and the annual financial burden of RTC management was also estimated at $[ADDRESS_19645] been put forth over the years, outlining the management of pain-causing shoulder disorders.22–[ADDRESS_19646] causes of mild-to-moderate and gradual onset shoulder pain are treated initially with conservative care. Indeed, many recent studies and systematic reviews, as well as the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons guidelines, support that firstly the patient should be directed to a physical therapy (PT) program and not surgery. 26–30 For some specific conditions (e.g., symptomatic small to medium full-thickness RTC tears), strong evidence further supports that both PT and operative treatment attain significant improvements in patient-reported outcomes.[ADDRESS_19647]-CS-US-01 
Version: 1.4 Date: 10/08/[ADDRESS_19648]-effectiveness. Furthermore, the need for home-based digital solutions is now felt more acutely than ever, in the face of the current pandemic.34–36  In this context, solutions enabling home-based rehabilitation without requiring real-time human supervision can be key to improving effectiveness and lowering costs, while keepi[INVESTIGATOR_20788]. Indeed, there are studies demonstrating the potential37–[ADDRESS_19649]-effectiveness40 of shoulder postoperative care and rehabilitation through telehealth solutions.   However, while evidence is growing that digital therapeutics (DTx) can improve outcomes, personalize care and decrease costs,41 there is still much ground to be explored in the field of digital therapy following RCR.42,43 Several studies can be found on the validation/development of systems/algorithms for monitoring shoulder motion to assist clinicians on patient evaluation44,[ADDRESS_19650]. However, these are either in very preliminary stages of development or validation,47–[ADDRESS_19651] PhoenixÒ- which is an FDA-listed class II medical device. The company has previously conducted two pi[INVESTIGATOR_7602] ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) comparing a digital therapy program using this device against conventional face-to-face physical therapy. These studies have proven the feasibility, safety and effectiveness of this digital therapeutic on rehabilitation after total knee and hip arthroplasty.52–[ADDRESS_19652]-CS-US-01 
Version: 1.4 Date: 10/08/[ADDRESS_19653] Health’s Digital Care programs address the three pi[INVESTIGATOR_20789]: therapeutic exercise, patient education and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).   The exercise component is delivered through a digital feedback system - SWORD PhoenixÒ- which is an FDA-listed class II medical device. This device uses motion tracking technology to digitize motion and provide real-time biofeedback on performance during exercise execution (see more below). This allows individuals to perform independent exercise sessions at home without the need for constant face-to-face therapi[INVESTIGATOR_20790], while still being remotely monitored (asynchronously) through a cloud-based Portal. The safety and effectiveness of digital exercise programs performed with this device, in a home-based scenario, have already been demonstrated for recovery after total knee and hip arthroplasty.53–55 In these studies, where digital programs based on this device were compared with conventional PT, the clinical outcomes were superior in the digital group. These results were explained by (a) the positive impact of a kinematic biofeedback tool on patient performance, especially regarding error correction and stimulation of a greater range of motion; (b) patient empowerment regarding their rehabilitation process; (c) high patient engagement through the use of gamification strategies; (d) the positive effect of remote monitoring on patient effort and (e) the availability of objective data for clinical review, enabling data-driven decisions.  The education component is delivered through a smartphone app. Through this app, each individual is presented with educational content on their condition, in the form of small articles curated by [CONTACT_20813]’s clinical team, focusing on subjects ranging from anatomy and physiology, pain, exercise and fear avoidant behaviours.  The CBT component takes the form of an 8-week program based on third-generation CBT techniques, particularly Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction, Acceptance and Commitment 
SH-RCT-CS-US-01 
Version: 1.4 Date: 10/08/2020 4 Therapy and Compassion-based therapy. The program is presented to individuals through email, with links to short, pre-recorded, self-guided, meditation sessions, as well as written mindfulness exercises called “habit releasers”.  3. SYSTEM TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS  SWORD Phoenix® is a proprietary, 510(K) exempt, class I medical device, with CE mark, which is composed of the following three interconnected components:  § Motion trackers, placed on body segments using Velcro® straps. Each motion tracker is placed in a specific position. To assist in the correct placement of the motion trackers, both the trackers and the matching straps are color-coded. The motion trackers' setup varies according to each therapy.  § Mobile App, that comes pre-installed on a tablet, that guides the patient in each exercise session. Before each exercise, the patient is presented with a real-life video and audio explanation of that exercise. The execution interface is subsequently shown. This screen features: a) a progress bar; b) a repetition counter; c) a star counter and d) a timer displaying time left in the exercise. A correct repetition is defined as a movement starting at the baseline and reaching or surpassing the specified target, without violating movement or posture constraints. In case the patient violates a constraint, a message is prompted showing which movement error was performed, so that the patient can correct the movement in the following attempts. For each correct repetition, the patient earns from 1 to 5 stars, depending on the range of motion of that specific movement in comparison to normative values for that movement. At the end of each session, the patient is presented with a summary of the number of completed repetitions and stars, as well as with badges rewarding him for the progresses achieved in each exercise.  § Web-based Portal that allows the clinical team to generate new patient profiles and create exercise sessions for each patient. To prescribe a session, the clinician needs to select the exercises, number of sets and number of repetitions.  When a patient performs a session, the results are uploaded to the platform and available for review. Based on this information, the clinical team can edit the parameters of each exercise according to patient performance and progress.

STUDY HYPOTHESIS The digital program will be associated with at least the same outcomes as conventional PT.  7. STUDY DESIGN Prospective, single-center, parallel-group, randomised controlled study.  8. STUDY OUTCOMES  8.[ADDRESS_19659] on physical function and symptoms measured through the shortened Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire (QuickDASH) between baseline and [ADDRESS_19660]-CS-US-01 
Version: 1.4 Date: 10/08/2020 7 8.2 Secondary Outcomes The secondary outcomes will include the following:  a) Impact on shoulder range of motion Shoulder range of motion will be measured in the following exercises: shoulder flexion; shoulder abduction and external shoulder rotation at 90 degrees of abduction.  b) Impact on Pain Measured through the following question: “On a scale of [ADDRESS_19661] 24 hours?”  c) Interest in undergoing surgery Measured through the following question: “On a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 is not at all and 10 is extremely interested, how interested are you in undergoing shoulder surgery in the next 12 months”?  d) Medication consumption Measured through the following questions:  i. “Are you taking any medication for your shoulder pain?”;  ii.  “If yes, on how many days in a week, on average, are you taking medication for your shoulder pain"  e) Impact on fear avoidance beliefs Measured by: [CONTACT_19045]-reported questionnaire (Fear Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire- FABQ)  f) Impact on anxiety and depression Measured by [CONTACT_20817]-7 scale and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 scale  g) Impact on work productivity and activity impairment  Measured through Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire: Specific Health Problem v2.0 (WPAI:SHP)  
SH-RCT-CS-US-01 
Version: 1.4 Date: 10/08/2020 8 h) Satisfaction with social roles and discretional social activities Measured through the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Computerized Adaptive Test (PROMIS-CAT) scales: Ability to participate in social roles and activities (version 2.0) and satisfaction with social roles and activities (version 2.0).  i) Patient engagement Measured through:  g.1) adherence to exercise sessions; g.2) drop-out rates; g.3) treatment intensity (i.e. total number of exercise minutes)  j) Patient satisfaction Measured through the Net Promoter Score, by [CONTACT_20818]: “On a scale from 0 to 10, how likely are you to recommend this program to a friend or colleague?”  9. SAMPLE SIZE ESTIMATION Sample size estimation calculations were performed taking into consideration the primary outcome measure – the QuickDASH. In a sample of [ADDRESS_19662] Health’s medical device in the context of work-related conditions, the mean and standard deviation of the QuickDASH scale at baseline was of 59 and 19 points respectively. A Minimal Detectable Difference (MDD) of 11.2 points was considered, based on the psychometric properties of the scale.56 Considering a power of 80%, a two-sided 0.05 significance level and a 10% dropout rate, 80 (40+40) patients would be necessary to detect a 11.2 points difference between the two groups.   10. INCLUSION/EXCLUSION CRITERIA  a.  Inclusion Criteria a) Subjects aged between 18 and 80 years of age at enrolment b) Reporting intermittent or persistent shoulder pain for at least 6 weeks, and/or present at least 50% of the time in the past 6 months c) Lack of visual/audio or cognitive impairment interfering with the ability to understand or comply with the program

Exclusion Criteria a) Non-English speaking b) Residing outside greater SF area c) Known pregnancy d) Submitted to spi[INVESTIGATOR_20792] 3 months ago e) Symptoms and/or signs indicative of possible infectious disorder f) Referred pain from spi[INVESTIGATOR_20793]/or thoracic outlet syndrome g) Active cancer diagnosis or undergoing treatment for cancer h) Cardiac, respi[INVESTIGATOR_20794] 20 minutes of light to moderate physical activity i) Concomitant neurological disorder (e.g. stroke, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease) j) Dementia or psychiatric disorders precluding patient from complying with a home-based exercise program k) Illiteracy and/or serious visual or auditory impairment interfering with communication or compliance  Additionally, any patient undergoing a PT program for shoulder pain will be required to stop ongoing programs to enroll in the study.  11. CANDIDATE IDENTIFICATION AND PROCEEDINGS  Patient recruitment will primarily be done through the use of UCSF electronic health record (EHR) recruitment services from the Clinical and Translational Service Institute (CTSI) to assist with targeting and identification of potentially eligible participants. As an “honest broker” of the EHR data, the service is designed to protect patient privacy and offer more efficient way to recruit eligible participants that meets the study’s inclusion/exclusion criteria. The cohort of patients scheduled to receive physical therapy services will be identified and pre-screened by [CONTACT_20819]’s criteria. Once patients have been identified, they are flagged from their appointments for physical therapy services at the UCSF Outpatient Patient Faculty, and will be evaluated in-person as part of their regular initial scheduled visit (i.e. evaluation visit). At the time of this visit, potential participants will be assessed by [CONTACT_8355]-investigators to also ensure that participants meet the cognitive and mental capacity 
SH-RCT-CS-US-01 
Version: 1.4 Date: 10/08/2020 10 requirements. Once the criteria are met, investigator will present the study and invite the patient to participate and provide consent. The participant’s screening survey data will be collected and be randomized to one of the two arms, coordinated by [CONTACT_9137]. All study-related information will be stored by [CONTACT_20820] (EDC) system.   To centralize all study-related information, a commercially available electronic data capturing (EDC) system will be used.   Following the identification of a potential candidate, the investigator will enter the EDC portal and fill the screening survey. If the patient is eligible (i.e. meets inclusion criteria and does not have any exclusion criteria) the investigator will present the study and invite the patient to participate and provide consent.  12. PROCESS OF CONSENT  The study will be presented verbally to potential participants by a study investigator, in a face-to-face meeting. Adequate time will be allowed for the candidate to clarify any doubts about the study, following which the eConsent form will be sent through the EDC platform to the participant and investigator, for signature. The study consent form (Annex 1) will then be signed by [CONTACT_20821], and stored in the EDC platform.  13. ALLOCATION & BLINDING  Patients will be randomly allocated to one of two groups, using random permuted blocks of 6. After eConsent collection, the investigator will enter the EDC portal and proceed with randomisation (also built into the EDC). Following randomisation, the investigator will contact [CONTACT_20822]. Blinding of investigators and patients regarding allocation arm will not be possible, given the nature of the intervention. Analysis of study results will be performed by [CONTACT_20823].  
SH-RCT-CS-US-01 
Version: 1.4 Date: 10/08/2020 11  14. INTERVENTION   a. Digital program Patients in the digital intervention group will benefit from an 8-week program composed of therapeutic exercise, education and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) program provided by [CONTACT_20824]. These patients will be referred to SWORD Health by [CONTACT_20825]. SWORD Health will then assign a physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_20795]. The physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_20796].  Patients in this group will performed home-based rehabilitation sessions using SWORD Phoenix®, under remote monitoring by a physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]. Participants will be provided with a tablet computer with a SWORD mobile app installed, along with two inertial motion trackers (each comprised of a gyroscope, an accelerometer and a magnetometer) to be placed on chest, upper arm and wrist, respectively. These trackers enable precise movement quantification, feeding the mobile app, which guides the patient through the session, providing video and audio instructions before each exercise, as well as real-time audio and video biofeedback during the exercise. On the other end, the clinical teams are allowed to remotely monitor results and prescribe/edit exercise sessions through a web-based portal.    The exercise component will follow the protocol outlined in Annex 2, which can however be adapted by [CONTACT_20826][INVESTIGATOR_20797]. Participants will be asked to start with three 20 min sessions per week, building gradually to three 30 min sessions per week. Participants will not be excluded from the study in case of lower adherence, but will not be included in the per-protocol analysis if they perform less than 21 sessions over the course of 8 weeks.  Participants in this group will be considered as dropouts if they: a) choose to abandon the study; b) do not engage in any exercise session for at least fourteen consecutive days.  The educational component will be delivered automatically through a smartphone app (available for iOS and Android), and will take the form of small educational texts that will be released 
SH-RCT-CS-US-01 
Version: 1.4 Date: 10/08/[ADDRESS_19663] to the participant, during the 8 weeks of the program. Each email will contain an introductory text describing the objectives for that week, as well as a link to that week’s audio session and a PDF attachment with self-guided exercises. The CBT component is not mandatory per protocol, but metrics on user engagement will be measured.    b. Conventional PT  Patients in this group will benefit from a 8-week program consisting of two [ADDRESS_19664] to the specific needs of the participant.  Participants in this group will be excluded from the per protocol analysis if they complete less than 14 sessions over 8 weeks. Participants in this group will be considered as dropouts if they: a) choose to abandon the study; b) miss four consecutive scheduled PT sessions.  In addition to the face-to-face sessions, PTs will also be communicating with participants in this group through a secure messaging system (Mychart) used at UCSF or, alternatively, through a telephone check-ins (10-15 min calls, up to twice per week).   15. PARTICIPANT ASSESSMENTS  Patients will be assessed at baseline, [ADDRESS_19665]-CS-US-01 
Version: 1.4 Date: 10/08/2020 13 This assessment will involve a face-to-face visit, where the following information will be collected: a) date of birth b) gender c) height & weight d) body mass index e) formal education (years of schooling) f) job type g) previous shoulder surgery (> 3 months ago) h) Working status i) Geocodes/zip  j) Race/ethnicity  k) Age  The following outcomes will also be assessed in this visit: a) Shoulder Range of Motion; b) PROMIS CAT measures.  Shoulder Range of Motion will be measured in the following movements: 1) shoulder flexion; 2) shoulder abduction; 3) external rotations with shoulder abducted at [ADDRESS_19666]-CS-US-01 
Version: 1.4 Date: 10/08/2020 14 for protocol breach in case they don’t fill in the assessment forms. Upon completion of the baseline form, participants in the study will receive a stipend of $25.  Additional measurements of upper limb function and tri-dimensional motion will also be performed at the onsite visit by [CONTACT_15370], using a motion capture system. These will not be considered in the outcomes of this study, but will be made available for post-hoc analysis.   Interim assessment (4 weeks) Participants will be required to complete a questionnaire similar to the baseline assessment, within a 5-day window beginning at the start of week 4. These assessments will include all the information pertaining to the primary and secondary outcomes, except for those that are collected through a face-to-face assessment. These (shoulder range of motion and PROMIS CAT measures) will not be collected on this assessment. Upon completion of this form, participants in the study will receive a stipend of $25.  Final assessment (8 weeks)  This assessment will involve a face-to-face visit, where the following outcomes will be assesed: a) shoulder Range of Motion; b) PROMIS CAT measures and c) Participant satisfaction (Net Promoter Score). Shoulder Range of Motion and PROMIS CAT measures will be assessed using a similar methodology to the one descried for the baseline assessment.  Participants will also be required to complete a questionnaire similar to the baseline and interim assessments, within a 5-day window beginning at the start of week 4. These assessments will include all the information pertaining to the primary and secondary outcomes, except for those that are collected in the face-to-face visit. Upon completion of this form, participants in the study will receive a stipend of $25.

Version: 1.4 Date: 10/08/[ADDRESS_19667]-hoc analysis.   Engagement assessment  For participants on the digital group, engagement and usage metrics of the educational and CBT components will also be collected automatically.  Additionally, the following activity log will be collected from patient’s Electronic medical records and time stamps, as well as paper survey (or, in the case of the digital group, sent to the study coordinator via email, with the participant identified only by [CONTACT_20827]), to be entered into EDC portal by [CONTACT_2420]: 1. Face-to-face visits registry (dates, times and duration) 2. Remote sessions registry (dates, times and duration) 3. Number and duration of contacts between PT and participant (emails, text messages, phone and videocalls) 4. Total time spent on remote monitoring of the patient (digital group only)  Adverse events In any event during the course of the study if subjects experience adverse effects of both internal (on-site) and external (off-site) events, a prompt reporting to the UCSF Human Research Protection Program (HRPP)/institutional review board (IRB) and to the sponsor of the study will take place. This includes any unanticipated problems involving risk to subjects noted in the study. The safety plan in IRB will contain protocol to help with communication and procedures that are in place to monitor and report adverse events should they occur. The investigators will accurately document causality assessment to their best knowledge and follow-up of all definite, probable, or unrelated adverse events to the study and safety-related information.   Care continuity To ensure that quality of care is not compromised throughout the study, all subjects from both 
SH-RCT-CS-US-01 
Version: 1.4 Date: 10/08/[ADDRESS_19668] or Mann–Whitney U test will be used for quantitative variables. For categorical variables, Chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test will be used.  Outcome analysis will be performed using both an intention to treat analysis and a per-protocol analysis.  The overall impact of the intervention on the primary and secondary outcomes will be assessed considering both the results at the 8-week assessment as well as change from baseline.  Differences between interventions will be evaluated using independent samples t test or Mann-Whitney U test. For non-normally distributed variables, the magnitude of the difference in the medians will be assessed using Hodges-Lehman estimator. Additionally, a repeated measures ANOVA will also be performed, with group as an independent factor and time as a within-subjects factor. When necessary, logarithmic transformation will be performed to obtain normally distributed variables. In all analysis, a significant level of 0.[ADDRESS_19669]-CS-US-01

 15  The co-investigators are encouraged to use the McClure's staged based rehabilitation therapy (STAR) classification (see Table 1) as a guide but not necessarily as a prescriptive manner to select interventions. Instead, the co-investigators will reference their use interventions categorized based on commonly practiced in an outpatient physical therapy setting (see Table 2).  McClure's stage-based rehabilitation therapy (STAR) intervention approach is based on the Irritability of the patient's condition. Assessments of symptoms of Irritability are gathered from the patient's history and findings from the examination. Table 1 represents a guided approach to STAR for the chronic shoulder pain population and the type of interventions used. Table 2 describes the type of commonly used physical therapy interventions that could be used in the cohorts.   Guideline to help determine the stage of Irritability is based on both history and examination findings*  High Moderate Low • Pain >= 7/10  • Consistent night or resting pain  • Pain before end of range  • AROM < PROM • High disability   • Pain (4-6/10) • Intermittent night or rest pain  • Pain at end of range  • AROM and PROM close • Moderate disability  • Pain (<= 3/10) • Absent night or rest pain  • Minimal pain with overhead  • AROM = PROM  • Low disability  Approach: Minimize physical stress  • Activity modification  Approach: Mild-moderate physical stress  • Basic-level functional activity restoration  Approach: Mod-high physical stress  • High-demand functional activities  *Taken from Staged approach (STAR) for rehabilitation classification by [CONTACT_20833].

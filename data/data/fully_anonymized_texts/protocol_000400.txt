Although Yttrium-90 (Y90) radioembolization (RE) is an established therapy in patients

6 | Page  with unresectable HCC, it has variable response due to many internal and external factors, including tumor histology and vascularity. A critical factor predicting tumor response (TR) is delivery of tumoricidal dose to targeted lesions. Optimizing individualized Y90 dosimetry will likely improve targeted TR and survival, while minimizing lung and liver toxicity. Technetium-99m macroaggregated albumin (99mTc-MAA) is currently used as the primary radiotracer for shunt studies prior to Y90 RE. However, 99mTc-MAA falls short in accurately predicting Y90 biodistribution in the liver and lung after RE. By [CONTACT_615854] Y90-microspheres as the radiotracer for pre-treatment shunt study, our goal is to address an unmet public health need by [CONTACT_615855]-Y90 therapy through prospective personalized dosimetry. We hypothesize that using low dose Y90 microspheres as the treatment planning radiotracer will allow accurate prediction of therapeutic Y90 liver biodistribution, which will enable us to perform prospective personalized dosimetry for every individual patient.  The results of this study will determine the safety and efficacy of using low dose Y90 as a direct surrogate for treatment planning to ensure delivering cytotoxic Y90 dose to the targeted tumor(s), while concomitantly minimizing liver and lung toxicity with more accurate prediction of therapeutic Y90 biodistribution. Our long-term objective is to increase the likelihood of objective tumor response, prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with HCC treated with Y90 RE. Objectives:  Primary Objective:   Compare the safety and accuracy/efficacy of low dose Y90 resin microspheres and MAA in predicting the actual dose delivered to the tumor, liver, and lung after Y90 therapy. Secondary Objectives: 1. Optimize low dose Y90 techniques in predicting TNR and LSF. 2. Identify tumor dose response thresholds (TDRT) and tumor dose distribution in patients with HCC treated with Y90 resin microspheres.  Endpoints: Primary Endpoint:  The lung shunt fraction (LSF) and tumor to normal liver activity ration (TNR). Secondary Endpoints:  1. Monitoring all grades of Y90 related toxicity

Description of Study Intervention: In this study, patients with HCC who are found to be ideal candidates for HCC and who would fit our inclusion criteria, described below, will be recruited. Patients will undergo standard of care mappi[INVESTIGATOR_615828] 99TC-MAA to plan for Y90 radioembolization therapy. The additional, non-standard of care, intervention will be to do a second mappi[INVESTIGATOR_615829]-dose Y90 (15 mCi) before the therapeutic Y90 radioembolization. The distribution of MAA in terms of lung shunt fraction (LSF) and tumor to normal liver activity ration (TNR) will be compared to that of low-dose Y90. The treatment planning will be performed using standard of care MAA biodistribution using partition dosimetry model. After administration of therapeutic Y90 dose, the actual dose delivered to tumor, non-tumoral liver (NTL) and lungs will be compared to the dose predicted by [CONTACT_615856]-dose Y90. The patients will be the followed-up clinically and with imaging at 1, 3 and 6 months to determine tumor response, potential treatment related toxicity and to determine TDRT.

INTRODUCTION   2.1 Study Rationale   Less than 20% of patients with HCC are eligible for curative surgical resection in the [LOCATION_002], with a 5-year survival of 18%[1]. Y90 therapy has demonstrated efficacy in HCC as both palliative therapy and bridge to “definitive therapy” such as transplantation by [CONTACT_615857] #: RAD4784 Version Date: Aug 22, 2019  
11 | Page  locoregional disease control[2]. However, multiple factors affect objective TR to Y90 RE, including appropriate cytotoxic dose delivery to the targeted tumors[3, 4]. A direct dose-response relationship exists between delivered Y90 dose to the tumoral and normal non-tumoral liver (NTL), TR and hepatic toxicity[5-12]. Improvements in PFS and OS have been shown to occur in patients achieving objective TR across the majority of primary and metastatic liver tumors treated with Y90 RE[5, 6, 8, 9, 13-24]. These findings imply that the determination of tumor-specific dose response thresholds and optimization of tumor dose delivery while minimizing NTL dose will likely further improve post Y90 RE outcome. However, reported TDR thresholds predicting objective TR vary widely, not only by [CONTACT_615858], reflecting differential tumoral radiosensitivity, but also within the same tumor types and under similar conditions[17-19, 25]. Additionally, reported TDR thresholds in HCC for resin and glass microspheres are significantly different[7, 26]. Furthermore, both glass and resin Y90 microspheres demonstrate heterogeneity in distribution and absorbed radiation when delivered intra-arterially[27, 28]. Autoradiographic and pathologic analysis of patients with HCC treated with Y90 demonstrated a tendency for Y90 RE material to localize along the tumor periphery[27, 28]. Given that Y90 is a pure beta emitter with short tissue penetration of 2.5mm, absorbed radiation dose at the center of large tumors can be as low as 20 Gy, while the periphery of the tumor can receive >230 Gy[27-29]. Numerous factors are presumably responsible for such phenomenon, including tumor vascular density, flow dynamics, number of particles administered and clustering of particles. Of note, distribution of the particles and absorbed radiation is more homogenous in NTL compared to tumors, likely due to organized vasculature[27-29].   The above observations suggest that the use of mean absorbed dose for the entirety of the tumor is inaccurate for determining TDR because a single small area of microsphere concentration may spuriously suggest that a tumoricidal dose has been achieved. We believe that wide ranges in previously reported TDR thresholds are largely explainable by [CONTACT_615859], the inadequacy of currently employed Y90 RE dosimetric techniques in addressing the complex interactions between the tumor microvasculature, RE devices (glass vs. resin) and resulting radioactive microsphere biodistribution[7, 30]. Other factors including the indirect and continuous Bremsstrahlung radiation spectrum detected on SPECT and alteration in flow biomechanics by [CONTACT_615860][7].     Manufacturer recommended Y90 RE dosimetry models include empi[INVESTIGATOR_29121] (set dose of radiation delivered to liver lobe regardless of tumor type) and a variation of the body surface area method which can additionally factor in tumor volume as determined by [CONTACT_12783]-sectional imaging[31, 32]. Not only do these methods rely on variables that poorly correlate to absorbed dose prediction and Y90 microsphere biodistribution, they also fail to consider the highly unique tumor micro- and macro-environment. To date, the partition model is the most studied personalized dosimetry model, requiring the determination of MAA uptake TNR during the shunt study using

12 | Page  SPECT/CT[33]. In the partition model, MAA is assumed to mirror Y90 biodistribution and to distribute uniformly within the liver tumor and NTL, but at different concentrations. Such assumptions facilitate calculation of Y90 doses separately for the tumor and NTL which can be used to plan treatments based on dose limits that are thought to minimize pulmonary and hepatic toxicities[33, 34].   While the assumption of MAA mirroring the Y90 microsphere biodistribution has long been suspected to be inaccurate, only recently has its impact on dosimetry been quantified, with especially compelling data sourced from the current reference standard post-Y90 PET/CT, comparing the actual Y90 absorbed dose to that estimated from the MAA[19, 25, 27]. MAA has been shown to be an inaccurate estimator of LSF and Y90 biodistribution in the liver due to several factors, including size discrepancy between MAA and Y90 microspheres, as well as free pertechnetate overestimating LSF[35-37]. MAA consistently overpredicts LSF, sometimes by [CONTACT_7809] 100%, and has a poor linear correlation with directly measured LSF using Y90 PET (correlation coefficient: 0.682)[25]. Conversely, MAA underpredicts TNR compared to that obtained on post Y90 SPECT and PET, with a wide range of linear coefficient ranging from 0.7-0.9[8, 25]. Furthermore, retrospective direct Y90 tumor dose measurement using PET and SPECT after Y90 therapy, while resource intensive, has limited clinical benefit, since patients are rarely retreated if “inadequate” dose is delivered to tumor[8, 25]. Hence, there is a critical need to ensure the desired dose is estimated accurately in a prospective fashion prior to administration of the therapeutic Y90.  These problems can be overcome by [CONTACT_2329] a radioactive tracer in pre-treatment planning that is bioidentical to Y90 microspheres, which is the principle behind shunt study and treatment with Holmium-166 microspheres (166Ho)[38]. Currently, 166Ho is not available in the [LOCATION_002], and low-dose Y90 microspheres are the most readily available direct surrogate to predict LSF and tumor dose. Similar to the use of low-dose [ADDRESS_816489] Y90 RE outcomes under currently recommended indications but will also better allow accurate study of further indications. Additionally, LSF is a major determinant in the calculation of a safe Y90 dose as LSF > 20% is a relative contraindication to Y90 RE. Hence, it is possible that patients with inaccurately high LSF’s estimated by [CONTACT_615861] Y90 therapeutic doses or are entirely excluded from treatment, thus adversely impacting post-Y90 outcomes.  In summary, there is growing evidence that factoring individual patient characteristics into Y90 treatment planning are likely to significantly impact both TR and treatment tolerability. To this end, the partition model, while more resource intensive, has made great strides towards treatment individualization. However, the use of MAA in predicting post Y90 RE absorbed dose and

13 | Page  biodistribution is flawed and inaccurate, leading to suboptimal dose delivery, unnecessary hepatotoxicity and poor outcomes. Therefore, we propose low-dose Y90 microspheres for therapy planning, as an alternative to MAA, to be a bioidentical therapeutic Y90 surrogate marker to better predict and thus achieve optimal therapeutic dosing. Our long-term goal is to improve TR, PFS, and OS while reducing potential associated toxicities in patients treated with Y90 RE.  2.2 Background  2.2.1 Clinical experience  A) A 68-year-old male with a solitary caudate lobe HCC measuring 6.[ADDRESS_816490]. The patient’s baseline CT and MRI findings were concerning for high LSF due to opacification of hepatic veins and IVC on arterial phase of the scans. His lung shunt fraction using MAA was 44%. He was brought back to the IR and a shunt study using low-dose (9.1 mci) resin microspheres was performed. The planar bremsstrahlung LSF was measured at 29% (Figure 1A). The therapeutic Y90 dose was modified to ensure lung dose of <30Gy from both low and therapeutic dose Y90 RE’s. The patient was then successfully treated with 29.6 mci of resin microsphere from the same catheter location that low-dose Y90 was administered. Repeat planar bremsstrahlung images were obtained and LSF was measured at 31% (Figure 1B). More importantly, the liver biodistribution of low and therapeutic dose Y90 depi[INVESTIGATOR_615833]/CT were also similar (Figure 1C&D). This clinical example confirms significant overestimation of Y90 LSF using MAA and also illustrates the feasibility of identifying clinically significant LSF’s using planar Y90 bremsstrahlung.  B) A 37-year-old female with chemo-refractory metastatic breast cancer to the liver was referred to IR for Y90 radioembolization by a multidisciplinary tumor board. Her LSF on MAA shunt study was 4.3%. After resin Y90 RE therapy, planar and SPECT/CT bremsstrahlung scans were obtained. Y90 LSF after RE was less than 1% using scatter correction method and 12.1 % without scatter correction (Figure 2). This case demonstrates the need for quantitative techniques if Y90 bremsstrahlung is to be used for LSF calculation.

14 | Page  2.2.2 Correlative Studies Background  An anthropomorphic torso phantom with lung and liver compartments (Data Spectrum Corporation, Durham, North Carolina) was used to assess low-dose imaging capabilities with Y90 (Figure 1). Initially, 10.[ADDRESS_816492] a true LSF of 7.5% and a TNR of 10. The phantom was imaged using our planar imaging protocol for shunt calculations and with our SPECT/CT protocol for Y90. Energy windows were chosen for quantitative Y90 Bremsstrahlung imaging. Planar imaging (as clinically used for the MAA shunt studies) yielded 6.4% LSF. On the other hand, SPECT calculation of the lung shunt was 6.9%. SPECT/CT depi[INVESTIGATOR_615834] 6. The PET/CT images on the other hand had very few counts in both the liver and lungs due to the small number of positron emissions by [CONTACT_6398]-dose Y90. Nevertheless, the TNR measured by [CONTACT_615862] 10 and the LSF was measured at 4.9%. As depi[INVESTIGATOR_615835], each imaging modality in the setting of low-dose Y90 have advantages and disadvantages. While PET appears to be accurately measuring TNR, Bremsstrahlung SPECT appears to be more accurate in estimating LSF. Our goal through the proposed study is to ultimately optimize and validate low-dose Y90 PET and/or SPECT as the single study needed to accurately plan Y90 therapy based on institutional availability.   2.3 Potential Risks and Benefits   Potential Risks:  As with any Y90 radioembolization, the potential risks involved includes liver failure, non-target embolization resulting in stomach or duodenum/proximal jejunum inflammation or ulceration. Additionally, radiation induced lung disease is a potential risk of Y90 radioembolization. With accurate mappi[INVESTIGATOR_615836], which is standard of care, the risk of either liver failure, non-target embolization or radiation induced lung disease are significantly less than 1%. Related to angiography, there is risk of vascular injury and bleeding either at the access site or at the celiac access or SMA (in case of replaced or accessory right hepatic artery). The risk of clinically significant vascular injury or bleeding requiring another intervention is less than 1%.  Additional angiographic and low dose CT scans of the PET/CT and SPECT/CT in this study also involve ionizing radiation with risk factors primarily related to increased chance of cancer Figure 1 shows images used in the phantom analysis: A) Planar (static image), B) SPECT coronal, C) CT coronal, D) PET coronal.

Potential Benefits:  More accurate treatment planning with low-dose Y90 can result in maximizing dose delivery to the tumor while minimizing radiation dose to the non-tumoral liver and lungs.

The patients will be the followed-up clinically and with imaging at 1, 3 and 6 months to determine tumor response, potential treatment related toxicity and to determine TDRT.  Hypothesis: Low dose Y90 microspheres as the treatment planning radiotracer will allow more accurate prediction of therapeutic Y90 liver biodistribution, which will enable us to perform prospective personalized dosimetry for every individual patient.  The results of this study will determine the safety and efficacy of using low dose Y90 as a direct surrogate for treatment planning to ensure delivering cytotoxic Y90 dose to the targeted tumor(s), while concomitantly minimizing liver and lung toxicity with more accurate prediction of therapeutic Y90 biodistribution. Our long-term objective is to increase the likelihood of objective tumor response, prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with HCC treated with Y90 RE.  The study is a single-arm in study in which each patient will undergo two sets of mappi[INVESTIGATOR_615837] Y90 therapy. One with standard of care 99Tc-MAA and one with low-dose (15 mCi) Y90 microspheres. Therefore, the additional intervention in the study is the second mappi[INVESTIGATOR_615838]-dose Y90 microspheres. Each patient will be used as their internal control to minimize selection biases. Additional to standard of care Y90 SPECT/CT after therapy, the patient will undergo one PET/CT after low-dose Y90 and one PET/CT after Y90 therapy.  The study is a single center (Emory) single site study. For the convenience of patients and in order to obtain additional PET/CT’s on the same day as the mappi[INVESTIGATOR_6926] Y90 therapy on a state-of-the-art PET scanner, all mappi[INVESTIGATOR_615839]. This study is a single arm phase II prospective clinical trial in which patients with HCC who are deemed suitable for Y90 radioembolization will be recruited. Patients will undergo standard of care mappi[INVESTIGATOR_615828] 99TC-MAA to plan for Y90 radioembolization therapy. The additional, non-standard of care, intervention will be to do a second mappi[INVESTIGATOR_615829]-dose Y90 (15 mCi) before the therapeutic Y90 radioembolization.  The distribution of MAA in terms of lung shunt fraction (LSF) and tumor to normal liver activity ration (TNR) will be compared to that of low-dose Y90. The treatment planning will be performed using standard of care MAA biodistribution using partition dosimetry model.  After administration of therapeutic Y90 dose, the actual dose delivered to tumor, non-tumoral liver (NTL) and lungs will be compared to the dose predicted by [CONTACT_615856]-dose Y90.

STUDY INTERVENTION    7.1 Agent Administration (or Study Intervention Administration)  7.1.1 Study Intervention Description  The low-dose Y90 (15 mCi), will remain the same for all the patients. As explained in section 4.3, this dose ensures adequate imaging on both SPECT and PET without the risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_615840].   The therapeutic dose of Y90 will be calculated using the partition model detailed below based MAA biodistribution in the tumor, non-tumoral liver and the lungs.   7.1.2 Dosing and Administration  Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis.  Reported adverse events and potential risks are described in Section 7.  Appropriate dose modifications are described in Section 8.  No investigational or commercial agents or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_37342]'s malignancy.  No dose escalation or dose expansion is planned in this procedure.   The treatment Y90 dose will be calculated using the partition model as detailed below:  The required therapeutic Y90 dose will be calculated using MAA SPECT, Y90 SPECT and Y90 PET. Although all [ADDRESS_816501] (the standard of care) will be used for actual treatment planning. The activities calculated using Y90 SPECT and PET will be used for post-hoc analysis. Partition model to achieve cytotoxic Target Tumor Dose of >100 Gy will be utilized using the following formulas[7]:   1) Desired Tumor Activity (GBq) = (100 Gy X Tumor Mass (Kg)) / 50 2) Targeted Normal Liver Activity (GBq) = Desired Tumor Activity (GBq) / TNR 3) Targeted Liver Lobe Activity (GBq) = (Targeted Normal Liver Activity + Desired Tumor Activity) (GBq) 4) Targeted Liver Lobe Dose (Gy) = Targeted Liver Dose Activity (GBq) X 50 / Liver mass (Kg) The liver and tumor mass will be determined using the volumes calculated by [CONTACT_615867] 1.03 g/cm3 [39]. It will be ensured that targeted liver dose remains below 50 Gy which has been shown to be safe with no sequela of radiation induced liver disease while ensuring the target tumor dose >100 Gy[7, 26].

26 | Page  general, concomitant medications and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_217905] (e.g. such as anti-emetics, anti-diarrhea) and safety of the patient are allowed.       • Medications to prevent or treat nausea or vomiting. • Anti-diarrheal medications (e.g., loperamide) for patients who develop diarrhea. • Pain medication to allow the patient to be as comfortable as possible. • Treatment with bisphosphonates or denosumab for pre-existing, painful bone/liver metastases, and limited-field palliative radiotherapy or surgery is permitted. Patients requiring initiation of such treatment during the course of the study must be evaluated for disease progression; radiotherapy like any concomitant medication must be listed on the CRF.   • Immunosuppressive agents to treat suspected irAEs • Hematopoietic colony-stimulating growth factors (e.g. G-CSF, GM-CSF, M-CSF), thrombopoietin mimetics or erythroid stimulating agents as per local or published guidelines; in case of anemia, thrombocytopenia or neutropenia, potential immune mediated etiology should be ruled out • Nutritional support or appetite stimulants (e.g. megestrol). • Oxygen therapy and blood products or transfusions. • Inactivated vaccines.  • The patient must be told to notify the investigational site about any new medications he/she takes after the start of the study drug. All medications (other than study drug) and significant non-drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (including physical therapy, herbal/natural medications and blood transfusions) administered during the study must be listed on the Concomitant Medications.    7.3.[ADDRESS_816506] not receive other antineoplastic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (e.g. investigational drugs, devices, chemotherapy, immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) or any other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_447233].  However, limited-field palliative radiotherapy may be allowed as concomitant therapy (see above).  The use of systemic steroid therapy and other immunosuppressive drugs is not allowed except for the treatment of infusion reaction, irAEs, and for prophylaxis against imaging contrast dye allergy, standard pre-medication for chemotherapy or replacement-dose steroids in the setting of adrenal insufficiency (providing this is < 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent), or transient exacerbations of other underlying diseases such as COPD requiring treatment. If systemic corticosteroids are required for the control of infusion reactions or irAEs, it must be tapered and be at non-immunosuppressive doses (< 10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent) before the next administration of study treatment. If the dose of prednisone or equivalent cannot be reduced to less than 10 mg/day before the administration of next dose of study treatment then the study agent must be discontinued. The use of live vaccines is not allowed through the whole duration of the study. Inactivated vaccines are allowed. There are no prohibited therapi[INVESTIGATOR_77983]-treatment follow-up period.    7.3.3 Rescue Medications & Supportive Care   Patients whose treatment is interrupted or permanently discontinued due to an adverse event or clinically significant laboratory value, must be followed up at least once a week (or more frequently if required by [CONTACT_15931], or if clinically indicated) for [ADDRESS_816507] be

27 | Page  followed up for adverse events and serious adverse events until start of new antineoplastic medication or 150 days after discontinuation of study drug, whichever is sooner.  Suspected SAEs will continue to be collected beyond the 150-Day safety visit. This will be done by [CONTACT_615870], laboratory checks, and phone calls. The emergence of Immune-Related AE (irAE) may be anticipated based on the mechanism of action of immunomodulatory therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Serologic, histologic (tumor sample) and immunological assessments should be performed as deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_447302]-related nature of the AE and to exclude alternative explanations. Recommendations have been developed to assist investigators in assessing and managing the most frequently occurring irAEs.   7.4 Duration of Therapy  In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse event(s), patients will be treated and followed for [ADDRESS_816508] of care at Emory IR. This will generally continue until patient’s death, enrollment in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_615842]-up. If there is tumor progression at 3 months, patient may ensue other liver directed or systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].   In the event of a patient’s withdrawal, the Investigator will make every effort to complete the End of Treatment procedures specified in the Schedule of Events.  
 Treatment Beyond Progression   In this study, patient will only be treated once unless the entire tumor is covered by [CONTACT_133069] Y90 radioembolization therapy. In that case, the patient will undergo a second Y90 therapy in 4 weeks assuming eligibility criteria are maintained. If there is tumor progression at 3 months, patient may ensue other liver directed or systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].   7.5 Duration of Follow Up  Patients will be followed for approximately 180 days after Y90 therapy according to the SoA’s detailed above to determine both safety and efficacy.  The patients will then be followed every [ADDRESS_816509] of care at Emory IR. This will generally continue until patient’s death, enrollment in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_615842]-up.   Long-term follow-up should continue until the patient’s withdrawal of consent or loss to follow up, death, or study termination. In case of a clinically significant AE, patient will be followed for safety until resolution or permanent sequelae of all toxicities attributable to study drug(s). If the patient discontinues study drug for a clinically significant AE, the patient will be followed until resolution of the AE or the event is considered to be stable and/or chronic.  A participant will be considered lost to follow-up if he fails to return for three scheduled visits and is unable to be contact[CONTACT_615871].  
Winship Protocol #: RAD4784 Version Date: Aug 22, 2019  
28 | Page  The following actions must be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required study visit: • The site will attempt to contact [CONTACT_615872]/or should continue in the study. • Before a participant is deemed lost to follow-up, the investigator or designee will make every effort to regain contact [CONTACT_6635] (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if necessary, a certified letter to the participant’s last known mailing address or local equivalent methods). These contact [CONTACT_13140]’s medical record or study file.  • Should the participant continue to be unreachable, he will be considered to have withdrawn from the study with a primary reason of lost to follow-up.  7.6 Discontinuation of Study Intervention Discontinuation from low-dose Y90 mappi[INVESTIGATOR_615843], and remaining study procedures should be completed as indicated by [CONTACT_4690].  If a clinically significant finding is identified (including, but not limited to changes from baseline) after enrollment, the investigator or qualified designee will determine if any change in participant management is needed. Any new clinically relevant finding will be reported as an adverse event (AE). Patients may choose to discontinue the trial at any time, for any reason, and without prejudice to further treatment.  The EOT visit will occur [ADDRESS_816510] dose of the radiopharmaceutical administration.   Reasons for EOT are:  • PD in the absence of clinical benefit as determined by [CONTACT_737]. • Occurrence of a clinically significant AE found to be unacceptable or non-resolution of clinically significant AEs for > 6 weeks.  • Symptomatic deterioration.  • Achievement of maximal response.  • Noncompliance of the patient with protocol-mandated procedures based on the judgment and agreement of both the Investigator and Sponsor.  • Continued participation is no longer in the patient’s best interest in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689].  • Withdrawal of consent.   Patient remain on treatment phase until discontinuation of all study drugs, In the event of a patient’s withdrawal, the Investigator will promptly notify the Sponsor and make every effort to complete the EOT procedures specified in the Schedule of Events. The reason for participant discontinuation or withdrawal from the study will be recorded on the Case Report Form (CRF). Subjects who sign the informed consent form and are assigned but do not receive the study intervention may be replaced.  Subjects who sign the informed consent form, and are assigned and receive the study intervention, and subsequently withdraw, or are withdrawn or discontinued from the study, will not be replaced.

An investigator may discontinue or withdraw a participant from the study for the following reasons: • Pregnancy • Significant study intervention non-compliance  • If any clinical adverse event (AE), laboratory abnormality, or other medical condition or situation occurs such that continued participation in the study would not be in the best interest of the participant • Disease progression which requires discontinuation of the study intervention • If the participant meets an exclusion criterion (either newly developed or not previously recognized) that precludes further study participation • Participant unable to receive Y90 therapy The reason for participant discontinuation or withdrawal from the study will be recorded on the Case Report Form (CRF). Subjects who sign the informed consent form and are randomized but do not receive the study intervention may be replaced.  Subjects who sign the informed consent form and subsequently withdraw, or are withdrawn or discontinued from the study will be replaced. 8. STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES  All patients will undergo baseline liver mass protocol abdominal MRI without and with contrast within [ADDRESS_816512] will be calculated using two different methods: 1. Mean dose of the entire tumor resulting in objective TR; 2. Determination of % tumor volume receiving >[ADDRESS_816513] calculation is to take into account the non-homogeneity of Y90 dose delivered to the tumors previously reported.[27, 28]  TDR threshold based on logistic regression will be determined by [CONTACT_6283]. Kokabi and Risk.    Additional scan assessments may be collected based on clinical symptoms, as appropriate. Documented tumor measurements are required using CT scans, MRI, physical examination, and/or digital photography, as appropriate.  Any imaging used to assess disease at any time point will be submitted for an independent radiology review. The same method of assessment (CT or MRI and/or digital photography) and the same technique for acquisition of images must be used for all

30 | Page  study assessments (contrast must be used unless medically contraindicated).  Baseline imaging should be done at the same institution/facility which will be used to measure response during the patient’s participation in the study.  Radiographic assessments and efficacy analyses will be conducted by [CONTACT_615873].  8.1 Schedule of study procedures  Before study entry, throughout the study, and following study drug discontinuation, various clinical and diagnostic laboratory evaluations are outlined.  The purpose of obtaining these detailed measurements is to ensure adequate safety and tolerability assessments.  Clinical evaluations and laboratory studies may be repeated more frequently if clinically indicated.  The Schedules of Assessments during the screening and treatment period is provided following the Protocol Synopsis.   Screening Phase Screening procedures will be performed up to 14 days prior to enrollment and initiation of Y90 therapy as applicable, except for baseline imaging (up to 28 days allowed) unless otherwise specified.  All subjects must first read, understand, and sign the IRB/REB/IEC-approved ICF before any study-specific screening procedures are performed.  After signing the ICF, completing all screening procedures, and being deemed eligible for entry, subjects will be enrolled in the study.  Procedures that are performed prior to the signing of the ICF and are considered standard of care may be used as screening assessments if they fall within the screening window.  The following procedures will be performed during the Screening Visit: • Informed Consent • Review of eligibility criteria • Medical history and demographics • Complete physical exam  • ECOG Performance Status • Vitals signs, weight and height  • Review of prior/concomitant medications  • Imaging by [CONTACT_4654]/MRI • Clinical laboratory tests for: o Hematology  o Complete Metabolic Panel (CMP)  o Coagulation (PT, PTT, INR) o Creatinine Clearance o Serum or urine pregnancy test (for women of childbearing potential)

A 2.8 Fr microcatheter will be advanced to the right or left hepatic artery branch supplying the targeted HCC lesion(s). From this location, detailed evaluation of hepatic arterial vasculature using conventional angiography and 3D cone beam CT (CBCT) will be performed to ensure complete perfusion of the targeted tumor(s) and absence of visible non-target embolization. If a potential non-target vessel (i.e. gastroduodenal or right gastric artery) is observed, the vessel will be embolized using coils. From the catheter location where CBCT was performed, [ADDRESS_816515] not experienced any accidental dislodgment during patient transport/waiting. The patient will be then transferred to nuclear medicine department for 99mTc MAA planar and SPECT/CT of the chest and abdomen.  C. 99mTc MAA Planar and SPECT/CT of chest and abdomen (Monday) Planar and SPECT/CT of chest and abdomen will be obtained with low energy filter according to our standard clinical protocol at Emory.

Galt will oversee the extraction of the low dose by [CONTACT_615874]. The patient will be brought back to IR on the same day (Monday). Using the technique detailed above, the same hepatic artery branches where MAA injection was performed will be selected. From this location, 15 mCi of resin Y90 microspheres will be administered. After the procedure, patient’s femoral sheath will be removed and hemostasis will be achieved with manual compression or closure device. If procedure performed via radial access, which is more commonly performed currently at Emory, the radial sheath will stay in and removed according to IR protocol after Y90 SPECT/CT.  The remainder of the activity will be used for therapy on Wednesday/Thursday of the same week depending on the desired dose. The patients will be then transferred to nuclear medicine department for planar and SPECT/CT bremsstrahlung imaging of the chest and abdomen on the same day.  E. Low-dose Y90 Planar and SPECT/CT of chest and abdomen (Monday) Quantitative reconstruction of Y90 bremsstrahlung SPECT/CT will follow the procedures outlined by [CONTACT_615875][41].When low dose Y90 bremsstrahlung follows administration of Tc-99m on the same day, the procedures of Siman et al have to be adapted by [CONTACT_615876] a minimum energy of [ADDRESS_816517] and adapted energy windows[41].  Please note that this is commonly performed at Emory for our out of town or international patients in whom both mappi[INVESTIGATOR_6926] Y90 therapy is performed on the same day. Since only the proportion of activity in each compartment (i.e. tumor, liver and lung) are needed to calculate dose delivered in the setting of known administered activity, filter any energy less than 160 keV will result in accurate quantification of Y90 dose delivered. Additionally, patient will undergo PET/CT on the same day using a state-of-the-art PET scanner which will only detect Y90 activity without any noise from MAA. This will be used as an additional step to confirm our hypothesis that same MAA and Y90 is feasible.  The patient will then be discharged from IR after removal of the radial sheath according to our standard protocol.   F. Low-dose Y90 PET/CT of chest and abdomen (Monday) The patient will then undergo time of flight Y90 PET/CT with one or two bed positions depending on the patient’s size. This will also occur on the same day and at the same location as the remainder of mappi[INVESTIGATOR_615848].

K. Y90 Therapy Tumor, Liver, and Lung Dose Calculation (Friday)  
Utilizing the MIM software, post Y90 therapy PET/CT data and partition method described 
above, the mean actual dose delivered to the tumor, normal liver, and lung will be calculate d 
by [CONTACT_6283]. Sethi and Kokabi. The software will generate ROIs from the inside to the periphery 
of the tumor based on Y90 delivery, and Dose Volume Histograms (DVH) plotting the delivered dose as a function of liver volume. Using DVH, % of tumor volume receiv ing 
>100Gy and dose range to the tumor will be also calculated.

All required procedures may be completed within ± [ADDRESS_816520] discontinued treatment due to toxicity in the absence of confirmed progressive disease are provided in the Schedule of Event.    All subjects will be followed for survival until the end of the study regardless of further treatments, or until the sponsor ends the study. 8.2 Description of study procedures  Medical history Findings from medical history (obtained at screening) and physical examination shall be given a baseline grade according to the procedure for AEs. Increases in severity of pre-existing conditions during the study will be considered AEs, with resolution occurring when the grade returns to the pre-study grade or below.  Physical examination Physical examinations should be conducted according to the Schedule of Events.  Full physical examinations should be conducted at screening/baseline, day of mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007], day of Y90 therapy and beyond, and EOT (evaluate all major organ systems, including the following categories:  general, head, eyes, heart, lungs, abdomen, extremities, neurologic, and psychiatric). Other examinations may be focused, at the discretion of the Investigator, to identify changes from baseline or evaluate changes based on the patient’s clinical symptoms.  Weight is to be reported at each visit, height at screening/baseline visit only.    Vital signs Vital signs (blood pressure [BP], pulse, temperature, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487]) will be evaluated according to the assessment schedules.  Body weight is also recorded along with vital signs.

MEASUREMENT OF EFFECT   Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using m-RECIST [42].   9.[ADDRESS_816521] Criteria   At baseline, tumor lesions/lymph nodes will be categorized as measurable or non-measurable as described in the following subsections.  For the purposes of this study, patients should be re-evaluated for response at 1, [ADDRESS_816522] their response classified according to the definitions stated below.  (Note:  Patients who exhibit objective disease progression prior to the completion of study could be considered for alternate therapy after documentation of PD at 3 months.)  Disease Parameters  Measurable disease.  Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as ≥[ADDRESS_816523] x-ray or as ≥[ADDRESS_816524] be recorded in millimeters (or decimal fractions of centimeters). 
Winship Protocol #: RAD4784 Version Date: Aug 22, 2019  
39 | Page   Note:  Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiated area might or might not be considered measurable.  If the investigator thinks it appropriate to include them, the conditions under which such lesions should be considered must be defined in the protocol.  Malignant lymph nodes.  To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph node must be ≥[ADDRESS_816525] scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline and in follow-up, only the short axis will be measured and followed.  Non-measurable disease.  All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (longest diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 to <15 mm short axis), are considered non-measurable disease.  Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, and abdominal masses (not followed by [CONTACT_462]), are considered as non-measurable.  Note:  Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non-measurable) since they are, by [CONTACT_108], simple cysts.  ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non-cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target lesions.  Target lesions.  All measurable lesions up to a maximum of [ADDRESS_816526] lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be selected.  Non-target lesions.  All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable lesions over and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence, absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted throughout follow-up.   Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers.  All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.  
Winship Protocol #: RAD4784 Version Date: Aug 22, 2019  
40 | Page  The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up.   Multiphase Liver Mass Protocol CT and MRI:  Liver mass protocol MRI is the preferred imaging modality in this study. This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_816527] slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness.   FDG PET/CT: PET/CT is not an ideal modality for evaluation HCC at baseline or after therapy.  Ultrasound:  Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used as a method of measurement.  Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their entirety for independent review at a later date and, because they are operator dependent, it cannot be guaranteed that the same technique and measurements will be taken from one assessment to the next.  If new lesions are identified by [CONTACT_12153], confirmation by [CONTACT_12154].  If there is concern about radiation exposure at CT, MRI may be used instead of CT in selected instances.  Tumor markers:  Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response.  If markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  
 Tumor response evaluation  To assess objective response or future progression, it is necessary to estimate the overall tumor burden at baseline and use this as a comparator for subsequent measurements.  Measurable disease is defined by [CONTACT_12155]. When more than one measurable lesion is present at baseline, all lesions up to a maximum of [ADDRESS_816528] 1.1 [42]. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be selected. Pathological nodes which are defined as measurable and may be identified as target lesions must meet the criterion of a short axis of ≥ [ADDRESS_816529] scan.  Only the short axis of these nodes will contribute to the baseline sum.  All other pathological nodes (those with short axis ≥ 10 mm but < 15 mm) should be considered non-target lesions.  Nodes that have a short axis < 10 mm are considered non-pathological and should not be recorded or followed. If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then as noted above, only the short axis is added into the sum.  The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to further

All other lesions (or sites of disease) including pathological lymph nodes should be identified as non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements are not required and these lesions should be followed as ‘present’, ‘absent’, or in rare cases ‘unequivocal progression’.  For assessment of abscopal response, any of the target lesions identified at baseline will be measured and followed for abscopal response.  This target lesion should not be a target of injection or biopsy.  The abscopal response is defined as a shrinkage of ≥ 20% from baseline in any target non-manipulated metastatic lesion identified at baseline.  Evaluation of Target Lesions  Complete Response (CR):  No intramural arterial enhancement in all target lesions.  Partial Response (PR):  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of viable (enhancement in the arterial phase) target lesions.   Progressive Disease (PD):  At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of viable target lesions.  Stable Disease (SD):  Features classifiable as neither partial response nor progressive disease.    Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions  Complete Response (CR):  No intramural arterial enhancement in all target lesions.  Partial Response (PR):  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of viable (enhancement in the arterial phase) target lesions.   Progressive Disease (PD):  At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of viable target lesions.  Stable Disease (SD):  Features classifiable as neither partial response nor progressive disease.   Although a clear progression of “non-target” lesions only is exceptional, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_36408], and the progression status should be confirmed at a later time by [CONTACT_463] (or Principal Investigator).  9.1.[ADDRESS_816530] response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).

Note:  Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as “symptomatic deterioration.”  Every effort should be made to document the objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment.

43 | Page  Duration of Response  Duration of overall response:  The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR until the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented.   Duration of stable disease:  Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started, including the baseline measurements.   Progression-Free Survival  PFS is defined as the time from the date of first dose to the date of the first objectively documented progressive disease per m-RECIST or death, whichever is earlier.  Patients who do not have the date of disease progression per m-RECIST or date of death will be censored on the date of the last evaluable tumor assessment.  Patients who started a new antineoplastic regimen prior to disease progression per m-RECIST will be censored on the date of the last evaluable tumor assessment prior to receiving the new antineoplastic regimen.  Patients whose disease progression or death appears after missing two consecutive tumor assessments will be censored on the date of the last evaluable tumor assessment.  Patients who are lost to follow up will be censored on the date of their last evaluable tumor assessment. PFS will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.  The median and its 95% CI, along with the 25% and 75% quartiles will be summarized for all treated patients. OS will be defined as the date of first dose to the date of death.  Patients who do not have a date of death will be censored on the last date for which the patient was known to be alive.  OS will be analyzed similarly to PFS.  Response Review  All responses will be reviewed by [CONTACT_13461](s) independent of the study simultaneously as the results become available.

STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  10.1 Study Design/Endpoints Primary Objective Endpoints:  A) Accuracy/Efficacy: The accuracy/efficacy of MAA as a predictor of therapeutic Y90 distribution will be compared to that of low-dose Y90.  H0: Y90 will have the same LSF as MAA.  HA: Y90 will have significantly less LSF than MAA.   H0: Y90 will have the same TNR as MAA.  HA: Y90 will have significantly higher TNR than MAA.   B) Safety: adverse events related to Y90 radioembolization and angiography will be document by [CONTACT_5292], clinical laboratory test and cross-sectional imaging.  No statistical consideration applied to the safety portion of the primary end point as it is a single arm study in which every patients undergo both mappi[INVESTIGATOR_615850]-dose Y90. Detailed safety analysis plan is outlined below in section 10.5.   10.2 Sample Size/Accrual Rate  Based on previously published data by [CONTACT_27156], we assume mean (SD) LSF of 11.66% (10.2) for HCC using MAA[43]. Assuming LSF in low-dose Y90 is 50% lower than what is predicted by [CONTACT_615878] 0.[ADDRESS_816531], n=30 achieves 80% power with α=0.05. This assumption is based on several previously published studies including the work presented by [CONTACT_615879] Y90 LSF by [CONTACT_615880] 100% [25, 35-37]. Assuming mean (SD) TNR of 5.4 (2.1) using MAA is 30% lower than low-dose Y90, the power achieved with n=30 is greater than 99% [8, 25].   Emory University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_615851]. Annually, 150 HCC patients who may be transplant/surgical or palliative therapy candidates are referred to interventional radiology (IR) at Emory for liver directed therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Assuming a conservative accrual rate of 30%, we predict an enrollment of n=30 patients in 6-8

In the event that a patient drops out either after being consented or after having a part of the study completed, a new patient will be recruited.  10.[ADDRESS_816532] were used instead. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to measure the correlation between two numerical variables, and the significance of coefficients were tested using Wald’s test.  The primary endpoints are LSF and TNR for accuracy efficacy of the treatment. In the primary analyses, LSF and TNR will be estimated and compared between the two groups (MAA vs Y90) using two sample student’s paired t-test. General linear model (GLM) will be further used in the multivariable analysis to estimate the adjusted efficacy of treatment (MAA vs Y90) on LSF and TNR after adjusting for other factors, respectively.  10.4 Analysis of Secondary Endpoints 1.

Regardless of relationship, all AEs will be recorded with start dates occurring any time after patient receives Y90 until 7 (for non-serious AEs) or 100 days (for SAEs) after the last day of study participation. At each study visit, the investigator will inquire about the occurrence of AE/SAEs since the last visit. Events will be followed for outcome information until resolution or stabilization.  Any medical condition that is present at the time that the participant is screened will be considered as baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if the study participant’s condition deteriorates at any time during the study, it will be recorded as an AE. Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event at each level of severity to be performed. AEs characterized as intermittent require documentation of onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].  The maximum grade for each type of toxicity will be recorded for each patient, and frequency tables will be reviewed to determine toxicity patterns. Adverse events will be summarized and described within each cohort. They will initially be reviewed regardless of attribution, but also whether they are possibly, probably, or definitely related to treatment. In addition, we will review all adverse event data that are graded as 3, 4, or 5 and classified as either “unrelated” or “unlikely to be related” to study treatment in the event of an actual relationship developi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. The incidence of severe adverse events or toxicities will be described. We will assess the proportion of patients who experience grade 3 or higher non-hematologic toxicity. To assess tolerability, we will also capture the proportion of patients who go off treatment due to adverse events.   10.5.1 Baseline descriptive statistics  The following baseline descriptive statistics will be performed:  1. Mean and Median Age and standard deviation 2. Frequency of Male vs. Female 3. Frequency of underlying cause of cirrhosis: Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, Alcohol, NASH, others, no cirrhosis. 4. Mean and Median maximal tumor diameter for index tumor with standard deviation 5. Mean and Median number of lesions with standard deviation  10.5.2 Planned interim analyses (if applicable)  N/A  10.5.3 Analysis of efficacy endpoints  Responders will be defined as those that achieve partial response (PR). CR rate will be calculated with an exact 95% confidence interval, both within cohorts but not between cohorts. CR rate will be calculated among eligible patients who are evaluated for response at the 90-day and 180-day assessments; patients who fail to have a response assessment due to early progression or death will also be considered evaluable for response and categorized as non-responders.   
Winship Protocol #: RAD4784 Version Date: Aug 22, 2019  
47 | Page  Patients who fail to have a response assessment for other reasons (e.g., refusal due to travel constraints) will be considered unevaluable and will not be included in the denominator when calculating CR rate. Patients will be analyzed in the cohort to which they were enrolled.  The number and percentage of subjects experiencing objective response will be descriptively summarized overall and by [CONTACT_9084].  Frequencies and percentages will be used to summarize these endpoints.   10.5.4 Analysis of secondary endpoints   Secondary clinical endpoints will be evaluated to assess outcomes including biology of resistance and survival. The endpoints with their definitions are listed as follows:  1. Tumor Dose Response Threshold (TDRT): defined as the Y90 dose that results in CR or PR 2. Tumors with LD 50 and LD 70: Defined at frequency of tumors in which 50% or more or 70% or more of their volume received above TDRT and their correlation with response.  3. Time to progression (TTP): defined as the time from start of protocol therapy until the criteria for disease progression are met.  Patients who are either lost to follow-up, die or who begin alternative treatments prior to progression, will have their data censored as of the date considered to be lost to follow-up, date of death, or the first day of alternative therapy.   4. Progression-free survival (PFS): defined as the time from start of protocol therapy to disease progression or death from any cause, censoring patients without an event at time of last clinical assessment.  5. Overall survival (OS): defined as the time from start of protocol therapy to death, censoring patients who are alive at last follow-up  Protocol therapy related toxicities rate will be summarized using descriptive statistics such as frequencies and proportions. Differences in the proportion of patients who experience protocol-related toxicities will not be compared between cohorts.   To compare TDRT and Tumors with LD [ADDRESS_816536] will be used instead. General linear model (GLM) will be further used in the multivariable analysis to estimate the adjusted efficacy of treatment (MAA vs Y90) on TDRT and Tumors with LD 50 and LD 70 after adjusting for other factors, respectively. Pearson correlation coefficients will be calculated to measure the correlation between two numerical variables, and the significance of coefficients will be tested using Wald’s test.  Time to event outcomes including TTP, PFS and OS will be evaluated using the methods of Kaplan and Meier, with a focus on graphical evaluation as well as early time-point and median estimates of survival distributions with 95% confidence intervals. The TTP, PFS and OS of each patient group at specific time points, such as 1 year, 3 years, and 5 years, etc. were also estimated alone with 95% CI. Cox proportional hazards models were further used in the multivariable analyses to assess adjusted effects of treatment (MAA vs Y90) on the patients’ TTP, PFS and OS after

All data management and statistical analysis were conducted using SAS Version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina).     11. ADVERSE EVENTS:  LIST AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS   Adverse event (AE) monitoring and reporting is a routine part of every clinical trial.  The following list of AEs and the characteristics of an observed AE will determine whether the event requires expedited reporting in addition to routine reporting.  11.[ADDRESS_816537] of reported and/or potential adverse events (AE) associated with an agent using a uniform presentation of events by [CONTACT_6764].    Adverse Event List(s) for Y90 Radioembolization with Resin Microsphere [31]: • Any procedure where the skin is penetrated carries a risk of infection. The chance of infection requiring antibiotic treatment appears to be less than one in 1,000. • There is a very slight risk of an allergic reaction if contrast material is injected. • Any procedure that places a catheter inside a blood vessel carries certain risks. These risks include damage to the blood vessel, bruising or bleeding at the puncture site, and infection. The doctor will take precautions to mitigate these risks. • There is a risk that the microspheres may lodge in the wrong place, putting the patient at risk for an ulcer in the stomach or duodenum. This happens in approximately 2% of patients. • There is a risk of infection after radioembolization, even if an antibiotic has been given. • Because angiography is part of the procedure, there is a risk of an allergic reaction to the contrast material. • Non-Target Delivery of SIR-Spheres microspheres: Inadvertent delivery of SIR-Spheres microspheres to extra-hepatic structures such as the esophagus, stomach, duodenum, gallbladder or pancreas may result in radiation injury to these structures. Meticulous angiographic technique must be employed to prevent the non-target delivery of SIRSpheres microspheres to any extra-hepatic structures. • Radioembolization Induced Liver Disease (REILD): Delivery of excessive radiation to the normal liver parenchyma may result in REILD – see description in Section 7. The risk of REILD may also be increased in patients with pre-existing liver disease. Consideration should be given to reducing the prescribed activity of SIRSpheres microspheres in the following clinical settings1 : • Reduced liver functional reserve due to steatosis, steatohepatitis, hepatitis or cirrhosis • Elevated baseline bilirubin level • Small tumor

The lung radiation dose must be limited to ≤ 30 Gy.  11.2 Definition of Adverse Events (AE) Adverse event means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of an intervention in humans, whether or not considered intervention-related (21 CFR 312.32 (a)). 11.3 Definition of Serious Adverse Events (SAE)   An adverse event (AE) or suspected adverse reaction is considered "serious" if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  • Death • Life-threatening adverse event  • Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] • A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  • Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. (Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse). 11.4 Classification of an Adverse Event  11.4.1 Severity of Event  For adverse events (AEs) not included in the protocol defined grading system, the following guidelines will be used to describe severity.  • Mild – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the participant’s daily activities.  • Moderate – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning. • Severe – Events interrupt a participant’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life-threatening or incapacitating.  Of note, the term “severe” does not necessarily equate to “serious”.  11.4.2 Relationship to Study Intervention 
Winship Protocol #: RAD4784 Version Date: Aug 22, 2019  
50 | Page   All adverse events (AEs) must have their relationship to study intervention assessed by [CONTACT_61186]/her clinical judgment. The degree of certainty about causality will be graded using the categories below. In a clinical trial, the study product must always be suspect.    • Definitely Related – There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and other possible contributing factors can be ruled out. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, occurs in a plausible time relationship to study intervention administration and cannot be explained by [CONTACT_9153]. The response to withdrawal of the study intervention (dechallenge) should be clinically plausible. The event must be pharmacologically or phenomenologically definitive, with use of a satisfactory rechallenge procedure if necessary. • Probably Related – There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and the influence of other factors is unlikely. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, occurs within a reasonable time after administration of the study intervention, is unlikely to be attributed to concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals, and follows a clinically reasonable response on withdrawal (dechallenge). Rechallenge information is not required to fulfill this definition. • Potentially Related – There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g., the event occurred within a reasonable time after administration of the trial medication). However, other factors may have contributed to the event (e.g., the participant’s clinical condition, other concomitant events). Although an AE may rate only as “possibly related” soon after discovery, it can be flagged as requiring more information and later be upgraded to “probably related” or “definitely related”, as appropriate. • Unlikely to be related – A clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, whose temporal relationship to study intervention administration makes a causal relationship improbable (e.g., the event did not occur within a reasonable time after administration of the study intervention) and in which other drugs or chemicals or underlying disease provides plausible explanations (e.g., the participant’s clinical condition, other concomitant treatments). • Not Related – The AE is completely independent of study intervention administration, and/or evidence exists that the event is definitely related to another etiology. There must be an alternative, definitive etiology documented by [CONTACT_15370].  11.4.[ADDRESS_816538]. Schuster, the Co-investigator, will be responsible for determining whether an adverse event (AE) is expected or unexpected.  An AE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with the risk information previously described for the study intervention.

Conditions that were already present at the time of informed consent should be recorded in the Medical History page of the patient’s CRF/worksheet.  Adverse events will be assessed and graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0. Grade [ADDRESS_816540] for an adverse event, the severity of mild, moderate, severe, and life-threatening, death related to the AE corresponding respectively to Grades 1 - 5, will be used. Information about any deaths (related to an Adverse Event or not) will also be collected through a Death form (or EOT/SEC/Survival Information in NOVDD). The occurrence of adverse events should be sought by [CONTACT_105]-directive questioning of the patient (patient) during the screening process after signing informed consent and at each visit during the study. Adverse events also may be detected when they are volunteered by [CONTACT_102] (patient) during the screening process or between visits, or through physical examination, laboratory test, or other assessments. As far as possible, each adverse event should be evaluated to determine:  1. The severity grade (CTCAE Grade 1-5)  2. Its duration (Start and end dates)   3. Its relationship to the study treatment (Reasonable possibility that AE is related: No, Yes) or Its relationship to the study treatment (Reasonable possibility that AE is related: No, Yes, investigational treatment, Yes, the study treatment (non-investigational), Yes, both and/or indistinguishable)  4. Action taken with respect to study or investigational treatment (none, dose adjusted, temporarily interrupted, permanently discontinued, unknown, not applicable)  5. Whether medication or therapy was given (no concomitant medication/non-drug therapy, concomitant medication/non-drug therapy)  6. Whether it is serious, where a serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as in Section 9.[ADDRESS_816541] been met (include for NCDS trials)   Outcome (not recovered/not resolved, recovered/resolved, recovering/resolving, recovered/resolved with sequelae, fatal, unknown)     If the event worsens the event should be reported a second time in the CRF noting the start date when the event worsens in toxicity. For grade 3 and 4 adverse events only, if improvement to a lower grade is determined a new entry for this event should be reported in the CRF noting the start date when the event improved from having been Grade 3 or Grade 4.   For phase I studies any AE

52 | Page  that constitutes a DLT should be reported like a grade 3 and 4 adverse event.  All adverse events should be treated appropriately. If a concomitant medication or non-drug therapy is given, this action should be recorded on the Adverse Event CRF.  Once an adverse event is detected, it should be followed until its resolution or until it is judged to be permanent, and assessment should be made at each visit (or more frequently, if necessary) of any changes in severity, the suspected relationship to the study treatment, the interventions required to treat it, and the outcome. Progression of malignancy (including fatal outcomes), if documented by [CONTACT_206852] (for example, as per RECIST criteria for solid tumors), should not be reported as a serious adverse event.  Adverse events separate from the progression of malignancy (example, deep vein thrombosis at the time of progression or hemoptysis concurrent with finding of disease progression) will be reported as per usual guidelines used for such events with proper attribution regarding relatedness to the drug. Laboratory abnormalities that constitute an Adverse event in their own right (are considered clinically significant, induce clinical signs or symptoms, require concomitant therapy or require changes in study treatment), should be recorded on the Adverse Events CRF.  Laboratory abnormalities, that do not meet the definition of an adverse event, should not be reported as adverse events. A Grade 3 or 4 event (severe) as per CTCAE does not automatically indicate a SAE unless it meets the definition of serious as defined below and/or as per investigator’s discretion.   11.5.[ADDRESS_816542] be submitted on an SAE form and assessed by [CONTACT_976] [INVESTIGATOR_515550], IRB, DSMC, FDA or Sponsor.   All SAEs will be followed until satisfactory resolution or until the site investigator deems the event to be chronic or the adherence to be stable. Other supporting documentation of the event may be requested by [CONTACT_8704]. The study sponsor will be responsible for notifying FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction as soon as possible but in no case later than 7 calendar days after the sponsor's initial receipt of the information.

 An SAE occurring at a different time interval or otherwise considered completely unrelated to a 
previously reported one should be reported separately as  a new event.  
 
Any SAEs experienced after the reporting period described above should only be reported to FDA/IRB if the investigator suspects a causal relationship to the study treatment.    
 Information about all SAEs is collected and recorded on the Serious Adverse Event Report 
Form; all applicable sections of the form must be completed in order to provide a clinically thorough report. The investigator must assess and record the relationship of each SAE to each 
specific study treatment (if there is more  than one study treatment), complete the SAE Report 
Form, and submit the completed form.   Each reoccurrence, complication, or progression of the original event should be reported as a 
follow-up to that event regardless of when it occurs. The follow -up information should describe 
whether the event has resolved or continues, if and how it was treated, whether the blind was broken or not, and whether the patient continued or withdrew from study participation.  
 All SAE must be recorded on a MedWatch 3500 Form. SAE reports and any other r elevant safety

CFR Part 312) 
NOTE:  Investigators MUST  immediately report ANY Serious Adverse Events, whether 
or not they are considered related to the investigational agent(s)/interv ention (21 CFR 
312.64) 
An adverse event is considered serious if it results in ANY of the following outcomes:  

Winship Protocol #: RAD4784 Version Date: Aug 22, 2019  
55 | Page    1) Death 2) A life-threatening adverse event  3) An adverse event that results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1328] ≥ 24 hours  4) A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions  5) A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  6) Important Medical Events (IME) that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. (FDA, 21 CFR 312.32; ICH E2A and ICH E6).  ALL SERIOUS adverse events that meet the above criteria MUST be immediately reported to the Sponsoring IRB/FDA within the timeframes detailed in the table below.

Winship Protocol #: RAD4784 Version Date: Aug 22, 2019  
56 | Page  A secondary malignancy is a cancer caused by [CONTACT_437] a previous malignancy (e.g., treatment with investigational agent/intervention, radiation or chemotherapy). A secondary malignancy is not considered a metastasis of the initial neoplasm.  All secondary malignancies that occur following treatment with an agent under an IND/IDE must be reported through ONCORE.   Three options are available to describe the event:  • Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy (e.g., acute myelocytic leukemia [AML])  • Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)  • Treatment-related secondary malignancy   Any malignancy possibly related to cancer treatment (including AML/MDS) should also be reported via the routine reporting mechanisms outlined in each protocol. A second malignancy is one unrelated to the treatment of a prior malignancy (and is NOT a metastasis from the initial malignancy).   
Winship Protocol #: RAD4784 Version Date: Aug 22, 2019  
57 | Page  11.5.6 Definition of unanticipated problems (UP) and reporting requirements  The Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) considers unanticipated problems involving risks to participants or others to include, in general, any incident, experience, or an outcome that meets all the following criteria:  • Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures that are described in the protocol-related documents, such as the IRB-approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the participant population being studied; • Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_3459]); and • Suggests that the research places participants or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  This study will use the OHRP definition of unanticipated problems. Incidents or events that meet the OHRP criteria for UPs require the creation and completion of a UP report form. It is the site investigator’s responsibility to report UPs to their IRB and to the DCC/study sponsor. The UP report will include the following information:  • Protocol identifying information: protocol title and number, PI’s name, and the IRB project number; • A detailed description of the event, incident, experience, or outcome; • An explanation of the basis for determining that the event, incident, experience, or outcome represents an UP; • A description of any changes to the protocol or other corrective actions that have been taken or are proposed in response to the UP.  The IND sponsor will make an assessment of whether the event constitutes an unanticipated problem posing risks to subjects or others (UP). This assessment will be provided to the Emory University IRB.  If the Emory IRB determines an event is a UP it will notify the appropriate regulatory agencies and institutional officials.

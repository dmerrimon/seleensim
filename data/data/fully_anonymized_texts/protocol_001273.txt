subjects with moderate to severe UC.”  
Rationale: To enable evaluation of endoscopic 
remission.
Sections 2.1 and 2.2, revised primary objective 
and primary endpoint text from “mucosal 
healing” to “endoscopic improvement”, and added that endoscopic improvement would be defined as Mayo endoscopic subscore of 0 or 1, “and without friability”. 
Rationale: Endoscopic improvement can be 
derived from the Mayo endoscopic subscore 
alone, whereas mucosal healing would require a validated histologic assessment of the mucosa.Definition further clarifies evaluation of endoscopic improvement.
Section 2.2, addition of secondary endpoint:

Page 18PROTOCOL SUMMARY
Background and Rationale:
The investigational product (I P), PF -06480605, i s currentl y being developed for the 
treatment of inflammatory  bowel disease ( IBD).
PF-[ADDRESS_506091] Tumor Necrosis Factor -like 
Ligand 1A (TL1A), a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family  of cy tokines.  
PF-06480605 contains three mutations in the Fc region to reduce effector function.  I ts 
mechanism of action is to neutralize the binding and subsequent signaling of TL 1A to its 
functional receptor Death Receptor 3 (DR3).
The TL1A/DR3 pathway has been implicated in the regulation of pathogenic Th1 , Th2, Th9
and Th17 T -cells, and of NK and NK- T cell responses, in immune -mediated diseases.  The 
TL1A expression on antigen presenting cells (monocy tes, macrophages, dendritic cells) and 
DR3 expression on effector cells ( ILC2, T-cells, NK and NK -T cells) is highly  dependent on 
pro-inflammatory  conditions.   Moreover, data from nonclinical species and humans implicate 
TL1A in the pathophy siology  of IBD .1
This multicenter, single arm (non -placebo controlled), two
-stage study  will be the first use of 
PF-06480605 in subjects with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis ( UC).  The objectives of 
this study  are to evaluate the safet y, tolerability , pharmacokinetics ( PK)and efficacy  (based 
on May o endoscopic subscore) of PF
-06480605.
The current non -clinical toxicology  package available will support a 12 week treatment 
period.  To mitigate the need for a placebo arm, endoscopic improvement, a more objective
endpoint, with lower placebo rate sthan clinical disease activity  scores, was selected as the

Page 21Study Design and Treatments
This is a Phase 2a, single arm, two-stage study in subjects with moderate to severe UC.  
Subjects will receive 500 mg of PF-06480605 intravenously every 2 weeks (Q2W) for a total of [ADDRESS_506092] stage (12 evaluable subjects with a Week 14 colonoscopy), an interim analysis (IA) will be performed for an early efficacy assessment.  Enrollment in the second stage will be stopped if the futility criteria are met and any ongoing subjects in the second stage will be moved to the follow-up period.  Otherwise, the study will continue to enroll additional subjects in the second stage for final efficacy assessment.   
The duration of participation for eligible subjects will be approximately [ADDRESS_506093] dose of IP.  Subjects with AEs as a result of positive ADA/NAbs may be requested to return for additional follow-up for up to 3 months after the follow-up/end of study (EOS) visit.  During the treatment period, subjects will visit the site 
every 2 weeks ( 3 days) for IP administration (7 visits), and then will return to the site every 
4 weeks ( 7 days) through Week 24 and again at Week 26, for follow-up visits (5 visits).

UC is characterized b y continuous inflammation that is localized to the colon.  CD is 
characterized b y discontinuous inflammation that affects the entire gastrointestinal tract from 
mouth to anus and long-term debilitating sequelae, such as fistulae and intestinal strictures. 
The incidence rates of UC in North America ha vebeen reported as high as 19. 2 per 100,000

TL1A expression on antigen pres enting cells (monocy tes, macrophages, dendritic cells) and 
DR3 expression on effector cells ( ILC2, T-cells, NK and NK -T cells) is highly  dependent on

TL1A in the pat hophy siology  of IBD .1
1.2.2. Safety Data
[IP_ADDRESS]. Non-Clinical Safety
Standalone safety pharmacolog y studies were not conducted with PF -06480605.  Safet y 
pharmacolog y endpoints were incorporated into the design of the 3 -month Good Laboratory  
Practice ( GLP)repeat -dose toxicity  studies.
Toxicity  studies were conducted in CD -1 mice and cy nomolgus monkey s and included 
exploratory  and 3 -month (13 weeks) GL P repeat -dose toxicity  studies (with a 3 month 
recovery  phase ).  The intraveno us (IV)and subcutaneous ( SC)routes of administration were 
selected for the in vivo toxicity  studies as they  are the routes of clinical administration.  I n 
addition, a series of in vitro immunotoxicity
 screening studies were conducted on 
PF-06480605 (Fc a nd C1q binding, human ly mphocy te activation, and human cy tokine 
release assay  [CRA]) and preliminary  immunohistochemical and GL P tissue cross- reactivity  
studies were conducted in a panel of CD -1 mouse, cy nomolgus monkey , and normal human 
tissues.
PF-06480605 was administered to mice and cy nomolgus monkey s once weekl y via the IV 
and SC routes up to 3
months in duration (up to a total of 14 doses).  The 
no-observed - adverse-effect levels (NOAELs) in the 3- month GL P repeat -dose toxicity  
studies were the highest doses tested, which were 250 and 300 mg/kg/week for both IV and 
SC routes in mice and cynomolgus monkey s, respectivel y. 
The findings in the exploratory  toxicity  studies were generall y consistent with those observed 
in the GL P studies.  However, in one exploratory  study  in mice, four female mice died 
following PF -06480605 administration at the low and intermediate -dose groups.  The deaths 
of the three animals at 1 mg/kg/week occurred on Day s15, 22, and [ADDRESS_506107] 
article administration.  The si ngle animal at 10 mg/kg/week also died shortly  after test article 
administration on Day 22.  Because the deaths did not occur in a dose -responsive manner, no 
deaths were seen in another [ADDRESS_506108] article -related 
deaths wer e seen in the 3 -month GL P repeat -dose toxicity study  at doses up to 
250mg/kg/week, the deaths were considered unrelated to direct toxicity  of the test article.  
Although ADAs were not evaluated in this study , based on timing of the deaths, the inverse 
dose relationship, the administration of a human antibody  to a mouse, and the lack of overt 
clinical signs of toxicity , the cause of death was consistent with immunogenicity .  
Immunogenicit y in animals is not considered predictive of immunogenicity in humans .8

PF-[ADDRESS_506109] article -related, nonadverse higher serum globulin concentrations were observed for both 
IV and SC routes in the 3- month GL P studies in mice and cy nomolgus monkey s and were 
associated with higher total protein values and/or lower albumin/globulin ratios.  The higher 
serum globulin concentrations, increased total protein values, and lower albumin/globulin 
ratios were considered most likely  to represent the presence of PF -06480605 mAb.  I n 
addition, findings consistent with an inflammatory process (eg, increased neutrophil counts, 
fibrinogen concentrations, or incidence of microscopic inflammatory  lesions), which can 
result in increased globulin concentrations, were not observed.  The higher serum globulin 
concentrations, increased total protein values, and lower albumin/globulin ratios reversed by

article -related, nonadverse higher absolute reticulocy te counts and red blood cell distribution 
width (RDW) values were also observed in mice at 250 mg/kg/week SC.  These changes 
were considered indicative of increased red blood cell (RBC) turnove r, as reticulocy tes are 
younger and larger RBCs and were not considered adverse due to the small magnitude of 
change.  Higher mean absolute reticulocy te counts and higher RDW values were not 
observed in mice administered PF- 06480605 by  [CONTACT_2736] (all do se levels), and there were 
no other test article -related effects on hematological parameters.  In addition, no test 
article -related effects were noted on hematological parameters in the [ADDRESS_506110] article -related effects on electrocardiograms (ECGs) , 
heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], and bod y temperature in cynomolgus monkeys in the [ADDRESS_506111] doses tested, which were 250 and 
300mg/kg/week for mouse and cy nomolgus monkey s, respectively , for both IV and SC 
routes.  The exposure margins (based on the average concentration for the do sing interval 
[Cav]) at these NOAELs in mice were 21x and 15x for IV and SC, respectively , and in 
cynomolgus monkey s were 54x and 37x, for IV and SC, respectively, relative to the 
500mgIV dosage exposure at stead y state to be evaluated in this study .  Similarly , for C max, 
the exposure margins at these NOAEL s in mice were 29x and 12x for IV and SC, 
respectivel y, and in cy nomolgus monkey s were 59x and 30x respectivel y. In vitro, 
PF

[IFN-, IL-6, and TNF -]) in the solid phase cy tokine release assay  (CRA )in most human 
donors that was greater than that observed for the isoty pe and negative controls, but was 
substantially  lower than that observed with the positive control antibodies (anti -CD3 mAb

majority  of staining observed was cy toplasmic in nature, and it is unlikely  that the cy toplasm 
and cy toplasmic structures would be accessible to the test article in vivo.  No adverse 
findings were observed in the dosing phase of the 3- month GL P repeat -dose toxicity  studies 
conducted in mice and cynomolgus monkey s, which provides further support that the 
staining observed in the ex vivo tissue cross- reactivity  study  does not translate in vivo. 
The nonclinical safet y profile of PF -06480605 has been adequatel y characterized in vitro and 
in mice and cy nomolgus monkey s in vivo to support clinical trials with dosing up to 
3months in duration.   The only  finding in the 3 -month toxicity  studies was in the mouse 
study .  If the exposure limit is determined as 1/10thof the exposure at the highest dose tested 
in 3-month mouse I V study  ie, C max= 869g/mL , Cav= 459g/mL , for the proposed 
regimen of 500 mg Q2W, the corresponding exposure margins for C maxand C avat steady

The maternal and developmental no -observed -adverse- effect level (NOAEL) for PF -

[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharm acokinetics Results
Following single IV infusion dosing of PF -06480605 under fasted conditions at doses 
ranging between 1 mg and 800 mg, median time to reach maximum concentration (T max)
occurred at 1.5 to 2 hours following the end of a 1 -hour infusion.  A fter reaching the 
maximum observed concentration ( Cmax), the concentration time profile exhibited a 
multiphasic decline over time, with mean terminal half-life ( t1/2)values ranging between 6 
and 23 days.  Mean t 1/2values at the lower doses appeared to be shorter than those observed 
at the higher doses which may  be due in part to immunogenicity  and/or sensitivity  of the 
assay  (more quantifiable serum concentrations above the limit of quantification at later time 
points for the higher doses). 
Geometric mea n dose normalized area under the curve ( AUC )showed an upward trend with 
an increase in dose following single I V doses with greater than dose proportional increases 
across the 1 mg to 800 mg dose range.  Dose normalized C maxappeared to increase in 
approxi matel y dose proportional manner across the dose range studied. 
Drug clearance (CL) following IV dosing of PF -06480605 appeared to decrease as the doses 
increased, with mean CL value of 0.018 L/hr at the 1 mg dose and 0.007 L/hr at the 800 mg 
dose.  Volume of distribution at steady  state (V ss) for IV dosing was low, with mean Vss 
values ranging between 3.[ADDRESS_506118] variability  in PF -06480605 exposure was low to moderate, based on 
geometric %CV and ranged between 12% and 33% for the area under the concentration -time 
curve from time 0 to infinity  (AUC inf)and 8% to 26% for C max.

proportional increases across the 30 mg to 300 mg SC doses.  Estimated bioavailability  (F)

Day 1 were 47%, 44%, and 42%, respectively , relative t o the corresponding IV doses 
(AUC 14days) from the SAD portion of the study. 
Overall, observed serum exposures (mean AUC tauand C max) on Day s 15 and 29 were higher

Page 32Cmax(Rac, Cmax) based on geometric mean C maxon Day 29 ranged between 2.3 and 4.2, 
indicating that some drug accumulation does occur following multiple SC dosing every  
2weeks at doses ranging between 30 mg and 300 mg.  Apparent CLfor SC dosing (CL /F) 
and apparent volume of distribution for SC dosing (Vz/F) geometric mean values for the 
100mg to 300 mg SC doses (individual values for 30 mg SC dose) on Day 29 were 
approx imatel y similar across all 3 SC doses, with mean CL /F and Vz/F values ranging 
between 0.013 and 0.018 L/hr and 4.7 and 8.5 L, respectivel y.  Mean t 1/2values for the SC 
doses on Day 29 ranged between 8.7 and 21 days with the longer t 1/2values observed at the 
100mg and 300 mg doses. 
Following multiple dose administration of a 500 mg IV dose once every  2weeks for a total 
of 3doses, mean C maxvalues on Day 1, Day 15, and Day 29 were observed slightly  later than 
the end of a 1 -hour infusion (median T maxranged between 1.[ADDRESS_506121] -dose).  
Higher geometric mean AUC tauvalues were observed on Days 15 and 29 compared to Day 1 
with similar C maxvalues observed across all dosing day s.  Mean R acbased on geometric 
mean AUC tauon Day 29 was 2.1, and R ac, Cmaxbased on geometric mean C maxon Day 29 
was 1.4, indicating that there is slight drug accumulation following multiple IV dosing every  
2weeks.  CL and V ssgeometric mean values on Day 29 were 0.008 L/hr and 5.6 L, 
respectivel y.  Mean t 1/2was [ADDRESS_506122] variability  in PF -06480605 exposure on Day 29 for the SC and IV doses 
based on geometric %CV ranged between 14% and 49% for AUC and 7% to 74% for C max, 
with the higher variability observed for the SC dosing compared to the IV dose. 
ThePK parameters reported above were summarized by  [CONTACT_9084], irrespective of 
immunogenicity  status of the subject.  Importantl y, the impact of immunogenicity on PK at 
the higher doses was not significant as the CL  was similar after single (300, 600, 800 mgIV)
or comparable multiple doses (500 mgIV) and each showed CL similar to typi[INVESTIGATOR_226798]1 
monoclonal antibodies.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Immunogenicity Results
The incidence of ADA ranged from 50% to 100% for SAD and MAD cohorts.  I n subjects 
receiving PF -06480605, 56 subjects out of 68 subjects were considered to be positive for 
ADA.  The overall confirmed treatment induced incidence rate was 82.4%; however, there 
were 11subjects for whom PF -06480605 concentrations remained above the assay  tolerance 
level throughout the study.  Posit ive ADA samples were detected as earl y as 336 hours 
(14days) post -dose in the SAD cohorts and on Day 29 in the MAD cohorts.
The incidence of neutralizing antibody  (NAb )ranged from 0% for 2 SAD and 2 MAD 
cohorts to 100% for the [ADDRESS_506123] s receiving PF -06480605, 24 subjects out

was 35.3% .  Positive NAb samples were detected as earl y as 672 hours (28 days) post -dose 
in the SAD cohorts and 1680 hours ( 70days) post -dose in the MAD cohorts.  Where data 
was available, mean serum PF -06480605 concentrations were lower in subjects identified as 
ADA positive, compared to subjects identified as ADA not- positive, and were even lower in 
subjects with NAb log tit er0.70.

1.3.Rationale
1.3.1. Study Rationale
This multicenter, single arm (non -placebo cont rolled), two
-stage study  will be the first use of 
PF-06480605 in subjects with moderate to severe UC.  The objectives of this study  are to 
evaluate the safet y, tolerability , PK and efficacy  (based on May o endoscopic subscore) of 
PF-[ADDRESS_506128] on exposure was restricted to the low dose groups ( 30mg).  
In Stud y B7541002, a dose level is being evaluated that did not show any immunogenicity  
related impact on exposure, and is predicted to achieve >90% neutralization of sTL 1A at 
trough throughout the dosing period .  Further in study  B7541002, the UC patients may  be on 
immunosuppressive therapy which could further reduce the incidence of immunogenicity .
PK, PD, ADA and NAb will be monitored at va rious time points to characterize the potential 
impact of immunogenicity and patients with AEs as a result of positive ADA/NAbs may  be 
requested to return for additional follow -up for up to 3 months after the follow -up/EOS visit.
In addition, historical in ternal data may  be utilized to compare with the safety  data from this 
study  in order to place the safet y findings in context given this is a single arm study.

Page 351.3.2. Dose Rationale
For Study  B7541002, 500 mg administered IV Q2W for a total of 7 doses is being pro posed 
based on the following:  this dose level has been administered in humans and the PK of 
PF-06480605 is ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_401342]1 monoclonal antibodies; at this dose no impact of 
immunogenicity  on PK was evident; based on modeling this dosage is expected to show
target modulation that might drive pharmacology ; and this dosage would provide a safety  
margin of 2.9 and 2.1 -fold for C maxand C avrespectively  compared to 1/10thof the maximum 
exposure (29 and 21 -fold relative to the NOAEL) tested in 3 -month mouse toxi city study .
The dosage of 500 mg Q2W has been administered in Study  B7541001 and the CL  and V ss
geometric mean values on Day 29 of 0.008 L/hr and 5.6 L, respectively , and mean t 1/2 of 
20days for PF -06480605 following administration of 500 mg Q2W are simil ar to the values 
for other t ypi[INVESTIGATOR_226798]1 therapeutic monoclonal antibodies as well as endogenous I gG1.10  For 
dosage administrations >[ADDRESS_506129] the degree of neutralization of sTL 1A b y PF-06480605 
(sTL 1A coverage) in serum and gut.  The percentage of patients achieving a 90% sTL1A 
(P90) coverage for different regimens were simulated including administration of 150 and 
300mg SC Q2W and 500 mg IV Q2W for 24 weeks.  The P 90values following 
administration of 150 mg SC, 300 mg SC and 500 mg IV Q2W for 24 weeks were 61%, 
76.3% and 87.2%, respectively .  To maximize the chances of seeing efficacy  through 
neutralization of TL 1A, [ADDRESS_506130] that PF- 06480605 administered as 500 mg Q2W 
for a total of 7 doses would provide a median (50thprediction interval) of 299 g/mL  and 
216g/mL  for C maxand C avat steady  state respectively .  When compared to 1/10thof the 
exposures at the highest mouse IV dose in the 3 -month GL P toxicity  studies, i t is anticipated 
that this dosage of 500 mg Q2W will maintain a 2.9 and 2.1 -fold(29 and 21 -fold relative to 
the NOAEL) safet y margin for C maxand C avrespectively .
1.3.3. Summary of Benefits and Risks
IBD is a serious and potentially  life-threatening disease. Overall, the safet y profile observed 
during the Phase 1 program for PF
-06480605 appears to be acceptable at dosages up to 
800mg administered intravenousl y as single doses and up to 500 mg administered 
intravenously  as multiple doses.

5.STUDY TREATMENTS
For the purposes of this study , and per International Conference on Harmonization ( ICH )
guidelines IPis defined as a pharmaceutical form of an active ingredient or placebo being 
tested or used a s a reference in a clinical trial, including a product with a marketing 
authorization when used or assembled (formulated or packaged) in a way  different from the 
approved form, or when used for an unapproved indication, or when used to gain further 
informa tion about an approved use (ICH E6 1.33) .
5.1.Allocation to Treatment
Subject enrollment and assignment of treatment will be managed through the use of a 
centralized Interactive Response Technology  (IRT) sy stem or another suitable sy stem. 
During the screening period, subjects are to be assigned a Single Subject Identifier (SSI D) 
number via an automated I RT s ystem or another equivalent sy stem managed by  [CONTACT_4618]. 
Subjects who meet all of the eligibility criteria (See Section SUBJECT SELECTI ON) are 
qualified to participate and receive IP within the study .  At the point of study  eligibility  and 
enrollment, a subject should be assigned an enrollment or treatment number as allocated via 
the IRT or equivalent s ystem so as to uniquely  track their participation in study  conduct.
IP will only  be administered to subjects who have signed and dated an Institutional Review 
Board ( IRB)or Independent Ethics Committee ( IEC
)approved informed consent document 
(ICD)and who have met all e ligibility  criteria. 
The investigator’s knowledge of the treatment should not influence the decision to enroll a 
particular subject or affect the order in which subjects are enrolled.
5.2.Subject Compliance
All doses of IP will be administered by [CONTACT_401359].

administration of PF -06480605, and for a minimum of 2 hours after administration has 
ended . 
Some of the major safety concerns associated with immunogenicity  are anaphy laxis, cy tokine 
release sy ndrome, “infusion reactions”, and non -acute reactions su ch as delayed 
hypersensitivity ; and m anifestations may  be common among these events. 
The i nformation below is provided as guidance to assess anaphy laxis , but the clinical 
judgment of the in vestigator should be considered as well.
Anaph ylaxis is a serious, acute allergic reaction characterized by  [CONTACT_401360]. 
Signs and sy mptoms of anaphylaxis may  include: 
Generalized hives, pruritis/itching, flushing, swollen lips/tongue/uvula ;
Symptoms of respi[INVESTIGATOR_11310] (e g,dyspnea, wheeze/bronchospasm, stridor, 
reduced peak expi[INVESTIGATOR_11311], hy poxemia) ;
Reduced blood pressure (systolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg or greater 
than 30% decrease from baseline) or associated s ymptoms of end -organ d ysfunction 
(eg,hypotonia [collapse], sy ncope, incontinence) ;
Persistent gastrointestinal sy mptoms (e g,crampy  abdominal pain, vomiting).
The Sponsor recommends use of the Sampson criteria13for further guidance regarding the 
diagnosis of anaph ylaxis reactions.
If a subject experiences anaphy laxis , IP administration should be discontinued immediate ly 
and permanently .
If a subject experiences symptoms that may  be attributed to hy persensitivity reaction or 
delay ed hypersensitivity  (eg,fever, rash, arthralgia, my algia, hematuria, proteinuria, serositis, 
central nervous s ystem complications, or hemoly tic anemia) IP infusion should be stopped.  
In the event that s ymptoms are mild or minor in severit y, at the discretion of the investigator, 
the infusion may  be restarted at a slower rate if s ymptoms are resolved within 1 hour after the 
stop of infusion.   If symptoms return, I P should be discontinued immediately  and 
permanentl y. 
In the event that there is an infusion interruption, the entire duration of IP infusion, from the 
initial start of infusion, to the completion of infusion, should not exceed 3 hours.  Subjects 
will receive appropriate treatment at the discretion of the investigator.

Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time at their own request, or they may be 
withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the investigator or sponsor for safety or behavioral reasons, or the inability of the subject to comply with the protocol-required schedule of study visits or procedures at a given study site.
If a subject does not return for a scheduled visit, every effort should be made to contact [CONTACT_1560].  All attempts to contact [CONTACT_401363]’s medical record.  In any circumstance, every effort should be made to document subject outcome, if possible.  The investigator should inquire about the reason for withdrawal, request that the subject return for a final visit, if applicable, and follow up with the subject regarding any unresolved AEs.
If the subject withdraws from the study, and also withdraws consent for disclosure of future 
information, no further evaluations should be performed, and no additional data should be collected.  The sponsor may retain and continue to use any data collected before such withdrawal of consent.
7. ASSESSMENTS
Every effort should be made to ensure that the protocol-required tests and procedures are 
completed as described. However, it is anticipated that from time to time there may be circumstances, outside of the control of the investigator that may make it unfeasible to perform the test. In these cases the investigator will take all steps necessary to ensure the safety and well-being of the subject. When a protocol-required test cannot be performed, the investigator will document the reason for this and any corrective and preventive actions that he or she has taken to ensure that normal processes are adhered to as soon as possible. The study team will be informed of these incidents in a timely fashion.CCI

7.2.3. Purified Protein Derivative ([COMPANY_003]) Tuberculin Test
Subjects may  be screened for TBusing the [COMPANY_003] Tuberculin Test per local guidelines.  The 
test c onsists of intracutaneous injection of 5 Tuberculin Units (5 TU) [COMPANY_003] in 0.[ADDRESS_506197] of the forearm, using a short beveled 26 -or 27 -gauge needle 
(Mantoux test).  After the tuberculin test is administered, the test area will be e valuated by  a 
qualified healthcare professional, per local guidelines, [ADDRESS_506198] is positive if the induration diameter is 25mm at [ADDRESS_506199] was performed and documented negative within 12 weeks prior to screening.  Subjects 
with suspected false positive [COMPANY_003] results, eg, results from suspected BCG vaccination, 
shoul d be further tested with an Interferon Gamma Release Assay  (IGRA) assay  during 
screening. 
7.2.4. Interferon Gamma Release Assay Tuberculin Test
Subjects may  be screened for TBusing an IGRA per local guidelines.  IGRA will be tested 
locally  where feasible during screening or within 12 weeks prior to screening.  The following 
are acceptable assay s:  QuantiFERON-TB Gold test (QFT -G), QuantiFERON-TB Gold 
In-Tube test (QFT -GIT) and T -SPOTTB test.  Blood sampling may  include 3 mL up to 
10mL of blood.  Site person nel should follow the processing and anal yses steps based on the 
assay  chosen.  Ensure incubation steps are followed as appropriate. 
The sample(s) will be analy zed by  [CONTACT_779]’s local laboratory where feasible .  Refer to local 
lab for an y additional proce ssing information and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_3931].
7.2.5. Screening for Clostridium Difficile
Highly  sensitive screening tests, with high negative predictive value, should be employ ed in 
evaluating subjects for eligibility  for the study .  The detection of C.difficile by [CONTACT_168079] [stool culture followed b y detection of toxin] is considered the gold standard for 
the diagnosis of the colonization or infection with pathogenic C.difficile .  Comparable 
sensitivity  may  be achieved by  [CONTACT_401364] a point of use rapid membrane 
enzy me immunoassay  card for both C. difficile toxin A and B and glutamate dehy drogenase 
(GDH) antigen on a card.  Use of the card for point of care screening is encouraged where 
permitted by  [CONTACT_1295].  Molecular techniques such as pol ymerase chain reaction 
(PCR) for detection of toxin RNA are also acceptable alternatives. 
Refer to the lab manual for further guidance and instruction for C.difficile screening.

Page 717.2.6. Vital Signs (Blood Pressure, Pulse Rate, and Temperature)
Single sitting BP, pulse rate, and temperature will be measured at times specified in the 
Schedule of Activities.  Additional collection times or changes to collection times will be 
permitted, as necessary to ensure appropriate colle ction of safety  data.
Sitting blood pressure will be measured with the subject’s arm supported at the level of the 
heart, and recorded to the nearest mm Hg.  It is preferred that the same arm (preferabl y the 
dominant arm) be used throughout the study .
The same size BP cuff, which has been properl y sized and calibrated, will be used to measure 
BP each time.  The use of automated devices for measuring BP and pulse rate are acceptable, 
although, when done manually , pulse rate will be measured in the brachial/r adial artery  for at 
least 30 seconds.  When the timing of these measurements coincides with a blood collection, 
it is preferred that vital signs be obtained prior to the nominal time of blood collection.
It is preferred that bod y temperature be collected u sing ty mpanic, oral, or axillary  methods 
and that the same method be used consistently  throughout the study .
7.2.7. Medical History, Physical Examination, Height and Weight
Medical history  (including UC and smoking history ) will be collected at the Screening visi t.
Complete phy sical examinations must be performed by  [CONTACT_093], sub -investigator, or 
a qualified healthcare professional per local guidelines.  Complete phy sical examinations 
consist of assessments of general appearance; skin, head, ey es, ears, nose and throat 
(HEENT); heart, lungs; breast (optional); abdomen; and external genitalia (optional); 
extremities; neurologic function; back; and l ymph nodes.
Targeted ph ysical examinations must be performed by  [CONTACT_093], sub -investigator, or a 
qualif ied healthcare professional per local guidelines and should include skin, heart, lungs, 
abdomen and examination of body  systems where there are s ymptom complaints by  [CONTACT_1560]. 
Complete and Targeted phy sical examinations are performed at specified timep
oints (See 
Schedule of Activities).
Height and weight will be measured without the subject wearing shoes.  Height (inches or 
centimeters) will be measured and recorded at the Screening visit only  and weight (lbs or kg) 
will be measured and recorded at various timepoints (See Schedule of Activities).
7.2.8. Electrocardiogram (ECG)
Twelve (12) lead ECGs should be collected at times specified in the Schedule of Activities .
All scheduled ECGs should be performed after the subject has rested quietly  for at least 
10minutes in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547].  When the timing of these measurements coincides with a 
blood collection, the ECG should be obtained prior to the nominal time of the blood 
collection, BP , and pulse rate.

Page 72To ensure safet y of the subjects, a qualified individual (eg, sub- investigator) at the 
investigator site will make comparisons to baseline measurements taken at screening.  A 
copy  of the ECG should be available as source documents for review.  ECGs will be read 
locally  during the dosing period.  However, all ECGs will be interpreted by  a central reader.  
[COMPANY_007] and the central ECG vendor will provide sites with the instructions and supplies for 
processing.
In some cases, it may  be appropri ate to repeat abnormal ECGs to rule out improper lead 
placement as contributing to the ECG abnormality.  It is important that leads are placed in the 
same positions each time in order to achieve precise ECG recordings.  If a machine -read QTc 
value is prolonged, repeat measurements may  not be necessary  if a qualified phy sician’s 
interpretation determines that the QTc values are in the acceptable range.

endoscope at the Visit 8 or earl y withd rawal visit will be based on the length of the 
instrument at various levels of insertion as well as the morphological features of the intestine 
as seen during screening colonoscop y.  The colonoscopy report and an y photographs and/or

Page 747.3.3. Mayo Score
The Mayo Score is a tool designed to measure disease activity for UC.  The Mayo scoring 
system ranges from 0 to 12 points and consists of 4 subscores, each graded 0 to 3 with the higher score indicating more severe disease activity (See Appendix 2 ).
Stool frequency (Subscore 0-3).
Rectal bleeding (Subscore 0-3).
Findings on endoscopy (Subscore 0-3).
Physician’s global assessment (Subscore 0-3).
Calculation of the Mayo Score requires an assessment of the subject’s stool frequency and 
any amount of blood in the stool.  The Mayo scores will be calculated based on the subject’s stool e-diary data recorded over the [ADDRESS_506203] recently available days reported within 5 days prior to the endoscopy preparation. 
Note that if there is 1 day of e-diary data or no e-diary data recorded prior to the baseline 
endoscopy preparation, then the patient cannot be randomized into the study.
If there are less than 3 available days reported within the 5 days prior to the study visit, the 
average will be taken from the limited available data unless there is no diary data reported within 5 days. In this case, stool frequency and rectal bleeding subscores will be considered as missing.

making the PGA assessment.  It is preferred that the same physician performs all such assessments for a given subject throughout the study.
The Mayo Score at the screening visit must be 6 and [ADDRESS_506204] on a daily basis the following information 
during the study:
‘Normal’ number of stools per day (when not having a flare).  This question will be 
asked only at the screening visit. 
Number of times needed to visit the toilet to have a bowel movement (per day).
Presence of blood in the stools (if any).
Description of blood in the stools (if any).
Diary data will be assessed at the clinic, at each study visit from baseline (Day 1) until the 
end of follow up period (Week 26).  The information extracted will be used for calculation of Mayo score taking into account the data recorded over the last 3 days prior to each study visit.  Three (3) day patient e-diary data must be completed and assessed prior to any bowel preparations. If there are missing e-diary data, the average will be taken from the [ADDRESS_506205] recently available days reported within 5 days prior to the endoscopy preparation.  If there are less than 3 available days reported within the 5 days prior to the study visit, the average will be taken from the limited available data unless there is no e-diary data reported within 5 days.  In this case, stool frequency and rectal bleeding subscores will be considered as missing. Note that if there is 1 day of e-d iary data or no e-diary data recorded prior to the 
baseline endoscopy preparation, then the patient cannot be randomized into the study.
In order to encourage consistent diary recording, subjects should enter diary data 
continuously throughout the study.  Instructions for completing the e-diary will be provided to subjects at screening and reviewed at subsequent visits.

Drug misuse; 
Drug interactions;
Extravasation;
Exposure during pregnancy (EDP) ;
Exposure via breastfeeding ;
Medication error ;
Occupational e xposure.
8.4.Medication Errors
Medication errors may  result, in this study , from the administration or consumption of the 
wrong product , by [CONTACT_1148], at the wrong time, or at the wrong dosage strength.  
Such medication errors occurring to a stud y participant are to be captured on the medication 
error CRF ,which is a specific version of the AE page ,and on the SAE form when 
appropriate.  In the event of medication dosing error, the sponsor should be notified 
immediately .
Medication errors are reportable irrespective of the presence of an associated AE/SAE, 
including:
Medication errors involving subject exposure to the IP;
Potential medication errors or uses outside of what is foreseen in the protocol that do 
or do not involve the participating subject.

and, if applicable, an y associated AE(s) are captured on an AE CRF page.
8.5.Abnormal Test Findings
The criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test finding should be reported as 
an AEare as follows: 
Test result is associated with accompan ying symptoms; and/or
Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention ;
and/or
Test result leads to a ch ange in study  dosing or discontinuation from the study , 
significant additional concomitant drug treatment, or other therap y;and/or
Test result is considered to be an AEby [CONTACT_4687].
Merel y repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of a ny of the above conditions, does not 
constitute an AE.  An y abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require 
reporting as an AE.
8.6.Serious Adverse Events
Aserious adverse event is any  untoward medical occurrence at any  dose that:
Results in death;
Is life -threatening (immediate risk of death);
Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];
Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity (substantial disruption of the 
ability  to conduct normal life functions) ;
Results in congenital anomaly /birth defect.
Medical and scientific judgment isexercised in determining whether an event is an important 
medical event.  An important medical event may  not be immediately  life-threatening and/or 
result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  However, if it is determined that the event may  jeopardize 
the subject or may  require intervention to prevent one of the other AEoutcomes, the 
important medical event should be reported as serious.
Examples of such events are int ensive treatment in an emergency  room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm; blood dy
scrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; 
or development of drug dependency  or drug abuse.

8.6.2. Potential Cases of Drug
-Induced Liver Injury 
Abnormal values in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 
levels concurrent with abnormal elevations in total bilirubin level that meet the criteria 
outline d below in the absence of other causes of liver injury  are considered potential cases of 
drug-induced liver injury (potential Hy ’s law cases) and should alway s be considered 
important medical events. 
The threshold of laboratory  abnormalities for a potenti al case of drug- induced liver injury  
depends on the subject’s individual baseline values and underl ying conditions.   Subjects who 
present with the following laboratory  abnormalities should be evaluated further to 
definitively  determine the etiology  of the 
abnormal laboratory  values:
Subjects with AST or ALT and total bilirubin baseline values within the normal range 
who subsequently  present with AST or AL T values 3times the upper limit of 
normal (×ULN) concurrent with a total bilirubin value  2 ×ULN wit h no evidence 
of hemoly sis and an alkaline phosphatase value 2
× ULN or not available;
For subjects with preexisting AL TOR AST OR total bilirubin values above the 
ULN , the following threshold values should be used in the definition mentioned 
above:
For s ubjects with pre existing AST or AL T baseline values above the normal 
range: AST or ALT 
values  2times the baseline values and 3 ×ULN, or 
8
×ULN (whichever is smaller).
Concurrent with
For subjects with pre existing values of total bilirubin above the n ormal range: 
Total bilirubin level increased from baseline by  [CONTACT_8895] 1 ×ULN or
if the value reaches 3 ×ULN (whichever is smaller).
The subject should return to the investigational site and be evaluated as soon as possible,

defined above , with no other cause for liver function test ( LFT
)abnormalities identified at 
the time ,should be considered potential Hy ’s law cases irrespective of availability of all the 
results of the investigations performed to determine etiology  of the abnor mal L FTs.  Such

Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] f or observation without a medical AE;
Preplanned treatments or surgical procedures .  These should be noted in the baseline 
documentation for the entire protocol and/or for the individual subject .
Diagnostic and therapeutic noninvasive and invasive procedure s, such as surgery , should not 
be reported as 
AEs.  However, the medical condition for which the procedure was performed 
should be reported if it meets the definition of an AE.  For example, an acute appendicitis 
that begins during the AEreporting period should be reported as the AE , and the resulting 
appendectomy  should be recorded as treatment of the AE.
8.8.Severity Assessment
If required on the AECRFs , the investigator will use the adjectives M ILD, MODERATE, 
or SEVERE to describe the maximum intensity  of the AE .  For purposes of consistency , 
these intensity  grades are defined as follows:
MILD Does not interfere with subject's usual function.
MODERATE Interferes to some extent with subject's usual function.
SEVERE Interferes significantl y with subject's usual function.
Note the distinction between the severit y and the seriousness of an AE.  A severe event is not 
necessarily  an SAE .  For example, a headache may  be severe (interferes significantly  with 
the subject's usual function) but would not be classif ied as serious unless it met one of the 
criteria for SAE s, listed above.
8.9.Causality Assessment
The investigator’s assessment of causalit y must be provided for all AEs (serious and 
non-serious); the investigator must record the causal relationship in the CRF , as appropriate, 
and report such an assessment in accordance with the SAE reporting requirements if 
applicable.  An investigator’s causality  assessment is the determination of whether there 
exists a reasonable possibility  that the IPcaused or contributed
to an AE ; generall y the facts 
(evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship should be provided .  If the 
investigator does not know whether or not the IPcaused the event, then the event will be 
handled as “related to IP” for reporting purposes, as defined b y the sponsor (see the s ection 
on Reporting Requirements ).  If the investigator's causality  assessment is "unknown but not 
related to IP," this should be clearly  documented on study  records. 
In additi
on, if the investigator determines that anSAE is associated with study  procedures, 
the investigator must record this causal relationship in the source documents and CRF, as 
appropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the SAE reporting 
requirements, if applicable.

Page 878.10. Exposure During Pregnancy
For both unapproved/unlicensed products and for marketed products , an exposure during 
pregnancy  occurs if:
1.A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while rece iving or having been 
exposed (eg , because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the IP; or the female 
becomes or is found to be pregnant after discontinuing and/or being exposed to the 
IP.
An example of environmental exposure would be a case involving direct contact [CONTACT_4490] 
a [COMPANY_007] product in a pregnant woman (eg , a nurse reports that she is pregnant and has 
been exposed to chemotherapeutic products).
2.
Amale has been exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the 
IPprior to or around the time of conception and/or is exposed during his partner’s 
pregnancy .
If astudy  subject or study  subject’s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the 
study  subject’s treatment with the IP, the investigator must submit this information to the 
[COMPANY_007] drug safety unit on an SAE report form and an EDP supplemental form, regardless of 
whether an SAE has occurred .  In addition, the investigator must submit information 
regarding environmental exposure to a [COMPANY_007] product in a pregnant woman ( eg, a subject 
reports that she is 
pregnant and has been exposed to a cy totoxic product by [CONTACT_31061][INVESTIGATOR_4598]) using the EDP supplemental form.  This must be done irrespective of whether an 
AEhas occurred and within 24 hours of awareness of the exposure. The information 
submitted should include the anticipated date of delivery  (see below for information related 
to termination of pregnancy ).
Follow -up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy  and its outcome for 
all EDP reports with an unknown outcome.  The investigato r will follow the pregnancy  until 
completion (or until pregnancy  termination) and notify  [COMPANY_007] of the outcome as a follow-up 
to the initial EDP supplemental form.  In the case of a live birth, the structural integrity  of the 
neonate can be assessed at the time of birth.  In the event of a termination, the reason(s) for 
termination should be specified and, if clinicall y possible, the structural integrity  of the 
terminated fetus should be assessed b y gros s visual inspection (unless pre procedure test 
findings are conclusive for a congenital anomal y and the findings are reported).
If the outcome of the pregnancy  meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy , 
spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomal y [in a 
live-born baby, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise, or a neonatal death]), the 
investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs.
Additional information about pregnancy  outcomes that are reported as SAE s follows: 
Spontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and missed abortion;

exposure to the IP.
Additional information regarding the EDP may be requested by  [CONTACT_093].  Further 
follow -up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case- by-case basis ( eg, follow -up on 
preterm infants to identify  developmental delay s).In the case of paternal exposure, the 
investigator will provide the study  subject with the Pregnant Partner Release of Information 
Form to deliver to his partner. The i nvestigator must document in the source documents that 
the subject was given the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to provide to his 
partner.
8.11. Occupational Exposure
An occupational exposure occurs when ,during the performance of job duties, a person 
(whether a healthcare professional or otherwis e) gets in unplanned direct contact [CONTACT_8898], which may  or may  not lead to the occurrence of an AE.
An occupational exposure is reported to the drug safet y unit within 24 hours of the 
investigator’s awareness, using the SAE r eport form, regardless of whether there is an 
associated AE/SAE.  Since the information does not pertain to a subject enrolled in the study , 
the information is not reported on a CRF ; however ,a cop y of the completed SAE report form 
is maintained in the investigator site file.
8.12. Wi thdrawal Due to Adverse Events (See A lso the Section on Subject Withdrawal )
Withdrawal due to AEs should be distinguished from withdrawal due to other causes, 
according to the definition of AEnoted earlier, and rec orded on the appropriate AECRF 
page. 
When a subject withdraws because of an SAE , the SAE must be reported in accordance with 
the reporting requirements defined below.
8.13. Eliciting Adverse Event Information
The investigator is to report all directly  observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously  reported b y 
the study  subject /legally  acceptable representative .  In addition, each study  subject /legally  
acceptable representative
will be questioned about AEs.
8.14. Reporting Requirements
Each AEis to be assessed to determine if it meets the criteria for SAE s.  If a nSAE occurs, 
expedited reporting will follow local and international regulations, as appropriate.
8.14.1.
Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements
If anSAE occurs, [COMPANY_007] is to be notified within 24 hours of investiga tor awareness of the 
event .

immediately , irrespective of the extent of available AEinformation.  This time frame also 
applies to additional new information (follow- up) on previously  forwarded SAE reports as 
well as to the initial and follow- up reporting of EDP ,exposure via breastfeeding ,and 
occupational exposure cases. 
In the rare event that the investigator does not become aware of the occurrence of a nSAE
imme diately  (eg, if an outpatient study  subject initially  seeks treatment elsewhere), the 
investigator is to report the event within [ADDRESS_506217] awareness of the AE.
For all SAE s, the investigator is obligated to pursue and provide information to [COMPANY_007] in 
accordance with the time frames for reporting specified above.  In addition, an investigator 
may be requested by  [CONTACT_4695] -up information in an 
expedited fashion.  
This information collected for SAE sismore detailed than that captured 
on the AE CRF .  In general, this will include a description of the AEin sufficient detail to 
allow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independent determination of 
possib le causality .  Information on other possible causes of the event, such as concomitant 
medications, vaccines, and/orillnesses, must be provided.  In the case of a subject death, a 
summary of available autopsy  findings must be submitted as soon as possible to [COMPANY_007] or its 
designated representative. 
8.14.2. Nons erious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements
All AEs will be reported on the AEpage(s) of the CRF.  I t should be noted that the form for 
collection of SAE information is not the same as the AECRF.  Where the same data are 
collected, the forms must be completed in a consistent manner.  For example, the same AE
term should be used on both forms.  AEs should be reported using concise medical 
terminology  on the CRFs as well as on the form for collection of SAE information.
8.14.3. Sponsor ’sReporting Requirements to Regulatory Authorities
AEreporting, including suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions, will be carried out 
in accordance with applicable local regulations.
9. DATA ANALYSIS/STATIS TICAL METHODS
Detailed m ethodology  for summary  and statistical anal yses of the data collected in this study  
will be documented in a statistical analy sis plan(SAP) , which will be maintained by  [CONTACT_103].  This document may  modify  the plans outlined in the protocol; however, any major 
modifications of the primary  endpoint definition and/or its analy sis will also be reflected in a

the Primary Endpoint 
The primary  efficacy  endpoint, endoscopic improvement at Week 14, wi ll be used to assess 
the efficacy  of PF -06480605 under Simon’s two-stage design decision criteria.  The primary  
analysis population will be Per Protocol population, which consists of all subjects who are 
not major protocol violator swith all planned doses received and a final colonoscopy at 
Week 14.  T he point estimate of the endoscopic improvement rate, 2 -sided 95% confidence 
interval and p -value will be calculated using the method described b y Koyama and Chen 
(2008)11according to the actual sample size in the primary  anal ysis population.  Details of 
the methodology  will be documented in the SAP. 
The endoscopic improvement rate at Week 14 for All Treated population will also be 
computed with appropriate confide nce interval as a sensitivity  anal ysis.  Subjects who drop

PF-[ADDRESS_506227] to ensure that 
the protocol and Good Clinical Practices ( GCPs) are being followed.  The monitors may  
review source documents to confirm that the data recorded on CRFs areaccurate.  The 
investigator and institutio n will allow [COMPANY_007] monitors/auditors or its agents and appropriate 
regulatory  authorities direct access to source documents to perform this verification.   This 
verification may  also occur after study  completion.
During study  conduct and/or after study  com pletion, t he study  site may  be subject to review 
by [CONTACT_61315] (I RB)/ ethics committee (EC), and/or to quality  assurance 
audits performed b y [COMPANY_007], or companies working with or on behalf of [COMPANY_007], and/or to 
inspection by  [CONTACT_401367].
The investigator(s) will notify  [COMPANY_007] or its agents immediately  of any  regulatory  inspection 
notification in relation to the study .  Furthermore, the investigator will cooperate with [COMPANY_007] 
or its agents to prepare the study  site for the inspection and will allow [COMPANY_007] or its agent, 
whenever feasible, to be present during the inspection.
  The investigator will promptly  
provide copi[INVESTIGATOR_4599].  Before response submission 
to the regulatory  authorities, the investigator will provide [COMPANY_007] or its agents with an 
opportunity  to review and comment on responses to any  such findings.
It is important that the investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available during the 
monitoring visits and po ssible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the 
process.
11.DATA HANDLING AND RE CORD KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]
11.1. Case Report Forms/Electronic Data Record
As used in this protocol, the term CRF should be understood to refer to either a paper form or 
an ele ctronic data record or both, depending on the data collection method used in this study .
A CRF is required and should be completed for each included subject.  The completed 
original CRFs are the sole propert y of [COMPANY_007] and should not be made available in a ny form to 
third parties, except for authorized representatives of [COMPANY_007] or appropriate regulatory  
authorities, without written permission from [COMPANY_007].
The investigator has ultimate responsibility  for the collection and reporting of all clinical, 
safet y
,and laboratory  data entered on the CRFs and any  other data collection forms (source 
documents) and ensuring th at they  are accurate, authentic /original, attributable, complete, 
consistent, legible, timely  (contemporaneous), enduring ,and available when requ ired.  The 
CRFs must be signed by  [CONTACT_110292]. Any correcti ons to entries made in the CRFs or source 
documents must be dated, initialed ,and explained (if necessa ry) and should not obscure the 
original entry . 
090177e18fe2dcfd\Approved\Approved On: 30-Nov-2018 05:43 (GMT)

PF-[ADDRESS_506228] cases, the source documents are the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]'s or the ph ysician's subject chart.  In 
these cases, data collected on the CRFs must match the data in those charts. 
In some cases, the CRF, or part of th e CRF, may  also serve as source documents.  In these 
cases, a document should be available at the investigat ivesite as well as at [COMPANY_007] and clearl y 
identify  those data that will be recorded in the CRF, and for which the CRF will stand as the 
source docum ent.
11.2. Record Retention
To enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory  authorities or [COMPANY_007], the investigator 
agrees to keep records, including the identity  of all participating subjects (sufficient 
information to link records, eg,CRFs and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]), all original signed informed 
consent documents , copi[INVESTIGATOR_4600], safety  reporting forms, source documents, and 
detailed records of treatment disposition, and adequate documentation of relevant 
correspondence ( eg,letters, meeting minutes, and telephone call reports).  The records should 
be retained b y the investigator according to the ICH guidelines, according to local 
regulations, or as specified in the c linical study agreement (CSA) , whichever is longer.
If the investigator becomes unable for a ny reason to continue to retain study  records for the 
required period ( eg, retirement, relocation), [COMPANY_007] should be prospectivel y notified.  The 
study  records must be transferred to a designee acceptable to [COMPANY_007] , such as another 
investigator, another in stitution, or an independent third party  arranged by  [CONTACT_4618]. 
Investigator records must be kept for a minimum of [ADDRESS_506229] ob tain [COMPANY_007]'s written permission before disposing of an y records, 
even if retention requirements have been met.
12.ETHICS
12.1. Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee
It is the responsibility  of the investigator to have prospective approval of the study  protoc ol, 
protocol amendments, informed consent documents, and other relevant documents, 
eg,recruitment advertisements, if applicable, from the I RB/EC.  All correspondence with the 
IRB/EC should be retained in the investigator f ile.  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_1309] I RB/EC approvals should be 
forwarded to [COMPANY_007].
The only  circumstance in which an amendment may  be initiated prior to IRB/EC approval is 
where the change is necessary  to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the subjects.  In 
that event, the investigator must notify  the IRB/EC and [COMPANY_007] in writing immediately after 
the implementation.
12.2. Ethical Conduct of the Study
The study  will be conducted in accordance with legal and regulatory  requirements, as well as 
the general principles set forth in the International Ethical Guide lines for Biomedical 
Research Involving Human Subjects (Council for International Organizations of Medical

requirements, and legal requirements , including applicable privacy  laws .
The informed consent document s used during the informed consent process must be 
reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_456], approved by  [CONTACT_1201]/EC before use , and available for 
inspection.
The investigator must ensure that each study  subject or his or her legall y acceptable 
representative ,is fully  informed about the nature and objectives of the study  and possible 
risks associated with participation. 
Whenever consent is obtain ed from a subject’s legally  acceptable representative, the 
subject’s assent (affirmative agreement) must subsequently be obtained when the subject has 
the capacity to provide assent, as determined by  [CONTACT_941] I RB/EC.  If the investigator determines 
that a subject’s decisional capacit y is so limited he/she cannot reasonabl y be cons ulted, then, 
as permitted b y the IRB/ EC and consistent with local regulatory  and legal requirements, the 
subject’s assent may  be waived with source documentation of the reason assent wa s not 
obtained.  If the stud y subject does not provide hisor herown consent, the source documents
must record why the sub ject did not provide consent (eg
, minor, decisionally  impaired adult), 
how the investigator determined that the person signing the co nsent was the subject’s legally  
acceptable representative, the consent signer’s relationship to the study  subject (eg, parent, 
spouse) ,
and that the subject’s assent was obtained, or waived.  If assent is obtained verball y 
it must be documented in the sour ce documents.

13.DEFINITION OF END OF TRIAL
13.1. End of Trial in a Member State 
End of trial in a Member State of the European Union is defined as the time at which it is 
deemed that a sufficient number of subjects have been recruited and completed the study  as 
stated in the regulatory  application (i e,clinical trial application [CTA ]) and ethics application 
in the Member State.  Poor recruitment (recruiting less than the anticipated number in the 
CTA) by  a Member State is not a reason for premature termination but is considered a 
normal conclusion to the study  in that Member State.
13.2. End of Trial in A ll Other Participating Countries 
End of trial in all other participating countries is defined as l ast subject last visit (LSLV). 
14.SPONSOR DISCONTINUAT ION CRITERIA
Premature termination of this study  may  occur because of a regulatory  authority  decision, 
change in opi[INVESTIGATOR_1100]/EC, or IPsafety  problems, or at the discretion of [COMPANY_007].  I n 
addition, [COMPANY_007] retains the right to discontinue development of PF-[ADDRESS_506231] all participating subjects and 
the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4601]  (if applicable) within 28days.  As directed b y [COMPANY_007], all study

Page 104Appendix 2. Mayo Scoring System for Assessment of Ulcerative Colitis A ctivity
The May o score ranges from 0 to 12, with higher scores indicating more severe disease.  
Data are from Schroeder et al.
Stool frequency†:
0 = Normal no. of stools for this subject
1 = 1 to 2 stools more than normal
2 = 3 to 4 stools more than normal
3 = 5 or more stools more than normal
Subscore, 0 to 3
Rectal bleeding‡:
0 = No blood seen
1 = Streaks of blood with stool less than half the time
2 = Obvious blood with stool most of the time
3 = Blood alone passes
Subscore, 0 to 3
Findings on endoscopy:
0 = Normal or inactive disease
1 = Mild disease (erythema, decreased vascular pattern, mild friability )
2 = Moderate disease (marked ery thema, lack of vascular pattern, friability , erosions)
3 = Severe disease (spontaneous bleeding, ulceration)
Subscore, 0 to 3
Physician’s global assessment §:
0 = Normal
1 = Mild disease
2 = Moderate disease
3 = Severe disease
Subscore, 0 to 3
†Each subject serves as his or her own control to establish the degree of abnormality of the stool frequency.
‡The daily bleeding score represents the most severe bleeding of the day.
§The physician’s global assessment acknowledges the three other criteria, the subject’s daily recollection of 
abdominal discomfort and general sense of wellbeing, and other observations, such as physi cal findings and 
the subject’s performance status.

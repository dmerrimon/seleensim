 1. Introduction 
Peripheral artery disease (PAD) refers to the atherosclerotic obstruction of the major arteries 
supplying the lower extremities, sometimes also re ferred to as lower extremity artery disease. 
Atherosclerosis of the peripheral circulat ion, with underlying atheroma and chronic 
inflammation, leads to progressive occlusion of medium and la rge arteries, with additional 
risks of embolism or thrombus formation. Abrupt  occlusions and plaque  rupture may lead to 
acute complications such as acute limb ischemia  (ALI), similar to an acute coronary syndrome 
event in the coronary circulation ( Becker et al. 2011 ). 
 
The hypothesis of the VOYAGER study is that riva roxaban added to stan dard of care therapy 
of low-dose acetylsalicylic acid  (ASA), has the potential to redu ce the incidence of the major 
cardiovascular (CV) outcomes (i.e., CV death, myocardial infarction (MI), and ischemic 
stroke) as well as major lower limb vascular  events (i.e. ALI and major amputation) in 
symptomatic PAD patients requiring lower extremity revascularization procedures. This core statistical analysis plan (SAP) is based on the Global Integrated Clinical Study 
Protocol BAY 59-7939/[ZIP_CODE] version 3.0 and contai ns definitions of analysis sets, key 
derived variables and statistical methods fo r analysis of efficacy and safety for the 
VOYAGER study. It provides a techni cal and detailed elaboration of  the principal features of 
the planned analyses, e.g., censoring schemes for time-to-event variables. Amendments and/or 
appendices to this core SAP may be used to a dd additional analysis and provide more details 
on the coding guidelines, data-handl ing, and output tables and figures. 
Titles, mock-ups, and programming instructions fo r all statistical output (tables, figures, and 
listings (TLF)) are provided in a sepa rate TLF specifications document. 
 
2. Study Objectives 
The primary efficacy objective is: 
 To evaluate whether rivaroxaban added to ASA is superior to ASA alone in reducing 
the risk of major thrombotic vascular events  (defined as MI, isch emic stroke, CV death, 
ALI, and major amputation of a vascular  etiology) in symptomatic PAD patients 
undergoing lower extremity reva scularization procedure. 
 The secondary efficacy objectives are: 
 To evaluate whether rivaroxaban added to ASA is superior to ASA alone in reducing 
the risk of MI, ischemic stroke, coronary  heart disease mortality, ALI, and major 
amputation of a vascular etiology 
 To evaluate whether rivaroxaban added to ASA is superior to ASA alone in reducing 
the risk of an unplanned index limb revascularization for recurrent limb ischemia 
(subsequent index leg revascular izations that were not planned or considered as part of 
the initial treatment plan at the time of randomization)

  To evaluate whether rivaroxaban added to ASA is superior to ASA alone in reducing 
the risk of vascular hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5315] a coro nary or peripheral ev ent (either limb) of a 
thrombotic nature 
 To evaluate whether rivaroxaban added to ASA is superior to ASA alone in reducing 
the risk of MI, ischemic stroke, all-cause mortality, ALI,  and major amputation of a 
vascular etiology 
 To evaluate whether rivaroxaban added to ASA is superior to ASA alone in reducing 
the risk of MI, all-cause stroke, CV deat h, ALI, and major amputation of a vascular 
etiology 
 To evaluate whether rivaroxaban added to ASA is superior to ASA alone in reducing 
the risk of all-cause mortality 
 To evaluate whether rivaroxaban added to ASA is superior to ASA alone in reducing 
the risk of venous thromboembolic (VTE) events. 
The primary safety objective of the study is:  
 To evaluate the overall safety and tolerabili ty of rivaroxaban added to ASA compared 
to ASA alone. 
 
3. Study Design 
This study is an international multicenter,  randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 
event-driven phase [ADDRESS_50586] s who fulfill all inclusion criteria and meet 
none of the exclusion criteria will be treated with  ASA 100 mg once daily (od) and randomly 
allocated by [CONTACT_26772] /web response system (IxRS) in a ratio of 1:1 to additional 
treatment with either rivaroxaban 2.5 mg or placebo twice daily (bid). The randomization will 
be stratified by [CONTACT_47883][INVESTIGATOR_7745] (i.e., (i.) surgical vs. (ii) endovascular 
with clopi[INVESTIGATOR_47865]. (iii) endova scular without clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745]). Treatments will be balanced 
within a country for each stratum by [CONTACT_17188]. Randomization and study treatment 
should commence as soon as possible but no late r than 10 days after a successful qualifying 
revascularization procedure and once hemostasis has been assured. All randomized subjects 
will receive study medication (either rivaroxaba n or placebo) and study ASA in a sufficient 
quantity until the next scheduled on-site visit an d detailed instructions for its administration. 
 
The study is event-driven, and thus, all subjects  will be treated (or fo llowed-up in the case of 
permanent discontinuation of study medication) un til the end of treatment (EOT) visit. It is 
estimated that approximately 6,500 subjects (3,250 per treatment group) are needed to be 
enrolled in order to have 1,[ADDRESS_50587] is 
approximately 42 months, and the mean treatment duration is expected to be approximately 
30 months. However, this duration may vary de pending on the recruitment rate as well as the 
primary event rate. 
 Statistical Analysis Plan   
 Protocol No.: BAY 59-7939 / [ZIP_CODE]  Page: [ADDRESS_50588] be assessed in these subjects until the end of the study via either 
clinic visits or telephone contacts.  
 Throughout the study and at all on-site visits, su bjects will be assessed for the occurrence of 
study efficacy outcome events and bleeding even ts. Suspected clinical study outcomes (study 
efficacy outcome and bleeding events) will be assessed independently by [CONTACT_47884] (ICAC) blinded to treatment allocatio n, and the adjudicated 
results will be the basis fo r the final study analyses.  
There will be one formal interim analysis, wh ich will occur when approximately 67% of the 
planned primary efficacy outcomes have accrued and adjudicated. 
A simplified schematic of the study design is provided in the following figure:

 started taking any study medication). The r eason for permanent disc ontinuation of study 
medication will be collected and summarized. 
A subject will be considered as lost to follo w-up for analysis purposes if contact [CONTACT_47886][INVESTIGATOR_47866] s by [CONTACT_779], and the subject’s vital status is 
not obtained and documented in the da tabase at the end of the study. 
4.[ADDRESS_50591] data listing as they are recorded on 
the case report form (CRF) including best estimat e dates of site investigators collected in the 
clinical database.  Missing or incomplete post-randomization event dates All efforts will be made to collect complete data for all subjects randomized in this study 
including visits by [CONTACT_24646]. Subject s will be followed to the study end and all 
required data will be collected, regardless of their compliance with study medications or visits. 
When an event date is not complete, the date will be estimated according to the following 
rules but not earlier than randomization date, 
 If only the onset day is missing, but the month and year are available: 
o If the month and year are the same as the efficacy cut-off date (ECOD), impute the date as mean of the first day of the onset month/year and the ECOD 
(rounded up). 
o Otherwise if the month and year are the same as the last contact [CONTACT_47887] (see Appendix A ), impute the date as mean of the first day of the onset month/year 
and the last contact [CONTACT_47887] (rounded up). For death event,  the last contact 
[CONTACT_47888] +1 day will be used as the death date. 
o Otherwise impute the event date as maxi mum of the date of randomization + 1 
and day 15 of the onset month and year. 
 If the onset day and month is mi ssing, but the year available: 
o The minimum possible date is maximum of randomization date + [ADDRESS_50592] date 
alive and December 31th of the onset year. 
o Impute the event date as mean of the minimum possible date and the maximum possible date (rounded up). 
o For subjects who experienced death in the same year as last contact [CONTACT_47888], the last contact [CONTACT_47888] +1 day will be used as the death date. 
 If the onset date is complete missing, th e onset date will be imputed with the 
randomization date + 1 days. 
 For subjects who experienced death during th e study and the death date is completely 
missing, the last contact [CONTACT_47888] + [ADDRESS_50593] alive date is missing, the deat h date will be imputed as ECOD.

 4.4 Interim Analyses and Data Monitoring 
The Independent Data Monitoring Committee (ID MC) will monitor the st udy for greater than 
expected efficacy and for safety. There will be  one formal pre-planned interim analysis to 
assess greater than expected efficacy, which will be performed when approximately 67% of 
the planned primary efficacy outcome events (~6 80) have accrued and ar e adjudicated. Based 
on that analysis, the study may be stopped early, if there is  overwhelming superiority of 
rivaroxaban (p<0.001, 2-sided) for the primary efficacy endpoint (following the Haybittle-
Peto approach) ( Haybittle 1971 ]. Details on the approach to the interim analyses and 
refinement of decision rules are sp ecified in the IDMC charter.  
4.5 Data Rules 
4.5.1 Analysis Dates 
For the study, the following date and time wi ndow are of relevance for the analysis: 
 Efficacy cut-off date:  
The trial is designed to be terminated  when [ADDRESS_50594] calendar date acceptable for counting events for the primary analysis.  
 Trial close-out window: The time period when all subjects return to the clinic for an EOT visit. All randomized 
subjects should return for their EOT visit after the ECOD. 
For each subject, the following individual dates are of relevance for analysis: 
 Randomization date:  
The date of randomization as r ecorded in the IxRS system.  
 EOT Visit date: 
The date of the EOT visit. If subjects do not have an EOT visit, the date will be 
missing. 
 Date of last contact: 
[CONTACT_47889] w ith the subject or a third party (including 
data on subject survival status, see Appendix A  for details). 
 Date of first dose of study treatment:  
The date of the first dose of rivaroxaban or rivaroxaban placebo, defined as: 
o Date of first dose from the appropriate CRF page capturing the study 
medication (rivaroxaban or rivaroxaban placebo) if this date is complete.  
o Date of the earliest logically possible dose of study medication (rivaroxaban or 
rivaroxaban placebo) administration in cases where the date of first dose is 
missing or incomplete. See Appendix D  for details of th e imputation rules. 
 Date of last dose of study treatment:  
 Statistical Analysis Plan   
 Protocol No.: BAY 59-7939 / [ZIP_CODE]  Page: [ADDRESS_50595] dose of rivaroxa ban or rivaroxaban placebo, defined as: 
o Date of last dose from the appr opriate CRF page capturing the study 
medication (rivaroxaban or rivaroxaban placebo) if this date is complete.  
o Date of the latest logically possible do se of study medication (rivaroxaban or 
rivaroxaban placebo) administration in cas es where the date of last dose is 
missing or incomplete. See Appendix D  for details of th e imputation rules. 
4.5.2 Data Scopes 
All analyses are based on two elements:  
1) analysis set , which specifies which subjects will be included in an analysis; and  
2) data scope , which specifies the time window within which data will be included in an 
analysis.  This section describes the coverage of the event data scopes  used for the statistical analyses. 
Analysis sets  are described in Section 5. 
Data scope according to intention-to-treat principle (ITT) The ITT data scope includes outcome events  observed from randomization date until the 
ECOD. Events occurring after the ECOD will not be counted for primary analysis.  This ITT 
data scope will be applied mainly to the analyses of efficacy variables. Data scope according to treatment (on-treatment) The on-treatment data scope will include all outcome events observed from randomization 
until 2 days following permanent discontinuation of the study drug. This on-treatment data 
scope will be applied mainly to the anal yses of safety variables (e.g. bleeding). 
Data scope according to overall study duration for sensitivity analysis The overall study duration data scope will in clude all outcome events observed from 
randomization until the last contact/visit. This data scope will be applied for sensitivity 
analysis only. 
4.5.[ADDRESS_50596] event analys es depends on the type of endpoint, thereby 
[CONTACT_47890] (primary efficacy composite and component, 
secondary efficacy and bleeding events ) and CV-death / all-cause mortality.

For on-treatment analyses (primary analysis fo r time to bleeding events, sensitivity analysis 
for primary efficacy endpoint and all secondary efficacy endpoints), patient with at least one 
dose of study medication and without documentation of an event within the on-treatment data 
scope will be censored similarly to the ITT data  scope except that the date of last dose of 
study treatment + [ADDRESS_50600] alive will be used as the cap for the time scope instead of ECOD. See Appendix A  for additional details. 
4.6 Determination of sample size 
The study is event-driven and it is estimat ed that approximately 6,500 patients (3,250 per 
treatment group) need to be randomized in order to have 1,[ADDRESS_50601] to the primary 
outcome with a power of 90% and a one-sided level of significance α=0.025 under the 
following assumptions: 
 The effect size (Hazard Ratio  (HR)) for rivaroxaban plus ASA vs. ASA alone is 
HR=0.80. 
 The annualized event rate in the contro l arm is approximately 7.5% per year. 
 The rate of patients with permanent discont inuation of study drug (rivaroxaban plus 
ASA switching to ASA alone or an equa lly effective treatment regimen) is 
approximately 5.5% 1st year, 8% 2nd year, 12% 3rd year (4% 1st half year + 8% 2nd half 
year), and 8% every ha lf year afterwards. 
 Statistical Analysis Plan   
 Protocol No.: BAY 59-7939 / [ZIP_CODE]  Page: 13 of 36
 
  The rate of patients lost to  follow-up or with non-CV death is approximately 1.5% per 
year. 
 The duration of the enrollment period is 18 months (approximately 15% 1st 6 months, 
30% 2nd 6 months, 55% 3rd 6 months) and [ADDRESS_50602] patient-
randomized until the ECOD. 
The number of patients enrolled may be adjusted  and the study duration may be adapted based 
on a blinded review of the observed overall event rate of confirmed primary efficacy 
outcomes during the study. 
Sample size estimation was based on PASS 11 ( Hintze 2011 ).  
 
5. Analysis Sets 
5.[ADDRESS_50603] udy are valid for assignm ent to analysis sets. 
5.1.1 Intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis set 
The intention-to-treat analysis set, also termed full analysis set in the International Conference 
on Harmonization (ICH) E9 guideline, will includ e all randomized subjects. Subjects will be 
categorized to the treatment group to which they were assigned by [CONTACT_47893]; i.e., they will be 
analyzed as randomized. 
5.1.2 Safety analysis set (SAF) 
The SAF will include all randomized subjects who received at leas t one dose of study 
medication (rivaroxaban or rivaroxaban placebo). Subjects will be categorized to the group to 
which they were assigned by [CONTACT_47894]. In this case, subjects will be an alyzed for safety as actually treated. 
The planned analyses for the primary and s econdary efficacy and safety variables are

The null hypothesis will be: 
H0, PE: SR(t) = S A(t) for all time points t ≥0, (i.e., "there is no difference between the 
rivaroxaban added to ASA group and the ASA alone group regarding the primary 
efficacy outcome for all time points"), 
and the one-sided alternative hypothesis will be: 
H1, PE: SR(t) >S A(t) for at least one time point t ≥0, and S R(t) ≥SA(t) for all time points 
t ≥0, (i.e., "there is a difference between the two groups in favor of rivaroxaban 
regarding the primary efficacy outcome  for at least one time point"), 
where SR denotes the survival function of the rivaroxaban added to ASA group and SA 
denotes the survival func tion of the ASA alone group. 
 
The rivaroxaban added to ASA group will be compared to the ASA alone group using a log-
rank test stratified by [CONTACT_47903] [INVESTIGATOR_47868] ((i.) surgical  vs. (ii.) endovascular 
with clopi[INVESTIGATOR_47865]. (iii.) e ndovascular without clopi[INVESTIGATOR_47874]) with 
treatment as a fixed factor. Superiority of ri varoxaban over placebo will be declared, if the 
associated one-sided null hypothesis is rejected in favor of rivaroxaban at the 2.5% 
significance level. 
 Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimates of cumulative risk and cumulative hazard functions will be 
provided to evaluate the timing of event occurrence in the diffe rent treatment groups and the 
consistency of the respective treatment effects for all time points. 
The following SAS program code will be used  for the log-rank test and Kaplan-Meier 
estimates:

The relative risk reduction (RRR) will be es timated using a Cox proportional hazards (Cox 
PH) model, stratified by [CONTACT_47904][INVESTIGATOR_47875], with 
treatment as the only covariate. The poin t estimate and corresponding 95% confidence 
interval (CI) for the hazard ratio (HR, riva roxaban added to ASA vs . ASA alone) will be 
reported. The plausibility of proportional haza rds assumption will be assessed by [CONTACT_47905] a treatment by [CONTACT_47906]-transformed tim e interaction into the Cox PH model.

adjudicated.   
The statistical hypotheses for the secondary effi cacy outcomes are defined similarly as for the 
primary efficacy outcome. The analysis methods will be similar to those described for the 
primary efficacy outcome.  
6.2.7 Analysis of other efficacy variables 
The analysis of the other variab les will be based on the ITT an alysis set and ITT data scope, 
including events as adjudicated by [CONTACT_47907]. These analyses will be considered exploratory.  
The analysis methods will be similar to those described for the primary efficacy outcome 
except for patient reported outcomes.  
For EQ-5D and WIQ, the change from baseline of the mobility domain of EQ-5D and each 
domain of WIQ (pain [PAD specific question and Q1 of differential diagnosis], distance, speed, stair climbing) will be analyzed using an ANCOVA model with baseline value as a 
covariate and treatment as the only fixed effect. Baseline is the last measurement prior to or at 
randomization. 
For limb hemodynamics (ABI and TBI separate ly), the changes from baseline will be 
analyzed using an ANCOVA model with baseline value as a covariate and treatment as the 
only fixed effect. Since the ABI and TBI is  expected to improve after qualifying 
revascularization and decrease gradually over time, baseline value is defined as the 
measurement at month 1 visit. 
Summary statistics of EQ-5D, WIQ and ABI and TBI actual and change from baseline values 
will also be provided by [CONTACT_765]. 
6.2.8 Exploratory analysis 
Exploratory analysis of the individual components of the pr imary and secondary efficacy 
outcomes will be analyzed similarly to the primary efficacy outcome. Composite outcomes 
major adverse cardiac events (MACE, ie.  CV death, MI and ischemic stroke) and major adverse limb events (MALE, i.e.  ALI and  ma jor amputation due to a vascular etiology) will 
be analyzed similarly to the primary efficacy outcome. 
To account for the multiple components of the primary efficacy endpoint, all event analysis 
will be evaluated in ITT data scopes and on-treat ment data scopes by [CONTACT_47908] s as an extension of the Cox accounting for 
correlation of the events  within a subject (see Hougaard, 2000; Wienke, 2011; Austin, 2017), 
with treatment as the only cova riate. In addition, model with log-normal distribution of the 
shared frailty terms will be fitted. Another ex tension of the Cox model is the Andersen-Gill 
model, which assumes that each recu rrence is an independent event ( Andersen, 1982 ). To 
account for the intra-subject correlation, models with robust standard error estimator will be fitted according to Lin’s method ( Lin et al. 2000 ). 
The primary efficacy endpoint will be explored for the following subgroups 
Qualifying endovascul ar techniques  
o Balloon angioplasty (drug-coated  and not coated), yes/no 
 Statistical Analysis Plan   
 Protocol No.: BAY 59-7939 / [ZIP_CODE]  Page: 23 of 36
 
 o Angioplasty with stent (bare meta l, drug-coated, c overed) yes/no 
o Atherectomy 
o Thrombolysis 
 Time from qualifying revascularizati on procedure to randomization (<median; 
>=median) 
 History of lower limb amputation 
o Major ischemic amputation with or without other amputation 
o Minor ischemic amputation with or  without non-ischemic amputation 
o Nonischemic amputation only 
o No amputation 
The frequency will be presented descriptively (and  with forest plots). The hazard ratio for the 
treatment effect will be estimat ed separately within each level of a subgroup using the Cox 
proportional hazards model without stratification. 
The following variable will also be explored: 
 Time from randomization to the first occurrence of MI types  
 Any revascularization after randomization re gardless of the side as reported by [CONTACT_1275]  
 Any index leg revascularization as reported by [CONTACT_47909], ABI and TBI will be further explored  to understand the effect of natural history 
and drug effect on hemodynamics.  Examples include: 
 Change in ABI and TBI post randomizati on excluding values after subsequent 
revascularization by [CONTACT_6496] (endo vascular versus surgical)  
 Change in ABI and TBI post randomization in  patients with subsequent intervention 
versus those who do not under go subsequent intervention 
To explore the robustness of the treatment ef fect over time, landmark analyses will be 
performed for the primary endpoint according to landmark periods of randomization to 3-
month, 3-month to 1-year and 1-year to the end of treatment phase and randomization to 6-
month, 6-month to 1 year and 1-ye ar to end of treatment phase ( Van Houwelingen 2007). 
Additional time point after 1-year may be a dded depending on the actual study duration. For 
each landmark period, the hazard ratio will be es timated using a Cox PH model stratified by 
[CONTACT_47883][INVESTIGATOR_7745] (per IxRS  assignment) with treatment as the only 
covariate, the corresponding 95% CI will be provided, and Kaplan-Meier (KM) plot of cumulative risk will be generated, respectively.  The hazard ratio will also be calculated for 
the two main components (MACE versus MALE) of the primary endpoint.  
6.2.9 Subgroup analysis 
Patients with actual qualifying revascularization procedure 
In addition to the stratification based on the IxRS assignment, the study will be analyzed 
based on the actual qualifying revascularizati on procedure and actual clopi[INVESTIGATOR_47876]: 
 Statistical Analysis Plan   
 Protocol No.: BAY 59-7939 / [ZIP_CODE]  Page: 24 of 36
 
  surgical, 
 endovascular including h ybrid with clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745], 
 endovascular including hybrid without clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745]. 
Patients with hybrid procedures are classified as endovascular revascularization. We plan to 
determine the treatment effect among patie nts in each of the above strata (actual 
classification). Treatment groups will be compared using Cox proportional hazards model 
with treatment as a covariate for the primary (also the individual components) and secondary 
efficacy endpoints, using the ITT analysis set and ITT data scope. The point estimate and corresponding 95% CI for the hazard ratio (HR,  rivaroxaban added to ASA vs. ASA alone) 
will be reported. Additional analyses on other endpoints may be performed based on both per 
IxRS assignment and actual type of qualifying procedure and clopi[INVESTIGATOR_47868]. 
Other subgroups  The analyses for the other subgroups (as defined in section 6.2.4) will be performed based on 
the same analysis sets and data scopes as in  the main analyses for the primary efficacy 
outcome (also the individual components). The results will be presen ted descriptively (and 
with forest plots). The hazard ratio for the treatm ent effect will be estimated separately within 
each level of a subgroup variable using the Cox proportional hazards model stratified by [CONTACT_47910][INVESTIGATOR_47868] (per IxRS assignment) (except for subgroups related to 
qualifying revascularization proced ure or clopi[INVESTIGATOR_47868]) with treatment as a covariate.  
Additionally, homogeneity of trea tment effect in subgroups, both in magnitude and direction, 
will be assessed by [CONTACT_1583] a covariate for the subgroup variable and the corresponding 
treatment-subgroup interaction to the respective Cox proportional hazards model. This further 
investigation includes the likelihood ratio test proposed by [CONTACT_47911] ( Gail et al. 1985 ). 
As the number of subgroup analyses may be larg e, the probability of observing at least one 
spurious interaction is high de spi[INVESTIGATOR_1851] a biological or pharmacological basis for 
expecting an interaction. Thus, a ny interaction with a p-value below the 5% type I error level 
in the analysis of primary outcome will be interp reted as “flag” to prompt further investigation 
into the consistency of the pattern wi thin secondary and related outcomes. 
The analyses for the subgroups as defined in section 6.2.4 will also be performed based on the 
same analysis set and data scope as in the main analysis for the secondary efficacy outcomes (also the individual components). 
6.2.10  Sensitivity analyses  
To support the primary study results and to asse ss the robustness of the primary analysis, 
several sensitivity analyses will be performed. 
The primary efficacy variable will be analyzed  based on the ITT analysis set and ITT data 
scope 
 using the Cox proportional hazard model with actual stratification 
 using the Cox proportional hazard  model without stratification 
 Using a proportional hazards estimator that is robust to departur es from  proportional 
hazard ( Boyd et al. 2012 )

In addition, the secondary efficacy outcomes as adjudicated by [CONTACT_47914] (if applicable) will be 
analyzed using the same Cox PH model as described in section 6.2.[ADDRESS_50614] of missing data 
Although extensive effort will be made to redu ce the number of subjects with missing follow-
up, it is expected that there will be missing vital status and event information in some 
subjects. Subjects who are not followed up until  the ECOD (consent withdrawal, objection to 
further data collection, and lost  to follow up) before the development of primary efficacy 
events will be considered missing. Sensitivity analyses will be performed for th e primary efficacy endpoint based on the ITT 
analysis set and ITT data scope to evaluate the potential imp act of missing data on analysis 
results and robustness of study conclusions. To evaluate the plausibility of  informative censoring, distributi ons of baseline demographics 
and other characteristics will be compared be tween subjects with and without missing data, 
taking into account treatment and regardless of treatment.  Potential impact of missing data will be eval uated by [CONTACT_47915], where the event process will 
be imputed in missing follow-up periods (ie. time from last clinical event ascertainment date 
until ECOD in subjects without a primary efficacy endpoint prior to the ECOD). The 
robustness of the treatment effect with respect to missing data will be evaluated with a tippi[INVESTIGATOR_47877] (see Appendix C  for mathematical details). In this analysis, we will: 
1. Estimate the hazard at time of loss to follo w-up among subjects in ITT analysis set, 
adjusting for treatment group, stratificati on factors, and the following baseline 
covariates: 
 age (<65; ≥65 to <75; ≥ 75 years) 
 diabetes mellitus (yes, no) 
 prior coronary artery disease (yes, no) 
2. Inflate the hazard only in the rivaroxaban gr oup by a set of inflation factors; assuming 
non-informative censoring in the control group

 Protocol No.: BAY 59-7939 / [ZIP_CODE]  Page: [ADDRESS_50615] ratio and two-sided 95% CI using the 
primary Cox proportional model 
4. Given the study results is statistically signifi cant in favor of rivaroxaban, increase the 
inflation factor (by [CONTACT_47916] 2 and 3) until the upper limit of the two-sided 95% 
CI for the hazard ratio crosses 1.0; this will be the “tippi[INVESTIGATOR_11300]” 
The tippi[INVESTIGATOR_47878] r drop-out would need to be

In addition, the extent of missing information will be described by [CONTACT_47917] d rivaroxaban or rivaroxaban placebo follow-
up subject-years.

by [CONTACT_47918] (MedDRA) .  The version number of 
MedDRA used for the analyses will be stored in the clinical database. A listing will be provided linking the original investig ator terms and the coded terms. 
Analyses of reported adverse events will be performed based on the SAF and on-treatment data scope.   
In case of uncertainty (e.g., missing or incomplete dates), AEs will be classified as “treatment 
emergent” (TE) following the worst case approach.  
An overall summary of AEs and treatment-e mergent (TE) AEs (onl y considering study 
medication of rivaroxaban or rivaroxaban placebo) will be generated by [CONTACT_14459].  
Incidences of subjects with treatment emergent  adverse events (TEAEs ), drug-related and/or 
serious TEAEs, and TEAEs causing discontinuation of study drug will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_47919] (SOC) and Preferred Term

follow up will be tabulated. 
Serious adverse events (SAEs), AEs leading to  discontinuation and AEs of special safety 
interest (if applicable) will be listed.  The date , relative day (to start of study medication) and

compared using a Cox proportional hazards model st ratified by [CONTACT_47922][INVESTIGATOR_7745] (per IxRS assignment)  with treatment group as a cova riate. A plot of cumulative 
event rate derived by [CONTACT_5263]-Meier estimate will be provided to show event rate and 
treatment effect by [CONTACT_5586].  
The secondary safety outcome variables will be analyzed similarly. As supportive analyses, the primary safety variab le will be analyzed as described above based 
on the SAF and ITT data scope as well as  overall study duration including post-study 
treatment follow-up. In addition, the primary safety  variable will be analyzed according to the 
actual qualifying revascular ization procedure (section 6.2.9) and in subgroups as described in 
section 6.2.[ADDRESS_50618]’s pa rticipation in this study will 
be displayed.

 6.5 Other procedures and variables 
The other procedures and variables include: 
 Health care resource  utilization data  
 PAD symptom status 
For these variables, additional analyses other than those spec ified in sections 6.2.7 and 6.2.8 
may be performed and reported separately. 
6.6 Benefit/Risk Assessment 
The benefit-risk analyses are structured to allo w an integrated evaluation of the key benefits 
and risks in the study. They are complementary to  the efficacy and safety analyses described 
previously in this document and not intended for hypothesis testing. These analyses will be 
performed in patient populations with the same follow up. Details of these analyses will be described in a separate document (supplemental statistical analysis pl an for benefit-risk). 
The benefit-risk evaluation will be based on th e comparison of the time-to-first-event rates 
(rivaroxaban added to ASA vs. ASA alone), for ev ents intended to be prevented (benefits) and 
events that may be caused (risks). Individua l outcome measures balanced and weighed by 
[CONTACT_47923]-off between 
prevention of thrombotic vascular events versus harm (i.e. bleeding). These outcome measures include the individual component s of the primary efficacy outcome, risk 
measurements include the hemorrhagic even ts of the efficacy endpoint and bleedings 
according to TIMI classification. To have a co mprehensive benefit-risk evaluation, several 
quantification methods will be used.  
 Results of the above analysis do not preclude additional benefit/risk assessment in other 
endpoints. The overall benefit-risk profile of the study drug will be interpreted in 
consideration of the to tality of the data.

Note: The dates and timeline shown are for illustration purpose only. ECOD= Efficacy cut-off date, EOT Visit=end of treatment 
visit, PS-FU Visit=Post-study treatment fo llow-up visit (phone call), DBL=database lock 
The executive committee will monitor the accrual of the number of primary events, and when 
appropriate predict and define  an ECOD at which time the pre-defined target number of 
events for the primary composite endpoint ar e expected to have occurred. All randomized 
patients should return for their End of Treatment (EOT) visit after the ECOD.  
Events that occur after the ECOD will also be co llected and adjudicated. These events will be 
included in sensitivity analyses but not the primary analysis.  For the implementation of the censoring rules below variables are defined to distinguish 
between a patient’s last contact [CONTACT_47925]-death / 
all-cause mortality. 
 Date of objection to further data collection 
This date will be given only for those subj ects who expressed object ion to further data 
collection after withdrawal of informed consent.  
 Last clinical event ascertainment date 
The latest date from regular or unscheduled post-randomization visits  or contacts with 
assessment of clinical events or latest adjudicated clinical event start date.  
 Date of last contact [CONTACT_47926] w ith the subject or a third party (including 
data on subject survival status) derived from the maximum (last clinical event 
ascertainment date, SAEs date, vital status date, consent withdraw n date or date of

Appendix C: Mathematical Details of the Proposed Tippi[INVESTIGATOR_47881] a 
tippi[INVESTIGATOR_47882]. A methodology similar to pattern-
mixture-models will be employed, where a Wei bull survival model will be fitted to impute 
outcome for subjects who are lost-to-follo w-up (or withdrawn consent with no further 
information) (Little 2016 ).  
 
1. Estimate the hazard at time of loss to follow-up, adjusting for treatment group, covariates and stra tification factors  
 
a. The log survival time w=log(t) is m odeled using SAS LIFEREG procedure by 
[CONTACT_6486] a Weibull distribution to all su bjects, adjusting for treatment group, 
covariates and stratificat ion factors. The  survival function has the form 


 ww S exp exp ) (0
, 
where µ (differs for treatment, covariates, and stratum) and σ (scale) are estimated 
from the SAS output. 
 
b. Re-parametrize the Weibull distribu tion with survival function  
S (t) = exp (– (t/ λ) β), 
where λ is the scale parameter and β is the shape parameter. Obtain the estimates 
of λ and β  as 
      λ  = exp (µ) 
β = 1/σ. 
c. Obtain the observed hazard rate for individual subjects using th e hazard function  
h (t|λ, β) = (β/λ) (t/λ ) β-1.

non-informative censoring in the control group  
 
Let k be the inflation factor, the inflated hazard rate in the rivaroxaban group is 
h* (t|λ, β)  = k×(β/λ) (t/λ) β-1 
and the new scale parameter is  
λ* = λ/ (k1/β) 
by [CONTACT_47929] λ* from k×(β/λ) (t/λ) β-1 = (β/ λ*) (t/ λ*) β-1, while fixing the shape parameter 
β. 
The hazard rate in the control group remains unchanged. 
3. Perform simulations to impute events to th e end of the study using standard multiple 
imputation rules (Rubin 1987), and compute the hazard ra tio and two-sided 95% CI 
using the primary Cox proportional model 
 
For subjects who are lost-to-follow up (or w ithdrawn consent with no further information), 
and who did not experience a primary efficacy endpoint prior to the ECOD, random variables 
will be simulated using the conditional time to event distribution after the last contact [CONTACT_568] 
(LC) (defined as earlier date of last clinical ev ent ascertainment date, date of the objection to 
further data collection) given that no event was observed before.  
 
Let x be the time from the last contact [CONTACT_568] ( LC) to the event date, the conditional probability 
of having an event given no event observed before LC is

LC SLC x S
LC t PLC x tLC t LC xt LC t LC xt y
           
 
Using the estimated scale parameter λ* and shape parameter β from Weibull distribution in 
step 2, the above becomes 
y = 1– exp (– ((x+LC)/ λ*) β) / exp (– (LC/ λ*) β), 
    log (1–y) = – ((x+LC)/ λ*) β + (LC/λ*) β 
 x = λ*((LC/λ*) β – log (1–y)) 1/β – LC .  
If y is generated as a random variable with uniform distribution between [ADDRESS_50626] is re-adjusted to 
be censored at the ECOD.

 Protocol No.: BAY 59-7939 / [ZIP_CODE]  Page: [ADDRESS_50627] ratio with 95% CI will be es timated for each imputed data set and then 
combined using standard multiple imputation combining rules. 
 
4. Given the study results is statistically signifi cant in favor of rivaroxaban, increase the 
inflation factor (by [CONTACT_47916] 2 and 3) until the upper limit of the two-sided 95% 
CI for the hazard ratio crosses 1.0; this will be the “tippi[INVESTIGATOR_11300]”.

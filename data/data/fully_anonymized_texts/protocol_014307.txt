1  PROTOCOL: Improving Asthma Control in the Real World: A Systematic Approach to 
ImprovingDulera Adherence - a controlled stud y testing the effectiveness of an adult asthma 
adherence  disease  management  program  to improve  asthma  contro l by [CONTACT_617134]:  January 6, 2014 ,Version1 .0

SOURCES OF SUPPORT: Asthma Managemen t Systems (with an a ward from [COMPANY_006] ) 
 
1.0 Objective and Specific  Aims  
1) Enhance asthma control b y delivering the asthma adherence disease management  protoco ,l 
Asthma Adhe rencePath way™. 
 
2) Enhance adherence to Dulera relative to a clinica l benchmark by [CONTACT_617135],  Asthma  Adherence  Pathway™. 
3) Initiate validation of Adult Asthma Adherence Questionnaire  (AAAQ ) 
 
Hypotheses:  
Primary    Clinical   Hypothesis:   Poorly   controlled   subjects   with   moderate-to-sveere  asthma 
(measured by [CONTACT_617136] l Quest ionnaire (ACQ) 1) despi[INVESTIGATOR_617121], who are 
treated with the asthma adherence disease management protocol, Asthma Adherence 
Pathway™, will achieve greater asthma control than s imilar control subjects  who  are treated  
with thecurrent standard of  care.  
 
Primary end point: There will be four measures of Asthma Contro l Questionnaire (ACQ ) over 
time over [ADDRESS_819522] month measure of A CQ. 
 
Secondary Clinical H ypothesis: The asthma  adherence disease management program , Asthma 
Adherence Path way™, will increase observed adherence to Dulera relative to a benchmark of 
60% adherence ( i.e., expected prescribed actuations ). 
 
Secondary end points: a ) Average adhe rence to Dulera over the three month stud y period  
 
Tertiary Clinical Hypothes is: Responses t o Adult Asthma Adherence Questionna ire (AAAQ ) will 
be related to Dulera Adherence  
 
Tertiary Stud y Endpoints: There will be 2 measures of the AAAQ (first and last v isit) and the 
tertiary endpoint is the last visit

Protoco l Genti le Dulera Version  Date:  [ADDRESS_819524].5 However, 45-60% of patients do not adhere to 
preventivedrug regime ns.6 7· 8• Adherence rates for inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) range from 44% 
t7o8 72%7. But only 8% to 13% of patients taking ICS continue to fill prescript ions after one year. 
• It is difficul t for clinicians to determine whethe r treatmen t failure is due to an inadequate  
medication  regimen  or poor adherence , in part because  self-reported adhe rence is unreliab le.9 
Physicians may get a false  impression  of a drug's effect iveness  if a patient is not truthful  about 
medication  taken . Non-adherent  patients  are at risk for excess  morbid ity and mortality , as well 
as excess imaging, lab tests and consultations, due to the inability to accurately determinethe 
cause of treatment failure1.[ADDRESS_819525] a treatment mode ,l delivered by 
[CONTACT_617137] /Communicationskills , which may increase as thma control, 
impro ve adherence  to Dulera , and enhance  subjects' perception  of the effect iveness  of Dulera . 
The asthma adherence d isease managemen t (AADM ) intervention strategy consists of three 
components: 1 ) objective adherence monito ring; 2) identifica iton of barriers to treatmen ;t and 3 ) 
Motivat ional Intervie wing adhe rence strategies that address specific barriers .[ADDRESS_819526], NHLBI 
Expert  Panel  Report  3 (EPR-3) states  that adhe rence  monitoring  is a key component  of asthma 
manage ment, but no tes that the quality of the support ing data is weak, and encourages 
controlled tr ials to further e valuate the effectiveness of objective adhe rence monitoring.13 
Second , 56% of American Academy of Allerg y Asthma & Immunolog y membe rs responding to a 
survey , report  that they lackcompetency  managing  non-adherent  patients.[ADDRESS_819527] been tested inp romot ing asthma adherence and 
improv ing contro l. Milgrom  et al.9 as well as Onyrimba  et al.1 demonstrated  the effectiveness  of 
using  electronic  adherence  monitors  attached  to inhaled  corticos teroid  MDls  (ICS) to diagnose 
adherence status and impro ve adherence . Wilson et al demonstrated the effectiveness of  
shared -decision making , one type of patient -centered commu nication that has many features 
similar to Motiva tional Interv iewing, to improve asthma  contro l and adherence.[ADDRESS_819528]

An important  limitation  of both educational  and self-management  approaches  is that they are 
predicatedontheassumption  that patients aremotivated  to accept  treatment  recommendations. 
These approaches mi ht be effecitve for those who are ready to change but less so for those 
who are not ready .24• 2 Schma ling et al.26 for example , found that asthma education resulted in 
increased kno wledge but decreased mot ivation to use medicat ion. There is a need for 
innovative approaches to promote motivation for medication adherence that 1) build on 
previous ly validated interventions, 2 ) are easily integrated into standard c linica l care, and 3) 
target  both those  who are ready  and those  who are not ready  to change .

[CONTACT_617153] in was part of a research team that developed a 5 question adherence questionna ire 
for adults with asthma (Adu lt Asthma Adherence Questionnai re-AAAQ ).33 The stud y of 420 
subjects found that these 5 questions related to other measures of adherence and to asthma 
control can be used clinically to identify patients at risk of nonadherence and the specific 
adherence barriers involved.. Five items (Following my medication plan; forgetting ; not needing 
ICS; side effects ; and cost) were re lated to se lf-reported low adhe rence or previous ICS refill as 
well as asthma contro l (ACT). The AAAQ instrument will be used for the purposes of this 
research study . 
 
3.0 Research  Design and  Methods  
Study design:  
This study will make use of a cluster experimental design where repeated assessments over 
time are nested within patients and patients are nested within physician . Some cl inicians will be 
assigned to the treatment cond ition and some to the contro l group ( which will be pract icing the 
current s tandard of asthma care ). A total of 60 subjects will be enro lled in to the study.  
Subjects  being  seen  for regular asthma  care and who are beingprescr ibed Dulera 100/5 based 
upon asthma severity and dosing guide lines (and regard less of participation in this research 
study ) will be asked  to participate  in this research  study.  Also, these  subjects  with asthma  are 
routinelyprescribed  Proventil  HFA as their rescue  inhaler.  For the purposes  of the study , these 
medications (Dulera 100 /5 and Provent li HFA ) will be provided to all subjects as part of study 
participation.  
 
The subjects  will be assigned  to either  the intervent ion or control  group  at the time they sign the 
consent  form. These  subjects will be placedinto  their respective  groups  in an alternat ing

Dulera is a combination product conta ining a cort icosteroid and a long-actingbeta2 -adrenergic 
agonist , FDA approved and indica ted fo r treatment of as thma in pat ients 12 years of age and 
older. 
 
PROVENTIL® HFA Inhalation Aeroso l is FDA approved and indicated in adults and children [ADDRESS_819533]. Gentile 's 
office  and will be accessible  only to study staff. 
During  the course  of the study  (after  the screening ), bothstudy  drugs will include  Smartlnhaler 
adherence  moni tors. The Smartlnhaler  is FDA  approved  and will provide  electronic  data for 
recording and monitoring actuations of prescribed MDI usage . This electronic data will be 
downloaded  to a pass word-protected  compute r at the study  site. 
 
Motivational interv iewing : 
Prior to the patient management phase , clinicians will receive training in asthma adhe rence 
disease  management  strategies  as well as in Motivationa l Intervie wing to optimize  delivery  of 
the adherence intervent ions. They will be g iven a written test regarding 
adherence /communicationprinc iples prior to training  and at the end of the study.  The curriculum 
includes artic les, video examples and role-playing. Asthma Management Sys tems LLC has 
developed  and tested  a web-base d Asthma  Adhe rence  Disease  Program  (Asthma  Adherence 
Path way-SEE MEASURES BELOW ) which guides patients and clinic ians through the 
adherence  interventions.  (28) Patients identify  adhe rence  barrie rs from  the Asthma  Adherence 
Path way. The patients rece ive written and video feedback regard ing the sign ificance of  their 
concerns . This feedback  previews potential  strategies  which will be delivered  by [CONTACT_30223].  The 
clinician reviews the barriers identifie d by [CONTACT_102]. He/she is presented with links to 
Motivat ional Intervie wing Adhe rence Strategies, in both written and video formats . These 
strategies  serve  as prompts  for interven tions in the study  by [CONTACT_617138] a clinical decision 
support  system. Weinstein  will review  this mate rial at the training  sessions  and how to use it for 
subjects . 
 
Measures (see a/so adherence flowchart be low ): 
 
• ADHERENCE:  Dulera adherence  is calcu lated as the number  of actuations  measured  by 
[CONTACT_617139]  
o Definition of Dulera Adhe rence : Subjects  with 60% actuat ions during the 
interva l between cl inic visits  
o Definition of Du lera Nona dherence: Subjec ts with < 60% actuat ions du ring the 
interva l between  clinic visits  (Rationale  for 60% adherence  cut-off is to maximize 
asthma control. 60 % cut-off has been used by [CONTACT_617140] r et al (2006 ) as a 
suitable criterion of  adhe rence ). 
 
• ASTHMA CONTRO L QUESTIONNAIRE (ACQ) :29·  30 This brief questionna ire includes 
asthma symp toms, frequency of albu terol use and measureof pre-bronchodi lator FEV-1, 
Protoco l Genti le Dulera Version  Date:  20140106  
5  providing  7 elements  for analysis.  There  is a 1-6 likert  scale for each  item. The score is 
the mean  of the 7 responses . 
o WELL CONTROL LED: Scores 0.75 
o NOT WELL  CONTROLLED:  Scores  1.5 
o INDETERMINATE: Scores in between 0 .76 and  1.49  
• For the INDETERMINATE  group : asthma  control  will be determ ined by 
[CONTACT_617141]. 
• "Well contro lled" will be defined  as the use of the Provent il HFA 2 
inhalations 2 days pe r week during the interval not related to 
exercise  
• "Not well controlled " will be defined  as the use of the Provent liHFA  2 
inhalations 3 da ys per week during the interval not related to 
exercise  
 
• ASTHMA ADHERENC E PATHWAY:™ (completedby [CONTACT_617142]):  The Asthma 
Adhe rence Pathway™ (AAP) is a compute r-basedInterne ,t clinical decision support too l 
designed  to improve  adhe rence  to medication  and asthma  management  behaviors  that 
affect asthma control. The subject completes the Internet -based AAP at entry into the 
study. Th is permits rev iew by [CONTACT_617143]. The system recommends  
specific actions by [CONTACT_617144]'s input. The subject 
inputs attitu des and behaviors  about  disease  management  at the entry  of the study . The 
subject receives asthma and adherence educat ion in both written and video format to 
reinforce subsequent interventions by [CONTACT_195304] r. Prior to onset of the study the 
provider receives training to implement the Motivationa l Intervie wing Adherence 
Strategies  (MIAS)  that address  the specific concerns  of the subjects . The AAP provides 
the analysis of the subject's barriers in the form of "prompts " as a clinical decis ion 
making tool. It gives the provider recommendations on delivering MIAS that were 
presented in the earlier training . The adherence bar riers identified by [CONTACT_617145]  (11): 
o Ineffective management: not following the asthma medication plan; delaying 
treatment of symptoms; not removing self from an area causing symptoms; not 
following instructions  to treat an asthma  attack ; not measuring  peak  flow. 
o Negative attitudes about treatment: do not need medication; medic ine does not 
work. 
o Symptoms dur ing distressing emotional states: angry ; upset ; frustration; 
depress ion; anxiety. 
o Lack of comprehension of care instructions: uncertain when to use which 
medication;  not  understanding  how  to  use  prescribed  medication,  especial ly 
inhalat ion techn ique; not understand ing how to use a peak  flow meter . 
o Quality of life disruption : sleep , recrea tional activi ties, home activities, work, 
school.  
o Lack  of agreement  by [CONTACT_617146] t plan 
o Cost, side effects, forgetfulness. 
A  3-point  likert  scale  (Never,  Sometimes,  Often)  is  provided  for  patients  to  identify 
barriers. Those responses (Never or Often) depending on the wording of the question 
that denote  a "significant  barrier " will be reviewed by [CONTACT_13917].  The provi der uses  the 
recommen ded Motivationa l Interviewing Adhe rence Strategies contained within the 
software and presen ted in the training sessions . The Adult Asthma Adherence Path way 
has been  shown to have  preliminary  validation  for non-adherent  adults .14 
Protoco l Genti le Dulera Version  Date:  20140106  
6  • ADULT ASTHMA ADHERENCE QUESTIONNAIRE (AAAQ) (completed by  
[CONTACT_617147]): The AAAQ co nsists of five questio ns related to other measu res of 
adherence and to asthma control that can be used clinically , to ident ify patients at risk of 
nonadhe rence and the specific adherence barriers involved. It uses a [ADDRESS_819534] udies with the Smartlnhaler that will provide 
sufficient numbers to evaluate the validity of the AAAQ.

• subject consent  withdra wal 
Subjects  who withdra w because  of Dulera  or Provent li side effects  will receive  follow-up phone 
calls within 24 hours to evaluate need for further follo w-up care. All subjects who do not 
complete  the protocol  will be replaced . 
Concomitant treatments: During the course of the study , the use of any other orally inhaled 
stero id formu lations is prohibited , In addition, any medica itons that are known to have a drug  
interaction with Dulera are prohibited . Any other medicat ions are acceptable as long as dose 
remains  stable  over the course  of the study . If it becomes  necessary  for the subject  to begin  one 
of these  medications  or change  doses , they will be removed  from the study  and replaced.

10  4.0 Statistical  Considerations:  
 
Statistical power: The ACQ cons ists of 7 questions sca led from 0 (best asthma contro l) to 6 
(worst asthma contro l). Assum ing a large treatment effect (i.e., a difference of .[ADDRESS_819537] 
deviation  units  in the outcome ) reflecting  absolute  change  in the asthma  control  outcome,  small - 
to-modera te levels of intrac lass corre lation, [ADDRESS_819538] of the primary  hypothes is exceeds  .80. 
The power analys is is based  on a variance  estimate  of .70 and a score  change  of .5 in the ACQ 
being  a minimal  important  difference .31 The study  plans  to enroll  up to 60 subjects  as subjects 
who are non-comp liant will be replaced  to allow for 40 total to comp lete the study . 
 
Planned s tatistical analysis: The primary analysis of the four repeated measures of the Asthma 
Contro l Questionnaire (ACQ) over time over 3 months will done using linear or nonlinear mixed 
modeling (Fitzmaurice , Laird, & Ware, 2011 ) to determ ine whether  the intervention group 
demonstrates different average individual trajectories of change compared to the control group . 
The primary endpoin t is the third month measure of th e ACQ.  
Forthe  AAAQ  secondary  analysis , wewill compare  the observed  versus  expectedratios  (mean 
or median  depending  on the distribution ) in 1) patients  with a posit ive (abnormal ) response  to 
question  1 (responses  2-6) versus  those  without  a positive  response  (response  1); 
and 2) patients  with a positive (abnormal ) response  to any question  (QA: response  1-3; QB: 
response  1-4; QC: response  1-3; QD: response  1-3) versus  those  with no positive  responses : 
QA: 4-6; QB:4 -6; QC: 4-6; QD: 4-6. For the secondary  analysis  we will examine  changes  in the 
AAAQ o ver time (expressed as 0, 1, or 2 or more positive responses ) in relat ionship to the 
change  in observed  versus  expected  ratios  over time. The AAAQ  will be completed  atentry  into 
the study and at the conclusion at 3 months . Suitab le subjects in future studies that use 
electron ic adherence mon itors will also comp lete the AAAQ perm itting an attempt to validate 
this instrument.  
No interim stat istical ana lysis will be done prior to comple iton of all data collection . 
Missing  data considerations:  When  dealing  with missing data in a longitud inal study , restricting 
analyses  to make  use of only cases  with complete  repeatedly  measured  data can substantiall y 
bias statistical  findings . Assuming  data are missing at random  (MAR ) or missing  comp letely  at 
random  (MCAR ), multiple imputation  and full informationmaximum  likelihood  estimationare  two 
principled and recommended techn iques for dealing with missingness . We will be using 
statistical packages (i.e., SAS, Mplus ) that can accommodate missing data on the outcome 
variables  and make  use of all available  data for each  subject  in planned  analyses.  As noted  in 
the Research Design sect ion earlier , we will include in statistical analysis all subjects who 
complete  at leastthree  clinical visits  in either  the intervent ion or control  groups.  
 
4.1 Inclusion of Children in Research: Subjects ages 18 and under will not be included in this 
study as this is a preliminary study and a separate, age -specific study in ch ildren is warrantedin 
the future .

4.3 Recruitment  Procedures:  
Subjects will be recruited from the investigator 's patient practice population and referred by 
[CONTACT_617151] . Regardless of where sub jects are recruited , 
consenting  and all study  visits  and assoc iated procedures  will be performed  in a private  area in 
[CONTACT_617154] le's practice.  
 
Study  investigators  will obtain  written  informed consent  from the subject  before  complet ing any 
study procedures.  Subjects will be given ample time to review the consent and all questions will 
be answeredto  ensure  the subject's  understanding . 
 
4.4 Risk/BenefitRatio:  
This research study presents less than minimal r isk to the subject in that the probab ility and 
magnitude of harm or discomfort anticipated are not greater in and of those ordinarily 
encountered in daily life or during routine physical exams or tests . 
 
Risks of Du/era  
The most common side effects of DULERA include inflammation of the nose and throat , 
inflammation of the sinuses , and headache. Less common side effects of  Dulera  include:  
serious allergic reactions , thrush (yeast infection) in the mouth and throat , a higher chance of 
infect ion, reduced adrenal funct ion, increase in wheezing right after taking DULERA, lower bone 
mineral density, slowed growth in ch ildren, eye problems including glaucoma and cataracts, 
decrease  in blood potass ium and increase  in blood sugar  levels. 
 
Formotero l, one of the active ingredients in DULERA, increases the risk of asthma -related 
death . In pediatric  and adolescent  patients , formotero l may increase  the risk of asthma -related 
hosp italizat ion. It has not yet been determ ined whether the use of inhaled cort icostero ids (a 
component  of DULERA ) or other  long-term asthma -control  therapy  decreases  or eliminates  this 
risk. 
 
Risks of Proventil HFA  
Risks of Proventil HFA include fast heart rate and h igh blood pressure , nausea , dizziness , 
nervousness, difficulty sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], headache,  and a jittery or nervous feeling.   These symptoms 
Protoco l Genti le Du lera Version Date: [ADDRESS_819541]  has a disagreement with the 
physician about medication use (adherence ). Throughout the process , the subject will be 
queried  about  fatigue  and adequate  time will be allottedto  allow the subject  to rest. Open  and 
hones t dialogue with physician is encouraged; however subjects will not be required to answer 
any questions  that make  them  uncomfortable . 
 
Risks of Spi[INVESTIGATOR_617128] y, spi[INVESTIGATOR_23943] y may cause  some  dizziness , shortness  of breath , cough  or chest 
tightness . Subjects  will be treated  by a study  doctor  if these  occur.  
 
Risk of Un intentional Disclosure of your Pr ivate Hea lth Informatio n 
Another  potential  risk is anunintentional  disclosure  of privatehealth  information . However, this 
is very unlikel y because the study team has procedures in place to try to prevent this from 
happening . The informat ion collected will be stored in a locked office and on password 
protected  computers . 
 
Potential benefits  
While  there  are no direct  benefits  from partic ipation in the study, subjects  may receive  benefit 
from the study  medica tion when taken , may exper ienceimprovement  in their quality  of life and 
may improve  their medica iton adherence  for other  treatments . 
Protec iton Against Risk  
All assessments will be completed by [CONTACT_74562] /or ph ysicians trained in appropr iate 
administration   of   assessment   protocols   or   procedures.   Subjects   will   be   instructed   by 
[CONTACT_617152] /Proventil. Subjects will 
also be instructed to discontinue medication if side effects develop. 
 
Data Confiden itality and Integrity  
The data collected  will be used  for research  purposes  only, and participants  will be identifiedb y 
code designat ion. All data collected for this project will be kept strictly confident ial and will be 
kept in a locked cab inet or room . All data will be cata logued using the participant's stud y ID 
number. All research staff members are required to respect the confidentiality of participants 
and to complete  institut ionall y required  subject  protection  training.  
Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
The principal investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_617129] y at the time of continu ing 
review to assess adequac y of procedures and to ensure subject pri vacy, research 
confidentialit y, data quality, and stud y procedu res. Also to be assessed are study goals and 
modifications of those  goals ; subject  recruitment , accrual  and retent ion, progress  in data coding 
and analysis, documenta iton, identifica iton of adverse events or research subject comp laints , 
and any issues or concerns at that time. Also, assessment will be made of externa l factors or 
relevant  information  that may have an impact  on the safety  of study participants  or the ethics of 
the research  study .

1.0 Objective and Specific  Aims  
1) Enhance asthma control b y delivering the asthma adherence disease management  protoco ,l 
Asthma Adhe rencePath way™. 
 
2) Enhance adherence to Dulera relative to a clinica l benchmark by [CONTACT_617135],  Asthma  Adherence  Pathway™. 
3) Initiate validation of Adult Asthma Adherence Questionnaire  (AAAQ ) 
 
Hypotheses:  
Primary    Clinical   Hypothesis:   Poorly   controlled   subjects   with   moderate-to-sveere  asthma 
(measured by [CONTACT_617136] l Quest ionnaire (ACQ) 1) despi[INVESTIGATOR_617121], who are 
treated with the asthma adherence disease management protocol, Asthma Adherence 
Pathway™, will achieve greater asthma control than s imilar control subjects  who  are treated  
with thecurrent standard of  care.  
 
Primary end point: There will be four measures of Asthma Contro l Questionnaire (ACQ ) over 
time over [ADDRESS_819552] month measure of A CQ. 
 
Secondary Clinical H ypothesis: The asthma adherence disease management program , Asthma 
Adherence Path way™, will increase observed adherence to Dulera relative to a benchmark of 
60% adherence ( i.e., expected prescribed actuations ). 
 
Secondary end points: a ) Average adhe rence to Dulera over the three month stud y period  
 
Tertiary Clinical Hypothes is: Responses t o Adult Asthma Adherence Questionna ire (AAAQ ) will 
be related to Dulera Adherence  
 
Tertiary Stud y Endpoints: There will be 2 measures of the AAAQ (first and last v isit) and the 
tertiary endpoint is the last visit

• It is difficul t for clinicians to determine whethe r treatmen t failure is due to an inadequate  
medication  regimen  or poor adherence , in part because  self-reported adhe rence is unreliab le.9 
Physicians may get a false  impression  of a drug's effect iveness  if a patient is not truthful  about 
medication  taken . Non-adherent  patients  are at risk for excess  morbid ity and mortality , as well 
as excess imaging, lab tests and consultations, due to the inability to accurately determinethe 
cause of treatment failure1.[ADDRESS_819555] a treatment mode ,l delivered by 
[CONTACT_617137] /Communicationskills , which may increase as thma control, 
impro ve adherence  to Dulera , and enhance  subjects' perception  of the effect iveness  of Dulera . 
The asthma adherence d isease managemen t (AADM ) intervention strategy consists of three 
components: 1 ) objective adherence monito ring; 2) identifica iton of barriers to treatmen ;t and 3 ) 
Motivat ional Intervie wing adhe rence strategies that address specific barriers .[ADDRESS_819556], NHLBI 
Expert  Panel  Report  3 (EPR-3) states  that adhe rence  monitoring  is a key component  of asthma 
manage ment, but no tes that the quality of the support ing data is weak, and encourages 
controlled tr ials to further e valuate the effectiveness of objective adhe rence monitoring.13

An important  limitation  of both educational  and self-management  approaches  is that they are 
predicatedontheassumption  that patients aremotivated  to accept  treatment  recommendations. 
These approaches mi ht be effecitve for those who are ready to change but less so for those 
who are not ready .24• 2 Schma ling et al.26 for example , found that asthma education resulted in 
increased kno wledge but decreased mot ivation to use medicat ion. There is a need for 
innovative approaches to promote motivation for medication adherence that 1) build on 
previous ly validated interventions, 2 ) are easily integrated into standard c linica l care, and 3) 
target  both those  who are ready  and those  who are not ready  to change .

for adults with asthma (Adu lt Asthma Adherence Questionnai re-AAAQ ).33 The stud y of 420 
subjects found that these 5 questions related to other measures of adherence and to asthma 
control can be used clinically to identify patients at risk of nonadherence and the specific 
adherence barriers involved.. Five items (Following my medication  plan; forgetting ; not needing 
ICS; side effects ; and cost) were re lated to se lf-reported low adhe rence or previous ICS refill as 
well as asthma contro l (ACT). The AAAQ instrument will be used for the purposes of this 
research study . 
 
3.0 Research Design and  Methods  
Study design:  
This study will make use of a cluster experimental design where repeated assessments over 
time are nested within patients and patients are nested within physician . Some cl inicians will be 
assigned to the treatment cond ition and some t o the contro l group ( which will be pract icing the 
current s tandard of asthma care ). A total of 60 subjects will be enro lled in to the study.  
Subjects  being  seen  for regular asthma  care and who are beingprescr ibed Dulera 100/5 based 
upon asthma severity and dosing guide lines (and regard less of participation in this research 
study ) will be asked  to participate  in this research  study.  Also, these  subjects  with asthma  are 
routinelyprescribed  Proventil  HFA as their rescue  inhaler.  For the purposes  of the study , these 
medications (Dulera 100 /5 and Provent li HFA ) will be provided to all subjects as part of study 
participation.  
 
The subjects  will be assigned  to either  the intervent ion or control  group  at the time they sign the 
consent  form. These  subjects will be placedinto  their respective  groups  in an alternat ing

recording and monitoring actuations of prescribed MDI usage . This electronic data will be 
downloaded  to a pass word-protected  compute r at the study  site. 
 
Motivational interv iewing : 
Prior to the patient management phase , clinicians will receive training in asthma adhe rence 
disease  management  strategies  as well as in Motivationa l Intervie wing to optimize  delivery  of 
the adherence intervent ions. They will be g iven a written test regarding 
adherence /communicationprinc iples prior to training  and at the end of the study.  The curriculum 
includes artic les, video examples and role-playing. Asthma Management Sys tems LLC has 
developed  and tested  a web-base d Asthma  Adhe rence  Disease  Program  (Asthma  Adherence 
Path way-SEE MEASURES BELOW ) which guides patients and clinic ians through the 
adherence  interventions.  (28) Patients identify  adhe rence  barrie rs from  the Asthma  Adherence 
Path way. The patients rece ive written and video feedback regard ing the sign ificance of  their 
concerns . This feedback  previews potential  strategies  which will be delivered  by [CONTACT_30223].  The 
clinician reviews the barriers identifie d by [CONTACT_102]. He/she is presented with links to 
Motivat ional Intervie wing Adhe rence Strategies, in both written and video formats . These 
strategies  serve  as prompts  for interven tions in the study  by [CONTACT_617138] a clinical decision 
support  system. Weinstein  will review  this mate rial at the training  sessions  and how to use it for 
subjects . 
 
Measures (see a/so adherence flowchart be low ): 
 
• ADHERENCE:  Dulera adherence  is calcu lated as the number  of actuations  measured  by 
[CONTACT_617139]  
o Definition of Dulera Adhe rence : Subjects  with 60% actuat ions during the 
interva l between cl inic visits  
o Definition of Du lera Nona dherence: Subjec ts with < 60% actuat ions du ring the 
interva l between  clinic visits  (Rationale  for 60% adherence  cut-off is to maximize 
asthma control. 60 % cut-off has been used by [CONTACT_617140] r et al (2006 ) as a 
suitable criterion of  adhe rence ).

• ASTHMA ADHERENC E PATHWAY:™ (completedby [CONTACT_617142]):  The Asthma 
Adhe rence Pathway™ (AAP) is a compute r-basedInterne ,t clinical decision support too l 
designed  to improve  adhe rence  to medication  and asthma  management  behaviors  that 
affect asthma control. The subject completes the Internet -based AAP at entry into the 
study. Th is permits rev iew by [CONTACT_617143]. The system recommends  
specific actions by [CONTACT_617144]'s input. The subject 
inputs attitu des and behaviors  about  disease  management  at the entry  of the study . The 
subject receives asthma and adherence educat ion in both written and video format to 
reinforce subsequent interventions by [CONTACT_195304] r. Prior to onset of the study the 
provider receives training to implement the Motivationa l Intervie wing Adherence 
Strategies  (MIAS)  that address  the specific concerns  of the subjects . The AAP provides 
the analysis of the subject's barriers in the form of "prompts " as a clinical decis ion 
making tool. It gives the provider recommendations on delivering MIAS that were 
presented in the earlier training . The adherence bar riers identified by [CONTACT_617145]  (11): 
o Ineffective management: not following the asthma medication plan; delaying 
treatment of symptoms; not removing self from an area causing symptoms; not 
following instructions  to treat an asthma  attack ; not measuring  peak  flow. 
o Negative attitudes about treatment: do not need medication; medic ine does not 
work. 
o Symptoms dur ing distressing emotional states: angry ; upset ; frustration; 
depress ion; anxiety. 
o Lack of comprehension of care instructions: uncertain when to use which 
medication;  not  understanding  how  to  use  prescribed  medication,  especial ly 
inhalat ion techn ique; not understand ing how to use a peak  flow meter .

6  • ADULT ASTHMA ADHERENCE QUESTIONNAIRE (AAAQ) (completed by  
[CONTACT_617147]): The AAAQ co nsists of five questio ns related to other measu res of 
adherence and to asthma control that can be used clinically , to ident ify patients at risk of 
nonadhe rence and the specific adherence barriers involved. It uses a [ADDRESS_819564] udies with the Smartlnhaler that will provide 
sufficient numbers to evaluate the validity of the AAAQ.  
 
VISIT PROCEDURES  
 
Screening visit (all subiects) - approximately 2 hours:

10  4.0 Statistical  Considerations:  
 
Statistical power: The ACQ cons ists of 7 questions sca led from 0 (best asthma contro l) to 6 
(worst asthma contro l). Assum ing a large treatment effect (i.e., a difference of .[ADDRESS_819567] 
deviation  units  in the outcome ) reflecting  absolute  change  in the asthma  control  outcome,  small - 
to-modera te levels of intrac lass corre lation, [ADDRESS_819568] of the primary  hypothes is exceeds  .80. 
The power analys is is based  on a variance  estimate  of .70 and a score  change  of .5 in the ACQ 
being  a minimal  important  difference .31 The study  plans  to enroll  up to 60 subjects  as subjects 
who are non-comp liant will be replaced  to allow for 40 total to comp lete the study . 
 
Planned s tatistical analysis: The primary analysis of the four repeated measures of the Asthma 
Contro l Questionnaire (ACQ) over time over 3 months will done using linear or nonlinear mixed 
modeling (Fitzmaurice , Laird, & Ware, 2011 ) to determ ine whether  the intervention group 
demonstrates different average individual trajectories of change compared to the control group . 
The primary endpoin t is the third month measure of th e ACQ.  
Forthe  AAAQ  secondary  analysis , wewill compare  the observed  versus  expectedratios  (mean 
or median  depending  on the distribution ) in 1) patients  with a posit ive (abnormal ) response  to 
question  1 (responses  2-6) versus  those  without  a positive  response  (response  1); 
and 2) patients  with a positive (abnormal ) response  to any question  (QA: response  1-3; QB: 
response  1-4; QC: response  1-3; QD: response  1-3) versus  those  with no positive  responses : 
QA: 4-6; QB:4 -6; QC: 4-6; QD: 4-6. For the secondary  analysis  we will examine  changes  in the 
AAAQ o ver time (expressed as 0, 1, or 2 or more positive responses ) in relat ionship to the 
change  in observed  versus  expected  ratios  over time. The AAAQ  will be completed  atentry  into 
the study and at the conclusion at 3 months . Suitab le subjects in future studies that use 
electron ic adherence mon itors will also comp lete the AAAQ perm itting an attempt to validate 
this instrument.  
No interim stat istical ana lysis will be done prior to comple iton of all data collection . 
Missing  data considerations:  When  dealing  with missing data in a longitud inal study , restricting 
analyses  to make  use of only cases  with complete  repeatedly  measured  data can substantiall y 
bias statistical  findings . Assuming  data are missing at random  (MAR ) or missing  comp letely  at 
random  (MCAR ), multiple imputation  and full informationmaximum  likelihood  estimationare  two 
principled and recommended techn iques for dealing with missingness . We will be using 
statistical packages (i.e., SAS, Mplus ) that can accommodate missing data on the outcome 
variables  and make  use of all available  data for each  subject  in planned  analyses.  As noted  in 
the Research Design sect ion earlier , we will include in statistical analysis all subjects who 
complete  at leastthree  clinical visits  in either  the intervent ion or control  groups.  
 
4.1 Inclusion of Children in Research: Subjects ages 18 and under will not be included in this 
study as this is a preliminary study and a separate, age -specific study in ch ildren is warrantedin 
the future . 
4.2 Inclusion /Exclusion  Criteria:  
Inclusion  Criteria  
1. Physician diagnosis of asthma of  moderateseverity

pulmonary  hypertension  or lung cancer  
4. On any medica iton documented to have a druginteraction with Dulera  
 
4.3 Recruitment  Procedures:  
Subjects will be recruited from the investigator 's patient practice population and referred by 
[CONTACT_617151] . Regardless of where sub jects are recruited , 
consenting  and all study  visits  and assoc iated procedures  will be performed  in a private  area in 
[CONTACT_617154] le's practice.  
 
Study  investigators  will obtain  written  informed consent  from the subject  before  complet ing any 
study procedures.  Subjects will be given ample time to review the consent and all questions will 
be answeredto  ensure  the subject's  understanding . 
 
4.4 Risk/BenefitRatio:  
This research study presents less than minimal r isk to the subject in that the probab ility and 
magnitude of harm or discomfort anticipated are not greater in and of those ordinarily 
encountered in daily life or during routine physical exams or tests . 
 
Risks of Du/era  
The most common side effects of DULERA include inflammation of the nose and throat , 
inflammation of the sinuses , and headache. Less common side effects of  Dulera  include:  
serious allergic reactions , thrush (yeast infection) in the mouth and throat , a higher chance of 
infect ion, reduced adrenal funct ion, increase in wheezing right after taking DULERA, lower bone 
mineral density, slowed growth in ch ildren, eye problems including glaucoma and cataracts, 
decrease  in blood potass ium and increase  in blood sugar  levels. 
 
Formotero l, one of the active ingredients in DULERA, increases the risk of asthma -related 
death . In pediatric  and adolescent  patients , formotero l may increase  the risk of asthma -related 
hosp italizat ion. It has not yet been determ ined whether the use of inhaled cort icostero ids (a 
component  of DULERA ) or other  long-term asthma -control  therapy  decreases  or eliminates  this 
risk. 
 
Risks of Proventil HFA  
Risks of Proventil HFA include fast heart rate and h igh blood pressure , nausea , dizziness , 
nervousness, difficulty sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], headache,  and a jittery or nervous feeling.   These symptoms 
Protoco l Genti le Du lera Version Date: [ADDRESS_819571]  has a disagreement with the 
physician about medication use (adherence ). Throughout the process , the subject will be 
queried  about  fatigue  and adequate  time will be allottedto  allow the subject  to rest. Open  and 
hones t dialogue with physician is encouraged; however subjects will not be required to answer 
any questions  that make  them  uncomfortable . 
 
Risks of Spi[INVESTIGATOR_617128] y, spi[INVESTIGATOR_23943] y may cause  some  dizziness , shortness  of breath , cough  or chest 
tightness . Subjects  will be treated  by a study  doctor  if these  occur.  
 
Risk of Un intentional Disclosure of your Pr ivate Hea lth Informatio n 
Another  potential  risk is anunintentional  disclosure  of privatehealth  information . However, this 
is very unlikel y because the study team has procedures in place to try to prevent this from 
happening . The informat ion collected will be stored in a locked office and on password 
protected  computers . 
 
Potential benefits  
While  there  are no direct  benefits  from partic ipation in the study, subjects  may receive  benefit 
from the study  medica tion when taken , may exper ienceimprovement  in their quality  of life and 
may improve  their medica iton adherence  for other  treatments . 
Protec iton Against Risk  
All assessments will be completed by [CONTACT_74562] /or ph ysicians trained in appropr iate 
administration   of   assessment   protocols   or   procedures.   Subjects   will   be   instructed   by 
[CONTACT_617152] /Proventil. Subjects will 
also be instructed to discontinue medication if side effects develop. 
 
Data Confiden itality and Integrity  
The data collected  will be used  for research  purposes  only, and participants  will be identifiedb y 
code designat ion. All data collected for this project will be kept strictly confident ial and will be 
kept in a locked cab inet or room . All data will be cata logued using the participant's stud y ID 
number. All research staff members are required to respect the confidentiality of participants 
and to complete  institut ionall y required  subject  protection  training.  
Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
The principal investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_617129] y at the time of continu ing 
review to assess adequac y of procedures and to ensure subject pri vacy, research 
confidentialit y, data quality, and stud y procedu res. Also to be assessed are study goals and 
modifications of those  goals ; subject  recruitment , accrual  and retent ion, progress  in data coding 
and analysis, documenta iton, identifica iton of adverse events or research subject comp laints , 
and any issues or concerns at that time. Also, assessment will be made of externa l factors or 
relevant  information  that may have an impact  on the safety  of study participants  or the ethics of 
the research  study . 
 
5.0 Costs and  Payments  
Protoco l Genti le Du lera Version Date: 20140106  
13  5.1 Research Study Costs: Neither the participant , nor his/her insurance provider  will  be 
charged for the costs of any of the procedures performed for the purpose of this research study

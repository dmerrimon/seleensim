 1 Introduction  
 
This document is a protocol for a human research study. This study will be carried out in accordance with the procedures described in this protocol, applicable U nited States  
government regulations and Mayo Clinic policies and procedures.  
1.1 Background 
 
The global rise in the prevalence of overweight and obesity among all ages and ethnic groups has become an epi[INVESTIGATOR_792882] m edical practices everywhere. The prevalence of 
pediatric obesity in the [LOCATION_002] defined by a body mass index (BMI)  measurement of ≥ 
95% or greater than [ADDRESS_1093109] deviation (SD) age has increased from 4.2% 1965 to 17.6% now. This significant increase in pediatric obesity is  becoming a major health problem in 
[LOCATION_002]. [1-3] The contributory causes of this rapid increase are mul tifactorial including 
metabolic dysregulation, genes, environmental/socioeconomic stressors, and ene rgy 
imbalance. [4]  Pediatric obesity is  known to be  associated with increased mo rbidity and 
predisposes adol escents  to become obese adult with long term complications. Obese children  
and adolescents are at increased risk for obstructive sleep apnea, metab olic syndrome, 
orthopedic disorders, hypertension, type 2 diabetes  mellitus (DM2) , and fatty infiltration into 
the liver that can range from  nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) to nonalcoholic 
steatohepatitis (NASH)  and cirrhosis . [5, 6] These comorbidities are also clearly associated 
with significant increase in outpatient visits, prescription drug use , and emergency room visits , 
resulting in decrease quality of life for these adolescents  and significant increase medical care 
cost. [7]  In view of the magnitude of the pediatric obesity problems, many centers are 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_792883]- term complications. The current generalized approach usually includes changes in 
lifestyle, diet, and physical activity.[ 8] The challenge to t his approach is that persistent lifestyle 
changes are difficult to achieve and long- term results are often disappointing.[ 9, 10] For all of 
these reasons, adolescents are increasingly undergoing surgical treatment for obesity, and systematic data collection in bariatric  programs is needed to further shape adolescent bariatric 
surgery guidelines.[ 11]  The paucity of long- term outcome and special ethical consideration 
created a major limitation to establishing unified indications and criteria for bariatr ic 
intervention in adolescents.[ 12] New research is underway with the intent to produce specific 
recommendations and guidelines for bariatric intervention in adolescents, based on numerous positive publications regarding the clinical impact of bariatric intervention  on the early -onset 
obesity- related diseases. [13-16] 
1.2 Investigational Device  
 The Orbera  (Apollo Endosurgery, Austin, TX)  is an elastic spherical balloon made of silicone, 
filled with 550 mL of saline solution, and is FDA approved for weight loss in adult US patients 
with body mass index between 30 to 40 kg/m
2.  The deflated balloon comes preloaded on a 
catheter, which is bl indly advanced trans -orally into the stomach. An endoscope is then 
advanced alongside it to ensure accurate placement of the balloon in the fundus. Under direct visualization, the balloon is then inflated by [CONTACT_792910]. The Orbera balloon is currently used outside the [LOCATION_002] including

1.3 Preclinical Data  
 
See PMA study of the Orbera intragastric balloon.  
1.4 Clinical Data to Date 
 
The Orbera ™ Intragastric Balloon (Apollo Endosurgery, Austin, TX), previously known as 
the BioEnterics Intragastric Balloon (BIB) (Allergan, Irvine, CA) is an elastic spherical balloon made from silicone, filled with about 600 ml of saline and is placed in the stomach via upper endoscopy. This intragastric balloon ( IGB) is designed to stay in place for [ADDRESS_1093110] with excellent safety profile. In an  American Society of Ga stroenterology and Endoscopy 
(ASGE ) Bariatric Endoscopy Task Force systematic review and meta- analysis the pooled 
percentage of  total body weight loss  (TBWL ) after the Orbera IGB implantation was 12.3% 
(95% CI, 7.91–16.73), 13.16% (95% CI, 12.37–13.95), and 11.27% (95% CI, 8.17–14.36) at 3, 6, and 12 months af ter implantation, respectively. [18] This was based on a review of 55 
studies. This balloon is currently FDA approved for use in the [LOCATION_002] after a US randomized multicenter pi[INVESTIGATOR_792886].  There is paucity of data 
about the use of IGB in adolescents . Despi[INVESTIGATOR_792887] , high relapse rate s of current 
approaches  and minima l adverse events of IGB can justify this nonsurgical  bariatric 
interventions.[ 19]  A recent pi[INVESTIGATOR_792888] a feasible and safe intervention 
in obese adolescents  resulting in weight loss and improvement in their metabolic syndrome. 
[17] Another important application to this intervention comes from the noticeable increase in  
the incidence NAFLD and NASH in adolescents  is increasing , resulting in significant 
morbidity and long- term complications such as  liver fibrosis  and cirrhosis .[20] Neuman et al, 
suggested that bariatric procedures including noninvasive ones such as IGB intervention can 
resolve the liver involvement and prevent further complications.[ 21]  
 Another application comes from the growing evidence regarding the  epi[INVESTIGATOR_792889]2  in 
adolescents  and its  multisystem health complications,  but treatment options have lagged 
behind. Disease  progression in adolescents  occurs despi[INVESTIGATOR_792890]2. All of that evidence resul ted in i ncreased  
interest in the application of bariatric intervention for adolescents with DM2  and morbid 
obesity. This was the recommendation of recent review by [CONTACT_792911], who recommended bariatric intervention  because of the evidence demonstrating imp rovement or remission in 
many adults with diabetes after bariatric intervention. [ 22] 
 
The rates of adverse events after implantation of the Orbera balloon are pooled from a manual review of 6 8 studies (8500 implantations) and are summarized in Figure 1. Pain and nausea 
are frequent side- effects after Orbera balloon implantation, occurring in up to 33.7% of 
subjects. Medications such as proton pump inhibitors, antispasmodic drugs, and antiemetics 
are usually prescribed prophylactically before, during, and after balloon placement to prevent

 or minimize these  expected common side effects. Serious side -effects with Orbera balloon are 
rare with an i ncidence of migration and gastric perforation of 1.4% and 0.1%, respectively. 
Most of the reported perforations with the Orbera were in patients who had undergone previous 
gastric surgeries , which is a contraindication for use in the US.[ 18]  
1.5 Study Rationale and Risk/Benefits  
1.5.1 Study Rationale 
 Recent advances in the endoscopic bariatric therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (EBTs) provided an alternative effective 
and minimally invasive treatment approach to obesity that would increase treatment options beyond surgery, medications, and lifestyle measures. Due to the special ethical consideration of involving minors in empi[INVESTIGATOR_792891], the reversible EBTs might be more viable option for managing obesity in adolescents and prevent long- term complications. One of the EBT 
approaches is the intragastric balloon (IGB) which involves  an endoscopic device for 
temporary nonpharmaceutical and nonsurgi cal treatment for morbid obesity. [23] The O rbera  
Intragastric Balloon (IGB) (Apollo Endo- surgery , Austin, TX)  is an elastic spherical balloon 
made from silicone, filled with about [ADDRESS_1093111] with excellent safety profile. A recent review and metaanalysis by [CONTACT_792912], of 8506 IGB implantation showed that IGB resulted in significant weig ht loss (up to 15%) with serious adverse events rate of  0.3-0.1% 
mostly in patient with prior gastric surgery.[ 24] Recent trials in adolescents with obesity have 
confirmed  the safety and feasibility of using the IGB as a weight management tool in 
adolescents with morbid obesity.[ 15, 16] As discussed above , IGB could also be useful in 
treating NAFLD, NASH and DM2 in  adolescents . 
1.5.2 Anticipated Risks  
 The rates of adverse events after implantation of the Orbera balloon are pooled from a manual review of 6 8 studies (8500 implantations) and are summarized in Figure 1. Pain and nausea 
are frequent side- effects after Orbera balloon implantation, occurring in up to 33.7% of 
subjects. Medications such as proton pump inhibitor s, an tispasmodic drugs, and antiemetics 
are usually prescribed prophylactically before, during, and after balloon placement to prevent or minimize these  expected common side effects. Serious side -effects with Orbera balloon are 
rare with an incidence of migrati on and gastric perforation of 1.4% and 0.1%, respectively. 
Most of the reported perforations with the Orbera were in patients who had undergone previous gastric surgeries , which is a contraindication for use in the US.[ 18]

Figure 1. Pooled Orbera Complications from 68 studies (8500 patients) [ 24] 
 
As with all endoscopic and/or implant procedures, serious injury or death can occur. With any 
device, there is always a chance of developi[INVESTIGATOR_792892]. Not all risks or problems associated with the use of the Orbera  Intragastric Balloon are known. Common risks 
that can occur include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and bad breath . This is expected due to the physical presence of the balloon in the subject’s  
stomach. Anti -nausea medications may be given on the procedure day and should help with 
any nausea and vomiting that the subject  may have. The side effects and risks of the medication 
the subject  may be prescribed w ill be discussed with the subject  by [CONTACT_9154] ([CONTACT_792956]) 
prior to the balloon procedure.   Per the Orbera Directions For Use (revision 2),  possible complications from the use of 
ORBERA IGB include:  
• Intestinal obstruction by [CONTACT_792913] 
• Death due to complications related to intestinal obstruction  
• Esophageal obstruction which could require surgery or endoscopic removal of the balloon 
• Gastric outlet obstruction  which could require surgical removal of the balloon 
• Injury to the digestive tract during placement of the balloon in an improper location 
which could cause bleeding and perforation and in turn could require surgical 
correction  
• Insufficient or no weight loss 
• Adverse health consequences resulting from weight loss 
• Gastric discomfort, feelings of nausea and vomiting following balloon placement

 • Continuing nausea and vomiting or possibly the prevention of vomiting 
• A feeling of heaviness in the abdomen 
• Abdominal or back pain, either steady or cyclic 
• Gastroesophageal reflux  
• Influence on digestion of food 
• Blockage of food entering into the stomach 
• Bacterial growth in the fluid which fills the balloon which could cause infection, 
fever, cramps, and diarrhea  
• Injury to the lining of the digestive tract as a result of direct contact [CONTACT_792914], graspi[INVESTIGATOR_204232], or as a result of increased acid production by [CONTACT_792915] 
• Death due to complications related to gastric or esophageal perforation 
• Balloon deflation and subsequent replacement 
• Acute pancreatitis  
• Spontaneous over inflation 
Possible risks which may occur from the subject’s  endoscopy procedure include difficulty 
swallowing, injury to the lining of the esophagus or stomach, perforation (a hole in the wall of 
your stomach or esophagus), bleeding, infection, inflammation, dental injury, pain following 
the procedure with the potential for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_792893], post procedure fl uid 
collection with or without abscess or death.   The risk of monitored controlled sedations medications used to make the subject  drowsy can 
cause breathing difficulties or a drop in blood pressure. These side effects are easily observed and managed by [CONTACT_3433] e anaesthesia team.  These medications may cause some inflammation at the 
intravenous site where the drugs are given  again that will be discussed and explained by [CONTACT_792916].   If any gastric ulceration were identified at the time IGB removal after [ADDRESS_1093112] s will be followed clinically until complete resolution.  
1.5.3 Potential Benefits  
 
The Orbera intragastric balloon is expected to result in 12.3%, 13.16 and 11.27% total body 
weight loss (TBWL) at 3, 6, and 12 months after implantation, respectively , based on recent 
review .[18] This balloon is currently FDA approved for use  in adults  in the [LOCATION_002] . 
Other potential benefits include improving the metabolic syndrome manifestation such as :  
1. Sustainable decrease in baseline heart rate (>10 beats/min) and systolic blood 
pressure (>10 mmg/hg) 
2. Normalization of liver function panel 
3. Decrease in fatty liver infiltration on liver ultrasound (US)  
4. Decrease in H g1Ac level

2 Study Objectives  
 
Primary Objective:  
 
Assess the safety and effectiveness  of an intragastric balloon device in obese adolescent 
subjects  with comorbidities  to assist with  weight reduction and reverse metabolic 
complications . 
 The intended use for the subject device (IGB) in adolescents is to induce > 10% total body weight loss in morbidly obese adolescents.  
Specific Aims:  
 
• Determine if placement of IGB for a period of 6 months is safe and results in weight loss and metabolic improvement in obese adolescents 
• Determine if intragastric balloon is well tolerated by [CONTACT_65754]  
• Determine if weight loss is sustainable after the IGB removal through integrating the subjects in the pedia tric weight management program  
 
Study Protocol Hypothesis: 
 Intragastric balloon is a safe , well tolerated  and effective intervention for weight loss and 
decreasing obesity complications in adolescents with comorbidities.  
 
[ADDRESS_1093113] ([CONTACT_72117]) or a pediatric gastroenterologist ([CONTACT_792956]) who will review and approve the potential subject’s inclusion and exclusion criteria.  For interested subjects who have met all the inclusion and exclusion criteria, assent will be obtained from the subject and consent will be obtained from the 
parent/legal guardian.  After consent, the subject will be given three questionnaires to complete at home and return at the baseline visit; the PN Q will be returned to and reviewed by [CONTACT_792917]  (WMC) , and the CES-D and S CAS will be 
returned to and reviewed by [CONTACT_792918].    At baseline, s ubjects will be seen by [CONTACT_792919] a pediatric endocrinologist ([CONTACT_72117]) or a pediatric gastroenterologist  ([CONTACT_792957]) for a physical examination; a registered dietitian  in the WMC ; and a psychologist.  
Blood, urine, and stool samples will be collected at baseline.  Food record templates will be 
provided to study subjects to be completed for three days prior to each future WMC visit.

  Revised 07/11/[ADDRESS_1093114]’ s availability .  Female subjects 
will also have a urine pregnancy test  in the morning before the procedure.   
 
If the subject still meets all the inclusion and exclusion criteria after the baseline evaluations and the pregnancy test are completed, s/he will undergo physical examination followed by [CONTACT_792920] a gastroenterologist ([CONTACT_792956] or [CONTACT_792958]) via endoscopic approach under monitored and controlled anesthesia.  Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is very safe and routine diagnostic approach for adolescents  with gastrointestinal 
disorders.[ 25] The balloon will remain in the stomach if tolerated for [ADDRESS_1093115] ([CONTACT_792956] or [CONTACT_792958] ).  In 
order to prepare for the IGB removal, the subject will need to be on a liquid diet for [ADDRESS_1093116] f ollow up psychology visits  to support adherence and address any emotional 
and social adjustment concerns . Blood and urine  samples will also be collected at months 3, 6, 
9 and 12, after the IGB insertion .  The subjects  and their parents  will be contact[CONTACT_792921] a GI nurse  to answer telephone questionnaire  in between the visits on site at 4 days, 2 weeks, 
and at months 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 11, after the IGB insertion.    Blood Samples : Eight to twelve hour fasting blood samples will be collected at baseline, 3, 6, 
9, and 12 month visits including:  
• CBC with differential 
• Electrolytes panel  (Sodium, Potassium, Calcium , Creatinine, Chloride, Bicarbonate, 
BUN)  
• Liver function tests (AST, ALT , Alkaline phosphatase, Total Bilirubin, Total Protein, 
Albumin )  
• Nutritional assessment (Fe/TIBC, B12, Folic Acid, 25-Hydroxy Vitamin D, Ferritin) 
• Coagulation panel (ProTime/INR, PTT) 
• Total Cholesterol/Lipid panel 
• Thyroid function tests , PTH  
• Insulin  
• Glucose 
• CRP   
• HgA1c  
IGB in Obese Adolescents with Comorbidities   Version 1.5 
  Revised 07/11/[ADDRESS_1093117] of the IGB on the GI physiology will be assessed by [CONTACT_792922] 3, 6, 9 and 12 months: Total Ghrelin ; PYY; GLP -1; and Leptin .   
 In total, approximately 40  ml of blood will be drawn for all blood tests. 
 Urine Sample :  A urine sample will be collected at baseline, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months.   
 Stool Sample :  A stool sample will be collected for a fecal antigen study for H elicobacter 
pylori (H. pylori)  (sensitivity > 96.8%) to exclude the presence of H. pylori prior to the initial 
endoscopic assessment.    
3.2 Primary Study Endpoints  
 
The primary endpoint will be achieving ≥ 10% total body weight loss  (TBWL) .  
3.3 Secondary Study Endpoints  
 The s econdary endpoints will be: 
1. Evaluat ing the effect of the weight loss on the adolescents ’ overall health and mental 
health using the well-being questionnaires, CES -D and  SCAS, prior to IGB insertion, 
while the IGB is in place, and after the IGB removal . 
2. Assessing the effect of weight loss on obesity side effects by [CONTACT_792923], fasting insulin, HgA1c, and lipid profile.  
3.4 Primary Safety Endpoints 
 
• Incidence of all serious adverse events including unanticipated adverse effects  (balloon 
migration, small bowel obstruction, luminal GI perforation, ulcer formation, liver 
abscess formation, bleeding, biliary obstruction or injury, aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], infection, 
abdominal pain requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], nausea and dehydration requiring intravenous fluids, and death). All adverse events will be captured and graded for 
severity using
 Common Terminology Criteria  for Adverse Events (CTCAE) scale. 
[27]

5 Study Device  
5.1 Description  
 The Orbera  (Apollo Endosurgery, Austin, TX)  is an elastic spherical balloon made of silicone, 
filled with 550 mL of saline solution, and is FDA approved for weight loss in adult US patients 
with body mass index between 30 to 40 kg/m
2.  The deflated balloon comes preloaded on a 
catheter, which is blindly advanced trans -orally into the stomach. An endoscope is then  
advanced alongside it to ensure accurate placement of the balloon in the fundus. Under direct visualization, the balloon is then inflated by [CONTACT_792910]. The Orbera balloon is currently used in many countries outside the [LOCATION_002] and is typi[INVESTIGATOR_792895] 6 months and then retrieved endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_897].

 If there is a device malfunction during the initial endoscopic placement (e.g. balloon is 
deflated, perforated, or other failure), then the balloon will be replaced with a new balloon during the same procedure.  During the follow-up visits or phone calls, if there is concern that the balloon is malfunctioning or may be deflated after successful placement, which can be suggested by [CONTACT_792942], ability  to eat larger meals, or failure to lose weight during two consecutive 
follow-up visits, an abdominal ultrasound assessment will be performed.    
• If the balloon is intact, then no endoscopic assessment will be indicated.   
• If there is evidence of balloon malfunction without complication, a new balloon will 
be placed.   
• If the balloon is deflated in the stomach, it will be replaced endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_223456] a new

  Revised 07/11/[ADDRESS_1093151] (UADE) will be recorded on the appropriate case report form.  Records of these events will be maintained and reports submitted to the FDA and IRB according to the regulatory requirements.  All adverse events will be rep orted.  
Expected clinical adverse events and anticipated adverse device effects are those listed in Section 1.5.2. 
8.[ADDRESS_1093152] (UADE)  
A UADE is any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life-threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device if that effect, problem or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or IDE application (including a supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.  
 Adverse Effect (Event)  
Any untoward medical occurrence in a subject involved in clinical study of an investigational device; regardless of the causal relationship of the problem with the device or, if applicable, other study related treatment(s).  
 General Physical Examination Findings At screening, any clinically significant abnormality should be recorded as a preexisting condition.  At the end of the study, any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities that meet the definition of an adverse event must also be recorded and documented as an adverse event.  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], Prolonged Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14840].  Any condition responsible for surgery should be documented as an adverse event if the condition meets the criteria for an adverse event.  
 Neither the condition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], nor surgery are reported as an adverse event in the following circumstances:

Imad Absah, M.D.   CONFIDENTIAL  • Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5110] a preexisting condition.  Surgery should not  be reported as an outcome 
of an adverse event if the purpose of the surgery was elective or diagnostic and the 
outcome was uneventful. 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14842]. 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14843], unless it is a worsening or increase in frequency of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14844]. 
 Post-study Adverse Event  
All unresolved adverse events should be followed by [CONTACT_1374], the subject is lost to follow-up, or the adverse event is otherwise explained.  At the last scheduled visit, the local investigator should instruct each subject to report, to the local investigator, any subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the subject’s personal physician, believes might reasonably be related to participation in this study.  The local investigator should notify the study regulatory sponsor of any death or adverse event occurring at any time after a subject has discontinued or terminated study participation that may reasonably be related to th is study.  The sponsor should also be notified if the local investigator should 
become aware of the development of problems, cancer or of a congenital anomaly in a subsequently conceived offspring of a subject that has participated in this study.  Preexist ing Condition 
A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  A preexisting condition should be recorded as an adverse event if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the condition worsens during the study period.  Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk to Subjects or Others (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_14845])  
Any unanticipated problem or adverse event that meets all of the following three criteria:  
• Serious: Serious problems or events that results in significant harm, (which may be 
physical, psychological, financial, social, economic, or legal) or increased risk for the subject or others (including individuals who are not research subjects). These include: (1) death; (2) life threatening adverse experience; (3) hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] - inpatient, new, or prolonged; (4) disability/incapacity - persistent or significant; (5) birth defect/anomaly; (6) breach of confidentiality and (7) other problems, events, or new information (i.e. publications, DSMB reports, interim findings, product labeling change) that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_14846], safety, or welfare of the subjects or others, or substantially compromise the research data, AND  
• Unanticipated: (i.e. unexpected) problems or events are those that are not already 
described as potential risks in the protocol, consent document, not listed in the Investigator’s Brochure, or not part of an underlying disease. A problem or event is "unanticipated" when it was unforeseeable at the time of its occurrence. A problem or event is "unanticipated" when it occurs at an increased frequency or at an increased severity than expected, AND

procedures. 
 
Adverse Event Reporting Period  
 For this study, the study treatment follow-up period is defined from enrollment in the  study 
to 6 months after balloon removal (12 months from balloon insertion). Adverse events will be captured and reported from enrollment to the end of the study treatment follow-up.  
8.[ADDRESS_1093153] be recorded.  All observed or volunteered adverse effects (serious or non- serio us) and abnormal test findings, regardless of 
the treatment group if applicable or suspected causal relationship to the investigational device or if applicable other study treatment or diagnostic product(s) will be recorded in the subjects’ case history.  For all adverse effects  sufficient information will be pursued and or 
obtained as to permit; an adequate determination of the outcome, an assessment of the casual relationship between the adverse effect and the investigational device or, if applicable other study treatment or diagnostic product.  The clinical course of each event should be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been ultimately determined that the study treatment or participation is not the  probable cause.  Serious adverse events that are still 
ongoing at the end of the study period must be followed up, to determine the final outcome.  Any serious adverse event that occurs after the study period and is considered to be at least possibly related to the study treatment or study participation should be recorded and reported immediately.  
 Adverse events will be solicited at each study visit or contact [CONTACT_10974]. All adverse events will be recorded with the following information:   
• Subject Study Number/Identifier  
• Device information (model and serial number) 
• Date of event onset  
• Description of the event 
• Indication if study treatment was discontinued, or if investigational device was removed  
• Subject current status, or if the event was resolved 
• Princi pal Investigator assessment of if the event was serious and justification for 
determination

copi[INVESTIGATOR_514738] (i.e., Seeking Safety [SS]) in male and female Veterans with comorbid AD and PTSD. Hypotheses for the primary aim are:  
1. At post -treatment, both groups will show reductions in alcohol use, but COPE will demonstrate
greater reduction in PTSD symptoms than SS.2. At the 2nd and 3rd post treatment follow up assessment ,COPE will have significantly fewerpercent drinking days than SS.3. At the 2nd and 3rd post treatment follow up assessment ,COPE will continue to have lower PTSD
symptom scores.

females are in each treatment group.  
The Timeline Follow -back Procedure (TLFB50)  will be employed at baseline, post -treatment, 5 -
month, and 8- month follow up to evaluate drinking and all drug use during the 30 days preceding 
each interview.  
The Clinician -Administered PTSD Scale for DSM -V(CAPS54,55)  is a standard semi -structured

Key Information About This Study   
 
The following is a short summary of this study to help you decide whether or not to participate.  More 
detailed information follows later in th is form.  
 
The purpose of this study is to  evaluate the causes of  and treatment for feeding difficult y in infants with 
Gastro -esophageal Reflux Disease (GERD).  You are being asked to enroll your child in this study 
because they had a Reflux index higher th an 3 on a pH/impedance test.  
 
Study participation:  
If you decide to enroll your child in this study, they will undergo a n esophageal manometry test to see 
how well the muscles of the throat, food pi[INVESTIGATOR_77684]. Then your child will be 
randomized into one of two groups. The difference between the two groups will be in feeding volumes 
and positons. Both groups will receive medication for Gastroesophageal Reflux. They will receive the 
medication for [ADDRESS_84596] another 
pH/impedance test.  
 
Study visits:  
The first pH /impedance testing and manometry will take place while your child is in the NICU.  
The second pH/impedance study will take place 5 weeks later. If your child has b een discharged, you 
will be asked to bring them back to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_77685].  
If your child has been discharged, you may be asked to keep a diary for us until the 2nd study is 
scheduled  
See a more detailed discussion later in this form.  
 
The main risk(s) of the study comes from having the manometry catheter and pH/impedance catheters. 
These are same as when any tube is placed through the nose and can include redness, irritation and 
minor bleeding. There are no known risks of using the medicat ion for GERD.

The benefit(s) of the study are your child will receive evaluation and close observation related to GERD, 
feeding  and breathing problems.  Information known from other studies may be of benefit to your chi ld.   
Your participation may ad d to medical knowledge about infants who are at risk of feeding difficulty due 
to GERD and airway disease.

1) INTRODUCTION  
We invite you to be in this research study .  Using this form as a guide, we will explain the study to 
you. If you have any questions about the study, please ask. By [CONTACT_3368], you agree to be in 
this study. If you do not want to be in this study, all regular and standard medical care will still be 
available to you here at Nationwide Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Participation is voluntary.  You can leave 
this study at any time.  
 
You will be given a signed and dated copy of the consent and the assent forms.  
 
2) WHERE WILL THE STUDY BE DONE AND HOW MA NY SUBJECTS WILL TAKE PART?   
 
This study will be done at Nationwide Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_77686] 120 participants .  
 
 
 
3)   WHAT WILL HAPPEN DURING THE STUDY  AND HOW LONG WILL IT LAST ? 
 If you  decide to enroll your child in this study,  we will  start by [CONTACT_7087] a manometry study. A manometry 
study is test to see how well the muscles of the food pi[INVESTIGATOR_5836] (esophagus) work together. A special 
feeding tube called a ma nometry tube is passed through  your child’s nose into the food pi[INVESTIGATOR_5836] . This 
tube is similar  to the tube used for feeding babies in the NICU.  This  tube is then connected to a 
machine that measures the movement of t he muscles of the food pi[INVESTIGATOR_5836].   
 
Once the manometry tube is placed, we will test how well your baby [CONTACT_77698]. To do this we, will put 
6-8 teaspoons of room air and 3-4 teaspoons of  sterile water through the manometry tube and into the 
middle of your baby’s food pi[INVESTIGATOR_5836].  We will start with small amount so of each of those things and work 
our way up to larger amounts.  Then, we will put [ADDRESS_84597] your baby’s suck -swallow coordination, 
we will be using a device called an N -trainer. The N -trainer uses a pacifier on a receiver to create 
waveforms visible on a screen that can be used to evaluate a baby’s suck -swallow pattern. Another 
way we will evaluate your baby’s suck -swallow pattern is by [CONTACT_77699] a pacifier and a nipple. These sensors are small and your baby [CONTACT_77700]. Finally, we will feed your baby [CONTACT_77701] a bottle.    
To tell when a swallow beg ins, the activity of the muscles of the n eck will be recorded with the help of 
sticky leads (like chest leads) placed on the chin. To watch facial movements and behaviors  during

2.1 Background and Rationale
Why Is This Study Being Conducted?
AGN -[ADDRESS_1016757] being developed for the treatment of glabellar lines (GL).  
Facial lines that develop from repeated facial expression, such as GL, are typi[INVESTIGATOR_743594].1-[ADDRESS_1016758] botulinum neurotoxin serotypes (A, B, C1, D, E, F, G, and H) that are 
similar in structure and action and produced by [CONTACT_743601] .  Botulinum Neurotoxin Serotype A (BoNT/A) is popular as a c osmetic treatment of GL in 
adults due to its proven efficacy for reducing moderate to severe facial lines,6well documented safety 
profile,7and positive impact on psychological well -being and the resulting psychosocial b enefits.8  
Botulinum Neurotoxin Serotype E is the active ingredient of AGN -151586.  The rationale for the use of 
AGN -151586 to treat GL is the same as that for BoNT/A in that by [CONTACT_743602],9,10the overactivity of the 
muscles responsible for these lines can be reduced, thus eliminating or diminishing the appearanc e of 
GL.  AGN -151586 offers the potential for faster onset of efficacy compared with the BoNT/A products.9  
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of AGN -151586 for the treatment of GL in 
subjects with moderate to severe GL.
2.2 Benefits and Risks to Subjects
Allergan (an [COMPANY_013] company) completed 1 dose ranging study (Study 2034 -201-008) to explore the 
safety and efficacy of single cycle treatments at doses ranging from  AGN -151586 -specific 
units for the treatment of GL in adults.  Unit s of biological activity of AGN -151586 cannot be converted 
to those of other neurotoxin products.
In this Phase 2b Study, a clinical dose response was observed, demonstrating that the proportion of 
responders (i.e., subjects having ≥ 2-grade improvement from baseline as assessed by [CONTACT_743603] 7) increased with increasing AGN -151586 dose.  The responder rate was approximately 
95% for the cohort dosed with   The overall incidence of study drug -related treatment -emergent 
adverse event (TEAE s) was similar between the placebo group (18.0%) compared with the AGN -151586 
group (20.9%).  There were no safety trends or patterns identified with increasing dose of AGN -151586.  
Overall, AGN -[ADDRESS_1016759] benefit and 
thus,  was selected for Phase 3 pi[INVESTIGATOR_36491]. 
Based on the Phase 2b Study results, there are no known adverse drug reactions (ADRs) for 
AGN -151586 .  Since AGN -151586 is given as an intramuscular injection, injection site re actions 
(e.g., pain, bruising, swelling, etc.) are anticipated.  In addition, the mechanism of action of AGN -151586 
is similar to BOTOX and thus, adverse reactions associated with BOTOX, when injected into the glabellar

and muscular weakness.
The overall benefit:risk profile is anticipated to be favorable.
For further details, please see findings from completed studies, including safety data in the current 
AGN -151586 Investigator's Brochure.
Considering the coronavirus disease –2019 ( COVID -19) pandemic ,and based on the information to 
date , no additional risk to study participants is anticipated with the use of AGN -151586.  While [COMPANY_013] 
does not consider COVID -19 to be a safety concern for AGN -151586 or BOTOX due to their mechanism 
of action and route of administration, the marketing authorization holder is monitoring COVID -19 events 
during the pandemic closely. A recent review of COVID -19 events fo r the period of 01 January 2019 
through 31 December 2021 did not identify any new or significant safety findings for the patients 
receiving BOTOX treatment with onabotulinumtoxinA -branded products (BOTOX, BOTOX Cosmetic, 
VISTABEL ®, VISTABEX ®, and BOTOX Vis ta 50 ®) or botulinum toxin type A products (in which the 
manufacturer was not identified).   Overall, the clinical course and presentation of patients with 
COVID -[ADDRESS_1016760] a similar mechanism of action.

4.1 Overall Study Design and Plan
This is a 12 -week, multicenter, Phase 3 study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 
AGN -151586 in treating GL.  Subjects are adults ( ≥ 18 years of age) with moderate to severe GL at 
maximum frown as assessed independently by [CONTACT_743604].  The
investigator and subject ratings for GL will be done at the Screening Visit and at the Baseline Day [ADDRESS_1016771] may receive up to 2 study treatments with 
AGN -151586. The time of study treatment administration defines H our 0 forthe treatment period ( on 
Day 1 for double -blind period and on Day 43 for open- label period ). 
Eligible subjects will be enrolled into the study containing 2 treatment periods: 
Double -blind Period: 
Screening will occur up to [ADDRESS_1016772] been completed.  A single treatment of 
AGN -151586  or placebo will be administered on Baseline Day 1, based on randomization (3:1 ratio 
of AGN -151586:placebo).  Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_274311] , toxin use history ( for 
aesthetic purpose ), and baseline GL severity at maximum frown.  All enrolled subjects will receive 
treatment on Baseline Day [ADDRESS_1016773].
The double -blind period will end on Day 43.  The Day 43 visit will occur 42 ±2 days following the Day 1 
visit.  The study assessm ents conducted during the Day 43 visit serve as the final assessment for the 
double -blind period and as the baseline assessment for the open -label period. 
Open- label Period: 
For subjects meeting all the retreatment criteria on Day 43, a single open -label treatment with

Selection of Doses in the Study
In the previous Phase 2b Study 2034 -201-008, a clinical dose response was observed, demonstrating 
that the proportion of responders (i.e., subjects having ≥ 2-grade improvement from baseline as 
assessed by [CONTACT_743606] 7) increased with increasing AGN -151586 dose.  The responder 
rate was approximately 95% for the cohort dosed with . The overall incidence of study drug -
related TEAEs was similar between the placebo group (18.0%) compared with the AGN -151586 group 
(20.9%).  There were no safety trends or patterns identified with increasing the dose of AGN -151586.  
Overall, AG N-[ADDRESS_1016780] meet all of the following criteria in order to be included in the study.  Anything other than a positive response to the questions below will result in exclusion from study participation.  Subjects who do not mee t the eligibility criteria for participation in this study (screen failures) may be allowed to 
be rescreened.  Rescreening of subjects must only occur after discussion with the sponsor.  Rescreening can only occur once for any given potential subject; howe ver, if the original screen failure was due to 
ineligible FWS grade(s), the subject will not be permitted to rescreen.

At the Screening Visit, all su bjects will be assigned a unique identification number using the IRT.  For 
subjects who rescreen, the screening number assigned by [CONTACT_221004].  The IRT will assign a randomization number that will encode the subje ct's treatment group 
assignment according to the randomization schedule (3:1 ratio AGN -151586:placebo ).
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_274311] , toxin use history (for aesthetic purpose), and 
baseline GL severity at maximum frown.   
 
  To support this, the site will manually enter the subject's Baseline Day 1 FWS score (moderate or 
severe; per eligibility criteria, the investigator and subject FWS assessments must be identical) , toxin use 
history (for aesthetic purpose ),and the Baseline Day 1 FLO -11 total score (as calculated by [CONTACT_743613] [EDC] after the subject completes the questionnaire) in to the IRT.  
All [COMPANY_013] personnel with direct oversight of the conduct and management of the trial (with the

No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].All follow -up information is to be reported to the sponsor (or an authorized representative) and 
documented in source as required by [CONTACT_456].  Product complaints associated with AEs will be 
reported in the study su mmary.  All other complaints will be monitored on an ongoing basis.  Product 
complaints occurring during the study will be followed up to a satisfactory conclusion.
Medical Complaints/Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events
An AE is defined as any untowa rd medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with 
this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding or vital sign measurement), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use 
of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not the event is considered causally related to the 
use of the product.
Such an event ca n result from use of the drug as stipulated in the protocol or labeling, as well as from 
"special situations" such as accidental or intentional overdose, medication error, occupational or 
accidental exposure, off -label use, drug abuse, drug misuse, or drug withdrawal, all which must be 
reported whether associated with an AE or not.  Any worsening of a pre -existing condition or illness is 
considered an AE.  Worsening in severity of a reported AE should be reported as a new AE.  Laboratory 
abnormalities and c hanges in vital signs are considered to be AEs only if they result in discontinuation 
from the study, necessitate therapeutic medical intervention, and/or if the investigator considers them 
to be AEs.
The investigators will monitor each subject for clinica l and laboratory evidence of AEs on a routine basis 
throughout the study.  All AEs will be followed to a satisfactory conclusion.
An elective surgery/procedure scheduled to occur during a study will not be considered an AE if the 
surgery/procedure is being performed for a pre -existing condition and/or the surgery/procedure has 
been pre -planned prior to study entry.  However, if the pre -existing condition deteriorates unexpectedly 
during the study (e.g., surgery performed earlier than planned), then the dete rioration of the condition 
for which the elective surgery/procedure is being done will be considered an AE.
If an AE, whether associated with study drug or not, meets any of the following criteria, it is to be 
reported to [COMPANY_013] clinical pharmacovigilance as a serious adverse event (SAE) immediately without 
undue delay, but no later than 24 hours , from when the site ismade aware of the SAE (refer to 
Section 4.[ADDRESS_1016797] information):
Death of Subject An event that results in the death of a subject.
Life-Threatening An event that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], would have 
resulted in immediate fatality if medical intervention had not been 
taken.  This does not include an event that would have been fatal if it 
had occurred in a more severe form.

Persistent or Significant 
Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that substantially interferes with 
the activities of daily living of a study subject.  Disability is not 
intended to inclu de experiences of relatively minor medical 
significance such as headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, 
and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle).
Important Medical Event 
Requiring Medical or Surgical 
Intervention to Prevent 
Serious OutcomeAnimportant medical event that may not be immediately life -
threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but based on 
medical judgment may jeopardize the subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes 
listed abo ve (i.e., death of subject, life -threatening, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], congenital anomaly, or persistent or 
significant disability/incapacity).  Additionally, any elective or 
spontaneous abortion or stillbirth is considered an impo rtant 
medical event. 
All AEs reported from the time of study drug administration will be collected for at least [ADDRESS_1016798] signs the study -specific informed consent.
The following definitions will be used for Serious Adverse Reactions (SAR) and Suspected Unexpected 
Serious Adverse Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R):
SAR Defined as all noxious and unintended responses to an Investigational Medicinal 
Product (IMP) related to any dose administered that result in an SAE as defined 
above.
S[LOCATION_003]R Refers to individual SAE case reports from clini cal trials where a causal 
relationship between the SAE and the IMP was suspected by [CONTACT_17189], is unexpected (not listed in the applicable Reference Safety 
Information), and meets one of the above serious criteria.
[COMPANY_013] wil l be responsible for S[LOCATION_003]R reporting for the investigational medicinal product (IMP) in 
accordance with global and local requirements.
Adverse events will be monitored throughout the study to identify any of special interest that may 
indicate a trend or ri sk to subjects.
Adverse Events of Special Interest

The investigators will rate the severity of each AE as mild, moderate, or severe.
The investigator will use the following definitions to rate the severity of each AE:
Mild The AE is transient and easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423].
Moderate The AE causes the subject discomfort and interrupts the subject's usual 
activities.
Severe The AE causes considerable interference with the subject's usual activities 
and may be incapacitating or life -threatening.
The investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the AE to the use of study 
drug and to the injection procedure:
Reasonable 
PossibilityAfter consideration of factors including timing of the event, biologic 
plausibility, clinical judgment, and potential alternative causes, there is 
sufficient evidence (information) to suggest a causal relationship.
No Reasonable 
PossibilityAfter consideration of factors including timing of the event, biologic 
plausibility, clinical judgment, and potential alternative causes, there is 
insufficient evidence (information) to suggest a causal relationship.
Pregnancy
While not an AE, pregnancy in a study subject must be reported to [COMPANY_013] within [ADDRESS_1016799] be reported to [COMPANY_013] immediately without undue delay, but no later than 
24 hours ,from when the site is made aware of the event.

7.2 Definition for Analysis Populations
The following population sets will be used for the analyses.
The ITT Population includes all randomiz ed subjects.  For double -blind period analyses, subjects will be 
included in the analysis according to the treatment groups to which they were randomized.  For open -
label period analyses, data will be analyzed according to the treatments randomized in the double -blind 
period and received in the open -label period (i.e., AGN -151586/AGN -151586, AGN -151586/None, 
Placebo/AGN -151586, Placebo/None).
Baseline analyses and efficacy analyses for US FDA and EU Regulatory agencies will be performed on the 
ITT populatio n, consisting of all randomized subjects.  Subjects will be included in the double -blind 
period analysis according to the treatment groups to which they were randomized.  For open -label 
period analyses, data will be analyzed according to the treatments ran domized in the double -blind 
period and received in the open -label period (i.e., AGN -151586/AGN -151586, AGN -151586/None, 
Placebo/AGN -151586, Placebo/None).
Additionally, for EU regulatory agencies only, subgroup analyses will be performed on the ITT 
populat ion, that also has a baseline FLO -11 total score ≤ 50.  Analyses will consist of the EU primary and 
key secondary endpoints.
The Safety Analysis Set consists of all subjects who were treated with at least 1 dose of study drug (i.e., 
AGN -151586 or placebo).   All safety analyses will be performed with subjects analyzed by [CONTACT_743614] -blind period/open- label period (i.e., AGN -151586/AGN -151586, 
AGN -151586/None, Placebo/AGN -151586, Placebo/None), and will be presented with overall safety 
data for the study (i.e., either period), for double -blind period, and for open -label period.  The Safety 
Analysis Set will be used for all safety analyses.

Secondary Endpoints
The prima ry efficacy endpoint of the composite endpoints for the US FDA and the coprimary endpoints 
for the EU regulatory agencies (defined in Section 3.2), respectively, will be analyzed based on the ITT 
population and the following methods will be used to address potential intercurrent events:
Subjects who did not receive any dose of study drug but are randomized will still be included in 
the ITT populati on.  For the EU, those who also had baseline FLO -11 total score of ≤ 50 will be 
included in subgroup analyses of the coprimary and key secondary endpoints.
Subjects who are randomized but prematurely discontinued the study before assessment of the 
primary endpoints will be considered as part of the ITT population.
Subjects who die before assessment of the primary endpoints will count as though they 
hypothetically continued in the study.
Subjects who are lost to follow -up and are missing data for the primary endpoints will count as 
though they hypothetically continued in the study.
Subjects who are missing assessments or data due to the COVID -19 pandemic and are missing 
data for the primary endpoints will count as though they hypothetically continued in the s tudy.
Subjects who are missing data for any other reason for the primary endpoints will count as 
though they hypothetically continued in the study.
The efficacy analysis of secondary endpoints (defined in Section 3.3) will be analyzed based on the same 
populations as above with similar methods for addressing potential intercurrent events.
7.4 Statistical Analyses for Efficacy
Demographics, baseline or di sease characteristics, medical history, and prior and concomitant 
medications will be summarized for the ITT population.  Medical history data will be reported and 
summarized separately from prior procedures data for the ITT population. Medical history da ta and 
prior procedure data will be coded using the MedDRA .  Prior and concurrent procedures will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_743615].
Summary and Analysis of the Primary Endpoints
Analysis of the respective primary endpoints will be conducted o n the ITT Population for the US and for 
the EU regulatory agencies based on treatment as randomized.

European Union regulatory agencies:  The coprimary responder endpoints for ≥ 2-grade improvement 
from baseline in the FWS will be analyzed separately usin g the CMH method  
.  Both 
coprimary endpoints must meet p≤ 0.[ADDRESS_1016802] stratified by [CONTACT_274311] , toxin use history, and baseline FWS .  (Sites may 
be pooled for stratification purposes if there are too few subjects in a site.) A p -value ≤0.05 (2 -sided 
testing) will be claimed as statistically significant.   
 
For primary and secondary endpoints, missing data will first be imput ed at the visit level using multiple 
imputation, and then the responder definitions will be applied.  Details are provided in the SAP for 
missing data handling.
Sensitivity analyses of the primary efficacy variables will be performed to establish their consistency and 
robustness as well as to further characterize the extent of subjects' responses. As-observed data 
analysis, as well as missing as non- responder (using non-responder imputation [NRI]) analysis, stratified 
by [CONTACT_743616].

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].7.5 Statistical Analyses for Safety
The safety analyses will be performed using the safety population (i.e., Safety Analysis Set) .  The safety 
parameters will include AEs , vital sign measurements, 12 -lead ECG, laboratory evaluations (hematology 
and chemistry), neurological assessment (examination to consist of assessment of cranial nerves II 
through VII), physical examination, and immunogenicity.  The last nonmissing safet y assessment before 
study drug administration will be used as the baseline for all analyses of that endpoint.
Treatment -emergent AEs are defined as any AE with the onset that is after the first dose of study drug.  
Events where the onset date is the same a s the study drug start date are assumed to be treatment -
emergent, unless known to have started prior to study treatment administration. 
An overview of AEs will be presented consisting of the number and percentage of subjects experiencing 
at least one even t for each of the following AE categories:
1.Any TEAE
2.Any TEAE related to study treatment according to the investigator (i.e., study drug -related, study 
injection procedure -related)
3.Any severe TEAE
a.Any severe TEAE related to study treatment according to the investigator
4.Any serious TEAE
a.Any serious TEAE related to study treatment according to the investigator
5.Any TEAE leading to discontinuation of study drug
6.Any TEAE leading to death
7.PDSOT TEAEs
8.Neurological assessment TEAEs
9.All deaths

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].Treatment -emergent AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_9313] (SOC) and PT; by [CONTACT_743617] (i.e., study drug related, study injection procedure related) as assessed 
by [CONTACT_093] (e.g., reasonable possibility or no reaso nable possibility) and SOC and PT; by 
[CONTACT_17192]; and by [CONTACT_743618].  Specific treatment -
emergent AEs will be counted once for each subject for calculating percentages, unless stated 
otherwise.  In addition, if the s ame AE occurs multiple times within a subject, the AE will be counted 
only once, and the highest severity and level of relationship to investigational product will be reported.
Serious AEs (including deaths) and AEs leading to study drug discontinuation wi ll be summarized by [CONTACT_743619].
Possible distant spread of toxin PTs will be identified in the SAP and PDSOT TEAEs will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_6214]. 
Neurological assessment TEAEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_6214].
Vital sign measurements and 12 -lead ECG parameters will be summarized for each assessment 
timepoint, as well as for changes from baseline at each assessment timepoint.  In addition, potentially 
clinically significant vital signs values will be summarized.  Details will be provided in the SAP .
Immunogenicity results, manifested as the presence of binding antibodies (positive) and neutralizing 
antibodies (positive) to AGN -151586, will be summarized in a table for baseline and postbaseline data.  
Immunogenicity findings (positive) will be tabula ted with the number and percentage of subjects at each 
visit.  Percentages will be based on the number of treated subjects with interpretable antibody assays at 
the specified visit.  Immunogenicity results including additional analysis of antibody response to other 
neurotoxin serotypes will be documented in the CSR or in a separate report.
7.6 Overall Type I Error Control
For the double -blind period, to control the family -wise Type I error rate at 0.05 for multiplicity across 
the primary and secondary analyses, a hierarchical testing strategy11will be used.  The hierarchical 
testing strategy starts with the coprimary endpoint followed by [CONTACT_743620].  The statistical significance will be evaluated in the following order: if a statistical significance 
at the 0.05 level (2 -sided) is shown for the first endpoint in the ranking order, then the next endpoint in 
the immediate subsequent order will be evaluated; evaluation of subsequent endpoint will continue in 
the same manner.  If no statistical significance is shown at α = 0.05 at any endpoint, then the endpoint 
and all subsequent endpoints will not be considered statistically significant, regardless of their nominal 
p-values.
The hierarchical testing order follows for US FDA:
1.Primary: At least a 2 -grade improvement from baseline based on the following:
Investigator and subject assessments (composite) of GL severity at maximum frown at 
Day 7.
2.Secondary: Mostly satisfied or Very satisfied on the FLSQ follow -up version Item 5 (overall 
satisfaction) for GL at Day 7

For the US FDA, the following secondary endpoints will be evaluated outside of the gated hierarchical 
testing sequence at each time point :
1.Key Secondary: At least 2 -grade improvement from baseline in GL severity at maximum frown 
according to the investigator assessment using the FWS over time (double -blind period)
2.Key Seconda ry: At least [ADDRESS_1016804] assessment using the FWS over time (double -blind period).
The hierarchical testing order follows for EU regulatory agencies:
1.Coprimary: At least a 2 -grade improvement based on the following:
Subject assessment using FWS at maximum frown at Day 7, and 
Investigator assessment using FWS at maximum frown at Day 7.
2.Key Secondary: At least 20 -point improvement from baseline in FLO -11 total scores for GL at 
Day 7
3.Secondary: At least [ADDRESS_1016805] assessment using the FWS at Hour 24
4.Secondary: At least 2 -grade improvement from baseline in GL severity at maximum frown 
according to the investigator assessment using the FWS at Hour 24
5.Secondary: At least [ADDRESS_1016806] assessment using the FWS at Hour 24
6.Secondary: At least 1 -grade improvement from baseline in GL severity at maximum frown 
according to the investigator assessment using the FWS at Hour 24

satisfaction) for GL at Hour 24
8.Secondary: Mostly satisfied or Very satisfied on the FLSQ follow -up version Item 4 (natural look) 
for GL at Day 7 
9.Secondary: Mostly satisfied or Very satisfied on the FLSQ follow -up version Item 5 (overall 
satisfaction) over time 
10.Seco ndary: At least 4 -point improvement from baseline in FLO -11 Item 10 (look angry) for GL at 
Day 7

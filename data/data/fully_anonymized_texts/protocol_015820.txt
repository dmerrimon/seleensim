 1. Protocol Summary  
1.1 Rationale  
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is an established independent  risk factor for atheroscle rotic 
cardiovascular disease ( CVD) and is responsible for nearly 2.[ADDRESS_433246] important  adverse outcomes for patients with T2DM are cardiovascular, including 
cardiovascular death.   Now, there are a variety of evidence -based treatments to reduce 
cardiovascular  risk for patients with T2DM .  These include treatment of ris k factors like 
hypertension and hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035] , avoiding smoking, diet and exercise, and use of anti-
hyperglycemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_348749] .  Sodium -glucose 
cotransporter -2 (SGLT2)  inhibitor s and Glucagon -like peptide 1 (GLP -1) receptor agonist s have 
recently  been shown to be protective for patients with T2DM and  cardiovascular disease  or CVD 
risk.1, 2 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_348750] t herapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], they are used in a minority of patients who would benefit.   
Possible barriers to uptake include lack of “ownership” over prescribing these medications 
(primary care provider vs endocrinologist /diabetes care specialist  vs cardiologist), lack of 
familiarity and comfort with prescribing these medications, lack of a system to measure and 
provide feedback on performance, and lack of a comprehensive clinical pathway to provide 
multi -disciplinary evidence -based care to patien ts with T2DM and CVD.[ADDRESS_433247] (EHR) sites. A subset of sites with 
EHR data available for querying in existing datamarts will be recruited to participate in two 
EHR -focused objectives: 1) to perform a baseline characterization of patients with T2DM and 
CVD, inc luding demographics, treatment patterns and healthcare utilization such as 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; and 2) to assist with the identification of patients eligible for the educational 
intervention trial.  
What follows is the protocol for the COORDINATE trial; the obj ectives and planned analyses of 
data from EHR sites is summarized in section [ADDRESS_433248] a diagnosis of T2DM 
and cardiovascular disease as listed in the Inclusion Criteria .  
Patient Inclusion Criteria : 
1. Age ≥ 18 years old  
2. Diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) as reported in the patient’s 
medical records.   
3. History of at least one of the following conditions:  
a. Coronary artery disease (defined as prior MI, coronary 
revascularization  (CABG or PCI), and/or obstructive CAD (≥50%) as 
documented by [CONTACT_348756] ) 
b. Stroke  and/or carotid artery stenosis (≥50%)  
c. Peripheral Arterial disease (defined as claudication  with ABI<0.9 , 
prior peripheral revascularization, and/or  amputation due to  
circulatory insufficiency ) 
4. Baseline  composite score of guideline recommended therapy of <3 at baseline 
entry into the trial. Patients would receive a score of 1 for each of the 
following care elements:  
 ACE i/ARB  therapy  
 High-intensity statin  
 Most recent HbA1c<7% on metformin monotherapy  
5. Ability to communicate with site staff and understand and provide  written 
informed consent and proof of Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act (HIPAA) authorization  
Patient Exclusion Criteri on: 
1. Determined to be highly unlikely to survive  and/or to continue follow -up in 
that clinic  for at least 1 year , as identified by [CONTACT_88567]   
2. GFR<30 mL/min/1.73m2 
3. Baseline composite score of 3 for guideline recommended therapy  (as 
outlined in Patient Inclusion Criterion #4)  
4. Absolute contraindication  to any of the 3 guideline recommended therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] 
(as outlined in Patient Inclusion Criterion #4)  
5. Already taking SGLT2i or GLP1RA therapy at baseline.  
Site Inclusion Criteria:  
1. Cardiol ogy clinic that is willing and able to perform the interventions in the 
trial to improv e the quality of care of their patients with T2DM and CVD . 
2. Have a cardiologist and endocrinologist  or diabetes care specialist (for 
example, a PCP with experience in tre ating diabetes) who are willing to 
partner for the trial needs of creating and implementing care pathways  with 
the support of the COORDINATE Diabetes Study Team ; any site that has a 
highly organized partnership with cardiology -endocrinology with care 
pathw ays already established will not be included.   
CONFIDENTIAL   V [ADDRESS_433249] (EHR)  system that will enable  
identification and follow -up of patients . 
Study Design  The design is a cluster -randomized clinical implementation trial of a minimum of 
[ADDRESS_433250] follow -
up visit . 
Treatment 
Regimen(s)  Participants will receive care  at their physicians’ discretion.  
 The patients receiving care in clinics that are randomized to the intens ive 
educational intervention arm will be cared for by [CONTACT_348757] a multifaceted implementation program will be conducted to 
improve the use of guideline -recommended  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_348751] 
T2DM and CV disease .  
 The patients receiving care in clinics that are  randomi zed to the basic 
education arm will be treated by [CONTACT_348758] -based therapy.  
Duration of Study 
Participation  Data collection will continue for all participant s for [ADDRESS_433251] follow -up visit . 
Minimum Number 
of clusters ( Sites ) 
Required  42  
Average  cluster size  25 patients (yielding a total of 1050 patients)  
Total Sample Size  Approximately 1050 patients*  
* Need to maintain an overall average of [ADDRESS_433252] for all of the following (composite 
score of 3):  
 
1. Use of a regimen which includes an anti -
hyperglycemic agent indicated and/or 
guideline  recommended  to reduce 
cardiovascular risk * 
a. Acceptabl e alternative: metformin 
monotherapy with HbA1c<7%  
2. Guideline -recommended medical therapy * 
with ACEi/ARB  
3. Guideline -recommended medical therapy * 
with high -intensity statin: atorvastatin 40 -
80mg daily OR rosuvastatin 20 -40mg daily  
 
*As new consensus or evidence emerges and 
guidelines are updated, the composite score and 
requisites will be evaluated by [CONTACT_348759] . For the first component of the primary 
outcome (related to anti -hypergl ycemic agents), 
patients will be evaluated according to the list of 
“indicated and/or guideline recommended” agents  
in effect at the time of their last follow -up visit . 
This decision was approved by [CONTACT_131458] . Medications started during the st udy 
follow -up period that receive FDA 
indication/guideline recommendation during that 
time will count towards the primary outcome.  
 
It is important to note that the FDA indications 
and guideline recommendations will only become 
more liberal with time, not more restrictive.  Of 
note, patients who are  on any GLP1 -RA or 
SGLT2i therapy  at baseline will not be eligible for 
enrollment . 
Secondary  Objectives   
 
 All of the following secondary outcomes will be 
assessed at  the last follow -up visit . 
CONFIDENTIAL   V [ADDRESS_433253] -initiated 
medications for diabetes suggested by [CONTACT_348760]:  
 Proportion of patients achieving guideline -
recommended therapy for T2DM  
 Proportion of patients with an ACEi/ARB 
treatment  
 Proportion of patient with a high -intensity 
statin treatment  
 Variations on the Primary  Outcome : 
 Proportion of patients achieving a 
composite  score of ≥ 2  
 Intermediate Outcomes : 
 Changes from baseline to the last 
follow -up visit  in the following: sBP, 
dBP, HbA1c, LDL -C 
 Change from baseline to the last 
follow -up visit  in proportion of 
patients achieving the following 
targets (individually and in 
combination): sBP<130 mmHg, 
dBP<80 m mHg, HbA1c< 7%, LDL -
C<70 mg/dL  
 Clinical time-to-event outcomes ( While the 
primary outcome  will be measured as of the 
last follow -up visit , data on clinical outcomes 
will be collected throughout the follow -up 
period  for each patient ): 
 Composite of all -cause death; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272]: MI, stroke, 
decompensated heart failure, or urgent 
revascularization (coronary, 
peripheral, carotid)  
 Each of the clinical time -to-event 
outcomes will also be assessed 
individually  
Exploratory Objectives   
 The following may be assessed at up to  [ADDRESS_433254] provided social security number 
information : 
- all-cause mortality, as assessed by [CONTACT_348761] -level implementation outcomes:  
 Acceptability  
 Appropriateness  
CONFIDENTIAL   V [ADDRESS_433255]. Enrolled clinics will be 
randomized in a ratio of  1:[ADDRESS_433256] T2DM, CVD, 
and a baseline composite score <  3 at study entry. The study will be open -label, and 
randomization  of clinics will be stratified according to clinic -level factors, including:  
 Site location : Urban or non -urban  
Randomization of clinics will occur after each clinic has been screened and deemed eligible — 
willing to participate in the trial and has IRB app roval .  
3. Disclosure Statement  
This is a multifaceted implementation trial randomized at the clinic level  to [ADDRESS_433257] of care  (SOC) . Sites will be 
compensated for their involvement including for patient recruitment and assessments. They will 
also receive basic education  at study start  to include  the most updated ACC/AHA guidelines for 
cholesterol management and from the ADA about diabetes management  as well as periodic 
educational updates .2, 5, 6 They will also receive clinic -level education relat ed to drug safety, 
including statin side effects and potential side effects of anti -diabetes medications with CV 
benefit (such as hypoglycemia, DKA, etc.). Beyond this basic information, sites (and physicians) 
in the basic education arm will not receive ot her instructions or intensive  educational  
interventions. They will be left to care for their patients as they normally would. Patients in the 
basic education arm will be seen by [CONTACT_348762] , either in clinic or via 
virtual visit, per local standard of care . Follow -up visits (i.e., standard of care in-person or virtual 
visit, or telephone call) will be conducted by [CONTACT_348763] [ADDRESS_433258] follow -up visit determined by  [CONTACT_102]’s enrollment 
date. Data collected will be entered in to an electronic data capture system.  Clinic v isits should be 
conducted as per standard of care . 
CONFIDENTIAL   V [ADDRESS_433259] /diabetes care specialist  co-PIs at each site will oversee this 
development.  Prior to study start, a Manual of Operation s will be developed by [CONTACT_348764]. This manual will be available for dissemination 
after trial completion. It will build on professional society guidelines  (such as ADA, ACC, as 
described in the primary endpoint)  and will consist of evidence -based standards of care that 
should be included in the clinical pathway implemented at each site. Though these standards may 
be adapted to meet the needs of each individual site, the core components of the care pathwa y 
will be consistent across intensive educational intervention sites. Throughout the intervention, 
the care teams will be encouraged to communicate with the primary care physicians of individual 
patients to facilitate a team approach to patient care. Thoug h the intensive  educational  
intervention will not be specifically targeted towards primary care physicians, they are an 
integral part of optimal patient care and will be kept engaged throughout.  
The intensive educational intervention will consist of  the following : 
 Each clinic is assigned a mentor pair of specialists from the COORDINATE -Diabetes 
National Academy Faculty (a cardiologist and endocrinologist /diabetes care specialist ) and a 
DCRI quality improvement (QI) specialist  (the “COORDINATE -Diabete s Trio”)  
 Each site’s clinic leadership pair and research coordinators will attend a n implementation 
training session  virtually conducted by [CONTACT_348765] -Diabetes Trio . 
 This COORDINA TE-Diabetes T rio will conduct a health system and clinic site visit prior  to 
implementation training. This visit may be conducted on -site or virtually.  During the visit, 
the Trio will : 
o Conduct a health system -wide grand rounds education program (if possible) on 
identification and care of the cardiovascular  diabetic population , and 
o Meet with the clinic  leadership pair (cardiologist and endocrinologist /diabetes care 
specialist ) and the research coordinator.  The clinical leadership pair, research 
coordinator, patient advocate, and study staff (for prior authorizations and patient 
education) will constitute the core study team at each clinic site , and  
o Respond to the clinic’s current practice, care processes, and available outcomes data 
from the site survey, and help the clinic team develop a GAP  analysis.  This GAP 
analysis will be s pecific to each site. Each site  will formally submit this GAP analysis 
within [ADDRESS_433260] Lead . 
 The COORDINATE -Diabetes Trio assigned to each clinic site  will work with the clinic site 
study team to establish the final Clinic Action Plan.  This Clinic Action Plan will be largely 
based on the Standard Manual of Operations developed by [CONTACT_348765] -Diabetes 
study team, but may include some site -specific adaptations as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_348766].  The implementation of any  adaptations and their content will be recorded in the study 
database.  
 Clinic  healthcare providers  will receive disease specific and study implementation training 
(Qualtrics  Modules).  
Specific Educational I ntervention site activities  conducted by [CONTACT_348767] -Diabetes staff  
will include:

  Building a multidisciplinary  clinic site  team ( cardiology  and endocrinology /diabetes care 
specialist  leader ship pair, site research  coordinator,  patient advocate, staff for prior 
authorization and patient education)  
 Conduct ing clinic -level education related to trial protocol , 201 9 ADA guidelines5, 6, 2013  
ACC/AHA guidelines  for management of blood cholestero l9, data from recent cardiovascular 
outcomes trials in diabetes,  safety education related to prescribed medications (example, 
hypoglycemia, DKA),  and FDA label indications for relevant m edications.  
 Conduct ing clinic -level education related to drug safety, including statin side effects and 
potential side effects of anti -diabetes medications with CV benefit (such as hypoglycemia, 
DKA, etc).  
 Help ing site teams refine and implement a care pathway for managing diabetes and CV risk 
factors.  
 Implement ing audit and feedback system to improve the management of individual patients, 
and to improve systems of care in the clinics. We will establish a trial da tabase that will 
provide regular reports to each clinical site team. The reports will track the progress of each 
enrolled patient against pre -defined metrics (as per the primary outcome ) over time, and will 
also provide aggregate data across all patients i n a given site. These reports will be sent to 
site teams monthly, with the expectation that the site teams will review them monthly. In 
addition, reports from each site will be revie wed quarterly by [CONTACT_348765] -Diabetes 
National Academy Faculty, in conj unction with the clinical site teams. Feedback to providers 
at each site will occur in relation to specific enrolled patients who have yet to achieve 
optimal care (as per the primary outcome ), and will largely be carried out through direct 
communication be tween the clinical site team and the providers. In addition, EHR -based 
communication may be employed at sites with this capability.  
Specific intervention site activities targeted towards the study site staff will include:  
 Educati ng in evidence -based manage ment of patients with T2DM and CVD, as outlined 
above. This will occur at start of patient enrollment and will be standardized across sites, 
with at least one planned “booster” session during  enrollment that will also be standardized 
across sites. Addition al education sessions will be provided at the discretion of the clinic site 
teams who are monitoring the care being provided at each clinic, tailored to the needs of that 
specific clinic.  
 Adminis tering  questionnaires at study end to assess provider perspec tives on the intervention . 
Questionnaires have been developed for individual studies in the past, and we will draw from 
standard approaches used in prior similar successful studies  (including IMPACT -AF).4, 10  
 Assess ing interv ention acceptability and appropriateness  via questionnaire at end of study , 
including  assessing feedback from providers. We will develop these questionnaires to be 
specific to our intervention.  
Specific educational intervention site activities that will directly involve patients will include:  
 Consent of patients  
 Clinic  visits: Patients in the intense intervention arm will be seen by [CONTACT_348768] , either in clinic or via virtual visit, per local standard of care . Follow -up visits 
(i.e., standard of care in-person or virtual visit, or telephone call) will be conducted every 
three months  by [CONTACT_348769] .  All patients in the intervention arm 
will have two to four follow -up visits, with a minimum of [ADDRESS_433261] follow -up visit will 
CONFIDENTIAL   V 25 October 2021  
12 
 be determined by [CONTACT_102]’s enrollment date. Patient reported prescription data for 
medications of interest will be val idated by [CONTACT_348770]. All data 
collected will be entered into an electronic data capture system. Clinic visits should be 
conducted as per standard of care.   
 Labs: The following laboratory assessments are collected from the patient’ s electronic health 
record and are recommended as part of standard of care in all patients at baseline  and at the 
last follow -up visit : basic metabolic panel, HbA1c, lipid panel. As part of standard of care, 
providers will be encouraged to also order a bas ic metabolic panel 1 -2 weeks after each 
dosage change in ACEi/ARB, HbA1c every 3 months until it is <8%, and lipid panel [ADDRESS_433262] of care  and are not  required as part of the study.  
 
In both study arms, we will evaluate and compare various methods to communicate with and 
engage patients throughout the study. These engagement efforts may focus on encouraging the 
patients to enroll/comply with study requirements, and/or may focus on encouraging the patient 
to be engaged in their own health care, knowledgeable about their disease state(s), and adherent 
to their medications.  
4.[ADDRESS_433263] 12 months  of follow -up.  Shortly following the completion of 
enrollment, study sites will be notified of a specific date on which  follow -up will conclude.    
4.4 Clinic -Level Data Collection  
The following data will be collected in the clinic.  All data will be entered by [CONTACT_348771] (EDC) system.   Access to the EDC system, IBM Clinical 
Development, empl oyed for collection of the patient data will be controlled centrally by [CONTACT_348772].   DCRI data export services

6. Safety Management and Reporting of Adverse Events/ Serious 
Adverse Events  
6.1 Definition of Adverse Events  
Adverse event  
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation participant administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a 
causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable and unintended 
sign (e.g. an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the 
use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product . 
Adverse drug reaction (ADR)  
An adverse drug reaction is defined as a response to a medicinal product which is noxious and 
unintended. Response in this context means that a causal relationship between a medicinal 
product and an adverse event is at least a reasonable possibility. Adverse drug reaction s may 
arise from use of the product within or outside the terms of the marketing authorization or from 
occupational exposure. Conditions of use outside the marketing authorization include off -label 
use, overdose, misuse, abuse and medication errors.  
Seriou s adverse event  
A serious adverse event is defined as any AE which  
 results in death  
 is life -threatening   
 requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_348752]   
 results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity or is a congenital anomaly/birth 
defect  
Life-threatening in this context refers to a reaction in which the patient was at risk of death at the 
time of the reaction; it does not refer to a react ion that hypothetically might have caused death if 
more severe.  
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether other situations should 
be considered serious reactions, such as important medical events that might not be immediately 
life threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_18534]. Examples of such events 
are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for all ergic bronchospasm, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_121895]. Any suspected transmission via a medicinal product of an infectious agent is also 
considered a serious adverse reaction.  
CONFIDENTIAL   V [ADDRESS_433266] of the study to the competent regula tory 
authorities, accredited Institutional Review Boards and/or Independent Ethics Committee(s) 
(IRB/IEC(s)) in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations.  
Adverse  event reporting  to Boehringer -Ingelheim  (BI) 
Each site shall report  
(i) all ADRs (serious and non -serious)  
(ii) all AEs with fatal outcome  
(iii) pregnancies in female participants  and partners of male participants  
that are associated with the BI Drugs administered for the disease in scope of the study  (e.g., 
empagliflozin, linagliptin and its combinations by [CONTACT_348779].  
BI Unique Entry Point : 
Boehringer -Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
 FAX: 1 -[PHONE_6800]  
All serious ADRs and AEs with fatal outcome shall be forward ed immediately (within 24 hours 
or next business day whichever is shorter).  
All non -serious ADRs and Pregnancy Monitoring Forms shall be forwarded within7 days . 
The investigator carefully assesses whether an AE constitutes an ADR using the information 
below.  
DCRI is responsible for training the sites regarding the safety reporting to BI based on the 
agreement, protocol and BI training material.  
Causal relationship of adverse event  
The definition of an adverse reaction implies at least a reasonable possibility of a causal 
relationship between a suspected medicinal product and an adverse event. An adverse reaction, 
in contrast to an adverse event, is characterized by [CONTACT_49392] a causal relationship between a 
medicinal product and an occurrence is suspected.   
Medical judgment should be used to determine the relationship, considering all relevant factors, 
including pattern of reaction, temporal relationship, de -challenge or re -challenge, confounding 
factors such as concomitant medication, concomitant  diseases and relevant history.  
Causality should be assessed for each event as either “yes” or “no .” No other variation should be 
reported.  
Intensity of adverse event  
The intensity of the AE should be judged based on the following:  
CONFIDENTIAL   V 25 October 2021  
16 
 Mild:  Awareness of sig n(s) or symptom(s) which is/are easily tolerated  
Moderate:  Enough discomfort to cause interference with usual activity  
Severe:  Incapacitating or causing inability to work or to perform usual activities  
The intensity of adverse events should be classified a nd recorded according to the CTCAE  
Criteria in the NIS SAE form.  
Pregnancy  
In rare cases, pregnancy might occur in a study. Once a participant has been enrolled into the 
study, after having taken BI Drug administered for the disease in scope of the study, the 
investigator must report any drug exposure during pregnancy, which occurred in a female subject 
or in a partner to a male subject to the Sponsor by [CONTACT_348780].  
Reporting of related adverse events associated with any other BI drug  
The investigator is encouraged to report all adverse events related to any BI drug other than BI 
Drugs used for the disease in scope of the study according to the local regulatory requirements 
for spontaneous AE reporting at the investigator’ s discretion by [CONTACT_348781].  The term AE includes drug exposure during pregnancy and, 
regardless of whether an AE occurred or not, any abuse, off -label use, misuse, medication error, 
occupational exposure, lack of effect, and unexpected benefit.  
7. Statistical Hypotheses , Randomization, and Sample Size 
Determination  
7.1 Hypothesis  
The trial hypothesis is that t he primary outcome (p roportion of patients achieving guideline -
recommended management for T2DM and CVD at [ADDRESS_433267] , with a composite score of 3) will be higher  in the intensive educational intervention 
arm than in the basic education arm.   
The null hypothesi s is that the  proportion of patients achieving guideline -recommended 
management for T2DM and CVD at the last follow -up visit, as initiated or confirmed by a 
cardiologist , with a composite score of 3 will be similar between  the intensive intervention 
educational arm and b asic education arm. 
7.2 Randomization  
Site randomization: Site will be randomized when eligibility to participate in the trial has been 
established. To minimize imbalance between population characteristics in the basic education 
and intensive educational intervention groups , a stratified randomization  based on geographic 
classification (urban or non -urban) will be implemented to ensure that selected site 
characteristics are balanced within each stratum. Site randomization will be conducted through a 
databa se platform using the randomization scheme (block randomization based on stratification 
factors) generated by [CONTACT_348782]. Site management 
has a “button” on their web portal that they can select when a site is rea dy to be randomized 
(must have IRB approval and contract executed ). Randomized site will receive an official email 
with their randomization status/assignment.   
Mitigation of potential sample bias after site randomization  
CONFIDENTIAL   V 25 October 2021

 The following processes  will be imp lemented : 
 Education before randomization, after randomization, and throughout the enrollment 
process that sites should AVOID enrolling only a certain type of patient (i.e. , either high - 
or low -risk only)  
 Assessment of patient enrollment characteristics onc e 25% and 50% of patients have 
been enrolled in the trial overall and by [CONTACT_348783]. If an 
imbalance is observed , measures will be taken to visit the involved sites and remedy the 
issue with the on -site clinical leads.  
 Outcomes will be adjusted for differences in baseline characteristics, to be detailed in the 
statistical analysis plan . 
7.[ADDRESS_433268] a 10% difference between treatment arms in the proportions of patients 
achieving a composite score of [ADDRESS_433269] follow -up visit.  
In this cluster -randomized trial, where the experimental unit is site, the effective sample size and 
power is impacted by  [CONTACT_90169]-cluster correlation (ICC). For the primary outcome , the sample size 
calculation is based  on the ability to detect at least a 10% difference betwe en treatment arms in 
the proportion of patients achieving guideline -recommended management for T2D M and CVD 
with composite score of 3. The effect size of a 10% change has been chosen as a clinically 
meaningful difference between the intensive educational intervention and basic education arms.  
A minimum of 42 sites (“clusters”) with an average cluster size of 25 patients per site (a total of 
1050 patients) will provide at least 85% power to detect a 10% difference in the primary 
outcome  between  educational  intervention arms through the last follow -up visit (6 to 12 months) . 
This estimate of a minimum of 21 sites per arm ( average of 25 patients per site) is based on the 
assumption of 10% of patients in the basic education arm , and at least 20% in the intensiv e 
educational intervention arm, receiving guideline -recommended therapy at the last follow -up 
visit,  with an intra -correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.05, and two -sided type I error rate of 0.05. 
The sample size/power calculations were carried -out using R f unction “n4props” in (package 
“CRT  Size”).[ADDRESS_433270] patient. The full statistical anal ysis plan  (SAP) will be finalized before database lock. This

adjusted odds ratio and 95% CI . 
For time -to-event outcomes, multivariable Cox proportional hazards model s with shared frailties 
to account for clustering effects will b e used . Adjusted hazard ratio and 95% CI will be estimated 
from the Cox model after adjust ment  for pre -specified baseline factors. The complete list of pre -
specified adjustment variables will be described in the final study SAP . 
Baseline comparisons of participant characteristics in each arm will be summarized as the mean  
(SD), median  (25th, 75th percentiles ) for continuous variables, and as counts (percentages ) for 
categorical variables. Differences in baseline participant characteristics between randomized 
arms  will be compared using a Wilcoxon rank -sum test for continuou s variables and the 
Pearson’s chi-square test or the Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables. All trial objectives 
will be analyzed using the intention -to-treat principle.  
The primary database lock is planned after the last patient enrolled has compl eted [ADDRESS_433271] Study Plan  
In addition to the educational interventional trial, an observational analysis will be conducted in 
tandem  with a subset of sites with existing datamarts containing EHR data in a common data 
model (CDM) format.  The objectives of t his observational analysis are to  describe the clinical 
characteristics, management, and outcomes of patients with T2DM and CVD in current practice 
across an array of health systems in the [LOCATION_002] and to characterize trends in the quality of 
care for patients with T2DM and CVD over time.

the SAS -based queries will be programmed (i.e., query creation). As described below, queries 
are distributed to data partners via a secure file transfer system. Once received, data partn ers run 
the query locally against their standardized local data set, and then return the results of the query 
back for compi [INVESTIGATOR_344] (i.e., return). Data partners that are eligible to receive the baseline, 
descriptive query will be those that have populated the prescribing medication table according to 
the PCORnet C DM  and have passed all relevant data quality checks during the most recent 
round of data curation (i.e., updating, which is conducted quarterly).   
Participating EHR data partners will participate in a study cohort query in order to examine 
essential baseline, covariate, and outcome data to ensure they are correctly populated within the 
sites CDM and within acceptable boundaries of validity prior to responding to the descriptive 
queries. The study query package will be transmitted via a secure file transfer system which will 
be established for each participating site and which will be used for all queries and query results.   
Each data partner will execute the study query package locally and return re sults to the 
coordinating center for review and approval.  Upon notification that the data partner is approved, 
they will receive the descriptive query package and return results which will be compi[INVESTIGATOR_69015] a

Utilization of Hepatitis C Positive Kidneys in Negative Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]  
(USE- Hep C)  
I. Objectives  
To evaluate the safety and feasibility of transplanting kidneys from Hepatitis C virus (HCV) 
infected donors into recipi[INVESTIGATOR_794539]. Background and Rational e  
a. Background  
 
Patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) have increased mortality c ompared to their 
healthy peers with a five years survival chance of 42 -52% in hemodialysis and peritoneal 
dialysis patients respectively . Over the last decade, the number of ESRD patients has risen 
significantly. In 2015, there was over 124,[ADDRESS_1096121] in the [LOCATION_002] (1a). Kidney transplantation remains the preferred treatment modality. Successful kidney transplantation is associated with improved survival, improved 
quality of life and health care cost savings whe n compared to dialysis. However, the gap 
between patients in needs and available organs r emains large. In 2017, there were over 
94,[ADDRESS_1096122] with only 
28,588 deceased donor transplantation per formed (1). This organ shortage along with the 
advances in the available treatments of transmittable diseases such as  huma n 
immunodeficiency virus  (HIV) and hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) has prompted the transplant 
society to explore dono rs previously believed to be an acceptable candidate for donation.  
 
Traditionally, HCV donor positive (HCV D+) kidneys were offered only to HCV positive 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_555909] a 100% HCV transmission risk. Due to the low numbers of kidney transplant candidates  who are also HCV positive, many of these kidneys are discarded.  
The development of direct acting anti -viral drugs (DAAs) have transformed the realm of HCV 
therapy. DAAs has turned HCV hepatitis into a highly curable condition with cure rates exceeding 95% for all different HCV genotypes 1 through 6 (2-6).  
 DAAs can be safely used in all solid organ transplantation. Sofosbuvir/velpastasvir (Epclu sa) 
combination was used for treatment of recurrent HCV infection (genotype 1 through 6 ) after 
liver transplantation (3, 5, 7). A 12 weeks t reatment resulted in overall 96% cure rate in 
patients with and without cirrhosis. The drug combination was very well tolerated and had minimal interaction with immunosuppressants. Once daily Glecaprevir/pi[INVESTIGATOR_187761] 
(Mavyret)  combination was used to treat  HCV infection (genotype 1 through 6) in 80 liver 
transplant and 20 kidney transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_794540] -2 study (8). The overall cure 
rate was 98% at [ADDRESS_1096123] -treatment. The drug combination was again very well 
tolerated.

b. Rational e: 
DAAs are highly tolerated by [CONTACT_794562] a cure rate of >95%. This favorable side effect profile and high efficacy can help expand the pool of available organs by [CONTACT_794563]. Over the past decade, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_794541]. These donors are usually 
young with fewer comorbid conditions such as diabete s and hypertension. Organ procured 
from such donors are usually of good quality. The transmission rate of HCV when using infected organ is guaranteed but the availability of DAAs make this less of a concern. This 
scenario has been tested and proven safe by  [CONTACT_62214]. The EXPANDER (Exploring Renal 
Transplant Using Hepatitis C Infected Donors for HCV - Negative Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]) group at Johns 
Hopkins University performed transplantation of kidneys from HCV+ into 10 HCV - 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (9). The group used elbasvir -grzoprevir (supplemented with sofosbuvir for 
genotype 2, 3) started before transplant and continued for [ADDRESS_1096125] -transplant. There 
were  no trea tment related adverse effects. HCV virus was undetectable with stable liver 
function in all recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] 12 weeks after completion of treatment.  
Another group, the THINKER (Transplanting Hepatitis C kidneys Into Negative Kidney 
Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]), from the Universi ty of Pennsylvania also used similar drug combination elbasvir-
grazoprevir  (Zepatier)  in 20 HCV negative recipi[INVESTIGATOR_794542] - 1(10). The group reported a 100% transmission rate of HCV 
with 100% cure rate as evident by [CONTACT_794564] [ADDRESS_1096126] 
treatment. Ther e were  again no treatment related adverse events. Kidney allograft function 
was excellent at 6  and 12 months.  
  
The use of HCV + donors into negative recipi[INVESTIGATOR_794543] (11)  and lung (12, 13) . Patients in these reports were 
treated by [CONTACT_794565]/Ledipasvir (Harvoni) if they contact[CONTACT_794566] 1 or 
Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir if they contracted other genotypes. All of the reported cases had 
complete cure of HCV transmitted after transplant and no treatment associated adverse 
effects.   
 
Giving the large body of evidence supporting the safety and efficacy of DAAs in treatment of HCV in the transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], we at the Ohio State University, would also like to explore the safety of transplanting HCV positive kidneys into negative recipi[INVESTIGATOR_794544]. We 
hope to incorporate this a standard practice for patients who consent to receive HCV + 
donor kidney.  
 
We plan on using Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir (Epclusa) as our first therapy choice. Our choice for 
Epclusa stems from the fact it’s a daily one tablet preparation (improving patient’s 
treatment adherence), has minimal drug -drug interaction with immunosuppressive drugs, 
IRB#: 2018H0499  
Approval Date:  1/14/2022  
Version: 6.0 
and is equally effective again all different HCV genotypes without needs for supplemental 
therapy. Epclusa has been stud ied in liver transplant patients and proven to be effective and 
very well tolerated (7) . The one important caveat with Epclusa is its need for dose 
adjustment in renal failure. Hence, we plan on using Glecaprevir/Pi[INVESTIGATOR_187761] (Mavyret) as 
agent of choice in patients who develop delayed graft function or continue to have poor 
allograft function with estimated glomerular filtration rate  (eGFR ) <30 ml/min by [CONTACT_794567] -transplant. Mavyret does not require dose adjustment based on renal function 
and is equally  effective against all different HCV genotypes.  It was also studied in liver and 
kidney transplant patients and proven highly effective and well tolerated (8) . 
Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir or elbasvir/grazoprevir will be used as a third -line drug based on the 
HCV genotype in case of coverage denial of the first and second -line drugs by [CONTACT_102]’s 
health insurance.  
 
c. Significance:  
DAAs has the potential to turn HCV inf ection into a condition similar to cytomegalovirus 
(CMV ) infection. Currently, it’s a routine and completely acceptable practice to transplant 
organs from CMV+ donors to CMV - recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. These recipi[INVESTIGATOR_794545]. In the absence of preventive measures, 40 to 100% off all kidney transplant 
patients will develop CMV infection and up to 67% will develop CMV disease that could be life threatening (14, 15) . Such risk is greatly ameliorated by [CONTACT_794568], cidofovir and foscarnet . Similarly, DAAs are 
effective and very well tolerated treatment that should make transplanting HCV positive 
organs into negative donors possible.  
 
It is hard to accurately estimate the number of additional donors that could be available if HCV+ organs are being used routinely. It’s estimated that between 2005 and 2014 about 
4,144 kidneys from HCV+ donors were discarded (16). Many more kidneys from HCV infected 
donors were probably never procured because of fear of lack of appropriate recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. O ver 
[ADDRESS_1096127] these kidneys been utilized. Additionally, accepting 
kidneys from HCV+ donors can shorten patients waiting time on the deceased waiting 
list(17). This in turn results in improved survival and overall quality of life and decreased 
health care costs. A co st effectiveness analysis compared the cost associated with accepting 
HCV+ donor kidney followed by [CONTACT_794569] - 
kidney found a total cost saving of about $138,000 per patient (18). 
 
We believe HCV positive donor organs are being underutilized in the current era of DAAs. We hope to provide further proof to the safety and utility of the strategy of transplanting HCV positive donor into negative recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]. We hope such proof will encourage transplant 
leaders, organ procurement organizations, and payers to invest into building an 
infrastructure that can turn such strategy into standard of care and ensu re access and 
coverage for a variable selection of HCV therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].

This will be an open label, prospective, interventional, proof of concept study to 
evaluate the feasibility and safety of kidney transplant from HCV positive don ors into 
HCV negative donor using Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir as the preferred treatment choice for 
post -transplant HCV transmission . 
 The O hio (OSUMC ) has performed HCV+ into HCV - recipi[INVESTIGATOR_794546] 2019. OSUMC has also been performing transplant of liver and 
kidneys from donors who are HCV antibody positive but PCR negative (non -viremic 
donors) since 2016 . In order to present an overall pi[INVESTIGATOR_794547]+ organ s, we would like to review 
data from these liver and kidney transplant patients. To do so,  retrospective data from 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_794548] , and HCV antibody positive but 
PCR negative liver and kidney transplant  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_794549]. Patients who were 
treated between  January 19
th, 2016  and November 26th, 2019 will be included in our 
analysis.  
In order to confirm the safety of transplants using HCV+ kidneys, we will compare  the 
outcomes of transplant from H CV viremic donors (HCV PCR +) to those from  HCV non 
viremic doors (donors with HCV antibody neg/PCR negative and HCV antibody 
positive/PCR negative) . To do so, we will retrospectively review charts of patients who 
received a kidney transplant at OSU betwee n 1/1/2018 and 8/1/2020. This review will 
include recipi[INVESTIGATOR_794550]/PCR negative ( antibody (ab) -/Nucleic 
Antige n Test (N AT)-), HCV antibody positive/PCR negative (ab+/Nat -), and HCV antibody 
positive/PCR positive (ab+/Nat+).

1.   Why  is this study  being done ? 
 
You are being invited to participate in a study that aims to evaluate the safety of 
transplanting hepatitis C virus (HCV) infected kidneys in recipi[INVESTIGATOR_794559]. Following transplant, patients will be given very effective medicine to 
treat the HCV infection.  
IRB#: 2018H0499

Version: 6.[ADDRESS_1096142], or organ transplant. It is 
estimated that about 3.5 million people in the [LOCATION_002] are infecte d with HCV. There 
are several types of HCV , called genotypes. These are given the numbers 1 to 6 to name 
[CONTACT_794579].  
 
Hepatitis C infection describes the inflammation (redness and swelling) of the liver tissue 
caused by [CONTACT_794571]. The disease usually p roduces no symptoms and many patients do not 
realize they are infected. The inflammation of the liver usually progresses slowly over the 
years until it leads to complete scarring of the liver, or what is called “end stage liver disease  
or cirrhosis ”. Concurrent use of anti -rejection drugs can accelerate the damage caused by 
[CONTACT_794572]. Patients with end stage 
liver disease require liver transplant to stay alive.  
 
Previously, k idneys from donors infected with HCV have only been given to patients on the 
kidney transplant list who also have HCV . This is  because the virus passing to the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_794560]. Due to the low number of infected transplant patients, most of the 
infected kidneys get discarded and go without good use , despi[INVESTIGATOR_794561]. 
About [ADDRESS_1096143] anti -viral drugs 
(DAAs), and they inhibit the virus reproduction and can lead to cure of the disease.  The cure 
rate for most of these drugs range between 95 -100%. These drugs have made the 
treatment of HCV infection easy, and they are usually well tolerated by [CONTACT_1962]. We plan to 
use these drugs to treat HCV infection after transplanting infected kidneys. We believe this 
will allow us to decrease the numbers of wasted kidneys and increase the num ber of 
patients receiving kidney transplant every year.  
 
The main study drug, Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir (Epclusa), is FDA approved for treatment of 
HCV. It is a daily tablet that is given for 12 weeks. The cure rate for Epclusa is between 95 -
100% and works a gainst all 6 types of HCV. This drug has been used to treat HCV infection in 
transplant patients and has had a 96% success rate. Epclusa was well tolerated by [CONTACT_794573] -rejection medications.  
IRB#: 2018H0499  
Approval Date:  1/14/2022  
Version: 6.0 
 
Some patients may experience delayed or poor graft function. In these patients, a different 
anti-HCV drug will be used. Glecaprevir/pi[INVESTIGATOR_187761] (MAVYRET) is given as 3 tablets daily 
over 12 weeks. The cure rate for Mavyret  is also between 95 -100% and it is effective  against 
all 6 types of HCV . It has also been shown to be successful in HCV infected transplant 
patients.  
 
Other FDA approved drugs for treatment of hepatitis C, such as Sofosbuvir/Ledipasvir 
(Harvoni) or Elbasvir/Grazoprevir (Zepatier), will be used in case your health insurance 
denies coverage for first and second line therapy.  
 
Patients who have history of hepatitis B virus infection of the liver might have activation of 
their infection when taking direct anti -viral drugs (DAAs). You will be screened for HBV 
infection prior to enrollment and will not be enrolled in the study if you tested positive.  
 
If you join the study, you will receive the exact same care you would have received if you 
decided not to be part of the study. The only difference would be the addition of the study 
drug and a blood test  to monitor for HCV infection called HCV PCR. The blood work for HCV 
infection will be drawn at the same time you get your routine blood work for transplant. 
There will be no need for any additional blood testing.  
 
2.   How many people will take part in this study? 
 
We plan  to enroll 55 patients in this study.  
 
3.   What will happen if I take part in this study? 
 
After Enrollment  
Once you are enrolled in the study, your status on the kidney waiting system will be 
changed to “Accepting HCV+ organ”. Once an organ becomes available, it will be offered to 
you. You have the chance to turn down the offer and withdraw from the study at any point.

Approval Date:  1/14/2022  
Version: 6.[ADDRESS_1096144] called HCV Polymerase Chain Reaction ( PCR). The first check will be on day three post -
transplant. If this first test is not positive, you will have blood tests every week for [ADDRESS_1096145] (liver doctor) while inpatient and again only if you 
would become symptomatic.  
 
Once HCV PCR becomes positive, you will start treatment with the anti -viral drug Epclusa 
(sofosbuvir/velpatasvir). One tab of Epclusa will be taken daily for [ADDRESS_1096146] delayed graft function or poor graft function, 
you will be put on MAVYRET (glecaprevir/pi[INVESTIGATOR_187761]) instead of Epclusa. This drug requires you take 3 tablets daily for 12 weeks. If insurance denies coverage to both of these drugs, 
you will be treated with either Zepatier (Elbasvir/Grazoprevir) or Harvoni 
(Sofosbuvir/Ledipasvir). The treatment with either of these two drugs is one tablet daily for

What Are Your Responsibilities During The Study?  
In order for this study to provide good information about how the study drugs work, you 
will be asked to do the following:  
• Take all study drugs with food and as directed by [CONTACT_6814].  
• Follow the instructions of your study doctor including requirements to use 
appropriate birth control methods.  
• Come to all your scheduled visits and procedures.  Let your study doctor know as 
soon as pos sible if you are not able to attend a visit so that they can work with you 
to make other arrangements.  
• Review all the medications you are taking with your study doctor.  You may have to 
stop or adjust the dose of certain medications and supplements before or during the study.  
• Do not change, start or stop any medications without checking first with your study 
doctor.  
• Tell the study staff what medical procedures/conditions you have had in the past.  
Some procedures/conditions you may have had in the past may keep you from being in this study.  
• Tell the study staff about any health problems or side affects you are having even if 
you don't think they are important or related to the study drugs or if you have made 
any visits to other doctors or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600].  
• Tell the  study staff if you wish to stop being in the study.  
• Do not participate in any other research studies during your participation in this 
study.  
• Avoid drinking alcohol for at least [ADDRESS_1096149] -transplant.  
• In the event of an emergency, dial your local emerg ency phone number 
immediately.  
• If you require emergency care, be sure to tell the emergency care provider about 
your participation in this study.  Contact [CONTACT_794574]#: 2018H0499  
Approval Date:  1/14/2022  
Version: 6.0 
 
Study Drug Instructions:  
• You will receive specif ic instructions on how to take all of the study drugs.  You will 
have a discussion with your study doctor or staff about the importance of taking your 
study drugs with food and at the same time each day.  Should you miss taking a dose at a scheduled time, it is important that you tell your study doctor at your next visit.  If you decide to stop taking your study drugs, it is very important that you tell your study doctor right away.  
• Take and store your study drug as instructed and return the unused study dr ug 
and/or empty containers to the study doctor's office at each visit.  Do not share your study drug with anyone.  You are the only person allowed to take the study drug.  Keep the study drug and study supplies out of the reach of children and persons of limited ability to read or understand  
 
4.   How long will I be in the study ? 
 
It is difficult to say exactly how long you will be in this study since we do not know how long 
it will take for a donor organ to become available once your status is changed with UNOS  
(United Network for Organ Sharing) . However, you will be in the study for up to 1 year 
following your transplant. It is estimated that the  maximum amount of time you will 
dedicate to study specific visits is 5 hours over this 1 year perio d. This is based on need for 
study initiation visit (about 20 -30 minutes including time for blood draw), post -transplant 
HCV blood tests (variable numbers . A total of [ADDRESS_1096150] -transplant is expected 
in 99% of the patients. Less than 1% of the patients might need more frequent HCV tests , up 
to a maximum of 21 tests) and any applicable Hepatology clinic visits (approximately 30 
minutes each). You r exact time commitment will be dependent on how long it takes for you 
to have a positive HCV result and whether you require a second round of HCV treatment. 
When possible, blood draws will be done at the same time as regular transplant visits to minimize extra time commitment.  
 
5. Can I stop being in the study?  
 
You may leave the study at any time.  If you decide to stop participating in the study,  there 
will be no penalty to you, and you will not lose any benefits to which you are otherwise 
entitled.  Y our decision will not affect your future relationship with The Ohio State 
University.  If you leave the  study before transplant, you can be listed back the deceased

Risk of contracting HCV 
The main risk associated with this study is becoming infected with HCV. The likelihood that 
you will get this infection from the donor is close to 100%. However, we will monitor your blood for signs of infection very closely and we will sta rt treatment with the anti- viral as 
soon as we discover the earliest sign of infection. The cure rate with any of the anti- viral 
drugs is more than 95%. There is a very small chance (less than 5%) that you will not be cured after the first round of treatme nt. In this case, a second round (another 12 weeks for 
Epclusa or Mavyret ) of treatment will be needed. Most patients will be infection free after [ADDRESS_1096152] blood on them (e.g. razorblades, toothbrushes, needles) and to keep open cuts or wounds properly covered.   Although rare, HCV can also be pass ed through sexua l contact.

Approval Date:  1/14/2022  
Version: 6.[ADDRESS_1096153] common side effects experienced following treatment with one of the DAAs (more 
than 10% of patients) were: fatigue, headache, and nausea. Less commonly e xperienced side 
effects include insomnia, irritability, cough, skin rash, and indigestion. 
 
Sometimes people have allergic reactions to these drugs. In extreme cases, an allergic reaction may lead to death. Some symptoms of a life- threatening allergic reaction 
(anaphylaxis) are:  
• A rash  
• Difficulty breathing  
• Wheezing  
• A sudden drop in blood pressure. (making you feel dizzy or lightheaded) 
• Swelling around the mouth, throat, or eyes 
• A fast pulse 
• Sweating  
 
You should get immediate medical attention if you experience any of these signs of a serious 
allergic reaction. If you experience any side effects during the study, please contact [CONTACT_794576]. 
Reproductive risks 
Studies conducted in animal showed that Epclusa did not result in harmful effects to the fetus. However, such studies have not be conducted in humans and hence the effect of Epclusa in pregnancy is not known.  
Additionally, anti-rejection medications are known to have risks of first trimester pregnancy 
loss and conge nital malformation.  
Females : 
If you are a sexually active female able to have children, you must use two forms of contraception simultaneously unless complete abstinence from heterosexual intercourse is your chosen method. The study doctor must approve the methods of birth control that you will be using and you must agree to continue using those methods of birth control following completion of the study. 
Medically proven methods of birth control can include oral or implanted hormonal 
contraceptives like the pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382], barrier methods (e.g., condom with spermicide, diaphragm or vaginal cap with spermicide), or sexual abstinence. If you are a woman and have been surgically sterilized or you are in menopause (at least 12 consecutive months without menses) you do not need to use contraceptive methods. 
In case you discontinue study drug but continue taking mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ), a 
medicine used to weaken your immune system so you do not reject your new organ, you 
must continue using adequate contraception.

Males : 
Unless you have a previous history of vasectomy, you must agree to consistently use a 
condom during heterosexual interaction.  In addition, you must agree not to donate sperm from Study Day [ADDRESS_1096154] access to this information. 
Study drug interactions 
It is possible that ta king the study drugs with your regular medications or supplements may 
change how the study drugs, your regular medications (such as  atorvastatin, Prilosec, 
warfarin, colchicine and amiodarone), or your regular supplements work. It is very important that you tell the study doctor about all medications or supplements you are taking during the study including those you take as needed or which you take only occasionally. Your medication list will be reviewed during each clinic visit to confirm there is no dangerous or significant drug-drug interaction. 
If you stop or change your regular medication to be in the study, your health might get worse. 
Please tell the study doctor or study staff right away if you have any problems when you stop 
taking or change your regular medication. 
 
7.   What benefits can I expect from being in the study? 
 
If you decide to join the study, you will be listed on the HCV positive kidney waiting list. 
The wait time on this list is much shorter, usually between [ADDRESS_1096155] if I do not take part in the study ?

01-MAR-2019 Confidential Page 8 Sponsor: Laboratoris Sanifit Investigational Product: SNF472 Developmental Phase: Phase 2b The primary endpoint is the absolute change in coronary artery calcium volume score from baseline to Week 52. The primary analysis will use an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model to compare each of the 2 dose levels of SNF472 to the placebo group. The dependent variable will be the difference between log 52-week and log baseline calcium volume scores, with log baseline calcium volume score and treatment group as explanatory variables. This analysis will be stratified for the randomization stratification factor, i.e. baseline CAC/Agatston score. A non-binding interim futility analysis will be conducted when approximately N=120 subjects (63% of N=190) have provided Week 52 data on the primary endpoint. PK and PD analyses will also be conducted at the time of the interim analysis.

01-MAR-2019 Confidential Page 22 1 INTRODUCTION 1.1 INDICATION/BACKGROUND TO THE DISEASE 1.1.1 Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) and End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a serious condition associated with significant morbidity, premature mortality, decreased quality of life, and increased health-care expenditures. Risk factors for CKD include cardiovascular (CV) disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and obesity. As the kidneys progressively fail, a variety of metabolic and hormonal abnormalities accumulate, eventually leading to a chronic state of inflammation, malnutrition, disordered mineral metabolism, anemia, and electrolyte disturbances. These conditions contribute further to the burden of CV disease in the CKD population; increasingly it has been recognized that extra-osseous soft tissue calcification, particularly cardiovascular calcification (CVC), plays an important role in the clinical manifestation of CV disease in these patients. Patients who reach the most severe stage of CKD, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), require replacement of renal function either through dialysis treatment or renal transplantation. ESRD patients receiving dialysis therapy have all-cause and CV mortality rates that are at least 15-20 times higher than the general age- and gender-matched population (USRDS 2015, Baigent 2000). This burden of CV disease is evident upon the initiation of renal replacement therapy. Forty percent of patients starting dialysis already have evidence of coronary heart disease and only 15% are considered to have normal left ventricular structure and function by [CONTACT_200482] (USRDS 2015, Bansal 2013). As described below, the development of CVC during CKD leads to this reduction in cardiac function by [CONTACT_200483], the most prevalent form of CV mortality in this patient population.  The occurrence of ESRD, as reflected by 2013 incidence rates for renal replacement therapy, varies by [CONTACT_11338], with countries in Europe generally ranging between 90-170 per million population (pmp) and a much higher incidence in the [LOCATION_002] (363 pmp) driven by a greater U.S. incidence of diabetic ESRD (ERA-EDTA 2015, USRDS 2015). The economic burden of ESRD is far greater than its proportionate incidence. U.S. Medicare costs for ESRD exceed $32B annually, representing over 7% of total Medicare expenditures for a population that represents only 1.5% of Medicare patients (USRDS 2015). Similarly, in European countries like Italy, 2% of the annual healthcare budget is utilized for ESRD, which totals only approximately 0.1% of the general population (Pontoriero 2007). It is evident that for the ESRD population, investigation of a novel therapy to reduce the progression of CVC is an appropriate endeavor to lower the burden of morbidity and mortality in these disproportionately affected patients. Similarly, a reduction in the clinical consequences of CVC and CV disease would be expected to result in significant healthcare savings globally.

01-MAR-2019 Confidential Page 23 1.1.2 Vascular Calcification Bone serves as the storage unit for 99% of total body calcium, predominantly in the form of a calcium-phosphate moiety called hydroxyapatite (HAP). Calcium deposition outside of bone is broadly termed extraskeletal calcification and is induced in the setting of cellular necrosis, damaged proteins, or transformation of cells to an osteoblastic phenotype. An important example of the latter occurs with vascular smooth muscle cell transformation resulting in mineralization of collagen and non-collagenous proteins within the arterial wall and other CV structures. Pathologic calcification of these CV structures is known as vascular calcification. In blood vessels, calcified deposits are found in distinct layers of the blood vessel and are related to underlying pathology. Intimal calcification occurs in atherosclerotic lesions, whereas medial calcification (also known as Monckeberg’s medial sclerosis) is associated with vascular stiffening and arteriosclerosis observed with age and metabolic disorders including diabetes and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). While intimal and medial calcification may each occur independently, patients with ESRD exhibit a mixture of both intimal and medial calcification. Vascular calcification is considered an actively regulated process that may arise via multiple cellular mechanisms, including the loss of inhibitors of mineralization that are typi[INVESTIGATOR_200450]. Ultimately, no matter the initiating mechanism for vascular calcification, CKD and ESRD patients have additional exacerbating ‘passive’ mechanisms of elevated calcium and phosphorous, which combine to promote HAP nucleation and calcification crystal growth. Furthermore, evidence suggests that calcium and phosphorus may additionally have direct effects on vascular cells that predispose to mineralization.  Computed tomography (CT) scanning using electron beam, spi[INVESTIGATOR_23585], or multi-detector scanners is the most common method for quantifying CVC. Common methods for calcium quantitation in the coronary arteries include the Agatston CAC score (in Agatston units or AU) and the newer calcium volume and mass (mineral) scores. The coronary artery calcium (CAC) score is an independent risk factor for adverse CV clinical outcomes in the general population (Madhavan 2014) and has been shown to be more predictive of CV disease events than carotid intima-media thickness measurement (Folsom 2008). In contrast to the CAC score, the calcium volume score represents an actual measured volume of CAC and has been reported to exhibit reduced variability between scans. A previous clinical trial evaluating the impact of an unrelated therapy on CVC progression in HD patients demonstrated a more significant impact on calcium volume score than on the CAC score (Raggi 2011). 1.1.[ADDRESS_239281] result in an environment within the circulatory system that is ripe for the development of CVC. It has been long recognized that patients with CKD exhibit more vascular calcification than arteries from age-matched healthy individuals. Seminal findings by [CONTACT_200484] (2000) and additional work by [CONTACT_200485]. Moreover, adult patients on receiving HD therapy are reported to 
SNF472  Laboratoris Sanifit SNFCT2015-[ADDRESS_239282] velocity, reduced diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and increased systolic blood pressure (SBP). These changes lead to increases in cardiac afterload and reductions in diastolic coronary artery perfusion pressures, both of which lead to left ventricular hypertrophy, diastolic dysfunction and, ultimately cardiac failure with a predisposition to arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death. Cardiac valve calcification is a major mechanism for valve failure and predisposes to stroke, atrial fibrillation, heart failure and sudden cardiac death. CVC is also found in locations of atherosclerotic vascular lesions, although the impact of calcification on plaque rupture or stabilization in the general population has been questioned recently. Regardless, increased density of calcium in atherosclerotic plaques was associated with increased all-cause mortality in a cohort of HD patients.  Thus, the presence and progression of CVC in ESRD patients receiving HD therapy is increased compared the general population. Evidence suggests that this elevated CVC burden plays an important mechanistic role in the development of CV diseases, including heart failure, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and both CV-specific and all-cause death. The preponderance of data strongly suggests that CVC is an attractive target for an appropriate intervention to reduce the growth and propagation of calcification and potentially improve CV outcomes in the at-risk ESRD population treated with HD therapy. 1.1.[ADDRESS_239283] been investigated include pyrophosphate and bisphosphonates, thiosulfate, and vitamin K (O’Neill 2010). Each of these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_200451]. Due to the lack of available therapy, treatment is currently focused on managing bone mineral metabolism (eg, normalizing calcium, phosphorus, and parathyroid hormone [PTH]), including either minimizing vitamin D use or considering cinacalcet therapy for secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with known vascular calcification. Current treatment guidelines for the management of bone mineral metabolism disorders and related complications in CKD and ESRD patients are detailed in the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI, National Kidney Foundation).  
SNF472  Laboratoris Sanifit SNFCT2015-[ADDRESS_239284]. CVC induced by [CONTACT_200486] a major risk factor and is independently associated with CV events and death (Toussaint 2007). Coronary artery calcification is a risk factor for adverse clinical outcomes in the general population (Madhavan 2014). Patients on dialysis exhibit more severe vascular calcification than age and sex-matched individuals without CKD. Moreover, patients on HD are reported to have CAC scores as evaluated by [CONTACT_200487] (EBCT) over 5-fold higher than age- and sex-matched individuals with established coronary artery disease, but normal kidney function. In addition to the magnitude of the CAC score, the rate of progression of vascular calcification also appears to be an important risk factor for CV events including mortality. In patients with CKD and diabetes mellitus, the risk of CVC increases compared to CKD patients without diabetes (Anand 2006). Prolonged exposure to hyperglycemia is a major factor in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis in diabetes. It induces a large number of alterations at the cellular level of vascular tissue that potentially accelerate the atherosclerotic process including calcification (Aronson 2008). 1.1.5 Current Treatment Guidelines Current treatment guidelines for CKD and related complications are detailed in the KDOQI (National Kidney Foundation). There are a number of potential therapi[INVESTIGATOR_200452]. These include pyrophosphate and bisphosphonates, thiosulfate, and vitamin K (O’Neill 2010). However, most of these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_200453], and there are few controlled studies on which to base therapeutic decisions. There are no therapi[INVESTIGATOR_200454] (eg, normalizing calcium, phosphorus, and PTH), including either minimizing vitamin D use or considering cinacalcet therapy for secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with known vascular calcification. 1.[ADDRESS_239285] patients undergoing HD. SNF472 is an intravenous (IV) formulation of the hexasodium salt of myo-inositol hexaphosphate (IP6, phytate), a compound that inhibits calcification by [CONTACT_200488]. The molecular weight of SNF472 is 791.93 g/mol or daltons. IP6 is a naturally occurring substance found in beans, brown rice, corn, sesame seeds, wheat bran and other high-fibre foods. It is also present in mammalian cells and tissues at concentrations in the μM range (Shears 2001). The calcium salt of IP6 is listed by [CONTACT_200489] (GRAS). It is highly polar and poorly absorbed when given orally. When high oral doses are administered, IP6 has chelating properties in the gastrointestinal lumen preventing the absorption of cations such as calcium, magnesium and iron (Davies 1979; Forbes 1984, Pallauf 1999). Due to this property, it has been regarded for 
SNF472  Laboratoris Sanifit SNFCT2015-[ADDRESS_239286] conventional analytical techniques. Its presence in human tissues and body fluids was only shown at the end of the 1990s, after the development of sensitive assay methods (March 1998, Grases 2004, Perelló 2004). Evidence of the potential health benefits of IP6 have emerged in parallel with advances in the development of analytical tools for its determination in biological fluids and tissues. These benefits include including antitumor, antioxidant, antiproliferative and antiplatelet properties. A new extracellular role for IP6 as an inhibitor of CVC is claimed by [CONTACT_200490], which is the rationale for the development of SNF472.  SNF472 inhibits the final common pathway of CVC (Grases 2008) by [CONTACT_200491]. This effect appears to be independent of the etiology of the CVC and is present at any plasma calcium and/or phosphate levels (Grases 1999). Based on current information, it is hypothesised that SNF472 is able to slow the process of CVC by: • blocking the formation and growth of HAP crystals in the blood vessels. SNF472 is a polyphosphate with a high affinity for solid calcium salts. It quickly binds to the surface of a forming nucleus or on the faces of a growing crystal. It acts as an inhibitor of crystallisation at substoichiometric levels, since it specifically binds to the growth sites (not the entire crystal surface required) blocking the calcification process. An effect on the circulating colloidal calciprotein particles in the blood stream is also likely. SNF472 might be adsorbed on the surface of these nanoparticles, giving them negative charge and avoiding its aggregation to form the solid HAP crystal. • avoiding bone mass loss (a source of circulating calcium). As treatment, it could be used at serum concentrations far below free calcium concentrations. The target is not the free calcium in solution, but solid calcium being deposited on the vessels walls. From preclinical data, calcium chelation does not occur at therapeutic concentrations, suggesting that there will be no risk of producing hypocalcaemia with therapeutic doses. 1.2.1 Nonclinical Data SNF472 has been extensively studied in nonclinical models for efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics (PK) and toxicity, and showed a promising profile that supported progression to studies in humans. The results of nonclinical studies are summarised in the Investigator’s Brochure. In vitro and in vivo studies show that SNF472 inhibits the formation of HAP through binding to the growing sites of the HAP, thus preventing the progression of crystallisation in vessels and soft tissues in IC50 in the range of 2-3 µM. 
SNF472  Laboratoris Sanifit SNFCT2015-05 Amendment 5   Clinical Study Protocol     
01-MAR-2019 Confidential Page 27 A vitamin D model was also used to evaluate the progression of already established calcification. SNF472 was able to stop the progression of calcification when it was administered in the presence of an established calcification. In a uremic model in rats (adenine model), SNF472 showed an efficacy of 80% when given intravenously infused for 4h with a plasma concentration of 6.5 µM in free concentration. SNF472 prevented peripheral (skin) calcification in rats in 3 models of calcinosis cutis. A pharmacodynamic (PD) assay to measure the crystallisation potential of blood has been set up to use as a biomarker to predict SNF472 activity. The first validation was performed in rats where the addition of SNF472 to plasma samples, in vitro or in vivo, reduced the HAP crystallisation rate. Subcutaneous administration of SNF472 in rats reduced the HAP crystallisation potential of plasma by [CONTACT_8622] 70%. The ex vivo HAP crystallisation rate is being used as a PD measurement of the CVC reduction of SNF472 in clinical trials. Pre-clinical safety and toxicology work has been completed, including up to [ADDRESS_239287] levels (NOAELs) obtained establish a wide safety margin that provides appropriate toxicology support to proceed with exposure in long-term clinical trials. 1.2.2 Pharmacology In vitro and in vivo pharmacological characterisation has been carried out for SNF472. Phase 1 clinical trial results of the key studies are summarised in the Investigator’s Brochure. 1.2.[ADDRESS_239288] been carried out, as listed below: • SNFCT2012-03 Part A was a double-blind, randomised, phase I, single-dose, tolerability and PK study of SNF472 in healthy volunteers. • SNFCT2012-03 Part C was a double-blind, randomised, phase I, single-dose, tolerability and PK study of SNF472 in HD patients. • SNFCT2014-03 was a double-blind, randomised, phase 1b/2a, tolerability and PK study of repeated doses up to 1 month of SNF472 in HD patients.  In Part A, 20 healthy male volunteers received single ascending doses of SNF472 ranging from 0.5 mg/kg up to 12.5 mg/kg (19 volunteers) and/or placebo (8 volunteers) via IV infusion, under fasting conditions. Due to the cross-over design of the study, some of the subjects received both SNF472 and/or placebo.  In Part C, 8 male HD patients were enrolled in the study and received SNF472 (9 mg/kg) or placebo during the dialysis session over a 4-h period under fasting conditions.  
SNF472  Laboratoris Sanifit SNFCT2015-05 Amendment 5   Clinical Study Protocol     
01-MAR-2019 Confidential Page 28 In total, 18 HD patients were enrolled in the Phase 1b/2a study (SNFCT2014-03). In Cohort 1, 10 patients were enrolled. Each patient received 5 different doses of SNF472 ranging from 1 to 20 mg/kg, or placebo. Each dose was infused 3 times a week during HD sessions, in treatment periods of 1 week each. In Cohort 2, 8 HD patients were enrolled and received 10 mg/kg of SNF472 or placebo, infused 3 times a week, for 4 weeks during HD sessions. The details of these studies are provided in their respective clinical study reports (CSRs) and summarised in the Investigator’s Brochure. The Sponsor has also conducted SNFCT2015_04 (EudraCT 2014-004313-25), a Phase [ADDRESS_239289] been exposed to SNF472. No serious adverse reactions or suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) were reported and no clinically relevant safety concerns were identified. One serious adverse event (SAE) of “polycystic kidney infection” was reported in the Phase 1b/2a study. The event was not considered to be related to SNF472 and resolved without sequelae. SNF472 has been shown to be safe and well tolerated in clinical trials to date, with the exception of non-serious mild to moderate local infusion site irritations in healthy volunteers. Infusion site irritations are not expected to be an issue in HD patients as SNF472 is infused into the dialysis catheter and passed through a volume of blood of at least 200 mL before reaching the patient’s blood vessels. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), assessed as probably related to the SNF472, were infusion site pain, infusion site erythema, infusion site hypoesthesia, and infusion site swelling in healthy volunteers. TEAEs assessed as possibly related to the SNF472 were injection site bruising, headache, dizziness, pain in extremity, eyelid injury, and myalgia in healthy volunteers.  No clinically significant effects of SNF472 were observed for vital signs or laboratory values. Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis revealed no clinically significant effects of SNF472. Mild QTcB (QTc corrected by [CONTACT_35019]’s formula) prolongation was observed in healthy volunteers, although all QTcB values were under the upper limit of normal values. A limited number of ionised calcium values were available for analysis in this study; however, the available data suggested that mild hypocalcemia was the causative factor for modest prolongation in QTcB. In HD patients exposed to SNF472, no impact on QTcB was observed, potentially related to the lack of observable hypocalcemia among these patients receiving dialysis therapy. Coincident with SNF472 administration, the continuous systemic 
SNF472  Laboratoris Sanifit SNFCT2015-[ADDRESS_239290] been identified that preclude continued human investigation.  1.3 CORONARY ARTERY CALCIFICATION SCORES Coronary artery calcium level is a well-documented marker for coronary atherosclerosis (Budoff 2008). There are several methods used in the quantification of the amount of calcium in the coronary arteries. CT is the only noninvasive test with high sensitivity and specificity for calcium detection and is capable of quantifying calcification. Because of the strong correlation between the presence of coronary calcification and underlying coronary atherosclerosis, CT imaging of coronary calcium has been determined to be a good predictor of cardiac events (Madhavan 2014).  A variety of imaging results can be produced with a CT scanner, including calcium area, volume and mass. Two widely used scoring methods include the calcium volume (or volumetric) score and the CAC/Agatston score. The original work (Agatston 1990) was based on EBCT which has now evolved in today’s imaging arena to high-speed, multi-detector CT scanners.  The CAC score in Agatston units (AU) is calculated using a weighted value assigned to the highest density calcification within the coronary artery being measured. The measurement is obtained in Hounsfield units and a score assigned based on area in square millimeters and a weighted score. The sum of these measurements is then calculated to give the CAC score. It is well established that patients with CAC score > [ADDRESS_239291] an increased occurrence of coronary events (Budoff 2006, Greenland 2007). Several cohort studies, including the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis ([MESA]; McClelland 2006, 2015), the Heinz Nixdorf Recall ([HNR]; Budoff 2013, Erbel 2014) study and the ADVANCE study (Floege 2010, Raggi 2011) have used calcium scoring, specifically CAC score as primary outcome measures. The calcium volume score is another measure of CVC using CT scans. This measure has been used in several studies and has the advantage over the CAC/Agatston score in reducing variability between scans, thus improving reproducibility (Detrano 2005, McEvoy 2010, Criqui 2014). For this reason, the calcium volume score may be a more sensitive and accurate measure of CVC progression over time. Similar to the CAC score, clinical investigations demonstrate that calcium volume is positively and independently associated with the occurrence of clinically significant CV events (Criqui 2014).  1.[ADDRESS_239292] of SNF472 on the progression of CVC as measured by [CONTACT_200492]/Agatston scores in ESRD patients receiving HD. The study hypothesis is that administration of SNF472 over [ADDRESS_239293] of 2 dose levels of SNF472 (300 mg and 600 mg) compared to placebo on the progression of coronary artery calcium volume score over a 12-month (52 weeks) period in ESRD patients on HD. 2.2 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES The secondary objectives of the study are to: • assess change from baseline (Week 1, Day 1) in coronary artery calcium (CAC)/Agatston score • assess the number of patients with <15% progression in CAC/Agatston score • assess the change from baseline in thoracic aorta calcification score • assess the change from baseline in aortic valve calcification score • assess the occurrence of the composite safety endpoint: death from cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, or heart failure • assess changes in biomarkers as signals for treatment efficacy/response • assess changes in bone mineral density (BMD) • describe the long-term safety profile of SNF472 in this target population 2.3 EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE The exploratory objective is to assess changes from baseline in pulse pressure, systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP).

SNF472  Laboratoris Sanifit SNFCT2015-[ADDRESS_239303] that SNF472 is able to inhibit systemic blood calcification when plasma levels are above the calculated IC50, estimated at plasma concentrations of ~5000 ng/mL (achieved with dosing of ~ 2 mg/kg in humans). The PK-PD relationship estimated by [CONTACT_200493] a very steep dose-response curve, with ~ 70% inhibitory activity of SNF472 at 3 mg/kg and a plateau of just over 80% inhibitory activity at 5 mg/kg and higher. Multiple preclinical models of accelerated cardiac and aorta calcification in rats demonstrate that doses below 1 mg/kg produce no effect; doses of 1 mg/kg can produce ~60% inhibition of calcification; and the maximal effect of 80% inhibition is seen at doses of 3 mg/kg and higher. Thus, a steep dose response curve is also demonstrated in these in vivo models. Pre-clinical safety and toxicology studies suggest an appropriate margin of safety for the doses tested in this clinical trial. Repeated dose administration of SNF472 was studied in rats for up to [ADDRESS_239304] calcium concentration gradient across the dialysis membrane, which allows free exchange of calcium from dialysate to plasma compartments. SNF472 has been dosed for up to 1 month at 10 mg/kg in HD patients with no evidence of hypocalcaemia, local injection site irritation or other drug related toxicity. Taking into consideration the steep pharmacological activity observed with SNF472, doses of 300 mg (2.5-4 mg/kg for 75-120 kg bodyweight) and 600 mg (5-8 mg/kg for 75-120 kg bodyweight) are considered appropriate options to evaluate clinical efficacy and are well within the anticipated safety and toxicity margins for the drug.  5.3 TREATMENT ASSIGNMENT Patients will be randomised to either one of two active drug dose levels or placebo (1:1:1). 
SNF472  Laboratoris Sanifit SNFCT2015-05 Amendment 5   Clinical Study Protocol     
01-MAR-2019 Confidential Page 36 Each patient’s treatment will be given a unique code number, traceable to the batch number of the IMP. The SNF472 and matched placebo treatments will be identical in appearance. To maintain the blinded nature of the clinical trial, the same volume of solution will be administered to each patient in a treatment group. 5.3.1 Randomisation Randomisation will be used to avoid bias and to enhance the validity of statistical comparisons. Blinded treatment (active and matched placebo) will be used to reduce potential bias during data collection and evaluation of clinical endpoints. Randomisation should occur on Day [ADDRESS_239305] dose to occur on a later day than randomisation to accommodate for pharmacy/IMP preparation needs. For clarity, Day [ADDRESS_239306] dose date. Randomisation will be performed using a centralised electronic randomisation system.  Due to the strong association of baseline CAC score on subsequent calcification progression, baseline CAC score will be used as a randomization stratification factor by [CONTACT_200494] (100-399, 400-1000 and >1000). In keepi[INVESTIGATOR_200455] E9 guidance, baseline CAC score will be included in the primary efficacy analysis. 5.3.2 Patient Identification At screening, each patient will be assigned a unique 4-digit screening number which will be used as the patient identification (ID) number all throughout the study. The numbers will be sequential. The patient ID should be used on all study documents relating to the patient from screening and throughout the study. No recognisable personal patient data (names, initials, etc.) will be collected. 5.4 BLINDING, PACKAGING, AND LABELING 5.4.1 Blinding The clinical trial will be performed in a double-blind manner, i.e., the Investigator, all clinical staff, the volunteers, and the Clinical Monitor involved in the trial will remain blinded throughout the clinical trial, unless safety concerns or a regulatory requirement make unblinding necessary. 5.4.2 Unblinding The clinical trial blind should not be broken except in a medical emergency (where knowledge of the IMP administered would affect the treatment of the emergency) or regulatory requirement (e.g., for SAEs).  The decision to break the blind can only be made by [CONTACT_200495]-Investigator after consulting with the Medical Monitor. Unblinded staff members will not convey information regarding treatment 
SNF472  Laboratoris Sanifit SNFCT2015-[ADDRESS_239307] be recorded and included in any associated AE report. If an emergency unblinding becomes necessary, the Investigator should notify the Sponsor/Medical Monitor prior to unblinding, if possible, unless identification of the IMP is required for emergency therapeutic measures.  If either an Investigator or a patient is unblinded, the patient must be withdrawn from the clinical trial and procedures accompanying early termination visit will have to be performed. 5.4.3 Packaging SNF472 will be packaged, labeled, and supplied to study sites by: [CONTACT_200496]	&	Crick	Hill	Rue	Granbonpré	11	1435	Mont-Saint-Guibert,	Belgium		Phone:	[PHONE_4312]	Fax:	+32	(0)10	470	860	Email:	[EMAIL_3935]		The IMP at CSM Group will be stored in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions (-20ºC). The IMP will be labelled according to the applicable local health authority, FDA and EMA requirements. CSM Group will send the IMP to the local depots and these will then send the IMP to the Clinical Unit. All IMP shipments will be carried out on dry ice. All supplies of SNF472 must be stored on site at 5±3ºC. The preparation of the patient doses will be described in the Pharmacy Manual.  5.5 ADMINISTRATION OF INVESTIGATIONAL MEDICINAL PRODUCTS The IMP will be administered 3 times weekly in conjunction with the patient’s dialysis sessions. The IMP administration will consist of one of 2 doses of SNF472 or placebo administered intravenously during HD. The infusion should be initiated approximately 30 min after the start of the HD procedure and should take 2.5 hrs.  The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_200456]/oversee the administration of all IMPs. The exact infusion starting and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_200457] (eCRF). The appropriate volume of the IMP will be administered as a constant rate IV infusion over 2.5 hrs using a 100 mL bag of saline connected to an infusion pump, which will be connected directly to the dialysis circuit before the dialyzer via an IV giving set.

SNF472  Laboratoris Sanifit SNFCT2015-05 Amendment 5   Clinical Study Protocol     
01-MAR-2019 Confidential Page 46 unless there is clinical reason why this would benefit the patient. However, if the withdrawal does occur, the investigator will ensure that the patient is given appropriate medical care.  In the case of any event requiring medical intervention occurring during the Treatment Period, the Investigator will institute general supportive measures including, where necessary, respi[INVESTIGATOR_200460]. AEs are discussed in detail in Section 7. HD-related AEs, as listed in Section 7.2, should be recorded and indicated as such in the eCRF. [IP_ADDRESS] Bone Mineral Density BMD will be measured by [CONTACT_200501] (Step 1) and Week 52/ET visit. The methodology is described in detail in the Imaging Manual.  [IP_ADDRESS] Medical History At Screening (Step 2), the patient’s medical history will be recorded in the eCRF under the medical history section. The medical history will comprise of previous illnesses and history of drug and alcohol abuse. [IP_ADDRESS] Physical Examination A physical examination (including weight and height) will include an examination of general appearance, skin, head and neck, chest, lungs, heart, abdomen, extremities and basic nervous system evaluation. If any physical findings are abnormal, the Investigator must document the abnormality as non-clinically significant or clinically significant. Any abnormality assessed as ‘CS’ must be recorded as an AE if not explained by a coexisting condition (documented in the medical history). Weight will be measured post-dialysis as part of the physical examination. Information about the physical examination must be present in the source documentation at the study site. Significant findings must be reported on the eCRF. [IP_ADDRESS] Vital Signs Vital signs (SBP and DBP, HR, RR, and body temperature) will be assessed post-dialysis at each assessment visit after the patient has been sitting for [ADDRESS_239311] of care vital signs assessments are not being recorded into study database at each HD visit.

A TEAE is defined as an AE that begins or that worsens in severity after at least one dose of the IMP has been administered. AEs fall into the categories “non serious” and “serious” (see Section 7.1.2). Surgical procedures or laboratory values themselves are not AEs; they are therapeutic measures for conditions that require surgery or diagnose a condition. The condition for which the surgery or laboratory value is indicative for is an AE if it occurs or is detected during the study period. Planned surgical measures and the condition(s) leading to these measures are not AEs if the condition(s) was (were) known before the period of observation (see Section 7.2). In the latter case the condition should be reported as medical history. 7.1.2 Serious Adverse Event A SAE is one that at any dose (including overdose): • results in death • is life-threatening1 • requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15574]2 • results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity3 • is a congenital anomaly or birth defect • is an important medical event4 1. “Life-threatening” means that the patient was at immediate risk of death at the time of the SAE; it does not refer to a SAE that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. 2. This means that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_200461], or that one or the other occurred as a consequence of the event. 3.  “Persistent or significant disability or incapacity” means a permanent or significant and substantial disruption of a person’s ability to carry out normal life functions.

The patient may experience intolerable discomfort or pain. Grade 4 (Life-Threatening) Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated. Grade 5 (Fatal) Death related to AE Based on the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0 (CTCAE) 7.1.[ADDRESS_239315] Determination of the relationship (if any) between the AE and the study drug will be made using the guidelines below: Table 7.2 Guidelines for Determining the Relationship (if any) Between Adverse Event and the Study Drug Definite: This causal relationship is assigned if the AE starts a reasonable time after the administration of study drug, stops/improves when the study drug is stopped, and could reasonably be explained by [CONTACT_200503]. Probable: This causal relationship is assigned when the AE starts a reasonable time after the administration of study drug, stops/improves when the study drug is stopped, and could not be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_8129]’s clinical state. Possible: This causal relationship is assigned when the AE starts a reasonable time after the administration of study drug, but could be produced by [CONTACT_102]’s clinical state or other modes of therapy administered to the patient. Not Related: This causal relationship is assigned when the time association or the patient’s clinical state is such that the study drug was not likely to have had an association with the observed AE.

The cannula inserted in a forearm vein for the collection of blood samples can lead to superficial irritation of the vein, inflammation or clot formation. This will be appropriately treated by [CONTACT_200504]. 7.3 PERIOD OF OBSERVATION The AEs assessment will be carried out by [CONTACT_200505], ie, from baseline (first dose of IMP) until Week 56 (Follow-up Visit). All AEs experienced by a patient, irrespective of the suspected causality, will be monitored until the event has resolved, any abnormal laboratory values have returned to baseline or stabilised at a level acceptable to the Investigator and Medical Monitor, until there is a satisfactory explanation for the changes observed, or until the patient is lost to follow-up. 7.4 DOCUMENTATION AND REPORTING OF ADVERSE EVENTS 7.4.1 Documentation and Reporting of Adverse Events by [CONTACT_10670] [IP_ADDRESS] Recording of Adverse Events AEs will be collected from the first time a patient receives IMP until Week 52/ET; during the 1-month follow up after last dose of IMP (Week 56), only SAEs will be documented.

All AE reports should contain a brief description of the event, date, and time of onset, date and time of resolution, intensity, type of AE whether serious or non-serious, treatment required, causal relationship to IMP, action taken with the IMP, and outcome. [IP_ADDRESS] Reporting of Adverse Events All SAEs that occur during the period of observation (from the first administration of the IMP until Week 56 [or [ADDRESS_239316] dose]) whether considered to be associated with the IMP or not, must be entered into the EDC system for reporting within [ADDRESS_239317] (see Section 9.1). An alternative method of reporting will be provided to sites should they not have access to the EDC system. The Investigator should not delay initial SAE report entry due to missing data. As soon as the minimum information is available, and no later than [ADDRESS_239318] Research Organisation (CRO) and at the Sponsor that an SAE has been reported. Each initial SAE report should contain at least the following information: • sender of report (name, address of Investigator) • patient identification (screening/randomisation number, NO names, NO initials) • protocol number • details of the IMP • Investigator’s identification • AE (description, start date, outcome on the day of the report) • Investigator’s assessment of seriousness and intensity (severity) • Investigator’s assessment of causal relationship to study drug and study procedures If necessary, the Investigator will provide follow-up reports in a timely manner after knowledge of further relevant information.

Detailed SAE reporting instructions and training will be provided to study site personnel. 9.2 EMERGENCY IDENTIFICATION OF INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCTS See unblinding procedures in Section 5.4.2. 10 STATISTICAL METHODS  The primary endpoint of coronary artery calcium volume score values will be log-transformed prior to analysis. The primary analysis will use an ANCOVA model with the change in log score (log 52 week score – log week1/day1 score] as the dependent variable and with a fixed effect term for randomised treatment group and log coronary artery calcium volume score at baseline as a covariate; the model will also be stratified by [CONTACT_22055], i.e. baseline CAC/Agatston score.  10.1 GENERAL STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 10.1.1 Analysis Sets The following analysis populations will be defined: Safety, modified Intent-to-Treat (mITT), and Per Protocol (PP). The Safety population will consist of all randomised patients who receive at least one dose of IMP. Patients will be analysed according to the treatment they received. The Safety population will be used for analyses of AEs and safety endpoints. 
SNF472  Laboratoris Sanifit SNFCT2015-[ADDRESS_239322] any major protocol violations or deviations (both of which will be determined prior to final data lock and unblinding). The PP population will be used for secondary/supportive efficacy analyses. 10.1.2 Subgroups and Subsets 10.1.3 Covariates and Strata The primary efficacy analysis will be adjusted for log coronary artery calcium volume score at baseline as a covariate. The analysis will be stratified for baseline CAC score (as this is a stratification variable in the randomization). As exploratory analysis, clinically relevant covariates will be included in the analysis model, including but not limited to: age, use of non-calcium containing phosphate binder at baseline, diabetes status at baseline, and dialysis vintage. If any covariates are considered to be imbalanced across the treatment arms, then those covariates will also be included in the covariate-adjusted model to determine if they have an impact on calcification progression. 10.[ADDRESS_239323] diagnosis, use of non-calcium containing phosphate binder at baseline, and dialysis vintage. 10.2.3 Disposition Patient disposition over time will be presented overall as well as separately for each treatment arm, showing the number of patients screened, enrolled, randomised, treated, etc. Reasons for early discontinuation from study will be presented with frequencies and percentages for all categories.

Concomitant medications will be summarised with descriptive statistics by [CONTACT_200511] (ATC) Classification System (level one), generic name, and treatment group. Dialysis calcium ion concentrations will be recorded as concomitant medications. 10.3 EFFICACY ANALYSES The mITT analysis population will be considered primary for all primary and secondary efficacy analyses. Unless specified otherwise, all baseline assessments will be based upon the Week 1, Day 1 assessment. 10.3.1 Primary Efficacy Analysis The primary endpoint of coronary artery calcium volume score values will be log-transformed prior to analysis. The primary analysis will use an ANCOVA model with the change in log score (log 52-week score – log week1/day1 score] as the dependent variable and with a fixed effect term for randomised treatment group and log coronary artery calcium volume score at baseline as a covariate; the model will also be stratified by [CONTACT_22055], i.e. baseline CAC/Agatston score. LS  means for each of the [ADDRESS_239324] will be the difference in LS means between each dose and placebo and between the average of the two doses vs placebo. These contrasts and their estimated 95% CIs will be back transformed prior to presentation. P-value for each contrast will also be provided. To facilitate data interpretation, the preceding ANCOVA will be re-run but with the log of the 52-week coronary artery calcium volume score as the dependent variable (i.e., without subtracting log baseline score). This will allow estimation of the absolute 52-week score by [CONTACT_200512] a fashion that is consistent with the preceding analysis of the change in log score.  The secondary endpoint of change from baseline in CAC/Agatston score at Week 52 will be analyses in the same manner as the primary endpoint.  Underlying details of the other secondary analyses will be specified in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).

In addition to LOCF imputation, additional analyses using multiple imputation will be implemented to explore the impact of missing data. Firstly, missing data will be imputed within each arm using distribution implied by [CONTACT_11339]-missing patient data for that arm. Secondly, missing data will be imputed for all arms using distribution implied by [CONTACT_11339]-missing patient data within the placebo arm. Further, tippi[INVESTIGATOR_200464] a departure in the distribution of data from patients with missing values would have to be to render the primary endpoint analysis non-significant. 10.3.3 Multiple Comparisons / Multiplicity The trial will not be adjusted for multiple comparisons. The primary efficacy analysis (high-dose active to control) will be assessed at the 0.[ADDRESS_239326] on a variety of efficacy endpoints. Continuous variables will be analysed via ANCOVA; categorical variables will be analysed by [CONTACT_60679]-square. All-cause mortality will be displayed descriptively using the Kaplan-Meier curves, censoring subjects as of the last known contact.  Secondary efficacy variables include: • change from baseline (Week 1, Day 1) in CAC/Agatston score at Week 52 • number of patients with <15% progression in CAC/Agatston score at Week 52 • change from baseline (Week 1, Day 1) in thoracic aorta calcification score at Week 52 • change from baseline (Week 1, Day 1) in aortic valve calcification score at Week 52 • incidence of composite safety endpoint that include death from cardiovascular causes, MI, stroke, or heart failure • mortality rate (all-cause and CV) • change from baseline (Week 1, Day 1) in levels of CRP and other selected biomarkers • changes in BMD between baseline (Week 1, Day 1) and Week 52 • safety of SNF472 in terms of incidences of adverse events (AE) and serious adverse events (SAE) and clinically relevant changes from baseline in laboratory and ECG parameters

Additionally, AE summaries will be broken out by [CONTACT_200513]-up periods, all TEAEs, Sponsor-identified AEs of special interest, AEs leading to discontinuation from the study, AEs possibly or probably related to study treatment, and AEs by [CONTACT_10653] (CTCAE) severity. For all AE summaries, events will be counted only once for a given patient by [CONTACT_167956]. When an AE occurs more than once for a patient, the maximum severity and causality will be used. All AEs will be included in comprehensive data listings. A separate listing will be included for AEs leading to discontinuation from study. 10.4.2 Bone Mineral Density BMD is an indication of bone health and CKD patients may develop mineral and bone disease (CKD-MBD). To assess whether this occurs, BMD will be assessed at baseline (Week 1, Day 1) and Week 52.

01-MAR-2019 Confidential Page 60 10.6 DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE The hypothesized values for calcium volume score at baseline and Week 52 for placebo (standard of care) are provided in the table below. These data are derived from the ADVANCE trial (Raggi 2010).  The standard deviation of the change from baseline to Week 52 in calcium volume scores is estimated to be 0.30 on the log scale (Raggi 2010).  Hypothesized values for calcium volume score at baseline and Week 52 for placebo   Placebo Assumed percentage change in calcium volume score progression from baseline to Week 52 35% Expected raw calcium volume score at Week 52 assuming a raw calcium volume score of 380 at baseline (Week 1, Day 1) [ADDRESS_239329] deviation of change in log-transformed calcium volume scores from baseline to Week 52 0.30  With N=270 subjects randomized (ie, 90 per group) and 200 patients expected to provide Week 52 data, and assuming a 35% progression in CAC score on placebo at Week 52, this trial has 80% power with a 1-sided alpha level of 2.5% to test the hypothesis that the true difference between SNF472 high dose vs placebo in log CAC progression scores is 0.146.  This corresponds to a true ratio of CAC progression scores, SNF472 high dose vs placebo, of 1.157 which, in turn, corresponds to a 16.7% progression score on SNF472 high dose vs 35% on placebo.     The corresponding value for the average of the two SNF472 doses vs placebo to provide 80% power to test the hypothesis that the true difference between SNF472 average dose vs placebo alone in log CAC progression scores is 0.126.  This corresponds to a true ratio of CAC progression scores, SNF472 average dose vs placebo of 1.134 which, in turn, corresponds to a 19.0% progression score on SNF472 average dose vs 35% on placebo.   10.7 INTERIM ANALYSIS Approximately 270 subjects were planned to be randomized with N=190 expected to provide Week 52 data on the primary endpoint in the final analysis. A non-binding interim futility analysis will be conducted when approximately N=120 subjects (63% of N=190) have provided Week 52 data. The purpose of this interim analysis is to ascertain if the conditional power for achieving a statistically significant result in the final analysis of the two SNF472 doses combined would be low, ≤ 5%; if so the study may be declared futile and subject follow-up may consequently cease. There is no plan or intent to curtail follow-up at this interim for a positive efficacy finding. Conditional power is to be computed under the result observed at the interim as per Mehta and Pocock (2011).  In the event of an equivocal result of the futility analysis indicating borderline conditional power of the study, additional analyses of the same dataset will be conducted to support forward decision making regarding clinical development of SNF472. Additional analyses

01-MAR-2019 Confidential Page 61 will include primary and secondary endpoints, demographic and background characteristics, key subgroups, and PK/PD correlations with efficacy. Further details will be provided in the SAP. In addition, PD and PK analyses will be performed at the time of the interim analysis. PD as the percent inhibition of HAP crystallization and PK as the EOI plasma levels (Cmax) may be analyzed by [CONTACT_11191] (Week 1, 10, 22, and 52) or by [CONTACT_200514]. The percent inhibition and Cmax may be then used to calculate a PK/PD correlation between both parameters by [CONTACT_200515]. Further details will be provided in the SAP. 10.[ADDRESS_239330] OF THE STUDY OR PLANNED ANALYSIS Any changes to the protocol-specified analyses will be described and explained in the SAP and/or CSR. 11 REGULATORY, ETHICAL AND LEGAL OBLIGATIONS 11.1 GOOD CLINICAL PRACTICE The procedures set out in this Clinical Trial Protocol are designed to ensure that the Sponsor and the Investigator abide by [CONTACT_200516] E6 GCP and the Declaration of Helsinki and applicable amendments. The clinical trial will also be carried out according to the national and local legal requirements. 11.2 INFORMED CONSENT All patients will be required to participate in the consent process. During the consent process, the person obtaining consent will inform the patient of all elements of informed consent. No protocol specific procedures, including screening procedures will be performed until the patient has signed and dated an IRB/IEC - approved informed consent form (ICF). Study participation will start with the signing and dating of the ICF. The Investigator must ensure that the patient is given full and adequate oral and written information about the nature, purpose, possible risk and benefit of the clinical trial. Patients must also be notified that they are free to withdraw from the clinical trial at any time without prejudice to future care. The patient should be given the opportunity to ask questions and allowed time to consider the information provided. In case of protocol amendment, the Subject Information Sheet and ICF need to be revised to reflect the changes, if needed. Also, if the Subject Information Sheet and ICF are revised, they must be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_22846]/IEC, and signed by [CONTACT_200517]. 
SNF472  Laboratoris Sanifit SNFCT2015-[ADDRESS_239331] (e.g., the signed Subject Information Sheet and ICF) must be maintained in confidence by [CONTACT_737]. However, in compliance with federal guidelines regarding the monitoring of clinical studies and in fulfillment of his/her obligations to the Sponsor, the Investigator must permit the study monitor, Sponsor representative or auditor, and/or FDA representative or other regulatory authority to review the portion of the patient’s medical record that is directly related to the study. This shall include all study-relevant documentation including medical history to verify eligibility, admission/discharge summaries for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_200465] a death occurs during the study. 11.4 PROTOCOL AMENDMENTS To alter the Clinical Study Protocol (CSP), amendments must be written. Administrative changes may be made without the need for a formal CSP Amendment, but will also be mentioned in the integrated CSR. All CSP Amendments will be distributed to all CSP recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], with appropriate instructions. 11.5 APPROVAL OF THE CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL AND AMENDMENTS Before the start of the clinical study, the CSP and other relevant documents will be approved by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC/Regulatory Authorities in accordance with local legal requirements. The Sponsor must ensure that all ethical and legal requirements have been met before the first patient is enrolled in the clinical trial. This CSP should be followed exactly. The CSP Amendments must be released by [CONTACT_188554]/IEC/Regulatory Authority approval prior to implementation (as appropriate). The only circumstance in which an amendment may be initiated without prior IRB/IEC approval is to eliminate an apparent immediate hazard to a patient or patients. In such a case, however, the Investigator must notify the Sponsor immediately and the IRB/EC within 5 working days after implementation or according to the Investigator’s IRB/IEC requirements. 11.6 ONGOING INFORMATION FOR INDEPENDENT ETHICS COMMITTEE/ INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD If a safety issue of clinical relevance is identified, from review of any data, then the Sponsor will issue prompt notification to all parties ‒ Investigator and IRB/IEC/Regulatory Authorities. 
SNF472  Laboratoris Sanifit SNFCT2015-[ADDRESS_239332] on the course of the clinical trial or program (including the potential for suspension of the clinical trial program or amendments to the CSP) or warrants immediate update of the Subject Information Sheet and ICF. 11.7 CLOSURE OF THE STUDY The Investigator is required to submit eCRFs and all other relevant data and records to the Sponsor. The Investigator will complete and report (submission of eCRFs) his/her study in satisfactory compliance with the protocol as soon as possible after the completion of the study. The Investigator must submit a final report as required by [CONTACT_11577]/IEC of study completion or early termination. 11.[ADDRESS_239333] elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the IMP. However, these documents should be retained for a longer period if required by [CONTACT_200518]. 12 DATA MANAGEMENT, MONITORING AND AUDITS 12.1 STUDY MONITORING The CRO will be responsible for monitoring the trial according to GCP guidelines. Clinical Research Associates (CRAs) will conduct both central monitoring and monitoring on site. Central monitoring will include data review by [CONTACT_200519]-site, with a focus on incomplete fields and fields where potential errors could exist, based on the CRA’s understanding of the data specification. On site, the CRA will review the eCRF data entry against the source documents. Handling of queries and clarification/reconciliation of queries between the CRA and the site will be described in the eData Management Plan (eDMP). 12.2 DATA CAPTURE AND VERIFICATION Data capture and management will be conducted using the CRO’s clinical management and EDC/eCRF system. The EDC/eCRF system will be compliant with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and meet all requirements for [ADDRESS_239334] of automated and manual edit checks that are created directly in the EDC system. Edit checks will be executed on all data points defined and documented by [CONTACT_200520]. Study metrics will be reported from the EDC system. Only authorised site personnel will be able to enter/modify/correct data in the eCRF. Once all data have been verified by [CONTACT_200521], an Investigator or sub-Investigator listed on the statement of Investigators (Form FDA 1572) must sign the eCRF. 12.3 ON-SITE AUDITS During the course of the study and/or after it has been completed, 1 or more study sites may be audited by [CONTACT_200522]. The purpose of the audit is to determine whether or not the study is being conducted and monitored in compliance with recognised GCP/ICH guidelines and regulations. Additionally, the study may be inspected by [CONTACT_12721]. These inspections may take place at any time during or after completion of the study and are based on local regulations. [ADDRESS_239335]’s status at each phase during the course of the study. Subjects are not to be identified on eCRFs by [CONTACT_2300]; appropriately coded by [CONTACT_200523]. The Investigator must keep a separate log of the subjects’ names and addresses. Source documents such as the clinic chart are to be maintained separately from the eCRF to allow data verification. Because of the potential for errors, inaccuracies, and illegibility in transcribing data onto eCRFs, originals of laboratory and other test results must be kept on file at the site. Source documents and copi[INVESTIGATOR_200466]. 13.2 USE OF STUDY FINDINGS By [CONTACT_200524], the Investigator agrees with the use of results of the clinical trial for the purposes of national and international registration, publication, and information for medical

No drugs have received regulatory approval for the reduction of CV events in ESRD patients on dialysis. Large CV trials designed to show benefit of a given therapeutic intervention in dialysis patients such as Deutsche Diabetes Dialyse Studies (4D), the Evaluation of Cinacalcet Hydrochloride Therapy to Lower Cardiovascular Events (EVOLVE) trial, the Hemodialysis (HEMO) Study, and the Dialysis Clinical Outcomes Revisited (DCOR) have utilized traditional endpoints such as all-cause mortality and Major Cardiovascular Events (MACE) requiring large sample sizes and significant time to enroll and complete these studies (Wanner et al, 2005; EVOLVE Trial Investigators, 2012; St. Peter et al, 2008; Eknoyan et al, 2002). These and other similar studies unfortunately have failed to show CV benefit with the studied intervention in the dialysis population and thus, a significant unmet need remains. Identifying and assessing surrogate CV functional endpoints that are reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit ahead of large CV outcomes trials may be important to hasten development of therapeutics in this area and increase the probability of success. The main objective of the Phase 2b study is to demonstrate that SNF472 can slow the progression of CVC. If SNF472 demonstrates a significant reduction in progression of CVC in dialysis patients, it is unknown whether this reduction will translate into improvement of CV outcomes in subsequent studies. The inclusion of additional cardiovascular surrogate endpoints should inform the likelihood that reducing CVC will translate to an improvement in CV outcomes prior to subsequent larger CV outcomes trials. The selection of these surrogate endpoints is guided by [CONTACT_200529], particularly aortic stiffening as measured by [CONTACT_200530] S.1.1.

01-MAR-2019 Confidential Page 76 Figure S.1.1 Pathological Pathways through which Aortic Stiffness may Contribute to the Development of Diastolic Dysfunction 
  Adapted from Mottram et al, 2005. As shown, progressive aortic stiffening leads to a widening of pulse pressure, changes in coronary perfusion, and an increase in left ventricular (LV) afterload that results in structural and function changes in the heart and consequent diastolic dysfunction. A number of these surrogate clinical endpoints have been well studied in the dialysis population and have been demonstrated to be relevant predictors of CV morbidity and mortality including left ventricular mass (LVM), diastolic function, myocardial strain, left atrial (LA) size and function, and PWV, the latter as a measure of arterial wall stiffness.  The hypothesis for this Sub-Study is that improving the burden and progression of CVC will slow the progressive aortic stiffening and also improve left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and diastolic dysfunction. To explore these hypotheses, additional surrogate endpoints are being evaluated in the Sub-Study, namely PWV, an indicator of aortic stiffness, LVMI, diastolic function, and LA structure and function. A scientific rationale and justification for inclusion of these endpoints is provided below.

01-MAR-2019 Confidential Page 77 1.1.2 Considerations in the Selection of Cardiovascular Endpoints The use of surrogate structural and/or functional CV measures in this Sub-Study provides an opportunity to assess the effect of SNF472 on arterial and LV structure and function (Rubin et al, 2011). Whereas it is recognized that CV structural/functional surrogate markers are not equivalent to clinical outcomes, the evaluation of the impact of SNF472 on these surrogate endpoints should provide valuable information about potential CV effects of the drug and will guide the design of future trials. In general, we selected endpoints which are:  1. Plausibly modified by [CONTACT_200157]472 via the drug’s hypothesized effects on reducing vascular calcification, arterial stiffness, and secondary effects on LV afterload;  2. Considered clinically relevant, and have been previously studied in patients with ESRD in particular. The clinical relevance was established based on the following considerations:  a) Positive effects on these endpoints can reasonably be expected to mediate a potential clinical CV benefit of SNF472;  b) Endpoints represent quantitative traits that can be obtained non-invasively, accurately, reproducibly, and with minimal risk to trial subjects;  c) Endpoints are independently predictive of prospective CV risk in various populations, particularly among patients with ESRD;  d) Whenever possible, available data demonstrates that modification of the endpoint by [CONTACT_200531].  Aortic PWV Large artery stiffness is a highly relevant phenotype in CKD. Arterial stiffening impairs the ability of conduit arteries to accommodate the stroke volume intermittently ejected by [CONTACT_200532], thus increasing the pulsatile hydraulic load to the LV (Chirinos and Segers, 2010a; Chirinos and Segers, 2010b). In addition, given the effect of arterial stiffness on pulsatile hemodynamics, increased large artery stiffness can also promote excessive penetration of pressure and flow pulsatility into the kidney and the brain, leading or contributing to target organ damage (O’Rourke and Safar, 2005).  PWV is a functional parameter affected by [CONTACT_200533], which is intimately related to the incremental elastic modulus (Einc) of the wall material, as demonstrated by [CONTACT_200534]-Korteweg equation (Chirinos, 2012).  Arterial stiffness increases with aging and various disease states, including kidney disease (Payne et al, 2010). Large artery stiffness increases with declining kidney function (Hermans et al, 2007; Mourad et al, 2001). In the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) study unadjusted analysis indicated that each 10 mL/min/1.73m2 decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was associated cross-sectionally with a 0.5 m/s increase in aortic PWV (Kaminski et al, 2011; Townsend et al, 2010). Available studies demonstrate that carotid-femoral (CF) PWV, an index of large artery stiffness, independently predicts the risk of incident CV events across a number of patient populations, including high risk populations with hypertension, diabetes, and ESRD (Chirinos et al, 2014; Vlachopoulos et al, 2010; Mattace-Raso et al, 2006; Boutouyrie et al, 
SNF472  Laboratoris Sanifit SNFCT2015-05 Amendment 5   Clinical Study Protocol     
01-MAR-2019 Confidential Page 78 2002). In a recent meta-analysis of 17 longitudinal studies across a number of different patient populations, each 1 m/s increase in aortic PWV resulted in an age-, sex-, and risk factor adjusted increase of 14% in total CV events and 15% in CV mortality. Each [ADDRESS_239349] deviation increase in PWV, which averaged about 3 m/s, was associated with a 47% increase in total CV events and a 47% increase in CV mortality (Nakanishi et al, 2017). Importantly, among these [ADDRESS_239350] populations, which showed increased risk for CV events and mortality consistent with the other populations from studies included in the meta-analyses. Available evidence also demonstrates the prognostic value of PWV across the spectrum of CKD severity (Sulemane et al, 2017). In subjects with CKD stages 4 and 5, aortic PWV is independently related to renal function decline (Chen et al, 2013a; Tripepi [CONTACT_2297], 2007). CF-PWV is also an independent predictor of incident heart failure in CKD (Chirinos et al, 2014).  Importantly, among patients on hemodialysis, longitudinal changes in measures of aortic PWV in response to an intervention were predictive of future risk for mortality. In a study of 150 hemodialysis patients reported by [CONTACT_200535], mean aortic PWV was higher at baseline (11 m/s compared with 9.5 m/s) and rose over time in those who died during follow up, despi[INVESTIGATOR_200469] a fall in PWV and a parallel reduction in mean arterial pressure was observed over time (Guerin et al, 2001). A number of studies haves established an important link between arterial calcification and PWV across populations, including those with ESRD. Arterial calcification is an independent correlate of increased pulse pressure (a surrogate of aortic stiffness) in ESRD (Kraus et al, 2015). Aortic and superficial femoral artery calcification is associated with increased aortic stiffness in healthy individuals (McEniery et al, 2009) and in patients with CKD (Toussaint et al, 2008; Sigrist et al, 2006). In a rodent model of CKD, aortic calcium content measured by [CONTACT_200536] (Ng et al, 2011). Among 48 patients with CKD (GFR 17-55 mL/min), abdominal aortic and superficial femoral artery calcification, aortic vascular calcification correlated positively with PWV (Toussaint et al, 2008). Similarly, among 134 subjects with advanced CKD (60 hemodialysis patients, 28 peritoneal dialysis and 46 patients with CKD stage 4) increase in calcification of the superficial femoral artery as measured by [CONTACT_200537]-PWV and increased pulse pressure (Sigrist et al, 2006). Observational studies suggest that higher dialysate calcium is associated with a transient increase in PWV, probably from a smooth muscle effect (Mac-Way et al, 2011); however, one study suggested that a higher dialysate calcium was associated with an increased progression of PWV over a 6-month period (Mac-Way et al, 2011; LeBeuf et al, 2011). Left ventricular mass LVH is associated with CKD (Hee et al, 2014). Approximately [ADDRESS_239351] LVH. LVH is also highly prevalent in earlier stages of kidney disease and is more prevalent with worsening renal function. Levin et al reported prevalence rates of 27%, 31% and 45% of LVH among CKD patients with a creatinine clearance >50 mL/min, 25-50 mL/min and <25 mL/min, respectively. The major correlates of LVH in this study were systolic hypertension and anemia (Levin, 2003). LVH is a common cardiac abnormality 
SNF472  Laboratoris Sanifit SNFCT2015-[ADDRESS_239352] with varying incidence of 36% to >90% in incident and prevalent dialysis patient populations (Di Lullo et al, 2011; Foley et al, 2010; Foley et al, 1995; [COMPANY_005] et al, 2008; Hayashi et al, 2013; Satyan et al, 2007; Madsen et al, 2007; Dimitrijevic et al, 2009; Virga et al, 2006; Kutlay et al, 2006). LVH is a strong independent predictor of the risk of adverse CV events (such as coronary events, heart failure and death) in the general population and in patients with CKD (Dubin et al, 2017; Gardin et al, 2004; Gardin et al, 1997; Koren et al, 1991; Levy et al, 1990). The regression or worsening in LVH is strongly predictive of subsequent cardiac events among patients on dialysis (Paoletti et al, 2004; Zoccali et al, 2004). In addition, regression of LVH in response to therapy independently predicts a favorable prognosis (Lantelme et al, 2008; Levin et al, 1998), supporting the use of LVM as a useful surrogate endpoint of the clinical benefit of therapeutic interventions (Wachtell et al, 2007; Devereaux et al, 2004). In the Losartan Intervention For Endpoint (LIFE) study, a 11% reduction in LVMI with therapy was associated with a 15% reduction in relative risk of cardiovascular events, which was independent of the degree of blood pressure lowering (Wachtell et al, 2007; Devereaux et al, 2004). Importantly for this particular trial, a 10% reduction in LVM achieved by [CONTACT_200538] a relative risk of 0.72 for CV death among patients with advanced hypertensive kidney disease (London et al, 2001).  Although the pathophysiology of LVH in CKD is complex, hemodynamic load is a key factor contributing to LVH in this population. In the presence of a normal aortic valve, LV afterload is largely dependent on the properties of the arterial tree (Desai et al, 2011; Nicholas, 2011) including aortic stiffness. Among [ADDRESS_239353] (Nitta et al, 2004). Furthermore, longitudinal changes in LVM in 55 patients with stage 3/4 CKD were shown to be independently associated with aortic stiffness. Over 2 years, among patients with initial normal LV indices, 68% showed no appreciable change with time while 32% developed LVH, whereas among those with initial LVH, 50% maintained elevated LV indices and 22% regressed. Factors to maintaining or achieving normal LVM included age, a lower pulse pressure and a higher GFR (McMahon et al, 2004). Interestingly, PWV has been shown to be independently associated with LVH in ESRD even in the absence of hypertension, consistent with the fact that hemodynamic load, as opposed to blood pressure per se, is related to LVH in this population (Lin et al, 2002).  LV diastolic function and filling pressures LV diastolic dysfunction is highly prevalent (~85%) in advanced CKD, with greater than 1/3 of patients demonstrating grade 2 or higher diastolic dysfunction. Diastolic dysfunction is a strong predictor of mortality in patients with stage 4-5 CKD (Farshid et al, 2013). Among patients with ESRD, the ratio of mitral inflow early diastolic peak flow velocity (E) to mitral annular velocity (e’) is indicative of an increased LV filling pressure and predicted all-cause mortality and CV death independently of LVM and LV ejection fraction (LVEF) (Wang et al, 2008; Sharma et al, 2006).  In other studies that included patients with stage 3-5 CKD, a high E/e’ was independently associated with CV events, mortality and progression to dialysis (Kim et al, 2013; Chen et al, 
SNF472  Laboratoris Sanifit SNFCT2015-05 Amendment 5   Clinical Study Protocol     
01-MAR-2019 Confidential Page 80 2013b). Similarly, among 578 patients enrolled in the African-American Study of Kidney Disease (AASK) cohort, LV hypertrophy and diastolic function parameters predicted cardiovascular events requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_200470]; a renal composite outcome of doubling of serum creatinine or ESRD; and heart failure. After adjustment for LVM and clinical variables, lower systolic tissue Doppler velocities were significantly associated with future heart failure events (Peterson et al, 2013). However, in the CRIC study, which included 3939 racially and ethnically diverse individuals between the ages of 21–74 years old with eGFR between 20 and 70 mL/min per 1.73 m2, diastolic dysfunction assessed by [CONTACT_200539] (Dubin et al, 2017). The differences between these 2 studies may be due to differences in the study cohorts. In the AASK trial, all subjects were African American, diabetes was an exclusion criterion and 50% of participants in the AASK had a history of prior CV disease. In contrast, the CRIC study included an ethnically diverse cohort with diabetes and excluded those who self-reported heart failure. Diastolic function is also correlated with aortic stiffness and PWV and calcification (Fujiu et al, 2008; Weber et al, 2008; Borlaug et al, 2007). In a study that included [ADDRESS_239354] and arterial stiffness estimated by [CONTACT_200540]-ankle PWV were independently associated with the E/e' ratio (Fujiu et al, 2008).  In summary, diastolic function is an independent predictor of outcomes in ESRD. Further, given the association with PWV and vascular calcification, improvement in these parameters may translate into improvements in diastolic function. LV longitudinal strain and strain rate Myocardial deformation (strain) is a highly sensitive measure of myocardial function, even in patients with preserved ejection fraction (EF). Strain is defined as the percent change in length, relative to a reference length, a given direction. For the LV, the end-diastolic length is used as the reference length. LV strain in the radial, circumferential and longitudinal directions can be measured with 2D-echocardiography, using speckle-tracking echocardiography. In speckle tracking echocardiography, small stable myocardial footprints (“speckles”) are tracked throughout the cardiac cycle using digital echocardiographic images. Strain in the longitudinal direction has been shown to be the most clinically significant parameter in a variety of clinical conditions (Collier et al, 2017).  Longitudinal LV strain measured with speckle-tracking echocardiography has been shown to be reduced in CKD (Pressman et al, 2015; Chen et al, 2014; Wang et al, 2012) even in the absence of overt systolic dysfunction measured by [CONTACT_44990]. Reduced LV longitudinal strain demonstrates a progressive reduction with worsening stages of renal dysfunction (Panoulas et al, 2015; Krishnasamy et al, 2014; Liu et al, 2011). Reduced LV strain has also been associated with CKD even in patients with established heart failure with preserved EF (Unger et al, 2016).  Multiple studies demonstrate the high clinical relevance of LV strain in CKD. Among 108 patients with stage 3/4 CKD, reduced (i.e., less negative) global longitudinal strain (GLS) is associated with a reduced submaximal exercise capacity (6-minute walk distance)

01-MAR-2019 Confidential Page 81 and health-related quality of life (Krishnasamy et al, 2016). Among 106 patients with CKD, no history of CV disease, and normal LVEF, a reduced GLS was predictive of a composite endpoint of all-cause mortality, acute coronary syndrome, stable angina requiring revascularization, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_200471], over a median follow up period of 49 months, independently of other predictors and CF-PWV (Sulemane et al, 2017). Among 88 stable hemodialysis patients with preserved LVEF followed-up for 25.6±9.9 months, a reduced GLS was an independent predictor of all-cause mortality (Liu et al, 2013). Across the spectrum of CKD severity (stages 1-5), GLS is also predictive of all-cause mortality (Krishnasamy et al, 2014) and CV events (Panoulas et al, 2015).  Importantly, strain is a more sensitive marker of myocardial function in CKD than the LVEF, and predicts incident events independently of EF and measures of diastolic function. In a study including [ADDRESS_239355] and preserved LVEF, GLS was independently predictive of all-cause mortality during a median follow-up of 1.9 years, whereas LVEF was not. The association between GLS and mortality persisted after adjustment for multiple potential confounders, including LVEF (Pressman et al, 2015). The prognostic value and clinical significance of GLS in patients with CKD above and beyond LV EF is further supported by a study among 183 patients with stage 4-5 CKD (63% on dialysis). During a median follow up of 7.8±4.4, GLS was a significant predictor of all-cause and CV mortality after adjustment for relevant clinical variables including LVMI and EF. GLS also had greater predictive power for both all-cause and CV mortality compared to EF. Furthermore, reduced GLS (less negative than -16%) was associated with a 5.6-fold increased unadjusted risk of CV mortality in patients with preserved EF (Krishnasamy et al, 2015a). In another study that included 89 patients with advanced CKD (43 non-dialysis patients and 43 dialysis patients) followed for 70.2±35 months, reduced GLS was the only significant echocardiographic predictor of survival in non-dialysis CKD patients, whereas among dialysis patients, GLS and the E/e’ ratio were significant predictors of survival (Valocikova et al, 2016).  Importantly, reduced longitudinal systolic function is associated with arterial stiffness in patients with CKD. Among 136 patients with moderate CKD (stages 3 and 4), GLS measured with speckle-tracking echocardiography was independently associated with CF-PWV (Krishnasamy et al, 2015b). This is consistent with the known effect of afterload on LV longitudinal function, even in patients with preserved EF (Chirinos, 2017; Chirinos and Segers, 2010a; Chirinos and Segers, 2010b; Weber et al, 2008). Therefore, it is highly plausible that an intervention that reduces aortic stiffness can have a positive impact on LV strain. Whereas one study suggests that GLS demonstrates little sensitivity to removal of volume during hemodialysis (Panoulas et al, 2015), another study demonstrated a ~1.5% absolute reduction in GLS with hemodialysis (Choi et al, 2008). These data have implications regarding the timing of the dialysis session and volume status of the dialysis patient. Therefore, to the extent possible we will standardize the time of the echocardiogram relative to dialysis session in the trial.

01-MAR-2019 Confidential Page 82 LA size and function LA size is a well-established marker of CV risk in general and among patients with CKD in particular. Among 200 patients with creatinine clearance <60 mL/min followed-up for 3.7 (3.5-4.0) years, LA size was independently predictive of CV mortality (Chan et al, 2008). Among 289 unselected consecutive patients referred for transthoracic echocardiography, patients with stage 3 or 4 CKD (n=49) demonstrated a higher LA volume index (LAVI) than controls. Furthermore, CKD, hypertension and a larger LAVI were independent predictors of a composite endpoint of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, and congestive cardiac failure (Hee et al, 2014). LA size has also been shown to predict CKD progression (Chen et al, 2013a). Importantly, longitudinal changes in LA size have been shown to predict subsequent fatal and nonfatal CV events in patients on hemodialysis, independently of baseline LA volume and LVM (Tripepi [CONTACT_2297], 2007).  LA size is independently associated with PWV (Lantelme et al, 2008), consistent with the effects of aortic stiffness on LV afterload and diastolic function. Given that methods for the assessment of LA strain are relatively novel, data regarding the correlates of reduced LA strain in ESRD are not yet available. However, given the importance of diastolic dysfunction on LA function, it is likely that aortic stiffness can influence LA strain through effects on LV load.

It is recommended that the echocardiographic assessments be performed on non-dialysis days (see Echocardiography Manual) since this period permits better control of hydration status and is associated with the least intravascular volume.  The echocardiographic assessment for Sub-Study Entry can be performed up to [ADDRESS_239363] 4 weeks of treatment may not be characterized as a true “baseline” assessment, it is not expected that clinically significant changes in the progression of vascular calcification will occur in treatment arms during this short time period. Therefore, the overall assessment of change in PWV and other echocardiographic measures from the time period of the initial intervention at study entry to end of study should not be affected by [CONTACT_162383]. Therefore, to increase subject participation and the feasibility of performing the Sub-Study, a window of time from weeks 1-4 will be allowed to consent subjects for Sub-Study participation and to complete the initial echocardiographic assessments.

The Sub-Study mITT will be made of subjects in the overall mITT set who consented to participate in the Sub-Study. Similarly, the Sub-Study PP set will be made of subjects in the overall PP set who consented to participate in the Sub-Study. 6.2 DEMOGRAPHICS AND BACKGROUND CHARACTERISTICS The treatment groups in the Sub-Study will be descriptively summarized for baseline (main study) demographic and disease history variables using the Sub-Study mITT set. The baseline characteristics and diagnostic factors of those subjects included in the Sub-Study will be informally compared to the baseline characteristics and diagnostic factors of those subjects not included to ensure there are no major differences of clinical relevance. 6.2.[ADDRESS_239364] diagnosis, use of non-calcium containing phosphate binder at baseline, and dialysis vintage. 6.3 EFFICACY ANALYSES 6.3.1 Primary Efficacy Analysis The primary Sub-Study endpoint, absolute change in PWV (m/s) from Sub-Study Entry to Week 52 measured by 2D echocardiography, will be summarized using descriptive statistics (by [CONTACT_2939]) and analyzed using an ANCOVA model with the Week [ADDRESS_239365] will be the difference in LS means between each dose and placebo and between the average of the two doses vs placebo. These contrasts and their estimated 2-sided 90% CIs will be back transformed prior to presentation. The 1-sided P-value for each contrast will also be provided.  As recommended by [CONTACT_148188] (Townsend et al, 2015), additional analyses will be performed after adjustment for mean arterial pressure and heart rate.

If no such value is available multiple imputation will be implemented. by [CONTACT_200545]-missing patient data for that arm. As an additional analysis, missing data will be imputed for all arms using distribution implied by [CONTACT_11339]-missing patient data within the placebo arm. 6.3.3 Multiple Comparisons / Multiplicity The analyses for the Sub-Study are viewed as exploratory and no adjustments for multiple comparisons/multiplicity are planned. 6.3.4 Secondary and Exploratory Efficacy Analyses The secondary endpoints of this Sub-Study are provided in Section 3.2.2. The secondary and exploratory endpoints will be summarized using descriptive statistics by [CONTACT_200528]-Study endpoint; ANCOVA with the value at Sub-Study Entry and treatment as the explanatory variables. The results will be summarized both in tabular form and graphically as forest plots (2-sided 90% confidence intervals for the pairwise treatment comparisons to control). As these analyses are viewed as supportive, no adjustment for multiple testing is planned. For the endpoint related to aortic valve gradient, evidence of aortic stenosis at Sub-Study Entry will be defined as subjects with a mean aortic valve gradient >[ADDRESS_239367] of co-existing valvular disease on LV strain, LV diastolic function parameters and LA strain, we will perform a sensitivity analysis excluding subjects who demonstrate more than moderate left sided regurgitant valvular disease (aortic regurgitation, mitral regurgitation) and/or more than mild mitral or aortic stenosis at baseline. These criteria for sensitivity analyses will not apply for assessment of aortic PWV.  6.4 DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE The sample size (up to approximately 65/placebo and 130/active) is considered adequate to provide preliminary estimates of the change from Sub-Study Entry for the treatment arms and the treatment effect (placebo vs. the pooled active arms) of the primary endpoint for the Sub-Study. Assuming a standard deviation in the change from Sub-Study Entry of 1.75 m/s in PWV, the test of the difference between the placebo and active arms (pooled) would have approximately 85% power to detect a true difference of 0.75 m/s (1-sided alpha level of 0.05 for the proof-of-concept objective) for these sample sizes. This threshold is considered clinically significant based on results of previous studies discussed in Section 1.1.2.

01-MAR-2019 Confidential Page 95  APPENDIX 2. PROTOCOL AMENDMENT 1: SUMMARY OF CHANGES This section describes the changes in reference to the Protocol Incorporating Amendment 1. The primary purpose of this amendment is to add the Sub-Study, an opt-in Investigator addition of echocardiographic assessments, to measure reduction in progression of CVC on arterial stiffness for exploratory analyses on subjects participating in the main study and willing to provide additional informed consent. Additionally, this protocol was amended for administrative updates and to clarify procedural details. The justification for the each of the changes to the protocol is listed below. 1. Addition of opt-in Sub-Study echocardiographic assessments at 3 time points: Sub-Study Entry, Week 28, and Week 52/Early Termination. See addition of Appendix 1 for complete details and endpoints.  Justification: The main objective of the Phase 2b study is to demonstrate that SNF472 can slow the progression of CVC. If SNF472 demonstrates a significant reduction in progression of CVC in dialysis patients, it is unknown whether this reduction will translate into improvement of CV outcomes in subsequent studies. The inclusion of additional cardiovascular surrogate endpoints should inform the likelihood that reducing CVC will translate to an improvement in CV outcomes prior to subsequent larger CV outcomes trials. The selection of these surrogate endpoints via echocardiographic assessments is guided by [CONTACT_200529]. 2. Increase the Screening Period duration from 21 days +/- 3 days to 28 days +3 days. Justification: To allow sites more time to schedule subjects for required screening CT and Dexa scans with radiology facility/personnel for inclusion into the study. 3. Changed number of participating countries from 5 to 3. Justification:  Updated to reflect actual number of countries participating:  [LOCATION_003], [LOCATION_006], Spain 4. Changed “Indication” being studied from ESRD to Cardiovascular Calcification (CVC) in ESRD. Justification:  More accurately reflects patient population under study. 5. Clarified PK and Biomarker sample collection information. Should be done ~[ADDRESS_239370] a -70 freezer. Justification:  Clarification to time of collection from previous “end of infusion” was not specific enough. Sites now can be provided dry ice for same day sample shipments, as needed. 6. Updated section 5.3.[ADDRESS_239371] day of dosing to be on different days, if needed. Justification:  To accommodate for pharmacy/IMP preparation time needs. For clarity, Day [ADDRESS_239372] dose date. 7. Updated 5.4.3 Packaging supplier name. Justification:  Former “B&C” supplier was acquired by [CONTACT_200549]. 
SNF472  Laboratoris Sanifit SNFCT2015-05 Amendment 5       
01-MAR-2019 Confidential Page 96  8. Deleted B&C Group to ship and store of biomarker samples. Justification:  Central laboratory being used for the study is providing storage. 9. Section 9.[ADDRESS_239373] updated. Justification:  Provided more specific safety contact [CONTACT_200550].

01-MAR-2019 Confidential Page 97  APPENDIX 3. PROTOCOL AMENDMENT 1.1 UNITED STATES ONLY  Section 5 specifies that the study drug is to be added to a 100 mL bag of physiological saline (0.9% sodium chloride) and administered via an infusion pump which is connected directly to the dialysis machine via an IV giving set and an accessory heparin line. The infusion should be given at a constant rate over 2.5 hours.   Due to the shortage of 100 mL saline bags, sites that are unable to obtain 100 mL saline bags can use saline bags with a volume of 150 mL or 250 mL. The preparation and administration of the study drug will be the same, however, the infusion rate will be adjusted to allow the infusion to be completed in 2.5 hours (see table below).  Additional fluid should be removed as necessary according to the site’s standards of care.   Bag Volume (mL) IMP Volume (mL) Total Volume (mL) Infusion Rate (mL/hr) 100 mL 20 mL 120 mL 48 mL/hr 150 mL 20 mL 170 mL 68 mL/hr  250 mL 20 mL 270 mL 108 mL/hr

01-MAR-2019 Confidential Page 99  APPENDIX 5. PROTOCOL AMENDMENT 2 SUMMARY OF CHANGES  The main goals of this amendment are to increase the upper limit of the CAC score allowed for enrollment from 2000 AU to 3500 AU, to clarify the planned sample size re-estimation, to clarify the endpoint descriptions, and provide additional details on planned statistical analyses, including those in the substudy. Additional description and rationale for the changes is provided below. 1) Minor revision to primary objective and primary endpoint to remove “absolute change”.  Rationale: Results will be analyzed on a log scale to give results that can be presented as absolute change or percent change. Sections: Synopsis, Section 2.1, Section 10.3 2) The secondary endpoint “percent change from baseline in calcium volume score at Week 52” was deleted.  Rationale:  This information will be provided as part of the primary endpoint. Sections: Synopsis, Section 10.3.4. 3) The secondary endpoints “absolute change from baseline in CAC/Agatston score at Week 52” and “percent change from baseline in CAC/Agatston score at Week 52” were consolidated to “change from baseline in CAC/Agatston score at Week 52”. Rationale: Results will be analyzed on a log scale to give results that can be presented as absolute change or percent change. Sections: Synopsis, Section 10.3.4. 4) Description of the composite safety endpoint “death from cardiovascular causes, MI, stroke, or heart failure” was standardized throughout the protocol to clarify and specify that it included deaths only from cardiovascular causes and not all-cause mortality.  Sections: Synopsis, Sections 3.2.2, [IP_ADDRESS], 10.3.4 5) It is now specified that C-reactive protein (CRP) is one of the biomarkers that will be assessed. Sections: Synopsis, Section 6.2.3 6) The safety endpoint was revised to add “clinically relevant changes from baseline in laboratory and ECG parameters.”  Sections: Synopsis, Section 10.3.4. 
SNF472  Laboratoris Sanifit SNFCT2015-05 Amendment 5       
01-MAR-2019 Confidential Page 100  7) A blood pressure exploratory objective and endpoint were added.  Sections: Synopsis, Sections 2.3, 3.2.3, and 10.3.4  8) Inclusion Criterion 2:  The maximum allowable CAC score has been increased from 2000 AU to 3500 AU: “CAC score of 100 to 2000 3500 AU”.  Rationale: After additional literature review and consultation with medical experts the Sponsor believes that subjects with higher CAC scores are at risk of cardiovascular events and may benefit from therapeutic intervention. Raising the CAC limit to [ADDRESS_239374] patients. Sections: Synopsis, Sections 4.1 and [IP_ADDRESS] 9) Revision of the primary endpoint analysis method to, “The dependent variable will be the difference between log 52-week and log baseline calcium volume scores, with log baseline calcium volume score and treatment group as explanatory variables. This analysis will be stratified for the randomization stratification factor, i.e. baseline CAC/Agatston score.”  Rationale: Clarification of methods and stratification factor Section: Synopsis and Section 10.3.1 10) Figure 5.1 was revised to more accurately show the location of study drug infusion. 11) Correction of the definition of concomitant medications in Section 6.2.6 to “Medications taken with or after the first dose of IMP will be considered concomitant medication.” 12) Conditions for removal of patients from the study (Section 8.1) has been revised so that patients will not be withdrawn from the study for missed doses. The following sentence was deleted, “Patients who missed 12 consecutive doses (4 weeks) of the IMP or 24 aggregate doses will be considered as non-compliant and will be withdrawn from the study.” In addition, Investigators are asked to contact [CONTACT_200551] a patient from study medication or withdrawing a subject from the study. 13) Statistical Methods: Clarified that the primary efficacy analysis population is a modified ITT (Section 10.1.1 and Appendix 1 Section 6.1.1). Methods for imputation of missing data were added (Section 10.3.2). Details and clarifications on blinded sample size re-estimation procedure were provided and a nonbinding futility analysis was added (Section 10.6). Additional methods and clarifications were provided throughout Section 10. 14) The objective “Change from Sub-Study Entry in aortic valve gradient” and corresponding endpoint of “Absolute change in aortic valve gradient from Sub-Study Entry to Week 28 and Week 52 in all subjects and in subjects with evidence of aortic stenosis at Sub-Study Entry” were added. Sections: Appendix 1, Substudy Sections 2.3, 3.2.3, 6.3.4  
SNF472  Laboratoris Sanifit SNFCT2015-05 Amendment 5       
01-MAR-2019 Confidential Page 101  15) Clarification was provided that the first echocardiogram can occur within [ADDRESS_239375] dose of study drug (Section [IP_ADDRESS]). 16) Investigational Drugs. Notation was added that US SITES ONLY may use 150 mL or 250 mL bags of physiological saline for dilution of the IMP if 100 mL bags are not available. The preferred bag size for dilution of the IMP remains 100 mL. This allowance was previously communicated to US Sites as Protocol Amendment 1.1 as described in Appendices 3 and 4. 17) Additional minor administrative changes and changes to version numbering and dates were made throughout.

01-MAR-2019 Confidential Page 102  APPENDIX 6. Protocol Amendment 3 Summary of Changes  The amendment provides a revised sample size calculation which led to a reduction in planned enrollment from approximately 450 to approximately 270. There are no changes in study visits or procedures. Additional details are provided below. 1) Changed planned sample size from approximately 450 to approximately 270. Sections: Synopsis, Sections 3.1, 4, 10.6 Rationale: To expose the minimum number of subjects needed to achieve 80% power based on the revised sample size calculation. 2) Removed details of planned sample size re-estimation (SSRE, Section 10.6). Rationale: Because of the revised sample size, the previous considerations regarding SSRE are no longer germane.  3) Revised sample size calculation (Section 10.6). Rationale: The previous versions of the protocol based sample size on the anticipated Per Protocol Population, however, the primary efficacy analysis will be carried out on the modified ITT Population (Section 10.1.1) with last observation carried forward (LOCF) imputation for missing data (Section 10.3.2). To establish consistency the sample size calculation has been revised to more appropriately use the modified ITT Population. In addition, the Sponsor has determined that 80% power with 2-sided significance level of 0.[ADDRESS_239376] to the previously planned 85% power. 4) Clarified the definition of the Per Protocol population (Section 10.1.1). The PP population is the subset of the mITT population who do not have any major protocol violations or deviations. 5) New Appendix 5 containing the summary of changes for Amendment 2 6) Revisions of amendment number and date throughout.

01-MAR-2019 Confidential Page 103  APPENDIX 7. Protocol Amendment 4 Summary of Changes   1) Added phosphorus (phosphate) to the list of analytes in the safety laboratory assessments (Table 6.1) and the list of biomarkers Section 6.2.3. Rationale: Corrects omission of a standard analyte and clarifies list of biomarkers. 2) Clarification that IMP must be added to the dialysis circuit before the dialyzer (Section 5.5). Rationale: Clarification 3) Addition of a non-binding interim futility analysis to be conducted when approximately N=120 subjects (63% of N=190) have provided Week 52 data on the primary endpoint. PK and PD analyses will also be conducted at the time of the interim analysis (Synopsis, Section 10.7, Section 14).  Rationale: To allow the Sponsor to assess whether there is a low probability of success of the trial and to determine that the PK and PD characteristics of SNF472 are as expected. 4) New Appendix 6 containing the summary of changes for Amendment 3 5) Revisions of amendment number and date throughout.

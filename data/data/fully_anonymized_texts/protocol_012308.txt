Statistical Analysis Plan for  the study of  
Ankle Robot to Reduce Foot Drop in Stroke  
 
This document lays out the analysis plan we intend to use for the study  of 
whether robot -assisted treadmill training will result in greater improv ements in gait and 
balance among chronic stroke survivors with foot drop impairment.  
 
1.0 Brief description of the design of the parent study.  
After baseline data collection, eligible patients were  randomized to receive either 
treadmill with anklebot (TMR) or standard treadmill TM alone.  Randomization was 
based on permuted blocks in two strata defined by [CONTACT_126470].  Subjects in 
each group were  be expected to attend [ADDRESS_142383] of the Primary Hypotheses.  
 
2.1 Outcomes. The main outcomes to be considered will be: : 
 
AIM 1  
• peak DF swing angle (Var=”Pk DF P -ank)  (Primary Outcome)  
• DF angle at foot strike (Var=”AIC”)   (2nd Primary Outcome)  
• Mean Gait Velocity   (Var=”Prefered Gaid Velocity w/o AD”)  
• A-P GRF Propulsion  (Var=”AP impulse”)  
 
AIM 2  
• Extent of Postural Sway (Var=”EO Sway Are a” or “EC Sway Area”)  
• Peak paretic A -P forces during push -off nonparetic gait initiation (Primary 
Outcome for Aim 2.  (Var=”Gait Initiation Peak NP A -P force” ) (Not 
collected for last 10 -15 patients)  
  
 
All these outcomes will be treated as quantitative random variables.  
 
 2.[ADDRESS_142384] of assigning a patient to TMR 
vs. assigning them to TR.  The principle of intention -to-treat will be violated to the 
degree that outcomes for some patients at some t imepoints are missing.  The 
implications of missing data and how we will handle that are discussed below.  
Secondary analyses (described below) will be performed to using different analysis 
samples  to estimate different causal parameters.  
 2.[ADDRESS_142385] of TMR vs TR, for each outcome, 
we will fit the following model:  
 
E(Outcome)=β 0 +  β1F1 + β 2F2  + β 3F3 + β 4F1(TMR)  + β 5F2(TMR) + β 6F3(TMR) +  
   β(Covariates)     
 
where F1, F2, and F3 are indicators for the three follow -up measures, and TMR is an 
indicator that the patient was in the TMR group.  In this model, β 4 , β5, and β 6 stand for 
the difference between TMR and TR at each of the three follow -up time points.  Th e 
primary analysis will be based on β 4.  This model will be fit using restricted maximum 
likelihood, allowing for different variancs  at each time point, and different covariances 
between any two time points (this is sometimes refered to as an “unstructured” 
variance/covariance assumption).  We will allow a different variance/covariance 
structure in each intervention group.  However, if  the differences in the estimated 
variance/covariance structures are not statistically significant  (based on a likelihood 
ratio test) , we will assume a common variance/covariance structure in the final model.   
 This model will provide valid inference if t he distribution of outcomes do es not 
markedly depart from normality.  If an outcome appears to depart from normaility by 
[CONTACT_126471] a great deal of positive skewness (e.g., skewness coefficient greater than 
3.0), I will fit the above model using a log -tranformed version of the outcome.  
2.4 Covariates .  Covariates will be included in the model if they are statistically 
significant (p<0.05) predictors of the outcome.  This will reduce residual variation and 
increase power.  Up to [ADDRESS_142386] stepwise manner .  Covariate will be 
chosen from the following candidate variables.

Baseline Paretic A -P Propulsion in Late Stance (N -s)

[ADDRESS_142387] of being assigned to TMR  assuming that the data are 
missing at random, given all observed data.  That means, essentially, that conditional 
on all observed outcomes, the distribution of the missing outcomes is not different than 
the distribution of the observed outcomes.  However,  if there are departures from the 
missing -at-random assumption (e.g., if those with the worst outcomes are the ones who 
fail to return for follow -up visits), then the estimated rates of improvement may be 
biased.  Note, however, that the estimated treatmen t effect would only be biased if there 
were differential degrees of departure from the missing -at-random assumption in the 
two treatment groups.  
The proposed approach is somewhat resistant to biases due to missing data 
because it is based on maximum likeli hood estimation and takes into consideration all 
the observed data.  Thus, for example, if a patient has missing outcomes for the second 
follow -up visit, but has been observed at other time points, the estimation of the 
outcomes at the second follow -up wil l be implicitly imputed based on the observed 
outcomes and the included covariates.  
  
3.[ADDRESS_142388] of TMR on the following secondary outcomes:  
 
 AIM 1  
• Single support duration  (Var=”P -SS%”)  
• Double support duration  (Var=”DS%”)  
• Timing of peak fexion  (Var=”PK DF P -ank %cyc”)    
• Pareti foot vertical clearance  (Var=”p -foot clearance”)  
• Steps/day in two consecutive days  (Var=”48 hr Ste p Count “)  (There 
seems to have been a lot of non -adherence regarding this measure and it 
may not be usable)  
• Stroke Impact Scale ( Var=” SIS Mobility” ) 
 
AIM 2  
• coP trajectories of APAs during gait initiation by [CONTACT_126472]  (Not measured)  
• Berg Balance Scale  (Var=”Berg  Balance”)  
• DGI scale  (Var=”DGI”)  
• ABC Scale  (Var=”ABC”)  
 
3.[ADDRESS_142389] of the TMR (relative to TM) among those willing and able to come to most of the 
sessions.  We would expect to see a somewhat greater effect of TMR in this analysis 
because it will remove those who did not attend the TM sessions.

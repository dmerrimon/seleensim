RESEARCH PROTOCOL
Protocol Title: Testing and Tuning a Multiparameter Exercise Detection Algorithm
Principal Investigator: [INVESTIGATOR_290315] [EMAIL_5686] 
Sponsor: National Institute of  Diabetes and Digestive and  Kidney Diseases
BACKGROUND
The risk of hypoglycemia in individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D) increases considerably  
during exercise. Increased  glucose utilization during exercise as well  as promotion  of insulin 
sensitivity, both during and after  exercise,  have been shown to  occur  with  prolonged  periods  of 
increased insulin  sensitivity  even after a single bout of intense physical activity. As a  result,  
many patients with T1D experience fear of and reluctance to  pursue physical activity, in order  to 
avoid the discomforting symptoms associated  with hypoglycemia.
The artificial  pancreas, a  device used  for automatic delivery of insulin and  glucagon 
subcutaneously to subjects  with T1D, is paving the way to  revolutionize the management of this  
disease. Already, the  benefit of improved  glycemic  control compared to current open-loop pump 
therapy has  been  demonstrated in several trials.  We have shown that  our artificial pancreas (AP) 
algorithm dual hormone system effectively manages  blood glucose in  a clinic setting and  our 
group specifically has shown  great  progress  using  glucagon to reduce hypoglycemic  epi[INVESTIGATOR_290316] 1-3. Our  most recent inpatient study, as yet unpublished, shows  that adjusting 
insulin and glucagon delivery during closed  loop treatment, after announcing exercise, 
effectively reduces mean time below a glucose  level  of 70 mg/dl when compared to  closed  loop  
control without  adjustments. We utilized initial  open-loop  data from this study to help devise 
dosing changes for the AP algorithm 4.
In order  to prepare for a future  home  study,  the ability  to detect, grade, and classify physical 
activity so  as to appropriately adjust system parameters is vital in helpi[INVESTIGATOR_290317]-
induced hypoglycemia in the home  setting. Currently, our closed-loop system transmits heart rate 
and accelerometry  outputs  from  a Zephyrlife BioPatch  monitoring device to a  Nexus [ADDRESS_354168]  exercise 
Protocol 2015.03  Version Date: 07/7/16
2and automatically  trigger algorithmic adjustments to reduce exercise-related  hypoglycemia  
during and  after  exercise in individuals with T1D.
SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES
Primary Objective: To  obtain  accelerometer,  heart rate, and optionally  VO 2 data from subjects 
with and without T1D  during  various  home related activities and formal exercise for the purpose 
of training an  exercise  detection algorithm.
Secondary Objective: To obtain  data  from insulin pumps and glucose sensors from subjects 
with T1D during open-loop  therapy  while  exercising  to further define changes  in glucose level  
while performing home activities and formal exercise.
HYPOTHESIS
We hypothesize that  an exercise detection algorithm that utilizes accelerometer and heart rate  
data along with  patient parameters, such as age, sex, weight, height, sitting and resting heart rate,  
can accurately and  reliably estimate  energy expenditure. We also hypothesize that certain home 
exercises may  be of sufficient  intensity to trigger  a fall in glucose  levels,  which would require 
dose adjustment during closed-loop treatment of  T1D  in order to  prevent hypoglycemia.
ENDPOINTS:
Primary Endpoints: The primary endpoints are accelerometer and heart rate  data from both 
healthy subjects  and subjects with T1D and  healthy  subjects during  home activities and a  
structured exercise period.
Secondary Endpoints: Secondary endpoints include glucose data from  Dexcom  continuous 
glucose monitoring (CGM) systems and  insulin  pumps  attached  to subjects with T1D  during  
home activities and formal  exercise.

OVERALL STUDY  DESIGN
The aim of  the study is  to determine if accelerometer, heart rate,  and VO 2 data can be utilized to 
enhance our  exercise detection algorithm for  use in our  closed-loop system.  The VO 2 mask  may  
be worn by [CONTACT_290329] a single exercise  visit  to determine the  actual  energy  expenditure of 
each activity using metabolic equivalents (METs).  Each subject may wear one  or more 
monitoring devices  which will be transmitting heart rate and  accelerometer  data  to a master  
controller, such as a  Nexus  [ADDRESS_354173] and grade exercise, and will be  collecting  data  for offline  analysis and algorithm tuning. 
This device will  not be connected to a  glucose  sensor, a pump  delivering insulin or a pump 
delivering glucagon for the purpose of managing  blood sugar in  subjects  with T1D.
STUDY DETAILS
Visit 1: Screening
Screening will  take place at OHSU’s Harold Schnitzer Diabetes Health Center clinic Prior to any 
procedures, the  consent/authorization form  will be reviewed and signed,  with  a copy of the 
consent/authorization form given to the subject.  The original will be kept for the source 
document. This visit  will take  approximately  1.5 hours for healthy subjects.
In all  subjects, study personnel will review medical  history and medications, and fill  out the 
Physical Activity  Readiness Questionnaire  (Appendix A); height, weight, pulse, blood pressure,  
and a resting EKG will be obtained;  a study investigator will perform a physical  examination, 
excluding breast and  pelvic exams; and females of child-bearing potential will take a  urine  
pregnancy test, which must be negative to participate. A study investigator  will assess 
inclusion/exclusion criteria and review the subject’s  medical record for clarification as needed.  
Subjects may  be asked to be fitted  with a portable VO [ADDRESS_354174]. The TID subjects 
Protocol 2015.03  Version Date: 07/7/16
6and the healthy subjects will be randomized  separately to ensure  that there are equal numbers 
within each arm of the study, as follows:
 
1)Aerobic exercise at  OCTRI followed  by [CONTACT_290330],  or
2)Activities  of daily  living  and resistance exercise at the POC lab followed by [CONTACT_290331]  T1D are 
affected by [CONTACT_290332]  (ADLs) or aerobic 
vs. resistance  exercises.
T1D Subject Screening Specifics : This screening  will take approximately [ADDRESS_354175] 
their blood  sugar using their own meter  and strips. Venous blood  samples will be taken for 
complete blood  count, and complete metabolic panel  (including creatinine, liver panel,  and 
electrolytes) labs. If subjects have  had the aforementioned  labs performed within the 3 months  
prior to the intended date of Visit  2 and  we can access  the results, venous blood  samples will not 
be taken. These  subjects  will be fitted with a Dexcom G4,Share, or Dexcom G5  Mobile glucose 
sensor and short device training  will be performed  at the screening. The subjects that require 
blood tests will be asked to return for an  approximately 15-30 minutes  sensor  training and 
insertion visit if their lab  results determine that they  pass screening. 
Visit 2: Exercise Study  
For all  subjects,  the exercise visit will occur within  12 weeks of  screening. For T1D subjects, the 
exercise visit will occur no less than 24 hours and no more than  5 days from  the time of  sensor  
insertion. 
Subjects with T1D will always  be asked to check their capi[INVESTIGATOR_290320] (CBG) before  
driving to the  clinic and to bring a snack  in the car in case hypoglycemia  does occur (in  which 
case, subjects must  park and treat the hypoglycemia).
This visit will  take approximately  [ADDRESS_354176]  at the OCTRI Clinical research unit as 
well as the  Biomedical Engineering Point of Care  (BME  POC) Lab. A study technician and 
Protocol 2015.03  Version Date: 07/7/[ADDRESS_354177] at 6 am. 
Subjects will be  instructed to arrive at OCTRI or BME  POC  lab around  8 am depending on their 
randomization group. Subjects  with T1D will measure their capi[INVESTIGATOR_290321] (CBG)  with  
their own glucose meter at  the beginning of the visit. Subjects with T1D will continue their 
normal basal  insulin  delivery using their own pump and will be allowed to adjust insulin delivery 
during the structured exercise  period as they normally would at home. All  subjects will be  fitted 
with a device to record  accelerometer and heart rate  data, and may be  fitted with the portable 
VO 2 mask.
During the aerobic exercise  period  and resistance exercise period, there will be defined  rules for 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007], including:
1)If the subject feels unwell,
2)If a subject with T1D develops hypoglycemic  symptoms, such as excessive sweating, 
shaking/tremors, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], feelings of dread or panic,  light-headedness,  nausea, 
difficulty concentrating or the like,
3)If the subject develops chest  pain/pressure,
4)If the subject develops undue  shortness of breath,
5)If the maximum  heart  rate (defined as 220 – the  subject’s age) is reached or exceeded,
6)For patient preference.
The study technician  and physician will accompany the subject up and  down the tram between 
the two portions of  the visit (from  OCTRI to CHH or CHH to  OCTRI).
Aerobic Exercise: During the aerobic exercise  event,  all subjects will perform exercise on a 
treadmill or  cycle ergometer in three [ADDRESS_354178] 
between each exercise period. Exercise intensity will vary between periods  to achieve different 
energy expenditures,  which may be determined  based  on VO2 measurements.  Subjects with T1D 
will do a CBG prior to exercise and will not start exercising if glucose is <70 mg/dl; they will be given 15-20 grams  of carbohydrates  for CBG  values  of <70 mg/dL  and CBG retested  in [ADDRESS_354179]-testing hypoglycemia. 
ADL and Resistance Exercise: T1D subjects will complete a CBG prior to  starting  this exercise  
period if ADL and resistance  exercise  is their first exercise of Visit  2. If the T1D subject has just 
come from aerobic exercise, they will not need  to complete  a CBG  prior  to starting  this period. 
Activities simulating  normal household activities will be completed in  the Point of Care Lab.  
These activities may  include:
1)sitting on a chair or  lying on a bed,
2)washing dishes or  folding laundry,
3)sweepi[INVESTIGATOR_290322],
4)organizing a room or adjusting furniture in a room,
Protocol 2015.03  Version Date: 07/7/16
85)scrubbing  the carpet or the walls and/or
6)going up and down  flights  of stairs.
Each activity will be  performed between 5-[ADDRESS_354180] a CBG sample taken and reviewed  by [CONTACT_2413]. If necessary, oral carbohydrates will 
be given for values below  70 mg/dl, and  an insulin bolus will be given if deemed appropriate by 
[CONTACT_54851]  250 mg/dl. Study staff  will download the data from the 
subject’s personal insulin  pump.
Visit 3: Study  Follow-up
The study follow-up visit  will be conducted  by [CONTACT_290333], to determine the general post-discharge status of the subject.   The  
subject will be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] 48 hours (+/- 24 hours) after the exercise portion of the study takes place.
CONFIDENTIALITY AND  PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS
Risks and Benefits:
Risks: The risks of the protocol  procedures are considered  minor.  It should be noted that  a fully 
trained physician will be in constant  attendance  on the research  ward. The likelihood of 
significant harm is  quite low. Risks of exercise  include falls, sprains, bruises, very low risk of 
bone fractures and head trauma.
In subjects with T1D, there is a small risk of sensor  fracture, and in  such a case, a pi[INVESTIGATOR_290323]. For  this reason, the study investigator will 
inspect each removed  sensor  for the possibility of breakage or fracture. Any  evidence of sensor 
breakage will  be recorded and reported to FDA and the sensor company.
Benefits: The subject may  not directly  benefit from being in this study;  however, their  
participation may help to  advance automated insulin and glucagon delivery technology.

Data Analysis:
All data will be  actively  streamed to the master controller on the Nexus 5 phone  and will be  
analyzed online  with a currently described exercise detection  algorithm  5. The  algorithm  results 
will be compared  to data from the  VO2 mask in order to  assess the sensitivity and  specificity  of 
the algorithm, and may also be used  to improve upon the parameters of the  algorithm.  
Additionally, glucose data from CGM devices will be  analyzed  for the rate of change of glucose 
(in mg/dl/min) during exercise events in order  to help quantify this for different activities. Model

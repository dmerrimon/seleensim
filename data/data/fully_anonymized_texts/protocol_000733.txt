1. HYPOTHESIS  
Pathologic complete response (pCR) is associated with improved survival and low er risk for 
distant metastases. Neoadjuvant Endo -HDR will increase pCR rates compared to concurrent 
chemoradiation (RT + Capecitabine).  We expect similar locoregional control, decreased 
treatment time (1 week as opposed to 6 weeks), improved sphincter pre servation rates, and lower 
acute and chronic toxicity.  
2. ELIGIBILITY  
Patients with low rectal cancer who are candidates for endorectal brachytherapy (non -obstructing 
lesions which can be adequately treated with this technique will be eligible for the study).   Distal 
rectal tumors at 1 4 cm or less from the anal verge  or rectosigmoid junction  are included. Patients 
with T4 and/or presumed pathologic iliac/inguinal lymphadenopathy on PET/CT or MRI (>1.5 
cm in diameter or necrotic appearing)  are excluded.  
3. BACKGRO UND  
3.1 Rationale  
Locally advanced rectal carcinoma continues to be a major oncologic problem in the 
[LOCATION_002] with approximately 40,000 new cases diagnosed in 201 2 For stage II/III 
rectal carcinoma, adjuvant chemoradiation  (1-3) and total mesorectal excis ion  (TME) (4, 
5) represent the major treatment advances that have increased cure rates over the past 30 
years.  
  
In the setting of TME, a landmark phase III German trial of stage II/III rectal cancer 
patients established neoadjuvant 5FU -based chemoradiati on (NCRT) as standard of care 
over the same regimen given post -operatively  (6). The preoperative arm showed superior 
local control (6% vs. 13% p=0.006), a complete pathologic response of 8%, a higher rate 
of sphincter preservation and less grade [ADDRESS_59322] -operative treatment. 
However, disease -free and overall survival (76% versus 74%, respectively) were no 
different because of the high rate of distant metastasis occurring in over 1/3 of patients 
(5yr DM 36 vs 38%,  p=0.84). Importantly, tho se attaining a pathologic complete 
response had a decreased rate of distant metastasis and improved disease -free survival. 
Drawbacks to the regimen include acute grade 3 or 4 toxicity in 27% of patients, low 
compliance rates with postoperative chemotherapy  (27 – 50%), and an overall decline in 
anorectal function shown by [CONTACT_7419] -term studies  (6).  
 
Given the excellent locoregional control reported in TME surgical series, several trials 
have investigated whether certain patients may be spared preoperative radio therapy  (7-9). 
Two large randomized trials by [CONTACT_54932] a short 
preoperative course of hypofractionated EBRT (25 Gy in 5 fractions) followed by [CONTACT_54933] 2/[ADDRESS_59323] likely to benefit from radiotherapy.  In these patients, preoperative radiation was 
shown to decrease locoregional recurrence by 5 -fold (10% to 2%); ho wever, the 
J1360 CORRECT

Version 7.0  May 19, 2020  
 
 
7 
 hypofractionated preoperative EBRT regimen was associated with a significant increase 
in acute and chronic morbidity.  Indeed, the Dutch study revealed that irradiated patients, 
when compared to surgery alone, had more perineal wound healing pro blems after 
abdominoperineal resection (29% vs. 19%), worsening deterioration of anal sphincter 
dysfunction, and more severe long -term effects related to sexual functioning both in 
males (p=0.004) and females (p<0.002)  (10-12). Additionally, colleagues hav e reported a 
consistent negative impact on bowel function in those patients undergoing sphincter 
preservation  (13). In reviewing the long -term data of the Swedish short course 
preoperative EBRT rectal cancer trial, Birgisson also  reported a higher inciden ce of 
secondary tumors (9.5%) in patients treated with preoperative radiation when compared 
to patients having surgery alone (4.3%)  (14).  
 
Modern approaches to address the risk of distant metastasis and poor compliance with 
adjuvant systemic chemotherapy ( following NCRT) have incorporated newer effective 
chemotherapy agents earlier in the treatment protocol. For example, oxaliplatin has been 
one of the most widely studied agents as a result of its proven efficacy when combined 
with 5 -fluorouracil and leucov orin (FOLFOX) both in the metastatic and adjuvant 
settings for colon cancer(15). Initial phase II studies with the addition of oxaliplatin to 
standard [ADDRESS_59324] NCRT.  However, two phase III trials clearly show that the 
addition of oxaliplatin during 5FU -based NCRT does not significantly improve 
pathologic complete response, locoregional control, distant metastasis or survival but 
does increase acute grade 3 -4 toxicity b y two to three -fold (16, 17).  
 
One approach to limit toxicity from external beam radiotherapy is the use of intensity 
modulated radiation therapy (IMRT).  IMRT can limit radiation dose to normal rectum 
(above and below the tumor) and surrounding organs at  risk (OARs) such as bladder and 
sexual organs.  IMRT utilizes multiple beams of radiation to treat the rectal tumor plus a 
margin and limits dose to OARs. While IMRT decreases radiation dose to normal 
structures, it requires an additional 2 -3 cm margin fo r microscopic extension (clinical 
treatment volume=CTV), set -up error, and rectal motion (planning treatment 
volume=PTV). Furthermore, IMRT still requires 5 -6 weeks of radiation with concurrent 
chemotherapy,  is substantially more expensive than conformal radiation, and is 
especially prohibitive in countries where access to technology necessary for IMRT is 
limited  (20).  Based on the preliminary results of RTOG [ADDRESS_59325] NCRT.  
 
A novel approach to limit radiation toxicity is the use of high dose rate endorectal 
brachytherapy (Endo -HDR)  (21). Endo -HDR involves the placement of a silicon 
multicatheter applica tor within the rectum to deliver large doses to the rectal tumor and 
mesorectum with rapid dose fall off to the surrounding organs. An Iridium 192 high dose 
rate brachytherapy source attached to a wire is inserted into each catheter to deliver a 
high dose of radiation therapy the tumor. High dose rate brachytherapy has been well 
established in various malignancies (prostate, uterine, sarcoma, head and neck) to 
escalate radiation dose to the tumor over a short period of time while sparing normal 
J1360 CORRECT  
Protocol Chair:  Amol Narang, M.D.   
Version 7.[ADDRESS_59326] delivers treatment internally to the 
tumor without having to pass through surrounding normal tissue and organs. It requires 
smaller margins (CTV/PTV=~1 cm) on the tumor since the applicator is positioned under 
fiducial gui dance over the tumor without need for a margin for organ motion allowing 
greater sparing of OARs  (22). Furthermore, the area of the rectum exposed to high dose 
radiotherapy is surgically removed at the time of resection which further minimizes 
chronic toxi city. Important structures that may be spared include bone marrow, small 
bowel, bladder, the autonomic nerves, sexual organs, anal sphincter and skin. 
Considering that 1/[ADDRESS_59327] is the shortened treatment time (1 versus 6 weeks).  Endo -HDR therefore provides a 
major logistic adv antage for patients who may benefit from neoadjuvant therapy but who 
are geographically distant from radiation centers, elderly, or medically infirm ed. 
 
At the McGill University Health Center (MUHC), Vuong reported a phase II trial using 
high dose rate bra chytherapy without concurrent chemotherapy to treat 285 (260 T3 
tumors, 7 T4 tumors, and 18 T2 tumors and 38% were N+) rectal cancer within 10 cm 
from the anal verge from 1998 -2007. The median age was 69 years (range 42 -90) (23). 
Patients received four fra ctions of 6.5 Gy (26 Gy total) HDR -BT treatments in one week 
followed by a [ADDRESS_59328] endoscopic visualization with the tumor bed defined as any 
visible disease seen in at the primary site or mesorectal nodal deposits. Patients with node 
positive disease at the time of surgery received adjuvant chemotherapy and EBRT. At a 
median follow -up time of 54 months, the 5 year actuarial local recurrence rate is 5%, 
with a doubling of pathologic complete response compared to standard chemoradiation 
(27%), < 1%  grade 3 -4 acute toxicity and no apparent increased long -term toxicity when 
compared to p atients treated with TME alone. The disease -free survival is 65%, and the 
overall survival rate is 68%  (23). Those patients attaining a pathologic complete response 
had improved survival and fewer distant metastasis. Grade 1 -2 proctitis was noted in all 
patients starting 7 –10 days after therapy and continuing until resection. While one patient 
experienced grade 3 toxicity, none had grade 4 proctitis. Surgical complications were 
limited to an anastomic leak rate of 10% and a perineal wound infection rate of 12% 
comparable to standard surgical experiences alone. Importantly, Endo -HDR did not 
compromise the pelvic bone marrow function and was  not associated with hematologic 
toxicity. Based on these promising results, a current NCI Canada trial randomizes rectal  
cancer patients  treated with Endo -HDR followed by [CONTACT_54934] - vs. post -
operative FOLFOX.  
 
Although these are promising results supporting the use of Endo -HDR, a theoretical 
concern of using this treatment strategy to treat only the primary site an d adjacent 
mesorectal nodes is the potential for increased pelvic nodal recurrence without elective 
treatment with external beam radiotherapy  (24). Standard NCRT covers the internal iliac, 
perirectal lymph nodes, mesorectum, and primary tumor  (25). Current  radiation portals 
are derived largely from Gunderson and Sosin’s detailed study of the pattern of 
J1360 CORRECT  
Protocol Chair:  Amol Narang, M.D.   
Version 7.[ADDRESS_59329] shown  that the m ajority of pelvic 
failures occur locally in the anastomosis and presacral tumor bed and that the incidence 
of extramesorectal pelvic nodal failure is low both in overall incidence as well as an 
isolated source of failure  (4, 26 -28). Wiig, reporting on 100 cases of local recurrence 
after TME, concluded that all recurrences were within reach of the examining finger and 
at the tumor bed  (26). In the same series, there was only one case of nodal recurrence in 
the lateral pelvic wall. In the Dutch TME referenced  above, the rate of extramesorectal 
pelvic nodal failure was 1.6% in the TME alone arm versus 1.3% who received 
preoperative radiation therapy. Moreover, preoperative treatment of extramesorectal 
nodes with chemoradiation may not improve outcomes. In the M ERCURY study, MRI -
based assessment of tumor regression and circumferential margin were prognostic for 
survival after neoadjuvant chemoradiation  (29). Importantly, the presence of MRI 
detected extramesorectal lymphadenopathy did negatively impact disease -free survival; 
however, the use of neoadjuvant treatment did not alter the negative outcomes of iliac 
node positivity (29).  
3.[ADDRESS_59330] -based 
criteria (30). We will exploit this hypothesis by [CONTACT_54935] 18F-FDG uptake in 192Ir HDR brachytherapy  of rectal 
cancer at the voxel level as well as for the whole tumor. This strategy exploits 
another emerging concept that a single mean absorbed dose value is rarely indicative 
of tumor response.  
 
The following sequence of events will take place (the firs t four are patient procedures 
and the last is a theoretical exercise): 1) an initial 18F -FDG PET/CT scan ( Figure 
1a); 2) [ADDRESS_59331] 192Ir brachytherapy designed to deliver a minimum of 26 
Gy total to every voxel of the defined tumor region ( Figure  1b); 3) a second 18F-FDG 
PET scan 8 weeks after treatment ( Figure 1c); 4) resection of the tumor; 5) a 
comparison of pathologic tumor response with radiation dose distributions.  
 
Consequently, the correlations we will be examining will be twofold: 1) the entire 
tumor and 2) the individual voxels. The whole tumor mean dose will be compared to 
the change in 18F-FDG uptake in the tumor region both in absolute and in relative 
J1360 CORRECT

10 
 change. A similar approach holds for the voxelized data; however, voxelized data 
represents a challenge in dosimetry: the uncertainty inherent in the individual voxel 
absorbed dose outweighs its value. However, when large number of voxels are 
considered, such as those that constitute an entire organ or a binned ensemble, 
significant result s can be obtained. This is often exploited in the form of dose volume 
histograms (DVHs). We will use both DVHs and binned results in our analyses.  
 
3.2.[ADDRESS_59332].  
To do this, we will examine well -described genetic alterations (VEGF/EFGR, p53, 
BRAF, KR AS, PIK3CA, γ -H2AX, and XRCC1).   We will determine whether 
particular mutations predict for pCR rates status post treatment.  We will also 
correlate our findings with overall and disease -free survival.

3.2.[ADDRESS_59334] since the colon is colonized with ~1012-13 commensal bacteria with 
the potential to induce inflammatory processes if colonic epi[INVESTIGATOR_54897]. The importance of inflammation in CRC is demonstrated by [CONTACT_54936] (IBD). 
Bacterial initiators and promoters of immunologically driven CRC have long been 
proposed. Supportive human epi[INVESTIGATOR_54898]. Over time, the 
inves tigative focus has been on either mutagen production by [CONTACT_54937] -damaging molecules. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_54899], no direct links between the metabolic activities of bacteria and 
sporadic CRC a re established. To date, the strongest, yet limited, evidence suggesting 
that commensal microbiota contribute to CRC pathogenesis derive from select, 
usually immune, gene knockout murine models in which the incidence of colon 
tumors usually decreases under  germ -free conditions. The idea that the microbiome 
structure confers disease potential is supported by [CONTACT_33653], for example, indicating that 
murine colitis or disease phenotypes are transmissible through the microbiome. In 
2011, we initiated a project at Joh ns Hopkins in which primary, untreated CRC 
tumors along with flanking normal colon tissue from surgical specimens was 
J1360 CORRECT

Version 7.0  May 19, 2020

 collected for microbial analysis. Microbial analysis included structural microbiology, 
classic anaerobic microbiology and deep sequencing of the tumor or normal tissue 
(mucosal) -associated microbiota. This project has yielded, to date a critical 
observations. In right CRCs examined to date, a marked biofilm is associated with 
the tumors and is also present on at least 40% of flanking normal tissues from the 
same patients. In contrast, no biofilms are detected on any left CRC tumors or on 
flanking normal colon tissues. These data suggest the microbial associations of right 
vs. left -sided CRC are distinct. Sequencing analyses have revealed tren ds to 
differences in specific microbial associations in right and left CRC. Left sided CRC 
analyzed to date have been from the descending and rectosigmoid region because 
most rectal cancer at JHH is treated before surgery with radiation and chemotherapy, 
both of which may modulate the microbiome, we have little information on microbial 
associations of rectal cancer. In conjunction with the endorectal brachytherapy trial 
for treatment of rectal cancer, we will collect 2 additional biopsies (tumor and 
normal)  during the pre -treatment endoscopy (standard of care in current protocol). 
Biopsies are currently being collected for other correlative studies during this 
endoscopy and additional biopsies will not be taken if it interferes with patient care. 
Tissue will  be snap frozen and used for microbial sequencing. Results will be 
analyzed in conjunction with ongoing CRC microbial studies (evaluations of right 
and left colon cancer) underway at JHH as well as correlative studies (tumor 
genetics) being conducted as pa rt of the endorectal brachytherapy trial.  
 
3.3 Preliminary Data  
In order to accurately quantify the effects of a) dose rate and b) heterogeneity in the 
normal organs and tumors and consequently the relative merits and potential of HDR 
brachytherapy as an adju nct for rectal cancer treatment, we will use dose volume 
histograms (DVHs) for all sensitive normal organs as well as the tumors and compare the 
DVHs to the DVHs from the IMRT treatment plans (performed on patient diagnostic 
scans). In order to compare dos e values from different modalities, brachytherapy and 
IMRT external beam therapy, a conversion based on radiobiological modeling and the 
linear -quadratic equation is used. The different voxel doses are converted to the 
biological effective dose (BED)  (41, 42) and from there to equivalent 180 -cGy fractions  
(43) used in the IMRT plan.  
The formula for the biological equivalent dose (BED) is:
 



//1NDD BED  
where D is the total absorbed dose, N is the number of fractions ([ADDRESS_59335] 
brachytherapy; 2 8 for the IMRT plan) and alpha and beta are the radiobiological 
parameters for the linear -quadratic model of cell kill.  
 
The process of conversion to [ADDRESS_59336]. Accurate, detailed absorbed dose calculations are useful only to the extent 
that they are biologically relevant and easily interpretable. The uniformity (or lack 
thereof) of absorbed dose distributions and their biological implications has been 
examined intensively, primarily in animal st udies  (44-46). The equivalent uniform dose 
J1360 CORRECT

Version 7.0  May 19, 2020

 (EUD) model converts the spatially varying absorbed dose distribution into an equivalent 
uniform absorbed dose value that would yield a biological response similar to the one 
expected from the original dose distri bution. This provides a single value that may be 
used to compare different dose distributions  (43, 47, 48 ) and  may correlate to single 
tumor response values rather than the mean absorbed dose. This EUD value is another 
example of how voxelized data may be grouped to provide more biologically relevant 
information at a larger scale.

extensive ulceration (solid arrows) is apparent after Endo -HDR (a), while the mucosa remains intact 
(solid arrows) after conve ntional CRT (f). Hyalinization of the lamina propria (asterisks) is also 
evident after Endo -HDR (a). Second Row – In the submucosa, marked hypertrophy and sclerosis of 
vessel walls can be seen following Endo -HDR (b), while only slight hypertrophy of vessel  walls is 
seen after conventional CRT (g). Third Row – Within the muscularis propria, the more superficial 
interna layer can be seen to exhibit degeneration and atrophy after Endo -HDR while the externa layer 
remains largely intact (c); in a contrary fashio n, following conventional CRT, it is the externa layer 
that exhibits more prominent degeneration compared to the interna (h). Fourth Row – At the level of

using a high dose -rate remote after -loading system. Standard radiation procedures 
will be followed during Endo -HDR as outlined in the protocol. QO L will be assessed 
throughout the treatment process (see calendar). Endoscopic endorectal ultrasound 
(EUS) is obtained for tumor staging and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the 
pelvis is used for tumor measurements (length and bulk evaluation).

Plexiglas plate with the mounted hydraulic locking clamp is slid under th e patient’s 
pelvis and the Oncosmart intracavitary mold is latched onto the hydraulic locking 
clamp. Repeated AP and lateral scout views are then taken and examined. When 
necessary, adjustments are made to the cephalic  orientations of the applicator relati ve 
to the radio -opaque marker  locations. The tip of the applicator will be positioned at 
least [ADDRESS_59356], the acquired images are sent a 
dedicated virtual simulation image processing workstation. Contoured tumor, 
catheters a nd endorectal marker s are incorporated into digitally reconstructed 
radiographs (DRRs) or digitally composite radiographs (DCRs) to enhance 
selectively visualization and use as references for daily treatment.

The tumor volume is defined as the (gross tumor volume=GTV).   The GTV plus 
additional intramesorectal extension is defined as the clinical target volume=CTV)

volume is the vol ume confined to within 5 mm of the perimeter of the balloon that 
did not extend beyond 1 cm of the superior and inferior margins of the target.   When 
a balloon is not used, the normal rectum volume will be confined to the normal 
rectum (non -CTV) within 5 m m of the applicator.   The percentage of the CTV 
covered by 100% and 150% of Dref (V100 and V150), and the minimum dose 
received by 90% of the CTV (D90) will be calculated. The mean dose (Dmean) to 
normal tissues, inclusive of bladder, femoral heads, bone m arrow, uterus, vagina,

histogram. Bone marrow will be defined by [CONTACT_54942] L4/L5 interspace through the sacrum, pelvis, and proximal femurs to th e inferior 
aspect of the inferior pubic rami. The other normal structures will be defined in 
accordance with the RTOG male and female atlas guidelines (see Section 7.2.9).   In 
addition, the minimum dose to the hotest 1, 2, and 5 cm3 (D1cc, D2cc, and D5cc) of 
the normal structures will be calculated to examine anatomic heterogeneity effects. 
The doses are expressed as a percentage of Dref.   We will confirm that 100% of the 
CTV volume is covered by [CONTACT_941] 95% isodose line. Any visible perirectal lymph nodes 
seen on imaging will be included in the treatment volume however other mesorectal 
lymph nodes are not always included as it is assumed these will be removed by [CONTACT_54943].   As a general rule, any lymph node deposits located within 0.5 and 1 cm from 
the target CTV  will receive 75% and 50% of the prescribed dose.   Endorectal 
markers as well as the first dwell position are incorporated into digitally 
reconstructed radiographs for use as a reference for the daily treatments. The digitally 
reconstructed radiographs wil l be created with the reconstruction plane set at the 
level of the applicator so that the ruler can be used for distance measurements 
between radio -opaque markers and the first dwell position of the applicator.   Dwell 
positions are determined with respect to the extent of the contoured target. Catheters 
are loaded in a differential manner so that only those in close proximity with the 
tumor contain active source dwell positions. After the source position determination, 
CT-aided brachytherapy treatment plann ing is carried out to fully conform the dose 
distribution to the target, and to limit dose as much as possible to immediately 
adjacent tissues beyond the rectal wall.

Version 7.[ADDRESS_59359] always be treated in rectal cancer 
and will be uniformly expanded by 0.5 cm to create PTV -Initial.  This volume will 
receive 45 Gy (1.8 Gy x 25).  
  
 Superior border: The recommended superior extent of the peri -rectal component 
of CTVA was at whichever is more cephalad: the rectosigmoid junction or 2 cm 
proximal to the superior extent of macroscopic disea se in the rectum/peri -rectal 
nodes.  This defines how much of the distal large bowel should be within CTVA.  
The most cephalad extent of CTVA will be higher than the peri -rectal 
component, in order to properly cover the internal iliac and pre -sacral region s.  
The most cephalad aspect of CTVA should be where the common iliac vessels 
bifurcate into external/internal iliacs (approximate boney landmark: sacral 
promontory).  
 
 Inferior border: Minimum 2 cm caudal to gross disease including coverage of 
entire mesor ectum to the pelvic floor. Unless radiographic evidence of extension 
to ischiorectal fossa, CTVA need not extend through the levator muscles. For 
very advanced anal or rectal cancers, extending through the mesorectum or the 
levators, the group’s recommenda tion is to add ~1 -2 cm margin up to bone 
wherever the cancer extends beyond the usual compartments.  An MRI and/or 
PET/CT scan is strongly recommended in such cases.  
  
CTVA will also include the following structures:  
o Iliac Lymphatic CTV= Internal iliac v essels + 1.0 cm symmetrical 
expansion.  
o Presacral Lymphatic CTV = 8mm anterior to anterior border of sacral 
bone (extending from S1 -S5) 
o Mesorectal and perirectal lymphatic CTV  
o Posterior border: anterior border of the sacrum and gluteus maximus  
o Lateral bord er: Ileum, pi[INVESTIGATOR_54907]

7.4.1 Patient Assessment  
After the patient has been identified as a candidate for the trial, the surgeon will 
assess the patient and will determine:  
1. Exact height and location of tumor wit h regards to the anal margin as 
measured by a rigid or flexible p roctoscope and/or digital exam.  
2. Mobility of tumor as assessed if possible by [CONTACT_54946]  
3. Type of surgical procedure: Abdomino -perineal resection vs. sphincter 
saving procedures, which will include colo -anal with mucosectomy vs. 
stapled anastomosis.

the future site of either temporary ileostomy or permanent colostomy.  Bowel 
preparation, perioperative antibiotics, and venothromboembolic prophylaxis will be 
encouraged and administered at the discretion of the treating facilities.  Skin 
preparation, glucose monitoring, and temperature regulation will be at the discretion 
of the treating surgeon and facility.  
7.4.3 Tumor Assessment  
The following items will be assessed at the time of surgery either before the 
procedure begins or once the specimen has been removed.  
1. Macroscopic response to brachytherapy (complete vs. partial vs. n on 
response)  
2. Height between tumor bed and anal margin, to assess feasibility of either 
colo-anal anastomosis vs. stapled anastomosis vs. abdomino -perineal 
resection (APR).  
3. Location of the tumor on the bowel wall (anterior/posterior).  
 
The pathologist shou ld be orientated to the position of the tumor and should open the  
lumen of the specimen so that the response can be directly observed. We follow the 
criteria outlined by [CONTACT_54947]. with tumor regression grade (TRG) 1 -2

expected that all attempts to perform a high ligation of the IMA will occur and that 
the nodes within this portion of the mesentery will be carefully exam ined.  The plane 
between the fascia propria of the rectum and the presacral fascia will be entered in 
the midline posteriorly.  Every attempt will be made to identify the hypogastric 
nerves along the pelvic side wall and the findings will be recorded as in jured or 
preserved ( See Appendix  VI). It is expected that all tumors located in the mid and 
lower rectum will be removed with a complete TME.  All attempts will be made to

10.1 Central Imaging Review and Determining Response  
Initial imaging including rectal protocol MRI and FDG -PET/CT scan will be performed 
within 6 weeks of initiating RT.  At 4-8 weeks following RT repeat MR imaging with 
DWI and C E-MR and FDG -PET/CT will be performed. Scans will be assessed using 
criteria outlined in the Mercury study. PERCIST and RECIST will be centrally 
determined on PET/CT and MRI images as outlined in Appendix VII at the completion of 
the study . We will integra te FDG -PET/CT into Endo -HDR treatment planning to improve 
our ability to accurately delineate tumor boundaries. We will co -register FDG -PET 
images with the MRI planning scan using the CT component of the PET/CT. To control 
for the effects of PET window/lev el, we will contour the tumor boundary at a threshold of 
40% of the maximum SUV value as validated in previous studies. We have previously 
shown that FDG -PET/CT is an important investigative tool in the initial evaluation of 
primary rectal cancer and that it can accurately predict response to NCRT  (53).  Our 
initial data demonstrated that PET/CT is more accurate at initial staging of rectal cancer 
than conventional CT imaging.  More recently, we have shown that FDG -PET/CT is an 
effective method of monitorin g the response of tumors to NCRT  (54).  Serial FDG -
PET/CT scans demonstrated that changes in the visual response score (VRS) and SUV 
were able to predict tumor downstaging on final pathology. To better evaluate tumor 
response, a newer method to examine the  relation between dose and response as 
measured by 18F-FDG uptake in 192Ir HDR brachytherapy and IMRT treated rectal cancer 
will be utilized at the voxel level as well as for the whole tumor. Furthermore,  newer 
modalities in MR may provide additional infor mation to assess tumor response.  
Specifically, functional MR imaging can essentially provide in vivo physiologic and 
metabolic information via spectroscopy, diffusion, and perfusion techniques  (55). 
Functional MRI has been evaluated at our institution in the management of metastatic 
colorectal disease to the liver  (56). Data regarding the use of functional MRI in the 
assessment of response in adenocarcinoma of the rectum is limited; however, the ability 
to perform physiologic evaluation of tumors may help predict for pCR following Endo -
HDR and IMRT.

 Nearly Complete (#2)  
Moderate bulk to the meso rectum. Irregularity of the mesorectal surface with 
defects greater than 5mm but none extending to the muscularis propria. No 
areas of visibility of the muscularis propria except at the insertion site of the 
levator ani muscles.  
 Complete (#3)  
Intact bulky mesorectum with a smooth surface. Only minor irregularities of 
the mesorectal surface. No surface defects greater than 5 mm in depth. No 
coning towards the distal margin of the specimen. (After transverse 
sectioning – smooth circumferential margin)  
10.[ADDRESS_59382] recently completed a 
phase II multi -institutional (University of Michigan and Johns Hopkins Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) 
study evaluating QOL in patients receiving conventional neoadjuvant 5 -FU based 
CRT as measured by [CONTACT_20368] -C30, QLQ -CR38 and CR29 instruments  (59, 
60). The frequency and severity of disease - and treatment -related symptoms before, 
during, and following CRT were obtained. Eligible patients included rectal cancer 
patients who received NCRT (45 -54 Gy) using a standard 3 -field technique. The 
results of this study (N=50) were presented at the ASCO/ASTRO GI 2011 meeting 
and the manuscript was recently published  (Herman et al. 201 3).  During NCRT, 
patients had a statistically and clinically significant decline in global QOL, which 
normalized following completion of NCRT. During NCRT, patients also experienced 
a significant increase in GI sympt oms (21 to 27, p=0.028), urinary symptoms (16 to 
30, p < 0.0001), male sexual dysfunction (23 to 34, p=0.013), and chemotherapy 
related side effects (8 to 20, p = 0.0001). Interestingly, while these measures returned 
to baseline [ADDRESS_59383]

 through prospective (pre/post) short and long term ( 5 years) QOL assessment with 
validated questionnaires.  The EORTC QLQ -CR38 is an internationally validated, 
colorectal cancer -specific  quality of life index, and the EORTC QLQ -30 is an 
internationally validated questionnaire assessing general quality of life.  Patients will 
be asked to complete both of these assessments.  
10.3.2  Stress Evaluation  
Cancer treatments can cause significant stress for cancer patients  (61) because they 
lead to physical and psychological side effects and disruptions in daily life and social 
activities. Stress levels tend to differ according to the stage in trea tment for cancer 
patients, with the highest levels occurring around diagnosis and treatment, and often 
declining over time  (62). Presumably, cancer treatments could have differing effects 
on patients’ stress levels and impact in their daily life depending on the severity of 
side effects and their length of course. Comparisons between Endo -HDR, the newer 
radiation therapy under examination in the current trial, and 5 -FU (Cap) + RT on their 
impact on patients’ stress levels have not been conducted. By [CONTACT_54950] g the dose and 
length of treatment, it is hypothesized that Endo -HDR may be perceived as less 
stressful and having less of a negative impact on daily life compared with 5 -FU (Cap) 
+ RT. To compare the trajectory of patient stress i n the two treatment condi tions, 
study patients will complete [ADDRESS_59384] on daily life, which were 
developed for this study or assessed previously in colorectal cancer studies  (63), and 
the Perceived Stress Scale  (64), a widely used [ADDRESS_59385] month.  
10.3.3  Sexual Function  
Increasing research finds that long -term sexual function is impacted by [CONTACT_54951]  (65, 66). In a prior research study by [CONTACT_2296]  (67), 
we examined changes in patient -repor ted QOL during and after neoadjuvant 
chemoradiation in [ADDRESS_59386], comprehensive sexual function 
measures  (68, 69), the Female Sexual Function Index  (70) and the International Index 
of Erectile Function  (71) at all study time points.  In addition, because use of 
therapeutic aids (e.g., phosphodieterase inhibitors such as Viagra, vaginal lubricants) 
can impact self -reported sexual function, we will assess patients’ use of therapeutic 
aids through [ADDRESS_59387] month (4 for women; 4 
for men). These  items are selected from the Therapeutic Aids domain of the PROMIS 
Sexual Function and Satisfaction measure, which has been extensively validated in 
cancer populations  (72).

treatment, whether or not considered causally related to the treatment. An undesirable 
medical condition may be symptoms (headache, nausea), signs (tachycardia, enlarged 
liver), or abnormal results of an investigation (MRI , laboratory finding).  
11.2.2  Serious adverse event (SAE)  
A serious adverse event is an undesirable sign, symptom, or medical condition 
which:  
 Results in death.  
 Is immediately life threatening.  
 Requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_54913]  
 Is a congenital abnormality or birth defect  
 Unexpected event that cause harm or place person at a greater risk of 
harm than was previously known or recognized, and which was possibly 
related to the research. Unexpected means that the event was n ot 
described in the consent form or the event exceeded the expected severity.  
 Is an important medical event that may jeopardize the patient or may 
require medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.

11.2.3  Expectedness  
 Expected: Expected adverse events are those that have been previously 
identified as r esulting from administration of the agent. For the purposes of this 
study, an adverse event is considered expected when it appears in the current 
adverse event list, the Investigator’s Brochure, the package insert or is included 
in the informed consent doc ument as a potential risk.  
 Unexpected: An adverse event is considered unexpected when it varies in 
nature, intensity or frequency from information provided in the current adverse 
event list, the Investigator’s Brochure, the package insert or when it is not  
included in the informed consent document as a potential risk  
11.2.4  Attribution  
Attribution is the relationship between an adverse event or serious adverse event and 
the study treatment. Attribution will be assigned as follows:  
 Not Related: The adverse event i s clearly related to other factors such as the 
subject’s clinical state, environmental factors, or other modes of therapy or 
concomitant drugs administered to the subject.  
 Not likely: There is a temporal relationship to investigational product 
administrati on, but there is not a reasonable causal relationship between the 
investigational product and the AE.  
 Possible: The adverse event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the study drug, and/or follows a known response pattern to 
the study drug, but could readily have been produced by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical 
state, environmental factors, or other modes of therapy or concomitant drugs 
administered to the subject.  
 Probable: The adverse event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the study drug and follows a known response pattern to the 
study drug, and cannot readily have been produced by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical 
state, environmental factors, or other modes of therapy or concomitant drugs 
administered to the subject.  
 Definite: There is a reasonable causal relationship between the investigational 
product and the AE. The event responds to withdrawal of investigational 
product (dechallenge), and recurs with rechallenge when clinically feasible.

treating physician will be counseling them on the risk of their treatments, including the 
risk of surgery, radiation ther apy, and/or chemotherapy, whichever is appropriate for the 
type and the stage of their cancer.  
 
Phlebotomy can cause pain, bleeding, and rare needle site infection. PET imaging results 
in low dose radiation exposure, which has an extremely small risk of c ausing a secondary 
cancer.  
11.4 Endoscopy & Marker Implantation  
The use of endoscopy to initially assess and follow -up rectal cancer following 
neoadjuvant treatment is routine.  For the purposes of this study it is necessary prior to 
therapy to place endoscopi c markers to mark the tumor for guidance to place the 
endoluminal catheter.  The risk of flexible sigmoidoscopy and marker  placement are 
minimal and include bleeding in less than 1 in 100 patients and perforation in less than 1 
in 1,000 patients.  Generall y, this procedure is done without sedation but sedation will be 
provided if the patient requests the use of it.  The risks of sedation include heart 
arrhythmias, hypotension, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1506], and confusion.  All endoscopic procedures 
are performed in a monitored setting with a nurse to minimize this risk.  
11.5 Endorectal Brachytherapy Radiation Therapy  
 Rectal bleeding:  The risk of minimal bleeding after catheter placement is common 
and nearly all patients will have bleeding from their tumor.  The risk of major 
bleeding from this procedure is similar to endoscopic evaluation and is <1%.  
 Rectal perforation:  This risk of perforation from insertion of the endoluminal probe 
is less than 1% and is similar to endoscopic procedure.  The catheter is placed using 
direct image guidance.  
 Rectal discomfort:  Rectal discomfort from the application of the brachy probe will be 
common to all patients.  To minimize the risk of this, routine endoscopic assessment 
of rectal luminal size prior to port placement will be perform ed and local anesthetic 
gel will be used if necessary.                                                                   
 Poor catheter placement with inadequate treatment dose administration:  All patients 
prior to treatment will have endoscopic radiopaque  markers placed to outline the 
tumor to guide in catheter placement.  All patients prior to HDRBT treatment will 
undergo simulation planning to assure full tumor treatment.  The catheter is guided 
intraluminally using real time imaging (C -arm CT scan).

11.6 Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy  
All radiation related adverse events will be recorded on the local toxicity case report 
forms.   Neoadjvuant intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and capecitabine 
chemotherapy is considered standa rd of care treatment for localized rectal cancer.

possible side effects include small bowel obstruction, fistula, small bowel ulceration, wet 
desquamation, infection, and urethral obstruction.”  
 
The following are common potential short term reactions/ risks that are associated with  
external beam radiation therapy:  
Increased urinary frequency, urgency, pain, mild to moderate increase in frequency and  
looseness of bowel movements, fatigue, diarrhea, decreased blood cell count, temporary

of allergic reaction.  
11.9  Risks of Blood Draws  
About 8ml (1 ½ teaspoon s) of blood may be drawn before radiation, after radiation, 
before surgery , and during follow -up for research purposes. Whenever  possible, these 
samples will be obtai ned at the sa me time as other  routi ne laboratory studies.  Although 
trained phleboto mists will be obtaining the blood sa mples, there are minimal risks 
associated with this procedure.  Taking blood may cause so me discomfort, bleeding, or 
bruising where the needle enters the body, and there is a s mall risk of inf ection.  In rare 
cases, blood draw ing may result in fainting.

14. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
14.1 Endpoints  
14.1.1  Study Design  
This is a multi -institutional, randomized, two -arm, phase II trial of endorectal 
brachyt herapy alone (Endo -HDR) versus intensity modulated external beam 
radiotherapy  (IMRT) or 3 -D conformal radiation therapy with capectitabine in 
patients with stage II/III rectal distal adenocarcinoma. Patients enrolled in the study 
will be randomized (2:1 r atio) to either Endo -HDR or standard external beam 
chemoradiation.  
 
14.2 Sample Size/Accrual Rate  
14.2.[ADDRESS_59401] approximate ly 20% of candidates will 
drop out because of unexpected findings on PET/CT (i .e. metastases) or MRI (i .e. 
iliac/inguinal lymph nodes). Therefore, we expect to randomize 138 patients  in 2:1 
ratio into two treatment arms ([ADDRESS_59402] arm and 46 in th e control arm).   
Using a one -sided Fisher’s exact test at significance level 0.1, we will have 80% 
power to detect a 17% increase of pathologic complete response rate from the 13% in 
the control treatment arm to 30% pCR in the Endo -HDR arm. After randomiza tion, 
we expect <5% drop -out rate.  
 
One interim analysis for early assessment of futility  is planned after 69 patients (half 
of the total planned sample size) have had their pCR evaluation. The trial will be 
terminated early if the ratio of the pCR rate in  the Endo -HDR arm vs. control arm is [ADDRESS_59403]  
Protocol Chair:  Amol Narang, M.D.   
Version 7.0  May 19, 2020  
 
 
52 
 14.3 Early Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_54917] 69 pati ents (half of 
the total planned sample size) have had their pCR evaluation. The trial will be 
terminated early if the pCR rate in the Endo -HDR arm is less than the control group 
(standard chemoradiation).  If the pCR rate is the same or better with endorec tal 
brachytherapy, the trial will continue. This leads to minimal loss of power compared to 
an analysis without an intermediate look.  
14.4 Analysis of Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoint is pathologic complete response rate, which will be estimated for 
both a rms as the proportion of patients who achieve pathologic complete response after 
the treatment. The corresponding 95% confidence intervals will be calculated. The 
comparison of pCR between the two arms will be performed using Chi-square  test. The 
primary a nalysis of the pCR endpoint will be based on the intent -to-treat population 
which includes all randomized patients where patients are classified according to the 
randomized treatment assignment regardless of what treatment was received.  
14.5 Analysis of Seconda ry Endpoints  
Secondary endpoints of this phase II trial include toxicity, quality of life, locoregional 
control/distant metastasis, overall survival, and correlative analyses of biomarkers and 
functional imaging changes.  
 
The acute and chronic toxicity and  adverse events will be summarized in frequency 
tables by [CONTACT_54958]’s 
exact tests.  
 
Qualify of life will be assessed via EORTC QLQ -C30 (v3.0) questionnaires as 
mentioned above. Scoring will b e based on procedures outlined by [CONTACT_51222]. For our 
study population of rectal cancer patients, the analysis will be focused on general and 
colorectal model regarding urinary/bowel toxicity , sphincter function , and sexual 
dysfunction . For each module, sum mary statistics of the scores will be reported at 
baseline and each follow -up time. After confirming that there are no baseline differences 
in quality of life across the two treatment arms using independent samples t -test, 
changes in quality of life scores  from  pre- to post-treatment will be computed, and the  
difference between these change scores  will be evaluated by [CONTACT_54959] -sample t -tests. We 
will compare the quality of life scores  at each endpoint  as well as the differences  
between the two arms using two -sample t -test. Given the plurality of comparisons, p -
values <0.[ADDRESS_59404]  
Protocol Chair:  Amol Narang, M.D.   
Version 7.[ADDRESS_59405] 
will be used for the comparison.  
 
The analysis of correlative endpoints of imaging and biomarkers will be exploratory.   
 
For all patie nts in both study arms, the presence of VEGF/EGFR status will be assessed 
using pre -treatment tumor biopsies prior to the start of radiation therapy. The result will 
be expressed as a binary variable indicating the presence of expression 
(positive/negative ). Its association with pCR will be assessed using Fisher’s exact test. 
We will also examine the role of VEGF/EGFR and other hypoxia related biomarkers as 
a predictive marker for tumor response following Endo -HDR treatment by [CONTACT_54960]/EGFR status using a logistic regression 
model where pCR is the dependent variable.  
 
For those treated with Endo -HDR, we anticipate the pCR rate to be 40% among patients 
with favorable VEGF/EGFR and/or hypoxia marker signature [CONTACT_54978] 10% pCR in 
the group with unfavorable signature. If we observe 40% patients with unfavorable 
profile, with [ADDRESS_59406] 89% power.

To assess the correlation of functio nal PET/MR and treatment response, we will 
compare the change of SUV pre - and post -treatment between responders and non -
responders using a two -sample t -test. Non -parametric Wilcoxon test will be considered 
when the data are not normally distributed. For a binary response outcome, the 
predictive ability of the PET/MR marker will be evaluated using an ROC curve based on

Adverse Event Reporting  
 
 Definition of Adverse Event (AE)  
An adverse event is the development of an undesirable medical condition or the 
deterioration of a pre -existing medical condition following or during exposure to a 
pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered causally related to the product.  An 
undesirable medical condition can be symptoms (e.g., nausea, chest pain), signs (e.g., 
tachycardia, enlarged liver) or the abnormal res ults of an investigation (e.g., laboratory 
findings, electrocardiogram).  In clinical trials, from the time of signing an informed 
J1360 CORRECT  
Protocol Chair:  Amol Narang, M.D.   
Version 7.0  May 19, 2020  
 
 
64 
 consent, an AE can include an undesirable medical condition occurring at any time, 
including run -in or washout periods, even if no trial treatment has been administered.  
 
Definition of Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
A serious adverse event is an AE occurring during any trial phase (i.e., run -in, treatment, 
washout, follow -up), and at any dose of the investigational product, compara tor or 
placebo, that fulfills one or more of the following criteria:  
 Results in death  
 Is immediately life -threatening  
 Requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
 Results in persistent or significant disability or incapac ity 
 Is a congenital abnormality or birth defect  
 Is an important medical event that may jeopardize the patient or may require 
medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above  
 
Protocol Chair  
The Protocol Chair is ultimately responsible for t he required reporting of all adverse 
events.  
 
Coordinating Center  
The Coordinating Center is the central location for the collection and maintenance of 
documentation of adverse events and is responsible for submitting adverse event reports 
to the Protocol Chair promptly.  The Coordinating Center will maintain documentation of 
all adverse event reports for each participating site.  Adverse event reports submitted to 
the Coordinating Center must be signed and dated by [CONTACT_16529]’s Principal 
Invest igator.  The Coordinating Center will provide appropriate forms to be used by [CONTACT_54970].  Information to be provided must include:  
 Subject ID number, and initials  
 Date of the event  
 Description of the event  
 Descrip tion of site's response to the event  
 Assessment of the subject's condition  
 Subject's status on the study (on study, off study, etc.)  
 Attribution of event to study drug  
 
Participating Sites  
Participating sites are responsible for reporting adverse events to  their IRB according to 
its specific requirements and to the Coordinating Center as follows:  
 
Fatal Events  whether anticipated or unanticipated, and whether or not related to the 
study must be reported to the Coordinating Center within 24 hours  of the 
participating site Principal Investigator's learning of the event.  
 
J1360 CORRECT  
Protocol Chair:  Amol Narang, M.D.   
Version 7.[ADDRESS_59434] be reported to 
the Coordinating Center within 24 hours  of the participating site Principal 
Investigator's learning of the event.  
 
Other Serious Adverse Events  which may result in a change to the protocol, 
informed consent, or risk to subjects as specified in the protocol must be reported 
within three (3) working days  of the participating site Principal Investigator's 
learning of th e event.  
 
Adverse Events which result in no change to protocol, informed consent, or risk to 
subjects must be reported to the Coordinating Center on a monthly basis.  
 
Adverse event reports are to be faxed to the Coordinating Center at [PHONE_974] . 
Follo w-up reports are faxed, mailed, or sent electronically to the Coordinating Center 
as necessary.  
 
The investigator must also report follow -up information about SAEs within the same 
time frames.  
 
If a non -serious AE becomes serious, this and other relevant f ollow -up information 
must also be provided within the same time frames described above.  
 
All SAEs must be collected whether or not they are considered causally related to the 
investigational product.  Investigators and other site personnel are responsible for 
reporting all casually related SAEs to their IRB and the Protocol Chair.

 APPENDIX VII: Imaging Techniques/Central Image Review  
 
MRI Imaging Guidelines  
 
1) All imaging will be electronically trans ferred according to the IRAT guidelines.  See 
appendix for specific information.   All MRS and MRI sequences will be performed on the 
same scanner when possible (3.0T field strength) to ensure high repeatability and minimal 
variability between MR scans. Ded icated research MR technicians will be trained specifically for 
our protocol and MR parameters will be standardized for this study to minimize variability 
further.   During the course of the trial, a quality assurance phantom will be scanned bi -weekly to 
ensure that the MR unit is functioning properly for the acquisition of reproducible data.   An MRI 
will be performed before and [ADDRESS_59462].   T2-weighted images, diffusion -
weighted images, dynamic perfusion images and subtracted dynamic images will be interpreted 
side by [CONTACT_54973]. For diffusion weighted imaging the apparent 
diffusion coefficient values (ADC) will be calculated from the low and high b -value images 
according to the formula; ADC = [ln (Sh/Sl)]/(bh -bl), where Sh and Sl are signal intensities in 
the region/volume of interest obtained with low and high b values, respectively.   
  
At baseline and [ADDRESS_59463] we will perform a subjective local tumor and 
nodal staging.   A confidence level scor ing system will be used for T -staging and nodal 
morphology, and heterogenicity will be used for N -staging. The confidence levels will be set at: 
tumor definitely absent (complete intact muscular layer)=CR, probably absent (partial disruption 
of the muscula r layer without extension of tumor beyond the contour of the rectal wall), probably 
present (complete disruption of the muscular rectal wall with mild bulging tumor margin) and 
definitely present (complete disruption of the muscular rectal wall with tumor invasion of the 
perirectal fat). Tumors will be classified as T1 when they are confined to the submucosa, T2 
when it invades, but does not penetrate the muscularis propria, T3 when it penetrates the 
muscularis propria and T4 when it invades adjacent organs  including the pelvic wall or visceral 
peritoneum.   For nodal status, morphology and heterogenicity will be used for differentiating 
malignant and non -malignant lymph nodes (LN).   Nodes with a smooth, well -defined margin and 
homogeneous intensity will be g rouped as nonmalignant LN. Nodes with an irregular or 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_54928], indistinct margin and mottled heterogeneous intensity will be grouped as 
malignant LN. The TNM classification system will be used for nodal staging as follows: N0, no 
malignant nodes ; N1, 1 -3 malignant nodes; or N2, >[ADDRESS_59464] are being analyzed at each time point.  Further 
imaging of the participant will be at the di scretion of the treating physician.  
  
2) As part of the MRI acquisition and to gain data from the use of functional aspects of the MRI, 
the tumor will be segmented on dynamic perfusion images to create a volume of interest. 
J1360 CORRECT  
Protocol Chair:  Amol Narang, M.D.   
Version 7.[ADDRESS_59465] will be analyzed on 
all sequences to provide the various multiparametric MR measurements (e.g. ADC, % 
perfusion).  
  
3) Spectral data will be processed on a dedicated workstation, aligned with the corresponding 
MR i mages by [CONTACT_54974] -shifting and baseline phase -correcting tools available with the point -
resolved spectroscopy sequence package and archived as an array of spectral data (including 
automated estimates of the choline plus creatine -to-citrate ratio and the  choline -to-creatine ratio) 
with the corresponding MR images in Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine format. 
Peak area ratios will be calculated by [CONTACT_54975] a fixed 
frequency range defined in a peak file co ntaining peak positions and widths. With use of an MR 
spectroscopic imaging overlay sheet and pre -established criteria for the probability of 
malignancy based on the choline plus creatine -to-citrate ratio and the choline -to-creatine ratio, 
the location and  size of areas suspi[INVESTIGATOR_54929] -treatment assessment.  Spectral data will be obtained  from 
Johns Hopkins patients only.  
  
PET-CT Imaging Guidelines  
 
Participants will undergo a FDG -PET/CT (diagnostic CT) before and [ADDRESS_59466] will be required prior to the 
examination , although water intake is allowed. A blood glucose level will be checked in patients, 
and the study will not be performed if the blood glucose exceeds 150 mg/dL. Participants are 
initially injected with [ADDRESS_59467] lacking glucose with a 13% barium concentration. Imaging will take place in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_54930] - PET/CT system 
(GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI, or similar machi nes at participating subsites). 
Simultaneous diagnostic IV/oral contrast CT images will be obtained generally at [ADDRESS_59468] rotation, with a pi[INVESTIGATOR_22347] 6 and a table speed of 22.5 mm/second.

  1 OVERVIEW  
Congenital heart diseases (CHD) are the most common birth defects, occurring in nearly 1% of live births. 
Every year, an estimated 40,000 infants born in the U.S. suffer from CHD. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_80526], CHD requiring neonatal surgery is associated with poor outcomes; national registry data 
demonstrates post -operative major morbidity in 23% and 10% do not survive to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]. [1-4]  
Poor outcomes after pediatric heart surgery are often attributable to a severe systemic inflammatory 
response to cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_6476] (CPB). [5-8]  CPB is necessary for most infant  CHD surgeries. 
Theref ore, to reduce the post -CPB inflammatory reaction, many surgeons administer pre -or intra -
operative steroids. [9-15] Steroids have been shown to reduce inflammatory markers after neonatal heart 
surgery. [13, 16]  However, steroids also have potential harmful effects including an increased risk of post -
operative infection. [17] The recent SIRS trial evaluated the safety and efficacy of steroids after CPB in 
adults and demonstrated no beneficial effect of steroids but increased risk of post -CPB myocardial 
infarction and other major adverse events. [18, 19]   
Adult trial results cannot be reliably e xtrapolated to infants  because the neonatal response to CPB is 
markedly different to that seen in adults; infants  demonstrate both a more pronounced inflammatory 
reaction and a different post -operative complication profile. For these reasons approximately 60%  of 
congenital heart surgeons continue to administer perioperative steroids to infants  undergoing heart 
surgery. [17] Yet this practice is not evidence based as no safety/efficacy trial has ever evaluated steroi ds 
in infants  undergoing heart surgery with CPB. Several smaller steroid trials (all enrolling < 75 patients) 
have focused on surrogate outcome measures, but none have provided conclusive data. [16, 20]   
The major barrier to performing a steroid trial in infants  with CHD has been the high cost associated with 
trial conduct for these relatively rare defects. To overcome this barrier, we will use a novel approach 
leveraging existing registry infrastructure at CHD surg ical sites that participate in the Society of Thoracic 
Surgeons Congenital Heart Surgery Database (STS -CHSD).  Sites participating in the STS-CHSD collect 
data into their institutional databases using standardized case report forms (see Appendix A) so that  the 
data can be exported to the STS -CHSD. These sites already employ data coordinating specialists to 
capture patient demographics, procedural variables, and post -operative outcomes (including a list of over 
60 complication variables) using strict and consistent data element definitions. By [CONTACT_80570]-
specific resources we project that we can reduce trial costs by >75%.

2 PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
Protocol Title  STeroids to RE duce Systemic inflammation after infant heart Surgery 
(STRESS trial) 
US IND Number  [ADDRESS_87891] Intravenous methylprednisolone  
Objectives:  To determine the pharmacokinetics (PK)/pharmacodynamics (PD), safety and efficacy of 
methylprednisolone in infants undergoing planned heart surgery with cardio pulmonary 
by[CONTACT_80571]:  This is a prospective, double blind, multi -center, placebo -controlled safety and efficacy 
study. Blood samples will be collected from a subset of enrolled study participants to 
evaluate single  dose methylprednisolone PK/PD.  After informed consent is obtained, 
participants will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to intravenous methylprednisolone versus placebo. Study drug/placebo will be administered in the operating room at the time of initiation of cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_6476]. Patie nts will be followed for primary and secondary 
outcomes for the duration of their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] .    Serious study drug-related adverse 
events will be collected for 7 days after the administration of study drug .  
Rationale for study design  The study desi gn will allow for evaluation of safety and efficacy to neonates receiving the 
drug. The proposed design will also allow for characterization of single  dose 
methylprednisolone PK/PD.

Estimated Start: September  2017  
Estimated Finish: August  2021  
Primary endpoints  Primary efficacy and safety outcome measures will be compared between infants  receiving 
any methylprednisolone and placebo.  
 
Primary endpoint - efficacy:  
The primary outcome measure will consist of a composite mortality, major morbidity and 
length of stay global rank endpoint with endpoints ranked according to  severity.    
For this endpoint each randomized patient recieving study drug will be assigned a rank 
based upon their most -severe outcome.  
Secondary endpoints Efficacy:  
• Mortality including in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_80528] [ADDRESS_87894] dose of study drug  
• Death or major complication as defined by [CONTACT_80574] [ADDRESS_87895] 
global ranking categories   
• Post-operative hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577] 
• Prevalence of prolonged (> 7 days) post -operative mechanical ventilation  
• Occurrence of post -operative low cardiac output syndrome  
Safety:  
• Occurence of any  one or more of the following major post -operative infectious 
complications: 
o Postprocedural infective endocarditis  
o Pneumonia 
o Sepsis  
o Deep wound infection 
o Mediastinitis  
• Other post -operative complications will be collected from the start of study drug 
adminis tration until hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345].  
PK/PD /Biomarkers: 
• Time to maximum concentration (T max) 
• Maximum concentration (C max) 
• Clearance (CL)  
• Volume of distribution (Vd)  
• Post-operative blood markers of inflammation  
STRESS Trial Protocol    Version 6.0  
 [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
 
  Page 7 of 96 
 
  PK/PD /Biomarkers: Blood samples will be obtained  from patients at various time points after the study drug 
infusion. PK parameters will be estimated by [CONTACT_105] -compartmental analysis using 
WinNonLin software.  Study participants as well as enrolling centers will be given the 
opportunity to not participate in the PK/PD and/or Biomarker studies as these require 
needle sticks.  Therefore it is expected that PK/PD and/or biomarker data will not be 
collected on every participant enrolled in the STRESS trial  
Criteria for 
evaluation  Safety/Efficacy:  Safety and ef ficacy data will be collected at participating sites using their 
existing surgical databases (STS-CHSD) . The majority of efficacy and safety outcomes 
represent data elements that sites are currently collecting for submission to the STS -CHSD. 
A separate cli nical database will be used for expedited reporting of any study drug -related 
serious adverse events. An independent Data Monitoring Board (DMC) will monitor the 
conduct of the trial for performance (e.g., recruitment, flow and quality control of data, 
adherence to the protocol) and patient safety. The DMC may review the data at any time. 
At any time and for any reason, the DMC may recommend to the sponsor that the trial be interrupted or discontinued.  
Pharmacokinetics:   
 Methylprednisolone concentrations wi ll be measured in plasma. 
Samples will be measured at a central lab using a validated bioanalytical assay.  
Statistical 
Consideration:  This protocol has sufficient enrollment to evaluate PK/PD, safety and efficacy of IV 
methylprednisolone  
 
3 BACKGROUND INF ORMATION  
3.1 Summary of Experience in the Perioperative Setting in Children with CHD  
Some surgeons/centers currently administer perioperative high dose (20mg to 60mg) intravenous methylprednisolone before pediatric  heart surgery with CPB.  In a national regist ry study of > 3000 
neonates with data capture spanning 2004 to 2008, 62% of neonates undergoing surgery with CPB 
received perioperative methylprednisolone while 38% did not.  Of those receiving methylprednisolone, 
22% received methylprednisolone on both the day before, and day of surgery, 12% on the day before surgery only, and 28% on the day of surgery only. In a 2
nd national registry study including > 25,000 
infants undergoing CPB operations (2003-2008), 57% received perioperative corticosteroids while 43% did not.[21] Results of a survey of surgeons from the Congenital Heart Surgeon’s Society were similar; 28% did not routinely use steroids for neonatal heart surgery.  Of the 72% that did routinely use steroids, 
~1/3rd administered steroids pre -operativel y and intra -operatively and the remainder gave intra -operative 
steroids only. [22] 
 
Several previous small translationally focused clinical trials have evaluated the safety and efficacy of methylprednisolone.  In the largest contemporary trial, neonates scheduled for cardiac surgery were 
prospectively randomized to receive either 2 -dose (8 hours preoperatively and operatively, n = 39) or 
single -dose (operatively, n = 37) methylprednisolone at 30 mg/kg IV per dose in a prospective double -
blind trial. Neonates receiving pre -operative methylprednisolone therapy demonstrated significantly 
reduced pre -operative pro-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin -[ADDRESS_87896] -operative low cardiac output  syndrome. [13, 14]  Methylprednisolone was well tolerated 
with no adverse drug reactions.  The overall incidence of post -operative infection was 13% (10/76) and 
4% (3/76) received a post -operative insulin infusion for hyperglycemia.  
 
STRESS Trial Protocol    Version 6.0  
 [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
 
  Page 8 of 96 
 
  A meta -analysis evaluated six previous steroid trials in children undergoing heart surgery with CPB. The 
combined enrollment of these six trials was 232 participants including 116 receiving peri -operative 
steroids; two of these studies used methylprednisolone at doses of 30mg/kg IV per dose (n=67 patients). 
The results of this meta-analysis demonstrated a nonsignificant trend of reduced mortality in steroid -
treated patients (11 [4.7%] vs 4 [1.7%] patients; odds ratio, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.14 –1.15; p = 0.089). Steroids 
had no effects on mechanical ventilation time (117.4 ± 95.9 hr vs 137.3 ± 102.4 hr; p = 0.43) and ICU 
length of stay (9.6 ± 4.6 d vs 9.9 ± 5.9 d; p = 0.8). Perioperative steroid administration reduced the 
prevalence of renal dy sfunction (13 [54.2%] vs 2 [8%] patients; odds ratio, 0.07; 95% CI, 0.01– 0.38; p = 
0.002). There were no significant differences in the adverse event profiles for patients receiving steroids 
versus placebo. [20]  
 The conclusions of the aforementioned studies, as well as several associated editorials have all been that a 
large, randomized, controlled trial is needed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of perioperative steroids 
for infant  heart surgery with CPB. [13, 14, 16, 20]  
 
4 TRIAL DESIGN AND METHODS  
4.1 Overview  
This study is a prospective, double -blind, multi-center, placebo -controlled safety and efficacy study of  
methylprednisolone in infants  undergoing planned heart surgery with CPB.  The study will enroll up to 
1500 infants  (< 1 year  of age)  including a minimum of 400 neonates ≤  30 days at the time of surgery.  
The total study duration is expected to be approximately 48 months.  An ancillary PK/PD /Biomarker  
study will enr oll subjects at select centers. This study is unique in that it is designed to leverage existing 
registry infrastructure at participating sites so as to reduce trial costs.  Participants will be randomized and will receive a subject ID.  This ID will also serve as a unique patient identifier allowing us to crosslink 
datasets.  Participants will then receive study drug/placebo  administered into the pump prime during 
cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_6476].  All study participants will then receive routine post -operative care.  
Participating centers will enter all demographic, preoperative, operative and outcomes data into their 
existing institutional databases for submission to the  STS-CHSD as they currently do . These data will be 
used to evaluate trial outcomes.   
 
4.2 Procedures to Minimize/Avoid Bias  
4.2.1 Randomization  
 
Eligible participants will be randomized prior to their electively scheduled surgery in a 1:1 fashion to the treatment groups summarized in table 2 below.  A block randomization scheme will be employed to 
ensure equal  allocation by [CONTACT_3885]. Randomization assignments will be generated by a web -based 
system at the data coordinating center (DCC), after confirmation of trial eligibility. Trial sites will enter 
the randomization number into two  databases that will be used for this trial (see section 6.4):  the 
participating center’s surgical database (for submission to the STS- CHSD) , and an IBM Clinical 
Development  database that will be used to capture some adverse event data, timing of drug delivery and 
timing of PK samp les (for participating centers only) and a  subset of laboratory values from the electronic 
health record.

4.3 Study measures  
Study outcomes were determined after trial simulations. Based upon these data we selected the followi ng 
primary and secondary outcome measures.  
 
4.3.1 Primary Endpoint  
 A composite mortality, major morbidity and length of stay global rank endpoint with endpoints ranked 
according to  severity. The global rank score has been previously described. [23]  Subjects will receive a 
rank score based upon the lowest ranking (worst) endpoint that they experience during the study trial.

Safety:  
• Occuren ce of any one or more of the following STS -CHSD -defined major post -operative 
infectious complications: 
o Postprocedural infective endocarditis  
o Pneumonia

PK/PD /Biomarkers: 
• Time to maximum concentration (T max) 
• Maximum concentration (C max)

• Volume of distribution (Vd)  
• Post-operative blood markers of inflammation 
PK/PD and Biom arker data will only be collected at select centers and in those patients whose 
parent/legally authorized representative have granted consent to blood draws.  An opt in/out clause is 
included in the informed consent forms for study participants and centers  will be allowed to 
participate in this part of the study if they prefer.  Parent/legally authorized representative of participants may elect to participate in the PK/PD, the Biomarker studies or both.  Time points for blood collection will be the same for  both the PK/PD and biomarker studies. Biomarkers being 
collected represent blood markers of inflammation.

through 7 days after administration of study drug. Based upon an 18 hour estimated half - life of 
methylprednisolone, this duration of follow up (> 10 half -lives) will ensure collection of all potentially 
study drug-related serious adverse events but avoids capturing unnecessary serious adverse events in this 
high morbidity patient population.  
 
4.4 Schedule of events  
Participants will be enrolled at the time of their electively scheduled surgery.  Sites will receive a 
randomization ID that will be entered into the two  relevant databases:  t he sites’ surgical database (STS-

  CHSD) , and an IBM Clinical Development  clinical database.  The study drug/placebo will be 
administered in the CPB pump prime at the time of initiation of CPB.  Participants will then undergo 
surgery with CPB per standard of care.  Participants will receive routine post -operative care. Post -
operative outcomes including post -operative hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577], discharge mortality , and 
complication data will be recorded in the sites institutional surgical database (STS -CHSD) consistent with 
current practices at the enrolling sites.  STS -CHSD data element definitions of particular relevance to the 
STRESS trial are included in Section 11.2. A subset of additional safety endpoints and select safety 
laboratory values from the electronic health record will be collected into a separate clinical database, IBM 
Clinical Development (see section 6.4). Plasma samples including PK/PD/Biomarker  samples will be 
evaluated in a subset of enrolled patients at select centers using a limited sampling scheme. Sample

7 TREATMENTS TO BE ADM INISTERED  
7.1 Description of Study Treatments  
Eligible subjects will be randomized prior to their electively scheduled surgery in a 1:1 fashion to methylprednisolone (30mg/kg)  versus placebo as summarized in table 2 above. The dosages for 
administration (30 mg/kg)  are based upon expert consensus regarding current practice  and a previous 
dosing study . Intravenous methylprednisolone is available in a p reservative free single use “ Act-O-Vial

  System” containing powder (40mg, 125mg, 500mg and 1000mg options are available) and diluent.  Study 
drug will be provided “off the shelf” by [CONTACT_80577].   
Only preservative -free solutions will be used for this trial due to safety concerns with the administration 
of benzyl alcohol preservatives in infants . Study drug will be mixed with isotonic saline in a syringe to 
create a solution.  P lacebo preparations will consist o f isotonic saline only and will be prepared in 
identical syringes so as to be physically indistinguishable from study drug.  
 
7.2 Route of Administration  
For the purposes of this trial methylprednisolone will be administered as a bolus dose administered directl y into the CPB priming solution (intraoperative administration).  
 
7.3 Storage and Administration  
Study drug/placebo will be prepared by [CONTACT_80578]/placebo  administration.  All co -
investigators, staff administering study drug /placebo  and other care providers will be blinded to study 
drug/placebo  allocation. Start and stop times of study drug administration must be documented by [CONTACT_80579] l pharmacy in the IBM Clinical Development  database.

  9 SAFETY ASSESSMENTS A ND MONITORING  
9.1 Collection and Reporting  
Due to the unique study design, adverse events will be recorded by [CONTACT_80580]/or other 
adverse event data variables specifically captured by [CONTACT_779]’ s surgical database using STS -CHSD data 
element definitions (see Section 11.2).   
 
Serious, study drug-related adverse events will be reported by [CONTACT_80581] [ADDRESS_87919] becoming aware of the 
event . The site investigator’s reported relationship assessment to st udy drug will be confirmed or assessed 
otherwise by a Safety Medical Monitor at the Duke Clinical Research Institute.  
 
9.2 Definitions of Adverse Events (AEs), Suspected Adverse Reaction and 
Serious Adverse Events 
The FDA Final Rule on IND Safety Reporting Requirements 
[http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2010/pdf/2010- [ZIP_CODE].pdf] provides the following definitions:  
 Adverse events (AEs)  An AE is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in a 
subject whether or not considered drug- or biologi c-related. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product or biologic.  
 A suspected adverse reaction (SAR)  is any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that 
the drug caused the adverse event. A “reasonable possibility” suggests there is a causal relationship 
between the drug and the adverse event. “Suspected adverse reaction” implies a lesser degree of certainty 
about causality than adverse r eaction , which means any adverse event caused by a drug.  
 Serious adverse events: An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered serious if, in the 
view of either the site investigator or the IND sponsor, it results in any of the following o utcomes:  
 
1. Death  
2. Life-threatening AE: Places the subject at immediate risk of death at the time of the event as it 
occurred. It does not include an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
3. Persistent or significant incapacit y or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life 
functions  
4. Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_80534], be life threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_45790] a serious adverse event when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, it may 
jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed in the definition above. This determination is based o n the opi[INVESTIGATOR_80535] (e.g., if either believes it is serious, it must be considered serious).  
 
STRESS Trial Protocol    Version 6.0  
 [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
 
  Page [ADDRESS_87920] -operative complication that sites report to the STS-
CHSD.  In this case, the clinical diagnosis rather than the laboratory term will be used by [CONTACT_80582] (e.g., renal failure versus elevated creatinine).  
 
9.3 Assessm ent of Severity  
The determination of severity rests on medical judgment of a medically qualified investigator. For adverse events captured by [CONTACT_779]’ s surgical database, the data monitoring committee will review these 
events every 6 -months following transfer of data to the data coordinating center at the Duke Clinical 
Research Institute.  For suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions, monitoring will be performed 
continuously and event severity will be graded by [CONTACT_4530].  The severity of suspected adverse reactions and study drug related SAEs will be graded using the following definitions : 
 
1.    MILD: Participant is aware of symptoms or has minor findings but tolerates them well and no or 
minimal intervention required.  
2.    MODERATE: Participant experiences discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activity 
and may warrant intervention.  
3.    SEVERE: Participant experiences symptoms that are incapacitating with inability to do usual 
activities or that significantly affect clinical status and warrant intervention.  
 Study personnel will enter the study drug -related serious adverse event data into the IBM Clinical 
Development  database. The STRESS Trial PI / IND sponsor will be responsible for adjudicating severity 
and relatedness of these events and determining which events should be reported in expedited fashion to FDA.  The IND sponsor or designee will submit expedited safety reports (IND Safety Reports) to the FDA 
and other regulatory agencies as necessary, and will inform the investigators of such regulatory reports. Investigators must submit safety reports as required by [CONTACT_65231] (IRB). 
Documentation of the submission to and receipt by [CONTACT_80583].  
 
9.[ADDRESS_87921] assess the relationship of any adverse event to the use of the 
study drug, based on available information using the following guidelines:  
 
1.    Not related : There is not a reasonable causal relatio nship to the investigational product and the 
adverse event.  
2.    Unlikely related:  No temporal association, or the cause of the event has been identified, or the drug 
or biologic cannot be implicated.  
3.    Possibly related : There is reasonable evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and 
adverse event.  
4.    Related : There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and the influence of other factors is 
unlikely.  
Relatedness to these complications will not be specifically assigned by [CONTACT_80584] (S[LOCATION_003]Rs).   
Expectedness 
The expectedness of an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction shall be assessed by a DCRI Safety 
Medical Mo nitor according to the package insert. Any AE that is not identified in nature, severity, or 
specificity in the current package insert is considered unexpected. Events that are not mentioned in the 
STRESS Trial Protocol    Version 6.0  
 [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
 
  Page [ADDRESS_87922] pre -existin g medical conditions and will be currently hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], 
those pre -existing conditions will not be considered as adverse events unless they worsen or increase in 
frequency or intensity after administration of study drug. New events that occur or the worsen ing in 
frequency or intensity of pre -existing conditions will be reported as adverse events or, if serious reporting 
criteria are met, serious adverse events. Events that do not qualify as a study drug-related serious adverse 
event for  the STRESS trial and  should not be recorded in the IBM Clinical Development clinical database 
are: 
• Medical or surgical procedures (e.g. surgery, transfusion); however, the condition that required the procedure is considered an adverse event if the situation developed or worse ned due to study 
drug administration 
• Pre-existing diseases or baseline conditions present or detected before the start of study drug that 
do not worsen in frequency or intensity due to study drug administration.  
• Any events considered to be related to the p atients underlying heart disease or recovery from 
his/her cardiac surgery, including any of the post -operative complications listed in the STS-
CHSD.  
• Serious Adverse Events that are assessed by [CONTACT_80585] 
 
9.6 Safety Monitoring  
The data coordinating center (DCC) will monitor safety during the conduct of the study. The study 
sponsor will review all potential unexpected study drug related serious adverse events at the time of SAE 
notification by [CONTACT_80586] a suspected unexpected 
serious adverse reaction  (S[LOCATION_003]R) . The data monitoring committee (DMC) will monitor safety every [ADDRESS_87923] an internal review of study safety every 6 -months 
of study enrollme nt.  The safety review will include all SAEs and all AEs captured in either the STS-
CHSD or the separate IBM Clinical Development  clinical database that the data monitoring committee 
determine are possibly or probably related to the study drug and all pati ents who discontinued 
participation in the study early. If >3 subjects experience active  (not placebo) study drug -related  SAEs 
of the same Preferred Term (MedDRA coding), the DMC will be notified.  Decisions to halt the trial will 
be at the discretion of t he DMC.  
 If the study is halted, the AEs will be thoroughly evaluated and study enrollment will not resume until the 
safety review is completed.

10 STATISTICS  
10.1 Planned Sample Size  
The trial's sample size was formulated to provide high power (>90%) for detecting a clinically important treatment benefit in patients randomized to steroids versus placebo as measured by [CONTACT_20767]'s primary 
global ranking endpoint categories with testing based on the Wilcoxon rank sum test or, equivalently, the proportional odds logistic regression model score test [24] . The magnitude of the hypothesized treatment 
effect of steroids versus placebo was quantified by [CONTACT_80588] a randomly selected patient in the steroids group will have a better outcome (higher global ranking 
category) than a randomly selected patient in the placebo group and 
  is the probabil ity that a randomly 
selected patient in the steroids group will have a worse outcome (lower global ranking category) than a 
randomly selected patient the placebo group. As shown in Table 6, a sample size of approximately 1,200 
particip ants will provide approximately 85% power if the win difference is 
  and will provide 95%  
power if the win difference is 0.12. Thus, the study has good power to detect a meaningful improvement 
in the probability of a better outcome with steroids compared t o placebo. For an alternative perspective on 
the study's power, the treatment effect of steroids versus placebo may be quantified by [CONTACT_80589] (worst) global ranking categories is 
reduced in patients randomized to steroids versus placebo, where 
  refers to the odds of death, 
  
refers to the odds of death or heart transplant, etc.  Specifically, the treatment effect may be quantified by 
[CONTACT_80590] 
 . As shown in Table 6, a sample 
size of 1,200 participants will provide approximate 82% power if the odds ratio is 0.75 (i.e. a 25% 
STRESS Trial Protocol    Version 6.0  
 [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
 
  Page 20 of 96 
 
  reduction in the odds) and approximately 95% power if the odds ratio is 0.70 (i.e. a 30% reduction in the 
odds). Thus, the study is well powered under a range of clinically relevant and plausible risk reduction 
scenarios. For simplicity, power statements above are based on approximate power using a Wilcoxon test ignoring baseline covariates. However, to increase statistical power, analysis of the primary endpoint will 
be adjusted for baseline covariates, as described in Section 10.3 below. Based on Monte Carlo simulations, 
a covariate adjusted analysis will increase power by [CONTACT_80591] 3 to 5 percent age points 
compared to an unadjusted analysis under assumptions consistent with 80% -90% power for the 
unadjusted analysis.

quantity 
  reflects the reduction in variance due to ties and was set  to its maximum possible value 
(
 ) in order to obtain a conservative lower bound approximation of power  for a specified win 
difference. Calculations do not account for an expected slight loss of power after decreasing alpha to 
account for interim analyses.   
 
10.2 Statistical Analysis Plan  
All major treatment comparisons between the randomized groups will be performed according to 
the principle of "intention- to-treat"; that is, subjects who received study drug/placebo will be 
analyzed (and endpoints attributed) a ccording to the group to which subjects were randomized, 
regardless of subsequent medications or treatment crossover. Statistical comparisons will be performed using 2-sided significance tests.  
 
10.3 Analysis of the Primary Endpoint  
The trial's global ranking endpoint outcome is an ordinal categorical variable having 
  levels, where 
category [ADDRESS_87925] possible outcome (e.g. death) and category 
  represents the best possible 
outcome (e.g. a short hospi[INVESTIGATOR_80536]) according to a pre -specified 
subjective global  ranking algorithm (see above). Table [ADDRESS_87926] (also known as the van Elteren test [27]) with stratification by 
[CONTACT_80593]-randomizati on predicted mortality or morbidity risk or by [CONTACT_2329] a regression- based 
analog of the van Elteren test which allows adjusting for multiple pre -randomization prognostic factors in 
order to maximize statistical power [28] . Covariates for stratification or covariate adjustment will be 
determined prospectively and will be pre -specified in the statistical analysis plan. The level of 
STRESS Trial Protocol    Version 6.0  
 [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
 
  Page 21 of 96 
 
  significance for the assessment of the primary endpoint will be α=0.05 (two-sided). The magnitude of the 
treatment effect will be described by [CONTACT_80594] a randomly selected steroids 
group parti cipant will have a better or worse outcome than a randomly selected placebo group participant 
(e.g. the win ratio [29] ). If the data provide evidence of an overall difference in outcome between 
treatment groups, we will further examine whether the therapeutic effect is similar for all participants, or 
whether it varies according to specific participant characteristics, which will be pre-specified in the 
statistical analysis plan. These analyses will use ordinal reg ression models and will involve testing for 
interactions between treatment and these specific baseline variables. Effect estimates for subgroups will 
be carefully (conservatively) interpreted in conjunction with the formal interaction tests.

10.4 Analysis of Secondary Safety and Efficacy Endpoints  
Secondary endpoints will be analyzed via regression modeling with adjustm ent for pre -
randomization covariates. For secondary endpoints that are binary (e.g. mortality, composite 
mortality or major complications, low cardiac output syndrome), the form of the model will be a 
logistic regression comparing the endpoint event rate a cross the two treatment groups. For 
continuous outcomes with skewed distributions (e.g., post -operative hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577], 
duration of mechanical ventilation) the outcome will be approximated by a skewed distribution such as log -normal, Weibull or ne gative binomial , or modeled semi -parametrically . For safety 
analyses, we will summarize the number of adverse events overall, by [CONTACT_926], and by [CONTACT_80595]. We will 
tabulate adverse event data by [CONTACT_80596] (STAT levels).  
 
10.5 Interim Analyses  
Interim examination of clinical endpoints and key safety events will be performed at regular intervals during the course of the trial. An independent Data Monitoring Committee  (DMC) will 
monitor participant safety and review performance of the trial. The primary objective of these 
interim analyses will be to ensure the safety of the participants enrolled in the trial and evaluate 
the accumulating endpoint data by [CONTACT_80597] 6.0  
 [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
 
  Page [ADDRESS_87927] ing of the 
accumulating data, the group sequential method of Lan and DeMets will be used as a guide for 
interpreting these interim analyses.  Monitoring boundaries for the primary endpoint will be based on a 
two-sided symmetric O’Brien -Fleming type spending function with an overall two-sided significance 
level of α = 0.05. The O’Brien -Fleming approach requires large critical values early in the study but 
relaxes (i.e., decreases) the critical value as the trial progresses. These proposed monitoring boundari es 
are intended as a guide for interpreting the interim analyses and not as a strict rule for early termination. The first interim analysis using alpha spending will be targeted to occur after completion of data 
collection for the first ~[ADDRESS_87928] . Additional 
interim analyses will be performed at intervals determined by [CONTACT_1363] . Study enrollment will be allowed 
to continue pending compi[INVESTIGATOR_80539]/recommendations from the DMC . 
 
Update 15 September 2020 : Due to a delay in receiving the STS -CHSD data harvest, the DMC Chair is 
agreeable to proceed with the interim analysis in the following manner.  The un blinded  statistical team 
will plan to access and compi[INVESTIGATOR_80540] (LOS) and mortality data by [CONTACT_80598].  This data will be reviewed by [CONTACT_80599] a convened DMC meeting.  If these data suggest any safety concerns, the study team will proceed with the previously  
planned interim analysis whenever the STS -CHSD data are available. If there are no identified safety 
concerns then enrollment will continue to trial completion.
 
10.6 Data Monitoring Committee  
A DMC  will be appointed by [CONTACT_20767]'s leadership to monitor participant safety and to review 
performance of the trial. A DMC  charter that outlines the operating guidelines for the committee 
and the procedures for the interim evaluations of study data will be developed by [CONTACT_20767]'s leadership and agreed upon by [CONTACT_941] D MC. Reports will be prepared regularly in accordance with 
the plan outlined in the charter and as requested by [CONTACT_941] D MC chair, and will include interim 
analyses of primary and secondary endpoints; additional safety events; and other information as requested by [CONTACT_942]. After each meeting, the DMC  will make recommendations to the 
trial's leadership about the continuation of the study. After approval by [CONTACT_80600], a summary of the DMC  report and recommendations will be forwarded to site investigators for 
submission to their local IRB.  
 
10.7 Population for Analysis 
• Efficacy: All participants who receive study drug/placebo . 
• Safety:   All participants who receive study drug /placebo .  
• PK/PD /Biomarkers: All participants who receive methylprednisolone and have at least 
1 evaluable PK sample.

clinical trial ID” tab/variable.  This identifier must be entered into the STS database immediately after it is 
assigned. This identifier will be used to link the two  databases.   For other variables, the STS-CHSD 
includes specific data element definitions that must be closely followed (see section 11.2).  
 Serious, unexpected, study drug-related adverse events may require expedited reporting and 
therefore must be collected in an expedited fashion.  Since the STS-CHSD data are only harvested every [ADDRESS_87930] that are felt to 
be study drug-related (see section 9.2) and timing  of PK/PD /Biomarker  sample collection (for 
participating sites).  
 
In addition , a small subset of select post -operative laboratory administration variables (Table 4) need to 
be captured but are not incorporated into the STS -CHSD.  These data must be collect ed from the 
electronic health record and the data entered directly into the IBM Clinical Development database.   
 As summarized above, the IBM Clinical Development subject ID will be used to link the two  databases. 
As a safety control, sites will enter the STS "Operation ID” into the IBM Clinical Development database.  
In the event that the IBM Clinical Development subject ID is miss -entered into one of the databases, the 
STS Operation ID will be used to ensure accurate linkage.  
 
 
11.2 Data Element Definitions  
All STRESS data element definitions are based upon the STS-CHSD data element definitions which are 
available on -line at: 
http://www.sts.org/sites/default/files/documents/CongenitalDataSpecsV3_3_Updated.pdf .  Some specific 
definitions of particular relevance to the STRESS trial are listed below: 
 
Fundamental diagnosis:  The fundamental diagnosis is a diagnosis that is carried with a patient 
throughout life, through all operations and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]. The fundamental diagnosis is the most 
complex cardiac anomaly or condition (congenital or acquired) of the patient. Most frequently, the 
primary diagnosis will also be the fundamental diagnosis. For some operations, however, the fundamental 
diagnosis and primary diagnosis will be different. For example, consider a child who underwent repair of subaortic stenosis, subsequently develops complete atrioventricular (AV) block, and undergoes pacemaker placement within the same hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. The primary diagnosis for the pacemaker surgery is 
“Arrhythmia, Heart block, Acquired”, while the fundamental diagnosis is “Aortic stenosis, Subvalvar”. 
Similarly, a patient who has a complete AV canal defect and undergoes either palliation or repair of the defect has a primary and fundamental diagnosis of “AVC (AVSD), Complete CAVSD”. Subsequently, the child develops mitral insufficiency and is re-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_80541]. The primary 
STRESS Trial Protocol    Version 6.0  
 [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
 
  Page 24 of 96 
 
  diagnosis for the mitral valve replacement operation is “Mitral regurgitation”, but the fundamental 
diagnosis is “AVC (AVSD), Complete CAVSD.” The utilization of the fundamental diagnosis field, it is 
hoped, will clarify designation of a primary diagnosis, and enable greater specificity  in the lesion specific 
report analyses.  
 
STS-CHSD data element definitions for primary outcome measures:  
 
Death:  For the purposes of STRESS, we will use the following  definition of operative mortality which 
includes: (1) all deaths, regardless of cause, o ccurring during the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_80542], even if after 30 days (including patients transferred to other acute care facilities); and (2) 
all deaths, regardless of cause, occurring after discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], but befor e 30 days after 
administration of study drug/placebo.  
 
Heart transplantation: Includes any technique, allograft or xenograft. 
 Renal failure requiring permanent dialysis at discharge: Renal failure - acute renal failure (ROOT 
Definition) + with new postoperative/postprocedural requirement for dialysis, including peritoneal dialysis and/or hemodialysis. Code this complication if the patient requires dialysis at the time of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_80543]. (This complication should be chosen only if the dialysis was associated 
with acute renal failure.) {"Renal failure - acute renal failure" ROOT Definition = Acute renal failure is 
defined as new onset oliguria with sustained urine output < 0.5 cc/kg/hr for 24 hours and/or a rise in creatinine > 1.5 times upper limits of normal for age (or twice the most recent preoperative/preprocedural values if these are available), with eventual need for dialysis (including peritoneal dialysis and/or hemodialysis) or hemofiltration. Acute renal failure that will be counted as an operative or procedural 
complication must occur prior to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_80544] 30 days of the procedure. The complication is to be coded even if the patient required dialysis, but the treatment was not instituted due to patient or family refusal.  Neurological deficit persisting at discharge:  Newly recognized and/or newly acquired deficit of 
neurologic function leading to inpatient referral, therapy, or intervention not otherwise practiced for a similar  unaffected inpatient, with a persisting neurologic deficit present at hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]. In other 
words, new (onset intraoperatively or postoperatively – or intraprocedurally or postprocedurally) 
neurological deficit persisting and present at discharge f rom hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. 
 
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], requiring tracheostomy:  Failure to wean from mechanical ventilation necessitating 
the creation of a surgical airway.  
 
Renal failure requiring temporary dialysis : Acute renal failure (ROOT Definition) + With new 
postopera tive/postprocedural requirement for temporary dialysis, including peritoneal dialysis and/or 
hemodialysis. Code this complication if the patient does not require dialysis at the time of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_80543]. (This complication should be chosen only if the dialysis was associated 
with acute renal failure.) {"Renal failure – acute renal failure" ROOT Definition = Acute renal failure is 
defined as new onset oliguria with sustained urine output < 0.5 cc/kg/hr for 24 hours and/or a rise in

  Postoperative/Postprocedural mechanical circulatory support: Utilization of 
postoperative/postprocedural mechanical  support, of any type (IABP, VAD, ECMO, or CPS), for 
resuscitation/CPR or support, during the  
postoperative/postprocedural time period. Code this complication if it occurs (1) within 30 days after surgery or  
intervention regardless of the date of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345], or (2) after 30 days during the same 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_80545].  
 Unplanned cardiac operation during the postoperative or postprocedural time period, exclusive of reoperation for bleeding:  Any additional unplanned cardiac operation occurring (1) within 30 days after 
surgery or intervention in or out of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], or (2) after 30 days during the same hospi[INVESTIGATOR_80545]. A cardiac operation is defined as any operation that is of the operation type of "CPB" or "No CPB Cardiovascular". The following operations will always be coded as 
"Planned Reoperation": (1) Delayed Sternal Closure, (2) ECMO Decannulation, (3) VAD Decannulation, 
(4) Remov al of Broviac catheter. The following operations will always be coded as "Unplanned 
Reoperation": (1) Mediastinal exploration for infection, (2) Mediastinal exploration for hemodynamic instability, (3) Emergent mediastinal exploration for initiation of ECM O or VAD, (4) Reoperation for 
residual or recurrent lesion. Mediastinal exploration for bleeding is always coded separately as "Bleeding, 
Requiring reoperation".  
 
Reoperation for bleeding: Postoperative/postprocedural bleeding requiring reoperation.  
 Unpla nned non-cardiac reoperation: Any additional unplanned non-cardiac operation occurring (1) 
within 30 days after surgery or intervention in or out of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], or (2) after 30 days during the same 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_80546]. 
 
Unplanned interventional cardiovascular catheterization procedure: Any unplanned interventional cardiovascular catheterization  procedure occurring (1) within 30 days after surgery or  intervention in or 
out of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], or (2) after [ADDRESS_87931]:
 A cardiac arrest is the cessation of effective cardiac mechanical function. This 
complication should be selected if the cardiac arrest developed after OR Entry Date and  Time. Do not 
select this complication for patients under hospi[INVESTIGATOR_80547].  
 
Multi-System Organ Failure:  Note – this is the only complication variable where the STS -CHSD 
definition has been modified.  The current STS-CHSD definition is non-specific therefore we have 
developed the following definition for specific use during the STRESS trial.  
 
Multi-system Organ Failure requires two or more of the following to be present:  
 Neurologic dysfunction: any permanent or transient neurologic injury including clinical seizure  
 Renal dysfunction: serum creatinine > 2 times baseline or temporary or permanent dialysis 
 Hepatic dysfunction: AST or ALT > 2 times normal  
 GI dysfunction: Any surgical or medically treated epi[INVESTIGATOR_80548]  
 Respi[INVESTIGATOR_26517]: Mechanical ventilation > 7 days  
 
Please code the individual organ system failures as well. If multi -system organ failure is associated with 
sepsis as well, please also code: "Sepsis, Multisystem Organ Failure".

STS-CHSD data element definitions for infectious complications  
 
Pneumonia: A “respi[INVESTIGATOR_80549] (including 
alveolar spaces and interstitial tissue), most commonly caused by [CONTACT_80601]”. Pneumonia is diagnosed by [CONTACT_80602] (such as fever, leukopenia or leukocytosis, and new onset of purulent 
sputum) and one or more of the following: positive cultures (of sputum or pulmonary secretions) and / or 
pulmonary infiltrate on chest x -ray. An endotracheal tube culture may o r may not be positive. Patients 
commonly demonstrate an evolving area of focal lung consolidation accompanied by [CONTACT_411] (>38.5). 
Pneumonia (pneumonitis) may affect an entire lobe (lobar pneumonia), a segment of a lobe (segmental or lobular pneumonia), alveo li contiguous to bronchi (bronchopneumonia), or interstitial tissue (interstitial 
pneumonia). These distinctions are generally based on x -ray observations.  
 
Sepsis:  Evidence of serious infection accompanied by a deleterious systemic response. In the time period 
of the first 48 postoperative or postprocedural hours, the diagnosis of sepsis requires the presence of a 
Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) resulting from a proven infection (such as bacteremia, fungemia or urinary tract infection). In the time period after the first [ADDRESS_87932] 48 hours, a SIRS may result from the stress associated with surgery 
and/or cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_6476]. Thus, the clinical criteria for sepsis during this time period should be 
more stringent. A systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) is present when at least two of the following criteria are present: hypo- or hyperthermia  (>38.5 or <36.0), tachycardia or bradycardia, 
tachypnea, leukocytosis or leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia.  
Deep wound infection:  A deep wound infection involves the deep soft tissues (e.g., fascial and muscle 
layers) of the incision AND the patient has at  least ONE of the following numbered features: 1) Purulent 
drainage from the deep portion of the incision (but not from the organ / space component of the surgical site and no evidence of sternal osteomyelitis), 2) The deep incision spontaneously dehisces or is deliberately opened by a surgeon when the patient has ONE of the following lettered signs or symptoms (unless the incision is culture negative): A) fever, B) localized pain, or C) tenderness, 3) An abscess or 
other evidence of infection involving the  deep incision is found on direct examination, during reoperation, 
or by [CONTACT_80603], or 4) A diagnosis of a deep wound infection by a 
surgeon or by [CONTACT_80604].  
 Wound infection-Mediastinitis: The diagnosis of medi astinitis must meet one of the following criteria: 
Criterion 1: Patient has organisms cultured from mediastinal tissue or fluid that is obtained during a surgical operation or by [CONTACT_80605][INVESTIGATOR_1516]. Criterion 2: Patient has evidence of mediastinitis by [CONTACT_80606] a surgical operation. Criterion 
3: Patient has at least ONE of the following numbered signs or symptoms with no other recognized cause: 1) fever, 2) chest pain, or 3) sternal instability AND at least one of the following numbered features: 1) purulent mediastinal drainage, 2) organisms cultured from mediastinal blood, drainage or tissue, or 3) 
widening of the cardio- mediastinal silhouette. Criterion 4: Patient ≤ [ADDRESS_87933] one of the 
following numbered signs or symptoms with no other recognized cause: 1) fever, 2) hypothermia, 3) 
apnea, 4) bradycardia, or 5) sternal instability AND at least one of the following numbered features: 1) purulent mediastinal discharge, 2) organisms cultured from mediastinal blood, drainage or tissue, or 3) widening of the cardio- mediastinal silhouette. Infections of the sternum (sternal osteomyelitis) should be 
classified as mediastinitis. Sternal instability that is not associated with a wound  infection or mediastinitis 
is documented as "Sternal instability".

  Postprocedural infective endocarditis: Infective endocarditis in the setting of a heart which has been 
altered by [CONTACT_80607]. Duke Criteria for the Diagnosis of Infective Endocarditis (IE): The 
definitive diagnosis of infective endocarditis requires one of the following four situations: 1) Histologic 
and/or microbiologic evidence of infection at surgery or autopsy such as positive valve culture or histology; 2) Two major criteria; 3) One major criterion and three minor criteria; 4) Five minor criteria. The two major criteria are: 1) Blood cultures positive for IE 2) Evidence of endocardial involvement. Blood cultures positive for IE requires: 1) Typi[INVESTIGATOR_80550] 2 
separate blood cultures, as noted in number two below (viridans streptococci, Streptococcus bovis, Staphylococcus aureus, or HACEK group [HACEK, Haemophilus species {H. aprophilus and H. paraaphrophilus}, Actinobacillus actinoinyce temcomitans, Cardiobacterium hominis, Eikenella 
corrodens, and Kingella kingae.]) or (Community -acquired enterococci in the absence of a primary 
focus); 2) Microorganisms consistent with IE isolated from persistently positive blood cultures defined as: (At least 2 positive cultures of blood samples obtained > 12 hours apart) or (All of [ADDRESS_87934] sample obtained > 1 hr apart); 3) Single blood culture positive for Coxiella burnetii or an antiphase I IgG antibody titer of >1 :800. Evidence of endocardial involvement requires 1) Positive results of echocardiography for IE defined as: (Oscillating intracardiac mass on the valve or supporting structures in the path of regurgitant jets or on impl anted 
material in the absence of an alternative anatomic explanation) or (Abscess) or (New partial dehiscence of 
a valvular prosthesis) or 2) New valvular regurgitation (worsening or changing or preexisting murmur not 
sufficient). The six minor criteria ar e: 1) Predisposing heart disease or injection drug use (IVDA); 2) 
Temperature of > 38C; 3) Vascular phenomenon (major arterial emboli, septic pulmonary infarcts, mycotic aneurysm, intracranial or conjunctival hemorrhage, Janeway's lesions); 4) Immunologic phenomenon (glomerulonephritis, Osler's nodes, Roth's spots, rheumatoid factor); 5) Microbiologic evidence (a positive blood culture that does not meet a major criterion as noted above) or serologic 
evidence of active infection with an organism consistent with IE; 6) Echocardiographic findings that are 
consistent with IE but do not meet a major criterion as noted above. References: 1) Dhawan VK Infectious Endocarditis in Elderly Patients. Clin. Infect. Dis. 2002;34:806 - 812. 2) Durack DT, Lukes AS,

Cardiac dysfunction resulting in low cardiac output:  Low cardiac output state characterized by [CONTACT_80608]: tachycardia, oliguria, decreased skin perfusion, need for increased inotropic support (10% above b aseline at admission), metabolic acidosis, widened Arterial – Venous oxygen saturation, 
need to open the chest, or need for mechanical support. If the cardiac dysfunction is of a severity that results in inotrope dependence, mechanical circulatory support,  or listing for cardiac transplantation, 
please also code as "Cardiac failure (severe cardiac dysfunction)". A patient will be considered to have “inotrope dependence” if they cannot be weaned from inotropic support (10% above baseline at admission) after any period of 48 consecutive hours that occurs after the time of OR Exit Date and Time, and either (1) within 30 days after surgery in or out of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], and (2) after 30 days during the same hospi[INVESTIGATOR_80551].

  15.3 Appendix B : Package insert for intravenous methylprednisolone  
 
SOLU -MEDROL® (methylprednisolone sodium succinate for inje ction, USP )  
The formulations containing benzyl alcohol should not be used in neonates.  
For Intravenous or Intramuscular Administration  
  
DESCRIPTION  
SOLU -MEDROL Sterile Powder is an anti -inflammatory glucocorticoid, which contains 
methylprednisolone sodium succinate as the active ingredient. Methylprednisolone sodium succinate, 
USP, is the sodium succinate ester of methylprednisolone, and it occurs as a white, or nearly white, 
odorless hygroscopic, amorphous solid. It is very soluble in water and in alc ohol; it is insoluble in 
chloroform and is very slightly soluble in acetone.  
The chemical name [CONTACT_80639] -1,4-diene -3,20dione,21-(3-
carboxy -1-oxopropoxy)- 11,17-dihydroxy -6-methyl -monosodium salt, (6α, 11β), and the molecular 
weight is 496.53. The structural formula is represented below:  
 
Methylprednisolone sodium succinate is soluble in water; it may be administered in a small volume 
of diluent and is well suited for intravenous use in situations where high blood l evels of 
methylprednisolone are required rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375].

CLINICAL PHARMACOL OGY  
Glucocorticoids, naturally occurring and synthetic, are adrenocortical steroids that are readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.  
Naturally occurring glucocorticoids (hydrocortisone and cortisone), which also have salt -retaining 
properties, are used as replacement therapy in adrenocortical deficiency states. Their synthetic 
analogs are primarily used for their potent anti -inflammatory effects in disorders of many organ 
systems.  
Glucocorticoids cause profound and varied metabolic effects. In addition, they modify the body's 
immune responses to diverse stimuli.  
Methylprednisolone is a potent anti -inflammatory steroid with greater anti -inflammatory potency 
than prednisolone and even less tendency than prednisolone to induce sodium and water ret ention.  
Methylprednisolone sodium succinate has the same metabolic and anti -inflammatory actions as 
methylprednisolone. When given parenterally and in equimolar quantities, the two compounds are 
equivalent in biologic activity. Following the intravenous i njection of methylprednisolone sodium 
succinate, demonstrable effects are evident within one hour and persist for a variable period. Excretion of the administered dose is nearly complete within 12 hours. Thus, if constantly high blood 
levels are required, injections should be made every 4 to 6 hours. This preparation is also rapi[INVESTIGATOR_80553] a pattern similar to that observed 
after intravenous injection.

   Additional contraindication for the use of SOLU -MEDROL Sterile Powder preserved with 
benzyl alcohol:  
Formulations preserved with benzyl alcohol are contraindicated for use in premature infants. (See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS , Pediatric Use.  
WARNING S 
Serious Neurologic Adverse Reactions with Epi[INVESTIGATOR_80555], some resulting in death, have been reported with epi[INVESTIGATOR_80556]. Specific events reported include, but are not limited to, spi[INVESTIGATOR_80557], paraplegia, quadriplegia, cortical blindness, and stroke. These serious neurologic 
events have been reported with and without use of fluoroscopy. The safety and effectiveness of epi[INVESTIGATOR_80558], and corticosteroids are not 
approved for this use.  
 GENERAL  
Formulations with preservative (see DESCRIPTION) contain benzyl alcohol, which is potentially toxic when administered locally to neural tissue. Exposure to excessive amounts 
of benzyl alcohol has  been associated with toxicity (hypotension, metabolic acidosis), 
particularly in neonates, and an increased incidence of kernicterus, particularly in small preterm infants. There have been rare reports of deaths, primarily in preterm infants, associated w ith 
exposure to excessive amounts of benzyl alcohol. The amount of benzyl alcohol from medications is usually considered negligible compared to that received in flush solutions containing benzyl alcohol. Administration of high dosages of medications contai ning this 
preservative must take into account the total amount of benzyl alcohol administered. The amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known. If the patient requires more than the recommended dosages or other medications containing this preservative, the 
practitioner must consider the daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from these combined sources (see PRECAUTIONS , Pediatric Use ). 
 Injection of SOLU -MEDROL may result in dermal and/or subdermal changes forming 
depressions in the sk in at the injection site. In order to minimize the incidence of dermal and 
subdermal atrophy, care must be exercised not to exceed recommended doses in injections. Injection into the deltoid muscle should be avoided because of a high incidence of subcutane ous atrophy.  
 
Rare instances of anaphylactoid reactions have occurred in patients receiving corticosteroid therapy (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). 
 
Increased dosage of rapi[INVESTIGATOR_80559], during, and after the stressful 
situation.  
 
Results from one multicenter, randomized, placebo- controlled study with methylprednisolone 
hemisuccinate, an intravenous corticosteroid, showed an increase in early (at 2 weeks)  and late 
STRESS Trial Protocol    Version 6.0  
 [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
 
  Page 79 of 96 
 
  (at 6 months) mortality in patients with cranial trauma who were determined not to have other clear indications for corticosteroid treatment. High doses of systemic corticosteroids, including SOLU -MEDROL, should not be used for the treatment of t raumatic brain injury.  
 Cardio -renal  
Average and large doses of corticosteroids can cause elevation of blood pressure, salt and water retention, and increased excretion of potassium. These effects are less likely to occur with the synthetic derivatives exc ept when used in large doses. Dietary salt restriction and potassium 
supplementation may be necessary. All corticosteroids increase calcium excretion.  
 
Literature reports suggest an apparent association between the use of corticosteroids and left 
ventricul ar free wall rupture after a recent myocardial infarction; therefore, therapy with 
corticosteroids should be used with great caution in these patients.  
 Endocrine  
Hypothalamic -pi[INVESTIGATOR_80560] (HPA) axis suppression, Cushing’s syndrome, and 
hyperglycemia. Monitor patients for these conditions with chronic use.  
 Corticosteroids can produce reversible HPA axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency after withdrawal of treatment. Drug induced secondary adrenocortical insufficienc y may be minimized by [CONTACT_80617]. This type of 
relative insufficiency may persist for months after discontinuation of therapy; therefore, in any situation of stress occurring during that period, hormone therapy should be reinstituted. 
 
Drug-Induced Liver Injury  
Rarely, high doses of cyclically pulsed intravenous methylprednisolone (usually for the 
treatment of exacerbations of multiple sclerosis at doses of 1 gram/day) can induce a toxic form of acute hepatitis. The time to onset of this fo rm of steroid -induced liver injury can be several 
weeks or longer. Resolution has been observed after discontinuation of treatment. However, serious liver injury can occur, sometimes resulting in acute liver failure and  death. Discontinue 
intravenous methy lprednisolone if toxic hepatitis occurs.  Since recurrence has occurred after 
re-challenge, avoid use of high dose intravenous  
 
methylprednisolone in patients with a history of toxic hepatitis caused by [CONTACT_80618].  
 
Infections  
General  
Patients w ho are on corticosteroids are more susceptible to infections than are healthy individuals. 
There may be decreased resistance and inability to localize infection when corticosteroids are used. 
Infections with any pathogen (viral, bacterial, fungal, protozoa n, or helminthic) in any location of the 
body may be associated with the use of corticosteroids alone or in combination with other 
immunosuppressive agents.  
STRESS Trial Protocol    Version 6.0  
 [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
 
  Page [ADDRESS_87949] in the presence of ac ute local infection.  
A study has failed to establish the efficacy of methylprednisolone sodium succinate in the treatment 
of sepsis syndrome and septic shock. The study also suggests that treatment of these conditions with 
methylprednisolone sodium succinate may increase the risk of mortality in certain patients (i.e., patients with elevated serum creatinine levels or patients who develop secondary infections after 
methylprednisolone sodium succinate).  
Fungal infections  
Corticosteroids may exacerbate sys temic fungal infections and therefore should not be used in the 
presence of such infections unless they are needed to control drug reactions. There have been cases 
reported in which concomitant use of amphotericin B and hydrocortisone was followed by [CONTACT_80619] (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS , 
Drug Interactions , Amphotericin B injection and potassium -depleting agents ).  
Special pathogens  
Latent disease may be activated or there may be an exacerbation of intercur rent infections due to 
pathogens, including those caused by [CONTACT_80620], Candida, Cryptococcus, Mycobacterium, Nocardia, 
Pneumocystis, Toxoplasma.  
It is recommended that latent amebiasis or active amebiasis be ruled out before initiating 
corticosteroid therapy  in any patient who has spent time in the tropi[INVESTIGATOR_80561].  
Similarly, corticosteroids should be used with great care in patients with known or suspected 
Strongyloides (threadworm) infestation. In such patients, corticos teroid -induced immunosuppression 
may lead to Strongyloides hyperinfection and dissemination with widespread larval migration, often 
accompanied by [CONTACT_80621] -negative septicemia.
 
 
Corticosteroids should not be used in c erebral malaria. There is currently no evidence of benefit 
from steroids in this condition.  
Tuberculosis  
The use of corticosteroids in active tuberculosis should be restricted to those cases of 
fulminating or disseminated tuberculosis in which the cortic osteroid is used for the management 
of the disease in conjunction with appropriate antituberculous regimen.  
If corticosteroids are indicated in patients with latent tuberculosis or tuberculin reactivity, close 
observation is necessary as reactivation of t he disease may occur. During prolonged corticosteroid 
therapy, these patients should receive chemoprophylaxis.  
Vaccination  
STRESS Trial Protocol    Version 6.0  
 [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
 
  Page 81 of 96 
 
  Administration of live or live, attenuated vaccines is contraindicated in patients receiving 
immunosuppressive doses of corticoster oids. Killed or inactivated vaccines may be 
administered. However, the response to such vaccines cannot be predicted . Immunization 
procedures may be undertaken in patients receiving corticosteroids as replacement therapy, e.g., for 
Addison’s disease.  
Viral infections  
Chicken pox and measles can have a more serious or even fatal course in pediatric and adult patients 
on corticosteroids. In pediatric and adult patients who have not had these diseases, particular care 
should be taken to avoid exposure. The c ontribution of the underlying disease and/or prior 
corticosteroid treatment to the risk is also not known. If exposed to chicken pox, prophylaxis with 
varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) may be indicated. If exposed to measles, prophylaxis with 
immunoglobulin (IG) may be indicated. (See the respective package inserts for complete VZIG and IG prescribing information.) If chicken pox develops, treatment with antiviral agents should be 
considered.  
Neurologic  
Reports of severe medical events have been ass ociated with the intrathecal route of 
administration (see ADVERSE REACTIONS , Gastrointestinal and Neurologic/Psychiatric ).  
Ophthalmic  
Use of corticosteroids may produce posterior subcapsular cataracts, glaucoma with possible damage 
to the optic nerves, a nd may enhance the establishment of secondary ocular infections due to 
bacteria, fungi, or viruses. The use of oral corticosteroids is not recommended in the treatment of 
optic neuritis and may lead to an increase in the risk of new epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]. Corticosteroi ds should be used 
cautiously in patients with ocular herpes simplex because of corneal perforation. Corticosteroids 
should not be used in active ocular herpes simplex. 
 
PRECAUTIONS  
 
General  
This product, like many other steroid formulations, is sensitive  to heat. Therefore, it should not 
be autoclaved when it is desirable to sterilize the exterior of the vial.  
The lowest possible dose of corticosteroid should be used to control the condition under treatment. 
When reduction in dosage is possible, the reduction should be gradual.  
Since complications of treatment with glucocorticoids are dependent on the size of the dose and 
the duration of treatment, a risk/benefit decision must be made in each individual case as to dose 
and duration of treatment and as to whether daily or intermittent therapy should be used.  
Kaposi’s sarcoma has been reported to occur in patients receiving corticosteroid therapy, most often 
for chronic conditions. Discontinuation of corticosteroids may result in clinical improvement.  
Cardio-renal  
STRESS Trial Protocol    Version 6.0  
 [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
 
  Page [ADDRESS_87950] for months after discontinuation of 
therapy; therefore, in any situation of stress occurring during that peri od, hormone therapy 
should be reinstituted.  
Metabolic clearance of corticosteroids is decreased in hypothyroid patients and increased in 
hyperthyroid patients. Changes in thyroid status of the patient may necessitate adjustment in dosage.  
Gastrointestinal  
Steroids should be used with caution in active or latent peptic ulcers, diverticulitis, fresh intestinal 
anastomoses, and nonspecific ulcerative colitis, since they may increase the risk of a perforation. 
Signs of peritoneal irritation following gastroi ntestinal perforation in patients receiving 
corticosteroids may be minimal or absent.  
There is an enhanced effect due to decreased metabolism of corticosteroids in patients with 
cirrhosis.  
Musculoskeletal  
Corticosteroids decrease bone formation and incre ase bone resorption both through their effect on 
calcium regulation (i.e., decreasing absorption and increasing excretion) and inhibition of osteoblast 
function. This, together with a decrease in the protein matrix of the bone secondary to an increase in 
protein catabolism, and reduced sex hormone  production, may lead to inhibition of bone growth 
in pediatric patients and the development of osteoporosis at any age. Special consideration 
should be given to patients at increased risk of osteoporosis (i.e., postmenopausal women) before initiating corticosteroid therapy.  
 
Local injection of a steroid into a previously infected site is not usually recommended. 
 
Neurologic -Psychiatric  
Although controlled clinical trials have shown corticosteroids to be effective i n speeding the 
resolution of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, they do not show that corticosteroids affect the ultimate outcome or natural history of the disease. The studies do show that relatively high doses of corticosteroids are necessary to demonstrate a significant effect. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.)  
 An acute myopathy has been observed with the use of high doses of corticosteroids, most often occurring in patients with disorders of neuromuscular transmission (e.g., myasthenia gravis), or in patients receiving concomitant therapy with neuromuscular blocking drugs (e.g., pancuronium). This acute myopathy is generalized, may involve ocular and respi[INVESTIGATOR_80562] 6.0

  muscles, and may result in quadriparesis. Elevations of creatine kinase may occur. Cl inical 
improvement or recovery after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_80563].  
 Psychic derangements may appear when corticosteroids are used, ranging from euphoria, insomnia, mood swings, personality changes, and severe depression, to frank psychotic manifestations. Also, existing emotional instability or psychotic tendencies may be aggravated by [CONTACT_13216].  
 
Ophthalmic  
Intraocular pressure may become elevated in some individuals. If steroid therapy is continued for more than 6 weeks, intra ocular pressure should be monitored.  
 Information for Patients  
Patients should be warned not to discontinue the use of corticosteroids abruptly or without 
medical supervision, to advise any medical attendants that they are taking corticosteroids, and 
to seek medical advice at once should they develop fever or other signs of infection.  
 Persons who are on corticosteroids should be warned to avoid exposure to chicken pox or measles. Patients should also be advised that if they are exposed, medical advice shou ld be 
sought without delay.  
 Drug Interactions  
Aminoglutethimide: Aminoglutethimide  may lead to a loss of corticosteroid -induced adrenal 
suppression.  
Amphotericin B injection and potassium -depleting agents: When corticosteroids are administered 
concomitant ly with potassium -depleting agents (i.e., amphotericin B, diuretics), patients should be 
observed closely for development of hypokalemia. There have been cases reported in which 
concomitant use of amphotericin B and hydrocortisone was followed by [CONTACT_80622] e nlargement and 
congestive heart failure.  
Antibiotics : Macrolide antibiotics have been reported to cause a significant decrease in 
corticosteroid clearance (see Drug Interactions , Hepatic Enzyme Inhibitors ).  
Anticholinesterases : Concomitant use of anticholinesterase agents and corticosteroids may 
produce severe weakness in patients with myasthenia gravis. If possible, anticholinesterase 
agents should be withdrawn at least 24 hours before initiating corticosteroid therapy.  
Anticoagulants, oral : Coadministr ation of corticosteroids and warfarin usually results in inhibition 
of response to warfarin, although there have been some conflicting reports. Therefore, coagulation indices should be monitored frequently to maintain the desired anticoagulant effect.  
Antidiabetics : Because corticosteroids may increase blood glucose concentrations, dosage 
adjustments of antidiabetic agents may be required.  
Antitubercular drugs : Serum concentrations of isoniazid may be decreased.  
STRESS Trial Protocol    Version 6.0  
 [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
 
  Page 84 of 96 
 
  Cholestyramine : Cholestyramine may increas e the clearance of corticosteroids.  
Cyclosporine : Increased activity of both cyclosporine and corticosteroids may occur when the two 
are used concurrently. Convulsions have been reported with this concurrent use.  
Digitalis glycosides : Patients on digitalis glycosides may be at increased risk of 
arrhythmias due to hypokalemia.  
Estrogens, including oral contraceptives : Estrogens may decrease the hepatic metabolism of certain 
corticosteroids, thereby [CONTACT_80623].  
Hepatic Enzyme Inducers (e.g., barbiturates, phenytoin, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], rifampin) : Drugs which 
induce cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme activity may enhance the metabolism of corticosteroids and 
require that the dosage of the corticosteroid be increased.  
Hepatic Enzyme Inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, macrolide antibiotics such as erythromycin and 
troleandomycin): Drugs which inhibit cytochrome P450 3A4 have the potential to result in increased 
plasma concentrations of corticosteroids.  
 
Ketoconazole : Ketoconazole has been reported to significant ly decrease the metabolism of certain 
corticosteroids by [CONTACT_8622] 60%, leading to an increased risk of corticosteroid side effects.  
Nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory agents (NSAIDs) : Concomitant use of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] (or other 
nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory agents) and corticosteroids increases the risk of gastrointestinal 
side effects. Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_80564]. The clearance of salicylates may be increased with concurrent use of corticosteroids.  
Skin tests : Corticosteroids may suppress reactions to skin tests.  
Vaccines : Patients on prolonged corticosteroid therapy may exhibit a diminished response to toxoids 
and live or inactivated vaccines due to inhibition of antibody response. Corticosteroids may also 
potentiate the replication of some organisms contained in live attenuated vaccines. Routine 
administration of vaccines or toxoids should be deferred until corticosteroid therapy is discontinued if possible (see WARNINGS , Infections , Vaccination ).  
Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility  
No adequate studies have been conducted in animals to determine whether corticosteroids have a potential for carcinogenesis or mutagenesis.  
Steroids may increase or decrease motility and number of spermat ozoa in some patients.  
Corticosteroids have been shown to impair fertility in male rats.

PRECAUTIONS: Pediatric use.  
Nursing Mothers  
Systemically administered corticosteroids appear in human milk and could suppress growth, interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production, or cause other untoward effects. Because of the potential 
for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from corticosteroids, a decision should be made 
whether to continue nursing, or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance o f the drug 
to the mother. 
 
Pediatric Use 
Some formulations of this product contain benzyl alcohol as a preservative (see 
DESCRIPTION). Carefully examine vials to determine formulation that is being used.  
 Benzyl alcohol, a component of this product, has be en associated with serious adverse events 
and death, particularly in pediatric patients. The “gaspi[INVESTIGATOR_80565]” (characterized by [CONTACT_80624], metabolic acidosis, gaspi[INVESTIGATOR_80566], and high levels of benzyl alcohol and its metabol ites found in the blood and urine) has been associated with benzyl 
alcohol dosages >99 mg/kg/day in neonates and low -birth -weight neonates. Additional 
symptoms may include gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematologic a bnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, 
bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Although normal therapeutic doses of this product ordinarily delivers amounts of benzyl alcohol that are substantially lower than those reported in 
association with the “gaspi[INVESTIGATOR_80565]”, the minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known. The risk of benzyl alcohol toxicity depends on the quantity administered and the hepatic capacity to detoxify the chemical. Prematur e and low -birth -weight 
infants, as well as patients receiving high dosages, may be more likely to develop toxicity. Practitioners administering this and other medications containing benzyl alcohol should consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl  alcohol from all sources.  
 The efficacy and safety of corticosteroids in the pediatric population are based on the well -
established course of effect of corticosteroids which is similar in pediatric and adult populations. Published studies provide evidence  of efficacy and safety in pediatric patients for 
the treatment of nephrotic syndrome (>2 years of age), and aggressive lymphomas and leukemias (>1 month of age). Other indications for pediatric use of corticosteroids, e.g., severe 
asthma and wheezing, are based on adequate and well - controlled trials conducted in adults, on

  the premises that the course of the diseases and their pathophysiology are considered to be substantially similar in both populations.  The adverse effects of corticosteroids in pediatr ic patients are similar to those in adults (see 
ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Like adults, pediatric patients should be carefully observed with 
frequent measurements of blood pressure, weight, height, intraocular pressure, and clinical evaluation for the presence of  infection, psychosocial disturbances, thromboembolism, peptic 
ulcers, cataracts, and osteoporosis. Pediatric patients who are treated with corticosteroids by [CONTACT_28414], including systemically administered corticosteroids, may experience a decrease in thei r 
growth velocity. This negative impact of corticosteroids on growth has been observed at low systemic doses and in the absence of laboratory evidence of HPA axis suppression (i.e., cosyntropin stimulation and basal cortisol plasma levels). Growth velocity may therefore be a 
more sensitive indicator of systemic corticosteroid exposure in pediatric patients than some commonly used tests of HPA axis function. The linear growth of pediatric patients treated with corticosteroids should be monitored, and the pot ential growth effects of prolonged treatment 
should be weighed against clinical benefits obtained and the availability of treatment alternatives. In order to minimize the potential growth effects of corticosteroids, pediatric patients should be titrated to  the lowest effective dose.

OVERDOSAGE Treatment of acute overdosage is by [CONTACT_80625]. For chronic 
overdos age in the face of severe disease requiring continuous steroid therapy, the dosage of the 
corticosteroid may be reduced only temporarily, or alternate day treatment may be introduced.  
 
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION NOTE: Some of the SOLU -MEDROL formulations co ntain benzyl alcohol (see 
DESCRIPTION, WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS, Pediatric Use)  
Because of possible physical incompatibilities, SOLU -MEDROL should not be 
diluted or mixed with other solutions.  
 
Use only the accompanying diluent or Bacteriostatic Water For Injection with Benzyl 
Alcohol when reconstituting SOLU -MEDROL (see DESCRIPTION). Use within 48 hours 
after mixing.  
 
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution an d container permit.  
 
This preparation may be administered by [CONTACT_439], by [CONTACT_5204], or by 
[CONTACT_80626], the preferred method for initial emergency use being 
intravenous 
injection. Following the initial emergency period, consideration should be given to employing a 
longer acting injectable preparation or an oral preparation.  
 
There are reports of cardiac arrhythmias and/or cardiac arrest following the rapid administration of 
large intravenous doses of SOLU -MEDROL ( greater than 0.5 gram administered over a period of 
less than 10 minutes ). Bradycardia has been reported during or after the administration of large 
doses of methylprednisolone sodium succinate, and may be unrelated to the speed or duration of 
infusion. When high dose therapy is desired, the recommended dose of SOLU -MEDROL Sterile 
Powder is 30 mg/kg administered intravenously over at least 30 minutes . This dose may be 
repeated every 4 to 6 hours for 48 hours.  
In general, high dose corticosteroid therapy should be  continued only until the patient’s condition 
has stabilized; usually not beyond 48 to 72 hours.

  Page [ADDRESS_87953] dosage which will maintain an adequate clinical response is 
reached. Situations which may make dosage adjustments necessary are changes in clinical status 
secondary to remissions or exacerbations in the disease process, the patient’s indi vidual drug 
responsiveness, and the effect of patient exposure to stressful situations not directly related to the disease entity under treatment. In this latter situation, it may be necessary to increase the dosage 
of the corticosteroid for a period of ti me consistent with the patient’s condition. If after long-term 
therapy the drug is to be stopped, it is recommended that it be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly.  
 
SOLU -MEDROL may be administered by [CONTACT_80627], the preferred method for initial emergency use being intravenous injection. To administer 
by [CONTACT_33980] (or intramuscular) injection, prepare solution as directed. The desired dose may be 
administered intravenously over a period of severa l minutes. If desired, the medication may be 
administered in diluted solutions by [CONTACT_80628] (see below) 
to the Act -O-Vial and withdrawing the indicated dose.  
To prepare solutions for intravenous infusion, first prepare the solution for injection as directed. 
This solution may then be added to indicated amounts of 5% dextrose in water, isotonic saline 
solution, or 5% dextrose in isotonic saline solution. 
 
In pediatric patients, the initial dose of methylprednisolon e may vary depending on the specific 
disease entity being treated. The range of initial doses is 0.11 to 1.6 mg/kg/day in three or four 
divided doses (3.2 to 48 mg/m2bsa/day).  
 
The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) recommended dosing for systemic 
prednisone, prednisolone, or methylprednisolone in pediatric patients whose asthma is uncontrolled by [CONTACT_80629]- acting bronchodilators is 1- 2 mg/kg/day in 
single or divided doses. It is further recommended that short course, or “burst” therapy, be continued until the patient achieves a peak expi[INVESTIGATOR_80568] 80% of his or her personal best or until symptoms resolve. This usually requires 3 to 10 days of treatment, although it can take longer. There is no evidence that tapering the dose after improvement will prevent a relapse.  
 
Dosage may be reduced for infants and children but should be governed more by [CONTACT_80630]. It should not be less than 0.5 mg per kg every 24 hours.

Sub-study Background and Ratio nale:   
Nearly 20,[ADDRESS_87961] (CHD) surgery every year. Infant CHD 
surgery is associated with poor outcomes - mortality in ~3 -5% and major morbidity in ~ 30%.[ADDRESS_87962] -operative acut e kidney injury (AKI).  Factors that contribute to 
post -surgical AKI include renal ischemia, reperfusion injury, oxidation, inflammation and 
cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_80631].2-5 Hemolysis from c ardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_80632] a major 
contributor that might be amenable to intervention. Hemolysis causes AKI by [CONTACT_80633] -free 
hemoglobin.  This results in hemeprotein -mediated lipid peroxidation and renal vasoconstriction, thus 
producing renal injury .2,6  
 The risk of AKI may be reduced by [CONTACT_80634] .  
For example, f indings from in vitro and mouse studies demonstrate that acetaminophen reduces 
nephrotoxic hemoglobin radicals7,8 and lipid peroxidation to d ecrease the incidence of AKI.9  Further, in 
children undergoing cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_6476], acetaminophen attenuates markers of lipid peroxidation6 
and is associated with reduced odds of AKI.10   
For many medications, including acetaminophen, the  pharmacokinet ics (PK) and 
pharmacodynamics (PD) are not defined in the post-operative CHD population for AKI prevention.  For 
many commonly used medications,  the PK and PD likely differ when used for prevention and/or 
treatment of AKI after CHD surgery  as compared to h ealthy subjects .  Therefore, a crucial step to ensure 
successful future studies is defining the PK and exposure-response profiles for  the treatment/prevention 
of AKI in infants after CHD surgery.

Study Design:  
In subjects  enrolled at Duke University  who participate in the optional PK/PD and/or biomarker 
sampling, we will conduct a single -arm, open label standard of care dosing study of  drugs affecting renal 
injury received in the first 24 hours after cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_6476]  -- primarily trageting acetaminophen, 
which is used commonly, but also to evaluate other potentially nephrotoxic or renal protective agents .  
Patient inclusion and exclusion criteria will be identical to the parent study .  In addition to the already 
collected plasma samples,  urinary biomarker samples will be collected and validated bioanalytical 
assays will be performed at a central lab.     
Sampling P rocedure:   
Serum: No additional drug plasma samples will be collected during this study.  As available, 
excess plasma from the parent study  sampling  scheme (see Table 5 of main protocol)  will be used to 
characterize PK for medications (e.g. acetaminophen a nd metabolites) given per standard of care and 
associated with post -by[CONTACT_80635].  
 Urine: Urinary biomarkers of renal injury, including NGAL, will be collected in sampling schemes 
noted in Appendix Table 1.  Sampling will only occur for patients with indwelling urinary catheters at the time of sample collection.

Sample Number  Time  Per patient urine collection

2 2-6 hours after completion  of CPB  1 x 3mL (minimum 1mL)  
3 18-24 hours after completion of CPB  1 x 3mL (minimum 1mL)  
 
Sample Handling Procedures:  
Similar to the parent study, assays to measure drug levels/metabolites in plasma, as well as 
biomarkers of renal injury in urine, will be conducted at a central lab using validate bioanalytical assays.  
For plasma,  date and time will be recorded for the administration of parent study drug/placebo,  
acetaminophen  and the acquisition time of the PK sample.  For urine, date and time will be recorded for 
completion of CPB and acquisition time of the biomarker sample.  All samples will be stored at -80° C 
until analysis.    
 
Analytic approach:  
Plasma PK data will be analyzed with a nonlinear mixed -effects model to determine drug and 
metabolite vo lume of distribution and clearance.  Dose-exposure simulations will predict AUC 0-24.  Linked 
PK/PD compartmental analysis will be performed to determine the acetaminophen exposure association to the primary pharmacodynamic outcome, staged KDIGO -defined AKI , and model optimal dosing. An 
exploratory pharmacodynamic outcome of concentration of urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) will also be included in analysis.

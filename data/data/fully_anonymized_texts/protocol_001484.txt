TITLE:  Examining the Impact of Sirolimus on Ketamine’s Antidepressant Effects   III. PURPOSE:  Ketamine is an anesthetic agent, recently found to exert a rapid and potent antidepressant effect in severely depressed patients. Controversy exists in the field regarding how ketamine works in the brain and thus what underlies its rapid and profound antidepressant effects. A better understanding of the mechanism of the neuropsychiatric effects of ketamine are critically important, as pharmacological modulation of these effects can assist in the development of novel medications for the treatment of multiple psychiatric disorders including depression and schizophrenia.     The aim of the study is to provide insight into the impact of the immunosuppressant drug sirolimus (also known as rapamycin; known to have impact on depressive symptoms from molecular and preclinical studies), on the antidepressant effects of the prototypal rapid-acting antidepressant medication, ketamine. More specifically, the study will examine whether sirolimus shows significant interactive effects (i.e., synergy or antagonism) with ketamine in participants with treatment resistant depression as measured by [CONTACT_542969]-administered Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). We will also test the tolerability of the combined ketamine and sirolimus treatment. Secondary outcome measures are designed to measure the effects of sirolimus on the tolerability of ketamine.   § Aim 1: To characterize the effects of a single dose of sirolimus prior to a low dose of ketamine in subjects with antidepressant-resistant depressive symptoms.   Design: 30 participants will be randomized into one of two groups at Time/Infusion 1 — ketamine+sirolimus (with placebo at Time 2) or ketamine+placebo (with sirolimus dose at Time 2).   Hypothesis: Sirolimus will interact with ketamine by [CONTACT_542970].    § Aim 2: To examine the safety and tolerability of combined ketamine-sirolimus treatment.        Design: The Systematic Assessment for Treatment Emergent Effects (SAFTEE) scale will be completed during each visit to compare the adverse events profile in the sirolimus and the placebo groups. 
  3/29/18   Page 2  Hypothesis: Participants will tolerate the combined treatment with no residual adverse effects. § Aim 3: To identify biological markers of the combined ketamine-sirolimus treatment.        Design: Inflammatory biomarkers will be measured in 18 depressed participants who will receive open-label sirolimus+ketamine. Hypothesis: Twenty-four hours post-treatment, sirolimus+ketamine will significantly reduce the inflammatory biomarkers.   IV. BACKGROUND   Despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] [ADDRESS_708630] as it was in the early 1960’s, when the prescription of tricyclic antidepressants became widespread.  Depression is treated predominately by [CONTACT_542971] (serotonin, norepi[INVESTIGATOR_238]).  While more than 20 antidepressant medications are currently available, the efficacy of these medications is limited.5-8 These antidepressants only produce clinical remission in approximately 30% of patients in their initial clinical trial, after two drugs are tried, each new attempt at treatment only 10%-15% of patients would remit, and after multiple trials over a year only 60%-70% of patients would have a satisfactory response to treatment.  Further, among those patients who do respond, clinical response only emerges, on average, after 7 weeks of treatment.9 From these data, it is evident that there is tremendous societal need for a novel class of antidepressants that can offer (1) rapid acting effects and (2) efficacy in patients not achieving adequate benefit from existing medications. Over the last decade, accumulating evidence has shown that low dose of ketamine, a N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, may possess both of these properties.[ADDRESS_708631] dose of ketamine.  Second, rather than producing response in 10%-15% of patients “treatment-resistant” depression symptoms, 50% of patients met response criteria within [ADDRESS_708632] ketamine.  Subsequent studies by [CONTACT_542972]-like drugs essentially replicated these observations in patients with unipolar and bipolar (manic-depressive) depression.15-[ADDRESS_708633] investigated the efficacy of 0.5 mg/kg ketamine infusion in more than 300 depressed 
  3/29/18   Page 3  patients.14, 15, 20, 24-36 These studies consistently showed a rapid antidepressant action within 4-hours of ketamine’s administration, with a short-term response rate ranging from 43% to 90%.31, 37  The mechanisms of action and underlying neurobiology of ketamine’s antidepressant effects are not yet fully known or understood. We believe that advancing our understanding of how ketamine acts on the brain to produce its antidepressant effects is critical for improving the effectiveness and safety of ketamine and/or novel drugs development from the ketamine model. The safety concerns related to ketamine emerge from its abuse liability and its propensity to produce transient changes in cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_542948].  In order to limit the risks of ketamine or to engineer a better ketamine, we need to better understand how it works.  There is controversy in the field regarding how ketamine produces its antidepressant effects. Specifically, investigators argue whether the rapid-antidepressant effects of the drug are secondary to direct action or indirect consequence of ketamine’s effects on brain networks.  Stress and depression appear to strip the brain of fine connections between nerve cells (dendritic spi[INVESTIGATOR_1651]) within brain circuits that regulate mood.  Ketamine appears to cause these fine connections to regrow rapi[INVESTIGATOR_542949] a period that lasts as long as the antidepressant effects of a single ketamine injection last in humans, i.e., up to a few weeks.[ADDRESS_708634] network effects of ketamine, sometimes described as “stimulating the go pathway” described in figure 1,[ADDRESS_708635] in nerve cells involving a protein called “the mammalian target of rapamycin” (mTOR).  According to this theory, the co-administration of sirolimus, an immunosuppressant drug commonly prescribed for prophylaxis of renal transplant rejection, should reduce the antidepressant effectiveness of ketamine.   However, the other major hypothesis is related to the ability of ketamine to directly block signaling via the “stop pathway”, i.e., to remove an inhibition on dendritic spi[INVESTIGATOR_542950].40 By [CONTACT_47506] a very specific sub-type of receptor target for glutamate in the brain (NR2B subunit-containing NMDA glutamate receptor), ketamine may directly help dendritic spi[INVESTIGATOR_542951] a manner that is independent of mTOR.  Sirolimus has been repeatedly shown to have the potential  Figure 1. The top figure illustrates the presence of synaptic (receives directly released glutamate) and extrasynaptic (receives glutamate “spi[INVESTIGATOR_11036]” from the synapse) glutamate receptors.  Ketamine may exert its treatment effects either indirectly by [CONTACT_542973] “go pathway” (synaptic AMPA glutamate receptors) or by [CONTACT_542974] “stop pathway” (extrasynaptic NR2B-containing NMDA glutamate receptors). 

  3/29/[ADDRESS_708636] effects of ketamine on the “stop pathway” pertain, then the antidepressant effects of sirolimus might increase the efficacy of ketamine.  Molecular studies in animals have found that synaptic deficits are precipi[INVESTIGATOR_542952],[ADDRESS_708637] of antidepressants in animal models of depression.45, 46 Enhancing mTOR signaling or increasing BDNF produces antidepressant effects in preclinical studies.45, 46 In humans, reduced central and peripheral BDNF levels were found in depressed patients45, 47 and a functional variant of BDNF polymorphism (Val66Met) has been related to depression, especially in males.48 Together these data posit that enhancing DBNF and mTOR signaling leading to prefrontal synaptic formation (synaptogenesis), and reversal of stress/depression-induced neuronal atrophy and synaptic dysconnectivity is a required step for efficacious antidepressant treatment. Traditional antidepressants, targeting the monoaminergic system, were found to increase BDNF and synaptogenesis.45, [ADDRESS_708638] the interactive effects of ketamine and sirolimus, a simple clinical trial that has: 1) the potential to shed fundamental light on how ketamine produces rapid clinical improvement and 2) to suggest a strategy for increasing the effectiveness of ketamine.  If sirolimus reduces the antidepressant effects of ketamine, then we will know that stimulation of mTOR is critical to the antidepressant effects of ketamine, leading us to test other drugs that directly stimulate this signaling pathway.  The results of Phase 1 & [ADDRESS_708639] shown sirolimus pretreatment significantly prolong the antidepressant effects of ketamine and triples the antidepressant response rate at 2 weeks following treatment (see Fig. 2) 50. Given the role of the immune system in the pathology and treatment of depression, it was proposed that the anti-inflammatory effects of the combined treatment of sirolimus+ketamine underlie the robust enhancement in treatment response rate. Therefore, we will conduct a pi[INVESTIGATOR_542953]+ketamine on a range of inflammatory biomarkers implicated in the pathology of depression. The aim of this Phase 3 of the study is to provide preliminary data about target engagement of the sirolimus+ketamine treatment. The treatment and follow-ups will be comparable to the Phase 2 study, but only open-label sirolimus+ketamine will be administered and the weekly follow-ups will be extended to [ADDRESS_708640]-treatment.  V. SIGNIFICANCE: The proposed project has potential to yield results critical to developi[INVESTIGATOR_542954]-acting antidepressant medications based on the ketamine model. Specifically, if our results indicate 
  3/29/[ADDRESS_708641] is critical to the antidepressant effects of ketamine, resolving a major controversy in the field and implicating drugs facilitating mTOR signaling in the treatment of depression.   This proposal has potential to provide critical insights into the mechanisms of ketamine’s antidepressant effects thus advancing our understanding of the neurobiology of depression and informing novel drug development for a new generation of rapid-acting antidepressants.   VI. RESEARCH PLAN:  This project will be divided into three phases as described below:   Phase One: Open Label We anticipate recruiting [ADDRESS_708642] evaluate the safety of combining Ketamine with Sirolimus (same inclusion/exclusion criteria, recruitment procedures, and assessments as detailed below under Phase two of the study). Specifically, we will implement a 10- hour post-Sirolimus observation period that will take place in the Biostudies Unit (9th floor, building 1). Participants will then be asked to return to Biostudies on the morning following the administration of Rapamycin and Ketamine for additional assessment. Transportation will be arranged from Biostudies to the participants’ homes and back to Biostudies the following day. In addition, the participants will be provided with a direct telephone number that they can use at any time between the end of the 10-hour observation phase and their appointment on the following day so they can contact a study psychiatrist in case of emergency or adverse effects. For [ADDRESS_708643] on Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). (A) There is a significant main effect of time (F(8,245) = 43.5, p < 0.0001), demonstrating significant decrease in MADRS scores from baseline. There is also significant interaction between treatment and time (F(8,245) = 2.0, p = 0.04), with overall reduction in depression scores following treatment with rapamycin+ketamine (Rapamycin; blue line), compared to post placebo+ketamine (Placebo; red line). (B) Response rate was significantly higher following treatment with rapamycin+ketamine (Rapamycin; blue), compared to post placebo+ketamine (Placebo; red). NOTES: Response was defined as 50% improvement in MADRS from baseline; Error bars are standard errors of mean (SEM); d` = Cohen’s d` effect size compared to pretreatment MADRS scores; Comparison at each time point is marked with * for p ≤ 0.05 and t for p = 0.12;

The Phase One procedures are further detailed below:   Phase One Research Procedures  Day 1: T-130 min: Subjects will present to the VACHS to complete vitals and provide a urine sample for drug and pregnancy testing.  T-120 min: Subjects will receive a single 6 mg oral dose of sirolimus. They will be monitored for any acute allergic reaction or other adverse event. Clinical assessments administered including PSWQ, PSQI, MADRS, QIDS-SR, CGI, HAM-A, CADSS, PANSS (assessment measures are described below). T-60: Intravenous lines started.  T 0*: Blood draw for sirolimus level. Ketamine infusion begins (0.5 mg/kg infused over approximately 40 minutes). Subjects will be monitored closely by [CONTACT_542975].  T+15: Blood draw for sirolimus and ketamine levels. T+30: CADSS, PANSS.  T+40: Blood draw for sirolimus and ketamine levels. T+60**: MADRS, QIDS-SR, CGI.  T+120: CADSS, PANSS, MADRS, QIDS-SR, CGI. T+230: MADRS, QIDS-SR, CGI, HAM-A.  Ten hours post sirolimus administration, subjects will be evaluated by a study physician or APRN and will be medically cleared for discharge. Subjects will be provided with a study physician’s direct telephone number that they can use at any time in case of emergency or adverse effects.   *Blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation will be recorded every 10 minutes during infusion (T0-40 minutes).  Ketamine Administration Notes:  Subjects in Phase One will receive one infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg infusion over approximately 40 minutes). The ketamine dose and route of administration are similar to that seen in previous investigations and has demonstrated high safety and tolerability.   A physician who is trained and has significant experience with both ketamine and infusion studies will oversee and administer the ketamine infusions. A nurse will also be present with the subject from the insertion of bilateral cannula for drug infusion and blood sampling, through to recovery following ketamine infusion. Sirolimus Administration Notes:  Subjects will receive a single [ADDRESS_708644] Formica, Director of Transplant Medicine, Yale University, an expert with sirolimus treatment, it is expected that a single 6 mg oral dose will produce minimal adverse effects.  
  3/29/18   Page 7  Day 2 /Follow-Up: Subjects will present to the VACHS to complete clinical assessments and a brief cognitive assessment. Procedures for this 24-hour follow-up will be identical to Phase Two follow-up procedures described below; however, subjects who participate in this 24-hour follow-up for Phase One will not receive any medications or infusions at follow-up. They will be asked about any residual side effects of other adverse events (AEs) and any appropriate referral for treatment will be made as necessary. Transportation to and from Biostudies will be arranged.    Days 3-7/ Phone Follow-Up: After the Day [ADDRESS_708645] Phase One participants by [CONTACT_756], daily until Day 7.

Privacy:  All reports generated from the data obtained through this study will protect the confidentiality of the subjects who participate in this study.  In case of a medical emergency, the medication group blinding can be broken by [CONTACT_1716][INVESTIGATOR_1660] [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a designated covering staff member, in order to supply information required for emergency medical care of research subjects. All subjects will be given a “wallet card” which identifies them as a study participant and lists the emergency contact [CONTACT_15750].  If a subject shows clinical deterioration (worsening of depressive symptoms that is higher than 25% of baseline MADRS scores), the participant will exit the study and a study psychiatrist (or APRN) will determine whether a higher level of care (e.g. referral to treating psychiatrist or referral to emergency or inpatient care) is needed.  Selection:  Subject eligibility will first be determined via telephone screening and if records are available, by a preliminary medical record review. A waiver of HIPAA authorization and written informed consent will be obtained for a brief initial phone pre-screen (see Appendix 1) and preliminary medical record review. The phone pre-screen and preliminary medical record review will be done to determine obvious exclusions from the study protocol and to prevent subjects from making unnecessary travel for screening. A separate Phone Pre-screen Identification Page (see Appendix 2) will be completed during each telephone pre-screen so the research staff will have the necessary information to access potential participants’ medical records (with the proper verbal assent) and re-contact [CONTACT_542978].  This identification page will be stored in a separate location from the screening form that will only list the subject ID.   Recruitment: Subjects will be recruited by [CONTACT_542979], public advertisements (e.g., print, newspaper, radio, bus, billboards, online postings (including Trialfacts/Rewards for Research online marketing and recruitment service and Craigslist.com), social media (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Instagram), digital media (e.g., TV, online radio, podcasts),by [CONTACT_6063], clinician referral, contact [CONTACT_542980], and through IHR0010, Screening for Depressive, Anxiety, and Trauma and Stress-Related Disorders. We intend to register our study on clinicaltrials.gov. We may also utilize the National Center for PTSD newsletter to advertise the study. Subjects will be identified by [CONTACT_542981]/or internal recruiting. The subjects will be asked to call us if they are interested in participating in the research study. A waiver of HIPAA authorization and written informed consent will be requested for a phone screen and preliminary medical record review in advance of scheduling the in-office screening procedures. There will not be any web-based questionnaires utilized for pre-screening subjects in this study. All available research staff are responsible for recruiting potential subjects.  
  3/29/18   Page 11   Research Plan and Study Procedures: This is a double blind, placebo-controlled, crossover, randomized controlled trial investigating the impact of sirolimus on ketamine’s antidepressant effects in participants with antidepressant-resistant depressive symptoms. Participants will be treated twice with ketamine 0.5 mg/kg infused over [ADDRESS_708647] 2 weeks interval because based on previous studies the majority of patients return to their baseline depression severity within this time period. A description of each study visit is provided here and summarized in Figure 3. See Table 1 for detail regarding the schedule of study events.    Day 0-Baseline Screening: Individuals deemed eligible after the telephone pre-screening will undergo a full in-person screening appointment at the VA Connecticut Healthcare System (VACHS), West Haven campus.  During the evaluation, the study procedures will be described and the subject’s questions will be answered prior to obtaining an informed consent.  The investigator or research staff member obtaining consent will ask the participant to provide a brief summary of the study to ensure they understand what is being asked of them and any potential risks and benefits.  Once consent is obtained, subjects will participate in the following procedures: a biopsychosocial interview, psycho-logical evaluation, a brief cognitive evaluation, a physical examination, ECG, breathalyzer and a blood sample Figure 3.

After completing the baseline screening and being deemed eligible for participation in the study, subjects will be randomized to one of two conditions at Time/Infusion 1 — ketamine+sirolimus (with placebo at Time 2) or ketamine+placebo (with sirolimus dose at Time 2).   Day 1 / Infusion 1: First, the MADRS assessment will be completed to confirm that the participant continues to have significant depressive symptoms (i.e. MADRS ≥ 18) prior to proceeding with Infusion 1. Participants will be rescheduled if depression severity was not met‡. If depression severity is confirmed, Infusion 1 procedures will be completed as follows: • Subjects will present to the VACHS to complete vitals and provide a urine sample for drug and pregnancy testing.  • Subjects will receive a single 6 mg oral dose of sirolimus or placebo, dependent on their randomization. They will be monitored for any acute allergic reaction or other adverse event. Clinical assessments will be administered throughout the infusion visit, including PSWQ, PSQI, MADRS, QIDS-SR, SAFTEE, CGI, HAM-A, CADSS, PANSS** (assessment measures are described below). • Intravenous lines will be placed.  • A blood draw for sirolimus level will occur prior to the beginning of the ketamine infusion.  • Ketamine 0.5 mg/kg will be infused over approximately 40 minutes. Subjects will be monitored closely by [CONTACT_542975].  • A blood draw for ketamine will occur during the ketamine infusion. • One additional blood draw for sirolimus will occur shortly before the participants are discharged from their study visit.  • Subjects may be discharged home after being cleared by a study physician.    ‡ Screening procedures will be repeated if participant was not randomized within 60 days of screening. *Blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation will be recorded every 10 minutes during infusion (T0-40 minutes). ** Items that could not change within a session, e.g. sleep and appetite, will be carried forward from the initial ratings. Day 2+ / 24-hour Follow-Up: Subjects will present to the VACHS to complete clinical assessments and a brief cognitive assessment. They will be asked about any residual side effects of other adverse events (AEs) and any appropriate referral for treatment will be made as necessary.

During these telephone follow-ups, subjects will also be asked about potential side effects or interaction effects they may be experiencing related to the study medications.   Day 8+ / 7-Day Follow-Up:  The procedures for this visit are identical to those described above for Day 2. For special circumstances (e.g., inclement weather, transportation issues, considerable travel burden, etc.) this visit may occur over the phone. In the cases where a phone visit is required, we will forego the cognitive testing as there is not a way to administer this remotely, but all clinical measures and review of AEs will take place.    Day 15+ / 14-Day Follow-Up and Infusion 2:  First, the MADRS assessment will be completed to confirm that the participant continues to have significant depressive symptoms (i.e. within 20% of their baseline MADRS) prior to proceeding with Infusion 2. If depression severity is confirmed, Infusion [ADDRESS_708649] returned to within 20% of their baseline depressive symptoms within the [ADDRESS_708650] returned to within 20% of their baseline depressive symptoms, Infusion 2 will be rescheduled. We will continue to monitor the participant weekly with full assessments identical to Day 2. Participants will be discharged from the study should they maintain these benefits for more than 5 weeks after Infusion 1.   Day 16+ / 24-Hour Follow-Up to Infusion 2:  The procedures for this visit are identical to those described above for Day 2.   Days 17-21+/ Phone Follow-Up: A study staff member will contact [CONTACT_542982] 24-hour follow-up until day 21 of the study to track symptom trajectory using QIDS and MADRS.

Day 43+ / 28-Day Telephone Call:  A telephone call will be made to all subjects to inquire about any potential residual effects of ketamine or sirolimus and other AEs. Any additional follow-up and/or referrals will be arranged as clinically indicated.   Phase Three Research Procedures:  We anticipate recruiting and screening approximately 35 male and female Veterans and non-Veterans/civilians, between the ages of 21-[ADDRESS_708651] only 1 treatment day (i.e., Infusion 1) with open-label sirolimus+ketamine (i.e., no Infusion 2 of placebo+ketamine). The weekly follow-up post Infusion 1, will be up to Day 29+ (i.e., 4 weeks follow-ups instead of 2 weeks). The follow-up period was extended considering the prolonged antidepressant effects of the combined sirolimus+ketamine treatment. The collection, processing and analysis of peripheral inflammatory biomarkers will be completed under a separate protocol and consent (i.e., CA0008). Participants in Phase 2, who consented to be contact[CONTACT_7678], will be invited to participate in Phase 3. This approach will both facilitate recruitment and reduce study risk as these participants who already received and well tolerated the study drug.  Ketamine Administration:  Subjects will complete two test days separated by [CONTACT_28114]. Subjects will receive an infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg infusion over approximately 40 minutes). All subjects will receive two ketamine infusions—once with a placebo and once with a single dose of sirolimus (6 mg, oral administration). The order of placebo and sirolimus is randomized.  Note, the ketamine dose and route of administration are similar to that seen in previous investigations and has demonstrated high safety and tolerability.   A physician who is trained and has significant experience with both ketamine and infusion studies will oversee and administer the ketamine infusions. A nurse will accompany the subject throughout the study sessions, from the insertion of bilateral cannula for drug infusion and blood sampling, through to recovery following ketamine infusion. Sirolimus or Placebo Dosing:  Subjects will receive a single [ADDRESS_708652] Formica, Director of Transplant Medicine, Yale University, an expert with sirolimus treatment, it is expected that a single 6 mg oral dose will produce minimal adverse effects.

Additional tests will be requested as clinically indicated.  
  3/29/[ADDRESS_708654].   Audio Recording: Clinician administered interviews may be audio recorded for inter-rater reliability and staff training purposes. Subject identifying information will not be on the audio recording. Recordings will be stored in a locked cabinet when not in use. Subjects will be asked on the consent form to indicate whether or not they agree to having their clinical interviews audio recorded. If subjects disagree to having their clinical interview audio recorded, it will not affect their eligibility to participate in study procedures.  Data Storage:  Data will be housed at VACHS West Haven campus in Building 1, where the PI’s office is located. The computers where data will be stored are password protected and behind the VA firewall. Only approved research staff will have access to the screening data.   Table 2.

Criteria for Discontinuation Participants may be discontinued from this proposed study at any time. Specific reasons for discontinuing a participant include:  § Voluntary discontinuation by [CONTACT_2299], who is at any time free to discontinue his/her participation in the study without prejudice to further treatment. § Clinical deterioration: The following are objective criteria for clinical deterioration, (1) a 25% increase in MADRS scores at any time during the study, and (2) the onset of active suicidality as assessed by [CONTACT_542983] 5 or more on the item-10 of MADRS.  § Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_542962]. 
  3/29/18   Page 19  § Safety reasons as judged by [CONTACT_093]. § Severe non-compliance to protocol as judged by [CONTACT_093]. § Incorrect enrollment i.e., the subject does not meet the required inclusion/exclusion criteria for the study.  A subject that discontinues will always be asked about the reason(s) for discontinuation and the presence of any adverse events. If possible, they will be seen and assessed by [CONTACT_093]. Adverse events will be followed up as medically necessary.  Participant Compensation: All participants will be compensated for their participation in this study and completion of all study visits is not required for receipt compensation. For Phase One, subjects will be paid $10/hour, not to exceed $70 for the baseline-screening visit. They will receive $100 for the medication visit, and they will receive $50 for the 24-hour follow-up visit. They will also be reimbursed for transportation based on mileage or receipts provided up to $50 per visit. At the discretion of the investigator, subjects may be reimbursed for additional costs including travel, parking, transportation, meals, or other expenses. Subjects will be asked to provide receipts so that they can be reimbursed for these expenses, as applicable. For Phase Two, subjects will be paid $10/hour, not to exceed $70 for the baseline-screening visit. They will receive $50 per visit for all remaining visits for a possible of 7 visits or $350  (i.e., infusion 1, 24-hour follow-up, 7-day follow-up, 14-day follow-up/infusion 2, 24-hour follow-up, 7-day follow-up, 14-day follow-up) and will be reimbursed for transportation based on mileage or receipts provided up to $50 per visit. Payments for this study are processed through Yale University.  As such, participants’ names, addresess and social security numbers will be provided to the Yale University Accounts Payable department in order to process subject payment for participating in this study.  Participants may be asked to complete a W-9 form (federal request for taxpayer identification and certification), which allows Yale to process their payment and potentially report their earnings to the IRS. Payment may be made to participants in cash on the day of each visit, at the discretion of the PI. For any cash payments, participants will be asked to sign a receipt acknowledging payment and the amount they were given. Most participants will receive payments in the form of a check or through Yale University’s debit card system. The debit cards will be offered through the YCCI OnCore ePayments system and will be our preferred payment option. Subjects will be informed that they will receive payment via a Bank of America pre-paid debit card.  We will provide their name, address, and telephone number to the Bank of America for processing and their card will be related to their name [CONTACT_114040].  Their SSN or other information will not be provided. All compensation information will be discussed in the informed consent process.  Yale will also send subjects an IRS 1099 form reporting the amount of money paid to them.    For Phase Three, subjects will be paid $10/hour, not to exceed $70 for the baseline-screening visit. They will receive $50 per visit for all remaining visits for a possible of 6 visits or $300  (i.e., infusion 1, 24-hour follow-up, 7-day follow-up, 14-day follow-up, 21-day follow-up, 28-day follow-up). At the principal investigator's discretion, further subject payment may be made for travel, parking, lodging, food, or transportation. Payment will be received through the mail in the form of a check from the VA, unless participants have arranged for direct deposit through the VA. Payment by [CONTACT_542984] [ADDRESS_708655] to withholding for outstanding debts; for 
  3/29/[ADDRESS_708656] any federal debt, there is a possibility that they will not receive any money after their participation. There will be no charge to participants for any aspects of this study including services, testing, evaluation, or medications. However, some Veterans are required to pay a co-payment for medical and other services provided by [CONTACT_542985]. These co-pay requirements will continue to apply to medical care and services provided by [CONTACT_376082]. Data Analysis:  This study, investigating the impact of sirolimus on ketamine’s rapid antidepressant effects, is the first of its kind.  In order to assess study utility and to determine if medication dose adjustments may be useful, we plan to do interim analyses after completion of the first 6 subjects, with subjects randomized according to block randomization (block of six). We propose to study [ADDRESS_708657] and will provide 80% power for detecting ketamine-sirolimus interaction effects of moderate size (d’=.53), assuming a two-tailed alpha=.05. The data analysis plan is provided only for the primary outcome variable, the MADRS score.  The normality of the data will be tested initially using probability plots and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests.  These data are frequently skewed and so we plan to analyze them using a non-parametric approach to repeated measures data.[ADDRESS_708658] ranked and then fitted with a mixed-effects model with an unstructured variance-covariance matrix and p values adjusted for ANOVA-type statistics.  In these models sirolimus (active vs. placebo) and time will be fitted as within subjects variables.  All interactions will be fitted.  Age and sex will be treated as covariates/groupi[INVESTIGATOR_173326]. Post-hoc analyses will be conducted to interpret interactive effects significant at the p=0.[ADDRESS_708659] will be used as the clustering variable. Plasma ketamine and ketamine metabolite levels will be analyzed using linear mixed models. All secondary measures will be assessed using similar methodology. Behavioral measures of Phase 3 will use similar methodology. The collection, processing and analysis of peripheral inflammatory biomarkers will be completed under a separate protocol and consent (i.e., CA0008).  IX. POTENTIAL RISKS: Although precautions will be taken to minimize risk to participants, some risks and inconveniences remain. The risks and inconveniences involved with this study include those associated with: (a) ketamine administration, (b) sirolimus administration, (c) phlebotomy and intravenous line placement, (d) psychiatric and cognitive evaluation to include clinical and neuropsychological assessments, (e) clinical deterioration, (f) ECG, (g) HIV and Hepatitis testing, and (h) pregnancy and breast-feeding.   Ketamine Administration:  Ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic that has been used clinically since the late 1960s. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_542963], there is no clear and compelling evidence of long-term toxicity associated with ketamine administration in medically supervised settings. However, there are acute medical and neuropsychiatric sequelae that deserve special consideration. The ketamine doses employed in this study have been specifically selected to produce behavioral effects without significant sedation. At these doses, ketamine produces a transient alteration of consciousness including altered sensory processing, and thought processes. Initially, subjects frequently feel “drunk” and giddiness is common. As blood levels increase, blood pressure and heart rate increase moderately. 
  3/29/[ADDRESS_708660]. They can complete ratings scales testing memory without impairment, their rate of finger tappi[INVESTIGATOR_542964]. However, some individuals feel that they cannot control the experience and find it frightening. Vivid dreams and poor sleep quality after infusion of ketamine has also been reported, although dream content was not necessarily unusual and alterations in sleep were not reported on subsequent nights. The doses used in this protocol produce blood levels that are 1/6 to 1/[ADDRESS_708661] been mild and transient, with no evidence of any clinically significant or persistent adverse effects. Adverse events included nausea and vomiting, sedation, anxiety, hypotension, insomnia and nightmares and transient pain in the infusion arm.  Sirolimus Administration:  Sirolimus is a commonly prescribed immunosuppressant (maximum daily dose is 40 mg); FDA approved for prophylaxis of renal transplant rejection.  The limited administration and low dose proposed in this study was selected to yield efficacy but minimize side effects.51, 52 Short-term administration (i.e., a single 6 mg dose) is anticipated to have limited, if any, side effects. Potential side effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, stomach pain, headache, skin rash, and joint pain. Other adverse reactions related to treatment with sirolimus include: peripheral edema, hypertriglyceridemia, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, increased creatinine, fever, urinary tract infection, anemia, pain, thrombocytopenia, susceptibility to infection, lymphoma, and malignancy, hypersensitivity reactions, exfoliative dermatitis, angioedema, fluid accumulation and wound healing, proteinuria, interstitial lung disease, and increased risk of calcineurin inhibitor-induced hemolytic uremic syndrome/thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/thrombotic microangiopathy (HUS/TTP/TMA).  Also uncommon, but possible, is an allergic reaction to sirolimus. Signs of such a reaction include the acute onset of hives, difficulty breathing, swelling of the face lips, tongue, or throat. As described above, a trained physician and nurse will be in attendance throughout the drug administration and infusion to monitor subjects for any side effects or other adverse events.   Blood drawing & intravenous line placement:   For the intake appointment, a butterfly needle will be inserted into a vein to retrieve blood samples. The placement of a butterfly needle in the vein can be associated with bruising, infection, or clot formation. These risks are minimized by [CONTACT_542986]. Sometimes people also experience a feeling of lightheadedness during or following blood withdrawal.  Subjects will have no more than 8 ounces of blood drawn. Blood samples are drawn for routine labs and drug screening.  
  3/29/[ADDRESS_708662] air bubbles going through the pump and stops infusion.    Risks associated with blood loss are minimal. Less than 200 mL will be drawn, and this represents 40% of a 500 mL blood donation.  Psychiatric Screening and evaluation: The risks and discomforts of the screening and evaluations are minimal. The discomfort associated with the physical examination or intake interview with the study clinician includes the possible stress of answering personal questions. Subjects will be answering questions about their symptoms and filling out questionnaires. They may find this process to be inconvenient, uncomfortable or upsetting. The psychological testing may include personal questions about previous experiences. The questions will be asked in a private room. Subjects will be informed that they do not have to answer any question that they do not want to answer. Subjects will also have the option to discuss their concerns with someone on the research staff. One or more individuals will be available to talk to the subjects should they become distressed during an interview or while filling out questionnaires. The cognitive testing portion may be frustrating or boring for some subjects, yet it shown to be well tolerated.    Clinical Deterioration: There is a risk of increasing depressive symptoms due to the natural history of the illness and/or poor response to ketamine and sirolimus administration. ECG: Sometimes the adhesive pads used to attach the leads for recording the electrical activity of the heart (ECG) can cause skin irritation. Such irritation usually clears without treatment. HIV, Hepatitis B and C testing: as part of the screening assessment, may yield information that we are legally required to disclose to the State of Connecticut and/or CDC as reportable infections. Any identifiable information obtained in connection with this protocol remains confidential. Information is disclosed only with the subject's prior authorization or as required by U.S. and State law. Information that we are legally required to disclose includes abuse of a child or elderly person, or certain reportable infectious disease.  Pregnancy and Breast Feeding:  Women will be tested for pregnancy as part of the routine laboratory tests the day of the screening appointment.  If the test is positive, the woman will not be included in the study. Before starting the study, we will ask women to avoid becoming pregnant and ask what precautions will be taken. We will ask that participants use contraception throughout the duration of the study and for 12 weeks following the study. We ask that they agree to use an approved birth control method including oral, injectable, or implant birth control, condom, diaphragm with spermicide, intrauterine device, tubal ligation, abstinence, or partner with vasectomy) or if post-menopausal for at least 1 year, or surgically sterile. If they are taking a contraceptive medication, we ask that they also use (or ask that their partner use) a barrier method contraceptive (e.g, condom, diaphragm with spermicide).  If the participant changes her mind about becoming pregnant or how to avoid becoming pregnant, we ask that she tell us immediately.  
  3/29/18   Page 23  In addition, women who are breastfeeding will be excluded. Urine pregnancy testing will be completed prior to each infusion.   MINIMIZING RISKS  General risk-minimizing strategies: (1) Effective screening to exclude subjects who would be placed at a greater risk. This includes a comprehensive psychiatric and medical evaluation, physical examination, and the screening studies performed before starting studies (see above). Trained staff, under the supervision of the PI, will conduct all screening procedures. (2) The investigator or a designated person will explain the benefits and risks of participation in the study to each subject. Subjects will be asked to verbalize their understanding of all aspects of the consent, including risks, benefit and alternatives. The voluntary nature of research studies is always emphasized. (3) All subject information will be kept confidential and only members of the investigative team with appropriate IRB/HIC and HIPAA training will have access to the study data. Data will be maintained and secured in locked file cabinets or password protected electronic media. A numbering code will be used to assign a unique identifier to each subject. (4) A Data and Safety Monitoring Plan is described below. Ketamine Effects: As noted above, our group here at the VACHS and Yale pi[INVESTIGATOR_542965], and has been performing these studies since early 1990s. Before participating, subjects undergo careful psychiatric and medical evaluation. A research nurse and study physician are available at all times during test sessions to provide support and consistent “reality testing” for individuals experiencing confusion or transient psychosis. If a subject reports that symptoms cannot be tolerated, the ketamine infusion will be stopped. Subjects will be observed for at least an hour after the termination of testing, and if intolerable physical or behavioral symptoms persist, subjects may be admitted to the inpatient Clinical Neuroscience Research Unit at the Connecticut Mental Health Center for further observation and overnight if necessary. Participants will be informed that they may not drive or operate machinery for [ADDRESS_708663] (24 hours/day) should unpleasant effects occur after subjects have left the testing facility. Medication effects will be reviewed and “debriefed” with subjects following each test day by a study clinician. If necessary, subjects will be administered oral diazepam to reduce residual symptoms and their participation in the study will be terminated if necessary. Such subjects will be monitored as found appropriate by [CONTACT_15490]. We are also taking a number of precautions to help reduce the chance of having an unpleasant response to ketamine or to reduce the severity of any lingering medication effects. These precautions include: 1) A research clinician will be present throughout the study to offer support and to help clarify the progress of the test day in case the medication causes feelings of confusion.  2) Medications are available (IV lorazepam) to relieve distress related to the behavioral effects of ketamine.  3) We will ask the subject to remain at the VACHCS in a recovery room for several 
  3/29/[ADDRESS_708664] is feeling well before discharge to home.  4) We will review the test day with the subject to deal with their feelings and reactions to each test day before they leave.  5) We will ask the subject to contact [CONTACT_542987].  6) We will ask the subject not to engage in demanding work in the day following the test sessions and we will work with the subject to schedule your test days accordingly.  7) If the subject has any lingering medication effects, such as sedation, we will terminate the remaining test days and work with him/her until these side effects have resolved.  8)  If the subject develops psychiatric symptoms, we may admit him/her to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. This may be involuntary if he/her are in danger of harming self or others.  9) We will conduct 24-hour, 7-day, 14-day, and 28-day follow-up assessments for residual effects.   Clinical Deterioration: Subjects will be closely monitored with serial depression rating scales. In the event of clinical deterioration, the subject will be discharged from the study protocols and the study physicians will initiate treatment as clinically recommended. As noted above, the following are objective criteria for acute decompensation: (1) a 25% increase in MADRS scores at any time during the study, or (2) the onset of active suicidality as assessed by [CONTACT_542983] 5 or more on the item-10 of MADRS. Study participants will be informed that a decision to initiate standardized psychotropic and/or psychotherapeutic regimens will not adversely affect their ability to participate in future protocols or receive treatment at VACHS, Yale Depression Research Program (YDRP), CMHC, or private psychiatric practice in the community. All participants will be treated by a study physician until appropriate referral is arranged. IV Irritation:  If there is irritation due to IV blood sampling, the physician present during the study will examine the subject, and the study will be terminated if the subject is in pain. Data Safety Monitoring Plan:  An independent data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) will be established for the clinical trial (i.e., phase 1 & 2, not the mechanistic phase 3 study). The investigator’s assessment of the overall risk for subjects participating in this study is moderate. Moderate Risk DSMP 1. Personnel responsible for the safety review and its frequency: 
  3/29/[ADDRESS_708665] be conducted at a minimum of every 6 months (including when reapproval of the protocol is sought). During the review process, the principal investigator (monitor) will evaluate whether the study should continue unchanged, require modification/amendment, continue or close to enrollment. Furthermore, a data and safety monitoring committee (DSMC) of independent researchers/clinicians (including an ethicist and statistician) will review adverse advents. The DSMC committee will review the study prior to the initiation of Phase One subject enrollment. The DSMC will be consulted again prior to Phase Two of the study, at which point the committee members will determine whether this study can be safely conducted on an outpatient basis. In addition, the DSMC will conduct a safety assessment twice yearly. Either the principal investigator, the DSMB  (Phase 1 & 2), or the VA IRB have the authority to stop or suspend the study or require modifications. 2. The risks associated with the current study are deemed moderate for the following reasons:  1. We do not view the risks associated with ketamine infusion and sirolimus dosing as minimal.  2. Given the established safety and validity of the use of ketamine and sirolimus, we do not view the proposed study as high risk. Although we have assessed the proposed study as one of moderate risk, the potential exists for anticipated and/or unanticipated adverse events, serious or otherwise, to occur since it is not possible to predict with certainty the absolute risk in any given individual or in advance of first-hand experience with the proposed study methods. In order to assess safety in this patient group, we will conduct an interim data analysis after the first 5 subjects are completed. Therefore, we provide a plan for monitoring the data and safety of the proposed study as follows:  3. Attribution of Adverse Events: Adverse events will be monitored for each subject participating in the study and attributed to the study procedures / design according to the following categories: a. Definite: Adverse event is clearly related to investigational procedures(s)/agent(s). b. Probable: Adverse event is likely related to investigational procedures(s)/agent(s). c. Possible: Adverse event may be related to investigational procedures(s)/agent(s). d. Unlikely: Adverse event is likely not to be related to the investigational procedures(s)/agent(s). e. Unrelated: Adverse event is clearly not related to investigational procedures(s)/agent(s). 4. Plan for Grading Adverse Events: The following scale will be used in grading the severity of adverse events noted during the study: 1. Mild adverse event 2. Moderate adverse event 3. Severe

Plan for Determining Seriousness of Adverse Events:  Serious Adverse Events: In addition to grading the adverse event, adverse events are evaluated to determine whether they meet the criteria for a Serious Adverse Event (SAE). An adverse event is considered serious if it: 1. is life-threatening 2. results in in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 3. results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity 4. results in a congenital anomaly or birth defect OR 5. results in death 6. based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject’s health and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in this definition, or 7. adversely affects the risk/benefit ratio of the study An adverse event may be graded as severe but still not meet the criteria for a Serious Adverse Event. Similarly, an adverse event may be graded as moderate but still meet the criteria for an SAE. It is important for the PI [INVESTIGATOR_22415] “seriousness” when determining whether reporting to the IRBs is necessary. 6. Plan for reporting serious AND unanticipated AND related adverse events, anticipated adverse events occurring at a greater frequency than expected, and other unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others to the IRBs The investigator will report the following types of adverse events to the IRBs: a) serious AND unanticipated events; b) adverse events occurring with a greater frequency than expected; and c) other unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others. These adverse events or unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others will be reported to the IRBs and DSMB (Phase 1 & 2) within 48 hours of it becoming known to the investigator, using the appropriate forms.  7. Plan for reporting adverse events to co-investigators on the study, funding and regulatory agencies For the current study, the following individuals, funding, and/or regulatory agencies will be notified: • All Co-Investigators listed on the protocol. • DSMB (Phase 1 & 2) The principal investigator, Chadi Abdallah M.D., will conduct a review of all adverse events upon completion of every study subject. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_170554].

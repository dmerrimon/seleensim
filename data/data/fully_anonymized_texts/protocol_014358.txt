1 STUDY SUMMARY  
1.1 Synopsis  
Title:  Aerosol Biocontainment Device  (ABCD) with Aerosol Clearance for Aerosol 
Generating Procedures  
Short Title:  Aerosol BioC ontainment Device  (ABCD)  
Study Description :  The primary goal of this study is to assess use of a  biocontainment device for  planned  
airway procedures under general anesthesia .  This will  serve as a platform  for using 
this device  as a novel biocontainment and aerosol evacuation system as part of rapid 
sequence intubation protocols for COVID -[ADDRESS_1136921] procedures  without the device .  
Objectives:  The primary objectives of this study are: 1) Assess changes in airway procedure  time 
with and without the biocontainment device  as a function of repeated utilization and as 
a function of patient -associated airway  factors (i .e. Mallampati score, hyomental 
distance, neck mobility, BMI) and user -associated airway  factors (i .e. experience of 
user, airway device used , induction sequence)  2) Assess adverse events, adverse 
device events  associated with biocontainment device use.  
Secondary objectives include: 1) Assess the subject’s comfort with using the 
biocontainment device .  2) Assess for additional healthcare and cognitive burden 
imposed by [CONTACT_8121].  3) Survey of patient’s post -procedure on experience being 
inside the device.  Exploratory  objective s include  gathering specific feedback regarding 
possible design modifications for further iterations and design improvements with the 
engineering team.  
Primary 
Endpoint:  The primary endpoints of this study are:  
1. Measuring the t ime for performing an airway procedure  with the biocontainment 
device  when accounting for patien t and user -specific factors . 
2. Quantifying the number of AEs or ADEs over time to assess device safety.   
Secondary 
Endpoints:  The secondary endpoints include:

[ADDRESS_1136924] (touching infected surface and inoculating nose  with virus), 
droplet (spray of droplets from an infected person onto another person – usually gets into upper airway but not 
deeper into the lungs) , and aerosol ( uptake of particles 10 -100 microns into the upper airways (nose, sinuses), and 
direct uptake into the lungs of particles under 5 -10 microns in size )1.  The titer of SARS -CoV2 and duration of 
exposure necessary to infect a person by [CONTACT_820282], contact, or aerosol exposure  is currently unknown.  Viral 
 
  
Protocol # 843373  Aerosol Biocontainment Device (ABCD)  
Version date: 10/2 3/[ADDRESS_1136925] could contain higher viral loads .  There is also evidence that aerosol 
can lead to gross contamination of surfaces with the virus , which can also increase the risk of disease spread3.  
There is evidence from the prior SARS and MERS outbreak s of aerosol transmission of disease as well as 
evidence of transmission during aerosol generating procedures4,5. There is evidence from SARS and MERS 
outbreaks as well as emerging evidence from the current COVID -19 pandemic that physicians who perform 
aerosol generating procedures and those present at the time of the procedure ar e at high risk for contracting the 
disease4-7.  Aerosol generated from SARS -CoV2 (the virus causing COVID -19) remains viable in the air for at 
least three  hours a nd based on the half -life of virus in aerosol  (one hour) , there is likely viability for at least six  
hours in a static environment8.   Aerosol clearance from a room is highly dependent on the number of air changes 
per hour (ACH), which varies from location to location within and across hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600].  There are minimum standard s 
for air changes per hour , with operating rooms te nding to have the highest number of ACH  (10-15).  The location 
of the air exchange vents and air handlers relative to the patient position as well as the size of the room , patient 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_820246] a role 
in the rate of aerosol clearance.  
Aerosol generating procedures include: intubation, extubation, non-invasive positive pressure support (CPAP, 
BiPAP), open suctioning of any patient with a breathing tube (either endotracheal tube or tracheostomy – done 
multiple times a day per patient), delivering nebulizer treatments to patients, head and neck procedures involving 
the nose, mouth or throat, bronchoscopy, and any delivery of oxygen over [ADDRESS_1136926] designed and built a  biocontainment device  (Figure 1 ) that will isolate the patients head and up to the 
level of the shoulders  (Figure 2 ) and contain droplets  and aerosol  while also allowing healthcare workers to safely 
 
  
Protocol # 843373  Aerosol Biocontainment Device (ABCD)  
Version date: 10/2 3/2020  Page 11 of 41 
 
 
perform aerosol generating procedures  (i.e. intubate, extubate, deliver a nebulizer treatment or suction a patient ).  
The device has additional hand ports on both sides for an assistant to safely help the primary proceduralist.  There 
are also dedicated ports for lines or wires associated with equipment needed for aerosol generating procedures 
and the hand and instrument ports self -seal after removal of arms or instrument, respectively.  The device will 
have the ability to clear suction which is currently under going additional rigorous testing in a laboratory setting.  
The goal is to have the capability in place to  use hospi[INVESTIGATOR_820247] e room or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_789469].  
 
 
 
Bench Data of Aerosol Evacuation and Suctioning Requirements  
Particles under 100 microns are considered in the size range for infectious aerosol, however, particles in the single 
micron range will stay suspended for several minutes whereas particles in the 100s of nanometer and smaller 
range are considered small enough to “ride” the airflow and have a residence time well above te ns of minutes.  
Coronavirus is on the order of 100  nm in diameter and exhalation of air from an infected patient could carry 
coronavirus on the water vapor exhaled with each breath .  This condition of water vapor movement was used as 
an estimate for corona virus flow in the air in a computational fluid dynamic model of virus flow from a patient’s 
mouth assuming a baseline condition of quiet breathing (approximate airflow rate of 10 L/min ).  Airflow and 
concentration of the flow of water vapor (virus)  were me asured from a “patient” in  an operating room setting 
assuming 10 air changes per hour and a room size of 6 m x 6 m x 3.5 m ( Figure 3A ).  As seen in this figure, with 
10 air changes per hour, the majority of the room remains safe, however, there is a danger space of approximately 
1meter (~3 feet) around the patient’s head where a healthcare worker would be exposed to high levels of aerosol 
(Figure 3A ).  Placement of the biocontainment device around the patient’s head will help to contain these airborne  
particles within the device ( Figure 3B ), and enabling suction from the top of the unit approximately over the 
patients mouth at an airflow rate of 100 L/min (airflow rate from HUP wall suction), will create a streamlined 
movement of aerosol from the patie nt’s mouth out of the device ( Figure 3C ), effectively containing and 
evacuating contaminated aerosol.  Utilizing the suction continuously during the procedure will provide this 
streamlined movement of air and will help pull aerosol away from the healthcare  provider during the procedure.  
There is an added benefit that this will also reduce the risk of device fogging during the procedure.

Following completion of  an aerosol 
generating procedure, t he amount of time 
required to evacuate aerosol was calculated 
based on the volume of the biocontainment 
tent (~ 105 Liters), assuming minimal further 
aerosol generation and that there is a well -
mixed environment in the device.  Figure [ADDRESS_1136927]  (suction) flow rate and amount of 
time required to remove 95% or 99% of 
aerosol.   As seen in Table  1, wall suction 
rates between 50 -100 L/min will be able to 
remove 99% of aerosol between 4.[ADDRESS_1136928] -procedure.  Reducing the 
volume of the biocontainment device is an 
important factor that allows for more 
efficient clearance of aerosol and 
minimization of the amount of 
time the device needs to stay on a 
patient.  
We assessed  droplet containment 
by [CONTACT_648587] a fluorescein 
solution inside the device onto the in ner aspects of the device frame, to rso drapes and hand/instrument ports.  
The device appeared to contain all obvious gross droplet contamination ( Figure 5).

and could be easily lifted up by [CONTACT_820283] a patient.  
Assembly of the device took about 1 minute for 2 people to perform with 
the patient supi[INVESTIGATOR_340639].  Assembly of the device could be performed 
by [CONTACT_820284]  2 minutes with the patient completely supi[INVESTIGATOR_050].   
The device can be secured safely to an operating room table, stretcher , or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/ICU bed.  With the safety straps in place, the device remains 
secure with the head elevated up to [ADDRESS_1136930].  
Based on the average length of a person’s arm from fingertip to elbow (~ 18 inches),  and ergonomic positio ning 
to achieve right angles of the forearm at the elbows,  the distance between arm ports should be farther apart than 
10 inches.  To accommodate wider positioning without over -extending the overall width of the device (currently 
23 inches), the arm ports were positioned [ADDRESS_1136931] around a patient .  The 
goal of the study is to refine device protocols and labelli ng to provide  frontline healthcare workers added 
protection with an effective biocontainment and aerosol evacuation device.

patient while inside the device.  This device does not contain a power source/electricity.  This device has 
dedicated ports and flaps to accommodate instruments, cor ds or tubing required to perform the aerosol 
generating procedure.   The device has the ability to connect to a suction system to evacuate aerosol contained 
within the device.  This portion is still undergoing additional lab -based testing and suction set -up will be for 
simulation purposes only for this trial.  
2.2.2  Clinical Adverse Event Profile  
Anticipated adverse events  (AEs) or adverse device effects (ADEs)  associated with use of this device include, 
1) injury to the patient subject  (patient  in ABCD ) or user  subject  (healthcare provider), 2) patient subject 
claustrophobia. 3)  patient subject anxiety, 4) difficulty performing intubation with or without requiring removal 
of the device. Serious adverse events (SAEs) or serious adverse device effects (SADEs) would include 1) major 
injury to the patient or provider. Unanticipated adverse device events (UADEs) would include device 
breakdown .  Based on the pre-clinical simulations  (intubation and CPR) , there is a low risk of increased 
technical difficulty during intubation  and the device remains firmly in place during chest compressions for CPR . 
There is minimal anticipated risk , as noted above,  to the user subject or patient subject .  The device will remain 
on a patient for the duration of an aerosol generating procedure and then for a defined  period  post-procedure to 
simulate aerosol evacua tion. 
2.3 Risk/Benefit Assessment  
2.3.1  Known Potential Risks  
Immediate Risks : There is  still a risk of droplet or aerosol exposure to infectious agents , such as SARS -CoV2 
(the virus causing COVID -19) with this device.  This device does not eliminate that risk and does not replace 
current CDC guidelines for PPE during an aerosol generating procedu re, proper donning , and doffing of PPE 
and hand hygiene .  This device is intended for use in addition to  recommended PPE during an aerosol 
generating procedure.   Additional bench testing is ongoing to assess the efficacy of the device in containing 
aerosol  and limiting aerosol escape.   
There is a risk of device failure due to improper set-up or use of the device.  There may be an increase in 
cognitive burden as a result of introduction of a new form of PPE which has been suggested previously as a 
source of  risk in aerosol generating procedures12.  The weight of the device is 9 lbs and there is minimal risk o f

injury to the user or the patient  during setup and use with  the device.   All training material (written and 
audiovisual) must be reviewed and the initial survey completed prior to initiating use of the device.  
There may be some variability in user comfort performing an intubation with this device.   Based on our 
simulations and completion of the necessary training, there is  likely to be  minimal risk of a qualified user 
having device -related issues with intubation.  In the event that the user feels th e device is impairing their ability 
to safely intubate the patient, the device can be quickly  removed by [CONTACT_820286].  
There is a risk of con tamination from the device during removal of the device from the patient. PPE should be 
worn during removal and cleaning/disposal of the device.  
There is a small risk of claustrophobia or anxiety for those patients in the device. This is a likely to be a 
minimal risk and this will be assessed as part of this study.  All patients will be monitored while in the device 
and if they request to be taken out of the device or display signs of increasing anxiety/claustrophobia, the device 
will be removed.  
Long -range  Risks : There is a risk of device failure over time.  Specifically, failure at seams , hand  port 
septums, or straps.  The integrity of the device should be assessed after each use and any obvious defects should 
be documented and the device removed from use.   The free plastic sheeting over the torso will be disposable to 
reduce risks of cleaning a large plastic sheet and risks of the sheet developi[INVESTIGATOR_820250] .  The device should be inspected after use for a ny physical tears  or breaks in the 
frame or  in the canopy and stored such that physical damage is limited .  Parallel testing will also be ongoing in 
the lab setting with the engineering team as an added layer of assessing device durability, biocontainment and 
aerosol evacuation to get a complete pi[INVESTIGATOR_820251] a clinical use and engineering perspective on the number 
of times the device can be used reliably for biocontainment and aerosol evacuation.  
2.3.2  Known Potential Benefits  
Immediate Potential Benefits : This device offers an immediate benefit of providing an additional physical 
barrier for added  protection of healthcare workers during aerosol generating procedures.  The self -sealing hand 
and instrument ports offer a modular approach for enhanced safety of a patient during an aerosol generating 
procedure by [CONTACT_820287], if needed , during an aerosol generating procedure.  Having a  
physical barrier in addition to standard PPE for aerosol generating procedures may also provide healthcare 
workers with an added layer of comfort  and protection  that they are better protected against contracting 
COVID -[ADDRESS_1136933] to performance of aeros ol generating procedures and this could improve the overall quality 
of the procedure.  
The option for continuous suction provides a benefit of continuous evacuation of aerosol from the device during 
a procedure.  This also offers the ability to clear contam inated air from the chamber after completion of an 
aerosol generating procedure to reduce the potential risk of spread of aerosol throughout the room and 
additional contamination of individuals and surfaces in the room.  
Long -range  Potential Benefits :  The multiple hand and instrument ports also allows this device to be utilized 
for additional aerosol -generating procedures beyond intubation such as extubation, delivery of a nebulizer 
treatment, and open suctioning of a tracheostomy for a COVID19 -treated pati ent.  It may be feasible to use this 
 
  
Protocol # 843373  Aerosol Biocontainment Device (ABCD)  
Version date: 10/2 3/[ADDRESS_1136934] equivalent to this device is a face  
shield worn by a healthcare worker , which would provide no added significant risk to a patient for any 
procedure.   This secondary “face  shield” is placed over the patient as an added layer of protection during high 
risk procedures for generation of aerosols.  Based on the results in Section [ADDRESS_1136935] procedures involvi ng general anesthesia to better assess the 
feasibility for using this device as part of aerosol -generating procedure  protocols for patients with highly 
transmissible (airborne or droplet) infectious diseases  (i.e. COVID -19). The benefits of this device are  
adding an additional layer of PPE protection for high risk aerosol generating procedures that has the potential to 
reduce risk of contracting COVID -19.  There is also a potential benefit of containment of infectious aerosols to 
reduce contamination of sur faces and equipment in rooms where aerosol generating procedures are performed 
which may help streamline patient care, workflow and sanitation procedures long -term.  
Risk of injury to a study subject  or patient  from this device is minimal.  The device is li ghtweight, sturdy with 
good optical clarity for performing aerosol generating procedures.  Below is a breakdown of major risk/failure 
points and steps taken to mitigate and assess risk  by [INVESTIGATOR_399025].  
Environment:  
1. Site or sub -site location for device use .  There is a future risk of non -uniform device use due to cultural 
and environmental differences among units and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_820252].   The initial 
study will involve two sites that are in close physical proximity, work closely together an d are part of 
the same health system  (HUP and PPMC ) which will help inform appropriate changes to the label/user 
manual for device use .   
2. Situation Urgency/Emergency : Extubation and delivery of a nebulizer treatment or suctioning are all 
accomplished in an  orderly and timely fashion.  Intubation, depending on the urgency requires a highly 
coordinated and efficient response and a new device may create another layer of risk by [CONTACT_820288].  The process for device utiliza tion will require  a work flow where 
the provider performing/assessing the need for intubation can understand the potential risks/benefits of 
proceeding with intubation.  The primary goal of this study is to assess use of the device for planned 
airway proce dures under general anesthesia  to better assess the feasibility for using this device as part of  
aerosol generating procedures  for COVID -19 patients .

People :   
1. Human Error :  Human error is the largest risk factor for proper use of the device.  Error in 
understanding device function, device setup , or aerosol evacuation could lead to a false sense of security 
in use of the device.  Improper device utilization also has a risk to cause harm to the study subject.  For 
this reason, there is a robust audiovisual a nd written/pi[INVESTIGATOR_820253] a plan 
for assessment of device training.  An additional goal of this study will be to assess number of device 
uses needed to obtain proficiency.   
2. Clinical Training and Experience : Study subjects will have a wide range of experience and training .  
The goal of this study is to involve stakeholders  with multiple years/levels of experience  in intubation  
procedures .  We intend to track outcomes based on these variables to assess for further ne eds for 
enhanced training, healthcare burden, and overall device utilization.  
3. Patient Risk:   There is a small risk of mild patient injury with the device as well as a mild risk of 
claustrophobia or anxiety to the patient in the device.  Patient injury  from  the device, small risk of 
abrasion or contusion if the patient sits up inside the device  is unlikely to occur , and would be a n 
adverse event if it were to occur.  The preclinical feasibility  indicates that the most technically 
challenging procedure of int ubation can be performed safely with this device.  All patients will be 
monitored while in the device and if they request to be taken out of the device or display signs of 
increasing anxiety/claustrophobia, the device will be removed.  
Materials:  
1. Supply Cha in: Failure to secure a reliable supply chain  for disposable elements of the device could result 
in inability to use device to fullest capacity and reduce effectiveness of protection against droplet and 
aerosol.  Goal is to ensure reliable inventory of dis posable components by [CONTACT_9377][INVESTIGATOR_820254], have an accurate estimate of need and burn rate for supplies and give 
manufacturing partner(s) adequate lead time for all components to be produced, shipped , and deployed 
in a timely fashion . 
Methods:  
1.  Device availability:   Each site/sub -site that is part of the study  will have a designated storage location 
for units and associated disposable equipment.  Given the restrictions on non -clinical staff in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_820255],  research coordinators/team members will not be onsite to bring equipment from storage to 
the room.  The study PIs or subIs or study users will bring the device and associated components to the 
room for the procedure.  
2. Inability  to perform intubation :  There is a small risk of inability to perform intubation with this device.  
The device has been d esigned to optimize hand positioning and mobility to triangulate the hands toward 
the patient’s airway.  The device safety straps have a quickly release function to rapi[INVESTIGATOR_820256] d ifficulty performing an 
intubation with the device in place.

Version date: 10/2 3/2020  Page 18 of 41 
 
 
Equipment:  
1. Device Failure :  Failure of the device is another potential source of risk.  Device failure comes in 
multiple forms including structural failure due to repetitive use, damage during tr ansport, damage during 
storage, manufacturing defects, damage during shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  The design of the device has been simplified 
extensively to reduce the number of potential moving parts and structural failure points.  The frame of 
the device also should not be susceptible to failure from repetitive cleaning over the course of the study 
period.  To track any issues with a device, each device will have a unique identifier number  that w ill be 
recorded on the Quality U se Survey with each device use.  D evices will  be inspected after being  cleaned 
prior to storage for any signs of failure .  The hand and instrument ports as well as the torso drape are 
additional point of device failure from repetitive use.  The  torso drape is a single use item  that can be 
easily disp osed of in a biohazard waste bin.  The hand ports, frame and siding will be monitored and if 
signs of device failure/breakdown, the device will be logged as broken and taken out of circulation.

Version date: 10/2 3/[ADDRESS_1136943] Storage and Stability  
The frame of the device will be stored in the designated storage area of the study site  when not in use.  Unused 
disposable suction tubing and torso drapi[INVESTIGATOR_820263].  The 
products are inert without moving parts or electronic components and will be stable for the duration of the 
study.  
6.2.4  Device Preparation , Use, Remova l and Cleaning  
Device Assembly : The biocontainment device should be brought into the room prior to the procedure.  
Additional materials needed include the torso drape and the suction tubing (one or two tubing packets will be 
required depending on distance form device to wall suction).  
The patient should be  in position  and secured properly per site protocol (i.e. with a safety strap with arms and 
legs appropriately positioned per protocol for procedures on an operating room table ).  Once this has occurred, 
the patient should be fully supi[INVESTIGATOR_820264] 0 -degrees.  The patient’s head and the foam 
headrest should be gently lifted and the biocontainment device base slid under the foam headrest such that the 
base is centered on the operating room table and squarely on the “head” portion of the operating room table.  
The primary operator holds the device in place, and secure s the front (head side)  safety strap  to the head of the  
bed.  The left and right straps should then be secured on each side of the bed .  Once the biocontainment device 
is secured, the torso drape should be applied and secured around the patient’s torso, leaving small air  holes 
around the patient’s arms and the side of the device.  To simulate use of the suction, t he suction tubing  should 
be secured to the suction port on top of the device on one end and the wall suction nozzle on the other end  and 
the wall suction should be turned on .   
Device Use :  The anesthesia team should then ensure they have all equipment needed for the airwa y procedure  
readily available.  The user team should then proceed with airway management  technique deemed medically 
appropriate by [CONTACT_24694].  Note, the ventilator tubing should come out the open torso side 
under the torso drape.  Ensu re that air vents around the arms remain open during this time to pull clean air into 
the biocontainment device.  All airway procedure  related equipment can be removed during this time.  
Device Removal : Following completion of procedure , the suction tubing should be disconnected from the wall 
and then from the device and disposed of in biohazard waste.  The torso drape should be removed carefully and 
disposed of in biohazard waste.  With two people and the patient flat at [ADDRESS_1136944] while the second person removes the safety strap from around the operating 
room table.  A second member of the procedure team  should gently hold the patient’s head and the foam 
headrest , as per standar d protocol for adjusting a sedated patient’s head,  and the first person should gently slide 
the device out from underneath the patient’s head.  The device should be placed gently out of the way for 
cleaning and storage.  
Device Cleaning :  Wearing gloves, th e outside of the biocontainment device should be wiped clean with an 
antiviral cleaning wipe (bleach or peroxide based).  The nylon strap should also be fully wiped down, rolled up 
and secured in a loop.  Attention should be given to carefully wipi[INVESTIGATOR_820265].  Following cleaning of the outside of the box, an antiviral wipe should then be used to 
carefully clean the inside of the box paying special attention to clean both layers of the inner aspect of the han d 
and instrument septums.   The device should be allowed to air  dry prior to storage and re -use.

[ADDRESS_1136950] Enrollment :  Anesthesiologists (attendings, fellows , residents) and CRNAs who perform airway 
procedures under general anesthesia will be screened and recruited to the study as described in Section [ADDRESS_1136951] phone number and email 
address, age, gender, years of experience, healthcare degree , and training level.  
 
  
Protocol # 843373  Aerosol Biocontainment Device (ABCD)  
Version date: 10/2 3/[ADDRESS_1136952]  Device Training :  User subjects will undergo training on use of the biocontainment device as 
described in the Device preparation, use cleaning and storage Section 6.2.[ADDRESS_1136953] Recruitment :  Patients who are undergoing airway procedures under general anesthesia who are 
assigned to the user subject’s usual case -load will be recruited on the day of the procedure for the study.  
Inclusion and exclusion criteria will be as described above in Section 5.  Recruitment will take place on the day 
of the  procedure as cases and assigned providers can shift at the last minute and this will help ensure enrollment 
efficiency for patient subjects in the study.  The on -site participation of the patient in the trial is limited to the 
actual scheduled procedure t hat includes an airway procedure under general anesthesia.  
Airway procedure  and patient  data collection:   Patient data and data from the anesthesia data record will be 
collected by [CONTACT_820294] -airway procedure.  As a result of social distancing and 
minimizing personnel due to COVID -19, it may not be possible to have a member of the research team present 
to observe and record data from each procedure.  The airway procedures will be recorded using a GoPro camera 
placed in a fixed position.  Data from the memory card will be transferred to an institutionally secured and 
managed network drive.  Device use data will be collected from the videos by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_261959].  This

8.3 Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
8.3.1  Definition s 
[IP_ADDRESS]   Adverse Event/Adverse D evice Effect  
An adverse event  (AE) or adverse device effect (ADE) is any untoward medical occurrence (sign, symptom, or 
experience) that develops or worsens in severity associated with the use of the biocontainment device, whether 
or not considered intervention related. Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should be regarded as adverse events.  A 
pre-existing condition should be recorded as an adverse event if the frequency, intensity or the character of the 
condition changes.  Abnormal results of the intervention are considered to be adverse events if the abnormality:  
o results in study withdrawal  
o is associated with a serious adverse event  
o is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
o leads to additional treatment or to further resource utilization (diagnostic tests/procedures)  
o is considered by [CONTACT_1372]  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Serious Adverse  Events (SAE)   
Adverse events are classified as serious or non -serious.   
A serious adverse event  is any AE that is:  
·  fatal 
·  life-threatening  
·  requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]  
·  results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
·  a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
·  an important medical event  
·  required intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage to participant or subject  
 
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, but are clearly of major 
clinical significance.  They may jeopardize the subject, an d may require intervention to prevent one of the other 
serious outcomes noted above.  For example, drug overdose or abuse, a seizure that did not result in inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or intensive treatment of bronchospasm in an emergency department would t ypi[INVESTIGATOR_48517].  
  
All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded as non-serious adverse 
events.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (UADE)  
An unanticipated adverse device effect ( UADE ) is any serious  adverse effect on health or safety, or any life -
threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not 
previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan o r application, or any 
other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of 
subjects.  
8.3.2  Classification of an Adverse Event  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Severity of Event  
 
 
  
Protocol # 843373  Aerosol Biocontainment Device (ABCD)  
Version date: 10/2 3/2020  Page 29 of 41 
 
 
Adverse events will be classified based on the defined grad ing system:  
- Mild: events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the participant’s daily activities  
- Moderate: events result in low level of inconvenience or cause some inference with functioning  
- Severe: events interrupt a participant’s us ual daily activity. Severe events are usually potentially life -
threatening or incapacitating. Please note, the term “severe” does not necessarily equate to “serious”.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Relationship to Study Intervention  
All adverse events (AEs) and ADEs  must have their relationship to the study device assessed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_820270]/her clinical judgment. The degree 
of certainty about causality will be graded using the categories below. In a clinical trial, the study product must 
always be considered.  
• Definitely Related – The AE /ADE  is known to occur with the device .  
• Probably Related – There is a reasonable possibility that the device caused the AE, or there is a temporal 
relationship between the device use and event. Reasonable possibility means that t here is evidence to 
suggest a causal relationship between the device and the AE/ADE.   
• Possibly Related - There is a possibility that the device caused the AE, or there is a temporal relationship 
between the device use and event. There is no evidence to su ggest a causal relationship between the 
device and the AE/ADE but an alternate etiology has not yet been e stablished.  
• Unrelated – There is not a reasonable possibility that the use of the device caused the event, there is no 
temporal relationship between t he use of the device and event onset, or an alternate etiology has been 
established.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Expectedness  
Expected adverse events associated with this study that will be tracked and reported include:  
1. Minor injury to the patient subject or provider  
2. Patient claustro phobia  
3. Patient anxiety  
4. Difficulty performing intubation with the device in place  
5. Need to remove the biocontainment device to safely perform intubation  
 
Potential SAEs associated with this study would include:  
1. Major  physical  injury to patient or provider  due to device failure.  
 
A UADE for this device would be breakdown or malfunction of the device during use.  
 
The Sponsor  medical director is responsible for determining whether an adverse event (AE) or ADE is expected 
or unexpected.   An AE  or ADE  will be cons idered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event 
is not consistent with the risk information listed in the Investigational Plan.

Version date: 10/2 3/2020  Page 30 of 41 
 
 
8.3.3  Time Period and Frequency for Event Assessment and Follow -Up 
 
Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_820295] 1.3 .  Participants will be monitored by [CONTACT_820296].  Any adverse events /ADEs are captured and shared with study PIs and the Sponsor.  AEs and 
SAEs will be assessed for daily and completeness of surveys (data integrity) will be assessed weekly . 
 
The investigator will seek information on adverse events by [CONTACT_105] -directive question ing. Adverse events may also 
be detected when they are volunteered by [CONTACT_820297] . Information on all adverse events 
will be recorded in the source documentation. To the extent possible, adverse events will be recorded as a 
diagnosis  and symptoms used to make the diagnosis recorded within the diagnosis event.  
 
As much as possible, each adverse event or follow -up information will be evaluated to determine:  
1. Severity grade ( as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS]  above ) 
2. Duration (start and  end dates)  
3. Relationship to the study treatment or process – (As described in Section [IP_ADDRESS]  above)  
4. Expectedness to study treatment or process – [Unexpected – if the event severity and/or frequency is not 
described in the investigator brochure (if a pplicable) or protocol].  
5. Action taken with respect to investigational device or process (none, permanently discontinued, 
unknown, not applicable)  
6. Whether the event is serious  
 
Once an adverse event is detected, it should be followed until its resolut ion or until it is judged to be permanent, 
and assessment should be made weekly  (or more frequently, if necessary) of any changes in severity, the 
suspected relationship to the study treatment, the interventions required to treat it, and the outcome.  
8.3.4  Adver se Event Reporting  
Reporting Period  
Adverse events will be reported from the time of informed consent until study completion.  
 
Investigator Reporting: Notifying the Study Sponsor  and via the Medical Director.  
 
Every SAE /UADE , regardless of suspected causality (e.g., relationship to study product(s)) must be reported to 
the medical director and sponsor within [ADDRESS_1136954] be reported to the Sp onsor as a 
follow -up to the original epi[INVESTIGATOR_5319] 24 hours of the investigator receiving the follow -up information. A 
SAE /UADE  considered completely unrelated to a previously reported one should be reported separately as a 
new event.  
 
Send the SAE report  to the Medical Director.  
 
New information regarding the SAE or UADE will be reported as it becomes available and in the same manner 
that the initial SAE (i.e. , MedWatch  form). The investigator must follow the event to resolution or until the 
event is deemed and documented irreversible, whichever is longer.  
 
Investigator Reporting: Local Reporting Requirements  
 
  
Protocol # 843373  Aerosol Biocontainment Device (ABCD)  
Version date: 10/2 3/2020  Page 31 of 41 
 
 
 
The investigator will report AEs /ADEs  and SAEs /UADES  to the I RB/EC of record and other local regulatory 
groups per the local requirements.   Additional reporting/requirements include: failure to obtain ICF , device 
recall/repair/disposal, change in risk determination, or FDA or IRB withdrawal of the study.  
8.3.[ADDRESS_1136955] include an assessment 
of whether there is a reasonable possibility that the biocontainment device  caused the event.  
New information regarding the SAE or UADE will be reported as it becomes available  and in the same manner 
that the initial SAE /UADE  (i.e. SAE form). All serious adverse events (SAEs) and UADEs will be followed 
until satisfactory resolution or until the site investigator deems the event to be chronic or the participant is 
stable. Other s upporting documentation of the event may be requested by [CONTACT_535474].  
The SAE  and UADE  reports along with the PI’s assessment are to be sent to the Sponsor medical director  
within [ADDRESS_1136956] (IRB)  per IRB policy.  The study 
sponsor is responsible for conducting an evaluation of an SAE/UADE  and shall report the results of such 
evaluation to all revi ewing IRBs and FDA as applicable .

Version date: 10/2 3/2020  Page 32 of 41 
 
 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint s: 
1. We hypothesize that the t ime to perform an airway pr ocedure with the biocontainment device will be 
equivalent to  time for airway procedure without the biocontainment device .  Alternatively, there will be 
prolonged airway procedures times with the device.   This endpoint will be analyzed every two weeks . 
 
2. We anticipate that the number of AEs or ADEs will be low and  will also decrease over time.   This 
endpoint will be analyzed on a weekly basis.  
Secondary Efficacy E ndpoints:  
1. We hypothesize that the median Likert ratings for User subject device comfort will be weighted 
toward “strongly agree”.  Alternatively, we will see ratings favoring “neutral” or “disagree” for user 
subject device comfort.  
2. We hypothesize that the median Likert ratings for User subject additional healthcare burden comfort 
will be weighted toward “strongly disagree”.  Altern atively, we will see ratings favoring “neutral” or 
“agree” on increased healthcare burden.  
3.  The median Likert ratings for the Patient Experience survey will be weighted toward minimal patient 
discomfort or anxiety.  Alternatively, we will see ratings fa voring increased patient discomfort or 
anxiety inside the device.  
3. We anticipate that the median Likert ratings of the patient experience post -survey will indicate overall 
good user comfort and low levels of anxiety or claustrophobia in the device.  
9.2 Samp le Size Determination    
 
Statistical calculations:  
Sample size (for unknown population size) was determined based upon a 95% confidence level (Z -score 1.96), 
standard deviation of 0.5, and a margin of error (confidence interval) of 10%. [ qualtrics.com/expe rience -
management/research/determine -sample -size] 
● Necessary Sample Size = ((Z -score)2 * StdDev*(1 -StdDev))/(margin of error)2 
○ ((1.96)2 * 0.5*(1 -0.5))/(0.1)2 =  
○ (3.8416 * 0.25)/(0.01)=  
○ 96.04  
○ At least [ADDRESS_1136958] 1 75 patients, and assuming a 10 -15% drop -out/screen failure  rate, plan to enroll at least 
150 patient subjects on a rolling basis during weeks 2 - 6 of the tr ial to evaluate the use of a novel 
biocontainment and aerosol evacuation system.   The study should be adequately powered to assess secondary 
endpoints.  Some of the sub -analyses may be underpowered depending on the characteristics of the recruited 
patient s. 
 
At defined intervals (see Section 1.3 Schema), we will perform interim analysis to determine changes to sample 
size based on subject drop out/withdrawal.

9.3 Populations for Analyses  
For this study, a per -protocol analysis dataset will be obtained. Participants  (user and patient subjects)  who 
complied with the protocol will be used to create a dataset. This population for analyses will in effect allow us 
to analyze outcomes related to the advantages and disadvantages of the protective devic e of interest. For 
example, the number of proceduralists who utilized the protective device , overall device utilization and 
perceived comfort level, added healthcare burden and training level with the device.  
9.4 Statistical Analyses  
9.4.1  General Approach  
Descripti ve statistics:  
● The number of subjects who utilized the protective device will be included; the level of experience and 
training of user subjects will be included . 
● Patient subject baseline demographics, co -morbidities, smoking status, and intubation -relate d factors 
will be included . 
● Objective data regarding total time for the airway procedure , number of intubation /LMA/extubation 
attempts,  airway device used (i.e.  intubation blade used and size of ETT ) will be included . 
● The user subjects comfort level for de vice use will be graded on a continuous scale, and the mean 
comfort level calculated as well as the range.  
● The patient subjects comfort level and experience in the device will be graded on a continuous scale, and 
the mean comfort/e xperience level calculat ed as well as the range.  
● Categories for various healthcare burdens will be provided as options for participants; the mean for most 
common burden will be identified; the percentage for each burden subtype will also be identified.  
 
Inferential Tests  
● A p-value of 0.05 and 95% confidence interval will be utilized when determining if the protective device 
results in an improvement in outcomes measures, i.e. a decrease in the number of COVID -19 cases by 
[CONTACT_4317].  
● Chi-square testing or ANOVA  will be used . 
 
Covariates will be collected on participants, including but not limited to subspecialty training, years of 
experience as a resident, fellow, or attending, as well as gender.  
 
Assumption of normality of data points will be determined using Q -Q plots. If there are limitations to 
performing assumptions of normality, then appropriate non -parametric corrections would be performed.  
9.4.2  Analysis of the Primary Efficacy Endpoint(s)  
 
Primary Endpoints:  
1.  Assessment of time to complete an  airway procedure with or without the biocontainment device.   The time is 
measured as a single quantitative measure at the end of the procedure.  The initial starting time (T0) is 
defined as “ time the mask is removed from the patient  just prior to initiati on of the airway procedure ”. End 
time (T1) is defined as the time that the airway procedure is completed with a secure airway  defined as the 
 
  
Protocol # 843373  Aerosol Biocontainment Device (ABCD)  
Version date: 10/2 3/[ADDRESS_1136959] circuit .  Data will be presented as median amount of time for 
a giv en procedure with or without the biocontainment device and statistical significance will be determined 
by [CONTACT_6484] (ANOVA).  Additionally, a multiple  regression model will be created using 
covariates of subject user experience, number of prior uses with the device, and patient specific factors (co -
morbid conditions, BMI, Mallampati score).  This will help determine the critical factors associated with 
time to use the device.  
 
 
2. The total number of AEs and ADEs will be presented.  This will be broken down by [CONTACT_820298].  
Logistic regression will be used to assess possible contributing factors to AEs or ADEs including subject 
user experience, airway procedure performed, pat ient-specific factors (BMI, co -morbid conditions, 
Mallampati score).  We anticipate a low number of AEs/ADEs and as such, statistically rigorous regression 
analyses may be limited by a low overall number of events.  
 
Statistical analyses will be performed o n all data points, however, a sub -analysis will be performed on 
participants without any missing data points.   
9.4.3  Analysis of the Secondary Endpoint(s)  
 
The secondary endpoints are not dependent on the primary endpoints.  
 
1. Device Use Survey questions that are  specific to the functioning of the device are collected as ordinal data 
on a Likert scale.  Data will be presented as the median value with standard deviation for individual 
question results.  Aggregate (summed) results for all questions will be also be a ssessed using the same 
methodology.  Statistical significance will be determined using Chi -square test. Sub -analysis will be 
performed based on user subject experience level.  
 
2. Device Use Survey questions that are specific to the healthcare burden associate d with the device are 
collected as ordinal data on a Likert scale.  Data will be presented as the median value with standard 
deviation for individual question results.  Aggregate (summed) results for all questions will be also be 
assessed using the same me thodology.  Statistical significance will be determined using Chi -square test. 
Sub-analysis will be performed based on user subject experience level.  
 
3. Patient experience survey results are collected as ordinal data on a Likert scale.  Data will be presente d as 
the median value with standard deviation for individual question results.  Aggregate (summed) results for all 
questions will be also be assessed using the same methodology.  Statistical significance will be determined 
using Chi -square test. Sub -analys is will be performed based on patient age, gender, co -morbid conditions, 
type of airway procedure performed.  
 
Statistical analyses will be performed on all data points, however, a sub -analysis will be performed on 
participants without any missing data poin ts.  
9.4.4  Safety Analyses  
Safety analyses is one of the primary endpoints and will be assessed as described in Section 9.4.2 .  Reporting of 
AEs, SAE, ADEs, UADEs is as described in Section 8.2 .

Version date: 10/2 3/2020  Page 35 of 41 
 
 
9.4.5  Planned Interim Analyses  
 
An interim analys is will be performed after 50% enrollment (approximately 4 weeks)  on primary and secondary 
outcomes .  If the total number of AEs or ADEs is trending upward over time, the study would be paused until 
further assessment of AE/ADEs by [CONTACT_820299] r qualified designee would be performed  as 
described in Section 8 .   
9.4.6  Sub-Group Analyses  
Primary and secondary endpoints will be analyzed in the context of gender (males versus females)  age, and co -
morbid conditions for patient subjects, and years of experi ence of the user subject . 
9.4.[ADDRESS_1136960] feedback o n the device 
from end users for iterative engineering and design improvement . Modifications to the device are not planned 
during the trial period, and device changes will be judged based upon continual assessment via user feedback  as 
described in the proto col above.

de-identified  data will be included in the informed consent . 
10.1.5  Safety Oversight  
Safety oversight will be under the direction of the Sponsor and medical director.  
 
  
Protocol # 843373  Aerosol Biocontainment Device (ABCD)  
Version date: 10/2 3/[ADDRESS_1136965] of the trial is in compliance 
with the currently approved protocol/amendment(s), with International Conference on Harmonisation Good 
Clinical Practice (ICH GCP), and with applic able regulatory requireme nt(s).  
10.1.7  Quality Assurance and Quality Control  
All monitoring and audits are to be performed according to ICH GCP E6(R2).  
Each clinical site will perform internal quality management of study conduct, data collection, documentation 
and comp letion. An individualized quality management plan will be developed to descri be a site’s quality 
management.  
Quality control (QC) procedures will be implemented beginning with the data entry system and data QC checks 
that will be run on the database will be generated . Any missing data or data anomalies will be communicated to 
the site(s) for clarification/resolution.   This will be accomplished by [CONTACT_820303].  
Following written Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), the monitors will verify that th e clinical trial is 
conducted and data are generated , and specimens are collected, documented (recorded), and reported in 
compliance with the protocol, International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice (ICH GCP), 
and applicable regulatory re quirements . 
The investigational site will provide direct access to all trial related sites, source data/documents, and reports for 
the purpose of monitoring and auditing by [CONTACT_456], and inspection by [CONTACT_3482].

[IP_ADDRESS]  Data Collection and Management Responsibilities  
Data collection is the responsibility of the clinical trial staff at the site under the supervision of the site 
investigator. The investigator is responsible for ensuring the accuracy, comple teness, legibility, and timeliness 
of the data reported.  
Hardcopi[INVESTIGATOR_820274], for each participant enrolled in the study.  Data recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF) 
derived from source documents should be consistent with the data re corded on the source documents.   All paper 
data/survey collection forms will be stored in a locked cabinet in a locked room with access only be qualified 
study personnel.  
Clinical and survey  data will be entered into a 21 CFR Part 11 -compliant electronic data capture system (EDC) 
that includes individual user account level password protection. This EDC (Velos version 9) supports 
programmable data entry vali dation rules and edit checks to identify data entry errors.  
All video recordings will be captured using a GoPro camera.  Data will be transferred from the flash storage 
card to a HIPAA -compliant server behind the Penn Medicine firewall.  Videos will be lab elled with the de -
identified unique patient ID number.  Original videos will be deleted from the flash storage device upon upload

to the server.  Videos will be analyzed with data points recorded in CTMS.  All videos will be deleted within 14 
days of downl oad to the server.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Study Records Retention  
Study documents should be retained for a minimum of [ADDRESS_1136967] approval of a marketing application 
in an International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) region and until there are no pending or contem plated 
marketing applications in an ICH region or until at least [ADDRESS_1136968] elapsed since the formal discontinuation 
of clinical development of the biocontainment device for aerosol generating procedures . These documents 
should be retained for a longer period, however, if required by [CONTACT_427]. No records will be destroyed 
without the written consent of the sponsor, if applicable. It is the responsibility of the sponsor to inform the 
investigator when these documents no longer need to be r etained.  
10.1.9  Protocol Deviations  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_303628], in 
particular:  
• Who deviated from the protocol  
• What was the deviation  
• When did the deviation occur  
• How did the deviation hap pen 
• What is the impact of the deviation  
• A root cause analysis of why the deviation occurred  
If the assessment is determined to be of limited impact (minor deviation), the documentation for this assessment 
and the outcome should be reported to the Sponsor at the time of annual report. Reporting to the IRB should 
follow specific local requirements.  
If the assessment results in a determination that any of the following are potentially affected, the deviation 
would be considered of significant impact:  
• having the potential to adversely affect subject safety; OR  
• increases risks to participants; OR  
• adversely affects the integrity of the data; OR  
• violates the rights and welfare of participants, OR  
• affects the subject’s willingness to participate in research .  
• there is a potential for an overall impact on the research that should be shared with the IRB for 
consideration and development of next best steps to address it  
10.1.[ADDRESS_1136969] approve all sharing of information/data prior to its occurrence . 
10.1.[ADDRESS_1136970] of this trial will be disclosed to the Sponsor and managed. 
 
  
Protocol # 843373  Aerosol Biocontainment Device (ABCD)  
Version date: 10/2 3/[ADDRESS_1136971] to subjects may be implemented immediately, provided the  
Sponsor and IRB/IEC is notified within 5 days.

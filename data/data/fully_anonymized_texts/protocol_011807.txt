A. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
A.[ADDRESS_1109085] leading cause of death in the 
[LOCATION_002] and worldwide.5 The prevalence of COPD  in the U nited States  Veteran population,  ranging from 
33%-43%, is approximately five -fold higher than among the general population of the [LOCATION_002].1, 2, 4 A two -
fold increase in risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_803382].6 Active smoking 
continues to be a significant risk factor for COPD in the Veteran population.7 Further, the prevalence of chronic 
lung disease  (i.e., COPD, asthma, and interstitial lung disease)  has steadily increased from 2003 to 2011  in VA 
care8 inferring that pulmonary disease  will continue to be a major health concern for the VA.  
A.2 Exercise performance is limited in COPD and largely attributed to dys pnea (breathlessness) and 
dynamic hyperinflation (air trappi[INVESTIGATOR_007]).9, 10  For a large number of patients, exercise is limited by [CONTACT_106461] a 
maximal amount of additional air that can be drawn into the lungs (inspi[INVESTIGATOR_594654]). Dynamic 
hyperinflation in the presence of expi[INVESTIGATOR_803383] a characteristic of COPD. Increasing respi[INVESTIGATOR_803384]. As a consequence, air becomes progressive ly retained 
in the lung (dynamic hyperinflation), and this is the primary cause of symptomatic breathlessness in COPD.11 
Skeletal muscle strength also limits exercise in COPD, and this is often the outcome of  severe detraining (i.e., 
use it or lose it) that develops in COPD patients.12 
 Exercise performance is the result of the interaction between intensity (power  output) and exercise 
duration. Exercise intensity is characteristically limited by [CONTACT_82917][INVESTIGATOR_14008] , which, in turn , can be 
compromised by [CONTACT_803400] . Our study is based on the observation  that 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_803385] , since breathing and walking coupling is less likely to vary 
at a simple  ratio (1 stride:1  breath) in patients with COPD . The key hypothesis we will test is that exercise on a 
slope  will permit higher intensity exercise without  increas ing respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]. This is important,  as intensity is a 
major driver of training benefit.  
A.[ADDRESS_1109086] 
been several pathways proposed that may mediate this coupling.17, 
20-22 Importantly, when rhythms are optimally coupled, energy 
expenditure is economize d.23, 24 Our work  demonstrate s that 
patients with COPD display an unvarying coupling pattern with very 
low ratios at a self -selected walking speed (e.g., 1 stride:1  breath ;  
Figure 2).[ADDRESS_1109087] expend more energy to fight the increased amount of work needed to move 
the body’s mass against gravity.26 Energy req uirements, amount of work, and muscle activation increase with 
steeper uphill slopes. At slope s greater than 0. 2%, the energy cost of walking becomes proportional to the 
slope .27 During uphill walking, self -selected speed decreases with increasing slope .28 This could be due to 
metabolic constraints and/or mechanical constraints that are altered during uphill walking.28-[ADDRESS_1109088] frequently used coupling 
frequency ratios ( strides:breath) from 17 
patients with COPD (black) and 23 control 
subjects (gray) while walking at a self -
selected walking speed.3 More patients with 
COPD use less complex ratios such as 1:1 
and 3:2. Patients with  COPD do not use 
higher ratios such as 4:1 and 5:1. These 
results are consistent under various walking 
speeds. NOTE: NC=no coupling

B.[ADDRESS_1109089] of walking on a slope  on energy 
expenditure and breathing and walking coupling in healthy young and 
healthy older adults. Ten healthy young adults ( Mean(SD): 22.5(1.1) 
years) and 10 healthy older adults (67.9(3.9) years) were asked to walk 
at their preferred walking speed on a treadmill that was either level (0%  
slope ) or slope d (10%  slope ). Energy expenditure, rating of perceived 
exertion, as well as breathing and walking coupling  ratios  were 
quan tified. Older adults walked at a slower speed uphill as c ompared to 
young adults . Uphill walking increased energy expenditure (p<0.001) 
and rating of perceived exertion (p<0.001) above level walking. 
Breathing and walking coupl ing ratios  became more variab le in older 
adults during uphill  walking as compared to level walking ( Figure 3 ).  
B.[ADDRESS_1109090] of slope  walking in patients with COPD. Previous focus, 
although limited, has been on downhill walking.32-34 Decline walking requires controlled, eccentric contractions 
of the lower -extremity musculature, considered a more stressful walking condition compared to level walking.35 
Eccentric muscle contractions lead to increased muscle damage, muscle soreness , and fatigue.36, 37 Recent 
research demonstrate s improvements in exercise capacity after a downhill walking program; howe ver, muscle 
soreness between training sessions was not measured and reported.32, [ADDRESS_1109091] gravity; however, this is done through concentric muscle 
contractions. For the most detrained individuals, this approach limits immediate effects of muscle damage, 
soreness, and fatigue, leading to increased confidence and efficacy in exercise performance.  
Other s trategies have been explored to permit tolerable exercise at higher intensity in COPD. Interval 
exercise, for example, has been shown to increase exercise duration,39, [ADDRESS_1109092] commonly on a 
treadmill, behavioral change, and educational and nutritional counseling components.48, 49 Rehabilitation 
improves exercise capacity primarily th rough muscle training; however, not all individuals benefit from 
rehabilitation.48, 50 -52 Rehabilitation (or exercise training) has a positive impact on strength, exe rcise tolerance 
(measured in a laboratory setting), dyspnea, self -efficacy, and health -related quality of life; rehabilitation, 
however, does not improve lung function.48, 49, 53 -56 Further, the activity levels of COPD patients are not 
consistently improved following conventional rehabilitation.50, 57 -59 Improving the effectiveness of pulmonary 
rehabilitation will improve the outcomes for participants. In addition, many of those referred to 
rehabilitation are unable to continue and do not report benefit. Improvin g one’s ability to participate in 
rehabilitation will increase the percentage of COPD patients for whom rehabilitation will be beneficial .  
C. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS  
C.1 Overall Design   
This study will utilize a cross -sectional design to determine if walking on a slope  1) result s in less dynamic 
hyperinflation , 2), improve s dyspnea , and 3) leads to more complex  coupling as compared to walking faster . 
The study will be completed over four visits.  A total of 25 patients  (aged 45 -80 years) with moderate to severe 
COPD will be enrolled in the study. Hereinafter the patients will be referred to as subjects. During visit 1, 
subjects  with moderate to severe COPD, recruited and consented from the Omaha VAMC pulmonary and 
general medicine clinics , will undergo a maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test under medical supervision.  
Only those that are cleared for  participation by a physician will be enrolled  into the study . Subjects , stratified by

experimental conditions . The second  visit a cardiopulmonary exercise 
test will be used to determine a set speed and slope that equates to 
70%-80% of peak work rate using VO 2 (volume of oxygen consumed). 
Specifically, the time course of work rate will be calculated from the 
cardiopulmonary exercise test . The  speed and slope  that corresponds 
to where 70%-80% of peak work rate  was identified will be used . After sufficient rest, an additional constant 
work rate test will be given using increases in speed with a level treadmill to determine the speed that elicits a 
VO [ADDRESS_1109093] and fourth visits, airflow, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697],  oximetry,  dynamic 
hyperinflation, and walking  cadence  will be recorded during the trials  at the speed /no slope  or speed/ slope  
determined in the previous visit . Speed or slope conditions will be randomized across visits. At the end of each 
trial, dyspnea rating will be recorded.  
C.2 Subjects, Sample Size, and Inclusion Criteria  
C.2.a Sample size justification : For this proposal, we are requesting funding to recruit and enroll a pi[INVESTIGATOR_803386] [ADDRESS_1109094] s are enrolled.  Subjects  will be stratified by [CONTACT_89309]  (Table 1). 
According to Omaha VAMC  patient numbers, more than 45,000 visits are documented  in the pulmonary clinics 
and other general health clinics  with over 2,000 pulmonary function tests yearly . We anticip ate recruiting 3-4 
subjects /month during months 3 -18. We anticipa te meet ing our enrollment  goal of 1-2 enrolled/month . 
C.2.b Inclusion and exclusion criteria:  Veterans  from all sex/gender, 
race, and ethnicity will be recruited. All subjects will undergo post -
bronchodilator spi[INVESTIGATOR_803387]. All subjects must have 
documented FEV 1/FVC ratio of <0.7 , and between 30% to 80% FEV 1% 
predicted  (Table 1).[ADDRESS_1109095] non-qualifying spi[INVESTIGATOR_038], they will 
not be screened further. Subjects with qualifying spi[INVESTIGATOR_803388]  (Figure 4) . Potential subjects must have a BMI of less 
than 35 kg/m2 and must be free from co -morbidities that may affect 
walking patterns (e.g., peripheral arterial disease, diabetes, low back 
pain). Subjects must also be free from other co -morbidities that may have 
confounding effects such as neurological  or musculoskele tal disease. 
Those that meet the initial eligibility criteria will undergo  a 
cardiopulmonary exercise test . Those that are cleared for participation by 
a physician will be enrolled  in the study  following informed consent . 
Based on the exercise test and the  pulmonary function test , subjects  will 
need to meet the following criteria for enrollment: have moderate to 
severe COPD  and have no other pulmonary or cardiac issues that will 
pose a safety hazard when participating in the laboratory treadmill trials.  
C.2.c Recruitment of subjects:  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_741216] a Pulmonary Clinic at the Omaha VAMC every Wednesday. 
During clinic, a member of her research team, will be present. When a subject that fits the preliminary inclusion 
criteria, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_803389]. The research team will also 
be allowed to recruit subjects  through Veteran communications such as newsletters and , by [CONTACT_803401],  with generic letters informing them of the study . 
C.3 Protocol – Common for all aims   
C.3.a Screening and eligibility  (VISIT 1) : All potential subjects will be consented and  begin screening  at the 
Omaha VAMC . Screening includes a comprehensive medical history and spi[INVESTIGATOR_328693]. Potential subjects 
that meet the initial screening criteria will undergo a cardiopulmonary exercise test administered at the Omaha 
VAMC . The Porszasz  treadmill protocol61 will be used.  This treadmill protocol provides a linear increase in 
work rate and is appropriate for testing those with a low exercise tolerance. Medical professionals will oversee 
this test with all safety precautions in place (e.g., 12-lead ECG, crash cart). Potential subjects that are cleared 
to participate by a physician will be enrolled.  
C.3.b VISIT 2 : Once eligibility is determined, subjects will come  to the Biomechanics Research Building  at the 
University of Nebraska at Omaha (VA -leased space) . They will complete a series of questionnaires  that will be 
used as covariates in the analysis . Health -related  quality of life and activity -related dyspnea will be assessed 
through the Chronic Respi[INVESTIGATOR_578419]62, 63 and SF -36.64 To assess severity of dyspnea, they Table 1. Stratification strateg y 60

will be asked to complete the modified British Medical Research Council Questionnaire.  To assess the impact 
COPD has on their everyday lif e, subjects will be asked to complete the COPD Assessment Tool.65 To 
determine work rate, t he time course of work rate (done against gravity)  from the Porszasz treadmill protocol 
will be calculated. The speed and slope  that corresponds to 70%-80% peak  work rate  will be used .  
Subjects will be outfitted with a face mask that covers their nose and mouth attached to a portable 
metabolic cart (K5, Cosmed [LOCATION_003], Inc., Chicago, IL). We previously have used this method to measure energy 
expenditure in COPD patients without reported adverse events. Resting heart rate , respi[INVESTIGATOR_109651] , and tidal 
volume  will be recorded  as well through this device . Subjects  will stand quietly for five minutes while energy 
expenditure is collected through the metabolic unit. Subjects will have a transcutaneous oximeter attached to 
their abductor pollicis brevis  (The Moxy Monitor System , Moxy, Minneapolis, MN ). Subjects will walk at t he 
speed and slope  that corresponds to 70%-80% peak work rate. Subjects will maintain this level of exercise for 
one minute. If fatigued, they will be instructed to stop. (As exercise time at 80% VO [ADDRESS_1109096] without difficulty.) After sufficient rest and the return 
of heart rate and respi[INVESTIGATOR_803390] [ADDRESS_1109097] will be asked to continue to exercise at this rate for 
one minute.  
C.3.c VISIT 3 : Within  seven days , subjects will return for their first experimental  visit. Subjects will be prepared 
for data collection by [CONTACT_6094] a form -fitting suit (i.e., wrestling singlet) and obtaining height  and body weight. 
Retro-reflective markers will be placed bilaterally on anatomical locations of the feet, legs, and hips  (Figure 5), 
in addition to 89 markers on the thorax and abdomen .66-69  Subjects will 
be outfitted with the portable metabolic cart and oximeter as in  the 
previous visit . One of t wo treadmill trials will be performed: 1) at the 
speed and 2) at the slope  +speed  determined in the previous visit. Trial 
order will be randomized among subjects  and across  visits  3 & 4 . For 
each trial, subjects will be asked to walk on a treadmill for up to  6 
minutes. Speed or slope  will be increased every 30 seconds and they will 
be asked to walk for one minute at that speed or slope . Once they reach 
the speed or slope  that was determined to be 70 %-80% of peak work 
rate, they will walk for an additional one minute. This procedure will allow 
for multiple data points for interpolation.  Immediately at the end of the 
trial, dyspnea will be assessed by [CONTACT_803402] .70 Dynamic hyperinflation 
will be assessed through motion capture of the thorax and abdomen 
(optoplethysmograph y).66-69 
C.3.d VISIT 4 : Within seven days, subjects will return for their last 
experimental visit.  Methods will be similar to C.3.c. Subjects will 
complete the treadmill trial that was not completed in Visit 3 , either the 
speed or the slope  trial. The treadmill trial will be administered in the same manner between both visits.  
C.4 Instrumentation and Data Processing Measures  (Table 2):  
C.4.a Questionnaires to be used as  covariates  
Chronic Respi[INVESTIGATOR_578419]:62, 63 A 20-item questionnaire in which items are scored from 1 
(most severe) to 7 (no  impairment). There are four subscale areas tested: dyspnea, fatigue, emotion, and 
mastery. In the dyspnea section, the subject is asked to recall the five most important activities that caused 
dyspnea over the past two weeks.  Items within each subsection can range from [ADDRESS_1109098] severe to no 
impairment.  A total score , as well as individual subscale scores , can be calculated.  
SF-36:[ADDRESS_1109099]’s perspective. The SF -36 
contains eight domains: physical functioning, role -physical, general health perceptions, vitality, social 
functioning, role -emotional , mental health , and health transition . Two composite scores result: physical health 
composite score and mental health composite score. Scores >50 indicate better physical or mental health than 
the mean and <50 indicate worse health. 22 
Modified British Medical Research Council Questionnaire:71-73 A five -level rating scale based on the patient’s 
perception of dyspn ea in daily activities.  Patient s rate their level of perception of dyspnea on 5 grades, from 0 
to 4. A grade of 0 reflects , “I only get breathless with strenuous exercise”; whereas a grade of 4 reflects “I am 
too breathless to leave the house” or “I am bre athless when dressing .”

8 questions and scores range from 1 -40. A

A score <[ADDRESS_1109101]; [ADDRESS_1109102]; >[ADDRESS_1109103]; and >[ADDRESS_1109104] on everyday life.  
C.4.b Aim 1: Identify differences in dynamic 
hyperinflation  and dyspnea  during speed v. 
slope walking.   
Dynamic hyperinflation:  Dynamic hyperinflation 
will be assessed through opto -plethysmography , 
an established method of computing lung 
volumes, including dynamic hype rinflation.66-69, 
74-84 Opto -plethysmography uses three -
dimensional motion capture information to 
determine lung volumes . The 3 -D coordinates of 
the 89 markers on the abdomen and thorax will 
be used to create a  representation of the  
surface of the trunk  (Motion Analysis Corp., Santa Rosa, CA; 120Hz) . The volume of the trunk enclosed by [CONTACT_803403] a custom computer code  (MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA ). Dynamic 
hyperinflation  will be considered to be present when end -expi[INVESTIGATOR_803391].75, 84 
Perceived dyspnea:70 Breathlessness will be measured based on a 0 to 10 -point Borg scale at the end of the 
treadmill trials.   
C.4.c Aim 2:  Compare differences in respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], oxygen uptake, and lung dead space from speed 
to slope walking.  
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]:  Respi[INVESTIGATOR_803392]. With custom 
computer code, the markers will be identified to model a sphere. The  volume of the sphere  will be recorded 
over time. As the volume increases and decreases, respi[INVESTIGATOR_803393] , and respi[INVESTIGATOR_803394].  
Oxygen uptake : Heart rate and p ulmonary gas exchange analysis will be recorded on a breath -by-breath basis  
(TrueOne2400; ParvoMedics, Sandy, Utah ). This will provide an accurate measure of  pulmonary gas 
exchange,  including oxygen uptake,  i.e. VO 2, in real -time. Steady -state VO 2 while  walking will be averaged  and 
normalized to standing metabolic rate . Heart rate is recorded via an interface with a Polar heart rate monitor 
and is synchronized to pulmonary gas exchange.  
Dead space : Tidal volume and expi[INVESTIGATOR_803395]. Partial pressure o f arterial carbon dioxide will be measured using a transcutaneous sensor ( The 
Moxy Monitor System , Moxy , Minneapolis, MN) . Dead space is equal to tidal volume multiplied by [CONTACT_803404] (PaCO 2) minus partial pressure of e xpi[INVESTIGATOR_307028] (PeCO 2) divided by 
[CONTACT_803405] 2. 
C.4.d Aim 3: Determine the complexity of  walking and breathing coupling  ratios  between speed v. 
slope walking.  
Coupling:  The laboratory is equipped with a 1 7-camera, digital motion capture system (Motion Analysis Corp., 
Santa Rosa, CA; 120Hz) to allow for collection of three -dimensional marker positions in real time. The marker 
position data will be analyzed using custom MATLAB code (MathWorks, Inc., Natick, M A) available in the 
laboratory. Data  will be  plotted to detect spi[INVESTIGATOR_803396]. Spi[INVESTIGATOR_803397]. A cubic spline will be used to interpolate the removed data 
points. All marker data are then normalized to the unit vector for comparison . 
Coupling is often quantified  as frequency coupling .85, 86 Frequency coupling refers to how many heel 
strikes occur within a single cycle of respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] (one inhalation to the next); it is usually counted in integer or 
half-integer ratios , measured us ing discrete relative phase. Discrete relative phase values between [ADDRESS_1109105] a 1:[ADDRESS_1109106] a 2:[ADDRESS_1109107] a 3:1 relationship, and so on. Half -
integer couplings (expressed as 3:2, 5:2, 7:2, etc.) exist when the frequency alternates between two integers.  
The range of ratios and the percentage of time each ratio is utilized will be recorded.   Table 2. Measures to be collected during the course of the study.

C.5 Statistical Analysis  
For sample size justification, please see section C.2.a. Demographic characteristics will be compared between 
groups using independent t -tests for continuous variables and Chi -square tests for categorical variables. For all 
aims, data transformations , non -parametric tests,  or generalized linear mixed models will be performed as 
appropriate .  
Aim 1:  A statistically significant decrease in dynamic hyperinflation  and/or dyspnea  during slope walking 
compared to speed walking will support our hypothesis. To dete rmine the effectiveness of speed versus slope  
on dynamic hyperinflation  and dyspnea  in patients with COPD, linear mixed -effects models will be conducted. 
The model will include dynamic hyperinflation  and dyspnea  as the outcome variable and walking conditions as 
the independent variable , as we ll as possible confounders . Missing data will be explored in terms of the 
missing data mechanism, multiple imputation s, or other missing data strategies will be considered depending 
on the extent of missing data.  
Aim 2 : A statistically significant decrease in respi[INVESTIGATOR_803399]. Similar to Aim 1, linear mixed -effects models will be used to 
identify differences between  the two walking conditions. Confounding variables and missing data will be dealt  
with in the same manner as Aim 1 . 
Aim 3:  An increase in complexity  of coupling during slope walking compared to speed walking will support our 
hypothesis. Similar to Aim 1, l inear mixed -effects models will be used to identify differences in preferred ratios  
between the two walking conditions.  Confounding variables and missing data will be dealt  with in the same 
manner.  
C.[ADDRESS_1109109] less severe disease and are healthier 
could perform better than those with greater disease severity. Therefore, only those with moderate to severe  
disease will be included  (Table 1). We have addressed  this by [CONTACT_803406]. It is possible that age may influence the results as well; however, we anticipate disease severity to be a 
larger confounding variable than age. There is no research, at this time, t o support the notion that age will 
influence one’s ability to couple walking and breathing rhythms.  
C.7 Timeline  
The study will be divided into specific goals that will be targeted and achieved  (Table 3). Every three  months, 
intermediate objectives will be assessed,  and decisions will be made regarding the course and direction of the 
continuing research effort.

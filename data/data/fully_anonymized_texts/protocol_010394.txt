Study Procedures  Screening and Enrollment/Baseline Visit (Visit 1)  
All subjects will sign an informed consent form (ICF) and inclusion/exclusion criteria will be evaluated to determine subject eligibility.  Evaluation of  subject 
eligibility will include:  demographic information; contraceptive and obstetric 
status, medical, surgical, and gynecologic history; symptom and sign severity rating; 
a physical exam with vital signs; a pelvic exam to visually inspect for genital h erpes 
and warts, assess Amsel criteria (i.e. vaginal discharge assessment, pH assessment, whiff test, and saline wet prep), and check for the presence or absence of motile trichomonads on saline wet prep and yeast on KOH wet mount; tests for  Neisseria 
gonorrhea,  Chlamydia trachomatis, Trichomonas vaginalis, and Herpes simplex (if 
suspected); culture for Candida species; a Gram stain; a pregnancy test (if indicated); a Pap smear if the subject is ≥ [ADDRESS_556351] 3 years;  and hematology and chemistry labs for subjects enrolled in the 
Mixed Infection Study.    
Since some of the required tests for eligibility will not be immediately available at 
the baseline evaluation, enrollment into an infection study will be based on cli nical 
criteria (i.e. Amsel criteria and/or signs and symptoms of VVC including KOH 
microscopy).  
 
Subjects will be randomized at Visit 1 based on infection diagnosis.  They will be 
dispensed study drug and applicators along with instructions for the administration 
of the drug; a listing of study instructions; condoms; packaging for return of unused 
drug; and a subject diary.  Subjects will record diary data between Visits 1 -2. 
 
Subjects will be asked to return their completed diaries and their unused drug, as 
directed, at their next visit (Visit 2).     
 
Test of Cure Evaluation (Visit 2) :   
Visit [ADDRESS_556352] is menstruating on the 
day of this scheduled visit, she should be rescheduled to return 24 hours after 
completion of menses.

Visit 2 procedures will include:  symptom and sign severity rating; a pelvic exam to 
assess Amsel criteria and to check for the presence or absence of motile trichomonads on saline wet prep; a culture for Candida species; a Gram st ain; 
hematology and chemistry labs for subjects enrolled in the Mixed Infection Study; and collection of unused drug.   
 
Assessment of subject compliance (i.e. with study instructions and drug administration) and information on time to resolution/reoccurrence of symptoms, 
concomitant medication use, and possible adverse events will be obtained by 
[CONTACT_232454]’s diary.  
 The investigator/clinician will be asked to document whether the subject requires any additional treatment for vaginal discomfort/symptoms.  Subjects who do require 
additional treatment should be treated per investigator/clinician judgment and be 
terminated from the study.  If a subject self- medicated for vaginal 
discomfort/symptoms, she should be terminated from the study.
b
       
Subjects who do not require additional treatment and subjects who did not self-
medicate will be asked to return for a follow -up visit (Visit 3) 21-30 days after 
randomization.     
For those subjects continuing in the study, subjec t study instructions will be 
reviewed.  If unused study drug and/or the subject diary were not returned, the subject should be reminded to return them at the next visit.   
If at any time during the study the subject or investigator has concerns about 
persi stent symptoms or adverse event(s), the subject may return to the office/clinic 
any time between visits to be evaluated (i.e. an unscheduled visit).  If the subject requires treatment for vaginal discomfort/symptoms at an unscheduled visit she 
should be te rminated  from the study.  I f treatment is not required she may return for 
her next scheduled visit.   
Some Visit [ADDRESS_556353] results used to determine whether inclusion/exclusion criteria have been met will not be available before subjects are random ized, but will 
become available during the course of the study.  Visit [ADDRESS_556354] not eligible for the study are: positive gonorrhea, chlamydia, 
trichomonas, or herpes tests; normal Nugent score < 4 (for BV and Mixed Infection 
subjects); or negative Candida culture (for VVC and Mixed Infection subjects).  
When test results that make a subject ineligible become known, subjects should be 
contact[CONTACT_232455]/clinic to be terminated from the study.  
Terminat ion procedures for these subjects are more limited and include a safety 
assessment consisting of reviewing concomitant medication use, occurrence of 
adverse events, and obtaining hematology and chemistry labs if the subject was in 
the Mixed Infection Study  and labs were not already obtained at Visit 2.  Subject 
                                                 
b Self-administration of therapy includes prescription and over the counter ( OTC ) antimicrobial, anti- fungal, analgesics, or 
steroid treatments.

 diaries should be reviewed, unused drug collected, and study drug 
administration/compliance ascertained if not already done.   
 
Follow- Up Evaluation (Visit 3):    
Visit 3 will occur 21 -30 days after randomization.  
  
Visit 3 procedures will include:  symptom and sign severity rating; a pelvic exam to 
assess Amsel criteria and to check for the presence or absence of motile trichomonads on saline wet prep; a culture for Candida  species; and a Gram stain.   
If any clinically significant hematology and/or chemistry lab changes were noted in Mixed Infection subjects at Visit 2, these labs may be repeated.   If labs for a Mixed 
Infection subject were not obtained at Visit 2, they may be obtained at Visit 3.  An assessment of subject compliance with study instructions, concomitant medication use, and possible adverse events will be obtained by [CONTACT_232456].  
Information on study drug administration/compliance and time to 
resolution/reoccurrence of sym ptoms, (if not previously ascertained or if updated 
information is available) will also be obtained by [CONTACT_232456].  
 The investigator/clinician will be asked to document whether the subject requires 
any additional treatment for vaginal infection (i.e. BV, VVC, or Mixed Infection).  
Subjects who do require additional treatment should be treated per 
investigator/clinician judgment.   
 Subjects will be asked to complete a subject satisfaction survey and will be 
terminated from the study following Visit 3.

 Secondary Endpoints and Evaluati ons 
1. BV Study:  BV clinical and Nugent score cure rates alone and combined; 
changes/improvements in Amsel criteria and Nugent scores; time to resolution of vaginal symptoms 
2. VVC Study:  VVC clinical (i.e. resolution of all signs and symptoms attributable to VVC) and mycologic cure rates (i.e. negative Candida on 
culture) alone and combined; changes/improvements in signs and symptoms scores; eradication (or persistence) of individual fungal species; time to resolution of vaginal symptoms  
3. Mixed Infection Study:  BV clinical and Nugent score cure rates alone and combined; changes/improvements in Amsel criteria and Nugent scores; VVC 
clinical and mycologic cure rates alone and combined; changes/improvements 
in signs and symptoms scores; eradication or persistence of individual fungal 
species; time to resolution of vaginal symptoms   
 Secondary endpoint evaluations will occur at Visits [ADDRESS_556356]’s entry diagnosis (i.e. study subject was enrolled in). 
 
Safety  
Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_232457], concomitant medication use, review of subject diaries, and 
obtaining blood laboratory tests for Mixed Infection subjects.  
 Safety will be assessed through summari es of adverse events (AEs) and laboratory 
evaluations. All safety analyses will be based on the safety population and will be 
summarized for each treatment group. These summaries will be presented separately 
for each infection study. Adverse events, as available, for BV Gel and VVC Gel will 
also be summarized by [CONTACT_232458]. For example, those receiving BV Gel in the BV study 
will be combined with those receiving BV Gel in the Mixed Infection study. 
Randomization 
and Treatment  An interactive voice response (IVR) system/interactive web response (IWR) system 
will randomize subjects to treatment at Visit [ADDRESS_556357] of three d oses, administered by [CONTACT_232459], at bedtime for three consecutive days.  Subjects will be randomized to treatment as follows:    
• Subjects enrolled in the BV study will receive either BV Gel (0.9% 
metronidazole gel) or Placebo Gel in a 1:1 ratio  
• Subjects enrolled in the VVC study will receive either VVC Gel (0.8% terconazole gel) or Placebo Gel in a 1:1 ratio  
• Subjects enrolled in the Mixed Infection study will receive either Combo Gel (0.9% metronidazole gel and 0.8% terconazole gel), or BV Gel (0.9% 
metronidazole gel) or VVC Gel (0.8% terconazole gel) in a 1:1:1 ratio  
Dosage of Study 
Drug/Treatment 
Regimens  • BV Gel:  0.9% metronidazole gel (45 mg of metronidazole/5 grams of gel);  
total metronidazole dose = 135 mg 
• VVC Gel:  0.8 % terconazole gel (40 mg terconazole/5 grams of gel); total 
terconazole dose = 120 mg 
• Combination BV & VVC Gel (Combo Gel):  0.9% metronidazole gel and 0.8%

 terconazole gel; total metronidazole dose = 135 mg and total terconazole dose = 
120 mg 
• Placebo Gel:  no active ingred ients  
Statistical 
Methods  Each of the three infection studies within the trial will be analyzed separately.  The 
primary assessments of efficacy will be based on the modified intent -to-treat 
(mITT) population.  This population will include all subjects randomized to 
treatment and administered at least one dose of study drug.  In addition, subjects in 
the VVC and Mixed Infection studies must have a positive baseline vaginal fungal culture for Candida species.  Subjects in the BV and Mixed Infection studies must 
have a Gram st ain Nugent score of ≥ 4 at the baseline visit.  
 In addition to the mITT analyses of the data, analyses will be conducted using the 
intent- to-treat (ITT) population (all subjects randomized to treatment) as well as the 
per protocol (PP) population (subset of mITT subjects that had no major protocol violations and who are classified as efficacy evaluable with no missing data 
required to determine primary endpoints).  
Subjects will be categorized as cure or failure for the mITT and ITT analyses and as 
cure, failure, or non- evaluable for the PP analysis.  The number and percentage of 
subjects in each treatment group in each of these categories will be reported.  
 
BV Study and VVC Study :  The primary statistical objective is to demonstrate 
superiority of active t reatment to placebo. This will be performed by [CONTACT_14664] a 
continuity corrected Chi-squared test for a difference in the proportion of cure 
between active and placebo. Also, a 95% two- sided confidence interval for the 
difference in proportion of cure betw een the two treatments will be constructed.   
 Mixed Infection Study :  The primary statistical objective of the Mixed Infection 
study is to demonstrate the superiority of the Combo Gel to both BV Gel and VVC Gel.  The assessment of superiority will be perf ormed by [CONTACT_232460] -squared tests for a difference in the proportion of Mixed Infection 
cure between the Combo Gel and each of the two single entity treatments.  If the P -
values for both of the hypothesis tests are less than or equ al to 0.05, the Combo Gel 
will be considered superior to both of the single entity gels.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_232435], no adjustment for multiplicity is 
necessary since both comparisons must be positive instead of “at least one,” in order 
to conclude superiority of the Combo Gel. Also, 95% two- sided confidence 
intervals for the difference in proportion of Mixed Infection cure between the 
Combo Gel and each of the two single entity treatments will be constructed. 
Sample Si ze Sample sizes were calculated for each infection study based on estimated cure rates 
for at least 90% power and 50 subjects per treatment group.  Superiority tests will 
be perfo rmed as two -sided, α = 0.05 level significance tests , and sample sizes were 
calculated  using Fisher’s Exact test  in case the planned Chi -squared test is not 
appropriate.

 3. Background and Rationale  
 
3.1. Bacterial Vaginosis 
Bacterial vaginos is (BV) is one of the most common vaginal disorders in women of reproductive age 
affecting almost a third of [LOCATION_002] ( US) women .1  Subjects with BV often complain of unpleasant or 
malodorous vaginal discha rge.  Some women experience discomfort or irritation.  Generally there is a 
lack of inflammation associated with BV .2  
 
The vaginal microbiome is complex and in healthy women various Lactobacillus species domina te the 
ecosystem .3 Originally referred to as “non -specific vaginitis,” the search for a causative organism in BV 
led the condition to be called, at various times, Haemophilus vaginalis  vaginitis ,[ADDRESS_556368] shown that there is a large diversity of species and that no 
individual species is universally present .9   
 The apparent lack of a single causative organism has made the diagnosis of BV somewhat more difficult 
compared to other vaginal infections.  In current medical practice,  the diagnosis is generally made based 
on the following clinical signs, which are known as the “Amsel criteria”
10: 
• Presence of a thin, homogeneous vaginal discharge 
• Vaginal pH > 4.5 
• Positive potassium hydroxide ( KOH) “whiff test” indicating presence of vola tile amines in the 
vaginal secretions  
• Presence of “clue cells” on microscopic examination of saline “wet mount” of vaginal secretions.  Clue cells are epi[INVESTIGATOR_232436].  
 Another method used to diagnose BV is interpretation of a vaginal Gram  stain according to the “Nugent 
criteria .”
11  According to this method bacteria are counted and scored based on:

1. Bacterial Vaginosis (BV) Study:  A randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled 
study to test the safety and efficacy of  BV Gel ( 0.9% metronidazole gel ) for the treatment of BV  
2. Vulvovaginal Candidiasis (V VC) Study:  A randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-
controlled study to test the safety and efficacy of VVC Gel ( 0.8% terconazole gel ) for the treatment of 
VVC  
3. Mixed Infection (Concurrent BV and VVC) Study:  A randomized, double- blind, parallel -group, 
active- controlled study to test the safety and efficacy of Combo Gel (0.9% metronidazole gel and 
0.8% terconazole gel ) for the treatment of Mixed Infection  
 
All study medication is intravaginal and will be dosed as one applicatorful for three consec utive  days.   
 
Subjects who sign an informed consent form  (ICF), are diagnosed with BV, VVC, or Mixed Infection, 
and meet eligibility requirements will be enrolled into the appropriate infection study and subsequently 
randomized to treatment based on clinical diagnosis at the screening and enrollment/baseline visit ( Visit 
1).  BV subjects will be entered into the BV Study, VVC subjects will be entered into the VVC Study, and concurrent BV and VVC (Mixed Infection) subjects will be entered into the Mixed Infection Study.  
 All subjects will be asked to return for a test of cure visit ( Visit 2) 7-[ADDRESS_556371] is menstruating on the day of the scheduled visit, she should be rescheduled to return 24 hours after completion of menses.   Subjects who in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871]/clinician require additional 
treatment for vaginal discomfort/symptoms and subjects who self- medicated for vaginal 
discomfort/symptoms, will be terminated from the study.  All other subjects will return for a follow-up 
evaluation visit ( Visit 3) 21 -30 days after randomization.  
   Study procedures will be identical  in all three infection studies with the exception of safety labs (i.e. 
Hematology:  complete blood count (CBC) with differential and Chemistry:  blood urea nitrogen ( BUN), 
Creatinine, alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ), aspartate aminotransferase ( AST), alkaline phosphatase 
(ALP ), 
and bilirubin ) which will only be o btained  at Visit 1 and V isit 2 on subjects entered into the 
Mixed Infection Study.  Ther e will be one case report form (CRF) for each subject.  The CRF will be the 
same for all three infection studies.  Analysis of safety and efficacy will be performed  separately for each 
investigational product.

5.2. Primary Efficacy Endpoints and Evaluations 
1.  BV Study:  BV cure rate, with cure defined as normal/physiologic discharge,e
2.  VVC Study:  VVC cure rate, with cure defined as resolution of all signs and symptoms attributable to 
VVC (i.e. clinical cure)   negative whiff test, and 
< 20% clue cells (i.e. clinical cure)  
3.  Mixed Infection Study:  Mixed Infection cure rate, with cure defined as BV cure (i.e. BV clinical cure) 
AND a VVC cure (i.e. VVC clinical cure)  
 
Primary efficacy endpoint evaluations will occur at the test-of-cure V isit 2.   
 
If a subject requires additional treatment for vaginal discomfort/symptoms (i.e. a BV subject requiring 
treatment for BV, a VVC subject requiring treatment for VVC or a Mixed Infection subject requi ring 
treatment for BV and/or VVC) prior to or at Visit 2, the subject will be considered a treatment failure.  
These subjects will be evaluable for the intent -to-treat (ITT), modified intent -to-treat (mITT) and the per -
protocol (PP) population analyses, providing all other evaluability criteria for these population groups have been met.    
 Additionally, if a subject self -medicates herself for vaginal discomfort/symptoms at any time prior to 
Visit [ADDRESS_556372] will remain 
evaluable for the ITT and the mITT analyses, but will be non- evaluable for the PP analysis.  
5.3. Secondary Endpoints  and Evaluations 
1. BV Study:  BV clinical and Nugent score cure rates alone and combined; changes/improv ements in 
Amsel criteria and Nugent scores; time to resolution of vaginal  symptoms  
2. VVC Study:  VVC clinical (i.e. resolution of all signs and symptoms attributable to VVC) and 
mycologic cure rates (i.e. negative Candida on culture) alone and combined ; changes/improvements 
in signs and symptoms scores ; eradication (or persistence) of individual fungal species; time to resolution of vaginal  symptoms  
3. Mixed Infection Study:  BV clinical and Nugent score cure rates alone and combined; 
changes/improvements in Am sel criteria and Nugent scores; VVC clinical and mycologic cure rates 
alone and combined; changes/improvements in signs and symptoms scores; eradication or persistence of individual fungal species; time to resolution of vaginal  symptoms   
 
Secondary endpoi nt evaluations will occur at Visits [ADDRESS_556373]’s entry diagnosis (i.e. study subject was enrolled in). 
 
6. Selection of Study Population  
 
6.1. Recruitment Procedures  
Sites will recruit participants through various mechanisms, including but not limited to recruitment from 
an investigator’s own private/clinic patients, provider referrals, Institutional Review Board ( IRB) 
                                                 
e In the event a BV subject has discharge consistent with VVC (i .e. white, creamy, and curdy [cottage cheese like] adherent to the 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130]) , the subject will be considered a BV cure providing all other criteria for BV cure (and evaluability) are met and the 
subject has a positive yeast culture .  
f Self-administration of therapy includes prescription and over -the-counter ( OTC ) antimicrobial, anti-fungal, analgesics,  or 
steroid  treatments .

v. 2.0 03/12/[ADDRESS_556374] availability may result in one site enrolling more subjects than another.  
 
Subjects will be enrolled until approximately 11 6 evaluable BV subjects, 100 evaluable VVC subjects, 
and 189 evaluable Mixed Infection subjects, per protocol population, complete the trial.  
  Once the total 
number of evaluable subjects in a study is reached, that study will be closed and the remaining studies 
will continue to enroll subjects.   
 
6.2. Registration Procedures  
All subjects who sign an informed consent and are screened for en rollment into one of the three infection 
studies will be entered into the interactive voice response (IVR)/interactive web response (IWR) system.  
 
6.2.1. Screen Failures   
If a subject d oes n ot meet eligibility  based on baseline clinical criteria or withdraws consent prior to 
study randomization, the subject will be considered a screen failure.  A case report form should not be 
filled out; however the reason the subject screen failed should be documented in the subject’s source 
notes.  Screen failures will b e tracked in the IVR/IWR system and a screening and enrollment log will 
be maintained at each site.   
 
6.2.2. Subject Identification Log 
The investigator will maintain a subject identification log throughout the trial to allow for easy identification of ea ch subject during and after the trial.  This log will be reviewed by [CONTACT_232461].  As such, no copy will be made and it will only be filed at the investigative site.  
 
6.3. Inclusion/Exclusion Crite ria 
To be enrolled into one of the three infection s tudies, subjects must meet all eligibility requirements as 
specified in the inclusion/exclusion criteria listed below.  Since some of the tests for determining 
eligibility will not be available at the baseline v isit (i.e. tests for Trichomonas vaginalis, Chlamydia 
trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, active  Herpes simplex virus; Nugent score, and yeast culture), 
enrollment will be based on clinical criteria (i.e. Amsel criteria and/or signs and symptoms of VVC 
including wet mount microscopy).  S ubject s may only be enrolled under this protocol  once.

v. 2.0 03/12/[ADDRESS_556377] s will be randomized to treatment as follows: 
• Subjects diagnosed with BV will be randomized to receive treatment with either BV Gel (0.9% 
metronidazole gel) or Placebo Gel.  Each 5-gram dose of BV Gel contains 45 mg of metronidazole 
for a total dose of 135 mg of metronidazole.                                                                                                                                                                      
• Subjects diagnosed with VVC will be randomized to receive treatment with either VVC Gel (0.8% terconazole) or Placebo Gel.  Each 5-gram dose of VVC Gel contains 40 mg of terconazole for a total 
dose of 120 mg of terconazole.   
• Subjects diagnosed with Mixed Infection will be randomized to receive treatment with BV Gel, VVC Gel, or Combo Gel (0.9% metronidazole and 0.8% terconazole).  Each 5-gram dose of the Combo 
Gel contain s [ADDRESS_556378] identical primary, secondary, and tertiary 
packaging.   Each tube of study drug will be placed in a box (secondary packaging) with three disposable 
applicators.  Each box will then be placed inside another larger box (tertiary packaging), containing study instructions ( Appendix B ), instructions for the use of study drug ( Appendix C ), condoms, a subject diary 
(Appendix D ), and return packaging to be utilized when drug is returned (i.e. the drug tube with any 
remaining unused drug inside) .  The outer box will be sealed  and labeled with a two -part label, as 
described in Section 7.5.  The entire contents of the boxes  will comprise a study Drug Kit. 
 
Each Drug Kit will be labeled (as described in Section  7.5, Labeling) with a unique Drug Kit number, 
previously determined by a computer generated randomization scheme (as described in Section 7.2, 
Randomized Tr eatment Regimens/Dosage and Administration) , that dictates the treatment assignment for 
each subject.  Both subject numbers and corresponding Drug Kit numbers will be assigned at Visit 1  via 
the IVR/IWR system at the time of randomization .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
 
Drug Kit demonstration boxes will be provided to each site for subject instructions and education.  The investigator/ clinician  will use  the demonstration kit to show each subject how to puncture the seal on the 
drug tube, fill the applicators a nd administer the gel .  Subjects will be instructed to use one applicatorful 
of study drug at bedtime for three consecutive days. All subjects should place their  drug tube in the  return 
packaging provided, seal the packaging and return it to the study sta ff at the next scheduled visit ( as 
described in S ection 7.6, Blinding). 
 Instructions for completing the diary will be reviewed with the subject.  The diary will track study drug 
dosing, study compliance, symptom resolution/reoccurrence, and adverse events.  Subjects will be 
instructed to return the completed diary  at their next scheduled visit (Visit 2).   
 
7.4. Subject Numbers  
Subject numbers will have a two -digit prefix representing the unique site number followed by [CONTACT_232463] d igit number.  Subject numbers will be assigned at the baseline visit via the interactive voice

7.6. Blinding 
The investigator/study staff will be blinded to the therapy each subject receives.  Blinding will be 
achieved by [CONTACT_232465], secondary, and tertiary  packaging of study drugs (i.e. Drug Kits ) for all 
treatment arms in all infection studies.  All infection studies will be double-blind.  
 
To maintain investigator/study staff blinding upon return of study drug, subjects will be instructed to place their unused drug inside the opaque packaging provided and return it sealed at their next scheduled 
visit.   
  Investigators w ill not receive randomization codes.  T he codes will be maintained within the IVR/IWR 
system which investigators will have the capability of breaking for an individual subject  if necessary .  
The blind should only be broken if a specific emergency treatment  would be dictated by [CONTACT_232466].  In such instances, the investigator must first notify Curatek.  If 
Cura tek is unable to be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], the investigator may telephone the IVR/IWR system to identify the 
subject’s treatm ent assig nment .  In this instance, Curatek must be notified as soon as possible.  Details 
regarding the un-blinding including the date, time, and reason for un-blinding must be documented in the 
subject’s source notes and the CRF . 
 
7.7. Drug Accountability :  Shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007], Receipt, Storage, Dispensing and Return of Study Drug  
Curatek/Curatek’s designee is responsible for shippi[INVESTIGATOR_232439] 
(i.e. Drug Kits) and study supplies.  No drug will be shipped until all required regulatory documentation 
has been obtained (i.e. IRB approval of the protocol and informed consent, Form FDA 1572, investigator 
curriculum vitae ( CV)(s) and financial disclosure(s) etc.).  All shipments of drug will contain a packing 
slip/shippi[INVESTIGATOR_232440].  Confirmation of receipt of the shipment must be made via the IVR/IWR system.    
 
The investigator /designee is responsible for en suring that the study drug is stored in a secure, limited 
access area at controlled  and monitored room temperature (20°-25 ° C [68°-77° F]; excursions permitted 
to 15°-30° C  [59°-86° F] see USP controlled room temperature ).  A temperature log must be maintained 
and will be reviewed by [CONTACT_232467].

 The investigator/designee will be responsible for accountability of study drug.  Documentation of drug 
accountability must be maintained and kept current throughout the study and includes the receipt, subject 
dispensation, subject ret urn of unused drug, and the return of unused and never dispensed drug to 
Curatek/Curatek’s designee.  During the study, drug accountability records will be reviewed by [CONTACT_232468] 
(TMF).    
  Subjects will be instructed to return their unused drug as described in Section 7.6 above to the study site 
at Visit 2.  The return of unused drug is required to complete drug accountability and for subsequent 
return, weighing, and destruction of study drug by [CONTACT_232469]/Curatek’s designee. Subjects will also be 
asked to return their completed diaries at Visit 2 so that study drug administration/ compliance can be 
confirmed.   
 
8. Prior, Concomitant, and Prohibited Medications and T reatments  
 
Subjects receiving drug therapy for conditions other than BV and/or VVC may continue those 
medications during the study, provided they are not exclusionary or prohibited  medications.  New 
medications for the treatment of conditions other than BV and/or VVC may be initiated during the study, provided they are not prohibited medications and would not interfere with the evaluation of the study 
assessments. All concomitant medication use will be documented in the subject’s source documents.   
 
Prohibited medications during the entire study include: 
• systemic, intravaginal/vulvovaginal antifungal, antimicrobial (i.e. other than study drug), and 
corticosteroid drugs  
(Note:  Inhaled, intranasal, intra -articular, and/or topi[INVESTIGATOR_8826] [provided they are not

Inclusion/exclusion criteria will be reviewed and the following procedures will be performed during the baseline visit to determine subject eligibility for infection study enrollment and to establish baseline 
parameters.   
 
9.1.1. Informed Consent 
All subjects must give written informed consent prior to performing any study- related activities.   
Assent for subjects between 12 and 18 years will be obtained per IRB requirements.  Refer to Section 
14.3. Informed Consent .  
 
9.1.2. Demographic Information, Medical & Surgical History, and Physical Exam   
Demographic information, a medical and surgical history, and  physical exa mination inclusive of vital 
signs will be performed on each subject.  The subject’s contraceptive, obstetric, and gynecological 
history will be obtained.  Concomitant medication usage (i.e. current and within 30 days of enrollment) as well as treatments fo r BV and/or VVC infections within the past year will be obtained.  
 
9.1.3. Subject  Assessment of Symptoms   
Subjects will be asked to rate their current vulvovaginal symptoms of itching, burning, and irritation 
as absent=0, mild=1, moderate=2 or severe=3.   The sum of the symptom score will be added to the 
vulvovaginal signs score obtained during the pelvic examination to determine a combined symptom and sign severity score.  This combined score must be ≥ 2 in order to meet entry criteria for 
enrollment into the VVC or Mixed Infection Study. 
 
9.1.4. Laboratory Tests and Specimen Collections  
The lab tests listed below will be obtained at the baseline visit  (Visit 1) .

• Papanicolaou smear (if subject i s ≥ [ADDRESS_556381] 3 
years)   
• Tests for Neisseria gonorrhoeae,  Chlamydia trachomatis, and Trichomonas vaginalis  
• Culture for Herpes simplex  (only if suspected) 
• Vaginal c ulture for Candida  species 
• Vaginal Gram  stain 
• CBC with differential and blood chemistries (i.e. BUN, Creatinine, ALT, AST, ALP, and 
bilirubin) for subjects enrolled in the Mixed Infection Study 
 
9.1.5. Pelvic Examination and Specimen Collections 
A non- lubricated speculum (tap water rinse acceptable)  should be used during the pelvic examination.  
Components of the pelvic examination should include the following:

VVC or Mixed Infection study. 
• Vaginal discharge characterization:  By [CONTACT_77791], characterize vaginal discharge in 
accordance with the descriptio ns below.   
o Normal/physiologic :  normal discharge may vary in appearance and consistency depending 
on the menstrual cycle;  
o Abnormal:  consistent with BV (i.e. off-white [milky or gray], thin, homogeneous discharge);   
o Abnormal:  consistent with VVC (i.e. white, creamy, and curdy [cottage cheese like] adherent to the epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130]);  
o Abnormal:  consistent with Mixed Infection (i.e. discharge of varying characteristics with relation to odor, color, and consistency)  
• pH measurement:  Obtain a vaginal pH measurem ent with the pH indicator strips provided.  Take 
care to avoid contact[CONTACT_232472].  
• Whiff test  and KOH and saline wet mounts 
o Swab lateral v aginal walls with a cotton -tipped applicator and place a liberal amount of 
discharge on each of 2 glass slides.   
o Mix 2 drops of 10% KOH with the discharge on one slide and immediately determine if a fishy, amine- like odor is present.  
o Mix 2 drops of 0.9% saline with the discharge on the other slide and place cover slips over 
both slides. 
o Examine both slides under a light microscope at both [ADDRESS_556383] organisms (hyphae, pseudohyphae, 
and/or budding yeast).  The presence of yeast is required to meet entry criteria for the VVC or Mixed Infection Study.  Several fields should be examined.  
o On the saline slide note presence or absence of clue cell and  motile trichomonads .  Multiple 
representative fields should be examined and the ratio of clue cells to epi[INVESTIGATOR_164624].  Clu e cells will be identified as epi[INVESTIGATOR_232441] a heavy coating of 
bacteria that their peripheral borders are obscured.  Clue cells must be > 
20% of vaginal 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_232442]. 
• Vagi nal Candida culture:  Obtain a Candida culture as specified in the central laboratory manual  
utilizing the collection and shipment supplies provided.  Cultures should be shipped on the day of 
collection ; unless otherwise specified for weekends and holidays. 
• Vaginal Gram  stain:  Obtain and prepare a slide for the central lab to Gram  stain as specified 
below. 
o Swab lateral vaginal walls with a cotton -tipped applicator.  Place a moderate amount of 
discharge on a glass slide and roll the applicator back and forth across the slide  as evenly as 
possible. 
o Allow the slide to air dry.  Do not fix or stain the slide.   
o Label the slide with subject ’s initials  and unique subject number, visit  number, and date.

 • Test for Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Trichomonas vaginalis as specified 
in the central laboratory manual utilizing the collection and shipmen t supplies provided. Cultures 
should be shipped on the day of collection; unless otherwise specified for weekends and holidays.   
• Culture for Herpes simplex  (only if suspected) as specified in the central laboratory manual 
utilizing the collection and ship ment supplies provided.  Cultures should be shipped on the day of 
collection ; unless otherwise specified for weekends and holidays.  
 
9.1.6. Gram  Stain Processing and Interpretation  
Gram  stains will be obtained, processed, and shipped by [CONTACT_232473] 
(Section 9.1.5.).  They  will then be stained and interpreted  by a blinded microbiologist at a central 
laboratory.  The method of interpretation is according to the Nugent scoring system .11  
 
For secondary endpoint evaluations, Gram  stain scores will be categorized as:  0 -3 = normal; 4-6 = 
intermediate, and 7-10 = BV.   
 
9.1.7. Diagnosis for Infection Study Enrollment    
Following baseline assessment, the examining clinician/investigator will determine if the subject 
meets the criteria for a diagnosis of BV, VVC, or Mixed Infection.  The clinical diagnosis (i.e. all 4 
Amsel criteria for BV diagnosis; combined symptom and sign severity score ≥ [ADDRESS_556385] on KOH 
wet mount for VVC diagnosis; and all 4 Amsel criteria, a combined symptom and sign severity score ≥ 2, and yeast on KOH microscopy for Mixed Infectio n diagnosis) will determine if a subject 
qualifies for enrollment.    
 
9.1.8. Randomization and Drug Dispensing  
After determining that a subject meets all  entry criteria, the investigator/designee will obtain a subject 
and a Drug Kit number via the IVR/IWR system .  The Drug Kit corresponding to the assigned subject 
number will be dispensed to the subject.   
 
At the time of dispensing, the subject’s initials and number will be entered on both parts of the two -
part tear-off label attached to the Drug Kit.  The tear-off portion of the label will then be affixed to the 
appropriate page of the subject’s CRF.   (The other portion will remain on the Drug Kit box being 
dispensed.)  This will allow Curatek to verify that the correct Drug Kit was dispensed to the correct 
subject by [CONTACT_232474]’s CRF to the Drug Kit number 
assigned to the subject via the IVR/IWR system.  A hard copy of the IVR/IWR system’s confirmation 
of the Drug Kit number assigned to the subject should be maintained with the subject’s source 
documents. 
 
9.1.9. Subject Instructions  
At randomization, subjects will be dispensed their assigned Drug Kit which contains study drug along with instructions for the administration/use of the drug, study instructions, and a subject diary to track 
drug dosing and study compliance, symptom resolution /reoccurrence , and adverse events, should any 
occur.  Subjects will record diary data between Visits 1 and 2 .   
 The following study instructions will  be reviewed with all subje cts at Visit 1.   
• Instruct the subject on proper dosing of study drug. 
• Demonstrate how to open the drug tube, fill the applicator, and administer the drug.  Sample tubes and applicators will be available for this purpose.

9.2.10. Assessment of Clinical Status:  Need for Additional Treatment  
Following subject evaluation, the investigator/clinician will be asked to document whether the subject requires any additional treatment for vaginal discomfort/symptoms.  Subjects who do requi re 
additional treatment should be treated per investigator/clinician judgment and terminated from the study.  These subjects should have all visit 2 procedures completed  (see Appendix A, Schedule of 
Procedures) .  Subjects who do not require treatment (and subjects who did not self- medicate) may 
remain in the study and return for their regularly scheduled follow up visit ( Visit  3). 
 
9.2.11. Determination of Cure or Failure of Subject’s Enrolled Infection  
BV subjects will be evaluated for BV cure.  All three of the clinical criteria listed below must be 
satisfied in order to be considered a BV cure (i.e. clinical cure).   
• Discharge has returned to normal/physiologic
i
• The whiff test is negative for any amine “fishy” odor.   
• The saline wet mount is < 20% clue cells.  
 
If in the investigator/clinician’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_232443] -administered drug therapy for vaginal discomfort/symptoms after completing therapy, the 
subject will be considered a BV failure.j
  
VVC su bjects will be evaluated for VVC cure.  In order to be considered a VVC cure, all signs and 
symptoms attributable to VVC must be resolved (i.e. clinical cure) .  
 
If in the investigator/clinician’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_232444] o r if the 
subject self -administered drug therapy for vaginal discomfort/symptoms after completing therapy, the

9.3.7. Assessment of Clinical Status:  Need for Additional Treatment  
Following subject evaluation, the investigator/clinician will be asked to document whether the subject 
requires any additional treatment for vaginal infection.  S ubjects who do require additional treatment 
should be treated per i nvestigator/clinician judgment.  
 
9.3.8. Distribution of Subject  Satisfaction Survey  
Subject s should be given the Subject Satisfaction Survey and asked to complete the form before 
leaving the clinic (Appendix E).  Completion of the survey is voluntary and does not affect participation in the study in any way.

additional treatment for vaginal discomfort/symptoms (either based on investigator judgment or as a 
result of the  subject self -medicating) before Visit [ADDRESS_556400] ineligible for the study (i.e. subject randomized but 
did not meet inclusion/exclusion criteria), subjects should be terminated when exclusionary lab results become known.  P rocedures for these subjects are more limited but require a safety assessment including 
collection of adverse events, concomitant medications, and safety blood labs if the subject was enrolled in 
the Mixed Infecti on Study and safety labs were not already obtained at Visit [ADDRESS_556401] diaries should be 
reviewed and unused drug tubes collected.  Drug a dministration /compliance should be ascertained if not 
already done.  Lab  results that would make a subject ineligible are:  positive gonorrhea, chlamydia, 
trichomonas, or herpes tests; normal Nugent score < 4 (for BV and Mixed Infection subjects); or negative Candida culture (for VVC and Mixed Infection subjects) .  See Appendix A, Schedule of Procedures. 
 
Other reasons f or an unscheduled visit include withdrawal by [CONTACT_232476], or 
pregnancy (see Section 10.1 ).   
 
10. Adverse Events and Safety Reporting  
 
All adverse events occurring during the course of the clinical study, regardless of relation to stu dy drug, 
will be recorded in source documentation and on the appropriate page(s) of the CRF.  The investigator 
will assess subjects for the occurrence of adverse events at both follow -up visits.  Subject diaries will also 
be reviewed for the occurrence of adverse events.  Spontaneously reported adverse events by [CONTACT_232477].   
 
10.1. Definition of Adverse Event/Adverse Reaction/Suspected Adverse Reaction  
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical  occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use 
Curatek Pharmaceuticals, LLC 
Protocol MTC-001 
 
 
Page 37 of 59 
v. 2.0 03/12/15  
 
 
 of a drug, without any judgment about causality.  An adverse reaction means any adverse event caused by 
a drug.  Adverse reactions are a subset of all suspected adverse reactions for which there is reason to 
conclude that the drug caused the event.  A susp ected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty 
about causality than an adverse reaction.   
 
Pre-existing conditions are not considered adverse events unless there is an unexpected change in the 
frequency, intensity, or nature of the condition.  Pre -planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], diagnostic or elective 
procedures/surgeries for pre-existing conditions, where there is no change in the subject’s condition, will not be considered adverse events.   
 
A newly diagnosed pregnancy during study enrollment will also not be considered an adverse event.  If a pregnancy occurs during the dosing phase of the study, the subject will be asked to discontinue study drug 
and be terminated from the study.  Curatek/Curatek’s designee should be notified via phone, fax, or e-mail/scan within [ADDRESS_556402] be 
completed and sent to Curatek/Curatek’s designee .  Subjects  should be asked to provide consent on an 
authorization for disclosure of medical information form so that follow-up information regarding the pregnancy outcome could subsequently be obtained.  If a pregnancy results in an abnormal outcome (i.e. a 
congenital anomaly/birth defect, neonatal death, stillbirth, spontaneous abortion etc.) a serious adv erse 
event must be reported.   
 
10.2. Protocol -Specific Adverse Event Considerations 
For purposes of this study, spontaneous reports of vaginal discharge and/or vulvovaginal signs and symptoms (e.g. itching, burning, irritation, erythema etc. ) associated w ith the application of study drug 
should be reported as adverse events.   However, changes in clinical criteria (i.e. Amsel criteria and/or 
vulvovaginal signs and symptoms ) from baseline that are associated with one of the vaginal infections 
under study (i.e. BV, VVC, or Mixed Infection) will be captured on the corresponding CRF page and 
should not be recorded as adverse events with the following exceptions:  
• If in the investigator/ clinician’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649] a subject treated for BV gets a secondary yeast infection,  the 
yeast infection should be captured as an adverse event.  
• If in the investigator/ clinician’ s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649] a subject treated for VVC gets BV, the BV should be 
captured as an adverse event.  
 
10.3. Definition of Serious Adverse Events  (SAE)  
Each adverse event or suspected adverse reaction must be assessed for its seriousness.  The term “serious” is not synonymous with “severe” that may be used to describe the intensity of an event or reaction.  An 
AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered serious if in the view of either the investigator or sponsor:  
• Results in death  
• Is life threatening  
The term “life threatening” refers to an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction in which either 
the investigator or the sponsor believe the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event or 
reaction ; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more 
severe.   
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_43928] 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
• Is considered medically important

v. 2.0 03/12/[ADDRESS_556403] hospi[INVESTIGATOR_232446].  
 
All adverse events or suspected adverse reactions that do not meet the criteria for serious will be regarded as non- serious.  
 
10.4. Definition of Unexpectedness  
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered unexpected if the nature/ specificity or 
severity of the event  or reaction is not consistent with applicable p roduct information (e.g. Investigator’s 
Brochure for an unapproved investigational product or a package insert/summary of an approved product).  
The current Investigator’s Brochure lists the adverse events or suspected adverse reactions known to be 
associa ted with metronidazole and terconazole.   
 
10.5. Documentation of Adverse Events  
All adverse events (i.e. serious and non -serious) that occur from the time informed consent is signed 
through Visit  [ADDRESS_556404] be reported and recorded in source documentation and on the appropriate page(s) of 
the CRF.  Information to be documented for each adverse event includes the following:  adverse event 
term, severity of the event (i.e. mild, moderate or severe), start and stop date (if applicable) of the event, 
time of even t if event occurred on the first day of study drug administration, relationship  to study drug 
(i.e. none, possible, probable, definite), action taken with the study drug (i.e. none, study drug interrupted, study drug discontinued), action taken for the adv erse event (i.e. none, new medication/treatment, 
terminated, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], or other), outcome of the event (resolved, resolved with sequelae, ongoing,  
death, or unknown) and whether or not the event meets serious criteria. 
 
If adverse event signs and symptoms are the result of a specific diagnosis, the diagnosis only (and not the 
cluster of signs and symptoms that make up the diagnosis) should be reported on the CRF. 
 
10.6. Severity Criteria  
Severity criteria for adverse events will be defined as follows:    
• Mild:  awareness of signs/ symptoms that are easily tolerated causing minimal discomfort and not 
interfering with normal daily activities  
• Moderate:  Sufficient discomfort is present and may interfere  with normal daily activities  
• Severe:  Extreme distress is present causing significant impairment of functioning or incapacitation 
preventing normal daily activities  
 
The investigator should use clinical judgment in assessing the intensity of adverse events not directly 
experienced by [CONTACT_423] (e.g. lab abn ormalities).  
 
10.7. Relatedness Criteria  
An adverse event is considered associated with the use of the drug if the attribution is possible, probable, 
or definite.  Attribution definitions for the relatedness of adverse events will be defined as follows:  
• None:  An adverse event that is not related to the use of study drug  
Curatek Pharmaceuticals, LLC 
Protocol MTC-001 
 
 
Page 39 of 59 
v. 2.0 03/12/15  
 
 
 • Possible:  An adverse event that might be due to the use of the drug; an alternative explanation (e.g. a 
concomitant drug or illness) is inconclusive.  The relationship to time is reasonabl e. 
• Probable:  An adverse event that might be due to the use of the drug; an alternate explanation (e.g. a concomitant drug or illness) is less likely.  The relationship in time is suggestive.  
• Definite:  An adverse event that cannot be reasonably explained with an alternate explanation  (e.g. a 
concomitant drug or illness).  The relationship in time is very suggestive.  A direct cause and effect 
relationship between the study drug and the adverse event exists. 
 
10.8. Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
All seriou s adverse events (SAE) that occur during the trial regardless of their relationship to study drug 
must  be reported to Curatek/Curatek’s designee as soon as possible but no later than 24 hours after 
learning of the event.  Initial notification may be made via phone, fax, or e- mail/scan.   
  
Additionally, a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Report form must be filled out and sent via fax or e-
mail/scan to Curatek /Curatek’s designee as soon as possible.  Information included with initial 
notification should include as much of the information requested on the form as possible.  The SAE 
Report form should not be held up if all the information regarding the SAE is not yet available.  The 
Concomitant Medications and the Adverse Events CRF pages should also be faxed or e- mailed/scanned 
with the SAE Report form.   
 
When additional/new information regarding the SAE becomes available, an updated SAE Report form, 
Concomitant Medications, and Adverse Events CRF pages should be promptly submitted to 
Curatek/Curatek’s designee.  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_232447] (e.g. laboratory tests, 
discharge summary, ECGs, ER records etc.) should also be submitted when they become available.   
 Specific contact [CONTACT_232478] (SAE) Report form and on the 
contact [CONTACT_232479].  
 All serious adverse events should be followed and treated appropriately until there is satisfactory 
resolution of the adverse event, the adverse event becomes stable or can be explained by [CONTACT_22714], clinical judgment indicates further evaluation is not needed, or it appears unlikely that additional 
information can be obtained given due diligence has been done. 
 
Investigators must comply with all applicable regulatory requirements related to the reporting of serious 
adverse events (i.e. regulatory authorities, IRB, institution reporting requirements etc.).   
 
10.9. Safety Reporting to Investigators, IRBs, and Regulatory Authorities by [CONTACT_232480] /Curatek designee will be responsible for reporting to the regulatory authorities (i.e. FDA) and all 
participating investigators any adverse event associated with the use of study drug (i.e. suspected adverse 
reaction) that  is both serious and unexpected; or any findings from clinical, epi[INVESTIGATOR_904], or pooled 
analysis from multiple studies or any findings from animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant 
risk in humans exposed to the drug in an IND safety report.  IND safety reports will be sent as soon as 
possible but in no event later than 15 calendar days after Curatek /Curatek ’s designee’s initial receipt of 
the information.

 Curatek/Curatek’s designee  will also notify the FDA by [CONTACT_232481] -
threatening  experience associated with the use of the study drug (i.e. suspected adverse reactions) as soon 
as possible but in no event later than 7 calendar days after Curatek /Curatek’s designee’s initial receipt of 
the information.   
 
Follow- up information to a safety report (if applicable) will be submitted as soon as relevant information 
is available.  
 Study sites utilizing a local IRB must report IND safety reports to their reviewing IRB and institution in 
accordance with IRB regulations and institutional policies.  Curatek/Curatek’s designee will report IND 
safety reports to the reviewing central IRB on behalf of those sites utilizing a central IRB.   
 
Curatek/Curatek’s designee  will be responsible for safety oversight, which include s the review of all 
adverse events.   If there are concerns on the part of any investigator or Curatek that would prevent the 
study from continuing, the study will be terminated at that time and no more subjects will be enrolled. 
 
11. Statistical Methods   
 
Summary statistics of all important demographic, study conduct, efficacy, and safety data will be provided in tables.  Case report form, clinical laboratory, and efficacy evaluation data will be provided in 
listings.  
 
11.1. General Methods  
Data from this study will be summarized with descriptive statistics.  Descriptive summaries of baseline 
and demographic data will include frequency and percent relative frequency for categorical data; frequency and median for ordinal data; and frequency, mean, standard deviation, and minimum and 
maximum for quantitative data.  In addition, 95% confidence intervals will be calculated, as appropriate.   
 
For scheduled measurements which are repeated out of schedule, such as repeat laboratory tests, the last 
measurement within a scheduled time interval will be used for data summaries.  All results, whether scheduled or repeat, will be listed.  
  Each of the three infection studies within the trial will be analyzed separately .   
 The primary statistical objective of each infect ion study is listed below: 
1. BV Study:  Demonstrate the superiority of BV Gel (0.9% metronidazole gel) to Placebo Gel i n the 
treatment of bacterial vaginosis (BV).  
2. VVC Study: Demonstrate the superiority of VVC Gel (0.8% terconazole gel) to Placebo Gel in the 
treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC).  
3. Mixed Infection Study:  Demonstrate the superiority of Combo Gel (0.9% metronidazole gel and 0.8% terconazole gel) to both single entity gels (BV Gel alone and VVC G el alone).    
 The primary and secondary endpoints are reflective of each of the infection studies within the protocol  
include:

changes/improvements in Amsel criteria and Nugent scores; VVC clinical and mycologic cure 
rates alone and combined; changes/improvements in signs and symptoms scores; eradication or persistence of individual fungal species; time to resolution of symptoms    
 A Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be prepared, with comprehensive details for all statistics to be 
presented for both primary and secondary endpoints of each study.  
 
11.2. Study Conduct Summaries  
The number of subjects who were enrolled, treated with at least one dose  of study drug, who completed 
the study, as well as the reasons for withdrawal, will be summarized with counts and percentages by [CONTACT_232482].  This table will also include number 
of screening failures and reasons for screening failures.  Protocol violations, inclusion/exclusion criteria, 
and study drug administration data will also be summarized . 
 
11.3. Analysis Populations 
The primary assessments of efficacy will be based on the modified intent- to-treat (mITT) population.  In 
addition to the mITT  analyses of the data, analyses will be conducted using the intent -to-treat (ITT) 
population as well as the per protoco l (PP) population.  The data analysis populations are defined as: 
• ITT:  The intent -to-treat analysis will include all subjects randomized to treatment.  
• mITT:  The modified intent -to-treat population will include all subjects randomized to treatment and 
administered at least one dose of study drug.  In addition, subjects in the VVC and Mixed Infection 
studies must have a positive baseline vaginal fungal culture for Candida  species.  Subjects in the BV 
and Mixed Infection studies must have a Gram  stain Nugen t score of ≥ 4 at the baseline visit.  
• PP:  The per protocol analysis will include the subset of mITT subjects that had no major protocol 
violations and who are classified as efficacy evaluable with no missing data required to determine primary endpoints.  Major protocol violations likely to bias assessment of the primary endpoint for 
the per protocol population will be determined prior to unblinding the data. 
                                                 
m In the event a BV subject has discharge consistent with VVC (i .e. white, crea my, and curdy [cottage cheese like] adherent to 
the epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130]), the subject will be considered a BV cure providing all other criteria for BV cure (and evaluability) are met and 
the subject has a positive yeast culture .

 • Safety:  The safety population will include all subjects randomized to treatment and administered at 
least one dose of study drug. 
 
11.4. Determination of Sample Size  
Approved labeling, clinical data included in New Drug Applications and approval packages, and sponsor 
experience with the compounds in this study and similar therapi[INVESTIGATOR_232448] (as proportions) for the treatments within each infection study.  
 1. BV Subjects  
a. BV Gel (0.9% metronidazole gel) : .50 (.35-.45)  
b. Placebo Gel:  .20 (.10-.20) 
2. VVC Subjects  
a. VVC Gel (0.8% terconazole gel) : .70 (. 65-.75)  
b. Placebo Gel: .20 (.15 -.25) 
3. Mixed Infection Subjects 
a. Combo Gel (0.9% metronidazole gel and 0.8% terconazole gel) : .35 (.25-.35) 
b. VVC Gel (0.8% terconazole gel) : .10 (. 05-.15)  
c. BV Gel (0.9% metronidazole gel) : .10 (.05-.15) 
 
Under the assumption that the a bove estimated cure rates will be observed in this study, sample sizes were 
calculated for each infection study based on these estimates for at least 90% power and at least 50 
subjects per treatment group.  Superiority tests will be performed as two -sided, α = 0.05 level significance 
tests, and sample sizes were calculated  using Fisher’s Exact test  in case the planned Chi -squared test is 
not appropriate.  
 
 
The following table provides the sample size required for each treatment group within each infection 
study.  The total sample size is given, and represents the number of evaluable subjects required (Per 
Protocol population).  Entry in each infection study of the trial will be stopped when this number of evaluable subjects is reached, since evaluable/not -evaluable can be determined from the completed case 
report form prior to unblinding.

 VVC Study :  The primary statistical objective of the VVC infection study is to demonstrate the 
superiority of VVC Gel to Placebo Gel.  The assessment of superiority will be performed by 
[CONTACT_14664] a continuity corrected Chi-squared test for a difference in the proportion of VVC cure 
between the two treatments.  Also, a 95% two- sided confidence interval for the difference in 
proportion of VVC cure between the two treatments will be constructed.   
 
Mixed Infection Study : The primary statistical objective of the Mixed Infection Study is to 
demonstrate the superiority of the Combo Gel to both BV Gel and VVC Gel.  The assessment of superiority will be performed by [CONTACT_14664] a continuity corrected Chi- squared tests for a difference 
in the proportion of Mixed Infection cure between the Combo Gel and each of the two single entity 
treatments.  If the P -values for both of the hypothesis tests are less than or equal to 0.05, the Combo 
Gel will be considered superior to both of the single entity gels.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_232449], no adjustment for multiplicity is necessary since both comparisons must 
be positive instead of “at least one,” in order to conclude superiority of the Combo Gel.  Also, 95% 
two-sided confidence intervals for the difference in proportion of Mixed Infection cure between the 
Combo Gel and each of the two single entity treatments will be constructed. 
 
11.6.2. Secondary Efficacy Analyses  
Secondary efficacy endpoints are listed in Section 5.3.  These endpoints include variables that are 
categorical (including binary variables), ordinal (such as rating scores), or time to event variables 
(such as time to resolution of symptoms). The analysis of the secondary endpoints will be performed 
using the mITT population with worst case scenario imputation for missing data, with supportive 
analyses conducted using the PP population. 
 
For the secondary endpoints which are categorical or ordinal with four or fewer levels (including 
binary outcome variables), the analysis will include the proportion of subjects with each criteria or 
each score, at baseline and endstudy.  The comparison of treatment groups will be performed using 
Chi-squared tests if all expected cell counts are at least 5, and Fisher’s Exact test otherwise.   For 
binary outcomes, (clinical outcome, mycological outcome, and eradication [ or persistence ] of 
individual fungal species) 95% two-sided confidence intervals for the difference in proportions will also be constructed.  
 Secondary endpoi nts which are ordinal data with more than four levels, such as Nugent score, the 
median score at baseline, endstudy, and the change from baseline will be computed, in addition to the 
proportion of subjects at each level.  Treatment comparisons will be perf ormed using the Wilcoxon 
Rank Sum test.  
 
The secondary endpoint of time to resolution of symptoms will be analyzed in each infection study using log- rank tests and Kaplan -Meier plots.  Kaplan -Meier estimates of the quartiles for time to 
resolution will be computed, along with 95% confidence intervals. 
 
The analysis of eradication (persistence) of individual fungal species will be conducted in subgroups of subjects defined by [CONTACT_232484] (for the VVC and Mixed Infection studies).   
 
11.7. Safety Analysis 
Safety will be assessed through summaries of adverse events ( AEs) and laboratory evaluations.  All safety 
analyses will be based on the safety population, as defined in Section  10.3 and will be summarized for 
Curatek Pharmaceuticals, LLC 
Protocol MTC-001

 each treatment group.  Thes e summaries will be presented separately for each infection study.  In 
addition, adverse events, as available, for BV Gel and VVC Gel will also be summarized by [CONTACT_232485].  For example, th ose receiving BV 
Gel in the BV study will be combined with those receiving BV Gel in the Mixed Infection Study.  
11.7.1. Adverse Events 
Adverse events will be coded by [CONTACT_232486] a current version of Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Each verbatim adverse event will be 
translated to a preferred term, a higher -level included term, and finally a system  organ class.  Adverse 
events will be summarized at each level of the hierarchy, counting proportions of t he subjects who 
experienced at least one such adverse event.   Frequencies of subjects with treatment- emergent 
adverse events (TEAEs) , sorted by [CONTACT_9313], will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570]. 
TEAEs are defined as those AEs that develop or worsen after the first dose of study drug and up to 
the date of the final visit.   Any adverse events that are not considered treatment emergent will be 
provided in listings.   
 A secondary analysis of TEAEs judged by [CONTACT_232487]. This analysis will be summarized identically to the above analysis. Additional breakdowns of serious adverse events (SAEs) and treatment -related SAEs will be summarized and 
described in a similar fashion.   
Summaries of AE durations, sev erity, relatedness to study drug, countermeasures taken, outcome, and 
seriousness will also be produced as warranted.  At the least, incidence of study drug discontinuation 
and death will be summarized. 
 
11.7.2. Laboratory Assessments 
CBC with differential  and blood chemistry data will be tabulated and compared to baseline for the 
Mixed Infection study population.  Laboratory endpoints will be summarized for baseline, endstudy, 
and for change from baseline to end study using descriptive statistics (mean, med ian, standard error, 
minimum, and maximum).  In addition, summarization of laboratory values that deviate substantially 
from the normal reference range will be provided.  The reference ranges for normal laboratory values 
will be provided by [CONTACT_171131].   
 Shift tables will be provided, which tabulate the proportion of subjects in each treatment group who 
change from low abnormal (< LLN), normal, or high abnormal (> ULN) at baseline to low abnormal, 
normal, or high abnormal at Visit 2, as shown in the following table.

12.1. Source Documents   
Source data is all information in a clinical trial that would allow for the reconstruction and evaluation of 
the trial.  Source data are contained in source documents.  S ource documents are original documents and 
include :  clinic, office , and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097] (i.e. paper or electronic); source document worksheets that 
will be provided by [CONTACT_232488]; laboratory results ;  subj ect 
diaries ; drug accountability records, etc.   The nature and location of all source documents should be 
known to Curatek/Curatek’s designee (and the study staff) so that original subject data recorded can be verified against data entered on the CRF.  All  source notes should be signed and dated by [CONTACT_1275]/study staff so that the author of the note/entry (and the date) can be identified.   
  
12.2. Case Report Forms  
Paper case reports forms (CRF) will be provided by [CONTACT_232489], L LC.  Cu ratek/Curatek’s 
designee will train appropriate study staff on the use of the CRFs.  CRFs will be printed in triplicate on 
non-carbon required (NCR) paper.  The original and one copy of each page of the CRF will be collected 
by [CONTACT_232469]/Curatek’s designee d uring routine monitoring visits.    
 Case report forms should be completed in accordance with CRF completion guidelines provided by 
[CONTACT_232469].  All CRF entries and corrections must be made by [CONTACT_232490] a delegation of responsibili ty log. Corrections of data entered on the CRF must be made in the following 
manner: 
• If the original CRF page is still at the study site, the incorrect entry will be crossed out (on the 
original page) with a single line so as to remain legible.  No correction fluid or erasers are permitted.  The correct data will then be entered in ink next to the crossed -out entry.  Each correction, change, or 
addition of new data must be initialed and dated by [CONTACT_114654], change, or 
addition. 
• If the original page has already been sent to Curatek/data management and a data error is noted by [CONTACT_232491], a site initiated data clarification form (SIDCF) should be generated by [CONTACT_232492] a data change.  If data management 
believes a data point needs to be corrected/clarified, a data clarification form (DCF) will be generated by [CONTACT_165573] (either manually or automated) and sent to the site.  In either instance, the original SIDCF or DCF will be retained by [CONTACT_5753] a copy scanned to data management.    
 The investigator must initial or sign and date where indicated on the CRF page(s), indicating that all data 
entries are accurate and complete. The investi gator must retain full responsibility for the accuracy and 
authenticity of all data entered on the CRFs from his/her site.

result or adverse event follow -up information.  Data reported in the CRFs should be recorded/transcribed 
from source documents.  Diaries filled out by [CONTACT_232493].  
The clinical monitor will review the CRF  against appropriate source documents an d evaluate all data 
entries for accuracy and completeness.  If data is missing or errors are noted , the investigator/designee  
should correct the CRF as above.  
12.3. Record Retention  
U.S. FDA regulations (21 CFR §312.62[c]) and the ICH Guideline for GCP require that records and 
documents pertaining to the conduct of this study and the distribution of investigational drug, including 
CRFs,  consent forms, laboratory test results, and medication inventory records, must be retained by [CONTACT_1268] [INVESTIGATOR_8178] [ADDRESS_556407]. All state 
and local laws for retention of records also apply.   
 These documents should be retained for a longer period of time if required by [CONTACT_232494].  No documents should be destroyed unless written 
approval to do so has been received by [CONTACT_232469].  Written notification should be provided to Curatek for 
transfer of any records to another party or moving them to another location. 
 
12.4. Data Management  
The data  management center will be determined by [CONTACT_232495].  Data will 
arrive by [CONTACT_232496], except laboratory data which will arrive electronically from the central lab.  
 
The data management center will use validated software to process both the paper case report forms and electronic laboratory data.  An electronic audit trail will be maintained to document all changes to the database after double data entry or receipt of electronic  data.  Prior to processing data, a data management 
plan will be written by [CONTACT_232497].  This document will be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_456], and 
updated during the study as needed. 
 
13. Study Management 
 
13.1. Monitoring and Source Data 
Clinical monitor s/representatives of Curatek Pharmaceuticals, LLC will perform on- site monitoring visits 
as often as necessary  to ensure that all aspects of the protocol are followed.  Monitors will record their 
visits o n a site visit log that will be kept at the site.  A site initiation visit (SIV) for the purpose of training 
the investigator(s) and study staff on the protocol, CRFs, and all related study activities will be conducted 
at each site prior to subject screeni ng.  The first post -initiation visit  will take place shortly after subject  
enrollment b egins at each site and a close out visit will occur after the last subject completes the study.  
 
During monitoring visits, source documentation will be reviewed for verification of data entered on the 
CRF.  Source documents include but are not limited to c linic and office charts (i.e. paper and/ or 
Curatek Pharmaceuticals, LLC 
Protocol MTC-001 
 
 
Page 48 of 59 
v. 2.0 03/12/15  
 
 
 electronic), laboratory and vaginal culture results, Gram stain results, and subject  diaries .  In collaboration 
with Curatek,  the study monitor will assist in assessing whether electronic records generated from 
computerized medical record systems used at investigational sites can serve as source documents for the 
purposes of this protocol. If a site’s computerized medical record  system is not adequately validated for 
the purposes of clinical research (as opposed to general clinical practice),  applicable hardcopy source 
documents must be maintained to ensure that critical  protocol data entered into the CRFs can be verified .   
 
The review of regulatory documents, informed consents, and drug storage and accountability records will 
also be done during monitoring visits.  Monitors will meet with the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_232450]’s performance.  Monitors will also 
provide feedback to Curatek regarding site visits on a regular basis.    
 
Direct access to source documentation (i.e. paper and/or electronic), and to the drug storage and 
dispensing area must be allowed during monitoring visits.  It is also expected that investigator/study staff will be available to assist the monitor in his/her activities, CRFs will be completed, and ICFs, drug 
accountability and regulatory records will be available for review.  A suitable area should be provided for 
the monitor to work during monitoring visits.  
13.2. Protocol Adherence  
The investigator must read this protocol thoroughly and not deviate from it, unless a protocol waiver is 
received or it is n ecessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to study subjects.  Should this occur the 
investigator should notify Curatek/Curatek’s designee immediately and the reviewing IRB.   
 
13.3. Protocol Amendments  
Changes in any portion of this protocol after signatures of agreement are obtained must be presented in the form of an amendment, signed by [CONTACT_232498], and approved by [CONTACT_232499].  The only time a protocol amendment may be 
initiated without IRB approval is when the change is necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazard(s) 
to the subject(s).  In such an event Curatek will forward the protocol amendment to the FDA and the investigator will forward it to the reviewing IRB.  Minor study management issues, administra tive 
changes, and typographical errors do not require protocol amendments.  
 
13.4. Protocol Violations    
All protocol violations should be documented in subject’s source notes and on the appropriate CRF page.  
Protocol violations should be reported to Cura tek and the reviewing IRB , as per their requirements.   
  
13.5. Quality Assurance and Regulatory Agency Audits   
The study site may be audited by [CONTACT_1201], Curatek/Curatek designees, independent auditors, or regulatory agencies (i.e. FDA).  If the site is co ntacted by a regulatory agency for an inspection, Curatek should be 
notified immediately.   
 
In accordance with ICH guidelines, the investigator/institution must allow direct access to all trial related 
records for the reviewing IRB, Curatek/Curatek designees, auditors, and regulatory agencies (i.e. FDA).

Page 49 of 59 
v. 2.0 03/12/15  
 
 
 14.1. Ethical Considerations  
All aspects of this study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol and in accordance with all 
applicable regulatory requi rements, and in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) . Investigators 
must also conduct the study in accordance with all of the above and any local/regional regulatory requirements.  Many of the investigator responsibilities for this study are contai ned within the Form FDA 
1572- Statement of Investigator which must be completed and signed before the investigator may 
participate in the study.  
 
14.2. Institutional Review Board  
This protocol (and any subsequent amendments) must be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_232500] (IRB) that complies with federal regulations 21CFR, Part 56 prior to initiation 
of the study.  Curatek will supply all documents required for submission to the IRB for review and approval.  These documents include the protocol, investigator’s brochure, informed consent template, 
subject recruitment/advertising materials, written information that will be provided to subjects (i.e. 
instructions for subjects, instructions for using study drug, subject diary, and subje ct satisfaction survey) 
and any other documents that the IRB needs to fulfill its responsibilities.  Formal written notification of 
the protocol and informed consent approval is required by [CONTACT_232501].  Approval letters must be dated and clearly identify the documents 
approved.   
 
Investigative sites must adhere to all requirements stipulated by [CONTACT_232502].  These include notification to the IRB regarding protocol amendments, updates/changes to informed consents, protocol 
violations, recruitment/advertising materials, safety reporting requirements, ongoing review of the study 
at specified intervals, and submission of a final report.  A copy of IRB approvals and relevant 
correspondence/documentation between the investigative site and the IRB must be maintained and provided to Curatek/Curatek’s designee as requested.  
 
Payment to subjects must be approved by [CONTACT_232503].  
 
14.3. Informed Consent  
The investigator /designee  will be responsible for obtaining written informed consent from each subject  
prior to performing any study- related procedures.  (Assent for children between 12 and 18 years will be 
obtained per IRB requirements.)  The consent form should be reviewed by [CONTACT_232469]/Curatek’s designee (i.e. if changes were made from the informed consent template provided by [CONTACT_232469]) and must be 
approved by [CONTACT_3488].  The consen t form should be in accordance with all applicable regulatory 
requirements, and in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP).  
 Subjects should be given ample time to review the consent and ask any questions they may have.  Once 
they decide to participate in the study, the informed consent must be signed and dated by [CONTACT_232504].  The investigator/designee must document 
the informed consent process in the subject’s source document.  A copy of the signed informed consent should be given to the subject. 
 
A written subject authorization (i.e. HIPAA authorization) either provided as a separate document or 
contained within the informed consent that explains to the subject the permissible uses and disclosures of 
Curatek Pharmaceuticals, LLC 
Protocol MTC-001 
 
 
Page 50 of 59 
v. 2.0 03/12/[ADDRESS_556408]’s personal health information (PHI) must also be obtained.  Stand-alone authorizations do not 
require review or approval from an IRB; however core elements and statements must be included in them.  
 If there are any revisions to t he informed consent or to written materials given to the subjects, they should 
be IRB approved prior to their use.  Subjects should be informed in a timely manner of any new information that becomes available during the course of the study that may be relevant to the subject’s participation in the study.  All revised informed consent forms must be reviewed and signed by [CONTACT_232505].  The subject should receive a copy of the 
signed, revised consent and the date of re -consenting should be documented in the subject’s source 
document.   All original signed and dated consent forms will be kept by [CONTACT_093]. 
 
14.4. Delegation Log 
The investigator will maintain a delegation log  throughout the study.  The delegation log will comprise a  
listing of appropriately qualified persons to whom the investigator has delegated significant trial- related 
activit ies/tasks.  The investigator should initial and date the delegation log at the beginning of the trial 
when activ ities/tasks are delegated and when changes occur.  The investigator should also sign the 
delegation log at the end of the study; the completed log will be maintained in the trial master file (TMF) .   
 
14.5. Reports and Publications 
Publication of study res ults should be followed as presented in the Clinical Trial Agreement (CTA).  
 
14.6. Public Posting of Trial Information

(FDAMA) Section [ADDRESS_556409] (FDAAA) Section 801. Information posted may include participating investigators’ names and contact [CONTACT_3031].   
 
14.7. Subject Release from the Study  
All subject s are free to withdraw from participation in the study at any time, and for whatever reason, 
specified or unspecified, and without prejudice.  The r eason for the discontinuation will be entered onto 
the study termination page of the CRF.  No constraints will be placed on ordinary subject  management, and subjects may be placed on other 
conventional therapy upon request or whenever clinically necessary.  
14.8. Sponsor Discontinuation of Study  
Premature termination of this study may occur as a result of a regulatory (i.e. FDA) or IRB decision, a drug safety issue, or at the discretion of Curatek.  Curatek retains the right to discontinue development of 
BV, VVC, Combo, and Placebo Gels at any time.   
 
If the study is prematurely terminated, Curatek will promptly notify all investigators.  Investigators must

1.0     Objectives  
1.1 Primary  Objectives:  
 
A. To determine the optimal dose and schedule of melphalan for injection (Evomela) prior to 
autologous  hematopoietic  stem  cell transplantation (auto- HCT)  for multiple  myeloma  (MM).

in newly diagnosed myeloma patients treated on different schedules and doses of 
Evomela.  
B. To determine the rate of minimal residual disease (MRD) negative complete response (CR) rate at day [ADDRESS_886234] negative is defined as absence of 
phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_657336]  (NGF)  on bone marrow  
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_657337]  (or validated equivalent method) with a minimum sensitivity of 1 in 10

cells or higher.  
C.To determine the progression- free survival (PFS)  after auto-HCT in newly  diagnosed 
myeloma patients treated on different schedules and doses of  Evomela.  
2.0 Background and Rationale  
2.1 Rationale and  Hypothesis  
 
The solubilizer used in alkeran (brand name [CONTACT_58114]) for injection is propylene glycol (PG), 
which is potentially associated with an array of side effects, such as renal failure, cardiac 
arrhythmias, hyperosmolality, increased anion gap metabolic acidosis, and sepsis like 
syndrome. In addition, melphalan has marginal solubility and limited chemical stability upon 
reconstitution and dilution that prevents the solution from being administered as a longer 
infusion. The commercial product; after reconstitution with sterile solution that contains PG; can develop an impurity (citrate derivative of melphalan) in <30 minutes and, when further diluted, 
melphalan loses its potency over time.  
 
Melphalan for injection (Evomela)  is a PG free reformulation of alkeran.  Evomela incorporates 
Captisol  brand of beta-cyclodextrin sulfobutyl  ethers  sodium  salts.  The substitution of Captisol 
for the excipi[INVESTIGATOR_657338].  
Evomela can be dissolved directly using saline. Results show that based on the increase in total impurities in Evomela at 0.45 mg/mL, admixture solutions are about 5, 9, 15 and 29 times 
more stable at concentrations of 0.45, 1.0, 2.0 and 5.0 mg/mL, respectively. Results confirmed 
that reconstituted Evomela solution can be stored in the vial for up to 1 hour at room 
temperature or for up to 24 hours at refrigerated temperature (2 – 8 °C) with no significant 
degradation. After storage in the vial, it remains stable for an additional 3 to 29 hours after 
preparation of admixture solution in infusion bags at concentrations of 0.25 to 5.0 mg/mL, 
 
2017-0399 Version 11.0  11 February 2022  Page 4 of 27 
 
 respectively. In addition, Evomela solution in saline, at concentration of 5.0 mg/mL melphalan 
was bacteriostatic through 72 hours storage at 2 – 8 °C (Evomela Investigators Brochure, 
Appendix A).  
 
Depending on the final concentration, it is stable at room temperature for up to 24- hours upon  
reconstitution followed  by [CONTACT_657353]  (Evomela  Investigator  Brochure,  Appendix  A). This 
results  in less handling of this cytotoxic agent  by [CONTACT_657354] a concomitant 
decrease in exposure risks and increase in convenience and administration flexibility.  
 
Based on the above observations, we hypothesize that Evomela will be easier to handle and 
administer to the patients compared to alkeran. Furthermore, Evomela may actually be less 
toxic due to the absence of PG and this will allow for the escalation of dose and prolongation of 
infusion time, in order to increase the efficacy of melphalan in patients undergoing auto -HCT.  
 
2.2 Introduction and Background 
 
2.2.1 Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation In Multiple  Myeloma  
 
A pi[INVESTIGATOR_657339] (IFM) trial in [ADDRESS_886235] 
prolonged survival compared to the conventional chemotherapy[1]. Thereafter, several trials have shown that auto -HCT can prolong PFS[2, 3] or both PFS and OS[4, 5] compar ed to 
non-transplant based regimens (Table 1). Based on available data auto- HCT is recommended 
as consolidative therapy for patients with MM (grade A recommendation from American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation)[6].

Melphalan Dose Escalation Studies  
 
Melphalan remains the mainstay of pre -transplant conditioning therapy for myeloma and no 
other drug combination has convincingly shown superiority over melphalan alone. The data suggests that more intense chemotherapy may be useful in prolonging survival. For instance, 
the IFM 9502 randomized study comparing total body irradiation (TBI) + melphalan 140 mg/m2 
(MEL 140) to melphalan 200 mg/m2 (MEL 200) in newly diagnosed symptomatic myeloma patients younger then 65 -year old showed that higher dose melphalan lead to superior overall 
survival (OS), 45.6% vs. 65% at 45 months, despi[INVESTIGATOR_657340] (TRM)[7]. The incidence of grade 3 -4 mucositis was 30%  
 
In another study by [CONTACT_239914].[8], MEL 200 and MEL 100 were compared in a randomized manner in newly diagnosed myeloma patients assigned to receive 2 auto -HCTs. OS did not 
differ ( P = .13); median PFS (31.4 vs 26.2 months, P = .01), median time to progression (34.4 
vs 27.0 months, P = .014) were longer in the MEL200. Treatment -related mortality was 3.1% in 
the MEL 200 and 2.9% in the MEL [ADDRESS_886237] 1 non- hematologic grade 3 or 4 adverse event 
were significantly higher in the MEL200 cohort.

 Moreau et al.[9] treated [ADDRESS_886238] was 
grade 4 mucositis (WHO scale) in 63% of patients. Two patients experienced reversible 
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation after MEL 220. No liver, renal, or pulmonary toxicity was observed.  
 
Phillips et al.[10] conducted a study to define a new maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the dose- limiting toxicity (DLT) of melphalan and auto -HCT when used with the cytoprotective agent 
amifostine. Escalating doses of melphalan beginning at 220 mg/m2 and advancing by 20 mg/m2 increments were used until severe regimen- related toxicity (RRT) was encountered. Melphalan 
was given in doses up to and including 300 mg/m2. Although mucosal RRT was substantial, it was not the DLT, and some patients given the highest  melphalan doses (ie, 300 mg/m2) did not 
develop mucosal RRT. There was no obvious increased incidence of grade I versus grade II mucosal toxicity at any dose level beyond melphalan 220 mg/m2. No patient developed grade  
ꞏIII mucosal or gastrointestinal RRT. The DLT was not clearly defined. Cardiac toxicity in the 
form of atrial fibrillation occurred in 3 of 36 patients treated with melphalan doses ꞏ280 mg/m2 and was deemed fatal in 1 patient given melphalan 300 mg/m2 (Table 2). Another patient given 
melphalan 300 mg/m2 died of hepatic necrosis. The MTD of melphalan in this setting was thus 
considered to be 280 mg/m2, and 27 patients were given this dose without severe RRT. There was no delayed toxicity.

In a more recent trial of 19 patients, dose- escalation of melphalan administered on day -2 
began at 200 mg/m2  with palifermin  administered at a fixed  dose of 60 mcg/kg/day.  Subsequent 
dose escalations of melphalan were done at 20 mg/m2 increments up to a maximum dose of 
280 mg/m2. There were no treatment -related deaths by [CONTACT_4475] 100. The overall incidence of oral 
mucositis grade 3 was 44% (8/18) with a median duration of severe mucositis of 5 days. Grade 
4 mucositis  was seen  in only 1 patient  who was given MEL 200 (Table 3). Two of 6 patients  who 
were given MEL 280 did not develop oral mucositis. Cardiac DLT in the form of atrial fibrillation did occur in 1 of 6 patients treated with MEL 280. Further dose escalation was not allowed due 
previous report of cardiac toxicity with MEL  300[11].

Only 1 patient in the whole group receiving melphalan 200 mg/m2 developed grade [ADDRESS_886239][12]. Two doses of amifostine 740 mg/m2 IV over 5 -15 minutes were 
administered 24 hour and 15 min before MEL 280 to ameliorate mucosal toxicity. Between 
5/1999 and 10/2003, 58 MM patients received this high dose regimen after  
dexamethasone- based induction regimens. Bearman critieria were utilized for grading RRT: 
grade 1 mucositis was seen in 41%, grade 2 in 14% and grade 3 in 1.7%. Other grade 3 
toxicities included: lung (1.7%) and renal (1.7%); 1 patient died from melphalan-i nduced 
interstitial pneumonitis; 7% experienced atrial fibrillation or flutter. Of the 57 evaluable patients, 
CR was achieved in 28 (49%), VGPR in 6 (11%), PR in 17 (30%), SD in 4 (7%) unknown in 1  
(1.5%) and progression in 1 (1.5%). PFS and OS at 7 years was 10% and 39% respectively. The authors concluded that MEL 280 dose escalation increased response depth, however, 
sustainability of response was not impacted.

2.3 Rationale For Melphalan Dose Escalation  
 
Increasing the dose of melphalan can result in improvement in response rates[12]. In order to 
investigate the pharmacokinetics of total and unbound plasma melphalan using a population 
approach, population pharmacokinetic modelling was performed with total and unbound 
concentration–time data from 100 myeloma patients (36–73 years) who had received a median 
192 mg m2 melphalan dose[13]. Total area under the curve (AUC; range 4.9– 24.4 mg l -1 h) and 
unbound AUC (range 1.0 –6.5 mg l -1 h) were significantly higher  in patients who had oral 
mucositis (ꞏgrade 3) and long hospi[INVESTIGATOR_614] ( P < 0.01). Patients who responded well had 
significantly higher unbound AUC (median 3.2 vs. 2.8 mg l -1 h, P < 0.05) when assessed from 
diagnosis to post -melphalan and higher total AUC (median 21.3 vs. 13.4 mg l -1 h, P = 0.06), 
when assessed from pre - to post -melphalan.  
 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_657341], the most widely used dose is 200 mg/m2, primarily due to concerns of toxicity and lack of prospective data. With the 
availability of a more stable and potentially less toxic Evomela, it seems reasonable to study the 
dose escalation in order to improve the outcomes.  
 
2.[ADDRESS_886240] been 
demonstrated to increase the antitumour activity of several drugs (for example, cytarabine in the 
treatment of acute leukemia, bleomycin in cervical carcinom a, 5-fluorouracil in colon carcinoma, 
methotrexate in acute lymphocytic leukemia)[14]. 
 
For several reasons melphalan maybe a good candidate for continuous infusion: 1) a short  
half-life, 2) a small volume of distribution, 3) a mechanism of action that is not cycle specific and 
is time -dependent, and 4) its uptake is a saturable process[14]. Indeed, pre -clinical data 
suggests that sequential exposure of melphalan was more effective than solid exposure at the same dose in myeloma cell lines[14]. However, due to the instability of the currently available 
alkeran at the room temperature, the infusional studies have not been possible. This limitation 
will be overcome by [CONTACT_657355]  
30-60 minute bolus doses.  
 
2.5 Clinical Experience and Potential Benefits of Using Evomela  
 
In a phase IIa, open- label, randomized, cross -over design bioequivalence study, the 
pharmacokinetics of Evomela were compared with the marketed formulation of melphalan 
(Alkeran)[15]. Patients received half of the total dose of melphalan in the form of Alkeran and the 
other half in the form of Evomela in an alternating manner. Twenty -four patients were enrolled 
between 4 February 2010 and 16 May 2011. The median age of enrolled subjects was 58 years 
(range: 48–65). All patients achieved myeloablation [ADDRESS_886241] followed by [CONTACT_657356] a median of 11 days after transplant. Pharmacokinetic analysis showed that Evomela was bioequivalent with Alkeran and also revealed that maximum plasma 
concentration (Cmax) and area under the plasma concentration- time curve were higher (~10%) 
after Evomela administration. The authors concluded that Evomela is bioequivalent to Alkeran 
while also demonstrating a marginally higher systemic drug exposure.  
 
In another clinical trial Evomela (200 mg/m2) was administered as 2 doses of 100 mg/m2 each 
 
2017-[ADDRESS_886242]. Sixty -one patients were 
enrolled[16]. All achieved myeloablation. Median time to neutrophil and platelet engraftment was 
12 days and 13 days, respectively. Day -100 TRM was 0%. Overall response rate (ORR) was 
100% with a CR rate of 21%. The incidence of grade 3 mucositis and stomatitis was low (10% and 5%, respectively) with no grade 4 mucositis or stomatitis reported (graded according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events).  
 
Evomela appears to be a safe alternative to Alkeran and has demonstrated that when used as 
conditioning regimen, it is able to meet the pertinent transplant related outcomes such as myeloablation and engraftment. 
 
In summary Evomela can potentially be associated with the following benefits:  
 
· Evomela results  in marginally,  but statistically  significant, higher  systemic drug levels  than 
Alkeran (~110%)  (P<0.05).  
· Evomela is more  stable following  reconstitution,  which  eliminates  the time constraints  that 
are imposed on pharmacists and nursing staff when preparing high- dose Alkeran for 
infusion.  These  timing  issues  might  result  in delivery  of a less than intended dose of 
high- dose melphalan at time of transplant, which results in effective- dose variability between 
patients.  
· Evomela can potentially enable safe administration of higher doses of melphalan, which 
may lead to better  myeloma responses.  This is expected because response to high- dose 
therapy is dose dependent and has a linear, steep dose- response curve[17].  
· Evomela might  also be considered in situations  where Alkeran  is associated with suspected 
infusion reactions[18].

3.0 Background Drug Information  
3.1 Melphalan HCL for Injection (Evomela) 
Pharmacologic Category: Alkylating  Agent  
Mechanism of Action: Alkylating agent which is a derivative of mechlorethamine that inhibits  
DNA and RNA synthesis via formation of carbonium ions; cross -links strands of DNA; acts on 
both resting and rapi[INVESTIGATOR_46548].  
Major Excipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]:  
Captisol is a substituted ß- cyclodextrin that serves as the major functional excipi[INVESTIGATOR_657342]. 
Captisol performs as a solubilizing and stabilizing agent by [CONTACT_657357]. When the formulation is administ ered intravenously, the 
equilibrium between melphalan and melphalan- Captisol complex rapi[INVESTIGATOR_657343]: IV 
Compatibility:  
The presence of Captisol facilitates the use of an aqueous initial diluent (Sodium Chloride for 
Injection) for the resultant freeze -dried product instead of the co -solvent diluent necessary for 
the reconstitution of Alkeran. The Ligand formulation does not  need a second vial of solvent for 
reconstitution and can be dissolved directly using saline.

For the purpose of this study, Evomela (2 mg/ml) will be infused using two different infusion 
schedules. Patients will be randomized to different schedule  cohorts as explained in section 
11.2.1 and given either a 30- 60 minute infusion or 8- 9 hour infusion. Because 2 mg/ml Evomela 
is stable for 10 hours, patients receiving the 8 -9 hour infusion will receive the total dose in one 
single bag to complete the infusions.  
 
Note: Melphalan is a vascular irritant; local reactions may occur. Extravasation may cause local tissue damage; administration via a central line is recommended; do not administer by [CONTACT_657358] a peripheral vein.  
 
Pregnancy Risk: May cause fetal harm if administered during pregnancy. Women of 
childbearing potential should be advised to avoid pregnancy while on melphalan therapy.  
 
Lactation: Use not recommended.  
Storage and Handling: Melphalan for injection (Evomela) is a PG free reformulation of 
alkeran. Evomela incorporates Captisol brand of beta- cyclodextrin sulfobutyl ethers sodium 
salts. The substitution of Captisol for the excipi[INVESTIGATOR_657344]. Evomela can be dissolved directly using saline. Results show 
that based on the increase in total impurities in Evomela injection at 0.45 mg/mL, admixture solutions  are about  5, 9, 15 and 29 times  more  stable at concentrations  of 0.45,  1.0, 2.0 and 5.0 
mg/mL,  respectively.  Results  confirmed that reconstituted Evomela solution  can be stored  in the 
vial for up to 1 hour at room  temperature  or for up to 24 hours  at refrigerated  temperature  (2 – 8 
°C) with no significant degradation. After storage in the vial, it remains stable for an additional 3 
to 29 hours after preparation of admixture solution in infusion bags at concentrations of 0.25 to  
5.0 mg/mL, respectively. In addition, Evomela solution in saline, at concentration of 5.0 mg/mL melphalan was bacteriostatic through 72 hours storage at 2 – 8 °C Evomela Investigators

transplant evaluations are completed.   
8.0 Adverse Events and Reporting  Requirements 
An adverse event is the appearance or worsening of any undesirable sign, symptom, or medical 
condition occurring after starting the study drug even if the event is not considered to be related 
to study drug. The investigator (or physician designee) is responsible for verifying and providing 
source documentation for all adverse events and assigning the attribution for all adverse events 
for subjects enrolled.  
8.[ADDRESS_886255] consequences will be scored as definitive  
related. 
 
When the relationship of the adverse event cannot be ruled out with certainty the AE may be considered probable or possible related. 
 
Adverse events known to be related to drugs used for supportive treatment will be scored as unrelated. 
 
8.3 Concomitant  medications 
 
Patients treated on this protocol will require supportive care treatment (concomitant medications). These medications are considered standard of care and have no scientific contribution to the protocol; therefore no data will be captured on various medications needed or their side effects. All concomitant meds will be captured in the medical record only. 
 
8.[ADDRESS_886256] guidelines of the Stem Cell Transplantation & Cellular Therapy department.  
Electrolyte and metabolic imbalances, which are considered clinically significant and unexpected in routine stem cell transplant setting and are considered related to Evomela will be 
recorded.  
 
Expected adverse events in post auto transplant period:  
A. Related to myelosuppression: thrombocytopenia, bleeding, platelets and RBC  transfusions.  
B. Fever: Non- neutropenic or neutropenic without  infection.  
C. Infections in the presence or absence of  neutropenia.  
D. Readmissions (lasting <10 days).  
E. Cytopenias post -transplant including secondary graft  failure.  
F. Low blood pressure due to dehydration requiring fluid replacement.  
G. Fluid overload leading to cardiac  dysfunction.  
 
2017-0399 Version 11.0  11 February 2022  Page 19 of 27 
 
 H. GI related: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,  mucositis. 
I. Organ dysfunction: cardiac, pulmonary, hepatic, CNS and/or renal.  
J. Fatigue.  
K. Neurologic: seizures,  neuropathies.  
L. Stem  Cell Transplant  Syndromes:  Cytokine  Storm,  TTP,  hemorrhagic  cystitis, interstitial 
pneumonitis (including pulmonary  hemorrhage).  
 
Adverse Events Considered Serious:  
A. Graft failure/  rejection.  
B. Prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_46532]/or  organ failure  requiring  extensive 
supportive care (i.e., dialysis, mechanical ventilation).  
C. Readmissions from any cause resulting in a prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (>10  days).  
D. Any expected or unexpected event  resulting in an irreversible  condition and/ or leading to 
death.  
 
Adverse events will be documented in the medical record and entered into the electronic case 
report form  in MD Anderson Cancer Center’s Clinical Oncology Research system 
(CORe) /BMTWeb. All other protocol specific data will be entered into BMTWeb /CORe.  
 
8.5 Dose Limiting Toxicity (For dose finding in Stage I) 
 
Toxicity will be defined as grade 4 mucositis or any grade 4 or 5 non- hematologic or 
non-infectious toxicity occurring within 30 days from the start of the infusion. 
 
8.6 Serious Adverse Event Reporting (SAE)  
 
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of either 
the investigator or the sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
 
• Death 
• A life -threatening adverse drug experience – any adverse experience that places the 
patient, in the view of the initial reporter, at immediate risk of death from the adverse 
experience as it occurred.  It does  not include an adverse experience that, had it occurred in 
a more severe form, might have caused death.  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• A persistent  or significant  incapacity  or substantial  disruption of the ability  to conduct  normal 
life functions.  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life- threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse (21 CFR 312.32).  
 
• Important  medical  events  as defined above may also be considered serious  adverse events. 
Any important medical event can and should be reported as an SAE if deemed appropriate 
by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_9476], IND  Office.  
 
 
2017-[ADDRESS_886257] 
be reported to the IRB in accordance with the timeframes and procedures outlined in “The 
University of [LOCATION_007] M. D. Anderson Cancer Center Institutional Review Board Policy for 
Investigators on Reporting Unanticipated Adverse Events for Drugs and Devices”. Unless stated 
otherwise in the protocol, all SAEs, expected or unexpected, must be reported to the IND Office, 
regardless of attribution (within 5 working days of knowledge of the event).  
 
• All life -threatening or fatal events, that are unexpected, and related to the study drug, must 
have a written  report  submitted  within  24 hours  (next  working  day) of knowledge of the event 
to the Safety Project Manager in the IND Office. If a death is possibly related to study agent administration, we will hold study enrollment and agent administration pending assessment of the event.  
• The electronic  SAE application (eSAE)  will be utilized  for safety  reporting to the IND Office, 
IRB, and Acrotech Biopharma . 
• Serious adverse events will be captured from the time of the first protocol -specific 
intervention, until [ADDRESS_886258] dose of drug, unless the participant withdraws consent/assent.  Serious  adverse events  must  be followed  until clinical recovery  is complete 
and laboratory tests have returned to baseline, progression of the event has stabilized, or there has been acceptable resolution of the event.  
• Additionally,  any serious  adverse events  that occur  after the [ADDRESS_886259] be reported to the IND  Office.  
 
8.7 Assessment of the Adverse Events Severity  
 
The severity of the adverse events (AEs) will be graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria v5.0 (CTCAE) from the day of Evomela infusion up to 30 days after the Evomela 
infusion. Events not included in the CTCAE chart will be scored as follows:  
 
General grading:  
Grade 1: Mild: discomfort present with no disruption of daily activity, no treatment required 
beyond prophylaxis.  
Grade 2: Moderate: discomfort present with some disruption of daily activity, require treatment.  
Grade 3: Severe: discomfort that interrupts normal daily activity, not responding to first line 
treatment.  
Grade 4: Life Threatening: discomfort that represents immediate risk of death  
 
Grading for specific syndromes:  
Veno- occlusive disease (VOD):  
Grade 3: Bili >2mg/dl with at least two of the following: increased weight >4% from 
baseline, ascites or hepatomegaly  
Grade 4: pulmonary and or renal failure

+(732) 289 -6189.  
 
9.0 Criteria for Response and Progression 
Disease response, progression, and relapse will be defined according to International Myeloma 
Working Group uniform response criteria (Appendix B).  
 
10.0 Criteria for Removal from the Study  
1. Patient withdrawal of the informed consent.  
2. Patient's  inability  or unwillingness  to have follow- up visits  and/or  laboratory  tests  required by 
[CONTACT_3181].  
3. An unexpected toxicity that is deemed unacceptable by [CONTACT_657362].  
4. Disease  progression.  
5. After one year post stem cell  transplant.  
 
Patients who experience an unexpected toxicity that is deemed unacceptable by [CONTACT_079]  [INVESTIGATOR_657349].  
 
11.[ADDRESS_886260]. Two doses will be studied, 200 and 225 
mg/m2. Two infusion schedules will be studied, 30- 60 minutes and 8 -9 hours, which we will 
refer to below as schedules 1 and 2, respectively. For dose -finding in stage 1, toxicit y will be 
defined as grade 4 mucositis, or any grade 4 or 5 non- hematologic or non- infectious toxicity 
occurring within 30 days from the start of infusion. Complete response will be defined as negative immunofixation on the serum and urine and disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas and < 5% plasma cells in bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_4026].  Schedule selection in stage 
2 is based on complete remission at day 90 (CR90). Secondary outcomes will include overall 
survival (OS) time and progression free survival (PFS ) time.  
 
Stringent complete response (sCR) will be defined as complete response as defined above plus normal FLA ratio and absence of clonal cells in bone marrow biopsy by [CONTACT_9064].  
 
11.2.  Stage I Dose- Finding  Design  
 
11.2.[ADDRESS_886261] been accrued. The randomization will be restricted so that the sample size is 
perfectly balanced between the 2 schedules, with 15 patients in each schedule at n=30, and 30 patients in each schedule at n=60 patients. Within each schedule, the adaptive BMA -CRM[19] 
decision rules (either choose a dose or stop accrual in that schedule due to excessive toxicity at 
 
2017-[ADDRESS_886262] dose d=200) will be applied for each new cohort of [ADDRESS_886263] to the 
constraints given below, in section 11.2.2. If a schedule is terminated early, then, up to the total 
overall maximum of 60, thereafter patients will be treated with the remaining schedule. If both 
schedules are terminated early, then the trial will be stopped. 
 
11.2.2 Phase I BMA -CRM Adaptive Decision  Rules  
 
The same phase I dose- finding design will be used for each schedule. This will be an 
application of the Bayesian Model Averaging continual reassessment method (BMA -CRM)[19], 
with target  toxicity  probability  .20, cohort  size 3, the three CRM  model  probability  skeletons  (.10, 
.21), (.05, .08), and (.07, .15), maximum sample size 30 (10 cohorts of 3 patients each), and the 
first cohort treated at 200 mg/m2. Denoting the probability of toxicity at dose 200 by p(200), 
accrual will be stopped early due to excessive toxicity for a schedule, with no dose selected for 
that schedule, if Pr[ p(200) > .20 | data ] > .90, that is, if the lowest dose is too toxic. The 
operating characteristics (OCs) were computed using the BMA -CRM application (version 2.2.3) 
from the MDACC Biostatistics dep artment . Based on a simulation with 1000 replications per 
scenario, assuming maximum sample size 30, accrual rate 3 per month, 50% toxicities 
observed in the second half of the assessment period, the within- schedule operating 
characteristics of this design are as follows. If a schedule receives > 30 patients due to early termination of the other schedule, then the OCs for the remaining schedule will be improved over the tabulated values.

11.5 Statistical Data Analysis Plan  
 
Toxicity will be tabulated by [CONTACT_2715], type, and grade. The probability of toxicity over 30 days as a 
function of dose will be estimated by [CONTACT_6486] a Bayesian binary outcome regression model 
(Gelman, et al.)[20]. The times for overall survival (OS) and progress- free survival (PFS) will be 
computed from the date of Evomela injection to the last time of follow -up or the event of interest 
(progression or death). Unadjusted OS and PFS distributions will be estimated by [CONTACT_657363] [21]. The posterior probabilities of transplant related mortality (TRM), minimal  
residual disease (MRD), and CR 90 will be estimated along with 95% posterior credible intervals, 
assuming beta (.50, .50) priors. The probabilities of TRM, MRD, and CR90 from the two infusion schedules will also be compared using posterior probabilities of the form Pr(p1 < p2 | data), 
where pj denotes the probability of the event with schedule j=1,2, based on the data for patients 
treated at the optimal within- schedule dose chosen by [CONTACT_657364] -CRM . 
 
11.6 Toxicity/Efficacy Summary Reports  
The Investigator is responsible for completing toxicity/efficacy summary reports and submitting them to the IND office Medical Affairs and Safety Group for review. These should be submitted 
as follows:  
 
Phase I (Dose Finding)/Phase II (Efficacy Assessment)  
 
Toxicity Summary, after the first cohort of [ADDRESS_886266] be 
obtained prior to advancing/changing dose levels.  
During every submission update the response data of previously submitted patients once they 
complete 90 days of treatment.  
 
 
A copy of the cohort summary should be placed in the Investigator’s Regulatory Binder under 
“sponsor correspondence”.

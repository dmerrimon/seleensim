pathways among a cohort of individuals receiving an autologous  hematopoietic stem cell transplant 
(HCT) for multiple myeloma.  
 Primary Objective:  The primary objective of this study is to assess whether beta -blocker administration to individuals 
undergoing HCT alters genome -wide transcriptional 
pathways involved in beta- adrenergic signaling.  
 
Secondary Objectives:  Explore the impact of socioeconomic status, 
depression, and anxiety  on gene expression as well 
as on the relationship between be ta-blocker and 
gene expression; assess clinical feasibility and 
efficacy.

multiple myeloma who are ≤ [ADDRESS_594193] a stem cell 
graft with >2.0 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg available for 
transplant. Patients are excluded if they have had a prior autologous HCT, are on a beta- blocker at the 
time of study entry, h ave a previous intolerance to 
beta- blockers, have any medical contraindications 
to beta-blockers therapy, or have active depression. 
  
Treatment Description:  Patients enrolled in this study will be randomized to either receive propranolol or not starting 7 (± 2) 
days prior to transplant and continuing through [ADDRESS_594194]                                                  Protocol v 3.0, January 15, 2016

1.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE : 
 1.1 Beta- adrenergic signaling in the tumor microenvironment  
 
Research suggests  beta- adrenergic signaling regulates multiple cellular processes that 
contribute to the initiation and progression of cancer, including inflammation, angiogenesis, apoptosis/anoikis, cell motility and trafficking, activation of tumor-associated viruses, DNA damage repair, cellular immune response, and ep ithelial–
mesenchymal transition.
1 Within the tumor microenvironment, beta- adrenergic receptors 
on tumor and stromal cells are activated by [CONTACT_463831] (norepi[INVESTIGATOR_238]) and circulating blood (epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]). Studies of beta- adrenergic 
influence on tumor biology were motivated by [CONTACT_14198][INVESTIGATOR_463820].
2, 
3 In several experimental cancer models, activation of the sympathetic nervous system 
(SNS) has been shown to promote the metastasis of solid epi[INVESTIGATOR_463821] -adrenoreceptor –mediated 
pathways.[ADDRESS_594197] linked the use of beta-blockers to reduced rates 
of progression for several solid tumors.5-9 Recently, a retrospective case-control study of 
MM patients identified that concurrent use of any beta-blocker is associated with more 
favorable 5 -year overall and disease- specific survival.10 Preclinical pharmacologic and 
biomarker studies in animals are now laying the groundwork for translation of beta-blockade as a novel adjuvant to existing therapeutic strategies in clinical oncology, linking the use of beta- adrenergic antagonists (beta-blockers) with reduced dis ease 
progression in humans.
4-9, 11-17 Further, propranolol, a non- selective beta- adrenergic 
receptor blocker, has apoptotic and anti- proliferative ef fects on multiple myeloma (MM) 
cells.[ADDRESS_594198] studied nonselective beta- blocker;[ADDRESS_594199] any significant drug interactions with the more common antineoplastic (melphalan) and infection -related 
drugs utilized to treat MM.  
 The first 30 days following autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) generally constitute the ti me period around transplantation of greatest psychological and 
physiological stress and inflammatory processes.
21, [ADDRESS_594200] demonstrated propranolol serum concentrations of 20 ng/ml (range 0.16-0.26 ng/ml) (Sloan, personal communication) with sustained -release propranolol 
0.5mg over 21 days to be effective in beta- blockade mediated mitigation of stress -
induced tumor progression/metastases.
25 Animal to human dosing may be converted 
using the dose translation formula based on body surface area where human equivalent dose (HED) (mg/kg) = animal dose (mg/kg) multiplied by [CONTACT_328629] K m/Human  Km 
(where animal K m = 3, human K m = 37).
26 The HED is 122 mg/day or 142 mg/day for a 
60 kg and 70 kg human, respectively. However, the 0.5 mg dose is not a single-dose; therefore, with the sustained-release formulation the HED could be as low as 6 mg/day or 7 mg/day, respectively. The actual HED is likely near the midpoint of the low and high values calculated, whi ch would be [ADDRESS_594201] cancer progression. Both 20mg and 40mg of propranolol 
(one administration of a twice daily administration regimen) are effective for anxiolysis.
[ADDRESS_594202]  on gene expression  
 
Stress -induced beta-adrenergic signaling within the tumor microenvironment also results 
in alterations in SNS -mediated gene expression; this was identified in an ovarian cancer 
cohort of [ADDRESS_594203] complete remission (N=78) under 
conditions of increased stress as measured by [CONTACT_463832]  (SES) 
(unpublished data). These changes associated with low SES are reciprocally associated with increased relapse and leukemia- free survival  (unpublished data). It is unknown, 
however, whether a nervous system-targeted intervention such as beta- blocker therapy 
would affect change at the level of gene expression.  
 Evaluating a molecular outcome  with the magnitude of data that is available as with gene 
expression studies allows us to assess biobehaviorally- mediated biological changes 
between two differing groups utilizing a small coho rt, as has been done previously.
31, [ADDRESS_594204] for MM by [CONTACT_17801] a daily beta -blocker (propranolol) 
to [ADDRESS_594205] alters genome-wide transcriptional pathways involved in beta- adrenergic signaling.  
 
2.2 Secondary Objectives 
 
The secondary objectives of this study are:  
  1) To explore additional gene expression endpoints including:  
  a) the impact of  SES, depression, and anxiety on gene expression as well  
  as on the relationship between beta-blocker administration and gene  
  expression profiles   
     2) To assess clinical feasibility and efficacy by  
  a ) testing the feasibility (adherence, tolerance) of using beta -blockers  
  with an intensive conventional antineoplastic treatment reg imen   
  (autologous HCT) in a cancer population    b) describing  meaningful clinical endpoints between the intervention vs.  
  control arms including depression and anxiety, proportion of

4. Previous intolerance to beta-blocker therapy 
5. Any medical contraindications to beta-blocker therapy including, but not limited 
to, symptomatic hy potension; drug hypersensitivity; sinus bradycardia, sick sinus 
syndrome, or [ADDRESS_594208] degree atrioventricular block without a pacemaker; 
uncompensated heart failure; or uncontrolled asthma  
6. Active, untreated depression screened for  by [CONTACT_463833]  (Patients who

2.4 Treatment Plan 
 
The study drug will be dispensed. C ompliance will be monitored by [CONTACT_132061] (CRC) . Beta- blocker tolerability will be assessed clinically  by [CONTACT_463834] a weekly basis and for 1 week following cessation of beta-blocker therapy ; 
subjects will be questioned about specific side effects as well as assessed for blood pressure and heart rate during weekly appointments or by [CONTACT_648].

 11 2.4.1 Beta-blocker dosing schedule  
 
We will take a conservative appr oach by [CONTACT_463835] 20 mg orally twice 
daily  for a week at the time of study commencement ( Day -7 ± [ADDRESS_594209] to day 
of transplant being Day 0; nomenclature throughout protocol continues as such; see Figure 1) in an effort to minimize cardiac effects  in this medically ill population . The 
study PI [INVESTIGATOR_463822] [ADDRESS_594210] a heart rate of 
< 50, a blood pressure of < 90/55, significant fatigue impairing their function, or signs or symptoms of congestive heart failure, they will be taken off propranolol. If they have any noticeable side effects but  are less severe than described above and the patient is able to 
tolerate staying on propranolol, their dose will be held at 20mg twice daily. If particip ants 
are tolerating propranolol without any side effects, they will be increased to 40mg twice daily. The maximum dose will be [ADDRESS_594211] patients. This should coordinate well with Sloan’s murine model that demonstrated anti-tumor effects at a serum level of 20 ng/ml and should maxi mize the 
likelihood of effecting change at the level of gene expression.   
 Patients taking antihypertensive medications will be monitored in the same manner as the other study participants with regular  blood pressure and heart rate assessments. If patients 
already taking antihypertensive medication(s) develop low blood pressure on propranolol, 
their antihypertensive medication will be lowered and the propranolol dose will be continued as tolerated . Similarly, as the study drug is weaned, their antihypertens ive 
medication(s) will be titrated as necessary.  
 2.4.2 Study interruption  Participants needing to stop beta-blocker therapy secondary to intolerance or new onset of a contraindication will not be considered for resumption of therapy. Outcome and 
medical data will continue to be collected and assessed for intervention arm participants despi[INVESTIGATOR_463823]-blocker therapy for the study duration.   2.4.3 Beta -blocker weaning 
 Beta-blocker will be weaned for one of three reasons: 1) completion of drug intervention 
(28 ± [ADDRESS_594212]-transplant), 2) intolerance secondary to side effects, or 3) onset of new 
medical symptoms rendering beta -blocker therapy as contraindicated (see section 2.3.2).

2.5 Study Drug Information 
 
Propranolol is highly protein bound (89%) and undergoes extensive first- pass metabolism 
(hepatic extraction ratio 0.7 -0.9) yielding nonrestrictive elimination where the hepatic 
extraction ratio is greater than the amount of unbound drug. This results in significant 
intra-patient variability.  At higher doses used to achieve serum concentrations >30 ng/ml, 
propra nolol manifests linear kinetics.
30, 37 Owing to this unique pharmacokinetic profile it 
is difficult to calculate a predicted serum concentration.  However, given that a mouse 
serum concentration target of 20 ng/ml has been established and that this theoretically correlates with target human serum concentration,
25, 38 we can apply human dose-finding 
studies to determine HED need to achieve said concentration. At a dose of 120 mg/day 
mean serum trough concentrations have been reported as 54 
  34 ng/ml and 41.[ADDRESS_594214]                                                  P r o t o c o l  v 3. 0 ,  Ja nua r y  15 ,  20 16

The study intervention will be deemed  feasible if both of the below parameters for enrollment and retention are met. 
 3.2.2.1a Enrollment rate  
 Based on similar biobehavioral cancer research efforts at other institutions, the target 
enrollment rate is 55-70%.  Of all eligible patients that are  approached, the goal is that 55-
70% will provide informed consent and enroll in the study. This target rate also takes into account the possibility that enrollment may be slightly lower due to the present study being a drug intervention trial with  potenti al patient reticence to enroll.  
  3.2.2.1b Retention rate  
 Based on similar research and the nature of drug intervention trial s (as described in 
3.2.2.1a ), the target retention rate is 65-70%. Retention rate will be assessed individually 
for two time periods - prior to transplant (between Time 1 and Time 2) and from transplant through Day +30 (Time 2 to Time 3). This allows for assessing the impact on gene expression in both a run-in period preceding transplantation as well as during the transplant process, whereby [CONTACT_463836] a greater number of confounding variables that may potentially impact gene expression and adherence. Participants will be considered to be retained in the study for the given time period assessment if they are 80% adherent to their prescribed dose of medication during the specified time period. 
 Drug adherence will be measured  as a percentage of the prescribed  number of pi[INVESTIGATOR_463824]  (either 20  mg or 40 mg twice daily) . This will be determined 
outpatient via pi[INVESTIGATOR_463825] -2 and Day +[ADDRESS_594217] for what constitutes adequate adherence. Clinical trials report average adherence rates of 43 to 78 percent among patients taking drugs for chronic conditions ; some clinical tria ls define 
rates above 80%  as acceptable.
43 A target adherence rate of 80%  will be utilized in this 
study to constitute having adequately retained the patient in the study. Adherence will be recorded as a continuous (0-100%) variable. Adherence will be assessed separately 
during two time periods – prior to transplant (between Time 1 and Time 2) and from transplant through Day +28 (Time 2 to Time 3). Patients will be included in final analyses if and only if they have been adherent (at l east 80% of the prescribed dose) to 
the study drug during the designated time period.  As the retention rate (participants’ ability or inability to be maintained on the study drug) will necessarily be affected by [CONTACT_99766], we will collect side effect data to better

Calendar collection of adverse events (AEs) will be obtained through toxicity forms (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] ) completed weekly until neutrophil engraftment occurs (absolute neutrophil 
count > 500/mm
3 for ≥3 consecutive days) and bi- weekly thereafter  until the study 
endpoint at Week 6 (See Tables 2a and 2b). Further details about AE monitoring are included in Section 4.3.  [IP_ADDRESS] Outcomes 
• Depression and anxiety: as assessed by [CONTACT_183535], with scores of 8 or above on 
HADS -A (7 items) and HADS -D (7 items) defining significant anxiety or 
depression, respectively.42 Depression and anxiety will be described both overall 
and between treatment vs. control groups.  
• Engraftment syndrome : presence of fever, diarrhea, or rash within 48 hours before 
or after neutrophil recovery that requires steroids for treatmen t. This will be 
determined at the discretion of the treating physician  and will be categorized as 
yes/no . 
• Neutrophil engraftment: time to absolute neutrophil count (ANC) > 0.5 x 109/L 
sustained for three consecutive assessments at least one day apart. 
• Platelet engraftment: time to achieve a platelet count of (a) >20 x 109/L 
independent of platelet transfusions for [ADDRESS_594220] one day apart . 
• Infection:  number of documented culture positive infections or neutropenic fever 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_463826] >100.4 degrees F. 
• Response to treatment :  The trial will assess the rates of very good partial 
response ( VGPR ) or better (near complete response (nCR) , CR, and stringent CR 
(sCR) ) according to the International Uniform Response Criteria at day [ADDRESS_594221]. 
• Treatment -Related Mortality (T RM): TRM is defined as death occurring in a 
patient from causes other than disease progression. TRM will be assessed at D100

 17 for both the intervention and control arms. Patients alive and progression -free at 
100 days will be censored. 
• Progression- Free S urvival (PFS) : Progression (for patients not in CR) is defined 
as increase of serum paraprotein by 0.5 g /dL compared to pre- transplant levels , 
increase in 24 hour urine protein electrophoresis ≥  200 mg compared to pre-
transplant levels , absolute increase in the difference between involved and 
uninvolved FLC levels of >10 mg/dl (only in patients without measurable 
paraprotein in the serum and urine ), >25% increase in plasma cells in a bone 
marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_207097] ( must also be an absolute increase of at 
least 10% ), increase in the size of exi sting bone lesions or soft tissue 
plasmacytomas, d evelopment of new bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas, 
development of hypercalcemia (corrected serum Ca >11.5 mg/dL or >2.8 
mmol/L) not attributable to any other cause.  Development of a compression 
fracture does not exclude continued response and may not indicate progression. PFS will be compared between the two arms  as a time to event endpoint censored 
after [ADDRESS_594222].  
• Overall S urvival (OS) : The event is death from any cause. The time to this event 
is the time from randomization to death, loss to follow -up or the end of [ADDRESS_594223] the documentation of patient consent and

including a signed informed consent/HIPAA and signed eligibility checklist, will be available, reviewed  and eligibility verified . At the point of registration, a member of the 
study te am will register the patient in the electronic database, including demographic s, 
consent and on-study information. The patient will be assigned a unique sequence 
number for the study. The principal i nvestigator (PI)  of the study, [CONTACT_182348], will be 
notified prior to enrollment.  Pharmacy will be notified upon patient registration. If at any 
point in time a patient wishes to withdraw from the study, they may notify [CONTACT_182348] 
verbally or in writing. There will be no further data collection for participants who el ect 
to withdraw from the study.

 18 Target enrollment is  40 (20 per group) and includes patients undergoing autologous HCT 
for MM at MCW. H alf of the participants will be randomized via permuted block 
assignment with random block sizes to receive propranolol upon study entry. I nformed 
consent will be obtained  to access participants’ full medical records to ascertain relevant 
demographic and medical data as outlined in Section 4.2. The patient must have signed 
informed consent prior to registration on the study. Due to the pi[INVESTIGATOR_328627], the need to monitor response to prophylactic beta- blocker usage in a 
medically ill population, as well as the objective nature of gene expression profiling, this pi[INVESTIGATOR_328628]. Patients will be enrolled  before study commencement at 
Day -7. Total study duration will be up to 7 weeks for participants assigned to the 
intervention group ([ADDRESS_594224]-transplant) and 5 weeks for those in the control arm ([ADDRESS_594225]-transplant). Additional clinical information will be collected for [ADDRESS_594226]- transplant as identified 
in section [IP_ADDRESS].

   4.[ADDRESS_594228], grades 3- 5 AEs will be collected at different time points 
during the study period. Any AE that fulfill this criterion  will be captured and the 
frequency of each organ toxicity tabulated. The Data and Safety Monitoring Committee 
(DSMC ) and IRB will receive a summary of all the AEs captured in calendar forms in a 
quarterly to biennial basis depending the schedule of protocol review meetings. Additionally the PIs will review the frequency of toxicities in a quarterly basis.  
 Second, any AE that is unexpected an d of grades 3 to 5 will require expedited report to 
the oversight committees (MCW IRB, MCW DSMC and FDA – if applicable  for studies 
under IND). The collection grades 3-5 unexpected AEs is event driven and requires a more comprehensi ve description of the event. The report for these AEs are termed 
Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSR) and include the following components: 1) summary cover sheet of the event, 2 ) narrative of the event, 3 ) associated conditions, 
medications and diagnostic information, source documents with further explanation of the even t, and an evaluatio n of the event by [CONTACT_978]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_463827]. If they are considered grades 3-5 and unexpected the report will be sent to the oversight committees within three days from acknowledgement of the event. If the event is not considered to fulfill criteria of grades 3-5 unexpected AE, it will be included in the DSMC and IRB reports for scheduled protocol reviews and will not require expedited reporting.   Reporting timelines: 
1. Fatal  (grade 5) or Life Threatening events must be reported within 24 hours 
but not later than three calendar day s of the investigator’s observation or 
awareness of the event.  
2. All oth er events grades 3 -4 unexpected events (non- fatal/non life -threatening) 
must be reported within 3 to 5 calendar days of the investigator’s observation or awareness of the event.

 20 This study will be reviewed by [CONTACT_463838] (MCW CC DSMC). A summary of the MCW CC DSMC 
activities are as follows:  • Review the clinical trials for data integrity and safety  
• Review all adverse events requiring expedited reporting as defined per protocol • Review all Data and Safety Monitoring ( DSM ) reports 
• Submit a summary of any recommendations related to study conduct • Terminate the study if deemed unsafe for patients  
 A copy of the MCW CC DSM Plan and membership roster will be maintained in the 
DSMC  file and  updated as membership changes. The committee will review reports from 
the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_182168] (or more frequently if needed) and provide recommendations on trial continuation, suspension or termination as necessary. Any available DSMC letters will be submitted to the IRB of record as required. 
 4.4 Specimen C ollection  
 The Cancer Center Lab draw blood to be stored in PAXGene RNA tubes at three study 
time points as described in Table 4.7b. These time points include baseline (Day -7), Day -
2 (immediately prior to transplant , central line placement, or administration of any  
conditioning regimen), and Day +28. Blood will be drawn at one of two locations: in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (if participants are immediately post- transplant and/or still or re -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057] ) or 
in the transplant clinic  during their regular visits.  The PAXGene RNA tubes do not 
require any additional processing of blood samples before being frozen and sent to UCLA. These PAXGene RNA tubes will be stored at -80C in the Neuroscience Research 
Center, which is a locked facility,  until they are batched and shipped to University of 
[LOCATION_004] Los A ngeles (UCLA)  for gene expression analysis. Before being stored they 
will be assigned a dummy ID that will be the sole identifier of the samples. The linked identifiers will be stored on a secure computer network through the CIBMTR under the PI’s name. Samples will be packaged with dry ice and shipped overnight to [CONTACT_463845]’s lab at UCLA  at the time of study conclusion . This will be done on a day such that 
the UCLA lab can receive and keep the samples frozen at -80C. Our groups have 
collaborated successfully on transfer of samples in the past. A ll samples will be sent 
together.  
4.5 Gene Expression P rofiling  
 
The UCLA Social Genomics Core (Directed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Steve Cole, Consultant) will conduct all gene expression profiling on obtained blood samples by [CONTACT_381299] -[ADDRESS_594229] suitable mass (by [CONTACT_90332]) and integrity (by [CONTACT_381300]) for analysis, and subjected to microarray target synthesis and hybridization in collaboration with the UCLA Neuroscience Genomics Core Laboratory using standard Illumina assay equipment and protocols.  The output of these analyses is quantification of whole genome

 21 RNA production, which will be analyzed as per the methods below  (section 5.4.1). 
Patient -level  genetic data from [CONTACT_463846] ’s lab will not be conveyed to the patient or the 
clinician and  no clinical decision wi ll be made on the basis of genetic findings.  
  
4.6 Psychosocial A ssessment s 
 
4.6.1 Socioeconomic status  SES will be  assessed by [CONTACT_463839]. This information 
will be collected from participants at baseline/time of study enrollment. The 2012 median family income in Wisconsin was $51,059 (US median was $51,371) according to the US American Community Survey ( http://www.census.gov/prod/2013pubs/acsbr12-02.pdf
) 
with the poverty threshold of $23,050 for a four-person family. Thus, we categorized 
family income as <$23,000, $23,000-$34,999, $35,000-$44,999, $45,000-$54,999, $55,000-$64,999, $65,000-$74,999, >$75,000. Education level (< high school vs. high school graduate vs. some post high school education vs. college degree vs. professional degree) will also be collected but not used as the primary indicator of SES in analyses. 
 4.6.2 Anxiety and depression  Participants will complete a HADS for primary analysis with gene expression at three 
study time points as described in Table 4.7b. These time points include baseline (Day -21), Day -2 (i mmediately prior to  conditioning regimen), and Day +28. Further, HADS 
will be administered/assessed weekly in coordination with weekly beta-blocker assessment to ascertain further whether the beta- blocker might be affecting depression or 
anxiety.  
 HADS  is a 14 -item scale that generates ordinal data and is specifically designed to avoid 
reliance on somatic symptoms that are concomitant with medical illness. Participants can score between 0 and 21 for e ither anxiety or depression. Each item is scored on a scale of 
0-3. A cut-off point of 8 or above on HADS- A (7 items) and HADS -D (7 items) has been 
established to connote significant anxiety or depression, respectively .

5.1 Study D esign  
 
5.1.1 Accrual  
 
It is estimated that 9 months – 1 year will be necessary to enroll the targeted sample size.  
 5.1.2 Primary Endpoint  The primary endpoint is Day +28 (4 weeks) following HCT for MM, with intervention 
arm patients followed for an additional 1-[ADDRESS_594235] size estimates and 95% confidence intervals to aid with planning future r esearch projects. We will generate both simple estimates of 
effect size as well as adjusted estimates, attempting to control for any accidental confounding that may occur despi[INVESTIGATOR_39470].  
5.3 Analysis of Primary E ndpoints  
  
5.3.1 Gene Expression Profiling  The final outcome for the gene expression analysis will be expression levels of the group of genes comprising the conserved transcriptional response to adversity (CTRA) profile. The CTRA profile represents a systemic shift in ba sal gene expression profiles among 
circulating immune cells during extended periods of stress, threat, or uncertainty consistent with the physiology of stress- associated illness.
32-36 This profile is 
characterized by 53-genes and includes up- regulated  expr ession of pro- inflammatory 
genes ( IL1A, IL1B, IL6, IL8, TNF, PTGS1, PTGS2, FOS, FOSB, FOSL1, FOSL2, JUN, 
JUNB, JUND, NFKB1, NFKB2, REL, RELA, and RELB) and down-regulated expression 
of genes involved in type I interferon (IFN) responses ( GBP1, IFI16, IFI27, IFI27L1 -2,

with a  residual covariance structure estimated to a ccount for potential correlation among 
the 53 genes. 
 Primary analyses will be performed at the time of all 3 blood draws (Baseline, Day -2, 
and Day +28) and will use general linear model analyses to quantify the association between expression of each of the [ADDRESS_594237] genes and beta-blocker usage. To ensure analysis of  patients with sufficient beta -blocker exposure, only gene expression 
data from study participants with an adherence rate of 80% (at either dose) will be used as comparators against the control group. Descriptive tables of patient -, disease- , and 
transplan t-related factors will be prepared with separate columns by [CONTACT_463840]. no 
propranolol groups. Any demographic or psychosocial variables (other than those of primary interest) that are unevenly distributed between groups after randomization will be adj usted for in subsequent analyses as previously described using ANCOVA. Further, 
differences in gene expression will be compared between groups/variables that might not have been randomly distributed, regardless of beta- blocker treatment assignment, to 
ascertain whether these differences may be stronger than drug -attributed changes.  The 
UCLA Social Genomics core will provide genetic and statistical analyses  for gene 
expression data. 
 
5.4 Analysis of Secondary E ndpoints  
 5.4.1 Gene expression based on psychosocial factors  Subgroup analyses will describe additional psychosocial factors (SES, depression, anxiety) that may result in altered gene expression or differentially affect the response to 
beta-blockers in our proposed cohort. As this study is not powered to formally assess this relationship, these will be exploratory analyses to determine whether there is sufficient signal of a response to merit further exploration in future studies.  
 SES will be  assessed by [CONTACT_463841] 4.6.1. This information will be collected from participants at baseline/time of 
study enrollment. SES will be assessed by [CONTACT_21129] [ADDRESS_594238] – SES, depression, and 
anxiety – with expression of the CTRA gene profile, measured continuously. Beta-
blocker usage will then be entered into this model to ascertain whether it significantly changes the association between SES, depressi on, and anxiety and gene expression as 
measured by [CONTACT_463842]. Significance will be assessed by [CONTACT_463843] (e.g ., SES) to

 [IP_ADDRESS] Outcomes 
• Depression and anxiety:  HADS scores will be tabulated and evaluated 
comprehensively as well as by [CONTACT_265134] -A and HADS -D. The trajectory of these 
scores over the course of the study will be described. Differences in scores between the treatment vs. control groups over the course of the study will be assesse d. 
• Engraftment syndrome: Engraftment syndrome occurrences will be tabulated and 
the incidence described for both treatment and control arms. 
• Neutrophil engraftment: Differences in time to neutrophil engraftment will be 
determined between treatment and control arms.  
• Platelet engraftment: Differences in time to platelet  engraftment will be 
determined between treatment and control arms.  
• Infection:  Infection events will be tabulated and differences in events will be 
determined for treatment and control arms.  
• Response to treatment: The rates of VGPR or better (nCR, CR, and sCR) will be 
calculated at [ADDRESS_594239]-transplant and compared between intervention and control arms.  
• Treatment -Related Mortality (TRM): TRM is defined as death occurring in a 
patient  from causes other than disease progression. Disease progression is a 
competing event for TRM. The time to this event is the time from randomization to death, disease progression, loss to follow-up or the end of [ADDRESS_594240]. Patients alive without disease progression at 
100 days are considered censored. The cumulative incidence of TRM at 100 days will be estimated separately for each treatment -group. Overall TRM through 100 
days of follow-up will be compared using Gray’s test.  
• Progression- free survival (PFS): PFS will be compared between the two arms as a 
time to event endpoint censored after [ADDRESS_594241]- transplant. 
• Overall survival (OS): The event is death from any cause. The time to this event is 
the time from randomization to death, loss to follow -up or the end of [ADDRESS_594242]                                                  Protocol v 3.0, January 15, 2016

 32 Introduction 
Clinical trials that assess interventions in the setting of hematopoietic cell transplantation 
is challenging as the number of expected AEs is high. The Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trial Network (BM T CTN) has establish ed an AE capture approach specific for 
transplant trials. This approach has the objective of optimizing the capture of AEs by [CONTACT_381294]- signal ratio and identifies AEs that are not expected after transplant or 
overlaps with manifestations of common complications, such as GVHD or graft failure.  
 
Definitions  
 
Adverse Event (AE) - Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product, medical treatment or 
procedure and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can considered therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, medical treatment or procedure whether or not related to the medicinal product. AEs are expected in the HCT  population. 
 Expectedness : An adverse event can be Expected or Unexpected  
• Expected adverse events  are those that have been previously identified as 
resulting from administration of the agent. For the purposes of this study, an adverse event is considered expected  when it appears in the current adverse event 
list, the Investigator’s Brochure, the package insert or is included in the informed consent document as a potential risk. 
• Unexpected adverse events  are those that vary in nature, intensity or frequency 
from information in the current adverse event list, the Investigator’s Brochure, the package insert, or when it is not included in the informed consent document as a potential risk.  
 
  
Life-threatening Adverse Event – Any adverse event that places the patient or subject, 
in view of the i nvestigator or treating physicia n, at immediate risk of death from the 
reaction. Study toxicities are graded using the adapted NCI Common Toxicity Criteria (where appropriate use the criteria for transplant patients.)  
    • Serious Adverse Event (SAE) – Any adve rse event occurring that results in any of the 
following o utcomes:  
• death – regardless of cause • life -threat ening adverse event (see above) 
• persistent or si gnificant disability/incapacity  
• congenital anomaly • requires intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage

 33 AE Grading: All AEs that occur in this protocol will be graded according to the NCI 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event (CTCAE) v 4.0.  
 
AE Reporting: Depending on the type, severity and whether it is expected, each AE will 
need to be reported in an appropriate timeline to MCW IRB, Data Safety and Monitoring 
Committee and FDA (if applicable for studies under an Investigational New Drug [IND] protocol).    
 
Adverse Events Reported to the DSMB  
All adverse events that are classified as grades 3 to 5 will be reported to the DSMC. The 
differences are the timing and amount of information associated with each.  
 The two -tier approach collects adverse events at specific time points during the trial 
(calendar -driven) and event-driven upon knowledge of an event deemed serious (grades 3 
to 5) or unexpected to be seen in a transplant setting.  
 
Grades [ADDRESS_594246] transplant.  
 
Unexpected Grades 3 -5 
The threshold for collection of adverse events outside the calendar forms is related to the grade (grades 3 -5) and expectedness related to the transplant procedure or possibly 
related to the s tudy drug. These events are required to be reported to the DSMC in a more 
immediate time frame and also require more information. For any adverse event that meets these criteria, the report would require a narrative of the event, associated laboratory and imaging info rmation, associated medications and any relevant source 
documents. These reports are uploaded into Oncore and we will notify the DSMC chair and MCW IRB within 24 hours or 3 to 5 calendar days depending on the severity of the event.  Both the PI [INVESTIGATOR_381265].   
 Reporting timelines: 
1. Fatal  (grade 5) or Life Threatening events must be reported within 24 hours 
but not later than 3 calendar day of the investigator’s observation or awareness of the event.  
2. All other events grades 3 -4 unexpected events (non- fatal/non life -threatening) 
must be reported within 3 to 5 calendar days of the investigator’s observation or awareness of the event.  
Propranolol  and Gene Expression in HCT                                                  Protocol v 3.0, January 15, 2016  
 34  
 The proposed method outlined here follows the same requirements from MCW IRB for prompt reporting of an event or Unanticipated Problem Involving Risks to Subjects or Others (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_9961]) : which is defined as any incident, experience, or outcome that meets 
all of the following criteria: 
1. Unanticipate d (in terms of nature, severity , or frequency) given (a) the research 
procedures described in the protocol- related documents, such as the IRB -
approved research protocol and informed consent document, instructions for 
Use/Device Manual and or Investigator’s Brochure; and (b) the characteristics of 
the subject population being studies; 
2. Related or possibly related to participation in the research (in this g uidance 
document, possibly related means there is a reasonable possibility that the 
incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_182821] ) or test article; and  
3. Suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously 
known or recognized. 
 
DSMC Reporting  
 
The table below summarizes the reporting practices from the study to the DSMC. For the 
ongoing review of an opened trial, the DSMC will receive a report that includes in a tabular form all the grades 3 to 5 that occurred in the trial, summarized according to reporting periods: for example 0-28d, 28-56d, 56 to 100d, 100-180d, 180-270d, 270 to 365d and 0-365d. Additionally the report will include all the unexpected grades 3-5 that occurred in trial participants since activation of the trial and lastly the number of patients who met the graft failure stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_15381].  
 
For the unexpected grades 3 to 5, upon knowledge of the event, this will be discussed 
with the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_381266]. If this fulfills criteria for expedited reporting to the DSMC and IRB, a narrative will be uploaded in Oncore and the DS MC 
will be notified, either through its secretary or directly to the Chair.  
 
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1869]  
• Unexpected SAEs attributable to drug in excess of 20% would be unacceptable. 
If more than [ADDRESS_594247] (or subsequent) 10 participants enrolled in the trial 
experience a SAE resulting in life threatening complications/death, the trial will be 
stopped.

Investigational Product, Dosage and Mode of Administration : 
 
Prospective Terlipressin Group:  
Collaborative Research  Study , Version 4: 06/29/[ADDRESS_474389] dose, 
then by [CONTACT_100303].   
 
Retrospective Control Group:  
Dose and method of administration for M &O, albumin, or other vasopressor  
 
Dosage and Mode of Administration:  
 
For Retrospective Control Group:  
Dosing for M &O , albumin, or other vasopressor will be reported as it was recorded 
on the subject ’s chart.  
 
For Prospective Terlipressin Group:  
 Terlipressin will be supplied in single -use, sterile 6 -mL vials containing 1 mg of 
lyophilized Terlipressin acetate (equivalent to 0.85 mg Terlipressin free base) with 10 
mg mannitol as a bulking agent/stabilizer.  
 
Initial Dosing:  
2 Terlipressin will be administered intravenously as a bolus injection (the vial will be 
reconstituted with  5 mL of sterile 0.9% sodium chloride solution and given over 
1 minute at a dose of 0.5 mg.   
• Continued dosing will be by 2 mg infusion per day.  For c ontinuous infusion, the 
dose of terlipressin is to be dissolved in 0.9% sodium chloride solution and 
infused with a pump. 
 
Dose Modifications:  
- If on Day 3 the SCr is not 30% lower from the baseline value, increase infusion 
dose to 4 mg per day.  
 
- If on D ay 5 the SCr is not 50% lower from the baseline value , increase infusion 
dose to 6- 8 mg per day , per PI [INVESTIGATOR_9106] . Dosing can  be increased by [CONTACT_726] 
1 mg increment at D ay 5 or beyond, up to a maximum of 8 mg/day . 
 
• If the subject has infusion stopped for ≥ 4 hours, a 0.5 mg bolus should be given 
prior to restarting infusion.   
• The drug should not be used in subjects with severe coronary artery disease or in 
the setting of circulatory overload, pulmonary edema, or bronchospasm as 
determined by [CONTACT_737]. If drug therapy has been initiated, Investigator 
can also decide not to increase the dose, based on the patient ’s status with regard 
to the above, based on individual subject condition.

University of Pennsylvania  Page 15 of 69 Confidential and Proprietary  • If dosing is interrupted due to an adverse event, terlipressin may be re -started, at 
the discretion of the investigator, at the same or lower dose as per protocol. 
Terlipressin will not be restarted if dosing was  interrupted due to cardiac 
ischemia or mesenteric ischemia.  
 
Treatment Discontinuation:  
• Terlipressin may be continued until [ADDRESS_474390] value possible as determined by [INVESTIGATOR_678], up to a 
maximum of 14 days.  
• After a  minimum of [ADDRESS_474391] final dose escalation and tolerability , if the SCr 
is at or above enrollment value, t erlipressin should be discontinued.  
• If 72 hours after final dose escalation, there is no further improvement in SCr, 
continuation of terlipressin is at the discretion of the Principal Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_378876] . 
• If a subject is initiated on RRT, terlipressin can be continued for a maximum of 72 
hours after initiation of RRT . 
• Terlipressin must be discontinued when the subject is to undergo liver 
transplantation, TIPS,  or any other vasopressor therapy (single admi nistration of 
vasopressor for cardiac stress test is acceptable)  
• Dosing must be permanently discontinued if an event of cardiac ischemia or 
mesenteric ischemia occurs.  
 
Retreatment:  
If judged by [CONTACT_36688], subjects who demonstrate at 
least a partial response during the initial treatment course (at least 50% reduction in 
SCr) and develop recurrence of HRS -AKI may be retreated for a maximum of 
[ADDRESS_474392] again meet the study 
inclusion/exclusion criteria. Retreatment may occur within [ADDRESS_474393] ’s 
first dose of t erlipressin.  
Duration of Treatment:  
For the Prospective Terlipressin G roup, the active tr eatment period will be up to 14 days, 
allowing 1  retreatment cycle.  
For both Prospective and Retrospective Subjects:  
All subjects will be followed: 
Post treatment clinical data collection will be through phone call and chart review.

University of Pennsylvania  Page 24 of 69 Confidential and Proprietary  3 Introduction  
3.1 Hepatorenal Syndrome  
Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) Type 1, a potentially reversible renal failure, is a serious, rapi[INVESTIGATOR_180856], fatal orphan disease complicating decompensated chronic liver disease associated 
with cirrhosis ( Arroyo , 1996; Salerno , 2007; Angeli , 2015). The  estimated [LOCATION_002] (US) 
annual incidence for HRS Type 1 ranges between 9,000 and 20,000 patients ( Marrero, 2003; 
Muir, 2002; Murkerj ee, 2002; National Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_36669] 2005), establishing it as an 
orphan disease. The death rate from chronic liver disease and cirrhosis has been r ising, while the 
death rates for other major diseases such as stroke, cancer, heart disease, and diabetes have gone 
down in the past 15 years ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2013; Ma , 2015).  
As indicated in the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) Guidelines, 
at present, there is no available pharmacological therapy ( i.e., approved or proven) in the US or 
Canada for HRS Type 1 ( Runyon, 2013) and there remains a significant unmet need.  
An increasing body of knowledge of the pathophysiology of HRS Type 1 has demonstrated that 
vasoconstrictive drug therapy may improve renal function in HRS Type 1 ( Salerno , 2007; 
European Association for the Study of the Liver 2010). Terlipressin has been extensively studied 
as a splanchnic vasoconstrictor for the treatment of HRS Type [ADDRESS_474403] of care for  
this condition wherever the drug is available ( European Association for the Study of the Liver 
2010). Although there has been some off -label use of other vasoconstrictors, a recent study has 
shown that the most  commonly used agents ( i.e., combination of midodrine and octreotide) are 
not effective ( Cavallin , 2015).  
There is a shift  in HRS terminology to move away from HRS Type 1 and HRS Type 2 to the new 
designations of HRS -Acute  Kidney Injury (HRS -AKI) and HRS -Chronic Kidney D isease (HRS -
CKD) , respectively, in order to better harmonize with the existing nomenclature in nephrology, 
the clinical consequences of kidney injury, and initiation of treatment at earlier time poi nts when 
it is more effective ( Angeli , 2015). HRS -AKI removes the condition of creatinine doubling over 
two weeks, as often patients with ascites, a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_124372], and HRS physiology may not 
have had a creatinine checked in the preceding two weeks but would still benefit from HRS 
treatment.  Additionally, HRS -AKI divides the kidney injury into stages (1- 3) to mirror the AKI 
criteria set forth by [CONTACT_378888] (AKIN)  (Angeli , 2015) . 
 
 
Collaborative Research  Study , Version 4: 06/29/21  
To Treat HRS -AKI Patients with Continuous Terlipressin  Infusion  
 
University of Pennsylvania  Page 25 of 69 Confidential and Proprietary  3.2 Terlipressin  
Terlipressin is a synthetic vasopressin analogue that acts as a systemic vasoconstrictor via the 
vascular vasopressin V 1 receptors. In HRS patients the strong V 1 receptor -mediated 
vasoconstrictor activity of terlipress in, particularly in the splanchnic area, increases effective 
intravascular volume and mean arterial pressure (MAP), ameliorates renin -angiotensin -
aldosterone system and sympathetic nervous system hyperactivity, and improves renal blood 
flow. These correcti ve hemodynamic effects culminate in improved renal function, thereby 
[CONTACT_378889] ( Arroyo , 2000; 
Ginès , 2003; Kiszka -Kanowitz , 2004).  
After intravenous (IV) administration of terlipressin, the glycyl residues of terlipressin are 
cleaved by [CONTACT_36692]. Thus, terlipressin levels in the blood decrease rather 
rapid ly and the pharmacologically active metabolite lysine -vasopressin is released gradually 
from tissues into the circulation.   Intravenous terlipressin can be delivered quickly via bolus 
injection or slowly through continuous infusion.  There is evidence that  continuous infusion 
leads to fewer adverse events and lower total terlipressin doses to achieve HRS reversal  
(Cavallin,  2016).  A bolus injection prior to continuous infusion will achieve therapeutic levels 
earlier than continuous infusion alone . 
Terlipressin is approved in many countries and regions outside the US where it has been a 
standard of care for decades in the treatment of subjects with liver cirrhosis and esophageal 
variceal hemorrhage (EVH) ( de Franch is, 2005; Ioannou, 2003), and has more recently become a 
standard of care for the treatment of subjects with HRS Type 1 where it is available 
(EASL,  2010 ). Terlipressin has been approved for the treatment of HRS Type 1 in Australia, 
[LOCATION_009], Ireland, South Korea, Mexico, Taiwan, Spain, India, Brazil, Turkey, and Portugal.  
3.3 Efficacy  
Improvement in renal function is the goal of therapy for HRS -AKI; improvement in renal 
function is associated with improvement in clinical outcomes and improved prognosis, with or 
without liver transplantation. HRS reversal is a widely accepted, clinically meaningful response 
to treatment for HRS Type 1, as apparent inexorable, rapid progression of renal failure is arrested 
and normal renal function in the setting of decompensated liver disease is restored. The primary 
endpoint of HRS reversal (1 serum creatinine [SCr] value of ≤  1.5 mg/dL) is the standard 
endpoint utilized in the literature and HRS treatment guidelines ( Arroyo , 1996; Salerno , 2007; 
Angeli , 2015).   Both terlipressin bolus and continuous infusion have been shown to be effecti ve

3.[ADDRESS_474404] -marketing data 
from the World He alth Organization (WHO) database. In general, terlipressin has a well -
established safety profile in the treatment of patients with HRS Type 1. The safety risks are 
predictable and recognizable. The adverse drug reactions can be readily managed and reversed  
by [CONTACT_378890][INVESTIGATOR_307] -care settings.   Contin uous infusion of 
terlipressin may be more tolerable than bolus injection  (Cavallin , 2016) .

arterioles and veins, leading to an increase in blood pressure (Cruz, 2000).   Midodrine is a 
prodrug; it is transformed into the active metabolite de -glymidodrine , a compound similar in 
structure to norepi[INVESTIGATOR_238] (Cruz, 2000). Midodrine was approved for use in the [LOCATION_002] 
for treatment of orthostatic hypotension in 1996. Octreotide is somatostain analogue that binds to 
somatostain receptors and mimics the ph ysiologic effects of somatostatin including inhibition of 
various hormones, some of which lead to vasodilation, thus octreotide can cause arteriolar 
vasoconstriction leading to increases in blood pressure ( Gold Standard ).  Octreotide can be 
administered vi a intravenous or subcutaneous routes and was approved for use in the United 
States in 1988 for treatment of certain neuroendocrine tumors. 
3.5.2 M&O Off-Label Use  
The combination of midodrine/octreotide (M&O), in conjunction with albumin, has been used 
“off-label ” in the [LOCATION_002] for treatment of HRS Type [ADDRESS_474406] demonstrated favorable outcomes for M&O in treatment of HRS Type 1 
(Angeli, 1999; Wong, 2004; Esrailian, 2007).  The use of M&O plus albumin is r ecommended in 
the 2012 AASLD guidelines for the treatment of HRS Type 1 ( Runyon, 2013) , particularly in 
light of the fact that terlipressin was not available in the [LOCATION_002] at the time of publication.  
However, the lar gest multi- centered study comparing terlipressin to M&O undertaken by [CONTACT_378891], was 
stopped early due to the considerable differences in H RS reversal between terlipressi n and M&O  
(55.5 vs 4.8%, p<0.001) ( Cavallin, 2015).

Increasing the duration of time in which a patient with decompensated cirrhosis experi ences 
renal dysfunction decreases the likelihood of renal recovery after liver transplant (Campbell, 
2005). Wong et al retrospectively evaluated patients that had experienced HRS Type 1 without 
reversal prior to liver transplant at University of Toronto be tween 2001 to 2010 (n=62); M&O 
was used as treatment of HRS Type 1 in the majority of these patients (Wong, 2015).  While 
none of the patients in the cohort had HRS reversal, 76% were free from dialysis 30 days after 
liver transplant and had a serum creati nine ≤ 1.5 mg/dL (Wong, 2015).  The duration of HRS

The active ingredient, N -[N-(N-glycylglycyl) glycyl] -8-L-lysinevasopressin, is a synthetically 
manufactured hormonogen of 8- lysine vasopressin, composed of 12 amino acids and having the 
characteristic ring structure of a cyclic nonapeptide with a disulfide bridge between the 4th and 
the 9th amino acid. Three glycyl -amino acids are substituted at position 1 (cysteine) of 
8-lysine -vasopressin. By [CONTACT_11384] N -terminal extension of 8 -lysine -vasopressin the metabolic 
degradatio n rate of the active ingredient is significantly reduced, because the glycyl molecules 
inhibit rapid N -terminal enzymatic degradation.  
 
8.1 Packaging and Labeling  
Single -use, sterile 6 -mL vials of a lyophilized solid containing 1 mg of terlipressin acetate 
(equivalent to 0.85 mg terlipressin free base) will be provided to the sites. Study drug labels will 
comply with local regulatory requirements, including sponsor name [CONTACT_3816], protocol 
number, storage conditions and US Investigational New Drug (IND) cauti on statement.  
8.2 Study  Drug Storage and Preparation  
Study drug should be stored in a secure location at 2ºC to 8ºC until reconstitut ed.  Reconstituted 
study drug bolus and study drug infusion bags may  be stored up to 48 hours at refrigerated 
storage conditions (2ºC to 8ºC)  and at room temperature (25  ºC) for 24 hours. ( Appendices  A and 
C). 
Terlipressin is stable at 2ºC to 8ºC  up to 48 hours in 0.9% sodium chloride solution at a 
concentration of 1mg Terlipressin in 5mL solution (Appendix A). 
Microbiology studies at a concentration of 2 mg Terlipressin in 50 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride 
solution are included in Appendix C .  Stability at a concentration of 0.034 mg/mL  has been 
previously demonstrated (Bui 2020). Study drug assignment, preparation, and dosing will be 
strictly limited to the investigators and their designees.  Study doses will be labelled to ensure 
drug is used only for authorized investigational use only.  The subject ’s initials will be placed on 
the label by [CONTACT_378893].  
8.3 Reconstitution  
Collaborative Research  Study , Version 4: 06/29/[ADDRESS_474417] dose of terlipressin, each vial will be reconstituted with 5 mL of sterile 0.9% sodium 
chloride solution and administered intravenously as a bolus injection and given over 1 minute at 
a dose of 0.5 mg.   
For cont inuous infusion, the dose of terlipressin is to be dissolved in 0.9% sodium chloride

Single -use, sterile 6 -mL vials containing 1 mg of lyophilize d terlipressin acetate (equivalent to 
0.85 mg terlipressin free base) with 10 mg mannitol as a bulking agent/stabilizer.  
• For initial bolus dose of 0.5mg, the vial will be reconstituted with 5 mL of sterile 0.9% 
sodium chloride solution and given over 1 -minute  push.  
• Continued dosing will be by 2mg infusion per day for Days 1, and 2.  For continuous 
infusion, the dose of terlipressin is to be dissolved in 0.9% sodium chloride solution and 
infused with a pump.   
• If on Day 3 the SCr is not 30% lower from the baseline value, increase infusion dose to 4 mg 
per day.  
• If on Day 5 the SCr is not 50% lower from the baseline value, increase infusion dose to 6- 8 
mg per day, per PI [INVESTIGATOR_9106]. Dosing can be increased by [CONTACT_324716] e than 1 mg increment at Day 5 
or beyond, up to a maximum of 8 mg/day.  
• If the subject has infusion stopped for ≥ 4 hours, a 0.5 mg bolus should be given prior to 
restarting infusion.  
• The drug should not be used in subjects with severe coronary artery dise ase or in the setting 
of circulatory overload, pulmonary edema, or bronchospasm as determined by [CONTACT_3786]. If drug therapy has been initiated, Investigator can also decide not to increase 
the dose, based on the patient ’s status with regard to the a bove, based on individual subject 
condition.

14.1 SAE Definitions  
The following definitions are based on:  
• International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) E2A: International Conference on 
Harmonisation Tripartite Guideline: Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and 
Standards for Expedited Reporting (1994).  
• ICH E6: International Conference on Harmonisation Tripartite Guideline: Guideline for 
Good Clinical Practice (1996) and Integrated Addendum [E6] (R2) June 2015.

Services Policy; “Reviewing and Reporting Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to 
Subjects or Others and Adverse Events" (2007).  
• Code of Feder al Regulations Title 21, Part 312.32 (2011).  
Also included are events that are common to this subject population. 
14.2 Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R)  
This is an unexpected S AE or suspected unexpected adverse reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) which is not  
listed in the Investigator ’s Brochure (IB), nor listed at the specificity or severity observed. If an 
S[LOCATION_003]R is listed in the IB as occurring with a specific class of drugs, or occurring as part of a 
disease process, or from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but not specifically 
mentioned as  occurring with the particular drug under investigation, it should be considered 
unexpected.  
14.3 Serious Adverse Event Definition  
Serious adverse events (SAE) are defined (in the view of the investigator or the sponsor) as any 
untoward medical occurrence that meets any of the following criteria:  
• Resulted in death. 
• Is life -threatening (if an AE or S[LOCATION_003]R places a subject at risk of death at the time of the 
event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it 
were more severe).  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]. 
• Results in disability (persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functi ons).  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
• Is an important medical event that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the subje ct and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of an 
important medical event include  allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, convulsions 
that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5186] n, or drug dependence/abuse.

University of Pennsylvania  Page 47 of 69 Confidential and Proprietary  14.4 Severity of an Adverse Event  
Intensity of an AE, assessed by [CONTACT_378899], moderate,  or severe, 
irrespective of the relationship to the drug or seriousness of the event, and evaluated according to 
the fol lowing scales:  
• Mild -  awareness of the symptom but easily tolerated.  
• Moderate -  discomfort enough to interfere with normal activities.  
• Severe -  Incapacitating with the inability to perform normal activities.  
14.5 Study Drug Causality  
Study drug causality will b e assessed as follows:  
Unrelated:  An AE that is clearly and incontrovertibly due to extraneous causes (disease, 
environment, etc. ) and does not meet the criteria for ‘ possible ’ or ‘ probable.’  
Possible:  The connection between the AE and study treatment appe ars unlikely but  cannot be 
ruled out with certainty. An AE may be considered ‘ possibly related ’ if it has at least 2 of the 
following:  
• It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of study drug.  
• It may readily have been produced by [CONTACT_423]'s clinical state or by [CONTACT_378900].  
• It follows a known response pattern to study drug.  
 
Probable:  An AE that is considered to be related to study drug treatment with a high degree of 
certainty. An AE may be considered probably related if:  
• It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of study drug.  
• It cannot be reasonably explained by  [CONTACT_20612]'s clinical 
state.  
• It follows a known pattern of response to study drug treatment.  
• It reappears upon rechallenge.

14.6 Overdose  
Overdose is defined as an accidental or intentional/infusion or excessive dose of a product.  
14.7 Collection of Adverse Events/Serious or Unexpected  
Any adverse event  occurring prior to signing the ICF and prior to 1st dose of study drug should 
be considered medical history or a pre -existing condition and will be collected on the Medical 
History CRF.  
Collaborative Research  Study , Version 4: 06/29/[ADDRESS_474436] results in a timely fashion. Laboratory 
abnormalities deemed clinically significant and serious should be reported to the sponsor as  
appropriate.  
14.9 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_378882]/or planned surgical operations for an illness or disease, which 
existed before the subject was randomized are not to be considered SAEs ( e.g., re-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_378883]). However, a baseline condition which deteriorates during the clinical 
study may be considered an SAE.  
Following the initial hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345], all re -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_52090] [ADDRESS_474437] end of 
treatment (e xcept for planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_378884]) are to be 
recorded as a SAE.  
14.[ADDRESS_474438] infection.  
Since HRS -  AKI is the indication under investigation, worsening or aggravation of HRS -  AKI 
during the active treatment period (including non -response) will NOT be recorded as a SAE 
unless HRS – AKI is the cause of death or results in a subsequent re -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_378885].  
14.[ADDRESS_474439] and/or subject ’s partner if the fetus was exposed to the 
study drug.  
14.12  Reporting Serious or Unexpected Adverse Reactions or Adverse Events  
Site Reporting to Sponsor  
Collaborative Research  Study , Version 4: 06/29/[ADDRESS_474440] report all SAEs to the sponsor (and applicable IRB) whether or not t he events 
are study drug -related or expected.  
All SAEs must be reported on a SAE form and faxed/scanned to International Heal thCare (IHC) 
within 24 hours  of an investigator becoming aware of the event:  
IHC Safety Review Officer  
Email: [EMAIL_7343]   
 
The initial SAE form does not need to be signed by [CONTACT_093]; however, a signed SAE 
form is required for final SAE reporting. The initial scan by [CONTACT_378901] 
(whenever possible) a detailed descriptio n of the event including start and stop dates, causality 
assessment by [CONTACT_093], and supported as needed with written copi[INVESTIGATOR_41984], 
autopsy reports, and other appropriate documents. Follow -up information (including information 
requested by [CONTACT_456]) should be reported by [CONTACT_6791]/scan within [ADDRESS_474441]/Independent Ethics Committee  
The investigator must notify the local IRB which approved the trial of the event in accordance 
with applicable guidelines.  
Sponsor Reporting to Regulatory Authorities and Investigators  
All reportable S AEs, including narrative safety reports of overall findings or data from aggregate 
analyses, will be reported to the applicable regulatory authorities by [CONTACT_378902]. 
The reporting of S AEs will be conducted in accordance with ICH E2A (Clinical Safety Data 
Management: Definitions and Standards for expedited reporting) and regulatory guidelines.  
In addition, study endpoints described in Section  5.1 of the protocol that are serious adverse 
events will only be reported in the final clinical study report unless the event was unusual,

University of Pennsylvania  Page 51 of 69 Confidential and Proprietary  unexpected, and there is evidence suggesting a causal rel ationship between the study drug and 
the event ( e.g., death from anaphylaxis).  
The sponsor will notify all participating Investigators of safety reports, in a blinded fashion, of 
potential serious risks as described in the safety review plan for this study .  
15 Statistical Plan  
Baseline characteristics, such as patient demographics, disease etiology, disease severity and 
factors present at time of listing for liver transplantation, will be compared between the 
terlipressin  treatment group and the retrospective control group.  Categorical variables will be 
presented as proportions and percentages and compared using chi -squared or Fisher ’s exact 
testing.  Continuous variables will be presented as means and standard deviations or medians and 
interquartile ranges.  Depending on the distribution of the variable, the Student ’s t-test or 
Wilcoxon rank sum will be used for comparison.   
15.1 Primary Analysis 
The primary analysis will utilize mixed effects regression modeling to estimate changes in serum 
creatinine ( SCr) over  the study period, accounting for baseline SCr and the correlation structure 
between the repeated measures.  All potential confounders will be added to the model and 
sequentially removed if they do not confound the association between receipt of terlipress in and 
improvement in Scr.  Those confounders resulting in a ≥ 10% change in the coefficient for the 
association between terlipressin  and improvement in SCr  will be retained in the final model. For 
all generated models, Aikaike Information Criteria (AIC) s cores will be calculated and 
compared. The model with the smallest absolute AIC value will be accepted as the most 
parsimonious and will be used as the primary model for the explanation of study results. As has 
been undertaken in other terlipressin studies  in HRS, a least -squares means analysis will be 
conducted using a repeated -measures analysis of variance.  The results from this approach to the 
statistical analysis can then be directly compared to prior study results.   
15.2 Secondary Analyses  
A number of sec ondary outcomes will be examined for the study cohort.  These outcomes 
include the incidence of dialysis, mortality, and liver transplantation at day 30 and 90.  The

University of Pennsylvania  Page 52 of 69 Confidential and Proprietary  incidence of kidney transplant within one year of liver transplant will also be determined.  
Additionally, descriptive comparisons of SCr  will be undertaken at day 30 and 90 of follow up 
and at 4 time points after receipt of liver transplantation (day 30, 90, 180 and 365)  and also at 
similar time points for those patients who were transplant in eligible or did not undergo a 
transplant .  Incidence will be calculated as the number of new events during the observation 
period divided by [CONTACT_378903].  All statistical analyses will be conducted using Stata 
version 15.1 statistical softwar e (StataCorp, College Park, TX).  Statistical significance will be 
declared for a two -sided hypothesis test if the  P value was <0.05.  
15.[ADDRESS_474442] 50 subjects in the intervention group and 150 
subjects, assembled from the study sites, in the control group.  Assuming a type 1 error of 0.05 
and power of 80%, we expect to be able to detect a range of differences in serum creatinine ( SCr) 
depending on the standard deviation of the change (primary endpoint) expected for the groups 
(see below).  Based on results from the REVERSE trial, a change in SCr  of as small as 0.05 mg/ 
dL would be able to be detected if the standard deviation for the change approximated 0.10 
mg/d L and a pre -specified sample size of 200 subjects, 50 of whom are in the intervention arm, 
is used for the calculation.

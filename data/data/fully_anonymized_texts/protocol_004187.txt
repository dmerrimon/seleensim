Page 11PROTOCOL SUMMARY
Indication:
Estrogen receptor-positive (ER(+)), HER2-negative (HER2(-)) Advanced Breast Cancer
(ABC).
Background and Rationale:
Breast cancer (BC) is the most common invasive cancer in women, with more than one 
million cases and over 411,[ADDRESS_4145] cancer, particularly for those with slowly progressive disease and limited tumor-related symptoms. Letrozole (Femara
®) is an oral nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor approved worldwide for the first-line 
treatment of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive advanced breast cancer (ABC).
PD-0332991 (palbociclib) is an oral cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitor that has 
been under investigation in Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials in multiple indications. PD-0332991 prevents cell cycle progression from G1 to S phase and has shown antitumor activity in multiple preclinical models, including in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) luminal breast cancer cell lines. 
Furthermore, pre-clinical exploration using a breast cancer cell line panel has demonstrated 
presence of retinoblastoma (Rb) protein and upregulation of cyclin D1 as well as decreased CDKN2A (p16) that were associated with sensitivity to PD-[ADDRESS_4146] cancer, led to the initiation of a randomized Phase 2 clinical trial (A5481003) investigating the antitumor activity of PD-[ADDRESS_4147]-line treatment of ER(+)/HER2(-) ABC patients.  The Phase 2 study was divided into 2 parts. In Part 1, patient selection was based only on ER/HER2 status while inPart 2, patients were additionally prospectively selected taking into account tumor CCND1 amplification and/or CDKN2A (p16) loss. 

PD-[ADDRESS_4148] that the combination of PD-0332991 with letrozole is superior to letrozole alone in the selected patient population as demonstrated by [CONTACT_4619]-free survival (PFS)(median 18.2 months vs 5.7 months, respectively), and improved objective response and disease control rates (52% vs 32% and 76% vs 47%, respectively) in patients treated with the combination.  Results from the Phase [ADDRESS_4149] commonly reported Grade 3 treatment-related adverse events were neutropenia (54%) and leucopenia (21%) in patients treated with the combination therapy. Grade 4 events included neutropenia and fatigue each reported for 6% of patients treated with PD-0332991 + letrozole.  No Grade 4 events were reported in the letrozole alone arm.Treatment-related Grade 1/2 AEs reported more frequently in patients in the 
PD-0332991 + letrozole arm compared with the letrozole alone arm included leukopenia, 
anemia, fatigue, alopecia, arthralgia, nausea, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia.  Hot flush was the most common Grade 1/2 treatment-related AE reported in patients enrolled in the letrozole alone arm.
Overall, 3 (9%) patients in the PD-0332991 + letrozole arm and 1 (3%) patient in the 
letrozole alone arm discontinued the Phase 2 Part 1 of Study A5481003 due to AEs including1 patient with Grade 4 fatigue (not related to PD-0332991) and 2 patients with Grade 3 neutropenia in the PD-0332991 + letrozole arm and 1 patient with Grade 2 nausea inthe letrozole alone arm. The median duration of treatment was 13.7 months in the PD-0332991 + letrozole arm vs 5.4 months in the letrozole alone arm, with PD-0332991 dosing interruptions and dose reductions due to AEs reported in 61% and 39% of patients enrolled in the PD-0332991 + letrozole arm respectively.  The median duration of dosing interruptions was 4.[ADDRESS_4150] dosing interruption was 55.5 days.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_4553], the median dose intensity for PD-0332991 was 87% across all cycles.
This randomized Phase 3 Study (A5481008) provides the opportunity to confirm the clinical 
benefit of the combination of PD-0332991 with letrozole observed in the randomized Phase 2 study. This study is designed to demonstrate that the combination of PD-0332991 with letrozole provides superior clinical benefit compared to letrozole in combination with placebo in postmenopausal women with ER(+)/HER2(-) ABC who have not received any prior systemic anti-cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_4554].
The present study met its primary objective of improving investigator-assessed PFS at the 
final analysis (data cutoff of 26 February 2016), demonstrating that in postmenopausal women with ER-positive/HER2-negative ABC who had not received any prior systemic anti-cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_3917]/metastatic disease, the addition of palbociclib to letrozole resulted in statistically significant, robust, and clinically meaningful 10-month improvement in median PFS (42% risk reduction) as compared with placebo plus letrozole (24.8 months vs 14.5 months, HR=0.576 [95% CI: 0.463, 0.718], 1 sided p<0.000001).

Page 13Prolongation of PFS in the palbociclib plus letrozole arm was also demonstrated in multiple 
sensitivity analyses and, importantly, was consistently observed in individual patient subgroups defined by [CONTACT_4620], supporting the robustness and internal consistency of PFS benefit findings within the study. The blinded independent central review (BICR) showed no investigator bias in favor of the palbociclib plus letrozole arm and the analysis results of BICR corroborated the results of investigator-assessed PFS.
Palbociclib plus letrozole was generally well tolerated with toxicities that were manageable 
by [CONTACT_4621] (including cycle delays) (335 [75.5%] patients), dose reduction (160 [36.0%] patients), and/or standard medical therapy.  The observed AEs were generally consistent with the known safety profile of palbociclib when administered with letrozole and when letrozole is administered as monotherapy; there were no unexpected major safety findings in this study population. The most common adverse events in the palbociclib plus letrozole group were neutropenia, leukopenia, fatigue, nausea, arthralgia, and alopecia. The majority of adverse events  were mild to moderate in severity with the exception of neutropenia and leukopenia.
76  Additionally, palbociclib, when added to 
letrozole, did not prolong QT interval to a clinically meaningful extent.77
Double-blinding of the present study will be maintained to allow ongoing collection of data for other pre-specified secondary endpoints including overall survival (OS) and patient reported outcomes.
Given the completion of the primary objective and most of the secondary objectives of the 
study, the management of patients who are still receiving active treatment is being modified. Upon Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) approval of Amendment 8 , clinical assessments will be reduced in scope and the required schedule of 
activities are provided in Appendix 10. 
Objectives:
Primary Objective:
•To demonstrate that the combination of PD-0332991 with letrozole is superior to 
placebo plus letrozole in prolonging progression-free survival (PFS) in 
postmenopausal women with ER(+)/HER2(-) advanced breast cancer who have not received any prior systemic anti-cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_4554]. 
Secondary Objectives:
•To compare measures of tumor control duration and overall survival between the treatment arms;
•To compare safety and tolerability between the treatment arms;  
•To compare health-related quality of life between the treatment arms;

Page 14•To characterize the effects of PD-0332991 at therapeutic doses in combination with 
letrozole on QT interval in this patient population;
•To determine trough PD-0332991 plasma concentration in this patient population and explore the correlations between exposure and response and/or safety findings;
•To characterize alterations in genes, proteins, and ribononucleic acids (RNAs)relevant to the cell cycle (eg, CCND1 amplification, CDKN2A deletion), drug targets 
(eg, CDK 4/6), and tumor sensitivity and/or resistance (eg, Ki67, pRb) in tumor tissues.
Study Design:
This is an international, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
parallel-group Phase 3 trial comparing the efficacy and safety of PD-0332991 in combination with letrozole versus placebo plus letrozole in postmenopausal women with ER(+)/HER2(-)ABC. Eligible patients will have histologically or cytologically proven diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the breast with evidence of locoregionally recurrent or metastatic disease and will be candidates to receive letrozole as first-line treatment for their advanced disease.In order to avoid inclusion of patients who are refractory or resistant to non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors, patients who received anastrozole or letrozole as a component of their (neo)adjuvant regimen may only enter the study if their disease did not progress while on or within 12 months from completion of their anastrozole/letrozole-containing (neo)adjuvant therapy. Patients will not have received any prior systemic anti-cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_4555]. Patients must have measurable disease as per the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor (RECIST) v.1.[ADDRESS_4151] 650 patients will be randomized 2:1 between the experimental arm (Arm A: at least 433 patients treated with PD-0332991 plus letrozole) and the control arm (Arm B: at least 217 patients treated with placebo plus letrozole).
Patients will be stratified by [CONTACT_4622] (visceral vs non-visceral), by [CONTACT_4623]-free interval 
since completion of prior (neo)adjuvant therapy (de novo metastatic; ≤12 months; 
>12 months) and by [CONTACT_4624] (neo)adjuvant anti-cancer treatment received (prior 
hormonal therapy; no prior hormonal therapy).
Patients randomized to Arm A (experimental arm) will receive
: 
•PD-0332991, 125 mg, orally once daily on Day 1 to Day 21 of every 28-day cycle 
followed by 7 days off treatment;
in combination with
•Letrozole, 2.5 mg, orally once daily (continuously).

Page 15Patients randomized to Arm B (control arm) will receive: 
•Placebo orally once daily on Day 1 to Day 21 of every 28-day cycle followed by 
7 days off treatment;
in combination with
•Letrozole, 2.5 mg, orally once daily (continuously). 
Patients will continue to receive their assigned treatment until objective disease progression, 
symptomatic deterioration, unacceptable toxicity, death, or withdrawal of consent, whichever occurs first.  However, patients may continue treatment as assigned at randomization beyond the time of disease progression at the discretion of the investigator if that is considered to be in the best interest of the patient and as long as no new anti-cancer treatment is initiated. In this case, the patient would continue with routine safety assessments as per the Schedule of 
Activities for the active treatment period.
The importance of timely and complete disease assessments in this study cannot be 
overstated.  Disease assessments will be performed every 12 weeks ( ±7 days) from the date 
of randomization.  Patients with bone lesions identified at baseline will also have repeat bone scans performed every 24 weeks ( ±7 days) from the date of randomization.  Each assessment 
will be performed as scheduled according to the calendar regardless of any dosing delay to 
prevent the introduction of bias into the assessment of efficacy. Failure to perform any of the required disease assessments will result in the inability to determine disease status for that time point.  Tumor assessments will be performed until radiographically and/or clinically (ie, for photographed or palpable lesions) documented PD as per RECIST v.1.1, study treatment discontinuation (for patients continuing treatment beyond RECIST-defined disease progression), initiation of new anti-cancer therapy or discontinuation of patient from overall study participation (eg, death, patient's request, lost to follow-up), whichever occurs first.  A series of incomplete disease assessments will result in censoring of the primary endpoint of PFS back to the time of the last full assessment that did not show disease progression.  Off schedule or incomplete disease assessments have the potential to weaken the conclusion of this clinical trial and must be avoided wherever possible.  Upon approval of Amendment 8, 
tumor assessments may be performed at a different schedule than the original protocol if this is common practice at that institution or it is recommended by [CONTACT_4625]’s clinical conditions. Selection of imaging studies will depend on treating physician and radiologist as per local institutional practice.  RECIST 1.1 may continue to be used to evaluate imaging assessments at the investigator’s discretion but will no longer be mandatory.  Assessments of tumor lesions [ie, target lesion(s), non-target lesion(s) and target lymph node(s)] will no longer be recorded in the case report form (CRF), nor will the RECIST assessments.  Only the date of progression of disease will be recorded.
Patients discontinuing the active treatment phase will enter a follow-up period during which
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy – Breast (FACT-B), survival and new anti-cancer therapy information (including regimen number, name [CONTACT_4741], start/stop dates, and dates of disease progression on subsequent anti-cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) will be collected every [ADDRESS_4152]’s/investigator’s tumor 
assessments as the primary data source. However, a blinded independent third-party core imaging laboratory will complete a retrospective review of radiographic images and clinical information collected on-study to verify the protocol-defined endpoints of disease response and progression determinations as assessed by [CONTACT_093].  Upon IRB/IEC approval of Amendment 8, retrospective blinded independent central review of radiographic images and clinical information will be discontinued.
An independent third party External Data Monitoring Committee (E-DMC) will monitor the 
safety data on a periodic basis.  The E-DMC will make recommendation as to whether the trial should continue based on ongoing review s of safety data. The E-DMC will also 
evaluate efficacy at the interim analyses and make a recommendation regarding study continuation based on observed results of the study.  The E-DMC membership and governance is outlined in a separate charter.

All primary and secondary endpoints based on radiological (and photographical where applicable) assessments of tumor burden (ie PFS, OR, DR, DC) will be derived using the local radiologist’s/investigator’s assessment. Tumor assessments will also be performed in retrospective by a blinded independent third-party core imaging laboratory and the data will be used for secondary supportive analyses. The study is designed to test the null hypothesis that the true PFS distributions for both PD-[ADDRESS_4153]-line treatment setting is 9 months and a risk reduction by 31% (hazard ratio of 0.69) or an improvement by 44% to a median PFS of 13 months in the PD-0332991 plus letrozole treatment arm is clinically meaningful.  A total of 347 events are required in the 2 arms of the study based on a 2:[ADDRESS_4154] 90% power to detect a difference assuming a true hazard ratio of 0.[ADDRESS_4155] at a significance level of 0.025.  Assuming a 15% drop-out rate on either treatment arm, a non-uniform accrual accomplished over a 15-month period and follow-up that will continue for about [ADDRESS_4156] patient is enrolled, a total sample size of approximately 650 patients (approximately 433 patients in the PD-0332991 plus letrozole arm and approximately 217 patients in the placebo plus letrozole arm) is required.
The sample size described above will also allow the assessment of differences in the 
secondary endpoint of overall survival (OS) with a high level of significance.  The OS outcome of a Phase 3 clinical trial in a similar patient population demonstrated a median OS of 34 months for the arm receiving letrozole.  Using this value as an assumption with a hypothesized 26% risk reduction (a hazard ratio of 0.74) or 35% improvement in median OS (from 34 months to 46 months) in patients randomized to receive PD-[ADDRESS_4157] is required for a significance level of 0.025 and power of 80% to detect a difference. OS will be hierarchically tested for significance at its interim analysis, provided the primary endpoint, PFS, is statistically significant at the interim PFS analysis, or at the final PFS analysis.

Page 18Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize all patient characteristics, treatment 
administration, investigational drug compliance, efficacy endpoints, safety parameters, and biomarkers.  Data will also be displayed graphically, where appropriate. 
The primary efficacy analyses will be based on the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, defined 
as all patients randomized to the study. Some efficacy analyses will also be performed on the 
as-treated (AT) population, defined as patients who receive at least 1 dose of study treatment (ie, PD-0332991/placebo or letrozole), with treatment assignments designated according to actual study treatment received. 
Time-to-event endpoints, including PFS, DR, and OS will be summarized using Kaplan-
Meier methods and displayed graphically.  The median event time and 2 sided 95% confidence interval for the median will be provided for each endpoint.  Stratified log rank tests will be used to compare PFS and OS between the treatment arms.
The 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year survival probabilities will be estimated using the Kaplan-
Meier method and a 2 sided 95% confidence interval for the log [-log(1-year, 2-year or 3-year survival probability)] will be calculated using a normal approximation using the Greenwood’s formula and then back transformed to give a confidence interval for the 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year survival probability itself.
The objective response rate (ORR) will be summarized by [CONTACT_4627] 2 sided 95% confidence interval calculated using a method based on the F distribution.  Response rate comparisons between the 2 treatment arms as randomized will be assessed using Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test with the same stratification factors as for the PFS analysis.
The study is designed to have one interim analysis and the final analysis based on the 
primary endpoint of PFS. A formal efficacy stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3106] (Haybittle-Peto) for rejecting the null hypothesis will be used for the interim analysis. The purposes for the interim analysis are to allow early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_4556], to assess safety of the combination regimen, and to potentially adjust the sample size. The interim analysis will be performed after approximately [ADDRESS_4158] documented progressive disease or die (approximately 65% of the total events expected).  If the value of the test statistic exceeds the 
Haybittle-Peto efficacy boundary (z ≥4.2059, p ≤ 0.000013), the trial may be stopped for 
efficacy. Under exponential distribution assumption, this boundary equates to a hazard ratio 
of ~0.55 or smaller in favor of the palbociclib plus letrozole arm versus the letrozole alone arm.. Alternatively, as appropriate, the sample size of the study may be adjusted using the 
method outlined by [CONTACT_4628].  If the results of the interim analysis indicate serious safety 
concerns, the sponsor will communicate with the Health Authorities regarding stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_4557].
An interim analysis for efficacy is also planned for the secondary endpoint of OS.  The 
analysis will be performed at the time of the interim or final PFS analyses if the primary endpoint PFS analysis is positive. The nominal significance levels for the interim and final analyses for OS will be determined by [CONTACT_4629]-DeMets procedure with an O’Brien-Fleming stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877].  The overall significance level for the efficacy analysis of OS will be preserved at 0.025 (one-sided test).

Page 19OS will be hierarchically tested for significance at the time of PFS analyses, provided the 
primary endpoint, PFS, is statistically positive at the interim or final PFS analyses.  If OS does not yield a significant result at these analyses, OS will be tested at the final OS analysis.  If PFS is not significant at the interim and/or final PFS analyses, OS will not be statistically evaluated. 
All patients treated with at least one dose of study treatment (ie, PD-0332991/placebo or 
letrozole) will be included in all safety analyses.  Summaries of AEs and other safety parameters will be provided as appropriate.  Frequencies of patients experiencing at least one AE will be displayed by [CONTACT_4630].  Detailed information collected for each AE will include a description of the event, duration, whether the AE was serious, severity, relationship to study drug, action taken, and clinical outcome.  Severity of the AEs will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE version 4.0.  Summary tables of clinical laboratory results will be prepared to examine the worst toxicity grade on study and distribution of laboratory measures over time.  Shift tables will be provided to examine the distribution of laboratory abnormalities.
Breast cancer-specific quality of life mean scores at each assessment time point and change 
from baseline scores will be compared between the treatment arms at various time points using a mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) approach adjusting for specified covariates. In addition, analyses will be performed to determine if the change from baseline scores achieve the appropriate minimally important difference (MID) cut-off for the scale being examined. Patients from the ITT population who completed a baseline assessment and at least one post-baseline assessment prior to study treatment discontinuation will be considered evaluable for the patient-reported outcome (PRO) analysis.  In addition to the above analyses, an examination of the time to deterioration (TTD) also will be carried out using survival analysis methods. A composite definition for deterioration based on death, tumor progression, and MID will be used.

Special Laboratory Studies 
PharmacokineticsmX
a.Active Treatment Phase: All assessments should be performed prior to dosing with study medications on the visit day unless otherwise indicated.  
Acceptable time windows for performing each assessment are described in the column headers. For the purposes of this trial 1 cycle is 28 days. A cycle 
could be longer than 28 days if persistent toxicity delays the initiation of the subsequent cycle.
b.Cycle 1/Day 1: Blood chemistry, hematology, 12-lead ECG and physical examination not required if acceptable screening assessment is performed within 
7 days prior to randomization.
c.End of Treatment/Withdrawal: End of Treatment/Withdrawal evaluations will be performed as soon as possible but no later than 4 weeks (ie, 28 days) 
±7days from last dose of study treatment and prior to the initiation of any new anti-cancer therapy. Obtain these assessments if not completed during the 
previous 4 weeks on study (or within the previous 8 weeks for disease assessments).   

PD-[ADDRESS_4159] Treatment Follow-up: After discontinuation of study treatment, post-treatment follow-up information (ie, survival statu s, and post-study anti-cancer
therapy details [including regimen number, name [CONTACT_4741], start/stop dates, and dates of disease progression on subsequent anti-ca ncer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]]) will be 
collected every 6 months (±7 days) from the last dose of study treatment.  Telephone contact [CONTACT_4631].
e.Informed Consent: Informed consent may be obtained greater than 28 days from randomization; however, must be obtained prior to any protocol requi red 
assessments being performed (with the exception of certain imaging assessments if meeting the criteria defined in Section 6.1 ).
f.Medical/Oncological History: To include information on prior anti-cancer treatments.
g.Baseline Signs/Symptoms: Baseline tumor related signs and symptoms will be recorded at the Cycle 1 Day 1 visit prior to initiating treatment and then 
reported as adverse events during the trial if they worsen in severity or increase in frequency.
h.Retained Pharmacogenomic Blood Sample: A single 4 mL blood sample (Prep D1; K2 EDTA whole blood collection optimized for DNA analysis) will be 
collected pre-dose at the Cycle [ADDRESS_4160] pharmacokinetic s or drug response include, 
but may not be limited to, genes encoding drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters, and genes thought to be related to the me chanism of drug action.
i.Mandatory Tumor Tissue For Confirmatory Testing and for Biomarker Assessments: Tumor tissue is required for patient participation.  Submission of 
formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumor samples (blocks) of adequate size to allow for three 0.[ADDRESS_4161] be provided whenever 
possible. If such tissue sample is unavailable, a de novo fresh biopsy is recommended when, in the investigator’s judgment, such biopsy is feasible and can 
be safely performed.  A sample of the original diagnostic tissue (ie, archival) will also be collected when available and sent to the sponsor-designated central 
laboratories for assessment of biomarkers associated with sensitivity and/or resistance to PD-0332991 (eg, Ki67, CDKN2A (p16), p Rb).  Retrospective 
confirmation of ER status and prospective confirmation of HER2 status when required to be repeated for eligibility purpose will  be performed using the most 
recent tumor sample.  Original diagnostic tumor tissue will be used for confirmation of ER and HER2 status in the event that a recurrent/metastatic tissue 
sample is not available and a fresh biopsy of the recurrent/metastatic lesion is not feasible.  An optional fresh tumor biopsy will be collected at the end of 
treatment visit, only for patients who discontinue treatment due to disease progression.  The tumor tissue will be used to determ ine possible mechanisms of 
resistance.  Tissue samples from all patients will be used for additional biomarker analyses.  Details on preparation of these samples including processing, 
storage, and shipment will be provided in the Study Manual.  
j.Physical Examination/Vital signs: A full physical examination including an examination of all major body systems (including general appearance, head, 
ears, eyes, nose, mouth, throat, neck, thyroid, lungs, heart, breasts, abdomen, and musculoskeletal), height (at screening only ), weight, blood pressure and 
pulse rate, which may be performed by a physician, registered nurse or other qualified health care provider, will be required at  screening and, Day 1 of 
Cycles 1 and 2.  Symptom-directed physical examinations, blood pressure and pulse rate will be performed at subsequent visits.
k.Ophthalmic Examinations: Once Amendment #3 is IRB approved, all newly enrolled patients will undergo an ophthalmic examination at baseline, and on 
study treatment after 3 months (Cycle 4 Day 1), 6 months (Cycle 7 Day 1), 12 months (Cycle 13 Day 1), every 12 months (Day 1 of Cy cles 25, 37 etc…)
thereafter, and at the End of Treatment visit. Additional opht halmic examinations may be performed during the study as clinically indi cated (including for 
patients randomized prior to Amendment 3 approval). The ophthalmic examinations will include: best corrected distant visual acuity (S nellen), refractive 
error associated with best corrected distant visual acuity, intra ocular pressure (IOP – one reading), slit lamp biomicroscopy of t he anterior segment including 
cell count and flare grading, crystalline lens grading using the Wisconsin Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) [ADDRESS_4162]. Refer to Section 7.2.3 . Ocular Safety Assessments for 
further details on these procedures.

AST/ALT, alkaline phosphatase, sodium, potassium, magnesium, total calcium, total bilirubin, BUN (or urea), serum creatinine, an d albumin.  Additional 
hematology/chemistries panels may be performed as clinically indicated. Additionally, hemoglobin A1c will be measured during the active treatment phase 
in all patients every 3 months from the date of randomization (ie, C4D1, C7D1, C10D1, etc), and at the end of treatment visit.
m.12-Lead ECG/Pharmacokinetics: Refer to Pharmacokinetic and ECGs Schedule of Activities table  for details and timing of procedures.
n.12-Lead ECG: To be performed on Day 1 of Cycles 4, 7, and 10.  ECGs beyond Cycle 10 will be performed as clinically indicated.  Refer to 
Pharmacokinetic and ECGs Schedule of Activities table for further details and timing of procedures.
o.Disease Assessments: Please refer to the tumor assessment requirement flowchart for details and timing of procedures.
p. CT/MRI Scans of Chest, Abdomen, Pelvis, any clinically indicated sites of disease, and of bone lesions; clinical evaluation o f superficial disease: Please 
refer to the tumor assessment requirement flowchart for details and timing of procedures.
q.Radionuclide Bone Scan, Whole Body: Please refer to the tumor assessment requirement flowchart for details and timing of procedures.
r.Drug Compliance: PD-0332991, placebo and letrozole bottle(s)/blisters including any unused capsules/tablets will be returned to the clinic for d rug 
accountability.  Drug accountability will be performed on Day 1 of every cycle prior to dispensing drug supply for the next cyc le.
s.Adverse Events: For SAEs, the active reporting period begins from the time that the patient provides informed consent through and including [ADDRESS_4163].  Following the active safety reporting period, other SAEs of  which the investigator becomes 
aware should be reported to [COMPANY_007], unless the SAE is attributed by [CONTACT_4632]-cancer therapy or to the patient’s participation in a subsequent clinical study.  AEs (serious and non serious) should be recorded on the CRF from the 
time the patient has taken at least one dose of study treatment through last patient visit.
t.Concomitant Medications/Treatments: Concomitant medications and treatments will be recorded from [ADDRESS_4164]-B Assessments: Patients will complete questionnaires prior to any study or medical procedure on Day 1 of Cycles 1, 2 and 3 and then 
Day 1 of every other cycle thereafter starting with Cycle 5 (ie, Cycle 5, 7, 9, etc), and at the end of treatment visit.  All sel f-assessment questionnaires must 
be completed by [CONTACT_4633].  Interviewer administration in clinic may be used un der special circumstances.
v.Cycle X, Day 1: In the event that the start of a new cycle is delayed due to treatment related toxicity, procedures required on Day 1 of the gi ven cycle will be 
performed when PD-0332991/placebo is resumed.  New cycle Day 1 procedures (ie, physical examination, ECOG performance status, E CG, Quality of Life 
questionnaires, blood chemistry, hematology) that were performed prior to knowing the need to delay the start of the cycle do no t need to be repeated (1) if 
not required to determine whether study drug may be resumed and (2) if performed within 7 days prior to study drug resumption.
w.Letrozole (both treatment arms): To be taken orally, daily, and continuously.
x.PD-0332991 or Placebo: To be taken orally, daily from Day 1 to Day 21 (21 days) of every 28-day cycle followed by 7 days off treatment. In the event th e 
Day 1 clinic visit of the subsequent cycle is scheduled during the -2 day allowable visit time window (ie. Day 27, Day 28), patie nts must be instructed to 
complete their 7-day off treatment period of the current cycle prior to resuming blinded therapy even if criteria for treatment  resumptions are met at the visit. 
Cycle off treatment periods of less than [ADDRESS_4165]-B Assessments: After patients discontinue from the active treatment phase, FACT-B questionnaire will continue to be collected during the follow- up 
period every 6 months ( ±7 days) from the last dose of investigational product until patient permanent discontinuation from study or end of follow-up pe riod 
whichever occurs first. During the follow-up period, all self-assessment questionnaires should preferably be completed by [CONTACT_4634] a scheduled 
clinic visit. However, if no clinic visits are being scheduled during the follow-up period interviewer administration via phone  call may be used instead and 
documented accordingly in the patient source notes.

°ECG1 = First triplicate ECGs performed for patient in Group 1.
a.12-lead ECG: A 12-lead (with a 10-second rhythm strip) tracing will be us ed for all ECGs. ECGs will be performed in triplicate approximately  [ADDRESS_4167] intervals automatically.  ECG 
interval readings by [CONTACT_4635]’s algorithm will be read and interpreted at the investigational site for eligibility dete rmination and patient safety 
monitoring and documentation stored in the source documents.  Blinded manual interval measurements at a core ECG laboratory wil l be used for primary 
statistical analysis of ECG data in group 1 patients (as described below).  ECG measurements will include PR interval, QT inter val, RR interval and QRS 
complex.  Additional ECGs may be performed as clinically indicated. 
Triplicate ECGs (also referred as ECG E) will be performed during the screening period for all patients to determine the mean QTc interval for eligibility 
purpose. 
Patients found to be eligible will be part of one of the two groups highlighted below depending on which site screened the pati ent.  ECG frequency for each 
group is described below:  
Group 1 (approximately 60 patients) at selected sites: 
•On the day preceding treatment initiation (day 0), triplicate ECGs will be obtained at time 0 (first ECG also referred to as EC G1), and then 2, 4, 6, and 
8 hours after ECG1. 
•At Cycle 1 Day 14, triplicate ECGs will be obtained at 0 hour (pre-dose) and then, 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours following PD-0332991/placebo dosing. Timing 
of ECGs performed on Day [ADDRESS_4168] be time-matched (clock time ±35 minutes) with ECG assessments performed on Day 0 (eg, if ECG1 on Day 0 
was performed at 10:[ADDRESS_4169] be performed within the 9:30AM-10:30AM timeframe but a s close as 
possible to 10:00AM whenever feasible).  On day [ADDRESS_4170] 1 hour .  ECGs should be performed immediately before PK blood draws at respective time points.  
Patients who cannot complete ECG measurements on Day 0 and/or PK-matched ECG measurements (both ECG and PK collected) on Day 14 will need to be 
replaced. 
•Additionally, triplicate ECGs will be obtained for safety monitoring at 0 hour (pre-dose) on Day 1 of Cycle 1*, Day 14 of Cycle  2, then on Day 1 of 
Cycles 4, 7, and 10.  ECGs beyond Cycle 10 will be performed as clinically indicated. 
Group 2 (all other patients): 
•Triplicate ECGs will be obtained for safety monitoring at 0 hour (pre-dose) on Day 1 of Cycle 1*, Day 14 of Cycles 1 and Cycle 2, then on Day 1 of 
Cycles 4, 7, and 10.  ECGs beyond Cycle 10 will be performed as clinically indicated. 
*NOTE: Triplicate ECGs do not need to be repeated on Day 1 of Cycle 1 if ECG E was performed within 7 days of the date of randomization. 
Alltriplicate ECG tracings will be sent electronically to a core ECG laboratory for blinded manual interval measurements.
If at any time the mean QTc is prolonged ( ≥[ADDRESS_4171] two separate ECGs, ie, CTCAE ≥ Grade 3), then the ECGs should be re-evaluated by a 
qualified person at the site for confirmation as soon as the finding is made, including verification that the machine reading is  accurate.  If manual reading 
confirms a QTc of ≥501 msec, immediate search for reversible causes (including electrolyte abnormalities, hypoxia and concomitant medications for drugs 
with the potential to prolong the QTc interval) should be performed.  In addition, repeat ECGs should be immediately performed hourly for at least 3 hours 
until the QTc interval falls below 501 msec. 
•If QTc interval reverts to less than 501 msec, and in the judgment of investigator(s) in consultation with the sponsor the caus e is determined to be due to 
cause(s) other than study drug, treatment may be continued with regular ECG monitoring under hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4558]. 
•If in that timeframe the QTc intervals remain above 501 msec the study drug will be held until the QTc interval decreases to <5 01 msec. 
Prior to concluding that an epi[INVESTIGATOR_4559], thorough consideration should be given to potential precipi[INVESTIGATOR_4560] (eg, change in patient clinical condition, effect of concurrent medication, electrolyte disturbance) and possible evalua tion by [CONTACT_4636].  If 
investigational product causality cannot be ruled out, Investigational product dose adjustment and/or discontinuation should be  performed according to 
Section 5.3.4 : Recommended Dose Modification. Additional triplicate ECGs may be performed as clinically indicated.
b.Pharmacokinetics (collected right after ECG assessment): For patients in the ECG Group 1, plasma PK samples for PD-0332991 (including its active 
metabolites, if appropriate) determination will be obtained at the times indicated for ECGs. One additional plasma PK sample wi ll be collected pre-dose on 
Day 14 of Cycle 2. 
For all other patients (ECG Group 2), plasma PK samples for PD-0332991 (including its active metabolites, if appropriate) deter mination will be collected 
prior to dosing (pre-dose) on Day 14 of Cycle 1 and Cycle 2. Additional
blood samples may be requested from patients experiencing unexpected or serious adverse events, or adverse events that lead to discontinuation.

to treatment delay is not permitted .  The same tumor assessment technique MUST be used throughout the study for a given lesion/patient. 
c. Patients who have already demonstrated objective disease progression as per RECIST v.1.[ADDRESS_4173] documented objective disease progression at time of study treatment discontinuation, 
tumor assessment will continue to be performed every 12 weeks ( ±7 days) and bone scans (as applicable) every 24 weeks ( ±7 days) until radiographically 
and/or clinically confirmed objective disease progression, initiation of new anti-cancer therapy, or discontinuation of patient from overall study participation 
(eg, death, patient's request, lost to follow-up). 
d. The CT scans, including brain CT scan if applicable, should be performed with contrast agents unless contraindicated for medic al reasons. If IV contrast is 
medically contraindicated, the imaging modality to be used to follow the disease (either CT without contrast or MRI) should be the modality which best 
evaluates the disease, and the choice should be determined by [CONTACT_4637].  MRI of the abdomen and pelvis can 
be substituted for CT if MRI adequately depi[INVESTIGATOR_4561].  However, MRI of the chest should not be substituted for CT of che st even if IV contrast is 
contraindicated.  In such case CT will be performed without contrast.  If MRI is used to follow-up bone lesion(s) it must be pe rformed a few days before any 
treatment that may affect bone-marrow cellularity (eg, G-CSF).

g. Bone scans will be carried out at baseline for all patients within [ADDRESS_4174] bony sites of disease. Bone scans 
performed before the signing of informed consent as routine procedures (but within 12 weeks before randomization) do not need to be repeated and may be 
used as baseline assessments as long as (1) tests were perfor med using the method requirements outlined in RECIST v.1.1 (2) the s ame technique/modality 
can be used to follow identified lesions throughout the trial for a given patient (3) appropriate documentation indicating that  these radiographic tumor 
assessments were performed as standard of care is available in the patient’s source notes.
h. Any suspi[INVESTIGATOR_4562] (ie, hotspots) identified on the bone scans at baseline and on subsequent bone scans MUST be confirmed by X-ray, CT scan 
with bone windows or MRI.  The same modality must be used throughout the trial for confirmation for a given lesion/patient.  Bon e lesions identified at 
baseline will be followed up according to the same assessment schedule (ie, every 12 weeks ±7 days from randomization) as for all other lesions.  Areas that 
have received palliative radiotherapy cannot be used to assess response to study treatment.
i. If bone lesions were identified at baseline bone scans will be repeated during the active treatment phase every 24 week ( ±7 days) from the date of 
randomization and at the time of confirmation of CR.  If no bone lesions were identified at baseline, bone scans will only be r epeated during the active 
treatment phase when clinically indicated (ie, patient describes new or worsening bone pain, or has increasing alkaline phosphata se level, or other signs and 
symptoms of new/progressing bone metastases) but are required at the time of confirmation of CR. New Abnormalities found on subse quent bone scans 
must also be confirmed by X-ray, CT scan with bone windows or MRI. 
j. Clinical assessment of superficial disease must be carried out on the same date as the imaging studies and will include photographs of all superficial 
metastatic lesions. All lesion measurements must be recorded in the case report form (CRF).
Notes: 
- Radiographic tumor assessments may be done at any time if there is clinical suspi[INVESTIGATOR_4563].  If progressive 
disease is confirmed per RECIST v.1.1, patients are expected to discontinue study therapy and begin the follow-up phase of the trial. However, patients may 
continue treatment as assigned at randomization beyond the time of RECIST-defined PD at the discretion of the investigator if t hat is considered to be in the best 
interest of the patient and as long as no new anti-cancer treatment is initiated.

million cases and over 411,[ADDRESS_4184] cancer, particularly for those with slowly progressive disease and limited tumor-related symptoms. Letrozole 
(Femara
®) is an oral nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor and it is approved worldwide for the 
first-line treatment of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive advanced 
breast cancer (ABC).
1.1. Indication
Estrogen receptor-positive (ER(+)), HER2 negative (HER2(-)) Advanced Breast Cancer 
(ABC)
1.2. Background and Rationale
1.2.1. Role of Letrozole in the Treatment of Estrogen Receptor Positive Breast Cancer
Approximately two-thirds of breast cancers express estrogen receptor (ER)3and a role for 
estrogens in breast cancer etiology and progression is well established. Modification of 
estrogen activity or synthesis represents the treatment of choice for postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive ABC, particularly for those with slowly progressive disease and limited tumor-related symptoms.
2
Conversion of androgens to estrogens via aromatase enzyme action represents the main 
source of estrogens in postmenopausal women.  Letrozole (Femara®) is an oral nonsteroidal 
aromatase inhibitor that is approved worldwide for the first-line treatment of postmenopausal 
women with hormone receptor-positive ABC.  In a multicenter Phase [ADDRESS_4185] of the patients (91%) had received no prior treatment for their advanced disease. Letrozole was superior to tamoxifen for time to tumor progression (median, 9.4 vs 6.0 months, P<0 .0001), time to treatment failure (median, 9 vs 5.7 months, P<0.0001), overall objective response rate (32% vs 21%, P= 0.0002), and overall clinical benefit (50% vs 38%, P=0 .0004). Median overall survival (OS) was slightly prolonged for the letrozole arm (34 vs 30 months);however, approximately 50% of the patients in the tamoxifen arm crossed over to letrozole at disease progression.
Letrozole is administered orally on a continuous 2.[ADDRESS_4186] 
on sensitive populations of cells in early to mid-G1 phase.  G1/S transition is under the 
control of CDKs activated by [CONTACT_4638].  CDK4 and CDK6 are activated by [CONTACT_4639] D-type cyclins and act early in G1 phase.
7-10A 
primary target of CDK action in G1 phase is the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene product (pRb), which mediates G1 arrest through sequestration of transcriptional factors of the E2F-DP family. Phosphorylation of pRb and other members of the pocket protein family (p107 and p130) by [CONTACT_4640]-CDK complexes leads to release of E2F and DP transcription factors and transcription of requisite genes for S-phase entry.
[ADDRESS_4187] cancer cells treated with estrogen 
exhibit increased expression of cyclin D1 mRNA and protein, formation of active cyclin D1-CDK4 complexes, and phosphorylation of pRb leading to G1 /S transition.
20-[ADDRESS_4188] associated with inhibited CDK activity.40,41Cell cycle progression induced 
by [CONTACT_4641]-G1, well beyond the point of cyclin D1-CDK4 activation.
21Functional association of cyclin D1-CDK4 is required for 
estrogen-induced CDK2 activation and G1/S transition and estrogen regulates expression of p21
Cip1, p27Kip1, and Cdc25A independent of D-type cyclin-CDK4 function.[ADDRESS_4189] cancer.  
Approximately 15%–20% of human breast cancers exhibit amplification of the cyclin D1 (CCND1) gene,
43-45while the majority of human mammary carcinomas over
express cyclin D1 protein.46-48Over expression of cyclin D1 is seen early in breast cancer, 
and it is maintained at all stages of breast cancer progression, including metastatic lesions.
46,49Amplification of the CDK4 gene, located at 12q13-q14, has been shown as an 
alternative genetic alteration to CDKN2A inactivation in various human tumor including breast cancer.
50,51There is a mounting body of evidence linking a specific 
CCND1 polymorphism (G/A870) to increased risk of cancer and outcome in a variety of tumor types including breast cancer.  This polymorphism results in a splice variant, altered protein structure and enhanced oncogenic activity in experimental models.
[ADDRESS_4190] revealed loss of pRb expression in 
20–35% of tumors, and loss of heterozygosity or other alterations of the Rb locus in 7-37% of tumors.
54-57In preclinical models, Rb depletion appears to be associated with 
resistance to antiestrogen therapy.58Finally, virtually all ER-positive cell lines harbor loss of 
p16INK4a 59,60expression, and low expression of CDK inhibitors p21 and p27 and high 
expression level of cyclin E and D1 have all been associated with resistance to anti-estrogen therapy.
1.2.4. ER and HER2 Status in Breast Cancer
The ER and HER2 status of breast metastatic disease are usually assumed to be the same as 
that of the primary tumor. However, mounting evidences from both prospective and retrospective studies have shown a discordant rate of approximately 25% in either ER or HER2 status between primary breast tumor and its metastatic lesions.
61,62The change can be 
from ER- positive primary tumor to ER-negative metastatic disease or vice versa. Theanalytical variables of immunohistochemistry (IHC) testing such as antigen retrieval and subjectivity in observer analysis also contribute to the observed discordance.
63Another 
dilemma in ER testing accuracy has been primary institutional site testing versus high volume central laboratory testing. It has been stated in the recently published American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)/College of American Pathologists (CAP) guidelines for ER testing that the concordance rate between local and central laboratory testing for ER is about 80 to 90%.
64This variation may be due to the lack of rigorous assay optimization 
and/or reproducibility of IHC testing procedures at some of local testing laboratoriesincluding methods of antigen retrieval and subjectivity in observer analysis. This highlightsthe importance of confirmative testing of ER status using Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared and/or approved kits and platform at a central CLIA/CAP certified laboratory to minimize, if not eliminate, these differences/variables for patients participating in clinicaltrials.

Page 371.2.5. Overview of PD-0332991
PD-0332991 (Molecular Weight: 573.67) is an orally active potent and highly selective 
reversible inhibitor of CDK4 and CDK6.  The compound prevents cellular deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis by [CONTACT_4642] G1 into the S phase.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Preclinical Data
Treatment of cultured tumor cells with PD-[ADDRESS_4191] cancer cell lines.  
Results from these experiments indicate that those cell lines that are more sensitive to PD-0332991 (IC
50<150 nM) have low levels of CDKN2A (p16) and high levels of 
Rb1, while resistant cell lines show the opposite characteristics. Sensitive cell lines in this panel represent mostly the luminal ER+ subtype.
65The combination of PD-0332991 and 
aromatase inhibitors has not been tested in preclinical models. However, the combination of PD-0332991 with tamoxifen has recently been tested in vitro in ER+ human breast cancer cell lines indicating a synergistic interaction
65and provides a biologic rationale for evaluating 
the combination of PD-0332991 with anti-hormonal therapy in the clinic.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Human Pharmacokinetic (PK) Data
To date, pharmacokinetic data have been collected in 4 clinical studies in cancer patients
(A5481001, A5481002, A5481003 and A5481004).  Pharmacokinetic parameters are available from all 74 patients enrolled in Study A5481001 following a single dose (Day 1 of Cycle 1), and from 51 patients following multiple-dose administration (Day 8 of Cycle 1) atdaily doses ranging from 25 to 225 mg of PD-0332991.  In addition, PK parameters are also available for nine patients on Day 14 of Cycle 1 (from patients on Schedule 2/1, ie, 2 weekson treatment followed by 1 week off treatment) and 4 patients on Day 21 of Cycle 1 (from patients on Schedule 3/1, ie, 3 weeks on treatment followed by 1 week off treatment).  The exposure (AUC
(0-10) and C max) increased in a dose proportional manner over the dose range of 
25 to 225 mg once daily  (QD) following PD-0332991 administration on Days 1 and 8 of 
Cycle 1, although some variability (low to moderate) around these doses was observed particularly at the 150 mg QD dose level.  Following repeated daily dosing to Day 14 and Day 21 (assumed to be steady state), PD-0332991 was absorbed with a median T
maxof 
~4 hours.  The mean PD-0332991 Vz/F was 3103 L, which is significantly greater than total body water (42 L), indicating that PD-0332991 extensively penetrates into peripheral tissues.  PD-0332991 was eliminated slowly; the mean t
½was 26.5 hours (ranged 15.8 to 36.2 hours) 
and the mean CL/F was 86.1 L/hour.  PD-0332991 accumulated following repeated dosing with a median R
acof 2.4, which is consistent with a half life of ~[ADDRESS_4192] study, A5481021, a Phase 1, 
open-label 4 sequence 4 period crossover study of palbociclib (PD-0332991) in healthy 
volunteers to estimate the effect of food on the bioavailability of palbociclib , suggest that the 
administration of palbociclib with food results in more consistent drug absorption and exposure than administration of palbociclib in a fasted state. As a result of these findings,patients should be instructed to take palbociclib with food.  
Preliminary results from the recently performed antacid effect study, A5481018, a Phase 1, 
open-label fixed-sequence 2-period crossover study of palbociclib in healthy subjects to 
investigate the potential effect of antacid treatment on the pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose administered under fasted conditions , suggest that the administration of proton-pump 
inhibitors concomitantly with palbociclib treatment leads to a significant decrease in palbociclib exposure. Since proton-pump inhibitors affect the pH of the upper GI tract for an extended period the concomitant use of proton-pump inhibitors with PD-[ADDRESS_4193] of famotidine (an
histamine H
2-receptor antagonist) given 10 hours before and 2 hours after palbociclib; 
rabeprazole sodium (a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI)) given daily for 6 days before and 4 hours prior to palbociclib; mi-acid maximum strength liquid given 2 hours before palbociclib; mi-acid maximum strength liquid given [ADDRESS_4194] capsule formulation dose given under fed conditions in healthy volunteers. The results from this study showed that famotidine given 10 hours before and 2 hours after palbociclib or mi-acid maximum strength liquid (local antacid) given [ADDRESS_4195] the exposure of palbociclib. Additionally, the results showed that coadministration of rabeprazole and palbociclib under fed conditions resulted in a decrease in palbociclib exposure less dramatic than the change in exposure observed in study A5481018 where palbociclib was administered under fasted conditions. Palbociclib change in geometric mean C
maxin combination with daily administration of rabeprazole decreased by 41% under fed 
conditions compared to the 80% decrease under fasted conditions. The change in AUC infof 
palbociclib when coadministered with rabeprazole under the fed conditions was approximately 13% compared to palbociclib given alone. Based upon this data, under fed conditions, the use of H
2-receptor antagonists or local antacids or PPIs is now permitted as 
defined in Section 5.5.3. 
Pharmacokinetic data from Study A5481002 indicate that PD-0332991 exposure at steady state in mantle cell lymphoma patients, is similar to that observed in solid tumors (Protocol A5481001).
Pharmacokinetic analysis of preliminary data from the Phase 1 portion of 
Study A5481003 (breast cancer, combination with letrozole) was conducted to evaluate the potential for drug-drug interaction between PD-0332991 and letrozole.  The results indicate lack of a potential for drug-drug interaction between PD-0332991 and letrozole when administered in combination.

Page 39PD-0332991 is metabolized to multiple metabolites in a qualitatively similar manner in rat, 
dog and human liver microsomes.  In vitro, PD-0332991 is primarily metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A4 enzymes. An exploratory evaluation of the circulating metabolites for PD-0332991 was conducted in plasma samples obtained from patients treated with PD-0332991 200 mg QD (Schedule 2/1) in Study A5481001.  Preliminary assessment of the pooled plasma samples on Day 14 of Cycle 1 indicated that the glucuronide conjugate of PD-0332991 and the lactam of PD-0332991 (PF-05089326) were the main metabolites present in plasma.  Other metabolites observed were the glucuronide conjugates of hydroxylated PD-0332991 and the glucuronide conjugate of reduced PD-0332991.  PF-05089326 was also observed in the circulation of rats following repeated daily oral administration of PD-0332991 at the dose levels of 50 and 100 mg/kg/day.  Plasma protein binding of PD-0332991 and PF-05089326 is ~85% and 95%, respectively.
[IP_ADDRESS]. QTc Evaluation Data
In vitro (hERG) and in vivo (dog telemetry) studies revealed a potential for QT prolongation 
at unbound concentrations ≥14-fold the unbound steady-state C
maxassociated with the 
clinical dose of 125 mg QD (refer to the PD-0332991 investigator's brochure for additional 
details).
A preliminary pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis has been conducted to explore 
the QT/QTc and plasma PD-032991 concentration relationship for Study A5481001 (FIH study) by [CONTACT_4643] (NONMEM).  Data from 73 patients were used for the analysis, and an analysis of the QTcF and QTcB data demonstrated that QTcF was the more appropriate correction method based on plots of the 
QTc versus RR interval. No patient had a maximum on treatment QTcF value of ≥500 msec.  
The QTcF changes from the baseline at the mean C
maxcalculated for 200 mg dose were 
simulated for [ZIP_CODE] patients.  The mean and upper 95% confidence interval of QTcF change 
from the baseline were 5.[ADDRESS_4196] of PD-0332991 on QTc 
prolongation, time-matched electrocardiogram (ECG) and PK data will be collected in a subset of at least 60 patients participating to Study A5481008 (see Schedule of Activities
table  and Section 7.2.2 for further details).
Results from Study A5481008 showed that in the QTc analysis population, no patients had a postbaseline absolute mean maximum QTcF or QTcS of ≥500 msec or a maximum increase 
from QTcF or QTcS baseline of ≥[ADDRESS_4197] analysis of the QTc data in the QTc analysis population demonstrated that the upper bounds of the 1-sided 95% CI for the mean change time-matched from baseline for QTcF, QTcS and QTcB were <10 msec at all time points in the QTc assessment period, indicating that palbociclib, when added to letrozole at the recommended dosing regimen, did not prolong QT interval to a clinically meaningful extent.

Page [IP_ADDRESS]. Preclinical Ocular Data
Preliminary results from an ongoing 27-week repeat-dose oral toxicity study with 
PD-0332991 in Sprague-Dawley rats identified a potential nonclinical safety finding related to the eye. Palbociclib was administered by [CONTACT_4644] 0, 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg/day in males and 0, 50, 100, and 300 mg/kg/day in females (20/sex/group; 15/sex/group in main and 5/sex/group in recovery) on an intermittent dosing schedule (7 cycles of treatment where each cycle consisted of 3 weeks of continuous daily dosing followed by a 1-week non-dosing period) for [ADDRESS_4198] 
ophthalmoscopy and by [CONTACT_4645] (within 7 days prior to scheduled necropsy). Indirect ophthalmoscopy results revealed a degraded view of the fundus and the presence of cataracts in males treated at high dose(100 mg/kg/day) that had normal fundus examinations prior to the start of the study. Cataracts (anterior cortical, incomplete, and complete) were identified by [CONTACT_4646] ≥30 mg/kg/day with dose-related severity ( Table 1 ), but not in 
females at any dose tested (up to 300 mg/kg/day).
Lens degeneration was observed microscopi[INVESTIGATOR_4565]-related incidence and with 
minimal to moderate severity in males at ≥30 mg/kg/day and minimal severity in males at 
10 mg/kg/day and females at ≤ 100 mg/kg/day (not identified in females at 300 mg/kg/day).  
Lens degeneration was identified in all animals that were noted with cataracts by [CONTACT_4647].
The available data suggests that the cataracts and/or lens degeneration observed at the lowest 
doses in both male and female rats are palbociclib-related. Exposures in this non clinical study are comparable to clinical exposures at the recommended human dose of 125 mg QD (unbound AUC 301 ng•h/mL).
The mechanism for cataract formation in palbociclib-treated rats is unknown; however, 
emergent data from the 27-week rat toxicity study suggested its pathogenesis in rats may be 
related to altered glucose metabolism.  Ten of [ADDRESS_4199] glycosuria (+2 or +3) and/or increased serum glucose (compared to the upper range of control values).  One of 3 female rats with lens degeneration also had glycosuria and hyperglycemia.  In addition to the correlation observed between altered glucose metabolism and lens degeneration, a correlation between altered glucose metabolism and pancreatic islet cell vacuolation was identified in all (10 of 10) male animals with the histological change.  In females, the one female with lens degeneration that correlated with glycosuria and hyperglycemia also had pancreatic islet cell vacuolation. No altered glucose levels, cataracts/lens degeneration, or pancreatic islet cell vacuolation have been observed in the 39-week dog toxicity study.  
To date, approximately [ADDRESS_4200] enrolled in palbociclib trials. A review of the 
[COMPANY_007] safety database for cases received through 14 January 2014 identified no serious cases from clinical studies or other solicited sources including palbociclib or blinded therapy that included adverse events which code to the MedDRA (Version 16.1) High Level Group Term “Anterior eye structural change, deposit and degeneration”. In addition, no cases coding to

67Cataract is also a 
known finding in patients treated with tamoxifen or letrozole.66,[ADDRESS_4203]-in-human Phase 1 trial (N= 74). In this trial, 2 treatment schedules (3 weekson/1 week off [n= 39]; and 2 weeks on/1 week off [n= 33]) were evaluated at escalatingdosing levels (25-225mg) of single-agent palbociclib. In the 3/1 and 2/1 schedules,16 (41.0%) and 12 (36.4%) subjects experienced a worsening of serum glucose to Grade 1from their pre study baseline, respectively; 6 (15.4%) and 2 (6.1%) worsening to Grade 2 from their baseline, respectively; and 1 (2.6%) and 2 (6.1%) worsening to Grade 3 from their baseline, respectively. No subjects experienced a worsening of serum glucose to Grade 4 from their baseline on this study. Of the 4 cases of Grade 3 elevated serum glucose measurements observed on-study (independent of worsening from baseline), [ADDRESS_4204] of duration of exposure or dose on glucose levels. Additionally, the incidence of hyperglycemia seen in Study A5481001 may beexplained by [CONTACT_4648].
Glucose laboratory tests were not collected in the PALOMA-1 (A5481003) randomized 
Phase 1/[ADDRESS_4205] cancer patients (n= 172 received study treatment); however, clinical adverse event reports ofelevated glucose levels or diabetes mellitus terms were evaluated. On the palbociclib + letrozole arm, in patients known to be non-diabetic (n = 85) there was 1 report of Grade 2diabetes mellitus in a patient who started to receive an anti-diabetic medication while on study. In patients known to be diabetic (n = 10), there was 1 report of Grade 2hyperglycaemia. On the letrozole alone arm, in patients known to be non-diabetic (n =71) there was 1 report of Grade 2 diabetes mellitus in a patient who also started to receive ananti-diabetic medication while on study, and 1 report of Grade 1 hyperglycaemia in another patient who did not initiate any anti-diabetic medication. In patients known to be diabetic (n = 6) there were no reports of hyperglycaemia. In summary, there was no apparent imbalance in the rate of hyperglycemia/diabetes mellitus adverse events in PALOMA-1.

[IP_ADDRESS]. PD-0332991 Dose Rationale
PD-0332991 has been tested in a Phase 1 dose escalation Study (A5481001) in 74 patients 
with advanced cancer.  Two dosing schedules were evaluated: Schedule 3/1 (3 weeks on treatment/1 week off treatment) and Schedule 2/1 (2 weeks on treatment/1 week off treatment).
All DLTs observed in this study were related to myelosuppression and mainly consisted of 
Grade [ADDRESS_4207] common non-hematological adverse events included fatigue, anemia, diarrhea, constipation, vomiting and dyspnea, all with mild to moderate severity.  A greater proportion of patients on the 2/1 schedule had treatment-related TEAEs during and after Cycle 1 than patients on the 3/[ADDRESS_4208] to the 2 dosing schedules, both during and after Cycle 1.  One partial response was reported in a patient with testicular cancer.  A total of 13/37 patients treated with Schedule 3/1 evaluable for efficacy experienced stable disease (SD), including 6 patients with SD lasting 40 weeks or longer.  One of these patients was a  with ER+ breast cancer who had previouslyreceived 7 lines of treatment for  disease.  This patient remained on treatment for 80 weeks (7 cycles at 50 mg/d and 13 cycles at 75 mg/d) and eventually discontinued treatment due to disease progression.  Based on the relatively improved safety profile of Schedule 3/1, and the efficacy results from this study, the Schedule 3/1 has been selected for further clinical development and the RP2D for this schedule was determined to be 125 mg/d.  This schedule and associated RP2D was further explored in combination with letrozole in the Phase I/II study in patients with ABC described below. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Phase I/II Data in Combination with Letrozole in Advanced Breast Cancer
Based on the preclinical evidence that PD-0332991 is highly active in ER(+) cell lines and 
the encouraging safety and PK profiles observed in the initial clinical studies, a randomized, multicenter active-controlled Phase 1/2 Study (A5481003) was designed to assess the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of letrozole 2.5 mg QD (continuously) in combination with PD-0332991 125 mg QD (schedule 3/1) versus single agent letrozole 2.5 mg QD (continuously) for the first-line treatment of ER(+), HER2 (-) ABC in postmenopausal women. Letrozole was selected as the active control based on its worldwide approval and use as standard of care for the first-line hormonal treatment of postmenopausal women with ER(+) ABC.

In Part 2, patients were prospectively selected also taking into account tumor CCND1 amplification and/or p16 loss. As of [ADDRESS_4210] been enrolled in this study and enrollment is closed. Twelve (12) were enrolled in the Phase 1 portion and 165 (66 and 99 in Part 1 and 2, respectively) were enrolled in the Phase 2 portion.
Results from the Phase 1 portion,
68indicated no PK interaction between PD-0332991 and 
letrozole with mean AUC(0-24) of 2002 and 2043 ng•hr/mL (n=11) for PD-0332991 in the 
absence and presence of letrozole, respectively, and 1990 and 1730 ng•hr/mL (n=10) for letrozole in the absence and presence of PD-0332991, respectively. The RP2D was determined to be 125 mg QD on Schedule 3/1 (3 weeks continuous treatment followed by 1 week off treatment) in combination with letrozole 2.5 mg QD continuously.  Partial responses were reported for 3 (33%) out of 9 patients with measurable disease (3 had 
bone-only disease). Another 5 patients (42%) had stable disease for ≥6 months and the 
clinical benefit rate (PR + SD ≥ 6 months) was 67%. Eight (8) patients discontinued from the 
study due to disease progression, including [ADDRESS_4211] Cancer Conference
69and included a total of 66 postmenopausal women with 
ER(+)/HER2(-) locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer randomized to either receive PD-0332991 in combination with letrozole (n=34 patients) or letrozole monotherapy (n=32 patients). 
The combination therapy was generally well tolerated when compared to letrozole alone with 
AEs similar to those seen with PD-[ADDRESS_4212] frequent adverse eventswith neutropenia (54%), leucopenia (21%) being the most commonly reported Grade 2 events in patients treated with the combination therapy. Grade 4 events included neutropenia and fatigue, each reported in 6% of patients treated with PD-0332991 + letrozole. No Grade 4 events were reported in the letrozole alone arm.  Treatment-related Grade 1/2 AEs reported more frequently in patients in the PD-0332991 + letrozole arm compared with the letrozole alone arm included: leukopenia, anemia, fatigue, alopecia, arthralgia, nausea, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia.  Hot flush was the most common Grade 1/2 treatment-related AE reported in patients enrolled in theletrozole alone arm.
Overall, 3 (9%) patients in the PD-0332991 + letrozole arm and 1 (3%) patient in the 
letrozole arm discontinued the Part 1 Phase 2 of Study A5481003 due to AEs including: 1 patient with Grade 4 fatigue (not related to PD-0332991) and 2 patients with Grade 3 neutropenia in the PD-0332991 + letrozole arm and 1 patient with Grade 2 nausea in

PD-0332991 + letrozole arm vs 5.4 months in the letrozole alone arm, with PD-0332991 dosing interruptions and dose reductions due to AEs reported in 61% and 39% of patients enrolled in the PD-0332991 + letrozole arm, respectively. The median duration of dosing interruptions was 4.[ADDRESS_4213] dosing interruption was 55.5 days.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_4566]/or reductions, the median dose intensity for PD-0332991 was 87% across all cycles. 
Efficacy analyses were performed on the basis of radiologic assessment of disease status by
[CONTACT_4649] v.1.0. After a median follow-up of 16.5 months, median PFS was prolonged in patients who received combination therapy compared to letrozole alone (18.2 months vs 5.7 months).  Objective response and clinical benefit rates (52% vs 32% and 76% vs 47%, respectively) were also superior with the combination therapy. No complete responses were observed.  Data from the Part 2 are not yet mature.
These results indicate that the combination of PD-0332991 with letrozole is well tolerated 
with AEs similar to those seen with either PD-0332991 or letrozole when administered alone. Additionally, the combination demonstrated antitumor activity which was consistent with the sensitivity of ER(+) breast cancer observed in the preclinical models.  Results from Part [ADDRESS_4214]-line treatment setting, letrozole is among the preferred anti-hormonal therapi[INVESTIGATOR_4567](+)/HER2(-) ABC.
70  It is approved and commercially 
available globally with a well known and manageable safety profile. However, median progression-free survival in this patient population remains less than 1 year and median overall survival is approximately 3 years.
4  Furthermore, aromatase inhibitor failure has been 
linked to increased proliferative index and cell cycle dysregulation, providing a strong rationale for combining letrozole with PD-0332991. Preliminary data from Phase 1/[ADDRESS_4215] that the combination of PD-0332991 inhibition ofCDK 4/6 (blocking DNA synthesis by [CONTACT_4642] G1 to S phase) with the antiproliferative effects of letrozole provides greater antitumor activity and prolongs PFS (ie, median 18.2 months vs 5.7 months) when compared to single agent letrozole. Additionally, the study shows that the combination is generally well tolerated with uncomplicated neutropenia as the most frequent adverse event.
69
The current Phase 3 study provides the opportunity to confirm the clinical benefit of the combination of PD-0332991 with letrozole observed in Study A5481003. The study is designed to demonstrate that PD-0332991 in combination with letrozole provides superiorclinical benefit compared to letrozole in combination with placebo in postmenopausal women with ER(+)/HER2(-) locoregionally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer who have not received any prior systemic anti-cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_4554].

1.2.7. Amendment Rationale 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Rationale for Changes in Amendment 1, [ADDRESS_4216] from the French Regulatory Agency to 
emphasize the importance of obtaining tumor tissue from a recurrence/metastatic disease at the time of study entry. The protocol language was revised accordingly and implemented for [LOCATION_009] only.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Rationale for Changes in Amendment 2, [ADDRESS_4217] frequently asked eligibility-related questions and minimize potential patient enrollment errors. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Rationale for Changes in Amendment 3, 21 March 2014
Taking into account the preliminary results from studies A5481018 and A5481021, it was
assumed that drug exposures before and after implementation of Amendment 2 might be different in patients who took palbociclib in a minimally fasted state (ie, fast from 1 hour before to 2 hours after dosing) and/or concomitantly with proton-pump inhibitors compared to those patients who did not. This difference could potentially reduce the statistical power to detect the true treatment effect of palbociclib in the intent to treat (ITT) population under the current study design. As a result, the protocol is being amended prior to the interim analysis to increase the sample size from 450 patients to 650 patients to preserve the desired statistical power. 
Additionally, based on the limited pre-clinical and clinical data currently available, it is not 
known whether true clinical risk exists for developi[INVESTIGATOR_4568]-associated cataracts. The protocol is therefore being amended to implement prospective ophthalmic assessments in all newly enrolled, lens grading patients at baseline and while on study treatment. The results of the ophthalmic assessments will provide a better understanding of the risk of ocular adverse events and will provide information to determine whether further actions are warranted.

Language related to cycle delay was also furthe r defined to clearly state that any new cycle 
may only start if blinded study treatment can be resumed.
Lastly, further clarification, was also added in the Concomitant Medications Section 5.5 : 
editorial changes were made to differentiate between strong and moderate CYP3A 
inducers/inhibitors, restriction on CYP3A substrate was removed based on updated information indicating that palbociclib is a weak time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A, and local antacids and H

Section 5.5.[ADDRESS_4219] the exposure of palbociclib.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Rationale for Changes in Amendment 5, 02 December 2014
In the current study design, an interim analysis will be performed after approximately 
266 PFS events occur (about 65% of total PFS events needed for final analysis) using O’Brien-Fleming efficacy boundary  (Lan-DeMets procedure). Under these conditions, the 
study could be stopped for efficacy if z ≥2.[ADDRESS_4220] ratio (HR)
≤0.6979, or about 4 months improvement in median PFS if the median PFS of the control arm is exactly 9 months as the study design assumed. In this instance, the interim efficacy boundary, while reaching statistical significance, may not represent a clinically meaningful improvement. 
The interim analysis is being revised in this protocol amendment to ensure that the study
would only be stopped at the interim analysis if the primary analysis (PFS) results arestatistically significant and clinically meaningful.
Language related to the analysis of the primary endpoint was updated to further define the
planned analysis. 
Additionally, the protocol is being amended to allow the concomitant use of strong/moderate 
CYP3A inducers/inhibitors and proton-pump inhibitors for patients who permanently discontinue blinded therapy but continue on study with letrozole monotherapy only. 
Finally, editorial changes were made to the drug destruction supply instruction to reflect 
current trial practices.

[IP_ADDRESS]. Rationale for Changes in Amendment 8, 21 May 2018
The present study met its primary objective of improving investigator-assessed PFS at the 
final analysis (data cutoff of 26 February 2016), demonstrating that in postmenopausalwomen with ER-positive/HER2-negative ABC who had not received any prior systemic anti-cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_3917]/metastatic disease, the addition of palbociclib to letrozole resulted in statistically significant, robust, and clinically meaningful 10-month improvement in median PFS (42% risk reduction) as compared with placebo plus letrozole (24.8 months vs 14.5 months, HR=0.576 [95% CI: 0.463, 0.718], 1 sided p<0.000001). Prolongation of PFS in the palbociclib plus letrozole arm was also demonstrated in multiple sensitivity analyses and, importantly, was consistently observed in individual patient subgroups defined by [CONTACT_4620], supporting the robustness and internal consistency of PFS benefit findings within the study. The blinded independent central review (BICR) showed no investigator bias in favor of the palbociclib plus letrozole arm and the analysis results of BICR corroborated the results of investigator-assessed PFS.
Palbociclib plus letrozole was generally well tolerated with toxicities that were manageable 
by [CONTACT_4621] (including cycle delays) (335 [75.5%] patients), dose reduction (160 [36.0%] patients), and/or standard medical therapy.  The observed AEs were generally consistent with the known safety profile of palbociclib when administered with letrozole and when letrozole is administered as monotherapy; there were no unexpected major safety findings in this study population. The most common adverse events in the palbociclib plus letrozole group were neutropenia, leukopenia, fatigue, nausea, arthralgia, and alopecia. The majority of adverse events  were mild to moderate in severity with the exception of neutropenia and leukopenia.
[ADDRESS_4223] of the secondary objectives of 
the study, the management of patients who are still receiving active treatment will be modified.  Upon IRB/IEC approval of Amendment 8, clinical assessments will be reduced in 
scope and the required schedule of activities is provided in Appendix 10. 
Guidance on management of these patients is summarized below.
Upon approval of Amendment 8, tumor assessments may be performed at a different 
schedule than the original protocol if this is common practice at that institution or it is recommended by [CONTACT_4625]’s clinical conditions. Selection of imaging studies will depend on treating physician and radiologist as per local institutional practice.  RECIST 1.1 may continue to be used to evaluate imaging assessments at the investigator’s discretion but will no longer be mandatory.  Assessments of tumor lesions [ie, target lesion(s), non-target lesion(s) and target lymph node(s)] will no longer be recorded in the CRF, nor will the RECIST assessments.  Only the date of progression of disease will be recorded.
Additionally, the retrospective review of radiographic images and clinical information 
collected on study to verify the protocol-defined endpoints of disease response and progression determinations as assessed by [CONTACT_4651], theinvestigators will no longer be required to send the tumor scans to the independent core imaging laboratory.
Considering that the results from the safety analyses from this study have been consistent 
with the known safety profile of palbociclib and no new safety findings have been identified, upon IRB/IEC approval of Amendment 8, blood chemistry will only need to be monitored on Day [ADDRESS_4224] 6 cycles, hematology for subsequent cycles will be monitored every 3 months, at the beginning (Day 1) of a cycle. For patients who experienced a maximum of Grade [ADDRESS_4225] 6 cycles, hematology will continue to be assessed at the beginning (Day 1) of each cycle.  Additionally, hemoglobin A1c will no longer be required to be measured every 3 months from the date of randomization (ie, C4D1, C7D1, etc...) but is required to be collected
at the end of treatment visit. Additional unscheduled 
hematology and blood chemistry panels may be collected as clinically indicated and results will be recorded on the appropriate CRF. 
Finally, PPIs and drugs known to prolong QT interval were removed from the “Prohibited
Medications” Section 5.5.[ADDRESS_4226] on the exposure of palbociclib and results from Study A5481008 showing that palbociclib, when added to letrozole, did not prolong QT interval to a clinically meaningful extent.

3. STUDY DESIGN
This is an international, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
parallel-group, Phase 3 clinical trial comparing the efficacy and safety of PD-0332991 in combination with letrozole versus placebo in combination with letrozole in postmenopausal women with ER(+)/HER2 (-) advanced breast cancer. Eligible patients will have histologically or cytologically proven diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the breast with evidence of locoregionally recurrent or metastatic disease and will be candidates to receiveletrozole as first-line treatment for their advanced disease. In order to avoid inclusion of patients who are refractory or resistant to non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors, patients who received anastrozole or letrozole as a component of their (neo)adjuvant regimen may only enter the study if their disease did not progress while on or within 12 months from completion of their anastrozole/letrozole-containing (neo)adjuvant therapy. Patients will not have received any prior systemic anti-cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_4555]. Patients must have measurable disease as per RECIST v.1.[ADDRESS_4227] 650 eligible patients will be randomized 2:1 to receive either PD-0332991 plus 
letrozole (Arm A: at least 433 patients) or placebo plus letrozole (Arm B: at least217 patients). Patients will be stratified by [CONTACT_4622] (visceral* vs non-visceral**), by [CONTACT_4623]-free interval since completion of prior (neo)adjuvant therapy (de novo metastatic; 
≤12 months; >12 months), and by [CONTACT_4624] (neo)adjuvant anti-cancer treatment 
received (prior hormonal therapy; no prior hormonal therapy).

•PD-0332991, 125 mg, orally once daily on Day 1 to Day 21 of every 28-day cycle 
followed by 7 days off treatment;
in combination with 
•Letrozole, 2.5 mg, orally once daily (continuously). 
Patients randomized to Arm B (control arm) will receive: 
•Placebo orally once daily on Day 1 to Day 21 of every 28-day cycle followed by 7 days off treatment;
in combination with 
•Letrozole, 2.5 mg, orally once daily (continuously). 
Patients will continue to receive assigned treatment until objective disease progression, 
symptomatic deterioration, unacceptable toxicity, death, or withdrawal of consent, whichever occurs first.  However, patients may continue treatment as assigned at randomization beyond the time of PD at the discretion of the investigator if that is considered to be in the best interest of the patient and as long as no new anti-cancer treatment is initiated. In this case, the patient would continue with routine safety relevant assessments as per the Schedule of 
Activities for the active treatment period.
The importance of timely and complete disease assessments in this study cannot be 
overstated. Disease assessments will be performed every 12 weeks ( ±7 days) from the date 
of randomization. Patients with bone lesions identified at baseline will also have repeat bone scans performed every 24 weeks ( ±7 days) from the date of randomization.  Each assessment 
will be performed as scheduled according to the calendar regardless of any dosing delay to 
prevent the introduction of bias into the assessment of efficacy. Failure to perform any of the 
required disease assessments will result in the inability to determine disease status for that 
time point.  Tumor assessments will be performed until radiographically and/or clinically (ie, for photographed or palpable lesions) documented PD as per RECIST v.1.1, study treatment discontinuation (for patients continuing treatment beyond RECIST-defined disease progression), initiation of new anti-cancer therapy or discontinuation of patient from overall study participation (eg, death, patient's request, lost to follow-up), whichever occurs first.  A series of incomplete disease assessments will result in censoring of the primary endpoint of PFS back to the time of the last full assessment that did not show progression. 
Upon IRB/IEC approval of Amendment 8, tumor assessments may be performed at a 
different schedule than the original protocol if this is common practice at that institution or it 
is recommended by [CONTACT_4625]’s clinical conditions. Selection of imaging studies will depend on treating physician and radiologist as per local institutional practice.  RECIST 1.1 may continue to be used to evaluate imaging assessments at the

target lesion(s), non-target lesion(s) and target lymph node(s)] will no longer be recorded in the CRF, nor will the RECIST assessments.  Only the date of progression of disease will be recorded. Please refer to Appendix [ADDRESS_4228]’s/investigator’s tumor assessments as primary data source. However, a blinded independent third-party core imaging laboratory will complete a retrospective review of radiographic images and clinical information collected on-study to verify the protocol-defined endpoints of disease response and progression as assessed by [CONTACT_093].  Upon IRB/IEC approval of Amendment [ADDRESS_4229]-B questionnaire, survival and new anti-cancer therapy information (including regimen number, name [CONTACT_4741], start/stop dates, and dates of disease progression on subsequent anti-cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) will be collected every [ADDRESS_4230]. The follow-up period will conclude at the time of the final OS analysis. Crossover will not be allowed in the trial. 
Patients will undergo study-related safety, efficacy, and PK assessments as outlined in the

5. STUDY TREATMENTS
5.1. Allocation to Treatment
If the patient is found to be eligible for the study, she should be randomized using a 
centralized internet/telephone registration system no more than [ADDRESS_4242] complete a Patient Pre-Randomization Form which includes key eligibility criteria (eg, breast cancer diagnosis, stage of disease at initial diagnosis and at screening, hormonal receptor and HER2 status as per local results, prior systemic therapy, disease free interval (DFI) from prior (neo)adjuvant letrozole or anastrozole (if applicable)) and send it to the sponsor for approval of randomization.  Upon receipt of the sponsor’s approval the site must contact a centralized internet/telephone registration system as described in the Study Reference Manual, to enroll the patient on study (see Section 4.3 ). 
Eligible patients will be randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to either Arm A (experimental arm: PD-0332991 plus letrozole) or Arm B (control arm: placebo plus letrozole) stratified according to site of disease, disease-free interval since completion of prior (neo)adjuvant therapy, and nature of prior (neo)adjuvant anti-cancer treatment received (see Section 4.3 ).
Clinical sites must complete the screening case report forms (CRFs) for all registered and

[IP_ADDRESS]. PD-0332991/Placebo
Patients should be instructed to swallow PD-0332991/placebo capsules whole and not to 
chew them prior to swallowing.  No capsule should be ingested if it is broken, cracked, or otherwise not intact.  Patients should be encouraged to take their dose at approximately the same time each day.  Patients should be instructed to record daily administration of the study drugs in a patient diary.
PD-0332991/placebo will be administered together with letrozole. Patients should take 
PD-0332991/placebo with food. For patients enrolled in Group 1, patients should fast from 1 hour before to 2 hours after dosing, during Cycle 1.  Cycle 2 and beyond, patients should take PD-0332991/placebo with food. 
PD-0332991/placebo will be administered orally once a day for 21 days of every 28-day 
cycle followed by 7 days off treatment. In the event the Day 1 clinic visit of the subsequent cycle is scheduled during the -2 day allowable visit time window (ie, Day 27, Day 28), patients must be instructed to complete their 7-day off treatment period of the current cycle prior to resuming blinded therapy even if criteria for treatment resumption are met at the visit.

Page 615.3.4. Dose Modification
Every effort should be made to administer study treatment on the planned dose and schedule.  
However, in the event of significant treatment-related toxicity, administration of study drugs (PD-0332991/placebo or letrozole) may need to be adjusted as described in the following sections. Depending on the nature of the toxicity observed, dosing adjustment may be required for just one or both study drugs in the combination.  In the event treatment interruption is deemed necessary for just one of the study drugs in the combination, treatment with the other study drug will continue as planned. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Letrozole 
No dose adjustment for letrozole is permitted but dosing interruptions are allowed.  
Treatment interruption for letrozole-related toxicities will be performed as per the investigator’s best medical judgment.
Patients discontinuing letrozole treatment due to treatment-related toxicity will be 
discontinued from the active treatment phase of the study and enter the follow-up phase. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. PD-0332991/Placebo
In the event of significant treatment-related toxicity, PD-0332991/placebo dosing may be 
interrupted or delayed and/or reduced as described below.  In the event of multiple toxicities, dose modification should be based on the worst toxicity observed.  Patients are to be instructed to notify Investigators at the first occurrence of any adverse sign or symptom.
Dose modifications may occur in three ways:
•Within a cycle: dosing interruption until adequate recovery and dose reduction, if 
required, during a given treatment cycle;
•Between cycles: next cycle administration may be delayed due to persisting toxicitywhen a new cycle is due to start;
•In the next cycle: dose reduction may be required in a subsequent cycle based on toxicity experienced in the previous cycle.
Patients discontinuing PD-0332991/placebo treatment due to treatment-related toxicity may 
continue on the active treatment phase of the study receiving letrozole monotherapy as perthe investigator’s discretion. 
[IP_ADDRESS].1. Dosing Interruptions
Patients experiencing the following adverse events should have their treatment 
interrupted/delayed: 
•Uncomplicated Grade 3 neutropenia (ANC<1000/mm
3);

Page 62•Grade 3 neutropenia (ANC<1000/mm3) associated with a documented infection or 
fever ≥38.5°C;
•Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC<500/mm3);
•Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (Platelet count <25,000/mm3);
•Grade≥3 non-hematologic toxicity (including, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and 
hypertension only if persisting despi[INVESTIGATOR_4570]);
•Grade 3 QTc prolongation (QTc ≥[ADDRESS_4248] two separate ECGs).
Appropriate follow up assessments should be done until adequate recovery occurs as 
assessed by [CONTACT_737]. Criteria required before treatment can resume are described inSection [IP_ADDRESS].2.
Doses may be held as needed until toxicity resolution. Depending on when the adverse event 
resolved, a treatment interruption m ay lead to the patient missing all subsequent planned 
doses within that same cycle or eve n to delay the initiation of the subsequent cycle. 
If the adverse event that led to the treatment interruption recovers within the same cycle, then 
re-dosing in that cycle is allowed. Doses omitted for toxicity are not replaced within the same cycle.  The need for a dose reduction at the time of treatment resumption should be based on the criteria defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS].3 Dose Reductions unless expressly agreed otherwise 
following discussion between the investigator and the sponsor. If a dose reduction is applied in the same cycle, the patient will need to return to the clinic to receive new drug supply.
In the event of a treatment interruption for reasons other than treatment-related toxicity
(eg, non-cancer related surgery) lasting >2 weeks, treatment resumption will be decided in 
consultation with the sponsor.
[IP_ADDRESS].2. Dose Delay
Retreatment following treatment interruption for treatment-related toxicity or at the start of 
any new cycle may not occur until all of the following parameters have been met:
•Platelet count ≥50,000/mm3;
•ANC ≥1000/mm3and no fever;
•Grade 3 or higher treatment-related non-hematologic AEs (including, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, and hypertension only if persisting despi[INVESTIGATOR_4571]), with the exception of alopecia, have recovered to Grade ≤1 or baseline 
(or, at the investigator’s discretion, Grade ≤2 if not considered a safety risk for the 
patient).

Page 63•QTc <501 msec and potential reversible causes (eg, electrolyte imbalance, 
concomitant medications known to prolong QTc) corrected.  If QTc remains above 
480 msec, ECG should be monitored more frequently as per the investigator’s best 
medical judgement until QTc ≤480 msec.
If a treatment delay results from decline in hematologic parameters, the frequency of blood 
count assessments should be increased as clinically indicated.
If these parameters are met within 2 weeks of treatm ent interruption or cycle dela y, 
PD-0332991/placebo may be resumed. Please refer  to Section [IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_4249] not been met after 2 weeks of dosing interruption (including the 
scheduled 1 week off treatment) or 2 weeks of cycle delay, permanent discontinuation of PD-0332991/placebo treatment should be considered.  Treatment resumption for patients recovering from treatment-related toxicity after >2 weeks of treatment interruption or cycle delay but deemed to be deriving obvious clinical benefit per the investigator’s best medical judgment is left at the investigator’s discretion.
A new cycle only starts when the criteria listed above are met and blinded study treatment
may be administered, otherwise initiation of the new cycle must be delayed until such criteria 
are met. 
In the event that the start of a new cycle is delayed due to treatment related toxicity, 
procedures required on Day 1 of the given cycle will be performed when PD-0332991/placebo is resumed. New cycle Day 1 procedures (ie, physical examination, ECOG performance status, ECG, Quality of Life questionnaires, blood chemistry, hematology) that were performed prior to knowing the need to delay the start of the cycle do not need to be repeated unless required to confirm that the parameters necessary for study drug to be resumed are met (see Section [IP_ADDRESS].2).
[IP_ADDRESS].3. Dose Reductions
Following dosing interruption or cycle delay the PD-0332991/placebo dose may need to be 
reduced when treatment is resumed.
No specific dose adjustments are recommended for Grade 1/2 treatment-related toxicity.  
However, investigators should always manage their patients according to their medical judgment based on the particular clinical circumstances.
Dose reduction of PD-0332991/placebo by 1 and, if needed, 2 dose levels ( Table 2 ) will be 
allowed depending on the type and severity of toxicity encountered.  Patients requiring more 
than 2 dose reductions will be discontinued from the study and entered into the follow-up phase. All dose modifications/adjustments must be clearly documented in the patient's source notes and Investigational product administration CRF.

In the event of QTc prolongation of, possible alternative reversible causes such as serum 
electrolytes abnormalities, or usage of concomitant medications with the potential to prolong the QTc interval should be evaluated. 
If such reversible causes are identified, then they should be corrected accordingly
(ie, correction of electrolyte abnormalities with supplements to within normal limits and/ordiscontinuation (if possible) of concomitant medications known to prolong the QT interval). 
Recommended dose modifications in the event of QTc prolongation are provided in Table 4.

Page 705.6. Concomitant Radiotherapy or Surgery
Any concurrent radiotherapy (except palliative radiotherapy as specified below) or 
cancer-related surgery are prohibited throughout the duration of the active treatment phase of 
the study. Patients requiring any of these procedures will be discontinued from the active 
treatment phase and will enter the follow-up phase.
Palliative radiotherapy is permitted for the treatment of painful bony lesions provided that the 
lesions were known to be present at the time of study entry and the investigator clearly documents that the need for palliative radiotherapy is not indicative of disease progression.  In view of the current lack of data about the interaction of PD-0332991 with radiotherapy, PD-0332991/placebo treatment should be interrupted during palliative radiotherapy, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] 1 day before and resuming treatment 1 week after. For patients with bone involvement, it is suggested to institute palliative radiotherapy before study initiation if possible and clinically appropriate (eg, lesions at risk for spontaneous micro-fractures or painful lesions).  Palliative radiotherapy during the active treatment phase will be considered alternative cancer therapy and will result in censoring of the PFS endpoint. The dates on which palliative radiotherapy is administered should be recorded on the appropriate CRFs.
Caution is advised on theoretical grounds for any surgical procedures during the study.  The 
appropriate interval of time between surgery and PD-0332991 required to minimize the risk of impaired wound healing and bleeding has not been determined.  Based on the available pharmacokinetic data, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_4580]-0332991/placebo is recommended at least 7 days prior to elective surgery.  Postoperatively, the decision to reinitiate PD-0332991/placebo treatment should be based on a clinical assessment of satisfactory wound healing and recovery from surgery.
6. STUDY PROCEDURES
Prior to undergoing any study specific pro cedures (with the exception of certain imaging 
assessments if meeting the criteria defined in Section 6.1), patien ts must read and sign the 
consent form.  All study procedures and th e timing when they must be performed are detailed 
in the Schedule of Activities tables . All data obtained for these a ssessments must be 
supported in the patients' source documentation.
For the purposes of this trial, [ADDRESS_4254] be obtained before any study 
specific procedures are performed (with the exception of certain imaging assessments if meeting the criteria defined in this section); however, it may be obtained more than 28 days before randomization.

Flowchart ) that were performed before the signing of the informed consent form as routine 
procedures (but within 28 days prior to randomization ) do not need to be repeated and may 
be used as baseline assessments, as long as:
•The tests were performed per the method requirements outlined in the 
Tumor Assessment Requirement Flowchart , the Efficacy Assessments sections . 
•Appropriate documentation indicating that these radiographic tumor assessments were performed as standard of care is available in the patient’s source notes.
Bone scans performed as routine procedures within 12 weeks
prior to randomization may 
also be accepted as baseline assessment if they meet the same requirements listed above.
Brain scans performed as routine procedures within 6 weeks prior to randomization may also 
be accepted as baseline assessment if they meet the same requirements listed above.Once Amendment 3 is IRB approved, all lens grading evaluable, newly enrolled patients will 
undergo the following ophthalmic procedures at baseline: 
•Best corrected distant visual acuity (Snellen).
•Refractive error associated with best corrected distant visual acuity.
•Intraocular pressure (IOP - one reading).
•Slit lamp biomicroscopy of the anterior segment including cell count and flare 
grading.
•Lens grading with the Wisconsin Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) [ADDRESS_4255]
(See Appendix 8) - (pupil dilated examination).
•Funduscopy (Ophthalmoscopy - pupil dilated examination). 
Patients with ophthalmic conditions (eg, anophthalmus, phthisis, aphakia, pseudophakia) that would prevent grading of the lens in both eyes will not be considered evaluable for this ophthalmic assessment and do not need to undergo these ophthalmic procedures. Reasons for not being evaluable must be clearly documented in the patient source notes. 
All ophthalmic examinations will be performed by [CONTACT_4674]. Refer to 
Section 7.2.[ADDRESS_4256] provide for all screen failures the following information using the 
appropriate case report forms (CRFs): screening number, demographic data as well as the final subject summary including the reason for screening failure.
6.2. Active Treatment Phase
For details on procedures during the active treatment phase, see the Schedule of Activities
tables . Please refer to Appendix 10 for the Schedule of Activities for patients continuing to 
receive active treatment after IRB/IEC approval of Amendment 8.
In the event that the start of a new cycle is delayed due to treatment-related toxicity, 
procedures required on Day 1 of the given cycle will be performed when PD-0332991/placebo is resumed. New cycle Day 1 procedures (ie, physical examination, ECOG performance status, ECG, Quality of Life questionnaires, blood chemistry, hematology) that were performed prior to knowing the need to delay the start of the cycle do not need to be repeated unless required to confirm that the parameters necessary for study drug to be resumed are met (see Section [IP_ADDRESS].2 ).
All lens-grading evaluable patients randomized under Amendment 3 will repeat screeningophthalmic procedures also during the active treatment phase after 3 months (Cycle 4 Day 1), 6 months (Cycle 7 Day 1), 12 months (Cycle 13 Day 1) then every 12 months (Day 1 of Cycles 25, 37, etc…) thereafter. Additional ophthalmic examinations may be repeated during the study as clinically indicated (including for patients randomized prior to Amendment 3 approval). 
6.3. End of Treatment Visit
The end of treatment visit will be performed as soon as possible but no later than 4 weeks 
(ie, 28 days) ±[ADDRESS_4257] and prior to the initiation of 
any new anti-cancer therapy.
All lens-grading evaluable patients randomized under Amendment 3 will repeat screening
ophthalmic procedures also at the End of Treatment visit.

(including regimen number/name [CONTACT_4742]-study anti-cancer therapy, start/stop dates,
and dates of disease progression on subsequent anti-cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) will be 
collected approximately every 6 months ( ±7 days) from the last dose of 
investigational product until patient permanent discontinuation from study or end of 
follow-up period whichever occurs first. Telephone contact [CONTACT_4631].
•In addition, post-study breast cancer specific quality of life questionnaire (FACT-B) 
will also be collected every 6 months ( ±7 days) from the last dose of investigational 
product until patient permanent discontinuation from study or end of follow-up period 
whichever occurs first.  During the follow-up period, all self-assessment questionnaires should preferably be completed by [CONTACT_4675] a scheduled clinic visit. However, if no clinic visits are being scheduled during the follow-up period interviewer administration via phone call may be used instead and documented 
accordingly in the patient source notes.
For details on follow-up visit procedures, see the Schedule of Activities tables . 
The follow-up period will conclude at the time of the final OS analysis.
6.5. Patient Withdrawal
6.5.1. Active Treatment Phase Discontinuation
The term "interruption" refers to a patient stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_4581], but then re-starting it at a later time in the study.  The reason for dosing interruption will be collected on the appropriate CRF. 
The term "discontinuation" refers to a patient's withdrawal from the active treatment phase.  
The reason for discontinuation from treatment will be collected on the appropriate CRF. 
Patients may be withdrawn from the active treatment phase
in case of:
•Disease progression;
•Symptomatic deterioration (ie, global deterioration of health status requiring 
discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of disease progression);
•Need for additional anti-cancer therapy not specified in the protocol;
•Unacceptable toxicities;
•Investigator conclusion that it is in the patient’s best interest to discontinue therapy 
(eg, poor compliance with either protocol monitoring or with taking the study medications, etc);

*If a patient does not return for a scheduled visit, every effort should be made to contact [CONTACT_4677]. If after [ADDRESS_4258] the patient, one of which is by [CONTACT_4678], the patient should be considered “lost to follow-up”. Steps taken to contact [CONTACT_102] (eg, dates of telephone calls, registered letters, etc) must be clearly documented in the source documents.
Patient who discontinue from the active treatment phase must have end of 
treatment/withdrawal evaluations performed as soon as possible but no later than [ADDRESS_4259] and prior to initiation of any new anti-cancertherapy.  Data to be collected for the end of study treatment/withdrawal are described in the Schedule of Activities tables . 
If a patient opts to discontinue from the active treatment phase as a result of an unacceptable adverse drug reaction, "withdrawal of consent" should not be the reason for discontinuation.  Instead, the reason for discontinuation of active treatment phase, must be recorded as "Unacceptable toxicity" and an appropriate action taken must be assigned on the AE CRF to the adverse event leading to the patient’s withdrawal of consent. 
6.5.2. Study Discontinuation
Patients may withdraw from the study at any time at their own request, or they may be 
withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the investigator or sponsor for safety or behavioral reasons, or the inability of the patient to comply with the protocol required schedule of study visits or procedures at a given study site.
Patients will be withdrawn from study
in the case of:
•Withdrawal of consent (ie, refuses tumor assessments or survival status after end of 
treatment);
•Lost to follow-up;*
•Death.
*If a patient does not return for a scheduled visit, every effort should be made to contact [CONTACT_4677].  If after three unsuccessful attempts to contact [CONTACT_102], one of which is by [CONTACT_4678], the patient should be considered “lost to follow-up”.  Steps taken to contact [CONTACT_102] (eg, dates of telephone calls, registered letters, etc) must be clearly documented in the source documents.  In any circumstance, every effort should be made to document patient 

PD-[ADDRESS_4260](s), request the patient to return for a final visit, if applicable, and follow-up with the patient regarding any unresolved adverse events (AEs).
Data to be collected for the end of study treatment/withdrawal are described in the Schedule 
of Activities tables . 
If the patient withdraws from the study, and also withdraws consent for disclosure of future 
information, no further evaluations should be performed, and no additional data should be collected.  The sponsor may retain and continue to use any data collected before such withdrawal of consent.
7. ASSESSMENTS
All study procedures are described in the Schedule of Activities tables footnotes.
Every effort should be made to ensure that the protocol required tests and procedures are 
completed as described.  However, it is anticipated that from time to time there may be circumstances, outside of the control of the investigator, that may make it unfeasible to perform the test.  In these cases, the investigator will take all steps necessary to ensure the safety and well being of the patient. When a protocol-required test cannot be performed the investigator will document the reason for this and any corrective and preventive actions which he/she has taken to ensure that normal processes are adhered to as soon as possible.  The study team will be informed of these incidents in a timely fashion.
7.1. Efficacy Assessments
7.1.1. Independent Review of Disease Assessments
A blinded independent third-party core imaging laboratory will perform a retrospective
review of radiographic images and clinical infor mation collected on-study to verify the 
protocol defined endpoints of disease response and progression as assessed by [CONTACT_093]. 
It is important to the integrity of the study that all imaging studies and clinical information 
(including photographs) are forwarded to the independent core imaging laboratory as each 
patient enrolls and progresses through the study . 
Upon IRB/IEC approval of Amendment 8, the following materials no longer need to be 
forwarded for independent review:
•All imaging studies performed on study;
•Photographs of sites of disease assessed using clinical methods. 

PD-[ADDRESS_4261] the potential to weaken the conclusion of this clinicaltrial.
Please refer to Appendix 10, for tumor assessment requirements for patients continuing to 
receive active treatment after IRB/IEC approval of Amendment 8. 
Screening/baseline tumor assessment will be carried out within 28 days of randomization 
(unless otherwise specified below). 
•Disease assessment for all patients at baseline will include:
•CT or MRI scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (CAP).
•CT or MRI scan of any other sites of disease as clinically indicated. 
•Clinical assessment of superficial disease which will include photographs of all 
superficial metastatic lesions.  All lesion measurements must be recorded in the 
CRF. 
•Bone scans in order to detect bony sites of disease.  Any suspi[INVESTIGATOR_4562] 
(ie, hotspots) identified on the bone scans at baseline must be confirmed by X-ray, CT scan with bone windows or MRI.  Bone lesions identified at baseline will follow the same assessment schedule as for measurable lesions.  Baseline brain CT or MRI are only required in case signs and symptoms suggest the presence of metastatic brain disease.  Refer to Section 6.[ADDRESS_4262]-baseline tumor assessments:
For patients continuing to receive active treatment after IRB/IEC approval of Amendment 8, 
please refer to Appendix 10, for tumor assessment requirements. 
Disease assessments will be performed every 12 weeks ( ±7 days) and bone scans (as 
applicable) every 24 weeks ( ±7 days) from randomization until radiographically and/or 
clinically (ie, for photographed or palpable lesions) documented PD as per RECIST v.1.1, 
study treatment discontinuation (for patients continuing treatment beyond RECIST-defined disease progression), initiation of new anti-cancer therapy, or discontinuation of patient from overall study participation (eg, death, patient's request, lost to follow-up). Imaging  

PD-[ADDRESS_4263]-baseline tumor assessments will include:
•CT or MRI scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (CAP).
•CT or MRI scan of any other sites of disease identified at baseline.
•Clinical assessment of sites of superficial disease identified at baseline. Clinical 
assessment of superficial disease must coincide with the imaging studies and will 
include photographs of all superficial metastatic lesions. All lesion measurements must be recorded in the CRF. 
•Bone lesions imaging:
•If bone lesions were identified at baseline the following assessment must be 
performed:
•X-ray/CT scan/MRI every 12 weeks ( ±7 days) from the date of randomization
using the same modality used to confirm the bone lesions at baseline. Areas 
that have received palliative radiotherapy on study cannot be used to assess response to study treatment.
•Bone scans every 24 weeks (± 7 days) from the date of randomization and to 
confirm complete response. Abnormalities found on subsequent bone scans must also be confirmed by X-ray, CT scan, or MRI.
•If no bone lesions were identified at baseline, bone scans should be performed as 
clinically indicated (ie, patient describes new or worsening bone pain, or has 
increasing alkaline phosphatase level, or other signs and symptoms of new/progressing bone metastases) but are required to confirm complete response.  Abnormalities found on subsequent bone scans must also be confirmed by X-ray, CT scan, or MRI.
•Repeat brain scans will be required only if metastases are suspected.
The CT scans, including brain CT scan if applicable, should be performed with contrast agents unless contraindicated for medical reasons. If IV contrast is medically contraindicated, the imaging modality to be used to follow the disease (either CT without contrast or MRI) should be the modality which best evaluates the disease, and the choice should be determined by [CONTACT_4637]. MRI of the abdomen and pelvis can be substituted for CT if MRI adequately depi[INVESTIGATOR_4561]. 

PD-[ADDRESS_4264]. If MRI is used to follow-up bone lesion(s) it must be performed a few days before any treatment that may affect bone-marrow cellularity (eg, G-CSF).
73
The same method and technique should be used to characterize each lesion identified and reported at baseline, during the study treatment period and during follow-up.  The use of plain-film X-rays (with the exception of bone X-rays as detailed above) is discouraged. The use of positron emission tomography (PET) imaging as the only imaging modality is not permitted.
For patients having effusions or ascites, cases having cytological proof of malignancy should 
be recorded as non-target lesions on the tumor assessment CRFs.  Effusions that have not been evaluated using cytology or were found to be non-malignant should not be recorded on the non-target lesion CRF.
Objective tumor response will be measured using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid 
Tumors (RECIST Version 1.1, see http://www.eortc.be/recist/default.htm). Also please refer to Appendix 7. All measurements should be recorded in metric notation using a ruler or 
calipers. For patients with bone-only disease:
•Treatment outcome will be recorded in the CRF as complete response (CR), stable disease (SD) or progression (PD). 
Interpretation will be PD if:
•The malignant nature of one or more new lesions identified with bone scan is
confirmed with X-ray, or CT, or MRI scan;
•Flare observed in bone scan is followed by [CONTACT_4679];
•Clinical worsening of the disease is assessed by [CONTACT_4680](ie, new lesion(s)) is confirmed with other imaging modalities;
•Unequivocal progression of existing bone lesions.
Interpretation will be SD if:
•The malignant nature of all the new lesions identified with bone scan is not
confirmed.
In the following cases the patient will be censored at the date of prior tumor assessment with 
no PD: 1) on-study fracture; 2) on-study management of pain (palliative radiation therapy, palliative surgery), 3) clinical worsening not objectively confirmed; 4) on-study change of therapy. In all the censored cases (no objectively documented PD) tumor assessment will be performed until PD. Also, it will be at the discretion of the investigator to discontinue the study treatment.

7.1.3. Overall Survival
Following the End of Treatment visit, survival status will be collected in all patients 
(telephone contact [CONTACT_4631]) every 6 months ( ±7 days) from the last dose of study 
treatment. Information on subsequent anti-cancer therapy will also be collected (See
Section 6.4 ).
7.2. Safety Assessments
Safety assessment will consist of monitoring of all adverse events (AEs), including serious 
adverse events (SAEs), regular monitoring of hematology, serum chemistry, and routine monitoring of ECGs, physical examinations, vital signs, and ECOG performance status. 
Adverse event assessment will include type, incidence, severity (graded by [CONTACT_4681] [NCI CTCAE], Version 4.0, see Severity Assessment section), timing, seriousness, and relatedness.
Baseline tumor-related signs and symptoms will be recorded at the Cycle 1 Day 1 visit and 
then reported as adverse events during the trial if they worsen in severity or increase in frequency.

All ECGs will be performed using a 12-lead (with a 10-second rhythm strip) tracing.  ECG 
measurements will include PR interval, QT interval, RR interval, and QRS complex.  It is preferable that the machine used has a capacity to calculate the standard intervals automatically. 
ECG interval readings by [CONTACT_4635]’s algorithm will be read and interpreted at the 
investigational site for eligibility determination and patient safety monitoring and documentation stored in the source documents. 
Triplicate ECGs (referred as ECG
E) will be performed for all patients to determine the mean 
QTc interval for eligibility purpose. Patients found to be eligible will be part of one of the two groups highlighted below 
depending on which site screened the patient.  ECG frequency for each group is described below:  
•Patients in Group 1 (approximately 60 patients) will be enrolled at selected sites
and
will have their QTc monitored to evaluate the effect of PD-0332991 on QT interval via serial triplicate ECGs time-matched with PK draws.  ECGs will be obtained on the day preceding treatment initiation (Day 0) at time 0 (time of first ECG also referred to as ECG1) and then 2, 4, 6, and 8 Hrs after ECG1, and on Day 14 ofCycle 1 pre-dose (0 Hrs) and 2, 4, 6, and [ADDRESS_4266] be time-matched (clock 
time±35 minutes) with ECG assessments performed on Day 0 (eg, if the ECG1 on 
Day 0 was performed at 10:[ADDRESS_4267] 
be performed within the 9:30 AM - 10:30 AM timeframe but as close as possible to 
10:00 AM whenever feasible) .  On Day [ADDRESS_4268] 1 hour .  ECGs should be performed 
immediately before PK blood draws at respective time points.  Patients who cannot complete ECG measurements on Day 0 and/or PK-matched ECG measurements (both ECG and PK collected) on Day 14 will need to be replaced.  Additionally, triplicate ECGs will be obtained for safety monitoring at 0 hour (pre-dose) on Day 1 of Cycle 1*, Day 14 of Cycle 2, then on Day 1 of Cycles 4, 7, and 10.  ECGs beyond Cycle 10 will be performed as clinically indicated.
•Patients in Group 2 (all other patients) 
will have triplicate ECGs performed for safety 
monitoring at 0 hour (pre-dose) on Day 1 of Cycle 1*, Day [ADDRESS_4269] 1 hour .
*Note
: Triplicate ECGs do not need to be repeated on Day 1 of Cycle 1 if ECG Ewas 
performed within 7 days of the date of randomization.

Page 81Additional ECGs may be performed as clinically indicated at any time.
For the purpose of the study, triplicate ECGs are defined as three consecutive ECGs 
performed approximately 2 minutes apart but within 10 minutes for all 3 ECGs at the protocol specified timepoints (see Schedule of Activities table  for details) to determine the 
mean QTc interval. All triplicate ECG tracings will be sent electronically to a core ECG laboratory for blinded manual interval measurements. The blinded manual interval measurements from the core ECG laboratory will be used for primary statistical analysis of ECG data in Group 1 patients. 
If at any time during the course of treatment, the mean QTc is prolonged ( ≥[ADDRESS_4270] two separate ECGs, ie, CTCAE Grade ≥3), then the ECGs should be re-evaluated by a 
qualified person at the site for confirmation as soon as the finding is made, including 
verification that the machine reading is accurate. If manual reading confirms a QTc of 
≥501 msec, immediate search for reversible causes (including electrolyte abnormalities, 
hypoxia and concomitant medications for drugs with the potential to prolong the QTc 
interval) should be performed. In addition, repeat ECGs should be immediately performed hourly for at least 3 hours until the QTc interval falls below 501 msec.
•If QTc interval reverts to less than 501 msec, and in the judgment of investigator(s) in consultation with the sponsor the cause is determined to be other than study drug, treatment may be continued with regular ECG monitoring under hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4558].
•If in that timeframe the QTc intervals remain above 501 msec the study drug will be 
held until the QTc interval decreases to <501 msec. 
Prior to concluding that an epi[INVESTIGATOR_4559], 
thorough consideration should be given to potential precipi[INVESTIGATOR_4582] (eg, change in patient clinical condition, effect of concurrent medication, electrolyte disturbance) and possible evaluation by [CONTACT_4636].
If investigational product causality cannot be ruled out, Investigational product dose 
adjustment and/or discontinuation should be performed according to instructions provided in Section 5.3.4: Dose Modification.  Additional triplicate ECGs may be performed as clinically indicated.
When matched with PK sampling, ECG must be carried out before PK sample drawing such 
that the PK samples are collected at the nominal time (ie, the timing of the PK collections over rides the timing of the ECG collections). 
7.2.3. Ocular Safety Assessments
[IP_ADDRESS]. Snellen Best Corrected Visual Acuity and Refraction
Snellen visual acuity will be assessed by [CONTACT_2329] a standard wall or projection chart before 
implementing any procedures that can affect vision (eg, pupil dilation, tonometry, and gonioscopy).  The same optotype will be used throughout the study for a specific patient, and  

PD-[ADDRESS_4271] during testing.  Patients will be told that the chart contains only letters.
The line read with 2 or fewer errors will be recorded.  If 3 of the 5 letters on a line are read 
correctly, the patient will be given credit for that line.  For example, if the patient reads 
20/25 +3, 20/[ADDRESS_4272]-corrected visual acuity of 3 lines or more from the Screening visit will be 
reported as an adverse event.  An adverse event of visual acuity will be counted from the following lines: 20/20 or better, 20/25, 20/30, 20/40, 20/50, 20/60, 20/70, 20/80, 20/100, 20/125, 20/150, and 20/200.  If the acuity at screening is better than 20/20, the decrease will be calculated from 20/20.  
In the event of a decrease in visual acuity of 3 lines or more from screening, refraction will 
be rechecked at all subsequent study visits.  A change in refraction power (spherical or 
cylindrical) of ±1.25 diopters compared with the screening examination will be reported as 
an adverse event.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Intraocular Pressure Measurement
Intraocular pressure (IOP) will be measured using a calibrated Goldmann applanation 
tonometer.  Both eyes will be tested, with the right eye preceding the left eye.  The operator will initially set the dial at [ADDRESS_4273] the results, including the time assessment is made. 
Any IOP increase of greater than 10 mmHg above baseline or any IOP that increases above 
25 mm Hg will be reported as an adverse event (AE).
[IP_ADDRESS]. Slit-lamp Biomicroscopy
Slit-lamp biomicroscopy with fluorescein will be performed.  At each scheduled visit, 
deposition of pi[INVESTIGATOR_4583], conjunctivae, cornea, anterior chamber, iris, or lens (see Lens 
Grading ) will be graded as mild, moderate, or severe.  Slit-lamp biomicroscopy should 
precede IOP measurement and the administration of any pupil-dilating agent for ophthalmoscopy.
Cells and flare in the anterior chamber should be noted during the slit-lamp examination.

[IP_ADDRESS]. Lens Grading
When doing lens grading, graders must be aware of their bias, either conscious or 
unconscious, that cataract is a unidirectional disease that steadily gets worse with age. Because of this bias, if one knows the baseline or any prior lens grade, it is likely that the grade assigned at a follow-up visit will be higher. To avoid this potential observation bias, the grader will remain masked to earlier lens grading and should always start with a blank case report form (CRF).  The Wisconsin AREDS [ADDRESS_4275] 5 mm, use slit lamp with 
~10X magnification and brightest beam intensity.

[IP_ADDRESS]. Funduscopy (Ophthalmoscopy)
Funduscopy (Ophthalmoscopy) will be performed after dilation of the pupi[INVESTIGATOR_4584], retina, and optic nerve head.  At screening, any abnormalities and pathologic findings will be graded as mild, moderate, or severe.  
Any new findings or deterioration from baseline findings will be reported as an adverse 
event.
7.2.4. Other Safety Assessments
A full physical examination including an examination of all major body systems (including 
general appearance, head, ears, eyes, nose, mouth, throat, neck, thyroid, lungs, heart, breasts, abdomen, and musculoskeletal), height (at screening only), weight, blood pressure and pulse rate which may be performed by a physician, registered nurse or other qualified health care provider, will be required at screening, and Day 1 of Cycles 1 and 2. 
Symptom directed physical examinations, blood pressure and pulse rate will be performed at 
subsequent visits.
Performance Status: The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 
scale will be used (see Appendix 1). 
7.3. Pharmacokinetic Assessments
All efforts will be made to obtain the pharmacokinetic samples at the scheduled nominal time 
relative to dosing. However, samples obtained within 10 min or 10% of the nominal time AND
collected prior to administration of the investigational product on that day (with the 
exception of the planned post-dose samples that will be collected on Day 14 of Cycle 1) will be considered protocol compliant. Patients must be instructed to withhold their daily dose of study drugs on PK sampling days until the pre-dose PK sample and safety assessments (ie hematology, blood chemistry, and ECGs) have been completed.  The exact time of the sample collection and the most recent dosing time will be recorded on the CRF.  The date of missing dose should also be recorded in the CRF.
One 3 mL sample of venous blood will be collected in appropriately labeled K2 EDTA 
collection tubes for assessment of PD-0332991 (including its active metabolites, ifappropriate) levels at the protocol-specified times.  Samples will be analyzed using validated analytical methods in compliance with [COMPANY_007] standard operating procedures.  

PD-[ADDRESS_4276] on that day. In the event a pre-dose sample cannot be/is not collected on Day [ADDRESS_4277] a makeup pre-dose sample between Day 15 and Day 21 of the same cycle or between Day 14 and Day 21 of any subsequent cycles beyond Cycle 2 following the same rules described above. 
For patients participating in the dedicated QTc portion of the trial (Group 1), all PK draws at 
Day [ADDRESS_4278] been 
performed so that the PK samples are collected at the nominal time. 
Additional blood samples may be requested from patients experiencing unexpected or serious 
adverse events, or adverse events that lead to discontinuation.
As part of understanding the pharmacokinetics of the PD-0332991, blood samples may be 
used for metabolite identification and/or evaluation of the bioanalytical method.  These data will be used for internal exploratory purposes and will not be included in the Clinical Study Report.
Refer to the Study Manual for detailed collection, processing and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_4585]. 
7.4. Patient Reported Outcomes
Patient reported outcomes of h ealth-related quality of life and health status will be assessed 
using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-B) and EuroQol-5D 
(EQ-5D) instruments. 
The FACT-B and EQ-5D will be given to the patient in the appropriate language for the site.Patients will complete each instrument pre-dose on Day 1 of Cycle 1 through 3, then on 
Day 1 of every other subsequent cycles starting with Cycle 5 (eg, Cycles 5, 7, 9, etc), and then at the end of study treatment visit. After patients discontinuation from the active study treatment phase, FACT-B questionnaire will continue to be collected during the follow-up period every 6 months (+/- 7 days) from the last dose of investigational product until patient permanent discontinuation from study or end of follow-up period whichever occurs first.  Completed questionnaires are always considered source document and must be filedaccordingly.
Patients must complete these instruments in clinic (cannot be taken home) and prior to 
having any tests and to any discussion of their progress with healthcare personnel at the site.  Interviewer administration in clinic may be used under special circumstances (eg, patient forgot their glasses or feels too ill). Completion of FACT-B during the follow-up periodshould also be completed by [CONTACT_4675] a scheduled clinic visit whenever possible. However, if no clinic visits are being scheduled during that time interviewer administration via phone call may be used instead and documented accordingly in the patient source notes.

Page 867.4.1. EuroQol Health Utilities Index EQ-5D ( Appendix 5)
The EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) is a 6 item instrument designed to assess health status in terms of 
a single index value or utility score.  It consists of 5 descriptors of current health state (mobility, self care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression); a patient is asked to rate each state on a three level scale (1=no problem, 2=some problem, and 3=extreme problem) with higher levels indicating greater severity/impairment.  It also includes a visual analogue scale: the EQ VAS.  The EQ VAS records the patient’s self rated health on a scale from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state).  Published weights are available that allow for the creation of a single summary score.  Overall scores range from [ADDRESS_4279] (FACT-B) [Version 4]
(Appendix 6 )
The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT) is a modular approach to assess patient health-related quality of life using a ‘core’ set of questions (FACT-G) as well as a cancer site-specific module. 
The FACT-G is a 27-item compi[INVESTIGATOR_4586] 4 domains: Physical 
Well-Being, Social/Family Well-Being, Emotional Well-Being, and Functional Well-Being. 
The FACT-B consists of the FACT-G (27-items) and a breast-specific module: a 10-item 
instrument designed to assess patient concerns relating to breast cancer.  Patients are asked to respond to a likert scale where 0=not at all, 1=a little bit, 2=somewhat, 3=quite a bit, and 4=very much.
7.5. Biomarker Assessment
Tumor tissues are required from all patients for study participation. 
Retrospective confirmatory testing of tumor tissue samples for ER status will be performed 
in a central laboratory designated by [CONTACT_4682] a validated test.  Results from this testing will be used for sensitivity analyses and will not be made available to the sites. In addition, tumor tissue biomarkers, including DNA, RNA and protein analytes, will be analyzed to investigate possible associations with resistance/sensitivity to treatment with study drugs.  Biomarkers that will be analyzed will be selected based on their known relevance to mechanisms involved in cell cycle regulation.  Examples of such biomarkers include CCND1 and CDKN2A gene copy number, cdk4 and cdk6 RNA expression, and Ki67, pRb and p16 protein expression.
Submission of formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumor samples (blocks) of adequate 
size to allow for three 0.[ADDRESS_4280] be provided whenever 
possible.  If such tissue sample is unavailable, a de novo fresh biopsy is recommended when, 
in the investigator’s judgment, such biopsy is feasible and can be safely performed.  A sample of the original diagnostic tissue (ie, archival) will also be collected when available and sent to the sponsor-designated central laboratories for assessment of biomarkers associated with sensitivity and/or resistance to PD-0332991 (eg, Ki67, CDKN2A (p16), pRb).  Retrospective confirmation of ER status and HER2 status when needing to be repeated for eligibility purpose will be performed using the most recent tumor sample. Original diagnostic tumor tissue will be used for confirmation of ER and HER-2 status in the event that a recurrent/metastatic tissue sample is not available and a fresh biopsy of the recurrent/metastatic lesion is not feasible. 
Note
: Tissue sample collected after neoadjuvant treatment is not acceptable for eligibility 
purposes as the molecular characteristics of the sample may be different from the original 
diagnostic tissue sample. 
Tissue samples from all patients will be used for additional biomarker analyses.  Detailed 
information about biomarker sample collection, preparation, storage, labeling, and shipment is indicated in the Study Reference Manual.
7.5.1. Optional Tumor Tissue Biopsy for Molecular Profiling
An optional
fresh metastatic/recurrent tumor biopsy sample should be collected at the end of 
treatment visit for patients who discontinue treatment due to disease progression. The tumor 
tissue will be used to determine possible mechanisms of resistance to study treatment.
7.6. Retained Pharmacogenomic Sample(s)
7.6.1. Pharmacogenomics of Drug Response
Genomic and metabonomic variation may help to explain some of the variability in response 
seen with some drugs among different individuals.  This is referred to as pharmacogenomics.  Comparing the DNA, RNA, protein, and metabolite variation patterns of patients who respond well and those who respond poorly to treatment may help to better define the most appropriate group of patients in which to target a given treatment.  Collecting samples for pharmacogenomic analyses and retaining them in the [COMPANY_007] BioBank makes it possible to seek explanations for differences in, for example, exposure, efficacy, tolerability, or safety not anticipated prior to the beginning of the study. 
A single 4 mL blood sample (Prep D1; K
2edetic acid (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) 
(EDTA) whole blood collection optimized for DNA analysis) will be collected pre-dose at 
the Cycle 1 Day 1 to be retained for potential pharmacogenomic analyses related to drug 
response or adverse drug reactions.  For example, putative safety biomarkers, drug metabolizing enzyme genes, drug transport protein genes, or genes thought to be related to the mechanism of drug action may be examined.

prohibited by [CONTACT_427].  Detailed collection, processing, storage and shipment 
instructions are provided in the central laboratory manual. 
7.6.2. Additional Pharmacogenomic Research (Optional)
Unless prohibited by [CONTACT_427], patients will be asked to indicate on the consent form 
whether they will allow the Retained Pharmacogenomic Sample to also be used for the following research:
•Investigations of the disease under study in the clinical trial, and related conditions.
•Samples may be used as controls.  This includes use in case-control studies of 
diseases for which [COMPANY_007] is researching drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; use in characterizing the 
natural variation amongst people in genes, RNA, proteins, and metabolites; and use in developi[INVESTIGATOR_4587]. 
Patients need not provide additional samples for the uses described in Section 7.6.1 ; the 
samples specified in Section 7.6.[ADDRESS_4281](s) will be reported as described in the following sections. 
For all AEs, the investigator must pursue and obtain information adequate both to determine 
the outcome of the AE and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as aserious adverse event (SAE) requiring immediate notification to [COMPANY_007] or its designated representative.  For all AEs, sufficient information should be obtained by [CONTACT_4683].  The investigator is required to assess causality.  Follow-up by [CONTACT_4684] a level acceptable to the investigator, and [COMPANY_007] concurs with that assessment.
As part of ongoing safety reviews conducted by [CONTACT_456], any non-serious adverse event 
that is determined by [CONTACT_4685].  To assist in the determination of case seriousness further information may be requested from the investigator to provide clarity and understanding of the event in the context of the clinical study.

Page 898.2. Reporting Period
For SAEs, the active reporting period to [COMPANY_007] or its designated representative begins from 
the time that the patient provides informed consent, which is obtained prior to the patient’s participation in the study, ie, prior to undergoing any study-related procedure and/or receiving investigational product, through and including [ADDRESS_4282] after the active reporting period has ended should be reported to the sponsor if the investigator becomes aware of them; at a minimum, all SAEs that the investigator believes have at least a reasonable possibility of being related to investigational product are to be reported to the sponsor.
AEs (serious and non-serious) should be recorded on the Case Report Form (CRF) from the 
time the patient has taken at least one dose of investigational product through the patient’s last visit.
If a patient begins a new anti-cancer therapy, the AE reporting period for non-serious AEs 
ends at the time the new treatment is started.  Death must be reported if it occurs during the 
SAE reporting period after the last dose of investigational product, irrespective of any intervening treatment.
8.3. Definition of an Adverse Event
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation patient administered a 
product or medical device; the event need not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment or usage.  Examples of AEs include but are not limited to:  
•Abnormal test findings;
•Clinically significant symptoms and signs;
•Changes in physical examination findings;
•Hypersensitivity;
•Drug abuse;
•Drug dependency.
Additionally, they may include the signs or symptoms resulting from:
•Drug overdose;
•Drug withdrawal;
•Drug misuse;

•Extravasation;
•Exposure during pregnancy (EDP);
•Exposure via breast feeding;
•Medication error;
•Occupational exposure.
Worsening of signs and symptoms of the malignancy under study should be reported as AEs 
in the appropriate section of the CRF.  Disease progression assessed by [CONTACT_4686].
8.4. Abnormal Test Findings
The criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test finding should be reported as 
an AE are as follows: 
•Test result is associated with accompanying symptoms, and/or
•Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention, and/or
•Test result leads to a change in study dosing or discontinuation from the study, 
significant additional concomitant drug treatment, or other therapy, and/or
•Test result is considered to be an AE by [CONTACT_4687].
Merely repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of any of the above conditions, does not 
constitute an AE.  Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require reporting as an AE.
8.5. Serious Adverse Events
A Serious Adverse Event is any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that:
•Results in death;
•Is life-threatening (immediate risk of death);
•Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];

ability to conduct normal life functions);
•Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect.
Progression of the malignancy under study (including signs and symptoms of progression) 
should not be reported as an SAE unless the outcome is fatal within the safety reporting period.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4588].  If the malignancy has a fatal outcome during the study or within the safety reporting period, then the event leading to death must be recorded as an AE and as an SAE with CTCAE Grade 5 (see Section on Severity Assessment ).
Medical and scientific judgment is exercised in determining whether an event is an important medical event.  An important medical event may not be immediately life-threatening and/or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  However, if it is determined that the event may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the other AE outcomes, the important medical event should be reported as serious. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.
8.5.1. Protocol-Specified Serious Adverse Events
There are no protocol-specified SAEs in this study.  All SAEs will be reported by [CONTACT_4688], and will be handled as SAEs in the safety database (see Section on Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements ). 
8.5.2. Potential Cases of Drug-Induced Liver Injury
Abnormal values in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 
levels concurrent with abnormal elevations in total bilirubin level that meet the criteria outlined below in the absence of other causes of liver injury are considered potential cases of drug-induced liver injury (potential Hy’s Law cases) and should always be considered important medical events. 
The threshold of laboratory abnormalities for a potential case of drug-induced liver injury 
depends on the patient’s individual baseline values and underlying conditions.  Patients who present with the following laboratory abnormalities should be evaluated further to definitively determine the etiology of the abnormal laboratory values:
•Patients with AST or ALT and total bilirubin baseline values within the normal range 
who subsequently present with AST or ALT values ≥3 times the upper limit of 
normal (X ULN) concurrent with a total bilirubin value ≥[ADDRESS_4283] with no evidence 
of hemolysis and an alkaline phosphatase value ≤[ADDRESS_4284] or not available.

Concurrent with:•For patients with pre-existing values of total bilirubin above the normal range: 
Total bilirubin level increased from baseline by [CONTACT_4689] ≥3 times the upper limit of normal

The patient should return to the investigational site and be evaluated as soon as possible, 
preferably within 48 hours from awareness of the abnormal results.  This evaluation should include laboratory tests, detailed history, and physical assessment, and the possibility of hepatic neoplasia (primary or secondary) should be considered.  
In addition to repeating measurements of AST and ALT, laboratory tests should include 
albumin, creatine kinase, total bilirubin, direct and indirect bilirubin, gamma-glutamyl transferase, prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR), and alkaline phosphatase.  A detailed history, including relevant information, such as review of ethanol, acetaminophen, recreational drug and supplement consumption, family history, occupational exposure, sexual history, travel history, history of contact [CONTACT_4490] a jaundiced person, surgery, blood transfusion, history of liver or allergic disease, and work exposure, should be collected.  Further testing for acute hepatitis A, B, or C infection and liver imaging (eg, biliary tract) may be warranted. All cases confirmed on repeat testing as meeting the laboratory criteria defined above, with no other cause for liver function test (LFT) abnormalities identified at the time should be considered potential Hy’s Law cases irrespective of availability of all the results of the investigations performed to determine etiology of the abnormal LFTs.  Such potential Hy’s Law cases should be reported as SAEs.

Admission also includes transfer within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4591]/intensive care unit (eg, from the psychiatric wing to a medical floor, medical floor to a coronary care unit, or neurological floor to a tuberculosis unit).  An emergency room visit does not necessarily constitute a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; however, the event leading to the emergency room visit should be assessed for medical importance.

•Pre-planned treatments or surgical procedures. These should be noted in the baseline documentation for the entire protocol and/or for the individual patient.
•Admission exclusively for the administration of blood products.
Diagnostic and therapeutic non-invasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery, should not 
be reported as AEs.  However, the medical condition for which the procedure was performed should be reported if it meets the definition of an AE.  For example, an acute appendicitis that begins during the AE reporting period should be reported as the AE, and the resulting appendectomy should be recorded as treatment of the AE.

Page 948.7. Severity Assessment
As required on the AE CRFs, the investigator will report adverse events using concise 
medical terminology (verbatim) as well as collect on the CRF the appropriate Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) (version 4.0, Publish Date:May 28, 2009, http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html) and will use the following definitions of severity to describe the maximum intensity of the adverse event.
GRADE Clinical Description of Severity
0 No Change from Normal or Reference Range (This grade is not included in the 
Version 4.0 CTCAE document but may be used in certain circumstances.)
1 MILD Adverse Event
2 MODERATE Adverse Event
3 SEVERE Adverse Event
4 LIFE-THREATENING Consequences; Urgent Intervention Indicated
5 DEATH RELATED TO Adverse Event
Note the distinction between the severity and the seriousness of an AE.  A severe event is not 
necessarily an SAE.  For example, a headache may be severe (interferes significantly with the patient's usual function) but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of the criteria for SAEs, listed above.
8.8. Causality Assessment
The investigator’s assessment of causality must be provided for all AEs (serious and 
non-serious); the investigator must record the causal relationship in the CRF, as appropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the serious adverse reporting requirements if applicable.  An investigator’s causality assessment is the determination of whether there exists a reasonable possibility that the investigational product caused or contributed to an AE; generally the facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship should be provided.  If the investigator does not know whether or not the investigational product caused the event, then the event will be handled as “related to investigational product” for reporting purposes, as defined by [CONTACT_456] (see Section on Reporting Requirements ).  If the 
investigator's causality assessment is "unknown but not related to investigational product", this should be clearly documented on study records. 
In addition, if the investigator determines an SAE is associated with study procedures, the 
investigator must record this causal relationship in the source documents and CRF, as appropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the SAE reporting requirements, if applicable.

Page 958.9. Exposure During Pregnancy
For both unapproved/unlicensed products and for marketed products, an exposure during 
pregnancy occurs if:
1. A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or having been 
exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the investigational product; or the female becomes, or is found to be pregnant after discontinuing and/or being exposed to the investigational product; 
An example of environmental exposure would be a case involving direct contact [CONTACT_4490] 
a [COMPANY_007] product in a pregnant woman (eg, a nurse reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to chemotherapeutic products).
2. A male has been exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the 
investigational product prior to or around the time of conception and/or is exposed during his partner’s pregnancy.
If a study patient or study patient’s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the study patient’s treatment with the investigational product, the investigator must submit this information to the [COMPANY_007] Drug Safety Unit on an SAE Report Form and Exposure in Utero (EIU) Supplemental Form, regardless of whether an SAE has occurred.  In addition, the investigator must submit information regarding environmental exposure to a [COMPANY_007] product in a pregnant woman (eg, a patient reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to a cytotoxic product by [CONTACT_4691][INVESTIGATOR_4598]) using the EIU Form.  This must be done irrespective of whether an AE has occurred and within 24 hours of awareness of the exposure.  The information submitted should include the anticipated date of delivery (see below for information related to termination of pregnancy).
Follow-up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy and its outcome for 
all EIU reports with an unknown outcome.  The investigator will follow the pregnancy until completion (or until pregnancy termination) and notify [COMPANY_007] of the outcome as a follow up to the initial EIU Form.  In the case of a live birth, the structural integrity of the neonate can be assessed at the time of birth.  In the event of a termination, the reason(s) for termination should be specified and, if clinically possible, the structural integrity of the terminated fetus should be assessed by [CONTACT_4692] (unless pre-procedure test findings are conclusive for a congenital anomaly and the findings are reported).
If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy, 
spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly [in a live born baby, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise, or a neonatal death]), the investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs.
Additional information about pregnancy outcomes that are reported as SAEs follows: 
•Spontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and missed abortion;

Page 96•Neonatal deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_4287].
Additional information regarding the exposure during pregnancy may be requested by [CONTACT_093].  Further follow-up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case-by-case basis (eg, follow-up on preterm infants to identify developmental delays).  In the case of paternal exposure, the investigator will provide the study patient with the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to deliver to his partner.  The Investigator must document in the source documents that the patient was given the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to provide to his partner.
8.10. Occupational Exposure
An occupational exposure occurs when during the performance of job duties, a person 
(whether a healthcare professional or otherwise) gets in unplanned direct contact [CONTACT_4693], which may or may not lead to the occurrence of an adverse event.
An occupational exposure is reported to the drug safety unit within 24 hours of the
investigator’s awareness, using the SAE Report form, regardless of whether there is an associated AE/SAE.  Since the information does not pertain to a subject enrolled in the study, the information is not reported on a Case Report Form (CRF); however, a copy of the completed SAE Report form is maintained in the investigator site file.
8.11. Withdrawal Due to Adverse Events (See Also Section on Patient Withdrawal )
Withdrawal due to AEs should be distinguished from withdrawal due to other causes, 
according to the definition of AE noted earlier, and recorded on the appropriate AE CRF page.
When a patient withdraws because of an SAE, the SAE must be reported in accordance with 
the reporting requirements defined below.
8.12. Eliciting Adverse Event Information
The investigator is to report all directly observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously reported by 
[CONTACT_4694].  In addition, each study patient will be questioned about AEs.
8.13. Reporting Requirements
Each AE is to be assessed to determine if it meets the criteria for SAEs.  If an SAE occurs, 
expedited reporting will follow local and international regulations, as appropriate.
8.13.1. Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements
If an SAE occurs, [COMPANY_007] is to be notified within [ADDRESS_4288] be made immediately, irrespective of the extent of available AE information.  This timeframe  

PD-0332991
A5481008
Final Protocol Amendment 8, 21 May 2018
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 97also applies to additional new information (follow-up) on previously forwarded SAE reports 
as well as to the initial and follow-up reporting of exposure during pregnancy, exposure via breastfeeding and occupational exposure cases. 
In the rare event that the investigator does not become aware of the occurrence of an SAE 
immediately (eg, if an outpatient study patient initially seeks treatment elsewhere), the investigator is to report the event within 24 hours after learning of it and document the time of his/her first awareness of the AE.
For all SAEs, the investigator is obligated to pursue and provide information to [COMPANY_007] in 
accordance with the timeframes for reporting specified above.  In addition, an investigator may be requested by [CONTACT_4695]-up information in an expedited fashion.  This information collected for SAEs is more detailed than that captured on the AE CRF.  In general, this will include a description of the AE in sufficient detail to allow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independent determination of possible causality.  Information on other possible causes of the event, such as concomitant medications, vaccines, and/or illnesses must be provided.  In the case of a patient death, a summary of available autopsy findings must be submitted as soon as possible to [COMPANY_007] or its designated representative.
8.13.2. Non-Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements
All AEs will be reported on the AE page(s) of the CRF.  It should be noted that the form for 
collection of SAE information is not the same as the AE CRF.  Where the same data are collected, the forms must be completed in a consistent manner.  For example, the same AE term should be used on both forms.  AEs should be reported using concise medical terminology on the CRFs as well as on the form for collection of SAE information.
In addition to recording observed or volunteered adverse events, certain additional data will 
be solicited from the patients in this study to more fully characterize the clinical pharmacology of PD-0332991/placebo in combination with letrozole. These additional measurements are contained under Section 7.4 and include Patient Reported Outcomes.
Patient reported outcomes are collected and evaluated in a different manner than the observed or volunteered adverse events.  Given these differences, no attempt will be made to resolve any apparent discrepancies between observed or volunteered adverse events and the additional data collected from patients to more fully characterize the clinical pharmacology of PD-0332991/placebo in combination with letrozole. These additional data will be presented in separate tables, figures, and data listings, and will be reviewed in the final study report.  Adverse event incidence rates will not be calculated from these solicited data but rather from the information recorded on the Adverse Event pages on the Case Report Form (CRF).

9. DATA ANALYSIS/STATISTICAL METHODS
Detailed methodology for summary and statistical analyses of the data collected in this study 
will be documented in a Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), which will be dated and maintained by [CONTACT_456].  This document may modify the plans outlined in the protocol; however, any major modifications of the primary endpoint definition and/or its analysis will also be reflected in a protocol amendment.  The planned data analysis in this section was performed when this study met its primary endpoint at the final primary analysis performed with thedata cutoff date of 26 February 2016.  With the ongoing data collection of survivalinformation, the planned final OS analysis will be performed based on the detailed plan described in the SAP.  
9.1. Sample Size Determination
The primary purpose of this study is to demonstrate that the combination of 
PD-0332991 with letrozole is superior to placebo plus letrozole in prolonging PFS in postmenopausal women with ER (+), HER2 (-) ABC who have not received any prior systemic anti-cancer treatment for advanced disease.  The study is designed to test the null hypothesis that the true PFS distributions for both PD-0332991 plus letrozole and placebo plus letrozole arms are the same with a median PFS 9 months versus the alternative hypothesis that the true PFS distribution has a median that is longer than 9 months
4for the 
PD-0332991 plus letrozole arm. 
Under the original study design, 450 patients were to be enrolled using a 2:[ADDRESS_4289] 90% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.64. On [ADDRESS_4290] on efficacy results of potentially lower PD-0332991 exposures in some patients, an adjustment is now being made to the alternative hypothesis and an additional 200 patients will be enrolled into the study, and required number of PFS events for final analysis will be increased to 347. This will allow the trial to maintain a 90% power to detect significant treatment difference assuming a true hazard ratio of 0.[ADDRESS_4291]-line treatment setting is 9 months and a risk reduction by 31% (hazard ratio of 0.69) or an improvement by 44% to median PFS of 13 months in the PD-0332991 plus letrozole treatment is clinically significant.  A total of 347 events are required in the 2 arms of the study based on a 2:[ADDRESS_4292] 90% power to detect a difference assuming a true hazard ratio of 0.[ADDRESS_4293] at a significance level of 
0.025. Assuming a 15% drop-out rate on either treatment arm, a non-uniform accrual accomplished over a 15-month period and follow-up for about [ADDRESS_4294] patient is enrolled, a total sample size of approximately 650 patients (approximately 433 in the PD-0332991 plus letrozole arm and approximately 217 in the placebo plus letrozole arm) is required.
The sample size described above will also allow the assessment of differences in the 
secondary endpoint of overall survival (OS) with a high level of significance.  The OS outcome of a reported Phase 3 clinical trial in a similar patient population demonstrated a median of 34 months for the arm receiving letrozole.
4  Using this value as an assumption 
with a hypothesized 26% risk reduction (hazard ratio of 0.74) or 35% improvement in median OS (from 34 months to 46 months) in patients randomized to receive PD-[ADDRESS_4295] is required for a significance level of 0.025 and power of 80% to detect the difference.
9.2. Analysis Population
9.2.1. Intent-to-Treat Population (ITT)
The ITT population will include all patients who are randomized, with study drug assignment 
designated according to initial randomization.  The ITT population will be the primary population for evaluating all efficacy endpoints and patient characteristics.
9.2.2. As-Treated Population (AT)
The AT population will include all patients who receive at least 1 dose of study treatment (ie, 
PD-0332991/placebo or letrozole/placebo), with treatment assignments designated according to actual study treatment received. The AT population will be the primary population for evaluating treatment administration/compliance and safety.  Efficacy endpoints may be assessed in this population as well. 
9.3. Efficacy Analysis
All efficacy analyses will be based on intent-to-treat (ITT) population.  Some efficacy 
analyses will also be performed on the AT population.  All analyses will be performed by 
[CONTACT_4696]
®Version 9.1.3 or higher. 
All primary and secondary endpoints based on radiological (and photographical where
applicable) assessments of tumor burden (ie, PFS, OR, DR, DC) will be derived using the local radiologist’s/investigator’s assessment.  Radiographic images and clinical information collected on-study will also be reviewed by a blinded independent third-party core imaging laboratory to verify investigator reported tumor assessments.  This information will be used for supportive analyses. 

PD-[ADDRESS_4296] documentation of objective progression of disease (PD) or death due to any cause in the absence of documented PD, whichever occurs first.  PFS data will be censored on the date of the last tumor assessment on study for patients who do not have objective tumor progression and who do not die while on study. Patients lacking an evaluation of tumor response after randomization will have their PFS time censored on the date of randomization with a duration of [ADDRESS_4297] (one-sided) will be used to compare PFS time between the 2 treatment arms at the interim and/or final analyses with the overall significance level preserved at 0.025 (one-sided).  The stratification factor(s) are specified in Section 3 .  PFS time associated 
with each treatment arm will be summarized for the ITT population using the Kaplan-Meier method and displayed graphically where appropriate. Confidence intervals (CIs) for the 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles of the event-free time will be reported. The Cox Proportional hazards model will be fitted to compute the treatment hazard ratio and the corresponding 95% CI.
PFS will also be evaluated in the AT Population and the stratified long-rank test (one-sided, 
α=0.025) will be used. In addition, to assess the impact of proton-pump inhibitors and 
fasting condition, PFS will also be evaluated in the population excluding patients who took 
proton-pump inhibitors and/or any other antacid medications concomitantly with study drug under fasting conditions during the active treatment phase. 
9.3.2. Analysis of Secondary Endpoints
The secondary efficacy endpoints are:
Survival
Overall Survival (OS) is defined as the time from date of randomization to date of death due 
to any cause. In the absence of confirmation of death, survival time will be censored to last date the patient is known to be alive. 
All patients randomized will be considered evaluable for OS.  OS will be hierarchically 
tested for significance at the time of PFS analyses, provided the primary endpoint, PFS, is statistically significant at the PFS interim or final analyses.  A stratified log-rank test (using the same stratification factors as for the PFS analysis) will be used to compare OS between the treatment arms. OS for the two arms will be assessed using Kaplan-Meier methods and displayed graphically where appropriate. The median event times and 95% CIs will be estimated. Cox regression models will be used to estimate the treatment hazard ratio and its 95% confidence interval.

PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 101The 1-year survival probability will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and a two 
sided 95% CI for the log [-log(1 year survival probability)] will be calculated using a normal approximation using the Greenwood’s formula, and then back transformed to give a CI for the 1-year survival probability itself.  The 2-year, and 3-year survival probabilities will be estimated similarly. 
Objective Response (OR)
Objective response is defined as a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according 
to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST version 1.1; Appendix 7) 
recorded from randomization until disease progression or death due to any cause. 
A patient will be considered to have achieved an OR if the patient has a sustained complete 
response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to RECIST v.1.1 definitions. Otherwise, the patient will be considered as non-responders in the OR rate analysis.  Additionally, patients with inadequate data for tumor assessment (eg, no baseline assessment or no follow-up assessments) will be considered as non-responders in the OR rate analysis. 
The OR rate (ORR) on each randomized treatment arm will be estimated by [CONTACT_4697] (CR or PR) by [CONTACT_4698] (“response rate”). A 95% CI for the response rates will be provided.  Response rate comparisons between the 2 treatment arms as randomized will be assessed using Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test with the same stratification factors as for the PFS analysis. 
Analyses for ORR will be performed on the ITT population based on the investigator’s 
assessment as well and also on the review of the blinded independent third-party core imaging laboratory. 
In addition, the best overall response for each patient will be summarized by [CONTACT_2939].
Disease Control (DC)
Disease control (DC) is defined as complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable 
disease (SD) ≥[ADDRESS_4298] version 1.1( Appendix 7) recorded in the 
time period between randomization and disease progression or death to any cause. 
The DC rate (DCR) on each randomized treatment arm will be estimated by [CONTACT_4699], PR, or SD ≥24 weeks by [CONTACT_4700]. A 95% CI for the DC rates will be provided.  DC rate comparison 
between the two treatment arms as randomized will be assessed using CMH test with the same stratification factors as for the PFS analysis.
Analyses for DCR will be performed on the ITT population based on the investigator’s 
assessment as well and also on the review of the blinded independent third-party core imaging laboratory.

PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 102Duration of Response (DR)
Duration of response (DR) is defined as the time from the first documentation of objective 
tumor response (CR or PR) to the first documentation of objective tumor progression or to death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. DR data will be censored on the date of the last tumor assessment on study for patients who do not have objective tumor progression and who do not die due to any cause while on study. 
DR will only be calculated for the subgroup of patients with an objective response. DR for the two treatment arms will be summarized using Kaplan-Meier methods and 
displayed graphically, where appropriate. The median event time and 95% CI for the median will be provided for each endpoint.
All of these secondary analyses will be conducted at a one-sided 0.025 level of significance.  
Additional sensitivity analyses will be outlined in the SAP. 
Additional secondary endpoints include:
Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO)
Breast cancer-specific quality of life scores and change from baseline scores will be 
compared between the treatment arms at various time points using a mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) approach adjusting for specified covariates. In addition, analyses will be performed to determine if the change from baseline scores achieve the appropriate minimally important difference (MID) cut-off for the scale being examined. Patients from the ITTpopulation who completed a baseline assessment and at least one post-baseline assessment prior to study treatment discontinuation will be considered evaluable for the patient reported outcome analysis.
In addition to the above analyses, an examination of the time to deterioration (TTD) also will 
be carried out using survival analysis methods. A composite definition for deterioration based on death, tumor progression, and MID will be used.
Electrocardiogram (ECG) Analysis 
QT measurements corrected by [CONTACT_4701] (QTc) will be used for the data analysis and 
interpretation.  In addition to commonly used techniques including Bazett’s (QTcB) and Fridericia’s (QTcF) methods, a study-specific correction method will be evaluated (QTcS) for the ECG sub-group of Arm A. QTcF will be used for the primary analysis. 
The QTc analysis will be based on a non-inferiority hypothesis testing framework.  
Approximately 40 PD-0332991 plus letrozole treated patients are needed to establish non-inferiority (no unacceptable QTc prolongation from the PD-0332991 plus letrozole combination) between post-dose baseline and baseline ( ∆QTc) at all 5 QTc sampling time 
points on Cycle 1 Day 14 with 90% power.  The test is based on a one-sided difference in means t-test for paired ∆QTc with significance level of 0.05.  The difference in means  

PD-0332991
A5481008
Final Protocol Amendment 8, 21 May 2018
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 103between ∆ QTc under the alternative hypothesis is [ADDRESS_4299] deviation of the paired differences equals 16 msec (based 
on Study A5481003). If the upper bounds of one-sided 95% confidence intervals of ∆QTc
for all [ADDRESS_4300]-baseline dose QTc interval is considered to be “non-inferior” to the baseline; the QTc effect of PD-0332991 in combination with letrozole is concluded to not be unacceptable. 
Since this is a double-blind study with a 2:1 randomization, approximately 60 patients will be 
needed for QTc evaluation to ensure approximately 40 patients from the experimental arm (ie, PD-0332991 plus letrozole). 
Changes in QTc (QTcB, QTcF, and/or QTcS) from baseline will be summarized using 
descriptive statistics and categorical analysis by [CONTACT_4702]. A random effect model with the nominal time point as a fixed effect and the patients as a random effect will be used to estimate the mean change in QTc (QTcF, QTcS optional) from baseline at each post-baseline nominal time point.  The 90% confidence intervals for the changes from baseline in QTc will be provided at each post-baseline nominal time point.
Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Analysis of QTc
Concentration data of PD-0332991 will be listed by [CONTACT_4703]. 
Concentration-QTc analysis will be conducted usi ng the PK and ECG data from this study.  
Linear, log-linear, and/or saturable models will be examined for the concentration-QTc
relationship. Exploratory analyses (via graphical displays and/or model fitting) include accounting for a delayed effect and the justification for the choice of pharmacodynamic model.  Diagnostic evaluation will be included to explore the adequacy of the model.  Refer to SAP for details of the analysis.  The results of these modeling analyses may be reported separately from the clinical study report.
Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
Average trough concentrations will be listed by [CONTACT_4676]. Summary statistics will be provided 
for trough concentrations by [CONTACT_4704].  The relationship between trough concentration and potential covariates will be evaluated. All patients treated with PD-0332991 and for whom drug plasma concentration results (from 
at least 1 visit) are available will be included in the analysis. 
Exposure/Response Analysis 
In addition, the relationship between exposure and efficacy and safety endpoints will be 
explored, as necessary, based on emerging efficacy and safety data.  Refer to SAP for details of the analyses.  The results of these modeling analyses may be reported separately from the 
clinical study report.  

PD-[ADDRESS_4301] 
deviation, median, minimum, and maximum values, will be provided by [CONTACT_2939]. 
For baseline categorical data, the number and percentage of patients in each category will be 
provided by [CONTACT_2939]. 
Appropriate statistical methods may be used to investigate any possible relationship of 
biomarker levels with PD-0332991 plus letrozole anti-tumor efficacy.
9.4. Analysis of Other Endpoints
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize all patient characteristics, treatment 
administration/compliance, safety parameters, and biomarkers.  Data will also be displayedgraphically, where appropriate.
9.5. Safety Analysis
The AT population will be the primary population for safety evaluation.  Summaries of AEs 
and other safety parameters will be provided as appropriate.
Adverse Events
Adverse events will be classified using the medical dictionary for regulatory activities 
(MedDRA) classification system.  The severity of the toxicities will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE v4.0 whenever possible (http://ctep.info.nih.gov/reporting/ctc.html). 
Adverse events will be summarized by [CONTACT_4705]. Adverse events will be graded by [CONTACT_4706] v4.[ADDRESS_4302], the frequency of patients with values below, within, and above the normal ranges will be summarized by [CONTACT_3148].

Page 105Ocular Events
Ocular events will be reported as part of the adverse event analysis described above. 
Additionally, changes in lens grading while on study treatment will be analyzed as describedin the Statistical Analysis Plan.  
Summary and Categorical Electrocardiogram (ECG) Analysis 
All ECGs obtained during the study will be evaluated for safety.  The triplicate data will be 
averaged and all summary statistics and data presentations will use the triplicate averaged data.  Any data obtained from ECGs repeated for safety reasons after the nominal time-points will not be averaged along with the preceding triplicates. 
For all patients in the safety analysis population, individual change in QTc (QTcF, QTcB, 
QTc S) will be calculated for each nominal post-baseline time point. These individual changes will be summarized using descriptive statistics. 
For all patients in the safety analysis population, categorical analysis of the 
QTcF/QTcB/QTcS data will be conducted and summarized as follows: 
1. The number and percentage of patients with maximum increase from baseline in 
QTcF/QTcB/QTcS (<30, 30- 60, and ≥60 msec).
2. The number of and percentage patients with maximum post-dose QTcF/QTcB/QTcS
(<450, 450-<480, 480- <500, and >500 msec).
3. PR changes from baseline ≥50% if absolute baseline value was <200 msec, and 
≥25% if absolute baseline value was >200 msec. 
4. QRS changes from baseline ≥50% if absolute baseline value was <100 msec, and 
≥25% if absolute baseline value was >100 msec.
The analyses described above for all patients will be repeated separately for the ECGsub-population in group 1 for QTcF/QTcB/QTcS.
9.6. Interim Analysis
The study is designed to have one interim analysis and the final analysis based on the 
primary PFS endpoint.  A formal efficacy boundary (Haybittle-Peto) for rejecting the null hypothesis will be used for the interim analysis.  To protect the integrity of the study and to preserve the type-1 error rate, a fraction of alpha (0.000013) for efficacy will be spent at the interim analysis and accounted for in the overall type I error rate. The overall significance level for the efficacy analysis of PFS will be preserved at 0.025 (1-sided test). 

PD-[ADDRESS_4303] documented progressive disease or die (approximately 65% of the total events expected).  If 
the value of the test-statistic exceeds the Haybittle-Peto efficacy boundary (z ≥4.2059, p 
≤0.000013) the trial may be stopped for efficacy. Under exponential distribution assumption, 
this boundary equates to a hazard ratio of ~0.55 or smaller in favor of the palbociclib plus 
letrozole arm versus the letrozole alone arm.  Alternatively, as appropriate, the sample size of the study may be adjusted using the method outlined by [CONTACT_4628].
75  If the results of the 
interim analysis indicate serious safety concerns, the sponsor will communicate with the Health Authorities regarding stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_4557]. 
An interim analysis of efficacy is also planned for the secondary OS endpoint.  The analysis
will be performed at the time of the interim or final PFS analyses if the primary analysis for PFS is positive. The nominal significance levels for the interim and final analyses of OS will be determined by [CONTACT_4629]-DeMets procedure with an O’Brien-Fleming stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877]. 
The overall significance level for the efficacy analysis of OS will be preserved at 
0.025 (one-sided test).  Details of the analysis will be provided in the SAP. 
OS will be hierarchically tested for significance at the time of PFS analyses, provided the 
primary endpoint, PFS, is statistically significant at the interim and/or final PFS analyses.  If OS does not yield a significant result at these analyses, OS will be tested at the final OS analysis.  If PFS is not significant at the interim and/or final PFS analyses, OS will not be statistically evaluated. 
9.7. Data Monitoring Committees
The study will use an External Data Monitoring Committee (E-DMC).  The E-DMC 
membership and governance is outlined in a separate charter.
The E-DMC will be responsible for ongoing monitoring of the efficacy and safety data from 
patients in the study according to the Charter.  The E-DMC will make recommendation as towhether or not the trial should continue based on ongoing reviews of safety data.  In addition, the E-DMC will also evaluate interim efficacy data and make a recommendation regarding study continuation based on observed results of the study. The recommendations made by [CONTACT_941] E-DMC to alter the conduct of the study will be forwarded to [COMPANY_007] for final decision.  [COMPANY_007] will forward such decisions, which may include summaries of aggregate analyses of endpoint events and of safety data which are not endpoints, to regulatory authorities, as appropriate.  The sponsor will designate a biostatistician not affiliated with the project to prepare data for E-DMC review.  Only if action or consultation with Health Authorities is required will other sponsor staff be involved.  Clinical sites will be restricted from access to study results until the conclusion of the study.  

PD-[ADDRESS_4304] to ensure 
that the protocol and Good Clinical Practices (GCPs) are being followed.  The monitors may review source documents to confirm that the data recorded on CRFs is accurate.  The investigator and institution will allow [COMPANY_007] monitors/auditors or its agents and appropriate regulatory authorities direct access to source documents to perform this verification. This verification may also occur after study completion. 
During study conduct and/or after study completion, the study site may be subject to review 
by [CONTACT_4707] (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC), and/or to quality assurance audits performed by [CONTACT_4618], or companies working with or on behalf of [COMPANY_007], and/or to inspection by [CONTACT_4708].
The investigator(s) will notify [COMPANY_007] or its agents immediately of any regulatory inspection 
notification in relation to the study. Furthermore, the investigator will cooperate with [COMPANY_007] or its agents to prepare the study site for the inspection and will allow [COMPANY_007] or its agent, whenever feasible, to be present during the inspection. The investigator will promptly provide copi[INVESTIGATOR_4599].  Before response submission to the regulatory authorities, the investigator will provide [COMPANY_007] or its agents with an opportunity to review and comment on responses to any such findings.
It is important that the investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available during the 
monitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the process.
11. DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645] 
11.1. Case Report Forms/Electronic Data Record
As used in this protocol, the term CRF should be understood to refer to either a paper form 
or an electronic data record or both, depending on the data collection method used in this study.
A CRF is required and should be completed for each included patient.  The completed 
original CRFs are the sole property of [COMPANY_007] and should not be made available in any form to third parties, except for authorized representatives of [COMPANY_007] or appropriate regulatory authorities, without written permission from [COMPANY_007].
The investigator has ultimate responsibility for the collection and reporting of all clinical, 
safety and laboratory data entered on the CRFs and any other data collection forms (source documents) and ensuring that they are accurate, authentic/original, attributable, complete, consistent, legible, timely (contemporaneous), enduring and available when required.  The CRFs must be signed by [CONTACT_4709].  Any corrections to entries made in the CRFs, source documents must be dated, initialed and explained (if necessary) and should not obscure the original entry. 
In most cases, the source documents are the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]'s or the physician's patient chart.  In 
these cases data collected on the CRFs must match the data in those charts.

Final Protocol Amendment 8, 21 May 2018
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 108In some cases, the CRF, or part of the CRF, may also serve as source documents.  In these 
cases, a document should be available at the investigator’s site as well as at [COMPANY_007] and clearly identify those data that will be recorded in the CRF, and for which the CRF will stand as the source document.
11.2. Record Retention
To enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory authorities or [COMPANY_007] or its designated 
agents, the investigator agrees to keep records, including the identity of all participating patients (sufficient information to link records, eg, CRFs and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]), all original signed informed consent documents, copi[INVESTIGATOR_4600], safety reporting forms, source documents, and detailed records of treatment disposition, and adequate documentation of relevant correspondence (eg, letters, meeting minutes, telephone calls reports).  The records should be retained by [CONTACT_4710] (ICH), local regulations, or as specified in the Clinical Study Agreement (CSA), whichever is longer.
If the investigator becomes unable for any reason to continue to retain study records for the 
required period (eg, retirement, relocation), [COMPANY_007] should be prospectively notified.  The study records must be transferred to a designee acceptable to [COMPANY_007], such as another investigator, another institution, or to an independent third party arranged by [CONTACT_4618].  Investigator records must be kept for a minimum of [ADDRESS_4305] obtain [COMPANY_007]'s written permission before disposing of any records, 
even if retention requirements have been met.
12. ETHICS 
12.1. Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)
It is the responsibility of the investigator to have prospective approval of the study protocol, 
protocol amendments, informed consent documents, and other relevant documents, eg, recruitment advertisements, if applicable, from the IRB/IEC.  All correspondence with the IRB/IEC should be retained in the Investigator File.  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_1099]/IEC approvals should be forwarded to [COMPANY_007].
The only circumstance in which an amendment may be initiated prior to IRB/IEC approval is 
where the change is necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the patients.  In that event, the investigator must notify the IRB/IEC and [COMPANY_007] in writing immediately after the implementation.
12.2. Ethical Conduct of the Study
The study will be conducted in accordance with legal and regulatory requirements, as well as 
the general principles set forth in the International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research Involving Human Patients (Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences 2002), Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice (ICH 1996), and the Declaration of Helsinki (World Medical Association 1996 & 2008).  

PD-[ADDRESS_4306] be in compliance with ICH GCP, local regulatory 
requirements, and legal requirements.
The informed consent form(s) used during the informed consent process must be reviewed by 
[CONTACT_456], approved by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC, and available for inspection.
The investigator must ensure that each study patient, or his/her legal representative, is fully 
informed about the nature and objectives of the study and possible risks associated with participation.  The investigator, or a person designated by [CONTACT_093], will obtain written informed consent from each patient or the patient's legal representative before any study-specific activity is performed.  The investigator will retain the original of each patient's signed consent document.  The patient will be provided with a copy of the signed informed consent form(s).
12.4. Patient Recruitment
Advertisements approved by [CONTACT_4711].
12.5. Reporting of Safety Issues and Serious Breaches of the Protocol or ICH GCP
In the event of any prohibition or restriction imposed (ie, clinical hold) by [CONTACT_4712], or if the investigator is aware of any new information which might influence the evaluation of the benefits and risks of the investigational product, [COMPANY_007] should be informed immediately. 
In addition, the investigator will inform [COMPANY_007] immediately of any urgent safety measures 
taken by [CONTACT_4713], and of any serious breaches of this protocol or of ICH GCP that the investigator becomes aware of. 

PD-[ADDRESS_4307] been recruited and completed the study as stated in the regulatory application (ie, Clinical Trial Application (CTA)) and ethics application in the Member State.  Poor recruitment (recruiting less than the anticipated number in the CTA) by a Member State is not a reason for premature termination but is considered a normal conclusion to the study in that Member State.
13.2. End of Trial in all Participating Countries
End of Trial in all participating countries is defined as Last Patient Last Visit.
14. SPONSOR DISCONTINUATION CRITERIA
Premature termination of this study may occur because of a regulatory authority decision, 
change in opi[INVESTIGATOR_1100]/IEC, drug safety problems, or at the discretion of [COMPANY_007].  In addition, [COMPANY_007] retains the right to discontinue development of PD-[ADDRESS_4308] all participating patients and the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4601] (if applicable) within a week of notification.  As directed by [CONTACT_4618], all study materials must be collected and all CRFs completed to the greatest extent possible.

Revised RECIST guideline (version 1.1). European Journal of Cancer 45 (2009) 228–247.
CATEGORIZING LESIONS AT BASELINE
Measurable Lesions  
•Lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension.
•Lesions with longest diameter twice the slice thickness and at least [ADDRESS_4322] or MRI (slice thickness 5-8 mm).
•Lesions with longest diameter at least [ADDRESS_4323] X-ray.  
•Superficial lesions with longest diameter 10 mm or greater when assessed by [CONTACT_4733].
•Malignant lymph nodes with the short axis [ADDRESS_4324].
NOTE: The shortest axis is used as the diameter for malignant lymph nodes, longest axis for 
all other measurable lesions. 
Non-measurable disease 
Non-measurable disease includes lesions too small to be considered measurable (including 
nodes with short axis between 10 and 14.9 mm) and truly non-measurable disease such as pleural or pericardial effusions, ascites, inflammatory breast disease, leptomeningeal disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, clinical lesions that cannot be accurately measured with calipers, abdominal masses identified by [CONTACT_4734].
•Bone disease: Bone disease is non-measurable with the exception of soft tissue 
components that can be evaluated by [CONTACT_4735]. 
•Previous local treatment: A previously irradiated lesion (or lesion subjected to other 
local treatment) is non-measurable unless it has progressed since completion of 
treatment.
Normal sites
•Cystic lesions: Simple cysts should not be considered as malignant lesions and should 
not be recorded either as target or non-target disease.  Cystic lesions thought to 
represent cystic metastases can be measurable lesions, if they meet the specific definition above.  If non-cystic lesions are also present, these are preferred as target lesions.

Final Protocol Amendment 8, 21 May 2018
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 132•Normal nodes: Nodes with short axis <[ADDRESS_4325] be documented appropriately.  If baseline assessment is inadequate, subsequent statuses generally should be indeterminate. 
Target lesions
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ, 5 lesions in total, 
representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the basis of size (longest lesions) and suitability for accurate repeated measurements.  Record the longest diameter for each lesion, except in the case of pathological lymph nodes for which the short axis should be recorded.  The sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions at baseline will be the basis for comparison to assessments performed on study. 
•If two target lesions coalesce the measurement of the coalesced mass is used.  If a 
large target lesion splits, the sum of the parts is used.
•Measurements for target lesions that become small should continue to be recorded.  If a target lesion becomes too small to measure, [ADDRESS_4326] disappeared; otherwise a default value of 5 mm should be recorded.
NOTE: When nodal lesions decrease to <10 mm (normal), the actual measurement should still be recorded.
Non-target disease 
All non-measurable disease is non-target.  All measurable lesions not identified as target 
lesions are also included as non-target disease.  Measurements are not required but rather assessments will be expressed as ABSENT, INDETERMINATE, PRESENT/NOT INCREASED, INCREASED.  Multiple non-target lesions in one organ may be recorded as a single item on the case report form (eg, ‘multiple enlarged pelvic lymph nodes’ or ‘multiple liver metastases’).
OBJECTIVE RESPONSE STATUS AT EACH EVALUATION
Disease sites must be assessed using the same technique as baseline, including consistent 
administration of contrast and timing of scanning.  If a change needs to be made the case must be discussed with the radiologist to determine if substitution is possible.  If not, subsequent objective statuses are indeterminate.

Page 133Target disease
•Complete Response (CR): Complete disappearance of all target lesions with the 
exception of nodal disease.  All target nodes must decrease to normal size (short axis 
< 10 mm).  All target lesions must be assessed.
•Partial Response (PR): Greater than or equal to 30% decrease under baseline of the 
sum of diameters of all target measurable lesions.  The short diameter is used in the 
sum for target nodes, while the longest diameter is used in the sum for all other target lesions.  All target lesions must be assessed. 
•Stable: Does not qualify for CR, PR or Progression.  All target lesions must be 
assessed.  Stable can follow PR only in the rare case that the sum increases by [CONTACT_4736] 20% from the nadir, but enough that a previously documented 30% decrease no longer holds. 
•Objective Progression (PD): 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target measurable lesions above the smallest sum observed (over baseline if no decrease in the sum is observed during therapy), with a minimum absolute increase of 5 mm. 
•Indeterminate. Progression has not been documented, and 
•one or more target measurable lesions have not been assessed,
•or assessment methods used were inconsistent with those used at baseline,
•or one or more target lesions cannot be measured accurately (eg, poorly visible 
unless due to being too small to measure),
•or one or more target lesions were excised or irradiated and have not reappeared or increased. 
Non-target disease
•CR: Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker 
levels.  All lymph nodes must be ‘normal’ in size (<10 mm short axis).
•Non-CR/Non-PD: Persistence of any non-target lesions and/or tumor marker level above the normal limits. 
•PD: Unequivocal progression of pre-existing lesions.  Generally the overall tumor 
burden must increase sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy.  In the presence 
of SD or PR in target disease, progression due to unequivocal increase in non-target disease should be rare.

PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 134•Indeterminate: Progression has not been determined and one or more non-target sites 
were not assessed or assessment methods were inconsistent with those used at 
baseline.
New Lesions 
The appearance of any new unequivocal malignant lesion indicates PD.  If a new lesion is 
equivocal, for example due to its small size, continued assessment will clarify the etiology.  If repeat assessments confirm the lesion, then progression should be recorded on the date of the initial assessment.  A lesion identified in an area not previously scanned will be considered a new lesion.
Supplemental Investigations
•If CR determination depends on a residual lesion that decreased in size but did not 
disappear completely, it is recommended the residual lesion be investigated with 
biopsy or fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337].  If no disease is identified, objective status is CR.
•If progression determination depends on a lesion with an increase possibly due to 
necrosis, the lesion may be investigated with biopsy or fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_4609]. 
Subjective progression
Patients requiring discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of disease 
progression should not be reported as PD on tumor assessment CRFs.  This should be indicated on the end of treatment CRF as off treatment due to Global Deterioration of Health Status.  Every effort should be made to document objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment.

a.Active Treatment Phase: All assessments should be performed prior to dosing with study medications on 
the visit day unless otherwise indicated.  Acceptable time windows for performing each assessment are described in the column headers.  For the purposes of this trial 1 cycle is 28 days.  A cycle could be longer than 28 days if persistent toxicity delays the initiation of the subsequent cycle.
b.End of Treatment/Withdrawal: End of Treatment/Withdrawal evaluations will be performed as soon as 
possible but no later than 4 weeks (ie, 28 days) ±7days from last dose of study treatment and prior to the 
initiation of any new anti-cancer therapy. Obtain these assessments if not completed during the previous 
[ADDRESS_4330] Treatment Follow-up:   After discontinuation of study treatment, post-treatment follow-up 
information (ie, survival status, and post-study anti-cancer therapy details [including regimen number, 
name [CONTACT_4741], start/stop dates, and dates of disease progression on subsequent anti-cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]]) 
will be collected every 6 months (±7 days) from the last dose of study treatment.  Telephone contact [CONTACT_4737].  The follow-up period will conclude at the time of the final OS analysis.
d.Cycle X, Day 1: In the event that the start of a new cycle is delayed due to treatment related toxicity, 
procedures required on Day 1 of the given cycle will be performed when PD-0332991/placebo is resumed.  New cycle Day 1 procedures (ie, physical examination, ECOG performance status, ECG, Quality of Life questionnaires, blood chemistry, hematology) that were performed prior to knowing the need to delay the 
start of the cycle do not need to be repeated unless required to confirm that the parameters necessary for 
study drug to be resumed are met (see Section [IP_ADDRESS].2 ). 
e.Mandatory Tumor Tissue For Confirmatory Testing and for Biomarker Assessments: An optional
fresh tumor biopsy will be collected at the end of treatment visit, only for patients who discontinue treatment due to disease progression.  The tumor tissue will be used to determine possible mechanisms of resistance.  Tissue samples from all patients will be used for additional biomarker analyses.  Details on 
preparation of these samples including processing, storage, and shipment will be provided in the Study 
Manual.  
f.Physical Examination/Vital signs: Symptom-directed physical examinations, blood pressure and pulse 
rate will be performed.
g.Ophthalmic Examinations: Once Amendment #3 is IRB approved, all newly enrolled patients will 
undergo an ophthalmic examination at baseline, and on study treatment after 3 months (Cycle 4 Day 1), 6 months (Cycle 7 Day 1), 12 months (Cycle 13 Day 1), every 12 months (Day 1 of Cycles 25, 37 etc…) thereafter, and at the End of Treatment visit.  Additional ophthalmic examinations may be performed during the study as clinically indicated (including for patients randomized prior to Amendment 3 approval).  The ophthalmic examinations will include: best corrected distant visual acuity (Snellen), refractive error associated with best corrected distant visual acuity, intraocular pressure (IOP – one reading), slit lamp 
biomicroscopy of the anterior segment including cell count and flare grading, crystalline lens grading using 
the Wisconsin Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) [ADDRESS_4331].  Refer to Section 7.2.3.  Ocular Safety Assessments for further details on these procedures.
h.ECOG Performance Status : To be performed on Day 1 of every other cycle thereafter starting with 
Cycle 5 (ie, Cycle 5, 7, 9, etc), and at the end of treatment visit.
i.Hematology, and Blood Chemistry Panel: Hematology includes hemoglobin, WBC, absolute neutrophils, 
platelet count.  Blood chemistry includes AST/ALT, alkaline phosphatase, sodium, potassium, magnesium, total calcium, total bilirubin, BUN (or urea), serum creatinine, and albumin.  Upon IRB/IEC approval of Amendment 8 , blood chemistry will only need to be monitored every 3 cycles from the date of 
randomization (eg. C4D1, D7D1, C10D1, etc).  Also, for patients who experienced a maximum of Grade [ADDRESS_4332] 6 cycles, hematology for subsequent cycles may also be be monitored every 
3 cycles from the date of randomization, at the beginning (Day 1) of a cycle (eg, C4D1, C7D1, C10D1, etc). For patients who experienced a maximum of Grade [ADDRESS_4333] 6 cycles, hematology will continue to be assessed at the beginning (Day 1) of each cycle. Additional  unscheduled hematology and blood chemistry panels may be collected as clinically indicated and results will be recorded on the appropriate CRF. 
j.Hemoglobin A1c: Hemoglobin A1c will no longer be required to be measured every 3 months from the 
date of randomization (ie., C4D1, C7D1, etc...) but is required to be collected
at the end of treatment visit.
Additional unscheduled hemoglobin A1 may be collected as clinically indicated and results will be recorded on the appropriate CRF.

Final Protocol Amendment 8, 21 May 2018
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 143k.12-Lead ECG: ECGs beyond Cycle 10 will be performed as clinically indicated.  Refer to 
Pharmacokinetic and ECGs Schedule of Activities table for further details and timing of procedures.
l.Disease Assessments: Upon approval of Amendment 8 , tumor assessments may be performed at a different 
schedule than the original protocol if this is common practice at that institution or it is recommended by [CONTACT_4738]’s clinical conditions. Selection of imaging studies will depend on treating physician and radiologist as per local practice.  RECIST 1.1 may continue to be used to evaluate imaging assessments at the investigator’s discretion but will no longer be mandatory.  Assessments of tumor lesions [ie, target lesion(s), non-target lesion(s) and target lymph node(s)] will no longer be recorded in the CRF, nor will the RECIST assessments.  Only the date of progression of disease will be recorded.
m.Drug Compliance: PD-0332991, placebo and letrozole bottle(s)/blisters including any unused 
capsules/tablets will be returned to the clinic for drug accountability.  Drug accountability will be performed on Day 1 of every cycle prior to dispensing drug supply for the next cycle.
n.Adverse Events: For SAEs, the active reporting period begins from the time that the patient provides 
informed consent through and including [ADDRESS_4334].  Following the active safety reporting period, other SAEs of which the investigator becomes aware 
should be reported to [COMPANY_007], unless the SAE is attributed by [CONTACT_4739]-cancer therapy or to the patient’s participation in a subsequent clinical study.  AEs (serious and non serious) should be recorded on the CRF from the time the patient has taken at least one dose of study treatment through last patient visit.
o.Concomitant Medications/Treatments: Concomitant medications and treatments will be recorded from 
[ADDRESS_4335]-B Assessments: Patients will complete questionnaires prior to any study or medical 
procedure on Day 1 of Cycles 1, 2 and 3 and then Day 1 of every other cycle thereafter starting with Cycle 5 (ie, Cycle 5, 7, 9, etc), and at the end of treatment visit.  All self-assessment questionnaires must be completed by [CONTACT_4633].  Interviewer administration in clinic may be used under special circumstances.
q.FACT-B Assessments: After patients discontinue from the active treatment phase, FACT-B questionnaire 
will continue to be collected during the follow-up period every 6 months (+/- 7 days)  from the last dose of investigational product until patient permanent discontinuation from study or end of follow-up period whichever occurs first.  During the follow-up period, all self-assessment questionnaires should preferably be completed by [CONTACT_4675] a scheduled clinic visit.  However, if no clinic visits are being scheduled during the follow-up period interviewer administration via phone call may be used instead and 
documented accordingly in the patient source notes.
r.Letrozole (both treatment arms): To be taken orally, daily, and continuously.
s.PD-0332991 or Placebo: To be taken orally, daily from Day 1 to Day 21 (21 days) of every 28-day cycle 
followed by 7 days off treatment. In the event the Day 1 clinic visit of the subsequent cycle is scheduled 
during the -2 day allowable visit time window (ie, Day 27, Day 28), patients must be instructed to complete 
their 7-day off treatment period of the current cycle prior to resuming blinded therapy even if criteria for 
treatment resumptions are met at the visit. Cycle off treatment periods of less than 7 days are considered protocol deviations.

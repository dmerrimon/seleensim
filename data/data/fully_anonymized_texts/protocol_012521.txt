CONFIDENTIAL    Protocol Synopsis 
Title:  A Phase 2 /3 Multi -center Study of Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Blinatumomab in 
Subjects with Relapsed/Refractory Aggressive B -Cell Non Hodgkin Lymphoma  
Study Phase:  2/3 
Indication:  Aggressive B-Cell Non -Hodgkin Lymphoma  (B-NHL) 
Primary Objective:   
Phase 2: 
• To estimate the complete metabolic response (CMR) rate following blinatum omab 
monotherapy administered in the second salvage (S2) treatment of transplant -eligible 
subjects with relapsed or refractory (R/R) aggressive B -NHL who have not achieved CMR1 
following standard platinum -based first salvage (S1) chemotherapy  
Phase 3: • To compare the CMR rates following blinatumomab to those following investigator’s choice 
(IC) S2 chemotherapy  
Secondary Objectives:   
Phase 2: • To evaluate additional efficacy parameters following blinatumomab treatment, including:  
- Duration of response (DOR)  
- Progression- free survival  (PFS)  
- The rate of successful hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) mobilization  
• To evaluate the safety of blinatumomab in the S2 setting  
Phase 3: • To compare the efficacy of blinatumomab to IC chemotherapy with respect to:  
- Overall survival  (OS)  
- DOR  
- The rate of successful HSC  mobilization  
- Ability to proceed to hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) (both autologous and 
allogeneic) rates among responding subjects (CMR) or those in sustained partial 
metabolic response ( PMR) 
- Objective respons e rate (ORR; CMR  + PMR)  
- PFS 
• To compare the safety profile of blinatumomab to that of IC chemotherapy  
•  To compare the quality of life reported by [CONTACT_214876] 2 and  3 
• To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of blinatumomab administered to 
subjects with R/R aggressive B -NHL

CONFIDENTIAL    Exploratory Objectives:  
Phase s 2 and 3 : 
• To characterize the pharmacodynamic effects of blinatumomab administered in temporal 
proximity to various S1 regimens  
• To evaluate the response rate according to disease- specific features, such as 
cell-of-origin  (COO), c-myc and bcl-2 rearrangements  and over expression, Revised  
International Prognostic Index  (R-IPI), Secondary International Prognostic Index  (IPI), 
National Comprehensive Cancer Network International Prognostic Index  (NCCN IPI ), 
response to frontline therapy, duration of first remission 
• To evaluate the frequency of tumor -associated mutations in cell-free (CF) circulating  tumor  
DNA (CT-DNA)  among subjects at various time points during and after salvage treatment  
• To determine the incidence of anti -blinatumomab antibody formation 
Hypothesis (Phase 3) : Administration of blinatumomab to subjects with aggressive B -NHL 
following suboptimal response to standard plati num-containing S1 chemotherapy will increase the 
CMR rate  and overall survival.  
Primary Endpoint:   
Phase s 2 and 3 : 
• CMR as determined by [CONTACT_214877] -computed tomography  (PET/CT) scans using the Lugano Clas sification  
Secondary Endpoints :  
Key Secondary Endpoint:  
Phase 3: 
• OS 
Other Secondary Endpoints:  
Phase 2: • Objective response rate ( ORR ; including CMR  and PMR )  
• PFS 
• DOR  
• Successful mobilization rate (defined as CD34+  cell 2x10
6/kg) 
• HSCT (both autologous and allogeneic) rates among subjects  with post -blinatumomab 
complete response ( CMR ) + partial response ( PMR) 
• 100-day non -relapse mortality (NRM) after autologous HSCT  
• Blinatumomab concentration steady state, clearance, and half life 
• Incidence and severity of adverse events  
Phase 3: • ORR (including CMR  and PMR)  
• PFS

CONFIDENTIAL    • Blinatumomab steady state concentration and clearance  
• Overall incidence and severity of treatment -emergent adverse events 
Exploratory Endpoints ( Phase 2 and 3): 
• Pharmacodynamics, including descriptive analysis of quantitative and qualitative features of 
lymphocyte populations and serum or plasma concentrations of cytokines  
• Response rates and duration according to COO designation and c -myc and 
bcl-2 rearrangement  and over expression, R-IPI, Secondary IPI, NCCN IPI,  as determined 
from pretreatment specimens  
• Quantitative analysis of CF CT-DNA as determined by [CONTACT_214878] -associated mutations 
in CF CT -DNA  from plasma collected at various timepoints before, during, and after treatment  
Study Design:  This is a phase 2 /3 open label, multicenter trial testing blinatumomab 
monotherapy for the treatment of subjects with R/R aggressive B-NHL not achieving CMR after 
standard platinum -based chemotherapy regimens administered as S1.  This study incorporates 
multiple interim analyses for futility, efficacy, and unblinded sample -size re-estimation . In the 
phase [ADDRESS_258142] of up to a 28-day screening period, 
approximately 70 to 112 days of study treatment, a 30-day (± 3days ) safety follow up, and 
long- term follow up that will conclude with the final analysis of the phase [ADDRESS_258143] of up to a 28- day screening period, a treat ment 
period of up to approximately 168 days, a 30- day safety follow -up visit, and long -term follow up. 
Long -term follow up will conclude with the final analysis. 
In the phase 2 component, enrolled subjects will receive blinatumomab monotherapy.  In the 
phase 3 component, enrolled subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to blinatumomab or IC 
chemotherapy.  Randomization will be stratified according to the following criteria:  
• Response to S1 chemotherapy (PMR vs no metabolic response [ NMR ]/progressive 
metabolic disease [ PMD ]) 
• Cytarabine administered in S1 (eg, R-DHAP and R -ESHAP vs R -ICE and R -GDP)  
• Primary Mediastinal B -Cell Lymphoma (PMBCL) and B- cell lymphoma, unclassifiable, with 
features intermediate between DLBCL and classical Hodgkin lymphoma vs all other 
histologies of aggressive B -cell lymphoma  
All subjects enrolled  in phase 2 and s ubjects in phase 3 randomized to the blinatumomab arm will 
receive a single 70- day cycle, with a total of  56 days of blinatumomab continuous infusion (7 days 
at 9 µg/day, 7 days  at 28 µg/day, and 42 days at 112 µg/day ), followed by a treatment -free period 
of 14 days.  Response  will be assessed by [CONTACT_214879] a PET/ CT after this single cycle  (ie, 
on approximately day  70).  
In phase 3 , subjects randomized to the IC arm will receive no more than 3 cycles (maximum cycle 
length 28 days) of S2 chemotherapy prior to response assessment (see specific S2 requirements 
in Section  6.3).  Any change in the chemotherapy regimen prior to respon s e assessment or 
without objective evidence of disease progression will be scored as treatment failure.  
Following the response assessment, subjects may undergo hematopoietic stem and progenitor 
cell (HSC) mobilizatio n and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant  or allogeneic HSCT.  
Subjects who demonstrate a response (PMR or CMR) to protocol -assigned therapy  based on 
local assessment and who are not proceeding directly to autologous hematopoietic cell transplant  
or allogeneic HSCT may receive additional cycles of protocol -assigned therapy (maximum 
1 x 4- week cycle of blinatumomab given 7 days at 9 µg/day, 7 days at 28 µg/day, and 14 days at 
112 µg/day or a maximum of 3 cycles of IC S2 chemotherapy) starting at least [ADDRESS_258144]:  Blinatumomab

[ADDRESS_258149]  cycle  of blinatumomab is 70 days and includes 56 days of treatment,  followed by 
a 14- day treatment -free interval .  The initial blinatumomab dose is 9 µg/day, and is escalated 
stepwise to 28 µg/day on day 8 and then 112 µg/day on day 15 until the completion of therapy, 
barring any dose modifications . Responding subjects (PMR or CMR) not proceeding directly to 
autologous hematopoietic cell transplant  or allogeneic HSCT may receive a maximum of  
[ADDRESS_258150] 2 weeks, but  not more than 4 weeks , after the 
end of Cycle 1.  Optional Cycle 2 of blinatumomab is 4 weeks (28 days) in duration.  Cycle 2 dose 
escalation is 7 days at 9 µg/day, 7 days at 28 µg/day, and 14 days at 112 µg/day . 
Non-[COMPANY_010] Non-investigational Product Dosage and Administration: Subjects randomized 
to the IC arm will receive no more than 3 cycles (maximum cycle length 28 days) of 
S2 chemotherapy prior to response assessment (recommended S2 chemotherapy are provided 
in Sectio n 6.3). Subjects who demonstrate a response ( PMR  or CMR) to S2 chemotherapy based 
on local assessment and who are not proceeding directly to autologous hematopoietic cell 
transplant  or allogeneic HSCT may receive a maximum of 3 additional cycles of IC 
S2 chemotherapy.  
Procedures:  Written informed consent must be obtained from all subjects before any study 
specific screening procedures are performed. During the study, the following procedures will 
occur : medical history/current medical conditions, demographics, ECOG  Performance Status, 
physical exam including neurologic examination, height, weight, vital signs, radiographic 
assessment , and bone marrow biopsy  (select subjects) .  Subjects will provide samples  for 
coagulation, hematology with differential, blood chemistry profiles, urine sampling for pregnancy test, anti-blinatumomab  antibodies , and immunoglobin ( IgG, IgA, IgM ). Subjects will further

Statistical Considerations:  For phase [ADDRESS_258152] whether CMR/OS is superior in the group 
randomized to blinatumomab compared to the group randomized to IC.  The primary analysis 
(analysis 4) will be triggered by [CONTACT_214881] [ADDRESS_258153] 1 tumor assessment .  The final analysis (analysis 5) will test whether overall survival  is 
superior in the group randomized to blinatumomab compared to the group randomized to IC .  The 
final analysis will be triggered by [CONTACT_214882] 236th death from a phase [ADDRESS_258154] deviations and ranges, while categorical data will be summarized using frequency counts and percentages.  Graphical summaries of the data may also be 
presented.  
In phase 3,  an external independent data monitoring committee (DMC ) will oversee the interim 
analyses .  In addition, the DMC will assess safety approximately every 6 months provided 
enrollment is adequate.

2. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
2.1 Disease 
The annual incidence of Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (NHL) in Europe and the United 
States is estimated to be 15 to 20 cases/100.000  (Fisher and Fisher, 2004).  Diffuse 
large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)  is the most common subtype of NHL , accounting for 
30% to 40%  of cases and 13%  of all hematologic disorders.  The incidence i s 
approximately 8 cases per 100 000 and rises with age; the median age at diagnosis is 
70 years  (Haematological Malignancy Research Network ).  Morphologically similar 
entities  have historically been treated in a similar manner as DLBCL, and thus are 
collectively known as aggressive B -cell lymphomas.  DLBCL as a uniform 
diagnostic  entity, makes up approximately 85 % of aggressive B-cell lymphomas  
(Ziepert et al, 2010).  However, distinct patterns of gene expression are observed 
within DLBCL, with different prognostic and potentially predictive implications  
(Swerdlow et al, 2016).   
Left untreated, DLBCL is uniformly  fatal.  Anthracycline-based frontline chemotherapy, 
introduced in the 1970s, resulted in the long term cure of 30%  of patients  
(DeVita et al, 1975).Twenty -five years later, introduction of the human-mouse chimer ic 
monoclonal anti -CD20 immunoglobin G ( IgG) rituximab increased the cure rate 
significantly and is now a standard agent in frontline therapy, resulting in cure for 60 % of 
patients (Sehn and Gascoyne 2015).

CONFIDENTIAL    2.1.1 Primary Refractory or Relapsed Disease 
Patients with DLBCL who do not respond to frontline therapy, or who  experience 
relapse after a remission, are generally considered incurable unless able to receive high 
dose chemotherapy (HDT) plus either autologous HSCT  or allogeneic HSCT 
(Robinson et al, 2016).  HSCT is preceded by a course of salvage chemotherapy.  
“Chemoresponsivess”, indicating a partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) to 
salvage chemotherapy, has been as used as [ADDRESS_258182] eligibility, since 
early trials demonstrated the extremely poor outcomes of patients without an objective 
response to salvage chemotherapy  (Philip et al , 1987).  It is not known if responsiveness 
to newer classes of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], such as those that are immune-based, may also be 
sufficient to permit the successful use of HDT/HSCT . 
2.1.[ADDRESS_258183] commonly used regimens in the S1 treatment of transplant-eligibl e patients 
contain rituximab and a platinum -based agent such as cisplatin (eg, R-DHAP, R-GDP, 
R-ESHAP) or carboplatin (eg R -ICE)  (Crump et al , 2014; Martin et al , 2008; 
Witzig et al , 2008;  Kewalramani et al , 2004).  Each regimen is administered over  
4-5 days every 2-4 weeks .  Two to three cycles of therapy are given before response 
assessment .  Those with PR or CR typi[INVESTIGATOR_127371] H SC mobilization and an additional 
1-2 cycles may be given before HDT /HSCT .  Non-re sponders, if offered additional  
chemotherapy, typi[INVESTIGATOR_214856]. 
The efficacy of salvage regimens have been compared in 2 large, multicenter 
randomized trials, CORAL (R -DHAP vs R-ICE) and NCIC Ly.12 (R-DHAP vs R-GDP)  
(Crump et al , 2014; Gisselbrecht et al , 2010).  A third trial, ORCHARRD, tested an 
alternative anti -CD20 agent, ofatumomab, versus rituximab in combination with DHAP  
(van Imhoff et al , 2014).  An overview of the results is  shown in Table [ADDRESS_258184]-treatment assessments.  Nonetheless, these results 1) fail to demonstrate superiority of any specific regimen and 2) underscore the need for new agents in the 
salvage treatment of this disease.

relationship between CMR  (as defined by 18-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission 
tomography  [18FDG -PET] scanning) prior to HSCT and superior event-free survival  
(Armand et al , 2013; Derenzini et al , 2008; Dickinson et al , 2010; Roland et al , 2011; 
Sauter et al , 2015).  Pre-transplant 18FDG -PET outperformed other well establi shed 
prognostic factors, such as secondary age-adjusted international prognostic index  for 
outcomes after autologous HSCT  (Hamlin et al , 2003; Sauter et al , 2015 ).  Therefore, 
some centers will not mobilize patients with P MR or less after [ADDRESS_258188] cycle of the same salvage regimen may be used, though the efficacy is not documented and many non-responders discontinue after 2 cycles  (Martin et al , 2008 ). 
2.1.4 Later Salvage 
Patients who do not respond to S1 may be offered alternative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (hereafter 
referred to as S2) and HSCT provided that there is a response to S2 and that performance status and organ function are relatively preserved.  There is no standard

CONFIDENTIAL    S2 regimen for transplant eligible patients.  The ESMO and NCCN guidelines ar e 
relatively silent on appropriate S2 regimens  (Zelenetz et al , 2016; Tilly et al , 2015).  ICE, 
administered after DHAP, has been reported to provide a response rate of 
52%, including 14%  CR, but these responses have been observed almost exclusively in 
patients with stable disease (SD) rather than progressive disease ( PD) to 
DHAP (Simpson et al , 2007).  Results of other small, single- center retrospective analyses 
support the conclusion that standard cytotoxic therapy is of limited value in patients not 
responsive to S1 chemotherapy and that novel therapi[INVESTIGATOR_214857] (Elstrom et al , 2010; Ardeshna et al , 2005 ;).  
A recent report from the CORAL trial has provided outcome data on the [ADDRESS_258189]
 (prim arily due to treatment failure) after 
S1 chemotherapy ( Van Den Neste et al , 2016).  Eighty -two percent received additional 
chemotherapy at the discretion of the treating investigator.  Of those subjects, 
13%, 15%, and 67%  had CR/unconfirmed complete response ( CRu), PR, or SD/PD after 
S1, with the remainder having unknown response.  Approximately 20 % of those treated 
received R-DHAP -like regimens, 20%  received ICE -like regimen, and 14%  receiving a 
gemcitabine-based regimen.  A variety of other regimens made up the total, but each in fewer than 10%  of subjects.  
Among subjects achieving less than CR/CRu to second line therapy (n= 177), the CR/Cru 
rate to third line therapy was 22%.  The median OS  of the entire cohort (ie, including 
those that achieved CR/Cru to second line therapy) was 4.4 months.  For subjects 
achieving CR (n= 55), PR (n=24), or SD/PD (n =87), OS at 1 year 77, 44, and 13% , 
respectively .  Autologous HSCT
 was performed in 54, 58, and 22% of subjects with CR, 
PR, and SD/PD to S2 chemotherapy .  Thirty subjects  achieved CR and underwent 
HSCT; their 1 year survival was 82% .  These results confirm that the majority of patients 
who do not respond to S1 chemotherapy are unlikely to respond to additional 
conventional chemotherapy.  However, the survival experienced by [CONTACT_214885] , 
particularly those in CMR, support the objective to introduce new agents in this setting. 
2.[ADDRESS_258190] Background: Blinatumomab 
Blinatumomab (BLINCYTO, AMG 103, formerly also known as MT103 or 
bscCD19xCD3 ) is a member of a novel class of bispecific antibody constructs called 
BiTE, or “bispecific T-cell engagers” (Schlereth et al, 2006;  Dreier et al, 2002).  
Blinatumomab is a BiTE antibody construct with dual binding specificities.  T-cells are 
Approved

malignant cells with T-cells, thereby [CONTACT_48937] T- cell mediated killing of the bound 
malignant cell.  In preclinical models, blinatumomab-mediated T-cell activation involves the transient release of inflammatory cytokines and proliferation of T-cells .  The 
subsequent serial lysis of multiple malignant cells by a single blinatumomab-activated T-cell clos ely resembles a natural cytotoxic T-cell reaction.  
CD19 is highly expressed throughout B -cell development and is present on >  90% of 
B-cell lineage cancers including DLBCL.  The efficacy of blinatumomab has been 
evaluated in subjects with B -cell precursor  acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and NHL , 
including DLBCL.  
Study MT103-104 evaluated the efficacy of blinatumomab in subjects with 
relapsed/refractory B -NHL .  In this phase 1 study, subjects with relapsed/refractory NHL 
where treated with a target blinatumomab dose of 60µ g/m
2.  In the subset of subjects 
with DLBCL (n = 11), 2 achieved a PR and 4 achieved CR/unconfirmed complete 
response (CRu)  (ORR was 55% ).  Neurologic events were the dose limiting toxicity, but 
were reversible in all cases upon interruption of the infusion ( Goebeler  et al, 2016).  As 
of the most recent analysis, 2 of the DLBCL subjects with CR/CRu had ongoing 
responses beyond [ADDRESS_258192] and was censored, and the other relapsed around 7 months after therapy.  
A subsequent open-label phase 2 blinatumomab study (MT-103-208) in 
relapsed/refractory DLBCL included 25 subjects (23 subjects received stepwise dosing 
and 2 a flat dose of 112 µg/day).  At baseline, the median number of prior regimens was 
3 (range 1 to 7 ) and all subjects had received prior rituximab.  Seven (28% ) had relapsed 
after prior autologous HSCT. This study demonstrated stepwise dosing with weekly dose 
escalation of blinatumomab (9/28/112 µ g/day) was tolerable and associated with 
anti-tumor activity with an ORR after 1 cycle of blinatumomab of 43%  for evaluable 
subjects, including CR in 19%.  The most common adverse events were tremor, pyrexia, 
and fatigue.  Grade 3 neurologic adverse events were reported in 22%  of subjects (no 
grade 4 or 5) but were generally reversible with treatment interruption 
(Viardot et al, 2016) .

CONFIDENTIAL    The single agent clinical response seen in R/R DLBCL subjects suggests blinatumomab 
may be an effective therapy to improve the low PFS/OS that occurs in 
relapse/refractory  subjects  with present day therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] .  
Blinatumomab (BLINCYTO) is approved in multiple regions for the treatment of 
Philadelphia chromosome-negative R/R B-cell precursor ALL .  Additionally, confirmation 
of clinical benefit is a condition of approval in multiple countries .  
Refer to the specific section of the Investigator’s Brochure for additional information 
related to the physical, chemical, and pharmaceutical properties and formulation(s). 
2.3 Rationale 
This study in s ubjects with R/R  aggressive B -NHL  will provide an opportunity to further 
define blinatumomab’s safety and efficacy profile in this population.  The single-agent 
activity  of blinatumomab observed in heavily pre-treated subjects  as described above, 
coupled with  the need for new agents earlier in the course of salvage treatment, 
provides a strong rationale for testing blinatumomab in this setting.  
2.4 Clinical Hypotheses (Phase 3)  
Administration of blinatumomab to subjects with aggressive B -NHL following suboptimal 
response to standar d platinum -containing S1 chemotherapy will increase the CMR rate 
and OS. 
3. EXPERIMENTAL PLAN  
3.1 Study Design 
This is a phase 2 /3 open label, multicenter trial testing blinatumomab monotherapy for 
the treatment of subjects with R/R aggressive B-NHL not achieving CMR after standard 
platinum -based chemotherapy regimens administered as S1.  In the phase [ADDRESS_258193] 12 weeks after 
initiation of blinatumomab or  after initiationof IC chemotherapy  for phase 3 . 
Subjects with R/R aggressive B-NHL and considered by [CONTACT_214886], but dependent upon the response to S2, will be enrolled after  a minimum of 
[ADDRESS_258194] undergo a 
restaging positron emission tomography /computed tomography ( PET/CT ) that is

Protocol Number:  20150292  
Date:  [ADDRESS_258195] recruitment 
and retention, pre-screening discussions may be conducted with potential subjects prior 
to the initiation of S1 chemotherapy .  However, enrollm ent may not occur until the 
PET/CT results are centrally reviewed and interpreted. 
Subjects who experience clinical evidence of progression following at least [ADDRESS_258196]-S1 PET/CT scan to confirm progression and to establish a new baseline for 
subsequent response assessment.  
In the phase  2 component, enrolled subjects will receive blinatumomab monotherapy.  In 
the phase 3 component, enrolled subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 
blinatumomab or IC chemotherapy.  Randomization will be stratified according to the 
following criteria: 
Response to S1 chemotherapy (P MR vs no metabolic response [NMR ]/ progressive 
metabolic disease [PMD]) 
Cytarabine administered in S1 (eg, R -DHAP and R -ESHAP vs R -ICE and R -GDP)  
Primary Mediastinal B- Cell Lymphoma (PMBCL) and B-cell lymphoma, unclassifiable, 
with features intermediate between DLBCL and classical Hodgkin lymphoma vs all other 
histologies of aggressive B -cell lymphoma  
Subjects in the phase 2 and subjects randomized to blinatumomab in phase 3 will 
receive a single 70-day cycle, with a total of 56 days of blinatumomab continuous 
infusion of 7 days at 9 µ g/day, 7 days at 28 µg/day, and 42 days at 112 µg/days, 
followed by a treatment-free period of 14 days .  Response will be assessed by [CONTACT_214887] a PET/CT within 12 weeks of initiation of blinatumomab.  
In phase 3 , subjects randomized to the IC arm will receive no more than 3 cycles 
(maximum cycle length 28 days) of S2 chemotherapy prior to response assessment.

Product:  Blinatumomab  
Protocol Number:  20150292  
Date:  [ADDRESS_258218]’s legally acceptable representative must personally sign and 
date the IRB/IEC - and [COMPANY_010]-approved ICF before the commencement of study -specific 
procedures. Upon completion of the screening period the subject is evaluated by [CONTACT_214889]/exclusion criteria, 
the subject is subsequently eligible to be enrolled in the study and either randomized or assigned to a treatment regimen. 
For Phase [ADDRESS_258219] has met all eligibility criteria and a 
randomization number is provided via IVRS .  
Enrollment will occur after the centralized response assessment to S1 chemotherapy .  
Subjects with CMR (Deauville ≤  3) will not be enrolled.  The i nvestigator is to document 
this decision and date, in the subject’s medical record and in/on the enrollment case 
report form ( CRF). 
Each subject who enter s into the screening period (defined as the date when the subject 
signs the IRB/IEC -approved main study ICF ) for the study  receives a unique subject 
identification number before any study -related activities /procedures are performed.  The 
subject identification number will be assigned by [CONTACT_54537] .  This number will be used to 
identify the subject throughout the clinical study and must be used on all study 
documentation related to that subject .  
Subjects who fail screening will be allowed to re-screen once. 
The subject identification number must remain constant throughout the entire clinical 
study; it must not be changed after initial assignment, including if a subject is 
rescreened.  This number will not necessarily be the same as the randomization number 
assigned for the Phase 3 part of this  study.

CONFIDENTIAL    Subjects enrolled during the phase 3 component will be randomized to blinatumomab or 
IC chemotherapy  in a 1:[ADDRESS_258221].  The randomization call to the IVRS is accomplished by [CONTACT_214890].  The following information 
will be entered into IVRS for stratification:  
• Response to S1 (PMR vs NMR/PMD) 
• S1 chemotherapy (ie, Cytarabine [Ara-C] administered in S1 Yes/No)  
• PMBCL  and B-cell lymphoma, unclassifiable, with features intermediate between 
DLBCL and classical Hodgkin lymphoma vs all other histologies of aggressive 
B-cell lymphoma  
Once data have been entered into the IVRS a confirmation fax or email will be sent to 
the site to verify that the correct information has been entered.  The site representative 
will receive a single, unique randomization number for each phase [ADDRESS_258222]’s medical record and on the 
enrollment eCRF.  
Subjects should initiate their IVRS-assigned protocol required therapy within [ADDRESS_258223](s) and/or Medical Device(s)  
The [COMPANY_010] Investigational Product (IP) used in this study is  blinatumomab, and 
non-[COMPANY_010] non-IP  is IC chemotherapy.  
The Investigational Product Instruction Manual (IPIM), a document external to this protocol, contains detailed information regarding the storage, preparation, destruction, and administration of blinatumomab.  
Other protocol -mandated medication (eg, dexamethasone used for pre-dose treatment 
or for treatment of adverse events) are commercially available and are not provided or reimbursed by [CONTACT_11337] (except if required by [CONTACT_1295]).  The investigator will be responsible for obtaining supplies of these protocol -specified therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].

Protocol Number:  20150292  
Date:  [ADDRESS_258224]: Blinatumomab 
Blinatumomab will be manufactured and packaged by [CONTACT_214891]. 
Blinatumomab will be supplied as single-use glass injection vials as a sterile, 
preservative -free, white to off-white, lyophilized powder for reconstitution and 
admi nistration by [CONTACT_33980] ( IV) infusion.  Each  vial contains blinatumomab with 
additional excipi[INVESTIGATOR_214860], trehalose dihydrate, lysine hydrochloride and polysorbate 80, pH 7. 
To prepare blinatumomab for IV infusion, the lyophilized powder is reconstituted with 
sterile water for injection.  The reconstituted solution is added to an infusion bag 
containing 0.9%  NaCl and a product- specific stabilizer (IV Solution Stabilizer).  The 
IV solution stabilizer functions to prevent adsorption of blinatumomab to surfaces of the 
infusion components .  The IV Solution Stabilizer is supplied in a single -use glass 
injection vials as a sterile, preservative-free, clear, colorless -to-slightly -yellow liquid 
concentrate. 
Sterile water for  injection and supplies required for reconstitution and injection of 
blinatumomab will not be provided to clinical sites. 
For information surrounding the use of a continuous infusion pump, refer to Section 6.7. 
6.2.1 Dosage, Administration, and Schedule 
Blinatumomab will be administered by [CONTACT_100303] . 
A cycle of blinatumomab is 70 days and includes treatment 56 days of treatment, 
followed by a 14-day treatment-free interval.  The initial blinatumomab dose is 9 µ g/day, 
and is escalated stepwise to 28 µg/day on day 8 and then 112 µg /day on day 15 until 
the completion of therapy, barring any dose modifications .  Optional Cycle 
2 blinatumomab consists of a 28 day cycle of blinatumomab continuous infusion 
admini stered 7 days at 9 µg/day, 7 days at 28 µ g/day, and 14 days at 112 µg/day.  The 
dosing schedule is described in the study schema in Figure 1  for phase 2 and Figure 2  
for phase 3. 
The dose, start and stop date/time, and lot number of the protocol -specified therapy are 
to be recorded on each subject’s eCRF.  
Response should be assessed 14 (+ 3) days after completion of blinatumomab infusion. 
Chemotherapy should not be administered within the 14-day treatment-free interval

CONFIDENTIAL    unless clinical evidence of disease progression has occurred and therapy is indicated. 
Uniform adherence to that timeline is optimal for interpretation of results .  Subjects 
receiving additional chemotherapy prior to the response assessment will be scored as 
nonresponders .   
[IP_ADDRESS] Inpatient Dosing 
Subjects should be monitored in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34092] a minimum of 72 hours following initiation 
of therapy and for a minimum of 48 hours at each step-dose increase because of the potential adverse events associated with T-cell redistribution and potential cytokine release effects triggered by [CONTACT_214892].  Nurses/physicians 
trained in emergency medicine should be available for immediate intervention in case of 
complications .  See Section [IP_ADDRESS] regarding monitoring following dose interruptions . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Outpatient Dosing  
After a subject meets the minimum criteria for in patient administration and monitoring as 
described in  Section [IP_ADDRESS], and if a subject is deemed stable by [CONTACT_093], 
continuation of blinatumomab infusion may continue as an outpatient.  See 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] regarding monitoring following dose interruptions . 
In the outpatient setting, either the subject will return to the study center  for changes of 
infusion bags or the subject will be visited by a well -trained ambulant/home care service 
provider at specific intervals to change the infusion bag.  The subject and the 
ambulant/home care provider will be trained and will receive written instructions for 
storage of the IV bags.  
For the ambulant/home care provider , study -specific requirements and recording of 
source documentation must be completed before any study -related tasks are started.  A 
comprehensive list of all home care services, including but not limited to the storage, handling, and administration of blinatumomab as well as mandatory procedural and data 
collection requirements will be separately provided in a home health care manual.  Following each visit, this information will be documented on the ambulant/home care services visit worksheet and forwarded to the investigator.  
In case of any adverse event in the outpatient setting, the ambulant/home care provider 
should directly contact [CONTACT_214893].  Any 
unexpected or unusual events as well as any deviations will be communicated promptly to the investigator.  The ambulant/home c are professionals provide [ADDRESS_258225]:  Blinatumomab

Date:  [ADDRESS_258226] will visit the study center  for the examinations according to the 
Schedule of Assessments  (Table 5  to Table 9 ). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Overdose  
The effects of overdose of this product are not known.  The daily blinatumomab dose 
may be up to 10%  lower or higher in order to account for  possible pump inaccuracies.  A 
dose of up to 10%  higher than the intended dose may not require specific intervention.  
In case of overdose or medication error, the infusion should be immediately stopped.  
Consultation with the [COMPANY_010] medical monitor is strongly recommended for prompt 
reporting of clinically apparent or laboratory adverse events possibly related to overdosage.  Consultation with the [COMPANY_010] medical monitor is also strongly recommended even if there are no adverse events, in order to discuss the minimal duration of dose interruption.  If the overdose results in clinically apparent or 
symptomatic adverse events or additional adverse events, the subject should be 
followed carefully until all signs of toxicity are resolved and the adverse event/s should be recorded/reported per Section 9.  Resumption of blinatumomab should adhere to the 
guidelines in  Section 6.2.2. 
6.2.2 Dosage Adjustments, Delays, Rules for Withholding or Restarting, 
Permanent Discontinuation  
[IP_ADDRESS] Infusion Interruption Due to Technical/Logistical R easons 
The administration of blinatumomab should not be interrupted, if possible.  In case of infusion interruption due to any technical or logistic reason, the interruption should be as short as possible and the infusion continued at the earliest time pos sible.  Every 
interruption longer than [ADDRESS_258227]’s  eCRF . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Infusion Interruption/Dose Modifications d ue to Adverse Events 
Infusion interrupti ons and dose modifications of blinatumomab due to adverse events 
are detailed in Table 2 .  Infusions will be resumed according to instructions in Table 2  in 
order to complete the full treatment cycle, excluding the duration of treatment 
interruption (56 days blinatumomab in cycle 1, 28 days blinatumomab in optional

6.9 Excluded Treatments, Medical Devices, and/or Procedures During 
Screening and Treatment  Periods 
Subjects are prohibited from receiving the following therapi[INVESTIGATOR_214864] : 
• Any anti -tumor therapy other than protocol specified therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]:  
• Radiation therapy. Note that radiotherapy to previously bulky sites of disease that 
upon response assessment,  remains metabolically inactive (Deauville ≤  4) will not 
be counted as an event. Intrathecal chemotherapy may be administered if the 
investigator deems the subject to be at high risk of CNS relapse. Evidence of CNS disease will be reported as relapse or progression. 
• Immunotherapy  other than blinatumomab  
• Chronic systemic ( > 7 days) high-dose corticos teroid therapy (dexamethasone 
> 24 mg/day or  equivalent) 
• Any other immunosuppressive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (except for transient use of corticosteroids  
for ≤ 7 days ) 
• Any other investigational agent 
Following last response assessment and prior to trial enrollment, subjects are prohibited 
from receiving additional chemotherapy.  
The Exclusion Criteria in Section 4.1.[ADDRESS_258241] agree to practice true sexual abstinence 
(refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use an  effective method of contraception 
during treatment and for an additional [ADDRESS_258242] dose of protocol -required 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
Acceptable methods of effective contraception include: Hormonal ( combined estrogen 
and progestogen or progesterone-only hormonal contraception given via oral, 
intravaginal, transdermal, injectable, or implantable route); Intrauterine device;

CONFIDENTIAL    Intrauterine hormonal -releasing system ; bilateral tubal occlusion/ligation; vasectomized 
partner (provided that partner is the sole sexual partner of the female participant who is 
of childbearing potential and that the vasectomized partner has received medic al 
assessment of the surgical success) ; 2 barrier methods ( 1 by [CONTACT_99403]) and the 
female partner must use spermicide (if spermicide is commercially available) with the barrier method the male must use a condom (latex or other synthetic material) and the female may select either a diaphragm, cervical cap or contraceptive sponge. A female 
condom is not an option because there is a risk of tearing when both partners use a condom .  The reliability of true sexual abstinence must be evaluated by [CONTACT_214894].  
If a female subject is suspected of being pregnant, the protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_198038].  
Females not of childbearing potential are defined as: Any female who is has had a 
hysterectomy, OR bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656], OR bilateral oophorectomy, OR are 
post-menopausal . 
A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternativ e 
medical cause.  (A high follicle stimulating hormone [FSH] level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy [HRT].  However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient).  
Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the non-hormonal highly effective contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the study .  Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of 
postmenopausal status before study enrollment. 
Female subjects of childbearing potential must agree to practice sexual abstinence or 
use an acceptable method of effective contraception during the treatment and for an additional [ADDRESS_258243] dose of blinatumomab. 
Acceptable methods of contraception include:  
• Combined (estrogen and progestogen) or Progestogen-only hormonal methods 
given via oral, intravaginal, transdermal, injectable, or implantable route)  
• Intrauterine device  
• Intrauterine hormonal -releasing system

• Vasectomized partner (Provided that partner is the sole sexual partner of the 
female subject of childbearing potential and that the vasectomized partner has 
received medical assessment of the surgical success)  
• Sexual abstinence (Defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during 
the entire period of risk associated with the study treatments . The reliability of 
sexual abstinence must be evaluated in relation to the duration of the trial and 
the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject.)  
• Double barrier method: the male uses a condom and the female may choose 
either a cervical cap, diaphragm, or contraceptive sponge with spermicide (A female condom is not an option due to the risk of tearing when both partners 
use a condom.)  
Additional medications given during treatment with blinatumomab may alter the 
contraceptive requirements.  These additional medications may require female subjects  
use highly effective methods of contraception and for an increased length of time.  In addition, male subjects may also be required to use contraception.  The investigator is to discuss these contraceptive changes with the subject.  
6.10.[ADDRESS_258244] should let his  female partner know he is in the study.  
6.10.3 Unacceptable Methods of Birth Control for Female Subjects 
Birth control methods that are considered unacceptable in clinical trials include:  periodic 
abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods), withdrawal (coitus interruptus), spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhoea method.

CONFIDENTIAL    7.2 General Study Procedures  
The procedures performed and timing of each study visit are outlined in the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table 5  to Table 9 ). It is very important to attempt to perform study 
procedures and obtain samples at the precise timepoints stipulated in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 5  to Table 9 ).  When it is not possible to perform the study visit at 
the exact timepoint, the visit may be performed within the acceptable visit windows if applicable.  Any missed visits, tests not done, or examinations that are not conducted 
must be reported as such on the e CRFs .  Subsequent study visits should resume on the 
original schedule.  Missed assessments at prior visits should not be duplicated at 
subsequent visits.  
Details regarding each type of procedure are provided in subsequent sub -sections.  
Refer to the applicable supplemental central laboratory, IVRS, IPIM, and study manuals 
for detailed collection and handling procedures.  Refer to the eCRF completion 
guidelines for data collection requirements and documentation of study 
assessments/procedures. 
Confirmation that the most current IRB/IEC -approved ICF has been signed should occur 
before any study -specific procedures  are performed.  All subjects who are enrolled and 
receive blinatumomab or undergo study -specific procedures should be reconsented with 
any updated versions of IRB /IEC-approved ICFs during study participation as applicable 
and per institutional guidelines.  
7.2.1 Screening, Enrollment and/or Randomization  
The screening period is up to 28-days .  Screening procedures are to be completed 
during the screening period at time points designated in the Schedule of Assessments 
(Table 5 ).  Informed consent must be obtained before completing any study -specific 
procedures .  Procedures that are part of standard of care are not considered 
study -specific procedures and may be performed before the informed consent and used 
to determine eligibility  (as described in Section 4.1 ), but must be done within the 
timeframe as specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 5 ).  Randomization is 
described in Section 5.1.  
After written informed consent has been obtained, subjects will be screened to assess eligibility for study participation.  If a subject has not met all eligibility criteria at the end of the 28-day window, the subject will be registered as a screen failure.  Subjects who screen fail may be eligible to rescreen [ADDRESS_258265]:  Blinatumomab  
Protocol Number:  20150292  
Date:  [ADDRESS_258266] be performed within 28 days of day 1 (ie, 28 days of the 
start of treatment with study drug), unless otherwise noted.  Subjects who meet the 
inclusion and exclusion criteria will be eligible to be enrolled in the study.  See 
Section 6.[ADDRESS_258267] dose of blinatumomab or IC chemotherapy  on day 1 of the study . 
Visits and procedures will occur per the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 6 , Table 7 , and 
Table 8 ) during the treatment period. 
7.2.4 Safety Follow -up Visit (s) 
For phase 2 and phase 3 , all subjects , including subjects who withdraw from treatment 
early,  will complete a safety follow -up visit a pprox imately 30 (±  3) days  after their last 
dose of blinatumomab or 30 (±  3) days or after the last day of the last cycle of IC  
chemotherapy .  In the event that a planned cycle of therapy is delayed beyond [ADDRESS_258268] starts a new anti -lymphoma treatment within 30 (±  3) days of  their last dose 
of protocol -assigned therapy, a safety follow -up visit should be conducted immediately 
prior to starting any new treatment, including HSCT conditioning regimens . 
The procedures performed at the safety follow -up visit are listed in Table [ADDRESS_258269]:  Blinatumomab  
Protocol Number:  20150292  
Date:  [ADDRESS_258270] not undergone prior HSC mobilization, 
HSC mobilization may commence after PET/CT restaging.  Mobilization should be with colony stimulating factors (ie G-CSF or GM -CSF alone) and should not be preceded by 
[CONTACT_11553] (chemomobilization) or done in planned conjunction with another 
mobilizing agent, such as  plerixafor.  As an example, G -CSF may be administered at 
10 µg/kg/day for at least 5 days until the completion of apheresis.  The target cell dose is 
dictated by [CONTACT_141798], but should be no less than 2 x 10
6 CD34+ cells/kg .  
Failure to achieve that dose will be designated as not successful on the appropriate eCRF.  
For subjects randomized to IC S2 in phase 3 , the timing of mobilization is determined 
according to the S2 protocol chosen by [CONTACT_093].  Additional chemotherapy or planned plerixafor should not be used in the initial mobilization attempt. 
Leukapheresis may commence according to local standards .  If peripheral blood 
leukocyte and/or CD34+  cell counts are insufficient to initiate leukapheresis, subjects 
may receive plerixafor  in the initial mobilization or undergo other rescue mobil ization, 
including chemomobilization or bone marrow harvest.  Mobilization that requires 
plerixafor or additional chemotherapy will be designated as not successful on the appropriate eCRF.

7.2.9 Early Termination Visit  
Subjects (or a legally acceptable representative) can decline to continue receiving 
protocol -specified therapi[INVESTIGATOR_214866].  Reasons for removal of a subject from treatment or study are 
discussed in Section 8.3. 
If a subject discontinues protocol -specified therapi[INVESTIGATOR_21882], the Investigator is to 
discuss with the subject the appropriate processes for discontinuation from 
protocol -specified therapi[INVESTIGATOR_214867], including endpoints and adverse events.  The Investigator must document the change to the Schedule of 
Assessments (Table 5  to Table 9 ) and the level of follow -up that is agreed to by [CONTACT_1560] (eg, in person, by [CONTACT_756]/mail, through family/friends, in 
correspondence/communication with other physicians, and from  review of the medical 
records ).

At the screening timepoint, a diagnostic tumor specimen will be collected, and sections 
will be used to determine clonotypic sequences of rearranged antigen receptor genes  
and/or mutational status of specific genes.  Samples  of peripheral blood will be collected 
for plasma separation and freezing at timepoints indicated in the Schedule of 
Assessments.  Frozen plasma will be shipped to a central laboratory for high throughput sequencing. 
7.4.3 Serum Cytokines 
To monitor activation of immune effector  cells, blood samples for measurement of 
peripheral blood cytokine levels will be taken at the timepoints shown in Table 7  for all 
subjects in phase 2 and subjects randomized to blinatumomab in phase 3 .  The following 
cytokines will be assessed by [CONTACT_214897] ( CBA) technique: IL- 2, IL-6, IL-10, 
TNFα and IFNγ. 
7.4.4 Lymphocyte Subsets 
In subjects who receive blinatumomab to monitor changes in lymphocytes (B -cell and 
T-cell  populations ) and leukocyte populations (leukocytes, lymphocytes, monocytes, and 
granulocytes) in peripheral blood, samples will be collected before dexamethasone 
administration, after dexamethasone administration but before blinatumomab 
administration, and at additional timepoints as outlined in the Schedule of Assessments  
Table 6 .  The frequent sample collection during the treatment period will help to better 
understand the mechanism of action of the T-cell response. 7.4.5 Antibody Testing Procedures 
Blood samples will be collected at time points as outlined in the Schedule of 
Assessments for the measurement of anti -blinatumomab antibodies.  Samples testing 
positive for binding antibodies may be further characterized for quantity/titer, isotype, 
affinity, in-vitro neutralizing activity and presence of immune complexes.  Additional blood samples may be obtained to rule out anti -drug antibodies during the study.  
Subjects who test positive for binding antibodies and have clinical sequelae that are considered potentially related to an anti -blinatumomab antibody response may also be 
asked to return for additional follow up testing.

shipped to a central laboratory for high throughput sequencing.  These optional pharmacogenetic analyses focus on inherited genetic variations to evaluate their 
possible correlation to the disease and/or responsiveness to the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_214872] .  Genomic DNA will be isolated from non-malignant as well as tumor tissue in 
order to determine if genetic polymorphisms in the tumor sample are tumor -associated 
or germline mutations.  At present, there is no plan to perform targeted analysis of 
non-tumor associated genes in order to identify predictors of efficacy, toxicity, or to 
understand drug metabolism .  No additional samples will be collected for 
pharmacogenetic  studies .  
7.7 Sample Storage and Destruction 
Any blood sample collected according to the Schedule of Assess ments (Table 5  through 
Table 9 ) can be analyzed for any of the tests outlined in the protocol and for any tests 
necessary to minimize risks to study subjects.  This includes testing to ensure analytical 
methods produce reliable and valid data throughout the course of the study.  This can 
also include, but is not limited to, investigation of unexpected results, incurred sample 
reanalysis, and analyses for method transfer and comparability.

molecule (eg, mechanism of action/target, metabolites).  Results from this analysis are to be documented and maintained, but are not necessarily reported as part of this study.  Samples can be retained for up to [ADDRESS_258290]’s medical record and are not to be made available to the subject, members of the family, the personal physician, or other third parties, except as specified in the informed consent.  
The subject retains the right to request that the sample material be destroyed by 
[CONTACT_21947].  Following the request from the subject, the investigator is to provide the sponsor with the required study and subject number so that any remaining samples (eg, blood, tumor)  and any other components from the cells can be located and 
destroyed.  Samples will be destroyed once all protocol -defined procedures are 
completed.  However, information collected from samples prior to the request for destruction, will be retained by [CONTACT_11337]. 
The sponsor  is the exclusive owner of any data, discoveries, or derivative materials from 
the sample materials and is responsible for the destruction of the sample(s) at the 
request of the subject through the investigator, at the end of the storage period, or as 
appropriate (eg, the scientific rationale for experimentation with a certain sample type no longer justifies keepi[INVESTIGATOR_21878]).  If a commercial product is developed from this research project, the sponsor owns the commercial product.  The subject has no 
commercial rights to such product and has no commercial rights to the data, information,

Disease Related Events are events (serious or non-serious) anticipated to occur in the 
study population due to the underlying disease,  eg, disease progression.  Such events 
do not meet the definition of an adverse event unless assessed to be more severe than 
expected for the subject’s condition.  
Disease Related Events that do not qualify as Adverse Events or Serious Adverse 
Events:  
• An event which is part of the normal course of disease under study (eg, disease 
progression in oncology or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_44814]) is to be 
reported as a Disease Related Event.  
• Death due to the disease under study is to be recorded on the Event CRF.

CONFIDENTIAL  Disease Related Events that would qualify as  an Adverse Event or Serious Adverse 
Event: 
•An event based on the under
lying disease that is worse than expected as assessed
by [CONTACT_44910]’s condition or if the investigator believes there is a
causal relationship between the IP (s)/study treatment/protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_214873], this must be reported as an Adverse Event or Serious
Adverse Event.

9.1.[ADDRESS_258293]’s medical record.  
The definition of adverse events includes  worsening of a pre-existing medical condition.  
Worsening indicates that the pre-existing medical condition or underlying disease 
(eg, diabetes, migraine headaches, gout) has increased in severity, frequency, and/or 
duration more than would be expected, and/or has an association with a significantly 
worse outcome than expected.  A pre -existing condition that has not worsened more 
than anticipated (ie, more than usual fluctuation of disease) during the study or involves 
an intervention such as elective cosmetic surgery or a medical procedure while on study , 
is not considered an adverse event.  
If the severity of an adverse event changes from the date of onset to the date of resolution, record as a single event with the worst severity on the Event eCRF.

CONFIDENTIAL    For situations when an adverse event or serious adverse event is due to lymphoma  
report all known signs and symptoms.  D eath due to disease progression in the absence 
of signs and symptoms should be reported as the primary tumor type ( eg, R/R indolent 
NHL).  
Note:  The term “disease progression” should not be used to describe the disease 
related event or adverse event.  
An adverse device effect is any adverse event related to the use of a medical device.  
Adverse device effects include adverse events resulting from insufficient or inadequate 
instructions for use, adverse events resulting from any malfunction of the device, or adverse events resulting from use error or from intentional misuse of the device. 
The investigator’s clinica l judgment is used to determine whether a subject is to be 
removed from treatment due to an adverse event.  In the event a subject, or subject’s 
legally acceptable representative requests to withdraw from protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_33206], refer to Section 8.[ADDRESS_258294] 1 of the 
following serious criteria (unless it meets the definition of a Disease Related Event as 
defined in Section 9.1.1): 
• fatal 
• life threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death)  
• requires in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• other medically important serious event  
A disease related event blood and lymphatic system disorders or investigations are to be 
reported as a serious adverse event if: 
• the subject’s pre-existing condition becomes worse than what the investigator would 
consider typi[INVESTIGATOR_21885] a patient with the same underlying condition, or  
• if the investigator believes a causal relationship exists between the investigational 
medicinal product(s)/protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_75587],  
• and the event meets at least [ADDRESS_258295]:  Blinatumomab  
Protocol Number:  20150292  
Date:  07 May 2019 Page 76 of 115 
CONFIDENTIAL    An adverse event would meet the criterion of “requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]”,  if the event 
necessitated an admission to a health care facility (eg, overnight stay) .  
If an i nvestigator considers an event to be clinically important, but it does not meet any 
of the serious criteria, the event could be classified as a serious adverse event under the 
criterion of “other medically important serious event”.  Examples of such events could include allergic bronchospasm, convulsions, blood dyscrasias, DILI (see Appendix  A for 
drug-induced liver injury reporting criteria), or events that necessitate an emergency 
room visit, outpatient surgery, or urgent intervention. 
If the criteria for grade 4 in the CTCAE grading scale for laboratory event differs from 
the regulatory criteria for serious adverse events , it is left to the investigator ’s judgement 
whether to report these grade [ADDRESS_258296](s)/study treatment/protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_75588] -up visit are recorded on the Event CRF  as a Disease Related Event.  
Disease Related Events assessed by [CONTACT_44913]/or  related to the investigational medicinal product(s)/study 
treatment/protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and determined to be serious, must be recorded 
on the Event CRF as Serious Adverse Events .  
Additionally, the investigator is required to report a fatal Disease Related Event on the Event CRF.  
9.2.2 Adverse Events 
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting Procedures for Adverse Events That Do Not Meet Serious 
Criteria 
The i nvestigator is responsible for ensuring that all adverse events observed by [CONTACT_214900] -up visit are reported using the Even t CRF.  Adverse events considered by 
[CONTACT_214901]-ter m follow up until completion of a 
2-year period after treatment.

Date:  [ADDRESS_258297] assign the following adverse event attributes:  
• Adverse event diagnosis or syndrome(s), if known (if not known, signs or symptoms), 
• Dates of onset and resolution (if resolved), 
• Severity [and/or toxicity per protocol], 
• Assessment of relatedness to blinatumomab or protocol required medication or 
medical device, and  
• Action taken. 
The adverse event grading scale used will be the CTCAE .  The grading scale used in 
this study is described in Appendix A .  
The investigator must assess whether the adverse event is possibly related to 
blinatumomab.  This relationship is indicated by a “yes” or “no” response to the question: 
Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_155137]?  
The investigator must assess whether the adverse event is possibly related to any study -mandated activity (eg, protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]).  This relationship is indicated 
by a “yes” or “no” response to the question: “Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by a study activity (eg, protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]), and/or 
procedure”?   
The investigator is responsible for reviewing laboratory test results and determining whether an abnormal value in an individual study  subject represents a change from the 
subject’s baseline values.  All grade 3 and grade 4 laboratory values should be recorded 
as adverse events .  In addition, if signs  or symptoms are associated with a laboratory 
abnormality, the signs/symptoms and  the laboratory abnormality  should all  be recorded 
as adverse events.  The laboratory abnormality and any signs/symptoms should be 
graded according to their own CTCAE criteria. 
The Investigator is expected to follow reported a dverse events until stabilization or 
reversibility.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting Procedures for Serious Adverse Events 
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all serious adverse events observed by 
[CONTACT_214902] -up are recorded in the subject’s medical record and are 
submitted to [COMPANY_010].  In addition, blinatumomab related serious adverse events will be 
reported during the long term follow -up.  All serious adverse events must be submitted to 
[COMPANY_010] within 24 hours following the investigator’s knowledge of the event via the Event 
CRF.

CONFIDENTIAL    If the electronic data capture (EDC) system is unavailable to the site staff to report the 
serious adverse event, the information is to be reported to [COMPANY_010] via an electronic  
Serious Adverse Event Contingency Report Form within 24 hours of the investigator’s 
knowledge of the event.  See Appendix  B for a sample of the Serious Adverse Event 
Worksheet /electronic Serious Adverse Event Contingency Report Form .  For EDC 
studies  where the first notification of a Serious Adverse Event is reported to [COMPANY_010] via 
the eSerious Adverse Event Contingency Report Form, the data must be entered into 
the EDC system when the system is again available. 
The investigator must assess whether the serious adverse event is possibly related to 
blinatumomab and/or other protocol-required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] .  This relationship is indicated by 
a “yes” or “no” response to the question: Is there a reasonable possibility that the ev ent 
may have been caused by [CONTACT_33249] ? 
The investigator is expected to follow reported serious adverse events until stabilization 
or reversibility.  
New information relating to a previously reported serious adverse event must be 
submitted to [COMPANY_010].  All new information for serious adverse events must be sent to 
[COMPANY_010] within [ADDRESS_258298] be submitted to [COMPANY_010].  
[COMPANY_010] will report serious adverse events and/or suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions as required to regulatory authorities, investigators/institutions, and IRBs/IECs 
in compliance with all reporting requirements according to local regulations and GCP .  
The investigator is to notify the appropriate IRB/IEC of serious adverse events occurring 
at the site and other adverse event reports received from [COMPANY_010], in accordance with local regulatory r equirements and procedures . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting Serious Adverse Events After the Protocol-required 
Reporting Period 
There is no requirement to monitor study subjects for serious adverse events following 
the protocol -required reporting period or after end of study.  However, these serious

CONFIDENTIAL  adverse events can be reported to [COMPANY_010].  In some countries (eg, European Union 
member states), investigators are required to report serious adverse events that they become aware of after end of study.  If serious adverse events are reported, the 
investigator is to report them to [COMPANY_010] within 24 hours following the investigator’s 
knowledge of the event. 
In addition to the attributes listed in Section [IP_ADDRESS], the investigator must also complete 
the s erious adverse event  section of the Event eCRF.  
Serious adverse events reported outside of the protocol -required reporting period will be 
captured within the safety database as clinical trial cases for the purposes of expedited 
reporting.

will provide 90%  power to reject the null hypothesis that the response probability is no 
more than 15% .  Being able to make this determination will represent evidence of clinical 
activity and warrant advancement into the phase  3 part of the study. 
10.2.2 Phase 3 
The primary endpoint is CMR.  A CMR r ate of 22%  in the IC arm vs. 40 % in the 
blinatumomab arm is hypothesized.  The odds ratio of CMR rate will be tested at the 
1-sided significance level of 0.025. With these assumptions  and a 1:[ADDRESS_258308]:  Blinatumomab

for 3 interim futility analyses when 25%, 50% , and 75%  of the subjects have had the 
opportunity to complete the tumor assessment and 1 interim efficacy analysis when 
75% of the subjects have had the opportunity to complete the tumor assessment.  The 
interim futility boundaries will use a Lan-DeMets beta-spending approach to an 
O’Brien-Fleming boundary and the interim efficacy boundaries will use a Lan-DeMets 
alpha-spending approach to an O’Brien-Fleming boundary.  The details of these interim 
analyses are specified in the Section 10.4.1.  
Overall survival is a key secondary endpoint and the study is also powered for overall 
survival .  If the null hypothesis for the primary endpoint is rejected, then OS will also be 
tested at a [ADDRESS_258309] ratio is 0.65 a 
final OS analysis after 236 death events will provide 90% power.  With a median survival

Adverse Event Grading Scale 
The CTCAE  is available at the following location:  
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm  
Drug-induced Liver Injury Reporting & Additional Assessments  
Reporting 
To facilitate appropriate monitoring for signals of DILI, cases of concurrent AST or ALT 
and TBL and/or  INR elevation according to the criteria specified in Section 6.5 require 
the following: 
• The event is to be reported to [COMPANY_010] as a serious adverse event within 24 hours  of 
discovery or notification of the event (ie, before additional etiologic investigations 
have been concluded)  
• The appropriate e CRF (eg, Event CRF) that captures information necessary to 
facilitate the evaluation of treatment-emergent liver abnormalities is to be completed 
and sent to [COMPANY_010].  
Other events of hepatotoxicity and potential DILI are to be reported as serious adverse 
events if they meet the criteria for a serious adverse event defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
Additional Clinical Assessments and Observation 
All subjects in whom IP (s) or protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_33217]/are withheld (either 
permanently or conditionally) due to potential DILI as specified in Table [ADDRESS_258332] or ALT elevations >  [ADDRESS_258333] or 2-fold increases above baseline values 
for subjects with elevated values before drug are to undergo a period of “close 
observation” until abnormalities return to normal or to the subject’s baseline levels .  
Local laboratory assessments that are to be performed during this period include:  
• Repeat AST, ALT, ALP, bilirubin  (total and direct), and INR within 24 hours  
• In cases of TBL >  2x ULN or INR > 1.5, retesting of liver tests, BIL (total and direct), 
and INR  is to be performed every [ADDRESS_258334]:  Blinatumomab  
Protocol Number:  20150292  
Date:  07 May 2019 Page 103 of 115 
CONFIDENTIAL    Testing frequency of the above laboratory tests may decrease if the abnormalities 
stabilize or the IP (s) or protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_33218]/have been discontinued AND the 
subject is asymptomatic . 
• Initiate investigation of alternative causes for elevated AST or ALT and/or elevated 
TBL. The following are to be considered depending on the clinical situation: 
− Complete blood count (CBC) with differential to assess for e osinophilia  
− Serum total IgG, Anti-nuclear antibody ( ANA), Anti Smooth Muscle Antibody, and 
Liver Kidney Microsomal antibody 1 ( LKM1 ) to assess for autoimmune hepatitis  
− Serum acetaminophen (paracetamol) levels  
− A more detailed history of:  
• Prior and/or concurrent diseases or illness 
• Exposure to environmental and/or industrial chemical agents  
• Symptoms (if applicable) including right upper quadrant pain, hypersensitivity -type reactions, fatigue, nausea, vomiting and fever  
• Prior and/or concurrent use of alcohol, recreational drugs and special diets  
• Concomitant use of medications (including non-prescription medicines and 
herbal and dietary supplements), plants, and mushrooms  
− Viral serologies  
− CPK, haptoglobin, LDH, and peripheral blood smear  
− Appropriate liver imaging if clinically indicated  
• Appropriate blood sampling for PK analysis if this has not already been collected  
• Hepatology consult ( liver biopsy may be considered in consultation with an 
hepatologist)  
• Follow the subject and the laboratory tests (ALT, AST, TBL, INR) until all laboratory 
abnormalities return to baseline or normal  or considered stable by [CONTACT_093] . 
The “close observation period” is to continue for a minimum of 4 weeks after 
discontinuation of all IP(s) and protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
The potential DILI event and additional information such as medical history, concomitant 
medications and laboratory results must be captured in the corresponding eCRFs .

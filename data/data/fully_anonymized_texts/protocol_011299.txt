 FINAL: AMENDMENT 4 30 October  2019  - 8 - Design: This study is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, 
dose finding study of VERU-944 to treat hot flashes (vasomotor symptoms) in men with advanced prostate cancer on ADT. The study will be conducted as a staged study with Stage [ADDRESS_481659] completed Week 6 (Day 42) of dosing, an evaluation of the efficacy of the doses administered in Stage 1 will be made (safety will be assessed in a blinded review) and Stage 2, a two-arm evaluation of placebo and [ADDRESS_481660] three arms (placebo, 10 mg VERU-944, and 50 mg VERU-944) and Stage [ADDRESS_481661] two arms (placebo and 100 mg VERU-944) with 
approximately [ADDRESS_481662] advanced prostate cancer and will be undergoing androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with a luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) therapy (agonist or antagonist) for at least the three months prior to randomization and be experiencing regular moderate to severe hot flashes while on ADT.  Subjects w ill all continue to receive ADT and will 
be randomized to receive, for the first four days, a loading dose followed by [CONTACT_385068]-944 (10 mg, 50 mg or 100 mg) orally for a total period of 12 weeks.   
Subjects: Approximately, ninety ( 90) subjects will be randomized into Stage [ADDRESS_481663] 
experienced moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes) for at least one month prior to study entry will be enrolled.  Subjects must have been maintained on ADT with an LHRH agonist or antagonist for at least the 3 months prior to randomization will be screened for the study and if these subjects meet the other inclusion/exclusion criteria, will be randomized into the study.   
Treatments: Subjects will be maintained on ADT with an LHRH agonist or antagonist 
while on the study.  In addition to ADT, each subject will be orally administered either placebo, 10, or [ADDRESS_481664] completed a four 
day loading dose as outlined in Section 7.3.

 FINAL: AMENDMENT 4 30 October  2019  - 9 - Procedures: 
 Potential study participants will undergo a series of screening evaluations 
within 28 days prior to randomization.  Subjects who give written informed consent and satisfy the selection criteria will be enrolled into the study.   
The frequency and severity of hot flashes will be recorded daily beginning 
with screening and through week 12 (Day 84). Assessments of serum total 
and free testosterone, serum SHBG and serum PSA will be made at baseline (Day 1), Days 30, 60 and 84.  Bone turnover markers will be assessed at baseline (Day 1) and Day 84.   
Safety evaluations including assessment of adverse events, serum PSA, 
periodic monitoring of vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiogram (single) and 
clinical laboratory results (including hematology, serum chemistry (including LDH) will be conducted at every visit. 
Patients that have been previously screened for this study and could not 
complete screening for reasons other than not meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria, may be rescreened into the study. Laboratory testing conducted under this protocol (Appendix A) within 45 days prior to randomization into this study, may be used as the baseline laboratory values for this study and repeat laboratory testing is not required unless new coadministered medication(s) has been started, unless the investigator determines that retesting is warranted. 
Stage 2 
dosing 
evaluation: After the last subject has completed Day 42 of Stage 1, an unblinded 
assessment of the Week 6 (Day 42) hot flashes frequency (primary endpoint), hot flash severity (first secondary endpoint),and a blinded assessment of safety of VERU-944 will be conducted. 
If an effective dose of VERU-944 has been identified in Stage 1, Sponsor 
reserves the right to not initiate Stage 2 of this protocol. 
If an unacceptable safety profile is observed in Stage 1, Sponsor reserves 
the right to not initiate Stage 2 of this protocol.

 FINAL: AMENDMENT 4 30 October  2019  - 10 - 3.0 INTRODUCTION  
3.1 Background  
Veru Inc. is develop ing VERU -944 (cis-clomiphene ), a nonsteroidal estrogen , as a hormonal 
therapy for the alleviation of vasomotor symptoms, commonly known as hot flashes in men 
undergoing ADT. Cis -clomiphene is one of two geometric isomers of clomiphene, which is 
approved as Clomid® (clomiphene citrate oral capsules , 50 mg; NDA  016131; [COMPANY_011] Aventis 
US) for the treatment of ovulatory dysfunction in women desiring pregnancy. While trans -
clomiphene is anti -estrogenic, cis -clomiphene is an estrogen agonist at pharmacologic 
concentrations (Turner et al., 1998;  Fitzpatrick et al., 1 999; Kaminets ky et al., 2013 ). 
Furthermore, cis -clomiphene has a half -life of 5±7 days (Mikkelson et al., 1986; Mür dter et 
al., 2012 ). VERU -944 is expected to be effective and safe in men with prostate cancer 
undergoing ADT  based on the established efficac y of low dose  estrogens  in the treatment of  
vasomotor symptoms  (hot flashes ) and safety of off-label clomiphene use for male infertility . 
3.[ADDRESS_481665] common cancer in men with over 160 ,000 new cases expected  in 
2017  (American Cancer Society. Cancer Facts & Figures 2017 ).  As advanced prostate cancer 
is hormone sensitive, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the standard of c are for patients 
with metastatic or locally advanced prostate cancer, either alone or in combination with other 
drug treatments or radiation (National Comprehensive Cancer Network, 2016). The main 
objective of ADT is to lower the serum testosterone level t o castrate level of approximately 
1.7 nmol/L (< 50 ng/dL) (Djavan et al., 2012) . ADT is usually achieved either by [CONTACT_385069] (castration) or by [CONTACT_385070] (luteinizing hormone  releasing 
hormone) agonists and antagonists.   
One o f the main side effects of low testosterone levels in  men is vasomotor symptoms, 
commonly known as  hot flashes.  Hot flashes are experienced by [CONTACT_2902] 75% of men receiving 
ADT  (Holzbeierlein et al., 2004 ) aQd aUe a VigQificaQW cRmSRQeQW iQ meQ¶V perceptio n of their 
quality of life (Holzbeierlein et al., 2004 ).  One study found 38% of men who had experienced 
hot flashes over the past four wee ks were distressed about them (Holzbeierlein et al., 2004 ).  
These hot flashes can have a long duration.  Fo r example , in men experiencing hot flashes 
while on ADT, 70% of them continued to experience them five years later ( Karling 1994).  
Men describe their experience of hot flashes with physical as well as emotional descriptors 
(Isbarn et al., 2008 ).  Up to 80% of  men have described hot flashes that range from mild to 
very severe, lasting up to 30 minutes and accompanied by [CONTACT_385071], irritability and 
being out of control.  (Schow 1998 ). Hot flashes for men, as for women, often require some 
sort of act ion such as changing clothes or ta king a shower ( Isbarn et al., 2008 ). Hot flashes in 
men who have advanced prostate cancer being treated by [CONTACT_385072] -related distress caused by [CONTACT_385073] e a contributing 
factor in the discontinuation of ADT ( Engstrom, 2008; Ulloa et al., 2009; Frisk, 2010).

 FINAL: AMENDMENT [ADDRESS_481666] shown that abrupt 
withdrawal of sex hormones leads to a dysfunctional hypothalamic thermoregulation resulting 
in vasomotor flushing (Kaplan and Mahon, 2014 ). In wom en, hormones (usually estrogen 
combined with progesterone), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin -
noradrenalin reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), clonidine, and gabapentin have been effect ive in 
treating hot flashes. Similar treatments ha ve been attempted in men with inconsistent activity ; 
overall, hormonal treatments (cyproterone and medroxyprogesterone) are generally thought to 
be more effective than non -hormonal treatments at reducing hot flashes in men on ADT 
(Loprinzi  et al., 1994; Frisk, 2010; Irani et al., 2010; Vitolins et al., 2013) . Hot flashes in men 
on ADT are typi[INVESTIGATOR_385054] -label treatments such as  an SSRI, whereas  hormones such 
as estrogen and megestrol are reserved for refractory cases (Smith and Cr awford, 2017) . 
Hot Flash Treatment for Men  
There are no approved therapi[INVESTIGATOR_385055] T. There have been few placebo controlled, 
multicenter studies evaluating possib le drug interventions for hot flashes these  men. 
Megestrol acetate, 2 0 mg twice a day (Loprinzi et al., 1994 ), depo medroxyprogesterone 400 
mg IM (Brosman S 1995 ), and venlafaxine 12.5 mg twice a day  has been investigated as a 
tool to address hot flashes in  men (Loprinzi et al., 1999 ).  A very small randomized trial was 
completed with 12 men after orchiectomy with cyproterone acetate (100 mg three times a 
day) which a ppeared to reduce hot flashes (Eaton and McGuire, 1993 ).  In  addition to 
hormonal approaches , in women, the norepi[INVESTIGATOR_26331], venlafaxine , has been 
studied and shown to be  an effective non -horm onal treatment for hot flashes ( Evans et al., 
2005 ) although there is no  evidence that this approach will work in men .  
Another drug that has received some pi[INVESTIGATOR_48124] , specifically in men , is sertraline as reporte d 
in a series of case studies (Roth and Scher 1997 ).  Five men who were being treated with 
androgen ablation therapy for prostate cancer exhibited symptoms of hot flashes, s ymptom 
distress, trouble sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], worsening mood, fatigue and illness concerns.  Patients were treated 
with sertraline, starting with [ADDRESS_481667] 50 mg daily and side effects were experienced at a dose of 150 mg daily.  Specific 
reductions in hot flashes were not provided for every case, but one man experienced a 75 % 
reduction in hot flashes while ano ther experienced a 50% reduction.  In addition to hot flash 
reduction, the author reports improve ment in mood and irritability (Roth and Scher 1997 ).  
Doses from 50 mg to 100 mg appeared to be tolerated very well in this small group of cases.  
Gabapentin  for the treatment of hot flashes  
To date, there has only been one  placebo -controlled, Phase 3 study of a n agent to control hot 
flashes in men with prostate cancer on ADT.  This study, albeit non -regulatory, investigated 
the anti -seizure medic ation, gabapenti n. In this trial , men with bothersome hot flashes as 
Veru Inc  CONFIDENT IAL 
Protocol V72203  – FINAL Version 9.0 
 FINAL: AMENDMENT [ADDRESS_481668] gabapentin dose arm (900 mg/day)  demonstrated a significant 
decrease in hot flash frequency (p=0.02) and a trend towards lower scores (p=0.10) ( Loprinzi 
2009 ).  In a continuation phase of this study, those effects were maintained (Moraska et al., 
2007 ). Although these results were promis ing, gabapentin is not widely used for the treatment 
of hot flashes in this male population and the unmet medical need remains.  
 
Estrogens for the treatment of hot flashes in men with advanced prostate cancer on ADT  
 
As stated briefly above, vasomotor sympto ms (hot flashes) occur in a majority of men 
receiving ADT for advanced pros tate cancer.  Since decreasing estrogen levels as a result of 
the ADT are  a contributing  cause of the hot flashes, the off -label use of estrogenic compounds 
have  historically been used.  For example, low doses of diethylstilbestrol (0.25 mg/day) 
appears to have efficacy but can result in significant breast swelling and tenderness along with 
an increase in cardiovascular side effects  (Smith JA 1994; Smith J A 1996 ; Glashan 1981 ).  
Transdermal estrogen patches are another route of off -label administration of estrogens for 
this indication.  In a study of twelve men with moderate to severe hot flashes who were 
randomized to receive either low dose (0.05 mg) of high dose  (0.10  mg) estrogen twice 
weekly for four weeks.  Although no placebo group was included in this study, a significant 
reduction in the severity and frequency of hot flashes was observed in the high dose arm and 
in severity only in the low dose arm ( Gerber  2000 ).   
 
In conclusion , while  the off-label use of estrogens appear s to have benefit for the treatment of 
hot flashes in men with advanced prostate cancer , the type of most efficacious estrogen or 
estrogen preparation as well as dosing route or schedule i s not known. Furthermore, the 
potential for safety issues with potent steroidal estrogens remains a significant limitation to 
their clinical utility.  These published data support the evaluation of VERU -944 to determine 
the optimal dose for efficacy and sa fety of a nonsteroidal estrogen to treat hot flashes in men 
with advanced prostate cancer on ADT.  
3.3 Study Rationale  
Veru is evaluating cis-clomiphene  (zuclomiphene) , a nonsteriodal estrogen,  as a horm onal 
therapy for the amelioration  of hot flashes in men undergoing ADT  for advanced prostate 
cancer . Cis-clomiphene is one of two geometric isomers of clomiphene, which is approved as 
Clomid® (clomiphene citrate oral tablets, 50 mg; NDA 016131; [COMPANY_011] Aventis US) for the 
treatment of ovul atory dysfunction in women desiring pregnancy. While trans -clomiphene is 
anti-estrogenic, cis -clomiphene is an estrogen agonist at pharmacologic concentrations 
(Turner et al., 1998; Fitzpatrick et al., 1999; Kaminetsky et al., 2013;  Section [IP_ADDRESS]). 
Furth ermore, cis -clomiphene has a half -life of 5±7 days (Mikkelson et al., 1986; Mürdter et 
al., 2012). VERU -944 is expected to be effective and safe in men with prostate cancer 
undergoing ADT based on the established efficacy of low dose  estrogens in the treat ment of 
vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes) and safety of off -label clomiphene use for male infertility.

Veru Inc  CONFIDENT IAL 
Protocol V72203  – FINAL Version 9.0 
 FINAL: AMENDMENT 4 30 October  2019  - 18 - 7.2.3 Drug Dose Justification  
The doses of VERU -944 (cis -clomiphene) selected in this dose finding study are 10, 50 and 
100 mg daily.  Support for the utilization of these doses results from publ ished studies as well 
as additional work that the Sponsor has performed.  
In mouse studies, 40 mg/kg/day cis -clomiphene for 90 days results in a significant reduction 
in testicular weight as well as testicular degeneration (Fontenot GK et al., BJUI Int, 11 7:344 -
350, 2016).  Using the FDA published guidance on conversion from animal studies to humans 
(FDA, Maximum Safe Starting Dose in Initial Clinical Trials for Therapeutics in Adult 
Healthy Volunteers), the 40 mg/kg dose is multiplied by 0.08 resulting in a n equivalent 
human dose of 3.25 mg/kg.  For an average weight adult (70 kg) this would correspond to 227 
mg.  In the same study, at 4 mg/kg/day there were no effects on testicular degeneration but 
seminal vesicle weights were somewhat reduced. This dose wo uld correspond to a 22.7 mg in 
humans.  From this study, it appears that the efficacious range for cis -clomiphene will be 
above 22.7 mg with a maximum of 227 mg.  
In a study in baboons, administration of 1.5 mg/kg for 12 days resulted in mild 
reduction of t otal serum T levels, an estrogenic signal (Fontenot, unpublished 2001).  
Utilizing the FDA conversion from a baboon to a human dose (multiplication by 0.54), 
in an average adult, this would correspond to 56.7 mg further supporting our proposed 
dose range f or the Phase 2 study.   
In ovariectomized female rats 3 mg/kg cis -clomiphene for 90 days results in the 
restoration of uterine weight to the pre -ovariectomized state similar to a 0.1 mg/kg 
dose of estradiol (Turner RT et al., Endo, 139:3712 -3720, 1997).  A  3 mg/kg dose in 
rats would correspond to 33.6 mg daily dose in an average human.   
When hypogonadal men were treated with 25 mg daily clomiphene citrate for 6 
weeks, the median steady state level of cis -clomiphene was 44.0 ng/ml (Helo S et al., 
BJUI Int 1 19:171 -176, 2017).  Assuming that clinically available clomiphene citrate 
contains 30% cis -clomiphene, that would equate to 7.5 mg daily cis -clomiphene 
resulting in these steady state levels.  Extrapolating the daily doses that will be used in 
this study, a 10 mg dose will result in steady state level of 59 ng/ml, a 50 mg dose 
would result in 293 ng/ml and a 100 mg dose would result in 1,173 ng/ml.   
In order to determine if these concentration ranges would result in estrogenic activity, 
in vitro assays wer e utilized.  In a transactivation assay, the effective concentration of 
cis-clomiphene app ears to be in the range of 1.2 PM which correspond to a level 717.6 
ng/ml.  Based upon the Helo 2017 study, this blood level would be achieved within 
the dose finding  range of 50 mg and 100 mg.  In a separate in vitro study utilizing a in 
a rat hypothalamic cell line they observed an EC 50 of cis -clomiphene of 100 nM  
corresponds to a level of 60 ng/ml (Fitzpatrick SL Endo 140:3928 -3937, 1999).  This

Low doses of estrogens have b een shown to ameliorate vasomotor symptoms (hot

Protocol V72203  – FINAL Version 9.0 
 FINAL: AMENDMENT 4 30 October  2019  - 19 - prostate cancer.  A daily dose of 1 mg diethy lstilbestrol  (DES) over 12 weeks 
elimi nates the hot flashes in 86% of  these men (Atala A  et al., Urology, 1992).  
VERU -[ADDRESS_481684] 4 days of 
treatment, the subjects wi ll receive a loading dose that is determined by [CONTACT_85338] r 
maintenance dose (10, 50, or 1 00 mg). On day 1, subjects will take 5 times their 
maintenance dose at a single time; on days 2 ±4, subjects will take 3 times their 
maintenance dose at a single time.  
As me ntioned above, the rationale for the loading dose is to achieve steady state 
quickly to meet the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requirement for the 
demonstration of efficacy at Day 28 of dosing (FDA Draft Guidance for Industry, 
2003: Estrogen and Estro gen/Progestin Drug Products to Treat Vasomotor Symptoms 
and Vulvar and Vaginal Atrophy Symptoms ± Recommendations for Clinical 
Evaluation). Based upon the published 14.2 ±33.4 day half -life of cis clomiphene 
(Szutu et al., 1989), without a loading dose, eva luation of efficacy as reflected by [CONTACT_385074] 28. Therefore, Veru has developed a 
dosing regimen for this study that inc ludes loading doses (see Table below ).  
Cis-clomiphene , as part of the FDA approved product Clomid , has been used in men 
for off -label acute and chronic indications with limited reported safety observations. 
However, in an ongoing nonclinical toxicology study of VERU -944 in rats and beagle 
dogs, preliminary indications are that the dose of VERU -944 required to treat hot 
flashes in men with prostate cancer on ADT is between 10 -50 mg  (data on file) . 
Moreover, at a high dose of cis -clomiphene of 20 mg/kg/day (a human equivalent dose 
of 667 mg in a 60 kg human) in male dogs, dose limiting toxicities h ave been 
observed. The dose limiting toxicities that have been observed include elevations in 
liver function tests (AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, GGT, and total bilirubin), 
weight loss and death. No significant toxicities have been observed in the ongoin g 
study in rats. Due to the preliminary information that suggests a dose of VERU -[ADDRESS_481685] profile is determined at the 
blinded placebo, 10 mg and 50 mg dos es of VERU -944 in Stage 1 .

be carefully recorded.  
The blood  samples shou ld be collected in  a 6 mL K 2EDTA blood collection tube at each 
collection time .   
Immediately after collection, the tube s will be gently inverted several times to mix the 
anticoagulant with the blood sample. Blood samples may be kept on wet ice  (the use of ice 
packs in a water bath is also acceptable)  for up to 20 minutes until processed. The plasma 
fraction will be separate d by [CONTACT_385078] a centrifuge for 10 minutes at

plasma samples w ill be placed into a freezer at -20oC (or below) within 1 hour after 
collection . (NOTE: A flash freezing in dry ice or liquid nitrogen is NOT required under this 
protocol but may be used .)

8.13 Adverse Events  
An adverse event (AE) is any unfavorable or unintended change in body structure (signs) or 
body function (symptoms), abnormal laboratory result that is associated with symptoms or 
requires treatment, or w orsening of a pre -existing condition. This includes all such events 
regardless of the presumed relationship between the event and the study medication(s).  
Veru Inc  CONFIDENT IAL 
Protocol V72203  – FINAL Version 9.0 
 FINAL: AMENDMENT [ADDRESS_481699] will be assessed for the development of any adverse event s. Adverse events 
should be assessed at each visit to the clinic. This information should be obtained in the form 
of non -leading questions (e.g., "How are you feeling?") and f rom signs and symptoms 
detected during each examination, observations of the study personnel or spontane ous reports 
from the subjects.  
Any AEs such as complaints, signs, or symptoms that occur during the course of the study or 
designated follow -up periods will be recorded on the subject's case report form  (eCRF ). This 
would include AEs resulting from concurrent illnesses, reactions to concomitant medications, 
or progressive disease states.  
Whenever possible, the AE will be described on the case report form using standard medical 
terminology consistent with Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 
version [ADDRESS_481700] medication, 
outcome and action taken.  
Each AE will be evaluated for duration, intensity, and relationship to (or association with) the 
study treatment (or other causes). Additionally, the actions taken (e.g., reduction of dosage, 
discontinuation of study medication, administration of treatment, etc.) and the resulting 
outcome of the AE will be indicated on the case report form.  
Any subject who is withdrawn from the study due to an adverse event  will be followed until 
the ou tcome of the event is determined, and the investigator will prepare a written summary 
of the event and document the available follow -up information on the case report form.  
8.13.1  Intensity of Adverse E vents 
The intensity of the AEs will be graded according to CTCAE version 4. For any adverse event 
that is not specifically covered in CTCAE version 4, the following criteria  should be used : 
Veru Inc  CONFIDENT IAL 
Protocol V72203  – FINAL Version 9.0 
 FINAL: AMENDMENT 4 30 October  2019  - 30 - Grade Description 
1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic 
observations only; intervention not indicated 
2 Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; 
limiting age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living 
3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; limiting self-care activities of daily living 
4 Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated. 
5 Death related to AE 
If the intensity (Grade) changes within a day, the maximum intensity (Grade) should  be 
recorded. If the intensity (Grade) changes over a longer period of time, the changes should be 
recorded as separate events (having separate onset and stop dates for each grade).  
8.13.[ADDRESS_481701] M edication  Causality  
The relationship (or association) of each AE to the test medication will be assessed by [CONTACT_70723]:  
Unrelated:  There is no chance that the study medication caused the AE; other conditions, 
including concurrent illnesses, progression or expression of the disea se state, or a reaction to a 
concomitant medication best explain the event.  
Unlikely:  There is little chance that the study medication caused the AE; other 
conditions, including concurrent illnesses, progression or expression of the disease state, or a 
reaction to a concomitant medication best explain the event.  
Possible:  The association of the AE with the study medication is unknown; however, the 
AE is not clearly due to another condition.  
Probable:  A reasonable temporal association exists between the AE and treatment 
administration and, based on the investigator's clinical experience, the association of the AE 
with the study treatment seems likely.  
Definite:  The association of the AE with the study medication has a direct relationship.  
For the purpose of safety analyses, all AEs which are classified as "Possible," "Probable" or

Abuse or Medication Error  
AEs associated with study drug  overdose, misuse, abuse, and medication error refer to AEs 
associated with uses of the study drug outside of that specified by [CONTACT_760]. Overdose, 
misuse, abuse, and medication error are defined as follows:  
Overdose: Accidental or intentional use of t he study drug in an amount higher than the 
protocol -defined dose  
Misuse:  Intentional and inappropriate use of study drug not in accordance with the protocol  
Abuse: Sporadic or persistent intentional excessive use of study drug accompanied by [CONTACT_385083]: Any unintentional event that causes or leads to inappropriate study drug use

All AEs associated with overdose, misuse, a buse, or medication error should be captured on 
the Adverse Event eCRF and also reported using the procedures detailed in Reporting of 
SAEs even if the AEs do not meet serious criteria. Abuse is always to be captured as an AE. If 
the AE associated with an overdose, misuse, abuse, or medication error does not meet serious 
criteria, it must still be reported using the SAE form and in an expedited manner but should be 
noted as non -serious on the SAE form and the Adverse Event eCRF.

9.0 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
9.1 Sample  Size Calculation  
The proposed trial sample size, n=30 per  arm, total N= 90 in Stage 1 , is based on the mean 
change in hot flash frequency from baseline to Week 4  (Day 28) (the planned primary 
endpoint at the time of the original study design) . Other assumptions include: one -sided 
Į=0.10; ȕ=0. 10 (i.e., power=0.9), equal variances, the variance is equal t o the mean of the 
active arm, and a frequency in at least one treated arm that is 40% less than that of the placebo 
arm on Week  4 (Day 28). The same assumptions hold for Stage 2 as well with proposed trial 
sample size of n=30 per arm, N=60 in Stage 2.  Tot al enrollment if both stages are completed 
will be approximately N=150.    
All patients in screening at the time that the 90th patient is randomized into Stage 1 of the 
study that qualify for the study will be randomized into the study up to a maximum of 120 
patients (40 per arm) . In Stage 2, all patients in screening at the time the 60th patient is 
randomized into Stage 2 of the study that qualify for the study will be randomized into the 
study up to a maximum of 80 patients (40 per arm).   
9.2 Populations  
Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population:  All enrolled subjects who have taken at least one dose of 
study drug.  
Efficacy Evaluable  (EE) population:  All subjects in the ITT population who have 
analyzable baseline data and [ADDRESS_481708] 80% 
compliant with taking study drug with no major protocol deviations, including no major 
inclusion/exclusion deviations . 
Efficacy Evaluable  Interim Analysis ( EEIA) population:  All subjects in the ITT 
population who have analyzable baseline data and [ADDRESS_481709] 80% compliant with taking study drug with no major protocol deviations, 
including no major inclusion/exclusion de viations.  
Safety population: All subjects that receive at least one dose of study medication. The safety 
analyses will be conducted on this population.

Mixed model s repeated measures (MMRM) analyse s that incorporate , treatment, time, 
and the treatment*time interaction s will be the primary analytical method  for the 
percentage  change in the frequency of moderate to severe hot flashes .  The percentage  
change  from baseline  in frequ ency  of moderate to severe  hot flashes  in each active 
arm will be compared to the placebo arm at Week 6 (Day 42). The analysis will be 
handled in two ways within the MMRM framewor k: (1) the means analysis comparing 
the change from baseline to Week 6, and (2) the slope analysis comparing the rate of 
change from baseline to Week 6.  
 
The primary endpoint  in the study will be analyzed when the last patient reaches  Day 
42. However, the clinical site and patients will remain blinded through the completion 
of the Day 84 efficacy assessments and the follow up safety visits . 
Each VXbjecW¶V hRW flaVh fUeTXeQc\ will be summed on a weekly basis.  Becau se the 
MMRM is the primary analytical method, it will be possible to estimate Week 6 
changes from baseline by [CONTACT_385084] ¶ daWa , e.g., Week 6 
estimates will incorporate data from baseline and Week 1 through Week 6.  Analyses 
will be performed for the  EE (EEIA)  populations.  
If the MMRM model does not converge or has poor fit, T-tests or non-parametric 
tests, if the data are deemed non -normally distributed,  will compare changes over time 
within (Paired T -test or Wilcoxon sign -rank test) an arm and between (T-test or 
Wilcoxon rank sum test) each active arm and the placebo arm , respectively.  
The Hochberg procedure (Hochberg Y, 1988) will be applied to control for the 
multiple comparisons associated with the comparisons between  the two dose arms and 
placebo  and the two different MMRM analyses (means, slope) in the primary analyse s 
of frequency  of hot flash es in Stage [ADDRESS_481711] from those placebo subjects that

placebo arm at Week 4 (Day 28), Week 8 (Day 56), Week 10 (Day 70), and Week 12 
(Day 84).  Each analysis will be handled in two ways within the MMRM framework, 
as described for the primary analysis above.  
Each VXbjecW¶V hRW flaVh fUe quency (severity) will be summed on a weekly basis. 
Because the  MMRM is the primary analytical method, it will be possible to estimate 
Week s 4, 8, 10, and  12 changes from baseline by [CONTACT_385085]¶ 
data, e.g., Week s 4, 8, 10, and  12 estimates will incorporate data from baseline and 
Week 1 through Week s 4, 8, 10, and  12. Analyses will be performed for the ITT and 
PP populations.  
If the MMRM model does not converge or has poor fit, T -tests or non -parametric 
tests, if the data are deemed non -normally distributed, will compare changes over time 
within (Paired T -test or Wilcoxon sign -rank test) an arm and between (T -test or 
Wilcoxon r ank sum test)  each active arm and the placebo arm, respectively.  
If the MMRM model does not converge or has poor fit, non -parametric tests will  
compare changes over time within (Wilcoxon sign -rank test) an arm and between  
(Wilcoxon rank sum test) active arms and the placebo arm, respectively.  
The Hochberg procedure (Hochberg Y, 1988) will be applied to control for the 
multiple comparisons associated with the comparisons between the two dose arms and 
placebo and the two different MMRM analyses in the analyses of frequency (severity) 
of hot flashes for Stage 1. The analyses for Stage [ADDRESS_481712] from those placebo subjects that were enrolled

The severity of hot flash analysis will be the average severity at bas eline of only the 
moderate and severe hot flashes. The severity of hot flashes analysis at Weeks 4, 6, 8, 
10, and 12 will be the average severity of all hot flashes, i.e. mild, moderate, and 
severe hot flashes.

Due to the dose-intensive schedule, patient adherence to brimonidine therapy is low suggesting that there i s a need for a longer acting drug or longer acting formulation to reduce dosing 
frequency.  
Sun Pharma Advanced Research Company Ltd. (SPARC; Sponsor) has developed a once daily (QD) long -acting ophthalmic product consisting of 0.35% brimonidine tartrate suspension in a 
nano-bound resin.  This product allows for the sustained release and activity of brimonidine over an extended period of time for the treatment of elevated IOP. This nano- size ion exchange resin 
technology is already in the marketed hypotensive ophthalmic suspension, Betoptic S

hile lower concentrations of brimonidine are available (0.1, 0.15%, Alphagan® P, Allergan) for 
the treatment of glaucoma, t he Sponsor’s drug-resin complex suspension product is expected  
provide a slow, consistent, and sustained release likely reducing the immediate exposure to drug.   This feature has the potential for an  improved safety profile over the higher concentrations of 
marketed drug and allowing for a reduced medication burden from TID to QD.

3.0 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
This study is designed to obtain estimates on the mean IOP at each of the 3 time points (8:00 AM, 10:00 AM, 4:00 PM) on week 2, week 6 and week 12 in order to compare brimonidine tartrate 0.35% ophthalmic suspension, dosed QD at 8:00 AM and brimonidine tartrate 0.1%, dosed TID at approximately 8:00 AM, 2:00 PM, and 8:00 PM. 
The pri mary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of QD dosing with SPARC ’s brimonidine 
tartrate ophthalmic suspension 0.35% compared with brimonidine
 tartrate ophthalmic solution 
0.1% dosed TID  in subjects with open- angle glaucoma, or ocular hypertension.  
The secondary objective is to evaluate the safety of QD dosing with SPARC’s brimonidine 
tartrate ophthalmic suspension 0.35% compared with brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution 
0.1% dosed TID  in subjects with open- angle glaucoma, or ocular hypertension.

At the screening visit after signing the informed consent form ( ICF) form each subject will be 
allotted a subject number. The subject number will uniquely identify each subject in the study. 
The subject number will appear on all study documents relating to that subject.  Subject 
numbering will be described separately in dat a management plan.

Subjects who qualify inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomly assigned to study 
treatment using   
 
4.2.3 Masking  
This is an evaluator-masked study. The investigator or designated evaluator , masked to treatment 
assignment, will perform all ophthalmic examinations. Unmasked study coordinator may 
perform all study procedures other than ophthalmic/clinical examination, or treatment of the subjects. The investigator (if different from the evaluator) will  be responsible for deciding the type of medical care a subject will get; identifying the kinds of work a subject can safely perform while in the study, and assessment of safety . In order to maintain masking, the unmasked study

investigator and the subjects will be asked not to discuss the treatment received with the investigator or designated evaluator in order to maintain investigator/evaluator -masking.  
To minimize bias, T est and Reference bottles will be packed in an identical box with similar 
label.  
An unmasked site personnel  will instill the in -office physician dispensing (OPD) doses in a room 
separate from the evaluating investigator in order to maintain investigator -masking. As a means 
to maintain investigator masking, subjects in the SPARC 0.35% treatment group will be brought into the dosing room at each dosing time point (ie, 8:00 AM and 2:00 PM but will only receive study medication at the 8:00 AM time point). 
In order to maintain masking, the Investigator will not personally retrieve/review the study 
medication diary; designated study personnel will collect and review the diary at each visit to ensure treatment compliance.  
Subjects will be instructed  not to use the study medication on the morning of a study visit;

Females of childbearing potential must not be pregnant or lactating (as confirmed by a negative urine pregnancy test with a sensitivity of less than 50 mIU/mL or equivalent units of human chorionic gonadotropin). Women of childbearing potential must agree to the use of a reliable method of contraception (e.g., total abstinence, intrauterine device, a double- barrier method [such as condom plus diaphragm with spermicide], oral, 
transdermal,  injected or implanted non- or hormonal contraceptive), throughout the study. 
A sterile sexual partner is not considered an adequate form of birth control. Subjects on hormonal contraceptives must have been on the same hormonal contraceptive for at least one month before the Screening and continue throughout the duration of the study. A 
female is considered of childbearing potential if she has had her first  menses and she is 
either: not postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months prior to enrollment; or not 
surgically sterilized by [CONTACT_116894], or bilateral oophorectomy, or hysterectomy.   Male subjects with female partners of childbearing potential who are not 
using birth control as described above must use a barrier method of contraception (eg, condom) if not surgically sterile (ie, vasectomy).

During the course of the study CRO monitor, or designee, will make routine site visits to review 
protocol compliance, assess study drug accountability, and ensure the study is being conducted 
according to the pertinent regulatory  requirements.  The review of the subjects’ medical records 
will be performed in a manner that adequately maintains subject confidentiality.  Further details 
of the study monitoring will be outlined in a monitoring plan.  
Regulatory authorities of domestic and foreign agencies, quality assurance and or its designees 
may carry out on- site inspections and/or audits which may include source data checks.  
Therefore direct access to the original source data will be required for inspections and/or audits.  
All ins pections and audits will be carried out giving consideration to data protection as well as 
subject confidentiality to the extent that local, state, and federal laws apply.  
 
9.0 SAFETY REPORTING  
9.1 Reporting Adverse Events  
Any AE (clinical sign, symptom, or disea se) temporally associated with the use of this 
investigational product, whether or not considered related to the investigational product, shall be 
reported and documented on the CRF. All AEs reported by [CONTACT_116897]  [INVESTIGATOR_116889]. All entries should contain an event term, date of 
onset, date of resolution, severity, action taken, outcome, relationship to study drug, and a 
seriousness assessment. The investigator will document all AEs in the subject’s source 
document. All AEs occurring during the study, including during the washout interval, will be 
reported and documented on the CRF. 
9.1.1 Definitions  
Adverse Event  – Any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject 
administered a drug and does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An 
AE can therefore, be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational product, 
whether or not related to the investigational product.

prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], results in persistent or significant disability/ incapacity, is a 
congenital anomaly or birth defect or an important medical event or requires medical intervention.      
If death occurs, the primary cause of death or event leading to death should be recorded and reported as an SAE. “Fatal” will be recorded as the outcome of this specific event and death will not be recorded as separate event. Only, if no cause of death can be reported (eg, sudden death, unexplained death), the death per se might then be reported as an SAE. 
NOTE: The term "life -threatening" in the definition of "serious" refers to an event in which the 
subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event, which, 
hypothetically, might have caused death if it were more severe.  
A planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5912]-existing condition, or a procedure required per protocol without a serious deterioration in health or clearly not associated with an AE is not to be considered as an AE.

continues till end of study or early termination visit.  
Events that Do Not Meet the Definition of an SAE  
Elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_43930], or to simplify trial treatment or trial procedures are not 
considered SAEs. However, all events leading to unplanned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_116891] (e.g., undesirable effects of any administered treatment) must be documented and reported as SAEs.  
 
 
 
 
9.2 Procedures for Reporting Serious Adverse Events (SAE) and Suspected Unexpected 
Serious Adverse Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R)  
Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs must be reported  according to ICH GCP or local regulations, applying the regulation 
with the stricter requirements. The report will contain as much available  information concerning 
the SAE to enable the Sponsor’s safety physician/ CRO to file a report, which satisfies reg ulatory 
reporting requirements. The SAE report will be notified by [CONTACT_116898] 24-hours of his/ 
her awareness to the Sponsor’s safety physician/CRO. These timelines apply to initial reports of SAEs and to all follow-up reports. 
All AEs/SAEs will be  recorded on the AE Report Form and SAE report form in the eCRF and 
source documents.  
 
  
  
  
  
In the case of fatal or life- threatening events, please immediately telephone the Sponsor’s safety 
physician/CRO  also.

Sun Pharma Advanced Research Company Ltd.                          Confidential  49 Additional follow-up information should be completed on an SAE follow-up form with a copy 
sent to the Sponsor’s safety physician/CRO. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Requests for follow-up will usually be made via the responsible Sponsor’s safety physician/CRO.  
 
Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs):  
The applicable Regulatory Authorities shall be initially notified by [CONTACT_116899]/ 
CRO of any S[LOCATION_003]R, no later than 15 calendar days from the “date learned” of the event. The applicable Regulatory Authorities will be initially notified as per re gulation within 7 calendar 
days of any fatal or life -threatening S[LOCATION_003]R. If the safety report submitted within 7 calendar days 
is complete, an additional submission within 15 days from day 0 is not required.  
All participating Investigators and Ethics committee/ Institutional Review Board shall be notified 
of any S[LOCATION_003]R by [CONTACT_116900].

When medically necessary, the investigator may need to determine what treatment has been 
assigned to a subject. Site will contact [CONTACT_116901]. When possible (ie, in non- emergent situations), CRO 
and/or the study sponsor should be notified before unmasking investigational product.      
Unmasking details will be provided to Sponsor’s designated safety physician in case of S[LOCATION_003]R  
for regulatory reporting purpose only.  The code for all subjects will be broken when all subjects have completed the study, and all dat a 
for this period has been entered into the database and locked.

1.1 Synopsis
Protocol Title: 
A Phase II, Multicenter, Open-label Study to Investigate the Clinical Efficacy of M7824 
Monotherapy in Participants With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Biliary Tract Cancer Who Fail or are Intolerant to First-line Platinum-Based Chemotherapy
Short Title:
Phase II Study of M7824 Monotherapy in Participants With Locally Advanced or Metastatic 
Biliary Tract Cancer Who Fail or are Intolerant to First-line Platinum-Based Chemotherapy
Rationale:
There is no established second-line therapy for biliary tract cancer (BTC) as the standard of care 
according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network and European Society for Medical 
Oncology guidelines. M7824 (bintrafusp alfa) ta rgets the programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and 
transforming growth factor β, the 2 major mechanisms of immunosuppression in the tumor 
microenvironment and provides a rationale to overcome the resistance of checkpoint inhibitor monotherapy. A preclinical study showed that M7824 demonstrated enhanced antitumor activity and prolonged survival compared with checkpoint inhibitors in in vivo models. A clinical study of M7824 showed a promising result with a clinical efficacy signal of 23.3% (7 of 30 participants) confirmed objective response rate (ORR) assessed by [CONTACT_775329] 20% assessed by [CONTACT_107406] (IRC) in second-line BTC. Therefore, the current clinical study is supported by [CONTACT_775330].

Overall Design:
This is a Phase II, multicenter, international, single-arm, open-label, study to evaluate M7824 
monotherapy in participants with locally advanced or metastatic BTC who failed or were intolerant to first-line chemotherapy.
The study plans to enroll 141 eligible BTC participants. The participants will be included from the
[LOCATION_003], Europe, and Asian countries with competitive enrollment. The study will enroll 3 major subtypes of BTC, including intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma,and gallbladder cancer, with a minimum of 30 particip ants in each subtype. If one subtype does 
not reach a minimum of 30 participants by [CONTACT_775334] 141 participants, the study will continue to enroll only in this subtype to reach 30 participants. 
Participants will receive M7824 at a dose of 1200 mg once every 2 weeks until confirmed PD, 
death, unacceptable toxicity, or study withdrawal.
This study includes: 
!28-day Screening period.
!Treatment until confirmed PD per RECIST 1.1, death, unacceptable toxicity, or study 
withdrawal. In the case of PD, treatment may continue past the initial determination of PD or confirmed PD if the participant’s performance statu s has remained at least stable, and if in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], the participant will benefit from continued treatment and if other criteria are fulfilled as outlined in the protocol. Participants who have experienced a confirmedCR should continue treatment for a maximum of [ADDRESS_1064912] No.CCI

13/156Medical Monitor and the Sponsor Medical Responsib le. Participants with stable disease or PR 
should continue treatment until disease progression or any other discontinuation criterion is 
met.
!Safety Follow-up will continue until [ADDRESS_1064913] dose of M7824. The 12-week Safety 
Follow-up is allowed to be conducted via phone calls or patient chart reviews unless there is 
medical necessity requiring a clinical visit.
!Long-term Follow-up should be performed every 12 weeks after the Safety Follow-upaccording to the Schedule of Activities. Long-term Follow-up can be performed by [CONTACT_775335].
!Survival Follow-up will continue until each participant was followed up for at least 3 years after the End-of-Treatment.
Number of Participants: 
The planned total sample size is 141 participants based on the following assumptions:
1. ORR of 18%2. Alpha = 0.025 (1-sided) for the Exact test of the null hypothesis of an ORR ≤10%.
Under the given assumptions, the power to rej ect the null hypothesis at the primary analysis is 
80%.
Statistical Analysis:
There will be 2 data cutoff time points in this study:
!An per BTC subtype will be performed once 
[ADDRESS_1064914] one postbaseline tumor assessment. Each 
subtype will be analyzed separately once criteria are met.
!The primary analysis will be conducted [ADDRESS_1064915] of 141 planned participants.
!Second analysis for DRR and DOR will be conducted [ADDRESS_1064916] of 141 planned participants. The analysis will comprise a full evaluation of all efficacy and safety endpoints.
Study Intervention Groups and Duration: 
The study duration for a participant is estimated to be up to 3 years. This includes a 28-day 
Screening period (decision will be made in this period for participants’ study inclusion if all eligibility criteria are met); a treatment duration until confirmed PD, unacceptable toxicity, orstudy withdrawal occurs, a 28-day Safety Follow- up visit and a 12-week Safety Follow-up phone 
call after the last dose of M7824.

MS200647_0047
26/1562 Introduction
M7824 (bintrafusp alfa) is a first-in-class, intravenously administered bifunctional fusion protein 
that combines an antiprogrammed death-ligand 1 (anti-PD-L1) antibody and the soluble 
extracellular domain of the human transforming growth factor- β (TGF-β ) receptor as a TGF- β 
neutralizing “trap” into a single molecule. M7824 is being developed for the treatment of participants with locally advanced or metastatic biliary tract cancer (BTC) who failed or are intolerant to first-line (1L) chemotherapy. Bintrafusp alfa is the international nonproprietary name [INVESTIGATOR_8178] M7824.
M7824, as a monotherapy, has shown an acceptable safety profile and a promising clinical efficacy 
signal in a Phase Ib study of second-line (2L) BTC.
Detailed information on the chemistry, pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of M7824 is in the
Investigator’s Brochure (IB).
2.[ADDRESS_1064939] of care according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN 2018)  and European Society for Medical Oncology 
(Valle 2016) guidelines. The TGF- β pathway mutation is one of the key underlying molecular 
alterations of BTC tumorigenesis (Nakamura 2015) . M7824 is designed to target PD-L1 and 
TGF-β, 2 of the major mechanisms of immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment and
provides a rationale to overcome resistance of checkpoint inhibitor monotherapy. 
A preclinical study showed that M7824 demonstrated enhanced antitumor activities and prolonged 
survival compared with checkpoint inhibitors in in vivo models (Lan 2018) . A clinical study of 
M7824 showed a promising result with a clinical efficacy signal of 23.3% (7 of 30 participants) confirmed objective response rate (ORR) by [CONTACT_775336] 20% by [CONTACT_107406] (IRC) in 2L BTC. Therefore, the current clinical study is supported by [CONTACT_775330].
2.2 Background
BTC is a heterogeneous group of rare tumors that include intrahepatic and extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) and gallbladder cancer (NCCN 2018; Valle 2016) . Ampullary cancer 
can originate from the pancreas, duodenum, distal common bile duct, or the structures of the ampullary complex based on the anatomic location. For this reason, this study excludes ampullary cancer. There were approximately  12,190 estimated new cases and 3,790 estimated deaths in 2018 
in the [LOCATION_003] (Siegel 2018) . More than 90% of BTCs are adenocarcinomas (Hezel 2008) . Most 
patients with BTC have advanced disease at presentation and relapse despi[INVESTIGATOR_39662]; BTC cases have a poor prognosis, with an estimated 5-year overall survival (OS) of about 17.5% (Noone 
2018) . The recurrence rates are about 67% at 24 months among the few patients who undergo 
curative resection (Jarnagin 2003) . Unresectable BTC is treated with chemotherapy, but the 
median survival time is < 1 year (Valle 2010) . For patients with advanced-stage or unresectable

27/156BTCs, current standard of care is 1L systemic chemotherapy, that is a combination of gemcitabine 
and cisplatin. However, this 1L standard of care has limited effectiveness, with median OS < 1 year 
(Valle 2010) . 
There is no established 2L therapy for BTC as the standard of care for 2L chemotherapy. Basedon an update of a systematic review published in 2014 (Lamarca 2014) from available literature 
conducted in August 2018, which included 2L BTC studies reporting ORR results forchemotherapy alone or in association with an approved systemic anticancer therapy restricted to studies with > 20 participants (to avoid imprecise ORR estimates reported in smaller samples), [ADDRESS_1064940] was 7.2% with a 95% confidence interval (CI) ranging from 5.5% to 9.2%. Usi ng the upper limit of this  CI we assumed the benchmark ORR 
to be 10%.
M7824 has shown promising clinical efficacy signal in BTC patients progressing after 
platinum-based 1L treatment (Study MS200647-0008). Thir ty Asian participants were treated with 
M7824 at dose of 1200 mg every 2 weeks. As of 20 March 2018, 30 participants who had previously received 1L treatment for BTC, received M7824 for a median duration of 8.9 weeks (range: 2 to 57.6 weeks); 5 participants remained on treatment at the time of data cutoff. Seven participants had a confirmed objective response (OR) by [CONTACT_108074] (ORR 23.3%) and6 participants had a confirmed OR by [CONTACT_55543] (ORR 20%), including 1 confirmation of response after cutoff. Per anatomical location, the ORR was 14.3% (1 out of 7) in study participants with extrahepatic CCA and 40% (4 out of 10) in study participants with intrahepatic CCA, 16.6% (2 out of 12) in study participants with gallbladder carci noma. No responses were observed in ampullary 
cancer (0 out of 1). With a minimum follow-up of 8 months, the duration of response (DOR)ranged from 0.7 to 6.9 months with 5 of 7 responses ongoing at the data cutoff date. Besides the confirmed ORR, 1 additional participant had an ongoing partial response (PR) for 7.6+ monthsafter initial progression. The observed clinical efficacy, therefore, compares favorably to the calculated benchmark of existing 2L treatment options and there is a strong rationale with preclinical and clinical data to justify further clinical development of M7824 in 2L BTC, with the potential to establish M7824 as the standard of care.
In the Phase I Asian 2L BTC study, 2 treatment-related Grade 5 interstitial lung disease (ILD)
events have been reported in Japanese participants with an incidence of approximately 6.6%: [ADDRESS_1064941] M7824 dose. These 2 cases of treatment-related Grade 5 interstitial pneumonitis represent an incidence of approximately 0.3% 
in overall M7824 studies (2 adverse events [AEs] reports out of more than 670 treated participants). According to the literature reference, a higher ILD incidence is observed in the Japanese population (Takada 2014;  Azuma 2007; Vansteenkiste 2017) . For proper and early detection of 
ILD/pneumonitis events occurring in Japanese participants, serum KL-6, surfactant protein A (SP-A), and surfactant protein D (SP-D) levels will be  measured in study sites in Japan. Inclusion 
of these markers will potentially help to identif y treatment-emergent lung toxicity early on, which 
can be further confirmed by [CONTACT_9661] (Kubo 2013) .

28/1562.3 Benefit/Risk Assessment
At the time of study initiation, in Study MS200647- 0008, a Phase Ib study of 2L BTC, M7824 has
demonstrated promising clinical efficacy with a confirmed ORR of 23.3% (7 of 30 participants)
by [CONTACT_775336] 20% by [CONTACT_55543], suggesting that the clinical benefit could be substantially better than the historical benchmark. 
The following have been identified as important identified risks for M7824: Immune-related 
adverse events (immune-related pneumonitis, immune-related hepatitis, immune-related colitis, immune-related nephritis and renal dysfunction, immune-related endocrinopathies [thyroid disorders, adrenal insufficiency, Type 1 diabetes mellitus, pi[INVESTIGATOR_74276]], immune-related rash and other immune-related adverse events (irAEs) [myositis, myocarditis, encephalitis]), TGF-β inhibition mediated skin reactions, anemia and bleeding adverse events. Infusion-related 
reactions are classified as identified risk for the treatment with bintrafusp alfa.
The identified and potential risks with M7824 monotherapy across tumor types were overall 
manageable and no new safety signals emerged in the EMR200647-001/MS200647-0008 studies 
compared with therapi[INVESTIGATOR_107900]-(L)1 or TGF- β. M7824 infusion-related reactions (IRRs) 
were similar to those seen with monoclonal antibodies. The overall M7824 related IRRs wasobserved to be 5% with severity of low grade , well managed, and did not lead to permanent 
treatment discontinuation. The overall safety profile for irAEs is found to be consistent across M7824 studies and aligned with the known safety profile of approved anti-PD-(L)1 agents.
Dermatologic AEs related to TGF- β-inhibition (including keratoacanthomas [KA] and cutaneous 
squamous cell cancers) are an important identified risk with M7824 not seen with other 
programmed death-1 (PD-1)/PD-L1 antibodies. These lesions were previously observed in participants with genetic mutations in the TGF- βreceptor (i.e., Ferguson-Smith syndrome), and 
participants treated with the TGF-β -targeting agent fresolimumab (Goudie 2011; Morris 2014) . In 
the EMR200647-001/MS200647-0008 studies, treatment-emergent TGF- β inhibition mediated 
skin reactions were observed in approximately 7% of participants, were well-managed with simple excision (or spontaneous resolution) and did not require any participant to discontinue treatment. The risk of these lesions with M7824 was considered manageable in this study, especially in the context of encouraging clinical activity in several tumor types.
In view of the observed clinical efficacy in 2L BTC in M7824 and the manageable safety profile 
observed in the Phase I studies, the benefit/risk assessment is considered favorable to conduct this global study in 2L BTC participants, in consideration of the high unmet medical need and the current absence of an efficacious standard of care.
More detailed information about the known and expected benefits and risks and reasonably 
expected AEs of M7824 can be found in Section 4.[ADDRESS_1064942] No.CCI

4 Study Design
4.1 Overall Design
This is a Phase II, multicenter, international, single-arm, open-label study to evaluate M7824 
monotherapy in participants with locally advanced or metastatic BTC who failed or were intolerant to 1L chemotherapy.
The study plans to enroll 141 eligible BTC participants from [LOCATION_003], Europe, and Asian countries,
with competitive enrollment. The study will enro ll 3 major subtypes of BTC: intrahepatic CCA, 
extrahepatic CCA, and gallbladder cancer, with a minimum of [ADDRESS_1064945], or the structures of the ampullary complex.
Participants will receive M7824 at a dose of 1200 mg once every 2 weeks until confirmed 
progression of disease (PD), death, unacceptable toxicity, or study withdrawal. The primary objective is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of M7824 based on the ORR in 2L BTC. The secondary efficacy objectives are summarized in  Figure 1. Tumor response evaluation based on RECIST 1.1 
(Eisenhauer 2009)  will be performed every [ADDRESS_1064946] No.CCI

31/156This study includes: 
!28-day Screening period
!Treatment until confirmed PD per RECIST 1.1, death, unacceptable toxicity, or study 
withdrawal. In the case of PD, treatment may continue past the initial determination of PD or confirmed PD if the participant’s performance status (PS) has remained at least stable, and if in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], the participant will benefit from continued treatment and if other criteria are fulfilled as outlined in the protocol. Participants who have experienced a confirmed complete response (CR) should continue treatment for a maximum of 24 months after confirmation of response. If the Investigator believes that a participant with a confirmed CR may benefit from treatment beyond 24 months, it may be permissible to continue treatment after discussion with the Medical Monitor and the Sponsor Medical Responsible. Participants with stable disease or PR should continue treatment until disease progression or any other discontinuation criterion is met.
!Safety Follow-up will continue until [ADDRESS_1064947] dose of M7824. The 12-week Safety Follow-up is allowed to be conducted via telephone calls or patient chart reviews unless there is medical necessity requiring a clinical visit.
!Long-term Follow-up should be performed every 12 weeks after the Safety Follow-up
according to the Schedule of Activities (Table 1) . Long-term Follow-up should be performed 
by [CONTACT_775335].
!Survival Follow-up will continue until each participant was followed up for at least [ADDRESS_1064948] is inactivated either through mutation, allelic loss of 
heterozygosity, or through epi[INVESTIGATOR_775266]. Cancer genomic analysis of 260 BTCs showed that 15% to 20% of BTC has TGF- β pathway mutations suggesting 
that the TGF- β pathway alteration has high selection pressure and is important in BTC 
tumorigenesis (Nakamura 2015) . 
The TGF- β signaling inhibition is an emerging strategy for cancer therapy. TGF- β signaling 
influences the tumor microenvironment by [CONTACT_775337], angiogenesis, and metastasis, and suppressing immune-related host response. TGF- β inhibition is considered primarily to normalize 
tumor microenvironment homeostasis by [CONTACT_100276]-regulating stromal stimulation resulting from excess TGF- β production by [CONTACT_537571]-related tissues, reduce immunosuppression, as well 
as suppress epi[INVESTIGATOR_018]-to-mesenchymal transition that might further contribute to immune escape.

M7824, as a monotherapy, has shown a manageable safety profile and promising clinical efficacy 
signal in 2L BTC. Thirty Asian participants with BTC refractory to platinum-based 1L treatment were treated with M7824 1200 mg every 2 weeks. As of 20 March 2018, the median treatment duration was 8.9 weeks (range: 2 to 57.6 weeks). Five participants remained on treatment. Seven 
participants had a confirmed OR by [CONTACT_108074] (ORR 23.3%) and 6 participants had a confirmed OR by [CONTACT_55543] (ORR 20%), including 1 confirmation of response after cutoff. With a minimum follow-up of 8 months, the DOR ranged from 0.7 to 6.9 months, with 5/7 responses ongoing at the data cutoff date. One additional participant had ongoing PR for 7.6+ month after initial progression. Therefore, there is a strong rationale with preclinical and clinical data to justify further clinical development of M7824 in 2L BTC with the potential to establish M7824 as the standard of care.

33/156Since there is no established standard of care for 2L BTC, a Phase II, multicenter, international, 
single-arm, open-label study to evaluate M7824 monothe rapy in participants with locally advanced 
or metastatic BTC who fail 1L gemcitabine plus cisplatin chemotherapy has been proposed.
In this study participants who benefit from treatment will stay on treatment with frequent safety 
monitoring visits until unacceptable toxicity or loss of clinical benefit. Participants with confirmed CR will continue treatment for up to [ADDRESS_1064950] been exposed to M7824 beyond 12 months and the treatment was well tolerated. In Study MS200647-0008, some participants with OR had long lasting reduction in tumor size beyond 12 months under ongoing treatment. Treatment up to 24 months was also used with other checkpoint inhibitors published in 2L BTC (Ueno 2018) . In addition, recent data showed 
continuous treatment beyond 12 months of nivolumab significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) in non-small cell lung cancer compared to 12-month treatment duration (Spi[INVESTIGATOR_15174] 2017) .
4.3 Justification for Dose
The recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) for M7824 is 1200 mg administered as an intravenousinfusion once every 2 weeks. The selection of RP2D is based on the available clinical data from the Phase I Studies EMR200647-001 and MS200647-0008, including safety/tolerability, pharmacokinetic (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD-L1 target occupancy in peripheral blood mononuclear cell and TGF- β plasma concentrations), as well as efficacy in 2L non-small cell lung 
cancer cohorts from the EMR200647-001 study. The selection of RP2D is also supported by [CONTACT_102431] (PopPK) and exposure-response modeling and simulation. 
The completed and detailed data and analysis for dose justification can be found in IB.

6.6 Dose Selection and Modification
Participants will receive an intravenous infusion of M7824 at a dose of 1200 mg over 1 hour (- 10 minutes/+ 20 minutes, i.e., over 50 to 80 minutes) once every 2 weeks as detailed in the Schedule of Activities (Table 1) .
Dose modification of M7824 is not allowed. Special precautions for monitoring of participants and management of IRRs/hypersensitivity, including premedication, modifications of the infusion rate and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_90968], are described in Section 6.9.
6.6.1 Adverse Drug Reactions Requiring Treatment Modification
Any adverse drug reaction (ADR) assessed as related to M7824 may require permanent or transient discontinuation of M7824 treatment. For the management of certain ADRs assessed to be irAEs, follow the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guideline in Appendix 6.  Single 
laboratory values out of the normal range that do not have any clinical correlate do not necessarily need treatment interruption. Questions or concerns with regard to management and/or follow-upof ADRs should be discussed with the Medical Monitor.
Immune-related AEs, IRRs including hypersensitivity, anemia, TGF- βinhibition mediated skin 
reactions, and bleeding events are managed and followed up as described in their respective 
sections. Permanent study intervention discontinuation may be recommended, so the relevant section must be reviewed:
!For suspected irAEs, irAE management and guidance is presented in Appendix 6.  General 
management by [CONTACT_12134]-CTCAE v5.0 toxicity grading, as per ASCO, is listed below:

Management of Infusion-Related Reactions
Based on the observed low IRR incidence in Phas e I studies in over [ADDRESS_1064972] 15 participants, an 
Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will determine if mandatory premedication is needed. Study enrollment will continue in parallel to this review and sites will be notified accordingly if premedication will be required.
If IDMC determines mandatory premedication is justified in order to mitigate potential IRRs, 
premedication with an antihistamine and with paracetamol (acetaminophen) (e.g., 25 to 50 mg diphenhydramine and 500 to 650 mg paracetamol [acetaminophen] intravenous or oral equivalent) prior to each dose of M7824 is mandatory for the first [ADDRESS_1064973] No.CCI

ibuprofen 400 mg or comparable NSAID dose, may be administered 2 hours before and 8 hours after the start of each intravenous infusion.
6.9.2 Immune-Related Adverse Events
In general, the spectrum of irAEs is similar for M 7824 compared with other checkpoint inhibitors. 
Immune-related AEs are considered AESIs. Effective risk management of these toxicities (irAEs) primarily caused due to inhibition of PD-L1 and PD-1 pathways is based on key recommendations 
(Champi[INVESTIGATOR_136] 2016) . Participant education for on-time reporting of symptoms of potential irAEs and 
prompt clinical assessment is critical for effective management and quicker resolution of immune-mediated toxicities, thus preventing progre ssion into severe forms of toxicity that 
otherwise may become life-threatening and difficult to manage or warrant permanent discontinuation from the study.
Immune-related AEs are specific to immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_148348].The following immune-related AEs are important identified risks for M7824:
!Immune-related hepatitis
!Immune-related pneumonitis
!Immune-related colitis

!Immune-related endocrinopathies (thyroid disorders, adrenal insufficiency, Type 1 diabetes 
mellitus, pi[INVESTIGATOR_74276])
!Immune-related rash
!Other immune-related events (myositis, myocarditis, encephalitis)
The following irAEs are important potential risks for M7824:
!Guillain-Barré syndrome
!Uveitis
!Pancreatitis
!Myasthenia gravis/myasthenic syndrome
The Medical Monitor may be involved as needed for follow-up. Details of the diagnostic work-up 
will be requested by [CONTACT_3476].
For treatment management of irAEs per NCI-CTCAE v5.0 criteria, refer to the ASCO Clinical 
Practice Guidelines and National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) irAE management guidelines.
The recommendations for irAE management are guided by [CONTACT_775348] (Brahmer 2018) and NCCN guidelines, listed in Appendix 6.
Treatment of irAEs is mainly dependent upon sever ity as defined by [CONTACT_12134]-CTCAE v5.0. In general, 
management by [CONTACT_12134]-CTCAE v5.0 grading, as per ASCO, is listed below:
!Grade 1: study intervention should be continued with close monitoring, with the exception of 
some neurologic, hematologic, and cardiac toxicities. 
!Grade 2: study intervention may be suspended for most Grade 2 toxicities, with consideration 
of resuming when symptoms revert to Grade 1 or less. Corticosteroids may be administered 
(initial dose of 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day of prednisone or equivalent). 
!Grade 3: study intervention is generally susp ended and high-dose corticosteroids (prednisone 
1 to 2 mg/kg/day or methylprednisolone 1 to 2 mg/kg/day) treatment should be initiated. Corticosteroids should be tapered over the course of at least 4 to 6 weeks. Some refractory cases may require infliximab or other immunosuppressive therapy. 
!Grade 4: in general, permanent discontinuation of study intervention is recommended, with the exception of endocrinopathies that have been controlled by [CONTACT_108089].
Permanent treatment discontinuation is required in case of immune-related Grade 4 rash/inflammatory dermatitis, nephritis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, hemolytic uremic syndrome, aplastic anemia, immune thrombocytopenia and acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP).

For additional organ/system specific management guidelines, see the guideline tables in Appendix 6.
Recommended guidance and management for specific irAEs are provided in the current NCCN 
guideline available at http://www.nccn.org.
6.9.3 TGF-β Inhibition Mediated Skin Reactions
TGF-β inhibition mediated skin reactions, including hyperkeratosis, KA, and/or cSCCs, are 
important identified risks and AESIs for M7824.
Skin assessments are performed at Baseline and every 6 weeks for all participants per Schedule of 
Activities (Table 1) . Referral to a dermatologist is recommended in case of suspi[INVESTIGATOR_148352]. 
Baseline skin assessments include a detailed medical history of genetic or iatrogenic skin conditions, skin type, geographical location, significant UV exposure/sun damage of skin, and occupational or environmental exposure to radiation or chemicals.  
Skin AEs appear to be related to both mechanisms of M7824; anti-PDL1 and anti-TGF- β:
1. Immune-related skin AEs possibly mediated by [CONTACT_4002]-L1 inhibition (e.g., rash or 
maculopapular rash, distributed typi[INVESTIGATOR_107907]). 
2. Immune-related skin AEs should be managed according to ASCO Clinical Practice 
Guidelines (Appendix 6) . Treatment typi[INVESTIGATOR_775270], non-sedating 
antihistamines for pruritus, and targeted use of potent topi[INVESTIGATOR_775271]; oral corticosteroids can be used in highly symptomatic cases.
Skin AEs, possibly due to TGF- β inhibition, including hyperkeratosis, KA and/or cSCC, are 
important identified risks for M7824. The distribution of lesions tends to be in sun-exposed areas.
Management guidelines for potential TGF- β inhibition mediated skin reactions:
!Discontinuation or interruption is not required in most cases. Continuation of treatment should 
be evaluated by [CONTACT_737]. 
!Emollients may continue to be used
!Diagnostic and treatment plan should be developed in collaboration between Investigator and dermatologist. In general, treatment of TGF- βinhibition mediated skin reactions such as 
hyperkeratosis, KA, and cSCC should be based on local guidelines/standard of care. Lesion evaluation should include excision biopsy of one representative lesion to confirm diagnosis.

!For single lesions: 
oFull excision may be recommended. 
!In case of multiple lesions or location not suitable for full excision: 
oOther treatment options may be offered by [CONTACT_108094], such as: 
Mohs surgery, cryotherapy, or other standard treatment options depending 
on the pathology. 
Use of retinoids if recommended by [CONTACT_108095], may be considered after discussion with Medical Monitor.
!Close clinical follow-up for re-evaluation, resolution or potential recurrence should be 
implemented.
!Spontaneous resolution of KA lesions without surgical intervention has been observed, 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_775272] M7824.
!The number and localization of lesions, diagnosis (including histopathological diagnosis), treatment and outcome should be appropriately documented in the eCRF.
Consult with study Medical Monitor as needed for management of TGF- β inhibition mediated skin 
reactions.
6.9.4 Anemia
Anemia is an AESI (refer to IB) and important identified risk for M7824. Notably, there are many reasons for anemia in patients with advanced cancer, which is why a thorough investigation of new anemia cases of unspecified etiology is requested.
For new anemia events, items queried may include, but are not limited to, detailed relevant past 
medical and treatment history, bruising tendency, history of blood transfusions and/or dependency, and a request for an updated eCRF including details such as concomitant medications, all laboratory data, updated dosing information and recent tumor evaluation scans.
General guidance for anemia management and evaluation:
!Participants must enter the study with Hgb values at least 9 g/dL; routine blood test parameters 
are required in the Schedule of Activities (Table 1) .
!All relevant hematologic testing for anemias s hould be done prior to a blood transfusion, if 
clinically feasible.
!Transfusion should be performed at the discretion of the Investigator based on clinical assessment and considered when the participant experiences significant anemia. An attempt should be made to initiate work-up (as specified below) for the cause of anemia prior to transfusion, if clinically feasible, to not confound this work-up. In general, blood transfusions and erythroid growth factors are permitted for Hgb ≤7 g/dL and/or for life-threatening 
bleeding.

6.9.5 Bleeding Events
Bleeding events are AESIs and considered an important identified risk for M7824 (refer to the IB).
[IP_ADDRESS] Mucosal/Non-Tumor Bleeding
Mucosal bleeding events of mild to moderate severity were observed in participants treated with 
M7824 in ongoing studies. Events may include epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940], hemoptysis, gingival bleeding, or hematuria amongst others. In general, these reacti ons resolve without discontinuation of treatment. 
For all participants:
For Grade [ADDRESS_1064977] be permanently discontinued unless an 
alternative explanation can be identified (such as concomitant use of antithrombotic agents, traumatic event, etc.). In case of alternative explanations for the Grade 3 bleeding event, study intervention should be held until the event recovers to Grade ≤1.

Participants treated with M7824 were reported in lower frequencies, with Grade ≥ 3 hemorrhages 
including tumor bleeding.
For Grade ≥  [ADDRESS_1064979] be held until the event recovers to 
Grade≤1. Treatment should be permanently discontinued if the Investigator considers the 
participant to be at risk for additional severe bleeding.
6.9.6 Other Potential Risks
[IP_ADDRESS] Impaired Wound Healing 
Impaired wound healing is considered an important potential risk (a theoretical risk based on 
literature findings) for M7824, given the role of TGF- β in wound healing. Management should be 
discussed with the Medical Monitor for participants requiring surgery on study. It is recommended to hold study intervention for approximately [ADDRESS_1064980] major surgery for observation. Postoperative wound healing will be closely monitored.
[IP_ADDRESS] Embryofetal Toxicity
Embryofetal toxicities are a known risk of the PD -1/PD-L1 targeting class and are considered
important potential risks for M7824. Animal models link the PD-1/PD-L1 signaling pathway with maintenance of pregnancy through induction of maternal immune tolerance to fetal tissue. Embryofetal toxicity is an important potential risk of M7824. An appropriate contraception warning is provided as part of the inclusion criteria. Pregnant and breastfeeding women are not allowed in the M7824 study, and adequate contraceptive measures are recommended during the study to minimize or eliminate the potential risk to the developi[INVESTIGATOR_16103].
Respective safety measures comprise inclusion/exclusion criteria for participation in clinical 
studies with M7824, guidance for prevention, monitoring, and medical management of potential risks, as well as guidance on study intervention interruption or discontinuation.
[IP_ADDRESS] Disease Specific Risk: Hepatic Impairment
Biliary tract cancer can cause obstructive cholestasis complicated by [CONTACT_775349]. Acute cholangitis is a clinical syndrome characterized by [CONTACT_411], jaundice, and abdominal pain that develops as a result of stasis and infection in the biliary tract. Patients with acute cholangitis may develop septic shock and thus require frequent monitoring for evaluation of signs of shock. 
If biliary infection is suspected, the study intervention must be withheld. The Investigator should 
consider biliary drainage as well as treatment with antibiotics. If biliary tract infection is clinically 
improved, the study intervention can be resumed.

56/1567 Discontinuation of Study Intervention and Participant 
Discontinuation/Withdrawal
7.1 Discontinuation of Study Intervention
Participants will be withdrawn from study intervention for any of the following reasons:
!A participant may withdraw from the study intervention at any time at his/her own request (i.e.,
withdrawal of consent), and without giving a reason.
!Occurrence of an exclusion criterion, which is clinically relevant and affects the participant's 
safety, if discontinuation is considered necessary by [CONTACT_11219]/or Sponsor.
!A participant may be withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the Investigator for safety, behavioral, compliance, or administrative reasons.
!Confirmed PD per RECIST 1.1, with the exception that participants receiving treatment may continue past PD if the participant’s ECOG PS has remained stable, and if in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], the participant will benefit from continued treatment (See Section [IP_ADDRESS]) .
!Unacceptable toxicity
!Some ADRs require withdrawal from treatment. See Section  6.6.1 for additional details.
!Occurrence of pregnancy
!Use of a nonpermitted concomitant drug as defined in Section 6.5.3, where the predefined 
consequence is withdrawal from the study intervention.
The Schedule of Activities specifies the data to collect at study intervention discontinuation and follow-up, and any additional evaluations that need to be completed.
Obstructive jaundice and/or biliary tract infection without radiological PD, should not be cause for 
study intervention discontinuation if patients can be treated with prompt biliary drainage.
7.1.1 Temporary Discontinuation
See Section  6.9for information on temporary study intervention discontinuation.
7.1.2 Rechallenge
One reinitiation course of treatment after treatment discontinuation at the same dose and schedule is allowed at the discretion of the Investigator and upon agreement of the Study Medical Responsible for the following:
!Participants who are experiencing CR at the time of discontinuation, and then subsequently 
develop disease progression after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_7374], but prior to the end of the study.
Prior to reinitiation, the Investigator will need to confirm that the benefit of reinitiating treatment outweighs any risk involved, such as that which led to initial treatment discontinuation. For participants with only stable disease at the time of discontinuation, the Investigator should confirm

Bintrafusp Alfa (M7824) Phase II M7824 Monotherapy in 2L Biliary Tract Cancer
MS200647_0047
57/156that no other reasonable treatment options are available. In addition, to be eligible for reinitiation, 
the participant must not have previously withdrawn consent for this trial and should have been followed up with regular eCRF documented evaluation scans up to reinitiation of treatment.
A re-Baseline scan must be performed prior to reinitiation of study intervention. Additionally, 
relevant safety laboratory assessments, including both full hematology and full chemistry results within [ADDRESS_1064981] be available and verified. The clinical Investigator will determine whether additional evaluation and workup are required on a case-by-case basis. A discussion with the study team is warranted to determine whether PK/  testing is indicated upon restarting treatment.
The participant should reinitiate treatment at the treatment phase visit where they left off according 
to the Schedule of Activities (Table 1) . Participants who reinitiate treatment should stay on study 
and should be treated and monitored according the Schedule of Activities for the rest of the study. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Treatment Beyond Initial Progression
Treatment with M7824 should continue from the initial determination of disease progression by [CONTACT_26732] (verified PD) according to RECIST 1.1 until confirmed PD if the following criteria are met:
!No new unacceptable treatment or disease-related toxicity
!Tolerance of study interventions
!Stable or improving ECOG PS
!Treatment beyond progression will not delay an imminent intervention to prevent serious 
complications of disease progression (e.g., CNS metastases).
!Participants must sign a separate informed consent to ensure that they are aware of being treated beyond initial progression.
If the treatment continues after the verified PD, a radiographic assessment should be performed to confirm the PD at the next scheduled imaging. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Treatment Beyond Confirmed Progression
After confirmed PD, if the Investigator believes per clinical judgment that the participant continues to achieve clinical benefit by [CONTACT_775350] M7824, the participant can remain in the study and continue to receive monitoring according to the Schedule of Activities. The decision to continue treatment beyond confirmed PD should be discussed with the Medical Monitor and documented in the study records.
To qualify for treatment beyond confirmed progression:
!Participants must sign a separate informed consent to ensure that they are aware of being treated 
beyond confirmed progression.!Investigators must document clinical judgment to justify the continuation of study intervention
rather than other possible alternative treatments.

58/156Participants who continue treatment beyond progression will be evaluated for further tumor 
response as per the protocol Schedule of Activities (Table 1) . Treatment should be discontinued 
permanently in case of any overall, meaningful and unequivocal further increase in tumor burden after confirmation of PD. As a general guidance, a meaningful increase, for example, may represent an approximately 10% increase in tumor burden, considering the totality of all existing target lesions, non-target lesion burden, existing new lesions, and any further new lesions. Note: This 10% increase is provided as a general guide to be interpreted considering the clinical condition of the participant and any other considerations which the Investigator feels relevant, such as the availability of alternative treatments. In unclear situations, the Investigator should consult with the Medical Monitor, and the wellbeing of the individual participant should be the key consideration in determining the continuation of study intervention after confirmed progression.
[IP_ADDRESS] Continuation of Study Intervention After Local Treatment of 
Disease Progression
If disease progression is due to brain metastasis, pa rticipants may continue study interventions 
after local treatment of the brain lesions provided that the above criteria are met in addition to the following:
!PD is verified by [CONTACT_26732]. 
!Brain metastases have been treated locally and are clinically stable for at least 2 weeks prior to 
reinitiation of study interventions. 
!There are no ongoing neurological symptoms that are related to the brain localization of the 
disease (sequelae that are a consequence of the treatment of the brain metastases are acceptable). 
!Participants must be either off steroids or on a stable or decreasing dose of ≤10 mg daily 
prednisone (or equivalent). 
!Benefit-risk assessment to continue study intervention is favorable after consideration of any alternative treatment options as assessed by [CONTACT_737]. 
In addition, if disease progression is mainly due to a metastatic lesion, which in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_775273], participants may continue study interventions after the local treatment of such a lesion provided that:
!PD is verified by [CONTACT_55543]. 
!It has been at least 2 weeks and the participant has fully recovered from the surgery or 
radiotherapy.
!Benefit-risk assessment to continue study intervention is favorable after consideration of any alternative treatment options as assessed by [CONTACT_737].

!If the participant withdraws consent for future involvement in the study, any data collected up to that point may still be used, but no future data can be generated, and any biological samples collected will be destroyed (refer to the ICF).
!A participant has the right at any time to request destruction of any biological samples taken. The Investigator must document this in the site study records.
The Investigator will secure the safety of the study participants and make every attempt to collect data.
In case of discontinuation/withdrawal from the study:
!At study intervention discontinuation, the day of End-of-Treatment will correspond to the day

scheduled visits and is unable to be contact[CONTACT_9298].
The following actions will be taken if a participant fails to return to the study site for a required 
study visit:
!The site will attempt to contact [CONTACT_46342], counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascertain if the participant wants to or should continue in the study.
!Before a participant is deemed “lost to follow-up”, the Investigator or designee will make every effort to regain contact [CONTACT_6635]: 1) where possible, make 3 telephone calls; 2) if necessary, send a certified letter (or an equivalent local method) to the participant’s last known mailing address, and 3) if a participant has given the appropriate consent, contact [CONTACT_2299]’s general practitioner or caretaker (where allowed by [CONTACT_427]) forinformation. These contact [CONTACT_13140]’s medical record.
!If the participant continues to be unreachable, he or she will be considered to have withdrawn 
from the study.
8 Study Assessments and Procedures
!Study assessments and procedures and their timing are summarized in the Schedule of Activities
(Table 1) .
!Noprotocol waivers or exemptions are allowed.
!Immediate safety concerns are discussed with the Sponsor immediately upon occurrence or awareness to determine if the participant should continue or discontinue study intervention.
!Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the Schedule of Activities, is essential and required for study conduct.
!All Screening evaluations will be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential participants meet all eligibility criteria. The Investigator will maintain a Screening log to record details of all participants screened, to confirm eligibility, and if applicable, record reasons for Screening 
failure.
!Prior to performing any study assessments that are not part of the participant’s routine medical 
care, the Investigator will obtain written informed consent as specified in Appendix 2 (Study 
Governance).
!Procedures conducted as part of the participant’s routine medical care (e.g., blood count) and 
obtained before signing of the ICF may be used for Screening or Baseline purposes provided the procedures met the protocol-specified criteria and were performed within the time frame defined in the Schedule of Activities.

67/1568.3.1 Time Period and Frequency for Collecting Adverse Event and 
Serious Adverse Event Information
The AE reporting period for safety surveillance begins when the participant is initially included in 
the study (date of first signature [CONTACT_43998]/date of first signature [CONTACT_108166]) and continues until the 28-day Safety Follow-up visit, defined as 28 days (± 5 days) after the last study intervention administration. After this visit, all SAEs and non-serious treatment-related AEs should be documented until the last Safety Follow-up visit, defined as 12 weeks (± 2 weeks) after the last study inte rvention. Ongoing events at the 12-week Safety 
Follow-up visit should continue to be monitored and documented until resolution or resolution with sequelae, unless the participant is documented as “lost to follow-up”.
Any SAE assessed as related to study intervention must be recorded and reported, as indicated in 
Appendix 4, whenever it occurs, irrespective of the time elapsed since the last administration of study intervention.
The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of AEs (including SAEs) and the 
procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports are in  Appendix 4.
8.3.2 Method of Detecting Adverse Events and Serious Adverse 
Events
At each study visit, the participant will be quer ied on changes in his or her condition. During the 
reporting period, any unfavorable changes in the pa rticipant’s condition will be recorded as AEs, 
regardless if reported by [CONTACT_108101].
Complete, accurate, and consistent data on all AEs experienced for the duration of the reporting 
period (defined below) will be reported on an ongoing basis in the appropriate section of the eCRF. 
All SAEs must be additionally documented and reported using the appropriate SAE Report Form as specified in  Appendix 4.
8.3.3 Follow-up of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events
Adverse events are recorded and assessed continuously throughout the study, as specified in Section 8.3.1 (Time Period and Frequency for Collecting Adverse Event and Serious Adverse 
Event Information) and are assessed for their outcome at the 28-day Safety Follow-up visit.
All SAEs ongoing at the 28-day Safety Follow-up visi t must be monitored and followed up by [CONTACT_108102], unless the participant is documented 
as “lost to follow-up.” Reasonable attempts to obtain this information must be made and documented. It is also the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure that any necessary additional therapeutic measures and follow-up procedures are performed. Further information on follow-up 
procedures is given in Appendix 4 (Adverse Events: Definitions and Procedures for Recording, 
Evaluating, Follow-up, and Reports).

69/156Investigators must actively follow-up, document, and report on the outcome of all these 
pregnancies, even if the participants are withdrawn from the study.
The Investigator must notify the Sponsor/designee of these outcomes using the Pregnancy Report 
Form. If an abnormal outcome occurs, the SAE Report Form will be used if the participant sustains an event and the Parent-Child/Fetus Adverse Event Report Form if the child/fetus sustains an event. Any abnormal outcome (e.g., spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy) must be reported in an expedited manner, as specified in Section 8.3.1, while normal outcomes must be reported within [ADDRESS_1064996] be discontinued from study intervention. The Sponsor/designee must be notified without delay and the participant must be followed as indicated above.
8.4 Treatment of Overdose
!For this study, any dose of M7824 greater than 2 times (i.e., > 2400 mg) than the planned dose administered within a 24-hour time period will be considered an overdose. Of note: In the dose-escalation study (EMR200647-001), participants  safely received up to 30 mg/kg M7824 
every 2 weeks (including those with doses > 2400 mg) with no observed maximum tolerated dose (refer to the IB). Safety at significantly higher doses has not been clinically evaluated. 
!In case of overdose with clinical correlation, symptomatic treatment must be used; there are no known antidotes for the compound.
!In the event of an overdose, the study intervention infusion should be discontinued, and participants should be observed closely for any signs of toxicity. Supportive treatment should be provided if clinically indicated.
!Even if it not associated with an AE or a SAE, any overdose is recorded in the CRF and reported 
to drug safety in an expedited manner. Overdoses are reported on a SAE Report Form, following 
the procedure in  Appendix 4,  section on Reporting Serious Adverse Events.
!If an AE occurs resulting from an overdose, it should follow SAE reporting criteria as indicated in Appendix 4.
8.5 Pharmacokinetics
!Whole blood samples of approximately 3.5 mL will be collected for measurement of serum concentrations of M7824. Collection times are specified in the Schedule of Activities(see Section 1.3; Table 2) . The actual date and time (24-hour clock time) of each sample will 
be recorded to calculate actual time elapsed since the prior dose administration.
!The quantification of M7824 in serum will be performed using a validated assay method. Concentrations will be used to evaluate the PK of M7824.
!Remaining samples collected for analyses of M7824 concentration may also be used to evaluate immunogenicity and safety, or efficacy aspects related to concerns arising during or after the study.

9.2 Sample Size Determination
The study aims at demonstrating an ORR > 10% in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population by

The planned total sample size is 141 participants based on the following assumptions:
1. ORR of 18%
2. Alpha = 0.025 (1-sided) for the Exact test of the null hypothesis of an ORR ≤10%.
Under the given assumptions, the power to reject the null hypothesis at the primary analysis (PA)
is 80%.
An observed ORR of 15.6% (22/141) would achieve a positive ORR outcome and would lead to 
an exact 95% CI of (10%, 22.7%).

Characterization of ORR in Individual BTC Subtypes
To characterize ORR in each individual BTC subtype (intrahepatic CCA, extrahepatic CCA and 
gallbladder cancer), subgroup analysis of ORR will be performed. With the planned overall sample size of 141 and assuming frequencies of 45% intrahepatic CCA, 30% extrahepatic CCA, and 25% gallbladder cancer, enrolment of at least 30 participants per subtype can be expected even in case the actual rate of participants with gallbladder cancer is below the assumed rate of 25%. A subgroup of 25% of the overall sample size of 141 participants would results in 35 participants.
Risk of observing a high ORR in a subgroup by [CONTACT_775355] (“H0”)With a sample size of 30 participants and assuming a true ORR of 10%, the probability to observe 
at least 5 (16.7%) responders is 17.5%.Risk of observing a low ORR in a subgroup by [CONTACT_775356] 18% (“H1”) With a sample size of 30 participants and assuming a true ORR of 18% (same as assumed for 
overall population), the probability to observe no more than 4 (13.3%) responders is 35.1%.
BTC subtype analyses are not powered for a formal statistical test, e.g., [ADDRESS_1065000] 
15.8% power to reject the null hypothesis of ORR ≤10%, using the same assumption of ORR of 
18% and alpha = 0.025 (1-sided).
Justification of the Assumption of a Confirmed ORR of 18%
M7824, as a monotherapy, has demonstrated promising clinical efficacy signal in 2L BTC. As of 
20 March 2018, 30 participants with pretreated BTC received M7824 for a median duration of 8.9 weeks (range: 2 to 57.6 weeks); 5 participants remained on treatment. Seven participants had a confirmed OR (ORR, 23.3% by [CONTACT_775336] 20% by [CONTACT_55543], including 1 confirmation of response after data cutoff). Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the confirmed ORR of M7824 in 2L BTC is 18% or higher.

75/156Justification of the Assumption of a Benchmark ORR of 10% to Define the Study Sample 
Size
The benchmark for the ORR for 2L treatments is based on an update of a systematic review 
published in 2014 (Lamarca 2014)  from available literature conducted in August 2018. Based on 
this updated review, which included 2L BTC studies reporting ORR results for chemotherapyalone or in association with an approved systemic anticancer therapy restricted to studies with > 20 participants (to avoid imprecise ORR estimates reported in smaller samples), [ADDRESS_1065001] 
was 7.2% with a 95% CI ranging from 5.5% to 9.2%. Using the upper limit of this CI we assumed the benchmark ORR to be 10%.
9.3 Populations for Analyses
The analyses populations are specified below. The final decision to exclude participants from any analysis population will be made during a data review meeting prior to database lock.
For purposes of analysis, the analysis populations are defined in Table 9.

9.4.1 Efficacy Analyses
[IP_ADDRESS] Analysis of Primary Endpoint
The primary endpoint is confirmed OR according to RECIST 1.1, as determined by [CONTACT_26708]. For 
an OR of PR or CR, confirmation of the response according to RECIST 1.1 will be required no sooner than 4 weeks after the initial documentation of CR or PR. Confirmation of PR can be confirmed at an assessment later than the next  assessment after the initial documentation of PR. 
The response at each scheduled tumor assessment a nd the OR will be listed for each participant. 
The number and proportion of OR (defined as CR + PR) will be tabulated. The ORR will be determined as the proportion of participants w ith a confirmed OR of PR or CR. The 95% CI for 
the ORR will be calculated using the Clopper-Pearson method. The test statistic of the exact

Participants for whom the DOR is censored will be treated as failures (successes) in the analysis of durable response if the censored DOR is below (at least) 6 months. The DRR is defined as the percentage of participants with durable response. The 95% CI for the DRR will be calculated using the Clopper-Pearson method.
Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from first administration of study intervention to the 
date of death due to any cause. Participants last kno wn to be alive will be censored at date of last 
contact.
The Kaplan-Meier method will be used to estimate parameters for DOR, PFS, and OS. In 
particular, the PFS rate at 6 and 12 months will be estimated with corresponding 2-sided 95% CIs, and the survival rate at 6 and 12 months will be estimated with corresponding 2-sided 95% CIs. The CIs for the median will be calculated according to Brookmeyer and Crowley (Brookmeyer 
and Crowley 1982)  and the CIs for the survival function estimates at the time points defined above 
will be derived using the log-log transformation according to Kalbfleisch and Prentice (Kalbfleisch 
and Prentice 1980) . The estimate of the standard error will be computed using Greenwood’s 
formula. The DOR, PFS, and OS will also be presented in participant listings.
The association between PD-L1 expression and efficacy endpoints – primarily ORR and 
DOR/DRR – will be analyzed.

79/156Adverse Events
All AEs will be coded according to the MedDRA. Severity of AEs will be graded using the 
NCI-CTCAE v5.0 toxicity grading scale. 
The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), regardless of attribution, and 
TEAEs defined as possibly related to M7824 will be summarized by [CONTACT_167500] (SOC) and described in terms of intensity and relationship to M7824. TEAEs are those events with onset dates occurring during the on-treatment period or if the worsening of an event is during the on-treatment period. Any AEs with an onset or worsening date after the on-treatment period will be reported separately.
The incidence of SAEs and AESIs will be summarized by [CONTACT_775359].Descriptive statistics will be examined for indications of dose-related ADRs.
Laboratory Variables 
Laboratory results will be classified by [CONTACT_250002]-CTCAE v5.0. The worst on-study 
grades after the first study intervention will be summarized. Shifts in toxicity grading from first treatment to highest grade will be displayed. Resu lts for variables that are not part of NCI-CTCAE 
v5.0 will be presented as below, within, or above normal limits. Only participants with postbaseline laboratory values will be included in these analyses. 
Physical Examination (Including Vital Signs and 12-Lead ECGs)
Physical examination findings, including vital signs (body temperature, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], heart rate, 
and blood pressure) and 12-lead ECGs, as indicated in the Schedule of Activities (Table 1)  will be 
presented. 
Further details will be provided in the IAP based on current safety experience applying the latest 
MedDRA version.
All safety analyses will be performed on the Safety Analysis population.

Proteins (refer to FDA; December 2009, draft).
A validated method to detect ADAs in the presence of drug in human serum will be applied. The ADA titers of positive samples will be determined. Positive samples may be further evaluated for neutralizing capability. Individual participants will be categorized across all valid ADA results as ever-positive versus never-positive. ADA ever-pos itive participants will be further categorized as 
pre-existing, including treatment boosted, versus treatment emergent. ADA treatment-emergent participants will be further subdivided into transient positive and persistent positive.
Individual participants may be categorized across all valid neutralizing antibody results as 
ever-positive versus never-positive. Neutralizing antibody ever-positive participants may be 
further categorized as pre-existing versus treatment-emergent. Neutralizing antibody treatment-emergent participants may be further subdivided into transient positive and persistent positive.
Listings of drug concentration, TEAEs, and efficacy measures may be prepared for ADA 
ever-positive participants.

Contraceptive use by [CONTACT_775362]. 
Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP) 
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming postmenopausal unless 
permanently sterile, as specified below. 
If fertility is unclear (e.g., amenorrhea in adolescents or athletes) and a menstrual cycle cannot be 
confirmed before the first dose of study intervention, consider additional evaluation. 
A WOCBP is not : 
1. Premenarchal 2. A premenopausal female with 1 of the following: 
!Documented hysterectomy 
!Documented bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656] 
!Documented bilateral oophorectomy.
Documentation can come from the site personnel’s review of the female’s medical records, 
medical examination, or medical history interview. 
For a female with permanent infertility due to an alternate medical cause other than the above, 
(e.g., Mullerian agenesis, androgen insensitivity), Investigator discretion applies to determine study entry. 
3. A postmenopausal female 
!A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical
cause. 
!A high follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level in  the postmenopausal range may be used 
to confirm a postmenopausal state in a female not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy (HRT). However, in the absence of [ADDRESS_1065015] No.CCI

97/156Appendix 4 Adverse Events: Definitions and Procedures for Recording, 
Evaluating, Follow-up, and Reporting
Definitions
Adverse Event
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product, 
regardless of causal relationship with this treatment. Therefore, an AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, regardless if it is considered related to the medicinal product.
For surgical or diagnostic procedures, the condition/illness leading to such a procedure is 
considered as the AE rather than the procedure itself.
The Investigator is required to grade the severity or toxicity of each AE.Investigators will reference the NCI-CTCAE, v5.0 (publication date: 27 November 2017), a 
descriptive terminology that can be used for AE reporting.
A general grading (severity/intensity; hereafter referred to as severity) scale is provided at the 
beginning of the above referenced document, and specific event grades are also provided.
If the severity for an AE is not specifically grad ed by [CONTACT_12134]-CTCAE, the Investigator is to use the 
general NCI-CTCAE definitions of Grade [ADDRESS_1065016] medical 
judgment.
The 5 general grades are:
!Grade 1 or Mild
!Grade 2 or Moderate
!Grade 3 or Severe 
!Grade 4 or Life-threatening 
!Grade [ADDRESS_1065017] also be reported as an SAE. However, a 
laboratory abnormality of Grade 4, such as anemia or neut ropenia, is considered serious only if the 
condition meets one of the serious criteria specified below.
If death occurs, the primary cause of death or event leading to death should be recorded and 
reported as an SAE. “Fatal” will be recorded as the outcome of this specific event and death will not be recorded as separate event. Only, if no cause of death can be reported (e.g., sudden death, unexplained death), the death per se might then be reported as an SAE.

Object No.CCI
CCI
Bintrafusp Alfa (M7824) Phase II M7824 Monotherapy in 2L Biliary Tract Cancer
MS200647_0047
98/156Investigators must also systematically  assess the causal relationship of AEs to study intervention 
(including any other non-study interventions, radiation therapy, etc.) using the following 
definitions. Decisive factors for the assessment of causal relationship of an AE to the study intervention include, but may not be limited to, te mporal relationship between the AE and the study 
intervention, known side effects of study intervention, medical history, concomitant medication, course of the underlying disease, and study procedures.
Unrelated: Not reasonably related to the study intervention. AE could not medically 
(pharmacologically/clinically) be attributed to  the study intervention under study in 
this clinical study protocol. A reasonable alternative explanation must be available.
Related: Reasonably related to the study intervention. AE could medically (pharmacologically/clinically) be attributed to  the study intervention under study in 
this clinical study protocol. 
Abnormal Laboratory Findings and Other Abnormal Investigational Findings
Abnormal laboratory findings and other abnormal investigational findings (e.g., on an ECG trace) 
should not be reported as AEs unless they are associated with clinical signs and symptoms, lead to study intervention discontinuation or are considered otherwise medically important by [CONTACT_737]. If a laboratory abnormality fulfills these criteria, the identified medical condition (e.g., anemia or increased ALT) must be reported as the AE rather than the abnormal value itself.
Serious Adverse Events
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:
!Results in death
!Is life-threatening. Life-threatening refers to an ev ent in which the participant is at risk of death 
at the time of the event, not an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it was more 
severe.
!Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_43928]
!Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity
!Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect
!Is otherwise considered to be medically im portant (e.g., new cancer). Important medical events 
that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_107922], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.
For the purposes of reporting, any suspected transmission of an infectious agent via a study intervention is also considered an SAE, as specified below for reporting SAEs.

99/156Events that Do Not Meet the Definition of an SAE
Elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_43930], or to simplify study intervention or procedures (e.g., an 
overnight stay to facilitate intravenous therapy) are not considered SAEs. However, all events leading to unplanned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_43931] (i.e.,undesirable effects of any administered treatment) must be documented and reported as SAEs.
Events Not to Be Considered as AEs/SAEs
Medical conditions present at the initial study visit that do not worsen in severity or frequency 
during the study are defined as Baseline Medical Conditions and are not to be considered AEs.
AE/SAEs Observed in Association With Disease Progression
Progression of the disease/disorder being studied assessed by [CONTACT_108133] (including laboratory abnormalities) should not be reported as an (S)AE, unless the participant’s general condition is more severe than expected for the participant’s condition and/or unless the outcome is fatal within the AE reporting period, as defined in Section  8.3.2.
Adverse Events of Special Interest
Infusion-related reactions including hypersensitivity, immune-related AEs, TGF- β inhibition 
mediated skin reactions, anemia, and bleeding AEs are all considered as AESI for M7824.
Other Adverse Events to be Reported Following a Specialized Procedure 
Not applicable.
Recording and Follow-up of AE and/or SAE
It is important that each AE report include a description of the event, its duration (onset and 
resolution dates and also onset and resolution times, when it is important to assess the time of AE onset relative to the recorded study intervention administration time), its severity, its causal relationship with the study intervention, any other potential causal factors, any treatment given or other action taken, including dose modification or discontinuation of the study intervention, and its outcome. In addition, serious cases should be identified, and the appropriate seriousness criteria documented.
Specific guidance is in the eCRF Completion and Monitoring Conventions provided by [CONTACT_429].

100/156Reporting Serious Adverse Events
Serious Adverse Events
In the event of any new SAE occurring during the reporting period, the Investigator must 
immediately (within a maximum of 24 HOURS after becoming aware of the event) inform the Sponsor or its designee using the electronic SAE Report Form in the Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system.
Reporting of SAEs using a paper report form is required as a back-up method only for an EDC 
system failure. Names, addresses, and telephone and fax numbers will be included on the paper 
form. All information from the paper form must be transcribed into the electronic form as soon as the system becomes available.
In exceptional circumstances, an SAE (or follow-up information) may be reported by [CONTACT_756]; 
in these cases, an electronic SAE Report Form must be completed immediately thereafter.
Relevant pages from the eCRF may be provide d in parallel (e.g., medical history, concomitant 
drugs). Additional documents may be provided by [CONTACT_737], if available (e.g., laboratory 
results, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27450], autopsy report). The Investigator must respond to any request  for follow-up information (e.g., additional 
information, outcome, final evaluation, other records where needed) or to any question the 
Sponsor/designee may have on the AE within the same timelines as those noted above for initial reports. This is necessary to ensure prompt assessment of the event by [CONTACT_43971] (as applicable) to allow the Sponsor to meet strict regulatory timelines associated with expedited safety reporting obligations.
Requests for follow-up will usually be made via the study monitor, although in exceptional 
circumstances the drug safety department may c ontact the Investigator directly to obtain further 
information or to discuss the event.

102/156Appendix 6 Management of irAEs
This appendix provides recommendations to the Investigators for the management of irAEs. The 
contents are based on the NCCN irAE management guidelines (in Accordance with the Joint American Society of Clinical Oncology Clinical Practice Guidelines and National Comprehensive Cancer Network, Brahmer JR, 2018) and FDA recommendations to require permanent treatment discontinuation for Grade 4 irAEs (unless otherwise indicated in the tables below). Differences with ASCO/NCCN irAE management guidelines as recommended by [CONTACT_775363]. Critical instructions include the requirement that treatment must be permanently discontinued for the following Grade 4 irAE toxicities: Rash/inflammatory dermatitis, nephritis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, hemolytic uremic syndrome, aplastic anemia, immune thrombocytopenia, acquired TTP, and in certain circumstances, lymphopenia.
The management of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) in patients treated with immune 
checkpoint inhibitors is presented in the following tables:

triggered by [CONTACT_79422], such as herpes simplex viruses, but can be associated with an immune-related drug 
eruption and if progresses to erythema multiforme major, it and can be a harbinger of SCAR, such as SJS), 
lichenoid (resembling the ﬂat-topped, polygonal, and sometimes scaly or hypertrophic lesions of lichen-planus), 
eczematous (in ﬂammatory dermatitis characterized by [CONTACT_108135], erythematous, scaly, or crusted papules or 
plaques on the skin, which is vulnerable to superinfection, psoriasiform [resembling the well-demarcated, 
erythematous, and scaly papules and plaques of psoriasis], morbilliform [a nonpustular, nonbullous measles-
like exanthematous rash of the skin often referred to as “maculopapular” and without systemic symptoms or 
laboratory abnormalities, excluding occasional isolated peripheral eosinophilia], palmoplantar erythrodysesthesia [hand-foot syndrome; redness, numbness, burning, itching, and super ﬁcial desquamation 
of the palms and soles], neutrophilic dermatoses [e.g., Sweet syndrome], and others)
Diagnostic work-up
Pertinent history and physical examination
Rule out any other etiology of the skin problem, such as an infection, an effect of another drug, or a skin 
condition linked to another systemic disease or unrelated primary skin disorderIf needed, a biologic checkup, including a blood cell count and liver and kidney testsDirected serologic studies if an autoimmune condition is suspected, such as lupus or dermatomyositis: a 
screening antinuclear antibody test, SS-A/Anti-Ro, SS-B/Anti-La if predominantly photodistributed/photosensitivity, antihistone, double-stranded DNA, and other relevant serologies. Consider 
expanding serologic studies or diagnostic work-up if other autoimmune conditions are considered based on 
signs, symptoms 
Skin biopsyConsider clinical monitoring with use of serial clinical photographyReview full list of patient medications to rule out other drug-induced cause for photosensitivity
Grading Management
Grading according to CTCAE is a challenge for skin. 
Instead, severity may be based on BSA, tolerability, morbidity, and duration.
G1: Symptoms do not affect the quality of life or controlled with topi[INVESTIGATOR_107923]/or oral antipruriticContinue ICPi
[INVESTIGATOR_107924]/or mild-moderate 
potency topi[INVESTIGATOR_107925]
G2: In ﬂammatory reaction that affects quality of life 
and requires intervention based on diagnosisConsider holding ICPi [INVESTIGATOR_108045]. If not resolved, interrupt treatment until skin AE has reverted to Grade 1
Consider initiating prednisone (or equivalent) at 
dosing 1 mg/kg, tapering over at least 4 weeks
In addition, treat with topi[INVESTIGATOR_39669], oral 
antihistamines, and medium- to high-potency topi[INVESTIGATOR_030]
G3: As G2 but with failure to respond to indicated 
interventions for a G2 dermatitisHold ICPi [INVESTIGATOR_775275], oral antihistamines, and

1.2 Bullous dermatoses
Deﬁnition: Including bullous pemphigoid or other autoimmune bullous dermatoses, bullous drug reaction
Diagnostic work-up
Physical examinationRule out any other etiology of the skin problem, such as an infection, an effect of another drug, or a skin 
condition linked to another systemic disease
If needed, a biologic checkup, including a blood cell count, liver, and kidney tests; consider serum antibody 
tests to rule out bullous pemphigoid or, under the guidance of dermatology, sending patient serum for indirect 
immuno ﬂuorescent testing to rule out other autoimmune blistering diseases
Referral to dermatology for blisters that are not explained by [CONTACT_108137] (e.g., herpes 
simplex, herpes zoster, bullous impetigo, bullous insect bite, friction or pressure blister)
Consider skin biopsy (both hematoxylin and eosin evaluation of lesional skin and direct immuno ﬂuorescence 
evaluation of perilesional skin)
Grading Management
G1: Asymptomatic, blisters covering < 10% BSA and 
no associated erythemaIf blisters are < 10% BSA, asymptomatic, and nonin ﬂammatory (such as the case with friction 
blisters or pressure blisters), cessation of ICPi [INVESTIGATOR_775276], and only observation and/or local wound 
care is warranted
When symptomatic bullae or erosions, which are 
deroofed vesicles or bullae, are observed on the skin or mucosal surfaces, the cutaneous irAE is by [INVESTIGATOR_5328]ﬁnition considered at least G2
See G2 management recommendations
G2: Blistering that affects quality of life and requires intervention based on diagnosis not meeting criteria 
for grade > 2
Blisters covering 10% to 30% BSAHold ICPi [INVESTIGATOR_107931]-up and to determine appropriateness of 
resuming
Attention given to general local wound care, which 
includes plain petrolatum ointment and bandages or 
plain petrolatum ointment gauze and bandage over any open erosions, which are left over on the skin after the blister has popped or if the roof of the blister 
easily sloughs off
Counsel patients to avoid skin irritants and 
overexposure to sun, wear protective clothing, use sunscreens
Work-up for autoimmune bullous disease as aboveInitiate class 1 high-potency topi[INVESTIGATOR_11977] 
(e.g., clobetasol, betamethasone or equivalent) and reassess every 3 days for progression or

Primer on monitoring for complicated cutaneous 
adverse drug reactions:
Review of systems: Skin pain (like a sunburn), fevers, malaise, myalgias, arthralgias, abdominal pain, ocular discomfort or photophobia, sores or 
discomfort in the nares, sores or discomfort in the 
oropharynx, odynophagia, hoarseness, dysuria, sores or discomfort in the vaginal area for women or involving the meatus of the penis for men, sores in 
the perianal area, or pain with bowel movements
Physical examination: Include vital signs and a full 
skin examination speci ﬁcally evaluating all skin 
surfaces and mucous membranes (eyes, nares, oropharynx, genitals, and perianal area). Assess for lymphadenopathy, facial or distal extremity swelling 
(may be signs of DIHS/DRESS). Assess for pustules 
or blisters or erosions in addition to areas of “dusky erythema,” which may feel painful to palpation. To assess for a positive Nikolsky sign, place a gloved ﬁnger tangentially over erythematous skin and apply 
friction parallel to the skin surface. Nikolsky sign is 
positive if this results in detached or sloughing epi[INVESTIGATOR_775277], which is the case in some

2.0 GI Toxicities
2.1 Colitis
Deﬁnition: A disorder characterized by [INVESTIGATOR_2993] ﬂammation of the colon
Diagnostic work-up
G2
Work-up of blood (CBC, comprehensive metabolic panel, TSH, ESR, CRP), stool (culture, Clostridium difficile, 
parasite, CMV or other viral etiology, ova and parasite) should be performed
Consider testing for lactoferrin (for patient strati ﬁcation to determine who needs more urgent endoscopy) and 
calprotectin (to follow-up on disease activity)Screening laboratories (HIV, hepatitis A and B, and blood QuantiFERON for TB) to prepare patients to start 
inﬂiximab should be routinely done in patients at high risk for those infections and appropriately selected 
patients based on infectious disease expert’s evaluation
Imaging (e.g., CT scan of abdomen and pelvis and GI endoscopy with biopsy) should be considered as there 
is evidence showing that the presence of ulceration in the colon can predict a corticosteroid-refractory course, 
which may require early in ﬂiximab
Consider repeating endoscopy for patients who do not respond to immunosuppressive agents; repeating 
endoscopy for disease monitoring can be considered when clinically indicated and when planning to resume 
therapy
G3-4
All the work-up listed for G2 (blood, stool, imaging, and scope with biopsy) should be completed immediatelyConsider repeating endoscopy for patients who do not respond to immunosuppressive agents; repeating 
endoscopy for disease monitoring should only be cons idered when clinically indicated and when planning to 
resume ICPi
[INVESTIGATOR_107941] (based on CTCAE for diarrhea, as most 
often used clinically)Management
All patients Counsel all patients to be aware of and inform their 
health care provider immediately if they experience:
Abdominal pain, nausea, crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], blood or mucus 
in stool or changes in bowel habits Fever, abdominal 
distention, obstipation, constipation
For G2 or higher, consider permanently discontinuing 
CTLA-4 agents and may restart PD-1, PD-L1 agents if patient can recover to G1 or less; concurrent immunosuppressant maintenance therapy should be 
considered only if clinically indicated in individual 
cases

such as Imodium if infection has been ruled out
Should consult with gastroenterology for G2 or higherAdminister corticosteroids, unless diarrhea is 
transient, starting with initial dose of 1 mg/kg/day 
prednisone or equivalent
When symptoms improve to G1 or less, taper 
corticosteroids over at least 4-6 weeks before resuming treatment, although resuming treatment while on low-dose corticosteroid may also be an 
option after an evaluation of the risks and bene ﬁts
EGD/colonoscopy, endoscopy evaluation should be 
highly recommended for cases grade ≥2 to stratify 
patients for early treatment with in ﬂiximab based on 
the endoscopic ﬁndings and to determine the safety 
of resuming PD-1, PD-L1 therapy
Stool in ﬂammatory markers can be considered 
(lactoferrin and calprotectin) in cases of G2 or higher 
to differentiate functional v in ﬂammatory diarrhea, 
and use calprotectin to monitor treatment response if provider prefers
Repeat colonoscopy is optional for cases of G2 or 
higher for disease activity monitoring to achieve 
complete remission, especially if there is a plan to resume ICPi
G3: Increase of seven or more stools per day over baseline, incontinence, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_374], severe increase in ostomy output compared with 
baseline, limiting self-care ADLShould consider permanently discontinuing CTLA-4 
agents and may restart PD-1, PD-L1 agents if patient can recover to G1 or less.
Administer corticosteroids (initial dose of 1-2 mg/kg/d 
prednisone or equivalent)
Consider hospi[INVESTIGATOR_775283] ≥3-5 days or recur after 
improvement, consider administering IV 
corticosteroid or noncorticosteroid (e.g., in ﬂiximab)
Consider colonoscopy in cases where patients have been on immunosuppression and may be at risk for opportunistic infections as an independent cause for 
diarrhea (i.e., CMV colitis) and for those who are 
anti-TNF or corticosteroid refractory
G4: Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicatedPermanently discontinue treatment
Should admit patient when clinically indicated; 
patients managed as outpatients should be very closely monitored
Administer 1-2 mg/kg/d methylprednisolone or 
equivalent until symptoms improve to G1, and then start taper over 4-6 weeks
Consider early in ﬂiximab 5-10 mg/kg if symptoms 
refractory to corticosteroid within 2-3 days Consider 
lower GI endoscopy if symptoms are refractory despi[INVESTIGATOR_107945] (not approved in Japan) may be considered in patients refractory to in ﬂiximab and/or 
contraindicated to TNF- αblocker. The decision should be made on an individual basis from gastroenterology

(bradycardia, hypothermia) Thyroid supplementation 
and reassessment as in G2
Additional considerations
For patients without risk factors, full replacement can be estimated with an ideal body weight–based dose of 
approximately 1.6 μg/kg/d
For elderly or fragile patients with multiple comorbidities, consider titrating up from low dose, starting at 25- 50 mg
Extreme elevations of TSH can be seen in the recovery phase of thyroiditis and can be watched in asymptomatic 
patients to determine whether there is recovery to normal within 3-4 weeks
Under guidance of endocrinology, consider tapering hormone replacement and retesting in patients with a history 
of thyroiditis (initial thyrotoxic phase)
Adrenal dysfunction, if present, must always be replaced before thyroid hormone therapy is initiated 
4.1.2 Hyperthyroidism
Deﬁnition: Suppressed TSH and high normal or elevated FT4 and/or triiodothyronine
Diagnostic work-upMonitor TSH, FT4 every 4-[ADDRESS_1065036] disease (e.g., 
ophthalmopathy)
Close monitoring of thyroid function every 2-3 weeks after diagnosis to catch transition to hypothyroidism in 
patients with thyroiditis and hyperthyroidism

Additional considerations
Thyroiditis is transient and resolves in a couple of weeks to primary hypothyroidism or normal. Hypothyroidism can 
be treated as above. Graves disease is generally persistent and is due to increased thyroid hormone production that can be treated with antithyroid medical therapy. Physical examination ﬁndings of ophthalmopathy or thyroid 
bruit are diagnostic of Graves and should prompt early endocrine referral.
4.2 Adrenal – primary adrenal insuf ﬁciency
Deﬁnition: Adrenal gland failure leading to low morning cortisol, high morning ACTH, as well as hyponatremia and 
hyperkalemia with orthostasis and volume depletion due to loss of aldosterone
Diagnostic work-up for patients in whom adrenal insuf ﬁciency is suspected:
Evaluate ACTH (AM), cortisol level (AM)
Basic metabolic panel (Na, K, CO
2, glucose)
Consider ACTH stimulation test for indeterminate 
results

cortisol) is found biochemically:
Evaluate for precipi[INVESTIGATOR_107967]/hemorrhage
Grading Management
G1: Asymptomatic or mild symptoms Consider holding ICPi [INVESTIGATOR_107968] (5-10 mg daily) 
or hydrocortisone (10-20 mg orally every morning, 5-10 mg orally in early afternoon)
May require ﬂudrocortisone (0.1 mg/d) for 
mineralocorticoid replacement in primary adrenal 
insuf ﬁciency
Titrate dose up or down as symptoms dictate
G2: Moderate symptoms, able to perform ADL Consider holding ICPi [INVESTIGATOR_107969]
(if prednisone, 20 mg daily; if hydrocortisone, 20- 30 mg 
in the morning, and 10-20 mg in the afternoon) to manage acute symptoms.

iatrogenic, secondary adrenal insuf ﬁciency. ACTH will also be low in these patients. A diagnosis of adrenal 
insuf ﬁciency is challenging to make in these situations (see next section on hypophysitis).
Emergent therapy for someone with suspected adrenal insuf ﬁciency is best done with dexamethasone as a 
stimulation test can still be performed. If the diagnosis is already con ﬁrmed, can use hydrocortisone 100 mg.
All patients need education on stress dosing and a medical alert bracelet for adrenal insuf ﬁciency to trigger stress-
dose corticosteroids by [CONTACT_108140].
Endocrine consultation prior to surgery or any procedure for stress-dose planning.

117/1564.0 Endocrine Toxicity
Monitor patients for hyperglycemia or other signs and symptoms of new or worsening DM, including measuring 
glucose at baseline and with each treatment cycle during induction for 12 weeks, then every 3-6 weeks thereafter. 
To guide the work-up in new-onset hyperglycemia, clinicians should consider a patient’s medical background, 
exposure history, and risk factors for each subtype of DM.
Laboratory evaluation in suspected T1DM should include testing for ketosis in urine and an assessment of the 
anion gap on a metabolic panel. Anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase, anti-islet cell, or anti-insulin antibodies are highly speci ﬁc for autoimmune diabetes. Insulin and C-peptide levels can also assist in the diagnosis.

(8.9 mmol/L); no evidence of ketosis or laboratory 
evidence of T1DMCan continue ICPi [INVESTIGATOR_107974]-up and laboratory evaluation

Additional considerations
Insulin therapy can be used as the default in any case with hyperglycemiaLong-acting therapy alone is not usually suf ﬁcient for T1DM, where half of daily requirements are usually given in 
divided doses as prandial coverage and half as long acting.Insulin doses will be lower in T1DM because of preserved sensitivity (total daily requirement can be estimated at 
0.3-0.4 units/kg/d).
In T2DM, sliding-scale coverage with meals over a few days provides data to estimate a patient’s daily 
requirements and can be used to more rapi[INVESTIGATOR_107978].

Deﬁnition: A disorder characterized by [INVESTIGATOR_2993] ﬂammation of the joints
Clinical symptoms: Joint pain accompanied by [CONTACT_108142]; in ﬂammatory symptoms, such as stiffness after 
inactivity or in the morning, lasting > 30 minutes to 1 hour; improvement of symptoms with NSAIDs or 
corticosteroids but not with opi[INVESTIGATOR_107979] ﬂammatory arthritis.
Diagnostic work-up
G1Complete rheumatologic history and examination of all peripheral joints for tenderness, swelling, and range of 
motion; examination of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_107980] x-ray/imaging to exclude metastases and evaluate joint damage (erosions), if appropriate
Consider autoimmune blood panel including ANA, RF, and anti-CCP, and anti-in ﬂammatory markers (ESR and 
CRP) if symptoms persist; if symptoms are suggestive of reactive arthritis or affect the spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], consider HLA B27 
testing
G2Complete history and examination as above; laboratory tests as aboveConsider US ± MRI of affected joints if clinically indicated (e.g., persistent arthritis unresponsive to treatment, 
suspi[INVESTIGATOR_107981])
Consider early referral to a rheumatologist, if there is joint swelling (synovitis) or if symptoms of arthralgia persist 
> [ADDRESS_1065040] advice and reviewMonitoring: Patients with in ﬂammatory arthritis should be monitored with serial rheumatologic examinations, 
including in ﬂammatory markers, every 4-6 weeks after treatment is instituted.
Grading Management
All Grades Clinicians should follow reports of new joint pain to 
determine whether in ﬂammatory arthritis is present; 
question whether symptom new since receiving ICPi

G2: Moderate pain associated with signs of 
inﬂammation, erythema, or joint swelling, limiting instrumental ADLHold ICPi [INVESTIGATOR_775289] ≤10 mg/d 
Escalate analgesia and consider higher doses of NSAIDS as needed
If inadequately controlled, initiate prednisone or 
prednisolone 10-20 mg/d or equivalent for 4-6 weeks
If improvement, slow taper according to response 
during the next 4-6 weeks; if no improvement after initial 4-6 weeks, treat as G3
If unable to lower corticosteroid dose to < 10 mg/d after

Synthetic: methotrexate, le ﬂunomide
Biologic: consider anticytokine therapy such as TNF- α
or IL-6 receptor inhibitors. (Note: As caution, IL-6 
inhibition can cause intestinal perforation; while this is extremely rare, it should not be used in patients with colitis.) Test for viral hepatitis B, C, and latent/active 
tuberculosis test prior to DMARD treatment
Referral to rheumatology.
Additional considerationsEarly recognition is critical to avoid erosive joint damage.
Corticosteroids can be used as part of initial therapy in in ﬂammatory arthritis, but due to likely prolonged treatment 
requirements, physicians should consider starting corticosteroid-sparing agents earlier than one would with other 
irAEs
Oligoarthritis can be treated early on with intra-articular corticosteroids; consider early referral.Consider PCP prophylaxis for patients treated with high dose of corticosteroids for 12 weeks, as per local 
guidelines.

[IP_ADDRESS] Treatment 
Beyond Initial 
ProgressionAddition of the following text:
!Participants must sign a separate 
informed consent to ensure that they are 
aware of being treated beyond initial 
progression.To include a separate informed consent if a participant wants to continue to receive 
treatment after disease progression as per 
the [LOCATION_003] FDA’s request.
[IP_ADDRESS] Treatment 
Beyond Confirmed ProgressionAddition of following text: 
To qualify for treatment beyond confirmed 
progression:
!Participants must sign a separate 
informed consent to ensure that they are aware of being treated beyond confirmed progression.
!Investigators must document clinical 
judgment to justify the continuation of 
study drug rather than other possible alternative treatments.
Treatment should be discontinued permanently in case of any overall, meaningful and unequivocal further increase 
in tumor burden after confirmation of PD. As 
a general guidance, a meaningful increase, for example, may represent an approximately 10% increase in tumor burden, considering 
the totality of all existing target lesions, 
non-target lesion burden, existing new lesions, and any further new lesions. Note: This 10% increase is provided as a general 
guide to be interpreted considering the 
clinical condition of the participant and any other considerations which the Investigator feels relevant, such as the availability of 
alternative treatments. In unclear situations, 
the Investigator should consult with the Medical Monitor, and the wellbeing of the individual participant should be the key 
consideration in determining the continuation 
of study drug after confirmed progression.To include a separate informed consent if a participant wants to continue to receive treatment after disease progression as per the [LOCATION_003] FDA’s request.

NameDescription of Change Brief Rationale
4.2 Scientific 
Rationale for 
Study DesignAddition of the following text:
Treatment in this study is limited to 
24 months. Only participants who benefit from treatment (either stable disease, 
PR, or CR) will stay on treatment with 
frequent safety monitoring visits. In the M7824 program, participants have been exposed to M7824 beyond 12 months 
and the treatment was tolerated. In 
study MS200647_0008, some participants with objective responses had long lasting tumor shrinkages 
beyond 12 months under ongoing 
treatment. Treatment up to 24 months was also used with other checkpoint inhibitors published in 2L BTC (Ueno 
2018). In addition, recent data showed 
continuous treatment beyond 12 months of nivolumab significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) in 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 
compared to 12-month treatment duration (Spi[INVESTIGATOR_15174] 2017).A scientific rationale for treatment up to 24 months was provided based on the published literature.
6.5.3 Prohibited MedicinesAddition of the following text:
Concomitant local or regional treatment 
(radio/chemo-embolization) are not permitted.To provide direction to sites that radio/chemo-embolization are not allowed as they can confound the efficacy results of M7824 
monotherapy.

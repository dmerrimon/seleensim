 3.0 OBJECTIVES & HYPOTHES ES 
3.1 Hypotheses  
1. The immune checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab has clinically meaningful antitumor 
activity in solid tumor patients with functional deficiency in the Fanconi Anemia (FA) 
pathway in their tumors.  
2. The Fanconi Anemia Triple Stain Inmmunofluorescence ( FATSI ) assay through 
detecting the lack of repair foci formation in the nucleus of proliferating cells will be 
able to identify these patien ts, and a FATSI negative assay will be associated with a 
better rate of responses  than FATSI positive tumors .  
3.2 Primary Objective  
To evaluate the Immune- Related Objective Response Rate (IR -ORR) achieved with 
pembrolizumab in patients with  Fanconi Anemia  Repair Pathway  functionally competent  
and functionally deficient tumors  
3.3 Secondary Objective 
To evaluate immune -related progression -free rate at 20 weeks ( irPFS) and Overall Survival 
(OS) achieved with pembrolizumab in patients with Fanconi Anemia Repair Pathway 
functionally competent  and functionally deficient tumors.  
3.4. Exploratory Objective s 
      1. To evaluate mutation load and alterations in homologous recombination repair genes or 
other mechanisms of repair in blood specimens.  
      2. To evaluate gut microbiome composition of stool specimens in patients receiving 
pembrolizumab in this trial.  
 
4.0 BACKGROUND & RATIONALE  
 
4.1. Homologous Recombination Repair as an Anticancer Target  
Excitement has been generated following the identification of mutations on the BRCA genes 
as potential predictors of response to PARP inhibitors and recent clinical trials demonstrating 
antitumor activity with PARP inhibitors in cancer patients with  germline BRCA deficiency [1 -
5]. The rationale  behind these observations is that the BRCA genes are involved in homologous 
recombination (HR), an example of double -strand break repair, and patients with inherited 
BRCA germline heterozygocity who  developed cancer had acquired BRCA homozygous 
deficiency  in their tumors. The resulting genetic instability becomes an advantage for the tumor 
to perpetuate. Targeting an additional repair pathway, such as base excision repair through 
PARP inhibition would induce inability for the tumor to survive, an example of a concept 
commonly called synthetic lethality.  
Protocol Number: MK -3475- 663  Protocol Version Date: 20 JUL 2020  
         Protocol Versi on: 16

 The BRCA genes collaborate 
with several others in the 
Fanconi Anemia (FA) HR 
pathway [6- 15]. Seventeen  
complementation groups/genes 
plus other interactive proteins 
have been described. 
Monoubiquitination of  FancD2 
and Fanc I by [CONTACT_792974]-localization with other DNA 
damage response proteins result 
in the formation of nuclear 
repair foci, thus foci formation 
is the focal functional output of this pathway  (Fig 1) . Based on this, w e developed an 
immunofluorescence based method, FancD2/DAPI/Ki67 (Fanconi Anemia Triple Stain 
Immunofluorescence - FATSI), which permits the observation of FancD2 foci formation (or 
lack thereof) in the nucleus of proliferating cells in paraffin embedded tumor tissues [16 ], and 
screened >600 patients in a clinical trial for foci formation deficiency (Table 1) [1 7]. 
Functional deficiency was found in 29% of solid tumor patients. We also developed a targeted 
FA sequencing panel to evaluate potential genetic defects resulting in FA functional deficiency 
in our patients, and confirmed the ability of the FATSI test to enrich for patients exhibiting 
these alterations at the genomic level.

 We also showed that it is safe to administer the PARP inhibitor veliparib  at doses up to 300 
mg per day to patients with FA deficient tumor s, and that veliparib can be safely combined 
with the DNA damaging agent mitomycin C. Activity was seen for the combination in heavily 
pretreated patients  [17]. However, veliparib as a single agent, outside of BRCA/RAD51 
germline mutated breast cancer did not show a substantial level of clinical activity . Potential 
reasons for this discrepancy would include: 1 - veliparib is a weak PARP -trappi[INVESTIGATOR_231505] 
[18,19]; 2 - restoration of FA functionality as a result of systemic treatment received between 
the time of tissue collection and enrollment in the trial [ 20-23]; or 3 - the presence of a dditional 
mutations to which the repair deficient cell has become addicted (non -oncogenic 
addiction/induced -essentiality) [2 4-25]. 
4.[ADDRESS_1093172] immune surveillance in controlling outgrowth of neoplastic 
transformatio n has been known for decades .  Accumulating evidence shows a correlation  
between tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in cancer tissue and favorable prognosis in 
various malignancies .  In particular, the presence of CD8+ T -cells and the ratio of CD8+ 
effector T -cells / FoxP3+ regulatory T -cells seems to correlate with improve d prognosis and 
long-term survival in many solid tumors.  
The PD -[ADDRESS_1093173] hijacked by [CONTACT_55548].  The normal function of PD -1, expressed on the cell surface of activated T -
cells under healthy conditions, is to down- modulate unwanted or excessive immune responses, 
including autoimmune reactions.  PD -1 (encoded by [CONTACT_13228]1) is an Ig superfamily 
member related to CD28 and CTLA -4 which has been shown to negatively regulate antigen 
receptor sig naling upon engagement of its ligands (PD -L1 and/or PD -L2).  The structure of 
murine PD -1 has been resolved.  PD -1 and family members are type I transmembrane 
glycoproteins containing an Ig Variable -type (V -type) domain responsible for ligand binding 
and a  cytoplasmic tail which is responsible for the binding of signaling molecules.  The 
cytoplasmic tail of PD -1 contains 2 tyrosine -based signaling motifs, an immunoreceptor 
tyrosine -based inhibition motif (ITIM) and an immunoreceptor tyrosine -based switch mo tif 
(ITSM).  Following T -cell stimulation, PD -[ADDRESS_1093174] from that of CTLA -4 as both molecules regulate an overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_272446] t of signaling 
proteins .  PD -1 was shown to be expressed on activated lym phocytes including peripheral 
CD4+ and CD8+ T -cells, B -cells, T regs a nd Natural Killer cells .  Expression has also been 
shown during thymic development on CD4- CD8 - (double negative) T -cells as well as subsets 
of macr ophages and dendritic cells .  The ligan ds for PD -1 (PD -L1 and PD -L2) are 
constitutively expressed or can be induced in a variety of cell types, including non-
hematopoietic tissues as well as in  various tumors .  Both ligands are type I transmembrane 
receptors containing both IgV - and IgC -like domains in the extracellular region and contain 
short cytoplasmic regions with no known signaling motifs.  Binding of either PD -[ADDRESS_1093175] notably on vascular endothelium, 
whereas PD -L2 protein is only detectably expressed on antigen- presenting cells found in 
Protocol Number: MK -3475- 663  Protocol Version Date: 20 JUL 2020  
         Protocol Versi on: 16 
7 
 lymphoid tissue or chronic inflammatory environments.  PD -L2 is thought to control immune 
T-cell activati on in lymphoid organs, whereas PD -L1 serves to dampen unwarranted T -cell 
function in peripheral tissues .  Although healthy organs express little (if any) PD -L1, a variety 
of cancers were demonstrated to express abundant levels of this T -cell inhibitor.  PD -1 has 
been suggested to regulate tumor -specific T -cell expansion in s ubjects with melanoma .  This 
suggests that the PD -1/PD -L1 pathway plays a critical role in tumor immune evasion and 
should be considered as an attractive target for therapeutic interve ntion.  
Pembrolizumab is a potent and highly selective humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the 
IgG4/kappa isotype designed to directly block the interaction between PD -1 and its ligands, 
PD-L1 and PD -L2.  KeytrudaTM (pembrolizumab) is indicated for the t reatment of patients with 
unresectable or metastatic melanoma; for the first -line treatment of patients with metastatic 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have high PD -L1 expression [Tumor 
Proportion Score (TPS) ≥ 50%)] as determined by [CONTACT_13247] -approved test, with no EGFR or 
ALK genomic tumor aberrations; for the treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC whose 
tumors express PD -L 1  ( T P S  ≥  1 % )  a s  d e t e r m i n e d  by  a n  F D A -approved test, with disease 
progression on or after platinum -containing chemotherapy; for the treatment of patients with 
recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) with disease 
progression on or after platinum -containing chemotherapy based on tumor response rate and 
durability of response; and for the treat ment of adult and pediatric patients with refractory 
classical Hodgkin lymphoma, or who have relapsed after [ADDRESS_1093176] two indications .  
4.3 Preclinical and Clinical Trial Data for Pembrolizumab  
Refer to the Investigator’s Brochure for Preclinical and Clinical data.  
4.4 The Interp lay between DNA repair deficiency and Immune Checkpoint inhibition.  
Le et a l. recently reported a phase 2 study evaluating the clinical activity of pembrolizumab, 
in 41 patients with progressive metastatic carcinoma with or without mismatch -repair 
deficiency ( 26). The immune -related objective response rate and immune- related progression -
free survival rate were 40% (4 of 10 patients) and 78% (7 of 9 patients), respectively, for 
mismatch repair -deficient colorectal cancers and 0% (0 of 18 patients) and 11% (2 of 18  
patients) for mismatch repair -proficient colorectal cancers. The median progression -free 
survival and overall survival were not reached in the cohort with mismatch repair -deficient 
colorectal cancer but were 2.2 and 5.0 months, respectively, in the cohort  with mismatch 
repair -proficient colorectal cancer.  
Interestingly, patients with mismatch repair -deficient non -colorectal cancer had responses 
similar to those of patients with mismatch repair -deficient colorectal cancer (immune -related 
objective response  rate, 71% [5 of 7 patients]; immune -related progression -free survival rate, 
67% [4 of 6 patients]). Whole -exome sequencing revealed a mean of 1782 somatic mutations 
per tumor in mismatch repair -deficient tumors, as compared with 73 in mismatch repair -
proficient tumors (P=0.007), and high somatic mutation loads were associated with prolonged 
progression- free survival (P=0.02). Since somatic mutations have the potential to encode "non-

 self" immunogenic antigens the authors hypothesized that tumors with a lar ge number of 
somatic mutations due to mismatch -repair defects may be susceptible to immune checkpoint 
blockade.  
5.[ADDRESS_1093177] tumors  could 
identify additional patients susceptible to pembrolizumab.  
Rather than patient pre -selection, a design that incorporates all comers  (repair competent and 
deficient)  with a  stratification approach would be more suitable for preliminary evaluation of 
this concept. This approach is consistent with the evaluation by [CONTACT_535699] . for mismatch repair 
discussed above.  
5.2 Rationale for Pembrolizumab Dose Selection/Regimen   
An open- label Phase I trial (Protocol 001) evaluate d the safety and clinical activity of single 
agent pembrolizumab.  The dose escalation portion of this trial evaluated three dose levels, 1 
mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, and 10 mg/k g, administered every 2 weeks (Q2W) in subjects with advanced 
solid tumors.  All three dose levels were well tolerated and no dose -limiting toxicities were 
observed.  This first in human study of pembrolizumab showed evidence of target engagement 
and objec tive evidence of tumor size reduction at all dose levels (1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg and 10 
mg/kg Q2W).  No MTD was identified .  PK data analysis of pembrolizumab administered 
Q2W and Q3W showed slow systemic clearance, limited volume of distribution, and a long 
half-life (refer to IB).  Pharmacodynamic data (IL -2 release assay) suggested that peripheral 
target engagement is durable (>21 days).   
 
A population pharmacokinetic analysis has been performed using serum concentration time 
data from [ADDRESS_1093178] a wide therapeutic 
range based on the melanoma indication.  The differences in exposure for a 200 mg fixed dose 
regimen relative to a 2 mg/kg Q3W body weight based regimen are anticipated to remain well 
within the established exposure margins of 0.5 – 5.0 for pembrolizumab  in the melanoma 
indication. The exposure margins are based on the notion of similar efficacy and s afety in 
melanoma at 10 mg/kg Q3W vs. 2 mg/kg Q3W (i.e. 5- fold higher dose and exposure). The 
population PK evaluation revealed that there was no significant impact of tumor burden on 
exposure. In addition, exposure was similar between the NSCLC and melanoma indications. 
Therefore, there are no anticipated changes in exposure between different indication settings.  
Protocol Number: MK -3475- 663  Protocol Version Date: 20 JUL 2020  
         Protocol Versi on: 16 
9 
 It is also assumed that the dynamics of pembrolizumab target engagement will not vary 
meaningfully with tumor type.  
 
The choice of the 200 mg Q3W as an appropriate dose for the switch to fixed dosing is based 
on simulations performed using the population PK model of pembrolizumab showing that the 
fixed dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks will provide exposures that 1) are optim ally consistent 
with those obtained with the 2 mg/kg dose every 3 weeks, 2) will maintain individual patient 
exposures in the exposure range established in melanoma as associated with maximal efficacy 
response and 3) will maintain individual patients expos ure in the exposure range established 
in melanoma that are well tolerated and safe.  
A fixed dose regimen will simplify the dosing regimen to be more convenient for physicians 
and to reduce potential for dosing errors.  A fixed dosing scheme will also reduce complexity 
in the logistical chain at treatment facilities and reduce wastage.  
5.3.Rationale for Endpoints  
5.3.1 Efficacy Endpoints  
The primary efficacy endpoint is overall Immune -Related Objective Response Rate (IR-ORR) .  
Secondary efficacy endpoints will include Progression Free Survival  (PFS)  and Overall 
Survival  (OS) . 
We expect that pembrolizumab will have  a higher clinically meaningful antitumor activity , as 
measured by [CONTACT_35836] -ORR and PFS  in patients with s olid tumors with functional deficiency in the 
Fanconi Anemia (FA) pathway , compared to those with functionally competent  repair . 
Based on our prior screening data, we anticipate that close to 30% of patients with solid tumors, 
depending on tumor type wi ll be FA functionally deficient and that the response rate in these 
patients will be very similar than what was  seen for patients with mismatch repair deficient 
colorectal cancer.  The latter will not be included in this trial as we are trying to identifying 
another subset of highly responsive patients. 
5.3.2 Biomarker Research  and Correlative Endpoints  
FATSI Assessment . The main hypothesis of this trial is that pembrolizumab has clinically 
meaningful antitumor activity in solid tumor patients with functional deficiency in the Fanconi 
Anemia (FA) pathway in their tumors.  We will be performing The FATSI  assay , as previously 
described [16,17] , in archived paraffin embedded tumors  of enrolled patients  to assess for 
functional deficiency. W e hypothesize that a FATSI negative assay will be associated with a 
better response rate, that those patients able to form FANCD2 repair foci.  However, we will 
not preselect patients to this trial based on FATSI negativity. . The non- selection approach will 
avoid bias in case we observe a higher than expected rate of antit umor response or PFS in our 
treated patients  independent of FATSI  status . The results will be exploratory in nature, as there 
will not be sufficient statistical power (see Statistics Section).  
 
Protocol Number: MK -3475- 663  Protocol Version Date: 20 JUL 2020  
         Protocol Versi on: [ADDRESS_1093179] immunity can influence  the outcome of cancer 
immunotherapy  [27,28] . For example,  in several preclinical cancer models tumor pr ogression 
was controlled by [CONTACT_792975] C TLA -[ADDRESS_1093180]- spectrum  antibiotics  compromised the antitumor 
effects of CTLA -4–specific antibodies . In germ free or antibiotic -treated mice, activation of 
splenic effector CD4+ T cells and tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) induced by [CONTACT_792976] -4 was significantly decreased . Restoration  of CTLA -4 antibody activity was 
associated with oral feeding of specific pathog en isolates, compared to others. [27].  
 
In patients with melanoma, ipi[INVESTIGATOR_792963] a clustering  
algorithm from these patients to tumor bearing mice identified sizeable differences in response 
to CTLA -4 blockade . Hence, ipi[INVESTIGATOR_792964]. in the gut, which in turn affects its anticancer efficacy  [27] . 
 
Similarly, melanoma growth in mice harboring distinct commensal microbiota had  differences 
in spontaneous antitumor immunity, which were eliminated upon cohousing or after fecal 
transfer. Sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA identified Bifidobacterium as a ssociated with 
the antitumor effects. Oral administration of Bifidobacterium alone improved tumor control to 
the same degree as programmed cell death protein 1 ligand 1 (PD -L1)–specific antibo dy 
therapy , and combination treatment nearly abolished tumor out growth. Augmented dendritic 
cell function leading to enhanced CD8+ T cell priming and accumulation in the tumor 
microenvironment mediated the effect  [28] .  
 
Not only associations of specific microbiomes with antitumor  activity of immune checkpoint 
inhibito rs merit considerations, but also potentially toxicity.  A  prospective study of patients 
with metastatic melanoma undergoing ipi[INVESTIGATOR_792965] d that increased 
representation of bacteria belonging  to the Bacteroidetes phylum correlated with r esistance to 
the development of checkpoint -blockade -induced colitis [29] . 
The evidence also suggests that it is not enough to look at the microbial profile of the subject, 
but there is a need to understand what genes are expressed by [CONTACT_792977], what 
metabolites are released by [CONTACT_792978] a result of their interaction, 
and how the host genes and markers play a role in this complex web of interactions. If some 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_792966] (or poorly) on select patients, it is critical to understand the role of 
the microbiome in this process so that therapi[INVESTIGATOR_469574] n be improved, augmented, and better

to generate for the subject cohort, i.e., microbiome, metatranscriptome and metabolome.  
We will gather data in gut pathogens  from fecal samples from patients in this trial.  Our unique 
population (65% Hispanics with different ages at immigration to the [LOCATION_003]) may offer valuable 
preliminary data of potential associations to be tested in future studies as we anticipate clear 
divers ity in the microbiome of these patients, as its  composition is likely influenced by 
[CONTACT_792979].

6.4 Dose Selection/Modification  
Dose Selection  
The rationale for selection of doses to be used in this trial is provided in Section 4.0 –  
Background and Rationale.   Details on preparation and administration of pembrolizumab 
(MK -3475) are provided in the Package Insert.  
Dose Modification (Escalation/Ti tration/Other) 
Adverse events (both non- serious and serious) associated with pembrolizumab  exposure may 
represent an immunologic etiology.  These adverse events may occur shortly after the first dose 
or several months after the last dose of treatment. Pemb rolizumab must  be withheld for drug-
related  toxicities  and severe or life- threatening AEs as per Table 4  below. See Section 6.8.1  
for supportive care guidelines, including use of corticosteroids. 
Table 4. Dose Modification and Toxicity Management Guidelines for Immune -related AEs 
Associated with Pembrolizumab  
General instructions:  
1. Corticosteroid taper should be initiated upon AE improving to Grade [ADDRESS_1093198] 4 weeks.  
2. For situations where pembrolizumab has been withheld, pembrolizumab can be resumed after AE has been 
reduced to Grade 1 or 0 and corticosteroid has been tapered. Pembrolizumab should be permanently 
discontinued if AE does not resolve within 12 weeks of las t dose or corticosteroids cannot be reduced to ≤[ADDRESS_1093199] followed by [CONTACT_44874]. 
Other immunosuppressive treatment should b e initiated if irAEs cannot be controlled by [CONTACT_13216].

NOTE:  
For participants with Grade 3 or 4 immune -related endocrinopathy where withhold of pembrolizumab is 
required, pembrolizumab may be re sumed when AE resolves to ≤ Grade 2 and is controlled with hormonal 
replacement therapy or achieved metabolic control (in case of T1DM).   
 
Dosing interruptions are permitted in the case of medical / surgical events or logistical reasons 
not related to st udy therapy  (e.g., elective surgery, unrelated medical events, patient vacation, 
and/or holidays). Subjects should be placed back on study therapy within 3 weeks of the 
scheduled interruption, unless otherwise discussed with the Sponsor. The reason for 
interruption should be documented in the patient's study record.  
6.5 Timing of Dose Administration  
Trial treatment should be administered on Day 1 of each cycle after all procedures/assessments 
have been completed as detailed on the Trial Flow Chart (Section 8.0).  Trial treatment may 
be administered up to 3 days before or after the scheduled Day 1 of each cycle due to 
administrative reasons.  
All trial treatments will be administered on an outpatient basis.  
Pembrolizumab 200 mg will be administered as a 30 min ute IV infusion every 3 weeks.  Sites 
should make every effort to target infusion timing to be as close to 30 minutes as possible.  
However, given the variability of infusion pumps from site to site, a window of - 5 minutes and 
+10 minutes is permitted (i.e ., infusion time is 30 minutes: - 5 min/+10 min).  
The Package Insert  contains specific instructions for the preparation of the pembrolizumab 
infusion fluid and administration of infusion solution. 
6.6 Trial Blinding/Masking  
This is an open- label trial; therefore, the Sponsor, investigator and subject will know the 
treatment administered.  
6.7 Concomitant Medications/Vaccinations (allowed & prohibited)  
Medications or vaccinations specifically prohibited in the exclusion criteria are not allowed 
during the ongoing trial.  If there is a clinical indication for one of these or other medications 
or vaccinations specifically prohibited during the trial, discontinuation from trial therapy or 
vaccination may be required.  The investigator should discuss any questi ons regarding this 
with the [COMPANY_006] C linical team.  The final decision on any supportive therapy or vaccination 
rests with the investigator and/or the subject's primary physician.

6.7.2 Prohibited Concomitant Medications  
Subjects are prohibited from receiving the following therapi[INVESTIGATOR_80025] (including retreatment for post -complete response relapse) of this tria l: 
• Antineoplastic systemic chemotherapy or biological therapy  
• Immunotherapy not specified in this protocol  
• Chemotherapy not specified in this protocol  
• Investigational agents other than pembrolizumab  
• Radiation therapy   
o Note:  Radiation therapy to a symptomatic solitary lesion or to the brain may 
be allowed at the investigator’s discretion .   
• Live vaccines within [ADDRESS_1093203] dose of trial treatment and while 
participating in the trial.   Examples of live vac cines include, but are not limited to, the 
following: measles, mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster , yellow fever, rabies, BCG, and 
typhoid vaccine.  
• Systemic glucocorticoids for any purpose other than to modulate symptoms from an 
event of clinical interest of  suspected immunologic etiology.  The use of physiologic 
doses of corticosteroids may be approved after consultation with the Sponsor. 
Subjects who, in the assessment by [CONTACT_093], require the use of any of the 
aforementioned treatments for clinical  management should be removed from the trial.  Subjects 
may receive other medications that the investigator deems to be medically necessary.

 6.8.1 Supportive Care Guidelines  
Subjects should receive appropriate supportive care measures as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_78017].  Suggested supportive care measures for the management of adverse 
events with potential immunologic etiology are outlined below. Where appropriat e, these 
guidelines include the use of oral or intravenous treatment with corticosteroids as well as 
additional anti -inflammatory agents if symptoms do not improve with administration of 
corticosteroids.   Note that several courses of steroid tapering may be necessary as symptoms 
may worsen when the steroid dose is decreased. For each disorder, attempts should be made to 
rule out other causes such as metastatic disease or bacterial or viral infection, which might 
require additional supportive care. The  treatment guidelines are intended to be applied when 
the investigator  determines the events to be related to pembrolizumab.  
Note: if after the evaluation the event is determined not to be related, the investigator  does not 
need to follow the treatment guidanc e (as outlined below) . Refer to Section 5.2.1 for dose 
modification.  
It may be necessary to perform conditional procedures such as bronchoscopy, endoscopy, or 
skin photography as part of evaluation of the event.  
• Pneumonitis :  
o For Grade 2 events , treat with systemic corticosteroids. When symptoms improve to 
Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks.  
o For Grade 3 -4 events , immediately treat with intravenous steroids.  A dminister 
additional anti -inflammatory meas ures, as needed.  
o Add prophylactic antibiotics for opportunistic infections  in the case of prolonged steroid 
administration . 
• Diarrhea/Colitis :  
Subject s should be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of enterocolitis (such as 
diarrhea, abdominal pain, blood or mucus in stool, with or without fever) and of bowel 
perforation (such as peritoneal signs and ileus).   
o All subject s who experience diarrhea /colitis  should be advised to drink liberal quantities 
of clear fluids.  If sufficient oral fluid intake is not feasible, fluid and electrolytes should 
be substituted via IV infusion.  For Grade 2 or higher diarrhea, consider GI consultation 
and endoscopy to confirm or rule out colitis.  
o For Grade 2 diarrhea/colitis , administer oral corticosteroids.  
o For Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea/colitis , treat with intravenous steroids followed by [CONTACT_180731] .   
o When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and 
continued over no less than 4 weeks.

 • Type 1 diabetes mellitus (if new onset , including diabetic ketoacidosis [DKA] ) or ≥ 
Grade 3 Hyperglycemia, if associated with ketosis (ketonuria) or metabolic acidosis 
(DKA)  
o For T1DM  or Grade 3- 4 Hyperglycemia  
o Insulin replacement therapy is recommended for Type I diabetes mellitus and for Grade 
3-4 hyperglycemia associated with metabolic acidosis or ketonuria.  
o Evaluate patients with serum glucose and a metabolic panel, urine ketones, glycosyl ated 
hemoglobin, and C -peptide.  
• Hypophysitis : 
o For Grade 2  events, treat with corticosteroids . When symptoms improve to Grade 1 
or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks. 
Replacement of appropriate hormones may be req uired as the steroid dose is tapered.  
o For Grade 3 -4 events, treat with an initial dose of IV corticosteroids followed by 
[CONTACT_78019]. When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should 
be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks . Replacement of appropriate 
hormones may be required as the steroid dose is tapered.  
• Hyperthyroidism or Hypothyroidism :  
Thyroid disorders can occur at any time during treatment. Monitor patients for changes in 
thyroid function (at the start of treatment,  periodically during treatment, and as indicated 
based on clinical evaluation) and for clinical signs and symptoms of thyroid disorders.  
o Grade 2  hyperthyroidism events (and Grade 2- 4 hypothyroidism):  
o In hyperthyroidism, non- selective beta- blockers (e.g. propranolol) are suggested as 
initial therapy.  
o In hypothyroidism, thyroid hormone replacement therapy, with levothyroxine or 
liothyroinine, is indicated per standard of care.  
o Grade 3 -4 hyperthyroidism  
o Treat with an initial dose of IV corticosteroid follow ed by [CONTACT_78019]. When 
symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued 
over no less than 4 weeks. Replacement of appropriate hormones may be required as 
the steroid dose is tapered. 
• Hepatic : 
o For Grade 2  events, monitor liver function tests more frequently until returned to 
baseline values (consider weekly).  
o Treat with IV or oral corticosteroids  
o For Grade 3 -4 events, treat with intravenous corticosteroids for 24 to 48 hours.  
o When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or le ss, a steroid taper should be started and 
continued over no less than 4 weeks.

o For Grade 3 -4 events, t reat with systemic corticosteroids.  
o When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued 
over no less than 4 weeks.   
• Management of Infusion Reactions : Signs and symptoms usually develop during or 
shortly after drug infusion and generally resolve completely within 24 hours of completion 
of infusion. Table 5  below  shows treatment guidelines for subjects who experience an 
infusion reaction associated with administration of pembrolizumab (MK -3475).

azoospermia (whether due to having had a vasectomy or due to an underlying medical 
condition).   
Female subjects will be considered of non- reproductive potential if they are either:  
(1) postmenopausal (defined as at least 12 months with no menses without an alternative 
medical cause; in women < 45 years of age a high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level 
in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a post -menopausal state in women 
not usi ng hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy. In the absence of 12 
months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient.);  
OR  
(2) have had a hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_792967]/occlusion, at least 6 weeks prior to screening;  
OR  
(3) have  a congenital or acquired condition that prevents childbearing.  
Female and male subjects of reproductive potential must agree to avoid becoming pregnant or 
impregnating a partner, respectiv ely, while receiving study drug and for [ADDRESS_1093206] 
dose of study drug by [CONTACT_139649]:   
(1) practice abstinence† from heterosexual activity;  
OR  
(2) use (or have their partner use) acceptable contraception during heter osexual activity.   
Acceptable methods of contraception are‡: 
 Single method (one of the following is acceptable):  
• intrauterine device (IUD)  
• vasectomy of a female subject’s male partner  
• contraceptive rod implanted into the skin 
Protocol Number: MK -3475- 663  Protocol Version Date: 20 JUL 2020  
         Protocol Versi on: 16 
24 
  Combination method ( requires use of two of the following):  
• diaphragm with spermicide (cannot be used in conjunction with cervical 
cap/spermicide)  
• cervical cap with spermicide (nulliparous women only)   
• contraceptive sponge (nulliparous women only)  
• male condom or female condom (cannot be used together)  
• hormonal contraceptive: oral contraceptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382] (estrogen/progestin pi[INVESTIGATOR_64870]-
only pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]), contraceptive skin patch, vaginal contraceptive ring, or subcutaneous 
contraceptive injection  
 †Abstinence (relative  to heterosexual activity) can be used as the sole method of contraception 
if it is consistently employed as the subject’s preferred and usual lifestyle and if considered 
acceptable by [CONTACT_176742]/IRBs.  Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, 
ovulation, sympto- thermal, post -ovulation methods, etc.) and withdrawal are not acceptable 
methods of contraception.  
‡If a contraceptive method listed above is restricted by [CONTACT_427]/guidelines, then it 
does not qualify as an acceptable m ethod of contraception for subjects participating at sites in 
this country/region.  
Subjects should be informed that taking the study medication may involve unknown risks to 
the fetus (unborn baby) if pregnancy were to occur during the study.  In order to participate in 
the study subjects of childbearing potential must adhere to the contraception requirement 
(described above) from the day of study medication initiation (or 14 days prior to the initiation 
of study medication for oral contraception) throughout  the study period up to [ADDRESS_1093207]’s status until the  pregnancy has been completed or 
terminated.  The outcome of the pregnancy will be reported to the Sponsor and to [COMPANY_006] 
without delay and within 24 hours  to the Sponsor and within 2 working days to [COMPANY_006] if the 
outcome is a serious adverse experience (e.g., death, abortion, congenital anomaly, or other 
disabling or life -threatening complication to the mother or newborn).   
The study investigator will make every effort to obtain permission to follow the outcome of 
the pregnancy and report the condition of the fetus or newborn to the Sponsor.   If a male 
subject impregnates his female partner the study personnel at the site must be informed 
immediately and the pregnancy reported to the Sponsor and to [COMPANY_006] a nd followed as 
described above.

Subjects may withdraw consent at any time for any reason or be dropped from the trial at the 
discretion of the investigator should any untoward effec t occur.  In addition, a subject may be 
withdrawn by [CONTACT_80074], the 
trial plan is violated, or for administrative and/or other safety reasons.   
A subject must be discontinued from the tri al for any of the following reasons:  
• The subject or legal representative (such as a parent or legal guardian) withdraws consent.  
• Confirmed radiographic disease progression 
• Unacceptable adverse experiences  
• Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment  
• Investigator’s decision to withdraw the subject  
• The subject has a confirmed positive serum pregnancy test  
• Noncompliance with trial treatment or procedure requirements  
• The subject is lost to follow -up 
• Completed 24 months of unint errupted treatment with pembrolizumab or 35 
administrations of study medication, whichever is later.  
• Administrative reasons  
The End of Treatment and Follow -up visit procedures are listed in Section 8 (Protocol  Flow 
Chart) and Section 10.0.1 (Visit Requirements).  After the end of treatment, each subject will 
be followed for 30 days for adverse event monitoring (serious adverse events will be collected 
for 90 days after the end of treatment).  Subjects who discontinue for reasons other than 
progressive disease will have post -treatment follow -up for disease status until disease 
progression, initiating a non- study cancer treatment, withdrawing consent or becoming lost to 
follow -up.  After documented disease progression each subject will be followed by [CONTACT_559416], withdrawal of consent, or the end of the study, whichever 
occurs first.

 9.0 TRIAL PROCEDURES  
The Trial Flow Chart -  Section 8.0 summarizes the trial procedures to be performed at each 
visit.  Individual trial procedures are described in detail below.  It may be necessary to perform 
these procedures at unscheduled time points if deemed clinically necessary by [CONTACT_093].  
Furthermore, additional evaluations/testing may be deemed necessary by [CONTACT_112102]/or 
[COMPANY_006] for reasons related to subject safety. In some cases, such evaluation/testing may be 
potentially sensitive in nature (e.g., HIV, Hepatitis C, etc.), and thus local regulations may 
require that additional informed consent be obtained from the subject.  In these cases, such 
evaluations/testing will be performed in accordance with those regulations.  
9.0.1 Administrative Procedures  
[IP_ADDRESS] Informed Consent  
The Investigator must obtain documented consent from each potential subject prior to 
participating in a clinical trial. 
Consent must be documented by [CONTACT_423]’s dated signature [INVESTIGATOR_4388] [CONTACT_423]’s legally 
acceptable representative’s dated signature [INVESTIGATOR_2394] a consent form along with the dated signature 
[CONTACT_63564].  
A copy of the signed and dated consent form should be given to the subject before participation 
in the trial.  
The initial informed consent form, any subsequent revised written informed consent form and 
any written information provided to the subject must receive the IRB/ERC’s 
approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_19349].  The subject or his/her legally acceptable 
representative should be informed in a timely manner if new information becomes available 
that may be relevant to the subject’s willingness to continue participation in th e trial.  The 
communication of this information will be provided and documented via a revised consent 
form or addendum to the original consent form that captures the subject’s dated signature [CONTACT_90096] [CONTACT_423]’s legally acceptable representative’s dated si gnature.  
Specifics about a trial and the trial population will be added to the consent form template at 
the protocol level.   
The informed consent will adhere to IRB/ERC requirements, applicable laws and regulations 
and Sponsor requirements. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria  
All inclusion and exclusion criteria will be reviewed by [CONTACT_26358].  
[IP_ADDRESS] Medical History  
A medical history will be obtained by [CONTACT_27404] .  Medical history 
will include all active conditions, and any condition diagnosed within the prior 10 years that 
are considered to be clinically significant by [CONTACT_737].  Details regarding the disease for

[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_1093217] 
during the trial.  All medications related to reportable SAEs and ECIs should be recorded as 
defined in Section 9.2.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Disease Details and Treatments  
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Disease Details  
The investigator or qualified designee will obtain prior and current details regarding disease 
status.   
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Prior Treatment Details  
The investigator or qualified designee will review all prior cancer treatments including 
systemic treatments, radiation and surg eries.  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_1093218] will 
move into survival follow -up.  
9.0.2 Clinical Procedures/Assessments  
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event  (AE) Monitoring  
The investigator or qualified designee will assess each subject to evaluate for potential new or 
worsening AEs as specified in the Trial Flow Chart and more frequently if clinically indicated.  
Adverse experiences will be graded and record ed throughout the study and during the follow -
up period according to NCI CTCAE Version 4.0 (see Section 11.2 ).  Toxicities will be 
characterized in terms regarding seriousness, causality, toxicity grading, and action taken with 
regard to trial treatment.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Full Physical Exam  
The investigator or qualified designee will perform a complete physical exam during the 
screening period.  Clinically significant abnormal findings should be recorded as medical 
history.  A full physical exam should be performed during s creening,  
Protocol Number: MK -3475- 663      Protocol Version Date: 27 JUN 2019  
       Protocol Version: 15 
 
31 
 [IP_ADDRESS] Directed Physical Exam  
For cycles that do not require a full physical exam per the Trial Flow Chart, the investigator or 
qualified designee will perform a directed physical exam as clinically indicated prior to trial 
treatment administration.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Vital Signs  
The investigator or qualified designee will take vital signs at screening, prior to the 
administration of each dose of trial treatment and at treatment discontinuation as specified in 
the Trial Flow Chart (Section 8 ).  Vital signs should include temperature, pulse, respi[INVESTIGATOR_862], weight and blood pressure.  Height will be measured at screening only. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Scale  
The investigator or qualified designee will assess ECOG status (see below ) at screeni ng, prior 
to the administration of each dose of trial treatment and discontinuation of trial treatment as 
specified in the Trial Flow Chart.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Tumor Imaging and Assessment of Disease  
Tumor assessments will be performed by [CONTACT_686940]  (CT)  or Magnetic 
Resonance Imaging (MRI) . Measurable disease will be required by [CONTACT_792984] [ADDRESS_1093219] Scans 
or MRI ’s will be repeated every 2 cycles (3 weeks cycles); that is before every third dose of 
pembrolizumab in order to assess response to therapy.  Tumor imaging will only be required 
every [ADDRESS_1093220] been  on treatment for more than 1 year. Immune -related 
Response Criteria (irRC)  [30] will be utilized for assessment of response to therapy .  
Systematic criteria designated immune -related response criteria were defined based on four 
distinct response patterns seen after administration of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_226139]: (a) shrinkage in baseline 
lesions, without new lesions; (b) durable stable disease (in some patients followed by a slow, 
steady decline in total tumor burden); (c) response after an increase in total tumor burden; a nd 
(d) response in the presence of new lesions.  These four patterns were associated with favorable 
survival [30].  
For the irRC index and measurable new lesions are taken into account to calculate evolving 
tumor burden.  At baseline, the sum of the product s of the two largest perpendicular diameters 
(SPD) of all index lesions (five lesions per organ, up to 10 visceral lesions) is calculated. At 
each subsequent tumor assessment, the SPD of the index lesions and of new, measurable 
lesions (up to 5 new lesions  per orga n; 10 visceral lesions) are added together to provide the 
total tumor burden.  A comparison of the use of SPD in WHO criteria versus the use of tumor 
burden in irRC is presented in Table 8.

index l esions.  50% decrease in tumor burden 
compared with baseline cannot be

compared with nadir.  
PD At least 25% increase in SPD 
compared with nadir and/or 
unequivocal progression of non -
index lesions and/or appearance of 
new lesions (at any single time 
point).  At least 25% increase in tumor 
burden compared with nadir (at 
any single time point) in two 
consecutive observations at least 4 
weeks apart.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Overall response using the irRC  
• irCR : Complete disappearance of all lesions ( whether measurable or not, and no new 
lesions) confirmed by a repeat, consecutive assessment no less than [ADDRESS_1093222] documented.  
• Ir PR : Decrease in tumor burden ≥ 50% relative to baseline confirmed by a consecutive 
assessment at least [ADDRESS_1093223] documentation. 
• irSD : Not meeting criteria for irCR or irPR, in absence of irPD . 
• irPD : Increase in tumor burden ≥25% relative to nadir (minimum recorded tumor 
burden) confirmed by a repeat, consecutive assessment no less than [ADDRESS_1093224] documented.  
Major differences with other tumor response criteria include: PR or SD in the presence of new 
lesions, as long as they met the respective threshold of response based on total differences in 
tumor burden; an SD does not require confirmation ; however PD requires confirmation by 
[CONTACT_792985] 4 weeks apart in the absence of rapid clinical deterioration.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Tumor Tissue Collection and Correlative Studies Sampling  
We will evaluate functionality of the Fanconi Anemia pathway in p atient tumor samples. 
Formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) will be obtained from patients participating in the 
trial.  The presence of archival tumor material  is part of the criteria for eligibility for this trial. 
FFPE tumor tissue will be cut at 4 mic rons, placed on positively charged slides and stained

 with hematoxylin and eosin (HE).  Additional sections for FATSI staining will be placed in a 
60°C oven for [ADDRESS_1093225] fashion.  Antigen retrieval will be performed by [CONTACT_792986]’s TRS (pH 6.1) antigen retrieval solution (Dako, Carpenteria, CA) in a calibrated 
vegetable steamer (Black and Decker).  Slides then will be placed on a Dako Autostainer for 
automated staining. The tissue sections will be incubated with a primary antibody cocktail of 
rabbit polyclonal FANC -D2 antibody at a dilution of 1:1000 and a monoclonal anti -Ki67 
mouse antibody at a dilution of 1: 150, and incubated for 1 hour at room  temperature.  Sections 
then will be co -incubated with a secondary antibody (FITC conjugated to anti -rabbit IgG and 
Alexafluor 594 donkey anti -mouse) at 1:[ADDRESS_1093226].  The sections will be mounted on 
glass slides using a 4’ 6 -diamidino -2-phenylindole (DAPI) –containing embedding medium 
(Vysis Dapi 1, Abbott Laboratories, Downers Grove, IL).  FANCD2 foci positive and negative 
cell lines (MCF -7 and PD20 cells) us ed as controls will be included on the sample slide during 
the procedure.  The slides will be analyzed under a Nikon E -400 fluorescence microscope.  
Circulating cell- free tumor DNA (ctDNA) carries comprehensive, inherently specific, and 
highly sensitive inf ormation.  Studies in melanoma, breast, ovarian, and colon cancers have 
validated the potential applications of ctDNA to monitor tumor burden dynamically and 
precisely during treatment process. A liquid biopsy based on ctDNA could capture the entire 
hetero geneity of the disease longitudinally as well as in real time.  Blood samples collected 
from the patients will be sent to [LOCATION_012] International University (Duan’s lab)  for genomic 
analysis.  
All analyses regarding the microbiome will be performed by [CONTACT_792987].  
The four “omics” profiles mentioned above will be processed using integrative analysis 
techniques developed by [CONTACT_792988].  In 
particular, the method of heterogeneous correlation networks  will help identify groups of 
entities from different omics data that tend to occur together or avoid each other. Groups of 
entities from the metagenome, metatranscriptome, metabolome and patient transcriptome will 
help generate useful hypotheses for further investigations. Using the functional annotations of 
the genes, it is possible to determine which microbial taxa are responsible for the functional 
genes of interest that are most differentially expressed. The analysis will also implicate the 
most releva nt human pathways of interest. Using the KEGG metabolic pathways database, it 
is possible to hypothesize which microbial taxa are responsible for the most differentially 
abundant metabolites.

 10.0 Withdrawal/Discontinuation  
When a subject discontinues/withdraws prior to trial completion, all applicable activities 
scheduled for the final trial visit should be performed at the time of disco ntinuation.  Any 
adverse events, which are present at the time of discontinuation/withdrawal should be followed 
in accordance with the safety requirements outlined in Section 11 - Assessing and Recording 
Adverse Events.  Subjects who a) attain a  CR or b) complete 24 months of treatment with 
pembrolizumab may discontinue treatment with the option of restarting treatment if they meet 
the criteria specified in Section 7.1.  After discontinuing treatment following assessment of 
CR, these subjects should return to the site for a Safety Follow -up Visit (described in Section 
[IP_ADDRESS]) and then proceed to the Follow -Up Period of the study (described in Section 
[IP_ADDRESS]).  
10.0.1 Visit Requirements  
Visit requirements are outlined in Section 8.0 - Trial Flow Chart.   Specific procedure -related 
details are provided above in Section 9 -  Trial Pr ocedures.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Safety Follow -Up Visit  
The mandatory Safety Follow -Up Visit should be conducted approximately [ADDRESS_1093227].  All AEs that oc cur prior to the Safety Follow -Up Visit should be recorded.  
Subjects with an AE of Grade > [ADDRESS_1093228].  SAEs that occur 
within 90 days of the end of treatment or before initiation of a new anti -cancer  treatment should 
also be followed and recorded.   
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Follow -up Visits  
Subjects who discontinue trial treatment for a reason other than disease progression will move 
into t he Follow -Up Phase and should be assessed every 6 weeks ( 42 ± 7 days) by [CONTACT_165919].  After 1 year, the imaging time point will occur every 9 
weeks (± 7 days).  Every effort should be made to collect information regarding disease status 
until the start of new anti -neoplastic therapy, disease progression, death, or end of the study  
Information regarding post -study anti -neoplastic treatment will be collected if new treatment 
is initiated.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Survival Follow -up 
Once a subject experiences confirmed disease progression or starts a new anti -cancer  therapy, 
the subject moves into the survival follow -up phase and should be contact[CONTACT_588822] [ADDRESS_1093229] a causal relationship with this treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any

 unfavorable  and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol -
specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol -
specified procedure.  Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in 
frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition that is temporally associ ated with the use 
of pembrolizumab is also an adverse ev ent. 
Progression of the cancer under study is not considered an adverse event .  
All adverse events that occur after the consent form is signed but before treatment 
allocation/randomization must be reported by [CONTACT_792989] b e 
excluded from the trial, or are the result of a protocol -specified intervention, including but not 
limited to washout or discontinuation of usual therapy, diet, placebo treatment or a procedure.  
From the time of treatment allocation/randomization through  [ADDRESS_1093230] be reported by [CONTACT_093]. Such events will be 
recorded at each examination on the Adverse Event case report forms/worksheets.  The 
investigator will make every attempt to follow all subjects with non- serious adverse events 
for outcome.  
11.0.1 Definition of an Overdose for This Protocol and Reporting of Overdose to the 
Sponsor and to [COMPANY_006]  
For purposes of this trial, an overdose of pembrolizumab will be defined as any dose of 1,000 
mg or grea ter (≥5 times the indicated dose).  No specific information is available on the 
treatment of overdose of pembrolizumab. Appropriate supportive treatment should be provided 
if clinically indicated.  In the event of overdose, the subject should be observed closely for signs 
of toxicity.   
If an adverse event(s)  is associated with (“results from”) the overdose of pembrolizumab , the 
adverse event(s) is reported as a serious adverse event, even if no othe r seriousness criteria are 
met. 
If a dose of pembrolizumab meeting the protocol definition of overdose is taken without any 
associated clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory results, the overdose is reported as a non-
serious Event of Clinical Interest (E CI), using the terminology “accidental or intentional 
overdose without adverse effect.”  
All reports of overdose with and without an adverse event must be reported within 24 hours to 
the Sponsor and within 2 working days  hours to [COMPANY_006]  Global Safety . (Attn: Worldwide 
Product Safety; FAX 215 993- 1220)

 Pregnancies and lactations that occur after the consent form is signed but before treatment 
allocation/randomization must be reported by [CONTACT_792990] y cause the subject to be 
excluded from the trial, or are the result of a protocol -specified intervention, including but not 
limited to washout or discontinuation of usual therapy, diet, placebo treatment or a procedure.   
Pregnancies and lactations that o ccur from the time of treatment allocation/randomization 
through 120 days following cessation of Sponsor’s product, or [ADDRESS_1093232] be followed to the completion/termination 
of the pregnancy. Pregnancy outcomes of spontaneous abortion, missed abortion, benign 
hydatidiform mole, blighted ovum, fetal death, intrauterine death, miscarriage and s tillbirth 
must be reported as serious events (Important Medical Events). If the pregnancy continues to 
term, the outcome (health of infant) must also be reported.  
Such events must be reported within 24 hours to the Sponsor and within 2 working days to 
[COMPANY_006] Global Safety. (Attn: Worldwide Product Safety; FAX 215 993- 1220)  
11.0.3 Immediate Reporting of Adverse Events to the Sponsor and to [COMPANY_006]  
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event is any adverse event occurring at any dose or during any use of 
[COMPANY_006] ’s product that:  
• Results in death;  
• Is life threatening;  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity;  
• Results in or prolongs an existing inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059];  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect;

All Adverse Events will be reported to regulatory authorities, IRB/IECs and investigators in 
accordance with all applicable global laws and regulations.

to mis match repair  deficient patients , the immune -related objective response will be at or above 
40% in patients with functional FA def iciency  (FATSI negative) , and less than 10% in patients 
without either homologous recombination repair deficiency or mismatch repair deficiency. 
Patients with mismatch repair deficiency will be excluded from this trial. Based on our prior 
screening data, w e anticipate that close to 30% of patients with solid tumors, depending on 
tumor type will be FA functionally deficient.  
We will utilize a two -stage phase II trial design to detect an iORR of at least 20% in the whole 
population  tested vs. the null hypothesis that the true iORR is at most 5%, representing a 
response by [CONTACT_29745], or other infrequent unknown mechanism. Specifically, we will test 
the null hypothesis H 0: iORR ≤ 5% vs. H 1: iORR ≥ 20% with 90% power and a Type I error 
rate of 10%. The altern ative hypothesis of 20% iORR represents a weighted average of the 
anticipated 40% response in FATSI -negative patients and 10% response in FATSI -positive, 
assuming a [ADDRESS_1093244] stage enrollment and thus a higher expected number of FATSI -
negative patients in the interim analysis. Total enrollment of 39 patients is only slightly greater 
than that of the Simon designs but has the advantage of increasing the expected number of 
FATSI -negative patients. Additionally, the proposed design has a higher early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_792968]. The following table summarizes these operating 
characteristics.

 We will analyze the paraffin embedded tumors of the participating patients for FA functional 
deficiency. Analysis will be conducted in batches.   
 
We will report the 90% confidence interval estimates of iORR both overall and by [CONTACT_792991] (Clopper -Pearson). We note, however, that the planned study is 
too small for a well- powered comparison given that we expect only 12 FATSI -negative 
patients. Instead, variation in iORR by [CONTACT_792992] -
sided 95% lower confidence limit (95%LCL) for the difference. The following table illustrates 
the 95%LCL for several possible study outcomes in which iORR is higher in FATSI - patients. 
Taking the second rows as an example, an observed increase in iORR for FATSI -negative 
patients of 34.3%, based on 5 out of 12 FATSI - responders compared with 2 out of 27 FATSI+ 
responders, provides 95% confidence that the true increase for patients with FA deficient 
tumors is at least 9.4%, suggesting that further study of Pembrolizu mab in FA deficient patients 
is warranted.

and immune -related  progression -free survival (iPFS). Point estimates and 2 -sided 95% 
confidence intervals will be reported for selected times using Greenwood’s variance and the 
log-log transform method. This will include the 20- week iPFS for purposes of comparison with 
the literature.  
12.1 Expansion Cohort  
At the conclusion of the accrual as specified above, an expanded cohort of 10 patients with the 
diagnosis of metastatic or recurrent endometrial carcinoma or endometrial sarcoma will be 
enrolled. These patients need tissue  availability and documentation of microsatellite low or 
stable. (see Section 6.1.1 for inclusion/exclusion criteria).  All clinical benefit measure 
parameters and correlatives will be obtained, as per the other patient.  No additional statistical 
inferences, other than comparison between FATSI positives and negatives in terms of clinical

clinical trial.  
The Quality Assurance (QA) division in the Miami Cancer Institute Clinical Trials Office is 
responsible for ensuring that industry standards of quality are met and exceeded on an on-
going b asis.  The division is responsible for the identification, management, and prevention of 
quality issues, reviewing subject research charts, and mappi[INVESTIGATOR_792970]. They 
develop and implement quality and verification checks, including necessary a ssessment tools 
and checklists used during the QC process. Moreover, they facilitate and advi ce on corrections 
and corrective and preventive actions related to quality issues, provide guidance on 
interpretation and application of regulations, manage FDA and sponsor site visits, and work 
with site manager to create, implement, and evaluate action plans.  
17.[ADDRESS_1093257] into data. 
All steps involved in data management should be documented in order to allow step- by-step 
retrospective assessment of quality of the data and the performance of the clinical trial (the 
“audit paper trail” concept). Documentation is facilitated by [CONTACT_792997] -
lists and forms giving details of action taken, dates, the individuals responsible, etc.  
In the event of electronic data handling, confidentiality of the database must be secured by 
[CONTACT_792998]. Provision 
must be made for the satisfactory maintenance of the database and for back -up procedures.  
17.1 Responsibilities  of the investigator  
a)  The investigator has overall responsibility for ensuring the accuracy and completeness 
of data entry. The investigator must ensure that the observations and findings are recorded 
correctly and completely in the case- report forms (CRFs) and signed by [CONTACT_792999]. When conducting a study and using CRFs to report clinical trial 
data to the sponsor, the investigator must also ensure that the routine requirements for 
recording of data in the source  documents (e.g. hospi[INVESTIGATOR_792971], consultation 
files) are met, particularly those relating to the treatment given to the subject and adverse 
events.  
b)  If trial data are entered directly into a computer, there must always be an adequate safeguard 
to ensure validation, including a signed and dated print -out and back- up records. Computerized 
systems should be validated and a detailed description for their use be produced and kept up-
to-date.

 Protocol Version Date: 27 JUN 2019  
            
 Protocol Version: 15 
 
51 
 c)  All corrections to CRFs and to raw data must be  made in a way which does not obscure the 
original entry. The correct data must be inserted with the reason for the correction (if not 
obvious), the date, and the initials of the investigator or authorized person. For electronic data 
processing, only authorized persons should be permitted to enter or modify data in the 
computer and there should be a record of changes and deletions. If data are altered during 
processing, the alteration must be documented.  
d)  Laboratory values with normal reference ranges, p referably together with the specificity 
and sensitivity of the methods used, should always be recorded on the CRF or be attached to 
it. Values outside a clinically accepted reference range or values that differ significantly from 
previous values must be evaluated and commented upon by [CONTACT_093]. 
e)  Data other than those required by [CONTACT_793000], provided they are 
clearly marked as additional or optional findings, with an explanation of their significance.  
f)  Units of measureme nt must always be stated, and conversion of units must always 
be indicated and documented. 
g)  The final report of the trial should be drawn up as defined in the protocol. The report should 
be signed by [CONTACT_456], monitor and investigator(s) as well as t he responsible statistician, in 
accordance with the applicable regulations.  
h)  For a period of time defined by [CONTACT_2091], the investigator should maintain a 
confidential record to allow the translation of the unambiguous code used to conceal the 
identity of the individual subjects in the trial (subject identification code). The investigator 
may submit the subject identification code list to the drug regulatory authority after the trial, 
together with the final report, according to national regul ations.

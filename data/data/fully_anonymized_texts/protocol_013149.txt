STUDY SYNOPSIS
Protocol num ber:  SHP621 -302 Drug: SHP621, oral budesonide s uspension (OBS )
Title of the study: A Phase 3, Multicenter, Double -blind Extension Study to Evaluate Maintenance of 
Efficacy of Oral Budesonide Suspension (OBS ) and Long -term Treatm ent Effect of OBS in 
Adolescent and Adult Subjects (11 to 55 Years of Age, Inclusive) with Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE)
Number of subjects (total and for each treatm ent arm):
Approximately 200 subjects (88%) who are randomized in the SHP621 -301 study are estimated to 
complete the SHP621 -301 study and enroll in this treatment extension study based on enrollment 
observed in the Phase 2 study (MPI 101 -06).
Investigator(s):   Multicenter study
Site(s) and Region(s): 
Approximately 60sites in North Am erica
Study period (planned):
April 2016 –April 2019Clinical phase: 3
Objectives
Primary:
To evaluate the maintenance of efficacy over 36 weeks, as measured by [CONTACT_64673] (DSQ) score, through a randomized withdraw al 
design for subjects who responded to 12 weeks of OBS treatment (2mg twice daily) with a peak 
count of ≤6 eosinophils (eos)/high -powered field (HPF) across all available esophageal levels at 
the final treatment visit and a ≥30% reduction in DSQ score from baseline during the SHP621 -301 
induction study
Key Secondary:
To evaluate the long-term treatm ent respo nse over an extended period of 36 weeks for subjects 
who were random ized to OBS treatment but did not respond after 12 weeks in the SHP621 -301 
induction study (subject did not have a peak count of ≤6 eos/HPF across all available esophageal 
levels at the fi nal treatment visit and/or a ≥30% reduction in DSQ score from baseline )
Secondary:
To evaluate the response to OBS treatment over 36 weeks for subjects who received placebo in 
the SHP621 -301 induction study
To evaluate the effect of reinitiating OBS treatm ent for subjects who relapse after being 
randomized to placebo in the randomized withdraw al period (treatment -withdrawal -treatm ent 
reinitiation)
To assess endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_64613] (EREF S)
To evaluate other respon secriteria based on histology and DSQ
To evaluate the long -term safety and tolerability of OBS treatment

Rationale:
Currently there is no approved medication for the treatment of EoE. This Phase [ADDRESS_70030], dose, and m ode of administration :
The assessments from the SHP621- 301 final treatment evaluation visit (Visit 4) will be used as the 
screening assessments (Visit 0) of this treatment extension study. At the SHP621 -[ADDRESS_70031] (based on treatment 
assignment in SHP621- 301) that will last for up to 4 weeks prior toenrolling into this treatment 
extension study. A 4-week screening period is required to allow  for blinded treatment response 
information (reduction in DSQ from baseline and eosinophilic count as determined by a central reader) 
collected during the SHP621 -301 final treatment evaluation visit to be entered into the interactive web-
based response system (IWRS) by [CONTACT_64674]-to-day conduct of the study . Once information is available, 
subjects will return for the random ization visit (Visit 1) to receive investigational product as follows:
Subjects who were assigned to OBS treatment and who fully responded in the SHP621 -301 study 
(≤6 eos/HPF across all available esophageal levels and at least a 30% reduction in DSQ at the 
final treatment evaluation visit) will enter a randomized withdraw al period to receive either OBS 
2mg twice daily or placebo at a 1:1 ratio
Subjects who were assigned to OBS treatment and did not respond orpartially responded to OBS 
treatment in the SHP621 -301 study will receive OBS 2 mg twice daily
Subjects who were assigned to placebo in the SHP621 -[ADDRESS_70032] DSQ data from theSHP621 -301 study (post
randomization) and this extension study until database lock occurs for this extension study.  
During the 36-week double- blind treatme nt extension study, subjects will receive oral administration 
of 10 mL of 0.2mg/mL (2 mg) investigational product twice daily (every morning [qAM] after meals 
[breakfast, pc] and at bedtime [hs]; 4 mg total/day ), with no ingestion of food or liquids permitted for 
30minutes after investigational product administration . Dosing regim ens are consistent with the 
regimens used in the Phase 2 MPI 101 -06 stu dy and Phase 3 SHP621 -301 study :
Placebo twice daily group:  placebo qAM (pc) and hs
OBS twice daily group: OBS 10 mL of 0.2 mg/mL (2 mg) qAM (pc) and hs (4mg OBS total/day)
The investigational product will be supplied in am ber glass, multidose bottles with child -resistant caps
and refrigerated throughout the study (in the clinic and subject’s home). Each bottle will contain 
approximately 210 mL of suspension with a budesonide concentration of 0.2 mg/mL, or 0.00 mg/mL 
(matching placebo). 
The total daily dose of budesonide will be [ADDRESS_70033] in the OBS t reatment group ( Total Daily Dose of OBS ).

At Week 12, all subjects will undergo an upper esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with biopsy to 
evaluate eosin ophil counts. Upon receipt of blinded EGD and DSQ data, subjects on placebo in the 
randomized withdraw al period who have relapsed will have their treatment assignment changed to 
OBS 2 mg twice daily . The criteria for relapse is having an eosinophilic count of ≥15 eos/ HPF from at 
least [ADDRESS_70034] 
8diary entries over 14 consecutive days; however, the 2-week period will not be shifted by [CONTACT_726] 
2weeks (ie, no m ore than 2 -week period plus additional 2 -week additional expansion) . The criteria for 
relapse align with the related inclusion criteria for participation in the SHP621 -[ADDRESS_70035]’s treatment 
assignment to OBS 2 mg twice daily if relapse is confirmed.
If the Week 12 or an unscheduled EGD reveal san eosinophil count of ≥[ADDRESS_70036]’s treatment assignment 
will be changed to OBS 2 mg tw ice daily at the next scheduled visit.
Methodology:
This is a Phase 3, double -blind, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of 
twice daily administration of OBS (qAM, pc,and hs) in adolescents and adults aged 11-55 years, 
inclusive, with EoE and dysphagia who completed the SHP621 -301 induction study . 
This study will comprise 3 periods: 4-weekscreening period , 36-week double -blind treatment period , 
and a 4-week safety follow -up(Study Design Flow Chart ). All subjects who have completed the 
SHP621 -301 induction study will be eligible to enroll in this extension study. Approximately 
200subjects (88%) who were randomized in the SHP621 -301 study are estimated to complete the 
SHP621 -301 study and will be enrolled in this treatment extension study based on enrollment observed 
in the Phase 2 study (MPI 101-06). Randomization into the random ized withdrawal period will be 
stratified by [CONTACT_64675]621 -301 study. Subjects who are 
full responders (defined as ≤6 eos/HPF across all available esophageal levels and at least a 30% 
reduction in DSQ at the final treatment evaluation visit [Visit 4]) in the SHP621 -301 induction study 
will be eligible to enter the randomized withdrawal period to receive either OBS 2 mg twice daily or

placebo at a 1:1 ratio. The randomization of subjects who are full responders will also be stratified by 
[CONTACT_654] (adults and adolescents) to ensure approximately equal number of subjects within each age group
areassigned to the treatment groups .
Subjects who sign informed consent (or assent as applicable for subjects <18years) will be screened 
(Visit 0) ; assessments from the SHP621 -301 final treatment evaluation visit (Visit 4) will be used as 
the Visit 0screening assessments of the treatment extension study . Subjects who meet eligibility 
criteria at the screening visit (Visit 0) will enter the [ADDRESS_70037] based on treatment assignment in SHP621 -301 for up to 4 weeks prior 
to enrollment in the treatmen t extension study. This 4-week screening period is required to allow  for 
blinded treatment response inform ation (reduction in DSQ from baseline and eosinophilic count as 
determined by a central reader) collected during the SHP621 -[ADDRESS_70038] of the study .Once information is available, subjects will 
return for the randomization visit (Visit 1 ) to receive investigational prod uct.
During the 36-week treatment extension study, subjects who were assigned to, and fully responded to 
OBS treatment in the SHP621 -301 study (≤6eos/HPF across all available esophageal levels and at 
least a 30% reduction in DSQ at the final treatment evaluation visit) will enter a randomized 
withdrawal period to receive either OBS 2mg twice daily or placebo at a 1:1 ratio. Subjects who were 
assigned to OBS treatment in the SHP621 -301 study and did not respond or partially responded , will 
receive OBS 2mgtwice daily . Subjects who were assigned to placebo in the SHP621 -301 study will 
receive OBS 2mg twice daily . At Week 12, all subjects will undergo an upper 
esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with biopsy to evaluate eosinophil counts. Upon receipt of 
blinde d EGD and DSQ data, subjects on placebo in the randomized withdrawal period who have 
relapsed (>15 eos/HPF from at least 2 levels of the esophagus and specimens and4 days of dysphagia 
over 2weeks) will have their treatment assignment changed to OBS [ADDRESS_70039]’s treatment assignment to OBS [ADDRESS_70040].

Statistical Methodology for Prim ary Efficacy Endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint will be analyzed asthe proportion of subjects withrelapse during the 
end ofthe double -blind randomized withdraw al period for the FAS, using a chi-square test comparing 
OBS [ADDRESS_70055] will be two-sided, and 
conducted at the significance level of 0.05. Theproportion of subjects with relapse for each treatment 
group and the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) will be estimated. In addition, the 
difference in the proportion of subjects with relapse between the 2treatment groups and its 95% CI 
will be estimated.
Subjects who withdraw without providing efficacy data at the early termination (ET) visit will be 
classified asbeing a relapser in the primary efficacy analysis. The null hypothesis states that there is 
no difference in relapse proportions between OBS [ADDRESS_70056] to the observed data at each double-
blind visit.

Statistical Methodology for Safety Endpoints 
All safety measures, including AEs, physical examination, stadiometry, vital signs (temperature, 
systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]), w eight and height assessments, DXA 
scans for BMD and body composition measurements (for adolescents aged 11-17 years, inclusive), 
clinical laboratory results (hematology, chemistry, urinalysis; serum pregnancy test, if appropriate), 
and ACTH stimulation will be descriptively summarized by [CONTACT_64679].
The number and percent of subjects with TEAEs will be presented. TEAEs are defined as AEs that 
start or deteriorate on or after the date of the first dose of investigational product (Visit 1) and no later 
than 3days following the last dose of investi gational product. However, for any subjects who die 
during the study (ie, the date of death is betw een the date of first dose of investigational product and 
the date of study discontinuation entered by [CONTACT_779], inclusive), all AEs (including those resulti ng in 
death) that occur during the study will be considered as TEAEs irrespective of the last dose and will be 
included in the TEAE summaries. 
Sample Size Justification
Approximately 200 subjects (88%) who are randomized in the SHP621 -301 study are estima ted to 
complete the SHP621 -301 study and enroll in this treatment extension study based on enrollment 
observed in the Phase 2 study (MPI 101 -06).
The primary efficacy measure of the study will be the proportion of subjects who relapse during the 
double- blind randomized withdraw al period . Relapse , a binary response (either with relapse or not), is 
defined as having an eosinophil count of ≥15eos/HPF from at least 2 of 3 levels of the esophagus 
(determined by a central reader) and having at least 4 days of dy sphagia in a 2 -week period prior to the 
scheduled visit (determined by [CONTACT_64676]) . To be considered as a subject w ith relapse, both criteria must 
be met.
Based on observation in the Phase 2 study (MPI 101-06), approximately 26% of subjects, or 
approximately [ADDRESS_70057] a 50 percentage point difference between relapse proportions of 20% and 70% 
in the OBS and placebo groups, respectively, at 80% power and a significance level of 0.05 
(two-sided) using a Chi-Square test with equal allocation to treatment groups, it is necessary to assess 
the prim ary efficacy measure for approximately 38 subjects (19 subjects in each of the OBS and 
placebo groups).

1. BACKGROUND INFORMATI ON
1.1 Indication and Current Treatment Options 
Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is defined as “a chronic, immune/antigen -mediated eso phageal 
disease characterized clinically  by [CONTACT_64681]- predominant inflammation” (Liacouras et al., 2011). Clinical 
symptoms of EoE often vary by[CONTACT_654]: Infants and toddlers present with feeding difficulties; 
school -aged children are more likely  to present with vomiting or pain; and adolescents and 
adults present with dysphagia and food impaction. When these symptoms are present, the 
diagnosis is confirmed by  [CONTACT_64682] ≥15 eosinophils/high- power ed
field (HPF) on at least 1 esophageal biopsy  and when other causes such as proton pump 
inhibitor (PPI)-responsive esophageal eosinophilia are excluded ( Dellon et al., 2014a ; Furuta 
et al., 2007 ).The standards of care are diet therapi[INVESTIGATOR_64617] -label use of glucocorticosteroids.
Esophageal dilation is used to temporarily  relieve symptoms but does not address underl ying 
inflammation. Given the clinical outcomes associated with EoE, including severe dysphagia, 
esophageal stricture, food impaction, and esophageal perforation (Hirano and Aceves , 2014
;
Liacouras et al., 2011 ) and the fact that there are currentl y no FDA -approved treatments, there 
is a clear unmet medical need for an approved treatment that induces and maintains remission
for patients with EoE ( Furuta and Katzka, 2015 ).  
1.[ADDRESS_70063] Background and Clinical Information
Oral budesonide suspension (OBS) consists of budesonide formulated in a viscous suspension 
that is designed to increase the residence time of budesonide on the surface of the esophagus 
after swallowing compared to a nonviscous suspension . Shire is developi[INVESTIGATOR_64618] a 
first-line therap y for EoE in adolescents and adults.
The nonclinical pharmacology , pharmacokinetics, and toxicity  and the clinica l pharmacology , 
pharmacokinetics, and safety  of budesonide are well studied because budesonide is present in 
several US FDA -approved drug products. Budesonide is currently marketed for the 
management of Crohn’s disease, for asthma maintenance, for the trea tment of allergic rhinitis, 
and for induction of remission in patients with active, mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. 
Budesonide has strong glucocorticoid receptor affinity  and is subject to considerable first pass 
metabolism by [CONTACT_64683] a short 
half-life. These attributes permit budesonide to act 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_64619] y in the gut mucosa for treatment of inflammatory  disorders such as Crohn’s 
disease and ulcerative colitis. Once absorbed into the systemic circulation, budesonide is 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_64620] ( FDA ,
2011).
The efficacy  of OBS for the treatment of EoE has been demonstrated in 2Phase 2 studies in 
the OBS clinical development program. Studies MPI 101-01 and MPI 101-
06 evaluated the 
efficacy  of OBS in the treatment of EoE in children and adolescents aged 2-18 years and in 
adolescents and adults aged 11-40 years, respectively , by [CONTACT_64684] 
(defined as mean peak eosinophil count ≤6eos/HPF after treatment). Study  MPI 101-06 also 
evaluated symptom response as measured by [CONTACT_64685] (DSQ). 
For non-commercial use only
Shire CONFIDENT IAL 05 Dec 2015
Protocol SHP621 -302 Version 1.0 Page 29of 96
The DSQ contains 4 questions related to consumption of solid food, the presence of d ysphagia 
and its severity , aswell as pain. The DSQ score is calculated only from responses to the
questions related to dysphagia ,and this clinical outcome assessment was considered to be fit 
for purpose as a result of the MPI 101-06 study . Results from Study  MPI 101-01 
demonstrated a statistically significant histologic response (eosinophil count ≤6eos/HPF) and 
remission (eosinophil count ≤1eos/HPF) in the medium -dose (1.4-2.0mg daily) and high-
dose (2.8-4.0mg daily) OBS groups compared to placebo following [ADDRESS_70064] for OBS vs placebo was shown for both 
the coprimary  efficacy endpoints of histologic response and change from baseline in 
dysphagia symptoms. Following 12weeks of twice daily treatment (once every morning after 
meal s[qAM, pc] and at bedtime [hs]), OBS -
treated subjects demonstrated a highl y consistent 
reduction from baseline values for cellular (mean peak eosinophil count and histopathology  
features), organ (endoscopy  score) ,and holistic measures (Phy sician Global Assessment and 
DSQ scores); these results were independent of the ty pe of rater/reviewer (central pathologist, 
physician at the study  site, or subject). 
This Phase 3 extension study  follows the SHP621 -301 induction study , a Phase 3 randomized, 
double -blind, multicenter, study to evaluate the efficacy , safety , and tolerability  of twice daily 
administration of OBS (qAM, pc, and hs) in adolescents and adults aged 11-55 years, 
inclusive, with EoE and dysphagia . Study  SHP621 -301 is designed to provide safety  and 
efficacy  data demonstrating histologic response (as measured by [CONTACT_64686] 
≤6eos/HPF) and improvement in dysphagia symptoms (as measured by [CONTACT_64676]) following 
[ADDRESS_70065] version of the SHP621 investigator’s brochure for the overall 
risk/benefit assessment and the most accurate and current information regarding the drug 
metabolism, pharmacokinetics, efficacy ,and safety of SHP621.

2. STUDY OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE
2.1 Rationale for the Study
Currently  there is no approved medication for the treatment of EoE. This Phase 3 study  is 
being condu cted to determine response to withdrawal of OBS, maintenance of response, 
extended therapy  response, and response to intermittent therapy  by e valuating both eosinophil 
counts and DSQ in adolescent and adults treated or withdrawn from OBS in this treatment 
extension study .
2.2 Study Objectives
2.2.1 Primary Objective
The primary objective of the study  is:
To evaluate the maintenance of efficacy  over 36 weeks, as measured by [CONTACT_64687] (DSQ) score, through a 
randomized withdrawal design for subjects who responded to 12 weeks of OBS treatment 
(2mg twice daily) with a peak count of ≤6 eosinophils (eos)/high -powered field (HPF) 
across all available esophageal levels atthe final treatment visit and a ≥30% reduction in 
DSQ score from baseline during the SHP621 -301 i nduction study
2.2.2 Secondary Objectives
The key secondary  objective of this study  is:
To evaluate the long-term treatment response over an extended period of 36 weeks for 
subjects who were randomized to OBS tre atment but did not respond after 12 weeks in the 
SHP621 -301 induction study  (subject did not have a peak count of ≤
6 eos/HPF across all 
available esophageal levels at the final treatment visit and/or a ≥30% reduct ion in DSQ 
score from baseline)
Additional secondary  objectives of the study  are:
To evaluate the response to OBS treatment over 36 weeks for subjects who received
placebo in the SHP621 -301 induction study
To evaluate the effect of reinitiating OBS treatment for subjects who relapse after being 
randomized to placebo in the randomized withdrawal period (treatment -
withdrawal -treatment reinitiation)
To assess endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_64621] (EREFS)
To evaluate other responding criteria based on histology  and DSQ
To evaluate the long -term safet y and tolerability of OBS treatment

3. STUDY DESIGN
3.1 Study Design and Flow Chart
This is a Phas e 3, multicenter, double -blind study  to evaluate the efficacy , safet y and 
tolerability of OBS treatment administered twice daily (qAM, pc, and hs) for 36weeks. The 
study  will be conducted in adolescents and adults, aged 11-55 years, inclusive, with EoE and 
dysphagia who completed the SHP621-301 i nduction study .
Approximately  200 subjects (88%) who were randomized in the SHP621 -301 study  are 
estimated to complete the SHP621 -301 study  and will be enrolled in this treatment extension 
study  based on enrollment observed in the Phase 2 study  (MPI 101-06). Randomization into 
the randomized withdraw al period will be stratified by [CONTACT_64688]621 -301 study .Subjects who are full responders (defined as ≤6 eos/HPF
across all available esophageal levels and at least a 30% reduction in DSQ at the final 
treatment evaluation visit [Visit 4]) in the SHP621 -
301 induction study  will be eligible to 
enter the randomized withdrawal period to receive either OBS 2 mg twice daily  or placebo at 
a 1:1 ratio. The randomization of subjects who are full responders will also be stratified by 
[CONTACT_654] (adults and adolescents) to ensure approximately  equal number of subjects within each 
age group are assigned to the treatment groups.
This study  will consist of 3 periods:  4-week screening period, 36-week double -blind 
treatment period, and 4-week safet y follow
-up ( Figure 3
-1).

Subjects will be required to visit the site up to 8 times over up to a 36-week period. Following 
comple tion of the screening visit, subjects will be evaluated for eligibility  and safet y at 
Week 0(Visit 1). Subjects who are eligible and randomized will have efficacy  and safet y 
assessments at Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 28, and 36(Visits 2-8) and additional safety 
assessments at follow -up at Week 40(Visit 9). Subjects who fail to meet all e ligibility  criteria 
at Visits 0or 1will be considered screen failures
. These subjects will receive a follow -up 
safet y phone call 4weeks after the last dose of investigational product . Subjects cannot be 
rescreened once they have been designated as a screen failure. Subjects who discontinue will 
not be replaced.
The screening period will start when subjects sign informed consent (or assent as applicable 
for subjects <18yearsof age; screening visit [Visit 0]) and will be ≤4weeks in duration. 
During the screening period , assessments from the SHP621 -301 f inal treatment evaluation

response information (reduction in DSQ from baseline and eosinophilic count as determined 
by a central reader) collected during the SHP621 -301 f inal treatment evaluation visit to be 
entered into the interactive web-based response system (IWRS) by [CONTACT_64689] -to-day conduct 
of the study . Once response information is available, subjects will return for the 
randomization visit (Visit 1 ) to receive investigational product. S ubjects who continue to meet 
eligibility  criteria after the screening visit (Visit 0) will enter the 36-w eek double -blind 
treatment period.
Subjects who were assigned to OBS treatment and who fully responded in the SHP621-301 
study  (≤6 eos/ HPF across all a vailable esophageal levels and at least a 30% reduction in DSQ 
at the final treatment evaluation visit) will enter a randomized withdrawal period to receive 
either OBS 2 mg twice daily or placebo at a 1:1 ratio. These subjects will also be stratified by 
[CONTACT_654] (adults and adolescents). Subjects who were assigned to OBS treatment and did not 
respond or partiall y responded in the SHP621 -[ADDRESS_70066] DSQ data from the
SHP621 -301 (post randomization) and this extension study  until the database l ocks occurs for
this extension study .  
At Week 12, all subjects will undergo an upper esophagogastroduodenoscopy  (EGD) with 
biopsy  to evaluate eosinophil counts. Upon receipt of blinded EGD and DSQ data, subjects on 
placebo in the randomized withdrawal period who have relapsed will have their treatment 
assignment changed to OBS 2 mg twice dailyat the next scheduled visit. The criteria for 
relapse is having an eosinophilic count of ≥15 eos/HPF from at least 2of [ADDRESS_70067] will 
remain assigned to placebo. The upper EGD with esophageal biopsies will be repeated at the

prevalence of EoE in older patients (Dellon et al., 2014a ) and the fact that asEoE persists, it 
becomes 
more fibrostenotic in older patients and would not be amenable to anti -inflammatory 
treatment alone (Dellon et al., 2014b). A natura l history  study demonstrated that for every

Fibrostenotic disease is treated with dilatation and is not amenable to anti-inflammatory 
treatment alone. Therefore, budesonide is not expected to be an effective treatment for the 
majority  of patients above age 55.
The design of this study  combines randomized withdrawal and long-term extension elements 
in a manner that selects appropriate patients for placebo withdrawal and maintains 
double -blinding of subjects in all treatment groups. Only  subjects who are full responders to 
OBS 2 mg twice daily in the SHP621 -301 induction study (≤6 eos/HPF across all available 
esophageal levels and at least a 30% reduction in DSQ at the final treatment evaluation visit 
of SHP621 -301), will be eligible for randomized withdrawal . The randomized withdr awal 
period is required to assess maintenance of efficacy  in these subjects. The continuation of

during the randomized withdrawal and who reinitiate treatment with OBS 2 mg twice daily 
(intermittent therap y), separate descriptive analy ses for histological data and DSQ endpoints 
will be con ducted at each assessment visit, as descri bed in Section 9.8.2. For all subjects, an
esophageal stricture requiring dilation would be considered a treatment failure and result in 
withdrawal of the subject from the study . Subject withdrawal criteria are provide din 
Section 4.5.1.

6.2.2 Allocation of Subjects to Treatment 
This study  consists of a 4-week screening period and a double -blind treatment period. The 
actual treatment given to individual subjects during the double -blind treatment period will be 
d
etermined by [CONTACT_64694]621 -301 final 
treatment evaluation vi sit.
Subjects will be randomized via a computer -generated randomization schedule at the 
randomization visit (Visit 1) following a 4-week screening period and confirmation of study 
eligibility . Subjects who fully  responded to OBS treatment in the SHP621 -
301 study 
(≤6eos/HPF across all available esophageal levels and at least a 30% reduction in DSQ at the 
final treatment evaluation visit) will enter a randomized withdrawal period to receive either 
OBS 2mg twice daily or placebo at a 1:[ADDRESS_70101] DSQ data from the 
SHP621 -301 study  (post randomization) and until database lock occurs for this extension 
study .  
Randomization of subjects in the random ized withdrawal period will also be stratified by [CONTACT_654] 
(adults and adolescents) to ensure approximately equal number of subjects within each age 
group are assigned to the treatment groups.
Subject numbers are assigned to all subjects as they consent to take part in the study . The 
subject number consists of the [ADDRESS_70102] will 
occur twice daily (qAM, pc, and hs), with no ingestion of food or liquids permitted for 
30minutes after study  drug administration. Subjects randomized to OBS will receive 10mL 
of 0.2 mg/mL of OBS (2 mg) twice dail yfor a total daily dose of 4mg.
At Week 12, all subjects 
will undergo an upper esophagogastroduodenoscopy  (EGD) with 
biopsy  to evaluate eosinophil counts. Upon receipt of blinded EGD and DSQ data, subjects on 
placebo in the randomized withdrawal period who have relapsed will have their treatment 
assignment changed to OBS 2 mg twice daily. The criteria for relapse is having an eosinophil 
count of ≥15 eos/HPF from at least [ADDRESS_70103] be completed over 14 
consecutive days in order to determine the criterion for relapse . If fewer than 8 diary  entries 
are reported within the2-week period, theDSQ window can be expanded as described in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS]
. The criteria for relapse align with the related inclusion criteria for 
participation in the SHP621- [ADDRESS_70104]’s treatment assignment to OBS 2 mg twice daily if 
relapse is confirmed.
If the W eek 12 or an unscheduled EGD reveals an eosinophil count of ≥15from at least [ADDRESS_70105]’s treatment assignment will be changed to OBS [ADDRESS_70106] (OBS or placebo) administered at the 
randomization visit (Visit 1) and all morning doses of investigational product administered at

7. STUDY PROCEDURES
7.1 Study Schedule
The detailed study  procedures/assessments to be performed throu ghout the study  are outlined 
in the Schedule of Assessments (Table 1-1) and must be referred to in conjunction with the 
instructions provided in this section. 
Prior to performing any study -related procedures (including those related to screening), the 
investigator or his/her designee must obtain written informed consent from the subjec t (as per 
local requirements). There must be documentation of consent (as per local requirements) 
indicating that the subject is aware of the investigational nature of the study and the required 
procedures and restrictions, prior to performing any  study -related procedures.
7.1.1 Screening Period (Week s -4to 0)
The screening period starts when subjects sign informed consent. The screening period will 
comprise up to 4weeks, during which all procedures listed for the screening visit (Visit 0) in 
Table 1-1shall be completed. The screening period will allow for the determination of 
eligibility  of each subject’s inclusion into the study .A subject should not be instructed to 
discontinue use of any medication or treatment to participate in this study  until infor med 
consent has been obtained. Subjects should not stop permitted 
medications or treatments that 
are effective and well tolerated to participate in this study (Section 5.2.1).
Asse ssments from the SHP621 -301 final treatment evaluation visit (Visit 4) will be used as 
the screening assessments (Visit 0) of this treatment extension study . Screening assessments 
may take place 
across several days to allow an appropriate time frame in which to complete 
all procedures and confirm study  eligibility . At the SHP621 -[ADDRESS_70117] (based 
on treatment 
assignment in SHP621 -301) that will last for up to 4 weeks prior to enrolling into this 
treatment extension study. The 4-week s creening period is required to allow for blinded 
treatment response information (reduction in DSQ from baseline and eosinophilic count as 
determined by a central reader) collected during the SHP621 -301 final treatment evaluation 
visit to be entered into the I WRS by 
[CONTACT_64700], un
blinded data team.
After the screening period, subjects who meet eligibility  criteria at the end of the screening 
visit (Visit 0) will enter the 36-week double -blind treatment period . This period should not 
commence until all screening assessments required to confirm initial eligibility  have been 
completed. If the subject does not meet eligibility criteria following completion of screening 
assessments, the investigat or 
or designee will document the subject as a screen failure in the 
IWRS.
A screen failure is a subject who has given informed consent and failed to meet the inclusion 
criteria and/or met at least [ADDRESS_70118] been designated as a screen 
failure.
[IP_ADDRESS] Screening Visit ( Visit 0) / Visit 4 of SHP621 -301 Study
The screening visit (Visit 0) assessments and procedures , beginning with informed consent, 
will be performed as outlined in Table 1-1.
The following procedures will be performed at the screening visit:
Obtain subject c onsent (or assent as applicable for subjec ts <18 years).
Review eligibility  criteria.
Review medical history .
Perform AE assessments, including specific assessments for signs of glucocorticoid 
excess. Any  AE that occurs during this visit will be recorded in the CRF and considered a 
TEAE.
Review current use of concomitant medications and procedures . Note: Subjects who are 
on a PPI  [INVESTIGATOR_64630] , and if they  are not 
taking a PPI, they  must remain off of a PPI  [INVESTIGATOR_64623] .
Dispense the DSQ electronic patient -reported outcome (ePRO) device for nightl y 
completion and train the subject on its use. 
The following procedures will be performed at the final treatment evaluation visit (Visit 4)of 
SHP621 -301 and will be used as the screening ass essments for this extension study :
Review investigational product dosing compliance.
Record vital signs (including blood pressure [systolic and diastolic], heart rate, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1520], and temperature), height, and weight. Perform stadiometry  in subjects aged
11-
17years, inclusive. Vital signs will be assessed after the subject has been in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_12473] 5 minutes immediately  prior to the assessment.
Clinical chemistry , hematology , and urinal ysis laboratory  tests will be performed on all 
subje cts; all subjects must fast overnight prior to collection.
Morning cortisol (performed between 6:00 and 9:00 AM). Subjects should be instructed 
not to take the morning dose of investigational product until after the morning cortisol test 
has been performe d. 
Administer adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation testing; the type of 
synthetic and route of administration will be per local lab discretion. Additional cortisol 
samples will be drawn at 30 and 60 minutes following stimulation testing.

[IP_ADDRESS] Physical Examination (Including Height and Weight)
Abnormalities identified at the screening visit (Visit 0) will be documented in the subject’s 
source documents and on the medical history  CRF.Changes after the screening visit (Visit 0)
will be captured as AEs on the AE CRF page, as deemed b y the investigator.
Physical examination assessments at each visit should also include specific assessments for 
signs of glucocorticoid excess (eg, moon faces, acne, hirsutism, mood swings, insomnia, and 
depression). Physical examination at the screening visit (Visit 0) will also include Tanner 
Staging Assessments for subjects < 18 years of age.
Height will be collected at the screening visit (Visit 0) and Visit 8for all subjects.

[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event Collection
At each study  visit, subjects will be questioned in a general way to ascertain if AEs have 
occurred 
since the previous visit (eg,“Have you had any health problems since your last 
visit?”). AEs are collected from the time informed consent is signed. (Please refer to 
Section 8.)Any AE that is ongoing from the SHP621 -[ADDRESS_70141] be recor ded on the CRF

treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorabl e and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory  finding), symptom, or disease temporally  associated with the use of a 
medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) 
product (ICH Guidance E2A 1995).  
All AEs are collected from the time the informed consent is signed until the defined follow- up 
period stated in Section 7.1.3. This includes events occurring during the screening period of 
the study , regardless of whether or not investigat ional product is administered. Where 
possible, a diagnosis rather than a list of symptoms should be recorded. If a diagnosis has not 
been made, then each symptom should be listed individually .All AEs should be captured on 
the appropriate AE pages in the CRF and in source documents. In addition to untoward AEs, 
unexpected benefits outside the investigational product indication should also be captured on 
the AE CRF.
All AEs must be followed to closure (the subject’s health has returned to his/her baseline 
status or all varia bles have returned to normal), regardless of whether the subject is still 
participating in the study. Closure indicates that an outcome is reached, stabilization achieved 
(the investigator does not expect any further improvement or worsening of the event), or the 
event is otherwise explained. When appropriate, medical tests and examinations are 
performed so that resolution of event(s) can be documented.
8.1.[ADDRESS_70145] be recorded as new AEs (for example, if a subject experiences mild intermittent 
dyspepsia prior to dosing of investigational product, but the dyspepsia becomes severe and 
more frequent after first dose of investigational product has been administered, a new AE of 
severe d yspepsia [with the appropriate date of onset] is recorded on the appropriate CRF).

The medical assessment of severit y is determined by [INVESTIGATOR_1477]:
Mild: A type of AE that is usually  transient and may require only minimal treatment 
or therapeutic intervention. The event does not generall y interfere with usual 
activities of daily  living.
Moderate: A type of AE that is usually  alleviated with specific therapeutic intervention.  
The event interferes with usual activities of dail y living, causing discomfort but 
poses no signif icant or permanent risk of harm to the research subject.
Severe: A type of AE that interrupts usual activities of daily  living, or significantly  
affects clinical status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention.
8.1.2 Relationship Categorization
A physician/investigator must make the assessment of relationship to invest igational product 
for each AE. The investigator should decide whether, in his or her medical judgment, there is 
a reasonable possibility  that the event may  have been caused by  [CONTACT_64715]. If 
there is no valid reason for suggesting a relationship, then the AE should be classified as “not 
related .” Otherwise, if there is any valid reason, even if undetermined or untested, for 
suspecting a possible cause -and-effect relationshi p between the investigational product and 
the occurrence of the AE, then the AE should be considered “related ”based on the definitions 
in Table 8-1. The causality  assessment must be documented in the source document.
Table 8-1: Adverse Event Relatedness
Term Relationship Definition
Not Related Unrelated to study drug.
Possibly RelatedA clinical event or laboratory abnormality with a reasonable time sequence to 
administration of study drug, but which could also be explained by [CONTACT_64716].
Probably RelatedA clinical event or laboratory abnormality with a reasonable time sequence to 
administration of study drug, unlikely to be attributable to concurrent disease or 
other drugs and chemicals and which follows a clinically reason able response on 
dechallenge. The association of the clinical event or laboratory abnorm ality must 
also have some biologic plausibility, at least on theoretical grounds.
Definitely RelatedThe event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the study 
drug, follows a known or suspected response pattern to the study drug, is confirmed 
by [CONTACT_48017][INVESTIGATOR_35648] (dechallenge), and reappears upon 
repeated exposure (rech allenge). Note that this is not to be construed as requiring 
reexposure of the patient to study drug; however, the determination of definitely

8.1.4 Symptoms of the Disease u nder Study
Symptoms of the disease under study  should not be classed as AEs as long as they are within 
the normal day-to-day fluctuation or expected progression of the disease and are part of the 
efficacy  data to be collected in the study ; however, significant worsening of the symptoms 
should be recorded as an AE.
8.1.[ADDRESS_70147] to the start of study 
treatment, further investigations should be performed until the values return to within the 
reference range or until a plausible explanation (eg,concomitant disease) is found for the 
abnormal values.
The investigator should decide, based on the above criteria and the clinical condition of a 
subject, whether a change in a clinical laboratory or vital sign parameter is clinicall y 
significant and therefore represents an AE.

reports) must also be sent to the CRO/Shire medical monitor using the details specified in the 
emergency  contact [CONTACT_1739]. The pregnant female study  participant 
must be withdrawn f rom the study .
Every  effort should be made to gather information regarding the pregnancy  outcome and 
condition of the infant. It is the responsibility  of the investigator to obtain this information 
within 30 calendar days after the initial notification and approximately  30 calendar days 
postpartum.
Pregnancy  complications such as spontaneous abortion/miscarriage or congenital abnormalit y 
are considered SAEs and must be reported using the Shire Clinical Study  Adverse Event 
Form for SAEs and Non-serious AEs as Required by [CONTACT_1738] . Note: An elective abortion is 
not considered an SAE.
In addition to the above, if the investigator determines that the pregnancy  meets serious 
criteria, it must be reported as an SAE using the Shire Clinical Study  Adverse Event For m for 
SAEs and Non-serious AEs as Required by [CONTACT_64717]. The test date of the first positive serum/urine

described in Section 8.2. Note: The 24 -hour reporting requirement for SAEs does not apply  to 
reports of abuse, misuse, overdose, or medication errors unless these result in an SAE. 
The categories below are not mutually  exclusive; the event can meet more than 1 category .
 Abuse –Persistent or sporadic intentional intake of investigational product when used 
for a nonmedical purpose (eg,to alter one’s state of consciousness or get high) in a 
manner that may  be detrimental to the individual and/or society
 Misuse –Intentional use of inv estigational product other than as directed or indicated at 
any dose (Note: this includes a situation where the investigational product is not used as 
directed at the dose prescribed by  [CONTACT_760])

8.2.3 Serious Adverse Event Definition
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence (whether consi dered to 
be related to investigational product or not) that at any  dose:
 Results in death
 Is life-threatening. Note: The term “life-threatening ”in the definition of “serious” refers 
to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not 
refer to an event which hy pothetically  might have caused death if it was more severe.
 Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3850]. Note: 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], which are the result of elective or previousl y scheduled surgery  for 
pre-existing conditions, which have not worsened after initiation of treatment, should 
not be classified as SAEs. For example, an admission for a previously scheduled ventral 
hernia repair would not be classified as an SAE; however, complication(s) resulting 
from a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_64635](s) 
serious criteria must be reported as SAE(s).
 Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity .
 Is a congenital abnormality /birth defect .
 Is animportant medical event. Note: Important medical events that may not result in 
death, be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12475], 
based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed in this 
definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring 
intensive treatment in an emergency  room or at home; blood dyscrasias or convulsions 
that d o not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or the development of drug dependency  or 
drug abuse.  
8.2.4 Serious Adverse Event Collection Time Frame
All SAEs (regardless of relationship to study) are collected from the time the subject signs the 
informed consent until the defined follow -up period stated in Section 7.1.[ADDRESS_70151] awareness of the event. 
In addition, any SAE(s) consi dered “related” to the investigational product and discovered by 
[CONTACT_64719] [ADDRESS_70152]’s death (ie,the SAE was noted as the primary  cause of 
death) must have “fatal”checked as an outcome with the date of death recorded as the 
resolution date. For all other events ongoing at the time of death that did not contribute to the 
subject’s death, the outcome should be considered as not resolved, without a resolution date 
recorded.
For any SAE that results in the subject’s death or any ongoing events at the time of death, 
unless another investigational product action was previously  taken (eg, drug interrupted, 
reduced, withdrawn), the action taken with the inves tigational product should be recorded as 
“dose not changed” or “not applicable” (if the subject never received investigational product). 
The investigational product action of “withdrawn” should not be selected solely  as a result of 
the subject’s death. 
8.2.[ADDRESS_70153], Ethics Committee, and Site 
Reporting
The sponsor and the clinical CRO areresponsible for notify ing the relevant regulatory 
authorities/US central Institutional Review Boards ( IRBs)of related, unexpected SAEs.
In addition ,the sponsor and the clinical CRO areresponsible for notify ing active sites of all 
related, unexpected SAEs occurring during all interventional studies across theSHP621
program.  
The investigator is responsible for notify ing the local IRB, local ethics committee ( EC), or the 
relevant local regulatory  authority  of all SAEs that occur at his or her site as required.

9. DATA MANAGEMENT AND STATISTICAL METHODS
9.1 Data Collection
The investigators’ authorized site personnel must enter the information requir ed by [CONTACT_64720]. A study  monitor will visit each site in accordance with the monitoring 
plan and review the CRF data against the source data for completeness and accuracy .
Discrepancies between source data and data entered on the CRF wil l be address ed by 
[CONTACT_1746]. When a data discrepancy warrants correction, the correction will be 
made by [CONTACT_1747]. Data collection procedures will be discussed with the site 
at the site initiation visit and/or at the investi gator’s meeting. Once a subject is randomized, it 
is expected that site personnel will complete the CRF entry  within approximately  [ADDRESS_70154]’s visit.
9.2 Clinical Data Management
Data are to be entered into a clinical database as specified in the CRO’s data management 
plan. Quality  control and data validation procedures are applied to ensure the validity  and 
accuracy  of the clinical database.
Data are to be reviewed and checked for omissions, errors, and values requiring further 
clarificati on using compu terized and manual procedures. Data queries requiring clarification 
are to be communicated to the site for resolution. Only  authorized personnel will make 
corrections to the clinical database, and all corrections are documented in an auditabl e 
manner.
9.3 Data Handling Considerations
Data that may potentially  unblind the treatment assignment ( ie,investigational product serum 
concentrations, treatment allocation, and investigational product preparation/accountability  
data) will be handled with special care during the data cleaning and review process. These 
data will be handled in such a way that, prior to unblinding, any data that may unblind study 
team personnel will be presented as blinded information or otherw ise will not be made 
available. If applicable, unblinded data may be made available to quality  assurance 
representatives for the purposes of conducting independent drug audits. 
9.4 Statistical Analysis Process
The study  will be analy zed by [CONTACT_10196]. All statistical analyses will be 
performed using SAS®(SAS I nstitute, Cary , NC, [LOCATION_003]) version 9.3 or higher.
The statistical analysis plan (SAP)will provide the statistical methods and definitions for the 
analysis of the efficacy  and safet y data, as well as describe the approaches tobe taken for 
summarizing other study information such as subject disposition, demographics and baseline 
characteristics, investigational product exposure, and prior and concomitant medications. The

Protocol SHP621 -302 Version 1.0 Page 77of 96
SAP will also include a description of how missing, unuse d and spurious data will be 
addressed.
The SAP will be finalized prior to final database lock and performing analy sis (ie, unblinding )
to preserve the integrit y of the statistical a nalysis and study  conclusions. 
9.5 Planned Interim Analysis, Adaptive Design, and Data Monitoring Committee
No interim anal ysis is planned.
9.6 Sample Size Calculation and Power Considerations
Approximately  200 subjects (88%) who are randomized in the SHP621 -301 study  are 
estimated to complete the SHP621 -301 study  and enroll in this treatment extension study 
based on enrollment observed in the Phase 2 stud y (MPI  101- 06).
The primary  efficacy  measure of the study  will be the proportion of subjects who relapse 
during the double -blind randomized withdrawal period , defined as having an eosinophil count 
of ≥15 eos/HPF from at least 2of 3levels of the esophagus (as determined by a central 
reader) and at least 4 days of dysphagia in the 2-week period prior to the scheduled visit (as 
determined by [CONTACT_64676] ). To be considered as a subject with relapse , both criteria must be 
met. To determine whether a subject meets the criterion for dysphagia, at least [ADDRESS_70155] be completed over 14 consecutive days, as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS].
Based on observation in the Phase 2 study  (MPI 101-06), approximately  26% of subjects, or 
approximately  [ADDRESS_70156] 
a 50 percentage point differe nce between relapse proportions of 20% and 70% in the OBS and 
placebo groups, respectively , at 80% power and a significance level of 0.05 (two -sided) using 
a Chi-Square test with equal allocation to treatment groups, it is necessary  to assess the 
primary  efficacy  measure for approximately  38subjects (19 subjects in each of the OBS and 
placebo groups).  
9.[ADDRESS_70157].
The intent -to-treat (ITT) setwill include all randomized subjects. Subjects will be analyzed 
according to their assigned treatment, regardless of the treatment actuall y received.
The full analysis set (FAS) will include all randomized subjects who received at least [ADDRESS_70158] baseline efficacy  assessment (biopsy  and/or DSQ 
score) .
For non-commercial use only
Shire CONFIDENT IAL 05 Dec 2015
Protocol SHP621 -302 Version 1.0 Page 78of 96
The per-protocol (PP) set will include all subjects in the FAS excluding subjects with major 
protocol deviat ions. The PP set will be identified prior to unblindin g the treatment 
assignments b y a team consisting of, at a minimum, a physician and a statistician from Shire. 
9.[ADDRESS_70159] is relapse during the double -blind randomized 
withdraw al period. Relapse , a binary  response (either with a relapse or not), is defined as 
having an eosinophil count of ≥15eos/HPF from at least 2of 3levels of the esophagus, as 
determined by a central reader, and having at least [ADDRESS_70160] be completed over 14 
consecutive days, as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS].
The primary  efficacy endpoint will be analyzed asthe proportion of subjects with relapse
during the double -blind randomized withdrawal period for the FAS, using a Chi-Square test 
comparing OBS [ADDRESS_70161] will be 
two-sided, and conducted at the significance level of 0.05. The proportion of subjects with 
relapse for each treatment group and the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) will be 
estimated. In addition, the difference in the proportion of subjects with relapse between the 2
treatment groups and its 95% CI  will be es timated.
Subjects who withdraw without providing efficacy  data at the ET visit will be classified as 
being relapse rsin the primary  efficacy  analysis. The null hypothesis states that there is no 
difference in relapse proportions between OBS [ADDRESS_70162] to the 
observed data at each double -blind visit.
The following sensitivity  and supportive analyses will be performed for the primary  endpoint 
to evaluate the robustness of the results from the primary  anal ysis methods.
Similar analyses used for the ITT population will be repeated using the FAS and the PP 
d
atasets. Sensitivity  analyses will be performed using the ITT population by [CONTACT_64721]-relapsers. In 
addition, thesubjects who were prematurel y withdrawn from the study  without the primary 
efficacy  endpoint will be imputed randomly  according to the distribution of relapser s with 
available data ; and the similar statistical test will be performed using the imputed data .

9.8.2 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints
[IP_ADDRESS] Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoint
The key secondary  efficacy  endpoint isthe long-term treatment response , a binary  response
over an extended period of 36 weeks in adolescent and adult subjects who were randomized to 
OBS treatment but did not respond after 12 weeks inthe SHP621 -301 inducti on study
(subject did not have peak count of ≤6 eos/HPF across all available esophageal levels at the 
final treatment visit and/or ≥30% reduction in DSQ score from baseline )and met the 
following criteria :
Histologic response, defined as a peak eosinophil count of ≤6eos/HPF across all available 
esophageal levels at the final treatment period evaluation (Visit 8)
Dysphagia symptom response, defined as ≥30% reduction in the DSQ combined score 
(questions 2+3) from baseline of the SHP621 -301 study  and from baseline of this 
extension study  to the final tr eatment period evaluation (Visit 8)
The key secondary  efficacy  endpoint will be analy zed as the proportion of subjects who 
responded based on the histological data and the DSQ data at the final treatment period 
evaluation (Visit 8). The proportion of subje cts with long-term treatment response and the 
corresponding 95% confidence interval ( CI)will be estimated and summarized. 
The following secondary efficacy  endpoints will be analyzed in all subjects :
Histologic response, defined as a peak eosinophil count of ≤6eos/HPF across all available 
esophageal levels at each assessment visit
Dysphagia symptom response, defined as ≥30% reduction in the DSQ combined score 
(questions 2+3) at each assessment visit from baseline of the SHP621 -301 study  and from 
baseline of this extension study  
Change in the DSQ score and change in the peak eosinophilic count at each assessment 
visit from baseline of the SHP621 -301 study  and from baseline of this extension study
Change in total endoscopy  score, as measured by [CONTACT_64677], at each

9.9 Safety Analyses
Safety  data will be presented for the safet y set by [CONTACT_1570].
The safet y data collected at the randomization visit (Visit 1),or at the screening visit (Visit 0) 
if not collected at Visit 1,willbe used as the baseline value for safety  anal yses.
TEAEs are defined as AEs that start or deteriorate on or after the first dose of investigational 
product and no later than [ADDRESS_70163]. However, 
for any subjects who die during the study  (ie, the date of death is between the date of first 
dose of investigational product and the date of study  discontinuation entered by [CONTACT_779], 
inclusive), all AEs (including those resulting in death) that occur during the study  will be 
considered as TEAEs irrespective of the last dose and will be included in the TEAE 
summaries.
AEs will be coded using MedDRA . The number of events, incidence, and percentage of 
TEAEs will be calculated overall by [CONTACT_9313] , preferre d term, and treatment group.
TEAEs will be further summarized by [CONTACT_64722]. 
AEs related to investigational product, AEs leading to withdrawal, SAEs, and deaths will be 
similarly  summarized/listed.
Safety  parameters will include monitoring of AEs, physical examinations, stadiometry , vital 
signs (temperature, systolic and diast olic blood pressure, pulse, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_2842]), weight 
and height assessments, DXA scans for BMD and body  composition measurements (for 
adolescents aged 11-17 years, inclusive), clinical laboratory  tests (hematology , chemistry , 
urinaly sis; serum pregnan cy test, if appropriat e), and ACTH stimulation tests. To account for 
the effects of pubert yin adolescent subjects (11-17 yearsof age, inclusive ), BMD z-scores 
will be adjusted for height z-scores using the Bone Mineral Densit y in Childhood Study  
calculat or (Bone Mineral Densit y in Childhood Study , 2015)
.Safet y parameters will be 
descriptivel y summarized by [CONTACT_64723].

Protocol SHP621 -302, Am endment 1 22Jun 2016
SUMMAR Y OF CHANGES F ROM PREVIOUS VERSION
The SHP621-302 protocol is amended to address the following items:
Clarification of relapse criterion based on day s of dy sphagia reported on the Dy sphagia 
Symptom Questionnaire prior to study visits with consi deration of the potential for missing 
diary  entries 
Additional safet y monitoring added for subjects with clinical evidence of adverse HPA 
effects
Clarification of withdrawal criteria to ensure that only  subjects with s evere signs and 
symptoms of EoE are w ithdrawn from the study
Methods for primary  efficacy  anal ysis updated from chi- square test to Fisher’s Exact test
Additional edits, as captured in the below table, were made to Protocol Amendment 1 to improve 
the clarit y of the protocol and/or correct min or inconsistencies. Note that correction of t ypos and 
grammatical errors are not captured in the below table.

The primary efficacy endpoint w ill be analyzed as the proportion of subjects 
with relapse during the end of the double -blind randomized withdrawal 
period for the FAS, using Fisher’s Exact a chi -square test comparing OBS [ADDRESS_70180] placebo.
Relapse proportions at each adjacent double -blind visit interval will also be 
assessed by [CONTACT_64738]’s Exact chi-square test to the observed data 
at each double -blind visit.
Rationale: The primary efficacy analysis method h as been changed from the 
Chi-square test to Fisher’s exact test. Considering the expected number of 
subjects in the randomized withdraw al portion of the study, and the very 
small number of subjects who are expected to relapse in the OBS group, the 
Fisher’s exact test is considered a more appropriate method .Synopsis : Statistical

STUDY SYNOPSIS
Protocol num ber: SHP621 -302 Drug: SHP621, oral budesonide s uspension (OBS )
Title of the study: A Phase 3, Multicenter, Double -blind Extension Study to Ev aluate Maintenance of Efficacy of 
Oral Budesonide Suspension (OBS ) and Long -term Treatm ent Effect of OBS in Adolescent and Adult Subjects (11 
to 55 Years of Age, Inclusive ) with Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE)
Number of subjects (total and for each treatm ent arm):
Approximately 200 subjects (88%) w ho are randomized in the SHP621 -301 study are estimated to complete the 
SHP621 -301 study and enroll in this treatment extension study based on enrollment observed in the Phase 2 study 
(MPI 101 -06).
Investigator(s) : Multicenter study
Site(s) and Region(s):
Approximately 60sites in North America
Study period (planned):
April 2016 –April 2019Clinical phase: 3
Objectives
Primary:
To evaluate the maintenance of efficacy over 36 w eeks, as measured by [CONTACT_64744] (DSQ) score, through a randomized withdraw al design for subjects who 
responded to 12 w eeks of OBS treatment (2 mg twice daily) w ith a peak count of ≤6 eosinophils 
(eos)/high -powered field (HPF) across all available esophageal levels at the final treatment visit and a ≥30% 
reduction in DSQ score from baseline during the SHP621 -301 induction study
Key Secondary:
To evaluat e the long -term treatm ent response over an extended period of 36 w eeks for subjects who were 
randomized to OBS treatment but did not respond after 12 weeks in the SHP621 -301 induction study (subject 
did not have a peak count of ≤6 eos/HPF across all availa ble esophageal levels at the final treatment visit and/or 
a ≥30% reduction in DSQ score from baseline )
Secondary:
To evaluate the response to OBS treatment over 36 w eeks for subjects w ho received placebo in the SHP621 -301 
induction study
To evaluate the ef fect of reinitiating OBS treatment for subjects who relapse after being randomized to placebo 
in the random ized withdraw al period (treatment- withdrawal -treatment reinitiation)
To assess endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_64642] E ndoscopic Reference Score 
(EREFS)
To evaluate other respon secriteria based on histology and DSQ
To evaluate the long -term safety and tolerability of OBS treatment

At Week 12, all subjects w ill undergo an upper esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with biopsy to evaluate 
eosinophil counts. Upon rece ipt of blinded EGD and DSQ data, subjects on placebo in the randomized withdrawal 
period who have relapsed will have their treatment assignment changed to OBS 2 mg twice daily . The criteria for 
relapse is having an eosinophilic count of ≥15 eos/ HPF from at least [ADDRESS_70200] 4 days of dysphagia in the 2 -week period prior to the scheduled visit , as 
determined by [CONTACT_64676]. Considering the potential for missing diary entries, the determinati on of relapse based on 
days of dysphagia reported on the DSQ will occur as follows:
If at least [ADDRESS_70201] w ould 
meet the criterion for dysphagia symptom relapse. 
If les s than [ADDRESS_70202] w ould not meet criterion for dysphagia symptom relapse. 
If less than [ADDRESS_70203] meets the criteria for dysphagia symptom relapse over 14 consecutive days; however, the 
2-week period w ill not be shifted further if at least 8 diary entries are recorded in the 14 -day period and w ill not 
be shifted by [CONTACT_726] 2 weeks in total (ie, no more than 2 -week period plus additional 2 -week additional 
expansion) . 
The criteria for relap se align with the related inclusion criteria for participation in the SHP621 -[ADDRESS_70204]’s treatment 
assignment will be changed in a blinded manner from placebo to OBS 2 mg twice d aily at the subsequent study visit . 
If the W eek 12 or an unscheduled EGD reveal san eosinophil count of ≥[ADDRESS_70205]’s treatment assignment will be changed to OBS 2 mg twice daily at the next 
scheduled visit.
Methodology:
This is a Phase 3, double -blind, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of twice daily
administration of OBS (qAM, pc , and hs) in adolescents and adults aged 11 -55 years, inclusive, with EoE and 
dysphagia who comp leted the SHP621 -301 induction study . 
This study will comprise 3 periods: 4-week screening period , 36-week double -blind treatment period , and a 4 -week 
safety follow -up(Study Design Flow Chart ). 
All subjects who have completed the SHP621 -301 induction stu dy will 
be eligible to enroll in this extension study. Approximately 200subjects (88%) who were randomized in the 
SHP621 -301 study are estimated to complete the SHP621 -301 study and w ill be enrolled in this treatment extension 
study based on enrollment ob served in the Phase 2 study (MPI 101 -06).Randomization into the randomized 
withdrawal period will be stratified by [CONTACT_64675]621 -301 study.
Subjects who are full responders (defined as ≤6 eos/ HPF across all avai lable esophageal levels and at least a 30% 
reduction in DSQ at the final treatment evaluation visit [Visit 4]) in the SHP621- 301 induction study will be eligible 
to enter the randomized withdraw al period to receive either OBS 2 mg twice daily or placebo at a 1:1 ratio. The 
randomization of subjects who are full responders will also be stratified by [CONTACT_654] (adults and adolescents) to ensure 
approximately equal number of subjects w ithin each age group areassigned to the treatment groups .
Subjects who sign infor med consent (or assent as applicable for subjects <18 years) will be screened (Visit 0); 
assessments from the SHP621 -301 final treatment e valuation visit (Visit 4) will be used as the Visit 0 screening 
assessments of the treatment extension study . Subjects who meet eligibility criteria at the screening visit (Visit 0) 
will enter the [ADDRESS_70206] based on treatment 
assignment in SHP621 -301 for up to 4 w eeks prior to enrollment in the trea tmen t extension study. This 4 -week 
screening period is required to allow  for blinded treatment response information (reduction in DSQ from baseline 
and eosinophilic count as determined by a central reader) collected during the SHP621 -[ADDRESS_70207] restricted access to blinded treatment 
response information .Once inform ation is available in IWRS , subjects will return for the randomization visit (Visit 
1) to receive investigational product .
During the 36 -week treatment extension study, subjects who were assigned to, and fully responded to OBS 
treatment in the SHP621 -301 s tudy ( ≤6eos/HPF across all available esophageal levels and at least a 30% reduction 
in DSQ at the final treatment evaluation visit) w ill enter a randomized withdraw al period to receive either OBS 2 mg 
twice daily or placebo at a 1:1 ratio. Subjects w ho were ass igned to OBS treatment in the SHP621 -301 study and d id 
not respond or partially responded , will receive OBS 2 mg twice daily . Subjects who were assigned to placebo in the 
SHP621 -301 study will receive OBS 2 mg twice daily . At Week 12, all subjects w ill und ergo an upper 
esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) w ith biopsy to evaluate eosinophil counts. Upon receipt of blinded EGD and 
DSQ data, subjects on placebo in the randomized withdraw al period who have relapsed (>15 eos/ HPF from at least 
2 levels of the esophag us and specimens and 4 days of dysphagia over 2 weeks) will have their treatment assignment 
changed to OBS [ADDRESS_70208]’s treatment assignment w ill be changed in a blinded manner from placebo t o OBS [ADDRESS_70209].

Statistical Methodology for Prim ary Efficacy Endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint will be analyzed as the proportion of subjects withrelapse during the end of the 
double- blind randomized withdraw al period for the FAS, using Fisher’s Exact test comparing OBS [ADDRESS_70225] will be 2-sided, and conducted at the significance level of 0.05.
Theproportion of subjects w ith relapse for each treatment group and the corresponding 95% confidence interval 
(CI) w ill be estimated. In addition, the difference in the proportion of subjects with relapse betw een the 2treatment 
groups and its 95% CI will be estimated.
Subjects who withdraw  without providing efficacy data at the e arly termination (ET) v isit w ill be classified as being 
a relapser in the primary efficacy analysis. The null hypothesis states that there is no difference in relapse
proportions bet ween OBS 2 mg twice daily and placebo, with the 2-sided alternative of a nonzero difference 
betw een groups. Relapse proportions at each adjacent double- blind visit interval will also be assessed by [CONTACT_64746]’s Exact test to the observed data at each double- blind visit.
Statistical Methodology for Key Secon dary and Other Secondary Efficacy Endpoint s
To evaluate the long -term treatm ent response over an extended period of 36 w eeks forsubjects who were 
randomized to OBS treatment but did not respond after 12 weeks in the SHP621 -301 induction study (subject did 
not have peak count of ≤6 eos/HPF across all available esophageal levels at the final treatment visit and/or ≥30% 
reduction in DSQ score from baseline of SHP621 -301), the proportion of subjects who responded based on the 
histological data and the DSQ data at the final treatment period evaluation (Visit 8) and the corresponding 95% 
confidence interval ( CI)will be estimated and summarized .

Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page [ADDRESS_70226] (Visit 1) and no later than [ADDRESS_70227]. How ever, for any subjects who die during the study ( ie, the date of death is 
betw een the date of first dose of investigational product and the date of study discontinuation entered by [CONTACT_779], 
inclusive), all AEs (including those resulti ng in death) that occur during the study will be considered as TEAEs 
irrespective of the last dose and w ill be included in the TEAE summaries. 
Sample Size Justification
Approximately 200 subjects (88%) w ho are randomized in the SHP621 -301 study are estimated to complete the 
SHP621 -301 study and enroll in this treatment extension study based on enrollment observed in the Phase 2 study 
(MPI 101 -06).
The primary efficacy measure of the study will be the proportion of subjects who relapse during the double- blind 
randomized withdrawal p eriod . Relapse , a binary response (either with relapse or not), is defined as having an 
eosinophil count of ≥15eos/HPF from at least 2 of 3 levels of the esophagus (determined by a central reader) and 
having at least 4 days of dy sphagia in a 2 -week period prior to the scheduled visit (determined by [CONTACT_64676]) . To be 
considered as a subject w ith relapse , both criteria must be met.
Based on observation in the Phase 2 study (MPI 101 -06), approximately 26% of subjects, or approximately [ADDRESS_70228] a 50 percentage point difference between relapse proportions of 20% and 70% in the O BS 
and placebo groups, respectively, at more than 80% pow er and a significance level of 0.05 ( 2-sided) using the 
Fisher’s Exact test with equal allocation to treatment groups, it is necessary to assess the primary efficacy measure 
for approximately 38 subj ects (19 subjects in each of the OBS and placebo groups).

1. BACKGROUND INFORMATI ON
1.1 Indication and Current Treatment Options 
Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is defined as “a chronic, immune/antigen -mediated esophageal 
disease characterized clinically  by [CONTACT_64749]- predominant inflammation” ( Liacouras et al .2011 ).Clinical 
symptoms of EoE often vary  by [CONTACT_654]: Infants and toddlers present with feeding difficulties; 
school -aged children are more likely  to present with vomiting or pain; and adolescents and adults 
present with d ysphagia and fo od impaction. Wh en these sy mptoms are present, the diagnosis is 
confirmed b y finding eosinophilic inflammation of ≥15 eosinophils/high- power edfield (HPF) on 
at least 1 esophageal biopsy  and when other causes such as proton pump inhibitor (PPI )-
responsive esophageal eosin ophilia are excluded ( Dellon et al. 2014a ; Furuta et al . 2007). The 
standards of care are diet therapi[INVESTIGATOR_64617]- label use of glucocorticosteroids .Esophageal dilati on 
is used to temporarily  relieve sy mptoms but does not ad dress underl ying inflammation. Given 
the clinical outcomes associated with EoE, including severe d ysphagia, esophageal stricture, 
food impaction, and esophageal perforation ( Hirano and Aceves 2014; Liacouras et al. 2011) and 
the fact that there are currently  no FDA -approved treatments, there is a clear unmet medical need 
for an approved treatment that induces and maintains remission for patients with EoE 
(Furu taand Katzka 2015 ). 
1.[ADDRESS_70233] Background and Clinical Information
Oral budesonide suspension (OBS) consists of budesonide formulated in a viscous suspension 
that is designed to increase the residence time of budesonide on the surface of the esophagus 
after swallowing compared to a nonviscous suspension. S hire is developi[INVESTIGATOR_64618] a first -line 
therap y for EoE in adolescents and adults.
The nonclinical pharmacology , pharmacokinetics, and toxicity  and the clinical pharmacology , 
pharmacokinetics, and safety  of budesonide are well studied because budesonide is present in 
several US FDA -approved drug products. Budesonide is currentl y marketed for the management 
of Crohn’s 
disease, for asthma maintenance, for the treatment of allergic rhinitis, and for 
induction of remission in patients with active, mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. Budesonide 
has strong glucocorticoid receptor affinity and is subject to considerable firs t pass metabolism by  
[CONTACT_64683] a short half -life. These attributes permit budesonide to act rapi[INVESTIGATOR_64644]’s disease and ulcerative 
colitis. Once absorbed into the sy stemic c irculation, budesonide is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_64645] ( FDA 2011).
The efficacy  of OBS for the treatment of EoE has been demonstrated in 
2 Phase 2 studies in the 
OBS clinical development program. Studies MPI 101-01 and MPI 101-06 evalua ted the efficacy  
of OBS in the treatment of EoE in children and adolescents aged 2 -18 years and in adolescents 
and adults aged 11- 40 years, respectivel y, by [CONTACT_64684] (defined as mean 
peak eosinophil count ≤6 eos/HPF after treatment). Study  MPI 101- 06 also evaluated s ymptom 
response as measured b y the Dy sphagia S ymptom Questionnaire (DSQ). The DSQ contains 4 
questions related to consumption of solid food, the presence of d ysphagia and its severity , as
well as pain. The DSQ score 
is calculated onl y from responses to the questions related to

dysphagia , and this clinical outcome assessment was considered to be fit for purpose as a result 
of the MPI 101-06 study . Results from Study  MPI 101-01 demonstrated a statistically significant 
histologic response (eosinophil count ≤6eos/HPF) and remission (eosinophil count ≤1 eos/HPF) 
in the medium- dose (1.4 -2.0mg dail y) and high -dose (2.8-4.0mg daily) OBS groups compared 
to placebo following [ADDRESS_70234] for OBS vs placebo was shown for both the 
coprimary  efficacy  endpoints ofhistologic response and change from baseline in dy sphagia 
symptoms. Following 12 weeks of twice daily treatment (once every morning after meal s[qAM, 
pc] and at bedtime [hs]), OBS -treated subjects demonstrated a highly  consistent reduction from 
baseline values for cellular (mean peak eosinophil count and histopathology features), organ 
(endoscop y score)
,and holistic measures (Phy sician Global As sessment and DSQ scores); these 
results were independent of the ty pe of rater/reviewer (central pathologist, phy sician at the study  
site, or subject). 
This Phase 3 extension study  follows the SHP621 -301 induction study , a Phase 3 randomized, 
double -blind, multicenter, study to evaluate the efficacy , safet y, and tolerability  of twice dail y 
administration of OBS (qAM, pc, and hs) in adolescents and adults aged 11 -55 years, inclusive, 
with EoE and dy sphagia . Study  SHP621-301 is designed to provide safet y and efficacy  data 
demonstrating histologic response (as measured by  [CONTACT_64686] ≤6eos/HPF) and 
improvement in dy sphagia sy mptoms (as measured by  [CONTACT_64676]) following [ADDRESS_70235] version of the SHP621 investigator’s brochure for the overall 
risk/benefit assessment and the most accurate and current information regarding the drug 
metabolism, pharmacokinetics, efficacy ,and safety of SHP621.

2. STUDY OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE
2.1 Rationale for the Study
Currently  there is no approved medication for the treatment of EoE. This Phase 3 study  is being 
condu cted to determine response to withdrawal of OBS, maintenance of response, extended 
therap y response, and response to intermittent therapy  by [CONTACT_64750] .
2.2 Study Objectives
2.2.1 Primary Objective
The primary objective of the study  is:
To evaluate the maintenance of efficacy  over 36 weeks, as measured by  [CONTACT_64751] (DSQ) score, through a randomized 
withdrawal design for subjects who responded to 12 weeks of OBS treatment (2 mg twice 
daily ) with a peak count of ≤6 eosinophils (eos)/high- powered field (HPF) across all 
available esophageal levels at the final treatment visit and a ≥30% reduction 
in DSQ score 
from baseline during the SHP621 -301 i nduction study
2.2.2 Secondary Objectives
The key secondary  objective of this study  is:
To evaluate the long -term treatment response over an extended period of 36 weeks for 
subjects who were randomized to OBS tre atment but did not respond after 12 weeks in the 
SHP621 -301 i nduction study  (subject did not have a peak count of ≤6 eos/HPF across all 
available esophageal levels at the final treatment visit and/or a ≥30% reduct ion in DSQ score 
from baseline)
Additional secondary  
objectives of the study  are:
To evaluate the response to OBS treatment over 36 weeks for subjects who re ceived placebo 
in the SHP621 -301 i nduction study
To evaluate the effect of reinitiating OBS treatment for subjects who relapse after being 
randomized to placebo in the randomized withdrawal p eriod (treatment -withdrawal -treatment 
reinitiation)
To assess end oscopi[INVESTIGATOR_64646] b y the EoE Endoscopic 
Reference Score (EREFS)
To evaluate other responding criteria based on histology  and DSQ
To evaluate the long -term safet y and tolerability of OBS treatment

3. STUDY DESIGN
3.1 Study Design and Flow Chart
This is a Phas e 3, multicenter, double -blind study  to evaluate the efficacy , safet y and tolerability
of OBS treatment administered twice daily (qAM, pc, and hs) for 36weeks. The study  will be 
conducted in adolescents and adults, aged 11 -55years, inclusive, with EoE and dy sphagia who 
completed the SHP621-301 i nduction study .
Approximately  200 subjects (88%) who were randomized in the SHP621 -301 study  are 
estimated to complete the SHP621- 301 study  and will be enrolled in this treatment extension 
study  based on enrollment observed in the Phase 2 study  (MPI 101- 06).Randomization into the 
randomized withdraw al period will be stratified b y treatment assignment and treatment response 
in the SHP621 -301 study .Subjects who are full responders (defined as ≤6 eos/ HPF across all 
available esophageal levels and at least a 30% reduction in DSQ at the final treatment e valuation 
visit [Visit 4]) in the SHP621 -301 induction study will be eligible to enter the randomized 
withdrawal period to receive either OBS 2 mg twice dail y or placebo at a 1:1 ratio. The 
randomization of subjects who are full responders will also be str atified b y age (adults and 
adolescents) to ensure approximately  equal number of subjects within each age group are 
assigned to the treatment groups.
This study  will consist of 3 periods : 4-week screening period, 36 -week double -blind treatment 
period, and 4- week safety  follow -up
(Figure 3-
1).

Subjects will be required to visit the site up to 8times over up to a 36-week period. Following 
comple tion of the s creening visit, subjects will be evaluated for eligibility  and safet y at Week 0
(Visit 1). Subjects who are eligible and randomized will have efficacy  and safet y assessments at 
Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 28, and 36 (Visits 2-8) and additional safet y assessments at follow -up at 
Week 
40(Visit 9
). Subjects who fail to meet all e ligibility  criteria at Visits 0or 1will be 
considered screen failures . These subjects will receive a follow -up safet y phone call [ADDRESS_70236] been 
designated as a screen failure. Subjects who discontinue will not be replaced.
The screening period will start when subjects sign informed c onsent (or assent as applicable for 
subjects <18 years of age ; screening visit [Visit 0]) and will be 
≤4weeks in duration. During the 
screening period, assessments from the SHP621-301 f inal t reatment 
evaluation visit (Visit 4) will 
be used as the 
Visit 0 screening assessments of the treatment extension study . At the screening 
visit ( Visit 0 ), subjects who are on a PPI [INVESTIGATOR_64647] ; if they  are not taking a PPI, they  must remain off of a PPI [INVESTIGATOR_64648] y. 
Eligible subjects will receive investigational product based on treatment assignment in 
SHP621 -301 for up to 4 weeks prior to enrollment in the treatment extension study . This 4-week 
screening period is required to allow for blinded treatment response information (reduction in 
DSQ from baseline and eosinophilic count as determined by  a central reader) collected during 
the SHP621-301 f inal t reatment evaluation visit to be entered into the interactive web-based
response system (IWRS) . 
Only the un
blinded data team who is independent from the blinded 
study  team and not involved with the day -to-day conduct of the study will have restricted access 
to blinded treatment response information . Once response information is available, subjects will 
return for the r andomization visit (Visit 1 ) to receive investigational product. Subjects who 
continue to meet eligibility  criteria after the screening visit ( Visit 0 ) will enter the 36 -week 
double -blind treatment period.
Subjects who were assigned to OBS treatme nt and who f ully responded in the SHP621
-301 study  
(≤6 eos/ HPF across all available esophageal levels and at least a 30% reduction in DSQ at the 
final 
treatment e valuation visit) will enter a randomized withdrawal p eriod to receive either OBS 
2 mg twice daily or placebo at a 1:1 ratio. These subjects will also be stratified by  [CONTACT_654] (adults and 
adolescents). Subjects who were assigned to OBS treatment and did not respond or partiall y 
responded in the SHP621 -[ADDRESS_70237] DSQ data from the SHP621 -301 (post randomization) 
andthis extension st udy until the database locks occurs for this extension study . 
At Week 12, all subjects will undergo an upper esophagogastroduodenoscopy  (EGD) with 
biopsy  to evaluate eosinophil counts. Upon receipt of blinded EGD and DSQ data, subjects on 
placebo in the randomized withdrawal period who have relapsed will have their treatment 
assignment changed to OBS 2 mg twice dail yat the next scheduled visit . The criteria for relapse 
is having an eosinophilic count of ≥15 eos/ HPF from at least 2of [ADDRESS_70238] will remain assigned to placebo. The upper EGD with esophageal 
biopsies will be repeated at the Week 36 visit (Visit 8) or at earl y termination (ET) , to evaluate 
eosinophil counts. If an unscheduled EGD is performed between Week [ADDRESS_70239] to 
query  for SAEs, AEs, and concomitant treatments.
The upper limit of 55 years, inclusive, was selected for this study  population based on the low 
prevalence of EoE in older patients ( Dellon et al. 2014a ) and the fact that asEoE persists, it 
becomes more fibrostenotic in older patients and would not be amenable to a nti-inflammatory  
treatment alone (Dellon et al. 2014b). A natural history  study  demonstrated that for every  decade 
of life, the odds of developi[INVESTIGATOR_64649] 
(Dellon etal. 2014b ). By [CONTACT_654] 55, fibrostenotic EoE occurs in approximately  80% of patients. 
Fibrostenotic disease is treated with dilatation and is not amenable to anti -inflammatory  
treatment alone. Therefore, budes onide is not expected to be an effective treatment for the 
majority  of patients above age 55.
The design of this study  combines randomized withdrawal and long -term extension elements in a 
manner that selects appropriate patients for placebo withdrawal and maintains double -blinding of 
subjects in all treatment groups. Onl y subjects who are full responders to OBS 2 mg twice dail y
in the SHP621 -301 induction study (≤6 eos/ HPF across all available esophageal levels and at 
least a 30% reduction in DSQ at the f inal treatment evaluation visit of SHP621- 301), will be 
eligible for randomized withdrawal. The randomized withdrawal period i s required to assess 
maintenance of efficacy  in these subjects. The continuation of OBS [ADDRESS_70240] of reinitiating OBS treatment in these subjects. For subjects who relapse on placebo during 
the randomized withd rawal and who reinitiate treatment with OBS 2 mg twice dail y (intermittent 
therap y), separate descriptive anal yses for histological data and DSQ endpoints will be 
conducted at each assessment visit, as described in Section 9.8.2.
For all subjects, anesoph ageal 
stricture requiring dilation would be considered a treatment failure and result in withdrawal of 
the subject from the study . Subject withdrawal criteria are provide din Section 4.5.1.
3.[ADDRESS_70241]’s maximum dur ation of participation is expected to be approximately  [ADDRESS_70242] who completes all procedures and assessments up to and including Visit 
8(Week 36) , inclusive of the f inal treatment evaluation EGD .All subjects will have a f ollow -up 
phone call [ADDRESS_70243] participate in the informed consent process and provide written informed 
consent/assent before any procedures specified in the protocol are performed.

During the 4-week s creening period , blinded treatment response information (reduction in DSQ 
from baseline and eosinophilic count as determined by a central reader) c ollected dur ing the 
SHP621 -301 f inal t reatment evaluation v isit will be entered into the IWRS in a blinded manner . 
Once information is available in IWRS , subjects will return for the randomization visit (Visit 1) 
to be assigned to investigational product (OBS 2 mg twi ce daily  or placebo) .While only  
SHP621 -[ADDRESS_70275] via I WRS to maintain 
double -blinding of subjects, investig ators, the blinded monitoring team and the sponsor (ie, sham

The I WRS will also be used for creating, tracking, and confirm ing inve stigational product 
shipments. A user manual with specific functions and instructions for the IWRS will be provided 
to the site and site personnel will receive training.
The I WRS provider will provide a user manu
al and training to each site, with detailed 
instructions on use of the I WRS.
6.2.2 Allocation of Subjects to Treatment 
This study  consists of a 4-week screening period and a double -blind treatment period. 
The actual 
treatment given to individual subjects during the double -blind treatment period will be 
determined b y the blinded treatment response informa tion entered at the SHP621 -301 final 
treatment evaluation v isit.
Subjects will be randomized via a computer -generated randomization schedule at the 
randomizatio n visit (Visit 1) following a 4 -week screening period and confirmation of study  
eligibility . Subjects who fully  responded to OBS treatment in the SHP621 -301 study  
(≤6eos/HPF across all available esophageal levels and at least a 30% reduction in DSQ at the
final treatment evaluation visit) will enter a randomized withdrawal period to receive either OBS 
2mg twice daily  or placebo at a 1:[ADDRESS_70276] DSQ data from the SHP621
-301 study  (post
randomization) and until database lock occurs for this extension study . 
Randomization of subjects in the randomized withdrawal period will also be stratified b y age 
(adults and adolescents) to ensure approximately equal number of subjects within each age group 
are assigned to the treatment groups.
For non-commercial use only
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page [ADDRESS_70277] will occur twice 
daily (qAM, pc , and hs ), with no ingestion of food or liquids permitt ed for 30 minutes after stud y 
drug administration. Subjects randomized to OBS will receive 10 mL of 0.2 mg/mL
 of OBS 
(2mg) twice dail yfor a total daily  dose of 4 mg.
At Week 12, all subjects will undergo an upper esophagogastroduodenoscopy  (EGD) with 
biopsy to evaluate eosinophil counts. Upon receipt of blinded EGD and DSQ data, subjects on 
placebo in the randomized withdrawal period who have relapsed will have their treatment 
assignment changed to OBS 2 mg twice dail y. The criteria for relapse is having an eosinophil 
count of ≥15 eos/ HPF from at least [ADDRESS_70278] 4 day s of d ysphagia in the2-week period prior to the scheduled visit , 
as determined b y the DSQ. Considering the potenti al for missing diary
 entries, the determination 
of relapse based on day s of dy sphagia reported on the DSQ will occur as follows:
If at least [ADDRESS_70279] would meet the cri terion for dy sphagia sy mptom relapse . 
If less than [ADDRESS_70280] would not meet criterion for dysphagia s ymptom relapse . 
If less than 4 day s of d ysphagia a re reported in the DSQ and fewer than 8 diary  entries are 
recorded within the 2-
week period, the DSQ window can be expanded as described in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
The criteria for relapse align with the related inclusion criteria for participation in the SHP621 -
[ADDRESS_70281]’s treatment assignment will be changed in a

Prior to performing an y study-related procedures (including those related to screening), the 
investigator or his/her designee must obtain written informed consent from the subjec t (as per 
local requirements). There must be documentation of consent (as per local requirements) 
indicating that the subject is aware of the investigational nature of the study and the required 
procedures and restrictions, prior to performing any  study -related procedures.
7.1.1 Screening Period (Week s -4to 0)
The screening period starts when subjects sign informed consent. The screening period will 
comprise up to 4weeks, during which all procedures listed for the screening visit (Visit 0 ) in 
Table 1-[ADDRESS_70293]’s inclusion into the study .A subject shoul d not be instructed to discontinue use 
of an y medication or treatment to participate in this study until infor med consent has been 
obtained. Subjects should not stop permitted medications or treatments that are effective and well 
tolerated to participate i n this study (Section 5.2.1 ).
Assessments from the SHP621-301 final treatment evaluation visit (Visit 4) will be used as the 
screening assessments ( Visit 0 ) of this treatment extension study . Screening assessments may  
take place across several day s to allo w an appropriate time frame in which to complete all 
procedures and confirm study  eligibility . At the SHP621-
[ADDRESS_70294] (based on treatment assignment in 
SHP621 -301) that will last for up to 4 weeks prior to enrolling into t his treatment extension 
study . The 4-week screening period is required to allow for blinded treatment response 
information (reduction in DSQ from baseline and eosinophilic count as determined by  a centr al 
reader) collected during the SHP621 -301 final treatment evaluation visit to be entered into the 
IWRS .
After the s creening period, subjects who meet eligibility  criteria at the end of the screening visit
(Visit 0 ) will enter the 36-week double -blind trea tment period . This period should not commence 
until all screening assessments required to confirm initial eligibility  have been completed. If the 
subject does not meet eligibility  criteria following completion of screening assessments, the 
investigator or 
designee will document the subject as a screen failure in the I WRS.
A screen failure is a subject who has given informed consent and failed to meet the inclusion 
criteria and/or met at least [ADDRESS_70295] been designated as a screen

7.2.1 Efficacy
[IP_ADDRESS] Esophagogastroduodenoscopy with Esophageal Biopsy and 
Histopathologic Evaluation
The EGD with endoscopy  score and biops y will be performed during the study  as outlined in 
Table 1-1. 
The screening EGD with biopsies will be performed by a physician at the investigative site at the 
final treatment evaluation visit in the SHP621 -301study . Biops y specimens must be taken and 
provided to the central pathology  lab b y at least 2 weeks prior to the planned Visit 1 to allow 
sufficient t ime for processing and central review and determination of eligibility .Subjects, site 
staff, and stud y team members will remain blinded to eosinophil counts and histopathologic 
findings b y the central re ader throughout the duration of the study .
At the We ek 12 visit (Visit 4), and Week 36 visit (Visit 8) or at early  termination (ET), an EGD 
with esophageal biopsies is required for all subjects. If at an y time, the subject reports increased 
or worsening d ysphagia sy mptoms to the investigator, the investigat or may  chooseto perform an 
unscheduled EGD. If an unscheduled EGD is performed prior to Week 12, an EGD does not 
have to be repeated at Week 12. If an unscheduled EGD is performed between Week 12 and 
Week 36, the Week 36 EGD should still be performed
. Mul tiple specimens (at least 2 biopsies 
from each of 3 levels, 6 specimens total ) will be obtained from the proximal (3 cm below the 
cricophary ngeus muscle), midesophagus (midpoint between the cricopharyngeus muscle and the 
gastroesophageal junction), and dis
tal (3 cm above the gastroesophageal junction) .Biops y tissue 
will be placed in 3 separate vials (1 vial for each of the levels) and sent to the central pathology  
laboratory  for processing of tissue into slides . Eosinophil counts and, histopathologic featu res 
will be evaluated 
by [CONTACT_64755]. Eight h istopathologic epi[INVESTIGATOR_64658] (basal lay er hy perplasia, eosinophil density , eosinophil microabscesses, eosinophil 
surface lay ering , dilated intercellular spaces, surface epi[INVESTIGATOR_64659], dy skeratotic epi[INVESTIGATOR_15129], lamina propria fibrosis ) will be 
scored ona 4-point scale (0=normal, 3=worst) for both the 
severit y of the abnormality  (ie,grade) and the amount of tissue affected b y the abnormality (ie, 
stage) . 
Endoscopic findings with separate evaluations of the proximal and distal esophagus will be 
recorded with respect to [ADDRESS_70310] : 1) exudates or plaques (grade 0 –2); 2) 
fixed esophageal rings (grade 0 –
3); 3) edema (grade 0–2); 4) furrows (grade 
0–2); and 5) 
strictures (grade 0 –1).An endoscopy  score for each category  will be calculated and summed for 
each anatomic location (proximal and distal). The maximum endoscopy  score is [ADDRESS_70311]. At the i nvestigator’s discretion, b iopsies will be taken from the s tomach and 
duodenum as follows: gastri c body  (greater curvature): 2 specimens, gastric antrum: 
2 specimens, and duodenum (third part or distal): 2 specimens. Biopsies from the stomach should 
be submitted in 1vial; biopsies from the duodenum should be submitted in a separate vial to the 
centra l pathology  laboratory  for processing of tissue into slides. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Dysphagia Symptom Questionnaire
Subjects’ dy sphagia s ymptoms will be evaluated using a DSQ ePRO device ( Appendix 3 ). 
The questionnaire will be completed b y subjects daily  during the screening p eriod and during the 
36-week treatment period . Each evening before bedtime, subjects will be asked to indicate if they  
experienced d ysphagia sy mptoms ( eg, food passing slowl y or food sticking) during that day.
Subjects must fill out the DSQ at least 5or more daysduring a given week in order to be 
compliant. Visit to visit compliance of DSQ completion will also be assessed by  [CONTACT_8786]. 
Protocol deviations will be documented for subjects who fail to complete the DSQ for [ADDRESS_70312] 4 day s of d ysphagia as determined by  [CONTACT_64756] 2- week period prior to the scheduled visit in addition to meeting the eosinophil 
histology  criterion ( ≥15 eos/ HPF from at least 2of 3levels of the esophagus). Considering the 
potential for missing diary entries, the determination of relapse based on days o f dysphagia 
reported on the DSQ will occur as follows:
If at least [ADDRESS_70313] would meet the criterion for dysphagia sy mptom relapse . 
If less than [ADDRESS_70314] would not meet criterion for dysphagia s ymptom relapse . 
If less than [ADDRESS_70315] meets the criteria for dysphagia sy mptom
relapse over 14 consecutive day s; however, the [ADDRESS_70316] 8 diary  entries are recorded in the 14 -day period and will not be shifted by [CONTACT_726] 2 
weeks (ie, no more than 2
-week period plus addition
al 2-week additional expansion) .
Calculations will be perfo rmed on daily  ePRO entries during a 2-week interval prior to each 
study  visit during the treatment period . The DSQ score for the coprimary  endpoint and secondary  
endpoints will be calculated by  [CONTACT_64709] 2 and 3 only . 
Questions 1 and 4 will be excluded from the DSQ score:

period stated in Section 7.1.[ADDRESS_70323] be followed to closure (the subject’s health has returned to his/her baseline status 
or all variables have re turned to normal), regardless of whether the subject is sti ll participating in 
the study . Closure indicates that an outcome is reached, stabilization achieved (the investigator 
does not expect any  further improvement or worsening of the event), or th e even t is otherwise 
explained. When appropriate, medical tests and examinations are performed so that resolution of 
event(s) can be documented.

appropriate date of onset] is recorded on the appropriate CRF).
The medical assessment of severit y is determined by [INVESTIGATOR_1477]:
Mild: A type of AE that is usually  transient and may  require only  minimal treatmen t or 
therapeutic intervention. The event does not gene rally interfere with usual

Moderate: A type of AE that is usually  alleviated with specific therapeutic intervention. The 
event interferes with usual activities of daily  living, causing discomfort but poses 
no significant or perm anent risk of harm to the research subject.
Severe: A type of AE that interrupts usual activities of daily  living, or significantl y affects 
clinical status, or may  require intensive therapeutic intervention.

8.1.2 Relationship Categorization
A phy sician/investig ator must make the assessment of relationship to invest igational product for 
each AE. The investigator should decide whether, in his or her medical judgment, there is a 
reasonable possibility  that the event may  have been caused b y the investigational produ ct. If 
there is no valid reason for suggesting a relationship, then the AE should be classified as “not 
related .”Otherwise, if there is an y valid reason, even if undetermined or untested, for suspecting 
a possible cause -and-effect relationship between the investigational product and the occurrence 
of the AE, then the AE should be considered “related” based on the definitions in Table 8-1. The 
causality  assessment must be documented in the source document.
Table 8-1: Adverse Event Relatedness
Term Relationship Definition
Not Related Unrelated to study drug.
Possibly RelatedA clinical event or laboratory abnormality with a reasonable time sequence to 
administration of study drug, but which could also be expla ined by [CONTACT_64758].
Probably RelatedA clinical event or laboratory abnormality with a reasonable time sequence to 
administration of study drug, unlikely to be attributable to concurrent disease or other 
drugs and chemi cals and which follows a clinically reason able response on 
dechallenge. The association of the clinical event or laboratory abnormality must also 
have some biologic plausibility, at least on theoretical grounds.
Definitely RelatedThe event follows a reas onable temporal sequence from administration of the study 
drug, follows a known or suspected response pattern to the study drug, is confirmed 
by [CONTACT_48017][INVESTIGATOR_35648] (dechallenge), and reappears upon 
repeated exposure (rechallenge). Note that this is not to be construed as requiring 
reexposure of the patient to study drug; however, the determination of definitely

8.1.[ADDRESS_70326] to the start of study  treatment, 
further investigations should be performed until the values return to within the reference range or 
until a plausible explanation ( eg, concomitant disease) is found for the abnormal values.
The investigator should decide, based on the above criteria and the clinical condition of a 
subject, whether a change in a clinical laboratory or vital sign parameter is clinically  significant 
and therefore represents an AE.
8.1.[ADDRESS_70327] be reported within 24 hours to the 
Shire Global Pharmacovigilance and Risk Management Department using the Shire 
Investigational and Marketed Products Pregnancy  Report Form. A copy  of the Shire 
Investigational and Marketed Products Pregnancy  Report Form (and an y applicable follow -up 
reports) must also be sent to the CRO/Shire medical monitor using the details specified in the 
emergency  contact [CONTACT_1739]. The pregnant female study  participant 
must be withdrawn from the study .
Every  effort should be made to gather information regarding the pregnancy  outcome and 
condition of the i nfant. I t is the responsibility  of the investigator to obtain this information within 
30 calendar day s after the initial notification and approximatel y 30 calendar days postpartum.
Pregnancy  complications such as spontaneous abortion/miscarriage or congenital abnormality  
are considered SAEs and must be reported using the Shire Clinical Study  Adverse Event Form
for SAEs and Non -serious AEs as Required b y Protocol . Note: An elective abortion is not 
considered an SAE.
In addition to the above, if the investigator determines that the pregnancy  meets serious criteria, 
it must be reported as an SAE using the Shire Clinical Study  Adverse Event Form for SAEs and 
Non-serious AEs as Required by  [CONTACT_64759]. 
The test date of the first positive serum/urine -HCG test or

not apply  to reports of abuse, misuse, overdose, or medication errors (Section 8.1.7) unless they  
result in an SAE.
The investigator must complete, sign, and da te the Shire Clinical Study  Adverse Event Form for 
SAEs and Non- serious AEs as Required b y Protocol and verify  the accuracy  of the information 
recorded on the form with the corresponding source documents (Note: Source documents are not 
to be sent unless re quested) and fax or e- mail the form to the Shire Global Pharmacovigilance 
and Risk Management Department. A cop y of the Shire Clinical Study  Adverse Event Form for 
SAEs and Non- serious AEs as Required b y Protocol (and an y applicable follow -up reports ) must
also be sent to the CRO medical monitor using the details specified in the emergency  contact 
[CONTACT_1739].
8.2.3 Serious Adverse Event Definition
A Serious A dverse Event (SAE) is any  untoward medical occurrence (whether considered to be 
related to investigational product or not) that at any  dose:
Results in death
Is life -threatening. 
Note: The term “ life-threatening ” in the definition of “serious” refers to an 
event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it doe s not refer to an 
event which h ypothetically might have caused death if it was more severe.
Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3850]. Note: 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], which are the result of elective or previousl y scheduled sur gery for 
pre-existing conditions, which have not worsened after initiation of treatment, should not be 
classified as SAEs. For example, an admission for a previousl y scheduled ventral hernia 
repair would not be classified as an SAE; however, complication(s ) resulting from a 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10153] y scheduled surgery  that meet(s) serious criteria 
must be reported as SAE(s).
Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity .
Is a congenital abnormality /birth defect .
Is an importa nt medical event. Note: I mportant medical events that may  not result in death, 
be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10154], based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they  may  jeopardize the subject and may  require medical o r
surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outco mes listed in this definition. Examples of such 
medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency  
room or at home; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or the development of drug dependency  or drug abuse. 
8.2.4 Serious Adverse Event Collection Time Frame
All SAEs (regardless of relationship to study ) are collected from the time the subject signs the 
informed consent until the defi ned follow -up period stated in Section 7.1.[ADDRESS_70330] awareness of the event. 
For non-commercial use only
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 76
Protocol SHP621 -302, Am endment 1 22Jun 2016
In addition, any  SAE(s) considered “related ” to the investigational product and discovered by  [CONTACT_10194] y interval after the study has completed must be reported to the Shire Global 
Pharmacovigilance and Risk Management Department within [ADDRESS_70331]’s death ( ie,the SAE was noted as the primary  cause of death) 
must have “ fatal” checked as an outcome with the date of death r ecorded as the resolution date.
For all other events ongoing at the time of death that did not contribute to the subject’s death, the 
outcome should be considered as not resolved, without a resolution date re corded.
For an y SAE that results in the subject’s death or any ongoing events at the time of death, unless 
another investigational product action was previously  taken (eg, drug interrupted, reduced, 
withdrawn), the action taken with the investigational product should be recorded as “dose not 
changed” or “not applicable” (if the subject never received investigational product). The 
investigational product action of “withdrawn” should not be selected solel y as a result of the 
subject’s death. 
8.2.[ADDRESS_70332], Ethics Committee, and Site 
Reporting
Thesponsor and the clinical CRO are responsible for notify ing the relevant regulatory  
authorities/US central Institutional Review Boards ( IRBs)of related, unexpected SAEs.
In addition, the sponsor and the clinical CRO areresponsible for notify ing active sites of all 
related, unexpected SAEs occurring during all interventional studies across the SHP621
program . 
The investigator is responsible for notify ing the local IRB, local ethics committee ( EC), or the 
relevant local regulatory  authority  of all SAEs that occur at his or her site as required.

9. DATA MANAGEMENT AND STATISTICAL METHODS
9.1 Data Collection
The investigators’ authorized site personnel must enter the information requir ed by  [CONTACT_64760]. A study  monitor will visit each site in accordance with the monitoring plan and 
review the CRF data against the source data for completeness and accuracy .Discrepancies 
between source data and data entered on the CRF will be address ed by [CONTACT_1746].
When a data discrepancy warrants correction, the correction will be mad e by [CONTACT_59752]. Data collection procedures will be discussed with the site at the site initiation visit 
and/or at the investigator’s meeting. Once a subject is randomized, it is expected that site 
personnel will complete the CRF entry  within approximately  [ADDRESS_70333]’s 
visit.
9.2 Clinical Data Management
Data are to be entered into a clinical database as specified in the CRO’s data management plan.
Quality  control and data validation procedures are applied to ensure the validity  and accuracy  of 
the clinical database.
Data are to be reviewed and checked for omissions, errors, and values requiring further 
clarification using compu terized and manual procedures. Data queries requiring clarification are 
to be communicated to the site for r esolution. Only authorized personnel will make corrections to 
the clinical database, and all corrections are documented in an auditable manner.
9.3 Data Handling Considerations
Data that may  potentiall y unblind the treatment assignment ( ie,investigational product serum 
concentrations, treatment allocation, and investigational product preparation/accountability  data) 
will be handled with special care durin g the da ta cleaning and review process. These data will be 
handled in such a way  that, prior to unblinding, any  data that may  unblind study  team personnel 
will be presented as blinded information or otherw ise will not be made available. If applicable, 
unblinded data may  be made available to quality  assurance representatives for the purposes of 
conducting independent drug audits. 
9.4 Statistical Analysis Process
The study  will be anal yzed by  [CONTACT_10196]. All statistical anal yses will be performed 
using SAS®(SAS Institute, Cary , NC, [LOCATION_003]) version 9.3or higher.
The statistical analysis plan ( SAP)will provide the statistical methods and definitions for the 
analysis of the efficacy  and safet y data, as well as describe the approaches to be taken for 
summarizing other study  information such as subject disposition, demographics and baseline 
characteristics, investigational product exposure, and prior and concomitant medications. The 
SAP will also include a description of how missing, unused and spurious data will be addressed.
The SAP will be finalized prior to final database lock and performing analy sis (ie, unblinding )to 
preserve the integrit y of the statistical a nalysis and study  conclusions.

9.5 Planned Interim Analysis, Adaptive Design, and Data Monito ring Committee
No interim anal ysis is planned.
9.6 Sample Size Calculation and Power Considerations
Approximately  200 subjects (88%) who are randomized in the SHP621 -301 study  are estimated 
to complete the SHP621- 301 study  and enroll in this treatment extensio n study  based on 
enrollment observed in the Phase 2 study  (MPI 101 -06).
The primary  efficacy  measure of the stud y will be the proportion of subjects who relapse during
the double -blind randomized withdrawal period, defined as having an eosinophil count of 
≥15eos/HPF from at least 2of 3levels of the esophagus (as determined b y a central reader) and 
at least 4 day s of d ysphagia in the 2 -week period prior to the scheduled visit (as determined b y 
the DSQ ). To be considered as a subject with relapse , both cri teria must be met. To determine 
whether a subject meets the criterion for d ysphagia, refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS] .
Based on observation in the Phase 2 study  (MPI 101 -06), approximately  26% of subjects, or 
approximately  [ADDRESS_70334] a 
50 percentage point difference between relapse proportions of 20% and 70% in the OBS and 
placebo groups, respectively , at more than 80% power and a significance level of 0.05 (2- sided) 
using the Fisher’s Exact test with equal allocation to treatment groups, it is necessary  to assess 
the primary  efficacy  measure for approximately  38subjects (19 subjects in each of the OBS and 
placebo groups) . 
9.[ADDRESS_70335].
The intent -to-treat (ITT) setwill include all randomized subjects. Subjects will be analy zed 
according to their assigned treatment, regardless of the treatment actuall y received.
The full analysis set 
(FAS) will include all randomized subjects who received at least [ADDRESS_70336]
baseline efficacy  assessment (biopsy  and/or DS Q score) .
The per-protocol 
(PP) set will include all subjects in the FAS excluding subjects with major 
protocol deviat ions. The PP set will be identified prior to unblinding the treatment assignments 
by a team consisting of, at a minimum, a phy sician and a statistician from Shire. 
9.[ADDRESS_70337] is relapse during the double
-blind randomized 
withdrawal period. Relapse , a binary  response (either with a relapse or not), is defined as having 
an eosinophil count of ≥15eos/HPF from at least [ADDRESS_70338] 4 day s of dy sphagia in the 2 -week period prior to the 
scheduled visit, as determined by  [CONTACT_941] D SQ(refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS]).
The primary  efficacy endpoint will be analy zed as the proportion of subjects with relapse during
the double- blind randomized withdrawal period for the FAS, using a Fisher’s Exact test 
comparing OBS [ADDRESS_70339] will be 
2-sided, and conducted at the significance level of 0.05. The proportion of subjects with relapse 
for each treatment group and the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) will be estimated. 
In addition, the difference in the proportion of subjects with relapse between the 2 treatment 
groups and its 95% CI will be estimated.
Subjects who withdraw without providing efficacy data at the ET visit will be classified as being
relapse rsin the primary  efficacy  anal ysis. The null hypothesis states that there is no difference in 
relapse proportions between OBS [ADDRESS_70340] ying the Fisher’s Exact test to the observed data at each 
double -blind visit.
The following sensitivity and supportive anal yses will be performed for the primary  endpoint to 
evaluate the robustness of the results from the primary  anal ysismethods.
Similar a nalyses used for the ITT population will be repeated using the FAS and the PP datasets. 
Sensitivity  analyses will be performed using the ITT population by [CONTACT_64761]- relapsers. In addition, the
subjects who were prematurely  withdrawn from the study  without the primary  efficacy  endpoint 
will be imputed randomly according to the distribution of re lapser s with available data ; and the 
similar statistical test will b e performed using the imputed data .
9.8.2
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints
[IP_ADDRESS] Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoint
The key  secondary  efficacy  endpoint is the long- term treatment response , a binary  response over 
an extended period of 36 weeks in adolescent and adult subjects who were randomized to OBS 
treatment but did not respond after 12 weeks inthe SHP621 -
301 induction study (subject did not 
have peak count of ≤6 eos/HPF across all available esophageal levels at the final treatment visit 
and/or ≥30% reduction in DSQ score from baseline ) and met the following criteria
:
Histologic response, defined as a peak eosinophil count of ≤6eos/HPF across all available 
esophageal levels at the final treatment period evaluation (Visit 8)
Dysphagia s ymptom response, defined as ≥30% redu
ction in the DSQ combined score 
(questions 2+3) from baseline of the SHP621- 301 study  and from baseline of this extension

The key secondary  efficacy  endpoint will be anal yzed as the proportion of sub
jects who 
responded based on the histological data and the DSQ data at the final treatment period 
evaluation (Visit 8) . The proportion of subjects with long -term treatment response and the 
corresponding 95% confidence interval ( CI)will be estimated and summarized.

Summary  statistics of the DSQ s core (questions 2+3) and the peak eosinophil count and the 
change from baseline of the SHP621- 301 study  and from baseline of this extension study  at the 
final treatment period evaluation (Visit 8) will be summarized by  [CONTACT_64678] . 
To evaluate t he response to OBS treatment over 36 weeks for subjects who were on placebo in 
the SHP621-301 i nduction study ,the proportion of subjects who responded based on t he 
histological data and the DSQ data at the final treatment period evaluation (Visit 8) and t he 
corresponding 95% CI will be summarized. Summary  statistics of the DSQ score (questions 2+3) 
and the peak eosinophil count and the change from baseline of the SHP621 -301 study  and from

summarized by  [CONTACT_64678] . 
For subjects who relapse on placebo during the randomized withdrawal and who reinitiate 
treatment with OBS 2 mg twice dail y (intermittent therap y), separate descriptive analyses for 
histological data and DSQ endpoints will be conducted at each assessment visit. Changes will be 
summarized over time from baseline of the SHP621- 301 study  and from the time of relapse. The 
same criteria for response will be applied to these subjects ( ≤6 eos/ HPF across all available 
esophageal levels and at l east a 30% reduction in DSQ from SHP621 -301 baseline score).

9.9 Safety Analyses
Safety  data will be presented for the safet y set by [CONTACT_1570].
The safet y data collected at the randomization visit (Visit 1), or at the screening visit (Visit 0) if 
not collected at Visit 1,willbe used as the baseline value for safety  anal yses.
TEAEs are defined as AEs that start or deteriorate on or after the first dose of investigational 
product and no later than [ADDRESS_70341]. However, for 
any subjects who die during the study  (ie, the date of death is between the date of first dose of 
investigational pro duct and the date of study  discontinuation entered by  [CONTACT_779], inclusive), all 
AEs (including those resulting in death) that occur during the study  will be considered as TEAEs 
irrespective of the last dose and will be included in the TEAE summaries.
AEs will be coded using MedDRA . The number of events, incidence, and percentage of TEAEs 
will be calculated overall by  [CONTACT_9313], preferre d term, and treatment group. TEAEs
will be further summarized by  [CONTACT_11370] y and relationsh ip to investigational prod uct. AEs related to 
investigational product, AEs leading to withdrawal, SAEs, and deaths will be similarly 
summarized/listed.

10.3 Ethical Considerations
10.3.1 Informed Consent
It is the responsibility  of the investigator to obtain written informed consent (or assent as 
applicable for subjects <18 yearsof age ) from all study  subjects prior to any study -related 
procedures includ ing screening assessments. All consent documentation must be in accordance 
with applicable regulations and GCP. Each subject or the subject’s legall y authorized 
representative, as applicable, is requested to sign and date the subject ’sinformed consent form or 
a certified translation , if applicable, after the subject has received and read (or been read) the 
written subject information and received an explanation of what the study  involves, including but 
not limited to the objectives, potential benefits and risk, inconveniences, and the subject’ s rights 
and responsibilities. A copy  of the informed consent documentation ( ie,a complete set of subject 
information sheets and fully  executed signature [CONTACT_1787]) must be given to the subject or the 
subject’s legall y authorized representative, as applicable. This document may  require transl ation 
into the local language. Signed consent forms must remain in each subject’s study  file and must 
be available for verification at an y time.
With in the source documents, site personnel should document instruction of and understanding 
by [CONTACT_7071] s/legall yauthorized representative/caregiver of the safe, responsible storage and 
administration of investigational product to the study  subject.
The pri ncipal investigator provides the sponsor with a copy  of the consent form consent (or 
assent as applicable for subjects <18 years of age )that was reviewed b y the I RB/EC and received 
their favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]/approval. A cop y of the IRB ’s/EC’s written favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]/approval 
of these documents must be provided to the sponsor, prior to the start of the study  unless it is 
agreed to and documented (abiding b y regulatory  guidelines and national provisions) prior to 
study  start that another party  (ie,sponsor or coordinating principal investigator) is responsible for 
this action. Additionally , if the I RB/EC requires modification of the sample subject information 
and consent document provided by  [CONTACT_456], the documentation supporting this requirement 
must be pr ovided to the sponsor.
10.3.[ADDRESS_70345] or Ethics Committee
For sites outside the EU, it is the responsibility  of the investigator to submit this protocol, the 
informed consent document (approved b y the sponsor or their designee), relevant suppor ting 
information ,and all ty pes of subject recruitment information to the I RB/EC for review, and all 
must be approved prior to site initiation .
For sites within the EU, the applicant for an EC opi[INVESTIGATOR_64661] ,
for multicen ter studies , the coordinating principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_10157], according to national 
provisions.
Responsibility  for coordinating with IRBs/ECs is defined in the investigator agreement.
Prior to implementing changes in the study, the sponsor and the IRB/EC must approve an y 
revisions of all informed consent (or assent as applicable for subjects <18 years of age ) 
documents and amendments to the protocol unless there is a subject safet y issue.
For non-commercial use only
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page [ADDRESS_70346] supplies will not be released until the CRO has received written IRB/EC 
approval of and copi[INVESTIGATOR_10158].
For sites outside the EU, the investigator is responsible for keepi[INVESTIGATOR_1683]/EC apprised of the 
progress of the stud y and of an y changes made to the protocol, but in an y case at le ast once a 
year; for sites within the EU, this can be done by  [CONTACT_64729] ,for 
multicenter studies , the coordinating principal investigator, acc ording to national provisions. The 
investigator must also keep the local IRB/EC informed of an y serious and significant AEs.
10.[ADDRESS_70347] to the CRO/sponsor .
The confidentialit y of records that may be able to identify subjects will be protected in 
accordance with applicable laws, regulations, and guidelines.
After subjects have consented to take part in the study , the sponsor and/or its representatives 
reviews their medical records and data collected during the stud y.These records and data may , in 
addition, be reviewed b y others including the following: independent auditors who validate the 
data on behalf of the sponsor; third parties with whom the sponsor may  develop, register, or 
market SHP621 ; national or local regulatory  authorities; and the I RBs/ECs which gave appr oval 
for the stud y to proceed. The sponsor and/or its representatives accessing the reco rds and data 
will take all reasonable precautions in accordance with applicable laws, regulations, and 
guidelines to maintain the confidentialit y of subjects’ identities.
Subjects are assigned a unique identifying number; however, their initials and date o f birth may  
also be collected and used to assist the sponsor to verify  the accuracy  of the data ( eg,to confirm 
that laboratory  results have been assigned to the correct subject).
The results of studies –containing subjects’ unique identify ing number, rel evant medical 
records, and possibly  initials and dat es of birth – will be recorded. They  may  be transferred to 
and used in other countries which may  not afford the same level of protection that applies within 
the countries where this study  is conducted. The purpose sof an y such transfer would include 
support ingregulatory  submissions, conduct ingnew data analy ses to publish or present the study  
results, or answer ingquestions asked by  [CONTACT_64730].
10.5 Study Results/Publication Policy
Shire will endeavor to publish the results of all qualify ing, applicable, and covered studies 
according to external guidelines in a timely  manner regardless of whether the outcomes are

STUDY SYNOPSIS
Protocol num ber: SHP621 -302 Drug: SHP621, oral budesonide s uspension (OBS )
Title of the study: A Phase 3, Multicenter, Double -blind Extension Study to Ev aluate Maintenance of Efficacy of 
Oral Bud esonide Suspension (OBS ) and Long -term Treatm ent Effect of OBS in Adolescent and Adult Subjects (11 
to 55 Years of Age, Inclusive) w ith Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE)
Number of subjects (total and for each treatm ent arm):
Approximately 200 subjects (88%) who are randomized in the SHP621 -301 study are estimated to complete the 
SHP621 -301 study and enroll in this treatment extension study based on enrollment observed in the Phase 2 study 
(MPI 101 -06).
Investigator(s) : Multicenter study
Site(s) and Region(s ):
Approximately 60sites in North America
Study period (planned):
April 2016 –April 2019Clinical phase: 3
Objectives
Primary:
To evaluate the maintenance of efficacy over 36 w eeks, as measured by [CONTACT_64744] (DSQ) score, through a randomized withdraw al design for subjects who 
responded to 12 w eeks of OBS treatment (2 mg twice daily) w ith a peak count of ≤6 eosinophils 
(eos)/high -powered field (HPF) across all available esophageal levels at the final treatment visit and a ≥30% 
reduction in DSQ score from baseline during the SHP621 -301 induction study
Key Secondary:
To evaluate the long -term treatm ent response over an extended period of 36 w eeks for subjects who were 
randomized to OBS treatment but did not respond after 12 weeks in the SHP621 -301 induction study (subject 
did not have a peak count of ≤6 eos/HPF across all available esophageal levels at the fi nal treatment visit and/or 
a ≥30% reduction in DSQ score from baseline )
Secondary:
To evaluate the response to OBS treatment over 36 w eeks for subjects w ho received placebo in the SHP621 -301 
induction study
To evaluate the effect of reinitiating OBS treatm ent for subjects who relapse after being randomized to placebo 
in the random ized withdraw al period (treatment- withdrawal -treatment reinitiation)
To assess endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_64666] 
(EREF S)
To evaluate other respon secriteria based on histology and DSQ
To evaluate the long -term safety and tolerability of OBS treatment

Rationale:
Currently there is no approved medication for the treatment of EoE. This Phase [ADDRESS_70365], dose, and m ode of administration :
The a ssessments from the SHP621 -301 final treatment evaluation v isit (Visit 4) will be used as the screening
assessments (Visit 0) of t his treatm ent e xtension study. At the SHP621 -[ADDRESS_70366] (based on treatment assignment in SHP621 -301) that w ill last for 
up to 4 w eeks prior to enrolling into t his treatment e xtension study. A 4-week s creening period is required to allow  
for blinded treatment response information (reduction in DSQ from baseline and eosinophilic count as determined 
by a central reader) collected during the SHP621 -301 final treatment evaluation v isit to be entered into the 
interactive web-based response system (IWRS) . Only the un blinded data team who is independent from the blinded 
study team and not involved with the day -to-day conduct of the study will have restri cted access to blinded 
treatment response information . Once information is available in IWRS , subjects w ill return for the random ization 
visit (Visit 1) to receive investigational product as follows:
Subjects who were assigned to OBS treatment and who full y responded in the SHP621 -301 study ( ≤6 eos/ HPF
across all available esophageal levels and at least a 30% reduction in DSQ at the final treatment evaluation visit) 
will enter a randomized withdraw al period to receive either OBS 2 mg twice daily or placebo at a 1:1 ratio
Subjects who were assigned to OBS treatment and did not respond or partially responded to OBS treatment in 
the SHP621 -301 study wil l receive OBS 2 mg twice daily
Subjects who were assigned to placebo in the SHP621 -[ADDRESS_70367] DSQ data from the SHP621 -301study (post randomization) and this extension 
study until database lock occurs for this exten sion study . 
During the 36 -week double -blind treatment extension study, s ubjects will receive oral administration of 10 mL of 
0.2mg/mL (2 mg) investigational product twice daily (every morning [qAM] after meals [breakfast, pc] and at 
bedtime [hs] ; 4 mg to tal/day ), with no ingestion of food or liquids permitted for [ADDRESS_70368] administration . Dosing regimens are consistent with the regimens used in the Phase 2 MPI 101 -06 stu dy and 
Phase 3 SHP621 -301 study :
Placebo twice -daily group: placebo qAM (pc) and hs
OBS twice-daily group: OBS 10 mL of 0.2 mg/mL (2 mg) qAM (pc) and hs (4mg OBS total/day)
The investigational product will be supplied in amber glass, multidose bottles with child -resistant caps and 
refrigerated throughout the study (in the clinic and subject’s home) . Each bottle will contain approximately 210 mL 
of suspension with a budesonide concentration of 0.2 mg/mL, or 0.00 mg/mL (matching placebo). 
The total daily dose of budesonide will be [ADDRESS_70369] in

At Week 12, all subjects w ill undergo an upper esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with biopsy to evaluate 
eosinophil counts. Upon rece ipt of blinded EGD and DSQ data, subjects on placebo in the randomized withdrawal 
period who have relapsed will have their treatment assignment changed to OBS 2 mg twice daily . The criteria for 
relapse is having an eosinophilic count of ≥15 eos/ HPF from at least [ADDRESS_70370] 4 days of dysphagia in the 2 -week period prior to the scheduled visit , as 
determined by [CONTACT_64676]. Considering the potential for missing diary entries, the determinati on of relapse based on 
days of dysphagia reported on the DSQ will occur as follows:
If at least [ADDRESS_70371] w ould 
meet the criterion for dysphagia symptom relapse. 
If les s than [ADDRESS_70372] w ould not meet the criterion for dysphagia symptom relapse. 
If less than [ADDRESS_70373]’s treatment 
assignment will be changed in a blinded manner from placebo to OBS 2 mg twice daily at the subsequent study visit . 
If the W eek 12 or an unschedule d EGD reveal san eosinophil count of ≥[ADDRESS_70374]’s treatment assignment will be changed to OBS 2 mg twice daily at the next 
scheduled visit.
Methodology:
This is a Phase 3, double -blind, multicenter study to evaluate the e fficacy, safety, and tolerability of twice daily
administration of OBS (qAM, pc , and hs) in adolescents and adults aged 11 -55 years, inclusive, with EoE and 
dysphagia who completed the SHP621 -301 induction study . 
This study will comprise 3 periods: 4-weekscreening period , 36-week double -blind treatment period , and a 4 -week 
safety follow -up(Study Design Flow Chart ). All subjects who have completed the SHP621 -301 induction study will 
be eligible to enroll in this extension study. Approximately 200subjects (88%) who were randomized in the 
SHP621 -301 study are estimated to complete the SHP621 -301 study and w ill be enrolled in this treatment extension 
study based on enrollment observed in the Phase 2 study (MPI 101 -06).Randomization into the randomized 
withd rawal period will be stratified by [CONTACT_64675]621 -301 study.
Subjects who are full responders (defined as ≤6 eos/ HPF across all available esophageal levels and at least a 30% 
reduction in DSQ at the final treatmen t evaluation visit [Visit 4]) in the SHP621 -301 induction study will be eligible 
to enter the randomized withdraw al period to receive either OBS 2 mg twice daily or placebo at a 1:1 ratio. The 
randomization of subjects who are full responders will also be stratified by [CONTACT_654] (adults and adolescents) to ensure 
approximately equal number of subjects w ithin each age group areassigned to the treatment groups .
Subjects who sign informed consent (or assent as applicable for subjects <18 years) will be screened (Vi sit0); 
assessments from the SHP621 -301 final treatment e valuation visit (Visit 4) will be used as the Visit 0 screening 
assessments of the treatment extension study . Subjects who meet eligibility criteria at the screening visit (Visit 0) 
will enter the [ADDRESS_70375] based on treatment 
assignment in SHP621 -301 for up to 4 w eeks prior to enrollment in the treatmen t extension study. This 4 -week 
screening period is required to allow  for blin ded treatment response information (reduction in DSQ from baseline 
and eosinophilic count as determined by a central reader) collected during the SHP621 -[ADDRESS_70376] restricted access to blinded treatment 
response information .Once information is available in IWRS , subjects will return for the randomization visit (Vis it 
1) to receive investigational product .
During the 36 -week treatment extension study, subjects who were assigned to, and fully responded to OBS 
treatment in the SHP621 -301 study ( ≤6eos/HPF across all available esophageal levels and at least a 30% reduct ion 
in DSQ at the final treatment evaluation visit) w ill enter a randomized withdraw al period to receive either OBS 2 mg 
twice daily or placebo at a 1:1 ratio. Subjects w ho were assigned to OBS treatment in the SHP621 -301 study and d id 
not respond or parti ally responded , will receive OBS 2 mg twice daily . Subjects who were assigned to placebo in the 
SHP621 -301 study will receive OBS 2 mg twice daily . At Week 12, all subjects w ill undergo an upper 
esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) w ith biopsy to evaluate eosi nophil counts. Upon receipt of blinded EGD and 
DSQ data, subjects on placebo in the randomized withdraw al period who have relapsed (>15 eos/ HPF from at least 
2 levels of the esophagus and specimens and 4 days of dysphagia over 2 weeks) will have their treatm ent assignment 
changed to OBS [ADDRESS_70377]’s treatment assignment w ill be changed in a blinded manner from placebo to OBS [ADDRESS_70378].

Statistical Methodology for Prim ary Efficacy Endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint will be analyzed as the proportion of subjects withrelapse during the end of the 
double- blind randomized withdraw al period for the FAS, using Fisher’s Exact test comparing OBS [ADDRESS_70394] will be 2-sided, and conducted at the significance level of 0.05.
Theproportion of subjects w ith relapse for each treatment group and the corresponding 95% confidence interval 
(CI) w ill be estimated. In addition, the difference in the proportion of subjects with relapse betw een the 2treatment 
groups and its 95% CI will be estimated.
Subjects who withdraw  without providing efficacy data at the e arly termination (ET) v isit w ill be classified as being 
a relapser in the primary efficacy analysis. The null hypothesis states that there is no difference in relapse
proportions bet ween OBS 2 mg twice daily and placebo, with the 2-sided alternative of a nonzero difference 
betw een groups. Relapse proportions at each adjacent double- blind visit interval will also be assessed by [CONTACT_64746]’s Exact test to the observed data at each double- blind visit.
The follow ing sensitivity and supportive analyses will be performed for the prim ary endpoint to evaluate the 
robustness of the results from the primary analysis methods.
Similar analyses used for the ITT population w ill be repeated using the FAS and the PP datasets. Sensitivity 
analyses will be performed using the ITT population by [CONTACT_64770] -relapsers. Sensitivity analyses will be performed using the ITT p opulation by 
[CONTACT_64771] -relapsers.  In addition, the subjects who were prematurely withdrawn from the study 
without the prima ry efficacy endpoint will be imputed randomly according to the distribution of relapsers with 
available data; and the similar statistical test will be performed using the imputed data.  
Statistical Methodology for Key Secon dary and Other Secondary Efficacy Endpoint s
To evaluate the long -term treatm ent response over an extended period of 36 w eeks forsubjects who were 
randomized to OBS treatment but did not respond after 12 weeks in the SHP621 -301 induction study (subject did 
not have peak count of ≤6 eos/HPF across all available esophageal levels at the final treatment visit and/or ≥30% 
reduction in DSQ score from baseline of SHP621 -301), the proportion of subjects who responded based on the 
histological dat a and the DSQ data at the final treatment period evaluation (Visit 8) and the corresponding 95%

histological data and the DSQ data at the final treatment period evaluation (Visit 8) and the corresponding 95% CI 
will be summarized.
Summary statistics will be provided for all the secondary endpoints.
Statistical Methodology for Safety Endpoints 
All safety measures, including AEs, physical examination, stadiometry, vital signs (temperature, systolic and 
diastolic blood pressure, pulse, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]), w eight and height assessments, DXA scans for BMD and body 
composition measurements (for adolescents aged 11 -17 years, inclusive), clinical laboratory results (hematology, 
chemistry, urinalysis; serum pregnancy test, if appropriate), and ACTH stimulation will be descriptively 
summarized by [CONTACT_64723].
The number and percent of subjects wit h TEAEs will be presented. TEAEs are defined as AEs that start or 
deteriorate on or after the date of the first dose of investigational product (Visit 1) and no later than [ADDRESS_70396]. How ever, for any subjects who die during the study ( ie, the date of death is 
betw een the date of first dose of investigational product and the date of study discontinuation entered by [CONTACT_779], 
inclusive), all AEs (including those resulting in death) that occur during the study will be considered as TEAEs 
irrespective of the last dose and w ill be included in the TEAE summaries. 
Sample Size Justification
Approximately 200 subjects (88%) w ho are randomized in the SHP621 -301 study are estimated to complete the 
SHP621 -301 study and en roll in this treatment extension study based on enrollment observed in the Phase 2 study 
(MPI 101 -06).
The primary efficacy measure of the study will be the proportion of subjects who relapse during the double- blind 
randomized withdrawal p eriod . Relapse , abinary response (either with relapse or not), is defined as having an 
eosinophil count of ≥15eos/HPF from at least 2 of 3 levels of the esophagus (determined by a central reader) and 
having at least 4 days of dysphagia in a 2 -week period prior to the sch eduled visit (determined by [CONTACT_64676]) . To be 
considered as a subject w ith relapse , both criteria must be met.
Based on observation in the Phase 2 study (MPI 101 -06), approximately 26% of subjects, or approximately [ADDRESS_70397] a 50 percentage point difference between relapse proportions of 20% and 70% in the OBS 
and placebo groups, respectively, at more than 80% pow er and a significance level of 0.05 ( 2-sided) using the 
Fisher’s Exact test with equal allocation to treatment groups, it is necessary to assess the primary efficacy measure 
for approximately 38 subjects ([ADDRESS_70398] acebo groups).

1. BACKGROUND INFORMATI ON
1.1 Indication and Current Treatment Options 
Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is defined as “a chronic, immune/antigen -mediated esophageal 
disease characterized clinically  by [CONTACT_64749]- predominant inflammation” ( Liacouras et al .2011 ).Clinical 
symptoms of EoE often vary  by [CONTACT_654]: Infants and toddlers present with feeding difficulties; 
school -aged children are more likely  to present with vomiting or pain; and adolescents and adults 
present with d ysphagia and fo od impaction. Wh en these sy mptoms are present, the diagnosis is 
confirmed b y finding eosinophilic inflammation of ≥15 eosinophils/high- power edfield (HPF) on 
at least 1 esophageal biopsy  and when other causes such as proton pump inhibitor (PPI )-
responsive esophageal eosin ophilia are excluded ( Dellon et al. 2014a ; Furuta et al . 2007). The 
standards of care are diet therapi[INVESTIGATOR_64617]- label use of glucocorticosteroids .Esophageal dilati on 
is used to temporarily  relieve sy mptoms but does not ad dress underl ying inflammation. Given 
the clinical outcomes associated with EoE, including severe d ysphagia, esophageal stricture, 
food impaction, and esophageal perforation ( Hirano and Aceves 2014; Liacouras et al. 2011) and 
the fact that there are currently  no FDA -approved treatments, there is a clear unmet medical need 
for an approved treatment that induces and maintains remission for patients with EoE 
(Furu taand Katzka 2015 ). 
1.[ADDRESS_70403] Background and Clinical Information
Oral budesonide suspension (OBS) consists of budesonide formulated in a viscous suspension 
that is designed to increase the residence time of budesonide on the surface of the esophagus 
after swallowing compared to a nonviscous suspension. S hire is developi[INVESTIGATOR_64618] a first -line 
therap y for EoE in adolescents and adults.
The nonclinical pharmacology , pharmacokinetics, and toxicity  and the clinical pharmacology , 
pharmacokinetics, and safety  of budesonide are well studied because budesonide is present in 
several US FDA -approved drug products. Budesonide is currentl y marketed for the management 
of Crohn’s 
disease, for asthma maintenance, for the treatment of allergic rhinitis, and for 
induction of remission in patients with active, mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. Budesonide 
has strong glucocorticoid receptor affinity and is subject to considerable firs t pass metabolism by  
[CONTACT_64683] a short half -life. These attributes permit budesonide to act rapi[INVESTIGATOR_64644]’s disease and ulcerative 
colitis. Once absorbed into the sy stemic c irculation, budesonide is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_64645] ( FDA 2011).
The efficacy  of OBS for the treatment of EoE has been demonstrated in 
2 Phase 2 studies in the 
OBS clinical development program. Studies MPI 101-01 and MPI 101-06 evalua ted the efficacy  
of OBS in the treatment of EoE in children and adolescents aged 2 -18 years and in adolescents 
and adults aged 11- 40 years, respectivel y, by [CONTACT_64684] (defined as mean 
peak eosinophil count ≤6 eos/HPF after treatment). Study  MPI 101- 06 also evaluated s ymptom 
response as measured b y the Dy sphagia S ymptom Questionnaire (DSQ). The DSQ contains 4 
questions related to consumption of solid food, the presence of d ysphagia and its severity , as
well as pain. The DSQ score 
is calculated onl y from responses to the questions related to

dysphagia , and this clinical outcome assessment was considered to be fit for purpose as a result 
of the MPI 101-06 study . Results from Study  MPI 101-01 demonstrated a statistically significant 
histologic response (eosinophil count ≤6eos/HPF) and remission (eosinophil count ≤1 eos/HPF) 
in the medium- dose (1.4 -2.0mg dail y) and high -dose (2.8-4.0mg daily) OBS groups compared 
to placebo following [ADDRESS_70404] for OBS vs placebo was shown for both the 
coprimary  efficacy  endpoints ofhistologic response and change from baseline in dy sphagia 
symptoms. Following 12 weeks of twice daily treatment (once every morning after meal s[qAM, 
pc] and at bedtime [hs]), OBS -treated subjects demonstrated a highly  consistent reduction from 
baseline values for cellular (mean peak eosinophil count and histopathology features), organ 
(endoscop y score)
,and holistic measures (Phy sician Global As sessment and DSQ scores); these 
results were independent of the ty pe of rater/reviewer (central pathologist, phy sician at the study  
site, or subject). 
This Phase 3 extension study  follows the SHP621 -301 induction study , a Phase 3 randomized, 
double -blind, multicenter, study to evaluate the efficacy , safet y, and tolerability  of twice dail y 
administration of OBS (qAM, pc, and hs) in adolescents and adults aged 11 -55 years, inclusive, 
with EoE and dy sphagia . Study  SHP621-301 is designed to provide safet y and efficacy  data 
demonstrating histologic response (as measured by  [CONTACT_64686] ≤6eos/HPF) and 
improvement in dy sphagia sy mptoms (as measured by  [CONTACT_64676]) following [ADDRESS_70405] version of the SHP621 investigator’s brochure for the overall 
risk/benefit assessment and the most accurate and current information regarding the drug 
metabolism, pharmacokinetics, efficacy ,and safety of SHP621.

2. STUDY OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE
2.1 Rationale for the Study
Currently  there is no approved medication for the treatment of EoE. This Phase 3 study  is being 
condu cted to determine response to withdrawal of OBS, maintenance of response, extended 
therap y response, and response to intermittent therapy  by [CONTACT_64750] .
2.2 Study Objectives
2.2.1 Primary Objective
The primary objective of the study  is:
To evaluate the maintenance of efficacy  over 36 weeks, as measured by  [CONTACT_64751] (DSQ) score, through a randomized 
withdrawal design for subjects who responded to 12 weeks of OBS treatment (2 mg twice 
daily ) with a peak count of ≤6 eosinophils (eos)/high- powered field (HPF) across all 
available esophageal levels at the final treatment visit and a ≥
30% reduction in DSQ score 
from baseline during the SHP621 -301 i nduction study
2.2.2 Secondary Objectives
The key secondary  objective of this study  is:
To evaluate the long -term treatment response over an extended period of 36 weeks for 
subjects who were randomized to OBS tre atment but did not respond after 12 weeks in the 
SHP621 -301 i nduction study  (subject did not have 
a peak count of ≤6 eos/HPF across all 
available esophageal levels at the final treatment visit and/or a ≥30% reduct ion in DSQ score 
from baseline)
Additional secondary  objectives of the study  are:
To evaluate the response to OBS treatment over 36 weeks for subjects who re ceived placebo 
in the SHP621 -301 i nduction study
To evaluate the effect of reinitiating OBS treatment for subjects who relapse after being 
randomized to placebo in the randomized withdrawal p eriod (treatment -withdrawal -treatment 
reinitiation)
To assess end oscopi[INVESTIGATOR_64646] b y the EoE Endoscopic 
Reference Score (EREFS)
To evaluate other responding criteria based on histology  and DSQ
To evaluate the long -term safet y and tolerability of OBS treatment

3. STUDY DESIGN
3.1 Study Design and Flow Chart
This is a Phas e 3, multicenter, double -blind study  to evaluate the efficacy , safet y and tolerability
of OBS treatment administered twice daily (qAM, pc, and hs) for 36weeks. The study  will be 
conducted in adolescents and adults, aged 11 -55years, inclusive, with EoE and dy sphagia who 
completed the SHP621-301 i nduction study .
Approximately  200 subjects (88%) who were randomized in the SHP621 -301 study  are 
estimated to complete the SHP621- 301 study  and will be enrolled in this treatment extension 
study  based on enrollment observed in the Phase 2 study  (MPI 101- 06).Randomization into the 
randomized withdraw al period will be stratified b y treatment assignment and treatment response 
in the SHP621 -301 study .Subjects who are full responders (defined as ≤6 eos/ HPF across all 
available esophageal levels and at least a 30% reduction in DSQ at the final treatment e valuation 
visit [Visit 4]) in the SHP621 -301 induction study will be eligible to enter the randomized 
withdrawal period to receive either OBS 2 mg twice dail y or placebo at a 1:1 ratio. The 
randomization of subjects who are full responders will also be str atified b y age (adults and 
adolescents) to ensure approximately  equal number of subjects within each age group are 
assigned to the treatment groups.
This study  will consist of 3 periods : 4-week screening period, 36 -week double -blind treatment 
period, and 4- week safety  follow -up
(Figure 3-

Subjects will be required to visit the site up to 8times over up to a 36-week period. Following 
comple tion of the s creening visit, subjects will be evaluated for eligibility  and safet y at Week 0
(Visit 1). Subjects who are eligible and randomized will have efficacy  and safet y assessments at 
Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 28, and 36 (Visits 2-8) and additional safet y assessments at follow -up at 
Week 40 (Visit 
9). Subjects who fail to meet all e ligibility  criteria at Visits 0or 1will be 
considered screen failures . These subjects will receive a follow -
up safet y pho ne call [ADDRESS_70406] been 
designated as a screen failure. Subjects who discontinue will not be replaced.
The screening period will start when subjects sign informed consent (or assent as applicable for 
subjects <18 years of age ; s
creening visit [Visit 0]) and will be ≤4 weeks in duration. During the 
screening period, assessments from the SHP621-
301 f inal t reatment 
evaluation visit (Visit 4) will 
be used as the 
Visit 0 screening assessments of the treatment extension study . At the screening 
visit ( Visit 0 ), subjects who are on a PPI [INVESTIGATOR_64647] ; if they  are not taking a PPI, they  must remain off of a PPI [INVESTIGATOR_64667] o f the stud y. 
Eligible subjects will receive investigational product based on treatment assignment in 
SHP621 -301 for up to 4 weeks prior to enrollment in the treatment extension study . This 4-week 
screening period is required to allow for blinded treatment response information (reduction in 
DSQ from baseline and eosinophilic count as determined by  a central reader) collected during 
the SHP621-301 f inal t reatment evaluation visit to be entered into the interactive web-based
response system (IWRS) . 
Only the unblinded data team who is independent from the blinded 
study  team and not involved with the day -to-day conduct of the study will have restricted access 
to blinded treatment response information . Once response information is available, subjects will 
return f or the randomization v
isit (Visit 1 ) to receive investigational product. Subjects who 
continue to meet eligibility  criteria after the screening visit ( Visit 0 ) will enter the 36 -week 
double -blind treatment period.
Subjects who were assigned to OBS treatmen t and who f ully responded in the SHP621- 301 study  
(≤6 eos/ HPF across all available esophageal levels and at least a 30% reduction in DSQ at the 
final 
treatment e valuation visit) will enter a randomized withdrawal p eriod to receive either OBS 
2 mg twice daily or placebo at a 1:1 ratio. These subjects will also be stratified by  [CONTACT_654] (adults and 
adolescents). 
Subjects who were assigned to OBS treatment and did not respond or partiall y 
responded in the SHP621 -[ADDRESS_70407] DSQ data from the SHP621 -301 (post randomization) 
andthis extension st udy until the database locks occurs for this extension study . 
At Week 12, all subjects will undergo an upper esophagogastroduodenoscopy  (EGD) with 
biopsy  to evaluate eosinophil counts. Upon receipt of blinded EGD and DSQ data, subjects on 
placebo in the randomized withdrawal period who have relapsed will have their treatment 
assignment changed to OBS 2 mg twice dail yat the next scheduled visit . The criteria for relapse 
is having an eosinophilic count of ≥15 eos/ HPF from at least 2of [ADDRESS_70408] will remain assigned to placebo. The upper EGD with esophageal 
biopsies will be repeated at the Week 36 visit (Visit 8) or at earl y termination (ET) , to evaluate 
eosinophil counts. If an unscheduled EGD is performed between Week [ADDRESS_70409] to 
query  for SAEs, AEs, and concomitant treatments.
The upper limit of 55 years, inclusive, was selected for this study  population based on the low 
prevalence of EoE in older patients ( Dellon et al. 2014a ) and the fact that asEoE persists, it 
becomes more fibrostenotic in older patients and would not be amenable to a nti-inflammatory  
treatment alone (Dellon et al. 2014b). A natural history  study  demonstrated that for every  decade 
of life, the odds of developi[INVESTIGATOR_64649] 
(Dellon etal. 2014b ). By [CONTACT_654] 55, fibrostenotic EoE occurs in approximately  80% of patients. 
Fibrostenotic disease is treated with dilatation and is not amenable to anti -inflammatory  
treatment alone. Therefore, budes onide is not expected to be an effective treatment for the 
majority  of patients above age 55.
The design of this study  combines randomized withdrawal and long -term extension elements in a 
manner that selects appropriate patients for placebo withdrawal and maintains double -blinding of 
subjects in all treatment groups. Onl y subjects who are full responders to OBS 2 mg twice dail y
in the SHP621 -301 induction study (≤6 eos/ HPF across all available esophageal levels and at 
least a 30% reduction in DSQ at the f inal treatment evaluation visit of SHP621- 301), will be 
eligible for randomized withdrawal. The randomized withdrawal period i s required to assess 
maintenance of efficacy  in these subjects. The continuation of OBS [ADDRESS_70410] of reinitiating OBS treatment in these subjects. For subjects who relapse on placebo during 
the randomized withd rawal and who reinitiate treatment with OBS 2 mg twice dail y (intermittent 
therap y), separate descriptive anal yses for histological data and DSQ endpoints will be 
conducted at each assessment visit, as described in Section 9.8.2.
For all subjects, anesoph ageal 
stricture requiring dilation would be considered a treatment failure and result in withdrawal of 
the subject from the study . Subject withdrawal criteria are provide din Section 4.5.1.
3.[ADDRESS_70411]’s maximum dur ation of participation is expected to be approximately  [ADDRESS_70412] who completes all procedures and assessments up to and including Visit 
8(Week 36) , inclusive of the f inal treatment evaluation EGD .All subjects will have a f ollow -up 
phone call [ADDRESS_70413] participate in the informed consent process and provide written informed 
consent/assent before any procedures specified in the protocol are performed.

criteria (including test results) :
1. Subject completed SHP621-[ADDRESS_70415] is able to provide written informed consent (subject, parent or legal guardian and, as

 of OBS 
(2mg) twice dail yfor a total daily  dose of 4 mg.
At Week 12, all subjects will undergo an upper esophagogastroduodenoscopy  (EGD) with 
biopsy to evaluate eosinophil counts. Upon receipt of blinded EGD and DSQ data, subjects on 
placebo in the randomized withdrawal period who have relapsed will have their treatment 
assignment changed to OBS 2 mg twice dail y. The criteria for relapse is having an eosinophil 
count of ≥15 eos/ HPF from at least [ADDRESS_70447] 4 day s of d ysphagia in the2-week period prior to the scheduled visit , 
as determined b y the DSQ. Considering the potenti al for missing diary
 entries, the determination 
of relapse based on day s of dy sphagia reported on the DSQ will occur as follows:
If at least [ADDRESS_70448] would meet the cri terion for dy sphagia sy mptom relapse . 
If less than [ADDRESS_70449] would not meet the criterion for dy sphagia sy mptom relapse . 
If less than [ADDRESS_70450] would be designated as meeting the criterion 
for d ysphagia s ymptom relapse due to missing diary  data as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS].

the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1-1 ) and must be referred to in conjunction with the 
instructions provided in this section. 
Prior to performing an y study-related procedures (including those related to screening), the 
investigator or his/her designee must obtain written informed consent from the subjec t (as per 
local requirements). There must be documentation of consent (as per local requirements) 
indicating that the subject is aware of the investigational nature of the study and the required 
procedures and restrictions, prior to performing any  study -related procedures.
7.1.1 Screening Period (Week s -4to 0)
The screening period starts when subjects sign informed consent. The screening period will 
comprise up to 4weeks, during which all procedures listed for the screening visit (Visit 0 ) in 
Table 1-[ADDRESS_70463]’s inclusion into the study . A subject should not be instructed to discontinue use 
of an y medication or treatment to participate in this study until infor med consent has been 
obtained. Subjects should not stop perm itted medications or treatments that are effective and well 
tolerated to participate in this study (Section 5.2.1 ).
Assessments from the SHP621
-301 final treatment evaluation visit (Visit 4) will be used as the 
screening assessments ( Visit 0 ) of this treat ment extension study . Screening assessments may  
take place across several day s to allow an appropriate time frame in which to complete all 
procedures and confirm study  eligibility . 
At the SHP621-[ADDRESS_70464] (based on treatment assignment in 
SHP621 -301) that will last for up to 4 weeks prior to enrolling into t his treatment extension 
study . The 4-week screening period is required to allow for blinded treatment response 
infor mation (reduction in DSQ from baseline and eosinophilic count as determined by  a central 
reader) collected during the SHP621 -301 final treatment evaluation visit to be entered into the 
IWRS .
After the s creening period, subjects who meet eligibility  criteri a at the end of the screening visit
(Visit 0 ) will enter the 36-week double -blind treatment period . This period should not commence 
until all screening assessments required to confirm initial eligibility  have been completed. If the 
subject does not meet elig ibility  criteria following completion of screening assessments, the 
investigator or designee will document the subject as a screen failure in the I W
RS.
A screen failure is a subject who has given informed consent and failed to meet the inclusion 
criteria and/or met at least [ADDRESS_70465] been designated a s a screen

7.2.1 Efficacy
[IP_ADDRESS] Esophagogastroduodenoscopy with Esophageal Biopsy and 
Histopathologic Evaluation
The EGD with endoscopy  score and biops y will be performed during the study  as outlined in 
Table 1-1. 
The screening EGD with biopsies will be performed by a physician at the investigative site at the 
final treatment evaluation visit in the SH P621 -301study . Biops y specimens must be taken and 
provided to the central pathology  lab b y at least 2 weeks prior to the planned Visit 1 to allow 
sufficient time for processing and central review and determination of eligibility .Subjects, site 
staff, and study  team members will remain blinded to eosinophil counts and histopathologic 
findings b y the central re ader throughout the duration of the study .
At the Week 12 visit (Visit 4), and Week 36 visit (Visit 8) or at early  termination (ET), an EGD 
with esophageal biopsies is required for all subjects. If at an y time, the subject reports increased 
or worsening d ysphagia sy mptoms to the investigator, the investigator may  chooseto perform an 
unscheduled EGD. If an unscheduled EGD is performed prior to Week 12, an EGD does not 
have to be repeated at Week 12. If an unscheduled EGD is performed between Week 12 and 
Week 36, the Week 36 EGD should still be performed
. Multiple specimens (at least 2 biopsies 
from each of 3 levels, 6 specimens total ) will be obtained f rom the proximal (3 cm below the 
cricophary ngeus muscle), 
midesophagus (midpoint between the cricopharyngeus muscle and the 
gastroesophageal junction), and distal (3 cm above the gastroesophageal junction) .Biops y tissue 
will be placed in 3 separate vials (1 vial for each of the levels) and sent to the central pathology  
laboratory  for processing of tissue into slides . 
Eosinophil counts and, histopathologic features 
will be evaluated by  [CONTACT_64755]. Eight h istopathologic epi[INVESTIGATOR_64670] (basal lay er hy perplasia, eosinophil density , eosinophil microabscesses, eosinophil 
surface lay ering , dilated intercellular spaces, surface epi[INVESTIGATOR_64633], dy skeratotic epi[INVESTIGATOR_15129], lamina propria fibrosis ) will be scored ona 4-p
ointscale (0=normal, 3=worst) for both the 
severit y of the abnormality  (ie,grade) and the amount of tissue affected b y the abnormality (ie, 
stage) . 
Endoscopic findings with separate evaluations of the proximal and distal esophagus will be 
recorded with respect to [ADDRESS_70480] : 1) exudates or plaques (grade 0 –
2); 2) 
fixed esophageal rings (grade 0 –3); 3) edema (grade 0–2
); 4) furrows (grade 0–2); and 5) 
strictures (grade 0 –

duodenum as follows: gastric body  (greater curvature): 2 specimens, gastric antrum: 
2 specimens, and duodenum (thir d part or distal): 2 specimens. Biopsies from the stomach should 
be submitted in 1vial; biopsies from the duodenum should be submitted in a separate vial to the 
central pathology  laboratory  for processing of tissue into slides. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Dysphagia Symptom Questionnaire
Subjects’ dy sphagia s ymptoms will be evaluated using a DSQ ePRO device ( Appendix 3 ). 
The questionnaire will be completed b y subjects daily  during the screening period and during the 
36-week treatment period . Each evening before bedtime, subjects will be aske d to indicate if they  
experienced d ysphagia sy mptoms ( eg, food passing slowl y or food sticking) during that day.
Subjects must fill out the DSQ at least 5or more daysduring a given week in order to be 
compliant. Visit to visit compliance of DSQ completion will also be assessed by  [CONTACT_8786]. 
Protocol deviations will be documented for subjects who fail to complete the DSQ for [ADDRESS_70482] 4 day s of d ysphagia as determined by [CONTACT_3433] e 
DSQ in the 2- week period prior to the scheduled visit in addition to meeting the eosinophil 
histology  criterion ( ≥15 eos/ HPF from at least 2of 3levels of the esophagus). Considering the 
potential for missing diary entries, the determination of relapse based on days o f dysphagia 
reported on the DSQ will occur as follows:
If at least [ADDRESS_70483] would meet the criterion for dysphagia sy mptom relapse . 
If less than [ADDRESS_70484] would not meet the criterion for dy sphagia sy mptom relapse . 
If less than [ADDRESS_70485] would be designated as meeting the criterion for d ysphagia 
symptom relapse due to missing diary  
data.
Calculations will be perfo rmed on daily  ePRO entries during a 2-week interval prior to each 
study  visit during the treatment perio d. The DSQ score for the coprimary  endpoint and secondary  
endpoints will be calculated by  [CONTACT_64709] 2 and 3 only .

related .”Otherwise, if there is an y valid reason, even if undetermined or untested, for suspecting 
a possible cause -and-effect relationship be tween the investigational product and the occurrence 
of the AE, then the AE should be considered “related” based on the definitions in Table 8-1. The 
causality  assessment must be documented in the source document.

8.1.4 Symptoms of the Disease u nder Study
Symptoms of the disease under s tudy should not be classed as AEs as long as they  are within the 
normal day -to-day fluctuation or expected progression of the disease and are part of the efficacy  
data to be collected in the study; however, significant worsening of the s ymptoms should be 
recorded as an AE.
8.1.[ADDRESS_70496] to the start of study  treatment, 
further investigations should be performed until the values return to within the reference range or 
until a plausible explanation ( eg, concomitant disease) is found for the abnormal values.
The investigator should decide, based on the above criteria and the clinical condition of a 
subject, whether a change in a clinical laboratory or vital sign param eter is clinically  significant 
and therefore represents an AE.
8.1.[ADDRESS_70497] be reported within 24 hours to the 
Shire Global Pharmacovigilance and Risk Management Department using the Shire 
Investigational and Marketed Products Pregnancy  Report Form. A copy  of the Shire 
Investigational and Marketed Products Pregnanc y Report Form (and an y applicable follow -up 
reports) must also be sent to the CRO/Shire medical monitor using the details specified in the 
emergency  contact [CONTACT_1739]. The pregnant female study  participant 
must be withdrawn from t he study .
Every  effort should be made to gather information regarding the pregnancy  outcome and 
condition of the i nfant. I t is the responsibility  of the investigator to obtain this information within 
30 calendar day s after the initial notification and appr oximately  30 calendar day s postpartum.
Pregnancy  complications such as spontaneous abortion/miscarriage or congenital abnormality  
are considered SAEs and must be reported using the Shire Clinical Study  Adverse Event Form
for SAEs and Non -serious AEs as Re quired b y Protocol . Note: An elective abortion is not 
considered an SAE.

8.1.7 Abuse, Misuse, Overdose, and Medication Error
Abuse, misuse, overdose, or medication error (as defined below) must be reported to the sponsor 
according to the SAE reporting procedure whether or not they  result in an AE/SAE as described 
in Section 8.2. Note: T he 24 -hour reporting requirement for SAEs does not apply  to reports of 
abuse, misuse, overdose, or medication errors unless these result in an SAE. 
The categories below are not mutually  exclusive; the event can meet more than 1 category .
Abuse –Persistent or sporadic intentional intake of investigational product when used for a 
nonmedical purpose ( eg,to alter one’s state of consciousness or get high) in a manner that 
may be detrimental to the individual and/or society
Misuse –Intentional use of investig ational product other than as directed or indicated at any  
dose (Note: this includes a situation where the investigational product is not used as directed 
at the dose prescribed b y the protocol)
Overdose –Intentional or unintentional intake of a dose of a n investigational product 
exceeding a prespecified total daily  dose of [ADDRESS_70499].
Medication Error –An error made in prescribing, dispensing, administration, and/or use of 
an investigational product. For studies, medication errors are reportable to the sponsor only  
as defined below.
Cases of subjects missing doses of the investigational product are not considered reportable as 
medication errors.
Medication errors should be collected/reported for all products under investigation.
The administratio n and/or use of the unassigned treatment is/are alway s reportable as a 
medication error.
The administration and/or use of an expi[INVESTIGATOR_10151] a 
reportable medication error.
All investigational product provided to pedi atric subjects should be supervised by  [CONTACT_31588] s/legall yauthorized representative/caregiver.
8.[ADDRESS_70500] awareness of the event. Note: The 24-hour reporting requirement for SAEs does 
not apply  to reports of abuse, misuse, overdose, or medication errors (Section 8.1.7) unless they  
result in an SAE.
The investigator must complete, sign , and date the Shire Clinical Study  Adverse Event Form for 
SAEs and Non- serious AEs as Required b y Protocol and verify  the accuracy  of the information 
recorded on the form with the corresponding source documents (Note: Source documents are not 
to be sent u nless requested) and fax or e -mail the form to the Shire Global Pharmacovigilance 
and Risk Management Department. A cop y of the Shire Clinical Study  Adverse Event Form for 
SAEs and Non- serious AEs as Required b y Protocol (and an y applicable follow -up repor ts) must
also be sent to the CRO medical monitor using the details specified in the emergency  contact 
[CONTACT_1739].
8.2.3 Serious Adverse Event Definition
A Serious A dverse Event (SAE) is any  untoward medical occurrence (whether considered to be 
related to investigational product or not) that at any dose:
Results in death
Is life -threatening. Note: The term “ life-threatening ” in the definition of “serious” refers to an 
event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event ; it does not refer to an 
event which h ypothetically might have caused death if it was more severe.
Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3850]. Note: 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], which are the result of elective or previousl y sched uled surgery  for 
pre-
existing conditions, which have not worsened after initiation of treatment, sh ould not be 
classified as SAEs. For example, an admission for a previousl y scheduled ventral hernia 
repair would not be classified as an SAE; however, compli cation(s) resulting from a 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10153] y scheduled surgery  that meet(s) serious criteria 
must be reported as SAE(s).
Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity .
Is a congenital abnormality /birth defect .
Is an important medical event. Note: I mportant medical events that may  not result in death, 
be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10154], based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they  may  jeopardize the subject and may  require m edical or
surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outco mes listed in this definition. Examples of such 
medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency  
room or at home; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or the development of drug dependency  or drug abuse.

8.2.4 Serious Adverse Event Collection Time Frame
All SAEs (regardless of relationship to study ) are collected from the time the subject signs the 
informed consent until the defined follow- up period stated in Section 7.1.[ADDRESS_70501] awareness of the event. 
In addition, any  SAE(s) considered “related” to the investigational product and discovered by  [CONTACT_10194] y interval after the study has completed must be reported to the Shire Global 
Pharmacovigilance and Risk Management Department within [ADDRESS_70502]’s death ( ie,the SAE was noted as the primary  cause of death) 
must have “fatal” checked as an outcome with the date of death r ecorded as the resolution date.
For all other events ongoing at the time of death that did not contribute to the subject’s death, the 
outcome should be considered as not resolved, without a resolution date recorded.
For an y SAE that results in the subject’s death or any ongoing events at the time of death, unless 
another investigational product action was previously  taken (eg, drug interrupted, reduced, 
withdrawn), the action taken with the investigati onal product should be recorded as “dose not 
changed” or “not applicable” (if the subject never received investigational product). The 
investigational product action of “withdrawn” should not be selected solel y as a result of the 
subject’s death. 
8.2.[ADDRESS_70503], Ethics Committee, and Site 
Reporting
Thesponsor and the clinical CRO are responsible for notify ing the relevant regulatory  
authorities/US central Institutional Review Boards ( IRBs)of related, unexpected SAEs.
In ad dition ,the sponsor and the clinical CRO areresponsible for notify ing active sites of all 
related, unexpected SAEs occurring during all interventional studies across the SHP621
program . 
The investigator is responsible for notify ing the local IRB, local ethics committee ( EC), or the 
relevant local regulatory  authority  of all SAEs that occur at his or her site as required.

9. DATA MANAGEMENT AND STATISTICAL METHODS
9.1 Data Collection
The investigators’ authorized site personnel must enter the information requir edby [CONTACT_64760]. A study  monitor will visit each site in accordance with the monitoring plan and 
review the CRF data against the source data for completeness and accuracy .Discrepancies 
between source data and data entered on the CRF will be ad dress ed by [CONTACT_1746].
When a data discrepancy warrants correction, the correction will be mad e by [CONTACT_59752]. Data collection procedures will be discussed with the site at the site initiation visit 
and/or at the investigator’s meeting. Once a subject is randomized, it is expected that site 
personnel will complete the CRF entry  within approximately  [ADDRESS_70504]’s 
visit.
9.2 Clinical Data Management
Data are to be entered into a clinical database as specified in the CRO’s data management plan.
Quality  control and data validation procedures are applied to ensure the validity  and accuracy  of 
the clinical database.
Data are to be reviewed and checked for omissions, errors, and values requiring further 
clarification usin g compu terized and manual procedures. Data queries requiring clarification are 
to be communicated to the site for r esolution. Only authorized personnel will make corrections to 
the clinical database, and all corrections are documented in an auditable manne r.
9.3 Data Handling Considerations
Data that may  potentiall y unblind the treatment assignment ( ie,investigational product serum 
concentrations, treatment allocation, and investigational product preparation/accountability  data) 
will be handled with special ca re during the da ta cleaning and review process. These data will be 
handled in such a way  that, prior to unblinding, any  data that may  unblind study  team personnel 
will be presented as blinded information or otherw ise will not be made available. If applicable, 
unblinded data may  be made available to quality  assurance representatives for the purposes of 
conducting independent drug audits. 
9.4 Statistical Analysis Process
The study  will be anal yzed by  [CONTACT_10196]. All statistical anal yses will be per formed 
using SAS®(SAS Institute, Cary , NC, [LOCATION_003]) version 9.3or higher.
The statistical analysis plan ( SAP)will provide the statistical methods and definitions for the 
analysis of the efficacy  and safet y data, as well as describe the approaches to be tak en for 
summarizing other study  information such as subject disposition, demographics and baseline 
characteristics, investigational product exposure, and prior and concomitant medications. The 
SAP will also include a description of how missing, unused and s purious data will be addressed.

SHP621 -302 19 Dec 2016
The SAP will be finalized prior to final database lock and performing analy sis (ie, unblinding )to 
preserve the integrit y of the statistical a nalysis and study  conclusions. 
9.5 Planned Interim Analysis, Adaptive Design, and Dat a Monitoring Committee
No interim anal ysis is planned.
9.6 Sample Size Calculation and Power Considerations
Approximately  200 subjects (88%) who are randomized in the SHP621 -301 study  are estimated 
to complete the SHP621- 301 study  and enroll in this treatment extension study  based on 
enrollment observed in the Phase 2 study  (MPI 101 -06).
The primary  efficacy  measure of the stud y will be the proportion of subjects who relapse during
the double -blind randomized withdrawal period, defined as having an eosinophil c ount of 
≥15eos/HPF from at least 2of 3levels of the esophagus (as determined b y a central reader) and 
at least 4 day s of d ysphagia in the 2 -week period prior to the scheduled visit (as determined b y 
the DSQ ). To be considered as a subject with relapse , both criteria must be met. To determine 
whether a subject meets the criterion for d ysphagia, refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS] .
Based on observation in the Phase 2 study  (MPI 101 -06), approximately  26% of subjects, or 
approximately  [ADDRESS_70505] a 
50 percentage point difference between relapse proportions of 20% and 70% in the OBS and 
placebo groups, respectivel y, at more than 
80% power and a significance level of 0.05 (2- sided) 
using the Fisher’s Exact test with equal allocation to treatment groups, it is necessary  to assess 
the primary  efficacy  measure for approximately  38subjects (19 subjects in each of the O BS and 
placebo groups) . 
9.[ADDRESS_70506].
The intent -to-treat (ITT) setwill include all randomized subjects. Subjects will be analy zed 
according to their assigned treatment, regardless of the treatment actuall y received.
The full analysis set (FAS) will include all randomized subjects who received at least 
[ADDRESS_70507] baseline efficacy  assessment (biopsy  and/or DSQ score) .
The per-protocol 
(PP) set will include all subjects in the FAS excluding subjects with major 
protocol deviat ions. The PP set will be identified prior to unblinding the treatment assignments 
by a team consisting of, at a minimum, a phy sician and a statistician from Shire.

Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page [ADDRESS_70508] is relapse during the double- blind randomized 
withdrawal period. Relapse , a binary  response (either with a relapse or not), is def ined as having 
an eosinophil count of ≥15eos/HPF from at least [ADDRESS_70509] 4 day s of dy sphagia in the 2 -week period prior to the 
scheduled visit, as determined by  [CONTACT_941] D SQ(refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS] for additional details).
The primary  efficacy endpoint will be analy zed as
the proportion of subjects with relapse during
the double- blind randomized withdrawal period for the FAS, using a Fisher’s Exact test 
comparing OBS [ADDRESS_70510] will be 
2-sided, and conducted at the significance level of 0.05. The proportion of subjects with relapse 
for each treatment group and the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) will be estimated. 
In addition, the difference in the proportion of subjects with relapse between the 2treatment 
groups and its 95% CI
 will be estimated.
Subjects who withdraw without providing efficacy data at the ET visit will be classified as being
relapse rsin the prima ry efficacy  anal ysis. The null hy pothesis states that there is no difference in 
relapse proportions between OBS [ADDRESS_70511] ying the Fisher’s Exact test to the observed data at each 
double -blind visit.
The following sensitivity and supportive anal yses will be performed for the primary  endpoint to 
evaluate the robustness of the re sults from the primary  anal ysis methods.
Similar a nalyses used for the ITT population will be repeated using the FAS and the PP datasets. 
Sensitivity  analyses will be performed using the ITT population by [CONTACT_64761]- relapsers. Sensitivity  analy ses 
will be performed using the ITT population b y classifying subjects who met the histology  relapse 
criterion and met the dysphagia sy mptom relapse criterion due to missing diary  data as non-
relapsers. In addition, the subjects who were prematurel y withdrawn from the study without the 
primary  efficacy  endpoint will be imputed randomly  according to the distribution of re lapser s 
with available data ; and the similar statistical test will be per formed using the imputed data .  
9.8.2 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints
[IP_ADDRESS] Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoint
The key  secondary  efficacy  endpoint is the long
-term treatment response , a binary  response over 
an extended period of 36 weeks in adolescent and adult subjects who were randomized to OBS 
treatment but did not respond after 12 weeks inthe SHP621 -301 induction 
study (subject did not 
have peak count of ≤6 eos/HPF across all available esophageal levels at the final treatment visit 
and/or ≥30% reduction in DSQ score from baseline ) and met the following criteria:

For subjects who relapse on placebo during the randomized withdrawal and who reinitiate 
treatment with OBS 2 mg twice dail y (intermittent therap y), separate descriptive analyses for 
histological data and DSQ endpoints will be conducted at each assessment visit. Changes will be 
summarized over time from baseline of the SHP621- 301 study  and from the time of relapse. The 
same criteria for response will be applied to these subjects ( ≤6 eos/ HPF across all available 
esophageal levels and at l east a 30% reduction in DSQ from SHP621 -301 baseline score).

10.3 Ethical Considerations
10.3.1 Informed Consent
It is the responsibility  of the investigator to obtain written informed consent (or assent as 
applicable for subjects <18 yearsof age ) from all study  subjects prior to any  study -related 
procedures includ ing screening assessments. All consent documentation must be in accordance 
with applicable regulations and GCP. Each subject or the subject’s legall y authorized 
representative, as applicable, is requested to sign and date the subject ’sinformed cons ent form or 
a certified translation , if applicable, after the subject has received and read (or been read) the 
written subject information and received an explanation of what the study  involves, including but 
not limited to the objectives, potential benefi ts and risk, inconveniences, and the subject’ s rights 
and responsibilities. A copy  of the informed consent documentation ( ie,a complete set of subject 
information sheets and fully  executed signature [CONTACT_1787]) must be given to the subject or the 
subject’s leg ally authorized representative, as applicable. This document may  require transl ation 
into the local language. Signed consent forms must remain in each subject’s study  file and must 
be available for verification at an y time.
Within the source documents, sit e personnel should document instruction of and understanding 
by [CONTACT_7071] s/legall yauthorized representative/caregiver of the safe, responsible storage and 
administration of investigational product to the study  subject.
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_1682] a copy  of the consent form consent (or 
assent as applicable for subjects <18 years of age )that was reviewed b y the I RB/EC and received 
their favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]/approval. A cop y of the IRB ’s/EC’s written favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]/approval 
of these documents must be provided to the sponsor, prior to the start of the study  unless it is 
agreed to and documented (abiding b y regulatory  guidelines and national provisions) prior to 
study  start that another party  (ie, sponsor or coordinating principal inve stigator) is responsible for 
this action. Additionally , if the I RB/EC requires modification of the sample subject information 
and consent document provided by  [CONTACT_456], the documentation supporting this requirement 
must be provided to the sponsor.
10.3.[ADDRESS_70516] or Ethics Committee
For sites outside the EU, it is the responsibility  of the investigator to submit this protocol, the 
informed consent document (approved b y the sponsor or their designee), relevant supporting 
information ,and all ty pes of subject recruitment information to the I RB/EC for review, and all 
must be approved prior to site initiation .

10.[ADDRESS_70518] to the CRO/sponsor .
The confidentialit y of records that may be able to identify subjects will be protected in 
accordance with applicable laws, regulations, and guidelines.
After subjects have consented to take part in the study , the s ponsor and/or its representatives 
reviews their medical records and data collected during the stud y.These records and data may , in 
addition, be reviewed b y others including the following: independent auditors who validate the 
data on behalf of the sponsor; third parties with whom the sponsor may develop, register, or 
market SHP621 ; national or local regulatory  authorities; and the I RBs/ECs which gave appr oval 
for the stud y to proceed. The sponsor and/or its representatives accessing the records and data 
will take all reasonable precautions in accordance with applicable laws, regulations, and 
guidelines to maintain the confidentialit y of subjects’ identities.
Subjects are assigned a unique identify ing number; however, their initials and date of birth may  
also be collected and used to assist the sponsor to verify  the accuracy  of the data ( eg,to confirm 
that laboratory  results have been assigned to the correct subject).
The results of studies –containing subjects’ unique identify ing number, relevant medical 
records, and possibly  initials and dat es of birth – will be recorded. They  may  be transferred to 
and used in other countries which may  not afford the same level of protection that applies within 
the countries where this study  is conducted. The purpose sof any such transfer would include 
support ingregulatory  submissions, conduct ingnew data analy ses to publish or present the study  
results, or answer ingquestions asked by  [CONTACT_64730].
10.5 Study Results/Publication Policy
Shire will endeavor to publish the results of all qualify ing, applicable, and covered studies 
according to external guidelines in a timely  manner regardless of whether the outcomes are

A 4-week screening period is required to allow  for blinded treatme nt 
response information (reduction in DSQ from baseline and eosinophilic count 
as determined by a central reader) collected during the SHP621 -301 final 
treatment evaluation visit to be entered into the interactive web -based 
response system (IWRS) by.Only the unblinded data team who is 
independent from the blinded study team and not involved with the day -to-
day conduct of the study will have restricted access to blinded treatm ent 
response inform ation . 
Rationale: This text has been clarified to emphasize t hat access to blinded 
treatment response information will be restricted to the unblinded data team. 
Blinded treatment response data w ill not be accessed by [CONTACT_3476]; 
therefore, the double -blind will be maintained.Synopsis: Investigational

order to determine the criterion for DSQ relapse. Considering the potential 
for missing diary entries, the determ ination of relapse based on days of 
dysphagia reported on the DSQ will occur as follows:
If at least [ADDRESS_70522] would m eet the 
criterion for dysphagia symptom relapse. If fewer
If less than [ADDRESS_70523] would 
not m eet criterion for dysphagia sym ptom relapse . 
If less than [ADDRESS_70524] meets the criteria 
for dysphagia sym ptom relapse over 14 consecutive days; 
however, the [ADDRESS_70525] 8 
diary entrie s are recorded in the 14 -day period and will not be 
shifted by [CONTACT_726] 2 weeks in total (ie, no more than 2 -week 
period plus additional 2 -week additional expansion). 
The criteria for relapse align with the related inclusion criteria for 
participation in the SHP621 -301 study. If both histology and dysphagia 
symptom relapse criteria are m et, then the treatment assignment change 
will be performed in a blinded manner in IWRS at the subsequent study 
visit by [CONTACT_64736].

Relapse proportions at each adjacent double -blind visit interval will also be 
assessed by [CONTACT_64738]’s Exact chi-square test to the observed data 
at each double -blind visit.
Rationale: The primary efficacy analysis method has been changed from the 
Chi-square test to Fisher’s exact test. Considering the expected number of 
subjects in the randomized withdraw al portion of the study, and the very

Re: SHP621 -302 Protocol Amendment 2 - Administrative Change   
 
 
This memorandum serves  to provide administrative changes made to SHP621 -301 Protocol Amendment 
2 (dated 19 Dec 2016 ) that do not impact the overall study design, safety, or study conduct and in 
accordance with [COMPANY_005] procedures .  
 
Rationale for changes:  
• To update t echnical asp ects of the statistical testing method for the primary endpoint  
• To describe the fixed sequence procedure for hierarchy testing of certain  secondary endpoints  
• To provide clarification on the intent of the key secondary endpoint   
• To include  additional exploratory endpoints  
 
Protocol Section  Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_70540] a  50 percentage 
point difference between relapse 
proportions of 20% and 70% in the OBS 
and placebo groups, respectively, at more 
than 80% power and a significance level 
of 0.05 (2 -sided)  using the Fisher ’s Exact 
test with equal allocation to treatment 
groups, it is necessary to assess  the 
primary efficacy measure for 
approximately 38  subjects (19 subjects in 
each of the OBS and  placebo groups).  For this study, to detect a  50 
percentage point difference between 
relapse proportions of 20% and 70% 
in the OBS and  placebo groups, 
respectively, at more than 80% 
power and a significance level of 
0.05 (2 -sided)  0.025 (1 -sided)  using 
the Fisher ’s Exact test with equal 
allocation to treatment groups, it is 
necessary to assess  the primary 
efficacy measure for approximately 
38 subjects (19 subjects in each of 
the OBS and  placebo groups).  
Hierarchical testing with fixed 
sequence procedure will be used to 
control the Type I error for the 
multiple endpoints tested at one -
sided α = 0.025. For a test to be 
considered  statistically significant 
within the testing hierarchy, it must 
be statistically significant at the one -
sided 0.[ADDRESS_70541] be statistically significant at the 
one-sided 0.025 level, The fixed 
sequen ce of testing hierarchy is as 
follows:  
1. Relapse during the double -
blind randomized withdrawal 
period.  
2. Histologic response [peak 
eosinophil count of ≤6/high-
powered field (HPF) across 
all available esophageal 
levels] at Visit 8 (Week 36)

9.8.1 Primary 
Efficacy Endpoint  The primary efficacy endpoint will be 
analyzed as the proportion of subjects 
with relapse during  the double -blind 
randomized withdrawal period for the 
FAS, using a Fisher ’s Exa ct test  
comparing OBS [ADDRESS_70542] will be  2-sided, and conducted at 
the significance level of 0.05.  The primary efficacy endpoint will be 
analyzed as the proportion of 
subjects with relapse during  the 
double -blind randomized withdrawal 
period for the FAS, using a Fisher ’s 
Exact test  comparing OBS [ADDRESS_70543] will 
be 2-sided  1-sided , and conducted at 
the significance level of 0.05 0.025. 
9.8.1 Primary 
Efficacy Endpoint 
(sensitivity 
analyses)  In addition, the subjects who were 
prematurely withdrawn from the study 
without the  primary efficacy endpoint will 
be imputed randomly according to the 
distribution of relapsers  with available 
data; and the similar statistical test will be 
performed using the imputed data.  In addition, the subjects who were 
prematurely withdrawn from the 
study without the primary efficacy 
endpoint will be imputed randomly 
according to the distribution of 
relapsers with available data; and the 
similar statistical test will be 
performed using the imputed data.  
Analysis will be repeated based on 
FAS using dif ferent missing data 
handling methods to assess the 
impact of missing data on relapse.

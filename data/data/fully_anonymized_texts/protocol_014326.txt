PRINCIPAL/OVERALL INVESTIGATOR Sofia Vallila Rohter  PROTOCOL TITLE Determining the implicit and rule-based learning ability of individuals with aphasia to better align learning ability and intervention  FUNDING NIH NIDCD R21 DC019203-01    VERSION DATE Version 7: 8/30/[ADDRESS_492886]-stroke aphasia (acquired language impairment). We aim to determine a behavioral phenotype of learning for people with aphasia (PWA), examining how cognitive-linguistic variables and stroke characteristics (lesion size and location) relate to learning.   To this end, the aims are as follows:  Aim 1. Determine the presence of selective deficits in observational (implicit) and rule-based learning in individuals with aphasia. Participants in our study will be stratified in to one of four learning profiles: learning under (a) both conditions, (b) rule-based conditions only, (c) observational conditions only, and (d) no condition. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_392666] a, c and d (20% of pi[INVESTIGATOR_392667]) with 40% showing learning under rule-based conditions only, supporting the hypothesis that differences in learning profile arise among PWA.   Aim 2. Determine the predictors of observational and rule-based learning, incorporating subject-specific measures of structural brain damage, aphasia severity, attention, verbal working memory and executive function.  We will use regression models to determine predictors of observational learning and rule-based learning, evaluating findings against theoretical frameworks. We predict that preservation of the striatum and selective attention will contribute to observational learning ability. Preservation of the prefrontal cortex, verbal working memory and executive function are expected to contribute to rule-based learning ability.   BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE Provide a brief paragraph summarizing prior experience important for understanding the proposed study and procedures.  Aphasia is an impairment in the expression or comprehension of language that results from stroke, traumatic brain injury or progressive neurological disease.  Research has shown that speech-language therapy, the treatment for aphasia, can significantly improve people’s ability to communicate.  However, A major challenge facing the field of aphasia rehabilitation is the variable response to intervention; while some patients respond to therapy, others show limited progress. 
Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form   Filename: [CONTACT_392705]:  October 15, [ADDRESS_492887] exclusively based on language abilities with little to no attention to underlying learning abilities. Our overarching hypothesis is that poor alignment of learning ability and language therapy limits progress and contributes to the variability in outcomes. During aphasia rehabilitation, patients are guided to relearn language, reaccess language or regain functional use of language via therapi[INVESTIGATOR_392668], tasks, cues and feedback (see Horton, 2006).  Consequently, the process of therapy implicitly engages many mechanisms of learning that need to be systematically considered in aphasia.  Evidence is emerging to suggest that nonlinguistic learning is impaired in individuals with aphasia (Schuchard & Thompson, 2014; Vallila-Rohter & Kiran, 2013a; Vallila-Rohter & Kiran, 2013b); and furthermore, that PWA develop strategies less consistently and less effectively than non brain-damaged controls (Vallila-Rohter & Kiran, 2015).  We suggest that the contribution of underlying cognitive systems is essential to relearning in aphasia and that understanding the behaviors associated with learning are critical for our understanding of the mechanisms of therapy and ways to better tailor treatment to individuals.   In aphasia, little is understood about how task and treatment manipulations impact patient behaviors and progress with therapy.  We propose to thoroughly examine the behaviors of learning and the cognitive-linguistic and lesion characteristics that relate to learning, to characterize a phenotype of learning for individuals with aphasia, setting the foundations for intervention studies aimed at individually tailoring treatment and improving the predictability of outcomes.    RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Briefly describe study design and anticipated enrollment, i.e., number of subjects to be enrolled by [CONTACT_17839]-wide and by [CONTACT_17840].  Provide a brief summary of the eligibility criteria (for example, age range, gender, medical condition).  Include any local site restrictions, for example, “Enrollment at Partners will be limited to adults although the sponsor’s protocol is open to both children and adults.”Study Design  In this cross-sectional study, 75 participants will complete language and cognitive assessments and behavioral tests of learning. A subset of participants will also complete a structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan to obtain structural brain images.  
  Sessions 1 & 2 described above, may take 3 sessions. If an additional session is needed, participants may complete this session in person or over Zoom based on preference. Session 3 described above, may be broken into 2 sessions based on participant scheduling preference.  

Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form   Filename: [CONTACT_392705]:  October 15, 2014    3   Participants will be tested over three to five sessions during which they will complete: (a) behavioral testing, (b) structural scanning. We anticipate that behavioral sessions (a) and (b) will take around 6 to 7 hours to complete.   (a) Behavioral testing: Participants will be asked to come to research facilities at the MGH-Institute of Health Professions for behavioral testing. During these sessions, participants will complete standardized cognitive-linguistic assessments and computer-based observational and rule-based tasks, that allow for collection of accuracy, response time and eye gaze data. Most participants are expected to complete behavioral tasks in two to three, two-hour sessions. Some participants may prefer to schedule shorter, and more frequent test sessions and this will be accommodated, and tasks that can be administered over Zoom without affecting data quality (such as those that do not collect response times) can be collected over Zoom if preferred by [CONTACT_4317].    (b) Structural scanning: The majority of participants will also complete a structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan in a 3Tesla scanner at the MGH Athinoula A. Martinos Biomedical Imaging Center to obtain structural images of their brain.   In order to participate in brain scans, participants must:  • be safe to participate as determined by [CONTACT_392687], and  • produce scores of learning on at least one behavior learning task that are above chance. Since brain scan data are being utilized to evaluate and predict learning profile, individuals must show learning on at least one task.   High resolution clinical MRI scans from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_392669]. These scans will be requested, and if judged to be of high quality (e.g. no evidence of motion artifact, whole brain coverage, axial slices with voxels smaller than 3mm) participants may not need to participate in the structural scan at the MGH Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging. Scanning will occur on a separate day or on one of the behavioral testing days.   Eligibility criteria are as follows:  • Be between the ages of 18 and 80 years of age • Have aphasia due to left hemisphere stroke per report and need for speech language therapy • Be in the chronic stages of aphasia, at least [ADDRESS_492888] onset of stroke  • Report pre-morbid native-speaker level fluency in American English • Due to the visual nature of stimuli, have near to normal uncorrected or corrected vision per self-report without the presence of visual field cuts or visual neglect as determined by a score within the range of +/-2.[ADDRESS_492889] (CAT; Hove, 2004) • Pass a hearing screening (thresholds of <40dB at 1, [ADDRESS_492890] one ear)   Exclusion criteria are as follows:  • history of significant mental illness, psychiatric disorder, drug/alcohol abuse or neurological condition such as Parkinson’s Disease, Alzheimer’s Disease, Huntington’s Disease or Cerebral Palsy that could influence cognitive, learning and memory systems.  • Participants who must wear bifocals or gas-permeable contact [CONTACT_392688][INVESTIGATOR_337641] a computer screen are not eligible to participate, as the eye tracking system is not compatible with this type of eyewear.

At least 80% of the research sample should score 93.8 or below on the Western Aphasia Battery (WAB). The WAB is a diagnostic test of aphasia that reports 93.8 is a possible cutoff for the determination of aphasia. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_392670], research studies and the WAB manual itself (Kertesz, 2007) have identified the presence of language impairments in individuals producing scores above this cutoff and include participants in this score range within the aphasia group (e.g. Cruice, Pritchard, & Dipper, 2014; Papanicolaou, Moore, Deutsch, Levin, & Eisenberg, 1988; Ross & Wertz, 2003; Sekine & Rose, 2013; Ulatowska et al., 2001; Ulatowska, Reyes, Santos, & Worle, 2011; Wilson et al., 2012). Differences in language behaviors have been measured between people experiencing left hemisphere stroke with scores above a 93.8 and age/education-matched control participants not having experienced a stroke (e.g. Fromm et al., 2017). It has been reported that this subgroup of individuals warrant treatment and should also be attended to in research. Fromm et al. (2017) examined data from people with aphasia included in the Aphasia Bank database, a large NIH-funded database. In their analyses, they examined data from people with aphasia with scores below a 93.8 and those above a 93.8 compared to control data. In their report, 30% of the individuals with aphasia scored above 93.8. Including 20% of the study sample within this range, therefore is in line with the representation within the AphasiaBank.   Conditions that rule out participation in scans:  • Cardiac pacemaker • Surgical aneurysm clips • Neurostimulator  • Implanted pumps • Metal fragments in body/eyes  • Pregnancy • Weight greater than [ADDRESS_492892] detailed above is determined by [CONTACT_392689]. All consented participants will complete an MRI screening form to screen for exposure to metal/surgical implants. Medical records will be obtained to ensure MRI safety if needed.   Participants will be asked about the following conditions, outlined by [CONTACT_392690]:  • Ear implants (certain cochlear implants are not MR safe) • Metal rods, plates or screws in body or mouth • Injury to eyes involving metal • Previous surgery (if metal left in body) • IUD (most are MR safe, except Copper-7) • Hearing aid (should be removed before scanning) • Dentures (should be removed before scanning) • History of vestibular or inner ear abnormality such as Meniere's Disease • Prosthetic heart valve (most are MR safe, but this must be verified prior to participation) • Hair extensions (most are connected with wire and cause artifacts in data) • Tattoos or permanent eyeliner (if ink contains metallic specks) 
Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form   Filename: [CONTACT_392705]:  October 15, 2014    5  • Tattoos obtained outside of the U.S. (must be approved for scanning by [CONTACT_392691].  • Nicotine patches (those with foil backing must be removed prior to scanning)  Additional screening considerations  • Claustrophobia • Physical discomfort lying flat (back or neck pain etc)  • Movement disorders (i.e. ticks, restless legs etc. that might cause movement artifact)  Data to be collected  1) For learning tasks (see below), data will be collected on accuracy, reaction time, and eye gaze position.  Accuracy and reaction time data will automatically be collected by [CONTACT_167884], E-Prime.  Information about eye gaze will be collected using a near-infrared eye tracker (the Eyelink 1000 Plus) that is physically unobtrusive and conforms to [ZIP_CODE] standards of conformity established by [CONTACT_392692] (IEC) for photobiological safety of lamps and lamp systems.  2) Measures obtained during cognitive-linguistic assessments are standardized and include accuracy of responses, as well as transcription of verbal responses to prompts.  Most data will be collected in real-time as assessments are administered.  Assessments will be video recorded to perform reliability on assessments and additional scoring/transcription of responses as needed. Many of these assessments can be administered in person or remotely without altering data quality.  The following assessments will be administered:  Test administered Purpose Western Aphasia Battery (WAB; Kertesz, 2006) To determine the presence and type of aphasia  Cognitive Linguistic Quick Test (CLQT; Helm-Estabrooks, 2017)  Symbol cancellation subtest: screener for visual neglect.

Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form   Filename: [CONTACT_392705]:  October 15, 2014    6  Tompkins Listening span task (Tompkins et al., 1994) Evaluates auditory-verbal working memory  Brief overview of statistical methods Aim 1. Determine the presence of selective deficits in observational (implicit) and rule-based learning in individuals with aphasia.  Observational learning tasks: Participants will complete two observational learning tasks: Serial Response Time (SRT) Observational learning and Artificial Grammar Learning (AGL) Observational learning.   For the SRT observational learning task (described below), responses are made via eye gaze into a visual area of interest (AOI). Reaction times (RTs) are recorded as the time between target onset and gaze fixation within the target AOI. A trial is considered incorrect if an eye fixation was made that does not correspond to the target AOI. RTs for correct trials are examined. Outlier RTs three standard deviations above the mean RT of each block will be removed.  A score of learning will be computed by [CONTACT_392693] (7th) sequenced block of trials with RTs on the following (8th) pseudorandomized block (Schwarb & Schumacher, 2012). A Cohen’s d effect size (ES) of observational learning will be calculated for each individual participant that compares mean RTs on the final sequenced block (S7) and the pseudorandom block (PS8) using pooled standard deviations. Any participant producing a small ES of 0.2 or above (Cohen, 1988) will be classified as a learner in the observational learning condition.   For the AGL Observational learning task (described below), data are collected on the accuracy of match, non-match responses during training computed as a percent correct. Data are also collected as a percent correct score in the testing phase. Each stimulus will be presented two times in testing and accuracy will be coded as 1 (correct) if on both presentations the participant made a correct response. If the item is classified incorrectly on 1 presentation or both presentations, the response for that item will be coded as 0 (incorrect). A threshold probability of 25% will be utilized to characterize performance as above chance and classify a participant as a learner under AGL Observational conditions.     Rule based learning task: For the rule-based task (described below), data are collected on the number of rules learned within the instruction period. Data are also collected on accuracy in testing. An accuracy score is computed for the test phase and is the dependent measure of rule learning. We will compute binomial chance probability. A threshold probability of 50% will be utilized to characterize performance as above chance and classify a participant as a learner under rule-based methods. Any participant whose score does not meet criterion, will be stratified as demonstrating selective weakness in rule-based learning.    Aim 2. Determine the predictors of observational and rule-based learning, incorporating subject-specific measures of structural brain damage, aphasia severity, attention, verbal working memory and executive function.    Calculations of lesion volume and spared tissue. Implicit and rule-based learning are thought to engage partially overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_392671], dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, thalamus, medial temporal lobe, superior and inferior parietal cortex, occipi[INVESTIGATOR_392672] (e.g.,Destrebecqz et al., 2005; Paniukov & Davis, 2018; Peigneux et al., 2000; Reber, 2013; Schneyer et al., 2009; Squire, 1992; Willingham et al., 2002). The amount of spared tissue within regions of this network will be calculated based on previously established methods (Kiran et al., 2015; Meier et al., 2016; Sims et al., 2016). For each PWA a lesion map, in which the lesioned voxels are 
Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form   Filename: [CONTACT_392705]:  October 15, 2014    7  assigned a binary value (1 or 0), are normalized from native to MNI space (a standard brain space utilized in imaging studies). The individualized lesion map is subtracted from each brain  region of interest (ROI) to yield the volume of spared tissue per ROI. The percentage of spared tissue in each region is calculated by [CONTACT_392694]. We will use MATLAB to identify the union of lesion maps and anatomical ROIs from the MNI template to compute lesion volume and percent spared tissue for each ROI. Percent spared tissue in ROIs will be entered into regression models evaluating predictors of learning.   Cognitive Linguistic Assessments: Language and cognitive assessments will be scored based on norms and methods of administration and scoring provided in testing manuals and publications.   Composite scores of sustained attention, executive function, and auditory-verbal working memory will be computed for entry into regression models.   Data Analyses: Linear regression models will be run to determine the predictors of learning.  Separate models will be examined for SRT observational, AGL observational and rule-based and learning. The dependent variable for SRT observational learning will be Cohen’s d effect size for the first round of learning computed in Aim 1. The dependent variable for AGL observational learning will be percent correct in testing computed in Aim 1. The dependent variable for rule-based learning is percent accuracy obtained in Aim 1.  We anticipate that accuracy rates will fall between .[ADDRESS_492893] shown differential activation in observational versus rule-based learning. Thus, for observational learning, the striatum, which shows enhanced engagement in implicit over rule based learning will be included (e.g. Destrebecqz et al., 2005; Peigneux et al., 2000; Schendan et al., 2003) along with composite scores of visual attention, as attention has been found to be important for implicit learning (e.g. Franklin et al., 2016; Seger 1994).  We will evaluate the statistical significance of a regression model with two predictors: percent spared tissue in the striatum and cognitive scores of attention, evaluating the statistical significance of the model and variability accounted for.   For rule-based learning, studies have identified the prefrontal cortex as an important neural substrate that shows increased engagement in rule-based relative to observational learning (e.g. By[CONTACT_129120]., 2016; Milton et al. 2009; Panuikov & Davis, 2018; Tracey et al., 2003). Verbal working memory and executive functions also play a rule in rule management and shifting (e.g. Carpenter et al., 2016).  Thus, we will evaluate the statistical significance of a regression model with three predictors: percent spared tissue in the prefrontal cortex and cognitive scores of working memory and executive function, evaluating the statistical significance of the model and variability accounted for.    Power estimations and justification of sample size. Power analysis for a multiple regression with two predictors was conducted in G*Power to determine a sufficient sample size using an alpha of 0.05. Using an effect size f2 = 0.25, based on correlations of .38 between striatal activation and implicit learning (Peigneux et al., 2000) and on correlation values of .[ADDRESS_492894] significant effects.  For rule-based learning, a power analysis was conducted in G*Power including [ADDRESS_492895] size f2 of .28 was estimated based on correlations between prefrontal

To achieve 85% power with an alpha of .05 a sample size of 49 is necessary.   Additional participants are included in this IRB to account for potential attrition and the possibility that some participants do not learn tasks limiting the interpretability of results.   Briefly describe study procedures.  Include any local site restrictions, for example, “Subjects enrolled at Partners will not participate in the pharmacokinetic portion of the study.”  Describe study endpoints.Participants who agree to participate and who provide informed consent will perform 3 to 5, sessions up to 2 hours long. Some participants may prefer to schedule testing over a series of several sessions, which will be accommodated. During these sessions, they will complete:  • SRT Observational (implicit) learning task • AGL Observational (implicit) learning task • Rule-based learning task • Cognitive-linguistic assessments  • Brain Scan   Learning tasks are computer based. Tasks involve looking at pi[INVESTIGATOR_499], shapes. listening to audio instructions and making button presses. Participants will receive audio and visual instructions. They will complete short practice blocks and have the opportunity to ask questions prior to completing tasks.   Observational (implicit) learning tasks (~ 45 mins):  Observational learning will be evaluated using two tasks: SRT observational learning and AGL observational learning.   The SRT Observational learning task is a classic paradigm, which has been integral to the understanding of implicit learning (see Schwarb & Schumacher, 2012). The SRT that we propose to use to characterize observational learning is a replication of classic SRT tasks first described by [CONTACT_392695] (1987), adapted for eye-tracking by [CONTACT_392696]. (2008) and pi[INVESTIGATOR_392673], young adult and older adult controls. During this task:   • Participants will be seated at least [ADDRESS_492896]. • The chin rest and chair level will be adjusted for comfort • The eyetracking camera will be focused on one of the participant’s eyes (right eye or dominant eye).  • Four geometric shapes will appear on screen  • A target dot will move from shape to shape  • Participants will be instructed to look at the dot as it moves from shape to shape via audio and visual instructions • For some study blocks, dot movement follows a pattern (sequenced blocks)  • For other study blocks, dot movement is pseudorandomized  The AGL Observational learning task is another classic test of implicit learning involving learning of ordered items through exposure (Schuchard & Thompson, 2017). Artificial grammars contain hierarchal dependencies, similar to the rules that govern word-order and syntax in natural language. Therefore, the artificial grammars may more evidently reveal learning deficits among 
Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form   Filename: [CONTACT_392705]:  October 15, 2014    9  PWA compared to the relatively simple serial reaction time (SRT) task (Schuchard & Thompson, 2017). During the AGL task:   • Participants will be seated a comfortable distance from a computer screen  • In an exposure phase, participants will look at pi[INVESTIGATOR_392674] a screen  • Participants will judge if two pi[INVESTIGATOR_392675]  • Responses are made via button press  • After training, participants complete a testing phase  • In testing, participants are informed that geometric sequences followed a pattern. Participants will be shown sequences and must judge if sequences adhere to the pattern or not via button press  
  Rule-based learning task (~30 mins):  To evaluate rule-based learning, participants will learn rules underlying an artificial grammar that contains hierarchical dependencies similar to the rules that govern word-order and syntax in natural language (Saffran, 2001) but are expressed in non-linguistic form (e.g. with shapes). In the rule-based task:  • Participants will be seated a comfortable distance from a computer screen  • Two to six geometric shapes will appear on screen  • Through visuals and audio instructions, participants will be taught rules of the grammar  • Once a rule is taught, participants answer yes/no questions related to the rule (see figure for examples).  • At the end of training, participants will be shown sequences and must judge if sequences adhere to the rules or not via button press   

Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form   Filename: [CONTACT_392705]:  October 15, [ADDRESS_492897] and talking.  Participants will be asked to do things such as:  • answer questions • follow directions • repeat words and phrases • look at pi[INVESTIGATOR_392676] • read and write short sentences  • complete mazes or find symbols • remember images and recognize them after a short delay • identify missing elements that complete a pattern  Brain Scan  For the brain scan, participants will be screened to ensure that there is no metal on their body or in their pockets. They will then lie on a table that is slid into the MRI scanner. Participant will be given earplugs and headphones to reduce the noise made by [CONTACT_168525]. Foam pads will be placed around their head to help it keep still during the MRI scan. Participants will be given a panic button that allows them to contact [CONTACT_392697]. Scan sessions are expected to take up to [ADDRESS_492898] of care at Partners (e.g., BWH, MGH) and indicate how the study procedures differ from standard care.  Provide information on available alternative treatments, procedures, or methods of diagnosis.N/A. This is not a treatment or diagnostic study   

Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form   Filename: [CONTACT_392705]:  October 15, [ADDRESS_492899] for diagnostic or treatment purposes. Minimizing risk during learning tasks and cognitive linguistic assessments: Participants may experience some frustration during the course of the study, however, this frustration is not expected not be more than that what would be faced in situations requiring focused, sustained attention for learning. A researcher will be present to answer any questions or concerns participants might experience and tasks will be tailored to a level that is appropriate for participants. Participants will be offered the opportunity for breaks.   Minimizing risk to confidentiality: To minimize confidentiality risks posed by [CONTACT_101198][INVESTIGATOR_007] (cognitive linguistic assessments), attempts will be made to position participants such that their faces are not captured in the videos.  Since it is possible that faces may appear in videos, all video material will be stored on a password protected network to which only IRB approved researchers have access.   Minimizing risks of eye-tracking: The potential for eye-damage due to the use of an infra-red eye-tracking sensor is extremely unlikely, due to the limited power and wavelength of the sensor, the short duration of the study, its distance from the participant, and the natural protective abilities of the eye.  The Eyelink 1000 Plus has been tested and approved by [CONTACT_392698] (IEC) [ADDRESS_492900] of photobiological safety of lamps and lamp systems is safe under any conditions, including using optical viewing devices and lenses.   There are minimal risks, eyestrain/slight discomfort being the most serious if eye safety instructions are not followed.  We will ensure that the following precautions are followed:  • Participants will be seated a minimum of 500mm (50cm) distance from the illuminator as recommended by [CONTACT_392699] a maximum viewing angle.    o Per manufacturer specifications, distances of under 100mm (4 inches) from the illuminator for an extended period of time, are those that may result in discomfort and unnecessary exposure to heat and levels of infrared (IR) light.   • The illuminator will be mounted on a manufacturer-provided desk mount to avoid unnecessary skin contact [CONTACT_392700].  Minimizing risks of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): There are no known physical, social, or legal risks or side effects associated with MRI scanning in this study. The magnetic fields used in this study are considered to be harmless and the proposed MRI scanning procedures fall within the FDA guidelines for radiofrequency electromagnetic field exposure. Electrically, magnetically or mechanically activated implants (e.g., cardiac pacemakers), clips on blood vessels in the brain, or other metallic objects in the body such as shrapnel, bullets, buckshot, or metal fragments pose a risk to participants entering an MRI scanner. Therefore, participants will be carefully screened as described below to ensure absence of these items. Although there are no known risks of an MRI scan to the unborn fetus, we will not permit participation by [CONTACT_392701].   Some participants may experience claustrophobia while in the bore of an MRI scanner. Participants will be asked to notify the PI [INVESTIGATOR_392677]. The MRI scanner makes loud knocking or beepi[INVESTIGATOR_392678], which are adequately reduced to a safe and comfortable level with earplugs and 
Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form   Filename: [CONTACT_392705]:  October 15, [ADDRESS_492901] from the study, for example, objective criteria for worsening disease/lack of improvement and/or unacceptable adverse events.  The inclusion of objective drop criteria is especially important in studies designed with placebo control groups.As described above, multiple measures will be taken to minimize risk including measures to limit the amount of identifiable data collected and/or visible on videotapes and clips.  Study codes will be utilized to maintain the privacy of files on a password protected network.  If patient privacy and confidentiality is compromised (if unapproved parties, for example access identifiable video clips), the IRB will be immediately notified.     As there are no known significant risks or side effects associated with procedures, objective criteria for removal are not necessary.  Participants may indicate at any point that they wish to discontinue their participation.    FORESEEABLE RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS Provide a brief description of any foreseeable risks and discomforts to subjects.  Include those related to drugs/devices/procedures being studied and/or administered/performed solely for research purposes.  In addition, include psychosocial risks, and risks related to privacy and confidentiality.  When applicable, describe risks to a developi[INVESTIGATOR_17779].Forseeable risks/discomforts of cognitive linguistic assessment: Videotapi[INVESTIGATOR_392679], for coding and transcription of data poses a risk to participant privacy and confidentiality.  Measures (described above) will be taken to limit the amount of identifiable data contained in videos, and data will be stored on a password protected network. In addition Zoom enterprise will be used which has additional restrictions on cloud storage etc. For individuals with aphasia, some tasks may be difficult and therefore frustrating.  This frustration is not to be more than that what would be faced in situations requiring focused, sustained attention for learning.  The participants will be asked to notify the researcher if at any time they feel uncomfortable or wish to stop participating, no matter what the reason.    Forseeable risks/discomforts of eye tracking: As indicated above, there are minimal risks associated with the eye-tracking device, the most serious being eye strain.  Participants will be informed of this risk during the consent process.  They will be able to withdraw from the study at any time should they experience discomfort.   Forseeable risks/discomforts of magnetic resonance imaging: All participants be screened prior to entry into the magnet room to ensure the absence of electrically, magnetically or mechanically activated implants (e.g., cardiac pacemakers), clips on blood vessels in the brain, or other metallic objects in the body such as shrapnel, bullets, buckshot, or metal fragments which pose a risk to participants entering an MRI scanner. Additionally, all participants will be asked to remove all metallic and magnetic objects in their possession (e.g., keys, jewelry, credit cards)

Participants’ hearing will be protected from the loud knocking or beepi[INVESTIGATOR_392680], which will reduce the noise to a safe and comfortable level.  EXPECTED BENEFITS Describe both the expected benefits to individual subjects participating in the research and the importance of the knowledge that may reasonably be expected to result from the study.  Provide a brief, realistic summary of potential benefits to subjects, for example, “It is hoped that the treatment will result in a partial reduction in tumor size in at least 25% of the enrolled subjects.”  Indicate how the results of the study will benefit future patients with the disease/condition being studied and/or society, e.g., through increased knowledge of human physiology or behavior, improved safety, or technological advances. No direct benefits are expected for participants. The current study is designed to address the important issue of learning after aphasia-inducing stroke. Speech-language therapy is the treatment for aphasia and relies heavily on behavioral therapi[INVESTIGATOR_392681], but are not currently evaluated. In order to better tailor treatment to individuals and more effectively predict outcomes, we must equip clinicians with ways to characterize learning in individual patients, further identifying stimulus or task manipulations that lead to the development of effective strategies for patients.    EQUITABLE SELECTION OF SUBJECTS The risks and benefits of the research must be fairly distributed among the populations that stand to benefit from it.  No group of persons, for example, men, women, pregnant women, children, and minorities, should be categorically excluded from the research without a good scientific or ethical reason to do so.  Please provide the basis for concluding that the study population is representative of the population that stands to potentially benefit from this research.There are no exclusionary subject criteria with respect to gender, race or ethnicity.   Minors will not be studied, as the incidence of stroke in younger individuals is low, and furthermore, the mechanisms of neural plasticity in adults and children are different, resulting in different impacts of stroke in children.    When people who do not speak English are excluded from participation in the research, provide the scientific rationale for doing so.  Individuals who do not speak English should not be denied participation in research simply because it is inconvenient to translate the consent form in different languages and to have an interpreter present.One aspect of this research is to examine learning in the context of language deficits. We are excluding non-English speakers because we are testing speech and language ability in the individuals with aphasia.   For guidance, refer to the following Partners policy:           Obtaining and Documenting Informed Consent of Subjects who do not Speak English          https://www.partners.org/Assets/Documents/Medical-Research/Clinical-Research/Non-English-Speaking-Subjects.pdf

Information about research studies will be posted on the Institute’s website.    Provide details of remuneration, when applicable.  Even when subjects may derive medical benefit from participation, it is often the case that extra hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6042], meals at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], parking fees or other inconveniences will result in additional out-of-pocket expenses related to study participation.  Investigators may wish to consider providing reimbursement for such expenses when funding is availableParticipants will be compensated for their time and participation in the study.  They will be compensated $10/hour of participation in behavioral sessions (anticipate ~ $70/participant to complete all behavioral tasks and assessments). Participants will be compensated more than $50 and therefore will be compensated via check. We will notify participants that a social security number and valid US address will be collected and reported in the MGB eCheck submission.   Participants who complete a structural scan will be compensated an additional $50.  Participants driving to the research site may park in the Building [ADDRESS_492904]. Participants will be given a parking voucher on each day of study participation that they can use in Parking garage buildings upon exit without incurring any personal costs.

For most studies involving more than minimal risk and all studies involving investigational drugs/devices, a licensed physician investigator must obtain informed consent.  When subjects are to be enrolled from among the investigators’ own patients, describe how the potential for coercion will be avoided.Once interest in participating in the study is expressed, one of the research staff involved in this study will establish contact [CONTACT_392702].  The research project will be explained and screening questions will be asked. and Interested persons will be invited to the research site to discuss the study.    The patient and his/her spouse/next of kin will be invited to the laboratory to discuss the study with a member of the research staff with speech-language pathology training and experience working with individuals with aphasia. In this meeting, research staff will explain the study using simple language.  She/he/they will also have sample materials from the study, such as pi[INVESTIGATOR_392682].  Extra care will be taken to ensure that subjects understand the nature of the study.  We will offer to read the consent form to these individuals as reading can be difficult, and information will be reiterated verbally.  Individuals and family members will be encouraged to interrupt, ask questions and seek clarifications.  They will be given time to assess presented information and formulate questions.  Individuals with aphasia are considered capable of making informed decisions and provide consent as indicated in the National Aphasia Association Bill of Rights (2005).  Therefore, family members may be present when study procedures are explained, but individuals with aphasia will be giving or declining to give informed consent.  The purpose, procedures, possible benefits and risks of the study will be explained.  Potential participants will also be instructed that they can withdraw from the study at any time.   NOTE: When subjects are unable to give consent due to age (minors) or impaired decision-making capacity, complete the forms for Research Involving Children as Subjects of Research and/or Research Involving Individuals with Impaired Decision-making Capacity, available on the New Submissions page on the PHRC website:       https://partnershealthcare.sharepoint.com/sites/phrmApply/aieipa/irb  For guidance, refer to the following Partners policy:      Informed Consent of Research Subjects:     https://www.partners.org/Assets/Documents/Medical-Research/Clinical-Research/Informed-Consent-of-Research-Subjects.pdf

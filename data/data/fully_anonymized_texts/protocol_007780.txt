attention control condition, and will complete an online post -test questionnaire. 
Participants will be contact[CONTACT_158361]-month later and will be asked to complete an online 
questionnaire. Completion of the pre -test, post-test, and one-month follow-up will take 
less than 15 minutes each. Completion of the intervention (or attention control condition) 
will take between [ADDRESS_836263] changes in knowledge, motivation, and behavioral skills

because you are a practicing dentist or resident in a Dental College.  The National 
Institutes of Health/National Institute on Drug Abuse sponsors the study . The investigator 
in charge of this study at MUSC is Jenna L. McCauley, PhD. Portions of Dr. McCauley 
and her research team’s salaries will be paid by [CONTACT_68793]. The study is being done at 
one site. Approximately [ADDRESS_836264] (immediately following intervention/control completion), and completion of 1 -month 
self-report follow -up assessment. 
If you agree to be in this study, the following will happen:  
1. You will respond to the study email ( [EMAIL_12006]) confirming that you
meet eligibility criteria for participation.
2. You will then be emailed a web -link and log-in credentials unique to you and
asked to follow the instructions to access the secure web -platform.
3. Following log -in to the site, you will complete a pre-test questionnaire.
4. After completing the pre-test questionnaire, you will be randomly assigned to
complete either the continuing dental education intervention or the attention
control condition.
5. You will then be directed to complete the post -test questionnaire. We ask that
you complete the pre-tes t, intervention/control, and post -test in one sitting if
possible, and in no more than 2 weeks if completed over multiple sittings .
6. You will be emailed approximately one -month later and asked to complete an
online (REDCap) follow-up questionnaire.
C.DURATION
Participation in the study will take about 2 hours during your initial participation (online) 
and approximately 15 minutes during your second participation (online)  over a period of 
approximately 1 month. 
D.RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS

will they provide any other form of identifying information during their completion of the 
ROPEs intervention/control. Further, de-identified (log-in coded) data will be collected and 
stored via a secure server. For participants completing the ROPEs data platform 
assessments, primary data will be housed on a secure MUSC server using Secure 
Sockets Layer 128-bit encryption. Further, assessment (pre-intervention, post-
intervention, one-month follow-up) data for this study will be stored electronically in de-
identified manner using participant identification numbers (USERID). Only members of the study team will have access to the linkage document associating USERID with 
identifying and contact [CONTACT_3031]. Identifying information will be used only for the 
purposes of participant reimbursement, linkage of assessment data from various time-
points, and contact [CONTACT_20687]-up. Participants’ identifying information and linkage to data 
USERID will be stored on a secure MUSC server in a password protected file and w ill be 
destroyed at the conclusion of the study. 
There is also a very low-probability risk that you may become offended by [CONTACT_627709][INVESTIGATOR_627705]. If this happens, you 
are free to terminate participation at any time or not respond to specific items on the 
questionnaires.

prove to be more effective than the other study condition and result in knowledge gained 
regarding (a) standard prescribing practices of dentists statewide; (b) the safe and appropriate use, storage, and disposal of opi[INVESTIGATOR_73409]; and (c) available 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_627706], although this cannot be guaranteed.

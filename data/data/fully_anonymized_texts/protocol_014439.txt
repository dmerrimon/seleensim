  3 2  INTRODUCTION  
 
2.1 STUDY RATIONALE   
Following orthopedic surgery, patients frequently experience pain and discomfort. Multiple methods of regional 
anesthesia are available; however, the optimal technique to adequately manage pain while minimizing 
complications remains under investigation in a rthroscopic shoulder surgery.  
 
2.[ADDRESS_1050065] for 
48-72 hours.  This  catheter is undesirable because it can become dislodged, requires the patient to manage it, as 
well as return days after surgery for removal.  
A modified form of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_765779] (liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]) has been shown to have a much 
long er duration of action than the traditional sodium channel blockers1.  It is long enough that it could cover the 
same duration of pain as an implanted catheter and has generated interest in its potential use to control 
postoperative pain.  Among patients un dergoing total shoulder replacement, liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_765780] -inferior to standard catheter treatment2-6, but there is a paucity of information on its use in rotator cuff 
repair7.  This study is meant to investigate the use of liposomal bu pi[INVESTIGATOR_765781], catheter -infused ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319].  
 
2.3 RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT    
 
2.3.1  KNOWN POTENTIAL RISKS  
Risks are no different than that of routine multi -modal pain control. This includes inadequate pain control, nausea, 
vomiting, opi[INVESTIGATOR_9827], infection, headache, respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341], opi[INVESTIGATOR_9827], hypotension, sedation, 
ileus, constipation, dry mouth, and gastric ulcers.  
 
2.3.2  KNOWN POTENTIAL BENEFITS  
 
The benefits of liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_765782], decreased narcotic use, and 
decreased catheter -associated complications including knotting and falling out. If it shows either superiority or 
even non -inferiority to the routine multi -modal pain management, its addition  will potentially decrease adverse 
outcomes of current procedures.  
 
3 STUDY DESIGN  
 
3.1 OVERALL DESIGN  
 Patients undergoing arthroscopic shoulder surgery were prospectively assessed after randomization into either 
ropi[INVESTIGATOR_765783] -injection liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_765784] (LB) arms. All patients were 
 Version 1.0 
 06 December  2023  
  4 discharged with 5 analgesics  (acetaminophen, methocarbamol, gabapentin, acetylsalicylic acid, and oxycodone) for 
as-needed pain relief. Preoperatively, p atient demographics  and baseline Visual Analog Scale, Single Assessment 
Numeric Evaluation, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons, and  Penn Shoulder Scores were obtained. For the 
first four days postoperatively, complication rates (nausea, dyspnea, anesthet ic site discomfort  and/or irritation 
and/or leakage, and self -reported concerns and complications), pain, medication usage, and sleep data were 
assessed  by [CONTACT_754718] 12 hours. The primary outcome was overall complication rate. At 12 weeks 
postoper atively, Visual Analog Scale,  Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation, American Shoulder and Elbow 
Surgeons, and Penn scores were reassessed. Outcome scores  were compared with Mann -Whitney U tests, and 
demographics were compared with chi -squared tests. Signif icance was set at P <.[ADDRESS_1050066] ASES, SANE, and Penn shoulder scores calculated.  This will 
conclude their participation in the study.

7 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES  
 
 Version 1.0 
 06 December  2023  
  6 7.1 STUDY  ASSESSMENTS  
 
• twice -daily phone calls for the first [ADDRESS_1050071] -surgery  
 
At each phone call,  the following surveys will be performed:  
• Medication Intake Survey  
o Since the last phone call: 
▪ Which medications have been consumed?  
▪ How many pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353]?  
• Pain Survey  
o On a scale of [ADDRESS_1050072], what is your pain right now?  
• Sleep Quality Survey  
o On a scale of [ADDRESS_1050073] night?  
o How many hours were you able to sleep before being interrupted by [CONTACT_77368]?  
 
7.2 ADVERSE EVENTS AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
   
7.2.1  DEFINITION OF ADVERSE EVENTS  (AE)  
Adverse event means any untoward medical occurren ce associated with the use of an intervention in 
humans, whether  or not considered intervention -related (21 CFR 312.32 (a)).  
 
7.2.2  DEFINITION OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  (SAE)  
An adverse event (AE)  is considered “serious ” if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, it 
results in any of the following outcomes:  
 
• Death  
• A life-threatening adverse event  (of note, the term “life -threatening” refers to an event in which 
the subject was at risk of death at the time of t he event , rather than to an event which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe ) 
• inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal 
life functions  
• or a congenital anomaly/birth defect . 
 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6721], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may je opardize the 
subject  and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this 
definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment 
in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or con vulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
 
7.2.3  CLASSIFICATION OF AN ADVERSE EVENT  
[IP_ADDRESS]  SEVERITY OF EVENT  
For adverse events (AE s), the following guidelines will be used to describe severi ty:  
 
 Version 1.0 
 06 December  2023  
  7 • Mild – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the subject ’s daily 
activities.   
• Moderate  – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic 
measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functi oning.  
• Severe  – Events interrupt a subject ’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug therapy 
or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life -threatening or incapacitating.   Of 
note, the term “severe” does not necessarily equate to  “serious .” 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  RELATIONSHIP TO STUDY INTERVENTION  
All adverse events ( AEs) must have their relationship to study intervention  assessed  by [CONTACT_139458]/her clinical judgment. The 
degree of certainty about causality will be graded using the categories below. In a clinical trial, the study 
product must always be suspect.  
 
• Related  – The AE is known to occur with the st udy intervention , there is a reasonable possibility 
that the study intervention  caused the AE, or there is a temporal relationship between the study 
intervention  and event. Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationshi p between the study intervention  and the AE. 
• Not Related  – There is not a reasonable possibility that the administration of the study 
intervention  caused the event, there is no temporal relationship between the study intervention  
and event onset , or an alternate etiology has been established.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  EXPECTEDNESS  
The Principal Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_21190] ( AE) is expected 
or unexpected.  An AE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is 
not consistent with the risk information previously described for the study intervention . 
7.2.4  TIME PERIOD AND FREQUENCY FOR EVENT ASSESSMENT AND FOLLOW -UP 
The occurrence of an  adverse event ( AE) or serious adverse event ( SAE) may come to the attention of 
study personnel during study visits and interviews of a study subject  presenting for medical care, or 
upon review by a study monitor.  
 
All AEs including local and systemic reac tions not meeting the criteria for SAEs will be captured on the 
appropriate  case report form  (CRF). Information to be collected includes event description, time of 
onset, clinician’s assessment of severity, relationship to study product (assessed only by t hose with the 
training and authority to make a diagnosis), and time of resolution/stabilization of the event. All AEs 
occurring while on study must be documented appropriately regardless of relationship. All AEs will be 
followed to adequate resolution.  
 
Any medical condition that is present at the time that the subject  is screened will be considered as 
baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if the study subject ’s condition  deteriorates at any time 
during the study, it will be recorded as an AE.  
 
Chan ges in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event 
at each level of severity  to be performed. A Es characterized as intermittent require documentation of 
onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].  
 
 Version 1.[ADDRESS_1050074] all reportable events with start dates occurring any time after 
informed consent is obtained until 7 (for non -serious AEs) or 30 days (for SAEs) after the last day of 
study participation.  At each study visit, the Study Coordinator  will in quire about the occurrence of 
AE/SAEs since the last visit.  Events will be followed for outcome information until resolution or 
stabilization.  
 
7.2.[ADDRESS_1050075] 
include an assessment of whether there is a reasonable possibility th at the study intervention caused 
the event. Study endpoints that are serious adverse events (e.g., all -cause mortality) must be reported 
in accordance with the protocol unless there is evidence suggesting a causal relationship between the 
study interventio n and the event (e.g., death from anaphylaxis). In that case, the investigator must 
immediately report the event to the sponsor.  
 
All serious adverse events ( SAEs ) will be followed until satisfactory resolution or until the Principal 
Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_653891]. Other supporting documentation of 
the event may be requested and should be provided as soon as possible.  
 
7.3 UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS  
 
7.3.1  DEFINITION OF UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS (UP)  
The Office for Human Research Protections ( OHRP ) considers unanticipated problems involving risks to 
subject s or others to include, in general, any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the 
following criteria:  
 
• Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures that are 
described in the protocol -related documents, such as the Institutional Review Board ( IRB)-
approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the 
subject  population being studied;  
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means there is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_765797]); and  
• Suggests that the research places subject s or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  
 
7.3.2   UNANTICIPATED PROBLEM REPORTING  
The investigator  will report unanticipated problems (UP s) to the reviewing Institutional Review Board 
(IRB). The UP report will include the following information:  
 
• Protocol identifying information: protocol title and number, PI’s name, and the IRB project 
numbe r; 
• A detailed description of the event, incident, experience, or outcome;  
• An explanation of the basis for determining that the event, incident, experience, or outcome 
represents an UP;  
 Version 1.0 
 06 December  2023  
  9 • A description of any changes to the protocol or other corrective acti ons that have been taken or 
are proposed in response to the UP. 
 
To satisfy the requirement for prompt reporting, UPs will be reported using the following timeline:   
 
• UPs that are serious adverse events (SAE s) will be reported to the IRB within 10 working  days  of 
the investigator becoming aware of the event.  
• Any other UP will be reported to the IRB within 10 working days  of the investigator becoming 
aware of the problem.  
 
 
8 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS   
 
8.1 STATISTICAL HYPOTHESES  
 
• Primary Efficacy Endpoint(s): Postoperative Pain Scores  
 
 
• Secondary Efficacy Endpoint(s):  Postoperative Oral Morphine Equivalents , Analgesia 
Satisfaction, Analgesia Complications, Sleep Quality, and Hours of Painless Sleep  
 
 
8.2 SAMPLE SIZE  DETERMINATION  
 
A po wer analysis was conducted at 0.8 with an alpha of  0.05, using liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_765787].  
 
 
8.3 STATISTICAL ANALYSES  
 
Data analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for  Macintosh, version 27 (IBM Corp., Armonk, 
NY, [LOCATION_003]). Prior to  study arm comparison, a Shapi[INVESTIGATOR_2152] -Wilk test was performed, which  indicated non -
normally distributed data.  
Patient age,  BMI, operative time, perioperative pain scores, medication consumption,  duration and 
quality of slee p, satisfaction, and preoperative  and postoperative PROMs (VAS, SANE, ASES, and PSS)  
were compared using Mann -Whitney U tests.  
Additional patient demographics, including gender, smokable tobacco consumption, intraoperative 
complications, ASA classification , CCI scores, surgical procedures, and 6 perioperative complications 
(nausea,  dyspnea, anesthetic site discomfort and/or irritation and/or  leakage, and self -reported 
complications), were compared with chi -squared tests. Graded measures, such as anesthetic site 
discomfort and irritation, were dichotomized based on severity, into ‘‘none -to-mild’’ and ‘‘moderate -to-
severe’’ categories for analysis. Statistical significance was set to P < .05.

9.1.1  INFORMED CONSENT PROCESS  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  CONSENT/ASSENT AND OTHER INFORMATIONAL DOCUMENTS PROVIDED TO SUBJECT S 
Consent forms describing in detail the study intervention , study procedures, and risks are given to the 
subject  and written documentation of informed consent is required prior to conducting study screening 
procedures . A separate screening consent form will not be used.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  CONSENT PROCEDURES AND DOCUMENTATION  
Informed consent is a process that is initiated prior to the individual’s agreeing to participate in the 
study and continues throughout the individual’s study participation.  Consent forms will be Institutional 
Review Board ( IRB)-approved and the subject  will be asked to read and review the document. The 
investigator will explain the research study to the subject  and answer any questions that may arise. A 
verbal explanation will be provided in terms suited to the  subject ’s comprehension of the purposes, 
proc edures, and potential risks of the study and of their rights as research subject s.  Subject s will have 
the opportunity to carefully review the written consent form and ask questions prior to signing.  The 
subject s should have the opportunity to discuss the study with their family or surrogates or think about 
it prior to agreeing to participate. The subject  will sign the informed consent document prior to any 
procedures being done specifically for the study.  Subject s must be informed that participation is 
voluntary and that they may withdraw from the study at any time, without prejudice.  A copy of the 
informed consent document will be given to the subject s for their records. The informed consent 
process will be condu cted and  documented in the source document (including the date), and the form 
signed, before the subject  undergoes any study -specific procedures.  The rights and welfare of the 
subject s will be protected by [CONTACT_179961].  
9.1.2  STUDY DISCONTINUATION AND CLOSURE  
This study may be temporarily suspended or prematurely terminated if there is sufficient reasonable 
cause.  Written notification, docume nting the reason for study suspension or termination, will be 
provided by [CONTACT_391333].  If the study is prematurely 
terminated or suspended, the  Principal Investigator ( PI) will promptly inform study subjec ts and the 
Institutional Review Board ( IRB), will provide the reason(s) for the termination or suspension.  Study 
subject s will be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], as applicable, and be informed of changes to study visit schedule.  
  
Circumstances that may warrant termination or  suspension include, but are not limited to:  
• Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to subject s 
• Demonstration of efficacy that would warrant stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]

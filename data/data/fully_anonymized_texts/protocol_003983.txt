 1. Purpose of the study  
In this study, the feasibility of delivering a  time-restricted eating (TRE ) intervention among 
fatigued cancer survivors  will be assessed . The participant s will be asked to eat ad libitum  only within a  
self-selected [ADDRESS_290293] -intervention . These feasibility data will be used as 
preliminary data for a grant proposal addressin g one of NCI’s Provocative Questions: “How does 
intermittent fasting affect cancer incidence, treatment response, or outcome? ”1 
The feasibility of conducting a 10 -h TRE intervention among cancer survivors will be ev aluated 
using the following specific aims:  
Primary Aim: to assess  the adherence of the participants to the 10 -h TRE intervention. This will be 
determined by [CONTACT_239252] 10 -h TRE dietary pattern over the 
course o f the 14 -day intervention.  
Secondary Aim 1 : to assess  the retention of participants during the [ADDRESS_290294] -intervention 
assessments.  
Secondary Aim 2 : to assess the safety of the TRE intervention. We will closely monitor instances of adverse 
events as described by [CONTACT_239253]  (CTCAE), version 5,2 with 
a special focus on body weight.  
Secondary Aim 3: to describe  the feasibility of recruiting cancer survivors to a 10 -h TRE  intervention . The 
number consented over the nu mber approached will be calculated, and the population (i.e., those 
approached) will be characterized based on eligibility and willingness to participate .  
 
2. Background and rationale   
 Cancer -related fatigue affects at least 30 -90% of patients undergoing  chemotherapy , depending on 
the type of cancer and treatment  as well as the diagnosis method .3,[ADDRESS_290295], and 
its severity can greatly hinder the ability to perform activities of daily living and decrease quality of life. 
The mechanisms behind the etiology and pathophysiology of cancer -related fatigue seem to be related in 
part to inflammation,  hypothalamic –pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117] –adrenal (HPA) activation dysfunction, metabolic and/or 
endocrine dysregulation, or other mechanisms,  but are largely not understood, thereby [CONTACT_239254] .5  
 Circadian rhythms are biological diurnal cycles that work in synchrony to regulate hormone 
secretion, the sleep/wake c ycle, core body temperature, and other processes. Circadian rhythm and human 
health have a bidirectional relationship, and circadian disruption is associated with a broad range of 
pathologies including, purportedly, cancer -related fatigue.6-8 Circadian regulation occurs via genetic and 
physiological processes, and is important to maintain homeostasis of the endocrine system,  autonomic 
nervous system, and nutrient metabolism .9,10 The importa nce of maintaining circadian rhythm is clear when 
traveling across time zones, and “jet lag” is a common experience of fatigue when the circadian clock is 
disrupted.10 Our group ( Division  of Cancer Control ) has demonstrated that chemotherapy disrupts circadian 
rhythm, and that changes in circadian rhythm are associated with fatigue.8 Further, research from our group 
has shown  that yoga can help regulate biobehavioral oscillations of circadian rhythm and, consequentially, 
improve sleep and reduce fatigue.11  
Regulation of circadian rhythm relies heavily on regular sleep  habits, and i nterventions to regulate 
circadian clock currently include light therapy, exercise , melatonin  supplementation , and more recently,

 nutrient tim ing.10 Indeed, there are consistent animal and human data demonstrating that aberrant 
feedin g/eating patterns  dysregulate  objective circadian clock measures (i.e., expression of genes that show 
strong diurnal oscillations).12 In an observational study among 156 healthy American  adult s in [LOCATION_004], 
Gill and Panda13 showed that approximately 50%  of people  eat within a  window greater than 14.75 
hours per day ; only 10% eat within a window [ADDRESS_290296] 
health  outcomes.9,14,15 Restricting eating to certa in time window is called  “time -restricted eating” (TRE).  
 TRE as a therapeutic approach has garnered a large appreciation in the literature and in the public 
in the last decade for its ability to mediate the circadian clock and prevent and treat various pathologies.14,[ADDRESS_290297] ing the consumption of calories to a short window (4 -12 hours)  during nor mal waking 
hours, for example 8 am-6pm; water is never restricted. Human (time -restricted eating) and rodent (time -
restricted fe eding) studies have shown that TRE  helps to maintain metabolic homeostasis and, as a result, 
prevents excess body weight, improves sleep, and attenuates age - and diet -induced heart disease (review15). 
One study clearly demonstrated the effects of nutrient ti ming on metabolic regulation:  time-restricted 
feeding vs . time -unrestricted feeding of mice led to weight loss despi[INVESTIGATOR_239235].16 In humans, 
Gabel et al. performed an 8 -h TRE  study among obese adults for 12 weeks (n=23).17 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_239236] , caloric intake decreased 341±53 kcal/day. Body weight decrease d 2.6±0.5%, and systolic blood 
pressure decreased 7±2 mmHg. However,  there were no significant changes in body composition, circulated 
lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], fasting blood glucose, or fasting insulin.  Also, Wilkinson et al. performed a 10 -h time restricted 
eating study among patients with metabolic syndrome for 12 weeks (n=19).9 They observed improvements  
in sleep efficiency and quality, a safe rate of decrease in body weight and body fat percentage, a reduction 
in total and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and reductions in systolic and diastolic blood 
pressure.[ADDRESS_290298] been seen in glucose  and lipid 
metabolism and  circadian clock gene expression in as short as 4 days.18 
 To date, TRE has only been studied in healthy participants or those who are overweight, obese, or 
with metabolic syndrome ( Wilkinson et al.9 and references within). These studies have collectively shown 
that a 10 -h TRE window is feasible, safe, and effective at improving metabolic markers  among their 
respective populations . Thus, the next logical step is to prudently  begin to apply a dietary pattern 
intervention  to cancer survivors with the ultimate goal of evaluating its effectiveness to treat cancer -related 
fatigue. Thus, herein, a single -arm pi[INVESTIGATOR_239237] a TRE intervention and adherence of survivors to a 10 -h TRE window 
for 2 weeks. These data will serve as preliminary data for an R21 grant application in response to a 
Provocative Question posed by [CONTACT_6812]: “ PQ2: How does intermittent fasting affect cancer incidence, 
treatment response, or outcome? ”[ADDRESS_290299] routine follow -up appointments . Alternatively, patients 
referred to the study team by [CONTACT_239255], emailed, or sent a letter giving them basic 
information about the study.  These clinics include  Wilmot Cancer Institute , Pluta Cancer Center, or another 
Wilmot satellite location. Private areas in any of these locations may be used to consent the participant  and

 do study assessments. Participants will also be asked to complete some of the ass essments at home.  As an 
alternative to clinic visits , this entire study can be completed remotely.  
 
4. Study design  
4.1 Brief description and s pecific  aims  
 This will be a single -arm feasibility pi[INVESTIGATOR_239238]  40 cancer survivors  with moderate to severe  
baseline fatigue . All participant s in this study will be asked to follow a TRE  meal pattern for 14  consecutive 
days. Participants will be encouraged to consume food and beverages only within a  10-h time window for 
the 14 -day intervention , with the exception of water , which will be encouraged at any time. Participants 
will be allowed to take any of their normal medications at the prescribed times. Participant s will be aske d 
to complete a daily diary ( every day for 14 days, approximately 1  min each da y), as described in §4.4. At 
baseline, mi d-point, and post -intervention , participant s will be asked to record their body weight  with a 
scale that the study team  will provide . Also at baseline and  post-intervention, participant s will complete 
questionnaires  related to their fatigue , quality of life , symptoms, and a 24 -h food recall  (approximately 10 
min). Post -intervention , we will conduct an exit inte rview  with each participant  about their experience with 
the intervention (10 -30 min).  
 
Primary Aim : to asses s the adherence of the participants to the 10 -h TRE intervention. This will be 
determined by [CONTACT_239252] 10 -h TRE dietary pattern over the 
course of the 14 -day intervention.  
Secondary Aim 1 : to assess the retent ion of participants during the [ADDRESS_290300] -intervention 
assessments.  
Secondary Aim 2 : to assess the safety of the TRE intervention. We will closely mo nitor instances of adverse 
events as described by [CONTACT_140069]  (CTCAE), version 5,2 with 
a special focus on body weight.  
Secondary Aim 3: to describe the feasibility of recruiting cancer survivors to a 10 -h TRE intervention. The 
number consented over the number approached will be calculated, and the population (i.e., those 
approached) will be characterized based on eligibility and willingn ess to participate.  
 
4.2 Participant  population  
In total,  40 cancer survivors will be recruited . Participant s will be recruited from Wilmot Cancer 
Institute  including satellite clinic s (e.g., Pluta  Cancer Center ) and will have medical clearance  from their  
provider . From previous local studies comple ted by [CONTACT_239256] , a 20 % rate  of attrition  
is expected , resulting in approximately 32 participants with evaluable data.  
No special classes of participant s such as fetuses, neonates, children, pregnant women, prisoners, 
institutionalized individuals, or decisionally impaired adults will be recruited.

[CONTACT_239260], will not be included because their meal timing  is often determined by 
[CONTACT_239261]/guardians/caregivers.  
 
4.3 Study interventions  
 This will be a single -arm, feasibility pi[INVESTIGATOR_239239] t recruits 40 cancer survivors. After screening 
and consent, participant s will complete an on -study form and baseline questionnaires: the Functional 
Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT -F), Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI), the [ADDRESS_290302] . These questionnaires can be 
completed either online via REDCap or on paper (participant’s c hoice)  and take less than 10 min total to 
complete. Participants will be provided with  a small bathroom scale, with which they will be asked to report 
their weight at baseline  (Day 1) , mid -point ( Day 8), and post -intervention  (Day 15) . We prefer that body 
weight is measured at home, in the morning, b efore food or drink is ingested , without clothing . Before the 
intervention period , all participant s will be instructed as to how to follow a TRE  diet pattern. The TRE  
window will be 10  hours long and will be selected by [CONTACT_239262]. For ex ample, the window could be 7am -5pm, 8:30am -6:30pm,  or 12:00pm -10:00 pm. 
However, the window should not change  during the intervention period . Every day f or 14  days, participant s 
will be asked to consume food  and beverages only within the 10 -h window ; water will be allowable any 
time. Because of the potential of caffeine and artificial sweeteners to affect circadian rhythm,19,20 coffee, 
tea, chewing gum, and diet beverages will be discouraged during the  fasting window. Also for these 1 4 
days, participant s will complete a daily diary at  the end of the day noting the time they wake up, the time

Version Date:  [ADDRESS_290303] calorie , the time they go to bed, and their average fatigue level for 
the day .  
There will be an emphasis on  honesty over adherence, and participants’  experiences will be used 
to improve the intervention in a larger, future study. Post -intervention , the participant s will be asked to 
complete the same questionnaires as baseline (i.e., FACIT -F, BFI, Symptom Inventory , 24-h Estimated 
Food Record ), and body  weight will be measured . An exit interview will be conducted to assess what the 
participant s did and did not like about the intervention; if they think it improved their symptoms, sleep 
quality, or quality of life; what tips they have for future participa nts; if they would recommend the eating 
pattern to friends; or any other constructive comments . This interview will last [ADDRESS_290304] the option of completing all the questionnai res and daily diaries electronically 
or on paper . Similarly, exit interviews can be completed on -site or via phone according to patient 
preference. Participant s will be compensated for their time $10 for baseline assessments , $10 to complete 
daily diaries,  and $[ADDRESS_290305] -intervention assessments for a total of $30 maximum . 
All questionnaires will be scored and entered into a secure database by [CONTACT_3476]. Adherence 
will be the primary end -point; it is expect ed that participants will be able to eat wit hin the 10-h window at 
least 5 -6 out of 7 days per week,17,21 or 11/14 day s (78.6% adherence).  In regard to reten tion, we expect 
that at least 32/4 0 (80%) of participants who complete baseline assessments will complete post -intervention 
assessments. Changes in quality of life and fatigue will be assessed over time as exploratory  measures.  
 
4.4 Study outcomes/endpoints  
The primary aim of this study is adherence, as assessed using daily diaries . How many days the 
participant s were able t o restrict their eating to the [ADDRESS_290306] 11 of the 1 4 days on avera ge. This goal is reasonable based on a study by [CONTACT_239263]üs et al.,21 whose 
participants adhered to this dietary pattern 85.5 ± 15.2% of days over a three -month intervention, and a 
study by [CONTACT_239264].,17 whose participant s adhered 5.6 ± 0. 3 days/week (80%) for 12 weeks  on average.   
A secondary aim is retentio n; it is expected that  at least 80% (32 out of 4 0) of those who provide 
baseline  data also provide post -intervention data.  
Another secondary aim will be safety. We hypothesize that body  weight will be maintained within 
5% of baseline throughout the intervention and that there will be no adverse events that are Grade [ADDRESS_290307] to weight loss, body weight  will 
be measured three times: baseline  (Day 1) , mid-point ( Day 8), and post -intervention (Day 15 ). Body weight 
will be measured by [CONTACT_239265] a scale that is provide d, and then reported on the daily diary (e.g., 
BalanceFrom Digital Body Weight Bathroom Scale ). To ensure consistent and reliable m easures, 
participant s will be asked to weigh themselves in the morning, before eating or drinking, with minimal 
clothing. The scale should be  placed on a hard, level surface (e.g., tile, wood) that is the same for each 
measurement , if possible,  because the re can be slight variations  in measurement s if the scale is placed on a 
rug vs. a hardwood floor, for example.  Participants will have the option of keepi[INVESTIGATOR_239240].   
To ensure safety in regard to adverse events , we will closely mo nitor all adverse events as described 
by [CONTACT_12397] , version 5.[ADDRESS_290308] due to potential causality 
include weight loss or weight gain (see §9.1.1), dizziness, and exacerbation of fatigue.

before the intervention (their n ormal diet  and dietary pattern ). This will be done prospectively on any day 
before they begin the TRE intervention. The [ADDRESS_290310]  will be analyzed for total calories, 
macronutrients, micronutrients, and bioactive  compound s using Nutrition Data System f or Research 
(NDSR; Regents of the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN)  or a similar program.  
An exploratory  aim of this study is cancer -related fatigue, as assessed using the FACIT -F, BFI, and 
Symptom Inventory . Patients will complete these  instrument s at baseline and post -intervention.  
1. Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness -Fatigue (FACIT -F) questionnaire : The FACIT -F is a 40 -
item, validated, commonly used measure o f fatigue that is comprised of five  subscales: physical 
well-being, social well -being, emotional well -being, functional well -being, and fatigue.[ADDRESS_290311] 7 days.  
2. Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) : The BFI is a [ADDRESS_290312] 24 h. It also includes 
6 single -item questions regarding how fatigue has interfered with general activity, mood, work, etc.  
3. Symptom Inventory (SI) : The sympt om inventory ( modified from  the MD Anderson Symptom 
Inventory24) includes 19 items that are  common in the cancer experience (e.g., pain, distress, lack 
of appetite, numbness and tingling, fatigue), as well as 8 items related to how much these symptoms 
interfere with activities of daily living and quality of life. As many symptoms often correlate  with 
each other including fatigue (i.e., symptom clustering25), it is important to capture the change in 
many symptoms from baseline to post -intervention. Exploratory analyses will probe whether 
adherence to the diet or high consumption of any dietary component correlates with the change in 
any of these symp toms over the two -week intervention .  
 
There are a total of six questionnaires and survey assessments that will be completed . The on -study form 
will be completed at baseline only; the daily diary will be completed during the intervention; the others will 
be completed at baseline  and post -intervention : 
 On study (demographics and clinical characteristics; baseline only)  
 FACIT -F (Fatigue and quality of life)  
 BFI (fatigue)  
 Symptom inventory  
 24-h Food Record  
 Daily diary

 will be submitted in the Summer  2020.1 It is also anticipated  that one manuscript  will also emerge from this 
study, which will be submitted for publication within one year of the study closing.   
 
4.6 Design considerations  
 Why a 10-hr TRE  pattern ? Intermittent fasting has gained a lot of interest in the last decade due 
to its strong pre -clinical data supporting its a bility to regulate circadian rhythm, improve homeostatic 
metabolism, and alleviate age -related morbidities.14 The investigators  and the NCI believe that it will be a 
promising lifestyle intervention to alleviate symptoms of cancer and side effects of treatment.1 Intermittent 
fasting protocols include more extreme patterns (e.g., alternate day fasting ,26 as well as TRE  with shorter 
time windows, such as 4 -h27). However, most human studies thus far have been performed among healthy 
participant s, and especially participant s who are overweight. It is hypothesized  that [ADDRESS_290314] 
window that can be implement ed that will be safe , effective,  and not too uncomfortable for the participant s. 
With a 10 -h window, none of the three traditional meals (e.g., breakfast, lunch, dinner) have to be “skipped,” 
though mea ls might need to be shifted.  The primary goal is for the diet pattern in this line of research is to 
regulate circadian rhythm, not induce caloric restriction.  
 Why in survivorship vs. during adjuvant treatment ? Participant s will be recruited 4  months –5 
years after chemotherapy, surgery, and/or radiation for curative intent . Thus, their immediate, acute side 
effects of treatment will have subsided though persistent side effects will still be present. It is thought  that 
survivors will have enough physical and me ntal resources to adhere to a change in diet pattern, while 
patients actively undergoing treatment will have a much harder time.  
Why a 14 -day duration ? Studies that have implemented TRE  interventions have used a wide 
range of intervention lengths, from [ADDRESS_290315] shown measurable effects 
on vigor (similar to fatigue) in 10 days.28 The main outcome here in is feasibility to recruit and retain 
participants, and it is thought  that 14 days  is an appropriate amount of time to kno w if someone will be 
willing to adhere to a short -term lifestyle change . Two weeks includes two full weeks including weekends, 
and is thus better than 10 days so that the presence (or absence) of weekend social activities during the 
intervention is not a b iasing factor.  
Should we directly monitor glycemia?  It is possible that this intervention could lead to 
hypoglycemia among individuals who are at risk due to the presence of type [ADDRESS_290316], TRE shows glycemic benefits for 
individuals with prediabetes32 as well as overweight individuals.18 Specifically, Singh et al. rec ruited 32 
patients with a high risk of cardiovascular disease (nine  with type 2 diabetes); participants  consumed the 
vast majority of their calories in the evening (a calorie restrictive protocol that is more extreme that the one 
proposed herein) including  no breakfast and there were no hypoglycemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841].30 In addition , Arnason 
et al. encouraged  10 patients with type 2 diabetes who were taking metformin consume all their food within 
a 4-6 hour eating win dow (shorter than the proposed 10 -hour window) ; they observed zero instances of 
hypoglycemia and concluded that the regimen was safe for this population.31 Thus, we are excluding 
individuals on insulin therapy, and w e will require approval from each potential participant’s oncologist . 
In the sign -off form, we will  emphasize that he or she should reach out to the primary care provider to 
ensur e that the patient is not in this “high risk” group.

6. Recruitment methods  
6.[ADDRESS_290321]. Kleckner or a member of the study team will recruit participants using the Cancer Control 
group’s established procedures. Before recruitment approval will be obtained by [CONTACT_92959] P. Wilmot 
Cancer Institute  Clinical Trials Peer Review and Monitoring Committee (PR MC) as well as the University 
of [COMPANY_002]ster Medical Center (URMC) Research Subject Review Board (RS RB). Potential participants will 
be identified  using three  methods: (1) screening  medical records , (2) direct referral from provid ers (e.g., 
nurses and physicians ), and (3) flyers .  
 
6.1.1 Identification and recruitment via medical records  
Potentially eligible participants receiving care at the URMC will be identified in a HIPAA -
compliant manner by [CONTACT_239267]. The study team 
will then review any potential candidates. Medical records typi[INVESTIGATOR_239241] v. 01/22/2019

 therapy (e.g., surgery, chemotherapy) . If an individual appears to be eligible, the study team will contact 
[CONTACT_19203]  (or a designee) to notify them of a potential candidate and obtain approval to spea k 
with the patient. The provider  (or a designee) will approach the potential participant at a regularly scheduled 
oncology appointment. This initial contact [CONTACT_239268] a clinical trial to invest igate the feasibility to implement a TRE dietary intervention . If the 
person  is interested, the provider  will refer the individual to the study team. The study team will then meet 
with the candidate in a private room to discuss the study activities in deta il and review eligibility  (either 
that day or at a later date) . If the person  is eligible, study personnel will explain the details of the study . 
Study personnel can obtain informed consent right then or at a later date  from those who agree to participate.  
After consent is provided, the participant  will be provided with study materials.  
 
6.1.[ADDRESS_290322] referral from physicians , physician assistants, and  nurses  
The study team is  working with several oncologists (including, but not limited to  the medical 
monitor  [CONTACT_239288] ) and his medical team (e.g., nurses , physician assistants ) to identify potential patients 
at the University of [COMPANY_002]ster who are likely eligible for our study. I f the patient is eligible based on 
information in the medical records and from the physician and medical team, the provider  will be asked to 
refer the person  to the study team  (or obtain the physician’s permission to contact [CONTACT_108443] ) to discuss 
this study.

6.2 Screening  
For convenience to the potential participant , the person’s clinic appointment might be combined 
with their screening and consent , or participants can undergo t he screening and consent process remotely 
via eConsent . To protect the privacy of potential participant s, face-to-face recruitment discussions will be 
conducted in a private location.  
[CONTACT_239289]  or a member of the study team will meet the potential participant  in person or talk to 
them over the phone to explain the project  and invite  them to participate. It is expect ed that some patients 
will decline to participate , and some will not be eligible;13 approaching the same individual twice will be 
avoided  by [CONTACT_239270] a screening log containing the following information:  
 Screening ID (1, 2, 3,…)  
 Name

 Whether the patient was eligible or not  
 If ineligible, the reason they are ineligible  
 Whether the patient ultimately consented or declined  
 If declined consent, the reason for declining consent

7.[ADDRESS_290324]. Kleckner  
(study chair) will be available to answer any questions the potential participant  may have about any aspect 
of the study prior to consenting and throughout the entire study period.  The participant s will also have 
access to the dieti tians at the Integrative Oncology and Wellness Center at Pluta Cancer Center (e.g., Sue 
Czap, RD)  if they have other diet -related questions . Potential participant s will be allowed  to take the consent 
form home to think about and discuss with family or friends ; each potential participant will have sufficient 
time to consider participation . To minimize coercion, the study team will emphasize that  participation is 
completely voluntary and  their cancer care will not be affected by [CONTACT_47361].  
 
7.[ADDRESS_290325]  via the following methods: 1) the treating 
oncologist or a member of the medical team (e.g., nurse practitioner) will introduce the study t o the 
participant via a clinic  appointment (in person or telehealth) and inquire if it would be okay for our study 
team to contact [CONTACT_476] , 2) with approval of the treating oncologist or a designee, a recruitment letter will be 
mailed to the potential participant briefly describing the study and asking them to contact [CONTACT_239271], and 3) with appr oval of the treating oncologist or a designee, a message will be sent 
to the potential participant via eRecord (myChart) briefly describing the study and asking them to contact 
[CONTACT_239272]. If a potential participant is intereste d, the study team will talk to 
the person on the phone and obtain verbal permission from the patient to send a copy of the eConsent via 
email or text message stating, “Because URMC can’t control the security of email or text messages once 
we send them, we need your permission to text or email you. Do you want to receive a copy of the consent 
document and a link to  the eConsent via text or email?”  Verbal permission from the patient will be 
documented. We will  email or text the eConsent in the form of a pdf document and set up a phone call or 
Zoom meeting (participant’s choice) to formally go over the consent document. In a separate email  or text , 
we will provide  a link to the eConsent document as well as instru ctions on how to access the eConsent —
we will use verification with a passcode based on known information (e.g.,  the patient’s home zip code ). 
No personal health information  will be sent via any  email s/texts. The eConsent documents may be viewed 
on computer s, electronic tablets, or smartphones. The pdf copy of the eConsent and the REDCap eConsent 
will have identical information; it will be optional for the person to review the consent before the study 
team discusses it with them. After a member of the study team reviews the consent document with the 
participant  over the phone  or computer , they will have the opportunity to electronically sign the eConsent 
via REDCap . The person obtaining consent will initiate the eConsent process from within REDCap for their 
name [INVESTIGATOR_1238] a timestamp to appear on the study participant’s signed consent form . In order to authenticate 
that the person signing is that person, we will again use a passcode based on known information (e.g., the 
patient’s year of birth).  Once the eConsent fo rm is signed and submitted, the patient and/or legally

 authorized representative will be able to receive a print out of the paper copy, download a pdf, and/or 
receive an email with a PDF attachment of the signed consent form.   
 
7.3 The consent document  
The informed consent document will  provide consent for the entire  study, though consent may be 
withdrawn at any time. Because this study includes only one “phase,” we will not ask participants to re -
consent during the study. The consent form  will also contain information regarding HIPAA authorization , 
if participants consent to be contact[CONTACT_94092] , preferred method of contact (i.e., phone, 
text, email) .  
For individuals  who are eligible and who provide  informed consent, t he following information will 
be entered into a secure electronic database (e.g., Excel on a password -protected computer). This 
information is needed in case contact [CONTACT_239273]/or the participant requires payment 
through the mail .  
 Participant  ID number (used to identify the participant  on all study forms  and notes ) 
 Name  
 Participant  phone number  
 Participant home address  
 Participant  email address  
 Medical Record number  
 Date of informed consent  
 Date of registration  
 
If a person  requests to waive or alter elements of the informed consent document, they will not be 
allowed to participate in the study. A note will be made in the screening log as to why written consent was 
not obtained. Similarly, if a n individual  requests to waive documentation of consent, they will not be 
allowed to participate. Study staff  will reiterate  that the only record linking the participant  and the research 
would be the consent document and the principal risk would be potential harm resulting from a breach of 
confidentiality . If an individual  waives or alters HIPAA Authorization, the person  will also not be allowed 
to participate.  Study staf f will e xplain why the study cannot be conducted without the use or disclosure of 
protected health information (PHI) , and describe the plan to protect identifiers from improper use and 
disclosure . It will also be  explain ed that all forms will be held in a locked location for at least 6 years, and 
disposal of forms will occur in a confidential manner.  PHI will not be reused or disclosed to any other 
person or entity except (i) as required by [CONTACT_2371], (ii) for authorized oversight of the research study, or (iii) for 
other research for which the use or disclosure of PHI would be permitted by [CONTACT_36869].  
 
8. Study procedures  
8.1 Overview of study  
 This study is  a single -arm feasibility TRE  intervention for 14  days, during which participant s will 
be asked  to consume a ll of their calories within a 10 -h window. The primary goals are to assess  the 
feasibility of implementing the intervention and participant s’ adherence to the dietary pattern  over the 14 
days. Information on fatigue and quality of life  will al so be collected ; while large changes in these measures  
are not expected , it will be  ensure d that the diet pattern does not c ause large amounts of fatigue,  a large

 reduction in quality of life , or exacerbation of any chronic symptoms . It is hypothesized  that a longer 
duration intervention (e.g., at least 4 -12 weeks34) will re duce cancer -related fatigue and other symptoms.  
 
8.2 S tudy procedures, assessments, and participant  activities  
8.2.1 Screening procedures  
 Potential participant s will be screened for their duration into survivorship (needs to be 4  months –5 
years), age (nee ds to be ≥18 years old), and BMI (needs to be >20 kg/m2). Potential participants also need 
to be in the habit of consuming food within a window that is larger than 10 hours  and be experiencing 
fatigue ( a score of [ADDRESS_290326] week ). If there are any 
screen failures, we will retain the information in a screening log as described in §6.[ADDRESS_290327] contains height, weight, current menopausal status, Karnofsky Performance 
Status  or Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG ) Performance Status , comorbidities, cancer stage, 
surgical procedures, types and doses of treatments, and other clinical characteristics. The study team wil l 
use the medical record to complete as much of the Clinical Record  as possible.  The study team will also 
note all toxicity outcomes. All other questionnaires will be completed by [CONTACT_2299] .  
 
8.2.[ADDRESS_290328] by [CONTACT_239274] 
a signed consent form to each participant ’s medical record, for those participant s enrolled in the research 
study. No further research -related information will be included in the medical record.  
 The assessments will take place in one of two locations: 1) at the Wilmot Cancer Institute (including 
satellite locations)  and 2) at home or par ticipant’s choice. The consent will take place at the clinic  whenever 
possible , which co mprises the Wilmot Cancer Institute , Pluta Cancer Center, or a  Wilmot Cancer Institute -
affiliated clinic , or can alternatively be accomplished remotely . The questionnaires will be completed 
electronically or on paper  and can be completed at the clinic or a t home (or wherever is convenient). Body 
weight data will be collected  by [CONTACT_239275] a portable bathroom scale  that is 
provided by [CONTACT_3476] . Therefore, this entire  study can be completed remotely.

nature of the TRE  diet compared to the typi[INVESTIGATOR_239243] , there is a chance that patients 
could enter a calorie deficit and l ose weight during the course of the intervention.13 Minor  weight loss will 
not be considered an adverse event ( less than 3% in one week or 5% body weight in the 14  days). However, 
if a patient experiences rapid, unintentional weight loss, the participant will be encouraged to contact [CONTACT_239276] . The CTCAE , version 5,2 will be used to report weight 
loss as an adverse event:  
 Weight loss of 5% to less than 10% from baseline with no intervention indicated will be considered 
a Grade 1 adverse event.  
 Weight loss of 10 % to less than 20% from baseline and indicated nutritiona l support will be 
considered a Grade 2  adverse event . 
 Weight loss greater than or equal to 20% from baseline wi th indicated tube feeding or total parental 
nutrition (TPN)  will be considered a Grade 3 adverse event.  
In order to closely monitor weight chang e, each participant  will be provided with a scale to use at home. 
Due to the short nature of this intervention  (i.e., 2 weeks) , no adverse events due to weight loss  are 
anticipated . However, in the event that this occurs , the treatment team’s recommendations for nutritional 
interventions due to any weight loss  will be followed . 
 Weight loss can  cause anxiety in cancer  survivors who might think that their cancer is recurring . 
However, k nowing that this dietary intervention often  results in weigh t loss, particularly in  people who are  
overweight,17 can be reassuring in that weight loss is due to dietary change  and not a manif estation of 
progressive cancer, particularly if there a re no other concerning symptoms . 
As always, the patient has the right to eat or drink outside of the 10 -h window , and to withdraw 
from the study at any time.  
Probability : Moderate  probability that some weight loss will be experienced, especially in patients with 
excess body fat; very low probability that a dangerous amount of weight will be lost

earlier . If they delay breakfast , they might  feel hungry in the few hours leading up to their eating window, 
especially in the first few days of the study. Similarly, they might crav e something before bed if they are in 
the habit of eating before bed. With hunger can come lack o f concentration, fatigue, dizziness, irritability,

These  questionnaires contain information that might be distressing or private (e.g., “I am satisfied 
with family communication about my illness” from the  FACIT -F). Participant s will be reminded that they 
do not have to answer any questions they are not comfortable answering, and they can take a break or stop

9.1.4. Breach of confidentiality  
There is always a risk of a breach of confidentiality in which sensitive medical information could 
become known to persons outside the research team. To avoid leakage of sensitive information, only [CONTACT_239290] (the study ch air) and any individual designees  will have access to the screening log and the  file 
that links participant  name [CONTACT_239286]  (both will be encrypted) ; these  files will be stored on a 
password -protected computer in her private office in the Canc er Control Unit in Saunders Research 
Building.  All data files will reference participants by a non -identifiable Participant ID and will be stored on 
[CONTACT_239289]’s computer and secure servers at URMC. All consent forms will be stored in a locked cabinet 
also in her office. If [CONTACT_239289] shares data with any other researcher for analyses, all data will be 
deidentified (i.e., void of name , birthdate , and contact [CONTACT_3031] ). Presentation of data in the form of 
posters, presentations, grant applications, and manuscripts, either in private or public settings, will not have 
any identifiable information.  [CONTACT_239289] and all other co -investigators participate in ethical training in

individual research records will not be share d with their treating physician  unless they provide consent or 
the participant ’s treating physician is [CONTACT_239292] , in which case he will have access to study data 
as a study co -investigator. Overall study results may be presented to participants , faculty , and staff at 
URMC  after completion of the study. Study results will be prese nted at professional meetings, published, 
and reported on clinicaltrials.gov  ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ). 
All study data will be kept for at least six years after the study and all reports and publications are 
complete.

 15. Data/sample storage for future use  
 All dat a collected for the cur rent study will be used in post -hoc analyses as appropriate. These 
analyses could provide preliminary data for future studies. Data will be stored long -term as described in 
§14.4. Any individ ual who would like access to de identified raw data must submit a request to the study 
chair (i.e., [CONTACT_239293]) via a written request (e.g., email). If [CONTACT_239289] considers the project 
appropriate, she will approve a release of the data and transfer it in a safe, HIPAA -compliant manner  as 
described in §14.4 .  
 
16. Data analysis and monitoring  
 The James P. Wilmot Cancer Institute Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will serve as 
the DSMC of record for this study. The DSMC provides oversight of study progress and safety by [CONTACT_239284]. The frequency of review is determined by [CONTACT_239285], 
risk, and complexity of the trial.  
[CONTACT_239289], the study chair , will conduct continuous review of data and participant  safety. The 
Investigator will s ubmit annual  progress reports of these data to the DSMC  for review. The review will 
include the number of participant s enrolled, withdrawals, and adverse events ( both expected and 
unexpected ). A copy of the Adverse Event spreadsheet along with the Progress  Report will be submitted to 
the DSMC  for review. Actual review dates will be assigned when the first participant is accrued.  
Any adverse event that is serious, related, and unexpected will be reported within 10 calendar days 
to both the Safety Coordinato r (e.g., Sarah Strause) and the RSRB. The DSMC Chair will determine 
whether further action is required, and when participant  safety is of concern. When participant  safety is of 
concern, an interim meeting may be called.  
Serious adverse events that are rela ted and expected or unrelated and unexpected will be reported 
to the Committee for review at the quarterly meeting. Serious adverse event reports will include sufficient 
detail so that the DSMC can determine the severity, toxicity grade, expectedness, trea tment required, and a 
follow -up report documenting resolution of if there are sequelae. Serious adverse events that require 
detailed reports (but not necessarily expedited) are expected, related, non -hematologic toxicities of grade 
3, 4 or 5.  
 
17. Data an alysis plan  
17.1 Sample size determination  
 This is a single -arm feasibility pi[INVESTIGATOR_239246] a TRE intervention trial  and their adherence to the diet pattern for two weeks . The goal is to 
assess  feasibility of recruitment and retention so that these data can be used in a follow -on grant application 
in mid -2020; this larger study will be used to obtain preliminary efficacy data for TRE on cancer -related 
fatigue. It is common that single -arm pi[INVESTIGATOR_239247] 10 -40 
participants (e.g., TRE study among overweight older adults, n=10;36 ketogenic diet among patients with 
recurrent glioblastoma, n=20;[ADDRESS_290345] cancer 
survivors, n=1438). In total,  40 participant s will be recrui ted, and approximately  20% attrition  is anticipated , 
providing evaluable data from approximately  32 participants.

Version Date:  [ADDRESS_290346] 11 of the 14 days (79% of days) . This goal is based on prior TRE 
studies.17,21 A secondary aim is retention; it is hypothesized  that at least 80% ( 32 out of 40) of those who 
provide baseline data also provide post -intervention data; this goal is based on prio r studies conducted by  
[CONTACT_239256] . 
To ensure safety of this intervention, body weight will be monitored weekly from baseline to post -
intervention. It is anticipated that no one will lose more than  3% body weight in one week or 5% body 
weight  over the 14 days . 
In exploratory analyses, we will assess fatigue and well -being from the FACIT -F and BFI 
questionnaires , as well as general symptoms from the Symptom Inventory . The distribution of the outcome 
measures at baseline, at 14 days,  and th e change score (from baseline to 14 days ) will be first assessed 
visually (e.g. , histogram) and  then descriptive statistics [e.g., ra nge, interquartile range, mean (95% 
confidence interval), standard deviation]  will be evaluated . The m agnitude of the chan ge score together 
with variability and distribution data will be used to inform the sample size and design of our future study. 
A paired t -test will be used to formally  assess whether the change over time was different from zero with a 
two-tailed α of 0. 10. For a particular outcome measure, n=32 patients provides 80 % power to detect changes 
at the magnitude of 0.[ADDRESS_290347] URMC procedures . All 
data will be visually inspected. For exploratory measures, if distributional assumptions are not met (e.g., 
normality of residuals), transformations or nonparametric methods will be used. Outliers will be closely 
examined to determine if they are erroneous; if they are valid, sensitivity analyses (with and without 
outliers) will be used. Hy pothesis testing will use α=0.10 (two -tailed). The study team  will work closely 
with [CONTACT_239294] and her team (e.g., [CONTACT_239295] wen Xu, [CONTACT_239296]) —biostatisticians in the 
Division of Cancer Control.  
 
17.4 Missing data  
REDCap allows data entry forms to  facilitate completion of all measures.39 The reasons for missing 
data will be tabulated. Under the missing at random (MAR) assumption, multiple imputation will be used 
to obtain unbiased estimates of key statistics. If data ar e suspected to be missing not at random (MNAR), 
we will perform a sensitivity analysis using pattern mixture models.

Title of Project:  Sympathetic Reactivity to Water Restriction in Young and Old er Adults  
 
Principal Investigator (s): Joseph Watso, B S (PI); Willi am Farquhar, PhD (Advisor ) 
 
You are being invited to participate in a research study. This consent form tells you about the study including 
its purpose, what you will be asked to do  if you decide to take part, and the risks and benefits of being in the 
study. Please read the information below and ask us any questions you may have before you decide whether 
or not you want to participate.  
 
WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY?  
The purpose of this study is to look at the ef fects of reduced water intake on blood pressure responses to 
various tests. The body manages salt and water levels in the blood to maintain blood volume and blood 
pressure balance.  Not drinking enough water impairs how our body controls blood pressure. Th e purpose of 
this study is to assess how water intake affects the blood pressure during different tests in young and older 
adults. Hand grip exercise with arm cuff occlusion, the hand in cold water test, and a breath hold will be used. 
These tests will pro vide insight into how water intake status affects how your body controls your blood 
pressure.  
 
You will be one of about 80 people in this study (one of 40 young adults).  
 
WHY ARE YOU BEING ASKED  TO PARTICIPATE?  
You are being asked to participate because  you are between the ages of 20 -35 years old with a body mass 
index (ratio of height and weight) score between 18.[ADDRESS_1145931]  blood pressure within specific limits (systoli c 90-139 mmHg and  diastolic 
blood pressure 50 -89 mmHg) . You must also have no known heart  diseases, metabolic diseases, cancer, 
kidney disease, and/or other chronic diseases. In addition, individuals that are pregnant, plan on becoming 
pregnant, or currently recei ving hormone replacement therapy do not qualify.  
 
WHAT WILL YOU BE ASKED TO DO ?    
As part of t his study you will be asked to return  to the  STAR Campus, Newark, DE for up to [ADDRESS_1145932] being this consent visit. The total time commitment for this study is up to ~8 hours , including 
this consent visit.  
 
*If necessary. Seven -day physical activity monitoring may be done during washout period between visits 
three  and four .

       Participant’s Initials _________  Water intake  Protocols  
Three days prior to each study visit  you will be asked to  eat a recommended sodium diet (2,300 mg). You will 
be assigned to follow a normal water intake  and reduced water intake protocol f or each of the two study visits, 
in a random order . The table below indicates the fluid intake you will be asked to follow by [CONTACT_4475]. You will be 
asked to  drink 23mL water  per kg of body weight per day for the normal water intake state , and 10mL  water 
per kg body  weight per day for the reduc ed water intake protocol . Below is the intake plan for both.  
 Normal water intake  Reduced water intake  
Day 1  54oz  54oz  
Day 2  54oz  40oz  
Day 3  54oz  24oz  
Morning of Visit  8oz Avoid fluids  
   *Based on a 70kg  (154lb)  participant . This will be changed for you based on your body weight.  
 
Water and food will not be provided to you. You  will be given a water bottle with liquid measure mark s to 
drink the correct amount of water. You  will be shown  how to correctly maintain  a food log . You will be shown  
how to av oid high dietary sodium. You will also be given a list of foods that are high in water content to avoid 
[ADDRESS_1145933] will 
also be kept during the 3 days prior to each of the data collection visits. You  will also be asked  to avoid 
caffeine, alcohol, and moderate -to-vigorous (running, lifting weights, etc.) exercise 72 hours prior to  the data 
collection visits.  
 
Visit 1: Consent ing & screening (1 hour ) 
We will  explain the informed consent and answer any questions you may have.   
You w ill be screened at the Cardiovascular Core Laboratory at the University of Delaware. This involves 
complet ing a medical history questionnaire and physical activity readiness questio nnaire (PAR -Q), measuring 
resting blood press ure, height and weight. We will  review all of your information and if you are free from  
signs or symptoms of disease  will be a sked to participate  (example: history of chest pain, dizziness, or unusual 
shortness of breath, etc.) . If you answer “yes” to one or more questions on the PAR -Q we will review 
enrollment into this study on a case -by-case basis. For women , a urine pregnancy test wil l be administered to 
ensure you  are not pregnant. Those  currently taking hormonal contraceptives  are able to participate in the 
study. Additional exclusion criteria include: a history of cancer, diabetes, or any other chronic disease; a 
history of any heart disease; hormone therapy; use of tobacco or nicotine products; or a body mass index 
greater than or equal to 30kg/m2. In the event that one of the test results is abnormal o r a positive pregnancy 
test, you will be referred to you r personal physician.  
 
Visit 2: Hand grip practice & Equipment pi[INVESTIGATOR_9696] -up (30 min)  
You will practice a hand  grip exercise and post exercise arm cuff occlusion trial to simulate a data collection 
visit.  
 
You will be provided with a special backpack designed to carry the plastic urine container and blood pressure 
monitor.  The urine sampl e will be analyzed for salt content  and hormones that control salt and water balance.  
Some of these analyses will be done immediately in the lab, and some sample s will be stored in a freezer for 
future analysis. Your name [CONTACT_826189] e sample; rather, the sample will be coded with 
a number.

       Participant’s Initials _________  Visit 3 : Study visit (randomized water intake ) (3 hours)  
You will arrive to the Cardiovascular Physiology Laboratory (STAR Campus Lab 128) fasted 4 hours. You 
will hand in the equipment backpack.  
 
Urine Analysis  
Upon arrival to the laboratory, you will be asked to  provide  a spot urine sample . This will be used to analyze 
hydration status and check pregnancy for women.  
 
Catheter & Blood Sample  
A research nurse  or [CONTACT_826192] will place a catheter into your  dominant  arm. We will insert one catheter 
into the dominant arm, leaving a small flex ible tube in their vein. About 7.5 tablespoons (3.8  fluid oz.) will 
be sampled from the catheter . A blood sample  will be collected prior to hand  grip exercise, right after hand 
grip exercise during post exercise arm cuff occlusion, and after cuff deflation. The catheter will be removed 
at the end of each study visit.  
 
In the event our research nurse or [CONTACT_826192] are unavailable, a lab member trained in phleboto my will use 
a butterfly needle to collect a baseline blood sample. About 3.5 tablespoons (1.8 fluid oz.) will be sampled 
from the butterfly needle. The needle will be removed immediately after blood collection.  If this is the case, 
we will not sample blood  during post exercise arm cuff occlusion and after cuff deflation.  
 
Measurements - Blood Pressure, Heart Rate, Respi[INVESTIGATOR_826173]-dominant hand, on a beat  by [CONTACT_826177]. 
Additionally, brachial  blood pressure will be measured during the visit . We will place 4 sticky pad electrodes 
on your shoulders (2) and stomach (2) to measure heart rate. Breathing frequency will be measured by [CONTACT_826178] 
a band around your  lower chest. An ultrasound probe will be used to measure blood flowing in your upper leg 
(femoral artery). We will be measuring  beat by [CONTACT_826179], heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], and  blood flow 
continuously  throughout the visit . 
 
Microneurography  
To assess  sympathetic responses during exercise, we will record nerv ous system  
activity at the peroneal nerve using the technique of microneurography. The 
peroneal nerve runs on the outside of your lower limb, near the fibular bone. The 
microelectrode will be inserted through the skin just below the knee. A reference 
microelectrode will also be inserted into the skin above the placement of the main  
electrode. The insertion point will be determined by [CONTACT_826180]. When the nerve has been 
located, the electrode will be used to record nerve activity. The fine wire electrode 
will be removed following each st udy visit. [CONTACT_826193], [CONTACT_826194] n 
Wenner, or [CONTACT_826195]  will be performing th is technique.  
 
Tests of Sympathetic Reactivity  
 
Hand grip  Exercise Trials  
You will be asked to perform  hand grip  exercise . This will  last 2 minutes at approximately 30% & 40% of 
your maximal hand  grip strength.  Maximal hand  grip strength of the dominant hand will be measured by 
[CONTACT_826181].  The highest value will be used as 
Figure 1: Example of fine 
wire electrode.

       Participant’s Initials _________  the maximum, and this will be used to calculate relative work rates . In our experience, most participants 
perceived work rate during the hand grip  exercise tends to be “moderate” to “moderately hard.” During the 
last 3 seconds of exercise, a cuff on your  upper dominant arm will be inflated and will remain inflated for 3 
minutes and 15s. The cuff will be deflat ed and data collection will continue during recovery for 2 minutes. 
During hand  grip exercise, you will be encouraged to stay relaxed and to breathe normally, so as to  not 
dislodge the fine wire electrode from the nerve recording site. Dislodging the fine wire electrode does not 
pose any risk to you, but it does prevent us from obtaining a good  nerve recording. We will also use the Borg 
rating of perceived exertion (RPE ) scale to determine how hard you perceive you are working. Using the Borg 
scale, you will report an RPE between [ADDRESS_1145934]  
A small bucket will be filled with a slurry ice and water mixture. Your dominant hand will be submerged in 
the cold water for 2 minutes and data collection will continue during recovery for an additional 2 minutes.  
 
Breath Hold  
You will be asked to exhale all of the air from their lungs, then be asked  to hold your breath for a s long as 
you can (typi[INVESTIGATOR_160130] 30s). After you can no longer hold your breath, you  will resume normal breathing.  
 
You may leave the first experimental visit with an activity monitor  (like a Fitbit) to monitor daily physical 
activity over a seven -day period before the second three -day hydration protocol. Alternatively, you will leave 
with an activity monitor  after the second experimental visit and return for a brief (≤5 minutes) visit  to return 
the activity monitor .  
 
Visit 4 : Equipment pi[INVESTIGATOR_9696] -up (15min)  
You will be asked to pi[INVESTIGATOR_9696]-up the equipment backpack (plastic urine container and blood pressure monitor).  
 
Visit 5 : Study visit (randomized water intake ) (3 hours)  
You will be asked to complete the other hydration protocol , explained above.  
 
Visit 6: Activity Monitor Drop -off: 
If necessary, you will return the activity monitor following a seven -day physical activity monitoring period.  
 
WHAT ARE THE POSSIBLE RISKS AND DISCOMF ORTS?  
There are no known risks associated with obtaining your height, weight, resting ECG, resting blood pressure, 
urine collection or using ultrasound to measure blood flow.  
 
Water intake  Protocol  
There are some risks when you  are asked to limit water intake during the reduced water intake protocol. 
During the reduced water intake you may develop a dry mouth, develop thirst, become tired, develop a 
headache, develop constipation, or become dizzy or light headed. This protocol i s designed to induce mild 
dehydration . We have strategies to prevent more  severe dehydration. First, you will not be exercising prior to  
the water intake reduction , therefore activity will not add to the symptoms . Second, you can  swish water in 
your mouth and spit it out as needed to reduce thirst. If you do begin to feel the more severe symptoms  (severe 
headache, e xtreme thirst, very dry mouth) you can  consume 8oz of water and if symptoms are n ot resolved 
within 30 minutes, you can  consume another 8 oz of water. We anticipate quick relief  of any symptoms after

       Participant’s Initials _________  you drink  8oz of water, however if symptoms are present after [ADDRESS_1145935] the investigators 
and if needed seek medical attention.  
 
Blood Pressure Monitor  & Urine Collection  
You may have minor discomfort when the ambulatory blood  pressure cuff is inflated (you  may feel numbness 
and tingling in your arm and hand). Due to potential difficulty faced by [CONTACT_31267] , a urine funnel  collection tool 
will be given to you  to assist with urine collection. The ambulatory blood pressure cuff may cause you to 
wake up during the night . This is limited by [CONTACT_826182] 30 minutes as opposed to the 
daytime readings occurring every 20 minutes.  
 
Catheter & Blood Sample  
You may have pain a nd/or bruising at the spot where blood is taken or where the IV is placed in the arm . 
During reduced water intake  there is a risk for increased discomfort . There is a small risk of infection that will 
be minimized by [CONTACT_826183], single -use IV’s.  Signs of infection include pain, swelling, and redness.  If these 
signs occur, you should contact [CONTACT_30967].  Fainting sometimes occurs during or  shortly after 
blood is drawn however you will be laying down supi[INVESTIGATOR_826174].

Microneurography  
Our lab has been using this technique for over 15  years without any major complications. Mild external 
electri cal stimuli will be applied to your  lower leg; this may cause some discomfort. There may also be mild 
discomfort when the small needle is inserted through the skin; however, this needle is very small. Brief feeling 
of pi[INVESTIGATOR_42119]/or crampi[INVESTIGATOR_3501] l ikely to be felt during the nerve search  portion of this technique. It 
is also possible that feelings of muscle weakness and/or pi[INVESTIGATOR_826176]. 
There is no specific treatment for these feeling , and in the very smal l number of volunteer s that have felt them 
(<5% of participants in our la boratory), they  have disappeared naturally. The risks of side effects are lessened  
when no more than 1 hour is used to locate the peroneal nerve with the small needle. There is also a  small risk 
of infection at the site where the fine wire needle is inserted. We sterilize each needle and only use it once. 
The fine wire needle will be removed at the end of each study visit.  
 
Physical Activity Monitor  
There are no known risks for undergoing daily physical activity monitoring.  
 
Tests of Sympathetic Reactivity

Hand in Cold Water Test  
The hand in cold water test can cause discomfort. If the hand in cold water test becomes too un comfortable, 
we can remove your  hand from the cold water at your request. There is a risk of excessive blood pressure 
increase and heart arrhythmias. We will monitor blood pressure and heart rate.  
 
Breath  Hold  
You may feel slight discomfort while holding your breath. You also may feel dizziness right after the test.

 1. PROTOCOL  SYNOPSIS  
Protocol Title  Genetic testing to Understand and Address Renal Disease Disparities across the 
[LOCATION_002] (GUARDD -US) 
Product/Intervention Immediate versus delayed return of Apolipoprotein L1 ( APOL1 ) gene testing 
results to provider and participant.  
Objectives:  The primary aim is to determine the effect of participant and provider knowledge of 
a positive APOL1 status on change in systolic blood pressure (SBP) from baseline 
to 3 months after randomization. Secondary aims are to:  
1. Determine the effect of participant  and provider knowledge of a positive 
APOL1  status on the probability of documented chronic kidney disease 
(CKD) diagnosis.  
2. Determine the effect of participant and provider knowledge of a positive 
APOL1  status on the probability of receiving a urine test f or CKD.  
3. Explore cost effectiveness, mediators, moderators, psychobehavioral impact of results disclosure on participants, and effects of knowledge of 
APOL1  status on provider treatment recommendations.  
 
PGx Substudy:   
GUARDD- US will include a substudy  to determine the effect of knowledge of genetic 
test results that predict efficacy of various antihypertensive medications on change 
in SBP from baseline to 3 months in APOL1  negative individuals.  
Study Design Study Design:  
GUARDD- US is a prospective, mu lticenter, unblinded, two arm randomized 
pragmatic clinical trial. Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to immediate 
APOL1  gene testing and return of results (ROR) to participant and provider 
(Intervention arm) versus delayed APOL1  gene testing and ROR to participant and 
provider (Control arm). The main study will compare outcomes between APOL1  
positive participants in the Intervention arm (i.e., early knowledge of APOL1  status) 
to APOL1  positive participants in the Control arm (i.e., delayed knowledge of APOL1  
status). Participants that are APOL1  negative in the Intervention and Control groups 
will not be included in the main study analyses.    
 Pharmacogenetic (PGx) Substudy Design:  
GUARDD- US will also include a substudy that randomizes participa nts in the 
Intervention arm who are from the PGx substudy participating sites and who test 
negative for APOL1 to PGx Intervention (i.e., immediate PGx ROR) and PGx Control 
(i.e., delayed PGx ROR) in a 1:1 ratio. This substudy  will compare outcomes 
between participants in the PGx Control group and the PGx Intervention group.  
Rationale for Study 
Design  High-risk variants in the APOL1  gene explain approximately 70% of the excess 
prevalence of CKD in African Americans (AAs), conferring a [ADDRESS_511786]. A recent pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] (GUARDD), showed that returning APOL1  gene test results had a statistically 
significant improvement in SBP at 3 months when comparing APOL1  positives to 
APOL1  negatives who received their genetic testing results and when comparing 
APOL1  positives that received their results early to overall controls who did not 
receive their results until after the 3 month visit. GUARDD was not however powered to evaluate the effects of having and knowing a positive APOL1  status on 
outcomes for those with high risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_405855] (i.e., comparing outcomes for 
 
17 
 APOL1  positi ve patients who know their genetic risk to APOL1  positive patients 
who do not know their genetic risk). A broader trial is needed to better determine 
the importance of APOL1  gene testing for improving the testing, diagnosis, and 
treatment of individuals at  risk of CKD.  
 
PGx Substudy:  
New data show that genetic differences may cause patients to respond differently antihypertensive medication therapy, particularly in AAs. Pharmacogenomics may help guide initial or add- on antihypertensive therapy management. However, the 
impact of PGx testing on BP has not been studied in clinical trials among general or AA populations.  
 
Study Population  Randomized Population : 
Approximately 6, 750 participants of African ancestry age 18- 70 with hypertension 
that either: 1) do not have diabetes and do not have CKD, or 2) have CKD (with or 
without diabetes).  
 
Population for Main Study : 
Participants from Randomized Population (above) who test positive for APOL1  
 Population for PGx Substudy:  
Participants from Randomized Population (above) randomized to Intervention and who test negative for APOL1 . Only participants from PGx substudy participating 
sites are included in this population.  
Number of 
Recruitment Sites  ~46-60 
Duration of 
Participation  ~6 months for study visits, up to 12 months for EHR data retrieval  
Description of implementation of 
intervention (e.g., 
dose, schedule, etc.)  The primary intervention for GUARDD -US is the immediate return of APOL1  genetic 
testing results to participants and participant providers. Return of APOL1  genetic 
testing results to participants and providers will occur as described in Section 7.6. In addition to verbal ROR, participants will also receive lay explanations in writing and an educational booklet explaining their results and genetic risks. Providers will 
be notified of participant results via standard site- specific laboratory return of results 
methods and, where possible, a clinical decision support system (CDS) within the 
electronic health system as described in Section 7.8. Providers may also receive links for accessing provider and participant educational materials through the CDS 
or other means. Finally, all participants are given the option to discuss their results 
with a genetic counselor.  
 
The intervention for the PGx substudy is the immediate return of PGx testing results 
to participants via phone and/or in- person , return of results and alerts via standard 
site-specific laboratory return of results methods and a CDS within the electronic 
health system for providers, and educational materials for both patients and 
providers regarding the genes tested and phenotypes associated with the effi cacy 
of hypertension medications.

 Primary Endpoint  Change in Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) from baseline to 3 months  for APOL1  
positive participants.  
Secondary 
Endpoints  The secondary endpoints for the main study include:  
● Change in urine microalbuminuria/proteinuria orders from baseline to 6 
months (Y/N)

The major endpoint  for the PGx substudy is the change in systolic blood pressure 
from baseline to the 3 month study visit .  
 
Statistical Analyses Main Study Analyses : 
● To determine the effect of participant and provider knowledge of a positive 
APOL1  status on SBP, we will compare the change in SBP from baseline 
to 3 months of the Intervention – APOL1  positive group to the change in 
SBP from baseline to [ADDRESS_511790], as appropriate, with an overall  two-sided type I 
error of 0.05.  
● The effect of knowledge of a positive APOL1  status on all secondary 
endpoints will be compared between Intervention - APOL1  positives to 
Control - APOL1  positives with the proportion difference test.  
● Additional analyses will include analysis of time trends in SBP, subset 
analyses, and exploratory analyses of cost effec tiveness, mediators, 
moderators, psychobehavioral impact of results disclosure on participants, 
and effects of knowledge of APOL1  status on provider treatment 
recommendations.  
 
Substudy Analyses : 
● Major  primary endpoint analyses conducted for the APOL1  main study will 
be repeated for the PGx substudy focusing on differences in outcomes 
between APOL1  negative individuals with immediate PGx ROR (PGx 
Intervention) and APOL1  negative individuals with delayed PGx ROR (PGx 
Control).

2.1 Background, Significance, and Rationale  
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with hypertension and diabetes and affects 26 million US adults.1 
African Americans (AA’s) have higher risk of end stage renal disease (ESRD) necessitating maintenance dialy sis 
or transplant than Whites.[ADDRESS_511791] 
prevalence of hypertension (41% AA, 28% White) and the lowest rate of blood pressure (BP) control (43% AA 
versus 53% White).3 While improv ed BP control decreases CKD progression and reduces morbidity and mortality, 
BP control (defined as < 140/90 mm Hg4-7) is only achieved in 50% of participants.8  
 One in 7 AAs carry the Apolipoprotein L1 ( APOL1)  gene risk allele, but it is nearly absent in other populations. 
High-risk variants in the APOL1  explain approximately 70% of the excess prevalence of CKD in AAs, conferring 
a [ADDRESS_511792].
9 This risk is conferred by [CONTACT_405878] (G1 and/or G2) in the last exon of APOL1 with the high- risk genotype being G1/G1; G2/G2 or G1/G2.[ADDRESS_511793] regardless of diabetes diagnosis.11 Among adults with CKD, specific medications 
(angiotensin- converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)) are recommended for 
participants of all ancestries, but 50% of participants do not receive these medications. Compounding this issue is the fact that providers do not include CKD on the problem list of 40% of participants with lab evidence of CKD,
12 
leading to widespread participant unawareness of CKD. Urine protein tests, essential for early diagnosis and prognosis of CKD, are missing in up to 30% of participants with CKD.
13  
 In Genetic Testing to Understand Renal Disease Disparities (GUARDD), investigators randomized participants 
to immediate (Intervention) versus delayed (Control) APOL1 testing. Results were returned to participants 
through culturally appropriate clinical coordinators trained by [CONTACT_405879], and to providers through low -
intensity clinical decision support (CDS) (including best practice alerts (BPAs) with the test results and links to 
more provider information, participant education, and a generic message about the importance of blood pressure 
control). The study included a narrower phenotype of participants, excluding those with CKD or diabetes. 
GUARDD showed a statistically significant reduction in SBP at 3 months when comparing: 1) APOL1  positives 
and negatives in the Intervention group ( -6±18 mm Hg vs -3±18 mm Hg, p=0.008 cross -sectional at 3 months ), 
and 2) Intervention APOL1  positives versus overall Controls ( -6±18 mmHg vs -3±18 mmHg, p=0.04 cross -
sectional at 3 months).  GUARDD also showed a trend towards a higher proportion of participants receiving renal disease testing at 12 months, as captured through electronic health records, when comparing: 1) APOL1  positives 
and negatives in the Intervention group (29% vs 24%, p=0.10 cross -sectional at 12 months), and 2) Intervention 
APOL1  positives versus overall  Controls ( 29% vs 20%, p=0.01 cross -sectional 12 months ). Participants self -
reported making lifestyle changes and taking more blood pressure medicines in response to positive versus negative APOL1  results. In addition, over 95% of participants were satisfied with the type, timing, and amount of 
information they received. Although participants were offered the option to speak with or meet with a genetic counselor, none chose to do so. Using stakeholder -engaged processes, there was an 11% rate of refusal, 93%  
3-month retention rate, and 88% 12- month retention rate.  
 Several new developments highlight the importance of a broader pragmatic clinical trial (PCT). The GUARDD study was not powered to compare those with high risk genotypes ( APOL1  positives) in the Intervention group to 
APOL1  positives in the Control group. New evidence since the study’s inception also allows investigators to make 
CDS tools more robust, which may lead to greater action on the part of providers to improve hypertensi on 
management and renal disease screening. Finally, new data show that genetic differences affect the response to antihypertensive medication therapy, particularly in AAs. While pharmacogenetic (PGx) testing may help guide 
 
[ADDRESS_511794] of participant and provider knowledge of a positive APOL1  status  and 
accompanying guideline based clinical decision support (CDS)  on blood pressure management  on change in 
systolic blood pressure (SBP) from baseline to 3 months after randomization among the APOL1 positive 
participants. Secondary aims are to:  
1. Determine the effect of participant and provider knowledge of a positive APOL1  status on the probability 
of documen ted CKD diagnosis.  
2. Determine the effect of participant and provider knowledge of a positive APOL1  status on the probability 
of receiving a urine microalbumin/creatinine testing and ACE-I/ARB  prescription based on results of the 
urine microalbumin level.  
3. Explore cost effectiveness, mediators, moderators, psychobehavioral impact of results disclosure on 
participants, and effects of participant and provider knowledge of  APOL1  status on provider treatment 
recommendations.  
 
In addition, GUARDD -US will include a substudy to determine the effect of knowledge of genetic test results that 
predict efficacy of various antihypertensive medications on change in SBP from baseline to 3 months in APOL1  
negative individuals.

 3. ENDPOINTS  
3.1 Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoint is the change in systolic blood pressure from baseline to the 3 month study visit  in APOL1  
positive participants .  
3.2 Secondary Endpoints  
Secondary endpoints include:  
 
1. Change in urine microalbuminuria/proteinuria orders from baseline to 6 months (Y/N)  
2. Documented order of microalbuminuria/proteinuria tests by 6 months (Y/N)  
3. Change in documented diagnosis for stage 3 CKD and above from baseline to 6 months (Y/N)  
4. Documented diagnosis of CKD stage 3 and above by 6 months (Y/N)  
5. Change in documented diagnosis for any stage CKD from baseline to 6 months (Y/N)  
6. Documented diagnosis of all stages of CKD by 6 months (Y/N)   
 
Please see Section 10.2 for the derivations of these endpoints.  
3.3 Pharmacogenetic (PGx) Substudy Endpoints  
The major endpoint for the PGx substudy is the change in systolic blood pressure from baseline to the 3 month 
study visit .  
 
Additional exploratory endpoints and analyses for the PGx substudy will be described in a separate Statistical 
Analysis Plan (SAP).  
 
23 4. STUDY DESIGN
4.1 Study Arms & Design
This is a prospective, multicenter, unblinded, two arm, randomized pragmatic clinical trial (PCT) ( Figure  1). 
Participants will be recruited from several recruitment sites (hereafter referred to as site) and randomized in a 1:1 
ratio to immediate APOL1 gene testing and return of results (ROR) to participant and provider (Intervention arm) 
versus delayed APOL1 gene testing and ROR to participant and provider (Control arm). The main study will 
compare outcomes in a subset of the randomized population: APOL1 positive participants in the Intervention arm 
(i.e., early knowledge of APOL1 status) versus APOL1 positive participants in the Control arm (i.e., delayed 
knowledge of APOL1 status) (red outline in Figure 1 ). Participants that are APOL1 negative in the Intervention 
and Control groups will not be included in the main study analyses.   
Figure 1.GUARDD- US study design for sites participating in PGx.
The primary outcome of the main study is systolic blood pressure (SBP) at 3 months in Control -APOL1 positive and 
Intervention- APOL1 positive participants (red outline). The substudy outcome is SBP at 3 months in Intervention- APOL1

24 Negative PGX Control and PGx Intervention participants (orange outline). AA = African Americans. APOL1 = Apolipoprotein 
L1. HTN = hypertension. PGx = Pharmacogenetics. ROR = Return of Results.  
GUARDD- US will also include a substudy that randomizes participants in the Intervention arm who test negative 
for APOL1 to PGx Intervention (i.e., immediate PGx ROR) and PGx Control (i.e., delayed PGx ROR) in a 1:1 
ratio. Only participants from the PGx substudy participating sites are included in this substudy. This substudy will 
compare outcomes between participants in the PGx Control group and the PGx Intervention group (orange outline 
in Figure 1 ). 
The study design for sites that are not participating in the PGx substudy is summarized in Figure 2.
  Figure 2.GUARDD- US study design for sites not participating in PGx. 
The primary outcome of the main study is systolic blood pressure (SBP) at 3 months in Control -APOL1 positive and 
Intervention- APOL1 positive participants (red outline). AA = African Americans. APOL1 = Apolipoprotein L1. HTN = 
hypertension. ROR = Return of Results.  
4.2 Randomization
Eligible participants will be randomized in a 1:1 allocation to Intervention (i.e., immediate APOL1 gene testing 
and ROR to participant and provider) and Control arms (delayed APOL1 gene testing and ROR to participant and 
provider). Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_405880] a random block size within site.   

 
25 
 Participants that are randomized to receive immediate APOL1  ROR will simultaneously be randomized to the 
PGx substudy intervention (i.e., immediate PGx gene testing and ROR to participant and provider) or the PGx 
control (delayed PGx gene testing and ROR to participant and provider) using a 1:[ADDRESS_511795] positive for APOL1  will be excluded from the substudy and receive delayed PGx gene testing and ROR.  
4.3 Blinding  
GUARDD- US randomization assignments will not be blinded to any participants, providers or study personnel 
because: 1) it is impossible to mask participants from the intervention testing and ROR, 2) research staff often 
receive questions from participants about the interpretation and risk associated with the participant’s genetic results during the administration of surveys, and 3) resource limitations make hiring additional blinded staff to 
measure blood pressure impractical. To minimize bias in the measurement of the primary outcome, 
randomization assignments will only be revealed after baseline survey responses and blood pressure readings have been collected, digital blood pressure devices (such as Professional Intellisense Blood Pressure Monitor OMRON- 907
14) will be used to measure blood pressure, and blood pressure will be measured as the mean of 
the second and third blood pressure readings for each participant at each visit.  Manual blood pressures may be 
collected if necessary.  
4.4 Sample Size  
Main Study:   GUARDD -U S will randomize approximately 6750 individuals with approximately 3375 individuals in 
the Control Arm and 3375 in the Intervention arm. Assuming a 14% prevalence of APOL1  positive individuals, a 
sample size of [ADDRESS_511796] a 3.5 mm Hg difference in the change 
in SBP between baseline and 3 months between Intervention - APOL1  positive and Control - APOL1  positive 
groups with 80% power. Since APOL1 result data and SBP  change data could be missing for various reasons , 
an approximately  50 individuals will be randomized in addition to the 6700 sample size. Therefore, the total 
randomization target is approximately 6750.  Please see Section 9.1 for assumptions, clinical significance, and 
detailed power and sample size calculations.  
 PGx Substudy : Of 
 the approximately 6750 participants in the GUARDD -US study, approximatel y 4400 will also 
be at a site participat ing in the PGx substudy. A sample size of 4400 with a 14% prevalence of APOL1 positive 
individuals would result in 1892 participants for the PGx substudy (Intervention – APOL1  negative participants) 
with [ADDRESS_511797] a 3.1 mm Hg 
difference in the change in SBP from baseline to 3 months between the PGx Intervention group and PGx Control group with approximately 90% power. Please see Section 9.1 Sample Size Determination for assumptions, 
clinical significance, and detailed power and sample size calculations.

 6. RECRUITMENT  AND  ENROLLMENT  PROCEDURES  
6.1 Provider Recruitment, Assent, and Consent  
Providers (including physicians, nurse practitioners, and provider assistants) that care for participants with 
hypertension (including, for example, general internists, family doctors/nurses, and nephrologists): 1) should be 
notified that their patients will be contact[CONTACT_150884], per site- specific institutional guidelines, and 
2) may be asked to participate in a baseline provider survey. Provider assent may be obtained as required per 
institutional guidelines. Site/clinical champi[INVESTIGATOR_405858]- US staff may present the study to providers at 
scheduled meetings and also in one- on-one encounters or email at various recruitment sites. Provider survey 
responses should be recorded in the study database. Study staff may send reminders to providers to increase 
survey completion rates.  
6.[ADDRESS_511802] (EHR) Data Queries for Eligible Participants  
Sites may query EHRs to identify potentially eligible participants using the inclusion/exclusion criteria (see the 
manual of operations (MOP) for further details) .  
 
Participant Recruitment  
Participants may be approached for the study in various ways following local policies and procedures  including, 
for example, recruitment letters mailed directly to patients, clinic intercepts, study flyers, clinic referrals, or directly 
in clinic during a regularly scheduled clinic appointment.  Participant recruitment letters may be created according 
to site-specific institutional policies, including, for example, instructions for how to opt out of study participation.  
Research Coordinators can also approach potentially eligible patients at clinic appointments. Research Coordinators may also provide clinical staff with study referral cards with eligibility criteria and study contact [CONTACT_405881]. Clinics may have posters, flyers, and advertisements on TV monitors in waiting 
rooms with a study description and Research Coordinator contact [CONTACT_3031]. If a patient expresses interest in 
participating, Research Coordinators may  use a recruitment script (provided in the MOP) to do an initial screen 
for eligibility and then schedule the baseline visit in the future or that same day. Study sta ff may also ask current 
participants if they know anyone who would qualify for the study and provide them with study -related contact 
[CONTACT_405882] .
 
 Stakeholder Group and Additional Recruitment Materials  
Diverse groups of stakeholders consisting of patient advocates, clinicians and community leaders will be engaged 
throughout the study process. These will include the Sinai Genomics Board, the Implementing Genomics in 
Practice Pragmatic Trials Network (IGNITE PTN) Patient, Provider, and Payer Advisory Board, and where available, stakeholders from sites. They may meet regularly to review all patient facing materials, including 
consent forms and patient recruitment and educational materials (recruitment letter s, scripts, flyers, posters, etc.), 
for clarity and content. They may also provide input on recruitment strategies, addressing study design and 
challenges.  
6.3 Screening Procedures  
Research Coordinators may use a recruitment script (provided in the MOP) during recruitment phone calls or 
clinic intercepts (described above) to inform the potential participant about the study and screen participants for eligibility using the study inclusion/exclusion criteria. If the participant is eligible and interested, a baseline visit should be scheduled in the future or that same day.  Screening may also be performed in a location agreed upon 
between a potential participant and the research team . 
 
[ADDRESS_511803] the opportunity to ask questions before 
providing written consent. Research Coordinators will provide the participant with a signed copy  or version of the 
consent document. An original signed consent form is maintained by [CONTACT_405883]. If the individual chooses not to sign the consent form, the Research Coordinator will inform him/her 
they are unable to participate in the study.  The consenting process can also be remote, via phone or electronically 
if approved by [CONTACT_3488].  A participant can complete the baseline visit and be randomized into the study 
within [ADDRESS_511804] their data collected as part of this study stored and shared for future related research, according to site- specific  institutional policies.  
 
6.5 Participant Discontinuation/Withdrawal from the Study  
Participants may stop participating or withdraw from the study at any point in time. All information and data 
collected from the participant up to that point can be used in the study. Withdrawal of consent to participate in the 
research study can be verbal or in writing, however, revocation of HIPAA authorization must be in writing. 
Research Coordinators should attempt to obtain a reason for withdrawal from the participant and record it in the 
study database.  
6.[ADDRESS_511805] to Follow -Up 
Losses to follow -up may be minimized and retention maximized through various mechanisms, including offering 
study visits during evening and weekend hours, collecting information for and contact[CONTACT_405884], approaching research participants at clinic appointments, and completing surveys over-the-phone (although research participant should still attend study visits for blood pressure measurement). 
Certified letters may also be sent to those not reached by [CONTACT_648]. Research Coordinators should confirm the best 
contact [CONTACT_405885]. Research Coordinators may also obtain permission to contact [CONTACT_405886]. P articipants 
may be assigned to a specific Research Coordinator at the site in order to maintain continuity and build rapport.  
6.[ADDRESS_511806] results will be 
 
30 
 discussed with the participant at the time of ROR. If systolic blood pressure exceeds 190 mm Hg or diastolic 
exce eds 110 mm Hg during any study visit, the participant will be strongly advised to seek urgent and appropriate 
evaluation and care from a healthcare provider. The Research Coordinator may facilitate this by [CONTACT_405887], urgent care, or clinic staff on site including the Principal 
Investigator (if study visit is taking place in a clinical setting).   
 
Delay in Learning Test Results  
There is a risk that some patients in the Control group will have a [ADDRESS_511807] (GINA), generally makes it illegal for health insurance 
companies, group health plans, and most employers to discriminate against participants based on their genetic 
information, federal law does not protect patients against genetic discrimination by [CONTACT_405888], disability insurance, or long- term care insurance.  
6.[ADDRESS_511808] benefit to participant health.  
6.9 Costs to the Participants  
Taking part in this research study may lead to minor added costs including, for example, transportation to attend 
study visits.  
6.10 Compensation to Participants  
Research participants will receive compensation throughout the course of the study for their time and effort. They 
will receive compensation for completion of each study visit – baseline, 3- month follow up, and 6- month follow 
up. Compensation may also be provided, on a pro- rated basis, for survey completion over the phone. Participants 
may be reimbursed for travel and/or parking expenses per institutional specific policies.

 7. STUDY  PROCEDURES  
This section provides an overview of the study procedures to be followed in GUARDD -US. Further details will be 
provided in a MOP. Sites will receive training on the protocol and MOP before beginning enrollment.  
7.1 Interventions/Treatments  
The intervention for  GUARDD- US is intended to reflect the practices and procedures that are likely to be 
implemented if APOL1  testing were to be integrated into standard clinical practice. It includes the following 
components for participants and providers:  
 
Participants  
● An educational booklet given to all participants at the baseline visit that includes information about high 
blood pressure, kidney disease, and APOL1  gene testing, and language recommending that participants 
speak with their provider if their BP is >130/80 mm Hg .  
● The results of participant blood pressure readings at each study visit including 
o the mean of the second and third blood pressure readings  
o an indication of whether the mean value is normal (<130/80 mm Hg), up to your provider  
(between 13 1/81 mm Hg and 140/90 mm Hg) or elevated (>140/90 mm Hg)  
o a recommendation to speak with a provider if the participant’s BP is above normal  
● The verbal return of APOL1  genetic testing results (i.e., APOL1  positive or negative)  and a verbal 
explanation of the meaning of the genetic testing results for risk of CKD and hypertension to participants  
following the schedule of activities and procedures for the participant’s APOL1 randomization 
assignment (see Section 7.10) . 
● A written  explanation of the clinical implications of the patient’s APOL1 genetic testing results given to 
participants at the time of ROR . 
● The same educational booklet will be given to participants as a reminder at the time of ROR .  
● The option for patients to speak  with a genetic counselor about their results .  
 
Providers  
● The electronic or written return of APOL1  genetic testing results (i.e., APOL1  positive or negative) to 
patient providers via standard site- specific laboratory return of results methods at approximately the 
same time or after participants have received their APOL1  genetic testing results . 
● Where possible, the electronic return of posit ive APOL1  gene testing results to providers via a CDS alert 
that includes the participant’s positive APOL1  status, the risks associated with the participant’s APOL1  
status, and treatment recommendations (including treatment for elevated BPs, ordering urine proteins 
tests, and ordering ACEs/ARBs) at approximately the same time or after participants have received their 
APOL1  genetic testing results (see Section 7.8 for details) . 
● Educational materials explaining APOL [ADDRESS_511809] received patient APOL1  genetic testing results . 
 During the baseline visit, all participants should receive an educational booklet with information about high blood 
pressure, kidney disease, and APOL1  gene testing. This document will be identical for all participants. 
Participants will be notified of their APOL1  randomization assignment after completing the baseline visit. At the 
end of each study visit  (i.e., baseline, 3 month, 6 month) , all participants will  also receive the results of their blood 
pressure readings  including the mean of the second and third blood pressure readings and an indication of 
whether this measurement is normal (<130/80 mm Hg), up to your provider  (between 131 /81 mm H g and 140/90 
mm Hg) or elevated  (>140/90 mm Hg).  Participants in the Control arm will receive their APOL1  genetic testing 
results and an explanation of the meaning of their genetic testing results for risk of CKD and hypertension by 
[CONTACT_17084]/or in-person after their 6 month study visit, while participants in the Intervention arm will receive their 
APOL1  genetic testing results  and an explanation of the meaning of their genetic testing results  via phone and/or 
 
[ADDRESS_511810] results in writing and the educational booklet at the time of ROR in case the 
education booklet given at baseline was misplaced. These documents will be sent via mail and/or secure email 
to participants after the study team has attempted to verbally notify the participant  of their test results. Written 
explanations of the test results and educational booklets will be identical for both Control and Intervention 
participants. In addition to study visits, participants may also have non- study related visits with their provider/s 
during the study. All participants may receive treatment recommendations or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_405859].  
 
Providers may be notified of participant results via standard site- specific laboratory return of results methods and, 
where possible and for positive APOL1  results, a CDS alert within the electronic health system, as described in 
Section 7.8. Providers may also receive electronic links for accessing provider and participant educational materials through the CDS or other means. Providers of participants in the Intervention arm may receive notifications of the participants APOL1 gene status during the study (via CDS alert or standard site- specific 
laboratory return of results methods). Providers of participants in the Control arm may be notified of participant 
APOL1 gene status after the participant’s 6 month study visit. Details of the ROR are presented in Section 7.6 
and the schedule of activities is presented in Section 7.10. Table  1 describes the APOL1  variants and their 
predicted CKD risk.

The intervention for the PGx substudy  is also intended to reflect the practices and procedures that are likely to 
be implemented if PGx testing were to be integrated into standard clinical practice. It includes the following 
components for participants and providers:  
 
Participants  
● An educational booklet explaining PGx testing and clinical implications for hypertension medication 
management given to participants at the baseline visit . 
● The return of PGx genetic testing results to participants following the schedule of activities and 
procedures for the participant’s PGx randomization assignment . 
● A written explanation of clinical implications of the patient’s PGx genetic testing results including the genes tested and phenotypes associated with the efficacy of hypertension medications given to 
participants at the time of ROR .
 
● An educational booklet given to participants at the time of ROR .  
 
Providers  
● The return of PGx genetic testing results to patient providers via standard site- specific laboratory return 
of results methods at approximately the same time or after participants have received their PGx testing results.
 
 
33 
 ● Where possible, a CDS provider alert  for actionable phenotypes when a relevant medication is or may 
be ordered that  indicates the participant’s genetic results, the predicted phenotype (i.e., efficacy of 
various hypertension medications), and treatment recommendations  at approximately the same time or 
after participants have received their PGx testing results . 
 
Tables [ADDRESS_511811] significant evidence supporting their 
relationship in populations that include individuals of African ancestry which is summarized in Appendix B .  
 Table 4  describes the PGx recommendations to be given for actionable genotypes. Each recommendation will 
be provided in the laboratory return of results and via a CDS alert, where available, that will be activated when a 
provider prescribes a medication that is not recommended based on the participant’s genotype. Please see section 7.6 for more details.

aDetailed references and rationale are summarized in Appendix B   
7.[ADDRESS_511812] (including mailing address, all phone numbers, and next of kin contact [CONTACT_3031]). Research Coordinators will administer 
a survey (approximately 30 minutes long) to obtain information regarding the demographics, comorbidities, 
psychosocial factors, and knowledge, attitudes and beliefs towards genomics, kidney disease and hypertension. Survey responses will be recorded by [CONTACT_405889] . A paper version of the survey can be used during a study visit , with survey data entered into the 
study database at a later time. Blood pressure will be measured according to the GUARDD -US Blood Pressure 
Protocol (details provided in the MOP)  using a digital blood pressure monitor (such as Professional Intellisense 
Blood Pressure Monitor, OMRON -907
14). Manual blood pressures may be collected if necessary. Pulse 
measurement will also be recorded for each participant  and a blood, saliva, or buccal cell sample will be collected 
(as described in Section 7.4). After completion of the baseline visit, the Research Coordinator will randomize participants to immediate or delayed APOL1  genetic testing and give patients: 1) an educational booklet with 
information about high blood pressure, kidney disease, and APOL1  gene testing, 2) the results of participant 
blood pressure readings including the mean of the second and third blood pressure readings and an indication 
of whether this measurement is normal (<130/80 mm Hg), up to provider (between 131/81 mm Hg and 140/90 
mm Hg) or elevated (>140/90 mm Hg), and 3) the participant’s randomization assignment.   
 During the baseline visit, if the third (3
rd) of three (3) consecutively measured blood pressure readings is greater 
than or equal to [ADDRESS_511813] the participant’s 
blood pressure according to GUARDD -US Blood Pressure Protocol (provided in the MOP)  and pulse 
measurement.  Participants will be compensated for each  study visit (see Section 6. 10). Whenever possible, 
participants will meet with the same Research Coordinator for follow -up visits to maintain continuity. Follow -up 
assessments at each visit will include only participant -reported surveys, blood pressure and pulse measurements. 
Follow -up surveys may also be administer ed over the phone. 
 If a study site has been unable to reach a participant for a follow up visit, a blood pressure measurement may be obtained from the EHR and recorded in the study database if it meets the following criteria: 1) the blood pressure 
was measured within the specified visit window for the missed projected visit date and 2) the visit was either a clinic visit or a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345].  Within the projected follow -up window , the blood pressure reading that was 
collected closest to the survey completion date will be used.   
 
During any follow -up visit, i f the third (3
rd) of three (3) consecutively measured blood pressure readings is  greater 
than or equ al to [ADDRESS_511814] 1 tube (approximately 1-2 teaspoons  or 5 
mLs) of blood via venipuncture from participants willing to give a blood sample.  Research Coordinators should 
follow the MOP for instructions regarding the collection, storage, and delivery of the genetic sample s to the  
designated laboratory.   
 
Saliva Protocol  
Alternatively, participants may provide a saliva sample in lieu of a blood sample. Research Coordinators should 
follow the MOP for instructions regarding the collection, storage, and delivery of the sample to the designated 
laboratory .  Patients giving a saliva sample should not eat, drink, smoke or chew gum for [ADDRESS_511815] confirmed that saliva samples are a viable alternative as a source of DNA for genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_4585]
15. 
 Buccal Cell Protocol  
Alternatively,  participants may provide a buccal cell sample in lieu of a blood or saliva sample. Sample collection 
swabs/brushes should be labeled by [CONTACT_405890], and collection, storage, and delivery to the designated laboratory 
 
[ADDRESS_511816] DNA after the Control participant has completed the 6 month follow -up assessment. Control Arm DNA samples will be processed as 
soon as possible after the 6 month visit using analytically validated procedures. Genes to be tested for the PGx substudy along with genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_405861] 7.1. Details of sample 
storage and transport will be presented in the MOP. All laboratories in GUARDD -US are Clinical Laboratory 
Improvement Amendments (CLIA) -certified for high complexity.  
7.6 Return of Genetic Results  
The designated laboratories will transfer participant genetic testing results to the IGNITE PTN Coordinating Center (CC) as soon as possible and follow standard site- specific procedures for return of results to providers. 
Genetic results will be imported into the study database and the site EHR, where available. The study database 
will notify study personnel  when a participant’s lab results are ready to be returned to the participant.  
 Participants will receive APOL1 and/or PGx results via phone and/or in- person. Research Coordinators should 
call participants at the appropriate time (see Figure 1  and Tables 5 -7), follow the ROR script (provided in the 
MOP), and end with a speak back in which participants will explain their results back in order to ensure 
comprehension. Research Coordinators should note the date, time, and completion status of all RORs in the 
study database. All participants will receive their genetic test results with lay explanations in writing and an educational booklet explaining their results and genetic risks via mail  and/or secure email . Research Coordinators 
will offer all participants the option to speak by [CONTACT_405891] a study genetic counselor about their results. If a participant wants to speak with a genetic counselor, the Research Coordinator should conta ct the 
genetic counselor for their site on behalf of the patient, and the genetic counselor should reach out to the patient 
for counseling.  
 Providers may be notified of participant results via standard site- specific laboratory return of results methods an d, 
where possible, a CDS within the electronic health system as described in Section 7.8. The genetic testing results should also be stored in the participant’s medical records.  
7.[ADDRESS_511817]  
Data from the local EHR will  be used to determine: 1) components of the secondary endpoints (i.e., presence of 
CKD diagnosis codes in the 24 months prior to baseline and up to 8 months after baseline, urine tests obtained 
in the 24 months prior to baseline and in the 6 months after baseline), 2) events of interest (see Section 8.2), and 3) variables needed for Other Planned Analyses including Cost Effectiveness Analysis (CEA) (se e Section 9.6). 
Sites will extract the relevant EHR data using prespecified algorithms developed centrally by [CONTACT_405892]- developed algorithms. If using the CC -developed algorithms, sites will modify the algorithm 
codes based on their own customized EHR system. Sites will be asked to conduct EHR data downloads  after at 
least 25% of the participants have completed their [ADDRESS_511818] results via a phone call  and/or in- person, providers 
may be notified of participant results via standard site- specific laboratory return of results methods and, where 
possible, a CDS within the electronic health system. For APOL1  testing, sites should work with their institutional 
informational technology departments to set up provider CDS alerts for positive APOL1 results and for actionable 
PGx phenotypes when a relevant medication is ordered. APOL1  alerts should include the part icipant’s APOL1  
status, the risks associated with the participant’s APOL1  status, and treatment recommendations (including 
treatment for elevated BPs, ordering urine proteins tests, and ordering ACEs/ARBs), and additional educational 
materials  delivered via the site- specific CDS implementation method. For PGx testing, provider alerts should 
indicate the participant’s genetic results, the predicted phenotype (i.e., efficacy of various hypertension 
medications), and treatment recommendations.  
 Refl
ecting the pragmatic nature of the trial, the many involved research sites, and variations in local CDS policies, 
it is anticipated that there will be differences in CDS implementation details, but all sites will ensure that both participants and providers are alerted to APOL1 and PGx test results and associated significance. Details of the 
alerts will be provided separately to relevant site personnel .

detailing the procedures to be followed. A Data and Safety Monitoring Plan and a separate DSMB statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be developed in collaboration with the IGNITE PTN, IGNITE PTN CC, and NHGRI, and enacted by [CONTACT_4318].

 9. STATISTICAL  ANALYSIS  PLAN  AND  SAMPLE  SIZE  
9.1 Sample Size Determination  
Main Study  
In GUARDD, there was a 13% prevalence of APOL1  positive individuals among hypertension participants and a 
standard deviation of 18.1 mm Hg for SBP. A separate unpublished pi[INVESTIGATOR_405863] a 
20% prevalence of APOL1  positive individuals among participants with CKD and an estimated CKD prevalence 
of 50%. Finally, another study showed a 26% prevalence of APOL1 positive AAs with CKD9. As such, the initial 
sample size determination assumed a 17% prevalence of APOL1  positive individuals. However, observation of 
the prevalence of the APOL1  positive study participants during the course of the study led investigators and the 
DSMB to believe that this assumption was too high and the actual prevalence in the study population was 
between 14 and 15 percent. Assuming a conservative 14% prevalence of APOL1  positive individuals based on 
these studies, a sample size of approximately [ADDRESS_511825] and assuming an overall  5% level of significance, 10% lost -to-follow up, two interim analys es, 
and a standard deviation of 18.[ADDRESS_511826] 80% power. This sample size determination assumes 10% of the [ADDRESS_511827] a 3.5 mm Hg 
difference between two treatment groups. Enrollment will continue until the 844 target  can be ensured.  Since  
APOL1 and SBP data could be missing for various reasons , approximately 50 additional participants will be 
randomized to help us to reach this 844 target . This ma kes the total randomization target to be approximately 
6750. Enrollment may end prior to the 6 750 target if the study team is certain  that the necessary 844 APOL1  
positive individuals  with complete SBP change data can be achieved . 
 
 
 PGx Substudy   
Of the approximately 6750 participants in the GUARDD -US study, approximately 4400 will also be at a site 
participat ing in the PGx substudy. A sample size of 4400 with a 14% prevalence of APOL1 positive individuals 
would result in 1892 participants for the PGx substudy (Intervention – APOL1  negative participants) with [ADDRESS_511828] and assuming a 5% level of 
significance, 10% lost -to-follow up,  and a standard deviation of 20 mm Hg (obtained from an unpublished study 
from the University of [LOCATION_012]), a sample size of [ADDRESS_511829] a 3.1 mm Hg difference in the change in SBP from baseline to 3 months between the PGx 
Intervention group and PGx Control group with approximately 90% power.  
  
 
[ADDRESS_511830] deviations, medians, and/or 25th, 75th 
percentiles for continuous variables, and as counts and percentages for categorical variables. Model assumptions 
will be examined prior to analysis and transformations implemented, if necessary, to more adequately meet the 
assumptions. Unless otherwise stated, hypotheses will be tested as two- sided with a significance level of 0.05.  
9.[ADDRESS_511831] of knowledge of a positive APOL1  status on SBP, we will compare the change in SBP 
from baseline to 3 months of the Intervention – APOL1  positive group to the change in SBP from baseline to [ADDRESS_511832] with a n overall  two-sided type I error of 
0.05. Participants that are APOL1  negative in both the Intervention and Control groups will not be included. This 
primary analysis will be conducted according to the principle of intention- to-treat (ITT) with participants 
analyzed and endpoints attributed according to the treatment arm to which the participants were randomized, 
regardless of subsequent crossover or post -randomization medical care within the pre- specified subset of 
APOL1  positive participants.  
9.[ADDRESS_511833] of knowledge of a positive APOL1  status on secondary endpoints [i.e., change in urine 
microalbuminuria/proteinuria orders from baseline to 6 months (Y/N), documented order of 
microalbuminuria/proteinuria tests by 6 months (Y/N), change in documented diagnosis for stage 3 CKD and 
above (Y/N) from baseline to 6 months, documented diagnosis of CKD stage 3 and above by 6 months (Y/N), 
change in documented diagnosis for any stage CKD from baseline to 6 months (Y/N), and documented  diagnosis 
of all stages of CKD by 6 months (Y/N) ] will be compared between Intervention - APOL1  positives and Control - 
APOL1  positives with the proportion difference test.  
9.6 Other  Planned Analyses 
Trends in SBP . In addi
 tion to the primary endpoint analysis described above, we will compare the time trends in 
SBP between Intervention – APOL1 positive individuals and Control – APOL1 positive individuals using a 
repeated measures mixed model. Since participants are randomized to Intervention and Control groups and not 
to the APOL1 positive subgroups within Intervention and Control groups, there could be important differences in 
baseline characteristics between the two groups. For this reason, we will conduct covariate- adjusted repeated 
measures mixed models that will account for differences in baseline characteristics that differ between the 
Intervention – APOL1  positive group and the Control – APOL1  positive group. Potential baseline co variates 
include baseline SBP, age, sex, and baseline CKD . We will select the appropriate covariance matrix (e.g., 
 
44 
 compound symmetry, autoregressive, unstructured, or other covariance structure) based on the data to account 
for repeated measures.  
 
CKD subs et. If the data provide evidence of an overall difference in the primary outcome (change in SBP from 
baseline to 3 months) between Intervention – APOL1  positive group and the Control – APOL1  positive groups, 
we will further examine whether the effect of knowledge of a positive APOL1  status on SBP differs among those 
with and without CKD. This subgroup analyses will involve testing for interactions between treatment arm and 
CKD using linear regression. Effect estimates will be carefully (conservatively) interpreted in conjunction with 
the formal interaction test. If the interaction is significant, we will test whether the time trends in effect of early versus delayed knowledge of a positive APOL1  status on SBP differs among Intervention – APOL1  positive 
group and the Control – APOL1  positive groups in those with CKD at baseline using a covariate- adjusted 
repeated measures mixed model. Potential covariates are the same as described above. We will select the appropriate covariance matrix (e.g., compound symmetry, autoregressive, unstructured, or other covariance structure) based on the data to account for repeated measures.  
 
Controlled versus Uncontrolled Blood Pressure Subset.  We w
 ill also examine whether the effect of knowledge 
of a positive APOL1  status on SBP differs among those whose blood pressure is well -controlled at baseline 
versus those whose blood pressure is not well -controlled at baseline. This subgroup analyses will involve 
testing for interactions between treatment arm and whether or not SBP is [ADDRESS_511834] estimates will be carefully (conservatively) interpreted in conjunction with the 
formal interaction test. As an additional subgroup analysis, we will similarly examine the effect of  knowledge of 
a positive APOL1 status on SBP between those on treatment for hypertension versus those not on treatment in the subset of participants with SBP [ADDRESS_511835]-Effectiveness (CE).  Co
 mplete details of the cost -effectiveness analysis (CEA) will be presented in a 
separate SAP  depending on the outcome of the main study . Briefly, two analyses will be conducted comparing 
economic  outcomes in Intervention – APOL1  positive and the Control – APOL1  positive groups. In the first, within -
trial cost analysis, [ADDRESS_511836] will be estimated per participant using estimates of intervention 
costs (obtained from Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) physician fee schedule17), medication 
costs (obtained from participant survey, EHR costs per cost center and/or total costs, VAFFS drug prices18, 
National Average Drug Acquisition Cost (NADAC) drug prices19, Medicare drug prices20), and downstream health 
care costs of inpatient, outpatient, and emergency department use (from participant survey, EHR costs per cost center and/or total costs, Medicare outpatient prospective payment system (PPS) for healthcare common procedure coding system (HCPCS)
21, cost -to-charge- ratio (CCR) for estimating inpatient costs from charges22). 
The analyses will be adjusted for baseline 3-month total costs and utility scores by [CONTACT_405895]. The 
second, long- term CE analysis , will use a microsimulation model with five health states (Well, Cardiovascular 
Disease (CVD), ESRD, CVD plus ESRD, and Death) for predicting CE outcomes over a 5-year, 10- year and 
lifetime horizon following U.S. recommendations23. The microsimulation model’s predictions of CVD, ESRD and 
competing mortality rates will be informed by [CONTACT_405896][INVESTIGATOR_405864] U.S. life tables. 
Specifically, we will use the Pooled Cohort Equations24 for modeling CVD and epi[INVESTIGATOR_405865]- term ESRD risk with the following risk factors as input parameters: participant demographics 
(age,  gender, and race) obtained from participant surveys; 6- month systolic blood pressure measurements ; 6-
month smoking status and preventive medication use (BP med) obtained from participant surveys; and 6- month 
diabetes status , eGFR, urine albumin to creatinine ratio, and blood cholesterol parameters obtained from the 
EHR.  The estimated event rates of CVD, ESRD and competing mortality will be modified using expected rate 
ratios of blood pressure lowering therapy estimated from difference in 6- month change of systolic blood pressure 
from baseline. Rate ratios will be based on published meta- analyses of trials on blood pressure lowering 
medication.  The microsimulation model will be used to estimate cumulative costs and QALYs as a function of life 
expectancy and simulated CVD and ESRD events for each trial participant. Long- term utility and cost penalties 
 
[ADDRESS_511837] will be based on the literature. Details of the procedures for 
obtaining EHR data and estimates from the EHR will be provided in the MOP and SAP.  
 
PGx Substudy. Analyses for the PGx substudy will compare outcomes between APOL1  negat i ve individuals 
with imme diate PGx ROR (PGx Intervention) and APOL1  negative individuals with delayed PGx ROR (PGx 
Control). A two sided t-test with a two -sided type I error of 0.[ADDRESS_511838] the appropriate covariance matrix (e.g., compound symmetry, autoregressive, unstructured, or other covariance structure) based on the 
data to account for r epeated measures. Additional exploratory endpoints and analyses for the PGx substudy 
will be described in a separate SAP.  
 
Detai
ls of these statistical analyses along with all other exploratory analyses (e.g., mediators, moderators and 
psychobehavioral impact of results disclosure on participant outcomes and provider treatment recommendations, and medication adherence) will be described in the study SAP.  
 
Long- Term Exploratory Outcomes:  
Research participants can consent for  long- term follow up of kidney function. We will use appropriate 
procedures (including secure linkage, honest broker procedures, etc.) to access several databases, including 
patient electronic medical records, or restricted databases such as USRDS ([LOCATION_002] Renal Data System) and CMS  to track kidney function measurements, blood pressure, medication usage and health outcomes 
related to kidney disease up to [ADDRESS_511839] of Social Determinants of Health:  
Data from participant surveys will be used to explore the impact of individual -level social determinants of health 
on primary, secondary, and exploratory study outcomes. Participant address will be used for linkage to publicly 
available data on community -level determinants of health (eg, Social CDC Vulnerability Index) . 
9.7 Interim Analyses 
  A single planned interim analysis was planned initially for this study . To account for repeated significance testing 
of the accumulating data, the group sequential method of Lan and DeMets will be used as a guide for interpreting 
this interim analysis.  Monitoring boundaries for the primary endpoint will be based on a two- sided symmetric 
Lan-DeMets spending function using O’Brien- Fleming type boundaries with an overall two- sided significance 
level of α=0.05. The O’Brien- Fleming approach requires large critical values early in the study but relaxes (i.e., 
decreases) the critical value as the trial progresses. The primary and interim analyses will compare S BP at 3 
months among APOL1 positive individuals in the Control arm to APOL1 positive individuals in the Intervention 
arm. Because APOL1  genotype (i.e., positive vs. negative) for participants in the Control arm is determined 
around the time of the [ADDRESS_511840] completed their 6 month study visit will be 
included in the interim analysis.  To account for the delays in receiving genetic testing results, the interim analysis 
will be targeted to occur when approximately 25% of the participants have completed their 6 month study visit. 
Using the O’Brien- Fleming type boundary at 25% information, if the analysis calculates a p- value that is less than 
0.[ZIP_CODE], stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_405866].  In order to maintain the overall significance level 
of 0.05, the final analysis of the primary endpoint will be considered significant for p- values less than 0.049975. 
 
 
46 
 If the interim analysis does not propose stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_34303] (p- value < 0.[ZIP_CODE] and the intervention has the 
larger reduction in SBP at 3 months), then the conditional power to detect a significant result at the end of the 
trial will be estimated. The conditional power will be presented to the DSMB to facilitate discussion of whether 
the trial should be stopped for futility.   
 
An additional interim analysis was performed per request by [CONTACT_405897], 2022.  In order to maintain the overall significance level of 0.05 after this second interim analysis, the definition of significant p- value for the final 
analysis is recalculated by [CONTACT_405898]- DeMets function with O’ Brien-Fleming type boundaries 
appropriately for the approximate percent information at which the interim analysis occur red. Due to the 
occurrence of this second interim  analysis, the final analysis of the primary endpoint will be considered significant 
if p-value is less than 0.0492.  
9.[ADDRESS_511841] one of the comparisons could be "significant" by [CONTACT_3364]. Adjusting for the effects of the repeated significance testing for the multiplicity of secondary endpoints would require that very small significance levels be used for every comparison. Therefore, rather than adjusting 
for multiple comparisons, statistical results (e.g., p values) will only be presented for the primary endpoint 
analysis. We will be conservative in the interpretation of secondary analyses and report only point estimates and 95% confidence intervals. We have also pre- specified the primary and secondary outcome variables to avoid 
over-interpretation of strictly exploratory comparisons.   
 
[ADDRESS_511842] 4 main data sources: data collected from participants (survey, blood pressure and pulse) 
and providers (survey), genetic testing results from designated laboratories, data from the EHR, and publicly 
available data for CEA analyses. Data from patients and providers should be entered directly into study database 
by [CONTACT_405899]. Site staff will receive training on the use of the study database. After staff are trained, they will receive a unique user identification and password to access data entry 
forms for their site. Access codes should not be shared and are non- transferable.  
 
Laboratories will transfer genetic testing results to the IGNITE PTN CC and follow standard site- specific return of 
results procedures for providers. The genotype and result (i.e., positive versus negative) for each participant will 
then be automatically imported to the participant’s study database record from laboratory produced output files. 
The accuracy of the automatic import of laboratory results will be verified by [CONTACT_380589] a subset of the study participants . 
 
Sites will extract the relevant data from their EHR (see Section 7.7) and transfer those data to the IGNITE PTN 
CC following procedures that will be specified. Briefly, sites will be given a list of information to extract for their GUARDD- US participants, a common format that data should be converted to, and procedures for secure file 
transfer to the CC. Transfers of data will occur after at least 25% of the participants have completed their [ADDRESS_511843] -effectiveness analyses (CEA) will be obtained via participant surveys administered at 
study visits, direct measurement at study visits (for blood pressure), via the EHR, and via publicly available data

M
issing values will be imputed.  
 
[ADDRESS_511845] data audits throughout the course of the trial. These audits are 
intended to identify data errors, protocol deviations, failure of standardization, missing data, or inconsistencies. 
Any out -of-range values and missing or inconsistent key variables are flagged and addressed/answered at the 
site in real tim e during the data entry process.  
 
All data will be transferred daily from the study database to SAS datasets and stored on the CC’s secure servers. 
The CC will periodically perform additional data quality checks in SAS. Clinical sites may also be given regular feedback directly to discuss issues identified by [CONTACT_380590].  
10.4 Study Close Out  
The end of the trial is defined as the end of participant follow -up in the trial. Upon completion of the study, the 
IGNITE PTN CC and/or their designee will notify the site of closeout. The CC and/or their designee will ensure that the Investigator’s regulatory files are up to date and complete, and that any outstanding issues from previous correspondences have been resolved. Other issues to be reviewed at the closeout include: discussing retention 
of study files, possibility of site audits, publication policy, and notifying the IRB of study closure.  
 
 
[ADDRESS_511846]/Ethics Committee Review  
This study will be initiated only after all required documentation has been reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_405901]. The investigator will provide the IGNITE PTN CC or 
their designee with the study approval documentation before the study may begin. The same is applicable for the implementation of changes introduced by [CONTACT_15635]. Where applicable, the investigator must also provide to the IGNITE PTN CC and/or their designee the following documentation:  
1. A copy of IRB annual re- approval of the protocol per current Title 21 CFR 312.66 regulations and 1997 
International Conference on Harmonization guidelines.  
2. IRB approval of revisions to the informed consent documents. Administrative changes (such as a change  
in address or phone number) must be sent to IRBs/Ethics Committees but do not require their approval.  
3. The investigator must submit periodic status reports to their Executive Committee as required, as well as notification of completion of the study and a final report where applicable.  
4. The investigator will provide the IGNITE PTN CC or their designee with documentation of all approvals.  
11.2 Use and Disclosure of Protected Health Information  
For clinical trial sites located in the [LOCATION_002], an Authorization for the use and disclosure of PHI under the HIPAA Privacy Rule [45 CFR § 164.102 et seq ] will be obtained from every trial participant prior to, or at the time 
of, enrollment. The investigator is responsible for obtaining participants’ authorizations and signatures, and for explaining the elements of the HIPAA Authorization form. HIPAA Authorization may either be a separate form or 
included in the study ICF, dependent upon local requirements.  
11.[ADDRESS_511847] that ensures the information 
can always be tracked back to the source data. For this purpose, a unique participant identification code (ID number) will be used that allows identification of all data reported for each participant. Participant information 
collected in this study and all records will be kept confidential.  
 
Clinical data will be entered into an internet data entry system provided by [CONTACT_122456]. The data system includes 
password protection and internal quality checks, such as automatic range checks to identify data that appear 
inconsistent, incomplete, or inaccurate. All data collection and storage devices will be password protected with 
a strong password and all sensitive research information on portable devices will be encrypted. Access to 
identifiable data will be limited to the study team . If it is necessary to  use portable devices for initial collection of 
identifiers, the data files will be encrypted and the identifiers moved to a secure system as soon as possible.  
The portable device(s) will be locked in a secure location when it is not in use.  
 11.[ADDRESS_511848] a Publications and Presentations Committee (PPC) with the primary responsibility for coordinating, monitoring, and reviewing all publications and presentations resulting from IGNITE PTN studies. In addition, the PPC will oversee the review, approval, and supervision of the secondary analyses and ancillary 
studies that are conducted within the Network. The goal of the PPC is to facilitate dissemination of the maximum amount of information from these studies in a scientifically sound and ethically responsible fashion in accordance with the unique nature of the IGNITE PTN mission. The IGNITE PTN CC will draft a PPC charter in collaboration with NHGRI, PPC, and the IGNITE PTN, which specifies the publication policies and procedures.  
 The sharing of datasets will be performed following standard operating procedures (SOPs) at the IGNITE PTN 
 
[ADDRESS_511849] be: 1) used solely for research purposes, 2) properly acknowledged in resulting publications, 3) kept confidential and inaccessible to third parties, and 4) destroyed or returned after analyses are completed. Additionally, users must 
agree not to use data to identify individual participants.  
 
 
 
[ADDRESS_511850] the life or physical well -being of a participant in an emergency. Such approval will be documented and 
maintained in study files. Prior approval is generally not expected in situations where unforeseen circums tances 
are beyond the Investigator’s control, (e.g., participant did not attend scheduled follow -up visit, blood sample lost 
by [CONTACT_13754], etc.); however, the event is still considered a deviation. Deviations will be reported to the IGNITE PTN CC and/or t heir designee regardless of whether medically justifiable, or taken to protect the participant in an 
emergency. Investigators will maintain documentation of the dates and reasons for each deviation from the 
protocol in compliance with the International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice guidelines.  
 
[ADDRESS_511851] is determined to be substantial and relevant, the member should resign from the DSMB.

 15.2  Appendix B. PGx Substudy Gene Description and Evidence  
 
Overview: The PGx sub- study will examine the efficacy of providing genetic information for two gene- drug 
pairs. The first gene- drug pair is YEATS4 and thiazide diuretic efficacy, impacting first -line 
antihypertensive therapy in African Americans. The second gene- drug pair is NAT2  and hydralazine. 
Hydralazine is not first line therapy, but is used in the treatment of resistant hypertension. GUARDD -US 
will include patients with both hypertension and resistant hypertension. Neither gene -drug pair is presently 
recommended by [CONTACT_405905], but both have significant evidence supporting their relationship in populations 
that include individuals of African ancestry. Given that 83% of the GUARDD -US intervention arm will be 
APOL1  negative, the inclusion of a HTN PGx sub- study  is an economical means of testing a second 
hypothesis.  
Most individuals with hypertension require [ADDRESS_511858] to other current PGx recommendations (e.g. 
antidepressants or opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]), antihypertensive agents are often not used in isolation. Thus, 
recommendations need to convey both dosing suggestions and/or relative efficacy to enable a provider 
to efficiently craft a regimen with fewer agents. This is  of even greater importance in individuals with 
resistant hypertension.  
  YEATS4 : 
Evidence: The first gene- drug pair is YEATS4 , predictive of thiazide efficacy in two independent cohorts. 
This gene- drug pair was associated with efficacy of thiazide diuretics (HCTZ) in the GERA and PEAR 
cohorts. It was discovered in a genome wide association of African American GERA patients (ST T urner) 
and later replicated in the PEAR cohort (JD Duarte). The SNP, rs7297610, is an expression quantitative locus of YEATS4 , as expression is associated with both genotype and thiazide therapy. Citations are 
provided below. Although both GERA and PEAR studied HCTZ, we have decided to relay 
recommendations as a class effect (including both HCTZ and chlorthalidone). The rationale for this 
decision include the following: 1) the mechanisms of action are the same, 2) GUARDD -US is a pragmatic 
trial and the inclusion of the class effect enhances future generalizability, and 3) GUARDD -US includes 
individuals with CKD in whom chlorthalidone will be preferentially used by [CONTACT_405906]. We recognize 
hydrochlorothiazide (6- 15 hours) and chlorthalidone (45- 60 hours) each have a very different half -life. 
Overall, we feel the advantages of studying both drugs outweigh the potential heterogeneity. Further, we also note that the YEATS4 SNP is an expression quantitative loci and is anticipated to have a greater 
pharmacodyna mic effect than pharmacokinetic effect.  
Effect size: The effect size of rs7297610 is large. The T allele confers reduced efficacy to thiazide 
diuretics, reducing change in SBP by 3.[ADDRESS_511859] a 13.1 mmHg reduction in SBP in response to HCTZ initiation.  
Frequency: The minor allele frequency is ideal for testing effect size. The minor allele frequency of the T allele is ~0.3 with a dominant model for reduced efficacy. This means that approximately ½ of individuals 
(9% TT and 42% CT) would be expected to have reduced efficacy and ½ of individuals (49% CC) would 
 
[ADDRESS_511860] increased/standard efficacy. Thus, ~[ADDRESS_511861] an actionable 
genotype.  
Recommendation: First line antihypertensive therapy for African Americans presently consists of either a calcium channel blocker or thiazide diuretic. Our recommendation focusses on selection of first line therapy. The PEAR study included HCTZ and atenolol. Beta- blockers are no longer first line 
antihypertensive therapy. Thus, although HCTZ was not directly compared to a CCB in the study, we still 
have evidence that the T allele reduces thiazide efficacy. Thus, we are recommending thiazide or CCB 
use as the first drug in those with a CC genotype, but only a CCB as first -line in those with a T allele. This 
recommendation is pragmatic and straightforward for clinicians. The GUARDD -US trial will help us to test 
the efficacy of this recommendation.  
Our recommendation does not include specific dosing recommendations for thiazide diuretics, only 
relative efficacy recommendations. The rationale for this decision is that there is limited dynamic range of thiazide efficacy (essentially 12.5 mg or 25 mg dosing) and in practice, many clinicians will begin therapy at [ADDRESS_511862] relationship.  
  
Goal (Drug Class)  Gene  Genotype  Recommendation  
First Line Therapy  
(Thiazide diuretic)  YEATS4  C/C This individual is predicted to have standard thiazide 
efficacy. Consider use of a thiazide diuretic or calcium 
channel blocker as first line treatment of hypertension.  
First Line Therapy  
(Thiazide diuretic)  YEATS4  TT or TC  This individual is predicted to have reduced thiazide 
efficacy. Consider use of an alternate first line therapy such 
as a calcium channel blocker for treatment of hypertension.  
Resistant Hypertension  
(Hydralazine)  NAT2  *4/*X  This individuals  is predicted to have reduced hydralazine 
efficacy and may require a higher starting dose or an 
alternate agent such as clonidine, spi[INVESTIGATOR_8407], or 
doxazosin for resistant hypertension.  
Resistant Hypertension  
(Hydralazine)  NAT2  2 non -*[ADDRESS_511863] increased efficacy of 
hydralazine.  
NAT2  Evidence:  
Evidence: The second gene- drug pair selected was NAT2  and hydralazine. Hydralazine is metabolized 
by [CONTACT_140177]2 , so poor metabolizers have increased circulating concentrations of hydralazine. In this situation, 
poor metabolizers and slow acetylators terms are synonymous. This relationship was first reported nearly 
 
78 
 50 years ago. PharmGKB presently lists hydralzine- NAT2 as a level 3 recommendation, but there is only 
1 reference cited in PharmGKB. There is actually a preponderance of evidence (21 references) supporting 
the relationship between: 1) metabolizer status to hydralazine PK or blood pressure effect, 2) Metabolizer 
status to genotype, or 3) genotype directly to blood pressure effect. We also identified 3 negative studies, but in each there were limitations (underpowered or included multiple drugs which confounded the effect). Please see the references below. In  summary, the level of evidence for this drug- gene pair could 
potentially support a future CPIC recommendation. NAT2  metabolism is also listed in the FDA drug label 
for hydralazine. The evidence includes data in African ancestry populations and the stronge st effect is 
seen in slow acetylators/poor metabolizers. Based on evidence, it is possible that there is an intermediate phenotype, but the evidence is insufficient to distinguish blood pressure effects in rapid and intermediate 
acetylators.  
Effect size: T he effect size of the acetylator phenotype is large. Poor metabolizers may require a dose 
adjustment of 40% to >100% based on metabolizer status. There is a wide dose prescribing range for 
hydralazine from 10 mg BID to 100 mg TID.  
Frequency: The allele frequency is ideal for testing effect size. In the African American population, 35% are intermediate (1 non- *4 allele) and ~50% are slow acetylators (possessing 2 non -*4 alleles). Thus, ~[ADDRESS_511864] an actionable genotype.  
Recommendation: Based on the multitude of studies, we are r elaying a climinical implication that poor 
metabolizers may have higher circulating concentrations with increased efficacy or risk for adverse effects. N ormal/rapid metabolizers may require a higher dose of hydralazine or an alternate agent as 
compared to poor metabolizers (slow acetylators)  to achieve equivalent blood pressure control .

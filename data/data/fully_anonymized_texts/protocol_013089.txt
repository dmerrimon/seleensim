Version date: [ADDRESS_378472] 2017 Confidential Page 8 Drug Dosage  
and Formulation  Background Regimen :  Every subject must have been 
receiving background mono therapy with one PAH -approved 
oral therapy for at least [ADDRESS_378473] discontinue 
their background PAH oral therapy for any reason (e.g. AE), 
they must be switched to another agent  within the same class 
of medication, if available  and clinically appropriate  per the 
Investigator ’s discretion.  If no alternative therapy in the same 
class of medicatio n is available  and appropriate , the subject 
should  be switched to  a different class of approved oral PAH 
therapy.  
The minimum dose of oral PAH therapy used during the study 
must comply with the approved prescribing information for 
the product.  
Experimental Regimen :  All subjects will receive oral 
treprostinil (UT -15C) sustained release tablets or ma tching 
placebo.  Study drug may  be provided in 0.125, 0.25,  0.5, 1, 
and 2.5  mg sustained -release tablets to be administered three 
times (TID) daily.  The first dose of study drug (0.125 mg) 
should be taken by [CONTACT_37326] t he study site  within 
10 minutes of consuming food.  Oral dosing of study drug 
will then continue  at 0.125 mg TID (every 6  to 8 hours) with 
food.  Dose escalations can occur no more than every 
24 hours ( three  consecu tive doses) in 0.[ADDRESS_378474] four weeks of the study.  Following 
4 weeks of treatment, dose escalation may occur no more than 
every 24 hours in either 0.125 mg or 0.25  mg increments  TID.  
The maximum dose allowed will be  12 mg TID.  Note that 
sudden dose escalations or reductions may lead to intolerable 
adverse effects  or worsening of PAH , respectively,  and 
gradual dose titrations are recommended to reduce the risk to 
subjects .  Placebo will be identical in size, shape, and color to 
the respective active tablets.

1.1 DEFINITION OF CLINICAL PROBLEM 
Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), defined as an elevation in pulmonary arterial pressure 
and pulmonary vascular resistance, is a severe hemodynamic abnormality common to a 
variety of diseases and syndromes.  Elevation in pulmonary arterial pressure causes an 
increase in right ventricular afterload, impairing right ventricular function and ultimately 
leading to heart failure and death. 
The typi[INVESTIGATOR_308726], heritable or associated with collagen 
vascular/connective tissue disease, portal hypertension, infection with the human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), history of cocaine inhalation and exposure to appetite 
suppre
ssant drugs.  An estimated annual incidence of approximately 2 cases per million has 
been reported for idiopathic PAH [Rich, 1987; Rubin 1997]. 
There are three major factors thought to contribute to the increased pulmonary vascular 
resistance seen in this disease: vasoconstriction, remodeling of the vessel wall, and 
thrombosis.  There are a number of metabolic pathways which contribute to these changes 
that involve vasoactive mediators such as the vasodilators nitric oxide and prostacyclin 
(PGI 2), and the vasoconstrictor endothelin-1.  These substances affect both vascular tone and 
remodeling leading to their use as pharmacologic targets [Farber, 2004]. 
Approved pharmacotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_308727]: (1) intravenous PGI 2 (epoprostenol sodium or 
F
lolan®, Veletri®) ; (2) the PGI 2 analogues subcutaneous (SC), intravenous (IV), and inhaled 
treprostinil (Remodulin®, Tyvaso®) , oral treprostinil diethanolamine (also referred to as 
treprostinil diolamine; Orenitram®), oral selexipag (Uptravi®), and inhaled iloprost 
(Ventavis®); (3) the phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (PDE5- I), tadalafil (Adcirca®) and 
sildenafil (Revatio®); (4) the oral endothelin receptor antagonists (ERA), bosentan 
(Tracleer®), ambrisentan (Letairis®, Volibris®), and macitentan (Opsumit®), and (5) a soluble 
guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulator, riociguat (Adempas®). 
Approval of current PAH-specific pharmacotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_308728] 
6MWT.  The 6MWT is an assessment of exercise capacity and remains a standard measure of 
United Therapeutics Corporation TDE- PH-310 Amendment 8 
 Oral Treprostinil 
Version date: [ADDRESS_378489] 2017 Confidential Page 16 efficacy for trials of investigational medicines in subjects with PAH.  However, recent 
literature has questioned the clinical relevance, variability, and sensitivity of the 6MWT as a 
primary endpoint to assess the efficacy of treatments for PAH.  Although the 6MWT is still 
view
ed as a valuable tool for measuring clinical efficacy of PAH therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], a composite 
endpoint of ‘time to clinical worsening ’ is emerging as an alternative endpoint that allows for 
a
ssessment of long-term efficacy of investigational drugs for PAH [McLaughlin, 2009]. 
1.2
 TREPROSTINIL DIETHANOLAMINE BACKGROUND 
1.2.1 General Pharmacology 
Treprostinil, [[(1R,2R,3aS,9aS) 2,3,3a,4,9,9a hexahydro 2 hydroxy 1 [(3S) 3 hydroxyoctyl] 
1H benz [f]inden 5 yl]oxy]acetic acid, is a chemically stable tricyclic analogue of PGI 2. 
The pharmacology of treprostinil has been extensively characterized in well-established 
models, all confirming the suitability of the drug for the treatment of PAH following either 
the SC
, IV, inhaled (as treprostinil sodium) or oral (as treprostinil diethanolamine) routes of 
administration. 
The major pharmacological actions of treprostinil are direct vasodilation of pulmonary and 
systemic arterial vascular beds and inhibition of platelet aggregation.  In vitro, treprostinil 
induced concentration dependent relaxation of rabbit isolated precontracted mesenteric 
arteries, and inhibition of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) induced platelet aggregation in 
human and rat platelet rich plasma.  In animals, the vasodilatory effects of treprostinil reduce 
right and left ventricular afterload, thereby [CONTACT_3774].  
Prostacyclins lower pulmonary artery pressure, increase cardiac output without affecting the 
heart rate, improve systemic oxygen transport as well as possibly reversing pulmonary artery 
remodeling.  There is also increasing evidence that the ability to block the proliferation of 
pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells may contribute, along with vasodilation, to the 
therapeutic effects of PGI 2 in the treatment of PAH.  The mechanism of action is therefore 
li
kely to be multifactorial. 
Treprostinil diethanolamine (UT-15C) was selected from a series of treprostinil salts based on 
critical physicochemical characteristics (e.g., solubility, hygroscopi[INVESTIGATOR_36879], melting point) with a 
United Therapeutics Corporation TDE- PH-310 Amendment 8 
 Oral Treprostinil 
Version date: [ADDRESS_378490] 2017 Confidential Page 17 goal of delivering treprostinil by [CONTACT_308753] a sustained release (SR) dosage form. 
In solution, both treprostinil sodium and treprostinil diethanolamine are disassociated from 
their
 respective salt counter-ions and exist as the freely ionized form of treprostinil. As a 
result, the bioactive form present in the bloodstream is identical irrespective of the selection 
of the counter-ion. 
A r
at blood pressure model study confirmed that the diethanolamine salt of treprostinil 
exhibits dose dependent pharmacological activity with a cardiovascular profile comparable to 
that of treprostinil.  Overall, no highly active metabolite has been identified, as all the 
metabolites evaluated had greatly reduced activity compared to UT-15C.  Thus, it would 
appear that the observed pharmacological profile of UT-15C reflects the activity of the parent 
molecule, treprostinil, and that the contribution to that profile of any known metabolite that 
would be formed in vivo would be minimal. 
1.2.2 General Toxicology 
UT-15C is a novel salt form of Remodulin® (treprostinil) Injection and Tyvaso® (treprostinil) 
I
nhalation Solution, which are approved in the [LOCATION_002] and other countries for the 
treatment of patients with PAH. The active pharmaceutical ingredient, treprostinil, exists as 
the sodium salt in the drug product of Remodulin and Tyvaso. Given that the only change to 
the drug substance synthesis route for UT-15C is the diethanolamine addition step, and 
treprostinil is not altered, the bioactive form of treprostinil diethanolamine and treprostinil 
sodium is predicted to be identical.  Therefore, in addition to the nonclinical studies 
conducted with UT-15C, an extensive amount of pharmacology, pharmacokinetic, and 
toxicology information on treprostinil sodium is available from Remodulin and Tyvaso 
development. 
During the development of Remodulin, treprostinil sodium was administered SC and/or IV in 
acute toxicity studies, repeat-dose toxicity studies, reproductive toxicity studies, and 
genotoxicity studies, and has a well-defined clinical safety profile.  Treprostinil sodium was 
administered via continuous infusion to both rats and dogs in toxicity studies for up to 
6 months, which supported the chronic administration of Remodulin to patients.  
United Therapeutics Corporation TDE- PH-310 Amendment 8 
 Oral Treprostinil 
Version date: [ADDRESS_378491] included dose 
dependent, yet transient decreases in mean body weight gain and food consumption in both 
rats and dogs and sof t/mucoid stools, diarrhea, and vomitus in dogs.  Many of these findings 
have been seen previously during development of Remodulin and are consistent with PGI 2-
induced effects.  In addition, post-mortem findings in rats administered UT-15C included 
changes in organ weight data and histological findings related to the adrenal gland, heart, 
spleen, thymus and bone marrow; some of which were not seen with Remodulin.  The 
majority of these findings were reversible following a 4-week recovery period.  Data from a 
9-month dog study provides additional toxicology information following chronic dosing.  
UT-
15C was reasonably well-tolerated following daily oral administration at dose levels up to 
35 mg/dog/day for [ADDRESS_378492] not been conducted; however, data are 
available for such studies using high doses of Remodulin (treprostinil sodium).  Remodulin 
(treprostinil sodium) was non-mutagenic in bacterial reverse mutation assays (Ames assay) at 
concentrations up to 5000 mcg/plate with and without S9 metabolic activation, and in the 
mous
e lymphoma assay at concentrations up to 400 mcg/mL without S9 metabolic activation 
and up to 300 mcg/mL in the presence of S9. 
UT-15C was tested in vivo in the rat micronucleus assay, which aimed to evaluate the 
potential of
 UT-15C to increase the incidence of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes 
in bone marrow of rats.  The results of the assay indicated that oral administration of UT-15C 
United Therapeutics Corporation TDE- PH-310 Amendment 8 
 Oral Treprostinil 
Version date: [ADDRESS_378493] 2017 Confidential Page 19 at total doses up to and including a dose of 50 mg treprostinil (equivalent to 63.4 mg 
UT-15C/kg) did not induce a significant increase in the incidence of micronucleated 
polychromatic erythrocytes in either male or female SD rats.  Mortality observed at the high 
dose indicates systemic exposure of animals to the test article.  Based upon these findings, 
tre
prostinil diethanolamine (UT-15C) was concluded to be negative in the rat micronucleus 
assay. 
Segment I (rat) and Segment II (rat and rabbit) reproductive and developmental toxicology 
studies have also been conducted. No adverse effects for fetal viability/growth and fetal 
development (teratogenicity) were seen in rats at or below 20 mg/kg/day or rabbits at or 
below 0.5 mg/kg/day.  At high doses, there were teratogenic effects of UT-15C observed 
when administered to rabbits.  Findings included increased fetal incidence of external, soft 
ti
ssue, and skeletal malformations.  Additionally, a Segment III reproductive and 
de
velopmental toxicology study has been conducted in female rats.  F0 female rats receiving 
10 mg/kg/day had decreased food consumption and body weights during gestation, increased 
dura
tion of gestation, had slight decreases in the viability and number of pups per litter, and 
pups with decreased mean neonatal body weights.  F1 pups of females that received 
20 mg/kg/day had abnormalities in physical development (developmental landmarks), reflex 
de
velopment, exploratory behavior, learning and memory, and sexual maturation. 
A six month carcinogenicity study in hemizygous Tg.rasH2 mice administered UT-15C at

 Oral Treprostinil 
Version date: [ADDRESS_378495] 2017 Confidential Page 20 administration of diethanolamine for twenty weeks and two years, respectively, was not 
associated with the development of any cancers.  The relevance of the mouse tumor findings 
to humans is currently unknown.  Diethanolamine is listed on the FDA database of inactive 
ing
redients for a number of approved drug products with no apparent safety concerns. 
A Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) cardiovascular safety pharmacology study 
(Study 1259DU16.003) to evaluate diethanolamine effects, independent of treprostinil, on 
cardiovascular function in telemetered dogs was conducted.  Since there are 0.269 grams of 
diethanolamine per each gram of treprostinil in UT-15C, for this study, doses of 
diethanolamine were selected that were similar or higher than the amount of diethanolamine 
contained in the doses of UT-15C assessed in the UT-15C cardiovascular safety 
pharmacology study (Study 1259DU16.002).  Doses of 0, 2, 3, and 4 mg/kg/day of 
diethanolamine (equivalent to the amount of diethanolamine administered with 7, 11, and 
15 mg/kg/day of treprostinil, the free acid of UT-15C), were selected to be administered to 
e
ach of one group of four telemetered male dogs.  Data support that oral administration of 
diethanolamine at doses up to 2 mg/kg/dose twice daily (BID; 4 mg/kg/day) to male beagle 
dog
s was not associated with any definitive changes in arterial pressure, heart rate or 
electrocardiogram parameters.  In addition, no abnormal clinical signs were noted in the 
animals dosed with the vehicle or with any of the doses of diethanolamine.

has not been associated with any significant changes in laboratory parameters or end-organ

exposure
 is approximately seven years.  
The absolute bioavailability of the UT-15C 1 mg tablet is 17% compared with IV Remodulin.  
F
ollowing administration, treprostinil diethanolamine is widely distributed.  Treprostinil is 
approximately 96% protein bound with no effect on warfarin or digoxin displacement.  
P
harmacokinetic data (area under the curve; AUC) indicate that Day 1 pharmacokinetic data 
are predictive of Day 13 and linearity was observed in plasma exposure comparing 1 mg and 
2 mg doses in healthy volunteers.  Food, particularly a high calorie meal, has been observed to 
incr
ease absorption and prolong the systemic  exposure to treprostinil, contributing to the 
desired pharmacokinetic profile.  Consistent with  in vitro  studies, clinical studies assessing 
the impac
t of induction and inhibition of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C8 and CYP 2C9 
metabolic pathways on treprostinil diethanolamine indicate that CYP 2C8 appears to be of 
major importance and CYP 2C9 of minor importance to in vivo metabolism of UT-15C in 
humans.
 
To date, the majority of UT-15C studies have been conducted with BID dosing.  In an attempt 
to understand the pharmacokinetics of TID dosing a study was conducted in healthy 
volunteers.  In this open-label, single-center study 19 healthy subjects received 0.5 mg TID 
for
 7 days.  On the morning of Day 1 subjects received a single 0.5 mg dose, on Days 2 to 7 
the subjects received TID dosing of 0.5 mg (approximately 8AM, 2PM, and 8PM) with a 
meal.  On the morning of Day 8, the subjects received a final dose of 0.5 mg.

Version date: [ADDRESS_378504] 2017 Confidential Page 24 TDE- PH-301 was a 16-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, international 
Phase 3 efficacy and safety study of treprostinil diethanolamine (UT-15C), in patients with 
P
AH.  Patients received UT-15C or placebo BID in combination with an ERA, a PDE5- I, or 
both. 
 The primary endpoint was placebo-corrected change in 6MWD from Baseline to 
W
eek 16.  Secondary endpoints included Borg dyspnea score, dyspnea-fatigue index, WHO 
F
unctional Class, and time to clinical worsening.  Study drug dose was titrated up to a 
maximum of 16 mg BID based on clinical response and study drug tolerability. 
Three-hundred fifty-four subjects were enrolled with 30% receiving an ERA alone, 25% a 
PDE5-I alone, and 45% both agents.  The population was 81% female, predominantly WHO 
F
unctional Class III (76%), and had a mean baseline 6MWD of 346 m.  PAH etiology 
included idiopathic or heritable PAH (66%), or PAH associated with CTD (26%), repaired 
c
ongenital systemic- to-pulmonary shunt (7%), or HIV infection (1%).  There were no 
remarkable demographic differences between treatment groups. 
Twenty-two percent of subjects discontinued UT-15C therapy compared to 14% in the 
placebo group.  The primary reason for discontinuation was AEs : 14%  in the UT-15C group 
compared to 5% in placebo.  There were three deaths in each of the treatment groups. 
The Hodges-Lehmann (H-L) estimate of 6MWD placebo corrected median change from 
baseline at Week 16 was +11 m (p=0.072). The change in 6MWD was significant at Week 12 
(
+13 m, p=0.015).  The lack of significance at Week 16 may be attributable to the number of 
subj
ects who did not provide an efficacy measure at Week 16 due to discontinuing from the 
stud
y prematurely. 
Secondary endpoints of the combined 6MWD and Borg dyspnea score and the dyspnea-
fatigue index demonstrated statistically significant changes at Week 16 for UT- 15C compared 
to Baseline (p=0.013 and 0.01, respectively).

randomization had a lower discontinuation rate due to AEs (0%, n=23) as well as a higher 
H-L estimate of 6MWD treatment effect (+28.5 m) at Week 16.  Presumably titrating up the

subjects were in WHO Functional Class II (33%) and class III (66%) of varied etiologies, 
including idiopathic or heritable PAH (75%), CVD associated PAH (19%), and PAH 
associated with HIV or other associated conditions (6%).  The subjects ’ mean Baseline 
6MWD was approximately 330 m. 
The
 primary efficacy analysis comparing change in 6MWD from Baseline to Week 12 
between treatment groups in the primary analysis population (n=228) was +23 m (p=0.0125,

in the placebo group.

Week 12 did not differ significantly between the UT- 15C and placebo groups (p>0.05). 
An analysis of all [ADDRESS_378511] s 
re
ceiving UT-15C improved their median 6MWD by [CONTACT_3450] +25.5 m (H - L estimate, 
p=0.0001) as compared to subjects receiving placebo. 
AEs during the study included headache, nausea, diarrhea, and flushing, which were  expected 
in subjects receiving prostanoid therapy.  A low discontinuation rate due to AEs in the 
prima
ry analysis population and the type of AEs resulting in discontinuation (mostly PGI 2 
re
lated, which are not life threatening) indicate that use of UT- 15C may provide a significant 
im
provement in the safety profile of treprostinil and result in a reduction in the occurrence of 
life-threatening AEs compared with parenteral treprostinil therapy (e.g., central venous 
catheter-related blood stream infection ). 
TDE- PH-308 was a 16-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, international 
P
hase 3 efficacy and safety study of UT-15C in patients with PAH.  Patients received UT-15C 
or placebo BID in combination with either an ERA, a PDE5-I, or both.  The primary endpoint 
was placebo-corrected change in 6MWD from Baseline to Week 16.  Secondary endpoints 
included Borg dyspnea score, dyspnea-fatigue index, WHO Functional Class and time to 
clinical worsening.  Study drug dose was titrated up to a maximum of 16 mg BID based on 
clinical response and study drug tolerability. 
Three-hundred-ten subjects (157 UT-15C and 153 placebo) were randomized, received a dose 
of study drug, and contributed to the analysis population for the study.  The study population 
ha
d a mean age of 51 years (range 18 to 76 years), was 78% female and had a diagnosis of 
idi
opathic or heritable PAH (65%), PAH related to CVD (31%), PAH related to HIV infection

 Oral Treprostinil 
Version date: [ADDRESS_378512] 2017 Confidential Page 27 (2%), or PAH related to repaired systemic- to-pulmonary shunts (1%).  The population was 
pre
dominantly WHO Functional Class III (73%) with a mean Baseline 6MWD of 333 m.  As 
for PAH-approved background therapy, 53 (17%) subjects were receiving ERA therapy alone, 
132 (43%) subjects were receiving a PDE5-I alone, and 125 (40%) subjects were receiving 
the combination of an ERA and a PDE5-I at Baseline.  The UT -15C and placebo groups were 
well balanced across all Baseline indices. 
The primary efficacy analysis comparing change in 6MWD from Baseline to W eek 16 
be
tween treatment groups was +10 m (H-L estimate; p=0.089).  The UT -15C group improved 
by a median of +15 m compared to a +11 m median change in the placebo group.  Placebo-
corrected changes from Baseline in 6MWD at Week 16 by [CONTACT_308757]-approved background 
therapy were as follows: ERA only (H-L estimate of treatment effect = +7.7 m; p=0.739), 
PDE5-I only (H- L estimate = +15.0 m; p=0.054), and combination ERA and PDE5-I (H- L

1.3
 RATIONALE FOR DEVELOPMENT OF STUDY DRUG IN PAH 
Prostacyclin is a potent endogenous vasodilator and inhibitor of platelet aggregation.  A 
synthetic salt of PGI 2 (i.e., Flolan) has been previously shown to prolong survival in patients 
with P
AH [Barst 1996].  However, due to its very short half-life and chemical instability, 
Flolan has to be continuously infused by [CONTACT_308758].  Treprostinil sodium is a 
chemically stable, longer acting analogue that has shown clinical effectiveness when 
administered by [CONTACT_6567], intravenous (Remodulin) [Remodulin package insert, 2013], or 
inhale
d routes (Tyvaso) [Tyvaso package insert, 2013]. 
P
arenteral PGI 2 are considered by [CONTACT_308759] “gold standard” for treatment of 
P
AH; however, they are typi[INVESTIGATOR_308733].  Consequently, physicians managing patients with 
PAH commonly initiate oral monotherapy, to allow patients to benefit from the simplicity of 
a
n oral dosage form. 
Effective treatment of PAH often requires combination therapy with several drugs.  Current 
guidelines suggest that if patients in WHO Functional Classes II, III, or IV do not demonstrate 
improvement, sequential combination therapy with several PAH-specific drugs is appropriate 
[Barst 2009].  Several studies have previously demonstrated a benefit of sequential 
combination therapy, particularly when combining PGI [ADDRESS_378516] and bosentan combination 
therapy over 12 weeks, resulting in a near significant increase in 6MWD (p=0.051) after 
il
oprost inhalation (McLaughlin et al., 2006).  The PACES study demonstrated improvements 
in exercise capacity and hemodynamic parameters when sildenafil and intravenous 
epoprostenol were used in combination (Simonneau et al., 2008).  The TRIUMPH-I study 
e
valuated the efficacy of inhaled treprostinil (Tyvaso®) c ompared with placebo in patients 
United Therapeutics Corporation TDE- PH-310 Amendment 8 
 Oral Treprostinil 
Version date: [ADDRESS_378517] 2017 Confidential Page 29 already receiving treatment with either bosentan or sildenafil and found a statistically 
sig
nificant increase in 6MWD at peak and trough treprostinil exposure (p<0.0006 and p<0.01, 
respectively) (McLaughlin et al., 2010).  An innovative salt form, treprostinil diethanolamine, 
ha
s been developed to deliver PGI 2 therapy via the oral route in a solid dosage form.  Because 
the bioactive species is the same, treprostinil diethanolamine is expected to retain a similar 
safety and efficacy profile as parenteral treprostinil sodium in the convenience of an oral 
dosage form.  It has been suggested combination therapy, particularly with a PGI 2, ma y 
prevent or delay the progression of the disease and thereby [CONTACT_308760]. 
1.4 CLINICAL HYPOTHESIS 
The
 hypothesis of this study is that treatment with oral UT-15C combined with 
P
AH-approved oral monotherapy as compared with placebo with PAH-approved oral 
monotherapy will: 
 D elay time to first clinical worsening (morbidity or mortality) event  
The
 hypothesis for the change of dosing frequency from BID to TID is that delivering more 
sustained concentrations of treprostinil may allow for systemic exposure to drug that more 
closely resembles the approved parenteral product, Remodulin, and reduce the occurrence of 
PGI [ADDRESS_378518] 
clinical worsening.

 Lung or heart/lung transplantation; or 
 A trial septostomy 
 I nitiation of an inhaled or infused PGI 2 for the treatment of worsening PAH 
 Disease progression (all criteria required): 
 A decrease in 6MWD of at least 15% from Baseline (or too ill to walk) directly 
related to PAH progression with other co-morbidities ruled out, confirmed by [CONTACT_1192] 
6MWTs performed on different days* 
 Worsening of PAH symptoms, which must include either 
An increase in functional class from Baseline or  
Appearance or worsening of symptoms of right heart failure since Baseline 
 Unsatisfactory long-term clinical response (all criteria required) 
 Randomized to receive study drug for at least 24 weeks 
 A de crease from Baseline in 6MWD at Week 24 and beyond at two consecutive 
visits on different days*  
 Sustained WHO Functional Class III or IV symptoms for at least 24 weeks 
consecutively  
*Confirmatory 6MWTs should be conducted within 30 days of the qualifying decrease in 
6MWD; however, confirmatory 6MWTs occurring outside of this window will still be

3.2.1 Efficacy 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Clinical Worsening 
Clinical worsening will be assessed continuously from randomization until the subject’s  last 
study visit.  All clinical worsening events will be reviewed by [CONTACT_308764].  To 
ensure subject eligibility for the open-label extension study (TDE- PH- 311), subjects should 
remain on study drug until the clinical worsening event has been reviewed and confirmed by [CONTACT_308765].  Clinical worsening (adjudicated) is defined as the occurrence of 
any one of the following clinical worsening (morbidity or mortality) events: 
 Death (all causes) 
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_308734]: 
 Non -elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_260003] 24 hours in duration caused by [CONTACT_308762]/or right heart failure; or 
 Lung or heart/lung transplantation; or 
 Atria l septostomy 
 Initiation of an inhaled or infused PGI 2 for the treatment of worsening PAH 
 Dise ase progression (all criteria required): 
 A de crease in 6MWD of at least 15% from Baseline (or too ill to walk) directly 
related to PAH progression with other co-morbidities ruled out, confirmed by [CONTACT_1192] 
6MWTs performed on different days* 
 W orsening of PAH symptoms, which must include either 
 An increase in functional class from Baseline or 
 Appearance or worsening of symptoms of right heart failure since Baseline 
 Unsa tisfactory long-term clinical response (all criteria required) 
 Randomized to receive study drug for at least 24 weeks 
 A de crease from Baseline in 6MWD at Week 24 and beyond at two consecutive visits 
on different days* 
 Sustained WHO Functional Class III or IV symptoms for at least 24 weeks 
consecutively 
*Confirmatory 6MWTs should be conducted within 30 days of the qualifying decrease in 
6MWD; however, confirmatory 6MWTs occurring outside of this window will still be 
considered to have met the definition of clinical worsening and sent to the adjudication 
committee for review.

case report form (eCRF) and should be submitted within [ADDRESS_378534] ug Termination visit assessments. 
C
linical worsening events that meet the definition of a serious adverse event (SAE) will follow 
the same reporting requirements as all SAEs (Section 9.3).  These events must also be entered on 
the 
specified form in the eCRF. 
In addition to the Medical Monitor reviewing all clinical worsening events as and when they 
occur, an independent adjudication committee will review all clinical worsening events 
pe
riodically throughout the study (Section 10.8).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Six-Minute Walk Test 
The intent of the 6MWT is to evaluate exercise capacity associated with carrying out activities of 
daily living.  All 6MWTs will be conducted by [CONTACT_3784], trained personnel in a designated 
6MW
T area which meets the requirements as described in Section 15.1.  Prior to the start of each 
6MW
T the subject should rest (seated) for at least 5 minutes. 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_378535] 1 day prior to the Randomization 6MWT for applicable 
subjects. 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_378536] be conducted no earlier than 1 day 
following the practice 6MWT, for applicable subjects.  Once the Baseline 6MWT has been

 Oral Treprostinil 
Version date: [ADDRESS_378537]’s six-minute walk distance into an interactive voice or 
we
b response system (IVRS/IWRS).  IVRS/IWRS will confirm to  site personnel the subject’s 
e
ligibility to participate in the study based on 6MWD, and if eligible, randomize the subject into 
a
 treatment group and allocate appropriate study drug. 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_378538] continue to receive the same flow rate 
a
nd mode of oxygen therapy at all subsequent 6MWT assessments; any changes in oxygen 
ther
apy administration should be noted in the e CRF .  In addition, subjects receiving pulmonary 
re
habilitation prior to study entry should continue on the same schedule up to and including 
Week 24.  Following Week 24, pulmonary rehabilitation may be adjusted per standard of care.  
Pulmonary rehabilitation m ay not be added to a subject’s regimen  between randomization and 
W
eek 24.  Documentation of pulmonary rehabilitation should occur in the special circumstances 
section of the eCRF.  Additional 6MWTs may be conducted as appropriate throughout the course 
of the study for the purposes of evaluating clinical worsening status. 
Each 6MWT conducted after Randomization should be documented and compared to the 
subject’s Baseline 6MWD.  If a subject has a decrease of 15% or more in walk distance 
compared to Baseline, a second confirmatory 6MWT should be performed on a different day to 
a
ssess for clinical worsening (confirmatory 6MWTs should be conducted within 30 days of the 
qualifying decrease in 6MWD; however, confirmatory 6MWTs occurring outside of this window 
will
 still be considered to have met the definition of clinical worsening and sent to the 
adjudication committee for review).  If the second 6MWT also shows at least 15% decrease in 
6MWD as compared to Baseline and the subject has either worsened in WHO Functional Class 
c
ompared to Baseline or has the appearance or worsening of symptoms of right heart failure 
since Baseline, the subject will meet the ‘disease progression ’ definition of clinical worsening 
a
nd should follow steps as outlined in Section [IP_ADDRESS] .  Prior to exiting the study, the Study Drug 
Termination visit assessments should be conducted at the time the decision is made to 
discontinue study drug (prior to down titration).  For subjects who meet the definition of clinical 
United Therapeutics Corporation TDE -PH-310 Amendment 8 
 Oral Treprostinil 
Version date: [ADDRESS_378539] a 15% decrease in 6MWD from Baseline, the 
da
te of the clinical worsening event will be the date of the second confirmatory 6MWT. 
After the first [ADDRESS_378540] will meet the clinical worsening definition of unsatisfactory long-term clinical response 
a
nd should follow steps outlined in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
De
tails regarding the conduct of the 6MWT are described in Section 15.1. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Borg Dyspnea Score 
The Borg dyspnea score will be assessed following each 6MWT.  The Borg dyspnea score is a 
10-point scale rating the maximum level of dyspnea experienced during the 6MWT 
(Se
ction 15.1).   Scores range from 0 (for the best condition) to 10 (for the worst condition). 
[IP_ADDRESS]  WHO Functional Classification 
The WHO functional classification for PAH (Section 15.2) will be assessed at Baseline prior to 
starting study drug and at all subsequent scheduled study visits, and every time the 6MWT is 
performed for purposes of assessing clinical worsening status.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  N-terminal pro-BNP 
Plasma NT -proBNP concentration is a useful biomarker for PAH as it is associated with changes 
in right heart morphology and function [Fijalkowska 2006].  NT-proBNP sample collection will 
occur at Baseline (prior to starting study drug), Week 12, Week 24, the first Continued Visit, and 
e
very other Continued Visit thereafter (i.e., Continued Visits #3, #5, #7, etc.).  NT-proBNP will 
a
lso be assessed at the Study Drug Termination visit. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Right Heart Catheterization (Optional Assessment) 
This section describes the optional RHC assessments that may be conducted at Baseline and 
Week 24.  
If a subject agrees to participate in the optional hemodynamic assessments, a RHC must be 
performed within 5 days before randomization (inclusive).  The subject must be on stable 
United Therapeutics Corporation TDE -PH-310 Amendment 8 
 Oral Treprostinil 
Version date: [ADDRESS_378541] as possible, follow-up RHC 
should be performed within 3 to 6 hours of previous dose.  Hemodynamic parameters to be 
a
ssessed and recorded include heart rate (HR), systolic systemic arterial pressure (SAPs), 
diastolic systemic arterial pressure (SAPd), mean systemic arterial pressure (SAPm), systolic 
pulmonary artery pressure (PAPs), diastolic pulmonary artery pressure (PAPd), mean pulmonary 
a
rtery pressure (PAPm), mean right atrial pressure (RAPm), mean pulmonary capi[INVESTIGATOR_308735] (PCWPm), cardiac output (CO ) , arterial oxygen saturation (SaO 2), and mixed venous 
oxygen saturation (SvO 2).  Additional hemodynamic parameters may also be calculated based on 
these
 measurements (e.g., pulmonary vascular resistance [PVR] and cardiac index [CI]).  Weight 
a
nd height will be collected to calculate body surface area (BSA) and index the cardiac output. 
W
hile this section describes the optional RHC assessments at Baseline and Week 24, all subjects 
e
ligible to participate in this study must either have data available from a historical RHC 
conducted within three years prior to the start of screening (i.e., date of signing the Informed 
C
onsent Form [ICF]), or undergo a RHC during the screening period prior to randomization with 
results consistent with the diagnosis of PAH as described in Section 4.1. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Optional Biomarker 
For subjects consenting to the optional biomarker samples, blood and urine will be collected at 
the End of Study Visit for the evaluation of biomarkers.  These samples will be shipped to the 
central laboratory for processing and storage prior to analysis.  Subjects who do not wish to 
participate in the optional biomarker research may still participate in the clinical study. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Optional Pharmacogenomic 
For subjects consenting to pharmacogenomic analysis, blood samples will be collected at the 
End of Study Visit for pharmacogenomics analyses.  These samples will be shipped to the central 
labor
atory for processing and storage prior to analysis.  Genetic variants and/or gene expression 
patterns will be analyzed to evaluate their association with observed clinical response and

pha
rmacogenomic research may still participate in the clinical study. 
3.2.2 Safety   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Medical History and Physical Examinations 
A complete medical history, demographics, PAH history, and physical examination will be 
conducted during the Screening period.  Significant past or present illnesses, current prescription 
or no
nprescription medications (including vitamins and herbal products), and history of allergies 
or idios
yncratic responses to drugs should be noted in the eCRF.  Any significant changes to the 
subject ’s medical condition, physical examination, and concomitant medications must be 
documented throughout the course of the study.  A complete physical examination will be 
c
onducted at the Study Drug Termination Visit. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Clinical Laboratory Tests 
Clinical laboratory tests will be assessed at the Screening and Baseline visits prior to starting 
study drug.  Screening and Baseline clinical laboratory assessments can be combined into a 
sing
le blood draw if all eligibility criteria are met within [ADDRESS_378543] Continued Visit, and every other Continued Visit thereafter (i.e., Continued Visits #3, 
#5, #7, etc.) as displayed in Appendix 15.3.  Clinical laboratory tests will also be assessed at the 
S
tudy Drug Termination visit. 
A urine pregnancy test will be collected at Screening, Baseline, Weeks 4, 8, 12, 24, every 
12 weeks thereafter, and at the Study Drug Termination Visit for women of child bearing 
potential (WOCBP).  Screening and Baseline urine pregnancy tests can be combined into a 
sing
le test if all eligibility criteria are met within 48 hours prior to randomization.

 Oral Treprostinil 
Version date: [ADDRESS_378544] 2017 Confidential Page 41  [IP_ADDRESS]  Vital Signs  
Vital signs will be assessed at Screening and Baseline prior to starting study medication and at 
Weeks 4, 8, 12, and 24.  After Week 24, vital signs will be assessed every [ADDRESS_378545] 30 minutes 
following
 the corresponding 6MWT.  Vital signs include blood pressure, peripheral 
(r
adial/brachial artery) heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], and weight.  Height will be collected at the 
B
aseline visit.  Vital signs must be collected following at least [ADDRESS_378546] (or at least 
30 minutes after a 6MWT) to ensure accurate measurement. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Events 
AEs will be captured from the time the ICF is signed.  All AEs should be followed until either 
resolution (or return to normal or Baseline values), until they are judged by [CONTACT_308766], or for up to [ADDRESS_378547] to follow-up even if they 
a
re ongoing more than 30 days after completion of the final visit.  Sections 9 and 15.4 provide 
the guidelines and definitions for recording AEs. 
Symptoms of PAH (disease related events) should only be recorded as an AE if the event is 
either serious, new, or unusual with respect to intensity, frequency, duration as compared to 
symptoms in the subject’s medical history; or there is a reasonable possibility that the event was 
caused by [CONTACT_5257]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  12-Lead ECG 
Twelve-lead ECGs will be recorded after at least [ADDRESS_378548] five QRS complexes.  ECG parameters collected 
include heart rate, PR interval, QT interval, QRS duration, and any clinically significant 
a
bnormalities.

5.1 T REATMENT ASSIGNMENT 
Eligible subjects will be randomly allocated to receive either UT-15C or placebo at 
randomization.  During the Screening period a screening number will be assigned using an 
electronic data capture (EDC) system to identify individual subject data until the subject is 
ra
ndomized.  Upon randomization, each subject will be assigned a new unique study subject 
number
 via the IVRS/IWRS.  The IVRS/IWRS will also be responsible for allocation of all study 
drug. 
5.2 RA NDOMIZATION 
The study will be randomized 1:1 UT-15C to placebo.  All subjects will be randomly allocated to 
receive UT - 15C or placebo through the IVRS/IWRS using a centrally administered stratified 
permuted block randomization by [CONTACT_308773] (Strata 1: PDE5-I and sGC

also be stratified by [INVESTIGATOR_31975] 6MWD (less than or equal to 350 meters and greater than 
350 meters).  Block sizes will be variable and not disclosed to Investigators so that no inferences

 The  subject violated the protocol 
 The  subject’s behavior is likely to undermine the validity of his/her results 
 The  subject experiences clinical worsening 
 The  subject becomes pregnant 
If a subject is discontinued from the study prematurely, the Investigator will complete the End of 
Study Record for that subject and provide an explanation, if needed.  For subjects who meet the 
definition of clinical worsening, the site must complete the specified eCRF page (see 
Section [IP_ADDRESS]).  If study drug has been administered, the Investigator should make every effort 
to per

and study discontinuation. 
8.2 CRITERIA FOR TERMINATING THE STUDY 
The
 study may be stopped at any time if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_3755]/or sponsor, 
continuation of the study represents a serious medical risk to the subjects.  This may include, but 
is not limited to, the presence of serious, life-threatening, or fatal AEs or AEs that are 
unacceptable in nature, severity, or frequency.  The sponsor reserves the right to discontinue the 
study for any reason at any time. 
The end of the study (study completion) will be declared and subjects will be transitioned out of 
the study based on the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) and Sponsor’s decision following the

The study may also be terminated at a given center if: 
 The  Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_308740] 
 The  sponsor elects to discontinue the study at the site 
 Applicable regulations are not observed 
 The protocol is repeatedly violated or critical violations are documented 
 C hanges in personnel or facilities adversely affect performance of the study 
[ADDRESS_378615]’s health, as well as abnormal laboratory findings if 
deemed to have clinical significance.  AEs may also include worsening of an existing symptom 
or condition or pre/post-treatment events that occur as a result of protocol-mandated procedures. 
9.1.2 Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is an AE occurring at any dose that results in any of the following outcomes: 
 De ath 
 A life -threatening AE 
 I npatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
 A pe rsistent or significant disability/incapacity 
 A c ongenital anomaly/birth defect 
In addition, important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they 
may jeopardize the subject and require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above.  Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm 
requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions 
that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.

values), until they are judged by [CONTACT_80196], or for up 
to [ADDRESS_378620] to follow-up even if they are ongoing more 
than 30 days after completion of the final visit.  Supplemental measurements and/or evaluations 
may be necessary to investigate fully the nature and/or causality of an AE or SAE.  This may 
include additional laboratory tests, diagnostic procedures, or consultation with other healthcare 
professionals.  The eCRF pages should be updated with any new or additional information as 
appropriate. 
9.2.1 Clinical Worsening Events 
Clinical worsening events for this study include all clinical worsening (morbidity or mortality) 
events that meet the definition for clinical worsening (Section [IP_ADDRESS]).  When these events 
oc
cur, they must be docu mented in the subject’s source documents and on the specified page of 
the eCRF and should be electronically submitted using the electronic eCRF platform within 
48 hours after the event becomes known to the Investigator or designee.  The Medical Monitor 
will
 review the event and correspond with the Investigator and site, as appropriate.  Although 
subjects may be discontinued from the study for medical necessity at any time, subjects should 
not be discontinued for a clinical worsening event until the event has been reviewed by [CONTACT_5134].  Any clinical worsening event that is also an SAE(s) will be reported per the 
guidelines as specified in Sections 9.[ADDRESS_378621] be forwarded to Global 
Drug Safety at United Therapeutics Corporation within 48 hours of the receipt of any 
new/updated information.  The Investigator must also promptly notify their Investigational

The Borg dyspnea score is a 10-point scale rating the maximum level of dyspnea experienced 
during the 6MWT.  Scores range from 0 (for the best condition) to 10 (for the worst condition). 
The difference between treatment groups for the change from Baseline to each follow-up 
assessment will be tested using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Combined 6MWD and Borg Dyspnea Score 
The intent of the 6MWT is to evaluate exercise capacity associated with carrying out activities of 
daily living.  However, the capacity of subjects to function is determined not only by [CONTACT_308784] 
c
an do when they exert themselves to the fullest, but also by [CONTACT_308785].  It is therefore important not only to look at the 
distance traversed during the unencouraged 6MWT but also the symptoms experienced at the 
end of the effort.  To do so, walk distances and Borg dyspnea scores from each follow-up 6MWT 
will
 be simultaneously compared between treatment groups using non-parametric analysis of 
covariance within the framework of the extended Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test (analogous to 
the analysis methodology for 6MWD). This methodology will be carried out as follows: 
1. S tandardized mid-ranks of walk distance will be calculated as described for the analysis 
of 6MWD; 
2. S tandardized mid-ranks of Borg dyspnea score will be calculated in an analogous 
manner; 
3. The  standardized mid-ranks for walk distance and for Borg dyspnea score will be 
combined by [CONTACT_308786];

When you arrive back at the starting point you will go back and forth again.  You will go back 
and forth as many times as you can in the 6-minute period.  You may stop and rest if you need 
to.  Just remain where you are until you can go on again.  However, the most important thing 
about the test is that you cover as much ground as you possibly can during the 6 minutes.  I will

stand right wh ere you are.” 
After these instructions are given to the subject, the person administering the test will then ask: 
“Do you have any questions about the test?”  
“Please explain to me what you are going to do.”  
The person administering the test will then start the test by [CONTACT_3810]: 
“Are you ready?”

Borg Scale.  The person will use the following dialogue: 
“
I would like to use the following scale to indicate the maximal shortness of breath you had 
during the walk test (indicate the Borg Scale).  If there was no shortness of breath at all you 
would point to 0; if the shortness of breath was not very great you would choose from 0.5 to

 “How are you doing (feeling)?”  
Based on the subject’s response to this question, the Investigator should ask additional questions 
relevant to the specific complaint such as: 
 “How severe is/was the symptom?”  
 “How often did the symptom occur?”  
 “How long did the symptom last?”  
Using provided definitions, the Investigator will then: 
(1) rate the intensity and seriousness of the AE, (2) estimate the causality of the AE to study 
drug, and (3) note actions taken to counteract the AE. 
Definitions of Intensity, Seriousness, Causality, Action Taken, and Outcome 
INTENSITY 
An assessment of the relative intensity (severity) of an AE is based on the I nvestigator’s clinical 
judgment.  The maximum intensity encountered during the evaluation period should be checked.  
The assessment of intensity should be independent of the assessment of the seriousness of the 
AE.  
SERIOUSNESS 
A serious AE is one that represents an actual or potential significant hazard.  This includes, but is 
not limited to, an event that is fatal, life-threatening, permanently or severely disabling, requires 
or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], is a congenital abnormality (offspring of subject) or is 
medically significant (important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, 
or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious AE when, based upon appropriate medical

CA[LOCATION_003]LITY 
An estimate of causality between a specified AE and the study drug is made by [CONTACT_737].  
Definitions of the categories follow: 
 NO T RELATED - there is not a temporal relationship to study drug administration (too 
early, or late, or study drug not taken), or there is a reasonable causal relationship 
be
tween another drug, or concurrent disease and the SAE 
 P OSSIBLE - there is a reasonable causal relationship between the study drug and the 
SAE.  Dechallenge information is lacking or unclear 
 PROBABLE - there is a reasonable causal relationship between the study drug and the 
SAE.  The event responds to dechallenge.  Rechallenge is not required 
ACTION TAKEN 
TEST AGENT DOSE MODIFICATION* 
 Dose  Increased - the dose or regimen of the test agent was increased 
 Dose Not Changed - the dose or regimen of the test agent was not changed 
 Dose  Reduced - the dose or regimen of the test agent was decreased 
 Dr ug Interrupted - administration of the test agent was stopped temporarily 
 Drug Withdrawn - administration of the test agent was stopped permanently and not 
restarted 
 Unknown - changes to the administration of the test agent cannot be determined 
*NO
TE:  Only the last test agent action should be recorded in the eCRF. 
OUTCOME 
 Fatal - The study subject died  
 Not Recovered/Not Resolved - The AE was ongoing 
 R ecovered/Resolved - The AE resolved 
 R ecovered/Resolved with Sequelae - The AE is considered resolved however there is a 
residual sequelae 
 R ecovering/Resolving - The AE is improving but is not yet completely 
recovered/resolved 
 Unknown - The outcome of the AE cannot be determined

from the Study or Open-Label Extension Study (TDE- PH-311)  
1 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 
Eve
n though subjects may discontinue from the study or open-label extension study 
(TDE- PH-311) for a variety of reasons, it is important to continue collecting vital status data on 
such subjects until the study is completed.  Collection of the vital status data will allow an 
int
ention- to-treat overall survival analysis to be conducted using actual rather than imputed vital 
status data. This will be a separate analysis from the primary and secondary efficacy analysis and 
will provide supportive data for regulatory filings of oral treprostinil. 
If and when a subject discontinues from the study or open-label extension study (TDE- PH-311), 
attempts should be made to obtain their consent to record their vital status up to the date of final 
completion of the study (i.e., when all patient have exited the study).  Attempts should be made 
to collec
t survival data on all subjects, even those who are apparently lost to follow-up.

stud
y (TDE- PH-311) to support an overall survival analysis of study participants 
[ADDRESS_378664]
atus for subjects who discontinue from the study or open-label extension study 
(TDE- PH-311) will be assessed every 6-months from their date of discontinuation via telephone 
calls and/or other methods as described below for the duration of the study. The data will 
continue to be collected in this study until the last subject has exited from the study.  
Subjects are considered to have discontinued from the study if and when they discontinue and do 
not enroll into the open-label extension study (TDE- PH-311). Subjects are considered to have 
prematurely discontinued from the open-label extension study (TDE- PH-311) if they discontinue 
before the completion of the study (i.e.,  before the last subject has exited the study).

 I f dead, the date of death must be obtained.  
 I f alive, the last known date the subject was confirmed to be alive must be provided.  
 F or those subjects who are lost to follow-up, the last known date that the subject was 
confirmed to be alive will be their date of the last contact [CONTACT_36362].  
Methods to confirm subjects’ survival status other than the reco mmended telephone calls every 
6 months, may include and are not limited to, in-person study visits, searching of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_308750], and searching local and/or national public registries following applicable laws and 
regulations.  
Any AEs that are spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_308795]-available

subject to AE/SAE reporting under local government post-marketing AE/SAE reporting 
requirements.  
6 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
Vital status data collected from subjects who discontinue from the study or open-label extension 
study (TDE- PH-311) will be combined with the data collected during the study and the 
open -label extension study (TDE- PH-311) for sensitivity analysis of overall survival.  Vital 
status data collection from subjects who have discontinued the study minimizes the missing data 
for these analysis.

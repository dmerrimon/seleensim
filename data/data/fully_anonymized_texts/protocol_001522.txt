 1 Introduction 
This document is a protocol for a human research study. This study will be carried out in accordance 
with this protocol and the applicable U nited States  government regulations including Food and Drug 
Regulations 21 CFR Part 50 (Human Subject Protections), Part 54 (Financial Disclosure of Clinical Investigators), Part 56 (Institutional Review Boards ), Part 312 (IND) and Good Clinical Practice 
guideline s, as well as  the applicabl e Mayo Clinic research policies and procedures.  
1.1 Background 
Mitochondrial disease ( MtD ) includes a large number of human disorders with a collective 
prevalence of 10 -15 cases per 100,000, resulting from functional defects in the mitochondrial 
electron transport chain (ETC). ETC defects impair the production of ATP and also enhance the 
generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to the combination of energy deficit and 
oxidative damage underlying the pathogenesis of MtD. Given the vital role played by [CONTACT_705368], ETC defects may affect virtually any tissue or organ system and present with a 
wide variety of symptoms in both children and adults. Progressive multisystem involvement occurs 
in most patients with variable combinations of neurological, muscular, cardiac, metabolic and other 
deficits  [1]. The clinical complexity of MtD  is associated with equally significant genetic complexity 
owing to the fact that a large number of both mitochondrial and nuclear genes are required for the 
biogenesis and function of the ETC. Indeed, while ETC defects were originally linked to mutations 
in mitochondrial genes, over [ADDRESS_958521] the integrity of the mitochondrial genome, the a ssembly of specific ETC 
complexes, and the synthesis or delivery of metal or Fe-S cofactors needed for ETC activity [ 1].  
 
Research Idea:  While many recent advancements in genetic and biochemical testing facilitate the 
diagnosis of MtD, there is no effective therapy available for this group of disorders as a whole [ 2]. In 
light of the common underlying pathogenic mechanism of energy deficit and oxidative damage, we 
hypothesize that the induction of mitochondrial biogenesis and bioenergetics along with 
simultaneous up- regulation of the cellular antioxidant defenses is a strategy capable to ameliorate 
MtD . To test this hypothesis we propose to conduct a phase II drug clinical trial to test the efficacy 
of a pharmaceutical grade synthetically -produced form of Epi[INVESTIGATOR_26874] (EPI) in patients with 
Friedreich's Ataxia.  
 
Why EPI? (- ) EPI [CONTACT_832] a naturally occurring flavonoid that has shown to have similar health benefits 
to exercise training  [3]. Preliminary observations suggest the existence of a signaling mechanism 
that may induce mitochondrial biogenesis and lead to regeneration of skeletal muscle fibers and neurons depleted of mitochondria, induction of endogenous anti -oxidant enzymes such as superoxide 
dismutase and catalase, and stimulation of lipid oxidative metabolism and  glucose uptake thereby 
[CONTACT_705369]  (Figure 1) [[ 4] and Cardero  Therapeutics’ unpublished 
data]. The working hypothesis is that

this signaling mechanism is 
physiologically activated during exercise  
and would activate transcription factors that would induce the effects described above. Therefore , EPI [INVESTIGATOR_705241] . This working hypothesis is supported 
by (i) evidence that EPI [INVESTIGATOR_705242]  [
3]; (ii) the positive effects on 
cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes associated with the consumption of EPI -
rich foods  [5, 6]; and (iii) the positive 
effects of purified EPI [INVESTIGATOR_705243]  [7], oxidative stress  [8], 
metabolism [ 9, 10], skeletal muscle growth 
and differentiation  [ 11] and

Therapeutics has developed the first scalable manufacturing process that provides pharmaceutical grade (+) -EPI. This manufacturing process has  already been accept ed by [CONTACT_705370] a 
previously filed IND for determining the tolerability and PK profile of (+) -EPI [INVESTIGATOR_705249]. Given the severity of FA, we propose studying the effects of the more potent enantiomer of epi[INVESTIGATOR_26874] . In addition, EPI [INVESTIGATOR_705250], readily crosses the blood -brain barrier, 
and is generally recognized as a safe compound  [9, 12]. 
 
Why FA? FA is a paradigm for MtD in which intronic  trinucleotide repeat expansions in the FA 
gene lead to depletion of the mitochondrial protein frataxin [ 16]. Frataxin is an essential iron 
chaperone required for Fe- S cluster assembly, and a reduction in the levels of frataxin leads to ETC 
dysfunction, energy deficit and oxidative damage via iron- catalyzed Fenton chemistr y [17]. FA 
patients develop progressive neuro- degenerative disease often associated with cardiomyopathy, 
diabetes mellitus, and muscle weakness with a median age of onset of [ADDRESS_958522]

1.2 Investigational Agent 
Description: 
Cardero Therapeutics has sy nthesized pharmaceutical grade (+) Epi[INVESTIGATOR_26874], a more active natural 
product enantiomer of epi[INVESTIGATOR_26874], which is otherwise not available in a purified form. EPI [INVESTIGATOR_705252] -1α [9], upregulates endogenous antioxidant mechanisms (SOD2, catalase) 
controlled by [CONTACT_705371]2 (nuclear factor -E2-related factor -2) pathway [ 18], promotes fatty acid 
oxidation through regulation of SIRT3 (Sirtuin 3) signaling  [9, 19] and enhances insulin s ensitivity 
through the PI3K/AKT (Phosphoinositide 3- kinase/ Protein kinase B) pathway and AMPK  [10] 
which may further improve metabolic dysfunction in FA.  Pharmacology:

Henry (IND 122158),  by [CONTACT_705372],  2015, and Ottaviani et al, 2011 [ 20, 21].  Numerous 
publications indicate the polyphenol epi[INVESTIGATOR_705254] I hepatic metabolism mediated by [CONTACT_9058] P450 oxidases. In the liver, (-)- EPI [INVESTIGATOR_705255] (by [CONTACT_10834]-5-

which results in  glucuronide, sulfate, or methyl con jugates /metabolites , accounting for more than

skeletal muscle growth and differentiation [ 32]. 
 
EPI [CONTACT_832] a neuroprotectant and inducer of neural regeneration. Neuronal injury as a result of  
mitochondrial dysfunction is a component of the pathophysiology of Friedreich’s ataxia. There is 
evidence for direct effects of epi[INVESTIGATOR_705270].  Wild -type mice pretreated orally 
with epi[INVESTIGATOR_705271] (MCAO) had significantly smaller brain 
infarcts and improved neurologic deficit scores (NDS) than did a vehicle -treated group  [33].  
 
In a medium throughput screen for neuroprotective compounds using primary mixed neuronal cells and a mitochondrial toxin, epi[INVESTIGATOR_705272] a potent direct neuroprotectant. It 
effectively decreased intracellular oxidative stress and normalized the signaling pathway of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) [ 12].  
 Cell viability assays with neuronal cultures further confirmed that epi[INVESTIGATOR_705273]. With particular relevance to FA, much of the neuronal benefit appeared to be due to the induction of endogenous anti -oxidant m echanisms controlled by [CONTACT_705371]2 
pathway [ 18].  
 Effects of (+) -Epi[INVESTIGATOR_705274] . Studies have been performed to evaluate effects on

mg/kg/day) or (+) -epi[INVESTIGATOR_26874]  (0.1, 0.3 or 1 mg/kg/day) . Endpoints evaluated include the 
mitochondrial biogenesis transcription factors AMPK  and PGC1- α. (Figure 2) Results indicate that 
following 2 weeks of treatment, (+) -epi[INVESTIGATOR_705275] (as assessed by

Biochemical analyses (Western blots) of muscle samples from the above mice demonstrated a similar pattern of responses, whereby (+) -epi[INVESTIGATOR_296188] n 
was as effective at lower doses or more effective at comparable doses when probing for effects on 
recognized key modulators of metabolism.

1.5 Dose Rationale and Risk/Benefits 
For this study, (+) -EPI [INVESTIGATOR_705286] a starting dose of 75 mg total daily dose (25 mg 
TID)   escalated to 150mg total daily dose (50 mg TID) for those subjects not showing improvement 
at 12 weeks.  (+)-EPI [INVESTIGATOR_705287] 3 (+/ -1), 12 (+/-1), and 24 (+/-
1) weeks of treatment to ass ess study drug dosing compliance.   
The dosage is supported by 3 factors: 
1) Human efficacy has been demonstrated with ( -) Epi[INVESTIGATOR_705288] 1.0-1.5 mg/kg [ 4, 20, 34] 
given at  50 mg twice a day for up to 8 weeks. The twice a day dosing was chosen bec ause 
once a day dosing did not demonstrate efficacy, presumably because of the short half -life ( 
Barnett et al,2015) 
2) At 1 mg/kg in animals, (+) -Epi[INVESTIGATOR_705289]1alpha than (- ) –Epi[INVESTIGATOR_26874]. (Fig ure 2 , Figure 3 ) 
3) Because epi[INVESTIGATOR_705290] 1 hepatic metabolism, the pharm acokinetics in 
rats is similar to that of humans and the effective dosage in rodents predicts effective dosage in humans [ 4, 26].  FA patients will range between 25 -70 kg in weight. Therefore, we will be 
well within the in vivo documented range of efficacy in rodent models and within the safe administration of (+) -EPI [INVESTIGATOR_705291] [ 21].

3.1 General Design  
This is an open label, single center, and prospective phase II drug trial to assess the safety and 
efficacy of (+) -EPI [INVESTIGATOR_705239]’s  ataxia. Duration of the trial including recruitment 
and final assessment is estimated at  approximately 2 years: start date early 2016 to approximately 
late 2017, depending upon recruitment rate.   Subjects will be evaluated at outpatient clinic visit appointments and interested qualified subjects will be consented and offered participation in this trial. Once consent has been obtained, baseline values will be established and subjects will begin treatment and follow -up over a 24 week period. Clinical and biochemical parameters shown in Table 
1 will be assessed in each patient at baseline and at 3, 12 and 24 weeks after initiation of treatment.  See Protocol Schedule of Events in Attachment II . 
 Subjects will be dispensed bottles of 25mg capsules of open- label (+) E PI [INVESTIGATOR_705300].   All subjects will start at 75 mg total daily dose . 
Those subjects showing improvement at 12 weeks as defined below, will continue at the starting dose level of 75 mg total daily dose (one, 25mg cap TID) to [ADDRESS_958529] their dose escalated as described below for  the 
remainder of the study, as tolerated.  
 Dose Escalation at 12 weeks:  Those subjects showing no improvement or worsening in the 8  meter 
timed walk /FARS composite score or with no improvement in  cardiac function by [CONTACT_705379] 12-
week clinical assessment, as  compared to  baseline , will have the ir dose increased  at the 12 week visit 
to 150 mg total daily dose (two, 25mg caps TID) until 24 weeks, as tolerated .   
 Neurological Status Improvement Definition :  If there is no change or the timed walk is longer  at 
12 weeks than at the baseline walk time or the FARs composite score  has not changed  or has

 increased , as compared to baseline FARS composite score, this will be considered no 
improvement/worsening of neurological status.  Improvement is defined as a greater than 1 point 
decrease in the FARS composite score, as compared to the baseline composite score [ 36].  
 Cardiac Status Improvement Definition :  If the cardiac function is the same as baseline or worse 
at 12 weeks , this will be considered no improvement /worsening of cardiac LV structure/function.  
 
Improvement in left ventricular structure and function by [CONTACT_705380] :  
1. If LV mass was abnormally increased at baseline, reduction in LV mass of  > 10% from 
baseline or 
2. If LV ejection fraction was reduced  at baseline, increase in LV ejection fraction of > 5% 
from baseline or 
3. If LV end -diastolic volume was abnormally increased at baseline, reduction in LV end-
diastolic volume of > 10% from baseline. 
 Neurologic Status:  If spi[INVESTIGATOR_705301]  (based on 3D volumetric MRI), fractional 
anisotropy (based on DTI), and metabolites (based on 3D MRS) are worse at 24 weeks compared to baseline, this will be considered no improvement /worsening of neurologic structure/function.  
Worsening in neurologic structure and function by [CONTACT_705381]:  
1. If spi[INVESTIGATOR_705302] [ADDRESS_958530] volume of  > 10% from baseline or 
2. If cerebellar volumes were abnormally decreased at  24 weeks compared to baseline, 
reduction in cerebellar volume of  > 10% from baseline or 
3. If spi[INVESTIGATOR_705303] 24 weeks compared to  
baseline, reduction in fractional anisotropy of  > 10% from baseline or 
4. If cereb ellar metabolite ratios (NAA/Cr, Cho/Cr, NAA/Cho) change > 5% from baseline at 
24 weeks. 
 Study drug will be dispensed at the baseline visit for 12 (+2) weeks of dosing initially  and resupplied 
at the 12 week  visit for an additional 12 (+2) weeks of dosing at either the starting dose or escalated 
dose following re -assessment for changes in neurological and cardiac functions as described above.

3.5 Primary Safety Endpoints 
Safety endpoints will include: 
• Distribute a diary to each study participant in order to date and record symptoms of adverse events along with drug intake. All participants will be asked to contact [CONTACT_705385] [INVESTIGATOR_705308], which will then be documented in the source documents.  Participants will be asked to bring the diary 
along with their drug bottles to each clinic visit.  
• Comparison between treatment groups of the incidence and types of reported adverse events  including increase in migraine head aches , bruising or bleeding. 
The consumption of cocoa products containing the epi[INVESTIGATOR_705309] [ 37]. However, the 
migraine effect has not been validated in subsequent clinical trials, and, if it exists, 
has been attributed to the presence of phenylethylamine [ 38].  
Anti-clotting like effects have been described for foods containing  members of the 
flavonoid family including epi[INVESTIGATOR_26874], such as cocoa, tea, and guarana. There is no report as to the effects that epi[INVESTIGATOR_705310]  [14, 38, 39].

• Guarana effects on toxic and behavioral parameters were assessed in rats and mice 
subsequent to acute and chronic administrations. Experimental parameters included 
tests for antioxidant capacity in vitro, in vivo, toxicological screening, body weight, 
motor activity, death rate, and histopathological examination of viscera. Guarana 
demonstrated antioxidant effects even at low concentrations by [CONTACT_705387]. At high doses (1-2 g/kg IP and PO) it did not induce significant 
alterations in toxicological parameters. Consumption of liquids containing guarana 
evidenced unaltered weight of the animals even after prolonged (23 months ) 
administration. The percentage mortality was equivalent in control and guarana 
groups. The absence of toxicity of guarana was also demonstrated by 
[CONTACT_705388], with no alterations being detected in heart, lungs, stomach, small and large  intestine, liver, pancreas, kidneys, bladder and spleen [ 42].

•  (+)-Epi[INVESTIGATOR_26874]. Campos et al recently evaluated  the effects of standardized Guarana 
encapsulated dried extract on fati gue, sleep quality, anxiety, depression symptoms, 
and menopause in a group of breast cancer chemotherapy patients. Patients with progressive fatigue after their first cycle of chemotherapy were randomized to receive either guarana 50 mg orally twice daily (n=32) or placebo (n=43) for 21 days. After a 
7-day washout period, patients were crossed over to the opposite experimental arm. 
All patients were evaluated on days 1, 21, and 49. Guarana significantly improved fatigue measures vs. placebo on days 21 and 49. Guarana treatment did not produce 
any Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grades 2, 3, or 4 toxicities and 
did not worsen sleep quality or cause anxiety or depression [ 44].

 6 Study Procedures   
The schedule of events for patients enroll ed in this trial is shown in Attachment II.  See Section 3 for 
visit descriptions.  
7 Statistical Plan  
Statistical analysis will be performed using SAS version 9.3 (SAS Inc., Cary, NC). All tests will be 
two sided and p-values less than 0.05 will be considere d statistically significant.  
7.1 Sample Size Determination  
A recent single -center open -label pi[INVESTIGATOR_705327] -confirmed Becker 
muscular dystrophy, who received 100 mg/day of EPI [INVESTIGATOR_705328] 8 weeks. The data showed l inear 
decrease in plasma B -Type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) levels, a validated biomarker of congestive 
heart failure [ 15]. Assuming a common standard deviation of 234.[ADDRESS_958540] 80% power to detect an effect size (on BNP and possibly other biomarkers) of 1at a 5% level of significance based on a paired  t-test. NQuery 
Advisor version 6.0 was used for sample size calculations. 
7.2 Statistical Methods  
Descriptive Statistics  
All numerical data will be imported into a dedicated application of highly -innovative multivariate 
pattern recognition software developed at Mayo by   
) that provides an integrated analysis of outcome measures after statistical 
adjustment for one or more relevant covariates.  Descriptive summaries will be reported as 
frequencies and percentages for categorical variables and as mean (standard deviation) or median 
(inter -quartile range) for contin uous variables of interest. 
 
Handling of Missing Data 
Data edit checks will be performed to assess outliers or any inconsistencies done at the time of data 
entry. No imputations will be performed for any missing data.  
Multiplicity  
Given the smaller sample  size, no formal adjustment for multiple comparisons will be performed . 
We will however, report both raw (unadjusted) and false discovery rate corrected p -values.  
 Primary Hypothesis:  
In light of the common underlying pathogenic mechanism of energy deficit and oxidative damage, 
we hypothesize that the induction of mitochondrial biogenesis and bioenergetics along with 
simultaneous upregulation of the cellular antioxidant defenses is a strategy capable to ameliorate 
MtD . To test this hypothesis we propose to conduct a phase II drug clinical trial to test the efficacy 
of a novel synthetically-produced form of Epi[INVESTIGATOR_26874] (EPI) in patients with Friedreich's  Ataxia 
(FA).  For continuous endpoints such as FARS assessment, we will calculate changes from baseline 
to 12 weeks and 24 weeks. These will be summarized and mean (standard deviation) or median (inter -quartile range). We will also report 95% confidence intervals. Formal comparison to assess 

IRB # 15 -006845; (+) Epi [INVESTIGATOR_705232] [ADDRESS_958541] as 
appropriate. Analysis will also be performed using percent changes from baseline to 12 week and 24 week to account for baseline discrepancies. Data will be displayed graphically using scatter  plots to 
show the trends over time. Categorical outcomes will be compared using McNemar’s test as a test of paired proportions to account for paired nature of the data.  
 
Secondary Hypothesis 1:   
• Upregulate mitochondrial biogenesis via activation of the transcription factor PGC- 1α [9] 
which is downregulated in FA [ 45]; this may lead to higher levels of frataxin as well as 
higher levels of Fe-S proteins critical for ATP production. 
• Upregulate endogenous antioxidant mechanisms (SOD2, catalase) controlled by [CONTACT_705371]2 
pathway [ 18] which is inhibited in FA cells  [46]; this may enhance FA cells resistance to 
iron-catalyzed oxidative damage.  
• Promote fatty acid oxidation through regulation of SIRT3 signaling [ 9, 19] which is inhibited 
in FA cardiac cells and believed to contribute to the FA cardiomyopathy [ 47]. 
• Enhance insulin sensitivity through the PI3K/AKT pathway and AMPK [ 10] which may 
further improve metabolic dysfunction in FA. 
• Through the basic mechanisms described above, (+)- EPI [INVESTIGATOR_705329], cardiac, and pancreatic β cells and thereby [CONTACT_705406], cardiomyopathy and diabetes. 
 
Statistical analy sis approach for secondary endpoint will be similar to approach listed above for 
primary endpoints.   
Interim Analysis  
Interim analysis will be performed after 50% i.e. [ADDRESS_958542] completed 12 week 
follow- up. Sample size at interim analysis is too small to reach required p -value for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_705330] O’Brien Flemming Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_705331] (i.e. p-value less than 0.0054 for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_705332] . Thus decision of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_705333]. We will consider treatment to be efficacious if the cardiac MRI , neurologic MRI, and /or FARS score improve by [CONTACT_7809] 30% at

8 Safety and Adverse Eve nts 
8.1 Definitions  
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk to Subjects or Others  (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_14845])  
Any unanticipated problem or adverse event that meets the following three criteria:  
• Serious : Serious problems or events that results in significant harm, (which may be physical, 
psychological, financial, social, economic, or legal) or increased risk for the subject or others

 (including individuals who are not research subjects). These include: ( 1) death; (2) life 
threatening adverse experience; (3) hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] - inpatient, new, or prolonged; (4) 
disability/incapacity - persistent or significant; (5) birth defect/anomaly; (6) breach of confidentiality and (7) other problems, events, or new information (i.e. publications, DSMB reports, interim findings, product labeling change) that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_14846], safety, or welfare of the subjects or others, or substantially compromise the research data, AND  
• Unanticipated: (i.e. unexpected) problems or events are those that are not already described 
as potential risks in the protocol, consent document, not listed in the Investigator’s Brochure, or not part of an underlying disease. A problem or event is "unanticipated" when it was unforeseeable at the time of its occurrence. A problem or event is "unanticipated" when it occurs at an increased frequency or at an increased severity than expected, AND  
• Related : A problem or event is "related" if it is possibl y related to the research procedures.  
 
Adverse Event  
An untoward or undesirable experience associated with the use of a medical product (i.e. drug, 
device, biologic) in a patient or research subject.  Adverse events are classified as serious or non -
serious. 
Serious Adverse Event  
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered "serious" if, in the view of either the 
investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
• death  
• Is considered a life -threatening adverse event   
• inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_158979]  
• a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal 
life functions 
• a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6721], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the 
patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed in this definition.  
 All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious , should be regarded as non- serious 
adverse events .  
 
Adverse Event Reporting Period  
 
For this study, the study treatment follow -up period is defined as t hree ( 3) days following the last 
administration of study treatment, based on 2 hour half- life of  EPI.

 A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  A preexisting condition should 
be recorded as an adverse event if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the condition worsens during the study period.  
General Physical Examination Findings 
At screening, any clinically significant abnormality should be recorded as a preexisting condition.  
At the  end of the study, any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities that meet the definition 
of an adverse event must also be recorded and documented as an adverse event.  
 
Post-study Adverse Event  
All unresolved adverse events should be followed by t he sponsor-investigator until the events are 
resolved, the subject is lost to follow-up, or the adverse event is otherwise explained.  At the last scheduled visit, the sponsor-investigator should instruct each subject to report, to the sponsor-investigator  any subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the subject’s personal physician, b elieves 
might reasonably be related to participation in this study.   
 
Abnormal Laboratory Values 
A laboratory abnormality should be documented as an adverse event if the laboratory value remains 
outside of the normal range on repeat testing and the subject’s personal physician or PI, believe might reasonably be related  to study medication.  If the subject’s personal physician or PI [INVESTIGATOR_705334]/clinically significant, the study treatment might be discontinued. If 
the laboratory abnormality is considered treatable, it will be treated appropriately. The laboratory abnormality will be followed until it normalizes or no longer is considered unsafe and needing a follow up.

IRB.  
8.3.2 Sponsor -Investigator reporting: Notifying the FDA 
The sponsor- investigator will report all unexpected, serious suspected adverse reactions to the FDA 
according to the required IND Safety Reporting timelines, formats and requirements.  
 Unexpected fatal or life threatening suspected adverse reactions where there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study drug/placebo and the adverse event, will be reported as a serious suspected adverse reaction.  This will be reported to the FDA on FDA Form 3500A, no later than 7 calendar days after the sponsor- investigator’s initial receipt of the information about the 
event.  
 Other unexpected serious suspected adverse reactions where there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study drug/placebo and the adverse event, will be reported as a serious suspected adverse reaction.  This will be reported to the FDA on FDA Form 3500A, no later than 15 calendar days a fter the sponsor-investigator’s initial receipt of the information about the event. 
 Any clinically important increase in the rate of serious suspected adverse reactions over those listed in the protocol or product insert will be reported as a serious suspected adverse reaction.  This will be reported to the FDA on FDA Form 3500A no later than 15 calendar days after the sponsor-investigator’s initial receipt of the information about the event.  
 Findings from other studies in human or animals that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug will be reported.  This will be reported to the FDA on FDA Form 3500A, no later than 15 calendar days after the sponsor- investigators initial receipt of the information about the event.

Friedreich Ataxia Rating Scale (FARS) 
 
Availability: The  instrument  is  freely  available  here:  http://www.ataxia-study- 
group.net/ html/about /ataxiascale s/fars 
Classification: Core 
Short Description 
of Inst rument: The Friedreich Ataxia  Rating Scale  (FARS) is made up of a measure of ataxia,  an 
activities of daily living subs cale and a neurolog ical s ubscale.  This scale also i ncludes 
the 8m walk at maximum speed (8M W), the 9-hole  peg test (9HPT), and low-contr ast 
letter acuit y.  
Strengths: FARS scores corre late significa ntly with f unctional d isability, acti vities of 
daily living scores and dis ease du ration.  FA RS h as a lar ge effect size and requ ires fewer 
patients for an e quivalently  powere d study.  
Wea knesses: This scale captures a particular dimension of neurolog ic function in FA , 
so as a composite  measure, it is not good enoug h to pre dict d isease stat us. 
Scoring: The scores from the three subscales  are added to generate a total score ranging from 0 to 
159, with a hi gher score i ndicati ng a greater level of disa bility.  
Functional Staging for Ataxia subscale sco ring: 0 = Norm al - 6.0 = Confi ned to 
wheelc hair or bed with  total depe ndency for all A DL. Total  disability.  
ADL subsc ale sco ring: 9 items scored from 0 to  4.  
Neurolog ical Examinat ion sub scale scori ng: 5 items scored from 0 to 2 or 0 to 5, 
depending on the spe cific parame ter.

  Scoring: Both the dominant and non-dominant hands are tested twice within a 
single testing session. T he total  time to comple te the t ask is recorded. T he sco re for the 9-
HPT is  an average of t he four trials.  The two trials  for e ach hand are  averaged, con verted 
to the re ciprocals of the mea n times for each hand an d then the two re ciprocals are 
averaged. T his score  can be used individu ally or use d as part of the M SFC composi te 
score.  
Backgr ound :  The 9-HPT is  a brief, stand ardized, quantitati ve te st of upper extr emity 
function. It  is the se cond component of the M SFC to be adminis tered at  each visit. Both 
the do minant and non-dominant ha nds are tested twice. Two c onsecu tive trials  with the 
dominant hand are  immediately followed by [CONTACT_184665] o consec utive trials  with the non-dominant 
hand. 
Psychometric 
Propertie s: Strengths/Wea knesses:  There has been increasing recognition of the usefulness of  
measuri ng arm and hand f unction in cli nical st udies. The 9-HPT is one of t he mo st 
frequen tly used measures o f upper  extremity funct ion in MS. I t is responsive to changes 
at the upp er level of pe rformance but not whe n impair ment is  severe.  
Psyc hometric Pr operties: The 9-HPT has hig h inter-rate r reliability and good test -
retest re liability. The re is evidence for concu rrent and c onvergent v alidity as well as 
sensiti vity to dete ct minor impai rments  of hand fun ction.  P erformance  on the 9-Hole  
Peg Test may be sensiti ve to practice effects, that is, patie nts often display poore r 
performance  whe n first tested due to la ck of fa miliarity wi th the task.  It is recommended 
that three or four adminis trations be gi ven prior to a baseline assess ment if accu rate 
(rather than comparative ) assessmen ts of change ove r time are n eeded.  
Admi nistration :  The 9HPT is  adminis tered in person by a t rained examiner, who need 
not be a physician or nu rse. Adminis tration time v aries depe nding upon t he ab ility of

Scoring:  Scoring: Charts are scored based on the number of letters identified correctly.  
This format provides continuous scoring and may allow Sloan charts to capture losses 
of contrast at small letter sizes.  
 
Background: Low contrast acuity testing provides information on patient- reported 
aspects of vision. This testing is performed using low -contrast Sloan letter charts. Each 
chart corresponds to a different contrast level (shade of gray letters on 
white/retroilluminated background).

Psychometric  
Properties: Strengths/ Weakne sses: Sloan charts have a standardized format based on  
Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study visual acuity charts, which are the standard used for ophthalmology clinical trials. 
 
Psychometric Properties: Inter -rater agreement was described with the intraclass 
correlation coefficient (ICC) and comparison of mean scores. Excellent inter -rater 
agreement (ICC=0.86 -0.95) was demonstrated at each contrast level among MS 
patients (n=100) and visually- asymptomatic volunteers (n=33). Ave rage letter scores at 
the lowest contrast level (0.6%) were highly variable in the MS group, even among 
patients with visual acuities of 20/20 or better, and among those who required no 
assistance for ambulation.

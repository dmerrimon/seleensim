Protocol Ve rsion #: 2  3 
Protocol Date:  April 2020 1.0 Background  
 
The prevalence of he art fail ure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is compara ble 
to that of heart failure  with r educed ejection fraction (HFrEF) , carries a simil arly grim 
prognosis [1], and there are no effective disease -modifying medical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] [2-5].  A 
common and diagnostic characteristic of HFpEF is dyspnea in response to physiologic 
stress, such as exercise, that can correlate with increased left-sided filli ng pressure as 
measured by [CONTACT_72315] [6-7].  While definitive, this modality is not 
practical to apply widely in clinical practice and remains challenging to pursue even for 
research  studies that aim to evaluate  underlying  physiologi c mechanisms and resp onses 
to treatment.  Therefore, a  non-invasive approach to estimating left -sided filling 
pressure  post-exercise would be helpful in this regard.  St andard tis sue Doppler imaging  
on echocard iograp hy (i.e. E/e ’), which can be helpful a t rest to estimate pulmonary 
arterial wedge pressure (PAWP) [8], may be less accurate  due to fusion of E and A 
waves  at the higher heart rates expected post -exercise.  
 
Prior work using echocardiographic contrast to der ive pulmonary transit time ( PTT) has 
suggested that a related metric, pulmon ary blood volu me (PBV) , correlates with PA WP 
at rest  [9-12; IRB # 110362, #131075, #131355 ].  The current study proposes to 
measur e PTT and PBV post -exercise .  Demonstration o f technical plausibility of this 
approach would justify future studies to compare  directly  echocardiographically -derived 
PBV and invasive exerc ise hem odynamics  post-exercise .  If P BV were shown to be a 
reasonable  surrogate for PAWP with exercise , the capab ility to study the defining feature 
of HFpEF  could be expan ded to a non-invasive  technique .  
 
2.[ADDRESS_1080844] a feasibility study to achieve th e following  
aims:  
 
1. Record the flow of ultrasound contrast across the pulmonar y circulation after a 
standardized exercise pro tocol 
2. Compare PTT a nd PBV pre- and post-exercise in th e same cohort  
3. Comp are the time  from contrast administration to appearance in the right -heart 
pre- and post -exercise (i .e. vein -to-heart time)  
4. Compare PTT obtained by [CONTACT_785747] -intensity curves to the PTT estimate 
obtained by  [CONTACT_55799]

Laboratories worldwide, including at VUMC.  
 
4.0 Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria  
Protocol Ve rsion #: 2  4 
Protocol Date:  April [ADDRESS_1080846] meet all the following criteria : 
 
Inclusion Criteria:  
 
1. Age ≥ 18 ye ars old   
2. Able to give informed consent  
 
To be eligible for enrollment, patients cannot meet any of the followi ng criteria : 
 
Exclusion criteria:  
 
1. Known allergic reaction to Definity  or Optison ultrasound contrast  
2. Pregnancy/Nursin g – as assessed/ disclosed by [CONTACT_2299]  
3. Any faculty/staff whose performance will be directly and formally evaluated by 
[CONTACT_9940] -investigators  
 
5.0 Enrollment/Random ization  
 
As this study is limited  in size and aims to evaluate PTT post -exercise, we will 
concent rate enroll ment efforts towards  a focused  group of prospective participa nts with 
(self-reported) ad equate e xercise c apacity.  Namely,  the focus will be on individuals that 
attend conf erences /meetings  given by [CONTACT_785748]  (i.e. some fo rm of a erobic exercise at least 
twice per month) .  This gro up includes faculty, sonographers , administ rators, support 
staff, and occasiona l guests from other department s (particularl y for inter-disciplinary 
conferences).  Within this pool o f potential candidates, there is suffici ent demographic 
diversity to be permit inclusion of individuals across a range of a ge, gender, a nd 
ethnicity.   Cardiology fellows and NPs are not el igible to avoid the appear ance of undue 
influence  to participate . 
 
Invitations to parti cipate in the  study will be made to those in attendance at divisional 
conferences (i.e. Faculty Meeting, Echocardiograph y confe rence) and will not target 
specific in dividuals within the above grou ps.  Interested individuals will contact [CONTACT_144052], who 
will then hel p facilitate the study visit at the CRC.  
 
6.[ADDRESS_1080847] o ver a single day during a single visit to the CRC.  
Participa nts w ill expe rience the following:  
 
1. Basel ine demo graphics and anth ropomorphic measureme nts.  Basic 
information on age, gender , and self -identified ethnicity will be collected along 
with height and weight . 
2. Pre-exercise echocardiog raphic e valuation .  This assessm ent will  be 
performed by [CONTACT_785749] r and will include heart rate, LVOT dia meter, 
LVOT VTI, mitral valve inflow, mitral valve  tissue Doppl er imaging, IVC 
size/respi[INVESTIGATOR_785741] , and a recording of the api[INVESTIGATOR_2855] 4 -chamber 
Protocol Ve rsion #: 2  5 
Protocol Date:  April 2020 view (the view in which contrast flow will be  record ed) to ensure adequate 
visualization . 
3. Pre-exer cise PTT m easurement .  Following p lacement of a standard 
periph eral IV by a CRC nu rse, ultrasound contrast will be admi nistered and the 
pathway  of the  contrast from entry in to the ri ght-heart through app earance  in 
the left -heart will be recorded in order t o obtain t he data necessary  to measure 
PTT.  The interval betwe en the begin ning of th e contra st injection and the 
appearan ce in the right -heart will b e recorded.   The IV line will th en be flushed 
with sa line to remove any residual contrast.   After the  acquisition of  these data, 
the ‘FLASH ’ feature of the ul trasound ma chine will be employed to ra pi[INVESTIGATOR_785742] , 
if any, residual contrast  when it is time for administration of contrast post -
exercise.  
4. Exercise pro tocol .  Participants will exercise on a treadmill (provided by [CONTACT_785750]) following a Standard Bruce Protocol until the ir heart rate reaches 
~ 2.5 -times their baseline leve l or until they reach maximum effort.  Exercise 
capacity, blood  pressure, and heart rate  will be re corded at standar d intervals 
throughout exerc ise.  If it proves to be  more logistically  favorable , an exercise 
bicycle (also s upplied by  [CONTACT_785751]) can be used rather than a treadmill .  
5. Post -exercise P TT measure ment .  This administration of contrast will be 
similar to th e pre-exercise PTT measu rement  and will occur as soon as an 
adequate echocardiog raphic image can be obtained following exerc ise.  Heart 
rate will also be re corded during this step.   Mitral valve i nflow, mitral valve  tissue 
Doppler imaging, and IVC size/respi[INVESTIGATOR_785743]-
asses sed as well.   
6. Contingencies  for additional contrast administra tion.  Should there be 
unforeseen  technical issues with contrast administrati on or imag e acquisition at  
pre- or post -exerci se, additional d oses of contrast can be given as permitted by 
[CONTACT_785752] (typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], [ADDRESS_1080848]).  
 
7.[ADDRESS_1080849], and treadmill/ stationary bicycle exercise.  
 
The risk s associated with periphe ral IV placement include damage to the  vein, 
inadverte nt arteria l punc ture, in fection, and infiltration into the und erlying skin.  In 
general , and in this setting in part icular (i.e. non -acutely i ll individuals having an IV 
placed by [CONTACT_785753] d nurse) , complications of peripheral  IV placement  are rare. 
 
The safety record of Defini ty and Optison ultrasound contrast, the two agents approved 
for clinical use in the [LOCATION_002], is long -established and has been presented in prior 
protocols cited above.  In  summary, studies reporting on hundre ds of thousands of 
adminis tered doses have  shown extremely low adverse event r ates. 
 
Specifically, with Definity, serious cardiopulmonary reactions (including fatalities) have 
occurred during or fol lowing administration ; most serious reactions occur within 30 
Protocol Ve rsion #: 2  6 
Protocol Date:  April 2020 minutes of a dministration.  These include :  Cardiovascular: Flushing (1%) C entral 
nervous system: Headache (2%) Gastrointestinal: Nausea (1%) Neuromuscular & 
skeletal: Back pain (1%) Renal: Rena l pain (1%).  
 
Specifi cally, with Optison, serious cardiopulmonary reaction s (some fatal) have occurred 
uncommonly during or within 30 min utes following administration. Serious anaphylactoid 
reaction. Cardiovascular: Flushing (4%), chest pain (1%) Central n ervous system: 
Headac he (5%), dizziness (3%), chills (≤1%), fatigue (≤1%),  malaise (≤1%) 
Gastrointestinal: Nausea (≤4%), vomiting (≤4%), dysgeusia (2%) Local: Discomfort at 
injection site (1%) Neuromuscular & skeletal: Weakness (≤1%) Respi[INVESTIGATOR_696]: Dyspnea 
(1%), flu -like symptom s (1%) Miscellaneous: Fever (≤1% ). 
 
The risks a ssociat ed with exercise  on the trea dmill ( Standard Bruce Pr otocol) or exercise 
bicycle include mechanical injury (from loss of balance or equipment failure) , 
muscle/joint pain , orthopedic injury,  and unanticip ated cardiac events (i.e. triggerin g of 
acute coronary syn drome  or arrhythmias ).  In the popula tion targeted for this study,  
these risks are anticipated to be small. 
 
8.0 Reportin g of Adverse Eve nts or Unanticipated Problems involving Risk 
to Participants or O thers  
 
Adverse events determined to be related to the stud y will be repo rted to  the VUMC IRB 
by [CONTACT_785754] [INVESTIGATOR_785744].L within 7 calendar days of the 
PI's knowledge of the problem.  
 
9.0 Study Withdrawal/Disco ntinua tion 
 
Patients who wish to be withdrawn from the study for any reason wil l notify the P I or 
other study pers onnel.  Patient data that have not been used or analyzed prior to this 
notification will b e deleted from the REDCap database.  
 
10.0  Statistical Con sidera tions  
 
As there are no current data on (or estimates of) the differences in PTT between  rest 
and exercise, there is  no formal po wer calculati on to determine sample size.  We will 
aim for a cohort of  15 participants , realizin g that there may be a ‘lea rning curve’ that 
could render  data from the i nitial participants unable to be used in quanti tative analyses.   
 
The prim ary analysis will consist of an intra -individual  comparison  of pre- and post -
exerci se PTT and PBV .  As these will be paired o bservation s that will likely no t be 
normally distributed, th e Wilcoxon matched -pairs sign ed rank test w ill be used for this 
evaluation.  Similar methodology will be used to ana lyze the vein -to-heart times pre - 
and post-exercise.  Bland -Altman analysis will be used t o compare PTT obtaine d by [CONTACT_785755] ( intensity-time curves and visual assessme nt).

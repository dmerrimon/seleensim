16. Provide  a summary of  any recent  findings,  literature,  or other  relevant  information  (especially 
pertaining  to risks),  if applicable.  
Of the 238 subjects  with usable data,  QuantaFlo  detected  positive  results  for Peripheral  Artery 
Disease in 44 subjects:  10 with  severe,  15 with  moderate,  and 19 with  mild disease.  Of the 10 
designated  severe by [CONTACT_687903],  8 were confirmed  upon follow -up exams and imaging (positive 
predictive  value of  67%).  Of those  34 designated  mild or moderate  by [CONTACT_687903],  2 were 
confirmed  upon follow -up exams and imaging (positive  predictive  value of  14%).  
 
 
17. Have there  been any significant  amendments  or revisions to  the N 
protocol  during the  past approval period? (Significant  amendments  
include changes in study  design or risk level including those  that 
resulted  in a change in consent).  
If yes, please briefly  summarize the  changes:  
 
 
18. Y  
The consent materials attached to this eIRB application (including consent documents, assent 
documents, recruitment statements or other materials used to obtain consent) are the  
versions being used in the conduct of this study and all enrolled subjects hav e signed consent 
forms on file, if required. (If the requirement to obtain consent was waived or if no participants 
have enrolled since last continuing review, check N/A).  
 NOTE: The IRB routinely monitors consent document usage and may request copi[INVESTIGATOR_687875].  
 
19. Are any changes (amendments)  requested  with this Continuing  Review?  
Y Yes, please complete  the remainder of  this form.  
No, form is complete.  Please  submit.  
 
20. Summarize  the proposed changes to  the protocol  in lay terms,  including the  type of change AND  
what  the change involves.  
 
If this is a change in PI  a new  Department  Chair review is required.  Please  upload the  signed 
document  in the  Attachments  section.  
We would like to  increase the  sample size from  400 to  750. This change involves using the  same 
protocol  on additional  subjects  by [INVESTIGATOR_1312] -instituting  the workflow  at screening locations.  We are also 
adding a study  team  member,  Scott  Wilson -Flewelling.  
 
 
21. Provide  justification/explanation  for the proposed changes.  
Given  the low PPV  of QuantaFlo,  and considering the  manufacturing  company has different 
results,  we would like to  continue  the study  and increase enrollment  to increase the  power of  our 
analysis.  
 
 
22. Will currently  accrued subjects  need to  be notified  of changes?  N 
If no, please justify  why not.

Peripheral  artery  disease (PAD)  affects  8–18 million in the  US and is an economic burden, 
currently  estimated  to be greater  than cancer and heart  disease.  Older  age (>  65 years), 
smoking,  diabetes  and kidney diseases are some risk factors  associated  with PAD and are 
known to  have increased morbidity  and mortality[1,  2]. PAD progression directly  results  in 
claudication,  impaired walking,  and amputation.  Amputation  is not  benign - impacts  are physical 
and emotional.  Recovery from  amputation  involves long -term rehabilitation.  The American  
Heart  Association  (AHA)  in 2016 guidelines suggests  an algorithm  for diagnosis and 
management  of PAD.  They  recommend a collaborative  multidisciplinary  team  approach 
between  the primary care physician and specialists  including;  a diabetologists/  endocrinologist, 
smoking cessation  expert,  hypertension  and lipid specialist,  interventional  radiologist,  vascular 
surgeon,  orthopedist,  neurologist,  wound healing expert,  and/or  others  for ‘the greatest  chance 
of providing optimal  care for  the patient  with PAD’[3].  
 
Early  detection  is critical  for mitigating  PAD progression.  Ankle -brachial  index (ABI)  testing  is 
recommended by [CONTACT_687906][3].  ABI testing  is especially useful  in primary care 
settings  allowing for  earlier diagnosis and treatment.  Several  ABI methods  are used;  classically 
this test uses a device for  measuring blood pressure with  an inflatable  cuff, and blood pressure 
measurements  are taken  at the upper arm and the  ankle;  healthcare  providers have used a 
doppler probe to  detect  audible systolic  pressure signals within  the arteries  - Doppler ABI. 
Barriers  to implementation  include;  time required to  conduct  tests,  training  and required 
technical  skills.  Hence,  Doppler -based ABI  in primary care has been limited.  Recently  designed 
oscillometric  (manual or digital  with automatic  electronic  calculation  of blood pressure) and  
photophlethysmographic  devices are now available.  However current  guidelines do not  endorse 
the use of  these  newer devices but  recommend the  hand -held doppler technique[4].  
 
Digital  ABI is noninvasive,  automated  ABI using pulsatile  blood volume changes - 
plethysmography,  irrespective  of vessel compressibility.  The QuantaFlo™  (Semler  Scientific, 
Inc.) is an innovative,  510K  FDA approved device that  provides bilateral,  non-invasive 
physiologic studies  of upper and lower extremity  arteries  using volume plethysmography  of the 
posterior  tibial and anterior  tibial/dorsalis  pedis arterial  distributions.  QuantaFlo™  uses an 
optical  sensor attached  onto a digit  in the  hand and feet  to assess extremity  blood volume.  It 
then displays a signal,  directly  related  to blood volume,  on a Volume  Plethysmography  Chart 
used to  calculate  PAD probability.  This test is easy to  use and portable,  delivering fast, 
accurate  results  in ~5  minutes;  an attractive  option  in primary care settings.  While  maintaining 
accuracy,  results  comparing digital  methods  to Doppler show concordance above 90%.  The 
American  Medical Association  (AMA)  concluded,  “Evaluation  of the digits  in both  legs with  
volume plethysmography  is appropriate  for this code provided that  an ankle/brachial  index (ABI)  
be performed.”  QuantaFlo™  meets  both of these  standards.  
 
ABI ≤ 0.9 has been used as the  criterion  for diagnosing PAD  based on ACC/AHA  guidelines for 
the management  of patients  with PAD [3]; the cutoff  value of  ABPI  ≤0.9 it has been reported  
that the sensitivity  of diagnosing PAD  was 83% to  85% and a specificity  of 95% to  100% [5].  ABI 
has been validated  against  lower extremity  contrast  angiography obtaining  high sensitivity (85% –
95%) and specificity  (90% –100%),  for diagnosing PAD [6, 7]. Many studies  have reported more 
than 95% of  sensitivity  and specificity  of colour duplex ultrasound  scan in detecting  a significant  
stenosis  of the arteries  [8, 9].

QuantaFlo™  (Semler  Scientific,  Inc.) is a novel,  noninvasive,  510K  FDA approved digital  device 
that is used as a screening tool  to measure ABI  of patients  at risk of  PAD.  This single center 
prospective  clinical trial  will evaluate  the sensitivity  and specificity  of digital  ABI in detecting  
PAD using color Doppler ultrasound  and ‘gold standard’  angiography as reference.  Specifically 
in participant  undergoing dialysis and who cannot  undergo ABI  using pressure cuffs  dialysis 
grafts/  fistulae  in the  arms,  we will evaluate  the value of  digital  ABI in detecting  PAD.

b) List your research objectives  (specific  aims &  hypotheses  of the study).  
Primary  aim: 
To evaluate  the sensitivity  and specificity  of digital  ABI in diagnosing PAD  using color Doppler  
ultrasound  and ‘gold standard’  angiography as reference.  
Secondary  aim: 
•To correlate  the digital  ABI index with  symptoms  of PAD.  
•To evaluate  the value of  digital  ABI in detecting  PAD in patients  on dialysis in whom the  
presence of  dialysis grafts/  fistulae  in the  arms would have prohibited  the use of  ABI using  
pressure cuffs.

which are standard  of care.  Please  note:  The box below is for  text only.  If you would like to  add 
tables,  charts,  etc., attach  those  files in the  Attachment  section  (#16).  
1.Screening  sites:  The digital  ABI screening test  will be offered  at various outpatient  clinics in 
departments  belonging to  family  medicine,  endocrinology,  geriatric  medicine.  
 
2.Participant  information:  Participant  will get  information  about  Peripheral  arterial  disease based 
on a poster  which will be placed in the  waiting  areas as well as flyers  that will be presented  to 
them  during their  routine  clinic visit  to the respective  specialists.  
3.Screening  questionnaire:  On registration  at these  respective  clinics,  all patients  in the  clinic  
will be given the  screening questionnaire  by [CONTACT_687907].  Patient  will fill  out the questionnaire,  
saying YES  or NO.  If ANY of the questions  is a YES  - this is an indication  for doing a screening  
digital  ABI. 
The screening questionnaire  is considered part  of clinical care,  and would occur regardless of  
this research study.  
 
4.If ANY of the questions  is a YES  - this is an indication  for doing a screening digital  ABI. This 
patient  will then  be approached by [CONTACT_687908].  The Research Coordinator  will then  consent  the patient  for the study.  
 
5. After  consent,  an EPIC  order will be placed for  the ABI. The medical assistant  / nurse/  front 
desk will speak to  the study  coordinator  to put an order for  a digital  ABI in EPIC.  Along  with the 
order,  the answers from  the screening questionnaire  will be entered  into EPIC  via a flowsheet 
that has been created.  The screening questionnaire  will be uploaded in EPIC  regardless of  this 
research study.  
6.Perform  Digital  ABI: 
Performing  ABI is within  the normal duties  of any nurse/  medical assistant  
 
•Will be performed  by [CONTACT_687909]/medical  assistant/  research coordinator  with training  to perform 
this test 
•The participant  will be placed in the  supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547],  with the arms and legs at  the same level 
as the  heart,  for a minimum of  5 minutes  before  measurement.  Foot warmers will be placed 
during this  time on the  patients  feet with foot liners.  The foot warmers are like a heating  pad for 
feet. 
•The optical  sensor (similar to  a pulse oximeter)  will be placed sequentially  in the fingers  of the 
hands and feet:  Right  and left  hand fingers  and then  right and left  feet toes.  
•Usually each digit  takes  about  15 seconds to  obtain  a waveform  
•At the end of  60 seconds,  an automated  digital  ABI will be generated.

compared to  a placebo group or comparison treatment  group,  what  are the  guidelines or 
endpoints  by [CONTACT_687911]? For 
example,  it may be reasonable to  stop enrollment  on a study  when efficacy  has already been 
clearly demonstrated,  to avoid unnecessary enrollments  of additional  subjects.  Alternatively,  it 
may be reasonable to  stop enrollment  when it  is clear that  efficacy  will never be demonstrated, 
given the  statistical  power of  the study  as designed.  Describe the  guidelines that  are in place to 
assist  in making these  determinations,  if relevant  to the proposed study.  
N/A 
 
 
d) Describe how data  analysis will be performed  (statistical  tests,  methods  of evaluating  data)  and 
indicate  the smallest  group/unit  for which separate  reporting  will occur.  For studies  involving a 
questionnaire,  if data and reliability  information  are available,  please describe or provide 
references.  For full board,  unfunded  studies  describe sample size determination  and power 
analysis.  If none,  please justify.  
Statistical  analysis will be performed  using R version 3.3.2  or newer (R Core Team,  Vienna, 
Austria).Binary  variables will created  for each sign,  symptom,  or risk factor  based on the 
corresponding questionnaire  response.  Standard  summary statistics  will be calculated  for study 
variables of  interest.  For continuous  variables,  statistics  included the  number of  observations 
(N), mean,  standard  deviation,  and 95% confidence  interval.  Categorical  variables will be 
summarized in frequency  distributions.  The results  of ABI will be categorized  based on the  ABI 
index obtained  as normal (>0.9),  calcified  arteries  (>1.4),  Mild to  moderate  disease (0.4 -0.9), 
Severed  disease - <0.4 and compared to  symptoms  (e.g. asymptomatic,  claudication,  critical 
limb ischemia).  A ‘Positive  ABI’ will then  be compared to  gold standard  ‘angiography’;  if 
angiography shows evidence of  PAD,  this will be termed  ‘angiographic positive’.  Sensitivity  will 
be defined  as the  proportion  of ‘ABI positive  results’  out of the number of  samples which were 
actually  ‘angiographically positive’.  When  there  are no positive  results,  sensitivity  will not  be 
defined  and a value of  NA is returned.  Similarly,  when there  are no negative  results,  specificity 
will not  defined  and a value of  NA is returned.  Similar  statements  will be true  for predictive 
values.  The positive  predictive  value will be defined  as the  percent  of predicted  positives  that are 
actually  positive  while the  negative  predictive  value will be defined  as the  percent  of negative  
positives  that are actually  negative.

e) State  if deception  (including incomplete  disclosure of  study  purpose/procedures)  will be used.  If 
so, describe the  nature  of the deception  and provide a rationale  for its use. Also,  describe 
debriefing  procedures or justify  a waiver of  the requirement  to debrief.  NOTE:  for studies  using 
deception,  an alteration  of consent  must  be justified  in the  Informed  Consent  section  of the 
protocol  (#13) and  the debriefing  script/statement  must  be uploaded in the  Attachments  section

f) Is there  an accepted  standard  of care and/or  standard  practice  at SLU for the Y 
condition/disease/situation  being studied?  This information  will assist  in comparing  
the risk/benefit  ratio of study  procedures relevant  to usual care that  would be  
received outside  of the research context.  *?HELP?*  
 
If yes, please describe the  standard  of care and standard  practice  at SLU for the 
condition/disease/situation  being studied.  
Several  ABI methods  are used,  with Doppler ABI  being most  common.  
 
Currently  at Saint  Louis University  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307],  patients  who have signs and symptoms  of PAD 
undergo traditional  ABI or Doppler ultrasound.  Traditional  ABI involves a slightly  different 
process involving the  use of  blood pressure cuffs  and manual measurement  of flow using 
Doppler.  Some  patient  may also receive angiography,  which involves am injection  of a dye into 
the artery  of the leg to  evaluate  for blocks in arteries.  
 
 
g) Does this  study  involve any diagnostic  imaging,  labwork or genetic  testing  that could  Y 
result  in clinical discovery (diagnoses,  genetic  mutations,  etc.)?  Note  that this could 
include discovery that  is expected  (related  to the research) or incidental  (not related  
to research aims,  but possible,  like a mass/shadow  found  in imaging despi[INVESTIGATOR_687881]). 
 
 
If yes, please describe and include whether  there  are plans to  share findings  with study 
participants.  
Yes we may discover the  participant  has an undiagnosed PAD.  This information  will be shared 
with the subjects.  
 
 
h) Is this study  subject  to the NIH Genomic  Data  Sharing  Policy?  N 
 
The NIH GDS  policy applies to  all NIH -funded  research that  generates  large -scale 
human genomic data  as well as the  use of  these  data for subsequent  research and 
includes:  genome -wide association  studies  (GWAS),  single nucleotide

There  is no research that  can be considered totally  risk free  (e.g.,  a potential  risk of  breach of 
confidentiality).  Therefore,  when describing the  risk, the lowest  level of  risk is "no  more than  minimal risk".

11. Data  Safety  Monitoring  
Federal  regulations  require that  when appropriate,  the research protocol  makes adequate  provisions 
for monitoring  the data to ensure the  safety  of participants.  Monitoring  should be commensurate  with 
risks and with  the size and complexity  of the research,  and could range from  no plan needed to  an 
independent  data safety  monitoring  board.  Please  refer to SLU Guidelines  for Data  and Safety 
Monitoring  as you complete  the questions  below.  
 
 
 
a. Is there a Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) or Board (DSMB)?  N/A 
 
 
If yes, please provide the  following  information  (labeled a -g): a) the composition  of the board 
(degrees/qualifications  of members),  b)  whether  the board is independent  from the sponsor and 
research team  or not,  c)  frequency  of meetings  and issuance of  reports  to sites,  d) assurance that 
the board is reviewing aggregate  safety  data and making recommendations  regarding study 
continuance,  e)  provisions for  ad hoc meetings  if needed,  f) who is reviewing SAEs  in real time  (MD 
or DO),  and  g)  stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]/halting  rules (if  any exist).  
A DSM  charter  can be referenced  for all items  except  for "f) who is  reviewing SAEs  in real time."  
 
 
If no, please justify  why not.  
 
 
 
 
 
Is there a Data Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP)?  N/A 
b. 
 
 
Note,  if all relevant  plan information  is included in DSMB  question  above,  select  'Yes'  and state  "see 
above"  in the  answer box.  
 
 
 
 
 
If yes, provide details  (labeled a -e) including:  a) what  types  of data or events  are captured  and how are 
they documented,  b)  who is monitoring  data,  their independence/affiliation  with the research and their 
degrees/qualifications,  c)  frequency  of aggregate  data review,  d) who is reviewing SAEs  in real time 
(MD or DO),  and  e)  stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]/halting  rules (if  any exist).  
 
 
If no, please justify  why not.  
 
 
 
 
 
12. In case of  international  research (research outside  of the U.S. or research on international populations  
(non-U.S.)),  describe qualifications/preparations  that enable you to  evaluate  cultural appropriateness  
and estimate/minimize  risks to  subjects.  Include  whether  research is sensitive  given cultural  norms.

10. Benefits/Alternatives  
a) Benefits.  Describe the  potential  benefit(s)  to be gained by [CONTACT_687927]/or  society  in general.  Indicate  if there  is no direct  benefit  to the 
participants.  
Early  detection  is critical  for mitigating  PAD progression.  Ankle -brachial  index (ABI)  testing  is 
recommended by [CONTACT_687928]. ABI testing  is especially useful  in primary care settings  allowing for  earlier  
diagnosis and treatment.  Several  ABI methods  are used,  with Doppler ABI  being most  common.  Barriers  to 
implementation  include;  time required to  conduct  tests,  training  and required technical  skills.  Hence, 
Doppler -based ABI  in primary care has been limited.  Participants  may benefit  if PAD is detected  and is  
able to  be treated  early.  
Participants  may also not  receive any direct  benefits.  
 
 
b) Alternatives.  Describe any alternative  treatments  and procedures available to  the subjects  should they 
choose not  to participate  in the  study.  If no such alternatives  exist,  please state  that the alternative  is 
nonparticipation.  For some studies,  such as record reviews,  a description  of alternatives  would not  be 
applicable.  
Participants  can choose the  current  standard  PAD evaluation  methods.This  includes in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_687889].  
 
 
11. Procedures to Maintain Confidentiality and Privacy  
 
 
Federal  regulations  require that  research materials  be kept  for a minimum of  three  (3) years and HIPAA 
documents  be kept  for a minimum of  six (6) years after  the closure of  the study.  For FDA-regulated  or 
sponsored projects,  the PI [INVESTIGATOR_687890] a longer time  period.

An informed  consent  will be obtained  by [CONTACT_687932].  
 
The digital  ABI we are offering  can be performed  right at the time of the patients  visit to the physician 
(for the unrelated  condition,  e.g. [CONTACT_687952] jane visiting  [CONTACT_687953] for  diabetes,  but filling  the 
questionnaire  and needing an ABI  for detecting  APD).  It does not  involve making a new appointment 
for the test, and could save the  participant  time and  travel  in coming another  visit. The participant will 
be given ample time  to review the  consent  form,  but if he / she needs additional  time,  the participant  
can take  it home,  review it  and secure an appointment  for this test at another  day.

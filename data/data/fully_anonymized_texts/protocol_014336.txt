Study Treatment Ponatinib
Study Title A Randomized, Open -label, Phase 2 Trial of Ponatinib in Patients with Resistant 
Chro nic Phase Chronic Myeloid Leukemia to Characterize the Efficac y and Safety  
of a Range of Doses
Phase Phase 2
Eligible Population Patients with chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CP -CML) who have received 
at least two prior tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapi[INVESTIGATOR_381377] T315I mutation
Summary and Study 
RationalePonatinib is a novel, synthetic, orally active TKI specifically designed to optimally 
inhibit native BCR -ABL.  It is also active against mutated forms of the protein that 
can arise during treatment with other TKIs and cause resistance, including the T315I 
gatekeeper mutant.  The latter confers uniform resistance to all other available BCR -
ABL inhibitors ( e.g., imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib, and bosutinib).  Ponatinib 
(Iclusig®, ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ) is approved in the [LOCATION_002] (US) for 
the treatment of adult patients with chronic phase, accelerated phase, or blast phase 
chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) or Philadelphia chromosome positive acute 
lymphoblas tic leukemia ( Ph+ ALL) for whom no other TKI therapy is indicated and 
for treatment of adult patients with T315I -positive CML (chronic phase, accelerated 
phase, o r blast phase) or T315I -positive Ph+ ALL.   In the European Union (EU), 
ponatinib is approved f or the treatment of adult patients with CML ( chronic phase, 
accelerated phase, or blast phase ) and Ph+ ALL who are resistant to dasatinib (or 
nilotinib for CML), w ho are intolerant to dasatinib (or nilotinib for CML), and for 
whom subsequent treatment with imatinib is not clinically appropriate, or who have 
the T315I mutation.
The phase 2 clinical trial of ponatinib in patients with CML orPh+ ALL who have 
hadprior TKI therapy (AP24534 -10-201, PACE), which supported the drug’s 
approvals, tested a starting dose of [ADDRESS_477777] recent dasatinib or nilotinib therapy (55.4% vs. 25.8%) and 
85.7% remained in the primary endpoint for ≥[ADDRESS_477778] 
demonstrated a higher cumulative incidence of arterial occlusive events (including 
cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and peripheral vascular events) observed with a 
longer follow -up, than reported at the time of the initial approval.   Arterial occlusive 
events (AOEs) —including fatal myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, severe peripheral 
vascular disease, and the need for urgent revascularization procedures —have been 
reported in ponatinib -
treated patients.
Current data suggest that a dose -effect relatio nship exists with efficacy and with the

05October 2020 Page 8of 113occurrence of AOEs, and that a lower daily dose may reduce the incidence of AOEs .  
This clinical study will assess the relationships ofexposure with efficacy and safety: 
patients will receive a range of initial doses ,and at defined time poin ts, patients in 
response will undergo a dose reduction.  The goal of the study will thus be to 
understand induction of responses, maintenance of responses, safety, and exposure -
response as consequences of these dosing strategies.
The primary endpoint of th is study will be the achievement of ≤1% BCR -ABL1ISat 
[ADDRESS_477779] established by [CONTACT_381416] (IS) (Mar in, 2014 ; NCCN, 2014 ; Baccarani et al, 2013 ; Marin et 
al, 2012; Lauseker et al, 2012 ; Saglio et al, 2012 ).  
This trial is being conducted in fulfillment of a Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) post -
marketing requirement (PMR2113 -6).
Study Design This is a multi -center, randomized phase [ADDRESS_477780] 
CP-CML; have received at least [ADDRESS_477781] the T315I mutation.  
Patients w ill be randomized to receive once -daily  oral administration of 1 of 3 
starting doses of ponatinib: 45 mg (Cohort A), 30 mg (Cohort B), or 15 mg (Cohort 
C).  Patients starting at [ADDRESS_477782] their daily dose reduced to 15 mg 
upon achievement of ≤1% BCR -ABL1IS, as defined in Section 14.1.[ADDRESS_477783] of an initial 24 -cycle Main Treatment Period; additionally, the 
study includes an optional Treatment Continuation Period.  All randomized patients 
will enter the Main Treatment Period and will remain on treatment in the Main 
Treatment Period until the occurrence of at least one of the following: absence of 
complete hematologic response (CHR) by 3 months, absence of major cytogenetic 
response (MCyR) at 12 months, absenc e of ≤1% BCR -ABL1ISat 12 months, loss of 
≤1% BCR -ABL1ISasdefined in Section [IP_ADDRESS] , development of intolerance, or 
completion of all 24 cycl es of treatment (whichever occurs first). Patients who 
achieve ≤1% BCR -ABL1ISat any  time point undergo dose reduction, and then lose 
≤1% BCR -ABL1ISare candidates for dose re -escalatio n to their starting dose, as 
described in Section 14.1.4 .
Following completion of the 24- month Main Treatment Period or following early 
withdrawal from the Main Treatment Period befo re completing all 24 cycles of the 
Main Treatment Period, patients w ho are both tolerating ponatinib treatment and 
receiving clinical benefit from treatment may enter into an optional Treatment 
Continuation Period upon discussion and agreement between the investigator and 
medical monitor.  Examples of clinical benefit that could allow a patient to enter the 
Treatment Continuation Period include (but are not limited to) a reduction from 
baseline in BCR -ABLISlevels (but without meeting the protocol -defined r esponse 
criterion of ≤1% BCR -ABL1ISat 12 months), an improvement in hematologic 
parameters (but without meeting the protocol -defined response criterion of CHR by 
3 mo nths), o r a BCR -ABLISlevel indicative of clinical benefit (but that is > 1%, 
after loss of ≤1% BCR -ABL1ISat an earlier time point).  Each patient may remain 
on study  treatment during the Treatment Continuation Period until the patient stops 
receiving clinical benefit or experiences unacceptable toxicity, or until the study is 
terminated by [CONTACT_456] (whichever occurs first).  Section 12describes follow -up 
and data collection for such continuation patients.  Section 10.4 provides more detail 
about the study design including descriptions of the Main Treatment and Treatment

The trial will assess hematologic response, cytogenetic response, and molecular 
response—as well as characteristics of efficacy, including time to and duration of responses—both by [CONTACT_381417].  AE rates and the rates of AOEs and venous thrombotic/embolic events (VTEs), in particular, will be measured.  Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) data will also be collected and analyzed.  Assessments will be performed according to standard international criteria.  The duration of patient participation will vary by [CONTACT_381418].  Each dose cohort will be analyzed separately for efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics (PK).
Study Objectives Primary Objective:
To characterize the efficacy of ponatinib administered in 3 starting doses (45 mg, 
30 mg, and 15 mg daily) in patients with CP-CML who are resistant to prior TKI therapy or have T315I mutation, as measured by ≤1% BCR-ABL1
ISat 12 months.

Approximate Number of 
PatientsThe total enrollment will be 276 patients, with 92 (1:1:1) patients in each cohort. 
Approximate Duration of 
Patient Pa rticipationThe duration of patient participation will be approximately 24 months for all patients 
in the Main Treatment Period, with an option for patients completing or 
discontinuing from the Main Treatment Period who are still receiving clinical benefit
from treatment to enter a Treatment Continuation Period after discussion and 
agreement between the investigator and medical monitor.  Each patient will undergo 
a period of up to 3 weeks for screening prior to treatment. The duration of therapy 
will be det ermined by [CONTACT_6904]’s response and toxicity profile, and patients may 
remain on ponatinib in the study if the benefit -risk profile remains favorable.  
Patients will be followed for [ADDRESS_477793] 60 months, including 36 months for 
enrollment and 24 months of treatment/follow -up in the Main Treatment Period.  
The total duration of therapy, and therefore of the study, will be determined by [CONTACT_181456]’s response and toxicity profile; the study will continue until all patients have 
been discontinued from the study or the study is terminated by [CONTACT_456] 
(whichever occurs first).

05October 2020 Page 14of 113Approximate Number of 
Study CentersApproximately 150 centers; multi -natio nal. 
Dosage and 
AdministrationPatients will be randomized to receive once -daily  oral administration of 1 of 3 
starting doses of ponatinib: 45 mg (Cohort A), 30 mg (Cohort B), or 15 mg (Cohort 
C).  Patients starting at [ADDRESS_477794] their daily dose reduced to 15 mg 
upon achievement of ≤1% BCR -ABL1IS(as defined within the protocol). 
Mandatory dose reduction on response details are described in Section 14.1.3 . 
Dose interruptions or reductions should be implemented for patients who experience 
treatment -related AEs (TRAEs) upon clinical judgment of the investigator.  
Guidelines for management of TRAEs are described in Section 14.2.2 . 
Concomitant Treatment Medical or surgical treatment necessary for the patient’s well -being is perm itted.  
Where appropriate, patients may be treated with hematopoietic growth factors for 
limited times.
Antidiabetic Treatment
Patients with diabetes are at increased risk of experiencing arterial occlusive events 
while being treated with ponatinib. Theref ore, as a part of the assessment and 
management of the patient’s cardiovascular risk factors, initiation of or 
modifications to diabetic care should be considered in patients being treated with 
ponatinib who have elevated glucose levels.   The American Diab etes Association 
guidelines should be followed, and antidiabetic treatment and lifestyle intervention 
(including but not limited to weight loss, decreased fat intake, calorie restriction, 
increased physical activity, and smoking cessation) should be starte d in any patient 
with fasting glucose > 130 mg/dL (7.2 mmol/L) and/or HbA1c ≥7% ( Diabetes 
Preventio n Program Research Group, 2002 ; American Diabetes Association, 
Position Statement 2003 ).
Hypertension Treatment
Hypertension (HTN) may contribute to risk of arterial occlusive events.  Patients 
who have HTN should be managed appropriately before initiating treatment.  During 
ponatinib treatment, blood pressure elevations should be monitored and managed.  
Hypertensio n should be treated to achieve a goal of < 150/90 mmHg.  Initial 
antihy pertensive treatment should generally include a thiazide -type diuretic, calcium 
channel blocker, angiotensin -converting enzyme inhibitor, or angiotensin receptor 
blocker ( James et al, 2014 ).  Ponatinib treatment should be temporarily interrupted if 
HTN is not medically controlled.  Patients may require urgent clinical intervention

05 October 2020 Page 15 of 113should be avoided, but are not prohibited (see Section 14.6) .
Medications that prolong the QT interval (QT), but are without a known risk of 
Torsades de Pointes, should be avoided but are not prohibited.  If such medications are necessary and are used while a patient is on study, additional ECG monitoring should be performed as clinically indicated.
Efficacy Evaluation Hematologic response rate, cytogenetic response rate, molecular response rate, and 
disease progression will be assessed according to standard criteria, as follows:
! Bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_381379]
! BCR-ABL1ISassessment to determine molecular response
! Complete blood count (CBC) for assessment of hematologic response
! Survival follow-up
Patients will be followed for response, progression, and survival, for [ADDRESS_477795] 1 dose of ponatinib will be considered evaluable for 
safety.  The AE, AOE and VTE incidence rates, as well as the frequency of occurrence of overall toxicity—categorized by [CONTACT_333101] (severity)—will be described for each cohort.  Listings of laboratory test results will also be generated, and descriptive statistics summarizing the changes in laboratory tests over time will 
be presented. 
Pharmacokinetic 
EvaluationBlood samples will be collected at specified time points to characterize the 
pharmacokinetics of ponatinib. Upon implementation of Amendment 6, no further PK sample collection will be performed as all ongoing patients have completed at least 12 cycles of treatment.
Plasma ponatinib concentration-time data will be obtained to contribute to 
population PK and exposure-response analyse s of safety and efficacy. The analysis 
plan for the population PK and exposure-response analyses will be defined separately and the results of these analyses will be reported separately.

05October 2020 Page 16of 113stratified by [CONTACT_23276] ( ≥60 vs. < 60 years) and history of hypertension, 
diabetes, and/ or hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035] (yes/no). 
Cohorts A, B, and C will consist of CP -CML patients (resistant to previous TKI 
therapy  or who have T315I mutation) being administered a daily starting dose of [ADDRESS_477797] their daily dose reduced to 15 mg upon achievement of ≤1% BCR -ABL1IS
(as defined below and in the protocol).  Each cohort of patients will be analyzed 
separately for efficacy and safety.
The primary endpoint for this trial will be ≤1% BCR -ABL1ISrate at [ADDRESS_477798] 12 months of follow -up; 
however, preliminary analyses may be performed at earlier time points.
Statistical inference will be made for each of the 3 cohor ts separately, with the 
primary  endpoint of ≤1% BCR -ABL1IStested at 2 -sided 0.05/3=0.0167 significant 
level using the Bonferroni method for multiplicity adjustment.  The primary analysis 
of the primary endpoint of ≤1% BCR -ABL1ISwill be performed using a 2-sided 
exact 98.3% confidence interval (CI) for ≤1% BCR -ABL1ISrate based on the 
intention -to-treat (ITT) population.  Any other comparisons will be descriptive.
Sample Size Determination: 
The primary endpoint for this trial will be the ≤1% BCR -ABL1ISrate at 12 mo nths.  
Consistent with the phase 2 PACE trial, the null or uninteresting ≤1% BCR -ABL1IS
rate is set at 20%.  The alternative ≤1% BCR -ABL1ISrate is set at 35%.  Using the 
Bonferro ni method, t he overall 2 -sided significant level for statisti cal testing in each 
cohort will be set at 0.0167.  The primary analysis of the primary endpoint of ≤1% 
BCR -ABL1ISwill be performed using a [ADDRESS_477799] 98.3% CI for ≤1% BCR -
ABL1ISrate based on the ITT population.
A total sample size of 276 patients or 92 patients in each cohort (1:1:1) will 
distinguish a favorable ≤1% BCR -ABL1ISrate of 35% from a null or an 
uninteresting ≤1% BCR -ABL1ISrate of 20%, with a nominal 80% power and a 1 -
sided ty pe I error rate of 0.0083 (equivalent to a 2 -sided 0.0167) us ing an exact 
binomial test. Using the 20% boundary for ≤1% BCR -ABL1IS, 29 or mo re ≤1% 
BCR -ABL1ISresponders will be needed for a lower limit of the [ADDRESS_477800] 98.3% 
CI for the ≤1% BCR -ABL1ISrate to exceed 20%. 
Rationale for Number of 
PatientsThe total number of patients planned to be enrolled in this study is based on the sum 
of the individual cohorts described in the statistical considerations (276 patients).

This protocol describes a phase 2 open -label study  of 3 different starting dosages of ponat inib for 
treatm ent of patients with refractory  chronic myelo id leukemia (CML) in chronic phase (CP).  
Ponatinib was designed to inhibit the BCR -ABL1 protein, the pathogenetic driver of CML, with

preclinical experiments, to inhibit or prevent t he emergence of all single mutations that arise in 
the course of therapy  with imatinib, dasat inib, nilotinib, and bosut inib, and which have been 
observed to engender resistance of CML to treatment with these current ly available t yrosine 
kinase inhibitors ( TKIs).  Data from the phase [ADDRESS_477811] 
supported the preclinical findings and demo nstrated that ponatinib has substant ial activity in 
CML that has beco me resistant to prior therapy.
Ponatinib ( Iclusig®, ARIAD Pharmaceut icals, Inc. ) is approved in the [LOCATION_002] (US) for the 
treatm ent of adult patients with chronic phase, accelerated phase, or blast phase chronic myelo id 
leukemia (CML) or Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymph oblastic l eukemia (Ph+ ALL) 
for who m no other TKI therapy  is indicated and for treatment of adult patients with T315I-
positive CML (chronic phase, accelerated phase, or blast phase) or T315I -posit ive Ph+ ALL .In 
the European Unio n (EU), ponatinib is approv ed for the treatm ent of adult patients with CML 
(chronic phase, accelerated phase, or blast phase ) and Ph+ ALL who are resistant to dasatinib (or 
nilotinib for CML) and into lerant to dasatinib (or nilot inib for CML) and for who m subsequent 
treatm ent wi th imatinib is not clinically appropriate, or who have the T315I mutation.
The phase 2 clinical trial of ponat inibin pat ients wit h CML or Ph+ ALL who have had prior TKI 
therapy  (AP24534-10- 201, PACE), which supported the drug’s approvals, tested a starting do se 
of 45mg daily. The [ADDRESS_477812] recent dasatinib or nilotinib therapy

demonstrated a hi gher cum ulative incidence of arterial occlusive events (including 
cardi ovascular, cerebrovascular, and peripheral vascular events) observed wit h a longer follow -
up, than reported at the time of the init ial approval.  Arterial and venous thrombosis and 
occlusions—including fatal my ocardial  infarction (MI), stroke, severe peripheral vascular 
disease, and the need for urgent revascularizat ion procedures —have been reported in ponatinib -
treated pati ents.
Current data suggest that a dose -effect relat ionship exists with efficacy and with the occurren ce 
of arteri al occl usive events (AOEs), and that a lower daily dose may  reduce the incidence of 
AOEs.  This clinical study  will assess the relat ionships of exposure with efficacy and safet y: 
patients will  receive a range of init ial doses, and at defined t ime points, patients in response will 
undergo a dose reduction.  The goal of the study  will thus be to understand induct ion of 
responses, maintenance of responses, safet y, and exposure -response as consequences of these 
dosing strategies.

(N=31/43) was 72% (CCy R rate of 65. 1%) and 83.3% in patients with T315I; the MMR rate for 
these patients was 55.8%; and the MR4.5 ( ≤0.0032% BCR -ABL1IS) rate was 32.6%.  Duration 
of MCyR ranged from 8 to 345 weeks (median not yet reached), and the Kaplan -Meier method 
estimated that 72% of r esponders will remain in MCyR at 4y ears.  At the time of analysis, of the

In a popul ation with refractory  disease and few viable treatment options, achieving an init ial 
response is among the most important goals of TKI treatment.  The starting dose of 45 mg once 
daily  used in the phase 2 tri al of ponatinib has been shown to yiel d responses in a high 
proporti on of  patients.  The exposure -response analyses to date also support the conclusio ns from  
univariate and mult ivariate analyses: that patients who receive a higher starting dose (and 
therefore, a higher exposure, on average) ac hieve a response more quickly.  However, response 
rates are sufficient ly high to reasonably attempt ident ificat ion—both prospectively and with 
greater resol ution—of the effect of lower starting doses.  Thus, this clinical study  will test

8.3.2 Dose Intensity and Safety 
Multivariate analyses on data from the phase 2 PACE trial were also performed to elucidate the 
relationship between dose intensit y (as m easured by  [CONTACT_381429]) and safet y.  In general, 
increasing dose intensit y correlated with an increased probabilit y of experiencing AEs.  The
factors associated with a lower probabilit y of AEs were y ounger age, less t ime since diagnosis, 
and fewer prior TKIs.  Patients with a T315I mutatio n (who were generally y ounger, wi th a 
shorter time since diagnosis and fewer prior TKI therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) did, in f act, experi ence less 
thrombocy topenia and neutropeni a. 
With longer fo llow-up and the accumulat ion of AOEs and VTEs, the relat ionship between dose 
intensity and the events was examined, using mult ivariate analysis wit h an expanded set of 
covari ates wi th a minimum o f 24 m onths of fo llow-up.  All modeling showed that dose intensit y 
(up to the time of the events) was statist ically -significant ly associated with an increase in event 
rate in univariate models, and became more significant when adjust ing for covari ates in 
multivariate models.  
The specific relat ionships among dose, AOEs and VTEs, and clinical covariates were also 
examined.  Data are shown below in Table 4.  The analysis demo nstrates that the strongest 
associ ations wi th the occurrence of vascular events were observed with age (odds ratio 1.82; 
p
<0.0001), a medical history  of di abetes (odds ratio 3.69; p=0.0003), dose intensit y (oddsratio 
1.99/15 -mg dose; p=0.0009), a medical history of ischemia (odds ratio 2.46; p=0.0087), and time 
since diagnosis (odds ratio 2.03; p=0.0228).  Other contribut ing factors were baseline neutrophil 
(p=0.0276) and platelet counts (p=0.0466), the numbe r of pri or regimens (p=0.0755), and the 
presence of the T315I mutation (p=0.1328).

the risk of vascular events.  
Data demonstrate that despi[INVESTIGATOR_381380] y (as a resul t of AEs), pati ents are able 
to maintain responses.  Data from the patients in the phase 2 PACE trial who underwent dose

These findings illustrate that patients who achieved response, either at 45 mg or 30 mg, 
maintained responses after dose reduction (because of AEs) to [ADDRESS_477831] achieved 
response in this study . 
Taken together, these data support the use of a 45 -mg dose or a 30- mg dose to achieve a 
response in pat ients with no effecti ve treatm ent optio ns, and to then reduce the dose to maintain 
response while lowering the risk of long -term AEs.
8.5 Rationale behind Measures to Reduce Risk
Therapy  with ponatinib should be init iated by  a physician experienced in the diagnosis and 
treatm ent o f patients with leukemia.  As discussed and as demo nstrated in the mult ivariate 
analyses, several aspects of patient history  contribute to the risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_381381]; while pat ients both with and wit hout ri sk factors experienc e such 
complicat ions, the presence of certain risks is strongly  associated wi th AEs. Table 6
demonstrates the univariate relat ionship between a variet y of histori cal risk factors and the 
occurrence of vascular complicat ions in the phase 2 PACE trial.

It is clear that certain risks, such as prior MI or coronary  disease, can be discretely  identified in 
patient medical history  and are associ ated wi th increased risk.  Thus, based on these 
observat ions, pati ents wi th MI, unstable angina, or CHF within [ADDRESS_477832] dose of 
ponatinib are excluded fro m the study .  Similarly , pati ents wi th a history  of clinically  significant 
atrial arrhy thmia or any  ventricular arrhy thmia are also excluded.  
Other ident ified baseline risk factors for serious AOEs and VTEs include diabetes mellitus, 
hypertensio n, and hypercho lesterolemia.  These condit ions can be managed in the course of 
therapy; consequent ly, their appropriate medical treatment and control are mandatory  in this 
clinical trial.
8.6 Rationale for the Ponatinib Phase 2 Dose- Ranging Clinical Trial
Ponatinib is approved for the treatment of CP -CML pati ents, based on response rate observations 
in refractory  patients in a phase 2 clinical trial (AP24534-10- 201, PACE).  Responses were 
achieved in heavily  pretreated patients and in patients who had resistance mutations, but also in 
patients who di d not.  Responses were durable, with 39.6% of CP -CML pat ients continuing to 
receive clinical benefit and remaining on ponatinib for > 4 years.  Continuing analyses of t he

ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (a wholly -owned 
subsidiary of [COMPANY_005] Pharmaceutical Ltd. Co.)AP24534 -14-[ADDRESS_477833] demo nstrated a higher cumulat ive incidence of arterial occlusive events 
(including cardio vascular, cerebrovascular, and peripheral vascular events) observed wit h a 
longer fo llow-up, than reported at the time of the init ial approvals i n the US and EU.  Thus, there 
exists a need to examine strategies to lessen vascular complications of long -term therapy  in these 
patients who have a substant ial, unmet therapeuti c need and stand to benefit from ponat inib 
therapy .
Analyses fro m the phase [ADDRESS_477834] relat ionship exists with 
the occurrence of responses.  The conclusio ns of the m ultivariate analyses support the 
proposi tion that hi gher dose intensit ies in refractory  patients yield higher response rates across
the dose ranges tested.  This provides the basis for retaining a starting dose of 45 mg daily, which 
will maximize the possibilit y of each patient achieving a rapid response and maintaining it —both 
key requi rements of successful therapy in pat ients with this unmet medical need.  Based on the 
preclinical findings and addit ional clinical observati ons, supporting evidence points to lower 
dose intensit ies having the capabilit y to induce and maintain cy togeneti c responses in pat ients 
with CP-CML.  Steady -state peak plasma concentrations o f ponatinib at dose levels o f 45 m g, 
30mg, and 15 mg exceeded the concentration (40 nM) required to suppress the emergence of 
any resistant BCR -ABL1 mutations.  Efficacy was demonstrated at each of these dose levels, and

In summary, this rando mized phase 2 clinical trial will examine a range of ponatinib doses—
both init ially and as part of a dose reduction strategy —in CP-CML pat ients, and will generate 
data on efficacy and safet y in relation to dose, supported by [CONTACT_381432].  The goal o f 
this study is to test the hypothesis that each of the 3 starting doses will demo nstrate the continued 
efficacy  of ponat inib, and that the dose reduction strategy will lessen vascular occlusive 
complicat ions in the resistant CP -CML patient populat ion—includin g pati ents wi th or wi thout 
the T315I mutation who have no alternative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_55328].
9 STUDY OBJECTIVES
9.1 Primary Objective
 To characterize the efficacy o f ponatinib administered in 3 starting doses (45 mg, 30 mg, 
and 15 m g daily ) in pat ients with CP-CML who are resistant to prior TKI therapy  or have 
T315I m utation, as measured by  ≤1% BCR -ABL1ISat 12 months.
9.2 Secondary Objectives
 To characterize the rate of major mo lecular response (MMR) at 12 and 24 months and rate 
of major cy togenetic response (MCyR) by 12 m onths
 To evaluate duration of MMR

defined in Section 11.  The trial will also assess the short- and long-term safety of the 3 starting 
doses investigated.
Patients will be randomized to receive once-daily oral administration of 1 of 3 starting doses of 
ponatinib: 45 mg (Cohort A), 30 mg (Cohort B), or 15 mg (Cohort C).  Patients starting at [ADDRESS_477838] their daily dose reduced to 15 mg upon achievement of ≤1% BCR-ABL1IS, 
as described in Section 14.1.3.   In the event of loss of ≤1% BCR-ABL1ISafter dose reduction 
for response, and in the absence of AEs necessitating continued dose reduction, escalation back 
to the starting dose will be allowed, upon review  and agreement with the medical monitor. 
All randomized patients will enter the Main Treatment Period.  Patients will remain on treatment 
in the Main Treatment Period for 24 months.  Following completion of or withdrawal from the 
Main Treatment Period (as described in Section 12.4.1 ), patients who are both tolerating 
treatment and receiving clinical benefit from tr eatment may enter into the optional Treatment 
Continuation Period upon discussion and agre ement between the investigator and medical 
monitor.  Examples of clinical benefit that could allow a patient to enter the Treatment 
Continuation Period include (but are not limited to) a reduction from baseline in BCR-ABLIS
levels (but without meeting the protocol-defined response criterion of ≤1% BCR-ABL1ISat

10.2 Description of Treatment
Patients will be randomized to receive once-daily oral administration of 1 of 3 starting doses of 
ponatinib: 45 mg (Cohort A), 30 mg (Cohort B), or 15 mg (Cohort C). 
Mandatory dose reduction: Patients will undergo assessments for achievement of ≤1% 
BCR-ABL1ISand for consideration of mandatory dose reduction at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months (or if 
an unscheduled response assessment is performed).  The schedule for dose reduction is described 
in Section 14.1.3.  
Escalation for loss of response following dose reduction: Patients who undergo dose reduction 
upon achievement of ≤1% BCR-ABL1ISand who, with continued monitoring, lose the ≤1% 
BCR-ABL1ISmay undergo dose escalation back to the starting dose at the discretion of the 
physician and upon review with the medical moni tor.  The dose re-escalation schema is 
described in Section 14.1.4.
Dosing during the Treatment Continuation Period: Patients in the Treatment Continuation 
Period will be treated with study drug in accordance with Section 14.1.5.  
10.3 Randomization
Patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive ponatinib in one of three different starting 
dose cohorts:
! Cohort A: 45 mg QD with reduction to 15 mg at 3, 6, 9, or 12 months upon achievement of 
≤1% BCR-ABL1IS 
! Cohort B: 30 mg QD with reduction to 15 mg at 3, 6, 9, or 12 months upon achievement of 
≤1% BCR-ABL1IS

23 Treatment Continuation Procedures
Continuation patients (including both those who enter the Treatment Continuation Period 
before completing all 24 cycles of the Main Treatment Period and those who enter the 
Treatment Continuation Period after comp leting all 24 cycles of the Main Treatment 
Period) will generally be evaluated every [ADDRESS_477868] completed ≥[ADDRESS_477869] and patient 
visits (for visits that would otherwise occur at the end of odd- and even-numbered cycles, 
respectively, as shown in  Table 8) .  In all cases, the schedule will be arranged so that

24 End-of-Treatment or Early Termination Procedures
The End-of-Treatment (or early termination) visit should be performed within 2 weeks 
(14 days) of the patient’s last dose of study drug or the patient/investigator decision to 
discontinue treatment—whichever occurs later. A follow-up visit should be conducted 
approximately 30 days (±7 days) after the last dose of study treatment. For both visits, the 
information may be collected from tests that we re performed for the study or as part of the 
patient’s routine medical care. Patients that do not return to the clinic and attempts to 
contact [CONTACT_381443]-up. At 
least three attempts must be made to contact [CONTACT_102], and must be documented. See 
Section 12.2.2 for further details on discontinuation of patients from study drug. For 
patients continuing on to the optional Treatment Continuation Period, the End-of-
Treatment and subsequent follow-up visits should be performed only after the patient 
discontinues from the optional Treatment Continuation Period. Property of [COMPANY_005]: For Non-Commercial Use Only and Subject to the Applicable Terms of Usetinuatinuat ioi

14.1 Study Treatment
Patients will be randomized to receive ponatinib at 1 of 3 starting doses (45 mg, 30 mg, or 
15 mg) QD.  Ponatinib will be self-administered by  [CONTACT_128762] a daily schedule.  Each 28-day 
dosing period is referred to as 1 cycle.
Study treatment will be administered only to  eligible randomized patients at qualified centers 
(e.g., listed on the FDA Form 1572).
14.1.1 Starting Do se Assignment 
The starting dose of ponatinib will be 45 mg (Cohort A), 30 mg (Cohort B), or 15 mg (Cohort 
C), taken orally once daily.  Patients starting at [ADDRESS_477884] their daily dose 
reduced to 15 mg if ≤ 1% BCR-ABL1IShas been achieved, as described in Section 14.1.3.

dosing during the Treatment Continuation Period). Dose reduction based upon response can also 
be implemented when an unscheduled response assessment is performed. Dose reduction should 
be implemented as soon as feasible (preferably in [ADDRESS_477888] been co mmunicated to the sites). An unscheduled visit may be required to implement this 
change. No dose reduction for response will be implemented for patients in the 15 mg QD 
cohort.
The primary  endpoint of this study  will be achievement of ≤1% BCR -ABL1IS at [ADDRESS_477889] 
establis hed by  [CONTACT_381449] (IS) ( Marin, 2014 ; NCCN, 2014; Baccarani  et al , 2013 ; 
Marin et al, 2012 ; Lauseker et al , 2012; Saglio et al, 2012 ) .  
Patients will  undergo a baseline BM aspi[INVESTIGATOR_381391] c assessment to establish their 
diagnosis and eligibilit y.  They  will then undergo mo lecular monitoring at 3 -month intervals for 
the assessme nt of response and to inform the decisio n regarding dose reduction.  Patients will 
undergo a BM aspi[INVESTIGATOR_381392] c assessment after 12 cy cles, and at addit ional time po ints 
as specified in the Schedule of Events ( Table 8).  Details o f BM acquisit ion are also listed in 
Secti on12.1,
 Item 16.
Note: Patients who begin therapy  at 45 m g or 30 mg may  undergo dose reduction for adverse 
events (see Section 14.2.2 )
 prior to the achievement of ≤ 1% BCR -ABL1IS.  Thi s shoul d not 
affect the assessment of response ( ≤ 1% BCR -ABL1IS) nor the m andated reducti on to 15 m g QD 
upon its attainment. 
The schedule of patient assessment for mandat ory response- related dose reduction is as 
follows :
Patients in the [ADDRESS_477890] achieved ≤1% BCR -ABL1IS.  If not, they  will cont inue at their current dose until the 
6-month assessme nt. 
At [ADDRESS_477891] achieved ≤1% 
BCR- ABL1IS.  If not, they  will cont inue at their current dose until the [ADDRESS_477892] achieve d 
≤1% 
BCR- ABL1IS.  If not, they  will cont inue at their current dose until the [ADDRESS_477893] achieved ≤1% 
BCR -ABL1IS. 
Patients will discontinue therapy  in the Main Treatment Period if they  are not in ≤1% 
BCR- ABL1ISat the time of mo lecular assessment at 12 months.  
14.1.4 Loss of Response after Dose Reduction for ≤1% BCR -ABL1IS

medical mo nitor.
As described in Section 14.1.3 , pati ents in the cohorts starting at 45 mg (Cohort A) and 30 m g 
(Cohort B) will undergo dose reduction to 15 mg upon achievement of ≤1% BCR -ABL1IS
during the Main Treatment Period.  With continued monitoring at the reduced dose, should 
patients f rom Cohort A or Cohort B demonstrate loss of ≤1% BCR -ABL1IS as determined by  
[CONTACT_292358], they  may be candidates for dose escalat ion.  Dose escalat ion can be 
implemented at the discret ion of the physician and upon review wit h the m edical m onitor. 
Patients will  be monitored wi th molecular response assessmen ts according to the Schedule of 
Events ( Table 7and Table 8).  If the assessment does not demonstrate loss of ≤1% 
BCR- ABL1IS, asdefined in Section [IP_ADDRESS] ,continued mo nitoring is indicated.  If the 
assessment indicates loss of ≤1% BCR -ABL1IS, dose escal ation may be considered.
Patients may be dose re -escalated as follows:
Patients m ay only un dergo dose re -escalat ion if they are in Cohort A or Cohort B and do not 
have ongo ing AEs necessitat ing treatment at 10 mg or 15 mg as per Section 14.2.2 (Dose 
Modificat ions for Adverse Drug React ions). 
For pati ents in Cohort A, escalate to the starting dose of [ADDRESS_477894] not y et resumed dosing at 45 mg, escalate to 30 mg.  
For patients in Cohort B, escalate to the starting dose of 30 mg.
For pati ents in Cohort C, loss of ≤1% BCR -ABL1ISmandates their discont inuat ion from the 
Main Treatment Period.
If pat ients regain ≤1% BCR -ABL1ISafter dose escal ation, continue their therapy  at the escalated 
dose and m onitor according to the Schedule of Events ( Table 7and Table 8).

cerebrovascular disease, 3.78 for diabetes mellitus, 2.49 for hy pertensi on, and 2.07 for 
hypercho lesterol emia.  Based on thi s analysis, the fo llowing supportive care recomm endat ions 
are provided to decrease the risk of AOEs and VTEs for patients taking ponat inib.
Antidiabetic Treatment
Patients wi th diabetes are at i ncreased risk of experiencing arterial occlusive events while being 
treated with ponat inib.  Therefore, as a p art of the assessment and management of the patient’s 
cardi ovascular risk factors, init iation of or m odificati ons to di abetic care shoul d be considered in 
patients being treated with ponatinib who have elevated glucose levels.  The American Diabetes 
Associ ation gui delines shoul d be f ollowed, and antidiabet ic treatment and lifest yle intervent ion 
(including but not limited to weight loss, decreased fat intake, calorie restrict ion, increased 
physical act ivity, and smoking cessat ion) should be started in any pa tient wi th fasting glucose 
>130 m g/dL (7.2 mm ol/L) and/or HbA1c ≥7% ( Diabetes Prevent ion Program  Research Group, 
2002; American Diabetes Association, Position Statement 2003 ) .
Hypertension Treatment
Hypertensio n (HTN) m ay contribute to ri sk of  arteri al occl usive events.  Patients who have HTN 
shoul d be managed appropri ately  before ini tiating treatm ent.  During ponatinib treatment, blood 
pressure elevations should be mo nitored and managed.  Hy pertensio n shoul d be treated to 
achieve a goal of < 150/90 mmHg.  Init ial antihypertensive treatment should generally include a 
thiazide -type di uretic, calcium channel blocker (CCB), angiotensin -converting enzyme inhibitor 
(ACEI), or angiotensin receptor blocker (A RB) ( James et al , 2014 ).  Ponatinib treatment should 
be tem porarily  interrupted if HTN is not medically controlled (refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS] below for 
additional management recommendat ions).  Pati ents m ay require urgent clinical intervent ion for 
HTN associated with confusio n, headache, chest pain, or shortness of breath.

occurred in ponat inib-treated pati ents.  Pati ents wi th and wi thout cardi ovascular ri sk factors, 
including patients age 50 y ears or y ounger, experienced these events.  Vascular occlusive 
adverse events were more frequent with increasing age and in patients with prior history of 
ischemia, hypertensio n, diabetes, or hy perlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035].
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Arterial Occlusion and Thrombosis 
Serious arteri al occl usive AEs occurred in ponatinib -treated pati ents; some pati ents experi enced 
events of more than 1 ty pe.  Seri ous cardi ovascular occl usive AEs included MI and coronary  
artery  disease.  Som e pati ents devel oped CHF concurrent or subsequent to the my ocardial  
ischemic event.
Serious cerebrovascular AEs were also reported in ponat inib-treated pati ents.  Som e pati ents 
developed stenosis of large arterial vessels of the brain (e.g., carotid, vertebral, or middle 
cerebral artery ).  
Serious peri pheral arteri al AEs were reported in ponat inib-treated pati ents; so me developed 
digital or distal  extremit y necrosi s with com plicat ions of diabetes mellitus and peripheral arterial 
disease that required amputations.
Moni tor and aggressively  treat f actors that increase cardiovascular risks, such as hypertensio n, 
smoking, hyperchol esterolemia, and hyperglycemia.  Interrupt and consider discont inuat ion of 
study  drug in patients who develop arterial occlusive AEs.  Any pat ient who experiences a 
serious AE of MI, stroke, or urgent revascularization while on trial must be discont inued fro m 
the trial un less the invest igator believes the potential benefit s of ponatinib treatment are likely to 
exceed the risks of cont inued treatment for that individual patient and the patient has no other 
treatm ent opti ons.
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Venous Thromboembolism
Serious venous thromboembo lic AEs occurred in ponatinib -treated pati ents, incl uding deep 
venous thrombosis, pulmo nary embolism, superficial  thrombophlebi tis, and retinal vein 
thrombosis.  Consider dose modification or discontinuat ion of ponatinib in pat ients who develop 
serious ven ous thromboembolic AEs.  Ponatinib should not be restarted in patients with serious 
venous occlusive AEs unless the investigator believes the potential benefit outweighs the risk of 
recurrent venous occlusio ns and the patient has no other treatment options .
[IP_ADDRESS] Neuropathy
Serious peri pheral and cranial neuropathic AEs have occurred in ponatinib -treated patients.  In 
clinical trials, serious peripheral neuropathic AEs reported included peripheral neuropathy , 
paresthesia, hypoesthesia, and hyperesthesia.  Of the patients who developed neuropathy , many 
did so during the first month of treatment.  Monitor patients for symptoms of neuropathy , such as 
hypoesthesia, hyperesthesia, paresthesia, disco mfort, a burning sensation, neuropathic pain, or 
weakness.  Consider in terrupting ponat inib and evaluate if neuropathy is suspected.

[IP_ADDRESS] CHF and Left Ventricular Dysfunction
Severe CHF and left ventricular (LV) dysfunct ion have been reported in patients taking 
ponatinib.  Patients with cardiac disease or risk factors for cardiac disease should be monitored 
carefully , and any patient with signs or symptom s consistent with cardiac failure should be 
evaluated and treated.  Consider discontinuation o f ponatinib in pat ients who develop serious 
CHF.
[IP_ADDRESS] Hypertension
Blood pressure shoul d be m onitored at each visit.  HTN detected by  [CONTACT_2669] 2 bl ood pressure 
measurements should be graded according to NCI CTCAE, v4.0, which defines HTN as a 
disorder characterized by a pathological increase in blood pressure: a repeated elevat ion in the 
blood pressure exceeding [ADDRESS_477899] comm only observed as renal artery stenosis.  Renal artery  stenosis has been 
observed in patients taking ponat inib; monitoring for significant or unexplained hypertensio n 
shoul d therefore include an assessment for renal vascular disease.  If hypertensio n is persistent 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_381393] (i.e., 3 or more medications), or if grade 3 or 4 HTN 
develops, dose interruption and reduction is recommended accordin g to Dose Modificat ion 
Guidelines for general nonhematologic AEs in Table 9.
[IP_ADDRESS] Ocular Toxicity
Serious ocul ar AE toxi cities leading to bl indness or blurred visio n have occurred in ponatinib -
treated pati ents.  Retinal toxicit ies, including macular edema, retinal vein occlusio n, and retinal 
hemorrhage, have also occurred in ponatinib -treated pati ents.  Other ocular toxicit ies include 
cataract s, glauco ma, ir

closely  with serial  enzyme level determinations.  See Table 9for details.
[IP_ADDRESS] Hemorrhage
Hem orrhagic events have occurred in patients receiving ponatinib.  Most of these events 
occurred in pat ients with grade 4 thrombocy topenia.  Interrupt administration in the case of 
serious or severe hemorrhage.
[IP_ADDRESS] Fluid Retention and Edema
Ponatinib is associated with edema and occasio nally  serious fluid retenti on.  Pati ents sho uld be 
weighed and m onitored regul arly for signs and symptom s of fluid retention.  An unexpected and 
rapid wei ght gain shoul d be carefully investigated and appropriate treatment provided.  Interrupt, 
reduce the dose of, or discontinue ponatinib as outlined in Table 9.
[IP_ADDRESS] Cardiac Arrhythmias
Supraventricular tachyarrhyt hmias were reported in patients treated with ponatinib.  Advise 
patients t o report si gns and symptoms of rapid heart rate (such as palpi[INVESTIGATOR_381394]).  
Symptom atic bradyarrhyt hmias have also been reported.  Advise patients to report signs and 
symptoms suggest ive of slow heart rate (including faint ing, dizziness, or chest pain; see Table 9).
[IP_ADDRESS] Myelosuppression
Neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocy topeni a have been observed in clinical studies of ponatinib 
in patients with CML.  While myelo suppressio n can occur at any  time during treatment, its onset 
in CML pati ents m ost comm only occurs wi thin the first m onth of treatm ent.  My elosuppressi on 
can partially be attributed to the CML itself; however, treatment with p onatinib coul d also 
contribute.  These events can ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_175640] m anaged wi th supportive care and, if believed by [CONTACT_381451] -related, ei ther a reductio n or i nterrupti on of  treatm ent wi th ponat inib 
shoul d occur (see Table 9).  Rarely, one or more cy topenias can lead to perm anent 
discontinuat ion of treatm ent.  The use of hematopoiet ic growth factors, such as granulocyte 
colony-stimulat ing factor and granulocyte -macrophage co lony-stimulat ing factor, is permitted on 
study; these agents may be used to support blood counts as clinically indicated to minimize 
treatm ent interruptions or repeated dose reductions.
The important c linical AE of febrile neutropenia falls under the broad category of 
myelosuppressio n.  If a patient’s individual risk factors present a high risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_381395] a, primary  prophylactic use of colony -stimulat ing growth factors for the preve ntion or

to the start of therapy  for those deem ed at ri sk.  Rasburicase and other appropriate treatments for 
hyperuricemia or TLS are permitted.
[IP_ADDRESS] Rash and/or Pruritus
Skin rashes have been commo nly reported to be associated with ponat inib.  The vast majorit y of 
these skin events are nonserious —either self -limit ing or m anageable wit h ant ihistamines or 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_20306]—and do not resul t in discont inuat ion.  In more severe cases, a short course of 
oral corti costeroi ds m ay be used unt il the rash has improved or resolved. 
In pati ents treated wi th ponatinib, the most commo n skin manifestations are a diffuse 
maculo -papular rash that is nonprurit ic and an acneiform dermatit is.  Occasionally, p atients 
treated with ponat inib have been reported to have a dry , flaky, or exfoliat ive type of rash or a 
psori asiform  dermat itis.  Rarely, an erythema mult iform e type of rash has been associated with 
ponatinib.
Most patients can be maintained on their curr ent dose of ponatinib, uninterrupted; if necessary, 
their symptoms can be managed wit h ant ihistamines, emo llients, or topi[INVESTIGATOR_8826].  If dose 
interrupti on is indicated, pati ents can resume the same dose of ponatinib —typi[INVESTIGATOR_381396]

[IP_ADDRESS] Diarrhea, Nausea, and Vomiting 
Diarrhea is a commo n side effect of ponatinib, and the use of antidiarrheal medicat ions is 
permitted.  Patients who experience ≥grade [ADDRESS_477901] 
treatm ent schedule (4 m g orally  
×1, then 2 m g orally  after each l oose stool , up to a m aximum  of 
16 m g/day).
Nausea and vo miting are also reported as side effects of ponatinib.  The use of an ant iemetic 
prophylact ically is not recommended.  However, if a patient is symptomat ic, appropriate 
antiemetic medicat ions may be used as clinically indicated.
[IP_ADDRESS] Constitutional Symptoms/Joint Pain
Certain const itutional symptom s—such as myalgia, arthralgia, headache, weakness, fa tigue, 
asthenia, and low -grade fever —have been very  comm only reported wi th ponat inib.  These 
symptoms have been reported mainly  at the ini tiation of treatment, are ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_381398]-lived 
(<2weeks), and are seldo m, if ever, reported bey ond the fi rst m onth of treatm ent.  These AEs 
are m ost comm only l ow-grade (grade 1 and 2) and are self -resolving, without the need for dose 
interrupti on or dose reducti on, when they  do occur.  Most patients can be maintained on their 
current dose of ponatinib, uninterrupted, a nd their symptoms can be managed with a short course 
of oral analgesics, corti costeroi ds, and/or antipyretics as clinically indicated.  If dose interruption 
is indicated, patients can resume the same dose of ponatinib —typi[INVESTIGATOR_381399]—once the ori ginal  epi[INVESTIGATOR_381400].

PRES, al so known as reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndro me, is a neurological 
disorder that can pr esent with signs and symptoms such as seizure, headache, decreased 
alertness, al tered m ental  functioning, visio n loss, and other visual and neuro logical disturbances.  
No cases of PRES have been reported in clinical trials conducted by [CONTACT_381452], but two 
postm arket ing cases related to PRES have been reported in ponat inib-treated pati ents.  If PRES 
is diagnosed, interrupt ponatinib treatment and resume treatment only  once the event is resolved, 
and if the benefit of cont inued treatment outweighs the risk of PRES.
14.2.2 Dose Modifications for Adverse Drug Reactions
[IP_ADDRESS] Dose Reduction Guidelines 
Dose reduction guidelines for ponatinib are summarized in Table 9, and AEs should be graded 
according to NCI CTCAE, v4.0. These guidelines should be fo llowed by  [CONTACT_381453]; 
however, for an individual pat ient, dose interruptions, reductions, and treatm ent di scont inuat ion 
shoul d also be based on the clinical circumstance. Variat ion from these guidelines must be 
communicated with the sponsor or sponsor designee, ideally prior to implementation, but no later 
than [ADDRESS_477903] be documented. Whe n the observed toxicit y has reso lved to ≤grade [ADDRESS_477904] igator may resume dosing if clinically indicated. Guidance for 
re-escalation after resolut ion of adverse drug reactions is provided in Section [IP_ADDRESS] .
Dose reduction below 10 mg once -daily is not permitted in the Main Treat ment Period (see 
Table 9; a reduced dosing frequency  may be permitted in the Treatment Continuation Period in 
accordance with Sect ion14.1.5 )
.  Doses may be interrupted for study drug -related toxi cities for 
up to 28 day s.  If a nonhematologic, study  drug -related toxi city does not resolve to ≤ grade [ADDRESS_477905] be 
discontinued fro m study  treatm ent.  If a hematologic study  drug -related toxicit y does not resolve 
to ≤ grade 1 or has not returned to baseline after dose interruption for more than 28 day s, the 
sponsor’s medical mo nitor must be conta cted.  Addit ionally , the sponsor’s m edical  monitor m ust

In vitro studies demonstrate that human CYP3A4 is invo lved in the metabolism o f ponatinib.  In 
light of this, a drug -drug interaction study  was perform ed wi th a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor in 
healt hy subjects, and ketoconazole co -administration was found to increase ponatinib C maxand 
AUC by 47% and 78%, respectively.  Another drug- drug interaction study  was perform ed wi th a
strong CYP3A4 inducer in healt hy subjects, and co -administration o f ponatinib fo llowing 
multiple doses of rifampin was found to decrease ponatinib C maxand AUC by 42% and 62%, 
respectively .  Since CYP3A4 contributes to the metabolism of ponat inib, strong inducers or 
inhibitors of CYP3A4 should be used wit h caution or avoided altogether.  If co -administration 
with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 is unavo idable, consider reduction of the ponatinib dose 1 
level fro m the current dose (that is, 30 mg for a patient receiving 45 mg; 15 mg for a patient 
receiving 30 mg).  Consider an alternative to the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor or, if that is not 
possible, consult the sponsor.  Co- administration of strong CYP3A inducers with ponat inib 
shoul d be avoi ded unless the benefit outwei ghs the ri sk of  decreased ponat inib exposure.  
Patients shoul d be m onitored f or reduced efficacy  if co-administration with strong CYP3A 
inducers cannot be avoided.  Select ion of conco mitant medicat ion with no or minimal CYP3A 
induct ion potential is recommended.
Medicat ions that are associated with the prolongat ion of the QT interval may interact with

designated representative.
15.1.4 Reporting Period
All AEs (serious, non -serious, and adverse events of special interest [AESIs]) should be recorded

concl uding [ADDRESS_477928] dose of the assigned study  treatm ent in the study  or the 
investigator/patient decisio n to di scont inue treatment, whichever occurs later. 
Once a pat ient is deemed a screen failure, AE collection is no longer required (see Section 12.2.1
Screen Failures). Any SAEs ongoing at the end of the reporting period should be fo llowed unt il 
they resolve to baseline, stabilize, or are considered to be chronic/irreversible. 
There i s no requi rement to m onitor subj ects f or SAEs after end of study . Invest igators in the 
European Economic Area (EEA) are obligated to report SAEs that they  become aware of, to the

reporting period. 
15.1.5 AE Severity
The severit y of AEs will be assessed according to the NCI CTCAE, v4.0 (see
 Appendix C and 
the Study  Reference Manual).  If the AE is not defined in the CTCAE, the investigator will 
determine its severit y based on the fo llowing definit ions:
 Mild (grade 1): The AE is noticeable to the patient but does not interfere with routine 
activit y.  
 Moderate (grade 2): The AE interferes with routine activit y but responds to symptomat ic 
therapy  or rest.  
 Severe (grade 3): The AE significant ly limits the patient’s abilit y to perform routine 
activit ies despi[INVESTIGATOR_43538].  
 Life-Threatening (grade 4): The patient is at immediate risk of death.
 Death (grade 5): The patient dies as a direct result of the complicat ion or condit ion induced 
by [CONTACT_84204].

15.1.7 Expectedness
The expectedness of an SAE is assessed by [CONTACT_381462] y.  The current Clinical Investigator’s Brochure will be used as the 
reference for determinat ion of expectedness and risk assessment for ponatinib.
15.2 Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and Adverse Events of Special Interests (AESIs)
The definit ions and reporting requirements of ICH Gui delines for Clini cal Safet y Data 
Management, Definit ions and Standards for Expedited Reporting, Topic E2A , will  be adhered to 
in this study .
15.2.[ADDRESS_477930] one of these condit ions applies:
Death: An AE that results in death is any  patient death wi thin [ADDRESS_477931] dose 
of study  drug administrati on.  The cause of death or AE that resulted in a fatal outcome 
is the SAE.
Life-threatening: An AE that places the patient, in the view of the invest igator or the 
sponsor, at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred (i.e., this does not 
include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused dea th)

Important medical event: Medical and scient ific judgment shoul d be exercised in 
determining whether an event is an important medical event.  An important medical 
event m ay not resul t in death, be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3094].  However, 
if it is determined that the event may jeopardize th e pati ent and/or may  requi re 
intervent ion to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definit ion above, that 
important medical event should be reported as serious.  Examples of such events are 
intensive treatment in an Em ergency  Room  or at hom e for allergic bronchospasm, 
blood dyscrasias, or convulsio ns that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3094], or the 
development of drug dependency  or drug abuse.

16 PLANNED STATISTICAL METHODS
16.1 General Considerations
For the purposes of this protocol and all analyses, unless otherwise specified, a month is defined 
as 28 days, the same l ength as a cycle of treatment for ponatinib. 
Eligible CP -CML patients wil l be rando mized to 3 dose cohorts (45 mg, 30 mg, and 15 mg).  
Patients starting at [ADDRESS_477938] their daily  dose reduced to 15 m g upon 
achievement of ≤1% BCR -ABL1IS.  Each cohort of patients will be analyzed separately  for 
efficacy  and safety .
Categorical data will be summarized by [CONTACT_16785] .  
Continuous variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_327793], including mean, standard 
deviat ion, median, and range.
Statistical inference will be made fo r each of the 3 cohorts separately —each wi th the primary  
endpo int of ≤1% BCR -ABL1IStested at 2 -sided 0.05/3=0.0167 significance level, using the

subsidiary of [COMPANY_005] Pharmaceutical Ltd. Co.)AP24534 -14-[ADDRESS_477939] ment. The primary  analysis o f the primary  endpoint of 
≤1% BCR -ABL1ISwill be perform ed using a [ADDRESS_477940] 98.3% CI for ≤1% BCR -ABL1IS
rate based on the ITT populat ion followed through the Main Treatment Period. Any  other 
comparisons will be descriptive. An interim analysis (IA) is planned for this study  after all 
patients have been enrolled in the study . The IA data summary  will be descri ptive in nature. The 
primary  analysis is planned to be performed when all patients have at least 12 months of  
treatm ent. Addi tional analyses may be performed at later time points to d evelop addit ional CSRs 
as per sponsor's discretion. In addit ion, the data will be summarized and reported at least 
annually.
16.2 Analysis Populations
ITT Population: The ITT population will include all rando mized pat ients, regardless of whether 
they take the a ssigned study  drug.  The primary  analyses of efficacy  will be based on thi s 
popul ation.  Rando mized patients without response assessments will be considered as non -
responders in the primary  efficacy  analysis (see Secti on16.5.2.1 ).
Treated Population: The treated populat ion for each cohort includes all pat ients who have 
received at least one dose of study  drug.  The primary  analyses of safet y will be based on this 
popul ation.
Per-protocol Population: The per -protocol population includes all pat ients who are 
rando mized, receive at least [ADDRESS_477941] response d ata (such as failure to satisfy [ADDRESS_477942] dose [e.g., dose that was not the one to which the patient was rando mized]).  Major 
protoc ol violations will be finalized and documented prior to database lock.

Exploratory Endpoints
16.4 Determination of Sample Size
The primary endpoint for this trial is ≤1% BCR-ABL1ISat 12 months.   Consistent with the 
phase 2 PACE trial, the null or uninteresting ≤1% BCR-ABL1ISrate is set at 20%.  The 
alternative ≤1% BCR-ABL1ISrate is set at 35%.  Using the Bonferroni method, the over all 
2-sided significance level for statis tical testing in each cohort w ill be set at 0.0167.  The primary 
analysis of the primary endpoint of ≤1% BCR-ABL1ISwill be performed using a 2-sided exact 
98.3% CI for ≤1% BCR-ABL1ISrate based on the ITT population.
A total sample size of 276 patients or 92 patients in each cohort (1:1:1) will distinguish a 
favorable ≤1% BCR-ABL1ISrate of 35% from a null or an uninteresting ≤1% BCR-ABL1ISrate 
of 20% with a nominal 80% power and a 1-sided type I error rate of 0.0083 (equivalent to a 
2-sided 0.0167) using an exact binomial test.  Using the 20% boundary for ≤1% BCR-ABL1IS, 
29 or more ≤1% BCR-ABL1ISresponders will be needed for a lower limit of the 2-sided exact 
98.3% CI for the ≤1% BCR-ABL1ISrate to exceed 20%.

[IP_ADDRESS] Secondary Efficacy Endpoints
Analyse s of secondary  response endpoints, such as MCyR, CCyR, MMR, and CHR, will be 
perform ed in the same way as the primary  endpoint.  For the secondary  endpoints of time to 
≤1% BCR -ABL1ISand time to MMR, descript ive statist ics will be provided for patients wh o 
meet the criteria for response.  For the secondary  endpoints of durati on of  ≤1% BCR -ABL1IS, 
and MMR, the Kaplan -Meier m ethod will  be used to estimate duration of response among 
patients m eeting the criteria for response.  Rates of patients remaining in MCyR, ≤1% BCR -
ABL1ISand MMR at 12, 18, and 24 months, respectively, as well as the proportion of patients 
meet ing MCyR by 12 months and CCyR at 12 months by [CONTACT_381473], will be presented.  
The rate of progression to AP or BP will be summarized.  PFS and OS will also be estimated, 
using the Kaplan -Meier m ethod.  Medi an time to event and its 2 -sided 95% CI will be provided.  
The analyses of time to event and duration of response will be conducted for each dose cohort, 
and for descript ive purposes only.
The analyses of secondary efficacy endpo ints will be performed on the ITT populat ion.  The 
analyses o f secondary  endpoints m ay also be perform ed on the per -protocol populat ion.
[IP_ADDRESS] Data Handling Rules for Secondary Efficacy Endpoint Analyses
The fo llowing rul es will  be implemented for the primary  analysis of the secondary endpoints of 
MCyR and CCyR in CP -CML pat ients:
 Patients will  be excluded from  the analysis if they  meet any  of the f ollowing criteria:
● Have fewer than 20 metaphases examined at baseline 
● Are in CCyR at baseline 
● Undergo no baseline cy togenetic assessment
● Have a variant translocat ion that i s not assessable for cy togenetic response
 Patients will  be considered as non -responders if they  meet any  of the fo llowing 
criteria:
oAre rando mized but untreated
oDo not respond by  12 m onths after the init iation of study  treatm ent
 At any given cy togeneti c assessment after baseline, if fewer than 20 metaphases are 
examined, the following rule will apply to the determination o f MCyR:

For this reason, we evaluated patient reported  xerostomia in a n 
ongoing prospective observational trial  (LCCC 1540: Prospective Evaluation of Patient Reported 
Xerostomia After Whole Brain Radiation).  At an interim analysis of LCCC 1540 with accrual at 
90% of the goal, we found a clinically -meaningful rate of xerostomia following routine W BRT . 
Furthermore, the incidence/severity appeared  to be related to parotid dose. The goal of this 
follow -up study is to investigate whether parotid sparing WBRT can reduce or prevent patient 
reported xerostomia. The study design will principally be a prospective randomized trial where patients are randomized to receive parotid sparing WBRT vs. standard WBRT where the parotids 
are not avoided. We will evaluate the xerostomia scores (using  the University of Michigan 
Xerostomia Questionnaire [2]) of patients treated in each arm. Patients who refuse randomization 
will be offered enrollment in an observational arm to follow their symptoms of xerostomia for secondary  analysis. This will be a multi -site study, with patients also enrolling  at High Point 
Regional Health, High Point, North Carolina, as well as possibly other sites and institutions . We 
anticipate a total accrual of approximately 90 patients ( 45 in each interventional arm)  with a goal 
of [ADDRESS_887124] demonstrated that the degree of parotid gland exposure is related to the severity of xerostomia  [2-5]. These studies have led to a national 
consensus guideline regarding minimization of parotid doses (e.g., mean bilateral parotid dose should be ≤ 25 Gy)  [6]. Due to these guidelines, it is now standard to delineate the parotid glands 
and to use conformal treatment techniques such as intensity-modulated radiation therapy to minimize incidental irradiation to these organs in patients being treated for head and neck cancer.  1.2.2 Whole Brain Radiation – Background and Quality of Life  
 Whole brain radiation is commonly used for patients with multiple brain metastases. The prognosis of most patients who require whole brain radiation is poor, with ma ny not living 
beyond six months  [7]. Quality of life is thus of paramount importance in this population. 
Numerous prospective studies have reported on the well- known side effects of fatigue, alopecia, 
and neurocognitive decline following WBRT . This is balanced with the potential improvement in 
quality of life due to control of CNS disease [8-10]. While patients do occasionally complain of 
dry mouth following whole brain radiation, no prior studies have systematically assessed the frequency or severity of dry mouth in these patients, though one older case series did report several cases of paroti tis following WBRT [11].  We believe that these symptoms are related to 
2 
 incidental irradiation of the parotids, and that simple adjustments to the traditional RT fields can 
mitigate this toxicity.   
 1.2.3 Whole Brain Radiation – Standard Approach, Organs at Risk, and Parotid Dose  
 Due to the poor prognosis for most patients receiving whole brain radiation, and because typi[INVESTIGATOR_657915] 20- 35 Gy (vs. 60- 70 Gy for patients 
with head and neck cancer), the parotids have not traditionally been considered an organ at risk in patients receiving whole brain radiation. Historically, whole brain radiation fields were designed based on the anatomy as seen on planning skull radiographs, and this ‘standard approach’ has not changed in several decades. While sophisticated computer -based tec hniques 
readily enable the consideration of 3D anatomy (e.g. from CT and/or MRI) in the treatment planning process, these newer approaches have not been applied in patients receiving whole brain radiation. The accepted standard WBRT field includes roughly 5- 10mm of margin 
inferiorly around the cribiform plate and i nferior skull, as well as coverage of the entire C1  and 
sometimes C2  vertebral bodies. For the purposes of WBRT, no standard normal tissues are 
delineated for avoidance, though the lenses are often delineated at the discretion of the treating 
physician.  As such, the location of the parotid glands is  not considered during planning for whole brain 
radiation, and there are presently no dose/volume limits for the parotids. For example, in patients receiving whole brain radiation on the nationwide RTOG 0933 tri al using hippocampal sparing 
intensity -modulated radiation, only the hippocampus, eyes, and lenses were required to be 
delineated with set dose limits. [12] In patients receiving whole brain radiation on oth er 
protocols, such as N107C, [13] no organs at risk are required to be delineated. Thus, the risk of 
radiation -associated parotid injury is not appreciated.   
 
Nonetheless, the parotids do, in fact, receive substantial radiation dose during whole brain radiation For instance, several dosimetric studies r eport mean parotid doses of 10 to 20 Gy. [ 1, 
14, 15] However, prior to LCCC [ADDRESS_887125] that incidental parotid irradiation may cause meaningful toxicity in patients receiving whole brain radiation: 
 
1. Gradual dose response: Though the recommended parotid “dose limit” for patients with head and neck cancer is  20- 25 Gy, there is a gradual dose response, and it is 
recommended that par otid dose is kept as low as possible (e.g. << 20 Gy) to minimize 
xerostomia. Thus, mean parotid doses in the 10- 20 Gy range (as is reported with whole 
brain radiation) may cause toxicity. 
2. Acute vs. late toxicity: Parotid dose guidelines in patients with head and neck cancer are 
based on late (e.g. ≥[ADDRESS_887126] -RT) toxicity. Patients generally suffer greater acute  
toxicities during RT, [16] or at shorter time intervals (e .g., 1-6 months) post- RT, with 
some recovery of salivary function at later time p oints. These acute toxicities are what 
matter most to patients receiving whole brain radiation; given their poor prognoses, few will survive long enough for later (e .g. ≥[ADDRESS_887127] -radiation) salivary recovery.  
3 
 3. Higher doses per fraction and shorter overall radiation treatment times: Though parotid 
doses during whole brain radiation are lower than for head and neck cancer, whole brain 
radiation is delivered in larger doses per fraction (2.5 -3.0 Gy per fraction as opposed to 
1.8-2.0 Gy per fraction for head and neck cancer) and in a shorter treatment time (e.g. 2-3 
weeks as opposed to 7 weeks for head and neck cancer). Higher doses per fraction and 
shorter treatment intervals are both associated with increased risks of toxicity.  
1.2.5 Preliminary Results of L CCC 1540: Prospective Evaluation of Patient Reported 
Xerostomia After Whole Brain Radiation  
 
These hypotheses culminated in the design of LCCC 1540. We used the validated University of Mich igan Xerostomia Questionnaire [2] and a “bother score” questionnaire to assess patient -
reported xerostomia after standard whole brain radiation, in which the parotid glands were not prospectively delineated. The parotids were, however, retrospectively delineated to assess impact of parotid dose on xerostomia. Like other reports, the parotid glands received mean doses of roughly [ADDRESS_887128] data on the actual clinical significance of this incidental exposure. In an interim analysis with accrual at 90% of the goal, xerostomia was common, sometimes severe, and often persisted to the last post -RT assessment. Further, 
parotid doses were strongly correlated with xerostomia, consistent with our original hypothesis. These novel data have important implications for quality of life and perhaps even nutritional status in this vulnerable patient population, and were accepted for oral presentation this year at two national conferences (ACRO 2017 and ASTRO 2017).

 Figure 1. LCCC 1540:  Change in xerostomia score (y -axis) p lotted against parotid dose (x- axis) 
for all [ADDRESS_887129]-RT primary endpoint. Parotid doses were 
significantly correlated with xerostomia (p=0.005). (Parotid V20Gy: % of the bilateral parotid glands receiving at least 20 Gy) . 
 
 
 Figure 2. LCCC 1540:  Mean xerostomia score change (A) and bother (B) were significantly 
worse in patients with higher parotid dose at most time points. (Parotid V20: % of the bilateral parotid glands receiving at least 20 Gy).  These are the first data demonstrating that dry m outh is a toxicity of WBRT and have 
implications on field design during treatment planning.  1.3 Purpose and Rationale  Given  that the results of LCCC 1540 show a relationship between parotid dose and toxicity, it is 
our new hypothesis that prospective delineation of the parotids and minimization of dose to the parotids can provide clinically meaningful reductions in xerostomia while still adequately treating the brain. This is supported by a secondary analysis of LCCC 1540, where we assessed 
whether new radiation plans designed retrospectively to avoid the parotids could meaningfully reduce dose to the parotids while simultaneously maintaining adequate coverage of the brain. For the original (and delivered plans), the  median parotid mean dose was 17 Gy and median parotid 
V20Gy was 48%. With systematic re -planning to reduce parotid exposure, the median parotid 
mean dose was reduced to 8 Gy and the median parotid V20Gy  was reduced to 14%. This 
reduction in parotid dose did not appear to come at significant expense to brain coverage: the volume of brain receiving 95% of the prescription dose was 99.86% for the parotid sparing 
plans, vs. 99.99% for the original plans (Example, Figure 3).

Figure 3. Panel A:  Radiation fields for a patient receiving whole brain RT on LCCC [ADDRESS_887130] -RT xerostomia. The parotids were not prospectively delineated and 
received a mean dose of 20 Gy. Panel B: Alternative plan with fields designed to reduce paro tid 
exposure resulting in a mean parotid dose of only 11 Gy. The volume of brain covered by 95% of prescription dose was 99.98% for the original, vs. 99.65% for the re-plan (thus parotid sparing does not significantly compromise target coverage).  
 The results of LCCC [ADDRESS_887131] of care in our department. Because coverage of the brain does not appear to be compromised with the use of parotid sparing (see Figure 3 , above ), several physicians who are familiar with data from LCCC [ADDRESS_887132] WBRT fields (where the parotids are not avoided) in randomized patients.  
 2.[ADDRESS_887133] exposed the parotids to a significant ( estimated >10 Gy 
mean parotid dose) level of radiation. Patients receiving prior stereotactic radiosurgery for brain 
metastasis are  eligi ble for inclusion in this trial as this form of radiation is highly conformal and 
exposes the p arotids to minimal (estimated < 1 Gy) radiation.

 4.0 STUDY PLAN 
 
4.1 Schema  
                                   Note:  Due to the expedited nature of many whole brain radiation treatment plans, we anticipate identifying many subjects after treatment has already begun. Because of this, we will offer these individuals enrollment on an observational arm of this study. Additionally, if participants do not wish to participate in the interventional arm of this study, they will be approached for the 
observational arm. See Section 4.3 for more details.

relapse.  
 4.3.1 Screening for Eligibility and Registration Details  
 Patients identified as qualifying for the trial will be divided into those who were identified prior 
to radiation start vs. those identifi ed after radiation start. Patients  interested in participating will 
complete a n anonymous screening  baseline xerostomia  questionnaire identical to the primary 
study assessment (see Section 4.3.9, below ). Patients scoring ≥ 40 pts on the screening 
xerostomia q uestionnaire are ineligible. Patients scoring < 40 / 80 will be eligible and offered 
enrollment on the study. Questionnaires completed by [CONTACT_657926]. Questionnaires completed by [CONTACT_657927]  (de-anonymized) and serve as their  
baseline quality of life data.  
 Patients identified prior to radiation start will be offered enrollment into the randomization arms (Consent form 1, arms A and B), with the observation arm ( Consent form 2, arm C) offered to 
those who refuse randomization. Patients identified after radiation has already  started , but within 
[ADDRESS_887138] day of radiation, will be offered enrollment into the observational arm (Consent form 2, arm C).  
 4.3.[ADDRESS_887139] of randomized assignments will be provided to each site prior to enrollment of participants to facilitate ease of trial administration. This is done because of the often urgent nature of whole 
10 
 brain cases and the necessity of clinicians knowing the randomized assignm ent before treatment 
planning.

 4.3.[ADDRESS_887140] mask form fitted on the patient’s face and locked on to the table. Prior to the CT scan, a “scout X -ray” is taken to ensure the  patient is in an 
acceptable position. A CT scan is then obtained through the treatment area, and including the entire neck. These images are used to create the radiation treatment plan.  The planning CT scan 
is then transferred the treatment planning software program.  3D conformal radiation plans will 
then be created for each patient.  
 4.3.5 Treatment Planning  and Delivery  – Arm A: Standard WBRT (Control Arm)  
 Patients randomized to the control arm will receive  standard WBRT without delineation or 
avoidance of the parotid glands, as per typi[INVESTIGATOR_333575] (s ee Figure 4, below). Patients must  be 
enrolled prior to treatment.  Laterally arranged beams will be designed based on digitally 
reconstructed skull radiographs . A 5 -10 mm margin is used around the cribiform plate and skull 
base, with inferior extension of the field to cover the entirety of the C1 and/or C2 vertebra, with at least a 2mm margin anterior to the vertebral bodies. The parotids will not  be delineated for 
avoidance, and delineation of other organs at risk or the brain is optional, consistent with most national studies utilizing WBRT (see section 1.2.3). All treatment plans are monitored for quality assurance at departmental meetings in which radiation fields  are presented for peer review. 
Weekly X- ray films are taken to verify the accuracy of patient set up on actual treatment days. 
The initial treatment will not proceed without physician verification of accurate patient set up.

standard WBRT used in the control arm, where  a small margin is provided around the inferior 
skull border. The C1 vertebra is covered with a small anterior margin . No organs at risk are 
standardly delineated, though providers may opt to delineate the lens and orbits for avoidance, or 
the brain to ensure coverage.  4.3.6 Treatment Planning and Delivery – Arm B : Parotid sparing  WBRT ( Intervention  
Arm)  
 Patients randomized to the  intervention arm  will receive  parotid sparing  WBRT  (see Figure 5, 
below). Patients must be enrolled prior to treatment.   
- The left parotid will be delineated and named Parotid_Lt  
- The right parotid will be delineated and named Parotid_Rt  
- The Parotid_Lt and Parotid_Rt  structures will be combined and named 
Parotids_Bilateral  for use in planning and dosimetric analysis. 
- The brain will be delineated  to the level of the foramen magnum , marked by [CONTACT_657928] (see Figure 6, below), to ensure adequate target coverage.  
- Laterally arranged beams will be designed based on both digitally reconstructed skull radiographs and CT anatomy. Radiation fields will be altered to minimize overlap w ith 
the Parotids_Bilateral  contour , while maintaining around  a 1cm margin around the brain 
contour. All treatment plans are monitored for quality assurance at departmental meetings in which radiation fields are presented for peer review. Weekly X- ray films  are taken to 
verify the accuracy of patient s et up on actual treatment days. 
 

12 
 Based on the results of the replanning analysis from LCCC 1540, 87% of patients were able to 
achieve a bilateral parotid V20Gy <25% while maintaining a 1cm margin around the brain, and the range of replanned bilateral parotid V20Gy was 1-35%. Thus, there w ill be a goal to limit 
the Parotids_Bilateral V20Gy to <25%, and lower if possible. The following table 
summarizes the dose constraints of the parotid -sparing arm : 
 
Parotid -sparing WBRT arm dose constraints ( for Parotids Bilateral )

C2 vertebra (dotted circle).  
 4.3.7 Treatment Planning and Delivery – Arm C: Observational arm (WBRT protocol not specified)  
 Patients who decline randomization but consent to the observational arm will receive WBRT  
without the use of the abov e treatment planning guidelines. WBRT will be delivered using 
standard or parotid sparing fields, per treating physician preference. Patients may also enroll on this arm after initiation of WBRT, as long as the baseline questionnaire is completed within 5 days of initiation of treatment. These patients will complete the protocol-specified study assessments at the same time points as randomized patients.  
 4.3.8 Treatment Planning and Delivery – Quality Assurance  Given that whole brain radiation is often delivered in situations of medical ur gency, there will be 
no require ment for the PI [INVESTIGATOR_657916]. 
However, to ensure delivery of radiation as intended, a digitally reconstructed radiograph containing the treatment field and any delineated organs at risk or targets will be sent to the study coordinator for the first four randomized patients at each non-primary site participating in the protocol.  If the treatment plans are not found to be adequate, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_657917] a meeting with the pertinent sites to discuss requested corrections for future patients . 
Patients who received the incorrect treatment (per randomization) will not be analyzed as part of the primary endpoint.  
 4.3.9 Main Study Assessment : Xerostomia Questionnaire 
 Patients in this study will be asked to complete the Xerostomia Questionnaire and two additional supplemental survey questions at baseline (prior to radiation in randomized patients and within 5 

14 
 days of rad iation initiation  in patients refusing randomization  but consenting for the observation 
arm), at the end of radiation (on or within 5 days after the final day of radiation), then at two 
weeks (+/ - 5 days) and one, three, and six months (+/ - 7 days)  after radiation completion, for a 
total of six  planned surveys. This survey may be administered by [CONTACT_31303] , vs. in 
person if the patient has an appointment at the appropriate time point necessary for clini cal 
follow -up. This survey also acts as the screening questionnaire completed by [CONTACT_657929], and counts as the baseline questionnaire for those consenting to enrollment. 
 The full survey (see appendix)  will consist of the validated University of Michigan Xerostomia 
Questionnaire (questions 1-8) and two additional questions related to dry mouth, (questions 9-
10). Questions 1 -8 will be answered  on a Likert scale ranging from 0 (least bothersome) to 10 
(most bothersome), summed, and linearly converted to a scale from 0 -100. Questions 9- 10 will 
be answered on a Likert scale with four responses: Not at all, a little, quite a bit, and very much. Questions 9-10 are designed to quantify the overall importance of dry mouth symptoms to each patient, and were adapted from the validated EORTC QLQ-H&N35 head and neck specific 
questionnaire [17].  
 4.3.10 Other Assessments  At the initial / baseline assessment, patients’ Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status will be rec orded. Relevant dem ographic and clinical data w ill be abstracted 
from the medical record  as part of this study. For patients randomized to standard WBRT, t he 
parotids will be delineated retrospectively for dosimetric analysis. For patients randomized to parotid sparing WBRT, the parotids are prospectively delineated and dosimetric data prospectively collected. 
 
For the purposes of assessing factors potential ly confounding the measurement of dry mouth, we 
will prospectively record at the baseline assessment whether patients are taking different classes of medications. At the end of RT time point. We will record whether the patients required steroids at any point during radiation. At the [ADDRESS_887141] whether the patient has received systemic therapy (including chemotherapy) after WBRT. The details of these assessments are found in section 5.1 ( Time and Events Table).  
 4.3.[ADDRESS_887142] of care follow -up of these patients. No additional visits or protocol- specified 
imaging will be required, as this would unnecessarily burden thes e palliatively treated patients, 
given the minimal expectation that a meaningful difference in tumor control exists (see section below on expected r isks).  
 4.[ADDRESS_887143] to any risks specific to participation in this trial; these patients receive standard treatment and simply complete the study assessment at post- treatment time points. Several theoretic risks warrant  mention for patients randomized to 
parotid sparing WBRT:  
 
1. By [CONTACT_657930], the target (brain ) could receive a 
lower dose, which could place the patient at higher risk of inferior brain relapse.  
2. By [CONTACT_657931] C1/C2, patients may develop bony metastases in this location which may be more difficult to treat with radiation in the future, given the abutment of the prior parotid sparing field.  
 For the following reasons, these risks are minimal : 
 1. The standard field arrangements of WBRT covering  the upper cervical vertebrae have become 
standard practice with the advent of CT -based planning. Prior to CT -based planning, WBRT was 
delivered with an angled rectangular field splitting the cervical vertebrae . With the use of CT-
based planning, WBRT fields became horizontal, and coverage of the cervical vertebrae was added to provide an additional margin around the foramen magnum. However, our preliminary analysis of LCCC 1540 and other studies [15, 18 ] show that coverage of brain is minimally 
affected with alterations to the field to max imize sparing of the parotids. Some of these studies 
have done this by [CONTACT_657932][INVESTIGATOR_657918]. Therefore, target coverage is not expected to be compromised.  
 
2. Regardless of any  reductions in field size and the negligible impact on dose to the brain 
described above, whole brain radiation is ess entially treatment of mostly subclinical disease  in 
addition to areas of actual  brain metastases . However, the field of radiation oncology as a whole 
has generally accepted that treatment of subclinical disease in the brain is not strictly necessary. 
This is demonstrated by [CONTACT_657933]; it is generally accepted that if these patients develop 
new brain metastases they can be salvaged with additional stereot actic radiosurgery.  Therefore, a 
small margin reduction with the goal of improving patient quality of life in a population with limited life expectancy should be ac ceptable and entail minimal excess risk.  
 3. For the same reason as above, omission of the C1/C2 vertebrae should also be of minimal significance.  Given the overall poor prognosis of patients receiving WBRT, the rate of 
significant marginal bony relapses adjacent to the inferior WBRT field is expected to be extremely low. Furthermore, with the advent of stereotactic radiosurgery, any such relapses would still be safely treatable with definitive or palliative intent.  
 4. Finally, the willingness of many physicians and several institutions [1, 18- 20] to adopt parotid 
sparing WBRT  as their current standard is a testament to the generally low risk involved.  
 4.[ADDRESS_887144] to withdraw from participation in this study at any 
time. If a patient withdraws from the study, they will no longer be contact[CONTACT_657934].

6.0 UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS  
 
6.1. Definition  
 
As defined by [CONTACT_11604]’s IRB, unanticipated problems involving risks to study subjects or others (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_9961]) refers to any incident, experience, or outcome that:  
• Is unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given (a) the research 
procedures that are described in the protocol-related docum ents, such as the IRB -
approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the 
characteristics of the subject population being studied;  
• Is related or possibly related to a subject’s participation in the research; and  
• Suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm 
(including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) related to the research than was previously known or recognized. 
6.2. Reporting  
 Any UPI[INVESTIGATOR_657919] 6.[ADDRESS_887147] be reported to the UNC IRB using the IRB’s web-based reporting system.    6.3 Monit
oring and Oversight 
 The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_657920]  (DSMC)  as required. This will 
include UNC and affiliate  sites.   
 
Meetings/teleconferences will be held  at a frequency dependent upon study  accrual  and in 
consultation w ith the study  Biostatistician.  At these  meetings,  the research  team  will discuss all  
18 
 issues relevant  to study  progress,  including enrollment,  safety,  regulatory, data collection,  etc. 
and the team  will produce summaries  or minutes  of these meetings.   
 
 
7.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIO NS 
 
 7.1 Study Design / Study Endpoints  
 This is a prospective two arm randomized trial in which patients will complete the xerostomia 
questionnaire at six  time points, including baseline and five  post -radiation time points. The 
primary  study  endpoint is the change in composite xerostomia score (on a scale of 0 -100, 
converted fro m the xerostomia questionnaire that is on a scale from 0 -80; this conversion is 
made by [CONTACT_657924] 1-8 and dividing by 0.8, thus converting an 80 point scale into a 100 point scale) between baseline and 1 month. The xerostomia score change will be assessed using two methods: 1. Proportion of patients with a minimally clinically important diffe rence and 2. Mean chang e. In LCCC 1540 (at n=41), the mean xerostomia score 
change from baseline to [ADDRESS_887148] deviation. For s ample 
size calculations, we will therefore define a ≥ 15 point xerostomia score increase as a minimally 
clinically important difference.  
 7.2 Sample Size and Accrual  
 In LCCC 1540 (at n=41), the proportion of patients experiencing a ≥ 15 poin t xerostomia score 
increase was 42% (95% CI 26 -57%). Setting the null hypothesis proportion of patients 
experiencing ≥ 15 point xerostomia score increase at 42% and an alternative proportion of 14%, 
31 patients  in each group are needed for 80% power to detect this difference using a two group 
chi-square test with a one-sided significance of 0.05. 
 In order to have [ADDRESS_887149]- treatment surveys, we will 
target our enrollment for this study at 90 patients , given the patterns of patient attrition observed 
in LCCC 1540  and early enrollment to this study (assuming 70% completion rate ). To obtain this 
target accrual, we anticipate an accrual period of roughly 3- 5 years. T his number is based on 
extrapolated  accrual rates from LCCC 1540, which accrued 100 patients over roughly 2 years 
and the anticipated expansion of this study to other academic centers.  
 7.3 Data Analysis Plans  The primary data analysis plan is to compare the proportion of patients in each randomization arm experiencing a ≥[ADDRESS_887150].  As sample size allows,  linear mixed effects models will be 
explored to evaluate changes over time including all repeated measurements. It is anticipated th at 
a significant number of enrolled patients will be unable to co mplete the 3 month (estimated 40% 
response rate) and 6 month (estimated 20% response rate) post -radiation questionnaires due to 
disease morbidity and mortality, so modeling may be limited to the earlier time points. In such a 
19 
 scenario with significant patient dropout, separate analyses will be performed for patients with 
vs. without long term follow up.  Descriptive statistics will be provided for all scores at all time -points and to summarize the 
patient population. Secondary data ana lyses will estimate the time to  marginal relapse (defined  as 
within  1 cm of the block edge overlying the blocked parotids) and the time to  upper cervical 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_657921] (defined as relapses in the C1 or C2 vertebrae) in each randomization arm using the Kaplan Meier method . A log rank test will be used to compare these time to event outcomes. 
Furthermore, the above ana lyses exploring xerostomia will also be conducted in all patients 
(including those who refused randomization but consented for the observational arm).  A linear regression model will be used to further explore the dosimetric relationship between parotid dose and xerostomia,  to supplement data from LCCC 1 540. 
 7.4 Data Management/Audit  The University of North Carolina will serve as the coordinating center for this trial. All data will be collected, entered, and maintained in a database on secure  servers at the University of North 
Carolina at Chapel Hill. Questionnaires will be collected via Qualtrics and each site will be 
responsible for ensuring all questionnaires are ent ered into Qualtrics. Outside sites,  including the 
University of Michigan  andWake Forest University (High Point Regional H ealth ), will  send any 
other data via secure email to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  All data will be 
pooled at UNC whe re personnel there will coordinate and manage data for quality control 
assurance and integrity. Data analysis will take place at UNC as well. Accrual data will be collected and entered into OnCore
®. As an investigator- initiated study, this trial will also be 
audited by [CONTACT_657935] .  
 
8.[ADDRESS_887151] (IRB) Approval and Consent  
 
It is expected that the IRB will have the proper representation and function in accordance with federally man dated regulations.  The IRB should approve the consent form and protocol. 
 
In obtaining and documenting informed consent, the investigator should comply with the applicable regulatory requirement(s), and should adhere to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and to ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.  
   Before recruitment and enrollment onto this study, the patient will be given a full explanation of the study and will be given the opportunity to review the consent form. Each consent form must include all the relevant elements currently required by [CONTACT_44316]. Once this essential information has been provided to the patient and the investigator is assured that the patient understands the im plications of participating in the study, the patient 
will be asked to give consent to participate in the study by [CONTACT_10001]- approved consent 
form.  
 
20 
 Prior to a patient’s participation in the trial, the written informed consent form should be signed 
and personally dated by [CONTACT_37781]. 
8.[ADDRESS_887152] be provided to the Clinical Protocol Office (CPO) at the University of North Carolina.  
• A copy of the official IRB approval letter for the protocol and informed consent 
• CVs and medical licensure for the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_65445] 
• A copy of the IRB -approved consent form  
8.[ADDRESS_887153], and baseline/screening questionnaire. Additional patient information may also be requested by [CONTACT_657936]. For the randomized group, eligibility c riteria must be 
confirmed with the UNC study coordinator before the start of treatment. For the observational group, eligibility must be confirmed with the UNC coordinator within [ADDRESS_887154](s) to trial subjects without prior UNC IRB approval.  
 For any such emergency modification implemented, a UNC IRB modification form must be completed by [CONTACT_87231] (5) busin ess days of making the change. 
Affiliate site for this study are relying on UNC’s IRB and should follow the same procedures for emergency modifications.  
8.4.2 Single Patient/Subject Exceptions  
 Any request to enroll a single subject who does not meet all the eligibility criteria of this study requires the approval of the UNC Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_65446].  
8.4.3 Other Protocol Deviations/Violations  
 
21 
 According to UNC’s IRB, a protocol deviation  is any unplanned variance from an IRB approved 
protocol that:  
• Is generally noted or recognized after it occurs 
• Has n
o substantive effect on the risks to research participants  
• Has no substantive effect on the scientific integrity of the research plan or the 
value of the data collected  
• Did not result from willful or knowing misconduct on the part of the investigator(s).  
 An unplanned protocol variance is considered a violation  if t
 he variance meets any of the 
following criteria:  
• Has harmed or increased the risk of harm to one or more research participants.  
• Ha
s damaged the scientific integrity of the data collected for the study.  
• Results from willful or knowing misconduct on the part of the investigator(s).  
• Demonstrates serious or continuing noncompliance with federal regulations, 
State laws, or University policies.  
 
If a deviation or violation occurs please follow the guidelines below: 
 Protocol Deviations: UNC personnel will re cord the deviation in OnCore
® (or other appropriate 
database set up for the study), and report to any sponsor or data and safety monitoring committee in accordance with their policies.  Deviations should be summarized and reported to the IRB at the time of continuing review.  Protocol Violations: Violations should be reported by [CONTACT_65478] (1) week of 
the investigator becoming aware of the event using the same IRB online mechanism used to report UPI[INVESTIGATOR_9961].   
 Unanticipated Problems  Involving Risks to Subjects or Others (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_9961] ): Any events that 
meet the criteria for “Unanticipated Problems” as defined by [CONTACT_11604]’s IRB (see section 0) must be reported by [CONTACT_65479]’s web-based reporting system.

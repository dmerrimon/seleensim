4. Objectives:  
• To determine the impact of pr eoperative adm inistration of tranexamic acid on blood 
loss and transfusion rates in major oncologic surgery.   
• To evaluate the cost -effectiveness of tranexamic acid in major oncologic surgery.  
 
5. Background:  
Tranexamic acid was first introduced in the 1960’s as a treatmen t for heavy menstrual 
bleeding.[ADDRESS_43079] two decades, it’s use has been incorporated into surgical practice for 
patients u ndergoing open -heart surgery,  liver transp lantation, and urologic surgery .2-[ADDRESS_43080] been published when used at high doses (100 mg/kg), 
standard dosing regimens  have proven to be safe and effective.8,[ADDRESS_43081] of 
reduction  in bleeding has been demonstrated without an  increase in thromboembolic  
events.6 We believe tranexamic acid has potential to reduce bleeding in major oncologic 
surgery resulting in reduced blood loss and lower transfusion rates. An improvement in the 
rate of surgical complications related to bleeding may also  result in decreased hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41202]. 
 
6. Setting of the Research:  
Spectrum Health Butterworth Campus.   Lemmen -Holton Cancer Pavilion.  
 
7. Resources Available to Conduct this Research:  
Approximately [ADDRESS_43082] . 
 
8. Study Design:  
a. Recruitment Methods  
Potential subjects will be recruited at their preoperative office visit with their surgeon  
or, if applicable, during their inpatient stay prior to surgery . Informed consent will be 
obtained by [CONTACT_41204].  The potential subjects 
include all patients scheduled to undergo major oncologic surgery that meet all of  the 
Version Date: 20-November -2015 Page 2 of 5 inclusion criteria , and none of the exclusion criteria . There will  be no payment to 
study subjects.  We plan to enroll a total of 200 subjects, unless planned interim 
analyses determine otherwise.  
 
b. Inclusion Criteria  
• Subjects  undergoing major oncologic surgery for standard of care purposes 
(to include , but not limited to : liver resections, radical cholecystectomy, 
pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple procedure ), esophagectomy, 
gastrectomy, colectomy, and debulking with hyperthermic intraperitoneal 
chemotherapy , prostatectomies, nephrectomies, and partial neprectomies ) 
• Male or female > 18 years of age  
• Subject  agrees to participate in this study and provides informed consent  
 
Exclusion Criteria  
• Subjects  with a history of hypercoagulopathy, deep vein thrombosis  or 
pulmonary embolism  
• Subjects that are on anticoagulation or antiplat elet medications at the time of 
surgery other than Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]  
• Subjects with a history of TIA or Stroke  
• Subjects with a history of atrial fibrillation  
• Subjects with a known thrombus  
• Baseline creat inine level greater than 2. 83 mg/dL  
• Subjects with known hyperse nsitivity to tranexamic acid  
• Adults unable to provide informed consent  
• Children  
• Pregnant women  
• Prisoners  
• Non-English speaking  subjects  
• Any other medical condition including mental illness or substance abuse 
deemed by [CONTACT_41205] a subject ’s ability to 
provide informed consent, cooperate and take part in this research study  
 
c. Study Endpoints  
The primary outcome measures will be operative blood loss  and transfusion rates in 
subjects undergoing the eligible procedures. Second ary outcome measures will 
include  cost of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], intensive care unit length of stay, and total hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7491].  
 
d. Procedures Involved in the Research  
The study design will be a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled trial. 
Following satisfaction of inclusion /exclusion criteria  and enrollment into the study , 
designated pharmacy staff will be notified of the patient’s enrollment  and scheduled 
timing of surgery.  Designated pharmacy staff will randomize the patient  and assign 
the patient a unique study number. The subject will be randomized based on a 
predetermined algorithm by [CONTACT_41206] p reoperative intravenous 
tranexamic acid or preoperative intravenous isotonic electrolyte solution as  placebo. 
The preparation will be  indistinguishable by [CONTACT_41207] , surgical , or anesthesia staff . 
The tranexamic acid group will receive a [ADDRESS_43083] daily 
Version Date: 20-November -[ADDRESS_43084] for hemoglobin levels < 7.0 g/dL or 
hemoglobin level < 10 g/dL with clinical sym ptoms indicating need for transfusion , 
per standard practice . Final decision on transfusion will be made according to  the 
staff surgical oncologist’s discretion.  
 
Data to be recorded from operative records will include operative  blood loss, 
operative time,  amount of fluid received, and  intraoperative transfusion requirements. 
Postopera tive data including hemoglobin levels , transfusion requirements, surgical 
complications, thromboembolic events, length of ICU stay, length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], 
and cost of inpati ent stay . Subjects will be followed for [ADDRESS_43085].  
 
 
Version Date: 20-November -2015 Page 4 of 5 9. Statistical Plan  
a. Sample Size Determination  
We anticipate a 15 -20% reduction in transfusion rates  in the tranexamic arm when 
compared with placebo treatment . A sample size of 200 total  subjects , 100 in each 
arm of the study,  will be required to obtain a statistically significant result with p 
<0.05. Randomization will ensure an equal number of respective surgeries between 
the treatment and placebo arms of the study.  All subject s who consent to the trial 
who meet the above inclusion criteria  and complete the proposed dosing regimen  will 
be included in the sample size.  
 
b. Statistical Methods  
Summary statistics will be calculated.  Quantitative data will be expressed as the 
mean +SEM a nd nominal data will be expressed as a percentage.  Comparisons 
between groups for quantitative variables will be performed using the t -test. Nominal 
variables will be evaluated using the c2 test. Significance will be assessed at p<0.05.   
 
10. Risks to Subjects  
Tranexamic acid is an FDA approved medication. The safety of tranexamic acid has 
been demonstrated in a meta -analysis of the off-label use of tranexamic acid in the 
perioperative period . A theoretical risk of throm boembolic events exists, though  no 
signif icant adverse outcomes have been reported with the proposed dosing 
schedule.  Refer to [COMPANY_007] Physician Prescribing Information document  for a listing of 
potential adverse effects.  
 
11. Potential Benefits to Subjects  
Potential benefits include decreased surgica l blood loss resulting in decreased 
transfusion requirements. Transfusion of packed red blood cells has been associated 
with numerous potential adverse events. In addition, decreased overall hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41203] d complication rates.  
 
12. Provisions to Protect the Privacy I nterests of Subjects  
The study, potential risks and benefits of treatment will be discussed extensively with 
each potential subject at their preoperative office visit  (or as an inpatient, if 
applica ble) in a private space . Any questions they have  will be answered 
accordingly. Reported data will not contain identifiable information.  
 
13. Provisions to Maintain the Confidentiality of D ata 
Identifiable study data will be kept in a secure password -protected file or locked 
cabinets by [CONTACT_3462]. Pharmacy staff will have record of the randomization of 
each individual subject stored in a controlled , secure  area.  
 
14. Medical Care and Compensation for I njury  
Any medical or surgical complications experienced rel ative to this research will be treated in 
accordance with current standards of care. No study funds have been set  aside to 
compensate subjects for injury.  
 
15. Cost to Subjects  
Study drug, placebo, and preparation/administration will be paid for by [CONTACT_41208], and not billed to the subjects. All other aspects of the subject’s 
care are considered standard of care, and will be billed to the patient and/or their 
insurance company.

consider the study , they may take a research consent home for review purposes, 
and they may choose to consent to involvement in the study at any time up to the 
date of their scheduled surgical procedure . 
 
17. Vulnerable P opulations  
There will be no involvement of vulnerable populations in this study.

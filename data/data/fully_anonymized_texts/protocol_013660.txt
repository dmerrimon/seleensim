Protocol Title: A Randomized, Open -Label, Single -Dose, Three -Way Crossover Evaluation of the Effect of Food 
on the Pharmacokinetics, Safety, and Tolerability of TAK -227 in Healthy Adult Participants
Study Design:
This is a single -center, open -label, single -dose, randomized, 3 -period, 6-sequence, crossover study in healthy adults.
Study schematic and dose regimens are shown in Table 2.aand  Table 2.b. The schedule of assessments is shown in 
Schedule of Study Procedures (Section 3.0).
On Day  1 of Treatment Period 1 participants will be randomly assigned to one of 6 possible treatment sequences 
(Table 8.a). On Day 1 of each treatment period, a single dose of TAK -227 will be administered orally under one of 
3different feeding conditions as per the randomization schedule:
Fasting (Treatment A),
Fed pre -dose, high -fat/high -calorie meal administered 30 minu tes prio r to dosing (Treatment B), and
Fed post -dose, high -fat/high -calorie meal administered ~30 minutes after dosing (Treatment C).
For details on food and water consumption in the different treatments refer to Section 7.4.1 and Section 9.2.6.
There will be a washout period of not less than 4 days between TAK -227 dosing in each period.
Pharmacokinetic (PK) sample collections will be conducted pre -dose and up to [ADDRESS_586637] -dose in each treatment 
period.
Safety and tolerability will be assessed throughout the study by [CONTACT_3148] -emergent advers e events (TEAEs), vital 
signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs), clinical laboratory evaluations, and physical examinations.
The clinical research unit (CRU) will contact [CONTACT_55473] (including participants who terminate the study early) 
7(± 3) days after t he last TAK -227 administration by [CONTACT_459365] (AE) has occurred or concomitant medications have been taken since the last study visit. If 
clinically significant findings are observed upon discharge, participants may return to the CRU for re -evaluation per 
Investigator’s discretion.
Study Primary Objective:
To assess the PK of a single oral dose of 50 mg TAK -227 administered 30 minutes following the start of a 
high-fat/high -calorie meal or ~30 minutes before the start of a high -fat/high -calorie meal in healthy adult 
participants relative to administration under fasting conditions in healthy adult participants.
Study Secondary Objectives:
To evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single or al dose of 50 mg TAK -227 w hen administered under fasting 
conditio ns, 30 minutes following the start of a high -fat/high -calorie meal, and ~30 minutes before the start of a 
high-fat/high -calorie meal in healthy adult participants.
Study Exploratory Objective :
To evaluate other TAK -227 PK parameters for a single oral dose of 50 mg TAK -227 when administered under 
fasting conditions, 30 minutes following the start of a high -fat/high -calo rie meal, and ~30 minutes before the 
start of a high -fat/high -calorie meal i n healthy adult participants.
To evaluate TAK -227 metabolites PK parameters for a single oral dose of 50 mg TAK -227 when administered 
under fasting conditions, 30 minutes following the start of a high -fat/high -calorie meal, and ~30 minutes before 
the start of a high -fat/high -calorie meal in healthy adult participants.

CONFIDENTIALMain Criteria for Evaluation and Analyses:
Primary  Endpoint :
The primary endpoints will be assessed through evaluation of the following PK parameters for TAK -227 in plasma:
Maximum observed concentration (C max)
Area under the concentration -time curve from time [ADDRESS_586644] quantifiable concentration (AUC last)
Area under the concentration -time curve (AUC) from time [ADDRESS_586645] quantifiable concentration (AUC ∞)
Secondary endpoints :
The secondary endpoints will be assessed through evaluation of the following safety parameters: 
Treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and their freq uency, severity, seriousness, and causality 
assessments 
Changes in vital signs, ECGs, and clinical laboratory results (hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis) from 
baseline to post -baseline time points, and findings from physical examinations.
Explo ratory  Endpoints:
The exploratory endpoint will be assessed through evaluation of the following PK parameters for TAK -227 and its 
metabolites in plasma (if applicable, but are not limited to): 
Time to first occurrence of C max (tmax)
Lag time to first quantifiabl e concentration in plasma (t lag)
Terminal disposition phase rate constant (λ z)
Terminal disposition phase half -life (t ½z)
Apparent volume of distribution during the terminal disposition phase after oral administration, calculated using 
the observed value o f the last quantifiable concentration (V z/F; parent only)
Apparent clearance after oral administration, calculated using the observed value of the last quantifiable 
concentration (CL/F; parent only)
Area under the concentration -time curve (AUC) from the la st quantifiable concentration to infinity, calculated 
using the observed value of the last quantifiable concentration, expressed as a percentage of AUC ∞ (AUC extrap% )
The following PK parameters will also be evaluated for TAK -227 metabolites:
Maximum observ ed concentration (C max)
Area under the concentration -time curve (AUC) from time [ADDRESS_586646] quantifiable concentration 
(AUC last)
Area under the concentration -time curve (AUC) from time [ADDRESS_586647] quantifiable concentration (AUC ∞)
Statistical Considerations:
Pharmacokinetic analysis:
Individual TAK -227 and its metabolites plasma concentrations and PK parameters will be listed by [CONTACT_459367], and summarized by [CONTACT_3148] (TAK -227 plasma concentrations and PK parameters) and nominal time 
(TAK -227 plasma concentrations).
PK parameters (C max, AUC last, AUC ∞, AUC extrap%, tmax, λz, t½z, CL/F, V z/F, and t lag) will be computed using standard 
non-compartmental analysis (NCA). Actual time of sampling will be used to calculate the PK parameters.
All individual concentration data and PK parameters will be listed with summary statistics such as geometric mean, 
median, arithmetic mean, standard deviation (SD), coefficient of variation (CV), minimum and maximum. 
Individual plasma concentration/time curves will be presented in linear/linear and log/linear scale. At least 3 PK 
time points within the terminal log -linear phase will be used to estimate the terminal rate constant for each 
participant in each treatment period. The appropriate PK analysis will be fully specified in the Clinical 
Pharmacology Analysis Plan (CPAP). 
TAK -[ADDRESS_586648], and AUC ∞for TAK -[ADDRESS_586649]. Point estimates 
and their associated 90% confidence intervals (CIs) will be constructed for the differences between Treatment B (fed 
pre-dose) versus Treatment A (fasting), and Treatment C (fed post -dose) versus Treatment A (fasting). The point 
estimates and their associated 90% CIs will be then back transformed to provide poi nt estimates and 90% CIs for the 
ratios of Treatment B (fed pre -dose) versus Treatment A (fasting) and Treatment C (fed post -dose) versus Treatment 
A (fasting). 
Analy sis of t maxand t lagwill be performed by [CONTACT_459368].
Safety analy sis:
The safety data will be summarized descriptively for TEAEs, and potentially clinically significant values for clinical 
laborato ry tests, vital signs, 12 -lead ECG, and use of concomitant medications by [CONTACT_3148].
Sample Size Justification: 
The study  is designed to have approximately [ADDRESS_586650] based on the following:
The intra -participant CV was assumed at ~0.4 for C maxand AUC, which were estimated based on data in 
Study CEC -2
Reference data set is C maxor AUC under fasting condition; test data set is C maxor AUC under fed 
conditio ns
If the observed geometric mean ratio (GMR) is at 0.90 or 1.10, the estimated 90% CI of the GMR, with N = 
18, is within (0.70, 1.43) for both C maxand AUC
Accounting for possible dropouts, a total of 24 participants may be enrolled.

CONFIDENTIAL4.0 INTRODUCTION
4.1 Background
Celiac disease (CeD) is a commo n intestinal inflammatory  disease characteri zed by  [CONTACT_459369] . CeD is 
triggered and maintained in genet ically predisposed patients carrying human lymphocyte ant igen 
(HLA) ty pe D Q2 or DQ8, and it is do minated by [CONTACT_459370] T cell mediated immune response 
to gluten. Current ly the only therapeut ic option is a strictly fo llowed gl uten-free diet (GFD), and 
many pat ients do not achieve symptomat ic and histologic remissio n with dietary modification 
alone. Thus, there i s a great unmet medical need for a pharmaco logical treatm ent of  CeD.
Extracellular transglutaminase 2 (TG2) in the small intest inal mucosa plays a key  role in the 
pathogenesis of CeD. TG2 can either cross -link or deamidate glutamine -residues in gliadin 
pepti des derived from  gluten. The deamidated or cross -linked pept ides bind strongly to the HLA 
types DQ2 or DQ8 whi ch resul ts in T helper [ADDRESS_586654] ivity of TG2 woul d prevent 
deamidat ion of gliadin and could therefore block an init ial and crucial step in CeD pathogenesis.
The c ompound TAK -227 (also known as ZED1227) is a newly developed peptido mimet ic 
showing an efficient and highly select ive inhibit ion of TG2. In preclinical and early clinical 
studi es, TAK -227 dem onstrated a favorable safet y profile, justifying its further clin ical 
development. 
Through to 8 -Sep- 2022, a total of 270 healt hy volunteers and participants with CeD were 
exposed to TAK -
227in 5 co mpleted clinical studies: Phase 1 single ascending dose study in 
healt hy participants (CEC -1), Phase 1 mult iple ascending dose study  in healt hy participants 
(CEC -2), Phase 2a efficacy and tolerabilit y, proof -of-concept, study  in participants wi th 
well-controlled CeD undergo ing gluten challenge (CEC -3), Phase 1 PK study  in healt hy 
participants (CEC -5), and Phase 1 mass balance study  in healt hy participants (CEC -6).A total 
of [ADDRESS_586655] received either TAK -227 or placebo in the double blinded 
ongoing Phase 2b dose -finding study  of efficacy and tolerabilit y in adults wit h CeD experiencing 
symptoms and wit h intestinal injury  despi [INVESTIGATOR_459358] -free diet (CEC -4).

dose.
Following single dose administration in rats and minipi[INVESTIGATOR_14107], TAK -227 di splayed low abso lute 
bioavailabilit y (1.5% to4% in rat and 3.2% to 6.0% in minipi[INVESTIGATOR_14107]). Due to the large differences in 
abundance of the biotransformat ion products detected in vivo to the in vitro profile of TAK -227 
in hepatocy tes, i t is current ly assumed that the biotransfo rmation of  TAK -227 occurs m ainly  
extra -hepat ically. The m etabo lism of TAK -227 in human liver microso mes was significant ly

In the course of the two Phase 1 studies (CEC -1; CEC -2) no serious adverse events (SAEs) have

4.[ADDRESS_586659] crossover study  in 
healt hy adult participants is to determine if the systemic exposure to TAK -227 will be altered 
when dosed with a high- fat/high -calorie meal or under fasting condit ions. TAK -[ADDRESS_586660] scenari o if the dosing is conducted 
prior to a m eal (current dosing condit ions are fo llowed; Treatment C) and fo llowing a m eal 
(current d osing condit ions are not fo llowed; Treatment B). Enrolled participants will each 
receive a single oral dose of TAK -227 in each of the 3 treatment periods. The dosing in each 
treatm ent peri od will be separated by  a washout peri od of  not l ess than 4 days (single-dose 
plasma TAK -227 half -life of 5 to 8 hours). Participants will be dosed at approximately the same 
time each morning on Day  1 of each treatm ent period, wi th the dosing of each part icipant timed 
for sequential PK sampling. Thus, TAK -227 PK will  be evaluated under 3 different feeding 
condi tions:
Fasting (Treatment A)
Fed pre -dose, high -fat/high -calorie meal  administered 30 minutes prior to dosing (Treatment 
B)
Fed post -dose, high -fat/high -calorie meal administered ~30 minutes after dosing (Treatment 
C)
The high -fat/high -calorie meal shoul d contain in total  800-1000 kCal  with 500-600 kCal  from 
fat, 250 kCal from carbohydrates, and 150 kCal from proteins [ FDA, 2022].
4.3 Benefit/Risk Profile
The [ADDRESS_586661] 
healt h benefit to the healt hy participants enro lled in this study is the free medical tests received at 
screening and during the study .
The inclusio n and exclusio n criteria, screening, and safet y monitoring practices emplo yed in this 
protocol  (ie, 12 -lead ECG, vital signs, clinical laboratory tests, AE monitoring, and physical 
examinat ion) are considered adequate to protect the participant’s safety  and shoul d detect all

6.0 STUDY DESIGN AND DES CRIPTION
6.1 Study Design 
This is a single -center, open -label, single -dose, randomized, 3 -period, 6 -sequence, crossover 
study  in healthy adul ts.
Study  schemat ic and dose regimens are shown in
 Table 2.aand  Table 2.b. The schedule of 
assessments is shown in Schedule of Stud y Procedures (Section 3.0).
On Day  1 of Treatment Peri od 1 parti cipants will be randomly assigned to one of 6 possible 
treatm ent sequences ( Table 8.a). On Day  1 of each treatment period, a single dose of TAK-227 
will be administered orally under one of 3 different feeding condit ions as per the randomization 
schedule:
Fasting (Treatment A),
Fed pre -dose, high -fat/high -calorie meal  administered 30 minutes prior to dosing 
(Treatm entB), and
Fed post -dose, high -fat/high -calorie meal administered ~30 minutes after dosing 
(Treatm entC).
For details on food and water consumpt ion in the different treatments refer to Section 7.4.[ADDRESS_586670] all part icipants (including participants who terminate the study  early) 
7(±3) days after the last TAK -[ADDRESS_586671] study  visit. If clinically significant findings are observed upon disch arge, parti cipants

CONFIDENTIALA pretreatment event (PTE) is defined as any  untoward medical occurrence in a clinical 
investigat ion participant who has signed the ICF to participate in a study  but before 
administration of any  study  drug; i t does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with 
study  participati on.
An untoward finding generally may:
Indica te a new di agnosis or unexpected worsening of a preexist ing condit ion. (Intermittent 
events for pre -exist ing condit ions or underlying disease should not be considered AEs.)
Necessitate therapeutic intervent ion.
Requi re an invasive diagnostic procedure.
Require discont inuat ion or a change in dose of study  medicat ion or a concomitant 
medicat ion.
Be considered unfavorable by [CONTACT_47392].
Diagnoses versus signs and symptoms:
Each event should be recorded to represent a single diagnosis. Acco mpanying signs 
(including abnormal laboratory  values or ECG findings) or symptoms should NOT be 
recorded as additional AEs. If a diagnosis is unknown, sign(s) or symptom(s) should be 
recorded appropriately as an AE(s).
Laboratory  values and ECG findings:
Changes in laboratory  values or ECG param eters maybe considered AEs if they are judged to 
be clinically  significant (i e, if som e act ion or intervent ion is required or if the Invest igator 
judges the change to be beyo nd the range of normal physio logic fluctua tion). A l aboratory  
re-test and/or continued monitoring o f an abnormal value are not considered an intervention. 
In addit ion, repeated or addit ional noninvasive testing for verificat ion, evaluat ion or 
monitoring of an abnormalit y is not considered an inter vention.
If abnorm al laboratory  values or ECG findings are the result of pathology  for which there is 
an overall diagnosis (eg, increased creatinine in renal failure), the diagnosis only should be 
reported appropriately  as an AE.
Pre-exist ing condit ions:
Apre-exist ing condit ion (present at the time of signing the ICF) is considered a concurrent 
medical history  condi tion and shoul d NOT be recorded as an AE. A baseline evaluat ion (eg, 
laboratory  test, ECG, X -ray, etc) shoul d NOT be recorded as an AE unless r elated to a study  
procedure. However, if the participant experiences a worsening or complicat ion of such a 
concurrent medical history  condi tion, the worsening or complicat ion should be recorded 
appropriately  as an AE (worsening or complicat ion occurs after the ICF is signed). 
Invest igators should ensure that the event term recorded captures the change in the condit ion 
(eg, “worsening of…”).

CONFIDENTIALIf a participant has a pre -exist ing epi[INVESTIGATOR_45283] (eg, asthma, epi[INVESTIGATOR_002] ), any occurrence of 
an epi[INVESTIGATOR_459361] y be captured as an AE if the epi[INVESTIGATOR_4070], serious, 
or severe in nature, that is, Investigators should ensure that the AE term recorded captures the 
change from Baseline in the condit ion (eg “worsening of…”).
If a participant has a degene rative concurrent condit ion (eg, cataracts, rheumatoid arthrit is), 
worsening of the condit ion shoul d only  be captured as an AE if occurring to a greater extent 
to that which would be expected. Again, Invest igators should ensure that the AE term 
recorded ca ptures the change in the condit ion (eg, “worsening o f…”).
Worsening of AEs:
If the participant experiences a worsening or complicat ion of an AE after the first 
administration of study  medicati on or after any  change in study  medicat ion, the worsening or 
complicat ion shoul d be recorded as a new AE. Investigators should ensure that the AE term 
recorded captures the change in the condit ion (eg, “worsening o f…”).
Changes in severit y of AEs:
If the participant experiences a change in the severit y of an AE that i snot associated with a 
change in study  medicati on, the event shoul d be captured once with the maximum severit y 
recorded.
Prepl anned surgeries or procedures:
Prepl anned procedures (surgeries or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) that were scheduled prior to signing of the 
ICF are not considered AEs. However, if a preplanned procedure is performed early (eg, as 
an emergency) due to a worsening of the pre- exist ing condit ion, the worsening of the 
condi tion shoul d be captured appropriately  as an AE. Com plicat ions result ing from any 
planned surgery  should be reported as AEs.
Elect ive surgeries or procedures:
Elect ive procedures performed where there is no change in the participant’s medical 
condi tion shoul d not be recorded as AEs but should be documented in the participant’s 
source docum ents. Com plicat ions result ing from an elect ive surgery should be reported as 
AEs.
Overdose:
An overdose is defined as a known deliberate or accidental administration of study drug, to 
or by  a study parti cipant, at a dose above the maximum scheduled dose be ing used in this 
study  irrespect ive of the participant’s assigned according to the study protocol. It is up to the 
Invest igator or the reporting physician to decide whether a dose is to be considered an 
overdose or considered as a medicat ion dosing error, in consultation wit h the Sponsor.
All cases of overdose (with or without associated AEs) will be documented on an overdose

10.2.1 Assigning Severity/Intensity of AEs
The different categories o f severit y/intensity are:
Mild: An adverse ev ent that i s usually transient and may require only  minimal 
treatm ent or therapeutic intervent ion. The event does not generally interfere 
with usual  activi ties of  daily living.
Moderate: An adverse event that is usually alleviated with addit ional specific therapeut ic 
intervent ion. The event interferes wit h usual activit ies of daily living, causing 
discomfort but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the research 
participant.
Severe: An adverse event that interrupts usual activit ies of daily living, or si gnificant ly 
affects clinical status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention.
10.2.2 Assigning Causality of AEs
The rel ationship of each AE to study  medicati on(s) will be assessed using the fo llowing 
categori es:
Related: An AE that fo llowsa reasonable tem poral  sequence from  administrati on of  a 
drug (including the course after withdrawal o f the drug), or for whi ch a causal  
relationship is at least a reasonable possibilit y, ie, the relati onship cannot be

administration of a drug and/or that can reasonably b e explained by  [CONTACT_209790], such as underlying diseases, complicat ions, concomitant medicat ions 
and concurrent treatments.
In addit ion, rel ationship (causalit y) to COVID -[ADDRESS_586716] igator considers that there is 
reasonable possibilit y that an event i s due to COVID -19. Otherwise, the relationship should be 
assessed as not related.
Similarly, relat ionship (causalit y) to COVID -[ADDRESS_586717] igator determines that the event or 
events are related or possible related to COVID -19 or the COVID -19 vaccine, the events should 
be assessed as not related to the study  drug. If the AE is related to COVID -19 vaccinat ion, 
specific verbat im term(s) should be used, eg, post -vaccination fever, vaccinat ion site burning.
10.2.[ADDRESS_586718] signs/symptoms were noted by  [CONTACT_324012]/or Invest igator.

applicable) must be signed and dated by  [CONTACT_17071], or the parti cipant’s l egally acceptable 
representative, at the time of consent and prior to the participant entering into the study . The 
participant or the participant’s legally acceptable representative should be instructed to sign 
using their legal names, not nicknames, using blu e or bl ack ballpoint ink. The Investigator must 
also sign and date the ICF and participant authorization (if applicable) at the time of consent and 
prior to parti cipant entering into the study; however, the Sponsor may  allow a designee of the 
Invest igator to sign to the extent permitted by  [CONTACT_1289].
Once signed, the original ICF, participant authorization form (if applicable), and participant 
inform ation sheet (if applicable) will be stored in the Invest igator’s site file. The Invest igator 
must docum ent the date the participant signs the ICF in the participant’s medical record. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_459362], the signed participant authorizatio n form (if applicable), and participant 
inform ation sheet (if applicable) shall be given to the participant.
All revised ICFs must be reviewed and signed by  [CONTACT_459388]’s l egally acceptable representative in the same manner as the original informed 
consent. The date the revised consent was ob tained shoul d be recorded in the pa rticipant’s 
medical record, and the participant should receive a copy  of the revised ICF.
13.3 Participant Confidentiality
The Sponsor and designees affirm and upho ld the principle of the participant’s right to protection 
against invasio n of privacy. Throughout this study , a parti cipant’s source data will only be linked 
to the Sponsor’s clinical study  database or docum entati on via a unique ident ificat ion number. As 
permitted by  [CONTACT_1763], limited participant attributes, such as sex, age , 
or date of birth, and participant init ials may be used to verify the participant and accuracy o f the 
participant’s unique ident ification number.

Female Participants and Their Male Partners
From  signing of the ICF, throughout the duration of the study , and for [ADDRESS_586752] dose of 
study  drug, female part icipants of childbearing potent ial* who are sexually act ive with a

In addit ion they  must be advised not to donate ova during this period.
Definitions and Procedures for Contraception and Pregnancy Avoidance
The follow ing definitions apply for contraception and pregnancy avoidance procedures.
* A female is considered a female of childbearing potential, i.e. fert ile, fo llowing menarche and 
until becoming post -menopausal unless permanently  sterile. Perm anent sterilizat ion methods 
include hysterectomy , bilateral  tubal  ligation, bilateral  salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656] , hysteroscopi c sterilization,
and bilateral oophorectomy . A postm enopausal  state i s defined as no menses for [ADDRESS_586753] imulat ing hormone (FSH) le vel in the 
postm enopausal range (FSH >40 IU/L) may be used to confirm a post -menopausal state in 
younger females (eg, those <45 y ear ol d) or females who are not using hormonal contraception 
or horm onal replacement therapy . However, in the absence of 12 mon ths of  amenorrhea, a single 
FSH m easurement is insufficient.

that resul t in a l ow failure rate (i e, less than 1% failure rate per y ear when used consistent ly 
and correctly). In this study , where medicat ions and devices containing hormones are 
included, the only  acceptable methods of contraception are: 
Non-Hormonal Methods: 
–Intrauterine device (IUD).

Horm onal Methods: Horm onal contracepti on m ay be suscept ible to interaction with the 
investigat ive co mpound, comparator, concomitant medicat ions, which may reduce the 
efficacy  of the contracepti on method.
–Combined (estrogen and progestogen) hormonal contraception associated with

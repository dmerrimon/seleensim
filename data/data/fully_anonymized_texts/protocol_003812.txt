6 1.0 INTRODUCTION 
This document details the analysis plan for the study entitled “ A Comparison of Direct 
Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_564204]. Stent Retriever as a First Approach ("COMPASS") ”. It describes the proposed 
efficacy and safety analyses.  
Acute ischemic stroke remains a potentially devastating condition and is a leading cause of 
morbidity and mortality affecting an estimated 800,000 people per year in the [LOCATION_002] alone and costing an estimated $41 billion in 2007.[1 ] The most devastating strokes are generally 
those caused by [CONTACT_769494]. The natural history of untreated or unrevascularized large vessel occlusions in acute stroke patients results in mortality rates approaching 30% and only 25% of patients achieving good neurologic outcomes at 90 days.[2 , 3] Intravenous (IV) tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) administration is approved 
for use within 3 hours of symptom onset, with newer evidence suggesting potential benefit out to 4.5 hours.[1 , 4-6] However, IV tPA does a poor job of effectively revascularizing large vessel 
occlusions.[7] Among patients presenting within the approved time window, close to half are ineligible to receive IV tPA due to exclusionary criteria.  Until recently, there had not been a single trial showing efficacy of intra-arterial thrombectomy (IAT) over medical therapy. The MR CLEAN trial showed an absolute difference of 13.5% in 
rate of functional independence in favor of IAT over medical therapy (32.6% vs 19.1%). MR 
CLEAN was notable in that it randomized 500 patients in the Netherlands to IV tPA vs. IV tPA and IAT presenting within 6 hours of stroke onset.[8] More robustly, the ESCAPE trial favored IAT over medical therapy by [CONTACT_136063] 2.6 with a significant reduction in mortality (10.4% vs 19.0%). The ESCAPE trial was halted after enrolling [ADDRESS_1055961] patients with large vessel occlusion ( LVO ) and ability to rapi[INVESTIGATOR_769484] 30 
minutes.[9] Similarly, the EXTEND IA trial based in Australia was halted after 70 patients were enrolled due to the reported positive results in the MR CLEAN trial. Interim analysis found a marked improvement in ability to achieve functional outcome with IAT (71%) over medical therapy (40%).[10] These trials all utilized advanced imaging to select appropriate patients, and stent retrievers were used for thrombectomy in the majority of cases.  ADAPT is an approach that utilizes the advantages of large bore aspi[INVESTIGATOR_769485] a vacuum phenomenon. If this application is not directly effective, then it maintains the thrombus engaged 
in the catheter tip through suction, and the clot is removed as the catheter is pulled out of the 
body. In the minority of cases where the application of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_769486], then the large aspi[INVESTIGATOR_769487] a conduit for use of a stent retriever at the location of the thrombus. Initial experience with this approach has shown promising results; however, randomized or direct comparison studies have not been done.[11, 12]  ADAPT, while encompassing the advantages of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_769488] a first line therapy. While inherently suggestive, supportive data on the benefit of DocuSign Envelope ID: 165A504E-3F26-48F7-898A-B0DE14329815
 
[ADDRESS_1055962] line approach. 
2.0 STUDY OBJECTIVES 
Primary Objective: The primary objective is to show that acute ischemic stroke ( AIS) patients, 
with appropriate image selection, treated with ADAPT approach within [ADDRESS_1055963]-line stent retriever with 90-day global disability assessed via the modified Rankin Scale score (mRS), analyzed using success criteria as mRS 0 to 2.  Secondary Objective: The secondary objective is to evaluate whether the ADAPT approach is 
technically superior, clinically superior, or more cost effective than stent retriever as a first line 
approach in the treatment of AIS.  
3.[ADDRESS_1055964] line approach (SRFL) in patients presenting with AIS within 6 hours of symptom onset. Any cleared mechanical stent retriever (SR) or aspi[INVESTIGATOR_769489]’s region of 
practice is approved for use.   
A total of approximately 270 subjects will be enrolled at up to 20 centers. 
 
The schedule of events for this study is presented in Table 1.  DocuSign Envelope ID: 165A504E-3F26-48F7-898A-B0DE14329815

9 3.2 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment 
Subjects will be randomized in a 1:[ADDRESS_1055967] line (SR FL) approach group.  
3.3 Blinding 
This study is a blinded-assess trial. To avoid bias in the study results, the person performing the 
primary outcome assessment (as well as NIHSS) at [ADDRESS_1055968]’s 
treatment assignment and will not have been associated with the care of the subject during the 
acute treatment phase. All core-lab evaluations will also be blinded.  
3.4 Determination of Sample Size 
For this study, the sample size was determined by [CONTACT_769496] 0 to 2 at the 90-day follow-up visit (referred to as a success) are similar 
to the rate of 32.6% (76/233) from recent data from the MR CLEAN trial. The sample size 
calculations assumed that 33% of ADAPT patients experience success (mRS 0 to 2) and 33% of SRFL  patients experience success. Based on a one-sided, normal approximation test for non-
inferiority with a non-inferiority margin of 15% and alpha=0.05, [ADDRESS_1055969] 80% power. The sample size was adjusted to 135 patients per treatment group to account for up to 10% attrition. Assuming that the observed success rate for both the ADAPT arm and the SR FL arm is 33% (40/122), the 90% normal approximation confidence interval for 
the true difference in percentages between treatments is (-9.9%, 9.9%). Sample size was computed using SAS version 9.4.  
3.[ADDRESS_1055970] been incorrectly assessed in regards to 
inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
The protocol defined percent lesion change as follows: 100 x [[ADDRESS_1055971] Volume - Pretreatment Core Lesion Volume]/[ADDRESS_1055972] 
Volume. Instead the denominator will be Pretreatment Core Lesion volume.  
In order to utilize a positive non-inferiority margin rather than a negative non-inferiority margin, 
the null and alternative hypotheses were revised to the equivalent but simpler specification as follows:   H
0:     p c – p t ≥ 0.15 
and  H
1:     p c – p t < 0.15. 
where p t and p c represent the true success proportions for treatment (ADAPT) and control 
(SRFL ), respectively. These hypotheses are entirely equivalent to those in the protocol. DocuSign Envelope ID: 165A504E-3F26-48F7-898A-B0DE14329815
 
10 According to the protocol, the null hypothesis was to be tested using a binomial comparison. 
Instead, this endpoint will be analyzed using a logistic regression model with the following terms 
in the model: treatment, ASPECTS score at baseline, patient age, sidedness, and any other 
baseline characteristic for which there is a statistically significant difference between treatments.   
Secondary efficacy endpoints/outcomes were listed but not rigidly explained in the protocol. To 
further clarify we have pre-specified four Secondary Efficacy Endpoints and eight additional Secondary Efficacy Outcomes, as well as Safety Outcomes and Cost Outcome. We also have added 90-day utility weighted mRS, TICI [ADDRESS_1055973] for multiplicity. Instead, the secondary 
efficacy endpoints will be analyzed using Holm's stepwise testing procedure to take the 
multiplicity into account . [13] 
4.0 ENDPOINTS AND OUTCOMES 
4.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint is mRS success, defined as a mRS score of 0 to 2 at the 90-day 
follow-up visit.   
 
4.2 Secondary Ef ficacy Endpoints 
 
• Time from groin puncture to thrombolysis in cerebral infarction ( TICI ) 2b or better 
revascularization • 90-day global disability assessed via the overall distribution of mRS  • TICI 2c or greater revascularization within 45 minutes of access. • TICI 3 revascularization within 45 minutes of access.

• Mortality rates at [ADDRESS_1055980] -randomization 
• Treatment -related serious adverse events (SAEs) up to [ADDRESS_1055981]-randomization 
• Procedure -related SAEs 
 
4.[ADDRESS_1055982] for visit windows. The statistical analysis of the data obtained from this study will be performed using SAS® version 9.[ADDRESS_1055983] for non-
inferiority of ADAPT to SRFL  with adjustment for the following baseline covariates : ASPECTS 
score, patient age, sidedness, and any other baseline characteristic for which there is a 
statistically significant difference (two-sided p-value < 0.05) between treatments.  
The following secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed using a logistic regression model to 
test for a difference between treatments with adjustment for clot location: TICI 2b or greater revascularization within 45 minutes of access, TICI 2c or greater revascularization within 45 
minutes of access, and TICI 3 revascularization within 45 minutes of access. 
5.3 Handling of Dropouts and Missing Data 
Under the Intent- to-Treat (ITT) principle, all patients who are randomized are to be included in 
the analysis. Therefore, missing data, especially in the outcome measures, can be problematic. 
Every effort is to be made to keep all missing data, particularly the Day 90 outcomes, to a 
minimum. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_769490]’ best efforts, some missing  data may be inevitable, mainly 
due to lost- to-follow-up (LTFU). The number and proportion of subjects eligible for and 
compliant with each follow-up examination will be presented. Subjects who withdraw from the study will be tabulated along with the reasons for withdrawal. For the primary efficacy endpoint, DocuSign Envelope ID: 165A504E-3F26-48F7-898A-B0DE14329815
 
[ADDRESS_1055984] (LOCF) method, i.e., using the mRS value as of the last available follow-up visit or discharge (whichever is later). A sensitivity analysis will be performed in which subjects with missing data for the primary efficacy endpoint will be scored as mRS 6, i.e., a failure. A second sensitivity analysis will be performed in which subjects with missing data for the primary efficacy endpoint will be excluded.   For the primary analyses of the secondary efficacy endpoints, subjects with missing data for the endpoint will be excluded from the analysis. A sensitivity analysis will be performed for the following secondary efficacy endpoints: TICI 2c or greater revascularization within [ADDRESS_1055985] (DSMB) will receive periodic safety reports of all adverse events (AEs) and SAEs. In addition, the treatment-related SAEs occurring within 48 hours of randomization will be monitored as a safety outcome along with the following:  
• Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage within 24 hours of randomization • Asymptomatic intracranial hemorrhage within 24 hours of randomization • Mortality rates at [ADDRESS_1055986]-randomization 
• Mortality rates at [ADDRESS_1055987]-randomization 
• Treatment-related SAEs during the study • All SAEs during the study • Major non- intracranial hemorrhage bleeding complications during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] • Recurrent stroke within 90 days of randomization 
 
5.5 Multicenter Study 
This is a multicenter study. It is planned to enroll approximately 270 subjects at up to 20 clinical 
study sites.   
5.6 Multiple Comparisons / Multiplicity 
Formal hypothesis tests will be performed for the secondary efficacy endpoints only if the null 
hypothesis is rejected for the primary efficacy endpoint, and the analysis of the secondary 
efficacy endpoints will be performed with adjustment for multiple comparisons using Holm's stepwise testing procedure. No other adjustments for multiple comparisons/multiplicity will be made.  
5.7 Examination of Subgroups 
No subgroup analyses are planned. 
 DocuSign Envelope ID: 165A504E-3F26-48F7-898A-B0DE14329815
 
13 5.8 Definition of Baseline Measurements 
For assessments scheduled to be performed at the baseline visit, but not the randomization visit, 
the baseline value is defined as the value at the baseline visit.   For assessments scheduled to be 
performed at the randomization visit, but not at the baseline visit, the baseline value is defined as 
the value at the randomization visit. 
6.0 ANALYSIS POPULATIONS 
6.1 Intent- to-Treat (ITT)  
The ITT population will include all randomized subjects. The ITT population will be the primary 
analysis population for the efficacy endpoints, the cost outcome, and the safety outcomes, and subjects will be analyzed according to the treatment group to which they were assigned at 
randomization. 
6.2 Per Protocol (PP) 
The Per Protocol (PP) population will include all randomized subjects who do not have the 
following protocol violations or deviations:   
a. Eligibility violation b. Treatment crossover, defined as receiving, as initial treatment, the study treatment to which the subject was not randomized c. Missing 90 day primary outcome (not including missing due to death prior to the 90 days)    
 The PP population will be used for a secondary analysis of the efficacy endpoints, and subjects 
will be analyzed according to the treatment group to which they were assigned at randomization.   
7.[ADDRESS_1055988] DISPOSITION 
Patients who are randomized will be considered enrolled. All subjects who are enrolled will be 
accounted for. The frequency and percentage of subjects eligible for and compliant with each 
follow-up examination will be presented. 
The number and percentage of randomized subjects in the ITT and Per Protocol populations will 
be presented for each treatment group. The numbers and percentages of randomized subjects who complete the study and who withdraw from the study early, together with the reason for 
withdrawal, will be presented by [CONTACT_1570].  
The reason(s) for exclusion from the PP Population will be summarized using counts and 
percentage for randomized subjects. 
8.0 DEMOGRAPHIC AND BASELINE CHARACTERISTICS 
Demographic and baseline characteristics, including medical history and clinical evaluation, will 
be summarized using descriptive statistics for continuous variables and frequencies and percentages for categorical variables. Fisher's Exact Test will be used to test for a difference in proportions between treatments for dichotomous variables. The Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel row mean scores test will be used to test for a difference in means between treatments for ordinal DocuSign Envelope ID: 165A504E-3F26-48F7-898A-B0DE14329815

9.0 PROCEDURE  
Procedural details will be summarized by [CONTACT_769497]. For categorical variables, the odds ratio (ADAPT vs. SR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval will be presented, together with the p-value from a two-sided chi-square test for a difference in true percentages between treatments. Continuous variables will be analyzed using a two-sided, two-sample t-test to test for a difference in means between treatments.  
10.0 EFFICACY ANALYSES 
10.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
The primary effectiveness endpoint is mRS success, defined as a mRS score of 0 to 2 at the 90-
day follow-up visit. The number and proportion of patients in each treatment group who are a 
success will be calculated and the 90% confidence interval for the difference in proportions between treatment groups will be presented. The null and alternative hypotheses for this endpoint are as follows:   H
0:     p c – p t ≥ 0.15 
and  H
1:     p c – p t < 0.15 
 where p
t and p c represent the true success proportions for treatment (ADAPT) and control 
(SRFL ), respectively. This endpoint will be analyzed using a logistic regression model with the DocuSign Envelope ID: 165A504E-3F26-48F7-898A-B0DE14329815
 
15 following terms in the model: treatment, ASPECTS score at baseline, patient age, sidedness, and 
any other baseline characteristic for which there is a statistically significant difference between 
treatments. The p-value for the test of the null hypothesis will be obtained based on a statistic for the difference (control - treatment) in least squares means (actually proportions rather than means) for each treatment minus the non-inferiority margin of 0.[ADDRESS_1055990] is essentially equivalent to evaluating whether the lower bound of the 90% confidence interval based on the normal approximation for the true difference in least squares 
means between treatments is less than 0.15. 
Subjects deceased during study follow-up will be scored as mRS 6, as per the standard scoring 
for mRS. For subjects missing data for the primary efficacy endpoint, missing values will be imputed using the Last-Observation-Carried Forward (LOCF) method, i.e., using the mRS value 
as of the last available follow-up visit or discharge (whichever is later). A sensitivity analysis 
will be performed for the ITT Population in which subjects with missing data for the primary efficacy endpoint will be scored as mRS 6, i.e., a failure. A second sensitivity analysis will be performed in which subjects with missing data for the primary efficacy endpoint will be excluded. 
 
10.2 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
The secondary efficacy endpoints are presented in Section 4.2. Time from groin puncture to 
thrombolysis in cerebral infarction ( TICI ) 2b or better revascularization will be analyzed using 
the Kaplan-Meier method, and the log-rank test will be used to test for a difference between treatments. 90-day global disability assessed via the overall distribution of mRS, will be 
summarized using descriptive statistics, and the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel row mean scores test 
will be used to test for a difference in means between treatments. TICI 2c or greater revascularization within [ADDRESS_1055991] for a difference in proportions between treatments. For these two endpoints, the odds ratio (ADAPT vs. SR FL) and corresponding 95% 
confidence interval will be presented.  A sensitivity analysis will be performed for the ITT Population for the se same two endpoints in which subjects with missing data will be classified as 
a failure. For the primary analyses of the secondary efficacy endpoints, subjects with missing data for the endpoint will be excluded from the analysis.   Formal hypothesis tests will be performed for the secondary efficacy endpoints only if the null 
hypothesis is rejected for the primary efficacy endpoint.   
 Holm's stepwise testing procedure will be used to adjust the significance levels of the tests in the analysis of the secondary efficacy endpoints in order to take multiplicity into account. Holm's procedure is conducted as follows. The ordered p-values p
(1), p(2), p(3), and p (4) will be obtained, 
where the ordering is from least to greatest. The testing procedure begins with the null hypothesis associated with the most significant p-value, i.e., with H
(1). This hypothesis is rejected 
if p (1)≤0.05/4 . If H (1) is not rejected, stop the hypothesis testing. Otherwise, proceed to test H (2), 
which will be rejected if p (2)≤0.05/3.  If H (2) is not rejected, stop the hypothesis testing. 
Otherwise, proceed to test H (3), which will be rejected if p (3)≤0.05 /2. If H (3) is not rejected, stop DocuSign Envelope ID: 165A504E-3F26-48F7-898A-B0DE14329815
 
[ADDRESS_1055992] H (4), which will be rejected if p (4)≤0.05 /1. If the 
null hypothesis is rejected for a given secondary efficacy endpoint, p-values for subsequent 
endpoints will be presented for descriptive purposes only.    
10.[ADDRESS_1055993] for a difference in proportions between treatments. The odds ratio (ADAPT vs. SR FL) and corresponding 95% confidence interval will 
be presented. The other secondary efficacy outcomes will be summarized using descriptive 
statistics and will be analyzed using a two-sided, two-sample t-test to test for a difference in 
means between treatments.   
11.0 SAFETY ANALYSES 
Primary safety outcomes are listed in Section 4.4. Each of these outcomes will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_769498], together with the odds ratio (ADAPT vs. SR FL) 
and corresponding 95% confidence interval.

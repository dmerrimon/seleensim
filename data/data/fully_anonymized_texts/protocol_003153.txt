 OBSEVA  CONFIDENTIAL  4 SYNOPSIS  
Study Title:  A double -blind randomized extension study to assess the long -term efficacy and safety 
of linzagolix in subjects with endometriosis -associated pain  
Code/ Name [CONTACT_304763]:  linzagolix  (OBE2109)  Phase of Development:  3 
Objectives:  
The primary objective of this extension study is to assess the maintenance of efficacy of linzagolix 
administered orally once daily for up to an additional 6 months (for up to 12 months of treatment in 
total) in women who have already completed 6 months of linzagolix treatment at a dose of 75 mg 
alone or of 200 mg in combination wit h add-back therapy (estradiol ( E2) 1 mg / norethisterone acetate 
(NETA) 0.5 mg)  in the management of moderate to severe endometriosis -associated pain  (EAP ) in 
women with surgically confirmed endometriosis. The two co -primary efficacy endpoints will be 
clinically meaningful reduction over the last 28 days of randomized treatment up to the Month 12 
visit, along with a stable or decreased use of analgesics for EAP,  for 1) dysmenorrhea ( DYS ) and for 
2) non menstrual pelvic pain ( NMPP ).  
Secondary objectives include evaluation of efficacy over the last 28 days of randomized treatment 
up to the Month 12 visit  based on the following parameters:  evaluation of pain associated with sex ual 
intercourse (dyspareunia) and def ecation (dysc hezia), difficulty of doing daily activities, analgesic 
use, assessment of subject perception of severity, change in uterine ble eding, Quality of Life (QoL) 
questionnaires, pharmacoeconomic burden of endomet riosis by [CONTACT_684076], asse ssment of endometriosis -related number of non -study health visits, number of days 
in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_684028] . 
Safety and tolerability objectives include assessment of bone mineral density ( BMD ), endomet rial 
health, cardiac safety  including QT interval prolongation, standard laboratory safety parameters, 
gynecological assessments and adverse event ( AE) frequency including specific hypoestrogenic A Es. 
Exploratory objectives include assessment of bone turnover markers  and collection of 
pharmacokinetic ( PK) and pharmacodynamic ( PD) related data of linzagolix for a separate modelling 
exercise . 
Endpoints : 
Efficacy endpoints   
 Primary  efficacy endpoints :  
The two co -primary , composite,  efficacy endpoints are clinically meaningful reduction  from 
baseline to the last 28 days preceding the  Month 12 visit (the 4 -week period preceding Month 12 
visit), along with a stable or decreased use of analgesics for EAP, in the mean daily assessment 
of 1) DYS and of 2) NMPP , both  measured on a Verbal Rating Scale (VRS)  using an electronic 
diary ( eDiary ).

month  treatment extension . 
The extension study  starts at the Month 6  visit of the main study. Subjects will be required to sign a 
specific informed consent form (ICF) for this extension  study . Only subjects who have completed the 
full 6-month Treatment Period  in the main study and meet the inclusion criteria will be eligible for 
entry  in the extension study . 
All subjects will receive once daily either linzagolix 75 mg alone (with ABT placebo) or 200 mg 
combined with ABT for 6 months.  Subjects who received placebo during the main study will be 
random ized to either linzagolix 75 mg alone (with ABT placebo) or linzagolix 200 mg with ABT.  
Subjects who received active treatment during the main study will continue with the same treatment . 
Linzagolix/placebo  tablets will be provided in monthly treatment kits, packaged, labelled and 
administered in the same manner to protect the blinded nature of the trial.

administered orally once daily for up to an additional 6 months (for up to 12 months of treatment in 
total)  in the subset of subjects who are treated with linzagolix up to the time point of interest . As such, 
the focus will be on subjects who received active treatment in the main study. The assessment of 
subjects who switched from placebo in the main study to active treatment in the extension study will 
be conducted as a sec ondary objective.  
No formal hypothesis tests are planned for this extension study. Data will be summari zed by [CONTACT_770612]. Subjects will be analyzed according to actual treatment received. The 
following four treatment groups will be analyzed: linzagolix 75 mg and linzagolix 200 mg with ABT 
fixed dose groups, linzagolix 75 mg and linzag olix 200 mg with ABT after 6 months  of placebo 
treatment . Only subjects with assessments at both baseline and the given time points will be included 
in the summaries.  Baseline values are the same as in the main study (18 -OBE2109 -003 - Edelweiss 3) , 
i.e. da ta collected prior to the treatment administration  in the main study.  
Efficacy analysis methodology  
Summaries will be performed using the Treatment Extension Analysis Set and the Follow -up 
Extension Analysis Set. Data from both the main study and the extension study will be summari zed. 
Efficacy endpoints will be derived in the same way as in the main study. The same criterion for 
defining a subject as being a responder by  [CONTACT_7661] a clinically meaningful reduction in DYS and in 
NMPP, along with a stable or decreased use of analgesics for EAP, will be used as per the criteria  in 
the main study.  
Safety analysis methodology  
Summaries will be performed using the Extension Safety Analysis Set and the Follow -up Extension 
Analysis Set.  
Data from both the main s tudy and the extension study will be summari zed. 
Pharmacokinetic analysis methodology  
Descriptive statistics of plasma concentrations will include mean (arithmetic and geometric) and 
standard deviation, median, 1st and 3rd quartiles, minimum, maximum, coefficient of variation (CV%) 
and number of observations. Concentrations below the limit of quantification (LOQ) will be assigned 
a value of zero. Explorative analyses of correlations between plasma concentrations and intrinsic PK

 OBSEVA  CONFIDENTIAL  factors such as e.g. bod y weight/body mass index (BMI) , race, age may be performed, as appropriate, 
and will be reported separately.  
PK analyses will be based on the Extension PK Set.  
Pharmacodynamic (and other) analysis methodology  
Pharmacodynamic parameters, such as for example estradiol and other hormones, will be summarized 
by [CONTACT_770613], and listed for each subject by [CONTACT_112799]. 
Where appropriate, changes from baseline will be presented. Potential  PK-PD relationships may be 
investigated graphically and through statistical modeling, whilst also exploring possible covariates, 
and will be reported separately . 
Study Specific Data Analyses  
End-of-Treatment Period Analysis  
After all subjects hav e completed the Treatment Period, a complete analysis will be performed. This 
analysis will include all data up to the end of treatment visit. A database lock will be performed, with 
any discrepant data clarified before the lock.  
Post-Treatment Follow -up P eriod Analysis  
After all subjects have completed the Post-Treatment Follow -up Period, a final database lock will be 
performed followed by a second analysis. This analysis will include all data collected during the Post-
Treatment Follow -up Period.

 OBSEVA  CONFIDENTIAL  5 BACKGROUND INFORMATI ON 
5.1 INTRODUCTION  TO LINZAGOLIX  
Linzagolix  is a new , orally active, non -peptide  gonadotropin releasing h ormone  (GnRH ) antagonist. It 
has been shown to significantly reduce endometriosis -associated pain (EAP) in women  with surgically 
confirmed endometriosis at once daily doses between 50  and 200 mg  with a good safety and tolerability 
profile.  It is being developed for the long-term treatment of moderate  to severe EAP. 
5.2 ENDOMETRIOSIS  
Endometriosis is a chronic disease with debilitating pelvic pain symptoms (such as dysmenorrhea, 
dyspareunia, non -menstrual pelvic pain, dyschezia) affecting quality of life and r equir ing long-term 
management .  
5.[ADDRESS_1057650]-line medical thera pi[INVESTIGATOR_770593]  (COCs) and  progestins , have 
limited long -term efficacy , and second -line therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (eg, high -dose progestins,  injectable depot 
formulations of GnRH  receptor agonists) are effective  but associated with troublesome side effects 
including  progressive bone loss and severe vasomotor symptoms  (1, 2). 
GnRH receptor antagonists are a new potential treatment option allow ing dose-dependent reduction  of 
estradiol ( E2) levels alleviating  EAP ( 3) whilst reducing the negative impact on bone mineral density 
(BMD) .  
For long term use of GnRH -analogues, concurrent treatment with add -back (progestin and/or estrogen) 
hormone replacement th erapy (ABT) has been shown to be effective in reducing associated BMD loss 
(4,5) and is generally recommended as part of long-term treatment with GnRH receptor agonists to 
minimize side effects.  
Linzagolix is a new, orally active, GnRH receptor antagonist.  In Phase 1 and 2 studies, it  was shown to 
dose-dependently  suppress luteinizing hormone  (LH) and E2  and to significantly reduce EAP  in women  
with moderate  to severe EAP,  with a good safety and tolerability profile  (see section 5.5.2  and 5.5.3 ).  
The purpose of the present study is to collect long -term (up to 12 months) data on the safety and efficacy 
of linzagolix in subjects with EAP. This is a 6-month active treatment extension study  offered to all 
subjects who have completed 6 -month s of active or non -active  treatment in study 18 -OBE2109 -003 
(Edelweiss 3).

 OBSEVA  CONFIDENTIAL  but no over t toxicity. No genotoxicity or unexpected reproduction toxicology findings in rats and rabbits 
were seen.  
In conclusion, the nonclinical package supports clini cal long-term dosing regimens up to 200 mg per 
day. 
5.5 SUMMARY OF CLINICAL STUDIES  
The efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics (PK)  of linzagolix were investigated by [CONTACT_770614] (Kissei Pharmaceutical Co., LTD. from Japan) in two Phase 1 studies (Study KLH1101 and 
KLH1103) in Japanese and/or Caucasian volunteers in single and multiple doses up to 400 mg, and in 
three Phase  2a studies (Studies KLH1201, KLH1202 and KLH1203) in Japanese endometriosis patients 
at doses up to 200 mg daily for up to 12 weeks. An additional Phase 2b study (KLH1204) has been 
performed  in Japan . Its objective was to assess the efficacy and safety of  daily doses of linzagolix 25 
mg, 50 mg, 75 mg and 100 mg for up to 24 weeks in Japanese subjects with EAP . Overall, 4 55 subjects 
were  randomized . 
The PK and pharmacodynamics (PD)  of linzagolix have been further investigated in eight  Phase [ADDRESS_1057652] igating the use of estrogen/progestin ABT , potential drug -drug interactions, 
bioequivalence of forumulations and the effect of linzagolix on the QT interval.  
The efficacy and safety of linzagolix have been  investigated in US and European patients with moderate 
to severe EAP in a dose -ranging Phase 2b study at doses from 50 to 200 mg daily for up to 12 months 
(study 15 -OBE2109 -001, also known as Edelweiss ).  
The efficacy and safety of linzagolix in moderate to severe EAP are also being investigated in t wo 
ongoing  Phase 3 placebo -controlled  studies : 18-OBE2109 -002 (Edelweiss 2) and 18-OBE2109 -003 
(Edelweiss 3). A total of 450 subjects per study are planned to be enrolled in the [LOCATION_003], Canada and 
Europe.  Daily doses of 75 mg alone and 200 mg in combination with low dose ABT (E2 1 mg/  
norethisterone acetate (NETA ) 0.5 mg) are administered for up to 6 months . The study described herein 
is the extension of 18-OBE2109 -003 (Edelweiss 3)  study. The extension of 18-OBE2109 -002 
(Edelweiss 2) study is described in a separate protocol.  
In addition to the endometriosis indication, t wo placebo -controlled Phase 3 studies (16 -OBE2109 -008 
and 16 -OBE2109 -009) assessing the efficacy and safety of linzagolix in subjects with  heavy menstrual 
bleeding associated with uterine fibroids  are on going . Approximately  500 subjects per study are planned 
to be enrolled in the [LOCATION_003] and Europe. Daily doses of 100 and 200 mg of linzagolix are administered 
with or without ABT  (E2 1mg/NETA 0. 5mg) for up to 52 weeks.   
5.5.1 Pharmacokinetics /Pharmacodynamics  
Linzagolix was evaluated in a Phase 1 single/repeated -dose study (Study KLH1101) in which Japanese 
and Caucasian pre - and post -menopausal women received single doses of linzagolix from  12.5 to 700 
mg and repeated once daily doses of 100 to 400 mg once daily for 7 days under fed and fasted conditions. 
Linzagolix was safe and well -tolerated, showed linear PK, a half -life of about 15 –[ADDRESS_1057653] -menopausal wom en or between Japanese and Caucasian women. There 
was a dose -dependent suppression of E2, LH and follicle -stimulating hormone ( FSH). 
19-OBE2109 -[ADDRESS_1057654] 2020  Page 29 of 122 
 OBSEVA  CONFIDENTIAL  Study 17 -OBE2109 -001 evaluated the tolerability and PK of a single supra -therapeutic dose of 700 mg 
linzagolix , and effects of therapeutic and supratherapeutic doses of linzagolix on the QTc i nterval  (QT 
interval corrected for heart rate ). Subjects received a 200 mg dose of linzagolix (therapeutic target 
exposure), a 700 mg dose of linzagolix (supratherapeutic target exp osure), a 400 mg dose of 
moxifloxacin (positive control), and placebo with an appropriate washout. Linzagolix at [ADDRESS_1057655] asma and all 
plasma metabolites were present at less than 10% of the total drug related exposure. Similarly, 
unchanged linzagolix was also a major component in urine and feces. Linzagolix was eliminated in urine 
(52%) and, to a lesser extent, in feces (38% ). 
Study 16 -OBE2109 -011 assessed the PD and safety of linzagolix alone and combined with E2/ NETA 
ABT  on E2 levels and vaginal bleeding. In this single -center, open -label, randomized, parallel -group 
study, 76 healthy premenopausal women were randomized to linzagolix (100  mg), linzagolix/ E2/ 
NETA (100  mg/0.5  mg/0.1  mg), linzagolix/ E2/ NETA (100  mg/1  mg/0.5  mg), linzagolix (200  mg) or 
linzagolix/E2/NETA (200  mg/1  mg/0.5  mg) once daily for [ADDRESS_1057656] in subjects treated at 200 mg.  
A single -center, open -label, randomized, parallel -group study (study 17 -OBE2109 -008) in 32 healthy 
pre-menopausal women was performed to assess whether co -administration of ABT fo llowing 4 weeks 
of high -dose linzagolix administration alone would result in improved bleeding patterns compared to 
combined linzagolix/ABT administration. Subjects were randomized to once daily linzagolix 
(200 mg)/ABT for 10 weeks or linzagolix (200 mg) f or 4 weeks followed by [CONTACT_684086] 
(200 mg)/ABT for 6 weeks. Starting the administration of linzagolix and hormonal ABT together 
provided better bleeding control than delaying the ABT treatment start for 4 weeks.  
In a drug -drug interaction study  with women of child bearing potential (Study 16 -OBE2109 -005), 
linzagolix did not induce CYP3A4 and there was no clinically significant food effect . In another drug -
drug interaction study (Study 17 -OBE2109 -006) the OATP1B1/1B3 inhibitor rifampi[INVESTIGATOR_2513] (600  mg single 
dose) had no clinically relevant effects on the PK of linzagolix.  Studies [ADDRESS_1057657] of linzagolix on the PK of CYP2C8 and OAT3 substrates. Linzagolix 
had no clinically relevant effects on the PK of OAT3 sub strates and was shown to be a weak inhibitor 
of the CYP2C8 enzyme.  
A single -center, open -label, randomized, two -period cross -over study in 20 healthy pre -menopausal 
women (Study 17 -OBE2109 -004) aimed to demonstrate the bioequivalence of linzagolix formulation A 
(reference  formulation ), used in Phase 2b Edelweiss  study 15 -OBE2109 -001, and formulation B ( test 
formulation ) planned to be used in the current  Phase [ADDRESS_1057658] formulation was  found to be bioequivalent to the reference f ormulation for Cmax 
and area under the curves  (AUCs ) of linzagolix and KP017 (metabolite). A single administration of 
linzagolix formulations A and B to healthy female participants was safe and well tolerated.

 OBSEVA  CONFIDENTIAL  5.5.2 Efficacy  
The clinical efficacy of linzagolix has been investigated in  five Phase 2 studies . 
In a Phase 2 clinical study  (Study KLH1201)  conducted in Japan  in patients with endometriosis, 50 or 
200 mg linzagolix was orally administered once daily for 8 weeks . Linzagolix improved endometriosis 
symptoms and continuously suppressed E2 in a dose -dependent manner.  
In a Phase 2 clinical study  (Study KLH1202)  conducted in Japan  in patients with endometriosis, 50, 
100, or 200 mg linzagolix or placebo was orally administered once daily for 12 weeks. Linzagolix 
significantly reduced endometriosis pain symptoms compared with placebo.  
In a Phase 2 clinical study  (Study KLH1203)  condu cted in Japan  in patients with endometriosis, 75 or 
150 mg linzagolix was orally administered once daily for 8 weeks. Linzagolix improved endometriosis 
symptoms and continuously suppressed E2 in a dose -dependent manner.  
A Phase 2b study (KLH1204) conducted  in Japan assessed the efficacy and safety of once daily doses 
of linzagolix 25 mg, 50 mg, 75 mg and 100 mg for up to 24 weeks in subjects with EAP . There was a 
dose-dependent improvement of EAP , with significant improvement compared to placebo at the 75 a nd 
100 mg doses.  
In a Phase 2b study (Study 15 -OBE2109 -001, also known as Edelweiss ) conducted in US and Europe 
in patients with endometriosis, doses of 50, 75, 100, [ADDRESS_1057660] improvements on all efficacy endpoints were reported at dose levels of 
75 mg and above during the main study (75 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg), as well as treatment extension (75 
mg, 100 mg).  
The 75 mg group demonstrated the ability for long -term treatment (52 weeks of continuous dosing with 
linzagolix) of a dose combining significant treatment benefit with a good safety profile and without the 
need for hormonal ABT ; the 200/100 mg group is con sidered as a benchmark group to characterize 
efficacy and safety of a high -dose linzagolix regimen following 52 weeks of continuous dosing.   
5.5.3 Safety  
More than 1,500 subjects were exposed to a range of  doses (25, 50, 75, 100, 200, 400 mg) of linzagolix 
from  [ADDRESS_1057661] on total plasma linzag olix exposure. In women with severe 
hepatic impairment (Child -Pugh C), [ADDRESS_1057662] on total plasma linz agolix exposure. In women with severe 
renal impairment (eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2) or end -stage renal disease, approximately [ADDRESS_1057663] 2020  Page 31 of 122 
 OBSEVA  CONFIDENTIAL  unbound mean exposures were recorded. In renal impaired subjects , a single dose of 200 mg was  well 
tolerated . 
The expected sid e effects of l inzagolix are disturbances of the  menstrual cycle and hypoestrogenic 
adverse events (AEs) ( e.g., metrorrhagia and hot fl ush).  
In multiple -dose studies, a dose -dependent occurrence of hot flush was observed (14.63%, 27.27%, 
27.8%, 30% and 40.7% at 50 mg, 75 mg, 100 mg, 150 mg and 200 mg linzagolix, respectively). In the 
Phase 2b Edelweiss  trial (15-OBE2109 -001), a moderate proport ion of patients reported a dose -
dependent increase in hot flush es (at week 12, placebo: 10.9% reporting at least one hot flush; 75mg: 
18.4%; 200 mg: 42.1% - at week 24, 75 mg: 19.0%; 200 mg: 45.6%).  
Anticipated AEs are events that were not necessarily obs erved with linzagolix but can be anticipated 
based on the drug’s pharmacological action and/or cl ass effects, such as: i ncrease in liver function test 
(LFT) parameters, headache, dizziness, nausea, hyperhidrosis, blood cholesterol increased, low density 
lipoprotein increased and BMD loss.  
In few subjects, an increase in transaminase values exceeding 3 >ULN (Upper Limit of Normal) was 
observed under treatment . Most often the increase in transaminase values was reversible and decreased 
spontaneously back to normal levels under treatment. Increase s in transaminase values were not 
associated with increased bilirubin values.  
A borderline effect of linzagolix on the QT c interval was identified with prolongations exceeding the 
threshold of concern by [CONTACT_684087] [ADDRESS_1057664] majority of related AEs were reported as being of “mild” or “moderate” intensity;  very few 
related events were reported as being of “severe” intensity.  
In the Phase 2b Edelweiss  trial (15-OBE2109 -001), changes from baseline to week 24 in BMD w ere 
measured by [CONTACT_751]-energy X -ray absorptiometry  (DXA ) scan, using central reading. Partial E2  
suppression achieved with linzagolix 75  mg was associated with a mean percent change from baseline 
in spi[INVESTIGATOR_9210] (the site of greatest  bone loss) of ‐0.8% (95% CI ‐1.57, ‐0.03) after 6 months of treatment, 
while achieving improvement in symptoms  in the majority of patients. As expected, full E2 suppression 
with linzagolix 200  mg lowers BMD by [CONTACT_726] 2.5%  after 6 months of treatment , which indicate s 
the need for hormonal  ABT for use beyond 6 months . 
In th e Phase 2b Edelweiss  trial (15-OBE2109 -001), following the main study, subjects willing to 
continue treatment were entered into an extension study for an additional [ADDRESS_1057665] -treatment follow -up. Subjects received either 50 mg, 75 mg, or 100 mg 
of linzagolix, once daily in accordance with the treatment received in Part B, except for those subjects 
who had been randomized to 200 mg dose, w hich was reduced during the extension phase to 100 mg 
daily. A Es were collected throughout  the study. B MD of femoral neck, total hip, and lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_770594] 52.  
Of the 253 subjects who completed the 24 weeks of treatment in the main  study, 176 subjects received 
treatmen t in the extension . A summary of the safety findings is below:  
19-OBE2109 -[ADDRESS_1057666] 2020  Page 32 of 122 
 OBSEVA  CONFIDENTIAL  At Week 52, BMD loss was seen in the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_770595], except for the 50 mg group. 
Mean BMD loss in the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_770596] 1.5% in the 75 mg fixed dose  (FD)  and 100 mg groups, 
with mean percent decreases (and lower 95% CI) from baseline of -1.139% ( -2.21%), and -1.399% ( -
3.35%), respectively. The greatest reductions were observed in the 75 mg titrated dose  (TD) , 
placebo /100 mg, and 20 0/100 mg grou ps with mean percent decreases (and lower 95% CI) from baseline 
of -2.646% ( -4.46%), -2.503% ( -4.04%), and -2.188% ( -3.59%), respectively.  
At Week 52, BMD loss was detected in the femoral neck in all treatment groups, except for the 75 mg 
FD g roup. Mean BMD loss was similar in the 50 mg,75 mg TD, and 100 mg groups, with mean percent 
decreases (and lower 95% CI) from baseline of -0.992% ( - 1.84%), -0.843% ( -2.58%), and -1.102% ( -
3.10%), respectively. The greatest reduction was observed in the 20 0/100 mg group with a mean percent 
decrease (and lower 95% CI) from baseline of -2.592% ( -4.49%).  
At Week 52, BMD loss was detected in the total hip in all treatment groups. Mean BMD loss in the total 
hip was below 1% in the placebo/100 mg, 50 mg,75 mg FD,  and 100 mg groups, with mean percent 
decreases (and lower 95% CI) from baseline of -0.807% ( - 1.82%), -0.411% ( -1.22%), -0.297% ( -
1.36%), and -0.597% ( -1.61%), respectively. The greatest reductions were observed in the 200/100 mg 
and 75 mg TD groups with mean percent decreases (and lower 95% CI) from baseline of -2.025% ( -
3.58%) and - 1.363% ( -3.23%), respectively.  
For the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], the site most sensitive to BMD loss, an increase in the proportion of subjects >3% 
BMD loss  was reported in a dose -dependent manner across linzagolix groups at Week 52: 4.8%, 18.2%, 
23.1% and 50% for the 50 mg, 75 mg FD, 100 mg, and 200/[ADDRESS_1057667] mean BMD loss was in the 200/100 mg group for the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]: -2.887% 
(-4.07%). At Week 52, after receiving 28 weeks of 100 mg linzagolix, there appeared to be no additional 
BMD loss: mean percent change from baseline of - 2.188% ( -3.59%). This observation may be due to 
increased E2 levels observed after the dose was lowe red from 200 mg to 100 mg at Week 24. Of note, 
a similar proportion of subjects had a decrease >3% in the 200/100 mg group at Week 24 (51.9%) and 
Week 52 (50.0%).  
Median Z scores, interquartile ranges and total ranges for femoral neck, total hip and lumbar  spi[INVESTIGATOR_770597], Week 24 and Week 52 did not change importantly over time: medians remained within the 
range of -0.20 to 0.30, 0 to 0.40, and -0.25 to 0.35 in all treatment groups for the femoral neck, total hip 
and lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], respectively. Median ab solute change from baseline to Week 52 ranged from -0.10 to 
0.00, -0.10 to 0.00 and -0.20 to -0.10, respectively.  
Over the 52 -week treatment period, 154/176 (87.5%) of subjects reported  treatment emergent adverse 
events  (TEAEs ). The incidence of TEAEs was not dose -dependent across treatment groups, ranging 
from 81.8% in the 100 mg group to 93.3% in the 200/100 mg group. The majority of the TEAEs 
(616/846; 72.8%) were reported during the first [ADDRESS_1057668] commonly reported TEAEs were head ache (32.4%) and hot flush (28.4%). The majority of 
these events occurred during the first 24 weeks of treatment. Headaches were reported with a similar 
frequency across treatment groups, ranging from 22.2% in the 75 mg FD group to 44.8% in the 
placebo/100  mg group, with no apparent dose relationship. Conversely, the incidence of hot flushes was 
dose-dependent and increased with increasing exposure to linzagolix: 16.7% (50 mg), 20.7% (75 mg 
FD), 22.2% (75 mg TD), 24.1% (placebo/100 mg), 27.3% (100 mg), and 60.0% (200/100 mg). Of note, 
there was no worsening in the incidence of hot flushes during the treatment extension; only 2/[ADDRESS_1057669] 2020  Page 33 of 122 
 OBSEVA  CONFIDENTIAL  Ten serious AEs (SAEs) were reported in nine subjects. None of the SAEs were considered as related  
to study treatment. The SAEs of ruptured ectopic pregnancy (50 mg), pelvic pain (50 mg), pneumonia 
(75 mg TD), and anxiety disorder (200/100 mg) led to subject withdrawal from treatment during the 
extension phase of the study.  
During treatment extension, 12 subjects (6.8%) reported 17 TEAEs leading to treatment withdrawal. In 
the 200/[ADDRESS_1057670] and/or ALT values >2×ULN during the treatment extension.  
Overall, there were no clinically meaningful changes from baseline in laboratory parameters, vital signs , 
physical examination, or lipid measurements including HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and 
triglycerides in any group.  
Gynecological examinations showed a small number of abnormal clinically significant  results, but with 
a higher frequency noted for ute rus and ovaries. At Week  24, reductions from baseline in endometrial 
thickness and uterus volume were more notable at the higher doses of linzagolix (100  mg and 200  mg) 
compared to the lower doses. This pattern was not observed at Week 52. Endometrial biop sy did not 
raise any safety concern.  
Overalll, the safety findings at the end of 52 weeks of treatment revealed no new safety issues.  Patterns 
of BMD loss were similar to the main study.   
5.6 RATIONALE FOR THE CURRENT STUDY  
Endometriosis is a chronic disease requiring long -term continuous treatment . The results of the Phase 
2b, Edelweiss study  (study 15 -OBE2109 -001) supported the sustained efficacy and overall safety of 12 -
month treatment with linzagolix in symptomatic endometriosis ( see sections 5.5.2  and 5.5.3 ). 
In the present study , we will collect long -term (up to 12 months) data on the safety and efficacy of 
linzagolix in subjects with EAP  who have completed 6  month s of treatment in study 18 -OBE2109 -003 
(Edelweiss 3).  
5.7 SUMMARY OF OVERALL R ISKS AND BENEFITS  
Linzagolix  efficacy compared to placebo was demonstrated at daily doses of 75–[ADDRESS_1057671] commonly reported AEs in the Phase 2 studies 
were headache  and hot flush  which are related to the biological activity of linzagolix .  
Eleven p regnancies were in the Phase 2 studies . No fetal or newborn abnormalities  were reported  in any 
of the pregnancies . 
There were no clinically relevant findings in laboratory measurements, vital signs or electrocardiogram 
(ECG ) recordings. The administration of linzagolix  results in infrequent, transient, moderate and no n- 
dose-related increases in transaminase levels whi ch were not associated with changes  in bilirubin levels.  
A borderline increase in QTc interval was observed in healthy volunteers which was not considered 
clinically significant. Nevertheless, all subjects in th e current  study will be monitored monthly wit h

6 OBJECTIVES  
6.1 EFFICACY OBJECTIVES  
6.1.1 Primary  
The primary objective of this extension s tudy is to assess  the maintenance of efficacy of linzagolix 
administered orally once daily  for up to an additional 6 months (for up to 12  months  of treatment in 
total)  in women who have already completed 6 months of linzagolix treatment  at a dose of 75 mg alone 
or 200 mg in combination with ABT ( E2 1 mg  / NETA  0.5 mg) in the management of moderate to 
severe EAP in women with surgically confirmed endometriosis. The two co-primary efficacy endpoints 
will be clinically meaningful reduction over the last 28 days of randomized treatment up to the Month 
12 visit , along  with a stable or decreased use of analgesics for EAP  for 1) dysmenorrhea ( DYS ) and for 
2) non menstrual pelvic pain (NMPP ).

[CONTACT_737].  
Any deviations from the recommended storage conditions at the site should be immediately reported to 
the Sponsor  (or delegate), and the IMP should not be used until authori zation has been given by [CONTACT_429]  (or delegate).  
11.5 IMP  ACCOUNTABILITY  
The Investigator is responsible for ensuring IMP accountability, including reconciliation and 
maintenance of drug records.  
 Upon receipt of the IMP, the Investigator (or  delegate ) will c heck for accurate delivery and 
acknowledge receipt  in IWRS . A copy of acknowledgement of receipt will be retained in the 
investigator file. In case the IMP received is damaged upon delivery  (including temperature 
excursion) , this should be immediately reported to the Sponsor (or delegate), and the IMP 
should not be used until authori zation has been given by [CONTACT_1034] (or delegate).  
 The dispensing of the IMP will be carefully recorded on the appropriate drug account ability 
form  provided by [CONTACT_1034]  (or delegate)  and in eCRF, and an accurate accounting will be 
availabl e for verification by [CONTACT_304732].  
 IMP accountability records will include:  
o Confirmation of IMP delivery to the trial site  
o The inventory at the  site of IMP delivered  
o The use of each dose by [CONTACT_6992]  (accountability to be done at each visit)  
o Dates, quantities, batch numbers  and kit number s assigned to the subject . 
o The return to the Sponsor  (or delegate) or alternative disposition of u sed and u nused 
IMP 
 The Investigator should maintain records that adequately document:  
o The subject s were provided with the doses specified by [CONTACT_760]/amendment(s) . 
o All IMP provided were fully reconciled . 
19-OBE2109 -[ADDRESS_1057753] . 
The Study  monitor will check  on an ongoing basis the IMP accountabili ty form  and verify all IMP 
dispensations and  returns (both unused and used treatments ) during the entire study period and prior to 
making arrange ments for their return to the Sponsor  (or delegate)  or authori zing their destruction by [CONTACT_770626] . 
11.6 ASSIGNMENT TO TREATMENT GROUPS

75 mg alone (with ABT placebo) or linzagolix 200 mg with ABT, as per the main study random ization 
schedule.  
Subjects who received active treatment will continue with the same treatment  (linzagolix 75 mg alone 
or linzagolix 200 mg with ABT) . 
In order to maintain the blind, the site will not be required to perform any randomization activities. The 
kits will be automatically allocated in the IWRS  to the corresponding patients upon confirmation of their 
eligibility.

11.10  TREATMENT OF OVERDOS E AND MISUSE  
An overdose is defined as any dose (i.e. quantity of drug given per administration or per day) above the 
maximum  dosage defin ed in the protocol  (200 mg per day) .  
Misuse is  the term used if more precise information is not available and additional information is needed 
to determine if there was a “medication error”, “drug abuse” or “overdose”.  
Any details of overdose  or misuse must be recorded in the eCRF .  
Any case of overdose or misuse associated with an AE or a SAE must be reported  as per the instructions 
detailed in Section s 12.2.3  for AEs or 12.3.2  for SAEs . 
The effects of an overdose of linzagolix  are unknown , but repeated once  daily dosing at up to 700 mg 
linzagolix was safe and well -tolerated by [CONTACT_770627] , and doses up to 200 mg 
daily for 3 months were safe in endometriosis subjects  (see Section 5.5.3 ). 
11.[ADDRESS_1057756] UDY  
A limited quantity (as per Investigator’s judgement) of standard doses of permitted analges ics will be 
provided /prescribed  to the subject as rescue medication for EAP  (see Section 10.6.1 ). These  will be

19-OBE2109 -[ADDRESS_1057758] (see 
section 12.2.1 ). 
The safety profile of linzagolix  will be assessed through the recording, reporting and analys is of baseline 
medical conditions, AEs, physical examination findin gs, ECGs, vital signs , laboratory tests , BMD  
assessments . 
The reporting  period for AEs is described in section 12.5. 
 
12.1 ADVERSE EVENTS  
12.1.1  Definitions  
Adverse Event : 
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any  untoward medical occurrence in a clinical trial subject 
administered a n investigational  medicinal product (IMP) and which does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with this treatment. It can therefore be any unfavourable sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an IMP, whether or not 
considered related to the IMP. 
Any event  occurring after signature [CONTACT_770636], as appropriate.  
Severity : 
The severity of AEs must be assessed by [CONTACT_304735]. The 
term “severity” is used to describe the intensity of a specific event. This has to be distinguished from 
the term “serious”.  
Mild:  The subject is aware of the event or symptom, but the event or symptom is 
easily tolerated (e.g. no reductio n in daily activities is required).  
Moderate:  The subject experiences sufficient discomfort to interfere with or reduce her 
usual level of activity.  
Severe:  
 Significant impairment of functioning: the subject is unable to carry out usual 
activities and/o r the subject’s life is at risk from the event.  
Causality assessment : 
The causality assessment of an AE to the linzagolix and/or ABT will be rated as follows by [CONTACT_3786]:  
Not related:  There is no reasonable possibility of causal relationship between an AE and IMP.  

19-OBE2109 -[ADDRESS_1057759] 2020  Page 71 of 122 
 OBSEVA  CONFIDENTIAL  Related:  There is at least a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship between an AE and 
an IMP. This means that there are facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal 
relationship.  
Unexpected Adverse Event : 
Any AE which  is not consistent in specificity or severity with the current Investigator’s Brochure  
(section 6. 7.1), including all amendments, is considered unexpected.  
 
Outcome : 
Outcome describes the status of the AE. The Investigator will provide information regardin g the subject 
outcome of each AE, and the options include:  
Fatal  Termination of life as a result of an AE . 
Not recovered/not resolved  Subject has not recuperated or the AE has not improved . 
Recovering/resolving  Subject is recuperating or the AE is improving . 
Recovered/resolved  Subject has recuperated or the AE has resolved . 
Recovered with sequelae/resolved 
with sequelae  AE has resolved, but the subject has symptoms or pathology . 
Unknown  Unknown, not observed, not recorded, or refused . 
Action taken regarding study drug : 
The Investigator will provide the action taken regarding study drug in response to each AE, and the 
options include:  
Dose not changed  No change in the administration of study drug . 
Drug (study drug) interrupted  Study drug is being temporarily interrupted due to AE . 
Drug (study drug) withdrawn  Decision was made to withdraw the study drug due to AE . 
Unknown  Unknown, not observed  or not recorded . 
Not applicable  AE started before dosing or after dosing finalized.  
19-OBE2109 -[ADDRESS_1057760] 2020  Page 72 of 122 
 OBSEVA  CONFIDENTIAL  12.1.2  Abnormal laboratory findings and other objective measurements  
Abnormal laboratory findings and other objective measurements (e.g. vital signs ) must be reported as 
an AE only if assessed by [CONTACT_5256] “clinically significant ” e.g. meet ing at least one of the 
following conditions:  
1. The abnormality suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity AND this abnormality was not present 
at the main study screening visit or is assessed as having evolved since th is visit.  
2. The abnormality is a Serious Adver se Event . 
3. The abnormality results in discontinuation of the IMP. 
4. The abnormality requires medical intervention or concomitant therapy . 
The Investigator  must initial and date each laboratory report /eCRF  page and note directly on the 
report /eCRF  page  whether  or not each out -of-range laboratory result is clinically significant.  The 
outcome of this assessment will be reported using an AE or SAE form, as appropriate.  
When reporting an abnormal finding for laboratory parameters or other objective measurements  on the 
AE page of the eCRF , a clinical diagnosis should be recorded rather than the abnormal value itself, if 
available (for example, “anaemia” rather than “decreased red blood cell count”) . 
For all of these AEs, whether or not related to the treatment, the laboratory test(s) will be followed -up 
as appropriate.  
12.1.3  Baseline Medical Conditions  
Medical conditions present at the Screening  visit(s) in the main study , including results of the study 
screening assessments,  are defined as Baseline Medical Conditions. These medical conditions should 
have been adequately documented on the “medical history page of the eCRF ”. Baseline Medical 
Conditions that worsen in severity or frequency during the study should be recorded and  reported as 
AEs. 
12.1.[ADDRESS_1057761] and/or through questioning o f the subject.  
To elicit AEs, questioning at each study visit should begin with simple non -leading questions. For 
example:  
 How have you felt since your last visit?  
 Have you had any health problems since you were here last ?  
If a subject is seen by a physician not involved with the study in relation to an AE, the Investigator  
should make every effort to contact [CONTACT_684118] a timely manner in order to obtain all 
information necessary for the appropriate reporti ng of the event.  
12.2.2  Recording of Adverse Events in the eCRF  
As the quality and precision of acquired AE data are critical, Investigator s should use the AE definitions 
provided in the above sections and should follow  this guideline when completing the AE pages of the 
eCRF : 
 Whenever possible, recogni zed medical terms should be used to describe AEs rather than 
colloquialisms (for example, ‘influenza’ rather than ‘flu’), and abbreviations should be avoided  
in provided AE term . 
 AEs should be described using a specific clinical diagnosis, if this is available, rather than a list 
of component signs or symptoms (for example, ‘congestive heart failure’ rather tha n ‘dyspnoea, 
rales and cyanosis ’).  
 However, signs and symptoms that a re not linked (as "co -manifestations”) to an identified 
disease or syndrome, or for which an overall diagnosis is not available, should be reported as 
individual AEs  in separate eCRF  AE page(s) .  
 Provisional diagnosis (e.g. “suspected Myocardial Infarction ”) are acceptable but should be 
followed up to a definite diagnosis , if finally available.  
 AEs occurring secondary to other events (e.g. sequelae or complications) should be identified 
by [CONTACT_86187]. A primary AE, if clearly identifiable, generally represents the most 
accurate clinical term to record in the eCRF . The Investigator  should be i nvited to provide 
his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_263904].  
12.2.[ADDRESS_1057762] 2020  Page 74 of 122 
 OBSEVA  CONFIDENTIAL  It is important that each AE report includes a description of the event, whether it is considered serious 
(and if so the criterion satisfied), its duration (onset and resolution dates), its severity, its relationship to 
the IMP(s) , any other p otential caus ality factors, any  treatment given or other action taken (including 
dose modification or discontinuation of the IMP) and its outcome.  
12.3 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
12.3.1  Definitions  
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is defined as a ny untoward medical occurrence or effect that at any 
dose:  
 
 results in death , 
i.e. the AE causes or contributes to the death.  
 is life -threatening , 
i.e. the AE places the subject at immediate risk of death; it does not refer to AE which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe . 
 requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] , 
i.e. the AE requires at least an overnight admission or prolongs a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_304691]. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_304692], for social 
reasons, for any elective surgery (i.e. plastic surgery) or for normal disease management 
(including treatment adjustment) are NOT to be considered as SAE s according to this criterion . 
 results in persistent or significant disability / incap acity , 
i.e. the AE resulted in a substantial disruption of the subject’s ability to conduct normal 
activities.  
 is a congenital anomaly / birth defect , 
i.e. an adverse outcome in a child or fetus  of a subject exposed to the IMP before conception or 
during pregnancy.  
 is an important medical event , i.e. is medically significant  ; 
Medical and scien tific judgment should be exerciz ed in deciding whether an AE is serious in 
other situation. Important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result 
in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_770607]. 
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emerg ency room, or at home for allergic 
broncho spasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_18543], or 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
19-OBE2109 -[ADDRESS_1057763] notify  VOISIN CONSULTING  (acting on behalf of ObsEva

VOISIN CONSULTING  will notify ObsEva Pharmacovigilance within one working day  after the 
receipt of the SAE report or follow -up information, using the same reporting forms.  
The SAE follow -up observation period , for the concerned subjects , will be jointly decided by [CONTACT_304736] -Investigator s (in case of Investigator ’s absence) and the Sponsor .  
In addition, the Investigator  must respond to any request for follow -up information or questions 
regarding the SAE the Sponsor  may have , within  one working day for urgent queries or five working 
days for normal queries . SAE will be followed until the Inves tigator  and ObsEva agree that the event is 
satisfactor ily documented and resolved /stabilized . 
For any new SAE, the following minimum information is required as initial notification:  
 Clear identification of the Investigator /Reporter with full contact [CONTACT_304737] , 
 Subject identification details (study number, site number, subject’s unique study identification 
number and date of birth ), 
 IMP(s) administration details (dose and dates) , 
 Diagnosis of the event (or a brief description of signs/ symptoms/clinical course if the diagnosis 
is not available) and the date of onset,  
 Seriousness criteria  (see Section 12.3.1 ), 
 Causal r elationship (Investigator ’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]) of the event with the IMP(s) or with the trial 
procedure (e.g. the causality according to the Investigator  during screening ).

BOARDS /INDEPENDENT ETHICS COMMITTEES  AND  
REGULATORY AUTHORITI ES 
The Investigator  must comply with any applicable requirements related to the reporting of SAEs 
involving the study  subjects to the Institutional Review Board (IRB) /Independ ent Ethics Committee 
(IEC) that approved the study.  
ObsEva will comply with the applicable regulatory requirements related to the expedited reporting  of 
suspected unexpected  serious adverse reactions  (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) to the regulatory authorities  (e.g. Health 
Authority, Central IRB/IEC). The Sponsor  will be responsible, through their US Agent, for notifying 
the FDA of any S[LOCATION_003]R , and the Sponsor  or designee is responsible for notifying the Central IRB/IEC. 
In regions/countries other than the US, reporting of events to local authorities will be performed by [CONTACT_3786] /Sponsor  or designee and in accordance with local procedures/regulations.  
In accordance with ICH GCP guidelines, the Sponsor  will inform  the Investigator  of “findings that could 
affect adversely the safety of subjects, impact the conduct of the trial or alter the IRB/IEC’s 
approval/favourable opi[INVESTIGATOR_150831]” . In particular and in line with respect ive regulations , 
the Sponsor  will inform the Investigator  of AEs that are both serious and unexpected (i.e. as per the  
linzagolix  Investigator Brochure , and SmPC for the ABT ) and are considered by [CONTACT_770629] , to have a reasonably possibility of causal relationship between  the administered IMP and the 
AE (i.e. S[LOCATION_003]R) . The Investigator  will keep copi[INVESTIGATOR_304696] ’s file. 
National regulations with regards to safety reports notifications to Investigator s will be taken into 
account.  
Unless clearly defined otherwise by [CONTACT_108103] -specific regulations, and duly documented, the 
responsible Investigator  will promptly notify the concerned IRB/IEC of any safety reports provided by

Initial reporting of pregnancies : 
Subjects who become pregnant during the study Treatment Period  will be immediately withdrawn from 
the IMP treatment.  
The Investigator  must notify the Sponsor  in an expedited manner (same as SAE reporting) of any 
pregnancy occurring during the above -mentioned period, by [CONTACT_304739]-part I . 
This form should be sent to ObsEva’s Representative for Pharmacovigilance as per the same procedures 
and timelines described for SAE Urgent Reporting  in section 12.3.2 . This form should be accompanied, 
as needed, by [CONTACT_304740][INVESTIGATOR_304698], Previous an d Concomitant Therapy and the Exit 
Form.  
 
Follow -up of pregnancies:  
The Investigator  must actively follow -up, document and report to ObsEva’s Representative for 
Pharmacovigilance the progress by [CONTACT_248879]-monthly updates up to the final outcome of the pregnancy  
using the Pregnancy Surveillance Form – Part II : (Course of Pregnancy; PSF -part II). If the subject 
can no longer be reached (lost to follow -up), documentation of the non -response/contact [CONTACT_304741] a letter (certified with return receipt) a re required.  
Pregnancy outcomes are not recorded in the eCRF unless considered AEs.  
Pregnancy outcomes  must be reported to ObsEva ’s Representative for Pharmacovigilance by

part III). Timelines vary according to the nature of the pregnancy outcome:  
- For normal outcomes, ObsEva’s Representative for Pharmacovigilance should be notified within 
45 days of birth/delivery.  
- For abnormal outcomes, the fully completed form must be sent to ObsEva’s Representative for 
Pharmacovigilance according to the same procedures and timelines described for expedited AE 
reporting in section 12.3.2  (within 24 hours of awareness of this outcome).  An SAE Report form 
should  be completed  in addition to the PSF -part III if  the subject sustains  an event meeting 
seriousness criterion  (e.g. a bnormality for the pregnancy (spontaneous abortion, stillbirth) or 
abnormality for the birth itself (e.g. prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_684060]) ). In case of congenital malformation or  birth defect  of the child , a SAE Repor t 
form for the child should be complete d in addition to the PSF -part III (Subject identifier = Subject 
ID – 1 for a singleton neonate) . 

19-OBE2109 -[ADDRESS_1057767] OF HYPOTHESES  
No formal hypothesis tests are planned for this extension study. Data wi ll be summari zed by [CONTACT_770612] .   
13.2 SAMPLE SIZE  
With 150 subjects per each of the three treatment groups in the main study (450 subjects in total), the 
power was great er than 95% to reject the null hypothesis for both co -primary endpoints and 85% to 
reject all the null hypothesis for the ranked secondary endpoints. All subjects who have completed the 
full 6 -month Treatment Period  in the main study and who meet the inclusi on criteria will be offered to 
enter the extension study. It is estimated that  up to  288 subjects will enter the extension study , assuming 
that 80% of the patients randomized in the main study will complete the study  (namely 360 subjects) 
and that up to 80 % thereof will enter the extension study . 
13.3 RANDOMI ZATION  
Subjects who previously received placebo will be random ized in a 1:1 ratio  to either linzagolix 75 mg 
alone (with ABT placebo) or linzagolix 200 mg with ABT), as per the main study randomization 
schedule.  Subjects will be randomized into permutated blocks of a pre -determined length . 
Subjects who received active treatment will continue with the same treatment  (linzagolix 75 mg alone 
or linzagolix 200 mg with ABT) . 
In order to maintain the blind, th e site will not be required to perform any randomization activities. The 
kits will be automatically allocated to the corresponding patients in the IWRS  upon confirmation of their 
eligibility.  
13.4 ANALYSIS SETS  
The following data sets will be used for the statistical analysis : 
1. Treatment Extension  Analysis Set : All subjects from the main study who entered the extension 
study and received at least one dose of study drug with the exception of subjects whose Month 6 
assessments subsequently met any of the disco ntinuation criteria listed in section [IP_ADDRESS] . These 
subjects will be withdrawn from study treatment and will enter the Follow -Up Period . Subjects will 
be analyzed according to randomized treatment.  
 
2. Follow -up Extension Analysis Set : All subjects from the main study who completed the [ADDRESS_1057768] 2020  Page 79 of 122 
 OBSEVA  CONFIDENTIAL  3. Extension Safety Analysis Set : All subjects randomized into the extension study who received at 
least one dose of study drug irrespective of the treatment received. Subjects will be analyzed 
according to treatment received.  
 
4. Exten sion Pharmacokinetic (PK) Set: all subjects who were randomized and received active study 
medication in the main study , had no major protocol deviations impacting PK throughout the main 
study or extension  and with available PK data . 
 
5.  Extension Pharmacodynamic (PD) Set:  all subjects who were randomized and received active 
study medication in the main study , had no major protocol deviations impacting PD throughout the 
main study or extension  and with available PD data.  
 
Individual data points may also be excluded from the analysis sets. Rules for  such exclusions will be 
described in the statistical analysis plan (SAP) . 
13.5 DATA ANALYSIS  
The primary objective of this extension study is to assess the maintenance of efficacy of linzagolix 
administered orally once daily for up to an additional 6 months (for up to 12 months of treatment in 
total)  in the subset of subjects who are treated with linzagolix up to the time point of interest . As such, 
the focus will be on subjects who received active treatment in the main study. The assessment of subjects 
who switched from placebo in the main study to active treatment in the extension study will be 
conducted as a secondary objective.  
Subjects will be analyzed according to actual treatment received. The following  four treatment groups 
will be analyzed: linzagolix 75 mg and linzagolix 200 mg with ABT fixed dose groups, linzagolix 75 
mg and linzagolix 200 mg with ABT after 6 months p lacebo treatment . Only subjects with assessments 
at both baseline and the given time  points will be included in the summaries.  Baseline values are the 
same as in the main study (18 -OBE2109 -003 - Edelweiss 3) , i.e. data collected prior to the treatment 
administration  in the main study.  
More details of the proposed statisical analyses will be described in the SAP, which will be written 
following finalization of the protocol and prior to database lock.  
13.5.[ADDRESS_1057769] ics for each treatment group , 
for each time point, including summaries of change from baseline when applicable.  
13.5.3  Safety  Analysis  
Summaries will be performed using the Extension Safety Analysis Set and the Follow -up Extension 
Analysis Set.  
Data from both the main study and the extensi on study will be summari zed. 
13.5.4  Pharmacokinetic analysis methodology  
Descriptive statistics of plasma concentrations will include mean (arithmetic and geometric) and 
standard deviation, median, 1st and 3rd quartiles, minimum, maximum, coefficient of variation  (CV%) 
and number of observations. Concentrations below the limit of quantification (LOQ) will be assigned a 
value of zero. Explorative analyses of correlations between plasma concentrations and intrinsic PK 
factors such as e.g. body weight/BMI, race, age may be performed, as appropriate, and will be reported 
separately.  
PK analyses will be based on the Extension PK Set .

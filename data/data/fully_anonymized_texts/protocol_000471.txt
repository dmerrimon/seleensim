2.1       LABC: A  Disease of the Under served
The term  ―locally advanced breast cancer‖ (LABC) comm only includ es tumors whose 
maximum di amete r is 5 cm (T3) or large r, or whic h pre sent with involvem ent of the chest 
wall or skin. Surprisi ngly, the simultaneous presence of clinically de tectable distant 
meta stase s is relativel y infrequent (~8%), a peculiar finding since in 73% of these  large 
tumors it is poss ible to d ocument she dding of tumor ce lls into the blood 1.
While LABC has bec ome a rare clinical pre sentation of breast cancer in the general 
population  as  a  result  of  improve d  early  de tection  by  [CONTACT_722504],  it 
remains relatively comm on among minorit y wom en of low socioeconomi c status  2. For 
instance, in a consec utive series of [ADDRESS_986760] for L ABC.
NYU 06-209
page   82.2       LABC: a  Wor ldwid e Problem
The n eed to unde rstand LABC is especially compelling in populations  and countrie s with 
limited resource s, where breast cancer incide nce is relatively low, but morta lity is 
compara bly high 6. In these settings access to appropriate cancer care is characteristically 
limited or often plainl y none xistent. In contrast to econom ically developed  nations, whe re 
on average fewe r than 20% of wome n present with breast cancer at advanced stages 7, 
LABC and met astatic disea se are the most comm on st ages at pre sentation in 50% or mo re 
wome n in Latin Ame rica, Asia a nd Africa . Althoug h pre cise data are scarce, reports from 
areas as diverse as South Ame rica (Arge ntina, Brazil, Peru) 8, India [ADDRESS_986761] clinical experience reporte d by [CONTACT_722505] s. In 1996, in the city of Trivandrum, in the State of Kerala, south India, 
stage III LABC accounte d for over 40% of new cases of breast cancer, and stage IV for 
an additional 12.8% 9. In South Africa , medic al records of various large academic 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_722492]  1980s and 1990s offer a pi[INVESTIGATOR_722493], with stages III and IV being the stages at presentation for 77.7% of black 
patients, as c ompar ed to 30.7% a mong non-bla cks 10.
The exp erience of economi cally developed countrie s, like the U.S., show that 
these incid ences can be modi fied resulting in markedly reduce d breast cancer mortality. 
In fac t, while  U.S. brea st cancer morta lity remained consta nt from the 1930s to the late
1980s, b eginning in the early 1990s it has started decreasing by 1-2% annua lly, a 
phenomenon  that  continues  11.  Althoug h  the  causes  remain  unc lear,  it  is  strong ly 
suspec ted that it is the result of an effective combi nation of timely early detection and 
subst antial improve ments in therapy. Further  gains in terms of reduced morta lity in the 
U.S. and worldwide  could be achieved with a deeper unde rstanding of LABC—a multi- 
dimensiona l  disea se  that  requires  a  multi-dim ensiona l  approac h  for  it s  stu dy  a nd
unde rst anding. These components include be havioral, cultural, epi[INVESTIGATOR_722494], genetic, 
immuno logica l, molecular and possi bly ethnic aspects, whic h need to be investig ated 
concurrently, as they all have the potential to contribute to our unde rstanding. Thus, 
reaching out to populations comprisi ng a broa d range of ethnic, social, economi c and 
health care characteristics—a global perspec tive for a global disease—is the most 
effective means for inves tigating, unde rstanding and eventuall y impacting on L ABC.

mana gement of all invasive bre ast cancers.
2.5       P re-o perative   Concur rent   Che mother apy   and   Radi ation:   P reliminary
Experience
Over   the  past  decade  we  ha ve  investiga ted  the  combi nation  of  up-front  concurrent 
chemo-radiation  as a pre -operative tr eatment, the extent of pa thologica l response of the 
primary tum or then being used as a principa l endpoint to measure tumor resistance to the 
tested chemo-radiation regimen. Radiation had traditional ly pla yed a role in the 
mana gement of LABC since loca l control is also an importa nt endpoint in this disease. 
Howe ver, it is usuall y added after surge ry 13, 15-18. We have selected concurrent chemo- 
radiation based on the promi sing re sults witnes sed in other  tumors (cervix, nasopha rynx, 
stom ach, lung, etc.) whe re both local control and distant metastase s are signi ficant causes 
of  tre atment  failure.  More over,  original  primary chemotherapy trials  reporte d 
pathological response  rates of le ss than 10% 13, 17, providi ng the impet us to investi gate the 
combi nation of chemotherapy with radiation to increase the proportion of patients who 
might derive a potential surviva l benefit associa ted with a pathologica l response.  We 
have conduc ted two sequential studi es in LABC : the first one combi ned continuous
infusion 5 -FU and radiotherapy while  the second combi ned semiweekly paclitaxel with 
radiotherapy 14, 19-20, 22.

criteria for this study pre-selected patients with par ticularly advanced LABC insofa r as all 
patients were deemed ―inope rable,‖ i.e., in order to resect the prima ry tu mor the wound 
could be closed only wit h the interpositi on of a skin graft or a myo-cutaneous flap. For 
each  patient,  pre- treatment  breast  cancer biopsies  we re  analyzed  by 
[CONTACT_722508]/PR  hormon al receptors, HER -2/neu, and p53 over- 
expression.  p53  protein  over-expression  at  immunohi stoch emistry  was  used  as  a 
surroga te for p53 gene mutation 24. More over, initial tumor core biopsie s were analyzed 
by [CONTACT_722509] (RT-PCR) to measure expression of ge nes
expected to be associa ted with response to 5-FU and radiation, e.g., the main target 
enzyme of 5-FU, thymidylat e synth ase. Pre-operative c.i. 5-FU, 200 mg/m2/day was 
delivered for [ADDRESS_986767] lesson derived from this study wa s a definiti on of pathologica l response to chemo- 
radiation.  At  maste ctomy,  pathological  finding s  were  classifie d  on  the  basis  of 
persistence of invasive cancer. Pathologica l complete re sponse (pCR) defined the finding 
of no residual invasive cells in the breast and axillary contents;  pathological partial 
response described the presence of <[ADDRESS_986768] or noda l specimens. All other cases we re classifie d as no pathological response 
(pNR). This trial achieved a high response rate in large, inoper able LABC with an 
objec tive clinical response  rate of 71% a nd a pathologi cal response rate (pCR+ pPR) of
34%.  The pathological response rate of 5FU-RT compare s favorably with that of any

Eigh ty-four percent of the patients (32/38) in the trial were minorit y wome n. Import antly, 
the 5-FU/RT regimen was very we ll tolerated with no grade III or IV acute toxicities or 
increa sed toxiciti es durin g post -operative doxorubicin and cyclophospha mide (AC). With 
a media n follow- up of 5 years, ove rall surviva l of the entire group of 38 patients is 74% 
and disease-free surviva l is 58% (Table 1), which compare s favorably with neo-adjuvant 
chemotherapy.
We  then asked whether a pathologica l response to chemo-RT  could also be a 
surroga te endpoint  for surviv al in LABC. The patients who achieve d a pa thological 
response (pCR+ pPR) to 5-FU/RT have both a better DFS and OS than non-re sponde rs 
(p=0.023, and p=0.08, respectively), with only one  failure among the wome n who 
achieve d  pa thological  response 20,   27.  In  a ddition,  no  isol ated  chest  wall  or  noda l
recurr ences hav e occurred to dat e.
In addition to achievin g promi sing clinical results, thi s study prove d the feasibility 
of using biol ogical correlates from pre-tre atment tumor biopsies  to explor e associa tions 
with pathological response: patients whose tu mors had no evidence of p53 over- 
expression on immuno histochemistry were signific antly mor e likely to achieve a 
pathological response to the re gimen, compa red to patients whose tum ors over-expressed 
p53 (p= 0.010, Fishe r exact text). On mul tivariate analysis, lack of p53 ove r-expression
NYU 06-[ADDRESS_986774] 
evidenc e that wild t ype p53 tumors were more  likely to respond to the 5FU/RT  regimen. 
Since the major ity of patients who over-expressed p53 failed to achieve a pathologica l 
response, it made sense to investi gate the  use of agents like taxanes, whic h are differently 
affected b y p53 sta tus 14.
2.[ADDRESS_986775] shown that loss of norma l p53 function actually confers 
sensitivity to paclitaxel in some cell types because of an increa sed G2/M arrest leading to 
p53 indepe ndent cell death 33. This observation may unde rlie the preferenti al activity of 
paclitaxel against cancer cells compare d to norma l cells as well as its activity against 
tumors that are p53 mutated 34. More over, accumulation of cells at the G2/M checkpoint 
explains some of the in vivo radio-sensitizing effects of the drug 35. Interestingly, our 
group was able to document the kinetics of paclitaxel-induce d apoptosis and mitotic 
arrest in human tumor tissue 36. These finding s support the use of a semiweekly regimen 
as the optimal ra dio-sensitizing schedule in the c linic 19-20.
Another re ason for stud ying tax anes in a chemo-RT approa ch to LABC is the fact 
that several potential  markers of sensitivity to taxanes have been identi fied. Since  the 
microtubule is also a tar get of pa clitaxel, bioche mical medi ators that could affect 
microtubule stabilit y are expec ted to affect paclitaxel activity. For instance, the 
components  of mammali an microtubules are   and   -tubulin: the latter is the main target 
of paclitaxel action 37 and elevated class III and class IV   -tubu lin iso-forms were found 
in paclitaxel-resistant ovarian tum or ce lls 38. Met ablastin (also termed p19 a nd stathmin)
is  also  a   regulator  of  MT  dyna mics [ADDRESS_986776] for pac litaxel- 
resistance in vitro 40. Interestingly, MAP4 is one of the few genes known to be down- 
regulate d by [CONTACT_433915] p53, possi bly explaining the obser ved inverse relationship of p53 
status and paclitaxel activity. Othe r potential determin ants for response to paclitaxel are 
genes associa ted with the apoptot ic or cell-cycle regulation pathwa ys. Pac litaxel has been 
demonstra ted to cause the phosphorylation of bcl-2, whic h is believed to abroga te the 
anti-apoptot ic func tion of bc l-2 by [CONTACT_722510]-a popto tic molecule bax 41.
Final ly,  HER -2/neu  over-expression  was  shown  both  to  alter     -tubulin  iso-form 
expression  and  to  confer  resistance  to  paclitaxel 42.  Final ly,  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_346109] s  et  al.  reported 
resistance to radiation when HER -2/neu over-expression was induce d in vitro and in 
vivo, in a breast xenografts tumor model. They demonstra ted that a mon oclonal antibody
direc ted  against the HER -2/neu receptor affects repair of radiation -indu ced DNA damage 
and  e nhances  radio-sensitivity  of  human  breast  cancer  cells  ove r-expressing  HE R-
2/neu  43.

receptors were more  likely to respond to the tested regimen (p=0.009 and p=0.006, 
respectively). The findi ngs sugge st that tumor s withou t HER-2/n eu over-e xpression

Our two  consec utive chemo-RT phase I-II studies  prove d the feasibility of 
concurrent chemotherapy and radiation  as primary treatment for LABC. With the 
limita tions associ ated with a Phase I-II stud y, 5-yea r DFS and OS data from the FU/RT 
study are better than those reported by [CONTACT_121641] r investigators that have employed sequential 
treatment with post-operative ra diation in this disease. In both trials one out of three 
patients  achieve d  a  pathologica l  response  (pCR  or  pPR,  as  per  our  definition), 
significantly higher than the 5-15% pathologica l response rates reporte d in contempo rary

3.1       Assoc iation  of  Molecular Markers with Pathologi cal Response : Preliminary
Data
The two  pre liminary studies which combi ned tax anes and radiation (sec tions 2.7-2.8) also 
demonstra ted that  different molecular markers are associa ted with pathological response, 
supporting the hypothes is that diffe rent drugs combined with concurrent radiation are 
effective on different tumor types. In the 5FU/R T stud y, lack of p53 over-expression (i.e. 
wild  type  p53  tumors)  was  significantly  associ ated  with  the  achievement  of  a 
pathological response, whil e in the paclitaxel/RT study p53 status  had no relevance, but 
tumors without HER -2/neu over-expression we re more likely to respond to paclitaxel/RT. 
Based on these finding s, selecting a particul ar chemo-RT regimen based on the molecular 
characteristics of the tu mor should improve patholog ical response rates, thus potentiall y 
improving surviv al.
While intriguing , the data reporte d require validation in a much la rger sample of 
patients, ideally in a multi-institutional fashion that represents the multiethnic 
characteristics of LABC. More over, the availability of a moder n, compr ehensive basic 
research matrix of collaborating re searchers enables the multi-dimensiona l research 
strategy ne cessary to t he unde rstanding of the c omplexity associated w ith LAB C.

NYU 06-[ADDRESS_986780] cancer patients never reach 
a formal ―clinical  diagnosis‖  since they die before ever receiving medi cal treatment of 
any kind.  Thus,  the burde n of breast cancer incidenc e and morta lity is likely to be 
subst antially unde restimated. In addition, access to screening, early detection and timely 
medica l  care  are  not  options  available  to  the  vast  majo rity  of  wome n  worldwide, 
including a sizable subse t of minority, often unde rserved  wome n  in the U.S. These 
wome n are much more likely than those living in affluent  communities to present to 
medica l attention with large, palpable bre ast tumors, often LABC. W e are convince d that 
improve ments in our unde rstanding of how to mana ge, treat and minimize the 
compl ications of LABC represents an untappe d opportun ity for investigat ions aimed at 
reducing  the  burde n  of  morta lity for  breast  cancer.  To  this  aim,  a  clinical  research 
network of academic institutions in [ADDRESS_986781] int ernational sites capable of delivering the

establishment  of a comm on clinical trial in well-characterized distinct populations of 
LABC patients, while  conduc ting prospec tive tissue acquisi tion, molecular and genomi c

diffusion of standa rd proce dures that will enable the clinical and basic sc ientists to merge 
the data to perform the propose d clinical and labora tory analyses. The l eadership of the 
COE has identifie d this issue as central and has developed the necessary tools to assure 
international standa rdiza tion of infor mation, data acquisi tion, tissue acquisi tion and

While there are many resea rch efforts unde rway to identif y gene expression signatures 
associ ated with response  and failure of different tumors, including bre ast cancers, this 
approa ch is nove l in its examination of he terogeneous global  cohorts and the foc us of the

conjunction with molecular biology studi es of L ABC and ge nomic mutational studi es
NYU 06-209
page   18(described below), are expec ted to expedite identification of gene expression responses 
that will ultimately lead to tailore d treatment strategies and  new tar gets for intervention.
Project 3,  Molec ular and tumor cell biology. This research effort will identif y mo lecular 
and bioche mical signatures in LABC tumor cell responses that are linked to tumor 
sensitivity or resistanc e (progre ssion) to treatment, including hypoxi a, angiogen esis,

that describe the  experiences of each group in the mul ti-cultural, multi-national sample. 
Also, the study will develop qualitative approa ches and data that have the potential to 
greatly im prove  models for cross-c ultural behavior, and to aid in the development of

In gener al, the frequency and s everity of ne urologic manifestations we re dose- dependen t in 
patients rece iving si ngle-agent  Abraxan e®. The frequency of se nsory neu ropathy increased w ith 
cumulative dos e. No i ncidences o f grade 4 sensory neu ropathies were reported. Onl y one i ncident 
of motor neu ropathy (grade 2) was  obse rved.
Cran ial nerve pa lsies and v ocal cord paresis hav e been reported du ring post marketing 
survei llance of Abraxan e®. Because these events hav e been  reported duri ng cl inical prac tice, true 
estimates of frequ ency cannot be m ade and a c ausal relationshi p to the events has not been 
established.
Repo rts of au tonom ic neuropat hy re sulting in paralytic ileus have been received as part of the 
continuing surve illance of pac litaxel injection saf ety.
Ocular/visual distu rbances occur red in pat ients treated with Abraxan e® in single arm and
rando mized trials and 1% we re sev ere. The severe cases  (keratitis and bl urred vi sion) we re 
reported in pat ients in a single arm study who re ceived higher doses than those recommended 
(300 or 375 m g/m2). These effects gener ally hav e been reversible. Howev er, rare repor ts in the

13.       DATA  ANALYSIS /STATIS TICA L CONSID ERATIONS
13.1     Study  Objectives
The p rimary objective of the study is to confir m the pathological response rate of 34% 
(pCR+ pPR), re porte d for pa tients in the U S Pha se I-II trial44.
The ant icipate d powe r to interpret the results of the international clinical trial versus the 
US trial: An overall difference in pathologic response  rates between and South  Aftrica 
combi ned of + /- 24% c ompare d to the overall NYU c ohort  will be detectable with powe r
80% (150 to tal, 100 at NYU) and significa nce level ≤5%, 2-sided  binomial compar ison. 
(The inclusion of 20 a dditional  patients from India will yield a detectable difference of
+/- 22%.). For the comparison  of South Afric a individuall y to the NYU cohort, with 25 
patients/site, a diffe rence of +/-34% is detectable. Each of the cohorts will be analyzed 
separately.
The classi cal chi-squa re test will be used to compar e the three pathological response 
rates. If the test finds the rates differ as expec ted, we will identif y the cohorts with 
diffe rent rates using mul tiple compar ison tests and report confid ence intervals for the 
response rates withi n and across the cohorts, and for the ma gnitude of related differences 
and odds ratios. If there are no differences between the cohorts with respect to overall 
response ra tes, with a total of 150 patients, we can estimate the pathologic response  rate 
with 95% confid ence limits of +/-8%, if the expec ted ove rall rate is 34% in this 
confirmato ry stu dy.
Across  all cohorts, logistic regression models will be used to identif y pre dictor s of 
pathologic re sponse. If the proportion of pa tients with LABC with the predictor ra nges 
from 0.05 to 0.1 to 0.25 to 0.5, the detectable odds ratio at 0.05 level (2-sided) and 80% 
powe r ranges from 8.7 to 4.6 to 2.8 to 2.5 for the ove rall cohort  of 150 patients (assum ing 
path response ra te of 34%).
If the cohorts are similar with respect to pathologic response rates, then they can be 
combi ned for furthe r analysis of pre dictor s of progre ssion and surviva l. Progre ssion free 
surviva l  and  surviva l  will  also  be  estimated  in  each  cohort  individual ly  and  across 
cohorts. All patients will have compl eted at least one year of follow -up on study after 
diagnosis  and  be  evaluable  for  the  analysis  of  the  prim ary  endpoint  of  pathologic 
response to treatment in year [ADDRESS_986822] ete lon g term follow-up da ta are available.

This  proje ct  is  part  of the  LABC  Center  of  Excellence and  patients  will  be 
include d in the various projec ts to study genomic s, biom arkers and horm onal markers. A 
comm on random sample of [ADDRESS_986825] ete cohort of 150 patients enroll ed in the treatment proto col in Projec t 1 for study 
in Projects 2 (func tional genomic ), 3 (molec ular and bioche mical alterations), 4 (mut ation 
analysis), 7 (p53 pol ymorphisms) to allow a complete se t of da ta to be generated for the 
same subset of patients. Similarly, the study of cultural norms (Projec t 6) will be based 
on a stratified random sa mple. The approac h to using  a comm on sample of patients for 
each of the research projects that will not be conduc ted on all [ADDRESS_986826] stage of 
these analyses, we will use de scriptive  (nume rical and graphical) statis tics to summ arize 
the  baseline  clinical  and  dise ase  variables  for  eac h  cohort,  including  pathological
NYU 06-209
page   40response,  disea se progre ssion and surviva l of patients enroll ed on the clinical protocol. 
We will also use similar descriptive statis tics to compar e the da ta on the incomplete 
sample of 75 patients to the entire cohort. Next, we provide nonpa rametric analyses 
including confid ence intervals for various proportions (e.g. response  rates) within each 
cohort  and  differences  in  proportions  betwee n  cohorts.  For  each  projec t,  variable 
selection strategies will be used. Once the variable selection within the projec t is 
compl eted, we will fit logistic regression models to study the relationships betwee n the 
predictor s (gene profil es, etc) and pathologic response to treatment (compl ete vs not) 
using variable selection tools. For time to progre ssion and surviva l, we will develop 
proportional hazard models. Finall y, we will describe approac hes to analysis of da ta with 
partially obser ved covariates. The 3 steps in these analyses includ e: 1. Use all data 
available in e ach individual projec t to select variables predictive of the outcom es 
(pathologic response to treatment, etc) in that projec t. For proj ects 1, 3-[ADDRESS_986827]
variables (i. e. genes) pre dictive of the outcome 53. We will then pool the se ts of va riables 
together to include the complete data model in step 2. Use the variables identifi ed as 
predictive of pathologic response from each individual projec t as explana tory va riables. 
Use compl ete data (75 patient sample) to fit a logistic reg ression mode l with variable 
selection proce dure such as Lasso to identi fy the varia bles predictive of pathologic 
response. 3. Use all available data on 150 patients with variables selected in Step 2 (som e 
of whic h are only partiall y observed) and use maxim um likelihood  metho ds and the EM 
algorithm to fit the final model.
Some spec ific methods to be used are described here:
Logis tic  Regression :  Mult iple  logistic  regre ssion  models [ADDRESS_986828] 
predictive  variables for the binar y outcome  variables such as pathologic response (e.g., 1
for response  and 0 for non-re sponse ) to the treatment of LABC characterized in Projec t 1. 
Othe r variables from  the studied subjec ts will be used as explana tory va riables, including 
gene signatures described in Projec t 2, mol ecular and bioche mical markers from Projec t
3, immuno logical factors of Proje ct 4, mut ational factors from the selected pa tients of 
Projec t 5, estrog en metabolites from Projec t 6, genotypes from  Project 7 and other 
demographic factors (a ge, behaviora l-cultural, soci oeconom ic status, etc ).
Variabl e    Se lection   Methods :   Mult iple   logistic   regression   with   variable   selection 
procedure such as Lasso [ADDRESS_986829] Angle Re gression 56 will be used to identify a subset 
of the predictors among the many fac tors to patholog ic response,  progre ssion to local 
recurrence or me tastatic disea se, and surviva l, respectively. With the l arge amount of da ta 
obtaine d   from   thi s   stud y   concerning   mul ti-ethnic   cohorts   and   mul ti-disciplina ry
collaborative re search projec ts, we can attempt to characterize sets of predictors that are 
comm on across cohorts as well as those specific to each individual cohort, ranging from 
genetic, molecular to immuno logical factors. To assess the performan ce of these models, 
we will use c ross-va lidation methods.
Interactions :  It is natural to expec t that there might be interactions a mong  the outcom es
(patho logic  response,  progre ssion,  a nd  surviva l),  and  bio logical  fac tors  (e.g.  ge ne
NYU 06-[ADDRESS_986830] 2, and genomi c mut ations, Projec t 5) or genotypes, Proje ct 7) and other 
groups of variables (e.g. behavioral and cultural). We will employ stati stical models to 
investig ate th ese poten tial predictor s concurrent ly, and the in terpretation of these 
predictor s  and  findin gs  will  be  done  in  collaboration  with  COE  in vestigators.  For 
example, ethnic diffe rences are documented in outcome s of L ABC patients 3-5, [ADDRESS_986831] ment f or other fa ctors in the model.
Treatme nt of Data with Parti ally Obse rved Cov ariat es: Since  several of the proje cts (2,
4, 5, 8) will be performe d using a randoml y selected subset of the subje cts, we will have 
compl ete data available for these  75 selected subjec ts; data on the remaining [ADDRESS_986832] ete and inco mplete data sets to verify thi s assumption.

Investigators at the Amr ita Institute of Medi cal Science s (AIMS) in  Cochin India and 
NYUSOM a gree to participa te in a data-shar ing arrangement  for the i nvestigation of 
outcome s  yielded  from  this  study.  Specifically,  patient  demographic  and  clinical 
treatment data, toxicity data, and pathological outcome s are to be collected and store d 
locally at AIMS, and subseque ntly de -identifi ed and share d with investi gators at 
NYUSOM for the purpose of joint analysis and reportin g in co-authored presentations 
and sc ientific papers.
13.2.[ADDRESS_986833]  data  mana ger  at  NYU.  Onc e  the  discrepancy  is  closed,  by  [CONTACT_722531]
―resolve d‖  or  ―irresolva ble‖,  the  da ta  is  ma rked  clean  and  a n  audit  trail  is
gener ated by [CONTACT_941] s ystem.
All k ey end point s will be sourc e verified by a second person at each site and 
errors will be corrected. Once the data is verified and all discrepancies are closed, 
the data can be locke d/frozen. Locking and freezing can be done at diffe rent 
granular levels and will follow institutional SOPs and any spe cific requirements 
for the proje ct.
Secu rity measures that will be taken in order to protec t patient data will include 
firewall technolo gy and database level security which will be achieved by 
[CONTACT_722532] g that the 
users authenti cate them selves using userid and password. Additi onal security for 
data transfer between remote clients and servers will be achieved by [CONTACT_57971] g digital 
certific ates/S SL. All data will be backed-up to tape periodica lly accordin g to the 
Institutional SOPs. All da ta will be store d for at least [ADDRESS_986834] tracking fea tures, data searching algorit hms, data explora tion 
and visua lization.
The d atabase is accessible over the Internet from other institutions, making it 
simple for membe rs of the COE to collaborate on microarray projects. Data can be 
uploade d and analyzed from any workstation via a web interface, onto a server that is 
maintaine d in a secure data center and backed up autom atically to tape. With the 
appropri ate  permissions  (userid  and  password),  users  can  directly upload  data  for  a 
proje ct, or view data that has been loaded and analyzed at NYU. Data will be store d for 
no less than [ADDRESS_986835] cancer: a prognostic factor 
for dist ant metastasis. J. Cli n. Onc ol. 1992; 10: 15 34-1539.

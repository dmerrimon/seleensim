v.3.1 January 27, 2017  1. BACKGROUND INFORMATI ON 
1.1 INTRODUCTION  
Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common type of skin cancer, with almost 3 million cases 
diagnosed each year in the [LOCATION_002]. (Skin Cancer Foundation 2011, Rogers et al 2010)  The incidence of BCC is increasing 10% each year worldwide and its prevalence is expected to equal that of all other cancers combined in the near future. (Madan et al 2010)    Though e xtreme ly rare, some patients have progressive mutilating  metastatic BCC (mBCC) or 
locally advanced BCC  (laBCC), which can be fatal .  Most BCC s are not life -threatening, but 
they are still quite morbid as they commonly occur  on the head and neck.  Some BCC lesions 
grow very quickly and are associated with poorer outcomes . Features of these ‘high risk’ BCC 
(hrBCC) lesions were defined by [CONTACT_68015] (NCCN) and this hrBCC cohort was highlighted as one of particular concern. ( See Appendix 1, NCCN 2011).   
Since hrBCC tumors are much more common, they actually represent a much bigger public health problem than mBCC or laBCC.  Due to its superior cure rate, Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS)  is widely accepted as the gold 
standard for tr eatment for the majority of  BCC  tumors,
 especially l aBCC and hrBCC. (Mi khail 
and Mohs 1993, NCCN 2011)  Even with the utilization of the Mohs tissue preservation technique, surgery can be quite extensive resulting in signific ant disfigurement, depending on the 
size and anatomic location of the lesion.    While s ize of tumor is a predictive factor of  patient outcomes, visual examination  can frequently 
be deceiving and local microscopic invasion may be much more extensive than initially thought.  In some cases, t umor see n at the skin surface may only represent one fifth of its microscopic 
spread . (Batra and Kelley 2004)   Since many tumors exhibit significant subclinical extension,  
the resulting surgical defect after tumor clearance can be considerably larger than the presenting 
lesion, often necessitating complex, costly, and time -consuming repairs, compromising the final 
cosmetic appearance or function.     Adjuvant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_777267].  Topi[INVESTIGATOR_12491], such as imiquimod, have been investigated in the past for this purpose.  They are not widely used  due to 
concern that the variable penetration  of topi[INVESTIGATOR_777268], 
leading the clinician to incorrectly believe that the tumor has been completely cleared.  (Harting 
et al 2007)  An o ral agent, that  hypothetically would be distributed to the tumor uniformly , may 
be bet ter suited f or neoadjuvant treatment o f BCC prior to surgery.  In fact, in selected lesions , 
oral treatment could  possibly even lead to complete eradication  of tumor tissue, thereby 
[CONTACT_777291] .  Vismodegib is an orally delivered small Hedgehog 
pathway inhibitor (HPI) that shows promise in the management of BCC.  V ismodegib  was 
granted priority review and was recently approved by [CONTACT_941] U. S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of adults with metastatic basal cell carcinoma or with locally advanced basal cell carcinoma that has recurred following surgery or who are not candidates for surgery, and who are not candidates for radiation.  
[ADDRESS_1067495] by [CONTACT_777292] ( Hh) pathway directly, disrupting the 
development of cancers that are due to PTCH mutations or SMO mutations, like those seen in 
the majority of BCCs . (Lorusso et al 2011, Von Hoff et al 2009)  An estimated 90% of BCC 
tumors have mutations in the Hh signaling pathway, either an inactivation of the PTCH mutation (loss -of function mutation) or an activation of the SMO15 mutation (gain of function), that 
disrupt normal signaling between  cells and lead to a proliferation of basal cells and the 
development of BCC. (Rubin and De Sauvage 2006, Hopper and Scott 2006)  For this reason, inhibiting the Hh signaling pathway has been identified as a therapeutic target in the treatment of BCC.  
 Though many BCC s possess the same mutation in the Hh pathway , BCC is a very heterogeneous 
tumor type when considering all of the known histologic subtypes.  Twenty -three subtypes of 
BCC have been recorded in the literature, but for practical purpose s these have been combined 
and three subtypes (infiltrative/morpheaform, nodular and superficial) are used clinically. (Sexton et al 1990, Wade and Ackerman 1978, Rippey 1998)  The most common type of BCC is nodular (70%). (Weedon 2009, Mosterd et al 2011)  Superficial subtypes comprise around 10-15% of BCCs.  About 10-15% of BCCs are categorized as infiltrative/morpheaform subtype for 
clinical management  and considered to be an “aggressive” subtype of BCC .  Infiltrative BCCs 
and morpheaform BCC have different appear ances histologically, but are considered together for 
management due to their similar aggressive clinical course.   
 Histologic features are well known to impact tumor biologic b ehavior and response to treatment.  
Treatment options for BCC are often curative when considering clinical and histologic features, the latter a more powerful prognostic factor with laBCCs  and hrBCCs. (Walling et al 2004)  For 
example, it is well recognized  that infiltrative/morpheaform tu mors are associated with increased 
rates o f recurrence and poorer prognosis since the ir tumor characteristics make it difficult to 
obtain clear margins during surgery. (Walling et al 2004)  These BCC subtypes frequently have tumor nests outside of the tumor bulk.  During surgery, tumor remnants may go undetected by [CONTACT_777293].  If a histological response to vismodegib in aggressive subtypes can be demonstrated pre- operatively, clinicians may possess greater confidence that all 
tumor nests have been eradicated and clear margins have been obtained during surgery, leading to improved patient outcomes. Conversely, s uperficial BCCs are considered to have non-
aggressive tumor behavior and are also more likely than other subtypes to be located on the low-risk locations of the trunk and extremities.  (Weedon 2009)  These tumors, which typi[INVESTIGATOR_777269], nonetheless can require significant circumferential margins of normal tissue to ensure complete removal, again impacting cosmesis, function and or cost.   
It is unknown if BCC histologic subtype impacts tumor response to vismodegib.  Data from previous studies, where inclusion was open to all subtypes of basal cell skin cancer, is predominantly based on nodular subtype.  Mos t currently re cruiting studies investigating 
vismodegib in BCC do not specify a tumor subtype for inclusion, but if one is specified for 
inclusion, it is nodular subtype only .  (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier [STUDY_ID_REMOVED])  No previous 
or ongoing studies hav e stipulated  inclusion of other histological subtypes of BCC.   
 
[ADDRESS_1067496] 
in providing a greater understanding of the efficacy of vismodegib in BCCs of aggressive subtypes and of other histologic subtypes.  This study may provide better guidance for targeted, individualized information about a patient’s unique tumor biology and optimize management of BCCs in our patients.    1.[ADDRESS_1067497] criteria  version 
1.0 was completed if  tumors had radiologically measurable disea se. Otherwise, pre-defined 
clinical response measures were employed.   An o verall response rate of 58% was observed .
 (Von 
Hoff et al 2009)  The most common response, in 17 of 33 cases, was partial response. Complete response was seen in 2 cases. Stable disease was observed in 12 cases. (Von Hoff et al 2009) No  
dose-limiting toxic events or grade 5 events were observed with a single grade 4 adverse event (asymptomatic hyponatremia) reported. The more significant and frequent adverse events were GI related with dysgeusia and muscle spasm reported.  
 Further evidence of the efficacy of vismodegib in the treatme nt of BCC was shown in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_777270], a Phase II single -arm, non- randomized trial of single -agent vismodegib at 150 
mg/day to progression or intolerance with 104 patients enrolled: (33 mBCC, 71 LA BCC).   The 
study met its primary endpoint overall response rate (ORR) by [CONTACT_223225] (IRF)  and showed shrinkage of tumors in a pre-defined percentage of patients
8.  A preliminary 
safety assessment showed the most common adverse events were consistent with previous experience with vismodegib. The most common adverse events were muscle spasms, hair loss, altered taste sensation, weight loss, fatigue, nausea, decreased appetite and diarrhea. A detailed safety assessment is ongoing.  
 
Therapy  with vismodegib has the potential to significantly decrease morbidity of the patients’ 
BCC either through complete clearance of tumor or by [CONTACT_777294].  Though BCC expected to respond favorably to treatment with vismodegib, s urgical 
excision by [CONTACT_777295] 6 months of initial consultation; this study will not adversely affect the current standard of care in the management of BCC  in non-responders. 
 In a recent Phase 2 trial, vismodegib was  also reported to slow the development of BCC s in 
patients with B asal C ell Nevus Syndrome ( BCNS ), a rare genetic disorder which causes patients 
to develop hundreds of large BCCs. 
 (Tang et al 2011) .  Further studies are needed, but 
vismodegib ma y slow the progression of BCC in patients without BCNS .

v.3.1 January 27, 2017  2. STUDY OBJECTIVES  
 
2.1 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES  
 To compare the efficacy of vismodegib in various histologic subtypes of high risk 
and/or locally advanced basal cell skin cancer  
 
2.2 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES   
 To evaluate the onset of efficacy of vismodegib dur ing 24 weeks of treatment in 
various histologic subtypes of high risk and/or locally advanced basal cell skin cancer  
 
 To evaluate the safety and tolerability of vismodegib over 24 weeks of treatment in subjects with high risk and/or locally advanced basal cell skin cancer  
 
 To evaluate patient reported outcome (PRO) measures during 24 weeks of treatment with vismodegib in subjects with high risk and/or locally advanced basal cell skin 
cancer   
  
3. STUDY DESIGN  
This is a Phase 2B two -site, open-label, nonrandomized 24- week study of the efficacy and safety 
of vismodegib (150 mg PO daily) in subjects with high risk and/or locally advanced basal cell 
carcinoma.  A total of 36 subjects with infiltrative/morphe aform, nodular, or superficial BCC 
will be enrolled in the study.  Each subtype group will have a minimum of [ADDRESS_1067498] more than 16 subjects.     At Treatment Initiation Visit ( Baseline/Day 1 ), eligible subjects will begin a [ADDRESS_1067499]- treatment 
histopathologic evaluation will be performed at Week 24 (End of Treatment visit) .  Subje cts will 
be eligible to enter the  Observ ation period in lieu of surgery if their target lesion displays 
complete histologic response on biopsy specimens obtained at Week [ADDRESS_1067500] dose of study drug.  Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO) data will be collected at baseline visit, during treatment, end of treatment/early termination visit, surgical visit, and study exit (post-surgery) visit, and at first Observation period visit (when applicable)  Safety assessments including adverse event (AE) monitoring and concomitant medications will be performed at each visit.  
 The rationale for using 24 -week treatment schedule was based on previous data from pi[INVESTIGATOR_30274].  Data from a previous trial of 33 subjects with advanced BCC, demonstrated that 94% (17/18) of responders responded by 24-weeks. (Von Hoff et al 2009)  In non-responders, treatment b eyond [ADDRESS_1067501] meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for enrollment into the study:

informed consent.)   
6. STUDY METHODOLOGY  
 
6.1 STUDY PROCEDURES  
 The following sections describe in detail all study procedures.  A flow chart of study procedures is presented at the end of the protocol (Appendix 6).  
 
 
6.1.1 Pre-study S creening  visit  
Subjects will be screened within 4 Weeks (+/ -3 days) prior to the Treatment  Initiation 
(Baseline/Day 1 ) visit to confirm that they meet the entrance criteria for the study. The study 
investigator or sub- investigator will discuss with each subject the nature of the study, its 
requirements, and its restrictions. Written informed co nsent must be obtained prior to 
performance of any protocol -specific procedures.  
 
The following procedures will be performed at Pre -study Screening visit, within 4 weeks prior to 
Treatment Initiation ( Baseline/Day 1 , Visit 2) visit 
 
 Confirmation of inclusi on criteria, excluding histologic confirmation of basal cell skin 
cancer of target lesion . 
 Identification of skin lesion(s) clinically suspi[INVESTIGATOR_777274]. 
 Recording of medical history. (Medical history is defined as a disease or syndrome that is ongoing at or stopped before Informed Consent.) 
14 
v.3.1 January 27, 2017   Recording of history of alcohol and drug use, smoking status (current smoker, current 
heavy smoker >20 cigarettes per day), and average weekly alcohol consumption (units/week), where a unit contains 12 g of pure alcohol, an amount equivalent to that contained in 5 oz (a glass or 148 mL) of wine, 12 oz (355 mL) of beer, or 1.5 oz (44 mL) of 90 proof of spi[INVESTIGATOR_2120]. (The intent is to monitor the subject’s alcohol consumption during the study to determine if  it has impact on the efficacy, disease state and any co -
morbidities.  It is the PI’s discretion to determine acceptable levels of consumption or abuse.  Alcohol and/or substance abuse are exclusionary.)   
 Recording of current medications and all other drugs (including non-prescription drugs, vitamins, and dietary supplements) taken within 4 weeks prior to Screening. 
 Complete physical examination including full-body skin exam. 
o Physical examination includes: height, weight, general appearance, skin (other than primary diagnosis), HEENT (head, eyes, ears, nose and throat), heart 
(auscultation), lungs (auscultation), abdomen (palpation and auscultation), lower extremities (peripheral edema), neurologic (mental status, station, gait, reflexes, motor and sensory function, coordination) and lymph nodes. 
 Vital signs [blood pressure (BP); heart or pulse rate; and oral, tympanic, or temporal temperature].  
 Males are reminded that they must use effective measures to avoid pregnancy in their partner at all times, even after vasectomy, for [ADDRESS_1067506] dose.  
 Females are reminded that they must use 2 effective methods to avoid pregnancy for 1 month prior to start of study medication, during therapy, and for 9 months after completing therapy.  
 For  women who do not want to conceive in the future but are still women of childbearing potential:  
o Two negative pregnancy tests with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL at least [ADDRESS_1067507] be done immediately preceding the  beginning of therapy and after the patient has used 2 effective measures to avoid pregnancy  for 1 month. 
 Laboratory evaluation at baseline to evaluate abnormalities in hematocrit/platelet counts, 
renal or hepatic function and electrolytes . 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Target lesion  selection  
 If multiple lesions are deemed to be suspi[INVESTIGATOR_777275], up to 4 lesions will be considered for investigation and designated “potential target lesion s”.  Potential target lesion(s) will be selected at clinician discretion using 
clinical and dermoscopic findings and in consideration of patient preference.

include the pre-biopsy area.  Thi s specimen will be labeled the tumor “debulking” specimen . 
 Second, marginal tissue will be excised in an attempt to completely remove the tumor until clear surgical margins are obtained, providing the patient the known standard of care.  This tissue will be labeled “tumor margins” specimen. Peripheral and deep margins will be examined and recorded if positive or negative.  If either peripheral or deep margins is positive, additional surgical excisions will be done in the Mohs tissue orientation fashion  until no tumor cells are observed and surgical margins are deemed negative, as is standard of care.  In the event that only superficial BCC (sBCC) remains at the surgical margin, it will be at the discretion of the managing physician if further surgery, an a lternative treatment modality, or observation will 
occur.

of a palpable or visible tumor. 
 
6.2.[ADDRESS_1067521] classification into 
infiltrative/morpheaform, nodular, or subtypes (Sexton et al, 1990.)  Tumors with more than one subtype (i.e. “mixed” subtype) will be categorized by [CONTACT_777301].  The tumor subtypes will also be recorded by [CONTACT_777302].  Histologic subtypes will be defined as Table 1.  
 Histologic subtype                                                       Definition  
 
Nodular (70%)  Large and small, well -circumscribed nests of basaloid cells in the dermis, 
accompanied by [CONTACT_41157] -like retraction from surrounding stroma  
 
 
Superficial (10 -15%)  Proliferation of atypi[INVESTIGATOR_777277] -like retraction of the palisaded basal cells from subjacent 
stroma  
 
 
Morpheaform (5- 10%)  One to two cells thick columns of basaloid cells enmeshed in a dense collagenized 
stroma containing proplastic fibroblasts.  The tumors are poorly demarcated, 
showing widespread invasion of the reticular dermis and penetration in the 
subcutaneous tissue  
 
Infiltrative (5 -10%)   
Irregularly sized and shaped nests of tumor cells with sharp angulation of their peripheral contours and occasional foci of slit -like retraction; frequently fibrotic 
stroma with plumb desmoplastic stromal fibroblasts.  
 
       Table 1.  Histologic classification of BCC (Adopted from Mosterd et al 2011.)  
 
 
6.3.2 Pre-study Screening V isit biopsy specimens  
Biopsy specimens will be processed by [CONTACT_777303]’s Dermatopathology Laboratory for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) assessment and immunohistochemical staining.  Histologic assessment will be performed by a board -certified 
Dermatopathologist.  If pathology of the target lesion does not demonstrate basal cell skin cancer, the subject will be excluded from the study.    Breslow depth or “invasion index” of deepest basal cell skin cancer cells will be recorded.  This may include small nests of cells outside  of the bulk of the tumor.   
 
The thickness of the tumor will be measured from below the stratum corneum to the bottom of 
the deepest tumor nest using an ocular micrometer (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_777278]) to the precision of 
0.[ADDRESS_1067522] tumor cells on any biopsy will be recorded.  In tumors with multiple su btypes, a diagram will be created to denote areas of each histological 
subtype to determine anatomic location of cells of different subtypes and depth of tumor cells of different histological subtype . 
 
24 
v.3.1 January 27, 2017  Photography of pathologic slide will be performed. 
 Immunohistochemical evaluation of tumor tissue will also be performed in order to estimate the 
cellular density and composition of the pre- treatment lesion.  
  
6.3.3 Week 12  and Week 24 V isit biopsy specimens  
 Week 12  and Week 24 biopsy specimens will be processed and examined in the manner 
outlined for biopsies performed during the screening visits.   
 
 Residual tumor  
o Evidence of any histologic change in residual tumor tissue compared to pre-treatment biopsy specimens  
o Estimate of  changes in cellular density and composition compared to screening 
visit 
 
 Area of Tumor Clearance  
o Assessment of histologic clearance in areas of apparent clinical tumor clearance  
 Additional immunohistochemical staining with anticytokeratin (AE1/AE3) and Ber -EP4 will be 
performed to delineate tumor from inflammation when necessary.    
  
6.3.4 Surgical Excision specimen  
Pathologic evaluation of “debulking” specimen and “tumor margins” specimen will be 
performed in the manner of the biopsy and Week [ADDRESS_1067523] part of lesion.  Histopathologic subtype(s) will be recorded, and comment made as to tissue location of each subtype noted.  Photography of surgical specimens will also be performed.   In a manner as performed on biopsy specimen, diagram will be created to include tracing of different areas of histological subtype.  Depth of deepest tumor cells will be recorded.  A percentage estimate will be determ ined as to the histologic subtypes of the majority of tumor cells within the surgical 
specimen.   
 FUTURE USE OF BLOOD, TISSUE OR DATA  
The investigator will request permission from subjects to allow tissue to be used in the future for research purposes.  Subjects may decline future use of tissue. The specimens taken during the tissue collection as specified for this research study include the sample to be used in the future. No extra tissue will be taken for future research purposes.  
  The tissue may be used to further evaluate Basal Cell Skin Cancer.  All tissue specimens will be labeled with a study ID code, and study assigned pathology number.  The investigator will maintain a list of the participants and code numbers in a locked file with access limited to the study team.  
 
25 
v.3.1 January 27, 2017  The investigator may share the tissue (with code only) with other researchers at Saint Louis 
University and at other research centers. Other investigators will not have access to identifying information.      All specimens will be kept indefinitely, and will be maintained in the Biospecimens 
Accessioning and Processing (BAP) Core Lab at Mayo Clinic [LOCATION_012]. .     
6.4 INTERCURRENT DISEASE  TREATMENT AND CONCOM ITANT 
MEDICATIONS  
 6.4.1 Intercurrent Disease Treatment  
 
Subjects who develop additional tumors during the study may receive conventional forms of treatment for the non- target tumors during the treatment and follow -up periods if the following 
criteria are met:  
  The tumor(s) are sufficiently distal from the target tumor to prevent interference with the target tumor (at least 5 cm)  
 The treatment is not listed in Exclusion Criteria  
 The treatment will not affect the target lesion(s)  
 
6.4.[ADDRESS_1067524] during the course of the study should also be recorded on this form.  Local anesthetics used for pre-study biopsies and target tumor excisions need not be recorded.  Over-the-counter medicinal products (dietary supplements, herbal medications, etc) s hould also be recorded.  Data recorded will include name [CONTACT_11889], 
dose, unit, frequency, route, indication, and start and stop dates.  
6.[ADDRESS_1067525]’ s participation in the study will be approximately 28  weeks.  
Subjects will be expected to visit the clinic for 10 scheduled study visits.  Up to 12 (three sampling biopsies on 4 possible target lesions) will be performed at the pre- study screening visit, 
[ADDRESS_1067526] 
presents with any of these characteristics, treatment with vismodegib will be stopped before 24 weeks : 
1) Pregnancy  
2) 20% increase in target lesion tumor size 
 
 
6.6.[ADDRESS_1067527] who does not comply with the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be withdrawn from further participation in the study.  Subjects may also be discontinued if the investigator has determined that the subject has AEs of severe intensity or duration to warrant discontinuation.  If a subject discontinues due to AE, the subje ct 
will be followed until the AE has resolved.   Any subject who receives study medications or placebo must complete EOT procedures including the Mohs surgical excision, and the investigator must complete the end-of- study 
Subject Status form.  
 The investigator is encouraged to carefully select subjects who are likely to complete all study procedures.  
6.7 TREATING OVERDOSE  
 
Overdose is unexpected due to the dose level administered with oral administration.   There is no information on overdosage in humans. In c linical trials, vismodegib  capsule was administered at 
540 mg orally once daily; exposure did not increase between [ADDRESS_1067528] on fertility with data showed in earlier studies of amenorrhea.   Subjects (male and female) who 
desire to conceive in the future are excluded from the study.  Females of reproductive potential must use effective m easures to avoid pregnancy during therapy 
and for [ADDRESS_1067529] dose of vismodegib .   
27 
v.3.1 January 27, 2017   
The anticipated pregnancy prevention program includes the following measures for women of childbea ring potential: 
a) two negative pregnancy tests with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL at least [ADDRESS_1067530] be done immediately preceding the  beginning of therapy and after the patient has used 2 forms of contraception for 1 month. 
b) Urine pregnancy test at each visit.  
c) Female patients must use [ADDRESS_1067531] dose (condom with spermicide is the effective method 
of contraception per approved labeling for vismodegib). 
a) Study medication will NOT be dispensed at each visit until the results  of pregnancy have 
been reviewed by [CONTACT_1704] . 
b) Reminder to use effective measures to avoid pregnancy  will be performed throughout the 
study treatment for both men and women 
 Female patients do not have to follow the aforementioned measures to avoid pregnancy  IF they 
agree to abide to the following conditions: 
• have sto pped having their period for 12 months in a row (menopause) and their doctor 
says they are in menopause or clinically fit the criteria for menopause  
• had both of their ovaries or uterus taken out by [CONTACT_44850] 
• their ovaries do not work and they cannot get pregnant (confirmed by [CONTACT_221003]) 
 
7. REPORTING OF ADVERSE  EVENTS  
 
7.[ADDRESS_1067532] of monitoring and reporting adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) that are considered related to study drug, all events of  death, and any 
study specific issue of concern.  
 7.1.[ADDRESS_1067533] (IMP) or other protocol-imposed intervention, regardless of attribution. 
 This includes the following: 
28 
v.3.1 January 27, 2017  • AEs not previously observed in the subject that emerge during the protocol- specified AE 
reporting period, including signs or symptoms associated with Basal Cell Carcinoma that 
were not present prior to the AE reporting period. 
• Complications that occur as a result of protocol-mandated interventions (e.g., invasive 
procedures such as cardiac catheterizations).  
 
If applicable, AEs that occur prior to assignment of study treatment associated with medication washout, no treatment run-in, or other protocol-mandated intervention.  Preexisting medical conditions (other than the condition being studied) judged by [CONTACT_95048]-specified AE reporting period.   
7.1.2 Serious Adverse Events  
An AE should be classified as an SAE if the following criteria are met:  
• It results in death (i.e., the AE actually causes or leads to death).  
• It is life threatening (i.e.,  the AE, in the view of the investigator, places the subject at 
immediate risk of death. It does not include an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe 
form, might have caused death.). 
• It requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
• It results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e., the AE results in 
substantial disruption of the subject’s ability to conduct normal life functions). 
• It results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a mother exposed to the IMP. 
• It is considered a signific ant medical event by [CONTACT_188212] (e.g., may jeopardize the subject or may require medical/surgical intervention 
to prevent one of the outcomes listed above).  
7.2 METHODS AND TIMING FOR ASSESSING AND RECORDING SAFETY VARIABLES  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all AEs and SAEs that are observed or reported during the study are collected and reported to the FDA, appropriate IRB(s), and Genentech, Inc. in accordance with CFR 312.32 (IND Safety Reports).  
7.2.[ADDRESS_1067534] administration of study treatment or study discontinuation/termination, whichever is earlier. After this period, investigators should only report SAEs that are attributed to prior study treatment.  Any subject who has an adverse event deemed related to the study treatment in this trial, will be followed until reve rsibility is established. This may occur after study completion at the subject’s  
regular clinic follow -up visits.  
 
[ADDRESS_1067535], or other means will be reported appropriately. Each reported AE or SAE will be described by [CONTACT_13662] (i.e., start and end dates), regulatory seriousness criteria if applicable, suspected relat ionship to the study drug 
(see following guidance), and actions taken.  To ensure consistency of AE and SAE causality assessments, investigators should apply the following general guideline:  
 Yes 
There is a plausible temporal relationship between the onset of the AE and administration of study drug, and the AE cannot be readily explained by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state, intercurrent illness, or concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; and/or the AE follows a known pattern of response to study drug; and/or the AE abates or resolves upon discontinuation of study drug or dose reduction and, if applicable, reappears upon re- challenge.  
 No 
Evidence exists that the AE has an etiology other than the study drug (e.g., preexisting medical condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, or concomitant medication); and/or the AE has no plausible temporal relationship to study drug administration (e.g., cancer diagnosed [ADDRESS_1067536] dose of study drug).  
 Expected adverse events are those adverse events that are listed or characterized in the Package Insert or current Investigator Brochure.   Unexpected adverse events are those not listed in the Package Insert (P.I.) or current Investigator Brochure (I.B.) or not identified. This includes adverse events for which the specificity or severity is not consistent with the description in the P.I. or I.B. For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected if the P.I. or I.B. only referred to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis.  
 
7.[ADDRESS_1067537] evaluation time points should be adopted. Examples of non-directive questions include:  
• “How have you felt since your last clinical visit?”  
• “Have you had any new or changed health problems since you were last here?”  
 
7.3.[ADDRESS_1067538] medical terminology/concepts when reporting AEs or SAEs. 
Avoid colloquialisms and abbreviations.  
30 
v.3.1 January 27, 2017  [IP_ADDRESS] Diagnosis vs. Signs and Symptoms 
If known at the time of reporting, a diagnosis should be reported rather than individual signs and 
symptoms (e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than jaundice, asterixis, and elevated transam inases). However, if a constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be medically 
characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, it is ok to report the information that is currently available. If a diagnosis is subsequently established, it should be reported as follow-up information.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Deaths  
All deaths that occur during the protocol-specified AE reporting period regardless of attribution, 
will be reported to the appropriate parties. When recording a death, the event or condition t hat 
caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be reported as the single medical concept. If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of reporting, report “Unexplained Death”.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Preexisting Medical Conditions  
A preexisting medical condition is one that is present at the start of the study. Such conditions 
should be reported as medical and surgical history. A preexisting medical condition should be re-assessed throughout the trial and reported as an AE or SAE only if the frequency, severity, or character of  the condition worsens during the study. When reporting such events, it is important 
to convey the concept that the preexisting condition has changed by [CONTACT_9672] (e.g., “more frequent headaches”).  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_210821]. If a subject is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9615] a medical or surgical procedure as a result of an AE, the event responsible for the procedure, not the procedure itself, should be reported as the SAE. For example, if a subject is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15428], record the heart condition that necessitated the by[CONTACT_13664].  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_777279]: 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_210822] 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_777280] 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15432]. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancy  
If a female subject becomes pregnant while receiving investigational therapy or within [ADDRESS_1067539] dose of VISMODEGIB , a report should be completed and expeditiously submitted 
to the Genentech, Inc. Follow-up to obtain the outcome of the pregnancy should also occur. Abortion, whether accidental, therapeutic, or spontaneous, should always be classified as serious, and expeditiously reported as an SAE. Similarly, any congenital anomaly/birth defect in a child born to a female subject exposed to the VISMODEGIB  should be reported as an SAE. 
 
31 
v.3.1 January 27, 2017  [IP_ADDRESS] Post-Study Adverse Events  
The investigator should expeditiously report any SAE occurring after a subject has completed or 
discontinued study participation if attributed to prior VISMODEGIB  exposure. If the investigator 
should become aware of the development of cancer or a congenital anomaly in a subsequently conceived offspring of a female subject who participated in the study, this should be reported as an SAE.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Reconciliation of Study Drug Supply  
Investigators should conduct reconciliation for the product. Genentech and the investigator will

patient misses a dose (e.g., due to emesis), he or she should be instructed not to take or make up 
that dose and to resume dosing with the next scheduled dose.  Missed doses will not be made 
up.  Patients will be instructed to bring all unused capsules to each study visit for assessment of 
compliance.  
 
Sufficient drug supplies for [ADDRESS_1067546] for returning used and opened 
medication to the clinic.  Resealable bags will be dispensed at the same time medication is dispensed.  At the Treatment Initiation Visit (Baseline/Day 1) , and at the monthly interval, the study ce nter 
will dispense a bottle of  study drug to be used until the next interval visit at which drug will be 
dispensed.    At each time medication is dispensed: 
• Dispense a resealable plastic bag  
• Write the date dispensed on both sides of the 2- part label, located on  the carton  
• Affix the detachable portion of the 2-part label to the appropriate CRF page

• Investigator Name  
• Drug name (or description) 
• Drug strength  
• Dosage form  
• Quantity per container 
• Instructions for use

• Storage conditions  
35 
v.3.1 January 27, 2017  • Expi[INVESTIGATOR_320] 
• Investigational drug caution statement(s)  
• Subject number 
• Date dispensed (to be written in) 
• Subject initials (to be written in)  
 
Each time study drug is dispensed, study center personnel should write the date the drug is dispensed and the subject initials on both the permanent and detachable labels of the bottle.  The study center should also complete the Drug Inventory Form each time study drug is dispensed.  
8.[ADDRESS_1067547] of the materials that are dispensed and returned (how much, to whom, and when).  This inventory record shall indicate the quantity and description of all study drugs on hand at any time during the course of the study.   
5. At the conclusion or termination of this study, the investigator agrees to conduct a final drug supply inventory, to record the results of this inventory and destroy all remaining study drug on site by [CONTACT_18103]. 
6. The investigator agrees not to supply study drug to any person except study personnel and subjects in this study . 
 
9. DATA ANALYSIS AND STATISTICAL PROCEDURES  
 
9.[ADDRESS_1067548] common subtype presenting in clinical practices.   Superficial BCC and 
infiltrative/morpheaform subtypes have similar presentation rates.   The enrollment method 
provides assurances that that evaluable data will be available for at least 36 subjects across three subtype groups: infiltrative/morpheaform, superficial, and nodular. Refer to Section 9.2 for details on subgroup type assignment.  A sample size of 16 in the nodular group yields a 95% confidence interval of 54%-96% for an observed partial response rate.  The nodular group is 
36 
v.3.1 January 27, 2017  included as part of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], in part, to assess the overall viability of the study.  It is 
important to note that response rate of approximately 75% is anticipated in the nodular group, based on the published literature; the sample size of [ADDRESS_1067549] this level of efficacy.  A sample size of 10 for the infiltrative/morpheaform and superficial BCC groups yields a 95% confidence interval of 10%-70%. Although the confidence intervals are wide, the sample sizes are sufficient to detect a response rate greater the null rate (0%), the expected efficacy level if the treatment had no effect in these histologic subtypes.  
 
9.[ADDRESS_1067550] SUB -GROUP  ASSIGNMENT  
A total of 36 subjects with infiltrative/mor pheaform, nodular, or superficial BCC will be enrolled 
in the study.   For patients with multiple BCC lesions, one “target lesion” will be identified and 
used for subject sub-group assignment for the purposes of enrollment and followed for primary endpoint analysis.  For scientific purposes, data from BCC tumors other than “target lesion” will also be collected.   The lesion(s) biopsied at Screening Visit will be reviewed and each subject 
will be assigned to a subtype group as detailed below and in Figure 5.     Step 1.   Infiltrative/morpheaform subtype lesion will be  
given priority in subject sub-group assignment.   
 Step 2.   If a potential subject does not have a possible target 
lesion that is infiltrative /morpheaform subty pe and has a 
superficial BCC, then  the subject will be assigned to the 
superficial BCC subtype group.    Step 3.   If no infiltrative/morpheaform BCC or superficial 
BCC are identified , then nodular BCC will be eligible for 
enrollment.  
                
Figure 5.  Target Lesion Assignment Algorithm  
If there are two lesions that may be eligible for target lesion assignment  based on histologic 
subtype, then the lesion with larger clinical dimensions will be designated the “target lesion”.  
See Appendix 10, Target Lesion Assignment Examples fo r more information . 
 This “Target Lesion Assignment Algorithm” will continue in this fashion until any two of the subtype groups reaches 26.  This is to ensure that each subgroup has at least [ADDRESS_1067551] 1 BCC of the remaining subtype group.

12.[ADDRESS_1067566] S 
Deviations from a written protocol for individual subjects are inherent to clinical research and can be categorized as either departure from protocol or minor deviations.  A “Departure From Protocol” is a deviation of such magnitude as to affect the evaluability of the subject or to potentially compromise the statistical analysis.  A departure is usually an emergency or other circumstance that requires a decision be made as to whether the subject should be withdrawn from the study.  When a protocol departure or suspected departure occurs; it will be only for that subject.  The investigator will contact [CONTACT_777311].  In the event they are not available, the following emergency number is in operation at all times:

The investigator must complete a “Departure From Protocol” CRF entry for each departure.  
 Minor deviations address procedural issues that do not affect subjects’ adherence to protocol requirements to the extent it could compromise their continued participation in the study, or the results of the study.  Minor deviations observed for a specific subject, or involving several subjects, must be recorded as a comment on the appropriate CRF page(s) for each involved subject.

14.10 APPENDIX 10:  TARGET LESION ASSIGNMENT EXAMPLES  
 
 If a patient has multiple BCC tumors, target lesion assignment will be based on histology using algorithm in Figure 2.  Histology is the primary consideration for “target lesion assignment.”  Histology trumps size.  Size is only considered if there are two lesions that may be eligible for targ et lesion assignment  based 
on histologic subtype.  In this case, the lesion with larger clinical dimensions will be designated the “target lesion”.   
 See Example 1 and Example 2 for more details.

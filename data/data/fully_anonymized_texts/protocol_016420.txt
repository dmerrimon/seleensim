Peer Social Support During In Vivo Exposure for PTSD: A Program to Address Dropout from Prolonged [ADDRESS_43143]-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a significant problem for Veterans and Active Duty personnel. [ADDRESS_43144] (e.g., Prolonged Exposure, PE; Cognitive Processing 23 
Therapy; CPT) and have, at great expense, been widely disseminated by [CONTACT_41285],  over of those 24 
30% who start treatment subsequently drop out p rior to completion . In our first preliminary study we [ADDRESS_43145], and stigma associated with care from mental health settings, and so ov ercame 27 
these barriers by [CONTACT_41286] -based  telehealth. However, dropout remained virtually 28 
unchanged . Veterans in our study who dropped out of treatment, including that delivered via home 29 
based telehealth, were interviewed and a majority responded that they would (a) consider returning to 30 
treatment and (b) would be more likely to complete treatment if a peer who had themselves successfully 31 
completed treatment were available to help them with exposure homework . In keepi[INVESTIGATOR_41244] 32 
feedback , our second preliminary study examined the feasibility of using peers to (a) encourage 33 
Veterans who had dropped out of PE to return to treatment and (b) offer support during in vivo (real 34 
world) exposure therapy homework assignments (e.g., as they would d uring ‘gym workouts’). 35 
Preliminary findings indicate tha t such an approach is feasible, and potentially effective, in that over 36 
50% of dropouts from PE agreed to return to treatment and 30% of these actually did so immediately.  [ADDRESS_43146] successfully competed  PE (i.e., the therapeutic 39 
equivalent of an exposure therapy ‘workout buddy’) is effective in reversing  dropout and improving  40 
PTSD  outcomes; and, secondarily, to determine whether this program is particularly helpful for those 41 
receiving PE via telemedicine.  42

 Page [ADDRESS_43147] successfully competed  PE (i.e., the therapeutic equivalent of an 49 
exposure therapy ‘workout buddy’) is effective in reversing  dropout and improving  PTSD  outcomes. 50 
To achieve this objective, we will use a between  group, randomized controlled repeated measures 51 
design comparing PE+Exposure Workout Buddy  vs. PE+Peer General Support (i.e., the standard VA 52 
Peer Support program methods involving a peer who does NOT engage in any support during in vivo  53 
homework ) to evaluate the ‘PE+Exposure Workout B uddy’ adjunctive therapy component in terms of 54 
its ability to increase likelihood that Veterans will (a) return to  and complete  treatment & (b) evince [ADDRESS_43148] -treatment and 3 - & 6-month fol low-up. An exploratory objective 56 
is to determine whether the hypothesized differential advantage of the workout buddy program is more 57 
pronounced for Veterans who receive PE via telehealth vs . receiving PE in person, as data from 58 
Preliminary Study #1 indica te that this may be the case.  59 
 60 
Objective 1a. To determine relative differences in treatment dose  obtained, measured in terms 61 
of the number of sessions completed upon return to treatment, in response to ‘PE+Exposure 62 
Workout Buddy’ vs. ‘ PE+Peer General Supp ort’ in individuals who have previously dropped out 63 
of evidence based treatment for PTSD.  64 
 65 
Hypothesis 1a.  Treatmen t ‘dose’, measured in terms of number of sessions completed post 66 
randomization, will be greater for participants in the PE+Exposure Workout Buddy condition 67 
compared to PE+Peer General Support .  68 
 69 
Objective 1b. (Exploratory) To determine if differences are a mplified or diminished with respect 70 
to prior identified risk factors such as age, race, gender, substance use, or social support.   71 
 72 
Hypothesis 1b.  This enhanced dose/adherence will be observed for the PE+Exposure  Workout 73 
Buddy condition within each risk factor previously associated with dropout (i.e., age, race, 74 
gender, and substance use).  75 
 76 
Objective 2a. To determine differential effectiveness, measured in terms of therapeutic gains 77 
over time on measures of PTSD s ymptomatology, of ‘PE+Exposure Workout Buddy’ vs. 78 
‘PE+Peer General Support’   with therapy dropouts in (i.e., ‘treatment outcome’).  79 
 80 
Hypothesis 2a.  Treatment ‘outcome’, measured in terms of PTSD symptom reduction scores, 81 
will be significantly more improved for participants in the PE+Exposure Workout Buddy relative 82 
to PE+Peer General Support  condition at each asse ssment point (post treatment, 3 -month and 83 
6-month follow -up). 84 
 85 
Objective 2b.  (Exploratory) To determine if differences are amplified or diminished with respect 86 
to race, gender, age, substance use, or social support.  87 
 88 
Hypothesis 2b.  Relatively greater gains in the PE+Exposure Workout Buddy cond ition will be [ADDRESS_43149] treatment, 3 -month and 6 -month follow - 90 
up. Self reported levels of social support will mediate gains.  91

 Objective 3. (Exploratory) To determine the presence of an initial signal of differential dose and 93 
effectiveness of ‘PE+Exposure Workout Buddy’ when delivered in traditional in person (face to 94 
face) vs. telehealth formats. (Note, the parameters by [CONTACT_41287] [ADDRESS_43150] to randomization because participants who had 96 
received telehealth PE (about half of our clinic population) or in person PE prior to dropout (and thus 97 
prior to this study) will continue to receive treatment in the same  modality upon randomization to either 98 
condition).  [ADDRESS_43151]. Up to 24% of OEF/OIF 104 
Veterans meet criteria for PTSD and 35% report significant PTSD symptoms. These disorders manifest [ADDRESS_43152] trea tments can return personnel to nearly pre - 108

 • Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a significant problem for Veterans  and Active Duty 138 
personnel.  139 
• Effective Treat ments (e.g., Prolonged Exposure, PE; Cognitive Processing Therapy, CPT) exist and [ADDRESS_43154], at great expense, been disseminated by [CONTACT_41288] (VA) and 141 
Defense (DoD).  142 
• Despi[INVESTIGATOR_41246], over 30% of those who are identified, referred, and successfully 143 
access evidence based psychotherapy for PTSD treatment drop out prematurely.  144 
• In a prior DoD study we addressed findings that dropout is related to logistical barriers such as travel [ADDRESS_43155], and stigma associated with care from clinic -based settings by [CONTACT_41289] 146 
home telehealth. However, dropout remained virtually unchanged at 26%.  147 
• In Preliminary Study #1, Veterans who dropped out of treatment, including that delivered  via home [ADDRESS_43156] 149 
had a better likelihood of completing treatment if a peer who had completed treatment were available 150 
to help them with exposure homework. In Preli minary Study #2, 52% of a clinic sample of Veterans 151 
who dropped out of PE indicated that they “would be interested in trying exposure therapy for PTSD 152 
a second time if they could do so with the assistance of an exposure workout buddy.”  153 
• To serve these drop outs from PE therapy, we developed and began initial feasibility testing of the 154 
‘PE+Exposure Workout Buddy ’ program in which Veterans who have recently completed PE and 155 
no longer meet criteria for the disorder meet patients at exposure sites in the communi ty to offer 156 
support during exposure.  157 
• The present study  is to use a randomized controlled repeated measures design to test the 158 
hypotheses that the in vivo ‘exposure workout buddy’ adjunctive component to PE will increase the 159 
likelihood that Veterans who hav e dropped out of PE will (a) return and complete treatment and (b) 160 
evince reduced PTSD symptomatology relative to a general support peer . 161

from treatment. All were male, 27.7% were 175 
Vietnam Veterans, 27.7% Persian Gulf Veterans, 176 
and 44.7% were OEF/OIF Veterans, with no 177 
significant differences in theatre in terms of 178 
treatment medium. Surprisingly, rate of dropout from telehealth (28.7%, n = 35) was not significantly 179 
different from that of in person treatment (25.0%, n = 34) (χ2=0.45, p = 0.30). Forty -seven of the 69 180 
(68.1%) treatment dropouts (27 telehealth; 20 in person) agreed to provide data regarding reasons for 181 
droppi[INVESTIGATOR_26050]. Age ranged from 21 -70 years, and there were no significant differences in 182 
terms of age, education, employment, marital status or baseline symptom severity between conditions.  183

 Results: Considering travel logistics and their relationship to dropout, ANOVA indicated a significant 185 
(and entirely expected) difference between in person and telehealth participants, with in person 186 
participants reporting more problems with bad weather, p arking, transportation, and work/family 187 
obligations (  = 22.5) compared to telehealth (  = 19.6) ( F(1,45) = 5.20, p = 0.027). No other significant 188 
differences were noted for any other factor, including Treatment Demands (in person  = 16.2, vs. 189 
telehealth = 15.6; F(1,45) = 0.34, p = .560); Perceived Relevance of Treatment (in person  = 20.9, 190 
vs. telehealth  = 20.7; F(1,45) = 0.01, p = 0.906), or Relationship with Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] (in person  = 9.1; 191 
telehealth  = 9.0; F(1,45) = 0.04, p = 0.847). However, when Veterans who dropped out of exposure 192 
based treatment were asked specifically about their experiences during imaginal and in vivo exposure 193 
homework, differences between in person and telehealth groups did emerge, and both groups reported 194 
significant difficu lty, particularly with in vivo exposure trials.  Specifically, while only 20% of in person 195 
and 31% of telehealth based treatment dropouts reported they “could not tolerate thinking about the 196 
trauma”, 40% of in person and 58% of telehealth treatment dropouts  reported they “could not tolerate 197 
assignments to go out in public.” Moreover, 20% of in person but 41% of telehealth based Veterans 198 
reported that they “worried about losing control during exposures.” (See graphical illustration of these 199 
data.)  Overall, t hese preliminary data suggest that dropouts had problems with in vivo/situational 200 
exposure homework, and that participants in the telehealth condition who dropped out of treatment 201 
were having more difficulty with specific aspects of exposure therapy compar ed to those receiving 202 
exposure therapy in person.  Along these lines, Hernandez -Tejada, et al (2014) noted that when treating 203 
PTSD in general, and particularly when offering exposure based treatments via telehealth, 204 
interpersonal support offered during expo sure trials by [CONTACT_41290]. Actually, this 205 
“exposure homework workout buddy” idea was not so much our own as it was a direct and repeated 206 
approach suggested by [CONTACT_41291] 207 
regar ding their reasons for doing so. Specifically, when we contact[CONTACT_41292], 208 
approximately 50% indicated that they would have been likely to remain in treatment had they the 209 
support of another Veteran during in vivo exposure homework (see Prel iminary Study #2) . While novel 210 
in its application to PTSD treatment, peer assistance is a technique currently used successfully by [CONTACT_39785] 211 
health and mental health specialties (e.g., cancer : see Meyer et al., 2015; serious mental illness : see 212 
Corrigan et al. , 2014)).  213 
 214 
Preliminary Study #2 : Offering Treatment Dropouts a Chance to Return to PE Treatment with an 215 
Exposure Therapy Workout Buddy: Feasibility of Recruitment of Patients and Peers  216 
 217 
The Veterans’ suggestion to combine the beneficial aspects of social support with the effectiveness of 218 
exposure based treatments for PTSD (e.g., one Veteran described it as ‘the best of supportive group [ADDRESS_43158] of PTSD treatment’) represen ted no less than a “Eureka” moment for our [ADDRESS_43159] effective manner, the treatment retention issue confronting patients of VA and 222 
DoD. Indeed , variations on this theme are evident in-group  delivery of exposure therapy for PTSD (see 223 
Smith, Porter, Messina, Beyer, Defever, Foa, & Rauch, 2015). Our approach to leveraging peer support 224 
is directly in line with the recent VA/DoD implementation of “Pe er Support Programs” (Money et al., 225 
2011) across the country. We predict that this support will help to address dropout associated with 226 
exposure therapy, particularly when delivered via telehealth, an increasingly prevalent modality in 227 
VA/DoD.  [ADDRESS_43160] thi s end, we developed the ‘ PE+Exposure Workout Buddy’  program, explained at length in the 230 
Treatments  section below. It is important to note that Veterans serving as ‘workout buddies’ are not 231

 replacing therapi[INVESTIGATOR_41247]; rather they are simply providing support and encouragement 232 
akin to that derived from others during group psychotherapy, such as during group delivered PE (Smith 233 
et al., 2015). PE Workout buddies are Veterans who have completed PE and no longer meet criteria [ADDRESS_43161] volunteered to meet Veterans engaged in PE (in this case, Veterans [ADDRESS_43162] dropped out of PE, but returned at the offer of a PE workout buddy) at their situational 236 
exposure homework site to offer encouragement and support in addressing a previou sly discussed and 237 
agreed upon exposure hierarchy item. Our preliminary qualitative interviews with Veterans in this 238 
program indicate that this enhances PE treatment in two ways: first, Veterans appear more likely to 239 
attempt  in vivo exercises if they know a  fellow Veteran is waiting at the site of their exposure homework 240 
(i.e., when they ‘don’t feel like’ doing the exposure homework, they are nonetheless more likely to leave [ADDRESS_43163] to Wal -Mart for the exposure assignment if they know the Worko ut Buddy is there 242 
waiting). Second, they are more likely to complete  the exposure homework item if they have the 243 
encouragement and support of another Veteran during the process.  244 
 245 
For this preliminary feasibility study, we re -contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] 82 Veterans who had dropped out of exposure 246 
based treatment for PTSD (either from two ongoing treatment outcome studies or from VA PTSD clinic 247 
services) and offered them the opportunity to attempt PE again, this time with the assistance of an 248 
‘exposure therapy workout buddy’. We also asked clinicians to contact [CONTACT_41293] 249 
completed treatment and no longer met criteria for PTSD who might be interested in serving as a PE 250 
Workout Buddy.  251 
 252 
Feasibility Results : Fully 52% (n=43) of  the 82 dropouts indicated that they “would be interested in 253 
trying exposure therapy for PTSD a second time if they could do so with the assistance of an exposure 254 
workout buddy,”  and 30% (13) of these immediately  completed informed consent to re -initate tr eatment. 255 
Given the strong support from Veterans who had dropped o ut of treatment for the  peer support solution, 256 
we next attempted to identify peers who might be good candidates to serve in this capacity (e.g., offer 257 
to meet patients at in vivo homework locations to offer support and encouragement). Thirteen potential 258 
exposure therapy workout buddi es were contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], 85% (11) agreed to enroll in the program as a [ADDRESS_43164], and meeting peers in the 268 
community to complete in vivo exposure therapy assignments. We polled participants (both those who 269 
had completed the PE+Workout Buddy program, and those who were in the midst of treatment) as to 270 
their satisfaction and general experiences. 100% reported that they were either “very satisfied” or 271 
“extremely satisfied with the program. All participants reported that they would strongly recommend the 272 
program to a friend. 100% of participants agreed with the statement that “the peer was dependable,” 273 
and 100% indicated in the affirmative to the statement  “the peer addressed important issues in their 274 
health care.” Zero adverse events were reported, by [CONTACT_1962], peers, or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437]. Thus, the feasibility [ADDRESS_43165] importantly, patient willingness to  return to 278 
treatment (52%), overall appears very strongly supported . 279

help the latter com plete exposure homework assignments 291 
to determine if this pairing affects the following 2 primary 292 
endpoints: (1) treatment dose/completion  and (2) treatment 293 
outcome . Exploratory aims are to determine if the program 294 
results in (3) differential treatment completion and 295 
outcomes for telehealth vs . in person -delivered PE 296 
treatment, as preliminary data indicate that the exposure 297

treatment delivery format of increasing prevalence in VA 300 
and DoD settings. See Logic Model Diagram for study 301

community exposure assignment sites such as the parking lot of Wal -Mart, & accompanying them [ADDRESS_43169] with Veterans, and  meet with them informally in person when Veterans arrive for 310 
their appointments.  They  will remind and encourage participants to attend appointments, check up on 311

1. Clinician Administered PTSD Scale -5 (CAPS -5; Weathers et al., 2013): PTSD diagnoses will be [ADDRESS_43181] of symptoms on 388 
socia l and occupational functioni ng and improvement in symptoms.  389 
2. Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview 7.0  (MINI 7.0): The MINI is a standardized 390 
structured interview used to assess psychiatric diagnoses according to the DSM -5. The MINI is 391 
similar in sensitivity, specificity, and  inter-rater reliability to more lengthy diagnostic interviews, 392 
such as the SCID (Sheehan et al., 1998). Major Depression, Panic, and Substance Dependence [ADDRESS_43182] -5 (PCL -5; Blevins, Weather s et al., 2015):   The PCL -[ADDRESS_43183] commonly used self report measures of PTSD symptoms and intensity. 396 
The PCL -5 is structured to correspond to the DSM -5 PTSD criteria. The 20 -items are scored on 397 
a 0-4 Likert scale for e ach symptom corresponding to “Not at all” to “Extremely”. Total scores 398 
range from 0 to 80 . Initial psychometric data are encouraging. With college student samples, 399 
Blevin et al found PCL -5 scores exhibited strong internal consistency (α = .94), test -retest  400 
reliability ( r = .82), and convergent ( rs = .74 to .85) and discriminant ( rs = .31 to .60) validity. With 401 
Veteran samples, Bovin et al (2015) found that the PCL -5 had good internal consistency (α =.96) [ADDRESS_43184] reliability (r = .84). Moreover, signal detection analyses using CAPS -5 indicated 403 
a cutoff score of 31 -33 on the PCL -5 optimally categorized PTSD diagnosis.  404 
4. Selected scales of the Deployment Risk and Resiliency Inventory  (DRRI; King, King, & Vogt, 405 
2003). The DRRI is collection of self -report measures assessing 14 key deployment -related risk 406 
and resilience factors with demonstrated implications for Veterans' long -term health.  407 
5. Patient Health Questionnaire -9 (PHQ -9; Kroenke, Spi[INVESTIGATOR_626], & Williams, 2001): The Patient Health 408 
Questionnaire -9 is widely used, well -validated measure of depression severity with high internal 409 
consistency (alpha .83 to .92; Cameron, Crawford, et al, 2008), and is correlated strongly with 410 
other depression measures (Kroenke et al., 2001). Its 9 items assess affective and somatic 411 
symptoms and correspond to diagnostic criteria for MDD.  412

respondents’ level of functioning in seven life domains:  romantic relationship, relationship with [ADDRESS_43186] 30 426 
days in each area on a 7 -point scale ranging from “0 = Not at all” to “6 = Very much.”  [ADDRESS_43187] modification variables in proposed 430 
analyses, we will assess the level of combat exposure of participants at baseline using the Combat 431 
Exposure Scale  (CES; Keane, Fairbank, Caddell, Zimering, Taylor, & Mora, 1989) because comba t [ADDRESS_43188] studies, including our own (see Price, 433 
Gros, Strachan, Ruggiero, & Acierno, 2013). The CES is a 7 -item self -report measure that assesses 434 
wartime stressors experienced by [CONTACT_41294]. Items are rated on a 5 -point frequency (1 = no or never 435 
to 5 = more than 50 times), 5 -point duration (1 = never to 5 = more than 6 months), 4 -point frequency 436 
(1 = no to 4 = more than 12 times) or 4 -point degree of loss (1 = no one to 4 = more than 50%) scale. 437 
Respondents are asked to respond based on their exposure to various combat situations, such as firing 438 
rounds at the enemy and being on dangerous duty. The total CES score (ranging from 0 to 41) is 439 
calculated by [CONTACT_2329] a sum of weighted scores, which can be cl assified into 1 of 5 categories of combat 440 
exposure ranging from "light" to "heavy."   Futher,  we will administer the Alcohol Use Disorders [ADDRESS_43189]  (AUDIT; Saunders et al., 1993), a [ADDRESS_43190]  (DAST -10; Skinner, 444

 the clinical cutoff posted by [CONTACT_41295] 33 obtained in two consecutive 463 
PCL-5 scores. A treatment completer will be defined as completing 10 or more sessions; or when [ADDRESS_43195] these gains . The overall limit to number of sessions in either group will be 15 (so 466 
as to prevent outliers in session frequency affecting ‘dose’ between group analyses). It is [ADDRESS_43196] patient s will occasionally miss a session or fail to complete their homework 468 
assignments . These will not be considered dropouts; patients will be allowed to make -up 469 
sessions as long as they re -enter treatment within a 4 week period. Patients who miss all 4- 470 
treatm ent sessions during a 4 -week period will be considered dropouts (i.e., if a patient, during [ADDRESS_43197] session completed, they 472 
will be considered a dropout). Note MEASUREMENT ISSUE: participants w ho completed a 473 
greater number of sessions prior to original dropout may be expected to achieve clinical outcome 474 
goals in fewer sessions than those completing one or two sessions prior to dropout. Hence, the 475 
‘dose’ variable of Aim 1a and b, measured in term s of overall number of new sessions, is 476 
confounded by ‘prior dose’, or the number of treatment sessions received prior to study initiation. [ADDRESS_43198] 10 sessions or achieving 479

2. Treatment Credibility  (Peers after 1st patient experience; Participants prior to session 2 ) To 482 
assess differences in outcome expectancy, treatment credibility scales developed by [CONTACT_41297] 483 
and Nau (1972) will be used. Four of the questions will be used for this study, with 10 -point Likert 484 
scales. These include questi ons regarding how logical treatment seems, how confident they are 485 
about treatment, and expectations of success .  486 
3. Treatment Adherence  Treatments in both groups will require patients to carry out “homework 487 
assignments.” These forms will be collected and moni tored each week during treatment. The 488 
percentage of returned, completed forms will be computed as an indicator of adherence to 489 
homework assignments .  490 
4. Modified Charleston Psychiatric Outpatient Satisfaction Scale  (CPOSS -VA; Frueh et al., 2002):  491 
(Patient , following their last treatment session ) Patient satisfaction is an important treatment 492 
outcome variable, closely associated with clinical outcomes (Druss et al., 1999). This measure 493 
also asks about specific components of the workout buddy program (e.g., the quality of 494 
communication, ease of use, willingness to use treatment) in order to allow in depth analysis of 495 
potential causes of differences in workout buddy effectiveness for in person vs. telehealth 496 
delivered PE (AIM 3). The CPOSS -VA is 16 -item measure, with a Likert scale response format, 497 
based on a general measure of patient satisfaction (Pellegrin et al., 2001). In a sample of 498 
Veterans preliminary data showed excellent reliability (alpha = .96) and good convergent validity 499 
with anchors (Frueh  et al., 2002).  500

7.1.4. Recruitment Process . The Ralph H. Johnson Veterans Affairs Medical Center (RHJ VAMC)  [ADDRESS_43208] to offer this 573 
treatme nt via telehealth and via home based telehealth. As such, all RHJ VAMC Mental Health Clinic 574 
staff are cross trained in research referral to study staff for all potential participants, and research staff 575 
are housed alongside clinic staff . More relevant to t he present application, as there are a large number 576 
of providers conducting PE in both clinic and research treatment settings (19 current full time PE 577 
providers each providing both in person and home based telehealth PE), the number of PE dropouts 578 
meeting inclusion criteria and available for recruitment to this study is quite large (our current roster of [ADDRESS_43209] 6 months is over 250, representing about 30% of cases).  [ADDRESS_43210] obtained (for our PE+ Exposure  Workout Buddy pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]) and currently maintain Institutional [ADDRESS_43211] (IRB) and Veterans Affairs Research and Development (VA RD) approval for clinical [ADDRESS_43212] dropped out of PE with an invitation to particip ate in 584

 591 
Related to the question of whether or not participants meeting inclusion criteria are available, is whether 592 
those available participants will actually agree to return to treatment. Our pi[INVESTIGATOR_9958], described 593 
above, indicate that 52% of those who have dropped out of PE agree to return with the assistance of 594 
an exposure workout buddy, and 30% of these sign consents to do so immediately . The willingness of 595 
Veteran PE dropouts to consider returning to tr eatment upon hearing of the workout buddy program 596 
was extremely encouraging.  597

but will be blinded to condition.  724 
 725 
1. Experimental Condition: PE+Exposure Workout Buddy . The experimental treatment is a 726 
modified version of PE insofar as social support in the form of ‘workout buddies’ for in vivo 727 
exposure homework is added to the protocol. Specifically, PE is a manualized tr eatment (Foa et 728 
al., 2007) that includes the following components: (a) psychological education about the 729 
common reactions to traumatic events and presentation of the treatment rationale (sessions 1 730 
and 2), (b) repeated  in vivo  exposure to trauma -related st imuli such as people, places, things, 731 
or situations that trigger memories of the traumatic event but are realistically safe (in vivo 732 
exercises are assigned as homework during sessions 3 through 11), (c) repeated, prolonged, 733 
imaginal exposure to traumatic m emories (imaginal exposure is implemented during sessions 3 734 
- 11; patients listen to session audiotapes for homework between sessions), and (d) relapse 735 
prevention strategies and further treatment planning (session 12).  736 
 737 
PE is based on emotional processing  theory, which suggests that traumatic events are 738 
incompletely and inaccurately encoded in memory as “fear networks.” Gradual exposure to 739 
corrective information via the confrontation of (i.e., exposure to) conditioned trauma -related 740 
stimuli within a safe a nd therapeutic environment results in a competing and antithetical memory 741 
structure that inhibits the conditioned fear response. PE relies on two primary therapeutic tools: 742 
in vivo exposure and imaginal exposure. During in vivo exposure, the patient confro nts feared, 743 
but safe, stimuli or cues that elicit trauma -related distress. During imaginal exposure, patients 744 
are guided by [CONTACT_2111][INVESTIGATOR_41259] “revisit” the traumatic event, providing a detailed verbal account [ADDRESS_43236] decided to drop out / have 750

description of peer and training below) who has been through treatment successfully, and no 752

workout buddy,’ by [CONTACT_41303].  [ADDRESS_43237] indicated that they will be available for this study . We will use 757 
identical methods to recruit and train peer exposure workout buddies as prove d feasible in the 758

the primar y focus of training. Much time is spent emphasizing appropriate rule s of confidentiality, 781 
self-disclos ure (which is instructed to be limited), boundaries and safety procedures. As [ADDRESS_43241] been very helpful: that of peer and participants a s ‘workout buddies’ [ADDRESS_43242] or providing therapy; rather, their role is equivalent to 790 
that of a supportive group member in traditional group counseling (with which many Veterans  791 
are familiar), only this support is given in the context of exposure exercises. In such a situation, 792 
group members offer each other advice and support on how to achieve stated goals. In the 793 
present case, the stated and agreed upon goal will be the in vivo  exposure therapy assignment. 794 
As with group counseling members, peers are trained in the importance of confidentiality, and 795 
are not paid or compensated for their time (they are reimbursed for fuel). This clarifies that they [ADDRESS_43243] had such a high Peer volunteer rate 798 
(85% of those approached) (see Preliminary Study #2). Limits to personal r esponsibility will be 799 
clearly outlined, and peers will be well educated that neither the outcome of the treatment, nor 800 
the disposition of the patient is their responsibility. We will review potential negative outcomes, 801 
including patient suicide, and apply the limits of personal peer responsibility to each. Moreover, 802 
we will make it explicitly clear that exactly and only those roles and responsibilities found in group 803

the program is built in from the beginning. Workout buddies will focus on  helpi[INVESTIGATOR_41267] 897 
engage in those exposure exercises that typi[INVESTIGATOR_41268]. Again, any exposure trials, 898 
such as driving, that require the participant to engage alone, or from which workout buddies are 899 
specifically prohibited will not be t he target of this program.  900

2. Control Condition: PE+Peer General  Peer Support . Participants in this condition will receive PE 902 
(see above) and be assigned  a peer  support volunteer  who will NOT engage in any support [ADDRESS_43254] VA PTSD peer support procedures. Therefore, in this conditions peers  provide general 905 
support, such as remind ing and encour aging  participants to attend appointments,  meeting with 906 
them at the VA 2 -4 times per month to assess general progress,  check ing up on them once per 907 
week via telephone and ask ing about current treatment progress, life stresses, opportunities, 908 
problems and successes, and offer ing general support with VA programs . The PE component 909 
of this  treatment will be matched to experimental condition in terms of session number and 910 
duration (12  sessions); treatment completion will be defined as for the experimental condition 911 
(minimum 10 sessions or pre-specified reductions in PCL score at two consecutive sessions; 912 
see above). Counselors will deliver treatment according to the same schedule as th e 913 
experimental condition, once weekly for 75 -90 minutes.  914 
 915 
Treatment Providers  Training, and Supervision . Treatment providers for both conditions  will be master’s [ADDRESS_43255] already engaged in 919 
training through the prio r PE studies and workout buddy pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. However, for new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437], 920 
providers will undergo a 4 -day PE workshop and a 4 hour PE+Exposure Workout Buddy Training with [ADDRESS_43256] with protocols as written, all 927 
sessions will be audiotaped, and 20% of these will be randomly selected and rated for competence and [ADDRESS_43257] appropriately c overed the content of each session (i.e., demonstrated the 933 
particular behavior described in each item). To evaluate competence , rating forms were developed to [ADDRESS_43258] rating forms used in 936 
other studies of cognitive -behavioral treatments, including our own treatment outcome studies.  937

 Treatment integrity can also be challenged by [CONTACT_41306] -study treatments. That is, 939 
participants may seek additional treatment on their own during follow -up data collection periods. This 940 
is particularly a problem if one treatment does not “work” and participants naturally look elsewhere for [ADDRESS_43259] obtained additional mental 943 
health treatment. Participants who do receive additional treatmen t will be compared to others within 944 
their treatment conditions that do not receive such additional intervention. Any differences noted will 945 
result in relevant adjustments to data analytic procedures (e.g., reporting data summaries of individuals 946 
receiving other treatment).  [ADDRESS_43260] already dropped out of PE treatment once and 949 
may arguably be more likely to do so again in the future, this study has been powered to offset a 950 
projected 35% dropout rate during trea tment, and a 10 -15% loss to follow -up during the [ADDRESS_43261] -Military Version (PCL -5) scores below 20 (note, the National Center for PTSD su ggested 953 
cutoff is 33 (Weathers et al., 2013) ) will be considered completers. Participants will be allowed to make - 954 
up sessions when appropriate or necessary within a 4 -week window. Make -up sessions for subjects in 955 
both conditions will be handled in the same  manner: when feasible, these sessions will be scheduled [ADDRESS_43262] treatment, and 3, 6 -month follow -up assessments (but not treatment 958 
sessions). Additionally, following the informed consent process, we will request additional contact 959 
information (two family members and/or friends) who would know how to get in touch with the participant 960 
if we are unable t o do so with his/her primary contact [CONTACT_6227].  We will also specifically ask for e -mail [ADDRESS_43263] information. This information will be updated at each assessment time point. 962 
We also will employ the following strategies to maintain study partici pation: 1) We will stress the [ADDRESS_43264] session and educate patients regarding the treatment process, 964 
treatment participation, and (for the experimental group) partnering with a workout buddy for exposure 965 
trials; 2) Study pe rsonnel will send letters ahead of telephone and/or e -mail scheduling contacts and 966 
make reminder telephone calls to participants on the day or evening prior to each session; 3) Study 967 
personnel will coordinate care, as needed, with participant’s case manage rs, psychiatrists, social [ADDRESS_43265] acted as referral agents for the study; 4) Study personnel 969 
will be flexible in accommodating participant schedules for treatment sessions; and 5) Project staff will 970 
meet weekly to review scheduling activities and problem solve regarding strategies and approaches 971 
that may increase successful follow -up and retention.  972

The study assessments will be administered online through the Charleston VA’s academic affiliate, 1008  
Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC)  REDCap ™ (Research Electronic Data Capture) software. 1009  
REDCap ™ is a software toolset and workflow methodology for electronic collection and management 1010  
of research clinical trial data.  It provides secure, web -based flexible applications, including real time  1011  
validation rules with automated data type and range checks at the time of entry.  The underlying 1012  
database is hosted in a secure data center at MUSC, a secure environment for data systems and 1013  
servers on campus, and includes redundancy, failover capability,  backups and extensive security 1014  
checks.  The system has several layers of protection including user/group account management, “Data 1015  
Access Groups” which allow data to be entered by [CONTACT_41307] 1016  
user rights for entered data , audit trails for all changes, queries and reports, and Secure Sockets Layer 1017

Protection of Patient Confidentiality/Disposition of Data . Prot ection of participant confidentiality is an [ADDRESS_43271] used with similar previous studies: The investigators and the research team  will 1047  
sign a confidentiality agreement with the Charleston VAMC that no identifying information of specific 1048  
individuals will appear in any internal reports prepared for th e VA or external documents (e.g., peer - 1049  
reviewed publications, presentations). All study data related to psychological outcomes (i.e., the 1050  
participant responses to questionnaires) and demographics will not have any unique identifying data [ADDRESS_43272]. There will be no linkage between a volunteer’s identity and their [ADDRESS_43273] of participants (again, not linked to any participant responses) will remain [ADDRESS_43274] for an added measure of protection . All data will be stored in locked files or on encrypted 1055

the non -randomized, exploratory conditions (in person vs. telehealth delivered PE+ Exposure  Workout 1109  
Buddy vs. PE+Peer General Support ). These analyses will identify potential confounding variables to 1110  
be used as covariates in subsequent analyses and will include race/ethnicity, age, psychiatric 1111  
comorbidity,  and initial disease severity.  To investigate potential limits on generalizability, we will 1112  
compare characteristics of participants who prematurely exit and/or are protocol non -adherent (i.e., 1113  
they dropped out again) against those who were comp leters/protocol adherent . Characteristics of 1114

 Objective 1a : To determine the differential impact on treatment dose received of ‘PE+Exposure 1118  
Workout B uddy’ vs. ‘ PE+Peer General Support ’ in individuals who have dropped out of evidence based [ADDRESS_43283] to prior identified risk factors such as age, race, gender, or substance use.  1122  
 1123  
Analysis Issues for Objective 1 : As mentioned in the Measures section, ‘dose’, or number of new 1124  
sessions received is likely confounded by ‘prior dose’, or number of pre -dropout sessions 1125  
received prior to initiation of this study. Nonetheless, the basic question of treatment dose as 1126  
measured by [CONTACT_41310] 1127  
import ant and will be obtained. However, to deal with this potential confound, (a) number of 1128  
sessions completed prior to dropout will serve as a covariate in subsequent analyses & (b) ‘dose’ 1129  
will also be examined dichotomously, in terms of between group proporti ons of treatment 1130  
completers (defined as completing 10 or more new sessions OR 2 subsequent PCL5 scores 1131  
below 33) .  1132  
 1133  
Analysis Plan for Objective 1 : We will adopt a relatively direct analytic approach for this first 1134  
objective. Specifically, if preliminary de scriptive analyses reveal baseline differences in 1135  
psychopathology or other potentially confounding variables, including number of sessions 1136  
completed prior to dropout (i.e., prior to entry into this study) these will serve as covariates in [ADDRESS_43284] approach will be taken for the dichotomous 1141  
variable of treatment completion, for which we will initially use chi square analyses for bivariate 1142  
examination of treatment completion in terms of each demographic  variable and each treatment 1143  
condition, followed by [CONTACT_41311] 1144  
square relationships to this outcome will be included in regression models. We will use 95% 1145  
confidence intervals (CI) for single prop ortions to estimate the proportion of participants who 1146  
complete treatment within  each intervention group. We will also estimate the difference in 1147  
completer proportions between groups using 95% CI for difference in proportions . In addition, 1148  
frequency distributions describing participants' reasons for discontinuation of study participation [ADDRESS_43285] of each treatment condition on ‘dose’, measured in [ADDRESS_43286] 10 sessions / achieving clinical cutoff will be described.  1152  
 1153  
Objective 2a . To determine differential effectiveness of ‘PE +Exposure Workout Buddy’ vs. ‘PE+Peer 1154  
General Support ’ who does NOT engage  in any support during in vivo homework  with therapy dropouts 1155  
in terms of therapeutic gains over time on measures of PTSD symptomatology (i.e., ‘treatment 1156  
outcome’). Objective 2b . To determine if differential effectiveness is amplified or diminished with r espect [ADDRESS_43287] of all participants who are randomized to either PE+Exposure Workout Buddy 1161  
or PE+Peer General Support . Patients will not be discontinued from the study assessments 1162  
becaus e of non -adherence and all patients will remain in the study assessment protocol unless 1163

 Page 27 of 36 
 consent is withdrawn or there are concerns regarding patient safety. We will adopt several 1164  
approaches to dealing with missing data for the intent -to-treat analysis set:   for continuous 1165  
outcomes, we will employ mixed effects models (GLMM, MEM) which allow for measurement of 1166  
subjects at different time points and missing data (Hedeker & Gibbons, 2006);  for single endpoint 1167  
imputation, we will use the multiple imputation meth ods of Little and Rubin (1987) . We will model 1168  
the dichotomous outcome, missing/not missing post treatment score, using logistic regression 1169  
to determine if missingness is related to treatment condition. In a secondary analysis, the results 1170  
of analyses using  treatment completers (completer analyses) will be compared with results using 1171  
the full set of all randomized participants (ITT analyses) to test sensitivity of study conclusions 1172  
to dropouts .  1173  
 1174  
To address possible Type I errors due to the number of analyse s: (1) for the primary analyses, 1175  
we specify a priori  the primary measures corresponding to the stated a priori hypotheses (with 1176  
other measures being considered secondary/exploratory) and maintain the significance level 1177  
(alpha) at 0.05 for analyses involvin g the primary study variables; and (2) for secondary analyses [ADDRESS_43288] p -values 1179  
using a Bonferroni -type correction for multiple outcomes and will report both unadjusted and 1180  
adjusted p -values. Secondary outcomes and exploratory analyses will be evaluated qualitatively 1181  
in terms of consistency with primary results and cautiously in terms of statistical significance of 1182  
results . The sensitivity of the study results to adjustment for multiplic ity of outcomes will be 1183  
evaluated.  1184  
 1185  
Analysis Plan for Objective 2 . Our primary outcome is the PCL5 continuous score for PTSD. 1186  
Clinical (CAPS, PCL -5, Patient Health Questionnaire), functional (SF -36), and process 1187  
(treatment credibility scales, patient satis faction, session rating scale, service delivery 1188  
perceptions, retention in treatment) outcomes will be compared using the generalized linear 1189  
mixed models (GLMM) approach . In addition to accommodating a wide range of distributional 1190  
assumptions [continuous (e .g., PCL -5, CAPS, Patient Health Questionnaire), 1191  
dichotomous/categorical (e.g., binomial),  ordinal (e.g. patient ratings), count (e.g., number of 1192  
missed homework assignments (Poisson), the approach accommodates multilevel data 1193  
(clustering) such as repeated  measurements of subjects, missing data, time -varying covariates, 1194  
and possible cluster effects within sites or clinics through inclusion of random effects in the model 1195  
(Hedeker & Gibbons, 2006) . For the continuous outcomes, for example PCL5, GLMM is [ADDRESS_43289] model (MEM) approach . MEM analyses estimate individual [ADDRESS_43290] squares means for continuous outcomes will be 1201  
compared at relevant time points (e.g., immediate post  end-of-active -intervention and 6 -month 1202  
end-of-study time points) using appropriate model contrasts and the Tukey -Kramer adjustment [ADDRESS_43291] assess trends in the outcome profiles over the full study 1204  
period (active + follow -up). In these analyses, we will allow slopes to differ depending upon 1205  
whether it is active or follow -up phase . In secondary analyses, we will also assess separately 1206  
the active phase and the follow -up phase (3 - & 6-months) trajectories to remove from the active 1207  
phase results the complicating issue of intervening events in the follow -up phase. Intervention 1208  
specific patient satisfaction items will be described separately within each intervention group 1209

 Page [ADDRESS_43292] de scriptive analyses (e.g., means, proportions along with corresponding 1210  
confidence intervals). Global satisfaction level (e.g., overall satisfaction level) will be compared [ADDRESS_43293] sizes . The magnitude of treatment group differences (effect sizes) for 1215  
outcome variables will be estimated using 95% confidence intervals (CI) . Effect sizes will be 1216  
used to evaluate clinical significance of treatment group comparisons.  1217  
 1218  
Exploratory Objective 3 . To determine the presence of initial signals of differential dose and 1219  
effectiveness of  ‘PE+Exposure  Workout Buddy’ when delivered in traditional in person (face to face) 1220  
vs. telehealth formats . (Note, the parameters by [CONTACT_41312] [ADDRESS_43294] to randomization because participants who  had received telehealth 1222  
or in person PE prior to dropout and thus prior to this study will continue to receive treatment in the 1223  
same modality upon randomization to either PE+Exposure Workout Buddy or PE+Peer General 1224  
Support ). [ADDRESS_43295] of the PE+Exposure Workout Buddy program for those [ADDRESS_43296] to ‘dose’ 1229  
and ‘% completing treatment’, and Objective [ADDRESS_43297] to clinical outcomes. As such, the 1230  
logistic regression analyses conducted for Objective 1 will be repeated, this time including 1231  
treatment delivery medium (in person vs. telehealth) as an independent predictor variable. [ADDRESS_43298], the 1234  
hypothesized advantage of the PE +Exposure Workout Buddy program for telehealth will receive [ADDRESS_43299] of the process variables on clinical outcom es. These 1239  
analyses address the question of whether process outcomes such as satisfaction with the 1240  
intervention, treatment credibility, and session attendance explain the relationship between the 1241  
outcome variable (PTSD severity) and intervention group (prim ary independent variable). For 1242  
example, these analyses will explore whether a more positive outcome in one group may be 1243  
explained by [CONTACT_41313], or as 1244  
hypothesized here, social support. Specific ally, in mediator analyses, it is posited that variation 1245  
in the primary independent variable (intervention group) accounts for variation in the mediators 1246  
(e.g., social support, session attendance), and variations in the mediators account for variations 1247  
in outcome (PTSD severity) . For these analyses, we will use the GLMM modeling approach 1248  
described above coupled with the method of Baron and Kenney (1986) and Holmbeck (1997) [ADDRESS_43300], Charleston, SC [ZIP_CODE] or an 1253

outlined in the informed consent documents.  1316  
 1317  
Risk Management and Emergency Response . In the event respondents experience extreme 1318  
psychological distress secondary to partici pation, they will be encouraged to telephone the Principal 1319  
Investigator (PI) or the Co -Investigators. In addition, they will have access to the VA’s urgent care [ADDRESS_43312] Co -Is, who will then report these serious adverse effects in writing to the University/VA [ADDRESS_43313] experienced significant life 1325

symptoms of anxiety and depression, as well as the cognitive realization that, through their volunteer 1359  
efforts, they are helpi[INVESTIGATOR_41271] 1360

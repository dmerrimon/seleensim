STUDY SCHEMA  
 
Purpose:  
 To assess the effect  of the PROCEED Prior Cesarean 
Decision Support app (versus usual care without the app) 
on rates of trial of labor after cesarean (TOLAC) among 
pregnant women with a prior cesarean delivery  (CD) . 
Design:  
 This is a two -armed randomized controlled trial (R CT) 
among 1,320 English - or Spanish -speaking pregnant 
women (1:1 randomization sequence for the 
intervention).   
Study 
Population:  
 Pregnant women receiving prenatal care at a 
participating healthcare facility. Women will be eligible to 
enroll if they mee t all of the following criteria.  
Inclusion criteria:  
• Between 12  weeks 0 days and 24 weeks 6 days 
gestation at enrollment  
• Speak English or Spanish  
• Have had one  and only one prior CD 
• Prior low transverse cesarean  
• Unknown scar but TOLAC eligible  
 
Exclusion criteria:  
• No prior cesarean delivery , or more than one   
• Multiple gestation pregnancy  
• Prior vaginal birth after cesarean  
• Any contraindications to TOLAC   (prior classical 
cesarean, prior uterine surgery, T -incisions, other 
contraindication)  
• Delivering at outside institution  
 
Study Size:  
 The recruitment goal is 1,320 participants, for a 
recruitment rate of 40 participants per month and a final 
subset of 627 per arm (1254) projecting 5% loss to follow 
up.     
Study 
Intervention:  
 Participan ts in the intervention arm will be provided with  
the PROCEED Prior Cesarean Decision app, which includes 
approximately 15 minutes of dynamic web -based 
informational content including potential maternal and 
neonatal complications from vaginal and cesarean 
deliveries, values clarification questions, and 
individualized estimates of likelihood of successful 
TOLAC.   
Study 
Duration:  
 Data collection start date: January 2016  
Estimated data collection end date:  July 2019   
 
 
Primary 
Hypothesis:  
 Compared to women who receive usual care only, women 
who are randomized to use the Prior Cesarean Decision 
app will be more likely to undergo TOLAC.  
Secondary 
Hypotheses:  
 Compared  to women who receive usual care only, 
women randomized to use the Prior Cesarean Decision 
app will:  
1. be more likely to have a vaginal birth after cesarean 
(major secondary outcome)  
2. be more knowledgeable about TOLAC and elective 
repeat cesarean delivery (ERCD) and their potential 
outcomes  
3. experience less decisional conflict  
4. report higher levels of shared decision making 
regardin g delivery approach  
5. report higher levels of decision self- efficacy   
6. report higher levels of decision satisfaction  
7. experience lower rates of maternal and neonatal 
morbidities

[LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_871264]………………           - 9- [ADDRESS_1216807] of cesarean rate in the US.  Cesarean delivery (CD) is the most common 
inpatient surgery in the US, accounting for nearly one third of births annually. In the last decade, 
the CD rate has increased by [CONTACT_3450] 50%, with almost 1.3 million procedures performed 
in 2012.1 Moreover, at $7.[ADDRESS_1216808] been associated with an increase in 
major maternal morbidity,3–5 with corresponding increases in length of inpatient care following 
delivery and frequency of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_61715].6 Organizations including Healthy People7, the 
American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)8, and the American College of 
Nurse Midwives9 have targeted reducing the CD rate as an important public health goal for more 
than a decade; however, identifying interventions to achieve this goal has pro ven challenging.  
Causes and consequences of the rising rate of repeat cesareans. Repeat CDs are a significant 
contributor to the increased cesarean rate, resulting from the combination of a rising rate of 
primary CD and a decreasing rate of vaginal birth after cesarean, which declined from a high of 
28.3% in [ZIP_CODE] to 9.2% in 2010.[ADDRESS_1216809] been posited as contributing 
to this decline, including the decreasing number of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_871265]. In addition, a substantial 
portion of the decrease is related to women foregoing trial of labor after cesarean (TOLAC) even 
though their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_871266]. For example, among hospi[INVESTIGATOR_871267]- Fetal Medicine Units network, TOLAC rates declined from 51.8% to 
29.8% (p<.001) from 1999- 2002, even though TOLAC continued to be offered at all sites.11 In a 
study of “good TOLAC candidates” at a 14 -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_871268], the 
average TOLAC rate was only 30%.12 And at Northwestern, one of the clinical sites for our study,

(N = 660)  
TOLAC rates decreased by [CONTACT_1192] -thirds from 1995 to 2010 although all providers offer this labor 
approach.  
Importantly, the declining VBAC rate is not primarily due to new and more concerning 
information about the risks of TOLAC; recent epi[INVESTIGATOR_871269] -level outcomes of TOLAC, such as the chance of VBAC or of uterine rupture if a 
TOLAC is attempted, are no  different today than they were three decades ago.2,13 –15  Similarly, 
this decline is not primarily due to changes in characteristics  of the population that would make 
VBAC less likely if TOLAC is undertaken; these decreases in TOLAC have affected all women, 
regardless of their probability of VBAC or risks of adverse TOLAC outcomes.11 The extent t o 
which these changes are 
driven by [CONTACT_871291]. Data from 
qualitative studies offer 
some insight, but the 
value of that information 
is limited by [CONTACT_11339] -
generalizability of the 
study populations and 
the lack of quantitative 
analyses.16–21 
Furthermore, while 
decreased TOLAC rates 
are occurring throughout 
the US, there are 
persistent, unexplained 
racial/ethnic, geographic, and socioeconomic differences  in rates of TOLAC and VBAC.22  This 
variation, in the absence of a demonstrated basis in clinical science or patient preferences, 
raises concern about the efficiency, effectiveness, and patient -center edness of approach to 
delivery after CD.23  
Call to action . An NIH consensus conference statement noted that “the informed consent 
process for TOLAC and ERCD should be evidence -based, minimize bias, and incorporate a strong 
emphasis on the v alues and preferences of pregnant women,” and recommended 
“interprofessional collaboration to refine, validate, and implement decision -making and risk 
assessment tools” to accomplish that goal.[ADDRESS_1216810] o n the health of 
individuals and the health care system.25,26 Our overarching goal is to create and evaluate a tool 
to help TOLAC -eligible women delivering at hospi[INVESTIGATOR_871270], incorporat e their values and preferences, and participate in a shared decision 
making process with their providers to make informed decisions about delivery approach. We 
believe this improved informed decision making process will lead to increased TOLAC.  
Our prior s tudies of decision making . In a recently completed randomized study ( R01 
HD049686), PI [INVESTIGATOR_871271] a prenatal testing

Figure 1.  Delivery approach versus delivery mode.   For women who are 
eligible for trial of labor after  cesarean (TOLAC), a decision  regarding the 
delivery approach ( whether to schedule an elective repeat cesarean 
delivery (ERCD) or to undergo TOLAC) is made. The TOLAC rate is the 
percentage of eligible women who undergo a TOLAC (versus an ERCD). If 
TOLAC is chosen, the ultimate delivery mode  (VBAC or CD) is uncertain. 
Most, but not all, women who plan an ERCD will deliver via CD.

 about testing and birth defects, and better comprehension of the risks of amniocentesis or 
chorionic villus sampling.27 We believe the PROCEED study also has the potential to generate an 
evidence -based intervention that may lower the overall CD rate among diverse populatio ns of 
women, a critical yet elusive goal in obstetric care. Moreover, because the Prior Cesarean 
Decision app  will make explicit the probability of achieving VBAC, it is expected that the group of 
women who undertake TOLAC after using the decision app will  be enriched with those who are 
more likely to succeed in their attempt. As over 90% of morbidity occurs in women who 
undertake TOLAC but ultimately have a cesarean during labor28, this app may also lower the rate 
of CD without increasing either maternal or perinatal morbidity .

2.3.2.  Randomization  
Randomization tables will be generated with SAS v9.4 using the RAND function utilizing the 
Mersenne -Twister random number generator . To make treatment assignments difficult to 
anticipat e, the program will generate randomly permuted blocks of 8, 10, and 12 in random 
order. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_331505] (English/Spanish) and recruitment site. 
Randomization tables will be uploaded into a randomization module in the study data base by 
[CONTACT_549633]. To protect the integrity of the randomization sequence, RCs  will not have 
access to the randomization tables.

[LOCATION_002]. Three  sites serve primarily  lower income women, with many Spanish speakers. 
The remaining three sites serve  primarily English -speaking communities of higher  socioeconomic 
status.  
Participants will be randomized to receive the Prior Cesarean Decision app or usual care , 
stratified by [CONTACT_871292]. Participants will be selected for the study according to the 
criteria in Sections 3.1 and 3.2. They will be app roached, screened, and enrolled as described in 
Sections 5.1.1., 5.1.2., and 5.1.3. Issues related to participant retention and withdrawal from the 
study are described in Sections 3.3 and 3.4, respectively.  
3.1. Inclusion Criteria  
Women who meet all of the following criteria are eligible for inclusion in the study:  
• Prior cesarean delivery  
• Between 12  weeks 0 days and 24 weeks 6 days gestation at enrollment  
• English - or Spanish speaker  
• Prior low transverse cesarean  
3.2. Exclusion Criteria  
Women who meet any of the f ollowing criteria will be excluded from this study:  
• No prior cesarean delivery , or more than one  
• Multiple gestation pregnancy  
• Unable to speak English or Spanish  
• Prior VBAC  
• Ineligible for TOLAC ( due to prior classical cesarean , prior uterine surgery, T -incision, or 
other contraindication)  
• Delivering at outside institution  
3.3. Participant Retention 
Once a participant enrolls in PROCEED, the study site will make every effort to retain her in the 
study for the entire follow- up period in order to minimize pos sible b ias associated with loss to 
follow -up. Components of such procedures may include:  
• Thorough explanation of the study interview schedule and procedural requirements 
during the informed consent process.  
• Collection of email and/or phone contact [CONTACT_871293].  
• Repeated contact [CONTACT_871294].  
• Immediate follow -up for missed appointments.  
• In-person approach of patients visiting the site for prenatal care if contact [CONTACT_761843] t hrough email or phone.   
• Follow -up with patients delivering at outside institutions to obtain verbal report of the 
delivery outcome and consent for release of medical records.  
3.4. Participant Withdrawal  
Regardless of the participant retention methods used, participants may voluntarily withdraw 
from the study for any reason at any time. The site PI [INVESTIGATOR_871272]/or if they are unwilling or unable to comply with required study 
procedures. Partic ipants may also be withdrawn if the study sponsor, regulatory authorities, or 
site IRB terminate the study prior to its planned end date.  
The study team will evaluate participants withdrawn from the study on a case -by-case basis to 
determine whether delivery outcomes may be collected from the chart and retained in analyses. 
A final determination will be made according to a participant’s stated preference for use of her 
chart data and the data use guidelines set forth in the informed consent form.

Women who establish prenatal care at UCSF are typi[INVESTIGATOR_871273] [ADDRESS_1216814] obstetrical visit. The initial intake visit is in person and is conducted by 
[CONTACT_871295]  (NP) , certified nurse midwives (CNM) , 
PROCEED Study Protocol………………           - 15- [ADDRESS_1216815]  obstetrician s or maternal fetal medicine (MFM) specialists  depending on patient 
preference or risk based upon questionnaire by [CONTACT_871296].    
A complete medical, surgical and obstet rical history and physical exam, including a 
viability/dating ultrasound , is performed .  Note is made of prior pregnancy histories, including 
gestational age at delivery, pregnancy complications and modes of prior deliveries. I f a patient 
gives a history of c esarean delivery (CD ), attempts are made to obtain the operative report to 
review indications and hysterotomy type. Discussions regarding candidacy for trial of labor are 
initiated by [CONTACT_871297]/benefits and alternatives.   Calculation and 
discussion of likelihood of successful vaginal birth after CS using the MFMU calculator is 
common but not universal.   The discuss ions and patient choice are  documented in the problem 
list. If the patient was followed by a NP or CNM throughout the pregnancy she is referred at 
least once to an obstetrician or MFM for a discussion regarding the mode of delivery.  At 34 -35 
weeks gestati on, if patient chooses ERCD, she is scheduled in the birth center OR schedule at 39 
weeks.   If she chooses to undergo TOLAC, a discussion of timing of delivery or induction of labor 
is conducted  in the OB clinic with the clinician ; otherwise spontaneous la bor is 
awaited .  Patients who choose to undergo a TOLAC do not  sign written consents at 
UCSF.   Surgical consents are signed by [CONTACT_871298].    
Marin Community Clinic . At Marin Community Clinics, obstetric patients initiate care with an RN 
whose scope of practice includes intake examinations, patient triage, and initial review of 
laboratory and diagnostic results. At the intake appointment, the obstetric nurse reviews the 
patient’s medical and obstetric  history, initiates routine initial laboratory studies, and provides 
the patient with educational material. Most of the patients seen at our site, which is a Federally 
Qualified Health Care Center, are eligible for Medi- Cal, so the obstetric nurse also ensures that 
the patient begins the insurance eligibility process. After this initial intake appointment, patients 
are referred for an initial appointment with an obstetric provider who might be a nurse midwife, 
a family practice physician, or a nurse practitioner. Patients with complicated medical issues are 
referred to the two obstetricians who serve as consultants to the other providers.  
Patients with a prior cesarean section are screened for PROCEED eligibility and participation in 
the study is discussed by [CONTACT_871299]. Patients are also 
identified and screened during their subsequent visits with obstetric providers. The Site Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_871274] a patient would like to participate and forwards demographic 
information for these patients to the PROCEED Study Coordinator who contacts the patients for 
interviews.  
All patients who have had a prior cesarean and  are eligible for a TOLAC are counseled regarding 
mode of delivery for their current pregnancy.   A significant number of our patients are Spanish 
speaking and are scheduled between [ADDRESS_1216816] prenatal visit and may be revisited throughout th e course of the pregnancy.  If 
elective repeat cesarean delivery (ERCD) is preferred, or even considered, a slot on the OR 
schedule is often reserved, at whatever gestational age and date are deemed acceptable and 
appropriate after conversations between th e patient and provider.

Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_871275] [ADDRESS_1216817]; attempts

Healthcare system. Discussions about approach  of delivery generally begin as early as at the first 
prenatal visit and are revisited throughout the course of the pregnancy . Risks and benefits of 
trials of labor after cesarean are reviewed in detail and women’s preferences, even if 
provisional, are recorded in their problem lists. Calculation and documentation of the likelihood 
of successful vaginal birth after cesarean usin g the "MFMU calculator" is common but not 
universal. If elective repeat cesarean delivery (ERCD) is preferred, or even considered, a slot on 
the OR schedule is often reserved, at whatever gestational age and date are deemed acceptable 
and appropriate after conversations between the patient and provider . The primary provider 
will often schedule a time when s/he is available. For patients desiring ERCD who are enrolled in 
midwifery care, a visit with a physician provider is often scheduled prior to the planne d delivery 
date. For women considering TOLAC, risks and benefits of induction of labor are reviewed 
should indication (including post -term pregnancy) arise. In the third trimester, women sign 
written informed consent for care on Labor and Delivery, including for repeat cesarean delivery 
or TOLAC where applicable.  
Note:  At all study sites, usual care for women with a prior cesarean includes counseling  by [CONTACT_871300] . No formal educational intervention, web tools, or decision 
suppo rt is in place at any site.  Use of the NICHD VBAC prediction tool is at the discretion of the 
prenatal provider.   
4.2. Intervention  
The Prior Cesarean Decision app (Appendices 1 and 2) includes the following features: 1) 
approximately 15 minutes of web -based content, 2) topic -specific content and graphics, 3) user -
specific risk data presented in a dynamic and interactive environment, and 4) content in both 
PROCEED Study Protocol………………           - 17- 06 January 2016  
 English and Spanish. The program is organized into segments and sub -segments that are 
interactive and seq uenced. To create a satisfying user experience and enhance user interaction, 
some segments include “learn more” buttons to access additional content. Users enter clinical 
information and responses to values clarification exercises, taking advantage of the mHealth 
platform to increase patient engagement while targeting both intuition and deliberation to 
optimize the effectiveness of decision support.[ADDRESS_1216818] s Collaboration (IPDAS) quality checklist30 to confirm that the content, development 
process, and effectiveness of the Prior Cesarean Decision app conform to the highest standards. 
Published data, as well as our own testing of prior interactive multimedia decision tools, 
provided the foundation for the content and framework for the Prior Cesa rean Decision app.  
Focus groups and one -on-one interviews were conducted at all sites prior to initiation of 
enrollment for the RCT. Women of varying literacy levels who were patients of the institution 
and had a prior cesarean section within the past thre e years were invited to participate in a one -
time 60 -90 minute feedback session with study personnel in which they completed a basic 
demographics questionnaire and were shown various versions of the app during the 
development process. The sessions were aud io recorded and staff took notes of specific 
feedback to incorporate into the app. The app developers also attended some sessions to hear 
directly from potential future users. Participants were remunerated $60 for their participation.  
 
5.0 STUDY PROCEDURES  
5.1. Overview  
The RC will perform a preliminary eligibility screening by [CONTACT_871301] (see section 5.1.1.). Women with one prior cesarean who speak 
English or Spanish and do not appear to have any con traindications to VBAC will be identified 
and approached for in -person eligibility review.  
Women will be approached in the clinic waiting area before a prenatal appointment, informed 
of their potential eligibility for the study, and asked to complete and return a printed copy of the 
opt-in form (see section 5.1.2,). If time permits  and the woman is eligible and interested in 
participating, screening, enrollment, and randomization will take place same -day and 
immediately after the opt- in form is completed.  
All study instruments will be administered in the language preferred by [CONTACT_47991], English 
or Spanish. A b aseline screening form will be completed to verify the woman’s eligibility, then 
written informed consent obtained from those eligible and interested in participating. 
Participant sociodemographic characteristics, expected due date, and current preference as to 
delivery approach will be collected using a b aseline questionnaire. The participant will then be 
randomized to app (intervention) or no app (control). Participants  randomized to app will be 
provided an iPad tablet pre -loaded with the app to view at their  own pace (see sections 4.2 and 
5.1.3. for more information) . A short health literacy assessment will be administered after the 
app.  Apart from the  app, the intervention arm will receive usual  care. A woman randomized to 
no app will complete the baseline questi onnaire including the health literacy assessment, and 
will not view the app.  
Patient -reported secondary outcomes will be assessed at 34 weeks 0 days to 37 weeks 6 days  
gestation through a p hone follow -up interview administered by a n interviewer blinded to  the 
randomization group of the participant  (see section 5.1.4.). After delivery, chart review will be 
performed by a blinded co -investigator t o ascertain the primary outcome  of delivery approach  
(TOLAC or ERCD), the secondary outcome of  delivery  mode (vag inal or cesarean)  and any 
contraindications to TOLAC that developed post -randomization (see section 5.1.5.). Research 
assistants will also review the chart to collect other clinical data from the delivery encounter  
including the secondary maternal and neon atal morbidity outcomes .  
Participants will receive $40 in remuneration for participating in the b aseline screening and 
enrollment interview and $[ADDRESS_1216819] (see section 5.1.6.).  
5.1.1.  Chart audit (<25 weeks gestation)  
The medical charts of wom en who will be  <[ADDRESS_1216820] no contraindications to VBAC will be flagged 
for furt her in -person eligibility review.  
5.1.2.  Opt-in form (<25 weeks gestation)  
Women flagged for follow -up according to the chart audit will be approached in the clinic 
waiting area  before the prenatal appointment  or told about the study by [CONTACT_871302]. Women interested in participating will be  asked to complete and return a printed copy 
of the opt -in form (Appendices 3 and 4) . If the woman meets gestational age criteria for baseline 
screening (see section 5.1.3) and has enough time to complete th e baseline screening and 
enrollment interview (approximately 15 minutes), the screening questionnaire can be 
administered on the same day  (see section 5.1.3.). Otherwise, she will be contact[CONTACT_871303]. A record of every woman 
approached will be kept in a REDCap database.  
5.1.3.  Baseline screening and e nrollment interview (12  weeks 0 days to 24  weeks 6 days gestation)  
Screening Questionnaire . In-person screening for eligibility will be administered by [CONTACT_871304]  12 weeks 0 days  and 24 weeks 6 days gestation, usually immediately 
after the opt- in form is c ollected. Eligibility will be assessed using a seven -question screening 
questionnaire (Appendices 5 and 6). A woman will be confirmed eligible if she self -reports all of 
the following: (1) a due date correspon ding to a gestational age of 12 weeks 0 days  to 24 weeks 
6 days at time of interview, (2) carrying a singleton pregnancy, (3) a single prior cesarean 
section, (4) a cesarean section at her most recent delivery, (5) the cesarean section was not 
‘classical’, i. e., the cut on the uterus does not run up an d down, (6) does not recall any other 
uterine surgeries that would make her ineligible for a cesarean section, e.g. a myomectomy for 
removal of uterine fibroids, (7) planning to deliver at the current institution. Responses to the 
screening questionnaire w ill be collected in a REDCap database.  
Consent . After the screening, printed informed consent and permission for release of medical 
records will be obtained from eligible participants using the consent and HIPAA forms 
(Appendices 7 -10; see sections 8.2 an d 8.3 for more information).  
Baseline Questionnaire . The b aseline questionnaire (Appendices 11 and 12) will be administered 
by [CONTACT_871305]. This form collects participant age, race/ethnicity, education, income, 
form of health insurance, estimated  due date, and current preference for delivery approach. A 
PROCEED Study Protocol………………           - 19- 06 January 2016  
 print copy of the questionnaire will be offered to the participant to follow along as questions are 
read aloud (Appendix 13). The RC will keep track of the time at the start and end of the 
intervie w and note if there is an interruption to the interview lasting more than [ADDRESS_1216821] if anyone is with the participant during the interview. Questionnaire data will 
be collected in a REDCap database.  
Randomization and intervention . Treatment group will be assigned according to a randomization 
table in REDCap generated by [CONTACT_871306] -investigator. If randomized to app, the 
participant will be given a tablet to view the app at her own pace (Appendices 1 and 2). The app 
will pro vide information on potential maternal and neonatal complications from vaginal and 
cesarean deliveries, values clarification questions, and  an individualized estimate of the 
likelihood of a successful TOLAC. After viewing the app, a printed summary sheet w ith her  
answers to the values clarification questions  and probability of successful TOLAC will be 
provided to each participant to take home (Appendices 14 and 15). More information about the 
app is provided in section 4.2. A participant randomized to the c ontrol arm will not view the 
app. If she inquires about the intervention, she will be  told it consists of standardized 
information about the benefits and risks of trial of labor and elective cesarean.  
Health Literacy Assessment . The interview will conclude  with a short health literacy assessment 
(Appendices 11 and 12) which evaluates a woman’s ability to interpret a nutritional label. The 
assessment will be completed by [CONTACT_871307].  
Remuneration and follow -up reminder . Women who complete the baseli ne interview will 
receive $[ADDRESS_1216822] (Appendices 16 and 17) or check .   
5.1.4.  Phone follow -up interview (34 - to 37 weeks gestation)  
The Phone Follow -up interview will be completed with participants in both arms of the study 
between [ADDRESS_1216823] data on the 
secondary study endpoints of knowledge about TOLAC and ERCD; decisional conflict; shared 
decision -making regarding  delivery approach; decision self- efficacy ; and decisional satisfaction.    
Chart audit . Before contact[CONTACT_30697] a participant, t he RC will review  her chart to establish whether 
she is still pregnant,  has already delivered , or has experienced pregnancy loss before 22 weeks .  
Phone interview . If the participant has not yet delivered, she will be contact[CONTACT_871308] 33 
weeks gestation to schedule a time for the p hone follow -up interview. A copy of the p hone 
follow -up questionnaire (Appendices 18 and 19) will be offered to the participant by [CONTACT_871309]. The questionnaire will be 
administered by a different interviewer and collected in a separate REDCap database than the 
baseline questionnaire to ensure the interviewer  remain s blinded to th e participant’s 
randomization assignment.  
The phone follow -up interview will consist of: (1) a six -item short form of the Spi[INVESTIGATOR_73593]-
Trait Anxiety Inventory, which assesses the woman’s general anxiety level31, (2) eight questions 
to assess the woman’s knowledge of TOLAC and ERCD adapted from a published questionnaire 
32, (3) a [ADDRESS_1216824] Scale33, (4) an 11 -item Decisional Self- Efficacy scale34, (5) a 
single -item assessment of the woman’s preferred role in the decision -making concerning her 
delivery approach35, (5) a 9 -item shared decision making questionnaire (adapted from the SDM -
Q-936), and (6) a six -item Satisfaction with Decision Scale37. More information about these 
survey instruments can be found in section 7.1.2.  
During the p hone follow -up interview, the woman will be asked where she plans to deliver. If at 
an outside institution, the RC will request the participant’s consent to be contact[CONTACT_871310]-delivery questionnaire and to have a cop y of her delivery record forwarded to the study 
team (see section 5.1.6.).  
If the participant is no longer pregnant at the time of the p hone follow -up interview, the RC will 
administer an abbreviated form of the p hone follow -up questionnaire documenting w here the 
woman delivered, date of delivery, delivery approach, and method of delivery. Women who had 
a loss before  22 weeks will not be contact[CONTACT_5365] a phone follow -up interview.  
Remuneration . Women who complete the telephone interview will receive $[ADDRESS_1216825] or check.  
5.1.5.  Chart audits (after delivery ) 
Participant charts will be reviewed after delivery to abstract delivery approach, delivery mode, 
and other cli nical data ( Appendices 20 and 21 ). Abstraction of delivery outcome data and any 
contraindications to TOLAC before delivery  will be performed by a PI, co -investigator or research 
coordinator who is blinded to the randomization assignment. Other data from th e delivery 
encounter, including maternal and neonatal morbidities and  findings from the cervical exam at 
time of admission , will be abstracted by [CONTACT_941] R C. Data will be collected in REDCap. A comments 
box on the data collection form will allow RCs to document challenges interpreting the chart, 
which can also be raised at a coordinator call or addressed to a co -investigator or PI [INVESTIGATOR_554731].  
Investigator review . For investigator review of outcomes, the delivery note may provide clarity; 
in other cases, review of both the labor and delivery and prenatal record will be necessary. 
Whether the patient developed an absolute contraindication to TOLAC before her delivery 
admission may be obtained from the op note. Breech, Previa, or any congenital anomaly not 
compatible with vaginal delivery should be documented. To establish planned approach for the 
current delivery, the investigator will use the following definitions:  
• Participant planned ERCD  if:  
o Delivered by [CONTACT_871311] 39 weeks prior to labor for no reason other 
than desired RCD rather than TOLAC  
o Presented in labor prior to scheduled cesarean, and opted to proceed with 
cesarean for primary reason that de sired RCD rather than TOLAC  
o Presented with indication for delivery prior to scheduled cesarean 
(preeclampsia, IUGR, NRFT) and opted to proceed with cesarean for primary 
reason that desired RCD rather than TOLAC  
 
Note: If there are t wo indications for RCD in the chart, including a 
nonelective indication for timing of delivery less than [ADDRESS_1216826]  as the "nonelective" indication and  the 
second as ERCD.  
 
• Participant considered TOLAC if:  
o Underwent TOLAC  
o Planned TOLAC if labor prior to certain gestational age, but reached that 
gestational age limit and underwent ERCD  
o Planned TOLAC if spontaneous labor, but then developed an indication for 
induction and underwent ERCD  
PROCEED Study Protocol………………           - 21- [ADDRESS_1216827] -delivery phone interview for outside deliveries (after due date)  
If a participant’s due date has elapsed by [CONTACT_871312], she has likely delivered at an outside institution. In such cases, the RC will 
contact [CONTACT_871313]  a time for the p ost-delivery phone interview. 
During the interview, the participant will be queried for self- report of the date of delivery, 
delivery approach and mode, and other pertinent information such as whether the outside 
facility offers TOLAC, whe ther the woman experienced contractions or rupture of membranes, 
use of pi[INVESTIGATOR_871276], use of forceps or vacuum to assist with delivery, baby’s 
birthweight, maternal weight gain during pregnancy, and other information. In addition, the RC 
will request the name [CONTACT_871328] [CONTACT_871314]. Responses will be collected using the 
post-delivery questionnaire (Appendices 22 and 23) and stored  in a REDCap database  (Appendix 
24).  
6.[ADDRESS_1216828] monthly  conference calls during the period of study 
implementation and additional ad hoc calls will be convened as needed . 
RCs will report all participant complaints to the investigative team.  These will be discussed 
during weekl y/biweekly RC calls and monthly investigator calls.  
Each  study site is responsible for continuous close monitoring and management of adverse 
events (AE) in accordance with the protocol for AE reporting at their home institution 
(Appendices 27-30). The study site PIs  are responsible for the initial evaluation and reporting of 
safety information and for alerting the investigative team  if unexpected concerns arise.  
6.2. Reporting Requirements for this Study  
The site PI [INVESTIGATOR_871277] s it may 
qualify as an Unanticipated Problem or Adverse Event because the event meets all three criteria 
listed below:  
• Unanticipated in severity or frequency  AND  
• At least possibly  relat ed to the study intervention AND   
• Is Serious OR  not serious but suggests placing subjects or others at greater risk  
In addition, all SAEs will be reported to the study team within [ADDRESS_1216829] for the delivery : 
• Proportion of women who elect TOL AC 
7.1.2.   Secondary Endpoints  
Consistent with the secondary study hypothesis that women who are randomized to use the 
Prior Cesarean Decision app will be more likely to have a VBAC compared to women who 
receive only usual care, the following endpoint will be ass essed  in the medical record for the 
delivery :  
• Proportion of women who have a VBAC  
Consistent with the secondary study hypothesis that women who are randomized to use the 
Prior Cesarean Decision app will be more knowledgeable about TOLAC and ERCD and their 
potential outcomes compared to women who receive only usual care, the following endpoint 
will be assessed  at weeks 34 - to 37 gestation:  
• Knowledge about TOLAC and ERCD and their potential outcomes, as assessed with a  
modified version of a published quest ionnaire.[ADDRESS_1216830] compared to women who 
receive only usual care, the following endpoint will be assessed  at weeks 34 - to 37 gestation:  
• Decisional conflict regarding delivery approach, as measured based on the participant’s 
score on a well- validated Decisional Conflict Scale33 recommended for the assessment of 
decision quality by [CONTACT_871315].[ADDRESS_1216831] score and 5 
subscale scores and has been used extensively to evaluate patient -centered decision 
tools in a wide range of clinical contexts.39  
Consistent with the secondary study hypothesis that women who are randomized to use the 
Prior Cesarean Decision app will report higher levels of shared decision making r egarding 
delivery approach compared to women who receive only usual care, the following endpoint will 
be assessed  at weeks 34 - to 37 gestation:  
• Shared decision making, as measured using the SDM -Q-9, a psychometrically evaluated 
self- assessment tool.36  
Consistent with the secondary study hypothesis that women who are randomized to use the 
Prior Cesarean Decision app will experience greater decision self- efficacy compared to women 
who receive only usual care, the following endpoint will be assessed  at wee ks 34 - to 37 
gestation:  
• Decision  self-efficacy,  as measured using a validated 11 -item Decisional Self- efficacy 
Scale.34   
Consistent with the secondary s tudy hypothesis that women who are randomized to use the 
Prior Cesarean Decision app will report higher levels of decision satisfaction compared to 
women who receive only usual care, the following endpoint will be assessed  at weeks 34 - to 37 
gestation:  
• Decisional satisfaction, as measured using the Satisfaction with Decision Scale, a 6 -item 
scale designed to measure global satisfaction with a decision and to differentiate this 
from related aspects of satisfaction.37   
Consistent with the secondary study hypothesis that women who are randomized to use the 
Prior Cesarean Decision app will experience lower rates of maternal and neonatal morbidity

7.2. Sample Size  
Table 1 shows the minimum difference in TOLAC due to the Prior Cesarean Decision  app that has 
80% power . For a recruitment goal of 1,320 participants (1:1 per intervention arm) and 
assuming 5% loss to follow -up and a baseline rate of 33% in the control group, we will have at 
least 80% power to detect an 8% absolu te increase in TOLAC due to the app.

7.3. Blinding  
Assessors of the primary and secondary outcomes will remain blinded to the randomization 
assignment throughout the study. The s tudy participant and the RC who administers the 
baseline screening and e nrollment interview will be aware of the participant’s randomization 
assignment. Phone follow -up question naires and chart audits will be administered by a different 
interviewer and collected in a separate database than the b aseline questionnaire to ensure the 
interviewer remains blinded to the participant’s randomization assignment during collection of 
study endpoints.  
7.4. Data Analysis  
We will present sample characteristics by [CONTACT_871316] n’s and %’s for 
categorical variables and means/standard deviations or medians and interquartile ranges for 
continuous variables.  
For our primary outcome  TOLAC and major secondary outcome VBAC, we will calculate the 
proportion with the outcome by [CONTACT_871317] a Poisson regression model which has been  adjusted for recruitment site and 
language of interv iew and includes robust standard errors. Comparisons will be presented in the 
form of relative risks and 95% confidence intervals. Differences between treatment arms for the 
maternal and neonatal morbidity outcomes will be evaluated in the same manner. For 
continuous outcomes (e.g., decisional conflict, shared decision making regarding delivery 
approach, decision self -efficacy, and decisional satisfaction), we will calculate the mean score by 
[CONTACT_871318].  
For our primary outcome TOLAC and major secondary outcome VBAC, we will examine 
interactions of treatment arm by [CONTACT_941] a priori defined factors of site, race/ethnicity, and 
language. For each inte raction, differences will be evaluated using a Poisson regression model 
with an interaction term for treatment arm by [CONTACT_6496].  
Analyses will exclude women who had a pregnancy loss before [ADDRESS_1216833] annually and within three months of study termination 
or comp letion. These reports will include the total number of participants enrolled in the study, 
the number of participants who completed the study, all changes in the research activity, and all 
unanticipated problems involving risks to human subjects or others.   
8.2. Informed Consent  
Written informed consent will be obtained fr om each study participant prior to enrollment using 
an informed consent form approved by [CONTACT_871319]. A copy of her signed informed consent form wil l be offered to the participant 
(Appendices 7 and 8).  
8.3. HIPAA  
Permission for release of medical records for ascertainment of clinical endp oints will be 
obtained from participant s with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability (HIPAA ) 
form, which documents the personal health information that may be released, to whom it may 
be released, how it may be used, when permission for its release expi[INVESTIGATOR_6054], and under what terms 
permission may be cancelled (Appendices 9 and 10).  
8.4. Risks  
Breach of c onfidentiality . Although study sites will make every effort to protect participant 
privacy and confidentiality, it is possible that participants' involvement in the study could 
become known to others. We are evaluating a mobile health intervention  linked t o a cloud 
platform  and there is the possibility that study participation could become known to others

9.1.3.   Database Management and Data Quality Monitoring  
Randomization assignment, survey responses, and chart audit data for all sites will be collected 
and stored in REDCap databases hosted centrally at UCSF . Data will be behind an institutional 
firewall and acc essible through a web portal via login credentials known only to qualified study 
staff. Randomization assignment will be collected in a separate database than the p hone follow -
up questionnaire and chart audits to ensure staff remain blinded to treatment gr oup while 
gathering outcome data. Sites will maintain their own tracking and recruitment logs in local 
REDCap databases (Appendix 24). Protected health information , such as patient names, medical 
record number, estimated due date, clinic visit schedule, telephone number and email address 
will be collected on the tracking and recruitment log to aid with scheduling and participant 
follow -up. A unique study identifier will be generated for each participant to link records across 
databases.  
Data from the app will be collected through a secure, password -protected online portal linked to 
a PostGRE SQL database on a Heroku cloud platform, which provides best -in-class server 
security, including firewalls, physical security, and regular compliance auditing.  
Clinical, survey and app data will be transferred to SAS statistical software for cleaning, 
reporting and analysis. Quality control reports and queries will be generated and distributed to 
the study sites on a routine schedule for verification and resolution.

STUDY SCHEMA  
 
Purpose:  
 To assess the effect  of the PROCEED Prior Cesarean 
Decision Support app (versus usual care without the app) 
on rates of trial of labor after cesarean (TOLAC) among 
pregnant women with a prior cesarean delivery  (CD) . 
Design:  
 This is a two -armed randomized controlled trial (R CT) 
among 1,320 English - or Spanish -speaking pregnant 
women (1:1 randomization sequence for the 
intervention).   
Study 
Population:  
 Pregnant women receiving prenatal care at a 
participating healthcare facility. Women will be eligible to 
enroll if they mee t all of the following criteria.  
Inclusion criteria:  
• Between 12  weeks 0 days and 24 weeks 6 days 
gestation at enrollment  
• Speak English or Spanish  
• Have had one  and only one prior CD 
• Prior low transverse cesarean  
 
Exclusion criteria:  
• No prior cesarean delivery , or more than one   
• Multiple gestation pregnancy  
• Prior vaginal birth after cesarean  
• Any contraindications to TOLAC   (prior classical 
cesarean, prior uterine surgery, T -incisions, other 
contraindication)  
• Delivering at outside institution  
 
Study Size:  
 The recruitment goal is 1,320 participants, for a 
recruitment rate of 40 participants per month and a final 
subset of 627 per arm (1254) projecting 5% loss to follow 
up.     
 
PROCEED Study Protocol………………           - 7- 28 September 2018  
 Study 
Intervention:  
 Participan ts in the intervention arm will be provided with  
the PROCEED Prior Cesarean Decision app, which includes 
approximately 15 minutes of dynamic web -based 
informational content including potential maternal and 
neonatal complications from vaginal and cesarean 
deliveries, values clarification questions, and 
individualized estimates of likelihood of successful 
TOLAC.   
Study 
Duration:  
 Data collection start date: January 2016  
Estimated data collection end date:  July 2019   
 
 
Primary 
Hypothesis:  
 Compared to women who receive usual care only, women 
who are randomized to use the Prior Cesarean Decision 
app will be more likely to undergo TOLAC.  
Secondary 
Hypotheses:  
 Compared  to women who receive usual care only, 
women randomized to use the Prior Cesarean Decision 
app will:  
1. be more likely to have a vaginal birth after cesarean 
(major secondary outcome)  
2. be more knowledgeable about TOLAC and elective 
repeat cesarean delivery (ERCD) and their potential 
outcomes  
3. experience less decisional conflict  
4. report higher levels of shared decision making 
regardin g delivery approach  
5. report higher levels of decision self- efficacy   
6. report higher levels of decision satisfaction  
7. experience lower rates of maternal and neonatal 
morbidities

[LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_871281]………………           - 8- [ADDRESS_1216843] of cesarean rate in the US.  Cesarean delivery (CD) is the most common 
inpatient surgery in the US, accounting for nearly one third of births annually. In the last decade, 
the CD rate has increased by [CONTACT_3450] 50%, with almost 1.3 million procedures performed 
in 2012.1 Moreover, at $7.[ADDRESS_1216844] been associated with an increase in 
major maternal morbidity,3–5 with corresponding increases in length of inpatient care following 
delivery and frequency of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_61715].6 Organizations including Healthy People7, the 
American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)8, and the American College of 
Nurse Midwives9 have targeted reducing the CD rate as an important public health goal for more 
than a decade; however, identifying interventions to achieve this goal has pro ven challenging.  
Causes and consequences of the rising rate of repeat cesareans. Repeat CDs are a significant 
contributor to the increased cesarean rate, resulting from the combination of a rising rate of 
primary CD and a decreasing rate of vaginal birth after cesarean, which declined from a high of 
28.3% in [ZIP_CODE] to 9.2% in 2010.[ADDRESS_1216845] been posited as contributing 
to this decline, including the decreasing number of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_871265]. In addition, a substantial 
portion of the decrease is related to women foregoing trial of labor after cesarean (TOLAC) even 
though their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_871266]. For example, among hospi[INVESTIGATOR_871267]- Fetal Medicine Units network, TOLAC rates declined from 51.8% to 
29.8% (p<.001) from 1999- 2002, even though TOLAC continued to be offered at all sites.11 In a 
study of “good TOLAC candidates” at a 14 -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_871268], the 
average TOLAC rate was only 30%.12 And at Northwestern, one of the clinical sites for our study,

 TOLAC rates decreased by [CONTACT_1192] -thirds from 1995 to 2010 although all providers offer this labor 
approach.  
Importantly, the declining VBAC rate is not primarily due to new and more concerning 
information about the risks of TOLAC; recent epi[INVESTIGATOR_871269] -level outcomes of TOLAC, such as the chance of VBAC or of uterine rupture if a 
TOLAC is attempted, are no  different today than they were three decades ago.2,13 –15  Similarly, 
this decline is not primarily due to changes in characteristics  of the population that would make 
VBAC less likely if TOLAC is undertaken; these decreases in TOLAC have affected all women, 
regardless of their probability of VBAC or risks of adverse TOLAC outcomes.11 The extent t o 
which these changes are 
driven by [CONTACT_871291]. Data from 
qualitative studies offer 
some insight, but the 
value of that information 
is limited by [CONTACT_11339] -
generalizability of the 
study populations and 
the lack of quantitative 
analyses.16–21 
Furthermore, while 
decreased TOLAC rates 
are occurring throughout 
the US, there are 
persistent, unexplained 
racial/ethnic, geographic, and socioeconomic differences  in rates of TOLAC and VBAC.22  This 
variation, in the absence of a demonstrated basis in clinical science or patient preferences, 
raises concern about the efficiency, effectiveness, and patient -center edness of approach to 
delivery after CD.23  
Call to action . An NIH consensus conference statement noted that “the informed consent 
process for TOLAC and ERCD should be evidence -based, minimize bias, and incorporate a strong 
emphasis on the v alues and preferences of pregnant women,” and recommended 
“interprofessional collaboration to refine, validate, and implement decision -making and risk 
assessment tools” to accomplish that goal.[ADDRESS_1216846] o n the health of 
individuals and the health care system.25,26 Our overarching goal is to create and evaluate a tool 
to help TOLAC -eligible women delivering at hospi[INVESTIGATOR_871270], incorporat e their values and preferences, and participate in a shared decision 
making process with their providers to make informed decisions about delivery approach. We 
believe this improved informed decision making process will lead to increased TOLAC.  
Our prior s tudies of decision making . In a recently completed randomized study ( R01

eligible for trial of labor after  cesarean (TOLAC), a decision  regarding the 
delivery approach ( whether to schedule an elective repeat cesarean 
delivery (ERCD) or to undergo TOLAC) is made. The TOLAC rate is the 
percentage of eligible women who undergo a TOLAC (versus an ERCD). If 
TOLAC is chosen, the ultimate delivery mode  (VBAC or CD) is uncertain. 
Most, but not all, women who plan an ERCD will deliver via CD.

 about testing and birth defects, and better comprehension of the risks of amniocentesis or 
chorionic villus sampling.27 We believe the PROCEED study also has the potential to generate an 
evidence -based intervention that may lower the overall CD rate among diverse populatio ns of 
women, a critical yet elusive goal in obstetric care. Moreover, because the Prior Cesarean 
Decision app  will make explicit the probability of achieving VBAC, it is expected that the group of 
women who undertake TOLAC after using the decision app will  be enriched with those who are 
more likely to succeed in their attempt. As over 90% of morbidity occurs in women who 
undertake TOLAC but ultimately have a cesarean during labor28, this app may also lower the rate 
of CD without increasing either maternal or perinatal morbidity . 
13.0 STUDY HYPOTHESES AND DESIGN  
13.1. Primary Hypothesis  
The primary hypothesis of this study:  
• Compared to women who receive usual care only, women who are randomized to use the 
Prior Cesarean  Decision app will be more likely to undergo TOLAC.  
13.2. Secondary Hypotheses  
The secondary hypotheses of this study are:  
• Compared to women who receive usual care only, women randomized to use the Prior 
Cesarean Decision app will:  
8. be more likely to have a vagin al birth after cesarean ( VBAC ) (major secondary outcome) ;  
9. be more knowledgeable about TOLAC and ERCD and their potential outcomes;  
10. experience less decisional conflict;  
11. report higher levels of shared decision making regarding delivery approach;  
12. report higher levels of decision self -efficacy;  
13. report higher levels of decision satisfaction ; and  
14. experience lower rates of maternal and neonatal morbidities  
13.3. Study Design  
This is a two -armed RCT to assess the impact of a Prior Cesarean Decision app on the delivery 
outcomes of  1,320 English - or Spanish -speaking women with a prior cesarean delivery (1:1 
randomization sequence for the intervention).  Following is a consort diagram of the study:

13.3.2.  Randomization  
Randomization tables will be generated with SAS v9.4 using the RAND function utilizing the 
Mersenne -Twister random number generator . To make treatment assignments difficult to 
anticipat e, the program will generate randomly permuted blocks of 8, 10, and 12 in random 
order. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_331505] (English/Spanish) and recruitment site. 
Randomization tables will be uploaded into a randomization module in the study data base by 
[CONTACT_549633]. To protect the integrity of the randomization sequence, RCs  will not have 
access to the randomization tables.

[LOCATION_002]. Three  sites serve primarily  lower income women, with many Spanish speakers. 
The remaining three sites serve  primarily English -speaking communities of higher  socioeconomic 
status.  
Participants will be randomized to receive the Prior Cesarean Decision app or usual care , 
stratified by [CONTACT_871292]. Participants will be selected for the study according to the 
criteria in Sections 3.1 and 3.2. They will be app roached, screened, and enrolled as described in 
Sections 5.1.1., 5.1.2., and 5.1.3. Issues related to participant retention and withdrawal from the 
study are described in Sections 3.3 and 3.4, respectively.  
14.1. Inclusion Criteria  
Women who meet all of the foll owing criteria are eligible for inclusion in the study:  
• Prior cesarean delivery  
• Between 12  weeks 0 days and 24 weeks 6 days gestation at enrollment  
• English - or Spanish speaker  
• Prior low transverse cesarean  
• Unknown scar but TOLAC eligible  
 
PROCEED Study Protocol………………           - 13- 28 September 2018  
 14.2. Exclusion Criteria  
Women who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from this study:  
• No prior cesarean delivery , or more than one  
• Multiple gestation pregnancy  
• Unable to speak English or Spanish  
• Prior VBAC  
• Ineligible for TOLAC ( due to prior classical ces arean , prior uterine surgery, T -incision, or 
other contraindication)  
• Delivering at outside institution  
14.3. Participant Retention 
Once a participant enrolls in PROCEED, the study site will make every effort to retain her in the 
study for the entire follow -up period in order to minimize pos sible bias associated with loss to 
follow -up. Components of such procedures may include:  
• Thorough explanation of the study interview schedule and procedural requirements 
during the informed consent process.  
• Collection of email and/or phone contact [CONTACT_871293].  
• Repeated contact [CONTACT_871294].  
• Immediate follow -up for missed appointments.  
• In-person approach of patients visiting the site for pr enatal care if contact [CONTACT_871322].   
• Follow -up with patients delivering at outside institutions to obtain verbal report of the 
delivery outcome and consent for release of medical records.  
14.4. Participant Withdrawal  
Regardless of the participant retention methods used, participants may voluntarily withdraw 
from the study for any reason at any time. The site PI [INVESTIGATOR_871272]/or if they are unwilling  or unable to comply with required study 
procedures. Participants may also be withdrawn if the study sponsor, regulatory authorities, or 
site IRB terminate the study prior to its planned end date.  
The study team will evaluate participants withdrawn from th e study on a case -by-case basis to 
determine whether delivery outcomes may be collected from the chart and retained in analyses. 
A final determination will be made according to a participant’s stated preference for use of her 
chart data and the data use gu idelines set forth in the informed consent form.

preference or risk based upon questionnaire by [CONTACT_871296] .   
A complete medical, surgical and obstet rical history and physical exam, including a 
viability/dating ultrasound , is performed .  Note is made of prior pregnancy histories, including 
gestational age at delivery, pregnancy complications and modes of prior  deliveries. I f a patient 
gives a history of c esarean delivery (CD ), attempts are made to obtain the operative report to

initiated by [CONTACT_871297]/benefits and alternatives.   Calculation and 
discussion of likelihood of successful vaginal birth after CS using the MFMU calculator is 
common but not u niversal.   The discussions and patient choice are  documented in the problem 
list. If the patient was followed by a NP or CNM throughout the pregnancy she is referred at 
least once to an obstetrician or MFM for a discussion regarding the mode of delivery.  At 34 -35 
weeks gestation , if patient chooses ERCD, she is scheduled in the birth center OR schedule at 39 
weeks.   If she chooses to undergo TOLAC, a discussion of timing of delivery or induction of labor 
is conducted  in the OB clinic with the clinician ; otherwise spontaneous labor  is 
awaited .  Patients who choose to undergo a TOLAC do not  sign written consents at

have had a prior cesarean meet with an obstetrician late in the second trimester or early third 
trimester to discuss delivery  approach . Women who are eligible for TOLAC describe the 
circumstances of their previous cesarean to determine if the indication for cesarean may recur. 
Operative reports from prior surgery are requested when possible. The risks and benefits of 
TOLAC vs scheduled cesarean  are reviewed as well as  St. Luke’s protoco l for TOLAC  (needs IV, 
clear liquid diet, continuous fetal monitoring, etc). To gauge preferences, contingency plans  are 
discussed — what may happen if an induction is recommended or she remains pregnant  beyond

Marin Community Clinic . At Marin Community Clinics, obstetric patients initiate care with an RN 
whose scope of practice includes intake examinations, patien t triage, and initial review of 
laboratory and diagnostic results. At the intake appointment, the obstetric nurse reviews the 
patient’s medical and obstetric  history, initiates routine initial laboratory studies, and provides 
the patient with educational m aterial. Most of the patients seen at our site, which is a Federally 
Qualified Health Care Center, are eligible for Medi- Cal, so the obstetric nurse also ensures that 
the patient begins the insurance eligibility process. After this initial intake appointme nt, patients 
are referred for an initial appointment with an obstetric provider who might be a nurse midwife, 
a family practice physician, or a nurse practitioner. Patients with complicated medical issues are 
referred to the two obstetricians who serve as consultants to the other providers.

will often schedule a time when s/he is available. For patients desiring ERCD who are enrolled in 
midwifery care, a visit with a physician provider is often scheduled prior to the planned delivery 
date. For women considering TOLAC, risks and bene fits of induction of labor are reviewed 
should indication (including post -term pregnancy) arise. In the third trimester, women sign 
written informed consent for care on Labor and Delivery, including for repeat cesarean delivery 
or TOLAC where applicable.  
Note: At all study sites, usual care for women with a prior cesarean includes counseling  by [CONTACT_871300] . No formal educational intervention, web tools, or decision 
support is in place at any site.  Use of the NICHD VBAC prediction  tool is at the discretion of the 
prenatal provider.   
15.2. Intervention  
The Prior Cesarean Decision app (Appendices 1 and 2) includes the following features: 1) 
approximately 15 minutes of web -based content, 2) topic -specific content and graphics, 3) user -
specific risk data presented in a dynamic and interactive environment, and 4) content in both 
English and Spanish. The program is organized into segments and sub -segments that are 
interactive and sequenced. To create a satisfying user experience and enhance u ser interaction, 
some segments include “learn more” buttons to access additional content. Users enter clinical 
information and responses to values clarification exercises, taking advantage of the mHealth 
platform to increase patient engagement while target ing both intuition and deliberation to 
optimize the effectiveness of decision support.29  
The app was developed using a process based on the International Patient Decision Aids 
Standards Collaboration (IPDAS) quality checklist30 to confirm that the content, development 
process, and effectiveness of the Prior Cesarean Decision app c onform to the highest standards. 
Published data, as well as our own testing of prior interactive multimedia decision tools, 
provided the foundation for the content and framework for the Prior Cesarean Decision app.  
Focus groups and one -on-one interviews were conducted at all sites prior to initiation of 
enrollment for the RCT. Women of varying literacy levels who were patients of the institution 
and had a prior cesarean section within the past three years were invited to participate in a one -
time 60 -90 minu te feedback session with study personnel in which they completed a basic 
demographics questionnaire and were shown various versions of the app during the 
development process. The sessions were audio recorded and staff took notes of specific 
feedback to inc orporate into the app. The app developers also attended some sessions to hear 
directly from potential future users. Participants were remunerated $60 for their participation.  
 
16.0 STUDY PROCEDURES  
16.1. Overview  
The RC will perform a preliminary eligibility screening by [CONTACT_871301] (see section 5.1.1.). Women with one prior cesarean who speak 
English or Spanish and do not appear to have any contraindications to VBAC will be identified 
and approached for in -person eligibility review.  
Women will be approached in the clinic waiting area before a prenatal appointment, informed 
of their potential eligibility for the study, and asked to complete and return a printed cop y of the 
 
PROCEED Study Protocol………………           - 17- 28 September 2018  
 opt-in form (see section 5.1.2,). If time permits  and the woman is eligible and interested in 
participating, screening, enrollment, and randomization will take place same -day and 
immediately after the opt- in form is completed.  
All study instrumen ts will be administered in the language preferred by [CONTACT_47991], English 
or Spanish. A b aseline screening form will be completed to verify the woman’s eligibility, then 
written informed consent obtained from those eligible and interested in participat ing. 
Participant sociodemographic characteristics, expected due date, and current preference as to 
delivery approach will be collected using a b aseline questionnaire. The participant will then be 
randomized to app (intervention) or no app (control). Partic ipants  randomized to app will be 
provided an iPad tablet pre -loaded with the app to view at their  own pace (see sections 4.2 and 
5.1.3. for more information) . A short health literacy assessment will be administered after the 
app.  Apart from the  app, the intervention arm will receive usual  care. A woman randomized to 
no app will complete the baseline questionnaire including the health literacy assessment, and 
will not view the app.  
Patient -reported secondary outcomes will be assessed at 34 weeks 0 days to 37 weeks 6 days  
gestation through a p hone follow -up interview administered by a n interviewer blinded to the 
randomization group of the participant  (see section 5.1.4.). After delivery, chart rev iew will be 
performed by a blinded co -investigator t o ascertain the primary outcome  of delivery approach  
(TOLAC or ERCD), the secondary outcome of  delivery  mode (vaginal or cesarean)  and any 
contraindications to TOLAC that developed post -randomization (see  section 5.1.5.). Research 
assistants will also review the chart to collect other clinical data from the delivery encounter  
including the secondary maternal and neonatal morbidity outcomes .  
Participants will receive $40 in remuneration for participating in the b aseline screening and 
enrollment interview and $[ADDRESS_1216854] (see section 5.1.6.).  
16.1.1.  Chart audit (<25 weeks gestation)  
The medical charts of wom en who will be  <[ADDRESS_1216855] no contraindications to VBAC will be flagged 
for further in -person eligibility review.  
16.1.2.  Opt-in form (<25 weeks gestation)  
Women flagged for foll ow-up according to the chart audit will be approached in the clinic 
waiting area  before the prenatal appointment  or told about the study by [CONTACT_871302]. Women interested in participating will be  asked to complete and return a printed co py 
of the opt -in form (Appendices 3 and 4) . If the woman meets gestational age criteria for baseline 
screening (see section 5.1.3) and has enough time to complete the b aseline screening and 
enrollment interview (approximately 15 minutes), the screening questionnaire can be 
administered on the same day  (see section 5.1.3.). Otherwise, she will be contact[CONTACT_871303]. A record of every woman 
approached will be kept in a REDCap database.  
16.1.3.  Baseline screening and e nrollment interview (12  weeks 0 days to 24  weeks 6 days gestation)  
 
PROCEED Study Protocol………………           - 18- 28 September 2018  
 Screening Questionnaire . In-person screening for eligibility will be administered by [CONTACT_871304]  12 weeks 0 days  and 24 weeks 6 days gestation, usually immediately 
after the opt- in form is collected. Eligibility will be assessed using a seven -question screening 
questionnaire (Appendices 5 and 6). A woman will be confirmed eligible if she self -reports all of 
the foll owing: (1) a due date correspon ding to a gestational age of 12 weeks 0 days  to 24 weeks 
6 days at time of interview, (2) carrying a singleton pregnancy, (3) a single prior cesarean 
section, (4) a cesarean section at her most recent delivery, (5) the cesarean section was not 
‘classical’, i. e., the cut on the uterus does not run up and down, (6) does not recall any other 
uterine surgeries that would make her ineligible for a cesarean section, e.g. a myomectomy for 
removal of uterine fibroids, (7) planning to deliver at the current institution. Responses to the 
screening questionnaire will be collected in a REDCap database.  
Consent . After the screening, printed informed consent and permission for release of medical 
records will be obtained from eligible partic ipants using the consent and HIPAA forms 
(Appendices 7 -10; see sections 8.2 and 8.3 for more information).  
Baseline Questionnaire . The b aseline questionnaire (Appendices 11 and 12) will be administered 
by [CONTACT_871305]. This form collects participant age, race/ethnicity, education, income, 
form of health insurance, estimated due date, and current preference for delivery approach. A 
print copy of the questionnaire will be offered to the participant to follow along as questions are 
read aloud (Appendi x 13). The RC will keep track of the time at the start and end of the 
interview and note if there is an interruption to the interview lasting more than [ADDRESS_1216856] if anyone is with the participant during the interview. Questionnaire  data will 
be collected in a REDCap database.  
Randomization and intervention . Treatment group will be assigned according to a randomization 
table in REDCap generated by [CONTACT_871306] -investigator. If randomized to app, the 
participant will be given a tablet to view the app at her own pace (Appendices 1 and 2). The app 
will provide information on potential maternal and neonatal complications from vaginal and 
cesarean deliveries, values clarification questions, and  an individualized estimate of the 
likelihood of a successful TOLAC. After viewing the app, a printed summary sheet with her 
answers to the values clarification questions  and probability of successful TOLAC will be 
provided to each participant to take home (Appendices 14 and 15). More informati on about the 
app is provided in section 4.2. A participant randomized to the control arm will not view the 
app. If she inquires about the intervention, she will be  told it consists of standardized 
information about the benefits and risks of trial of labor and elective cesarean.  
Health Literacy Assessment . The interview will conclude with a short health literacy assessment 
(Appendices 11 and 12) which evaluates a woman’s ability to interpret a nutritional label. The 
assessment will be completed by [CONTACT_871324].  
Remuneration and follow -up reminder . Women who complete the baseline interview will 
receive $[ADDRESS_1216857] (Appendices 16 and 17) or check .   
16.1.4.  Phone follow -up interview (34 - to 37 weeks gestation)  
The Phone Follow -up interview will be completed with participants in both arms of the study 
between [ADDRESS_1216858] data on the 
secondary study endpoints of knowledge about TOLAC and ERCD; decisional conflict; sh ared 
decision -making regarding  delivery approach; decision self- efficacy ; and decisional satisfaction.    
Chart audit . Before contact[CONTACT_30697] a participant, t he RC will review  her chart to establish whether 
she is still pregnant,  has already delivered , or has experienced pregnancy loss before 22 weeks .  
 
PROCEED Study Protocol………………           - 19- 28 September 2018  
 Phone interview . If the participant has not yet delivered, she will be contact[CONTACT_871308] 33 
weeks gestation to schedule a time for the p hone follow -up interview. A copy of the  phone 
follow -up questionnaire (Appendices 18 and 19) will be offered to the participant by [CONTACT_871309]. The questionnaire will be 
administered by a different interviewer and collected in a separate RED Cap database than the 
baseline questionnaire to ensure the interviewer  remain s blinded to the participant’s 
randomization assignment  (Appendix 24) . 
The phone follow -up interview will consist of: (1) a six -item short form of the Spi[INVESTIGATOR_73593]-
Trait Anxiety Inventory, which assesses the woman’s general anxiety level31, (2) eigh t questions 
to assess the woman’s knowledge of TOLAC and ERCD adapted from a published questionnaire 
32, (3) a [ADDRESS_1216859] Scale33, (4) an 11 -item Decisional Self -Efficacy scale34, (5) a 
single -item assessment of the woman’s preferred role in the decision -making concerning her 
delivery approach35, (5) a 9 -item shared decision making questionnaire (adapted from the SDM -
Q-936), and (6) a six -item Satisfaction with Decision Scale37. More information about these 
survey instruments can be found in section 7.1.2.  
During the p hone follow -up interview, the woman will be asked where she plans to deliver. If at 
an outside institution, the RC will request the participant’s consent to be contact[CONTACT_871310]-delivery questionnaire and to have a cop y of her delivery record forwarded to the study 
team (see section 5.1.6.).  
If the participant is no longer pregnant at the time of the p hone follow -up interview, the RC will 
administer an abbreviated form of the p hone follow -up questionnaire documenting w here the 
woman delivered, date of delivery, delivery approach, and method of delivery. Women who had 
a loss before  22 weeks will not be contact[CONTACT_5365] a phone follow -up interview.  
Remuneration . Women who complete the telephone interview will receive $[ADDRESS_1216860] or check.  
16.1.5.  Chart audits (after delivery ) 
Participant charts will be reviewed after delivery to abstract delivery approach, delivery mode, 
and other cli nical data ( Appendices 20 and 21 ). Abstraction of delivery outcome data and any 
contraindications to TOLAC before delivery  will be performed by a PI, co -investigator or research 
coordinator who is blinded to the randomization assignment. Other data from th e delivery 
encounter, including maternal and neonatal morbidities and  findings from the cervical exam at 
time of admission , will be abstracted by [CONTACT_941] R C. Data will be collected in REDCap. A comments 
box on the data collection form will allow RCs to document challenges interpreting the chart, 
which can also be raised at a coordinator call or addressed to a co -investigator or PI [INVESTIGATOR_554731].  
Investigator review . For investigator review of outcomes, the delivery note may provide clarity; 
in other cases, review of both the labor and delivery and prenatal record will be necessary. 
Whether the patient developed an absolute contraindication to TOLAC before her delivery 
admission may be obtained from the op note. Breech, Previa, or any congenital anomaly not 
compatible with vaginal delivery should be documented. To establish planned approach for the 
current delivery, the investigator will use the following definitions:  
• Participant planned ERCD  if:  
o Delivered by [CONTACT_871311] 39 weeks prior to labor for no reason other 
than desired RCD rather than TOLAC  
o Presented in labor prior to scheduled cesarean, and opted to proceed with 
cesarean for primary reason that de sired RCD rather than TOLAC  
 
PROCEED Study Protocol………………           - 20- 28 September 2018  
 o Presented with indication for delivery prior to scheduled cesarean 
(preeclampsia, IUGR, NRFT) and opted to proceed with cesarean for primary 
reason that desired RCD rather than TOLAC  
 
Note: If there are t wo indications for RCD in the chart, including a 
nonelective indication for timing of delivery less than [ADDRESS_1216861]  as the "nonelective" indication and  the 
second as ERCD.  
 
• Participant considered TOLAC if:  
o Underwent TOLAC  
o Planned TOLAC if labor prior to certain gestational age, but reached that 
gestational age limit and underwent ERCD  
o Planned TOLAC if spontaneous labor, but then developed an indication for 
induction and underwent ERCD  
16.1.6.  Post -delivery phone interview for outside deliveries (after due date)  
If a participant’s due date has elapsed by [CONTACT_871312], she has likely delivered at an outside institution. In such cases, the RC will 
contact [CONTACT_871313]  a time for the p ost-delivery phone interview. 
During the interview, the participant will be queried for self- report of the date of delivery, 
delivery approach and mode, and other pertinent information such as whether the outside 
facility offers TOLAC, whe ther the woman experienced contractions or rupture of membranes, 
use of pi[INVESTIGATOR_871276], use of forceps or vacuum to assist with delivery, baby’s 
birthweight, maternal weight gain during pregnancy, and other information. In addition, the RC 
will request the name [CONTACT_871328] [CONTACT_871314]. Responses will be collected using the 
post-delivery questionnaire (Appendices 22 and 23) and stored  in a REDCap database  (Appendix 
24).  
17.[ADDRESS_1216862] monthly  conference calls during the period of study 
implementation and additional ad hoc calls will be convened as needed . 
RCs will report all participant complaints to the investigative team.  These will be discussed 
during weekl y/biweekly RC calls and monthly investigator calls.  
Each  study site is responsible for continuous close monitoring and management of adverse 
events (AE) in accordance with the protocol for AE reporting at their home institution 
(Appendices 28-30). The stud y site PIs  are responsible for the initial evaluation and reporting of 
safety information and for alerting the investigative team  if unexpected concerns arise.

Consistent with the secondary study hypothesis that women who are randomized to use the 
Prior Cesarean Decision app will be more likely to have a VBAC compared to women who 
receive only usual care, the following endpoint will be assessed  in the medical record for the 
delivery :  
• Proportion of women who have a VBAC  
Consistent with the secondary study hypothesis that women who are randomized to use the 
Prior Cesarean Decision app will be more knowledgeable about TOLAC and ERCD and their 
potential outcomes compared to women who receive only usual care, the following endpoint 
will be assessed  at weeks 34 - to 37 gestation:  
• Knowledge about TOLAC and ERCD and th eir potential outcomes, as assessed with a  
modified version of a published questionnaire.[ADDRESS_1216864] compared to women who 
receive only usual care, the following endpoint will be assessed  at weeks 34 - to 37 gestation:  
• Decisional conflict regarding delivery approach, as measured based on the participant’s 
score on a well- validated Decisional Conflict S cale33 recommended for the assessment of 
decision quality by [CONTACT_871315].[ADDRESS_1216865] score and 5 
subs cale scores and has been used extensively to evaluate patient- centered decision 
tools in a wide range of clinical contexts.39  
Consistent with the secondary study hypothesis that women who are randomized to use the 
Prior Cesarean Decision app will report higher levels of shared decision making regarding 
delivery approach compared to women who receive only usual care, the following endpoint will 
be assessed  at weeks 34 - to 37 gestation:  
 
PROCEED Study Protocol………………           - 22- 28 September 2018  
 • Shared decision making, as  measured using the SDM -Q-9, a psychometrically evaluated 
self- assessment tool.36  
Consistent with the secondary study hypothesis that women who are randomized to use the 
Prior Cesarean Decision app will experience greater decision self- efficacy compared to women 
who receive only usual care, the following endpoint will be assessed  at weeks 34 - to 37 
gestation:  
• Decision  self-efficacy,  as measured using a validated 11 -item Decisional Self- efficacy 
Scale.34   
Consiste nt with the secondary study hypothesis that women who are randomized to use the 
Prior Cesarean Decision app will report higher levels of decision satisfaction compared to 
women who receive only usual care, the following endpoint will be assessed  at weeks 3 4- to 37 
gestation:  
• Decisional satisfaction, as measured using the Satisfaction with Decision Scale, a [ADDRESS_1216866] for the delivery:  
• Maternal major morbidity , defined as any of: uterine rupture, hysterectomy, surgical 
injury (bowel, bladder/ureter, or other), maternal death.    
• Maternal m inor morbidity , defined as any of: blood transfusion, postpartum febrile 
morbidity (endometritis, cellulitis, urinary tract in fection, or other infection)      
• 3rd or 4th degree lacerations  
• Neonatal death or HIE, defined as any  of: stillbirth/fetal demise (antepartum or 
intrapartum), neonatal death, HIE     
• Neonatal respi[INVESTIGATOR_337446], defined as  any of: respi[INVESTIGATOR_871278]     
• Neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission  
18.2. Sample Size  
Table 1 shows the minimum difference in TOLAC due to the Prior Cesarean Decision  app that has 
80% power . For a recruitment goal of 1,320 participants (1:1 per interve ntion arm) and 
assuming 5% loss to follow -up and a baseline rate of 33% in the control group, we will have at 
least 80% power to detect an 8% absolute increase in TOLAC due to the app.

18.3. Blinding  
Assessors of the primary and secondary outcomes will remain blinded to the randomization 
assignment throughout the study. The s tudy participant and the RC who administers the 
baseline screening and e nrollment interview will be aware of the participant’s ra ndomization 
assignment. Phone follow -up questionnaires and chart audits will be administered by a different 
interviewer and collected in a separate database than the b aseline questionnaire to ensure the 
interviewer remains blinded to the participant’s rand omization assignment during collection of 
study endpoints.  
18.4. Data Analysis  
We will present sample characteristics by [CONTACT_871316] n’s and %’s for 
categorical variables and means/standard deviations or medians and interquartile ranges f or 
continuous variables.  
For our primary outcome TOLAC and major secondary outcome VBAC, we will calculate the 
proportion with the outcome by [CONTACT_871317] a Poisson regression model which has been  adju sted for recruitment site and 
language of interview  and includes robust standard errors. Comparisons will be presented in the 
form of relative risks and 95% confidence intervals. Differences between treatment arms for the 
maternal and neonatal morbidity ou tcomes will be evaluated in the same manner. For 
continuous outcomes (e.g., decisional conflict, shared decision making regarding delivery 
approach, decision self -efficacy, and decisional satisfaction), we will calculate the mean score by 
[CONTACT_871325].  
For our primary outcome TOLAC and major secondary outcome VBAC, we will examine 
interactions of treatment arm by [CONTACT_941] a priori defined factors of site, race/ethnicity, and 
language. For each interaction, differences will be evaluated using a Poisson regression model 
with an interaction term for treatment arm by [CONTACT_6496].  
Analyses will exclude women who had a pregnancy loss before [ADDRESS_1216867] annually and within three months of study termination 
or completion. These reports will include the total number of participants enrolled in the study, 
the numbe r of participants who completed the study, all changes in the research activity, and all 
unanticipated problems involving risks to human subjects or others.  
 
PROCEED Study Protocol………………           - 24- 28 September 2018  
 19.2. Informed Consent  
Written informed consent will be obtained fr om each study participant prior to en rollment using 
an informed consent form approved by [CONTACT_871319]. A copy of her signed informed consent form will be offered to the participant 
(Appendices 7 and 8).  
19.3. HIPAA  
Permission for release of medical rec ords for ascertainment of clinical endp oints will be 
obtained from participant s with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability (HIPAA) 
form, which documents the personal health information that may be released, to whom it may 
be released, how it may be used, when permission for its release expi[INVESTIGATOR_6054], and under what terms 
permission may be cancelled (Appendices 9 and 10).  
19.4. Risks  
Breach of confidentiality . Although study sites will make every effort to protect participant 
privacy and confidentiality, it is possible that participants' involvement in the study could 
become known to others. We are evaluating a mobile health intervention  linked to a cloud 
platform  and there is the possibility that study participation could become known to others 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_797697], password protection, and other security measures.  
19.5. Benefits  
Participation in the intervention arm of this study may lead to improved rates of TOLAC and 
other beneficial outcomes as posited in sections 2.[ADDRESS_1216868] benefits to participants in the control arm of this study; however, they  and others may 
benefit in the future from information learned from this study.  
19.6. Incentives  
Participants will be compensated for their time and effort in this study throu gh remuneration of 
$40 following participation in the baseline interview and $[ADDRESS_1216869] (Appendices 
16 and 17) or check.  
19.7. Confidentiality  
All study -related information will be stored securely at the study site in locked file cabinets or on 
password -protected databases managed in accordance with section 9.1.3. of this study protocol . 
Participant study information will not be released without the writte n permission of the 
participant except as necessary for monitoring by [CONTACT_100432]/or the site IRB.

20.1.3.   Database Management and Data Quality Monitoring  
Randomization assignment, surve y responses, and chart audit data for all sites will be collected 
and stored in REDCap databases hosted centrally at UCSF . Data will be behind an institutional 
firewall and accessible through a web portal via login credentials known only to qualified study  
staff. Randomization assignment will be collected in a separate database than the p hone follow -
up questionnaire and chart audits to ensure staff remain blinded to treatment group while 
gathering outcome data. Sites will maintain their own tracking and rec ruitment logs in local 
REDCap databases (Appendix 24). Protected health information , such as patient names, medical 
record number, estimated due date, clinic visit schedule, telephone number and email address 
will be collected on the tracking and recruitme nt log to aid with scheduling and participant 
follow -up. A unique study identifier will be generated for each participant to link records across 
databases.  
Data from the app will be collected through a secure, password -protected online portal linked to 
a PostGRE SQL database on a Heroku cloud platform, which provides best -in-class server 
security, including firewalls, physical security, and regular compliance  auditing.

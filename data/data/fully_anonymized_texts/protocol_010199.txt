PROTOCOL  SYNOPSIS  
Trial  Title: Efficacy and Safety of gadopi[INVESTIGATOR_555332] (CNS)  Magnetic 
Resonance Imaging (MRI)   
Phase III Clinical Trial  
Trial  Product(s):  G03277 Active Ingredient(s):  gadopi[INVESTIGATOR_555333].:  2018 -003988 -54 IND No.:  123673  
Potential Participating countries (Potential Number of sites):  
Worldwide trial involving approximately 40 site s. 
Trial  Objectives  
As the trial is a multi -regional one, trial objectives are presented to meet with the respective 
regulatory authorities’ submission purpose.  
Primary objective  1:  
o To demonstrate the superiority  of gadopi[INVESTIGATOR_555334]- enhanced MRI at 0.05 mmol/kg  body 
weight (BW) compared to unenhanced MRI for patien t referred for contrast- enhanced MRI 
of CNS, in terms of 3 lesion visualization  co-primary criteria ( border delineation, internal 
morphology and degree of contrast enhancement) using the patient as his/her own control. 
Primary objective  2: 
o To demonstrate the non- inferiority of gadopi[INVESTIGATOR_555335] 0.05 mmol/kg compared to 
gadobutrol at 0.1 mmol/kg in terms of 3 lesion visualization co-primary criteria (border 
delineation, internal morphology, degree of contrast enhancement ) for patient referred fo r 
contrast- enhanced MRI of CNS .  
For FDA , the primary objective 1 is to be achieved. The primary objective 2 will serve as one of the 
secondary objectives.  
For EMA, both primary objectives 1 and 2 are to be achieved. 
Secondary objectives: 
o To demonstrate the non- inferiority of gadopi[INVESTIGATOR_555336]  3 
lesion visualization co -primary criteria (border delineation, internal morphology, degree of 
contrast enhancement) for patient referred for contrast- enhanced MRI of CNS  (for FDA 
only). 
o To assess the following parameters with gadopi[INVESTIGATOR_555337]  
 lesion visualization assessment by [CONTACT_1697]  
 Improvement in lesion visualization scores  at patient -level  
 Technical adequacy of images 
 Number, size and location of lesions  
 Diagnostic confidence 
 Impact  of contrast-enhanced MRI on patient treatment plan  
 Contrast to Noise Ratio (CNR)

 Percentage enhancement (E%) of lesion(s)  
 Lesion to Background Ratio (LBR)  
 Overall diagnostic preference  
o To assess the safety profile of gadopi[INVESTIGATOR_555338] s a prospective, multi- center, randomized, double -blind, controlled and cross -over 
design . 
The Investigational Medicinal Products (IMPs) used during the trial are gadopi[INVESTIGATOR_555339]. 
The p rimary criteria  1 will compare gadopi[INVESTIGATOR_555334] -enhanced MRI (pre + post images = paired 
images) to unenhanced MRI (pre images), using the patient as h is/her own control.  
The primary criteria  2 will compare gadopi[INVESTIGATOR_555334] -enhanced MRI (paired images) to gadobutrol -
enhanced MRI (paired images).  
Patients, once informed consent form (ICF) signed, will perform a screening visit (V1) to confirm 
trial eligibility, then will be randomized in the trial to determ ine the order of IMP injection. Each of 
the 2 MRI visits  (V2 and V4)  will be followed by a safety visit (V3 and V5) performed 1 day after 
the MRI visit.  
Two MRIs will be obtained for each patient: gadopi[INVESTIGATOR_555334]- enhanced MRI and gadobutrol -enhanced 
MRI (see Figure 1) , however the nature of the contrast agent s injected at V isit 2 and at Visit 4 will 
be randomly assigned by [CONTACT_53177] ( IWRS ). 
The investigator and the patient will remain blinded to IMPs allocation (nature of the IMPs and 
order of the IMP injection). A designated unblinded site staff member will be in charge of 
preparation and administration of the IMPs. 
The randomization scheme will allocate patient s in a 1:[ADDRESS_729060] experienced in 
MRI of CNS  will be appointed at the start of the trial to read all images of  patients included at the 
site (on-site read) . 
In addition, images will be evaluated by [CONTACT_555421] a 
centralized manner. All images will be sent to a core  laboratory, which  will prepare the images for 
evaluation. 
The blinded image evaluations (off-site read) will be performed by 3 independent blinded 
radiologists for the reading of random images and by 3 additional independent blinded radiologists 
for the g lobal pairs assessment . An imaging electronic Case Report Form (eCRF ) will be used to 
ensure that the images are properly aligned and to ensure that all necessary data for the trial purpose 
are documented by [CONTACT_555422].  
To allow exact matching of lesions between imaging modalities (Pre  and Paired), between the two 
MR examinations with gadopi[INVESTIGATOR_555337], and among [ADDRESS_729061] (lesion tracker) will perform lesion tracking, separate from the image evaluation by [CONTACT_555423].

Version No. V1.0 
December 20,  2018 Page 6 / 79 
 
 
- One screening visit (V1) up to 7 days prior to inclusion ( V1 could be done on the same day 
as the randomization visit  (V2) if all the inclusion/non-inclusion criteria are met).  
- Two sequential imaging visits (V2 and V4, minimum interval 2 days and up to 14 days): 
each visit will consist of gadopi[INVESTIGATOR_555341] .  
- Two safety visits (V3 and V5): [ADDRESS_729070] been reviewed by [CONTACT_555425]. The patient’s participation is defined as the period from the screening visit (ICF sig nature) to the last trial visit.  
Evaluation criteria  
Primary criteria 1 : 
o Lesion visualization (based on 3 co- primary criteria: border delineation, internal 
morphology and degree of contrast enhancement) will be assessed by 3 independent off -site 
blinded r eaders on Paired (pre+post) images versus Pre images for gadopi[INVESTIGATOR_555342] a 4-
point scale (off-site read)  
Primary criteria 2  (for EMA, secondary criteria for FDA) : 
o Lesion visualization (based on 3 co- primary criteria: border delineation, internal 
morphology and degree of contrast enhancement) will be assessed by 3 independent off -site 
blinded readers on Paired (pre+post) images for gadopi[INVESTIGATOR_555343] a 4 -point scale (off -site read).  
The evaluation for  the primary criteria will be performed f or up to the [ADDRESS_729071] enhancing lesions should be 
prioritized.  
The 3 co-primary criteria  (border delineation, internal morphology and degree of contrast 
enhancement) will be assessed  and the mean  of scores for each of the 3 co-primary criteria will be 
calculated as follows:  
Mean  of scores = score of the lesion 1 + score of the lesion 2 (if a ny) + score of the lesion 3 (if 
any)) divided by [CONTACT_555426] (up to [ADDRESS_729072] representative lesions).  
 
For each reader, only matching lesion between Paired images and Pre images will be considered for 
the purpose of the primary criteria [ADDRESS_729073], if the MR images are not assessable or if no matching lesion between 
Paired images of gadopi[INVESTIGATOR_555344], then the patient will not be included in 
the primary criteria 2 evaluation.  
 The mean of scores for each of the lesion visualization co - primary criteria and for each reader will 
range from 1 to 4. 
 
Secondary criteria :

December 20,  2018 Page 7 / 79 
 
 
The following parameters will be evaluated  with gadopi[INVESTIGATOR_555337] :  
o Same as primary criteria 2, lesion visualization (based on 3 co- primary criteria: border 
delineation, internal morphology and degree of contrast enhancement) for gadopi[INVESTIGATOR_555345] (off-site read)  (For FDA only) . 
o Improvement in lesion visualization scores  at patie nt-level : a comparison of paired images 
to pre images with respect to the proportion of patients who have paired image scores that 
are greater ( “better”) , or same/worse ( “not better” ) than the pre images. 
o Lesion visualization (based on 3 co- primary criteria: border delineation, internal 
morphology and degree of contrast enhancement) (on -site read)   
o Technical adequacy of images (on- site and off -site read)  
Images will be evaluated as technically adequate for diagnosis and assessable or not . 
o Number, size and location of lesions (on- site and off -site read)  
Number, size an d location of lesions detected will be recorded  for each patient . 
o Diagnostic confidence (on -site and off -site read)  
Degree of confidence will be assessed using a [ADDRESS_729074]-enhanced MRI on patient treatment plan (on- site read)  
Assessment of potential i mpact of on- site images reading, at V2 and V4, on  patient 
treatment plan.  
The 3 quantitative criteria (CNR, E% , LBR)  will be  calculated by [CONTACT_555427] [ADDRESS_729075] representative lesions (off-site read).  
o Contrast to Noise ratio (CNR)  
𝐶𝑁𝑅 =  𝑆𝐼𝑙𝑒𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛− 𝑆𝐼ℎ𝑡
𝑆𝐷𝑛𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑒 
where  SIlesion = Signal intensity of lesion . 
SIht = Signal intensity of healthy tissue (brain or spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831]). 
SD noise = Standard D eviation (SD) of background noise. 
o Percentage enhancement  (E%) of lesion (s) (off-site read) . 
𝐸% =  𝑆𝐼𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡− 𝑆𝐼𝑝𝑟𝑒
𝑆𝐼𝑝𝑟𝑒x100  
where  SIpost = Signal intensity  of lesion  on post  injection image s. 
SIpre = Signal intensity  of lesion on pre injection images. 
o Lesion to Background Ratio (LBR)  (pre and post)   
LBR  =𝑆𝐼𝑙𝑒𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛
𝑆𝐼𝑏 
where  SIlesion = Signal intensity of lesion . 
SIb= Signal intensity of background (healthy tissue  in brain or spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831]). 
o Overall diagnostic preference (off -site read)  
The evaluation will be performed in a global matched -pairs fashion and preference will be 
determined on a 3-point scale. Reason for preference will also be recorded.  
o Safety profile of gadopi[INVESTIGATOR_555346] (AEs) , the results of

vital signs  measurement , the injection site tolerance  evaluation and  the clinical laboratory 
parameters (blood  samples ). 
Statistical methods  
Primary objective 1 (superiority of Paired  images versus Pre images of gadopi[INVESTIGATOR_555347] -primary criteria ) 
For gadopi[INVESTIGATOR_555334] , the difference “Paired” - ”Pre” for e ach of [ADDRESS_729076] to meet the alternative hypothesis for the three co-
primary criteria in the gadopi[INVESTIGATOR_555348]: a statistically significant (one -sided p≥0.025) positive 
difference in mean score s in border delineation, internal morphology and degree of contrast 
enhancement of lesions simultaneously. 
Sample size assessment for the Primary objective 1:  
Expecting that for ea ch co -primary criteria, the difference in mean scores will be 0.35, Gutierrez et 
al. 2015, ([“Paired” – “Pre”] within patient mean of lesion scores) with 1.[ADDRESS_729077] 90% power when using a single group 
superiority t -test with a 0.025 one- sided significance level.  
As 20% drop- out rate is expected, sample size increases to 250 patients with CNS lesions. 
 
Primary objective  2 non-inferiority of gadopi[INVESTIGATOR_555349] -primary criteria ): 
The Student’s t -based two-sided 95% confidence inte rvals of the difference between gadopi[INVESTIGATOR_555350] [ADDRESS_729078] 2 out  of 3 readers and for the 3 co -primary criteria  simultaneously , then non- inferiority 
between gadopi[INVESTIGATOR_555351].  
As soon as the non- inferiority is demonstrated, the superiority of the gadopi[INVESTIGATOR_555352]. No adjustment for multiplicity is needed as it is a simple 
closed testing procedure.  
Sample size for the primary objective 2:  
o Non-inferiority margin:  
For EMA, both primary objectives [ADDRESS_729079] demonstration of the superiority of Paired images with gadopi[INVESTIGATOR_555353] (objective 1). So, it can be considered as three -armed trial d
esign with unenhanced images as 
placebo as described in EMA  guideline on the choice of the non- inferiority margin . As such, it is not 
necessary to define a value for non -inferiority margin to establish that gadopi[INVESTIGATOR_555354].  
A 10% non- inferiority margin was considered clinically as an unimportant difference and therefore 
relevant to establish acceptable efficacy relative to gadobutrol (objective 2). Based on the Guerbet 
Phase IIb GDX -44-004 clinical trial results on lesion v isualization co -criteria, the mean score for 
each of the 3 co -criteria is expected to be equal to 3.5. So the margin is set to 0.35 (10%).  
o Sample size hypothesis: 
An enrollment of 200 patients is deemed necessary for the lower limit of the 95% CI to exceed  the 
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Protocol No. GDX -44-010 
Version No. V1.0 
December 20,  2018 Page 9 / 79 
 
 
non-inferiority margin set to 0.35, assuming 80% power and for each co -primary criterion, the 
expected difference in mean scores is [ADDRESS_729080] deviation of 1.75.  
If one assumed a patient drop -out rate of 20%, a minimum enrollment of 250 patients with CNS 
lesions is planned.  
Therefore, a total number of 250 patients will allow a sufficient power to meet both objectives.

(1) V1 can be performed on the same day as V2. MRI procedures , at V2 and V 4, should be performed on the same day as IWRS connection and contrast  agent 
injection .  
(2) Physical examination should be performed by a physician: examination of general appearance, skin, neck (including thyroi d), eyes, ears, nose, throat, lungs, 
heart, abdomen, back, lymph nodes, extremities, vascular and neurological. Information indicating the global assessment (norm al or abnormal (specify)) of the 
physical examination should be recorded on source documentati on. 
(3) Urine pregnancy test (if applicable) is to be done on site. At V2 and V4, results must be available prior to IWRS connection and administration of IMP . In case 
V1 and V2 are performed on the same day, only one pregnancy test is required.  
(4) At V2 and V4, e GFR is to be evaluated locally, and results must be available prior to IWRS connection and administration of IMP.  Starting at V3, change in 
local serum creatinine result should be checked as per ESUR guidelines (see section  7.2.10) . The same local methods of serum creatinine dosage and eGFR 
calculation should be used throughout the trial  for a same patient.  
(5) Clinical laboratory parameters will be analysed by [CONTACT_27671]:  haematology and biochemistry , see section  8.5 for details  
(6) Vital signs: BP: blood pressure (supi[INVESTIGATOR_555355] ), PR: Pulse  Rate 
(7) IWRS: connection should be done at each trial visit and in case of screening failure or premature d iscontinuation  
(8) Injection -site tolerance (pain, eruption, extravasation, inflammation, or other)  is to be  assessed during the injection, 60  ± [ADDRESS_729082] injection.  
(9) AEs occurring during the time of the patient’s participation in the trial, must be reported and followed, unless they meet the following definition: the events 
which occur before the first IMP administration, and which are not serious and  not related to the trial procedures can  be recorded as medical history upon the 
investigat or’s judgement.  Procedures/therapeutic measures for AE are also to be reported . 
(10) All the assessments performed prior to the first MRI at V2 will be considered as baseline value. 
(11) Some non -inclusion criteria must be checked again at V4 (see section 4.2). 
(12) In case brain metastasis is the trial disease, the corresponding  primary cancer  will be reported in medical history

chelating agent. They can be categorized by [CONTACT_555428] (ionic or non-ionic). In vitro  experiments have shown 
that the macrocyclic compounds are the most stable, with an undetectable re lease of Gd3+ ions under 
physiological conditions. 
Gadopi[INVESTIGATOR_555334] (P03277) is a new chemical entity discovered and developed by [CONTACT_555429]. It is a non-
ionic macrocyclic gadolinium (Gd) complex, of high kinetic stability, intended to be used in human, 
by [CONTACT_33980] (IV) administration, as a contrast agent for M agnetic R esonance I maging (MRI).  
The ability of gadopi[INVESTIGATOR_555359] a MRI contrast agent has been demonstrated by [CONTACT_555430] -fold 
higher T1 relaxivity compared to other available Gd -based contrast ag ents (GBCA). A proof of 
concept has been obtained for the efficacy of gadopi[INVESTIGATOR_555360] a MRI contrast agent for central nervous 
system (CNS) imaging in a model of brain tumor implanted in rats as well as during the phase IIa clinical trial. The safe and lowest effective clinical dose identified in phase IIb trial is  0.05 mmol/kg 
body weight (BW) based on comparison with gadobenate dimeglumine (MultiHance
®) for the 
contrast- to-noise ratio (CNR) assessed as primary endpoint.  
One phase I/IIa trial and one phase IIb trial have been completed, with 304 patient s exposed to 
gadopi[INVESTIGATOR_555334]. On the basis of the extensive nonclinical study program and the PK/ clinical safety data available from 
phase I/IIa and phase IIb trials , it is  considered that there are sufficient guarantees to ensure the safety 
of gadopi[INVESTIGATOR_555361] (from 2 to 17 years) patients at a single dose .  
 
At the launch of the phase III program and based on the initial clinical studies, the administrations of 
the gadopi[INVESTIGATOR_555362]. More details on the safety are provided in the investigator’s 
brochure in force that is the reference safety information for the gadopi[INVESTIGATOR_555334]. Likewise, the SmPC is

1.[ADDRESS_729102] been used extensively in a large range of indications, particularly MRI  
examinations of Central Nervous System (CNS). Contrast enhancement has enabled improving tissue 
contrast and lesion characterization and more sensitive detection of even very small lesions. Contrast -
enhanced MRI of brain lesions also plays a vital role during the post -therapeutic or in tervention phase 
in determining treatment response: ea rly identification of the lack of treatment efficacy can facilitate 
selection of an alternative therapeutic approach, potentially improving patient  outcomes 
Pathologies of the CNS represent the most important indication in MR I. It is a well -established 
technique and more than 50% of CNS MR examinations are performed after intravenous (IV) injection 
of a GBCA. For MR Imaging of CNS , the GBCAs already commercialized exhibit a range of r1 and r2 
relaxivi ty values providing their efficacy at a clinical dose at 0.1 mmol/kg  BW. Optimal detection and 
characterization of CNS lesions on contrast -enhanced T1- weighted MR imaging depends as much on 
the contrast agent used as on the sequence parameters applied for image acquisition. The increased R1 
relaxivity leads to increased signal intensity enhancement and thus significantly improved lesion 
visualization and better depi[INVESTIGATOR_555363] [1-8]. High relaxivity 
GBCA may potentially enable earlier detection of small cerebral  or spi[INVESTIGATOR_158444], or detect more 
tiny lesions which may be overlooked by [CONTACT_555431].

3 TRIAL  DESCRIPTION 
3.1 Protocol Design  
The trial ha s a prospective, multi- center, randomized, double -blind, controlled and cross- over design . 
The IMPs used during the trial are gadopi[INVESTIGATOR_555368]. 
The primary criteria  1 will compare gadopi[INVESTIGATOR_555334]- enhanced MRI (pre + post images = paired ima ges) 
to unenhanced MRI (pre images), using the patient as h is/her own control.  
The primary criteria  2 will compare gadopi[INVESTIGATOR_555334] -enhanced MRI (paired images) to gadobutrol -
enhanced MRI (paired images).  
Patients, once informed consent form (ICF) signed, will  perform a screening visit (V1) to confirm trial 
eligibility, then will be randomized in the trial to determine the order of IMP injection. Each of the 2 
MRI visits (V2 and V4)  will be followed by a safety visit (V3 and V5) performed 1 day after the MRI 
visit. 
Two MRIs will be obtained for each patient: gadopi[INVESTIGATOR_555369] l-enhanced MRI and gadobutrol -enhanced 
MRI (see Figure 1) , however the nature of the contrast agent s injected at V isit 2 and at Visit 4 will be 
randomly assigned by [CONTACT_10966]. 
The investigator and the patient will remain blinded to IMPs allocation (nature of the IMPs and order 
of the IMP injection). A designated unblinded site staff member will be in charge of preparation and 
administration of the IMPs.  
The randomization scheme will allocate patient s in a 1:[ADDRESS_729103] experienced in 
MRI of CNS will be appointed at the start of the trial to read all images of  patients included at the site  
(on-site read). 
In addition, images will be evaluated by [CONTACT_555421] a centralized 
manner. All images will be sent to a core laboratory, which  will prepare the images for evaluation.  
The blinded image evaluations (off-site read) will be performed by 3 independent blinded radiologists 
for the reading of random images reading and by 3 additional independent blinded radiologists for the 
global pairs assessment. An imaging electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) will be used to ensure that  
the images are properly aligned and to ensure that all necessary data for the trial purpose are documented by [CONTACT_555422]. 
To allow exact matching of lesions between imaging modalities (Pr e and Paired), between the two MR 
examinations with gadopi[INVESTIGATOR_555337], and among [ADDRESS_729104] 
(lesion tracker) will perform lesion tracking, separate from the image evaluations. by [CONTACT_555432].   
The IWRS  will be used to randomize order of contrast agents to be injected, to allocate IMPs, to 
calculate the volume of IMP to be administered based on the body weight and to record patient ’s 
visits . 
During the trial, the safety will be monitored and assessed based on the reporting of adv erse events 
(AEs) , the results of vital signs  measurement , the injection site tolerance  evaluation and the clinical 
laboratory parameters (blood  samples).

3.2 Justification for dose  
Based on Phase IIb results, gadopi[INVESTIGATOR_555370] 0.05mmol/kg BW, is deemed to be as efficient as all 
other available GBCAs at  clinical dose of 0.1mmol/kg BW. It will be investigated for diagnos tic 
efficacy  in terms of lesion visualization  in patients with CNS pathologies.  
Gadobutrol will be used, as an active  comparator, at its standard approved dose of 0.1 mmol/kg BW. 
3.3 Trial  Duration 
3.3.1 Duration of patient ’s participation  
Minimum trial duration for patient s: 4 days (if V1 and V2 done on the same day ) and the second MRI 
is done [ADDRESS_729105] one. 
Maximum trial duration for patients: [ADDRESS_729106] one.  The trial includes a maximum of 5 visits: 
- One screening visit (V1) up to 7 days prior to inclusion ( V1 could be done on the same day as 
the randomization  visit  (V2)  if all the inclusion/non-inclusion criteria are met).  
- Two sequential imaging visits (V2 and V4, minimum interval 2 days and up to 14 days): each 
visit will consist of a gadopi[INVESTIGATOR_555371].

In case of issue related to  IMP (damaged, broken vials…) , a new IMP will be allocated to the p atient 
via the IWRS.  
All IMPs will be stored in a secure place, under the responsibility of the Investigator or other 
authorized individuals. The IMPs should be stored at a temperature of 25°C or below in the original 
package, protected from light and not frozen. 
At the time of the trial completion, all used (including empty vials) and unused IMPs should have been 
returned to Guerbet  or to the predefined location for storage before destruction. 
 
5.[ADDRESS_729121](s) Allocation / Randomization  
At visit 2, the patients will be randomly assigned to one series of 2 MRIs performed each at two trial visits separated by a wash out period of 2 days minimum  and up to 14 days. One series consists of t he 
use of gadopi[INVESTIGATOR_555334], single intravenous (IV) bolus injection, as contrast agent at visit 2  and gadobutrol, 
single intravenous (IV) bolus injection, at visit 4  and reverse order for the second series  (see Figure 
1). 
The randomization scheme will allocate patients in a 1:[ADDRESS_729122] to document in 
a separated patient’s file all the unblinded information related to the IMPs and will have to complete 
dedicated restricted field in clinical eCRF pages. 
During the course of the trial, the two teams should not exchange any information regarding the IMPs (nature of IMP injected , order of administration,). The patients’ files with unblinded data should not be

Version No. V1.0 
December 20,  2018 Page 31 / 79 
 
 
filed with the patient’s medical and trial files in order to not break the blind.  The unblinded 
documentation should be stored shielded from the view of the blinded staff. An initial shipment of 
IMPs will b e sent to the investigational sites  after having received regulatory authorization(s)/ethical 
approval(s) as per local requirements. Additional shipments will be sent according to patient  
recruitment progress of a given investigational site. The site shoul d ensure to have enough IMPs 
before including a new patient. The site can log onto IWRS to know the IMPs stock status. 
IMP receipt will be acknowledged by [CONTACT_093] (or any designated person in his/her team) via 
IWRS.  
At visit 2 and visit 4, once  all the inclusion /non- inclusion criteria, including eGFR and pregnancy test 
have been checked, the site should log onto the IWRS which will allocate IMP (s) number available at 
the site . This/these IMP(s) will  correspond to the allocated treatment  arm and t o the contrast  medium 
allocated for the enhanced MRI procedure.  
In case one IMP breaks or becomes non -sterile or is not available,  or any  problem of IMP allocation 
(e.g. wrong IMP administered to the patient ), the site must immediately report the incident into IWRS 
and to Guerbet’s  representative in order to ensure that all corrective action s are taken . Corrective 
actions may include transferring the IMP to quarantine to prevent fur ther IMP allocation by [CONTACT_555435]. Detailed instructions can be found in the IWRS manual 
provided to the sites.  
 
5.3.2 Double- Blind  Conditions   
To ensure that administration of the IMP is carried out under double -blind conditions, an unblinded 
team  (nurse, technician or physician) will be responsible for preparing and administrating the IMP(s). 
This person will ensure non -disclosure of information .  He /she will stick the detachable label of the 
vial into the Patient ’s records or appropriate form. He /she will also write his/her name, date and 
signature [CONTACT_555502], and after use, he/she will close the box with a seal. 
Any dis closure relating to the nature of the contrast agent injected by [CONTACT_555436] a protocol deviation. 
Image readings of all patients will be evaluated in blinded conditions regarding the contrast agent 
injected, as described in Section  8.4. 
 
5.3.3 Individual Trial  Treatment  Unblinding  
In case of an adverse event occurring for a patient and which nature would require immediate 
knowledge of the allocated IMP, the individual trial treatment may be unblinded, if absolutely 
necessary for the safety of the patients and if unblinding impacts the management o f medical cares 
(see section  9.5).  
Conditions and procedure for breaking the code will be reviewed with the investigator and his/her team during the initiation visit.  
The persons authorized to unblind trial product during t he trial usually are: the investigators and 
Guerbet Pharmacovigilance physician/officer  and European Qualified Person for Pharmacovigilance  
(EU-QPPV) .   
If the Clinical Project Manager receives an external request for unblinding (Authorities, health care professionals taking care of the patient, etc.), he/she must inform Guerbet Pharmacovigilance 
physician/officer.  
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Protocol No. GDX -44-010 
Version No. V1.0 
December 20,  2018 Page 32 / 79 
 
 
If the investigator and Guerbet Pharmacovigilance physician/officer unblind the trial product  via the 
IWRS , he/she must inform the Clinical Project Manager as soon as possible but shall not reveal the 
nature of the trial product in order to protect as much as possible the double- blind design of the trial.  
Unblinding must be documented by [CONTACT_555437]’s identification number, age and sex , the 
date, time and the reason for unblinding, the identity of the person who performed the unblinding.  
Please refer to Section 9.[ADDRESS_729123], or other personnel allowed to store and dispense IMP (s) is 
responsible for ensuring that the IMP used in the clinical trial is securely maintained as specified by 
[CONTACT_555438].  
Any quality issue noticed with the receipt or use of an IMP (deficient IMP in condition, appearance, 
pertaining documentation, labeling, expi[INVESTIGATOR_5695], etc.) should be promptly notified to Guerbet , who will 
initiate a complaint procedure. 
Under no circumstances shall the investigator supply IMP to a third party, allow s the IMP to be used 
other than as directed by [CONTACT_555439], or dispose of IMP in any other manner.

5.[ADDRESS_729125] (s) Compliance and Accountability  
An unblinded third party, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_98341], or other allowed personnel , designated by [CONTACT_1275], will keep accurate records of IMPs  accountability at site level as well as accurate records 
of the batch numbers and quantities of the IMP given to each patient .  
The dosing information will be recorded in individual patient ’s records. When protocol required IMP 
administration conditions are not followed, reason(s) will be given and recorded by [CONTACT_555440]’ source document and clinical eCRF . 
The volume (mL) of IMP to be injected to the patients will be determined by [CONTACT_10966]. The volume will 
be automatically rounded by [CONTACT_555441]: 
• If decimal is  < 0.5, volume is rounded to the inferior value (e.g.: from 15.4 mL to 15 mL) 
• If decimal is  ≥ 0.5, volume is rounded to the superior value (e.g.: from 15.8 mL to 16 mL)

7.1 Primary Criteri a (off-site read)  
7.1.1 Primary criteria 1 : lesion  visualization criteria for gadopi[INVESTIGATOR_555334]- enhanced MRI  
compared to unenhanced MRI (off- site read)  
The l esion visualization criteria is based on 3 co- primary criteria: border delineation, internal 
morphology and degree of contrast enhancement , assessed  on the images acquired during the MRI 
performed with gadopi[INVESTIGATOR_555334]. 
The IBR will record each of the [ADDRESS_729129] enhancing lesions should be prioritized. 
The evaluation will be performed on Pair ed images ( images set 1b) versus Pre images (images set 1a) 
using a 4 -point scale as described below : 
o Border delineation:  
Delineation of the lesion border is defined as the distinction of lesion from surrounding tissues, 
structures, or edema; and the detection of extent of the lesion (for extra -axial lesions, this pertains to 
the definition of the space in which the lesion is present, and for intra -axial lesions, it pertains to the 
invasion of white matter, gray matter, or both; the neuroanatomical distribution of the lesion; and its mass effect). This criterion will be assessed through the following scale:  
1 = none: no or unclear delineation 2 = moderate: some areas of clear delineation but also with some significant areas of 
non-distinct delineation  
3 = good: almost clear but not complete delineation 
4 = e xcellent: border outline is sharp with clear and complete delineation  
 
o Internal morphology:  
Internal morphology of the lesion includes an identification of lesion architecture and the intra -lesion 
featu res such as necrosis, hemorrhage and vascularity. This criterion will be assessed through the 
following scale: 
1 = poor: poorly seen 2 = moderate: majority of lesion is poorly seen but with minor parts of lesion visible 
3 = good: majority of lesion is clearly seen but with minor parts of lesion invisible 
4 = excellent: lesion is well seen and can see “through” lesion to observe any complex  
areas of necrosis or hemorrhage or cyst formation  
 
o Degree of contrast enhancement:  
This criterion will be a qualitative assessment (not based on signal intensity measurement) according 
to the following scale:  
1 = no: no enhancement  
2 = moderate: weakly enhanced  
3 = good: clearly enhanced 4 = excellent: clearly and brightly enhanced  
 
The mean  of scores for each of the 3 lesion visualization co- criteria will be calculated as follows:  
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Protocol No. GDX -44-010 
Version No. V1.0 
December 20,  2018 Page 36 / 79 
 
 
 Mean  of scores = score of lesion 1 + score of lesion 2  (if any) + score of lesion 3 (if any ) 
divided by [CONTACT_555426] (up to [ADDRESS_729130] representative lesions) .  
For each reader, only matching lesion between paired images and pre images will be considered for 
the purpose of the primary criteria 1 evaluation.  
For each reader, if the MR images are not assessable or if no matching lesion is identified betw een 
Paired images and Pre images, then the patient will not be included in the primary criteria 1 evaluation. 
The mean of scores for each of the lesion visualization co - primary criteria 1 will range from 1 to 4.  
 
7.1.2 Primary criteria 2: Lesion visualization criteria for gadopi[INVESTIGATOR_555379] (off- site read).  
Same as primary criteria  1, the lesion visualization criteria is based on 3 co- primary criteria: border 
delineation, internal morphology and degree of contrast enhancement assessed on the images acquired 
during the MRI performed with gadopi[INVESTIGATOR_555380]. 
The IBR will record each of the [ADDRESS_729131] representative lesions, on Paired 
images ( images set 1b ) performed with gadopi[INVESTIGATOR_555381] ( images set  2b) performed 
with gadobutrol using a 4- point scale .  
Definitions of each co -primary criteria  and score calculation are provided in section  7.1.1.  
For each reader, only matching lesion between paired images of gadobutrol and gadopi[INVESTIGATOR_555382] 2 evaluation.  
For each reader, if the MR images are not assessable or if no matching lesion is identified on paired 
images between gadopi[INVESTIGATOR_555337], then the patient will not be included in the primary 
criteria 2 evaluation.  
The mean of scores for each of the lesion visualization co - primary criteria 1 will range from 1 to 4. 
 
7.2 Secondary Criteria  
All secondary criteria will be evaluated for gadopi[INVESTIGATOR_555337]. 
7.2.1 Lesion vi sualization  criteria for gadopi[INVESTIGATOR_555357] (off-site 
read) for FDA only. 
The criteria is the same as described in section 7.1.2. 
 
7.2.[ADDRESS_729132] images  
Improvement in lesion visualization scores at patient- level is based on 3 co- primary criteria:  border 
delineation, internal morphology and degree of contrast enhancement assessed on the images acquired during the MRI performed with gadopi[INVESTIGATOR_555337]. 
For each contrast agent on Pre and Paired images and for the 3 co -primary criteria, the l esion score is 
calculated and compared between Pre and Paired images. If the lesion score of Paired images is greater 
than those of Pre images then the Paired image will be classified as “Better”. If the mean score of 
Paired images is equal or less than those of Pre images then the Paired image will be classified as “Not Better”.

7.2.3 Lesion visualization  (on-site read)  
The l esion visualization criteria is based on 3 co- criteria: border delineation, internal morphology and 
degree of contrast enhancement  assessed on the images acquired during the MRI performed with 
gadopi[INVESTIGATOR_555337]. 
The investigator (radiologist)  will record each of the [ADDRESS_729133] 
representative lesions, on Pre and Paired images (images set 1a, 2a, 1 b, and 2b) using a 4 -point scale. 
The 3 co- criteria definition are listed in section 7.1.1  
 
7.2.4 Technical adequacy of images (on-site and off- site read)  
For each contrast agent , images will be evaluated as technically adequate for diagnosis using a 4-point 
scales and as assessable or not  by [CONTACT_555443] .  
The technical adequacy of images will be rated on a 4 point scales:  
1 = non diagnostic 
2 = poor 
3 = fair  
4 = good  
Images should be evaluated as assessable or not and if not, the reason should be recorded:  
1 = Artifacts due to patient   
2 = Artifacts due to machine 
3 = Injection technical failure 
4 = Inadequate anatomic coverage  
5= Other, specify  
 
7.2.5 Number, size and location  of lesions (on- site and off -site read)  
The investigator and IBR  is to record the following:  
- Number of lesions on pre and paired images 
- For the [ADDRESS_729134] representative lesions, the following will be recorded for each lesion  separately:   
 The largest diameter of the lesion  
 The location of the lesion  
- In case that more than 3 lesions are present, the investigator/ IBR has to enter in 
the clinical/imaging  eCRF how many lesions are present  (total number)   
 
7.2.6 Diagnostic confidence (on-site and off- site read)  
The investigator/IBR  will record in the clinical/imaging eCRF his/her diagnosis and his/her confidence 
in diagnosis for each patient for each pre and paired images of each contrast agent according to the Table 4 .

The impact on patient  treatment plan will be assessed by [INVESTIGATOR_2394] -site radiologists and will be summarized 
for each contrast agent . At the end of visit 2 and at the end of visit 4, after having completed all the 
sequences of images required by [CONTACT_760] (images set  1b or set  2b), the investigator will have to 
document if the patient ’s treatment plan could have been changed based on the images obtained 
(yes/no) and if yes, he/she would have to specify  the therapeutic management proposed based on 
radiological assessment:  
- Surgery  
- Biopsy 
- Chemotherapy 
- Radiotherapy

7.2.9 Overall diagnostic preference (off- site read).  
The evaluation will be performed in a global matched -pairs fashion (image s set 1b and 2b). For each 
randomized patient , all images ( paired image set 1b or 2b ) from the first MR examination, labeled as 
examination 1, will be displayed simultaneously with the corresponding paired images from the 
second MR examination, labeled as examination 2.  
The assessment will be performed on all pos t-contrast T1- weighted images with 3-point scales: 
o 1: when  examination 1 is preferred to examination 2  
o 0: when  no preference is observed  
o 2: when  examination [ADDRESS_729138] one or more of the following six reasons for this preference:  
• Contrast enhancement was superior  
• Delineation of normal structure was better  
• Delineation of at least one lesion was better  
• Internal structure of lesions was better visualized  
• More lesions were identified  
• Diagnostic confidence was greater (specify one or more reason(s): detection of 
lesions, characterization of disease, assignment of a grade to disease (i.e., high or 
low grade in the case of intraaxial gliomas), definition of extent of disease, or 
other reasons that had to be specified on the imaging eCRF)

7.2.10 Safety profile of gadopi[INVESTIGATOR_555337] (on -site).  
The safety assessments will be followed up by [CONTACT_555445], injection site tolerance, 
clinical laboratory parameters (blood s amples) and adverse events (AEs) reporting . 
o Vital signs  
Vital signs (supi[INVESTIGATOR_555384], pulse rate) will be measured and recorded 
according to the following schedules: 
 Prior to each contrast agent injection (V2 is considered as baseline value)    
 At 60  ± [ADDRESS_729139] agent injection 
 One day after each contrast injection  
Prior to the first injection , all clinically significant abnormal value might be reported in medical 
history section or AE section as  per investigator’ s judgement. After the first contrast agent injection, 
all clinically significant abnormal value , as per investigator’s judgement, will be recorded as AEs. 
o Injection -site tolerance  
For all patients, injection -site tolerance (pain, eruption, extravasation, inflammation, or other)  will be 
assessed over [ADDRESS_729140] injection (during the injection, 60 ± [ADDRESS_729141] injection and the day after injection) and over a longer period if the investigator becomes aware of any related 
AE. In case of injection -site pain, the patient will be asked to specify the level of pain using a Numeric 
Pain intensity Scale (NPS ) from 0 (no pain) to 10 (maximal pain). 
o Local laboratory parameters  
Serum creatinine and eGFR will be obtained from local laboratory of each site prior MRI  and one day 
post IMP injection. The same local methods of serum creatinine dosage and eGFR calculation should 
be used throughout the trial for a same patient. 
According to ESUR guidelines: Post -contrast acute kidney injury (PC_AKI)  is defined as an increase 
i n  s e r u m  c r e a t i n i n e  o f  ≥  0 . 3  m g / d L or of ≥ 1.[ADDRESS_729142] agent.  
For this trial, it is up to investigator to evaluate any change in serum creatinine within trial period as 
clinically significant or not; the investigator  will report any clinically significant change as an AE .. 
o Clinical laboratory parameters  
For each patient, blood samples will be performed from visit 2 to visit 5.  The following parameters will be obtained and assessed  centrally :  
• Hematology: Red Blood Cells (RBCs), White Blood Cells (WBCs), neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes and monocytes, platelet count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, Mean red blood Cells Volume (MCV). 
• Biochemistry: sodium, potassium, chloride, Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) / urea, total protein, calcium, phosphorus, total bilirubin (and indirect bilirubin), conjugated bilirubin, Aspartate 
Amino Transferase (AST), Alanine Amino Transferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase, Lactate 
DeHydrogenase (LDH), Triglycerides, Cystatin C. 
The central laboratory will flag laboratory values falling outside of the normal ranges on the central 
laboratory report (which the investigator should review and sign off). 
Prior to the first injection , all clinically significant abnormal value  might be reported in medical 
history section or AE section as  per investigator’s judgement. After the first contrast agent injection, 
all clinically significant abnormal value , as per investigator’s judgement, will be recorded as AEs. 
o Adverse events  
Adverse Event s will  be recorded throughout patient participation (see section  9.1.2 ).

investigators, or other individuals involved in the trial. 
Images will be evaluated by [CONTACT_555421] a centralized manner. All 
images will be sent to a core laboratory, which will p repare the images for evaluation. The file headers 
of all the images transmitted in DICOM format are to be edited to remove patient or site identification. 
For all images, any sequence information will be removed. A complete audit trail of any changes to 
the file headers will be maintained.  
The blinded image evaluations will be performed by [CONTACT_555446] ( [ADDRESS_729158] will perform lesion tracking ). An 
imaging eCRF will be used to ensure that the images and the diagnostic findings are properly aligned 
and to ensure that all data necessary for the trial purpose are documented by [CONTACT_555447].  
 
8.4.1 Manuals and Supplies  
Guerbet (or its Imaging Core Laboratory) will document the imaging tasks and obligations of the 
investigational site in an Imaging Manual. As defined in Section 8.2.2, the standardized image 
acquisition guidelines or imaging protocol will be provided to the sites as part of the Imaging Manual.  
In addition, the Imaging Manual will de tail the steps required for masking confidential patient 
information and transferring images to the Imaging Core Laboratory .  
Guerbet (or the Imaging Core Laboratory) will document the central imaging process in a Blinded  
Imaging Evaluation Charter . 
 
8.4.2 Site Qualification  
Guerbet’s agent (CRO, Imaging Core Laboratory or monitors) will perform pre -trial site selection. 
This contact [CONTACT_555448], is 
programmed and prepared prior to enrolment of the first patient and that the Imaging Manual will be accurately followed by [CONTACT_093].

8.4.3 Receipt and Tracking of Images  
Guerbet (or its Imaging Core Laboratory) will request that investigational sites s ubmit anonymous 
images to the Imaging Core Laboratory in a format that will be agreed prior to trial start. Images  will 
be tracked in the database of the Imaging Core Laboratory . 
 
8.4.[ADDRESS_729159] been followed. In the event that a problem with an image is identified (e.g.: inappropriate anatomical coverage, 
inconsistency of images parameters with the imaging protocol, poor quality images), the 
investigational site will be notified concerning the nature of the problems and the steps required for corrective action. The Imaging Core Laboratory will follow -up on all cases requiring remedial action 
by [CONTACT_41166]. Guerbet (or the Imaging Core Laboratory) may conduct site training for investigator sites with recurring image quality issues. 
 
8.4.[ADDRESS_729160] to successfully complete training sessions (refer to “ Blinded Image 
Evaluation C harter ” for details).  
Independent readers are readers that are completely unaware of findings of other readers (including findings of other blinded readers and on- site investigators) and are readers who are not otherwise 
influenced by [CONTACT_555449].  
The term “independent” means that the readers involved in centralized review do not participate in 
image acquisition and images are read outside the image acquisition site.  
 
8.4.6 Image Randomization  
When a sufficient number of images are available for  readings, a batch of images will be presented to 
the blinded readers.  
The patients within each batch will be ordered at random without stratification into groups of patients.  
Various modalities of images from the same patient will not be presented in the  same batch and the 
Imaging Core Laboratory will ensure an appropriate wash -out period between the evaluations of 
images from two modalities (Pre & Paired images) and between two MR examinations for the same 
patient, to minimize recall bias.  
 
8.4.7 Blinded Asses sment of Images  
Imaging database including all evaluable images will be assessed by [CONTACT_389259]. The 
reading will be performed in a strictly fully blinded manner.

December 20,  2018 Page 48 / 79 
 
 
No communication on patient  specific image findings will be allowed between the i ndependent 
readers once the blinded reviews begin. 
To ensure that the centralized reading evaluations remain independent, each individual reader 
evaluation will be locked as they occur (i.e., it will not be possible to alter the evaluation). 
 
8.4.8 Inter & Intra -reader Variability Assessment  
The assessments of inter - and intra- reader variability will be done in the final analysis.  
Inter -reader variability will be evaluated on the whole set of trial patients since each patient will be 
read by [CONTACT_555450].  
Intra -reader variability: individual readers will perform repeat image evaluations of 10 % of cases 
randomly determined. The cases used for intra -reader variability assessment will be re-introduced 
randomly and re- read during the course of the reading. To minimize recall bias, intra -reader variability 
will be assessed approximately after the first [ADDRESS_729161] evaluation of a given image set will be included in the efficacy 
analysis.  
 
8.4.9 Lesion tracking/ Matching  
A concordance reading process (lesion tracking) will be performed as an independent off -site 
procedure. The purpose is to guarantee an unambiguous assignment (matching) of the lesions between 
modalities (Pre and Paired images)  of the same MR examination  between two MR examinations for 
the same patient,  and between readers. Lesion tracking will be carried out by [CONTACT_555451] (so- called concordance reader) in blinding condition (except the ID number of lesions) on 
the basis of the off -site readers’ assessments. Once the concordance process is done, 
correspondence/tracking lesion tables should be obtained, so that lesions could be compared for analysis within readers or for the inter - and intra- reader (refer to trial “Blinded Image Evaluation  
Charter” for details).  
 
8.4.10 Image Archive and Final Deliverables  
All imaging data will be maintained in a secure environment. The Imaging Core Laboratory will maintain a centralized image archive that will contain every imaging examination received from the clinical investigators for the trial . Measurements will also be stored so that these data may be audited 
if necessary. A copy of images transferred by [CONTACT_555452]. 
 
8.5  Non Imaging Central procedures : central laboratory 
A central laboratory will be used for all scheduled laboratory tests in this trial except for the pregnancy 
test and creatinine and eGFR  which will be assessed locally. The investigator will be provided with a 
list of normal ranges prior to the start of the trial . The central laboratory will provide the necessary kits 
to collect the blood samples and will also provide appropriate information regarding shippi[INVESTIGATOR_555388] .

according to the below instructions . Special situations such as medication errors, misuses, suspi[INVESTIGATOR_555389], unusual failure in efficacy, overdose (symptomatic or 
not), drug exposure during pregnancy or breastfe eding even if uneventful, suspected drug -drug 
interaction with another product (symptomatic or not)  will also be reported to Guerbet.   
The definition, modalities of collection and reporting are provided below. 
 
9.1 Adverse Event  
9.1.1 Definition of Adverse Event  
An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient  or clinical investigation 
patient  administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with this treatment.  
An AE can therefore be:  
- any unfavorable and unintended sign, including an abnormal finding from an additional 
examination (lab tests, X -ray, ECG…) deemed clinically significant by [CONTACT_093];  
- any symptom or intercurrent disease;  
- any worsening during the trial of a symptom or a disease already present when the patient 
entered the trial (increase in frequency and/or intensity ). 
(Note: for US participating sites only: for Guerbet sponsored clinical studies, the term adverse events 
will be used (as opposed to adverse drug experience )). 
Any disease identified and diagnosed by [CONTACT_555456] . It may  be collected in clinical e CRF as medical history or trial  disease.   
The patient ’s disease under investigation and part of inclusion criteria or any pre -existing disease is 
not reported as AE, nevertheless, any worsening of such pathologies  during the course of the trial has 
to be considered as an AE. 
 
9.1.2 Collection and recording of Adverse Events  
The Investigator or his/her designee will invite the patient  to report any experienced abnormality as 
part of the usual clinical follow -up. In addition, any abnormal finding  assessed as cl inically significant 
in the context of the trial  by [CONTACT_737] (see section 9.1.1 ) should be considered as AE  and 
reported in the AE section of the clinical e CRF . 
All AEs, whether considered as related or not to the IMP  and/or any protocol procedure s including 
imaging procedures, and whether serious or not, should be reported and documented in the medical 
file and the appropriate section of the clinical e CRF  according to the Table 5 .

to the last trial visit in the general case and defined in section [ADDRESS_729163] provide a justification in the medical file and eCRF . 
 
9.1.3 Description of Adverse Events  
The following guidelines and definitions should be used by [CONTACT_555457] e CRF and  any specific AE  report forms : 
• Nature (diagnosis) of AE:  preferably an overall diagnosis or syndrome, rather than individual 
symptoms or signs. The investigator must report AE using standard medical terminology. The same terms should be used in the source documentation and in the  clinical e CRF.  
• Date and time of onset:  date and clock time of the AE start . 
• Intensity:  
o Mild: the patient  is aware of the sign or symptom, but it does not interfere with her/his 
usual daily activities and/or it is of no clinical consequence  
o Moderate:  the AE interferes with the usual daily activities of the patient  or it is of 
some clinical consequence  
o Severe:  the patient is unable to work normally or to carry out his/her usual daily 
activities, and/or AE is of definite clinical consequence.  
• Date of th e event end  (or consolidation) : This date is the date when the event has come to its 
ends or to its initial intensity (for the events that had been an aggravation of a pre-existing disorder) . If the AE is still ongoing by [CONTACT_555458] -up for the patient (i.e. 
last trial visit), the patient  should be followed- up until AE resolution or a justification should 
be provided by [CONTACT_737] (i.e. chronic disease) in the medical file.  
• Causal relationship to the IMP : 
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Protocol No. GDX -44-010 
Version No. V1.0 
December 20,  2018 Page 52 / 79 
 
 
o Related: the definition of adverse reaction  (AR)  implies a reasonable possibility of a 
causal relationship between the event and the IMP. This means that there are facts 
(evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship.  
o Not related: A pplicable when no IMP has been administered (pre -administration 
period) or when no causal relationship exists between the trial drug and the event, but 
an obvious alternative cause exists (e.g. the patient ’s underlying medical condition or 
concomitant therapy). 
• Causal relationship to a trial procedure  (blood test, imaging procedure itself etc…) : 
o Related : the definition of adverse reaction implies a reasonable possibility of a causal 
relationship between the event and the procedure. This means that there are facts 
(evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship.  
 
o Not related : Applicable when no procedure was performed yet or when no causal 
relationship exists between the trial  procedure and the event, but an obvious 
alternative cause exists (e.g. the patient ’s underlying medical condition or 
concomitant therapy). 
• Outcome:  
o Recovered /resolved : the AE is no longer present at any intensity  or return to baseline 
intensity (for pre -existing disorders) or values for biological data . 
o Recovered/resolved with sequelae: the AE is resolved but residual effects are still 
present (to be specified on the AE form). 
o Not recovered /not r esolved : the AE is still present at the last contact [CONTACT_10970] . 
o Fatal: this AE caused or directly contributed to the patient ’s death . 
• Action taken w ith re gard to administration of the IMP: 
o No action : for AE occurring during the pre-treatment/procedure after the post -
treatment/procedure period, or if the IMP dosing/administration would not change in 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_555390] .  
o IMP interrupted: the IMP administration is interrupted (e. g. extravasation…) or the patient  is withdrawn from any other IMP administration planned during the trial but 
without known contra-indication to the drug. 
o IMP definitively discontinued: the event leads to a definite contra- indication to the 
drug (e.g. confirmed hypersensitivity…).  
o IMP unblinding.  
• Other action taken:   
o AE-targeted medication: the patient  took a medication (either prescription or non-
prescription) specifically for this AE. The drug(s) should be reported in the appropriate section of the clinical  eCRF (“concomitant medication ” section) . 
o Other AE -targeted action: therapeutic measures  other th an corrective drug 
administration (e.g. ice, heating pad, brace, cast…) or  patient  underwent a procedure 
(surgery, physiotherapy, additional laboratory test…) for this AE. The therapeutic 
measure(s) should be reported in the appropriate section of the clinical e CRF 
(“procedures/therapeutic measures” section) . 
o Trial  discontinuation: the AE leads to patient  discontinuation from the trial .

• Adverse event of special interest (AESI) should be indicated (see section 9.3.3  for AESI 
definition ) 
• Assessment of the seriousness of the AE : see S ection 9.2 for SAE definition. 
 
9.2 Serious Adverse Event  
9.2.1 Definition of Serious Adverse Event  
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose (ICH E2A) :  
- Results in death  
- Is life -threatening  
- Requires in patient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
- Results in persistent or significant disability / incapacity  
- Is a congenital anomaly / birth defect  
- Is an i mportant medical event 
• Important medical event : medical and scientific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether 
expedited reporting is appropriate in situations  such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_555391]. These 
should also usually be considered serious.  
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] ; or 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
• Life-threatening in the definition of a serious adverse event refers to an event in which the patient 
was at risk of death at  the time of  the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might 
have caused death if it were more severe.   
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_555392]. 
Emergency room visits that do not result in admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_555393]. 
In case of a SAE, the investigator is responsible for the measures to be taken to ensure the safety of the trial patients. 
Severe / Serious:  the term “severe” is used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event 
(within the scale mild, moderate, severe). This is not the same as “serious”, which is based on patient event outcome or action criteria. The event itself may  be severe but  of relatively minor medical 
significance.  
In this protocol, the following situations will not be considered as SAE, providing that they are clearly 
documented as such in the patient ’s source data:  
- Any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_555394], provided there is no aggravation of the disease to which it is related.  
- Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], which are not associated to an adverse event (su ch as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_555395] -up).  
No anticipated SAE is defined in this protocol as patient population under trial is suffering from CNS 
lesion s but not from a specific pathology therefore no anticipated SAE has been identified .

9.2.2  Reporting Serious Adverse Events  (SAE)  
All SAEs  must be reported immediately  by [CONTACT_555459] . Therefore, t he investigator 
must immediately  forward to Guerbet P harmacovigilance department a duly completed report form for 
SAE , AESI  or pregnancy  provided by [CONTACT_555460] , even if it is obvious 
that more data will be needed in order to draw any conclusion:  
- By e-mail to: pharmacovigi lance.headquarters@guerbet .com   
- Or Fax #: + 33 (0)1 45 91 67 70 
In case of emergency, Guerbet Pharmacovigilance department may be contact[CONTACT_6811] :  
+ 33 (0)1 45 91 50 00. 
SAEs, occurring at any time during the patient’s participation to the trial have to be reported also in 
medical file and  in the appropriate section of the clinical e CRF ( see Section  9.1.2 ) 
In order to allow the assessment and eventual subsequent regulatory reporting of the case, the 
following minimum information should be fille d in:  
- Patient ’s details including age, sex and patient ’s trial  identification number,  
- Patient ’s medical history relevant to the assessment of the event , 
- Type of event by [CONTACT_34055] a diagnosis or if not available, symptoms,  
- Date and time of onset of the event ,  
- End date of the event (will be reported in a follow -up report if the event is still ongoing at the 
time of initial  notification) , 
- Date and time of investigational drug administration,  
- Seriousness criterion , 
- Causal relationship to the  investigational drug or procedure (mandatory), 
- Outcome at the time of reporting . 
If the investigator is aware of any new relevant information concerning a SAE (e.g.: outcome or any 
information that can have an impact on the assessment of the seriousness or the causal relationship 
between the SAE and the IMP), he has to send immediately to Guerbet Pharmacovigilance department  
the report form for SAE , AESI or pregnancy duly completed . 
In order to comply with current regulations as well as for compr ehensive assessment purposes, 
additional information (e.g. autopsy results, biological values…) or clarifications may be required by 
[CONTACT_555461] a timely fashion to ensure accurate follow -up and assessment of each case and should be 
transmitted, anonymized, with a specific form  as soon as they are available.  
SAEs should be followed up by [CONTACT_555462], if not 
possible, until stabilization of sequelae.  
SAEs associated with trial procedures are to be notified using the same reporting procedure as 
described above.  
According to local requirements, Guerbet or its representatives will communicate relevant safety information to the appropriate A gency(ies), IEC and/or all active investi gators, as it becomes 
available.  
The transmission of the information to Guerbet does not release the investigator from his 
responsibility to inform the regulatory authorities and or IEC/IRB , if applicable.  
No anticipated SAE has been identified in this trial therefore no modalities of collection and reporting are described.

concern specific to the sponsor’s product or programme, for which ongoing monitoring and rapid 
communication by [CONTACT_35348]. Such an event might warrant 
further inves tigation in order to characteriz e and understand it. 
For Guerbet , the transmission of an AESI to  the Guerbet Pharmacovigilance Department respects  the 
same time frame as an SAE  and should be reported using the report form for SAE, AESI or pregnancy 
. 
The AESI for this protocol is the following: Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis (NSF). 
 
9.3.4 Any suspi[INVESTIGATOR_555396].  
 
9.4 Other important safety issue /  new fact  
Any new data which may lead to a reassessment of the benefits / risks balance of the research or 
product being studied, changes in the use of that product, the conduct of the research or documents 
relating to the trial or to suspend or interrupt or modify the protocol of the trial  or similar searches 
have to be evaluated by [CONTACT_555429] . 
It may include any new event likely to affect the safety of the patient ’s and that may be related to the 
conduct of the trial  or the development of the trial drug such as: 
 A SAE  which could lead to the modification of the conduct of the trial  (ex: SAE 
associated with the trial procedures, S[LOCATION_003]R ). 
 A new major finding from an animal study, 
 A temporary halt of a trial for safety reasons if the trial  is conducted with the same IMP in 
another country by [CONTACT_555463], 
 Recommendations of the safety committee  if any, where relevant for the safety of patient s, 
 Increase in the frequency of an expected event considered as clinically significant.  
According to local requirements, Guerb et or its representatives will communicate relevant safety 
information to the appropriate Agency ( ies), IEC/IRB and/or all active investigators, as it becomes 
available.  
Consequently, this type of important safety issue might lead also to :  
 Urgent safety measures and their notification  
 Substantial trial documents modification s 
 Premature discontinuation of the trial   
 Premature discontinuation of the patient

11 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
The following sections summarize the statistical considerations , which are fully described in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan.  
11.1  Statistical Method  
Primary objective 1 :  superiority of Paired images versus Pre images of gadopi[INVESTIGATOR_555399]- primary criteria  
The null hypothesis is that the difference in mean scores between Paired images and Pre images for 
each of the [ADDRESS_729165] is performed at a one- sided 2.5% significance level for each co -primary criteria.  
All co -primary criteria are considered as following a standard normal distribution. Normality will be 
checked by [CONTACT_555467].  
To conclude that gadopi[INVESTIGATOR_555334]- enhanced MRI is superior to unenhanced MRI , the null hypothesis has 
to be  rejected for all co -criteria  simultaneously hence the overall T ype I error rate does not need  to be 
adjusted. 
 
Primary objective 2: non-inferiority of gadopi[INVESTIGATOR_555400] -primary criteria  
The null hypothesis is that the difference in mean scores between gadopi[INVESTIGATOR_555401] 3 primary criteria is equal to the non- inferiority margin .  
The alternative hypothesis is that the difference in mean scores between gadopi[INVESTIGATOR_555402] 3 primary criteria is greater than the non -inferiori ty margin . 
Student’s t -based two -sided 95% confidence interval (95%CI) of the gadopi[INVESTIGATOR_555334]-gadobutrol 
difference will be calculated for each co -primary criteria and compared to the non -inferiority margin.  
All co -primary criteria are considered as following  a standard normal distribution. Normality will be 
checked by [CONTACT_555467].  
To conclude that gadopi[INVESTIGATOR_555403] , the null hypothesis has to be rejected 
for all co -criteria simultaneously hence the overall Type I error rate does not need to be adjusted.  
Further, after the non- inferiority is demonstrated, the superiority of gadopi[INVESTIGATOR_555404]. No adjustment for multiplicity is needed as it is a simple closed 
testing procedure.  
For FDA,  the primary objective 1 is to be achieved.  
For EMA, both primary objectives 1 and 2 are to be achieved   
 
11.2 Sample Size  
Number of patients for the primary objective  1:

Version No. V1.0

Expecting that for each co -primary criteria, the difference in mean scores will be 0. 35 ([“Paired” – 
“Pre”] within patient mean of lesion scores) with 1.[ADDRESS_729166] 90 % power when using a single group superiority t -test with a 0.025 
one-sided significance level.  
As a 2 0% drop -out rate is expected, sample size increases to 250 patients with CNS lesions . 
The success hypothesis used in the sample calculation (“Paired” lesion score mean  is at least 0. 35 
higher than “Pre” lesion score mean ) is based upon the Gutierrez public ation [10] where the  minimal  
observed difference mean was 0.41 with a SD ranging from 0.5 to 0.8. 
Mean (SD) of the difference between combined unenhanced and gadobutrol-enhanced imaging vs 
unenhanced imaging (N = 336).

3 0.43 (0.50) 0.41 (0.52) 1.06 (0.51) 
 
Considering that in the current trial the scale used is not exactly the same (4 -point scale instead of 3-
point scale for one parameter) and to account a possible greater heterogeneity, the difference is set to 0.[ADDRESS_729167] deviation. 
 
Number of patients for the primary objective 2 : 
- Non-inferiority margin:  
For EMA, both primary objectives [ADDRESS_729168] 
demonstration of the superiority of gadopi[INVESTIGATOR_555405] (objective 1). So, it 
can be considered as three -armed trial design with u nenhanced images as placebo as described in EMA 
guideline on the choice of the non- inferiority margin  [11]. As such, it is not necessary to define a 
value for non- inferiority margin to establish that gadopi[INVESTIGATOR_555406]. 
A 10% non- inferiority margin was considered clinically as an unimportant difference and therefore 
relevant to establish acceptable efficacy relative to gadobutrol (objective 2). Based on the Guerbet Phase IIb GDX -44-004 clinical trial results of lesion visualization criteria, the mean score for each of  
the 3 co-criteria is expected to be equal to 3.5, so the margin is set to 0.35 (10%).

Considering that the results for gado butrol would be similar  (meaning that the standard deviation of 
the difference is expected ranging from √2*0.50=0.7 to √2*0.80=1.15) and taking into account a 
possible greater heterogeneity  of patient population to be included in the trial , the expected standard 
deviation of difference between gadopi[INVESTIGATOR_555408] 1.75.  
  
For this 2x2 cross -over design, the statistical analysis is based on the observed Student’s t -based two -
sided 95% confidence interval (95%CI) of the  gadopi[INVESTIGATOR_555334]- gadobutrol difference for each co- primary 
criteria. An enrollment of 200  patients is deemed necessary for the lower limit of the 95% CI to exceed 
the non- inferiority margin set to 0. 35. Assuming 80% power and for each co- primary criteria, the  
expected difference in mean scores is [ADDRESS_729169] deviation of 1.75. If one assumed a patient drop- out rate of 20%, a minimum enrollment of 250  patients with CNS 
lesions is planned.  
Therefore, a total number of 250 patients will allow a s ufficient power to meet both primary 
objectives .

11.3.3 Protocol Deviations  
As per International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) E3 guideline, a protocol deviation is any 
change, divergence or departure from the trial  design or procedures defined in the protocol, with or 
without impact to the patient safety or the efficacy assessments.  
Protocol deviations will be gathered from monitoring files, clinical database and external vendors of 
off-site data (imaging, laboratory data…).  
Protocol deviations will be split in major and non-major  deviations. A major deviation is defined as a 
deviation having an impact on the primary criterion. 
Examples of protocol deviations to be stated as major are following: 
• Patient not presenting, at the time of inclusion, with known or highly suspected focal areas of 
disrupted Blood Brain Barrier 
• Imaging protocol not respected with major impact on primary criterion 
• Informed consent not signed 
• IMP not injected  
 
Other major deviations can be specified during the course of the trial and the exhaustive list of major 
and non- major deviations will be provided in the statistical analysis plan.  
Major and non-major deviations will be presented apart by [CONTACT_555469]. 
11.3.4 Demographics and Baseline  Characteristics  
Demographic parameters are age, sex, race, ethnic origin, childbearing potential, body weight, height, 
and body mass index (BMI). Baseline characteristics are the patient 's history (including the medical 
history, the clinical indication for MRI and the presence or absence of brain metastasis) and the 
concomitant treatments.  
Summary statistics (number [n], mean, standard deviation [SD], median, minimum, and maximum) will be calculated for age, body weight, height and BMI. Frequency and percentages will be calculated 
for sex, patient’s  history characteristics and concomitant treatments.  
Patient 's medical history will be coded using the MedDRA dictionary and tabulated by [CONTACT_6764], 
preferred term and status (concomitant or not).  
Patient 's concomitant treatments will be coded using the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC)  
Drug dictionary and tabul ated by [CONTACT_157840].  
Demographics and baseline characteristics will be displayed by [CONTACT_555469].

The absolute (mL) and relative (%) differences between theoretical and actual volumes of trial product will be presented by [CONTACT_555471] . 
11.3.6 Efficacy Analysis   
Primary analysis  
Superiority of Paired images versus Pre images of gadopi[INVESTIGATOR_555411] -primary criteria  (for objective 1) 
For gadopi[INVESTIGATOR_555334], the difference “Paired” - ”Pre” for e ach of 3 co-primary criteri a 1 will be analyzed 
using paired t -tests using the FAS 1. Results will be presented per reader.

As soon as the non- inferiority is demonstrated, the superiority of the gadopi[INVESTIGATOR_555334] o ver gadobutrol will 
be tested using the same method  and using the  FAS2 and  PPS2. No adjustment for multiplicity is 
needed as it is a simple closed testing procedure.  
Secondary a nalyse s  
Additional analysis of the co -primary criteria   
Supportive analyses of the non-inferiority  analysis  
The non- inferiority  analysis will be repeated using the FAS2 .  
Assay sensitivity:   
For gadobutrol, the difference “Paired” - ”Pre” for each of 3 co -primary criteria will be analyzed using 
the same analysi s as described for superiority on the FAS 2. Results will be presented per off- site 
reader.   
 
Intra -reader variability  
Intra -reader variability will be analyzed in a subgroup of 10% of patients randomly selected for whom 
the off -site readers have re- read the images.  
Intra -reader variability will be stu died by a Bland- Altman graph. Descriptive statistics and the Intra-
Class Correlation (ICC) will also be provided.  The analyses will be performed using the FAS1 and FAS2. 
 
Inter - reader variability  
Inter -reader variability will be evaluated on the whole set of trial patients , since each case was read by 
[ADDRESS_729174] agent groups,  except otherwise specified.

Vital signs  
Vital signs will be analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively  by [CONTACT_555483] . Qualitative analyses 
will be done via  comparison of vital signs data to their normal ranges (see section 7.2.10) and 
according to their clinical ly significant changes. Quantitative analyses will be done by [CONTACT_555484].

11.4.4 Multicenter  Trial  
As a high number of sites  is expected for this trial, the site factor will not be included in the models for 
efficacy. The number of patients included in each site  will be displayed in a disposition table.  
11.4.5 Multiple Comparisons /Multiplicity  
For FDA, the primary objective 1 is to be achieved. The primary objective 2 will serve as one of the 
secondary objectives.  
For EMA, both primary objectives 1 and 2 are to be achieved   
Therefore, no multiplicity adjustment is needed for this trial as only one objective should be reached 
for FDA and the two primary objectives should be reached simultaneously for EMA.  
Furthermore, each objective (superiority of Paired vs Pre, and non- inferiority of the two contrast 
agents), will be considered achieved only if the null hypothesis is rejected for the [ADDRESS_729181] two readers out of three. Each reader will be analyzed separately.  
 
11.4.6 Use of an "Efficacy Subset" of patients  
As the primary objective 1 is superiority, the corresponding analysis will be done using the Full 
Analysis Set and then the analysis repeated using the Per Protocol Set.  
As the primary objective 2 is non- inferiority, the corresponding analysis will be done using the Per 
Protocol Set and then the analysis will be repeated using the Full Analysis Set.  
11.4.7 Examination of Subgroups  
No examination of subgroups is planned.

approval by [INVESTIGATOR_54146]/Independent Ethics Committee (IRB/IEC) and the 
authorization by [CONTACT_555486]/Competent Authority. The final written approval and 
authorization must be available for a given investigational site when initiating the trial conduct at this 
particul ar site. Amongst all documents required locally, the approval and authorization must be 
obtained for the protocol, investigator’s brochure, the patient informed consent form and any other 
written information or document to be provided to the patients.  
In case of modifications to the trial  protocol, patient  informed consent form or any other written 
information provided to the patient s, or to any trial procedure; the modified documents will be 
submitted to IRB/IEC and Regulatory/Competent Authority opi[INVESTIGATOR_6153].  Modifications may be 
implemented when the final approval and authorization are available.  
In case of an emergency situation when the patient s’ safety may be at risk, Guerbet may implement 
emergency safety measures prior to obtaining IRB/IEC approval and Regulatory/Competent Authority 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]. In parallel to implementing these measures, Guerbet will immediately notify the concerned 
IRB/IEC and Regulatory/Competent Authorities of such implementation. 
The documentation related to the approvals and authorizat ions must be filed in the T rial Master File at 
Guerbet and at the investigational sites in their respective Investigational Site File (ISF).  
Notification of Serious Adverse Events/Reactions to IRB/IEC and Regulatory/Competent Authority 
will be made according to the national requirements. Safety reporting is described in Section  9 of the 
present protocol.  
Notifications of non- compliance / deviations to IRB/IEC and Regulatory/Competent Authority will be 
made according to national requirements of participating countries and according to indiv idual 
IRB/IEC requirements when applicable.

the patient s, the IRB/IEC approval must be obtained prior to implementing the new document(s). 
Patient s who already consented may be asked to confirm their willingness to continue participating in 
writing. In any case, the same information and consent process as described above must be followed. 
 
13.4 Trial  Records  and Archiving  
The investigator/institution should maintain adequate and accurate source documents and trial records 
that include all pertinent observations on each of the site’s trial patient s. Source data should be 
attributable, legible, contemporaneous, original, accurate, and complete. Changes to source data 
should be traceable, should not obscure the original entry, and should be explained if necessary (e.g., 
via an audit trail).  
The investigator is responsible for supervising any individual or party to whom the inve stigator 
delegates trial -related duties and functions conducted at the trial site. 
During the course of the clinical trial, investigational sites must ensure completeness and accuracy of the trial records that are to be filed in the Investigator Site File  (ISF) provided by [CONTACT_555492]. The completeness and accuracy of such files will be checked regularly by [CONTACT_555493] (Clinical Research Associate (CRA) or Monitor). The final check will occur at the close 
out visit when inves tigational site participation is over.  
At the end of the trial, investigational sites must ensure the ISF will be archived in an appropriate way that allows timely access and proper retention of documents. Retention period will be of at least 15 years afte r trial completion. Sites should obtained Guerbet written approval before destroying trial 
documents.

14 QUALITY CONTROL  / QUALITY ASSURANCE  
14.[ADDRESS_729188] Access to Source Data/Documents  
The investigator will allow Guerbet representatives, the persons responsible for the audit, the 
representatives of the Ethics Committees and of the Regulatory Authorities to have direct access to 
source data/documents. 
The investigator must guarantee the safety of the trial  data in the medical files by [CONTACT_555494].  
The investigator undertakes, in accordance with the regulation in force, to make anonymous any 
patient  data before collection by [CONTACT_555429]. Especially the name [CONTACT_555504] s will be 
deleted from any medium such as clinical  eCRF, document for biological results, X -Ray films or 
digital supports.  
- For this trial, the following will be considered as source data: patient s’ medical files, images.  
- If computerized medical files are used, the system must be evaluated by [CONTACT_555429] (or 
representative):  In case printing of files is not possible, the computerized system must be 
validated and access should be granted to Guerbet or its representative. 
If the computerized system is not validated, the in vestigator must, at the start of the trial, print, sign 
and date all the medical files of all patient s and during the trial , print, sign and date in real time each 
data entry and each data change. 
 
14.2 Clinical Monitoring  
Before the trial is conducted at a giv en investigational site and until the trial  is completed/terminated at 
the same given investigational site, Guerbet will mandate a representative to perform a close 
monitoring of the trial conduct that will ensure that the investigational site is properly equipped; the 
staff is adequately experienced and knowledgeable of regulatory and ethical requirements.  Monitors 
contact [CONTACT_555495].  
The representative will perform regular investigational site visits and report all discu ssions, patient  and 
IMP data verification performed with particular attention to patient s’ safety and well -being and trial 
data accuracy and completeness.  All monitoring procedures and requirements will be described in a 
monitoring plan.

14.3.2 Data Reported in the clinical eCRF according to patient Status  
A minimal set of screen failure information is required to ensure transparent reporting of screen failure 
patient  to respond to potential queries from regulatory  authorities.  
Minimal information includes demography, screen failure details (listed on ‘end of trial clinical  eCRF 
page), eligibility criteria, and any serious adverse event (SAE). Additional information such as 
medical history, concomitant medication etc…might be requested in case of SAE.  
For patient s discontinued from the trial after randomization, all data available at the time of 
discontinuation will be reported in the medical file and the clinical eCRF (e.g.: inclusion data, safety 
data, administration data, imaging data, reason for premature discontinuation…). The investigator 
must make every effort to collect and record all follow -up safety information (i.e., adverse events, 
injection -site tolerance, as appropriate), unless the patient  withdraws c onsent for further data 
collection/participation for/in the trial . 
 
14.3.3 Data Management S ystem  
A validated clinical data management system will be used for data process and data storage.  
Data processing and control will be closely managed by [CONTACT_555429]’s represen tative.  
 
14.[ADDRESS_729189], Competent/Regulatory Authorities may also carry out 
an inspection in the facilities of Guerbet and/or the investigational sites. Guerbet will inform all the investigators immediately upon notification of a pending inspection. Likewise, the investigator will 
inform Guerbet of any pending inspection. 
Whether for an audit or for a regulatory inspection, Guerbet and the investigational sites both agree to 
cooperate in full transparency, confidentiality and professional secrecy.  
The investigator must allow the representatives of Guerbet (audit) and/or of the Competent/Regulatory Authorities (inspection):
